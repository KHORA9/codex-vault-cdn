So much has come to our knowledge since then, that a\r\nrevised edition of that book would be out of place. I have thought it\r\nbetter, therefore, to leave it unaltered, and to collect together in\r\nthis _Sequel_ the corrections and additions which the flow of events\r\nmakes necessary, together with my reflections on the present facts.\r\n\r\nBut this book is strictly what it represents itself to be—a _Sequel_;\r\nI might almost have said an Appendix. I have nothing very new to say on\r\nthe fundamental issues. Some of the Remedies which I proposed two years\r\nago are now everybody’s commonplaces, and I have nothing startling to\r\nadd to them. My object is a strictly limited one, namely to provide\r\nfacts and materials for an intelligent review of the Reparation Problem\r\nas it now is.\r\n\r\n“The great thing about this wood,” said M.

He who contradicts this child will soon give\r\nplace to other tutors. Praise, therefore, the beauty of the flames he\r\nwishes to touch, the music of the breaking toy; even urge him forward;\r\nyet waiting with vigilant care, the wise and kindly savior of Society,\r\nfor the right moment to snatch him back, just singed and now attentive.\r\n\r\nI can conceive for this terrifying statesmanship a plausible defense.\r\nMr. Lloyd George took the responsibility for a Treaty of Peace, which\r\nwas not wise, which was partly impossible, and which endangered the\r\nlife of Europe. He may defend himself by saying that he knew that it\r\nwas not wise and was partly impossible and endangered the life of\r\nEurope; but that public passions and public ignorance play a part\r\nin the world of which he who aspires to lead a democracy must take\r\naccount; that the Peace of Versailles was the best momentary settlement\r\nwhich the demands of the mob and the characters of the chief actors\r\nconjoined to permit; and for the life of Europe, that he has spent his\r\nskill and strength for two years in avoiding or moderating the dangers.\r\n\r\nSuch claims would be partly true and cannot be brushed away. The\r\nprivate history of the Peace Conference, as it has been disclosed by\r\nFrench and American participators, displays Mr. Lloyd George in a\r\npartly favorable light, generally striving against the excesses of the\r\nTreaty and doing what he could, short of risking a personal defeat.\r\nThe public history of the two years which have followed it exhibit him\r\nas protecting Europe from as many of the evil consequences of his own\r\nTreaty, as it lay in his power to prevent, with a craft few could have\r\nbettered, preserving the peace, though not the prosperity, of Europe,\r\nseldom expressing the truth, yet often acting under its influence. He\r\nwould claim, therefore, that by devious paths, a faithful servant of\r\nthe possible, he was serving Man.\r\n\r\nHe may judge rightly that this is the best of which a democracy is\r\ncapable,—to be jockeyed, humbugged, cajoled along the right road. A\r\npreference for truth or for sincerity _as a method_ may be a prejudice\r\nbased on some esthetic or personal standard, inconsistent, in\r\npolitics, with practical good.\r\n\r\nWe cannot yet tell. Even the public learns by experience. Will\r\nthe charm work still, when the stock of statesmen’s credibility,\r\naccumulated before these times, is getting exhausted?\r\n\r\nIn any event, private individuals are not under the same obligation\r\nas Cabinet Ministers to sacrifice veracity to the public weal. It is\r\na permitted self–indulgence for a private person to speak and write\r\nfreely. Perhaps it may even contribute one ingredient to the congeries\r\nof things which the wands of statesmen cause to work together, so\r\nmarvelously, for our ultimate good.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor these reasons I do not admit error in having based _The Economic\r\nConsequences of the Peace_ on a literal interpretation of the Treaty\r\nof Versailles, or in having examined the results of actually carrying\r\nit out. I argued that much of it was _impossible;_ but I do not agree\r\nwith many critics, who held that, for this very reason, it was also\r\nharmless. Inside opinion accepted from the beginning many of my main\r\nconclusions about the Treaty.[1] But it was not therefore unimportant\r\nthat outside opinion should accept them also.\r\n\r\nFor there are, in the present times, two opinions; not, as in former\r\nages, the true and the false, but the outside and the inside; the\r\nopinion of the public voiced by the politicians and the newspapers,\r\nand the opinion of the politicians, the journalists and the civil\r\nservants, upstairs and backstairs and behind–stairs, expressed in\r\nlimited circles. In time of war it became a patriotic duty that the two\r\nopinions should be as different as possible; and some seem to think it\r\nso still.\r\n\r\nThis is not entirely new. But there has been a change. Some say that\r\nMr. Gladstone was a hypocrite; yet if so, he dropped no mask in\r\nprivate life. The high tragedians, who once ranted in the Parliaments\r\nof the world, continued it at supper afterwards. But appearances can\r\nno longer be kept up behind the scenes. The paint of public life, if\r\nit is ruddy enough to cross the flaring footlights of to–day, cannot\r\nbe worn in private,—which makes a great difference to the psychology\r\nof the actors themselves. The multitude which lives in the auditorium\r\nof the world needs something larger than life and plainer than the\r\ntruth. Sound itself travels too slowly in this vast theater, and a true\r\nword no longer holds when its broken echoes have reached the furthest\r\nlistener.\r\n\r\nThose who live in the limited circles and share the inside opinion pay\r\nboth too much and too little attention to the outside opinion; too\r\nmuch, because, ready in words and promises to concede to it everything,\r\nthey regard open opposition as absurdly futile; too little, because\r\nthey believe that these words and promises are so certainly destined to\r\nchange in due season, that it is pedantic, tiresome, and inappropriate\r\nto analyze their literal meaning and exact consequences. They know all\r\nthis nearly as well as the critic, who wastes, in their view, his time\r\nand his emotions in exciting himself too much over what, on his own\r\nshowing, cannot possibly happen. Nevertheless, what is said before the\r\nworld is, still, of deeper consequence than the subterranean breathings\r\nand well–informed whisperings, knowledge of which allows inside opinion\r\nto feel superior to outside opinion, even at the moment of bowing to it.\r\n\r\nBut there is a further complication. In England (and perhaps elsewhere\r\nalso), there are _two_ outside opinions, that which is expressed in the\r\nnewspapers and that which the mass of ordinary men privately suspect to\r\nbe true. These two degrees of the outside opinion are much nearer to\r\none another than they are to the inside, and under some aspects they\r\nare identical; yet there is under the surface a real difference between\r\nthe dogmatism and definiteness of the press and the living, indefinite\r\nbelief of the individual man. I fancy that even in 1919 the average\r\nEnglishman never really believed in the indemnity; he took it always\r\nwith a grain of salt, with a measure of intellectual doubt. But it\r\nseemed to him that for the time being there could be little practical\r\nharm in going on the indemnity tack, and also that, in relation to\r\nhis feelings at that time, a belief in the possibility of boundless\r\npayments by Germany was in better sentiment, even if less true, than\r\nthe contrary. Thus the recent modification in British outside opinion\r\nis only partly intellectual, and is due rather to changed conditions;\r\nfor it is seen that perseverance with the indemnity does now involve\r\npractical harm, whilst the claims of sentiment are no longer so\r\ndecisive. He is therefore prepared to attend to arguments, of which he\r\nhad always been aware out of the corner of his eye.\r\n\r\nForeign observers are apt to heed too little these unspoken\r\nsensibilities, which the voice of the press is bound to express\r\nultimately. Inside opinion gradually affects them by percolating to\r\nwider and wider circles; and they are susceptible in time to argument,\r\ncommon sense, or self–interest. It is the business of the modern\r\npolitician to be accurately aware of all three degrees; he must have\r\nenough intellect to understand the inside opinion, enough sympathy to\r\ndetect the inner outside opinion, and enough brass to express the outer\r\noutside opinion.\r\n\r\nWhether this account is true or fanciful, there can be no doubt as\r\nto the immense change in public sentiment over the past two years.\r\nThe desire for a quiet life, for reduced commitments, for comfortable\r\nterms with our neighbors is now paramount. The megalomania of war has\r\npassed away, and every one wishes to conform himself with the facts.\r\nFor these reasons the Reparation Chapter of the Treaty of Versailles is\r\ncrumbling. There is little prospect now of the disastrous consequences\r\nof its fulfilment.\r\n\r\nI undertake in the following chapters a double task, beginning with\r\na chronicle of events and a statement of the present facts, and\r\nconcluding with proposals of what we ought to do. I naturally attach\r\nprimary importance to the latter. But it is not only of historical\r\ninterest to glance at the recent past. If we look back a little closely\r\non the two years which have just elapsed (and the general memory\r\nunaided is now so weak that we know the past little better than the\r\nfuture), we shall be chiefly struck, I think, by the large element\r\nof injurious make–believe. My concluding proposals assume that this\r\nelement of make–believe has ceased to be politically necessary; that\r\noutside opinion is now ready for inside opinion to disclose, and act\r\nupon, its secret convictions; and that it is no longer an act of futile\r\nindiscretion to speak sensibly in public.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[1] “Its merely colorable fulfilment of solemn contracts with a\r\ndefeated nation, its timorous failure to reckon with economic\r\nrealities,” as Professor Allyn Young wrote in a review of my book.\r\nYet Professor Young has thought right, nevertheless, to make\r\nhimself a partial apologist of the Treaty, and to describe it as “a\r\nforward–looking document.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n    FROM THE RATIFICATION OF THE TREATY OF VERSAILLES TO THE SECOND\r\n                          ULTIMATUM OF LONDON\r\n\r\n\r\n         I. _The Execution of the Treaty and the Plebiscites_\r\n\r\nThe Treaty of Versailles was ratified on January 10, 1920, and except\r\nin the plebiscite areas its territorial provisions came into force on\r\nthat date. The Slesvig plebiscite (February and March, 1920) awarded\r\nthe north to Denmark and the south to Germany, in each case by a\r\ndecisive majority. The East Prussian plebiscite (July, 1920) showed an\r\noverwhelming vote for Germany. The Upper Silesian plebiscite (March,\r\n1921) yielded a majority of nearly two to one in favor of Germany for\r\nthe province as a whole,[2] but a majority for Poland in certain areas\r\nof the south and east. On the basis of this vote, and having regard to\r\nthe industrial unity of certain disputed areas, the principal Allies,\r\nwith the exception of France, were of opinion that, apart from the\r\nsoutheastern districts of Pless and Rybnik which, although they contain\r\nundeveloped coalfields of great importance, are at present agricultural\r\nin character, nearly the whole of the province should be assigned to\r\nGermany. Owing to the inability of France to accept this solution,\r\nthe whole problem was referred to the League of Nations for final\r\narbitration. This body bisected the industrial area in the interests of\r\nracial or nationalistic justice; and introduced at the same time, in\r\nthe endeavor to avoid the consequences of this bisection, complicated\r\neconomic provisions of doubtful efficiency in the interests of material\r\nprosperity. They limited these provisions to fifteen years, trusting\r\nperhaps that something will have occurred to revise their decision\r\nbefore the end of that time. Broadly speaking, the frontier has been\r\ndrawn, entirely irrespective of economic considerations, so as to\r\ninclude as large as possible a proportion of German voters on one side\r\nof it and Polish voters on the other (although to achieve this result\r\nit has been thought necessary to assign two almost purely German towns,\r\nKattowitz and Königshütte to Poland). From this limited point of view\r\nthe work may have been done fairly. But the Treaty had directed that\r\neconomic and geographical considerations should be taken into account\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nI do not intend to examine in detail the wisdom of this decision. It\r\nis believed in Germany that subterranean influence brought to bear\r\nby France contributed to the result. I doubt if this was a material\r\nfactor, except that the officials of the League were naturally anxious,\r\nin the interests of the League itself, to produce a solution which\r\nwould not be a fiasco through the members of the Council of the\r\nLeague failing to agree about it amongst themselves; which inevitably\r\nimported a certain bias in favor of a solution acceptable to France.\r\nThe decision raises, I think, much more fundamental doubts about this\r\nmethod of settling international affairs.\r\n\r\nDifficulties do not arise in simple cases. The League of Nations\r\nwill be called in where there is a conflict between opposed and\r\nincommensurable claims. A good decision can only result by impartial,\r\ndisinterested, very well–informed and authoritative persons taking\r\n_everything_ into account. Since International Justice is dealing with\r\nvast organic units and not with a multitude of small units of which\r\nthe individual particularities are best ignored and left to average\r\nthemselves out, it cannot be the same thing as the cut–and–dried\r\nlawyer’s justice of the municipal court. It will be a dangerous\r\npractice, therefore, to entrust the settlement of the ancient conflicts\r\nnow inherent in the tangled structure of Europe, to elderly gentlemen\r\nfrom South America and the far Asiatic East, who will deem it their\r\nduty to extract a strict legal interpretation from the available\r\nsigned documents,—who will, that is to say, take account of as _few_\r\nthings as possible, in an excusable search for a simplicity which is\r\nnot there. That would only give us more judgments of Solomon with the\r\nass’s ears, a Solomon with the bandaged eyes of law, who, when he says\r\n“Divide ye the living child in twain,” means it.\r\n\r\nThe Wilsonian dogma, which exalts and dignifies the divisions of race\r\nand nationality above the bonds of trade and culture, and guarantees\r\nfrontiers but not happiness, is deeply embedded in the conception of\r\nthe League of Nations as at present constituted. It yields us the\r\nparadox that the first experiment in international government should\r\nexert its influence in the direction of intensifying nationalism.\r\n\r\nThese parenthetic reflections have arisen from the fact that from a\r\ncertain limited point of view the Council of the League may be able to\r\nadvance a good case in favor of its decision. My criticism strikes more\r\ndeeply than would a mere allegation of partiality.\r\n\r\nWith the conclusion of the plebiscites the frontiers of Germany were\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nIn January 1920 Holland was called on to surrender the Kaiser; and,\r\nto the scarcely concealed relief of the Governments concerned, she\r\nduly refused (January 23, 1920). In the same month the surrender of\r\nsome thousands of “war criminals” was claimed, but, in the face of a\r\npassionate protest from Germany, was not insisted on. It was arranged\r\ninstead that, in the first instance at least, only a limited number of\r\ncases should be pursued, not before Allied Courts, as provided by the\r\nTreaty, but before the High Court of Leipzig. Some such cases have been\r\ntried; and now, by tacit consent, we hear no more about it.\r\n\r\nOn March 13, 1920, an outbreak by the reactionaries in Berlin (the\r\nKapp “Putsch”) resulted in their holding the capital for five days\r\nand in the flight of the Ebert Government to Dresden. The defeat of\r\nthis outbreak, largely by means of the weapon of the general strike\r\n(the first success of which was, it is curious to note, in defense\r\nof established order), was followed by Communist disturbances in\r\nWestphalia and the Ruhr. In dealing with this second outbreak, the\r\nGerman Government despatched more troops into the district than was\r\npermissible under the Treaty, with the result that France seized the\r\nopportunity, without the concurrence of her Allies, of occupying\r\nFrankfurt (April 6, 1920) and Darmstadt, this being the immediate\r\noccasion of the first of the series of Allied Conferences recorded\r\nbelow—the Conference of San Remo.\r\n\r\nThese events, and also doubts as to the capacity of the Central German\r\nGovernment to enforce its authority in Bavaria, led to successive\r\npostponements of the completion of disarmament, due under the Treaty\r\nfor March 31, 1920, until its final enforcement by the London Ultimatum\r\nof May 5, 1921.\r\n\r\nThere remains Reparation, the chief subject of the chronicle which\r\nfollows. In the course of 1920 Germany carried out certain specific\r\ndeliveries and restitutions prescribed by the Treaty. A vast quantity\r\nof identifiable property, removed from France and Belgium, was duly\r\nrestored to its owners.[3] The Mercantile Marine was surrendered. Some\r\ndyestuffs were delivered, and a certain quantity of coal. But Germany\r\npaid no cash, and the real problem of Reparation was still postponed.[4]\r\n\r\nWith the Conferences of the spring and summer of 1920 there began the\r\nlong series of attempts to modify the impossibilities of the Treaty and\r\nto mold it into workable form.\r\n\r\n\r\n  II. _The Conferences of San Remo_ (_April_ 19–26, 1920), _Hythe_ (_May_\r\n      15 _and June_ 19, 1920), _Boulogne_ (_June_ 21, 22, 1920), _Brussels_\r\n      (_July_ 2–3, 1920), _and Spa_ (_July_ 5–16, 1920)\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to keep distinct the series of a dozen discussions\r\nbetween the Premiers of the Allied Powers which occupied the year from\r\nApril 1920 to April 1921. The result of each Conference was generally\r\nabortive, but the total effect was cumulative; and by gradual stages\r\nthe project of revising the Treaty gained ground in every quarter. The\r\nConferences furnish an extraordinary example of Mr. Lloyd George’s\r\nmethods. At each of them he pushed the French as far as he could, but\r\nnot as far as he wanted; and then came home to acclaim the settlement\r\nprovisionally reached (and destined to be changed a month later) as an\r\nexpression of complete accord between himself and his French colleague,\r\nas a nearly perfect embodiment of wisdom, and as a settlement which\r\nGermany would be well advised to accept as final, adding about every\r\nthird time that, if she did not, he would support the invasion of\r\nher territory. As time went on, his reputation with the French was\r\nnot improved; yet he steadily gained his object,—though this may be\r\nascribed not to the superiority of the method as such, but to facts\r\nbeing implacably on his side.\r\n\r\nThe first of the series, the Conference of San Remo (April 19–26,\r\n1920), was held under the presidency of the Italian Premier, Signor\r\nNitti, who did not conceal his desire to revise the Treaty. M.\r\nMillerand stood, of course, for its integrity, whilst Mr. Lloyd George\r\n(according to _The Times_ of that date) occupied a middle position.\r\nSince it was evident that the French would not then accept any new\r\nformula, Mr. Lloyd George concentrated his forces on arranging for a\r\ndiscussion face to face between the Supreme Council and the German\r\nGovernment, such a meeting, extraordinary to relate, having never yet\r\nbeen arranged, neither during the Peace Conference nor afterwards.\r\nDefeated in a proposal to invite German representatives to San Remo\r\nforthwith, he succeeded in carrying a decision to summon them to\r\nvisit Spa in the following month “for the discussion of the practical\r\napplication of the Reparation Clauses.” This was the first step; and\r\nfor the rest the Conference contented itself with a Declaration on\r\nGerman Disarmament. Mr. Lloyd George had had to concede to M. Millerand\r\nthat the integrity of the Treaty should be maintained; but speaking in\r\nthe House of Commons on his return home, he admitted a preference for a\r\nnot “too literal” interpretation of it.\r\n\r\nIn May the Premiers met in privacy at Hythe to consider their course\r\nat Spa. The notion of the sliding scale, which was to play a great\r\npart in the Paris Decisions and the Second Ultimatum of London, now\r\ncame definitely on the carpet. A Committee of Experts was appointed to\r\nprepare for examination a scheme by which Germany should pay a certain\r\nminimum sum each year, supplemented by further sums in accordance with\r\nher capacity. This opened the way for new ideas, but no agreement was\r\nyet in sight as to actual figures. Meantime the Spa Conference was put\r\noff for a month.\r\n\r\nIn the following month the Premiers met again at Boulogne (June 21,\r\n1920), this meeting being preceded by an informal week–end at Hythe\r\n(June 19, 1920). It was reported that on this occasion the Allies got\r\nso far as definitely to agree on the principle of minimum annuities\r\nextensible in accordance with Germany’s economic revival. Definite\r\nfigures even were mentioned, namely, a period of thirty–five years and\r\nminimum annuities of three milliard gold marks. The Spa Conference was\r\nagain put off into the next month.\r\n\r\nAt last the Spa meeting was really due. Again the Premiers met\r\n(Brussels, July 2, 3, 1920) to consider the course they would adopt.\r\nThey discussed many things, especially the proportions in which the\r\nstill hypothetical Reparation receipts were to be divided amongst\r\nthe claimants.[5] But no concrete scheme was adopted for Reparation\r\nitself. Meanwhile a memorandum handed in by the German experts made\r\nit plain that no plan politically possible in France was economically\r\npossible in Germany. “The Note of the German economic experts,” wrote\r\n_The Times_ on July 3, 1920, “is tantamount to a demand for a complete\r\nrevision of the Peace Treaty. The Allies have therefore to consider\r\nwhether they will call the Germans sharply to order under the menace of\r\ndefinite sanctions, or whether they will risk creating the impression\r\nof feebleness by dallying with German tergiversations.” This was a\r\ngood idea; if the Allies could not agree amongst themselves as to the\r\nprecise way of altering the Treaty, a “complete accord” between them\r\ncould be re–established by “calling the Germans sharply to order” for\r\nventuring to suggest that the Treaty could be altered at all.\r\n\r\nAt last, on July 5, 1920, the long–heralded Conference met. But,\r\nalthough it occupied twelve days, no time was found for reaching\r\nthe item on the agenda which it had been primarily summoned to\r\ndiscuss—namely, Reparations. Before this dangerous topic could be\r\nreached urgent engagements recalled M. Millerand to Paris. One of the\r\nchief subjects actually dealt with, coal, is treated in Excursus I.\r\nat the conclusion of this chapter. But the chief significance of the\r\nmeeting lay in the fact that then for the first time the responsible\r\nministers and experts of Germany and the Allied States met face to face\r\nand used the methods of public conference and even private intimacy.\r\nThe Spa Conference produced no plan; but it was the outward sign of\r\nsome progress under the surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n         III. _The Brussels Conference_ (_December_ 16–22, 1920)\r\n\r\nWhilst the Spa Conference made no attempt to discuss the general\r\nquestion of the Reparation settlement, it was again agreed that the\r\nlatter should be tackled at an early date. But time passed by, and\r\nnothing happened. On September 23, 1920, M. Millerand succeeded to\r\nthe Presidency of the French Republic, and his place as Premier was\r\ntaken by M. Leygues. French official opinion steadily receded from\r\nthe concessions, never fully admitted to the French public, which\r\nMr. Lloyd George had extracted at Boulogne. They now preferred to\r\nlet the machinery of the Reparation Commission run its appointed\r\ncourse. At last, however, on November 6, 1920, after much diplomatic\r\ncorrespondence, it was announced that once again the French and British\r\nGovernments were in “complete accord.” A conference of experts,\r\nnominated by the Reparation Commission, was to sit with German experts\r\nand report; then a conference of ministers was to meet the German\r\nGovernment and report; with these two reports before it the Reparation\r\nCommission was to fix the amount of Germany’s liability; and finally,\r\nthe heads of the Allied Governments were to meet and “take decisions.”\r\n“Thus,” _The Times_ recorded, “after long wanderings in the wilderness\r\nwe are back once more at the Treaty of Versailles.” The re–perusal of\r\nold files of newspapers, which the industrious author has undertaken,\r\ncorroborates, if nothing else does, the words of the Preacher and the\r\ndustiness of fate.\r\n\r\nThe first stage of this long procedure was in fact undertaken, and\r\ncertain permanent officials of the Allied Governments[6] met German\r\nrepresentatives at Brussels, shortly before Christmas 1920, to\r\nascertain facts and to explore the situation generally. This was a\r\nconference of “experts” as distinguished from the conferences of\r\n“statesmen” which preceded and followed it.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Brussels experts was so largely ignored and overthrown\r\nby the meetings of the statesmen at Paris shortly afterwards, that it\r\nis not now worth while to review it in detail. It marked, however,\r\na new phase in our relations with Germany. The officials of the two\r\nsides met in an informal fashion and talked together like rational\r\nbeings. They were representative of the pick of what might be called\r\n“international officialdom,” cynical, humane, intelligent, with a\r\nstrong bias towards facts and a realistic treatment. Both sides\r\nbelieved that progress was being made towards a solution; mutual\r\nrespect was fostered; and a sincere regret was shared at the early\r\nabandonment of reasonable conversations.\r\n\r\nThe Brussels experts did not feel themselves free to consider an\r\naverage payment less than that contemplated at Boulogne. They\r\nrecommended to the Allied Governments, accordingly, (1) that during the\r\nfive years from 1921 to 1926 Germany should pay an _average_ annuity of\r\n$750,000,000, but that this average annuity should be so spread over\r\nthe five years that less than this amount would be payable in the first\r\ntwo years and more in the last two years, the question of the amount of\r\nsubsequent payments, after the expiry of five years, being postponed\r\nfor the present;\r\n\r\n(2) That a substantial part of this sum should be paid in the form of\r\ndeliveries of material and not of cash;\r\n\r\n(3) That the annual expenses of the Armies of Occupation should be\r\nlimited to $60,000,000, which payment need not be additional to the\r\nabove annuities but a first charge on them;\r\n\r\n(4) That the Allies should waive their claim on Germany to build ships\r\nfor them and should perhaps relinquish, or postpone, the claim for the\r\ndelivery of a certain number of the existing German vessels;\r\n\r\n(5) That Germany on her side should put her finances and her budget in\r\norder and should agree to the Allies taking control of her customs in\r\nthe event of default under the above scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n          IV. _The Decisions of Paris_ (_January_ 24–30, 1921)\r\n\r\nThe suggestions of the Brussels experts furnished no permanent\r\nsettlement of the question, but they represented, nevertheless, a\r\ngreat advance from the ideas of the Treaty. In the meantime, however,\r\nopinion in France was rising against the concessions contemplated.\r\nM. Leygues, it appeared, would be unable to carry in the Chamber the\r\nscheme discussed at Boulogne. Prolonged political intrigue ended in the\r\nsuccession of M. Briand to the Premiership, with the extreme defenders\r\nof the literal integrity of the Treaty of Versailles, M. Poincaré, M.\r\nTardieu, and M. Klotz, still in opposition. The projects of Boulogne\r\nand Brussels were thrown into the melting–pot, and another conference\r\nwas summoned to meet at Paris at the end of January 1921.\r\n\r\nIt was at first doubtful whether the proceedings might not terminate\r\nwith a breach between the British and the French points of view. Mr.\r\nLloyd George was justifiably incensed at having to surrender most of\r\nthe ground which had seemed definitely gained at Boulogne; with these\r\nfluctuations negotiation was a waste of time and progress impossible.\r\nHe was also disinclined to demand payments from Germany which _all_\r\nthe experts now thought impossible. For a few days he was entirely\r\nunaccommodating to the French contentions; but as the business\r\nproceeded he became aware that M. Briand was a kindred spirit, and\r\nthat, whatever nonsense he might talk in public, he was secretly quite\r\nsensible. A breach in the conversations might mean the fall of Briand\r\nand the entrance to office of the wild men, Poincaré and Tardieu,\r\nwho, if their utterances were to be taken seriously and were not\r\nmerely a ruse to obtain office, might very well disturb the peace of\r\nEurope before they could be flung from authority. Was it not better\r\nthat Mr. Lloyd George and M. Briand, both secretly sensible, should\r\nremain colleagues at the expense of a little nonsense in unison for a\r\nshort time? This view of the situation prevailed, and an ultimatum was\r\nconveyed to Germany on the following lines.[7]\r\n\r\nThe Reparation payments, proposed to Germany by the Paris Conference,\r\nwere made up of a determinate part and an indeterminate part.\r\nThe former consisted of $500,000,000 per annum for two years,\r\n$750,000,000 for the next three, then $1,000,000,000 for three more,\r\nand $1,250,000,000 for three after that, and, finally, $1,500,000,000\r\nannually for 31 years. The latter (the indeterminate part) consisted of\r\nan annual sum, additional to the above, equal in value to 12 per cent\r\nof the German exports. The fixed payments under this scheme added up to\r\na gross total of $56,500,000,000 which was a little less than the gross\r\ntotal contemplated at Boulogne but, with the export proportion added, a\r\nfar greater sum.\r\n\r\nThe indeterminate element renders impossible an exact calculation of\r\nthis burden, and it is no longer worth while to go into details. But\r\nI calculated at the time, without contradiction, that these proposals\r\namounted for the normal period to a demand exceeding $2,000,000,000 per\r\nannum, which is double the highest figure that any competent person in\r\nGreat Britain or in the United States has ever attempted to justify.\r\n\r\nThe Paris Decisions, however, coming as they did after the discussions\r\nof Boulogne and Brussels, were not meant seriously, and were simply\r\nanother move in the game, to give M. Briand a breathing space. I wonder\r\nif there has ever been anything quite like it—best diagnosed perhaps\r\nas a consequence of the portentous development of “propaganda.”\r\nThe monster had escaped from the control of its authors, and the\r\nextraordinary situation was produced in which the most powerful\r\nstatesmen in the world were compelled by forces, which they could not\r\nevade, to meet together day after day to discuss detailed variations of\r\nwhat they knew to be impossible.\r\n\r\nMr. Lloyd George successfully took care, however, that the bark should\r\nhave no immediate bite behind it. The consideration of effective\r\npenalties was postponed, and the Germans were invited to attend in\r\nLondon in a month’s time to convey their answer by word of mouth.\r\n\r\nM. Briand duly secured his triumph in the Chamber. “Rarely,” _The\r\nTimes_ reported, “can M. Briand in all his long career as a speaker\r\nand Parliamentarian have been in better form. The flaying of M.\r\nTardieu was intensely dramatic, even if at times almost a little\r\npainful for the spectators as well as for the victim.” M. Tardieu\r\nhad overstated his case, and “roundly asserting that the policy of\r\nFrance during the last year had been based on the conclusion that the\r\nfinancial clauses of the Treaty of Versailles could not be executed,\r\nhad gained considerable applause by declaring that this was just the\r\nthesis of the pacifist, Mr. Keynes, and of the German delegate, Count\r\nBrockdorff–Rantzau,”—which was certainly rather unfair to the Paris\r\nDecisions. But by that date, even in France, to praise the perfections\r\nof the Treaty was to make oneself ridiculous. “I am an ingenuous man,”\r\nsaid M. Briand as he mounted the tribune, “and when I received from M.\r\nTardieu news that he was going to interpellate me, I permitted myself\r\nto feel a little pleased. I told myself that M. Tardieu was one of the\r\nprincipal architects of the Treaty of Versailles, and that as such,\r\nthough he knew its good qualities, he would also know its blemishes,\r\nand that he would, therefore, be indulgent to a man who had done\r\nhis best in fulfilling his duty of applying it—_mais voilà_ (with\r\na gesture)—I did not stop to remember that M. Tardieu had already\r\nexpended all his stock of indulgence upon his own handiwork.” The\r\nmonstrous offspring of propaganda was slowly dying.\r\n\r\n\r\n         V. _The First Conference of London_ (_March_ 1–7, 1921)\r\n\r\nIn Germany the Paris proposals were taken seriously and provoked\r\na considerable outcry. But Dr. Simons accepted the invitation to\r\nLondon and his experts got to work at a counter–proposal. “I was\r\nin agreement,” he said at Stuttgart on February 13, “with the\r\nrepresentatives of Britain and France at the Brussels Conference. The\r\nParis Conference shattered that. A catastrophe has occurred. German\r\npublic opinion will never forget these figures. Now it is impossible\r\nto return to the Seydoux plan put forward at Brussels (_i.e._, a\r\nprovisional settlement for five years), for the German people would\r\nalways see enormous demands rising before them like a specter.... We\r\nshall rather accept unjust dictation than sign undertakings we are not\r\nfirmly persuaded the German people can keep.”\r\n\r\nOn March 1, 1921, Dr. Simons presented his counter–proposal to the\r\nAllies assembled in London. Like the original counter–proposal of\r\nBrockdorff–Rantzau at Versailles, it was not clear–cut or entirely\r\nintelligible; and it was rumored that the German experts were divided\r\nin opinion amongst themselves. Instead of stating in plain language\r\nwhat Germany thought she could perform, Dr. Simons started from the\r\nfigures of the Paris Decisions and then proceeded by transparent\r\nand futile juggling to reduce them to a quite different figure. The\r\nprocess was as follows. Take the gross total of the fixed annuities of\r\nthe Paris scheme (_i.e._, apart from the export proportion), namely\r\n$56,500,000,000, and calculate its present value at _8 per cent\r\ninterest_, namely $12,500,000,000; deduct from this $5,000,000,000\r\nas the alleged (but certainly not the actual) value of Germany’s\r\ndeliveries up to date, which leaves $7,500,000,000. This was the\r\nutmost Germany could pay. If the Allies could raise an international\r\nloan of $2,000,000,000, Germany would pay the interest and sinking\r\nfund on this, and in addition $250,000,000 a year for five years,\r\ntowards the discharge of the capital sum remaining over and above the\r\n$2,000,000,000, namely, $5,500,000,000, which capital sum, however,\r\nwould not carry interest pending repayment. At the end of five years\r\nthe rate of repayment would be reconsidered. The whole proposal was\r\ncontingent on the retention of Upper Silesia and the removal of all\r\nimpediments to German trade.\r\n\r\nThe actual substance of this proposal was not unreasonable and probably\r\nas good as the Allies will ultimately secure. But the figures were far\r\nbelow even those of the Brussels experts, and the mode of putting it\r\nforward naturally provoked prejudice. It was summarily rejected.\r\n\r\nTwo days later Mr. Lloyd George read to the German Delegation a\r\nlecture on the guilt of their country, described their proposals as\r\n“an offense and an exasperation,” and alleged that their taxes were\r\n“ridiculously low compared with Great Britain’s.” He then delivered\r\na formal declaration on behalf of the Allies that Germany was in\r\ndefault in respect of “the delivery for trial of the criminals who have\r\noffended against the laws of war, disarmament, and the payment in cash\r\nor kind of $5,000,000,000”; and concluded with an ultimatum[8] to\r\nthe effect that unless he heard by Monday (March 7) “that Germany was\r\neither prepared to accept the Paris Decisions or to submit proposals\r\nwhich would be in other ways an equally satisfactory discharge of her\r\nobligations under the Treaty of Versailles (subject to the concessions\r\nmade in the Paris proposals),” the Allies would proceed to (1) the\r\noccupation of Duisberg, Ruhrort, and Düsseldorf on the right bank of\r\nthe Rhine, (2) a levy on all payments due to Germany on German goods\r\nsent to Allied countries, (3) the establishment of a line of Customs\r\nbetween the occupied area of Germany and the rest of Germany, and (4)\r\nthe retention of the Customs paid on goods entering or leaving the\r\noccupied area.\r\n\r\nDuring the next few days negotiations proceeded, to no purpose, behind\r\nthe scenes. At midnight on March 6, M. Loucheur and Lord D’Abernon\r\noffered the Germans the alternative of a fixed payment of $750,000,000\r\nfor 30 years and an export proportion of 30 per cent.[9] The formal\r\nConference was resumed on March 7. “A crowd gathered outside Lancaster\r\nHouse in the morning and cheered Marshal Foch and Mr. Lloyd George.\r\nShouts of ‘Make them pay, Lloyd George!’ were general. The German\r\ndelegates were regarded with curiosity. General von Seeckt wore uniform\r\nwith a sword. He wore also an eyeglass in the approved manner of the\r\nPrussian officer and bore himself as the incarnation of Prussian\r\nmilitarism. Marshal Foch, Field–Marshal Sir Henry Wilson, and the other\r\nAllied soldiers also wore uniform.”[10]\r\n\r\nDr. Simons communicated his formal reply. He would accept the _régime_\r\nof the Paris Decisions as fixed for the first five years, provided\r\nGermany was helped to pay by means of a loan and retained Upper\r\nSilesia. At the end of five years the Treaty of Versailles would\r\nresume its authority, the provisions of which he preferred, as he was\r\nentitled to do, to the proposals of Paris. “The question of war guilt\r\nis to be decided neither by the Treaty, nor by acknowledgment, nor by\r\nSanctions; only history will be able to decide the question as to who\r\nwas responsible for the world war. We are all of us still too near to\r\nthe event.” The Sanctions threatened were, he pointed out, all of them\r\nillegal. Germany could not be technically in default in respect of\r\nReparation until the Reparation Commission had made the pronouncements\r\ndue from them on May 1. The occupation of further German territory was\r\nnot lawful under the Treaty. The retention of part of the value of\r\nGerman goods was contrary to undertakings given by the British and\r\nBelgian Governments. The erection of a special Customs tariff in the\r\nRhineland was only permissible under Article 270 of the Treaty for\r\nthe protection of the economic interests of the Rhineland population\r\nand not for the punishment of the whole German people in respect of\r\nunfulfilled Treaty obligations. The arguments as to the illegality of\r\nthe Sanctions were indisputable, and Mr. Lloyd George made no attempt\r\nto answer them. He announced that the Sanctions would be put into\r\noperation immediately.\r\n\r\nThe rupture of the negotiations was received in Paris “with a sigh of\r\nrelief,”[11] and orders were telegraphed by Marshal Foch for his troops\r\nto march at 7 A.M. next morning.\r\n\r\nNo new Reparation scheme, therefore, emerged from the Conference of\r\nLondon. Mr. Lloyd George’s acquiescence in the Decisions of Paris had\r\nled him too far. Some measure of personal annoyance at the demeanor of\r\nthe German representatives and the failure of what, in its inception,\r\nmay have been intended as bluff, had ended in his agreeing to an\r\nattempt to enforce the Decisions by the invasion of Germany. The\r\neconomic penalties, whether they were legal or not, were so obviously\r\nineffective for the purpose of collecting money, that they can hardly\r\nhave been intended for that purpose, and were rather designed to\r\nfrighten Germany into putting her name to what she could not, and did\r\nnot intend to perform, by threatening a serious step in the direction\r\nof the policy, openly advocated in certain French quarters, of\r\npermanently detaching the Rhine provinces from the German Commonwealth.\r\nThe grave feature of the Conference of London lay partly in Great\r\nBritain’s lending herself to a furtherance of this policy, and partly\r\nin contempt for the due form and processes of law.\r\n\r\nFor it was impossible to defend the legality of the occupation\r\nof the three towns under the Treaty of Versailles.[12] Mr. Lloyd\r\nGeorge endeavored to do so in the House of Commons, but at a later\r\nstage of the debate the contention was virtually abandoned by the\r\nAttorney–General.\r\n\r\nThe object of the Allies was to compel Germany to accept the Decisions\r\nof Paris. But Germany’s refusal to accept these proposals was within\r\nher rights and not contrary to the Treaty, since they lay outside the\r\nTreaty and included features unauthorized by the Treaty which Germany\r\nwas at liberty either to accept or to reject. It was necessary,\r\ntherefore, for the Allies to find some other pretext. Their effort in\r\nthis direction was perfunctory, and consisted, as already recorded, in\r\na vague reference to war criminals, disarmament, and the payment of 20\r\nmilliard gold marks.\r\n\r\nThe allegation of default in paying the 20 milliard gold marks was\r\nmanifestly untenable at that date (March 7, 1921); for according to\r\nthe Treaty, Germany had to pay this sum by May 1, 1921, “in such\r\ninstalments and in such manner as the Reparation Commission may fix,”\r\nand in March 1921 the Reparation Commission had not yet demanded these\r\ncash payments.[13] But assuming that there had been technical default\r\nin respect of the war criminals and disarmament (and the original\r\nprovisions of the Treaty had been so constantly modified that it was\r\nvery difficult to say to what extent this was the case), it was our\r\nduty to state our charges precisely, and, if penalties were threatened,\r\nto make these penalties dependent on a failure to meet our charges. We\r\nwere not entitled to make vague charges, and then threaten penalties\r\nunless Germany agreed to something which had nothing to do with the\r\ncharges. The Ultimatum of March 7 substituted for the Treaty the\r\nintermittent application of force in exaction of varying demands. For\r\nwhenever Germany was involved in a technical breach of any one part\r\nof the Treaty, the Allies were, apparently, to consider themselves\r\nentitled to make any changes they saw fit in any other part of the\r\nTreaty.\r\n\r\nIn any case the invasion of Germany beyond the Rhine was not a lawful\r\nact under the Treaty. This question became of even greater importance\r\nin the following month, when the French announced their intention of\r\noccupying the Ruhr. The legal issue is discussed in Excursus II. at the\r\nconclusion of this Chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n   VI. _The Second Conference of London_ (_April_ 29–_May_ 5, 1921)\r\n\r\nThe next two months were stormy. The Sanctions embittered the situation\r\nin Germany without producing any symptoms of surrender in the German\r\nGovernment. Towards the end of March the latter sought the intervention\r\nof the United States and transmitted a new counter–proposal through the\r\nGovernment of that country. In addition to being straightforward and\r\nmore precise, this offer was materially better than that of Dr. Simons\r\nin London at the beginning of the month. The chief provisions[14] were\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n1. The German liability to be fixed at $12,500,000,000 present value.\r\n\r\n2. As much of this as possible to be raised immediately by an\r\ninternational loan, issued on attractive terms, of which the proceeds\r\nwould be handed over to the Allies, and the interest and sinking fund\r\non which Germany would bind herself to meet.\r\n\r\n3. Germany to pay interest on the balance at 4 per cent for the present.\r\n\r\n4. The sinking fund on the balance to vary with the rate of Germany’s\r\nrecovery.\r\n\r\n5. Germany, in part discharge of the above, to take upon herself the\r\nactual reconstruction of the devastated areas on any lines agreeable to\r\nthe Allies, and in addition to make deliveries in kind on commercial\r\nlines.\r\n\r\n6. Germany is prepared, “up to her powers of performance,” to assume\r\nthe obligations of the Allies to America.\r\n\r\n7. As an earnest of her good intentions, she offers $250,000,000 in\r\ncash immediately.\r\n\r\nIf this is compared with Dr. Simons’s first offer, it will be seen that\r\nit is at least 50 per cent better, because there is no longer any talk\r\nof deducting from the total of $12,500,000,000 an alleged (and in fact\r\nimaginary) sum of $5,000,000,000 in respect of deliveries prior to May\r\n1, 1921. If we assume an international loan of $1,250,000,000, costing\r\n8 per cent for interest and sinking fund,[15] the German offer amounted\r\nto an immediate payment of $550,000,000 per annum, with a possibility\r\nof an increase later in proportion to the rate of Germany’s economic\r\nrecovery.\r\n\r\nThe United States Government, having first ascertained privately that\r\nthis offer would not be acceptable to the Allies, refrained from its\r\nformal transmission.[16] On this account, and also because it was\r\novershadowed shortly afterwards by the Second Conference of London,\r\nthis very straightforward proposal has never received the attention\r\nit deserves. It was carefully and precisely drawn up, and probably\r\nrepresented the full maximum that Germany could have performed, if not\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nBut the offer, as I have said, made very little impression; it was\r\nlargely ignored in the press, and scarcely commented on anywhere.\r\nFor in the two months which elapsed between the First and Second\r\nConferences of London there were two events of great importance, which\r\nmodified the situation materially.[17]\r\n\r\nThe first of these was the result of the Silesian plebiscite held\r\nin March 1921. The earlier German Reparation offers had all been\r\ncontingent on her retention of Upper Silesia; and this condition was\r\none which, in advance of the plebiscite, the Allies were unable to\r\naccept. But it now appeared that Germany was in fact entitled to most\r\nof the country, and, possibly, to the greater part of the industrial\r\narea. But this result also brought to a head the acute divergence\r\nbetween the policy of France and the policy of the other Allies towards\r\nthis question.\r\n\r\nThe second event was the decision of the Reparation Commission,\r\ncommunicated to Germany on April 27, 1921, as to her aggregate\r\nliabilities under the Treaty. Allied Finance Ministers had foreshadowed\r\n300 milliard gold marks; at the time of the Decisions of Paris,\r\nresponsible opinion expected 160–200 milliards;[18] and the author\r\nof _The Economic Consequences of the Peace_ had suffered widespread\r\ncalumny for fixing on the figure of 137 milliards,[19] as being the\r\nnearest estimate he could make. The public, and the Government also,\r\nwere, therefore, taken by surprise when the Reparation Commission\r\nannounced that they unanimously assessed the figure at 132 milliards\r\n(_i.e._, $33,000,000,000).[20] It now turned out that the Decisions\r\nof Paris, which had been represented as a material amelioration of the\r\nTreaty which Germany was ungrateful not to accept, were no such thing;\r\nand that Germany was at that moment suffering from an invasion of her\r\nterritory for a refusal to subscribe to terms which were severer in\r\nsome respects than the Treaty itself. I shall examine the decision of\r\nthe Reparation Commission in detail in Chapter IV. It put the question\r\non a new basis and the Decisions of London could hardly have been\r\npossible otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe decision of the Reparation Commission and the arrival of the date,\r\nMay 1, 1921, fixed in the Treaty for the promulgation of a definite\r\nReparation scheme, provided a sufficient ground for reopening the whole\r\nquestion. Germany had refused the Decisions of Paris; the Sanctions had\r\nfailed to move her; the régime of the Treaty was therefore reinstated;\r\nand under the Treaty it was for the Reparation Commission to propose a\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances the Allies met once more in London in the\r\nclosing days of April 1921. The scheme there concerted was really\r\nthe work of the Supreme Council, but the forms of the Treaty were\r\npreserved, and the Reparation Commission were summoned from Paris to\r\nadopt and promulgate as their own the decree of the Supreme Council.\r\n\r\nThe Conference met in circumstances of great tension. M. Briand had\r\nfound it necessary to placate his Chamber by announcing that he\r\nintended to occupy the Ruhr on May 1. The policy of violence and\r\nillegality, which began with the Conference of Paris, had always\r\nincluded hitherto just a sufficient ingredient of make–believe to\r\nprevent its being as dangerous as it pretended to the peace and\r\nprosperity of Europe. But a point had now been reached when something\r\ndefinite, whether good or bad, seemed bound to happen; and there was\r\nevery reason for anxiety. Mr. Lloyd George and M. Briand had walked\r\nhand–in–hand to the edge of a precipice; Mr. Lloyd George had looked\r\nover the edge; and M. Briand had praised the beauties of the prospect\r\nbelow and the exhilarating sensations of a descent. Mr. Lloyd George,\r\nhaving indulged to the full his habitual morbid taste for looking over,\r\nwould certainly end in drawing back, explaining at the same time how\r\nmuch he sympathized with M. Briand’s standpoint. But would M. Briand?\r\n\r\nIn this atmosphere the Conference met, and, considering all the\r\ncircumstances, including the past commitments of the principals,\r\nthe result was, on the whole, a victory for good sense, not least\r\nbecause the Allies there decided to return to the pathway of legality\r\nwithin the ambit of the Treaty. The new proposals, concerted at this\r\nConference, were, whether they were practicable or not in execution,\r\na lawful development of the Treaty, and in this respect sharply\r\ndistinguished from the Decisions of Paris in the January preceding.\r\nHowever bad the Treaty might be, the London scheme provided a way of\r\nescape from a policy worse even than that of the Treaty,—acts, that\r\nis, of arbitrary lawlessness based on the mere possession of superior\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nIn one respect the Second Ultimatum of London was lawless; for it\r\nincluded an illegal threat to occupy the Ruhr Valley if Germany\r\nrefused its terms. But this was for the sake of M. Briand, whose\r\nminimum requirement was that he should at least be able to go home\r\nin a position to use, for conversational purposes, the charms of the\r\nprecipice from which he was hurrying away. And the Ultimatum made\r\nno demand on Germany to which she was not already committed by her\r\nsignature to the Treaty.\r\n\r\nFor this reason the German Government was right, in my judgment,\r\nto accept the Ultimatum unqualified, even though it still included\r\ndemands impossible of fulfilment. For good or ill Germany had signed\r\nthe Treaty. The new scheme added nothing to the Treaty’s burdens,\r\nand, although a reasonable permanent settlement was left where it\r\nwas before,—in the future,—in some respects it abated them. Its\r\nratification, in May 1921, was in conformity with the Treaty, and\r\nmerely carried into effect what Germany had had reason to anticipate\r\nfor two years past. It did not call on her to do immediately—that is\r\nto say, in the course of the next six months—anything incapable of\r\nperformance. It wiped out the impossible liability under which she lay\r\nof paying forthwith a balance of $3,000,000,000 due under the Treaty\r\non May 1. And, above all, it obviated the occupation of the Ruhr and\r\npreserved the peace of Europe.\r\n\r\nThere were those in Germany who held that it must be wrong that Germany\r\nshould under threats profess insincerely what she could not perform.\r\nBut the submissive acceptance by Germany of a lawful notice under a\r\nTreaty she had already signed committed her to no such profession,\r\nand involved no recantation of her recent communication through the\r\nPresident of the United States as to what would eventually prove in her\r\nsincere belief to be the limits of practicable performance.\r\n\r\nIn the existence of such sentiments, however, Germany’s chief\r\ndifficulty lay. It has not been understood in England or in America how\r\ndeep a wound has been inflicted on Germany’s self–respect by compelling\r\nher, not merely to perform acts, but to subscribe to beliefs which she\r\ndid not in fact accept. It is not usual in civilized countries to use\r\nforce to compel wrongdoers to confess, even when we are convinced of\r\ntheir guilt; it is still more barbarous to use force, after the fashion\r\nof inquisitors, to compel adherence to an article of belief because we\r\nourselves believe it. Yet towards Germany the Allies had appeared to\r\nadopt this base and injurious practice, and had enforced on this people\r\nat the point of the bayonet the final humiliation of reciting, through\r\nthe mouths of their representatives, what they believed to be untrue.\r\n\r\nBut in the Second Ultimatum of London the Allies were no longer in\r\nthis fanatical mood, and no such requirement was intended. I hoped,\r\ntherefore, at the time that Germany would accept the notification of\r\nthe Allies and do her best to obey it, trusting that the whole world\r\nis not unreasonable and unjust, whatever the newspapers may say; that\r\nTime is a healer and an illuminator; and that we had still to wait a\r\nlittle before Europe and the United States could accomplish in wisdom\r\nand mercy the economic settlement of the war.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              EXCURSUS I\r\n\r\n                                 COAL\r\n\r\nThe question of coal has always considerable importance for Reparation,\r\nboth because (in spite of the exaggerations of the Treaty) it is a form\r\nin which Germany can make important payments, and also because of the\r\nreaction of coal deliveries on Germany’s internal economy. Up to the\r\nmiddle of 1921 Germany’s payments for Reparation were almost entirely\r\nin the form of coal. And coal was the main topic of the Spa Conference,\r\nwhere for the first time the Governments of the Allies and of Germany\r\nmet face to face.\r\n\r\nUnder the terms of the Treaty Germany was to deliver 3,400,000 tons\r\nof coal per month. For reasons explained in detail in _The Economic\r\nConsequences of the Peace_ (pp. 74–89) this total was a figure of\r\nrhetoric and not capable of realization. Accordingly for the first\r\nquarter of 1920 the Reparation Commission reduced their demand to\r\n1,660,000 tons per month, and in the second quarter to 1,500,000 tons\r\nper month; whilst in the second quarter Germany actually delivered\r\nat the rate of 770,000 tons per month. This last figure was unduly\r\nlow, and by the latter date coal was in short supply throughout the\r\nworld and very dear. The main object of the Spa Coal Agreement was,\r\ntherefore, to secure for France an increased supply of German coal.\r\n\r\nThe Conference was successful in obtaining coal, but on terms not\r\nunfavorable to Germany. After much bargaining the deliveries were\r\nfixed at 2,000,000 tons a month for six months from August 1920. But\r\nthe German representatives succeeded in persuading the Allies that\r\nthey could not deliver this amount unless their miners were better\r\nfed and that this meant foreign credit. The Allies agreed, therefore,\r\nto _pay_ Germany something substantial for this coal, the sums thus\r\nreceived to be utilized in purchasing from abroad additional food\r\nfor the miners. In form, the greater part of the sum thus paid was a\r\nloan; but, since it was set off as a prior charge against the value of\r\nReparation deliveries (_e.g._, the ships), it really amounted to paying\r\nback to Germany the value of a part of these deliveries. Germany’s\r\ntotal cash receipts[21] under these arrangements actually came to about\r\n360,000,000 gold marks,[22] which worked out at about 40s. per ton\r\naveraged over the whole of the deliveries. As at this time the German\r\ninternal price was from 25s. to 30s. per ton, the German Government\r\nreceived in foreign currency substantially more than they had to pay\r\nfor the coal to the home producers. The high figure of 2,000,000 tons\r\nper month involved short supplies to German transport and industry.\r\nBut the money was badly wanted, and was of the utmost assistance\r\nin paying for the German food program (and also in meeting German\r\nliabilities in respect of pre–war debts) during the autumn and winter\r\nof 1920.\r\n\r\nThis is a convenient point at which to record the subsequent history\r\nof the coal deliveries. During the next six months Germany very nearly\r\nfulfilled the Spa Agreement, her deliveries towards the 2,000,000 tons\r\nper month being 2,055,227 tons in August, 2,008,470 tons in September,\r\n2,288,049 tons in October, 1,912,696 tons in November, 1,791,828 tons\r\nin December, and 1,678,675 tons in January 1921. At the end of January\r\n1921 the Spa Agreement lapsed, and since that time Germany has had to\r\ncontinue her coal deliveries without any payment or advance of cash\r\nin return for them. To make up for the accumulated deficit under the\r\nSpa Agreement, the Reparation Commission called for 2,200,000 tons per\r\nmonth in February and March, and continued to demand this figure in\r\nsubsequent months. Like so much else, however, this demand was only\r\non paper. Germany was not able to fulfil it, her actual deliveries\r\nduring the next six months amounting to 1,885,051 tons in February\r\n1921, 1,419,654 tons in March, 1,510,332 tons in April, 1,549,768 tons\r\nin May, 1,453,761 tons in June, and 1,399,132 tons in July. And the\r\nReparation Commission, not really wanting the coal, tacitly acquiesced\r\nin these quantities. During the first half of 1921 there was, in fact,\r\na remarkable reversal of the situation six months earlier. In spite of\r\nthe British Coal Strike, France and Belgium, having replenished their\r\nstocks and suffering from a depression in the iron and steel trades,\r\nwere in risk of being glutted with coal. If Germany had complied with\r\nthe full demands of the Reparation Commission the recipients would not\r\nhave known what to do with the deliveries. Even as it was, some of the\r\ncoal received was sold to exporters, and the coal miners of France and\r\nBelgium were in danger of short employment.\r\n\r\nThe statistics of the aggregate German output of pit coal are now as\r\nfollows, exclusive of Alsace–Lorraine, the Saar, and the Palatinate, in\r\nmillion tons:\r\n\r\n  ─────────────────┬──────┬──────┬──────┬──────┬──────┬────────────\r\n                   │ 1913.│ 1917.│ 1918.│ 1919.│ 1920.│ 1921 (first\r\n                   │      │      │      │      │      │nine months)\r\n  ─────────────────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼────────────\r\n  Germany exclusive│      │      │      │      │      │\r\n   of Upper Silesia│130.19│111.66│109.54│ 92.76│ 99.66│    76.06\r\n  Germany inclusive│      │      │      │      │      │\r\n   of Upper Silesia│173.62│154.41│148.19│117.69│131.35│   100.60\r\n  Per cent of 1913 │      │      │      │      │      │\r\n   output          │100.00│ 88.90│ 85.40│ 67.80│ 75.70│    77.20\r\n  ─────────────────┴──────┴──────┴──────┴──────┴──────┴────────────\r\n\r\nThe production of rough lignite (I will not risk controversy by\r\nattempting to convert this into its pit–coal equivalent) rose from 87.1\r\nmillion tons in 1913 to 93.8 in 1919, 111.6 in 1920, and 90.8 in the\r\nfirst three–quarters of 1921.\r\n\r\nThe Spa Agreement supplied a temporary palliative of the anomalous\r\nconditions governing the _price_ at which these coal deliveries are\r\ncredited to Germany. But with the termination of this Agreement they\r\nagain require attention. Under the Treaty Germany is credited in the\r\ncase of coal delivered _overland_ with “the German pithead price to\r\nGerman nationals” plus the freight to the frontier; and in the case\r\nof coal delivered _by sea_ with the export price; provided in each\r\ncase this price is not in excess of the British export price. Now for\r\nvarious internal reasons the German Government have thought fit to\r\nmaintain the pithead price to German nationals far below the world\r\nprice, with the result that she gets credited with much less than its\r\nreal value for her deliveries of Reparation coal. During the year\r\nending June 1921 the average legal maximum price of the different\r\nkinds of coal was about 270 marks a ton, inclusive of a tax of 20 per\r\ncent on the price,[23] which at the exchange then prevailing was about\r\n20s., _i.e._, between a third and a half of the British price at that\r\ndate. The fall in the mark exchange in the autumn of 1921 increased the\r\ndiscrepancy. For although the price of German coal was substantially\r\nincreased in terms of paper marks, and although the price of British\r\ncoal had fallen sharply, the movements of exchange so out–distanced the\r\nother factors, that in November 1921 the price of British coal worked\r\nout at about three and half times the price of the best bituminous coal\r\nfrom the Ruhr. Thus not only were the German iron–masters placed in an\r\nadvantageous position for competing with British producers, but the\r\nBelgian and French industries also benefited artificially through the\r\nreceipt by their Governments of very low–priced coal.\r\n\r\nThe German Government is in rather a dilemma in this matter. An\r\nincrease in the coal tax is one of the most obvious sources for an\r\nincreased revenue, and such a tax would be, from the standpoint of\r\nthe exchequer, twice blessed, since it would increase correspondingly\r\nthe Reparation credits. But on the other hand, such a proposal unites\r\ntwo groups against them, the industrialists, who want cheap coal for\r\nindustry and the Socialists who want cheap coal for the domestic stove.\r\nFrom the revenue standpoint the tax would probably stand an increase\r\nfrom 20 per cent to 60 per cent; but from the political standpoint an\r\nincrease from 20 per cent to 30 per cent is the highest contemplated at\r\npresent, with a differential price in favor of domestic consumers.[24]\r\n\r\nI take this opportunity of making a few corrections or amplifications\r\nof the passages in _The Economic Consequences of the Peace_ which deal\r\nwith coal.\r\n\r\n1. The fate of Upper Silesia is highly relevant to some of the\r\nconclusions about coal in Chapter IV of _The Economic Consequences\r\nof the Peace_ (pp. 77–84). I there stated that “German authorities\r\nclaim, not without contradiction, that to judge from the votes cast\r\nat elections, one–third of the population would elect in the Polish\r\ninterest, and two–thirds in the German,” which forecast turned out to\r\nbe in almost exact accordance with the facts. I also urged that, unless\r\nthe plebiscite went in a way which I did not expect, the industrial\r\ndistricts ought to be assigned to Germany. But I felt no confidence,\r\nhaving regard to the policy of France, that this would be done; and\r\nI allowed, therefore, in my figures for the possibility that Germany\r\nwould lose this area.\r\n\r\nThe actual decision of the Allies, acting on the advice of the Council\r\nof the League of Nations to whom the matter had been referred, which\r\nwe have discussed briefly above (pp. 12–14), divides the industrial\r\ntriangle between the two claimants to it. According to an estimate\r\nof the Prussian Ministry of Trade 86 per cent of the total coal\r\ndeposits of Upper Silesia fall to Poland, leaving 14 per cent to\r\nGermany. Germany retains a somewhat larger proportion of pits in actual\r\noperation, 64 per cent of the current production of coal falling to\r\nPoland and 36 per cent to Germany.[25]\r\n\r\nThe figure of 100,000,000 tons, given in _The Economic Consequences\r\nof the Peace_ for the _net_ German production (_i.e._, deducting\r\nconsumption at the mines themselves) in the near future _excluding_\r\nUpper Silesia, should, therefore, be replaced by the figure of (say)\r\n115,000,000 tons, _including_ such part of Upper Silesia as Germany is\r\nnow to retain.\r\n\r\n2. I beg leave to correct a misleading passage in a footnote to p. 79\r\nof _The Economic Consequences of the Peace_. I there spoke of “Poland’s\r\npre–war annual demand” for coal, where I should have said “pre–war\r\nPoland’s pre–war annual demand.” The mistake was not material, as I\r\nallowed for Germany’s diminished requirements for coal, due to loss of\r\nterritory, in the body of the text. But I confess that the footnote,\r\nas published, might be deemed misleading. At the same time it is, I\r\nthink, a tribute to the general accuracy of _The Economic Consequences_\r\nthat partizan critics should have fastened so greedily on the omission\r\nof the word “pre–war” before the word “Poland” in the footnote in\r\nquestion. Quite a considerable literature has grown up round it. The\r\nPolish Diet devoted January 20, 1921, to the discussion and patriotic\r\nanalysis of this footnote, and concluded with a Resolution ordering\r\nthe chief speech of the occasion (that of Deputy A. Wierzlicki) to be\r\npublished throughout the world in several languages at the expense of\r\nthe State. I apologize for any depreciation in the Polish mark for\r\nwhich I may have been so inadvertently responsible. Mr. Wierzlicki\r\nbegins: “A book appeared by Keynes ... the author of a well–known work\r\non India, that pearl of the English crown, that land which is a beloved\r\nsubject of study to the English. Through such studies a man may win\r\nhimself name and fame,”—which was certainly a little unscrupulous of\r\nme. And he concludes: “But England too must believe in facts! And if\r\nKeynes, whose book is impregnated with a humanitarian spirit and with\r\nunderstanding of the necessity to get up beyond selfish interests,\r\nif Keynes is convinced by actual data that he has done a wrong, that\r\nhe has wrought confusion in the ideas of statesmen and politicians\r\nas regards Upper Silesia, then he too will see with his eyes and\r\nmust become the friend of Poland, of Poland as an active factor in\r\nthe development of the natural wealth of Silesia.” I owe it to so\r\ngenerous and eloquent a critic to quote the corrected figures, which\r\nare as follows: the Polish lands, united by the Peace Treaty into the\r\nnew Polish State, consumed in 1913 19,445,000 tons of coal, of which\r\n8,989,000 tons were produced within that area and 7,370,000 tons were\r\nimported from Upper Silesia (the total production of Upper Silesia in\r\nthat year being 43,800,000 tons).[26] The Silesian Plebiscite has been\r\npreceded and followed by a mass of propagandist literature on both\r\nsides. For the economic questions involved see, particularly, on the\r\nPolish side: Wierzlicki, _The Truth about Upper Silesia_; Olszewski,\r\n_Upper Silesia, Her Influence on the Solvability and on the Economic\r\nLife of Germany_, and _The Economic Value of Upper Silesia for Poland\r\nand Germany respectively_; and on the German side: Sidney Osborne, _The\r\nUpper Silesian Question and Germany’s Coal Problem, The Problem of\r\nUpper Silesia_ (papers by various authors, not all on the German side,\r\nwith excellent maps, edited by Sidney Osborne), various pamphlets by\r\nProfessor Schulz–Gavernitz, and documents circulated by the Breslau\r\nChamber of Commerce.\r\n\r\n3. My observations on Germany’s capacity to deliver reparation coal\r\nhave been criticized in some quarters[27] on the ground that I made\r\ninsufficient allowance for the compensation which is available to\r\nher by the more intensive exploitation of her deposits of lignite\r\nor brown coal. This criticism is scarcely fair, because I was the\r\nfirst in popular controversy to call attention to the factor of\r\nlignite, and because I was careful from the outset to disclaim expert\r\nknowledge of the subject.[28] I still find it difficult, in the face\r\nof conflicting expert opinions, to know how much importance to attach\r\nto this material. Since the Armistice there has been a substantial\r\nincrease in output, which was 36 per cent higher in the first half\r\nof 1921 than in 1913.[29] In view of the acute shortage of coal this\r\noutput must have been of material assistance towards meeting the\r\nsituation. The deposits are near the surface, and no great amount\r\nof capital or machinery is needed for its production. But lignite\r\nbriquette is a substitute for coal for certain purposes only, and the\r\nevidence is conflicting as to whether any further material expansion is\r\neconomically practicable.[30]\r\n\r\nThe process of briquetting the rough lignite is probably a wasteful\r\none, and it is doubtful whether it would be worth while to set up _new_\r\nplant with a view to production on a larger scale. Some authorities\r\nhold that the real future of lignite and its value as an element in the\r\nfuture wealth of Germany lie in improved methods of _distillation_ (the\r\nchief obstacle to which, as also to other uses, lies in its high water\r\ncontent), by which the various oils, ammonia and benzine, latent in it\r\ncan be released for commercial uses.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly the case that the future possibilities of lignite\r\nshould not be overlooked. But there is a tendency at present, just\r\nas was the case with potash some little time ago, to exaggerate its\r\nimportance greatly as a decisive factor in the wealth–producing\r\ncapacity of Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              EXCURSUS II\r\n\r\n          THE LEGALITY OF OCCUPYING GERMANY EAST OF THE RHINE\r\n\r\nThe years 1920 and 1921 have been filled with excursions and with\r\nthreats of excursions by the French Army into Germany east of the\r\nRhine. In March 1920 France, without the approval of her Allies,\r\noccupied Frankfort and Darmstadt. In July 1920 a threat to invade\r\nGermany by the Allies as a whole was successful in enforcing the Spa\r\nAgreement. In March 1921 a similar threat was unsuccessful in securing\r\nassent to the Paris Decisions, and Duisberg, Ruhrort, and Düsseldorf\r\nwere occupied accordingly. In spite of the objections of her Allies\r\nFrance continued this occupation when, by the acceptance of the second\r\nUltimatum of London, the original occasion for it had disappeared, on\r\nthe ground that so long as the Upper Silesian question was unsettled,\r\nit was in the opinion of Marshal Foch just as well to retain this\r\nhold.[31] In April 1921 the French Government announced their intention\r\nof occupying the Ruhr, though they were prevented from carrying this\r\nout by the pressure of the other Allies. In May 1921 the Second\r\nUltimatum of London was successfully enforced by a threat to occupy\r\nthe Ruhr Valley. Thus, within the space of little more than a year the\r\ninvasion of Germany, beyond the Rhine, was threatened five times and\r\nactually carried out twice.\r\n\r\nWe are supposed to be at peace with Germany, and the invasion of a\r\ncountry in time of peace is an irregular act, even when the invaded\r\ncountry is not in a position to resist. We are also bound by our\r\nadhesion to the League of Nations to avoid such action. It is,\r\nhowever, the contention of France, and apparently, from time to time,\r\nthat of the British Government also, that these acts are in some way\r\npermissible under the Treaty of Versailles, whenever Germany is in\r\ntechnical default in regard to any part of the Treaty, that is to say,\r\nsince some parts of the Treaty are incapable of literal fulfilment, at\r\nany time. In particular the French Government maintained in April 1921\r\nthat so long as Germany possessed any tangible assets capable of being\r\nhanded over, she was in voluntary default in respect of Reparation,\r\nand that if she was in voluntary default any Ally was entitled to\r\ninvade and pillage her territory without being guilty of an act of war.\r\nIn the previous month the Allies as a whole had argued that default\r\nunder Chapters of the Treaty, other than the Reparation Chapter, also\r\njustified invasion.\r\n\r\nThough the respect shown for legality is now very small, the legal\r\nposition under the Treaty deserves nevertheless an exact examination.\r\n\r\nThe Treaty of Versailles expressly provides for breaches by Germany of\r\nthe _Reparation_ Chapter. It contains no special provision for breaches\r\nof other Chapters, and such breaches are, therefore, in exactly the\r\nsame position as breaches of any other Treaty. Accordingly, I will\r\ndiscuss separately default in respect of Reparation, and other defaults.\r\n\r\nSections 17 and 18 of the Reparation Chapter, Annex II. run as follows:\r\n\r\n“(17) In case of default by Germany in the performance of any\r\nobligation under this part of the present Treaty, the Commission will\r\nforthwith give notice of such default to each of the interested Powers,\r\nand will make such recommendations as to the action to be taken in\r\nconsequence of such default as it may think necessary.\r\n\r\n“(18) The measures which the Allied and Associated Powers shall have\r\nthe right to take in case of voluntary default by Germany, and which\r\nGermany agrees not to regard as acts of war, may include economic\r\nand financial prohibitions and reprisals, and in general such other\r\nmeasures as the respective Governments may determine to be necessary in\r\nthe circumstances.”\r\n\r\nThere is also a provision in Article 430 of the Treaty, by which any\r\npart of the occupied area which has been evacuated may be reoccupied if\r\nGermany fails to observe her obligations with regard to Reparation.\r\n\r\nThe French Government base their contention on the words “and in\r\ngeneral such other measures” in § 18, arguing that this gives them\r\nan entirely free hand. The sentence taken as a whole, however,\r\nsupports, on the principle of _ejusdem generis_, the interpretation\r\nthat the other measures contemplated are of the nature of economic\r\nand financial reprisals. This view is confirmed by the fact that the\r\nrest of the Treaty narrowly limits the rights of occupying German\r\nterritory, which, as M. Tardieu’s book shows, was the subject of an\r\nacute difference of opinion between France and her Associates at the\r\nPeace Conference. There is _no_ provision for occupying territory on\r\nthe _right_ bank of the Rhine; and the only provision for occupation in\r\nthe event of default is that contained in Article 430. This Article,\r\nwhich provides for _reoccupation_ of the _left_ bank in the event of\r\ndefault, would have been entirely pointless and otiose if the French\r\nview were correct. Indeed the theory, that at any time during the next\r\nthirty years any Ally can invade any part of Germany on the ground that\r\nGermany has not fulfilled every letter of the Treaty, is on the face of\r\nit unreasonable.\r\n\r\nIn any case, however, §§ 17, 18 of Annex II. of the Reparation Chapter\r\nonly operate after a specific procedure has been set on foot by the\r\nReparation Commission. It is the duty of the Reparation Commission to\r\ngive notice of the default to each of the interested Powers, including\r\npresumably the United States, and to recommend action. If the default\r\nis voluntary—there is no provision as to who is to decide this—then\r\nthe paragraphs in question become operative. There is no warrant\r\nhere for isolated action by a single Ally. And indeed the Reparation\r\nCommission have never so far put this procedure in operation.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, Germany is alleged to be in default under some\r\nother Chapter of the Treaty, then the Allies have no recourse except\r\nto the League of Nations; and they are bound to bring into operation\r\nArticle 17 of the Covenant, which provides for the case of a dispute\r\nbetween a member of the League and a non–member. That is to say,\r\napart from procedure by the Reparation Commission as set forth above,\r\nbreaches or alleged breaches of this Treaty are in precisely the same\r\nposition as breaches of any other treaty between two Powers which are\r\nat peace.\r\n\r\nAccording to Article 17, in the event of a dispute between a member\r\nof the League and a State which is not a member of the League, the\r\nlatter “shall be invited to accept the obligations of membership in\r\nthe League for the purposes of such dispute, upon such conditions\r\nas the Council may deem just. If such invitation is accepted, the\r\nprovisions of Articles 12 to 16 inclusive shall be applied, with such\r\nmodifications as may be deemed necessary by the Council. Upon such\r\ninvitation being given, the Council shall immediately institute an\r\ninquiry into the circumstances of the dispute, and recommend such\r\naction as may seem best and most effectual in the circumstances.”\r\n\r\nArticles 12 to 16 provide, amongst other things, for arbitration in\r\nany case of “disputes as to the interpretation of a Treaty; as to\r\nany question of international law; as to the existence of any fact\r\nwhich, if established, would constitute a breach of any international\r\nobligation; or as to the extent and nature of the reparation to be made\r\nfor any such breach.”\r\n\r\nThe Allies as signatories of the Treaty and of the Covenant are\r\ntherefore absolutely precluded in the event of a breach or alleged\r\nbreach by Germany of the Treaty, from proceeding except under the power\r\ngiven to the Reparation Commission as stated above, or under Article 17\r\nof the Covenant. Any other act on their part is illegal.\r\n\r\nIn any case it is _obligatory_ on the Council of the League, under\r\nArticle 17, to invite Germany, in the event of a dispute between\r\nGermany and the Allies, to accept the obligations of membership in the\r\nLeague for the purposes of such dispute, and to institute immediately\r\nan inquiry into the circumstances of the dispute.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion the protest addressed by the German Government to the\r\nCouncil of the League of Nations in March 1921 was correctly argued.\r\nBut, as with the inclusion of pensions in the Reparation Bill, we\r\nreserve the whole stock of our indignation over illegality between\r\nnations for the occasions when it is the fault of others. I am told\r\nthat to object to this is to overlook “the human element” and is\r\ntherefore both wrong and foolish.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] More exactly, out of 1,220,000 entitled to vote and 1,186,000\r\nactual voters, 707,000 votes or seven–elevenths were cast for Germany,\r\nand 479,000 votes or four–elevenths for Poland. Out of 1522 communes,\r\n844 showed a majority for Germany and 678 for Poland. The Polish voters\r\nwere mainly rural, as is shown by the fact that in 36 towns Germany\r\npolled 267,000 votes against 70,000 for Poland, and in the country\r\n440,000 votes against 409,000 for Poland.\r\n\r\n[3] Up to May 31, 1920, securities and other identifiable assets to\r\nthe value of 8300 million francs and 500,000 tons of machinery and raw\r\nmaterial had been restored to France (_Report of Finance Commission of\r\nFrench Chamber_, June 14, 1920), also 445,000 head of live stock.\r\n\r\n[4] Up to May, 1921, the _cash_ receipts of the Reparation Commission\r\namounted to no more than 124,000,000 gold marks.\r\n\r\n[5] See Excursus VI.\r\n\r\n[6] Lord D’Abernon and Sir John Bradbury for Great Britain, Seydoux and\r\nCheysson for France, d’Amelio and Giannini for Italy, Delacroix and\r\nLepreux for Belgium, and, in accordance with custom, two Japanese. The\r\nGerman representatives included Bergmann, Havenstein, Cuno, Melchior,\r\nvon Stauss, Bonn, and Schroeder.\r\n\r\n[7] The text of these Decisions is given in Appendix No. 2.\r\n\r\n[8] The full text is given in Appendix No. 4.\r\n\r\n[9] Compare this with the fixed payment of $500,000,000 and an export\r\nproportion of 26 per cent proposed in the second Ultimatum of London,\r\nonly two months later.\r\n\r\n[10] _The Times_, March 8, 1921.\r\n\r\n[11] _The Times_, March 8, 1921.\r\n\r\n[12] A week or two later the German Government made a formal appeal to\r\nthe League of Nations against the legality of this act; but I am not\r\naware that the League took any action on it.\r\n\r\n[13] A few weeks later the Reparation Commission endeavored to put the\r\naction of the Supreme Council in order, by demanding one milliard marks\r\nin gold ($250,000,000), that is to say, the greater part of the reserve\r\nof the Reichsbank against its note issue. This demand was afterwards\r\ndropped.\r\n\r\n[14] The full text is given in Appendix No. 5.\r\n\r\n[15] The practicability of such a loan on a large scale is of course\r\nmore than doubtful.\r\n\r\n[16] The German Government is reported also to have offered,\r\nalternatively, to accept any sum which the President of the United\r\nStates might fix.\r\n\r\n[17] After the enforcement of the Sanctions and the failure of the\r\ncounter–proposals, the Cabinet of Herr Fehrenbach and Dr. Simons was\r\nsucceeded by that of Dr. Wirth.\r\n\r\n[18] As late as January 26, 1921, M. Doumer gave a forecast of 240\r\nmilliards.\r\n\r\n[19] Exclusive of sums due in repayment of war loans made to Belgium.\r\n\r\n[20] Exclusive of sums due in repayment of war loans made to Belgium.\r\n\r\n[21] Under the Spa Agreement (see Appendix No. 1) Germany was to be\r\npaid in cash 5 gold marks per ton for _all_ coal delivered, and, in\r\nthe case of coal delivered _overland_, “lent” (_i.e._, advanced out\r\nof Reparation receipts) the difference between the German inland\r\nprice and the British export price. At the date of the Spa Conference\r\nthis difference was about 70s. per ton (100s. less 30s.), but this\r\nsum was not to be advanced in the case of the undetermined amount of\r\ncoal delivered _by sea_. The advances were made by the Allies in the\r\nproportions, 61 per cent by France, 24 per cent by Great Britain, and\r\n15 per cent by Belgium and Italy.\r\n\r\n[22] For details of these payments see p. 133.\r\n\r\n[23] This very valuable tax, first imposed in 1917, yielded in 1920–21\r\nmks. 4½ milliards.\r\n\r\n[24] Dr. Wirth’s first Government prepared a Bill to raise the tax to\r\n30 per cent, with power, however, to reduce the rate temporarily to 25\r\nper cent. It was estimated that the 30 per cent tax would bring in a\r\nrevenue of 9.2 milliard marks.\r\n\r\n[25] The same authority estimates that 85.6 of Upper Silesia’s zinc\r\nore production and all the zinc smelting works fall to Poland. This is\r\nof some importance, since before the war Upper Silesia was responsible\r\nfor 17 per cent of the total world production of zinc. Of the iron and\r\nsteel production of the area 63 per cent falls to Poland. I am not in\r\na position to check any of these figures. Some authorities ascribe a\r\nhigher proportion of the coal to Poland.\r\n\r\n[26] These are the figures according to the Polish authorities. But it\r\nis difficult to obtain accurate pre–war figures for an area which was\r\nnot coterminous with any then existing State; and these totals have\r\nbeen questioned in detail by Dr. W. Schotte.\r\n\r\n[27] See _e.g._, my controversy with M. Brenier in _The Times_.\r\n\r\n[28] In _The Economic Consequences of the Peace_, p. 92 _n._, I wrote\r\nas follows: “The reader must be reminded in particular that the above\r\ncalculations take no account of the German production of lignite....\r\nI am not competent to speak on the extent to which the loss of coal\r\ncan be made good by the extended use of lignite or by economies in\r\nits present employment; but some authorities believe that Germany may\r\nobtain substantial compensation for her loss of coal by paying more\r\nattention to her deposits of lignite.”\r\n\r\n[29] That is to say, production in the middle of 1921 was at the rate\r\nof about 120,000,000 tons per annum. At that time the legal maximum\r\nprice was 60 paper marks per ton (_i.e._, 5s. or less); so that the\r\nnational _profit_ on the output in terms of money cannot have been a\r\nvery material amount.\r\n\r\n[30] In order to secure the increased output the number of miners was\r\nincreased much more than in proportion, namely from 59,000 in 1913 to\r\n171,000 in the first half of 1921. As a result, the cost of production\r\nof lignite rose much faster than that of coal. Also since its calorific\r\nvalue is much less than that of coal per unit of weight (even when it\r\nis briquetted), it can only compete with coal, unless it is assisted by\r\npreferential freight rates, within a limited area in the neighborhood\r\nof the mines.\r\n\r\n[31] At the Paris Conference of August 1921 Lord Curzon tried\r\nunavailingly to persuade France to abandon this illegal occupation.\r\nThe so–called “Economic Sanctions” were raised on October 1, 1921. The\r\noccupation still continues, though both the above pretexts have now\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                  THE BURDEN OF THE LONDON SETTLEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe settlement of Reparations communicated to Germany by the Allied\r\nPowers on May 5, 1921, and accepted a few days later, constitutes the\r\ndefinitive scheme under the Treaty according to which Germany for the\r\nnext two generations is to discharge her liabilities.[32] It will not\r\nendure. But it is the _fait accompli_ of the hour, and, therefore,\r\ndeserves examination.[33]\r\n\r\nThe settlement falls into three parts comprising (1) provisions for the\r\ndelivery of Bonds; (2) provisions for setting up in Berlin an Allied\r\nCommittee of Guarantees; (3) provisions for actual payment in cash and\r\nkind.\r\n\r\n1. _The Delivery of Bonds._—These provisions are the latest variant of\r\nsimilar provisions in the Treaty itself. Allied Finance Ministers have\r\nencouraged themselves (or their constituents) with the hope that some\r\npart of the capital sum of Germany’s liabilities might be anticipated\r\nby the sale to private investors of Bonds secured on future Reparation\r\npayments. For this purpose it was necessary that Germany should deliver\r\nnegotiable Bonds. These Bonds do not constitute any _additional_ burden\r\non Germany. They are simply documents constituting a title to the sums\r\nwhich, under other clauses, Germany is to pay over annually to the\r\nReparation Commission.\r\n\r\nThe advantages to the Allies of marketing such Bonds are obvious. If\r\nthey could get rid of the Bonds they would have thrown the risk of\r\nGermany’s default on to others; they would have interested a great\r\nnumber of people all over the world in Germany’s not defaulting;\r\nand they would have secured the actual cash which the exigencies of\r\ntheir Budgets demand. But the hope is illusory. When at last a real\r\nsettlement is made, it may be practicable for the German Government to\r\nfloat an international loan of moderate amount, well within the world’s\r\nestimate of their minimum capacity of payment. But, though there are\r\nfoolish investors in the world, it would be sanguine to believe that\r\nthere are so many of such folly as to swallow at this moment on these\r\nlines a loan of vast dimensions. It costs France at the present time\r\nsomewhere about 10 per cent to float a loan of modest dimensions on\r\nthe New York market. As the proposed German Bonds will carry 5 per\r\ncent interest and 1 per cent sinking fund, it would be necessary to\r\nreduce their price to 57 before they would yield 10 per cent including\r\nredemption. It would be very optimistic, therefore, to expect to\r\nmarket them at above half their par value. Even so, the world is not\r\nlikely to invest in them any large proportion of its current savings,\r\nso that the whole amount even of the A Bonds, specified below, could\r\nnot be marketed at this price. Moreover, in so far as the service of\r\nthe Bonds marketed is within the _minimum_ expectation of Germany’s\r\ncapacity to pay (as it would have to be), the financial effect on the\r\nAlly which markets the Bonds is nearly the same as though they were\r\nto borrow themselves at the rate in question. Except, therefore, in\r\nthe case of those Allies whose credit is inferior to Germany’s, the\r\nadvantage compared with borrowing on their own credit would not be very\r\nmaterial.[34]\r\n\r\nThe details relating to the Bonds are not likely, therefore, to be\r\noperative, and need not be taken very seriously. They are really a\r\nrelic of the pretenses of the Peace Conference days. Briefly, the\r\narrangements are as follows:\r\n\r\nGermany must deliver 12 milliards of gold marks ($3,000,000,000) in A\r\nBonds, 38 milliards ($9,500,000,000) in B Bonds, and the balance of her\r\nliabilities, provisionally estimated at 82 milliards ($20,500,000,000),\r\nin C Bonds. All the Bonds carry 5 per cent interest and 1 per cent\r\ncumulative sinking fund. The services of the series A, B, and C\r\nconstitute respectively a first, second, and third charge on the\r\navailable funds. The A Bonds are issued to the Reparation Commission\r\nas from May 1, 1921, and the B Bonds as from November 1, 1921, but\r\nthe C Bonds shall not be issued (and shall not carry interest in\r\nthe meantime) except as and when the Reparation Commission is of\r\nthe opinion that the payments which Germany is making under the new\r\nsettlement are adequate to provide their service.\r\n\r\nIt may be noticed that the service of the A Bonds will cost\r\n$180,000,000 per annum, a sum well within Germany’s capacity, and\r\nthe service of the B Bonds will cost $570,000,000 per annum, making\r\n$750,000,000 altogether, a sum in excess of my own expectations of\r\nwhat is practicable, but not in excess of the figure at which some\r\nindependent experts, whose opinion deserves respect, have estimated\r\nGermany’s probable capacity to pay. It may also be noticed that\r\nthe aggregate face value of the A and B Bonds ($12,500,000,000)\r\ncorresponds to the figure at which the German Government have agreed\r\n(in their counter–proposal transmitted to the United States) that their\r\naggregate liability might be assessed. It is probable that, sooner or\r\nlater, the C Bonds at any rate will be not only postponed, but canceled.\r\n\r\n2. _The Committee of Guarantees._—This new body, which is to have a\r\npermanent office in Berlin, is in form and status a sub–commission\r\nof the Reparation Commission. Its members consist of representatives\r\nof the Allies represented on the Reparation Commission, with a\r\nrepresentative of the United States, if that country consents to\r\nnominate.[35] To it are assigned the various wide and indefinite powers\r\naccorded by the Treaty of Peace to the Reparation Commission, for the\r\ngeneral control and supervision of Germany’s financial system. But its\r\nexact functions, in practice and in detail, are still obscure.\r\n\r\nAccording to the letter of its constitution the Committee might embark\r\non difficult and dangerous functions. Accounts are to be opened in\r\nthe name of the Committee, to which will be paid over in _gold or\r\nforeign currency_ the proceeds of the German Customs, 26 per cent of\r\nthe value of all exports and the proceeds of any other taxes which\r\nmay be assigned as a “guarantee” for the payment of Reparation. These\r\nreceipts, however, chiefly accrue not in gold or foreign currency, but\r\nin paper marks. If the Committee attempts to regulate the conversion\r\nof these paper marks into foreign currencies, it will in effect become\r\nresponsible for the foreign exchange policy of Germany, which it would\r\nbe much more prudent to leave alone. If not, it is difficult to see\r\nwhat the “guarantees” really add to the other provisions by which\r\nGermany binds herself to make payments in foreign money.\r\n\r\nI suspect that the only real and useful purpose of the Committee of\r\nGuarantees is as an office of the Reparation Commission _in Berlin_,\r\na highly necessary adjunct; and the clause about “guarantees” is\r\nmerely one more of the pretenses, which, in all these agreements, the\r\nrequirements of politics intermingle with the provisions of finance.\r\nIt is usual, particularly in France, to talk much about “guarantees,”\r\nby which is meant, apparently, some device for making sure that\r\nthe impossible will occur. A “guarantee” is not the same thing as\r\na “sanction.” When M. Briand is accused of weakness at the Second\r\nConference of London and of abandoning France’s “real guarantees,”\r\nthese provisions enable him to repudiate the charge indignantly. He\r\ncan point out that the Second Conference of London not only set up a\r\nCommittee of Guarantees but secured, as a new and additional guarantee,\r\nthe German Customs. There is no answer to that![36]\r\n\r\n3. _The Provisions for Payment in Cash and Kind._—The Bonds and the\r\nGuarantees are apparatus and incantation. We come now to the solid part\r\nof the settlement, the provisions for payment.\r\n\r\nGermany is to pay in each year, until her aggregate liability is\r\ndischarged:\r\n\r\n(1) Two milliard gold marks.\r\n\r\n(2) A sum equivalent to 26 per cent of the value of her exports, or\r\nalternatively an equivalent amount as fixed in accordance with any\r\nother index proposed by Germany and accepted by the Commission.\r\n\r\n(1) is to be paid quarterly on January 15, April 15, July 15, and\r\nOctober 15 of each year, and (2) is to be paid quarterly on February\r\n15, May 15, August 15, and November 15 of each year.\r\n\r\nThis sum, calculated on any reasonable estimate of the future value\r\nof German exports, is materially less than the original demands of\r\nthe Treaty. Germany’s total liability under the Treaty amounts to 138\r\nmilliard gold marks (inclusive of the liability for Belgian debt). At\r\n5 per cent interest and 1 per cent sinking fund, the annual charge on\r\nthis would be 8.28 milliard gold marks. Under the new scheme the annual\r\nvalue of Germany’s exports would have to rise to the improbable figure\r\nof 24 milliard gold marks before she would be liable for so much as\r\nthis. As we shall see below, the probable burden of the new settlement\r\nin the near future is probably not much more than half that of the\r\nTreaty.\r\n\r\nThere is another important respect in which the demands of the Treaty\r\nare much abated. The Treaty included a crushing provision by which the\r\npart of Germany’s nominal liability on which she was not able to pay\r\ninterest in the early years was to accumulate at compound interest.[37]\r\nThere is no such provision in the new scheme; the C Bonds are not to\r\ncarry interest until the receipts from Germany are adequate to meet\r\ntheir service; and the only provision relating to back interest is for\r\nthe payment of _simple_ interest in the event of there being a surplus\r\nout of the receipts.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand how great an advance this settlement represented\r\nit is necessary to carry our minds back to the ideas which were\r\nprevalent not very long ago. The following table is interesting, in\r\nwhich, in order to reduce capital sums and annual payments to a common\r\nbasis of comparison, estimates in terms of capital sums are replaced\r\nby annuities of 6 per cent of their amount:\r\n\r\n                                  In terms of Annuities\r\n        Estimates of             expressed in Milliards\r\n                                     of Gold Marks.\r\n\r\n  1. Lord Cunliffe and the figure given\r\n       out in the British General Election\r\n       of 1918[38]                             28.8\r\n\r\n  2. M. Klotz’s forecast in the French\r\n       Chamber, September 5, 1919             18\r\n\r\n  3. The Assessment of the Reparation\r\n       Commission, April 1921                  8.28\r\n\r\n  4. The London Settlement, May 1921           4.6[39]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe estimate of The _Economic Consequences of the Peace_ (1919),\r\nnamely 2 milliards, was nearly contemporaneous with M. Klotz’s figure\r\nof 18 milliards. M. Tardieu recalls that, when the Peace Conference\r\nwas considering whether a definite figure could be inserted in the\r\nTreaty, the lowest figure which the British and French Prime Ministers\r\nwould accept, as a compromise to meet the pressure put upon them by\r\nthe American representatives, corresponded to an annuity of 10.8\r\nmilliards,[40] which is nearly two and a half times the figure which\r\nthey accepted two years later under the pressure, not of Americans, but\r\nof facts.\r\n\r\nThere was yet another feature in the London Settlement which\r\nrecommended it to moderate opinion. The dates of payment were so\r\narranged as to reduce the burden on Germany during the first year. The\r\nReparation year runs from May 1 in each year to April 30 in the next;\r\nbut in the period May 1, 1921–April 30, 1922 only two, instead of four,\r\nof the quarterly payments in respect of the export proportion will fall\r\ndue.\r\n\r\nNo wonder, therefore, that this settlement, so reasonable in itself\r\ncompared with what had preceded it, was generally approved and widely\r\naccepted as a real and permanent solution. But in spite of its\r\nimportance for the time being, as a preservative of peace, as affording\r\na breathing space, and as a transition from foolish expectations, it\r\ncannot be a permanent solution. It is, like all its predecessors, a\r\ntemporizing measure, which is bound to need amendment.\r\n\r\nTo calculate the total burden, it is necessary to estimate the value\r\nof German exports. In 1920 they amounted to about 5 milliard gold\r\nmarks. In 1921 the volume will be greater, but this will be offset by\r\nthe fact that gold prices have fallen to less than two–thirds of what\r\nthey were, so that 4 to 5 milliard gold marks is quite high enough as\r\na preliminary forecast for the year commencing May 1, 1921.[41] It is,\r\nof course, impossible to make a close estimate for later years. The\r\nfigures will depend, not only on the recovery of Germany, but on the\r\nstate of international trade generally, and more especially on the\r\nlevel of gold prices.[42] For the next two or three years, if we are to\r\nmake an estimate at all, 6 to 10 milliards is, in my judgment, the best\r\none can make.\r\n\r\nTwenty–six per cent of exports, valued at 6 milliards gold, will amount\r\nto about 1½ milliard gold marks, making, with the fixed annual\r\npayment of 2 milliards, 3½ milliards altogether. If exports rise to\r\n10 milliards, the corresponding figure is 4½ milliards. The table\r\nof payments in the near future is then as shown on the next page, all\r\nthe figures being in terms of milliards of gold marks. In the case of\r\npayments after May 1, 1922, I give alternative estimates on the basis\r\nof exports on the scale of 6 and 10 milliards respectively.\r\n\r\nNot the whole of these sums need be paid in cash, and the value of\r\ndeliveries in kind is to be credited to Germany against them. This\r\nitem has been estimated as high as 1.2 to 1.4 milliard gold marks per\r\nannum. The result will chiefly depend (1) on the amount and price of\r\nthe coal deliveries, and (2) on the degree of success which attends the\r\nnegotiations between France and Germany for the supply by the latter\r\nof materials required for the repair of the devastated area. The value\r\nof the coal deliveries depends on factors already discussed on p. 49,\r\nabove, the _price_ of the coal being chiefly governed by the internal\r\nGerman price. At a price of 20 gold marks per ton and deliveries of\r\n2,000,000 tons a month (neither of which figures are likely to be\r\nexceeded, or even reached, in the near future), coal will yield credits\r\nof .48 milliard gold marks. In the Loucheur–Rathenau Agreement[43] the\r\nvalue of deliveries in kind to France, including coal, over the next\r\nfive years has been estimated at a possible total of 1.4 milliard gold\r\nmarks per annum. If France receives .4 milliard gold marks in coal, not\r\nmore than 35 per cent of the balance will be credited in the Reparation\r\naccount. If this were realized, the aggregate deliveries in kind might\r\napproach 1 milliard. But, for various reasons, political and economic,\r\nthis figure is unlikely to be reached, and if as much as .75 milliards\r\nper annum is realized from coal and reconstruction deliveries, this\r\nought to be considered a highly satisfactory result.\r\n\r\n  ──────────────┬────────────────┬────────────────┬───────────────\r\n                │     1921─22    │  1922─23 and   │  1922─23 and\r\n                │    (Exports    │  subsequently  │  subsequently\r\n                │  4 Milliards). │    (Exports    │    (Exports\r\n                │                │  6 Milliards). │ 10 Milliards).\r\n  ──────────────┼────────────────┼────────────────┼───────────────\r\n  May 25       }│                │       .39      │       .65\r\n  July 15      }│                │       .50      │       .50\r\n  Aug. 15      }│      1.00      │       .39      │       .65\r\n  Oct. 15      }│                │       .50      │       .50\r\n  Nov. 15       │       .26      │       .39      │       .65\r\n  Jan. 15       │       .50      │       .50      │       .50\r\n  Feb. 15       │       .26      │       .39      │       .65\r\n  April 15      │       .50      │       .50      │       .50\r\n                │      ────      │      ────      │      ────\r\n        Total   │      2.52      │      3.56      │      4.60\r\n  ──────────────┼────────────────┼────────────────┼───────────────\r\n  Equivalent   }│                │                │\r\n    in dollars }│                │                │\r\n    at $1 = 4  }│  $630,000,000  │  $890,000,000  │ $1,150,000,000\r\n    gold marks }│                │                │\r\n  ──────────────┴────────────────┴────────────────┴───────────────\r\n\r\nNow the payments were so arranged as to present no insuperable\r\ndifficulties during 1921. The instalment of August 31, 1921 (which\r\ndid not exceed the sum which the Germans had themselves offered for\r\nimmediate payment in their counterproposal of April 1921) was duly\r\npaid, partly out of foreign balances accumulated before May 1 last,\r\npartly by selling out paper marks over the foreign exchanges, and\r\npartly by temporary advances from an international group of bankers.\r\nThe instalment of November 15,1921, was covered by the value of\r\ndeliveries of coal and other material subsequent to May 1, 1921. Even\r\nthe instalments of January 15 and February 15, 1922, might be covered\r\nout of further deliveries, temporary advances, and the foreign assets\r\nof German industrialists, if the German Government could get hold of\r\nthem. But the payment of April 15, 1922, must present more difficulty;\r\nwhilst further instalments follow quickly on May 15, July 15, and\r\nAugust 15. Some time between February and August 1922 Germany will\r\nsuccumb to an inevitable default. This is the maximum extent of our\r\nbreathing space.[44]\r\n\r\nThat is to say, in so far as she depends for payment (as in the\r\nlong run she must do) on current income. If capital, non–recurrent\r\nresources become available, the above conclusion will require\r\nmodification accordingly. Germany still has an important capital asset\r\nuntouched—the property of her nationals now sequestered in the hands\r\nof the Enemy–Property Custodian in the United States, of which the\r\nvalue is rather more than 1 milliard gold marks. If this were to become\r\navailable for Reparation, directly or indirectly, default could be\r\ndelayed correspondingly.[45] Similarly the grant to Germany of foreign\r\ncredits on a substantial scale, even three–months’ credits from bankers\r\non the security of the Reichsbank’s gold, would postpone the date a\r\nlittle, however useless in the long run.\r\n\r\nIn reaching this conclusion, one can approach the problem from three\r\npoints of view: (1) the problem of paying outside Germany, that is\r\nto say, the problem of exports and the balance of trade; (2) the\r\nproblem of providing for payment by taxation, that is to say, the\r\nproblem of the Budget; (3) the proportion of the sums demanded to the\r\nGerman national income. I will take them in turn, confining myself to\r\nwhat Germany can be expected to perform in the near future, to the\r\nexclusion of what she might do in hypothetical circumstances many\r\nyears hence.\r\n\r\n(1) In order that Germany may be able to make payments abroad, it is\r\nnecessary, not only that she should have exports, but that she should\r\nhave a surplus of exports over imports. In 1920, the last complete\r\nyear for which figures are available, so far from a surplus there was\r\na deficit, the exports being valued at about 5 milliard gold marks and\r\nthe imports at 5.4 milliards. The figures for 1921 so far available\r\nindicate not an improvement but a deterioration. The myth that Germany\r\nis carrying on a vast and increasing export trade is so widespread,\r\nthat the actual figures for the six months from May to October 1921,\r\nconverted into gold marks, may be given with advantage:\r\n\r\n  ─–──────────────────┬─────────────────┬──────────────────────────\r\n                      │   Million Paper │  Million Gold Marks.[46]\r\n                      │       Marks.    │\r\n                      ├────────┬────────┼────────┬────────┬────────\r\n                      │        │        │        │        │Excess\r\n                      │Imports.│Exports.│Imports.│Exports.│  of\r\n                      │        │        │        │        │Imports.\r\n  ────────────────────┼────────┼────────┼────────┼────────┼────────\r\n  1921, May           │   5,487│   4,512│   374.4│   307.9│    66.5\r\n    ”   June          │   6,409│   5,433│   388.8│   329.7│    59.1\r\n    ”   July          │   7,580│   6,208│   413.7│   338.7│    75.0\r\n    ”   August        │   9,418│   6,684│   477.2│   334.8│   142.4\r\n    ”   September     │  10,668│   7,519│   436.6│   307.7│   128.9\r\n    ”   October[47]   │  13,900│   9,700│   352.6│   246.0│   106.6\r\n                      ├────────┼────────┼────────┼────────┼────────\r\n  Total for six months│  53,462│  40,056│  2443.3│  1864.8│   578.5\r\n  ────────────────────┴────────┴────────┴────────┴────────┴────────\r\n\r\nIn respect of these six months Germany must make a fixed payment of\r\n1000 million gold marks plus 26 per cent of the exports as above,\r\nnamely 484.8 million gold marks, that is 1484.8 million gold marks\r\naltogether, which is equal to about 80 per cent of her exports; whereas\r\napart from any Reparation payments, she had a _deficit_ on her foreign\r\ntrade at the rate of more than 1 milliard gold marks per annum. The\r\nbulk of Germany’s imports are necessary either to her industries or\r\nto the food supply of the country. It is therefore certain that with\r\nexports of (say) 6 milliards she could not cut her imports so low as to\r\nhave the surplus of 3½ milliards, which would be necessary to meet\r\nher Reparation liabilities. If, however, her exports were to rise to\r\n10 milliards, her Reparation liabilities would become 4.6 milliards.\r\nGermany, to meet her liabilities, must therefore raise the gold–value\r\nof her exports to double what they were in 1920 and 1921 _without\r\nincreasing her imports at all_.\r\n\r\nI do not say that this is impossible, given time and an overwhelming\r\nmotive, and with active assistance by the Allies to Germany’s export\r\nindustries; but does any one think it practicable or likely in the\r\nactual circumstances of the case? And if Germany succeeded, would not\r\nthis vast expansion of exports, unbalanced by imports, be considered\r\nby our manufacturers to be her crowning crime? That this should be\r\nthe case even under the London Settlement of 1921 is a measure of\r\nthe ludicrous folly of the figures given out in the British General\r\nElection of 1918, which were six times as high again.\r\n\r\n(2) Next there is the problem of the Budget. For Reparation payments\r\nare a liability of the German _Government_ and must be covered by\r\ntaxation. At this point it is necessary to introduce an assumption as\r\nto the relation between the gold mark and the paper mark. For whilst\r\nthe liability is fixed in terms of gold marks, the revenue (or the\r\nbulk of it) is collected in terms of paper marks. The relation is a\r\nvery fluctuating one, best measured by the exchange value of the paper\r\nmark in terms of American gold dollars. This fluctuation is of more\r\nimportance over short periods than in the long run. For in the long run\r\n_all_ values in Germany, including the yield of taxation, will tend\r\nto adjust themselves to an appreciation or depreciation in the value\r\nof the paper mark outside Germany. But the process may be a very slow\r\none, and, over the period covered by a year’s budget, unanticipated\r\nfluctuations in the ratio of the gold to the paper mark may upset\r\nentirely the financial arrangements of the German Treasury.\r\n\r\nThis disturbance has of course occurred on an unprecedented scale\r\nduring the latter half of 1921. Taxation in terms of paper marks,\r\nwhich was heavy when the dollar was worth 50 paper marks, becomes\r\nvery inadequate when the dollar is worth 200 paper marks; but it is\r\nbeyond the power of any Finance Minister to adjust taxation to such a\r\nsituation quickly. In the first place, when the fall in the external\r\nvalue of the mark is proceeding rapidly, the corresponding fall in the\r\ninternal value lags far behind. Until this adjustment has taken place,\r\nwhich may occupy a considerable time before it is complete, the taxable\r\ncapacity of the people, measured in gold, is less than it was before.\r\nBut even then a further interval must elapse before the gold–value of\r\nthe _yield_ of taxation collectible in paper marks can catch up. The\r\nexperience of the British Inland Revenue Department well shows that the\r\nyield of direct taxation must largely depend on the taxable assessments\r\nof the _previous_ period.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons the collapse of the mark exchange must, if it\r\npersists, destroy beyond repair the Budget of 1921–22, and probably\r\nthat of the first half of 1922–23 also. But I should be overstating my\r\nargument if I were to base my conclusions on the figures current at the\r\nend of 1921. In the shifting sands in which the mark is foundering it\r\nis difficult to find for one’s argument any secure foothold.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1921 the gold mark was worth, in round figures,\r\n20 paper marks. The internal purchasing power of the paper mark for\r\nthe purposes of working–class consumption was still nearly double\r\nits corresponding value abroad, so that one could scarcely say that\r\nequilibrium had been established. Nevertheless, the position was very\r\nwell adjusted compared with what it has since become. As I write\r\n(December 1921) the gold mark has been fluctuating between 45 and\r\n60 paper marks, while the purchasing power of the paper mark inside\r\nGermany is for general purposes perhaps three times what it is outside\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nSince my figures of Government revenue and expenditure are based on\r\nstatements made in the summer of 1921, perhaps my best course is to\r\ntake a figure of 20 paper marks to the gold mark. The effect of this\r\nwill be to understate my argument rather than the contrary. The reader\r\nmust remember that, if the mark remains at its present exchange value\r\nlong enough for internal values to adjust themselves to that rate, the\r\nitems in the following account, the income and the outgoings and the\r\ndeficit, will all tend to be multiplied threefold.\r\n\r\nAt this ratio (of 20 paper marks=1 gold mark), a Reparation liability\r\nof 3½ milliard gold marks (assuming exports on the scale of 6\r\nmilliards) is equivalent to 70 milliard paper marks, and a liability\r\nof 4½ milliards (assuming exports of 10 milliards) is equivalent\r\nto 90 milliard paper marks. The German Budget for the financial year\r\nApril 1, 1921, to March 31, 1922, provided for an expenditure of\r\n93.5 milliards, exclusive of Reparation payments, and for a revenue\r\nof 59 milliards.[48] Thus the present Reparation demand would by\r\nitself absorb more than the whole of the existing revenue. Doubtless\r\nexpenditure can be cut down, and revenue somewhat increased. But the\r\nBudget will not cover even the lower scale of the Reparation payments\r\nunless expenditure is halved and revenue doubled.[49]\r\n\r\nIf the German Budget for 1922–23 manages to balance, _apart_ from any\r\nprovision for Reparation, this will represent a great effort and a\r\nconsiderable achievement. Apart, however, from the technical financial\r\ndifficulties, there is a political and social aspect of the question\r\nwhich deserves attention here. The Allies deal with the established\r\nGerman Government, make bargains with them, and look to them for\r\nfulfilment. The Allies do not extract payment out of individual\r\nGermans direct; they put pressure on the transitory abstraction called\r\nGovernment, and leave it to this to determine and to enforce which\r\nindividuals are to pay, and how much. Since at the present time the\r\nGerman Budget is far from balancing even if there were no Reparation\r\npayments at all, it is fair to say that not even a beginning has yet\r\nbeen made towards settling the problem of how the burden is to be\r\ndistributed between different classes and different interests.\r\n\r\nYet this problem is fundamental. Payment takes on a different aspect\r\nwhen, instead of being expressed in terms of milliards and as a\r\nliability of the transitory abstraction, it is translated into a\r\ndemand for a definite sum from a specific individual. This stage is not\r\nyet reached, and until it is reached the full intrinsic difficulty will\r\nnot be felt. For at this stage the struggle ceases to be primarily one\r\nbetween the Allies and the German Government and becomes a struggle\r\nbetween different sections and classes of Germans. The struggle will\r\nbe bitter and violent, for it will present itself to each of the\r\ncontesting interests as an affair of life and death. The most powerful\r\ninfluences and motives of self–interest and self–preservation will be\r\nengaged. Conflicting conceptions of the end and nature of Society will\r\nbe ranged in conflict. A Government which makes a serious attempt to\r\ncover its liabilities will inevitably fall from power.\r\n\r\n(3) What relation do the demands bear to the third test of capacity,\r\nthe present income of the German people? A burden of 70 milliard paper\r\nmarks (if we may, provisionally, adopt that figure as the basis of our\r\ncalculations) amounts, since the population is now about 60 millions,\r\nto 1170 marks per head for every man, woman, and child.\r\n\r\nThe great changes in money values have made it difficult, in all\r\ncountries, to obtain estimates of the national income in terms of money\r\nunder the new conditions. The Brussels Conference of 1920, on the basis\r\nof inquiries made in 1919 and at the beginning of 1920, estimated the\r\nGerman income per head at 3900 paper marks. This figure may have\r\nbeen too low at the time, and, on account of the further depreciation\r\nof the mark, is certainly too low now. A writer in the _Deutsche\r\nAllgemeine Zeitung_ (Feb. 14, 1921), working on the statistics of\r\nstatutory deductions from wages and on income–tax, arrived at a figure\r\nof 2333 marks per head. This figure also is likely to be too low,\r\npartly because the statistics must mainly refer to earlier dates when\r\nthe mark was less depreciated, and partly because all such statistics\r\nnecessarily suffer from evasions. At the other extreme lies the\r\nestimate of Dr. Albert Lansburgh, who, by implication (_Die Bank_,\r\nMarch 1921), estimated the income per head at 6570 marks.[50] Another\r\nrecent estimate is that of Dr. Arthur Heichen in the _Pester Lloyd_\r\n(June 5, 1921), who put the figure at 4450 marks. In a newspaper\r\narticle published in various quarters in August 1921 I ventured to\r\nadopt the figure of 5000 marks as the nearest estimate I could make.\r\nIn fixing on this figure I was influenced by the above estimates, and\r\nalso by statistics as to the general level of salaries and wages. Since\r\nthen I have looked into the matter further and am still of the opinion\r\nthat this figure was high enough for that date.\r\n\r\nI am fortified in this conclusion by the result of inquiries which I\r\naddressed to Dr. Moritz Elsas of Frankfort–on–Main, on whose authority\r\nI quote the following figures. The best–known estimate of the German\r\npre–war income is Helfferich’s in his _Deutschlands Volkswohlstand_\r\n1888–1913. In this volume he put the national income in 1913 at 40–41\r\nmilliard gold marks, _plus_ 2½ milliards for net income from\r\nnationalized concerns (railways, post office, etc.), that it is say,\r\nan aggregate of 43 milliards or 642 marks per head. Starting from the\r\nfigure of 41 milliards (since the national services no longer produce\r\na profit) and deducting 15 per cent for loss of territory, we have a\r\nfigure of 34.85 milliards. What multiplier ought we to apply to this in\r\norder to arrive at the present income in terms of paper marks? In 1920\r\ncommercial employees obtained on the average in terms of marks 4½\r\ntimes their pre–war income, whilst at that time workmen had secured an\r\nincrease in their nominal wages of 50 per cent more than this, that is\r\nto say, their wages were 6 to 8 times the pre–war figure. According\r\nto the Statistischen Reichsamt (_Wirtschaft und Statistik_, Heft 4,\r\nJahrgang 1) commercial employees at the beginning of 1921 earned,\r\nmales 6⅔ times and females 10 times as much as in 1913.[51] On the\r\nbasis of the same proportion as in 1920 we arrive at an increase of\r\n10 times in the nominal wages of workmen. The wages index number of\r\nthe _Frankfurter Zeitung_ for August 1921 estimates the wages per hour\r\nat 11 times the pre–war level, but, as the number of working hours\r\nhas fallen from 10 to 8, these figures yield an increase of 8.8 times\r\nin the wage actually received. Since the wages of male commercial\r\nemployees have increased less than this, since business profits in\r\nterms of paper marks only reach this figure of increase in exceptional\r\ncases, and since the income of the rentier, landlord, and professional\r\nclasses has increased in a far lower proportion, an estimate of an\r\n8–fold increase in the nominal income of the country as a whole at\r\nthat date (August 1921) is likely to be an over–estimate rather than\r\nan under–estimate. This leads to an aggregate national income, on the\r\nbasis of the Helfferich pre–war figures, of 278.80 milliard paper\r\nmarks, and to an income of 4647 marks per head in August 1921.\r\n\r\nNo allowance is made here for the loss by war of men in the prime\r\nof life, for the loss of external income previously earned from\r\nforeign investment and the mercantile marine, or for the increase of\r\nofficials. Against these omissions there may be set off the decrease of\r\nthe army and the increased number of women employees.\r\n\r\nThe extreme instability of economic conditions makes it almost\r\nimpossible to conduct a direct statistical inquiry into this problem\r\nat the present time. In such circumstances the general method of Dr.\r\nElsas seems to me to be the best available. His results show that the\r\nfigure taken above is of the right general dimensions and is not likely\r\nto be widely erroneous. It enables us, too, to put an upper limit of\r\nreasonable possibility on our figures. No one, I think, would maintain\r\nthat in August 1921 nominal incomes in Germany averaged 10 times their\r\npre–war level; and 10 times Helfferich’s pre–war estimate comes to\r\n6420 marks. _No_ statistics of national incomes are very precise, but\r\nan assertion that in the middle of 1921 the German income per head per\r\nannum lay between 4500 marks and 6500 marks, and that it was probably\r\nmuch nearer the lower than the higher of these figures, say 5000 marks,\r\nis about as near the truth as we shall get.\r\n\r\nIn view of the instability of the mark, it is, of course, the case\r\nthat such estimates do not hold good for any length of time and need\r\nconstant revision. Nevertheless this fact does not upset the following\r\ncalculation as much as might be supposed, because it operates to a\r\ncertain extent on both sides of the account. If the mark depreciates\r\nfurther, the average income per head in paper marks will tend to rise;\r\nbut in this event the equivalent in paper marks of the Reparation\r\nliability will, since it is expressed in terms of _gold_ marks, rise\r\nalso. A real alleviation can only result from a fall in the value of\r\n_gold_ (_i.e._, a rise in world prices).\r\n\r\nTo the taxation in respect of the Reparation charge there must be added\r\nthe burden of Germany’s own government, central and local. By the most\r\nextreme economies, short of repudiation of war loans and war pensions,\r\nthis burden could hardly be brought below 1000 paper marks per head (at\r\n20 paper marks=1 gold mark), _i.e._, 60 milliards altogether, a figure\r\ngreatly below the present expenditure. In the aggregate, therefore,\r\n2170 marks out of the average income of 5000 marks, or 43 per cent,\r\nwould go in taxation. If exports rise to 10 milliards (gold) and the\r\naverage income to 6000 paper marks, the corresponding figures are 2500\r\nmarks and 42 per cent.\r\n\r\nThere are circumstances in which a wealthy nation, impelled by\r\noverwhelming motives of self–interest, might support this burden.\r\nBut the annual income of 5000 paper marks per head is equivalent in\r\nexchange value (at an exchange of 20 paper marks to 1 gold mark) to\r\n$62.50, and after deduction of taxation to about $35, that is to say\r\nto less than 10 cents a day, which in August 1921 was the equivalent\r\nin purchasing power in Germany of something between 20 cents and 25\r\ncents in the United States.[52] If Germany was given a respite, her\r\nincome and with it her capacity would increase; but under her present\r\nburdens, which render saving impossible, a degradation of standards is\r\nmore likely. Would the whips and scorpions of any Government recorded\r\nin history have been efficient to extract nearly half their income from\r\na people so situated?\r\n\r\nFor these reasons I conclude that whilst the Settlement of London\r\ngranted a breathing space to the end of 1921, it can be no more\r\npermanent than its predecessors.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             EXCURSUS III\r\n\r\n                        THE WIESBADEN AGREEMENT\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1921 much interest was excited by reports of\r\nconfidential interviews between M. Loucheur and Herr Rathenau, the\r\nMinisters of Reconstruction in France and Germany respectively. An\r\nagreement was provisionally reached in August 1921 and was finally\r\nsigned at Wiesbaden on October 6, 1921[53]; but it does not come into\r\nforce until it has received the approval of the Reparation Commission.\r\nThis Commission, whilst approving the general principles underlying it,\r\nhave referred it to the principal Allied Governments on the ground that\r\nit involves departures from the Treaty of Versailles beyond their own\r\ncompetence to authorize. The British delegate, Sir John Bradbury, has\r\nadvised his Government that the Agreement should be approved subject\r\nto certain modifications which he sets forth; and his Report has been\r\npublished.[54]\r\n\r\nThe Wiesbaden Agreement is a complicated document. But the essence of\r\nit is easily explained. It falls into two distinct parts. First, it\r\nsets up a procedure by which private French firms can acquire from\r\nprivate German firms materials required for reconstruction in France,\r\nwithout France having to make payment in cash. Secondly, it provides\r\nthat, whilst Germany is not to receive payment at once for any part\r\nof these goods, only a proportion of the sum due is credited to her\r\nimmediately in the books of the Reparation Commission, the balance\r\nbeing advanced by her to France for the time being and only brought\r\ninto the Reparation account at a later date.\r\n\r\nThe first set of provisions has met with unqualified approval from\r\nevery one. An arrangement which may possibly stimulate payment of\r\nReparation in the form of actual materials for the reconstruction\r\nof the devastated districts satisfies convenience, economics, and\r\nsentiment in a peculiarly direct way. But such supplies were already\r\narranged for under the Treaty, and the chief value of the new procedure\r\nlies in its replacing the machinery of the Reparation Commission by\r\ndirect negotiation between the French and German authorities.[55]\r\n\r\nThe second set of provisions is, however, of a different character,\r\nsince it interferes with the existing agreements between the Allies\r\nthemselves as to the order and proportions in which each is to share\r\nin the available receipts from Germany, and seeks to secure for\r\nFrance a larger share of the earlier payments than she would receive\r\notherwise. A priority to France is, in my opinion, desirable; but such\r\npriority should be accorded as part of a general re–settlement of\r\nReparation, in which Great Britain should waive her claim entirely.\r\nFurther, the Agreement involves an act of doubtful good faith on the\r\npart of Germany. She has been protesting with great vehemence (and, I\r\nbelieve, with perfect truth) that the Decisions of London exact from\r\nher more than she can perform. But in such circumstances it is an act\r\nof impropriety for her to enter voluntarily into an agreement which\r\nmust have the effect, if it is operative, of further increasing her\r\nliabilities even beyond those against which she protests as impossible.\r\nHerr Rathenau may justify his action by the arguments that this is a\r\nfirst step towards replacing the Decisions of London by more sensible\r\narrangements, and also that, if he can placate Germany’s largest and\r\nmost urgent creditor in the shape of France, he has not much to fear\r\nfrom the others. M. Loucheur, on the other hand, may know as well as I\r\ndo, though speaking otherwise, that the Decisions of London cannot be\r\ncarried out, and that the time for a more realistic policy is at hand;\r\nhe may even regard his interviews with Herr Rathenau as a foretaste of\r\nmore intimate relationships between business interests on the two sides\r\nof the Rhine. But these considerations, if we were to pursue them,\r\nwould lead us to a different plane of argument.\r\n\r\nSir John Bradbury in his Report[56] on the Agreement to the British\r\nGovernment has proposed certain modifications which would have the\r\neffect of preserving the advantages of the first set of provisions,\r\nbut of nullifying the latter so far as they could operate to the\r\ndetriment of France’s Allies.\r\n\r\nI consider, however, that exaggerated importance has been attached\r\nto this topic, since the actual deliveries of goods made under the\r\nWiesbaden or similar agreements are not likely to be worth such large\r\nsums of money as are spoken of. Deliveries of coal, dyestuffs, and\r\nships, dealt with in the Annexes to Part VIII. of the Treaty are\r\nspecifically excluded from the operation of the Wiesbaden Agreement\r\nwhich is expressly limited to deliveries of plant and material, and\r\nthese France undertakes to apply _solely_ to the reconstitution of the\r\ndevastated regions. The quantities of goods, which French firms and\r\nindividuals will be ready to order from Germany at the full market\r\nprice, and which Germany can supply, for this limited purpose (so great\r\na part of the cost of which is necessarily due to _labor_ employed on\r\nthe spot and not to materials capable of being imported from Germany),\r\nare not likely to amount, during the next five years, to a sum of money\r\nwhich the other Allies need grudge France as a priority claim.\r\n\r\nMy other reserve relates to the supposed importance of the Wiesbaden\r\nAgreement as a precedent for similar arrangements with the other\r\nAllies, and raises the general issue of the utility of arrangements for\r\nsecuring that Germany should pay in kind rather than in cash, for other\r\npurposes than those of the devastated areas.\r\n\r\nIt is commonly believed that, if our demands on Germany are met by\r\nher delivering to us not cash but particular commodities selected by\r\nourselves, we can thus avoid the competition of German products against\r\nour own in the markets of the world, which must result if we compel her\r\nto find foreign currency by selling goods abroad at whatever cut in\r\nprice may be necessary to market them.[57]\r\n\r\nMost suggestions in favor of our being paid in kind are too vague to\r\nbe criticized. But they usually suffer from the confusion of supposing\r\nthat there is some advantage in our being paid directly in kind even in\r\nthe case of articles which Germany might be expected to export in any\r\ncase. For example, the Annexes to the Treaty which deal with deliveries\r\nin kind chiefly relate to coal, dyestuffs, and ships. These certainly\r\ndo not satisfy the criterion of not competing with our own products;\r\nand I see very little advantage, but on the other hand some loss and\r\ninconvenience, in the Allies’ receiving these goods direct, instead of\r\nGermany’s selling them in the best market and paying over the proceeds.\r\nIn the case of coal in particular, it would be much better if Germany\r\nsold her output for cash in the best export markets, whether to France\r\nand Belgium or to the neighboring neutrals, and then paid the cash\r\nover to France and Belgium, than that coal should be delivered to the\r\nAllies for which the latter may have no immediate use, or by transport\r\nroutes which are uneconomical, when neutrals need the coal and what the\r\nAllies really require is the equivalent cash. In some cases the Allies\r\nhave re–sold the coal which Germany has delivered to them,—a procedure\r\nwhich, in the case of an article for which freight charges cover so\r\nlarge a proportion of the whole value, involves a preposterous waste.\r\n\r\nIf we try to stipulate the precise commodities in which Germany is to\r\npay us, we shall not secure from her so large a contribution, as if\r\nwe fix a reasonable sum which is within her capacity, and then leave\r\nher to find the money as best she can. If, moreover, the sum fixed is\r\nreasonable, the annual payments will not be so large, in proportion to\r\nthe total volume of international trade, that Great Britain need be\r\nnervous lest the payments upset the normal equilibrium of her economic\r\nlife in any greater degree than is bound to result in any case from the\r\ngradual economic recovery of so formidable a trade rival as pre–war\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nWhilst I make these observations in the interests of scientific\r\naccuracy, I admit that projects, for insisting on payment in kind may\r\nbe very useful politically as a means of escaping out of our present\r\n_impasse_. In practice the value of such deliveries would turn out to\r\nbe immensely less than the cash we are now demanding; but it may be\r\neasier to substitute deliveries of materials in place of cash, which\r\nwill in practice result in a great abatement of our demands, than to\r\nabate the latter in so many words. Moreover, protests, against leaving\r\nGermany free to pay us in cash by selling goods how and where she can,\r\nenlist on the side of revision all the latent Protectionist sentiment\r\nwhich still abounds. If Germany were to make a strenuous effort to\r\npay us by exploiting the only method open to her, namely, by selling\r\nas many goods as possible at low prices all over the world, it would\r\nnot be long before many minds would represent this effort as a plot to\r\nruin us; and persons of this way of thinking will be most easily won\r\nover, if we describe a reduction in our demands, as a prohibition to\r\nGermany against developing a nefarious competitive trade. Such a way\r\nof expressing a desirable change of policy combines, with a basis of\r\ntruth, sufficient false doctrine to enable _The Times_, for example,\r\nto recommend it in a leading article without feeling conscious of any\r\nintellectual inconsistency; and it furnishes what so many people are\r\nnow looking for, namely, a pretext for behaving sensibly, without\r\nhaving to suffer the indignity and inconvenience of thinking and\r\nspeaking so too. Heaven forbid that I should discourage them! It\r\nis only too rarely that a good cause can summon to its assistance\r\narguments sufficiently mixed to insure success.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              EXCURSUS IV\r\n\r\n                           THE MARK EXCHANGE\r\n\r\nThe gold value of a country’s inconvertible paper money may fall,\r\neither because the Government is spending more than it is raising by\r\nloans and taxes and is meeting the balance by issuing paper money,\r\nor because the country is under the obligation of paying increased\r\nsums to foreigners for the purchase of investments or in discharge of\r\ndebts. Temporarily it may be affected by speculation, that is to say by\r\n_anticipation_, whether well or ill founded, that one or other of the\r\nabove influences will operate shortly; but the influence of speculation\r\nis generally much exaggerated, because of the immense effect which it\r\nmay exercise momentarily. Both influences can only operate through\r\nthe balance of debts, due for immediate payment, between the country\r\nin question and the rest of the world: the liability to make payments\r\nto foreigners operating on this directly; and the inflation of the\r\ncurrency operating on it indirectly, either because the additional\r\npaper money stimulates imports and retards exports, by increasing\r\nlocal purchasing power at the existing level of values or because the\r\nexpectation that it will so act causes anticipatory speculation. The\r\nexpansion of the currency can have no effect whatever on the exchanges\r\nuntil it reacts on imports and exports, or encourages speculation; and\r\nas the latter cancels out, sooner or later, the effect of currency\r\nexpansion on the exchanges can only last by reacting on imports and\r\nexports.\r\n\r\nThese principles can be applied without difficulty to the exchange\r\nvalue of the mark since 1920. At first the various influences were\r\nnot all operating in the same direction. Currency inflation tended\r\nto depreciate the mark; so did foreign investment by Germans (the\r\n“flight from the mark”); but investment by foreigners in German Bonds\r\nand German currency (an exact line between which and short–period\r\nspeculation it is not easy to draw) operated sharply in the other\r\ndirection. After the mark had fallen to such a level that more than\r\n25 marks could be obtained for a dollar, numerous persons all over\r\nthe world formed the opinion that there would be a reaction some day\r\nto the pre–war value, and that therefore a purchase of marks or mark\r\nBonds would be a good investment. This investment proceeded on so vast\r\na scale that it placed foreign currency at the disposal of Germany up\r\nto an aggregate value which has been estimated at from $800,000,000\r\nto $1,000,000,000. These resources enabled Germany, partially at\r\nleast, to replenish her food supplies and to restock her industries\r\nwith raw materials, requirements involving an excess of imports over\r\nexports which could not otherwise have been paid for. In addition it\r\neven enabled individual Germans to remove a part of their wealth from\r\nGermany for investment in other countries.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile currency inflation was proceeding. In the course of the year\r\n1920 the note circulation of the Reichsbank approximately doubled,\r\nwhilst on balance the exchange value of the mark had deteriorated only\r\nslightly as compared with the beginning of that year.\r\n\r\nMoreover, up to the end of 1920 and even during the first quarter of\r\n1921 Germany had made no cash payments for Reparation and had even\r\n_received_ cash (under the Spa Agreement) for a considerable part of\r\nher coal deliveries.\r\n\r\nAfter the middle of 1921, however, the various influences, which up\r\nto that time had partly balanced one another, began to work all in\r\none direction, that is to say, adversely to the value of the mark.\r\nCurrency inflation continued, and during 1921 the note circulation of\r\nthe Reichsbank was nearly trebled, bringing it up to nearly six times\r\nwhat it had been two years earlier. Imports steadily exceeded exports\r\nin value. Some foreign investors in marks began to take fright and,\r\nso far from increasing their holdings, sought to diminish them. And\r\nnow at last the German Government was called on to make important cash\r\npayments on Reparation account. Sales of marks from Germany, instead of\r\nbeing absorbed by foreign investors, had now to be made in competition\r\nwith sales from these same investors. Naturally the mark collapsed. It\r\nhad to fall to a value at which new buyers would come forward or at\r\nwhich sellers would hold off.[58]\r\n\r\nThere is no mystery here, nothing but what is easily explained. The\r\ncredence attached to stories of a “German plot” to depreciate the mark\r\nwilfully is further evidence of the overwhelming popular ignorance of\r\nthe influences governing the exchanges, an ignorance already displayed,\r\nto the great pecuniary advantage of Germany, by the international craze\r\nto purchase mark notes.\r\n\r\nIn its later stages the collapse has been mainly due to the necessity\r\nof paying money abroad in discharge of Reparation and in repaying\r\nforeign investors in marks, with the result that the fall in the\r\nexternal value of the mark has outstripped any figure which could be\r\njustified merely as a consequence of the present degree of currency\r\ninflation. Germany would require a much larger note issue than at\r\npresent, if German internal prices were to become adjusted to gold\r\nprices at an exchange of more than 400 marks to the dollar.[1] If,\r\ntherefore, the other influences were to be removed, if, that is to\r\nsay, the Reparation demands were revised and foreign investors were to\r\ntake heart again, a sharp recovery might occur. On the other hand, a\r\nserious attempt by Germany to meet the Reparation demands would cause\r\nthe expenditure of her Government to exceed its income by so great an\r\namount, that currency inflation and the internal price level would\r\ncatch up in due course the external depreciation in the mark.\r\n\r\nIn either event Germany is faced with an unfortunate prospect. If the\r\npresent exchange depreciation persists and the internal price level\r\nbecomes adjusted to it, the resulting redistribution of wealth between\r\ndifferent classes of the community will amount to a social catastrophe.\r\nIf, on the other hand, there is a recovery in the exchange, the\r\ncessation of the existing artificial stimulus to industry and of the\r\nStock Exchange boom based on the depreciating mark may lead to a\r\nfinancial catastrophe.[59] Those responsible for the financial policy\r\nof Germany have a problem of incomparable difficulty in front of them.\r\nUntil the Reparation liability has been settled reasonably, it is\r\nscarcely worth the while of any one to trouble his head about a problem\r\nwhich is insoluble. When stabilization has become a practicable policy,\r\nthe wisest course will probably be to stabilize at whatever level\r\nprices and trade seem most nearly adjusted to at that date.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[32] The preamble states that the settlement is “in accordance with\r\nArticle 233 of the Treaty of Versailles.” This Article prescribes\r\nthat the scheme of payments shall provide for the discharge of the\r\nliabilities within _thirty_ years, any unpaid balance at the end of\r\nthis period being “postponed” or “handled otherwise.” In the actual\r\nsettlement, however, the initial limitation to thirty years has been\r\nneglected.\r\n\r\n[33] This actual text is printed below in full, Appendix No. 7.\r\n\r\n[34] It is not competent for a single Ally (_e.g._, Portugal) to claim\r\nits share of the Bonds and market them at the best price obtainable.\r\nUnder the Treaty of Versailles Part VIII. Annex II. 13 (_b_) questions\r\nrelating to the marketing of these Bonds can only be settled by\r\n_unanimous_ decision of the Reparation Commission.\r\n\r\n[35] The Committee is to coöpt three representatives of neutrals when a\r\nsufficient proportion of the Bonds to justify their representation has\r\nbeen marketed on neutral Stock Exchanges.\r\n\r\n[36] And it really is an adequate rejoinder to deputies like M.\r\nForgeot. If a partisan or a child wants a silly, harmful thing, it\r\nmay be better to meet him with a silly, harmless thing, than with\r\nexplanations he cannot understand. This is the traditional wisdom of\r\nstatesmen and nursemaids.\r\n\r\n[37] The effect of this provision is discussed in _The Economic\r\nConsequences of the Peace_, pp. 165–167.\r\n\r\n[38] Cf. Baruch, _The Making of the Reparation and Economic Sections of\r\nthe Treaty_, p. 46; and Lamont, _What Really Happened at Paris_, p. 275.\r\n\r\n[39] Assuming exports of 10 milliards, which is double the actual\r\nfigure of 1920.\r\n\r\n[40] _The Truth about the Treaty_, p. 305.\r\n\r\n[41] Exports for the six months May–October 1921 were valued at about\r\n40 milliard paper marks (exclusive, I think, of deliveries of coal\r\nand payments in kind to the Allies), as against imports valued at 53\r\nmilliard paper marks. If the monthly export figures are converted into\r\ngold marks at the average exchange of the month, the exports for the\r\nsix months work out at about 1865 million gold marks, or at the rate of\r\nrather less than 4 milliard gold marks per annum.\r\n\r\n[42] In _The Economic Consequences of the Peace_, p. 203, I expressly\r\npremised that my estimates were based on a value of money not widely\r\ndifferent from that existing at the date at which I wrote. Since then\r\nprices have risen and fallen back again. The same proviso is necessary\r\nin the case of the present estimates. It would have been more practical\r\nif, in fixing Germany’s liability in terms of money for a long period\r\nof years, some provision had been made for adjusting the real burden in\r\naccordance with fluctuations in the value of money during the period of\r\npayment.\r\n\r\n[43] See Excursus III.\r\n\r\n[44] I first published this prediction in August 1921. As this book\r\ngoes to press, the German Government have notified the Reparation\r\nCommission (December 15, 1921) that, having failed in their attempt to\r\nsecure a foreign loan, they cannot find, apart from deliveries in kind,\r\nmore than 150 or 200 million gold marks towards the instalments of\r\nJanuary and February, 1922.\r\n\r\n[45] The United States has the right to retain and liquidate all\r\nproperty, rights, and interests belonging to German nationals and\r\nlying within the territories, colonies, and possessions of the United\r\nStates on January 10, 1920. The proceeds of such liquidation are at\r\nthe disposal of the United States “in accordance with its laws and\r\nregulations,” that is to say, at the disposal of Congress within the\r\nlimitations of the Constitution, and may be applied by them in any of\r\nthe three following ways: (1) the assets in question may be returned to\r\ntheir original German owners; (2) they may be applied to the discharge\r\nof claims by United States nationals with regard to their property,\r\nrights, and interests in German territory, or debts owing to them by\r\nGerman nationals, or to the payment of claims growing out of acts of\r\nthe German Government after the United States entered the war, and also\r\nto the discharge of similar American claims in respect of those of\r\nGermany’s Allies against whom the United States was at war; (3) they\r\nmay be turned over to the Reparation Commission as a credit to Germany\r\nunder this head.\r\n\r\n[46] The rates for conversion of paper marks into gold marks have been\r\ntaken as follows: Number of paper marks per 100 gold marks in May,\r\n1465.5; June, 1647.9; July, 1832; August, 1996.4; September, 2443.2;\r\nOctober, 3942.6\r\n\r\n[47] Provisional figures.\r\n\r\n[48] The ordinary revenue and expenditure were estimated to balance\r\nat 48.48 milliard paper marks. The extraordinary expenditure was\r\nestimated at 59.68 milliards, making a total expenditure of 108.16\r\nmilliards. Included in this, however, were 14.6 milliards for various\r\nReparation items. These are in respect of various pre–May 1, 1921,\r\nitems and do not allow for payments under the London Settlement; but to\r\navoid confusion I have deducted these from the estimate of expenditure\r\nas stated above. The extraordinary revenue was estimated at 10.5\r\nmilliards, making a total revenue of 58.98 milliards.\r\n\r\n[49] I have allowed nothing so far for the costs of the Armies of\r\nOccupation, which, under the letter of the Treaty, Germany is under\r\nobligation to pay in addition to the sums due for Reparation proper.\r\nAs these charges rank in priority ahead of Reparation, and as the\r\nLondon Agreement does not deal with them, I think Germany is liable to\r\nbe called on to pay these as they accrue in addition to the annuities\r\nfixed in the London Settlement. But I am doubtful whether the Allies\r\nintend in fact to demand this. Hitherto the expense of the Armies has\r\nbeen so great as to absorb virtually the whole of the receipts (see\r\nExcursus V. below), having amounted by the middle of 1921 to about\r\n$1,000,000,000. In any case, it is now time that the agreement, signed\r\nat Paris in 1919 by Clemenceau, Lloyd George, and Wilson, should be\r\nbrought into force, to the effect that the sum payable annually by\r\nGermany to cover the cost of occupation shall be limited to 240 million\r\ngold marks as soon as the Allies “are convinced that the conditions\r\nof disarmament by Germany are being satisfactorily fulfilled.” If we\r\nassume that this reduced figure is brought into force, as it ought to\r\nbe, the total burden on Germany for Separation and Occupation comes, on\r\nthe assumption of the lower figure for exports, to 3.8 milliard gold\r\nmarks, that is, to 76 milliard paper marks.\r\n\r\n[50] “This estimate is based on an average wage of about 800 paper\r\nmarks monthly for male, and about 400 paper marks monthly for female,\r\nemployees.” Converting these figures at the rate of 12 paper marks\r\nequal to 1 gold mark, he arrived at an aggregate national income\r\nbetween 30 and 34 milliard gold marks. It is not easy to see how these\r\nwage estimates, even assuming their correctness, can lead to so high an\r\naggregate figure.\r\n\r\n[51] There are twice as many male commercial employees as there are\r\nfemale.\r\n\r\n[52] For a full examination of the purchasing power of the paper mark\r\ninside Germany, see an article by M. Elsas in the _Economic Journal_,\r\nSeptember 1921.\r\n\r\n[53] A summary of this Agreement and other papers relating to it are\r\ngiven in the Appendix No. 8.\r\n\r\n[54] See Appendix No. 8.\r\n\r\n[55] Incidentally the Wiesbaden Agreement sets up a fairer procedure\r\nfor fixing the prices of supplies in kind than that contemplated in\r\nthe Treaty. According to the Treaty the prices are fixed at the sole\r\ndiscretion of the Reparation Commission. In the Wiesbaden Agreement\r\nthis duty is assigned to an Arbitral Commission consisting of a German\r\nrepresentative, a French representative, and an impartial third who are\r\nto fix the prices, broadly speaking, on the basis of price existing in\r\nFrance in each quarterly period subject to this price being not more\r\nthan 5 per cent below the German price.\r\n\r\n[56] See Appendix No. 8.\r\n\r\n[57] I return to the theoretical aspects of this question in Chapter VI.\r\n\r\n[58] Any one, who can fully persuade himself of the unalterable truth\r\nof the proposition that _every day_ the sales of exchange must exactly\r\nequal the purchases, will have gone a long way towards understanding\r\nthe secret of the exchanges.\r\n\r\n[59] Furthermore, every improvement in the value of the mark increases\r\nthe real burden of what Germany owes to foreign holders of marks and\r\nalso the real burden of the Public Debt on the Exchequer. A rate of\r\nexchange exceeding 400 marks to the dollar has at least this advantage\r\nthat it has reduced these two burdens to very moderate dimensions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                          THE REPARATION BILL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Treaty of Versailles specified the classes of damage in respect\r\nof which Germany was to pay Reparation. It made no attempt to assess\r\nthe amount of this damage. This duty was assigned to the Reparation\r\nCommission, who were instructed to notify their assessment to the\r\nGerman Government on or before May 1, 1921.\r\n\r\nAn attempt was made during the Peace Conference to agree to a figure\r\nthere and then for insertion in the Treaty. The American delegates in\r\nparticular favored this course. But an agreement could not be reached.\r\nThere was no reasonable figure which was not seriously inadequate\r\nto popular expectations in France and the British Empire.[60] The\r\nhighest figure to which the Americans would agree, namely, 140 milliard\r\ngold marks, was, as we shall see later, not much above the eventual\r\nassessment of the Reparation Commission; the lowest figure to which\r\nFrance and Great Britain would agree, namely, 180 milliard gold marks,\r\nwas, as it has turned out, much above the amount to which they were\r\nentitled even under their own categories of claim.[61]\r\n\r\nBetween the date of the Treaty and the announcement of its decision\r\nby the Reparation Commission, there was much controversy as to what\r\nthis amount should be. I propose to review some of the details of\r\nthis problem, because, if men are in any way actuated by veracity in\r\ninternational affairs, a just opinion about it is still relevant to the\r\nReparation problem.\r\n\r\nThe main contentions of _The Economic Consequences of the Peace_\r\nwere these: (1) that the claims against Germany which the Allies\r\nwere contemplating were impossible of payment; (2) that the economic\r\nsolidarity of Europe was so close that the attempt to enforce these\r\nclaims might ruin every one; (3) that the money cost of the damage\r\ndone by the enemy in France and Belgium had been exaggerated; (4) that\r\nthe inclusion of pensions and allowances in our claims was a breach of\r\nfaith; and (5) that our legitimate claim against Germany was within her\r\ncapacity to pay.\r\n\r\nI have made some supplementary observations about (1) and (2) in\r\nChapters III. and VI. I deal with (3) here and in Chapter V. with (4).\r\nThese latter are still important. For, whilst time is so dealing with\r\n(1) and (2) that very few people now dispute them, the amount of our\r\nlegitimate claim against Germany has not been brought into so sharp a\r\nfocus by the pressure of events. Yet if my contention about this can\r\nbe substantiated, the world will find it easier to arrange a practical\r\nsettlement. The claims of justice in this connection are generally\r\nthought to be opposed to those of possibility, so that even if the\r\npressure of events drives us reluctantly to admit that the latter must\r\nprevail, the former will rest unsatisfied. If, on the other hand,\r\nrestricting ourselves to the devastations in France and Belgium, we\r\ncan demonstrate that it is within the capacity of Germany to make full\r\nreparation, a harmony of sentiment and action can be established.\r\n\r\nWith this end in view it is necessary that I should take up again,\r\nin the light of the fuller information now available, the statements\r\nwhich I made in _The Economic Consequences of the Peace_ (p. 120) to\r\nthe effect that “the amount of the material damage done in the invaded\r\ndistricts has been the subject of enormous, if natural, exaggeration.”\r\nThese statements have involved me in a charge, with which Frenchmen\r\nas eminent as M. Clemenceau[62] and M. Poincaré have associated\r\nthemselves, that I was actuated not by the truth but by a supposed\r\nhostility to France in speaking thus of the allegations of M. Klotz and\r\nM. Loucheur and some other Frenchmen. But I still urge on France that\r\nher cause may be served by accuracy and the avoidance of overstatement;\r\nthat the damage she has suffered is more likely to be made good if\r\nthe amount is possible than if it is impossible; and that, the more\r\nmoderate her claims are, the more likely she is to win the support of\r\nthe world in securing priority for them. M. Brenier, in particular, has\r\nconducted a widespread propaganda with the object of creating prejudice\r\nagainst my statistics. Yet to add a large number of noughts at the\r\nend of an estimate is not really an indication of nobility of mind.\r\nNor, in the long run, are those persons good advocates of France’s\r\ncause who bring her name into contempt and her sincerity into doubt by\r\nusing figures wildly. We shall never get to work with the restoration\r\nof Europe unless we can bring not only experts, but the public, to\r\nconsider coolly what material damage France has suffered and what\r\nmaterial resources of reparation Germany commands. _The Times_, in a\r\nleading article which accompanied some articles by M. Brenier (December\r\n4, 1920), wrote with an air of noble contempt—“Mr. Keynes treats their\r\nlosses as matter for statistics.” But chaos and poverty will continue\r\nas long as we insist on treating statistics as an emotional barometer\r\nand as a convenient vehicle of sentiment. In the following examination\r\nof figures let us agree that we are employing them to measure facts and\r\nnot as a literary expression of love or hate.\r\n\r\nLeaving on one side for the present the items of pensions and\r\nallowances and loans to Belgium, let us examine the data relating\r\nto the material damage in Northern France. The claims made by the\r\nFrench Government did not vary very much from the spring of 1919, when\r\nthe Peace Conference was sitting, down to the spring of 1921, when\r\nthe Reparation Commission was deciding its assessment, though the\r\nfluctuations in the value of the franc over that period cause some\r\nconfusion. Early in 1919 M. Dubois, speaking on behalf of the Budget\r\nCommission of the Chamber, gave the figure of 65 milliard francs “as a\r\nminimum,” and on February 17, 1919, M. Loucheur, speaking before the\r\nSenate as Minister of Industrial Reconstruction, estimated the cost at\r\n75 milliards at the prices then prevailing. On September 5, 1919, M.\r\nKlotz, addressing the Chamber as Minister of Finance, put the total\r\nFrench claims for damage to property (presumably inclusive of losses\r\nat sea, etc.) at 134 milliards. In July 1920 M. Dubois, by that time\r\nPresident of the Reparation Commission, in a Report for the Brussels\r\nand Spa Conferences, put the figure at 62 milliards on the basis of\r\npre–war prices.[63] In January 1921 M. Doumer, speaking as Finance\r\nMinister, put the figure at 110 milliards. The actual claim which the\r\nFrench Government submitted to the Reparation Commission in April 1921\r\nwas for 127 milliard paper francs at current prices.[64] By that time\r\nthe exchange value of the franc, and also its purchasing power, had\r\nconsiderably depreciated, and, allowing for this, there is not so great\r\na discrepancy as appears at first sight between the above estimates.\r\n\r\nFor the assessment of the Reparation Commission it was necessary to\r\nconvert this claim from paper francs into gold marks. The rate to be\r\nadopted for this purpose was the subject of acute controversy. On the\r\nbasis of the actual rate of exchange prevailing at that date (April\r\n1921) the gold mark was worth about 3.25 paper francs. The French\r\nrepresentatives claimed that this depreciation was temporary and\r\nthat a permanent settlement ought not to be based on it. They asked,\r\ntherefore, for a rate of about frs. 1.50 or frs. 1.75 to the gold\r\nmark.[65] The question was eventually submitted to the arbitration of\r\nMr. Boyden, the American member of the Reparation Commission, who,\r\nlike most arbitrators, took a middle course and decided that 2.20\r\npaper francs should be deemed equivalent to 1 gold mark.[66] He would\r\nprobably have found it difficult to give a reason for this decision.\r\nAs regards that part of the claim which was in respect of pensions, a\r\nforecast of the gold value of the franc, however impracticable, was\r\nrelevant. But as regards that part which was in respect of material\r\ndamage, no such adjustment was necessary[67]; for the French claim had\r\nbeen drawn up on the basis of the current costs of reconstruction, the\r\ngold equivalent of which need not be expected to rise with an increase\r\nin the gold value of the franc, an improvement in the exchange being\r\nbalanced sooner or later by a fall in franc prices. It might have been\r\nproper to make allowance for any premium existing, at the date of the\r\nassessment, on the internal purchasing power of the franc over that of\r\nits external exchange–equivalent in gold. But in April 1921 the franc\r\nwas not far from its proper “purchasing power parity,” and I calculate\r\nthat on this basis it would have been approximately accurate to have\r\nequated the gold mark with 3 paper francs. The rate of 2.20 had the\r\neffect, therefore, of inflating the French claim against Germany very\r\nmaterially.\r\n\r\nAt this rate the claim of 127 milliard paper francs for material damage\r\nwas equivalent to 57.7 milliard gold marks, of which the chief items\r\nwere as follows:\r\n\r\n  ──────────────────────┬───────────────┬─────────────\r\n                        │Francs (paper),│Marks (Gold),\r\n                        │   millions.   │  millions.\r\n  ──────────────────────┼───────────────┼─────────────\r\n  Industrial damages    │    38,882     │    17,673\r\n  Damage to houses      │    36,892     │    16,768\r\n  Furniture and fittings│    25,119     │    11,417\r\n  Unbuilt-on land       │    21,671     │     9,850\r\n  State property        │     1,958     │       890\r\n  Public works          │     2,583     │     1,174\r\n                        ├───────────────┼─────────────\r\n      Total             │   127,105     │    57,772\r\n  ──────────────────────┴───────────────┴─────────────\r\n\r\nThis total is one which I believe to be a vast, indeed a fantastic,\r\nexaggeration beyond anything which it would be possible to justify\r\nunder cross–examination. At the date when I wrote _The Economic\r\nConsequences of the Peace_, exact statistics as to the damage done were\r\nnot available, and it was only possible to fix a maximum limit to a\r\nreasonable claim, having regard to the pre–war wealth of the invaded\r\ndistricts. Now, however, much more detail is available with which to\r\ncheck the claim.\r\n\r\nThe following particulars are quoted from a statement made by M. Briand\r\nin the French Senate on April 6, 1921, supplemented by an official\r\nmemorandum published a few days later, and represent the position at\r\nabout that date:[68]\r\n\r\n(1) The population inhabiting the devastated districts in April 1921\r\nwas 4,100,000, as compared with 4,700,000 in 1914.\r\n\r\n(2) Of the cultivable land 95 per cent of the surface had been\r\nreleveled and 90 per cent had been plowed and was producing crops.\r\n\r\n(3) 293,733 houses were totally destroyed, in replacement of which\r\n132,000 provisional dwellings of different kinds had been erected.\r\n\r\n(4) 296,502 houses were partially destroyed, of which 281,300 had been\r\nrepaired.\r\n\r\n(5) Fifty per cent of the factories were again working.\r\n\r\n(6) Out of 2404 kilometers of railway destroyed, practically the whole\r\nhad been reconstructed.\r\n\r\nIt seems, therefore, that, apart from refurnishing and from the\r\nrebuilding of houses and factories, the greater part of which had\r\nstill to be accomplished, the bulk of the devastation was already made\r\ngood out of the daily labor of France within two years of the Peace\r\nConference, before Germany had paid anything.\r\n\r\nThis is a great achievement,—one more demonstration of the riches\r\naccruing to France from the patient industry of peasants, which makes\r\nher one of the rich countries of the world, in spite of the corrupt\r\nParisian finance which for a generation past has wasted the savings\r\nof her investors. When we look at Northern France we see what honest\r\nFrenchmen can accomplish.[69] But when we turn to the money claims\r\nwhich are based on this, we are back in the atmosphere of Parisian\r\nfinance,—so grasping, faithless, and extravagantly unveracious as to\r\ndefeat in the end its own objects.\r\n\r\nFor let us compare some of these items of devastation with the claims\r\nlodged.\r\n\r\n(1) 293,733 houses were totally destroyed and 296,502 were partially\r\ndestroyed. Since nearly all the latter have been repaired, we shall\r\nnot be underestimating the damage in assuming, for the purposes of a\r\nrough comparison, that, on the average, the damaged houses were _half_\r\ndestroyed, which gives us altogether the equivalent of 442,000 houses\r\ntotally destroyed. Turning back, we find that the French Government’s\r\nclaim for damage to houses was 16,768 million gold marks, that is to\r\nsay $4,192,000,000. Dividing this sum by the number of houses, we find\r\nan average claim of $9,480, per house![70] This is a claim for what\r\nwere chiefly peasants’ and miners’ cottages and the tenements of small\r\ncountry towns. M. Tardieu has quoted M. Loucheur as saying that the\r\nhouses in the Lens–Courrières district were worth 5000 francs ($1000)\r\na–piece before the war, but would cost 15,000 francs to rebuild after\r\nthe war, which sounds not at all unreasonable. In April 1921 the cost\r\nof building construction in Paris (which had been a good deal higher\r\nsome months before) was estimated to be, in terms of paper francs,\r\nthree and a half times the pre–war figure.[71] But even if we take the\r\ncost in francs at five times the pre–war figure, namely 25,000 paper\r\nfrancs per house, the claim lodged by the French Government is still\r\nthree and a half times the truth. I fancy that the discrepancy, here\r\nand also under other heads, may be partly explained by the inclusion\r\nin the official French claim of indirect damages, namely, for loss of\r\nrent—_perte de loyer_. It does not appear what attitude the Reparation\r\nCommission took up towards _indirect_ pecuniary and business losses\r\narising in the devastated districts out of the war. But I do not think\r\nthat such claims are admissible under the Treaty. Such losses, real\r\nthough they were, were not essentially different from analogous losses\r\noccurring in other areas, and indeed throughout the territory of the\r\nAllies. The maximum claim, however, on this head would not go far\r\ntowards justifying the above figure, and we can allow a considerable\r\nmargin of error for such additional items without impairing the\r\nconclusion that the claim is exaggerated. In _The Economic Consequences\r\nof the Peace_ (p. 127) I estimated that $1,250,000,000 might be a fair\r\nestimate for damage to house property; and I still think that this was\r\nabout right.\r\n\r\n(2) This claim for damage to houses is exclusive of furniture and\r\nfittings, which are the subject of a separate claim, namely, for 11,417\r\nmillion gold marks, or about $2,850,000,000. To check this figure let\r\nus assume that the whole of the furniture and fittings were destroyed,\r\nnot only where the houses were destroyed, but also in every case where\r\na house was damaged. This is an overstatement, but we may set it off\r\nagainst the fact that in a good many cases the furniture may have been\r\nlooted and not recovered by restitution (a large amount has, in fact,\r\nbeen recovered in this way), although the structure of the house was\r\nnot damaged at all. The total number of houses damaged or destroyed\r\nwas 590,000. Dividing this into $2,850,000,000, we have an average of\r\nnearly $5,000 per house—an average valuation of the furniture and\r\nfittings in each peasant’s or collier’s house of nearly $5,000! I\r\nhesitate to guess how great an overstatement shows itself here.\r\n\r\n(3) The largest claim of all, however, is for “industrial damages,”\r\nnamely, 17,673 million gold marks, or about $4,400,000,000. In 1919 M.\r\nLoucheur estimated the cost of reconstruction of the coal mines at 2000\r\nmillion francs, that is $400,000,000 at the par of exchange.[72] As\r\nthe pre–war value of all the coal mines in Great Britain was estimated\r\nat only $650,000,000, and as the pre–war output of the British mines\r\nwas fifteen times that of the invaded districts of France, this figure\r\nseems high.[73] But even if we accept it, there is still four thousand\r\nmillion dollars to account for. The great textile industries of Lille\r\nand Roubaix were robbed of their raw material, but their plant was not\r\nseriously injured, as is shown by the fact that in 1920 the woolen\r\nindustry of these districts was already employing 93.8 per cent and the\r\ncotton industry 78.8 per cent of their pre–war personnel. At Tourcoing\r\n55 factories out of 57 were in operation, and at Roubaix 46 out of\r\n48.[74]\r\n\r\nAltogether 11,500 industrial establishments are said to have been\r\ninterfered with, but this includes every village workshop, and about\r\nthree–quarters of them employed less than 20 persons. Half of them were\r\nat work again by the spring of 1921. What is the average claim made on\r\ntheir behalf? Deducting the coal mines as above and dividing the total\r\nclaim by 11,500, we reach an average figure of nearly $35,000. The\r\nexaggeration seems _prima facie_ on as high a scale as in the case of\r\nhouses and furniture.\r\n\r\n(4) The remaining item of importance is for unbuilt–on land. The\r\nclaim under this head is for 9850 million gold marks, or about\r\n$2,460,000,000. M. Tardieu (_op. cit._, p. 347) quotes Mr. Lloyd\r\nGeorge as follows, in the course of a discussion during the Peace\r\nConference in which he was pointing out the excessive character of\r\nthe French claims: “If you had to spend the money which you ask for\r\nthe reconstruction of the devastated regions of the North of France,\r\nI assert that you could not manage to spend it. Besides, the land is\r\nstill there. Although it has been badly upheaved in parts, it has not\r\ndisappeared. Even if you put the Chemin des Dames up to auction, you\r\nwould find buyers.” Mr. Lloyd George’s view has been justified by\r\nevents. In April 1921 the French Prime Minister was able to tell his\r\nSenate that 95 per cent of the cultivable land had been releveled and\r\nthat 90 per cent had been plowed and was producing crops. Some go so\r\nfar as to maintain that the fertility of the soil has been actually\r\nimproved by the disturbance of its surface and by its lying fallow\r\nfor several years. But apart from its having proved easier than was\r\nanticipated to make good this category of damage, the total cultivated\r\narea (excluding woodland) of the whole of the eleven Departments\r\naffected was about 6,650,000 acres, of which 270,000 acres were in the\r\n“zone of destruction,” 2,000,000 acres in the “zone of trenches and\r\nbombardment,” and 4,200,000 acres in the “zone of simple occupation.”\r\nThe claim, therefore, averaged _over the whole area_, works out at\r\nabout $370 per acre and, averaged over the first two categories above,\r\nat more than $1000 per acre. This claim, though it is described as\r\nbeing in respect of unbuilt–on land, probably includes farm buildings\r\n(other than houses), implements, live stock, and the growing crops of\r\nAugust 1914. As experience has proved that the permanent qualities of\r\nthe land have only been seriously impaired over a small area, these\r\nlatter items should probably constitute the major part of the claim.\r\nWe have also to allow for destruction of woodlands. But even with high\r\nestimates for each of these items, I do not see how we could reach a\r\ntotal above a third of the amount actually claimed.\r\n\r\nThese arguments are not exact, but they are sufficiently so to\r\ndemonstrate that the claim sent in to the Reparation Commission is\r\nuntenable. I believe that it is at least four times the truth. But\r\nit is possible that I have overlooked some items of claim, and it is\r\nbetter in discussions of this kind to leave a wide margin for possible\r\nerror. I assert, therefore, that on the average the claim is not less\r\nthan two or three times the truth.\r\n\r\nI have spent much time over the French claim, because it is the\r\nlargest, and because more particulars are available about it than\r\nabout the claims of the other Allies. On the face of it, the Belgian\r\nclaim is open to the same criticism as the French. But in this claim a\r\nlarger part is played by levies on the civilian population and personal\r\ninjuries to civilians. The material damage, however, was on a very\r\nmuch smaller scale than in France. Belgian industry is already working\r\nat its pre–war efficiency, and the amount of reconstruction still to\r\nbe made good is not on a great scale. The Belgian Minister for Home\r\nAffairs stated in Parliament in February 1920 that at the date of the\r\nArmistice 80,000 houses and 1100 public buildings had been destroyed.\r\nThis suggests that the Belgian claim on this head ought to be about a\r\nquarter of the French claim; but in view of the greater wealth of the\r\ninvaded districts of France, the Belgian loss is probably decidedly\r\nless than a quarter of the French loss. The claim, actually submitted\r\nby Belgium, for property, shipping, civilians and prisoners (that is to\r\nsay, the aggregate claim apart from pensions and allowances) amounted\r\nto 34,254 million Belgian francs. Inasmuch as the Belgian Ministry of\r\nFinance, in an official survey published in 1913, estimate the entire\r\nwealth of the country at 29,525 million Belgian francs, it is evident\r\nthat, even allowing for the diminished value of the Belgian franc,\r\nwhich is our measuring rod, this claim is very grossly excessive. I\r\nshould guess that the degree of exaggeration is quite as great as in\r\nthe case of France.\r\n\r\nThe British Empire claim is, apart from pensions and allowances, almost\r\nentirely in respect of shipping losses. The tonnage lost and damaged\r\nis definitely known. The value of the cargoes carried is a matter of\r\ndifficult guesswork. On the basis of an average of $150 for the hull\r\nand $200 for the cargo per gross ton lost, I estimated the claim in\r\n_The Economic Consequences of the Peace_ (p. 132) at $2,700,000,000.\r\nThe actual claim lodged was for $3,835,000,000. Much depends on the\r\ndate at which the cost of replacement is calculated. Most of the\r\ntonnage was in fact replaced out of vessels the building of which\r\ncommenced before the end of the war or shortly afterwards, and thus\r\ncost a much higher price than prevailed in, _e.g._, 1921. But even so\r\nthe claim lodged is very high. It seems to be based on an estimate of\r\n$500 per gross ton lost for hull and cargo together, any excess in this\r\nbeing set off against the fact that no separate allowance is made for\r\nvessels damaged or molested, but not sunk. This figure is the highest\r\nfor which any sort of plausible argument could be adduced, rather than\r\na judicial estimate. I adhere to the estimate which I gave in _The\r\nEconomic Consequences of the Peace_.\r\n\r\nI forbear to examine the claims of the other Allies. The details, so\r\nfar as they have been published, are given in Appendix No. 3.\r\n\r\nThe observations made above relate to the claims for material damage\r\nand do not bear on those for pensions and allowances, which are,\r\nnevertheless, a very large item. These latter are to be calculated,\r\naccording to the Treaty, in the case of pensions “as being the\r\ncapitalized cost at the date of coming into force of the Treaty, on the\r\nbasis of the scales in force in France at such date,” and in the case\r\nof allowances made during hostilities to the dependents of mobilized\r\npersons “on the basis of the average scale for such payments in force\r\nin France” during each year. That is to say, the French Army scale is\r\nto be applied all round; and the result, given the numbers affected,\r\nshould be a calculable figure, in which there should be little room\r\nfor serious error. The actual claims were as follows in milliard gold\r\nmarks:[75]\r\n\r\n                   Milliard marks\r\n                      (gold).\r\n\r\n  France                 33\r\n  British Empire         37\r\n  Italy                  17\r\n  Belgium                 1\r\n  Japan                   1\r\n  Roumania                4\r\n                         ──\r\n                         93\r\n\r\nThis does not include Serbia, for which a separate figure is not\r\navailable, or the United States. The total would work out, therefore,\r\nat about 100 milliard gold marks.[76]\r\n\r\nWhat does the aggregate of the claims work out at under all heads,\r\nand what relation does this total bear to the final assessment of\r\nthe Reparation Commission? As the claims are stated in a variety of\r\nnational currencies, it is not quite a simple matter to reach a total.\r\nIn the following table French francs are converted into gold marks at\r\n2.20 (the rate adopted by the Commission as explained above), sterling\r\napproximately at par (on the analogy of the rate for francs), Belgian\r\nfrancs at the same rate as French francs, Italian lire at twice this\r\nrate, Serbian dinars at four times this rate, and Japanese yen at par.\r\n\r\n                         Milliard marks\r\n                            (gold).\r\n\r\n  France                       99\r\n  British Empire               54\r\n  Italy                        27\r\n  Belgium                      16½\r\n  Japan                         1½\r\n  Jugo–Slavia                   9½\r\n  Roumania                     14\r\n  Greece                        2\r\n                              ────\r\n                              223½\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are omitted from this table Poland and Czecho–Slovakia, of\r\nwhich the claims are probably inadmissible, the United States, which\r\nsubmitted no claim, and certain minor claimants shown in Appendix No. 3.\r\n\r\nIn round figures, therefore, we may put the claims as lodged before the\r\nReparations Commission at about 225 milliard gold marks, of which 95\r\nmilliards was in respect of pensions and allowances, and 130 milliards\r\nfor claims under other heads.\r\n\r\nThe Reparation Commission in announcing its decision did not\r\nparticularize as between different claimants or as between different\r\nheads of claim, and merely stated a lump sum figure. Their figure was\r\n132 milliards; that is to say, about 58 per cent of the sums claimed.\r\nThis decision was in no way concerned with Germany’s capacity to pay,\r\nand was simply an assessment, intended to be judicial, as to the sum\r\njustly due under the heads of claim established by the Treaty of\r\nVersailles.\r\n\r\nThe decision was unanimous, but only in face of sharp differences of\r\nopinion. It is not suitable or in accordance with decency to set up a\r\nbody of interested representatives to give a judicial decision in their\r\nown case. This arrangement was an offspring of the assumption which\r\nruns through the Treaty that the Allies are incapable of doing wrong,\r\nor even of partiality.\r\n\r\nNothing has been published in England about the discussions which led\r\nup to this conclusion. But M. Poincaré, at one time President of the\r\nReparation Commission and presumably well–informed about its affairs,\r\nhas lifted a corner of the veil in an article published in the _Revue\r\ndes Deux Mondes_ for May 15, 1921. He there divulges the fact that\r\nthe final result was a compromise between the French and the British\r\nrepresentatives, the latter of whom endeavored to fix the figure at\r\n104 milliards, and defended this adjudication with skilful and even\r\npassionate advocacy.[77]\r\n\r\nWhen the decision of the Reparation Commission was first announced,\r\nand was found to abate so largely the claims lodged with it, I hailed\r\nit, led away a little perhaps by its very close agreement with my own\r\npredictions, as a great triumph for justice in international affairs.\r\nSo, in a measure, I still think it. The Reparation Commission went a\r\nconsiderable way in disavowing the veracity of the claims of the Allied\r\nGovernments. Indeed, their reduction of the claims for items other than\r\npensions and allowances must have been very great since the claims for\r\npensions, being capable of more or less exact calculation,[78] can\r\nhardly have been subject to an initial error of anything approaching\r\n42 per cent. If, for example, they reduced the claim for pensions and\r\nallowances from 95 to 80 milliards, they must have reduced the other\r\nclaims from 130 milliards to 52 milliards, that is to say, by 60 per\r\ncent. Yet even so, on the data now available, I do not believe that\r\ntheir adjudication could be maintained before an impartial tribunal.\r\nThe figure of 104 milliards, attributed by M. Poincaré to Sir John\r\nBradbury, is probably the nearest we shall get to a strictly impartial\r\nassessment.\r\n\r\nTo complete our summary of the facts two particulars must be added.\r\n(1) The total, as assessed by the Reparation Commission, comprehends\r\nthe total claim against Germany _and her Allies_. It includes, that\r\nis to say, the damage done by the armies of Austria–Hungary, Turkey,\r\nand Bulgaria, as well as by those of Germany. Payments, if any, made\r\nby Germany’s Allies must, presumably, be deducted from the sum due.\r\nBut Annex I. of the Reparation Chapter of the Treaty of Versailles\r\nis so drafted as to render Germany liable for the whole amount. (2)\r\nThis total is exclusive of the sum due under the Treaty for the\r\nreimbursement of sums lent to Belgium by her Allies during the war. At\r\nthe date of the London Agreement (May 1921) Germany’s liability under\r\nthis head was provisionally estimated at 3 milliard gold marks. But it\r\nhad not then been decided at what rate these loans, which were made in\r\nterms of dollars, sterling, and francs, should be converted into gold\r\nmarks. The question was referred for arbitration to Mr. Boyden, the\r\nUnited States Delegate on the Reparation Commission, and at the end of\r\nSeptember 1921 he announced his decision to the effect that the rate of\r\nconversion should be based on the rate of exchange prevailing at the\r\ndate of the Armistice. Including interest at 5 per cent, as provided by\r\nthe Treaty, I estimate that this liability amounts at the end of 1921\r\nto about 6 milliard gold marks, of which slightly more than a third is\r\ndue to Great Britain and slightly less than a third each to France and\r\nthe United States respectively.\r\n\r\nI take, therefore, as my final conclusion that the best available\r\nestimate of the sum due from Germany, under the strict letter of\r\nthe Treaty of Versailles, is 110 milliard gold marks, which may be\r\ndivided between the main categories of claim in the proportions—74\r\nmilliards for pensions and allowances, 30 milliards for direct damage\r\nto the property and persons of civilians, and 6 milliards for war debt\r\nincurred by Belgium.\r\n\r\nThis total is more than Germany can pay. But the claim exclusive of\r\npensions and allowances should be within her capacity. The inclusion of\r\na demand for pensions and allowances was the subject of a long struggle\r\nand a bitter controversy in Paris. I have argued that those were right\r\nwho maintained that this demand was inconsistent with the terms on\r\nwhich Germany surrendered at the Armistice. I return to this subject in\r\nthe next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              EXCURSUS V\r\n\r\n              RECEIPTS AND EXPENSES PRIOR TO MAY 1, 1921\r\n\r\nThe provision in the Treaty of Versailles that Germany, subject to\r\ncertain deductions, was to pay $5000 millions (gold) before May\r\n1, 1921, was so remarkably wide of facts and possibilities, that\r\nfor some time past no one has said much about this offspring of the\r\nunimaginative imaginations of Paris. As it was totally abandoned by the\r\nLondon Agreement of May 5, 1921, there is no need to return to what is\r\nan obsolete controversy. But it is interesting to record what payments\r\nGermany did actually effect during the transitional period.\r\n\r\nThe following details are from a statement published by the British\r\nTreasury in August 1921:\r\n\r\nAPPROXIMATE STATEMENT BY THE REPARATION COMMISSION OF DELIVERIES MADE\r\nBY GERMANY FROM NOVEMBER 11, 1918, TO APRIL 30, 1921\r\n\r\n                                                        Gold Marks.\r\n\r\n  Receipts in cash                                       99,334,000\r\n  Deliveries in kind:\r\n    Ships                                               270,331,000\r\n    Coal                                                437,160,000\r\n    Dyestuffs                                            36,823,000\r\n    Other deliveries                                    937,040,000\r\n                                                     ──────────────\r\n                                                      1,780,688,000\r\n\r\n  Immovable property and assets not yet encashed      2,754,104,000\r\n                                                     ──────────────\r\n                                                      4,534,792,000\r\n                                                 say $1,130,000,000\r\n\r\nThe immovable property consists chiefly of the Saar coalfields\r\nsurrendered to France, State property in Schleswig surrendered to\r\nDenmark, and State property (with certain exceptions) in the territory\r\ntransferred to Poland.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the cash, two–thirds of the ships, and a quarter of\r\nthe dyestuffs accrued to Great Britain. A share of the ships and\r\ndyestuffs, the Saar coalfields, the bulk of the coal and of the “other\r\ndeliveries,” including valuable materials left behind by the German\r\nArmy, accrued to France. Some ships, a proportion of the coal and other\r\ndeliveries, and the compensation, payable by Denmark in respect of\r\nSchleswig, fell to Belgium. Italy obtained a portion of the coal and\r\nships and some other trifles. The value of German State property in\r\nPoland could not be transferred to any one but Poland.\r\n\r\nBut the sums thus received were not available for Reparation. There had\r\nto be deducted from them (1) the sums returned to Germany under the Spa\r\nAgreement, namely 360,000,000 gold marks,[79] and (2) the costs of the\r\nArmies of Occupation.\r\n\r\nIn September 1921 the Reparation Commission published an approximate\r\nestimate, as follows, of the cost of occupation of German territory by\r\nthe Allied Armies from the Armistice until May 1, 1921:\r\n\r\n  ───────────────┬─────────────────────┬───────────────\r\n                 │                     │   Cost per man\r\n                 │       Total cost.   │     per day.\r\n  ───────────────┼─────────────────────┼───────────────\r\n  United States  │      $278,067,610   │       $4.50\r\n  Great Britain  │      £52,881,298    │        14s.\r\n  France         │  Frs. 2,304,850,470 │    Frs. 15.25\r\n  Belgium        │   Frs. 378,731,390  │    Frs. 16.50\r\n  Italy          │    Frs. 15,207,717  │     Frs. 22\r\n  ───────────────┴─────────────────────┴───────────────\r\n\r\nThe conversion of these sums into gold marks raises the usual\r\ncontroversy as to the rates at which conversion is to be effected.\r\nThe total was estimated, however, at three milliard gold marks,[80]\r\nof which one milliard was owed to the United States, one milliard to\r\nFrance, 900 millions to Great Britain, 175 millions to Belgium, and 5\r\nmillions to Italy. On May 1, 1921, France had about 70,000 soldiers on\r\nthe Rhine, Great Britain about 18,000, and the United States a trifling\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\nThe net result of the transitional period was, therefore, as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) Putting on one side State property transferred to Poland, the whole\r\nof the transferable wealth obtained from Germany in the two and a\r\nhalf years following the Armistice under all the rigors of the Treaty,\r\ndesigned as they were to extract every available liquid asset, just\r\nabout covered the costs of collection, that is to say, the expenses of\r\nthe Armies of Occupation, and left _nothing_ over for Reparation.\r\n\r\n(2) But as the United States has not yet been paid the milliard owing\r\nto her for her Army, the other Allies have received between them on\r\nbalance a surplus of about one milliard. This surplus was not divided\r\namongst them equally. Great Britain had received 450–500 million gold\r\nmarks _less_ than her expenses, Belgium 300–350 million _more_ than her\r\nexpenses, and France 1000–1200 millions _more_ than her expenses.[81]\r\n\r\nUnder the strict letter of the Treaty those Allies who had received\r\nless than their share might have claimed to be paid the difference in\r\ncash by those who had received more. This situation and the allocation\r\nof the milliard paid by Germany between May and August 1921 were the\r\nsubject of the Financial Agreement provisionally signed at Paris on\r\nAugust 13, 1921. This Agreement chiefly consisted of concessions\r\nto France, partly by Belgium, who agreed in effect to a partial\r\npostponement of her priority charge on two milliards out of the\r\nfirst sums received from Germany for Reparation, and partly by Great\r\nBritain, who accepted for the purposes of internal accounting amongst\r\nthe Allies themselves a lower value for the coal delivered by Germany\r\nthan the value fixed by the Treaty.[82] In view of these concessions\r\nabout future payment, the _first_ milliard in cash, received _after_\r\nMay 1, 1921, was divided between Great Britain and Belgium, the former\r\nreceiving 450 million gold marks in discharge of the balance still due\r\nto her in respect of the costs of occupation, and the balance falling\r\nto the latter as a further instalment of her agreed priority charge.\r\nThis Agreement was represented in the French press as laying new\r\nburdens upon France, or at least as withdrawing existing rights from\r\nher. But this was not the case. The Agreement was directed throughout\r\nto moderating the harshness with which the letter of the Treaty and the\r\narrangements of Spa would have operated against France.[83]\r\n\r\nThe actual value of these deliveries is a striking example of how\r\nfar the value of deliverable articles falls below the estimates which\r\nused to be current. The Reparation Commission have stated that the\r\ncredit which Germany will receive in respect of her Mercantile Marine\r\nwill amount to about 755 million gold marks. This figure is low,\r\npartly because many of the ships were disposed of after the slump in\r\ntonnage.[84] Nevertheless, this was one of the tangible assets of great\r\nvalue, which it was customary at one time to invoke in answer to those\r\nwho disputed Germany’s capacity to make vast payments. What does it\r\namount to in relation to the bill against her? The bill is 138 milliard\r\ngold marks, on which interest at 6 per cent for one year is 8280\r\nmillion gold marks. That is to say, Germany’s Mercantile Marine in its\r\nentirety, of which the surrender humbled so much pride and engulfed so\r\nvast an effort, would about meet a month’s charges.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              EXCURSUS VI\r\n\r\n              THE DIVISION OF RECEIPTS AMONGST THE ALLIES\r\n\r\nThe Allied Governments took advantage of the Spa meeting (July 1920)\r\nto settle amongst themselves a Reparation question which had given\r\nmuch trouble in Paris and had been left unsolved[85]—namely, the\r\nproportions in which the Reparation receipts are to be divided between\r\nthe various Allied claimants.[86] The Treaty provides that the receipts\r\nfrom Germany will be divided by the Allies “in proportions which _have_\r\nbeen determined upon by them in advance, on a basis of general equity\r\nand of the rights of each.” The failure, described by M. Tardieu, to\r\nreach an agreement in Paris, rendered the tense of this provision\r\ninaccurate, but at Spa it was settled as follows:\r\n\r\n  France                52  per cent.\r\n  British Empire[87]    22     ”\r\n  Italy                 10     ”\r\n  Belgium                8     ”\r\n  Japan and Portugal      ¾ of 1 per cent each;\r\n\r\nthe remaining 6½ per cent being reserved for the Serbo–Croat–Slovene\r\nState and for Greece, Rumania, and other Powers not signatories of the\r\nSpa Agreement.[88]\r\n\r\nThis settlement represented some concession on the part of Great\r\nBritain, whose proportionate claim was greatly increased by the\r\ninclusion of pensions beyond what it would have been on the basis of\r\nReparation proper; and the proportion claimed by Mr. Lloyd George in\r\nParis was probably nearer the truth (namely that the French and British\r\nshares should be in the proportion 5 to 3). I estimate that France\r\n45 per cent, British Empire 33 per cent, Italy 10 per cent, Belgium\r\n6 per cent, and the rest 6 per cent would have been more exactly in\r\naccordance with the claims of each under the Treaty. In view of all the\r\nfacts, however, the Spa division may be held to have done substantial\r\njustice on the whole.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the priority to Belgium to the extent of $500,000,000\r\nwas confirmed; and it was agreed that the loans made to Belgium\r\nduring the war by the other Allies, for which Germany is liable under\r\nArticle 232[89] of the Treaty, should be dealt with out of the moneys\r\nnext received. These loans, including interest, will amount by the end\r\nof 1921 to something in the neighborhood of $1,500,000,000, of which\r\n$550,000,000 will be due to Great Britain, $500,000,000 to France, and\r\n$450,000,000 to the United States.\r\n\r\nUnder the Spa Agreement, therefore, sums received from Germany in cash,\r\nand credits in respect of deliveries in kind were to be applied to the\r\ndischarge of her obligations in the following order:\r\n\r\n1. The cost of the Armies of Occupation, estimated at $750,000,000 up\r\nto May 1, 1921.\r\n\r\n2. Advances to Germany for food purchases under the Spa Agreement, say\r\n$90,000,000.\r\n\r\n3. Belgian priority of $500,000,000.\r\n\r\n4. Repayment of Allied advances to Belgium, say $1,500,000,000.\r\n\r\nThis amounts to about $2,850,000,000 altogether, of which I estimate\r\nthat about $750,000,000 is due to France, $850,000,000 to Great\r\nBritain, $550,000,000 to Belgium, and $700,000,000 to the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nVery few people, I think, have appreciated how large a sum is due to\r\nthe United States under the strict letter of the Agreement. Since\r\nFrance has already received almost two–thirds of her share as above,\r\nwhilst Belgium has had about one–third, Great Britain less than\r\none–third, and the United States nothing, it follows that, even on\r\nthe most favorable hypothesis as to Germany’s impending payments,\r\ncomparatively small sums are strictly due to France in the near future.\r\n\r\nThe Financial Agreement of August 13, 1921, was aimed at modifying the\r\nharshness of these priority provisions towards France.[90] The details\r\nof this Agreement have not yet been published, but it is said to make\r\na somewhat different provision from that contemplated at Spa for the\r\nrepayment of Allied war advances to Belgium.\r\n\r\nThe reception of this Agreement by the French public was a good\r\nillustration of the effect of keeping people in the dark. The effect of\r\nthe Spa Agreement had never been understood in France, with the result\r\nthat the August Financial Agreement, which much improved France’s\r\nposition, was believed to interfere seriously with her existing rights.\r\nM. Doumer never had the pluck to tell his public the truth, although,\r\nif he had, it would have been clear that, in signing the Agreement\r\nprovisionally, he was acting in the interests of his country.\r\n\r\nThe mention of the United States invites attention to the anomalous\r\nposition of that country under the Peace Treaty. Her failure to ratify\r\nthe Treaty forfeits none of her rights under it, either in respect of\r\nher share of the costs of the Army of Occupation (which, however, is\r\noffset to a small extent by the German ships she has retained), or\r\nin respect of the repayment of her war advances to Belgium.[91] It\r\nfollows that the United States is entitled, on the strict letter, to a\r\nconsiderable part of the cash receipts from Germany in the near future.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a possible offset to these claims which has been\r\nmentioned already (p. 78) but must not be overlooked here. Under the\r\nTreaty, private German property in an Allied country is, in the case\r\nof countries adopting the Clearing House Scheme, applied in the first\r\ninstance to debts owing from German nationals to the nationals of the\r\nAllied country in question, and the balance, if any, is retained for\r\nReparation. What is to happen in the case of similar German assets\r\nin the United States is still undetermined. The surplus assets, the\r\nvalue of which may be about $300,000,000,[92] will be retained, until\r\nCongress determines otherwise, by the Enemy Property Custodian. There\r\nhave been negotiations from time to time for a loan in favor of Germany\r\non the security of these assets, but the legal position has rendered\r\nprogress impossible. At any rate this important German asset is still\r\nunder American control.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[60] A fairly adequate account of this controversy during the Peace\r\nConference can be pieced together from the following passages: Baruch,\r\n_Making of Reparation and Economic Sections of the Treaty_, pp. 45–55;\r\nLamont, _What really happened at Paris_, pp. 262–265; Tardieu, _The\r\nTruth about the Treaty_, pp. 294–309.\r\n\r\n[61] For these figures see Tardieu, _op. cit._, p. 305.\r\n\r\n[62] It is of these passages that M. Clemenceau wrote as follows in his\r\npreface to M. Tardieu’s book: “Fort en thème d’économiste, M. Keynes\r\n(qui ne fut pas seul, dans la Conférence, à professer cette opinion)\r\ncombat, sans aucun ménagement, ‘l’abus des exigences des Alliés’\r\n(lisez: ‘de la France’) et de ses négociateurs.... Ces reproches et\r\ntant d’autres d’une violence brutale, dont je n’aurais rien dit, si\r\nl’auteur, à tous risques, n’eût cru servir sa cause en les livrant à\r\nla publicité, font assez clairement voir jusqu’où certains esprits\r\ns’étaient montés.” (In the English edition, M. Tardieu has caused the\r\nwords _fort en thème d’économiste_ to be translated by the words “with\r\nsome knowledge of economics but neither imagination nor character”—which\r\nseems rather a free rendering.)\r\n\r\n[63] At about the same date, the German Indemnity Commission\r\n(_Reichsentschädigungskommission_) estimated the cost at 7228 million\r\ngold marks, also on the basis of pre–war prices; that is to say, at\r\nabout one–seventh of M. Dubois’ estimate.\r\n\r\n[64] The details of this claim, so far as they have been published,\r\nare given in Appendix No. 3. The above figure comprises the items\r\nfor Industrial Damages, Damage to Houses, Furniture and Fittings,\r\nUnbuilt–on Land, State Property, and Public Works.\r\n\r\n[65] See M. Loucheur’s speech in the French Chamber, May 20, 1921.\r\n\r\n[66] For this rate to be justified the exchange value of the franc in\r\nNew York must rise to about 11 cents.\r\n\r\n[67] M. Loucheur’s statement to the French Chamber implied that the\r\nrate of conversion was applicable to material damage as well as to\r\npensions, and I have assumed this in what follows; but precise official\r\ninformation is lacking.\r\n\r\n[68] The figures of damage done, given by M. Briand, are generally\r\nspeaking rather lower than those given ten months earlier (in June\r\n1920) in a report by M. Tardieu in his capacity as President of the\r\nComité des Régions Dévastées. But the difference is not very material.\r\nFor purposes of comparison, I give M. Tardieu’s figures below together\r\nwith those of the amount of reconstruction completed at that earlier\r\ndate:\r\n\r\n                                 Destroyed.

Brenier, who has spent much time criticizing me, quotes\r\nwith approval (_The Times_, January 24, 1921) a French architect as\r\nestimating the cost of reconstruction at an average of $2,500 per\r\nhouse, and quotes also, without dissent, a German estimate that the\r\npre–war average was $1,200. He also states, in the same article, that\r\nthe number of houses destroyed was 304,191 and the number damaged\r\n290,425, or 594,616 in all. Having pointed out the importance of not\r\noverlooking sentiment in these questions, he then multiplies $2,500,\r\nnot by the number of houses but by the number of the _population_,\r\nand arrives at an answer of $3,750,000,000. What is one to reply to\r\nsentimental multiplication? What is the courteous retort to controversy\r\non these lines? (His other figures are clearly such a mass of\r\nmisprints, muddled arithmetic, confusion between hectares and acres\r\nand the like, that, whilst an attack could easily make a devastated\r\narea of them, it would be unfair to base any serious criticism on this\r\nwell–intentioned farrago. As a writer on these topics, M. Brenier is\r\nabout of the caliber of M. Raphaël–Georges Lévy.)\r\n\r\n[72] M. Tardieu states that, on account of the subsequent rise in\r\nprices, M. Loucheur’s estimate has proved, in terms of paper francs,\r\nto be inadequate. But this is allowed for by my having converted paper\r\nfrancs into dollars at the par of exchange.\r\n\r\n[73] The Lens coal mines, which were the object of most complete\r\ndestruction, comprised 29 pits, and had, in 1913, 16,000 workmen with\r\nan output of 4 million tons.\r\n\r\n[74] I take these figures from M. Tardieu, who argues, most\r\nilluminatingly, in alternate chapters, according to his thesis for the\r\ntime being, that reconstruction has hardly begun, and that it is nearly\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\n[75] Francs are here converted at 2.20 to the gold mark and the £\r\nsterling at the ratio of 1:20.\r\n\r\n[76] This is exactly the figure of the estimate which I gave in _The\r\nEconomic Consequences of the Peace_ (p. 160). But I there added: “I\r\nfeel much more confidence in the approximate accuracy of the total\r\nfigure than its division between the different claimants.” This proviso\r\nwas necessary, as I had over–estimated the claims of France and\r\nunder–estimated those of the British Empire and of Italy.\r\n\r\n[77] “Elle avait été le résultat d’un compromis assez pénible entre la\r\ndélégué français, l’honorable M. Dubois, et le représentant anglais,\r\nSir John Bradbury, depuis lors démissionnaire, qui voulait s’en tenir\r\nau chiffre de cent quatre milliards et qui avait défendu la thèse du\r\ngouvernement britannique avec une habileté passionnée.”\r\n\r\n[78] The chief question of legitimate controversy in this connection\r\nwas that of the rate of exchange for converting paper francs into gold\r\nmarks.\r\n\r\n[79] Made up of about £5,500,000 advanced by Great Britain, 772,000,000\r\nfrancs by France, 96,000,000 francs by Belgium, 147,000,000 lire by\r\nItaly, and 56,000,000 francs by Luxembourg.\r\n\r\n[80] The German authorities have published a somewhat higher figure.\r\nAccording to a memorandum submitted to the Reichstag in September\r\n1921 by their Finance Minister, the costs of the Armies of Occupation\r\nand the Rhine Provinces Commission up to the end of March 1921 were\r\nmks. 3,936,954,542 (gold), in respect of expenditure met in the first\r\ninstance by the occupying Powers, and subsequently recoverable from\r\nGermany, _plus_ mks. 7,313,911,829 (paper), in respect of expenditure\r\ndirectly met by the German authorities.\r\n\r\n[81] I do not vouch for the accuracy of these figures, which are rough\r\nestimates of my own on the basis of incomplete published information.\r\n\r\n[82] On the other hand Great Britain’s view was adopted as to the\r\nvaluation of shipping.\r\n\r\n[83] In view of the political difficulties in which this Agreement\r\ninvolved M. Briand’s Cabinet, the matter was apparently adjusted by\r\nGreat Britain and Belgium receiving their quotas as above, “subject to\r\nadjustment of the final settlement” of the questions dealt with in the\r\nAgreement. The net result on September 30, 1921, was that, including\r\nthe above sum, Great Britain had been repaid £5,445,000 in respect\r\nof the Spa coal advances, and had also received, or was in course of\r\ncollecting, about £43,000,000 towards the expenses of the Army of\r\nOccupation (approximately £50,000,000). Thus, as the result of three\r\nyears’ Reparations, Great Britain’s costs of collection had been about\r\n£7,000,000 more than her receipts.\r\n\r\n[84] To value these ships at what they fetched during the slump, yet to\r\nvalue Germany’s liability for submarine destruction at what the ships\r\ncost to replace during the boom, appears to be unjust. My estimate (in\r\n_The Economic Consequences of the Peace_, p. 174) of the value of the\r\nships to be delivered was $600,000,000.\r\n\r\n[85] M. Tardieu (_The Truth about the Treaty_, pp. 346–348) has given\r\nan account of the abortive discussion of this question at the Peace\r\nConference. The French obtained at Spa a ratio very slightly _more_\r\nfavorable to themselves than that which they had claimed and Mr. Lloyd\r\nGeorge had rejected at Paris.\r\n\r\n[86] For a summary of the text of this Agreement see Appendix No. 1.\r\n\r\n[87] At the conference of Dominion Prime Ministers in July 1921 this\r\nshare was further divided as follows between the constituent portions\r\nof the Empire:\r\n\r\n United Kingdom   86.85  │  New Zealand   1.75\r\n Minor colonies     .80  │  South Africa   .60\r\n Canada            4.35  │  Newfoundland   .10\r\n Australia         4.35  │  India         1.20\r\n\r\n[88] The Spa Agreement also made provision that half the receipts from\r\nBulgaria and from the constituent parts of the former Austro–Hungarian\r\nEmpire should be divided in the above proportions, and that, of the\r\nother half, 40 per cent should go to Italy and 60 per cent to Greece,\r\nRumania, and Jugoslavia.\r\n\r\n[89] “Germany undertakes ... to make reimbursement of all sums which\r\nBelgium has borrowed from the Allies and Associated Governments up to\r\nNovember 11, 1918, together with interest at the rate of 5 per cent per\r\nannum on such sums.” The priority for this repayment arranged at Spa is\r\na little different from the procedure contemplated in the Treaty, which\r\nprovided for repayment not later than May 1, 1926.\r\n\r\n[90] See above, p. 135.\r\n\r\n[91] Article 1 of the Treaty of Peace between Germany and the United\r\nStates, signed on August 25, 1921, and since ratified, expressly\r\nstipulates that Germany undertakes to accord to the United States\r\nall the rights, privileges, indemnities, reparations, and advantages\r\nspecified in the joint resolution of Congress of July 2, 1921,\r\n“Including all the rights and advantages stipulated for the benefit\r\nof the United States under the Treaty of Versailles which the United\r\nStates shall enjoy notwithstanding the fact that such Treaty has not\r\nbeen ratified by the United States.”\r\n\r\n[92] According to a statement published in Washington in August\r\n1921 the Custodian had in his hands German property to the value of\r\n$314,179,463.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                THE LEGALITY OF THE CLAIM FOR PENSIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n “The application of morals to international politics is more a thing\r\n to be desired than a thing which has been in operation. Also, when\r\n I am made a participant in crime along with many millions of other\r\n people, I more or less shrug my shoulders.”—Letter from a friendly\r\n critic to the author of _The Economic Consequences of the Peace_.\r\n\r\nWe have seen in the preceding chapter that the claim for Pensions and\r\nAllowances is nearly double that for Devastation, so that its inclusion\r\nin the Allies’ demands nearly trebles the bill. It makes the difference\r\nbetween a demand which can be met and a demand which cannot be met.\r\nTherefore it is important.\r\n\r\nIn _The Economic Consequences of the Peace_ I gave reasons for the\r\nopinion that this claim was contrary to our engagements and an act\r\nof international immorality. A good deal has been written about it\r\nsince then, but I cannot admit that my conclusion has been seriously\r\ndisputed. Most American writers accept it; most French writers ignore\r\nit; and most English writers try to show, not that the _balance_ of\r\nevidence is against me, but that there are a few just plausible, or\r\njust not–negligible, observations to be made on the other side. Their\r\ncontention is that of the Jesuit professors of Probabilism in the\r\nseventeenth century, namely that the Allies are justified unless it is\r\nabsolutely certain that they are wrong, and that any probability in\r\ntheir favor, however small, is enough to save them from mortal sin.\r\n\r\nBut most people in the countries of Germany’s former enemies are not\r\nready to excite themselves very much, even if my view is accepted.\r\nThe passage at the head of this chapter describes a common attitude.\r\nInternational politics is a scoundrel’s game and always has been, and\r\nthe private citizen can scarcely feel himself personally responsible.\r\nIf our enemy breaks the rules, his action may furnish us with an\r\nappropriate opportunity for expressing our feelings; but this must not\r\nbe taken to commit us to a cool opinion that such things have never\r\nhappened before and must never happen again. Sensitive and honorable\r\npatriots do not like it, but they “more or less shrug” their shoulders.\r\n\r\nThere is some common sense in this. I cannot deny it. International\r\nmorality, interpreted as a crude legalism, might be very injurious to\r\nthe world. It is at least as true of these vast–scale transactions,\r\nas of private affairs, that we judge wrongly if we do not take into\r\naccount _everything_. And it is superficial to appeal, the other way\r\nround, to the principles which do duty when Propaganda is blistering\r\nherd emotion with its brew of passion, sentiment, self–interest, and\r\nmoral fiddlesticks.\r\n\r\nBut whilst I see that nothing rare has happened and that men’s motives\r\nare much as usual, I do still think that this particular act was an\r\nexceptionally mean one, made worse by hypocritical professions of moral\r\npurpose. My object in returning to it is partly historical and partly\r\npractical. New material of high interest is available to instruct us\r\nabout the course of events. And if for practical reasons we can agree\r\nto drop this claim, we shall make a settlement easier.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThose who think that it was contrary to the Allies’ engagements to\r\ncharge pensions against the enemy base this opinion on the terms\r\nnotified to the German Government by President Wilson, with the\r\nauthority of the Allies, on November 5, 1918, subject to which Germany\r\naccepted the Armistice conditions.[93] The contrary opinion that the\r\nAllies were fully entitled to charge pensions if they considered\r\nit expedient to do so, has been supported by two distinct lines of\r\nargument: first that the Armistice conditions of November 11, 1918,\r\nwere not _subject_ to President Wilson’s notification of November 5,\r\n1918, but _superseded_ it, more particularly regarding Reparation;\r\nand alternatively that the wording of President Wilson’s notification\r\nproperly understood does not exclude Pensions.\r\n\r\nThe first line of argument was adopted by M. Klotz and the French\r\nGovernment during the Peace Conference, and has been approved more\r\nrecently by M. Tardieu.[94] It was repudiated by the whole of the\r\nAmerican Delegation at Paris, and never definitely supported by the\r\nBritish Government. Responsible writers about the Treaty, other than\r\nFrench, have not admitted it.[95] It was also explicitly abandoned by\r\nthe Peace Conference itself in its reply to the German observations on\r\nthe first draft of the Treaty. The second line of argument was that\r\nof the British Government during the Peace Conference, and it was an\r\nargument on these lines which finally converted President Wilson. I\r\nwill deal with the two arguments in turn.\r\n\r\n1. Various persons have published particulars, formerly confidential,\r\nwhich allow us to reconstruct the course of the discussions about the\r\nArmistice. These begin with the examination of the Armistice Terms by\r\nthe Allied Council of War on November 1, 1918.[96]\r\n\r\nThe first point which emerges is that the reply of the Allied\r\nGovernments to President Wilson (which afterwards furnished the text of\r\nhis notification of Nov. 5, 1918, addressed to Germany), defining their\r\ninterpretation of the references to Reparation in the Fourteen Points,\r\nwas drawn up and approved at the _same_ session of the Supreme Council\r\n(that of November 1, 2) which drew up the relevant clauses of the\r\nArmistice Terms; and that the Allies did not finally approve the reply\r\nto President Wilson until _after_ that they had approved that very\r\ndraft of the Armistice Terms which, according to the French contention,\r\nsuperseded and negatived the terms outlined in the reply to President\r\nWilson.[97]\r\n\r\nThe record of the proceedings of the Supreme Council (as now disclosed)\r\nlends no support to the existence in their minds of the duplicity\r\nwhich the French contention attributes to them. On the other hand,\r\nit makes it clear that the Council did not intend the references to\r\nReparation in the Armistice Terms to modify in any way their reply to\r\nthe President.\r\n\r\nThe record, in so far as it is relevant to this point, may be\r\nsummarized as follows:[98] M. Clemenceau called attention to the\r\nabsence of any reference in the first draft of the Armistice Terms to\r\nthe restitution of stolen property or to reparation. Mr. Lloyd George\r\nreplied that there ought to be some reference to restitution, but that\r\nreparation was a Peace condition rather than an Armistice condition.\r\nM. Hymans agreed with Mr. Lloyd George. MM. Sonnino and Orlando went\r\nfurther and thought that neither had any place in the Armistice\r\nTerms but were ready to accept the Lloyd George–Hymans compromise of\r\nincluding Restitution but not Reparation. The discussion was postponed\r\nfor M. Hymans to draft a formula. On its resumption next day, it was\r\nM. Clemenceau who produced a formula consisting of the three words\r\n_Réparation des dommages_. M. Hymans, M. Sonnino, and Mr. Bonar Law\r\nall expressed doubt whether this was in place in the Armistice Terms.\r\nM. Clemenceau replied that he only wanted to mention the principle,\r\nand that French public opinion would be surprised if there was no\r\nreference to it. Mr. Bonar Law objected: “It is already mentioned in\r\nour letter to President Wilson which he is about to communicate to\r\nGermany. It is useless to repeat it.”[99] This observation met with no\r\ncontradiction, but it was agreed on sentimental grounds and for the\r\nsatisfaction of public opinion to add M. Clemenceau’s three words.\r\nThe Council then passed on to other topics. At the last moment, as\r\nthey were about to disperse, M. Klotz slipped in the words: “It would\r\nbe prudent to put at the head of the financial questions a clause\r\nreserving the future claims of the Allies, and I propose to you the\r\nwording ‘without prejudice to any subsequent claims and demands on the\r\npart of the Allies.’”[100] It does not seem to have occurred to any of\r\nthose present that this text could be deemed of material importance or\r\notherwise than as protecting the Allies from the risk of being held\r\nto have surrendered any existing claims through failure to mention\r\nthem in this document; and it was accepted without discussion. M.\r\nKlotz afterwards boasted that by this little device he had abolished\r\nthe Fourteen Points, so far as they affected Reparation and Finance\r\n(although the very same meeting of the Allies had despatched a Note to\r\nPresident Wilson accepting them), and had secured to the Allies the\r\nright to demand from Germany the whole cost of the War. But I think\r\nthe world will decide that the Supreme Council was right in attaching\r\nto these words no particular importance. Personal pride in so smart a\r\ntrick has led M. Klotz, and his colleague M. Tardieu, to persist too\r\nlong with a contention which decent persons have now abandoned.\r\n\r\nThere was an episode which has lately come to light connected with\r\nthis passage which may be recounted as illustrating the pitfalls\r\nof the world. As M. Klotz only introduced his form of words as the\r\nCouncil was breaking up, it is likely that no undue attention was\r\nconcentrated on it. But ill–fortune may dog any one, and the same state\r\nof affairs seems to have led to one of the scribes getting the words\r\ndown wrong. Instead of _revendication_ which means _demand_, the word\r\n_renonciation_ which means _concession_ got written in the text handed\r\nto the Germans for signature.[101] This word was not so suitable. But\r\nM. Klotz suffered less inconvenience from this mistake than might have\r\nbeen expected; since at the Peace Conference no one noticed that the\r\nFrench text of the Armistice Agreement as officially circulated, which\r\nM. Klotz used in arguing before the Reparation Committee, agreed in its\r\nwording with what he had intended it to be and not with the text which\r\nGermany had actually signed. Nevertheless it is the word _renonciation_\r\nwhich is still to be found in the official texts of the British and\r\nGerman Governments.[102]\r\n\r\n2. The other line of argument raises more subtle intellectual issues\r\nand is not a mere matter of prestidigitation. If it be granted that\r\nour rights are governed by the terms of the Note addressed to Germany\r\nby President Wilson in the name of the Allies on November 5, 1918, the\r\nquestion depends on the interpretation of these terms. As Mr. Baruch\r\nand M. Tardieu have now published between them the greater part of\r\nthe official reports (including very secret documents) bearing on the\r\ndiscussion of this problem during the Peace Conference, we are in a\r\nbetter position than before to assess the value of the Allies’ case.\r\n\r\nThe pronouncements by the President which were to form the basis of\r\nPeace provided that there should be “no contributions” and “no punitive\r\ndamages,” but the invaded territories of Belgium, France, Rumania,\r\nSerbia, and Montenegro were to be restored. This did not cover losses\r\nfrom submarines or from air raids. Accordingly the Allied Governments,\r\nwhen they accepted the President’s formulas, embodied a reservation,\r\non the point as to what “restoration” covered, in the following\r\nsentence: “By _it_ (_i.e._, restoration of invaded territory) they\r\nunderstand that compensation will be made by Germany for all damage\r\ndone to the civilian population of the Allies and to their property by\r\nthe aggression of Germany by land, by sea, and from the air.”\r\n\r\nThe natural meaning and object of these words, which, the reader\r\nmust remember, are introduced as an interpretation of the phrase\r\n“restoration of invaded territory,” is to assimilate submarine and\r\ncruiser aggression by sea and aeroplane and airship aggression by air\r\nto military aggression by land, which, in all the circumstances, was\r\na reasonable extension of the phrase, provided it was duly notified\r\nbeforehand. The Allies rightly apprehended that, if they accepted the\r\nphrase as it stood, “restoration of invaded territory” might be limited\r\nto damage resulting from military aggression by land.\r\n\r\nThis interpretation of the reservation of the Allied Governments,\r\nnamely that it assimilated offensive action by sea or air to offensive\r\naction by land, but that “restoration of invaded territory” could not\r\npossibly include pensions and separation allowances, was adopted by the\r\nAmerican Delegation at Paris. They construed the German liability to be\r\nin respect of the “direct physical damage to property of non–military\r\ncharacter and direct physical injury to civilians”[103] caused by such\r\naggression; the only further liability which they admitted being under\r\na different part of the President’s pronouncements, namely, those\r\nrelating to breaches of International law, such as the breach of the\r\nTreaty of Neutrality in favor of Belgium, and the illegal treatment of\r\nprisoners of war.\r\n\r\nI doubt if any one would ever have challenged this interpretation\r\nif the British Prime Minister had not won a General Election by\r\npromises to extract from Germany more than this interpretation could\r\njustify,[104] and if the French Government also had not raised\r\nunjustifiable expectations. These promises were made recklessly. But it\r\nwas not easy for their authors to admit, so soon after they had been\r\ngiven, that they were contrary to our engagements.\r\n\r\nThe discussion opened with the delegations, other than the American,\r\nclaiming that we had not committed ourselves to anything which\r\nprecluded our demanding from Germany all the loss and damage, direct\r\nand indirect, which had resulted from the war. “One of the Allies,”\r\nsays Mr. Baruch, “went even further, and made claim for loss and\r\ndamage resulting from the fact that the Armistice was concluded so\r\nunexpectedly that the termination of hostilities involved it in\r\nfinancial losses.”\r\n\r\nVarious arguments were employed in the early stages, the British\r\ndelegates to the Reparation Committee of the Peace Conference, namely,\r\nMr. Hughes, Lord Sumner and Lord Cunliffe, supporting the demand for\r\ncomplete war costs and not merely reparation for damage. They urged\r\n(1) that one of the principles enunciated by President Wilson was that\r\neach item of the Treaty should be just, and that it was in accordance\r\nwith the general principles of justice to throw on Germany the whole\r\ncosts of the war; and (2) that Great Britain’s war costs had resulted\r\nfrom Germany’s breach of the Treaty of Neutrality of Belgium, and that\r\ntherefore Great Britain (but not necessarily, on this argument, all the\r\nother Allies) was entitled to complete repayment in accordance with the\r\ngeneral principles of International law. These general arguments were,\r\nI think, overwhelmed by the speeches made on behalf of the American\r\ndelegates by Mr. John Foster Dulles. The following are extracts from\r\nwhat he said: “If it is in accordance with our sentiment that the\r\nprinciples of reparation be severe, and in accord with our material\r\ninterest that these principles be all inclusive, why, in defiance of\r\nthese motives, have we proposed reparation in certain limited ways\r\nonly? It is because, gentlemen, we do not regard ourselves as free. We\r\nare not here to consider as a novel proposal what reparation the enemy\r\nshould in justice pay; we have not before us a blank page upon which\r\nwe are free to write what we will. We have before us a page, it is\r\ntrue; but one which is already filled with writing, and at the bottom\r\nare the signatures of Mr. Wilson, of Mr. Orlando, of M. Clemenceau,\r\nand of Mr. Lloyd George. You are all aware, I am sure, of the writing\r\nto which I refer: it is the agreed basis of peace with Germany.”\r\nMr. Dulles then recapitulated the relevant passages and continued:\r\n“Can there be any question that this agreement does constitute a\r\nlimitation? It is perfectly obvious that it was recognized at the time\r\nof the negotiations in October and November 1918 that the reparation\r\nthen specified for would limit the Associated Governments as to the\r\nreparation which they could demand of the enemy as a condition of\r\npeace. The whole purpose of Germany was to ascertain the maximum which\r\nwould be demanded of her in the terms of peace, and the action of the\r\nAllies in especially stipulating at that time, for an enlargement of\r\nthe original proposal respecting reparation is explicable only on the\r\ntheory that it was understood that once an agreement was concluded\r\nthey would no longer be free to specify the reparation which Germany\r\nmust make. We have thus agreed that we would give Germany peace if\r\nshe would do certain specified things. Is it now open to us to say,\r\n‘Yes, but before you get peace you must do other and further things’?\r\nWe have said to Germany, ‘You may have peace if among other things\r\nyou perform certain acts of reparation which will cost you, say, ten\r\nmillion dollars.’ Are we not now clearly precluded from saying, ‘You\r\ncan have peace provided you perform other acts of reparation which will\r\nbring your total liability to many times that which was originally\r\nstipulated’? No; irrespective of the justice of the enemy making the\r\nlatter reparation, it is now too late. Our bargain has been struck for\r\nbetter or for worse; it remains only to give it a fair construction and\r\npractical application.”\r\n\r\nIt is a shameful memory that the British delegates never withdrew their\r\nfull demands, to which they were still adhering when, in March 1921,\r\nthe question was taken out of their hands by the Supreme Council. The\r\nAmerican Delegation cabled to the President, who was then at sea,\r\nfor support in maintaining their position, to which he replied that\r\nthe American Delegation should dissent, and if necessary dissent\r\npublicly, from a procedure which “is clearly inconsistent with what\r\nwe deliberately led the enemy to expect and cannot now honorably alter\r\nsimply because we have the power.”[105]\r\n\r\nAfter this the discussions entered on a new phase. The British and\r\nFrench Prime Ministers abandoned the contentions of their delegates,\r\nadmitted the binding force of the words contained in their Note of\r\nNovember 5, 1918, and settled down to extract some meaning from\r\nthese words which would compose their differences and satisfy\r\ntheir constituents. What constituted “damage done to the civilian\r\npopulation”? Could not this be made to cover military pensions and the\r\nseparation allowances which had been made to the civilian dependents\r\nof soldiers? If so, the bill against Germany could be raised to a\r\nhigh enough figure to satisfy nearly every one. It was pointed out,\r\nhowever, as Mr. Baruch records, “that financial loss resulting from the\r\nabsence of a wage–earner did not cause any more ‘damage to the civilian\r\npopulation’ than did an equal financial loss involved in the payment\r\nof taxes to provide military equipment and like war costs.” In fact,\r\na separation allowance or a pension was simply one of many general\r\ncharges on the Exchequer arising out of the costs of the war. If such\r\ncharges were to be admitted as civilian damage, it was a very short\r\nstep back to the claim for the entire costs of the war, on the ground\r\nthat these costs must fall on the taxpayer who, generally speaking, was\r\na civilian. The sophistry of the argument became exposed by pushing it\r\nto its logical conclusion. Nor was it clear how pensions and allowances\r\ncould be covered by words which were themselves an interpretation of\r\nthe phrase, “restoration of invaded territory.” And the President’s\r\nconscience, though very desirous by now to be converted (for he had on\r\nhand other controversies with his colleagues which interested him more\r\nthan this one) remained unconvinced.\r\n\r\nThe American delegates have recorded that the final argument which\r\noverbore the last scruples of the President was contained in a\r\nMemorandum prepared by General Smuts[106] on March 31, 1919. Briefly,\r\nthis argument was, that a soldier becomes a civilian again after his\r\ndischarge, and that, therefore, a wound, the effects of which persist\r\nafter he has left the Army, is damage done to a civilian.[107] This is\r\nthe argument by which “damage done to the civilian population” came to\r\ninclude damage done to soldiers. This is the argument on which, in the\r\nend, our case was based! For at this straw the President’s conscience\r\nclutched, and the matter was settled.\r\n\r\nIt had been settled in the privacy of the Four. I will give the final\r\nscene in the words of Mr. Lamont, one of the American delegates:[108]\r\n\r\n “I well remember the day upon which President Wilson determined to\r\n support the inclusion of pensions in the Reparation Bill. Some of us\r\n were gathered in his library in the Place des États Unis, having been\r\n summoned by him to discuss this particular question of pensions. We\r\n explained to him that we couldn’t find a single lawyer in the American\r\n Delegation that would give an opinion in favor of including pensions.\r\n All the logic was against it. ‘Logic! logic!’ exclaimed the President,\r\n ‘I don’t care a damn for logic. I am going to include pensions!’”[109]\r\n\r\nWell! perhaps I was too near these things at the time and have\r\nbecome touched in the emotions, but I cannot “more or less shrug my\r\nshoulders.” Whether or not that is the appropriate gesture, I have here\r\nset forth, for the inspection of Englishmen and our Allies, the moral\r\nbasis on which two–thirds of our claims against Germany rest.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[93] I have given the exact text of the relevant passages in _The\r\nEconomic Consequences of the Peace_, chapter v.\r\n\r\n[94] _The Truth about the Treaty_, p. 208.\r\n\r\n[95] _E.g._, _The History of the Peace Conference of Paris_, published\r\nunder the auspices of the Institute of International Affairs delivers\r\njudgment as follows (vol. ii., p. 43): “It is this statement then\r\n(_i.e._, President Wilson’s notification of Nov. 5, 1918) which must be\r\ntaken as the ruling document in any discussion as to what the Allies\r\nwere entitled to claim by way of reparation in the Treaty of Peace,\r\nand it is difficult to interpret it otherwise than as a deliberate\r\nlimitation of their undoubted right to recover the whole of their war\r\ncosts.”\r\n\r\n[96] The following particulars are taken from _Les Négociations\r\nSecrètes et les Quatre Armistices avec pièces justificatives_ by\r\n“Mermeix,” published at Paris by Ollendorff, 1921. This remarkable\r\nvolume has not received the attention it deserves. The greater part of\r\nit consists of a verbatim transcript of the secret _Procès Verbaux_\r\nof those meetings of the Supreme Council of the Allies which were\r\nconcerned with the Armistice Terms. On the face of it this disclosure\r\nis authentic and is corroborated in part by M. Tardieu. There are many\r\npassages of extraordinary interest on points not connected with my\r\npresent topic, as for example the discussion of the question whether\r\nthe Allies should insist on the surrender of the German fleet if the\r\nGermans made trouble about it. Marshal Foch emerges from this record\r\nvery honorably, as determined that nothing unnecessary should be\r\ndemanded of the enemy, and that no blood should be spilt for a vain or\r\ntrifling object. Sir Douglas Haig was of the same opinion. In reply to\r\nCol. House, Foch spoke thus: “If they accept the terms of the Armistice\r\nwe are imposing on them, it is a capitulation. Such a capitulation\r\ngives us everything we could get from the greatest victory. In such\r\ncircumstances I cannot admit that I have the right to risk the life of\r\na single man more.” And again on October 31: “If our conditions are\r\naccepted we can wish for nothing better. We make war only to attain\r\nour ends, and we do not want to prolong it uselessly.” In reply to\r\na proposal by Mr. Balfour that the Germans in evacuating the East\r\nshould leave one–third of their arms behind them, Foch observed: “The\r\nintrusion of all these clauses makes our document chimerical, since\r\nthe greater part of the conditions are incapable of being executed.\r\nWe should do well to be sparing with these unrealizable injunctions.”\r\nTowards Austria also he was humane and feared the prolongation of the\r\nblockade which the politicians were proposing. “I intervene,” he said\r\non October 31, 1918, “in a matter which is not a military one strictly\r\nspeaking. We are to maintain the blockade until Peace, that is to say\r\nuntil we have made a new Austria. That may take a long time; which\r\nmeans a country condemned to famine and perhaps impelled to anarchy.”\r\n\r\n[97] This is corroborated by M. Tardieu, _op. cit._, p. 71.\r\n\r\n[98] See Mermeix, _op. cit._, pp. 226–250.\r\n\r\n[99] This very important remark by Mr. Bonar Law is also quoted by M.\r\nTardieu (_op. cit._, p. 70) and is therefore of undoubted authenticity.\r\n\r\n[100] “Il serait prudent de mettre en tête des questions financières\r\nune clause réservant les revendications futures des Alliés et je vous\r\npropose le texte suivant: ‘Sous réserve de toutes revendications et\r\nréclamations ultérieures de la part des Alliés.’”\r\n\r\n[101] That is to say, this text ran, “Sous réserve de toute\r\nrenonciation et réclamation ultérieure,” instead of “Sous réserve de\r\ntoutes revendications et réclamations ultérieures.”\r\n\r\n[102] I record this episode as an historical curiosity. In my opinion\r\nit makes no material difference to the argument whether the text runs\r\n“revendications et réclamations” or “renonciation et réclamation”;\r\nfor I regard either form of words as merely a protective phrase. But\r\nthe plausibility of M. Klotz’s position is decidedly weakened (if\r\nso weak a case is capable of further weakening) if it is the latter\r\nphrase which is authentic. The Editor of the Institute of International\r\nAffairs’ _History of the Peace Conference of Paris_, who was the first\r\nto discover and publish the discrepancy in question (vol. v., pp.\r\n370–372), takes the view that the question of which text is used makes\r\na material difference to the value of M. Klotz’s argument.\r\n\r\n[103] Baruch, _op. cit._, p. 19.\r\n\r\n[104] As Mr. Baruch puts it (_op. cit._, p. 4): “At an election held\r\n_after the Armistice and agreement as to the basic terms of peace_, the\r\nEnglish people, by an overwhelming majority, returned to power their\r\nPrime Minister _on the basis of an increase in the severity of these\r\nterms of the peace_, especially those of reparation.” (The italics are\r\nmine.)\r\n\r\n[105] Baruch, _op. cit._, p. 25.\r\n\r\n[106] This Memorandum, which has been published _in extenso_ by Mr.\r\nBaruch (_op. cit._, p. 29 _seq._), belonged to the category of most\r\nsecret documents. It has been given to the world by itself without the\r\naccompanying circumstances which, without justifying its arguments\r\n(on which indeed no further light could be thrown beyond what we\r\nalready have in the narrative of Mr. Baruch), might yet throw light on\r\nindividual motives. I agree with the comment made by _The Economist_\r\n(Oct. 22, 1921) in reviewing Vol. IV. of the _History of the Peace\r\nConference of Paris_ (published under the auspices of the Institute\r\nof International Affairs), which has reprinted this Memorandum, that\r\n“a very serious injustice will be done to the reputation of General\r\nSmuts if this document continues to be reproduced and circulated\r\nwithout any explanation of the circumstances in which it was prepared.”\r\nNevertheless it is well that the world should have this document, and\r\nit must take its place in a story which is more important to the world\r\nthan the motives and reputations of individual actors in it.\r\n\r\n[107] The following is the salient passage of the Memorandum: “After\r\nthe soldier’s discharge as unfit he rejoins the civilian population,\r\nand as for the future he cannot (in whole or in part) earn his own\r\nlivelihood, he is suffering damage as a member of the civilian\r\npopulation, for which the German Government are again liable to make\r\ncompensation. In other words, the pension for disablement which he\r\ndraws from the French Government is really a liability of the German\r\nGovernment, which they must under the above reservation make good to\r\nthe French Government. It could not be argued that as he was disabled\r\nwhile a soldier he does not suffer damage as a civilian after his\r\ndischarge if he is unfit to do his ordinary work. He does literally\r\nsuffer as civilian after his discharge, and his pension is intended\r\nto make good this damage, and is therefore a liability of the German\r\nGovernment.”\r\n\r\n[108] _What Really Happened at Paris_, p. 272.\r\n\r\n[109] Mr. Lamont adds that “it was not a contempt of logic, but\r\nsimply an impatience of technicality; a determination to brush aside\r\nverbiage and get at the root of things. There was not one of us in the\r\nroom whose heart did not beat with a like feeling.” These words not\r\nmerely reflect a little naïvely the modern opportunist’s impatience\r\nof legality and respect for the _fait accompli_, but also recall the\r\natmosphere of exhaustion and the longing of everyone to be finished,\r\nsomehow, with this dreadful controversy, which for months had outraged\r\nat the same time the intellects and the consciences of most of the\r\nparticipators. Yet, even so, to their lasting credit, the American\r\nDelegation had stood firm for the law, and it was the President, and he\r\nalone, who capitulated to the lying exigencies of politics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n         REPARATION, INTER–ALLY DEBT, AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is fashionable at the present time to urge a reduction of the\r\nAllies’ claims on Germany and of America’s claims on the Allies, on the\r\nground that, as such payments can only be made in goods, insistence on\r\nthese claims will be positively injurious to the claimants.\r\n\r\nThat it is in the self–interest of the Allies and of America to abate\r\ntheir respective demands, I hold to be true. But it is better not to\r\nuse bad arguments, and the suggestion that it is necessarily injurious\r\nto receive goods for nothing is not plausible or correct. I seek in\r\nthis chapter to disentangle the true from the false in the now popular\r\nbelief that there is something harmful in compelling Germany (or\r\nEurope) to “fling goods at us.”\r\n\r\nThe argument is a little intricate and the reader must be patient.\r\n\r\n1. It does not make very much difference whether the debtor country\r\npays by sending goods direct to the creditor or by selling them\r\nelsewhere and remitting cash. In either case the goods come on to the\r\nworld market and are sold competitively or coöperatively in relation to\r\nthe industries of the creditor, as the case may be, this distinction\r\ndepending on the nature of the goods rather than on the market in which\r\nthey are sold.\r\n\r\n2. It is not much use to _earmark_ non–competitive goods against the\r\npayment of the debt, so long as competitive goods are being sold by the\r\ndebtor country in some other connection, _e.g._, to pay for its own\r\nimports. This is simply to bury one’s head in the sand. For example,\r\nout of the aggregate of goods which Germany would naturally export\r\nin the event of her exports being forcibly stimulated, it might be\r\npossible to pick out a selection of non–competitive goods; but it would\r\nnot affect the situation in the slightest degree to pretend that it was\r\nthese particular goods, and not the others, which were paying the debt.\r\nIt is therefore useless to prescribe that Germany shall pay in certain\r\nspecified commodities if these are commodities which she would export\r\nin any case, and useless, equally, to forbid her to pay in certain\r\nspecified commodities, if that merely means that she will export these\r\ncommodities to some other market to pay for her imports generally. No\r\nexpedient on our part for making Germany pay us, or on America’s part\r\nfor making us pay her, in the shape of particular commodities affects\r\nthe position, except in so far as it modifies the form of the paying\r\ncountry’s exports _as a whole_.\r\n\r\n3. On the other hand, it does us no harm to receive for nothing the\r\nproceeds of goods, even when they are sold competitively, if these\r\ngoods would be sold on the world’s market in any case.\r\n\r\n4. If the result of pressing the debtor country to pay is to cause it\r\nto offer competitive goods at a lower price than it would otherwise,\r\nthe particular industries in the creditor country which produce these\r\ngoods are bound to suffer, even though there are balancing advantages\r\nfor the creditor country as a whole.\r\n\r\n5. In so far as the payments made by the debtor country accrue, not to\r\nthe country with which the debtor’s goods are competing, but to a third\r\nparty, clearly there are no balancing advantages to offset the direct\r\ndisadvantages under 4.\r\n\r\n6. The answer to the question, whether the balancing advantages to\r\nthe creditor country as a whole outweigh the injury to particular\r\nindustries within that country, depends on the length of the period\r\nover which the creditor country can reasonably expect to go on\r\nreceiving the payments. At first the injury to the industries which\r\nsuffer from the competition and to those employed in them is likely to\r\noutweigh the benefit of the payments received. But, as in the course of\r\ntime the capital and labor are absorbed in other directions, a balance\r\nof advantage may accrue.\r\n\r\nThe application of these general principles to the particular case of\r\nourselves and Germany is easy. Germany’s exports are so preponderantly\r\ncompetitive with ours, that, if her exports are forcibly stimulated,\r\nit is certain that she will have to sell goods against us. This is not\r\naltered by the fact that it is possible to pick out a few exports or\r\npotential exports, such as potash or sugar, which are not competitive.\r\nIf Germany is to have a _large_ surplus of exports over imports, she\r\nmust increase her competitive sales. In the _Economic Consequences of\r\nthe Peace_ (pp. 175–185) I demonstrated this at some length on the\r\nbasis of pre–war statistics. I showed not only that the goods she must\r\nsell, but the markets she must sell them in, were largely competitive\r\nwith our own. The statistics of post–war trade show that the former\r\nargument still holds good. The following table shows the proportions in\r\nwhich her export trade was divided between the principal articles of\r\nexport, (1) in 1913, (2) in the first nine months of 1920 (the latest\r\nperiod for which I have figures in this precise form), and (3) in the\r\nfour months June to September 1921, these last figures representing, I\r\nthink, a not exactly comparable classification, and being provisional\r\nonly:\r\n\r\n  ──────────────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────\r\n                                    │   Percentage of Total Exports.\r\n        German Exports.             ├───────┬────────────┬─────────────\r\n                                    │ 1913. │   1920     │    1921\r\n                                    │       │(Jan.─Sept.)│ (June─Sept.)\r\n  ──────────────────────────────────┼───────┼────────────┼─────────────\r\n  Iron and steel goods              │ 13.2  │    20      │     22\r\n  Machinery (including motor cars)  │  7.5  │    12      │     17\r\n  Chemicals and dies                │  4    │    13      │      9.5\r\n  Fuel                              │  7    │     6.5    │      ?\r\n  Paper goods                       │  2.5  │     4      │      3.5\r\n  Electrical goods                  │  2    │     3.5    │      ?\r\n  Silk goods                        │  2    │     3      │}\r\n  Cotton goods                      │  5.5  │     3      │}    15\r\n  Woolen goods                      │  6    │    ..      │}\r\n  Glass                             │   .5  │     2.5    │      2\r\n  Leather goods                     │  3    │     2      │      4\r\n  Copper goods                      │  1.5  │     1.5    │      ?\r\n  ──────────────────────────────────┴───────┴────────────┴─────────────\r\n\r\nIt is clear, therefore, that, though raw materials other than coal,\r\nsuch as potash, sugar, and timber may yield a trifle, Germany can only\r\ncompass an export trade of great value by exporting iron and steel\r\ngoods, chemicals, dyes, textiles, and coal, for these are the only\r\nexport articles of which she can produce great quantities. It is also\r\nclear that there have been no very marked changes in the proportionate\r\nimportance of the different export trades since the war, except that\r\nthe exchange position has somewhat stimulated, relatively to the\r\nothers, those export lines, such as iron goods, machinery, chemicals,\r\ndyes, and glass, which do not involve much importation of raw materials.\r\n\r\nTo compel Germany to pay a large indemnity is therefore the same thing\r\nas to compel her to expand some or all of the above–mentioned exports\r\nto a greater extent than she would do otherwise. The only way in which\r\nshe can effect this expansion is by offering the goods at a lower price\r\nthan that at which other countries care to offer them; putting herself\r\nin a position to offer them cheap, partly by the German working classes\r\nlowering their standard of life without reducing their efficiency\r\nin the same degree, and partly by German _export_ industries being\r\nsubsidized, directly or indirectly, at the expense of the rest of the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nThese facts, formerly overlooked, are now, perhaps, exaggerated\r\nby popular opinion. For Principle (3), enunciated above, requires\r\nattention. Our industries will be subjected to strong competition\r\nfrom Germany, just as they were before the war, whether we exact\r\nReparation or not; and we must not ascribe to the Reparation policy\r\ninconveniences which would exist in any case. The remedy lies not in\r\nthe now popular nostrums for prescribing the _form_ in which Germany\r\nshall pay, but in reducing the aggregate _amount_ to a reasonable\r\nfigure. For by prescribing the manner in which she shall pay _us_ we do\r\nnot control the form of her export trade as a whole; and by absorbing\r\nfor reparation purposes the whole of a particular type of export, we\r\ncompel her to expand her other exports to pay for her imports and\r\nother international obligations. On the other hand, we can secure\r\nfrom her moderate payments, on the sort of scale, for example, on\r\nwhich she might have been building up new foreign investments, without\r\nstimulating her exports as a whole to a greater activity than they\r\nwould enjoy otherwise. This is the correct course for Great Britain\r\nfrom the standpoint of her own self–interest only.\r\n\r\nThe practical application of Principles (5) and (6) is also clear. So\r\nfar as (5) is concerned, Great Britain is to receive not the whole\r\nof the indemnity, but about a fifth of it; whilst (6) provides the\r\nargument which to me has always appeared decisive. The _permanence_ of\r\nreparation payments on a large scale for a long period of years is,\r\nto say the least, not to be reckoned on. Who believes that the Allies\r\nwill, over a period of one or two generations, exert adequate force\r\nover the German Government, or that the German Government can exert\r\nadequate authority over its subjects, to extract continuing fruits on a\r\nvast scale from forced labor? No one believes it in his heart; no one\r\nat all. There is not the faintest possibility of our persisting with\r\nthis affair to the end. But if this is so, then, most certainly, it\r\nwill not be worth our while to disorder our export trades and disturb\r\nthe equilibrium of our industry for two or three years; much less to\r\nendanger the peace of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe same principles apply with one modification to the United States\r\nand to the exaction by her of the debts which the Allied Governments\r\nowe. The industries of the United States would suffer, not so much from\r\nthe competition of cheap goods from the Allies in their endeavors to\r\npay their debts, as from the inability of the Allies to purchase from\r\nAmerica their usual proportion of her exports. The Allies would have\r\nto find the money to pay America, not so much by selling more as by\r\nbuying less. The farmers of the United States would suffer more than\r\nthe manufacturers; if only because increased imports can be kept out by\r\na tariff, whilst there is no such easy way of stimulating diminished\r\nexports. It is, however, a curious fact that whilst Wall Street and\r\nthe manufacturing East are prepared to consider a modification of the\r\ndebts, the Middle West and South is reported (I write ignorantly) to be\r\ndead against it. For two years Germany was not required to pay cash to\r\nthe Allies, and during that period the manufacturers of Great Britain\r\nwere quite blind to what the consequences would be to themselves when\r\nthe payments actually began. The Allies have not yet been required to\r\nbegin to pay cash to the United States, and the farmers of the latter\r\nare still as blind as were the British manufacturers to the injuries\r\nthey will suffer if the Allies ever try seriously to pay in full. I\r\nrecommend Senators and Congressmen from the agricultural districts\r\nof the United States, lest they soon suffer the same moral and\r\nintellectual ignominy as our own high–Reparation men, to invest at once\r\nin a little caution in their opposition to the efforts of Mr. Harding’s\r\nAdministration to secure for itself a free hand to act wisely in this\r\nmatter (and even perhaps generously) in accordance with the progress of\r\nopinion and of events.\r\n\r\nThe decisive argument, however, for the United States, as for Great\r\nBritain, is not the damage to particular interests (which would\r\ndiminish with time), but the unlikelihood of permanence in the exaction\r\nof the debts, even if they were paid for a short period. I say this,\r\nnot only because I doubt the ability of the European Allies to pay, but\r\nbecause of the great difficulty of the problem which the United States\r\nhas before her in any case in balancing her commercial account with the\r\nOld World.\r\n\r\nAmerican economists have examined somewhat carefully the statistical\r\nmeasure of the change from the pre–war position. According to their\r\nestimates, America is now owed more interest on foreign investments\r\nthan is due from her, quite apart from the interest on the debts of\r\nthe Allied Governments; and her mercantile marine now earns from\r\nforeigners more than she owes them for similar services. Her excess\r\nof exports of commodities over imports approaches $3000 millions a\r\nyear;[110] whilst, on the other side of the balance, payments, mainly\r\nto Europe, in respect of tourists and of immigrant remittances are\r\nestimated at not above $1000 millions a year. Thus, in order to balance\r\nthe account as it now stands, the United States must lend to the rest\r\nof the world, in one shape or another, not less than $2000 millions a\r\nyear, to which interest and sinking fund on the European Governmental\r\nWar Debts would, if they were paid, add about $600 millions.\r\n\r\nRecently, therefore, the United States must have been lending to the\r\nrest of the world, mainly Europe, something like $2000 millions a\r\nyear. Fortunately for Europe, a fair proportion of this was by way of\r\nspeculative purchases of depreciated paper currencies. From 1919 to\r\n1921 the losses of American speculators fed Europe; but this source of\r\nincome can scarcely be reckoned on permanently. For a time the policy\r\nof loans can meet the situation; but, as the interest on past loans\r\nmounts up, it must in the long run aggravate it.\r\n\r\nMercantile nations have always employed large funds in overseas trade.\r\nBut the practice of foreign investment, as we know it now, is a very\r\nmodern contrivance, a very unstable one, and only suited to peculiar\r\ncircumstances. An old country can in this way develop a new one at a\r\ntime when the latter could not possibly do so with its own resources\r\nalone; the arrangement may be mutually advantageous, and out of\r\nabundant profits the lender may hope to be repaid. But the position\r\ncannot be reversed. If European bonds are issued in America on the\r\nanalogy of the American bonds issued in Europe during the nineteenth\r\ncentury, the analogy will be a false one; because, taken in the\r\naggregate, there is no natural increase, no _real_ sinking fund, out\r\nof which they can be repaid. The interest will be furnished out of new\r\nloans, so long as these are obtainable, and the financial structure\r\nwill mount always higher, until it is not worth while to maintain any\r\nlonger the illusion that it has foundations. The unwillingness of\r\nAmerican investors to buy European bonds is based on common sense.\r\n\r\nAt the end of 1919 I advocated (in _The Economic Consequences of the\r\nPeace_) a reconstruction loan from America to Europe, conditioned,\r\nhowever, on Europe’s putting her own house in order. In the past\r\ntwo years America, in spite of European complaints to the contrary,\r\nhas, in fact, made _very large_ loans, much larger than the sum I\r\ncontemplated, though not mainly in the form of regular, dollar–bond\r\nissues. No particular conditions were attached to these loans, and\r\nmuch of the money has been lost. Though wasted in part, they have\r\nhelped Europe through the critical days of the post–Armistice period.\r\nBut a continuance of them cannot provide a solution for the existing\r\ndisequilibrium in the balance of indebtedness.\r\n\r\nIn part the adjustment may be effected by the United States taking the\r\nplace hitherto held by England, France, and (on a small scale) Germany\r\nin providing capital for those new parts of the world less developed\r\nthan herself—the British Dominions and South America. The Russian\r\nEmpire, too, in Europe and Asia, may be regarded as virgin soil, which\r\nwill at a later date provide a suitable outlet for foreign capital.\r\nThe American investor will lend more wisely to these countries, on the\r\nlines on which British and French investors used to lend to them, than\r\ndirect to the old countries of Europe. But it is not likely that the\r\nwhole gap can be bridged thus. Ultimately, and probably soon, there\r\nmust be a readjustment of the balance of exports and imports. America\r\nmust buy more and sell less. This is the only alternative to her\r\nmaking to Europe an annual present. Either American prices must rise\r\nfaster than European (which will be the case if the Federal Reserve\r\nBoard allows the gold influx to produce its natural consequences),\r\nor, failing this, the same result must be brought about by a further\r\ndepreciation of the European exchanges, until Europe, by inability\r\nto buy, has reduced her purchases to articles of necessity. At first\r\nthe American exporter, unable to scrap all at once the processes of\r\nproduction for export, may meet the situation by lowering his prices;\r\nbut when these have continued, say for two years, below his cost of\r\nproduction, he will be driven inevitably to curtail or abandon his\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nIt is useless for the United States to suppose that an equilibrium\r\nposition can be reached on the basis of her exporting at least as\r\nmuch as at present, and at the same time restricting her imports by\r\na tariff. Just as the Allies demand vast payments from Germany, and\r\nthen exercise their ingenuity to prevent her paying them, so the\r\nAmerican Administration devises, with one hand, schemes for financing\r\nexports, and, with the other, tariffs which will make it as difficult\r\nas possible for such credits to be repaid. Great nations can often act\r\nwith a degree of folly which we should not excuse in an individual.\r\n\r\nBy the shipment to the United States of all the bullion in the\r\nworld, and the erection there of a sky–scraping golden calf, a short\r\npostponement may be gained. But a point may even come when the United\r\nStates will refuse gold, yet still demand to be paid,—a new Midas\r\nvainly asking more succulent fare than the barren metal of her own\r\ncontract.\r\n\r\nIn any case the readjustment will be severe, and injurious to important\r\ninterests. If, in addition, the United States exacts payment of the\r\nAllied debts, the position will be intolerable. If she persevered\r\nto the bitter end, scrapped her export industries and diverted to\r\nother uses the capital now employed in them, and if her former\r\nEuropean associates decided to meet their obligations at whatever\r\ncost to themselves, I do not deny that the final result might be to\r\nAmerica’s material interest. But the project is utterly chimerical.\r\nIt will not happen. Nothing is more certain than that America will\r\nnot pursue such a policy to its conclusion; she will abandon it as\r\nsoon as she experiences its first consequences. Nor, if she did, would\r\nthe Allies pay the money. The position is exactly parallel to that\r\nof German Reparation. America will not carry through to a conclusion\r\nthe collection of Allied debt, any more than the Allies will carry\r\nthrough the collection of their present Reparation demands. Neither, in\r\nthe long run, is serious politics. Nearly all well–informed persons\r\nadmit this in private conversation. But we live in a curious age when\r\nutterances in the press are deliberately designed to be in conformity\r\nwith the worst–informed, instead of with the best–informed, opinion,\r\nbecause the former is the wider spread; so that for comparatively long\r\nperiods there can be discrepancies, laughable or monstrous, between the\r\nwritten and the spoken word.\r\n\r\nIf this is so, it is not good business for America to embitter her\r\nrelations with Europe, and to disorder her export industries for two\r\nyears, in pursuance of a policy which she is certain to abandon before\r\nit has profited her.\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of any reader who enjoys an abstract statement,\r\nI summarize the argument thus. The equilibrium of international\r\ntrade is based on a complicated balance between the agriculture and\r\nthe industries of the different countries of the world, and on a\r\nspecialization by each in the employment of its labor and its capital.\r\nIf one country is required to transfer to another without payment\r\ngreat quantities of goods, for which this equilibrium does not allow,\r\nthe balance is destroyed. Since capital and labor are fixed and\r\norganized in certain employments and cannot flow freely into others,\r\nthe disturbance of the balance is destructive to the utility of the\r\ncapital and labor thus fixed. The _organization_, on which the wealth\r\nof the modern world so largely depends, suffers injury. In course of\r\ntime a new organization and a new equilibrium can be established.\r\nBut if the origin of the disturbance is of temporary duration, the\r\nlosses from the injury done to organization may outweigh the profit of\r\nreceiving goods without paying for them. Moreover, since the losses\r\nwill be concentrated on the capital and labor employed in particular\r\nindustries, they will provoke an outcry out of proportion to the injury\r\ninflicted on the community as a whole.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[110] In the year of boom to June 1920, on a total trade of $13,350\r\nmillions, the excess of exports over imports was $2870 millions. In\r\nthe year, partly one of depression, to June 1921, on a total trade of\r\n$10,150 millions, the excess of exports was $2860 millions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n        THE REVISION OF THE TREATY AND THE SETTLEMENT OF EUROPE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe deeper and the fouler the bogs into which Mr. Lloyd George leads\r\nus, the more credit is his for getting us out. He leads us in to\r\nsatisfy our desires; he leads us out to save our souls. He hands us\r\ndown the primrose path and puts out the bonfire just in time. Who, ever\r\nbefore, enjoyed the best of heaven and hell as we do?\r\n\r\nIn England, opinion has nearly completed its swing, and the Prime\r\nMinister is making ready to win a General Election on Forbidding\r\nGermany to Pay, Employment for Every one, and a Happier Europe for\r\nAll. Why not, indeed? But this Faustus of ours shakes too quickly his\r\nkaleidoscope of halos and hell–fire, for me to depict the hues as they\r\nmelt into one another. I shall do better to construct an independent\r\nsolution, which is _possible_ in the sense that nothing but a change in\r\nthe popular will is necessary to achieve it, hoping to influence this\r\nwill a little, but leaving it to those, whose business it is, to gage\r\nthe moment at which it will be safe to embroider such patterns on a\r\npolitical banner.\r\n\r\nIf I look back two years and read again what I wrote then, I see that\r\nperils which were ahead are now passed safely. The patience of the\r\ncommon people of Europe and the stability of its institutions have\r\nsurvived the worst shocks they will receive. Two years ago the Treaty,\r\nwhich outraged Justice, Mercy, and Wisdom, represented the momentary\r\nwill of the victorious countries. Would the victims be patient? Or\r\nwould they be driven by despair and privation to shake Society’s\r\nfoundations? We have the answer now. They have been patient. Nothing\r\nvery much has happened, except pain and injury to individuals. The\r\ncommunities of Europe are settling down to a new equilibrium. We are\r\nalmost ready to turn our minds from the avoidance of calamity to the\r\nrenewal of health.\r\n\r\nThere have been other influences besides that patience of the common\r\npeople which often before has helped Europe through worse evils. The\r\nactions of those in power have been wiser than their words. It is\r\nonly a slight exaggeration to say that no parts of the Peace Treaties\r\nhave been carried out, except those relating to frontiers and to\r\ndisarmament. Many of the misfortunes which I predicted as attendant\r\non the execution of the Reparation Chapter have not occurred, because\r\nno serious attempt has been made to execute it. And, whilst no one\r\ncan predict with what particular sauce the makers of the Treaty will\r\neat their words, there can no longer be any question of the actual\r\nenforcement of this Chapter. And there has been a third factor, not\r\nquite in accordance with expectations, paradoxical at first sight, but\r\nnatural, nevertheless, and concordant with past experience,—the fact\r\nthat it is in times of growing profits and not in times of growing\r\ndistress that the working classes stir themselves and threaten their\r\nmasters. When times are bad and poverty presses on them they sink back\r\nagain into a weary acquiescence. Great Britain and all Europe have\r\nlearned this in 1921. Was not the French Revolution rather due perhaps\r\nto the growing wealth of eighteenth–century France—for at that time\r\nFrance was the richest country in the world—than to the pressure of\r\ntaxation or the exactions of the old régime? It is the profiteer, not\r\nprivation, that makes man shake his chains.\r\n\r\nIn spite, therefore, of trade depression and disordered exchanges,\r\nEurope, under the surface, is much stabler and much healthier than\r\ntwo years ago. The disturbance of minds is less. The organization,\r\ndestroyed by war, has been partly restored; transport, except in\r\nEastern Europe, is largely repaired; there has been a good harvest,\r\neverywhere but in Russia, and raw materials are abundant. Great Britain\r\nand the United States and their markets overseas have suffered a\r\ncyclical fluctuation of trade prosperity of a greater amplitude than\r\never before; but there are indications that the worst point is passed.\r\n\r\nTwo obstacles remain. The Treaty, though unexecuted, is not revised.\r\nAnd that part of organization, which consists in currency regulation,\r\npublic finance, and the foreign exchanges, remains nearly as bad as\r\nit ever was. In most European countries there is still no proper\r\nbalance between the expenditure of the State and its income, so that\r\ninflation continues and the international values of their currencies\r\nare fluctuating and uncertain. The suggestions which follow are mainly\r\ndirected towards these problems.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSome contemporary plans for the reconstruction of Europe err in\r\nbeing too paternal or too complicated; also, sometimes, in being too\r\npessimistic. The patients need neither drugs nor surgery, but healthy\r\nand natural surroundings in which they can exert their own recuperative\r\npowers. Therefore a good plan must be in the main _negative_; it must\r\nconsist in getting rid of shackles, in simplifying the situation, in\r\ncanceling futile but injurious entanglements. At present every one is\r\nfaced by obligations which they cannot meet. Until the problem set to\r\nthe Finance Ministers of Europe is a _possible_ one, there can be\r\nlittle incentive to energy or to the exercise of skill. But if the\r\nsituation was made such that an insolvent country could have only\r\nitself to blame, then the highest integrity and the most accomplished\r\nfinancial technique would, in each separate country, have its chance. I\r\nseek by the proposals of this chapter, not to prescribe a solution, but\r\nto create a situation in which a solution is possible.\r\n\r\nIn their main substance, therefore, my suggestions are not novel. The\r\nnow familiar project of the cancelation, in part or in their entirety,\r\nof the Reparation and Inter–allied Debts, is a large and unavoidable\r\nfeature of them. But those who are not prepared for these measures must\r\nnot pretend to a serious interest in the Reconstruction of Europe.\r\n\r\nIn so far as such cancelation or abatement involves concessions by\r\nGreat Britain, an Englishman can write without embarrassment and with\r\nsome knowledge of the tendency of popular opinion in his own country.\r\nBut where concessions by the United States are concerned he is in more\r\ndifficulty. The attitude of a section of the American press furnishes\r\nan almost irresistible temptation to deal out the sort of humbug (or\r\ndiscrete half–truths) which are believed to promote cordiality between\r\nnations; it is easy and terribly respectable; and what is much worse,\r\nit may even do good where frankness would do harm. I pursue the\r\nopposite course, with a doubting and uneasy conscience, yet supported\r\n(not only in this chapter but throughout my book) by the hope, possibly\r\nsuperstitious, that openness does good in the long run, even when it\r\nmakes trouble at first.\r\n\r\nSo far, Reparation on a large scale has not been collected from\r\nGermany. So far, the Allies have not paid interest to the United States\r\non what they owe. Our present troubles, when they are not attributable\r\nto the after–effects of war and the cyclical depression of trade, are\r\ndue, therefore, not to the enforcement of these claims, but to the\r\nuncertainties of their possible enforcement. It follows, therefore,\r\nthat merely to put off the problem will do us no good. That is what we\r\nhave been doing for two years already. Even to reduce our Reparation\r\ndemands to Germany’s maximum actual capacity and really force her\r\nto pay them, might make matters worse than they are. To write down\r\ninter–ally debts by half and then try to collect them, would be an\r\naggravation, not a cure, of the existing difficulties. The solution,\r\ntherefore, must not be one which tries to extract the last theoretical\r\npenny from everybody; its main object must be to set the Finance\r\nMinisters of _every_ country a problem not incapable of wise solution\r\nover the next five years.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    I. _The Revision of the Treaty_\r\n\r\nThe Reparation Commission have assessed the Treaty claims at 138\r\nmilliard gold marks, of which 132 milliards are for pensions and\r\ndamage and 6 milliards for Belgian debt. They have not stated in what\r\nproportions the 132 milliards are divided between pensions and damages.\r\nMy own assessment of the Treaty claims (p. 131 above) is 110 milliards,\r\nof which 74 milliards are for pensions and allowances, 30 milliards for\r\ndamage and 6 milliards for Belgian debt.\r\n\r\nThe arguments of Chapter VI make it incumbent on those who are\r\nconvinced by them to abandon as dishonorable the claims to pensions and\r\nallowances. This reduces the claims to 36 milliards, a sum which it may\r\nnot be in our interest to exact in full, but which is probably within\r\nGermany’s theoretical capacity to pay.\r\n\r\nApart from clearing out of the way various clauses which are no longer\r\noperative or useful, and from terminating the occupation on conditions\r\nset forth below, I should limit my Revision of the Treaty to this\r\nsimple stroke of the pen. Let the present assessment of 138 milliard\r\ngold marks be replaced by 36 milliard gold marks.\r\n\r\nWe are strictly entitled under the Armistice Terms to these 36\r\nmilliards; and if prudence recommends an abatement below that figure,\r\nsuch abatement can properly be made, on terms, by those and those only\r\nwho are entitled to the claims. I estimate with some confidence that\r\nthis sum of 36 milliards is divisible between the Allies about in the\r\nproportions shown in the table below.\r\n\r\nThe payment by Germany of 5 per cent interest and 1 per cent sinking\r\nfund on this total sum is not, in my judgment, theoretically\r\nimpossible. But it could only be done by stimulating her export\r\nindustries in a manner injurious and irritating to Great Britain, and\r\nby imposing on her Treasury a financial problem of such difficulty that\r\nit would tend to unsound finance and to weak, unstable Governments.\r\nEven though this payment is theoretically possible, I do not think that\r\nit is practically obtainable over a period of thirty years.\r\n\r\n  ────────────────┬───────┬─────────────┬──────\r\n                  │Damage.│Belgian Debt.│Total.\r\n  ────────────────┼───────┼─────────────┼──────\r\n  British Empire  │    9  │        2    │   11\r\n  France          │   16  │        2    │   18\r\n  Belgium         │    3  │       ..    │    3\r\n  Italy           │    1  │       ..    │    1\r\n  United States   │   ..  │        2    │    2\r\n  Others          │    1  │       ..    │    1\r\n                  ├───────┼─────────────┼──────\r\n                  │   30  │        6    │   36\r\n  ────────────────┴───────┴─────────────┴──────\r\n\r\nI recommend, therefore, that, as a separate arrangement from the\r\nRevision of the Treaty as above, the British Empire should waive the\r\nwhole of their claims, with the exception of 1 milliard gold marks\r\nreserved for a special purpose explained below, and should undertake\r\nto square the claims of Italy and the minor claimants by cancelation\r\nof debt owing from them; thus leaving Germany to pay 18 milliards to\r\nFrance and 3 milliards to Belgium (on the assumption that the United\r\nStates also would forego the trifle due to her). This sum should be\r\ndischarged by an annual payment of 6 per cent of the sum due (being\r\n5 per cent interest and 1 per cent sinking fund) over a period of\r\nthirty years. With the assistance of minor measures to ease the opening\r\nperiod, it is reasonable to suppose that this amount could be paid\r\nwithout serious injury to any one.\r\n\r\nIn so far as it proves convenient to discharge this liability in goods,\r\nand not in cash, so much the better. But I see no advantage in laying\r\nstress on this. It would be wiser to leave Germany to find the money as\r\nbest she can, any payment in goods being by mutual agreement, as in the\r\nWiesbaden plan.\r\n\r\nIt may lead, however, to great anomalies to fix the annual payments\r\nin terms of _gold_ over so long a period as thirty years. If gold\r\nprices fall, the burden may become intolerable. If gold prices rise,\r\nthe claimants may be cheated of their expectations. The annual payment\r\nshould be adjusted, therefore, by some impartial authority, with\r\nreference to an index number of the commodity–value of gold.\r\n\r\nThe other Treaty change relates to the Occupation. It would promote\r\npeaceable relations in Europe if, as a part of the new settlement, the\r\nAllied troops were withdrawn altogether from German territory, and all\r\nrights of invasion for whatever purpose waived, except by leave of a\r\nmajority vote of the League of Nations. But in return, the British\r\nEmpire and the United States should guarantee to France and Belgium\r\nall reasonable assistance, short of warfare, in securing satisfaction\r\nfor their reduced claims; whilst Germany should guarantee the complete\r\nde–militarization of her territory west of the Rhine.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 II. _The Satisfaction of the Allies_\r\n\r\n_France._—Is it in the interest of France to accept this settlement?\r\nIf it is combined with further concessions from Great Britain and\r\nthe United States by the cancelation of her debts to them, it is\r\noverwhelmingly in her interest.\r\n\r\nWhat is her present balance–sheet of claims and liabilities? She\r\nis entitled to 52 per cent of what Germany pays. On p. 75 I have\r\ncalculated what this will be under the London Settlement, (_a_) on\r\nthe basis of German exports at the rate of 6 milliards, namely 3.56\r\nmilliard gold marks; and (_b_) on the basis of exports at the rate\r\nof 10 milliards, namely 4.60 milliard gold marks. France’s share,\r\ntherefore, is 1.85 milliards per annum on assumption (_a_), and 2.39\r\nmilliards on assumption (_b_). On the other hand, she owes the United\r\nStates $3634 million and the United Kingdom £557 million. If these sums\r\nbe converted into gold marks at par, and the annual charge on them is\r\ncalculated at 5 per cent for interest and 1 per cent for sinking fund,\r\nher liability is 1.48 milliards per annum. That is to say, if Germany\r\npays in full and if the more favorable assumption (_b_) is adopted\r\nas to the growth of her exports, the most for which France can hope\r\nunder existing arrangements is a net sum of .91 milliard gold marks\r\n(£45,500,000 gold) per annum. Whereas under the revised scheme she will\r\nnot only be entitled to a greater sum, namely 1.08 milliard gold marks\r\n(£54,000,000 gold) per annum; but, inasmuch as she will be accorded a\r\npriority on Germany’s available resources, and as the total charge is\r\nwithin Germany’s capacity, she may reasonably expect to be paid.\r\n\r\nMy proposal provides for the complete restoration of the devastated\r\nprovinces at a fair valuation of the actual damage done, and it\r\nabandons other rival claims which stand in the way of the priority of\r\nthis paramount claim. But apart from this, about which opinions will\r\ndiffer, and apart from the increased likelihood which it affords of\r\nreally getting payment, France will actually receive a larger sum than\r\nif the letter of the existing agreements is adhered to all round.\r\n\r\n_Belgium_ is entitled at present to 8 per cent of the receipts, which\r\nunder the London Settlement would amount to 280 million gold marks per\r\nannum on assumption (_a_) and 368 million on assumption (_b_). Under\r\nthe new proposal she will receive 180 million gold marks per annum\r\nand will gain in certainty what she loses in possible receipts. The\r\nsatisfaction of her existing priority should be adjusted by mutual\r\nagreement between herself and France.\r\n\r\n_Italy_ would gain immensely. She is entitled to 10 per cent of the\r\nreceipts under the London Settlement (together with some claims on\r\nproblematical receipts from Austria and Bulgaria); that is to say, 326\r\nmillion gold marks per annum on assumption (_a_) and 460 million on\r\nassumption (_b_). But these sums are far below the annual charge of her\r\nobligations towards the United Kingdom and the United States, which,\r\nconverted into gold marks on the same basis as that employed above in\r\nthe case of France, amounts to 1000 million gold marks per annum.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  III. _The Assistance of New States_\r\n\r\nI have reserved above, out of the claims of Great Britain, a sum of\r\none milliard gold marks, with the object, not that she should retain\r\nthis sum for herself, but that she should use it to ease the financial\r\nproblems of two states for which she has a certain responsibility,\r\nnamely Austria and Poland.\r\n\r\n_Austria’s_ problems are well known and attract a general sympathy. The\r\nViennese were not made for tragedy; the world feels that, and there\r\nis none so bitter as to wish ill to the city of Mozart. Vienna has\r\nbeen the capital of degenerate greatness, but, released from imperial\r\ntemptations, she is now free to fulfil her true rôle of providing for\r\na quarter–part of Europe the capital of commerce and the arts. Somehow\r\nshe has laughed and cried her way through the last two years; and\r\nnow, I think, though on the surface her plight is more desperate than\r\nbefore, a very little help will be enough. She has no army, and by\r\nvirtue of the depreciation of her money a trifling internal debt. Too\r\nmuch help may make of her a lifelong beggar; but a little will raise\r\nher from despondency and render her financial problem no longer beyond\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\nMy proposal, then, is to cancel the debts she owes to foreign\r\ngovernments, including empty claims to Reparation, and to give her a\r\ncomparatively small sum out of the milliard gold marks reserved from\r\nBritish claims on Germany. Credits placed at her disposal in Berlin,\r\nequivalent in value to 300 million gold marks, to be available, as\r\nrequired, over a period of five years, might be enough.\r\n\r\nFor the other new States, the cancelation of debt owing, and, in the\r\ncase of Hungary, of Reparation claims, should be enough, except for\r\nPoland.\r\n\r\n_Poland_, too, must be given a possible problem, but it is not easy\r\nto be practical with so impracticable a subject. Her main problem can\r\nbe solved only by time, and the recovery of her neighbors. I deal\r\nhere only with the urgent question of making just possible for her a\r\nreorganization of currency, and of facilitating a peaceable intercourse\r\nbetween herself and Germany. For this purpose I would assign to her the\r\nbalance of the reserved milliard, namely, 700 million gold marks, of\r\nwhich the annual interest should be available to her unconditionally,\r\nbut of which the capital should be employed only for a currency\r\nreorganization, under conditions to be approved by the United States\r\nand Great Britain.\r\n\r\nIn its essentials this scheme is very simple. I think that it satisfies\r\nmy criterion of leaving every Finance Minister in Europe with a\r\npossible problem. The rest must come gradually, and I will not burden\r\nthe argument of this book by considering along what lines the detailed\r\nsolutions should be sought.\r\n\r\nWho are the losers? Even on paper—far more in reality—every\r\ncontinental country gains an advantage. But on paper the United States\r\nand the United Kingdom are losers. What is each of them giving up?\r\n\r\nUnder the London Settlement Great Britain is entitled to 22 per cent\r\nof the receipts, which is from 780 to 1010 million gold marks per\r\nannum (£39,000,000 to £50,500,000 gold) according to which assumption\r\nis adopted as to the volume of German exports. She is owed by various\r\nEuropean governments (including Russia, see Appendix No. IX.)\r\n£1,800,000,000, which at 6 per cent for interest and sinking fund is\r\n£108,000,000 per annum. On paper she would forego these sums, say\r\n£150,000,000 per annum, altogether. In actual fact, her prospects of\r\nsecuring more than a fraction of this amount are remote. Great Britain\r\nlives by commerce, and most Englishmen now need but little persuading\r\nthat she will gain more in honor, prestige, and wealth by employing\r\na prudent generosity to preserve the equilibrium of commerce and\r\nthe well–being of Europe, than by attempting to exact a hateful and\r\ncrushing tribute, whether from her victorious Allies or her defeated\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nThe United States would forego on paper a capital sum of about 6500\r\nmillion dollars, which, at 6 per cent, represents an annual charge\r\nof $390,000,000 (£78,000,000 gold). But in my opinion the chance of\r\nher being actually paid any considerable amount of this, if she tries\r\nto exact it, is decidedly remote.[111] Is there any likelihood of\r\nthe United States joining in such a scheme _soon enough_ (for I feel\r\nconfident she will cancel these debts in the end) to be useful?\r\n\r\nMost Americans, with whom I have discussed this question, express\r\nthemselves as personally favorable to the cancelation of the European\r\ndebts, but add that so great a majority of their countrymen think\r\notherwise that such a proposal is at present outside practical\r\npolitics. They think, therefore, that it is premature to discuss it;\r\nfor the present, America must pretend she is going to demand the money\r\nand Europe must pretend she is going to pay it. Indeed, the position is\r\nmuch the same as that of German Reparation in England in the middle\r\nof 1921. Doubtless my informants are right about this public opinion,\r\nthe mysterious entity which is the same thing perhaps as Rousseau’s\r\nGeneral Will. Yet, all the same, I do not attach, to what they tell me,\r\ntoo much importance. Public opinion held that Hans Andersen’s Emperor\r\nwore a fine suit; and in the United States especially, public opinion\r\nchanges sometimes, as it were, _en bloc_.\r\n\r\nIf, indeed, public opinion were an unalterable thing, it would be a\r\nwaste of time to discuss public affairs. And though it may be the\r\nchief business of newsmen and politicians to ascertain its momentary\r\nfeatures, a writer ought to be concerned, rather, with what public\r\nopinion should be. I record these platitudes because many Americans\r\ngive their advice, as though it were actually immoral to make\r\nsuggestions which public opinion does not now approve. In America,\r\nI gather, an act of this kind is considered so reckless, that some\r\nimproper motive is at once suspected, and criticism takes the form of\r\nan inquiry into the culprit’s personal character and antecedents.\r\n\r\nLet us inquire, however, a little more deeply into the sentiments and\r\nemotions which underlie the American attitude to the European debts.\r\nThey want to be generous to Europe, both out of good feeling and\r\nbecause many of them now suspect that any other course would upset\r\ntheir own economic equilibrium. But they don’t want to be “done.” They\r\ndo not want it to be said that once again the old cynics in Europe have\r\nbeen one too many for them. Times, too, have been bad and taxation\r\noppressive; and many parts of America do not feel rich enough at the\r\nmoment to favor a light abandonment of a possible asset. Moreover,\r\nthese arrangements, between nations warring together, they liken much\r\nmore closely than we do to ordinary business transactions between\r\nindividuals. It is, they say, as though a bank having made an unsecured\r\nadvance to a client, in whom they believe, at a difficult time when\r\nhe would have gone under without it, this client were then to cry\r\noff paying. To permit such a thing would be to do an injury to the\r\nelementary principles of business honor.\r\n\r\nThe average American, I fancy, would like to see the European nations\r\napproaching him with a pathetic light in their eyes and the cash in\r\ntheir hands, saying, “America, we owe to you our liberty and our\r\nlife; here we bring what we can in grateful thanks, money not wrung\r\nby grievous taxation from the widow and orphan, but saved, the best\r\nfruits of victory, out of the abolition of armaments, militarism,\r\nEmpire, and internal strife, made possible by the help you freely gave\r\nus.” And then the average American would reply: “I honor you for your\r\nintegrity. It is what I expected. But I did not enter the war for\r\nprofit or to invest my money well. I have had my reward in the words\r\nyou have just uttered. The loans are forgiven. Return to your homes and\r\nuse the resources I release to uplift the poor and the unfortunate.”\r\nAnd it would be an essential part of the little scene that his reply\r\nshould come as a complete and overwhelming surprise.\r\n\r\nAlas for the wickedness of the world! It is not in international\r\naffairs that we can secure the sentimental satisfactions which we all\r\nlove. For only individuals are good, and all nations are dishonorable,\r\ncruel, and designing. In deciding whether Italy (for example) must pay\r\nwhat she owes, America must consider the consequences of trying to make\r\nher pay,—so far as self–interest is concerned, in terms of economic\r\nequilibrium between America and Italy, and, so far as generosity is\r\nconcerned, in terms of Italian peasants and their lives. And whilst the\r\nvarious Prime Ministers will telegraph something suitable, drafted by\r\ntheir private secretaries, to the effect that America’s action makes\r\nthe moment of writing the most important in the history of the world\r\nand proves that Americans are the noblest creatures living, America\r\nmust not expect adequate or appropriate thanks.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, since time presses, we cannot rely on American\r\nassistance, and we must do without it if necessary. If America\r\ndoes not feel ready to participate in a Conference of Revision and\r\nReconstruction, Great Britain should be prepared to do her part in the\r\ncancelation of paper claims, irrespective of similar action by the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThe simplicity of my plan may be emphasized by summarizing it. (1)\r\nGreat Britain, and if possible America too, to cancel all the debts\r\nowing them from the Governments of Europe and to waive their claims to\r\nany share of German Reparation; (2) Germany to pay 1260 million gold\r\nmarks (£63,000,000 gold) per annum for 30 years, and to hold available\r\na lump sum of 1000 million gold marks for assistance to Poland and\r\nAustria; (3) this annual payment to be assigned in the shares 1080\r\nmillion gold marks to France and 180 million to Belgium.\r\n\r\nThis would be a just, sensible, and permanent settlement. If France\r\nwere to refuse it, she would indeed be sacrificing the substance to\r\nthe shadow. In spite of superficial appearances to the contrary, it\r\nis also in the self–interest of Great Britain. Perhaps British public\r\nopinion, profoundly altered though it now is, may not yet be reconciled\r\nto obtaining nothing. But this is a case where a wise nation will do\r\nbest by acting in a large way. I have not neglected to consider with\r\ncare the various possible devices by which Great Britain might get, or\r\nappear to get, something for herself from the settlement. She might\r\ntake, for instance, in satisfaction of her claims some of the C Bonds\r\nunder the London Settlement, which, having a third priority after\r\nprovision for the A and B Bonds, can be given a nominal value but are\r\nreally worth nothing. She might, in lieu of receiving a share of the\r\nproceeds of the German customs, stipulate that her goods should be\r\nadmitted into Germany free of duty. She might seek a partial control\r\nover German industries, or obtain the services of German organization\r\nfor the future exploitation of Russia. Plans of this sort attract an\r\ningenious mind and are not to be discarded too hastily. Yet I prefer\r\nthe simple plan, and I believe that all these devices are contrary to\r\ntrue wisdom.\r\n\r\nThere is a disposition in some quarters to insist that any concessions\r\nto France by Great Britain and the United States, affecting Reparation\r\nand Inter–Ally Debt, should be conditional on France’s acceptance of a\r\nmore pacific policy towards the rest of the world than that to which\r\nshe herself appears to be inclined. I hope that France will abandon her\r\nopposition to proposals for reduced military and naval establishments.\r\nWhat a handicap her youth will suffer if she maintains conscription\r\nwhilst her neighbors, voluntarily or involuntarily, have abandoned\r\nit! Does she realize the impossibility of friendship between Great\r\nBritain and _any_ neighboring Power which embarks on a large program\r\nof submarines? I hope, too, that France will forget her dangerous\r\nambitions in Central Europe and will limit strictly those in the Near\r\nEast; for both are based on rubbishy foundations and will bring her no\r\ngood. That she has anything to fear from Germany in the future which\r\nwe can foresee, except what she may herself provoke, is a delusion.\r\nWhen Germany has recovered her strength and pride, as in due time she\r\nwill, many years must pass before she again casts her eyes Westward.\r\nGermany’s future now lies to the East, and in that direction her hopes\r\nand ambitions, when they revive, will certainly turn.\r\n\r\nFrance has an opportunity now of consolidating her national position\r\ninto one of the stablest, safest, richest on the face of the earth;\r\nself–contained; well– but not over–populated; the heir of a peculiar\r\nand splendid civilization. Neither whining about devastated districts,\r\nwhich are easily repaired, nor boasting of military hegemonies, which\r\ncan quickly ruin her, let her lift up her head as the leader and\r\nmistress of Europe in the peaceful practices of the mind.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, these objects are not to be gained by bargaining and\r\ncannot be imposed from without. Therefore they must not be dragged\r\ninto the Reparation Settlement. This Settlement must be offered France\r\non one condition only,—that she accepts it. But if, like Shylock, she\r\nclaims her pound of flesh, then let the Law prevail. Let her have her\r\nbond, and let us have our bonds too. Let her get what she can from\r\nGermany and pay what she owes to the United States and England.\r\n\r\nThe chief question for dispute is, perhaps, whether an annual payment\r\nby Germany of £63,000,000 (gold) is enough. I admit that the payment\r\nof a somewhat larger sum may prove to be within her capacity. But I\r\nrecommend this figure because on the one hand it is sufficient to\r\nrestore the destruction done in France, yet on the other is not so\r\ncrushing that, to make Germany pay it, we need be in a position to\r\ninvade her every spring and autumn. We must fix the payment at an\r\namount which Germany herself will recognize as not unjust, and which is\r\nsufficiently within her maximum capacity to leave her some incentive to\r\nwork and pay it off.\r\n\r\nSuppose that we knew the theoretical maximum of Germany’s capacity\r\nto produce and sell abroad a surplus of goods, or could hit on some\r\nsliding scale which would automatically absorb year by year whatever\r\nsurplus there was; should we be wise to demand it? The project of\r\nextracting at the point of the bayonet—for that is what it would\r\nmean—a payment so heavy that it would never be paid voluntarily,\r\nand to go on doing this until all the makers of the Peace Treaty of\r\nVersailles have been long dead and buried in their local Valhallas, is\r\nneither good nor sensible.\r\n\r\nMy own proposals, moderate though they may seem in comparison with\r\nothers, throw on Germany a very great burden. They procure for France\r\nan enormous benefit. Frenchmen, having fed to satiety on imaginary\r\nfigures, are nearly ready, I think, to find a surprising flavor and\r\npiquancy in real ones. Let them consider what a tremendous financial\r\nstrength my scheme would give them. Freed from external debt, they\r\nwould receive in real values each year for thirty years a payment\r\nequivalent in gold to nearly half the gold reserve now held by the Bank\r\nof France; and at the end of the set period Germany would have paid\r\nback ten times what she took after 1870.\r\n\r\nIs it for Englishmen to complain? Are they really losers? One cannot\r\ncast up a balance–sheet between incommensurables. But peace and amity\r\nmight be won for Europe. And England is only asked (as I fancy she\r\nknows pretty well, by now, in her bones) to give up something which she\r\nwill never get anyhow. The alternative is that we and the United States\r\nwill be jockeyed out of our claims amidst a general international\r\ndisgust.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[111] This scheme is in no way concerned with the debt of Great Britain\r\nto the United States, which is excluded from the above figures. The\r\nquestion of the right treatment of this debt (which differs from the\r\nothers chiefly because the interest on it is capable of being actually\r\ncollected in cash) raises other issues with which I am not dealing\r\nhere. The above proposals for cancelation relate solely to the debts\r\nowing by the Governments of Continental Europe to the Governments of\r\nGreat Britain and the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         APPENDIX OF DOCUMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                    I. THE SPA AGREEMENT, JULY 1920\r\n\r\n (_A_) _Summary[112] of the Agreement upon Reparations between the\r\n   Allies, signed by the British Empire, France, Italy, Japan, Belgium,\r\n   and Portugal._\r\n\r\nARTICLE 1 provides that in pursuance of the Treaty of Versailles the\r\nsums received from Germany for reparations shall be divided in the\r\nfollowing proportions:\r\n\r\n  France              52 per cent.\r\n  British Empire      22    ”\r\n  Italy               10    ”\r\n  Belgium              8    ”\r\n  Japan and Portugal     ¾ of 1 per cent each.\r\n\r\nThe remaining 6½ per cent is reserved for the Serbo–Croat–Slovene\r\nState and for Greece, Rumania, and other Powers not signatories of the\r\nAgreement.\r\n\r\nARTICLE 2 provides that the aggregate amount received for reparation\r\nfrom Austria–Hungary and Bulgaria, together with amounts that may be\r\nreceived in respect of the liberation of territories belonging to the\r\nformer Austro–Hungarian Monarchy, shall be divided:\r\n\r\n  (_a_) As to half in the proportions mentioned in Article 1.\r\n\r\n  (_b_) As to the other half, Italy shall receive 40 per cent, while 60\r\n    per cent is reserved for Greece, Rumania, and the Serbo–Croat–Slovene\r\n    State and other Powers entitled to reparations but not signatories of\r\n    the Agreement.\r\n\r\nARTICLE 3 provides that the Allied Governments shall adopt measures to\r\nfacilitate if necessary the issue by Germany of loans destined for the\r\ninternal requirements of that country and to the prompt discharge of\r\nthe German debt to the Allies.\r\n\r\nARTICLE 4 deals in detail with the keeping of accounts by the\r\nReparation Commission.\r\n\r\nARTICLE 5 secures to Belgium her priority of £100,000,000 gold and\r\nenumerates the securities affected by such priority.[113]\r\n\r\nARTICLE 6 deals with the valuation of ships surrendered under the\r\nvarious Peace Treaties, and provides for the allocation of sums\r\nreceived for the hire of such ships. It deals also with questions\r\noutstanding as to the decisions taken by the Belgian Prize Courts.\r\nBelgium receives compensation out of the shares of other Allied Powers.\r\n\r\nARTICLE 7 refers to the Allied cruisers, floating docks, and material\r\nhanded over under the Protocol of January 10, 1920, as compensation for\r\nthe German warships which were sunk.\r\n\r\nARTICLE 8 declares that the same Protocol shall apply to the proceeds\r\nof the sale of ships and war material surrendered under the naval\r\nclauses of the Treaty, virtually including the proceeds of naval war\r\nmaterial sold by the Reparation Commission.\r\n\r\nARTICLE 9 gives Italy an absolutely prior claim to certain specified\r\nsums as a set–off to amounts due to her by Austria–Hungary and Bulgaria.\r\n\r\nARTICLE 10 reserves the rights of Poland and declares that this\r\nAgreement shall not apply to her.\r\n\r\nARTICLE 11 maintains the rights of countries who lent money to Belgium\r\nbefore November 11, 1918, and makes provision for repayment immediately\r\nafter satisfaction of the Belgian claim to priority in respect of\r\n£100,000,000.\r\n\r\nARTICLE 12 maintains the rights of the Allied Powers to the repayment\r\nof credits granted to ex–enemy Powers for the purposes of relief.\r\n\r\nARTICLE 13 reserves the question of fixing the cost of the armies of\r\noccupation in Germany on a uniform basis for discussion with the United\r\nStates of America.\r\n\r\n\r\n (_B_) _The Allied Note to Germany on the Subject of Coal Deliveries_\r\n\r\n1. The German Government undertakes to place at the disposal of the\r\nAllies, from August 1, 1920, for the ensuing six months, 2,000,000 tons\r\nof coal per month, this figure having been approved by the Reparation\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\n2. The Allied Governments will credit the Reparation accounts with\r\nthe value of this coal, as far as it is delivered by rail or inland\r\nnavigation, and it will be valued at the German internal price in\r\naccordance with Paragraph 6 (A), Annex V., Part VIII., of the Treaty of\r\nVersailles. In addition, in consideration of the admission of the right\r\nof the Allies to have coal of specified kind and quality delivered to\r\nthem, a premium of five gold marks, payable in cash by the party taking\r\ndelivery, shall be applied to the acquisition of foodstuffs for the\r\nGerman miners.\r\n\r\n3. During the period of the coal deliveries provided for above, the\r\nstipulations of Paragraphs 2, 3, and 4 of the draft Control Protocol of\r\nJuly 11, 1920, shall be put in force at once in the modified form of\r\nthe Annex hereto. (See below.)\r\n\r\n4. An agreement shall be made forthwith between the Allies for\r\ndistribution of the Upper Silesian coal output by a Commission on which\r\nGermany will be represented. This agreement shall be submitted for the\r\napproval of the Reparation Commission.\r\n\r\n5. The Commission, on which the Germans shall be represented, shall\r\nmeet forthwith at Essen. Its purpose shall be to seek means by which\r\nthe conditions of life among the miners with regard to food and\r\nclothing can be improved, with a view to the better working of the\r\nmines.\r\n\r\n6. The Allied Governments declare their readiness to make advances\r\nto Germany equal in amount to the difference between the price paid\r\nunder Paragraph 2 above, and the export price of German coal, f.o.b.\r\nin German ports, or the English export price, f.o.b. in English ports,\r\nwhichever may be the lowest, as laid down in Paragraph VI. (B) of\r\nAnnex V., Part VIII., of the Treaty of Versailles. These advances\r\nshall be made in accordance with Articles 235 and 251 of the Treaty of\r\nVersailles. They shall enjoy an absolute priority over all other Allied\r\nclaims on Germany. The advances shall be made at the end of each month,\r\nin accordance with the number of tons delivered and the average f.o.b.\r\nprice of coal during the period. Advances on account shall be made by\r\nthe Allies at the end of the first month, without waiting for exact\r\nfigures.\r\n\r\n7. If by November 15, 1920, it is ascertained that the total deliveries\r\nfor August, September, and October 1920 have not reached 6,000,000\r\ntons, the Allies will proceed to the occupation of a further portion of\r\nGerman territory, either the region of the Ruhr or some other.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                _Annex_\r\n\r\n1. A permanent delegation of the Reparation Commission will be set up\r\nat Berlin, whose mission will be to satisfy itself by the following\r\nmeans that the deliveries of coal to the Allies provided for under the\r\nAgreement of July 15, 1920, shall be carried out: The programmes for\r\nthe general distribution of output, with details of origin and kind,\r\non the one hand, and the orders given to ensure deliveries to the\r\nAllied Powers on the other hand, shall be drawn up by the responsible\r\nGerman authorities and submitted by them for the approval of the said\r\ndelegation a reasonable time before their despatch to the executive\r\nbodies responsible for their execution.\r\n\r\n2. No modification in the said programme which may involve a reduction\r\nin the amount of the deliveries to the Allies shall be put into effect\r\nwithout prior approval of the Delegation of the Reparation Commission\r\nin Berlin.\r\n\r\n3. The Reparation Commission, to which the German Government must\r\nperiodically report the execution by the competent bodies of the orders\r\nfor deliveries to the Allies, will notify to the interested Powers any\r\ninfraction of the principles adopted herein.\r\n\r\n\r\n            II. THE PARIS DECISIONS,[114] JANUARY 29, 1921\r\n\r\n1. In satisfaction of the obligations laid on her by Articles 231 and\r\n232 of the Treaty of Versailles, Germany shall pay, apart from the\r\nrestitutions which she must effect in conformity with Article 238 and\r\nall obligations under the Treaty:\r\n\r\n(1) Fixed annuities, payable in equal instalments at the end of each\r\nsix months, as follows:\r\n\r\n                                   milliard gold marks\r\n  (_a_) Two        annuities of       2       (May 1, 1921–May 1, 1923)\r\n  (_b_) Three           ”             3       (May 1, 1923–May 1, 1926)\r\n  (_c_) Three           ”             4       (May 1, 1926–May 1, 1929)\r\n  (_d_) Three           ”             5       (May 1, 1929–May 1, 1932)\r\n  (_e_) Thirty–one      ”             6       (May 1, 1932–May 1, 1963)\r\n\r\n(2) Forty–two annuities, reckoning from May 1, 1921, equivalent to 12\r\nper cent of the value of Germany’s exports, levied on the receipts\r\nfrom them and payable in gold two months after the conclusion of each\r\nsix–monthly period.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that (2) above shall be completely carried out, Germany will\r\naccord to the Reparation Commission every facility for verifying the\r\namount of the exports and for establishing the necessary supervision.\r\n\r\n2. The German Government shall deliver forthwith to the Reparation\r\nCommission Bearer Bonds payable at the due dates laid down in Article\r\n1 (1) of the present scheme, and of an amount equal to each of the\r\nsix–monthly instalments payable thereunder. Instructions will be given\r\nwith the object of facilitating, on the part of such Powers as may\r\nrequire it, the mobilisation of the portion accruing to them under the\r\nAgreements which they have established amongst themselves.\r\n\r\n3. Germany shall be entitled at any time to anticipate the fixed\r\nportion of her obligation.\r\n\r\nPayments made by her in anticipation shall be applied in reduction of\r\nthe fixed annuities prescribed in Article 1 (1), discounted at a rate\r\nof 8 per cent up to May 1, 1923, 6 per cent from May 1, 1923, to May 1,\r\n1925, and 5 per cent after May 1, 1925.\r\n\r\n4. Germany shall not embark on any credit operation abroad, directly\r\nor indirectly, without the approval of the Reparation Commission.\r\nThis restriction applies to the Government of the German Empire, the\r\nGovernment of the German States, German provincial and municipal\r\nauthorities, and also to companies and enterprises controlled by these\r\nGovernments and authorities.\r\n\r\n5. In pursuance of Article 248 of the Treaty of Versailles all the\r\nassets and revenues of the German Empire and its constituent States\r\nare held in guarantee of the complete execution by Germany of the\r\nprovisions of this scheme.\r\n\r\nThe receipts of the German Customs, by land and sea, in particular the\r\nreceipts of all import and export duties and all supplementary taxes,\r\nconstitute a special pledge for the execution of the present Agreement.\r\n\r\nNo modification shall be introduced, liable to diminish the yield of\r\nthe Customs, without the Reparation Commission approving the Customs\r\nLegislation and Regulations of Germany.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the receipts of the German Customs shall be credited to\r\nthe account of the German Government, by a Receiver–General of the\r\nGerman Customs, nominated by the German Government with the assent of\r\nthe Reparation Commission.\r\n\r\nIn the event of Germany failing to meet one of the payments laid down\r\nin the present scheme:\r\n\r\n(1) The whole or part of the receipts of the German Customs shall be\r\ntaken over from the Receiver–General of the German Customs by the\r\nReparation Commission and applied by it to the obligations in which\r\nGermany has defaulted. In this event the Reparation Commissions shall,\r\nif it deems necessary, itself assume the administration and collection\r\nof the Customs receipts.\r\n\r\n(2) The Reparation Commission shall be entitled, in addition, to\r\nrequire the German Government to impose such higher tariffs or to\r\ntake such other measures to increase its resources as it may deem\r\nindispensable.\r\n\r\n(3) If this injunction is without effect, the Commission shall be\r\nentitled to declare the German Government in default and to notify this\r\nstate of affairs to the Governments of the Allied and Associated Powers\r\nwho shall take such measures as they think justified.\r\n\r\n                                     (Signed) HENRI JASPAR.\r\n                                              D.

THE FIRST ULTIMATUM OF LONDON, MARCH 3, 1921\r\n\r\nThe following declaration was delivered to Dr. Simons by Mr. Lloyd\r\nGeorge, speaking on behalf of the British and Allied Governments, by\r\nword of mouth:\r\n\r\n“The Allies have been conferring upon the whole position and I am now\r\nauthorised to make this declaration on their behalf:\r\n\r\n“The Treaty of Versailles was signed less than two years ago. The\r\nGerman Government have already defaulted in respect of some of its most\r\nimportant provisions: the delivery for trial of the criminals, who have\r\noffended against the laws of war, disarmament, the payment in cash or\r\nin kind of 20,000,000,000 of gold marks (£1,000,000,000). These are\r\nsome of the provisions. The Allies have displayed no harsh insistence\r\nupon the letter of their bond. They have extended time, they have even\r\nmodified the character of their demands; but each time the German\r\nGovernment failed them.\r\n\r\n“In spite of the Treaty and of the honourable undertaking given at Spa,\r\nthe criminals have not yet been tried, let alone punished, although the\r\nevidence has been in the hands of the German Government for months.\r\nMilitary organisations, some of them open, some clandestine, have been\r\nallowed to spring up all over the country, equipped with arms that\r\nought to have been surrendered. If the German Government had shown in\r\nrespect of reparations a sincere desire to help the Allies to repair\r\nthe terrible losses inflicted upon them by the act of aggression of\r\nwhich the German Imperialist Government was guilty, we should still\r\nhave been ready as before to make all allowances for the legitimate\r\ndifficulties of Germany. But the proposals put forward have reluctantly\r\nconvinced the Allies either that the German Government does not intend\r\nto carry out its Treaty obligations, or that it has not the strength to\r\ninsist, in the face of selfish and short–sighted opposition, upon the\r\nnecessary sacrifices being made.\r\n\r\n“If that is due to the fact that German opinion will not permit it,\r\nthat makes the situation still more serious, and renders it all the\r\nmore necessary that the Allies should bring the leaders of public\r\nopinion once more face to face with facts. The first essential fact for\r\nthem to realise is this—that the Allies, whilst prepared to listen to\r\nevery reasonable plea arising out of Germany’s difficulties, cannot\r\nallow any further paltering with the Treaty.\r\n\r\n                            _The Ultimatum_\r\n\r\n“We have therefore decided—having regard to the infractions already\r\ncommitted, to the determination indicated in these proposals that\r\nGermany means still further to defy and explain away the Treaty, and\r\nto the challenge issued not merely in these proposals but in official\r\nstatements made in Germany by the German Government—that we must\r\nact upon the assumption that the German Government are not merely in\r\ndefault, but deliberately in default; and unless we hear by Monday that\r\nGermany is either prepared to accept the Paris decisions or to submit\r\nproposals which will in other ways be an equally satisfactory discharge\r\nof her obligations under the Treaty of Versailles (subject to the\r\nconcessions made in the Paris proposals), we shall, as from that date,\r\ntake the following course under the Treaty of Versailles.\r\n\r\n“The Allies are agreed:\r\n\r\n  (1) To occupy the towns of Duisburg, Ruhrort, and Düsseldorf, on the\r\n      right bank of the Rhine.\r\n\r\n  (2) To obtain powers from their respective Parliaments requiring their\r\n      nationals to pay a certain proportion of all payments due to Germany\r\n      on German goods to their several Governments, such proportion to be\r\n      retained on account of reparations. (This is in respect of goods\r\n      purchased either in this country or in any other Allied country from\r\n      Germany.)\r\n\r\n  (3) (_a_) The amount of the duties collected by the German Customs\r\n      houses on the external frontiers of the occupied territories to be\r\n      paid to the Reparation Commission.\r\n\r\n      (_b_) These duties to continue to be levied in accordance with the\r\n       German tariff.\r\n\r\n      (_c_) A line of Customs houses to be temporarily established on the\r\n      Rhine and at the boundary of the _têtes des ponts_ occupied by the\r\n      Allied troops; the tariff to be levied on this line, both on the\r\n      entry and export of goods, to be determined by the Allied High\r\n      Commission of the Rhine territory in conformity with the instructions\r\n      of the Allied Governments”.\r\n\r\n\r\n  V. THE GERMAN COUNTER–PROPOSAL, AS TRANSMITTED TO THE UNITED STATES\r\n                      GOVERNMENT, APRIL 24, 1921\r\n\r\nThe United States Government have, by their Note of April 22, opened\r\nthe possibility, in a way which is thankfully acknowledged, of solving\r\nthe reparations problem once more by negotiations ere a solution is\r\neffected by coercive measures. The German Government appreciates this\r\nstep in its full importance. They have in the following proposals\r\nendeavoured to offer that which according to their convictions\r\nrepresents the utmost limit which Germany’s economic resources can\r\nbear, even with the most favourable developments:\r\n\r\n1. Germany expresses her readiness to acknowledge for reparation\r\npurposes a total liability of 50 milliard gold marks (present value).\r\nGermany is also prepared to pay the equivalent of this sum in\r\nannuities, adapted to her economic capacity up to an aggregate of 200\r\nmilliard gold marks. Germany proposes to mobilise her liability in the\r\nfollowing way:\r\n\r\n2. Germany to raise at once an international loan, of which amount,\r\nrate of interest, and amortisation quota are to be agreed on. Germany\r\nwill participate in this loan, and its terms, in order to secure the\r\ngreatest possible success, will contain special concessions, and\r\ngenerally be made as favourable as possible. Proceeds of this loan to\r\nbe placed at the disposal of the Allies.\r\n\r\n3. On the amount of her liability not covered by the international\r\nloan Germany is prepared to pay interest and amortisation quota in\r\naccordance with her economic capacity. In present circumstances she\r\nconsiders the rate of 4 per cent the highest possible.\r\n\r\n4. Germany is prepared to let the Powers concerned have the benefit\r\nof improvements in her economic and financial situation. For this\r\npurpose the amortisation quota should be made variable. In case an\r\nimprovement should take place, the quota would rise, whilst it would\r\ncorrespondingly fall if developments should be in the other direction.\r\nTo regulate such variations an index scheme would have to be prepared.\r\n\r\n5. To accelerate the redemption of the balance, Germany is ready to\r\nassist with all her resources in the reconstruction of the devastated\r\nterritories. She considers reconstruction the most pressing part of\r\nreparation, because it is the most effective way to combat the hatred\r\nand misery caused by the war. She is prepared to undertake, herself,\r\nthe rebuilding of townships, villages, and hamlets, or to assist in\r\nthe reconstruction with labour, material, and her other resources, in\r\nany way the Allies may desire. The cost of such labour and material\r\nshe would pay herself. (Full details about this matter have been\r\ncommunicated to the Reparation Commission.)\r\n\r\n6. Apart from any reconstruction work Germany is prepared to supply\r\nfor the same purpose, to States concerned, any other materials, and\r\nto render them any other services as far as possible on a purely\r\ncommercial basis.\r\n\r\n7. To prove the sincerity of her intention to make reparation at once,\r\nand in an unmistakable way, Germany is prepared to place immediately at\r\nthe disposal of the Reparation Commission the amount of one milliard\r\ngold marks in the following manner: First, 150,000,000 gold marks in\r\ngold, silver, and foreign bills; secondly, 850,000,000 gold marks in\r\nTreasury bills, to be redeemed within a period not exceeding three\r\nmonths by foreign bills and other foreign values.\r\n\r\n8. Germany is further prepared, if the United States and the Allies\r\nshould so desire, to assume part of the indebtedness of the Allies to\r\nthe United States as far as her economic capacity will allow her.\r\n\r\n9. In respect of the method by which the German expenditures for\r\nreparation purposes should be credited against her total liability,\r\nGermany proposes that prices and values should be fixed by a commission\r\nof experts.\r\n\r\n10. Germany is prepared to secure subscribers for the loan in every\r\npossible way by assigning to them public properties or public income\r\nin a way to be arranged for.\r\n\r\n11. By the acceptance of these proposals all other German liabilities\r\non reparation account are cancelled, and German private property abroad\r\nreleased.\r\n\r\n12. Germany considers that her proposals can only be realised if the\r\nsystem of sanctions is done away with at once; if the present basis of\r\nGerman production is not further diminished; and if the German nation\r\nis again admitted to the world’s commerce and freed of all unproductive\r\nexpenditure.\r\n\r\nThese proposals testify to the German firm will to make good damage\r\ncaused by the war up to the limit of her economic capacity. The amounts\r\noffered, as well as mode of payment, depend on this capacity. As far as\r\ndifferences of opinion as to this capacity exist, the German Government\r\nrecommend that they be examined by a commission of recognised experts\r\nacceptable to all the interested Governments. She declares herself\r\nready in advance to accept as binding any decision come to by it.\r\nShould the United States Government consider negotiations could be\r\nfacilitated by giving the proposals another form, the German Government\r\nwould be thankful if their attention were drawn to points in which the\r\nUnited States Government consider an alteration desirable. The German\r\nGovernment would also readily receive any other proposals the United\r\nStates Government might feel inclined to make.\r\n\r\nThe German Government is too firmly convinced that the peace and\r\nwelfare of the world depend on a prompt, just, and fair solution of\r\nthe reparation problem not to do everything in their power to put the\r\nUnited States in a position which enables them to bring the matter to\r\nthe attention of the Allied Governments.—_Berlin, April 24, 1921._\r\n\r\n\r\n VI. THE ASSESSMENT ANNOUNCED BY THE REPARATION COMMISSION, APRIL 30,\r\n                                 1921\r\n\r\nThe Reparation Commission, in discharge of the provisions of Article\r\n233 of the Treaty of Versailles, has reached a unanimous decision to\r\nfix at 132 milliard gold marks the total of the damages for which\r\nreparation is due by Germany under Article 232 (2) and Part VIII.,\r\nAnnex I. of the said Treaty.\r\n\r\nIn fixing this figure the Commission have made the necessary deductions\r\nfrom the total of damages to cover restitutions effected or to be\r\neffected in discharge of Article 238, so that no credit will be due to\r\nGermany from the fact of these restitutions.\r\n\r\nThe Commission have not included in the above figure the sum\r\ncorresponding to the obligation, which falls on Germany as an addition\r\nin virtue of Article 232 (3), “to make reimbursement of all sums which\r\nBelgium has borrowed from the Allied and Associated Governments up to\r\nNovember 11, 1918, together with interest at the rate of 5 per cent per\r\nannum on such sums.”\r\n\r\n\r\n           VII. THE SECOND ULTIMATUM OF LONDON, MAY 5, 1921\r\n\r\nThe Allied Powers, taking note of the fact that, in spite of the\r\nsuccessive concessions made by the Allies since the signature of the\r\nTreaty of Versailles, and in spite of the warnings and sanctions agreed\r\nupon at Spa and at Paris, as well as of the sanctions announced in\r\nLondon and since applied, the German Government is still in default\r\nin the fulfilment of the obligations incumbent upon it under the\r\nterms of the Treaty of Versailles as regards (1) disarmament; (2) the\r\npayment due on May 1, 1921, under Article 235 of the Treaty, which\r\nthe Reparation Commission has already called upon it to make at this\r\ndate; (3) the trial of the war criminals as further provided for by\r\nthe Allied Notes of February 13 and May 7, 1920; and (4) certain other\r\nimportant respects, notably those which arise under Articles 264 to\r\n267, 269, 273, 321, 322, and 327 of the Treaty, decide:—\r\n\r\n  (_a_) To proceed forthwith with such preliminary measures as may be\r\n    required for the occupation of the Ruhr Valley by the Allied Forces on\r\n    the Rhine in the contingency provided for in Paragraph (_d_) of this\r\n    Note.\r\n\r\n  (_b_) In accordance with Article 233 of the Treaty to invite the\r\n    Reparation Commission to prescribe to the German Government without\r\n    delay the time and manner for securing and discharging the entire\r\n    obligation incumbent upon that Government, and to announce their\r\n    decision on this point to the German Government at latest on May 6.\r\n\r\n  (_c_) To call upon the German Government categorically to declare\r\n    within a period of six days from the receipt of the above decision its\r\n    resolve (1) to carry out without reserve or condition their obligations\r\n    as defined by the Reparation Commission; (2) to accept without reserve\r\n    or condition the guarantees in respect of those obligations prescribed\r\n    by the Reparation Commission; (3) to carry out without reserve or delay\r\n    the measures of military, naval, and aerial disarmament notified to the\r\n    German Government by the Allied Powers in their Note of January 29,\r\n    1921, those overdue being completed at once, and the remainder by the\r\n    prescribed dates; (4) to carry out without reserve or delay the trial\r\n    of the war criminals and the other unfulfilled portions of the Treaty\r\n    referred to in the first paragraph of this Note.\r\n\r\n  (_d_) Failing fulfilment by the German Government of the above\r\n    conditions by May 12, to proceed to the occupation of the Valley of\r\n    the Ruhr and to take all other military and naval measures that may be\r\n    required. Such occupation will continue so long as Germany fails to\r\n    comply with the conditions summarised in Paragraph (_c_).\r\n\r\n                           (Signed) HENRI JASPAR.\r\n                                    A.

Germany will perform in the manner laid down in this Schedule her\r\nobligations to pay the total fixed in accordance with Articles 231,\r\n232, and 233 of the Treaty of Versailles by the Commission—viz.\r\n132 milliards of gold marks (£6,600,000,000) less (_a_) the amount\r\nalready paid on account of Reparation; (_b_) sums which may from time\r\nto time be credited to Germany in respect of State properties in\r\nceded territory, etc.; and (_c_) any sums received from other enemy\r\nor ex–enemy Powers in respect of which the Commission may decide that\r\ncredits should be given to Germany, _plus_ the amount of the Belgian\r\ndebt to the Allies, the amounts of these deductions and additions to be\r\ndetermined later by the Commission.\r\n\r\n2. Germany shall create and deliver to the Commission in substitution\r\nfor bonds already delivered or deliverable under Paragraph 12 (_c_)\r\nof Annex 2 of Part VIII. (Reparation) of the Treaty of Versailles the\r\nbonds hereinafter described.\r\n\r\n(_A_) Bonds for an amount of 12 milliard gold marks (£600,000,000).\r\nThese bonds shall be created and delivered at latest on July 1, 1921.\r\nThere shall be an annual payment from funds to be provided by Germany\r\nas prescribed in this agreement, in each year from May 1, 1921, equal\r\nin amount to 6 per cent of the nominal value of the issued bonds, out\r\nof which there shall be paid interest at 5 per cent per annum, payable\r\nhalf–yearly on the bonds outstanding at any time, and the balance to\r\nsinking fund for the redemption of the bonds by annual drawings at par.\r\nThese bonds are hereinafter referred to as bonds of Series (_A_).\r\n\r\n(_B_) Bonds for a further amount of 38 milliard gold marks\r\n(£1,900,000,000). These bonds shall be created and delivered at the\r\nlatest on November 1, 1921. There shall be an annual payment from funds\r\nto be provided by Germany as prescribed in this agreement in each year\r\nfrom November 1, 1921, equal in amount to 6 per cent of the nominal\r\nvalue of the issued bonds, out of which there shall be paid interest\r\nat 5 per cent per annum, payable half–yearly on the bonds outstanding\r\nat any time and the balance to sinking fund for the redemption of the\r\nbonds by annual drawings at par. These bonds are hereinafter referred\r\nto as bonds of Series (_B_).\r\n\r\n(_C_) Bonds for 82 milliards of gold marks (£4,100,000,000), subject\r\nto such subsequent adjustment by creation or cancellation of bonds as\r\nmay be required under Paragraph (1). These bonds shall be created and\r\ndelivered to the Reparation Commission, without coupons attached, at\r\nlatest on November 1, 1921; they shall be issued by the Commission as\r\nand when it is satisfied that the payments which Germany undertakes to\r\nmake in pursuance of this agreement are sufficient to provide for the\r\npayment of interest and sinking fund on such bonds. There shall be an\r\nannual payment from funds to be provided by Germany as prescribed in\r\nthis agreement in each year from the date of issue by the Reparation\r\nCommission equal in amount to 6 per cent of the nominal value of the\r\nissued bonds, out of which shall be paid interest at 5 per cent per\r\nannum, payable half–yearly on the bonds outstanding at any time, and\r\nthe balance to sinking fund for the redemption of the bonds by annual\r\ndrawings at par. The German Government shall supply to the Commission\r\ncoupons for such bonds as and when issued by the Commission. These\r\nbonds are hereinafter referred to as bonds of Series (_C_).\r\n\r\n3. The bonds provided for in Article 2 shall be signed German\r\nGovernment bearer bonds, in such form and in such denominations as the\r\nReparation Commission shall prescribe for the purpose of making them\r\nmarketable, and shall be free of all German taxes and charges of every\r\ndescription present or future.\r\n\r\nSubject to the provisions of Articles 248 and 251 of the Treaty of\r\nVersailles these bonds shall be secured on the whole of the assets and\r\nrevenues of the German Empire and the German States, and in particular\r\non the specific assets and revenues specified in Article 7 of the\r\nagreement. The service of the bonds of Series (_A_), (_B_), and (_C_)\r\nshall be a first, second, and third charge respectively on the said\r\nassets and revenues and shall be met by the payments to be made by\r\nGermany under this Schedule.\r\n\r\n4. Germany shall pay in each year until the redemption of the bonds\r\nprovided for in Article 2 by means of the sinking funds attached\r\nthereto—\r\n\r\n  (1) A sum of two milliard gold marks (£100,000,000).\r\n\r\n  (2) (_a_) A sum equivalent to 25 per cent of the value of her exports\r\n      in each period of 12 months starting from May 1, 1921, as determined\r\n      by the Commission; or\r\n\r\n      (_b_) Alternatively an equivalent amount as fixed in accordance with\r\n      any other index proposed by Germany and accepted by the Commission.\r\n\r\n  (3) A further sum equivalent to 1 per cent of the value of her exports\r\n      as above defined, or alternatively an equivalent amount fixed as\r\n      provided in (_b_) above.\r\n\r\nProvided always that when Germany shall have discharged all her\r\nobligations under this Schedule, other than her liability in respect\r\nof outstanding bonds, the amount to be paid in each year under this\r\nparagraph shall be reduced to the amount required in that year to meet\r\nthe interest and sinking fund on the bonds then outstanding.\r\n\r\nSubject to the provisions of Article 5, the payments to be made in\r\nrespect of Paragraph (1) above shall be made quarterly before the end\r\nof each quarter, _i.e._ before January 15, April 15, July 15, and\r\nOctober 15 each year, and the payments in respect of Paragraphs (2)\r\nand (3) above shall be made quarterly, November 15, February 15, May\r\n15, August 15, and calculated on the basis of the exports in the last\r\nquarter but one preceding that quarter, the first payment to be made\r\nNovember 15, 1921.\r\n\r\n5. Germany will pay within 25 days from this notification one milliard\r\ngold marks (£50,000,000) in gold or approved foreign bills or in drafts\r\nat three months on the German Treasury, endorsed by approved German\r\nbanks and payable in London, Paris, New York, or any other place\r\ndesignated by the Reparation Commission. These payments will be treated\r\nas the first two quarterly instalments of the payments provided for in\r\ncompliance with Article 4 (1).\r\n\r\n6. The Commission will within 25 days from this notification, in\r\naccordance with Paragraph 12 (_d_), Annex II. of the Treaty as amended,\r\nestablish the special Sub–Commission, to be called the Committee of\r\nGuarantees. The Committee of Guarantees will consist of representatives\r\nof the Allied Powers now represented on the Reparation Commission,\r\nincluding a representative of the United States of America, in the\r\nevent of that Government desiring to make the appointment.\r\n\r\nThe Committee shall co–opt not more than three representatives of\r\nnationals of other Powers whenever it shall appear to the Commission\r\nthat a sufficient portion of the bonds to be issued under this\r\nagreement is held by nationals of such Powers to justify their\r\nrepresentation on the Committee of Guarantees.\r\n\r\n7. The Committee of Guarantees is charged with the duty of securing\r\nthe application of Articles 241 and 248 of the Treaty of Versailles.\r\n\r\nIt shall supervise the application to the service of the bonds provided\r\nfor in Article 2 of the funds assigned as security for the payments to\r\nbe made by Germany under Paragraph 4. The funds to be so assigned shall\r\nbe—\r\n\r\n  (_a_) The proceeds of all German maritime and land customs and duties,\r\n    and in particular the proceeds of all import and export duties.\r\n\r\n  (_b_) The proceeds of the levy of 25 per cent on the value of all\r\n    exports from Germany, except those exports upon which a levy of not\r\n    less than 25 per cent is applied under the legislation referred to in\r\n    Article 9.\r\n\r\n  (_c_) The proceeds of such direct or indirect taxes or any other\r\n    funds as may be proposed by the German Government and accepted by the\r\n    Committee of Guarantees in addition to or in substitution for the funds\r\n    specified in (_a_) or (_b_) above.\r\n\r\nThe assigned funds shall be paid to accounts to be opened in the name\r\nof the Committee and supervised by it, in gold or in foreign currency\r\napproved by the Committee. The equivalent of the 25 per cent levy\r\nreferred to in Paragraph (_b_) shall be paid in German currency by the\r\nGerman Government to the exporter.\r\n\r\nThe German Government shall notify to the Committee of Guarantees any\r\nproposed action which may tend to diminish the proceeds of any of the\r\nassigned funds, and shall, if the Committee demand it, substitute some\r\nother approved funds.\r\n\r\nThe Committee of Guarantees shall be charged further with the duty\r\nof conducting on behalf of the Commission the examination provided\r\nfor in Paragraph 12 (_b_) of Annex 2 to Part VIII. of the Treaty of\r\nVersailles, and of verifying on behalf of the said Commission, and if\r\nnecessary of correcting, the amount declared by the German Government\r\nas the value of German exports for the purpose of the calculation of\r\nthe sum payable in each year under Article 4 (2) and the amounts of\r\nthe funds assigned under this Article to the service of the bonds.\r\nThe Committee shall be entitled to take such measures as it may deem\r\nnecessary for the proper discharge of its duties.\r\n\r\nThe Committee of Guarantees is not authorised to interfere in German\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\n8. Germany shall on demand, subject to the prior approval of the\r\nCommission, provide such material and labour as any of the Allied\r\nPowers may require towards the restoration of the devastated areas\r\nof that Power, or to enable any Allied Power to proceed with the\r\nrestoration or development of its industrial or economic life. The\r\nvalue of such material and labour shall be determined by a valuer\r\nappointed by Germany and a valuer appointed by the Power concerned,\r\nand, in default of agreement, by a referee nominated by the Commission.\r\nThis provision as to valuation does not apply to deliveries under\r\nAnnexes III., IV., V., and VI. to Part VIII. of the Treaty.\r\n\r\n9. Germany shall take every necessary measure of legislative and\r\nadministrative action to facilitate the operation of the German\r\nReparation (Recovery) Act, 1921, in force in the United Kingdom, and\r\nof any similar legislation enacted by any Allied Power, so long as\r\nsuch legislation remains in force. Payments effected by the operation\r\nof such legislation shall be credited to Germany on account of the\r\npayment to be made by her under Article 4 (2). The equivalent in German\r\ncurrency shall be paid by the German Government to the exporter.\r\n\r\n10. Payment for all services rendered, all deliveries in kind, and all\r\nreceipts under Article 9 shall be made to the Reparation Commission by\r\nthe Allied Power receiving the same in cash or current coupons within\r\none month of the receipt thereof, and shall be credited to Germany on\r\naccount of the payments to be made by her under Article 4.\r\n\r\n11. The sum payable under Article 4 (3) and the surplus receipts by the\r\nCommission under Article 4 (1) and (2) in each year, not required for\r\nthe payment of interest and sinking fund on bonds outstanding in that\r\nyear, shall be accumulated and applied so far as they will extend, at\r\nsuch times as the Commission may think fit, by the Commission in paying\r\nsimple interest not exceeding 2½ per cent per annum from May 1,\r\n1921, to May 1, 1926, and thereafter at a rate not exceeding 5 per cent\r\non the balance of the debt not covered by the bonds then issued. No\r\ninterest thereon shall be payable otherwise.\r\n\r\n12. The present Schedule does not modify the provisions securing the\r\nexecution of the Treaty of Versailles, which are applicable to the\r\nstipulations of the present Schedule.\r\n\r\n\r\n            VIII. THE WIESBADEN AGREEMENT, OCTOBER 6, 1921\r\n\r\nThis Agreement, signed by M. Loucheur and Herr Rathenau at Wiesbaden\r\non October 6, 1921, is a lengthy document, consisting of a Protocol,\r\nMemorandum, and Annex. The effective clauses are to be found mainly\r\nin the Annex. The full text has been published in a British White\r\nPaper [Cmd. 1547]. This White Paper also contains (1) an explanatory\r\nMemorandum, (2) the Decision of the Reparation Commission, and (3) a\r\nReport from Sir John Bradbury to the British Treasury. Extracts from\r\nthese three documents are given below.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      1. _Explanatory Memorandum_\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the arrangements proposed by the Wiesbaden\r\nAgreement, it is necessary to bear in mind certain provisions of the\r\nTreaty of Versailles, the application of which is affected by it.\r\n\r\nThe Treaty itself provides in the Reparation Chapter, Part VIII.,\r\nand in some of its Annexes, for the partial liquidation of Germany’s\r\nreparation indebtedness by deliveries in kind. The important passages\r\nin this connection are Paragraph 19 of Annex II. and Annex IV.,\r\nwhich together make extensive provision for the delivery, through\r\nthe Reparation Commission, to the Allied and Associated Powers of\r\nmachinery, equipment, tools, reconstruction material, and, in general,\r\nall such material and labour as is necessary to enable any Allied Power\r\nto proceed with the restoration or development of its industrial or\r\neconomic life.\r\n\r\nGermany’s obligation being stated in terms of gold and not in terms\r\nof commodities, provision has necessarily been made in all cases\r\nfor crediting Germany, from time to time, with the fair value, as\r\nassessed by the Reparation Commission, of such deliveries. Moreover,\r\nsince the proportions received by the respective Powers in kind need\r\nnot necessarily correspond exactly with their respective shares\r\nin Germany’s reparation payments, as determined by Inter–Allied\r\nagreement, provision is further necessarily made in the Treaty\r\nto render each Power accountable not only to Germany, but to the\r\nReparation Commission, for the value of these deliveries. Thus, on\r\nthe one hand, the Treaty stipulates as between the Allies and Germany\r\nthat the value of services under the Annexes shall be credited towards\r\nthe liquidation of Germany’s general obligation, and the Schedule\r\nof Payments assigns the value of Annex deliveries to the service of\r\nthe bonds handed over by Germany as security for her debt. On the\r\nother hand, the Treaty provides that for the purpose of equitable\r\ndistribution as between the Allies, the value of Annex deliveries\r\nshall be reckoned in the same manner as cash payments effected in the\r\nyear, and the Schedule of Payments stipulates that the value of the\r\ndeliveries received by each Power shall, within one month of the date\r\nof delivery, be paid over to the Reparation Commission, either in cash\r\nor in current coupons.\r\n\r\nFurther, the Treaty imposes upon the Reparation Commission not only the\r\nduty of fixing prices, but also of determining the capacity of Germany\r\nto deliver goods demanded by any of the Allies, and, by implication,\r\nof deciding between the competing demands which are made upon that\r\ncapacity by the Allies themselves.\r\n\r\nThe Wiesbaden Agreement provides for the delivery by a German\r\ncompany[116] to French “sinistrés” of “all plant and materials\r\ncompatible with the productive capacity of Germany, her supply of\r\nraw materials and her domestic requirements,” that is to say, of the\r\narticles and materials which can be demanded under Annex IV. and\r\nParagraph 19 of Annex II., which are, by the terms of the Agreement,\r\nin so far as France is concerned, virtually suspended, the obligations\r\nof Germany to deliver to France under the other Annexes remaining\r\nunaffected.\r\n\r\nAny question as to the capacity of Germany to satisfy the requirement\r\nof France, and all questions of price, are to be settled by a\r\nCommission of three members, one French and one German, and a third\r\nselected by common agreement or nominated by the Swiss President.\r\n\r\nThe aggregate value of the deliveries to be made under the Agreement,\r\nand of the deliveries to be made under Annexes III., V. and VI.\r\n(hereafter, for the sake of brevity, called the “Annex deliveries”) in\r\nthe period expiring on the 1st May 1926, is fixed at a maximum of 7\r\nmilliard gold marks.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the Annex deliveries the Agreement in no way modifies\r\nthe Treaty provisions under which Germany is credited and France\r\ndebited forthwith with the value, but special provisions, which are\r\nfinancially the essential part of the Agreement, are made for bringing\r\nto reparation account the value of the Agreement deliveries. These\r\nspecial provisions are designed to secure that Germany shall only be\r\ncredited on reparation account at the time of delivery with a certain\r\nproportion of them, and that deliveries not thus accounted for, which\r\nmay be called “excess deliveries,” shall be liquidated over a period\r\nof years beginning at the earliest on 1st May 1926. The provisions\r\nthemselves are somewhat intricate, comprising, as they do, a series of\r\ninteracting limitations, and they require some elucidation.\r\n\r\n  (1) In no case is credit to be given to Germany in any one year for\r\n    Annex and Agreement deliveries together to an amount exceeding one\r\n    milliard gold marks.\r\n\r\n  (2) In no case is credit to be given to Germany in any one year for\r\n    more than 45 per cent of the value of the Agreement deliveries or for\r\n    more than 35 per cent if the value of the Agreement deliveries exceeds\r\n    one milliard gold marks.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the above is to prescribe that 55 per cent (or, if the\r\nAgreement operates successfully, 65 per cent) of the value of the\r\nAgreement deliveries _as a minimum_ will be the object of deferred\r\npayment by instalments. If the Agreement deliveries reached really high\r\nfigures, the operation of the milliard limitation would make the carry\r\nforward much more than 65 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe excess deliveries are to be liquidated with interest at 5 per cent\r\nper annum in 10 equal annual instalments as from 1st May 1926, subject\r\nto certain conditions:—\r\n\r\n  (1) France shall in no case be debited in one year for Agreement\r\n    deliveries with an amount which, when added to the value of her Annex\r\n    deliveries in that year, would make her responsible for more than her\r\n    share (52 per cent) of the total reparation payments made by Germany in\r\n    that year.\r\n\r\n  (2) Agreement deliveries continue after 1st May 1926, with the same\r\n    provisions for deferred payment. If in any year between May 1926 and\r\n    May 1936 the amount (not exceeding 35 or 45 per cent) of the value of\r\n    that year’s Agreement deliveries to be credited to Germany, together\r\n    with the annual instalment to repay the debt incurred in respect of the\r\n    period ending 1st May 1926, exceeds one milliard, the excess is to be\r\n    carried forward from year to year until a year is reached in which no\r\n    such excess is created by the payment. But in no case shall the amount\r\n    credited, even if it is less than one milliard gold marks, exceed the\r\n    limit laid down by the preceding condition.\r\n\r\n  (3) Any balance with which Germany has not been credited on 1st May\r\n    1936 is to be credited to her with compound interest at 5 per cent in\r\n    four half–yearly payments on 30th June and 31st December 1936 and 30th\r\n    June and 31st December 1937. But, again, these half–yearly payments\r\n    shall not be made if the effect of making them would be to exceed the\r\n    limit laid down in Condition 1 above.\r\n\r\n  (4) Agreement deliveries continue indefinitely after 1st May 1936, with\r\n    power, however, to Germany to arrest them whenever the execution of\r\n    them would result in France owing more than 52 per cent of Germany’s\r\n    annual reparation payment in respect of Annex deliveries, deferred\r\n    payments already matured, and the 35 or 45 per cent of current\r\n    deliveries.\r\n\r\nFrom the above it is to be noted that, while there is a limitation for\r\nthe first five years of the amount of Agreement deliveries which can be\r\ndemanded, there is—\r\n\r\n  (1) No point at which the right of France to demand these special\r\n    deliveries automatically terminates.\r\n\r\n  (2) No final limitation upon the value of the deliveries which can be\r\n    demanded by France during the lifetime of the Agreement.\r\n\r\n  (3) No definitely prescribed period within which France’s debt to\r\n    Germany and to the other partners in reparation shall be liquidated.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt remains necessary to draw attention to one subsidiary point of a\r\nfinancial character under the Schedule of Payments. Part of Germany’s\r\nannual reparation liability consists of the payment of 26 per cent of\r\nthe value of German exports in each period of twelve months, and part\r\nof the security for the payment consists of the proceeds of a levy of\r\n25 per cent on the value of all German exports. The French Government\r\nhas undertaken to support a request, to be submitted by the German\r\nGovernment to the Reparation Commission, for the inclusion in the\r\nexports which form the basis of these calculations of that part only of\r\nthe value of the deliveries made under the Agreement which is credited\r\nto Germany and debited to France during any particular year.\r\n\r\nIf it can be assumed that any part of the special deliveries to be made\r\nunder the Agreement would, in the absence of the Agreement, have been\r\ndiverted to Germany’s ordinary external trade, then the concession\r\ndesired will have the effect of diminishing the annual payments made by\r\nGermany for the benefit of the Allies as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n  2. _Decision of the Reparation Commission on October 20, 1921, after\r\n    considering the Franco–German Agreement of October 6, 1921_\r\n\r\nThe French Government, having submitted to the Reparation Commission\r\nin accordance with Paragraph 3 of the Memorandum thereto attached\r\nthe Agreement between the representatives of the French and German\r\nGovernments signed at Wiesbaden on the 6th instant, the Commission has\r\ncome to the following decision:—\r\n\r\n  (1) It entirely approves the general principles underlying the\r\n    Agreement whereby special arrangements are proposed for enabling\r\n    Germany to liquidate the largest possible proportion of her reparation\r\n    obligations in the form of goods and services, more especially with a\r\n    view to the speedier restoration of the Devastated Regions.\r\n\r\n  (2) At the same time, it considers that the Agreement involves\r\n    certain departures from the provisions of Part VIII. of the Treaty of\r\n    Versailles, notably Article 237, Paragraphs 12 and 19 of Annex II. and\r\n    Paragraph 5 of Annex IV.\r\n\r\n  (3) As the Commission has no power to authorise such departures, it\r\n    decides to refer the question to the Governments represented on the\r\n    Commission, with a copy of the Memorandum and its Annex, recommending a\r\n    favourable examination of them.\r\n\r\n  (4) The Commission recommends that reasonable facilities for deferred\r\n    payment in respect of the exceptional volume which, if the arrangements\r\n    are successful, the deliveries in kind to France are likely to assume\r\n    during the next few years, should be accorded to France, subject to\r\n    any safeguards which the Allied Governments may regard as necessary to\r\n    protect their respective interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n  3. _Concluding Recommendations of Sir John Bradbury’s Report to the\r\n    British Government (October 26, 1921)_\r\n\r\nThe safeguards which are envisaged as necessary by my Italian and\r\nBelgian colleagues on the Reparation Commission and myself, and for\r\nwhich we presume that our respective Governments will desire to\r\nstipulate are—\r\n\r\n  (1) That a limit of time should be laid down after the expiration of\r\n    which no new deferment of debit should be permitted and the liquidation\r\n    of the existing deferred debits should commence to be made by regular\r\n    annual instalments.\r\n\r\nThe precise length of this period should be determined upon an estimate\r\nof the time necessary to carry out the main work of reconstruction,\r\nregard being had to the time required by Germany to effect the\r\nnecessary supplies. In view of the delays which are inevitable in\r\nregard to operations of the magnitude of those contemplated, the\r\nprescribed period might be reasonably somewhat longer than the four and\r\na half years’ initial period under the agreement, but it should not\r\nexceed seven years.\r\n\r\n  (2) That in no circumstances should the aggregate amount for which\r\n    debit against France for the time being stands deferred be allowed to\r\n    exceed a prescribed amount, say, 4 milliard gold marks.\r\n\r\n  (3) That a provision should be inserted for the payment by France to\r\n    the general reparation account from time to time (within the limits\r\n    of the deferred debits for the time being outstanding) of any amounts\r\n    which may be necessary to secure that the other Allies shall receive\r\n    their proper proportions of the amounts due from Germany under the\r\n    Schedule of Payments.\r\n\r\nSubject to the introduction of these safeguards, to which it would\r\nnot appear that legitimate exception could be taken, the arrangements\r\ncontemplated by the agreement may be expected to accelerate the\r\nsolution of the Reparation problem on practical lines in a manner\r\nadvantageous to France without prejudicing the interests of other\r\nPowers, and it is upon this ground that the Reparation Commission has\r\nunanimously recommended them for favourable examination by the Allied\r\nGovernments.\r\n\r\nIf the Allied Governments approve the general scheme, subject to\r\nwhatever safeguards they may decide to be necessary, there will\r\nremain certain subsidiary points for the Reparation Commission to\r\nconsider—amongst other:—\r\n\r\n  (1) The proposed omission of the excess deliveries from the index\r\n    figure determining the annual liability under the Schedule of Payments,\r\n    until such time as these deliveries are finally brought to account for\r\n    reparation purposes.\r\n\r\n  (2) The special arrangements for substitution in respect of articles\r\n    of which France is entitled to restitution by identity, involving in\r\n    certain cases money payments; and\r\n\r\n  (3) The special arrangements in regard to the delivery of coal and the\r\n    prices to be credited and debited, which in several particulars affect\r\n    the interest of other Powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n             IX.

The\r\ncomplete text of the Agreement has not been published.\r\n\r\n[113] Of which the most tangible were 400,000,000 Danish kroner payable\r\nin respect of Sleswig, certain sums were from Luxemburg for coal,\r\nany balance available in respect of German ships seized as prizes in\r\nBrazilian ports, and any balance available towards reparation out of\r\nGerman assets in the United States.\r\n\r\n[114] So far as I am aware, no complete official text of these\r\ndecisions has been published in English. The above is translated from\r\nthe French text.\r\n\r\n[115] The Commission published at the same time a warning that it had\r\nnot adopted these claims, but was about to examine them.\r\n\r\n[116] The arrangement under which a German private company is to be\r\ncreated to deal directly with the orders without the intervention of\r\nthe French and German Governments is intended to obviate the delays\r\nwhich experience has shown to be inseparable from the employment of the\r\npresent machinery. It does not appear to have any important bearing on\r\nthe general financial situation, since the deliveries will clearly have\r\nto be financed by the German Government and will ultimately be paid for\r\nby means of a reparation credit in account with the German Government.\r\n\r\n[117] This is a net figure and allows for repayments made up to\r\nJuly 1921, of which the chief items are $78,000,000 by France, and\r\n$111,000,000 by Great Britain.\r\n\r\n[118] The totals at the foot of these two columns include miscellaneous\r\nitems for interest not entered in the particulars given in the columns\r\nthemselves. A further sum of about $250,000,000 will have accrued for\r\ninterest by February 1922.\r\n\r\n[119] These accounts include interest, except in the case of Belgium\r\nand Serbia, from whom interest has not been charged, and in the case of\r\nRussia, where no interest has been entered up since January 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 INDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Allied debts, 170 f., 183, 193 f., 238\r\n\r\n  Armistice negotiations, 145, 148 f.\r\n\r\n  Army of  Occupation,  expenses of, 84_n._, 133 f., 140, 191\r\n\r\n  Austria, 130, 190, 191\r\n\r\n\r\n  Balfour, A.

It\r\nis too much to hope that the arbiters of our destinies will read it and\r\nperhaps learn wisdom, but it should do much good in informing a wide\r\nsection of that public which will in its turn become the arbiters of\r\ntheirs.”\r\n\r\n_SUNDAY CHRONICLE_, Dec. 21, 1919.—“No criticism of the Peace which\r\nomits, as Mr. Keynes seems to me by implication to omit, the aspect of\r\nit not as a treaty, but as a sentence, has any right to be heard by the\r\nEuropean Allied peoples.”\r\n\r\n_THE SPECTATOR_, Dec. 20, 1919.—“The world is not governed by\r\neconomical forces alone, and we do not blame the statesmen at Paris for\r\ndeclining to be guided by Mr. Keynes if he gave them such political\r\nadvice as he sets forth in his book.”\r\n\r\n_THE TIMES_, Jan. 5, 1920.—“Mr. Keynes has written an extremely\r\n‘clever’ book on the Peace Conference and its economic consequences....\r\nAs a whole, his cry against the Peace seems to us the cry of an\r\nacademic mind, accustomed to deal with the abstractions of that\r\nlargely metaphysical exercise known as ‘political economy,’ in revolt\r\nagainst the facts and forces of actual political existence....\r\nIndeed, one of the most striking features of Mr. Keynes’s book is the\r\npolitical inexperience, not to say ingenuousness, which it reveals....\r\nHe believes it would have been wise and just to demand from Germany\r\npayment of £2,000,000,000 ‘in final settlement of all claims without\r\nfurther examination of particulars.’”\r\n\r\n_THE ATHENÆUM_, Jan. 23, 1920.—“This book is a perfectly well–equipped\r\narsenal of facts and arguments, to which every one will resort for\r\nyears to come who wishes to strike a blow against the forces of\r\nprejudice, delusion, and stupidity. It is not easy to make large\r\nnumbers of men reasonable by a book, yet there are no limits to which,\r\nwithout undue extravagance, we may not hope that the influence of\r\nthis book may not extend. Never was the case for reasonableness more\r\npowerfully put. It is enforced with extraordinary art. What might\r\neasily have been a difficult treatise, semi–official or academic,\r\nproves to be as fascinating as a good novel.”\r\n\r\n_FORTNIGHTLY REVIEW_, March 1, 1920.—“Mr. Keynes’s book has now been\r\npublished three months, and no sort of official reply to it has been\r\nissued. Nothing but the angry cries of bureaucrats have been heard. No\r\nsuch crushing indictment of a great act of international policy, no\r\nsuch revelation of the futility of diplomats has even been made.”\r\n\r\n_TIMES LITERARY SUPPLEMENT_, April 29, 1920.—“Mr. Keynes ... has\r\nviolently attacked the whole work of those who made the Treaty in a\r\nbook which exhibits every kind of ability except the political kind....\r\nMr. Keynes knows everything except the elements of politics, which\r\nis the science of discovering, and the art of accomplishing, the\r\npracticable in public affairs.”\r\n\r\n_TIMES_ (“Annual Financial and Commercial Review”), Jan. 28,\r\n1921.—“The almost unhealthy greed with which Mr. Keynes’s book on _The\r\nEconomic Consequences of the Peace_ was devoured in a dozen countries\r\nwas but a symptom of the new desire to appreciate, and, if possible, to\r\ncope with, the economic consequences not only of the peace but of the\r\nwar.”\r\n\r\n_LIVERPOOL COURIER_, Feb. 2, 1921.—“In the eyes of the world—at\r\nleast, of the world that is not pro–German—the reparation costs are\r\nwholly inadequate. It is true that in the eyes of Mr. J. M. Keynes\r\nit is wicked to charge Germany with the cost of war pensions, but we\r\nimagine that the average man with a simple sense of simple justice does\r\nnot agree with Mr. Keynes.”\r\n\r\n“REALIST” in the _ENGLISH REVIEW_, March 1921.—“The operation of\r\nindemnity–payment must be followed through to its remorseless end....\r\nThe cry ‘Germany must pay’ has still a good healthy sound about it.”\r\n\r\n_ENGLISH REVIEW_, June 1921.—“What Mr. Maynard Keynes predicted in his\r\nremarkable book is coming only too true. All over Europe the nations\r\nare standing to arms, thinking boundaries, while trade languishes,\r\nproduction stagnates, and credit lapses into the relativities.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_American_\r\n\r\nJOSEPH P. COTTON in the _EVENING POST_, New York, Jan. 30, 1920.—“Mr.\r\nKeynes’s book is the first good book on peace and the reconstruction\r\nof Europe. The writing is simple and sincere and true ... a great book\r\nwith a real message.”\r\n\r\nPAUL D. CRAVATH in the _SUN AND NEW YORK HERALD_, Feb. 2, 1920.—“No\r\nEnglish novel during or since the war has had such a success as this\r\nbook. It should be read by every thoughtful American. It is the first\r\nserious discussion of the Peace Treaty by a man who knows the facts and\r\nis capable of discussing them with intelligence and authority.”\r\n\r\nHAROLD J. LASKI in the _NATION_, New York, Feb. 7, 1920.—“This is\r\na very great book. If any answer can be made to the overwhelming\r\nindictment of the Treaty that it contains, that answer has yet to\r\nbe published. Mr. Keynes writes with a fullness of knowledge, an\r\nincisiveness of judgment, and a penetration into the ultimate causes\r\nof economic events that perhaps only half–a–dozen living economists\r\nmight hope to rival. Nor is the manner of his book less remarkable than\r\nits substance. The style is like finely–hammered steel. It is full of\r\nunforgettable phrases and of vivid portraits etched in the biting acid\r\nof a passionate moral indignation.”\r\n\r\nF. W. TAUSSIG, Harvard University, in the _QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF\r\nECONOMICS_, Feb. 1920.—“Mr. Keynes needs no introduction to\r\neconomists. The high quality of his work is known. This book shows the\r\nsure touch, the wide interests, the independent judgment, which we\r\nexpect. It shows, also, fine spirit and literary skill.... Coming to\r\nthe economic provisions of the Treaty, I find myself in general accord\r\nwith what Mr. Keynes says. He makes out an estimate of what Germany can\r\ndo in the way of reparation.... The maximum cannot, in his judgment,\r\nexceed ten billions of dollars. Some such figure, it is not improper\r\nto say, was reached independently by Professor A. A. Young in his\r\nestimates for the American financial advisers.”\r\n\r\n_FINANCIAL WORLD_, New York City, Feb. 16, 1920.—“There is a thousand\r\ndollars of information in it for the average business man.”\r\n\r\nFRANK A. VANDERLIP in _CHICAGO NEWS_, March 3, 1920.—“I regard it\r\nas the most important volume published since the Armistice. It is\r\ncertain to have a profound effect on world thought. It is a deep\r\nanalysis of the economic structure of Europe at the outbreak of the\r\nwar, a brilliant characterisation of the Peace Conference, a revealing\r\nanalysis of the shortcomings of the Treaty, a dissection of the\r\nreparation claims, done with the scientific spirit and steadiness of\r\nhand of a great surgeon, a vision of Europe after the Treaty, which is\r\nthe most illuminating picture that has yet been made of the immediate\r\nsituation on the Continent, and, finally, constructive remedial\r\nproposals. Every chapter bears the imprint of a master hand, of a mind\r\ntrained to translate economic data, and of absolutely unfaltering\r\ncourage to tell the truth.”\r\n\r\nALVIN JOHNSON in the _NEW REPUBLIC_, April 14, 1920.—“There has been\r\nno failure anywhere to recognise that Keynes’s _Economic Consequences\r\nof the Peace_ requires an ‘answer.’ Too many complacencies have been\r\nassailed by it.... What progress are his critics making in their\r\nattack on it?... There is surprisingly little effort made by American\r\nreviewers to refute the charge that the Treaty is in many respects\r\nin direct violation of the preliminary engagements, nor is anywhere\r\na serious attempt made to show that those engagements were not\r\nmorally binding.... The critics have not seriously shaken Keynes’s\r\ncharacterization of the Treaty. They have not been able to get far away\r\nfrom agreement with him as to what the Treaty should have been. They\r\nadmit the desirability of revision.”\r\n\r\n_DETROIT FREE PRESS_, Nov. 21, 1921.—“Only once have I seen Viviani\r\ngo into action gradually. It was after his last trip to the United\r\nStates. He was talking in a subdued conversational tone when suddenly\r\nhe thought of John Maynard Keynes’s book, _The Economic Consequences\r\nof the Peace_. His face, hitherto motionless, twitched a little. His\r\nwords accelerated slowly. The current of his emotion spread curiously\r\nthrough the muscles of his whole body, until the figure which had been\r\nrelaxed from head to foot became tense in every fibre. In a moment he\r\nwas denouncing, with the sonorous blast of his anger, the book which\r\nhe said he had encountered in every country in the New World, as ‘a\r\nmonument of iniquity,’ a monster which confronted him everywhere in\r\nSouth or North America, and which for some (to him) incredible reason\r\neveryone seemed to believe as the gospel truth about the pact of\r\nVersailles.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE\r\n\r\n-Plain print and punctuation errors fixed.\r\n\r\n-Table at page 238 has been splitted into two tables, because of its large\r\n dimension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's A Revision of the Treaty, by John Maynard Keynes",
