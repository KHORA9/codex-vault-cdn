THOMAS KEARNS,\r\nOF UTAH,\r\n\r\nIN THE\r\nSENATE OF THE UNITED STATES,\r\n\r\nTuesday, February 28, 1905.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON.\r\n1905.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH OF HON. THOMAS KEARNS.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPOLYGAMOUS MARRIAGES AND PLURAL COHABITATION.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair lays before the Senate the\r\nresolution submitted by the Senator from Idaho [Mr. DUBOIS],\r\nwhich will be read.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary read the resolution submitted yesterday by Mr.\r\nDUBOIS, as follows:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the Committee on the Judiciary be, and it is\r\n     hereby, authorized and instructed to prepare and report to the\r\n     Senate within thirty days after the beginning of the next\r\n     session of Congress a joint resolution of the two Houses of\r\n     Congress proposing to the several States amendments to the\r\n     Constitution of the United States which shall provide, in\r\n     substance, for the prohibition and punishment of polygamous\r\n     marriages and plural cohabitation contracted or practiced\r\n     within the United States and in every place subject to the\r\n     jurisdiction of the United States; and which shall, in\r\n     substance, also require all persons taking office under the\r\n     Constitution or laws of the United States, or of any State, to\r\n     take and subscribe an oath that he or she is not, and will not\r\n     be, a member or adherent of any organization whatever the laws,\r\n     rules, or nature of which organization require him or her to\r\n     disregard his or her duty to support and maintain the\r\n     Constitution and laws of the United States and of the several\r\n     States.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. KEARNS. Mr. President, I will not permit this occasion to pass\r\nwithout saying, with brevity and such clearness as I can command, what\r\nit seems to me should be said by a Senator, under these circumstances,\r\nbefore leaving public life. Something is due to the State which has\r\nhonored me; something is due to the record which I have endeavored to\r\nmaintain honorably before the world and something, by way of\r\ninformation, is due to the Senate and the country.\r\n\r\nUtah, the newest of the States, to me the best beloved of all the\r\nStates, appears to be the only one concerning which there is a serious\r\nconflict with the country. I was not born in Utah, but I have spent all\r\nthe years of my manhood there, and I love the Commonwealth and its\r\npeople. In what I say there is malice toward none, and I hope to make it\r\njust to all. If the present day does not accept my statements and\r\nappreciate my motives, I can only trust that time will prove more gentle\r\nand that in the future those who care to revert to these remarks will\r\nknow that they are animated purely by a hope to bring about a better\r\nunderstanding between Utah and this great nation.\r\n\r\nUtah was admitted to statehood after, and because of, a long series of\r\npledges exacted from the Mormon leaders, the like of which had never\r\nbefore been known in American history. Except for those pledges, the\r\nsentiment of the United States would never have assented to Utah's\r\nadmission. Except for the belief on the part of Congress and the country\r\nthat the extraordinary power which abides in that State would maintain\r\nthese pledges, Utah would not have been admitted. There is every reason\r\nto believe that the President who signed the bill would have vetoed it\r\nif he had not been convinced that the pledges made would be kept.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PLEDGES.\r\n\r\nAs a citizen of the State and a witness to the events and words which\r\nconstitute those pledges, as a Senator of the United States, I give my\r\nword of honor to you that I believed that these pledges consisted of the\r\nfollowing propositions:\r\n\r\nFirst. That the Mormon leaders would live within the laws pertaining to\r\nplural marriage and the continued plural marriage relation, and that\r\nthey would enforce this obligation upon all of their followers, under\r\npenalty of disfellowship.\r\n\r\nSecond. That the leaders of the Mormon Church would no longer exercise\r\npolitical sway, and that their followers would be free and would\r\nexercise their freedom in politics, in business, and in social affairs.\r\n\r\nAs a citizen and a Senator I give my word of honor to you that I\r\nbelieved that these pledges would be kept in the spirit in which\r\nCongress and the country accepted them, and that there would never be\r\nany violation, evasion, denial, or equivocation concerning them.\r\n\r\nI appeal to such members of this body as were in either House of\r\nCongress during the years 1890 to 1896, if it was not their belief at\r\nthat time that the foregoing were the pledges and that they would be\r\nkept; and I respectfully insist that every Senator here who was a member\r\nof either House at that time would have refused to vote for Utah's\r\nadmission unless he had firmly believed as I have stated.\r\n\r\n1. Utah, secured her statehood by a solemn compact made by the Mormon\r\nleaders in behalf of themselves and their people.\r\n\r\n2. That compact has been broken willfully and frequently.\r\n\r\n3. No apostle of the Mormon Church has publicly protested against that\r\nviolation.\r\n\r\nI know the gravity of the utterances that I have just made. I know what\r\nare the probable consequences to myself. But I have pondered long and\r\nearnestly upon the subject and have come to the conclusion that duty to\r\nthe innocent people of my State and that obligation to the Senate and\r\nthe country require that I shall clearly define my attitude.\r\n\r\n\r\nRELIGION NOT INVOLVED.\r\n\r\nThis is no quarrel with religion. This is no assault upon any man's\r\nfaith. This is rather the reverence toward the inherent right of all men\r\nto believe as they please, which separates religious faith from\r\nirreligious practice. The Mormon people have a system of their own,\r\nsomewhat complex, and gathered from the mysticisms of all the ages. It\r\ndoes not appeal to most men; but in its purely theological domain it is\r\ntheirs, and I respect it as their religion and them as its believers.\r\n\r\nThe trouble arises now, as it has frequently arisen in the past, from\r\nthe fact that some of the accidental leaders of the movement since the\r\nfirst zealot founder have sought to make of this religion not only a\r\nsystem of morals, sometimes quite original in themselves, but also a\r\nsystem of social relation, a system of finance, a system of commerce,\r\nand a system of politics.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOCIAL ASPECT.\r\n\r\nI dismiss the religion with my profound respect; if it can comfort them,\r\nI would not, if I could, disturb it. Coming to the social aspect of the\r\nsociety, it is apparent that the great founder sought first to establish\r\nequality among men, and then to draw from those equal ranks a special\r\nclass, who were permitted to practice polygamy and to whom special\r\nprivileges were accorded in their association with the consecrated\r\ntemples and the administration of mystic ordinances therein. The\r\npolygamous group, or cult as it may be called, soon became the ruling\r\nfactor in the organization; and it may be observed that ever since the\r\nfounding of the church almost every man of prominence in the community\r\nhas belonged to this order. It was so in the time of the martyrs, Joseph\r\nand Hyrum Smith, who were killed at Carthage jail in Illinois, and both\r\nof whom were polygamists, although it was denied at the time. There were\r\nliving until recently, and perhaps there are living now, women who\r\ntestified that they were married in polygamy to one or the other of\r\nthese two men, Joseph having the larger number. It has been so ever\r\nsince and is so to-day that nearly every man of the governing class has\r\nbeen or is a polygamist.\r\n\r\nBrigham Young succeeded Joseph Smith, and he set up a kind of kingly\r\nrulership, not unbecoming to a man of his vast empire-building power.\r\nThe Mormons have been taught to revere Joseph Smith as a direct prophet\r\nfrom God. He saw the face of the All Father. He held communion with the\r\nSon. The Holy Ghost was his constant companion. He settled every\r\nquestion, however trivial, by revelation from Almighty God. But Brigham\r\nwas different. While claiming a divine right of leadership, he worked\r\nout his great mission by palpable and material means. I do not know that\r\nhe ever pretended to have received a revelation from the time that he\r\nleft Nauvoo until he reached the shores of the Dead Sea, nor through all\r\nthe thirty years of his leadership there. He seemed to regard his people\r\nas children who had to be led through their serious calamities by\r\nholding out to them the glittering thought of divine guardianship. So\r\nfirmly did Brigham establish the social order in Utah that all of the\r\npeople were equal, except the governing body. This may be said to\r\nconsist of the president and his two counsellors, they three\r\nconstituting the first presidency; the twelve apostles; the presiding\r\nbishopric, consisting of three men, the chief bishops of the church but\r\nmuch lower in rank than the apostles; the seven presidents of seventies,\r\nwho are, under the apostles, the subordinate head of the missionary\r\nservice of the church; and the presiding patriarch. These altogether\r\nconstitute a body of twenty-six men. There are local authorities in the\r\ndifferent stakes of Zion, as they are called, corresponding to counties\r\nin a State, but with these it is not necessary to deal.\r\n\r\nPractically all of these men under Brigham Young were polygamists. They\r\nconstituted what one of their number once called the \"elite class\" of\r\nthe community. To attain this rank one usually had to show ability, and\r\nattaining the rank he was quite certain to enter into or extend his\r\nalready existing plural-marriage relations. These rulers were looked\r\nupon with great reverence. Brigham Young, besides being a prophet of\r\nGod, as they believed, had led them through the greatest march of the\r\nages. His nod became almost superhuman in its significance. His frown\r\nwas as terrible to them as the wrath of God. He upheld all the members\r\nof the polygamistic and governing class by his favoritism toward them.\r\nHe supremely, and they subordinately, ruled the community as if they\r\nwere a king and a house of peers, with no house of commons. Not\r\nelsewhere in the United States, and not in any foreign country where\r\ncivilization dwells, has there been such a complete mastery of man over\r\nmodern men. The subordinates and the mass would perform the slightest\r\nwill of Brigham Young. When he was not present the mass would perform\r\nthe will of any of the subordinates speaking in his name. Below this\r\nprivileged class stood the common mass. It had its various gradations of\r\ntitle, but, with the exception of rare instances of personal power,\r\nthere was equality in the mass. For instance, as business was a part of\r\ntheir system, the local religious authority in some remote part might be\r\nthe business subordinate of some other man of less ecclesiastical rank,\r\nwith the result that this peculiar intermingling kept them all\r\npractically upon one level of social order; and the man who made adobes\r\nunder the hot sun of the desert through all the week might still be the\r\nreligious superior of the richest man in the local community, and they\r\nmet on terms of equality and friendship. Their children might\r\nintermarry, the difference in wealth being countervailed by a difference\r\nin ecclesiastical authority.\r\n\r\nIt was a strange social system, this, with Brigham Young and his coterie\r\nof advisers, to the number of twenty-six, standing at the head,\r\nself-perpetuating, the chief being able to select constantly to fill the\r\nranks as they might be depleted by death; and all these ruling over one\r\nsolid mass of equal caste who thought that the rulers were animated by\r\ndivine revelation, holding the right to govern in all things on earth\r\nand with authority extending into heaven.\r\n\r\nSo firmly intrenched was their social system that when Brigham Young\r\npassed away his various successors who came in time to his place by\r\naccident of seniority of service found ample opportunity without\r\ndifficulty to perpetuate this system and to maintain their social\r\nautocracy. As the matter has appeared so fully before the country, I\r\nwill not speak further of the method of succession, but will merely call\r\nto your minds that after Brigham Young came John Taylor, then Wilford\r\nWoodruff, then Lorenzo Snow, then Joseph F. Smith, the present ruler.\r\n\r\nUnder these several men the social autocracy has had its varying\r\nfortunes, but at the present time it is probably at as high a point as\r\nit ever reached under the original Joseph or under Brigham Young. The\r\npresident of the church, Joseph F. Smith, affects a regal state. His\r\nhome consists of a series of villas, rather handsome in design, and\r\nsurrounded by such ample grounds as to afford sufficient exclusiveness.\r\nIn addition to this he has an official residence of historic character\r\nnear to the office which he occupies as president. When he travels he is\r\nusually accompanied by a train of friends, who are really servitors.\r\nWhen he attends social functions he appears like a ruler among his\r\nsubjects. And in this respect I am not speaking of Mormon associations\r\nalone, for there are many Gentiles in and out of Utah who seem to take\r\ndelight in paying this extraordinary deference.\r\n\r\nIf I have seemed to speak at length upon this mere social phase it has\r\nnot been without a definite purpose. I want you to know how this\r\nreligion, claiming to recognize and secure the equality of men,\r\nimmediately established and has maintained for the mass of its adherents\r\nthat social equality, but has elevated a class of its rulers to regal\r\nauthority and splendor. Understanding how the chief among them has the\r\ndignity of a monarch in their social relations, you will better\r\nunderstand the business and political autocracy which he has been able\r\nto establish.\r\n\r\nIn all this social system each apostle has his great part. He is\r\ninseparable from it. He wields now, as does a minister at court, such\r\npart of the power as the monarch may permit him to enjoy, and it is his\r\nhope and expectation that he will outlive those who are his seniors in\r\nrank in order that he may become the ruler.\r\n\r\nTherefore, if there be evil in this social relation as I have portrayed\r\nit, every apostle is responsible for a part of that evil. They enjoy the\r\nhonors of the social class; they help to exert the tyranny over the\r\nsubjugated mass. Those of you who do me the honor to follow my remarks\r\nwill realize how close is the relation between the apostles and the\r\npresident, and that the apostle is a responsible part of the governing\r\npower. While I may speak of the president of the church segregated from\r\nhis associates and as the monarch, it must be understood constantly that\r\nhe maintains his power by the support of the apostles, who keep the mass\r\nin order and in subjugation to his will, expressed through them.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BUSINESS MONOPOLY.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been its origin or excuse, the business power of the\r\npresident of the church and of the select class which he admits into\r\nbusiness relations with him is now a practical monopoly, or is rapidly\r\nbecoming a monopoly, of everything that he touches. I want to call your\r\nattention to the extraordinary list of worldly concerns in which this\r\nspiritual leader holds official position. The situation is more amazing\r\nwhen you are advised that this man came to his presidency purely by\r\naccident, namely, the death of his seniors in rank; that he had never\r\nknown any business ability, and that he comes to the presidency and the\r\ndirectorship of the various corporations solely because he is president\r\nof the church. He is already reputed to be a wealthy man, and his\r\nstatement would seem to indicate that he has large holdings in the\r\nvarious corporations with which he is associated, although previous to\r\nhis accession to the presidency of the church he made a kind of proud\r\nboast among his people of his poverty.\r\n\r\nHe conducts railways, street-car lines, power and light companies, coal\r\nmines, salt works, sugar factories, shoe factories, mercantile houses,\r\ndrug stores, newspapers, magazines, theaters, and almost every\r\nconceivable kind of business, and in all of these, inasmuch as he is the\r\ndominant factor by virtue of his being the prophet of God, he asserts\r\nindisputable sway. It is considered an evidence of deference to him, and\r\ngood standing in the church, for his hundreds of thousands of followers\r\nto patronize exclusively the institutions which he controls.\r\n\r\nAnd this fact alone, without any business ability on his part, but with\r\ncapable subordinate guidance for his enterprises, insures their success,\r\nand danger and possible ruin for every competitive enterprise.\r\nIndependent of these business concerns, he is in receipt of an income\r\nlike unto that which a royal family derives from a national treasury.\r\nOne-tenth of all the annual earnings of all the Mormons in all the world\r\nflows to him. These funds amount to the sum of $1,000,000 annually, or 5\r\nper cent upon $32,000,000, which is one-quarter of the entire taxable\r\nwealth of the State of Utah. It is the same as if he owned,\r\nindividually, in addition to all his visible enterprises, one-quarter of\r\nall the wealth of the State and derived from it 5 per cent of income\r\nwithout taxation and without discount. The hopelessness of contending in\r\na business way with this autocrat must be perfectly apparent to your\r\nminds. The original purpose of this vast tithe, as often stated by\r\nspeakers for the church, was the maintenance of the poor, the building\r\nof meetinghouses, etc. To-day the tithes are transmuted, in the\r\nlocalities where they are paid, into cash, and they flow into the\r\ntreasury of the head of the church. No account is made, or ever has been\r\nmade, of these tithes. The president expends them according to his own\r\nwill and pleasure, and with no examination of his accounts, except by\r\nthose few men whom he selects for that purpose and whom he rewards for\r\ntheir zeal and secrecy. Shortly after the settlement of the Mormon\r\nChurch property question with the United States the church issued a\r\nseries of bonds, amounting approximately to $1,000,000, which were taken\r\nby financial institutions. This was probably to wipe out a debt which\r\nhad accumulated during a long period of controversy with the nation. But\r\nsince, and including the year 1897, which was about the time of the\r\nissue of the bonds, approximately $9,000,000 have been paid as tithes.\r\nIf any of the bonds are still outstanding, it is manifestly because the\r\npresident of the church desires for reasons of his own to have an\r\nexisting indebtedness.\r\n\r\nIt will astound you to know that every dollar of United States money\r\npaid to any servant of the Government who is a Mormon is tithed for the\r\nbenefit of this monarch. Out of every $1,000 thus paid he gets $100 to\r\nswell his grandeur. This is also true of money paid out of the public\r\ntreasury of the State of Utah to Mormon officials. But what is worst of\r\nall, the monarch dips into the sacred public school fund and extracts\r\nfrom every Mormon teacher one-tenth of his or her earnings and uses it\r\nfor his unaccounted purposes; and, by means of these purposes and the\r\npower which they constitute, he defies the laws of his State, the\r\nsentiment of his country, and is waging war of nullification on the\r\npublic school system, so dear to the American people. No right-thinking\r\nman will oppose any person as a servant of the nation or the State or as\r\na teacher in the public schools on account of religious faith. As I have\r\nbefore remarked, this is no war upon the religion of the Mormons; and I\r\nam only calling attention to the monstrous manner in which this monarch\r\ninvades all the provinces of human life and endeavors to secure his\r\nrapacious ends.\r\n\r\nIn all this there is no thought on my part of opposition to voluntary\r\ngifts by individuals for religious purposes or matters connected\r\nlegitimately with religion. My comment and criticism are against the\r\ntyranny which misuses a sacred name to extract from individuals the\r\nmoneys which they ought not to spare from family needs, and which they\r\ndo not wish to spare; my comment and criticism relate to the power of a\r\nmonarch whose tyranny is so effective as that not even the moneys paid\r\nby the Government are considered the property of the Government's\r\nservant until after this monarch shall have seized his arbitrary\r\ntribute, with or without the willing assent of the victim, so that the\r\nmonarch may engage the more extensively in commercial affairs, which are\r\nnot a part of either religion or charity.\r\n\r\nWith an income of 5 per cent upon one-quarter of the entire assessed\r\nvaluation of the State of Utah to-day, how long will it take this\r\nmonarch, with his constantly increasing demands for revenue, to so\r\nabsorb the productive power that he shall be receiving an income of 5\r\nper cent upon one-half the property, and then upon all of the property\r\nof the State? This is worse than the farming of taxes under the old\r\nFrench Kings. Will Congress allow this awful calamity to continue?\r\n\r\nThe view which the people of the United States entertained on this\r\nsubject forty years ago was shown by the act of Congress in 1802, in\r\nwhich a provision, directed particularly against the Mormon Church,\r\ndeclared that no church in a Territory of the United States should have\r\nin excess of $50,000 of wealth outside of the property used for purposes\r\nof worship. It is evident that as early as that time the pernicious\r\neffects of a system which used the name of God and the authority of\r\nreligion to dominate in commerce and finance were fully recognized.\r\n\r\nThis immense tithing fund is gathered directly from Mormons, but the\r\nburden falls in some degree upon Gentiles also. Gentiles are in business\r\nand suffer by competition with tithe-supported business enterprises.\r\nGentiles are large employers of Mormon labor; and as that labor must pay\r\none-tenth of its earnings to support competitive concerns, the Gentile\r\nemployer must pay, indirectly at least, the tithe which may be utilized\r\nto compete with, and even ruin, him in business.\r\n\r\nAnd in return it should be noted that Mormon institutions do not employ\r\nGentiles except in rare cases of necessity. The reason is obvious:\r\nGentiles do not take as kindly to the tithing system as do the Mormons.\r\n\r\nThe Mormon citizen of Utah has additional disadvantages. After paying\r\none-tenth of all his earnings as a tithe offering, he is called upon to\r\nerect and maintain the meetinghouses and other edifices of the church;\r\nhe is called upon to donate to the poor fund in his ward, through his\r\nlocal bishop; he is called upon to sustain the Women's Relief Society,\r\nwhose purpose is to care for the poor and to minister to the sick; he is\r\ncalled upon to pay his share of the expense for the 2,500 missionaries\r\nof the church who are constantly kept in the field without drawing\r\nupon, the general funds of the church. When all this is done, it is\r\nfound that, in defiance of the old and deserved boast of the\r\npredecessors of the present president, there are some Mormons in the\r\npoorhouses of Utah, and these are sustained by the public taxes derived\r\nfrom the Gentiles and Mormons alike.\r\n\r\nBroadly speaking, the Gentiles compose 35 per cent of the population and\r\npay one-half of the taxes of Utah. In the long run they carry their\r\nshare of all these great charges.\r\n\r\nThe almost unbearable community burden which is thus inflicted must be\r\nvisible to your minds without argument from me.\r\n\r\nLet it be sufficient on this point for me to say that all the property\r\nof Utah is made to contribute to the grandeur of the president of the\r\nchurch, and that at his instance any industry, any institution, within\r\nthe State, could be destroyed except the mining and smelting industry.\r\nEven this industry his personal and church organ has attacked with a\r\nthreat of extermination by the courts, or by additional legislation, if\r\nthe smelters do not meet the view expressed by the church organ.\r\n\r\nMr. President, I ask to have read at this point an editorial from the\r\nDeseret Evening News of October 31, 1904, which I send to the desk.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Secretary will read as requested.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary read as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nDESERET EVENING NEWS.\r\n\r\n[Organ of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.]\r\n\r\n     SALT LAKE CITY, _October 31, 1904_.\r\n\r\n     AWAY WITH THE NUISANCE.\r\n\r\n     The people of Salt Lake City are waking up to the realization\r\n     of the trouble of which our cousins out in the country are\r\n     complaining. The sulphurous fumes which have been tasted by\r\n     many folks here, particularly late at night, are not only those\r\n     of a partisan nature emanating from the smokestacks of the\r\n     slanderers and maligners, but are treats bestowed upon our\r\n     citizens by the smelters, and are samples of the goods, or\r\n     rather evils, which farmers and horticulturists have been\r\n     burdened with so long. Complaints have come to us from some of\r\n     the best people of the city, of different faiths and parties,\r\n     that the air has been laden with sulphurous fumes that can net\r\n     only be felt in the throat, but tasted in the mouth, and they\r\n     rest upon the city at night, appearing like a thin fog.\r\n\r\n     The fact is this smelter smoke will have to go; there is no\r\n     mistake about that. If the smelters can not consume it, they\r\n     will have to close up. This fair county must not be devastated\r\n     and this city must not be rendered unhealthful by any such a\r\n     nuisance as that which has been borne with now for a long time.\r\n     The evasive policy that has been pursued, the tantalizing\r\n     treatment toward the farmers who have vainly sought for\r\n     redress, the destruction that has come upon vegetation and upon\r\n     live stock, and now the choking fumes that reach this city all\r\n     demand some practical remedy in place of the shilly-shally of\r\n     the past.\r\n\r\n     The Deseret News has counseled peace, consideration for the\r\n     smelter people in the difficulties that they have to meet,\r\n     favor toward a valuable industry that should be encouraged on\r\n     proper lines, and arbitration instead of litigation. But it\r\n     really seems now as though an aggressive policy will have to be\r\n     pursued, or ruin will come to the agricultural pursuits of Salt\r\n     Lake County, while the city will not escape from the ravages of\r\n     the smelter fiend. If the companies that control those works\r\n     will not or can not dispose of the poisonous metallic fumes\r\n     that pour out of their smokestacks, the fires will have to he\r\n     banked and the nuisance suppressed. We do not believe the\r\n     latter is the necessary alternative. We are of opinion that the\r\n     evil can be disposed of, and we are sure that efforts ought to\r\n     be made to effect it without further delay.\r\n\r\n     It looks as if the courts will have to be appealed to to obtain\r\n     compensation for damages already inflicted. Also that they will\r\n     have to be applied to for injunctions against the continuance\r\n     of the cause of the trouble. We think there is law enough now\r\n     to proceed under. But if that is not the case, then legislation\r\n     must be had to fully cover the ground. Litigation will have to\r\n     come first, legislation afterwards. However that may be,\r\n     temporizing with the evil will not do. Patience has ceased to\r\n     be a virtue in this matter. The conviction is fastening itself\r\n     upon the public mind that no active steps are intended by the\r\n     responsible parties, but simply a policy of delay. They must be\r\n     taught that this will not answer the purpose, and that the\r\n     injured people will not be fooled in that way. The smelter\r\n     smoke must go. And it must not go in the old way.\r\n\r\n     The proposition to put the matter in the hands of experts\r\n     chosen by the complainants is not to be seriously considered.\r\n     The onus is upon the smelter men; they are the offenders, and\r\n     they must take the steps necessary to remove the cause of\r\n     complaint, and also reimburse those who have been injured. We\r\n     do not ask anything unreasonable. We join with those of our\r\n     citizens who Intend that this beautiful part of our lovely\r\n     State shall not be laid waste, even if the only cure is the\r\n     suppression of the destroying cause. This may as well be\r\n     understood first as last. Useless practical measures are\r\n     adopted to abate the evil, active proceedings will have to be\r\n     taken and pushed to the utmost to remove entirely the root and\r\n     branch and trunk and body of this tree of destruction. The\r\n     people affected are deeply in earnest, and they certainly mean\r\n     business.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. KEARNS. Mr. President, I must not burden you with too many details,\r\nbut in order for you to see how complete is the business power of this\r\nman I will cite you to one case. The Great Salt Lake is estimated to\r\ncontain 14,000,000,000 tons of salt. Probably salt can be made cheaper\r\non the shores of this lake than anywhere else in the world. Nearly all\r\nits shore line is adaptable for salt gardens. The president of the\r\nchurch is interested in a large salt monopoly which has gathered in the\r\nvarious smaller enterprises. He is president of a railroad which runs\r\nfrom the salt gardens to Salt Lake City, connecting there with trunk\r\nlines. It costs to manufacture the salt and place it on board the cars\r\n75 cents per ton. He receives for it $5 and $6 per ton. His company and\r\nits subsidiary corporation are probably capitalized at three-quarters of\r\na million dollars, and upon this large sum he is able to pay dividends\r\nof 8 or 10 per cent.\r\n\r\nNot long since two men, who for many years had been tithe payers and\r\nloyal members of the church, undertook to establish a salt garden along\r\nthe line of a trunk railway. One of them was a large dealer in salt, and\r\nproposed to extend his trade by making the salt and reaching territory\r\nprohibited to him by the church price of salt; the other was the owner\r\nof the land upon which it was proposed to establish the salt garden.\r\nThese men formed a corporation, put in pumping stations and flumes, and\r\nthe corporation became indebted to one of the financial institutions\r\nover which the church exercised considerable influence. Then the\r\npresident of the church sent for them. There is scarcely an instance on\r\nrecord where a message of this kind failed of its purpose. These men\r\nwent to meet the prophet, seer, and revelator of God, as they supposed,\r\nbut he had laid aside his robes of sanctity for the moment and he was a\r\nplain, unadorned, aggressive, if not an able, business man. He first\r\ndenounced them for interfering with a business which he had made\r\npeculiarly his own; and, when they protested that they had no intention\r\nto interfere with his trade, but were seeking new markets, he declared\r\nin a voice of thunderous passion that if they did not cease with their\r\nprojected enterprise, he would crush them. They escaped from his\r\npresence feeling like courtiers repulsed from the foot of a king's\r\nthrone, and then surveyed their enterprise. If they stopped, they would\r\nlose all the money invested and their enterprise would possibly be sold\r\nout to their creditors; if they went on and invested more money, the\r\npresident had the power, as he had threatened, to crush them. Not only\r\ncould he ruin their enterprise, but he could ostracise them socially and\r\ncould make of them marked and shunned men in the community where they\r\nhad always been respected.\r\n\r\nIs there menace in this system? To me it seems like a great danger to\r\nall the people who are now affected, and therefore of great danger to\r\nthe people of the United States, because the power of this monarchy\r\nwithin the Republic is constantly extending. If it be an evil, every\r\napostle is in part responsible for this tyrannical course. He helped to\r\nelect the president; he does the president's bidding, and shares in the\r\nadvantages of that tyranny.\r\n\r\nI did not call the social system a violation of the pledges to the\r\ncountry, but I do affirm that the business tyranny of Mormon leaders is\r\nan express violation of the covenant made, for they do not leave their\r\nfollowers free in secular affairs. They tyrannize over them, and their\r\ntyranny spreads even to the Gentiles. In all this I charge that every\r\napostle is a party to the wrong and to the violation. Although I speak\r\nof the president of the church as the leader, the monarch in fact, every\r\napostle is one of his ministers, one of his creators, and also one of\r\nhis creatures, and possibly his successor; and the whole system depends\r\nupon the manner in which the apostles and the other leaders shall\r\nsupport the chief leader. As no apostle has ever protested against this\r\nsystem, but has, by every means in his power, encouraged it, he can not\r\nescape his share of the responsibility for it. It is an evil; they aid\r\nit. It is a violation of the pledge upon which statehood was granted;\r\nthey profit by it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POLITICAL AUTOCRACY.\r\n\r\nI pass now to the political aspect of this hierarchy, as some call it,\r\nbut this monarchy as I choose to term it.\r\n\r\nI have previously called your attention to the social and business\r\npowers, monopolies, autocracies, exercised by the leaders. Through these\r\nchannels of social and business relations they can spread the knowledge\r\nof their political desires without appearing obtrusively in politics.\r\nWhen the end of their desire is accomplished, they affect to wash their\r\nhands of all responsibility by denying that they engaged in political\r\nactivities. Superficial persons, and those desiring to accept this\r\nargument, are convinced by it. But never, in the palmy days of Brigham\r\nYoung, was there a more complete political tyranny than is exercised by\r\nthe present president of the Mormon Church and his apostles, who are\r\nmerely awaiting the time when by the death of their seniors in rank they\r\nmay become president, and select some other man to hold the apostleship\r\nin their place--as they now hold it in behalf of the ruling monarch.\r\n\r\nIn this statement I merely call your attention to what a perfect system\r\nof ecclesiastical government is maintained by these presidents and\r\napostles; and I do not need to more than indicate to you what a\r\nwonderous aid their ecclesiastical government can be, and is, in\r\naccomplishing their political purposes.\r\n\r\nParties are nothing to these leaders, except as parties may be used by\r\nthem. So long as there is Republican administration and Congress, they\r\nwill lead their followers to support Republican tickets; but if, by any\r\nchance, the Democratic party should control this Government, with a\r\nprospect of continuance in power, you would see a gradual veering around\r\nunder the direction of the Mormon leaders. When Republicans are in power\r\nthe Republican leaders of the Mormon people are in evidence and the\r\nDemocratic leaders are in retirement. If the Democracy were in power,\r\nthe Republican leaders of the Mormon people would go into retirement and\r\nDemocrats would appear in their places. No man can be elected to either\r\nHouse of Congress against their wish. I will not trespass upon your\r\npatience long enough to recite the innumerable circumstances that prove\r\nthis assertion, but will merely refer to enough instances to illustrate\r\nthe method. In 1897, at the session of the legislature which was to\r\nelect a Senator, and which was composed of sixty Democrats and three\r\nRepublicans, Moses Thacher was the favored candidate of the Democracy in\r\nthe State. He had been an apostle of the Mormon Church, but had been\r\ndeposed because he was out of harmony with the leaders. The Hon. Jos. L.\r\nRawlins was a rival candidate, but not strongly so at first. He was\r\nencouraged by the church leaders in every way; and finally, when his\r\nstrength had been advanced sufficiently to need but one vote, a Mormon\r\nRepublican was promptly moved over into the Democratic column and he was\r\nelected by the joint assembly. I do not charge that Hon. Joseph L.\r\nRawlins, who occupied a seat with distinguished honor in this great body\r\nfor six years, had any improper bargain with the church, or any\r\nknowledge of the secret methods by which his election was being\r\ncompassed; but he was elected under the direction of the leaders of the\r\nchurch because they desired to defeat and further humiliate a deposed\r\napostle.\r\n\r\nI will not ignore my own case. During nearly three years I have waited\r\nthis great hour of justice in which I could answer the malignant\r\nfalsehood and abuse which has been heaped upon a man who is dead and can\r\nnot answer, and upon myself, a living man willing to wait the time for\r\nanswer. Lorenzo Snow, a very aged man, was president of the church when\r\nI was elected to the Senate. He had reached that advanced time of life,\r\nbeing over eighty, when men abide largely in the thoughts of their\r\nyouth. He was my friend in that distant way which sometimes exists\r\nwithout close acquaintanceship, our friendship (if I may term it such)\r\nhaving arisen from the events attendant upon Utah's struggle for\r\nstatehood. For some reason he did not oppose my election to the Senate.\r\nEvery other candidate for the place had sought his favor; it came to me\r\nwithout price or solicitation on my part. The friends and mouthpieces of\r\nsome of the present leaders have been base enough to charge that I\r\nbought the Senatorship from Lorenzo Snow, president of their own church.\r\nHere and now I denounce the calumny against that old man, whose unsought\r\nand unbought favor came to me in that contest. That I ever paid him one\r\ndollar of money, or asked him to influence legislators of his faith, is\r\nas cruel a falsehood as ever came from human lips. So far as I am\r\nconcerned he held his power with clean hands, and I would protect the\r\nmemory of this dead man against all the abuse and misrepresentation\r\nwhich might be heaped upon him by those who were his adherents during\r\nlife, but who now attack his fame in order that they may pay the greater\r\ndeference to the present king.\r\n\r\nYou must know that in that day we were but five years old as a State.\r\nOur political conditions were and had been greatly unsettled. The\r\npurpose of the church to rule in politics had not yet been made so\r\nmanifest and determined. Lorenzo Snow held his office for a brief\r\ntime--about two years. What he did in that office pertaining to my\r\nelection I here and now distinctly assume as my burden, for no man shall\r\nwith impunity use his hatred of me to defame Lorenzo Snow and dishonor\r\nhis memory to his living and loving descendants.\r\n\r\nAs for myself, I am willing to take the Senate and the country into my\r\nconfidence, and make a part of the eternal records of the Senate, for\r\nsuch of my friends as may care to read, the vindication of my course to\r\nmy posterity. I had an ambition, and not an improper one, to sit in the\r\nSenate of the United States. My competitors had longer experience in\r\npolities and may have understood more of the peculiar situation in the\r\nState. They sought what is known as church influence. I sought to obtain\r\nthis place by purely political means. I was elected. After all their\r\ntrickery my opponents were defeated, and to some extent by the very\r\nmeans which they had basely invoked. I have served with you four years,\r\nand have sought in a modest way to make a creditable record here. I have\r\nlearned something of the grandeur and dignity of the Senate, something\r\nof its ideals, which I could not know before coming here. I say to you,\r\nmy fellow Senators, that this place of power is infinitely more\r\nmagnificent than I dreamed when I first thought of occupying a seat\r\nhere. But were it thrice as great as I now know it to be, and were I\r\nback in that old time of struggle in Utah, when I was seeking for this\r\nhonor, I would not permit the volunteered friendship of President Snow\r\nto bestow upon me, even as an innocent recipient, one atom of the church\r\nmonarch's favor. My ideals have grown with my term of service in this\r\nbody, and I believe that the man who would render here the highest\r\nservice to his country must be careful to attain to this place by the\r\npurest civic path that mortal feet can tread.\r\n\r\nI have said enough to indicate that for my own part I never\r\ncountenanced, nor knowingly condoned, the intrusion of the church\r\nmonarchy into secular affairs. And I have said enough to those who know\r\nme to prove for all time that, so far as I am concerned, my election\r\nhere was as honorable as that of any man who sits in this chamber; and\r\nyet I have said enough that all men may know that rather than have a\r\ndead man's memory defamed on my account, I will make his cause my own\r\nand will fight for the honor which he is not on earth to defend. This\r\nwill not suit the friends and mouthpieces of the present rulers, but I\r\nhave no desire to satisfy or conciliate them; and in leaving this part\r\nof the question, I avenge President Snow sufficiently by saying that\r\nthese men did not dare to offend his desire nor dispute his will while\r\nhe was living, and only grew brave when they could cry: \"Lorenzo, the\r\nking, is dead! Long live Joseph, the king!\"\r\n\r\nAs a Senator I have sought to fulfill my duty to the people of this\r\ncountry. I am about to retire from this place of dignity. No man can\r\nretain this seat from Utah and retain his self-respect after he\r\ndiscovers the methods by which his election is procured and the objects\r\nwhich the church monarchy intends to achieve. Some of my critics will\r\nsay that I relinquished that which I could not hold. I will not pause to\r\ndiscuss that point further than to say that if I had chosen to adopt the\r\npolicy with the present monarch of the church, which his friends and\r\nmouthpieces say I did adopt with the king who is dead, it might have\r\nbeen possible to retain this place of honor with dishonor.\r\n\r\nEvery apostle is a part of this terrible power, which can make and\r\nunmake at its mysterious will and pleasure. Early in 1902 warning had\r\nbeen publicly uttered in the State against the continued manifestation\r\nof church power in politics. The period of unsettled conditions during\r\nwhich I was elected had ended and we had opportunity to see the manner\r\nin which the church monarch was resuming his forbidden sway; and we had\r\noccasion to know the indignant feelings entertained by the people of the\r\nUnited States when they contemplated the flagrant breaking of the pledge\r\ngiven to the country to secure the admission of Utah. I myself, after\r\nconference with distinguished men at Washington, journeyed to Utah and\r\npresented a solemn protest and warning to the leaders of the church\r\nagainst the dangerous exercise of their political power. I did it to\r\nrepay a debt which I owed to Utah, and not for any selfish reason. I\r\nknew that from the day I uttered that warning the leaders of the Mormon\r\nChurch would hate and pursue me for the purpose of wreaking their\r\nvengeance. But as the consequences of their misconduct, their pledge\r\nbreaking would fall upon all of the people of the State, upon the\r\ninnocent more severely than upon the guilty, I felt that I must assert\r\nmy love and gratitude to the State, even though my warning should lead\r\nto my own destruction by these autocrats. If there had been one desire\r\nin my heart to effect a conjunction with this church monarchy, if I had\r\nbeen willing to retain office as its gift, I would not have taken this\r\nstep, for I knew its consequences. I began in that hour my effort to\r\nrestore to the people of Utah the safety and the political freedom which\r\nare their right, and I shall continue it while I live until the fight is\r\nwon.\r\n\r\nThe disdain with which that message was received was final proof of the\r\ncontempt in which that church monarchy holds the Senate and the people\r\nof the United States, and of the disregard in which the church monarchy\r\nholds the pledges which it made in order to obtain the power of\r\nstatehood.\r\n\r\nThey do not need to utter explicit instructions in order to assert their\r\ndemand. The methods of conveying information of their desire are\r\nnumerous and sufficiently effective, as is proved by results. To show\r\nhow completely all ordinary political conditions, as they obtain\r\nelsewhere in the United States, are without account in Utah, I have but\r\nto cite you to the fact that after the recent election, which gave 57\r\nmembers out of 63 on joint ballot to the Republican party, and when the\r\nquestion of my successor became a matter of great anxiety to numerous\r\naspirants for this place, the discussion was not concerning the fitness\r\nof candidates, nor the political popularity of the various gentlemen who\r\ncomposed that waiting list, nor the pledges of the legislators, but was\r\nlimited to the question as to who could stand best with the church\r\nmonarchy; as to whom it would like to use in this position; as to who\r\nwould make for the extension of its ambitions and power in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MORMON MARRIAGE RELATION.\r\n\r\nAnd now I come to a subject concerning which the people of the United\r\nStates are greatly aroused. It is known that there have been plural\r\nmarriages among the Mormon people, by sanction of high authorities in\r\nthis church monarchy, since the solemn promise was made to the country\r\nthat plural marriages should end. It is well known that the plural\r\nmarriage relations have been continued defiantly, according to the will\r\nand pleasure of those who had formerly violated the law, and for whose\r\nobedience to law the church monarchy pledged the faith and honor of its\r\nleaders and followers alike in order to obtain statehood. The pledge was\r\nmade repeatedly, as stated in an earlier part of these remarks, that all\r\nof the Mormon people would come within the law. They have not done so.\r\nThe church monarch is known to be living in defiance of the laws of God\r\nand man, and in defiance of the covenant made with the country, upon\r\nwhich amnesty by the President, and statehood by the President and the\r\nCongress, were granted.\r\n\r\nI charge that every apostle is in large part responsible for this\r\ncondition, so deplorable in its effects upon the people of Utah and so\r\nantagonistic to the institutions of this country. Every apostle is\r\ndirected by the law-breaking church monarch. Every apostle teaches by\r\nexample and precept to the Mormon people that this church monarch is a\r\nprophet of God, to offend or criticise whom is a sin in the sight of the\r\nAlmighty. Every apostle helps to appoint to office and sustain the seven\r\npresidents of seventies, who are below them in dignity, and they are\r\ndirectly responsible for them and their method of life.\r\n\r\nIt is quite evident that the church monarchy is endeavoring to\r\nreestablish the rule of a polygamous class over the mass of the Mormon\r\npeople. Of the apostles not practicing polygamy there is at most only\r\nthree or four men constituting the quorum of which this could be\r\ntruthfully said. Special reasons may exist in some particular case why a\r\nman in this class has not entered into such relation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL SITUATION.\r\n\r\nBriefly reviewing the matters which I have offered here, and the logical\r\ndeductions therefrom, I maintain the following propositions:\r\n\r\nWe set aside the religion of the Mormon people as sacred from assault.\r\n\r\nOutside of religion the Mormons as a community are ruled by a special\r\nprivileged class, constituting what I call the church monarchy.\r\n\r\nThis monarchy pledged the country that there would be no more violations\r\nof law and no more defiance of the sentiment of the United States\r\nregarding polygamy and the plural marriage relation.\r\n\r\nThis monarchy pledged the United States that it would refrain from\r\ncontrolling its subjects in secular affairs.\r\n\r\nEvery member of this monarchy is responsible for the system of\r\ngovernment and for the acts of the monarchy, since (as shown in the\r\ncases of the deposed apostle, Moses Thatcher, and others) the man who is\r\nnot in accord with the system is dropped from the ruling class.\r\n\r\nThis monarchy sets up a regal social order within this Republic.\r\n\r\nThis monarchy monopolizes the business of one commonwealth and is\r\nrapidly reaching into others.\r\n\r\nThis monarchy takes practically all the surplus product of the toil of\r\nits subjects for its own purpose, and makes no account to anyone on\r\nearth of its immense secret fund.\r\n\r\nThis monarchy rules all politics in Utah, and is rapidly extending its\r\ndominion into other States and Territories.\r\n\r\nThis monarchy permits its favorites to enter into polygamy and to\r\nmaintain polygamous relations, and it protects them from prosecution by\r\nits political power.\r\n\r\nLately no effort has been made to punish any of these people by the\r\nlocal law. On the contrary, the ruling monarch has continued to grow in\r\npower, wealth, and importance. He sits upon innumerable boards of\r\ndirectors, among others that of the Union Pacific Railway, where he\r\njoins upon terms of fraternity with the great financial and\r\ntransportation magnates of the United States, who hold him in their\r\ncouncils because his power to benefit or to injure their possessions\r\nmust be taken into account.\r\n\r\nI charge that no apostle has ever protested publicly against the\r\ncontinuation of this sovereign authority over the Mormon kingdom.\r\n\r\nWithin a few months past the last apostle elected to the quorum was a\r\npolygamist--Charles W. Penrose--and his law-breaking career is well\r\nknown. Previous to 1889 Penrose was living publicly with three wives.\r\nUnder false pretenses to President Cleveland he obtained amnesty for his\r\npast offenses. He represented that he had but two wives, and that he\r\nmarried his second wife in 1862, while it was generally known that he\r\ntook a third wife just prior to 1888. He promised to obey the law in the\r\nfuture, and to urge others to do so; yet after that amnesty, obtained by\r\nconcealing his third marriage from President Cleveland, he continued\r\nliving with his three wives. His action in this matter has been\r\nnotorious. He has publicly defended this kind of lawbreaking on the\r\nfalse pretense that there was a tacit understanding with the American\r\nCongress and people, when Utah was admitted, that these polygamists\r\nmight continue to live as they had been living.\r\n\r\nAnd it was this traitor to his country's laws, this unrepentant knave\r\nand cheat of the nation's mercy, this defamer of Congress and the\r\npeople, that was elected to the apostleship to help govern the church,\r\nand through the church the State.\r\n\r\nIs it not demonstrated that Utah is an abnormal State? Our problem is\r\nvast and complex. I have endeavored to simplify it so that the Senate\r\nand the country may readily grasp the questions at issue.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REMEDY.\r\n\r\nWill this great body, will the Government of the United States, go on\r\nunheedingly while this church monarchy multiplies its purposes and\r\nmultiplies its power? Has the nation so little regard for its own\r\ndignity and the safety of its institutions and its people that it will\r\npermit a church monarch like Joseph F. Smith to defy the laws of the\r\ncountry, and to override the law and to overrule the administrators of\r\nthe law in his own State of Utah?\r\n\r\nWhat shall the Americans of that Commonwealth do if the people of the\r\nUnited States do not heed their cry?\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of the Mormon people are law-abiding, industrious,\r\nsober, and thrifty. They make good citizens in every respect except as\r\nthey are dominated by this monarchy, which speaks to them in the name of\r\nGod and governs them in the spirit of Mammon. Any remedy for existing\r\nevils which would injure the mass of the Mormon people would be most\r\ndeplorable. I believe that they would loosen the chains which they wear\r\nif it were possible. I think that many of them pay blood-money tithes\r\nsimply to avoid social ostracism and business destruction. I believe\r\nthat many of them do the political will of the church monarch because\r\nthey are led to believe that the safety of the church monarchy is\r\nnecessary in order that the mass may preserve the right to worship God\r\naccording to the dictates of their conscience. The church monopoly, by\r\nits various agencies, is usually able to uprear the injured and innocent\r\nmass of the Mormon people as a barrier to protect the members of that\r\nmonarchy from public vengeance.\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of this great body--the Senate of the United States--to\r\nserve notice on this church monarch and his apostles that they must live\r\nwithin the law; that the nation is supreme; that the institutions of\r\nthis country must prevail throughout the land; and that the compact\r\nupon which statehood was granted must be preserved inviolate.\r\n\r\nMay heaven grant that this may be effective and that the church monarchy\r\nin Utah may be taught that it must relinquish its grasp.\r\n\r\nI would not, for my life, that injury should come to the innocent mass\r\nof the people of Utah; I would not that any right of theirs should be\r\nlost, but that the right of all should be preserved to all.\r\n\r\nIf the Senate will apply this remedy and the alien monarchy still proves\r\ndefiant, it will be for others than myself to suggest a course of action\r\nconsistent with the dignity of the country.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime we of Utah who have no sympathy with the now clearly\r\ndefined purpose of this church monopoly will wage our battle for\r\nindividual freedom; to lift the State to a proud position in the\r\nsisterhood, to preserve the compact which was made with the country,\r\nbelieving that behind the brave citizens in Utah who are warring against\r\nthis alien monarchy stands the sentiment and power of eighty-two\r\nmillions of our fellow-citizens.\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's Note: The following typographical errors were corrected:\r\ntryanny to tyranny, autocracts to autocrats, monorchy to monarchy.]",
