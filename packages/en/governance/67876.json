A majority of all voters would\r\nwelcome Government Ownership of Railroads and other public utilities. The\r\nrecent great victory in Chicago for Municipal Ownership demonstrates this\r\nfact. What Chicago has done locally can be accomplished in the nation—and\r\nWILL be done as soon as the people overcome\r\n\r\n                            Political Inertia\r\n\r\nWith many the voting habit becomes fixed after one or two elections. The\r\nordinary man keeps on “voting ’er straight” long after he has discovered\r\nthat his party’s actions are out of joint with his own views. Party\r\n“regularity” commands the average man’s support long after he KNOWS his\r\nparty is headed wrong. Some really great men, even, have placed party\r\n“regularity” before principle.\r\n\r\n                              A Great Light\r\n\r\non the correct principle of organization is to be found in that admirable\r\nwork by George Gordon Hastings,\r\n\r\n                         The First American King\r\n\r\nA dashing romance, in which a scientist and a detective of today wake up\r\nseventy-five years later to find His Majesty, Imperial and Royal, William\r\nI, Emperor of the United States and King of the Empire State of New York,\r\nruling the land, with the real power in the hands of half a dozen huge\r\ntrusts. Automobiles have been replaced by phaërmobiles; air-ships sail\r\nabove the surface of the earth; there has been a successful war against\r\nRussia; a social revolution is brewing. The book is both an enthralling\r\nromance and a serious sociological study, which scourges unmercifully the\r\nsociety and politics of the present time, many of whose brightest stars\r\nreappear in the future under thinly disguised names. There are wit and\r\nhumor and sarcasm galore—a stirring tale of adventure and a charming love\r\nstory.\r\n\r\n                       Hon. Thomas E. Watson says:\r\n\r\n“I read ‘The First American King,’ and found it one of the most\r\ninteresting books I ever opened. Mr. Hastings has not only presented a\r\nprofound study of our social and economic conditions, but he has made the\r\nstory one of fascination. It reminds me at times of Bellamy’s ‘Looking\r\nBackward,’ but the story is told with so much more human interest, the\r\nsituations themselves are so much more dramatic, that it impresses me\r\nvery much more favorably than any book of that kind I have ever known.”\r\n\r\nInteresting as the story is as a romance and as a critical sociological\r\nstudy, one of its vitally important points is\r\n\r\n                             How to Organize\r\n\r\n    =Mr. Hastings says:=\r\n\r\n“It has been suggested,” continued General Mainwarren, “that a wise\r\ncourse for patriotic leaders of your day would have been to have\r\nabandoned the hope of converting and securing the grown voters as\r\na body. It would have been best for them, at a given time, to have\r\nsaid: ‘Beginning from today, we will pay no attention to any male who\r\nis more than fifteen years of age and who is now, or within the next\r\nsix years will be, entitled to a vote. But we will direct all efforts\r\nto an entirely new body of suffragists.’ They should then have turned\r\ntheir attention to the _women of the land_, to the mothers of future\r\ngenerations of voters. It has been said that ‘Every woman is at heart a\r\nroyalist.’ It could with equal truth be said: ‘Every woman is by nature\r\na politician.’ ... Look at the influence exerted politically by various\r\nwomen of whom history speaks.”\r\n\r\n                     This Is the Key-Note of Success\r\n\r\nFor fifteen years the People’s Party, in season and out of season, has\r\npreached “Equal Rights to All, Special Privileges to None.” It has\r\npersistently demanded that government shall attend to public matters,\r\nand that private business shall be conducted by individuals with the\r\nleast possible interference—and absolutely no favoritism—by government.\r\nIt has continually demanded public ownership and government operation\r\nof railroads and other public utilities. It has urged the initiative,\r\nreferendum and the recall; a scientific money system; the abolition\r\nof monopoly in every form. Millions of voters—as the Chicago election\r\nclearly indicates—are in accord with the People’s Party; but heretofore\r\nthe voting habit, the “vote ’er straight” political insanity, has kept\r\nthem in political slavery.\r\n\r\n                            Educate the Boys\r\n\r\nLet us train up a new generation of voters—without diminishing our\r\nefforts to break up old party habits—who will have the courage of\r\nconviction and correct ideas regarding politics and economics. Let us\r\ninterest the mothers, so we can have the boys taught to cast their first\r\nvotes on the side of Justice. Habit will then keep them voting right.\r\n\r\n                            Let Us Begin Now\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings’s book is a thought-provoker. It combines romance with\r\nsociology and teaches while entertaining.

WATSON\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _Public Ownership in Chicago_\r\n\r\nSeveral weeks ago, in an interview published in the New York _World_, I\r\nexpressed the opinion that the principle of public ownership of public\r\nutilities was stronger than any political party.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe recent victory won by it in Chicago makes the truth of that statement\r\napparent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere was a city which a few months ago gave the Republican ticket the\r\nenormous majority of 60,000. So far as parties are concerned, the\r\nRepublican Party stands precisely where it stood when Roosevelt won that\r\ntriumph. So far as the Democratic Party is concerned, it has not budged\r\nan inch from the ground which it occupied when it met its Waterloo in the\r\nNovember elections. What is it, then, which gave to the candidate of the\r\nminority party a decisive success, so soon after an overwhelming defeat?\r\nEvidently, it was _the principle which he represented_.\r\n\r\nThe National Democratic Party has never declared itself in favor of\r\npublic ownership. The National Republican Party has never done so. _The\r\nPeople’s Party is the only National organization which has proclaimed and\r\nbattled for the principle which was involved in the Chicago election._\r\n\r\nSo far back as 1890 the People’s Party of the state of Georgia, and of\r\nother states, grew tired of the deceptive compromise called _Public\r\nControl_; threw it aside as a failure; boldly advanced to the more\r\nradical ground of _Public Ownership_, and formed its line of battle.\r\nIn spite of abuse, ridicule and defeat, our party has never faltered\r\nin its steady advocacy of the principle which at that time met the\r\naggressive opposition of both the Democratic and Republican Parties.\r\n_In the campaigns made by Mr. Bryan he stood for no such principle as\r\nthis._ In the campaign led by Belmont and Parker and Gorman in 1904\r\n_the Democratic Party stood for no such principle as this_; nor has the\r\nRepublican Party ever dared to proclaim itself in favor of such robust\r\nradicalism. Therefore, it is folly to say that the victory won in the\r\nChicago election is a Democratic victory. It is misleading to say that\r\nthis election illustrates the fact that “the Democratic Party always wins\r\nwhen it is Democratic.” The principle of public ownership has never been\r\na part of the political stock in trade of the Democratic Party. Therefore\r\nthe principle of public ownership of public utilities cannot be classed\r\nas Democratic, if we use the term in the partisan sense which attaches to\r\nit. _The principle of public ownership is Populistic_, and it is merely\r\nrendering to the pioneers of that movement simple justice when we say\r\nthat the Chicago election, which wiped out party lines and gave to the\r\npeople and to the principle a magnificent victory, _should redound to the\r\ncredit of those much-abused and misrepresented men who thirteen years ago\r\nunfurled that particular flag and began to fight beneath it_.\r\n\r\nThe people of Chicago evidently grew tired of being plundered; grew\r\nashamed of their own political imbecility; grew ashamed of their own\r\nmunicipal cowardice. Roused to action by a few magnetic leaders who\r\nwere not afraid and who were not to be sidetracked by hypocritical\r\ncompromises, they marshaled their strength and demonstrated how easy\r\nit is for the masses to throw off the yoke of those who plunder them\r\nunder forms of law. Nobody ever doubted for a moment that the people\r\nof Chicago, in the main, were honest, courageous, public-spirited,\r\nbut they had submitted so long to the initiative and the domination\r\nof a few organized rascals who intrenched themselves in places of\r\npower, safeguarded by legislation, that it seemed wellnigh hopeless to\r\nexpect them ever to revolt. The fact that they have revolted, and have\r\nreversed the results achieved at the November election, gives another\r\nillustration of what I said in the first issue of this magazine, namely,\r\nthat _the election of 1904_, properly construed, _was so encouraging to\r\nthe reformers as to become an inspiration_. It was pointed out that the\r\nvictory of Douglas in Massachusetts, of Folk in Missouri, of La Follette\r\nin Wisconsin, each of whom was known as a reformer, could be construed\r\nin no other way than that the people were tired of party names, of party\r\ntraditions, of party machines and party hypocrisy, and _were determined\r\nto go to the support of any man and any principle which promised them\r\nthe relief which they so much needed_. The triumph of Judge Dunne, the\r\nDemocrat, following so speedily upon the heels of an adverse vote against\r\nJudge Parker, the Democrat, absolutely clinches the truth of what I said,\r\nnamely, that _the only party, the only principle, the only sentiment\r\nwhich grew stronger by the campaign of 1904 was that of_ RADICALISM.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhy shouldn’t the lesson of the Chicago election be taken to heart by\r\nevery great city and every small town in this Republic? If the people of\r\nChicago can turn the rascals out, the people of New York can turn the\r\nrascals out, the people of Philadelphia can turn the rascals out. Talk\r\nabout vested rights and charters which grant monopolies! Nobody wants to\r\nconfiscate property or violate contracts, no matter how ill-judged those\r\ncontracts may have been. But we say this: Just as private property was\r\nassessed and taken under the principle of Eminent Domain, in order that\r\ncorporations should construct their railways, their telegraph lines,\r\ntheir telephone lines, so the same principle of Eminent Domain can be\r\napplied to return to the people what was taken away from the people.\r\nAssess these properties at a fair valuation, pay honestly and fully what\r\nthey are worth, then take them over for the public to be operated for the\r\nbenefit of the public. The law of Eminent Domain can be applied to all\r\nsorts of property, real and personal, the tangible thing called an acre\r\nof ground and the intangible thing called a charter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nConsider this Chicago election in the broad National point of view. How\r\ncan it give any encouragement to Mr. Roosevelt, who is still tinkering\r\nand pottering at the worn-out fabric of _Governmental control_? How can\r\nit give any encouragement to the Democratic Party, which has nothing in\r\nits platform which can be twisted into a declaration in favor of that\r\nthing which Chicago has just done? So far from being a vindication of the\r\nDemocratic attitude, as expressed in all of its National platforms, it\r\nis a rebuke to the timid, weak-kneed, short-sighted leaders of National\r\nDemocracy. The vindication is to those men, who, in the years gone by,\r\nproclaimed the principles, preached the gospel, scattered the literature,\r\nendured the odium, fought the battle, bore the heat and burden of the\r\nday, and are now in this late hour looking up, elated, joyful, exultant,\r\nhappy, that at last the smile of success has rested upon the earnest,\r\nuntiring efforts which have gone so long without recognition and reward.\r\n\r\nThe victor in the Chicago election was _the great Populist Principle_,\r\nPUBLIC OWNERSHIP!\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _A Bitter Attack Upon the South_\r\n\r\nEver since the close of the Civil War there has been a growing sentiment\r\non both sides of Mason and Dixon’s line in favor of mutual forbearance,\r\nthe purpose being to speed the day when the North and South shall become\r\nreconciled.\r\n\r\nIn the South no speaker will now add to his popularity or influence by\r\nreckless abuse of the North.\r\n\r\nWe had supposed that the North was equally tired of the speaker or writer\r\nwho puts the torch to sectional prejudice or who wantonly inflicts upon\r\nthe South a blow which he must realize will arouse angry resentment.\r\n\r\nWhen the last gun was fired at Appomattox, the biggest, bravest, best\r\nhearted men on each side united in the effort to stem the tide of\r\nsectional hatred and to knit together the bonds of brotherly love.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant, by his magnanimity at the surrender, set a sublime\r\nstandard.\r\n\r\nGeneral Lee, by his noble advice and example, gave the South a lesson\r\nwhose influence for good cannot be overestimated.\r\n\r\nHorace Greeley, when he volunteered to sign the bond of Jefferson\r\nDavis, and Senator L. Q. C. Lamar, of Mississippi, when he pronounced a\r\nmagnificent memorial address upon Charles Sumner in the Senate, were but\r\nfollowing the illustrious precedents of Grant and Lee.\r\n\r\nLater, there came the mission of Henry Grady and of John B. Gordon, upon\r\nthe one side, and the conciliatory words and deeds of William McKinley on\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nNor should we forget the fine tribute paid to Southern character and\r\ncourage in the writings of Theodore Roosevelt, who as President has\r\nhonored the sons of Stonewall Jackson, Jeb Stuart and General Beauregard,\r\nand who, in one of his latest appointments, has given preference to\r\nGeneral Rosser, the youngest of the Confederate brigadiers.\r\n\r\nThe battle-scarred veterans of the North have been meeting in memorable\r\nreunions the survivors of those who followed Johnston and Forrest and\r\nJackson and Lee; and the most touching and inspiring scenes have been\r\nwitnessed at these encampments where the South and the North recognized\r\neach other’s honesty, valor and generosity, and each section vied with\r\nthe other in the glorious work of harmonizing the nation.\r\n\r\nAt the grave of General Grant it was the presence of our Southern\r\nsoldier, John B. Gordon, which testified to the North the sympathy of the\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\nAnd only a few days ago President Roosevelt inquired diligently into\r\nthe circumstances of the widowed Mrs. Gordon to know whether or not an\r\nappointment as Postmaster for the city of Atlanta would be acceptable to\r\nher.\r\n\r\nDuring the Spanish war the South sprang into the ranks under the old\r\nflag, at the tap of the drum, and the blood of a Southern boy was the\r\nfirst that was shed in the conflict.\r\n\r\nIt was the ranking cavalry leader of the expiring Confederacy who\r\nsteadied the lines before Santiago, prevented a retreat, and brought from\r\nMr. Roosevelt the manly acknowledgment that to General Joseph Wheeler,\r\nmore than to any other man, was due the fact that we won the victory.\r\n\r\nIt was a Southern boy who took his life in his hands in the effort to\r\nblock the Spanish harbor, and worthily earned the title of “The Hero of\r\nthe _Merrimac_.”\r\n\r\nIt is sad to think that all this patriotism may not have made a deep\r\nimpression upon the country.\r\n\r\nIt is sad to realize that the work of such men as Alexander H. Stephens,\r\nBenjamin H. Hill, Senator Lamar, Thomas Nelson Page and Henry W. Grady\r\nhas left so much still to be done before that man, North or South, who\r\nendeavors to inflame the passions of the sections shall be made to\r\nfeel that he has excited for himself the contempt and disgust which he\r\ndeserves.\r\n\r\nIn a recent issue of the New York _Independent_ comes Albert Bushnell\r\nHart, Professor of History at Harvard University, distilling as much\r\nbitterness and gall as ever fell from the lips of John J. Ingalls or\r\nThaddeus Stevens.\r\n\r\nHe writes an article called “Conditions of the Southern Problem,” and\r\na more thoroughly exaggerated and libelous contribution to public\r\ndiscussion has not been made during the last twenty years.\r\n\r\nThe average reader will get some idea of the value of Mr. Hart’s\r\nconclusions when he comes upon the sober statement that “white\r\nmountaineers (of the South) have been known _to take their children out\r\nof school because the teacher would insist that the world is round_.”\r\n\r\nWho stuffed Dr. Hart with that old joke?\r\n\r\nWhat credit does he do to himself when he shows to the world that he\r\naccepts such worn-out jests as facts?\r\n\r\nDoes he not know that there are plenty of wags all over the world—even in\r\nPullman cars—who take a delight in playing upon the credulous?\r\n\r\nHe will meet men who will tell him that in certain backwoods communities\r\n“the people don’t know that the war is over,” or he will be told that in\r\nsome mountain counties “they are still voting for Andrew Jackson.”\r\n\r\nBut would Professor Hart take such statements for anything but jokes?\r\n\r\nDoesn’t he know that the jest about the rural belief that the world is\r\nflat instead of round belongs to the same gray-haired family?\r\n\r\nEven a professor of history should learn that there is just as great a\r\ndifference between jokes and facts as there is between facts and jokes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nProfessor Hart says that “in a few communities, notably South Carolina,\r\nthe poor whites have unaccountably discovered that if they will always\r\nvote together they always have a majority, and they keep a man of their\r\nown type in the United States Senate. In most other states, however,\r\npolitics is directed by intelligent and honorable men.”\r\n\r\nIsn’t this a rippingly reckless arraignment of the entire state of South\r\nCarolina? Does the Professor of History at Harvard mean to say that\r\nthe politics of South Carolina is directed by men less intelligent and\r\nhonorable than those of “_most other states_”?\r\n\r\nIf so, upon what ground does he base the accusation?\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the poor whites do not control South Carolina. It is\r\n_the middle class_ whites who control South Carolina, and who elected Ben\r\nTillman to the United States Senate.\r\n\r\nOf course, Professor Hart intended to give Senator Tillman a side-wipe of\r\nspecial vigor, and he did it, striking the whole state at the same time\r\nhe struck Tillman. But to what extent was the blow deserved? Ben Tillman\r\nmay, or may not, be an ideal Senator. He may, or may not, be an ideal\r\nleader. Opinions differ about that, even in South Carolina.\r\n\r\nBut why should a Northern writer select a Southern senator and a Southern\r\nstate to be held up in this insulting manner to public odium? In what\r\nrespect does Tillman’s record in the Senate, for honesty and ability,\r\ncompare unfavorably with that of Quay of Pennsylvania, Platt of New\r\nYork, Aldrich of Rhode Island, or Gorman of Maryland? Each one of those\r\nsenators has been basely subservient to thievish corporations, and has\r\nhelped them to fatten on national legislation at the expense of the great\r\nbody of the people.\r\n\r\nCan Dr. Hart say that of Ben Tillman? I defy him to do it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. Hart asks, “Why should the negro expect protection _when the white\r\nman is powerless against any personal white enemy who chooses to shoot\r\nhim down in the street_, when not one white murderer in a hundred is\r\npunished for his crime?”\r\n\r\nDr. Albert Bushnell Hart is evidently thinking about the case of James\r\nTillman, of South Carolina, who shot down in the street Editor Gonzales,\r\nand who was acquitted, on his trial.\r\n\r\nBy all sane persons it is admitted to be utterly unfair to judge the\r\nentire South, or North, by any one case, or by any one crime.\r\n\r\nIt is useless to argue the guilt or innocence of James Tillman; but we\r\nall know that human nature is prejudiced by political feeling; and none\r\nwill deny that the feud between Tillman and Gonzales was a political\r\nfeud. The killing was a political killing. In a case like that the action\r\nof court and jury will be influenced by political feeling, whether the\r\nresult be right or wrong.\r\n\r\nHas Albert Bushnell Hart never heard of a political feud in any other\r\npart of the world than the South, and has he never known political\r\nfeeling to protect one who was prosecuted for a crime? Has he never known\r\nof instances in Northern cities where prisoners at the Bar apparently\r\nowed their salvation to _secret societies_ of any sort—or _to political\r\npull_ of any sort?\r\n\r\nIt has not been so very long since Edward S. Stokes met James Fisk on the\r\nstaircase, in the Grand Central Hotel, in New York City, _and shot him\r\ndown_.\r\n\r\nOne might think this amounted to about the same thing as the shooting\r\ndown of a personal enemy on the street.\r\n\r\nFisk died, as Gonzales died. Stokes was tried, as Tillman was tried.\r\nStokes was not hanged in New York any more than Tillman was hanged in\r\nSouth Carolina.\r\n\r\nWill Dr. Hart please furnish an explanation which will not fit the South\r\nCarolina case as snugly as it fits the New York case?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nProfessor Hart asks, “Why should the Northern people believe that the\r\nSouth means well by the negro when such a man as Governor Vardaman, of\r\nMississippi, brutally threatens him and his white friends in the North?”\r\n\r\n_When and where has Governor James K. Vardaman “brutally threatened the\r\nnegro and his Northern friends”?_\r\n\r\nGovernor Vardaman, not many days ago, _risked his political life_, to\r\nsay nothing of personal danger, _to protect a negro from a white mob_.\r\nPerhaps every white man in the mob had voted for Vardaman, and was his\r\npersonal and political friend; yet, although it was generally believed\r\nthat the negro was guilty of a heinous offense, this Governor, who has\r\nbeen singled out for abuse, did not hesitate one moment to jeopardize his\r\nwhole political future by throwing around the hunted negro the official\r\nprotection of the law.\r\n\r\nNo matter how much Governor Vardaman may be mistaken in some of his\r\nviews, and some of his utterances, no man ought now to deny that he\r\npossesses personal and political courage, or that his respect for law is\r\nof that high character which proclaims, “_The color of a man’s skin shall\r\nnot be the measure of his legal rights_.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Dr. Hart says, “in one respect the poor whites are terrible\r\nteachers to the negroes; they are an ungovernable people and _do not\r\nallow themselves to be punished for such peccadillos as murder_.”\r\n\r\nO Mr. Professor of History at Harvard! has your blind passion against\r\nthe South lost you to all sense of proportion in the making of public\r\nstatements?\r\n\r\nIf the poor whites of the South “do not allow themselves to be punished\r\nfor such little things as murder,” why do they go to the penitentiary at\r\nall?\r\n\r\nYou will find a sufficient number of poor whites in the penitentiaries of\r\nthe South—are they there just for the fun of it?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the negro, Dr. Hart again says, “he may not murder or\r\nassault, or even speak saucily to a white person, on most dreadful\r\npenalties. Partly for self-protection, still more from a feeling of race\r\nsupremacy, it is made a kind of _lèse-majesté_ for a negro to lay hands\r\non a white man; even to defend his family or his own life, the serpent\r\nmust not bite the heel of the chosen people.”\r\n\r\nWhat utter disregard of facts!\r\n\r\nLet me cite a few cases which come within my personal knowledge.\r\n\r\nIn McIntosh County, Georgia, one of the most prominent white planters\r\nwas deputized by the sheriff to arrest a negro who had been engaged in a\r\nriot. The white man authorized to arrest the negro went to his house and\r\ncalled for him at night. The negro refused to come out. The deputy forced\r\nhis way in, and the negro shot him dead. There were three negroes in the\r\nhouse, all participating in resisting the officer.\r\n\r\nThe white man’s court acquitted _two_ of the negroes, and sent _one_ up\r\nfor ten years.\r\n\r\nIn the penitentiary of Georgia, at this time, are some white men serving\r\nout their terms at hard labor for an outrage committed on a negro man in\r\none of the country counties near Atlanta.\r\n\r\nA white man, by the name of Alec Harvill, belonging to the class of poor\r\nwhites, was tried for murder in one of the Piedmont counties for which\r\nMr. Hart has such a contempt, and was convicted.\r\n\r\nHe is now serving a term in the penitentiary, as he has been doing for\r\nthe last five or six years.\r\n\r\nHow was he convicted? _Upon the testimony of a single negro witness._\r\nNobody saw the alleged crime, or pretended to have seen it, except this\r\nnegro boy.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the white judge and the white jury believed the negro in\r\npreference to the father or mother of the accused.\r\n\r\nIn another of the Piedmont counties of Georgia a white man outraged a\r\nnegro woman.\r\n\r\nWithin the last ninety days that criminal has been tried by a white judge\r\nand jury—the prosecution being pushed by the state of Georgia through her\r\nAttorney-General.\r\n\r\nThe lower court convicted the criminal, the Supreme Court has affirmed\r\nthe finding, and the white man will have to meet the penalty of the law\r\nfor his violation of a negro woman.\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago a white man named Robinson, living in Waynesboro, Ga.,\r\nkilled a negro.\r\n\r\nThe white man had cursed a negro woman, who had “put in her mouth” while\r\nhe was holding a conversation with a negro man.\r\n\r\nWhen Robinson cursed the woman the deceased threw off his coat and rushed\r\nat Robinson, exclaiming, “I won’t stand that!”\r\n\r\nRobinson backed, saying, “Don’t come on me! Stand back!”\r\n\r\nThe negro continued to advance; Robinson drew his pistol and shot his\r\nassailant.\r\n\r\nRobinson was tried, convicted and sent to the penitentiary.\r\n\r\nIn Wilkes County, Ga., a convict boss whipped a negro convict who sulked\r\nand wouldn’t work. The negro had a bad character, and was serving\r\nsentence for a grave offense.\r\n\r\nThe whipping may possibly have caused the negro’s death, though there was\r\nmuch testimony to the effect that he died from natural causes.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, a white judge and jury convicted the boss who inflicted the\r\nwhipping, and he had to serve his time in the penitentiary. Robert Cannon\r\nwas his name.\r\n\r\nIn another instance I myself furnished the evidence of maltreatment of\r\na negro convict in the Georgia penitentiary, and, the facts being made\r\nknown to the Governor of Georgia, a fine of $2,500 was imposed on the\r\nConvict Lessee Company.\r\n\r\nThe Governor was General John B. Gordon.\r\n\r\nThe name of the negro convict was Bill Sturgis.\r\n\r\nExamples like these could be multiplied indefinitely from Georgia and\r\nevery Southern state.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother astonishing fact is related by Dr. Albert Bushnell Hart.\r\n\r\n“The most intelligent white people admit the fact that they are _trying\r\nto keep the negro down_ because otherwise _the lowest white men will\r\nmarry negro women_.”\r\n\r\nNow, where on earth did Dr. Hart get _that_?\r\n\r\nDoes not Dr. Hart know that the antipathy between the negro and the poor\r\nwhite is, and always has been, greater than the antipathy between the\r\nnegro and the property-owning white?\r\n\r\nDoes not Dr. Hart himself, in another part of his article, express the\r\nbelief that a dangerous antagonism exists between _the poor whites_ and\r\nthe negro?\r\n\r\nDoes Professor Hart believe that the true reason why the Southern people\r\nwish _to maintain white supremacy_ is to keep poor _whites from marrying\r\nnegro women_? Does he not realize that he makes himself a laughing-stock\r\nwhen he gives his name to a statement of that kind? _No white man, rich\r\nor poor, wants a negro woman_ FOR A WIFE!\r\n\r\nDr. Hart may put that down as a proposition which is absolutely true.\r\n\r\nThere are many white men, unfortunately, who establish relations of\r\n_concubinage_ with negro women, and this crime is frequently punished in\r\nthe Southern courts; but where is the evidence that white men wish to\r\ntake negro wives?\r\n\r\nIf that inclination is so strong, so ungovernable as to become the motive\r\nof the South in maintaining white supremacy, _it should be capable of\r\nproof_. Now, where is the proof? _Produce it, Dr. Hart!_\r\n\r\nThe simple truth of the matter is that Dr. Albert Bushnell Hart has\r\nallowed himself to be stuffed with a whole lot of nonsense upon a subject\r\nwhich he does not understand.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNow for a parting quotation from this precious article of Harvard’s\r\nprofessional historian:\r\n\r\n“Good people (in the South) rarely make much distinction between the man\r\nwho is guilty and the man who looks like a criminal; between shooting\r\nhim down in the street or burning him at the stake; between burning\r\nthe guilty man or his innocent wife; between the quiet family inferno\r\nwith only two or three hundred spectators and a first-class, advertised\r\n_auto-da-fé_ with special trains, and the children of the public schools\r\nin the foreground.”\r\n\r\nThere you have it, in all its true amplitude and _animus_!\r\n\r\n“The _good people_” of the South do not strive, according to Dr. Hart, to\r\ndraw the line of distinction between the man who is guilty and the man\r\nwho simply _looks_ guilty. They establish no real distinction between\r\nthe guilty man and his innocent wife. It makes no difference to these\r\n“good people” whether they have a quiet family inferno, with two or three\r\nhundred spectators, or the first-class, advertised burning, when special\r\ntrains are run and the public-school teachers give the children a recess\r\nin order that they may attend the exhibition!\r\n\r\nIf that is not mere partisanship, frothing at the mouth, what is it?\r\n\r\nIt certainly cannot be seriously taken as a truthful summing up of a\r\ngeneral situation.\r\n\r\nAn irresponsible stump-speaker, in the reckless rush of a hot political\r\ncampaign, would have better sense than to deal in hyperbole in that\r\nfurious fashion.\r\n\r\nBut when a man of Dr. Hart’s standing publishes stuff like this it does\r\nharm. It misleads the North and arouses passionate indignation in the\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Hart does work of that wild sort he is no longer a historian; he\r\nis simply an incendiary. He is a child _playing with fire_.\r\n\r\nIf I were to apply to the North the same measure which Professor Hart\r\nhas applied to the South, could I not convict the “good people” of _his_\r\nsection, as he has convicted “the good people” of _mine_?\r\n\r\nAre “the good people” of the entire North to be held up as utterly\r\nlawless, making a jest of “_such peccadillos as murder_,” because of the\r\nlate doings at Wilmington, Del., or at Springfield, O.?\r\n\r\nHas Indiana had no lynchings; has Colorado had no carnival of crime?\r\n\r\nJames Tillman, of South Carolina, “shot down in the street” a mortal\r\npolitical foe who had, beyond all question, given him great provocation.\r\n\r\nI do not say that James Tillman was justified in his act—I merely say\r\nthat he had provocation, great provocation.\r\n\r\nHe was acquitted, _but he was not sent to Congress_.\r\n\r\nHe left the court-room a broken, chastened man; and is now leading a life\r\nof sobriety, industry and rectitude.\r\n\r\nNot many years ago, _on a Sunday morning_, a saloon-keeper and his son,\r\nin the city of Boston, Mass., beat down a drunken man who had broken a\r\nwindow-pane of said saloon—_beat him down on the streets, and kicked him\r\nto death after he was down_.\r\n\r\nApparently the man’s sole offense was that he had broken a pane of glass\r\nand refused to pay for it.\r\n\r\nThe saloon was open in violation of law.\r\n\r\nThe glass was broken by a man too drunk to know what he was doing.\r\n\r\nAnd the two men of Boston fell upon the helpless, drunken wretch, _and\r\nkicked him to death in the streets_.\r\n\r\nWas Massachusetts and all the North condemned for _that_?\r\n\r\nWhat became of the homicides?\r\n\r\nOne received a nominal punishment, which was not a real punishment; and\r\nthe other boasts that he was never punished at all.\r\n\r\nWhere was the boast made?\r\n\r\nIn the House of Representatives of the United States—_for Boston, Mass.,\r\nactually sent to Congress the man who had helped to kick another man to\r\ndeath in the streets_!\r\n\r\nHis name? John A. Sullivan. I beg pardon—it is,\r\n\r\n                    _The Honorable John A. Sullivan._\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina is far behind Massachusetts—_she has not yet sent James\r\nTillman to Congress_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the name of the Good God who made us all—are we _never_ to hear the\r\nlast of these bitter revilings of the South?\r\n\r\nAre we _never_ to reach the Era of Good Feeling for which so many strong\r\nmen have toiled, so many pure women have prayed?\r\n\r\nWill the blind Apostles of Hate _never_ “Let us have Peace”?\r\n\r\nShall the marplot and the bigot and the partisan and the Pharisee\r\n_forever_ be able to thwart the nobler efforts of nobler men?\r\n\r\nShall Ransy Sniffle _always_ succeed in embroiling those who want to be\r\nfriends?\r\n\r\nWhen I think of Abraham Lincoln—magnanimous, broad, far-seeing, praising\r\nthe Confederates who had stormed the heights at Gettysburg, calling upon\r\nthe band to play “Dixie” on the night following Lee’s surrender—and then\r\ncontemplate this narrow, spiteful, out-of-date Professor of History at\r\nHarvard, I realize more than ever how much the South lost when a madman\r\nassassinated the statesman _who had her blood in his veins, sympathy for\r\nher in his heart, and a knowledge of her in his mind_.\r\n\r\nIn vain will Congress return the battle-flags of the Lost Cause, in vain\r\nwill the McKinleys and the Roosevelts labor for the Era of Good Feeling,\r\nif the violent partisans of the North, playing into the hands of the\r\nalmost obsolete fire-eaters of the South, give to sectional hatreds a new\r\nlease of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _Remember the Rascals_\r\n\r\nThe law provides that a Congressman shall be paid a salary of $5,000\r\nper year; and in order that the compensation shall be _equal_, among\r\nmembers, the Government pays their traveling expenses. Otherwise the\r\nRepresentative who comes from the Pacific coast to the Capital, paying\r\nhis way, would realize very much less on his salary than a Representative\r\nfrom Maryland or Virginia.\r\n\r\nThe cost of travel was greater in the olden days than now, and the\r\nfree pass had not then become one of the devil’s favorite inventions.\r\nConsequently, the lawmakers declared that the taxpayers should furnish\r\n_twenty cents per mile_ to meet the expenses of the Representative in\r\ngoing from his home to the post of duty.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as every member of Congress—occasional cranks excepted—now rides\r\non the free passes, the mileage has become a considerable addition to the\r\nsalary.\r\n\r\nA member who lives west of the Mississippi will find his pay increased a\r\nsixth, or a fifth, according to the distance from the Atlantic seaboard;\r\nwhile the delegate who comes from Hawaii will pocket considerably more\r\nthan $2,000 for the alleged cost of getting to Washington.\r\n\r\nSo far, good. Everybody knows that Congressmen do _not_ pay their way,\r\nand everybody knows that mileage no longer has any honest foundation; but\r\nwe’ve got used to the grab, and we let it go, as inevitable, with a weary\r\nsigh of hopeless disgust.\r\n\r\nBut the Congress which recently adjourned broke all previous records and\r\ngave the country a new chapter in the record of brazen dishonor.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the meeting of the regular session there had been an extra\r\nsession. This held on till the regular session began. There was no\r\ninterval between the two. So far as time was concerned, the one ran into\r\nthe other. Hence, no member went home from the extra session and came\r\nback to the regular session.\r\n\r\nThere was absolutely no “recess” at all—_not a minute_ between the one\r\nsession and the other.\r\n\r\nNow, behold the evil influence of a bad example.\r\n\r\nThe President got the idea that while there was no _actual_ recess\r\nbetween the two sessions of Congress, there was a “_constructive_” recess.\r\n\r\nThe Mephistopheles who whispered this baleful advice in the ear of Mr.\r\nRoosevelt was a better friend to the appointees who were to benefit\r\nby it—General Wood and Dr. Crum, for example—than they were to the\r\nPresident. The members of Congress were not slow to reason the case to\r\nthis effect:\r\n\r\nIf there has been such a _recess_ as to give General Wood a promotion in\r\nthe army, and to Dr. Crum a fat office in the revenue service, then it\r\nhas been a recess _for all purposes_.\r\n\r\n“If the President can fill offices upon a supposed recess, we can fill\r\nour pocket with mileage upon the same supposition.\r\n\r\n“The whole thing being imaginary, that theory which puts Wood higher\r\nup on the pay-roll, and which puts a negro in the Custom House at\r\nCharleston, will also imagine that we went home during the supposed\r\nrecess, and that we have just returned from Georgia, Alabama, Wisconsin,\r\nCalifornia and the state of Washington. It’s a poor rule that won’t work\r\nboth ways.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe law clothes the President with the power to make recess\r\nappointments—which rids him of the necessity of consulting the Senate.\r\nIn this instance, he created a recess in his mind, when none existed in\r\nfact, and the result was good for Wood and Crum.\r\n\r\nThe imaginary recess having been created by the President, the members of\r\nthe Lower House took an imaginary trip home during the imaginary recess,\r\nand then proposed that they be paid their imaginary expenses, not in\r\nimaginary money, but in hard cash.\r\n\r\nTherefore, sixty-odd Republicans and forty-odd Democrats, _and two Union\r\nLabor men_, voted to give themselves $190,000 of the people’s money to\r\npay for _imaginary journeys made during an imaginary recess_.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful if a more shameless attempt to steal from the public\r\ntreasury has ever been attempted.\r\n\r\nThe Senate killed the measure, not because the Senate itself is so\r\npure and honest—for it isn’t—but because it could safely rebuke the\r\nHouse—which it despises—and pose as Watch-dog of the Treasury, without\r\nloss to itself.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe people are entitled to know the names of the rascals who tried to\r\nsteal $190,000 of their money.\r\n\r\nTennessee will not be shocked to know that “Slippery Jim” Richardson\r\nvoted for the grab.\r\n\r\nShe may be shocked to know that Brownlow did the same thing—Brownlow, the\r\nson of the famous Parson.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina may be astonished to learn that on the roll of dishonor\r\nare the names of Aiken and Legare.\r\n\r\nVirginia will see that she has been misrepresented by the vote of\r\nMaynard.\r\n\r\nLouisiana will find three of her votes on the shameful list—Pujo and\r\nBroussard and Davey.\r\n\r\nThe Democracy of Missouri may feel indignant at the vote of Hunt, and\r\nMississippi at that of Hill.\r\n\r\nAs the list of names is printed elsewhere, it is not necessary to\r\nparticularize further; but I note one thing with special interest.\r\n\r\nThe Massachusetts Congressman who was selected by the enemies of W. R.\r\nHearst to attack him on the floor of the House gave the country a chance\r\nto learn who was the cleaner, better man.\r\n\r\n_Hearst did not vote for the steal; Sullivan, of Massachusetts, did!_\r\n\r\nThe people of Georgia may wish to know where Congressman Bartlett was\r\nwhen the vote was being taken. His name is not recorded against the\r\nsteal. Nor is that of Brantley or that of Adamson.\r\n\r\n_Where were they?_\r\n\r\nThese three gentlemen are paid $15,000 per year to stay in their places\r\nand safeguard the rights of the people who elected them.\r\n\r\nWhere were these three Georgians when this piece of rascality was being\r\nput through the House? If they were necessarily absent why did they not\r\narrange “pairs,” and thus give their votes to defeat the robbers? _Did\r\nthey_ DODGE?\r\n\r\nIf so, _Why?_\r\n\r\nAlabama will want to know where Bankhead and Wiley were; Texas will ask\r\nexplanations of Stephens; Tennessee of Sims; Kentucky of Hopkins and\r\nStanley.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEvery man who voted for the mileage grab, or who dodged the vote, _should\r\nbe marked for political punishment by the constituency which he betrayed_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  _Introductory to a Letter from a Boy_\r\n\r\nAs a rule, I do not help schoolboys in writing their speeches or in\r\npreparing for debates. In fact, I make it a rule _not_ to do so.\r\n\r\nIt is best for the boy to dig his own bait. The sooner he learns to rely\r\nupon himself, the better. In that way only will he become _strong_.\r\n\r\nBut sometimes I break my own rules—for the sake of variety, perhaps—and I\r\ndid it not long ago when a certain college in Georgia took as a subject\r\nfor debate the proposition:\r\n\r\n“_Resolved_, That the South should have supported Watson in the last\r\nPresidential election.”\r\n\r\nOf course, there were but two names to be considered in the\r\ndiscussion—Watson and Parker.\r\n\r\nTeddy wasn’t in it at all. And that is a queer thing, too, for about\r\none-third of the white people of Georgia believe just as Teddy does\r\nabout the money question, the Tariff system, the Panama business, the\r\nPhilippine policy, the big navy project, the Railroad rate reduction, and\r\nso forth and so on.\r\n\r\nBut they wouldn’t vote for Teddy to save his life.\r\n\r\nAnd why?\r\n\r\nThey have a distinct presentiment that if they should vote for a man like\r\nRoosevelt they would never dare to go to sleep again lest they wake up\r\nnext morning and find niggers sitting at the breakfast-table on the level\r\nof social equality.\r\n\r\nConsequently, Roosevelt didn’t cut any ice in the schoolhouse debate.\r\n\r\nParker and I—we had it all to ourselves. Good-natured people will not\r\nbegrudge this honor to Parker and me, I am sure, for we are clearly\r\nentitled to something, and Teddy has just about carried off everything\r\nelse. He can afford to be generous, and to let two of his late\r\ncompetitors wear the laurels in a college debate away down in Georgia.\r\n\r\nWhether Parker coached the boys on his side I am not informed.\r\n\r\nIf he didn’t, they must have had a tough job getting up “points.” It is a\r\ntask at which the average boy would need prompt and patient assistance.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, W. J. B. was appealed to. At all events, he should have been.\r\nThe Nebraska Talk-Factory turns out quite a variety of finished product,\r\nand the kind of garment it wove for the adornment of Parker, late in the\r\nlast campaign, was a marvel in its way—especially when one considers how\r\nsuddenly the machinery had to be readjusted to fill that particular order.\r\n\r\nAs to myself, I frankly confess that I “suspended the rules” and gave my\r\nchampion some “points.” This was wrong, but human.\r\n\r\nHad I known that the judges presiding over the debate were two Democrats\r\nand a Republican, I would have furnished points to the Parker side, also.\r\nThen my champions would have come out ahead.\r\n\r\nMy private opinion is that I could have coached the Parker champions\r\nin such a way that even a pied-piper tribunal, composed of two Georgia\r\nDemocrats and a New York Republican, would have had to call in a fourth\r\nman to know how to decide.\r\n\r\nProvided, _always_, that W. J. B. had stayed out of it.\r\n\r\nOf course, when _he_ butts in, nobody can say what may happen.\r\n\r\nWell, the boys debated, the judges decided, and Parker won out.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the story is related by the ingenuous youth who fought\r\nfor me in that contest, and I am going to give you his letter just as he\r\nwrote it.\r\n\r\n                               THE LETTER\r\n\r\n                                     MANASSAS, GA., March 13, 1905.\r\n\r\n      _Hon. T. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga._\r\n\r\n        MY DEAR SIR: On the fourth of January you were so kind as\r\n      to send me a few very strong points for my speech. About\r\n      the same time Hon. Jas. K. Hines also sent me some points.\r\n\r\n        Our debate was postponed until the tenth inst. For I was\r\n      sure we would need ample time to prepare for such a fight\r\n      as we would have to make.\r\n\r\n        In my letter to you I mentioned the opposition which I\r\n      thought we would have to encounter, and the amount of\r\n      interest that would be manifested in such a subject.\r\n\r\n        In this I was not disappointed or mistaken.\r\n\r\n        The badges were eagerly sought all day previous to the\r\n      debate, and the Watson badges were worn by quite a number.\r\n\r\n        The Auditorium was filled with people. The rostrum was\r\n      covered with an arch, coming from either side of the stage,\r\n      made of ribbon.\r\n\r\n        Half of the arch was made of the Watson colors, and half of\r\n      the Parker colors.\r\n\r\n        As I entered town that afternoon I heard a little boy cry,\r\n      “Hurrah for Tom Watson!” This alone paid me for the effort\r\n      and work on the debate.\r\n\r\n        To secure impartial judges was the one thing dreaded from\r\n      the start, and in this we made a miserable failure.\r\n\r\n        Two Democrats and a Republican were the best we could do.\r\n      Or at least the third man came from New York.\r\n\r\n        My colleague opened with a strong speech. Before the first\r\n      on the negative side finished, all my fear had vanished,\r\n      and I was really anxious to have my say.\r\n\r\n        The chairman reprimanded some little boys for bumping their\r\n      heads, a few moments before I began. I opened by saying\r\n      that I wanted one of those little boys to bump his head as\r\n      much as he liked because I heard him cry, “Hurrah for Tom\r\n      Watson!” Turning to the audience, I asked all the little\r\n      girls to remember that little boy at the proper time. Then\r\n      I carried the little fellow step by step from the Claxton\r\n      Institute to the President’s chair on the People’s Party\r\n      Platform.\r\n\r\n        Our speeches over, the committee retired for consultation.\r\n\r\n        Our opponents looked the worst whipped of any I ever saw.\r\n\r\n        The audience began to call for Watson badges to take the\r\n      place of their Parker ones.\r\n\r\n        It is generally very much out of place for anyone to accuse\r\n      a committee of a wrong decision on purpose, but the case\r\n      was so plain that I do not hesitate to say that their\r\n      decision was based on the condition of their hearts before\r\n      they heard our speeches.\r\n\r\n        But many were on our side. One of the Emory College boys,\r\n      a very prominent physician and a strong Democrat, and\r\n      brother-in-law to one of the committee, was outspoken in\r\n      saying that the affirmative side won.\r\n\r\n        I never cared for the decision being given against me so\r\n      little as I did this time, for everyone, almost, in the\r\n      audience knew the right.\r\n\r\n        Our debate no doubt resulted in waking up the people to\r\n      some degree, for our opponents could only eulogize you.\r\n\r\n        Ever rest assured of my highest appreciation of the points\r\n      sent me.\r\n\r\n        Wishing that you may live long to continue your fight for\r\n      the many against the few, I am,\r\n\r\n                      Very respectfully yours,\r\n\r\n                                                      S. B. MCCALL.\r\n\r\nA missive like the foregoing is decidedly interesting to me, and the\r\nspirit moves me to say certain things to my correspondent, which I do, in\r\nmanner and form following, to wit:\r\n\r\n                            A LETTER TO A BOY\r\n\r\n        MY DEAR YOUNG FRIEND: I do not know you personally, have\r\n      never grasped your hand and looked into your eyes, but your\r\n      letter makes me think well of you.\r\n\r\n        In the first place, it discloses the fact that after all\r\n      your careful preparation for the debate, _you made an\r\n      extemporaneous speech_. Good. No one can be a debater on\r\n      any other terms. It is possible that one may be an orator\r\n      and be unable to leave the written form, but the gift of\r\n      extemporaneous expression _is absolutely essential to a\r\n      debater_.\r\n\r\n        _To think on one’s legs_—that’s a gift; and it seems that\r\n      you have it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n        Again, I learn from your letter that you _knew_ you had on\r\n      your hands a hard task in maintaining the unpopular side of\r\n      the debate, and that you did not shrink from the burden.\r\n      Good again. That’s the way to become a _man_. The boy who\r\n      is ever on the lookout for the easy job, the popular side,\r\n      and who runs away from obstacles or opposition, will always\r\n      remain a boy—and not much of a boy at that.\r\n\r\n        There is but one rule for you if you want to be a\r\n      man—absolutely but one—and that is to do your level best\r\n      to reach a clear, correct idea of what is right, and then\r\n      stick to it and fight for it, in spite of the “world, the\r\n      flesh and the devil.”\r\n\r\n        This rule will make you enemies, and will give you just\r\n      about as many hard knocks as are needful to your health,\r\n      but if you want to be a _man_, that’s the price you’ve got\r\n      to pay.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n        You say you found difficulty in securing impartial judges.\r\n\r\n        Well, I should think so.\r\n\r\n        The “impartial judge” is one of those pleasing fancies with\r\n      which we amuse ourselves, for the reason that we can’t help\r\n      it. We have got to get decisions some way or other, and we\r\n      don’t quite like the idea of settling grave questions by\r\n      spitting at a mark, or of guessing whether it is heads or\r\n      tails in the tossing of a coin—therefore, we resort to “the\r\n      impartial judge.”\r\n\r\n        It is one of the jokes of Christian civilization which\r\n      nobody laughs at because we have agreed that it is not a\r\n      joke.\r\n\r\n        Just between me and you, the “impartial judge” is brother\r\n      to the “non-partisan editor,” and twin-brother to the\r\n      “disinterested office-seeker.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n        You say that it is generally wrong to criticize the conduct\r\n      of those who make decisions.\r\n\r\n        You are mistaken about that. It is generally the proper\r\n      thing to do. And it is often the _only_ thing you can do.\r\n      True, it is not as much satisfaction as we are entitled to,\r\n      but it’s something.\r\n\r\n        What would baseball be, if we couldn’t cuss the umpire?\r\n\r\n        How could lawyers who lost their cases blow off the\r\n      indignation, if they couldn’t cuss the judge?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n        You state that you were not cast down by the decision which\r\n      went against you. Right. Why should you be?\r\n\r\n        Whatever was _true_, previous to the decision, was _true_\r\n      afterward.\r\n\r\n        And there’s where our political leaders fall down.\r\n\r\n        They go about the country telling the people that a certain\r\n      candidate for office is “unfit for the nomination,” and\r\n      after he is nominated the same politicians claim that the\r\n      _nomination_ makes him fit.\r\n\r\n        How can a _nomination_ make a bad man good?\r\n\r\n        That’s a deferred question which W. J. B. will answer some\r\n      day or other, and you will then see it done to the queen’s\r\n      taste.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n        Evidently you are not discouraged by the fact that you\r\n      went up against a tribunal which wouldn’t yield to reason,\r\n      eloquence, fact or fancy—a tribunal which had made up its\r\n      mind before its members heard your speech. Right again.\r\n      It’s your _duty_ to furnish the convincing argument; it is\r\n      _not in your power_ to supply judges with minds open to\r\n      conviction.\r\n\r\n        Bigger men than you have run up against immovable obstacles\r\n      of that kind.\r\n\r\n        Consider W. J. B., for instance. He found, in New England,\r\n      a lot of tribunals, the low, the high and the middle, which\r\n      were not to be convinced that he, W. J. B., was entitled to\r\n      $50,000 that old Mr. Bennett _thought_ he was leaving to\r\n      our Nebraska friend by will.\r\n\r\n        You and I would think that as the money belonged to\r\n      Bennett, and Bennett had declared in writing that W. J. B.\r\n      should have it, the judges would not interfere.\r\n\r\n        But they _did_. No amount of eloquence, of the best W. J.\r\n      B. sort, could budge them an inch. Our Nebraska friend got\r\n      knocked out all along the line.\r\n\r\n        Did it cast him down?\r\n\r\n        Not in the least. He is as cheerful—not to say saucy—as you\r\n      are over _your_ little tumble. That is just the way to be:\r\n      but one should always try to get some _lesson_ out of one’s\r\n      defeats, so that one will know better how to do next time.\r\n\r\n        If you should ask W. J. B. what lesson he has learned from\r\n      that series of knockdowns in the New England courts, he\r\n      would answer: “The next time a benevolent Yankee comes\r\n      to my house, and offers to make me a bequest of $50,000,\r\n      I will take him out and introduce him to a safe and sane\r\n      lawyer who knows how to draw a will.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n        Cultivate what is _best_ in your character and mind.\r\n\r\n        Do not _imitate_ anybody.\r\n\r\n        Study good models for the purpose of making the best\r\n      possible man out of _yourself_.\r\n\r\n        Develop your _pride_—not your vanity, conceit or egotism.\r\n\r\n        Be too proud to stoop to anything mean.\r\n\r\n        Associate with the _best_ people. If among your companions\r\n      there are those whose talk or conduct is vile, weed them\r\n      out from your life.\r\n\r\n        I feel deeply on this point, and I repeat, WEED THEM OUT.\r\n\r\n        Cultivate the honesty which makes a man what he _appears_\r\n      to be.\r\n\r\n        Don’t be a sham.\r\n\r\n        Be a reality—as earnest, powerful and fearless as is\r\n      possible to your nature.\r\n\r\n        When defeat knocks you down, don’t lie there. As soon as\r\n      you get your breath back, rise, brush the dust off, and go\r\n      up against the enemy again.\r\n\r\n        Reach a clear conception of what you want to do, and _can_\r\n      do; be sure that this is something noble in itself—then\r\n      hammer away with all your might, _and keep hammering_.\r\n\r\n        Remember that modesty is almost as becoming to a man as to\r\n      a woman, but that _humility_ has no place in man’s relation\r\n      to man.\r\n\r\n        If you are not as good as any other man, it’s your fault.\r\n\r\n        The world, and all its rewards, are as much yours as\r\n      anybody’s.\r\n\r\n        But remember this also: the race _is_ to the swift, and the\r\n      battle _is_ to the strong, USUALLY.\r\n\r\n        If you would win the race, _be swift_; if the battle, _be\r\n      strong_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _An Educational Department_\r\n\r\nThere are thousands of boys and girls, some in schools and colleges, some\r\nnot, who are anxious to learn, to develop themselves and to RISE.\r\n\r\nMany, many things they yearn to know which the class-room teachers do not\r\nteach.\r\n\r\nMany a subject they are eager to study, if somebody will but show the way.\r\n\r\nOften there are speeches to be made, essays to be written, debates to be\r\nprepared, and the boys and girls simply do not know how to start about it.\r\n\r\nFor instance, they are suddenly required to speak or write on the\r\nquestion:\r\n\r\n“Should the Government own and operate the railroads?”\r\n\r\nThey have never read anything about it, perhaps. Therefore they inquire:\r\n\r\n“Where can we get some literature on the subject?”\r\n\r\nThese young people do not want someone else to write their speeches or\r\nessays; they want nothing more than to be told where to get the materials\r\nto work with—the data upon which to construct their own argument.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a boy I felt the need of that kind of help very keenly.\r\n\r\nHow was I to know what books contained the information sought?\r\n\r\nWho could tell me?\r\n\r\nI soon found that teachers did not love to be bored by inquiries of that\r\ncharacter, and therefore I had to browse around in the library at random\r\nfor what was wanted.\r\n\r\nIf the book needed was there, I generally found it, after wasting much\r\ntime in the search.\r\n\r\nIf it was not there, as frequently happened, I was at my row’s end. I had\r\nto debate without the full preparation which should have been made.\r\n\r\nTo help out many a student who may be troubled as I used to be, I\r\nam going to improvise and conduct in this magazine a modest little\r\n_Educational Department_.\r\n\r\nPrimarily it is meant for _the young people_. But the rule will be made\r\nas flexible as I feel like making it.\r\n\r\nAge limits are not fair—no matter whether Osler was joking or not.\r\n\r\nIt is not my plan or purpose to write anybody’s speech or essay; but,\r\nwhere there is a subject of real importance to be discussed by word or\r\npen, I am willing to _direct the preparation_ of the student by telling\r\nhim or her where the necessary information can be had.\r\n\r\nIt would perhaps not be improper for me to suggest some general ideas on\r\nthe subject to be discussed—these ideas to be worked out and put in form\r\nby the student.\r\n\r\nOften I might render good service to the boys and girls by telling them\r\nwhere the books they need can be bought at the lowest price.\r\n\r\nIt took me many years to learn how to buy books, and it is a thing worth\r\nknowing—unless you have more money than I ever had.\r\n\r\nThe letters written to me in this department will be published as\r\nwritten; but the names of the writers will be withheld.\r\n\r\nTherefore, no correspondent need be embarrassed in making inquiries.\r\n\r\nMy replies will be given in the magazine.\r\n\r\nHereafter all letters asking for information—historical, literary,\r\npolitical, economic—will be answered through the EDUCATIONAL DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\nP. S.—Students are requested not to ask help on this subject, viz.:\r\n\r\n“_Resolved_, That there is more happiness in the pursuit than in the\r\npossession.”\r\n\r\nThose whose duty it is to maintain “_the pursuit_” will please consult\r\nMr. Bryan; those who sustain “_the possession_” are referred to Mr.\r\nRoosevelt.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _Editorial Comment_\r\n\r\nThose orthodox partisan editors who sneered at my comment on W. R. Hearst\r\nas a man who _did_ things while others were talk—talk—talking, will\r\nplease study the election returns from Chicago and hand me out revised\r\nopinions.\r\n\r\nThat was a Hearst fight, and Hearst himself was personally in the thick\r\nof it. He said little and accomplished much.\r\n\r\nWould _still_ like to swap a score or two of mere talkers like—well, no\r\nmatter—for another such myth as Hearst.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA wise man—and his name is Dennis—has an article in the April number\r\nof _Everybody’s_ to prove that free trade has created in England that\r\npoverty-stricken mass of humanity which he includes under the general\r\nname of “Hooligan.”\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Robert Hunter, the Hooligans of the United States\r\naggregate 10,000,000—and we haven’t had any free trade, either.\r\n\r\nEvidently the wise Mr. Dennis has not located the true cause of poverty\r\nin England.\r\n\r\nIt was famine, and the high price of bread, which forced Sir Robert Peel\r\nto abandon protection and to carry free trade into effect.\r\n\r\nBread was cheapened and the cost of living reduced.\r\n\r\nDid _that_ inflict such great misery upon the poor?\r\n\r\nIf the wise Mr. Dennis will study the subject more thoroughly he will\r\nprobably reach the conclusion that poverty in England is the product\r\nof land monopoly, a vicious financial system and a governmental\r\nestablishment in which a lot of hereditary bloodsuckers prey upon the\r\nbody politic.\r\n\r\nFree trade is the law of nature; it never did, and never can produce\r\nnational misery, poverty or decadence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf the wise Mr. Dennis will study the subject thoroughly he will discover\r\nthat the Corn Laws of 1815 were passed for the purpose of giving special\r\nbenefits to the landlords of Great Britain. By the poor the act was\r\nregarded as such a direct attack upon themselves—such a barefaced\r\ndesign to make them pay higher prices for the necessaries of life—that\r\nresistance to the law grew riotous and had to be put down by force.\r\n\r\nSays Justin McCarthy, the historian:\r\n\r\n“The poor everywhere saw the bread of their family threatened, saw the\r\nfood of their children almost taken out of their mouths, and they broke\r\ninto wild extremes of anger.”\r\n\r\nBut the soldiers were called out, the riots put down, and a sufficient\r\nnumber of the poor hanged to quell the remainder.\r\n\r\n_Thus_ the land monopolists of Great Britain—many of whose titles to\r\ntheir enormous holdings are tainted with all manner of fraud and wrong\r\nenforced and odious law which robbed the poor to benefit the rich.\r\n\r\nIn 1817 the troops were used again to crush the laborers who were crying\r\nout against oppression.\r\n\r\nIn 1819 soldiers were used once more.\r\n\r\nThen the submission of despair brought quiet times until 1830, when\r\nthe people again attempted to throw off the hateful yoke of barbarous\r\nlaws. In the House of Commons Sir Francis Burdett denounced the Duke of\r\nWellington as\r\n\r\n“_Shamefully insensible to the suffering and distress which were\r\npainfully apparent throughout the land._”\r\n\r\n“O’Connell declared that many thousands of persons had to subsist in\r\nIreland _on three half-pence per day_.”\r\n\r\nA tolerably successful workingman sometimes got sixty-five cents a week,\r\nand the price of the four-pound loaf was _twenty-five cents_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom 1830 to 1836 matters went from bad to worse. Business was depressed,\r\ntrade stagnant, poverty severe in many parts of the country.\r\n\r\nIn 1838 a crisis came. Three-fifths of the manufacturing establishments\r\nof Lancashire shut down. Thousands of workmen were thrown adrift,\r\nmoneyless, foodless, desperate.\r\n\r\nIt was then that three great men, Cobden, Bright and Villiers, seized\r\nthe leadership of Discontent and began the famous crusade against\r\n_Protection_, as typified in the Corn Laws of Great Britain. “Vested\r\ninterests,” of course, raised the usual howl.\r\n\r\nThe land monopolists stubbornly closed up in lines of sullen opposition\r\nto reform. They beat off every attack, pocketing year after year the\r\nfamine prices which the people were compelled to pay for bread.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, in the summer of 1845, a cold, wet, sunless season fell\r\nupon the British Isles and the whole potato crop of Ireland—the sole\r\ndependence of the vast majority of the Irish people—rotted.\r\n\r\nThe food of Ireland was gone; in her poverty she could not pay the\r\nEnglish landlord’s price for bread, and the Corn Laws forbade her buying\r\nthe cheap bread of America and Continental Europe.\r\n\r\nIt was _then_ that Lord John Russell attacked the whole system of\r\n_Protection_ as “_the blight of commerce, the bane of agriculture, the\r\nsource of bitter divisions among classes_, THE CAUSE OF PENURY, FEVER AND\r\nCRIME AMONG THE PEOPLE.”\r\n\r\nIt was _then_ that the great Tory Minister, Sir Robert Peel, followed\r\nthe promptings of his heart and determined that the people should have\r\ncheaper food.\r\n\r\nHe abolished the Corn Laws, and conferred inestimable blessings upon the\r\ncommon people of his country.\r\n\r\nThe noble act cost him his political life—for that was the penalty which\r\noutraged land monopoly, led by Disraeli, inflicted upon its former chief.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Corn Laws were repealed in 1846.\r\n\r\nMr. Dennis comes along and tells us that _Free Trade_ is responsible for\r\n“Hooligan”—for poverty in England.\r\n\r\nMr. Rider Haggard—now in this country in the interest of Hooligan—ought\r\nto know as much about the poor of Great Britain as Dennis knows.\r\n\r\nWhat does Rider Haggard say?\r\n\r\nThat the present deplorable condition of the English poor _began with_\r\n1874.\r\n\r\nHow, then, can that condition be connected with the Corn Law repeal?\r\n\r\nMay it not be logically connected with legislation of more recent date?\r\n\r\nOr may it not be connected with economic developments elsewhere?\r\n\r\nTremendous changes in the conditions of people in Europe and America\r\nhave been brought about by financial legislation much more nearly\r\ncontemporaneous with 1874 than the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846.\r\n\r\nThen, again, the vast addition to the wheat and corn areas in the United\r\nStates alone have had a mighty influence on prices in Great Britain.\r\n\r\nIt may be that rents are so high in England that the tenant farmer finds\r\nit impossible to pay his tribute to the land monopolist, compete with\r\nAmerican grain fields, and have anything left for himself.\r\n\r\nIndeed, Mr. Haggard states that one of the reasons why the agricultural\r\nlaborer is so disheartened in England is that _there is no chance for him\r\nto become the owner of land_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn exchange says:\r\n\r\n“The headmaster of an English school says he read Roosevelt’s inaugural\r\nto his boys and asked them where it was found. Unanimously they answered,\r\n‘Jowett’s translation of Thucydides.’ Whereupon the headmaster gives\r\nus parallel columns to show that Pericles said it all before, on an\r\noccasion somewhat similar. But Teddy is too honest to crib; he was\r\ndeceived by his clerk on oratory. Let it go at that.”\r\n\r\nIf it is true that Mr. Roosevelt _did_ use one of the speeches of\r\nPericles as an inaugural address, Mr. Bryan may wish he had not been\r\nso quick with the announcement that it was a poor speech. Pericles is\r\ngenerally considered to have been an orator who would have compared not\r\nunfavorably with W. J. B. himself.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe India-rubber qualities of the Monroe Doctrine are being made manifest\r\nwith a vengeance.\r\n\r\nOnce we understood it to mean, in a general way, that Europe must “Hands\r\noff”—no more conquest, colonization, or extension of the European system\r\nto the American Continent.\r\n\r\nBy Mr. Cleveland, England was told, with firmness, that she couldn’t\r\nsteal Venezuela’s land, even though the theft consisted of the simple\r\ndevice of moving the boundary line.\r\n\r\nWith Mr. Roosevelt’s advent to power comes a decidedly new chapter in the\r\nevolution of the Monroe Doctrine.\r\n\r\nWe are to assume a sort of Trusteeship for adjacent governments.\r\n\r\nWe must see to it that they conduct themselves decently and in order.\r\nThey must pay their debts to citizens of other countries and behave\r\nthemselves generally in a way that meets our approval.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Roosevelt, in advancing the Monroe Doctrine to this extent, has\r\nundertaken a big contract for this country.\r\n\r\nIf we are to be the Policeman for South America, Santo Domingo, Cuba,\r\nMexico and Central America, we must, first of all, have a powerful navy.\r\n\r\nThis is clear to everybody.\r\n\r\nWhat is not so clear is that a powerful standing army will inevitably\r\nfollow—_as sure as fate, it will follow_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor it is certain that a natural result of our hectoring, bulldozing,\r\noverlord attitude toward countries like those mentioned will make them\r\nour bitter enemies. South America already hates us, and has cause to hate\r\nus.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which we sanctioned the collection of claims against\r\nVenezuela, by the warships of Europe will not be forgotten.\r\n\r\nThis feeling will be intensified by Mr. Roosevelt’s recent utterances,\r\nand will spread through all the peoples affected by it.\r\n\r\nIf we are to compel these governments to knuckle down to every Asphalt\r\nTrust, or other speculative syndicate, which enters the country for the\r\npurpose of exploitation, the time will certainly come when our attempts\r\nto make them conform to our standard of what is decent and orderly in\r\ndealing with plundering corporations will be resisted.\r\n\r\nWhat then?\r\n\r\nOur navy can bombard the cities of the coast, but will our marines leave\r\nthe ships and defeat the land forces of the interior?\r\n\r\nEvidently not.\r\n\r\nWhat, therefore, must we do?\r\n\r\nSend army against army, as we shall have sent navy against navy.\r\n\r\nConsequently the same policy which logically requires a powerful navy\r\nwill likewise require a powerful standing army.\r\n\r\n_And our masters know it!_\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Roosevelt:\r\n\r\nDo _you_, also, laugh at young Garfield?\r\n\r\n_Please_ don’t give us any more of that silly boy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMore than one-half the voters of Colorado cast their ballots for Alva\r\nAdams, candidate for Governor.\r\n\r\nBut Adams did not get the place.\r\n\r\nLess than half the voters supported James Peabody, and Peabody acted as\r\nGovernor for one day.\r\n\r\nNot a soul voted for Jesse McDonald for Governor, yet Jesse gets the\r\nwhole term of office, excepting the one day given to Peabody.\r\n\r\nThe voters of Colorado evidently enjoy self-government about as much as\r\nit can be enjoyed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _The Lady’s Slipper_\r\n\r\n                         BY CYRUS TOWNSEND BRADY\r\n        _Author of “The Two Captains,” “The Corner in Coffee,” “A\r\n           Little Traitor to the South,” “The Southerners,” etc._\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    I\r\n\r\n                          THE SLIPPER IS SOUGHT\r\n\r\nWhat happened to me the night before? I was not certain as to details,\r\nbut I recalled the main facts with singular distinctness. I had lost\r\nevery coin that I possessed. A hasty search of my pockets in the morning\r\ndisclosed the absence even of that one louis which, on account of\r\nits markings, I had resolved never to part with, save in the gravest\r\nemergency. I was stripped bare, “down to a gant-line,” as old Bucknall\r\nwould have said. That much was obvious. I had possessed no jewels save\r\nthe ring I had filched when I took the Frenchman’s purse. That, too, was\r\ngone. I suppose I played it away with the rest.\r\n\r\nI still had my sword. It was a serviceable blade, which I had purchased\r\nwith the Frenchman’s money so soon as I arrived in Paris. A gentleman and\r\nhis sword, backed by a stout heart—well, one might be in worse plight.\r\nBut as I thought about the night before I seemed to remember—and here\r\nwas where I was not quite clear—that I had affixed my name to certain\r\npieces of paper, I. O. U.’s! To what amount I was obligated by these\r\ntransactions I did not know. But whether it was for one franc or a\r\nthousand, I was unable to discharge the debt. My creditors must give me\r\ntime or—They were a jolly lot, those Frenchmen, and I had held up my end\r\nas long as the gold pieces lasted. America had taken no disgrace from my\r\nability to stand in a game and win or lose like a gentleman. True, it\r\nwas generally the latter that fell to my play.\r\n\r\nNow I was sick of it all! I hated wine and women and play. I wished, as\r\nnever before, that I were on the deck of a stout ship again, with the\r\nnew flag, the Stars and Stripes, fluttering from the gaff-end and the\r\nbreath of the salt wind in my face. This and a tidy Englishman of equal\r\nforce under our lee. Gods! That was a man’s work and a man’s place. This\r\ndrifting around from one gambling resort to another in Paris, with a\r\ncrowd of roysterers—and worse—this night after night at the tables—bah, I\r\nhad had enough of it!\r\n\r\nIt was a life I had never fancied, and if Dr. Franklin had been at home I\r\nhad never entered upon it. After I escaped from the British prison-ship,\r\nand after I took that Englishman’s purse on the highway—only he turned\r\nout to be a Frenchman, but it was then too late for me to alter my\r\nintention to provide myself with the sinews of war—and after I managed to\r\nget to Paris and found our Ambassador gone to Holland or Spain or some\r\nother outlandish country, what was I to do? With plenty of money, no\r\noccupation, no ship, nor any present chance of getting one, no friends,\r\nand a reckless, adventurous disposition, I fell in with a fast set, and\r\nthis was the outcome.\r\n\r\nI could not find her either, although I swear I searched high and low\r\nand spent not a little of the proceeds of my highway robbery in trying\r\nto run her down. There was no use in going over all this. I got up from\r\nthe couch on which I had thrown myself dressed as I was, staggered over\r\nto the table, splashed my face with water and caught a glimpse of myself\r\nin the little mirror that hung on the wall. Worn, haggard, bloodshot—my\r\nown father would scarce have known me. I was ashamed, bitterly so. I had\r\nnever been a gambler or a drinker, and I vowed that I would never be\r\nagain. I had played the fool once and I did not propose to do it a second\r\ntime. Yet these interesting resolutions were forced into the background\r\nby the demands of my present situation.\r\n\r\nWhat was I to do? Breakfast! I loathed the idea. Still, I must eat to\r\nlive. I hadn’t a cent with which to bless myself. What was the date? It\r\nwas the tenth—no, the eleventh—of the month. Dr. Franklin would be back\r\non the thirteenth. Once I could get speech with him all would be well,\r\nbut how was I to exist until then?\r\n\r\nI sat down by the window and tried to think of some device. God knows my\r\nsituation was critical, but I declare that I could only think of her!\r\nPerhaps my inability to find her—for she had vanished as completely as if\r\nthe earth had opened and swallowed her—had made me reckless, careless,\r\na willing prey to the knaves who had brought me to this pass. I will\r\nadmit, even then, that I loved her. I closed my eyes and I could see\r\nher as I saw her that evening outside of Paris. I could hear her scream\r\nin the hands of those ruffians. I went over the whole thing as I had\r\ndone a thousand times. My rush at the villains! I was a pretty hand at\r\ncudgel-playing as well as a good swordsman, for I had no weapon but a\r\nstout stick.\r\n\r\nThe first fellow I caught fairly on the head, and he dropped like a\r\nfelled bullock. I put my hand up and could feel a little partially healed\r\nscar along my cheek where the bullet of the one-eyed scoundrel cut a lock\r\nof hair and grazed me. He got a crack on his pistol arm which put him\r\nout of action. I could still see his face, convulsed with pain and rage,\r\nhis one eye shooting fire at me as he retreated before me. The other\r\nrascal was a coward, for he fled immediately. I shall never forget the\r\nlook on Mademoiselle’s face when she thanked me! They had torn her mask\r\noff when they had dragged her from her horse. I found it again and also\r\nmanaged to catch her horse.\r\n\r\nAlthough I was dressed like a French peasant I think she realized that I\r\nwas of gentle blood. She was surprised at the ease with which I mounted\r\nher on her horse, and when she gave me that louis—my hand went to my\r\nbreast. Yes, it still hung there! I hadn’t gambled that away, thank\r\nGod!—and, as I promptly returned her another, she seemed to understand. I\r\nwonder what she did with hers? She told me that I had not only saved her\r\nfrom assault but that I had done more, I had saved the honor of France,\r\nand that she would some day prove her gratitude. Then she galloped away\r\nfrom me and left me standing staring in the road like a fool, madly in\r\nlove with her!\r\n\r\nAye, this evidenced my folly, I will admit, but as they say here, “What\r\nwould you?” She was the first lady I had seen in three years of cruising,\r\nand such a woman! If you had seen her you would have understood. How I\r\nhad searched for her! Blue eyes, dark hair; tall, exquisitely molded,\r\ngraceful figure; dainty hands and feet—this vague description might have\r\nfitted any woman or a million, and she was one of that million. It was no\r\nuse. I should never see her again, and if I saw her now, disgraced as I\r\nwas, I must avoid her. So absorbed was I in these miserable musings that\r\nI hadn’t heeded a tap at the door.\r\n\r\n“_Ma foi!_” cried a rather shrill, metallic voice as a man opened the\r\ndoor and stepped within. “My dear friend, I have rapped several times,\r\nand so I took the liberty....”\r\n\r\n“Oh, come in by all means, Monsieur du Trémigon,” I replied, rising and\r\nwelcoming the newcomer, although with no great cordiality.\r\n\r\nHe was the hatefulest of all the crowd with whom I had cast my lot since\r\nI had been in Paris, and I more than suspected it was to him that I had\r\npassed those little pieces of paper which began more and more definitely\r\nto impress themselves upon my recollection.\r\n\r\n“I suppose,” I said, “that you have come to settle our accounts of last\r\nnight, Monsieur?”\r\n\r\n“There is no haste about that,” he returned politely enough, “but since\r\nyou insist, as well now as any other time.”\r\n\r\n“I shall be honest with you, Marquis,” I returned bluntly; “I’m afraid I\r\nshall have to ask your indulgence for a short time.”\r\n\r\nHe drew from his pocket a package of papers and laid them on the table.\r\nI took them up as I spoke, and although I am no great hand at figures,\r\nI saw that the total was appalling. My heart sank, but I flatter myself\r\nthat I displayed as equable a demeanor as the man opposite me. It has\r\nalways been my practice to put a bold face on everything.\r\n\r\n“Pray give yourself no uneasiness whatever about these little matters,”\r\nsaid the Marquis in his most genial manner—and the more gentle and kindly\r\nhe was, strange to say, the more I hated him! “Or rather,” he continued,\r\ninterrupting me as I began to speak, “I can show you a way to discharge\r\nthem with little difficulty to yourself, and that immediately.”\r\n\r\n“Show me that way!” I cried. “I will avail myself of it at once. To tell\r\nyou the truth, I am sick of the life I have led in this city.”\r\n\r\n“I thought,” said du Trémigon, smiling meaningly, “that you were scarcely\r\nsuited for——”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” I cried, glad for the chance to vent my indignation\r\nupon someone. “Didn’t I bear myself like a gentleman?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, quite so, entirely so. You misapprehend me, my dear Burnham,” he\r\nprotested.\r\n\r\n“Well, I dare say you are right,” I replied carelessly, too troubled to\r\nquarrel, “I am a sailor. The sea is my world. I am at home there or on\r\nmy father’s plantation in the Carolinas. But this is nothing to you. The\r\npoint is, I am in your debt.”\r\n\r\n“This ring, Monsieur,” said the Marquis, lifting his hand. “Do you know\r\nwhose it is?”\r\n\r\n“Yours, I suppose, since you won it,” I replied. “It was mine.”\r\n\r\n“Pardon me, it was originally mine.”\r\n\r\n“What!”\r\n\r\n“Mine.”\r\n\r\n“Then you are——?”\r\n\r\n“The gentleman whose purse you kindly relieved him of a few weeks ago in\r\nEngland.”\r\n\r\n“Impossible!” I cried.\r\n\r\n“Impossible, but true, Monsieur. I recognized you when I met you last\r\nweek at Varesi’s”—the name of a popular gambling resort—“I wasn’t quite\r\nsure, however. At least, I had no proof until last night. This ring? You\r\nremember taking it?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, perfectly,” I said.\r\n\r\n“And this louis?” He pulled out the curiously marked coin. “A pocket\r\npiece I have had for a long time. I should know it among a thousand.”\r\n\r\n“You have established your case,” I answered defiantly. “You understand\r\nthat I am no common thief or highwayman? I am an American naval officer.\r\nServing under Cunningham on a privateer, I was captured, thrown into\r\nprison, escaped. Being penniless in the enemy’s country I determined to\r\ntake the purse of the first traveler who came along. I took you for an\r\nEnglishman. When I knew you were French, it was too late. I can only say\r\nthat I will give you another I. O. U. for all that I have despoiled you\r\nof, and so soon as I can communicate with America you shall have the\r\nmoney.”\r\n\r\nThe Marquis showed his white teeth in a grin—how I loathed him!—waving\r\nhis hands as he did so.\r\n\r\n“As to that, we will discuss it presently. Meanwhile, what did you do\r\nwith the papers you robbed me of in England?”\r\n\r\n“Tore them to pieces and scattered them in the first river I crossed.”\r\n\r\n“Damnation!” cried the man. “I could stand the loss of the money, but the\r\nloss of those papers wellnigh ruined me!”\r\n\r\n“How so?”\r\n\r\n“I was carrying some secret despatches to the British Government, in\r\nspite of the war, and your blundering made me fail in my mission.”\r\n\r\n“Blundering!” I cried.\r\n\r\n“Pray be calm, Monsieur,” he exclaimed; “the word may have been\r\nill-advised, but you will recognize that some consideration is due me.”\r\n\r\nHe looked meaningly at the little pile of notes. I followed his glance,\r\nsnatched up another piece of paper, scribbled a line on it and added it\r\nto the heap.\r\n\r\n“That covers your loss, including the ring.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur Burnham,” said the Marquis, “are you aware of the exceedingly\r\ndifficult position into which you have got yourself?”\r\n\r\n“I should say I am! Being absolutely without funds, I am forced to\r\nask total strangers to accept my bare word that I will discharge my\r\nobligations so soon as I hear from America. This, with the seas swarming\r\nwith British ships, may be a matter of months.”\r\n\r\n“There is your Ambassador. He knows you, doubtless?”\r\n\r\n“Dr. Franklin doesn’t know me from Adam. He’s a Philadelphia Quaker, and\r\nI am from North Carolina. He has never seen me, nor I him. He knows my\r\nfather and family, though. If there were any of our officers in the city,\r\nif Commodore Jones or Dick Dale had only returned from Texel, I should be\r\nall right, but as it is, I am completely at your mercy.”\r\n\r\nI hated to say that word, but there was no help for it. The Marquis bowed\r\ngracefully.\r\n\r\n“Your remark is singularly accurate, Monsieur. At my mercy!”\r\n\r\nHe opened his mouth and tapped his white teeth with two of his white\r\nfingers. I wanted to choke him. Why, I could not say, for he had been\r\nconsiderate, and I owed him a lot of money. I had robbed him in England,\r\nand, besides, I had put him to serious inconvenience.\r\n\r\n“At my mercy,” he repeated, nodding.\r\n\r\n“I have admitted that fact,” I said sharply. “I do not see that it is\r\nnecessary to remind me of it again.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, pardon me. You Americans are so impetuous. Cultivate calmness, my\r\nfriend—English phlegm, if you will. It is a most valuable asset in any\r\ngame.”\r\n\r\n“That’s as may be, Marquis, but I play no more games with you.”\r\n\r\n“Pardon me again,” he returned coolly; “we play yet one more hand,\r\nMonsieur, and I have the deal.”\r\n\r\n“What are you driving at?”\r\n\r\n“I told you there was a way by which you could discharge your\r\nobligations.”\r\n\r\n“Declare it then, and let us close this transaction!”\r\n\r\n“You are doubtless unaware, and I speak to you in confidence, that my\r\nlarge estates are greatly encumbered. I have a passion for play. I do\r\nnot always enjoy the fortune I have had with you, and—” He laughed as he\r\nspoke. “In short, I find myself in very straitened circumstances.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose you want your money and want it quick?” I burst out. “I can\r\nunderstand and I promise you——”\r\n\r\n“There you go again, Monsieur. I want money, it is true. I was born\r\nwanting money, I have lived wanting money, and, I suppose, I shall die\r\nwanting money.”\r\n\r\nYou won’t have any use for it after that, I thought, but all I said was:\r\n“Proceed, Monsieur.”\r\n\r\n“You are doubtless unaware, also, that Mademoiselle Gabrielle de Rivau,\r\nComtesse de Villars in her own right, granddaughter of the Duc de\r\nRivau-Huet, is my cousin?”\r\n\r\n“I have never heard of the young lady, but I recognize the honor of the\r\nrelationship,” I said coldly.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis was not devoid of wit. His eye flashed, but he proceeded\r\ndeliberately:\r\n\r\n“Quite so. Her grandfather is my grandfather also. She is one of the\r\nrichest women in France. Our respective parents arranged a marriage\r\nbetween us when we were children. The carrying out of that contract\r\ndepends entirely on three people, the young lady, the Duc de Rivau-Huet\r\nand myself. It was stipulated that no constraint was to be used,\r\nand that, when she reached her twentieth year, she was to give her\r\nconsent without pressure, freely and willingly. If she did so, and her\r\ngrandfather interposed no objection, and I desired it, we were to be\r\nmarried. If not”—he shrugged his shoulders—“I lose.”\r\n\r\n“Lose what?”\r\n\r\n“The lady and, incidentally, her fortune.”\r\n\r\nI confessed to a very languid interest in the love affairs of the Marquis\r\nand the lady, but for politeness’ sake I asked him another question.\r\n\r\n“Permit me, since you have broached the subject, does the lady consent or\r\nrefuse?”\r\n\r\n“She consents, but the Duke refuses.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!”\r\n\r\n“But I hope that his refusal is not irrevocable.”\r\n\r\n“For your sake I trust so,” I replied. “Yet I fail to see how this\r\nconcerns me.”\r\n\r\n“You shall learn directly. Mademoiselle de Villars is one of the Queen’s\r\nmaids of honor. She usually resides at the Court at Versailles. For this\r\nweek, however, she is on leave of absence, I have learned, and is in\r\nresidence at the Hôtel de Rivau-Huet in Paris.”\r\n\r\n“Yes?” I said interrogatively. I was beginning to have some curiosity as\r\nto whither all this tended.\r\n\r\n“As I said, the Duke seems insensible to the advantage of an alliance\r\nwith me.”\r\n\r\nNo wonder, I thought, but I took good care not to voice my feelings.\r\n\r\n“I have decided to compel him to consent.”\r\n\r\n“And Mademoiselle de Villars?” I questioned suspiciously.\r\n\r\n“She also wishes it. I may say”—he simpered disgustedly—“she is more\r\nanxious than I.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur du Trémigon,” I said sternly, repressing with difficulty an\r\ninclination to kick him, “do you assure me of the truth of what you have\r\nsaid?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly.”\r\n\r\n“On your word of honor as a gentleman?”\r\n\r\n“As a gentleman and as a noble of France, Monsieur.”\r\n\r\nI ought to have known, but I did not, and there seemed to be nothing for\r\nme to do but accept his statement.\r\n\r\n“How do you propose to get the Duke’s consent?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“There is a way to apply pressure to him, Monsieur, which will ... let us\r\nsay ... induce his consent.”\r\n\r\n“You wish to compromise her in her grandfather’s eyes?” I said, fathoming\r\nhis meaning at last.\r\n\r\n“Exactly.”\r\n\r\n“But with her consent....”\r\n\r\n“Your intuition does you credit.”\r\n\r\n“That’s more than your intention does you,” I burst out scornfully.\r\n\r\n“I can afford to indulge you in these little pleasantries, my friend,” he\r\nreturned, with an evil look, “because....”\r\n\r\n“Why?” I cried.\r\n\r\n“Because I intend that you shall be my agent in the little process.”\r\n\r\n“You are reckoning without your host, Monsieur,” I said quickly. I was\r\nboiling with rage.\r\n\r\n“But not without my servant, Monsieur.”\r\n\r\n“Servant?” I raged.\r\n\r\n“Yes. Do you realize that I have but to place these things in the hands\r\nof the authorities to have you clapped into prison?”\r\n\r\n“I have been in prison before and got out. I can stand it again—for the\r\nsake of a woman.”\r\n\r\n“You will doubtless get out of the prison into which I shall put you,\r\nbut it will be to go to the hangman, or to the headsman if you can prove\r\nyour gentle blood.”\r\n\r\n“What!”\r\n\r\n“You forget that little transaction in England. You are a highway robber!\r\nI have evidence enough to convict you beyond doubt.”\r\n\r\n“The French Government would never....”\r\n\r\n“The French Government is angry enough over the loss of those papers, and\r\nthe punishment for highway robbery is death,” he sneered.\r\n\r\n“My God!” I cried.\r\n\r\n“’Tis useless to appeal to Him,” mocked du Trémigon. “Rather do you fall\r\nback on your mother-wit—if you have any—to help you.”\r\n\r\n“What do you wish me to do?” I asked desperately.\r\n\r\n“’Tis very simple. We are about the same height and build. We do not look\r\nunlike——”\r\n\r\n“You flatter me!”\r\n\r\n“’Tis the fact that does that,” he replied, bowing deeply. “In the dusk\r\nyou can easily pass for me, especially if you wear a familiar suit of my\r\nclothes. I will get you into the grounds of the Hôtel de Rivau-Huet below\r\nMademoiselle’s apartments. The building is vine-covered. Being a sailor\r\nyou can easily scale the wall and enter her chamber. You are to bring me\r\nthence some article of personal wearing apparel—say a slipper, or a ring,\r\nor——”\r\n\r\n“Is that all?”\r\n\r\n“That’s all.”\r\n\r\n“Why don’t you do it yourself?”\r\n\r\n“It is hardly necessary to enter upon that, Monsieur.”\r\n\r\n“If I am to do the thing,” I replied hotly, “I must know everything.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, the Duc de Rivau-Huet has threatened me with imprisonment if\r\nhe catches me in his hôtel again.”\r\n\r\n“And you wish me to take that risk?”\r\n\r\nThe Frenchman shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n“I am to do this at the peril of my life?”\r\n\r\n“It seems to me,” said the Marquis equably, “that your life is forfeit\r\nif you don’t do it, and——”\r\n\r\n“Enough!” I answered. “I am in your power. When I made the serious\r\nmistake of taking you for a gentleman I began my ruin. I’m sorry I didn’t\r\nkill you in England. I suppose there’s no help for it. I must do the\r\nwork. When do you wish this adventure undertaken?”\r\n\r\n“Tonight. If you will come to my rooms, I will fit you out, give you the\r\nplan of the hôtel and make all other arrangements.”\r\n\r\n“And those papers?”\r\n\r\n“They shall be returned to you when you place what you secure from the\r\nroom in my hands.”\r\n\r\n“What assurance have I as to that?”\r\n\r\n“The word of a gentleman.”\r\n\r\n“In your case I prefer something else.”\r\n\r\nThe Marquis flushed angrily. Why he controlled himself I do not know,\r\nunless it was because he was so desperately anxious to carry out his plan\r\nand I was his only instrument.\r\n\r\n“What do you propose?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“To go before a notary and draw up an agreement, leaving the papers in\r\nhis hands, including the ring and the coin, and a signed statement,\r\nacquitting me of complication in the robbery. These papers he is to give\r\nto me in the morning, if I succeed. Furthermore, I won’t go into the\r\nmatter without the assistance of an old sailor with whom I cruised.”\r\n\r\n“Take as many assistants as you please, Monsieur,” said the Marquis; “and\r\nnow we will go to my apartments. Will you honor me?”\r\n\r\nHe rose and offered me his arm.\r\n\r\n“I have to do your dirty work,” I replied, “and that obliges me to walk\r\nby your side, I suppose, but it doesn’t compel me to take your arm.”\r\n\r\nMy soul revolted against carrying out my part of the plot, even though by\r\nso doing I was obliging a lady. True, she might be—and if his words were\r\ntrue, she was—in love with du Trémigon, but I was sure she could not know\r\nhim as I knew him. Besides, what were the love affairs of the Marquis\r\nand his cousin to me? I had no personal interest in either of them.\r\n\r\nAll I had to do was to fetch a slipper or some personal belonging from\r\nher chamber, as she herself desired. The long and short of it was that I\r\nwas resolved to do it. I had to!\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\n                          THE SLIPPER IS FOUND\r\n\r\nFrom some servant in the Duc de Rivau-Huet’s hôtel, du Trémigon had\r\nlearned that the Comtesse de Villars was to be from home that night. He\r\narranged to have me passed through the gate. After that I was to look\r\nout for myself. The Duke’s hôtel, which was surrounded by ample grounds,\r\nwas just outside the city walls. The Marquis told me that, dressed in\r\nhis clothes and with a cloak he was accustomed to wear, I should very\r\nwell pass for him, and that in all probability no one would molest me\r\nunless I fell in with Éspiau, the Duke’s body-servant, or some of the\r\nupper officers of the household. The domestics were well affected toward\r\nhim, and as all the world loves a lover, they would be disposed rather to\r\nencourage than to hinder.\r\n\r\nDu Trémigon, with singular parsimony, I thought, had designed a rather\r\nshabby suit for my use. I insisted upon seeing his wardrobe and selected\r\nthe handsomest garments he possessed. He protested, but vainly, for I\r\nsaid that I must be dressed like a gentleman. He pointed out that I would\r\nprobably tear and certainly soil his court suit in climbing. I returned\r\nthat if I carried out his enterprise and won him a rich wife he could\r\nwell afford to lose a suit, whereas if I were caught and shot it would be\r\nsome consolation to me to know that I was well dressed for dying.\r\n\r\nI took a sword from the rare collection of weapons which he had in his\r\napartments. I may not be much of a card player, but I pride myself that I\r\nknow a weapon, and I chose a blade that I could depend upon. I got two\r\npistols for myself and two for worthy Master Bucknall. Bucknall was an\r\nold shipmate of mine. I knew I could depend upon him. We had fought side\r\nby side on several cruises, and although he had not been with me when\r\nI was captured, he had appeared in Paris after a shipwreck in which he\r\nhad been picked up by a French frigate. I found him penniless, and, of\r\ncourse, took care of him, intending to take him with me when I saw Dr.\r\nFranklin and arranged to go back to America. The Marquis had him fetched\r\nfrom his lodging, and I explained the whole situation to the worthy\r\nseaman.\r\n\r\nBucknall was to remain concealed in the grounds beneath Mademoiselle’s\r\nroom while I was within. I didn’t care to be taken in the rear, and I\r\nknew if an alarm were given, that Bucknall would keep a way of escape\r\nopen for me as long as he could. To him I gave my sword and pistols.\r\n\r\nI had studied a plan of the chateau and I knew the lay of the land\r\nand the position of the chambers perfectly. A bath, a rest and a meal\r\ncompleted my preparations. No, I forget one thing. I knew that many a\r\ndoor that will not open to iron and steel is facile to a golden key, and\r\nI made du Trémigon provide me with a rouleau of louis. He did it with an\r\nill grace. In the first place he had none too many, and, in the second, I\r\nsuppose, he thought he had laid out enough in the adventure. I insisted,\r\nhowever, giving him in lieu thereof another signed paper to add to his\r\ncollection. This and the visit to the notary, where I saw things made\r\nsecure from my point of view, filled the day.\r\n\r\nAt eight o’clock we sallied forth. Du Trémigon had furnished us with a\r\ncouple of horses. We had no difficulty passing the gates—he had provided\r\nus with the password—and finding the Duke’s mansion. The Marquis did not\r\naccompany us. He intended to give out that he had paid a visit to the\r\nCountess in her chamber, and in proof of it was to exhibit her slipper.\r\nThe Countess, being at a masked ball where no one could recognize her\r\nfor hours, could not disprove his statement. Of course, if anybody saw\r\nhim elsewhere his plan would fail, so he was to lie close and await our\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nWhen we came near the place I left the horses in care of an innkeeper to\r\nwhom du Trémigon had recommended me. I gave instructions to have them\r\nready for instant service at any time. I expected that we would be back\r\nbefore midnight. Then Bucknall and I walked boldly down the road toward\r\nthe gate of the mansion. Du Trémigon had told us that his servant was\r\none-eyed, so Bucknall was disguised by a patch over one eye, which gave\r\nhim great inconvenience, by the way, and at which, sailor-like, the old\r\nsea-dog growled mightily. I drew the Marquis’s cloak up around my neck,\r\npulled my hat down, and assumed as well as I could his mincing gait and\r\nmanner. In the dark we might well pass for du Trémigon and his servant.\r\nThe porter at the gate was expecting us. He made no difficulty about\r\npassing us through. Then we were left to shift for ourselves.\r\n\r\nThe night was dark and chill. There were no dogs in the yard. The Duke\r\nkept his hounds in the country. No one disturbed us as we made our way\r\ncautiously along the wall under the trees to the window of the Countess’s\r\napartment. A few lights showed here and there through the different\r\nopenings on this side of the house. Among them a faint illumination came\r\nfrom the window beneath which we stood. I looked at it with interest. It\r\nseemed that no one could be in the room. The light was probably a single\r\ncandle, left burning in case of need. This agreed with our information.\r\n\r\nMaking sure that no one saw us, we crossed the grass and stopped under\r\nthe window. The house was an old one. There were buttresses against the\r\nwall, and the one nearest the Countess’s window was in a dilapidated\r\ncondition. A vine ran all over this side of the building. I was always\r\nactive and I had not dissipated in Paris long enough to have lost my\r\nnerve. I glanced upward. It would not be difficult. If the vine held—and\r\nits stem was as thick as my wrist—the ascent would be easy. Wrapping my\r\ncloak around me so as to protect du Trémigon’s clothes, and with a word\r\nof caution to Bucknall, whom I saw secreted comfortably in the black\r\nrecess between the buttress and the wall, I quickly made my way up. So\r\nlong as I had the assistance of the buttress it was nearly as easy as\r\nwalking up a stair, or as simple as climbing the battens on the side of\r\na ship. The last yard was more difficult, but I managed it with a few\r\nscratches and with a minimum of noise.\r\n\r\nI had no opportunity to peer into the room or see what was before me.\r\nI reached the sill, threw my leg over it and stepped quietly within. I\r\nstood by the window listening. Neither from outside nor inside was there\r\nany sound. I had been unobserved.\r\n\r\nSatisfying myself on this point, I stepped back from the window to avoid\r\nthe line of light and looked about me. The room appeared to be a woman’s\r\nsitting-room. There was an air of refinement, of grace and culture about\r\nit that made me sure. There were books on the table, pictures on the\r\nwalls, a piece of some sort of needlework thrown carelessly on a chair.\r\nSeveral doors opened from the room. According to the plan, that on the\r\nright should be the Countess’s boudoir, and beyond that her bedchamber. I\r\nstepped softly across to this door. I listened. There was no one in the\r\nother room apparently. I turned the handle carefully and entered.\r\n\r\nJust beyond me was the door of the bedroom. Repeating my performance, I\r\nwalked over to it and listened. No one was there. I opened the door and\r\nlooked in. Like the others this room was lighted by a single candle. Like\r\nthe others, it was unoccupied.\r\n\r\nIt was quite evident that du Trémigon’s informant was correct. The\r\nCountess was out. Her maid, who should have been on guard, had taken\r\nadvantage of her mistress’s absence to go off on a little jaunt of\r\nher own, I supposed. I closed the door of the bedroom softly and began\r\na hasty examination of the boudoir. A dress lay across a chair. A\r\nmagnificent costume, it seemed to me.\r\n\r\nA pair of shoes—a ravishing pair of tiny shoes—stood on the floor at the\r\nbottom of the gown. These might do. But no, they had not been worn; they\r\nwere entirely new. Du Trémigon had insisted upon something personal and\r\nfamiliar. I walked over to the dressing-table, which was covered with a\r\nmass of silver and porcelain. They bore the de Villars crest, but so did\r\na number of things in du Trémigon’s own home. None of them would answer.\r\n\r\nI remembered the room contained a closet. Nerving myself further, I\r\nopened the nearest door. On the floor, confronting me, lay a pair of\r\nsmall, worn, blue satin slippers with red heels. They were slightly\r\nshaped to the feet of the wearer from long usage. There were no other\r\nfeet in the world that could wear those slippers, in all probability. I\r\nstooped and picked one up. It would serve admirably.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   III\r\n\r\n                        THE SLIPPER IS RENOUNCED\r\n\r\nWith the slipper still in my hand, I turned to find myself confronting a\r\nwoman!\r\n\r\nShe was standing at the door leading to the antechamber. How long she had\r\nbeen there I knew not. Indeed, after the first start of surprise, I had\r\nroom for but one thought. The woman was she whom I had rescued on the way\r\nto Paris, with whom I had fallen madly in love! For whom I had sought\r\nhigh and low—whom I had prayed that I might see again.\r\n\r\nShe was looking at me composedly from under level brows. I observed that\r\nher hand was on the bell-cord.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” she said—and oh, how well I remembered her voice—“if you\r\nmove, or make a sound, I pull the bell. My servants are within a\r\nmoment’s call. You will be overpowered immediately.”\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle,” I returned, disguising my natural voice as well as I\r\ncould and thanking the Lord that my French was perfect, and that in the\r\ndim light, she did not recognize me apparently, “I am at your service.”\r\n\r\n“I wish,” she continued, “to talk with you. The situation amuses me.”\r\n\r\nShe spoke as she might in the presence of some new spectacle. Her manner\r\nassured me that her interest in me was entirely impersonal. She was tired\r\nand bored. This was a new experience apparently which she wished to\r\nmake the most of. I could think of nothing adequate to say, so I bowed\r\nprofoundly.\r\n\r\n“What is your name and what are you doing here?”\r\n\r\n“My name, Mademoiselle, matters nothing.” In my agitation I forgot, and\r\nspoke in my natural voice. She started as she lifted the candle and\r\nlooked keenly at me.\r\n\r\n“Why!” she exclaimed, “’tis the man of the highway!”\r\n\r\nI do not know whether I was glad or sorry to hear her say those words. At\r\nfirst I thought to deny it, but somehow it was impossible.\r\n\r\n“You have discovered me, Mademoiselle,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Then you were masquerading as a sailor. Now——”\r\n\r\nShe looked me over from head to heel, and I have been told since that\r\nI made a brave appearance. Du Trémigon had displayed excellent taste\r\nin clothing, and this was his handsomest suit. I stood proudly erect,\r\nputting a bold face on the situation, with one hand upon my sword, my\r\nhat in the other, which also held the slipper, as if I were about to be\r\npresented to the King.\r\n\r\n“Now,” she said, “you are masquerading as a gentleman.”\r\n\r\n“Pardon, Mademoiselle,” I returned, “I am a gentleman”—she put up her\r\nhand, but I would not be denied—“masquerading as a ... thief.”\r\n\r\nI blessed her in my heart for her hesitation over that word.\r\n\r\n“Is it because you have stolen the Marquis du Trémigon’s clothes?—for I\r\nbelieve, if I am not mistaken, they are his.”\r\n\r\n“Your observation does you infinite credit, Mademoiselle.”\r\n\r\n“I thought so. Is it for that reason you are masquerading as a thief?”\r\n\r\n“Because I have come here without regard to clothes to—” I protested.\r\n\r\n“To take my jewels?” she interrupted.\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle!” I cried, starting back, the blood flaming in my face\r\nagain. “You think——”\r\n\r\n“I think nothing, Monsieur. I discover a strange man in my apartments\r\nat night. He says that he is masquerading as a thief. What else am I to\r\ninfer?”\r\n\r\nI was dumb before her merciless logic.\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle,” I began desperately, “I deeply regret——”\r\n\r\n“So, too, do I. I knew—at least I thought I knew, on that day, the day\r\nyou did me such brave service—that you were a gentleman, in spite of what\r\nyou wore, yet—well, I see I was deceived.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t say that!” I protested again.\r\n\r\n“Why not, Monsieur?”\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle, I am here in defiance of every rule of propriety, I will\r\nadmit. You may well think me a thief,” I began, with passionate haste,\r\n“but I am only following your example.”\r\n\r\n“How, sir?” she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“You, too, are not guiltless of robbery.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” she asked, indignantly drawing herself up.\r\n\r\nOh, how magnificent she looked! I wanted to throw myself at her feet and\r\nconfess everything, but I did not—then.\r\n\r\n“You have stolen my heart, Mademoiselle.”\r\n\r\n“And you came to look for it in my jewel-case?” She laughed somewhat\r\ncontemptuously.\r\n\r\n“I have come for yours in exchange,” said I; although I had a neat\r\nopening in her question, I judged it best to let it pass.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur!”\r\n\r\n“I am a poor sailor, Mademoiselle, but I have sought you throughout the\r\nland. I babbled everywhere as I ran of blue eyes, dark hair, a witching\r\nface. I found you—nowhere!”\r\n\r\nThere was a ring of truth in these words—although of course it did not\r\nexplain my presence there—that I believe influenced her.\r\n\r\n“’Tis impossible, Monsieur—” she began at last.\r\n\r\n“Look into the glass, Mademoiselle, and see how believable it is,” I\r\nbroke in.\r\n\r\n“That you should have come here on such an errand and——”\r\n\r\n“I would go to the end of the world if I might find you there,\r\nMademoiselle,” I boldly said, taking a step nearer to her.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur!” she cried, clutching the bell-rope once more. “Pray keep your\r\ndistance.”\r\n\r\n“I am content merely to look at you,” I said, stopping short instantly.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur, on your word of honor as a—” She paused.\r\n\r\n“As a thief?” I questioned.\r\n\r\n“As a gentleman,” she said softly, and I could have kissed her feet for\r\nthat. “Did you come here for me?”\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle,” I said, “it is a long story. You have honored me by your\r\nconversation. You found something gentle in me on the road and in spite\r\nof appearances—that are so grievously against me now—you have reposed a\r\ncertain degree of confidence in me. Will you allow me to tell you briefly\r\nwho and what I am?”\r\n\r\n“I am anxious to learn it.”\r\n\r\n“Will you not be seated? You may release the bell-rope, on my word,\r\nwithout danger. I would rather die than harm you. Indeed, my greatest\r\nambition is to devote my life to your service.”\r\n\r\n“Fine words, Monsieur, and such as I have often heard from other\r\ncavaliers.”\r\n\r\n“I doubt it not, Mademoiselle. Such beauty of person and grace of mind as\r\nyours cannot remain unchallenged. This shall be my excuse.”\r\n\r\n“No more of this, if you please, but of yourself.” It was ineffable\r\ncondescension, and you may imagine how I appreciated the honor.\r\n\r\n“My name is Francis Burnham. My family on the distaff side is\r\nFrench—Huguenot. The blood, I believe, is noble. My great-grandfather\r\nwas an English gentleman. My father met my mother in North Carolina. The\r\nacreage my father owns is equal to a French county.”\r\n\r\n“You are an American, then?”\r\n\r\n“I have that honor. I am also an officer in the American Navy. My country\r\nis ill provided with warships. Many naval officers have been forced to\r\naccept positions in privateers. I was a lieutenant in Captain Gustavus\r\nCunningham’s privateer ship, the Revenge. We were captured by a British\r\nfrigate and taken to a British prison-ship. I escaped thence and was on\r\nmy way to Paris, to see Dr. Franklin, when I had the good fortune to\r\nbe of some slight service to you. That gold piece you gave me, I have\r\nit here.” I saw her hand involuntarily move to her breast and my heart\r\nleaped as it assured me that she also had retained and cherished the coin\r\nI had forced upon her. “I have loved you ever since I saw you that day,\r\nMademoiselle. I have sought you in vain only to find you tonight.”\r\n\r\n“That, Monsieur,” she said quietly, “does not yet explain your presence\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\nI was dumb again.\r\n\r\n“How did you discover my abode?”\r\n\r\nI could make no reply.\r\n\r\n“How did you learn my name?”\r\n\r\nUnthinking, I answered:\r\n\r\n“I do not know your name at this moment.”\r\n\r\n“I am Gabrielle de Rivau, Comtesse de Villars.”\r\n\r\n“Great heavens!” I exclaimed.\r\n\r\nWould you believe it? It had not occurred to me for a moment that this\r\nwas she! I had jumped to the conclusion that she was perhaps some friend\r\nof the Countess’s. I had never dreamed that fate could deal me so sorry\r\na trick as to involve me in such a part against the woman I adored. “Are\r\nyou the Comtesse de Villars?”\r\n\r\n“I am.”\r\n\r\n“I did not know.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur Burnham, you are full of mystery.”\r\n\r\n“I have told you nothing but the truth, Mademoiselle.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but not all of it. Is it not so?”\r\n\r\nI was silent.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur, do you not realize that I have committed a great imprudence in\r\nallowing you to converse with me here alone, under such circumstances?\r\nThat my duty should be to pull the bell and hand you over to the Duke’s\r\nretainers for punishment? That you owe much to my forbearance?”\r\n\r\n“I realize all that you say, Mademoiselle, and I am filled with shame.”\r\n\r\n“Why, then, are you here? What are you doing in the Marquis du Trémigon’s\r\nclothing? What is that you hold?” I thoughtlessly lifted my hand. “My\r\nslipper!” she exclaimed, flushing in her turn. “You have been in my\r\ncloset yonder. What does it all mean?”\r\n\r\n“I will speak!” I replied desperately, resolved to make a clean breast of\r\nthe whole affair. “I am in the power of the Marquis du Trémigon. I owe\r\nhim money.”\r\n\r\n“Heaven help you!”\r\n\r\n“I am surprised to hear you say that!” I exclaimed in amazement.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” she said quickly, disregarding my remark, “my purse is on the\r\ntable. Let me discharge my obligation. Take what you will.”\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle, for God’s sake, think not so unkindly of me! He threatened\r\nme with imprisonment for debt. That is nothing, a mere bagatelle. I could\r\nhave borne that without hesitation. I have broken prison before.”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“There is more. When I escaped from the British prison-ship I was\r\npenniless; alone in England. I halted the first traveler I met, thinking\r\nto despoil the enemy for my needs as an act of war. That traveler\r\nhappened to be the Marquis du Trémigon. I met him afterward at—at places\r\nwhere they play in Paris,” I went on. “He won all my money, a ring I had\r\ntaken from him and a coin which bore certain markings. These things were\r\nproofs positive. He threatened to charge me with highway robbery. The\r\npunishment is death. I pleaded with him, promising to repay him if he\r\nwould give me time. Our minister is absent, Commodore Paul Jones not in\r\nParis. I was desperate. I loved life, Mademoiselle, for it held you as a\r\npossibility.”\r\n\r\n“But that you should come here, Monsieur? How does that——?”\r\n\r\n“Hear me, Mademoiselle. The Marquis du Trémigon has informed me of the\r\nnature of the agreement regarding your proposed marriage.”\r\n\r\n“And what did Monsieur du Trémigon say as to that?”\r\n\r\n“That by the terms of the contract three people must consent willingly\r\nbefore the marriage can take place.”\r\n\r\n“Three, Monsieur?”\r\n\r\n“He said so.”\r\n\r\n“And those are?”\r\n\r\n“Yourself, your grandfather and himself.”\r\n\r\nHer lip curled.\r\n\r\n“Proceed, Monsieur. This is most interesting.”\r\n\r\n“He said further that you were—forgive me—anxious to marry him.”\r\n\r\nI could see Mademoiselle clench her hand. I could mark the flash of her\r\neye.\r\n\r\n“That he was anxious to marry you, but that your grandfather refused\r\nhis consent. And that, with your approval, he had arranged to”—it was\r\na deeply humiliating thing to say with her standing before me like an\r\noutraged goddess, but I had to go on—“to compromise you with him so that\r\nyour grandfather would no longer withhold his consent.”\r\n\r\n“And you were to be the means whereby this plan was to be carried out?”\r\n\r\n“To my shame I admit it. I agreed to come here and take some article\r\nbelonging to you of a personal character.”\r\n\r\n“My slipper?”\r\n\r\n“That or whatever else I could secure. I wore his clothes because he\r\nwished the servants to recognize them, and thus be prepared to swear that\r\nhe was with you.”\r\n\r\n“’Tis a pretty plot for a gentleman!”\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle, to my sorrow and regret, I acknowledge it. Yet I beg to\r\nassure you that not even the fear of imprisonment or death would have\r\nmade me consent, had I not believed that I was doing a lady a service.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think you do any lady a service by forcing her into the arms of\r\nMarquis du Trémigon?”\r\n\r\n“But if she loves him?”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” she said hotly, “she hates him!”\r\n\r\n“Is it possible?”\r\n\r\n“You have been grossly deceived. The only consent necessary to the\r\nmarriage is my own. My grandfather has not withheld his consent. He has\r\nleft it entirely to me.”\r\n\r\n“You, Mademoiselle?” I exclaimed, my heart leaping at the thought that\r\nshe did not love that villain.\r\n\r\n“I have refused and shall refuse. The whole plan is an attempt to\r\ncompromise me, to force my consent.”\r\n\r\nInto what a scheme had I been betrayed! The sweat rose to my forehead.\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle,” I cried, “for God’s sake acquit me of any such dishonor!”\r\n\r\n“I do, Monsieur, freely.”\r\n\r\n“I shall go back to du Trémigon and explain my appearance to him\r\nimmediately. I shall compel him to give me satisfaction for this\r\ninsult—an insult to you as well as to me. Your quarrel with him shall be\r\nmine. He will trouble you no more,” I added significantly.\r\n\r\n“Your plan is vain, Monsieur. I know the Marquis du Trémigon. You will\r\nfind him surrounded by such a force as will paralyze your efforts. He\r\nwill refuse to fight with you.”\r\n\r\n“At least I shall have the satisfaction of telling him what I think, and\r\nI shall go to prison if necessary.”\r\n\r\n“I would not have you suffer on my account, Monsieur.”\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle, you are kindness itself. I deserve nothing whatever at\r\nyour hands. If you could only believe in me, in my love for you, a little\r\nbefore I go——”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur, the circumstances are very unusual. That day you so bravely\r\nrescued me from those scoundrels and treated me with such chivalry, I\r\nknew you were not of the common people. Your dress indicated that, but my\r\nheart—my mind, that is—told me otherwise.”\r\n\r\nHer voice faltered, but she looked at me clearly with those glorious eyes\r\nof hers.\r\n\r\n“But when I found you here and thought you meant to degrade me, to force\r\nme into the arms of that villain——”\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle!” I protested, “you cannot accuse me as I do myself. At\r\nleast I can make amends now.”\r\n\r\n“But is there nothing I can do for you?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Nothing. The papers, the obligations, the evidence against me, are in\r\nthe hands of a notary. If he does not hear from the Marquis and myself\r\ntomorrow, he has orders to hand the packet to the Chief of Police.”\r\n\r\n“What do you propose to do, sir?”\r\n\r\n“To warn you. Beware of du Trémigon. Although he has failed in this\r\ninstance, he will surely strive again to compromise your honor. There\r\nwill be one ray of comfort in my soul, that I have again been able to\r\nrender some slight assistance to you. And I cherish the hope, if you\r\nthink of me at all, that you will bear in mind that I love you.”\r\n\r\n“But, Monsieur——”\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle, if I had met you under happier circumstances, I should\r\nhave made it my prayer to live for you. Now at least I can die for you,\r\nand I trust that my death will redeem this disgrace upon my name.”\r\n\r\nI laid the little slipper softly on the table. I kissed it tenderly,\r\nreverently, before I put it down. I stepped nearer to her. She stood, as\r\nif paralyzed, gazing upon me. There was a flush in her cheeks; her bosom\r\nheaved. I sank at her feet and took her hand. It was icy cold. Mine was\r\nburning. I kissed it fervently and rose.\r\n\r\n“Farewell,” I said, and then heard sounds, footsteps in the hall, a knock\r\nat the door of the anteroom through which I had to pass in order to make\r\nmy escape.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IV\r\n\r\n                         THE SLIPPER IS BESTOWED\r\n\r\nI made a swift movement toward the door, intending to rush to the window,\r\nno matter who barred the way. I reached for my sword as I did so. Quick\r\nas I was, Mademoiselle was quicker. Although her face had gone white at\r\nthe noise, she had instantly begun to sing—strange action, for which I\r\ncould then see no excuse. Still lilting lightly a charming little air,\r\nshe stood between me and the door.\r\n\r\n“Not that way!” she whispered in the breaks of the song. “It would be\r\ndeath. In there.”\r\n\r\nShe pointed toward her bedroom. The knocking was resumed, this time more\r\nloudly. A voice cried:\r\n\r\n“Countess Gabrielle!”\r\n\r\nHer check of me had spoiled my chance. There was nothing but obedience.\r\nI slipped into the bedroom and closed the door. The song broke off\r\nsuddenly. I could hear distinctly all that was said. Mademoiselle raised\r\nher voice, crying:\r\n\r\n“Who is there?”\r\n\r\n“Your grandfather,” was the answer.\r\n\r\n“Enter, Monsieur.”\r\n\r\n“The door is locked.”\r\n\r\nHow I blessed that lock! So, I doubt not, did Mademoiselle. She went\r\nslowly to the antechamber, fumbled at the lock a few moments, and opened\r\nthe door. I heard two people enter.\r\n\r\n“Wait, Messieurs!” cried Mademoiselle as she caught sight of the second\r\nvisitor. “I was preparing to retire.” With marvelous quickness she\r\nhad taken off her bodice after I had entered the bedroom, and was\r\nbare-necked and armed before her grandfather. She hastily slipped on a\r\ndressing-robe and once more turned to him.\r\n\r\n“’Tis only Éspiau,” said the Duke quickly.\r\n\r\n“I am very glad indeed,” said Mademoiselle, with a gay little laugh, “for\r\nyou caught me quite unaware.”\r\n\r\n“Was I mistaken or was there a tremble in her voice? Her situation\r\nwas grave. Had the Duke discovered me, he would have killed me out of\r\nhand, unless I inflicted a like penalty upon him, which, under the\r\ncircumstances, never entered my mind.\r\n\r\n“I thought,” continued the old Duke as he entered the boudoir, “that I\r\nheard voices.” He looked around suspiciously.\r\n\r\n“You did, Monsieur,” answered the Countess.\r\n\r\n“Great heavens!” thought I, “are you about to betray me?”\r\n\r\n“Whose?” went on the old man again.\r\n\r\n“Mine; I was singing.”\r\n\r\nShe began that little song, the music of which I shall never forget,\r\nalthough I am no great hand at carrying a tune.\r\n\r\n“Humph!” said the old man. “You did not go to the masked ball?”\r\n\r\n“No, Monsieur, I was tired. I have been reading in the library and have\r\nbut recently come here.”\r\n\r\n“There was no one in the anteroom when you entered?”\r\n\r\n“No one, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Have you been in the room beyond since you came up?”\r\n\r\n“Not yet.”\r\n\r\n“Éspiau!”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur le Duc!”\r\n\r\n“Examine yonder chamber. It may be some thief has concealed himself\r\nthere.”\r\n\r\nThe Duke turned his head away to survey the room and Mademoiselle shot\r\none glance, pregnant with agony and entreaty, at the old servant. He had\r\nbeen as a father to her from childhood—indeed, he had been her father’s\r\nfoster-brother.\r\n\r\n“Very well, Monsieur le Duc,” answered the servant.\r\n\r\nI heard him crossing the room. What should I do? There was no place of\r\nconcealment. The window happened to be barred, else I should have thrown\r\nmyself from it. Should I fall upon him and run my sword through him? I\r\ndrew the weapon, without making a sound, and waited. The door opened\r\nslowly and only partially, Éspiau saw me at once. He put his finger to\r\nhis lips and closed his eyes.\r\n\r\n“I see no one, Monsieur le Duc,” he said, turning his head.\r\n\r\n“Examine thoroughly,” returned the old man.\r\n\r\nÉspiau stepped into the room, looked under the bed, shook the curtains,\r\nmaking a deal of noise as he moved about, managing to say to me:\r\n\r\n“Silence, as you value your life!”\r\n\r\nPresently he returned to the others. I breathed a long sigh of relief. I\r\nremember wiping the sweat from my brow.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur le Duc was doubtless mistaken,” said the old man quietly.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the Duke; “I’m glad of it. Times are in such disorder. There\r\nare many masterless men about, and your apartment is easy of access from\r\nthe garden. I must change it, Countess.”\r\n\r\n“At your pleasure, grandfather,” said Mademoiselle, and then she actually\r\nbegan to sing that little love song again. The courage of that girl was\r\nsuperb! It made me love her more madly than before.\r\n\r\n“I am glad to find you home,” said the Duke, “for I have brought you\r\nsome papers which require your signature. I intended to leave them until\r\nmorning, but unless you feel inclined to retire——”\r\n\r\n“No, Monsieur, I never felt so wide awake in my life,” answered\r\nMademoiselle.\r\n\r\n“Good! I will leave them here then. Éspiau will explain them to you, and\r\nwe can finish the discussion in the morning. I am tired and feel the need\r\nof rest. Good night.”\r\n\r\n“Good night, grandfather,” said Mademoiselle; “may you rest well.”\r\n\r\n“Good night, my child,” said the old man, relaxing for the moment the\r\nformality of his address as he took her hand, drew her toward him,\r\npressed a kiss upon her forehead, bowed to her as to a queen and walked\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThe two left within the boudoir moved not until the echo of the Duke’s\r\nfootsteps died away in the distance of the corridor.\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle,” at last began Éspiau in a voice in which sorrow and\r\naffection strove for the mastery.\r\n\r\n“Judge me not,” said Mademoiselle quickly.\r\n\r\n“Who is that man?”\r\n\r\nI thought now it was time for me to make my entrance. I opened the door,\r\ntherefore, and presented myself.\r\n\r\n“My name is Francis Burnham, my good fellow. I am an officer in the\r\nAmerican Navy.”\r\n\r\n“How came you here and what would you do?”\r\n\r\n“That scoundrel du Trémigon sent him here to compromise me,” the Countess\r\ninterposed.\r\n\r\n“The dastard!” exclaimed the servant.\r\n\r\n“But Monsieur did not think it was I,” continued Mademoiselle. “You\r\nremember when I went on that errand for Her Majesty the Queen?” I started\r\nat this. Éspiau nodded. “This gentleman had the good fortune to save me\r\nfrom capture then. I should have been robbed of those papers. I found him\r\nhere this evening. He had abjured his errand and was upon the point of\r\ndeparture when——”\r\n\r\n“My friend,” I interrupted, “what Mademoiselle says is absolutely true,\r\nand I believed, furthermore, that I was doing her a service.”\r\n\r\n“I need not your assurance for that, Monsieur,” said the old man proudly;\r\n“the house of de Rivau does not lie.”\r\n\r\n“I wish the same might be said of the house of du Trémigon; but be that\r\nas it may, I am not anxious to forfeit any man’s good-will.”\r\n\r\n“Not even that of a servant?” he interrupted.\r\n\r\n“Not even that. It was a case of life or death for me. I am in du\r\nTrémigon’s power. Not knowing that it was Mademoiselle—for I did not\r\nlearn until this evening that she was Comtesse de Villars—I came. I am\r\nsorry. I am going back to give myself up to the Marquis. You may guess\r\nwhat that will mean.” He shrugged his shoulders. “Before I go, allow me\r\nto express my gratitude for your forbearance. You have saved my life. The\r\nDuke would have killed me, for I should have made no resistance.”\r\n\r\n“It was death for me to see you there, to suspect—but Mademoiselle will\r\nforgive me——”\r\n\r\n“There is no need, my good Éspiau,” said the Countess, extending her hand.\r\n\r\nThe old man kissed it like a gentleman. Indeed, I dare say, compared\r\nto du Trémigon, and others that I had met in Paris, he was as fine a\r\ngentleman as any of them.\r\n\r\n“I should like to shake you by the hand,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur honors me,” said Éspiau.\r\n\r\nI didn’t know whether there was sarcasm in his voice or not, but we shook\r\nhands vigorously.\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle,” I continued, turning to her, “there is but one thing for\r\nme to do.”\r\n\r\n“What is that?”\r\n\r\n“To wish you farewell and to go as I came.”\r\n\r\n“Wait,” said Mademoiselle, her hand on her breast. “I have something to\r\nsay to you.”\r\n\r\n“At your service, Mademoiselle.”\r\n\r\n“Éspiau, can you trust me further?”\r\n\r\n“In everything, Mademoiselle,” said the old man.\r\n\r\nHe was a well-trained fellow, with as much tact as discretion. He bowed\r\nto me, and I swear I couldn’t help it, I returned his bow as if he had\r\nbeen an equal, and he marched out of the room as stately as a grenadier.\r\n\r\n“Is there no way,” began the Countess hastily, “for you to escape du\r\nTrémigon?”\r\n\r\n“None.”\r\n\r\n“I have money.”\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle,” I cried, “I shall take nothing from this room but the\r\nrecollection of your kindness, the consciousness of your worth, the sense\r\nof your beauty.”\r\n\r\n“But you will be imprisoned!”\r\n\r\n“I have had this hour of freedom. The rest is nothing.”\r\n\r\n“They will put you to death.”\r\n\r\n“Without you, I do not care to live.”\r\n\r\n“_Mon Dieu_, what shall I do?”\r\n\r\n“If you could say—if you could let me believe—it will be but for a short\r\ntime—that, were the circumstances other than they are, you might perhaps\r\nhave cared for me, it will lighten the hours and give me something sweet\r\nto dwell upon. It will make me indifferent to any fate.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur—I—I—” she faltered, her face aflame. She buried it in her hands.\r\n\r\nI sank on my knee and seized the hem of her gown. Then I felt her hands\r\nupon my head. I rose to my feet. I don’t know how or why, but I swept her\r\nto my breast in an embrace. Her lips met mine.\r\n\r\n“No more,” she said, pushing me away. “I have gone too far already. You\r\nmust not go to him now.”\r\n\r\n“I am in heaven already, Mademoiselle, and death cannot alter the fact\r\nthat you return my love.”\r\n\r\n“But you will not go to him?”\r\n\r\n“I must.”\r\n\r\n“No!”\r\n\r\nShe stooped, and before I knew what she was about, she took off one of\r\nher dainty slippers—warm from her little foot—and placed it in my hand.\r\n\r\n“Give that to him,” she said; “you will be free and I shall know how to\r\nprotect myself.”\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle!”\r\n\r\n“In pity leave me! Go!”\r\n\r\nI could not resist that. Besides, after a warning cough Éspiau thrust his\r\nhead through the door and said quickly:\r\n\r\n“Someone comes! You must hasten!”\r\n\r\nI kissed her hand, and with one backward glance tore myself away.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    V\r\n\r\n                         THE SLIPPER IS RETURNED\r\n\r\nTo scramble down the ivy was the work of a few seconds. The faithful\r\nBucknall was waiting. Without a word we bounded across the park and the\r\nbribed turnkey let us out. As for me I was treading on air. I had never\r\nbeen so happy since I was a boy. Never would she have given me that\r\nlittle slipper, against which my heart throbbed madly, if I had been\r\nindifferent to her. Did I intend to give it to du Trémigon? Never! I\r\nshould let him do his worst. Something would happen. I should get out of\r\nit in some way.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the inn we found our horses ready. After we were safely\r\nmounted old Bucknall broke the silence.\r\n\r\n“Did ye git it, yer honor?” asked the old sailor.\r\n\r\n“Get it, Bucknall? Do you remember me telling you of the lady whom I\r\nsaved from highwaymen on the road to Paris?”\r\n\r\nI had to tell someone. It would have killed me not to have been able\r\nto confide in a soul, and Bucknall was faithful and devoted beyond the\r\nordinary.\r\n\r\n“I remembers it well, sir.”\r\n\r\n“She was the lady in the house yonder.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t say so, sir!”\r\n\r\n“I love her, Bucknall!”\r\n\r\n“Then ye didn’t git it?” said the old salt coolly.\r\n\r\n“Get it? Of course, I got it. It’s in my waistcoat, over my heart.”\r\n\r\n“You’ll give it to the Markis?”\r\n\r\n“Never! I’ll keep it until the day of my death.”\r\n\r\n“That’s likely to be pretty soon, yer honor, if wot ye say is true.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t help that. I wouldn’t give it to that lying hound to purchase my\r\nlife. When I die I wish it buried with me.”\r\n\r\nAnd then I told him squarely what a scoundrel the Marquis was and how he\r\nhad befooled me about Mademoiselle’s desires.\r\n\r\n“Wot are ye goin’ to do, ef I might ax yer honor?”\r\n\r\n“I’m going to du Trémigon and tell him I refuse to do his bidding and let\r\nhim do his worst.”\r\n\r\n“Wot’ll he do?”\r\n\r\n“Clap me into prison, I suppose.”\r\n\r\n“Hadn’t we better cut an’ run fer it right now?”\r\n\r\n“I can’t. He has my word of honor that I would report the success or\r\nfailure of my mission.”\r\n\r\n“I guess he ain’t troublin’ hisself about honor, is he?”\r\n\r\n“I suppose not.”\r\n\r\n“W’y should you, sir?”\r\n\r\n“That’s the disadvantage a gentleman labors under in dealing with a\r\nscoundrel.”\r\n\r\n“I see. Hev ye thought that ye’ll be sarched by the police an’——?”\r\n\r\n“By Jove!” I interrupted. “That’s so.”\r\n\r\n“An’ wot ye’ve got’ll be tuk from ye?”\r\n\r\nThis was a new complication. I had no doubt in that case that the slipper\r\nwould eventually fall into the hands of du Trémigon and my sacrifice\r\nwould avail nothing. What was to be done? I could think of nothing. I\r\nhad no friends in Paris whom I could trust except this humble sailor.\r\nUnless I gave the slipper to him I should have to throw it away. In truth\r\nI should never have taken it. It was a mad impulse that possessed the\r\nCountess to give it me.\r\n\r\n“Bucknall,” I said at last, “you are right. I cannot keep this slipper.”\r\n\r\n“I think not, sir.”\r\n\r\n“There is no one that I know in Paris to whom I can intrust it but you.”\r\n\r\n“I reckon not, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Here it is,” I said. I am not ashamed to say that I kissed it before I\r\ngave it to the sailor. It was dark and he could not see, but if it had\r\nbeen broad daylight I should not have cared.\r\n\r\n“Wot am I to do with it, sir?”\r\n\r\n“I want you to do it up carefully in a package. Put the best wrappings\r\nabout it and tie it up shipshape. Leave it at the American minister’s\r\nfor Dr. Franklin when he comes back, which should be tomorrow or next\r\nday. You can get someone there to address it to my father’s plantation.”\r\n\r\nI gave him the address and made him repeat it many times until he had it\r\nletter-perfect.\r\n\r\n“Now,” I said, “you must leave me and shift for yourself. Here”—I reached\r\nmy hand in my pocket and took out the money that du Trémigon had given\r\nme. I might as well be hanged for an old sheep as a lamb, I reasoned, and\r\nI passed it all over to the faithful sailor. “You speak passable French,”\r\nI continued—he had picked up enough of the language in his Mediterranean\r\ncruises to make himself understood—“keep yourself close until you see the\r\nAmerican minister. Tell him of my plight and perhaps he may be able to do\r\nsomething. At any rate see that he forwards the package. You need not say\r\nwhat’s in it.”\r\n\r\n“What about my hoss, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Give me the rein.”\r\n\r\n“An’ I thanks God to get off’n him,” returned Bucknall, sliding to the\r\nground with great alacrity. “And, harkee, Master Burnham, ye ain’t seen\r\nthe last of me, yet, sir. I’ve got a few idees in my ol’ head, sir, an’\r\ndon’t you git ready for death too suddint like.”\r\n\r\nHe turned and was gone.\r\n\r\nA short time brought me to du Trémigon’s house. He was waiting for me,\r\nwellnigh consumed with anxiety and curiosity. I do not care to go into\r\nthe details of our interview that night. Suffice it to say, I felt\r\nentirely free to express my opinion of him and that I did so without let\r\nor hindrance. Of course, he carried out his part of the program, and at\r\ndaybreak I found myself in prison facing charges of highway robbery and\r\ndebts amounting to many thousand francs.\r\n\r\nBut I was happy. I had hope of the love of the Countess and I didn’t\r\ncare a rap for anything else. I felt that somehow, in some way, I should\r\nmanage to get out. I was the most cheerful prisoner under such a heavy\r\ncharge that ever occupied a cell.\r\n\r\nConfinement, I will admit, was a little wearing upon me. The first day\r\npassed, and then a second, without a sign from anybody. My examination\r\nwas set for the morrow. The turnkey who brought me my supper slipped me\r\na note. I was hungry enough—for the prison fare was scanty—but the note\r\nclaimed my attention. It was in a woman’s hand, of course, and could come\r\nonly from her, although it bore no crest and was not signed.\r\n\r\n        The turnkey and the under-governor of the jail are bribed.\r\n      Tonight, after supper, you will be removed to another cell.\r\n      This overlooks the street. The bars of the window have been\r\n      arranged so that they will come out at a touch. When the\r\n      clock in the nearby church strikes twelve, a messenger and\r\n      a horse will await you in the alley.\r\n\r\nThe note stopped there, and then a few words had been added apparently as\r\nan afterthought:\r\n\r\n        These presents from one who cares much what happens to you.\r\n\r\nIf you have been in a like situation you can guess what happened then.\r\nWhen I was calmer I put the note carefully in my pocket and fell to\r\nmy supper. I knew that I should need all my strength, and I was of a\r\npractical turn of mind even in the midst of my most romantic dreams. I\r\nhad scarcely finished the poor provender when the turnkey re-entered.\r\nHe was followed by a couple of other officials. The turnkey in a harsh\r\nmanner, as if to impress the others, although he winked knowingly at me,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“By the order of the commandant you are to be transferred to another\r\ncell.”\r\n\r\n“I do not wish to be transferred,” I returned hotly, to keep up the\r\ndeception; “this cell suits me very well, and I am satisfied to remain\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\n“Your wishes are not consulted in this matter,” he returned roughly.\r\n\r\n“You villain!” I cried, menacing him.\r\n\r\n“Have a care,” he answered; “if you don’t go peaceably we’ll have to take\r\nyou by force. Here, men!”\r\n\r\nHis two assistants stepped forward. I concluded that I had done enough,\r\nso, grumbling mightily, and giving evidence of my displeasure, I suffered\r\nthem to lead me to the other cell, where I was soon locked in for the\r\nnight. With what impatience I waited for the appointed hour!\r\n\r\nAt the first stroke of the bell I was at the window. The bars came out in\r\nmy hand. Someone had chiseled out the mortar and replaced it with putty.\r\nI gained the sill and dropped. It was a long fall, but I was delighted\r\nwhen I alighted upon a truss of hay, which had evidently been thrown at\r\nthe foot of the wall on purpose to receive me. I scrambled up and looked\r\nabout. A man approached me. He had a weapon. I was without arms, and\r\nalthough I stood ready to spring, I had no doubt he was a messenger.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur Burnham?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“The same.”\r\n\r\n“Come with me.”\r\n\r\nI followed him down the narrow street on tiptoe. So far as I could see it\r\nwas entirely deserted. The street opened upon a little park or square.\r\nUnder the trees I made out horses. There were three of them. A figure sat\r\nupon one. My heart leaped into my mouth as I discerned it to be a woman.\r\nOne of the horses was turned over to me. My conductor took the third,\r\nfirst handing me a hat and cloak. Then he turned and, indicating that we\r\nshould follow, made his way into the street. On account of the lateness\r\nof the hour, and the fact that the jail was in a remote and unfrequented\r\nportion of the town, the street was dark and empty. We passed a lantern\r\npresently and its rays fell upon the woman who had persistently avoided\r\nconversation with me. Under this light, although she wore a mask and was\r\nshrouded in a cloak, I knew that it was the Countess. Nothing could stop\r\nme then. I swung my horse in toward hers and laid my hand on her arm.\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle,” I said, “it is to you that I owe my freedom.”\r\n\r\n“Not yet,” she replied, but she did not shake off my hand, and we rode\r\nside by side, the horses going at a good pace.\r\n\r\n“First, you gave me something to live for—” I said.\r\n\r\n“That was?”\r\n\r\n“Yourself. Now you give me life to enjoy you.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” she said, dodging the issue, “we have but little time to\r\nconverse. I learned of your plight——”\r\n\r\n“How, Mademoiselle?”\r\n\r\n“From your servant, an ancient sailor. He followed you, learned where you\r\nwere imprisoned, and immediately sought me.”\r\n\r\n“How did he get access to you?”\r\n\r\n“He had a—talisman, Monsieur, that insured him an immediate hearing.”\r\n\r\nI was completely puzzled, but Mademoiselle gave me no time for thought.\r\nShe went on hurriedly:\r\n\r\n“I bribed the commandant and turnkey. I provided these horses. The man\r\nahead of us is——”\r\n\r\n“Éspiau!” I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Yes. He will conduct you out of France.”\r\n\r\n“And you came, Mademoiselle——??”\r\n\r\n“To say farewell.”\r\n\r\n“Never!” I cried. “I will leave France, Mademoiselle, but not alone.”\r\n\r\n“You mean?”\r\n\r\n“I take you with me.”\r\n\r\n“Impossible!”\r\n\r\n“But do you not love me?” She was silent. “Would you have done all this\r\nfor me if you had not?” I persisted.\r\n\r\n“Gratitude, Monsieur, for services rendered, and——”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense!” I said, laughing, “you know that you care. Why, I have lived\r\nin the prison upon the memory of that——”\r\n\r\n“You are cruel, Monsieur.”\r\n\r\n“Is it cruel for a man who loves a woman to take the woman, if she loves\r\nhim, away with him?”\r\n\r\nI was young and reckless. I didn’t care what happened. I swung my horse\r\nin closer to hers and slipped my arm around her. She struggled, but in\r\ndespite of her struggles I kissed her. Her head sank on my shoulder.\r\n\r\n“Don’t!” she whispered. “You are so strong. I cannot let you go——”\r\n\r\nThat was a wise pair of horses, for they stopped while I poured out\r\nmy soul to her there and then. What her answer might have been I know\r\nnot. Yet I was prepared to take her away by force when we were suddenly\r\nalarmed by Éspiau. He had ridden ahead a few paces; now he came back on\r\nthe run.\r\n\r\n“Soldiers!” he said hastily. “The King’s guard! We must flee!”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” said the Countess, quickly releasing herself and thrusting a\r\nlittle parcel into my hand, “here is the talisman. Go! unless you wish to\r\ndisgrace me. Éspiau and I will remain here.”\r\n\r\nShe had right on her side. We must not be found together. To assist in\r\nthe escape of a prisoner, charged with a capital offense, was a serious\r\nmatter. I swerved my horse and started away. But I had not gone ten paces\r\nbefore a heavy hand seized my horse’s bridle and a stern voice bade me\r\nstand in the King’s name. Lights appeared on the instant and I saw that\r\nI was surrounded. I cast one glance backward at the Countess and Éspiau.\r\nThey, too, had been arrested. It was a trap! The whole party had been\r\ncaught. Back of the men who had stopped us I noticed a single horseman.\r\n\r\n“Have you got him?” he said as he drew near.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Monsieur le Duc.”\r\n\r\nI recognized his voice. It was Mademoiselle’s grandfather!\r\n\r\n“Take him to my house,” said the old man shortly.\r\n\r\nThe next moment du Trémigon spurred through the throng. It was he who\r\nwith the remainder of the King’s guard had apprehended Mademoiselle and\r\nÉspiau. He shot one venomous glance at me, in which triumph was mingled\r\nwith hate, and approached the Duke, whispering a few words. I saw the\r\nold man start violently; a look of anger and dismay crossed his face—the\r\nMarquis spoke earnestly for a moment or two. The Duke nodded—unwillingly,\r\nI thought. The next moment he left us and rode forward with du Trémigon\r\nto the side of his granddaughter. I stared after them in despair.\r\n\r\n“Where am I to be taken?” I asked one of the officers commanding the\r\nescort that had seized me.\r\n\r\n“Back to prison.”\r\n\r\n“And not to the Duke’s house?”\r\n\r\n“An oubliette will doubtless be safer and more comfortable quarters for\r\nMonsieur,” said the captain politely, giving the order to march.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFortune had been both kind and unkind to me once more. On the whole I\r\njudged, as I lay in the darkness of the damp, wretched dungeon from\r\nwhich no escape seemed possible, that the balance was on the side of\r\nkindness. I had had a breath of fresh air. I had further evidence that\r\nthe woman I loved loved me. I had come near to freedom with her. And\r\nI had the talisman which Bucknall had shrewdly used to gain access to\r\nher. I could feel it in the darkness, for I had unwrapped it. It was the\r\nslipper—my lady’s slipper that had caused all the trouble! As I pressed\r\nit passionately to my lips I felt the crackle of paper inside. A letter!\r\nWhat would I have given for a light by which to read it!\r\n\r\nAh, yes, things looked black to me, but I blessed fortune nevertheless—on\r\nmy own account, that is. I was filled with anxiety as to what would\r\nhappen to the Countess between her grandfather and du Trémigon. There\r\nwas one other matter, which gave me grave concern. When du Trémigon\r\nrode up to the Duke he had been followed by a servant on horseback, a\r\nparticularly vicious-looking man with one eye. The light was not clear\r\nand I was not able to see distinctly. Yet I recognized him. Where I had\r\nmet him, under what circumstances, I could not at first decide, but in\r\nthe darkness of that dungeon all came back to me. He was the man whose\r\nwrist I had broken with my cudgel, when Mademoiselle had been attacked.\r\nHe was evidently the leader of that assault upon her. She had spoken of\r\nthe Queen’s despatch. Could it be that du Trémigon had instigated the\r\nattack? It must have been the case. I decided that the fact itself was of\r\ngreat importance, and that possibly I might use it in case of necessity.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   VI\r\n\r\n                        THE SLIPPER GOES TO COURT\r\n\r\nI got through the night somehow. The next morning—I knew it was morning,\r\nbecause some faint light had filtered through a slit near the roof, the\r\nmost eventful day in my life, which had not been without its surprising\r\nincidents—was ushered in by a visit from the commandant of the prison.\r\nWhy he honored me with his personal attention was not obvious, though I\r\nlearned later that it was on account of an order of the Queen. Curtly\r\nenough he bade me follow him, which I did, nothing loth. Anything was\r\nbetter than the cursed oubliette.\r\n\r\nI fancy that I must have presented rather a sorry figure, for he was\r\ngood enough to show me into a small room where there were some toilet\r\nconveniences, and I made myself as presentable as possible. Fortunately,\r\nmy clothes—I had resumed my own, when I returned to du Trémigon—were of\r\ngood material and a perfect fit, and I was rather proud of my figure,\r\ntoo. While there I read the note in the slipper. It was small, like the\r\ncontainer, but very sweet to me:\r\n\r\n        Monsieur, [it said], to see you again I come with Éspiau\r\n      tonight. I bid you an eternal farewell and write what I\r\n      dare not speak—I love you!\r\n\r\nAn eternal farewell, eh? I would have something to say about that, I was\r\nresolved.\r\n\r\nMy hat and cloak—that Mademoiselle had provided me with the night\r\nbefore—were fetched, and after a good breakfast, which seemed to have\r\nbeen brought from his own table, he conducted me to a closed carriage and\r\nI was driven a long distance through the country, arriving at last at a\r\nplace that I afterward found to be Versailles.\r\n\r\nI tried several times to converse with my guards, but neither would talk\r\nto me. I resigned myself to whatever was coming, therefore, and busied\r\nmyself with thoughts of Mademoiselle. I had been to Versailles seeking\r\nDr. Franklin, but had never seen the royal palace. Consequently I did not\r\nrecognize it when the carriage stopped and I was led forth. I supposed\r\nthat it might be one of the residences of the great Duc de Rivau-Huet.\r\n\r\nBefore I had time to speculate, however, I was blindfolded and led\r\nthrough numberless corridors, up and down flights of stairs, in rooms and\r\nout in bewildering succession. I made no resistance. It would have been\r\nuseless, and the officers who brought me thither informed me that no harm\r\nwas intended. Finally we stopped, hands fumbled at the bandage, and I\r\nopened my eyes to find myself in a magnificent apartment—an antechamber\r\nof some sort, evidently. It was void of people, save ourselves and a\r\nsentry in the uniform of the Swiss Guards at the door at the farther end.\r\n\r\nRunning my hand through my hair with the natural instinct of a young man,\r\nand shaking myself as if to free my person by the motion, at a gesture\r\nfrom my guide I stepped boldly to the door. The Swiss presented arms, the\r\nofficial tapped on the door and stepped back, a voice I recognized bade\r\nme enter, and in another moment I was in the presence of Mademoiselle.\r\nShe was standing near the door. I took one step toward her and fell on my\r\nknees, when a scandalized voice exclaimed in my ear:\r\n\r\n“Monsieur, do you not see the Queen?”\r\n\r\n“I do,” I answered, without taking my eyes off Mademoiselle, “and I kneel\r\nto her with all the homage of my heart.”\r\n\r\nMademoiselle blushed vividly and stepped aside.\r\n\r\n“She means the Queen of France, Monsieur,” she said softly.\r\n\r\nAs I knelt there, my eyes fell upon a young woman—she was only\r\ntwenty-four—seated farther off at the opposite side of the room, a\r\nbeautiful woman with a fresh, sweet, innocent face, with nothing\r\nespecially regal about her, that I could see. I knew in a moment that\r\nthis was Marie Antoinette. Such was my astonishment, however, that I\r\nremained kneeling, my mouth open, in great surprise. Her Majesty was\r\npleased to laugh. She laughed as merrily as a girl.\r\n\r\n“Make your homage to the Queen of France, Monsieur,” exclaimed the\r\nelderly woman who had spoken to me first, evidently one of the great\r\nladies of the Court.\r\n\r\n“Your Majesty,” I replied, finding my wits at last, “I knelt as every\r\ngentleman should, to the queen of his heart, and when she stepped aside\r\nand revealed to me the queen of all hearts, I was unable to rise.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps, Monsieur, you have sufficiently recovered now to approach more\r\nnearly the throne,” she said, pleased at my compliment.\r\n\r\nShe extended her hand to me. I got to my feet, knelt again before her\r\nand kissed it. Queens are always beautiful, but I swear I would rather\r\nhave kissed Mademoiselle’s hand at any hour. However, I reflected that\r\nthe honor of America was in a measure committed to me, and I think I bore\r\nmyself worthily.\r\n\r\n“Rise, Monsieur,” said the Queen graciously; “the Comtesse de Villars”—I\r\nsuppose it is bad manners to look at one woman when another woman is\r\nspeaking to you, especially if that woman be of royal blood, but I could\r\nnot help turning my head at her words.\r\n\r\nThere stood Mademoiselle more beautiful than ever. Indeed, I have\r\nobserved that she always looks better the more beautiful her background,\r\nand Marie Antoinette might be Queen of France, but she was only a\r\nbackground to Mademoiselle that morning.\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle de Villars tells me that you have rendered me a great\r\nservice.”\r\n\r\n“If to love Mademoiselle de Villars,” I began, “with all my heart and\r\nsoul, be to render Your Majesty a service——”\r\n\r\n“Nay, nay, not that way. I fear you would fain rob me of my fairest maid\r\nof honor.”\r\n\r\n“It ill becomes a gentleman to contradict a lady,” I replied quickly.\r\n\r\nAgain the Queen laughed. I was lucky evidently.\r\n\r\n“What I meant, Monsieur, was that Mademoiselle de Villars tells me that\r\nyou saved her from assault, capture, I know not what, on the highroad\r\nsome ten days ago.”\r\n\r\n“Your Majesty, I had that good fortune.”\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle de Villars was on my errand. There were papers I did\r\nnot care to intrust to any save the most intimate hand, which she was\r\nbringing back to me.”\r\n\r\n“I perfectly understand, Your Majesty.”\r\n\r\n“I will not disguise the fact that had these papers fallen into the\r\npossession of an enemy——”\r\n\r\n“The Marquis du Trémigon?” I interrupted.\r\n\r\n“Du Trémigon?” cried Mademoiselle.\r\n\r\n“Why he, Monsieur?” asked the Queen.\r\n\r\n“It was he who instigated the assault upon Mademoiselle, I am convinced.”\r\n\r\n“How know you this?”\r\n\r\n“One of the ruffians who menaced the lady was one-eyed. He wore a patch\r\nover his face. I was lucky enough to break his wrist with my cudgel.”\r\n\r\n“A strange weapon for a gentleman,” said Her Majesty.\r\n\r\n“It is honored above my sword, in that it hath served Mademoiselle,” I\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\n“You have a French twist to your tongue,” said the Queen. “Proceed.”\r\n\r\n“I recognized the man in the Marquis du Trémigon’s following last night,\r\nYour Majesty.”\r\n\r\n“I know whom he means, Madame; I saw him, too,” said Mademoiselle. “I\r\nheard Monsieur du Trémigon call him Babin. Strange to say, I did not\r\nrecognize him before.”\r\n\r\n“That agrees perfectly with my recollection, Madame. I remember that the\r\nman who ran away that day on the road called him by that name.”\r\n\r\n“And you think the Marquis du Trémigon wanted these papers?” continued\r\nthe Queen.\r\n\r\n“I am sure of it, Madame.”\r\n\r\n“But why?”\r\n\r\n“Your Majesty knows that he is a suitor for the hand of Mademoiselle de\r\nVillars. He hoped doubtless that if he could get the papers he might—”\r\nI hesitated. It was an ugly word to say, yet the Marquis du Trémigon\r\nhad shown himself to me in his true colors, and I knew there was no\r\nknavery he would stop at. “He hoped to influence you, and, through\r\nyou, Mademoiselle. By the terms of her father’s will she must consent\r\nwillingly to the marriage, else the contract is void.”\r\n\r\n“You seem to know a great deal about the affairs of Mademoiselle,\r\nMonsieur.”\r\n\r\n“I intend, with your permission, Madame, to know everything about them in\r\nthe future.”\r\n\r\nThe Queen smiled.\r\n\r\n“He is droll, this cavalier. He speaks like a Frenchman, and wooes like\r\nan American.”\r\n\r\n“Have I your permission, Madame?” asked Mademoiselle.\r\n\r\n“Certainly, my dear.”\r\n\r\n“It was the Marquis du Trémigon who betrayed us last night,” she said,\r\nturning to me.\r\n\r\n“Another score to be settled between us,” I said under my breath.\r\n\r\n“He has a creature in his pay in my grandfather’s house, and through\r\nhim he learned my plan. He laid a very clever trap. Although he could\r\nhave stopped me at any time, he allowed us to go on, that we might be\r\ncaught in the act. Now he hopes to win my grandfather’s consent to this\r\nmarriage, and perhaps by that means force it upon me.”\r\n\r\n“You shall never marry him,” I said, utterly oblivious of everything,\r\neverybody, except Mademoiselle and that fact.\r\n\r\n“And why not, pray, Monsieur?” asked the Queen.\r\n\r\n“Because, Your Majesty, I shall marry her myself.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed!”\r\n\r\n“The word of a gentleman, Madame,” I said.\r\n\r\n“But are you a gentleman?” asked Marie Antoinette. There was an accent\r\nof raillery in her voice that robbed the question of its sting. “One\r\nday you masquerade as a sailor. The next day you enter Mademoiselle’s\r\napartments”—she knew all, then!—“as a thief. Today you stand before me as\r\na criminal.”\r\n\r\n“I plead guilty to every charge, Madame. I am a sailor, I am a thief.\r\nLast night I would have stolen——”\r\n\r\n“What, Monsieur?”\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle.”\r\n\r\n“From her grandfather?”\r\n\r\n“From the throne itself, Your Majesty,” I replied fervently.\r\n\r\nAgain the Queen smiled.\r\n\r\n“Enough, Monsieur,” she said, rising; “I have exerted myself in your\r\nfavor. I had an order from the King to bring you here. I have requested\r\nthe Duc de Rivau-Huet to consign Mademoiselle to my care. I wished to\r\nthank you for the service you have done me—to ask you to wear this in\r\nmemory of my gratitude.”\r\n\r\nShe drew a rarely beautiful diamond ring from her finger and extended it\r\nto me. I kissed the hand and slipped the ring upon my little finger.\r\n\r\n“Your Majesty overwhelms me,” I said.\r\n\r\n“The reward scarcely equals your merit, Monsieur, and it does not even\r\napproach your assurance.”\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle would make a craven bold, Madame.”\r\n\r\n“Doubtless,” said the Queen. “And now we have the honor to wish you a\r\nsafe return to America.”\r\n\r\nI looked at Mademoiselle. She had turned deathly pale. Her eyes were\r\nfilled with tears. Before my glance she lowered her head. My resolution\r\nwas taken at once.\r\n\r\n“But, Your Majesty, I am not going back to America.”\r\n\r\n“How, Monsieur! You contradict the Queen?”\r\n\r\n“At least, I am not going back alone,” I added respectfully.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur, believe me,” the Queen rejoined earnestly, “it is impossible.\r\nThe Duc de Rivau-Huet would never consent. He is one of the great nobles\r\nof France. You——”\r\n\r\n“I am a criminal, Madame, and respect no conventions save those dictated\r\nby my own heart.”\r\n\r\nI could swear that Mademoiselle gave me one grateful glance.\r\n\r\n“Is that the custom of America?” asked the Queen.\r\n\r\n“Of the world, Madame. When one loves as I, there is but one custom.”\r\n\r\n“That is?”\r\n\r\n“To give oneself to one’s mistress and to take her for his own.”\r\n\r\nThe situation was becoming impossible. It was fortunately saved for me by\r\nthe entrance of an equerry.\r\n\r\n“Your Majesty”—he stopped and bowed low—“Monsieur le Marquis du Trémigon\r\nwould like the honor of an audience.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” said the Queen, turning to me, “you still persist in this mad\r\nresolution?”\r\n\r\n“Madame, I am determined in it. There is but one voice that can send me\r\nto America—alone.”\r\n\r\n“And that voice.”\r\n\r\n“Is Mademoiselle’s.”\r\n\r\n“Speak to him, Gabrielle,” said the Queen.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle turned and looked at me. Her lips formed a word; she drew\r\nher breath sharply in, but no sound came.\r\n\r\n“With reverence to Your Majesty, that word Mademoiselle cannot say.”\r\n\r\n“Why not, Monsieur?”\r\n\r\n“Because she loves me,” I answered confidently.\r\n\r\nThe Queen looked from one to the other of us. I only looked at\r\nMademoiselle. She could not sustain the concentrated force of two such\r\nstares as ours. She hid her face in her hands.\r\n\r\n“_Ma foi_,” said Marie Antoinette, with one of those quick changes of\r\nmood which made her so fascinating, “it is even so. Before two such\r\nlovers, I may be pardoned if I forget that I am a queen and remember only\r\nthat I am a woman.”\r\n\r\n“May God bless Your Majesty for that!” I cried enthusiastically. “Does it\r\nmean——?”\r\n\r\n“That I am on your side, Monsieur? Satisfy me of what has been told me of\r\nyourself this morning and we shall see.”\r\n\r\nThe look that she gave me spoke volumes. I was speechless with happiness.\r\nTo satisfy her, everyone, of my position would be easy. If only I could\r\nget word to Dr. Franklin. He had been a friend of my father in the\r\ncolonies. He knew many people I knew, and if that mad little Scotsman\r\nwere here he would be on my side. The Queen gave me no time for reply,\r\nfor she turned to the equerry and said:\r\n\r\n“I will see Monsieur du Trémigon. But wait one moment. Before he is\r\nadmitted, I wish you to go into that room, Monsieur Burnham. Leave the\r\ndoor open and stand behind the arras. You”—she turned to the elderly\r\nlady, who had discreetly withdrawn to the embrasure, and had been\r\ncarefully studying the landscape during the interview between the Queen,\r\nMademoiselle and myself—“Madame, will you ask the Duc de Rivau-Huet to\r\ncome into the small room where Monsieur Burnham goes and wait there until\r\nI call him forth? Tell him I beg him on no account to give note of his\r\npresence until he is summoned. Now”—she turned to the equerry—“bring\r\nhither the Marquis du Trémigon.”\r\n\r\nI bowed low to Her Majesty and lower to Mademoiselle, and entered the\r\napartment the Queen had indicated. The Duc de Rivau-Huet had evidently\r\nbeen waiting, for a moment later he entered under the guidance of the\r\nmessenger and stood by my side. He did not know me, of course, but we\r\nbowed to each other profoundly and then waited quietly.\r\n\r\nA moment later we heard the Queen speaking.\r\n\r\n“Monsigneur du Trémigon,” she began, “you wish to see me?”\r\n\r\n“Madame, it is the constant wish of every gentleman in France.”\r\n\r\n“Prettily said, Monsieur, and, as it happens, I also wish to see you.”\r\n\r\n“Your Majesty honors me.”\r\n\r\n“You come at an opportune time, therefore.”\r\n\r\n“Any time that I can be of service to Your Majesty is opportune,” he\r\nanswered—the clever villain had a glib tongue, as he had a fine taste in\r\nclothes, I could but admit. “I wish that Your Majesty,” he continued,\r\n“could give me back my remark.”\r\n\r\n“And what was that, Monsieur?”\r\n\r\n“That every woman in France might wish to see me.”\r\n\r\n“That would be an embarrassment of riches.”\r\n\r\n“I should be satisfied if the one nearest Your Majesty cherished that\r\ndesire.”\r\n\r\nHe shot one glance at the Countess. I could see them by moving the\r\nhangings slightly, and I didn’t scruple to look. The old Duke stood like\r\na stone, wondering why he had been brought here, and as yet unable to\r\ncomprehend the situation.\r\n\r\n“You said that you wished to see me, Monsieur?” asked the Queen,\r\ndisregarding his last remark.\r\n\r\n“My desire gives place to Your Majesty’s.”\r\n\r\n“And my will claims precedence of yours, Monsieur. Proffer your petition.”\r\n\r\n“Your Majesty, I love devotedly the Comtesse de Villars. We were\r\nbetrothed in childhood. The time for the carrying out of the contract our\r\nfathers made has arrived. I crave Your Majesty’s influence to persuade\r\nMademoiselle de Villars to honor me.”\r\n\r\nThere was a certain amount of truth in the rascal’s words. I wondered if\r\nhe really loved her a little bit, or whether it was only to get her money.\r\n\r\n“But Mademoiselle de Villars doesn’t love you, Monsieur.”\r\n\r\n“With Your Majesty’s aid I trust I shall be able to teach her to do so.”\r\n\r\n“I fear that task is beyond you or me, Monsieur du Trémigon.”\r\n\r\n“Permit me in Your Majesty’s own interest to dispute that assertion.”\r\n\r\n“How now, Gabrielle?” said the Queen, turning to Mademoiselle.\r\n\r\n“I hate him!” she cried. I could see du Trémigon wince.\r\n\r\n“You hear, Monsieur?”\r\n\r\n“I hear, Madame, but”—he tore off the disguise now and spoke with savage\r\nfirmness—“Mademoiselle must marry me.”\r\n\r\n“Must, sir! These are strange words to use to your queen.”\r\n\r\n“I speak to a woman now,” answered the Marquis.\r\n\r\n“Explain yourself.”\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle is seriously compromised.”\r\n\r\nI could see the Countess start and clench her hands. The Queen motioned\r\nher to remain silent.\r\n\r\n“How is that, Monsieur?” she asked quietly.\r\n\r\n“She received me alone in her apartments the night before last.”\r\n\r\n“You coward!” cried Mademoiselle.\r\n\r\n“Patience, Gabrielle,” said Marie Antoinette quickly. “You have proofs of\r\nthat assertion, sir?”\r\n\r\nFrom where I stood with a backward glance I could see the old Duke.\r\nHe had his hand on his sword, his face was as white as death. He was\r\nperfectly rigid. He had been told to remain where he was, however, until\r\nhe was summoned, and he would not move.\r\n\r\n“You have witnesses?” continued the Queen.\r\n\r\n“I have. I was seen to go through the gate at eleven o’clock. I climbed\r\nto Mademoiselle’s window by the ivy. I remained in her apartment one\r\nhour. It was this suit that I now wear in which I presented myself to\r\nMademoiselle.” He turned swiftly to the Countess. “Does not Mademoiselle\r\nrecognize it?” he said, with a triumphant leer.\r\n\r\nShe shuddered away from him. And indeed it was the one I had worn!\r\n\r\n“You do recognize it, Gabrielle?” asked the Queen. Mademoiselle said\r\nnothing, but it was quite evident that she did.\r\n\r\n“Your story,” said the Queen composedly, turning to the Marquis, “is most\r\ninteresting, Monsieur, if it could be believed.”\r\n\r\n“Out of consideration to one of your maids of honor”—I could have killed\r\nhim at the hateful emphasis he laid on that last word—“I hope I may be\r\nspared the pain of public testimony.”\r\n\r\n“You give me your word of honor that three nights ago you were in\r\nMademoiselle’s apartments?”\r\n\r\n“I do.”\r\n\r\n“Your word of honor as a gentleman?”\r\n\r\n“Your Majesty has said it.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, this is infamous—infamous!” cried Mademoiselle.\r\n\r\n“And you, Countess, what do you say?” continued the Queen.\r\n\r\n“It is a falsehood, a dastardly falsehood!”\r\n\r\nA look of relief swept over the old Duke’s face then. His apprehension\r\ngave place to a growing anger. I could realize how hard it was for him to\r\nremain quiet beyond that curtain. As for me I would have given everything\r\non earth to go out and kill du Trémigon.\r\n\r\n“You do not wish to marry this man—pardon, this gentleman—Gabrielle?”\r\nasked Marie Antoinette.\r\n\r\n“I would rather kill myself!”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur du Trémigon,” said the Queen, “have mercy!”\r\n\r\n“Madame, love has no mercy. I am passionately devoted to Mademoiselle.”\r\n\r\n“And is that why,” asked Marie Antoinette, with a swift change of\r\nmanner, “that you set your man, Babin, and two other ruffians to attack\r\nMademoiselle on the road to Paris ten days ago?”\r\n\r\nShe drove her queries home with the directness of sword-thrusts. The\r\nMarquis gasped, fell back, utterly dismayed. He moistened his lips and\r\nstrove to speak.\r\n\r\n“I—I—I do not know what Your Majesty means—” he faltered. “I had a\r\nservant called Babin in my employ, but I have discharged him.”\r\n\r\n“You did not know,” said the Queen pitilessly, “that Mademoiselle was\r\ncarrying papers of infinite concern to me? Relying on your sense of\r\nhonor”—she smiled mockingly—“I tell you the truth. They were letters that\r\nI had written years ago—silly, foolish letters, which yet might have\r\ngiven me trouble. Mademoiselle volunteered to get them and bring them to\r\nme. And you, Monsieur du Trémigon, having learned this in some way—oh, I\r\nhave fathomed the whole procedure,” she went on, rising and confronting\r\nhim. “You thought to get me in your power and force a consent from\r\nMademoiselle through her love for me!”\r\n\r\n“Madame, I am innocent. I know no more about this than you have told me.\r\nBabin has not been in my service for months. I know nothing about the\r\nletters.”\r\n\r\n“Do you swear it?”\r\n\r\n“I swear it!”\r\n\r\nThe Queen struck a bell on the table at my side. The equerry presented\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n“Is Monsieur Éspiau there?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Your Majesty.”\r\n\r\n“Admit him.”\r\n\r\nIn another moment the old servant of the Duke entered and fell on his\r\nknees before the Queen.\r\n\r\n“Rise, my friend,” she said, with that gentle grace, that benignity, that\r\nought to have endeared her to the whole of France, high and low, rich and\r\npoor; “were you at the Hôtel de Rivau-Huet on last Wednesday night?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Your Majesty.”\r\n\r\n“Were you in the apartments of the Comtesse de Villars?”\r\n\r\n“I was, Your Majesty.”\r\n\r\n“Between the hours of eleven and twelve?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Your Majesty.”\r\n\r\n“Was the Marquis du Trémigon there?”\r\n\r\n“No, Your Majesty.”\r\n\r\n“And you would believe a servant’s word before mine?” said du Trémigon\r\nfuriously.\r\n\r\n“We shall see. Call Monsieur Burnham,” she said to the attendant.\r\n\r\nI did not wait to be called. I was through the door in an instant. Du\r\nTrémigon started with additional surprise when he saw me.\r\n\r\n“What do you know of this charge of the Marquis du Trémigon?” asked the\r\nQueen after I had saluted her.\r\n\r\n“Your Majesty, I know that the Marquis du Trémigon was in his hôtel\r\nbetween the hours of eight in the evening and one in the morning. By\r\nno possibility could he have been in the apartment of Mademoiselle de\r\nVillars. Furthermore, the man Babin was in his employ yesterday.”\r\n\r\n“You hound!” cried du Trémigon, and then I stepped close to him. He\r\nshrank back. I stepped nearer. The Queen might have interfered, but I\r\nrather think she enjoyed it.\r\n\r\n“You know,” I said, frowning at him, “that you were not in the apartments\r\nof the Comtesse de Villars on that evening or any other evening.” He\r\nopened his mouth as if to speak. “Not a word or I’ll kill you where you\r\nstand!”\r\n\r\n“Your Majesty,” he cried, dexterously avoiding me, “will you condemn me\r\non the words of a lackey and a criminal?”\r\n\r\nI started toward him again, but the Queen raised her hand. She looked at\r\nthe equerry again, an old and trusted attendant, upon whom she could rely.\r\n\r\n“The Duc de Rivau-Huet”—she pointed to the door—“bring him here.”\r\n\r\nThe Duke was almost as quick as I. The curtain was torn aside and he came\r\nin erect, with his hand on his sword.\r\n\r\n“Your Majesty.” He bowed low before her, a graceful and gallant old\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur le Duc,” said the Queen, extending her hand to be kissed,\r\n“you are ever welcome. As the head of the house to which the Marquis du\r\nTrémigon belongs. I wish you to hear his charges and his denials, that\r\nyou may judge him accordingly.”\r\n\r\n“I have heard, Your Majesty,” said the Duke, “and give me leave to say I\r\nneed neither the evidence of Éspiau nor of this gentleman—whoever he may\r\nbe—to convince me that the Marquis du Trémigon has lied.”\r\n\r\n“And I tell you,” burst out the Marquis, “that this man is a common\r\nthief, a highway robber and—” He pointed to me.\r\n\r\n“Have a care, Monsieur,” said Marie Antoinette quickly; “highway robbery\r\nis a grave accusation. Was it on the road to Paris that he committed this\r\nhighway robbery? This is a most serious indictment. Look again. Think! Do\r\nyou press the charge? Do you really mean it?”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   VII\r\n\r\n                      THE SLIPPER FINDS ITS WEARER\r\n\r\n“His Majesty the King!” cried an usher at the great door, throwing it\r\nopen. “His Excellency, the Minister of the United States, Dr. Franklin,\r\nCommodore John Paul Jones, Monsieur Bucknall, sailor,” he added.\r\n\r\nInto the room came the King of France, a stout, heavy-set, rather\r\nstupid-looking young man. Following him I saw the familiar figure—I had\r\nseen many portraits of him in public print—of Dr. Benjamin Franklin. By\r\nhis side—and it was a good sight for any eyes—walked the handsome little\r\ndaredevil of a Scotsman in his naval uniform, looking as cocky as if he\r\nhad been strutting on his own quarter-deck. And then—did my eyes deceive\r\nme?—came the rolling form of worthy Master Bucknall. I blessed that man\r\nin my heart. He had brought Mademoiselle to my assistance in the prison\r\nand now he had completed his work by looking up Dr. Franklin and the\r\nrest. Where he had found the Commodore I did not know.\r\n\r\nI had heard he had recently arrived at L’Orient, but not that he had come\r\nto Paris.\r\n\r\n“Madame,” said the King, approaching the Queen who courtesied deeply\r\nbefore him, “I wish you good morning. Ah, Duke, I am always glad to see\r\nyou. Mademoiselle de Villars, you are fit to stand before Her Majesty,\r\nand I could pay you no higher compliment.”\r\n\r\nI was amazed to hear this fat, commonplace, prosy-looking man speak so\r\npleasantly, but in sooth Mademoiselle, with her cheeks flushed, a little\r\nsparkle of tears in her eyes, her head thrown back—well, any man of taste\r\nwould have recognized which was Queen of Love and Beauty in that room.\r\nThe King bowed shortly and coldly to du Trémigon and looked with some\r\ninterest at me.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” said the Queen to her husband, “will you allow me to present\r\nto you Monsieur Burnham, an American naval officer?”\r\n\r\nI bowed low before the King. France was our ally and we hoped much from\r\nher, and although we in America had cut kings and queens out of our\r\nbooks, I felt it necessary for me to be politic.\r\n\r\n“Dr. Franklin, you are always welcome,” continued the Queen, “even though\r\nyou do come garbed in sober gray to our gay Court.”\r\n\r\n“Your Majesty,” returned the old Quaker gallantly, “I wear gray that it\r\nmay contrast the better with the high color of my admiration for the\r\nQueen of France.”\r\n\r\n“And this is our old friend, the Commodore. We are glad to have you back\r\nat Versailles after your splendid fighting, Monsieur,” said the Queen,\r\ndimpling with pleasure at Dr. Franklin’s compliment and giving her hand\r\nto Paul Jones, who had waited with ill-concealed impatience for this\r\nrecognition of his rank and station.\r\n\r\n“To see you again, Your Majesty,” began the doughty little Captain, with\r\na shade too much fervor, I thought, “is better fortune than to capture a\r\nship like the _Serapis_.”\r\n\r\n“You must tell me about that action, Monsieur.”\r\n\r\n“I shall be pleased to attend upon Your Majesty at any time for that or\r\nany other purpose,” he replied. “And if it were necessary to secure\r\nentrance to your levee, _I_ would cheerfully engage to capture another\r\nBritish frigate.”\r\n\r\nThe Queen laughed kindly at the little Captain, and then she stared\r\ntoward Bucknall, who stood shifting from one foot to another, twisting\r\nhis hat in his hand. She was a good-hearted woman and would fain neglect\r\nno one—not even the humblest.\r\n\r\n“And who is this?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Madame, give me leave,” I interposed. “He is a sailor to whom I owe\r\nlife, liberty and—love!”\r\n\r\n“Looks he not like a cupid’s messenger?” queried Her Majesty, smiling,\r\nand then the King broke in.\r\n\r\n“Have you sent for the prisoner, Madame?”\r\n\r\n“Your Majesty, he is here?”\r\n\r\n“What, this gentleman?”\r\n\r\nThe Queen bowed.\r\n\r\n“What have you to say for yourself, sir?” the King asked me.\r\n\r\n“Much, Your Majesty. I am an American naval officer, as Commodore Paul\r\nJones can bear witness.”\r\n\r\n“’Tis true, Your Majesty. He sailed with me on the _Alfred_, and a better\r\nofficer I did not have, and I say it who have a right to testify.”\r\n\r\n“Good,” said the King. “Proceed, Monsieur.”\r\n\r\n“I was captured with Captain Cunningham in the _Revenge_.”\r\n\r\n“Give me a fleet, Your Majesty,” interrupted Commodore Jones, “and we’ll\r\nstop all that.”\r\n\r\nThe King smiled and nodded to me.\r\n\r\n“I escaped from a British prison-ship, robbed a gentleman in England, got\r\nmoney from him, came to France hoping to find Dr. Franklin or Commodore\r\nJones. Neither was in Paris. I lost my money, fell into the hands of an\r\nenemy, and was lodged in jail, whence I have been this morning brought\r\nhere by Her Majesty’s gracious interference.”\r\n\r\n“How did you lose your money?” asked the King, quite as a father might\r\nhave spoken to his son. There was something pleasant about the plain,\r\nhomely man. I hesitated not a moment.\r\n\r\n“I am sorry to say, Sire, that I gambled it away.”\r\n\r\nThe King shook his head.\r\n\r\n“I can make good your loss,” he said; “but play is the curse of the young\r\nnobles of my Court, and of all strangers who come to Paris, as well.”\r\n\r\n“Your Majesty is most kind. When I can hear from America I shall be able\r\nto discharge all my obligations, and I wish to say to Your Majesty and\r\nbefore you all”—all meant Mademoiselle—“that I shall eschew play in the\r\nfuture.”\r\n\r\n“There were charges against you of highway robbery, I believe?”\r\n\r\n“On information laid by me, Your Majesty,” broke in du Trémigon.\r\n\r\n“But Monsieur du Trémigon withdraws the charges now. Highway robbery! It\r\nhath an ugly sound,” said the Queen. “How is that, Monsieur du Trémigon?”\r\n\r\nI never saw such a look of baffled rage and hatred as that on du\r\nTrémigon’s face. He was completely powerless. The evidence against him\r\nwas too strong. He tried to speak, but there was no help for it. He bowed\r\nat last.\r\n\r\n“I am too much of a gentleman”—I have always been suspicious of a man who\r\nprotests his quality overmuch, by the way—“to contradict the Queen of\r\nFrance.”\r\n\r\n“Good,” said the King. “But there were some papers?”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur du Trémigon lost them, unfortunately,” again interposed the\r\nQueen.\r\n\r\n“Very careless, I’m sure,” commented the King severely.\r\n\r\n“I,” volunteered Dr. Franklin, “will be surety for Monsieur Burnham’s\r\ndebts to the Marquis du Trémigon.”\r\n\r\n“The word of a gentleman so vouched for is sufficient,” said the Marquis,\r\nraging in his heart, but helpless.\r\n\r\n“I’d rather pay him the money, doctor, and owe it to you,” I said softly\r\nto Dr. Franklin.\r\n\r\n“Is it a great sum, lad?” whispered the Quaker aside. “Our exchequer is\r\nrunning low. And, hark ye, that highway robbery in England. ’Tis hardly a\r\ncrime of which you could be convicted in France.”\r\n\r\nNow, why had neither I nor anyone else thought of that!\r\n\r\n“We will attend to the debt,” said the King, after a momentary\r\nconsultation with the Queen. “Now, gentlemen, no more of this.”\r\n\r\nOf course when he put on his royal look and said that, there was nothing\r\nmore for me to do.\r\n\r\n“Pardon, Your Majesty,” said the Duc de Rivau-Huet, who had noted all\r\nthat had occurred with ill-concealed impatience. “Monsieur du Trémigon\r\nhas another announcement to make.”\r\n\r\n“What is that, Duke?” asked the King.\r\n\r\n“Your Majesty is doubtless aware that my son and the father of the\r\nMarquis du Trémigon entered into a contract that their children should be\r\nmarried at a suitable age, provided they were both willing to carry out\r\nthe agreement?”\r\n\r\n“I have heard so,” answered the King.\r\n\r\n“The Marquis du Trémigon wishes, in the presence of these witnesses, to\r\nrenounce all pretension to the hand of Mademoiselle de Villars.”\r\n\r\n“Your Majesty,” protested the Marquis in one last desperate attempt to\r\ngain his end, “Monsieur le Duc mis——”\r\n\r\n“I believe I am not mistaken, Monsieur,” said the Duke, very stately and\r\nmagnificent, with his hand on his sword—my heart went out to him—looking\r\nhard at the Marquis.\r\n\r\n“I am sure,” added the Queen in her silvery voice—and you would have\r\nthought she were conferring the greatest favor in her power upon the\r\nwretched du Trémigon—“that the Duke is right. Monsieur du Trémigon,” she\r\nwent on, with a woman’s spitefulness—but indeed I could not blame her,\r\n“is no more desirous of marrying Mademoiselle de Villars than he is of\r\npressing the charge of highway robbery against Monsieur Burnham.”\r\n\r\nDu Trémigon could not trust himself to speak again. He clenched his hands\r\nand bowed low before the Queen.\r\n\r\n“Furthermore,” continued the Duke imperturbably, “Monsieur du Trémigon\r\nwishes Your Majesty’s permission to withdraw from Paris and retire to his\r\nestates.”\r\n\r\n“As the Marquis pleases,” said the King indifferently.\r\n\r\nHad I been King I should have been consumed with curiosity to know what\r\nthis was all about, but His Majesty cared little about it, apparently,\r\nfor after turning his back on du Trémigon, who backed out of the room, he\r\nsaid to Dr. Franklin:\r\n\r\n“Now that we have settled this affair, doctor, I want you to look at a\r\nlock in my cabinet that interests me greatly. Gamain brought it today.\r\nIts mechanism is curious and complex. It will interest a scientific man\r\nlike yourself, I am sure.”\r\n\r\n“I shall be glad to attend Your Majesty.”\r\n\r\n“Give me leave, Sire,” again said the Duc de Rivau-Huet. “Your Majesty,”\r\ncontinued the old man, standing very erect, “the Marquis du Trémigon\r\naverred that he was in my granddaughter’s apartments until a late hour\r\nthe other night.”\r\n\r\n“It is false,” said the Queen.\r\n\r\n“Madame, I know that. What I wish to know is, who was there?”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur! Before them all!” exclaimed Mademoiselle, startled beyond\r\nmeasure by this surprising development. This unlucky speech in itself was\r\na confession.\r\n\r\n“The King is the fountain of nobility in the land,” continued the Duke,\r\nstriving to regain his composure. “You are a maid of honor to the Queen,\r\nMademoiselle. That gentleman”—he pointed to me—“heard the accusation\r\nand denied it. These are his friends. Here is some mystery. I wish an\r\nexplanation.”\r\n\r\n“But, Duke—” began the King, with a puzzled look.\r\n\r\n“I crave Your Majesty’s pardon. Even royalty may give place to the\r\nfeelings of a grandsire. Will you allow me to conduct this affair in my\r\nown way?”\r\n\r\n“Go on,” said the King.\r\n\r\n“I am satisfied that the Marquis du Trémigon, whom I shall see later,\r\nwith the King’s permission——”\r\n\r\n“I will give you a _lettre de cachet_ to the Bastile for him, if you\r\nlike.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, Sire. Monsieur du Trémigon was not there, but I insist\r\nsomeone was, and I demand to know who.”\r\n\r\nNo one spoke for a moment.\r\n\r\n“Éspiau, you know?”\r\n\r\n“I have nothing to say, Monsieur le Duc,” replied the old servant,\r\nturning pale.\r\n\r\n“Will no one tell me?” cried the old man, grief in his heart, appeal in\r\nhis tones, shame in his bearing.\r\n\r\n“I will,” I said boldly; “I was there.”\r\n\r\n“You, sir!”\r\n\r\n“Even I, Monsieur.”\r\n\r\n“How dared you? What do you mean?” He put his hand to his heart. I\r\nwas nearest him. I stretched out my arm to help him, but he thrust me\r\naway. “Answer!” he cried, imperiously forgetful of the King, the Queen,\r\neverybody.\r\n\r\n“It is very simple,” I replied quietly. “On my approach to Paris I had\r\nthe good fortune to be of assistance to Mademoiselle.”\r\n\r\n“In what capacity?”\r\n\r\n“She was set upon by three ruffians. I drove them off.”\r\n\r\n“Whereabouts?”\r\n\r\nI was ignorant of the road, but Mademoiselle came to my rescue.\r\n\r\n“Near Paris, on the Versailles road, Monsieur.”\r\n\r\n“Where was your escort?” queried the Duke.\r\n\r\n“I was alone.”\r\n\r\n“Alone on the Versailles road?”\r\n\r\n“In my service, Duke,” said the Queen softly.\r\n\r\n“Pardon, Your Majesty. That is sufficient. Proceed, Monsieur.”\r\n\r\n“I fell in love with your granddaughter.”\r\n\r\n“How dared you, sir; a beggarly——?”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur Burnham’s patrimony includes rich land enough to make a county\r\nin France,” deftly put in Dr. Franklin at this juncture.\r\n\r\n“But in America—” said the Duke scornfully.\r\n\r\n“The finest land the sun ever set on, Monsieur,” broke in Commodore Jones\r\nhotly.\r\n\r\nThe King waved his hand for silence, and the Duke turned to me again.\r\n\r\n“I sought your granddaughter far and wide, and at last found her at the\r\nHôtel de Rivau-Huet.”\r\n\r\nI had a hard task to keep to the truth and yet make a satisfactory story.\r\n\r\n“And was it at her invitation you entered her apartment?”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur le Duc!” exclaimed the King hastily, in warning.\r\n\r\n“Grandfather!” cried the girl, recoiling from the outrageous accusation.\r\n\r\n“Sir!” I replied, with spirit, “the question is an insult to your blood!\r\nI came unexpectedly, unknown, unwelcome—like a thief in the night.”\r\n\r\n“You dared——?”\r\n\r\n“It was a prank, a foolish trick; I have no excuse but my passion.”\r\n\r\n“And you were alone with my granddaughter?”\r\n\r\n“I was there, Monsieur le Duc,” said Éspiau.\r\n\r\n“Then tell me the truth now, unless you forget your ancient fidelity,”\r\nexclaimed the Duke, turning to the unhappy servant. “You saw this\r\ngentleman there?”\r\n\r\nI shook my head at him, but he was looking at Mademoiselle. Disregarding\r\nmy warning glance, she nodded. The seal upon the servant’s lips was\r\nbroken.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Monsieur le Duc,” he said.\r\n\r\n“And where was he?”\r\n\r\n“In Mademoiselle’s—” he hesitated.\r\n\r\n“Speak!” thundered the old man.\r\n\r\n“Bedchamber, Monsieur.”\r\n\r\n“_Mon Dieu!_” cried the Duke, his composure giving way at last. He\r\nput his face in his hands with a movement singularly like that of\r\nMademoiselle a short time before.\r\n\r\nIs it that Master Shakespeare in great crises voices the universal cry\r\nof the human heart? For like the father of Hero in “Much Ado About\r\nNothing”—and indeed the whole affair was somewhat similar in my mind—the\r\nDuke finally broke forth:\r\n\r\n“‘Hath no man here a sword for me?’”\r\n\r\nI have not the sentence exactly, but I give the sense of it, and I pitied\r\nhim from the bottom of my heart. But the love of the young is often cruel\r\nto the old.\r\n\r\n“My grandfather! my grandfather!” cried Mademoiselle, sinking to his\r\nfeet, “think not bitterly of me! This gentleman has told the truth. I had\r\nbut spoken a few words to him when you came. He did me a great service. I\r\nconcealed him.”\r\n\r\n“Why?” groaned the Duke.\r\n\r\n“I was afraid that you would kill him.”\r\n\r\n“Afraid? What is he to you?”\r\n\r\nIt was a dreadful situation for a young girl. She had never told me in\r\nso many words, although I was sure of it in my own mind, and to have to\r\ndeclare it before all these men was indeed hard. Yet with a heroism for\r\nwhich I can never be sufficiently grateful she said it.\r\n\r\n“I love him!”\r\n\r\n“You love him!” exclaimed her grandfather in amazement.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur le Duc de Rivau-Huet,” I cried in my turn, springing to her\r\nside, lifting her up, and slipping my arm about her waist, “I have the\r\nhonor to ask you to give me the hand of your granddaughter in marriage.”\r\n\r\n“She is a countess of France,” replied the Duke. “The best blood in the\r\nland flows in her veins, Monsieur.”\r\n\r\n“I have some indifferent good in my own veins, Monsieur le Duc,” I\r\nasserted, naming some of my mother’s people.\r\n\r\n“Is this true, Monsieur?”\r\n\r\n“I vouch for it,” said Paul Jones.\r\n\r\n“Your Majesty,” said the Duke, turning to the King, but he got no help\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n“If you will give your consent, Duke,” said Louis, “I shall not withhold\r\nmine. Indeed, under the circumstances—”He paused significantly.\r\n\r\nThe Duke groaned and the gracious Queen came to our rescue again.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur le Duc,” she said, stepping near him and laying her hand on his\r\narm, “think! Monsieur Burnham is a gallant gentleman. As good blood as\r\nany in France flows in his veins. In America they have no kings, but they\r\nare all princes. His Majesty in his kindness consents. This will cement\r\nthe union between the two countries against England, which is so dear to\r\nthink of. Will you sacrifice your pride if I ask you, and bless the pair\r\nwho love each other?”\r\n\r\n“Madame, it is as you will,” he faltered. “I had cherished other dreams.\r\nStill, there can be no higher degree than that of gentleman, after all.\r\nNo, though he sit upon a throne.”\r\n\r\n“The royalty of virtue, the royalty of honor, the royalty of courage,”\r\nsaid Dr. Franklin kindly, “make this marriage not an unequal one.”\r\n\r\n“I am an old man,” continued the Duke; “this has been hard on me. Let the\r\nyoung love have its way.”\r\n\r\n“And you will forgive me?” pleaded Mademoiselle, approaching him nearer.\r\n\r\n“Your Majesty will permit me?” asked the Duke. He took her in his arms\r\nand pressed a kiss upon her forehead and blessed her.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” he said, turning to me and bowing, “I hope to know more of you\r\nbefore I commit this child to your keeping.”\r\n\r\n“Now that all is settled for the second time,” said the King, greatly\r\nrelieved. “Dr. Franklin, Commodore, and you, Duke, will you come with me?”\r\n\r\n“We attend Your Majesty.”\r\n\r\nThe four gentlemen bowed low before the Queen. The King bowed to me, Dr.\r\nFranklin and Commodore Jones shook my hand. Our kindly minister made an\r\nappointment to meet me later in the palace.\r\n\r\n“You were lucky,” he said.\r\n\r\nIndeed I realized that, for I replied: “Thanks to you and the Commodore.”\r\n\r\n“Nay,” said the Quaker, smiling, “thanks to Mademoiselle herself, and to\r\nyour own ready wit.”\r\n\r\nThen they left us alone with the Queen and Bucknall.\r\n\r\n“It strikes me,” said Her Majesty, looking at the old sailor, “that\r\nnobody has said anything about the part you have played in this affair.”\r\n\r\n“Aye, aye, mum,” began the sailor in great confusion, “w’ich I means yer\r\nhonor——”\r\n\r\n“‘Mum’ is delightful,” laughed Marie Antoinette.\r\n\r\n“I was at me wit’s end wot course to lay this mornin’, an’ w’en as luck\r\nwould hev it I run into Commodore Jones in the street, jist in from\r\nL’Orient—he never forgits a shipmate, ma’am, no matter how humble—an’ I\r\nups an’ told him about Mr. Burnham. He fetched me to Dr. Franklin, an’\r\nyou knows the rest, Yer Ladyship.”\r\n\r\n“I shall not forget you,” said the Queen, lifting a well-filled purse\r\nfrom the table and putting it in Bucknall’s hand. The old sailor was not\r\nwithout a streak of gallantry.\r\n\r\n“It’s the hand wot gives it, lady,” he said, “wot makes me wally it\r\nmore’n the gold pieces.”\r\n\r\n“You will await Monsieur Burnham without the door,” she said, dismissing\r\nhim graciously.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur Burnham,” she began as we three were alone, “you are a thief\r\nafter all. You have stolen the fairest jewel of my Court. I ought to be\r\nangry with you, but—I am not.”\r\n\r\n“I thank Your Majesty.”\r\n\r\n“You will be very good to this daughter of France in your own land?”\r\n\r\n“Madame, I will cherish her as the King his crown. Nay,” I added quickly,\r\n“as I would cherish Your Majesty were I the King.”\r\n\r\n“You pay me in pretty speeches.”\r\n\r\n“They come, Madame, from my heart of hearts. After my country and my\r\nwife, my sword is yours.”\r\n\r\nShe was gone. Of course I took Mademoiselle in my arms, and this time\r\nthere was no hesitation on her part in returning my ardent caresses. I\r\ndo not know what we said or what happened. After a space—how long or how\r\nshort I cannot tell, for I took no notice of time or place—I said that\r\nwhile we each had the gold pieces I regretted that I had no ring to slip\r\non her finger, nothing of my own to give her to bind the engagement. Of\r\ncourse I could not give her the Queen’s diamond—yet! She was very close\r\nto me and doubtless could feel what was in my breast-pocket.\r\n\r\n“You have one thing,” she replied demurely, “that you could slip on.”\r\n\r\n“What is that?”\r\n\r\n“Have you forgotten the talisman?”\r\n\r\n“The talisman?” I cried.\r\n\r\nI am stupid sometimes, not often, and I was thinking so hard of her that\r\nI did not catch her meaning at first.\r\n\r\n“That which Master Bucknall brought you—that I gave back to you.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said I; “the slipper saved my life; it gave me hope.”\r\n\r\n“And hope gave you assurance?”\r\n\r\n“And assurance won me you.”\r\n\r\nShe drew herself away and sat down in the Queen’s chair, and no royal\r\nperson ever became it so well as she. Then she fumbled at her shoe a\r\nmoment, and thrust out one dainty stockinged little foot at me.\r\n\r\n“You might put it on,” she whispered, blushing vividly.\r\n\r\nI am not ashamed to say that I kissed that foot before I covered it with\r\nmy lady’s slipper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _Populism_\r\n\r\n                         BY CHARLES Q. DE FRANCE\r\n              _Secretary People’s Party National Committee_\r\n\r\n\r\nPopulism is a term at which many eminently respectable but sadly\r\nmisinformed persons shy, like the staid old farm horse when he first\r\nencounters an automobile on the road to town. They regard it as\r\nsynonymous with Socialism, anarchy, bomb-throwing, nihilism and half a\r\ndozen other real or fancied evils. That it is simply a short expression\r\nfor progressive, radical or Jeffersonian Democracy has never occurred to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nPopulism is a term which well illustrates the growth of language, the\r\nevolution by which circumlocution is avoided and clearness of expression\r\nattained. Yet, at the same time, it is an apt illustration of the power\r\nof a subsidized press to create an erroneous public opinion.\r\n\r\nBack in the early ’90s, when the People’s Party was being organized in\r\na number of Western States, there was considerable discussion as to\r\nwhether it should be regarded as a political organization on the usual\r\nlines, or whether it should be a sort of league of independent voters,\r\nfree to choose and vote for such candidates, on any ticket, as might seem\r\nbest fitted to represent the interests of the different organizations of\r\nfarmers and wage-workers out of which the People’s Party finally evolved.\r\n\r\nThe Omaha National Convention in 1892 settled the question in favor\r\nof regular party organization. It is true that there were intended\r\nto be points of difference between the People’s Party machinery and\r\nthat of either old party; but these points were minor rather than\r\nfundamental. The delegate convention was retained—which, to my mind, was\r\nthe one mistake made at Omaha. Until some system of direct nominations\r\nis adopted, whereby every elector may have a vote direct—and not by\r\ndelegate, who may misrepresent him—I fear that as our party grows in\r\nstrength we shall more and more be called upon to combat the same\r\ninfluences which dominate both the old parties. However, this is\r\ndigression.\r\n\r\nWith the advent of the People’s Party a difficulty was found in\r\ndescribing a member of that party. A member of the Republican Party is,\r\nof course, a Republican; and a member of the Democratic Party is called a\r\nDemocrat—but how designate one affiliated with the People’s Party?\r\n\r\nThe omnipresent and omniscient newspaper reporter, as usual, solved the\r\ndifficulty. His agnosticism applies to nothing except the word “fail.”\r\nAnd with him circumlocution and criminality are almost synonymous.\r\nIt would never do to be ringing the changes on “an adherent to the\r\nPeople’s Party,” or “one affiliated with the People’s Party”; hence, it\r\nwas not long before we began to see the word “Populist” used in verbal\r\ndescriptions of what the cartoonist invariably depicted as a “one-gallus”\r\nman, armed with fork or rake, and blessed with a hirsute adornment truly\r\nSamsonian.\r\n\r\nApplied as a term of reproach, yet responding to the inexorable law which\r\ncompels men to follow along the lines of least resistance, the word\r\n“Populist” came to stay. It stuck, just as the term “Methodist” did—or\r\n“Christian,” for that matter. From “Populist,” descriptive of the man,\r\nto “Populism,” designating his political belief, was an easy step—and\r\nnow, after fifteen years of abuse, ridicule, vituperation and gross\r\nmisrepresentation, the great middle class is just beginning to get a\r\nclearer view and to discover that Populism is the only logical answer to\r\nthe question, “What shall we do to be saved from economic ruin?”\r\n\r\nPopulism is neither Socialism nor anarchism. It is neither idealistic\r\nnor materialistic. It is neither collectivistic nor individualistic. It\r\nis essentially eclectic. It recognizes the good in all the schools of\r\npolitical and economic thought and attempts to eliminate the weak or\r\nbad—but refuses to be bound by any.\r\n\r\nPopulism recognizes the fact that we must work with the world as it\r\nis now—and not as some Utopian dreamer conceives it ought to be. It\r\nrecognizes the fact that private ownership of productive property is not\r\nonly the rule all over the world—but also that the people like it. It\r\nrecognizes the Socialists’ “economic determinism”—that man’s economic\r\nneeds usually dominate when they clash with his ideals—yet is not\r\nunmindful of the fact that all progress is the result of ideals forcing a\r\nchange in the environment. Were it not so, man would still be an arboreal\r\nape, chattering aloft in some palm tree.\r\n\r\nPopulism recognizes that man is a social animal, yet combats Socialism\r\nfor subordinating the individual to the collectivity, and combats anarchy\r\nfor subordinating the collectivity to the individual. It is the golden\r\nmean between these extremes.\r\n\r\nAlthough Populism lays no claim to being either a “science” or a\r\n“philosophy,” yet it has the only definite program of any party today\r\nbefore the American people. It has a yard-stick by which all things may\r\nbe measured, whether they be burlap, fustian, woolen, silk or some new\r\nweave of spider-web. This yard-stick is—\r\n\r\nEQUAL RIGHTS TO ALL, SPECIAL PRIVILEGES TO NONE.\r\n\r\nEvery fair-minded man is willing to have his economic cloth measured by\r\nthat yard-stick. Only avaricious rogues object.\r\n\r\nThe Republican Party is committed to the practice of giving special\r\nprivileges to a favored few. It is essentially a party of paternalism.\r\nThe protective tariff is paternalistic. The railroad franchise is\r\npaternalistic, and land grants, and bonds, and subsidies. The national\r\nbanking laws are paternalistic—and so, too, deposits of public revenues,\r\nand rentals on public buildings sold but never paid for. The net effect\r\nof all Republican legislation is to arm the possessors of great wealth\r\nwith some sort of taxing power, whereby they may absorb still more wealth\r\nwithout rendering an equivalent. Incidentally, it is true, some measure\r\nof prosperity may come to the more humble possessors of property—but the\r\ngeneral trend is beyond question plutocratic.\r\n\r\nThe so-called Democratic Party need not be considered here. It has no\r\nfixed policy for more than eight years at a time—except to be “agin’ the\r\ngovernment.” It is the party of negation.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist Party presents the anomaly of a party with an elaborate\r\n“scientific” system of societary evolution, an excellent interpretation\r\nof history, and forecast of the supposedly final form which society will\r\nassume—yet without a program or hint of the specific manner in which\r\nindustry will be carried on under “the collective ownership of all the\r\nmeans of production and distribution, with democratic management by\r\nthe workers engaged in each industry.” It is admitted that we have no\r\nright to ask for prophecies—but we have a right to see a rough draft\r\nat least of the new building which is to be erected after the social\r\nrevolution has torn down the old edifice. It is true that a few so-called\r\nSocialist papers pretend to tell us what will be “under Socialism”—vague,\r\nUtopian—pardon the term—“pipe dreams”; but none of them will give\r\neven an outline sketch of how collective industry might be carried on,\r\npreferring to hide behind the excuse that “we’ll cross that bridge when\r\nwe reach it.” Alas! The bridge might happen to be washed out by the\r\nfloods of social revolution.\r\n\r\nBeing an extreme on the side of materialism as opposed to idealism, or\r\ncollectivism as opposed to individualism, Socialism is quite impossible\r\nas a scheme of government. Besides, the “materialistic conception of\r\nhistory,” upon which Socialism bases its prediction of the co-operative\r\ncommonwealth, is not wholly scientific, because it fails to consider\r\nwhat changes may be wrought by invention. In a general way, it may be\r\nsaid that the invention of gunpowder destroyed feudalism, and that the\r\ndiscovery of steam power and its application to manufacturing broke up\r\nthe guild system of masters, journeymen and apprentices, and ushered in\r\nthe present wage system. Who has the hardihood to prophesy what an Edison\r\nmay not do in the years to come, or to foretell what the effect may be?\r\n\r\nThe program of Populism is at once radical and conservative. It is\r\nradical, because it goes to the root of the difficulty and will effect\r\na profound change. It is conservative, because it will enable the\r\ngreat mass of wealth producers to conserve what they now have and what\r\nthey produce in future, by exempting them from the legalized robberies\r\ncommitted by railroads, banks, trusts and other forms of predatory wealth.\r\n\r\nPopulism, recognizing the institution of private property, and the\r\npeople’s veneration and love for it, looks back over history’s pages and\r\nsees two things which, up to the recent past, have always been regarded\r\nas prerogatives of the state. One is the coinage, issue and control of\r\nmoney; the other, the ownership and control of highways.\r\n\r\nUnder the term “money” we may properly include all those modern\r\nmakeshifts which are armed with partial legal-tender power, or even those\r\nwithout such power, if they generally perform the offices of money.\r\nWithout discussing it in detail—because thousands of volumes have been\r\nwritten upon the subject without exhausting it—it seems quite certain\r\nthat if Congress is to really exercise its right—and undoubted duty—“to\r\ncoin money and regulate the value thereof,” there can be no “free”\r\ncoinage of either gold or silver; and the Government must go into the\r\nbanking business.\r\n\r\nUnder the term “highways” we may properly include railroads, canals,\r\ntelegraphs, telephones, expresses—in short, all means of transportation\r\nand communication.\r\n\r\nMost of the trust oppressions grow directly out of private ownership\r\nof the means of transportation and transmission of intelligence—the\r\nhighways—and the private issue of money. Populism asks that these great\r\nevils be corrected—and that the individual be allowed to conduct his own\r\nprivate business with the least possible interference by government.\r\nThere will always be work for the reformer; but wisdom dictates that the\r\ngreatest evils be first eliminated, so that many of a minor character may\r\nbe allowed to correct themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _To Roosevelt_\r\n\r\n\r\n    Our hero is a man of peace,\r\n      Preparedness he implores,\r\n    His sword within its scabbard sleeps,\r\n      But, mercy! how it snores!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _The Regalia of Money_\r\n\r\n                          BY ALEXANDER DEL MAR\r\n\r\n        [Mr. Del Mar’s career as a financial writer covers a period\r\n      of more than half a century. He was the financial editor\r\n      of the Washington _National Intelligencer_, the New York\r\n      _Daily American Times_, _Hunt’s Merchants’ Magazine_, _The\r\n      Social Science Review_, _The Leader_, _The Commercial\r\n      and Financial Chronicle_, and other journals of national\r\n      importance. After filling the offices of Director of the\r\n      Bureau of Statistics, Commerce and Navigation, Commissioner\r\n      to Italy, Holland and Russia, member of the United States\r\n      Monetary Commission, etc., he devoted his leisure to a\r\n      “History of Money in the Principal States of the World,”\r\n      “The Science of Money,” and other works relating to this\r\n      great subject, all of which have secured the approval\r\n      of the critical press of Europe and America and passed\r\n      through repeated editions, both in English and other\r\n      languages.—EDITOR.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the recent Presidential election the People’s Party inserted in\r\nits platform a principle of such transcendent importance that, were\r\nit generally understood, had its operation been brought home to the\r\ngreat mass of the people, could its far-reaching consequences have been\r\nportrayed so that everybody might observe them, it would have dwarfed\r\nevery other issue on that occasion presented to the country. As it was,\r\nnobody, except the few gallant leaders of the People’s Party, paid the\r\nleast attention to it, and the election was decided upon other grounds.\r\n\r\nThat principle concerned the Regalia of Money, which the People’s\r\nplatform demanded should be restored to its rightful owners, the\r\nGovernment, the people of the United States. It can be demonstrated that,\r\nhad this been done, many of the vexed questions before the country, such\r\nas the Monopolization of Industries, the Financial Trusts, the Municipal\r\nOwnership of Public Utilities, etc., would have been placed in a fair\r\nway of settlement.\r\n\r\nIn a series of magazine articles, which contain much that has the\r\nappearance of being exaggerated, untrue and vindictive, but which\r\nalso contain much that is true and susceptible of verification, Mr.\r\nThomas Lawson has been arousing the public to a sense of the dangers of\r\nthe Financiers’ System, the System by which the banks, the insurance\r\ncompanies, the trusts and the Stock Exchange are employed by so-called\r\nCaptains of Industry to despoil the people. After explaining how the game\r\nis conducted, he shows that even those who refrain from gambling on the\r\nStock Exchange, and who may have no financial transactions beyond keeping\r\na bank account or insuring their lives, are drawn into it, against their\r\nknowledge and will, and robbed of all the fruits of their labor and\r\nabstinence.\r\n\r\nLawson began his articles by accusing certain persons and putting up\r\nbluffs; a mode of argument which he soon found was not convincing. He now\r\nperceives that the fault lies in the System, and that at the bottom of\r\nthe System lies the subject of Money. The whole series of transactions\r\nwhich, he alleges, have in the course of a few years taken several\r\nthousand millions out of the pockets of the masses and transferred them\r\ninto those of a few cunning and unscrupulous operators, hung upon this\r\nsingle question: Shall the Government of the United States exercise\r\nits Regalia of Money or not? Mr. Lawson keeps up the interest of his\r\nreaders by promising them a remedy for the disorders he describes. Should\r\nthe remedy not include the regulation of Money, I hazard nothing in\r\npredicting that it will prove an entire failure and delusion.\r\n\r\nWhat is the Regalia of Money? Is it some new-fangled notion about the\r\ncoinage, some argument which turns upon the obscure meaning of Value,\r\nsome phase of the tiresome Silver Question? Nothing of the kind. The\r\nRegalia of Money is a prerogative of government, familiar to every\r\njurisconsult; a well-known, clearly defined and necessary attribute of\r\nSovereign Power. It is laid down in all the great law books, in Budelius,\r\nGrotius, Puffendorf, Vattel, Molinæus, Grimaudet, Wheaton, Martens,\r\nand a host of other authorities. It is described as “a power which the\r\nstate reserves to itself, for its own safety and welfare”; the power\r\nto create money, give it denomination and control its issues. Like the\r\npower to make war, peace and treaties, and to establish uniform weights\r\nand measures, it is called regalia, because it belongs to and must be\r\nexercised alone by sovereign states, as a prerogative which is necessary\r\nto their welfare, and essential to their autonomy, dignity and authority.\r\n\r\nWhen the American Republic was established the Regalia of Money was\r\nexercised by all of the Colonies which united to form the Federation,\r\nwhereupon, and as a matter of necessity, they all surrendered it to the\r\ngeneral Government, which, under the Constitution, alone has the power to\r\nissue money and regulate its value or denominations. It was a misfortune\r\nthat when the Union was formed it was so poor that it was obliged to\r\ntolerate the issuance of money by a private corporation, the Bank of\r\nPennsylvania. Out of that bank grew all of the so-called state banks\r\nof a subsequent period, and out of those state banks, during the Civil\r\nWar, grew all of the so-called National banks. Every one of these banks,\r\nboth “state” and “National,” were all, and are yet, private banks, their\r\ntitles in every case being misnomers. It is not intended to say a word\r\nagainst banks as guardians and lenders of money; on the contrary, they\r\nare recognized as highly useful and even indispensable institutions. As a\r\nrule, they are conducted by respectable and honorable men, and it cannot\r\nbe disputed that they have done much to promote the progress of industry\r\nand the prosperity of trade. Whether they would have done more or less\r\nin these directions had they not been permitted to usurp the Regalia\r\nof Money, which act forms no necessary part of a banking business, it\r\nis not proposed to discuss. Said Mr. Jefferson: “I have ever been the\r\nenemy of banks; not of those discounting for cash, but of those foisting\r\n_their own money_ into circulation, and thus banishing _our_ cash.” What\r\ninfluence, whether for good or evil, which this usurpation of the Regalia\r\nexercised in his day it is now too late to examine.\r\n\r\nBut the time has come when the relinquishment of the Regalia to the banks\r\ncan no longer be tolerated. The bankers have had a century of profitable\r\ninnings; the people now demand theirs. The state laws of incorporation\r\nare so contradictory, loose and pliable that there have grown up under\r\nthem companies and institutions so constituted that, in combination\r\nwith banks usurping the Regalia, it is in their power—and this is what\r\nMr. Lawson has shown very effectively—to strip the nation over and over\r\nagain of its earnings, and eventually to absorb its entire wealth. It\r\nis scarcely too much to say that unless the United States Government\r\nresumes this Regalia, and absolutely prohibits the circulation of any\r\nmoney, whether of metal or paper, not of its own immediate issuance, we\r\nwill find ourselves in the course of very few years hopelessly in debt to\r\na band of absentee millionaires, who, having shown us their heels, will\r\nnext show us their teeth.\r\n\r\nIt is not alone the people who are in danger of being impoverished by\r\nthe System, it is not alone that the Government will be jeopardized;\r\nit is also that the banks, the insurance companies and numerous other\r\nclasses of trade corporations will themselves be drawn into the nets\r\nthat are being spread for them, nets strewn with their own bird-lime,\r\nand delivered over to the scheming millionaires who are preparing to\r\nplunder them. Mr. Lawson wholly neglects this phase of the subject. His\r\nardor is all for the dear people, to arouse whose righteous indignation,\r\nhe informs us, he is expending a fortune. Such reckless munificence,\r\non the part of a man who ostentatiously advertises himself as the\r\nmanager or director of several corporations, goes far toward indicating\r\nthe correctness of our position. It is not doubted that Mr. Lawson\r\nsympathizes with the people and is anxious to point out the dangers\r\nthat threaten them. On the other hand, it cannot be supposed that he is\r\nindifferent to the fate of the banks and other companies with which he is\r\nconnected. The fact is that, having thoroughly skinned the people, the\r\nCaptains of Industry are now prepared to skin the corporations, and that\r\nit is going to skin them with weapons plucked from its victims. These\r\nweapons are the notes which the banks have issued in defiance of the\r\nRegalia of Money.\r\n\r\nThe banks will perhaps more fully appreciate the sort of people they are\r\ndealing with if we interpolate at this point a few words touching their\r\nhumanity. The principal, almost the sole lever with which the Captains\r\nof Industry are “working” this nation, is the issue of “National”\r\nbank-notes, and the elastic feature conferred upon it by law. This system\r\nwas established by Salmon P. Chase, ex-Governor of Ohio, ex-Senator of\r\nthe United States, then Secretary of the Treasury, and afterward Chief\r\nJustice of the United States; a man of the highest integrity, and perhaps\r\nfor that reason wholly incapable of coping with Mr. John Thompson and the\r\nother Chevaliers of Industry of the last generation. It will naturally be\r\nsupposed that had this class of men the slightest taint of humanity they\r\nwould at least have taken care to honor the memory of their principal\r\nbenefactor. Well, we will show you how they did it. Judge Chase, after\r\nserving his country in many capacities during a long lifetime, expired\r\nin poverty and in debt; his daughter died of grief and starvation; his\r\ngrandchildren are at present living in very humble circumstances; his\r\npersonal effects, his books, even the petty keepsakes and trinkets of his\r\nchildren, were exposed to the gaze of the vulgar and sold at a public\r\nauction in New York to satisfy his creditors, the rapacious Captains of\r\nIndustry; while the body of this great but guileless man lies today in an\r\nobscure churchyard, without a tombstone over it. Such is the humanity of\r\nthe Captains of Industry.\r\n\r\nIt is an essential part of the merry game which these Captains are\r\npermitted to play that they shall always have in their hands the means\r\nalternately to inflate and contract the currency, at any given point,\r\nsay, for example, New York. With the mints restricted to the coinage\r\nof metal for private persons, and the hands of the Government tied\r\nto a fixed issue of greenbacks, while their own hands are free, the\r\nmischievous elasticity which they employ for the success of their\r\noperations is easily acquired by getting command of the principal banks\r\nof issue. The moment they press their fingers on this button the market\r\nimmediately responds by throwing its stocks overboard; and the moment\r\nthey release the button, up rise the stocks again. It is by means of this\r\nsimple mechanism that the public has been plundered, and that it is now\r\nplanned to plunder the companies. That there is no longer any art in the\r\ntrained motorman’s vocation is proved by the small wages he commands.\r\nThe art is in providing the power and controlling the mechanism which\r\ndrives the cars. In the Captains-of-Industry game the power is derived\r\nfrom the elastic bank issues: the mechanism consists of certain banks and\r\ninsurance companies and the Stock Exchange. Given the power and mechanism\r\nwhich these establishments furnish, any bandit could work the game and\r\nhave plenty of leisure to spare. The System is automatic.\r\n\r\nIn contemplating this scene of legalized robbery, euphemistically termed\r\n“finance,” it will not do to lose our heads. There are banks and banks,\r\nthere are insurance companies and insurance companies, there are trade\r\ncorporations and trade corporations. They are not all alike. Some are\r\nin the game, as vassals and creatures of the Captains; some are in it,\r\nhoping, alas! but vainly, to outlive the Captains and profit by their\r\nfall; while others are out of it altogether; good, sound companies,\r\nsafely managed and cautious to avoid contamination. The banks and other\r\ncompanies last named will not suffer from collapse, they will always\r\ncontinue to be solvent; but they will suffer from a forced conservatism\r\nand from an unduly small share of business, until our deluded people wake\r\nup and smash some furniture, or until the banks themselves recognize\r\nthe dangerous part which their own issues play in this pandemonium of\r\nrascality. They will then be glad voluntarily to surrender them into the\r\nhands of the Government.\r\n\r\nIf now it be asked in what manner will the opportunities of the Captains\r\nfor robbing the community be restrained or curtailed by substituting\r\nGovernment money for bank-notes, the reply is that the beneficial effects\r\nof such restraint will not arise so much from a difference in the money\r\nas from a difference in the power to issue or retire it. And in a future\r\narticle will be shown, by practical examples, the difference between the\r\nworking of an elastic currency when such elasticity is controlled by the\r\nGovernment, and when it is controlled, as it now is, by the Chevaliers of\r\nIndustry.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“My agency in procuring the passage of the National Bank Act was the\r\ngreatest financial mistake of my life.

It is difficult to address an appeal to a\r\npeople which prefers to venerate that roof on account of its antiquity,\r\nrather than to repair the innumerable leaks and fissures due to decay and\r\nto the gales and storms of more than a hundred years.\r\n\r\nThe man who venerates any work of human origin is an ass. His asininity\r\nis exactly in degree with the smallness of the objects selected for\r\nhis veneration. The man who humbly lowers his eyes in contemplation of\r\na political constitution proclaims a lack of mental breadth fitted to\r\ncomprehend humanity or to understand the plain lessons of history, and\r\nhe has insulted the one entity worthy of veneration—the Maker of the\r\nUniverse.\r\n\r\nIn a preceding article I proved that the framers of the Constitution\r\ndistrusted the people almost to the point of hatred, and that they\r\ndeliberately planned to design a document which would give them the\r\nsemblance of popular rule but none of its substance. This is an\r\nunquestioned historical fact. Its declaration may seem startling to those\r\nwho are confronted with the unvarnished truth for the first time, but\r\nthey will find it refreshing to study the real history of those days,\r\nrather than ignorantly to worship demigods who never existed.\r\n\r\nImmutable laws cannot be coexistent with progress. We should study the\r\npast, not for the purpose of supinely imitating it, but with a view of\r\nprofiting by its mistakes. That government is best which avoids the\r\npitfalls of the past, exists for those who live today, and erects no\r\nbarriers for the generations that will follow.\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of those who still cling to the belief that\r\nconstitutional wisdom had its birth with Washington and his compatriots,\r\nI take the liberty of quoting a few extracts from letters written by the\r\nFather of his Country before and after the constitutional convention had\r\nfinished its labors. These utterances of Washington are trite and easily\r\nunderstood, and since their authenticity is unquestioned, they possess as\r\nmuch of inspiration as any wisdom coming from him or his colleagues.\r\n\r\nThese extracts are contained in letters written by Washington to leading\r\nmen of that period, urging them to give their support to the adoption of\r\nthe new Constitution, and he pinned his faith to one argument, as you\r\nshall see. I commend to all idolaters of that document a careful reading\r\nof Washington’s opinion of it, and his advice to them.\r\n\r\nShortly before the convention met he wrote a letter to John Jay, bearing\r\nthe date of March 10, 1787. The convention assembled May 14 of that year.\r\nIn that letter Washington said:\r\n\r\n“Notwithstanding the boasted virtue of America, it is more than probable\r\nwe shall exhibit the last melancholy proof that mankind _are not\r\ncompetent to their own government without the means of coercion in a\r\nsovereign_.”\r\n\r\nThere is no occult meaning hidden in these words. Washington had no\r\nfaith in the capacity of the people to govern themselves, and did not\r\nhesitate to say so. In this, as I proved in a preceding article, he was\r\nin accord with the overwhelming majority of the delegates who composed\r\nthat convention. The question I desire to ask is this: Was Washington\r\ninspired when he wrote those lines to John Jay, and if not, when did his\r\ninspiration begin?\r\n\r\nLet us see what he wrote after the convention had finished its work. On\r\nJanuary 12, 1788, he wrote to Mr. Charles Carter as follows:\r\n\r\n“I am not a blind admirer (for I saw its imperfections) of the\r\nConstitution to which I have assisted to give birth; but I am fully\r\npersuaded it is the best that can be obtained at this day, and that it\r\nis it or disunion before us. When the defects of it are experienced, a\r\nconstitutional door is open for amendments.”\r\n\r\nThere is nothing evasive about this, but those who now repeat such\r\nsentiments are suspected of treason by fools, and of a lack of patriotism\r\nby unthinking conservatives. On February 7, 1788, Washington wrote to\r\nLafayette and said:\r\n\r\n“Should the Constitution which is now offered to the people of America be\r\nfound on experiment less perfect than it can be made, a constitutional\r\ndoor is left open for its amelioration.”\r\n\r\nWe have made that experiment. Have we found the Constitution perfect?\r\nWhere is that “constitutional door,” and why do we not open it?\r\n\r\nWriting from Mount Vernon in October, 1787, to Henry Knox, Washington\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“Is there not a constitutional door open for alterations and amendments?\r\nIs it not likely that real defects will be as readily discovered after as\r\nbefore trial? Will not our successors be as ready to apply the remedy as\r\nourselves, if occasion should demand it? To think otherwise will, in my\r\nopinion, be ascribing more love of country, more wisdom and more virtue\r\nto ourselves than I think we deserve.”\r\n\r\nDear Shade of Washington! You may have been inspired, but you were not\r\nable to foresee the bigotry, the ignorance and the cowardice of your\r\ndescendants. In the language of Cicero, “we are so tied to certain\r\nbeliefs that we are bound to defend even those we do not approve.” We\r\nare like the fools Montaigne describes, “who do not ask whether such and\r\nsuch a thing be true, but whether it has been so and so understood.” We\r\nknow that the Constitution is full of errors, but all that we ask is\r\nthat we may be given the wisdom so to interpret it as to suffer as few\r\ndiscomforts from its perpetual operation as possible. In the language of\r\nSeneca, we believe in “not only a necessity of erring, but we have a\r\nlove of error.”\r\n\r\nOne more of the innumerable quotations of like purport from George\r\nWashington will be sufficient. On November 10, 1787, he wrote from Mount\r\nVernon to Bushrod Washington and said:\r\n\r\n“The people (for it is with them to judge) can, as they will have the\r\nadvantage of experience on their side, decide with as much propriety on\r\nthe alterations and amendments which are necessary as ourselves. I do\r\nnot think we are more inspired, have more wisdom or possess more virtue\r\nthan those who will come after us. The power under the Constitution will\r\nalways be with the people.”\r\n\r\nI have been a fairly zealous student of American history, yet I have\r\nnever seen these quotations from the writings of George Washington in\r\nprint outside of the huge compilation of his documents and letters to\r\nbe found in well-ordered reference libraries. Certain it is that our\r\nschool children are not taught that such characters as Washington doubted\r\nthe absolute perfection of the Constitution. Certain it is that not one\r\nman in ten thousand in the United States ever has had an opportunity to\r\nconsider our Constitution in the light of the facts presented in this\r\npaper and in the one which preceded it.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that the people of the United States are unfamiliar not\r\nonly with the history of the formation of the Constitution, but the vast\r\nmajority of them do not know what it contains. Many of them confound the\r\nDeclaration of Independence with the Constitution. What is the “Open\r\nDoor” in the Constitution to which Washington repeatedly refers?\r\n\r\nBefore considering that, let us list a few of the abuses which the more\r\nthoughtful admit exist under our Constitution. Ignoring all of lesser\r\nimportance I will name four, any one of which constitutes a menace to the\r\nperpetuation of free government. These are as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst, the election of a President and Vice-President under the absurd\r\nand antiquated method provided by the Constitution, in which citizens\r\nvote for electors, and the decision is made by the unit vote of states,\r\nirrespective of the majorities cast. Under this grotesque system it\r\nhas repeatedly happened that candidates obtaining an actual majority\r\nof the votes cast have been defeated by the minority. There is not one\r\nvalid argument in favor of the continuance of this unrepublican and\r\nundemocratic elective monstrosity.\r\n\r\nSecond, the election of senators by the state legislatures, a system\r\nwhich is the fountain-head of the corruption of American politics, and\r\nwhich has given us a Senate, a large percentage of whose members owe\r\ntheir selection to selfish private interests. The error of this system\r\nhas been so conclusively shown that there is no honest defense for it.\r\nThe founders of the Constitution designed it for the purpose of making\r\nthe Senate the citadel of patriotic wealth; it has degenerated into\r\na chamber in which the admitted representatives of vested interests\r\ndefend their masters against fair legislative enactments, and force\r\nunfair compromises on the popular branch which constitutes the House of\r\nRepresentatives.\r\n\r\nThird, the equal representation of unequal states in the Senate. This\r\nvicious compromise was made in the constitutional convention as the\r\nprice of the perpetuation of slavery. There was no justification for it\r\neven at a time when this nation was no more than a federation of states.\r\nWashington, Madison, Randolph, Morris, Franklin and every broad-minded\r\nman in that convention protested against it, and their fame is tarnished\r\nbecause they finally submitted to so cowardly and unfair a compromise.\r\nNow that the logic of events has made this a nation, despite the\r\nrestrictive clauses of the Constitution, the dual participation of an\r\nunrepresentative Senate is so grotesque that its continuance is fraught\r\nwith a danger which at any time is likely to precipitate civil war,\r\nin the event that at some crucial moment this body shall exercise its\r\nconstitutional powers combined with those it has arrogated.\r\n\r\nUnless the Constitution be entirely repealed, there is no way by\r\namendment to deprive any state of its equal representation in the Senate.\r\nIt is too much to expect that all of the corrupt boroughs which now hold\r\nthe undeserved dignity of statehood will relinquish the selfish advantage\r\nbequeathed them by the unwisdom of the forefathers, but it is possible\r\nto make amendments to the Constitution which will reduce the Senate of\r\nthe United States to a state of harmless inefficiency. It is possible to\r\npreserve its form and extract its substance, and the people should set\r\nabout the task with no qualms of conscience. Great Britain showed the\r\nway when she boldly reduced her House of Lords to a condition of docile\r\nvassalage to the popular branch of her Parliament, and she was aroused\r\nto this righteous act of retaliation by abuses which were of small\r\nconsequence compared to those from which we have tamely suffered. It is\r\npossible, under the Constitution, to strip the Senate of its legislative\r\npower, permitting it to retain its feature of unequal representation, and\r\nreserving for it a chamber in which those who wish for the honor can keep\r\nup the pretense of governmental power and prestige.\r\n\r\nFourth, the specific enumeration and limitation of the powers and\r\nfunctions of the Federal Judiciary, including the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States and all other courts authorized by Congress. This is the\r\nparamount subject for constitutional amendment or revision. The founders\r\nof our Government did not contemplate any such grant of power as now is\r\nwielded by the courts. There is nothing in the document itself which\r\nwarrants the prerogatives which have been assumed by the courts, and\r\nthe records of the speeches and the proceedings in the constitutional\r\nconvention when the judiciary was under consideration contain no hint\r\nthat they were to be granted the power to annul a law passed by Congress\r\nand signed by the President of the United States. Years passed before\r\nthe Supreme Court dared attempt such a step, and when it did Jefferson\r\nscornfully ignored its mandate. Presidents as late as Lincoln have\r\ndeclined to acquiesce in the interference of the Federal Courts, but\r\nslowly and insidiously this branch of the Government has reached out and\r\ngrasped power, until today it is supreme in fact as well as in name.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court is the creature of the Presidents and is subject to\r\nthe direction of Congress, yet it has arrogated to itself the power of\r\noverriding the will of the entire people as recorded by its Congress\r\nand affirmed by its chief executive. If they are doing this without\r\nwarrant of the Constitution, the day will come when, in the inevitable\r\nconflict between the court and the Congress or the President, or both\r\ncombined, there will be precipitated a question which will rend the\r\ncountry with civil war. If they do this under the implied authority of\r\nthe Constitution, that document should be amended so as to preclude\r\ntheir future interference with laws passed by Congress and signed by the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nAs we exist today we are not a republic or a democracy, neither have we\r\na representative form of government. We are a “judiciary”—if one may\r\ncoin such a word. Ours is the only country on earth where an elective\r\nor appointed judge presumes to wield the most autocratic power of the\r\nabsolute monarch, viz., the veto of a law passed and demanded by the\r\npeople. We have become so accustomed to this that we do not properly\r\nrealize what it means. We teach ourselves to acknowledge the “sacredness\r\nof the judiciary” and to bow in humble contrition to any mandate\r\nthundered from the Bench. We assent to the insane doctrine that there is\r\nnot enough of wisdom in a House of Representatives elected by 17,000,000\r\nvoters, combined with the check of an ultra-conservative Senate chosen\r\nby forty-five state legislatures, and indorsed by the judgment and\r\nresponsibility of a President, to incorporate for our government a law\r\nuntil such law has been affirmed by the majority of a Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nIf there be sense in this dogma, I am unable to see why it is not equally\r\njust that a minority of the Supreme Court should not be empowered to\r\nannul laws. Why does the Supreme Court cling to the inconsistent theory\r\nthat its majority possesses as much wisdom as its minority?\r\n\r\nIn a series of articles which I am now preparing, I am attempting to\r\ndiscuss certain of these questions with as much frankness as I possess;\r\nbut the purpose of this paper, and the one which preceded it, is to\r\ncall attention to “the unopened door in the Constitution”—the one which\r\nWashington repeatedly referred to in the passages from which I have\r\nquoted. It is a difficult matter to arouse public attention to any single\r\namendment, no matter how important the subject may be. There is a reason\r\nfor this.\r\n\r\nThe people instinctively know that no one amendment can redress the\r\nills which now exist. They do not know how to go about a crusade for\r\nconstitutional reform, and most of them probably imagine that there is\r\nno way in which it can be done. There is a way, a simple, practical\r\nand legal way, and the political party which takes advantage of it and\r\nconducts an intelligent campaign in its behalf will sweep all before it.\r\n\r\nHere is “The Open Door of the Constitution of the United States,” as\r\ncontained in Article V of that document:\r\n\r\n        The Congress, whenever two-thirds of both Houses shall\r\n      deem it necessary, shall propose amendments to this\r\n      Constitution, or, on the application of the legislatures\r\n      of two-thirds of the several states, _shall call a\r\n      convention for proposing amendments_, which, in either\r\n      case, shall be valid to all intents and purposes as part\r\n      of this Constitution, when ratified by the legislatures of\r\n      three-fourths of the several states, _or by conventions\r\n      in three-fourths thereof, as the one or the other mode of\r\n      ratification may be proposed by the Congress_; provided\r\n      that no amendment which may be made prior to the year 1808\r\n      shall in any manner affect the first and fourth clauses of\r\n      the Ninth Section of the First Article; and that no state,\r\n      without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal suffrage\r\n      in the Senate.\r\n\r\nThere is a door as wide as that of a church. It is the most liberal and\r\ndemocratic feature of a document filled with restrictions, and Washington\r\nand others were justified in assuming that we would have the sense to\r\nwalk through it, rather than to attempt to get in by scaling the walls\r\nand crawling through a steeple window.\r\n\r\nOur alleged progressive political platforms are of no value without a\r\ndemand for the revision of the Constitution of the United States along\r\nsome such lines as I have attempted to outline. It is idle to expect the\r\npeople to rally to the support of any reform, however badly needed, so\r\nlong as they have valid reasons to believe there is likelihood that a\r\nbill in its behalf will meet the fate of the lamented income tax law. Why\r\nask them to shoot in the air when so broad a target is before them?\r\n\r\nThe wise thing to do is to attack boldly the unfair provisions of\r\nthe Constitution, and attack it with a fair weapon fashioned by the\r\nConstitution. Such a campaign possesses all the elements of strength and\r\nstrategy. You are safe from the attacks of those who ever hide behind the\r\nalleged sanctity of that document. You can turn their own weapons against\r\nthem. You are standing on the Constitution. You are following to the\r\nletter the advice and wishes of Washington and others of his day.\r\n\r\nThe bulls and excommunications of the courts need not dismay you. Are not\r\nthey the creatures of the Constitution? Does anyone deny that there is a\r\npossibility that the courts have gone beyond their constitutional powers?\r\nIs it not within the province of the free people to amend a constitution\r\nby constitutional means?\r\n\r\nAgain, a movement for any one of the reforms which are now pressing to\r\nthe fore would appeal with irresistible force to its advocates if they\r\nknew that success at the polls would incorporate its provisions in the\r\norganic law of the land. Those who believe that the best interests of\r\nthe nation will be conserved by more just systems of taxation, by direct\r\nlegislation, by the control or ownership of the means of transportation\r\nand other measures in line with the logic of events, would know that\r\nthey were not fighting in vain if a victory with the ballot meant a\r\nlegislative victory.\r\n\r\nI hold that the “Open Door” offers not only the one way to popular\r\ntriumph, but that success by it is certain and not difficult of\r\nattainment. Our national structure totters because of an antique and\r\ncrumbling foundation. Rebuild it!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _To One Departed_\r\n\r\n\r\n    Sitting, apart in the café, under a glare of light,\r\n    Surrounded by wealth and beauty, I ponder here tonight.\r\n    ’Tis down in old New Orleans and the Carnival is in sway,\r\n    There are music, jest and laughter—the revelry of the gay.\r\n\r\n    While sitting here alone, dear, midst all this merry throng,\r\n    The band begins to play, dear, our old, best loved song;\r\n    They call it, dear, “Love’s Old Sweet Song,” and oh, it brings to me\r\n    A longing deep to lay me down and rest, sweetheart, by thee.\r\n\r\n    I listen to the music and hear the chattering throng,\r\n    There steals o’er me a wondrous spell, again I hear the song\r\n    _As sung by you_, in the long ago, whose sweetness was so brief,\r\n    And now, alone, I sit here with your memory and my grief.\r\n\r\n    I have wandered over many lands in search of something true,\r\n    And now I know, my darling, I found it but in you.\r\n    I’ve searched afar for sweet content, and sought in vain for rest,\r\n    I know I ne’er could find it, dear, save on thy faithful breast.\r\n\r\n    Amidst this scene of life and mirth it is for you I crave,\r\n    I seem to stand a thousand miles away, beside your grave,\r\n    And see the stars that o’er it, there, a gentle vigil keep,\r\n    And kiss the flowers that wave o’er you, my sweetheart, in your sleep.\r\n\r\n    So, sitting here, surrounded thus by joy and beauty rare\r\n    With much to bring me happiness, and much to banish care,\r\n    I know that now and evermore, I’ll always love you best,\r\n    And learn to lie beside you, dear, to sleep—to sleep and rest.\r\n\r\n    My eyes grow dim with longing; my heart grows numb with pain;\r\n    I feel that you are waiting, dear, to clasp me once again.\r\n    My soul pines for the journey’s end, when I, too, shall be free,\r\n    And I’ll lie down to sleep, love, in the last long sleep, near thee.\r\n\r\n                                                         BERNARD P.

Springtown’s principal church\r\nstood in the edge of the village, on the red clay road leading up the\r\nmountainside, now in the delicate green of spring, touched here and there\r\nby fragrant splotches of pink honeysuckle and white, dark-eyed dogwood\r\nblossoms. The building was a diminutive affair, with five shuttered\r\nwindows on either side, a pulpit at one end and a door at the other.\r\nA single aisle cut the rough benches into two halves, one side being\r\noccupied by the men and the other by the women. The only exception to\r\nthis rule was a bench set aside, as if by common consent, for Captain\r\nDuncan, who always sat with his family, as did any male guests who\r\nattended service with them.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Jason Hillhouse was the regular pastor. He was under thirty\r\nyears of age, very tall, slight of build and nervous in temperament.\r\nHe wore the conventional black frock coat, high-cut waistcoat, black\r\nnecktie and gray trousers. He was popular. He had applied himself closely\r\nto the duties of his calling and was considered a man of character and\r\nworth. While not a college graduate, he was yet sufficiently well-read\r\nin the Bible and religious literature to suit even the more progressive\r\nof mountain churchgoers. He differed radically from many of the young\r\npreachers who were living imitations of that noted evangelist, the Rev.\r\nTom P. Smith, “the whirlwind preacher,” in that he was conservative in\r\nthe selection of topics for discourse and in his mild delivery.\r\n\r\nToday he was at his best. Few in the congregation suspected it, but if\r\nhe distributed his glances evenly over the upturned faces, his thoughts\r\nwere focussed on only one personality—that of modest Cynthia Porter, who,\r\nin a becoming gray gown, sat with her mother on the third bench from the\r\nfront. Mrs. Porter, a woman fifty-five years of age, was very plainly\r\nattired in a homespun dress, to which she had added no ornament of any\r\nkind. She wore a gingham poke-bonnet, the hood of which hid her face\r\neven from the view of the minister. Her husband, old Nathan Porter, sat\r\ndirectly across the aisle from her. He was one of the roughest-looking\r\nmen in the house. He had come without his coat, and wore no collar or\r\nnecktie, and for comfort, as the day was warm, he had even thrown off the\r\nburden of his suspenders, which lay in careless loops about his hips.\r\nHe had a broad expanse of baldness, to the edge of which hung a narrow\r\nfringe of white hair, a healthful, pink complexion and blue eyes.\r\n\r\nWhen the sermon was over and the doxology sung, the preacher stepped down\r\ninto the congregation to take the numerous hands cordially extended to\r\nhim. While he was thus engaged old Mayhew came from the amen corner on\r\nthe right, and nodded and smiled patronizingly.\r\n\r\n“You did pretty well today, young man,” he said. “I like doctrinal talks.\r\nThere’s no getting around good, sound doctrine, Hillhouse. We’d have\r\nless lawlessness if we could keep our people filled plumb full of sound\r\ndoctrine. But you don’t look like you’ve been eating enough, my boy. Come\r\nhome with me and I’ll give you a good dinner. I heard a fat hen squeal\r\nearly this morning, as my cook jerked her head off. It looks a pity to\r\ntake life on a Sunday, but if that hen had been allowed to live, she\r\nmight have broken a commandment by hunting for worms on this day of rest.\r\nCome on with me.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t, Brother Mayhew; not today, thank you.” The young man flushed as\r\nhis glance struggled on to the Porters, who were waiting near the door.\r\n“The fact is, I’ve already accepted an invitation.”\r\n\r\n“From somebody with a girl in the family, I’ll bet.” Mayhew laughed as\r\nhe playfully thrust the crooked end of his walking-stick against the\r\npreacher’s side. “I wish I knew why so many women are dead set on getting\r\na preacher in the family. It may be because they know they will be\r\nprovided for after some fashion or other by the church at large, in case\r\nof death or accident.”\r\n\r\nThe preacher laughed as he moved on, shaking hands and dispensing cheery\r\nwords of welcome right and left. Presently the way was clear and he found\r\nhimself near Cynthia and her mother.\r\n\r\n“Sorry to keep you standing here,” he said, his color rising as he took\r\nthe girl’s hand.\r\n\r\n“Oh, it doesn’t matter at all, Brother Hillhouse,” the old woman assured\r\nhim. “I’ll go on an’ overtake Mr. Porter; you and Cynthia can stroll\r\nhome by the shadiest way. You needn’t walk fast; you’ll get hot if you\r\ndo. Cynthia, I won’t need you before dinner. I’ve got everything ready,\r\nwith nothing to do but lay back the cloth and push the plates into their\r\nplaces. I want Brother Hillhouse just to taste that pound cake you made.\r\nI’m a good hand at desserts myself, Brother Hillhouse, but she can beat\r\nme any day in the week.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I know Miss Cynthia can cook,” said the minister. “At the picnic at\r\nCohutta Springs last week she took the prize for her fried chicken.”\r\n\r\n“I told you all that mother fried that chicken,” said the girl\r\nindifferently. She had seen Nelson Floyd mounting his fine Kentucky horse\r\namong the trees across the street, and had deliberately turned her back\r\ntoward him.\r\n\r\n“Well, I believe I _did_ fix the chicken,” Mrs. Porter admitted, “but\r\nshe made the custards and the cake and icing. Besides, the poor girl was\r\nhaving a lot of trouble with her dress. She washed and did up that muslin\r\ntwice—the iron spoiled it the first time. I declare I’d have been out of\r\nheart, but she was cheerful all through it. Here comes Nathan now. He\r\nnever will go home by himself; he is afraid I’ll lag behind and he’ll get\r\na late dinner.”\r\n\r\n“How are you today, Brother Porter?” Hillhouse asked as they came upon\r\nthe old man under the trees, a little way from the church.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I’m about as common,” was the drawling answer. “You may notice that\r\nI limp a little in my left leg. Ever since I had white swellin’ I’ve had\r\ntrouble with that selfsame leg. I wish you folks would jest stop an’ take\r\na peep at it. It looks to me like the blood’s quit circulatin’ in the\r\nveins. It went to sleep while you was a-talkin’ this mornin’—now, I’ll\r\nswear I didn’t mean that as a reflection.”\r\n\r\nHe paused at a fallen tree, put his foot upon it and started to roll up\r\nthe leg of his trousers, but his wife drew him on impatiently.\r\n\r\n“I wonder what you’ll do next,” she said reprovingly. “This is no time\r\nand place for that. What would the Duncans think if they was to drive by\r\nwhile you was doing the like of that on a public road? Come on with me,\r\nand let’s leave the young folks to themselves.”\r\n\r\nGrumblingly Porter obeyed. His wife walked briskly and made him keep pace\r\nwith her, and they were soon several yards ahead of the young couple.\r\nHillhouse was silent for several minutes, and his smooth-shaven face was\r\nquite serious in expression.\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid I’m going to bore you on that same old line, Miss Cynthia,”\r\nhe said presently. “Really, I can’t well help it. This morning I fancied\r\nyou listened attentively to what I was saying in my sermon.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, I always do that,” the girl returned, with an almost\r\nperceptible shudder of her shoulders.\r\n\r\n“It helped me wonderfully, Miss Cynthia, and once a hope actually flashed\r\nthrough me so strong that I lost my place. You may have seen me turning\r\nthe pages of the Bible. I was trying to think where I’d left off. The\r\nhope was this: that some day, if I keep on begging you, and showing my\r\ndeep respect and regard you will not turn me away. Just for one minute\r\nthis morning it seemed to me that you had actually consented, and—and the\r\nthought was too much for me.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, don’t speak any more about it, Mr. Hillhouse,” Cynthia pleaded,\r\ngiving him a full look from her wonderful brown eyes. “I have already\r\nsaid all I can to you.”\r\n\r\n“But I’ve known many of the happiest marriages to finally result from\r\nnothing but the sheer persistence of the man concerned, and when I think\r\nof _that_—and when I think of the chance of losing you, it nearly drives\r\nme crazy. I can’t help feeling that way. You are simply all I care for on\r\nearth. Do you remember when I first met you? It was at Hattie Mayfield’s\r\nparty, just after I got this appointment; we sat on the porch alone and\r\ntalked. I reckon it was merely your respect for my calling that made you\r\nso attentive, but I went home that night out of my head with admiration.\r\nThen I saw that Frank Miller was going with you everywhere, and that\r\npeople thought you were engaged, and, as I did not admire his moral\r\ncharacter, I was very miserable in secret. Then I saw that he stopped,\r\nand I got it from a reliable source that you had refused him because you\r\ndid not want to marry such a man, and my hopes and admiration climbed\r\nstill higher. You had proved that you were the kind of a woman for a\r\npreacher’s wife—the kind of woman I’ve always dreamed of having as my\r\ncompanion in life.”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t love him, that was all,” Cynthia said calmly. “It would not\r\nhave been fair to him or myself to have received his constant attentions.”\r\n\r\n“But now I am down in the dregs again, Miss Cynthia.” Hillhouse gave a\r\nsigh. It was almost a groan.\r\n\r\nShe glanced at him once and then lowered her eyes half fearfully. And,\r\ngetting his breath rapidly, the preacher bent more closely over her\r\nshoulder, as if to catch some reply from her lips. She made none.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I’m in the dregs again—miserable, afraid, jealous! You know why,\r\nMiss Cynthia. You know that any lover would be concerned to see the girl\r\nupon whom he had based his every hope going often with Nelson Floyd. Of\r\nall men, he——”\r\n\r\n“Stop!” The girl paused, turned upon him suddenly and gazed at him\r\nsteadily. “If you have anything to say about him don’t say it to me. He’s\r\nmy friend, and I will not listen to anything against those I like.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not going to criticize him.” Hillhouse bit his white, unsteady lip.\r\n“A man’s a fool who tries to win by running down his rival. The way to\r\nrun a man up in a woman’s eyes is to openly run him down. Men are strong\r\nenough to bear such things, but women shelter them like they do their\r\nbabies. No, I wasn’t going to run him down, but I am afraid of him. When\r\nyou go out driving with him, I——”\r\n\r\nAgain Cynthia turned upon him and looked at him steadily, her eyes\r\nflashing. “Don’t go too far; you might regret it,” she said. “It is an\r\ninsult to be spoken to as you are speaking to me.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, don’t, don’t! You misunderstand me,” protested the bewildered lover.\r\n“I—I am not afraid, you understand, of course, I’m not afraid you will\r\nnot be able to—to take care of yourself, but he has so many qualities\r\nthat win and attract women that—Oh, I’m jealous, Miss Cynthia, that’s\r\nthe whole thing in a nutshell! He has the reputation of being a great\r\nfavorite with all women, and now that he seems to admire you more than\r\nany of the rest——”\r\n\r\nThe girl raised her eyes from the ground; a touch of color rose to\r\nher cheeks. “He doesn’t admire me more than the others,” she said\r\ntentatively. “You are mistaken, Mr. Hillhouse.”\r\n\r\nHe failed to note her rising color, the subtle eagerness oozing from her\r\ncompact self-control.\r\n\r\n“No, I’m not blind,” he went on, blindly building up his rival’s cause.\r\n“He admires you extravagantly—he couldn’t help it. You are beautiful,\r\nyou have vivacity, womanly strength and a thousand other qualities that\r\nare rare in this section. Right here I want to tell you something. I\r\nknow you will laugh, for you don’t seem to care for such things, but\r\nyou know Colonel Price is quite an expert on genealogical matters. He’s\r\nmade a great study of it, and his chief hobby is that many of these\r\nsturdy mountain people are the descendants of fine old English families,\r\nfrom younger sons, you know, who settled first in Virginia and North\r\nCarolina, and then drifted into this part of Georgia. He didn’t know of\r\nmy admiration for you, but one day at the meeting of the Confederate\r\nVeterans at Springtown he saw you on the platform with the other ladies\r\nand he said: ‘I’ll tell you, Hillhouse, right there is a living proof of\r\nwhat I have always argued. That daughter of Nathan Porter’s has a face\r\nthat is as patrician as any woman of English royal birth. I understand,’\r\nthe Colonel went on, ‘that her mother was a Radcliff, which is one of the\r\nbest and most historic of the Virginia families, and Porter, as rough as\r\nhe is, comes from good old English stock.’ Do you wonder, Cynthia, that\r\nI agree with him? There really is good blood in you. Your grandmother is\r\none of the most refined and elegant old ladies I have ever met anywhere,\r\nand I have been about a good deal.”\r\n\r\n“I am not sure that Colonel Price is right,” the girl said. “I’ve heard\r\nsomething of that kind before. I think Colonel Price had an article in\r\none of the Atlanta papers about it, with a list of old family names. My\r\nfather knows little or nothing about his ancestry, but my grandmother\r\nhas always said her forefathers were wealthy people. She remembers her\r\ngrandmother as being a fine old lady, who, poor as she was, tried to make\r\nher and the other children wear their bonnets and gloves in the sun to\r\nkeep their complexions white. But I don’t like to discuss that sort of\r\nthing, Mr. Hillhouse. It won’t do in America. I think we are what we make\r\nourselves, not what others made of themselves. One is individuality, the\r\nother imitation.”\r\n\r\nThe young man laughed. “That’s all very fine,” he said, “when it was your\r\nforefathers who made it possible for you to have the mental capacity\r\nfor the very opinion you have expressed. At any rate, there is a little\r\ncomfort in your view, for if you were to pride yourself on Price’s\r\ntheories, as many a woman would, you would look higher than a poor\r\npreacher with such an untraceable name as mine. And you know, ordinary as\r\nit is, you have simply got to wear it sooner or later.”\r\n\r\n“You must not mention that again,” Cynthia said firmly. “I tell you, I am\r\nnot good enough for a minister’s wife. There is a streak of worldliness\r\nin me that I shall never overcome.”\r\n\r\n“That cuts me like a knife,” said Hillhouse. “It cuts because it\r\nreminds me of something I once heard Pole Baker say in a group at the\r\npost-office. He said that women simply do not like what is known as a\r\n‘goody-goody’ man. Sometimes as coarse a man as Pole hits the nail of\r\ntruth on the head, while a better educated man would miss and mash his\r\nthumb. But if I am in the pulpit, I’m only human. It seemed to me the\r\nother day when I saw you and Nelson Floyd driving along up the mountain\r\nthat the very fires of hell itself raged inside of me. I always hold\r\nfamily prayer at home for the benefit of my mother and sister, but that\r\nnight I cut it out and lay on the bed rolling and tossing like a crazy\r\nman. He’s handsome, Miss Cynthia, and he has a soft voice and a way of\r\nmaking all women sympathize with him—why they do it I don’t know. It’s\r\ntrue he’s had a most miserable childhood, but he is making money hand\r\nover hand now and has everything in his favor.”\r\n\r\n“He’s not a happy man, Mr. Hillhouse, in spite of his success. Anyone who\r\nknows him can see that.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I suppose he broods over the mystery that hangs over his childhood,”\r\nsaid the preacher. “That’s only natural for an ambitious man. I once knew\r\na fellow like that, and he told me he never intended to get married on\r\nthat account. He was morbidly sensitive about it, but it is different\r\nwith Floyd. He does know his name, and he will, no doubt, discover his\r\nrelatives some day. But it hurts me to see you with him so much.”\r\n\r\n“Why, he goes with other girls,” Cynthia said, her lips set together\r\ntightly, her face averted.\r\n\r\n“And perhaps you know, Miss Cynthia, that people talk about some of the\r\ngirls he has been with.”\r\n\r\n“I know,” said the girl, looking at him with an absent glance. “There\r\nis no use going over that. I hear nothing all day long at home except\r\nthat—that—that! Oh, sometimes I wish I were dead!”\r\n\r\n“Ah, that hurts worse than anything you have ever said!” declared the\r\nminister in a tone of pain as he stroked his thin face with an unsteady\r\nhand. “Why should a beautiful, pure, human flower like you be made\r\nunhappy because of contact with a human weed——?”\r\n\r\n“Stop, I tell you! Stop!” The girl stared at him with flashing eyes. “I\r\nam not going to have you talk to me as if I were a child. I know him\r\nas well as you do. You preach all day long that a person ought to be\r\nforgiven of his sins, and yet you want to load some of them down with\r\ntheirs—that is, when it suits you. He has as good a right to—to—to reform\r\nas anyone, and I, myself, have heard you say that the vilest sin often\r\npurifies and lifts one up. Don’t get warped all to one side. I shall not\r\nrespect your views any more if you do.”\r\n\r\nHillhouse was white in the face and trembling helplessly.\r\n\r\n“You are tying me hand and foot,” he said, with a groan. “If I ever had a\r\nchance to gain my desires, I am killing them, but God knows I can’t help\r\nit. I am fighting for my life.”\r\n\r\n“And behind another’s back,” added the girl firmly. “You’ve got to be\r\nfair to him! As for myself, I don’t believe half the things that the\r\nbusybodies have said about him. Let me tell you something.”\r\n\r\nThey had come to a little brook which they had to cross on brown, almost\r\nsubmerged stepping-stones, and she paused, laying her small hand on his\r\narm, and said portentously: “Nelson Floyd has been alone with me several\r\ntimes and has never yet told me that he loved me.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not going to say what is in my mind,” Hillhouse said, with a cold,\r\nsignificant sneer on his white lip, as he took her hand and helped her\r\nacross the stream.\r\n\r\n“You say you won’t?” Cynthia gave him her eyes wonderingly, almost\r\npleadingly.\r\n\r\n“That is, not unless you will let me be plain with you,” Hillhouse\r\nanswered; “as plain as I’d be to my sister.”\r\n\r\nThey walked on side by side in silence, now very near her father’s house.\r\n\r\n“You may as well finish what you were going to say,” the girl gave in,\r\nwith a sigh of resignation tinged with a curiosity that devoured her\r\nprecaution.\r\n\r\n“Well, I was going to say that, if what I have gathered here and there\r\nis true, it is Nelson Floyd’s favorite method to _look_, do you\r\nunderstand?—to _look_ love to the girls he goes with. He has never, it\r\nseems, committed himself by a scratch of a pen or by word of mouth, and\r\nyet every silly woman he has paid attention to, before he began to go\r\nwith you, has secretly sworn to herself that she was the world and all to\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\nCynthia’s face became grave. Her glance went down and for a moment she\r\nseemed incapable of speech. Finally, however, her color rose and she\r\nlaughed defiantly.\r\n\r\n“Well, here is a girl, Mr. Hillhouse, who will not be fooled that way,\r\nand you may rely on that. So, don’t worry about me. I’ll take care of\r\nmyself.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve no doubt you will,” said the preacher gloomily.\r\n\r\n“Yes, you’ll see that I can,” Cynthia declared with animation. “There’s\r\nmother on the porch. Good gracious, do change the subject. If she sets\r\nin on it, I’ll not come to the table. She likes you and hates the ground\r\nNelson Floyd walks on.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps that, too, will be my damnation,” Hillhouse retorted. “I know\r\nsomething about human nature. I may see the day that I’d be glad of a\r\ndoubtful reputation.”\r\n\r\nHe caught her reproachful glance at this remark as he opened the gate for\r\nher and followed her in. Porter sat on the porch in the shade reading a\r\nnewspaper, and his wife stood in the doorway.\r\n\r\n“Run in and take off your things, Cynthia,” Mrs. Porter said, with a\r\nwelcoming smile. “Brother Hillhouse can sit with your pa till we call\r\ndinner. I want you to help me a little bit. Your grandmother is lying\r\ndown, and doesn’t feel well enough to come to the table.”\r\n\r\nWhen the women had gone in, and the preacher had seated himself in a\r\nrough, hide-bottomed chair near his host, Porter with a chuckle reached\r\ndown to the floor and picked up a smooth stick about twenty inches long,\r\nto the end of which was attached a piece of leather about three inches\r\nwide and four inches long.\r\n\r\n“That’s an invention o’ mine,” Porter explained proudly as he tapped\r\nhis knee with the leather. “Brother Hillhouse, ef you was to offer me a\r\nnew five-dollar note fer this thing, an’ I couldn’t git me another, I’d\r\nrefuse p’int-blank.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t say,” said Hillhouse, concentrating his attention on the\r\narticle by strong effort; “what is it for?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know any other name fer it than a ‘fly-flap,’” said Porter. “I\r\nset here one day tryin’ to read, an’ the flies made sech a dead set at my\r\nbald head that it mighty nigh driv’ me crazy. I kept fightin’ ’em with\r\nmy paper an’ knockin’ my specs off an’ losin’ my place at sech a rate\r\nthat I got to studyin’ how to git out of the difficulty, fer thar was\r\na long fly spell ahead of us. Well, I invented this thing, an’ I give\r\nyou my word it’s as good fun as goin’ a-fishin’. I kin take it in my\r\nhand—this way—an’ hold the paper too, an’ the minute one o’ the devilish\r\nthings lights on my scalp I kin give a twist o’ the wrist an’ that fly’s\r\ndone fer. You see, the leather is too flat an’ soft to hurt _me_, an’ I\r\nnever seen a fly yit that was nimble enough to git out from under it.\r\nBut my fun is mighty nigh over,” Porter went on. “Flies has got sense;\r\nthey profit by experience the same as folks does. At any rate, they seem\r\nto know thar’s a dead-fall set on my bald spot, an’ they’ve quit tryin’\r\nto lay their eggs in the root-holes _o’_ my hair. Only now and then a\r\nnewcomer is foolhardy an’ inclined to experiment. The old customers are\r\nas scared o’ my head as they are of a spider-web.”\r\n\r\n“That certainly is a rare device,” said Hillhouse. “I don’t know that I\r\never heard of one before.”\r\n\r\n“I reckon not,” the farmer returned placidly. “Somebody always has to\r\nlead out in matters of improvement. My wife an’ daughter was dead set\r\nagin me usin’ it at fust. They never looked into the workin’ of it close,\r\nan’ thought I mashed my prey on my head, but thar never was a bigger\r\nmistake. The flap don’t even puncture the skin, as tender as their hides\r\nare. I know, beca’se they always fall flat o’ their backs an’ kick\r\nawhile before givin’ up.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment Mrs. Porter came to the door and announced that dinner was\r\nready.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER V\r\n\r\nPole Baker decided to give the young people of the neighborhood a\r\ncorn-shucking. He had about fifty bushels of the grain, which he said had\r\nbeen mellowing and sweetening in the husk all the winter, and, as the\r\nmarket had advanced from sixty to seventy-five cents, he decided to sell.\r\n\r\nPole’s corn-shuckings were most enjoyable festivities. Mrs. Baker usually\r\nhad some good refreshments and the young people came from miles around.\r\nThe only drawback was that Pole seldom had much corn to husk, and the\r\nfun was over too soon. The evening chosen for the present gathering was\r\nfavored with clear moonlight and balmy weather. When Nelson Floyd walked\r\nover, after working an hour on his books at the store, he found a merry\r\ngroup in Pole’s front yard.\r\n\r\n“Yo’re jest in time,” Pole called out to him as he threw the frail gate\r\nopen for the guest to pass through. “I was afeard thar was a few more\r\npetticoats than pants to string around my pile o’ corn, but you’ll help\r\neven up. Come on, all of you, let’s mosey on down to the barn. Sally,”\r\nhe called out to his wife, a sweet-faced woman on the porch, “put them\r\nchildern to sleep an’ come on.”\r\n\r\nWith merry laughter the young men and girls made a rush in the direction\r\nof the barn. Nelson Floyd, with a sudden throbbing of the heart, had\r\nnoticed Cynthia Porter with the other girls, and as he and Baker fell in\r\nbehind, he asked:\r\n\r\n“Who came with Cynthia Porter, Pole?”\r\n\r\n“Nobody,” said Baker. “She come over jest ’fore dark by the short cut\r\nthrough the meadow. I’ll bet a hoss you are thinkin’ o’ gallivantin’ ’er\r\nback home.”\r\n\r\n“That’s what I came for,” said Floyd, with a smile.\r\n\r\n“Well, I’m sorry, for this once,” said Pole, “but I cayn’t alter my plans\r\nfer friend or foe. I don’t have but one shuckin’ a year, an’ on that\r\noccasion I’m a-goin’ to be plumb fair to all that accept my invite. You\r\nmay git what you want, but you’ll have to stand yo’r chance with the\r\nbalance. I’ll announce my rules in a minute, an’ then you’ll understand\r\nwhat I mean.”\r\n\r\nThey had now reached the great cone of corn, heaped up at the door of\r\nthe barn, and the merrymakers were dancing around it in the moonlight,\r\nclapping their hands and singing.\r\n\r\n“Halt one minute!” Pole called out peremptorily, and there was silence.\r\n“Now,” he continued, “all of you set down on the straw an’ listen to my\r\nnew rules. I’ve been studyin’ these out ever since my last shuckin’, an’\r\nthese will beat all. Now, listen! Time is a great improver, an’ we-all\r\ndon’t have to shuck corn jest like our granddaddies did. I want to make\r\nthis thing interest you, fer that pile o’ corn has to be shucked an’\r\nthrowed into the barn ’fore you leave yo’r places.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I wouldn’t preach a sermon fust,” laughed Mrs. Baker as she\r\nappeared suddenly. “Boys an’ gals that git together fer a good time don’t\r\nwant to listen to an old married man talk.”\r\n\r\n“But one married man likes to listen to _that woman_ talk, folks,” Pole\r\nbroke in, “fer her voice makes sweet music to his ear. That’s a fact,\r\ngentlemen an’ ladies; here’s one individual that could set an’ listen to\r\nthat sweet woman’s patient voice from dark to sunup, an’ then pray fer\r\nmore dark an’ more talk. I hain’t the right sort of a man to yoke to,\r\nbut she is the right sort of a woman. They hain’t all that way, though,\r\nboys, an’ I’d advise you that are worthy of a good helpmeet to think an’\r\nlook before you plunge into matrimony. Matrimony is like ice, which,\r\nuntil you bust it, may cover pure, runnin’ water or a stagnant mud-hole.\r\nBefore marriage a woman will say yes an’ no as meek as that entire bunch\r\nof females. Sugar wouldn’t melt in her mouth, but when she hooks her\r\nfish she’ll do her best to make a sucker out’n it ef it’s a brook trout\r\nat the start. I mean a certain _kind_ of a woman now, but, thank the\r\nLord, He made the other sort, too, an’ the other sort, boys, is what you\r\nort to look fer. I heard a desperate old bach say once that he believed\r\nhe’d stand a better chance o’ gettin’ a good female nature under a homely\r\nexterior than under a pretty one, an’ he was on the rampage fer a snaggle\r\ntooth; but I don’t know. A nature that’s made jest by a face won’t endure\r\none way or another long. Thar’s my little neighbor over thar; ef she\r\ndon’t combine both a purty face an’ a sweet, patient nature I’m no judge.”\r\n\r\n“Hush, Pole; Cynthia don’t want you to single her out in public that\r\na-way,” protested Mrs. Baker.\r\n\r\n“He’s simply bent on flattering more work out of me,” responded Cynthia,\r\nquite adroitly, Floyd thought, as he noted her blushes in the moonlight.\r\n“We are waiting for your rules, Mr. Baker.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” spoke up Floyd, “give us the rules, and let us go to work, and\r\nthen you can talk all you want to.”\r\n\r\n“All right, here goes. Now, you are all settin’ about the same distance\r\nfrom the pile, an’ you’ve got an equal chance. Now, the fust man or woman\r\nwho finds a red ear of corn must choose a partner to work with, an’,\r\nfurthermore, it shall be the duty o’ the man to escort the gal home, an’,\r\nin addition to that, the winnin’ man shall be entitled to kiss any gal\r\nin the crowd, an’ she hereby pledges herself to submit graceful. It’s a\r\nbang-up good rule, fer them that want to be kissed kin take a peep at the\r\near ’fore it’s shucked, an’ throw it to any man they select, an’ them\r\nthat don’t kin hope fer escape from sech an awful fate by blind luck.”\r\n\r\n“I think myself that it would be an awful fate to be kissed by a man you\r\ndidn’t care for,” laughed Mrs. Baker. “Pole has made his rules to suit\r\nthe men better than the women.”\r\n\r\n“The second rule is this,” added Pole, with a smile, “an’ that is, that\r\nwhoever finds a red ear, man or woman, I git to kiss my wife.”\r\n\r\n“Good, that’s all right!” exclaimed Floyd, and everybody laughed as they\r\nset to work. Pole sat down near Floyd, and filled and lighted his pipe.\r\n“I used to think everything was fair in a game whar gals was concerned,”\r\nhe said in an undertone. “I went to a shuckin’ once whar they had these\r\nrules, an’ I got on to exactly what I see you are on to.”\r\n\r\n“Me? What do you mean?” asked Floyd.\r\n\r\n“Why, you sly old dog, you are not shuckin’ more than one ear in every\r\nthree you pick up. You are lookin’ to see ef the silk is dark. You have\r\nfound out that a red ear always has dark silk.”\r\n\r\nFloyd laughed. “Don’t give me away, Pole. I learned that when old man\r\nScott used to send me out on frosty mornings to feed the cattle.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I won’t say nothin’,” Pole promised. “Ef money was at stake,\r\nit ’ud be different, but they say all’s fair whar war an’ women is\r\nconcerned. Besides, the sharper a man is the better he’ll provide fer\r\nthe wife he gits, an’ a man ought to be allowed to profit by his own\r\nexperience. You go ahead; ef you root a red ear out o’ that pile, old\r\nhog, I’ll count you in.”\r\n\r\nPole rose and went round the other side of the stack. There was a soft\r\nrustling sound as the husks were torn away and swept in rising billows\r\nbehind the workers, and the steady thumping of the ears as they fell\r\ninside the barn.\r\n\r\nThere was a lull in the merriment and general rustle, and Floyd heard\r\nHattie Mayhew’s clear voice say: “I know why Cynthia is so quiet. It’s\r\nbecause there wasn’t somebody here to open with prayer.”\r\n\r\nFloyd was watching Cynthia’s face, and he saw it cloud over for a\r\nmoment. She made some forced reply which he could not hear. It was Kitty\r\nWelborn’s voice that came to him on her merry laugh.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes; Cynthia has us all beaten badly!” said that little blonde. “We\r\nwore our fingers to the bones fixing up his room. Cynthia didn’t lay her\r\nhand to it, and yet he never looks at anyone else while he is preaching,\r\nand as soon as the sermon is over he rushes for her. They say Mr. Porter\r\nthinks Mr. Hillhouse is watching him, and has quit going to sleep.”\r\n\r\n“That’s a fact,” said Fred Denslow as he aimed a naked ear of corn at\r\nthe barn door and threw it. “The boys say Hillhouse will even let ’em\r\ncuss in his presence, just so they will listen to what he says about Miss\r\nCynthia.”\r\n\r\n“That isn’t fair to Miss Cynthia,” Nelson Floyd observed suddenly. “I’m\r\nafraid you are making it too hot for her over on that side, so I’m going\r\nto invite her over here. You see, I have found the first red ear of corn,\r\nand it’s big enough to count double.”\r\n\r\nThere was a general shout and clapping of hands as he held it up to\r\nview in the moonlight. He put it into the pocket of his coat as he rose\r\nand moved round toward Cynthia. Bending down to her, he said: “Come on;\r\nyou’ve got to obey the rules of the game, you know.”\r\n\r\nShe allowed him to draw her to her feet.\r\n\r\n“Now fer the fust act!” Pole Baker cried out. “I hain’t a-goin’ to have\r\nno bashful corn-shuckers. Ef you balk or kick over a trace, I’ll leave\r\nyou out next time, shore.”\r\n\r\n“You didn’t make a thoroughly fair rule, Pole,” said Floyd. “The days of\r\nwoman slavery are past. I shall not take advantage of the situation.”\r\n\r\nEverybody laughed as Floyd led her round to his place and raked up a pile\r\nof shucks for her to sit on.\r\n\r\n“Well, there ought to have been another rule,” laughed Fred Denslow, “an’\r\nthat to the effect that if the winning man, through sickness, lack of\r\nbackbone or sudden death, is prevented from takin’ the prize, somebody\r\nelse ought to have a chance. Here I’ve been workin’ like a cornfield\r\nnigger to win, and now see the feller heaven has smiled on throwin’ that\r\nsort of a flower away. Good gracious, what’s the world comin’ to?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’ll have _mine_,” Pole Baker was heard to say, and he took his\r\nlittle wife in his arms and kissed her tenderly.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nRefreshments had been served, the last ear of corn was husked and thrown\r\ninto the barn, and they had all risen to depart, when Hillhouse came down\r\nthe path from the cottage. He was panting audibly, and had evidently been\r\nwalking fast. He shook hands hurriedly with Pole and his wife, and then\r\nturned to Cynthia.\r\n\r\n“I’m just from your house,” he said, “and I promised your mother to come\r\nover after you. I was afraid I’d be late. The distance never seemed so\r\nlong before.”\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid you _are_ too late,” said Floyd, with a cold smile. “I was\r\nlucky enough to find the first red ear of corn, and the reward was that I\r\nmight take home anyone I asked. I assure you I’ll see that Miss Cynthia\r\nis well taken care of.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! I—I see.” The preacher seemed stunned by the disappointment. “I\r\ndidn’t know; I thought——”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Floyd has won fast enough,” said Pole, “an’ he’s acted the part\r\nof the gentleman all through.” Pole explained what Floyd had done in\r\nexcusing Cynthia from the principal forfeit he had won.\r\n\r\nHillhouse seemed unable to reply. The young people were moving toward the\r\nhouse, and he fell behind Floyd and his partner, walking along with the\r\nothers and saying nothing.\r\n\r\nIt was a lonely, shaded road which Floyd and Cynthia traversed to reach\r\nher house.\r\n\r\n“My luck turned just in the nick of time,” Floyd said exultantly. “I went\r\nthere, little girl, especially to talk with you, and I was mad enough to\r\nfight when I saw how Pole had arranged everything. Then by good fortune\r\nand cheating I found that red ear; and—well, here we are. I never wanted\r\nto see anyone so badly in my life. Really, I——”\r\n\r\n“Stop, don’t begin that!” Cynthia suddenly commanded, and she turned her\r\neyes upon him steadily.\r\n\r\n“Stop? Why do you say that?”\r\n\r\n“Because,” retorted she, “you talk that way to all the girls, and I don’t\r\nwant to hear it.”\r\n\r\nFloyd laughed. “You know I mean what I say,” he replied. “You know it;\r\nyou are just talking to hear your sweet, musical voice. Keep on; I could\r\nlisten all night.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’m sure I don’t like you when you speak that way,” the girl said\r\nseriously. “It sounds insincere—it makes me doubt you more than anything\r\nelse.”\r\n\r\n“Then some things about me don’t make you doubt me,” he said, with\r\ntentative eagerness.\r\n\r\nShe was silent for a moment, then she nodded her head. “I’ll admit that\r\nsome things I hear of you make me admire you—that is, in a way.”\r\n\r\n“Please tell me what they are,” he said, with a laugh.\r\n\r\n“I’ve heard, for one thing, of your being very good and kind to poor\r\npeople—people that Mr. Mayhew would have turned out of their homes for\r\ndebt if you hadn’t interfered.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, that was only business, little girl,” Floyd laughed. “I can simply\r\nsee farther than the old man can. He thought they never would be able to\r\npay, but I knew they would some day, and, also, that they would come up\r\nwith the back interest.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe it!” the girl said firmly. “Those things make me rather\r\nlike you, while the others make me—they make me—afraid.”\r\n\r\n“Afraid? Oh, how absurd—how very absurd!” They had reached a spring which\r\nflowed from a great bed of rocks in the side of a rugged hill. He pointed\r\nto a flat stone quite near it. “Do you remember the first time I ever had\r\na talk with you? It was while we were seated on this rock.”\r\n\r\nShe recalled it, but only nodded her head.\r\n\r\n“It was a year ago,” he went on. “You had on a pink dress and wore your\r\nhair like a little girl, in a plait down your back. Cynthia, you were\r\nthe prettiest creature I had ever seen. I could hardly talk to you for\r\nwondering over your dazzling beauty. You are even more beautiful now; you\r\nhave ripened physically and mentally—grown to be a wonderful woman.”\r\n\r\nHe sat down on the stone, still holding to her hand, and drawing her\r\ntoward him.\r\n\r\nShe hesitated, looking back toward Baker’s cottage.\r\n\r\n“Sit down, little girl,” he entreated her. “I’m tired. I’ve worked hard\r\nall day at the store, and that corn-shucking wasn’t the best thing to\r\ntaper off on.”\r\n\r\nShe hesitated an instant longer, and then allowed him to draw her down\r\nbeside him.\r\n\r\n“There, now,” he said, “that’s more like it.” He still held her hand; it\r\nlay warm, pulsating and helpless in his strong grasp.\r\n\r\n“Do you know why I did not kiss you back there?” he asked suddenly.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know why you didn’t, but it was good of you,” she answered.\r\n\r\n“No, it wasn’t,” he laughed. “I don’t want credit for what I don’t\r\ndeserve. I simply put it off, little girl—I put it off. I knew we would\r\nbe alone on our way home, and that you would not refuse me.”\r\n\r\n“But I shall!” she said. “I’m not going to let you kiss me here\r\nin—in—this way.”\r\n\r\n“Then you’ll not be keeping your part of the contract,” he said,\r\ntightening his grasp on her hand. “I’ve always considered you so fair in\r\neverything; and, Cynthia, you don’t know how much I want to kiss you.\r\nNo, you won’t refuse me—you can’t!” His left arm was behind her, and it\r\nencircled her waist. She made an effort to draw herself erect, but he\r\ndrew her closer to him. Her head sank upon his shoulder and lay there\r\nwhile he pressed his lips to hers.\r\n\r\nThen she sat up, and firmly pushed his arm down from her waist.\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry I let you do it,” she said, under her breath.\r\n\r\n“But why, darling?”\r\n\r\n“Because I’ve said a thousand times that I would not; but I have—I\r\n_have_, and I shall hate myself always.”\r\n\r\n“When you have made me the happiest fellow in the state?” Floyd said.\r\n“Don’t go!” he urged.\r\n\r\nShe had risen and turned toward her home. He walked beside her, suiting\r\nhis step to hers.\r\n\r\n“Do you remember the night we sat and talked in the grape-arbor at your\r\nhouse?” he asked. “Well, you never knew it, but I’ve been there three\r\nnights within the last month, hoping that I’d get to see you by some\r\nchance or other. I always work late on my accounts, and when I am through\r\nand the weather is fine, I walk to your house, climb over the fence,\r\nslip through the orchard, and sit in that arbor, trying to imagine you\r\nare there with me. I often see a light in your room, and the last time\r\nI became so desperate that I actually whistled for you. This way.” He\r\nput his thumb and little finger between his lips and made an imitation\r\nof a whippoorwill’s call. “You see, no one could tell that from the real\r\nthing. If you ever hear that sound from the grape-arbor, you’ll know I\r\nneed you, little girl, and you must not disappoint me.”\r\n\r\n“I’d never respond to it,” Cynthia said firmly. “The idea of such a\r\nthing!”\r\n\r\n“But you know I can’t go to your house often, with your mother opposing\r\nmy visits as she does, and when I’m there she never leaves us alone. No,\r\nI must have you to myself once in awhile, little woman, and you must help\r\nme. Remember, if I call you, I’ll want you badly.”\r\n\r\nHe whistled again, and the echo came back on the still air from a nearby\r\nhillside. They were passing a log cabin which stood a few yards from the\r\nroadside.\r\n\r\n“Budd Crow moved there today,” Cynthia said, as if desirous of changing\r\nthe subject. “He rented twenty acres from my father. The White Caps\r\nwhipped him a week ago, for being lazy and not working for his family.\r\nHis wife came over and told me all about it. She said it really had\r\nbrought him to his senses, but that it had broken her heart. She cried\r\nwhile she was talking to me. Why does God afflict some women with men of\r\nthat kind, and make others the wives of governors and Presidents?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, there you are beyond my philosophic depth, Cynthia! You mustn’t\r\nbother your pretty head about those things. I sometimes rail against\r\nmy fate for giving me the ambition of a king, while I do not even know\r\nwho—But I think you know what I mean!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I think I do,” said the girl sympathetically, “and some day I\r\nbelieve all that will be cleared up. Some coarse natures wouldn’t care a\r\nstraw about it, but you _do_ care, and it is the things we want and can’t\r\nget that count.”\r\n\r\n“It is strange,” he said thoughtfully, “but of late I always think of\r\nmy mother as being young and beautiful. I think of her, too, as being\r\nwell-bred and educated. I think all those things without any proof even\r\nas to what her maiden name was or where she came from—Are you still\r\nunhappy at home, Cynthia?”\r\n\r\n“Nearly all the time,” the girl sighed. “As she grows older my mother\r\nseems more faultfinding and suspicious than ever. Then she has set her\r\nmind on my marrying Mr. Hillhouse. They seem to be working together to\r\nthat end, and it is very tiresome to me.”\r\n\r\n“I’m glad you don’t love him,” Floyd said. “I don’t think he could make\r\nanyone of your nature happy.”\r\n\r\nThe girl stared into his eyes. They had reached the gate of the\r\nfarmhouse, and he opened it for her.\r\n\r\n“Now, good night,” he said, pressing her hand. “Remember, if you ever\r\nhear a lonely whippoorwill calling, that he is longing for companionship.”\r\n\r\nShe leaned over the gate, drawing it toward her till the latch clicked in\r\nits catch. She was thinking of the hot kiss he had pressed upon her lips,\r\nand what he might later think about it.\r\n\r\n“I’ll never meet you there at night,” she said firmly. “My mother does\r\nnot treat me right, but I shall not do that when she is asleep. You may\r\ncome to see me here once in awhile if you wish.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I shall sit alone in the arbor,” he returned, with a low laugh,\r\n“and I hope your hard heart will keep you awake.”\r\n\r\nShe opened the front door, which was never locked, and went into her room\r\non the right of the little hall. The night was very still, and down the\r\nroad she heard Floyd’s whippoorwill call growing fainter and fainter as\r\nhe strode away. She found a match and lighted the lamp on her bureau, and\r\nlooked at her reflection in the little oval-shaped mirror. Instinctively\r\nshe shuddered and brushed her lips with her hand as she remembered his\r\nembrace.\r\n\r\n“He’ll despise me,” she muttered. “He’ll think I am weak like all the\r\nrest, but I am not. _I am not!_ I’ll show him that he can’t—and yet”—her\r\nhead sank to her hands, which were folded on the top of the bureau—“I\r\ncouldn’t help it. My God, I couldn’t help it! I must have wanted—no, I\r\ndidn’t. I didn’t!”\r\n\r\nThere was a soft step in the hall. The door of her room creaked like the\r\nlow scream of a cat. A figure in white stood on the threshold. It was\r\nMrs. Porter in her nightdress, her feet bare, her iron-gray half-twisted\r\nhair hanging upon her shoulders.\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t go to sleep, Cynthia,” she said, “till I knew you were safe\r\nat home.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’m here all right, mother; so go back to bed, and don’t catch\r\nyour death of cold.”\r\n\r\nThe old woman moved across the room to Cynthia’s bed and sat down on it.\r\n“I heard you coming down the road and went to the front window. I had\r\nsent Brother Hillhouse for you, but it was Nelson Floyd who brought you\r\nhome. Didn’t Brother Hillhouse get there before you left?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but I had already promised Mr. Floyd.”\r\n\r\nThe old woman met her daughter’s glance steadily. “I suppose all I’ll do\r\nor say won’t amount to anything. Cynthia, you know what I’m afraid of.”\r\n\r\nCynthia stood straight, her face set and white, her great dreamy eyes\r\nflashing.\r\n\r\n“Yes, and that’s the insult of it, mother. I tell you, you will drive me\r\ntoo far. A girl at a certain time of her life wants a mother’s love and\r\nsympathy; she doesn’t want threats, fears and disgraceful suspicions.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Porter covered her face with her bony hands and groaned aloud.\r\n\r\n“You are confessing,” she said, “that you are tied an’ bound to him by\r\nthe heart, and that there isn’t anything left for you but the crumbs he\r\nlets fall from his profligate table.”\r\n\r\n“Stop!” Cynthia sprang to her mother and laid her small hand heavily on\r\nthe thin shoulder. “Stop! You know you are telling a deliberate—” She\r\npaused, turned and went slowly back to the bureau. “God forgive me! God\r\nhelp me remember my duty to you as my mother. You’re old; you’re out of\r\nyour head!”\r\n\r\n“There, you said something.” The old woman had drawn herself erect and\r\nsat staring at her daughter, her hands on her sharp knees. “You know my\r\nsister Martha got to worryin’ when she was along about my age over her\r\nlawsuit matters, and kept it up till her brain gave way. Folks always\r\nsaid she and I were alike. Dr. Strong has told me time after time to\r\nguard against worry, or I’d go out and kill myself as she did. I haven’t\r\nmentioned this before, but I will now. I can’t keep down my fears and\r\nsuspicions while the very air is full of that man’s doings. He’s a devil.\r\nYour pretty face has caught his fancy, and your holding him off, so far,\r\nhas made him determined to crush you like a plucked flower. Why don’t he\r\ngo to the Duncans, and the Prices, and lay his plans? Because the men\r\nof those families shoot at the drop of the hat. He knows your pa is not\r\nof that stamp, and that you haven’t any men kin to defend our honor. He\r\nhasn’t any of his own; nobody knows who or what he is.”\r\n\r\n“Mother!” Cynthia’s tone had softened. Her face was filling with sudden\r\npity for the quivering creature on the bed. “Mother, will you not have\r\nconfidence in me? If I promise you faithfully to take care of myself\r\nwith him, and make him understand what and who I am, won’t that satisfy\r\nyou? Even men with bad reputations have a good side to their natures,\r\nand they often reach a point at which they reform. I well know there are\r\nstrong women and weak women. Mother, I’m not a weak woman. As God is my\r\njudge, I’m able to take care of myself. It pains me to say this, for you\r\nought to know it; you ought to feel it, see it in my eye and hear it in\r\nmy voice. Now, go to bed and sleep. I’m really afraid you may lose your\r\nmind, since you told me about Aunt Martha.”\r\n\r\nThe face of the old woman changed; it lighted up with hope.\r\n\r\n“Somehow, I believe what you say,” she said, with a faint smile. “Anyway,\r\nI’ll try not to worry any more.” She rose and went to the door. “Yes,\r\nI’ll try not to worry any more,” she repeated. “It may all come out\r\nright.”\r\n\r\nWhen she found herself alone Cynthia turned and looked at her reflection\r\nin the glass.\r\n\r\n“He didn’t once tell me in so many words that he loved me,” she said. “He\r\nhas never used that word. He has never said that he wanted to mar—” She\r\nbroke off, staring into the depths of her own great, troubled eyes. “And\r\nyet I let him kiss me—_me_!” A hot flush filled her neck and face and\r\nspread to the roots of her hair. Then suddenly she blew out the light and\r\ncrept to her bed.\r\n\r\n                          (_To be continued._)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _The Conservative of Today_\r\n\r\n                        BY JOHN H. GIRDNER, M.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nEver since we have had a record of the human race it has been divided\r\ninto two parties, the _conservative_ and the _radical_. These two parties\r\nhave ever battled with each other for possession of the world. Strictly\r\nspeaking, all history—sacred and profane—is nothing else than a record of\r\nthis world-old struggle.\r\n\r\n“That which _is_, was made by God,” cries the conservative.\r\n\r\n“God is leaving _that_ and is entering _this other_,” replies the radical.\r\n\r\nThese have been the battle-cries of mankind all down the ages. The\r\nconservative has always been the stand-patter. He has been always on the\r\ndefensive, explaining, apologizing, opposing and pleading that change\r\nwould result in deterioration. The conservative must bear the vice, the\r\nsins and crimes of the society of his time, and, bending under the load,\r\npiteously pleads for delay, for compromise. He preaches the pusillanimous\r\ndoctrine of “let us bear the evils we already have rather than fly to\r\nthose we know not of.” Conservatism never made an invention, wrote a\r\npoem, painted a picture nor breathed a prayer that rose above the roof.\r\n\r\nPharaoh, King of Egypt, was a conservative. He stood pat on keeping the\r\nHebrew nation in slavery, against the radicalism of Moses. The Roman\r\nempire was conservative. It stood pat on its pagan worship, against the\r\nradicalism of the new religion. The scientific world stood pat on the\r\nthen accepted doctrine that the “sun do move,” against the radicalism\r\nof Galileo that it is the earth that does the moving. King George was\r\na conservative. He stood pat on America’s remaining a British colony,\r\nagainst the radicalism of Washington and the Continental Congress. The\r\nFrench King, Louis XVI, was a conservative, and stood pat against the\r\nradicalism of the people of France when they demanded liberty and bread.\r\nThe Czar of Russia and his titled aristocracy are conservatives. They are\r\nstanding pat against progress, enlightenment and justice among the masses\r\nof the people of that unhappy country. But it is about the conservatives\r\nof our own country that I want to write. I want to say a word about our\r\nown stand-patters.\r\n\r\nWebster’s Dictionary says that a _conservative_ is, “One who desires\r\nto maintain existing institutions and customs.” A conservative in the\r\nUnited States today, then, is a man who wants the Beef Trust to continue\r\nto force the farmer to accept its price for his cattle, and the consumer\r\nto pay its price for dressed beef. A conservative is a man who wants\r\nthe railroads to continue giving rebates to favored shippers, and to\r\nhold them from unfavored shippers. A conservative is a man who wants\r\nthe United States Senate to continue to be composed of men who do not\r\nrepresent the masses of the people of their respective states, but\r\nwho represent the corporations. For instance, a conservative in New\r\nYork State is a man who wants Chauncey M. Depew and Thomas C. Platt to\r\ncontinue in the United States Senate.\r\n\r\nDepew represents the Vanderbilt system of railroads, while Platt\r\nrepresents the United States Express Company. The two will oppose any\r\nlegislation which interferes with the income of their corporations, never\r\nmind what the people of the state or nation want. The people have for\r\nyears wanted a parcels post in this country. England and other countries\r\nhave it, but we cannot. Why? Because Platt is in the Senate, and also\r\nin the parcel-carrying business. You, Mr. Conservative, put him in the\r\nSenate and you keep him there.\r\n\r\nWe have what is called a protective tariff in this country. It is a\r\nlaw which, in the name of _protecting_ the workingman, _robs_ him and\r\nevery other consumer. If you are a conservative, you are in favor of\r\nmaintaining this law.\r\n\r\nThe tariff schedule was drawn up by a committee of Congress _behind\r\nclosed doors_. That is, the doors were closed on those who have to _pay_\r\nthe tariff, but open to those who were to be _benefited_ by it. The\r\ncommittee sent for the manufacturers of the various necessary articles\r\nwhich people use, and asked _them_ how much of a tax _they wanted_ on\r\nsimilar articles made abroad. And the manufacturers wrote these schedules\r\nfor the committee, and they were adopted. Notice, the consumers, the\r\npeople who have to pay the tariff, were not invited to appear before this\r\ncommittee. Only the manufacturers, who are the beneficiaries, were taken\r\ninto counsel.\r\n\r\nIf you are a conservative—that is, if you are a stand-patter, you are in\r\nfavor of continuing and “maintaining” this “mother of trusts.”\r\n\r\nSometimes laboring-men become dissatisfied with their wages, or the\r\nnumber of hours they are made to work, and they exercise their God-given\r\nright to cease work, or go on strike. Then the corporations rush to the\r\ncourts and secure injunctions, restraining the strikers from doing all\r\nsorts of things. In some instances these injunctions are obtained and\r\nserved on the strikers before any of the acts from which the injunctions\r\nrestrain them have been committed or attempted. Special deputy sheriffs\r\nand Pinkerton men are hurried to the scene of the strike. The state\r\nmilitia is ordered out, and in one instance Federal troops were sent\r\nto Chicago. At Homestead the hired deputy-sheriff-Cossacks shot down\r\npeaceable workmen, just as real Cossacks shot down the peaceable\r\nworkmen who marched with Father Gapon in the streets of St. Petersburg\r\nrecently—and for no better reason. Martial law has been declared,\r\ncourt-martial has been substituted for trial by jury. The right of\r\nhabeas corpus has been suspended. Members of labor unions have been\r\nthrown into prison without trial; others have been torn from their homes\r\nand deported to other states without process of law, and bull pens\r\nestablished for guarding prisoners. These things have been happening in\r\nthe United States for years. In each instance it was claimed that such\r\narbitrary measures were necessary to preserve order, keep the peace,\r\nprotect the property of the corporations, and to enforce the injunctions\r\nissued by the courts—_when these injunctions were directed against the\r\nlaboring or producing class_. Now see how differently things work when a\r\ncorporation is at the dangerous end of an injunction gun.\r\n\r\nThe United States Federal Court, through Judge Grosscup, of Chicago,\r\nissued on February 18, 1903, an injunction restraining the Beef Trust\r\nfrom continuing to do certain things. The Beef Trust paid _no_ attention\r\nto this injunction. It went right on doing these same things, just as if\r\nJudge Grosscup had not issued his injunction. It went right on despoiling\r\nthe bank accounts of the consumers of beef and the raisers of cattle.\r\nNo special deputy sheriffs were sworn in, no state militia was ordered\r\nout, no Federal troops were sent to Chicago or anywhere else to enforce\r\nobedience to _this_ injunction. Armour, Swift and Morris, the men said\r\nto be at the head of the Beef Trust, were not arrested. No bull pen was\r\nestablished. Nobody was deported.\r\n\r\nThis is the existing custom of enforcing and _not_ enforcing Federal\r\nCourt injunctions. Now if you are a conservative, you are, according to\r\nWebster, one who desires to “maintain” this custom.\r\n\r\nAt the present time the lighting corporation, the railroad corporation,\r\nthe telephone corporation and the city or municipal corporation are all\r\nexploiting the people of New York City as they have never been exploited\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nNever in the history of New York have its public servants been\r\nso absolutely and completely _owned_ by so-called public service\r\ncorporations as at present. These corporations have literally taken\r\nover the people’s municipal corporation, merged it with their own and\r\nimpressed their management upon it. For instance, Dr. Darlington,\r\nPresident of the Health Department, goes to Washington to urge Congress\r\nto pass a law to destroy dirty money, because it is a means of\r\nconveying disease germs. But he does not destroy or clean the filthy\r\ndisease-bearing car straps in New York. Why? Because August Belmont\r\nand H. H. Vreeland won’t let him. Darlington is in the position of the\r\nIrishman who would free Ireland but for the police. The people want the\r\nsigns, slot machines, etc., put out of their Subway stations, but they\r\ncan’t get it done. Why? Because the Interborough Corporation is stronger\r\nthan the municipal corporation. The people’s public servants in New York\r\nCity have become the servants of the public service corporations.\r\n\r\nIt does seem that even men who call themselves conservatives in New York\r\nwould rise up next fall and stamp the life out of this condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _Casus Belli_\r\n\r\n\r\n“Now, the trusts—” began the patent-churn man, addressing the\r\nwashing-machine agent. “The trusts, let me tell you, are——”\r\n\r\n“Here, now, gentlemen!” remonstrated the landlord of the tavern at\r\nPolkville, Ark. “That’s what the fight here yesterday started about; and\r\nit’s goin’ to cost me three or four dollars for new window glass, alone!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _A Character Study of Byron and Burns_\r\n\r\n                       BY ELIZABETH BAILEY TRAYLOR\r\n\r\n\r\nThese names are live wires in the lands of the Scotch heather and the\r\nEnglish rose, and equally so here by the red hearts of the watermelons\r\nand the snow showers of the cotton-fields of the Southern States. One\r\noften hears it said of those devoted brotherhoods—the Burns Clubs and the\r\nScotch Societies—“Their Bible is Robbie Burns.” Frank Stanton has a large\r\nhearing when he sings:\r\n\r\n    We’ll slip away from our today\r\n      Of wonder and of worry,\r\n    To where, in meadows of the may,\r\n      He whistled “Annie Laurie.”\r\n    To meet him in some gabled inn,\r\n      And pass the rare decanter,\r\n    Or in some ingle nook begin\r\n      A race with “Tam o’Shanter.”\r\n\r\nTo a large coterie of kindred spirits the name of Byron evokes a pageant\r\nof ideas pulsating with life’s strongest emotions. It is told of a\r\npleasure club that they recently abandoned the books of the day and read\r\nthe poet exhaustively and with great enthusiasm—no slight tribute to his\r\ngenius in a time of unremitting demand for that which is palpitant with\r\nthe breath of today’s life. A learned minister from his pulpit says:\r\n“‘The Destruction of Sennacherib’ is a marvel of diction and technique,\r\nand no divine has approached the narrative in its exact correspondence to\r\nHoly Writ.”\r\n\r\nA bare sketch of these two philosophers may suggest to book-lovers in\r\ngeneral the particular period of the culture-epochs dominating each\r\ncareer, and discover some of the forces of heredity and environment which\r\nproduced these characters, vibrant with full, fresh, free life, or reveal\r\nto readers equipped by psychical research for judgment how it was that\r\nthese natures furnished the battleground for so fierce a conflict of\r\ngood and evil forces.\r\n\r\nAccording to Carlyle, the father of Burns was a “man of thoughtful,\r\nintense character, possessing some knowledge and open-minded for more,\r\nof keen insight and devout heart, friendly and fearless; a fully\r\nunfolded man seldom found in any rank of society.” Of his ancestry we\r\nknow nothing. The father of Byron was an Englishman, from a line of\r\nillustrious ancestors reaching back to the days of William the Conqueror.\r\n\r\nThe mother of Burns, devout of heart and calm of mind, brightened the\r\nlives of her children with the ballads of her beloved Scotland. The\r\nmother of Byron would smother him with kisses one moment, and the next\r\ncall him a lame brat.\r\n\r\nBoth poets spent their early youth in Scotland, where the record of\r\ntheir school days is still preserved in their respective parishes. Burns\r\nread with equal avidity Taylor’s devotional works, Locke, Pope, Milton,\r\nThomson and Young. He never minded work, if knowledge was the reward.\r\nByron was devoted to the reading of history and poetry, and was at the\r\nhead of many college rows. When, in conformity to the custom of the\r\nschool, the order was so inverted as to make the boy of highest rank\r\nchange places with the lowest, the teacher would call out to Byron: “Now,\r\nGeorge, let us see how quick you will be foot again.”\r\n\r\nEach had a favorite family servant. Byron wrote often to his old nurse\r\nof his triumphs in London. Burns says many of his songs were inspired\r\nby an old servant, Jenny Wilson, as she repeated her endless collection\r\nof songs and stories of devils, ghosts, fairies, witches, warlocks,\r\nkelpies, elf-candles and enchanted dragons.\r\n\r\nLady Blessington wrote of Byron’s appearance: “He is not tall, as I had\r\nfancied him. His appearance is, however, highly prepossessing; his head\r\nis finely shaped and the forehead open, high and noble, his eyes are\r\ngray and full of expression, his mouth is the most remarkable feature,\r\nthe upper lip of Grecian shortness and the corners descending, the lips\r\nfull and finely cut. In speaking, he shows his teeth very much, and they\r\nare white and even, but I observed that even in his smile—he smiles\r\nfrequently—there is something of a scornful expression that is evidently\r\nnatural. His countenance is full of expression and changes with the\r\nsubject of conversation; it gains on the beholder the more it is seen,\r\nand leaves an agreeable impression. His voice and accent are peculiarly\r\nagreeable, clear, harmonious and so distinct that, though his general\r\ntone in speaking is rather low than high, not a word is lost.”\r\n\r\nBurns, tall, well formed and graceful, was always a charming presence.\r\nThe beautiful and all-accomplished Duchess of Gordon said that Burns was\r\nthe most fascinating guest she ever saw entertained.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the portrait by Alexander Nasmyth, Sir Walter Scott says:\r\n“This is the best likeness of Burns, but his features, as I remember\r\nthem, were still more massive and imposing than they are represented\r\nin this picture. There was a strong expression of shrewdness in\r\nhis lineaments, the eyes alone indicating the poetic character and\r\ntemperament. They were large and dark and literally glowed when he spoke\r\nwith feeling or interest. I never saw such eyes in any other head.”\r\n\r\nAttired always in the tip of the fashion, Byron was a drawing-room dude\r\nin the smart set of London. The dress of Burns was coarse and homely,\r\nmade from his own sheep, carded by his own fire. His plaid was red and\r\nwhite, woven with great pride by his mother and sister. His home and the\r\nhomes of his friends, were low-thatched cottages, consisting of kitchen\r\nand bedrooms, with floors of kneaded clay.\r\n\r\nIf the former set a fashion for collars which lasts to this good day, the\r\nlatter has left us the Tam-o’-Shanter hat.\r\n\r\nBurns was essentially musical, having begun his career by setting music\r\nto the verses of another.\r\n\r\nByron, in a luxurious salon, wooed and won a woman of fashion. Burns\r\ngives this account of his courtship with Highland Mary,\r\n\r\n    Who was snatched away in beauty’s bloom:\r\n\r\n“We plighted our troth on the Sabbath to make it more sacred, seated by\r\na running brook, that Nature might be a witness, over an open Bible, to\r\nshow we remembered God in the compact.”\r\n\r\nAfter a second edition of “Poems by an Ayrshire Plowman,” Burns spent the\r\nwinter in Edinburgh, where he was the lion of the elegant coteries of the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nLords, ladies, men of letters, all with manners highly polished by\r\nattrition, found in him a barbarian who was not barbarous. As the poet\r\nmet in at least one lord feelings as natural as those of a plowman, so\r\nthey met in a plowman manners worthy of a lord.\r\n\r\nDugald Stewart writes: “His manner was easy and unperplexed; his address\r\nwas perfectly well-bred and elegant in its simplicity; he felt neither\r\neclipsed by the titled nor embarrassed before the learned and eloquent,\r\nbut took his station with the ease of one born to it.”\r\n\r\nEach poet had a brief political career. As exciseman for several years\r\nit was necessary for Burns to ride over two hundred miles per week, thus\r\ncoming constantly in contact with the people. In this public service he\r\nmade a record for being thorough, correct and at the same time humane.\r\n\r\nByron made as serious an effort in politics as was possible to his\r\nimpetuous and headlong nature. After many hindrances he was granted a\r\nseat in the House of Lords. He traveled awhile, and, returning, made two\r\nor three speeches before the House. Between times he would correct the\r\nproof-sheets of “Childe Harold.” The publication of this poem put an end\r\nto his parliamentary ambitions. “When ‘Childe Harold’ was published,”\r\nhe says, “no one ever afterward thought of my prose, nor indeed did I.”\r\nHowever, he also says, “I would not for the world be like my hero.”\r\n\r\nEach spent much time alone with Nature, drinking from the exhaustless\r\nfountain of her varied life. Each loved her most in her wildest,\r\nfiercest moods. Power—they loved it, worshiped it; they felt it in them\r\nand all around them. It was the necessary food for their strenuous,\r\ntempest-tossed souls. Burns loved to walk on the sheltered side of a\r\nforest and listen to a storm rave among the trees. Better still, he loved\r\nto ascend some eminence and stride along its summit amid the flashes of\r\nthe lightning and howls of the tempest: “Rapt in enthusiasm, I seemed to\r\nascend to Him who walks on the wings of the wind.” Byron\r\n\r\n    Made him friends of mountains, stars;\r\n    But the Quick Spirit of the universe\r\n\r\nspoke to him best through Nature’s most stupendous form, the turbulent,\r\nmerciless ocean.\r\n\r\nByron reveled in the glories of more climes; Burns saw the marvels of\r\nmore kingdoms, for he understood the language of the daisy and the mouse.\r\nThe self-negating love, the exultant pride the Peasant Poet felt for his\r\nown bonnie Scotland, the English Peer lavished upon a foreign land. Burns\r\nsaid if he ever reached heaven, he would ask nothing better than just a\r\nHighland welcome.\r\n\r\nBurns, in his innate appreciation of the dignity of humanity, is\r\nsomething of a Siegfried, with the fearless spirit of the forest vocal\r\nwith the song of birds, the aroma of blossoming shrubs, the play of the\r\nwaterfall and the restful stretch of meadows with their daisies and\r\nheather.\r\n\r\nByron, in the desolation of his youth, in his extremes of laughter and\r\ntears, in his yearning for sympathy, in his broodings over the mysteries\r\nof life, played the character of Hamlet with the world for a stage,\r\nleaving a kindred problem for the wonder of mankind.\r\n\r\nMany of Byron’s shorter poems are from Bible stories and characters,\r\nand it is wonderful how his brilliant genius caught and reproduced both\r\nspirit and story. Burns gives us his thought of a religious life in that\r\nsweetest pastoral poem in all literature, “The Cotter’s Saturday Night.”\r\n\r\nIn the last few months of his life he did much to reproduce it in his own\r\nlife, holding family prayer with such earnestness as to bring his hearers\r\nto tears over the penitence for sins and hope in the mercy of God.\r\n\r\nIn these poets the perceptive faculties roamed at will over a wide\r\nfield of human activities, and voiced their impressions with a witchery\r\nof language which has hardly a parallel. The work of both men was\r\nrevolutionizing in its effects. Burns found his countrymen in bondage to\r\nthe fear of wraiths, hobgoblins and kindred spirits, and he was a mighty\r\npower in their deliverance. Taine estimates that he was as great a force\r\nin Scotland as the Revolution in France.\r\n\r\nByron is believed largely to have influenced the revolutionary movement\r\nin Germany. He gave a direct stimulus to the liberators of Italy, and\r\nended his life in a heroic struggle for the liberties of Greece.\r\n\r\nIf Byron’s literary work is more resplendent and daring, Burns’s seems\r\nfresher from the varied living forces about us. If Byron’s is a circlet\r\nof sapphires, Burns’s is that same circlet transmuted by the alchemy of\r\nhuman sympathy to a wreath of never-fading violets.\r\n\r\nWhen we remember that these colossal figures passed off the stage of life\r\nafter thirty-seven short years, when we get a suggestion of the difficult\r\ncircumstances and terrible temptations that encompassed their stormy\r\nyoung lives, we may well leave their failings to God, who alone is their\r\nmoral Judge. It may be His compassion for them is commensurate with the\r\npowers with which He endowed them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _The Man With White Nails_\r\n\r\n                   BY CAPTAIN W. E. P. FRENCH, U.S.A.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy wife brought me the case and the client, and, strict candor compels\r\nme to say, I was not particularly grateful for either. The case was a\r\ncuriously involved combination of an over-indulgent, invalid mother;\r\na shrewd, selfish and unscrupulous son; a trained nurse, rather\r\nworse than she should have been; a cleverly drawn but very unjust\r\nwill; an exceedingly large estate mostly in investment securities; a\r\nhusband-deserted daughter with two small children and “an annual income\r\nof nothing to keep ’em on”; a witness who would undoubtedly be “agin the\r\ngovernment,” and one other person whose testimony might, or might not, be\r\nfavorable to the prosecution, but who had apparently vanished bodily from\r\nthe face of the earth. The client was a pretty, gentle little creature,\r\ncrushed under a load of trouble much too big for her, quite pathetic in\r\nher helplessness, and shrinking and rather indifferent about her own\r\nclaims, but with an almost fierce mother-instinct over the rights of her\r\nbabies.\r\n\r\nHow the partner of my joys and sorrows discovered these wronged mites of\r\nhumanity is immaterial—she has a keen scent for injustice or oppression\r\nof any kind—but she rounded them up, brought them to my office, and said\r\nI was to take the case. I never appeal from the decision of my supreme\r\ncourt, so I said, “Certainly.”\r\n\r\nFirst she took me aside and gave me an _ex parte_ and rather highly\r\ncolored statement of the facts in the affair, explaining that her\r\nprotégée was diffident and reticent, unless stirred up about the\r\nchildren, and perorating with the remark, “You will find, John, that my\r\nmeek-looking lamb is quite a ferocious animal when roused.” Then she went\r\nover to the other woman, kissed her, gave the boy a pile of my cherished\r\nlaw-books to use as building-blocks, took the tiny girl on her lap,\r\nhitched her chair a bit closer to the mother and said, “Now, my dear, you\r\ntell John everything, just as you told it to me, and he will fix it all\r\nup for you.”\r\n\r\nA tolerable portion of my fairly large practice has consisted, and, I\r\nfancy, will continue to consist, of charity cases brought to me by my\r\nwife. They have, of course, seldom or never been profitable; they have\r\ncost time, work, worry and money, have occasionally been paid in the base\r\ncoin of ingratitude, and without them we should have had a much larger\r\nbank account. But the warmest-hearted and most generous woman I have ever\r\nknown likes me to help those she thinks are wronged, and it is little\r\nenough for me to do for her dear sake.\r\n\r\nMy small, scared client attracted me from the first, and my dusty legal\r\nheart ached over her sad story. Her mother had never cared much for\r\nher and had lavished love and money on her brother. She had married\r\nunfortunately, while scarcely more than a child. The estrangement with\r\nher mother had increased, and her brother had craftily widened the\r\nbreach. This last fact I had much trouble to elicit, and wormed it out of\r\nher piecemeal.\r\n\r\nAfter three years of neglect and ill-treatment, her husband had deserted\r\nher and run away with another woman—incidentally, her best friend—leaving\r\nher almost destitute. When she recovered from an attack of brain fever\r\nshe found a letter from her brother awaiting her, in which he announced\r\nthe death of their mother, his marriage to the trained nurse who had\r\ntaken care of the mother in her last illness, and their exodus to Europe.\r\nHe inclosed a copy of the will, which left everything unreservedly\r\nto him, and said that his attorney would communicate with her. The\r\nman-of-the-law came in person, and stated that he was empowered to pay\r\nher a hundred dollars a month, so long as she did not attempt litigation.\r\n\r\nThe will was witnessed by the doctor and the trained nurse, and the\r\ndoctor was, to all intents, beyond discovery.\r\n\r\nIt was, on its face, a probable case of undue influence and, perhaps,\r\nmental aberration. But how prove either, without the doubly expert\r\ntestimony of the missing physician, who, it appeared, was the only\r\nperson, except the son and the nurse, that had seen the invalid during\r\nthe last year of her life?\r\n\r\nIt was a significant fact that the daughter’s name was not mentioned in\r\nthe instrument; and I suspected collusion on the part of the medical\r\ngentleman with the beneficiary and the woman who would share the profits\r\nof the criminal enterprise. My poor little client had seen the doctor\r\nonce only when she was vainly endeavoring to gain access to her mother,\r\nand described him as a very fine-looking man on the sunny slope of forty,\r\nwith wavy blond hair and pointed beard, a suave and kindly manner, a\r\ncharming voice and singularly handsome hands.\r\n\r\nThe bill of items would have fitted tolerably a dozen men of my\r\nacquaintance, and I said as much, asking her, as an afterthought, how she\r\ncame to notice his hands. Someone has said that the gist of a woman’s\r\nletter is in the postscript, and the large majority of women that have\r\nemployed me as counsel have invariably reserved the leading and important\r\nfacts of their cases until the last. This client was no exception to the\r\nrule; but when the dramatic little body had finished personating the\r\nmissing man, I would have known him as far as I could see him among ten\r\nthousand, unless he were asleep or quite still; for she had cleverly\r\nimitated a man whose restless hands were ever in motion as he talked,\r\nand who glanced at them with covert satisfaction every few seconds. This\r\nsingular trick, the descriptive factors in his personal equation, and\r\nthe name he had signed—which, she assured me, was undoubtedly his own—as\r\nwitness to the signature of the testatrix were about all the additional\r\ninformation I could extract from her, except that she had refused her\r\nbrother’s proposition and was ready to fight to the bitter end for her\r\nchildren’s rights, though she had to beg or steal the money to pay court\r\nand counsel.\r\n\r\nI waived retainer and took the case on contingent fee, which, after\r\nthe little grass widow had left, I told my wife, in gentle irony, I\r\nwould divide with her; but that she must not squander it on yachts and\r\nfour-in-hands, because these big paying cases are pretty rare—fortunately.\r\n\r\nThat good woman received my ironic suggestion with her usual placidity,\r\nand said: “Very well, my dear; I shall certainly hold you to your promise\r\nof division, and I have a premonition that we shall win the suit. Mark\r\nmy words! I don’t want a yacht, but I shall buy that lovely Goldsborough\r\nplace and spend my declining years looking at the river-view from that\r\nglorious, wide piazza.”\r\n\r\nI had not the slightest hope of success, for even if the witness could be\r\nfound, I had no doubt that he was a scamp and in the brother’s pay.\r\n\r\nA letter to a friend and fellow-attorney in the city where the mother\r\nhad died brought this reply: The man I wanted to find had been a general\r\npractitioner there for some years; he had had a very large practice\r\nand the liking and respect of the community; but both had fallen away\r\nfrom him from two very odd causes; one, that he had suddenly become\r\nexceedingly untrustworthy and unreliable, in fact, a phenomenal and\r\noutrageous liar; and the other, that he had unaccountably taken to the\r\nhabitual wearing on every possible or impossible occasion, professional\r\nor social, of white kid gloves or long white gauntlets, bringing these\r\nghostly hands to the bedside of patients, or hovering with them over the\r\noperating-table. It began to be noised abroad that Dr. Bently, which was\r\nhis name, was unsound in his mind, was suffering from some dreadful,\r\ncontagious disease which had broken out in his hands, and that the truth\r\nwas not in him. My informant added that shortly after the death of Mrs.\r\nJohnstone, my small client’s mother, the doctor had taken himself, his\r\ngauntlets and his marvelous mendacity to New York, but that his present\r\nwhereabouts were unknown to the writer.\r\n\r\nThe detective agency in New York, of which I next inquired, sent me word\r\nthat there was no such name as Bernard Brice Bently in the directory or\r\nin any way on record as a physician or surgeon in that city. All this\r\ntook time, and, meanwhile, I had advertised vainly in prominent papers\r\nall over the country and had had an agent interview many of the doctor’s\r\nold acquaintances. The man had disappeared, and within a very narrow\r\nlimit of time the will would be admitted to probate.\r\n\r\nJust at this time another legal matter required my presence in New York,\r\nand, when I reached there, the engrossing nature of my business drove\r\nmost other matters out of my head. After several days of close and\r\nconfining work, I finished taking the depositions I needed, and purposed\r\nto return home that evening. It occurred to me that a pleasant way of\r\nspending my remaining hours in town would be to take a stroll through\r\nCentral Park, which I had not seen in years—not, in fact, since I had\r\nbeen a student in Columbia Law School.\r\n\r\nI walked from the Fifty-ninth Street entrance as far as the Museum, which\r\nis about opposite Eighty-second Street, and had sat down to rest near the\r\nobelisk. It was a magnificent late spring day, and I was lazily enjoying\r\nthe beauty of the place and watching the passing show, when a man on the\r\nnext bench attracted my attention by springing to his feet and gazing\r\neagerly and fiercely beyond me and up the drive. If ever ferocious desire\r\nand intent to kill were written on a human face it was on his.\r\n\r\nInstinctively I glanced in the direction he was looking and saw a\r\nsteam runabout, with one man in it, approaching smoothly and not very\r\nrapidly. I turned back instantly and sprang at the would-be assassin,\r\nwhose pistol was out and pointed, but I was too late. There was a flash\r\nand a report, and I could see the hammer of the self-cocker rising for\r\na second shot, when I struck him a left-hander. I do not often have\r\noccasion to hit a man, but when I do he usually falls. As he went down\r\nthe weapon spoke again, but I knew that that bullet went wide. The fellow\r\nwas game, though, and determined, for his back had scarcely touched the\r\nground before he rolled on his side and fired twice at the man in the\r\nlocomobile. The fifth chamber of the revolver he let me have, as I flung\r\nmyself down on him, and the subsequent proceedings were blank, the ball\r\nhaving grazed my temple and stunned me.\r\n\r\nWhen I came to I was lying on a leather couch in a very handsomely\r\nappointed doctor’s office. My head was bound up, and I was a bit sick\r\nand dizzy. I suppose I had half swooned again, when I was roused by a\r\nsoft touch on my wrist, and looking down I saw the most beautiful and\r\nthe whitest man’s hand I have ever seen. But, white as it was, the fine,\r\nfilbert-shaped nails were whiter still. They were absolutely milky, and\r\nthe half-moons had the ghostly whiteness and lustre of pearls. I was both\r\nstartled and fascinated. Surely no living flesh was ever that color, and\r\nno human being with blood in him ever had such nails. Was it the hand of\r\na corpse? No, it was warm, and, as I looked, the fingers bent and sought\r\nmy pulse. A deep, musical voice broke the silence:\r\n\r\n“Ah, we are all right now, thank God! How do you feel, friend? Drink\r\nthis.” The speaker, holding a tumbler, came in front of me, and I saw a\r\nhandsome man with clean-shaven face, black, wavy hair and beautiful but\r\nrather wild-looking eyes.\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” I said as I took the glass and obediently drained it; “I\r\nfeel somewhat as though I had been trifling with a steam-hammer. But I\r\nshall be all right presently.”\r\n\r\n“Of course you will,” he assured me heartily. “You were struck a glancing\r\nblow on the head by the bullet of that poor, half-crazed Pole, who, the\r\npolice say, thought I was a Russian duke. The only ill consequence of\r\nyour noble act will be an honorable scar, to remind you how gallantly you\r\nrisked your life to save a total stranger’s. My dear friend—if you will\r\nallow a friendless man to call you so”—here the charming voice grew as\r\nsweet and vibrant as an organ note—“it was the bravest and most generous\r\nact I ever knew. I cannot thank you adequately, but I hope it may be\r\ngiven me to serve you some time, and should you ever need a friend’s\r\npurse, his hand or his life, mine are yours.”\r\n\r\nI endeavored to deprecate the value of my interference and to moderate\r\nhis expressions of gratitude; but he would have none of it, and,\r\nleaping to his feet, began to pace to and fro, expatiating upon what he\r\nextravagantly termed my bravery and unselfishness, and insisting upon his\r\ntremendous obligation to me. He was manifestly in earnest; but all at\r\nonce habit asserted itself, the ruling passion came to the fore, and a\r\ntrifle “light as air” made “confirmation strong as proof of Holy Writ.”\r\nWhen he first began to move a memory flashed over me, but, as those\r\nbeautiful, restless white hands added their evidence, assurance became\r\ndoubly sure. I could see my demure, pretty little client impersonating\r\nthis man, and I knew, despite the dyed hair and the shaven beard, that\r\nI had found the missing witness. But I had found something else. I had\r\nfound a man suffering from a chronic dementia. Whether his derangement\r\nwas general or merely monomania, I was at a loss to determine. If the\r\nformer, he was not competent as a witness for either side. If the latter,\r\nthe special form and degree of alienation might or might not militate\r\nagainst his testimony.\r\n\r\nI was impelled to take him unawares, and so I said suddenly: “Dr. Bently,\r\ndo you remember Mrs. Abbott, the daughter of your former patient, Mrs.\r\nJohnstone, of Laneville?”\r\n\r\nIf he started or showed surprise or annoyance, it was imperceptible; but\r\nhe glanced with smiling complaisance at his nails as he came over to\r\nme, and, touching my forehead, remarked, with most irritating suavity:\r\n“My dear fellow, I fear you are feverish. My name is Charles Chester\r\nChickering. I never was in Laneville, I never had a patient named\r\nJohnstone, and I have no recollection whatever of anyone by the name of\r\nAbbott.”\r\n\r\nHe looked straight at me as he uttered these falsehoods, and his tone was\r\nlike velvet. There was the flicker of an amused smile on his mouth, but\r\nhis eyes were hard and cold as blued steel, the contracted pupils shining\r\nlike black pinheads. I stared back at him, and presently he shifted his\r\ngaze from my face to his own right hand, which he was holding out in\r\nfront of him, and again that abominable, self-satisfied smirk appeared.\r\nI was filled with boundless contempt for this man I had almost begun to\r\npity, and as I rose from the couch and began to speak I could fairly\r\ntaste the bitterness of the words I flung at him:\r\n\r\n“Dr. or Mr. Bernard Brice Bently, Charles Chester Chickering—or whatever\r\nyour infernal, alliterative _alias_ may be—I deeply regret that I should\r\nhave saved you from the death I have no doubt you richly deserved, and I\r\nearnestly hope that you may be punished for your crime of helping to ruin\r\na poor little woman and two innocent children. And, by the living God! I\r\nwill do all in my power to bring you to——”\r\n\r\nHe interrupted me eagerly, wonderingly, protestingly. “What is that you\r\nsay? Mrs. Abbott and her children living? Why, that scoundrel Johnstone\r\nand that she-devil of a nurse swore to Mrs. Johnstone and me that all\r\nthree of them were dead and buried!”\r\n\r\nHope came to life again in my heart. It was a mistake, after all, and\r\nthis man could and would rectify it. He had been deceived and had\r\nwitnessed the document in good faith. I had commenced an apology when he\r\nuttered a violent exclamation, and, holding the backs of his hands in\r\nfront of his face, scrutinized his nails with rapt intensity.\r\n\r\nHis very lips grew livid, the eyes he turned on me were those of a\r\nmadman, and, snarling like a wolf, he screamed: “See what you have\r\ndone! Look at my nails!” and thrust his pallid fingers forward for my\r\ninspection.\r\n\r\nOn the polished, snowy surface of every nail was a bright pink fleck\r\nor spot of about the bigness and shape of a ladybug; but I was barely\r\nconscious of these rosy marks on the intense whiteness of the uncanny\r\nthings, for I suppose the smart rap of that pistol bullet and this man’s\r\nextraordinary sayings and doings had upset my fairly choleric temper, and\r\nI was literally beside myself with uncontrollable rage and indignation.\r\n\r\n“Damn you and your dead nails!” I shouted back at him. “You cowardly liar\r\nand thief, you are Johnstone’s accomplice, and I will tear the truth out\r\nof you if I have to kill you to do it.”\r\n\r\nWe were glaring at each other like wild beasts, and, before the words\r\nwere fairly out of my mouth, we sprang forward, our hands clutching\r\nhungrily at each other’s throats in the fierce desire to strangle which\r\ncomes to men and the other brutes that slay when anger and hate have\r\nreached the last and deadly stage. An undercut would have driven him\r\nback, but I wanted his windpipe and he wanted mine, and each of us was\r\nsick to have the other at close quarters, so a blow would not have been\r\nfair play. We were well matched. I was sure of that as we grappled. We\r\nswayed and strained, and I could feel the blood running down my face\r\nwhen my wound reopened; but the end came quickly, and, as we crashed to\r\nthe floor, he was underneath, and my hands flew up eagerly and clenched\r\nunder his chin. Ah! the savage joy of it!\r\n\r\nBut why did he not struggle? What trick was this? Good God, had the fall\r\nkilled him? How white he was! And he had been crimson a second ago.\r\nThe revulsion of feeling turned me sick. Was I a murderer? I let go my\r\nhold, leaped to my feet and threw a pitcher of ice water on his head and\r\nface. He gasped, opened his eyes and regarded me calmly and quietly. Was\r\nit only a moment ago that those calm, sad eyes had been narrow rims of\r\nblue around intensely black, distended pupils that had in them the dull\r\nred glare of blood-lust? Now they were soft and human, and the light of\r\nsanity was in them.\r\n\r\n“My friend,” he said gently—what a superb voice he had, and how the deep,\r\nrich, mellow tones brushed away anger, hatred and fear—“my friend, I owe\r\nyou my life twice. First, you saved it; now, you spare it. And I owe you\r\nmore than life. I owe you my restoration to reason, to perfect sanity.\r\nFor I have been bitten by a mania so wild, so strange, so improbable\r\nthat no man save you who have seen it would believe in its existence.\r\n‘Like cures like.’ It came through a fall and a shock. It has been cured\r\nthrough a fall and a shock. You were right. I _was_ a liar. The greatest\r\non earth, I believe, and I gloried in it, and hated to tell a truth lest\r\nit should bring a pink spot on my nails. No, don’t lift me up.”\r\n\r\nI had attempted to raise him and had blurted out a word or two of shame,\r\nsympathy and pity.\r\n\r\n“I prefer to lie here while I tell you the story,” he went on. “You\r\nhave no cause to be ashamed; it was simple self-defense on your part,\r\nfor I should probably have killed you in my paroxysm. Besides, you do\r\nnot realize what you have done for me. But I thank you for your kindly\r\nsympathy; it is not wasted, believe me. Now, if you will do me a favor,\r\nwatch my nails, and, if they become normal, tell me. But, first, put one\r\nof those wet compresses on your wound and slip the bandage over it. You\r\nwill forgive me by and bye for fighting with a guest to whom I owed so\r\nmuch. I was not responsible.”\r\n\r\nI hastened to reassure him, and he resumed:\r\n\r\n“Before I begin my own weird tale, let me relieve your mind about that\r\npoor, wronged, sensitive child, Mrs. Abbott. I will go back with you\r\nto Laneville, and we will break that will wide open. There will be no\r\ntrouble about it. Johnstone is a whelp, his wife is a criminal, and I\r\ncan put them both behind the bars. That little woman shall be righted,\r\nif it takes my entire fortune to do it. Now, listen. A trifle over a\r\nyear ago, getting out of my phaeton, I fell, struck my head and was out\r\nof my mind for some weeks. When I regained health and strength I found\r\nthat my injury had left me with the most unthinkable hallucination that\r\never crept into a human brain. Subconsciously, I knew it was a vicious\r\ndelusion, but I took the same delight in it that a patient partly in the\r\ncontrol of delirium sometimes takes in the absurdities he utters.\r\n\r\n“You know the little white marks on the nails which, as children, we used\r\nto say came from telling lies? Well, my mania was that if I told nothing\r\n_but_ lies, lied constantly and consistently, I could turn mine entirely\r\nwhite. I tried and I succeeded. The will, obeying a diseased mind, plays\r\nqueer pranks. I was partly proud of the result of my experiment, partly\r\nashamed of it. So I took to wearing gloves and gauntlets most of the\r\ntime. I began to get a reputation as a phenomenal liar. Once I overheard\r\na man say, ‘Dr. Bently says it is so? Then that settles it; it’s a lie\r\nthat would turn Beelzebub green with envy. Why, I wouldn’t believe the\r\ndoctor if he swore to anything on seventeen cubic miles of Bibles in the\r\noriginal Hebrew.’\r\n\r\n“I could have hugged him with grateful delight. But friends and\r\npractice dropped away. People began to look at me askance, and before\r\nMrs. Johnstone died she was about the only patient of our class I had\r\nleft. The street urchins used to yell at me, ‘Hallo, Ananias! where’s\r\nSapphira?’ and ‘Berny Bently; or, The Hidden Hand.’ So I came here and\r\nhid myself in this great city, where no one cares for anything but money\r\nand would make much of a rich man if he had claws, hoofs, horns and a\r\ntail all white as snow or black as ink.”\r\n\r\nWhile he spoke I had watched his nails closely and curiously, and the\r\npink spots had spread and spread, slowly but surely, until the normal,\r\nhealthy color had come back to them. I told him, but he never looked at\r\nthem. Instead, he got up, came over to me, took my two hands in his and\r\nsaid slowly and reverently: “Thank God and you, dear friend, I am cured!”\r\nHis splendid eyes were filled with tears, and his exquisite voice was\r\nsolemn and broken with emotion. My own eyes were rather misty, but then\r\nthey were never much good; and, for a lawyer, I was quite moved. I gave\r\nhim my friendship then and there, and I have never regretted it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTwo weeks later, starting from my own home, where Mrs. Abbott and Bently\r\nhad been our most welcome guests, we all went to Laneville, where we met\r\nMr. and Mrs. Johnstone, whom we had summoned back by cable. They made us\r\nbut little trouble, being cowards as well as scoundrels. Mrs. Abbott,\r\nhowever—good, kindly, generous little soul—was so unfeignedly sorry for\r\nher unworthy brother that she wished to let him have the lion’s share of\r\nthe big property; but we overruled the soft-hearted child-woman and made\r\nher take her full share. I had the pleasure, subsequently, of expressing\r\nto Mr. Johnstone exactly what I thought of him, and I had considerable\r\ndifficulty in restraining the doctor from giving him a beating.\r\n\r\nNot long after I began divorce proceedings for Mrs. Abbott, but her\r\nrascally husband saved her and me the annoyance of going into court by\r\nopportunely and thoughtfully dying.\r\n\r\nMy fee was the largest I have ever received from an individual client,\r\nand, in some extenuation for accepting such a small fortune, I would like\r\nto say that it was fairly forced on me by the grateful little creature I\r\nlove as though she were my own child.\r\n\r\nMy wife promptly demanded, and got, her little commission of one-half,\r\nand said she was the best drummer of practice and big-paying clients that\r\nany lawyer ever had. She is, God bless her! And, by the way, we live in\r\nthe Goldsborough house, and my dear lady spends a good part of her time\r\non the piazza she bought with her half of my fee.\r\n\r\nOh, yes! I forgot to mention that Mrs. Abbott’s name is now Bently. They\r\ncall her husband “the good physician” in our town, and his word is as\r\ngood as any man’s bond. The doctor has lost interest in his hands, but\r\nhis sweet and devoted little wife admires them extravagantly. They are\r\nstill very handsome, but brown as berries, and his nails are as pink as\r\nyours or mine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _Organization and Education_\r\n\r\n                            BY WHARTON BARKER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cardinal tenets of the People’s Party were declared by the\r\nfounders of the Republic, established by the War of the Revolution and\r\nguaranteed to our people by the Constitution of the United States. So,\r\nby proclaiming for rule of justice, liberty and equality of opportunity,\r\nnot of greed, man was made the master and money the servant. Those who\r\nbelieve in government of, by and for the people, who believe that the\r\npeople are fitted to govern themselves, capable of discerning that which\r\nis good for them and that which is not, must approve the contention the\r\nPeople’s Party makes; must oppose the aggression of concentrated capital;\r\nmust see the need of immediate independent political action outside and\r\napart from both Republican and Democratic Parties, both dominated by the\r\nmoney cliques.\r\n\r\nThe money oligarchy, now in control of all lines of finance,\r\ntransportation, distribution and of most lines of production, works\r\nfor the profit of the few to the great detriment of the many. These\r\nplutocrats control a slavish metropolitan press, in order that the masses\r\nof our people may be governed for the benefit of the few.\r\n\r\nIf this control is to stand, if millions of people are to slave for a\r\nfew thousand, it is necessary that the many have no direct hand in their\r\nown government, that the many delegate to representatives their power,\r\nand that such representatives should be influenced so as to become the\r\nrepresentatives of the few. The people must have only the semblance of\r\npower, the representatives the real power, in order that governing may be\r\ncarried on for the advantage of the rulers, not of the ruled.\r\n\r\nSo we have nominating conventions run by political bosses, legislative\r\nbodies taking orders from agents of the money cliques, who purchase\r\nfranchises for railway lines and for other public utilities; election\r\nlaws that make independent voting almost impossible.\r\n\r\nUntil we have direct nominations the people will be the willing or\r\nunwilling tools of the men who dictate nominations, and they must make\r\nchoice between the candidates set up for them. For years the Republican\r\nand Democratic politicians who run conventions have been the agents of\r\nthe money oligarchy that deals in and fattens upon all kinds of public\r\nfranchises. So the plutocrats make of our Government an instrument for\r\nthe oppression of the many and the enrichment of the few. In order to\r\npromote the governing of our people by the few and for the few, promote\r\nlegislation that will impoverish and weaken the many but aggrandize\r\nthe few in riches and power, it is necessary that law-making should be\r\nintrusted to representatives; that these representatives should be put\r\nmore and more out of touch with the people and more in touch with the\r\nfew; that these representatives should be removed further and further\r\nfrom responsibility to the people; that their doings should be hidden and\r\nnot subject to review.\r\n\r\nSo we have demands for extended terms of office; we have opposition\r\nto the election of President and senators by popular vote; we have\r\nopposition to the selection of Federal judges other than by appointment\r\nof the President and Senate; we have, above all, opposition to direct\r\npopular voting upon questions of public policy, upon granting public\r\nfranchises.\r\n\r\nThe referendum is opposed because it would make all laws passed by\r\nlegislative bodies subject to review and reversal by a high court, the\r\ncourt of the whole people entering verdict through the ballot-box. There\r\nis little outward opposition to the principle of direct legislation.\r\nThere is much covert opposition from the money oligarchy and much plainer\r\nopposition born of ignorance from the body of the people.\r\n\r\nThose who oppose direct legislation hold that the people are not fitted\r\nto govern themselves, that the few are fitted by divine law to rule, that\r\nthe many are condemned to be ruled for the benefit of the few by a law\r\nequally divine. This is the law of kings; it is not the law of democracy.\r\nHe who holds it is false to our theory of government, is no better than a\r\nmonarchist.\r\n\r\nGive us direct legislation, such as the initiative and referendum\r\nwould establish, and there will be an end to sale of franchises by\r\nrepresentatives and no laws will be enacted to rob the people of their\r\nrights and property. The place to begin with direct voting is in\r\nnomination of all candidates for public office—a People’s Party must\r\nabolish all delegate conventions for making nominations and platforms;\r\nmust adopt direct voting for candidates and for declarations of\r\nprinciples; must have voting precinct clubs for party management. The\r\ndistrict and subdivision plan of organization adopted by the Cincinnati\r\nconvention of 1900 is the best plan of organization heretofore proposed,\r\nand it should be put into immediate operation unless a better plan can be\r\nproposed without delay, for it will insure rule of the people in party\r\nmanagement and destroy the power of the political boss who goes into\r\npolitics for profit.\r\n\r\nIf the People’s Party will at once declare for a rank-and-file plan of\r\norganization and management we will see a rush to arms in all states,\r\nfor in all the rule of the boss, serving the money oligarchy, is most\r\noffensive. The time has come for such a People’s Party; there is no place\r\nfor a People’s Party run on the lines of the Republican and Democratic\r\nParties.\r\n\r\nThe day of the hero-led party has passed. The great majority Mr.\r\nRoosevelt received is no evidence to the contrary, for more than three\r\nmillion citizens out of seventeen million abstained from voting at the\r\nlast election. Organization and education of the body of the people\r\nmust come through voting precinct organizers and educators—of course\r\nthe printed matter must for economy be prepared and sent out from\r\ncentral offices, from national headquarters, but no proper, no effective\r\ndistribution of it can be made except by the precinct organizers.\r\n\r\nIf the people are to win a national victory there must be from three to\r\nfive honest, able, aggressive, patriotic men in each of the one hundred\r\nthousand voting districts of the country working by day and by night.\r\nThese men must awaken their immediate neighbors to a lively appreciation\r\nof the wrongs they suffer and point out the way to re-establishment of\r\ntheir rights, the way to restoration of justice, liberty and equality of\r\nopportunity. When such an army is in the field the people will defeat the\r\nmoney oligarchy, but not before.\r\n\r\nAt the election of 1904, I repeat, three million citizens refused to\r\nvote because they would not stultify themselves by voting for either\r\nRoosevelt or Parker, both candidates of the plutocrats. At least two\r\nmillion citizens voted for Roosevelt because they wished to destroy\r\nthe Democratic Party, a party for years without fixed principles.\r\nThese five million citizens, together with the eight hundred thousand\r\ncitizens who voted for Debs, Watson and Swallow, represented the reform\r\nand dissatisfied vote of the country—five months since. The action of\r\nthe Beef Trust, of the Railroad Combination and of allied interests,\r\nall in control of twenty men, and the now openly declared purpose of\r\nPresident Roosevelt and Secretary Hay to establish in foreign affairs an\r\nAmerican-British alliance, alarm many millions of our citizens as they\r\nhave not been alarmed before.\r\n\r\nA new epoch in our country opens now, for people and plutocrats are in\r\na death struggle. The principle the People’s Party stands for is that\r\nman is the master, money the servant. The question—is the People’s Party\r\nequal to the duty of the time?—must be answered at once. If it goes into\r\nthe campaign immediately with a voting precinct organization such as was\r\ndeclared for by the Cincinnati convention of 1900, the answer will be\r\naffirmative.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal tenets of the party of the people are:\r\n\r\n1. Brotherhood of man, love, justice, liberty and equality of opportunity.\r\n\r\n2. Government by the people—the recognition of the right of the people to\r\nrule themselves by establishment of direct legislation, the initiative\r\nand the referendum.\r\n\r\n3. Honest money—national money, not bank money—that will serve creditor\r\nand debtor alike; that will insure stability of prices, thus be an honest\r\nmeasure of value, and thereby encourage honest industry and discourage\r\nspeculation.\r\n\r\n4. Nationalization of railroads and other monopolies that must be public\r\nrather than private monopolies.\r\n\r\n5. Prevention of overcapitalization of all corporations, of overcharge\r\nfor services rendered the public by such corporations.\r\n\r\n6. Abolition of industrial trusts, those that exist because of tariff\r\nprotection and those that exist because of freight discriminations\r\nwhether by rebates, special rates or otherwise.\r\n\r\n7. Taxation that will tax every man according to his accumulated\r\nwealth—tax property, not man; collect state and municipal taxes by direct\r\ntax on the accumulated wealth of society assessed at actual cash value;\r\ncollect national taxes by a direct tax on the earnings of accumulated\r\nwealth, whether large or small. Have only direct taxes, for indirect\r\ntaxes cover injustice and extravagance.\r\n\r\n8. Foreign policy that will keep our country out of all entangling\r\nalliances with European and Asiatic countries, and strengthen our\r\neconomic relations with all American countries that have different soil,\r\nclimate and products from those of the United States.\r\n\r\nThese are the demands of the People’s Party, the cardinal principles\r\nfor which that party contends. They are all simple, easily understood,\r\nand must have approval of a great majority of the American people when\r\nbrought to them for consideration by a party of the rank and file,\r\ncontrolled by the people themselves, not dictated to by the money\r\noligarchy; by a party that stands for the interests of the many, not\r\nof the few. I close, as I began, by saying we need organization and\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _The Panic of 1893_\r\n\r\n                             BY W. S. MORGAN\r\n\r\n\r\n    Hon. THOMAS E. WATSON,\r\n                 _Thomson, Ga._\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR—I have your letter containing communications from James R.\r\nBranch, Secretary of the American Bankers’ Association, New York City,\r\nand Jno. D. Reynolds, President of First National Bank, of Rome, Ga., in\r\nwhich they deny the authenticity of the Panic Bulletin published in my\r\ncontribution to the March issue of your magazine.\r\n\r\nI remember when the Bulletin was first made public I asked a friend, a\r\npresident of the Citizens’ National Bank, of Fort Scott, Kan., a man with\r\nwhom I was intimately connected in business for ten or twelve years, if\r\nsuch a circular had been issued. He replied that he had received a number\r\nof circulars covering the propositions therein contained, and that likely\r\nhe had received that one. This incident, and the fact that the Bulletin\r\nhad been published from time to time for years and I had not seen its\r\nauthenticity questioned, and furthermore that its suggestions were in\r\nline with the events of that date, led me to believe that it was genuine.\r\n\r\nHowever, the authenticity of the circular was not the subject matter of\r\nthe article which provoked these denials. My indictment of the National\r\nBankers was not merely for issuing the Bulletin, but for doing the things\r\nit suggested. Messrs. Branch and Reynolds have ignored the indictment\r\nand attacked the witness. But there are other witnesses that can’t be\r\ndemolished.\r\n\r\nAfter Mr. Cleveland had sent Henry Villard and Don M. Dickinson to\r\nWashington, in the winter of 1893, and failed to secure from the\r\nFifty-second Congress the repeal of the purchasing clause of the Sherman\r\nlaw, the National Bankers began to show their hand.\r\n\r\nIt was seen that no ordinary pressure on Congress would secure the\r\ndemonetization of silver. It was claimed that the Panic Bulletin was\r\nissued March 8, just four days after Cleveland’s second inauguration.\r\n\r\nWhat was the program laid down in the Panic Bulletin?\r\n\r\n        1. The interests of the National Banks require immediate\r\n      financial legislation.\r\n\r\n        2. Silver, silver certificates and Treasury notes must be\r\n      retired and National Bank-notes, upon a gold basis, be made\r\n      the only kind of paper money.\r\n\r\n        3. Bonds required to be issued as a basis for the bank-note\r\n      circulation.\r\n\r\n        4. Pressure must be brought upon the people, especially in\r\n      sections of the country where the free silver sentiment was\r\n      strong. Circulation to be reduced, loans called in, credit\r\n      refused and general distrust spread broadcast through the\r\n      land.\r\n\r\n        5. Demand for an extra session of Congress to repeal the\r\n      purchasing clause of the Sherman law.\r\n\r\nThis was the program laid down by the Bulletin. Did it agree with the\r\naction of the National Bankers? We shall see.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of April, 1893, Grover Cleveland appointed Conrad C. Jordan\r\nto be Assistant Treasurer of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn this capacity Jordan had control of the Sub-Treasury at New York.\r\nThe Sub-Treasury is the great business establishment of the Federal\r\nGovernment. It is one of the associated banks of New York City.\r\n\r\nJordan was a banker, the President of the Western National, of New York\r\nCity, and was recommended for the position by the New York National Bank\r\nPresidents. He was the go-between—the link which connected the National\r\nBankers with Cleveland and the Federal Government.\r\n\r\nHis nomination was confirmed on the 15th day of April, and on the 20th he\r\nwas in Washington with his bond and conferring with Cleveland.\r\n\r\nFrom that hour things moved with wonderful rapidity.\r\n\r\nJordan left Washington on the 21st, arrived in New York at 5.30 in the\r\nafternoon, went directly to the Chase National Bank, No. 15 Nassau\r\nStreet, where he met Henry W. Cannon, President of the Chase National\r\nBank, and J. Edward Simmons, President of the Fourth National, two of the\r\nmost active and influential of those who controlled the associated banks\r\nand who constitute the “New York National Bank Ring.”\r\n\r\nIt must have been an important meeting, for that night Cannon left New\r\nYork for Washington on a midnight train, arriving in Washington Saturday\r\nmorning, April 22, and while there had interviews with Grover Cleveland.\r\nOn the morning of April 22 Jordan was sworn into office, and his first\r\nact, official or semi-official, was to arrange for a meeting with certain\r\nNational Bank Presidents in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nI can give you the names of most of the National Bank Presidents who\r\nmet Jordan that afternoon. The meeting was said to be informal, and its\r\nproceedings were carefully guarded. But it was of such importance that\r\nJordan went to Washington on a late evening train to make a report of its\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\nIt was generally believed at the time, and there is little doubt of its\r\ntruth, that Jordan was simply given the office to mask his character as\r\nconfidential agent between Grover Cleveland and the New York National\r\nBank Presidents.\r\n\r\nAfter a conference with Cleveland on Sunday morning, April 23, Jordan and\r\nCannon returned to New York, arriving there late in the evening. Before\r\nleaving Washington Jordan wired certain National Bank Presidents to meet\r\nhim at a private house uptown.\r\n\r\nWhat happened at that meeting we can only surmise. I mention it to show\r\nthe connection between the National Bank Presidents and Grover Cleveland.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, April 24, Jordan was at his desk. One of the first\r\nthings he did was to notify the National Bank Presidents and officers\r\nof trusts and other companies to meet him that day at the Sub-Treasury.\r\nThis also was a dark-lantern meeting, and no one would give out the\r\nproceedings. But what followed shortly afterward, and the action taken\r\nby those who attended that meeting, justifies the belief that that\r\nconvention was called for the purpose of arranging a concerted attack\r\nupon the national industries, agriculture, commerce, property and social\r\norder of the American people—the assault to be directed by the New York\r\nNational Bank Presidents—as the swiftest and surest means of forcing\r\nCongress to repeal the silver law—to give the country Cleveland’s\r\n“Object-Lesson.”\r\n\r\nNine National Bank Presidents met John G. Carlisle at the Williams House\r\non April 27, presumably to complete the arrangements for the attack. No\r\ndoubt Cleveland had approved the conclusions reached on the 24th, and\r\nsent Carlisle to sanction them.\r\n\r\nCarlisle’s meeting with the Bank Presidents that day was, as you know,\r\na subject of much newspaper comment. The meeting was said to have been\r\none of “effusive cordiality,” and, in view of the events which quickly\r\nfollowed, there is little doubt but what it partook of the nature of “two\r\nhearts that beat as one.”\r\n\r\nIt was there that the National Bankers proposed an issue of bonds. But\r\nCarlisle, like a young girl, although keen to marry, intimated that it\r\nwas “too sudden.”\r\n\r\nThis was the last of the series of meetings between the Government\r\nofficials and the National Bank Presidents preceding the panic.\r\n\r\nEverything was now ready to give the country the “Object-Lesson.”\r\n\r\nWithin the next forty-eight hours the worst financial calamity that ever\r\nbefell the people was to break upon them.\r\n\r\nAt this time there was nothing in the industrial situation to precipitate\r\na panic. Prices had been low for several years, and there was none of the\r\nspirit of speculation which usually precedes a panic.\r\n\r\nCleveland himself volunteered to say: “Our unfortunate financial plight\r\nis not the result of untoward events, nor of conditions relating to our\r\nnatural resources, nor is it traceable to any of the afflictions which\r\nfrequently check national growth and prosperity. With plenteous crops,\r\nwith abundant promise of remunerative production and manufacture, with\r\nunusual invitation to safe investment and with satisfactory assurance to\r\nbusiness enterprise, suddenly financial distrust and fear have sprung up\r\non every side.”\r\n\r\nThus the people and all those engaged in industrial and productive\r\nenterprises are exonerated.\r\n\r\nWho are the guilty persons?\r\n\r\nThe men who did just what that Panic Bulletin describes.\r\n\r\nThe bankers who demanded the practical demonetization of silver; who\r\ndemanded a special session of Congress to secure it; who called in their\r\nloans and reduced their circulation; who demanded and secured the issue\r\nof bonds, and who now demand the retirement of the greenbacks.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Branch and Reynolds and other National Bank advocates may be able\r\nto repudiate the Panic Bulletin, but they cannot successfully deny that\r\nevery feature of the program it contained was carried out in detail by\r\nthe men who practically control the National Bank system.\r\n\r\nFour days after the Williams House meeting at which Secretary Carlisle\r\nwas present, the New York banks began to call in their loans with brutal\r\nvindictiveness.\r\n\r\nWe are not left to conjecture the effect of such a policy on the New York\r\nExchange. By the 5th of May the strain had become intense. The New York\r\n_Tribune_ of May 6, referring to the condition of the market, said: “The\r\nenormous losses of the last week, the utter demoralization of the buying\r\npower in the market and the practical paralysis of credit, promised a\r\nliquidation that, unless stayed, would have swept them all off their\r\nfeet.”\r\n\r\nOn May 7 the same paper said: “The effort of the Administration to bring\r\nthe South and West to a full realization of the inevitable consequences\r\nof compulsory purchases of silver bullion has brought distress and\r\nperhaps ruin to many innocent persons—but there is no reason to suppose\r\nthat it will be relaxed.”\r\n\r\nWithin ten days from the time of the Williams House meeting between\r\nCleveland’s Secretary of the Treasury and the National Bank Presidents\r\nthe panic had spread from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and for forty days\r\nit continued with unabated fury. On the 9th of May several Western banks\r\nwere forced to close their doors.\r\n\r\n“There is no lack of pressure,” said the New York _Tribune_ on the 22d of\r\nMay.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of June—six weeks after the Williams House meeting—the New\r\nYork _Sun_, in its money article, said: “The Presidents of the New York\r\nNational Banks think that the so-called “Object-Lesson” has been carried\r\nfar enough. They see nothing to be gained by a further shrinkage of\r\nvalues and unsettling of credits.”\r\n\r\nIt is useless for me to detail the results of the panic.\r\n\r\nFrom May 9 to 30, inclusive, sixty banks were forced to suspend, and\r\nfifty-eight of them were in the doomed section—the South, West and\r\nNorthwest.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of the Williams House meeting, April 27, to December 30,\r\n1893, a period of eight months, more than fifteen thousand bankruptcies\r\nand suspensions had occurred. Over six hundred banks had been driven to\r\nthe wall, and the loss to the country in round numbers was SEVEN HUNDRED\r\nAND FIFTY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.\r\n\r\nBut the National Bank Presidents had won their fight. They had carried\r\nout the program laid down in the Panic Bulletin, an extra session of\r\nCongress had been called and the purchasing clause repealed.\r\n\r\nThat the “Object-Lesson” was intended for the West and South is evidenced\r\nby the records. Out of 169 banks failing from March 5 to August 4, five\r\nonly were in Eastern States, forty-eight in Southern and 151 in Western\r\nstates—Dunn’s Report.\r\n\r\nDunn’s Report for July 21, 1893, says: “A large proportion of the\r\nsuspended Colorado banks and mercantile institutions will pay in full and\r\nresume business, inability to borrow money on or sell ample collateral\r\nalone being the cause of the Denver banks closing their doors.”\r\n\r\nNo doubt the panic reached proportions not at first intended by the\r\nNational Bank Presidents and threatened their own financial standing,\r\nas Mr. Branch suggests is the case in time of panics. But they had a\r\nremedy, no doubt decided upon beforehand. While they refused credit to\r\nthe Southern and Western banks, they issued Clearing House certificates\r\nto the extent of $63,152,000 to themselves, an act which was in violation\r\nof the law.\r\n\r\nThere is so much evidence obtainable to the effect that the National\r\nBankers are guilty of every count in the indictment contained in the\r\nPanic Bulletin that a book could be filled with it.\r\n\r\nIn a speech in the United States Senate August 25, 1893, Senator David\r\nB. Hill, referring to the bankers, said: “They inaugurated the policy of\r\nrefusing loans to the people even upon the best security, and attempted\r\nin every way to spread disaster broadcast throughout the land. These\r\ndisturbers—the promoters of public peril—represented largely the creditor\r\nclass, the men who desire to appreciate the gold dollar in order to\r\nsubserve their own selfish interests, men who revel in hard times, men\r\nwho drive harsh bargains with their fellow-men regardless of financial\r\ndistress. It is not strange that the present panic has been induced,\r\nintensified and protracted by reason of these malign influences. Having\r\ncontributed much to bring about the present exigency, these men are now\r\nunable to control it. They have sown the wind, and we are now all reaping\r\nthe whirlwind together” (_Congressional Record_, Vol. XXV, Part I, p.\r\n865).\r\n\r\nAugust 8, 1893, Senator Teller said, in a speech in the United States\r\nSenate:\r\n\r\n“It is the height of folly that this is a panic caused by distrust of\r\nthe currency.” On the 29th of the same month the Senator from Colorado,\r\nreferring to the Williams House meeting of Secretary Carlisle with\r\nthe New York National Bank Presidents, said: “It is a most remarkable\r\ninterview; it will go far to support the charges which I am not going to\r\nmake on my own authority, but which I am going to make upon the authority\r\nof others, that this panic is a bankers’ panic, brought by the action\r\nof the New York banks, and brought about for distinct purposes, which\r\npurposes were practically avowed on the 27th of April. The same things\r\nhave been reiterated by the financial papers, and the policy is still\r\ncontinued up to the present hour. It had two objects in view. One was to\r\nsecure from the United States a large issue of bonds, and the other to\r\nsecure the repeal of the much-abused Sherman law.”\r\n\r\nThe records show that the bankers accomplished both of these objects.\r\nThey secured the repeal of the purchasing clause, and afterward the issue\r\nof $262,000,000 in bonds.\r\n\r\nIn the same speech Senator Teller said: “There are many banks in the\r\nWest, and some that I know of, which shut their doors because they could\r\nnot draw the money that they had on deposit in New York” (_Congressional\r\nRecord_, Vol. XXV, Part I, p. 1022).\r\n\r\nIn its issue of August 20, 1893, the Chicago _Inter-Ocean_ said:\r\n\r\n“When the future historian tells the world of the great financial panic\r\nof 1893, he will say: ‘In the winter and spring months of that year the\r\nNew York bankers and financiers sowed the wind, and in the summer months\r\nreaped the whirlwind.’\r\n\r\n“We know of no arrangement of words that can more graphically describe\r\nthe action of the New York financiers and the results of that action.\r\nColonel Ingersoll, early in the season of disturbance, properly called\r\nthis a ‘bankers’ panic.’ Nor are the New York bankers alone to blame.\r\nThose of Boston and Philadelphia come in for their share.”\r\n\r\nBut it is useless for me to continue to pile up testimony to further\r\nsustain my contention. Whether the Panic Bulletin is a “canard” or not,\r\nits suggestions were carried into effect. The bankers opposed silver,\r\nand, for the purpose of having the law providing for its issue repealed,\r\nthey precipitated the panic and used the methods described in the\r\nBulletin to accomplish their ends. They are opposed to greenbacks, and\r\nif necessary will, I have no doubt, precipitate another panic in order\r\nto have them retired. And it all goes to show that the control of the\r\ncurrency should be taken out of their hands.\r\n\r\n                                                          W. S. MORGAN.\r\n\r\n    _Hardy, Ark._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _The Cradle of Tears_\r\n\r\n                           BY THEODORE DREISER\r\n                       _Author of “Sister Carrie”_\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a cradle within the door of one of the great institutions of New\r\nYork before which a constantly recurring tragedy is being enacted. It is\r\na plain cradle, quite simply draped in white, but with such a look of\r\ncozy comfort about it that one would scarcely suspect it to be a cradle\r\nof sorrow.\r\n\r\nA little white bed with a neatly turned-back coverlet is made up within\r\nit. A long strip of white muslin, tied in a tasteful bow at the top,\r\ndrapes its rounded sides. About it, but within the precincts of warmth\r\nand comfort, of which it is a fort, spreads a chamber of silence—a quiet,\r\nsolemn, plainly furnished room, the appearance of which emphasizes the\r\npeculiarity of the cradle itself.\r\n\r\nIf the mind were not familiar with the details with which it is so\r\nstartlingly associated, the question would naturally arise as to what it\r\nwas doing there—why it should be standing there alone. No one seems to\r\nbe watching it. It has not the slightest appearance of usefulness, and\r\nyet there it stands, day after day, and year after year—a ready prepared\r\ncradle and no infant to live in it.\r\n\r\nAnd yet this cradle is the most useful and, in a way, the most inhabited\r\ncradle in the world. Day after day, and year after year, it is the\r\nrecipient of more small wayfaring souls than any other cradle in the\r\nworld. In it the real children of sorrow are placed, and over it more\r\ntears are shed than if it were an open grave.\r\n\r\nIt is the place where annually 1,200 foundlings are placed, many of them\r\nby mothers who are too helpless or too unfortunately environed to be\r\nfurther able to care for their child, and the misery which compels it\r\nmakes of the little open crib a cradle of tears.\r\n\r\nThe interest of this particular cradle is, that it has been the silent\r\nwitness of more truly heartbreaking scenes than any other cradle since\r\nthe world began. For nearly thirty-five years it has stood where it does\r\ntoday, ready-draped, open, while as many thousand mothers have stolen\r\nshamefacedly in and, after looking hopelessly about, have laid their\r\nhelpless offspring within its depths.\r\n\r\nFor thirty-five years, winter and summer, in the bitterest cold and the\r\nmost stifling heat, it has seen them come—the poor, the rich; the humble,\r\nthe proud; the beautiful, the homely—and one by one they have laid their\r\nchildren down and brooded over them, wondering whether it were possible\r\nfor human love to make so great a sacrifice and yet not die.\r\n\r\nAnd then when the child has been actually sacrificed, when by the simple\r\nact of releasing their hold upon it and turning away they have actually\r\nallowed it to pass out from their love and tenderness into the world\r\nunknown, this silent cradle has seen them smite their hands in anguish\r\nand yield to such voiceless tempests of grief as only those know who have\r\nloved much and lost all.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances under which this peculiar charity comes to be a part\r\nof the life of the great metropolis need not be rehearsed here. The\r\nheartlessness of men, the frailty of women, the brutality of all those\r\nwho sit in judgment in spite of the fact that they do not wish to be\r\njudged themselves, is so old and so commonplace that its repetition is\r\nalmost a weariness.\r\n\r\nStill the tragedy repeats itself, and year after year, and day after\r\nday the unlocked door is opened and dethroned virtue enters—the victim\r\nof ignorance and passion and affection, and a child is robbed of an\r\nhonorable home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _The Racing Trust_\r\n\r\n                          BY THOMAS B. FIELDERS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only Trust that has the sincere and earnest and unfaltering support\r\nof the daily press is the most audacious, the most grasping, the most\r\nimmoral of all trusts. This is the Racing Trust. There are hundreds of\r\ntrusts in this country. All corporations that have eliminated or lessened\r\ncompetition to a marked degree are called trusts. It is asserted,\r\ncommonly, that such combinations are against the laws of the states that\r\nform the Union and are in opposition to the Federal Constitution. If the\r\nBeef Trust or the Sugar Trust or the Standard Oil Trust have advocates\r\namong the daily newspapers of the country, these advocates are not\r\nearning their salt, to say nothing of their salaries. The only support\r\nthey have the courage to give is silence. Yet it has to be proven that\r\nthese trusts have infringed the law.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the Racing Trust there is no doubt. There is none to deny\r\nthat it is an absolute monopoly. It conducts business in open defiance\r\nof the law and the Constitution. It has the avarice of a miser, and the\r\nimpudent shamelessness of a courtezan. All who will help to fill its\r\nmaw are received with open arms. Lacking morals, it expects none of its\r\npatrons. Within its portals the scum of humanity is made as welcome as\r\nthe cream. It has its rules, but these are without and beyond the law,\r\nthough, curiously, they are enforced by so-called guardians of the law.\r\nThe Beef Trust, by its rapacious methods, may make vegetarians; the\r\nRacing Trust makes outcasts, who, sometimes, rise to the dignity of\r\nconvicts. The Beef Trust shuns advertisement; the Racing Trust welcomes\r\nit. Any reputable undertaking must pay heavily for the support of the\r\npress; the Racing Trust gets such support in columns per day for a\r\nridiculously small subvention. The press poses as a teacher of morality.\r\nIn the case of the Racing Trust it plays the part of a panderer without\r\ngetting the price insisted upon by that unutterable in any other walk of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nAmericans believe that they possess a quality of humor that is far\r\nsuperior to that which bears the hall-mark of any other nationality.\r\n’Tis a comfortable belief, for it enables them to live cheerfully under\r\nconditions which would not be tolerated elsewhere. There are several\r\nkinds of humorists among us, and of these the men who make inadequate\r\nlaws, or laws which they know will be broken, and the men who break them\r\nand go unpunished are worthy of more and of a different sort of attention\r\nthan they receive. People growl at the Beef Trust on account of the high\r\nprices of beef, though Mr. Garfield, who was instructed by the President\r\nto investigate that Trust, has said that its profits are only moderate.\r\n\r\nWhat of the profits of the Racing Trust? Monte Carlo is described\r\ninvariably as the most delectable gold mine in the world. In ordinary\r\ngold mines the vein may be “pinched out”; in Monte Carlo it runs on\r\nforever. Games made by gamblers for gamblers are called games of chance.\r\nThere is little humor in your gambler, else he would recognize the\r\nabsence of chance. Many thousands have tried to “break the bank” at Monte\r\nCarlo. Nobody has succeeded, for while play is conducted there honestly,\r\nthe games are of the “sure thing” variety, as the percentage is always\r\nin favor of the bank. But the shareholders of the Casino at Monte Carlo\r\nare satisfied with twenty per cent. per annum on their investment and,\r\nsometimes, get less. And let it be remembered that in conducting their\r\nbusiness they do not break the law.\r\n\r\nThe Racing Trust would scorn to accept anything so paltry as twenty per\r\ncent. on its investment, yet it is a law-breaker for seven months of the\r\nyear, on six days of the week, and in the course of time, doubtless, will\r\nbreak it on the seventh day of the week also.\r\n\r\nLaws against gambling have existed from time beyond count, just as they\r\nhave existed against murder and other crimes against public welfare. The\r\nConstitution of the state of New York prohibited all kinds of gambling\r\nuntil 1887. In that year the Legislature passed the “Ives Pool bill.”\r\nIves was a member of the Legislature from this city. Except that he\r\npiloted this particular bill through a legislature which was paid to\r\nadopt it, his name would have been forgotten. The bill called by his\r\nname suspended the provisions of the Penal Code relating to gambling at\r\nrace-tracks. It limited racing between May 15 and October 15. It limited\r\nracing upon any track to thirty days. It permitted bookmaking upon the\r\ntracks. In return for enormous privileges the racing associations were\r\nto pay to the state five per cent. of their gross receipts. The law\r\nconfined gambling to the tracks, and in order to take full advantage\r\nof it, and also, of course, to improve the breed of racing stock,\r\nphilanthropists of the convict stripe opened tracks where racing was\r\nconducted at night as well as by day, in winter as well as in summer. The\r\nmanner in which racing was conducted became a public scandal. The horse\r\nwas the principal factor, and, generally, was used as a means to an end.\r\nThere were, of course, owners and trainers and jockeys who were honest,\r\neven under the Ives Pool law, but these were very much in a minority.\r\nThe “sport” reeked with dishonesty. Horses were “pulled,” trainers and\r\njockeys were “stiffened.” Some of the racing officials not only winked\r\nat “crookedness,” but took part in it. Unless the starter of those days\r\nhad a piece of every “good thing,” it did not “come off” if he could\r\nprevent it. None talked of the improvement “of the breed” except with\r\ntongue in cheek. “Jobs” were discussed, after the event, as if they had\r\nbeen meritorious performances. When these were the work of trainers and\r\njockeys the bookmakers were derided; when they were planned and realized\r\nby bookmakers the latter were cursed. There was much cursing in those\r\ndays, as there was much reason for it, but the profanity was not due to\r\nthe failure of honest, but dishonest effort. Women as well as men were\r\nallowed to bet, and the race-tracks were hotbeds of debauchery. The great\r\nbody of those who were interested in racing was beyond the pale. The\r\nrefuse of the country camped in New York while the orgy lasted, and so\r\nobnoxious did these bandits make themselves that an organized effort was\r\nmade to induce the constitutional convention which met in 1895 to cleanse\r\nthe state of the filth which was bred by the Ives Pool law.\r\n\r\nThis convention appointed a committee, whose duty it was to prepare an\r\naddress to the people of the state. The address dealt with the work of\r\nthe convention. The committee called attention to the anti-gambling\r\namendment adopted by the convention in the following language: “The\r\npassion for gambling to which the system of lotteries formerly ministered\r\nhas found fresh opportunity under the so-called Ives Pool bill, and,\r\nunder color and pretext of betting upon horse races, is working\r\nwidespread demoralization and ruin among the young and weak throughout\r\nthe community. We have extended the prohibition against lotteries so as\r\nto include pool-selling, bookmaking and other forms of gambling. It is\r\nclaimed that this provision will array in opposition to the proposed\r\nConstitution a great and unscrupulous money power; but we appeal to the\r\nvirtue and sound judgment of the people to sustain the position which we\r\nhave taken.”\r\n\r\nThis address was signed by Messrs. Joseph H. Choate (Ambassador to\r\nEngland), Elihu Root, H. T. Cookinham, Elon R. Brown, Chester B.\r\nMcLaughlin, Milo M. Acker, Daniel H. McMillan and M. H. Hirschberg.\r\n\r\nThe anti-gambling amendment, which was adopted by the convention with\r\nonly four dissenting votes, was as follows:\r\n\r\n“The delegates of the People of the state of New York, in convention\r\nassembled, do propose as follows:\r\n\r\n“Section 10 of Article I of the Constitution is hereby amended so as to\r\nread: ‘No law shall be passed abridging the right of the people peaceably\r\nto assemble and to petition the Government or any department thereof;\r\nnor shall any divorce be granted otherwise than by judicial proceedings;\r\n_nor shall any lottery or the sale of lottery tickets, pool-selling,\r\nbookmaking or any kind of gambling hereafter be authorized or allowed\r\nwithin this state, and the Legislature shall pass appropriate laws to\r\nprevent offenses against any of the provisions of this section_.’”\r\n\r\nThe “great and unscrupulous money power” to which Mr. Choate and his\r\nassociates alluded was that of the racing associations. Their power was\r\nfelt in the convention, and some of those who discussed the amendment\r\nprior to its adoption claimed that it was offered at the suggestion of\r\none set of gamblers (poolroom keepers) against another set of gamblers\r\n(the racing associations). This was true enough. The racing associations\r\nwere as grasping then as they are now. Their members claimed that the\r\npoolroom was a nefarious and demoralizing influence. Why? Because it\r\nprevented the racing associations from having a monopoly of the petty as\r\nwell as the big gamblers’ money—of the cash of those who had not time to\r\ngo to the races as well as of those who were unable to go. The engines\r\nof the law were stoked up and run full tilt against the poolrooms at\r\nthe behest of the racing associations; therefore, in self-defense, the\r\npoolroom keepers were anxious that all gamblers should be placed on the\r\nsame level; hence the anti-gambling amendment to the Constitution. Mr.\r\nTelusky, who offered the amendment as a resolution, said that if any\r\nmember of the convention “can name one man in the state of New York\r\nthat is in the bookmaking business that is not a thief, a blackguard\r\nor an ex-convict, I will withdraw my resolution. I say, Mr. President,\r\nevery bookmaker in the state of New York, no matter where he comes from,\r\nis nothing but an ex-convict, a cracksman, a pickpocket, a thief of\r\nthe lowest character, and these men come here and desire to shut this\r\n(amendment) out because the Legislature of a few years ago legalized a\r\ncertain kind of gambling, and they are trying to protect them.”\r\n\r\nMr. Edward Lauterbach paid his compliments to the racing associations in\r\nplain language. “Their nefarious establishments,” he said, “have been\r\nerected from Montauk Point to Niagara Falls, and the state treasury has\r\nreceived and distributed to the county fairs a few miserable shekels,\r\nwhich it has reserved as its share of the plunder. _Why, for every dollar\r\nthat the state has received, it has expended ten dollars to support those\r\nwho have become inmates of its prisons by reason of the weak policy so\r\npursued._ You are all familiar with the terrible temptation of this\r\nalluring vice. The passion of gambling is pandered to in this fashion in\r\nthe most insidious manner. Exaggerated accounts of great winnings are\r\npresented to the readers of every journal. Tens of thousands of young men\r\nand women have been hurled to their ruin through the instrumentality of\r\nthe state that should have protected them. Gambling has already been made\r\nunlawful. If anyone desires to legalize any one branch of gambling by the\r\nsuggestion of proposed amendment (to the anti-gambling amendment), let\r\nus say to him, Never. Let us pass this amendment, so that, once enacted\r\ninto a law, it may carry out its beneficent purpose and not prove a sham\r\nand a deceit. Just as it was as reported let us have this amendment—no\r\nsubterfuge, no change, no alterations; make no halfway work. Sweep the\r\nwhole brood together—gamblers, pool-sellers, bookmakers, all the racing\r\nfraternity—into oblivion forever. Pass this amendment now, as it is,\r\nunaltered and unchanged. True horse fanciers—the Bonners, the Lorillards,\r\nthe Belmonts, the Keenes and the rest—will thank you for the protection\r\nyou thus afford to their legitimate pursuit. Only the gambler, who should\r\nbe a pariah and an outcast, and not the state’s associate, will have\r\ncause for regret.”\r\n\r\nIt was said at the time that the racing associations and the bookmakers\r\nhad collected a fund of $700,000, and intended to use it in buying enough\r\nvotes in the convention to defeat the anti-gambling amendment. Who said\r\nit? The newspapers. True? Not at all likely. The racing associations\r\nwere able to raise such a fund, but would have got little assistance\r\nfrom the bookmakers. The latter were an asset of the racing associations\r\nand knew it; they must be taken care of. ’Twas said, when Mr. Jerome was\r\nat Albany championing the Dowling bill, that the gamblers of New York\r\nhad contributed $100,000 for the purchase of the Black Horse Cavalry\r\nin the Legislature. The press gave Troy as the headquarters of the\r\ngamblers’ committee. There was no such committee. The gamblers of New\r\nYork, including Canfield, who had more at stake than any other gambler,\r\ndid not contribute a dollar for the purpose of killing the Dowling bill.\r\nThe latter was passed with surprising ease in Assembly and Senate, and\r\nhad become a law before the “clever division” had begun to think of the\r\npossibility of such a result. This law, in the hands of Mr. Jerome, has\r\nproved rather embarrassing to the gambling fraternity, and may give him\r\nan opportunity of distinguishing himself in a manner after his own heart\r\nbefore many weeks have passed.\r\n\r\nThe anti-gambling amendment to the Constitution was ratified by a popular\r\nmajority of nearly 90,000 votes. Some of the voters believed, doubtless,\r\nthat it would eliminate betting on race-tracks. These forgot that the\r\namendment was of little worth unless the Legislature made such gambling\r\nan offense and also made a punishment to fit the offense. The Legislature\r\nwhich followed the adoption of the Constitution was “open to reason.”\r\nHow much money was required to salve its conscience I do not know, but\r\nthe manner in which it replied to the demand of the popular vote shows\r\nthat it was dishonest. By the anti-gambling clause of the Constitution\r\nit was ordered to “pass appropriate laws to prevent offenses against any\r\nof the provisions of this section.” Instead of obeying such mandate it\r\nadopted the Percy-Gray law, which makes gambling in poolrooms a felony\r\nand gambling on race-tracks a misdemeanor. In other words, if the keeper\r\nof a poolroom takes a bet on a horse race he commits a felony and can be\r\nsent to jail, for according to the law he has committed a penal offense,\r\nwhereas if a bookmaker accepts your money on the same race he does not\r\ncommit a felony and you are at liberty to publish yourself as a poor sort\r\nof creature by attempting to recover your money by civil action. Class\r\nlegislation? It looks like it. But class legislation is unconstitutional.\r\nThat is the general opinion, but in this particular case many thousands\r\nof dollars have been spent in an effort to discover whether or not the\r\npresent racing law is unconstitutional, and the dollars have been thrown\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThe situation would be amusing did it not demonstrate the power of money.\r\nTo the average mind it would seem as if the constitutional convention had\r\nbarred all kinds of gambling, particularly gambling on race-tracks. Yet,\r\nunder the fostering care of the Racing Trust, the volume of gambling at\r\nrace-tracks is at least thrice as great today as it was in 1895. Before\r\nthe convention met the Racing Trust was permitted to do business for five\r\nmonths in the year; now it does business for seven months. Under the\r\nIves Pool law, which was wiped out as vicious, the tracks were limited\r\nto thirty days of racing; now the Jockey Club does as it pleases in the\r\nmatter of dates. Under a law which is, upon its face, unconstitutional\r\nbecause it discriminates, the Racing Commission, a state institution, has\r\nthe power to issue or refuse licenses. The Racing Commission is under the\r\ncontrol of the Jockey Club, and the latter is the ruler of the racing\r\nassociations. The Jockey Club, of which Mr. August Belmont is the head,\r\nis lord of all it surveys in the metropolitan circuit, to say nothing of\r\nthe Bennings race-track, in which a majority of the stock is owned by\r\nMr. Belmont. Racing began at Bennings on March 23, and its dates are not\r\nincluded in the seven months of racing in the metropolitan circuit.\r\n\r\nIn this circuit there are seven tracks, not counting the Buffalo track,\r\nwhich is controlled by the Racing Trust. The track at Morris Park, the\r\nmost picturesque race-course in the United States, has been relegated\r\nto obscurity, as it was not owned by the Racing Trust, but was leased\r\nat an annual rental of $45,000. Belmont Park, which is owned by Mr.\r\nAugust Belmont, the head of the Racing Trust, has taken its place. The\r\nassociations which are controlled by the Racing Trust are capitalized as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    Westchester Racing Association (Belmont Park)    $1,500,000\r\n    Queens County Jockey Club (Aqueduct)                700,000\r\n    Metropolitan jockey Club (Jamaica)                  550,000\r\n    Coney Island Jockey Club (Sheepshead Bay)           525,000\r\n    Brooklyn Jockey Club (Gravesend)                    500,000\r\n    Brighton Beach Racing Association                   300,000\r\n    Buffalo Racing Association                          200,000\r\n    Saratoga Association for the Improvement\r\n      of the Breed of Horses                             50,000\r\n                                                     ----------\r\n           Total                                     $4,325,000\r\n\r\nThese figures were obtained from the Secretary of State, the Hon. John\r\nF. O’Brien. In any calculations that may be made the capitalization\r\nof Belmont Park should be eliminated and the rental of Morris Park,\r\n$45,000, substituted for $1,500,000, in order to show how thriving a\r\nconcern the Racing Trust is. It will be understood, of course, that the\r\ncapitalization of these concerns may be a trifle, just a trifle, higher\r\nthan the actual value of the said tracks and appurtenances, except in the\r\ncase of the Saratoga track, which was built solely “for the improvement\r\nof the breed of horses.”\r\n\r\nFor the right to do business on these tracks the Racing Trust pays, or is\r\nsupposed to pay, to the state five per cent. upon the gross earnings of\r\nsaid tracks. Among the duties of the Racing Commission is the supervision\r\nof these receipts. The commission consists of Messrs. August Belmont,\r\nJohn Sanford and E. D. Morgan. Mr. Belmont is the president of the\r\nWestchester Racing Association (Belmont Park), and the largest owner of\r\nstock in the Racing Trust. Mr. Sanford is the power at Saratoga, and\r\ndoes not race until the season opens at the Spa. Attached to the Racing\r\nCommission is a State Inspector of Races. Until he was appointed to a\r\nposition in the Internal Revenue Department the place was filled by\r\nCharles W. Anderson, a colored man. Reports of gross receipts are made\r\nto the State Comptroller by the racing associations and by the State\r\nInspector of Races. It is not impossible that the latter official takes\r\nsuch figures as are offered to him, and it is difficult to imagine that\r\nhe ever objected to them on the score of inaccuracy or any other score.\r\n\r\nThe reports of gross receipts made by the members of the Racing Trust to\r\nthe State Comptroller for the years 1900, 1901, 1902, 1903 and 1904 are\r\nas follows (the figures were obtained from the State Comptroller, the\r\nHon.

The reader will notice,\r\nalso, that the gross receipts for last year were $209,215.37 less than\r\nthose of 1903, though the press was unanimous in declaring that last\r\nyear’s racing was the greatest, which means the most profitable of all\r\nyears. The five per cent. paid to the state last year by the Racing Trust\r\namounted to $190,256.27. This five per cent. is “the penny in the dollar”\r\nalluded to by Mr. Edward Lauterbach in his address to the constitutional\r\nconvention. But ridiculously small as it is, why does the Racing Trust\r\ngive it to the state? Simply as a sop to the rural legislator and his\r\nconstituents. The dweller in cities may lack some or many of the virtues,\r\nbut when it is necessary to find the highest plane of parsimonious\r\nhypocrisy one must needs pay a visit to the rural districts. This five\r\nper cent., which smacks so much of Iscariot’s thirty pieces of silver,\r\nis divided among such agricultural societies as give annual fairs, and\r\nto farmers’ institutes. Ostensibly it is intended for the improvement\r\nof agriculture; in reality much of it is given as purses for trotting\r\nraces at the said county fairs. Without the support of the rural element\r\nthe Racing Trust would not have succeeded in getting the adoption of the\r\nPercy-Gray racing law.\r\n\r\nThe profits of the Racing Trust are enormous. Take the Coney Island\r\nJockey Club, for instance. Mr. Leonard Jerome, who was a sportsman who\r\nnever made money out of sport, built the Sheepshead Bay track at a\r\ncost of $125,000. The grounds of the Coney Island Jockey Club belong\r\nto the people and were filched from them by an act of the Legislature.\r\nImprovements were made since the track was built, but the actual legal\r\nbelongings of the Coney Island Jockey Club are worth far less than the\r\namount of the capital stock, which is $525,000. The gross receipts of\r\nthe club for last year, as reported to the State Comptroller, were\r\n$854,421.20. Of what did these consist? It was said that the attendance\r\non “big days” last year numbered from 40,000 to 50,000. Put it at 35,000,\r\nand the money taken in for admission, boxes and clubhouse seats and boxes\r\nand for “field” admissions would amount to about $80,000. Then there are\r\nthe bookmakers. On more than one day last year there were 120 members of\r\nthe Metropolitan Turf Association in the ring. They paid $57 each for the\r\nprivilege of “laying the odds.” Back of them were a hundred layers who\r\npaid $37 each. There were fifty others who paid $27, and as many more who\r\npaid $17 each. Programs to the number of 40,000 at ten cents each make\r\n$400. Then there are the bar and restaurant privileges, the commissioners\r\nand many other means of income, so that the income of one such day could\r\nnot be less than $100,000.\r\n\r\nThere were thirty days of racing at Sheepshead Bay last year.\r\nThe attendance, according to the daily press, was “enormous,”\r\n“record-breaking,” “large” or “highly satisfactory.” The “highly\r\nsatisfactory” days were the smallest of the season, which shows the\r\ndifference between English as it is understood by “sporting” writers in\r\nthe daily press and those who are able to distinguish the difference\r\nbetween fact and fancy. If the average daily attendance were not more\r\nthan 12,500, it and the other sources of revenue would mean about $35,000\r\nper day.\r\n\r\n    Thirty days’ racing at $35,000 per day               $1,050,000\r\n    Expenses of all kinds at $10,000 per day                300,000\r\n                                                           --------\r\n        Balance in favor of the club                       $750,000\r\n\r\nThe sum of $10,000 per day will cover all the expenses, including added\r\nmoney, at Sheepshead Bay. According to such calculation and taking the\r\nclub’s figures of gross receipts as correct, the result would be like\r\nthis:\r\n\r\n    Receipts for thirty days’ racing                    $854,421.20\r\n    Expenses for thirty days’ racing at $10,000 per day  300,000.00\r\n                                                        -----------\r\n        Balance in favor of the club                    $554,421.20\r\n\r\nThese figures show that the profits of the Coney Island Jockey Club for\r\n_thirty days_ of racing are more than the full amount of its capital\r\nstock. Some years ago, when racing was conducted on a smaller scale, this\r\nstock paid 56 per cent. per annum. Unless a lot of money is packed away\r\nin a reserve fund, the stock should pay dollar for dollar now, and the\r\nstate still gets the “penny in the dollar.”\r\n\r\nMuch of the income was contributed by the chief factors at a\r\nrace-course—the men who own and race horses; and one of the most\r\ninteresting features of a race meeting, to members of the Racing Trust,\r\nis the fact that the men who own the horses are racing for money\r\ncontributed, in great part, by themselves. The money added by the racing\r\nassociations is often less than the amounts furnished by owners of\r\nhorses that have been entered for a race. Much stress is laid upon the\r\nfact that $2,601,160 was won in purses last year on the tracks of the\r\nmetropolitan circuit and Bennings. This amount, large as it may seem, was\r\nso distributed that very few owners paid much more than expenses, while a\r\nfar larger number lost much money. Four hundred and thirty-eight stables\r\nor owners were among the winners, and a glance at the following table\r\nwill show that the losers were in a large majority.\r\n\r\n    OWNERS AND WINNINGS\r\n\r\n    Herman B.

Some of these stables had as many as a dozen starters who “figured\r\nin the money.” Stables or owners to the number of 217 won between $100\r\nand $1,000 each. Of this number fifty-four were in the $100 class. The\r\naverage winnings for the 438 stables were $5,938, which sum tells a\r\ndoleful tale for a majority of them, as the expenses of one thoroughbred\r\nand its owner for a year cannot well be squeezed into $5,938, unless the\r\nhorse’s diet is restricted to hay and the owner lives at a Mills hotel.\r\nMr. Keene’s winnings were $164,940. That amount about paid his racing\r\nexpenses for the year.\r\n\r\nAll of which, I think, goes to prove that the Racing Trust is more\r\nanxious to make and increase enormous profits than to improve the\r\nbreed of horses. And everybody is aware that such enormous profits are\r\nmade only by violation of the Constitution of the state, and that,\r\nwhile gambling in poolrooms and elsewhere has been made difficult and\r\ndangerous, no effort has been made by the authorities to interfere with\r\nit on the tracks of the Racing Trust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _Dependence_\r\n\r\n\r\n    Not that there are not “other eyes\r\n      In Spain” as bright as yours can be,\r\n    But that no eyes in all the world\r\n      Can ever seem as bright to me.\r\n\r\n    Not that there are not lips as sweet\r\n      Kissed daily by each separate wind,\r\n    But that no other lips to me\r\n      Can seem so sweet, can be so kind.\r\n\r\n    Sweetheart, I own myself your slave\r\n      Because you own yourself my thrall;\r\n    I—with so little, dear, to give;\r\n      You—who so gladly give me all.\r\n\r\n                 REGINALD WRIGHT KAUFFMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _What Buzz-Saw Morgan Thinks_\r\n\r\n                             BY W.

Why,\r\nthen, should they object to a little of the “freezing” process, if the\r\nGovernment or states decide to go into the oil business on their own\r\naccount?\r\n\r\nIf the Socialists insist on turning the world over at one flip, like\r\nturning a pancake, before they can start the show, they are following\r\na mighty cold trail. If they are willing to go by the usual road of\r\nevolution there is no reason why they and the Populists should not work\r\ntogether, for awhile at least.\r\n\r\nThe man who is wholly controlled by sentiment is not fit to vote. Voting\r\nis a business proposition and demands both intelligence and good judgment.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be the policy of lawmakers in this country to grant special\r\nprivileges to the rich and powerful, and to permit them to impose upon\r\nthe weak, and this condition will remain just so long as men will submit\r\nto being robbed.\r\n\r\nThe men who prate most about “vested rights” and “law and order” are the\r\nones who violate them most.\r\n\r\nWhen the Government thought the express companies were charging\r\nthe people too much for the transmission of money it went into the\r\nmoney-order business itself. What was the result? Why, the express\r\ncompanies had to come to the rate established by the Government or get\r\nnone of the business. It was purely a matter of business, and that’s the\r\nway to do it.\r\n\r\nIt was the “battle-scared” bag barons that discredited government paper\r\nmoney during the Civil War between the states. Yet it is from these men\r\nthat we hear most about “national honor” and “public credit.” They are\r\nthe same class of men of whom honest old Abe Lincoln said: “They ought to\r\nbe hanged”; and the country would have fared better ever since if they\r\nhad been.\r\n\r\nNearly every civilized nation in the world owns all or a part of its\r\nsystem of railroad and telegraph lines, and they have no disposition to\r\nturn them over to private corporations. The United States alone permits\r\na few wealthy buccaneers to levy taxes on the people which no government\r\nwould dare do. An increase of three cents per bushel on corn alone means\r\na tax of fifty millions of dollars to the men who produce that cereal.\r\n\r\nUntil recently the national bankers paid the Government one per cent. on\r\nthe money the Government loaned them. Then they claimed that it was too\r\nmuch to pay for the use of the money and the credit of the Government,\r\nand Congress reduced the rate to one-half of one per cent. But the banker\r\nhas no conscientious scruples about loaning this money to the people at\r\neight and ten per cent.\r\n\r\nThe railroad companies admit that they violate the law by granting\r\nrebates, but set up the claim that if they did not do it they would lose\r\ntheir share of the traffic. It is a very singular plea. It is not half as\r\njust as the one that a man steals because he is hungry, or because his\r\nwife and children are suffering for the necessaries of life. “We violate\r\nthe law because somebody else does,” say the railroad companies. Suppose\r\nthat every criminal would set up the same excuse for the commission of\r\ncrime. And ordinary criminals have a better right to make that plea in\r\npalliation for their crime than the trusts and corporations have. If, as\r\nthey admit, the railroad managers are so dishonest that one must violate\r\nthe law because another does, if there is no way to restrain them except\r\nto turn the whole matter over to them, and permit them to pool their\r\nearnings so that one thief can watch the other thieves, it is about time\r\nto abolish the whole system of private ownership and for the Government\r\nto take charge of the lines of transportation. The railroad companies\r\nmake out the worst kind of a case against themselves. They admit that\r\nthere are enough law-breakers among them to demoralize the whole system.\r\n\r\nThe public has heard a good deal about legislation that would discourage\r\ncapital from being invested in the state enacting the legislation. It has\r\nbeen said that the passage of laws calculated to regulate the business\r\nof large corporations would have the effect of driving them away. Kansas\r\njust now is giving us an object-lesson along this line. The laws recently\r\npassed by the Legislature in that state are perhaps the most drastic in\r\ntheir nature ever passed by any state for the control and regulation\r\nof corporations, yet the prospect is that more capital will go to that\r\nstate than ever before. Although the state is now engaged in building an\r\noil refinery, there are several other independent refineries projected,\r\nwith a good prospect for more to come. It is evident that capital has\r\nnot as much to fear from the people, when it is legitimately invested\r\nand operated, as it has from the arrogant aggressions of such enormous\r\nconcerns as the Standard Oil Company that will brook no competition. If\r\ncapital will be satisfied with a fair profit it has nothing to fear from\r\nthe people, while, on the other hand, independent concerns that operate\r\nlegitimately in any line of business have much to fear from the great\r\ntrusts that have been built up through favors granted them by railroads\r\nand municipalities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Flying the Kite_\r\n\r\n\r\nHUDSON—Do you think they will be able to get along on $10,000 a year?\r\n\r\nBUDSON—They ought to.

While the Fairs are entertaining a few old\r\n      friends at dinner, Kate, not knowing that it contains Mrs.\r\n      Fair’s blood-stained dress, is about to hide a parcel in the\r\n      chest when she is startled by the entrance of Samuel Ferret,\r\n      a detective from Scotland Yard. He tells her that he, with\r\n      other detectives, is shadowing the foreign gentleman who\r\n      came to the Fair house that day and has not yet left it. He\r\n      persuades Kate to promise that she will follow the suspect\r\n      when he leaves the house and then report at Scotland Yard. As\r\n      soon as Ferret is gone she lifts the lid off the chest, drops\r\n      the package into it, and, with a shriek, falls fainting to\r\n      the floor. Mr. and Mrs. Fair run to her aid. On being revived\r\n      Kate goes to Scotland Yard, where, in her anxiety to shield\r\n      Maxwell Fair from suspicion, she inadvertently leads the\r\n      detectives to think that a crime has been committed at the\r\n      Fair house. The two detectives are piecing together the real\r\n      facts from the clues she has given, when Ferret is summoned\r\n      to the telephone by his associate Wilson, whom he had left on\r\n      guard in the home of the Fairs.\r\n\r\n“Hello, Wilson!” He began speaking to his distant lieutenant. “Yes—yes.\r\nNo? By George! Yes, yes. Good, good! With you in ten minutes.”\r\n\r\nHe hung up the receiver and to Sharpe’s impatient gesture replied:\r\n“Wilson says the quarry is up. Mendes the Cuban has just left the house,\r\nwith Thorpe following to see where he goes. And now there’s the very\r\ndevil to pay. Wilson is hot on the trail. So I’m off.”\r\n\r\n“If anything goes wrong, call me up,” said Sharpe, keenly enjoying the\r\nplay of the big fish that he would have safely landed by a day or two.\r\n\r\n“Right you are! Ta, ta!”\r\n\r\nFerret lost no time in reaching the Fair mansion. The guests were still\r\nat dinner and he could see no trace of excitement from without. Wilson\r\nreported in detail the sudden appearance of the Cuban, his hurried flight\r\nup the street with Thorpe at his heels—and all quiet inside.\r\n\r\n“Who the devil fired that shot, and at whom was it fired, and what did\r\npretty Kate mean by her stammering protests that no crime had been done?\r\nWas the saucy little minx deeper after all than they thought?” asked\r\nFerret of himself. He must have a good look at that library—that was the\r\nkey to the thickening mystery. So he stole up the stairs, but before he\r\ncould investigate the fatal library he heard the family coming up from\r\ndinner and fled to the attic, passing Kate’s door, which stood ajar, and\r\nthrough which he saw her on her knees with her face buried on the bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nAs those whose memories run back thirty years know, Sir Nelson Poynter\r\nowes his baronetcy to his financial ability and the fact that he made\r\nhis huge fortune honestly and always stood ready to sacrifice himself at\r\ntimes of threatened panic on ’Change. Essentially a “City man,” when he\r\nbecame a country gentleman he established himself in Surrey, where he\r\ncould keep an eye on Capel Court and reach the office in a little time.\r\n\r\nTo Drayton Hall, his princely mansion, it might be objected that it\r\nwas a trifle too pretentious, with its battlements and towers, but no\r\nfault could be found either with its hospitality or with the kindly old\r\ngentleman and dear old lady who dispensed it. A week-end at Drayton was\r\nalways charming.\r\n\r\nOn the terrace at Drayton on the day following that on which so much had\r\ntranspired at Fair’s town house, Travers was smoking and reading the\r\npaper, when Allyne sauntered out of a window and approached him.\r\n\r\n“What! Not gone to church with the rest, Travers?” he said reprovingly.\r\n\r\n“Dry up, idiot!” replied Travers, not looking up from his paper. “Church?\r\nWhy, hang it, did you ever hear the curate here read? He’s the worst I\r\never heard—except the vicar himself. And their sermons—lord! I wonder\r\nwhere Poynter ever unearthed these two mummies.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, come, I say; no heresy now,” protested Allyne, sitting on the\r\nbalustrade of the terrace. “But, I say, old chap,” he added, knocking the\r\nnewspaper out of Travers’s hand, “what a funk poor Fair has got into!\r\nWhat the deuce is in the wind, anyway?”\r\n\r\n“Give it up,” answered Travers, growing serious at once; “but I know one\r\nthing. You and I have some decidedly nasty experience of some sort in\r\nstore for us tonight, see if we haven’t. You are going up to town with\r\nhim this afternoon, he tells me. So am I.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered Allyne, also grown serious; “he wants us to spend the\r\nnight with him in Carlton House Terrace—going over his papers, that sort\r\nof thing. The poor devil is regularly bowled over for some reason. Queer\r\nturn for him to take—the coolest man I ever met, you know. I’m half\r\ninclined to believe that the speculative strain of the last year has been\r\ntoo much for him—in fact, that his mind is threatened; I do indeed.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense!” exclaimed Travers impatiently. “And for heaven’s sake, don’t\r\nlet him suspect that you feel in any such way about it! Why, man, he\r\ncares no more about the ups and downs on ’Change than you care about\r\nmy books. I was with him the day he dropped eighty thousand pounds in\r\nKaffirs a few years ago, and I could not get him to care about it as much\r\nas he should have done, for it was no laughing matter with him at that\r\ntime. No, Allyne, my boy, Fair’s troubles are not financial—and as for\r\nwomen——”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that’s the difficulty,” broke in Allyne. “If it were almost any\r\nother man, one might say, ‘Find the lady in the puzzle’; but Fair is an\r\niced edition of Sir Galahad. But whatever it is, he has a horror of some\r\nkind eating out that big, warm, pure heart of his. And, Travers, old man,\r\nwe must get at the truth tonight and save him.”\r\n\r\n“Right you are,” answered Travers heartily; “but I have my doubts as to\r\nour ability to get inside of him. He’s so beastly—But hush—here they come\r\nfrom church.”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke Fair and Lady Poynter strolled quietly up the gravel path\r\ntoward the terrace, followed shortly by Sir Nelson, who was pointing out\r\nhis splendid flowers to Mrs. March.\r\n\r\n“Good morning,” said Travers and Allyne in concert, rising to meet them.\r\n\r\n“You naughty boys,” scolded little old Lady Poynter, shaking a finger at\r\nthe unregenerate pair. “Not at church—and such a lovely sermon, too!”\r\n\r\n“All about loving one another,” commented Mrs. March, coming up. “Lovely?\r\nI should say so.”\r\n\r\n“And delivered in a voice of tepid silk,” remarked Fair, with so much\r\nspirit that Travers and Allyne looked at each other relieved.\r\n\r\n“By Jove, you know, the vicar’s voice is a bit trying after the first\r\nfive minutes, is it not?” said Sir Nelson, who invariably slumbered after\r\nthe period he mentioned, during the sermon.\r\n\r\n“Well, trying or not, we all eat, do we not?” remarked Lady Poynter.\r\n“So I’m off to hurry luncheon, for I want you all to drive over to the\r\nDerwents’ this afternoon, and I can’t persuade Mr. Fair to stop tonight.\r\nIn half an hour—and till then be good.”\r\n\r\nThe good old soul went away into the house to stir up the servants, and\r\nSir Nelson, taking Fair’s arm, said: “Fair, what was it you wanted to\r\nsay?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes,” answered Fair, smiling; “if Mrs. March will forgive me for\r\nleaving her to be bored by these two schoolboys, I’ll have a little chat\r\nwith you, Sir Nelson, in the library.”\r\n\r\n“Pray don’t mind me,” jauntily returned Mrs. March. “I am going to send\r\nMr. Allyne off to the church to fetch my prayer-book, which I left there,\r\nand Mr. Travers and I always get on famously. Trot away, all of you.”\r\n\r\n“Come on, Fair,” growled Sir Nelson, pulling at Fair’s sleeve. “Allyne,\r\nyou seem to be in luck—it’s only two miles to the church! Come, Fair.”\r\n\r\nThey walked along the terrace, and Allyne, glaring at Mrs. March, vaulted\r\nover the balustrade and began the hot walk to the parish church through\r\nthe park.\r\n\r\nWhen he was out of sight Travers ventured to turn to Mrs. March, who\r\nhad remained annoyingly silent, although, he felt, she must know, after\r\nreceiving his letter by the hands of her maid that morning, that his\r\nreason for desiring to see her was as great as his diffidence in stating\r\nit.\r\n\r\nHe looked long at her and wondered how she could be so cruel—and so\r\nbeautiful. At last she looked up at him as if only now realizing that he\r\nwas there.\r\n\r\n“Now, my dear Dick, we can have our little say without any such\r\nridiculous rendezvous as you suggested in your overwrought note. What\r\nseems to weigh upon us? Tell me—that is, if you think you must.”\r\n\r\n“Mrs. March—” he began, but she stopped him with a protesting hand.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. March?” she complained, with a delightful little contraction of\r\nher brows. “I thought we had agreed that I was to be the Dorothy of our\r\nchildhood?”\r\n\r\n“If you like,” he answered, saying to himself that if she knew what\r\nwas in his mind and intended to deny him, then the cruelty of her\r\npresent tormenting winsomeness was beyond belief. No. She could not be\r\nso base—she must know what he was about to say to her. But failure had\r\ngrown into the very marrow of his bones, so it was with unspeakably\r\nhopeless hope that he went on. “If you like. Well, Dorothy, it will be\r\nno news to you—this that I am now to tell you—I love you. I am sure you\r\nmust have known this for a long time. You have also known, I trust, why\r\nI have remained silent. I had the best possible of all reasons for not\r\nspeaking—I was a beggar without a penny, without a lucrative calling and\r\nwithout prospects.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Dick, Dick,” Mrs. March broke in, taking his hand in both of hers;\r\n“are you going to spoil our dear old partnership in this way? I’m so\r\nsorry! Be a dear, good boy, tell me of your new play. Have you finished\r\nit yet? I’m sure it will prove a tremendous success.”\r\n\r\n“No,” he returned rather sharply, “no; you must hear me, Dorothy. No man\r\ncan associate with you long without growing to think of you as a woman\r\naltogether different from others. You are the cleverest woman in London.\r\nYou fascinate because you puzzle and mystify men. Even women cannot\r\nresist you. They are attracted to you much as the men are—because they\r\ndo not comprehend you, because they find you different. But, Dorothy, my\r\nlove for you draws its inspiration from a source wholly unguessed by your\r\nother friends. I love you because you are the one woman in my world who\r\nsees the pathos and the meaning of life—my life and any life that fails\r\nand drowns and dies in the rush and the madness of existence. I have\r\ndiscovered the real you—the you behind the clever, fashionable, worldly\r\nMrs. March—and I claim you by right of discovery.”\r\n\r\n“Why, Dick, what nonsense!” she cried, with a not very successful effort\r\nto smile down the tears that his searching look and his throbbing words\r\nhad brought to those great hazel eyes of hers. “What nonsense! I am\r\nonly an ambitious woman of the world, happy in the possession of social\r\ninfluence. I am hard and cold and calculating—and anyhow, really, dear,\r\ndear boy, you must not think of this any more. I mean it.”\r\n\r\n“To some you may seem worldly,” he went on, ignoring her protest; “but I\r\nknow you. And I was forgetting to justify myself by telling you that I\r\nnow have the right to speak. I am no longer penniless, Dorothy. I am now\r\nin a position to ask you to share my life on the plane to which you are\r\naccustomed. Will you listen?”\r\n\r\n“I must not—I cannot—don’t be cruel, Dick,” she answered. “And aren’t you\r\na bit hard on me when you imply that I would listen to you now, but that\r\nI would not have done so when you were poor? Am I so mercenary?”\r\n\r\n“No,” he said warmly; “but I should have despised myself had I spoken\r\nwhen I had not the means to support you. Dorothy, my love for you began\r\nthe night you had that poor Bohemian boy play the violin at your little\r\nparty. The idiots who crowded your rooms gambled all the time the\r\nmarvelous lad was playing; but I saw you whisper to him when he finished\r\none sublime number, and noted how his thin, white face lighted up with\r\ngratitude and hope at whatever it was you said to him. Well, you know\r\nhe died of consumption in my chambers a few months afterward. Among his\r\npapers I found the letter you wrote him inclosing ten pounds. That letter\r\nrevealed you to me. It was glorious! It was you! From that time I have\r\nloved you with a love passing the love of women. Poverty, which until\r\nthat time had seemed rather a welcome refuge and protection to me, now\r\nbecame a hell, for it alone barred me from the hope of speaking to you.\r\nBut today I am a comparatively rich man. Dorothy, be my wife.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Dick, Dick, this is awful—don’t!” she cried, shrinking from him.\r\n“Pray, pray, stop—really you must not go on!”\r\n\r\nBut Travers had waited too long and too yearningly for this hour to be\r\nlightly deterred from stating his whole case. So he proceeded eagerly:\r\n“You heard last night of Fair’s phenomenal success? Well, he told me\r\nafter you had gone that it had also made me rich. Some time ago he bought\r\nmy poor father’s library from me—more to assist me than from any need\r\nof those particular books—and I left the money with him for investment.\r\nHe now tells me that he bought Empire Mines shares with it and that my\r\nprofits amount to fifty thousand pounds sterling. Of course I thought\r\nthat this was merely a bit of his wonderful generosity and altogether\r\nan afterthought—the result of that erratic and impulsive unselfishness\r\nwhich puzzles all who know him—but he assures me that he can prove from\r\nhis broker’s books that he bought stock for my account at the time that\r\nhe purchased his own, before it was at all certain that it would turn out\r\nsuch a staggering success. At all events, there the money is to my credit\r\nat Burton’s bank.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I am so glad, dear fellow!” cried Mrs. March. “What a king he is!”\r\n\r\n“Isn’t he? A knight, a brother—one in a million!”\r\n\r\n“Well, Dick,” went on Mrs. March after her first flush of pleasure and\r\nsurprise, “I can’t tell you how I rejoice with you in this great good\r\nfortune; but truly, dearest friend, our love can never be more than that\r\nof two tried old friends who have known each other always. So be good.”\r\n\r\n“Only one thing can ever make me believe that love like mine will be\r\ndenied,” replied Travers with great intensity; “I shall press my sacred\r\nclaim, Dorothy, until you tell me that there is another whom you love.”\r\n\r\nMrs. March waited in evident distress for a few moments, and then,\r\nspeaking very low and painfully:\r\n\r\n“Poor old Dick, it hurts me terribly to wound you—but, Dick, there is\r\nanother. I am not free.”\r\n\r\n“Good God!” leaped from the man’s lips as he started forward with the\r\niron entering his soul. “Mrs. March—with all my heart I beg you to forget\r\nme and my mad words of this day. I—I—I— Good-bye!”\r\n\r\n“God bless you!” she murmured, crushed by his suffering. “And, Dick, of\r\ncourse I have told you this in confidence.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” he answered, raising his hat and moving toward the house. At\r\nthe window of the library he stopped, and then came slowly back to where\r\nshe stood thinking. “Tell me one thing more. Dorothy, it is not this\r\nclown Allyne, is it?”\r\n\r\nMrs. March thanked him with her eyes for this bit of humor, which she\r\nknew must have cost him much, and exclaimed, with an effort to meet his\r\nown pleasantry: “Heavens! No!”\r\n\r\n“Thank goodness for that,” replied Travers, with a sickly smile. “I could\r\nnot have borne that,” and he rushed off into the house to face final\r\nfailure on the one only day when success seemed to have dawned dimly with\r\nmore of promise than had ever shone in the east of his hope.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nFreddy Allyne, as he was called by his friends, whose name was legion,\r\nprided himself upon having established a reputation for levity, when his\r\nreal character was that of a philosopher strongly inclined to pessimism.\r\nOn no one did he enjoy palming a false idea of himself more than on\r\nhimself. Life has many of these jesters whose motley serves but poorly\r\nto hide from others, and not at all from themselves, the fact that this\r\nfool is as wise as some whom he could mention and whom it is the delight\r\nof his soul to play with as he chooses. Between him and the clever woman\r\nwho was now standing on the terrace at Drayton Hall there had always\r\nbeen kept up a particularly active warfare, for Mrs. March was the one\r\nwoman in London who did not fear him, and, while this nettled him and\r\nsometimes seriously annoyed him, it fascinated and led him on. A score of\r\ntimes the wise had foretold a speedy match between these two, who were\r\nnever so widely parted at a dinner-table but they pursued each other\r\nwithout quarter to the very finish of an argument.\r\n\r\nUntil quite recently Mrs. March herself had vaguely but persistently\r\nassumed that Allyne would declare himself sooner or later, and at that\r\ntime had somewhat doubted her ability to deny the man whose brilliant\r\nintellect, generous impulses and fundamentally noble nature had come to\r\nmean more to her than she dared or wished to allow herself to realize.\r\nBut some little time before this Allyne observed that a change had come\r\nto pass and that she held herself distinctly aloof from him whenever\r\nthey were alone, and had even gone so far as to refuse to be at home to\r\nhim unless she was certain that others would be by. He interpreted this\r\ndeparture as evidence of her feeling that the time had arrived when their\r\nfriendship must go further—or safeguard itself by greater restraint.\r\n\r\nFrom a safe distance in the park he had watched her as she and Travers\r\ntalked—with not the remotest notion of the subject they were discussing.\r\nWhen at last he saw Travers raise his hat formally and retire into the\r\nhouse, and Mrs. March remain leaning against the parapet on the terrace,\r\nhe thought the hour had come.\r\n\r\n“What? Back so soon?” cried Mrs. March, seeing him coming across the\r\nstretch of lawn toward her. “You do walk fast, don’t you?”\r\n\r\n“The church was shut,” replied Allyne, with his customary bantering tone\r\nand approaching close to her. “Yes, the church was shut, and I fed the\r\nswans in the pond instead.”\r\n\r\n“But you surely have not walked four miles and fed swans all in ten\r\nminutes?” asked Mrs. March, clearing for action, and keenly appreciating\r\nthe relief that this diversion afforded to the strain of the past few\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n“Oh, dear me, no,” drawled Allyne innocently. “You see, I remembered that\r\nthey always shut churches after service, so I knew that this one would be\r\nshut. Awfully pretty swans of Poynter’s, too. Ever seen them? They float\r\nabout the pond like a lot of duchesses in a drawing-room—and fight over\r\nthe crumbs like them, also.”\r\n\r\n“And you didn’t fetch my prayer-book, after all?” she inquired\r\nreprovingly. “You _are_ a devoted squire of dames, I must say!”\r\n\r\n“It was of my devotion to the fair in general and to you in particular\r\nthat I came back to speak,” he began, unable, in spite of his firm\r\nresolution, to approach the subject except with his usual air of\r\naudacious impertinence and frivolity. “You must have observed that I\r\nbestow my society upon you in a way that causes half the beauties of\r\nthe gay world of which I am so conspicuous an ornament fairly to die of\r\njealousy. Well, my dear Mrs. March, I do so because you are the only\r\nwoman who does not bore me too much. Point by point as our acquaintance\r\ngrew I came to feel that you are as free from disqualifying features as\r\nany woman can be—in short, you know, I’ve almost made up my mind to think\r\nfairly well of you.”\r\n\r\nThen followed an interview the like of which it is safe to say has never\r\nbeen heard before or since. In substance and seriousness it was the same\r\nas Travers’s, for Allyne, too, had been suddenly made independent by\r\nFair’s investment of a small sum intrusted to him, but it was, on the\r\nsurface, only a remarkable example of his characteristic nonsensical\r\nraillery and light chaffing. That the result was the same as it had been\r\nin Travers’s case may be inferred from the fact that when he left her\r\nwith a painful effort at nonchalance he turned and came back to her to\r\nsay:\r\n\r\n“Tell me just one thing. It’s not that grave-digger, Dick Travers, is it?”\r\n\r\nMrs. March jumped at the immense relief of being able to laugh at this\r\nfling, and fairly shouted: “No—horrors!”\r\n\r\n“Thank heaven for that!” returned Allyne. “Now I sha’n’t have to commit\r\nsuicide.”\r\n\r\nWith one of his inimitable grimaces, he hurried into the house and she\r\ndid not see the solitary tear that trickled down his cheek when he shut\r\nhimself into his room and threw a pillow at his image in the mirror,\r\ncrying: “You old fool!”\r\n\r\nMrs. March stood where he had left her, and her sense of humor mercifully\r\nprevented her dwelling on the unhappy side of the situation. And it was\r\nnot until years afterward, when all three could bear to speak of it, that\r\nshe related to both of them what had occurred.\r\n\r\n“Truly Englishmen bear off the palm,” she mused after the first shock\r\nhad passed. “All other men lay their hearts at a woman’s feet—but an\r\nEnglishman condescends to let her know that he doesn’t mind allowing her\r\nto use his name if she has a mind to do so! Well, Baggs, was he there?”\r\n\r\nHer last words were addressed to her maid, who had been watching for an\r\nopportunity to approach her mistress for some minutes.\r\n\r\n“Yes, ma’am,” she answered. “But I had to wait a little while before the\r\ngentleman came. Here is a letter, ma’am.”\r\n\r\n“And what was the gentleman like?” asked Mrs. March, taking the letter.\r\n\r\n“He were a dark, foreign gentleman, ma’am, with a black mustache. He\r\nspoke Eyetalian lovely, ma’am—just lovely!”\r\n\r\nMrs. March laughed at Baggs’s discriminating appreciation of well-spoken\r\nItalian, and then remarked carelessly: “It must have been Mr.—But there,\r\nI haven’t told you his name, have I? Did the gentleman send any message\r\nby you—verbally, I mean?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, ma’am,” replied Baggs with embarrassment. “He said as how he\r\nembraced your feet, ma’am, and kissed your footsteps, ma’am, and—beg\r\npardon, ma’am—the gentleman kissed me, too, ma’am, he did.”\r\n\r\n“You mustn’t mind that, you know, Baggs,” answered Mrs. March, smiling.\r\n“You know, foreign ways are different from ours.”\r\n\r\n“They are, ain’t they just, ma’am?” assented Baggs, remembering some\r\nother things which she did not think it necessary to report—as well as\r\na more palpable evidence which she did not mind mentioning. “They is\r\ndifferent, as you say, ma’am, for the gentleman gave me a sovereign.”\r\n\r\n“That was good of him,” remarked Mrs. March. “You shall have another\r\nsovereign to put on top of that one. You will find my purse on my\r\ndressing-table—help yourself.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, thank you, thank you, ma’am,” blurted out Baggs, wondering if her\r\nlady were just right in the head.\r\n\r\n“But see here, Baggs,” said Mrs. March as the maid was about to obey her\r\nlast command and go and find the purse; “Baggs, you have been doing a\r\ngreat many confidential things for me lately. Don’t lose your head and\r\nmake yourself ridiculous now. I have done nothing about which I might\r\nnot have the whole world hear. If I were engaged in anything wrong or\r\nunseemly, do you think for a moment that I would be such a fool as to\r\nmake my servants my confidants? No. So remember that if you speak of\r\nmy affairs to anyone, you will simply lose your place and your good\r\ncharacter, and not inconvenience me in the least possible degree. Now do\r\nyou understand me?”\r\n\r\n“I understand you, ma’am, perfect,” replied Baggs, mentally calculating\r\nwhether her mistress took her for an absolute donkey or was merely joking.\r\n\r\n“I’m glad you do understand—that will do,” said Mrs. March, and Baggs\r\nwith a courtesy disappeared into the house.\r\n\r\nThe instant that she found herself alone Mrs. March tore open the letter\r\nfeverishly. She started violently at once, and when she steadied herself\r\nenough to finish reading it she fell back upon the garden seat, where\r\nshe sat in manifest consternation and doubt. For some moments she seemed\r\nto be in the clutches of a horrible anxiety which baffled all effort to\r\ndecide upon action of any sort. Then she heard voices approaching, jumped\r\nup, tearing the letter nervously into two or three pieces which fell upon\r\nthe seat beside her, and ran into the house.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER X\r\n\r\nThe voices that had frightened Mrs. March off were those of Sir Nelson\r\nand Maxwell Fair, who now came round the corner of the tower, with heads\r\nbowed in very earnest talk. The elder man had been the most intimate\r\nfriend of the younger man’s father, and on the death of the latter Sir\r\nNelson had assumed an informal guardianship of the erratic and wilful\r\nson. But while others were disappointed and baffled during the earlier\r\nyears of Maxwell Fair’s manhood, Sir Nelson Poynter swore by him and\r\npredicted that all would be well in time. Fully had Maxwell Fair’s more\r\nrecent career justified the confidence of his father’s old friend.\r\n\r\nIt was with the shock of surprise, as well as the natural sorrow of a\r\nfriend, that Sir Nelson had just been hearing Fair speak in indefinite\r\nterms of some impending catastrophe that was to terminate in blight his\r\nbrilliant and successful life.\r\n\r\n“By Jove, my boy,” Sir Nelson was saying as they reached the terrace\r\nand began pacing up and down, “it distresses me unspeakably to hear\r\nyour father’s son talking in this way. Of course, I shall do all I\r\ncan—whatever you may ask of me—but don’t you think that you should make a\r\nclean breast of everything? It is nothing new to see a Fair acting from\r\nsome high, compelling motive, which strikes us ordinary men as quixotic,\r\nbut your fathers always did whatever they did in the open. They may have\r\nbeen enthusiasts and unpractical crusaders, but nobody could complain\r\nthat they fought under a mask. Their object may sometimes have seemed\r\nchimerical, but in the struggle to reach it they wore their coat-of-arms\r\nwhere men could see it, and proclaimed their principles with trumpet\r\nblasts. Out with it, man! What in God’s name is it all?”\r\n\r\n“I thank you, Sir Nelson,” quietly replied Fair, taking up his argument\r\nand appeal at the point where Sir Nelson had interrupted him. “You\r\nhave relieved my mind by consenting to act as my executor. You will,\r\nI think, find my affairs in tolerably good order. Everything goes to\r\nMiss Mettleby—everything, so there will be little to do in the way of\r\nsettlement.”\r\n\r\n“To Miss Mettleby?” exclaimed Sir Nelson, confronting Fair with perfect\r\nconsternation and disapproval. “To Miss Mettleby, you say? She is your\r\nchildren’s governess, is she not? My God, boy, there has been no—your\r\nwife and children, you know! What will be thought of this?”\r\n\r\n“I have settled five hundred thousand pounds on Mrs. Fair and the\r\nchildren—long ago, as I think you know, so I can leave the rest to Miss\r\nMettleby with justice and propriety,” answered Fair calmly.\r\n\r\n“What if you have?” cried out Sir Nelson, growing vexed at the fellow’s\r\namazing stubbornness and lack of decency, as he thought. “What if you\r\nhave settled a considerable sum on your family? Do you suppose you can\r\nleave the bulk of your estate to a dependent girl, a young woman in your\r\nemploy, without causing no end of evil surmises and comment reflecting on\r\nyour memory—yes, and the young person’s honor? What can you mean by such\r\na mad determination? Come, be reasonable, I beg of you. Make a suitable\r\nprovision for this girl, if you think it due her for her faithful service\r\nin your family, but, for heaven’s sake, don’t leave the poor child a\r\nlegacy of defamation, as you most certainly will, if you persist in\r\ncarrying out such a preposterous course.”\r\n\r\n“By the time that you come to settle my estate, sir, I shall have become\r\nan object too contemptible for even malice to stoop to notice,” replied\r\nFair, poking his stick into the gravel and giving his words the tone\r\nthat meant that he had thought out all the objections which his old\r\nfriend had raised.\r\n\r\nThey walked back and forth once or twice before Sir Nelson responded with\r\na laugh, which he tried to make genuine: “My word, what arrant nonsense\r\nwe have been talking anyhow! Settling your estate, eh? Why, bless us all,\r\nI shall have been under the chancel stones twenty years before you retire\r\nfrom business to begin to enjoy middle age in the country. Come, come,\r\ndear fellow, pull yourself together, do!”\r\n\r\n“Ah, my best of friends,” answered Fair, with a voice full of sincerest\r\nlove and respect, but also of firmness and stem determination. “You\r\nought to know my father’s son better than to suppose that anything can\r\nswerve me from a purpose once it has become a fixed idea—but,” he added,\r\nsuddenly turning to the old man with great tenderness, “by all that is\r\nrational, I do suppose that it is unfair to keep you in the dark in this\r\nway. I think that I should tell you plainly what is in my heart.”\r\n\r\n“Depend upon it, Maxwell, it will be best for both of us if you will tell\r\nme fully and honestly—everything,” eagerly returned Sir Nelson, slapping\r\nFair on the back in that hearty, old-fashioned way of his. “Come, now,\r\nwhat the devil ails you?”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, sir,” said Fair, taking Sir Nelson’s arm and pushing him\r\nback toward the seat, “sit down while I tell you—I am too nervous to do\r\nso.”\r\n\r\nThe old man sat as he was requested, and watched his young friend as he\r\nwalked up and down before him, formulating his ideas in order to present\r\nthem clearly and consecutively. It was some time before Fair had so far\r\nshaped his thoughts as to be willing to speak. But when he had done so he\r\nstopped on his next turn in front of Sir Nelson and said very quietly:\r\n\r\n“Now I am ready. In carrying out the one compelling and absorbing purpose\r\nof my life I have been made the most wretched and most misunderstood of\r\nmen. I have sternly brushed aside love, hope, joy—everything which means\r\nlife to a passionate and intense nature like my own. But this is an old\r\nstory. I had come to think that the dwarfing and cramping restraints of\r\nmy self-imposed life-work were second nature—more, that the life I was\r\nleading was the only life possible to me. I would have died fighting for\r\nthe triumph of my idea—they would have found my body in the last trench\r\nafter the battle was done, and nobody had been the wiser, no one would\r\never have known what a falsely-true life had been mine, had not this last\r\nhorrible sacrifice been required by the insatiable purpose which has\r\nsucked away my life.\r\n\r\n“I had asked for nothing from fate, but the right to live and die with\r\nmy secret unbetrayed. I had begged of God nothing more than that I be\r\nsuffered to seal with my death the loyalty to poor Janet that I had\r\nstriven to make of my whole life. But no. Even this beggarly scrap of\r\ncomfort has been denied to me—and by the most unspeakable irony of fate,\r\nI find myself confronted with the damnable necessity of throwing away all\r\nthese dumb years of denial and self-effacement in order to do Janet and\r\nthe children the only service which still remains possible for me to do.\r\nIs it not horrible, Sir Nelson? I had thought to make my life of some\r\nlittle good by offering it to protect a woman and her children—and now,\r\nlest they be buried by my own ruin, I must undo everything that I have\r\ndone during all these years.”\r\n\r\nHe paused and looked at his old friend, who showed a growing concern that\r\nindicated he began really to believe Fair had lost his reason.\r\n\r\n“Sir Nelson, I see that you do not comprehend me—perhaps I am beginning\r\nat the wrong end. Yes, I am, of course. Let me give you some concrete\r\nfacts before asking you to follow me. Well, then, I tell you that I, your\r\nold friend’s son, the man whom you have helped and watched over, as if\r\nI were your son—I, Sir Nelson, have committed a crime against society,\r\nagainst nature, against life!”\r\n\r\n“Crime?” exclaimed the old Baronet, springing to his feet and grasping\r\nFair’s hand, thoroughly convinced that he was acting under some mental\r\nand nervous excitement that had proved too much for his reason. “Crime?\r\nGood God, boy, you are mad! I can’t believe this—I do not believe it!”\r\n\r\n“Wait, wait,” pleaded Fair, again forcing Sir Nelson to the seat, and\r\ntrying to speak with the utmost composure. “Do not misunderstand me,\r\nsir. If I had told you that I had wilfully and deliberately violated my\r\nconscience or done some blackguardly thing, I should hope that nothing\r\nwould induce you to believe me. I have done this awful thing, of which I\r\nnow confess that I am guilty, with a clean heart—if you can understand\r\nme. Society must and assuredly will wreak its sudden and fatal vengeance\r\nupon me for my crime, but I want you, sir, to believe that when men are\r\nreviling me for my act I shall be flinging that very deed at the feet of\r\nmy eternal Judge and asking Him to accept it in atonement for my blackest\r\nfaults—and if God fails to accept this thing that I have done, then am I\r\ndamned indeed forever. But you do not understand me?”\r\n\r\n“On my word, I do not!” answered Sir Nelson, filled with very serious\r\nmisgivings. “You are ill—dangerously ill.”\r\n\r\n“On the contrary,” replied Fair spiritedly, “I was never better in my\r\nlife. My mind was never so clear as it is at this moment. Listen, Sir\r\nNelson. When this crime is made public—which will be tomorrow in all\r\nlikelihood—I want you to shield Mrs. Fair and the children by announcing\r\nthat Janet is not my wife, that I never married her—and that the poor\r\nchildren are not my children at all. Do this—it is the truth—and save\r\ninnocent beings from the disgrace of being thought to be my flesh and\r\nblood.”\r\n\r\nIn spite of his efforts during this speech, Fair had yielded to the\r\nintoxication of his sublime grief, and when he ceased speaking he was\r\nholding the old man’s hand and the tears were streaming down his face.\r\n\r\n“I sha’n’t put up with this,” declared Sir Nelson with much sternness,\r\nrising like a very determined man. “I shall have Sir Porter Hope down by\r\nspecial train at once. You are bad, on my honor, very bad indeed.”\r\n\r\n“Spare Sir Porter Hope an unnecessary journey,” answered Fair, having\r\nregained control of himself. He went on laughingly: “I tell you, I am\r\nperfectly well. Have you a cigar? Thanks.”\r\n\r\nHe lighted the cigar, which poor old Sir Nelson was only too eager to\r\ngive him as an evidence that the fellow was not totally mad, and with\r\ngreat deliberation puffed it slowly and carelessly, making rings of the\r\nsmoke and praising the quality of the tobacco. Not until he had got him\r\nback to calmness and some measure of reassurance did he permit Sir Nelson\r\nto resume the discussion of the question which both of them felt was the\r\nlast one they would ever discuss—the final question of Fair’s complex and\r\nmuch agonized life.\r\n\r\n“But in heaven’s name,” began Sir Nelson, pulling Fair down on the seat\r\nbeside himself, “what is the meaning of all this? Think what rubbish you\r\nhave been asking me to believe. Janet not your wife? The children not\r\nyour children? You don’t want me to believe this! You don’t ask me to\r\nbelieve that Janet is your——”\r\n\r\n“No!” roared Fair, jumping up and with so much warmth that Sir Nelson\r\nwas frightened; “no!—and don’t say the word either! On my honor as a\r\ngentleman, I tell you, sir, that no daughter in her father’s house, no\r\nsister under her brother’s roof, was ever safer, purer, more sacredly\r\nheld than Janet has been under mine. Her children have had more than a\r\nfather’s care and love from me, and it is only to save them all from the\r\ndisgrace and odium which will attach henceforth to my name that I now ask\r\nyou to proclaim the truth—to publish the fact that my polluting blood\r\ndoes not run in their veins.”\r\n\r\n“But,” protested the Baronet, with manifest disgust and irritation,\r\n“what can be the explanation of this amazing state of affairs? If she is\r\nnot your wife—and not——”\r\n\r\n“Don’t say it!” again commanded Fair. “I tell you, sir, I am not in a\r\nmood to be exasperated just now—and the very word would madden me when I\r\nthink of what that woman has been to me and I to her.”\r\n\r\nSir Nelson always afterward remembered how noble and elated by an almost\r\nsupernatural uplift Fair had appeared as he stood there, warning him not\r\nto profane the tabernacled secret of his life. The old man’s heart went\r\nout to the tortured and defiant fellow.\r\n\r\n“Never fear, dear boy,” he began with a feeble voice; “I shall not speak\r\nor think it of her. But you ought to help me to speak the truth of all\r\nthis madness by telling me just what it is.”\r\n\r\nFair was deeply moved by his old friend’s sorrow and unwonted display of\r\nfeeling, so he sat down by him and warmly shook his hand. After a few\r\nmoments of quiet, he said in low, firm, deliberate tones:\r\n\r\n“Sir Nelson, pardon my weakness in showing you my heart just now, but\r\nthe fact is, sir, that I have been under a strain—and on that one point\r\nI have always been naturally sensitive. I owe you an apology also for\r\ndelaying to advise you fully and without emotion of the exact situation\r\nin which I now find myself inextricably placed. Let me tell you the whole\r\nstory. It will seem incredible to you—until you recollect that I am the\r\nson of my father and that my heritage was what you alone know that it\r\nwas.”\r\n\r\nSir Nelson blew his nose, and finding nothing particular to say, blew\r\nit again; and Fair saw something over the terrace wall that took his\r\nattention until the dear old chap said with considerable heartiness in\r\nhis voice again: “All ready, dear boy—forgive an old fellow—who loves you.\r\n\r\n“I first met Janet in Rio Janeiro, at which port her father was British\r\nConsul, and I was happily able to take the unfortunate gentleman for\r\na long cruise on my yacht when his health broke down. He died on the\r\nyacht and we buried him at sea. Janet returned to England, and, although\r\nI loved her madly, I did not speak, because that wretched Buda-Pesth\r\nescapade of mine was still unsettled. So I completely lost sight of Janet\r\nand the years passed.\r\n\r\n“Six years ago I was in a small South American seaport acting as consul\r\nfor Jack Trowbridge, who was down with yellow fever. One day when I was\r\nlazily killing time—and big flies—in the dusty, stuffy little consulate,\r\nJanet, whom I, of course, thought in England, and whom I had not seen for\r\nso long, came in.\r\n\r\n“She was a wreck. She had a boy of two or three years clinging to her\r\nskirts and a child in her arms. You may imagine, sir, my awful shock on\r\nseeing her thus. Her story was short. She had married a Cuban planter of\r\nvery large fortune in Jamaica, and after two years of suspicion and dread\r\nand suffering she had learned that the scoundrel had deceived her, that\r\nhe had a wife living in Cuba, and that, in consequence, she had no legal\r\nor other claim upon him. She was penniless. Hearing that I was cruising\r\nin those parts, she learned through the British consuls at different\r\nplaces just where I then was, and she turned to me. I made investigation\r\nand found the damnable story told her by her supposed husband only too\r\ntrue. His wife in Cuba was his only lawful wife—and Janet was a nameless\r\nand helpless victim of his lust and perfidy. I cabled for my yacht, which\r\nwas being renovated at New York, and soon had Janet and her two children\r\non their way to England.\r\n\r\n“I scarcely saw them during the long and bitterly sad voyage, but at\r\nnight, as I stood at my trick at the wheel, and in the warm, dull days\r\nas I sat smoking in silence on deck, a thought grew and grew upon me.\r\nThe little boat tossing about on the limitless waste of waters seemed\r\nto become the symbol of my aimless, drifting, worthless life. And then,\r\none glorious tropical night, with the great stars burning sublimity and\r\neternity into my heart, the blood of all my fathers seemed to rush hot\r\nand quick and insistent through all my being. I had it! I had at last\r\nfound the Purpose, the Object, the Aim for which my life yearned, the\r\nThing in waiting, for which all the common interests and passions of\r\nyoung men had failed to hold me, the One Thing, which, by absorbing my\r\nlife, by becoming my way of defying and despising the world, would prove\r\nme my father’s son.\r\n\r\n“The next day I told Janet. We were standing alone looking out over the\r\nsea—and to both of us it seemed that the sea and life and eternity were\r\nalike trackless and tending nowhither. I told her, Sir Nelson, that she\r\nshould not land in England the outcast, nameless victim of a blackguard’s\r\ninfamy, but as my proclaimed wife. Her children would never know that\r\nthey were fatherless. I had been away from home so long that I could get\r\nmyself believed when I returned with a wife and family—and the world\r\nwould never know that I was a wretched man cut off by a vow like a monk’s\r\nvow from the joys and the heart of life. That is all, Sir Nelson; that is\r\nall.”\r\n\r\n“All! All!” exclaimed Sir Nelson, grasping Fair’s hand and wringing it\r\nhotly. “My God, man, I never heard of anything quite so great! My word,\r\nsir, if you were not Tom Fair’s son, I could not believe such a sacrifice\r\nof one’s life possible!”\r\n\r\n“It is never difficult to do what one’s nature demands,” replied Fair\r\nquietly, adding with less calmness: “But it is hard to see that all these\r\nyears of work are to come to naught. My life has been wasted.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all,” retorted the old man eagerly. “Crime? Crime, you say.

SMITH\r\n\r\n\r\nMoney is a creation of law.\r\n\r\nMoney is a measure of valuable things or services.\r\n\r\nMoney is a measure of constant and ever-varying capacity.\r\n\r\nMoney is not value in itself.\r\n\r\nThe divisor measures the dividend by division.\r\n\r\nMoney measures property by division.\r\n\r\nIf the divisor increases as fast proportionately as the dividend, the\r\nquotient will remain the same.\r\n\r\nWhen the amount of money increases as fast proportionately as the\r\nproperty to be measured or divided, the average of prices will remain on\r\na level; and, although there will be constant fluctuations in price among\r\nthe different articles to be measured or divided, the average purchasing\r\nor measuring power of the measure or the unit of value will remain the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nWhen the divisor increases faster proportionately than the dividend, the\r\nquotient will become smaller.\r\n\r\nWhen the quantity of money increases faster than the property or things\r\nto be measured or divided, the average of prices will rise.\r\n\r\nWhen the average of prices rises, the measuring or purchasing power of\r\nthe unit of value becomes less.\r\n\r\nWhen the average of prices rises, there is inflation of the money or\r\ncurrency.\r\n\r\nWhen the quantity of property increases faster proportionately than the\r\namount of money, the average of prices will fall.\r\n\r\nWhen the average of prices falls, the money or currency is contracted.\r\n\r\nAll business interests are either produce interests or moneyed interests.\r\n\r\nA produce interest is an interest in which the owner receives his pay for\r\nhis labor and the use of his capital in produce.\r\n\r\nA moneyed interest is an interest in which the owners of the business\r\nreceive their pay for their labor and the use of their capital in money.\r\n\r\nA farm is a produce interest.\r\n\r\nA railroad is a moneyed interest.\r\n\r\nIf the owners of a produce interest wish any money, they sell their\r\nproduce and buy money.\r\n\r\nIf the owners of a moneyed interest wish any produce, they sell their\r\nmoney and buy produce.\r\n\r\nWhen prices rise produce interests gain.\r\n\r\nWhen produce interests gain, moneyed interests lose.\r\n\r\nWhen prices fall, moneyed interests gain.\r\n\r\nWhen moneyed interests gain, produce interests lose.\r\n\r\nMoneyed interests and produce interests cannot both gain or both lose at\r\nthe same time.\r\n\r\nWhen prices are falling, money can be hoarded without loss.\r\n\r\nWhen prices are rising, money cannot be hoarded without loss.\r\n\r\nA hoarded dollar has never yet paid for a single day’s work.\r\n\r\nIf produce interests had not first existed, moneyed interests never could\r\nhave existed.\r\n\r\n_An honest dollar is a dollar that is willing to help produce something._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _The Say of Reform Editors_\r\n\r\n\r\nUntil the people who want reform get together in an organization all\r\nof whose members are substantially agreed, and with this organization\r\nelect a President and Congress, they will never get from under the\r\nheel of monopoly.

Have these great newspapers been\r\ninformed that Mr. Hearst is sincere, is honest, in his fight against the\r\ntrusts? If so, their spontaneous and unanimous attempt to disarm him can\r\nbe accounted for. The man who attempts to tear down the screen which is\r\nheld up, mainly by these great newspapers, between the people and their\r\ndespoilers, is sure to get the vials of their wrath poured out upon his\r\nhead.—_The Dalton Herald._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne of these days there will be two Republican Parties: one for\r\ngovernment ownership of the Kansas oil refinery and one against it.\r\nWhich are you going to stay with?—_Smith Center (Kan.)

The “superior person”\r\nwill then be chiefly interesting as an exotic, to be studied and duly\r\nticketed as “rare” by those who have blood in their veins. Work is the\r\nvery soul of life; and the idler, cultivated or other, has not lived in\r\nthe past, does not live in the present, nor will he live in the future.\r\nWhen art and work are one and indivisible we shall not even ask for\r\nphilosophers to compensate us for the illusions of life.

It is upon bewilderments like these that conscious\r\nadvocates of privilege depend for dividing the forces of their enemy when\r\nsuch a division becomes vital to them.—_The Chicago Public._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was an ill-advised move when Oklahoma joined the crusade against\r\nStandard Oil.

It is easy for anybody to make money if\r\nhe controls the buying and selling price of an article the people must\r\nhave.

It\r\nmatters not what political party he may affiliate with, if he is a friend\r\nof the people, we give him our word of encouragement and Godspeed. Among\r\nDemocrats we find some notable examples of progressive statesmanship\r\nand some advocates of reform. The Republican Party is not without some\r\npublic men whose works and words give evidence of a desire to stand for\r\nthe best type of popular government. Yet every reformer in the Republican\r\nor Democratic Party has to spend too much time, energy and ammunition in\r\nfighting the enemies within the ranks of his own party. Mr. Bryan will\r\nwear his life out in trying to overcome his enemies in the so-called\r\nDemocratic Party just as John P. Altgeld wore his life away. Governor La\r\nFollette always has war on his hands with the corporation element in his\r\nown party. And now that Mr. Roosevelt has outlined a radical course, he\r\nis beset by powerful opposition from high-up Republican politicians who\r\nrepresent special interests. He will not succeed in accomplishing much\r\nso long as all his energy is taken up in fighting the enemy at home.\r\nThe very logic of events will force the radical reformers all into one\r\nparty, and then the people will have something to hope for.—_The Kansas\r\nCommoner._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPoliteness is the external part of gentility, but it is often the\r\nprincipal weapon of rascality.

Still, the people of Kansas, co-operating through\r\ntheir state government, can make it hot for the trust. The state can put\r\n$20,000,000 into the fight, and with this sum can build railroads, lay\r\npipe lines and establish dozens of oil refineries. Twenty million dollars\r\nis a big sum, but is no more than the people of Kansas pay in national\r\ntaxes every two years.—_The Missouri World._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe magazines and big dailies are doing the country a great service. They\r\nhave writers of ability; apparently these have long chafed under the\r\ngalling chains of party manacles and are now glad to be free—glad to try\r\ntheir strength and exercise their taste and talents. Populists should\r\nsecure every advantage possible, strengthen their organizations, keep\r\nthese patriots closely in touch, and at every possible point be ready\r\nshould a reaction come.\r\n\r\nAgain and again we have seen great waves of reform sweep over the land,\r\nand again and again we have seen the monopolists catch a second breath,\r\nspit on their hands and tie these good men down with party thongs and\r\nconvention rules and resolutions.\r\n\r\nOnce we felt sure of McKinley and Garfield. Tom Ewing, Carlisle, McLean,\r\nVoorhees, David Davis, hundreds and hundreds of the brightest men in the\r\nland came to the front for a time and then dropped back when a reaction\r\ncame.\r\n\r\nSome of this reaction is due to the lack of true patriotism, to a lack of\r\ncourage, fortitude; but whatever the cause may be, Populists should be\r\nprepared for the back-set and save as much advantage as possible. At the\r\npresent every man is our friend. Almost without an exception the great\r\nstatesmen and editors are with us.

And if\r\ncertain reforms are consummated there will be a less number. And there\r\nare mighty few Socialists who are “dangerous.”\r\n\r\nIn this connection may be noted an incident that occurred during the\r\nCooper Union lecture course at New York City. It was claimed that the\r\naudiences, judged by their applause, were Socialistic. So a vote was\r\ntaken. In one audience of 1,200 people there were less than twenty\r\nSocialists. Then this question was put to the audience: “Those who\r\nbelieve the time has come for the community to assert a larger control\r\nover the public enterprises, such as the trusts, railroads and public\r\nutilities, please rise.” The entire audience arose.\r\n\r\nThere are no “dangerous classes” in such an audience—a typical,\r\nintelligent public gathering. “The people will wobble right.” The people\r\nare discovering the wrongs in government and they are finding that they\r\nthemselves are largely to blame for these wrongs. They find that they\r\nhave neglected their rights. They have conferred special privileges.\r\nThey have permitted aggressions. It is largely their own fault. They are\r\nbeginning to see that. They want to correct their mistakes. They will\r\ncorrect them.\r\n\r\nAnd those who cry “wolf” when the people are trying to get back their own\r\nare more dangerous than any others.—_The Buffalo Times._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Populist” is from the Latin word _populus_, meaning the people.\r\n“Populite,” which is used to a considerable extent in the South instead\r\nof Populist, is also from the Latin word populus.

The need for “seers” is greatest in a\r\ndemocracy where autocracy fails and the people must fall back upon broad\r\ninstincts, intuitive reasoning and average intelligence. The poet-seer\r\nis the highest type of the visionary. His message comes in the form of\r\nrhythmic speech which has the widest carrying capacity. Poets, however,\r\ndo not come into the world by accident. The poet comes only after\r\npreparation is made and reception is assured. For support he can depend\r\nno longer upon an indulgent king or upon patrons. Today the people stand\r\nin place of these. But as yet the collective mind has not worked out the\r\nproblem of protection in spiritual properties. This is one of the main\r\nproblems America has to meet: to create and sustain a race of poet-seers\r\nwhich will stand in right relation to the people and move in these broad\r\nlands as broad as they.—_Tomorrow._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMonett, the Ohio lawyer, began the prosecution of the Standard Oil trust\r\nwhen the Government was fostering the trusts and the courts knocked him\r\nout. Now the Government begins to make signs that it is against the\r\ntrusts and another case has been begun in Ohio. The courts will change\r\ntheir sides. Monett was downed by Rockefeller, beaten by the courts, and\r\nkicked out of the Republican Party.

It may be true that the delegation\r\nwas not those chosen by the men engaged in the original movement, but\r\nit is also true that even for appearance’ sake he had to go through the\r\nformality of receiving a delegation of workmen, and, at least to that\r\ndegree, the new departure has been recognized.\r\n\r\nIt is also of interest to know that, though the Russian workmen have\r\nhad no organization, yet their strike has been declared at an end by\r\nagreement, and that they are now engaged in the selection of their\r\nrepresentatives in a mixed commission to determine the following\r\nquestions: A shorter workday, an increase in wages, the right to\r\norganize, and assemblage and freedom of speech.\r\n\r\nJointly, the people insist that the government shall be based upon\r\njustice and the participation of the people therein, regardless of their\r\nstation in life, equality before the law, inviolability of domicile,\r\nthe freedom of association, of speech and of the press, and compulsory\r\neducation.\r\n\r\nThus, after all, out of the strikes of the Russian workmen, though many\r\nof their dear ones have been killed and mutilated, their blood has\r\nsanctified their cause and will make for the good, the progress and the\r\nuplifting of all the people of Russia.—_American Federationist._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA revolution is on, and the attacking party has inscribed the Populist\r\nprinciples upon its banners.

Never before\r\nhas the prospect seemed at all discouraging for Standard Oil raids, Beef\r\nTrust schemes and kindred despoliation of the land and the fulness and\r\nthe people thereof.

Great numbers of prisoners, and immense\r\nquantities of guns, ammunition, food and other supplies, fall into the\r\nhands of the victors.\r\n\r\n    Count Tolstoi writes to the London _Times_ denouncing this as\r\n    a “reckless, disgraceful, cruel war instigated by a score of\r\n    immoral individuals.”\r\n\r\nMarch 11.—General Kuropatkin reports that the remnants of his armies\r\nare retreating on Tieling. They are still harassed by Japanese attacks.\r\nThe Russians have lost considerably more than 100,000 men.

General Kuropatkin reports 50,000 wounded in the\r\npast few days. Marshal Oyama reports the country swept clear of Russians\r\nfor a distance of twenty-five miles north of Mukden.\r\n\r\nMarch 14.—The Russian War Council in session with the Czar votes to\r\ncontinue the war.\r\n\r\n    Despite a repulse south of Tie Pass, the Japanese continue a\r\n    rearguard attack on the retreating Russians.\r\n\r\nMarch 15.—A Japanese fleet of twenty-two warships going westward is\r\nsighted off Singapore, India.\r\n\r\nMarch 17.—The Czar curtly dismisses General Kuropatkin from his command,\r\nand promotes Lieutenant-General Linevitch, heretofore at the head of the\r\nfirst army, to be Commander-in-Chief of all the forces in Manchuria.\r\n\r\n    The Russian War Council decides to place a new army of 450,000\r\n    men in the field, and orders the Baltic squadron to proceed on\r\n    its way to the East.\r\n\r\n    The Russian army, having abandoned Tie Pass, continues its\r\n    flight northward, harassed by Japanese attacks from all sides.\r\n\r\nMarch 19.—The Russians are still retreating and Kai-Yuan and Fakoman are\r\noccupied by the Japanese.\r\n\r\nMarch 21.—General Kuropatkin returns to the front to accept a\r\nsubordinate command under General Linevitch.\r\n\r\nMarch 22.—All the Russian ministers but two are now said to favor peace.\r\n\r\nMarch 24.—The Russian troops halt for a short rest at a point\r\nseventy-four miles north of Tie Pass. The Japanese armies are believed to\r\nbe executing another flanking movement.\r\n\r\nMarch 25.—It is given out from St. Petersburg that the Russians have sent\r\n800,000 men to the front since the beginning of the war.\r\n\r\nMarch 28.—The Japanese again attack the rearguard of the retreating\r\nRussians. General Oku reports that the spring thaws make the movements of\r\nboth armies difficult.\r\n\r\n    It is no longer denied that the Russian Government is moving\r\n    for peace.\r\n\r\nMarch 29.—A court-martial is designated to try General Stoessel, it being\r\ncustomary in Russia to so try any officer that surrenders.\r\n\r\n    All Europe shows eagerness to invest in the new Japanese bonds.\r\n\r\nMarch 30.—Both Russia and Japan deny that they are making any efforts to\r\nbring about peace.\r\n\r\n    General Linevitch issues an address to his troops, closing with\r\n    the words, “May God help you in the coming battle.”\r\n\r\n    The Japanese continue their flanking movement and skirmishes\r\n    occur between them and the Russian outposts.\r\n\r\nMarch 31.—General Sakharoff, former Chief of Staff, quits the Russian\r\narmy because of a quarrel with General Linevitch.
