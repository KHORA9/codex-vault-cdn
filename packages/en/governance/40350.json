No less miraculous has been for many the tenacity of Chinese\r\nresistance to Japan's invasion ever since the first bullets whizzed\r\nthrough the night near the Marco Polo Bridge southwest of Peking early\r\nin July, 1937. The undeclared war has spread disaster through an area\r\nlarger than that immediately affected in Europe's battles from 1914 to\r\n1918; hundreds of thousands have died in action; for months China's\r\ncapital has been in the hands of the enemy. But China is not on her\r\nknees.\r\n\r\nThe explanation is simple. For the first time in her history, China\r\nfights as a nation. More is involved than can be attributed to\r\nGeneralissimo Chiang K'ai-shek's personal leadership or the strategic\r\nand organizational services rendered, until his recent recall to\r\nGermany, by Alexander von Falkenhausen, chief of staff of the Turkish\r\narmies during the World War. A people without allegiance to its\r\ngovernment and without faith in itself would have been incapable of\r\nbraving the ordeal of retreat, massacre, and occupation as successfully\r\nas have the Chinese. That China fights today as a nation is no small\r\ntribute to the National Government of the Kuomintang established at\r\nNanking in 1927. How long she will be able to fight as a nation is a\r\nquestion to be answered only by reference to the national mentality and\r\npolitical institutions which have emerged since the collapse of the\r\nManchu Empire in 1911-1912. It is the purpose of this volume to appraise\r\nthe record of China's republican era.\r\n\r\nThe author was compelled to beat his own path. Only a few books on\r\nmodern government in China are available in English, and these, written\r\nby Chinese, are modeled in their presentation on Western prototypes to\r\nan extent of obscuring, though unintentionally, the very substance of\r\nChinese politics. In Dr. Linebarger's pioneer venture the dynamics of\r\ninternal instability, typical of the earlier phases of the Republic, and\r\nthe gradual consolidation under the Nanking regime are analyzed with\r\nextraordinary penetration. Instead of being confronted with meaningless\r\nform and empty legality, the reader is placed in a position to view step\r\nby step the evolution of conflicting and merging forces: political\r\nmovements and their contest for the loyalty of the masses, the rough and\r\nready rule of military might, and the official hierarchies representing\r\norganized governments. Throughout this work, as in Dr. Linebarger's\r\nearlier _Political Doctrines of Sun Yat-sen_, the broad stream of\r\nConfucian thought fertilizing age after age of China's social existence\r\nand Sun's purposeful ideological adaptations combined in his _San Min\r\nChu I_ are shown in fundamental harmony. One distinction, however,\r\nstands out clearly. The Confucian tradition applied itself to a vaguely\r\nconceived but essentially unified world order. In the _San Min Chu\r\nI_ we encounter the elements of a national credo, self-assertive and\r\nmilitant.\r\n\r\nThe role of ideology in modern government has suffered curious neglect\r\namong students of politics for a considerable time. In periods of\r\nrelative ideational saturation or stagnation, the mechanics of\r\nconstitutional law or the give and take of legislative barter may\r\ndistract from the basic framework of values and objectives giving shape\r\nto the political order. The rise of totalitarian systems relying heavily\r\non ideological appeal and propaganda techniques has laid new stress upon\r\nthose factors which predetermine political behavior. In China's vast\r\nexperience we have the supreme example of ideological guidance so firmly\r\nestablished as to reduce to a minimum direct governmental intervention\r\nin the affairs of the individual. It is perhaps Sun Yat-sen's tragedy\r\nthat for years he placed his faith in the magic of democratic verbiage\r\nimported from the West; a new orientation came to prevail after 1923,\r\nwhen at Sun's instance tested practitioners of mass organization from\r\nthe Soviet Union began to overhaul and streamline the Kuomintang\r\napparatus.\r\n\r\nGovernment in China has become migratory as a result of Japan's advance.\r\nA mere description of its previous structure and functions would today\r\nhave little relevance. But Dr. Linebarger has probed deeply enough into\r\nthe foundations of Chinese political life to distinguish with uncommon\r\ndiscernment between the ephemeral and the durable. His long-range\r\nexposition transcends the exigencies of the hour and delineates the\r\nissues of China's future.\r\n\r\n                                                FRITZ MORSTEIN MARX.\r\n  ADAMS HOUSE,\r\n    HARVARD UNIVERSITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nI am deeply indebted to the five gentlemen who have read the entire\r\nmanuscript in some one of its stages. My father, Judge Paul Myron\r\nWentworth Linebarger, has given me tireless help in this as in all my\r\nprojects, for which I shall never be able to tender sufficient thanks.\r\nMy teacher, Professor Harley Farnsworth MacNair of the University of\r\nChicago, supplied numerous addenda and corrigenda of great value from\r\nhis knowledge of modern Chinese history. Professor Arthur N. Holcombe of\r\nHarvard University suggested changes which have made the work more\r\nrealistic. Assistance offered me by the Sinologue and philosopher,\r\nProfessor H. H. Dubs of Duke University, was of the utmost value.\r\nProfessor Paul H. Clyde, Duke University, provided many useful and\r\nsignificant hints, especially in the field of Sino-foreign relations.\r\n\r\nI am also under obligation to Mr. J. C. Yang, Library of Congress, and\r\nProfessor James R. Ware, Harvard University, for further suggestions; to\r\nProfessor Charles Sidney Gardner and Dr. John Fairbank, Harvard\r\nUniversity, and Professor George Kennedy, Yale University, for aid in\r\nthe general course of my Chinese studies; to Professor Maria Magdalena\r\nSchoch, until recently of the University of Hamburg, Germany, for a\r\ncritical reading of the revised manuscript; and to Miss Hazel Foster and\r\nMr. M.

Anthropologists have suggested that Sinanthropus Pekinensis, among\r\nthe earliest forms of man, resembles the modern Chinese more closely\r\nthan he does any other modern race. In what specific period the earliest\r\nancestors of the Chinese came to China is not known. It is certain,\r\nhowever, that about 1500 B. C. there existed a well-developed\r\ncivilized society in the Yellow River valley, and that this same society\r\nhas lived on--modified by the centuries, but in unbroken\r\ncontinuity--down into the present. China has outlasted Crete, Tyre,\r\nGreece, and Rome. The Aztec empire, which arose in Mexico when China was\r\nalready ancient, has become only a memory, while China is still vital.\r\nHow is it that China's institutions survive, while those of other\r\nnations did not? How real are Chinese institutions today? What,\r\nprecisely, is the Republic of China?\r\n\r\n\r\n_Duality or Confluence?_\r\n\r\nThe phrase _Republican China_ indicates an era rather than a system. The\r\npreceding ages of China have been known by the names of great dynasties.\r\nT'ang China (620-906 A. D.) overawed and instructed all eastern Asia.\r\nSung China (A. D. 960-1279) flourished, civilian and tolerant, in a\r\nworld marked by bigotry and arms. Well into the past century the West\r\nremained distant and vague. Republican China struggles in the presence\r\nof the modern world and subject to its superior force; her very name is\r\na capitulation to the twentieth century. The problems of the Republican\r\nera are not merely the problems of republican government; they involve\r\nthe broad question of the meeting and interpenetration of civilizations.\r\nHow are the Chinese, schooled for thousands of years in the effective\r\noperation of their own political system, to adapt themselves fast enough\r\nto the Western scheme? What happens when they must and yet cannot\r\neffectuate such adaptation? These are not queries to be answered simply\r\nin the routine terms of Western politics.\r\n\r\nFor the past three thousand years and more the eastern end of the\r\nEuropean-Asiatic land mass has formed a world to itself. Most of this\r\ntime it was larger, richer, and more civilized than the European world.\r\nDown to the nineteenth century of the Christian era the Chinese had no\r\nreason to suppose that theirs was not the most advanced and powerful of\r\ncivilized societies. They looked upon the Far East as the all-inclusive\r\nuniverse of civilization; to them, their way of life was the\r\ncommon-sense way. The Europeans did likewise, with reference to their\r\nown sphere. When the European realm expanded so as to include the whole\r\nplanet, when Western civilization began to dominate the earth, and the\r\nChristian family of nations became the world-wide international system,\r\nthe Chinese were forced to concede that the Far East could not be kept\r\nto itself. They have found it indispensable to respond, as individuals\r\nand as a people, to the new environment closing in on them. Doing so has\r\nnecessitated the reexamination and restatement of nearly all basic\r\nvalues of Chinese life.\r\n\r\nSince the nineteenth century the Chinese have been faced with the\r\nalternative of adhering to their own traditions or accepting those of\r\nthe West. Institutions and practices which are so well established that\r\nthey seem to rest on sheer common sense in each of the competing\r\ncivilizations have been placed in juxtaposition. As a result, the\r\nChinese now know two kinds of common sense to justify a course of\r\naction. The ensuing difficulty at times goes deeper; for they may be\r\nsaid to have even two kinds of sanity. In old China a man who wanted no\r\nsons seemed a patent lunatic; in the Western world he might be perfectly\r\nsane. A modern Chinese faces thousands of such choices.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Peculiarities of Old China_\r\n\r\nObviously, government in Republican China cannot be understood without\r\nanalysis of the foundations upon which it is built. Such an analysis\r\nrequires an inquiry, however cursory, into the peculiarities of old\r\nChina and those of contemporary China. Some of the difficulties of\r\nmodern China arise from the very adequacy of the old system. Had the\r\nChinese of the past been less satisfied with their society, they might\r\nhave become more accustomed to change and transience.\r\n\r\nChina from the first millennium B. C. occupied the central position in\r\nthe Far East. No other country in that part of the earth was so powerful\r\nor so civilized. India, despite important contributions to Chinese\r\nreligious thought, was too far away to impinge greatly upon the Chinese.\r\nJapan was heavily indebted to the Chinese, and encouraged the Chinese in\r\nviewing themselves as the most civilized of peoples. This had important\r\nconsequences. As China was unified most of the time, and as there was no\r\nother polity to compare with the Chinese, their political system took on\r\nthe appearance of a universal empire. The neighboring states paid formal\r\ntribute, and the Chinese were unprepared to meet another people who\r\nmight claim political equality as an organized state. Even today, in the\r\nattitudes of the Chinese and Japanese toward one another, there are\r\nstrong traces of this traditional point of view and indications that the\r\nJapanese would like to restore a closed Far Eastern order with\r\nthemselves in supremacy.\r\n\r\nSince old China was rarely confronted with international problems, the\r\nChinese were not aware of their realm as a nation-state. There was no\r\nsharp territorial limit to the Chinese polity, and no requirement that\r\nwithin certain boundaries one authority be defined as supreme. The\r\nChinese were able to make their adjustments in the interplay of social\r\nand political controls with less frequent resort to theory than the\r\nWesterners. Nor was the Chinese ruler ever so firmly entrenched as to\r\neliminate the chance of being overthrown or to preclude the existence of\r\nother--pluralistic--independent social controls. The power of government\r\nwas indeed limited. It maintained the peace of the Chinese world,\r\ndirected education, supported the social proprieties, and was ornamental\r\nrather than efficient for the greater part of its activities.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese lived primarily under the dominance of nonpolitical\r\nagencies. These were the family (comparable to the Western clan), the\r\nvillage and district, and the _hui_ (association, guild, society--in the\r\nnarrowest sense of the term). The family was intimately bound up with\r\nthe Chinese religious system, which stressed the continuity of each\r\nindividual in the flesh. A personal immortality was to be secured with\r\ngreatest certainty through the survival of one's own blood. The village\r\nwas the main economic unit, and the union of villages into districts\r\n(_hsien_) provided an administrative division of importance: below the\r\n_hsien_ level, common interests were fostered by community home rule;\r\nabove it, by the government. This meant that elders, clans in council,\r\nvillage bosses, and other nongovernmental agencies carried on police\r\nwork, all local public construction, and most of the activities which\r\nare regarded in the modern West as falling under the jurisdiction of the\r\nstate. The _hui_ was able to supplement the family and the village; in\r\nguild form, it provided the chief framework of commercial and industrial\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nIf the government was weak and limited, and social control ensured\r\nprimarily by nongovernmental agencies, how did the Chinese achieve so\r\ngreat a political stability? Why did their polity not break up into a\r\nwilderness of tiny social groups, each jealous and particularistic, like\r\nmedieval Europe? The answer is to be found in the psychological controls\r\nwhich the Chinese established. They devised a system of indoctrination\r\nunequaled by that of any other people.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese sought to guide men through the guidance of their ideas:\r\ngovernment by education, or government by propaganda. For this purpose\r\nscholarship and administration were closely allied. The government was\r\nmade up of scholars, who thereby occupied the position of greatest\r\nprestige in the society; the scholars were trained to serve as\r\ngovernment officials. Few officials were not scholars; few scholars\r\npursued a nonpolitical course. This led to a profound uniformity of\r\nthought, and was in accord with the dictates of the Confucian\r\ntradition.[1]\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest times Chinese thought was social and political in\r\nemphasis, rather than metaphysical and scientific. For thousands of\r\nyears scholars studied problems of society, government, and ethics. They\r\nappealed to tradition, and interpreted it. They organized the primitive\r\nreligion of the Chinese into a sophisticated social philosophy, and over\r\nthe centuries their work took effect. Chinese of different racial\r\nbackgrounds, using different spoken languages and unable to communicate\r\nwith one another by writing, living under different climatic and\r\neconomic conditions, came to show a startling uniformity of behavior.\r\nCustom and common sense were woven into a solid pattern by the scholars\r\nand accepted by the masses. Everything in human life bore some relation\r\nto everything else, and the life of man was related to the world of\r\nnature. There was no sharp distinction between natural science and\r\nsocial philosophy.\r\n\r\nThe educational integration of government, mores, and physical existence\r\ncreated a system of control which has exceeded all others in lasting\r\npower. The group in command was the scholastic bureaucracy, but\r\nmembership in it was not hereditary. Scholar-officials were recruited by\r\ncivil service examinations, and to this degree the society was a\r\ndemocratic one. Every child in the society had the theoretical\r\nopportunity of becoming prime minister. Furthermore, the power exercised\r\nby the scholar-officials was different in its nature from that of legal\r\nrulers in the West. Government was preventive rather than remedial.\r\nConstitutionality was not confined to legal matters; in a broader sense\r\nit extended to all subjects. The scholars were as much subject to\r\nestablished tradition as the humblest Chinese, and everyone knew the\r\ntradition. The scholars excelled only in knowing it more thoroughly.\r\n\r\nIt may be stated as a truism that under any government the actual scope\r\nof its intervention is confined to a certain category of affairs,\r\nbounded on the one hand by matters which are so trivial or so unexplored\r\nthat they are left to the citizen's free choice and on the other by\r\nsubjects in which there is such general agreement as to make political\r\naction unnecessary. This latter sphere might be called ideological\r\ncompliance--control of men brought about by the inculcation of broad\r\nuniform patterns of belief and behavior. If men are induced to agree\r\nupon a traditionally fixed mode of behavior, they will unite in\r\npersecuting dissenters and will not be conscious of the tyranny of\r\nideological doctrine. But if they think in many different ways, they\r\nwill be able to gain security only by promises of mutual\r\nnoninterference. Liberty--as absence of governmental restraint--may thus\r\nresult either from a complete concord, in which every man is free to do\r\nas he wishes since all men wish to do basically the same, or from a\r\nspecific guarantee of each individual's freedom to follow his own\r\ninterest or caprice within a defined limit. The old system of China was\r\na free society in so far as dissent calling for government interference\r\nwas relatively negligible, and at the same time a society rigidly\r\ncontrolled with respect to the uniformity of individual behavior.\r\n\r\nThis tradition was pragmatic and realistic. The Chinese ideological\r\ncontrols operated successfully because they corresponded reasonably well\r\nwith the actualities of social and economic existence. With the coming\r\nof the West, the old Chinese system was affected in two ways: First, the\r\namorphous Chinese society was threatened by the strong, effectively\r\norganized states of the West. Secondly, the competitive accomplishments\r\nof Western civilization destroyed, in large part, the assumption of\r\nuniversality upon which much Chinese tradition depended, and thereby\r\nimpaired the power of the scholar-officials. The twentieth century\r\nbrought China a new freedom, unaccustomed and unsought. The old system\r\nwas threatened with ruin, and modern China faced the problem:\r\nreplacement or reconstitution? Or, more dangerously: chaos or political\r\nextinction?\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Peculiarities of Modern China_\r\n\r\nThe lifetime of one man can span the gap between old China and new.\r\nThere are men living in Peking today who can remember when the Forbidden\r\nCity (the palace-city of the emperors) was sacred and inviolate, and\r\nwhen the mandarinate ruled in accordance with immemorial usage. These\r\nmay regard all Western science as a confusion, a wild torrent of exotic\r\nwords, which answers no problems, gives human life no aim and no\r\ndignity, and is bound to return to the alien dust whence it came.\r\nOpposing them are younger Chinese who hate the dead hand of the past and\r\nlook forward to a Westernized, scientific, industrial China which will\r\ndiffer from Europe and America only in being even more modern than they.\r\n\r\nMost Chinese fall into neither of these groups. Many of them, however,\r\nhave a definite conception of the West and of the benefits which Western\r\ncivilization has to bestow. They also realize the threat which it\r\ncontains for those who do not master it. Yet they have been nurtured in\r\nthe serene humanity of ancient custom and hold to it with the\r\neffortlessness of habit long transmitted. Out of this dual standard\r\nthere spring daily problems of ethics and conduct, of private life and\r\npublic policy. Administrative organization versus family loyalty and\r\nnepotism, promptness versus leisureliness, discipline versus courtesy:\r\nthese and many others are omnipresent antitheses.\r\n\r\nAnachronism is China's second self. There is no set scheme of things.\r\nModern Western civilization has not been adopted so fully as to make the\r\ntraditional habits seem outmoded, nor has the past survived to an extent\r\nas to make everything modern appear ridiculous. The notion of world\r\ngovernment, for example, is gone from China, and the notion of\r\nmulti-national government not yet clear. The relation of the individual\r\nto society and of the parts of society to the whole are not yet\r\nreformulated; this affects such matters as criminal law, political\r\norganization, and economic development. Virtually every adaptation in\r\nChina must be thought through from the beginning by the Chinese; and\r\neven in thinking there are varying styles. Are the Chinese to think\r\nafter the fashion of the West--scientifically and logically--or are they\r\nto think in their accustomed traditional and empirical manner?\r\n\r\nIt is thus patent that the new Chinese world which is appearing must\r\ngrow out of the background of the past and the necessities of the\r\npresent. It cannot readily be planned because there are not enough\r\nformulas common to the old Far Eastern and the new Western worlds. New\r\nChina must be a blending, from use, from habit, from new skills imposed\r\nupon old. Out of the dangers and misfortunes of the years since 1912 the\r\nChinese have developed a small body of political methods which is\r\ntemporarily workable. But the greater part of their social and\r\ngovernmental thought and custom has yet to go through the process of\r\nreevaluation by practice. Chinese political development has perforce to\r\nbe emergent and not planned.\r\n\r\nAccording to either time scheme, that of her long past or of the modern\r\nworld, modern China is anachronistic. The transformation of the Chinese\r\nworld of the past to the China of the future involves the creation of a\r\nwhole set of transitional institutions designed to lead from one to the\r\nother. Contemporary Chinese institutions are neither those of the past\r\nnor those of the future; they are a peculiar scheme of more recent\r\norigin and bound to be replaced. Old China is gone. Modern China is\r\nnovel and unstable; in time it too will yield to a China of which\r\nprophecy affords but few glimpses.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The World Significance of Chinese Government_\r\n\r\nIf government in Republican China is an extemporized and doomed system,\r\nrooted in no past, committed to no future, why should it be scrutinized\r\nat all? A number of reasons for examining Chinese government suggest\r\nthemselves. Some of these are of sufficient significance to merit\r\nstatement, so as to suggest facts and issues worthy of special notice.\r\nIf certain points of key importance are kept in mind, they may serve as\r\nreferences whereby the relative ranking of any specific topic may be\r\nascertained.\r\n\r\nFirst, the mere geographic extent of China is such as to make her\r\ngovernment necessary to a picture of contemporary governments. At least\r\nevery fifth human being now living is a Chinese.\r\n\r\nSecond, in international relations China has been of great passive\r\nimportance. The wars between Western and Far Eastern nations have all\r\nbeen fought over the so-called Chinese question. The partition of China\r\nand the open door in China have been issues of international concern.\r\nSince 1931 the Chinese have been active participants in the struggle for\r\nthe control of China, and the nature of their government determines in\r\nlarge part the effectiveness of their resistance. China is a vast\r\nmarket, and an even vaster reserve of man power--for troops or for\r\nindustrial labor.\r\n\r\nThird, the pathology of government deserves attention. Chronic social\r\ndisorder may provide a great variety of political facts wherewith to\r\ngauge the nature of political power. Well-governed societies do not\r\nsupply similar material because they rarely need to probe political\r\nfundamentals.\r\n\r\nFourth, old China offers a challenging demonstration of secular,\r\ncivilian, pacific world government. The Chinese commonwealth of the past\r\nwas supernational; it seemed to the Chinese like unified civilized\r\nhumanity. Among the conflicting currents of present world politics,\r\nthere are some which drift toward world unity; old China may present\r\nsignificant analogies to the international institutions of today.\r\n\r\nFifth, the universal features of government may be more fruitfully\r\nscrutinized in a novel cultural and social setting. China presents a\r\nbackground radically different from the Western one, and affords a\r\nunique test whereby Western political patterns and those of world-wide\r\nsignificance may be distinguished from one another.\r\n\r\nSixth, the question of method in political science may meet\r\nqualifications after being applied to Chinese political thought. The\r\nChinese did not seek that illusory precision which has been one of the\r\nchief goals of Western thought ever since logical procedure was\r\nestablished by the Greeks. The Western man in the street, however,\r\ndepends very little on mathematics or logic in his everyday thinking.\r\nIndirectly, the effect of inductive and deductive method has been\r\nrevolutionary, but their importance in routine operation or\r\nunspecialized thought is open to question--especially in view of the\r\nfindings of modern psychology. It may well be that Chinese thought can\r\nassist in the interpretation of everyday experience in the West,\r\nprecisely because it is not too specialized or scientific.\r\n\r\nSeventh, the Chinese may contribute in a practical way to political\r\nknowledge and leadership throughout the world. These contributions may\r\nbe anticipated by a consideration of past and present Chinese\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nEighth, the Chinese have lived in a peculiar historical environment,\r\nconsideration of which may broaden our outlook. Most Western \"world\r\nhistories\"--with few exceptions such as H. G. Wells's brilliant\r\n_Outline_--are histories of the West Asiatic and European worlds, with\r\nonly perfunctory references to China.\r\n\r\nThe relative novelty of Chinese materials to Western research explains\r\nin great part the neglect accorded them in the Western social sciences.\r\nWith the narrowing of the world by modern means of transport and\r\ncommunication the situation is changing. The science of Sinology\r\n(systematic study of China through Chinese texts) has won its place\r\namong the archaeological disciplines. Sinologists have made available to\r\nWesterners a great deal of material, but its value depends in large part\r\nupon the degree to which it is incorporated into the generally\r\naccessible and usable body of knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Main Factors in Modern Chinese Government_\r\n\r\nIn the consideration of modern Chinese government a somewhat novel\r\napproach to government is called for: one which distinguishes different\r\nelements and levels of control and makes plain their interrelation. The\r\nnarrow consideration of the formal structure would be puzzling and\r\ndiscouraging, since the various governments of modern China have been\r\nthe ornaments rather than the engines of political power. An attempt to\r\nexplain modern China in terms of constitutional legal development alone\r\nwould lead to exasperation or frustration; the ideological and\r\ninstitutional context which might convey meaning would be lost.\r\n\r\nHow can government be studied when politics are antecedent to\r\ngovernment? If the rulers make and unmake the form of government almost\r\nat will, where is the real source of their power? If armies can dissolve\r\novernight and be reassembled under different banners on the morrow,\r\nmilitary power may seem tenuous and dependent on other factors. What are\r\nthese? If property is insecure and the standards of wealth subject to\r\nvariation, how can economic power be treated as an ultimate determinant?\r\nHow do men wield authority of any sort, while they create or destroy the\r\nmachinery of authority?\r\n\r\nFor centuries China had been held together by a close-knit system\r\ndependent upon tradition. This tradition, the ideology called\r\n_Confucian_, was the device whereby the scholar-officials of the old\r\nimperial bureaucracy controlled society. Government itself was\r\nsubordinate to the moral and social leadership of the intellectuals, who\r\nrelegated the economic and military professions to the less honored\r\ncategories of society. The whole fabric of Chinese life was made up of\r\ninterlocking patterns; the West, by destroying a part, tore the whole\r\nasunder. Modern China faces more than political problems; a totalitarian\r\nrevolution has engulfed it. China has been proceeding not from partial\r\ncontrol to complete control, as are Italy,[2] Germany,[3] and the\r\nSoviets,[4] but from complete control to something not far from\r\nuniversal license--freedom all-pervading, unwanted, and terrifying. The\r\nproblem of modern Chinese government is the problem of re-creating\r\ngovernment out of its raw materials: land, people, doctrine, force, and\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nIn this problem certain factors stand forth as preeminent: ideological\r\nmovements, military and economic factors, governments.\r\n\r\nFirst, the movements. These supplant the ancient tradition and the old\r\nhierarchy of scholars. In the place of one settled authority over all\r\nsubjects, there suddenly appeared thousands of little authorities.\r\nAnarchism, dress reform, Christianity, feminism, nationalism,\r\npro-Japanism, communism, atheism, capitalism--discordant and partially\r\ncontradictory, these all compete for the authority or a part of the\r\nauthority once held by the old system. China undergoes intellectual,\r\nmoral, educational, political, economic, military, scientific, and\r\nindustrial revolutions all at once, and all for the same reason--the\r\npassing of the old unified order. Imagine the Renaissance, the\r\nReformation, the French Revolution, the industrial revolution, the Gold\r\nRush of '49, the World War, and the Russian Revolution all happening in\r\nthe same country in the same generation! This is a common-place\r\ncomparison, frequently made. Movements determined the loyalty of troops,\r\nthe title to property, the form of government. Power inhered in them,\r\nsince they determined the conditions under which men would seek and\r\nwield power. A great part of the control of China has been exerted\r\ndirectly, by means of the movements themselves.\r\n\r\nSecond, the armies took the power which goes with military force, simply\r\nbecause theirs was military force. They did not have to seek power. It\r\naccrued to them, out of the disorder of society. Along with military\r\npower went economic power as the most tangible and negotiable. Guns and\r\nproperty seem very realistic indices of power, as long as the troops are\r\nloyal and the property safe from confiscation or devaluation.\r\n\r\nThird, the governments. Between ideological movements, which sought to\r\nrebuild the ideas and habits of men, and armies wielding a brief but\r\nnearly unrestricted authority, government played its tertiary role. It\r\nwas at times of ludicrous unimportance, and on some occasions possessed\r\npower in its own right. It leaped to a sharply improved position after\r\n1928, but never possessed the generality of assent or the monopoly of\r\nforce to the degree common in the West.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Approach_\r\n\r\nGovernment may mean the control (or attempted control) of society by men\r\nprofessing to act in the name of all society. In this sense it includes\r\npropagandists and educators who seek to reconstitute society, leaders of\r\nmovements, soldiers, economic leaders of all classes, and government\r\nleaders (so far as they use government establishments as an actual means\r\nof control). Viewed thus, the political processes of modern China are\r\nmanifold and significant. Here is power stripped naked, power without\r\nornament, power resting squarely upon the brains or guns of men. Men\r\nrise and fall in the contest for power; they rise and fall absolutely,\r\nnot in a fictitious scheme which establishes a fictitious order of\r\nconstitutional offices sometimes providing asylum for popular leaders in\r\neclipse.\r\n\r\nGovernment may also mean the structure and function of that formally\r\norganized group in society which claims to act upon the mandate of legal\r\nsovereignty. When the concept of sovereignty itself is vague, confused,\r\nor absent, government by title may be merely one among several factors\r\nof power. Government in China is broader than the governments of China;\r\nthe two should be distinguished from one another.\r\n\r\nIn outlining government in Republican China, the present analysis\r\nfollows the broader construction of the word _government_. The\r\ngovernments proper are accordingly discussed in the last part, the first\r\ntwo being devoted to the ideological movements and to the military and\r\neconomic factors. For the purpose of defining the three sets of controls\r\nas clearly as possible, each is treated separately. This has\r\nnecessitated a corresponding arrangement of the historical data, though\r\nin each part presented from a different point of view. But it is highly\r\ndesirable that the long-range Chinese chronology be kept in mind. To\r\nthis end a table of Chinese dynasties has been provided.[5] As a result\r\nof separate analysis the movements, the armies, and the governments may\r\nappear in bolder relief than would otherwise be possible, and the role\r\nof government in the broadest sense may be made clearer, not only for\r\nChina but for the West as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] For a description of this system see below, pp. 18 ff.\r\n\r\n[2] _Cf._ H.

In emphasizing certain aspects of old China,\r\nit is impossible to trace the entire broad evolution.[1] In fact, the\r\nemergence of those devices which, along with government in the narrow\r\nsense, guided China in her long past dates back to prehistory.\r\nThroughout the ages, however, Chinese life has preserved its identity.\r\n\r\n  Chinese culture is unique in its continuity. Its most striking\r\n  characteristic is a capacity for change without disruption. It would\r\n  appear that that characteristic goes back even to [those] cultures\r\n  which preceded the Shang in northeast China. Shang culture, like all\r\n  great cultures, was eclectic, fertilized by influences from many\r\n  quarters. But these influences and techniques, when they were\r\n  accepted, met the same fate which has overtaken every people, every\r\n  religion, every philosophy which has invaded China. They were taken\r\n  up, developed to accord with Chinese conditions, and transmuted into\r\n  organic parts of a culture which remained fundamentally and\r\n  characteristically Chinese.[2]\r\n\r\nThis is the comment of H. G. Creel, an American Sinologue who has helped\r\nto explain the archaeological sites of a Chinese civilization\r\nconsiderably older than any other. Even in its historical beginnings the\r\ncivilization of man in China displayed features corresponding to that of\r\nthe modern Chinese.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Ages before Confucius_\r\n\r\nThe earliest Chinese state known is the Hsia, which is traditionally\r\ntermed a dynasty in the Chinese chronicles and given the dates 2205-1765\r\nB. C. More critical examination of the materials of Chinese tradition,\r\nthe excavation of the engraved bones and bronzes from succeeding\r\nperiods, and an interpretation of Chinese history with the technique of\r\nmodern archaeology have upset the credibility of the records of the\r\nearliest periods. All that is established is the fact that the Hsia was\r\na state before the Shang. It is unlikely that Hsia exercised any\r\nimperial hegemony over other peoples, since the empire system did not\r\nrise till Chou times.\r\n\r\nOf the Shang dynasty (traditionally 1765-1123 B. C.) much more is\r\nknown. Thirty years ago most Western scholars thought the Shang\r\nchronicles to be myth, but excavations in northeast China have located a\r\nShang capital and have unearthed a large body of inscriptions on\r\nbone.[3] The Shang culture must have been highly developed, possessing\r\nan urban life, writing, and a definite system of monarchical government.\r\nThe germs of scholastic leadership were present. Power was in the hands\r\nof a single ruler (_wang_, or king), who claimed hegemony for an\r\nundetermined distance beyond the walls of the capital.\r\n\r\nIn the twelfth century B. C. the Shang dynasty was overthrown by\r\nconquerors from the west, the Chou. The Chou dynasty bridges the gap\r\nbetween the semihistoric and the definitely historic period of Chinese\r\nantiquity. Under the Chou the chief features of Chinese social and\r\nintellectual existence took on clear form. From the Chou conquest and\r\ntheir attempts to establish stable government China derived striking\r\nsocial and political characteristics. One of the astonishing facts about\r\nearly Chinese history is the manner in which the Chou rulers utilized\r\npropaganda to make their conquest secure, and in which their propaganda\r\nfurnished dynamic concepts of Chinese social thought and development.\r\n\r\nThe most important of these widely propagandized concepts was that of\r\nthe Chinese Empire. The city of Shang had been the center of a dominion\r\nwhich could not possibly have included more than a fraction of what is\r\nknown today as China. The civilized areas along the Yellow River were\r\nprobably no larger than Palestine. Most of what is now China was\r\nconquered in succeeding centuries. Even in this small area, it is not\r\nknown what relationship existed between the ruler of Shang and other\r\nrulers. The Chou monarchs built up the legend that the Shang rulers had\r\noccupied a position of primacy among the rulers of the civilized world,\r\nand then claimed the position themselves by right of succession through\r\nconquest. There was thus fostered the notion of one ruler, central and\r\nsupreme.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the Chou themselves taught the doctrine of the right of\r\nrevolution. They identified their god with the Shang god instead of\r\ndeclaring that their god had overwhelmed the other. They asserted that\r\nthis one god had been displeased by the profligacy and wickedness of the\r\nShang and had called upon the Chou to overthrow the Shang rulers. Both\r\nthese theories, refined and amplified, became fundamentals of Chinese\r\npolitical thought in later ages.[4]\r\n\r\nThe Chou established a system of government which left an imprint on\r\nChinese politics for three thousand years. In relating their\r\nmetropolitan administration to their occupation of the lands of North\r\nand Central China they were less successful. Lacking any other device of\r\ngovernment, they turned to feudalism, and on the quasi-feudal\r\nfoundations of the Shang they imposed a fief system. This led first to\r\nthe division of China into many small feudal units and later to the\r\nappearance of powerful territorial states. The first of these\r\nperiods--that in which feudalism predominated--was known as the Ch'un\r\nCh'iu, or Spring and Autumn epoch (770-473 B. C.). The second--in\r\nwhich the states developed--was known as the Chan Kuo, or Warring States\r\nepoch (473-221 B. C.).\r\n\r\nThe rise of the Chou provided China with her first government on an\r\nimperial scale and with the beginnings of a theory concerning the nature\r\nof imperial government. The increasing disorganization during the Ch'un\r\nCh'iu and Chan Kuo periods led to the development of the Confucian and\r\nother philosophies, wherein the Chinese, conscious of political\r\nshortcomings, sought the good society.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Ideology Called Confucian_\r\n\r\n551 B. C. is most commonly given as the year of Confucius' birth.\r\nConfucius (K'ung Ch'iu; also Master K'ung--K'ung Fu-tz[)u], from which\r\nConfucius is derived) was a wandering scholar and would-be official\r\nwhose life was spent in the advocacy of political and social reform. He\r\nwas important because of his part in establishing the profession of\r\nteaching and for his doctrines upholding good government. Discontented\r\nwith the present, he turned to the past--becoming conservative and\r\naristocratic in outlook. His position in the history of political\r\nthought he owes to the bent which he gave aristocratic conservatism. He\r\nsought the leadership of the _chün-tz[)u]_ (the upright, superior, or\r\naristocratic man) rather than the domination of laws. He developed an\r\nethical system secular and practical in its orientation and humane in\r\nits tenets. He emphasized the necessity of the individual's appropriate\r\nself-consciousness in the society, and the need for following _li_\r\n(propriety), the established values. He stressed family loyalty above\r\nall others, and insisted on respect for tradition. After his death in\r\n479 B. C. his ideas were elaborated, clarified, and revised into what\r\nis known as the _Confucian system_.[5]\r\n\r\nThis system underwent many changes. The Confucian influences came to\r\nprevail in the Han dynasty, in the second and first centuries B. C.,\r\nbut lost its official preeminence with the fall of the Han in the third\r\ncentury. It nevertheless retained a great share of intellectual\r\nleadership. In the Sung period (960-1279) the philosopher Chu Hsi\r\ndeveloped Confucianism into its most recent accepted form. Others joined\r\nhim in sharpening and refining Confucianism.\r\n\r\nThe Sung philosophers evolved a Confucianism which showed the influence\r\nof the Taoist and Buddhist philosophies. They reinterpreted the classics\r\nby emphasizing works other than those hitherto regarded as preeminent.\r\nWith reference to the concept _li_, they developed the notion of a truly\r\ncomplete order running through both spirit and matter. Metaphysics,\r\nalien to the mind of Confucius himself, became an operative part of\r\nConfucian thought. Through their ethical and psychological studies the\r\nSung Confucians translated the Confucian rationale into an effective\r\nideological technique for domination. It is not inconsistent to find\r\nthem opposing any action definitely governmental. Furthermore, they\r\nshowed themselves to be conservatives in politics, and through their\r\ncommentaries on the classics--which were studied in succeeding centuries\r\nalong with the texts themselves--imprinted their conservatism upon the\r\nChinese mind.\r\n\r\nThe ideology called _Confucian_ is not identical with Confucianism as\r\nthe philosophic system proper. In the first place, it is not known how\r\nmuch of the social doctrines taught by Confucius and his successors was\r\noriginal and how much mere transmission of preexisting beliefs.\r\nConfucius himself regarded his work as that of a transmitter and not a\r\ncreator. Secondly, the whole Chinese culture contributed elements of\r\nstrength to the ideology to which the name of Confucius became attached\r\nby Westerners. Thirdly, the system developed in practice to an extent\r\nwhich Confucius could not have anticipated. The Confucian ideology and\r\nsociety bear the relation to Confucius which Christendom bears to Jesus\r\nChrist; both founders would scarcely recognize the derivations to which\r\ntheir teachings have led.\r\n\r\nThe Confucian ideology came to prevail in China just before the day of\r\nChrist. At the time of Christ, Wang Mang, a usurper and a zealous\r\nConfucian, shook the Han Empire with his experiments. A period of\r\nreaction against Confucianism set in. Taoism and Buddhism provided rival\r\ncults. After the twelfth century, Confucianism rose slowly to power over\r\nmen's minds again--although it had never been wholly superseded by other\r\ndoctrines, it had long lacked its all-compelling primacy. Not until the\r\nMing dynasty (1368-1643) did it become the state philosophy of China,\r\nthe ideology whereby China lived politically and whereby she was\r\ngoverned.\r\n\r\nDescriptions of Confucian China apply, therefore, with particular\r\ncogency to the past five hundred years, if account is taken of the role\r\nof Confucianism as a state philosophy. But if those elements of Chinese\r\nculture which are subsumed under the name of Confucianism are considered\r\napart from Confucian philosophy, the time may be extended indefinitely.\r\nConfucian doctrine is one aspect of Chinese culture which has in various\r\ncenturies risen to the forefront. Underneath this doctrine there are\r\ntenets, near the level of unconscious habit, which apply to almost all\r\nages of China. It is difficult to separate the two phenomena and to\r\ndistinguish between Chinese culture and its most representative\r\nphilosophy. An analogy, remote but suggestive, is the influence of\r\nAristotle in the West. Periods of Aristotelian predominance can be\r\ndistinguished from the general history of Western thought, in which\r\nAristotle plays a consistent but lesser role. As Aristotle was\r\ninterpreted by Aquinas, so was Confucianism by the Sung philosophers.\r\nAristotelian politics are far removed from the specific problems of\r\nrepresentative or modern authoritarian government; nevertheless they\r\npossess great value and exercise an indeterminable influence upon the\r\nentire West. The analogy holds for China if left in its loosest terms.\r\nConfucianism is far from oblivion. The China which met the Western\r\nimpact--\"old China\" in the eyes of the twentieth century--was in fact\r\nmore Confucian than was the West Aristotelian. She was permeated by an\r\nideology in which Confucius' teachings were the key pattern, though not\r\none which he had made up in its entirety.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Government in the Confucian Ideology_\r\n\r\nIn Confucian China, government was reduced to a minimum. There existed a\r\nset of institutions which in many respects afforded a remarkable\r\nalthough misleading parallel to the governments of the West. In fact,\r\nthe earliest Western visitors to China found no difficulty in applying\r\ntheir own political language to China. The supreme Chinese leader they\r\ncalled the _emperor_, despite the inevitable Caesarian connotations of\r\nthe term and the fact that it erased the peculiar significance of the\r\nChinese title. Subordinate areas were called _provinces_. All the way\r\nthrough, the use of European concepts compelled whole series of\r\nunwarranted parallels. The term _mandarin_ forced its way into Western\r\ntongues, however, since there was no existing term to describe the\r\nmembers of the curious hierarchy of scholar-bureaucrats occupying a\r\nposition of hegemony among the institutions of Chinese society.\r\nUnfortunately for Chinese as well as Westerners, both were so poorly\r\ninformed in the beginnings of intercourse that the Chinese could not\r\nsecure an adequate picture of Europe, while the Europeans assumed that\r\nthe Chinese were more, rather than less, like themselves. The Chinese\r\nsociety, with a single supreme ritual leader, was termed an _empire_,\r\nand the predominant hierarchy of that society a _government_.\r\n\r\nActually, modern political scientists would have to hesitate before\r\napplying the term _government_ to the hierarchy of old China. In many\r\nrespects that hierarchy was more like Europe's medieval universities and\r\nour fraternal societies than the governments of the West. The prestige\r\naccruing to positions in the system was not derived so much from\r\npolitical power as from the status which the system offered to its\r\nmembers. An official, although he might value his power, was regarded in\r\nthe society at large almost as much for what he was as for the dignity\r\nwith which the office invested him. This arose from his peculiar role,\r\nin which his function was to provide a model of propriety in his private\r\nand public life rather than to interfere in the lives of others.\r\nInterference, to be sure, occurred--sharply, Draconically, directed more\r\nagainst the social group of the offender than against the offender\r\nhimself, on the theory that it was the function of the group to keep its\r\nmembers in line with the common-sense traditions. In such rare cases the\r\nofficialdom became a government--government as the institution of men\r\nwho seek to control society in the name of all society. Normally the\r\nofficialdom was not a government in this sense, as it claimed leadership\r\nrather than control, preached rather than punished, shamed rather than\r\nintimidated the people.\r\n\r\nConfucius said, \"If the people be led by laws, and uniformity sought to\r\nbe given them by punishments, they will try to avoid the punishment, but\r\nhave no sense of shame. If they be led by virtue, and uniformity sought\r\nto be given them by the rules of propriety, they will have the sense of\r\nshame, and moreover will become good.\"[6] In a governmental system which\r\nwas avowedly Confucian, the officials were discouraged from trying to\r\nformulate rules, for such rules, if specific, could only duplicate the\r\nenactments of custom and, if general, might entangle the official in a\r\nweb of words. If the officials were personally and individually\r\nworthless, there would be no hope for good government and the only\r\nremedy would consist in selecting good officials and placing them in\r\nhigh positions. If the officials were good, their integrity and common\r\nsense would show them the solutions to problems and they would have no\r\nneed to solicit advice from some manual of commands. No lifeless paper\r\nand ink could guide a people unless there were upright officials to\r\nstudy the classics and put the judicious rules found in them into\r\neffect. The only safeguard against bad government was good government by\r\ngood men; the only remedy for bad government was the effort of good men.\r\nThe Chinese never set up an imaginary machinery and turned themselves\r\ninto its cogs. To the simple, common-sense humanity of the Confucians, a\r\ngovernment made up of rigid laws--a system having no reference to the\r\npersonality or value of individuals, but embedded in a vast mechanism of\r\nnumbers--would have seemed anathema and lunacy.\r\n\r\nGovernment in China was an auxiliary activity, the reserve power of a\r\nhierarchy given to the pursuit of different ends. The officials were\r\nteachers first and magistrates afterward; the emperor was a supreme\r\nmodel first and a ruler afterward; the people were shamed, and punished\r\nonly when they were shameless. Such was the ideal theory upon which the\r\nChinese built their world society. The facts were rarely as bright as\r\nthey might have hoped; the reserve power never disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe necessity for government did not always proceed from the frailties\r\nof the governed. The Confucian system, although worthy of its great\r\nesteem, was marked by the difficulties which attend all human\r\norganization. Corruption and tyranny appeared, and were not by any means\r\nnegligible. In many cases it may be supposed that a system of laws would\r\nhave provided redress for individuals treated arbitrarily or unjustly;\r\nbut, if one is to judge by experience in the West, even law brings with\r\nit other types of injustice peculiar to itself. In China some of the\r\nmost benevolent and effective emperors advocated at times a government\r\nof rules and not of men, in order to check the caprice and the\r\noppression of officials; yet the role of law in China, in contrast to\r\nthe part it has played in the West, remained slight. The West affords\r\ninstances of effective political work outside legal systems, while the\r\nChinese have produced law codes of considerable breadth and\r\nsignificance. Nevertheless, the power of Chinese government aside from\r\nlaw is just as clear as the Western development of government within\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nThe old Chinese system was based upon control through ideas, control\r\nexercised through the maintenance of clear notions of right and wrong,\r\nas founded in certain well-established common-sense traditions. The\r\nworld of fact and the world of right and wrong were bound together, and\r\nthe whole ideology was one of general and all-pervasive order. While the\r\nWestern impact was felt cumulatively through the nineteenth century, the\r\nChinese world of fact went down into the limbo of myth in a few\r\ndisestablished generations, and with it went the compulsion which\r\nConfucian common sense had exerted.[7] The consequent development of new\r\nways of acting, which had nothing to do with traditional control, upset\r\nthe entire scheme. When the system of ideological guidance began\r\nbreaking down, there was a stampede to get away from it. Men no longer\r\ntrusted it, no longer trusted the tameness of their neighbors. A new\r\nwildness, a savagery armed with science, had come with the aliens from\r\nbeyond the seas. It was the old hierarchy to which men turned, calling\r\nit _the state_.\r\n\r\nAs a state, as an all-embracing control institution, the old Chinese\r\nhierarchy was a pseudomorph--it looked like a state but was not really\r\none. Now it had to develop those characteristics of regularity,\r\nimpersonality, and machine effectiveness demanded of a state in the\r\nmodern world. It had to restore the virtue of men by telling them how it\r\nwas possible to be virtuous in a world in which all things turned and\r\nchanged with the days and not with the centuries. It had to gather\r\ntogether the members of the old Chinese world-community, reorient them\r\nwith respect to the new, divided world around them, and fight off the\r\ninroads of outsiders. Above everything else, it had to grow strong, so\r\nthat it might institute order, so that it might someday grow weak again.\r\nOn the other hand, if a governmental system were set up which tried to\r\nmaintain the precarious supremacy that Western states have enjoyed, and\r\nwhich was subject to uncontrolled fluctuations in the thought of the\r\npeople upon whom it rested, the Chinese might lose their character as\r\nChinese. They might be absorbed into the Western world and become a\r\ngroup of yellow-skinned traditionless men, living according to the\r\nheritage of white men's laws and doomed to a perpetual inferiority\r\nbecause these laws were not their own. They might be aliens upon the\r\nearth, with no group to call their own. Such a nightmarish vision may\r\nhave come to Sun Yat-sen when he pleaded with all his heart for the\r\nunification and defense of a China still Chinese.\r\n\r\nThe old system broke and collapsed in 1911-1912. This collapse was\r\nhastened by the fact that the imperial family was incapable of\r\nleadership. A succession of degenerates and children occupied the\r\nthrone--the one intelligent emperor was imprisoned by a clique--and a\r\nfanatical old woman held enough power to keep anyone else from using it,\r\nbut not enough to lead or to want to lead a revolution from above. When\r\nthe old structure caved in, over four hundred million people were\r\nwithout effective government, and no one really knew how to create it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Replacement of the Confucian Ideology_\r\n\r\nOnly some of the movements which have occurred in China have had\r\npolitical significance. With the collapse of the old stable order, the\r\nChinese fell into great confusion, devoting themselves to a variety of\r\ndoctrines and crusades. Some of these movements may be regarded as\r\nsubordinate to the day-to-day struggle for military or governmental\r\npower; others, though within the sphere of politics as far as their\r\ninterests were concerned, never acquired sufficient importance to\r\nimpress themselves upon the general political scene.\r\n\r\nThe only movements which need be here considered are constituent ones.\r\nIt has been noted that the real basis for the stability and operation of\r\nthe old Chinese society lay not in the power of an organized body of\r\nlaw-makers, law-enforcers, and law-interpreters but in the\r\nconstitutionalism of common sense, in the deep harmony of agreement\r\nwhich the Confucian outlook on fact and value had created. Men were\r\nraised tame, and what tamed them was an ideology--a unified, coherent\r\nbody of ideas--which related the knowledge of the world to the sphere of\r\nmorals, which was applied by the intellectually dominant classes as a\r\nmeans of control, and which secured for the controlling classes hegemony\r\nover all groups in society.\r\n\r\nThe moment the old order weakened, it was inevitable that men would try\r\nto find substitutes which met four criteria: (1) a plausibly\r\nsatisfactory explanation for the world of fact; (2) a persuasively\r\nrelated scheme of values (right, wrong; good, bad); (3) use of this\r\nexplanation and the value scheme (both together forming an ideology) to\r\ncontrol behavior; (4) authoritative status of the individuals promoting\r\nthe ideology, whether or not organized as a group.\r\n\r\nIt will be recognized that these criteria fit the great religious\r\nmovements of mankind; it is equally apparent that they lend themselves\r\nto the promotion of governance. Governing under conditions of\r\nideological anarchy is at best a precarious effort--a makeshift, a\r\npitiable building upon sand. The Western world faces today the same\r\nproblem that the Chinese face: How are men to agree widely enough to\r\nlive together in peace? But the Chinese approached this problem from an\r\nexperience of deliberately fostered agreement. Confucianism had the\r\neffectiveness of the great religions and a sophistication and\r\nmalleability superior, perhaps, to any of them. As a consequence, the\r\nmodern Chinese were keenly aware of the necessity of the last two\r\ncriteria. The problem of ideological guidance is only half solved with\r\nthe presentation of a new scheme of facts and a new scheme of morals;\r\npropaganda and institutionalization remain.\r\n\r\nComplaints are current in the West to the effect that art, science, and\r\nletters are becoming propaganda--that is, that they are being used to\r\ncontrol men, or as attempts to control men. The Chinese of 1912 and\r\nafter never had similar scruples. All human effort was propaganda, and\r\nwhatever was not, was of only passing interest. There was no alternative\r\nwhile the Chinese tried to found a new common sense in the discredited\r\nruins of their old world order. Their natural science had been impeached\r\nby the demonstrable superiority of Western science. Their code of\r\nethics, whatever its aesthetic appeal, was ineffectual as a way of\r\nconduct among people who had different, more violent notions of right\r\nand wrong. Even the code of personal behavior--the elaborate courtesies,\r\nthe leisureliness, the grace of life in old China--was worthless in an\r\nenvironment which put a high premium upon speed, impersonality,\r\nefficiency. As the Chinese turned to a revision of all aspects of their\r\nmode of life at once, different groups, trying to find some one key\r\nreform which would solve all difficulties, fell into discord. Economic\r\nadvance, political reorganization, \"realism\" in outlook, educational\r\nreform--all these had their adherents. None was allowed, by either\r\nadherents or opponents, to stand simply as a group of separate reform\r\nmeasures to be considered on their own merits; the drive for a new\r\nideology made all proposals important for their bent rather than their\r\ncontent. A simple thing like the desirability of using Latin letters in\r\nmass education immediately took on a vast significance when related to\r\nthe _Kulturpolitik_ of the time. The left-wingers once attacked the\r\nmissionaries who had first tried to introduce it, on the ground that the\r\nmissionaries were seeking to prostitute the Chinese mind and to make the\r\nChinese betray the past. Later the Communists enthusiastically pushed\r\nthe same scheme, stating that the Chinese ideographs were a stronghold\r\nof reactionary thought. The torments of the struggle inevitably caused\r\nthe terms of conflict to resolve; gradually several more or less\r\ndeterminant movements emerged, around which all other reforms tended to\r\ncluster, because of sympathy or logical relationship.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Chief Movements in the Rebuilding of China_\r\n\r\nAmong the movements, Confucianism stands first. Even with its limpness\r\nand decadence, it still represents the greatest single intellectual\r\nforce in the country. To the Chinese, this force may not even be\r\napparent, and they take it as much for granted as the air they breathe.\r\nNevertheless, the outside observer can see that even though Confucianism\r\nis inert as a movement, its inertia is more important than the pressures\r\nof other causes. Unconsciously, the Chinese accept whole tracts of\r\nConfucian thought. They accept, in other words, the guidance of\r\nConfucian ideology in much the same way that Americans who are not\r\nchurchgoers still accept the major premises of Christianity, simply\r\nbecause their whole environment is charged with it. Just as in the West\r\na universal and potent Christian revival in politics is not likely but\r\nis nevertheless conceivable, so in China it is not very probable but\r\nquite possible that there will be a successful resurrection of the\r\northodox Confucian philosophy. Whether a strict Confucianism could\r\nreturn without monarchy is doubtful; and Sun Yat-sen's blend of\r\nrepublicanism and Confucianism is so well established that it may\r\nprevent the successful promotion of uninterpreted Confucianism.\r\n\r\nThe Taoists and Buddhists are similarly inactive in politics. More\r\nstrictly concerned with the supernatural than is Confucianism, they\r\nrepresent significant tangential forces upon the flow of political\r\ndevelopment, but do not express themselves in overt intervention. Among\r\nthe leaders of all groups except the Communists there are important\r\nmembers of both sects. It is not uncommon for any of them, defeated in\r\nwar or temporarily eliminated from politics, to turn to a monastery and\r\nstudy ancient texts, much in the way that an idle American politician\r\ngoes to a farm, cultivating his health and his reputation.\r\n\r\nIslam is a minor but living force in China. It has long prevailed in the\r\nborder territories of the Northwest, and for generations has presented\r\nvital and effective opposition to the Chinese influence. The territory\r\nof the Mohammedans was consequently a hotbed of rebellion and\r\nseparatism, until the ghastly religious wars of the past century drowned\r\nautonomous tendencies in an ocean of blood. At the present time the\r\nIslamic movement faces another equal to itself in ferocity and\r\npersuasiveness--Marxism--in Outer Mongolia, across the border in the U.\r\nS. S. R., and in the northwest controlled by the Chinese Red Army. Thus\r\nfar Islam has given no promise of power.\r\n\r\nNationalism--the movement launched by Sun Yat-sen, which follows his\r\ndoctrines of the _San Min Chu I_[8]--is the official movement of the\r\nNational Government of China and of the Nationalist armies under Chiang\r\nK'ai-shek. It is consequently the chief power of positive action in the\r\nwhole country. At various times, Sun's followers have been known as\r\nProgressives, Revolutionists, Republicans, and Nationalists--according\r\nto the phase of their program then uppermost.\r\n\r\nOpportunism, rationalized by one or another ornamental philosophy, has\r\nbeen very common in modern China. It has accepted ideological materials\r\nthe way they are used in superficial struggles of the West--making\r\nideals fit the facts and using them for the sake of the facts.\r\nOpportunism has been characterized by the avid acceptance of wholly\r\nimplausible doctrines, or by a disingenuous \"realism.\" Proalien and\r\ndefeatist movements have been opportunist in practical matters; \"strong\r\nman\" philosophies have served the causes of individual ambitions.\r\nIdeologically these currents were noteworthy only because they stirred\r\nup the mud, making genuine intellectual clarification all the more\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\nFinally, three important movements have come from outside. These are\r\nChristianity, Marxism, and pro-Japanism.\r\n\r\nEach sociopolitical movement in China has had economic connections. Some\r\nmovements are avowedly bourgeois and capitalist and find their roots in\r\nWestern tradition. Others are inspired by the challenge of the land\r\nproblem, which is very acute. World production has upset Chinese farm\r\nprices; international trade has ruined many peasant craft industries;\r\nmodern armies have imposed unprecedented tax burdens; opium and erosion\r\nruin large portions of the people and the land. In some cases the chaos\r\nin the countryside can only be stilled by massacre. Despite the presence\r\nof capitalist, proletarian, and agrarian economic movements, it seems\r\nlikely that economic questions will be settled by groups which do not\r\nconcentrate upon them to the exclusion of all others. Meanwhile, each of\r\nthe movements seeking to create a new China will have to provide for\r\nreform or replacement of the economic system, which is decrepit because\r\nof its internal decline and the appearance of economic devices from the\r\nWest vastly more effective, but inconsistent with Chinese modes of\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Confucianism in the Republic_\r\n\r\nConfucianism as an official movement has been used to support other\r\ntendencies, to further the opportunist activities of particular cliques,\r\nand to bolster--by disguising--the Japanese occupation of Manchuria. It\r\nis incorrect, however, to limit the role of Confucianism in modern China\r\nto these facts. In serving as a foundation for other movements it\r\npossesses unmeasured potentialities.\r\n\r\nConfucianism supposes that the truth and the socially desirable are\r\nidentical; that both are identical with the Confucian tradition; and\r\nthat an elite of scholars is required to propagate truth, clothing it\r\nwith the language of tradition and morality. Confucianism is hostile to\r\nthe very notion of sovereignty, leaves no room for a system of\r\npermanently separate nations, and is unable to accommodate the Western\r\nidea of an accidental growth in knowledge, dependent upon sporadic\r\nindividual initiative. Confucianism is strong in so far as it promotes a\r\nsociety based upon knowledge, in which individuals can ascend or descend\r\naccording to their personal virtue and competence. Such an ideal has a\r\ndefinite end in the physical universe by working toward a human\r\nimmortality of the flesh and the spirit--flesh through the perpetuation\r\nof the family name in the male line, spirit through the transmission of\r\nrecords and knowledge. Its present-day defects are obvious. The world of\r\nfact in the Confucian ideology does not correspond with the beliefs\r\naccepted as fact by the dominant West. The intellectual insulation\r\nagainst the outside necessary to ideological control could not be\r\nachieved by any single modern nation without the use of tyranny.\r\nMoreover, Confucian ethics and politics, more than twenty-four centuries\r\nold, can scarcely be expected to conform to the changed minutiae of\r\nhuman life, dominated by technology. Nevertheless, while the Chinese may\r\nnot turn again to the classics for guidance in concrete situations, or\r\nconsult ancient authorities for solutions to simple practical problems,\r\nthe moral and social doctrines of Confucianism, redefined or modified,\r\ncould well play a definite role in the modern world. In China the chief\r\nrivals to Confucianism will be the new heterodox schools of\r\nreinterpreted Confucianism--such as the versions posed by Sun Yat-sen\r\nand Chiang K'ai-shek, or the watery Confucianism of Manchoukuo.\r\n\r\nThe nonformal unorganized power of Confucianism weighs more heavily. If\r\nConfucianism were to be considered alone on the strength of the\r\nmovements featuring the password \"Back to Confucius!\" it would be so\r\nnegligible as to merit no attention. Not the strength of its partisans\r\nbut the concessions of its opponents and rivals make Confucianism\r\nimportant. Confucius can no more be eradicated from modern China than\r\nPlato, Aristotle, and Christ from the background of Western society.\r\nEvery Chinese movement, starting with Confucianism as the status quo,\r\nwill have to incorporate a large part of the traditional doctrines. It\r\nmay well be that in the new breeds of thought the Confucian strain will\r\nprove dominant and most lasting.\r\n\r\nUntil the breakdown of the Empire, Confucian texts were studied\r\nappreciatively rather than critically. One does not criticize common\r\nsense unless one is anxious for the reputation of a crank. With the\r\nblinding dawn of Western knowledge, Confucianism went into the\r\nwastebasket. Two years in New York were worth a generation of study over\r\nthe ancient authorities. From time to time, under the Republic, the\r\nvarious governments discussed plans for educational reform, or\r\nhaphazardly encouraged the dying traditionalist schools; but nothing\r\ncould restore the prestige of classicism. Strangely, the greatest\r\nimpetus toward classical learning was provided by the challengers of the\r\nclassics. Modern Chinese scholarship, using Western methods of critical\r\nstudy, and armed with new specializations undreamed of by the archaists,\r\nfound that the traditional authorities were valuable not only for what\r\nthey pretended to be--plain, direct, factual records--but also as source\r\nmaterial for penetrating interpretations.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese have turned to this task since the opening of the various\r\nscientific agencies of the National Government at Nanking and have\r\nalready produced works of importance on their own past. They have pushed\r\nback their scientifically ascertainable history almost a thousand years.\r\nThe modern Chinese students, who hated the classics when they were\r\nmouthed by sedate old scholars ignorant of the modern world, now devote\r\nthemselves to the classics to criticize them; criticizing them, they\r\nstudy them; studying them, they love them. The \"science of the country\"\r\n(Sinology) has recently been added to the curriculum of the modern\r\nschools; it is causing a veritable renaissance. In fact, the Chinese are\r\nconstantly becoming more anxious to find precedent for political growth\r\nand development in their own past rather than in the past of the West,\r\nwhich they could never appreciate as much as do Westerners.\r\n\r\nThe actual Confucian movements do not warrant attention. Militarists\r\nhave sponsored little Confucian coteries, or have paid for the\r\npublication of sumptuous editions of the Confucian classics, with the\r\nexpectation of acquiring a reputation for benevolence and intelligence.\r\nWu P'ei-fu, the most accomplished scholar among the military leaders of\r\nhis period, who owed part of his prestige to his scholarship, was\r\ndiligent in promoting Confucianism. With his decline (1926) his example\r\nwas no longer felt to be worth following; Confucianism as a practical\r\npolitical expedient passed from the scene. It gave too little sanction\r\nto the raising of local conscript armies, inflation of the currency, and\r\nthe doubling of taxes. Its complete silence on such necessities could\r\nnot be taken for consent.\r\n\r\nIn the Japanese-occupied territory in Manchuria, however, an interesting\r\nexperiment in Confucianism has been made. The customs and organization\r\nof the last Chinese dynasty have been resurrected, touched up by a few\r\nclassical scholars, given a somewhat more orthodox and unrealistic air,\r\nand proclaimed as the constitution of the Great Empire of Manchou\r\n(Manchoukuo). Since the effective government of the country is under\r\nstrong Japanese influence, the venture is significant only as a\r\npolitical narcotic. The laws proclaimed are in Chinese; the officials'\r\nnames are Chinese; the miranda of government, whatever the fact, are\r\nconsistent with the grand traditions of Chinese history. The Japanese\r\nmight have placed a handful of dreaming reactionaries in actual power\r\nand helped the growth of an anachronistic Chinese Empire in the\r\nnortheast, but they seem to have spoiled their opportunity of creating a\r\nfriendly and subservient state by acting too arbitrarily and making it\r\nimpossible for the Confucian experiment to work.\r\n\r\nConfucianism in modern China owes its position not so much to its\r\nprospects as to the fact that it has provided a frame of reference,\r\nhowever obsolescent, for the political struggle. Hence, through the\r\ntumultuous modern period, the Chinese have been strengthened by a\r\nphilosophy which emphasized the separateness and stability of each\r\ninstitution in society, and which did not make them lose all with the\r\nfortunes of a single supreme organization. As a positive political\r\nforce, Confucianism has done two things: It has kept the Chinese from\r\ndepending too much on political control, and it has provided a rationale\r\nin the contest for power. It accomplished the first by making police a\r\nfunction of society as a whole, by stressing the appropriateness of\r\nbehavior rather than its legality; and it has given the Chinese ethical\r\nvalues despite their sorry political condition. Confucianism has\r\nrationalized struggle by supplying each individual participant with a\r\ncode to apply if he came to power, and by giving him a good pretense for\r\nseeking power. Confucius himself lived in a time when Chinese political\r\norganization was chaotic. He noted the need for righteous men in high\r\nplaces and pointed out the good which could be done, apart from general\r\nreform, by the furtherance of virtue through scattered efforts.\r\nConfucius supplied the ambitious men of his own time with a reason for\r\naspiring to power--by making political responsibility a duty for the man\r\nof intelligence. The Confucian scholar was no saint contemplating\r\neternity; he was a proud, correct, self-righteous, patient individual,\r\nobliged by his training to take public office wherein his talent could\r\ngain wide influence.\r\n\r\nIn modern China, the seekers of political office have been able to avoid\r\nthe appearance of abject venality by professing respectability. Even\r\nthough they may have been just as corrupt as the politicians of other\r\nnations, and more efficiently so, they nevertheless had the saving grace\r\nto eschew hard realism and cloak their ambition with a pleasantly\r\nvirtuous tradition. A military leader could surround himself with a few\r\nscholars and give his efforts to reach power the air of a mild and\r\nwell-mannered crusade. Whenever political strife in China has had no\r\nmeaning but vanity and greed it has at least worn the decent cloak of\r\nthe Confucian tradition.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] For a good general introduction to Far Eastern history and politics\r\nsee G.

Now known primarily as the Nationalist movement, it has at\r\nvarious times emphasized different aspects of its program. In its\r\nsimplest and most fundamental points, the movement has fallen heir to\r\nearly patriotism. It has assumed different names: the Society for the\r\nRegeneration of China (1894-1905), or _Hsing Chung Hui_; the League of\r\nCommon Alliance (1905-1912), or _T'ung Mêng Hui_; the Nationalist\r\nDemocratic Party or National People's Party (1912-1914), or Kuomintang;\r\nthe Chung Hua Kê Ming Tang (1914-1920), or Chinese Revolutionary Party;\r\nand since 1920, again the _Kuomintang_. Kuomintang is the combination of\r\nthree Chinese words meaning \"country\" or \"realm,\" \"people,\" and \"party.\"\r\nThe name of the party can be translated in innumerable ways: nationalist\r\ndemocratic, nationalist popular, national people's party, etc. The\r\ncommonest rendering is \"Nationalist,\" but it is to be remembered that\r\nthe word \"people\" figures in the name. Furthermore, the Chinese version\r\nof patriotism has more cosmopolitan and fewer restrictive connotations\r\nthan patriotism ever had in the West.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nationalism: Patriotic Anti-Manchu Phase_\r\n\r\nEven in a world society that knew neither state nor nation the Chinese\r\nfelt attached to their homes and their native land, which led them to\r\nrepel invaders. They never personified this loyalty or tried to express\r\nit in specific institutions; nor did they admit outsiders to equality\r\nand concede that there was more of the civilized world outside, thus\r\nadmitting the existence of nations. Their attitude rested on sentiment\r\nrather than theory. There was no elaborate bolstering of Chinese racial\r\nsuperiority, for--by and large--all the peoples in China, conquerors or\r\nconquered, seemed racially alike, fused under the pressure of great\r\nsocial homogeneity.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Manchu conquest (about 1644) the Chinese developed a\r\npassionate hatred for the invaders from the northeast. In entrenching\r\nthemselves the Manchus committed a fateful blunder which was to bring\r\nmomentary strength but ultimate ruin: they enforced racial segregation\r\nin the political, social, and economic sphere. Legend has it that a\r\nChinese statesman, forced into Manchu service, suggested this plan and\r\nthus laid the cornerstone for the eventual Chinese liberation. The\r\nManchus prohibited miscegenation; they established Manchu garrisons\r\nthroughout the Empire, keeping their troops from work (which might have\r\nled to intermingling with the Chinese) and thus ruining them by sloth. A\r\nfixed quota of Manchus was introduced into the government service,\r\nirrespective of the operation of the examination system. In time the\r\nChinese scholars submitted willingly enough to the alien rule; two of\r\nthe Manchu emperors were the most enlightened patrons which Chinese\r\nletters and arts had had in centuries, and the intellectual opposition\r\ndwindled away to a minimum.\r\n\r\nAmong the populace there was no such general reconciliation. Deprived\r\nfor the first time of scholarly leadership, the common people, peasants\r\nand artisans, organized numerous secret societies. The societies\r\nflourished, coming to supersede the government in whole areas and\r\nmarking many decades with insurrection and riot. Scholars fought the\r\nsecret societies because of their uncouth rituals, their heterodoxy of\r\nideas, their opposition to the existing system. The societies answered\r\nby building up political agencies which were able to act on the lower\r\nand more generally understood levels of ideology.\r\n\r\nThese groups kept patriotism afire. The greatest of their uprisings, the\r\nT'ai-p'ing rebellion of 1849-1865, was put down with the assistance of\r\nthe Western Christian states, but it left a permanent mark on Chinese\r\nsociety. The rebels had shown that it was possible to wrest the greater\r\npart of China from Manchu rule. They were the first to welcome the\r\ninvasion of Christianity, adopting a fantastically modified Christian\r\nfaith. They awakened the Chinese to the immediate possibility of a war\r\nof liberation against the outsiders who held the throne of the Chinese\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe T'ai-p'ing rebellion showed its strength as a patriotic movement. It\r\nwas successful in shaking the established ideology with a rival\r\ncompounded of the more vulgar parts of the old, combined with\r\nChristianity. And it indicated the weakest point of the\r\ndynasty--governmental inadequacy in dealing with the agrarian problem.\r\nThe years of formal stability gave China a much increased population;\r\nthe same years were years of political decline which raised the cost of\r\ngovernment. A house-cleaning was in order. The T'ai-p'ing demonstrated\r\nthe need for it; the Manchu dynasty refused to yield to the demand.\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen was born in 1866 or 1867. An uncle of his had been one of\r\nthe rebels. At Sun's parental home the countryside had known of the\r\nT'ai-p'ing rebellion; many in his native village had participated in it.\r\nHe was as patriotic as any Chinese could be in the far south, where the\r\nManchu conquest had penetrated least deeply, but his patriotism did not\r\ndiffer from the patriotism of his neighbors until he came to know life\r\noutside China. From the patriotism of the old Chinese realm to the\r\nnationalism required of China in the new Westernized world--this was a\r\nstep to be traversed only by rich personal experience.\r\n\r\nSun took this step as a boy, when he went to Honolulu. He soon was\r\nconverted to Christianity, learned English, and became acquainted with\r\nWestern life. He was able to see the world in terms of nations, and he\r\nsaw that from the Western point of view China was a large but weak\r\nnation. Already committed from childhood to the revolutionary cause, he\r\nwas led by his knowledge of the West to change patriotism into\r\nnationalism. When he returned to China, after studying medicine in\r\nHongkong, he arrived with the notion of transforming the old world\r\ncommunity into an effective modern nation-state.\r\n\r\nHe did not seem at first to realize how necessary it was to dispose of\r\nthe monarchy. For a while he petitioned the authorities, trusting that\r\nimmediate reforms might be effected within the existing framework,\r\npending an ultimate revolution of patriots. His success must be measured\r\nin terms of what he and his few fellow workers learned, rather than of\r\nwhat they accomplished. His technique of revolution was based upon the\r\nestablished traditions of Chinese history--the formation of a small\r\nnucleus, the gathering of affiliated groups, the permeation of a\r\nregional bureaucracy when possible, and the launching of terroristic\r\nattacks to shake the apparent stability of the government.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of his work he came into contact with the secret\r\ngroups. When he started organizing in earnest, the first major\r\ndevelopment was the admittance en bloc of a small secret society. In an\r\nunpublished autobiography Sun wrote: \"After my graduation I practised\r\nmedicine in Canton and Macao as a pretext for spreading my revolutionary\r\nideas.\"[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nationalism: Revolutionary Modernist Phase_\r\n\r\nThe Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895 was the cause of much disturbance in\r\nChina and the first major event to shake the belief of the masses in\r\ntheir own ideology. Fantastic barbarians with deadly contrivances might\r\nharry the coasts and even allow themselves impertinences with the\r\ndynasty, but the situation became different when a small, inoffensive,\r\nineffectual neighbor nation took over these same weapons and spoiled the\r\ninternal arrangements of the Far Eastern universe. The peripheral\r\ncountries could perhaps even demolish the central suzerainty; this was\r\nthe _mene-tekel_ of the Empire.\r\n\r\nThe revolutionary organization of Sun Yat-sen had by now become\r\ndefinitely modernist, nationalist, and antimonarchical, instead of\r\nmerely patriotic and antidynastic. Under the name of _Hsing Chung Hui_\r\nthere was established a confederacy of secret societies. After a short\r\nwhile the member societies were liquidated, and a modern revolutionary\r\norganization emerged, advocating overthrow of the Manchus. The\r\nintellectual elite of this group had no part in the ideological control\r\nwhich gripped the rest of China, in the form of the traditional\r\nmandarinate. As a new elite, with a new ideology, it broke the monopoly\r\nof leadership, the monopoly of thought. The consequences cannot be\r\nexaggerated. It was symptomatic that Sun's own family became estranged\r\nin part and that many members of the society had to die a civil death\r\nbefore working in the organization. They left their property to heirs\r\nand changed their names, lest--under the principle of group\r\nresponsibility--terrible punishments be visited upon their native\r\nvillages and their families. Furthermore, an important bloc of\r\nparticipants consisted of Chinese from overseas.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese overseas were for the most part men who had been kidnaped\r\nand sold in the coolie trade or who had stealthily deserted their native\r\nregions for adventure and wealth. With the increased foreign commerce it\r\nwas possible for many Chinese to become wealthier outside their own\r\ncountry than within. But in leaving they left their custom and tradition\r\nand met peoples--especially Europeans and Americans--whose way of life,\r\nthough utterly different, was effective in the practical, tangible terms\r\nof wealth and security. Chinese in increasing numbers bettered their\r\ncondition outside. They did not amass wealth through family effort, nor\r\ndid they broaden their learning through the classics. What they won,\r\nthey won themselves; and they learned something for which the Confucian\r\nideology had no place. When they returned home, they were greeted with\r\ncontempt, though also with covert admiration. Those among them who had\r\ngathered knowledge of the West, of modern methods of business, of\r\nEuropean languages, found that in the eyes of the traditional literati\r\nand officials they were lower than the lowest illiterates.\r\n\r\nSuch men came in great numbers to the revolutionary party. Among\r\noverseas Chinese merchants, workers, and students, there developed a\r\ngroup--possessing power in the form of money and family\r\nconnections--which was determined to overthrow the existing order and\r\nbring China in line with the outside world. Their effort was idealistic,\r\nbecause the Chinese overseas felt that the economic and cultural\r\nadvantages of the West should be secured for their countrymen at home;\r\nit was also realistic, since they were fighting in the only way they\r\nknew for a respectable, honorable return to their homes. They could not\r\nthrow their lives away and admit that their ventures and dangers were of\r\nno profit. They felt that they had acquired something, and they wanted\r\nit recognized. It was Sun Yat-sen who showed them how they could do it.\r\n\r\nIn a sense, this feature of the Nationalist movement might be taken as\r\nthe pivot of modern Chinese government and politics. Controlling men\r\nthrough controlling their minds and through making sure that every\r\npossible leader would lead from within the hierarchy--these devices of\r\nthe past had failed. There were now Chinese to whom the Confucian rules\r\nwere pleasant and homelike but not the real material of modern life.\r\nThese Chinese possessed intellectually trained leaders who had nothing\r\nin common with the dominant elite--who were more interested in building\r\nrailroads, improving water supplies, defending China's frontiers, and\r\nmodernizing the country than in augmenting the virtue of mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nationalism: Republican Phase_\r\n\r\nEvery year brought the Nationalists increased strength. The Manchu court\r\nyielded a series of constitutional reforms which by their promises\r\ndisturbed the minds of those still content with the old order and by\r\ntheir nonfulfillment raised fresh storms of resentment against the\r\nManchu rule. The court did not really seek to master the drift in the\r\nthought of the people; it tried to defeat change rather than direct\r\nit.[2] In a few short years before and after 1900 the Dragon Throne\r\ndeclined from the supreme office of mankind to an obsolete and\r\npicturesque ornament of a government so weak and disorganized as to\r\nrender ornament artificial. While the Empire lost prestige, the\r\nNationalists came to emphasize the republican part of their program more\r\nand more. As Nationalists, they differed little from the generations of\r\npatriots who had fought the alien rulers of China. As republicans, they\r\nwere the Chinese vanguard of modernization. Some people accepted\r\nrepublican ideas as good in themselves; far more thought them better\r\nthan the Manchu rule, especially since there was no Chinese pretender in\r\nsight--the heir of the Mings, the last native dynasty, was a pensioner\r\nin Peking. A large number probably thought little about the abstract\r\nissue one way or another but trusted the revolutionary leaders because\r\nthey seemed to have a competence consonant with the times.\r\n\r\nAs the Nationalists advanced, they reorganized their party mechanism,\r\nand formed the T'ung Mêng Hui in 1905. At this time the principles which\r\nwere later to become the _San Min Chu I_[3] were given public\r\nformulation. The Nationalists began to feel the necessity of an ideology\r\nwith which to replace that of the Confucian monarchy. It had been\r\npossible to leave doubt unsettled so long as they were a small,\r\nconspiratorial group. As soon as they began to secure adherents among\r\nthe masses it became necessary to provide their followers with a common\r\nset of ideas. In seeking agreement on fundamentals, they found\r\ndisagreements within the party. Sun Yat-sen's role began to change from\r\nconspiracy to statesmanship. The future was to show that even a\r\nstatesman was not enough--that a lawgiver, a state founder, was needed.\r\n\r\nThe T'ung Mêng Hui was one of the most effective revolutionary\r\norganizations which the modern world has seen, so far as achievement of\r\nimmediate aims was concerned. In a series of activities which would\r\nrouse a mystery-story addict to startled incredulity, the\r\nrevolutionaries tried to awaken the populace by spectacular revolts.\r\nThey capitalized on the impotence of a government alien to China, one so\r\nineffectual that it could not protect the Chinese from the other, newer\r\naliens who had appeared. They realized that it was hopeless to attack\r\nthe monarchy along its entire front, since the old ideological guidance,\r\nalthough waning, still held the broad masses in inertia. The\r\nrevolutionaries accordingly attacked the Empire at its top level, its\r\nmost obvious and conspicuous points of strength--the military and\r\npolitical headquarters of the viceroyalties and other significant\r\npositions. Knowing that they themselves could not monopolize the\r\ngovernment of China, they looked forward to attaining a position of\r\nleadership among the various groups in the Chinese society and to\r\nkeeping that leadership through parliamentary methods to be established\r\nunder the Republic. Instead of regarding the Empire as a set of\r\ninstitutions, they considered it the mere decoration of the country.\r\nThey had no reason to suppose, nor any way of telling, that in\r\ndestroying the old regime they destroyed government and all possibility\r\nof government for a long time to come. They consequently tried to set in\r\nmotion a snowball revolution--an initial conspiracy of terror which\r\nwould intimidate the Manchus and cause the whole house of cards to\r\ncollapse. It was their task only to start the movement, which could be\r\ncounted upon to avalanche itself into history.\r\n\r\nTo the revolutionary group a republican scheme seemed possible. They\r\nfelt that in the twentieth century men would disagree but amicably, and\r\nthey regarded democracy as a form of government so excellent that its\r\nmere inauguration would guarantee success. Furthermore, republicanism\r\nand democracy were closely associated with nationalism; how could a\r\nnation be free unless it governed itself in the most direct\r\nmanner--through the votes of its broad majorities?\r\n\r\nIn failing to provide a stopping point for the revolution before they\r\nstarted it, the Nationalists were scarcely guilty of rash action. No\r\nhuman being could have foretold the consequences of revolt against a\r\ncivilization. The revolutionaries were men who had passed through the\r\ntransition from the old Confucian ideology to that of the West with\r\nrelative ease. They did not realize that what was obvious to them would\r\nbe a mystery to the masses and that the political changes contemplated\r\nwould rip asunder the very fabric of thought in China. It is evidence of\r\nthe simplicity and usefulness of Confucian ideas that--even when\r\nadmitted to be challenged by the new environment--they continued to\r\noperate without the sanction of intelligence, and operated well as empty\r\nhabits.\r\n\r\nWith the old patriotic forces behind them, and an untested Utopia ahead,\r\nthe Nationalists raced the Manchu Empire into revolution. The story of\r\nthe revolution is not complex.[4] In a great part of China the people\r\nawoke to find no government. In the North the imperial officials and\r\nprinces clamored for the assistance of a man whom they had once\r\nslighted: Yüan Shih-k'ai, the leader of the modernized armies of the\r\nEmpire. He held the fate of China in his hands. But he betrayed the\r\nEmpire so that he might betray the Republic; he joined the\r\nrevolutionaries and thrust a settlement upon the ruling house. With his\r\nintervention the whole picture of Chinese politics changed. Yüan brought\r\ntroops into the play of power, troops dependent upon himself, men no\r\nlonger interested in ideas now that the all-compelling force of the old\r\nway of thought was gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nationalism: Constitutionalist Phase_\r\n\r\nThe Republic at Nanking enjoyed a brief Utopian existence, with Sun\r\nYat-sen as its president. The revolutionaries were independent from\r\nOctober, 1911, to March, 1912, when the Republic became the instrument\r\nof Yüan Shih-k'ai. No substantial power accrued to the legislative.\r\n\r\nDuring their bright heyday of power as a parliamentary party under the\r\nRepublic--which they had founded only to give it away to the\r\nmilitary--the Nationalists were known as the _Kuomintang_. At this time\r\nthe Chinese name of the party was significantly translated \"Democratic\r\nParty.\" Sun Yat-sen and the revolutionaries had expected that the\r\nChinese people would accept the new ideology without understanding it\r\nand then would come to understand it very quickly. They could not hope\r\nto replace the old ideology before the revolution, because the presence\r\nof the imperial government made large-scale educational work impossible.\r\nAfter the establishment of the Republic, however, they found themselves\r\nhamstrung because they had not inculcated republicanism. It was a\r\nvicious circle. The governmental pattern set up at Nanking was replaced\r\nby another to make room for Yüan Shih-k'ai, who proposed a third, in\r\nwhich he should have more power, in order that he might create a fourth\r\ngovernment, in which he should be emperor.[5] The armies of the\r\nrevolutionaries, such as they were, became absorbed in the forces of\r\nYüan. When, in a few months, the Republic had been won and lost, the\r\nNationalists realized that the revolution of 1911-1912 was only the\r\nfirst step in their labors. They experimented with a minor revolution in\r\n1913, and then turned to other measures for securing a return to\r\nconstitutional government and the creation of a republic which should be\r\nas firmly rooted in men's minds as the majestic but irretrievable\r\nConfucian order had been. They had won the revolution by creating doubt\r\nand giving it tangible expression; they lost their revolution because\r\ndoubt persisted, swallowed everything, leaving China in a turmoil beyond\r\nall systematic thought.\r\n\r\nThe first years of the nominal Republic, the beginning of the new order\r\nin China, were marked by a feverish pretense of changed forms. The\r\noutlook which superseded the ancient ideology was curious. It was a\r\nmixture of traditionalist acceptance of temporary disorder and\r\nresignation to a period of transformation into an unconceived and\r\nunproclaimed future. This outlook gave life no purpose, but it kept men\r\nfrom falling into complete anarchy. People were willing to accept\r\nillegal authorities, since local administrators had traditionally\r\nmaintained a spotty cloak of public order. Modern Chinese were prepared\r\nto pay lip service to a preposterous parliamentary regime but soon found\r\nthat it was comfortable to think in terms such as armies, foreign\r\ninterference, and money--thus allowing their thinking to settle in the\r\nlarge framework of an accepted disorder.\r\n\r\nThe Nationalists tried to combat this anticonstitutional way of thought.\r\nFor six years (1914-1920) they combined conspiratorial techniques with\r\nthe role of a legally constituted power fighting for law. They assumed\r\nthe name _Chinese Revolutionary Party_ until they discovered that they\r\ncould secure no ideological foothold upon which to base the order they\r\nproposed. Some of them went so far as to become anarchists, favoring a\r\ncontinuance of disorder until the world joined China in collapse. Others\r\nfollowed an unrealistic legalism; they held to the paper constitution,\r\nto the text of the president's oath of allegiance to the constitution,\r\nto the election laws, thinking that the magic of ink would conjure up a\r\ngovernment. Sun Yat-sen, and the body of his followers with him,\r\nattempted to chart a middle course; in 1917 there was created a \"lawful\"\r\nadministration in the South. With extraordinary good fortune the\r\nRepublic might have succeeded, but the war in Europe, the Japanese\r\ninterventions, and other adverse circumstances prevented this.\r\n\r\nThe Nationalists changed the name of their party back to _Kuomintang_\r\nafter 1920 but did not discontinue their reformist policies until about\r\ntwo years later. Sun Yat-sen had spent years in study and propaganda;\r\neventually his program became an ideology. No sharp line can be drawn\r\nbetween the two. In some respects the very first programs of the\r\nrevolutionaries were ideological, in that they presupposed a change in\r\nman's outlook which would accommodate republican government. On the\r\nother hand, programmatic proposals may be distinguished from ideological\r\ntheses by the fact that programs refer to things which should be done\r\nand ideologies to things in which men should believe in order to do\r\nanything at all. A program which is rooted in no ideology is one lacking\r\ncontext; unless a program refers to some accepted scheme of thought it\r\nis words in a vacuum. Similarly, an ideology without programs to put it\r\ninto men's minds, to persuade men to believe in it and give it effect,\r\nis an airy prettiness for philosophers. The Nationalists had stood on\r\nthe foundations of Confucian common sense and proposed a republic; they\r\nhad destroyed the organization which made that common sense seem real\r\nand had cut the ground from under their own feet. They could not\r\ndistinguish values because their critical attitude enveloped all moral\r\nnotions or made them isolated points without coherent significance. The\r\nNationalists themselves fell prey to day-dreaming when they appealed to\r\nworthless paper for their right to govern. The epoch is significant in\r\nthe history of the movement in that it taught the Nationalists that men\r\nwould not fight unless there was something to fight for and that there\r\nwas nothing to fight for until men could find desirable elements\r\nembedded in some larger scheme of life. Politics had to have an end and\r\nan environment; without either it was a series of monologues in the\r\nwilderness, the soliloquies of logicians.\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen during this time wrote the drafts of monumental treatises\r\nwhich were to relate the general body of his doctrines to the background\r\nof fact and thought from which they had emerged. He never finished them,\r\nbut meanwhile he and his followers realized that if they were to have a\r\ngrip over government they must grasp power within the brains of men. The\r\nrevolutionary reformists had to supply some better medium of persuasion\r\nthan the frivolity of military cynicism or the impudence of shadow\r\ngovernment. They had to abandon legalism and bring forth an ideology\r\ncapable of serving as the new foundation for a just and effective system\r\nof government in China. If their original importance was that of an\r\neffective counter-elite springing up in the intellectual borderlands\r\nbetween the Western and Chinese ideologies, their second period of\r\nsignificance begins with their realization that a new framework of\r\nthought would have to be set up before any of their programs could be\r\neffectuated.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Political Doctrines of Sun Yat-sen_\r\n\r\nThe ideology which the Nationalists were to teach was one which had lain\r\ndormant in the party for more than thirty years. It was the invention of\r\nSun Yat-sen--his reinterpretation of Confucianism to suit the modern\r\nworld. He did not settle down with books before him, pen in hand and\r\nnotebooks all about, to formulate a Utopia; nor did he approach the\r\nsubject as a historian, seeking scientific causes for the emotions and\r\nloyalties of men. He came to the subject as a political leader,\r\nmodifying the given background only so far as was necessary. His\r\ndoctrines grew with his personal growth and the development of his\r\nmovement. They are scattered among a variety of writings and utterances,\r\nand are contradictory in many points although remarkably consistent as a\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen asked himself: What is China? China is a race, he said, a\r\nrace which was once great and which held benevolent world leadership in\r\nthe world it knew. It has declined because it has fallen upon evil days,\r\nunder the rule of outsiders, barbarians, and has failed to develop in\r\nways which the West discovered. This race should be a nation in the\r\nmodern world; a great, powerful, united, effective nation in a world of\r\nnations. It should fight for its right of self-rule and should support\r\njustice in the international community. In order to achieve greatness,\r\nthe Chinese will have to turn their nation into an effective state and\r\nadd the devices of law to the devices of social control through\r\nideology. They should rethink their ideology, keeping the old ethical\r\nphilosophy and the old social knowledge (the technique of control\r\nthrough thought, as in Confucianism) but adding Western technics. They\r\nshould then strive to make their nation the leader in progress toward\r\nworld peace and eventual cosmopolitanism. China should turn to\r\nnationalism for the time--decades or centuries--that remained for the\r\ntravail of nations, but the Chinese should never forget the world\r\nsociety whence they came. This is the first of Sun's three principles,\r\n_nationalism_.\r\n\r\nThe second principle referred to the problem of leadership and the\r\norganization of government. Obviously, the Chinese could not return to\r\nmonarchy in the modern world. In the first place, it would not be\r\nmodern; Sun lived at a time when the democratic tide was sweeping to its\r\nhigh point and when the world triumph of democracy seemed a foregone\r\nconclusion. Secondly, Sun thought it disloyal to China's past for the\r\nChinese to evade the responsibility of democracy, as it was implicit in\r\ntheir most ancient traditions and thus an obligation laid upon them by\r\ntheir first great leaders. Thirdly, he thought that good administration\r\nwas to be derived from democracy more readily than from any other\r\nsystem. Fourthly, because democracy was a modernizing force, it should\r\nbe introduced; the people, participating in progress, would themselves\r\nbecome progressive. Fifthly and most necessarily, democracy was simply\r\nthe self-control of a nation. If the nation was to be created and made\r\nfree through nationalism it had to become democratic, since there was no\r\nother way for a whole people to express and rule itself. But the Chinese\r\nneeded specific devices[6] in order to assure that the old system of\r\nselecting an intellectual leadership would not be compromised or\r\ndestroyed by democracy. They should see to it that democracy did not\r\nbecome mob rule. The Chinese people should become self-indoctrinating\r\nand thus maintain ideological control along with political. But the\r\nChinese should accommodate the concept of the state in their thinking,\r\nsince the concentration of power in Western states made it necessary\r\nthat there be in China an equivalent social device for canalizing and\r\nconcentrating power, in order to meet Western and Japanese attacks. The\r\negalitarian features of democracy should be congenial to the democracy\r\nof customs and manners which was indigenous to old China. This was the\r\nsecond principle, _democracy_.\r\n\r\nThe third principle was the restatement in modern political terms of the\r\ncardinal economic principles of the past, together with an infusion of\r\nnewly invented doctrines. It protected the livelihood of the people, and\r\nmay be summed up in a single sentence: No government deserves to exist\r\nunless it assures its people of the maximum of material welfare possible\r\nunder prevailing physical conditions. Government was of no use if the\r\npeople perished. The state was nothing if its substance was lost.\r\nPolitical leadership should aim at constant improvement of economic\r\nconditions, spread economic benefits, and make the nation healthy. In\r\ndoing so it was not to be bound by any creed of capitalism or communism\r\nbut was to experiment and seek the most efficient measures for the\r\nbenefit of the whole community. This last principle involved the _life_\r\nof the nation, as nationalism did its _birth_ and democracy its\r\n_freedom_. It was an ethical doctrine rather than a schematic principle,\r\nand cannot be properly translated. It should best be left in the\r\nChinese, and expressed by two words which mean \"people\" and\r\n\"generation\": _min shêng_.\r\n\r\nThis ideology gave the Nationalists a faith to propagate. It was\r\ndesigned to achieve the revision of the old Confucian ideology;\r\nexperience and the accepted ideology would supply this new skeleton with\r\nflesh. It differed radically from the Marxian doctrine in that it was\r\ntraditionalistic and nationalistic; it resembled the Marxian doctrine in\r\nthat it sought to create a whole new intellectual civilization before\r\nturning to the question of government.\r\n\r\nThe new ideology had to make headway against other propagandas, the\r\npartially adequate ways of thought which had grown up since the\r\nestablishment of the Republic. It had to restore life to the vast corpse\r\nof Confucianism, and soon after its first general promulgation (1924)\r\nhad to fight its temporary ally--communism--for power over Chinese\r\nminds.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Opportunist Movements and their Anticonstitutional Effects_\r\n\r\nThe field which the Nationalists invaded to propagate their doctrines\r\nwas already occupied. The slow evaporation of the Confucian moral,\r\nintellectual, and social system had given rise to various movements\r\nwhich, for lack of a better term, may be called _half-ideological_.\r\nThese movements made no pretense of presenting a new order sufficient\r\nfor Chinese thought and belief, but--in the opinion of those\r\nconstituting them--they did afford an adequate frame of reference for\r\nimmediate action. Some of the half-ideologies were: (1) military\r\nfeudalism, (2) provincial _tuchünism_ (3) China-wide militarism, (4)\r\nbureaucratism, and (5) capitalism. Although none of them succeeded in\r\nindoctrinating broad masses of the population, yet each was effective in\r\na negative way. Each obstructed the development of any coherent system\r\nof social and political life. Each was anticonstitutional, since it\r\nproposed to constitute a scheme narrowly pragmatic or unattainable in\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nThe presence of these movements gave China an appearance of considerable\r\nfreedom in the earlier years of the Republican era. Diversity of opinion\r\nbased upon a fundamental concord in outlook--diversity circumscribed by\r\none cohesive ideology--may be most wholesome in social and political\r\nlife. When diversity penetrates so deep as to include all major aspects\r\nof human existence, it becomes insupportable, a hindrance and not a\r\nstimulant to action. When policy is predetermined by tradition, thought\r\nis easy, action relatively more difficult; when there is discord even on\r\nfundamentals, thought is difficult, action easy. Almost any scheme\r\nmitigating the evils of discord will be assured a hearing; if the world\r\ncannot be rationalized, the individual will be.\r\n\r\nYüan Shih-k'ai inaugurated, in his efforts to control China through\r\nmilitary means, a way of thought which might be characterized as\r\nmilitary feudalism of the twentieth century variety, an order based upon\r\ncontract between commander and soldier, upon the payment of wages by the\r\nformer and the performance of any task by the latter. This militarism\r\nnever flowered in literature, never developed a political theory, never\r\nachieved governmental form. Even Yüan felt its inadequacy as a state\r\nphilosophy, and by his attempt to establish a modern monarchy ruined\r\nwhat chances he might have had for anticipating Mussolini with a Fascist\r\nmovement. As it was, the movement of military thought was derived from\r\nthe facts rather than propagated to excuse the facts. The militarists\r\nthemselves abandoned it whenever they found substitutes.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the movement for a military ideology was at times the\r\nprevailing mode of thought among the men who held power in China. They\r\nwere able to gain perspective on their own behavior by reference to the\r\nold traditions, regarding themselves as upright magistrates in a time of\r\nchaos. For working purposes they could claim from their subordinates and\r\nsuperiors a vague constitutionalism limited to army circles. Amid the\r\ncowardice, betrayal, and corruption in the military dictatorships,\r\ntendencies occasionally appeared leading toward an effective military\r\nspirit. Certain kinds of betrayal or cruelty were beyond the limits of\r\ngood soldiering, but not many.\r\n\r\nA more effective explanation for the condition of the armies in China\r\nfrom 1916 to about 1931 may be found in _tuchünism_. A _tuchün_ was a\r\nmilitary commandant ruling an area ranging from a few districts to a\r\nnumber of provinces.[7] The imperial regime maintained a military\r\ncounterpart to the provincial governor. After the Republican Revolution\r\nprovinces tended to become separate and autonomous under military\r\nleaders. The military man, who was prone to apologize for his position\r\nby admitting that he was not developing a permanent establishment, who\r\nheld his troops together by a modern feudalism, could also rationalize\r\nhis role by presenting himself to his province as a good son, by\r\nstressing the wickedness and strangeness of the soldiers in other\r\nprovinces, and by suggesting the thought of federalism. The scheme was\r\nnot convincing or edifying, but it could become temporarily popular. A\r\ngreat part of the news from China is still written in terms of\r\n_tuchünism_--since it is a simple pattern and requires no explanation\r\ninvolving Chinese peculiarities. Satrapies have become tyrannies in all\r\nages. At the very best the _tuchünist_ movement could not have served\r\nwell as the constituent force of a new China. It would necessarily have\r\nended in one-man government, almost unthinkable with modern Chinese\r\nconditions; or it would have implied a military federalism which is\r\nscarcely a solution to the problem of unity.\r\n\r\nMilitary cliques at times had China-wide proportions, but despite the\r\nproclamations which were occasionally issued, there was no effective\r\nsingle movement for a general military regime. Such movements as there\r\nwere developed within the framework of the shadow Republic. Moreover,\r\nthe shifting alignments of Chinese wars within the nominal organization\r\nof the Republic were so confused as to make almost anything but order\r\nseem possible. Yet many Chinese thought in terms of a \"realism\"\r\ncompounded of slogans and military exigencies.\r\n\r\nIf movements for military feudalism, provincial _tuchünism_, and (most\r\nnebulous of all) China-wide militarism failed to provide more than an\r\nexplanation of immediate fact, there were counterparts in the civilian\r\nadministration aspiring to political autonomy for particular cliques.\r\nMinistries tended at times to develop a spirit of independence. Finance\r\nwas too close to the military, but the revenue collection services (with\r\na large European and Japanese personnel) and the postal services behaved\r\nas _imperia in imperio_. The foreign office functioned frequently\r\nwithout effective superiors. Working without pay a great part of the\r\ntime, in a period which offered no near solution for its disastrous\r\ntroubles, bureaucrats saw in the increase of bureaucracy a possible\r\ninauguration of order. The ministries did function in a way, despite the\r\nchaos about them. They might have evolved a new bureaucratism to steal\r\nthe _tuchüns'_ power. Their spirit was helpful in particular and\r\ndamaging in general, since it was bound to sabotage any government which\r\nmight come to power. A few years of insecurity may weld a bureaucracy\r\ntogether more closely than would decades of spoils; this was the case\r\nbetween 1916 and 1928. Bureaucratism demonstrates the limitations of\r\nopportunist ideology as a foundation for government.\r\n\r\nCapitalism flourished wherever economic conditions made it possible;\r\nsuch economic conditions did not last very long under the jurisdiction\r\nof the military. In treaty ports[8] the Chinese capitalists prospered,\r\nsecure under governments which were international in effect, Chinese\r\nonly in legal fiction. There Chinese soon amassed enough capital to\r\ncompete with economic institutions erected by foreigners, and exercised\r\nan important indirect influence on the growth of Chinese government.\r\nCapitalism helped to thwart a peasant-labor alliance in China, for\r\nalthough the capitalists were an insignificant minority without\r\ncountry-wide influence, its form of control was mobile. No army, no\r\nsurge of popular resentment, no propaganda, no conspirator can travel as\r\nfast as a telegraphic money order. The ideology of capitalism was\r\ncontent in China to remain subordinate as long as the political and\r\nlegal conditions were favorable to it. Capitalist groups supported any\r\nsort of strong government which might protect property and increase\r\nopportunities for investment.\r\n\r\nAmong the most pitiful of the movements for the construction of a\r\ngeneral agreement in China were the proalien movements. They were\r\npitiful because they represented a prostitution of thought by men\r\nconscious of the nature of their action. The Anfu Party flourished in\r\nthe first decade after the death of Yüan in 1916; together with its\r\nmilitarism and its meaningless \"realism\" it was pro-Japanese. The\r\npresent \"government\" in North China[9] is another such movement.\r\nManchoukuo bases little of her official ideology on such a dangerous\r\noutlook and prefers to propagate a Confucianist traditionalism in so far\r\nas she propagates anything. Pro-Japanese action may express a discontent\r\nwith the competence of the Chinese for self-government, but more\r\nforcefully it relates to theories of Pan-Asianism or Pan-Mongolism.\r\n\r\nThe opportunist movements--militarism, _tuchünism_, military federalism,\r\nbureaucratic separatism, capitalism, and political puppetry--served to\r\nconfuse the basic alternatives. Because they reflected a narrow and\r\naccidental scheme of power rather than long-range transformation, they\r\npossessed a specious realism which obfuscated real issues. They\r\ndistracted attention without rewarding it and polarized opinion around\r\nconflicts which were beyond settlement. There is no possibility of\r\nagreement between men who think one another deluded in regard to\r\nfundamentals. Disorder in China was the more violent because of these\r\ndifferent explanations. They delayed the creation of a framework in\r\nwhich men could find a common reasonableness, an ideology sufficient to\r\nrationalize all interests and to sublimate all frustrations.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Christianity as a Political Force_\r\n\r\nEver since the establishment of American and British Protestant missions\r\nin the nineteenth century, Christianity has been a conditioning force\r\nfor a democratic ideology in Asia.[10] The Protestants were among the\r\nfirst to make a breach in the stronghold of Confucianism; they secured\r\ninternational action to assist them. Their role was that of\r\ncounter-ideologues whose position was guaranteed by treaty (British\r\nTreaty of Tientsin, 1858; American Treaty of Tientsin, 1858). They\r\npossessed the power, under the legal sanction of the Chinese government,\r\nto preach against the moral foundations upon which that government\r\nrested. A missionary wrote in 1887:\r\n\r\n  The foremost opposition to the introduction of Christianity comes from\r\n  those who esteem themselves the followers of Confucius. They assent to\r\n  our views about the \"emptiness\" of Buddhism, the deceptions of Taoism,\r\n  the character of the priesthood, the mud and stone of the images, but\r\n  when we gently allude to ancestral idolatry, the worship of heaven and\r\n  earth, and the sacrifices of the mandarins, they are offended. Also,\r\n  the Confucianists do the thinking for the people; they have the minds,\r\n  the books, the schools, and the offices. Without a long residence in\r\n  the country it is hard to imagine the influence of a penniless scholar\r\n  in his neighbourhood, and the mental control he exercises over the\r\n  minds of the peasantry. More than this, the graduates at the\r\n  government examinations form a clique or \"ring,\" and their voice is\r\n  the unwritten law of China, their authority above that of His\r\n  Excellency the Governor. The lamented Carstairs Douglas said at the\r\n  Shanghai Missionary Conference of 1877, \"Confucianism is the citadel;\r\n  take it, and the war is ended.\"[11]\r\n\r\nBut for the presence of Christianity, a Chinese counter-elite with\r\nsufficient moral self-assurance and intellectual ability to attack the\r\ntraditional institutions of the Empire might not have developed. Sun\r\nYat-sen was a Christian, although in his case Christianity has been less\r\nof a modernizing force compared with the influence of his actual\r\nexperience abroad. Large numbers of the reformist and republican leaders\r\nwere Christian, some of them with missionary or Y. M. C. A. connections.\r\nThese men were not bound by the moral tenets of Confucianism; those\r\namong them who had mission school educations had little in common with\r\nthe long intellectual tradition of the Chinese. For a while Christianity\r\nspelled Westernization and provided an avenue of self-advancement\r\nhitherto unprecedented in China--one outside the archaic scheme of\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nWith the coming of the Republic, Christian ethics appeared to have an\r\nopen field. The emphasis which Christianity places upon the value of\r\nindividual human life was favorable to the emergence of modern\r\nrepublican institutions. Even Yüan Shih-k'ai is said to have\r\nacknowledged the influence of Christianity in this respect; he is\r\nreported to have said, in an interview with a leading missionary\r\neducator, \"You missionaries are responsible for this revolution. Now you\r\nmust see us through.\"[12] The implication of doctrines of human\r\nbrotherhood is obvious, despite the fact that such doctrines--in less\r\nforceful and spiritual form--were a familiar feature of certain Chinese\r\nphilosophies.\r\n\r\nIn its more direct effects Christianity demonstrated a variety of new\r\npoints to the Chinese. The intervention of the missionaries was not only\r\nmoral; it was scientific, and the early mission leaders brought Western\r\nengineering and industrial methods with them. They published the first\r\njournal in Chinese to give regular accounts of practical mechanics. As\r\nthe missions themselves developed, the physical presence of the\r\nProtestant missionaries and of Western ways of life--to which they\r\nadhered in contrast with the Catholics--became strong informational\r\ninfluences. Later the rise of churches and of Christian establishments\r\ngave the Chinese experience in the Western methods of social and\r\nbusiness organization.\r\n\r\nIn practical administration the Christian impact has been striking.\r\nAmerican missionaries were influential in developing popular education\r\nin China. They have led the way in public health. They have organized\r\nmodel orphanages and have assailed infanticide, footbinding, and\r\nconcubinage. They have been the public opinion of the Western world,\r\nright on the spot, and have introduced the Chinese to a great many of\r\nthe best features of Western life. Finally, the Christians have\r\nembellished and justified Western imperialism in China. The mission\r\nenterprises have been among the most expensive and elaborate\r\nphilanthropic agencies ever set up by one state for the benefit of\r\nanother. The advance of the West has been saved from seeming unrelieved\r\nimperialism. The West has taken, but it has also returned. Christianity\r\nhas been the companion and the antagonist of Western exploitation in the\r\nEast; it has suffered and benefited because of this position.\r\n\r\nThe total contribution of Christianity to Chinese politics cannot be\r\nassessed. The ways of Christian influence are frequently pervasive and\r\nincalculable. In the headquarters of the Chinese Red Army, Chinese\r\nCommunist leaders have quietly gone away to pray. The Christians have\r\nbreached the Confucian citadel and have weakened the ideological\r\nfoundations of government. They have also torn the web of Chinese\r\npopular superstition and afforded a foothold for religion in a truer\r\nsense. There has been no genuine Christian party, no real Christian\r\narmy, no government avowedly Christian in policy. Nevertheless, the\r\nfirst president of the Republic was a Christian, as was the outstanding\r\nfounder of the National Government at Nanking, Chiang K'ai-shek. The\r\nProtestant Church counts among its members a large number of the highest\r\ngovernment personnel; no other religion plays as active a part.\r\nChristianity, then, has been an indirect force, not a program or an\r\nimmediate political challenge.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nationalism: Social-revolutionary Phase_\r\n\r\nIn 1912 the Nationalists had won their revolution, which was political\r\nin nature, but they found in the ensuing years that mere change in the\r\nform of government would not of itself bring about the needed\r\nregeneration of Chinese society. By 1922 Sun Yat-sen and his followers\r\npossessed a well-defined ideology and a definite new revolutionary\r\nprogram but they had neither a way of propagating the ideology nor a\r\nmethod of realizing the program. Sun himself thought in political and\r\neconomic rather than agitational terms. He sought loans from abroad and\r\nschemed for power in the turbulent military politics of the time. His\r\nslogan was still that of the Confucians: \"Hold office in order to\r\nteach.\" The Nationalists intended to gain a political rostrum from which\r\nto expound their teachings, since they no longer hoped to rule\r\neffectively without converting the masses to their way of thought. They\r\nhad not yet realized that conversion scarcely required governing and\r\nthat--given the appropriate technique--they might agitate more\r\nsuccessfully as an opposition than as a government.\r\n\r\nThe means of systematically winning men's minds--wholesale and\r\nhigh-speed agitation--did not occur to the Nationalists because the\r\nBolshevist revolution was the only successful demonstration of such\r\nmethods, and Russia was not yet understood. China was just reaching that\r\nphase of revolution which the Communists had already traversed in\r\nRussia. Without the benefit of Russian advice, the Kuomintang might have\r\nbecome a political sect with long-range plans. Fortunately for their\r\ncause, the Kuomintang leaders were willing to learn and the Russians\r\nwilling to teach. Mere physical contact served to inaugurate the\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nContact was not afforded by way of the Communist Party of China, a small\r\nand largely academic group which developed after 1920, but through\r\ndirect correspondence and negotiation between Sun Yat-sen and Moscow.\r\nSun had communicated with persons of influence all over the world,\r\ntrying to build up interest in the future of a united and powerful\r\nChina. He had conceived a plan for the international development of\r\nChina which envisaged the extension of Allied war budgets for one year\r\nafter the war, and the lending of vast sums for the modernization of\r\nChina. He believed that his project would appeal to imperialism and at\r\nthe same time would serve to create in China a modern state-socialist\r\nindustrialism. China would thereby become a customer for all the\r\ncapitalist nations of the world and alleviate the depression which was\r\nbound to follow the war. Correspondence about other projects for\r\nideological and political reconstruction elicited more replies from\r\nRussia than from anywhere else. Sun was not doctrinaire in the\r\nfurtherance of immediate projects. He was willing to accept help from\r\nthe Russians, just as he would have accepted help from the imperialist\r\nnations had they been prepared to risk their money. From 1920 onward he\r\nwas in touch with the Bolsheviks.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1922, and January, 1923, the decisive turning point was\r\nreached. Adolf Joffe, the Soviet representative in China, had come to\r\nShanghai and conferred with Sun Yat-sen. These two found that there were\r\nterms on which they could cooperate. The Communist ideology and that of\r\nthe Nationalists coincided in their general opposition to imperialism.\r\nResistance to the treaties which bound China[13] became more and more\r\napparent to Sun as a necessity for further revolutionary progress. He\r\nhad met polite regret or open ridicule in his solicitation of help for\r\nChina from the imperialist powers, and his invitation to Western capital\r\nhad not been taken seriously. The Communists seemed to have adequate\r\nidealistic and practical motives for joining the Chinese.\r\n\r\nThe Communists, moreover, conceded a point which they had not conceded\r\nto any other country up to that time. They willingly assumed a secondary\r\nposition, agreed that the communist order of things was not suited to\r\nChina, and in effect guaranteed their practical assistance to the\r\nNationalists without demanding, as the price, the acceptance of Marxism.\r\nSun and Joffe gave out a joint memorandum which made the issue perfectly\r\nplain. It was to be the constitutional compact between the Nationalists\r\nand the Communists for the period of their collaboration. The most\r\nsignificant paragraph read:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Sun Yat-sen holds that the communistic order, or even the Soviet\r\n  system, cannot actually be introduced into China because there do not\r\n  exist the conditions for the successful establishment of either\r\n  communism or Sovietism. This view is entirely shared by Mr. Joffe, who\r\n  is further of the opinion that China's paramount and most pressing\r\n  problem is to achieve national unification and attain full national\r\n  independence; and regarding this great task he has assured Dr. Sun\r\n  Yat-sen that China has the warmest sympathy of the Russian people and\r\n  can count on the support of Russia.[14]\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1923 Chiang K'ai-shek was sent by Sun to Russia to\r\nstudy the Soviet military system. This was the first step in the\r\nformation of a non-mercenary Nationalist army. About the same time\r\nMichael Borodin arrived in Canton, where Sun had come to power for the\r\nthird time. The ensuing period was marked by an intensive reorganization\r\nof the Nationalist Party and of its technique of revolution, to the end\r\nthat it might become a movement depending upon mass conversion, not upon\r\nmass apathy, for power. The military mission was followed by other and\r\nmore important grants of aid. The Bolsheviks not only trained Chinese\r\nsent to Russia but also supplied military instructors who reorganized\r\nthe Nationalist forces on the spot.[15]\r\n\r\nThe assistance rendered by the Soviets in the application of tested\r\npropaganda methods to a revolutionary situation resulted in vast\r\nchanges. The Russians found that approximately the same devices could be\r\nused in China as in Russia without affecting the fundamentals of\r\nNationalist philosophy. Integration and regularization of the party\r\nmachinery, formulation of immediate programs to bring large groups into\r\nthe Nationalist fold, development of large-scale propaganda techniques,\r\nand other improvements designed to enlarge and speed up the Nationalist\r\nadvance were effected within the Kuomintang.\r\n\r\nThroughout, Sun Yat-sen worked in close collaboration with Borodin. The\r\ndetails of Nationalist party reforms and of Nationalist participation in\r\nlocal politics are now part of the history of the modern Far East. These\r\ndetails, while significant, tend to blur the cardinal change: the\r\ntransformation of the Nationalist party from a revolutionary elite with\r\nlong-range effectiveness into a mass organization designed for\r\npropaganda and immediate general measures. The Russian Communists made\r\nit possible for the Kuomintang to perform in weeks what had been planned\r\nfor the decades, or at least to reach the equivalent of the contemplated\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\nA new era had begun. At first the Nationalists had proposed to develop a\r\nparliamentary government which would gradually foster a modernized\r\nideology, and to govern China well in the meanwhile; when this hope\r\nvanished with the rise of Yüan Shih-k'ai's military power, in 1913, they\r\nhad to reroute the revolution. Had they relied upon the experience of\r\nthe liberal nations, they might have resigned themselves to a policy of\r\ngradualism. The Communist process of conversion was different from the\r\nConfucian. The Confucians had gradually built up a body of the most\r\npublic-spirited men and permeated the ruling intellectual class with\r\nConfucian ideas. Their slow process of persuasion triumphed with the\r\nelevation of their main texts to the status of bibles in China and with\r\ntheir monopoly of advanced education. The Communists proposed to take a\r\nfew simple, obvious issues, to present them dramatically, to win as many\r\npeople as possible to the support of immediate policies and to reach\r\npower through such support. Once political and military authority had\r\nbeen established, they expected to go further in the \"education\" of the\r\nmasses of the people.\r\n\r\nTo obtain tangible results quickly the Nationalists had to make\r\nextensive promises. On the advice of the Communists, they led vigorous\r\nanti-imperialist movements which embittered both Chinese and foreigners\r\nand provided the whole country with issues more real than the\r\npersonalities of war lords or the machinations of cliques.\r\nCommunist-trained propagandists took the reforms which the Nationalists\r\nhad proposed among themselves and carried them into the people. Sun's\r\nprinciple of _min shêng_ appeared in practical programs as an immediate\r\ncall for socio-economic revolution. Mass organizations grew, swelling\r\ntheir ranks by promises to all subordinate economic groups. These\r\norganizations were bound to cause difficulty as soon as it became\r\napparent that the Nationalist-Communist promises could not be realized\r\nimmediately and in full.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the Communists maintained their separate party\r\norganization within the Kuomintang. The Russians found China a fertile\r\nfield for conversion, and while they assisted the Nationalists they\r\nfostered the growth of a Chinese Communist Party. From an academic group\r\nwhich meant nothing in 1921, the Communist Party grew in 1925-1926 to\r\ncomprise the radical vanguard of the revolution. The Communists assumed\r\nthe vanguard position because they were less bound by loyalty to the\r\nexisting groups in Chinese society than were the Nationalists. The\r\nworking alliance, in which the Nationalists received Communist help in\r\nmoney, technical political services, and arms, made the seizure of\r\npolitical power a reality. Sun Yat-sen died in March, 1925, before the\r\ngreat surge of the revolution came, but in 1926 and 1927 the\r\nNationalist-Communist forces proceeded north, brushing the militarists\r\naside as they went. The combination of a patriotic, foreign-trained,\r\nprofessionalized army, a powerful agitation department, and a party\r\norganization able to govern after conquest, came to prevail everywhere.\r\nHalf of China was now under Kuomintang dominion, which operated through\r\na council form of government.[16] Then came the schism. Conflict was\r\ninevitable between Communists and Nationalists when the Communists\r\nproved unwilling to look forward to the establishment of a republic\r\naccording to Sun's principles, pushing on with the revolution as soon as\r\nthe Nationalists slowed down or stopped.\r\n\r\nCommunist training helped the Nationalists to power, but under\r\ncircumstances which made necessary either the institution of terror or\r\nthe partial inhibition of the Nationalist programs. The Nationalists had\r\npromised almost anything to almost everyone in order to secure power;\r\nthis was a part of the propaganda methods which Communists taught. After\r\nseizing power in 1926-1927 the Nationalists could resort only to\r\nmilitary dictatorship and party terrorism in order to achieve the\r\nfulfillment of their extravagant promises. But the Nationalists were\r\nChinese, and as such cherished the old notions of moderation and\r\nhumanity in government. They were not the master of any legalism or\r\ndialectic which would justify the slaughter of millions for the good of\r\na system. Millions have died in China, but the Chinese never\r\nacknowledged the massacre. They could not face the program of class war\r\nwhich their promises inevitably implied. The Communists kept pressing\r\nforward, now giving pledges in their own name and in the name of the\r\nNationalists, redeemable only by class warfare or involving the\r\ndiscredit of the Nationalists. The situation came to a head when the\r\nCommunists began taking independent action. Indiscreet Communists\r\ninformed Nationalist leaders that the Kuomintang was to be discarded so\r\nthat the revolution could continue--along Communist lines. The breaks,\r\nfirst with the Kuomintang Right and then with the Kuomintang Left,\r\noccurred in 1927. The Russians went back to Russia. The Chinese\r\nCommunists faced their future alone.\r\n\r\nThe Canton-Moscow Entente--as the Nationalist-Communist coalition has\r\nbeen called--changed the Nationalist movement profoundly in 1923-1927.\r\nIt found the movement a small elite of opposition and left it a swollen\r\nparty with a government and an army under its control, a vast schedule\r\nof promises to fulfill, a second revolution to vindicate.[17]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] Sun Yat-sen, _How China Was Made a Republic_ (unpublished manuscript\r\nwritten in Shanghai in 1919, now in possession of the present author),\r\np. 4.\r\n\r\n[2] On the Manchu reforms see H.

After more than forty years\r\nof criticism and opposition, the movement had assumed the\r\nresponsibilities of government. In breaking with the Communists the\r\nNationalists lost the doctrinal edge of the extreme Left; thenceforth\r\nthere were to be groups more radical than themselves. This disheartened\r\nsome of the revolutionaries, who either lost interest in politics or\r\ncontinued revolutionary opposition to the regime their colleagues had\r\nformed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nationalism: Governing Phase_\r\n\r\nThe Kuomintang was confronted with the issues of national unification,\r\ndevelopment toward democracy, and realization of the economic reforms\r\nand programs postulated by Sun's principle, of _min shêng_. The\r\ninstrument for their task was a brand-new form of government, fresh\r\nfrom the pages of Sun Yat-sen, which at its birth was beset with\r\ndifficult military, administrative, economic, and diplomatic problems.\r\nBut the Nationalists had one particular advantage which they shared only\r\nwith the Communists--that of possessing a well-integrated ideology. It\r\nwas possible for them to couch intra-Party struggles in a reasonably\r\nconsistent set of terms. Even when respect for one of Sun Yat-sen's\r\ntheories had been reduced to mere lip service another from the same\r\nsource took its place. The intellectual outlook inherited from the\r\nhumanistic political training of Confucianism kept the Chinese from a\r\ndogmatic political pseudo-theology, while the wide circulation of Sun's\r\nprinciples provided a moral and programmatic foundation for governmental\r\nroutine.\r\n\r\nThe break with the Communists and the development of a Red military\r\nproblem were continuing forces driving the Nationalists to the Right,\r\nwhere opportunists and reactionaries of all categories welcomed them.\r\nThey were also drawn to the Left--by the social revolution which had\r\ncarried them to power and by the need of agrarian and labor reform.\r\nCentral to the very continuance of the government, however, was the\r\nmilitary power of the Nationalist armies led by Chiang K'ai-shek.\r\nWithout the armed force to implement their decisions the Nationalists\r\nwould have been compelled to let their endeavors subside into\r\nsubterranean defeat. To the considerations of Right, Left, and armed\r\nforce were added responsibilities incident to government. The Kuomintang\r\nin its governing phase, therefore, plotted its course with reference to\r\nthree points: doctrinal consistency, military necessity, governmental\r\nresponsibility.[1] As an ideologically constituent movement, how did\r\nNationalism use its power?\r\n\r\nThe Nationalists in power had to find their way through class\r\nalignments, inert and meaningless oppositions, the rancor of the Left,\r\nthe contempt of the established monarchist Right. Personalities in\r\nconflict, cliques forming and disbanding, factions denied overt\r\nexpression--these lay behind the pressure politics of the intra-Party\r\ncontest for the control of policy conducted on a thin and novel\r\nconstitutional plane. The written formulas guiding the struggle for\r\npower were supplemented by the bodies of unwritten practice which had\r\ndeveloped in the years of the Republic. There were appropriate forms for\r\nextraconstitutional action, just as for constitutional. It was the\r\noutstanding contribution of the Kuomintang to modern Chinese government\r\nthat it kept its internal conflicts within its own constitutional\r\nframework, and did so more successfully than any other movement in\r\nmodern China.\r\n\r\nThe meandering and difficult course of Kuomintang policy flowed within\r\nthe valley rather than the river bed of Sun Yat-sen's doctrine. The\r\nplanning power of Sun's intellect bound the movement long after his\r\ndeath. In his plans for the regeneration of China are to be found the\r\nideal requirements for the growth of modern government under the\r\ntutelage of a patriotic elite of overseas men, revolutionary veterans,\r\nand scholars. The Nanking government of the Kuomintang had to meet all\r\nthe problems of government while keeping within the broad boundaries of\r\nSun's demands. The movement as a whole, however, displayed certain broad\r\nshifts which are readily traceable.[2] Sun Yat-sen envisaged the\r\nestablishment of authentic democracy by a course of action including\r\nthree steps: (1) the military period, in which the movement should\r\nacquire power over the nation through the use of force; (2) the period\r\nof tutelage, in which the members of the movement should exercise a\r\nbenevolent party dictatorship over the nation, while training the\r\npopulace for democracy; (3) the period of constitutional democracy, in\r\nwhich the people should exercise actual self-government.\r\n\r\nShortly after its establishment, the National Government announced the\r\nending of the period of military conquest and the opening of the period\r\nof tutelage, which was set for 1930-1935. The Japanese invasions caused\r\nthe establishment of constitutional government to be postponed\r\nindefinitely, and it is to be feared that even if constitutional\r\ngovernment were installed it would fall far short of Sun's programs,\r\nwhich called for truly effective training in the arts of democracy\r\nbefore Chinese government could be entrusted to the broad masses of the\r\nelectorate. In the meantime, the arbitrariness, the political\r\ncomposition, and the outlook of the transitional Party dictatorship\r\nbecame subjects of hot controversy among the Kuomintang leaders.\r\n\r\nThe Party dictatorship demanded a rigor of discipline and a deflation of\r\nrevolutionary enthusiasm which soon drove the militant Left out of the\r\nKuomintang. Even Sun Yat-sen's brilliant young second wife remained\r\noutside the Party--a permanent and indefatigable opposition. Within the\r\nParty personalities came to dominate--Hu Han-min, the chief Rightist\r\ndisciple and interpreter of Sun Yat-sen; Chiang K'ai-shek, Sun's\r\noutstanding military protege; and Wang Ch'ing-wei, the chief Leftist\r\ndisciple of the Leader. There were also Sun Fo (Sun K'ê), the only son\r\nof Sun Yat-sen, and other ranking Party members whose opinions ranged\r\nfrom philosophic anarchism (as in the case of Wu Chih-hui) to a\r\nprogressive business outlook not unlike Mr. Hoover's (as in the instance\r\nof T. V. Soong).\r\n\r\nThe National Government settled down with Chiang and Hu Han-min\r\n(military and Right) holding the leadership, which Wang Ch'ing-wei\r\ndecried as reactionary. In 1931 Chiang ousted Hu, in the course of a\r\nconflict over a proposed American silver loan and over constitutional\r\nquestions. Shortly thereafter Wang Ch'ing-wei assumed a place in the\r\ngovernment, after participating in an unsuccessful armed rebellion (the\r\n\"Nationalist Government\" in Peking, 1930-1931).\r\n\r\nThis might seem to indicate a swing from the Right to the Left within\r\nthe Party. Actually it was indicative of the growing practicality of the\r\nNationalist movement and its preoccupation with problems of installing\r\nthe form of government planned by Sun.[3] With the passage of time, the\r\nNationalists adopted three main lines of endeavor: (1) the suppression\r\nof the Communists at all cost, even that of temporary nonresistance to\r\nJapan; (2) the tendency to abandon revolutionary fervor for\r\nadministrative zeal, and to become governmental in spirit as well as\r\nform--a tendency illustrated most notably in the promotion of industry\r\nunder H. H. Kung, railways under Sun Fo, and finance under T. V. Soong;\r\n(3) a policy of emphasizing military power, which meant the rise to\r\neffective personal leadership of Chiang K'ai-shek. The development of a\r\nUnited Front policy in 1937 and the war with Japan led to the reversal\r\nof the first two policies and an enormous emphasis on the third. The\r\nNationalists again turned to patriotism on the mass level rather than\r\ngovernment action in a patriotically bureaucratic sphere. This latter\r\npolicy, although it may seem strangely nonrevolutionary, was actually a\r\npart of Sun's programs to which the Nationalists were bound.\r\n\r\nThe class theory held by Sun was based upon a distinction between power\r\nand competence. The people should have _power_ to determine the range of\r\ngovernment policy; they obviously did not have the _competence_.\r\nCompetence was confined to the intellectual leaders and the thinking\r\npeople of society (who were to form two classes) and could not be found\r\nin the vast majority of people untrained to contemplate political\r\nproblems. Accordingly, Sun's scheme of government assumed the continuity\r\nof a bureaucracy made up of men of competence, but subject to the\r\nperiodic check of the populace, which possessed the power.\r\n\r\nAnother of Sun's programs relates to the question: How can democracy be\r\nreconciled with ideological control? The Chinese had lived in a society\r\nso completely under the rule of common ideas that independent individual\r\nthinking had to be moderate, careful, and orthodox in appearance before\r\nit met with any welcome. The individual was not free to think freely;\r\nbut since most did not think freely, sensing no need for it, they were\r\nunconscious of control. A problem larger than that of individual freedom\r\nis raised by the question of ideological control, since the controlled\r\nindividual himself transmits control to his neighbors and his\r\ndependents. The ideology must be filtered, as it were, at some point.\r\nSun believed that democracy would effectuate the filtering, allowing\r\nlong-range revision from outside the bureaucracy. He expected that the\r\nbureaucracy of democratic China would rule well but would be subject to\r\ncontrol from a people not completely under its thumb. The ideology was\r\nto be officially fostered, but it was to be subject to the check of the\r\nelectorate. The Chinese were still to use orthodoxy as a tool of control\r\nand social pressure as the major instrument of constraint, but they were\r\nnot to be allowed to fall into a blind traditionalism which would\r\nisolate them.\r\n\r\nThe old ideology was to be adjusted and supplemented with Western\r\nscience, so that the new would be compounded of three things: old\r\nChinese social and political experience, old Chinese ethical knowledge,\r\nand modern scientific truth. With respect to Western science, the\r\nNationalists had to present few startling governmental innovations,\r\nsince the need for a knowledge of the physical and technical sciences\r\nwas widely recognized in China--not only by the Nationalists. That the\r\nWestern technology should serve to build the new China was obvious;\r\ntrade schools needed encouragement rather than initiation. As to the old\r\nChinese social and political experience, the Kuomintang stressed study\r\nof China's past. They attempted to mend the gap between the generation\r\nborn in the 1880's and that born in the 1910's by encouraging\r\nconcentration on the classical texts, reverently, but critically as\r\nwell. Archaeology has heightened interest of the Chinese in their past.\r\nAs a consequence, their sense of national value has deepened.\r\n\r\nFor the restoration of the old Chinese moral and ethical system the New\r\nLife movement, which has been fostered personally by Generalissimo\r\nChiang K'ai-shek, is of great importance. Its principles consist of a\r\nsimple restatement of the cardinal Confucian personal virtues,\r\ninterpreted to suit modern conditions. It has presumably been influenced\r\nby Protestant Christianity, and may be said to be a form of puritanism.\r\nAlthough the Nationalist movement has not been as successful in ten\r\nyears as was the Confucian in two hundred, it has at least created a\r\nstate pattern. A state in the full sense would require a type of\r\norganization so clear in its ideology that people would personify it\r\nwillingly, would accord it existence whether leaders and governments\r\nfell or not, and would be loyal to it and to those who claimed to wield\r\nits power.\r\n\r\nAmong negative influences running against the Nationalist ideology, the\r\nNationalist neo-militarism has stood forth. As in the other\r\nideologically integrated states of the world (Russia, Germany, Italy),\r\nthe army assumed especial importance because its type of law and order\r\nrequired no common understanding higher than the assent of idiots. An\r\narmy is the one institution where complete harmony of thought is a\r\nluxury and not a necessity, where simple agreement on rewards,\r\npunishments, and organization morale will hold the structure together.\r\nThe Nationalist armies, however, rose to a new position. Ideological\r\ncontrol was introduced; the literate armies fought best. But despite the\r\ncivilian and intellectual factors from outside, the mere force\r\nconcentrated in weapons was so great as to amount to a constant\r\ntemptation. Whenever the day's fortunes were inclement, the men in\r\ncommand tended to settle things with guns. In contrast with sheer\r\nideals, the Nationalists were strongly military; in contrast with their\r\npredecessors, the Nationalist generals showed respect for civilian\r\nauthority. The charge of Nationalist neo-militarism focused upon the\r\npersonal popularity of army leaders, especially that of Chiang\r\nK'ai-shek. It can be adjudicated only by history.\r\n\r\nThe Nationalist movement neared its most drastic ordeal in 1936. The\r\npredetermined period of tutelage as decreed was passing, while the\r\ninauguration of constitutional government had to be deferred. With the\r\napproaching abolition of the Party dictatorship the Nationalist leaders\r\nwere to demonstrate their consistency with their own ideals and\r\nprograms. The programs of Sun Yat-sen called for the abdication of the\r\npatriotic elite, and the requirement--coupled as it had been with the\r\nproclamation of definite time limits--placed the issue squarely before\r\nthe Kuomintang leadership. Were they to attempt the democratic\r\nexperiment in a nation patently unripe for it, or were they to disavow\r\nthe commands of their deceased and sainted Leader, and continue in\r\npower?\r\n\r\n\r\n_Independent Marxism in China_\r\n\r\nThe proponents of Marxism were welcomed into China as trusted friends.\r\nIn 1926 it was obvious to the whole world that China was definitely\r\nwithin the orbit of Marxism; in 1935 it was just as apparent that the\r\nMarxists faced a military doom, and that their forcible suppression\r\nmight mean the end of their political effectiveness. Never ruined beyond\r\nall hope of recovery and triumph, never successful beyond all danger of\r\ndisaster, the Marxists and their doctrines are the greatest uncertainty\r\nfacing China.\r\n\r\nSinologues, judging from past experience and impressed with the deep\r\ncontinuities and repetitions of Chinese history, may well argue that\r\nMarxism is another religious distributive cult such as periods of\r\nturmoil always produce in China. They can point to the rise and fall of\r\nthe Yellow Turbans in the third century A. D., when the two leaders--the\r\nDuke of Heaven and the Duke of Humanity--shook the great Han dynasty\r\ndown into everlasting ruin. Or they can refer to the T'ai-p'ing\r\nrebellion, which held a territory infinitely greater than that ever\r\noccupied by the Marxists, which impressed a fantastic but politically\r\noperative Christianity upon its followers, and which promised to do in\r\nSouth China what Brigham Young and the Mormons had done with the United\r\nOrder in Utah; but the T'ai-p'ing went down to an extinction so complete\r\nthat no living advocate of the cult practiced by millions seventy years\r\nago can be found today. Thus it would be no violation of the set\r\npatterns of Chinese history if the movement of Marxism were to rise to\r\nworld-dazzling splendor and then pass into utter oblivion. Yet Chinese\r\nhistory is no longer the only kind of history which holds weight for\r\nprecedent in China, and if the T'ai-p'ing rebellion is one example, the\r\nRussian Revolution is another. Bolshevism certainly has better chances\r\nof succeeding in China than it could have seemed to have--to anyone but\r\na fanatic--in the Russia of 1915.\r\n\r\nThe Marxian doctrines had already eaten well into Chinese territory\r\nbefore entering upon the Chinese scene proper. One of the less savory\r\nbequests which the tsarist regime left the Communists was the question\r\nof Outer Mongolia, a vast stretch of land under the admitted suzerainty\r\nbut beyond the real control of the Chinese. The area was used by White\r\nRussians as a base for operations, and--whether or not it accorded with\r\ntheir principles--the Red forces had to cross the frontier to pacify\r\nSiberia. Once in, they could not get out. It was essentially the sort of\r\nabsent-minded conquest which has contributed so much to the British\r\nEmpire: a strategic occupation leading inevitably to political\r\ndomination. The Russians compromised as well as they might, setting up\r\nan Outer Mongolian People's Republic and administering the area in the\r\nway which the world was to observe on a much grander scale in the case\r\nof the Japanese in Manchuria--through advisers.\r\n\r\nMarxism became a force in China through men and literature and money and\r\narms reaching China by the sea route, as have most Western things. Its\r\nposition reflected, however, the facts that Russia is China's greatest\r\nneighbor and that the Russo-Chinese land frontier is one of the longest\r\nin the world. China is much nearer to San Francisco, in terms of\r\nshipping costs and speed of connections, than it is to Leningrad, but\r\nthe appearance of closer proximity to the latter played a considerable\r\nrole. The Nationalist-Communist coalition[4] was the result of the\r\nimpact of Marxism from Russia upon China proper. The Communists entered\r\nas allies, not as leaders. The period of Nationalist-Communist\r\ncooperation lasted because the practical projects of the two\r\nrevolutionary parties lay in a common direction. The gradual shift in\r\nthe role of the Communists from advisers and allies to teachers and\r\nmasters led to the break between the two organizations.\r\n\r\nHow did this shift develop? From the Marxian standpoint it was the move\r\nof a party leadership which was bound by a true ideology, that of\r\ndialectic materialism. Whatever the ethics of broken individual pledges,\r\nthere is no question that the Communists were justified according to\r\ntheir own beliefs in abandoning the Nationalists when the Nationalists\r\nceased positive revolutionary action and began a Nationalist\r\nreconstitution. The Communists felt themselves bound to take up the\r\nstandards of the revolution and proceed against Nationalists as against\r\nothers. There was no room in the Marxian ideology for anything but the\r\nofficially approved Communist Party; there was no ground for conceding\r\nthat the Nationalists might be wise in calling a breathing spell.\r\n\r\nThe Kuomintang leaders, on the other hand, had every reason to feel\r\naggrieved at the Communists. The Communists had come to help the Chinese\r\nrevolutionaries in their struggle for national liberation and to bring\r\nabout a common front against imperialism in the Far East. When the\r\nrevolution of national liberation was more than half accomplished, the\r\nCommunists had increased their following to such an extent that they\r\nregarded the Nationalist alliance as a mere episode in the growth of\r\nMarxian power in China. Marxists had come to help the cause of Sun\r\nYat-sen; Marxism was spread to fight and undo it. The sobering shock of\r\na grasp on power sent the Nationalists into relative conservatism. An\r\neminent Chinese writer has suggested the change of mood:\r\n\r\n  Our imagination was fired, our enthusiasm was kindled; thousands of\r\n  young men have fled from home and school from the outermost provinces\r\n  to join the Nationalist forces; they have toiled and they have\r\n  sweated, and thousands have gladly laid down their lives on the altar\r\n  of Nationalism that their dream of a regenerated and redeemed China\r\n  might come true. But, alas!... The war has ended--so has all\r\n  idealism.[5]\r\n\r\nThe Soviet Communists, deprived of their opportunity to broadcast\r\npropaganda on a large scale, and unable to ride the back of the\r\nNationalist tiger any longer, found themselves on a defensive which\r\nseemed to be permanent. At the same time, the Marxists in China\r\nencountered difficulties in adjusting their ideology to the fact that\r\ntheir strength lay in elements which official Marxism discredited. They\r\nowed their existence to agrarian discontent and to their excellent\r\narmy--the shock troops, in many cases, of the former coalition. The\r\nleader of Chinese Marxism, Ch'en Tu-hsiu, broke the party wide open with\r\na schism; he believed in modernizing effort rather than orthodox Marxist\r\nsymbols. Other schisms from the Left produced Marxisms intent on\r\napplying the European technique to China's small proletariat,\r\nindifferent to the land question and eager to make an Asiatic revolution\r\nfrom the textbooks of European labor conflict. Such deviations were as\r\nunrealistic and sterile as Blanquism, against which the nineteenth\r\ncentury Marxists inveighed so heavily. Even so the official Communist\r\nParty withstood nine years of savage attack and persecution because\r\nnecessity forced the Reds to pursue a simple line of policy--survival.\r\nOut of the test of deadly experience the Chinese Communists evolved\r\nmeans of allying themselves with the discontented peasantry, and found\r\nthe point at which further social reform yielded diminishing returns in\r\npopular support. In relying on the people for practical help, instead of\r\ninvoking theoretically popular appeals, the Chinese Communists attained\r\na defensive strength which could easily be turned into an offensive.\r\n\r\nThe reorientation in attitude--the splitting off of both extremes, the\r\niron necessity for an immediate and effectual popularization of the\r\nParty among the peasantry, and the lessons derived from responding to\r\nactual conditions--enabled the Communists to establish a state in\r\nKiangsi in 1931: the Chinese Soviet Republic.[6] In 1935 and 1936 Chiang\r\nK'ai-shek began the most vigorous of his attacks, which led to the\r\nremoval of the Chinese Red Army some two thousand miles from South\r\nCentral to Northwest China--one of the most astonishing military feats\r\nof modern times. Some observers have suggested that Chiang had no\r\nintention of allowing the Communists to disappear altogether from the\r\nscene, as they provided his military power with a _raison d'être_ in the\r\neyes of the Japanese. Had he run them utterly to ground, the Japanese\r\nmight have dispensed with him. Later events have made such an\r\nexplanation seem less persuasive, after the _coup d'état_ at Sian in\r\nDecember, 1936.\r\n\r\nThe personal factors and political events in this extraordinary drama\r\nare not yet known in their entirety, and it may be decades before the\r\nwhole story is pieced together from the accounts of eyewitnesses and\r\ninterpreters. Chiang K'ai-shek in his published diary mentions no formal\r\nagreement for the institution of a United Front policy, but the rumors\r\nfrom the Left persist in affirming the existence of a truce between the\r\nNationalists and the Communists, the fruits of which were to be action\r\nagainst Japan. Certainly the military and political effects of Chiang's\r\nkidnaping were substantial,[7] and the ideological scarcely less. In\r\nbrief, the kidnaping arose from action on the part of Chinese National\r\nArmy troops under the command of Chang Hsüeh-liang, the ex-_tuchün_ of\r\nManchuria. His forces were mostly from the Manchurian provinces and had\r\nno stomach for fighting the Communists in the far west of China while\r\nthe Japanese remained in undisturbed occupation of their homelands. They\r\nhad inaugurated an informal understanding with the Communists, and\r\nfraternization had begun between the opposing armies. When Chiang came\r\nup to investigate conditions, he was promptly kidnaped (December, 1936).\r\nHis bodyguard was slaughtered and he himself was injured in the spine.\r\nThe kidnaping was nominally the act of the _Tungpei_ (ex-Manchurian)\r\ntroops. Even the Communist forces worked for the release of Chiang,\r\nsince they felt that his death would mean national disaster. The release\r\nof Chiang was finally procured through the mediation of an Australian\r\neditor with a long experience in Chinese politics.[8]\r\n\r\nThe effect on popular thinking was twofold. In the first place, Chiang's\r\npopularity was made fully apparent by the vigor of the demonstrations in\r\nhis favor all over China. It had long been asserted that even the most\r\nmomentary relaxation of Chiang's despotism, as its opponents termed it,\r\nwould be followed either by anarchy or a new revolutionary regime.\r\nNeither appeared. The strength of the National Government as a\r\ngovernment was apparent, despite a strong odor of treason in widely\r\nseparated quarters, and the people as a whole kept quiet. Students,\r\nworkers, capitalists, officials, military men--all groups sought\r\nChiang's release. Their anxiety for his personal safety was in some\r\ncases qualified by a hearty dislike of the man himself, but almost\r\neveryone admitted to an admiration, either grudging or whole-hearted,\r\nfor the effectiveness of his work. The National Government and its chief\r\nmilitary leader were indeed strongly entrenched in popular sympathy and\r\nthought--more so than even the most optimistic observers had dared to\r\nhope.\r\n\r\nThe second consequence of the _coup d'état_ at Sian was even more\r\nimportant. The mere physical juxtaposition of the two leaderships,\r\nMarxian and Nationalist, and the probability that forced arbitration\r\nwould be the result of the kidnaping, led to a wild stimulation of\r\nhopes. At the same time it was generally realized that failure to come\r\nto terms might end in the murder of Chiang and in fateful results for\r\nall groups in China. The kidnapers demanded a United Front; the\r\nCommunists had issued a manifesto in behalf of it several months earlier\r\n(August 1, 1936). The problem was: could Chiang accede without ruining\r\nhis prestige or impairing the ideological position he had so laboriously\r\nbuilt up for himself?\r\n\r\nA compromise was found, which amounted to a paper victory for Chiang,\r\nnominal punishment of Chang and the other perpetrators of the kidnaping,\r\nceremonial apology to the nation by Chiang for having been kidnaped, and\r\na series of formally unrelated but probably linked events--all of which\r\nbrought the two ideologies and their adherents to a common ground.\r\nThroughout the following spring, progress was made in the negotiation of\r\na truce, which broadened into an armistice and ended as an alliance. On\r\nApril 30, 1937, for instance, the Young Communist Congress, composed of\r\nmen whose brains Chiang would have cheerfully blown out a few months\r\nbefore, elected Chiang and other Nationalist leaders to honorary\r\nmembership. On occasion, the Communists and the Nationalists exchanged\r\nclassical Chinese poems; each side sought to excel in sincere courtesy.\r\nThe armistice lasted through the period of the Japanese invasion in the\r\nsummer of 1937; formal union was achieved in September.[9]\r\n\r\nOn the political surface, the course of Marxism in China has been one of\r\nthe most startling developments in modern history. Alliance between\r\nHitler and Stalin would seem more plausible than the reunion of\r\nNationalist and Communist groups in China. To those in the service of\r\nthe Nanking regime in 1936, such an eventuality was the one thing\r\ncertain not to happen. The break between the Marxist and Nationalist\r\nleaderships and their subsequent reconciliation appeared, however, less\r\nimprobable in consideration of the course steered by the Communist world\r\nmovement during the decade 1927-1937. The United Front in China made it\r\npossible for the Chinese Communists to concede more than they would\r\notherwise have dared to except at the suggestion of the Russian and\r\ninternational Communists.\r\n\r\nThe future role of Marxism in China is still undecided. Nothing can be\r\nregarded as beyond the limit of probability, except the immediate\r\nestablishment of a permanent and unalterable regime. The challenges the\r\nMarxists raise are too important to be ignored--land and labor reform\r\nand the devising of workable techniques for distributive justice. If\r\nthey do not take control of the country themselves, they will at least\r\nbe a formidable factor for whoever does control the government. In the\r\nevent of foreign conquest the Marxians could provide an underground\r\nresistance of spectacular value. If the Chinese, applying terror and\r\nespionage against the Marxians then regarded as traitors, were not able\r\nto root them out in ten years of ferocious warfare, what will aliens\r\ndo--against Communists who have become patriots in the eyes of all the\r\npeople and who are assured help from all sides?\r\n\r\n\r\n_Japanese Efforts to Participate in Creating a New China_\r\n\r\nChina is Japan's greatest outside problem; she is only a secondary\r\nproblem in the foreign policies of the other great powers. Japan owes\r\nmuch to China in the way of borrowed ideas and institutions. Japan and\r\nSiam are the only free nations in the modern world which share with\r\nChina the background of a Chinese-dominated world society in the Far\r\nEast.[10] The Japanese resisted the extension of Chinese suzerainty to\r\ntheir islands, and on only one occasion did they concede formally that\r\nthe Chinese emperor was the head of all civilized society; this they\r\nbitterly regret. While the Siamese have maintained their independence,\r\nthey are in no position to take an active part in the creation of a new\r\nFar East, and the issue is between China and Japan, with the other\r\nPacific powers largely as spectators. The construction of a way of\r\nthinking to accommodate the men and territories no longer guided by the\r\nold order is a problem shared by Japan and China; the competition for\r\nimposing a feasible system is sharp. Japan wishes to create a new Far\r\nEast in which the Japanese shall constitute the most cultured core; the\r\nChinese take their ancient position for granted.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the ideational conflict for prestige between Chinese and\r\nJapanese, there is another realm wherein the two nations compete, using\r\nideas not as ends but as means. The extension of Western industry and\r\ntrade to the East produced acute dislocations both in China and in\r\nJapan, and in the case of Japan involved transforming the Japanese\r\nautarchy into a most dangerous dependence upon a share of the world\r\neconomy. Japan is truly a commercial and capitalist power; hers is no\r\nmere affectation of modernity. It is conceivable, should the West go\r\ndown to its Armageddon, that the Chinese might swing back to the ways of\r\ntheir past. The Japanese could not; their economic and political system\r\nhas expanded too far. They are inextricably bound up with the rest of\r\nthe industrial, capitalist modern world. In China the stock exchanges\r\nhave a mere toehold on the country; in Japan they have become the spine\r\nof national life. The Japanese must either pay the price of\r\nmodernization by accepting the lowly place of the latecomer or make up\r\ntheir tardiness in entering the imperialist scene by a veritable frenzy\r\nof expansion. Apart from the future of capitalism, there remains the\r\nquestion: Will Japan collapse before reaching imperial success in the\r\nworld economy?\r\n\r\nChina and the unpredictable but colossal Chinese markets are Japan's\r\ngoal, formulated after contact with the West. China and her unquestioned\r\ncultural prestige are the targets of the Japanese drive for the\r\nacquisition of standing, a campaign couched in indigenous Far Eastern\r\nterms. The conflict between the two countries weaves its way back and\r\nforth through elaborate and self-contradictory sets of terms. The\r\nJapanese have toyed with a multitude of policies for China. Some of\r\nthese are: (1) simple conquest; (2) the establishment of a peculiar Far\r\nEastern order under Japanese leadership--either in terms harmonious with\r\nWestern concepts of international affairs (the \"Japanese Monroe\r\nDoctrine\") or in terms derived from a modification of the past\r\n(\"Pan-Asia\"); (3) a common cause of Japanese and Chinese against the\r\nwhite peril, without any special emphasis on the relative positions of\r\nthe two countries; (4) a divine Japanese mission, not merely to save the\r\nyellow race but to rescue the whole world and put all nations under the\r\nprotecting benevolence of Japanese overlordship; (5) a strict policy of\r\nday-to-day opportunism--binding those parts of China accessible for such\r\nprocedure with treaties and agreements, and catching the Chinese as they\r\ncome forth into the arena of modern economic life; (6) expediency\r\ncouched in military terms, looking to absolute Japanese gains on the\r\nmap, regardless of the erection of a social system to perpetuate the\r\nimmediate military advances; (7) a pro-Chinese policy, to assure the\r\nJapanese a close ally (but in such a case a strong independent China\r\nwould inevitably excel Japan, and the Japanese would have to yield to\r\nChinese hegemony--however friendly--or else retreat from it into the\r\nisolation from which they emerged in the 1850's).\r\n\r\nDirect military conquest has a considerable appeal to the Japanese,\r\nexcept for its limitations. All the armies of the modern world would not\r\nbe enough to garrison and patrol a China desperately hostile through and\r\nthrough. The Chinese would not stop at suicide to embarrass their\r\nenemies, if there were complete ideological antagonism. The Japanese\r\nwould have to persuade the Chinese whom they conquered to remain alive,\r\nto keep working, to grow wealthy so that the conquest might not be\r\nwithout value. It is not possible to consider a policy involving the\r\noutright murder of from one hundred and fifty to two hundred million\r\npersons; short of such extermination, there is no way for the Japanese\r\nto clear the field for colonization in Chinese territories. If the\r\nJapanese cannot replace the Chinese, they must make use of them; to make\r\nuse of them, they must teach them to think in a way which will permit\r\nexploitation, for even the most inequitable exploitation involves some\r\ncooperation.\r\n\r\nEver since their peculiar Far Eastern order had been partially\r\nrecognized the Japanese began building up theories of a zone of\r\ninfluence to be based not upon law but upon geographic and racial fact.\r\nThe doctrines of Pan-Asia fitted their purpose. Writers in the different\r\nAsiatic countries had pointed out the desirability of a union of those\r\nAsiatic peoples which were not yet under colonial rule to prevent\r\nfurther occidental advance and to rescue their conquered neighbors. Sun\r\nYat-sen himself thought well of the Pan-Asia idea and stressed it, along\r\nwith the recommendation that all economically exploited powers confront\r\nthe exploiting powers--a class war between nations. As soon as the\r\nJapanese began turning to Pan-Asia for furtherance of their own peculiar\r\nends, these arguments lost much of their realism. The Japanese policies\r\ngenerated more disturbance in Asia than did the Western. Their call to\r\nprevent Western aggression, at a time when the Western powers were in\r\nretreat, sounded artificial. Nevertheless, the Pan-Asian movement forms\r\na link between ideology-conscious leaders in China and Japan; Japan's\r\nultra-patriotic Toyama had been friendly and helpful to Sun at the time\r\nwhen the former led the _Genyosha_ and the latter the _Hsing Chung\r\nHui_.[11] It was natural, however, that the Pan-Asian doctrine, although\r\nit never disappeared altogether in China, should be strongest in Japan.\r\nPan-Asia or its restricted form--Far-Easternism (_Toa-shugi_)--played a\r\nsignificant part in the military indoctrination in Japan, even though\r\nattempts to propagate it in China ended in almost complete failure.\r\n\r\nTo the ideological conquest of China the Japanese have contributed very\r\nlittle. Their theories, summed up, amount to but a drop in the sea of\r\ndoctrines. Only as the spokesman of China's ultra-reactionary\r\nmonarchists--who flourished twenty-five years ago--has Japan presented\r\nan ideological program which is other than derisible. Rich in the\r\nceremonial trappings of government, and in the personal elegance of its\r\npowerless ministers, the Great Manchou Empire makes a strong appeal to\r\nliterary persons with archaic tastes. Even there, the blunt modernism of\r\nthe Japanese military machine destroys the illusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Patriotism: The United Front_\r\n\r\n1937 was one of the most critical years of modern China. It marked a\r\nswift and startling grouping of the three active forces in China:\r\nNationalism, Communism, and Japanese compulsion. For ten years the\r\nNationalists and the Communists had waged a war of terror against each\r\nother; for six years a Chinese Soviet Republic had defied the National\r\nGovernment of China established at Nanking. Six years had passed since\r\nthe Japanese invasion of Manchuria, five since the establishment of a\r\nManchoukuo government. The Nationalists had hated the Japanese, but they\r\nhated the Communists more; at the humiliating price of non-resistance to\r\nJapan, Chiang K'ai-shek had brought the full military and agitational\r\npower of Nationalism to the suppression of the Marxians. The Japanese\r\nhad no great attachment to Chiang and the Nationalists and regarded\r\nNationalism itself as a force subversive to Japanese order in the Far\r\nEast. But they had tolerated the Kuomintang because it seemed a buffer\r\nbetween themselves and the Communists, and because they did not have the\r\npower or the immediate inclination to destroy the Nationalist regime.\r\n\r\nThis triangular deadlock was first broken by the kidnaping at Sian.\r\nNationalist and Communist leaderships were brought face to face, and\r\npreliminary terms were agreed upon. With each step toward a termination\r\nof the Nationalist-Communist wars the danger of a powerful China became\r\nmore striking to Japan, while simultaneously the Nanking regime became\r\nless valuable to the Japanese as a bulwark against Communism. The spring\r\nof 1937 marked the settlement with the Communists in the Northwest, the\r\ncontinuance of a general armistice, and the sharp improvement of\r\nNationalist prestige throughout the country. Circles which had been\r\nRightist recognized the increased military and financial power of the\r\nNationalists, now that the long and wasteful struggle with the\r\nCommunists was ended, releasing men, weapons, and money for application\r\nin other quarters. Leftist groups again found the Nanking state\r\nphilosophy palatable, and discovered in the official tenets of the\r\nNationalist Party enough common principles to justify the re-coalition\r\nof revolutionary forces. The radical intellectuals and students, who had\r\nswung sharply to the Left as a result of continued Nationalist yielding\r\nto Japan, turned again to Nationalist leadership.\r\n\r\nAs practical solutions to the Nationalist-Communist conflict were found,\r\nthe people in the larger cities were released from the governmental\r\nrestrictions which the Nationalists--upon Japanese insistence and threat\r\nof force--had placed on the expression of patriotic sentiments. A vast\r\nand vigorous patriotic feeling came suddenly to life, having grown more\r\nintense under the cramping inhibitions of police prohibition. The\r\npatriotism was revolutionary in mood but not wholly different from\r\nChinese patriotism of the past. The slogans all centered on national\r\ndefense. Release of political prisoners, cessation of internal war, and\r\ndemocratization of the government were regarded as steps to union and\r\ndefense.\r\n\r\nWhen the Japanese decided to push forward in earnest and began fighting\r\nin North China in the summer of 1937, the patriotic movement became so\r\npowerful that for the time it supplanted all other separate movements.\r\nOnly a number of aged or cynical opportunists remained outside. It was\r\nnow possible, under the slogan of a United Front of all China against\r\nJapan, to disregard the fundamental differences between the Nationalists\r\nand the Communists. A Chinese Communist wrote:\r\n\r\n  While we declare ourselves, despite the differences in principle that\r\n  exist between communism and Sun-Yat-sen-ism, advocates of the basic\r\n  revolutionary slogans of Sun Yat-sen, of the best revolutionary\r\n  traditions of the Chinese people, we Communists never for an instant\r\n  under any circumstances cease to be true followers of the\r\n  Marxist-Leninist teachings.[12]\r\n\r\nSuch utterances were matched by similar ones from the Nationalist side.\r\n\r\nIn their haste the Japanese utilized an ideology which they had\r\npracticed in Manchuria--literary Confucianism colored by notions adopted\r\nfrom the Japanese cult of the emperor. They also appealed to the\r\npractical and immediate needs of the Chinese living in the areas which\r\nthey conquered, setting up governments[13] to govern for them. But this\r\nwas hardly more than an expedient. Of far greater importance than even\r\nthe war itself is its long-range impact upon the Chinese mind.\r\n\r\nThe formulation of the present Chinese patriotic movement into a\r\ndefinite drive for the establishment of a new Chinese way of life may\r\nemerge as one of the lasting facts of the century. The various movements\r\nof the Republican era failed to disturb and arouse the masses\r\nsufficiently to make possible a replacement of the decrepit remnants of\r\nthe old Chinese social and intellectual world, or a reinterpretation\r\nadding the ingredients needed in a modern civilization. If patriotism\r\nunites the Chinese permanently, Japanese invasion may have provoked what\r\ntwenty-five years of Chinese effort could not bring about.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the Chinese have reacted to the emergencies of war in a\r\nmanner almost unprecedented among modern nations. War has not meant the\r\ncreation of a temporary despotism; it has brought democracy instead. The\r\nideological concord, the supremacy of a common national purpose, which\r\ncould not be achieved in a quarter century of peacetime agony, was\r\nbrought forth in the ordeal of national resistance. Democracy and not\r\ntyranny was the unifying force. The Kuomintang Party Congress, meeting\r\nin Hankow from March 29 to April 2, 1938, reaffirmed the primacy of the\r\n_San Min Chu I_, but at the same time guaranteed the sanctity of private\r\nrights, even in wartime, of groups who had been liable to official\r\nsuppression for years. The Communist press was flourishing openly in\r\nHankow, a testimony to the curious tolerance with which the Chinese\r\nunited for national defense. The governmental structure was increasingly\r\ndemocratized. Japan had provided a body of common assumptions strong\r\nenough to sustain democracy, despite the burden of mutually tolerated\r\ndisagreements.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] For the military aspects see below, pp. 108 ff.; for the immediate\r\ngovernmental aspects see below, pp. 167 ff.\r\n\r\n[2] The best account of the internal politics of the Kuomintang between\r\n1927 and 1933 is to be found in Gustav Amann, _Chiang Kaishek und die\r\nRegierung der Kuomintang in China_, Berlin and Heidelberg, 1936.\r\n\r\n[3] See below, pp. 172 ff.\r\n\r\n[4] See above, pp. 51 ff.\r\n\r\n[5] Lin Yutang, _Letters of a Chinese Amazon and War-Time Essays_, p.\r\nvi, Shanghai, 1930.\r\n\r\n[6] See below, pp. 182 ff.\r\n\r\n[7] See below, p. 184 ff.\r\n\r\n[8] On the Sian incident see General and Madame Chiang Kai-shek,\r\n_General Chiang Kai-shek_, Garden City, 1937; James M.

China\r\nis frequently interpreted in terms of personalities instead of mass\r\ninclinations, wide-filtering habits, and extensive relocations of\r\nthought. The picturesqueness of the Chinese leaders has done nothing to\r\nprevent the notion of many romantic autocracies from appearing real: the\r\nDog-Meat General, six feet tall, diabolically cruel and brazenly comic,\r\nwith his veritable zoological garden of ladies from all over the world;\r\nthe Christian General, burly, bluff, honest, Christian and Bolshevik,\r\nwith the happy naïveté of a feudal politician; the Bandit General and\r\nhis infatuation with fine arsenals; the Generalissimo, with his\r\nChristian wife, himself a Christian, rolling up a military machine\r\nagainst the third greatest naval power of the earth--such figures make\r\nChinese news a confused but exciting serial story.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Military Rule and Political Economy_\r\n\r\nFor long-range effects, the literary experiments of men like Hu Shih and\r\nthe mass-education drive of Dr. James Yen and his associates are more\r\nsignificant than any one of hundreds of military leaders, but long-range\r\ntrends are never news. The armies and their commanders have occupied the\r\ncenter of the stage, overshadowing the quest of the Chinese for civilian\r\nrule. Civilian rule, however, presupposes a sufficient area of common\r\nagreement on which to build laws and usages for government; armies\r\nrequire nothing but a nearly mechanical discipline and the crudest rule\r\nof thumb administration. The civilian government of Republican China has\r\nhad to await the coming of at least a minimum of order out of the\r\nturmoil; armies, for lack of government, have dominated and continued\r\nthat turmoil. China has been disunited in great part because she was\r\nimpoverished by military rule; she has been ruled by arms partly because\r\nshe was disunited. No unifier of the nation would have needed to\r\nmaintain the armed hordes which were the greatest impediment to real\r\nnational defense--hordes powerful enough to wreck governments but not\r\npowerful enough to build them. The war lords, as they are perhaps too\r\nflatteringly termed, do by no means measure up to the note of the\r\nintellectual and political leaders; but they have unquestionably held\r\nthe greater bulk of day-to-day authority in China since 1912.\r\n\r\nThe most significant function of the armies is one which is quite\r\nfrequently overlooked: their power as agencies of unsettlement. They\r\nhave created disturbances more profound than mere public disorder; they\r\nhave attacked institutions more vital than the public treasury; they\r\nhave kept all parts of China from the dull apathy of conservatism. The\r\narrogance and rapacity of the military rulers, their utter incompetence\r\nas administrators (with a number of honorable exceptions), and their\r\nineffectiveness as propagandists have provided that loose and haphazard\r\ntyranny which some philosophers consider the prime requisite for social\r\nferment. The military men have never been intelligent enough to impose\r\ntruly totalitarian regimes, nor efficient enough to make the people of\r\nany one area content with a permanent separatism. The presence of the\r\nmilitary rank and file has turned the Chinese social system upside down,\r\nreversing the accepted scale of ranks within the society and infringing\r\nupon the interests of every group--even the minimum interest of the very\r\npoor, their right not to starve to death. More conspicuously, the armies\r\nhave given a picture of power which, in contrast with the scarcely\r\ntraceable lines of influence and persuasion arising from ideological\r\nmovements, is intelligible and reducible to concrete terms.\r\n\r\nWithout the militarists, there would have been no visible series of\r\nevents to trace the change in China, no stereotypes at all by which to\r\nshow the immediate alterations on the scene of power. Many men did rise\r\nand fall regardless of military considerations, but such occurrences\r\nwere loosely and popularly ascribed to intrigue or else dismissed as\r\nbeyond all rational understanding. The armies subsisted and roamed\r\nabout, leaders and men both helpless on a sea of ignorance and doctrinal\r\nconflict; but the mere assent to unthinking discipline looked like\r\norder, and the most shadowy and insubstantial military hierarchy held\r\nout a promise of Caesarian peace. From 1915 to 1925 foreign comment\r\nstressed the movements of the war lords, singling out the man who might\r\nplay the role of a Chinese Napoleon, and to the present this simple\r\napproach satisfies many. Meanwhile the foundations of social life\r\nshifted, falling away here, growing more solid there, behind the gloomy\r\npanorama of brutal, ineffectual warfare.\r\n\r\nClosely related to the problem of armies was another category partially\r\nunderstandable in narrowly factual terms--political economy. The armies\r\nconditioned and set the pace, a slow one, for economic development. All\r\nfinancial projects were jeopardized by military rule, both by the\r\nexactions which the military might impose and by the constant threat\r\nthat militarists, devaluating the currency or arbitrarily changing the\r\npolitical controls of economy, might alter the very economic system in\r\nwhich the project was being considered and fostered. Economic life in\r\nChina could not continue through the traditional agricultural, guild,\r\nsemicapitalist devices; Western trade and social dislocation prevented\r\nthat. Yet no new economy could automatically replace the ruins of the\r\nold, since economic matters were part of a _political_ economy subject\r\nto the extra-economic interferences which ideological change, military\r\npower, and halfway government could impose. One of the truly important\r\nachievements of the National Government at Nanking was the creation of a\r\ncore for a twentieth century army. But all the military achievements in\r\nmodern China pale before the staggering surprise of a managed currency,\r\ndisplacing a commodity and specie system which was older than all modern\r\nwarfare.\r\n\r\nOne need not subscribe to either military or economic determinism to\r\nconcede the relevance of military and economic matters in any society.\r\nIn China there exists a peculiarly close correlation between the two.\r\nThe absence of a class founded squarely on economic privilege and the\r\nsubordination of the military to the bureaucratic elements in the\r\nimperial society were largely the result of the position occupied by the\r\naverage nonacademic Chinese, who was typically a farmer capable of being\r\na militiaman or a bandit. This duality of role strongly affected the\r\ndevelopment of government in China, and is a factor which still plays a\r\ngreat part. The Chinese owe many of their social and political\r\npeculiarities to the effectiveness of their mass action, which is able\r\nto take place with a minimum of formal leadership and coordination and\r\nwith a maximum of secrecy and totality. In times when foreign conquest\r\nof China is no longer in the realm of the improbable, it is worth\r\nremembering that the Chinese are a people adamant in resistance to force\r\nand schooled in centuries of rebellion. Neither pacific nor military\r\nresistance could take place in the traditional Chinese way without the\r\ndiffusion of military and economic power among broad masses of the\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nHow, it may be asked, have the Chinese succeeded in being such a\r\npeaceful people, and yet a people so prone to popular uprising? How is\r\nit that, with their great talents for organization, they have let a\r\nshabby third-rate militarism sweep their land in modern times? The\r\nChinese generals did not command the allegiance widely extended to even\r\nthe meanest of South American despots; yet the people trembled before\r\nthem. Not until the war lords lost power was there great popular\r\nenthusiasm for military ideals. If Chinese armies are considered solely\r\nas rough and primitive parallels to their European counterparts, paradox\r\nwill follow paradox without rational explanation. To understand the\r\nChinese military situation one must go back across the centuries and\r\ntrace a system and a tradition which, at times obscure and frequently\r\nsubmerged, must come to the surface in the decisions upon which rest the\r\nquestion of national life or death for China.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Downfall of the Charioteers_\r\n\r\nThe Chinese have differed from other peoples not in being peaceful so\r\nmuch as in extolling peace. Not even in the Christian tradition of peace\r\nand love are there condemnations of war stronger than those of the\r\nConfucians. Yet, century to century, the Chinese have known war against\r\nthe outside barbarians and with each other. Throughout historic times\r\nthere are records of struggle and slaughter. H. G. Creel writes, \"If we\r\nare to locate the traditional Chinese time of 'great peace' it must be\r\nfar back in the Neolithic stage. Experts agree that in the earlier of\r\nthe Neolithic sites known to us there is little evidence of warfare.\"[1]\r\n\r\nAt the very edge of history, about 1500 B. C., the Chinese appear as\r\naccomplished archers, using bows which were probably not dissimilar to\r\nthose in use down to the twentieth century--heavy reflex bows, with a\r\npull that was sometimes far greater than the longbow of the celebrated\r\nEnglish yeomen of medieval times. The pellet bow, a form of slingshot,\r\nwas also common in the earliest times. Armor was known in the earliest\r\nhistoric dynasty, the Shang, which by Chinese tradition is dated\r\n1765-1123 B. C. The chariot, however, seems to have been less widely\r\nused than it later came to be.[2]\r\n\r\nUnder the Chou dynasty, in all Chinese history the most caste-bound,\r\nmilitaristic, and feudal (traditionally dated 1122-256 B. C.), the\r\nimplements of warfare and the management of conflict fell into the hands\r\nof the ruling class. Previous to the Chou there was a relative military\r\nequality of all, despite the sharp lines between masters and men. After\r\nthe Chou the great military states culminating in the warrior-bureaucrat\r\ntyranny of the Ch'in Shih Huang Ti (third century B. C.) tended to\r\nreduce war to mass movements, in which establishments, management, and\r\nbroader considerations constantly increased. During this period the\r\nmaster class developed a scheme which was not as elaborately traced out\r\nin legal terms as Norman-English feudalism, nor as solidly grounded in\r\noutright military effectiveness as the Japanese system twenty-odd\r\ncenturies later, but which amounted to a chivalric order within the\r\nlimits of an ideology rooted in the family. The lords were the spiritual\r\nguardians and clan leaders as well as the earthly despots of their\r\nsubjects. Standing above the law and invested with positions of high\r\npolitical dignity, their class nearly became a caste. Warfare--as apart\r\nfrom slaughter--was formalized and ritualized beyond all Western dreams\r\nof gallantry. According to Marcel Granet, who has brilliantly described\r\npublic life of the period,\r\n\r\n  The battle is a confused mélée of boasts, generosities, homages,\r\n  insults, devotions, curses, blessings and sorceries. Much more than a\r\n  clash of arms, it is a duel of moral values, an encounter of competing\r\n  honours.... The battle is the great moment in which each warrior\r\n  proves his nobility, while in addition they prove to all present the\r\n  nobility of their prince, their cause and their country.[3]\r\n\r\nOur very word _chivalry_ suggests horsemen; the Chinese nobles ruled\r\ntheir elaborate realm not from horseback but from chariots. The\r\neducation of every patrician youth involved archery, music, writing, and\r\nreckoning, among other arts and virtues.[4] Archery was something which\r\nmight be learned, after a fashion, by large numbers of common men; even\r\npeasants, with a bow and a lance or pike, might constitute light cavalry\r\nwhen provided, or providing themselves, with mounts. But the use of the\r\nfour-horse chariot necessarily remained the exclusive privilege of the\r\nnobles. The chariot fighter had to have a driver and one or two others\r\nwith him in his vehicle, which was itself costly, hard to obtain, and\r\ndifficult to operate. A Chou noble driving forth to war thirty centuries\r\nago was as technical a unit as an aviator in a combat plane today or a\r\nsmall group of men in a tank. Just as there is a democracy implicit in\r\nthe light machine gun or the automatic rifle, so was there the\r\npotentiality of equality in vast masses of infantry, supported by light,\r\ncheaply armed cavalry. Aristocratic individualism meant something when\r\nwars were short and fought with elaborate equipment; but no noble could\r\nstand up against the mass forces which emerged and continued fighting\r\nuntil the feudal system lost any real significance and left the country\r\nopen to the development of bureaucratic government and military power.\r\n\r\nThere was no overt attack on the feudal system. The system, however,\r\npossessed within itself contradictions which led to its doom. The\r\ncentral power was insufficient to keep the peace, and certain local\r\ngroups were--by talent, economic factors, or geography--too strong to\r\nremain subordinate. The period known as the Spring and Autumn epoch\r\n(Ch'un Ch'iu; 770-473 B. C.) yielded to that known as the Age of Warring\r\nStates (Chan Kuo; 473-221 B. C.). From feudal cores there grew states,\r\nwhich began to follow the course of development that led to the\r\nappearance of a system of sovereign nations in Europe; they increasingly\r\ninterfered with the free operation of the feudal economy. By effecting\r\nthe massing of power they eliminated the overawing charioteer from the\r\nfield of decisive combat.[5] The chariots remained as the vehicles of\r\nthe leaders or the focal points of battles, but they no longer implied a\r\nskill so great as to make up a monopoly of first-rate military force.\r\nWhile the most eminent thinker of the age, Confucius, lamented the\r\ndecline of order, a new order was being shaped from the social,\r\neconomic, and military realities laid bare by rapid development,\r\nMachiavellian intrigue, and the hard necessities of wartime economies.\r\n\r\nThe state of Ch'in, a Chinese Prussia, attained overwhelming hegemony in\r\nthe third century before Christ. Its power rested on universal\r\nregistration of the inhabitants, conscription, heavy policing, taxation\r\ninvolving constant intervention in economic matters, and legalistic\r\nadministration. In its warfare there was little of the ritual which\r\ncharacterized the military period when chariots were dominant; codes did\r\nnot amount to much. The immediate end of war was slaughter for political\r\nand economic purposes, not the hazardous parade of a feudal class. The\r\nCh'in monarch who finally established a centralized empire took the\r\nvainglorious title of Shih Huang Ti (The First Emperor), and set himself\r\nthe task of eradicating the regionalist ideologies of his conquered\r\nrivals by suppressing all political history but that of his native\r\nstate. Proceeding from innovation to innovation, he ended by becoming\r\none of the historic figures detested by later epochs. One of the\r\npractices which he extended throughout the Empire of China was the\r\nregularization of military service. He is also known as the originator\r\nof the grandiose project of the Great Wall; it is less well known that\r\nhe forbade the erection of walls around cities within the Empire. His\r\nsystem of conscription involved three years of compulsory military\r\nservice for all young men, and a corvee of three days' service each year\r\nat the frontier for every citizen; the former came to depend for its\r\ninclusiveness upon administrative integrity, while the latter was soon\r\nreplaced by a money tax.\r\n\r\nAlthough the First Empire established by the Ch'in did not last long,\r\nthe Han dynasty (202 B. C. to A. D. 220) continued its military\r\nsystem[6] and kept standing armies at the northern frontier and at the\r\nimperial capital. The frontier forces were composed of militia augmented\r\nfor special campaigns by volunteers and criminals. The Chinese fought\r\nthe barbarians with the tactics of mounted archers, devices learned from\r\nthe nomads. Away from the northern steppes, infantry seems to have\r\ngained constantly in importance. By the time of Christ the chivalry of\r\nthe religious-social-military class of charioteers was ancient history,\r\nand mass armies had taken their place.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Military Elements in Chinese Imperial History_\r\n\r\nThrough the greater part of the past two thousand years, Chinese society\r\nhas been governed by civilians. The scholastic bureaucracy secured and\r\nkept a position of primacy, and a common ranking of the social classes\r\nwas: scholars, farmers, merchants, soldiers. The Confucians were\r\nantagonistic to war, and bureaucrats--if for governmental reasons\r\nalone--suspected the danger which lay in the broad dissemination of\r\nmilitary knowledge. The Chinese consistently ranked the military man\r\nbelow the civilian; as a natural consequence most of the abler men went\r\ninto scholarship and politics. Chinese history has its great military\r\nnames and ample accounts of spectacular military exploits, but even here\r\nthe elements of strategy, of diplomatic and cunning warfare, rate higher\r\nthan in the corresponding European histories. Despite the fact that arms\r\ndid not play as great a role in Chinese history as in Western, the\r\ndifference is one of degree only; military considerations appeared and\r\npersisted which colored governmental action and social organization.\r\nAmong these was the relation of the armed forces to the social order--in\r\npoint of numbers and in point of force. When elections are lacking in a\r\ncivilized society, fighting power demarcates an electorate of force, as\r\nit were; the distribution of power determines the center of political\r\ngravity as located in the society. In China there were, however,\r\nelements distinctly different from those in the West.\r\n\r\nOne of these was the correlation of mass power and military power. In\r\nepoch after epoch, armies seem to spring forth out of the very\r\nsoil--armed groups radically unlike the Roman legion. For seasoned\r\nveterans marching forth with elaborately effective disciplines China\r\nsubstituted mass forces drawn directly from the populace, as need arose.\r\nIn some dynasties the system was regularized in militia form. Of the\r\nHan, H. H. Dubs writes:\r\n\r\n  Chinese armies were largely militia. Everyone was compelled to serve\r\n  three years in the army or in forced labor; at the northern border,\r\n  the whole male population had constantly to be ready to repel Hun\r\n  forays. Hence all males seem to have been able to fight and to be\r\n  required to do so. When the Emperor Wu [ca. 120 B. C.] wanted armies\r\n  and none would volunteer, he merely had his officials sentence\r\n  criminals to army service--and thus secured armies which seemed to be\r\n  able to fight as successfully as his previous armies. Universal\r\n  military conscription plus a registration of all able-bodied males\r\n  seems to have been the Han method.[7]\r\n\r\nThe common people had crossbows for shooting birds or pronged hoes for\r\ndigging which were efficient even in fighting standing armies; they were\r\nalso frequently in possession of weapons because they were called up as\r\nmilitia against barbarians. Underlying such military conditions, with\r\ntheir highly important political consequences, there were several\r\nsurprisingly concrete and simple mechanical considerations. The\r\ncharioteers had come to an end partly because the chariots were drawn by\r\nhorses yoked in such a fashion that when the horses pulled hard, they\r\noften choked themselves. Other factors are suggested by Dubs:\r\n\r\n  By the time that horses became plentiful, so that cavalry was\r\n  employed, the crossbow had reached such a state of development that\r\n  cavalry was shown to be inferior to infantry with crossbows. The\r\n  medieval European crossbow was hampered by the mechanical weakness of\r\n  its trigger mechanism--the crossbow was likely to be discharged\r\n  prematurely by a jar; the Chinese Han crossbow had no such defect and\r\n  was a powerful weapon. A group of crossbowmen with others in the rear\r\n  to string crossbows and others to bring cocked bows to the marksmen in\r\n  the front rank, could shoot down cavalry before they could come near\r\n  enough to discharge the lighter bows cavalry necessarily carried.\r\n  Cocked crossbows could be carried around safely and fired when needed.\r\n  A bolt from a powerful crossbow could pierce any armor. Hence the\r\n  strong-backed peasant with a crossbow had an advantage over the noble\r\n  no matter how well the noble was armed or how good horses the latter\r\n  possessed. The only advantage retained by the noble was that of\r\n  leadership--tactical skill and command of large bodies of infantry.\r\n  Cavalry became useful for scouting and pursuit chiefly.[8]\r\n\r\nThe character of military techniques caused Chinese politics to be\r\nqualified by rebellion or the fear of rebellion. The difference between\r\na mob and an army became slight. In times of poor government there were\r\nrebellions almost yearly. Insurrectionary forces gained momentum\r\novernight; from era to era huge mobs, tens and hundreds of thousands\r\nstrong, swept away governmental armies and erased corrupt or oppressive\r\ndynasties. The process may be described as popular unrest made effective\r\nwith arms, which professional armies could not resist. The low place of\r\nthe soldier in society prevented men of genius from organizing a\r\ndominant military caste; the professional armies were insufficient to\r\nmake military government effective. By a crude and brutal democracy of\r\nmob and murder the populace of China could destroy dynasties and\r\ngovernments whenever economic, social, or political conditions veered\r\ntoo far beyond the limits of the tolerable.\r\n\r\nTrained fighters there were, but they had the function of frontier\r\ndefense; when civil war broke out behind them, the imperial governments\r\nfrequently called back the frontier forces together with the barbarians\r\nthey had been fighting. At least two great dynasties, the T'ang and the\r\nMing, were destroyed because they used the nomads of the northern wilds\r\nin order to put down domestic insurrections. Light cavalry supplemented\r\nenormous bodies of infantry. In fact, the Chinese were put down by\r\nforeign conquerors only when the foreigners had Chinese allies, or when\r\na campaign of terror had broken the spirit of popular resistance.\r\nChinese warfare showed the disadvantages as well as the advantages of\r\nbeing carried on by what were in effect militia forces. The cruelty was\r\npersonal and direct, and not covered with fine disclaimers; restraint of\r\narmed forces was the distinguished exception rather than the rule. The\r\nline between soldier and peasant was one which could be crossed easily,\r\nand the line between soldiery and banditry a matter of intention. At its\r\nbest, military technique was honest and robustly egalitarian; at its\r\nworst it led to abuse of force such as lynching, robbery, and fanatical\r\nturbulence. The formal records of Chinese dynasties show the use of\r\ntrained armies in foreign expeditions, in some of which they achieved\r\nfeats of military accomplishment which rank with any of world history.\r\nDomestic troops were also employed as guards and ornamental bodies\r\nattached to the throne and other great offices of the Empire.\r\n\r\nThe convenience of rebellion was such as to make revolt a part of the\r\nunwritten constitutional practice--that broad ideological framework upon\r\nwhich the Chinese world rested. It was sanctioned by the classics. It\r\nserved as a barometer of popular opinion. An unsuccessful rebellion, one\r\nwithout the dimmest chance of success, might well be launched by\r\nintelligent and patriotic men because its very appearance could prompt\r\nthe government to reform. In the words of one of the earliest Western\r\nwriters on the subject:\r\n\r\n  A military and police is maintained sufficient to crush merely\r\n  factious risings, but totally inadequate, both in numbers and in\r\n  nature, to put down a disgusted and indignant people. But though no\r\n  despotism, this same government is in form and machinery a pure\r\n  autocracy. In his district the magistrate is absolute; in his\r\n  province, the governor; in the empire, the Emperor. The Chinese people\r\n  have no right of legislation, they have no right of self-taxation,\r\n  they have not the power of voting out their rulers or of limiting or\r\n  stopping supplies. _They have therefore the right of rebellion._\r\n  Rebellion is in China the old, often exercised, legitimate, and\r\n  constitutional means of stopping arbitrary and vicious legislation and\r\n  administration.[9]\r\n\r\nThomas Taylor Meadows, the author just quoted, also noted that \"of all\r\nnations that have attained a certain degree of civilization, the Chinese\r\nare the least revolutionary and the most rebellious.\"[10] _Revolution_\r\nis a word broad enough to include principles; _rebellion_, more\r\nnarrowly, suggests action against men. The same tight, enduring system\r\nof ideological control served to restrain the Chinese in their thinking\r\neven when they had the material power sufficient to shake off their past\r\nand build Utopia in its place. Rebels themselves obeyed the unwritten\r\nprecepts. The triumph of the civilians was complete: with infantry\r\nprevailing on the battlefield, the peasants were the strongest; and with\r\nthe total population saturated in compelling, uniform ideas of right and\r\nwrong, appropriate and inappropriate, the scholars had only to await the\r\nestablishment of administration to assume the leadership. Against\r\nmalgovernment, the populace retained the power of rebellion. Against\r\nmisrule, the scholars held the power which came to them as interpreters\r\nof a vast and persuasive code of tradition. Whereas Western courts,\r\nciting the past, can negate the acts of the executive or legislative by\r\ninterpretation or annulment, the Chinese scholars would do the same not\r\nmerely for law, but for manners, morals, thoughts, and social activities\r\nas well. The great peasant armies, though able to destroy military\r\ndictatorship, were by their very nature too loosely organized to\r\nestablish it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Military Organization of the Manchu Dynasty_\r\n\r\nAlthough the Manchus, who conquered China in the first half of the\r\nseventeenth century and ruled it until the opening of the twentieth, did\r\nnot profoundly modify Chinese culture, they affected the military\r\nscheme. The general outline of Chinese war and its place in society\r\nremained largely the same; but there were two innovations: the\r\nestablishment of a warrior caste and the introduction of military\r\ntechniques from the West.\r\n\r\nThe Manchus were a non-Chinese people living in the northeastern\r\nperipheral zone of Chinese civilization. They had adopted the Chinese\r\nform of empire and bureaucracy in their capital at Mukden in the early\r\nseventeenth century, before advancing toward China proper. Invited by\r\nthe Chinese to lend their aid in a civil war, the Manchus found\r\nthemselves excelling in effectiveness and leadership, which soon led\r\nthem to conquer the whole country. The numerical disproportion between\r\nChinese and Manchus was such that the conquerors would never have taken\r\nover the Empire and founded a new dynasty (the Ch'ing) had they not been\r\nassisted by large numbers of Chinese. On the other hand, the spectacular\r\nterrorism of the Manchu cavalry was a potent weapon, and the Manchus did\r\nnot feel that they owed their throne entirely to the Chinese. They were\r\nin the anomalous position of half-conquerors, a people coming into China\r\npartly as aliens and partly as the new leaders of the Chinese. At the\r\nvery beginning of their rule (commonly dated 1644) they had to decide on\r\na policy to determine their relations with the Chinese: Should they\r\nallow their people to mingle with and disappear into the vast Chinese\r\nmasses, or should they attempt a policy of racial separateness to keep\r\ntheir blood clear of Chinese dilution? Underlying this question there\r\nwas the even more practical one: Should the Manchus rule China simply as\r\nanother imperial house, or should they attempt to maintain their status\r\nas a racially separate caste of conquerors?\r\n\r\nThere is a Chinese legend which tells of a high minister of state, a\r\nChinese in the service of the Manchu conquerors, who saw no remedy from\r\nthe oppression of China in his own generation, but who nevertheless\r\nworked with craftily concealed patriotism to sow the undoing of the\r\nhouse of the Ch'ing. He recommended to the Manchus that they keep their\r\nfighting men from demoralization by ordaining that no Manchu warrior\r\nshould enter any trade or profession but those of warfare and public\r\nadministration, and that they should guard the ancient heritage of their\r\nvaliant blood by making miscegenation a crime. Thus he schemed to\r\nstiffen the Manchu monarchy in a position of unbounded arrogance, so\r\nthat a few generations of peace would find its armies sloven, atrophied,\r\nand useless, and its people still alien to the Chinese. With neither\r\nmilitary power to overawe the masses nor popular affection to uphold\r\ntheir foreign-rooted dynasty, they were bound to go down; all this, the\r\nlegend tells, the Chinese adviser who lived and died with high Manchu\r\nhonors clearly foresaw. Actually the Manchus did move in such a\r\ndirection, and with the prophesied results.\r\n\r\nThey had conquered China with their own tribal-military system intact,\r\norganized into units termed _banners_. Unable to hold the country by\r\ntheir own force alone and, after putting down serious rebellions,\r\nunwilling to depend on the Chinese, they arranged a method of dual\r\ngarrisoning. A Manchu military hierarchy paralleled the Chinese\r\nbureaucracy throughout the Empire, and Manchu bannermen were placed in\r\nevery city of strategic importance. The Manchu garrisons were made up of\r\nmen destined to arms, men who were the descendants of the wild horsemen\r\nof the northeastern plains, but who soon became tragic and useless\r\nidlers. Forbidden entrance into the vast and vital civilian society of\r\nthe Chinese, by a decree of their own kinsman on the throne, they spent\r\ngeneration after generation in profound peace, forgetting war and losing\r\ntheir self-respect as warriors. Whatever the reason, they did not engage\r\nin practices such as the extended hunts, amounting in fact to great army\r\nmaneuvers, by which Kublai Khan kept his Mongol troops hard and ready\r\nfor war. An English writer, familiar with the state of the Manchu\r\ngarrisons in their last years, thus described them:\r\n\r\n  But, unhappily, the inactive bannermen, both at Peking and in the\r\n  provinces, had towards the end degenerated into idle, flabby, and too\r\n  often opium-smoking parasites; they had long neglected to keep up\r\n  their archery, which in any case had become useless in these days of\r\n  magazine rifles, though it might have nourished a wholesome muscular\r\n  habit of body if persisted in.... In the provinces these degenerate\r\n  Manchus were often, practically, honourable prisoners, rigidly\r\n  confined within the limits of the city walls, in the midst of a\r\n  semi-hostile population speaking a dialect which the bannermen ... had\r\n  to learn, ... if they wished even to buy a cabbage in the streets; and\r\n  the Tartar General, who nominally outranked even the Chinese Viceroy,\r\n  was really often a self-indulgent, ignorant incompetent.[11]\r\n\r\nPolitically, the Chinese found themselves face to face with a foreign\r\ngroup imbued with an arrogant racial pride and determined to maintain a\r\nseparate existence. The Manchus did not bend to the superior numbers of\r\nthe Chinese, nor yield to the attractions of Chinese culture. They\r\nmaintained the Manchu language at the innermost citadel of Chinese\r\ncivilization--the Forbidden City at Peking--and stamped their West\r\nAsiatic script on the money of the Empire. They worked out schemes by\r\nwhich the Manchus would retain a majority in the highest offices of the\r\nEmpire, on the sole ground of race. Elementary rationalizations of two\r\nopposing racial attitudes were the result. The Manchu policy fortified\r\nand brought back from the past the racial pride of the Chinese. They\r\nwere not merely the civilized heart of humanity; they were, civilization\r\nor no civilization, bound together by blood. If the Manchu garrisons\r\nserved no other purpose, the presence of alien troops in the cities\r\ntaught the Chinese the first lessons of resentment; it prepared them for\r\nthe vigorous racial-nationalist appeal which the Nationalists were to\r\nput forth.\r\n\r\nGovernmentally, the effect of Manchu dual government was to force the\r\nChinese to an increased consciousness of the implied presuppositions of\r\ntheir social and political system. The use of the garrisons constituted\r\none of the four main causes of Manchu decline; the second cause was the\r\nviolation of the strict merit system by racial preference in the\r\nbureaucracy; the other two were failure to maintain domestic\r\ntranquillity, and corruption in the hierarchy of scholar-officials.[12]\r\nManchu rule by military power was unrealistic and a political affront.\r\nTheir army of permanent occupation committed slow suicide in idleness\r\nand at the same time kept the Manchu dynasty from nativizing itself so\r\nthat the Chinese might think of it as Chinese. Their creation of a\r\nhierarchy of bannermen, paralleling the older Chinese civilian\r\ninstitutions, brought to the surface of thought those prejudices and\r\nassumptions which had guided and controlled Chinese destiny for\r\ncenturies. Government and society had been one to such a degree that the\r\nspecial features of a universal control did not require legalization or\r\nsharp tracing. The Manchus removed government from the rest of society\r\nby staining it with militarism and racial preference; it became\r\nominously disparate and a conspicuous target for examination and\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nIn the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries Manchu rule brought into a\r\nsharper focus the largely unformulated constitutional theory which had\r\nunderlain the Chinese imperial society for nearly twenty centuries. With\r\nthe sharper demarcation of rulers and ruled, the Manchus had to make\r\nfrequent and overt use of legal authority over the ideology. The Chinese\r\nread of the sanction of rebellion in their own classics; they could turn\r\nto their histories for a description of the ignoble origins of their\r\npresent masters. The dynasty turned therefore to literary censorship and\r\nordered extensive excisions from all writings scholarly, artistic, or\r\nother, which might weaken the prestige of their house.[13] They ordained\r\na most rigid and dogmatic interpretation of the classics so as to suit\r\ntheir purposes. This the Chinese met with sharp criticism. The literary\r\nstruggle did much to weaken the scholastic class and to deprive the\r\nManchus of academic supporters. At the same time it deprived the peasant\r\nChinese of their natural leaders, with the consequence that secret and\r\nhalf-literate political associations faced an arbitrary government\r\nmilitary in character. The old Chinese system remained, but it became\r\nmore and more of a form with every generation. The theory of moral\r\nagency and ideological control was defamed by the very presence of the\r\nbarbarian garrisons. The barbarians themselves weakened so much that in\r\nthe later days of the Manchu Empire the military occupation became a\r\nmyth instead of being a political fact. For the time being, however,\r\nManchu military organization acted as a force-displaying agency until\r\nthe scholars and the less favored classes of society were able to\r\ncombine in a revolution.\r\n\r\nPacific government, government by moral agency, derives its greatest\r\npowers from assent and agreement; it thrives on symbolization and is\r\nnever necessarily dependent upon the display of outright force.\r\nGovernment by force, on the other hand, remains effective almost in\r\nproportion to the exercise and vigor of that force; stereotyped and\r\nritualized, it is essentially weak. Purely ceremonial administration and\r\noffices may be a burden on the body politic, yet their dignity may make\r\nup for their lack of efficiency. But an army that cannot fight is an\r\nobject of ridicule, and its very presence a challenge to the resources\r\nof intelligence.\r\n\r\nThe Manchu garrisons in the key cities were under the command of Manchu\r\nmilitary officers, whom Europeans dubbed with the picturesque title of\r\n_Tartar Generals_. The garrisons were made up of three racial elements:\r\nManchu, Mongol, and Chinese. The Chinese in the banner armies were the\r\ndescendants of soldiers in the renegade Han army (_han chün_), the\r\nChinese section of the Manchu-Mongol-Chinese formations which conquered\r\nChina for the Manchus in the seventeenth century. The military\r\norganization seems to have been a simplified copy of civilian\r\nbureaucracy, with examiners, censors, and other familiar devices of\r\nChinese government appearing in quasi-military form. The principle of\r\nmerit was violated, however, in that certain categories of men claimed\r\nspecial rank by hereditary right.[14] It was also possible for some of\r\nthe bannermen to transfer between the civilian and the military branches\r\nof the government.\r\n\r\nIn the early nineteenth century the _han chün_ possessed considerable\r\nartillery. There was a separate navy, comprising more than two thousand\r\nwar vessels equipped from a score of dockyards. Even then, Chinese\r\nmilitary technology was markedly inferior to European; the Chinese navy\r\nwas no match even for Europe's wooden warships. When ironclads entered\r\nFar Eastern waters and breech-loading cannon were employed, the\r\ndifference made Chinese naval and artillery establishments almost\r\nantiquarian in nature. With most of the banner forces of the Empire kept\r\nat Peking and the rest scattered over the country in the great cities,\r\nthe Manchu force was widely diffused. In practice their armies hardly\r\nexceeded a quarter of a million men; whatever the exact total, the\r\nmilitary were outnumbered far over a thousand to one by the Chinese, in\r\nthe realm which the Manchus supposedly held by conquest.\r\n\r\nThe effective army in the later years of the Ch'ing dynasty was formed\r\nfor the most part of the Green Standard (_lü ying_), provincial\r\nregulars, and the vast hordes of irregulars (_yung_, or \"braves\") who\r\nhave traditionally done the greater share of the fighting in Chinese\r\nhistory. The Green Standard troops appear to have suffered, although to\r\na lesser degree, from the long peace which ruined the banner armies, but\r\ntheir use in major police enterprises and troubles with primitive\r\npeoples kept them from the utter demoralization of the banners. The\r\ncommon practice under the Ch'ing was to recruit the local toughs, to\r\nappoint their leaders as probationary officers, and to use such\r\nemergency armies for real and immediate fighting. Although the Manchu\r\ndynasty had no system of organized reserves and little machinery for\r\nrapid mobilization, they were thus nevertheless able to swell their\r\narmies to astonishing numbers in a very short while. American military\r\ncommentators said in 1900 that the peacetime size of the Chinese\r\nimperial army was about three hundred thousand men and its wartime\r\nstrength about one million--minute figures for China's reserve of man\r\npower--and added:\r\n\r\n  The total strength of the standing army of China can not be exactly\r\n  ascertained, and if a statement of the number of men belonging to it\r\n  could be given, it would be of little value, as many of the men who\r\n  are carried on the rolls are neither armed nor equipped, and a great\r\n  number of them are not even performing military service, but are\r\n  following their usual vocations.[15]\r\n\r\nThis military regime bears the air of a vast preparation for some\r\nforeseen but remote emergency. The Manchus themselves seemed to sleep;\r\narmies drowsed through the centuries, weapons rusting, tactics forgotten\r\nin the mimicry of parade, while all about them the factual potency of\r\nmilitary power passed to the Chinese. Even the Europeans at first shared\r\nthe illusion of great although latent military power behind the Manchu\r\nthrone. The easy defeat of the Manchu Chinese forces in the wars with\r\nEngland and France in the early and middle nineteenth century led\r\nwriters such as Thomas De Quincey to cry out against the great fraud of\r\nAsia--the sleeping Manchu giant, who was not sleeping but dead.\r\n\r\nThe T'ai-p'ing rebellion[16] lasting from 1849 to 1865 provided an\r\nactual test of military power in the Manchu Empire, and demonstrated two\r\nremarkable new facts. First, the real forces were no longer the regular\r\ntroops, whether banner or Green Standard, but the militia which might be\r\norganized and trained for immediate results by robust civilians like the\r\nviceroys Li Hung-chang and Tsêng Kuo-fan.[17] Second, the military\r\ntechnique of the Far East was obsolete; even a little Western equipment,\r\nleadership, and training made any Chinese army immediately more\r\neffective. The consequences were contradictory. If the military regime\r\nof the Manchus existed only in a formal sense, and actual power had\r\npassed to the Chinese masses, who had only to await a leadership to\r\nexhibit their power, then force had failed and government by moral\r\nagency would again be the need of the epoch. At the same time, the\r\nintroduction of Western technique showed the possibility of a new regime\r\nof force, another opportunity for a minority to overwhelm the vast\r\nmajority by sheer technical military effectiveness, and government by\r\nmoral agency could not be sufficient. The center of military gravity\r\nwould not simply pass to the group possessing the largest army. A new\r\nform of government, making intelligent use of modern weapons, was called\r\nfor.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly China was and is too large to be governed by mere military\r\noccupation--unless forces far larger than any which have heretofore\r\noperated in the Far East are employed. The very garrisoning of the\r\ncountry would absorb tremendous armies. At the same time, military force\r\nis sufficient to overawe and intimidate civilians in any given area,\r\nsince the man with a rifle is superior to the man with the crossbow or\r\nspear. Conceivably, however, a rhythm may originate between the progress\r\nin introducing new weapons and the progress of the populace in learning\r\nnew means of counteraction. In 1860 the British and French entered\r\nPeking and later burned the Summer Palace of the Manchu emperors as a\r\nlesson to the imperial government. The expedition, casual when measured\r\nby Western standards, showed that the Manchu bannermen and Chinese\r\nlevies were equally powerless before the intrusion of a more advanced\r\nskill in warfare. As soon as peace was declared the Chinese began\r\norganizing some of their metropolitan forces after the Western manner,\r\nobtaining foreign instructors to put them through the Western manual of\r\narms.\r\n\r\nAt the same time that the Manchu court was learning to its discomfort\r\nthe importance of Western warfare, it was calling Westerners to its aid\r\nin putting down the T'ai-p'ings. The Manchus assembled a nineteenth\r\ncentury navy including steam vessels from British and other sources,\r\nwhich broke up without having accomplished much. With land forces there\r\nwas much greater success; an American, Frederick Townsend Ward, and an\r\nEnglishman, Major Charles George (\"Chinese\") Gordon, organized a small\r\nbody of imperial regular troops along Western lines and with Western\r\nofficers. This force was given the honorific title of \"Ever Victorious\r\nArmy\" by the court, and together with the militia organized by Tsêng\r\nKuo-fan and Li Hung-chang suppressed the T'ai-p'ing rebellion after the\r\nbanner and Green Standard armies had failed.\r\n\r\nThe ensuing thirty years (1865-1895) witnessed the slow decline in\r\nManchu foreign policy and military development and a gradual crumbling\r\nof Chinese society at large. Revolutionaries such as Sun Yat-sen\r\nreceived their first baptism of Westernization in the 1870's and 1880's,\r\nand foreign trade rose by great leaps. Occasionally the Empire's\r\nmilitary regime seemed to rally. Between 1883 and 1885 the Chinese\r\nforces fighting the French in Indo-China were equipped with Mannlicher\r\nrifles far more up-to-date than the weapons of their enemies. In the\r\npreceding decade the Chinese destroyed a Mohammedan state set up in\r\nChinese Turkestan in defiance of their suzerainty, and overawed the\r\nRussians into evacuating an area along the Ili seized under the pretence\r\nof maintaining order. The lack of coordination between the different\r\nagencies of government was as much to blame for China's weakness as were\r\nthe specific defects of the central departments. When the army was\r\nwinning, the diplomatic agencies yielded; when the army was unprepared,\r\nthe diplomatic agencies, by some ill-timed impertinence, gave aliens the\r\npretext for hostilities.\r\n\r\nThe first Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895) offered another test. Hitherto,\r\nthe armed conflicts with Europeans, even including the entry of\r\nWesterners into Peking in 1860, had seemed remote from the actual\r\nproblem of military power in China. The Europeans might possibly\r\nwithdraw and leave the Empire in peace. But incalculable danger would\r\narise to Chinese prestige should the _wo_, the sea dwarfs, defeat the\r\nChinese and eat more deeply into the mainland. Chinese began to realize\r\nthat in this war their status was at stake, not only in the dimly\r\nperceived wide universe of the Westerners but also in that of the Far\r\nEast in which they had long held such comfortable hegemony. They entered\r\nthe war relatively well equipped, so that even outside observers were\r\ndoubtful of the outcome of the struggle. No one was more amazed than the\r\nChinese themselves when they were whipped as no modern nation has been\r\nwhipped, routed ignominiously in a sequence of slaughters, and\r\nultimately forced to make important territorial and financial\r\nconcessions to the Japanese.\r\n\r\nThis catastrophe was followed by a series of reforms, some designed to\r\nenable China to meet the West on its own ground. In January, 1896, a\r\nturning point was reached with the appointment of Yüan Shih-k'ai to\r\ncommand the one efficient brigade assembled in the course of the\r\nwar.[18] Yüan was to find in modern arms the career which led to his\r\ndictatorship after the fall of the Empire, and was to perform notable\r\nwork as a military and administrative reformer, although of restricted\r\nvalue. He joined the reactionaries and brought to an end the Hundred\r\nDays of Reform of 1898, a movement generated by the initiative of the\r\nidealistic young Emperor Kuang Hsü, who sought to direct China into the\r\ncourse already taken by Japan--modernization within the imperial system.\r\nIn 1900 there occurred the wild upheaval of the Boxers. It began as a\r\nnative racial uprising against the Manchus, but was deflected by the\r\nManchus into the support of the court and hostility against the Western\r\nintruders. During the Boxer movement part of the fighting against the\r\nWesterners was done by regular banner and Green Standard troops, but the\r\ngreater part by bands of desperadoes and fanatics. The imperial army\r\nsuffered in the chaos following the international occupation of Peking.\r\n\r\nUnder the name of the _Wu Wei Chün_ the first large-scale attempt was\r\nmade to modernize the Chinese armed forces. After the military and naval\r\nexperiments of the 1860's and later decades, this enterprise evoked\r\ngreat hopes. The new army was inaugurated in 1895 with foreign\r\ninstruction and foreign arms. In 1901 one division was made the core of\r\nYüan Shih-k'ai's new modern force. Rodney Gilbert, a British publicist,\r\nhas summarized the military changes down to the end of the Manchu\r\ndynasty as follows:\r\n\r\n  In January 1901 the Yangtze Viceroys submitted a memorial to the\r\n  Throne suggesting among other things the disbandment of the useless\r\n  _Lü Ying_ [Armies of the Green Standard], the employment of the\r\n  Bannermen, almost as useless, in service other than military, and the\r\n  creation of a modern army. This brought forth an Imperial decree\r\n  ordering reorganization of the army, of which Yuan Shih-kai, then\r\n  Viceroy of Chihli, took advantage to build up six new divisions, four\r\n  of which were transferred to the Ministry of War in 1906. This was\r\n  the real beginning of the _Lu Chun_, the Chinese National Army. In\r\n  January, 1905, a comprehensive scheme was outlined designed to give\r\n  China an army of 36 Divisions or 360,000 men, by the year 1911. Three\r\n  years after this decision was made there were about 60,000 men, with\r\n  360 guns, in the North, and 40,000 men, with 174 guns, in the South.\r\n  The army was developing along sound lines when Yuan Shih-kai was\r\n  removed from office in 1908 after the death of his great patroness\r\n  the Empress Dowager, and the direction of military, as well as\r\n  other affairs, fell into the hands of the Manchu princes, whose\r\n  mismanagement contributed much to the downfall of their dynasty three\r\n  years later.[19]\r\n\r\nThe beginning, although auspicious, did not mean that even the model\r\nsections of the modernized forces were comparable to those of other\r\nlands. The confusion of weapons was already evident. A member of the\r\nUnited States General Staff wrote in 1910:\r\n\r\n  To arm these masses China has been obliged to use weapons that are\r\n  considered somewhat out of date. There are four types of rifles,\r\n  mostly Mausers and Japanese Murata rifles of old pattern. They are,\r\n  however, breech-loading, small-caliber weapons, not to be despised,\r\n  even if they do not reach the ideal which some nations set. In fact\r\n  they are the weapons which have been used in the great wars of most\r\n  recent date.\r\n\r\n  It is so also with the artillery where even a greater difference of\r\n  types is to be observed. This is, undoubtedly, a serious drawback,\r\n  owing, of course, to the great difficulty of providing ammunition.[20]\r\n\r\nIt was during this period, from the decisive defeat of the dynasty by\r\nJapan in 1895 to the Republican Revolution of 1911-1912, that the\r\nChinese revolutionaries most eagerly studied military manuals and sought\r\nto purchase Western arms to offset the great advantages gained by the\r\nmodernized portions of the imperial army. Sun Yat-sen became almost as\r\nmuch a military authority as he was a political philosopher and leader;\r\nhis chief military follower, General Huang Hsing, performed for the\r\nrevolutionaries the services rendered for the regime by Yüan Shih-k'ai.\r\nOn both sides there was the anxiety to master the mysteries of twentieth\r\ncentury warfare. The World War had not yet begun, nor had the staggering\r\nburdens of modern armament become evident. Great as were the\r\nimprovements in fighting, prewar military organization seemed still\r\nprimarily a matter of well-equipped infantry, properly led, properly\r\ndrilled, and supported by adequate artillery and other auxiliary\r\nservices. Wireless, gas, airplanes, tanks, submarines, torpedo launches,\r\nand mechanized or aerialized infantry were little more than a matter of\r\nspeculation. The proportions of present-day military budgets no one\r\ncould foresee.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Army and the Republican Revolution_\r\n\r\nThe Republican Revolution of 1911-1912 was the last overt act in the\r\ncollapse of the ideologically maintained social system; it brought\r\narmies into violently free play in the support of movements toward\r\nre-formation of the ideology and articulation and control of the\r\nsociety. On October 10, 1911, the troops of the Wuch'ang garrison rose\r\nin mutiny and sided with the revolution. A series of uprisings\r\nengineered by military and agitational leaders followed, province by\r\nprovince, all directed against the imperial power in the North. The use\r\nof violence in Chinese politics served to accentuate a condition which\r\nhad affected China even in the earliest historic times--the unresolved\r\ncontradictions between the North and the South. Differences of race,\r\nspoken language, and economy produced fundamental cleavages accentuated\r\nby temperament. Traditionally the North was more conservative and\r\nsolidaristic, the South more rebellious and enterprising. Sun Yat-sen\r\nwas a Southerner; militarism reached its sharpest effectiveness in the\r\nNorth.\r\n\r\nYüan Shih-k'ai, who had proved himself the evil genius of Emperor Kuang\r\nHsü by betraying the monarch's reforms of 1898, was called to the aid of\r\nthe Manchus only to betray them to the Republic; he then served the\r\nRepublic with the intention of seizing complete power for himself. The\r\nRepublicans set up their regime in Nanking on January 1, 1912, with Sun\r\nYat-sen as president. They established contact with Yüan, who acted in\r\nthe triple capacity of negotiator for the Manchus, representative of the\r\nmodernized armies of the North (which were his), and leader in his own\r\nright and in his own interest. The Republicans realized that Yüan could\r\nnot be dispossessed--indeed, it is fairly certain that he could have\r\nupheld the throne had he so wished. Their power was indefinite, and as\r\nChinese they preferred compromise and order to ideals pushed to the\r\nbitter end. In the middle of February they yielded to Yüan, and Sun\r\nsurrendered to him the presidency as a reward for his allegiance to the\r\nRepublic. Yüan, for the Manchus, secured a settlement by which the\r\nForbidden City (the residence of the emperor in Peking) was made into a\r\nsecond Vatican City; the emperor was allowed his formal and ritual\r\ntitles (a status remarkably like that of the Pope) and a very\r\nsubstantial stipend. For the Northern armies and himself Yüan obtained\r\nactual power over the country. A civilian, but a soldier as well, Yüan\r\nrose by both intrigue and the implied threat of force.\r\n\r\nThe Republic was launched by valedictory imperial edicts ordering the\r\nimperial officials throughout the realm to obey Yüan and the new form of\r\ngovernment; by Republicans nominally headed by their greatest and\r\ncoldest antagonist; and by a soldier of higher professional standing in\r\nthe Western sense than any Chinese leader for centuries past undertaking\r\nthe task of keeping order and ushering China through drastic\r\nreconstruction. For a few halcyon months it seemed as though the\r\nRepublic might grow into reality from under the aegis of military\r\ndictatorship.[21] But soon it became apparent that the revolution was\r\nnot a transfer of power and renovation of order but the dissolution of\r\npower and the erasure of order. What was left was ideological\r\nuncertainty, social turmoil, economic disorganization--with politics\r\nreduced to mere pageantry, and the armies, ominously growing under the\r\ncare of President Yüan, maintaining what little order was left to\r\nmaintain. In 1913 the Nationalist-Republicans rebelled in the Yangtze\r\nvalley and were crushed by the armies of the government of the Republic\r\nof China.\r\n\r\nFrom the military rule of Yüan Shih-k'ai there emerged an army system\r\nwhich was to bring China to almost complete political ruin in the decade\r\nafter Yüan's death. Although he organized a model regiment as a sample\r\nof what could be done in China, inflation of numbers and deterioration\r\nof morale and _matériel_ were the most obvious symptoms of the new role\r\nof the army--a role much more concerned with problems of domestic\r\nintrigue than with defense against the outsiders. For an army of\r\nnational defense, high technical excellence and a commensurate smallness\r\nof numbers are desirable features; for an army of dictatorship or\r\noccupation, inferior equipment, poor supplies, and inefficient training\r\nare all trifling handicaps in comparison with the advantage of vast\r\nnumbers which can be used to garrison large sections of the realm and\r\nmeet the threat of civil war. The very shift from empire to republic\r\ninvolved the enlistment of additional thousands of revolutionary\r\nfighters; once in the army, they were hard to dislodge. The personal\r\nmilitary interests of Yüan led him to expand the army, and his political\r\nambitions nourished the thought that the country would be secure beneath\r\nhim only through the medium of an extensive garrison system. Finally,\r\nthere was a far-reaching shift in the Chinese social pyramid. Men of\r\nintelligence and of education flocked to the army, and Japan's military\r\nschools were crowded with young Chinese who saw in war their easiest\r\navenue to fortune or to the service of their country.\r\n\r\nA reconstituted army, soldiers who could command greater respect than\r\never before, numerical extension and qualitative deterioration of the\r\nnational armed forces--these were the more patent military changes under\r\nthe Republic. To them must be added the factors fusing the elements into\r\na system that was to bring immediate fortune and ultimate ruin to\r\npractically all who ventured into its operations. Many of the provinces\r\nwhich turned to the cause of the revolutionaries in 1911 and 1912 became\r\ngradually militarized. When the Manchus were gone, the old distinction\r\nbetween the Tartar General and the civilian viceroy had lost its\r\npurpose; the new provincial executives combined both military and\r\ngovernmental powers. Provincial jealousies and the growing disorder\r\nfavored a strong factual autonomy for the various provinces, even though\r\nthere was no technical claim of provincial independence and very little\r\neven of confederation. The first Republic was in name a centralized\r\nparliamentary-presidential state with quasi-federal features; in fact it\r\nwas the combination of an impotent, headless imperial bureaucracy and a\r\npresidential military dictatorship possessing physically limited and\r\nindefinable authority over a large group of provinces. Between China and\r\nthe accomplishment of regular and orderly republican government there\r\nstood ignorance, turmoil, poverty, reaction, and despair. Between Yüan's\r\nregime and the _tuchün_ system there stood only Yüan's might.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] Herrlee G.

Even so, he retained control of the country.[1] The\r\nhumiliation of his defeat lacked even dramatic compensations, and he\r\ndied in June, 1916, of disease, poison, or chagrin. With his death the\r\nRepublic had a chance to stand by itself, but it could not.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Age of the War Lords_\r\n\r\nYüan had fastened the symbols of old on the scaffolding of a new order.\r\nWith his death the momentum of administrative routine retained from the\r\nManchu dynasty was lost; the Republican government in Peking degenerated\r\nfrom impotence to comedy. The process called government began to\r\nnauseate patriotic Chinese and foreigners alike; few were able to take a\r\nlong view, to maintain their courage, and to keep on fighting against\r\ndisgusting and disheartening realities. With the decomposition of the\r\ncentral government--except the modern bureaucracies such as posts and\r\ncustoms, which were kept intact by their foreign personnel and their\r\nspecial international status--the armies, though divided provincially,\r\nstepped into positions of unprecedented authority. There was a veritable\r\nepidemic of monarchical ambition, greed, and willfulness among the\r\nprovincial military commanders; many Chinese expected a new Yüan to\r\nemerge from that group and become the \"strong man of China.\" With such a\r\nstage to strut on, it is not surprising that the Chinese military lost\r\nconstructive vision. A sober nucleus of idealistically hard-headed,\r\npatriotic men, each a George Washington, might have used military power\r\nto reunite the country, but order could not be expected to emerge from\r\nthe unsystematized competition of armed forces.\r\n\r\nThree broader factors affected the ascendancy of war lords, in addition\r\nto obvious motives and interests. The ideological ruin was bad enough;\r\nthe consequent social disorder crippled China. But the armies now came\r\nto provide a refuge for the unemployed and dispossessed. A second\r\nfactor, the mechanical mobilization of military forces through the\r\nrailways, made warfare more expensive and ruinous than it would have\r\nbeen with the slow-moving infantry of the past. Thirdly, the war lords\r\ngave physical embodiment to the ideological and social disunity of\r\nChina, inviting the constant intervention of the Western powers and of\r\nJapan in Chinese affairs.\r\n\r\nIndividually the war lords warrant no special attention. There was Chang\r\nTso-lin in Manchuria; Tuan Chi-jui and Ts'ao Kun in North China; Yen\r\nHsi-shan (\"The Model Governor\") and, to the west of him, Fêng Yü-hsiang\r\n(\"The Christian General\"); Chang Chung-chang in Shantung, significant\r\nmore for his brutality than for his political and military position; the\r\nquaint, conservative scholar Wu P'ei-fu, in the Yangtze valley, minor\r\nfigures in the South and West. It was not the generals who were\r\nimportant, but militarism.\r\n\r\nMilitarism machine-gunned the Confucian ethics out of politics; it taxed\r\nthe land into ruin; it laid China wide open to imperialistic thrusts,\r\nand--by the same act--made her a poor market. Militarism built roads\r\nwhen they were strategically required, established a few railways and\r\nspoiled more, modernized China, but did so in the costliest way of all.\r\nOnly in the intellectual world was military domination not outright\r\ndestruction. The generals and their staffs were surprisingly ignorant of\r\nthe power of ideas, ineffectual in their censorship, oblivious to the\r\ngreat leverage of undercover agitation. Trusting arms, they failed to\r\nsee that the only opposition able to destroy them was not military but\r\nmental.\r\n\r\nWhile the soldiery stirred the country with murder and oppression, their\r\nsystem progressed steadily toward self-destruction. Two great pressures\r\nforced constant further expansion of the armies. The first is obvious:\r\nmilitary rivalry. The second was the growing abuse of army organization\r\nas a means of unemployment relief. Military taxation drove the peasants\r\noff the land, whereupon they had no recourse but to become bandits or\r\nsoldiers. If they were bandits, consolidation under a chieftain\r\ntransformed them into military irregulars and induced some ambitious\r\ngeneral to include them in his forces. If they were soldiers, the bandit\r\nstage remained in reach. In either case, they added to the burden\r\nfalling upon their commander, which in turn led to still greater\r\nimpoverishment of the peasants, a further increase of dispossessed men,\r\nbandits, and soldiers. With the widening circulation of arms, Western\r\nguns and fighting methods became less and less a secret of small groups\r\ncapable of establishing a firm military oligarchy and more and more the\r\nproperty of a cross section of the Chinese masses.\r\n\r\nFrom an estimated total of 1,369,880 in 1921,[2] the number of men under\r\narms rose to a figure estimated to be between 1,883,300 and 1,933,300\r\nfive years later.[3] This increase occurred in one of the poorest\r\ncountries of the world, despite conditions of extreme misery:\r\n\r\n  Recruiting goes on incessantly in every town in North China where\r\n  there is a garrison. There are no statistics available, but it is\r\n  known that the death rate from disease is very high because, even in\r\n  garrison, sanitary precautions are crude and the medical service is\r\n  inefficient and inadequate. In battle the care of the wounded is\r\n  barbarously primitive, even in the best units, and death from infected\r\n  wounds is rather the rule than the exception; while those who cannot\r\n  walk from the field to the nearest hospital more often than not die of\r\n  exposure or clumsy handling. One of a Chinese commander's major\r\n  concerns is filling the gaps in the ranks, but at the same time these\r\n  conditions have kept the proportions of the armies down to a fairly\r\n  constant figure. Chinese officers have advanced the theory that if\r\n  recruiting were everywhere abandoned, disease, desertions and losses\r\n  in battle would account for ten per cent. per annum, so that the\r\n  armies would automatically cease to exist in ten years.[4]\r\n\r\nThe use of the railways for military purposes unsettled large groups of\r\nChinese geographically and caused meetings of extensive bodies of men\r\nfrom different areas. At first such contacts, especially under wartime\r\nconditions, would only intensify provincial sentiment and mistrust of\r\nstrangers, but gradually this influence began to make for a new national\r\nconsciousness. In the meantime, the troops learned the intricacies of\r\nmodern transport. A coolie in a peaceful part of Asia might see trains\r\nfor years, observing the Westerners riding in them, and remain impressed\r\nby the sight; a Chinese bandit sitting on a freight car in a\r\ncommandeered train would become rapidly familiar with the fire vehicles.\r\n\r\nThe role of the militarists with respect to China's international status\r\nwas ambiguous. In the first place, the weakness which they created\r\nreduced China to an international pawn. The discord into which she had\r\nfallen allowed for semipartitions--various foreign interests backing\r\ndifferent war lords--although a genuine partition may thereby have been\r\nstaved off. In China proper the influence of the Japanese seemed to be\r\nbehind Chang Tso-lin and the Northern militarists; the British were\r\nregarded as friendly to Wu P'ei-fu in the Yangtze valley; and the French\r\nachieved something not far from domination in the province farthest\r\nsouthwest, Yünnan. Fêng Yü-hsiang was supposed to have veered\r\npicturesquely for foreign friends between the Protestant missions and\r\nthe Bolshevik agents. A miniature replica of the European balance of\r\npower could be played in China, with outside groups friendly to one or\r\nthe other war lord. An agreement between the chief participants in 1919\r\nsought to prevent the shipping of arms to unauthorized military groups\r\nin China but proved largely ineffectual in the end.\r\n\r\nBetween 1922 and 1926 there was formed in South China a nexus of armies\r\nwhich were to provide the military edge to ideological revolution and\r\nestablish the followers of Sun Yat-sen in power. These armies were built\r\nup with the assistance of Russian and German advisers and with American\r\narms which had been left in Siberia and had fallen into the hands of the\r\nBolsheviks; the troops were led by new-style Chinese officers under the\r\nleadership of Chiang K'ai-shek. The Whampoa Academy was the most obvious\r\nsign of the new school of military thought, coming forth as a\r\nconsequence of the Nationalist-Communist coalition.[5] Armaments did not\r\ndiffer in any substantial degree from those of the war lords, but they\r\nwere more carefully kept and more skillfully used. The military machine\r\nwhich arose in the South was better organized, better disciplined,\r\nbetter led, and better cared for than any army on the Chinese scene for\r\na decade.\r\n\r\nFrom 1926 to 1927 the ensuing campaign for the Nationalist conquest of\r\nChina, as outlined in the principles of Sun Yat-sen,[6] drove forward\r\nwith striking success. The Nationalist troops everywhere pushed their\r\nenemies before them with astonishing speed. The explanation is to be\r\nfound in part in the efficiency and military honesty of officers and\r\nmen, but even more in the nonmilitary factors which fortified the armies\r\nand the ideological weapons which cleared the ground before it. The new\r\narmies not only represented military might; they were also propaganda\r\nmachines. To every regiment there was attached a political staff to keep\r\nup the morale of the troops and to win over the enemy and the civilian\r\npopulation. The troops themselves were propaganda brigades as well as\r\nmilitary units. Literacy in the armies was made a point of great pride,\r\nand certain divisions made novel reputations for themselves on this\r\nground. The Nationalists were known by many as the soldiers who did not\r\nharm the people. Without the troops the Nationalists would never have\r\ncome to power; but without the supporting sweep of mass propaganda the\r\nNationalist movement might have gone on for decades in the form of\r\ncivilian conspirators fighting against overwhelming odds or else seeking\r\nto make venal mercenaries the prime instrument for the regeneration of\r\nChinese civilization.\r\n\r\nThe military revolution of 1926-1927 brought new factors to the Chinese\r\nmilitary scene. It indicated that a point of equilibrium had been\r\nreached between the military and the ideological modes of control and\r\nthat it was no longer possible for sheer force and a minimum of\r\nintelligence to hold unchallenged power in the Chinese society. It was,\r\nfurthermore, a threefold struggle: a patriotic and progressive uprising\r\nagainst domestic and foreign oppression and inefficiency; an agrarian\r\nrevolt on a grand scale; and a proletarian uprising on the part of the\r\nrelatively small but strategically placed Chinese proletariat. Only in\r\nthe first of these aspects did the revolution meet with the approval of\r\nmost Chinese--the victims and not the bearers of arms. Men of all shades\r\nof opinion were able to agree on a policy of attacking the system of\r\n_tuchüns_, which offered no planning for the future, no resurrection of\r\nthe past, and little public order. The patriotic troops were enraged by\r\nthe corruption and inadequacy all about them and by the fortresses of\r\nprivilege reared by aliens on their coasts and in their greatest inland\r\ncities.\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1926-1927 marked the identification of the coolie\r\nsoldier with his own class and of the peasant fighter with his. The rank\r\nand file were given to understand that they were not fighting in some\r\ngame beyond their understanding but for the security of people like\r\nthemselves. Under the influence of the propaganda put forth by the\r\nNationalists and the allied Communists, an incipient agrarian revolt was\r\nfanned into flame and proletarian uprisings in the cities were made\r\npossible for the first time. Whole sections of the countryside fell into\r\na condition not far from anarchy as the revolutionary troops led the\r\npeople in revolt. After 1927, however, the military forces developed\r\nalong two antagonistic lines. The Nationalists, seizing the political\r\ninstruments of the revolution but finding its ideological factors\r\nlargely beyond their control, began to create a professionalized army\r\nwith which to stabilize their regime. The Communists, and their agrarian\r\nallies, standing to the Left of the newborn Nanking government, were\r\neager to fight on in the tested informal fashion. In the year of the\r\nestablishment of the Nanking government, 1927, the Red Army could still\r\ndemonstrate its effectiveness. Shortly afterward the precautionary arms\r\nembargo of the foreign powers, which had prevailed since 1919, was\r\nlifted, thereby opening up the means by which Chiang K'ai-shek could\r\nrenovate and specialize the armies under his command.\r\n\r\nThe break with the war-lord tradition was much more obvious in the case\r\nof the Communists than in the case of the Nationalists. The Communists,\r\nlacking sufficient support to occupy any broad contiguous territory,\r\nfell back on guerrilla fighting of their own. The Nationalists, strong\r\nenough to hold a certain portion of the area, nevertheless compromised\r\nwith the existing military system to seek mastery. For three years after\r\nthe establishment of the Nanking government, it remained doubtful\r\nwhether the whole government might not subside into inertia and neglect,\r\nleaving Chiang standing alone, distinguished from the other war lords\r\nonly by his character.\r\n\r\nLate in 1930 and early in 1931 a menacing alliance was organized between\r\ntwo of the most influential remaining Northern _tuchüns_ and the\r\n\"liberal\" wing of the Nationalists. Operating from the north, after the\r\nproclamation of an insurgent \"National Government\" at Peking, the rebels\r\nat first seemed to have the military advantage. Chiang had learned many\r\nlessons, however, and in the most serious fighting which China had seen\r\nin years he broke the force of the Northern offensive. Airplanes\r\nappeared as a threat against the civilian population of Peking, although\r\nno actual deaths were reported. There were ugly rumors that gas was\r\nbeing used at the front. Small tanks from England, though giving a\r\nrather poor performance, symbolized a novel trend. More and better heavy\r\nartillery was used than ever before. Trenches came up to World War\r\nstandards. The war ended with the intervention from Manchuria of Chang\r\nHsüeh-liang, a strangely progressive and patriotic _tuchün_; but the\r\nfighting had been enough to show that of all the great armed forces in\r\nChina the Nationalist armies of Chiang K'ai-shek and the Nanking\r\ngovernment were the most effective.\r\n\r\nThe rehabilitation of men's thinking had not proceeded far enough to\r\neliminate the dangers of an overemphasized military leadership, but the\r\ntide had turned. After 1931 the military situation in China had become\r\nsubordinate to the problems of ideology and of government. The chief\r\nmilitary factors were now the governmentalized armies, the guerrilla\r\nopposition of the Communists, and the problem of foreign war.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Age of Air Conquest_\r\n\r\nThe new military period which replaced the war-lord system was marked by\r\n(1) technical improvement of the armies, especially in the direction of\r\nair power; (2) supplementation of the armies by the quasi-military power\r\nof the civil government, so that Chinese wars ceased to be a question\r\nof armed bands drifting about the surface of the social system;\r\n(3) organization of the Nationalist armies into national units in\r\nfact as well as name; (4) increasing pressure of the disbandment\r\nproblem; (5) development of guerrilla tactics by the Reds and of\r\nguerrilla-suppression tactics by the Nationalists; (6) problems arising\r\nfrom Japanese conquest, which overwhelmed Manchuria in one fierce\r\nonslaught and harassed China for six years of military aggressions\r\nbefore breaking forth anew in the catastrophic surge of 1937-1938.\r\n\r\nAviation was to leap to a sensational place. Aviation and national\r\ncivilian government became almost natural complements of one another.\r\nOnly by aviation could all parts of the country be brought under the\r\njurisdiction of Nanking and the geographical handicaps of China be\r\novercome, and only a national government could afford the long-term\r\ninvestments in machines and men necessary to effective air armament. The\r\nrecord of technical improvement in the Nationalist armies is clearly\r\nsymbolized by the advancement of military aircraft. Military aviation in\r\nChina previous to the establishing of the Nanking government\r\ndemonstrated the weakness of the preceding regime. As early as 1909 a\r\nFrench aviator was giving demonstration flights over Shanghai.[7] The\r\nCh'ing dynasty sought to establish an airplane factory but met with no\r\nsuccess. Yüan Shih-k'ai purchased a few planes and set up a flying\r\nschool. The first telling use of planes in Chinese politics and war\r\noccurred, however, with the bombardment of the imperial palace by a lone\r\naviator in the course of an attempted monarchical restoration in 1917.\r\nIn the period of the war lords there were many isolated efforts to build\r\nup flying services. The most promising of these, undertaken by the\r\nPeking Republic with British assistance after 1920, failed through\r\nneglect, mismanagement, and corruption. As late as 1928 there was no\r\nprospect of significant air fighting in China.\r\n\r\nBy 1931 the Nanking government had built up an air force of about\r\nseventy serviceable planes; a contemporary commentator observed,\r\n\"Aeroplanes played a very considerable--some would even say a\r\ndecisive--part in the civil war of 1930....\"[8] By 1932, when an\r\nAmerican aviation mission arrived to help in the training of a Chinese\r\nmilitary air force, the estimates ran into a total of 125 to 140\r\ncommercial and training planes.[9] In the ensuing five years the Chinese\r\nnational air force developed rapidly. It played the leading role in\r\nsuppressing the Fukien uprising of 1932-1933 and in driving the\r\nCommunists into the Northwest. In 1937 the head of the American aviation\r\nmission, Colonel John Jouett, wrote, \"Japan maintains that China has a\r\nthousand planes; my guess would be seven hundred and fifty of all types.\r\nBut no one knows....\"[10] Other experts would reduce the figure to\r\none-third or less by the elimination of planes which would not be of\r\nfirst-class utility in actual combat. The preparations for foreign\r\nhostilities up to 1937 were accompanied by such a degree of secrecy that\r\ndefinite figures are not available. For domestic purposes, however,\r\nalmost every plane would count, and the cardinal fact remains that\r\ndomestically the National Government possesses a monopoly of air power\r\nin China. It is thereby in a better position to make its supreme will\r\nformidably known than was any emperor of any dynasty. The future may\r\nshow that Chinese mastery of aircraft is psychologically as important as\r\nwas mastery of the steamship for the Japanese--a visible demonstration\r\nto an Asiatic people of their own accomplishments with Western\r\ntechnology.\r\n\r\nAs for other improvements of the armies, only three factors need be\r\nmentioned. The armies were consolidated generally, and with their better\r\nstatus--in literacy, pay, means of subsistence, and regularity of\r\ncontrol--there came a realization that the military force was the\r\ncreature of the national state. The Chinese nation was taking form as an\r\nideological and social entity of sufficient strength to command the\r\ndirect allegiance of fighting men. A new respect arose for the officers\r\nand men of the armies. Under Yüan Shih-k'ai the armies had been able to\r\nevolve a respectability of their own making; under Chiang K'ai-shek this\r\nrespectability began to be accepted at its face value by the rest of the\r\nsociety, so that a pilot was not only admired by the crowd but was\r\nrecognized as an expert among experts, even in literary and civil-minded\r\ncircles. Secondly, the armies affected the nation by road construction.\r\nIn the course of the Nationalist-Communist wars of 1927-1937 the\r\nNationalists built thousands of miles of highway in order to make full\r\nuse of their new mobility gained from machine power. The military roads,\r\nsupplemented by civilian roads built with an eye to military use,\r\nconstituted a network of communications upon which a new political\r\ngeography could be framed--with new strategic points and new avenues of\r\ncommerce. Thirdly, the armies began to emphasize culture and comfort.\r\nThe soldiers were given a taste of twentieth century life and standards;\r\ntheir civilian kin and friends who lived under less favorable conditions\r\nsaw in the elite sections of the armies a mass demonstration of China's\r\nmodernization.\r\n\r\nIn the age of air power in China the relation between the army, the\r\ngovernment, and the economy was revolutionized. The new power of a state\r\nwith actual authority[11] led to the creation of an army dependent on an\r\nintricate and sensitive financial and economic system, operating under a\r\nregular scheme of law. The strength of the government made modern armies\r\npossible; modern armies made corresponding political forms imperative. A\r\nresulting tendency was for the armies to take on national form. Even in\r\nthose areas where _tuchünism_ had left its imprint upon society, or\r\nwhere provincial autonomy provided a factual check upon the national\r\nauthorities, the regional armies accepted organizational details and\r\nlong-range plans set forth by the central government. Armies which had\r\narisen as dumps for the unemployed or as resources for civil war were\r\nfitted together so as to make the Chinese forces resemble the other\r\narmies of the world--which exist for the preservation, defense, or\r\naggrandizement of national states. Foreign military observers, equipped\r\nwith the critical faculties of their profession, might look at the\r\nChinese armies and state point-blank that China had not an army but\r\nmerely armed men. They could not, however, deny that the Chinese armed\r\nforces in their latest phase were on the way to becoming an army\r\nnationally organized and fit to serve as the instrument of a great\r\nnation. The lessons of nearly a thousand years of European and American\r\npolitical experience may be epitomized in great part in the word\r\n_nation_; the Chinese armies helped to give this word true significance\r\nin China.\r\n\r\nFor the time being, the armies continued to serve their role of a refuge\r\nfor the economically displaced. Armed paupers are a menace to the\r\nsecurity and stability of any society; with the emergence of a higher\r\ndegree of Chinese unity a great proportion of the armed forces lost\r\ntheir _raison d'être_. Nevertheless, the last great war-lord war, that\r\nof 1930-1931, was fought largely over the issue of army reduction. The\r\nNational Government forces gradually increased in preparation for the\r\ndisbandment of others--extensive bodies of irregulars were roughly\r\nsystematized and placed under central supervision. They were used in\r\nmoderately successful but insufficient colonization efforts in the\r\nNorthwest, and as labor reserves in the construction of highways,\r\nairports, and similar projects. Even so, the size of the armies did not\r\ncease to interfere with their rapid improvement. Too much had to go into\r\npay, even with the ridiculously low rates of compensation. As against\r\nthe estimates of nearly 1,400,000 men for 1921 and about 1,900,000 for\r\n1926, the size of the armies was unofficially estimated at 2,379,770 for\r\n1936.[12] This figure did not include Communists, brigands, or the\r\nManchurian garrisons in the service of the Japanese (the Manchoukuo\r\narmy), which would bring the total to well over 2,500,000 men.\r\nDifferences in definition of what made a coolie or peasant into a\r\nsoldier caused violent discrepancies in the estimates. If training equal\r\nto that of a German Republican Reichswehr soldier were set as the\r\ncriterion, the Chinese army could be measured in scores. If some more or\r\nless vague relation to a military payroll, or to the possession of arms,\r\nor both, were taken as the requirements, the number would run into\r\nmillions. Japanese propagandists, in the light of these facts, made\r\ninjudicious statements when commenting thus on the Chinese army of 1937:\r\n\r\n  China had 198 divisions comprising 2,250,000 officers and men. This\r\n  gigantic army has further been reinforced by 200,000 Communist\r\n  soldiers whom Nanking worked hard to set against Japan.\r\n\r\n  In comparison the Japanese Army is a puny affair, consisting of 17\r\n  divisions of 250,000 officers and men.[13]\r\n\r\nThe well-informed expert on Chinese famine relief, Walter H. Mallory,\r\nset the total for 1937 at 1,650,000, of which 150,000 were Communist and\r\n350,000 the crack troops of Chiang K'ai-shek; arms would be available\r\nfor less than 1,000,000.[14] All factors considered, the figure of\r\n2,000,000 armed men with nonproductive occupations seems to be in rough\r\naccord with the facts. Two salient conclusions emerge from these\r\nfigures: Firstly, the armies constituted an enormous burden, which could\r\nonly be reduced by partial disbandment; this in turn would not be\r\nachieved until greater national prosperity had become a fact. Secondly,\r\nand in China's favor, the armed forces have spread some elementary\r\nnotions of modern fighting throughout the rest of the population and\r\nhave enhanced not merely the willingness of the Chinese masses to fight\r\nbut also their capacity to do so.\r\n\r\nDisbandment programs had not made enough progress by 1937 to alter the\r\ngeneral position of the armies in Chinese society. Nevertheless, the\r\ncounterpart of disbandment--selective recruiting--produced a central\r\nforce which became the vocation, avocation, and passion of Generalissimo\r\nChiang K'ai-shek. Though not marked in any recognizable way as apart\r\nfrom the rest of the armed forces, the central units were given special\r\narms, special equipment, regular pay, mass education, and training in\r\nthe patriotic and reform doctrines of the New Life movement. \"Chiang's\r\nown\" were to distinguish themselves; they seem to have profited by new\r\n_matériel_, modern military instruction (chiefly from Germans), and the\r\nexcellent opportunities for practice which arose from the Communist wars\r\nof 1928-1937. They were a testimonial to the fact that, had the\r\ndisbandment program fully materialized, a more effective and much\r\nsmaller Chinese army might have appeared. Despite the failure of\r\ndisbandment, alliance with the quondam enemies, the Chinese Red Army,\r\ngave the national forces of 1937 a great diversity and wealth of actual\r\nexperience in all types of fighting. Although the Chinese have never had\r\nadequate training for aggressive, coordinated warfare, they possess a\r\nmarvelous background in guerrilla methods. The Communist forces have\r\nbeen hunted for a decade; technical superiority they have learned to\r\nmeet by tactics which force the enemy to meet them on their own terms.\r\nUltimately they were driven by the Nationalists across China, but at\r\nmost disproportionate cost. The Nationalists, on the other hand, learned\r\nto master the terrain of inland war and thus acquired the very knowledge\r\nwhich a foreign enemy would need most.\r\n\r\nIn time, the Chinese armies became increasingly less the free agencies\r\nof domestic tyrants and, after the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, more\r\nand more the protective force for the whole nation. The enemy began to\r\nforce Chinese society into national form more sharply than could any\r\npressure from within. Even the efforts of the National Government at\r\nNanking to make a truce with the Japanese in order to continue the drive\r\nagainst the Communists failed to still the widespread clamor for\r\nunification. Whether or not Chiang, as a soldier, thought successful war\r\nwith Japan conceivable, he found that destiny had cast him in the role\r\nof the defender--he had only the choice of accepting or rejecting the\r\nchallenge.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Governmental and Political Role of the Armies_\r\n\r\nBroadly, the political role of the armies was that of giving a\r\nday-to-day index for the influence of ideological control, and of\r\nproviding the framework to which government had to accommodate itself.\r\nThe Republic was born with Sun Yat-sen as its father but with Yüan\r\nShih-k'ai as its midwife. Yüan and his armies established the order in\r\nwhich the parliamentary Republic had its illusory success; with his\r\ndeath the military order broke into military anarchy, and the political\r\norder disappeared almost completely from the arena of actual power. The\r\narmies and the tuchüns expressed a certain provincial autonomy and a\r\ndesire for a crude stability. They ruled the chaos but kept the society\r\nstirred by war until the Nationalist-Communist revolution in 1926-1927\r\nbrought ideology back to a conspicuous place in the play of events. The\r\narmies developed under Yüan into separate entities exercising the power\r\nderived from the monopoly of force. In time this monopoly of force was\r\nbroken. The problem was one not of tyranny but of anarchy. Force was too\r\nbroadly distributed, order too insufficiently achieved. The Chinese,\r\nsaid Sun Yat-sen, did not need liberty; they needed wealth, in the form\r\nof food for those starving and the necessities of life for impoverished\r\nmillions.[15] When even soldiers were treacherous and tumultuous, order\r\ncould not come from bayonets. It had to arise within men's minds,\r\nincluding the minds of the soldiers. This happened; the ideological\r\nrevolution absorbed the military forces, but only to disgorge them, as\r\nit were, into opposing camps--the one identifying military power and the\r\nmasses, the other seeking to build up a new military elite with which to\r\nimpose government and law on the society. Each of the two incompatible\r\nideals reached a considerable measure of fulfillment, and they were\r\nreconciled only by the very presence of alien invaders. From being the\r\n_de facto_ rulers, the armies found themselves called upon to act as _de\r\nfacto_ defenders. Hitherto the forces unsettling ideological control,\r\nthey became the instruments of ideologies reconciled on the minimal\r\nterms of national defense for national existence.\r\n\r\nThe armies had supplied the power necessary to government but not the\r\norder. The Peking Republic lost its claim to authority when it was made\r\nthe tool of Yüan Shih-k'ai. The years after his death were a pitiful\r\nperiod wherein the civilian authorities in the central government\r\nconstituted either the puppets of the war lords or their sycophants. The\r\nPeking Republic fell into the expedient of giving _de jure_ status to\r\nevery shift in the interplay of power. Military leaders of provincial\r\nimportance easily captured the functions of _tuchüns_; regional leaders\r\nobtained correspondingly higher titles. The Peking Republic tried to\r\ngovern on the Western pattern when the country was not ready for it, and\r\nit governed poorly. Soon it passed from nominal control into\r\nnonexistence.\r\n\r\nThe National Government established at Nanking in 1927[16] gained actual\r\neffectiveness partly because the armies under its command were in need\r\nof essentials not obtainable by merely military measures. The modernized\r\nNationalist armies under Chiang K'ai-shek were dependent upon a\r\ncomplementing state which would provide support behind the lines.\r\nFurthermore, the cry from the educated classes for civilian government\r\nwas loud, and practical considerations prompted the acquiescence of the\r\nNationalist generals in the development of civilian government. Although\r\nby 1938 a government primarily civilian was not yet in evidence, the\r\nauspices were favorable to the regularization and demilitarization of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nFinally, the most significant role of the armies may be found in their\r\ndestructive powers. Modern weapons coming into China pressed on her the\r\nmold of a modern state. By preventing any tranquil change from the\r\nCh'ing dynasty to another form of government preserving the older\r\ncontrols of village and family, Western armament brought China into a\r\ncondition of military anarchy in which a strong modern government became\r\nimperative. The armies and their irresponsible leaders goaded the masses\r\ninto the revolution of 1926-1927, and the necessity of establishing\r\nmilitary superiority for the sake of stability led the victorious\r\nNationalists to create a modern defensive force, a working government,\r\nand the outline of operative statehood--to be partly Chinese, but\r\nmodified by Western influences, according to the teachings of Sun\r\nYat-sen. From 1931 on, the army and the government became more and more\r\nthe integral parts of a single machine.\r\n\r\n\r\n_War and the Agrarian Economy_\r\n\r\nThere is a close correlation between militarism and agricultural\r\nconditions in China. Distress among the Chinese farming masses is both a\r\ncause and an effect of war. Misery creates unrest, unrest brings war,\r\nwar brings misery--until government stops the vicious circle. On the\r\nwhole, the economic system of old China was probably more stable, and\r\nensured greater distributive justice, than did the Western systems\r\nduring the same centuries; but periods of famine, flood, and--worst of\r\nall--oppression were far from rare.[17]\r\n\r\nAt its best, the old economy rested on a vast body of farmers,\r\nassociated in villages (_hui_) and families but tilling their own land\r\nin fairly small units. The farming class provided the nourishment for\r\nthe bulk of society but did not hold a low status, since the\r\ncompensations of interclass kinship and of free play in the hierarchy of\r\npolitics and intellect made families (if not individuals) approximately\r\nequal. There were no families in old China to compare with the\r\naristocracy which Europe inherited from the Middle Ages, nor castes to\r\ncompare with those of India. When functioning well, the Chinese economic\r\nsystem resembled some Western ideals of freehold farming governed by a\r\nhierarchy of scholars.\r\n\r\nBut at its worst, when the government became sterile and unimaginative,\r\nor corrupt and demoralized, the taxes rose sharply, and usurers added to\r\nthe burden. Lack of resources caused the loss of the land, and the\r\npeasant proprietor found himself a tenant farmer. When economic and\r\npolitical exploitation overreached itself, social upheaval followed, and\r\npeasant rebellions tore down the government and the economy together.\r\nMost Chinese dynasties met their end as a consequence of the land\r\nproblem.[18]\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Chinese farmer maintained very slight reserves of\r\nfoodstuffs, so that flood or drought resulted in appalling famines,\r\nsometimes costing the lives of millions in one year. Governments\r\nestablished large granaries which, under good management, were filled in\r\ntime of plenty and dispersed in time of need. R. H. Tawney says of\r\ndrought and flood:\r\n\r\n  Those directly affected by them cannot meet the blow, for they have no\r\n  reserves. The individual cannot be rescued by his neighbors, since\r\n  whole districts together are in the same position. The district cannot\r\n  be rescued by the nation, because means of communication do not permit\r\n  of food being moved in sufficient quantities. Famine is, in short, the\r\n  last stage of a disease which, though not always conspicuous, is\r\n  always present.[19]\r\n\r\nWhether or not natural calamities struck in conjunction with specific\r\nextortions sanctioned by social injustice, the Chinese farmer has been\r\nfaced with threefold oppression whenever times were bad. The tax\r\ncollector, the usurer, and the landlord were able to lay their hands on\r\nthe harvest, reduce the peasant to subsistence level or beneath it, and\r\nplace him under a system of exploitation which was as severe as Western\r\nfeudalism. The check which provided a stop to any indefinite decline\r\ninto greater and greater horror was the fighting power of the peasants.\r\nPeasant revolts periodically followed agrarian oppression, and swept the\r\nland free for the time. The Han dynasty, in some ways the greatest in\r\nall Chinese history, went down in an uproar of peasant rebellions.\r\nPeasant bandits have provided the ancestry of many imperial houses.\r\nPolitics or war might ease the economy, until the government again\r\nbecame weak and exploitation common.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the tragic coincidences of history that the Europeans\r\nshould have appeared in China at a time when the Chinese were entering\r\nupon one of their most acute periods of agrarian decline and class\r\nexploitation. Roughly, from the middle of the eighteenth century down to\r\nthe present day the lot of the Chinese farmers has become worse and\r\nworse. At periods the country as a whole seemed fairly prosperous, but\r\nthe broad agricultural recession remained constant. The nineteenth\r\ncentury was one long record of rebellions, and the twentieth amplified\r\nthe disturbances.\r\n\r\nGovernment in modern China has fallen heir to a depression centuries\r\nold, arising from inequitable land distribution, overtaxation,\r\ninsufficient public works for drainage and communications, and--in more\r\nrecent generations--the evils attendant upon sharp economic change. Most\r\neconomic writers agree that some of the difficulties of Chinese\r\nagriculture are caused by the smallness of individual holdings and by\r\npopulation pressure. Such factors are not subject to immediate remedy;\r\nthe peasants have attributed their misfortune primarily to landlordism\r\nand political oppression. The Chinese Communists, on their economic\r\nfront, may perform a valuable service if they are able to devise new\r\nmethods of social organization which will provide relief for the organic\r\ndifficulties of Chinese agriculture. Of all the important problems of\r\nChina, the land problem shows government ineffectiveness at its worst.\r\n\r\nBehind the T'ai-p'ing rebellion which flared up in unparalleled\r\nfanaticism in the 1850's and 1860's, there was the long provocation of a\r\nland system which made farming unprofitable and a government supine in\r\nthe face of unreversed decline. The Boxer rebellion burst forth from the\r\nunrest of the peasants, although it could be deflected by the\r\ndemagoguery of the Manchu officials and changed into wild xenophobia.\r\nWhen the fiercely discordant economics of imperialism and international\r\nindustrialism intruded upon the old and already corrupted economy, farm\r\nexistence became even less tolerable than it might have been if left to\r\nits native miseries. Dynastic decomposition was hastened by the collapse\r\nof handicraft economy and the fiscal disorganization caused by Western\r\ncommercial activity.\r\n\r\nIn the earliest days of the Republican-Nationalist movement led by Sun\r\nYat-sen, emphasis was on land reform. Sun Yat-sen's family had suffered\r\nfrom overtaxation when he was a boy.[20] Nationalization and\r\nequalization of the land were slogans used at the founding of the _Tung\r\nMêng Hui_; the program seems at that time to have been derived from old\r\nChinese distributism and from Henry George.[21] With the coming of the\r\nRepublic, two years went by, however, before any agrarian legislation\r\nwas passed, and the new laws had no perceptible consequence.[22] The\r\nproblem of land reform had to be fought out on the ideological front and\r\nplaced above the military before it could become a fit subject for\r\ncompetent government action.\r\n\r\nThe epoch of the _tuchüns_ added to agricultural misfortune. Militarism\r\nhad a direct effect on the deterioration of the land economy, and an\r\nindirect one in that it led to the cultivation of opium as the one\r\nmoney-making crop which could meet the excessive tax demands of the\r\nmilitarists. A Chinese writer has described the years which marked the\r\nending of the _tuchün_ system as follows:\r\n\r\n  The ... misery among the farming population in the decennial period\r\n  1920-1930 [must be] attributed to (1) internal warfare; (2) neglect of\r\n  agriculture; (3) low stage of art; and (4) over-population. The civil\r\n  wars during the last eighteen years have increased the cost of\r\n  production, have added to the farmers' ... burden of taxation, have\r\n  raised the rate of interest on loan, and have caused endless suffering\r\n  to [those] who form the basis of our social and economic life. Great\r\n  many people have often wondered as to why a country like China with 75\r\n  per cent of her total population engaged in farming and with such a\r\n  vast territory should suffer from the high cost of living; but to the\r\n  student of social problems the question is comparatively simple, for\r\n  the recurrence of civil war since the establishment of the Republic\r\n  has [changed] conditions of supply and has driven millions of farmers\r\n  out of cultivated areas, and this alone suffices to explain an\r\n  unprecedented rise of prices of food and other necessities of life\r\n  during the last few years, especially since 1926.[23]\r\n\r\nThese conditions led to farmers' movements, which became effective,\r\nhowever, only as they merged with the broader ideological tendencies in\r\nChina.\r\n\r\n  The Farmers' Movement ... may ... be divided into four periods: (1)\r\n  the period of reaction to bad conditions ... (1921-1925); (2) the\r\n  period of communistic activities and violence (1925-1927); (3) the\r\n  period of retrenchment and preparation for reconstruction (from the\r\n  spring of 1927-1928); and (4) the period of reconstruction (since\r\n  1928).[24]\r\n\r\nThe Kuomintang-Communist alliance struck severely at the _tuchün_ armies\r\nby giving their own forces a sense of doctrine and by tying together the\r\ncauses of patriotism and agricultural reform. The joint agrarian program\r\nwas a failure in that it accentuated precisely those issues on which\r\nneither of the parties could compromise. When the Communists and the\r\nNationalists parted, the Nationalists took one portion of Sun Yat-sen's\r\neconomic program (industrialization and communications) for emphasis,\r\nand the Communists another (land reform). The agrarian issue was a\r\nsource of strength to the Chinese Red Army, intent upon winning the\r\npeasantry. It was a military weakness to the new-style Nationalist\r\narmies officered largely by the relatives of landlords; they had little\r\nsympathy for the economic troubles of the farmers whose lands they\r\noccupied. The Nationalist Reconstruction aimed in great part at removing\r\nboth the acute and the latent causes of peasant rebellion, thereby\r\ncutting the ground from under the feet of the Communists. Although it\r\nmet with more success than any other project of its type in modern\r\nChina, Western observers agree in regarding it as inadequate.[25]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Imperialism and Chinese Wars_\r\n\r\nA great part of the military disturbances in modern China can be\r\nregarded as both the cause and the effect of agrarian evils, and some of\r\nthe struggles as peasant rebellions in modern guise, carrying on the\r\nimmemorial farmer-infantry tradition. Another part is traceable to the\r\nimpact of the Western economy on China. It was Western economic activity\r\nthat gave most compelling proof of the fact that the Westerners had\r\nencircled China and were compressing it from a world in its own right\r\ninto a nation. The military intervention of Western powers in China not\r\nonly caused much of the ideological reaction and forced a reorganization\r\nof the government, but also provided deadly evidence of the superiority\r\nof Western fighting. Western economy helped to bring the confusion which\r\nmeant war in China; and Western economy itself waged war.\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen saw China's unfortunate position as a whole, and in his\r\nprograms there may be discerned three separate demands, for (1) a\r\nnational economic revolution, (2) an industrial revolution, and (3) a\r\nsocial revolution.[26] Since the Chinese could no longer function as a\r\nself-contained world economically, and scorn foreign trade as a\r\nmagnanimous concession to the outer barbarians,[27] the Chinese would\r\nhave to develop an economic system conforming to national patterns in\r\nthe society and in thought. They must relate their economy to their\r\nindependence and defense, if they were to survive. In the first place,\r\nthey could not afford to remain the only free market of the world,\r\nsubject to exploitation and haphazard development. It would be necessary\r\nfor them to establish governmental controls over economic matters and\r\nprotect their national livelihood. Secondly, they had to work toward a\r\ncomplete transformation of their technological system and meet Western\r\nproductive practices, if they were to claim a competitive position; this\r\ninvolved an industrial revolution. Thirdly, they had to correct the\r\nabuses inherited from their forefathers. Simultaneously they would have\r\nto construct an economic system not only modern but equitable, if they\r\nwished to avoid the horrors of early capitalism and the tragedy of the\r\nindustrialist class war. This would require a social revolution.\r\n\r\nAt the time that Sun Yat-sen formulated his ideas (1924), none of the\r\nthree revolutions was making any progress. The Chinese did not\r\nconstitute a nation in fact; they had even lost the old unity of the\r\nConfucian society. The _tuchüns_ opposed Chinese nationalism by\r\npreventing the development of any one authority able to monopolize\r\nforce, and by acting as agents of, or in alliance with, foreign powers.\r\nThus they helped to make China something not far from a quasi colony\r\nunder pooled control of all the industrial capitalist nations. The\r\nNationalists and Communists were able to join forces on this issue of a\r\nclass war of nations, both believing in the independence of China. The\r\nNationalists, however, saw China's most direct approach toward national\r\nunity in the development of a national economic system, with a\r\nreasonable military independence of imports and the economic devices\r\ncurrent throughout the world as instruments of national policy. The\r\nCommunists did not agree that such an economy, national in form, would\r\nhave much meaning unless it were grounded upon a peasant-proletarian\r\nregime. Nor did they feel that change from imperialist to native\r\ncapitalism would constitute an advance in itself.\r\n\r\nAfter the schism, the Nationalists devoted themselves to the\r\nnational-economic and industrial revolutions, while the Communists\r\nstressed the social revolution, particularly the land problem. The\r\nNationalists were able to secure tariff autonomy for China, and\r\nthereupon entered upon a policy of protective tariffs and other\r\nmechanisms designed to make China a reasonably self-sufficient nation.\r\nAt the same time they pushed hard toward the industrial revolution, in\r\ndeveloping highways, railroads, airways, and radio, and in creating the\r\neconomic controls required for modern government--standard weights,\r\nmeasures, currency, civil law, and fiscal uniformity.\r\n\r\nT. V. Soong (Sung Tz[)u]-wên), a veteran minister of finance, stands out\r\nas the organizer of the modern Chinese economy. Veritable miracles were\r\nperformed in the development of national credit; after 1928 the National\r\nGovernment adopted the policy--as remote as a mirage to its\r\npredecessors--of floating all government loans within the country and\r\nmaking the Chinese government independent of Japanese and Western\r\nfinanciers. The only loans of any importance contracted abroad were\r\ntaken up with other governments. Financial independence was a great step\r\ntoward the realization of the Nationalist ideals, but it may be\r\nquestioned whether the loss of financial allies was a price to be paid\r\nwithout hesitation in a capitalist world. Had the Chinese had more bonds\r\nin the Western capital markets, or larger debts to the American or\r\nBritish governments, they might have elicited greater international\r\nsupport in repelling the Japanese invasion in 1931.\r\n\r\nThe crowning point in the economic achievements of the National\r\nGovernment at Nanking was the successful institution of a managed\r\ncurrency. China had dealt with currency merely as a convenient form for\r\nspecie, and the Chinese were accustomed to regard a dollar as worth only\r\nthe amount of metal in it. When the National Government placed the\r\ncurrency on a national basis, it drew together the whole financial\r\nstructure of China by one gigantic move, and placed finance in a\r\nposition of greater unity and dependence upon government than ever\r\nbefore. Together with the financial reforms, the Nationalists organized\r\na legal system providing a minimum foundation of law and order. The\r\ncodification of laws, the revamping of the judiciary, the clarification\r\nof policies by legal formulation--all these contributed to China's\r\nemergent nationhood.\r\n\r\nThe economic program accorded with considerations partly Hamiltonian,\r\npartly state-socialist. The economy had first of all to be organized and\r\nintegrated in national terms, and later to be revised so as to ensure\r\nsocial justice. The Nationalists were convinced that a policy of\r\nimmediate land reform would lead to internal disharmony and frustrate\r\nthe very purposes for which the revolution of 1926-1927 had been\r\nlaunched. The Communists, on the other hand, succeeded in keeping the\r\nagrarian issue from being forgotten and forced the Nationalists to\r\nbetter the lot of the peasant. In the meantime, China's boom in physical\r\ndevelopment and the unification of the commercial, financial,\r\nproductive, and legal systems began to startle observers.\r\n\r\nAs a result, China was able to build national armies in direct ratio\r\nwith the invigoration of her national economic system. The war machine\r\nof the National Government, under the care and leadership of\r\nGeneralissimo Chiang K'ai-shek, became the most powerful in China. The\r\ncentral government's military power in turn speeded up the pace of\r\ngeneral unification. There was thus a remarkable interaction of forces\r\ntending toward national integration. From 1932 to 1937, between the\r\nfirst and second major phases of the Japanese invasion, progress was\r\nrapid--stimulated, perhaps, by the external menace.\r\n\r\nThe two greatest dangers to the Nationalist policy of military and\r\neconomic unification were (1) the dismal condition of the Chinese\r\nproletariat, as yet small but constantly growing, and (2) the vested\r\ninterests of the industrial powers. Had China's growth been less rapid,\r\nthe foreigners might have withdrawn slowly and found compensation in\r\nChinese commerce for their losses in direct ownership in China. There\r\nwas one power, however, to which Chinese unification was a living and\r\nincreasing threat. The rising military-economic power of the Chinese was\r\nincompatible with the position which Japanese leaders visualized as part\r\nof the manifest destiny of their country. The Japanese might have\r\ntolerated the _tuchün_ system for decades had the _tuchüns_ been able to\r\nestablish orderly regional governments; or they might have aided a\r\nreactionary Chinese regime which asked for survival only. The appearance\r\nof a genuine republic in the Far East was a menace to Japan; if that\r\nrepublic was bound by sheer physical proportions to overshadow Japan,\r\nthe unification and modernization of China had to be averted at all\r\ncosts.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, China's development, even apart from the hindrances of\r\nwar, cannot be regarded as possessing the same potentialities as did\r\nAmerican growth during the past century. China, from all indications\r\navailable to date, is an area much poorer in natural resources than is\r\nthe United States; she does not offer comparable opportunities for the\r\nheavy industries. The steel, coal, oil, and water power necessary for\r\nlarge-scale industrialization are by no means negligible, but not\r\nsufficient to make possible the rise of another America. The far future\r\nmay change man's dependence upon currently utilized resources and\r\nfacilitate greater strides in China's technological advancement.\r\nMeanwhile, she can look forward to decades of measurable development\r\nthrough exploiting raw materials already available, if political\r\nconditions permit.\r\n\r\nThe conflict with Japan has thrown Chinese economic development back to\r\nconditions not too far from the pre-Nanking stage. China not only faces\r\nthe handicaps of social dislocations but also the ruin of her factories\r\nand her industrial centers. The Japanese have destroyed much of the\r\nChinese manufacturing equipment and are placing what remains under\r\nJapanese control. Significantly, the deadliest enemy of Japanese\r\nbusiness--in the unlikely event of a complete Japanese success--will be\r\nJapanese-owned factories in China. Chinese labor will deeply affect\r\nJapan's domestic production, unless the Japanese succeed in\r\nrationalizing their economic system to an extent not yet contemplated.\r\nHence, Japan's losing the war may well be brought about by bankruptcy\r\nfrom sheer military indebtedness; her winning the war, however, may lead\r\nto more remote but no less certain ruin--through the competition of\r\nChinese output with Japanese home industries disadvantaged by the\r\ncheaper labor markets of China. But Japan's loss is not inevitably\r\nChina's gain, and the Chinese may find themselves, at some point in the\r\nfuture, controlling an industrial system which has been wrecked, looted,\r\nand bankrupted.\r\n\r\nWhatever the ultimate outcome, loans will again play a part in Chinese\r\ndevelopment. The placing of large foreign loans has been a key part of\r\nChinese development, and the task of reconstruction in China--no matter\r\nwho undertakes to do it--will require large amounts of capital.\r\nConsequently, the loan policies of the wealthier nations may return to\r\nthe importance which they enjoyed in 1913, and the dictates of the\r\nWestern states may again direct the lines of Chinese economic progress.\r\nThe effects of the Japanese conquest, if it is partial and then lapses\r\ninto a stalemate, may well be determined by the extension of loans to\r\nthe Chinese or to the Japanese in China. The effect of the war has\r\nalready complicated the picture of China's economic future to the extent\r\nof making even cautious prophecy hazardous.[28]\r\n\r\nIn the military sphere, the Chinese have come of age, although their\r\nfighting strength will be determined by the importance of infantry. If\r\nlater wars continue to depend upon man power, China will become more and\r\nmore significant in world politics. Internally, the armies provided (1)\r\na transitional administration from the Empire to the Republic; (2) a\r\nphysical expression of the ideological confusion and the regional\r\ndisunity of China from 1916 to 1931 (the period of _tuchüns_); (3) the\r\narmed edge of the ideological revolution of 1926-1927; (4) decisive\r\ninstruments in the conflict between the Communists and Nationalists from\r\n1927 to 1937; and (5) one of the most powerful unifying agencies at the\r\ncommand of the National Government at Nanking. The Chinese military\r\nsystem spread the knowledge of Western warfare and, with it, of modern\r\ntechniques throughout the country; it shaped the ideological and\r\ngovernmental experience of modern China.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] See below, pp. 154 ff.\r\n\r\n[2] Rodney Gilbert in _The China Year Book_, 1921-2, p. 519, Tientsin,\r\n1921.\r\n\r\n[3] _Ibid._, 1926, p. 1065.\r\n\r\n[4] _Ibid._, p. 1062.\r\n\r\n[5] See above, pp. 51 ff.\r\n\r\n[6] See above, pp. 58 ff.\r\n\r\n[7] Gilbert, _loc. cit._, 1928, pp. 1283-1285.\r\n\r\n[8] _Ibid._, 1931, pp. 251 ff.\r\n\r\n[9] Source confidential.\r\n\r\n[10] John H.

The problems of government in\r\nRepublican China are affected but not determined by the fate of\r\nindividual governments. Movements and armies have predetermined action;\r\ngovernments have reflected it. Government in China may be divided into\r\nthree chief periods. The first extends from prehistory to 221 B. C. The\r\nsecond is the imperial period.[1] The third--the Republican epoch--did\r\nnot begin until 1912, although it was foreshadowed in the nineteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Government to the End of the Warring States_\r\n\r\nIn the semihistoric Shang dynasty, which ruled China during the second\r\nmillennium B. C., there was a central overlordship which might well have\r\nclaimed primacy over all offices of the world. In its own territory,\r\nShang rule seems to have been based not upon a feudal system such as\r\ndeveloped later in the time of the charioteering lords but upon the\r\nreduction of defeated princes to positions of vassaldom. History cannot\r\nyet tell of the exact relations between the Shang overlord and his\r\nvassal princes, nor of other monarchs who, in the shadowy bypaths of\r\npresent knowledge, stand forth vaguely from complete obscurity as rivals\r\nto the hegemony of Shang. The rulers of twenty-five or twenty-six\r\ncenturies ago are recognized by modern Chinese as the direct\r\npredecessors of the Ch'ing emperor who in turn yielded to the Republic.\r\nThis is no case of a Mussolini seeking to weave together the long-broken\r\nthreads between Augustan and modern Rome; in China the succession is as\r\ndirect as that from St. Pius I to Pius XI. The central monarchy comes\r\nover the edge of history as an identifiable institution.\r\n\r\nIn rudimentary form this monarchy already suggests the features of\r\nbureaucracy. Like the Prussian kings thousands of years later, the Shang\r\nmonarchs seem to have relied upon commoners as their royal officials,\r\nand for the same reasons. A commoner strengthened the position of the\r\nmonarch: \"He could not easily usurp the place of his master, even if he\r\nhad the power. And if he was disobedient he could be executed on the\r\nspot, with complete impunity; he had no powerful clan to exact\r\nvengeance.\"[2] Whether or not the system of loose overlordship be termed\r\n_feudalism_, social forms not too unlike European feudalism originated\r\nunder the next dynasty, the Chou (traditionally dated 1122-256 B. C.).\r\nConquering the great city of the Shang, the Chou turned to feudalism for\r\nmeans of internal control and defense. Powerful vassals arose, however,\r\nso that after the eighth century B. C. the original Chou dynasty was no\r\nlonger in actual command. From the eighth to the third century B. C.,\r\nwhen China was consolidated under the Ch'in Shih Huang Ti, a rapid\r\nspread of feudal organization brought about a state system resembling\r\nthat of early modern Europe.\r\n\r\nBefore the Chou rulers lost their power and became the faraway analogues\r\nof the late Holy Roman emperors or the Tennos of shogunal Japan, there\r\nemerged from their house one of the most remarkable of all Chinese\r\npolitical leaders. The Duke of Chou, who lived in the eleventh century\r\nB. C., seems to have done most in founding the system which later ages\r\ncalled _Confucian_--after Confucius had reformed it, clarified it, and\r\ngiven it ethical stature. He is also regarded as the father of the\r\nConstitution of Chou, a plan for a bureaucratic monarchy with an\r\nemperor, three Great Dukes, and six ministers (in charge of\r\nadministrative, educational and economic, religious and historiographic,\r\nmilitary, judicial, and engineering matters, respectively) ruling over\r\nnine large provinces.[3] The Duke of Chou is finally credited with the\r\nauthorship of several important treatises. He has served as the\r\narchetype of intellectual statesmanship in Chinese legend. His work may\r\nhave contributed in great part to the long life of the Chou dynasty, as\r\na _de jure_ ruling house, since a family which had produced such an\r\neminent member was not to be set aside lightly.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier part of this period the feudal order seems to have\r\nensured relative stability, but in the later part a system of states\r\narose. The greatest Chinese philosophers, Confucius (Kung Fu-tz[)u]) and\r\nLao Tz[)u], lived in interstate turmoil. They saw all about them the\r\ndisplacement of virtues which had long been recognized, the advance of\r\nstates which substituted greed for morality, the centralization of\r\npower, the destruction of the feudal economy, the transformation of\r\nceremonial warfare into outright slaughter, and the rising disrespect of\r\nthe advancing kings for the Chou overlord. Lao Tz[)u] preached a\r\nphilosophy devoid of constructive politics; he had little use for the\r\nstate and for the organization of society. Not quite an anarchist, his\r\nprograms are probably closer to those of Herbert Spencer than of any\r\nother Western thinker. But the spiritual and psychological background\r\nfrom which he wrote is roughly identical with that of the world's great\r\nmystical intuitionists. Confucius (551-479 B. C.) preached a system of\r\nethics and education which was to rationalize and systematize preceding\r\nChinese thought and lead to the system of ideological control known as\r\nConfucian.\r\n\r\nChinese historians themselves term the closing period of the Chou the\r\nAge of Warring States. Diplomacy lubricated the machinery of conflict,\r\nsmoothing struggle without eliminating it. The regional governments\r\nfought each other for centuries, though at times venturing into\r\ncollective security pacts entrusting authority to a preeminent king for\r\ndefense against the outer barbarians. The last years of interstate wars,\r\nhowever, were marked by an ever increasing awareness of the meaningless\r\ncharacter of a struggle which had enveloped the Chinese world. Legalism\r\nand militarism, twin media of centralized monarchy, blossomed forth.\r\nWhile the Western political system, molded by geography and conditioned\r\nby language, has frozen into a pattern of theoretically sovereign and\r\ntheoretically eternal states--the \"mortal Gods\" of Hobbes's\r\nimagination--without promise of workable universal government, China's\r\nstates were swept aside by the conqueror Ch'in Shih Huang Ti, who\r\nestablished imperial unity for Chinese government. With the rise to\r\ndomination of the state of Ch'in, its king took the title of _Shih_\r\n(First) _Huang Ti_ (Emperor), and the Chinese Empire was established.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Chinese Imperial Government_\r\n\r\nThe Shih Huang Ti was not revered by succeeding ages for the great\r\nmission which he performed. His methods were those not of a cautious\r\nreformer but of a bullying conqueror. With the aid and advice of a\r\nlegalist philosopher, he organized all of China (covering the area of\r\nmuch of modern China) into a strongly centralized and despotic military\r\nmonarchy. He destroyed all books not of obvious practical use,\r\ncompletely eradicating the histories of rival states and the works of\r\nphilosophers whose opinions might undermine his regime. His tyranny\r\nbrought his house to a rapid end; his heirs held the throne only a short\r\nwhile. But the work he had done was done. He had persecuted the worship\r\nof the past. He had extirpated a large part of the literature which\r\nmight have survived as a source of dissent. He had cleared China of all\r\nmilitary power but his own. He had brought operative law into being and\r\nhad spread the institution of private ownership of land. Feudalism might\r\nremain as a form, but its economic and political realities were lost.\r\n\r\nIn 206 B. C. there began the reign of the Han dynasty. They effected a\r\ncompromise between the past and the governmental, military, and\r\npolitical system created by the Shih Huang Ti. They retained legalism in\r\npractice but turned more and more to Confucianism. Under them the cult\r\nof Confucius grew into the major influence on the state.[4] The Han\r\nallowed the imperial system to grow, whereas the Shih Huang Ti had\r\nsought to build it. In consequence, Han rule--although interrupted in\r\nthe time of Christ by a Utopian usurper--lasted from the third century\r\nB. C. to the third century A. D. There followed the turbulent Chinese\r\nmiddle ages, extending until the reinstitution of organized government\r\nwith the Chin and the Sui.[5]\r\n\r\nOut of the earliest tradition attributed to the Duke of Chou and put in\r\ndefinite shape by Confucius, out of the arbitrary military despotism of\r\nthe conqueror of the Chinese world, Shih Huang Ti, and out of the actual\r\npractices of the Han, there evolved a governmental system which, though\r\naltered dynasty by dynasty and epoch by epoch, nevertheless retained its\r\ngeneral form down into the days of men now living. It never became,\r\nhowever, the prime agency of government, even of the men governing.\r\nRitual and scholarship were more significant functions of the dominant\r\nhierarchy than was administration itself. The emperor was the head of\r\nthe country's family structure, the focal point in the social sphere,\r\nthe outstanding member of the community at large, the chief examiner and\r\nmodel of the scholars, the pontiff of the quasi-religious hierarchy, the\r\nmoral scapegoat and intermediary between destiny and mankind, and the\r\nautocrat of a despotism constitutionalized, as it were, by the power of\r\ntraditional practices.\r\n\r\nThe imperial system of China was thus a monarchy in the proper sense of\r\nthe word, with none of the parvenu features suggested by the etymology\r\nof the word _imperial_. As the preeminent leader in an organic society,\r\nthe emperor held a position comparable with that of other family heads.\r\nHis authority could rival that of a father but not excel it; among all\r\nthe families of the Chinese Empire the imperial stood forth as a family.\r\nSecond, the emperor was the chief dignitary in the social life of the\r\nChinese world. He was not unlike the British monarchs, providing a model\r\nof formal propriety and elegance in setting the fashions of the decade.\r\nThe physical isolation of most of the emperors prevented them from\r\nplaying this role with widespread effectiveness, but it was a part of\r\ntheir function. Third, the emperor bore the relation to the Empire which\r\nthe outstanding villager bore to the village. It was he of whom men\r\ntalked; his behavior commanded greatest interest; his future conduct was\r\na constant source of speculation. Apart from his role as a formal\r\ndignitary, he occupied the more immediate position of most conspicuous\r\nperson, of the first member of society. He had the human accountability\r\nof a leader and was to be praised or blamed for his actions in the\r\nhistories and by his subjects. In the normal routine, the emperor\r\nhimself was not to govern; but he selected and supervised his ministers,\r\nwho did and who consequently bore the odium for evil deeds.\r\n\r\nFourth, the emperor himself was the ultimate examiner of scholars. He\r\nthus had contact with the most successful of the civil service\r\ncandidates and completed their examination. These examinations served\r\nthe emperor as a means of selecting advisers who upon further testing\r\nbecame ministers. The Forest of Pencils (_Han Lin_, the Imperial\r\nAcademy) was within his jurisdiction, and the emperor was supposed to be\r\nenough of a scholar to check the most important of the documents of\r\nstate. The myth of intellectual supremacy is suggested by the fact that\r\nthe chief implement of the imperial office was a red pencil. The\r\nimperial symbolism did not stop here. Fifth, the quasi-religious\r\nhierarchy of the Chinese, competing with Buddhism and the superstitions\r\nof popular Taoism for the support of the people, centered on the\r\nperformance of certain rites in the propitiation of fortune and the\r\nhonoring of the dead. To this were added the cult rituals of\r\nConfucianism. The Confucian temples, with tablets bearing the names of\r\nworthies, served as the visible demonstration of the ideological power\r\nwielded by the scholars over the populace, and of the emperor over the\r\nscholars.\r\n\r\nSixth, the emperor had the more definitely religious status referred to\r\nin his title _Son of Heaven_. He was the intermediate figure between the\r\nwill of Heaven and mankind. In him were summarized and epitomized the\r\nvirtues or the evils of the generation; he had to represent mankind in\r\nits best light to all supernatural forces or agencies. Upon his conduct\r\nof worship depended the good or ill will of the deities and hence\r\nweather, crops, life and death. Conversely, he was responsible to\r\nmankind for the misbehavior of nature, and an earthquake, a two-headed\r\ncalf, or any other monstrous occurrence was blamed on his disturbance of\r\nthe routine of things. The order which enveloped the Confucian society\r\nwas conceived not merely as a set of traditional and moral man-made\r\ncustoms but as a type of behavior which fitted in with the life of the\r\nnatural world. In the eyes of the Chinese, perturbations in the world of\r\nmen soon produced consequent natural calamities. Lastly, the Chinese\r\nemperor was the autocrat of the administration. His action, however, was\r\nlimited by various customary devices; for example, while the\r\ncountersignature of a minister was not needed on an edict, the emperor\r\nwas supposed not to take the initiative but to secure the wisest\r\nsuggestions and adopt them. Practical considerations rendered a stable\r\nbureaucracy impervious to constant intermeddling of the emperor,\r\nalthough the effect of imperial action was not negligible.\r\n\r\nThe administrative outline of Chinese government from the establishment\r\nof the Empire by the Ch'in Shih Huang Ti in 221 B. C. to its overthrow\r\nby Sun Yat-sen and his followers in 1911 varied from dynasty to dynasty\r\nand ruler to ruler. Nevertheless, certain general characteristics were\r\ncommon to the whole period. The government operated as the chief\r\nimplementation of the emperor's power over the people. The people\r\nmaintained its social organizations, but none of these developed office\r\nhierarchies comparable to that of the government. The government alone\r\nserved as the connecting link between the ideologically unified Chinese\r\nworld as a whole and its many separate parts. The T'ang dynasty (A. D.\r\n620-906) provided an exceptionally clear articulation of the Empire,\r\nwhich not only compelled the admiration and imitation of later ages but\r\neven served as a model for state governments on the periphery of the\r\nChinese world. In the great Taikwa Reforms of 645, the Japanese made a\r\nheroic attempt to adapt the T'ang form of government to dissimilar\r\nconditions; the scheme worked on paper but failed to recast the\r\nfundamental mold of Japanese society, which remained feudal.\r\n\r\nThe three most striking features of the Chinese bureaucracy were: (1)\r\nthe central administrative organization; (2) the operation of civil\r\nservice examinations and the use of administrative supervision; (3) the\r\nintegration of government operation on the imperial, regional, and local\r\nlevels. The metropolitan administrative organization under the T'ang\r\ndynasty was headed by the emperor. But the intricate regularity of the\r\nhierarchy beneath him was such as to preclude imperial autocratic\r\ncaprice. The outline of the hierarchical organization was as follows:[6]\r\n\r\n  THE THRONE\r\n\r\n  THE GRAND COUNCIL\r\n\r\n  The Departments:\r\n\r\n  _a._ Department of Ministerial Coordination\r\n     1. Ministry of Administrators\r\n     2. Ministry of Finance\r\n     3. Ministry of Rites\r\n     4. Ministry of War\r\n     5. Ministry of Justice\r\n     6. Ministry of Public Works\r\n  _b._ The Imperial Chancery\r\n  _c._ The Grand Secretariat\r\n\r\n  The Tribunal of Censors\r\n\r\n  Imperial Commissioners\r\n\r\n  Provinces (10) and _Governments-General_ (at the frontiers)\r\n    Prefectures\r\n    Subprefectures\r\n    Townships\r\n    Villages\r\n\r\nThe general structure of Chinese administration differed little from\r\nthat of preceding ages, and has not changed markedly during the\r\nfollowing centuries. Later developments strengthened the provinces, at\r\nthe expense of both the central government and the local areas; earlier\r\nconditions had tolerated a much greater extent of feudal establishments.\r\nNevertheless, the six ministries may have been established as early as\r\nabout 1000 B. C., and remained a feature of Chinese government until\r\n1906.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Council met daily. It was composed of grand ministers, who--in\r\nthe phrase of Baron des Rotours--\"under the T'ang held in their hands\r\nthe government of the Empire.\"[7] The emperor's chief power lay in\r\nappointing the council members, to whom fell the greater share of\r\ngoverning in fact. Directly under the Grand Council there were the three\r\ndepartments. The Department of Ministerial Coordination served as an\r\nadministrative center and clearinghouse for the work of the separate\r\nministries under it. The names of the ministries are self-explanatory.\r\nThe Ministry of Administrators was in charge of the examination system\r\nand the arrangement of the offices in the bureaucracy. The Ministry of\r\nRites, by an extension of its protocol features, was in charge of the\r\nreception of foreign (\"barbarian\") princes and ambassadors, and\r\nemissaries. The other two departments provided one of the most ingenious\r\nsystems of checks and balances to be found in any constitutional scheme.\r\nThe Imperial Chancery received all communications from the various parts\r\nof the Empire. Since most of the governing was carried out by means of\r\nwritten orders, instructions, and requests for reports, the Chancery\r\noccupied an important place. But the function of drafting replies to\r\nsuch communications, preparing manifestoes, or issuing ordinances was in\r\nthe hands of the Grand Secretariat. Thus the Chancery was prevented from\r\nexerting an outside influence, while it was impossible for the\r\nSecretariat to receive any communication directly. As a final check, all\r\noutgoing documents of state had to pass through the Chancery to receive\r\nthe official seal, without which they were invalid. Thus any item of\r\ngovernment business was routed first through the Chancery for\r\nregistration and classification, then to the Secretariat for reply, and\r\nback to the Chancery for what amounted to countersignature (by seal).[8]\r\nYet the Secretariat was no mere drafting agency for the Chancery.\r\n\r\nThe Tribunal of Censors occupied a position not unlike that of the great\r\nindependent establishments of the United States government. It was\r\ndirected by a president and two vice-presidents, and concerned itself\r\nwith ferreting out and exposing irregularities and abuses in the\r\nadministration. The morale of the censorate varied from time to time,\r\nbut at its optimum efficiency it was a formidable and significant\r\ninstitution. Han Confucianism provided the general background from which\r\nthe organization rose to effectiveness.\r\n\r\nThis sophisticated and rationally designed central bureaucracy was\r\nsupplemented by regional administrations. Under the T'ang the regional\r\nestablishments were a source of trouble to the government. The Empire\r\nwas divided into provinces, but the provincial administrations were\r\nsuperseded by Imperial Commissioners whenever an emergency arose. Later\r\ndynasties placed the provincial system on a more stable basis, which\r\nresulted in genuine and geographically sound regionalism. The provincial\r\ngovernments were replicas in miniature of the central; their heads might\r\nbe regarded as appointive and removable satraps whose authority was a\r\nsmaller reproduction of the power of the emperor. It was not until the\r\nMing dynasty (A. D. 1368-1643) that the provinces took on their modern\r\nform. The provincial governments were a source of great strength to\r\nChina in that they made possible a quasi-federal government. In the\r\nCh'ing period no officer was eligible to a post in his native\r\nprovince;[9] this custom had considerable centripetal effect and offset\r\nthe danger that populace and officials, united by common sympathies,\r\nmight revolt or secede.[10]\r\n\r\nAnother feature to be noted about the Chinese government under the\r\nEmpire was the examination and civil service system. The T'ang dynasty\r\nprovided for three major types of examination: (1) The _chü_\r\ncorresponded most closely to a modern academic degree, and allowed the\r\ncandidate to qualify in any one of a number of subjects, including the\r\nclassics, law, and mathematics. (2) The _hsüan_ was the special\r\nexamination necessary for appointment to a post in the bureaucracy; it\r\nwas both written and oral and included the personal history of the\r\ncandidate. (3) The _k'ao_, an in-service examination, consisted of\r\nannual reports on the performance of all officers in the Empire. They\r\nwere transmitted to the Bureau for Examination of Merits in the Ministry\r\nof Administrators on a schedule varying with the distance of the office\r\nfrom the capital. There were five points on which to report: virtue and\r\njustice; integrity and circumspection; equity and impartiality;\r\ndiligence and activity; and one of twenty-seven special talents suitable\r\nto the particular office in question. The grades received on these\r\nreports determined the advancement or demotion of the officer, in\r\naccordance with an elaborate and exact schedule.[11] All three\r\nexaminations provided the administrative form for the close relation\r\nbetween the government and the scholastic elite. The _chü_, with its\r\nemphasis on the classics, framed the content of all curriculums. The\r\n_hsüan_, with its oral examination and personal record, made the\r\nprospective candidate careful in observing the customs. The _k'ao_ kept\r\nup the morale and efficiency of the bureaucracy, while the ominous\r\nTribunal of Censors was present to guard against abuse of the system.\r\nEvery detail was precise, well ordered, explicit, to a degree that would\r\ndelight present-day industrial personnel managers. Formulation was\r\nrefined and impressive. In fact the T'ang laws, although their part in\r\nChinese life was less than a Westerner might expect, were a code of such\r\nforce and appeal that the Japanese and the Annamese used them as a model\r\nfor their juridical systems.[12]\r\n\r\nThe decline of particular dynasties in China--caused by poor economic\r\npolicy, demoralization of the court, corruption of the bureaucracy,\r\nlaxity in the examinations, oppression of the farmers--did not effect\r\ngreat alterations in the structure of government. With the centuries the\r\nChinese government settled into more and more definitive form.\r\nUnfortunately, the Manchu government (1644-1911)[13] had sunk into\r\nadministrative demoralization when the full force of the Western impact\r\nwas felt. In the early nineteenth century a British observer wrote of an\r\nimperial official:\r\n\r\n  The late _tungling_ [gendarmerie commander] Wanking, degraded last\r\n  year for connecting himself with a magician whose confessions went to\r\n  implicate a large number of nobles and public servants, was a Reader\r\n  at the Classical Feasts, Manchu President of the Board of Civil\r\n  Office, Revisor-General of the Veritable Records of the Reign, a\r\n  Superior of the Academy, Supervisor of the Household, t'utung of a\r\n  Banner [military division], superintendent of the Gymnasium in the\r\n  Ning-shan Palace, and of the Treasuries of the Board of Revenue, and\r\n  Visitor of the 17 Granaries in the City, and at Tungchau.[14]\r\n\r\nWhen such conditions of indifference toward sharply defined hierarchic\r\nethics began to be common among the bureaucracy, the end of the dynasty\r\nwas near. The Chinese Empire had remained intact even when it had fallen\r\ninto the hands of Tartars, Mongols, and Manchus. It had returned to the\r\nbases of its former greatness, and the administrative machinery created\r\nsince the day of the Shih Huang Ti continued for twenty centuries. With\r\nthe decrepitude of the Manchu dynasty, and the simultaneous collision\r\nwith the Western world, the old political system broke and had to be\r\nreshaped into new forms. Nevertheless, even in the Republican era\r\ntechniques of the T'ang have reappeared in the administration of\r\ngovernment services.\r\n\r\nUnderneath all shifts there remained a series of social groupings which\r\nwere affected far less than were the broad and conspicuous central\r\nregimes. They have existed since the times before organized government,\r\nand may well be sufficiently strong to set the conditions under which\r\nany government or any race of rulers will succeed or fail in China.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Family, Village, and Hui_\r\n\r\nThe ideological control in old China operated through those groups most\r\nclosely attached to the individual. The government was not one of them.\r\nThe fundamental strength of Chinese society rests upon the cohesion and\r\npower of three outstanding quasi-political agencies: the family system,\r\nthe village and district, and the _hui_ (associations, leagues,\r\nsocieties or guilds.)[15] The family was an intricate structure,\r\n\"composed of a plurality of kin alignments into four families: the\r\nnatural family, the economic family, the religious family, and the\r\nsib.\"[16] The natural family corresponded to the family of the West. The\r\neconomic family commonly extended through several degrees of kinship,\r\nand may have included from thirty to one hundred individuals, who formed\r\na single economic unit, living collectively. The religious family was an\r\naggregate of economic families; it would be difficult to give any\r\nspecified number of constituent families as an average. This unit\r\nprovided the organization for the proper commemoration and reverence of\r\nancestors and maintained an ancestral shrine where the genealogical\r\nrecords were kept; the cult feature has largely disappeared in modern\r\ntimes. The sib resembled the clan as found in the West; its role was\r\ndetermined by the immediate environment. In some cases, especially in\r\nthe South, the sib was powerful enough to engage in feuds; at times one\r\nor more sibs dominated whole communities. In the greater part of China\r\nit was a loose organization, holding meetings from time to time to unite\r\nthe various local religious families which constituted it.\r\n\r\nFamily consciousness played its part in sustaining certain elements of\r\nthe Confucian ideology. It stressed the idea of the carnal immortality\r\nof the human race. It oriented the individual not only philosophically\r\nbut socially as well. The size of each family determined his position\r\nspatially, and family continuity fixed a definite location in time for\r\nhim. With its many-handed grasp upon the individual, the family system\r\nheld him securely in place and prevented his aspiring to the arrogant\r\nheights of nobility or falling into the degradation of a slavery in\r\nwhich he might become a mere commodity. A Chinese surrounded by his\r\nkinsmen was shielded against humiliations inflicted upon him by\r\noutsiders and against the menace of his own potential follies. It was\r\nlargely through the family system, with its religious as well as\r\neconomic and social foundation, that the Chinese counteracted\r\nundesirable mobility of individuals in a society stable as a whole.\r\nStability thus obtained a clear and undeniable purpose--the continued\r\ngeneration of the human race through the continuity of innumerable\r\nfamilies, each determined upon survival. A materialistic interpretation\r\nwould point out the need for cheap and plentiful human labor in\r\nmaintaining the agrarian economy of China, and reduce the rationale of\r\nthe system to a mere web of justifications.\r\n\r\nThe family was equaled if not excelled in importance by the village.[17]\r\nHad the family been the only vital social grouping, it might have been\r\nimpossible for democratic processes to develop in China. The family\r\npattern provided, indeed, the model for the government, but the\r\ninfluence of villages in Chinese life mitigated the familistic\r\ntendencies of government. It would have been heresy to revolt against an\r\nunrighteous father; but there was nothing to prevent the deposition of\r\nan evil village elder. In times of contentment, the emperor was the\r\nfather of the society; at other times he might be looked upon as a\r\nfellow villager subject to the criticism of the people. The village was\r\nthe largest working unit of local self-government; it, and the groups\r\nwithin it, such as the sib, was almost completely autonomous and subject\r\nto outside interference only in very rare cases. At the same time, the\r\nvillage was the smallest unit of district organization. The District\r\nMagistrate, as the government officer in charge of a district containing\r\nfrom one to twenty villages, relied on the village leaders in performing\r\nthe duties imposed upon him. Village government was at times very\r\ndemocratic.[18]\r\n\r\nNext in importance was the _hui_. It was in all probability the last to\r\nappear. Neither ordained, as the family seemed to be, by the eternal\r\nphysical and biological order of things, nor made to seem natural, as\r\nwas the village, by the geographic and economic environment, this\r\nassociation emerged from the Chinese propensity toward cooperation.\r\nParalleling and supplementing family and village, the _hui_ won for\r\nitself an unchallenged place in the Chinese social structure. The _hui_\r\nmay be classified into six categories[19]: (1) fraternal societies; (2)\r\ninsurance groups; (3) economic guilds; (4) religious societies; (5)\r\npolitical societies; and (6) militia and vigilante organizations. The\r\n_hui_ made up the greater part of the economic organization of old\r\nChina, and offered vocational education to men not destined for\r\nliterature and administration. Under such names as the Triad and the\r\nLotus the _hui_ provided the party organizations of old China and\r\nchallenged the dynasties whenever resentment was ripe.\r\n\r\nThe old Chinese society, made up of innumerable families, villages, and\r\n_hui_, comprised the whole \"known world.\" Its strength was\r\ninexhaustible. Having no one nerve center, the world society could not\r\nbe destroyed by the inroads of barbarians or the ravages of famine,\r\npestilence, and insurrection. The Confucian ideology continued. At no\r\none time were conditions so bad as to break the many threads of Chinese\r\nculture and to release a new generation from tradition. Throughout the\r\ncenturies education and government continued side by side, even though\r\ndynasties fell and the country was overrun by conquerors. The absence of\r\nany rigid organization of legal authority facilitated survival, while a\r\ncertain minimum of order could be maintained even in the absence of an\r\nemperor or, as more commonly occurred, in the presence of several.\r\n\r\nThe governmental superstructure kept the Chinese world together in a\r\nformal manner; it did not give it vitality. The family, the village, and\r\nthe _hui_ were fit subjects for imperial attention, but the emperor\r\ncould not remove his sanction from their existence and thereby\r\nannihilate them. No precarious legal personality was attributed to the\r\nfamily, the village, and the _hui_, which could be extirpated by a mere\r\nedict. It was possible for the English kings to destroy the Highland\r\nclan of the MacGregor--\"the proscribed name\"--without liquidating the\r\nmembers of the clan _in toto_. In China the emperor could wipe out a\r\nfamily by massacre, but it was practically impossible for him to destroy\r\nan organization without destroying all its members. On the whole,\r\nhowever, the government of China pursued its three main ends--the\r\nmaintenance of the ideology (education), the defense of the realm\r\nagainst barbarians (military affairs) and against adverse forces of\r\nnature (public works), and the collection of funds for the fulfilment of\r\nthese functions (revenue).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Governmental Changes Foreshadowing the Republic_\r\n\r\nThe pressure of the West compelled the Chinese government to define more\r\nclearly than ever before its own boundaries, its relations with the\r\nvassal states, and its lines of contact with the Chinese people. By the\r\nTreaty of Nerchinsk, negotiated in 1689 with Russia, the Chinese tried\r\nto demarcate their land frontier. The vassal nations presented a crucial\r\nproblem. The Chinese failed to make explicit their quasi suzerainty in\r\nterms comprehensible to Western jurisprudence. At the same time they\r\nfollowed a policy of brisk exaggeration of territorial rights\r\nalternating with outright disclaimer of responsibility. The scope of\r\ngovernment itself was affected by new functions which arose with the\r\ncoming of the Westerners. The tax system was expanded. The development\r\nof an imperial customs service with Western personnel and Western\r\nmethods of accounting provided the government with a source of large\r\nrevenue. The demands that Western states be given adequate consideration\r\nin the transaction of business led to the establishment in 1860 of the\r\nForeign Office (_Tsung-li Yamên_), a new institution which modified the\r\ntraditional administrative pattern.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Western states introduced their own type of government\r\ninto China through the demand that their citizens be subject only to the\r\nlaw with which they were familiar at home. In dealing with Westerners\r\nthe Chinese had at first employed a code far more Draconic than the\r\nprovisions of Chinese penal practice. After many years of irritation the\r\nWestern powers, under the leadership of Great Britain, secured\r\nextraterritorial privileges for their citizens. Extraterritoriality\r\nplaced Westerners in China solely under the jurisdiction of their\r\nrespective national representatives. If an American today were to shoot\r\ndown the Dalai Lama in Tibet, he could be tried legally only in the\r\nUnited States Court in Shanghai--although it is improbable that the\r\nTibetans would insist upon juridical niceties. Apart from the guarantee\r\nof personal immunity from Chinese law for their citizens, wherever they\r\nmight be in China, the Western powers, through a long series of special\r\narrangements and actual usage, obtained certain footholds on Chinese\r\nsoil where even Chinese were under Western rule. These areas were known\r\nas _concessions_ and _settlements_, and the cities of their location as\r\nthe _treaty ports_. Both the presence of Westerners subject only to\r\nWestern law throughout the Empire, and of areas where Western governance\r\nwas paramount, taught the Chinese the lesson of strong government.\r\n\r\nNor was this all. The British-Chinese treaty of Nanking (1842) and that\r\nwith the United States (1844) both contained provisions relating to the\r\nprotection of the life and property of foreigners. The imperial\r\ngovernment found itself pledged to the fulfillment of a policy which\r\ncollided directly with the xenophobia engendered by ideological control.\r\nThe enforcement of these provisions, half-hearted as it was, involved\r\nconstantly increasing imperial intervention in regional affairs,\r\nalthough the issues arising between the central government and the\r\nprovincial authorities were settled through negotiation rather than\r\nenforceable commands.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the nineteenth century the gradual transformation in\r\nChina gave rise to a reform movement carried forward by a group of\r\nconstitutional monarchists. One of their leaders, K'ang Yu-wei, became\r\nin 1898 the tutor of the young Emperor Kuang Hsü. The summer of that\r\nyear witnessed a steady stream of edicts which ultimately might have\r\nmade China under the leadership of the throne as progressive as Japan.\r\nThe reforms aimed primarily at efficiency and modernization, and\r\npartially at the parliamentarization of the regime. The young Emperor,\r\nhowever, was soon checked by Yüan Shih-k'ai, his leading military\r\nadviser, and outmaneuvered by the reactionary Empress Dowager. He spent\r\nthe rest of his life in actual imprisonment, and the Six Geniuses--as\r\nthe reformers behind his policy were called--were exiled or executed.\r\nOne of those who were put to death was the poet Tan Shih-tung, a man of\r\ngreat skill in the classical literature and of ambitious visions for the\r\nfuture, who might, had the Hundred Days succeeded, have lived to be a\r\nguardian of the throne in a modern Chinese Empire. Just before his\r\nexecution he wrote the following poem, calling forth the memory of\r\nChiang-ch'ing and Tou-keng, upright men of the past, and comparing his\r\nfaith with the mountain range of Kuang-lêng:\r\n\r\n  LAST SONG FROM PRISON\r\n\r\n    _Prison door facing me--thoughts of Chiang-ch'ing--\r\n    I could die easily, if like Tou-keng ...\r\n    Laughing and alone, I lift the knife to heaven:\r\n    I die but leave behind hopes higher than Kuang-lêng!_[20]\r\n\r\nReform, indeed, could not be downed. The Manchu dynasty itself began to\r\ntread cautiously in the footsteps of Japan. In 1905 an agency was set up\r\nfor the purpose of studying various foreign forms of government and of\r\nmaking recommendations for the modernization of the imperial government.\r\nIn 1908 a draft constitution, very similar to the constitution of the\r\nJapanese Empire, was approved. A nine-year program, from 1908 to 1916\r\ninclusive, was to lead to constitutional, parliamentary monarchy--if\r\nparliamentary monarchy be regarded merely as a monarchy with a\r\nparliament appended. The principle of cabinet responsibility to\r\nparliament was not established, and from the very beginning the Manchus,\r\nless wise than the ruling house in Japan, not only failed to grant\r\nsufficient powers on paper but began packing the quasi-parliamentary\r\ninstitutions before they were set up. Hand-picked, the preliminary\r\nNational Assembly which met in 1909 began wrangling with the Throne.[21]\r\nThe old Empress Dowager had died in the preceding year; so had the\r\nimprisoned Emperor Kuang Hsü. The new Emperor was an infant, and the\r\ncourt was little more than a gathering of bewildered Manchu princes\r\nlistening to the advice of the eunuchs and palace officials.[22] Reform\r\nfrom above, had there been a single man of will and courage to take\r\ncharge of it, might have had considerable chances of success. But while\r\nthe Manchus tinkered with the superstructure of government, the\r\nfoundations of society were washing away beneath their feet. More was\r\ninvolved than the improvement of administrative technique and the\r\nillusion of popular representation. A political and social revolution\r\nwas in the making. Sun Yat-sen was the man who, more than any other\r\nsingle person, shaped its course.\r\n\r\nIn 1893 Sun had gone north to advocate reform and present a petition to\r\nLi Hung-chang, an eminent imperial statesman.[23] The mission failed. In\r\n1897 Sun was willing to speak openly of revolution. He refrained,\r\nhowever, from advocating a republic before Western audiences, even\r\nthough his party was committed to it. He wrote in his book _Kidnapped in\r\nLondon_:\r\n\r\n  The prime essence of the movement was the establishment of a form of\r\n  constitutional government to supplement the old-fashioned, corrupt,\r\n  and worn-out system under which China is groaning.\r\n\r\n  It is unnecessary to enter into details as to what form of rule\r\n  obtains in China at present. It may be summed up, however, in a few\r\n  words. The people have no say whatever in the management of Imperial,\r\n  National, or even Municipal affairs. The mandarins, or local\r\n  magistrates, have full power of adjudication, from which there is no\r\n  appeal. Their word is law, and they have full scope to practice their\r\n  machinations with irresponsibility, and every officer may fatten\r\n  himself with impunity. Extortion by officials is an institution; it is\r\n  the condition on which they take office; and it is only when the\r\n  bleeder is a bungler that the government steps in with pretended\r\n  benevolence to ameliorate but more often to complete the depletion....\r\n\r\n  This official thief, with his mind warped by his mode of life, is the\r\n  ultimate authority in all matters of social, political, and criminal\r\n  life....[24]\r\n\r\nIn 1905 Sun Yat-sen lashed out at the monarchical reformers, subjecting\r\ntheir motives to vigorous criticism:\r\n\r\n  Since the Boxer war many have been led to believe that the Tartar\r\n  [Manchu or Ch'ing government] is beginning to see the sign of time and\r\n  to reform itself for the betterment of the country, just from the\r\n  occasional ... edicts ... not knowing that they are mere dead letters\r\n  made for the express purpose of pacifying popular agitations. It is\r\n  absolutely impossible for the Manchus to reform the country because\r\n  reformation means detriment to them. By reformation they would be\r\n  absorbed by the Chinese people and would lose the special rights and\r\n  privileges which they are enjoying. The still darker side of the\r\n  government can be seen when the ignorance and corruptness of the\r\n  official class are brought to light. These fossilized, rotten,\r\n  good-for-nothing officials know only how to flatter and bribe the\r\n  Manchus, whereby their position may be strengthened to carry on the\r\n  trade of squeezing [graft].[25]\r\n\r\nHe also insisted that China's difficulties could be solved only by the\r\nestablishment of a republic, which he envisaged with great optimism:\r\n\r\n  A new, enlightened and progressive government must be substituted in\r\n  place of the old one; in such a case China would not only be able to\r\n  support herself but would also relieve the other countries of the\r\n  trouble of maintaining her independence and integrity. There are many\r\n  highly educated and able men among the people who would be competent\r\n  to take up the task of forming a new government, and carefully\r\n  thought-out plans have long been drawn up for the transformation of\r\n  this ... Tartar monarchy into a Republic of China. The ... masses of\r\n  the people are also ready to accept the new order of things and are\r\n  longing for a change for better to uplift them from their ...\r\n  deplorable condition of life. China is now on the eve of a great\r\n  national movement, for just a spark of light would set the whole\r\n  political forest on fire to drive out the Tartar from our land. Our\r\n  task is indeed great but it will not be an impossible one....[26]\r\n\r\nSun's diagnosis of the situation was remarkably correct; he clearly\r\nsensed the coming Republic whose first president he was to become seven\r\nyears later. The ideological revolution was already under way, and the\r\nEmpire about to dissolve into the past. What neither Sun nor anyone else\r\nrealized was that ahead of China there lay government problems more\r\nserious than misrule. The ideological shift had terminated the reality\r\nof the old regime, and the military conditions were favorable; but would\r\nmen be ready to invest their faith durably in a new order?\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] See above, pp. 17 ff., 83 ff.\r\n\r\n[2] Herrlee G.

The bomb exploded accidentally; the secret storage of\r\nmunitions was discovered; the next day, in the ensuing turmoil, the\r\nRepublic of China was born. Double Ten Day (October 10, 1911) has since\r\nbeen celebrated as the Chinese Fourth of July. When the imperial\r\nofficials sought to suppress the insurrection, they uncovered a\r\nconspiracy in the ranks of their own troops; in self-protection the\r\ntroops revolted. In the next two months the Manchu Empire crumbled away.\r\nSun Yat-sen, who was in Chicago at the time of the outbreak,[1] could\r\ntrust his organization. Sure that destiny was working with him, he took\r\nhis leisure in returning to China and stopped in London to forestall\r\nfinancial aid to the collapsing Empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Presidency of Sun Yat-sen and the Republican Revolution_\r\n\r\nThe fall of the Empire was not the result of a great mass movement\r\nagitating the whole population; it developed from the revolutionary\r\nnucleus which Sun and his followers had built up to secure power. They\r\nhad hammered away at the imperial regime by instigating mutiny and\r\nterror for many years, since they realized that the incompetence of the\r\ngovernment was matched only by its impotence. The revolution itself was\r\na chain of rebellions, occurring province by province under the\r\nleadership of revolutionaries or officials joining the revolution.\r\nExcept for the massacre of Manchus in some of the cities, it was a\r\nnearly bloodless revolution. However, the various groups pushed in\r\ndifferent directions, and different men tried to seize power. The\r\nconstitutional monarchists compelled the throne to issue a very liberal\r\nconstitution, which might be accepted by the populace in place of the\r\nRepublican programs. Military men began to come to the fore, as the army\r\nunits alone were in a position of unchallengeable power. Men who had no\r\nthought of revolution might join it in time to become leaders of the\r\nrevolutionary-military juntas. Li Yüan-hung, an officer of the Empire,\r\nhid under his bed when revolutionary soldiers sought him out; given the\r\nchoice between death and adherence to the revolutionaries, he sided with\r\nthe new powers, and in a short while became the commanding officer of\r\nthe revolutionary forces in the Wu-han cities. Similar instances were\r\nnot uncommon.\r\n\r\nThe revolutionaries managed to call together representatives of their\r\nparty and of the troops to a National Convention at Nanking. They were\r\nseriously handicapped by the absence of Sun Yat-sen, who now hastened\r\nback to China from London. Few of the members of the revolutionary\r\ngroup--heretofore forced to operate as a secret society--were well\r\nenough known to have the prestige needed to form a new government. Huang\r\nHsing, Sun's chief military follower, sought to manage in the interim,\r\nbut not until the arrival of Sun Yat-sen in Shanghai on December 24,\r\n1911, was there a prospect of consolidation. Five days later the\r\nNational Convention elected him president of the Provisional Government\r\nof the United Provinces. On January 1, 1912, he took office; with the\r\nadoption of the Gregorian calendar now in use, this date became the\r\nfirst day of the Year I of the Chinese Republic. With the presidency\r\nthere was created a cabinet, whose ministers did not yet hold any\r\nspecific portfolios. The portions of the country under revolutionary\r\ncontrol were ruled for the time being by a temporary system which\r\ncombined the military and civilian governments in each province.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Empire was still the internationally recognized\r\ngovernment of China and continued to function in Peking. Thoroughly\r\nfrightened, the imperial court saw no alternative to calling into its\r\nservice the one man who could be expected to master the situation--Yüan\r\nShih-k'ai, who had ruthlessly terminated the experiment of the Hundred\r\nDays in 1898 and whipped up the first effective modern army of the\r\nEmpire. Yüan, who had fallen into disfavor as a result of court\r\nmachinations a few years before, waited his time, receiving offers from\r\nboth sides. Finally he went to Peking, on October 27, 1911.\r\n\r\nThe negotiations which ensued over the establishment of a new government\r\nand the pacification of the country brought into the spotlight two of\r\nthe outstanding personalities of modern China--men whose characters were\r\nto mold the institutions in a highly plastic society and whose\r\ninfluences were to last beyond their deaths. Sun Yat-sen, a Cantonese\r\nwith many overseas connections, stood outside the old-style elite--a\r\nconstitutionalist and an idealist. Yüan was a soldier and diplomat from\r\nthe North, narrow in outlook, altogether a tradition-bound official\r\ndespite his up-to-date military ideas--an opportunist and a realist in\r\npolitics. Rarely have two leaders represented such opposite extremes.\r\n\r\nIn the conclusion of the negotiations Yüan played a part which would\r\nhave filled Machiavelli with admiration. The imperial family was cajoled\r\ninto taking the baby Emperor off the throne but was at the same time\r\nwheedled into refusing outright abdication. The edicts of February 12,\r\n1912, are among the most curious state papers of modern times. They\r\nturned over \"the power of government\" to Yüan, admitted the faults of\r\nthe dynasty, and ordered him to negotiate with the revolutionists and\r\nestablish a Republic of China. Nothing was said about any eventual\r\nresumption of power by the dynasty, although provision was to be made\r\nfor the comfort and dignity of the court. The Manchu house was to retain\r\nthe Forbidden City (imperial palace) in Peking, where the monarch could\r\ncontinue to exercise his functions, freed from the cares of government.\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen indignantly repudiated any idea that the Republic derived\r\nfrom a formal authorization extended by the hated Manchus--the Republic\r\nfor which he and his revolutionists had struggled for decades. But he\r\nheld his peace, unwilling to upset the chances of national unification\r\non a point of form. Yüan was recognized as an able man, although he\r\nlacked trustworthiness and intellectual ability; it seemed possible to\r\nmake use of him and simultaneously to satisfy him by giving him a\r\nposition within the Republican framework. After the edicts of\r\nabdication, the issue became one of ultra-idealist constitutionalism\r\nversus brutal military realism.\r\n\r\nIt was agreed that Sun should keep the provisional presidency until Yüan\r\ncould be inaugurated as president. Under the circumstances it was the\r\nonly possible course. Yüan possessed decisive military power, and there\r\ncould have been no hope of bending him. Furthermore, Sun actually did\r\nnot wish the office of president. He realized that his own strength was\r\nthat of ideologue and leader and felt that by enforcing his principle of\r\n_min shêng_[2] he could serve China best.\r\n\r\nYüan, it was arranged, was to come south to the new capital at Nanking.\r\nThis was something which he had no desire to do, as the city was in the\r\nhands of the revolutionists and his army was in the north. When he was\r\npressed to take office, he engineered a military mutiny in the Peking\r\narea, which did enormous property damage and gave him an adequate excuse\r\nfor remaining where he was. By thus forcing the government to establish\r\nitself at Peking, he followed out the spirit of the imperial abdication\r\nedict and brought the Republican regime to the very city in which the\r\nEmperor still lived, and in which the imperial bureaucracy awaited its\r\nnew Republican garments--socially and ideologically the stronghold of\r\nresourceful reaction. There was thus no problem of creating a new modern\r\nadministration. The old Peking mandarinate continued, and the\r\nrevolutionary Republicans came into the government offices as strangers\r\nintruding into a closed system. For the initial months of the Republican\r\nexperiment Peking's novel status was merely the evidence of Yüan's\r\nprestige; thereafter, Peking was to become the embodiment of archaism,\r\nblind pragmatism, and corruption.\r\n\r\nOn March 10, 1912, Yüan Shih-k'ai took a solemn oath to preserve and\r\ndefend the Republic and assumed office as president. On the same day a\r\nProvisional Constitution went into effect, whereby the National\r\nConvention placed the greater share of government power in the hands of\r\na National Council, to serve until the promulgation of election laws for\r\nthe choice of a national parliament. Republican mistrust of Yüan was\r\nevident in this action. Yet Sun Yat-sen was satisfied that his first\r\nprinciple, nationalism, had been realized in great part by the expulsion\r\nof the Manchus, and that his second, democracy, was in the process of\r\nfulfillment. He turned to the realization of the third, _min shêng_.[2]\r\nYüan placed him in charge of all railway development in China, and Sun\r\ncherished the freedom to carry out the practical aspect of the\r\nrevolution. He had passed beyond the stage of agitation and conspiracy,\r\nof wandering about in the world, his life in year-long daily jeopardy,\r\nseeking men and funds for a revolution which seemed Utopian to most. Now\r\nhe could do his work quietly, without inducing simple merchants and\r\nworkers to risk sudden death or the torture racks of the Board of\r\nPunishments. He had no way of realizing that his miraculous success was\r\nto be followed by defeat and that the revolution for which he had fought\r\nwas not over but had only begun.\r\n\r\nThe presidency of Sun Yat-sen in Nanking, terminated by Yüan Shih-k'ai's\r\nassumption of office, was little more than a military and revolutionary\r\njunta linking together the various provincial revolutionary groups. It\r\nhad to face no serious problems of administration, and the collection of\r\ntaxes was the last thing that a brand-new revolutionary government would\r\ndare to stress in China. Its principles were republican, but it\r\ninaugurated no formal institutions and resorted to no elections,\r\nreferenda, or plebiscites. The task of constituting democracy in China\r\nwas placed under the stewardship of the most versatile military\r\nopportunist of the age: Yüan Shih-k'ai.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Parliamentary Republic_\r\n\r\nAfter Sun Yat-sen relinquished the presidency to Yüan Shih-k'ai and the\r\nRepublican regime settled down in the citadel of the old regime, a form\r\nof government was set up which did not immediately reveal itself as\r\npatently unworkable but which in retrospect seems a curiously\r\nill-conceived experiment in transplanting institutions. Sun and his\r\nfollowers assumed that democratic, parliamentary institutions were\r\nadaptable, that the existing grouping would soon lend itself to the\r\npurpose of effective multi-party government, and that parties would\r\narise organically from honest differences of opinion. They considered\r\nthe republicanization of the provincial and local governments of less\r\nimmediate importance than the establishment of a national democratic\r\norder. They expected to have a constitutional government with the five\r\n\"races\" of China--Chinese, Mongol, Manchu, Tibetan, and Turkic\r\n(Mohammedan)--united under the new five-barred banner. At the time,\r\nthese assumptions seemed practicable.\r\n\r\nThe Provisional Constitution of March, 1912, established a relatively\r\nweak presidency though with somewhat greater powers than the French.\r\nArticle 45 required the countersignature of all presidential orders by\r\nthe appropriate cabinet minister; the ministers were to be appointed by\r\nthe president with the concurrence of the legislative. Unfortunately,\r\nthe principle of ministerial responsibility to parliament was not\r\nexplicitly stated, although it might have been expected that the\r\nfar-reaching powers of the legislative body would have led to actual\r\nparliamentarism very shortly. It was obviously the intention of the\r\nRepublicans to promote Yüan to a position of ineffectiveness. The\r\npremier and the cabinet selected by the president with legislative\r\nconcurrence were to be subject to interpellation. On the other hand,\r\nthey were granted the privilege of speaking in the legislative body\r\n(Articles 43-47). The unicameral National Council (_ts'an-i-yüan_)--to\r\ncontinue only until the election of the legislative body--was to be\r\nconstituted in the following manner, under Article 18:\r\n\r\n  The Provinces, Inner and Outer Mongolia, and Tibet shall each elect\r\n  and depute five members to the National Council, and Ch'inghai\r\n  [Kokonor] shall elect one member.\r\n\r\n  The electoral districts and methods of election shall be decided by\r\n  the localities concerned.[3]\r\n\r\nAs a result of this procedural latitude, the delegates to the National\r\nCouncil were either elected by the provincial assemblies or appointed by\r\nthe military governors or came with no formal credentials whatever. All\r\nofficials were ordered to continue in their posts. The revolutionists\r\nstill exerted control over large military bodies in the South and held\r\nmany of the provinces under their military leaders or juntas, so that\r\nYüan proceeded cautiously in the creation of his first administration.\r\nHe chose personalities acceptable to the revolutionists, but appointed\r\nno outstanding men of Sun's Tung Mêng Hui.\r\n\r\nThe parliamentary system looked well enough on the surface, but the\r\nbasis of government had disappeared and the problem of mass democracy\r\nwas more fundamental than anyone then imagined. Many groups in the\r\ncountry began organizing as parties; Yüan himself appeared to further\r\nthe new way. But he had his own thoughts. He ordered his followers to\r\nenter the revolutionary units to undermine them, and simultaneously\r\npushed for the establishment of a party of his own. There was on all\r\nsides a pathetic eagerness to live up to the formal expectations of the\r\nWestern world. Tragically, this government was comic opera. Yüan began\r\nhaving skirmishes with the Council within a few months. The Republicans\r\nallowed the actual power to slip away from them while seeking to\r\nexercise the authority derived from a constitution which most citizens\r\nof the new Republic could not understand at all. In the summer of 1912\r\nSun Yat-sen's followers began to face a definitely hostile executive.\r\nThe Council looked for redress but found that parliamentary tricks\r\nturned easily against it. The conservative members, supporting Yüan,\r\nwalked out, and the Council lacked a quorum.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1912, the old revolutionary organization of Sun Yat-sen,\r\nfounded by his coordination of earlier secret societies, was transformed\r\ninto a regular party, the Kuomintang. The Kuomintang devoted themselves\r\nto the development of genuine party government; looking upon the\r\nRepublic as their own creation, they were less ready for compromise than\r\nChinese usage might have required. This did not improve the position of\r\nSun's adherents. Yüan countered by forming the Progressive Party\r\n(_Chinputang_). While both sides lost control over the people, the party\r\nsystem was not even important enough to amount to carpetbagging. The\r\nonly power in the country, as doctrine and administration melted away,\r\nwas the military.[4]\r\n\r\nUnder the terms of the Provisional Constitution the Council was to yield\r\nto a bicameral National Assembly, for which it should provide by law\r\nwithin ten months. It was to be the duty of the National Assembly to\r\nprepare a permanent constitution (Articles 53 and 54). In the summer of\r\n1912 the Council passed the required law, providing for the indirect\r\nelection of a Senate and the direct election, by a limited electorate\r\nand under a very complicated electoral scheme,[5] of a House of\r\nRepresentatives. About 1/35 of 1 per cent of the total population voted.\r\nThe Kuomintang came out far ahead of any other party, with a definite\r\nplurality but one insufficient to give it absolute control of the\r\nAssembly, which met early in 1913. Inexperienced even in the elementary\r\nrequirements of parliamentary practice, let alone the conduct of\r\ngovernment, the legislative branch was destined to be sheer ornament.\r\nThe Kuomintang had relegated themselves to the occupancy of the least\r\nimportant branch of the government. The new parliament met amid great\r\ntheatricals and placed heavy emphasis on form but was unable to make its\r\nwill felt. The quarrels with the President over foreign loans,\r\ndemocratic policy and party rule were not settled by a showdown, but by\r\nresort to technicalities on both sides.\r\n\r\nYüan, however, had his finger on the trigger. March, 1913, was marked by\r\nthe murder of Sung Chiao-jên, one of the ablest of Sun's followers. It\r\nwas the first political act to indicate that Yüan was embarking upon a\r\nprogram of assassinations. Even upon this occasion, Sun Yat-sen held his\r\nhand, ready to let the new regime prove its character. Yüan used the\r\nwaiting spell to replace Kuomintang men in the provincial armies and\r\ngovernments with his own adherents. In July, 1913, a second revolution\r\nbroke out. It was a move of self-defense on the part of the Republicans,\r\nfollowers of Sun. The revolution was suppressed by Yüan.\r\n\r\nUndisturbed, the work of constitution drafting proceeded apace in the\r\nNorth. Again, the trend, paradoxically, was toward French precedent. The\r\nparadox became patent when Yüan forced the advance adoption of the\r\nprovisions relating to the presidency; on October 10, 1913, the Assembly\r\nelected him president of the Republic. This gave him full _de jure_\r\nstatus as head of the Chinese state in the eyes of the foreign powers.\r\nOn November 4 Yüan suppressed the party which had created the Republic,\r\nthe Kuomintang. This not only eliminated serious opposition to him but\r\nparalyzed the Assembly as well. It was left without a quorum and without\r\na constitution under which a new Assembly could be elected--one of the\r\nmost surprising constitutional cul-de-sacs in modern times. The\r\ndictatorship began.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Presidential Dictatorship of Yüan Shih-k'ai_\r\n\r\nNot content with having immobilized the National Assembly, Yüan\r\nproceeded to kill it. He called together an extraconstitutional body of\r\nhis supporters, known as the Political Council. It recommended two\r\nmeasures: the dissolution of the National Assembly and the calling of a\r\nConstitutional Council to frame a permanent constitution. On January 10,\r\n1914, Yüan suspended the Assembly by presidential decree. With that day\r\nthe Chinese Republic ceased to have a government consonant with its\r\nlaws. Technically the whole Republic lapsed into unconstitutionality and\r\nillegality, until it was swept out of existence by the National\r\nGovernment in 1928.[6] Nevertheless, the military leaders had sufficient\r\nbelief in the political value of twentieth century formalities to\r\npreserve the appearance of constitutional procedure. During the\r\nfollowing months Yüan's Constitutional Council, which succeeded the\r\nPolitical Council and was, similarly, made up of persons favorable to\r\nhis rule, labored over another constitutional document. On May 1, 1914,\r\nthe document was promulgated under the name _Constitutional Compact_.\r\nThe Compact changed the style of Yüan's rule from a nominal\r\nparliamentarism to presidential government, and legitimatized the\r\ndictatorship.\r\n\r\nTwo and a half years after the establishment of the Republic, the\r\ncountry had grown accustomed to the rule of Yüan. His government had the\r\nadvantage of carrying on from the seat of the former imperial\r\nadministration. Yüan's peculiar faculties of old-school diplomacy and\r\nhis grasp of modern militarism stood him in good stead. The Republic was\r\ngenerally admitted to be not much of a democracy, but even democratic\r\nWesterners applauded the hard-headed competence of the \"strong man of\r\nChina.\" Government was more efficient and more despotic than it had been\r\nin the last days of the Manchu dynasty; resistance and defiance did not\r\ntake open forms, except for the activities of Sun Yat-sen and his\r\nfollowers, who had reverted to revolutionary tactics since the outlawry\r\nof their party. Their agitation was spreading with rapidity. Yüan made\r\nthe same mistake the Republicans had made before: he failed to sink the\r\nroots of government into the minds of the people and to provide a\r\ncoherent explanation for his own existence. Underestimating the change\r\nwhich had taken place, Yüan sustained the illusion that the Chinese\r\nsociety in which he was reared still existed. While he failed to evolve\r\na symbolism emphasizing the rise of a new order with him as the head,\r\nthe realization that the old Empire was gone was allowed to spread\r\nslowly across China. There was no more throne; the child Emperor dwelt\r\nquietly in his museum.\r\n\r\nIn 1915 Yüan embarked upon one of the strangest exploits in modern\r\nChinese politics. After prostituting the democratic formulas in\r\naccordance with which he professed to govern, he began to use the same\r\nformulas for a cautious approach to the creation of a new monarchy. He\r\nwas partly encouraged by a memorandum presented to him on August 9,\r\n1915, by his constitutional adviser, Professor Frank Goodnow. The\r\nmemorandum suggested, as a sane political theorem, the desirability of\r\nestablishing a constitutional monarchy _if_ there was general demand for\r\nit rather than of maintaining the trappings of Republicanism without\r\noperative democracy. But Yüan's scheming met with strong opposition.\r\nBoth sides to the ensuing monarchical controversy misconstrued Professor\r\nGoodnow's memorandum; Yüan's foes denounced it even as a recommendation\r\nfor autocracy. Seen from a purely institutional point of view, there was\r\nno harm in the proposal. A disadvantage might lie in the fact that other\r\nmilitary leaders would be jealous of Yüan's obtaining the throne on\r\nwhich so many of them speculated. If the state of mind of the Chinese\r\nand the new doctrines of the Republicans are considered, the proposal\r\nbecomes less feasible. Having gone through the terrific mental and moral\r\njolt of a fundamental shift of living forms, and having realized that\r\nthe Empire was irrecoverable, substantial sections of the population\r\nwere in no mood to allow an untried Republic to be superseded by an even\r\nless tried modern military monarchy.\r\n\r\nYüan used Japan's Twenty-one Demands of 1915, which might have made\r\nChina a quasi protectorate of Japan, as an argument for the immediate\r\nnecessity of strengthening the central government. In sponsoring the\r\nmovement for monarchy he virtually copied the procedure of Napoleon III\r\nin establishing the Second Empire. The whole technique of modern\r\nusurpation was brought into play, and no one stopped to consider who\r\nmight be impressed by it. The only audience which might have taken at\r\ntheir face value Yüan's carefully staged \"popular demonstrations\" and\r\nhis recommendations for \"representative\" public bodies was the Western\r\npublic outside. Chinese familiar enough with elections to understand\r\ntheir meaning were for a Republic; the Chinese who did not understand\r\nthem were not impressed.\r\n\r\nHad China possessed a man with the administrative and military talents\r\nof George Washington, a genuine republic might have developed from\r\nbeneath the tutelage of a strong military ruler. Sun Yat-sen, because of\r\nhis Southern birth, his thoroughly revolutionary tenets, and his\r\nimpatience with the jobbery of petty politics, was not prepared for the\r\npresidential office in Peking. He might have headed a revolutionary\r\ngovernment elsewhere in China but not a carry-over administration in\r\nPeking. Yüan misjudged his own opportunities and went back to the ritual\r\nof the Empire in an endeavor to place himself on a widely coveted\r\nthrone. In December, 1915, after a circus of plebiscites and\r\nconstitutional councils had been provided, the constitutional monarchy\r\nwas proclaimed. In the same month Yüan performed the ancient ceremonials\r\nof the Imperial Sacrifice to Heaven, clad in the traditional gowns of\r\nthe emperor. On Christmas Day, 1915, the province of Yünnan--in the\r\nextreme southwest of China--revolted against Yüan. The revolt spread,\r\nand in March, 1916, Yüan renounced the throne. His dream had come to a\r\ndismal end; he died on June 6, 1916. In the same month Vice-President Li\r\nYüan-hung--the imperial officer whose political career began when he was\r\ndragged from beneath his bed in 1911--assumed the title of president.\r\nThe National Assembly was convoked. The Provisional Constitution was put\r\ninto effect again. And, as a sign of the times, the provincial military\r\ncommanders took the new title _tuchün_ in place of the older version\r\n_tutu_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Phantom Republic in Peking_\r\n\r\nWhen the Manchu Empire fell in 1911-1912, it left the military power to\r\nYüan Shih-k'ai, who cloaked it with the Republic which he appropriated.\r\nWhen Yüan died, control of the armies passed to the provincial military\r\ncommandants whom he had installed as a prime feature of his \"strong man\"\r\nregime. With the passing of the Empire, civilian bureaucracy fell into\r\ndisuse yet retained just enough cohesion to serve the purposes of Yüan,\r\nso far as they were to be served by government. After Yüan's death, the\r\ngovernments in the provinces followed the flow of power--to the\r\nprovincial commanders. The Indian summer of the parliamentary Republic\r\nwas founded upon its toleration of the army system which Yüan had left\r\nstanding in its fragments. The weight of power was now to go into these\r\nfragments and not into the Republic, which fell heir merely to Yüan's\r\nnaive and almost contemptuously conceived \"constitutional\" show.\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen was favorable to the newly restored Republic but did not\r\nparticipate in it, since it was made up largely of second-string\r\nrevolutionists--men who had joined when the cause was winning in\r\n1911--with a sprinkling of his own followers, together with a\r\nsubstantial cohort of the new-style military. Sun had been in exile in\r\nJapan during Yüan's regime, sounding out the possibility of Japanese\r\nassistance in furthering his movement. Without the participation of any\r\ngroup competent to attract ideological support to civilian government,\r\nand without any one military leader able to serve or master its cause,\r\nthe Republic had to rest upon the administrative structure. Its power\r\nwas virtually nil. The legislative, as in the early days of the\r\nRepublic, was dominated by Sun's revolutionary Republicans, the\r\nexecutive by a conservative cabal of soldiers. The situation differed\r\nfrom the earlier one in that the military leader from the North, Tüan\r\nChi-jui, occupied the post of premier instead of that of president.\r\nWithin a year the fundamental contradictions in the regime displayed\r\nthemselves. Tüan quarreled with the President and the Assembly,\r\ndemanding dissolution of the latter. Not obtaining what he wished, he\r\njoined in 1917 other military chieftains in forming a provisional\r\nmilitary junta in Tientsin. The President called in for his support the\r\nmost reactionary army man of all, Chang Hsün. Chang forced the\r\ndissolution of the Assembly, the very contingency he was supposed to\r\nprevent. He capped this act by restoring the Manchu dynasty and putting\r\nthe boy ex-Emperor Hsüan T'ung back on the throne (July 1, 1917).\r\n\r\nWhile the country was startled to learn of the restoration of the\r\ndynasty, and to receive edicts by telegraph issued in the name of Hsüan\r\nT'ung, forces of opposition began to gather. The restoration lasted\r\nuntil the Northern military leaders could catch their breaths; on July\r\n12 Tüan Chi-jui marched back into Peking to prevent Chang Hsün from\r\nstealing a march on him. The unfortunate ex-Emperor was promptly deposed\r\nfor the second time. He was not to be put on a throne again until he\r\nbecame the Emperor of Manchoukuo in 1934.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture the arena was to broaden. In October, 1917, Sun Yat-sen\r\nwas elected Generalissimo of the South by the remnants of the parliament\r\nwhich had gathered in Canton. Their action was provoked largely by\r\nChina's declaration of war on Germany--a step which Sun bitterly opposed\r\nas serving no Chinese interest. From now on there were to be _two_\r\nRepublican traditions in China, each one of them with theoretical claims\r\nto the legitimate succession from the 1912-1913 Republic. The government\r\nestablished by Sun Yat-sen in the South did not secure any international\r\nrecognition, nor did it contain remnants of the imperial bureaucracy, or\r\nwin the respect of the soldiery. But it did fall heir to the ideological\r\nrevolution. The people were still skeptically indulgent toward Sun the\r\nidealist and his ramshackle governments, although they conceived of\r\ngovernment in China largely as the problem of fattening the Peking\r\nphantom and raising it to husky manhood. The Northern Republic survived\r\nuntil 1928, increasingly a puzzle and an illusion.[7]\r\n\r\nThe details of its slow death are intricate. The military did not ignore\r\nthe Republic altogether. They requested its sanction for their\r\nmanipulation of the balance of power. The Republic legitimized the\r\ngradations of military strength which grew out of conspiracy, tax\r\nexploitation, opium farming, and ineffectual war. The Republic and its\r\npresidency were the chief pawns in the pointless game of Chinese\r\nmilitarism. The Republic lent a color of unity to the country and\r\npreserved those proprieties dominant in the Chinese mind. Even banditry\r\nbecomes respectable if it observes \"political\" formalities, and at times\r\nthe line between banditry and generalship became a matter of day-to-day\r\nintentions or of the size of the armed forces at hand. The government in\r\nPeking struggled to provide a suitable organizational form for the\r\nstatus quo, though never quite catching up with the new _faits\r\naccomplis_ of each week.\r\n\r\nIn three connections the Republic of China at Peking is worthy of\r\nconsideration: in its constitutional development, which in a dreamlike\r\nand ineffectual way mirrored the political ideals of the\r\nnonrevolutionary elite;[8] in its international role, which was of\r\ngenuine importance and value to China; and in its administrative\r\naccomplishments, which--for a government--were negligible to the point\r\nof absurdity, but admirable indeed for bureaucracy working in chaos.\r\n\r\nThe Peking government was technically based on the Provisional\r\nConstitution of 1912. At the earliest period of the restored Republic\r\n(1917) it fell into the hands of the Anfu clique, which administered to\r\nChina a dose of Reconstruction on the American model. The treasury was\r\nliterally looted, and the politicos who attached themselves to the\r\ngovernment and to the military dominating it fell over each other in\r\ntheir haste to sell the nation out to Japan. A peace conference with the\r\nrepresentatives of the South met in 1919 but accomplished nothing. A new\r\nparliament was chosen from the areas claimed by Peking; when this passed\r\nout of existence another parliament stemming from the National Assembly\r\ndissolved by Yüan in 1913 assembled in 1922--a rare modern instance of a\r\nlegislative body succeeding its successors. This so-called Old\r\nParliament returned to the task which had been interrupted ten years\r\nbefore and in 1923 gave birth to a constitution.\r\n\r\nThe 1923 constitution--China's third Republican constitution, after the\r\nProvisional Constitution of 1912 and the Constitutional Compact of\r\n1914--was adopted by a body revoltingly corrupt. The constitution itself\r\nwas the work of political scientists; it was as admirable a document as\r\nJohn Locke's constitution for the colony of Carolina, although the\r\nparliament elected Ts'ao Kun president under conditions which set a\r\nrecord for indefensible practices. The constitution itself was\r\nfederalist, but with many adaptations of French institutions in so far\r\nas the central government was concerned. As a theoretical device for\r\ngovernment, it would stand high among the constitutions of the world,\r\nbut if not stillborn it was never brought to life. Within a year it was\r\nset aside, and another provisional system of government was established.\r\nA committee was set to work on a fourth constitution more strongly\r\nfederal.[9] The provisional government lasted from 1924 to 1926. In 1926\r\nChang Tso-lin, the _tuchün_ of Manchuria, took over the city of Peking\r\nand the government. In doing so he did not bother to appoint a\r\nconstitutional committee or to bribe a parliament. He appointed himself\r\ndictator (_ta yüan shuai_) and let the legalistic logicians construe it\r\nas they might. On June 5, 1928, Sun Yat-sen's armies from the South\r\noccupied Peking, and the Peking Republic was at an end. A ghost of a\r\nghost, it was to reappear as a Japanese device in 1937, at a time when\r\nconstitutional debate was at a minimum.\r\n\r\nFrom the metamorphoses of the Peking Republic the Chinese learned most\r\nbitterly the lessons of political reality. It dawned upon them that\r\ngovernment would have to rest upon foundations reaching deep into\r\nsociety and could not be superimposed upon the existing disorder. Their\r\nconstitutional experience also satiated the Chinese with Western\r\nformalism. Yet the phantom governments at Peking enjoyed the full\r\nrecognition of the Great Powers, and the Waichiaopu (Foreign Office)\r\nmaintained an impeccable diplomatic front. Although the Chinese scored\r\nno triumph at the Paris peace conference, they came off much better than\r\nthey would have done without any representation. Three years later, at\r\nthe Washington Conference, the Chinese, favored by the jealousies\r\nprevailing between the other powers, won a notable diplomatic victory.\r\nRepresenting a government whose authority scarcely reached beyond its\r\nown capital and whose limited financial resources threw its diplomatic\r\ncorps largely on their own, the members of the Chinese delegation\r\nsecured advantages for China greater than any won at the time by the\r\nSoviet Union.[10]\r\n\r\nIn the international field the Chinese owed their strength to the same\r\nfactors that weakened them at home: careful attention to form, the\r\nanxious cherishing of prestige and appearance, and a limitless patience\r\nwhich did not predispose the diplomats to violent action. Since the\r\nPeking regime, in point of military forces available for world-wide\r\naction, was on about the same level as Liberia, the fact that China\r\nremained a second-rate power instead of becoming a plain victim suggests\r\nthe degree of her international prestige. The Peking government provided\r\na background, however shadowy, for the Chinese Foreign Office, and the\r\nForeign Office carefully nursed the fictions of China's international\r\nstatus. Moreover, some domestic machinery remained. Around the Peking\r\ngovernment there clustered a group of administrations which were so\r\npurely bureaucratic and non-policy-making in character that they were\r\ntolerated even by the military, or else were under the protection of\r\ninternational agreements. The Maritime Customs in Shanghai was staffed\r\nin its key positions with Westerners. This feature arose out of\r\nconditions during the T'ai-p'ing rebellion; it was later given\r\ninternational status by Chinese assurances that under certain\r\nstipulations the customs were to retain their foreign personnel. The\r\nautonomy of the customs became a striking characteristic of the\r\ninternational legal and financial position of China, since most of the\r\nChinese debts were secured by a mortgage on customs receipts.[11] The\r\nSalt Revenue Administration was similarly separated from the rest of the\r\nChinese bureaucracy by international agreement, since loans had been\r\nsecured upon this revenue. The surpluses from both services were paid\r\nfor the greater part to the central government at Peking and provided a\r\ndefinite fiscal incentive for the maintenance of the Republic. The\r\nChinese Post Office was also manned in part by Westerners, and it\r\nmanaged to preserve reasonably good postal service throughout the\r\ncountry despite the governmental anarchy which otherwise prevailed.\r\nThese administrations were largely autonomous; they made up the\r\ndeficiencies of the Peking government so far as it was within their\r\npower. Thus the regime could boast of an excellent written constitution,\r\na first-class Foreign Office, several good revenue agencies, a good\r\npostal service, and almost nothing else.\r\n\r\nIn the age of the _tuchüns_ the Peking regime had no domestic power to\r\nspeak of; most of the time government was by courtesy only.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Governments of Sun Yat-sen in Canton_\r\n\r\nIn 1917, when the National Assembly was dissolved for the second time by\r\nthe intervention of the _tuchün_ Chang Hsün, a group of its members met\r\nfirst in Shanghai and then adjourned to Canton. Assembling as an\r\nExtraordinary Parliament, it elected Sun Yat-sen Generalissimo of the\r\nSouth. He was not given the title of president because he did not wish\r\nto create the appearance of national disunity. Sun was in the peculiar\r\nposition of being placed in military command at the sufferance of\r\nregional military leaders. He even had to fight for support in the rump\r\nparliament which had elected him.\r\n\r\nIn this first Cantonese government, Sun's military objectives\r\novershadowed all others. Attempts were made to promote a frontal assault\r\non the army plague, and various expeditions were launched against the\r\nNorth. Sun Yat-sen had his experiences in the years of revolt before\r\n1911 to hearten him. The Republican Revolution of 1911-1912 was not so\r\nmuch a carefully timed universal conspiracy as it was the seizure of a\r\nfew pivotal points by small bands of revolutionists, backed by\r\nprovincial support. Sun did not think in terms of nationalism as yet,\r\nfor he felt that with the expulsion of the Manchus the Chinese had\r\nsolved the major problem of foreign oppression. His course of action in\r\nthe first Cantonese government was therefore that of a man fighting on a\r\nconstitutional and democratic issue while leaning on a temporary\r\nmilitary government. His new regime had acquired at one time an enormous\r\nreach of territory by bringing under its fold, through a process of\r\nnegotiation and intrigue, the leading military figures of Southern\r\nChina.\r\n\r\nSun was, however, working too much outside his own party. He had both\r\nthe parliament and the Southern militarists to contend with. The task of\r\nmaintaining a revolutionary movement with troops who were no more\r\ninterested in it than the troops opposing them, transcended even Sun's\r\noptimism and courage. Despite demonstrations of his personal capacity\r\nand bravery, he felt that his work lacked momentum. In May, 1918, after\r\nhis office as generalissimo had been abolished and he had been made one\r\nof a Supreme Committee of Seven, Sun left for Shanghai.\r\n\r\nIn Shanghai Sun had time to ponder organizational strategy, to conduct\r\nthe world-wide operations of the Kuomintang officially now _Chung-hua\r\nKê-ming Tang_, or Chinese Revolutionary Party, and to consider types of\r\ngovernment and methods of propaganda. He worked with Judge Paul\r\nLinebarger, his sympathizer and supporter since 1906, on a biography\r\nsimilar to the campaign biographies of American presidential\r\ncandidates.[12] At this time he was still devoting himself to the\r\norganization of the existing groups in Chinese society for revolutionary\r\npurposes. He saw himself as the moral leader of the revolution and\r\nsimultaneously as the necessary advocate of constitutionalism. He was\r\nanxious to implement the ideological revolution but thought that the\r\nparliamentary democratic techniques had been designed in the West to\r\naccomplish just that end. While he was in Shanghai, the Canton regime\r\ncarried on a fragmentary existence. In November, 1920, he returned to\r\nCanton after his military friends had cleared the way for him. On this\r\noccasion the Canton government came forth as a fully civilian regime.\r\nSun was elected Extraordinary President of the Republic of China by the\r\nSouthern parliament in April, 1921. Using the city of Canton as his\r\nbase, Sun continued the long series of military expeditions he had led\r\nfor years, trying to whip the _tuchüns_ at their own game without\r\nbecoming one himself. He personally went with forces into the field\r\nagain. In 1922 treason on the part of his chief war-lord supporter drove\r\nhim out of Canton. Back in Shanghai, he established contact with the\r\nrepresentative of the Soviets, Adolf Joffe; both men stipulated the\r\nterms of the alliance between the Kuomintang and the Communists.[13]\r\n\r\nIn 1923 Sun laid new emphasis on one part of his program hitherto\r\nneglected: the doctrine of the three stages of revolution. The\r\nrevolution had failed in fact because it had not provided adequate\r\nmeasures for democratic training. The revolutionists had assumed an\r\norganic political change, and militarists had profited by their mistake\r\nin taking over the Republic and using its forms to subvert what were the\r\nmerest beginnings of democracy. Henceforth, the revolutionary group\r\nwould have to emphasize a sequential process in democratic state\r\nconstruction: (1) the acquisition of political power by the missionaries\r\nof the revolution; (2) the teaching of the new ideology of democracy and\r\nthe training of the people in the techniques of self-government; (3) the\r\nestablishment of constitutional democracy.[14] When offered the\r\nopportunity of forming his third Canton government, he took no chances\r\nand himself assumed the title generalissimo and the command of the\r\narmies. In October, 1923, a plan was drawn up for the reorganization of\r\nthe Kuomintang, with the advice of Borodin. Next January the First\r\nCongress of the Party opened. Sun Yat-sen, delighted with the new\r\ninstrument for promoting the ideological revolution, allowed government\r\nproblems to recede. The Party came to the front, and with the Party\r\norganization were to be solved the problems of a universe in revolution.\r\nDuring the fifteen months of life which remained to Sun Yat-sen, his\r\nthird government at Canton was not to undergo any transformation. The\r\nstrictly political purposes of the revolution had become mere adjuncts\r\nto the ideological and military features. The government continued to\r\npossess the now familiar parliamentary-democratic formulas which,\r\nmisused and deformed as they were throughout China, had come to be the\r\nembroidery of might.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Nationalist Government, Soviet in Form_\r\n\r\nThe sorry picture of inadequacy in both the North and the South was\r\ninterrupted by the launching of the Nationalist Revolution of 1926-1927.\r\nAs a preparatory step to the acquisition of revolutionary power, Sun\r\nYat-sen's followers reorganized the Canton government in June, 1925.\r\nThis action followed Sun's death on March 11, 1925, in Peking, where he\r\nhad gone to take part in a reunification conference with the leading\r\n_tuchüns_ of the North. The conference had failed, but it is\r\ncharacteristic that Sun, embittered though he was, lent his last hours\r\nto formulating a compromise. The new Canton government took the name of\r\n_The Nationalist Government of China_, thereby disavowing succession\r\nfrom the ineffectual Republic which preceded it. It remained in Canton\r\nuntil the end of 1926; on January 1, 1927, it was transferred to Hankow,\r\nthe greatest inland city of China, located some six hundred miles up the\r\nYangtze River from Shanghai. Hankow is one of three sister cities\r\ncollectively termed the Wu-han cities; hence this phase of the\r\nNationalist Government is referred to as the Wu-han regime. It came to\r\nan end in the fall of 1927, enjoyed a momentary resurrection in Canton,\r\nand then passed into history, being succeeded by another Nationalist\r\nGovernment at Nanking.\r\n\r\nIn the last two years of his life, Sun had come to stress again his\r\nprinciple of nationalism. After the birth of the 1912 Republic he had\r\nfor some years placed in the foreground democracy and _min shêng_, until\r\nhe became aware that the problem of China's internal reconstruction\r\ncould not be solved without an adequate adjustment of foreign relations.\r\nHe saw that the _tuchün_ wars were influenced by competing imperialisms,\r\nagreed upon resistance to the Chinese revolution while expressing pious\r\nhopes for Chinese unity. Accordingly, the Kuomintang began emphasizing\r\nits nationalist character, and Sun's followers, previously termed\r\nRepublicans or merely revolutionaries, were called Nationalists. With a\r\nprogram of anti-imperialism, anti-_tuchünism_, and national unification,\r\nthe Party began making great headway. The propaganda machinery which the\r\nRussian advisers had devised was turned against the vested interests. In\r\naddition, the rapid rise of the Nationalists must be explained through\r\ntheir party organization and the creation of agencies linked with the\r\nParty, such as youth groups, labor unions, peasant unions, and women's\r\nassociations. Thus, instead of trying to superimpose a modern government\r\nupon preexisting social forms, the Nationalists built their government\r\nby molding the social groups necessary to its support.\r\n\r\nThe government was composed of a hierarchy of committees, similar to the\r\nSoviet system in Russia. The topmost committees of the government were\r\nsubject to the control of the Central Executive Committee of the Party.\r\nThe Party secured its authority through a policy of democratic\r\ncentralism buttressed by the election of a Party Congress from the\r\nvarious branches of the party. Power thus followed a perfectly clear and\r\ntraceable line; it did not depend upon mock elections or upon indefinite\r\ndelegations of authority. The party members elected the delegates to the\r\nParty Congress; the Party Congress chose a Central Executive Committee;\r\nthe Central Executive Committee or its Standing Committee controlled the\r\nPolitical Council (policy-making) and the Administrative Council\r\n(cabinet), together with the Military Council. These three were the\r\nsupreme government agencies. The same party authorities appointed and\r\nremoved all members of all other councils in provincial or municipal\r\ngovernments. There was not the faintest show of popular participation in\r\nthe government; government had become the exclusive tool of the Party.\r\nBut by being admittedly a tool, the government possessed definite power.\r\n\r\nParty agencies opened wide the doors of mass participation, not in the\r\ngovernment but in the movement. The Nationalist Revolution won with the\r\nassistance of the Communists in 1926-1927 rested on the extension of\r\nevery conceivable agitational device to every group of the population.\r\nThe government tied these devices together. Halfway on the road to\r\nvictory the differences between the Right and Left Kuomintang, and\r\nbetween the Communists and the Kuomintang, became too acute to allow for\r\nfurther operation. In April, 1927, Chiang K'ai-shek, the Nationalist\r\nGeneralissimo, established a Nationalist Government at Nanking. The\r\nNationalist Government, soviet in form, remained in Hankow for a few\r\nmore months, transferred again to Canton, and then expired. Even so, the\r\ncouncils of the Nationalist governments at Canton and Wu-han had served\r\ntheir purpose well; they had effected the concentration of power,\r\ninstead of its division, in the course of a revolution when\r\nconcentration was at a premium. With the approaching victory and peace,\r\nthe council form of government began to appear to the Chinese as no less\r\nalien than parliamentarism. The Nanking government set out to\r\nreconstitute a government both Chinese and modern.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] Sun Yat-sen, _How China Was Made a Republic_ (unpublished\r\nmanuscript written in Shanghai in 1919, now in possession of the present\r\nauthor), p. 40.\r\n\r\n[2] See above, pp. 43 ff.\r\n\r\n[3] Wu Chih-fang, _Chinese Government and Politics_, p. 361, Shanghai,\r\n1934.

Chiang K'ai-shek had to\r\nresign from the government before the Left Kuomintang group would accept\r\nthe regime. In the following year, with the return of Chiang and the\r\nadoption of a new constitution (Organic Law of the National Government),\r\nthe Nanking government was more firmly established than any previous\r\ngovernment since the death of Yüan Shih-k'ai. A high price had been paid\r\nfor stability: Northern military leaders had been allowed to join it,\r\nmuch as those of the South had supported Sun Yat-sen ten years before.\r\nThe break with the Communists meant stopping a vast agrarian-proletarian\r\nrevolution midway in its course, at a cost of many lives. The\r\nNationalists, thrust into the role of governors, could not avoid turning\r\nagainst many of those who had helped to put them in power but wished to\r\ncontinue the revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The National Government of China_\r\n\r\nDespite the difficulties which it faced, the National Government had\r\nmany assets. In the realm of ideology, it had the advantage of\r\npossessing a state philosophy and a patron saint: the _San Min Chu I_[1]\r\nand its author, Sun Yat-sen. In the military sphere, it had at its\r\ndisposal an army unequaled in China; in the economic, the support of the\r\nChinese bourgeoisie, together with the friendly interest of the\r\ncapitalist powers. In the province of politics, it carried with it much\r\nof the personnel formerly serving the Nationalist Government, soviet in\r\nform, to which it claimed succession. Its officials were accustomed to\r\ndevote themselves seriously to government, so that from the very\r\nbeginning the Nanking government was inclined to enforce its laws as\r\nwell as promulgate them--thereby breaking with the usage of the shadow\r\nRepublic at Peking. Finally, the new government secured full\r\ninternational recognition with the flight of Chang Tso-lin from Peking\r\nand the disappearance of the rival regime in the North (1928).\r\n\r\nSun's state philosophy fulfilled a cardinal function. Even in its most\r\ntroubled phases, when military factors came closest to the surface of\r\ngovernment, the new government did not lapse into fiction. There was a\r\nprogrammatic index against which Nanking's accomplishments could be\r\ntested, and a definite long-range plan to follow. The program enabled\r\nthe National Government to utilize the forms of revolution for the\r\npurpose of stabilizing government--far less dangerous than the practice\r\nof their Northern predecessors, to use government in order to further\r\ndisunited military despotism. The officers of the Kuomintang exhibited a\r\nmeticulous respect for the dead Leader of their Party. Sun Yat-sen,\r\nknown by his honorific pseudonym _Chung Shan_, was buried in one of the\r\nmost magnificent tombs of modern times. In carrying out Sun's legacy,\r\nthe Kuomintang was pledged to the principles of intraparty democratic\r\ncentralism and party dictatorship over the rest of the nation. The\r\nformal party organization was not seriously effected by the change from\r\na soviet form of government.\r\n\r\nGovernment under the Kuomintang, despite the breakdown of morale which\r\nfollowed the disintegration of the Great Revolution (1927), was\r\nradically unlike that of the Peking regimes. In 1927, when Chiang\r\nK'ai-shek turned against the peasant unions and officialized the labor\r\nunions, a tendency toward outright military dictatorship became\r\napparent. The developments of the following ten years did not at any\r\ntime suggest that military power had meekly yielded to governmental\r\npower, but they did indicate that government was taking an increasing\r\npart in the control of society. The close interrelation of ideology and\r\ngovernment, dating from the period of the Nationalist-Communist\r\nalliance, was to endure after the revolution had been transformed into a\r\nreconstructive process and rebellion had been superseded by\r\nadministration. However much Sun and his teachings failed to create a\r\nnew political Islam, they weathered criticism sufficiently well to\r\nprovide a scheme of policy, political values, and broad objectives.\r\n\r\nThe influence of Sun Yat-sen was harmed, rather than reinforced, by the\r\nhysterical ritualists who seem to be the parasites of all one-party\r\ngovernments. The memory of the Leader and his teachings settled into the\r\nstabilizing roles of founding father and general dogma. Only a few\r\nveterans of the movement are still inspired by the fire of his words and\r\nthe vigor of his personality. To the vast bulk of Chinese public opinion\r\nSun Yat-sen is the human embodiment of virtuous, brave, and intelligent\r\nconduct, whose theories are acceptable in their general form and whose\r\nprograms have proved pragmatically usable. The _San Min Chu I_ failed to\r\ncause widespread political ecstasy; it succeeded in bringing direction\r\nand sanity, after a limited fashion. To spread allegiance the government\r\nfostered a Sun Yat-sen memorial ritual; every Monday morning, in every\r\ngovernment office, college, school, police station, and other public\r\nbuilding, there was held a service consisting of the reading of Sun\r\nYat-sen's political testament and passages from his speeches clarifying\r\nhis doctrines. The services seemed for a while to resemble a state\r\nreligion; but the moderateness and formalism of Chinese life was\r\ninimical to the fervor necessary for political religion. The Kuomintang\r\nand its government came to see these limitations; although the services\r\nhave remained, they are now severely secular in spirit.\r\n\r\nThe most dynamic part of the _San Min Chu I_, the doctrine of\r\nnationalism, had contributed to placing the Kuomintang in power. The new\r\ngovernment was accordingly nationalist and centralistic; it opposed any\r\ntype of regionalism--political, administrative, economic, or military.\r\nThe Northern generals who sided with the government at the time of its\r\nformation were brought within the operation of the national military\r\nlaws. When they revolted--quite properly, according to their _tuchün_\r\nstandards--against reduction of their forces in the Disbandment War of\r\n1930-1931, they were defeated. With the Southern and the Western\r\nmilitary leaders Chiang was not as successful, until Japanese and\r\nCommunist pressure brought first the one and then the other group into\r\nhis fold. After actual autonomy for a number of years, the province of\r\nKuangtung (Canton) submitted in 1936 to the authority of the National\r\nGovernment, thereby bringing to an end the generation-old division of\r\nNorth and South. Nationalism and centralism affected not only the armies\r\nbut also the entire administration, whose service functions and police\r\npowers developed amazingly. Although the Nanking government had\r\noriginally faced broad popular suspicion, it began to win genuine\r\nrespect because of its accomplishments.\r\n\r\nWas the Nanking government a dictatorship? Its record does not justify\r\nthe assumption that it was merely to camouflage a military dictatorship\r\ncommandeered by Chiang K'ai-shek. Moreover, the policy-making power was\r\nnot by any means a prerogative of Chiang K'ai-shek. Chiang was nearly\r\nsovereign in technical military matters and possessed more political\r\ninfluence than did any other single individual. Yet the power of policy\r\nmaking rested with a small group of men not over a hundred in number.\r\nSome of the gentlest, sincerest, and quietest of these leaders had once\r\nbeen _tuchüns_ in their own right; some of the most military and\r\nforthright had never handled anything more lethal than a cash register.\r\nThe leaders tended to work within the party and government structure, so\r\nthat the political organization, while not of great simplicity or\r\nclarity, accurately portrayed the distribution of power. No one can\r\ngauge the degree of interdependence between the leaders of a government\r\nsystem in its formative period, and between the offices which these\r\nleaders occupy. The Sian episode indicated that the Nanking government\r\ncould continue without Chiang and that Chiang's incarceration was not\r\nthe signal for immediate anarchy. But Chiang was not actually dead, nor\r\nwas the government deprived of the support which his prestige had\r\ngenerated. From 1927 to 1937 the Nanking government remained under\r\napproximately the same leading officials.\r\n\r\nThe last test for the sources of Nanking's power may be found in\r\nconsidering the relation between the men in command and the authority\r\nwhich placed them there. The supreme organ of the party was the Party\r\nCongress. This body did determine the course of government policy\r\nfrequently, and on such occasions clarified issues through action. The\r\nCongress elected the Central Executive Committee and the Central\r\nSupervisory Committee of the Kuomintang. The entire membership of the\r\nCongress would vote in the elections, any of the members being eligible.\r\nSince the Congress was composed of representatives from the various\r\nregional and functional divisions of the party, intraparty democracy was\r\ninsured in theory and--though to a lesser extent--in practice. The two\r\ntop committees elected smaller Standing Committees; the Central\r\nExecutive Committee in addition elected the Central Political Council,\r\nwhich was the highest organ of government in China and the agency\r\nthrough which the party controlled the government. The Central Political\r\nCouncil did not seek to keep track of the detail of government; it\r\noutlined governmental policy, appointed major officials, and directed\r\nrather than supervised administration. It was a policy-making body in\r\nthe strictest sense, and its action took effect upon the Council of\r\nState, which coordinated the government establishments.[2]\r\n\r\nHad there been a schism between the Nanking government and the\r\nKuomintang, it might have been possible to trace a political issue as it\r\nwas fought out--all the way from the party membership up through the\r\nParty Congress and the Central Executive Committee, from party to\r\ngovernment by action of the Central Political Council, and down through\r\nthe Council of State and the subordinated government organs to the\r\nadministrative network operating upon the broad masses of the populace.\r\nIn fact, however, no issue saw the light, since the same group that\r\ndominated the party controlled the government. The relation between the\r\nleaders and the Party Congresses can perhaps best be compared with that\r\nbetween the leading personalities of a Republican or Democratic\r\nconvention in the United States and the convention delegates. Convention\r\naction rarely transfers power or upsets leadership, nor do constructive\r\nplans or formulated policies emerge from convention sessions; and yet\r\nthe conventions cannot be regarded merely as tools in the hands of the\r\nparty leadership. A similar situation existed in China. Even when Chiang\r\nand the other leaders seemed to hold the bag, the meetings of the Party\r\nCongress did not lack importance, and the issues before the Congress\r\nwere not considered predetermined. This was no personal regime in the\r\nNapoleonic sense. Party dictatorship expressed itself in defined forms,\r\nas a part of Sun Yat-sen's state philosophy. Benevolent oligarchy of\r\npatriotic modernists, acting with party sanction obtained through\r\nintraparty democratic processes, was not foreign to Sun's mind. The\r\nNanking government further differed from fascist governments, and\r\nresembled the Russian, in that it was democratic in intent; its\r\ndictatorial character was avowedly temporary. Throughout the period\r\nduring which the Kuomintang ruled from Nanking, democracy was regarded\r\nas a definite goal of governmental policy. The Japanese invasions\r\nculminating in open war made impossible the immediate abrogation of\r\nKuomintang party dictatorship. Yet when war broke out in 1937, the\r\nNational Government was on the verge of reconstituting itself as a\r\ndemocracy; but now the regime itself became itinerant, moving into the\r\nhinterland.\r\n\r\nThe Nanking government was organized under Kuomintang rule in a form\r\nunique among modern states. Its three most distinctive features were:\r\n(1) the concentration of power in the supreme agencies; (2) a fivefold\r\ndivision of power and function through the _yüans_; and (3) the absence\r\nof parliamentary chambers.[3] While the Organic Law was in effect as a\r\nconstitution (1928-1931), the government was headed by a president\r\nwielding considerable power and a Council of State which served as the\r\nchief control agency. In 1931 a National People's Convention made up of\r\nrepresentatives of the Kuomintang and of occupational groups adopted a\r\nProvisional Constitution.[4] Under this constitution the power of the\r\npresident was sharply reduced, making him practically a titular officer.\r\nThe Council of State became a more formalized agency, and the greater\r\nweight of government routine was placed in the Executive _Yüan_. Under\r\nthe draft constitution proposed for the period after the end of party\r\ndictatorship a presidential system was to have been inaugurated.\r\n\r\nThe years 1931-1937 were characterized by the use of the Council of\r\nState as the supreme agency of formal government. The president of the\r\nNational Government was little more than the chairman of the Council.\r\nThe Council received instructions from the Central Political Council,\r\nand transmitted them to the five regular departments of government in\r\nthe form of policies. Great as its powers may seem to be, the Council of\r\nState was largely an intermediary agency, although the personal\r\ninfluence of its members was extensive. The Council, with its\r\nadministrative adjuncts, was of value in that it provided an\r\ninstitutional center for the government and gave governmental form to\r\nthe commands of the party. There was no judicial check on the executive\r\nor the legislative branches.\r\n\r\nThe fivefold division of powers (adopted as the _yüan_ system) is one of\r\nthe most original points in Sun Yat-sen's political scheme. _Yüan_ is an\r\nalmost untranslatable Chinese term signifying a \"public body\" and used\r\nin modern China to designate the five great coordinate departments of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PARTY MEMBERSHIP\r\n\r\n  PARTY CONGRESS\r\n\r\n  CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE  CENTRAL SUPERVISORY COMMITTEE\r\n      STANDING COMMITTEE           STANDING COMMITTEE\r\n\r\n  CENTRAL POLITICAL COUNCIL\r\n\r\n  1.

The yüan\r\nincluded all the major executive ministries, and the formal meeting of\r\nthe Executive _Yüan_ was a meeting of the _Yüan_ officers, the heads of\r\nthe ministries, and other directing officials. Such meetings took place\r\nonce a week and corresponded to cabinet meetings in Western countries.\r\nThe executive work of the entire government was performed by the\r\nExecutive _Yüan_ and--through characteristic Chinese devices--the _Yüan_\r\nSecretariat, divided into bureaus and committees, came to occupy a\r\nposition of high strategic importance in Chinese government. All\r\nexecutive measures were funneled through the Secretariat, which cast\r\nthem into proper form and determined whether or not they should be put\r\non the _yüan_ agenda. It thus occupied a position not unlike that of the\r\nGrand Chancery and Grand Secretariat of the T'ang dynasty or of the\r\nOffice of Transmissions under the Manchus. The Executive _Yüan_ combined\r\nwithin itself nine ministries: Interior (having charge of provincial and\r\nlocal government), Foreign Affairs, Military Affairs, Navy, Finance,\r\nIndustries, Education, Communications, and Railways. Included were also\r\na number of special commissions and agencies.\r\n\r\nThe Legislative _Yüan_ consisted of a president, a vice-president, and\r\neighty-six members, with an extensive administrative staff attached to\r\nit. The _yüan_ was divided, as are parliaments, into committees, but it\r\nwas not a representative body, nor able to enact laws independently of\r\nthe other divisions of government. Its president's powers were so wide\r\nas to make the cameral organization of the _yüan_ more apparent than\r\nreal and to reduce the _yüan_ to a legislative drafting and research\r\nagency. The Judicial _Yüan_ was made up of four establishments: Supreme\r\nCourt, Administrative Court, Commission for the Disciplinary Punishment\r\nof Public Functionaries (dealing with the government personnel below\r\npolitical rank), and the Ministry of Justice. The Examination _Yüan_,\r\ncomposed of two divisions (Examination Commission and Ministry of\r\nPersonnel) gave expression to the Chinese tradition of separate\r\nexamining agencies. Its function was to provide a merit system\r\napplicable to the whole government staff, except those relatively few\r\npositions which were political in nature. Because of the difficulty of\r\ndeveloping elaborate machinery under unusual circumstances, the\r\nExamination _Yüan_ did not establish for itself a high standard of\r\naccomplishment. Finally, the Control _Yüan_ served as a chamber of\r\ncensors entitled to bring suit against dishonest or treacherous\r\nofficials, and maintained a central Ministry of Audit. In the last few\r\nyears of the Nanking regime it brought over two hundred and fifty cases\r\nto bar each year.\r\n\r\nAn informative picture of the practical workings of one of the key parts\r\nof the National Government, the Secretariat of the Executive _Yüan_, is\r\ngiven by Tsiang Ting-fu, the Chinese ambassador to the Soviet Union and\r\nformerly one of the ranking officials of that _Yüan_:\r\n\r\n  The Bureau of General Affairs keeps the internal machinery of the\r\n  Secretariat going. It receives the dispatches and distributes them\r\n  among the sections. It manages the funds and looks after supplies.\r\n\r\n  The Bureau of Confidential Affairs handles confidential telegrams and\r\n  keeps the secret codes.\r\n\r\n  The Secretaries in the Drafting Bureau draft documents that require\r\n  high literary finish, usually formal documents.\r\n\r\n  The Reception Bureau takes care of callers and visitors and sees to it\r\n  that dignitaries who come to the Executive Yüan for business or\r\n  courtesy calls are accorded a due reception.\r\n\r\n  The Meetings Bureau arranges for all meetings held in, or under the\r\n  auspices of, the Executive Yüan.\r\n\r\n  The Compilation and Translation Bureau watches over the periodical\r\n  press, both Chinese and foreign.\r\n\r\n  The real political work is done in the Sections. Let us take up first\r\n  political correspondence. A minister, governor, or mayor sends a\r\n  dispatch to the Executive Yüan, asking for instructions in regard to,\r\n  let us say, a problem in raising funds. It goes to Section 5. The head\r\n  clerk and his assistants look up regulations, precedents, and other\r\n  relevant facts and write a memorandum. The dispatch with the\r\n  memorandum goes to the secretary or councillor in charge of the\r\n  Section, who writes a minute suggesting a solution or approving a\r\n  solution suggested by the head clerk. Then the dispatch, memorandum,\r\n  and minute go to the Director of Political Affairs, who, taking into\r\n  consideration political factors, renders a tentative decision for\r\n  final approval by the Secretary-General. The clerical staff sticks to\r\n  law, tradition, and precedent. Adjustments are usually made only by\r\n  the ranks above. As the majority of problems are so-called routine\r\n  problems, in connection with which the opinion of the clerical staff\r\n  is usually sound, the ranks above usually accept the proposed\r\n  solution. What is important and bothersome is the minority of unusual\r\n  problems, for the treatment of which procedures are varied.\r\n\r\n  The sender of a dispatch dealing with an unusual problem may call, or\r\n  send a representative to call, on the Secretary-General or the\r\n  Director of Political Affairs before or simultaneously with the\r\n  sending of the dispatch, giving a personal detailed explanation of the\r\n  matter and sounding the opinion of the Executive Yüan as represented\r\n  by the Secretary-General and the Director of Political Affairs. An\r\n  agreed solution may be arrived at during the interview. In that case\r\n  the correspondence will be only formal. But the parties involved may\r\n  disagree, in which case the Secretary-General will courteously say\r\n  that the matter must be referred to the President or to the Yüan\r\n  meeting, and the Director has an additional solution of the problem by\r\n  resorting to consultation with the Secretary-General. In some cases\r\n  the Secretary-General and the Director will decide the matter during\r\n  the interview whether the caller likes it or not.\r\n\r\n  Some unusual matters touch several jurisdictions, _i.e._, two or three\r\n  ministries; or a number of provinces or cities; or both. The Executive\r\n  Yüan then calls a meeting of representatives of the jurisdictions\r\n  affected and the matter is threshed out there. The conclusions of such\r\n  meetings may be referred to the President or to the Yüan meetings.\r\n\r\n  In dealing with unusual problems of primary importance the\r\n  Secretary-General usually consults the President, and the Director of\r\n  Political Affairs consults the Secretary-General in most cases and the\r\n  President in some cases where the work is specifically assigned to the\r\n  Director by the President.\r\n\r\n  The average of dispatches (including telegrams) received and sent out\r\n  daily by the Executive Yüan is about three hundred, of which number\r\n  only two or three need to be referred to the President or the Yüan\r\n  meeting, the rest being handled by the Secretariat without such\r\n  reference.\r\n\r\n  The Secretariat on its part, by the order of the President as Chairman\r\n  of the Yüan meeting, or on the initiative of the Secretary-General or\r\n  at the suggestion of the Director of Political Affairs, sends\r\n  dispatches to the ministries, commissions, provinces and\r\n  municipalities, in the form of decrees, ordinances, instructions,\r\n  inquiries and requests.\r\n\r\n  The energies of the clerical staff are devoted entirely to the\r\n  incoming and outgoing correspondence. About half of the time of the\r\n  secretaries and councillors is devoted to correspondence and half to\r\n  conferences. The sub-committees created by the Yüan meeting are\r\n  numerous and are almost always convoked by the Secretariat. In a few\r\n  cases the Secretary-General and the Director of Political Affairs,\r\n  usually accompanied by a secretary or councillor, attend; in most\r\n  cases, however a secretary or a councillor is designated as the Yüan's\r\n  representative. The conclusions of such sub-committees are always\r\n  reported back to the Yüan meeting.[5]\r\n\r\nStrange as the _yüan_ system may appear, it seems to have been the most\r\neffectual form of government that the Chinese have devised in the\r\nRepublican era. In times of military or revolutionary crisis, however,\r\nthis elaborate scheme of bureaucratic departmentalization would prove\r\ntoo cumbersome for rapid readjustment and action; during the Japanese\r\ninvasions, great reliance was placed on the creation of emergency\r\ncommissions. In addition to the _yüans_ there were a number of agencies\r\nwhich did not fit into the five-power scheme. Great independent\r\nestablishments were attached directly to the Council of State. An\r\nAcademia Sinica took the place of the Han Lin of imperial times as a\r\nnational center for scholarship. A National Economic Council and a\r\nNational Reconstruction Commission performed specialized functions\r\neffectively, with assistance from experts provided by the League of\r\nNations. In fact, there was a scattering of foreign advisers throughout\r\nthe government. Of these the highest in rank were placed at the disposal\r\nof the Council of State, some rendering actual technical service, others\r\nactive in unofficial representation abroad, propaganda, lobbying in\r\nforeign capitals, or similar tasks. Other advisers were attached to the\r\n_yüans_ and to the ministries.\r\n\r\nProvincial government under the Nanking regime was subordinated to the\r\nExecutive _Yüan_ through the Ministry of the Interior. The provinces\r\neach possessed a commission form of government, with the commission\r\nchairman serving as titular head of the province. The actual operation\r\nof the provincial governments exhibited a great deal of variation,\r\ndepending on the character of the area, the extent of its political\r\ndevelopment, and the tangible influence enjoyed by the National\r\nGovernment. The provincial commission combined the policy-making,\r\npolicy-executing, and quasi-judicial functions, operating largely on the\r\nbasis of instructions from Nanking and transmitting reports through the\r\nSecretariat of the Executive _Yüan_ at the other end. Attached to each\r\ncommission were a secretariat and four or more departments--mainly civil\r\naffairs, finance, reconstruction, and education. The department heads\r\nwere members of the commission--a type of government not unlike that of\r\nAmerican cities under the Galveston plan. The theory of Sun Yat-sen\r\nprovided, however, that the province should decrease in importance with\r\nthe growth of modern government in China, so that the dangerous\r\nregionalism in the country would eventually be denied overt political\r\nexpression. He saw the future significance of the provincial governments\r\nonly in their role as intermediaries for _hsien_-national relationships.\r\nUnder the National Government while at Nanking, the tendency was to\r\ncentralize control and to emphasize national guidance in those provinces\r\nsquarely under Nationalist rule. In other provinces the provincial\r\ngovernments tended to follow local conditions and mirror the national\r\nstandards as a matter of decorum only. The provincial governments were\r\nfar less important in the life of the provinces than was the National\r\nGovernment for the nation. They had the national civilian and military\r\nauthorities to cope with, in addition to the impositions of their own\r\nlocal military. Their sources of revenue were not ample, and their\r\nauthority not well established. In some provinces the commission form\r\nwas adopted only as a matter of legal compliance, leaving to local\r\nleaders the actual conduct of affairs. In fact, reform centered on the\r\n_hsien_ rather than the province, partly because the province was a\r\npotential rival to the nation, and partly because the _hsien_ was a more\r\norganic unit in Chinese society.\r\n\r\nBetween the provincial authorities and those of the _hsien_ there stood\r\nSpecial Commissioners of Administrative Inspection, whose function was\r\nto relate the two administrative units and to work for the modernization\r\nof _hsien_ organization. The _hsien_ served, and still serves, not only\r\na rural area but also the central municipality in which the _hsien_\r\nmagistrate has his headquarters. The _yamên_ (official building)\r\noccupies the center of the town, mostly a one-story edifice built around\r\na courtyard; some _yamêns_ still display the two flagpoles and the two\r\nstone lions that were required by the custom of the Empire. Usually the\r\n_yamên_ contains:\r\n\r\n\"(_a_) the rooms occupied by the tax collectors and the administrative\r\nand judicial police; (_b_) the court and the assembly room; (_c_) the\r\noffices of the various bureaus; (_d_) the residence for magistrates and\r\nthe dormitory for officers.\"[6] The conduct of _hsien_ government is\r\ninfluenced by three main groups--the illiterate masses, the conservative\r\ngentry, and the younger progressives. In those _hsien_ units where no\r\nreformist or revolutionary pressure is felt, the magistrate and the tax\r\ncollector do little more than collect funds, and the administration is\r\nmarked by the laxity which characterized old Chinese government in its\r\ninadequate form. The gentry, the scholar-administrators, and the tax\r\ncollectors represent a single social group and manage to rule in their\r\nown economic interest. In other _hsien_ units the influence of modern\r\ngovernment is noticeable; the magistrate is in most cases a man\r\ndetermined to put into effect the standards of twentieth-century\r\nadministration. The prestige and power of young men with modern\r\neducations have so increased that they are able to obtain a considerable\r\nnumber of magistracies, and if they are willing they may introduce a\r\nrespectable measure of good government and reform.\r\n\r\nThe magistrate selects his secretary and four bureau heads, subject to\r\nthe approval of the provincial authorities. The secretary performs the\r\nwork usually expected of permanent officials, carrying on much of the\r\nroutine so as to leave the magistrate free for political and\r\nquasi-judicial functions. The secretary is virtually a vice-magistrate\r\nand, if successful, keeps the governmental machinery of the _hsien_ in\r\nsmooth operation. When the magistrate is absent, he acts as the\r\nsubstitute. The four bureaus of the _hsien_ correspond to the four chief\r\nadministrative divisions of the province--civil affairs, finance,\r\nreconstruction, and education. An opium suppression bureau is often\r\nadded, carrying on the anti-narcotic campaign. The civil affairs bureau\r\nhas charge of the census, and supervises local areas within the\r\ndistrict. Such matters as police, militia, sanitary administration,\r\npublic buildings, classical shrines, and parks are frequently under its\r\njurisdiction. The subordinate units of administration are provisional,\r\nbut the _pao-chia_ system has been restored at the lowest level. This is\r\na device for the mutual guarantee, protection, and responsibility of\r\ncitizens, in which ten families make a _pao_ and ten _pao_ make a\r\n_chia_. The tax bureau is one of the weakest links in Chinese local\r\ngovernment, as in this office corruption is rife, and severe oppression\r\nof the farmers most frequent. In unreformed _hsien_ units, the tax\r\nbureau is likely to be the political plum of members of the local\r\ngentry, who use it to extend their tenant farms, promote usury, and\r\ndefraud the government. The provincial governments have begun to send\r\nout accountants and to install regular bookkeeping systems--an\r\nundertaking which if completed would be one of the major reforms of\r\nlocal administration.\r\n\r\nIn the smaller _hsien_ units the magistrate is assisted for judicial\r\npurposes by a judge; in the larger, separate courts are provided. Up to\r\nthe outbreak of hostilities in 1937 the national and provincial\r\ngovernments were making great strides in reorganizing judicial\r\nadministration and in the professionalization of police work. The judges\r\nare appointees of the provincial courts, a factor which may make for\r\ngreater professional capacity and independence. The general importance\r\nof the _hsien_ is illustrated by the fact that in Manchoukuo the\r\nJapanese have been forced to revive this system. They have, however,\r\nimplemented it with a Japanese officer known as the _Kanjikan_, who is\r\nsupposed to advise his Chinese colleague. The experiment is of great\r\ninterest, as it provides the acid test for the Japanese attempt actually\r\nto administer a Chinese area. Without firm _hsien_ governments beneath\r\nthem, the Japanese puppet regimes are foredoomed to failure.[7]\r\n\r\nUntil the beginning of the undeclared war, the departmentalization and\r\nmodernization of the _hsien_ had proceeded most extensively in certain\r\nmodel districts selected for the purpose of political and administrative\r\nexperimentation. Some of these had reached a level of efficiency which\r\naugured well for the future of Chinese government. With the coming of\r\nwar, however, administrative interests had to yield in many cases to\r\npolitical or military ones, but in one significant respect _hsien_\r\ngovernment was constructively affected. The evocation of popular\r\ninterest in and cooperation with the government caused a great\r\nacceleration of progress toward local democracy, and focused attention\r\non reaction and corruption in the inland regions. War propaganda among\r\nthe masses of the people amounted to a call for public-spirited action;\r\nsuch action is bound to take the form of direct military enlistment or\r\nof collaboration in local patriotic and defense schemes.\r\n\r\nMunicipal government in old China was carried on largely by the\r\nofficials of the imperial or provincial bureaucracy. Cities and towns\r\nwere graded and even named according to the rank of the office for which\r\nthey served as headquarters. The imperial administration thus extended\r\nto municipal affairs; each municipal government included a designated\r\nrural area surrounding the city. With the growth of modern government in\r\nChina, plans were considered for a definite and systematic development\r\nof municipal administration. The foreign-controlled cities of the coast\r\nprovided models of Western administration, and the Chinese were not slow\r\nto copy. A few years ago the cities of China were divided for\r\nadministrative purposes into three categories: those administered\r\ndirectly by the national government; those placed directly under the\r\nprovincial governments; and those for which no special category was\r\nprovided, leaving them under the established bureaucratic hierarchy. In\r\n1936 there were five cities of the first class (Nanking, Peiping,\r\nShanghai, Tientsin, and Tsingtao) and eighteen of the second class,\r\nincluding the very important cities of Hankow and Canton. The municipal\r\nadministration is headed by the mayor and the council. The mayor is\r\nappointed by the authority under whose jurisdiction the city is placed.\r\nThe council is composed of two appointed councillors and the chiefs of\r\nthe municipal bureaus--four or more. The four required bureaus are civil\r\naffairs, finance, public works, and education. Intracity organization\r\nwas accomplished through the use of _ch'u_, or wards, subdivided into\r\nfamily groups of defined size. With the development of democracy it was\r\nintended for each of these to take part in the promotion of\r\nself-government; at each level representatives should be chosen by free\r\nsuffrage. The family foundation has remained a significant feature even\r\nof municipal administration.\r\n\r\nThe chief political question before the National Government at the\r\noutbreak of hostilities in the summer of 1937 was the adoption of a\r\npermanent democratic constitution. This was to be accomplished in much\r\nthe same way that the Provisional Constitution had been adopted in\r\n1931--by means of a specially elected People's Congress. In the\r\nmeantime, a draft constitution had reached a nearly final form. The\r\noutstanding features of the draft included the strengthening of the\r\npresidency, the abolition of the Kuomintang party dictatorship, the\r\nextension of a widely defined suffrage to operate on an unprecedented\r\nscale, and provision for periodically assembling People's Congresses to\r\ntake, by and large, the position of the Kuomintang by exercising the\r\nfour powers of the people: initiative, referendum, election, and recall.\r\nThe elective offices would be reduced to a few. The installation and\r\nremoval of the major government officers was a function to be divided\r\nbetween the People's Congress and the president, who was himself to be\r\nelected and recalled by the Congress.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese invasion led to the scattering and the partial suspension\r\nof government. Military needs began to rule the hour. The Kuomintang\r\nParty Congress held in the spring of 1938 elevated Chiang K'ai-shek to\r\nthe newly-created position of _Tsung-tsai_--a term meaning Party Leader,\r\nwhich had been the office held by Sun Yat-sen under the more august\r\nsynonym _Tsung-li_. Not only was this a partial recognition of the\r\nleadership principle[8] in a democracy at war and a testimonial to\r\nChiang as the supreme military leader of the Republic, but it was also a\r\nsubstantial grant of power. Four new powers were given Chiang as Party\r\nLeader: (1) the position of Chairman of the National Kuomintang\r\nCongress; (2) the chairmanship of the Central Executive Committee of the\r\nKuomintang; (3) the power to ask (impliedly, to demand) that the\r\nNational Kuomintang Congress reconsider its resolutions, which amounted\r\nto the grant of a courteous but effective conditional veto; and (4)\r\nfinal authority on Central Executive Committee resolutions, by means of\r\na parallel veto.[9] This apparent trend toward emergency one-man control\r\nwas, however, offset by the convening on July 6, 1938, of the People's\r\nPolitical Council, an advisory all-Party representative body, designed\r\nto substitute temporarily for the again-postponed National Congress. Its\r\nappearance was the widest break in the formal front of one-party\r\nKuomintang rule to occur in a decade, and was heralded as a signal for\r\nthe practical democratization of the government.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Chinese Soviet Republic_\r\n\r\nAfter the suppression of the Marxists by Chiang K'ai-shek and the\r\nliquidation of the Nationalist government at Wu-han, the Chinese\r\nCommunist movement took to underground agitation. It demonstrated its\r\npower, however, by proclaiming the Canton Commune on December 11, 1927.\r\nThe Commune ended in bloody suppression. At the same time, in the far\r\ninterior, the first Chinese Soviet had been established; from it, in\r\nTsalin on the Hunan-Kiangsi border, was to develop the Chinese Soviet\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth anniversary of the Canton Commune the Chinese Soviet\r\nRepublic came into official being. A constitution was adopted, and soon\r\nin the Communist districts soviets began to spread during a period of\r\nrelative peace. Nevertheless, the Soviet organization was always under\r\nconsiderable pressure because of the war waged upon it by Chiang.\r\nAlthough labor and agrarian legislation was adopted, the regime\r\nhad to operate under conditions of extreme military activity,\r\ncounterrevolution, and terror. Despite all these handicaps, the\r\nCommunists kept their government intact; they were able to move it\r\nthousands of miles across China in the historic Long March from South\r\nCentral to Northwest China, which began October 16, 1934, and ended\r\nOctober 20, 1935.\r\n\r\nUnder its constitution, the Chinese Soviet Republic is declared to be\r\n\"the democratic dictatorship of the workers and peasants.\"[10] The\r\nsuffrage was set at the age of sixteen. The government was formed in a\r\nmanner similar to that employed in the U. S. S. R. before the adoption\r\nof the new Soviet Constitution: local soviets elect district or city\r\nsoviets, which in turn elect provincial soviets, which elect a National\r\nCongress of Soviets. In practice, the pattern could not be followed\r\nclosely, since elections were difficult to hold and territorial division\r\nnot always certain. The Central Executive Committee of the Congress of\r\nSoviets was the chief political authority of the Communist regime; it\r\nhad the familiar executive organization of the Soviet system: a\r\nPresidium of the Central Executive Committee and under it the People's\r\nCouncil, the equivalent of a cabinet. The strength of the Chinese\r\nCommunists lay in their Party and adjunct organizations, in their land\r\npolicy, and in their Red Army.\r\n\r\nThe central government of the Chinese Soviet Republic was no mere torso.\r\nIt included the following agencies immediately subordinate to the\r\nPeople's Council: the Supreme Court, the Ministry of Inspection, the\r\nMinistry of Finance, the Ministry of Land, the Ministry of Labor, the\r\nRevolutionary Military Commissariat, the Ministry of Home Affairs, the\r\nPolitical Safety Bureau, the Ministry of Communications, the People's\r\nEconomic Commissariat, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Food, the\r\nMinistry of Education, and--strangely--the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the kidnaping at Sian at the end of 1936, the\r\nNationalists and the Communists drifted toward a _rapprochement_. The\r\nnext February the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang accepted\r\nthe Communist offer of United Front collaboration, although disguising\r\nthe acceptance by formal conditions for a Communist surrender. In\r\nSeptember the Chinese Soviet Republic was ready to assume the name of\r\n_Special Administrative District of the Chinese Republic_. This left\r\ntheir governmental and administrative organization unaffected; nor did\r\nit mean the dissolution of the Red Army, now also under a new name, that\r\nof the Eighth Route Army. With the commencement of the Japanese advance,\r\nCommunist leaders began taking part in the work of the National\r\nGovernment, first at Nanking and then inland.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Other Governments in China_\r\n\r\nAs the National Government at Nanking rose to a dominant position in\r\nChinese affairs, regional regimes outside its fold found it less easy to\r\nfit themselves into the framework of the new Chinese state. The\r\nDisbandment War of 1930-1931 had witnessed the defeat of the two most\r\nredoubtable _tuchüns_ remaining in the North. On the other hand, it\r\nbecame increasingly evident that acceptance of the Nanking hegemony in\r\nname led to the infiltration of Nanking rule in fact.\r\n\r\nNothing but a register of encyclopedic proportions could list and\r\ndescribe the various political institutions which arose calling\r\nthemselves _governments_ in the troubled quarter-century of the Chinese\r\nRepublican era. Some have bordered on the pathological: Islamistan, for\r\ninstance, which was the work of an Englishman who proclaimed himself\r\nemperor of a new Moslem Empire in Central Asia. The provincial\r\nauthorities of Chinese Turkestan (Sinkiang) drove him out by using\r\nairplanes borrowed from the Soviet Union. In Foochow, in 1932-1933,\r\nthere arose a movement headed by exiled Left Kuomintang leaders and\r\nother ultra-patriots eager for immediate war with Japan. This government\r\nwas the first in years which did not pay lip service to the _San Min Chu\r\nI_, nor claimed legitimate descent from the movement of Sun Yat-sen and\r\nhis revolutionaries--a surprising circumstance. Its very flexible\r\nconstitution would have permitted collaboration with the Chinese\r\nSoviets--had the Red leaders not decided against it. The other main\r\npoint in which it varied from the pattern set by the Nanking government\r\nwas its profession of federalism. Known as the Federal Revolutionary\r\nGovernment of China, it lasted a few months only to be destroyed by\r\nChiang, who had no scruples against using the weight of his modern\r\narmies, including planes and motorized troops. These vegetations of\r\ngovernment can only interest the political botanist. Far more\r\ntroublesome have been the opposition governments mentored or sponsored\r\nby outside forces. Tibet and Sinkiang (Chinese Turkestan) provided a\r\nfertile field of anti-Nanking agitation. Two \"states\" in China proper--\r\nManchoukuo and an equally Japanese-controlled Peking Republic\r\n(1937)--find their counterparts in three others located in Chinese\r\ndependencies: the Communist republics of Outer Mongolia and Tannu-Tuva,\r\nand the ambiguous \"state\" in Eastern Inner Mongolia (sometimes called\r\n_Mêngkokuo_).\r\n\r\nThese Communist republics are under stable government, and, judged from\r\nreports which reach the outside, seem efficiently administered. They lie\r\nin the former Imperial Russian sphere of influence, south of the\r\nSino-Russian border; except for the complications which would have\r\narisen internationally, they might just as well have been in the Soviet\r\nUnion as outside. Both governments maintain legations in Moscow. It\r\nmight be mentioned that when the Russian Red Army invaded Manchuria in\r\n1929 during the conflict over the Chinese Eastern Railway, a Barga\r\nMongol Soviet was temporarily established. The Communist \"states\" cannot\r\nbe compared with the Chinese Soviet Republic, which depended on no\r\noutside military support and resulted from a great ideological drive.\r\nThey serve as advance posts of the Soviet Union--precedent for the\r\ncreation of puppet states within China. Years later the Japanese\r\nmanufactured a \"state\" in Eastern Inner Mongolia, with the cooperation\r\nof anti-Chinese Mongol princes, which Japan has publicized very little.\r\nKnown in the world press as _Mêngkokuo_, it provides a Japanese buffer\r\nstate to meet the Russian buffer of Outer Mongolia. On October 29, 1937,\r\nit reached its latest phase with the proclamation of the Autonomous\r\nGovernment of Inner Mongolia.\r\n\r\nThe Great Empire of Manchou, to use its present official name, arose as\r\nManchoukuo. The word itself was a concession to world opinion, as\r\nManchuria is known to the Chinese simply as the Three Eastern Provinces\r\n(Tung San Shêng); its population is overwhelmingly Chinese. With the\r\ndevelopment of Chinese national unity, the Japanese position in this\r\narea was threatened. They invaded Manchuria in September, 1931; the\r\nfollowing year they proclaimed the independence of Manchoukuo, inviting\r\nthe young man who as a child had been the last Manchu emperor of China\r\nto serve as the head of the state. In 1934 he was installed as Emperor\r\nKang Têh of the Great Empire of Manchou. The Japanese have done a great\r\ndeal toward bettering their own economic position in Manchuria, but the\r\neffect of their policies on the Chinese population is of doubtful merit.\r\nEqual motives underlay the rebirth of Peking, where on December 14,\r\n1937, the Provisional Government of the Republic of China was\r\nproclaimed.[11] The old Peking-Republican flag was flown. The heads of\r\nthe new regime were aged men who already twenty years ago had cooperated\r\nwith the Japanese. Others served under duress and performed their mock\r\nroutine in the cold agony of treason. The new administration is\r\nhoneycombed with Japanese \"advisers\" and under the domination of the\r\nJapanese army.\r\n\r\nTo round out their collection of puppet governments, the Japanese\r\nestablished in the spring of 1938 a Reformed Government of the Republic\r\nof China in Nanking, and even went so far as to adopt--provisionally, at\r\nleast--the constitutional form of the National Government, which had\r\nmoved upriver. This regime was admittedly even more ephemeral than the\r\nothers, and the Japanese announced their intention of consolidating it\r\nwith the set-up they had organized in Peiping. For the time, it was to\r\nbe subordinate for purposes of theory to the Northern regime, but the\r\nfuture of the whole Japanese adventure was in doubt, and that of their\r\nhalf-conceived instrumentalities even more dubious.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Growth of Government in China_\r\n\r\nIn the decade following 1927, Chinese government became more significant\r\nthan it had been since the days of the founding emperors of the Ch'in\r\nand the Han. Power was based on a correlation of government with\r\nideological and military forces. The Nationalist Party was the first to\r\neffectuate this correlation, in part as a result of lessons learned from\r\nthe Soviet advisers in the period of collaboration.[12] The Nationalists\r\nutilized the doctrinal bases of the _San Min Chu I_, tested in the\r\nsocial revolution which arose from the Nationalist-Communist propaganda.\r\nThe great personal prestige of Sun Yat-sen was one of the most important\r\ncontributing factors to the growth of Nationalist administration in\r\nCanton.\r\n\r\nThe military ability and political leadership of Chiang K'ai-shek\r\nlargely determined the success of the subsequent National Government.\r\nChiang created a military machine superior to any other in China and\r\ncoordinated army and government in such a way as to add strength to\r\nboth.[13] But Chiang stood not alone. His wife became his _alter ego_\r\nfor press relations, and important in her own right. His brother-in-law\r\nT. V. Soong, resourceful financier, and his sisters-in-law, Mme Sun\r\nYat-sen (Sun's second wife) and Mme H. H. K'ung (wife of a later\r\nminister of finance), were strong influences at Nanking. Yet these\r\nmembers of the \"Soong dynasty\" did not shape the course of Nanking\r\npolicies as a closed concern. They were part of a larger group sharing\r\nresponsibility equally.\r\n\r\nOnce the National Government was established its success was largely the\r\nresult of success. Improvements in the international status of China\r\naccrued to the prestige of the regime, and a new surge toward\r\nreconstruction, delayed intolerably long by the anarchy of _tuchüns_,\r\noccurred as the result of the Nanking hegemony. In the later years of\r\nthe National Government, before the Japanese onslaught transformed it\r\ninto a quasi-military regime fighting for its existence, the increased\r\nextent of the national police power was brought into sharp relief. With\r\nthe extension of a unified gendarmery service over great parts of the\r\nnation, and the development of a court system which worked well except\r\nwhen under political pressure, the individual came to face government as\r\na reality--more than ever before, under any dynasty. The government\r\ndefied custom and tradition in promoting public health, in attacking\r\nepidemics, in sponsoring modern burial practices, and in deriding\r\nunhygienic superstitions. In the broad field of mores which adjoins\r\npublic health, the influence of the government made itself felt--in\r\nreducing the cost of marriage, in promoting municipal cleanliness and\r\ntidiness in public places, in furthering temperance. The New Life\r\nmovement combined the prestige of the government with the elasticity of\r\nvoluntary association. In its closing days Nanking whipped up an\r\nunprecedented wave of public spirit among the masses.\r\n\r\nAs to government control of the economy, the Nanking government aimed at\r\nsystem, in place of the inchoate conditions which existed before its\r\nascendancy. Chinese banks began to be as reliable as those of the West.\r\nThe currency was standardized on a national basis. A national fiscal\r\npolicy was adopted. A great achievement was the introduction of a\r\nmanaged paper currency in a country where specie alone had been\r\nrespected for ages. Agriculture, however, was lagging behind.\r\n\r\nGovernment disavowed its previous identification with a scholastic\r\nofficialdom. It dispensed with a state religion, although the\r\ncommemoration of Sun Yat-sen compensated in part for the change.\r\nGovernment disclaimed any vague totalitarianism and instead clarified\r\nits zone of functioning through the use of law. By narrowing the field\r\nof its authority, it increased its effectiveness. Nationalization,\r\ncentralization, bureaucratization, the development of lawful process,\r\nthe emergence of a half-Western state working for Chinese needs--thus\r\nmay the growth of government be characterized in the period after 1928.\r\nObstacles remained, enough to dismay any ruler; but they had become\r\nobstacles and were not impassable barriers of cynicism, incomprehension,\r\nand futility.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese invasion of 1937 had two immediate effects on the\r\ngovernment. It shattered overnight the structure erected by the Nanking\r\nregime. The work of a decade was undone. On the other hand, the Japanese\r\nthreat helped to drive the Communists and Nationalists together and\r\nforced into the national nexus those regional leaders who were\r\nmaintaining the last vestiges of separatism. Most consequential of all:\r\nJapan's push--the greatest invasion the Chinese had known since the\r\n1600's--thrust government and people toward each other. Foreign troops\r\ntaught inland China what nationalism really meant.\r\n\r\nThey taught nationalism not merely with the fury of their guns, or with\r\nthe cruelties of their hysterical troops in Nanking. The Japanese\r\nfostered nationalism most strikingly when they drove inland the\r\nprotagonists of nationalism. Students, merchants, engineers, soldiers,\r\nadministrators, physicians, and scientists of the coast were forced into\r\nthe far interior. Villagers to whom the sight of these modern Chinese\r\nwas as rare as the sight of a lama in Arkansas now had such refugees\r\ndwelling among them. The effect of forced cultural cross-fertilization\r\nis yet to be seen, but it may prove to be of extraordinary significance.\r\nChinese able to hold their own with any representative of the Western\r\nworld can now be found in the remote valleys and plateaus of the\r\nhinterland--twentieth-century China and timeless China, united in their\r\nhatred of the invaders, and deeply aware of their new national unity,\r\ntheir desperate need for power.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] See above, pp. 41 ff.\r\n\r\n[2] See Wu Chih-fang, _Chinese Government and Politics_, pp. 147 ff.,\r\nShanghai, 1934.\r\n\r\n[3] The outline given and the description offered are brief and\r\ngeneralized because the Japanese invasion will probably lead to\r\nrecurrent reorganization of the government.

The oldest society on earth found itself forced to\r\nredefine its position and to reconstruct its ways of thought and\r\ninternal means of organization. Pressure from without compelled China to\r\nadopt the modern state. Chinese society was required to incorporate this\r\nstate and all implied institutions in its routine living. The earlier\r\nperiod of the Republic marks an epoch in which modern forms had been\r\nestablished in harmony with the accepted standards of the Western state\r\nsystem. Chinese society fell into chaos beneath the up-to-date\r\nsuperstructure. The later period witnessed the correlation of state and\r\nsociety by coordination of ideological, military, and governmental\r\npower. From the collapse of the Manchu rule in 1911 to the operative\r\nzest of the National Government at Nanking in 1937 there was a\r\nrevolution in the processes of government which for completeness can\r\ncompare with any century of Western transformation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Collapse of the Imperial Society_\r\n\r\nWestern ideology has failed to enter China as a constructive whole, but\r\nit has smashed whatever reality there was to the old world view.\r\nWestern-educated Chinese leadership has undertaken the task of governing\r\na people which has learned only indirectly of the West. In carrying out\r\na program of adaptation, contemporary Chinese leadership has relied on\r\nSun Yat-sen's phrase, \"modernization without Westernization.\" But a\r\ndilemma remains. How can the standards of the modern world be divorced\r\nfrom their Western origins? How can Western technology be used without\r\nthe attitude of mind which has created it and brought it to operative\r\nefficiency? How can a world which never knew Rome or the Normanic _Curia\r\nRegis_ know jurisprudence? How can modern government be made Chinese,\r\nwhen government itself has meant something far different in China from\r\nwhat it has meant in the West?\r\n\r\nFurther, the nature of Chinese leadership has not only been transformed\r\nfrom being literary and ethical in its orientation to being technical\r\nand legal; it has also been transformed socially in the replacement of\r\nscholars by soldiers. The ideal ruler of old was a humane classicist\r\nwith a taste for historical studies; the contemporary Chinese ruler must\r\nbe military, if not militaristic, and must have the inevitable\r\nbackground of engineering and management which modern war connotes. The\r\nsoldier must collaborate with the modern administrator, while both\r\nrecapture the high ideals of devotion typical of the old scholastic\r\nrule, even if they cannot use its substance. These imperatives are\r\nindispensable if China is to live.\r\n\r\nFinally, the language system which did so much to create and then\r\nperpetuate the scholastic elite through thousands of years of Chinese\r\nculture has now submitted to changes deeper and more far-reaching than\r\nany in the past. The development of the _pai-hua_ school of literature\r\nand the progress of mass education indicate that even with ideographs\r\nthe Chinese can reach conditions of uniform literacy approximating those\r\nwhich prevail in the advanced Western nations. If the alphabetization of\r\nthe Chinese language, which is now in the form of tentative experiment,\r\nshould become a fact, even more striking developments could take place.\r\nReading and writing, and on this basis the transmission of authoritative\r\ntenets, does not presuppose profound economic adjustments. The modern\r\nChinese will know his classics increasingly through paraphrases no more\r\ndifficult than a newspaper column. When it is realized that the\r\nsimplification of intellectual activity is offered to a people schooled\r\nin the idolatry of books, the potentialities of educational and\r\nintellectual renaissance--already partially realized--become apparent.\r\n\r\nWith the disappearance of the imperial world society of the Confucians\r\nas a consequence of its encirclement by Westernized states, with the\r\npassing of the scholars and the rise of Western-trained soldiers,\r\nlawyers, and technicians, and with the alteration of the linguistic and\r\nintellectual foundation upon which the old society rested, what is there\r\nleft of old China?\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Nature of the Transformation_\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the ideological change is not complete. No Western\r\nidea can enter China unimpaired. Sun Yat-sen was influenced by the\r\nalmost entirely contradictory notions of Western nationalism, democracy,\r\nand socialism. In the _San Min Chu I_ their Western identity was\r\ndestroyed, and the new doctrines had much in common with the past.\r\nWestern ideas served largely as a mold; when the mold was removed, the\r\nform was Western but the content was still Chinese. Mazzini and\r\nConfucius might both approve of Sun's political doctrines.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the extrapolitical agencies of Chinese life remain. Chinese\r\nsociety may be shattered in dogma, but it persists in fact. The family,\r\nthough subject to legal redefinition caused by Western cultural and\r\neconomic influences, nevertheless plays a role far greater than in the\r\nWest. The village is still the fundamental grouping among the rural\r\nmasses. The guild system is impaired by the Western impact, but the\r\nparty organizations--Nationalist and Communist--have absorbed much of\r\nthe strength which once lay in the _hui_. Under foreign domination,\r\nthese institutions may play a determining role in the struggle against\r\nthe intruder.\r\n\r\nThirdly, for modern government the Chinese have resources of their own\r\nexperience on which to rely. But they also have Western devices and\r\nprescriptions. The National Government, while falling short of Western\r\nlevels of government efficiency, nevertheless trained large numbers of\r\nChinese to think in terms of the modern state. But no new pattern has as\r\nyet crystallized. Chinese political and military development may well\r\npresent a flexibility beyond Western grasp.\r\n\r\nFourth, the Chinese have still ahead of them the choice of criteria of\r\nauthority to prevail in society. Learning, office, property played a\r\ndecisive part in the old society. Hitherto, the Republic has grown with\r\nthree modes of power: ideological, military, governmental. The relation\r\nbetween them is not yet determined.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Problems of Government in China_\r\n\r\nAmong the governmental problems confronting China the acquisition of\r\nnational territorial sovereignty stands out. Ever since the\r\nestablishment of the Republic the Chinese have grown acutely conscious\r\nof the fact that some of their most important economic centers have been\r\nlifted out of the national territory. Sun Yat-sen realized in the\r\nfrustration of his first efforts toward republicanization and social\r\npolicy that the problems of internal government could not be settled\r\nunless the people as a whole were free. Without general freedom there\r\ncould be no question of democracy, no question of a coordinated plan for\r\nthe realization of the _min shêng_ principle.[1] Observing the intimate\r\nrelation between the _tuchüns_ and the foreign interests, which often\r\nfavored them, Sun and his followers began to stress their nationalist\r\nrole. With the Japanese invasion of the Northeast in 1931, of Shanghai\r\nin 1932, of Inner Mongolia and North China in the following years, and\r\nof China as a whole in 1937, the issue of territorial sovereignty has\r\nbecome the most important one of all. Until it is settled, all other\r\nquestions must necessarily be considered in their relation to it.\r\n\r\nSecond, the question of economic sustenance and development is becoming\r\npressing. Without an adequate economic base, the Chinese population\r\nlives under the constant threat of simply starving to death. Military\r\ndifficulties emphasize this problem; in fact, military effectiveness and\r\nstrategy will have to depend upon the physical existence of the people\r\nin and behind the lines. The Chinese masses have lived close to the edge\r\nof starvation for a long time. As a consequence, the Chinese cannot wage\r\nwar but in close proximity to the point of economic paralysis--plain\r\nexhaustion of the physical necessities of life. The economic problem\r\ncannot wait for spontaneous self-cure.\r\n\r\nThird, the Chinese will have to recognize the need for politicalization\r\nof public opinion. They must evolve the faculty of transforming group\r\nopinion into governmental or organizational action. They must acquire\r\ntechniques for group collaboration which will allow them to break down\r\ntraditional groups into more diversified units--a government commission,\r\na factory workshop, an army unit--without reference to family bonds or\r\nvillage and _hui_ connections. This is less a problem of doctrine or\r\neducation than one of habit and practice.\r\n\r\nFourth, the restoration of national prestige is necessary to the\r\nsecurity of the Chinese nation in the international sphere, and to the\r\nwholesome development of the Chinese people within their national\r\nboundaries as well. They cannot effectively borrow from the West if they\r\ndo so reluctantly, overcome by the thought of inferiority or by shame.\r\nUnless they conquer their present handicap, the Chinese will continue to\r\nlack self-confidence.\r\n\r\nFifth, the army problem must be solved. In the last analysis, the excess\r\nof men under arms damages the Chinese military, as the number of\r\nwell-equipped effectives remains disproportionately small. The hordes of\r\nhalf-armed soldiers constitute a heavy burden upon the society, reduce\r\nthe general economic level, and--by affording one particular group a\r\ndisproportionate opportunity for making its preferences felt--brutalize\r\nthe operation of public opinion and discourage peaceable group pursuit.\r\n\r\nSixth, the Chinese state--if China is to solve political questions\r\nthrough governmental procedures--must be constituted as a clear and\r\nlegal entity. The old imperial society of China was able to dispense\r\nwith law through reliance upon social forces expressing themselves in a\r\nlarge number of small but stable units. If these disappear the question\r\narises: How can the individual conceive clearly his relationships within\r\nChinese society? Systematized modern organization requires a legal\r\nframework.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Question of Chinese Political Survival_\r\n\r\nThat the Chinese will survive, biologically, as a race--this no one\r\ndoubts. That the Chinese will survive culturally is more open to\r\nquestion. The Chinese absorbed all their conquerors of the past because\r\nthe country was large, because the people were extraordinarily\r\nhomogeneous in ideology and habit, because the Chinese were wealthier\r\nthan their conquerors and more cultured. Absorption or cultural\r\nextinction is not a matter of race; it is a question of ideology, of\r\nthought and the habits which arise from ways of thought. What ways of\r\nthought are there today that will absorb the conquerors? What ways of\r\nthought are there that the conquerors might tear apart from the long\r\npast, to change China into a mere geographical expression?\r\n\r\nIn the past, China has been conquered by invaders who accepted the\r\nChinese estimate of China, and who reciprocated the Chinese self-esteem\r\nwith a deep admiration for Chinese culture. China's modern invaders\r\nbring with them a veritable cult of national self-aggrandizement. Their\r\nfondness for the Chinese past is mixed with contempt for modern China.\r\nWill the Chinese preserve their national equanimity and sanity in the\r\nface of such an attitude? Much depends upon their military and political\r\nfortune and its effect upon their confidence.\r\n\r\nGovernment in the Republican era demonstrates the fertility and\r\ninventiveness of the Chinese mind in building political and\r\nadministrative institutions and in finding means of uniting and\r\ncontrolling the Chinese as a people. When the chaos from which they have\r\nbeen emerging is considered, their recent accomplishments are an\r\nattestation of political ability. The National Government and the\r\nChinese Soviet Republic were worthy adversaries; each met disastrous\r\nodds, not the least of which was the other. Their governmental forms may\r\nbe destroyed and yet reappear so long as the Chinese remain Chinese in\r\nthe sense of their long past. Sun Yat-sen expressed his countrymen's\r\nelementary social and national consciousness, so different from the\r\nfeverish nationalism of the West, in very clear language:\r\n\r\n  Suppose that we, Chinese, were naturalized English or Americans and\r\n  helped England or America to conquer China on the principle that we\r\n  accept cosmopolitanism, would our consciences, I ask you, be at rest\r\n  or not? If our consciences troubled us, that would be a sign that we\r\n  have nationalism; nationalism would trouble our consciences.[2]\r\n\r\nSuch nationalism may prove indestructible. With democracy and _min\r\nshêng_ as nationalism's corollaries, China promises to contribute a gift\r\nof peace and political intelligence to the world, and may yet return to\r\nher ancient role as the pacific preceptress of nations.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] See above, pp. 41 ff.\r\n\r\n[2] Paschal M. d'Elia, S.
