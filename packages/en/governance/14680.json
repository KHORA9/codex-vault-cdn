I.--MAY, 1862.--No. V.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWHAT SHALL WE DO WITH IT?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first blood that was shed in our Revolutionary struggle, was in\r\nBoston, in March, 1770. The next at Lexington, in June, 1775.\r\n\r\nThe interval was filled with acts of coercion and oppression on the one\r\nside and with complaints and remonstrances on the other. But the thought\r\nof Independence was entertained by very few of our people, even for some\r\ntime after the affair at Lexington. Loyalty to the mother country was\r\nprofessed even by those most clamorous in their complaints, and\r\nsincerely so, too. The great majority thought that redress of grievances\r\ncould be obtained without severance from Great Britain.\r\n\r\nBut events hurried the people on, and that which was scarcely spoken of\r\nat the beginning of the struggle, soon became its chief object.\r\n\r\nIs it not the same with our present contest with the South? We took up\r\narms to defend the Constitution, to sustain our Government, to maintain\r\nthe Union; and in the course of performing that work, it would seem as\r\nif Emancipation was forced upon us, and as if it was yet to be the prime\r\nobject in view.\r\n\r\nLo! how much has already been done toward that end, even though not\r\noriginally intended! As our armies advance into the enemies' country,\r\nthousands of slaves are practically emancipated by the flight and\r\ndesertion of their rebel masters. The rules and articles of war have\r\nbeen so altered by Congress as to forbid our military forces from\r\nreturning to bondage any who flee from it. The President has proposed,\r\nand Congress has entertained, the proposition of aiding the States in\r\nemancipation. Fremont, who has been regarded as the representative of\r\nthe emancipation feeling, has been restored to active command. And\r\nmultitudes of our people, who have hitherto considered themselves as\r\nbound by the Constitution not to interfere with the subject, have become\r\nopen in the avowal that as slavery has been the cause of the evil, so it\r\nmust now be wiped out forever.\r\n\r\nIt would seem, therefore, as if it was inevitable that the question of\r\nemancipation is to be thrust upon us, and we must be prepared to meet\r\nit. It is in this view, and irrespective of the question of right and\r\nwrong in slavery, that some considerations present themselves, which can\r\nnot be ignored.\r\n\r\nThe difference of race between the white and the negro will ever keep\r\nthem apart, and forbid their amalgamation. One or the other must\r\nultimately go to the wall, and it is worth our while to see what time\r\nis doing with the question: 'Which must it be in this country?'\r\n\r\nHence it is important to note the progress of both the races with us.\r\n\r\nIn the course of seventy years, that is, from the census of 1790 to that\r\nof 1860, the slave population has increased from 697,897 to 4,002,996.\r\nSo that our colored population is now six times as great as when our\r\nGovernment was formed.\r\n\r\nDuring the same period the free population has increased from 3,231,975\r\nto 27,280,070, or nearly nine times as great as in 1790. Of this\r\nincrease about 3,000,000 is the result of emigration; so that the\r\nnative-born population has increased to about 24,000,000, or about eight\r\ntimes as many as in the beginning of our Government. If due allowance be\r\nmade for those born of emigrant parents,[A] it would seem that the two\r\nraces have about kept pace with each other in their natural increase.\r\n\r\nA more minute examination, however, will show that the natural increase\r\nof the colored race has been in a greater ratio than that of the whites,\r\nnative-born to the soil.\r\n\r\nThe following tables will show how this is, both as to the colored and\r\nthe white races.\r\n\r\nINCREASE OF SLAVE POPULATION.\r\n\r\nYears.  No. of Slaves.  Increase.  Per ct. of Increase.\r\n\r\n1790,      697,897\r\n1800,      893,041       195,144       28\r\n1810,    1,191,364       298,323       32\r\n1820,    1,538,064       346,700       29\r\n1830,    2,009,031       470,967       29\r\n1840,    2,487,855       478,324       24\r\n1850,    3,204,313       716,958       29\r\n1860,    4,002,996       798,683       25\r\n\r\nThe average increase in every ten years during the seventy years has\r\nbeen about 28 per cent.\r\n\r\nINCREASE OF WHOLE POPULATION, INCLUDING SLAVES\r\nAND EMIGRANTS\r\n\r\nYears.

So that if anything should occur to\r\ncheck the tide of emigration, the blacks in this country would increase\r\nin a faster ratio than the whites.\r\n\r\nWe can form some idea as to the danger of such a check, when we advert\r\nto the fact that the emigration which in 1854 was 427,833, fell off in\r\n1858 to 144,652.\r\n\r\nTo finish the picture which these figures present to us, let us carry\r\nthe mind forward a decade or two. At the average rate of increase of the\r\nblacks, namely, 28 per cent, we shall have, of the slave population\r\nalone, and excluding the free blacks, 5,060,585 in 1870, and 6,577,584\r\nin 1880. And by that time they will be increasing at the rate of 150,000\r\nto 200,000 a year.\r\n\r\nCarl Schurz, in his speech at the Cooper Institute, in New-York, put to\r\nhis audience a pertinent inquiry: 'You ask me, What shall we do with our\r\nnegroes, who are now 4,000,000? And I ask you, What will you do with\r\nthem when they will be 8,000,000--or rather, _what will they do with\r\nyou?_ Surely, surely the question involves the greatest problem of the\r\nage.\r\n\r\nIf our fathers had met the question seventy years ago, we should not now\r\nbehold the spectacle of 6,000,000 of our people in rebellion, and an\r\narmy of 400,000 men arrayed against the integrity of the Union. And we\r\nmay well profit by the example so far as to ask ourselves the question,\r\nWhat will be the condition of our country and of our posterity, fifty\r\nyears hence, if we, too, shirk the question as painful and difficult of\r\nsolution?\r\n\r\nWhether ultimate and universal emancipation will be one of the necessary\r\nmodes of dealing with it, time must show. In the mean time there is a\r\nquestion immediately pressing upon us. Day by day our armies are\r\nadvancing among them, and every news of a contest that comes, brings us\r\naccounts of the swarms of 'contrabands' who are flocking to us for\r\nprotection. At one place alone, Port Royal, S.C., the Government Agent\r\nreports that there are at least fifteen thousand slaves deserted by\r\ntheir masters, and thus practically emancipated. Untaught and unwonted\r\nto take care of themselves--our armies consuming the fruits of the earth\r\nand finding no employment for these 'National Freedmen'--the danger is\r\ngreat that want, and temptation, and the absence of the government to\r\nwhich they have been accustomed, may yet drive them to become lawless\r\nhordes, preying on all.\r\n\r\nThe same state of things must of necessity exist wherever the\r\nslave-owner flies from the approach of our armies; and we have now\r\npresented to us the alternative of either allowing their state to be\r\nworse by reason of their emancipation, or better, according as the wise\r\nand the humane among us may deal with the subject.\r\n\r\nSome measures, we learn, have already been initiated for the emergency.\r\n'The Educational Commission' of Boston, at the head of which is Governor\r\nAndrews; 'The Freedman's Relief Association,' in New-York, with Judge\r\nEdmonds as its President; and a similar society in Philadelphia, of\r\nwhich Stephen Colwell is Chairman, are societies of large-hearted men\r\nand women, banded together, as they express it, to 'teach the freedmen\r\nof the colored race civilization and Christianity; to imbue them with\r\nnotions of order, industry, economy and self-reliance, and to elevate\r\nthem in the scale of humanity, by inspiring them with self-respect.'\r\n\r\nThe task is certainly a high and holy one, and eminently necessary. How\r\nfar it will be sustained by the Government or the people, or how far the\r\npurpose can be carried out with a race who have been intentionally kept\r\nin profound ignorance, is part of the great problem that we are to\r\nsolve. But not all of it, by any means. There is much more for\r\nenlightened patriotism and wise humanity yet to do, before the task\r\nshall be accomplished and the work begun by the Revolution shall be\r\nfinished; and to prevent a conflict of races, which can end only in the\r\nextermination of one or the other.\r\n\r\nThe 16,000,000 of natives who were once masters of this whole continent\r\nare now dwindled into a few insignificant tribes, 'away among the\r\nmountains.' Is such to be the fate of the negro also? Or has the spirit\r\nof God's charity so far progressed among us that, unlike our fathers, we\r\ncan redeem rather than destroy, can emancipate rather than enslave?\r\n\r\nBe the answer to those questions what it may, there are other\r\nconsiderations, immediately affecting ourselves as a nation and a race.\r\n\r\nSlavery would seem to retard our advancement in both respects.\r\n\r\nDuring the ten years from 1850 to 1860, the total population of our\r\ncountry increased about 37 per cent.\r\n\r\nIn 1790, there were seventeen States in the Union, and of those\r\nseventeen, eight are now slave States, and the following table of those\r\nStates will show how the increase of slavery retards the advance of the\r\nwhites:\r\n\r\n                                Ratio of                    Ratio of\r\n                  Free Whites.

Carolina,    274,567  308,186     9    384,984   407,185       7\r\nTennessee,      756,753  859,528    14    239,460   287,112      20\r\nVirginia,       894,800 1097,373    23    472,628   495,826       5\r\n\r\n* Decrease.\r\n\r\nFrom these facts, it would seem that, in the two States in which slavery\r\nhas decreased, the increase of the whites has been 55 and 56 per cent,\r\nexceeding the average ratio of increase in the whole nation. While in\r\nall the other States, where slavery has increased, none of them have\r\ncome up to the average national ratio of increase, and in one of them,\r\n(South-Carolina,) the increase is not one quarter the national average.\r\n\r\nIn respect to South-Carolina, it is a remarkable fact that while she has\r\nnow nearly four tunes as many slaves as she had in 1790, her whole\r\npopulation (slaves and all) is not three times what it then was, and her\r\nfree population is only a little more than twice its number in 1790. In\r\nother words, while in seventy years her slave population has increased\r\nfour-fold, her free population has only a little more than doubled.[B]\r\n\r\nThese facts teach their own lesson; but they compel all who value the\r\nUnion and the peace of the nation, to ask how far they have had to do\r\nwith the troubles of nullification and secession, which for thirty years\r\nhave been plaguing us, and have now culminated in a terrible rebellion!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA PHILOSOPHIC BANKRUPT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great financial storm that swept over our country and Europe, in the\r\n'fall of 1857,' overwhelming so many large and apparently staunch\r\nvessels, did not disdain to capsize and send to the bottom many smaller\r\ncraft; my own among the number. She was not as heavily freighted (to\r\ncontinue for a moment the nautical metaphor) as some that sunk around\r\nher; but as she bore my all, it looked at first pretty much like a\r\nlife-and-death business, especially the latter. For a time, all was\r\nhorror and confusion; but as the wreck cleared away, I soon discovered\r\nthat there would, at any rate, remain to me the consolation that others\r\nwould not lose through my misfortunes; that the calamity, if such it\r\nwere, would affect no one but myself. My own experience, and my\r\nobservation of those around me, has led me, naturally enough, to ponder\r\na good deal on the subject of reverses in life, and as no page of\r\ngenuine experience can be considered wholly valueless, it may do no harm\r\nto record my own. Though many have undergone reverses, few, with the\r\nexception of ministers, ever seem to have written about them, a class of\r\nmen who, whatever their other troubles, in these days of bronchitis and\r\nfastidious parishes, have usually been exempt from trials of this\r\npeculiar character.\r\n\r\nBishop Butler, in one of his sermons on Human Nature, alludes to a sect\r\nin philosophy, representing, I suppose, the 'selfish system,' one of\r\nwhose ideas is that men are naturally pleased on hearing of the\r\nmisfortunes of others. La Rochefoucauld expresses the same sentiment as\r\nhis own. Couched in plain language, this appears to be a gloomy and\r\nheartless doctrine; but probably nothing more is meant than a refinement\r\nof the common adage, 'Misery loves company,' and that very good and\r\nbenevolent persons, if themselves overtaken by misfortune, can not but\r\nfeel some alleviation for their sorrows, in reflecting that others have\r\ntrials equally great and that they are but partakers of a common though\r\nbitter lot. If there be really any consolation in reflections of this\r\nkind, history furnishes us many striking examples, and, as far as great\r\nchanges in worldly condition are concerned, the prince and the plebeian,\r\nthe emperor and the exile, have often found themselves for a time on the\r\nsame level.\r\n\r\nThe wheel of fortune, in its revolutions, generally produces changes of\r\ntwo descriptions, either exalting the lowly or pulling down the great.\r\nIn rarer instances, not satisfied with giving the individual a single\r\nturn, it grants him the benefit of a more varied experience. It carries\r\nthe country-boy to wealth and power, and then transports him back to his\r\nnative fields, whose pure air is not less wholesome, after all, than the\r\nheated atmosphere of the ball-room or caucus-chamber; or it may roll the\r\nwave of revolution over a kingdom, banishing the prince to wander an\r\nexile, perhaps a schoolmaster, in distant lands, to contend with poverty\r\nor duns, and then, on its receding tide, landing him once more safely on\r\nhis throne. Frequent revolutions have, however, taught princes wisdom in\r\nthis respect. Most of them now seem to be well provided for in foreign\r\ncountries, beyond the reach of contingencies in their own, and if time\r\nis given them to escape with their lives, it is generally found that\r\nthey have 'laid up treasure' where at any rate the thieves of the new\r\ndynasty can not 'break through and steal.' A very recent instance is\r\nafforded us by his majesty Faustin I., who, notwithstanding his\r\nconfidence in the affection of his subjects, seems to have preferred\r\ntaking the Bank of England as collateral security.\r\n\r\nThe first French Revolution probably affords as striking examples of\r\nchange in worldly condition as any other period, and among those whom it\r\naffected for the time, few were more remarkable than two persons whom it\r\nsent to our own shores, Talleyrand and Chateaubriand. During the\r\nresidence of the former in Philadelphia, he appears at one time to have\r\nbeen in the most abject poverty. We read of his pawning a watch and\r\nsmaller articles, to provide himself and his companion with food; any\r\ncare for their wardrobes, beyond the faded garments they were then\r\nwearing, being apparently out of the question. If one who then met the\r\nneedy foreigner walking the wide streets of that respectable city, had\r\npredicted that in a few years this shabby Frenchman would be looked up\r\nto as the leader of the diplomacy of Europe, he might with perfect\r\njustice have been regarded as a fit subject for one of that city's\r\nexcellent asylums. But a few years did witness this change, and saw him\r\npowerful and the possessor of millions; unfortunately for the Abbé's\r\nreputation, much of the latter being the wages of corruption.[C]\r\n\r\nChateaubriand speaks feelingly of the sufferings he and his companion\r\nunderwent in London, about the same period. Lodged in a dismal garret,\r\nthey were at one time obliged to economize their food almost as closely\r\nas the inhabitants of a beleaguered town. He speaks of walking the\r\nstreets for hours together, utterly uncertain what to do, passing\r\nstately houses and groups of blooming English children, and then\r\nreturning late at night to his attic, where his companion, 'trembling\r\nwith cold,' would rise from his ill-clad bed to open the door for him.\r\nHe strikingly contrasts his position then with his approach to London\r\ntwenty years later, as ambassador from France, driving in\r\ncoach-and-four through towns whose authorities came out to welcome him\r\nin the usual pompous manner, and, while in London, giving magnificent\r\nballs in one of the stately houses, and perhaps numbering among his\r\nguests some of the blooming children he had once passed, now expanded\r\ninto full-blown and gorgeous flowers of aristocracy. These are, of\r\ncourse, uncommon instances; but they teach that the most brilliant\r\npresent may have had the darkest past; that there is always ground for\r\nhope, and that the caprices of fortune, if we take no higher view of\r\nthem, are mysterious enough.\r\n\r\nThe man who has been overtaken by reverses, need not look far abroad to\r\nsee that a system of compensation is pretty generally dealt out in this\r\nlife. Set him adrift in the world, with scarcely a dollar; let him walk,\r\nalmost a beggar, through the same streets he once trod, a man of wealth,\r\nand it would be idle to assert that he will not be almost overwhelmed by\r\nthe force of bitter recollections. In proportion as other days were\r\nhappy, will these be miserable. As Dante has truly said, the memory of\r\nformer joys, so far from affording relief to the wretched, serves only\r\nto embitter the present, as they feel that these joys have forever\r\npassed away. But unless his lot be one of unusual calamity, as time\r\nblunts the keenest edge of sorrow, he must be devoid of both philosophy\r\nand religion, if he does not feel that life with a mere competence still\r\nhas many joys. It is unquestionably true that one's style of living has\r\nnot much to do with the sum of his happiness, though this is said with\r\nno disposition to undervalue even the luxuries of life. So far from the\r\nfinest houses in a city having the greatest air of comfort about them, I\r\nthink rather the reverse is the case. No dwellings have a snugger look\r\nthan many of the plain, two-story houses in all our cities; no children\r\nmerrier than those that play around their doors; no manlier fathers than\r\nthose that struggle bravely for their support. One would suppose that\r\nStafford House, with its wealth of pictures and furniture, and its\r\nbeautiful views over Hyde Park, must contain much to add to the pleasure\r\nof its possessors; but probably the sum of happiness enjoyed by this\r\nnoble family has been very little increased by these things. I believe\r\nthat palaces are more envied by 'outsiders' than enjoyed by their\r\nowners. In proportion to the number of each, probably far more of those\r\ndreadful tragedies that cast ineffaceable gloom over whole families,\r\nhave occurred in these splendid houses than in plainer ones. Our Fifth\r\nAvenue, with all its grandeur, is one of the gloomiest looking streets\r\nin the world, as strangers generally remark. But as all preaching is\r\nvain against many a besetting sin, so will all the talking in the world\r\ndo little to convince men that happiness does not lie in externals. One\r\ngeneration does not learn much from its predecessors in this respect; it\r\nseems to have been intended that each should acquire its own experience.\r\nThe task of talking beforehand is therefore an unprofitable one; but it\r\nis a satisfaction to feel that when much that is thought indispensable\r\nhas been taken from us, there still remains that which can afford us\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to recall instances in which it seemed as if adversity was\r\nreally required to bring out the noblest qualities in man, and enable\r\nhim to set an example calculated to console and stimulate those who are\r\ntreading the sometimes difficult path of duty. Portions of the diary of\r\nScott, written during the last and most troubled years of his life, have\r\nfor many a deeper interest than the most brilliant pages of his novels.\r\nIn these days of 'compromise,' which seems to be too often the cant term\r\nfor an eternal adieu to all previous obligations, no matter how just,\r\nand no matter what good fortune the future may have in reserve for the\r\ndebtor, it is refreshing to read this record of perfect integrity and\r\nlong-continued sacrifice. Though carried, in his case, to a point beyond\r\nthe strictest requirements of honor, inasmuch as it involved the ruin of\r\nhis health, the example is noble and strengthening. It may be said, on\r\nthe other hand, that Scott was the possessor of a 'magic wand,' and did\r\nright in attempting what to other men would be impossible. Carlyle, if I\r\nremember his article, attributes Scott's conduct partly to worldly\r\npride, and thinks he should have owned at once that he had made a great\r\nmistake, involving others in his ruin, and should have abandoned the\r\ntremendous struggle still to bear up under such a weight. This is a\r\nsingular view of the matter, and one that a man of Scott's sense of\r\nhonor never would have felt satisfied in taking. The lives of Scott and\r\nCharlotte Bronté are worth more than their novels, after all.\r\n\r\nOne of the minor evils of loss of fortune has, I think, been\r\nexaggerated, and that is the idea that persons are frequently slighted,\r\nsometimes even cut, by their fashionable acquaintances; and connected\r\nwith this is the other idea, that what some sneeringly call 'fashionable\r\nsociety,' is generally more heartless than any other. For the honor of\r\nhuman nature, I am glad to believe that the first is not the case, nor\r\ndoes the second exactly stand to reason. In every city, there is a class\r\nof persons, moneyed or not as the case may be, who, living only for\r\nselfish enjoyment, pay court to those that can yield it to them, and are\r\nsometimes rude enough to slight those who can not. Whether the\r\ncompanionship of such persons is very desirable, or their loss much to\r\nbe deplored, each man must decide for himself. Persons who, when rich\r\nthemselves, have been overbearing to others, are perhaps those who\r\nnotice most difference when misfortunes overtake them. What is called\r\nfashionable society, generally comprises a good deal of the education\r\nand refinement of a city; with a portion of what is hollow and\r\nworthless, it includes much that is substantial and true. Certainly, the\r\nfiner and more delicate feelings of our nature, and those which lead us\r\nto sympathize with the unfortunate, are partly the result of education,\r\nand we should naturally expect to find these in the higher rather than\r\nin the humbler walks of life. There is a vast deal of genuine charity in\r\nhumble life, and the poor of every city derive a large part of their\r\nsupport from those but moderately blessed with worldly goods themselves;\r\nbut many a well-meaning man will unintentionally make a remark that\r\nwounds your feelings and makes you uncomfortable for hours afterwards,\r\nwhile a person whose perceptions and sympathies have been more nicely\r\ntrained would spare you the infliction. A certain fortune is\r\nindispensable to those who wish to keep with the party-going world, and\r\nthose who have not this competence can not indulge much in this more\r\nexpensive mode of life; but that they are forgotten is not because\r\npersons wish to neglect them, but because men naturally forget those\r\nthey are not often in the habit of meeting. Might not the aged, even if\r\nwealthy, say they are forgotten, excepting by their immediate\r\nconnection? They are forgotten because, in the rush and turmoil of life,\r\nevery thing is soon forgotten. The dead, who were beloved and honored\r\nwhile living, are soon comparatively forgotten beyond their families and\r\nfamiliar circle. This is not exactly owing to the heartlessness of men,\r\nbut rather to the fact that their minds are occupied with the persons\r\nand things they see every day around them, and this is probably as much\r\nthe case with the poor as with the rich; but it seems to have become a\r\nsort of custom to speak of the heartlessness of society. It is rather\r\nowing to the imperfection of our constitution. Loss of fortune renders\r\nus more sensitive, and we are apt to fancy slights where none were\r\nintended; but we may be pretty certain that the better men and women of\r\nsociety do not make money the index of their treatment of others.\r\n\r\nPersons sometimes speak lightly and hastily of reverses sustained by\r\nothers as mere trifles, compared with loss of friends. I hold that these\r\npersons are wrong, and believe that to many, and those not particularly\r\nselfish and narrow-minded people either, loss of fortune may prove a\r\ngreater and more lasting sorrow than loss of dear friends; nay, that a\r\ngreat reverse, such as a plunge from prosperity into utter poverty, (and\r\nmany such instances can be cited,) is perhaps the heaviest trial that\r\ncan be imposed on man. Let any one call up the instances he has known of\r\nthe tenderest ties being severed, and except in those rare cases we\r\nsometimes meet with of persons pining away and following the beloved\r\nobject to the grave, do we not see the overwhelming grief gradually\r\nsubsiding into a gentler sorrow, and, as was intended by a merciful\r\nprovidence, other objects closing in, and though not entirely filling up\r\nthe void, still furnishing other sources of happiness? This happens with\r\nthe best and tenderest beings on earth. The departed one is not\r\nforgotten, nor have the survivors ceased to mourn him; but their\r\nfeelings now cling more affectionately than before to the remaining\r\nmembers of the circle. This is not so in the case of a reverse such as I\r\nhave imagined, and many of us have seen. Where, as in the failure of\r\nsome great bank or 'Life and Trust Company,' reckoned perfectly\r\nimpregnable, the fortune of delicate ladies, always accustomed to\r\nluxury, has been swept away; where there are no relatives able or\r\nwilling to render much assistance, and daughters have to seek employment\r\nthat will give themselves and an aged mother a bare competence, with all\r\nmy disposition to bear things bravely and philosophically, I contend\r\nthat human nature can hardly be visited with a heavier trial. For men,\r\nit is comparatively easy; but there are instances, in every large city,\r\nof ladies, once wealthy, now reduced to a sort of genteel beggary, that\r\na man would shrink from, but that women can not very well avoid. Fancy\r\nthe bitterness of such a life; the constant memory of happier days\r\ncontrasted with the present condition, which has no prospect of\r\nimprovement; the keenness of present sorrow rendered more acute by\r\neducation and refinement; the necessity not merely of economy, for most\r\nof us can bear a large portion of this pretty cheerfully; but the\r\ndifficulty, with close economy, of supplying the decent comforts of\r\nlife, and tell me, as some who have never been visited by any trial of\r\nthis kind would tell me, if it is selfish and sordid to compare this\r\nlasting sorrow with that great ordinance of death and separation which\r\nall must share alike? Alas! these are objects not generally reached by\r\ncharitable societies; but not less deserving, and subjected to trials no\r\nless hard than those whose lot has always been one of poverty.\r\n\r\nHaving admitted that, under some circumstances, the loss of property may\r\noccasion grief so deep and lasting as to make it worthy of comparison\r\neven with loss of dear friends, I would say, on the other hand, that\r\ninstances often occur where no comparison can be made between the two\r\nevils. We hear sometimes of dreadful calamities at sea, where entire\r\nfamilies are swept away; where, as on the 'Austria,' the only\r\nalternative is the _mode_ of death, whether it shall be on the burning\r\nship or beneath the cold, dark billow. What experience can be more\r\nawful, in the life of any man, than that which compelled this father to\r\nthrow child after child into the sea, not with any hope of rescue, but\r\nmerely to prolong for a few moments a life that could no longer be\r\nendured on the burning deck? Different, but scarcely less painful, the\r\nburial of hope in a father's breast, as in the death of the sons of\r\nHallam. Industry may repair the wrecks of fortune; but the hopes and\r\naffections that have centered here must be laid aside forever.\r\n\r\nAre there many of us, after all, who would care for a career of unbroken\r\nprosperity? Men of talent and worth have been crushed and hurried to\r\ntheir graves by the iron hand of poverty; but for one such, there have\r\nprobably been ten who have passed through life with energies and talents\r\nnever fully called forth; because easy circumstances have never demanded\r\nany great exertion from them. This leaves out a class larger probably\r\nin our country than in any other, of children of fortune, who have\r\nplunged headlong into ruin, finding an early and dishonored death, who,\r\nhad they been compelled to work, would at least have acquitted\r\nthemselves decently in life. Some of the most dreadful death-scenes on\r\nrecord are those of men who have had few earthly trials to bear, men of\r\nwealth, who have wrought their own ruin, and half of whose lives have\r\nbeen passed in efforts to work the ruin of the young and innocent of the\r\nother sex. If Chatterton and Otway are sad instances of genius subdued\r\nand crushed by adversity, Beckford and many others show where the too\r\nlavish gifts of fortune have perverted talent and rendered its possessor\r\nfar worse than a merely useless member of society.\r\n\r\nThe world-wide Burns Celebration probably caused many humble men to\r\nthink of the number of great minds who have been compelled to undergo\r\nthis ordeal of poverty. How perfectly, in some instances, does the man's\r\nsoul and intellect seem to have been separated from _the man himself_.\r\nIt does seem a marvel that seventy years ago _this_ man should have been\r\nin want and harassed by fears for the family he was to leave behind him,\r\nwhen now so many hundred thousand men seem ready to worship him. How\r\nmany envy fame! and how proud men are, for generations afterward, who\r\ncan trace back their descent to one who, while on earth, may have\r\nsuffered all the annoyances and discomforts of penury! The poet seemed\r\nto know that he would be more highly esteemed after he had left the\r\nworld than while he was in it; but did this thought really afford him\r\nmuch consolation, or would he have been willing, if possible, to\r\nsacrifice a more prosperous present for a great posthumous fame? How\r\nmany great men have languished long years in dungeons, as some languish\r\nin them even now. How many have borne years of bodily infirmity. How\r\nmany have died just as they seemed about to realize the fruit of years\r\nof preparation and exertion. These reflections tend to make us contented\r\nwith a comparatively humble lot, as all great trials tend to lessen our\r\nundue attachment to life.\r\n\r\nFinally, it occurs to me that very few men have lost fortunes, without\r\nspending too much time in unavailing regrets that they should have lost\r\nthem just in the manner they did. If they had only avoided this or that\r\nparticular investment, all would have been well. This is nonsense.\r\nUndoubtedly, a great deal of money is lost very foolishly, but though no\r\nfatalist, I do not believe that all the care and prudence in the world\r\nwill materially alter the great Scriptural law, that the riches of this\r\nworld will often take wings to themselves and flee away. There is far\r\ntoo much recklessness, far too much of what is called in business\r\ncircles 'expansion;' but the time will never come, in our country, when\r\ngeneration after generation, in one family, will keep on in the path of\r\nsuccess. Great fortunes will still melt away, and the shrewdest maxims\r\nof those who built them up will fail sometimes. Nothing can be\r\nconsidered certain in regard to worldly goods, beyond the fact that\r\nindustry, good principles, and average capacity will always, in the long\r\nrun, secure a competence; but wealth will still be the prize that only a\r\nfew need expect to draw.\r\n\r\nI have endeavored to call up a few of the reflections that may console a\r\nman under adversity, remembering that drooping fortunes may revive, that\r\nmany of the noblest men have suffered the same privations, and\r\nremembering how much lighter this form of affliction generally is than\r\nsome others that Providence often sees fit to lay upon us. Trite as it\r\nis, I can not help echoing the remark, how vastly the sum of human\r\nhappiness would be increased, if men could only learn to prize more\r\nhighly the blessings they have. Those of us who are in moderate\r\ncircumstances find it so much easier to envy our rich neighbors than to\r\nthink with gratitude of our happy lot, contrasted with the many thousand\r\nof our needier brethren. We enjoy so many blessings, that we become\r\nunmindful of them. We rarely think at all about our health, until a few\r\ndays' sickness reminds us of the boon we have been enjoying so\r\nunconsciously. In the darkest days of the great crisis, accounts reached\r\nus every week from India, telling us that refined and delicately-reared\r\nEnglish men and women were being brutally slaughtered or exposed to the\r\nloathsome horrors of a lingering siege. What a paradise the humblest\r\ncottage at home would have seemed to these poor creatures, though some\r\nof them had been accustomed to 'stately homes.'\r\n\r\nHow beautifully this sentiment of gratitude for the common blessings of\r\nlife has been expressed by Emile Souvestre, one of the purest and\r\nnoblest writers of our time, and one whose early history presents an\r\ninstance of great obstacles and trials nobly met and overcome!\r\n\r\n'If a little dry sand be all that is left us, may we not still make it\r\nblossom with the small joys we now trample under foot. Ah! if it be the\r\nwill of God, let my labor be still more hard, my home less comfortable,\r\nmy table more frugal; let me even assume a workman's blouse, and I can\r\nbear it all willingly and cheerfully, provided I can see the loved faces\r\naround me happy, provided I can feast upon their smiles and strengthen\r\nmyself with their joy. O holy contentment with poverty! it is thy\r\npresence I invoke. Grant me the cheerful gayety of my wife, the free,\r\nunrestrained laughter of my children, and take in exchange, if\r\nnecessary, all that is yet left me.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE MOLLY O'MOLLY PAPERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNO. III.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Dogberry brought Conrade before Leonato, the only offense he seems\r\nto have had a clear idea of, was the one against himself: 'Moreover,\r\nsir, this plaintiff here, the offender, did call me ass. I beseech you,\r\nlet it be remembered in his punishment.' Shakspeare has, by this 'one\r\ntouch of nature,' made Dogberry kin to the whole world. It would be the\r\nmost terrible of punishments to run the gauntlet of a company, every one\r\nof which you had called an ass; whatever may have been the original\r\noffense, this would be the one most remembered in your punishment, I\r\ndon't think it would be possible to believe any thing good of one who\r\nhad given you this appellation; on the contrary, the reputed long ears\r\nwould be worse than the famous 'diabolical trumpet' for collecting and\r\ndistorting the merest whispers of evil against him who planted them, or\r\ndiscovered them peeping through the assumed lion's skin. Apollo's music\r\nprobably sounded no sweeter to Midas after he received his 'wonderful\r\near.'\r\n\r\nBut my object in introducing Dogberry was not to give a dissertation on\r\nthis greatest of insults, but to illustrate our selfishness. Our\r\npatience will bear great _crimes_ against others, but how it gives way\r\nunder the slightest _insult_ to ourselves. Now I am not going to\r\ndenounce selfishness; I'd as soon think of denouncing gravitation. There\r\nis, in the best of us, an under-current of selfishness; indeed,\r\nselfishness and unselfishness are convertible terms; this is a higher\r\nkind of that, as the upper-current of the ocean is but the under-current\r\nrisen to the surface.\r\n\r\nSaint James says: 'The love of money is the root of all evil.' I am not\r\nexactly prepared to agree with him; it is a great branch, almost the\r\ntrunk; but I think selfishness is the root. You know Hahnemann thought\r\nall diseases but a modification of one disease--_psora_. However it may\r\nbe with his theory, the one moral disease is not an itching palm. This\r\nis but a modification of selfishness, which is not merely cutaneous.\r\n\r\nBut the form it is supposed to take in the system of Yankees, is the\r\nabove-named plebeian form. The supposition may be correct. Don't we most\r\nfeel our national troubles, the shock of the great national earthquake,\r\nwhen it causes an upheaval from the depths of the pocket? If Uncle Sam's\r\nsentiments are, as they are supposed to be, only a concentration of\r\nthose of the majority, isn't his lamentation over his run-away South,\r\nwho has changed her name without his consent, that of Shylock: 'My\r\ndaughter! Oh! my ducats!'? Though not exactly connected with this branch\r\nof selfishness, I may as well, while speaking of our national\r\ndifficulties, mention what struck me very forcibly: It is said, that on\r\nthe eminence from which the spectators of the Bull Run battle so\r\nprecipitately fled, were found sandwiches and bottles of wine; and that\r\nthese refreshments actually lined the road to Washington. From this\r\nmight be inferred that 'to-day's dinner' not only 'subtends a larger\r\nvisual angle than _yesterday's_ revolution,' but that it also subtends a\r\nlarger angle than _to-day's_ revolution. If one could ever forget one's\r\nown personal gratifications and comforts, it would be, I should think,\r\nin overlooking a nation's battle-field--_our_ nation's battle-field. But\r\nit is not for a humble lay member, whose business it is to practice\r\nrather than preach, to criticise. Are not the honorable members\r\nrepresentatives of the people; and when they are cheered and refreshed,\r\nare not the 'dear people' through them cheered and refreshed? Besides,\r\nthey may have so reluctantly dropped the wine and sandwiches because\r\nthey were loth to leave them to 'give aid and comfort to the enemy.'\r\nThere are always envious people to rail at those above them; pawns on\r\nthe world's chess-board, they pride themselves on their own\r\nstraightforward course; but let them push their way to the highest row,\r\nhow soon do they exchange this course for the 'crooked policy of the\r\nknight,' or jump over principles with queen, castle, or bishop! Woe to\r\nthe poor pawn in their way.\r\n\r\nHow I have skipped! what connection can there be between members of\r\nCongress and crooked policy, or jumping over principles? yet there must\r\nhave been a train of association that led me off the track; doubtless it\r\nwas purely arbitrary. Well, we'll let it go; poor pawn as I am, I have\r\nbut stepped aside to nab an idea.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the Yankee. The form which selfishness takes in his\r\nsystem is not that of the most intensified exclusiveness. You know the\r\nstory of Rosicrucius' sepulcher, with its ever-burning lamp, guarded by\r\nan armor-encased, truncheon-armed statue, which statue, on the entrance\r\nof a man who accidentally discovered the sepulcher, arose, and at his\r\nadvance, raised its truncheon and shivered the lamp to atoms, leaving\r\nthe intruder in darkness. On examination, under the floor springs were\r\nfound, connecting with others within the statue. Rosicrucius wished thus\r\nto inform the world that he had reïnvented the ever-burning lamp of the\r\nancients, but meant that the world shouldn't profit by the information.\r\nHad a Yankee reïnvented those lamps, he would have got out a patent, and\r\nsome brother Yankee would have improved upon it, and invented one\r\nwarranted to burn 'forever _and a day_.' They would probably have thus\r\nraked together a great deal of the 'filthy lucre;' _possibly_ this would\r\nhave been their main object; but the world would have been benefited by\r\nthem. All selfishness, to be sure, but exclusive selfishness benefits\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n[Speaking of _filthy_ lucre, I begin to see why those who have lost it\r\nall are said to be '_cleaned_ out.' But this is only _par parenthèse_.]\r\n\r\nBut exclusiveness is not peculiar to the Rosicrucians; there is too much\r\nof it in even the religious sects of this enlightened age; it is too\r\nmuch, 'Lord, bless me and my sect;' 'Lord, bless us, and no more.'\r\nThere are self-constituted mountain-tops that would extract all the\r\nmercy and grace with which the winds come freighted from the great ocean\r\nof Love, so that they would pass over beyond them hot, dry winds of\r\nwrath. But I am glad that this is impossible; that in the moral world\r\nthere are no Andes, no rainless regions.\r\n\r\nI fear that I have not stuck very closely to the text furnished me by\r\nthick-headed, thick-tongued Dogberry.\r\n\r\nAllow me to compress into closing sentences, a few general remarks....\r\nThose lakes that have no outlet, grow salt and bitter; we all know the\r\nennui and bitterness of those souls that receive many blessings, sending\r\nforth none; better drain your soul out for others, than have it become a\r\n_Dead Sea_.... Black, that absorbs all rays, reflecting none, is an\r\nanomaly in nature; it is true, but one earthly character has reflected\r\nall the rays of goodness, absorbing none, making the common light 'rich,\r\nlike a lily in bloom;' yet every man can reflect at least one ray to\r\ngladden the earth.... It is not necessary, even in the cold atmosphere\r\nof this world, to become contractedly selfish; cold expands noble\r\nnatures as it does water.... Lastly ...\r\n\r\nYours, MOLLY O'MOLLY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNO. IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old trout knows enough to keep off the fisherman's hook; the\r\nsquirrel never cracks an empty nut; the crow soon learns the\r\nharmlessness of the scarecrow. But man, though he may have twenty times\r\nwriggled off the hook, the patient angler catches him at last. He always\r\ncracks the empty shell, then cries: 'Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.'\r\nThis cry he might be spared would he learn a lesson from the squirrel,\r\nwho weighs his nuts and throws away the light, hollow shell.... And\r\nthere are scarescrows, the harmlessness of which the human biped learns\r\nnot in a a lifetime. How long is it since that horned, cloven-footed\r\nmonster whom the monks made of Pan _theos_ and called him _Devil_, was\r\nan object of fear? How 'the real, genuine, no mistake' (savin' his\r\npresence) must have laughed at his own effigy! Then there is Grim Death,\r\ntoo, a creation of the Dark Ages, for in no age of light could this\r\nhorror have been ever conceived. Unlike the _other_, against him no\r\nexorcism avails.... As if the soul about to be launched on the dim sea\r\nEternity, after all lights and forms of the loved shore have become\r\nindistinct, must be cut loose from her moorings by this phantom. The\r\nidea that 'Death comes to set us free,' would hardly make us 'meet him\r\ncheerily, as our true friend,' were this his real shape. But were I\r\ndisposed to enumerate our scarecrows, the list would be incomplete; as\r\nthere are doubtless many that I have not the shrewdness to recognize as\r\nsuch.\r\n\r\nThe only humbugs are not those that work on our fears. There are humbugs\r\nthat work on our hopes. These have been likened to bubbles that dance on\r\nthe wave, burst, and are no more. They are too often like bomb-shells,\r\nthat in exploding scatter ruin on all around. They have also been named\r\nair-castles, _chateaux en Espagne_, 'baseless fabrics of a vision.' The\r\nbaseless fabric of a vision is built of 'airy nothingness;' but men\r\nfound on a wish, structures that tower to heaven, put real, solid\r\nmaterial into them, and when they fall, as fall they must--I'll not\r\nattempt to give an idea of the utter desolation they leave, of the\r\n_waste place_ they make of the heart, lest you should think I have thus\r\nhumbugged myself; for _self-humbug_ it certainly is; and this is the\r\nmost intensely _human_. Not a fish, or reptile, bird, or beast; not a\r\nthing crawling, swimming, flying, or walking, but the human creature,\r\nhumbugs himself. 'Man was made to mourn,' I would change into, Man was\r\nmade to be humbugged. It is better to be greatly gullible, than a\r\n'cunning dog,' for gulled we will be. It is better to be caught at once,\r\nthan to have our gills torn by wriggling off the hook the twenty times,\r\nto be caught at last. It is better to walk straight into the net than to\r\nfatigue ourselves by coming to it in a roundabout way. A Nova-Scotian\r\nonce rallied a Down-Easter on the famous wooden hams. 'Yaas,' was the\r\nreply, 'and they say that one of you actilly _ate_ one and didn't know\r\nthe difference.' Well, it is better to swallow our humbugs, as the\r\nNova-Scotian did the Connecticut-cured ham, without detecting any thing\r\npeculiar in their flavor, than it is to find our mistake at the first\r\ncut or _saw_. By the way, saltpeter is so needed for other purposes,\r\nthat probably the _Virginia cured_ will not now have as fine a flavor as\r\nformerly.\r\n\r\nBut, _in the way_: You dissent from some of these remarks? You've cut\r\nyour eye-teeth, have you? Possibly you forget that trip in the cars,\r\nwhen you 'cutely passed by the swell in flashy waistcoat and galvanized\r\njewelry, and took a seat by a 'plain blunt man' in snuff-color; and\r\nafter he had left the cars at the first station, and the conductor came\r\nto you and demanded, 'Your ticket, sir!' you probably forgot how in\r\nfumbling for it in your pocket, you found it, but _not_ your\r\nporte-monnaie. You perhaps set down in your mental memorandum, under the\r\nhead of Appearances, not to be deceived by plain bluntness and\r\nsnuff-color. There you were wrong; your boasted reason is of no avail in\r\ndetecting humbugs; there is no such thing as classifying them. Then,\r\ntoo, we are in greater danger of being humbugged by another class of\r\nappearances.\r\n\r\nIn material things we are compelled to acknowledge that things the most\r\nreliable are the most unpretending. The star, by which the mariner has\r\nsteered for ages, is not a 'bright particular star;' the needle of his\r\ncompass is shaped from one of the baser metals, (though in a figurative\r\nsense gold is highly magnetic.) The inner bears such a relation to the\r\nouter, that the inner senses are named from the outer; we are slow to\r\nperceive that also all objects of the outer senses, are but types of\r\nthose of the inner. You see how I have been obliged to borrow from the\r\nouter vocabulary. I give this idea, in a nebular state, trusting that\r\nyou will consolidate it. Were we, in a figurative sense, to choose a\r\nguiding-star, it would be a comet, we are so taken with flash and show.\r\nA great truth, though angels heralded its birth, and a star were drawn\r\nfrom its orbit to stand over its cradle, if that cradle were a manger,\r\nwe would reject it; if it assumed not the 'pomp and circumstance' of\r\nroyalty, though it worked miracles, we would cry, _Away with it_.\r\nEighteen hundred years have not completely transformed or transmuted the\r\nworld; we are yet ready to reject the true, and be humbugged by the\r\nfalse. More than eighteen hundred and sixty-two years may yet elapse\r\nbefore the bells that 'ring out the old and ring in the new,' will 'ring\r\nout the false and ring in the true.' Then farewell humbug.\r\n\r\nYes, it is altogether probable that long before humbug is no more, you\r\nand I will--I was about to say be in the narrow house, but prefer an\r\nexpression of Carlyle's--we will have 'vanished into infinite space.' I\r\nprefer this for the same reason that one of Hood's characters was\r\nthankful that 'Heaven was boundless.' She it was whom the physician\r\npronounced 'dying by inches.' 'Only think,' exclaimed the _consternated_\r\nhusband, 'how long she will be dying!' I suppose to the poor man Grim\r\nDeath appeared to hold in his skeleton fingers, instead of an\r\nhour-glass, a twenty-year glass.\r\n\r\nThat the sands of his glass may, for you, married or single, neither run\r\ntoo fast nor too slow, is sincerely the wish of\r\n\r\nYour well-wisher,\r\n\r\nMOLLY O'MOLLY.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nALL TOGETHER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Old friends and dear! it were ungentle rhyme,\r\n    If I should question of your true hearts, whether\r\n  Ye have forgotten that far, pleasant time,\r\n    The good old time when we were all together.\r\n\r\n  Our limbs were lusty and our souls sublime;\r\n    We never heeded cold and winter weather,\r\n  Nor sun nor travel, in that cheery time,\r\n    The brave old time when we were all together.\r\n\r\n  Pleasant it was to tread the mountain thyme;\r\n    Sweet was the pure and piny mountain ether,\r\n  And pleasant all; but this was in the time,\r\n    The good old time when we were all together.\r\n\r\n  Since then I've strayed through many a fitful clime,\r\n    (Tossed on the wind of fortune like a feather,)\r\n  And chanced with rare good fellows in my time;\r\n    But ne'er the time that we have known together:\r\n\r\n  But none like those brave hearts, (for now I climb\r\n    Gray hills alone, or thread the lonely heather,)\r\n  That walked beside me in the ancient time,\r\n    The good old time when we were all together.\r\n\r\n  Long since, we parted in our careless prime,\r\n    Like summer birds no June shall hasten hither;\r\n  No more to meet as in that merry time,\r\n    The sweet spring-time that shone on all together.\r\n\r\n  Some to the fevered city's toil and grime,\r\n    And some o'er distant seas, and some--ah! whither?\r\n  Nay, we shall never meet as in the time,\r\n    The dear old time when we were all together.\r\n\r\n  And some--above their heads, in wind and rime,\r\n    Year after year, the grasses wave and wither;\r\n  Ay, we shall meet!--'tis but a little time,\r\n    And all shall lie with folded hands together.\r\n\r\n  And if, beyond the sphere of doubt and crime,\r\n    Lie purer lands--ah! let our steps be thither;\r\n  That, done with earthly change and earthly time,\r\n    In God's good time we may be all together.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA TRUE STORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlone in the world! alone in the great city of Paris, a world in itself!\r\nalone, and with scarcely a livre in my purse!\r\n\r\nSuch were my reflections as I turned away from the now empty house, in\r\nwhich for two-and-twenty years I had dwelt with my poor, wasteful,\r\nuncalculating father. My father was a scholar of most stupendous\r\nattainments, particularly in Oriental literature, but a perfect child in\r\nall that related to the ordinary affairs of life. Absorbed in his\r\nstudies, he let his pecuniary matters take care of themselves.\r\nConsequently, when death suddenly laid him low, and deprived me of my\r\nonly friend and protector, his affairs were found to be in a state of\r\ninextricable confusion. His effects, including the noble library of\r\nEastern lore which it had been the labor of his life to collect, were\r\nseized, and sold to pay his debts, and were found insufficient.\r\n\r\nMy mother had died when I was a child, and my father had educated me\r\nhimself, pouring into my young and eager mind the treasures of knowledge\r\nhe possessed. I was--I say it without boasting--a prodigy of learning;\r\nbut in all that relates to domestic economy, as well as to the ordinary\r\nattainments of woman, I was as ignorant as my father himself.\r\n\r\nI lingered in the house until the sale was over and the last cart-load\r\nof goods had been removed. Then I repaired to a wretched garret in the\r\nRue du Temple, where I had found a refuge, and where I designed to\r\nremain until such time as I could, by the exercise of my talents,\r\nreplenish my purse and procure a better lodging. Here I sat down, took a\r\ncalm survey of my position, and questioned myself as to what employment\r\nI was fit for.\r\n\r\nOf the usual feminine accomplishments, I possessed none. I could neither\r\ndraw nor paint; I could not play a note of music on any instrument; I\r\ncould sing, it is true, but knew nothing of the science of vocal music;\r\nI did not know a word of Spanish, or Italian, or German, or English;\r\neven with the literature of France I was but little acquainted; but I\r\ncould read the cuneiform characters of Babylon and Persepolis as readily\r\nas you read this page, while Sanscrit, Hebrew, Arabic, Syriac, and\r\nChaldaic, flowed from my tongue as freely as a nursery rhyme. As an\r\ninstructress of young ladies, therefore, I could not hope to find a\r\nlivelihood, but as an assistant to some learned man or body of men, I\r\nknew that my attainments would be invaluable.\r\n\r\nFull of hope, therefore, and with a cheerful heart, I set about\r\nobtaining a situation.\r\n\r\nHearing that the Oriental department of the Bibliothèque du Roi was\r\nabout to undergo some alterations, and that an assistant librarian was\r\nwanted to reärrange and re-catalogue the books, I applied at once for\r\nthe situation. I was closely examined as to my qualifications, and much\r\nsurprise manifested at the proficiency I had attained in these unwonted\r\nstudies; but my application was refused, because--I was a woman.\r\n\r\nI next answered by letter the advertisement of a distinguished _savant_\r\nwho was about to undertake the translation of the Sacred Vedas, and was\r\nin want of an amanuensis. To this I received the following reply:\r\n\r\n    'MADEMOISELLE: If your attainments in Sanscrit are such as you\r\n    represent them, I am convinced that you would exactly suit me,\r\n    were you a young man. But I am a bachelor; there is not a single\r\n    female in my establishment; your sex, therefore, renders it\r\n    impossible for me to employ you as my amanuensis.'\r\n\r\n_My sex_ again! Discouraged, but not daunted, I applied successively to\r\nthe Société Asiatique, to the librarian of the Institute, and to three\r\nor four private individuals of more or less note. From all of them I\r\nreceived the same answer--the situation was not open to women.\r\n\r\nMeantime the few francs I had had at my father's death vanished, one by\r\none. The woman from whom I hired my room became clamorous for the rent.\r\nI had a few superfluous articles of clothing. I disposed of them at the\r\nMont-de-Piété, and thus kept the wolf from the door a little longer.\r\nWhen they were all gone, what should I do?\r\n\r\nI persevered in my quest for employment. It was all in vain. Many people\r\nadded insults to their harsh refusal of my application, accusing me of\r\nbeing an impostor; for who ever heard, said they, of a young girl like\r\nme being acquainted with these abstruse studies! Day after day, week\r\nafter week, I plodded on through the mire and dirt, for it was winter,\r\nthe weeping winter of Paris, and the obscure and narrow streets\r\n(traversed by a filthy kennel in the center, and destitute of sidewalks)\r\nthrough which my researches led me, were in a dreadful condition. And\r\nevermore the question recurred to me, What shall I do?\r\n\r\nAs day after day passed, and still no opening appeared, I thought of the\r\nriver, rolling darkly through the heart of the city, in whose silent\r\ntide so many a poor unfortunate has sought a refuge from present misery.\r\nOne day, as in the course of my peregrinations I passed the Morgue, I\r\nsaw the dead body of a young woman which had been taken that morning\r\nfrom the river, and laid out for recognition by her friends. As I looked\r\non her livid, bloated face, her drenched and tattered garments, her long\r\ndark hair hanging in dank matted masses, and streaming over the edge of\r\nthe table on which she lay, my heart was moved with pity. Yet I half\r\nenvied her position, and might have followed her example, but for my\r\nbelief in a future state. Her body was free from every mortal ill, but\r\nher poor soul, where was it?\r\n\r\nBut besides, looking at it from a merely human point of view, there is\r\nin my nature a certain stern and rugged resolution, a sort of\r\n'never-give-up' feeling, which induces me to hope and struggle on, and\r\nleads me to think, with the great Napoleon, that suicide is the act of a\r\ncoward, since it is an attempt to fly from those evils which God has\r\nlaid upon us, rather than to bear them with a brave, enduring trust in\r\nProvidence.\r\n\r\nStill, as I passed by the river, spanned by its noble bridges, and\r\ncovered with those innumerable barges in which the washerwomen of Paris\r\nply their unceasing trade, eating, sleeping, and living constantly in\r\ntheir floating dwellings, I would think, with a shudder, that unless\r\nrelief soon arrived, I must choose between its silent waters and a\r\nlingering death by starvation.\r\n\r\nTrue, there are in Paris many employments open to women, but what was\r\nthat to me? Could I stand behind a counter and set forth with a glib\r\ntongue the merits of ribbons and laces; or bend over the rich\r\nembroidered robe of the fashionable lady; or even, like those poor\r\nwasherwomen, earn my scanty livelihood by arduous manual labor? I knew\r\nnothing of business; I knew nothing of embroidery; and I had neither the\r\nstrength nor the capital necessary to set up the establishment of a\r\n_blanchicheuse_.\r\n\r\nI had returned home, one evening, after another weary tramp. As I looked\r\nfrom my lofty attic, and saw Paris glittering with her million lights, I\r\nsaid to myself: 'Must I perish of hunger in these streets? Must I starve\r\nin the midst of that abundance which might be mine but for the fact that\r\nI am _a woman_? No! I shall abjure my sex, and in the semblance of\r\nthemselves, win from men that subsistence which they deny to a woman.'\r\n\r\nThe thought was no sooner conceived than executed. Tearing off part of\r\nmy woman's attire, I threw around me an old cloak of my father's, which\r\nnow served as a coverlet to my lowly bed, and descended the long flights\r\nof stairs to the street. Determined to have legal sanction for what I\r\nwas about to do, I went straight to the Prefecture of Police. It was not\r\nyet very late, and the Prefect was still in his _bureau_. I entered his\r\npresence, told him my story, and demanded permission to put on male\r\nattire, and assume a masculine name, in order to obtain the means of\r\nsubsistence. He heard me respectfully, treated me kindly, and advised me\r\nto ponder well before I took a step so unusual and unseemly. But I was\r\nfirm. Seeing my determination, he granted me a written permission.\r\n\r\nEarly next morning I took what remained of my feminine wardrobe and\r\nhastened to the Marché de Vieux Linge, (old clothes market,) which was\r\nnot far distant from my place of abode. Built on the site of the ancient\r\nTemple, the princely residence of the Knights Templar of old, and in\r\nlater times the prison of Louis XVI. previous to his execution--this\r\nvast market, with its eighteen hundred and eighty-eight stalls, hung\r\nwith the cast-off garments of both sexes, and of every age, condition\r\nand clime, presents the appearance of a miniature city. Men's apparel,\r\nwomen's apparel, garments for children of all sizes, boots and shoes,\r\nhats and bonnets, tawdry finery of every description, sheets and\r\nblankets, carpets, tattered and stained, military accouterments, swords\r\nand belts, harness, old pots and kettles, and innumerable other\r\narticles, attract attention in the different stalls. There, on every\r\nside, sharp-faced and shrill-voiced dealers haggle with timid customers\r\nover garments more or less decayed. There the adroit thief finds a ready\r\nmarket for the various articles he has procured from chamber and entry,\r\nor purloined from the pockets of the unwary. There the petted lady's\r\nmaid disposes of the rich robe which her careless mistress has given\r\nher, and the Parisian grisette, with the money her nimble fingers have\r\nearned, purchases it to adorn her neat and pretty form for the _Bal paré\r\net masqué_, to which her lover takes her, at Belleville or Montmartre.\r\nIn yonder stall hangs a tattered coat which once belonged to a marquis,\r\nbut has gone through so many hands since then, and accumulated so much\r\ndirt and grease in the process, that one wonders how the dealer would\r\nhave ventured to advance the few sous which its last wretched owner had\r\nraised upon it.\r\n\r\nIn this place I exchanged, without much difficulty, my female\r\nhabiliments for a suit of respectable masculine attire. I took it home,\r\nand with a feeling of shame of which I could not get rid, but yet with\r\nunflinching resolution, arrayed myself in it. As a woman I know I am not\r\nhandsome; my mouth is large and my skin dark; but this rather favored my\r\ndisguise; for had I been very pretty, my beardless face and weak voice\r\nmight have awakened more suspicion. I cut my hair off short, parted it\r\nat one side, brushed it with great care, and crowned it with a jaunty\r\ncap, which, I must say, was very becoming to me. In this dress I\r\nappeared a tolerably well-looking youth of nineteen or thereabout, for\r\nthe change of garments made me look younger than I was.\r\n\r\nAs I surveyed myself in the little cracked looking-glass which served me\r\nas a mirror, I could not forbear laughing at the transformation.\r\nCertainly no one would have recognized me, for I could scarcely\r\nrecognize myself.\r\n\r\nFolding the old cloak around me, I sallied forth. With the long, thick\r\nbraid of hair I had cut from my head, I purchased a breakfast, the best\r\nI had eaten in a long time.\r\n\r\nThen I went direct to the residence of the gentleman who had said I\r\nwould suit him exactly, if I were a young man. There had been something\r\nin the tone of this gentleman's letter that attracted me, I could not\r\ntell why. To my great joy, he had not yet found the person he wanted;\r\nand after a short conversation he engaged me, at what seemed to me a\r\nprincely salary.\r\n\r\nHe told me laughingly that a young woman had applied for the situation a\r\nshort time previous; and seemed very much amused at the circumstance.\r\n\r\nMy employer was a man already past his prime. His hair was slightly\r\nsprinkled with gray, and his form showed that tendency to fullness so\r\nfrequently found in persons of sedentary habits. But in his fine,\r\nthoughtful eyes, and expansive brow, one saw evidence of that noble\r\nintellect for which he was distinguished, while his beaming smile and\r\npleasant voice showed a genial and benevolent heart. The kindness of his\r\nvoice and manner went straight to my lonely and desolate heart, and\r\naffected me so much that I almost disgraced my manhood by bursting into\r\ntears.\r\n\r\nHe occupied a modest but commodious house in the Quartier Latin. His\r\ndomestic affairs were administered by a respectable-looking elderly man,\r\nwho performed the part of cook, to his own honor and the entire\r\nsatisfaction of his master; while a smart but mischievous imp of a boy\r\nran of errands, tended the fires, swept the rooms, and kept old\r\nDominique in a continual fret, by his tricks and his short-comings.\r\n\r\nHere, in the well-furnished library of my new master, with every\r\nconvenience for annotation and elucidation, the translation of the Vedas\r\nwas commenced. Like my father, my employer was possessed of vast\r\nerudition; but, unlike him, he was also a man of the world, high in\r\nfavor at court, wealthy, honored, and enjoying the friendship of all the\r\nmost noted savans and other celebrities of the metropolis. During the\r\nprogress of the work some of these would occasionally enter the study\r\nwhere I sat writing almost incessantly, and I saw more than one to whom\r\nI had applied in the days of my misery, and been rejected. But happily\r\nno one recognized me.\r\n\r\nMy kind master expressed great astonishment at my proficiency in\r\nSanscrit, and frequently declared my services to be invaluable to him. I\r\nwas sometimes able to render a passage which he had given up as\r\nintractable; and he more than once asserted that my name should appear\r\non the title-page as well as his own. My name? Alas! I had no name.\r\n\r\nMy master frequently chid me for my unceasing devotion to my work; and\r\nwould sometimes playfully come behind, as I sat writing, snatch the\r\nmanuscript from my desk, and substitute in its place some new and\r\npopular book, or some time-honored French classic, to which he would\r\ncommand me to give my whole attention for the next two hours, on pain of\r\nhis displeasure.\r\n\r\nHis kindness to me knew no bounds. He ordered Dominique and the boy Jean\r\nto treat me with as much respect as himself. He took me with him to the\r\nOriental lectures of the Bibliothèque du Roi. He procured for me the\r\n_entrée_ to the discussions of several literary and scientific bodies,\r\nand afforded me every facility for the improvement of my mind and the\r\ndevelopment of my powers. He introduced me to all that was noblest and\r\nbest in the great aristocracy of intellect, and constantly spoke of me\r\nas a young man of great promise, who would one day be heard of in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nHe used to rally me on my studious habits, and often expressed surprise\r\nthat a young man of my years should not seek the society of his\r\ncompeers, and especially of that _other sex_, to which the heart of\r\nyouth usually turns with an irresistible, magnet-like attraction. Little\r\ndid he dream that the person he addressed belonged to that very sex of\r\nwhich he spoke.\r\n\r\nOne day he startled me by saying: 'What pretty hair you have, Eugene; it\r\nis as soft and fine as that of a young girl.'\r\n\r\nThe conscious blush rushed to my face, for I thought he had surely\r\ndiscovered my secret; but one glance at his calm countenance reassured\r\nme. In his large, open, honest heart there never entered a suspicion of\r\nthe 'base deception' that had been practiced upon him.\r\n\r\nHe did not notice my emotion, and I answered, in as calm a voice as I\r\ncould command: 'My mother had fine, soft hair; I have inherited it from\r\nher.'\r\n\r\nThus passed a year, the happiest I had ever known. My master became\r\nkinder and more affectionate every day. He would often address me as\r\n'_mon fils_,' and seemed indeed to regard me with feelings as warm as\r\nthose of a father to a son.\r\n\r\nAnd I--what were my sentiments toward this good and noble man who was so\r\nkind to me? I worshiped him; he was every thing to me. Father and mother\r\nwere gone, sisters and brothers I had none, other friends I had never\r\nknown. My master was all the world to me. To serve him was all I lived\r\nfor. To love him, though with a love that could never be known, never be\r\nreturned, was enough for me.\r\n\r\nI have said that I was happy; but there was one drawback to my\r\nhappiness. It lay in the self-reproach I felt for the deception\r\npracticed on my benefactor. Many times I resolved to resume my woman's\r\ngarments, (a suit of which I always kept by me, safe under lock and\r\nkey,) fall at his feet, and confess all. But the fear that he would\r\nspurn me, the certainty that he would drive me from his presence,\r\nrestrained me. I could not exist under his displeasure; I could not\r\nendure life away from him.\r\n\r\nAlthough he was, of course, unconscious of the intensity of the feeling\r\nwith which I regarded him, he knew--for I did not conceal it--that I was\r\nmuch attached to him; and I was aware that I, or rather Eugene, was very\r\ndear to him. On one occasion, as we sat together in the study, he said\r\nto me, abruptly:\r\n\r\n'How old are you, Eugene?'\r\n\r\n'Twenty-two,' I answered.\r\n\r\nHe sat silent for some moments; then he said:\r\n\r\n'If I had married in my early years, I might have had a son as old as\r\nyou. Take my advice, Eugene, marry early; form family ties; then your\r\nold age will not be lonely as mine is.'\r\n\r\n'O my dear master!' cried I, safe under my disguise, 'no son could love\r\nyou as dearly as I do. A son would leave you to win a place for himself\r\nin the world; but your faithful Eugene will cling to you through life;\r\nhe only asks to remain with you always--always.'\r\n\r\n'My good Eugene!' said my master, grasping my hand warmly, 'your words\r\nmake me happy. I am a lonely man, and the affection which you, a\r\nstranger youth, entertain for me, fills me with profound and heart-felt\r\njoy.'\r\n\r\nAh! then my trembling heart asked itself the question: 'What would he\r\nthink if he knew that it was a young girl who felt for him this pure and\r\ntender affection?' Something whispered me that he would be rather\r\npleased than otherwise, and a wild temptation seized me to tell him\r\nall--but I could not--I could not.\r\n\r\nAs my labors approached their completion, a gloomy feeling of dread\r\noppressed me. I feared that when the Vedas were finished my master would\r\nno longer require my services. But he relieved my fears by reëngaging\r\nme, and expressing a desire to retain me as his secretary until I became\r\ntoo famous and too proud to fill the office contentedly.\r\n\r\nScarcely was this cause of dread removed when another, more terrible\r\nstill, overtook me.\r\n\r\nOne evening he took me with him to a literary _reünion_, at which every\r\n_bel-esprit_ of the capital was to be present. At first I refused to go,\r\nfor I feared that the eyes of some of my own sex might penetrate my\r\ndisguise; but he seemed so much hurt at my refusal that I was forced to\r\nwithdraw it. The soirée was a very brilliant one. But little notice was\r\ntaken of the shy, awkward, silent youth, who glided from room to room,\r\nhovering ever near the spot where his beloved, master stood or sat, in\r\nconversation with the gifted of both sexes. How I envied the ladies\r\nwhose hands he touched, and to whom his polite attentions were\r\naddressed. For, as I have said, my master was a man of the world,\r\nwealthy and distinguished; and notwithstanding his advanced years,\r\nladies still courted his attentions.\r\n\r\nThere was one lady in particular, who spared no pains to attract him to\r\nherself. She was the widow of a celebrated _litterateur_ and was herself\r\nwell known as a brilliant but shallow writer. She was not young, but she\r\nwas well-preserved, and owed much to the arts of the toilet. I saw her\r\nlavishing her smiles and blandishments on my dear master; I saw that he\r\nwas not insensible to the power of her charms, artificial as they were;\r\nand a cruel jealousy fastened, like the vulture of Prometheus, on my\r\nvitals.\r\n\r\nCould I but have entered the lists with her on equal ground; could I but\r\nhave appeared before him in my own proper person, arrayed in appropriate\r\nand maidenly costume, I felt sure of gaining the victory, for I had\r\nyouth on my side; I had already an interest in his heart; but, alas! I\r\ncould not do this without first announcing myself as an impostor, as a\r\nliar and deceiver, to the man whose good opinion I prized above all\r\nearthly things.\r\n\r\nA dreadful thought now rested on my mind day and night: What if this\r\nwoman should accomplish her designs? What if my master should marry her?\r\nWhat would then become of me?\r\n\r\nBut I was spared this trial.\r\n\r\nThe translation was finished; it was in the hands of the publisher; and\r\nthe proof-sheets had been carefully revised, partly by my master, partly\r\nby myself. He had insisted on putting my name with his own on the\r\ntitle-page; but I refused my consent with a pertinacity which he could\r\nnot comprehend, and which came nearer making him angry than any thing\r\nthat had ever transpired between us.\r\n\r\nOne day, as I sat in the library, I saw my master come home, accompanied\r\nby two gentlemen. He did not, as was his custom with his intimates,\r\nbring them into the library, but received them in the little used\r\nreception-room. They remained some time.\r\n\r\nWhen they left, my master came into the library, rubbing his hands and\r\nlooking exceedingly well-pleased. But at sight of me, his countenance\r\nfell. He approached me, and in a tone of regret, said:\r\n\r\n'My poor Eugene! we must part.'\r\n\r\nPart? It seemed as if the sun was suddenly blotted from the heavens.\r\n\r\nI started up, and looked at him with a face so white and terror-stricken\r\nthat he came up to me and laid his hand kindly on my shoulder.\r\n\r\n'My poor Eugene!' he repeated, 'it is too true--we must part.'\r\n\r\nI tried to speak. 'Part!' I cried. 'O my master--'\r\n\r\nTears and sobs choked my utterance, in spite of all my efforts to\r\nrestrain them. I sat down again, and gave free vent to my irrepressible\r\ngrief.\r\n\r\nMy master was much affected by the sight of my emotion; and for some\r\nminutes the silence was unbroken, save by my heart-wrung sobs.\r\n\r\n'Nay, Eugene, this is womanish; bear it like a man,' said he, wiping the\r\ntears from his own eyes. 'Most gladly would I spare you this sorrow;\r\nmost gladly retain you near me; but in this matter I am powerless. I\r\nhave received an appointment from government, to travel in Northern\r\nAsia, in order to study the dialects of that vast region. Every\r\nindividual who is to accompany me has been officially specified, and\r\nthere is no place left for my poor Eugene.'\r\n\r\n'O my dear, dear master!' cried I, with clasped hands and streaming\r\neyes, 'take me with you--I shall die if you, leave me--put me in the\r\nplace of some one else.'\r\n\r\n'Impossible,' said he. 'The government has filled up every place with\r\nits own creatures--except,' he added, with a faint smile, 'that they\r\nhave left provision for my wife--if married. I would I had the wand of\r\nan enchanter, Eugene, that I might transform you to a woman, and make\r\nyou my wife.'\r\n\r\nHis wife! his wife! Had I heard the words aright? I sprang to my feet. I\r\ntried to say, 'I _am_ a woman--I will be your wife!' but my tongue\r\nrefused its utterance--there was a rushing sound in my ears--I grasped\r\nthe air wildly--I heard my master cry, 'Eugene! Eugene!' as he rushed\r\nforward to support me, and the next moment I lost consciousness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen I recovered my senses, I was still in the arms of my master. He had\r\nborne me to the window, and torn open my vest and shirt-collar. I\r\nlooked up in his face. One glance revealed to me that my secret was\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nBlushing and trembling, I tried to raise myself from his arms; but he\r\nheld me fast.\r\n\r\n'Eugene,' said he, in earnest tones, 'tell me the truth. Are you indeed\r\na woman?'\r\n\r\n'I am. My name is Eugenie D----, O my dear master! forgive the deception\r\nI have practiced. Do not despise me.'\r\n\r\n'Eugenie!' cried he, in joyful accents, 'you shall go with me to the\r\nEast! You shall go as _my wife! Vive I' Empereur_!\r\n\r\n'But wherefore this disguise?' he added.\r\n\r\nI told him my story in few words; and informed him that I was that very\r\n_young woman_ who had applied to him for the office I now held.\r\n\r\n'Is it possible?' exclaimed he. 'But, Eugenie, tell me--do you really\r\nlove me as you have so often protested you did?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, my dear master,' I whispered.\r\n\r\n'_Vive l'Empereur_!' cried he again; 'but for his strictness I should\r\nnever have found it out. Now go; array yourself in your woman's gear,\r\nand let me see you as you really are.'\r\n\r\nI went; and resumed, with a pleasure I can not describe, the garments I\r\nhad for a whole year forsworn.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned, my master caught me to his heart, and thanked Heaven\r\nfor the 'charming wife' so unexpectedly sent him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMACCARONI AND CANVAS.\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE CAMPAGNA.\r\n\r\nThere was an indefinable charm, to a lively man like Caper, in spending\r\na day in the open country around Rome. Whether it was passed, gun in\r\nhand, near the Solfatara, trying to shoot snipe and woodcock, or, with\r\npaint-box and stool, seated under a large white cotton umbrella,\r\nsketching in the valley of Poussin or out on the Via Appia, that day was\r\ninvariably marked down to be remembered.\r\n\r\nOn one of those golden February mornings, when the pretty English girls\r\ntramp through the long grass of the Villa Borghese, gathering the\r\nperfumed violets into those modest little bouquets, that peep out from\r\ntheir setting of green leaves, like faith struggling with jealousy,\r\nCaper, Rocjean, and a good-natured German, named Von Bluhmen, made an\r\nexcursion out in the Campagna.\r\n\r\nThey hired a one-horse vetturo in the piazza di Spagna, and packing in\r\ntheir sketching materials and a basket well filled with luncheon and\r\nbottles of red wine, started off, soon reaching the Saint Sebastian\r\ngate. Further on, they passed the tomb of Cecilia Metella, and saw\r\nstreaming over the Campagna the Roman hunt-hounds, twenty couples,\r\nmaking straight tails after a red fox, while a score of well-mounted\r\nhorsemen--here and there a red coat and white breeches--came riding\r\nfuriously after. Along the road-side were handsome open carriages,\r\nfilled with wit and beauty, talent and petticoats; and bright were the\r\nblue eyes, and red the healthy cheeks of the English girls, as they saw\r\nhow well their countrymen and lovers led off the chase. Englishmen\r\n_have_ good legs.\r\n\r\nContinuing along the Appian way, either side of which was bordered by\r\ntombs crumbling to decay; some of them covered with nature's lace, the\r\ngraceful ivy, others with only a pile of turf above them, others with\r\nshattered column and mutilated statue at their base--the occupants of\r\nthe vetturo were silent. They saw before them the wide plain, shut in on\r\nthe horizon by high mountains, with snow-covered peaks and sides, while\r\nthey were living in the warmth of an American June morning; the breeze\r\nthat swept over them was gentle and exhilarating; in the long grass\r\nwaving by the way-side, they heard the shrill cries of the cicadas;\r\nwhile the clouds, driven along the wide reach of heaven, assuming\r\nfantastic forms, and in changing light and shadow mantling the distant\r\nmountains, gave our trio a rare chance to study cloud-effects to great\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\n'I say, driver, what's your name?' asked Rocjean of the _vetturino_.\r\n\r\n'Cæsar, _padrone mio_,' answered the man.\r\n\r\n'Are you descended from the celebrated Julius?' asked Caper, laughing.\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir, my grandfather's name was Julius.'\r\n\r\n  ''That every like is not the same, O Cæsar!\r\n  The heart of Brutus yearns to think upon,''\r\n\r\nsoliloquized Caper; and as by this time they had reached a place where\r\nboth he and Rocjean thought a fine view of the ruined aqueduct might be\r\ntaken, they ordered the driver to stop, and taking out their sketching\r\nmaterials, sent him back to Rome, telling him to come out for them about\r\nfour o'clock, when they would be ready to return.\r\n\r\nWhile they were yet in the road, there came along a very large\r\ncountryman, mounted on a very small jackass; he was sitting side-saddle\r\nfashion, one leg crossed over the other, the lower leg nearly touching\r\nthe ground; one hand held a pipe to his mouth, while the other held an\r\nolive branch, by no means an emblem of peace to the jackass, who\r\ntwitched one long ear and then the other, in expectation of a momentary\r\nvisit from it on either side of his head. Following, at a dutiful\r\ndistance behind, came a splendid specimen of a Roman peasant-woman, a\r\ntrue _contadina_: poised on her head was a very large round basket, from\r\nover the edge of which sundry chickens' heads and cocks' feathers arose,\r\nand while Caper was looking at the basket, he saw two tiny little arms\r\nstuck up suddenly above the chickens, and then heard a faint squall--it\r\nwas her baby. An instantaneous desire seized Caper to make a rough\r\nsketch of the family group, and hailing the man, he asked him for a\r\nlight to his cigar. The jackass was stopped by pulling his left ear--the\r\nears answering for reins--and after giving a light, the man was going\r\non, when Caper, taking a _scudo_ from his pocket, told him that if he\r\nwould let him make a sketch of himself, wife, and jackass, he would give\r\nit to him, telling him also that he would not detain them over an hour.\r\n\r\n'If you'll give me a _buona mano_ besides the _scudo_, I'll do it,' he\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\nThe _buona mano_ is the ignis fatuus that leads on three fourths of the\r\nItalians; it is the bright spark that wakes them up to exertion. No\r\nmatter what the fixed price for doing any thing may be, there must\r\nalways be a something undefined ahead of it, to crown the work when\r\naccomplished. It makes labor a lottery; it makes even sawing wood a\r\nspecies of gambling. Caper promised a _buona mano_.\r\n\r\nThe man told his wife that the Signore was to make a _ritratto_, a\r\npicture of them all, including the jackass, at which she laughed\r\nheartily, showing a splendid set of brilliantly white teeth. A finer\r\ntype of woman it would be hard to find, for she was tall, straight, with\r\nmagnificent bust and broad hips. Her hair, thick and black, was drawn\r\nback from her forehead like a Chinese, and was confined behind her head\r\nwith two long silver pins, the heads representing flowers; heavy,\r\ncrescent-shaped, gold earrings hung from her ears; around her full\r\nthroat circled two strings of red coral beads. Her boddice of crimson\r\ncloth was met by the well-filled out-folds of her white linen shirt,\r\nthe sleeves of which fell from her shoulders below her elbows, in full,\r\ngraceful folds; her skirt was of heavy white woolen stuff, while her\r\nblue apron, of the same material, had three broad stripes of golden\r\nyellow, one near the top and the other two near each other at the\r\nbottom; the folds of the apron were few, and fell in heavy, regular\r\nlines. A full, liquid-brown pair of eyes gazed calmly on the painter, as\r\nshe stood beside her husband, easily, gracefully; without a sign from\r\nthe artist, taking a position that the most studied care could not have\r\nimproved.\r\n\r\n'_Benissimo_!' cried Caper, 'the position couldn't be better;' and\r\nseizing his sketch-book and pencils, unfolding his umbrella and planting\r\nits spiked end in the ground, and arranging his sketching-stool, he was\r\nin five minutes hard at work. As soon as he could draw the basket, he\r\ntold the woman she might take it from her head and put it on the ground,\r\nfor he believed the weight must incommode her. This done, she resumed\r\nher position, and Caper, working with all his might, had his sketch\r\nsufficiently finished before the hour was over to tell his group that it\r\nwas finished, at the same time handing the man a _scudo_ and a handsome\r\n_buona mano_.\r\n\r\nRocjean and Von Bluhmen, who had assiduously looked on, now and then\r\njoking with the _contadino_ and his wife, proposed, after the sketch was\r\nfinished, that Caper should ask his friends to help them finish their\r\nluncheon; this was joyously agreed to, and the party, having left the\r\nroad and found a pleasant spot, under a group of ilex-trees, were soon\r\nbusy finishing the eatables. It was refreshing to see how the handsome\r\n_contadina_ emptied glass after glass of red wine. The husband did his\r\nshare of drinking; but his wife eclipsed him. Having learned from Caper\r\nthat his first name was Giacomo, she shouted forth a rondinella, making\r\nup the words as she went along, and in it gave a ludicrous account of\r\nGiacomo, the artist, who took a jackass's portrait, herself and husband\r\nholding him, and the baby squalling in harmony. This met with an\r\nembarrassment of success, and amid the applause of Rocjean, Caper, and\r\nVon Bluhmen, the _contadino_, wife, and baggage departed. She, however,\r\ntold Caper where she lived in the Campagna, and that she had a beautiful\r\nlittle sister, whose _ritratta_ he should take, if he would come to see\r\nher.\r\n\r\n[It is needless to inform the reader that _he went_.]\r\n\r\nLighting cigars, Rocjean and Caper declared they must have a siesta,\r\neven if they had to doze on their stools, for neither of them ever could\r\naccustom himself to the Roman fashion of throwing one's self on the\r\nground, and sleeping with their faces to the earth. Von Bluhmen, a fiery\r\namateur of sketching, walked off to take a 'near view' of the aqueduct,\r\nand the two artists were left to repose.\r\n\r\n'I say, Caper, does it ever come into your head to people all this broad\r\nCampagna with old Romans?' asked Rocjean.\r\n\r\n'Yes, all the time. Do you know that when I am out here, and stumble\r\nover the door-way of an old Roman tomb, or find one of those thousand\r\ncaves in the tufa rock, I often have a curious feeling that from out\r\nthat tomb or cave will stalk forth in broad daylight some old Roman\r\ncenturion or senator, in flowing robe.'\r\n\r\n'Do you ever think,' asked Rocjean, 'of those seventy thousand poor\r\ndevils of Jews who helped build the Coliseum and the Arch of Titus? Do\r\nyou ever reflect over the millions of _slaves_ who worked for these same\r\npoetical, flowing-robed, old senators and centurions? _Ma foi_! for a\r\nRepublic, you men of the United States have a finished education for any\r\nthing but republicans. The great world-long struggle of a few to crush\r\nand destroy the many, you learn profoundly; you know in all its\r\nglittering cruelty and horror the entire history, and you weave from it\r\nno god-like moral. Nothing astonished me more, during my residence in\r\nthe United States, than this same lack of drawing from the experience of\r\nages the deduction that you were the only really blessed and happy\r\nnation in the world. Your educated men know less of the history of their\r\nown country, and feel less its sublime teachings, than any other race of\r\nmen in the world. The instruction your young men receive at school and\r\ncollege, in what way does it prepare them to become men fit for a\r\nrepublic?'\r\n\r\n'You are preaching a sermon,' said Caper.\r\n\r\n'I am reciting the text; the sermon will be preached by the god of\r\nbattles to the roar of cannons and the crack of rifles, and I hope\r\nyou'll profit by it after you hear it.'\r\n\r\n'Well,' interrupted Caper, 'what do you think of the English?'\r\n\r\n'For a practical people, they are the greatest fools on the earth.\r\nThoroughly convinced at heart that they have no _esprit_, they rush in\r\nto show the world that they have a superabundance of it.... It\r\ninterferes with their principles, no matter; it touches their pockets,\r\nbehold it is gone, and the cold, flat, dead reality stares you in the\r\nface.'\r\n\r\n'You are a Frenchman, Rocjean, and you do them injustice. Had Shakspeare\r\nno _esprit_?' asked Caper.\r\n\r\n'Shakspeare was a Frenchman,' replied Rocjean.\r\n\r\n'We--ll!'\r\n\r\n'Prove to me that he was not?'\r\n\r\n'Prove to me that he was!'\r\n\r\n'Certainly. The family of Jacques Pierre was as certainly French as\r\nRaimond de Rocjean's. Jacques Pierre became Shakspeare at once, on\r\nemigrating to England, and the 'Immortal Williams,' recognizing the\r\nadvantages to a poor man of living in a country where only the guineas\r\ndance, took up his abode there and made the music for the money to jump\r\ninto his pockets.'\r\n\r\n'Very ingenious. But in relation to Byron, Shelley, Keats, Tennyson,\r\nand--as we are in Italy--Rogers?'\r\n\r\n'_Mon ami_, if you seriously prefer ice-cream and trifle to venison and\r\n_dindon aux truffes_, choose. If either one of the four poets--I do not\r\ninclude Rogers among poets--ever conceived in his mind, and then\r\nproduced on paper, a work, composed from his memory, of things terrible\r\nin nature, more sublime than Dante's _Inferno_, I will grant you that he\r\nhad _esprit_ and imagination; otherwise, not. It is of the English as a\r\nnation, however, that I make my broad and sweeping assertion, one that\r\nwas fixed in my mind yesterday, when I saw a well-dressed and\r\nwell-_educated_ Englishman deliberately pick up a stone, knock off the\r\nhead of a figure carved on a sarcophagus, found in one of those\r\nnewly-discovered tombs on the Via Latina, and put the broken head in his\r\npocket.... What man, with one grain of _esprit_ or imagination in his\r\nhead, would mutilate a work of ancient art, solely that he might possess\r\na piece of stone, when memory had already placed the entire work forever\r\nin his mind. _Basta_! enough. Look at the effect of the sunlight on the\r\nAlbanian mountains. How proudly Mount Gennaro towers over the desolate\r\nCampagna! Hallo! Von Bluhmen down there is in trouble. Come along.'\r\n\r\nThrowing down his umbrella, under which he had been sitting in the\r\nshade, Rocjean grasped the iron-pointed shaft, into which the handle of\r\nthe umbrella fitted, and, accompanied by Caper, rushed to the rescue of\r\nthe German. It was none too soon. While sketching, a shepherd, with a\r\nvery large flock of sheep, had gradually approached nearer and nearer\r\nthe spot where the artist was sitting at his task; his dogs, eight or\r\nten in number, fierce, shaggy, white and black beasts, with slouching\r\ngait and pointed ears and noses, followed near him. As Von Bluhmen paid\r\nno attention to them, the shepherd had wandered off; but one or two of\r\nhis dogs hung back, and the artist, dropping a pencil, suddenly stooped\r\nto pick it up, when one of the savage creatures, thinking or\r\n'instincting' that a stone was coming at him, rushed in, with loud\r\nbarking, to make mince-meat of the German noble. He seized his\r\ncamp-stool, and kept the dog at bay; but in a moment the whole pack were\r\ndown on him. Just at this instant, in rushed Rocjean, staff in hand,\r\nbeating the beasts right and left, and shouting to the shepherd, who was\r\nbut a short distance off, to call off his dogs. But the _pecorajo_,\r\nevidently a cross-grained fellow, only blackguarded the artists, until\r\nRocjean, whose blood was up, swore if he did not call them off, he would\r\nshoot them, pulling a revolver from his pocket and aiming at the most\r\nsavage dog as he spoke. The shepherd only blackguarded him the more,\r\nand, just as the dog grabbed him by the pantaloons, Rocjean pulled the\r\ntrigger, and with foaming jaws and blood pouring from his mouth, the dog\r\nfell dead at his feet. The shot scared the other dogs, who fled, tails\r\nunder. The shepherd ran for the entrance of a cave, and came out in a\r\nminute with a single-barreled gun: coming down to within twenty feet of\r\nRocjean, he cocked it, and taking aim, screamed out: 'Give me ten\r\n_scudi_ for that dog, or I fire.'\r\n\r\n'Do you see that pistol?' said Rocjean to the shepherd, while he held up\r\nhis revolver, 'I have five loads in it yet.' And then advancing straight\r\ntoward him, with death in his eyes, he told him to throw down his gun,\r\nor he was a dead man.... Down fell the gun. Rocjean picked it up.\r\n'To-morrow,' said he, 'inquire of the chief of police in Rome for this\r\ngun and for the ten _scudi_!'\r\n\r\nThey were never called for.\r\n\r\n'You see,' said Caper, as, shortly after this little excitement, the\r\none-horse vetturo, bearing Cæsar and his fortunes, hove in sight, and\r\nthey entered and returned to Rome; 'you see how charming it is to sketch\r\non the Campagna.'\r\n\r\n'Very,' replied Von Bluhmen; 'but, my dear Rocjean, how long were you in\r\nAmerica?'\r\n\r\n'Twelve years.'\r\n\r\n'_Main Gott!_ they were not wasted.'\r\n\r\n\r\nBACCHUS IN ROME.\r\n\r\nIt is not at all astonishing that a god who was born to the tune of\r\nJove's thunderbolts, should have escaped scot-free from the thunders of\r\nthe Vatican, and should prove at the present time one of the strongest\r\nopponents to the latter kind of fire-works. We read, in the work of that\r\nlearned Jesuit, Galtruchius, that--\r\n\r\n    'Bacchus was usually painted with a mitre upon his head, an\r\n    ornament proper to Women. He never had other Priests but Satyrs\r\n    and Women; because the latter had followed him in great Companies\r\n    in his Journeys, crying, singing, and dancing continually. Titus\r\n    Livius relates a strange story of the Festivals of Bacchus in\r\n    Rome. Three times in a year, the Women of all qualities met in a\r\n    Grove called Simila, and there acted all sorts of Villainies;\r\n    those that appeared most reserved were sacrificed to Bacchus; and\r\n    that the cries of the ravished Creatures might not be heard, they\r\n    did howl, sing, and run up and down with lighted Torches.'\r\n\r\nThe May and October Festivals in Rome, at present, are substituted for\r\nthe Bacchanalian orgies, and are, of course, not so objectionable, in\r\nmany particulars, as the ancient ceremonies; still, no stranger in Rome,\r\nat these times, should neglect to attend them. Caper entered Rome at\r\nnight, during the October festival, and the carriage-loads of Roman\r\nwomen, waving torches and singing tipsily, forcibly reminded him that\r\nthe Bacchante still lived, and only needed a very little encouragement\r\nto revive their ancient rites in full.\r\n\r\nSentimental travelers tell you that the Romans are a temperate\r\npeople--they have never seen the people. They have never seen the\r\ndelight that reigns in the heart of the _plebs_, when they learn that\r\nthe vintage has been good, and that good wine will be sold in Rome for\r\nthree or four cents _la foglietta_, (about a pint, American measure.)\r\nThey have never visited the _spacii di vini_, the wine-shops; they have\r\nnever heard of the murders committed when the wine was in and the wit\r\nout. None of these things ever appear in the _Giornale di Roma_ or in\r\nthe _Vero Amico del_ _Popolo_, the only newspapers published in Rome.\r\n\r\n'Roman newspapers,' said an intelligent Roman to Caper, 'were invented\r\nto conceal the news.'\r\n\r\nThe first thing that a foreigner does on entering Rome is to originate a\r\nderogatory name for the juice of the grape native to the soil, the _vino\r\nnostrale_. He calls it, if red wine, red ink, pink cider, red tea; if\r\nwhite wine, balm of gooseberries, blood of turnips, apple-juice,\r\nalum-water, and slops for babes; finally ... if not killed off with a\r\nfever, from drinking the adulterated foreign wines, spirits, and\r\nliqueurs sold in the city, he takes kindly to the Roman wines, and does\r\nnot worry his great soul about them.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, that while other nations have done every thing to improve\r\nwine-making, Italy follows the same careless way she has done for\r\ncenturies. Far more attention was bestowed on the grape, too, in ancient\r\ntimes than now; and we read that vineyards were so much cultivated, to\r\nthe neglect of agriculture, that, under Domitian, an edict forbade the\r\nplanting of any new vineyards in Italy.\r\n\r\nOne brilliant morning, in October, Caper, who was then living in a town\r\nperched atop of a conical mountain, descended five or six miles on foot,\r\nand passed a day in a vineyard, in order to see the vintage. The vines\r\nwere trained on trees or on sticks of cane, and the peasant-girls and\r\nwomen were busy picking the great bunches of white or purple grapes,\r\nwhich were thrown into copper _conche_ or jars; these _conche_, when\r\nfilled, were carried on the head to a central spot where they were\r\nemptied on fern leaves, placed on the ground to receive them. And from\r\nthese piles, the wooden barrels of the mules returning from the town\r\nwere filled with the grapes which were carried up there to be pressed.\r\n\r\nThe grape-crop had been so affected by the _malattia_ or blight, that\r\nthe yield being small, the fruit to an extent was not pressed in the\r\nvineyards, and the juice only brought up to the town in goat-skins as\r\nusual; but the fruit itself was carried up, by those having the proper\r\nplaces, and was pressed in tubs in the _cantine_ or rooms on the\r\nground-floor, where the wine is kept. Across the huge saddles of the\r\nmules, they swung a couple of truncated cone-shaped barrels, and filled\r\nthem with grapes; these were tumbled into tubs, ranged in the _cantina_,\r\ngood, bad and indifferent fruit all together; and when enough were\r\npoured in, in jumped the _pistatore d'uve_ or grape-presser, with bare\r\nlegs and feet, and began pressing and stamping, until the juice ran out\r\nin a tolerable stream. This juice was then poured into a headless\r\nhogshead, and when more than half-full, they piled on the grapeskins and\r\nstones and stems that had undergone the pressure, until the hogshead was\r\nfull to the top. A weight was then placed over all. In twenty days,\r\nfermentation having taken place, they drew from the hogshead the new\r\nwine, which was afterward clarified with whites of eggs.\r\n\r\nIn this rough-and-ready way, the common wine is made. Without selection,\r\nall grapes, ripe, unripe, and rotten, sweet and sour, are mashed up\r\ntogether, hurriedly and imperfectly pressed, and the wine is sent to\r\nmarket, to sell for what it will bring. Having thus seen it made, let us\r\nsee it disposed of.\r\n\r\nOf all the monuments to Bacchus, in Rome, the one near the pyramid of\r\nCaius Cestius, and still nearer the Protestant burying-ground, is by far\r\nthe most noticeable. Jealous of the lofty manner in which it lifts its\r\nhead above the surrounding fields and walls of the city, the church has\r\nseen fit to crown its head with a cross, which it seems inclined to\r\nshake off. This small mountain of a monument is conical in shape, and is\r\ncomposed entirely of broken crockery; hence its name, _Testaccio_. In\r\nits crockery sides, they have found a certain coolness and evenness of\r\ntemperature exactly suited to the storage of wine, and to maturing it;\r\nhence, all around the mountain are deep vaults, filled with red and\r\nwhite wines, working themselves up for a fit state to enter into the joy\r\nand the gullets of the Roman _minenti_.\r\n\r\nIf the reader of this sketch is at all of a philosophical frame of mind,\r\nand should ever visit Rome, it is the writer's advice that, in the first\r\nplace, having learned Italian enough, and in the second place, having\r\nhis purse fairly filled--silver will do--he should, during the month of\r\nOctober, on a holyday, go out to Monte Testaccio alone, or at least in\r\ncompany with some one who knows enough to let him he alone when he wants\r\nto be with somebody else, and then and there fraternizing for a few\r\nhours with the Roman _plebs_, let him at his ease see what he shall see.\r\nThen shall he sit him down at the door of the _Antica Osteria di\r\nCappanone_, at the rough wood table, on a rougher wooden bench; talk\r\nright and left, with tailors, shoemakers, artists, soldiers, and God\r\nknows what, drinking the cool, amber-colored wine of Monte Rotonda,\r\ngleaming brightly in the sunlight that dashes through his glass, and so\r\ncheerfully winning the good-will of them all--and of some of the young\r\nwomen who are with them--that he shall find himself at some future time\r\neither the sheath for a Roman knife, or the recipient of a great deal of\r\naffection, and the purchaser of indefinite _bottiglie_ of _vino\r\nnostrale_.\r\n\r\nIn his ardent pursuit of natural art, Caper believed it his duty to hunt\r\nup the picturesque wherever it could be found, and it was while pursuing\r\nthis duty, in company with Rocjean, that he found himself at Monte\r\nTestaccio, one October day, and there made his _débût_. After a luncheon\r\nof raw ham, bread, cheese, sausage, and a _bottiglia_ of wine, they\r\nascended the mountain, and sitting down at the foot of the cross, they\r\nquietly smoked and communed with nature unreservedly.\r\n\r\nCrumbling old walls of Rome that lay below them; wild, uncultivated\r\nCampagna; purple range of mountains, snow-tipped; thousand-legged,\r\nruined aqueducts; distant sea, but faintly revealed through the vail of\r\nhaze-bounded horizon; yellow Tiber, flowing along crumbling banks; dome\r\nof St. Peter's, rising above the hill that shuts the Vatican from sight;\r\npyramid of Caius Cestius; Protestant burying-ground, with the wind\r\nsighing through the trees a lullaby over the graves of Shelley and\r\nKeats; distant view of Rome, slumbering artistically, and not\r\nmanufacturingly, in the sunlight of that morning--ye taught one man of\r\nthe two wild hopes for Rome of the future.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the mountain, and adjoining the Protestant\r\nburying-ground, there is a powder-magazine. Here a French soldier,\r\nacting as sentry, paced his weary round. It was not long before a couple\r\nof Roman women passed him. They saluted him; he saluted them. They\r\npassed behind the magazine. The sentry, with the courtesy which\r\ndistinguishes Frenchmen, evidently desired to make his compliments and\r\npay his addresses to the _dames_. How could this be done? Before long,\r\ntwo of his compatriots, evidently out for a holiday, passed him. He\r\nbeckoned to one of them, who at once took his gun and turned sentry,\r\nwhile the relieved guard flew to display to the _dames_ his national\r\ncourtesy. Before Caper had time to smoke a second cigar, the soldier\r\nreturned to duty, and the one who had relieved him sprung to pay his\r\naddresses. During the two hours that Caper and Rocjean studied the\r\nscenery, guard was relieved four times.\r\n\r\n'Ah!' said Rocjean, 'we are a gallant nation. Let us therefore descend\r\nand mingle with what the high-minded John Bulls call 'the lower\r\norders.''\r\n\r\nDown they went, and at the first table they came to, they found their\r\nshoemaker, the Signore Eugenio Calzolajo, artist in leather, seated with\r\nthree Roman women. They all resembled each other like three pins. The\r\neldest one held a baby, the _caro bambino_, in her arms; she was\r\nprobably twenty years old. The next one was not over eighteen; while\r\nthe youngest had evidently not passed her sixteenth year.\r\n\r\nThe artist in leather saluted Caper and Rocjean with the title of\r\n_Illustrissimi_, (they both paid their bills punctually,) and, as he saw\r\nthat the other tables were full, he at once made room for them,\r\nintroducing them to his wife and her two sisters. Caper, who saw that\r\nthe party had just arrived, and had not as yet had time to order any\r\nthing from the waiters, told them that the day being his birthday, it\r\nwas customary among the North-American Indians always to celebrate it\r\nwith a feast of roast dogs and bottled porter; but, as neither of these\r\narticles were to be found at Monte Testaccio, he should command what\r\nthey had; and arresting a waiter, he ordered such a supply of food and\r\nwine, that the eyes of the three Roman girls opened wide as owls'. Their\r\ntongues were all unloosened at once, as if by magic, and Caper had the\r\nsatisfaction of seeing that for what a bottle of Hotel Champaigne costs\r\nin the United States, he had provided joy unadulterated, and happy\r\nmemories for many days, for several descendants of the Caesars.\r\n\r\nWhile the wine circulated freely, the eldest, of the unmarried girls,\r\nnamed Eliza, began joking Caper about his being a heretic and 'a little\r\ndevil,' and asked him to take off his hat, to see if he had horns. Caper\r\ntold her he was as yet unmarried, ... and that among the Indians,\r\nbachelors were never allowed to take their hats off before maidens.\r\n'But,' said he, 'what makes you think I am a heretic? Wasn't I at Saint\r\nPeter's yesterday, and at the confessionals?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, you were at them like an old German gentleman I once knew,' said\r\nEliza. 'Some of his friends saw him one morning at the German\r\nconfessional-box, and knowing that he was a heretic, asked him what he\r\nwas doing there? '_Diavolo!_' said he, 'can't a man have a comfortable\r\nmouthful of German, without changing religions?''\r\n\r\n'For my part,' said Rita, the youngest sister, 'I only go to\r\nconfessional, because I _have_ to, and I only confess what I want to.'\r\n\r\n'Bravo!' exclaimed Rocjean, 'I must _paint your portrait_.'\r\n\r\n'_Benissimo!_ and who will paint mine?' asked Eliza.\r\n\r\n'I will,' said Caper, 'but on condition that you let me keep a copy of\r\nit.'....\r\n\r\nArrangements completed, Rocjean ordered more wine; and then the artist\r\nin leather ordered more; then Caper's turn came. After this, the\r\nparty--which had been gradually growing jolly and jollier, would have\r\ndanced, had they not all had a holy horror of the prison of San Angelo.\r\nThe married sister, Dominica, was a full-blooded _Trasteverina_, in her\r\ngala dress, and had one of those beautiful-shaped heads that Caper could\r\nonly compare to a quail's; her jet-black hair, smoothed close to her\r\nhead, was gathered in a large roll that fell low on her neck behind, and\r\nheld by a silver _spadina_ or pin, that, if occasion demanded, would\r\nmake a serviceable stiletto; her full face was brown, while the red\r\nblood shone through her cheeks, and her lips were full and ripe. Her\r\neyes of deep gray, shaded with long black lashes, sparkled with light\r\nwhen she was aroused. Her sisters resembled her strikingly, except Rita,\r\nthe youngest, whose face was of that singularly delicate hue of white,\r\nthe color of the magnolia-flower, as one of our American writers has it;\r\nor like the white of a boiled egg next to the yolk, as Caper expressed\r\nit. Be this as it may, there was something very attractive in this\r\npallor, since it was accompanied by an _embonpoint_ indicating any thing\r\nbut romantic meagerness of constitution.\r\n\r\nDominica had, without exaggeration, the value of a dozen or two pairs of\r\npatent-leather boots hung on her neck, arms, fingers, ears, and bosom,\r\nin the shape of furious-sized pieces of gold jewelry; and it was solid\r\ngold. The Roman women, from the earliest days--from the time when\r\nEtruscan artists made those ponderous chains and bracelets down to this\r\npresent date--have had the most unbridled love for jewelry. Do we not\r\nknow[D] that--\r\n\r\n  Sabina's garters were worth,... $200,000\r\n  Faustina's finger-ring,... 200,000\r\n  Domitia'a ring,... 300,000\r\n  Cæesonia's bracelet,... 400,000\r\n  Poppæa's earrings,... 600,000\r\n  Calpurina's (Cæsar's wife) earrings,\r\n    'above suspicion,'... 1,200,000\r\n  Sabina's diadem,... 1,200,000\r\n\r\nAnd after this, is it at all astonishing that the desire remains for it,\r\neven if the substance has been plundered and carried off by those\r\n_forestieri_, the Huns, Vandals, Goths, Visigoths, Norsemen, and other\r\nheretics who have visited Rome?\r\n\r\nWhile they were all busily drinking and talking, Caper had noticed that\r\nthe wine was beginning to have its effects on the large crowd who had\r\nassembled at the Osterias and Trattorias around the foot of the Bacchic\r\nmountain. Laughing and talking, shouting and singing, began to be in the\r\nascendant, and gravity was voted indecent.\r\n\r\n'Ha!' said Rocjean, 'for one hour of the good old classic days!'\r\n\r\n'What!' answered Caper, 'with those seventy thousand old Jews you were\r\npreaching about the other day?'\r\n\r\n'Never!--with the Bacchante. But here our friends are off: let us help\r\nthem into the carriage.'\r\n\r\nAs the sun went down, the _minenti_ began to crowd toward Rome. More\r\nthan one _spadina_ flashed in the hands of the slightly-tight maidens\r\nwho were on foot. Those of the men who had carriages, foreseeing the\r\ninflammable spirit aroused, packed the women in by themselves, gave them\r\nlighted torches, and cut them adrift, to float down the Corso; they\r\nfollowing in separate carriages.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n'Ah! really, and pray, Mrs. Jobson, don't you think that it's--ah! a\r\nbeautiful sight; they tell me--ah! it's the peasants returning from\r\nvisiting the shrine of the--ah! Madonna--ah?'\r\n\r\n'And I think it is _most_ charming, Mister Lushington; and I remember me\r\nnow that Lady Fanny Errol, poor thing, said it would be a _charming_\r\nsight. And the poor creatures seem _much_ happier than our own lower\r\norders; they do, to be sure.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n'O Lord!' groaned Caper, as he overheard the above dialogue, 'allow me\r\nto retire.'\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPER 'STARTS' A MENAGERIE.\r\n\r\nAs an animal-painter, Mr. Caper was continually hunting up materials for\r\nsketches. He made excursions into the Campagna, to see the long-horned\r\ngray oxen and the hideous buffaloes; watching the latter along the\r\nyellow Tiber, when, in the spring-time, they coquetted in the mud and\r\nwater. He sketched goats and sheep, tended by the picturesquely-dressed\r\nshepherds and guarded by the fierce dogs that continually encircled\r\nthem. In four words, he studied animal-ated nature.\r\n\r\nOn his first arrival in Rome, he had purchased one of those sprightly\r\nlittle _vetturo_ dogs, all wool and tail, that the traveler remarks\r\nmounted on top of the traveling carriages that enter and leave Rome.\r\nWith a firm foothold, they stand on the very top of all the baggage that\r\nmay be piled on the roof of the coach; and there, standing guard and\r\nbarking fiercely, seem to thoroughly enjoy the confusion attendant on\r\nstarting the horses or unloading the baggage. They are seen around the\r\ncarriage-stands where public hacks are hired, and as soon as one moves\r\noff, up jumps the _vetturo_ dog alongside the driver, and never leaves\r\nthe vehicle until it stops; then, if he sees another hack returning to\r\nthe city, he will jump into that, and be carried back triumphant. This\r\nsounds like fiction; but its truth will be confirmed by any one who has\r\never noticed the peculiarities of this breed of dogs, which love to\r\nride.\r\n\r\nCaper kept this dog in his studio, and had already made several very\r\nlife-like studies of him. One morning, leaving his lodgings earlier than\r\nusual, he met on the stairway of his house a countryman driving a goat\r\nup-stairs to be milked; the Romans thus having good evidence that when\r\nthey buy goat's milk, they don't purchase water from the fountains. As\r\nCaper was going out of the door that led into the street, he saw among\r\nthe flock of goats assembled there, a patriarchal old Billy, whose beard\r\nstruck him with delight. He was looking at him in silent veneration,\r\nwhen the goats'-milk man came down-stairs, driving the ewe before him.\r\nHe asked the man if he would sell the patriarch; but found that he would\r\nnot. He promised, however, to lend him to Caper until the next day, for\r\na good round sum, to be paid when the goat was delivered at the studio,\r\nwhich the man said would be in the course of an hour.\r\n\r\nOur artist then went down to the Greco, where he breakfasted; and there\r\nmet Rocjean, who proposed to him to go that morning to the Piazza\r\nNavona, as it was market-day, and they would have a fine chance to take\r\nnotes of the country-people, their costumes, etc. They first went around\r\nto Caper's studio, where they had only to wait a short time before the\r\nmilk-man came, driving the old Billy-goat up-stairs before him. Caper\r\nmade him fast with a cord to a heavy table, the top of which was a vast\r\nreceptacle of sketch-books, oil-colors, books, and all kinds of odds and\r\nends.\r\n\r\nRocjean and he then strolled down to the Piazza Navona, where, while\r\nwalking around, Caper suddenly stumbled over the smallest and most\r\ncomical specimen of a donkey he had ever seen. The man who owned him,\r\nand who had brought in a load of vegetables on the donkey's back,\r\noffered to sell him very cheap. The temptation was great, and our animal\r\nartist bought him at once for five _scudi_, alias dollars; but with the\r\nunderstanding that the countryman would deliver him at his studio at\r\nonce. In twenty minutes' time, the donkey was climbing up a long flight\r\nof stairs to Caper's studio, as seriously as if he were crossing the\r\n_pons asinorum_. Once in his studio, Caper soon made arrangements to\r\nhave the donkey kept in a stable near by, when he was not sketching him.\r\nThis matter finished, Rocjean helped Caper pen him up in a corner of the\r\nstudio, where he could begin sketching him as soon as he had finished\r\nportraying the billy-goat. The patriarch had made several attempts to\r\nrush at the vetturo-dog; but the string held him fast to the table.\r\nRocjean mentioned to Caper that he ought to feed his menagerie, and the\r\nporter being called and sent out for some food for the goat and donkey,\r\nsoon returned with a full supply.\r\n\r\nBoth artists now set to work in earnest; Caper with paints and brushes,\r\nand Rocjean with crayons and sketch-book, determined to take the\r\npatriarch's portrait while he was in a peaceful frame of body and\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\nWith an intermission for luncheon, they worked until nearly four o'clock\r\nin the afternoon, when Rocjean proposed taking a walk out to the Villa\r\nBorghese, and as they returned, on their way to dinner, they could stop\r\nin at the studio, and see that the donkey and goat were driven out to\r\nthe stable, where they could be kept until wanted again. Accordingly,\r\nboth artists walked out to the villa, and had only taken a short turn\r\ntoward the Casino, when they met a New-York friend of theirs, alone in a\r\ncarriage, taking a ride. He ordered the driver to stop, and begged them\r\nboth to get in with him, and after passing through the villa and around\r\nthe Pincio, to come and take dinner with him sociably in his rooms in\r\nthe Via Frattina. They accepted; and at ten o'clock that night, while\r\ngoing home in a very happy frame of mind, it suddenly occurred to Caper\r\nthat his menagerie ought to have been attended to. Rocjean consoled him\r\nwith the reflection that, having the key in his pocket, they could not\r\npossibly get out; so the former thought no more about it.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning, having met as usual at the Greco, and breakfasted\r\ntogether, Caper and Rocjean walked round to the former's studio. Before\r\nthey entered the door of the building, they noticed a small assembly of\r\nold women surrounding the porter, and as Caper entered the passage-way,\r\nthey poured a broadside into him.\r\n\r\n'_Accidente, Signore_, nobody around here has been able to sleep a wink\r\nall night long. _Santa Maria!_ such yells have come from your studio,\r\nsuch groans, such horrible noises, as if all the devils had broken\r\nloose. We are going to the police; we are going to the _gendarmeria_; we\r\nare going to--'\r\n\r\n'Go there--and be hanged!' shouted Caper, breaking through the crowd,\r\nand running up-stairs two steps at a time, he nearly walked into the lap\r\nof a tall female model, named Giacinta, dressed in Ciociara costume, who\r\nwas calmly seated on the stair-case, glaring at another female model,\r\nnamed Nina, who stood leaning against the door of his studio.\r\n\r\n'Signor Giacomo, good morning!' said Giacinta, 'didn't you tell _me_ to\r\nbe here at nine o'clock?'\r\n\r\n'To be sure I did,' replied he.\r\n\r\n'Then,' continued she, 'what is _that person_ there taking the bread out\r\nof my mouth for? _Cospetto!_'\r\n\r\n'_Iddio giusto!_' cried Nina, 'hear her; she calls _me_, ME, a person! I\r\nwho have a watch and chain, and wear a hooped petticoat! _I_ take the\r\nbread out of her mouth. I a person! I'm a lady, _per Bacco!_'\r\n\r\n'Tace!' said Rocjean to Nina, 'or the Signore Giacomo will send you\r\nflying. What do you want, Nina?'\r\n\r\n'I only wanted to see if the Signore intended to paint the Lady Godeeva,\r\nthat he told me about the other day.'\r\n\r\n'Wait till I open the studio-door, and get out of this noise. Those old\r\nwomen down below, and you young ones up here, are howling like a lot of\r\nhyenas. Here, come in!' ... As Caper said this, he unlocked the\r\nstudio-door and threw it open; the two models were close at his elbows,\r\nwhile Rocjean drew to one side to let them pass in.\r\n\r\nIn the next minute, Caper, the two models, a he-goat, a dirty little\r\ndonkey, and a yelping dog, were rolling head over heels down-stairs, one\r\nconfused mass of petticoats and animals.\r\n\r\nRocjean roared with laughter; he could do nothing but hold his sides,\r\nfearful of having an apopletic fit or bursting a blood-vessel.\r\n\r\nThe small donkey slid down-stairs on his back, slowly, gradually,\r\nmeekly; his long ears rubbing the way before him. But the billy-goat was\r\non his feet in an instant, and was charging, next thing, full force into\r\nthe knot of old women at the foot of the stairs, who, believing that\r\ntheir last hour had come, and that it was old Nick in person, yelled\r\nout,' 'Tis he; the devil! the devil!' and fled before the horns to come.\r\n\r\nGiacinta was the first one on her legs, and after picking up the _caro_\r\nGiacomo, _alias_ Caper, and finding he was not hurt, she then\r\ngood-naturedly helped Nina to arrange her tumbled garments.\r\n\r\nRocjean rushed to open the studio-windows, to air the room, for it had\r\nnot the odors of the Spice Islands in it. Caper hastened to pick up\r\npaints, brushes, books, easel; but they were too many for him, and at\r\nlast, giving it up in despair, he sat down on a chair.\r\n\r\n'_Well!_' said he, 'there _has_ been a HARD fight here! The dog must\r\nhave tackled the billy-goat; the goat must have upset this table, broken\r\nhis string, and pitched into that dirty little donkey; and the donkey\r\nmust have put his heels through that canvas; and all three must have\r\nbroken loose and upset us ... I say, Rocjean, send out for some wine;\r\n_I_ am dry, and these girls are, I know.'\r\n\r\nPeace was soon made. Nina was promised that she should sit for Lady\r\nGodiva, as soon as the donkey was caught; for she was to be represented\r\nseated on him instead of a horse. Giacinta poséd for a _contadina_ at a\r\nfountain. Rocjean passed round the wine, and helped put the studio in\r\norder; and Caper, brush in hand, painted away, determining that under\r\nany circumstances, he never would open another menagerie, until he was\r\nable to pay a keeper to look after the animals.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFAIRIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Our fathers, when the race was young,\r\n    And therefore some say better,\r\n  With fresh simplicity, believed\r\n    In Dryad, Faun, and Satyr.\r\n  The Zephyrs breathéd throughout the air,\r\n    And when the scene was fitting,\r\n  The Naiads combed their golden hair,\r\n    Beside the waters sitting.\r\n\r\n  And we ourselves in childhood loved\r\n    A faith so sweet as this is;\r\n  We felt the touch of rose-leaf palms,\r\n    And almost felt their kisses:\r\n  We tracked them through the shadowy grass,\r\n    Or when the evening glistened,\r\n  We lay in wait to see them pass,\r\n    And to their singing listened.\r\n\r\n  The hawthorn stretches wide its arms,\r\n    And all the woods are fragrant,\r\n  But Fancy walks in high-heeled shoes,\r\n    And is no more a vagrant.\r\n  No Satyrs from the greenwood peer,\r\n    No more we see at gloaming,\r\n  The Naiads sit, their golden hair\r\n    Beside the waters combing.\r\n\r\n  Alas! our early faith is cold,\r\n    And all things are so real!\r\n  Now, grown too wise, we shut our eyes,\r\n    And laugh at the ideal.\r\n  The charméd dusk still settles down\r\n    Upon the happy prairies;\r\n  But twilight's chiefest charm is flown,\r\n    For where are now the fairies?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOHN BRIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe late misunderstanding between this country and Great Britain,\r\nrelative to Mason and Slidell, elicited a free expression of opinion\r\nfrom the statesmen of the mother country, as to the contest now\r\nproceeding in this country; and while we regretted to witness so many\r\nproofs of the prejudice and jealousy which seem to hold possession of\r\nthe minds of our transatlantic cousins, we were gratified by the heroic\r\nand brilliant defense of our cause by one so eminent in intellectual and\r\nmoral qualities as JOHN BRIGHT. The boldness and vigor of his efforts to\r\ndispel the hostility of his compatriots toward America, and the masterly\r\nability with which he disarmed the weapons of our opponents, elicited\r\nthe respect of our people and have made his name one of veneration among\r\nthem. His position in our favor, amid the many discouragements which\r\nbeset him, justifies an attempt to lay before our readers an account of\r\nhis career and character, which, we doubt not, they will be interested\r\nto hear.\r\n\r\nJohn Bright, Member of Parliament for the great city of Birmingham, is\r\nthe son of respectable Quaker parents, and was born at Greenbank, near\r\nRochdale, in the year 1811. His family being largely interested in the\r\ncotton manufacture, he was bred to a participation in this employment,\r\nand is now the senior member of an extensive and enterprising firm, in\r\ncompany with his brothers. It is hardly to be expected that one whose\r\nearly youth had been devoted to the restricted sphere of a\r\ncounting-room, would be remarkable for an extensive knowledge of men and\r\nevents, liberal opinions, freshness of intellect, and vigorous\r\nbrilliancy of declamation; and yet Mr. Bright has always manifested\r\nsuperiority in these qualities. Known, while occupied exclusively in the\r\ndetails of his proper avocation, for skill, promptness, and enterprise,\r\nhe has also been distinguished, since his sphere of usefulness has been\r\nextended to the national councils, for the scope and accuracy of his\r\ngeneral information, the comprehensiveness of his mind, the richness of\r\nhis imagination, and the effective energy of his eloquence. He early\r\nmanifested an interest in politics, which was intensified by the\r\nagitation of questions nearly affecting his own business interests. The\r\ncelebrated Anti-Corn-Law League, which was instituted in the time of\r\nLord Melbourne's ministry, by some eminent Whigs, for the purpose of\r\nopposing the tariff erected by the corn-laws, excited his enthusiastic\r\ncoöperation, and afforded him an early opportunity of entering political\r\nlife. The enlightened ideas of the Reformers had already effected a\r\nglorious renovation in the machinery of the government; and the\r\nregeneration of the commercial system was next to be accomplished, by a\r\nsuccessful resistance to the selfish restrictions imposed upon trade by\r\nthe landed proprietors. In such a cause, John Bright embarked in his\r\ntwenty-seventh year; and his subsequent career has been a consistent\r\nadherence to the same views which marked his entrance into public\r\nnotice. He espoused with ardor the principles avowed by the League, and\r\nleaving the management of his private interests in the hands of the\r\njunior members of the firm, began to discuss them publicly, with great\r\nforce and effect. The League soon perceived the valuable acquisition\r\nthey had made in the young Quaker, and not only encouraged him to\r\nexertion but gave him opportunities to appear before many important\r\nassemblages. On the list of orators whom the League commissioned to go\r\ninto the agricultural districts to advocate their cause, Mr. Bright's\r\nname soon became prominent. By the irresistible cogency and energetic\r\nexpression which characterized his speech before many thousands in Drury\r\nLane Theatre, his reputation became national, and printed copies being\r\ndistributed throughout England, a desire to hear him on the important\r\nquestion of the day became every where manifest. He went about among the\r\nfarmers and gentry, instilling with ability the principles of free\r\ntrade, developing arguments with telling effect, and rapidly organizing\r\nbranches of the League throughout the kingdom. The distrust of the lower\r\nclasses, which was awakened in some degree against the nobles and nabobs\r\nwho sustained the League, did not operate against him, who, as a man\r\ndirectly from the people, educated in the stern school of labor, and as\r\nthe daily witness of and sympathizer with the suffering of the poor, at\r\nonce elicited their confidence in his honesty and their respect for his\r\nintellectual power. Political advantage, which might be sought by\r\nlife-long politicians and hereditary nobles, could, they well knew,\r\noffer no inducement to nor corrupt the ingenuous principles of one who\r\nshowed so little respect to party distinction, and who was entirely\r\nindependent of great connections.\r\n\r\nThe statesmen with whom he acted, in favor of free trade, were unwilling\r\nto be without so valuable an ally on the floor of the House of Commons;\r\nand, in April, 1843, he was placed in nomination by his numerous friends\r\nat Durham, for the seat to which that city was entitled.\r\n\r\nOn the first trial, he was defeated; but a new election for the same\r\ncity becoming necessary in the following July, he was returned, by a\r\ngratifying majority, to represent a place noted for its conservative\r\nproclivities. He continued the member for Durham until 1847.\r\n\r\nHis first efforts, after entering Parliament, were directed to the\r\nrepeal of the Corn-Laws, in which beneficent measure he coöperated with\r\nsuch men as Charles P. Villiers, brother of Lord Clarendon, Lord\r\nMorpeth, now Earl of Carlisle, Lord John Russell, and his friend, Mr.\r\nRichard Cobden. Sir Robert Peel, who was at that time Prime Minister,\r\nhad always adhered to the protective doctrines of Pitt and Wellington;\r\nand it was mainly due to the clear and cogent reasoning of Bright and\r\nhis associates, that the illustrious statesman at the head of the\r\nTreasury finally yielded, with a magnanimity never surpassed in the\r\nannals of ministerial history, to the enlightened policy of free trade\r\nin respect to corn. The distress which had for years resulted from the\r\nstringent enactments of Lord Liverpool's government to the lower class,\r\nwas, by this patriotic sacrifice of the first minister, done away with;\r\nand not least among those who contributed to the accomplishment of so\r\nauspicious a result, we must reckon the subject of this sketch. The Tory\r\nparty, headed by such chiefs as Wellington and Lyndhurst, in the Lords,\r\nand Stanley and Disraeli, in the Commons, made a stern and pertinacious\r\nresistance to the repeal; and no one was more feared by the intellectual\r\ngiants of that party than was Bright. His severe wit, his plain, blunt\r\nmanner of exposing the defects of his opponents, and his impulsive and\r\noverwhelming declamation, were hardly exceeded by the fluent exuberance\r\nof Stanley and the keen sarcasm of the Hebrew novelist, Disraeli.\r\n\r\nWhile he generally acted with the party of which Lord Russell and Lord\r\nLandsdowne were the chiefs, he did not place himself supinely under the\r\ndictation of the caucus-room. Professing to be bound by the precepts of\r\nno faction, acting frequently with the conservatives, although oftener\r\nwith the liberals, independent of ministerial control, and disdaining to\r\nattain power by the sacrifice of any principle, he was excluded from a\r\nparticipation in the government, when those with whom he in general\r\nsympathized succeeded to the administration in 1846. He early adopted\r\nultra-liberal views, and has always been known as the advocate of\r\nuniversal suffrage, the separation of Church and State, and the\r\ndiminution of the influence of hereditary nobles; and although he could\r\nnot but be aware that many of his doctrines were repugnant to those of\r\nhis auditors, and a majority of his countrymen, he has not hesitated to\r\nuphold and express them with great perseverance and ingenuousness.\r\n\r\nHad he lived in the days of Russell and Sidney, he had perhaps shared\r\ntheir fate, and paid the penalty of unpopular politics on the scaffold.\r\nThat bold spirit which he has ever manifested, exciting his great\r\ntalents in the advocacy of repugnant theories, would not have feared the\r\nrestraints which a ruder age encouraged despotic kings to put upon\r\nfreedom of political action. Luckily, he has been living in an age which\r\nrespects independent thought and proscribes the conscience of no man.\r\nWhile he is certainly premature in his theories of equality, the\r\ntendency of popular feeling is toward him rather than from him. Tory\r\npolicy to-day was Whig policy a century ago. Walpole would have\r\nsustained the younger Pitt, and Derby and Lyndhurst will hardly dispute\r\nthe benefits of the reform of 1832.\r\n\r\nMr. Bright was returned to Parliament for Manchester, in 1847, and again\r\nin 1852. This great town, which is the market for Rochdale, and\r\nconsequently in which he was well known, sent him to the Commons by a\r\nhandsome majority of eleven hundred. In the early session of 1857, Mr.\r\nCobden introduced a motion condemning the war into which the\r\nadministration had entered with China, on which the government was\r\ndefeated. Mr. Bright, though absent on account of ill-health, used his\r\ninfluence in favor of the motion, by reason of which, on the appeal of\r\nLord Palmerston to the country, during the summer of that year, he was\r\ndefeated in his constituency by over five thousand votes; his successful\r\nopponent, though agreeing with him in general, being a supporter of the\r\nChinese war.\r\n\r\nIn 1859, he was reinstated in Parliament, by the electors of Birmingham,\r\nof whose manufacturing interests he had always shown himself a\r\nconsistent and ardent friend. For this constituency he is now member. He\r\nhas been twice married; first, to the daughter of Jonathan Priestley,\r\nEsq., of Newcastle-on-Tyne, who died in 1841; and secondly, to his\r\npresent wife, the eldest daughter of W. Leatham, Esq., of Wakefield,\r\nYork.\r\n\r\nHis career of nineteen years in the House of Commons has been a series\r\nof successful efforts, not only contributing to his lasting fame as an\r\norator and legislator, but achieving many important modifications in the\r\ncommercial system and in public sentiment. He has been the life of the\r\nradical party, leading them on in their crusades against existing abuses\r\nwith fearless audacity, encouraging them to renewed contests, animating\r\nthem by the hopefulness and enthusiasm of his own soul, and by his lucid\r\nlogic attracting new converts to his views with every year. The Radicals\r\nwho, when he entered Parliament, were a mere handful, are already\r\nassuming, under the vigorous lead of Bright, Cobden, and Villiers, the\r\nproportions of a systematic and powerful element in the lower house.\r\nCaring little for the impotent sneers of an aristocracy in its dotage,\r\nand mindful only to advance systems of popular improvement and\r\nalleviation, he has become a nucleus around which has gathered the\r\nextreme wing of the liberal party. The last century beheld the\r\nprofligate Wilkes and the shallow Burdett at the head of the ultraists;\r\nour own time is more fortunate in superseding vicious and unprincipled\r\nradical leaders by men more virtuous and ingenuous. The great\r\nmanufacturing towns and districts, composed mainly of the lower orders\r\nof society, and devoted to the interests of commerce, as opposed to the\r\nnarrow demands of the agricultural interest, have, owing in a great\r\ndegree to Mr. Bright's exertions, become pillars of his party. Lord\r\nPalmerston, than whom a more sagacious politician does not or has not\r\nexisted, testified his knowledge of the influence of the Bright party,\r\nby offering Mr. Cobden a seat in the Cabinet, and afterward by sending\r\nhim as special agent of England to negotiate a commercial treaty with\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nJohn Bright has always shown himself a staunch friend to the prosperity\r\nof the United States. Whenever an opportunity offered in which to\r\npropose this country as an example worthy of the imitation of his own\r\ncountrymen, he has never failed to urge the superiority of our system.\r\nHis political ideas, approaching to republicanism, and abhorring the\r\ndominance of hereditary aristocrats, and a political Church, have found\r\ntheir theories realized in the admirable machinery of our own\r\ngovernment. Untainted with that jealous prejudice which appears to\r\nanimate many of his fellow-citizens, he can discern, and is ready to\r\nacknowledge, the superior efficacy of the principles which underlie our\r\nConstitution. No one has, of late, been more earnest in denunciation of\r\nthe irritating policy of Great Britain toward America, than Mr. Bright.\r\n\r\nHis personal appearance is that of a hearty, good-natured, and yet\r\ndetermined Englishman, and both his form and face betoken the John Bull\r\nas much as any member of the House. His morals are of a high order, his\r\nhonesty proverbial, his courage undoubted, his social character amiable,\r\nand calculated to make him welcome to every circle. It is said, that\r\nalthough opposed in the extreme to the political doctrines of Lord\r\nDerby, his personal relations with that aristocratic nobleman are not\r\nonly friendly, but intimate; and that, after abusing one another lustily\r\nat Westminster, they retire together arm in arm, chatting and laughing\r\nas familiarly as if there never had been the least difference of opinion\r\nbetween them. Like Fox, in this particular, he never allows his partisan\r\nviews to interfere with his social relations; and although he is a\r\nfierce and bitter antagonist on the benches of Parliament, no one is a\r\nmore constant or a more zealous friend in private life. His efforts have\r\nalways been enlisted in behalf of the education of the masses;\r\nconceiving that this is the foundation of a thoroughly popular political\r\nsystem, such as he is desirous to introduce into the British\r\nConstitution. Bred among a timid and peaceful sect, his opposition to\r\nwars has been determined and earnest; and he was one of those who, in\r\n1854, sent a deputation to the Emperor Nicholas to urge an abandonment\r\nof his war policy, and the maintenance of peace, as the duty of a\r\nChristian race. He is, however, rather fitted to be a reformer and\r\nagitator than a statesman. He has all that enthusiasm, all that energy,\r\nall that courage, all that stubborn perseverance in the pursuit of his\r\npurpose, which distinguish the characters of those men who have\r\nconducted the great revolutions of society to a successful issue.\r\nPerhaps he would be found deficient in judging how far to proceed in\r\ninnovation; but this, though an important, is not an essential element\r\nin the composition of the mere reformer. It is for him to lead on the\r\npeople to great and startling changes, to overturn tyrannies, to break\r\ndown old forms, to inculcate novel precepts, to regenerate public\r\nsentiment. These rather require an impetuous spirit, a bold heart, an\r\nactive and restless mind, than calmness, judgment, and deliberation. It\r\nis when a new polity is to be erected, when revolution has passed away,\r\nand the crisis reached and left, when a constitution is to be framed,\r\nand new principles are to be brought to their test, that the steady\r\nprocess of a sound judgment is called into requisition. Then it is that\r\nthe reformer yields to the statesman; that impulse retires before\r\nreason; that passion and confusion become subordinated to the elements\r\nof order and the authority of intellect. Many have been both the\r\nreformers producing and the statesmen correcting, revolutions; minds\r\nwhich, with the fire of enthusiasm, and the hot impulse of indignation\r\nat wrongs done, have united a judicious discrimination, a cool faculty\r\nof reflection, and the power of separating the benefits from the evils\r\nof revolution.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that Mr. Bright would be a fearless and zealous reformer;\r\nit is doubtful whether he would not give place to others in the\r\nafter-work. Well qualified to lead an enthusiastic faction to a crusade\r\nagainst precedent and authority, he has thus far failed to show himself\r\ncapable of conducting an administration. Among the statesmen of modern\r\ntimes, honesty and enthusiasm are not qualities which control the policy\r\nof the state. Compare the crafty demeanor, the dubious expressions, the\r\ncautious statements of Earl Russell, with the plain, rude, blunt\r\nharangues of Mr. Bright, and we perceive the qualities which have\r\nelevated the former, and those which have kept the latter in the\r\nbackground. Lord Russell thinks what is for his interest to think; Mr.\r\nBright thinks what that homely monitor, his conscience, urges on him.\r\nLord Russell might adopt all the consequences of universal suffrage, and\r\nthe principles of free trade, if he could still sit at the\r\ncouncil-board, and dictate dispatches with a double meaning to foreign\r\ngovernments; but he fears to go beyond, though he nearly approaches, the\r\nline which separates the popular from the unpopular reformer.\r\nExpediency, on the contrary, forms no part of Mr. Bright's creed; and,\r\nnot being a scion of a noble and illustrious house, nor having attained\r\na position in the state which might have made him a conservative, he has\r\nno hesitation in announcing his opinions in favor of universal suffrage\r\nand free trade, in opposition of a dominant aristocracy, and in defiance\r\nof a religious establishment, and dares with provoking coolness the\r\nretaliation of the great and powerful of the land.\r\n\r\nMr. Bright's oratory is of a fresh, vigorous, and versatile character,\r\nand never fails to draw a multitude to the House when it is announced\r\nthat he is to speak. Unlike the hesitating and timid delivery of\r\nRussell, the rapid jargon of Palmerston, the rich and graceful\r\nintonation of Gladstone, or the splendid sarcasm of Disraeli, his\r\neloquence is bold, masculine, and ringing, and gives a better idea of\r\nintellectual and physical strength than any other speaker in the House.\r\nAlthough blunt, and careless of the feelings of others, there is a\r\ncertain elegance in every sentence, which softens the rude sentiment\r\ninto a vigorous anathema. Accurate in fact, naturally easy in delivery,\r\nbitter in irony, and ingenuous in argument, few are ready to meet him on\r\nthe floor of the Commons. He is a fair specimen of what we hear called\r\n'the fine old English gentleman,' without the ignorance, the bigotry,\r\nthe awkwardness, and the peevishness, which go to make up the characters\r\nof a large proportion of the country baronets and gentry; that is, he is\r\nhearty, cordial, and merry, entering with enthusiasm into whatever he\r\nproposes to do, and determined to leave no stone unturned to accomplish\r\nit. If he should live to see the day when his countrymen shall adopt the\r\nviews of which he is the foremost champion, no honor of the state will\r\nbe denied him, and his name will rank with those of William of Orange,\r\nand Lord Grey, as the regenerators of the British Constitution; and if\r\nhe does not, he can not but be respected, as Milton and Sidney are, by\r\nfuture generations, for his honesty, his patriotism under difficulty,\r\nand his fearless spirit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE ANTE-NORSE DISCOVERERS OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\n(CONCLUDED.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHINESE IN MEXICO IN THE FIFTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\nThe reader who would ascertain by the map whether it was likely that at\r\nan early period intercourse could have taken place between Eastern Asia\r\nand Western America, will have no difficulty in deciding on the\r\ngeographical possibility of such transit. At Behring's Straits only\r\nforty miles of water intervene between the two continents, while routes\r\nby the Aleutian Islands, or through the Sea of Ochotsk, present no great\r\ndifficulties, even to a timid navigator. And the Chinese and Japanese of\r\nearlier ages were by no means timid in their voyages. It is only within\r\ntwo centuries that their governments, alarmed by the growing power of\r\nthe Western world, and desirous of keeping their subjects at home,\r\nprohibited the construction of strictly sea-worthy and sea-faring\r\nvessels. Even within the memory of man, Japanese junks have been driven\r\nto the California coasts.\r\n\r\nImpressed by the probability of such intercommunication, Johann\r\nFriedrich Neumann, a learned German Orientalist, while residing in\r\nChina, during the years 1829-30, for the purpose of collecting Chinese\r\nworks, after investigating the subject, published its results in a work,\r\nsubsequently translated by me, under his supervision. Among the first\r\nresults of his inquiries, was the fact that 'during the course of many\r\ncenturies, the Chinese acquired a surprisingly accurate knowledge of the\r\nnorth-east coast of Asia, extending, as their records in astronomy and\r\nnatural history prove, to the sixty-fifth degree of latitude, and even\r\nto the Arctic Ocean.' From the Chinese _Book of Mountains and Seas_, it\r\nappears that the Esquimaux and their country were well known to the\r\nChinese, and that in the sixth century, natives of the North and of the\r\nislands bordering on America, came with Japanese embassies to China.\r\nWhen it is borne in mind that the early Chinese geographers and\r\nastronomers determined on the situations of these northern regions, with\r\nan accuracy which has been of late years surprisingly verified by\r\neminent European men of science, and when we learn that the Year Books\r\nor annals of China continually repeat these observations, and that their\r\naccounts of the natives of the islands within a few miles of the\r\nAmerican shore are as undoubtedly correct as they are minute, we\r\ncertainly have good reason for assuming that their description of the\r\nmain land and its inhabitants is well worthy, if not of implicit belief,\r\nat least of an investigation by the savans of the Western World. Be it\r\nborne in mind, also, that during the first eight centuries of our own\r\nChristian era, a spirit of discovery in foreign lands was actively at\r\nwork all over the East. In the words of Neumann:\r\n\r\n    'In the first century of our reckoning, the pride and vanity\r\n    induced by the Chinese social system was partly broken by the\r\n    progress of Buddhism over all Eastern Asia. He who believed in the\r\n    divine mission of the son of the King of Kaphilapura, must\r\n    recognize every man as his brother and equal by birth; yes, must\r\n    strive (for the old Buddhism has this in common with the Christian\r\n    religion) to extend the joyful mission of salvation to all the\r\n    nations on the earth, and to attain this end must suffer, like the\r\n    type of the God Incarnate, all earthly pain and persecution. So we\r\n    find that a number of Buddhist monks and preachers have at distant\r\n    times wandered to all known and unknown parts of the world, either\r\n    to obtain information with regard to their distant\r\n    co-religionists, or to preach the doctrine of the Holy Trinity to\r\n    unbelievers. The official accounts which these missionaries have\r\n    rendered of their travels, and of which we possess several\r\n    _entire_, considered as sources of information with regard to\r\n    different lands and nations, belong to the most instructive and\r\n    important part of Chinese literature. From these sources we have\r\n    derived, in a great degree, that information which we possess\r\n    regarding North-eastern Asia and the Western coasts of America\r\n    during centuries which have been hitherto vailed in the deepest\r\n    obscurity.'\r\n\r\nThe earliest account, given of extended travels on the North-American\r\ncontinent describes a journey from Tahan or Aloska to a distance, and\r\ninto a region which indicates the north-west coast of Mexico and the\r\nvicinity of San Blas. The following is a literal translation made from\r\nthe original Chinese report, by Neumann:\r\n\r\n    'THE KINGDOM OF FUSANG, OR MEXICO.\r\n\r\n    'During the reign of the dynasty _Tsi_, in the first year of the\r\n    year-naming[E] 'Everlasting Origin,' (Anno Domini 499,) came a\r\n    Buddhist priest from this kingdom, who bore the cloister name of\r\n    Roci-schin, that is, Universal Compassion, (_Allgemeins\r\n    Mitleiden_: according to King-tscheu it signifies 'an old\r\n    name,[F]') to the present district of Hukuang, and those\r\n    surrounding it, who narrated that 'Fusang is about twenty thousand\r\n    Chinese miles in an easterly direction from Tahan, and east of the\r\n    middle kingdom. Many Fusang-trees grow there, whose leaves\r\n    resemble the Dryanda Cordifolia;[G] the sprouts, on the contrary,\r\n    resemble those of the bamboo-tree,[H] and are eaten by the\r\n    inhabitants of the land. The fruit is like a pear in form, but is\r\n    red. From the bark they prepare a sort of linen, which they use\r\n    for clothing, and also a sort of ornamented stuff.[I] The houses\r\n    are built of wooden beams; fortified and walled places a unknown.\r\n\r\n    'THEIR WRITING AND CIVIL REGULATIONS.\r\n\r\n    'They have written characters in this land, and prepare paper from\r\n    the bark of the Fusang. The people have no weapons, and make no\r\n    wars, but in the arrangements of the kingdom they have a northern\r\n    and a southern prison. Trifling offenders were lodged in the\r\n    southern, but those confined for greater offenses in the northern;\r\n    so that those who were about to receive grace could be placed in\r\n    the southern prison, and those to the contrary in the northern.\r\n    Those men and women who were imprisoned for life were allowed to\r\n    marry. The boys resulting from these marriages were, at the age of\r\n    eight years, sold for slaves; the girls not until their ninth\r\n    year. If a man of any note was found guilty of crimes, an assembly\r\n    was held: it must be in an excavated place, (_Grabe_.) There they\r\n    strewed ashes over him, and bade him farewell, as if he were\r\n    dying. If the offender were one of a lower class, he alone was\r\n    punished; but when of rank, the degradation was extended to his\r\n    children and grandchildren. With those of the highest rank it\r\n    attained to the seventh generation.\r\n\r\n\r\n    'THE KINGDOM AND THE NOBLES.\r\n\r\n    'The name of the king is pronounced _Ichi_. The nobles of the\r\n    first class are termed Tuilu; of the second, Little Tuilu; and of\r\n    the third, Na-to-scha. When the prince goes forth he is\r\n    accompanied by horns and trumpets. The color of his clothes\r\n    changes with the different years. In the first two of the ten-year\r\n    cyclus they are blue; in the two next, red; in the two following,\r\n    yellow; in the two next, red; and in the last two, black.\r\n\r\n\r\n    'MANNERS AND CUSTOMS.\r\n\r\n    'The horns of the oxen are so large that they contain ten bushels,\r\n    (Schaeffel.) They use them to hold all manner of things. Horses,\r\n    oxen and stags, are harnessed to their wagons. Stags are used here\r\n    as cattle are used in the Middle Kingdom, and from the milk of the\r\n    hind they make butter. The red pears of the Fusang tree keep good\r\n    throughout the year. Moreover, they have apples and reeds; from\r\n    the latter they prepare mats. _No iron is found in this land; but\r\n    copper, gold, and silver are not prized, and do not serve as a\r\n    medium of exchange in the market._\r\n\r\n    'Marriage is determined upon in the following manner. The suitor\r\n    builds himself a hut before the door of the house where the one\r\n    longed for dwells, and waters and cleans the ground every morning\r\n    and evening. When a year has passed by, if the maiden is not\r\n    inclined to marry him, he departs; should she he willing, it is\r\n    completed. When the parents die, they fast seven days. For the\r\n    death of the paternal or maternal grandfather they lament five\r\n    days; at the death of elder or younger sisters or brothers, uncles\r\n    or aunts, three days. They then sit from morning to evening before\r\n    an image of the ghost, absorbed in prayer, but wear no mourning\r\n    clothes. When the king dies, the son who succeeds him does not\r\n    busy himself for three years with state affairs.\r\n\r\n    'In earlier times these people lived not according to the laws of\r\n    Buddha. But it happened that in the second year-naming 'Great\r\n    Light,' of song, (A.D. 458,) five beggar monks, from the kingdom\r\n    Kipin, went to this land, extended over it the religion of Buddha,\r\n    and with it his holy writings and images. They instructed the\r\n    people in the principles of monastic life, and so changed their\r\n    manners.'\r\n\r\nSuch is the account of Mexico, as given by the old Buddhist monk\r\nHoei-schin. What is there authentically known of ancient America and its\r\ninhabitants which confirms his account?\r\n\r\nIn the Fusang tree we have, according to the opinion of Neumann, the\r\n_Agave Americana_ or Great American Aloe, called by the Indians Maguey,\r\nwhich is remarkably abundant in the plains of 'New-Spain,' and which\r\nsupplies so many of the wants of its inhabitants even at the present\r\nday. An intoxicating drink, paper, thread, ropes, pins, and needles,\r\n(from the thorns,) and clothing, are all furnished by it, so that a\r\ntraveler, observing the ease with which these are obtained, declares\r\nthat in Mexico the Maguey plant must first be exterminated ere the sloth\r\nand idleness which now so generally afflict them, can be checked. Such a\r\ncurious plant, supplying to such an extent, and so exclusively, so many\r\nof the needs of life, would naturally be the first object noted by an\r\nexplorer.\r\n\r\nVery remarkable is the observation that 'in this land no iron is found,\r\nand that copper, gold, and silver, are not prized;' from which we may\r\ninfer that they were known, and probably abundant, and that they 'do not\r\nserve as a medium of exchange in the market.' It is needless to point\r\nout the fact that this was the case not only in ancient Mexico, but also\r\nin Peru, and that these were probably the only countries on the face of\r\nthe earth where 'the precious metals' were held in such indifference. Be\r\nit observed that the monk Hoei-schin says nothing of the abundance of\r\ngold and silver; he simply remarks as a curious fact, that they were not\r\nused as a circulating medium.\r\n\r\nIn commenting on this record, Neumann judiciously reminds the reader\r\nthat the information given by Hoei-schin and other Buddhist travelers,\r\ngoes back into a period long anterior to the most remote periods alluded\r\nto in the wavering legends of the Aztecs, resting upon uncertain\r\ninterpretations of hieroglyphics. One thing we know, that in America as\r\nin Europe, one wave of emigration and conquest swept after another, each\r\ndestroying in a great measure all traces of its predecessor. Thus in\r\nPeru, the Inca race ruled over the lower caste, and would in time have\r\nprobably extinguished it. But the Incas themselves were preceded by\r\nanother and more gifted race, since it is evident that these unknown\r\npredecessors were far more gifted than themselves as architects. 'Who\r\nthis race were,' says Prescott, (_Conquest of Peru_, chap. i. pp. 12,\r\n13, ed. 1847,) 'and whence they came, may afford a tempting theme for\r\ninquiry to the speculative antiquarian. But it is a land of darkness\r\nthat lies far beyond the domain of history.'\r\n\r\nBut as the American waves of conquest flowed South, it is no extravagant\r\nhypothesis to assume that the race of men whom the monk encountered in\r\nMexico may possibly have had something in common with what was afterward\r\nfound further south, in the land of the Incas. One thing is certain;\r\nthat there is a singularly Peruvian air in all that this short narrative\r\ntells us of the land 'Fusang.' Fortified places, he says, were unknown;\r\nand Prescott speaks of the system of fortifications established through\r\nthe empire as though it had originated--as it most undoubtedly\r\ndid--with the Incas. Most extraordinary, however, is the remark of the\r\nmonk, that the houses are built with wooden beams. As houses the world\r\nover are constructed in this manner, the remark might seem almost\r\nsuperfluous. It is worth observing that the Peruvians built their houses\r\nwith wooden beams, and as Prescott tells us, 'knew no better way of\r\nholding the beams together than tying them with thongs of _maguey_.' Now\r\nbe it observed, that the monk makes a direct transition from speaking of\r\nthe textile fiber and fabric of the maguey to the wooden beams of the\r\nhouses--a coïncidence which has at least a color of proof. It may be\r\nremarked, by the way, that this construction of houses 'tied up,' was\r\nadmirably adapted to a land of earthquakes, as in Mexico, and that\r\nPrescott himself testifies that a number of them 'still survive, while\r\nthe more modern constructions of the conquerors are buried in ruins.'\r\n\r\nMost strikingly Peruvian is the monk's account of 'the Kingdom and the\r\nNobles.' The name Ichi, is strikingly suggestive of the natural Chinese\r\npronunciation of the word Inca. The stress laid on the three grades of\r\nnobles, suggests the Peruvian Inca castes of lower grade, as well as the\r\nMexican; while the stately going forth of the king, 'accompanied by\r\nhorns and trumpets,' vividly recalls Prescott's account of the\r\njourneyings of the Peruvian potentate. The change of the color of his\r\ngarments according to the astronomical cycle, is, however, more\r\nthoroughly in accordance with the spirit of the institutions of the\r\nChildren of the Sun than any thing which we have met in the whole of\r\nthis strange and obsolete record. 'The ritual of the Incas,' says\r\nPrescott, 'involved a routine of observances as complex and elaborate as\r\never distinguished that of any nation, whether pagan or Christian. Each\r\nmonth had its appropriate festival, or rather festivals. The four\r\nprincipal _had reference to the Sun_, and commemorated the great periods\r\nof his annual progress, the solstices and equinoxes. Garments of a\r\npeculiar wool, and feathers of a peculiar color, were reserved to the\r\nIncas. I can not identify the blue, red, yellow, and black, but it is\r\nworthy of remark that the rainbow was his special attribute or\r\nscutcheon, and that the mere fact that his whole life was passed in\r\naccordance with the requisitions of astronomical festivals, and that\r\ndifferent colors were reserved to him and identified with him,\r\nestablishes a strange analogy with the narrative of Hoei-schin.\r\n\r\n'Of this subject of the cycles and change of colors corresponding to\r\nastronomical mutations, it is worth noting that Montesinos[J] expressly\r\nasserts that the Peruvians threw their years into cycles of ten; a\r\ncurious fact which has escaped the notice of Neumann, who conjectures\r\nthat 'it may have been a subdivision of the Aztec period, or have even\r\nbeen used as an independent period, as was indeed the case by the\r\nChinese, who term their notations 'stems.' It is worthy of remark,' he\r\nadds, 'that among the Mongols and Mantchous these 'stems' are named\r\nafter colors which perhaps have some relation to the several colors of\r\nthe royal clothing in the cycles of 'Fusang.' These Tartaric tribes term\r\nthe first two years of the ten-year _cyclus_, 'green and greenish,' the\r\ntwo next, 'red and reddish,' and soon, yellow and yellowish, white and\r\nwhitish, and finally, black and blackish.'\r\n\r\nI am perfectly aware that Peru is not Mexico; but I beg the reader to\r\nkeep in mind my former observation, that Mexico _might_ have been at one\r\ntime peopled by a race who had Peruvian customs, which in after-years\r\nwere borne by them far to the South. The ancient mythology and\r\nethnography of Mexico presents, however, a mass of curious identities\r\nwith that of Asia. Both Mexico and Peru had the tradition of a deluge,\r\nfrom which seven prisoners escaped; in the hieroglyphs of the former\r\ncountry, these seven are represented as issuing from an egg.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that a Peruvian tradition declares the first\r\nmissionaries of civilization who visited them to have been white and\r\nbearded. 'This may remind us,' says Prescott, 'of the tradition existing\r\namong the Aztecs, in respect to Quetzalcoatl, the good deity, who, with\r\na similar garb and aspect, came up the great plateau from the East, on a\r\nlike benevolent mission to the natives.' In like manner the _Aesir_,\r\nchildren of Light, or of the Sun, came from the East to Scandinavia, and\r\ntaught the lore of the Gods.\r\n\r\nThe Peruvian embalming of the royal dead takes us back to Egypt; the\r\nburning of the wives of the deceased Incas, reveals India; the\r\nsingularly patriarchal character of the whole Peruvian policy is like\r\nthat of China in the olden time; while the system of espionage, of\r\ntranquillity, of physical well-being, and the iron-like immovability in\r\nwhich the whole social frame was cast, brings before the reader Japan,\r\nas it even now exists. In fact, there is something strangely Japanese in\r\nthe entire _cultus_ of Peru, as described by all writers.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that the Supreme Being of the Peruvians was worshiped\r\nunder the names of _Pachacomac_, 'he who sustains, or gives life to the\r\nuniverse,' and of _Viracocha_, 'Foam of the Sea,' a name strikingly\r\nrecalling that of Venus Aphrodité, the female second principle in all\r\nancient mythologies. Not less curious was the institution of the Vestal\r\nVirgins of the Sun, who were buried alive if detected in an intrigue,\r\nand whose duty it was to keep burning the sacred fire obtained at the\r\nfestival of Raymi.\r\n\r\n    'Vigilemque sacraverat ignem Excubias divûm æternas.'\r\n\r\nThis fire was obtained as by the ancient Romans, on a precisely similar\r\noccasion, by means of a concave mirror of polished metal. The Incas, in\r\norder to preserve purity of race, married their own sisters, as did the\r\nkings of Persia and other Oriental nations, urged by a like feeling of\r\npride. Among the Peruvians, _Mama_, signified 'mother,' while _Papa_,\r\nwas applied to the chief priest. 'With both, the term seems to embrace\r\nin its most comprehensive sense, the paternal relation, in which it is\r\nmore familiarly employed by most of the nations of Europe.'\r\n\r\nIt should be borne in mind, that as in the case of the Green Corn\r\nfestival, many striking analogies can be established between the Indian\r\ntribes of North-America and the Peruvians. Gallatin has shown the\r\naffinity of languages between all the American nations; at the remote\r\nage when the monk visited Mexico, it is possible that the _first race_\r\nwhich subsequently spread southward occupied the entire north.\r\n\r\nLet the reader also remember that while the proofs of the existence or\r\nresidence of Orientals in America are extremely vague and uncertain, and\r\nsupported only by coïncidences, (singular and inexplicable as the latter\r\nmay be,) the _antecedent probability_ of their having come hither, is\r\nfar stronger than that of the Norse discovery of this country, or even\r\nthat of Columbus himself. When we see an aggressive nation, with a\r\nreligious propaganda, boasting a commerce and gifted with astronomers\r\nand geographers of no mean ability, (and the accuracy of the old Chinese\r\nmen of science has been frequently verified,) advancing century after\r\ncentury in a certain direction, chronicling correctly every step made,\r\nand accurately describing the geography and ethnography of a certain\r\nregion, we have no good ground to deny the last advance which their\r\nauthentic history claims to have made, however indisposed we may be to\r\nadmit it. One thing, at least, will probably be cheerfully conceded by\r\nthe impartial reader; that the subject well deserves further\r\ninvestigation, and that it is to be hoped that it will obtain it from\r\nthose students who are at present so earnestly occupied in exploring the\r\nmysteries of Oriental literature.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSTATE RIGHTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe theory of State Rights, as expounded by its advocates in its\r\napplication to the several States of the American Union, is subversive\r\nof all government, and calculated to destroy our political organization.\r\nIts tendency is to weaken the central government by minute division of\r\nthe power necessary for its maintainance. Without power to make its\r\nauthority respected, no government can live. The doctrine of State\r\nSovereignty detracts from this authority by lessening the power which\r\nupholds it. Thirty-four-States, each claiming exclusive authority to act\r\nindependently on any given subject, have only one thirty-fourth part of\r\nthe strength that they would have, were they all acting under and\r\ncontrolled by one central head. That central head in our Union is the\r\nFederal Government, formed by and growing out of the Constitution, and\r\nit must exist for the protection of each of its thirty-four members, as\r\nwell as for itself, the connecting power. Its acts must not be disputed\r\nby any one of the States or by any number of them acting in concert. If\r\none or more States may defy the central authority or attempt to withdraw\r\nfrom its government, any other States may do likewise, to the ruin of\r\nthe political fabric erected at so much cost, and in its place would\r\nspring up scores of weak and unprotected communities. But, says the\r\nState rights advocate, this central power will have too much authority,\r\ntoo much control over the States; will become despotic, and in time\r\ndestroy the liberties of the people. How? By whom will those liberties\r\nbe destroyed? This central power, styled the Federal Government, is\r\nformed by the people, is of the people, is for the people, and has only\r\nsuch power as the people gave it; and thus being of and from the people,\r\nit (or they) can not destroy its (or their) own liberties. Were our\r\ngovernment hereditary instead of elective; were our institutions\r\nmonarchical instead of republican; had we privileged classes perpetuated\r\nby primogeniture, there might be some danger of placing too much power\r\nin the hands of the Federal Government; but formed as our institutions\r\nare, framed as our Constitution is, educated as our people are, there\r\ncan be no fear of having the central power or general Federal Government\r\ntoo strong, or its authority supreme. Without strength there can be no\r\nauthority; without authority there can be no respect; without respect\r\nthere can be no government; without government there can be no\r\ncivilization. The doctrine of State rights as applied to the communities\r\nforming the American Union, elevates the State over the nation, demands\r\nthat the Federal shall yield to the State laws, and completely ignores\r\nthe supremacy of the united authority of the whole people. This theory\r\ncarried out logically, would make counties equal to States; towns equal\r\nto counties; wards and districts equal to towns; neighborhoods equal to\r\ndistricts and wards; and to come down to the last application of the\r\nprinciple, every one man in a neighborhood equal to the whole, in fact,\r\nsuperior, if the State rights doctrine be true, that the State is\r\nsupreme within its own limits. The application of this principle ends\r\nsociety by destroying the order based on authority, and placing the\r\nState above the Nation, and the individual above the State. Civilized\r\nsocieties are but the aggregation of persons coming or remaining\r\ntogether for mutual interest and protection. This mutual interest\r\nrequires certain rules for the protection of the weak from the\r\nencroachments of the strong in the society, as well as from outside\r\nenemies. These rules take the form of laws. These laws must be\r\nadministered; their administration requires power. This power is placed\r\nin the hands of certain members of this society, community, or State, as\r\nthe case may be, for the good of the whole State, and each individual\r\nclaiming protection from the State, or whose interest is promoted by\r\nbeing a member thereof, is under moral as well as legal obligations to\r\nsubmit to this authority thus exercised by the chosen executors of the\r\npublic will. Rights that might pertain to one man on an island by\r\nhimself, do not attach to man in civilized communities. There he must\r\nnot go beyond the landmarks established by law, and he agrees to this\r\narrangement by remaining in the State or community. The same principle\r\nis equally applicable to the States of the American Union. Before the\r\nadoption of the Federal Constitution, they were separate, distinct, and\r\nso far as any central head or supreme governing power was concerned,\r\nindependent States, or, in fact, sovereignties. True, they had tried to\r\nget along under a sort of confederation agreement, a kind of temporary\r\nalliance for offensive and defensive ends, but which failed from its own\r\ninherent weakness, from the lack of that cohesiveness which nothing but\r\ncentralization can give. Prior to the adoption of the Federal\r\nConstitution, these different States were like so many different\r\nindividuals outside of any regular society; were merely so many isolated\r\naggregations of non-nationalized individuals. Experience showed them\r\ntheir unfortunate condition; as separate States they had no strength to\r\nrepel a common enemy, no credit, no money, no authority, commanded no\r\nrespect. So it is with an individual outside of society. These States\r\nwere then in the enjoyment--no, not in the enjoyment but merely in\r\npossession--of State rights to the fullest extent. They had the right to\r\nbe poor; the right to be weak; the right to get in debt; the right to\r\nissue bills of credit, (was any one found who thought it right to take\r\nthem?) the right to wage war with any of their neighbors; the right to\r\ndo any and all acts pertaining to an independent sovereignty; but these\r\nrights were not all that the people of these States desired; and after\r\ntrying the independent and the confederate State policy until experience\r\nhad shown the utter fallacy of both, they met in convention and passed\r\nthe present Constitution, and formed themselves into ONE NATION. This\r\nConstitution, compact, copartnership, confederation, combination, or\r\nwhatever it may be called, was and is the written foundation\r\n(voluntarily made) on which the NATION is built and maintained.\r\n\r\nThe charter, instrument, or Constitution, defines, by common consent and\r\nmutual agreement of the parties voluntarily forming it, the powers,\r\nrights, and duties of the national government growing out of and based\r\non this Constitution. Among the powers thus delegated to the National or\r\nFederal Government, and to be used by the legislative authority thereof,\r\nare the following:\r\n\r\n    'ARTICLE I.--SECTION 8.\r\n\r\n    'The Congress shall have power--\r\n\r\n    '1. To lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, to pay\r\n    the debts, and provide for the common defense and general welfare\r\n    of the United States; but all duties, imposts, and excises shall\r\n    be uniform throughout the United States.\r\n\r\n    '2. To borrow money on the credit of the United States.\r\n\r\n    '3. To regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the\r\n    several States, and with the Indian tribes.\r\n\r\n    '4. To establish a uniform rule of naturalization, and uniform\r\n    laws on the subject of bankruptcies, throughout the United States.\r\n\r\n    '5. To coin money, regulate the value thereof, and of foreign\r\n    coin, and fix the standard of weights and measures.\r\n\r\n    '6. To provide for the punishment of counterfeiting the securities\r\n    and current coin of the United States.\r\n\r\n    '7. To establish post-offices and post-roads.\r\n\r\n    '8. To promote the progress of science and useful arts, by\r\n    securing, for limited times, to authors and inventors the\r\n    exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.\r\n\r\n    '9. To constitute tribunals inferior to the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\n    '10. To define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the\r\n    high seas, and offenses against the law of nations.\r\n\r\n    '11. To declare war, grant letters of marque and reprisal, and\r\n    make rules concerning captures on land and water.\r\n\r\n    '12. To raise and support armies; but no appropriation of money\r\n    to that use shall be for a longer term than two years.\r\n\r\n    '13. To provide and maintain a navy.\r\n\r\n    '14. To make rules for the government and regulation of the land\r\n    and naval forces.\r\n\r\n    '15. To provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws\r\n    of the Union, suppress insurrections, and repel invasions.\r\n\r\n    '16. To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the\r\n    militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in\r\n    the service of the United States, reserving to the States\r\n    respectively the appointment of the officers, and the authority of\r\n    training the militia, according to the discipline proscribed by\r\n    Congress.\r\n\r\n    '18. To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for\r\n    carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers\r\n    vested by this Constitution in the government of the United\r\n    States, or in any department or officer thereof.'\r\n\r\nThe first two words in this section--'the Congress'--completely annul\r\nthe separate integrity of States. The Congress of what, and for what?\r\nThe Congress of the UNITED STATES, acting for the UNITED States, as a\r\nUNIT, a WHOLE, a UNION. The only allusion in this section to any thing\r\nlike a right existing in any State after the adoption of the\r\nConstitution, is the right to officer the militia, and these officers\r\nare to 'train' the militia, _under the direction of Congress_, and not\r\nunder State laws--a clause which of itself strikes a decisive blow at\r\nthe theory of independent State rights. In no one of these\r\nspecifications is there a single allusion to any 'State.' Every power\r\nenumerated is given to the '_United_ States,' to the 'Union' formed by\r\nvirtue of the Constitution. Never was there a more perfect absorption of\r\natoms into one mass, than in these specifications; but to make the\r\nprinciple still stronger, and as if to remove any doubt as to 'State\r\nrights,' the first clause of the Ninth Section of the same Article\r\nexpressly prohibits any State from importing certain persons after a\r\ngiven date, which, when it arrived, (in 1808,) Congress passed a\r\nnational law stopping the slave-trade--a trade that some of the States\r\nwould have been glad to encourage, or at least, allow, if they had had\r\nauthority to do so. This right was taken from them by the Constitution,\r\nin the year 1808; up to that time they had that right; but after that\r\ndate the right no longer existed, and Congress passed the law referred\r\nto, in accordance with the power given them by this clause of the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nBut this First Article of Section Nine is not all in that section that\r\nsmothers State rights; for Article Five declares that vessels bound to\r\nor from one State need not enter, clear, or pay duties in another. Why\r\nthis specification, if the States were to be supreme in their own\r\nlimits? (and this doctrine of State rights is, in its essence,\r\nsupremacy.) Independent states exact clearances and entrances, and\r\ndemand duties from foreign vessels, but never from their own. State\r\nrights are ignored in this Article. But to prevent any possibility of\r\nany State ever exercising the rights of sovereignty now claimed by the\r\nadvocates of this most pernicious doctrine, from which has grown the\r\npresent gigantic rebellion, Section Ten, of the same Article, goes on to\r\ndeclare that--\r\n\r\n    '1. No State shall enter into any treaty, alliance, or\r\n    confederation; grant letters of marque and reprisal; coin money;\r\n    emit bills of credit; make any thing but gold and silver coin a\r\n    tender in payment of debts; pass any bill of attainder, _ex post\r\n    facto_ law, or law impairing the obligation of contracts; or grant\r\n    any title of nobility.\r\n\r\n    '2. No State shall, without the consent of Congress, lay any\r\n    imposts or duties on imports or exports, except what may be\r\n    absolutely necessary for executing its inspection laws; and the\r\n    net produce of all duties and imposts laid by any State on imports\r\n    or exports, shall be for the use of the treasury of the United\r\n    States; and all such laws shall be subject to the revision and\r\n    control of the Congress. No State shall, without the consent of\r\n    Congress, lay any duty on tonnage, keep troops or ships of war in\r\n    time of peace, enter into any agreement or compact with another\r\n    State or with a foreign power, or engage in war.'\r\n\r\nLanguage can not be stronger; intentions were never more clearly\r\nexpressed; thoughts were never more explicitly set forth in words.\r\nNothing is left for doubt; all is concise, positive, and binding.\r\nNothing is left to be guessed at; nothing left that could be construed\r\nto mean that States 'may' or 'may not.' 'SHALL' and 'SHALL NOT,' are the\r\nwords used to define what the States are to do or not to do. The very\r\nslight 'right' given to the States to lay duties for executing their\r\ninspection laws, carries with it a proviso, or command, that the\r\nproceeds of such duties must be paid into the National Treasury, and the\r\nvery laws that the States might pass for this purpose must be approved\r\nby 'THE CONGRESS.' What Congress? The Congress of the UNITED STATES--of\r\nthe UNION. Every vestige of State sovereignty, of 'State rights,' is\r\nutterly annihilated in these clauses.\r\n\r\nIndependent, sovereign states may and do make treaties, alliances, grant\r\nletters of marque, or coin money; in fact, no 'State' or sovereignty can\r\nexist without these powers; and the fact that these powers are all taken\r\nfrom and denied to the States of the American Union, is conclusive proof\r\nthat the framers of the Constitution did not intend to allow the States\r\nthe sovereignty now claimed for them, and which the rebellious States\r\nare endeavoring to maintain. This heresy must be exorcised now and\r\nforever.\r\n\r\nIs there any thing more in the Constitution (and bear in mind that no\r\nright is claimed for any State except in accordance with this\r\ninstrument, which is still in full force except in those rebellious\r\nStates where this disorganizing doctrine of 'State rights' has\r\nuncontrolled sway) making the Union supreme and the States subordinate?\r\nWhat says the following section?\r\n\r\n    'Full faith and credit shall be given in each State to the public\r\n    acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other State. And\r\n    the Congress may, by general laws, prescribe the manner in which\r\n    such acts, records, and proceedings shall be proved, and the\r\n    effect thereof.'\r\n\r\nA State, therefore, _may_ so legislate, that is, it _may_ have acts and\r\nrecords, but each other State SHALL give to the records and proceedings\r\nof all the rest 'full faith and credit.' Does not this enactment\r\nthoroughly negative all theories of the exclusive supremacy of State\r\nrights? Independent sovereign States do not, in the absence of treaties,\r\ngive any faith or credit to the records or proceedings of other\r\nindependent states. Our States are not only compelled to do this, by\r\nthis section, but must do so in accordance with the manner prescribed by\r\n'the Congress' of the UNITED STATES, of the UNION, and of the NATION. No\r\nother congress is mentioned.\r\n\r\n    'SECTION 2.\r\n\r\n    'The citizens of each State shall be entitled to all privileges\r\n    and immunities of citizens in the several States.'\r\n\r\nBy this clause a native or naturalized citizen of Maine can conduct\r\nbusiness, hold and convey real estate (the highest civil, social, and\r\njudicial tests of citizenship) in the State of Georgia. The citizen of\r\nMinnesota can do likewise in New-York, and so of each and in all the\r\nStates. Independent states or supreme sovereignties do not allow these\r\nprivileges to any but their own citizens. The United States do not,\r\nneither do other nations. Citizenship must precede the right to hold and\r\nconvey real estate. All governments are naturally jealous of the alien.\r\nBy this clause, no American citizen can be an alien in any State of the\r\nAmerican Union. He is a citizen of the nation. No State can pass any law\r\ndemanding more of a citizen not born, though residing within its limits,\r\nthan from one born therein, or place him under any restrictions not\r\ncommon to the native or other citizen of such State. Not a vestige of\r\n'State' exclusiveness is there in the clause. Every idea of State\r\nsupremacy is blotted out by it. A heavier blow is, however, dealt at\r\nState rights in the following section:\r\n\r\n    'The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a\r\n    republican form of government, and shall protect each of them\r\n    against invasion, and, on application of the Legislature, or of\r\n    the Executive, (when the Legislature can not be convened,) against\r\n    domestic violence.'\r\n\r\nThe greatest of all rights that an independent state can or may have, is\r\nthe right to adopt its own form of government; but this clause\r\ncompletely destroys such right on the part of any State of this Union to\r\nframe its own form of government. No State, for example, can have a\r\nmonarchical government; since the United States are to guarantee a\r\n_republican_ form: and no State can adopt an hereditary or theocratic\r\ngovernment, because the UNITED STATES are bound to give each State a\r\nrepublican government. In like manner we might run through all the forms\r\nof government that have ever blessed or cursed our race, without finding\r\none which can he adopted by any State of this Union, except the single\r\nform of 'republican,' named in the Constitution. But can a State bereft\r\nof the right to frame its own mode of government be said to be possessed\r\nof '_sovereign_' 'State rights,' or could a more effectual provision\r\nagainst their development have been formed than this?\r\n\r\n    'This Constitution, and the laws of the United States which shall\r\n    be made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made, or which\r\n    shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be\r\n    the supreme law of the land; and the Judges in every State shall\r\n    be bound thereby; any thing in the Constitution or laws of any\r\n    State to the contrary notwithstanding.\r\n\r\n    'The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the\r\n    members of the several STATE LEGISLATURES, and all executive and\r\n    judicial officers, both of the United States and of the SEVERAL\r\n    STATES, shall be bound by oath or affirmation to support this\r\n    Constitution.'\r\n\r\nThis Constitution, these laws, these treaties, _shall be the supreme\r\nlaw_, no matter what 'State' constitutions and 'State' laws may declare.\r\n'Shall!' is the word, and there can be no doubt as to its meaning.\r\nAgain, members of the State Legislatures, and all officers of the\r\nseveral States 'shall' be bound to support the 'Constitution.' Where are\r\nthe 'State rights' in these clauses? Every State and every State\r\nofficial is made subordinate to and an executive of the acts of the\r\n'United States,' and the United States constitutes a '_nation_'. That is\r\nthe only word which meets our case. WE ARE A NATION, not 'a\r\ntenant-at-will sort of confederacy.'\r\n\r\nThe waters of the Bay of New-York and of the Hudson river flow entirely\r\nwithin the States of New-York and New-Jersey. One of the vested rights\r\nof an independent state, is that known as 'eminent domain,' or supreme\r\nownership, implying control. Apply this doctrine of State rights in this\r\ncase, or rather, allow it to be applied by the States named above, and\r\nthey could prevent the navigation of these waters by any but their own\r\ncitizens or those to whom they might grant that privilege. If this\r\ndoctrine of State rights is sound, these two States would have the right\r\nto levy tolls or duties on every vessel that sails those waters, as the\r\nState of New-York exacts tolls on her canals. Such power thus exercised,\r\nwould cripple commerce, inconvenience the public, and utterly destroy\r\nall comity between the States. This exacting tolls for navigation of\r\nwaters is one of the most offensive systems left us by past generations.\r\nIt is so odious that modern governments decline to submit to it in cases\r\nwhere there is no doubt as to 'State rights,' as in that of the 'Sound\r\nDues' exacted by Denmark. If, however, the State is supreme within its\r\nlimits, it has a perfect right to exact such tolls. But no State in this\r\nnation has any such right under the Constitution. Its existence would\r\ndestroy the Union by placing each State under the laws and exactions of\r\neither one of the others. The troubles growing out of such exactions\r\nwould beget dispute; these disputes would beget open strife, which would\r\nend in open rupture and the downfall of the NATIONAL UNION.\r\n\r\nThe 'UNITED STATES,' 'the Union,' 'the Nation,' are _supreme_. The\r\nStates, _as States_, are subordinate; as 'parts,' they are inferior to\r\nthe 'whole.' The 'State rights' doctrine is wrong, disorganizing,\r\ndestructive of national life, and must be destroyed.\r\n\r\nAgain, one grand evidence of a nation's or a people's civilization, is\r\nfound in the correspondence, written and printed, conducted by the\r\ncitizens. Barbarians have and need no correspondence. Civilization needs\r\nit, and can not exist without it. A migratory people like ours have more\r\ncorrespondence than older and less migratory nations. A citizen\r\nemigrating from Vermont to Illinois must correspond with the friends of\r\nhis old home. The old friend in Vermont must know how the absent one\r\n'gets along in the world.' To conduct this correspondence, the postal or\r\nmail service was devised. Before its existence the communication between\r\nseparated friends and business people was uncertain, irregular, and mere\r\nmatter of chance, to be conveyed by stray travelers, or not interchanged\r\nat all. The _necessities_ of civilization brought the postal or mail\r\nservice into action. To conduct this service over a nation, requires the\r\nright of passage through the entire limits of the nation. This right, to\r\nbe available, must have power to enforce its own requirements. It must\r\nbe _central_, CONTROLLING, SUPREME. Without these, there would be no\r\nsafety, no system, no uniformity, no regularity. To insure these to all\r\nthe people of the States, the Constitution has wisely placed these\r\npowers in 'THE CONGRESS' of the Union, of the 'NATION.' In accordance\r\nwith the powers thus vested in Congress, our present postal or mail\r\nservice has been created. No State has a right to set up its own mail or\r\npostal system. No State has a right to interfere with the transportation\r\nof the national mails. 'The UNITED STATES MAIL,' is the term used. If\r\nany State had a right to establish a mail within its own limits, it\r\nwould also have the right to prohibit or curtail the transportation of\r\nother States' mails through its limits. This right would destroy the\r\nentire system, and break up the interchange of correspondence so\r\nessential to our civilization. If the States had any such right, they\r\ncould affix discriminating tariffs on the correspondence of other States\r\npassing through them. The State of New-York could, if this right\r\nexisted, make the letters sent over its roads by the people of\r\nMassachusetts to the people of Ohio, pay just such tariffs for the\r\n'right of passage' as it might choose. The absurdity and utter\r\nunreasonableness of this claimed right is so apparent as to need no\r\nargument against it.\r\n\r\nThe exercise of this pretended right by the Southern States has caused\r\nthe present rebellion. But for this doctrine we should not be expending\r\na million a day in supporting six hundred thousand men in camp, who\r\nought to be producers for the support of life instead of missionaries of\r\ndeath. This war is the legitimate result of this heresy of 'State\r\nrights.' If this doctrine had never been put in practice, we should not\r\nnow have slavery to curse us with its degrading, inhumanizing\r\ninfluences. Slavery exists in _violation_ of the Constitution. Slavery\r\nwas never established by that document. The States violated it in their\r\nattempts at legalizing it. All their laws declaring that the _status_ of\r\nthe child must be that of the mother, are but so many 'BILLS OF\r\nATTAINDER,' working 'CORRUPTION OF BLOOD;' and every State, as well as\r\nCongress itself, was and is positively prohibited by the Constitution\r\nfrom passing any such bill or law; and should we ever succeed in having\r\nany but a pro-slavery, slave-catching Supreme Court, all these laws will\r\nbe annulled by their own most positive unconstitutionally. True, there\r\nwere slaves at the time the Constitution was adopted, but all then\r\nliving are now dead; and but for this doctrine of 'State rights,' there\r\nnever would have been any State law making the child of a slave mother\r\nalso a slave; but for this doctrine no such bill of attainder would have\r\nbeen passed, or if passed, it never could have been enforced; and we\r\nshould not to-day be listening to the cries of four millions of slaves,\r\nnor have the homes of thousands of honest citizens made desolate by the\r\nabsence of loved ones. But for this terrible doctrine, 'the click of\r\nhammers closing rivets up,' would not now be giving 'dreadful note of\r\npreparation.' But for this heresy, subversive of all law, of all order,\r\nof all nationality, we should not to-day be at war for our existence.\r\nBut for this doctrine, and the right claimed by some of the States to\r\nextend their 'bills of attainder,' working corruption of blood over the\r\nentire Union, we should not have our homes filled with grief and our\r\nstreets covered with the funeral pageants of brave men killed in defense\r\nof the Union. We want no more evidence of the accursed nature of the\r\ndoctrine of 'State rights.' We are a UNION--a NATION. We must have\r\nNATIONAL LAWS, NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, NATIONAL FREEDOM. We have had too\r\nmuch of State law, too much of State rights, too much of State slavery.\r\nThe NATION MUST BE SUPREME. The States must be subordinate. As we uphold\r\nand perpetuate the National authority, so will be our existence as a\r\npeople. As we detract from this, so will be our weakness and downfall.\r\n\r\nGOD PRESERVE THE NATION!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nROANOKE ISLAND.\r\n\r\nTHE SITE OF THE FIRST ENGLISH COLONY IN AMERICA.\r\n\r\n    'I know that historians do borrow of poets, not only much of their\r\n    ornament but somewhat of their substance.'--_Raleigh's History of\r\n    the World._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name of Roanoke Island awakens in the mind of every lover of\r\nAmerican history, sentiments of veneration and respect. It carries us\r\nback to the days of England's great Queen, to ruffs and rapiers, and\r\ncalls up the memories of the gallant but unfortunate Raleigh, and of the\r\nbrave knights, Grenville, Lane, and White, men who made their mark in\r\nhistory even in that golden era of chivalry and enterprise.\r\n\r\nLet us go back through the vista of nearly three centuries, and trace\r\nthe history of this spot where our language was first spoken and written\r\non this continent. When we recall the first occupation of this island by\r\nthe English, and picture to ourselves the Indians in their normal state,\r\nwith their dress, habitations, and implements, so picturesque and\r\nunique, as well as the gallant gentlemen in the costume of that\r\npicturesque age, it seems almost to border on romance. But there is a\r\ndark side to the picture. The sombre veil of uncertainty hangs over the\r\nfate of two entire colonies, which, if lifted, would consecrate this\r\nspot to the extremes of suffering and bloodshed. It was, no doubt,\r\nbetter to have these scenes buried in oblivion, and for each succeeding\r\nhistorian to fill up this chapter with his own fancies, than to be able\r\nto give the minute details of long days and months of probable famine,\r\npestilence, war, captivity, and torture, which have occurred here or in\r\nthe immediate vicinity. The certain knowledge of them would have\r\nawakened in their countrymen sentiments of retaliation and vengeance,\r\nand a fearful retribution would have been meted but to the natives, and\r\nhave fallen upon the innocent as well as the guilty.\r\n\r\nIt was not until about the commencement of the sixteenth century that\r\nEngland could be considered one of the great maritime powers in Europe.\r\nAlthough Henry the Seventh had authorized Cabot to prosecute a voyage of\r\ndiscovery as early as 1497, in which he discovered the continent, thus\r\nactually anticipating Columbus, who did not discover it till the\r\nsucceeding year, no real attempts at colonization took place until a\r\ncentury afterward. In 1578, Sir Humphrey Gilbert obtained a patent from\r\nQueen Elizabeth to colonize such parts of North-America as were not then\r\noccupied by any of her allies. Soon after, he, assisted and accompanied\r\nby his step-brother, Sir Walter Raleigh, fitted out an expedition and\r\nsailed for America; but they were intercepted by a Spanish fleet, and\r\nreturned unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nIn 1583, they equipped a new squadron, in which Raleigh did not embark.\r\nThis enterprise failed, and Sir Humphrey perished at sea. Still Raleigh\r\nwas not disheartened. He had been a soldier in the religious war then\r\nraging in France, and associated with the Protestant admiral, Coligny,\r\nand many of his officers, whose ill-fated colony met so bloody a fate\r\nnear the river St. John. Doubtless, during his intercourse with these\r\nmen, their experience in Florida often became the theme of discourse,\r\nand it may be that from it he imbibed that passion for discovery and\r\ncolonization in America, which ended only with his life. He doubtless\r\nlearned of the voyage of Verranzo, who, in the employ of France, had, in\r\n1524, coasted from Cape Fear to Rhode Island; but still our shores were\r\nhardly more than a myth, and the country north of the peninsula of\r\nFlorida a _terra incognita_. Early in 1584, Raleigh, then a gallant\r\ncourtier, received a grant from Elizabeth to 'discover and find out such\r\nremote and heathen lands, not actually possessed or inhabited by any\r\nChristian King, or his subjects, and there to have, hold, fortify, and\r\npossess, in fee-simple to him and his associates and their heirs\r\nforever, with privileges of allegiance to the crown of all that might\r\nthere reside; they and their descendants.'\r\n\r\nThis grant would apply to any portion of the globe not claimed or\r\ninhabited by the subjects of a Christian prince. The grant bears date\r\nMarch 25th, in the twenty-sixth year of the reign of Queen Elizabeth,\r\n1584. Raleigh anticipated its passing the great seal, and probably had\r\nfor some months been making preparations for a voyage of discovery under\r\nthis patent. So energetic was he, that two barks were prepared and\r\ndispatched from the west of England on the 27th of April. They were\r\nunder the commands of Captains Amidas and Barlow, with Simeon Fernando\r\nas pilot, who, it may be presumed from the name, was a Spaniard, and no\r\ndoubt had been on this coast before. They took the route by way of the\r\nCanaries and West-India Islands, and by the tenth of May had reached the\r\nformer, and by the tenth of June the latter, where they staid twelve\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nContinuing their voyage, on the second of July they found shoal water,\r\nwhere they say[K]: 'We smelled so sweet and strange a smell, as if we\r\nhad been in the midst of a delicate garden, abounding with all kinds of\r\nodoriferous herbs and flowers, so we were assured that the land could\r\nnot be far distant; and keeping good watch, and bearing but slack sail,\r\nthe fourth of the same month we arrived upon the coast, which we\r\nsupposed to be a continent, and firm land; and we sailed along the same\r\na hundred and twenty miles, before we could find any entrance or river\r\nissuing into the sea.'\r\n\r\nThey entered the first inlet which appeared, 'but not without\r\ndifficulty, and anchored on the left-hand side.' Subsequent historians\r\nhave written much to settle the long-disputed question, by what channel\r\nor inlet the earliest English navigators entered. After a careful\r\nexamination of the early and of later authorities, and with some\r\npractical acquaintance with the localities, I am of the opinion that\r\nthey must have entered by what is now known as Hatteras Inlet. 'The\r\nisland twenty miles long and not over six miles broad,' was that part\r\nof the banks or shore between this inlet and that now known as Ocracoke.\r\n\r\nSo soon as they had given thanks to God for their safe arrival, they\r\nlanded, and took possession in 'the right of the Queen's most excellent\r\nmajesty,' and afterward delivered it over to the use of the grantee.\r\nThey found the land sandy and low, and expressed their admiration of the\r\nabundance of wild grapes, as well as the pines and cedars; but saw no\r\ninhabitants. The third day, they espied a small boat, with three\r\npersons, who came to the shore. There they were met by the two captains\r\nand the pilot, and one of the natives boldly commenced a conversation\r\nentirely unintelligible to the Englishmen, but most friendly in its\r\ntones. Having received a shirt and hat, the Indian, after viewing the\r\nvessels, fell to fishing, and in less than half an hour loaded his boat\r\nas deep as she could swim with fishes, which he soon landed on the shore\r\nand divided between the ship and pinnace. The next day, there came\r\ndivers boats, containing forty or fifty natives, 'a very handsome and\r\ngoodly people, and in their behavior and manners as civil as any in\r\nEurope.' Among them was the king's brother, 'Grangamimeo,' who said the\r\nking was called Winginia. They commenced trading with the Indians, no\r\ndoubt greatly to their own advantage. The natives were, of course, much\r\nastonished at the splendor and profusion of the articles offered; but of\r\nall things which he saw, a bright tin dish most pleased Grangamimeo. He\r\nclapped it on his breast, and after drilling a hole in the brim, hung it\r\nabout his neck, making signs that it would defend him from his enemies.\r\nThis tin dish was exchanged for twenty deerskins, worth twenty crowns,\r\nand a copper kettle for fifty skins. In a few days, they were visited by\r\nthe king and his family. The women had bracelets of pearl and ornaments\r\nof copper; the pearl was probably nothing but pieces of shell, and the\r\ncopper must have been obtained from near Lake Superior, where the mines\r\nhad been worked ages before the advent of the white man. The Indians\r\ntold them of a ship that had been wrecked near there twenty-six years\r\npreviously, and that the crew attempted to escape in their boat, but\r\nprobably perished, as the boat was afterward found on another island.\r\nThis story has usually been looked upon with doubt; but recent\r\nresearches in the Spanish archives have shown that they had a fort and\r\ncolony at Port Royal in 1557, and about the same period, another in the\r\nChesapeake. There can be but little doubt that the story was true, and\r\nthat the ship contained Spaniards passing between these two places. They\r\nalso told curious stories of a great river 'Cipo,' where pearl was\r\nobtained, which has puzzled later historians to locate; but we now know\r\nthat _Cipo_ or _Sepo_, in the Algonquin language, which was spoken from\r\nMaine to about this point, means simply a river, and probably referred\r\nto either the Moratio, now called the Roanoke, or to the Chowan.\r\n\r\nThese narratives give a glowing account of the natives and of their\r\nability to construct their houses and canoes and weirs for fish. As this\r\nwas their first intercourse with Europeans, it undoubtedly shows what\r\ntheir true condition was and had been for centuries. Situated, as this\r\nterritory is, under a mild climate, where corn, beans, and melons can be\r\nso easily raised, and having a great abundance of game and fish, it must\r\nhave been a paradise for the Indians. Of the king's brother, it is said:\r\n\r\n    'He was very just of his promise; for many times we delivered him\r\n    merchandise upon his word, but ever he came within the day and\r\n    performed his promise. He sent us every day a brace or two of fat\r\n    bucks, conies, hares, and fish, the best in the world. He sent us\r\n    divers kinds of fruits, melons, walnuts, cucumbers, gourds, peas,\r\n    and divers roots and fruits, very excellent and good; and of their\r\n    country corn, which is very white, fair, and well-tasted, and\r\n    grows three times in five months. In May, they sow; in July, they\r\n    reap: in June, they sow; in August, they reap: in July, they sow;\r\n    in September, they reap. They cast the corn into the ground,\r\n    breaking a little of the soft turf with a wooden mattock.\r\n    Ourselves proved the soil, and put some of our peas into the\r\n    ground, and in ten days they were fourteen inches high. They have\r\n    also beans, very fair, of divers colors, and wonderful plenty;\r\n    some growing naturally and some in their gardens.'\r\n\r\nTheir advent to Roanoke Island is thus described:\r\n\r\n    'After they had been divers times aboard our vessels, myself with\r\n    seven others went twenty miles into the river that runs toward the\r\n    city of Skicoak, which river they call Occum, and the evening\r\n    following, we came to an island which they call Roanoke, distant\r\n    from the harbor by which we entered seven leagues. At the north\r\n    end thereof was a village of nine houses, built of cedar and\r\n    fortified round about with sharp trees, to keep out their enemies;\r\n    and the entrance into it made like a turnpike, very artificially.\r\n    When we came toward it, standing near unto the water side, the\r\n    wife of Grangamimeo, the king's brother, came running out to meet\r\n    us very cheerfully and friendly; her husband was not then in the\r\n    village. Some of her people she commanded to draw our boat on\r\n    shore; others she appointed to carry us on their backs to the dry\r\n    ground, and others to bring our oars into the house, for fear of\r\n    stealing. When we were come to the outer room, having five rooms\r\n    in her house, she caused us to sit down by a great fire, and\r\n    afterward took off our clothes and washed them and dried them\r\n    again. Some of the women washed our feet in warm water, and she\r\n    took great pains to see all things ordered in the best manner,\r\n    making great haste to dress some meat for us to eat. After we had\r\n    dried ourselves, she brought us into the inner room, when she sat\r\n    on the board standing alongside the house, and placed before us\r\n    some wheat fermented, sodden venison, and fish, sodden, boiled,\r\n    and roasted, melons, raw and sodden, roots of divers kinds, and\r\n    fruits. We were entertained with all love and kindness, and with\r\n    as much bounty as we could possibly desire. We found these people\r\n    most gentle, loving, and faithful; void of all guile and treason,\r\n    and such as live after the manner of the golden age.'\r\n\r\n    'Beyond this island, called Roanoke, a main stands, very plentiful\r\n    in fruits and other natural increase, together with many towns and\r\n    villages alongside the continent, some bordering upon the islands,\r\n    and some standing further into the land.'\r\n\r\n    'When we first had sight of this country, some thought the first\r\n    land we saw to be a continent; but after we entered into the\r\n    haven, we saw before us another mighty long sea, for there lieth\r\n    along the coast a tract of island two hundred miles in extent.'\r\n\r\nThus they picture the country with the rosy tint so natural to all\r\ndiscoverers. They speak of the island as being sixteen miles long, which\r\nrecent surveys show nearly correct. Many of the trees, animals, and fish\r\nwere new to them, and like all travelers, they did not neglect to give a\r\nfair embellishment in their report to Raleigh. Their stay in the country\r\nwas brief, less than sixty days, and on their return, they carried with\r\nthem two of the Indians, named Wanchese and Mantco, who were regarded as\r\na great curiosity by the English. They were exhibited at London to\r\nthousands, and gave Raleigh great satisfaction, as they were the first\r\nnatives of America who had visited England.\r\n\r\nThe return of Amidas and Barlow, with their flattering report of the\r\ndiscovery and beauty of Virginia, created great excitement throughout\r\nEngland, and with it a desire to visit the new land. The soldiers of\r\nfortune, of which that reign was fruitful, were ready to embark in any\r\ncause that promised wealth or fame; and the nobility and merchants, with\r\nsanguine views of trade and extensive domains containing the precious\r\nmetals, were ready to furnish the means to transport a colony to the new\r\nEl Dorado. It was not difficult to procure men, under such dazzling\r\naspects; a sufficient number was soon enrolled, but the material was not\r\nof a kind to make a successful and permanent settlement. Disbanded\r\nsoldiers from foreign service, and London tradesmen out of business, and\r\nenlisting only with the hope of soon obtaining wealth, and returning\r\nhome to enjoy it, were not the men to clear away forests, cultivate the\r\nsoil, or develop industry, the only true source for success in America.\r\nThe fleet consisted of seven vessels, the 'Tiger' and 'Roebuck,' each of\r\none hundred and forty tons; the 'Lion,' of one hundred; and the\r\n'Elizabeth,' of fifty tons; with a small bark and two pinnaces, which\r\nwere without decks.\r\n\r\nIn this fleet were several, eminent among the gallant men who have\r\ncontributed so much to render the reign of the Virgin Queen illustrious\r\nin history. The commander, Sir Richard Grenville, distinguished himself\r\nat the battle of Lepanto, and afterward lost his life in a desperate\r\nencounter with a Spanish fleet off the Azores. He was a cousin of\r\nRaleigh, and always his friend. The next in real rank was Ralph Lane, to\r\nwhom was delegated the office of governor, and of whom we shall speak\r\nhereafter. Thomas Cavendish commanded one of the vessels. He was a\r\nwealthy and dashing adventurer, who, after his return, fitted out an\r\nexpedition and captured some Spanish ships with great treasure; but\r\nafter a reckless life, he found an early grave. Lewis Stukely, another\r\ncousin of Raleigh, had some prominent station. He proved a base\r\ncharacter, and assisted, by his intrigues, in bringing his patron to the\r\nblock. Amidas, who was in the first voyage, also found place here, with\r\nthe title of 'admiral.' Simeon Fernando, the former pilot, was now in\r\ncommand of the 'Tiger.'\r\n\r\nThe fleet sailed from Plymouth on the ninth of April, 1585, and made one\r\nof the West-India Islands, where they had many adventures, on the\r\nfourteenth of May. Thence proceeding on their voyage, they reached the\r\ncoast of Florida on the twentieth of June; on the twenty-third, they\r\nbarely escaped wreck on Cape Fear shoals; and on the twenty-sixth\r\nanchored at Wocokon, now known as Ocracoke. Three days afterward, in\r\nattempting to cross the bar, the 'Tiger' struck, and remained for some\r\ntime; the first of many similar accidents on that wild and dangerous\r\nspot. On the third of July, they sent word of their arrival to Winginia,\r\nthe Indian king at Roanoke; and the same day dispatched Captain Arundell\r\nacross the sound to the main land, where he found two men who had\r\narrived twenty days before, in one of the smaller vessels. For the next\r\nten days, they were engaged in visiting the Indian towns on the main.\r\nHere one of the Indians stole a silver cup. To recover it, a party\r\nvisited a town, and not obtaining the cup, burned the houses and spoiled\r\nthe corn; 'a mean revenge,' destined to meet a bloody retaliation.\r\n\r\nSoon after, the fleet sailed to Hatorask; not the cape or the inlet\r\nwhich we now call by nearly the same name, but an inlet then nearly\r\nopposite Roanoke, where all those intending to remain were probably\r\nlanded. On the twenty-fifth of August, the fleet sailed for England.\r\n\r\nThe colony, landed on Roanoke, consisted of one hundred and seven\r\npersons, of whom Ralph Lane was the Governor, Amidas, the admiral,\r\nHariot, the historian and chaplain, and John White the artist. So soon\r\nas they were settled at the island, they began the exploration of the\r\ncountry. This was done in boats, and entirely toward the south. Visiting\r\nthe Neuse and the western shore of Pamlico Sound, they explored\r\nCurrituck, on the east; while on the north, they penetrated to the\r\ndistance of one hundred and sixty miles, and ascended Moratio, now known\r\nas the Roanoke river, probably more than fifty miles from its mouth.\r\nThis was done with extreme labor and peril, as the Indians had deluded\r\nthem with a story of mines of gold, and having notice of Lane's coming,\r\nwere prepared to attack him. So sanguine were the party of finding\r\nmines, and yet so reduced, that they still pushed on, though they once\r\nfound that they had but a half-pint of corn for a man, besides two\r\nmastiffs, upon the pottage of which, with sassafras leaves, they might\r\nsubsist for two days. They returned safe, however, without any of the\r\nprecious metals which they had made such exertions to find. Lane also\r\nexplored the Chowan, or, as he called it, the Chowanook. The king of\r\nthis country gave him much information respecting the territory, which\r\nproved to be perfectly truthful.\r\n\r\nFrom the Indians, Lane had received intimations of the existence of\r\nChesapeake Bay,[L] and was desirous of visiting it.\r\n\r\nThe story of this 'king' of the Chesapeans was full of interest, he\r\nknowing well the route, which Lane communicates, with the plans he\r\nintended to carry out, but which the sudden departure of the colony left\r\nunfulfilled, so that the great bay remained for a few years longer a\r\nmere myth to the English. Of this native king, Lane says:\r\n\r\n    'He is called Menatonon, a man impotent in his limbs, but\r\n    otherwise, for a savage, a very grave and wise man, and of a very\r\n    singular good discourse in matters concerning the state, not only\r\n    in his own country, and the disposition of his own men, but also\r\n    of his neighbors round about him, as well far as near, and of the\r\n    commodities that each country yielded. When I had him prisoner\r\n    with me for two days that we were together, he gave me more\r\n    understanding and light of the country than I have received by all\r\n    the searches and savages that I or any of my company have had\r\n    conference with.' 'He told me that by going three days' journey up\r\n    the Chowanook, (Chowan,) you are within four days' journey over\r\n    land north-east to a certain king's country, which lays upon the\r\n    sea; but his greatest place of strength is an island,[M] as he\r\n    described to me, in a bay, the water round about it very deep.\r\n\r\n    ... He also signified to me that this king had so great a quantity\r\n    of pearl as that not only his own skins that he wears and his\r\n    gentlemen and followers are full set with the pearl, but also his\r\n    beds and houses are garnished with them.' 'He showed me certain\r\n    pearl the said king brought him two years before, but of the worst\r\n    sort. He gave me a rope of the same pearl,[N] but they were black\r\n    and nought;--many of them were very large, etc. It seemed to me\r\n    that the said king had traffic with white men that had clothes as\r\n    we have.' ... 'The king of Chowanook promised to give me guides to\r\n    go into that king's country, but he advised me to take good store\r\n    of men and victual with me.' ... 'And I had resolved, had supplies\r\n    have come in a reasonable time, to have undertaken it.'\r\n\r\nHe goes on to state that he would have sent two small pinnaces to the\r\nnorthward, to have discovered the bay he speaks of, while he, with all\r\nthe small boats and two hundred men, would have gone up the Chowanook\r\nwith the guides, whom he would have kept in manacles, to the head of the\r\nriver, where he would have left his boats, and raised a small trench\r\nwith a palisado on it, and left thirty men to guard the boats and\r\nstores. Then he would have marched two days' journey, and raised another\r\n'sconce,' or small fort, and left fifteen or twenty men near a\r\ncorn-field, so that they might live on that. Then, in two days more, he\r\nwould have reached the bay, where he would have built his main fort, and\r\nremoved his colony.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting, at this time, to see how Lane would, with the caution\r\nand boldness of a good soldier, have passed up the broad estuary of the\r\nChowan to 'where it groweth to be as narrow as the Thames between\r\nLambeth and Westminster,' and so on, and turning into the Blackwater,\r\nwhich he would have navigated probably to where it is now crossed by the\r\nrailroad, he would have been within fifty or sixty miles of the bay.\r\nWhile we write, General Burnside is pursuing the same route, not to\r\ncapture from a savage tribe, but from a rebellious and traitorous\r\npeople, the same domain.\r\n\r\nThe same chief or king gave Lane a fanciful account of the Moratio\r\nriver, which we now call the Roanoke. He says:\r\n\r\n    'This river opens into the broad sound of Weapomeiok, (Albemarle,)\r\n    and the other rivers and sounds show no current, but in calm\r\n    weather are moved by the wind. This river of Moratio has so swift\r\n    a current from the West, that I thought it would with oars scarce\r\n    be navigable; the current runs as strong as at London bridge. The\r\n    savages do report strange things of the head of the river, which\r\n    was thirty days' voyage; that it springs out of a great rock, and\r\n    makes a most violent stream; and that this rock stands so near\r\n    unto the South Sea, that in storms the waves beat into the stream\r\n    and make it brackish.'\r\n\r\nThis river he afterward explored. But ere long, either from oppression\r\nor fear of the English, the Indians assumed a hostile attitude, and laid\r\nplans to surprise them. The English had to be continually on their\r\nguard, and in the mean time famine compelled them to leave Roanoke in\r\nlarge parties, to obtain subsistence from the corn-fields, or proceed\r\nalong the coast for shell-fish.\r\n\r\nAbout the first of June, 1586, Lane, with a party, left the island,\r\nproceeding across the sound, and by a stratagem, hardly authorized in an\r\nhonorable soldier, captured and killed the chief of the country and many\r\nof his people.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, he was on the look-out for ships from England, with\r\nsupplies, and had sent Captain Stafford, with a party, to 'Croatan,'\r\nprobably at or near what is now known as Cape Lookout, to discover their\r\napproach. Suddenly, he reported a great fleet of twenty sail in sight,\r\nwhich proved to be the squadron commanded by the celebrated Sir Francis\r\nDrake, who was returning from one of his expeditions among the Spanish\r\nsettlements in the West-Indies. When Drake left England, he was directed\r\nto look after Raleigh's colony, and had accordingly brought a letter to\r\nLane. He anchored his fleet opposite Roanoke, (probably just off 'Nagg's\r\nHead,' now celebrated as the scene of the temporary sojourn and flight\r\nof Governor Wise,) and supplied them with the needed provisions. He also\r\nmade them an offer of one of his small vessels, which they very gladly\r\naccepted.\r\n\r\nBut a storm, which continued for many days, came upon them; the promised\r\nbark was driven to sea; the open roadstead, where the larger ships were\r\ncompelled to anchor, made Roanoke an undesirable location, and as the\r\ntime had long expired when the promised reinforcements should have\r\narrived from England, this disappointment, together with the hostilities\r\nof the Indians, so discouraged the leaders of the colony, that they\r\nsolicited and obtained from Drake a passage to England. On the\r\nnineteenth of June, after a little less than a year's residence in the\r\nnew land, they all sailed for home, and Roanoke Island was left in\r\nsolitude.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat singular that with all the wars, famine, and privations\r\nof these adventurers, not a solitary death occurred during the time they\r\nspent here.\r\n\r\nIt certainly speaks much for the salubrity of the climate, as well as\r\nfor the care of the officers who were in command. They all arrived\r\nsafely in England, about the last of July.[O]\r\n\r\n[Foonote O: After Lane returned home, he obtained some celebrity as a\r\nsoldier, in various wars, and was knighted. His narrative, addressed to\r\nRaleigh, as printed in Hakluyt, would prove him possessed of much\r\nenergy. As the first Governor of an American colony, his name has been\r\nkept in remembrance. Had the supply-ship arrived but a few weeks sooner,\r\nhe might have remained, and his colony have been the progenitors of the\r\nEnglish race on this continent.]\r\n\r\nAmong the eminent men who accompanied Lane, and passed nearly a year at\r\nRoanoke, was Thomas Hariot, an Oxford scholar and a celebrated\r\nmathematician. He went out in the expedition as historian and\r\nnaturalist, to make a topographical and scientific survey and report of\r\nthe country and its commodities, duties fulfilled by him in the most\r\nfaithful manner. His report was published in London, in 1588, under the\r\ntitle of _A Brief and True Report of the New-found Land in Virginia, of\r\nthe Commodities found there, etc._ It was, in 1590, put into Latin, and\r\npublished by Theodore de Bry, at Frankfort, with about thirty curious\r\nengravings, from the designs of John White, the artist who accompanied\r\nthe expedition. These pictures are exceedingly well executed, by eminent\r\nDutch artists, and a number of them give undoubtedly the exact portraits\r\nof many of the principal Indians, with their costumes and habits, as\r\nthey were before they were changed by intercourse with the Europeans,\r\nshowing us their original condition.\r\n\r\nThe Aborigines were certainly further advanced in agriculture and\r\ncivilization than has been generally supposed, and probably much more\r\nthan the tribes who resided further north. To all who are curious in the\r\nhistory of the early inhabitants of North-America, this work will be\r\nfound of extraordinary interest. It may be observed that the maps of the\r\ncoast which it contains are remarkably correct, and at the same time\r\nindicate many important changes to have since occurred. But its greatest\r\nvalue is its description of the 'commodities' or valuable productions,\r\nof daily use and commercial value, which were found here. Thus, under\r\nthe Indian name of _Uppowoc_, Hariot gives a description of the\r\ntobacco-plant,[O] which had been previously known to the Spaniards.\r\nThis, however, seems to have been its earliest introduction to the\r\nEnglish, and it was carried home by them 'to the nobility.' In the\r\naccount of this plant, we are told that it is so esteemed by the Indians\r\nthat they even think their gods are delighted with it. Our chronicler\r\nfurther says: 'We were in the habit of using this plant for our\r\ndiseases, as the natives did, and have continued the practice since our\r\nreturn.' It was only used to smoke; the natives were never guilty of\r\nchewing it.' Among the roots, it mentions _Openauk_, which must have\r\nbeen what we call the pea-nut, which is now largely cultivated along\r\nthat coast, and is quite an article of commerce. They also found here\r\nthe sweet potato and various kinds of squashes and melons, as well as\r\nmany varieties of beans, some of which are still cultivated extensively\r\nin that region.\r\n\r\nIt also describes a root which grows sometimes as large as a human head;\r\nthis must have been what is now known as the _tanger_. But the greatest\r\ndiscovery of all was the potato, which has been of such inestimable\r\nbenefit to mankind. This, which they carried home, was cultivated by\r\nRaleigh, on his estate in Ireland, and thence disseminated through\r\nEurope. Doubt has been thrown over this statement by the fact that\r\nbotanists have been unable to find this plant in North-America in an\r\nindigenous state, and so have concluded that it never grew here at all.\r\nOur volume, however, proves that it was cultivated by the natives, as\r\nwere corn, beans, and tobacco. Of it, Hariot speaks as follows:\r\n\r\n    '_Kaishuopenauk_ is a kind of white root of the size of a hen's\r\n    egg, and almost similar in form; it did not seem to be of a very\r\n    pleasant taste, and consequently we did not take any particular\r\n    pains to learn its history, yet the natives cook and eat them.'\r\n\r\nScarcely any part of our country has a greater variety of plants and\r\ntrees than this vicinity. It will be found an interesting field for\r\nbotanists.\r\n\r\nOnly a few days had elapsed after the departure of the colonists, when a\r\nship, prepared and furnished with supplies from Raleigh, arrived at\r\nRoanoke. After some days spent by her commander in searching for his\r\ncountrymen, he set sail for home. Fifteen days after the departure of\r\nthis supply-ship, three vessels, under the command of Sir Richard\r\nGrenville, made their appearance before the place, and when he\r\nascertained the state of affairs, his disappointment was extreme. He,\r\nhowever, made extensive explorations, and leaving fifteen men to reside\r\nat Roanoke and keep possession of the country, departed for home. One\r\nwould suppose that Raleigh, by this time, would have become disheartened\r\nby his disappointments in America; but he was now at the hight of his\r\nprosperity, and seemed never to despair of the final success of this his\r\nfavorite project. The following year, 1587, a new expedition was fitted\r\nout under the charge of John White, as Governor, with twelve assistants.\r\nThey were to found the city of Raleigh, in Virginia. This fleet of three\r\nships left Plymouth on the fifth of May, and after making a short stay\r\nat the West-India Islands, sailed for our coast, reaching it on the\r\nsixteenth of July. They a second time barely escaped a wreck on Cape\r\nFear shoals, but anchored safely at Hatorask, on the twenty-seventh of\r\nthe same month. They had been directed by Raleigh to visit Roanoke, and\r\nthen proceed to the Chesapeake and there land the colony which they had\r\ntransported. The Governor and party landed on Roanoke Island, and\r\nproceeded to the place (probably on the side next the sea) where Sir\r\nRichard Grenville left fifteen men the year previous. They found,\r\nhowever, only the skeleton of one, who with his companions had probably\r\nbeen slain by the savages. The next day they repaired to the south end\r\nof the island, where Lane had built his fort and houses. No human being\r\nwas to be seen, and thus the fate of the fifteen was confirmed.\r\n\r\nThe commander of this fleet was Simeon Fernando, a prominent officer in\r\nthe two previous expeditions, who no doubt had given satisfaction to\r\nLane, for his name was given to the fort at Roanoke. But the chronicles,\r\nin this instance, have charged him with treachery, he having refused to\r\nproceed to the Chesapeake. In consequence of this refusal, the colony\r\nremained here, occupying the buildings erected by Lane. The Indians soon\r\ngave proof of hostility by attacking and murdering one of the\r\nassistants. Master Stafford, who had previously been with Lane,\r\naccompanied by the Indian Manteo, (who came with them from England,)\r\nwith twenty others, passed over to the mainland, and renewed their\r\nformer intercourse with the Indians. The natives claimed to be friendly,\r\nand related how the fifteen were murdered by the tribe that once\r\ninhabited Roanoke. This party again visited the mainland on the ninth of\r\nAugust, and falling in with a party of natives, whom they supposed to be\r\nhostile, attacked and killed a number, but subsequently learned that\r\nthey were of a friendly tribe. On the thirteenth of August Manteo was\r\nchristened and announced as Lord of Roanoke, in reward for his faithful\r\nservice. How far he understood the meaning or value of the rite, we are\r\nunable to state; but the tendency of the act to influence the natives to\r\nregard the Europeans with more favor, can be readily implied.\r\n\r\nThe first child of English blood born upon this continent, (August\r\n18th,) was 'Virginia' Dare, a granddaughter of the Governor. At the\r\nexpiration of the time when the ships were to return home, it was\r\nthought advisable to send one of the principal men with them to make\r\nsure that supplies should be forwarded by their friends; but so\r\nsatisfied were the majority with their present prospects, that it was a\r\ndifficult matter to find one willing to go. At the last moment, finding\r\nall else so reluctant to leave, the Governor, John White, decided to\r\nreturn in person, and sailed, in company with the returning ships, on\r\nthe twenty-fifth of August, leaving at Roanoke one hundred and seventeen\r\npersons to an unknown fate. He, with his vessel and her consorts,\r\narrived safely in England.\r\n\r\nThe ship in which the Governor embarked, reached England in November,\r\n1587. The succeeding year was, perhaps, as trying for that country as\r\nany it had ever experienced, the fear of the Spanish invasion and its\r\nconsequences, being the absorbing theme of public attention. No doubt\r\nWhite had in view the best interests of his colony; he knew the\r\ncondition of the colonists, and that their prosperity and perhaps their\r\nlives depended on his reinforcing them. But the war was imperative, and\r\ndemanded the services of all. Raleigh, Lane, and White had important\r\npositions assigned them, and all gained a reputation for valor. It was\r\nnot, therefore, till two years later, that White was able to embark for\r\nthe colony, and then without either men or provisions; as he expresses\r\nit, 'with only myself and my chest.'\r\n\r\nThe ships put to sea on the twentieth of March, and lingered among the\r\nWest-India Islands till the last of July, when, proceeding on their\r\nvoyage, they anchored off old Hatorask Inlet on the fifteenth of August.\r\nHere they descried a great smoke issuing from Roanoke, which gave White\r\ngreat hopes of meeting the friends he had left three years before. The\r\nparty landed with much difficulty, explored the island, and found that\r\nthe smoke proceeded from the burning of grass and dead trees. Footprints\r\nof savages were seen in the sand, but to the sound of their voices and\r\ntheir trumpet-calls there was no response.\r\n\r\nCircumnavigating the island, they went to the north end, where a colony\r\nhad been left, and where they saw letters cut in the bark of a tree,\r\nindicating that the settlers had gone to Croatan, (Cape Lookout.)\r\n\r\nThey found the fort deserted and dilapidated, and within it, guns, bars\r\nof iron, and lead, thrown on the ground, with weeds growing over them;\r\nand they afterward discovered buried in a trench, several chests, some\r\ncontaining property of White, and among it his own armor.\r\n\r\nHe was now anxious to proceed to Croatan, but a severe storm coming on\r\ncompelled the ships, after losing men and anchors, to put to sea. As it\r\ncontinued, they bore away for home, leaving Roanoke to solitude.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the colony found the Indians hostile, and despairing\r\nof relief from home, abandoned the island and proceeded to Croatan,\r\nwhere they ultimately perished. However, a writer who resided in the\r\ncountry more than a century after, says there were traditions among a\r\ntribe that inhabited the coast, that their ancestors were white people,\r\nand could talk in a book, and many of the children had gray eyes, which\r\nare never seen among natives of pure blood.\r\n\r\nRaleigh is said to have sent three several times to ascertain their\r\nfate, but without any success. In some of the memoirs of the later\r\nVirginia settlements, which have recently been printed, there are\r\nreferences to persons said to have been recovered from Raleigh's colony\r\non Roanoke, but they are indirect, and only show that tradition was busy\r\nwith their fate. There can be no doubt every soul perished on this\r\nisolated coast.\r\n\r\nThe ancient history of Roanoke closed with the departure of Raleigh's\r\nlast ship, and the natives resumed possession of their favorite spots.\r\n\r\nThe Chesapeake was entered, and Jamestown settled, in 1607; and although\r\nthe bold explorer of the bay and rivers, Captain John Smith, was\r\ndesirous of sending a party to look after the lost colony, it was never\r\ndone. Years passed away, and the grant of Carolina embraced all the\r\ncountry once claimed and occupied by Raleigh and his colonists.\r\n\r\nIn 1653, an adventurer from Virginia, with a small craft, entered\r\nCurrituck Inlet and visited Roanoke. Here he found residing a great\r\nIndian chief, with whom he made a treaty of peace and alliance, which\r\nled to a purchase of land and to a long intimacy. A house for the chief\r\nwas built like the English dwellings, and his son was confided to the\r\nEnglish to be educated. The young chief embraced Christianity, and was\r\nbaptized.\r\n\r\nAt this time the ruins of Lane's fort were plainly visible, and the\r\nnatives were familiar with its history.\r\n\r\nThe first permanent settlement in what is now North-Carolina, can not be\r\ntraced to an earlier date than 1656. It was on the shores of Albermarle\r\nSound, some forty miles from Roanoke.\r\n\r\nAlmost coëval with this came small vessels from New-England, to trade,\r\nfirst for furs and peltry, and soon after to exchange their own\r\nproductions and those of the West-Indies for the tobacco, corn, naval\r\nstores, and lumber of the country; and for the succeeding century our\r\npeople were almost entirely the merchants and carriers of all this\r\nregion. As a consequence some of them permanently settled here, and many\r\nof the merchants of Boston held extensive tracts of land obtained by\r\ngrants or purchase.\r\n\r\nOur public records contain many references to these, and among others we\r\nfind a grant of the Island of Roanoke, as early as 1676, to Joshua Lamb,\r\nof New-England. It would seem that it was then settled, and had houses\r\nand buildings,[P] and probably had been occupied for many years, and\r\nperhaps antedated the settlements before referred to, thus making it the\r\nfirst place permanently settled in North-Carolina.\r\n\r\nIn 1785, more than a century after, the following appears in the\r\ninventory of the estate of a resident of Boston:\r\n\r\n'In the State of North Carolina--one half of Roanoke Island, valued at\r\n£184 6s. 8d.'\r\n\r\nLawson, the very truthful historian of this country, who wrote about\r\n1700, says:\r\n\r\n    'A settlement had been begun on that part of Roanoke Island, where\r\n    the ruins of a fort are to be seen this day, as well as some old\r\n    English coins, which have been lately found, and a brass gun, and\r\n    a powder-horn, and one small quarter-deck gun, made of iron\r\n    staves, hooped with the same material, which method of making guns\r\n    might probably be used in those days for infant colonies.'\r\n\r\nIn time, the settlers extended over the Island, and slowly and quietly\r\npartially cultivated it. They were from the humblest class. Slavery,\r\nwith its consequences, never came here, and the small farms were\r\n'worked' by their owners and their sons.\r\n\r\nMany years ago the writer visited Roanoke. It was then, to a great\r\nextent, covered with its original growth of pines and oaks; the whole\r\npopulation, being only three or four hundred, a simple, industrious\r\ncommunity, who alternated their agricultural labors with fishing in the\r\nadjacent waters, and sometimes navigating their small vessels to\r\nneighboring ports. He then visited the site of Lane's fort, the present\r\nremains of which are very slight, being merely the wreck of an\r\nembankment. This has at times been excavated by parties who hoped to\r\nfind some deposit which would repay the trouble, but with little\r\nsuccess, a vial of quicksilver being the only relic said to have been\r\nfound. This article was doubtless to be used in discovering deposits of\r\nthe precious metals by the old adventurers. While walking through the\r\nlonely forests the mind of the visitor is involuntarily carried back to\r\nthe scenes that took place there, as well as to the actors who centuries\r\nago passed away. Now silence broods over the place once so active with\r\nlife, and nothing but nature remains, while the distant surf is ever\r\nsounding an everlasting requiem to the memory of the brave colonists.\r\n\r\nIf this brief history had been penned a year ago, the task would have\r\nended here; but Roanoke has now another chapter to add to the annals of\r\nour country. The great rebellion of 1861 had overshadowed the land, and\r\nits instigators were endeavoring to overthrow a Government whose power\r\nhad only been felt by them as the dew of heaven, and with as beneficent\r\nresults. The authority of Government was called into action, and Roanoke\r\nIsland once more felt the tread of armed men. Hatteras Inlet, now the\r\nprincipal entrance to these sounds, and well fortified by the\r\ninsurgents, was in August of 1861, captured by the Federal forces. The\r\nrebels then concentrated at Roanoke, which is the key to Albemarle\r\nSound, and an important military position. Here they assembled a large\r\nbody of troops and erected strong fortifications, deeming themselves\r\nsecure against any force that could be sent against them. General\r\nBurnside left the Chesapeake with a large fleet, and having succeeded in\r\npassing Hatteras Inlet and the bars which encircle it, sailed up the\r\nsound and came to anchor off the lower end of the Island on the sixth of\r\nFebruary, 1862.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the seventh the fleet under the command of Captain\r\nGoldsborough, attacked that of the enemy, and after a sharp cannonade,\r\nthe rebel vessels were, with one exception, captured or destroyed. As\r\nsoon as the naval action ceased, General Burnside landed his troops at\r\nthe lower part of the island, where they were forced to wade through mud\r\nand water; but nothing could retard the valor of these New-England\r\nsoldiers, who, pressing on toward the centre of the Island, carried the\r\nentrenchments and drove the enemy before them. The rebels retreated to\r\nthe northern end of the island and surrendered as prisoners of war, in\r\nnumber about twenty-five hundred men, with all their stores and\r\nimplements.\r\n\r\nThe fleet and army subsequently visited Edenton, Pascotank, the Chowan,\r\nNeuse, and Roanoke rivers, and planted the National flag over\r\nthem--visiting nearly the same shores so long ago explored by Lane and\r\nhis adventurers, and like him returning victorious to the headquarters\r\nat Roanoke Island.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA STORY OF MEXICAN LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\n'You are an unbelieving set of fellows, and though you admire my rings,\r\nmy breastpin, and my studs, and though you willingly accept any stray\r\ngems that I occasionally offer you, still you sneer and laugh at my\r\nmine; but it is no laughing matter, and now that we are all here\r\ntogether, I suppose I may as well gratify you by telling you all about\r\nit. However, as the yarn is a long one, I will first of all put the\r\ncigars and the wine within reach, so that you can help yourselves during\r\nthe recital.\r\n\r\n'Soon after our forces had evacuated Mexico, on my return from a long,\r\ntedious journey across the Cordilleras, I hired, what for the city of\r\nMexico, might be deemed sumptuous apartments, overlooking the Cathedral\r\nSquare; so luxurious, in fact, that my Mexican friends were lavish in\r\ntheir praises, though I confess my American visitors said much less. But\r\nmy domicil consisted of only two 'pieces,' one answering for both\r\nbedroom and parlor, while in the other I dressed. Never mind the latter,\r\nfor it contained little else than one shelf, which was adorned with a\r\nbrown earthen pitcher and a gourd cut in two, for all my washing. My\r\ndrawing-room, however, deserves a more elaborate description. The walls\r\nwere frescoed, in a peculiarly gorgeous style; garlands of flowers were\r\nrepresented as twining around piles of fruit, and it was hard to say\r\nwhether the profusion of the fruit, or the colors of the flowers, were\r\nthe severest tax on the imagination, though I always thought myself,\r\nthat they were both surpassed by incredible swarms of impossible\r\nhumming-birds, with very gold and silver wings. The floor was covered\r\nwith bran new matting, and the bedstead of cedar-wood was also new,\r\nthough the bullock-skin on which the mattress rested, had rather an\r\nantiquated air. Moreover, I _had_ a pair of sheets which were not of a\r\nbad color, although slightly patched. In addition, there was a Madonna\r\nhanging on one wall, and a Saint looking at her from the other; and\r\nagainst a door near the foot of my bed, stood a rocking-chair, which on\r\nmy conscience I believe must have been worth at least a dollar and a\r\nhalf. As the door was fastened up, this rocking-chair was the favorite\r\nresort of my first morning visitor, all subsequent callers having to\r\nchoose between the window-sill, the matting, and the bedstead.\r\n\r\n'As for the neatness and cleanliness of my sanctum, it was\r\nmarvelous--for Mexico. I don't remember ever seeing more than ten\r\nscorpions at one time there, and two or three tarantulas on the ceiling\r\nwere too much a matter of course to attract notice. Still, I had been so\r\nlong away from civilized society, and endured so many privations, that I\r\nconfess, notwithstanding the attractions that my home offered, I spent\r\nbut little of my time there, for I was warmly received by several\r\nAmerican families, and gladly availed myself of their hospitality and\r\nfriendly attentions. To own the honest truth, ere a month had elapsed, I\r\nhad so well compensated myself for past privations, that I had a serious\r\nattack of illness.\r\n\r\n'To this illness was I indebted for my second interview with my worthy\r\nlandlady, Donna Teresa Lopez, who had been invisible since the day on\r\nwhich my lucky stars first guided me to her roof. This worthy woman, who\r\nwas somewhere between forty and sixty years of age, (Mexican women, be\r\nit understood, when once they pass thirty, enter on a career of the most\r\nambiguous antiquity,) had two branches of business, of which she claimed\r\na thorough knowledge--tobacco and medicine. My sickness, therefore, was\r\nto her a source of intense gratification. She was everlastingly bringing\r\nme some new remedy of her own invention, in spite of which, thanks be to\r\nGod, and a good constitution, I at length rallied, and grew gradually\r\nconvalescent.\r\n\r\n'One night, while lying half-asleep and half-awake, dreamily promising\r\nmyself, if the weather were favorable on the morrow, that I would\r\nventure out of doors, I fancied I heard a voice, muttering words in my\r\nown mother tongue. I rose, and resting on my elbow, listened\r\nattentively--but then a profound silence reigned around me. Persuaded,\r\nthat feeble as I still was, I had mistaken a dream for a reality, I\r\nlanguidly let my head fall back upon my pillow. Scarcely a minute,\r\nhowever, had elapsed, ere a voice whose tone denoted anguish and\r\ndistress, and which seemed to come from the middle of the room,\r\nexclaimed, in distinct English: 'My God! my God! take pity on my\r\nanguish, and in mercy help me!'\r\n\r\n'Assured this time that I was no longer dreaming, I started up again,\r\nand laboring under much excitement, cried out: 'Who is there?'\r\n\r\n'Again all was perfectly silent. Just as I was about to jump out of bed\r\nand explore the mystery, my eye fell upon a faint streak of light, which\r\nglimmered through a crack in the door behind my rocking-chair, near the\r\nfoot of my bed. From the same direction, also, came the sound of a\r\nnervous, unequal, jerking tread, which fully explained a portion of the\r\nmystery. It was pretty evident, first, that I had a neighbor; secondly,\r\nthat he spoke English; and thirdly, that he was either a somnambulist or\r\na soliloquist.\r\n\r\n'This discovery, ordinary and common-place enough in itself, for\r\nEnglishmen and Americans are plentiful enough in Mexico now-a-days,\r\nstill made a very serious impression on my mind, for the words I had\r\noverheard, and above all, the tone in which they were uttered, seemed to\r\nimply something mysterious, and to be the key-note of some dramatic\r\nfragment. For hours I tossed about, pondering over those words, and day\r\nwas dawning ere I fell asleep.\r\n\r\n'The entrance of my learned landlady with a cup brimful of her latest\r\nconcoction, awoke me.\r\n\r\n''Here, Señor,' said she, presenting the dose to me with a serene air of\r\nmatronly confidence, 'Here, Señor, is a tea containing no less than\r\nseventeen different ingredients; and I have a presentiment that this is\r\nthe very thing to perfect your cure.'\r\n\r\n''Thank you a thousand times,' I said, 'but I feel perfectly well this\r\nmorning.'\r\n\r\n''That is no matter--'\r\n\r\n''No matter! _what_ is no matter?'\r\n\r\n''Why, no matter how well you fancy you feel; this is a sovereign\r\nremedy, so just drink it off to please me.'\r\n\r\n''For mercy's sake, Señora, put down your medicine, sit down in the\r\nrocking-chair and draw near to the bedside, for I have several questions\r\nto ask.\r\n\r\n''How long has my present neighbor lodged with you, Señora,' said I,\r\nwhen she had duly ensconced herself. She gazed inquiringly at me, but\r\nwhen I pointed to the door behind her, she replied, with apparent\r\n_nonchalance_:\r\n\r\n''Somewhere about three months.'\r\n\r\n''And who is he?'\r\n\r\n''That is a question I can not answer?'\r\n\r\n''Why not?'\r\n\r\n''Because, over and above his rent, he paid me five dollars to hold my\r\ntongue.'\r\n\r\n''If I were to offer you ten to let it go, how would it be then?'\r\n\r\n''_Ten_ dollars!' replied my hostess, in a ruminating tone of voice.\r\n\r\n''Yes, _ten_ dollars.'\r\n\r\n''I should feel it my duty to my fatherless children to speak,' said\r\nthis excellent mother of the bereaved heirs of the defunct Lopez.\r\n'Yes--holy Virgin, forgive me--but I should feel _bound_ to speak.'\r\n\r\n''It is a bargain, then; Señora, proceed.'\r\n\r\n''Your neighbor, Señor,' replied my hostess, in a low voice, 'is a\r\nheretic--an Englishman.'\r\n\r\n''Not an American?'\r\n\r\n''English or American--what is the difference, any way? I tell you he is\r\na heretic, and you know we Mexicans make no difference between those\r\nheathens--we call them all _Inglez_.''\r\n\r\n'The fair Teresa, I may remark, had always taken me for one of her\r\nfellow-countrymen, as I spoke the language fluently, and had been\r\nthoroughly sun-burnt years before.\r\n\r\n''He arrived here, as I have already had the honor of saying, about\r\nthree months since. He appears very sickly and exhausted, and from the\r\nlook of his clothing I judge he had just returned from a long journey in\r\nthe interior. 'Señora,' said he, when paying his bill in advance, 'I\r\nwish you to speak to no one of my residence in this house. I have no\r\nfamily, no country, and no name; I hate the world; I do not know a soul\r\nin this city, and I do not want to. I expect two inquiries to be made\r\nfor me, one by a man, the other will be by a woman. I will not see any\r\nothers. Should either of them call, their first salutation to you will\r\nbe: 'The price of liberty is eternal vigilance.' Without that pass-word,\r\nI forbid you to allow any one to have access to my room.''\r\n\r\n''Well, Señora Lopez, have these folks with the eternal pass-word turned\r\nup yet?'\r\n\r\n''No, Excellency, during the whole three months he has not had a single\r\nvisitor. Every morning when I take him his chocolate, he promises a\r\ndollar if I can find him a letter at the post-office. So every day I go,\r\nbut unfortunately I have only found two for him in all that time.'\r\n\r\n''But, of course, if you go for his letters, you must know his name, and\r\nsurely you noticed where the two came from, which you received for him.'\r\n\r\n''They were addressed to Albert Pride, and bore the stamp,\r\n'New-Orleans.' But who knows whether that is his real name?'\r\n\r\n''How does he spend his time?'\r\n\r\n''He alone can answer that question. Since the first hour of his\r\nentering the house he has shut himself up in that room, and no one has\r\nseen him quit it. Between you and me, I confess candidly, that my\r\nopinion of him is by no means favorable. Why, would you believe, that\r\nthough he is as thin as a rail and as pale as a ghost, he won't admit\r\nthat he is even slightly indisposed. If I ask him about his symptoms, he\r\ngets angry; and if I offer him any of my specifics, he has the\r\nill-manners to exclaim: 'Bosh! Oh! that man is a wicked fellow; I have\r\nno confidence in him!'\r\n\r\n''Many thanks, Señora Lopez, for your information,' said I, handing her\r\nthe promised reward'--_vaya vm; con Dios!_'\r\n\r\n'After her departure I began to reflect that my own conduct had not been\r\nmuch less dishonorable than hers. What right had I to tear aside the\r\nvail of mystery in which my neighbor wished to wrap himself? I owned to\r\nmyself that I was very clearly in the wrong. And yet, having made this\r\nconcession to the claims of conscience, my fancy was busy putting\r\ntogether the scraps I had gleaned. The field of speculation was so vast\r\nand unbounded that I knew not where to stop. The starting-point was\r\neasy. Curiosity began by asking, Why the deuce, Albert Pride was so\r\ncarefully hiding himself away in the city of Mexico? He must be a\r\nfellow-countryman; because an Englishman, no matter how branded at home,\r\nby fraud or dishonor, could boldly strut about New-Orleans or New-York,\r\nwithout submitting to voluntary self-imprisonment in the city of Mexico.\r\nWas he a fraudulent merchant, or a bank-defaulter? Good heavens! such\r\ngentlemen generally assume such a graceful _nonchalance_, or else laugh\r\nat their little transactions so good-naturedly that such a supposition\r\nwas ridiculous. Well, then, perhaps he had had a personal difficulty? I\r\nthink that is the phrase, is it not, for sending a fellow-mortal on his\r\nlast long journey? What of that? that even would be no reason for\r\nconcealment, for once in Mexico, what had he to dread? Thus I went on,\r\ntormenting my mind with suppositions and conjectures without end, until\r\nat last I resolved to dispel my apparently inextricable tangle of\r\nmystery by taking a walk, as soon as I had finished my breakfast.\r\nAccordingly I sallied forth, turned my steps toward the Alameda, and at\r\nno great distance from one of the fountains I sat down on a bench,\r\nbeneath the shade of one of the grand old trees.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n'The Alameda, during the early part of the day, is perhaps the most\r\nunfrequented spot in the whole city of Mexico; in fact, almost deserted.\r\nIt would be, therefore, unsafe to traverse, were it not that the absence\r\nof victims insured the stray loiterer against any well-grounded fear of\r\nrobbers. Great, therefore, was my surprise at hearing, shortly after I\r\nhad taken my seat, two persons in animated conversation behind the spot\r\nwhich I had selected. A thicket of climbing plants and prickly cactuses\r\nalone separated me from them; but while it prevented me from catching\r\neven a glimpse of their persons, I lost not one word of their\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n''Pedro,' said a full, sonorous voice, 'I am by no means satisfied with\r\nyou. In the management of this business, you have shown a carelessness\r\nthat I can not tolerate. Why, zounds! your acquaintance with Pepito was\r\na most excellent pretext for gaining access to the enemy's camp. You\r\nmight have pretended to be very anxious about Pepito, who I most\r\nheartily wish was at the devil, and what could be more natural than\r\ngoing to make inquiry after him?'\r\n\r\n''Well, General, the fact is this,' said the invisible individual, who\r\nhad been addressed as Pedro, 'much as I am attached to Pepito, I am by\r\nno means anxious to have a bullet through my brains.'\r\n\r\n''Bullet through your brains! what do you mean?'\r\n\r\n''Simply what I say. Now, look here, Señor General, the other day, last\r\nFriday, I succeeded in slipping, during the old woman's absence, to the\r\ndoor of the fellow's room. 'Who is there?' exclaimed the 'Inglez,' in a\r\nloud voice, just as I was about to give the third kick at his door. 'Me,\r\nPedro,' I replied. 'Don't know you,' was the answer, 'you must have\r\nmistaken the room,' 'Not at all, Señor,' said I, 'I come to seek some\r\ntidings of my _compadre_, Pepito.' 'Tidings of Pepito,' repeated the\r\nInglez, 'tidings of Pepito--wait--' So I did wait, congratulating\r\nmyself on the success of my scheme, and handling my knife with a\r\nconfident expectation of making sure work of my man, when I heard the\r\nfloor creak, and looking through the key-hole, I saw the confounded\r\nInglez cocking a pistol and putting a fresh cap on it. And do you know,\r\nGeneral, it somehow happened that when he opened the door, I was at the\r\nbottom of the stairs.'\r\n\r\n''Which means, Pedro, that you ran away like a coward as you are.'\r\n\r\n''_Coward!_--nay, General, you must be joking. The truth is, I\r\nexperienced a new sensation; I felt for the first time the emotion of\r\nfear; yes, that must have been what passed over me. It was something\r\nquite new to me, and for the moment I did not know what ailed me.'\r\n\r\n''Idiot! do you suppose a foreigner would be fool enough to amuse\r\nhimself by shooting a Mexican at mid-day, in the very heart of the\r\ncapital?'\r\n\r\n''Oh! I know very well, General, that it would cost him a small fortune,\r\nif he was rich, and his life if he was poor. But then these Inglez are\r\nso imprudent, so rash, so headstrong, and I felt that I had no wish to\r\nhave a bullet in my head, just to put money into the pocket of the best\r\njudge in the city.'\r\n\r\n''Nonsense; but about those papers. I must have them. What steps do you\r\npropose taking?'\r\n\r\n''General and chief, were I to put my hand upon my heart, and tell you\r\nthe sacred truth, I should say that I propose for a time to lie quiet\r\nand--do nothing.'\r\n\r\n''Do nothing--lie quiet! Do you forget that I have paid you already one\r\nhundred dollars in advance, and that four hundred more are ready for you\r\nwhen your job is finished?'\r\n\r\n''Oh! I know our bargain, General, and I have the greatest confidence in\r\nyour honor. As for abandoning the enterprise, that I have never dreamed\r\nof; but the fact is, my motive in remaining inactive for a season is,\r\nthat I am certain if I make a move now I shall be undoubtedly checked,\r\nperhaps mated.'\r\n\r\n''How so?'\r\n\r\n''Well--because I find at the monte-table, where I usually try my luck,\r\nthat there has been for nearly a week a run on odd numbers. Now, I\r\nalways remark that when there is a run on odds, I always lose in every\r\nthing I put my hand to. Stop, then, General, till the tables turn, and\r\nwhen I strike a new vein, you shall hear from your servant, Pedro.'\r\n\r\n'Of course I waited, expecting to hear the General burst forth in\r\nviolent denunciations on his servant, Pedro, or at any rate supposed he\r\nwould ridicule such an excuse; but I was deceived.\r\n\r\n''Well, Pedro, your excuse is not so bad; had you explained yourself at\r\nthe outset, I should not have been so angry.'\r\n\r\n'The Mexicans, it may be remarked, are influenced in the most important\r\nand momentous actions of their life, by superstition; this fact is\r\nreadily explained, when we reflect that the vast majority of them are\r\nutterly devoid of the very first rudiments of education, and owe the\r\nposition they occupy to the fortune of civil war or of the\r\ngambling-table. Except in the mere texture and richness of their\r\ncostume, nothing else in that strange country of the grotesque and\r\npicturesque, distinguishes the man of rank from the beggar or the\r\n_lazzaroni_. In every class, in every rank, you meet with the same\r\nsimplicity, the same vanity, the same prejudices, the same superstition,\r\nthe same purity of language, the same grace of elocution. The beggar,\r\nwrapped in his tatters, displays the self-same exquisite polish of\r\nmanners, the same courteous bearing, as the senator or the millionaire,\r\nin velvet and gold. After all, it must be ever remembered that perhaps\r\nthe senator was once a beggar, and that ere long the beggar may be a\r\nsenator. One or two lucky hits at monte, and in a few, short hours, lo!\r\nthe metamorphosis is complete.'\r\n\r\n'You can readily believe that the conversation I had thus overheard\r\ninterested me greatly; however the promptings of curiosity would have\r\nriveted me to my seat, the dictates of prudence warned me to retire as\r\nquickly and stealthily as possible.\r\n\r\n'With a tread as noiseless as practicable, I therefore turned my\r\nfootsteps to the main avenue, and keeping an eye always on the spot I\r\nhad left, I took another seat near the main entrance. Not much more than\r\na quarter of an hour could have elapsed, when along the same path I had\r\nmyself taken, I saw two men approaching. One of them was a tall and very\r\nhandsome man; he flourished in his hand a cane with massive gold head,\r\nand walked with a military air, in fact, with the air of a hero and a\r\nconqueror; perfectly well-dressed, in the latest European fashion;\r\nindeed, had it not been for the immense profusion of gold chain, and\r\nsparkling rings upon his fingers, instead of gloves, you might have\r\nalmost mistaken him for a _gentleman_. His companion presented the most\r\nstriking contrast. His face, shaded by a torn, slouched hat, was dirty\r\nand coffee-colored. Of short stature, slight build, and\r\nround-shouldered, he followed his master, with an humble, abject look,\r\nand from his tread, you would almost have imagined that he was anxious\r\nnot to leave any track behind, of his footsteps on the gravel walk. A\r\nvelvet cloak, so worn and patched that a _lazzaroni_ would only have\r\nyielded to the temptation of stealing it, from a love of art and not\r\nfrom any hope of its being of any earthly use to him, was thrown across\r\nhis shoulders, beneath which appeared pantaloons ornamented on the outer\r\nseam of each leg with long-shanked brass buttons, covered with\r\nverdigris, and boots of Spanish leather, outrageously dilapidated.\r\n\r\n'As they drew nearer to my seat, I became more and more impressed that\r\nthe handsome flourisher of the gold-headed cane was not unknown to me. I\r\nwas not mistaken, for as he passed me his eye caught mine, and with a\r\nfriendly wave of the hand, he honored me with a most polite recognition.\r\nIt was General Valiente, one of the most celebrated or rather notorious\r\n'ladies' men' in Mexico.\r\n\r\n'From the fact of his companion having addressed him as General, and\r\nfrom the direction in which I had watched them come, I was at no loss to\r\nidentify General Valiente and his companion with the invisible talkers\r\nwho had so unwittingly imparted their secrets to me.\r\n\r\n'I noticed that immediately on leaving the Alameda, General Valiente and\r\nhis friend Pedro separated, without further parley, and each took\r\ndirectly opposite roads.\r\n\r\n'This adventure took firm hold of my mind, and for nearly two hours I\r\nremained seated in the Alameda, revolving it over and over. Personally,\r\nI knew but little of this General Valiente; but by hearsay, much. His\r\nname was connected with various strange stories, in which jealous\r\nhusbands, duels, poniards, and poison figured very largely, and it had\r\nbeen hinted that had Eugene Sue been acquainted with Valiente, there\r\nmight have been forthcoming one of the most intensely interesting\r\nhistories relative to the mysteries of Mexico.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n'Time passed on, until the promptings of an empty stomach began to\r\nremind me that my dinner-hour was at hand, if not already passed; but I\r\nstill sat there, ruminating. At last, however, I arose, and slowly\r\nwalked up the magnificent _Calle des Plateros_, which leads directly\r\ninto the Cathedral Square. Whilst thus sauntering along, my gaze fell on\r\na young and lovely female, whose eyes were intently fixed on me, and\r\nwho, I fancied, to my extreme surprise, was preparing to address me.\r\nFearing, however, that I might be laboring under a delusion, and\r\ndreading to involve myself in a ridiculous dilemma, although I had\r\ninstinctively almost halted, I quickened my step, when, to my great\r\ndelight, she stepped toward me, her lovely face suffused with blushes.\r\n\r\n'Doubt was at an end. Raising my hat, and approaching her most\r\nrespectfully, I inquired if fortune had so favored me as to enable me to\r\nbe of any possible service to her, and if so, I was at her orders.\r\n\r\n''Señor, I have simply to beg some information; can you direct me which\r\nstreet will lead me to the Cathedral Square?'\r\n\r\n''I am myself going thither, Señora, and if you will permit me to walk\r\nbeside you, I shall be most happy to show you the way.'\r\n\r\n'For a few moments, she hesitated, and I seized the opportunity to\r\nexamine her more attentively. Hair as black as the raven's wing, large\r\nblue eyes, a face perfectly oval, a mouth of the smallest and the most\r\nexpressive mold, lips the reddest and most faultless it is possible to\r\nimagine, composed the details of the lovely whole, which at the first\r\nglimpse had dazzled and attracted me. Probably my respectful admiration\r\nwas legible on my countenance, for after a few seconds, the youthful\r\nbeauty accepted my proffered guidance.\r\n\r\n''Would you deem me too impertinent, were I to ask you one question,\r\nSeñora?' said I, after we had proceeded a few steps.\r\n\r\n''Of course that will in a great measure depend on the question you are\r\nabout to ask,' she replied, giving at the same time a sweet smile.\r\n\r\n''Are you a native of Mexico, Señora?'\r\n\r\n''No, Señor,' answered she, after a momentary pause, 'I am not a\r\nMexican; but may I, in return, inquire what induced you to doubt it?'\r\n\r\n''Madame, if you will excuse my candor, my doubts were excited by your\r\nSpanish.'\r\n\r\n''O Señor! I am aware that I speak it very poorly.'\r\n\r\n''If I am not greatly mistaken, you are a native of _la belle_ France.'\r\n\r\n'The beautiful stranger turned pale. 'What possible interest, Señor, can\r\nit be to you as to who or what I am?' This she asked with an earnest\r\nlook, so piercing and fixed as to astonish me in any woman.\r\n\r\n''No interest, madame, but it would be a pleasure; for my mother's\r\nancestors were French, and I am, therefore, ever happy to have an\r\nopportunity to be of any service to one whom I am permitted to look upon\r\nas in some degree a country-woman.'\r\n\r\n''I am not from France, Señor, although my ancestry, like yours, is\r\nFrench. I am a native of New-Orleans.'\r\n\r\n''Better still, madame,' Said I, 'for then I am indeed your\r\nfellow-countryman; for I was born in the Sunny South, not far distant\r\nfrom Mobile--but, madame, I fear you feel ill?'\r\n\r\n''Oh! no--ill--it is nothing--the heat--and I am fatigued, sir; pray,\r\nare we far from the Cathedral Square?'\r\n\r\n''Three minutes more will bring us to it, madame; you can already see\r\nthe steps of the cathedral.'\r\n\r\n''Then, sir, I have only to thank you for your kindness,' she replied,\r\nbowing her head most gracefully.\r\n\r\n'There was no mistaking her thanks for any thing but a desire to dismiss\r\nme, so I once more bowed to her, and she, to dispel every possibility of\r\ndoubt, quickened her pace, so as to be rid of me as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n'Without altering my gait, I pursued the even tenor of my way, when,\r\nwhat was my surprise to see her stop before the door of my domicile.\r\n\r\n'As she was in the act of ascending the steps, she turned round, and as\r\nI was not many yards behind her, it happened that I was the first person\r\nwho met her eye. I noticed she seemed for a few moments to hesitate, and\r\nthen apparently obeying some sudden impulse, she walked toward me.\r\n\r\n''Sir,' said she, with the same earnest, piercing glance, which had\r\nbefore struck me; 'Sir, this conduct is neither polite nor honorable,\r\nand if you really are an American, you must know that to play the spy on\r\na lone female is not manly.'\r\n\r\n''Good heavens! madame,' said I, as coolly as possible, 'perhaps you\r\nwill allow me to explain, that my conduct is simply that of a man who is\r\nreturning home to dine.'\r\n\r\n''Home! why, is this your residence?'\r\n\r\n''Exactly so, madame.'\r\n\r\n'This explanation evidently annoyed her, but she added coldly:\r\n\r\n''Excuse, then, sir, the error into which my hastiness has betrayed me.\r\nI regret my ill-judged impetuosity. May I inquire, sir, if you are\r\nacquainted with any of the persons dwelling in this house?'\r\n\r\n''With the exception of Donna Lopez, the landlady, I do not know a\r\nsingle soul.'\r\n\r\n''Would you inform her, sir, that I wish to speak with her?'\r\n\r\n''With much pleasure.'\r\n\r\n'Opening the door, I immediately proceeded to summon Donna Teresa.\r\n\r\n''Señora,' said I, 'here is a lady who is anxious to see you.'\r\n\r\n'My beauteous countrywoman gave a most expressive look, which very\r\nclearly signified that my instant departure would be satisfactory to her\r\nfeelings, but my curiosity was so far kindled that I pretended not to\r\nunderstand, but remained standing near the door. My want of tact seemed\r\nonce more to vex her, but after a moment's reflection, she addressed the\r\nworthy Teresa.\r\n\r\n''Señora,' said she, in a low voice, but still not so low but I could\r\noverhear, 'The price of liberty is eternal vigilance.'\r\n\r\n''If you will follow me, Señora, I will show you to Mr. Albert Pride's\r\nrooms,' said mine hostess, as she led the way up-stairs.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n''Well, Doctor of mine,' said I, addressing the disinterested Teresa,\r\nwhen after a delay of some twenty minutes she appeared with my dinner,\r\n'what do you think of our last new arrival? Matters are beginning to\r\ngrow a little complicated.'\r\n\r\n''What do I think? Why, I think that she is marvelously beautiful; such\r\na perfect beauty I never saw before. But yet, her eye displeases me.'\r\n\r\n''That, allow me to remark, is not a very logical conclusion.'\r\n\r\n''Oh! as for a logical conclusion, I don't know what that is; but I know\r\njust what I feel, though perhaps I can't tell you in words, why I do\r\nfeel so; but I am candid, I am; and I tell you, I don't like her eye.'\r\n\r\n'After Donna Teresa's departure, I sat with the book which usually\r\nserved me as a companion at meal-times, wide open on the table, but it\r\nremained unread. My strange encounter with this beautiful stranger had\r\ntaken entire possession of my mind. What could be the link between her\r\nand this Albert Pride, who had for three months been awaiting her\r\narrival? Why should she be as anxious as he to avoid recognition? For\r\nevery thing conspired to prove this--her emotion when I asked if she\r\nwere French, her pallor and faintness when I claimed to be a\r\nfellow-citizen, her indignation at the thought of my playing the spy\r\nupon her, and her hesitation to speak in my presence to Donna Lopez--all\r\ntended to show she desired to preserve the strictest _incognito_.\r\n\r\n'The convent-bells of all Mexico were ringing the _Angelus_, and I was\r\nstill seated at the dinner-table, absorbed in deep thought. My\r\nimagination had been so racked that it passed from the domain of the\r\nreal, and reveled in the most fantastic regions of the ideal, and it\r\nrequired a strong effort of the will to bring back my mind to the dull\r\nmatter-of-fact aspects of actual life.\r\n\r\n'As the evening promised to be magnificent, I determined to refresh my\r\nmind by taking a brisk walk.\r\n\r\n'Passing down the Calle del Arco, I met an acquaintance, at whose\r\nsolicitation I entered one of the most fashionably-frequented\r\ngambling-houses in the city; it was about nine o'clock, and quite a\r\nnumber of players were assembled.\r\n\r\n'Soon after taking my stand at the board of green cloth, so as to have a\r\ngood view of the game, and to watch the conflicting emotions depicted\r\non the countenances of these devotees of the fickle goddess, I felt a\r\ngentle tap on the shoulder, and turning round, beheld at my side General\r\nValiente.\r\n\r\n''Would you, Señor Rideau, have the goodness to give me an ounce in\r\nexchange for sixteen dollars?'\r\n\r\n''Certainly, General.' And I immediately handed it to him, placing the\r\ndollars he gave me in return, on the table immediately before me.\r\n\r\n''You had better see if it is all right,' said he.\r\n\r\n''It is not necessary, General.'\r\n\r\n''Oh! I beg of you to count them, an error is so easily committed.'\r\n\r\n'Accordingly I counted the pile, and found there were only fifteen.\r\n\r\n''You see now, Señor, how necessary it is to be particular. I am\r\ndelighted now that I pressed upon you to examine them; you see I owe you\r\na dollar.' Saying which, he turned to the table and put down his stake.\r\n\r\n'After two or three games, I suggested to my friend that it was about\r\ntime to leave, but before retiring, I just put down five dollars as my\r\none offering to chance. A very short suspense was all that I had to\r\nendure, for in a minute my card won.\r\n\r\n'The croupier, after raking in his winnings and paying two or three of\r\nhis losses, took up my stake, and after quietly glancing at each coin,\r\nheld them out toward me, and said:\r\n\r\n''I do not feel bound to pay.'\r\n\r\n''Why not, I should like to know?'\r\n\r\n''Because, Caballero, your dollars are spurious.'\r\n\r\n''General Valiente,' said I, raising my voice, 'here is this croupier\r\npretending that the money I received from you just now, is false.'\r\n\r\n''The croupier is an impertinent rascal, whose ears I would crop off if\r\nI had him any where else than where we are,' said the General. 'As for\r\nyour dollars, my dear Caballero, I really can not vouch for their\r\npurity, you know there are such gangs of counterfeiters throughout the\r\ncountry. You see how far I was right in begging you to examine them just\r\nnow. This little accident now will impress it on your mind and make you\r\nmore cautious in future.'\r\n\r\n'I knew too much of Mexican life to be surprised at this cool reply. As\r\nfor resenting the General's conduct, I did not for an instant dream of\r\nit. Military men in Mexico assume, and in fact enjoy such extensive\r\nprivileges, that to have made a fuss about such a trifle would been\r\nlooked on by all civilians as sheer madness. I therefore merely examined\r\nmy pile very carefully, and congratulated myself at finding that three\r\nout of the fifteen were genuine. It was very evident that despite his\r\nvery sound advice, my friend General Valiente had neglected to examine\r\nthem with any great nicety.\r\n\r\n'While thus engaged, the clocks struck ten, and at the sound the players\r\narose to stretch their legs and take part in the interlude. Servants\r\nappeared with what passed for refreshments, that is to say, tumblers and\r\ndecanters containing three or four different kinds of liquor, all of\r\ndomestic manufacture, and which differed only in their colors. Glasses\r\nand decanters soon circulated freely, and each man helped himself\r\nwithout stint.\r\n\r\n'Seated near the door, chatting to two or three Americans, my attention\r\nwas attracted by the entrance of a ranchero, gayly dressed in the rich\r\nnational costume of the country. His jaunty air amused me, and I\r\nmoreover fancied I recognized his features. After running his eye over\r\nthe assemblage, his countenance brightened up, and with an air of\r\nboldness he walked directly toward a window, where with his back to us,\r\nwas standing my delectable friend, the General.\r\n\r\n'I can scarcely define the feeling which prompted me, but instinctively\r\nI changed my seat for one not far distant from the window.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n'On beholding the ranchero, Valiente was unable to suppress an outburst\r\nof ill-humor.\r\n\r\n''What do you come here for, Pedro?' said he, lowering his voice; 'you\r\nknow well enough that I have forbidden you to accost me in public.'\r\n\r\n'This flattering reception, however, did not disturb Pedro's equanimity.\r\n\r\n''Before you fly off into a passion, General,' said he, 'perhaps you\r\nwill deign to cast a glance at my change of attire. How does it strike\r\nyou?'\r\n\r\n''Oh! good enough, good enough, Pedro, but--'\r\n\r\n''Suits me admirably, I think, don't you? I need not say it's the\r\nfirst-fruits of a lucky hit. The run on the odds gave up, and I went in\r\nand won twice running on the evens. I find it impossible to express to\r\nyou, General, my delight, the intense joy I experienced, when I threw\r\nthat villainous old suit of mine out of the window, it was a hideous\r\nabomination, and I really felt ashamed to walk with you this morning\r\nacross the Alameda. But now luck has changed; Pedro and the evens win,\r\nand I feel ready to undertake what other men might deem\r\nimpossibilities.'\r\n\r\n''I am very glad your luck has turned, Pedro, and I appreciate your\r\nwillingness to act; but as I before told you, you must not be seen\r\ntalking to me, thus publicly, so be off quickly.'\r\n\r\n''Yes, I know all that, General, but first let me hand you a letter that\r\nI received just now from Brown and Hunt.'\r\n\r\n''Hush! Are you drunk or mad, to mention names in such a place as this?'\r\n\r\n'The General looked around him, but the precision with which I was\r\ncomparing my watch with the clock over the mantelpiece, saved me from\r\nsuspicion, and he resumed his conversation, in a voice which evidently\r\nbetokened suppressed rage.\r\n\r\n''Listen, Pedro; twice have I expressly forbidden you holding any\r\ncommunication with that firm; beware, lest I find you daring again to\r\ndisobey me. This once more I will overlook it; but keep this well in\r\nmind, that it is far better to have me for your friend than your enemy.\r\nNow not another word; begone!'\r\n\r\n'Pedro, whose consequential air had gradually faded into one of deep\r\nhumility, as soon as the General ceased speaking, bowed very low and\r\nleft without uttering a sound. The voice of the croupier was soon heard\r\nannouncing that the monte would recommence, and yielding to the pressing\r\ninvitation of those around me, I resumed my position at the table.\r\n\r\n'It was past midnight ere the bank closed, and I rose the winner of some\r\nten ounces. Not being at all ambitious of exciting the cupidity of the\r\nless fortunate brethren around me, I was very particular in intrusting\r\nall my money to the croupier and taking his receipt for it, payable to\r\nmy order. This precaution settled in the most public manner, I bade my\r\nfriends good night.\r\n\r\n'At the foot of the stairs I found General Valiente waiting for me,\r\napparently, for he accosted me in the most gracious tone, and bowed with\r\nthe most exquisite air of well-bred politeness.\r\n\r\n''Believe me, Señor Rideau, I feel extremely mortified about that little\r\naffair of the counterfeit dollars.'\r\n\r\n''You are altogether too considerate, General, to think about the matter\r\nin any way.'\r\n\r\n''O Señor! such a circumstance jars upon my feelings; those confounded\r\nvillains! we must have a strong government, and make an example of some\r\nof them. I feel anxious to make amends to you--something more than a\r\nmere apology. Now an idea struck me as I came down-stairs. Will you\r\noblige me by allowing me to buy the spurious dollars? Well, now, suppose\r\nI give you four good ones, it will be so much out of the fire.'\r\n\r\n''Willingly, General, most willingly; but the fact is, I can only return\r\nyou twelve; I have a particular use for the other three.'\r\n\r\n''Ah! you sly rogue, you passed off three on the croupier, eh? Well,\r\nthat is not so bad.'\r\n\r\n''General, you flatter me too highly. I assure you I have a special\r\npurpose for three of them.'\r\n\r\n''Oh! well,' said he, 'it is not of the least importance; I happen to\r\nhave four dollars in my pocket, and I will give them to you in exchange\r\nfor your twelve, rather than see a friend lose all.'\r\n\r\n''General, I thank you a thousand times; here are your twelve\r\ncounterfeits.'\r\n\r\n''O Señor! pray do not mention thanks; between caballeros, there is no\r\nneed for thanks; I have only done the right thing; here are four genuine\r\ndollars. Good-night--pleasant dreams.'\r\n\r\n'Half-past twelve was striking as I reached, without further adventure,\r\nthe door of my habitation.\r\n\r\n''Who is there?' cried I, as I suddenly beheld, a few steps from the\r\ndoor, wrapped in a large cloak, leaning against the railing, a tall man.\r\n\r\n'The unknown made no reply. I therefore stepped back and drew out my\r\nrevolver. Dialogues carried on by knives and fire-arms are by no means\r\nof rare occurrence at mid-night in the streets of Mexico; but I was\r\nanxious, ere proceeding to extremities, to have a good look at my\r\nantagonist. Although the Cathedral Square was illumined by a magnificent\r\nmoonlight, still I could not succeed. His hat was forced down over his\r\nbrow; his ample cloak was raised, and the folds covered the lower\r\nportion of his face entirely. I could distinguish only a pair of glaring\r\neyes, and also discover that his long hair, which nearly reached his\r\nshoulders, was almost perfectly white.\r\n\r\n'The contemptuous silence and disdainful listlessness of my cloaked\r\nadversary tended rather to enrage than calm me; so, with my revolver in\r\nfull view, and my arm stretched forth, I advanced toward him.\r\n\r\n''I have already once demanded who you are, and you have not seen fit to\r\nanswer me. As I intend entering this house, and can not do so in safety,\r\nsince you block my passage, and may have a dagger hidden beneath your\r\ncloak, I warn you, unless you clear the way, I shall be obliged to\r\nproceed to violent means to enforce my demand.'\r\n\r\n'Whether the unknown was duly impressed with wholesome prudence, by the\r\ntone of my voice and the sight of my pistol; whether, finding he had\r\nwoke up the wrong customer, he determined to change his tactics; or\r\nwhether he had no sinister motives, I could not then determine; suffice\r\nit to say, he evacuated the disputed territory, and with a measured and\r\nmajestic step, moved away some eight or ten paces, reminding me of a\r\nstage bandit, in some Bowery melodrama.\r\n\r\n'Keeping my face toward him, and letting no movement of his body escape\r\nme, I knocked loudly at the door, and in a minute more Donna Lopez\r\nherself opened it, and I entered.\r\n\r\n'Mexican houses all are provided with two doors, and my hostess and I\r\nhad not crossed the vestibule leading to the inner one, when the knocker\r\nfell on the outer door, with a force that fairly startled the obese\r\nTeresa.\r\n\r\n''Holy Virgin!' exclaimed she, 'who can be there at this hour? But\r\nangels defend us, why, Señor, have you your pistol in your hand?'\r\n\r\n'In a few words, I explained to her the adventure which had befallen me\r\nat the door; but ere I had fairly ended, the door shook with the\r\nincreased violence with which the knocker now fell upon it. I rushed\r\nforward to open it.\r\n\r\n''For mercy's sake, Señor, be prudent; do not open it,' said my\r\nterrified hostess, 'wait--wait, I will go myself.'\r\n\r\n'Poor Donna Teresa, overpowered by fear, was slower than even was her\r\ncustom, in obeying the impetuous summons, and as she reached the door,\r\nit shook for the third time beneath the rapid blows of the knocker.\r\n\r\n'Who is there?' said she, in a faltering tone, opening a little slide\r\nwhich was so protected by bars and cross-bars as to prevent the\r\nintrusion of a dagger or even the muzzle of a pistol; 'who is there?'\r\n\r\n''_The price of liberty is eternal vigilance_,' was the answer from\r\nwithout.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n'Donna Lopez looked at me with terror and amazement.\r\n\r\n''This must be the man Señor Pride has been so impatiently waiting for\r\nduring the past three months,' said she, 'he must be admitted.'\r\n\r\n''One moment, Señora, let me first put one question to this impetuous\r\nstranger; perchance he may have uttered these words without knowing\r\ntheir full import.'\r\n\r\n''Friend,' said I, approaching the grating, 'it is very true that 'the\r\nprice of liberty is eternal vigilance;' but allow me to suggest that\r\nthis is not a very appropriate hour for uttering truisms, however\r\nexcellent, especially in the way you do. Let peaceable people retire to\r\nrest, and take my advice and get you to your own home.'\r\n\r\n''I must see Albert Pride without delay; imminent danger threatens him.\r\nIf you persist in refusing me admittance, on your head be the\r\nconsequences.'\r\n\r\n'This reply dissipated all doubt. I opened the door immediately. A man,\r\nwrapped in a large cloak, entered, whom I instantly recognized as the\r\nsame person I had found leaning against the rails. His face, no longer\r\nconcealed, betrayed evidence of deep emotion.\r\n\r\n'Taking a small lamp in her hand, Donna Teresa, after casting a piteous\r\nglance toward me, as though she were begging me not to lose sight of\r\nthem, told the stranger to follow her, and she would show him the way.\r\nHe followed, without uttering a word.\r\n\r\n''This is the door of Señor Pride's room,' said she, on reaching the\r\nhead of the stairs.\r\n\r\n''Señora,' said the stranger, 'it may be that he is a sound sleeper, and\r\nmay not answer my first rap. I will therefore, with your permission,\r\ntake the lamp, and will not detain you longer.'\r\n\r\n'How far this proposition suited my worthy hostess, I can not say; at\r\nany rate, she made no opposition. As we retired, we heard a firm hand\r\nrattling the handle of Pride's door.\r\n\r\n'The sleeping-room I occupied, although contiguous to and on the same\r\nfloor with Albert Pride's, was reached by another staircase. It was very\r\nnarrow; but I was so familiar now with the house, that I did not wait\r\nfor my hostess to bring a light, especially as I had candles in my room.\r\nAs I entered my room, I fancied I heard a gentle tapping at the door,\r\nwhich was closed up near the foot of my bed, and to which I have already\r\nalluded. If opened, I knew it must lead into Pride's apartments.\r\n\r\n'Again I heard the tapping, and exclaimed: 'Who is there?'\r\n\r\n''Open the door, for Heaven's sake, open the door,' was the reply, in a\r\nlow tone; 'quick, my life is in danger!'\r\n\r\n'I approached the door, and in equally low tones asked: 'Who are you?'\r\n\r\n''A woman--but quick, open--open the door, for every moment is precious.\r\nI tell you my life is at stake!'\r\n\r\n'It seemed to me it was rather a time for action than for explanations,\r\nso, taking an excellent Spanish dagger, which I had had in my possession\r\nmany years, I succeeded in wrenching out the two staples which fastened\r\nthe door on my side, and then putting my mouth to the key-hole, I asked:\r\n'Have you the key?'\r\n\r\n''Yes.'\r\n\r\n''Then unlock the door, and bring the key with you to this side.'\r\n\r\n'A few moments more, and a woman, to judge from the lightness of the\r\ntread, for I was still without light, precipitated herself into, rather\r\nthan entered, the room.\r\n\r\n''Oh! thanks; from my heart I thank you, Señor, whoever you are; I owe\r\nmy life to your kind assistance.'\r\n\r\n'The sound of her voice, which I at once recognized, changed the\r\nsuspicion which had from the first moment flashed upon my mind, into\r\nfull assurance.\r\n\r\n''Do not be afraid, madame,' said I, 'you are in perfect safety here.\r\nDo you lock the door, while I look to my candles.'\r\n\r\n'The first object my candle brought to light was the pale but still\r\ncharming face of my beautiful country-woman.\r\n\r\n''You, sir!' she exclaimed, scarcely able to suppress her astonishment.\r\n'In mercy I implore you, save me from the fury of my husband.'\r\n\r\n''Of Mr. Albert Pride?'\r\n\r\n''No, sir, Albert is not my husband; but, listen!--do you not\r\nhear?--they are quarreling--they are struggling.'\r\n\r\n'I listened. She was not mistaken. In spite of the two partitions which\r\nseparated us from the scene of this angry interview, we distinctly heard\r\nthe furious accents of passion. All at once a violent shock made the\r\nwall--thin enough, it is true--creak and rattle; then, a moment\r\nafterward, we heard the fall as of a body, accompanied with a low moan.\r\n\r\n''Albert is dead! He has murdered him; but woe be to him. I will be\r\nrevenged yet,' exclaimed my companion, her eyes glaring with unearthly\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n'At this moment, hasty footsteps sounded in the adjoining room, which I\r\nsubsequently discovered was Pride's bed-chamber.\r\n\r\n''Sir,' said a voice choked with anger, 'you are a coward, and shall\r\ngive me satisfaction for this insult.'\r\n\r\n''You brought it on yourself, by your own obstinacy. Had you not opposed\r\nmy entrance to this room, I should not have used violence toward _you_,\r\nat any rate. As for the satisfaction you claim, I will think about\r\nthat.'\r\n\r\n''Well, you see that your wife is not here,' replied Albert, after a\r\nshort silence, during which we could hear the furniture being moved,\r\nclosets opened, and the curtain-rings rattle.\r\n\r\n''True, sir; but her absence only proves one thing, that in one\r\nparticular I have been misinformed.'\r\n\r\n''Confess rather, egregiously duped.'\r\n\r\n''_Duped!_--nay, you are the dupe. Will you, Arthur Livermore, give me\r\nyour word of honor as a gentleman, that my wife, Adéle Percival, has not\r\nfollowed you to Mexico? Will you deny that she is now your mistress?'\r\n\r\n''Yes, sir, I give you my word of honor,' replied Albert or Arthur, in a\r\nlow, husky voice.\r\n\r\n''And I tell you, Arthur Livermore, to your teeth, you are a miserable,\r\ncontemptible liar! Nay, seek not to deny it, it is useless; for I hold\r\nhere the proof, in your own writing. Look, here is your last letter; it\r\narrived two days after Adéle left New-Orleans. You acknowledge that--for\r\nyou turn pale at your own treachery. I bribed the tool who acted as your\r\ngo-between, so you see I attached some importance to securing proof. You\r\nspoke, I think, of being duped. Arthur, I am amazed at your effrontery;\r\nbut I wait to hear your defense.'\r\n\r\n'A fresh silence followed this outburst of the outraged husband, a\r\nsilence which was only broken by the heavy, rapid breathing of the two\r\nadversaries.\r\n\r\n''You must indeed have passionately loved that woman, or you, Arthur,\r\ncould never have been led to forswear your word of honor. O Arthur,\r\nArthur! be warned; I swear to you before heaven, that woman, with all\r\nher beauty--a beauty that I once deemed angelic--is possessed by devils\r\nwhose name is legion; her heart is the receptacle of a monstrous,\r\nhideous crowd of vices--vices the most opposite, there nestle together:\r\nbrazen effrontery and cringing cowardice; sordid cupidity and the most\r\nlavish, reckless prodigality. With her, every act is the result of deep,\r\ncool calculation. No generous impulse ever beat within her breast; and\r\nlove, except for self, never yet was awakened from its deathlike torpor.\r\nShe married me because I was reputed rich; she deserted me because she\r\ndeemed me ruined. What motive impelled her to follow you to Mexico, I\r\nknow not. But of this I warn you, rest assured it is not love for\r\nyou--you perchance, may be useful to her; the necessary instrument to\r\nfurther some new scheme. But remember General Ramiro's fate, and take\r\nheed lest you be the next dupe--the next victim.'\r\n\r\n'I turned involuntarily toward the youthful creature beside me, as her\r\nhusband's voice ceased to ring on my ears. Despite the mastery she\r\nexercised over her feelings, I nevertheless perceived she trembled; but\r\nwho, save the Judge of all, can tell whether it arose from fear, rage,\r\nor the first emotion of repentance.\r\n\r\n''Mr. Percival,' replied my neighbor, in a constrained voice, 'this\r\ninterview, after the violence which commenced it, must naturally be most\r\npainful to me, and I presume equally so to you. Allow me, in as few\r\nwords as possible, to bring it to a close. I own that I was wrong in\r\npledging my word of honor to what was not wholly true. Until you claimed\r\nAdéle here this night, as your wife, I had for months supposed you had\r\nabandoned all title to the name of husband; that you had mutually\r\nconsented to a divorce, and under that impression I denied that Adéle\r\nwas my mistress, for in February last, I was married to her at Baton\r\nRouge. In presence of the proofs you possess, it were useless to deny\r\nthat Adéle is at this moment in this city. I have seen her this very\r\nday, and I own that I know where she resides. More than this, it will be\r\nuseless for you to attempt to extort from me. I refuse beforehand to\r\nanswer any further interrogatory. I can fully conceive the hatred my\r\npresence must inspire within your breast; I will not even pretend to\r\nregret it; for this hatred, springing from a sense of dishonor, will\r\npreclude the possibility of any thing save the death of one of us,\r\nterminating the appeal for satisfaction which I have already claimed. I\r\nhave done, sir, and wait your reply.'\r\n\r\n'Some seconds elapsed ere Adéle's husband replied. His voice had grown\r\ncalmer and more restrained, and I imagined that he had recovered his\r\nself-control.\r\n\r\n''Arthur,' said he, 'I shall not challenge you, neither will I accept a\r\nchallenge from you.'\r\n\r\n''You refuse to meet me,' said my neighbor, 'and for what reason?'\r\n\r\n''Because I do not hate, I merely pity you; because he who first defiled\r\nmy home, lies in his sandy grave beside the waters of Lake Ponchartrain;\r\nbecause beside that grave I vowed to my Maker and my God never again to\r\ndare to take into these blood-stained hands the holy scales of justice.\r\nYes, Arthur, it is four long years since I sent that wretched victim of\r\nthat woman to his last solemn reckoning. Look at me to-day; my locks are\r\nwhite; 'tis not with age: I have not yet lived out the half of man's\r\nallotted span on earth. But that bleeding corpse; the trickling, oozing\r\ndrops from out that breast; the gurgling sound of the unuttered\r\ndeath-words of Adéle's first seducer--these have made me prematurely\r\nold. Oh! woe to him who dares to seek and takes revenge. Vengeance has\r\nbeen claimed as Heaven's sole, supreme prerogative. Arthur, I must, I do\r\nrefuse your challenge.'\r\n\r\n''Sir, I shall not deign to notice your calumnies about Adéle, for I am\r\nanxious to terminate this interview. May I ask why you seek to prolong\r\nit, and why, if you so loathe Adéle, you persecute me by following her?'\r\n\r\n''Because I am resolved on two points--to see her, and to learn from her\r\nwhere she has secreted our child.'\r\n\r\n''Unless you pledge yourself, Mr. Percival, not to make any further\r\nattempt to see Adéle, you shall not, if I can prevent, leave this room\r\nalive.'\r\n\r\n''Oh! oh! finding I won't fight, you fancy you can frighten me by\r\nthreats of assassination. It is rather creditable to your ingenuity, Mr.\r\nLivermore, but I had provided for such a contingency. The United States\r\nMinister has been apprized of my arrival, and I left certain papers with\r\nhis Secretary to be opened to-morrow, in case I should not return by\r\nnoon, explaining our mutual relations very concisely yet definitely.\r\nNow you know that the Mexican idea of justice, though lenient in the\r\nextreme to natives, is just as extremely severe to foreigners, so that I\r\nwould hardly advise you to tempt the gallows, unless, indeed, you have\r\nless objection to suicide, for I really think that is the only way you\r\ncan possibly cheat the hangman, unless you condescend to allow me to pay\r\nmy respects to the American Legation to-morrow, in the forenoon.'\r\n\r\n'On the stage, especially in the sanguinary melodrama, it is astonishing\r\nhow little respect is paid to the gallows; but somehow in the humbler\r\nwalks of every day life, it exercises a very salutary, deterring\r\ninfluence on a very large class of minds; and I was, therefore, in no\r\nway surprised to hear my neighbor resume the conversation in a tone\r\ndecidedly an octave or two lower.\r\n\r\n''You have entirely misinterpreted my meaning. I may have thought of\r\nhere forcing a quarrel on you, but the commission of the crime you dare\r\ninsinuate, never entered my brain. But, now, sir, one last question: Why\r\ndo you persist in seeking an interview with the woman you pretend to\r\nhate?'\r\n\r\n''Pretend to hate! nay, there is no pretense, I hate, detest, and loathe\r\nher; not because she betrayed me; not because she stained an honorable\r\nname; not because she made me kill her lover; not because she has ruined\r\nmy happiness; but because knowing--feeling all this, and more than words\r\nhave power to convey--because knowing her infamy and shame, I still,\r\nstill love her.'\r\n\r\n''_You_ love her still!' cried Arthur. 'Oh! thanks for that one avowal;\r\nthat explains fully the bitterness with which you calumniate her.'\r\n\r\n''Calumniate her! oh! that were impossible for the very basest fiend to\r\ndo. But I was wrong to desecrate the word, and say I _love_ her. No, no;\r\nI tell you I hate her, I loathe her; but in spite of hatred, in spite of\r\nloathing, she exercises over my imagination an irresistible\r\nfascination--a fascination you can never feel in that intensity which\r\nhaunts my dreams of early manhood. You knew her not a guileless, artless\r\ngirl just blooming into early maidenhood. But enough of these maddening\r\nmemories of the past. It were better, doubtless, that I never see her\r\nmore, for in my hatred I might kill her. But mark you, Arthur, I _will_\r\nfind my child; she is now the only tie that binds me to humanity; the\r\nonly link that chains me to this mortal coil which men call life. I must\r\nhave my darling child. The day after to-morrow I will return here to\r\nknow where she is secreted; if that be divulged to me, I swear by all\r\nthat men hold as sacred, whether in heaven or earth, to depart in peace,\r\nand leave you to your fate, and Adéle to the vengeance of the Most High.\r\nAdieu.'\r\n\r\n''Farewell. You shall be told all that you require,' said my neighbor.\r\n\r\n''Oh! excuse me,' said Percival, returning, 'where does this door lead\r\nto?'\r\n\r\n''To some room to which I have never had access.'\r\n\r\n''Occupied by whom?'\r\n\r\n''I do not know.'\r\n\r\n'A violent blow, which we had not expected, was given on the door, close\r\nto which we were standing, listening. I instantly retreated to my bed.\r\nAdéle remained motionless as a statue; and when the second blow fell\r\nupon the panels, I cried out most lustily:\r\n\r\n''Who the deuce is there?' mingling therewith, moreover, sundry forcible\r\nSpanish expletives.\r\n\r\n''No one. Excuse me, Señor, I mistook the door.'\r\n\r\n''Well, clear out, and don't do it again!' I retorted.\r\n\r\n''Please show me the way out of this house, Mr. Livermore,' was all we\r\nheard, until after a painful pause the street-door was closed, and\r\nArthur's footstep sounded returning up-stairs. I looked fixedly at my\r\ncompanion; her face wore a deathlike pallor, but a soft, melancholy\r\nsmile played upon her lips.\r\n\r\n''Poor Edmund!' said she, in a sad, soft tone, 'despite the wrongs I\r\nhave endured at his hands, the jealousy he has now evinced is such a\r\nproof of his undying love, that I am almost constrained to forgive his\r\nformer cruelty.' Adéle gave vent to a sigh, and added, with downcast\r\neyes:\r\n\r\n''The world, doubtless, will blame me; they will believe every charge,\r\nscout every palliative plea. For a season, I must endure its frown, and\r\nresign my will to drink the bitter cup of scorn and contumely; for I\r\nhave gone astray, I have sinned against the judgment of my\r\nfellow-mortals; and yet, oh! it were so easy to gain sympathy, were I to\r\ndisclose the secrets of the inner dungeons of my prison-house--that spot\r\nwhich poets sing as blessed--Home! O man, man! there _is_ no place like\r\nhome, but how readily may it be turned into a hell--for--a wife!'\r\n\r\n'I was still weak--nervous; and her words breathed such tones of bitter\r\nanguish, and her whole frame evinced such tokens of emotion, that in\r\nspite of all that I had overheard, tears welled up to my eyelids, and\r\ncompassion overcame my still lurking distrust; her sobs alone broke the\r\nsilence which ensued, and I was never in my life more painfully\r\nembarrassed. Fortunately the return of my neighbor relieved me from my\r\npeculiar predicament. No sooner did Adéle hear him enter the adjoining\r\nroom, than she opened the door of communication, and threw herself upon\r\nhis breast.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\n''Dearest Arthur,' said she, the tears still running down her cheeks,\r\n'how fearfully you must have suffered throughout this long interview!'\r\n\r\n''Oh! fear not, Adéle, all will yet be well. I will protect you and\r\navenge your wrongs.'\r\n\r\n''Fear not?' said she, 'do you think that I dread death for my own sake?\r\nNo, Arthur, death is nothing terrible to me _now_.'\r\n\r\n'Then suddenly appearing to become conscious of my presence, they both\r\nseized me by the hands and overwhelmed me with the profusion of their\r\nthanks.\r\n\r\n''Any one would have acted precisely as I have, under similar\r\ncircumstances. I therefore beg you to spare me from further thanks. But,\r\nmy dear sir, do you feel ill? Madame, allow me to support Mr.\r\nLivermore.'\r\n\r\n'A sudden change came over his features; a deathlike paleness overspread\r\nhis countenance, his eyelids became half-closed, his breathing grew\r\nshort, his hands clenched, and a nervous tremor shook his entire frame.\r\nFor a few moments I feared he was at the point of death. I promptly\r\nassisted him to his couch.\r\n\r\n''Are you surgeon enough to bleed him?' inquired Adéle.\r\n\r\n''Yes, I will not hesitate if you desire me to do so.'\r\n\r\n'We soon divested Arthur of his coat, stripped his arm, and while I went\r\nin search of an impromptu lancet, Adéle prepared the needful bandages.\r\n\r\n''Be quick, I implore you,' said she. 'Once before I saw him as he now\r\nis; there is not a moment to be lost.'\r\n\r\n'Need I confess that the entrance of a guardian angel in the shape of a\r\nskillful disciple of Esculapius would have been hailed by me as an\r\nespecial joy? However, no such angel came, neither was he within call;\r\nso as the danger struck me as imminent, and his condition appeared\r\ngrowing every moment more critical, I argued, without bleeding he would\r\nundoubtedly die, whereas by my attempt, however clumsy, he might rally.\r\nI plucked up my courage to the sticking-point, and stuck my patient. I\r\ndrew several ounces of blood. My fair assistant displayed the most\r\nundeniable, I can hardly say irreproachable, coolness, for really, to my\r\nfancy, she was a little too much self-possessed. As soon as the bandages\r\nwere applied, Arthur's consciousness returned.\r\n\r\n''Ah! thanks, thanks,' said he, addressing me in a low, faltering tone.\r\n'The crisis has now passed.'\r\n\r\n''Over-excitement, doubtless, produced it?'\r\n\r\n''Yes,' said he, 'any excitement is dangerous for one like me. You see\r\nin me a man condemned to death by every member of the faculty that I\r\nhave ever consulted. I dare say you mean kindly, and by that look of\r\nincredulity, you would seek to comfort me.'\r\n\r\n''Well, doctors are often mistaken,' I said.\r\n\r\n''True; but I am convinced their predictions in my case will be\r\nliterally fulfilled, for when this terrible disease of the heart once\r\nlays its hold upon a man, it never relaxes its deadly grasp. But,' said\r\nhe, raising himself to a sitting posture, 'but I _will_ not die, I\r\n_must_ live. One fixed purpose, one great aim sustains me, and I feel\r\nthat till I have accomplished this, the thread of life, frail as I know\r\nit is, strained as I feel it oft to be, still, still I have a firm\r\npresentiment it will hold out.'\r\n\r\n''Arthur, dear Arthur!' broke in the voice of Adéle, as she leaned over\r\nhis shoulder, 'you know after such a paroxysm, repose is necessary. No\r\nmore conversation to-night; strive to calm your nerves, and to enjoy the\r\ntranquil influence of sleep. Do this, I beg, I implore you.'\r\n\r\n'With the docility of a petted child he yielded, and reclining his head\r\nupon his pillow, soon sank into a deep sleep. It was now verging upon\r\nthree o'clock, and at my solicitation Adéle retired to my apartment,\r\nwhile I kept watch beside my patient's couch.\r\n\r\n'The mysterious individual whose conduct had so puzzled me, and to whom\r\nI had been so strangely introduced, seemed to be a man of about thirty,\r\ndecidedly handsome, and of striking mien, of elegant manners, and\r\nevidently accustomed to refined society. His hair, which curled\r\nnaturally, was, however, growing thin; a few deep lines were furrowed on\r\nhis brow, and the corners of his mouth wore, as it were, unconsciously,\r\nat times, a disdainful air, and as he slept I could trace how the fire\r\nof youthful passion had brought his manhood to premature decay.\r\n\r\n'Although the veil of mystery had been rent, my curiosity was only\r\nwhetted, by no means gratified. Who could this man be for whose arrival,\r\naccording to my hostess' account, he had been waiting with such feverish\r\nimpatience? What journey could he have returned from, in such shattered\r\nhealth; and finally, what was this great purpose, on the successful\r\nissue of which, he seemed to stake his all, on which he declared his\r\nlife to hang?\r\n\r\n'Again the undefinable spell that seemed to attach to the fascinating\r\nAdéle, filled my mind with reveries of wondrous interest. What was her\r\npart in this drama that was enacting so close beside me? Was she the\r\nvictim or the enchantress? During the long vigils of that night, I asked\r\nthis question of myself many a time and oft, and yet could arrive at no\r\nsolution of my doubts. The soft, regular sound, produced by her\r\nbreathing, in the next room, the door of which remained ajar--for she\r\nhad thrown herself upon my bed, without removing her apparel--fell upon\r\nmy ear, and proved she slept in all the tranquillity of innocence. And\r\nyet the very tranquillity of that sleep almost excited my displeasure;\r\nfor it seemed to evince a listless, reckless indifference to danger, a\r\nlack of tender, womanly sympathy for suffering and sickness, that might\r\nindeed arise from a heart untouched by any love, save that of self.\r\n\r\n'I was just rolling up another cigarette, when, as the day dawned, Adéle\r\nentered. She was lovely, and radiant with smiles. The closest and most\r\nsagacious observer would have failed to discern the slightest trace of\r\nthe excitement through which she had passed but a few short hours\r\nbefore. She thanked me for my kind assistance, with a bewitching grace,\r\nalmost girlish in its simplicity, and begged me to retire, and take the\r\nrest she felt assured I must need. Before so doing, however, it was\r\nagreed that the door leading to my room should in future remain\r\nunfastened, in case of a recurrence of the danger that had menaced her\r\nthe previous night.\r\n\r\n'Feeling no drowsiness, but rather a desire for fresh air, I mounted to\r\nthe cupola that adorned the roof of our house, and for a couple of\r\nhours I sat there, enjoying the delicious breeze and the picturesque\r\npanorama that lay beneath my feet, and the motley groups that swarmed to\r\nearly prayers up the Cathedral steps.\r\n\r\n'At last, I felt like strengthening the inner man, and determined to\r\nstep down as far as Véroley's, the fashionable café of the city, and\r\nthere to take a right good breakfast. I returned to my room to replenish\r\nmy purse, and to take my dagger and revolver. I found the purse and\r\nrevolver on the shelf where I had left them, untouched, but my search\r\nfor the dagger proved fruitless. Yet with it I had wrenched out the\r\nstaples that fastened the door, and to my knowledge no one had had\r\naccess to my room since that time, save Adéle.\r\n\r\n'After taking my breakfast, and calling for my letters, I paid one or\r\ntwo visits, and ere I returned home, it was well nigh three in the\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\n'I had not been seated long, ere Mr. Livermore entered. He appeared to\r\nhave completely recovered from his attack.\r\n\r\n''Of two evils, the adage advises us to choose the lesser. I would,\r\ntherefore, prefer to appear intrusive rather than ungrateful; so excuse\r\nme if I trespass on your time or your patience. After the generous\r\ndevotion you displayed last night, and after what Adéle moreover has\r\ntold me, I feel I am bound to inform you whom you have thus befriended;\r\nfor, as you have already learned, Albert Pride is not my real name.'\r\n\r\n'I hastened to offer to my neighbor the seat of honor, my magnificent\r\nrocking-chair, not only as a mark of politeness, but thinking that as he\r\nwas about to tell me something, if he were only comfortably ensconced,\r\nvery interesting, he might find himself so much at his ease that he\r\nwould make a much cleaner breast of it.\r\n\r\n'My little surmise proved correct; he accepted my proffered civility,\r\nand proceeded to give me a long and very interesting account of his\r\nparentage and youth. Suffice it to say, that he was a native of\r\nTennessee, and being left an orphan at an early age, had, like thousands\r\nof others, passed through a brief career of folly and extravagance. He\r\nhad become acquainted with Adéle and her family some two years\r\npreviously, and had been married to her about four months, under the\r\nimpression, as he had told her husband on the previous night, that a\r\ndivorce had been obtained.\r\n\r\n'What most excited my surprise, in his recital, was, that while Percival\r\nhad accused her of having deserted him because she deemed him ruined,\r\nArthur told me that she married him, knowing him to be almost penniless.\r\nBut I will give you his own words:\r\n\r\n''I explained to her my desperate position, when she replied: 'It\r\nmatters not; in return for the fortune you have squandered, I will give\r\nyou that which shall produce an income far beyond your boyish dreams.'\r\n\r\n''A horrible suspicion flashed across my mind; I feared her reason was\r\nimpaired.\r\n\r\n'''Adéle,' I exclaimed, 'in mercy, jest not; but explain yourself.'\r\n\r\n'''I will, Arthur; but first of all, I must exact from you the most\r\nsolemn vow, that under no circumstances will you divulge to mortal man\r\nor woman, the secret I am about to confide to you.''\r\n\r\n'At this point, Mr. Livermore checked himself suddenly, as if he had\r\nsaid too much, and then added:\r\n\r\n''I regret, my dear sir, that I can merely add, that I gave Adéle the\r\nsolemn pledge she required, and that my presence here, in the city of\r\nMexico, to-day, is merely the result of the secret then intrusted to\r\nme.'\r\n\r\n'I was still under the impression that this narrative had produced, when\r\nAdéle softly entered the apartment.\r\n\r\n''Arthur,' said she, in a low whisper, 'there is some one knocking at\r\nthe door of the ante-chamber.'\r\n\r\n''Remain here,' said he, rising from his seat, 'I will go and open it.'\r\n\r\n''Do not let him go alone, I beg of you,' said Adéle. 'Who knows of\r\nwhat service your presence may be to-day, or of what value your\r\ntestimony may be hereafter? Possibly, it may save money, if not life;\r\nbut why go without your hat and gloves?' she added, as I was leaving the\r\nroom bare-headed, 'you must pass for a visitor, not for a\r\nfellow-lodger.'\r\n\r\n'Lost in admiration of her ready tact and coolness, I reached Arthur\r\nLivermore's sitting-room, just as he opened the door.\r\n\r\n''Pepito,' exclaimed he.\r\n\r\n''Ay, Caballero, Pepito himself, in perfect health, and ever your most\r\ndevoted servant.''\r\n\r\n\r\n[TO BE CONCLUDED.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCHANGED.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I can not tell what change has come to you,\r\n    Since when, amid the pine-trees' murmurous stir,\r\n  You spoke to me of love most deep and true:\r\n    I only know you are not as you were.\r\n\r\n  It is not that you fail in tender speech;\r\n    You speak to me as kindly as of old;\r\n  But yet there is a depth I do not reach,\r\n    A doubt that makes my heart grow sick and cold.\r\n\r\n  True, there has been no anger and no strife;\r\n    I only feel, with dreary discontent,\r\n  That something bright has vanished from my life;\r\n    I know not what it is, nor where it went.\r\n\r\n  You chide my grief, and wipe my frequent tears;\r\n    But to my pain what art can minister?\r\n  Oh! I would give all life's remaining years\r\n    If you would be again as once you were!\r\n\r\n  As, dipped in fabled fountains far away,\r\n    All living things are hardened into stone,\r\n  So strange and frozen seems your love to-day,\r\n    Its sweet, spontaneous growth and life are gone:\r\n\r\n  And it is changed into a marble ghost,\r\n    Driving away all happiness and rest;\r\n  In whose chill arms I shiver faint and lost,\r\n    Bruising my heart against its rocky breast.\r\n\r\n  Nay, no regrets, no vows: it is too late,\r\n    Too late for you to speak, or me to hear:\r\n  We can not mend torn roses: we must wait\r\n    For the new blossoms of another year.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHAMLET A FAT MAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have seen on the stage several Hamlets, more or less successful in\r\nthat sublime dramatic creation of Shakspeare, to say nothing of\r\nsmall-calfed personifications at private fancy balls. Young Booth, in\r\nthese days, is doubtless the most ideal and accurate interpreter of the\r\ngreat Dane; although Mrs. Kemble's rendition is certainly beyond the\r\nreach of hostile criticism.\r\n\r\nIn this paper I propose to consider Hamlet not as he is represented on\r\nthe stage, but as he is described in the original text. At the theatre,\r\nhe usually appears as a dark-complexioned, black-haired, beetle-browed,\r\nand slender young man, wearing an intensely gloomy wig, eyebrows corked\r\ninto the blackness of preternatural bitterness, while on thin and\r\nromantic legs, imprisoned in black silk tights, he struts across the\r\nstage, the counterfeit presentment of the veritable prince.\r\n\r\nI once read a brief line or two in a work by Goethe, alleging that\r\nHamlet was 'a fat man.' At first I was inclined to regard this as a joke\r\nof the majestic German. Later reflection induced me to examine this\r\nsurmise in detail, and to conclude finally that the theory is true, and\r\nthat the enigma of Hamlet's character can be solved through calculations\r\nof pinguitude.\r\n\r\nEurêka. Perfect tense, indicative mood, 'I have found it!' In fact, the\r\nwhole Hamlet problem must be regarded in an obese, or adipose point of\r\nview. The Prince of Denmark is not the conventional Hamlet of the\r\ntheatre, nor the Hamlet of Shakspeare. He was a Northman, and like the\r\ngreater number of the inhabitants of Northern Europe, was, doubtless, a\r\nblue-eyed and flaxen-haired blonde. My lord was far from appearing thin\r\nor delicate; on the contrary, he carried on his belly a large\r\nportmanteau well-rounded by the swell of the digesting nutriment.\r\n\r\nThat our honored prince was a fat man, is proved by his own confession,\r\nas well as by the evidence of the queen. Tossed about in a hot desert of\r\ndoubt and despair, he exclaims in one of his incomparable soliloquies:\r\n\r\n  '_Oh! that this too, too solid flesh_ WOULD MELT!'\r\n\r\nWhat thin man would melt away even in the hot solstice of June? In the\r\nfencing scene, (Act IV.,) his flabby muscles are soon fatigued, and the\r\nqueen exclaims:\r\n\r\n  '_He's fat, and scant of breath:\r\n  Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows_.'\r\n\r\nHowever, to be serious, it must be confessed that there are splendid\r\ntraits in the mental character of the prince; every grandeur or folly\r\ncan be found in him. From the lowest pit of despair, his soul debates\r\nthe question of suicide as a logical proposition, forgetting the divine\r\nprohibition against 'self-slaughter.' Eloquence, genius, and brilliant\r\nfancies, are constantly manifested, and also a gorgeous imagination.\r\n\r\nIt may be mentioned, incidentally, that Hamlet's character has been\r\ncontrasted with that of Orestes, the Greek, who, when he arrived at\r\nyears of manhood, avenged his father's death by assassinating his\r\nmother, Clytemnestra, and her adulterer, OEgisthus. In other words, he\r\navenged a crime by a crime.\r\n\r\nAnd now let us drop these serious comments, and return to the more\r\nhumorous side of our theory--the plumpness of the prince, overlooked as\r\na mere accident, by critics and actors. It is a physiological propriety\r\nthat he should be of a phlegmatic temperament--a temperament often\r\nunited to an acute intellect, but also, to a sluggish and heavy person.\r\nA weak, wavering inactivity, fickleness of purpose, a keen sensibility,\r\nor sensitiveness, are also noticeable; while the subtlety of his\r\ntheories is sharply penetrating, and forms the keystone to the arch of\r\nhis character.\r\n\r\nTruly, Hamlet's intellect is that of a giant; his strength of will,\r\nthat of a child. He has, so to speak, no executive talent. He is the\r\ndoubting philosopher, the subtle metaphysician, the self-analyzer,\r\nalways 'thinking too precisely upon the event.' He sees so far into the\r\nconsequences of human action that he is fearful of taking decided steps.\r\nHe has the nerve to kill neither his uncle nor himself, although he\r\ndebates the latter question with great dexterity. He never _effected_\r\nany one of the plans upon which he had deliberated. Any one who reads\r\n_Hamlet_, under the influence of this theory, will see that it is\r\nconfirmed by every incident in the tragedy.\r\n\r\nA series of accidents hurried the prince to the final catastrophe. His\r\nwas a lovely, great, and noble nature; but it lacked one element of\r\nheroism--strength of will. It was an exquisite touch in the mighty poet\r\nto make Hamlet gross in figure, as he was phlegmatic, inactive, and\r\nirresolute in temperament. Had he been a thin, brown, choleric, and\r\nnervous man, the tragedy would have ended in the first Act. Had he been\r\na fiery Italian, instead of a doubting, deliberating Dane; had he been\r\nof a passionate, or yellow complexion, instead of a calm blonde; had he\r\npossessed a wiry, high-strung, and nervous constitution; had he, in a\r\nword, proved himself a man of action, and not a man of metaphysical\r\ntendencies, his sword would have soon cut the perplexing meshes which\r\nsurrounded him, and he would have executed instant vengeance upon the\r\nauthors of his misfortune and disgrace. Else he would have put an end to\r\na life too wretched to be endured.\r\n\r\nThe conventional critic may smile at the conceit of a _fat_ Hamlet, but\r\nI am satisfied that my theory is amply sustained by the text, as well as\r\nby the true solution of the alleged knotty points of Shakspeare's mental\r\ncharacter, over which the ponderous but inflated brain of Dr. Johnson\r\nstultified itself. He accuses the Avon bard of introducing spirits,\r\nghosts, myths, and fairies; of being guilty of exaggerations,\r\nabsurdities, vulgar expressions, and other naughtiness. (_Boswell's\r\nJohnson_, Vol. IV. pp. 258, etc.) All of which proves that the Doctor\r\nwas sometimes prejudiced, ill-natured, jealous, and ponderously silly on\r\ncertain points.\r\n\r\nBut they who have cracked the kernel of this grand tragedy, and formed a\r\njust conception of the real disposition and peculiarities of the true\r\nhero, must admire and appreciate the marvelous skill of the great bard\r\nwho understands the relations between physiology and the passions, and\r\ncan analyze the temperament physical, as well as dissect the soul\r\nimmortal.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE KNIGHTS OF THE GOLDEN CIRCLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin a very few years, the friends of Emancipation in the North and\r\nWest, as well as all opposed to the increase of 'Southern power' in our\r\nnational policy, have been from time to time interested by rumors of a\r\nsecret association termed that of the _Knights of the Golden Circle_, or\r\nas it is familiarly described, 'the K.G.C.' It was understood to be a\r\nsecret society, instituted for the purpose of extending, by the most\r\ndesperate means and measures, the institution of slavery, and with it,\r\nof Southern Secession and all those social and political principles\r\nwhich have been of late years so unscrupulously advocated by Southern\r\nstatesmen. It is, however, only of late that any thing definite relative\r\nto this order has been published.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1861, the Louisville _Journal_ gave a full _exposé_ of the\r\norder, which has been recently republished in a pamphlet, by 'the U.S.\r\nNational U.C.,' a copy of which now lies before us. 'Of the authenticity\r\nof this exposition,' says the introduction, 'there can be no doubt.'\r\nGeorge D. Prentice, Esq., the editor of the _Journal_, gives his solemn\r\nassurance, as an editor and as a man, that the documents from which he\r\nderived his information are authentic. He asserts, moreover, that he\r\nreceived them from a prominent Knight of the Third Degree. The\r\ngenuineness of these documents has never yet been denied by any man\r\nwhose word can be regarded as valid testimony in the case. Corroborative\r\ntestimony was furnished in a violent newspaper quarrel which occurred\r\nsoon after the first publication was made, in which several 'Knights of\r\nthe Third Degree' were participants, the question in dispute being as to\r\nthe authorship of the revelations made to Mr. Prentice. After the\r\nwarfare had subsided, he informed them that they were all mistaken, and\r\nthat each one of the parties implicated was equally guiltless.\r\n\r\nOn the first page of the introduction referred to, the editor, after a\r\nsuccinct statement that the K.G.C. is the direct descendant of the order\r\nof the Lone Star and other secret fillibustering societies, and that\r\nmany of the 'old landmarks' of those unions may be traced in its\r\norganization, quotes from an article in the CONTINENTAL MONTHLY for\r\nJanuary, 1862, as follows:\r\n\r\n    'This organization, which was instituted by John C. Calhoun,\r\n    William L. Porcher, and others, as far back as 1835, had for its\r\n    sole object the dissolution of the Union and the establishment of\r\n    Southern Empire--Empire is the word, not Confederacy or\r\n    Republic--and it was solely by means of its secret but powerful\r\n    machinery, that the Southern States were plunged into revolution,\r\n    in defiance of the will of a majority of their voting population.\r\n    Nearly every man of influence at the South, (and many a pretended\r\n    Union man at the North,) is a member of this organization, and\r\n    sworn, _under the penalty of assassination_, to labor, 'in season\r\n    and out of season, by fair means and by foul, at all times and on\r\n    all occasions, for the accomplishment of its object.'\r\n\r\nThe editor of the pamphlet in question declares that he knows not upon\r\nwhat evidence the above statement from the CONTINENTAL is based, but\r\nadmits that there can be no reasonable doubt that these men and their\r\nassociates _did_ resort to secret and powerful means for the spread of\r\ntheir views and for the instruction of the Southern mind in the\r\ndoctrines of disunion and treason which they originated.\r\n\r\nAs regards our source of information, let it suffice to say that we\r\nderived it from a gentleman who was himself a K.G.C., who was familiar\r\nwith its history, and of whose character for honor and veracity strict\r\ninquiries made by us of men of high standing in the community left no\r\nshadow of room for doubt. From his statements, it was transferred by one\r\nof our establishment to the author of the article in question.\r\n\r\nTo the eye of the student of history, who has closely traced in many\r\nages and countries the vast action of secret societies in events, the\r\nwhole Southern movement bears, however, intrinsic evidence of that\r\npeculiar form of hidden political power. The prompt and vigorous action\r\nof the whole Secession movement, by which States with a majority\r\nattached to the Union were hurled, scarce knowing how, into rebellion,\r\nwould never have been accomplished save by a long established and\r\nperfectly drilled organization. It is not enough to sway millions that\r\nthe leaders simply know what they wish to do, or that they have the\r\npower to do it. There must be _organization_ and _subordination_, if\r\nonly to control the independent action of demagogues and of selfish\r\npoliticians, who abound in the South as elsewhere. Had the existence of\r\nthe K.G.C. never been revealed, the historian would have detected it by\r\nits results, and been compelled in fairness to admit that it was\r\nadmirably instituted to fulfill its ends--evil as they were--and that\r\nits work was well done.\r\n\r\nThe editor of the pamphlet has good grounds for asserting that the\r\nK.G.C. embraces among its members thousands of secretly disloyal men in\r\nthe North, and that these are of all grades of society. Let it, however,\r\nbe remembered that previous to the breaking out of this war there were\r\nmany who did not see Disunion as they now view it, and that their ties\r\nwith the South were often of the most brotherly kind. Indeed, when\r\nSecession was first openly agitated, and until Sumter fired the Northern\r\nheart, myriads who would now gladly disown those words were wont to say:\r\n'Well, if they are determined to go, I suppose we must lose them.' Would\r\nFernando Wood have ever _dared_ at that time to publish a proclamation\r\nrecommending the secession of New-York as a free city had there not then\r\nexisted a singular apathy, or rather a strange blindness, to the\r\nhorrible results which must flow from disunion? In those days the\r\ncountry _was_ blind--it has seen many an old error and delusion\r\ndispelled since then--unfortunately too many among us have still much to\r\nlearn! Let those who still oppose _Emancipation_ remember that a day\r\nwill come when they, too, will unavoidably appear as the tories of the\r\ngreat Revolution now in progress!\r\n\r\nOur informant declared that should he write an exposition of the K.G.C.,\r\nit would differ in many respects from that given in the _Journal_,\r\nforgetting apparently, that Mr. Prentice had already explicitly stated\r\nthat since the great question of Disunion sprung up, the K.G.C. had\r\nmaterially changed its character, and must unavoidably, from its very\r\nnature, continue to change and modify details to suit new exigencies.\r\nThe whole history of _secret society_, whether in its forms Masonic,\r\nTemplar, Illuminée, Carbonari, Philadelphian, or Marianne; whether\r\nuniversal, political, social, military, or revolutionary, is a history\r\nof modifications of mere detail, compelled by circumstances. The mere\r\nforms of initiation, the Ritual of the Order, pass-words, grips, and\r\nsigns, are of comparatively small importance, in fact, they appear\r\nsupremely silly; and were it not undoubtedly true that the mass of the\r\ninitiated were correspondingly silly, though very wicked, fellows, we\r\nmight almost wonder that such rococo nonsense should be deemed essential\r\nto the management of a powerful political organization. The weaker\r\nbrethren, unable to penetrate by the strong will and by 'spontaneous\r\nsecresy,' to coöperation with the leaders and to the arcana, have always\r\nrequired the tomfoolery of ceremony, and among the K.G.C. it has not\r\nbeen spared. Those desirous of learning what the forms were or are in\r\nwhich the action of the Order has been enveloped, we refer to pamphlet\r\nitself, premising that, of its kind, it is quite curious, ingenious, and\r\ninteresting. The formula of the Obligation of the First Degree, as given\r\nby Mr. Prentice, shows that the first field of operation, as originally\r\nintended, was Mexico, but that it is also held to be a duty to offer\r\nservice to any Southern State to aid in repelling a Northern army.\r\n'Whether the Union is reconstructed or not, the Southern States must\r\nfoster any scheme having for its object the Americanization and\r\nSouthernization of Mexico, so that, in either case, our success will be\r\ncertain.' The initiation of the Second Degree is unimportant, save that\r\nit declares that the head-quarters of the Organization are at Monterey.\r\nFrom the Third Degree we learn that 'candidates must be familiar with\r\nthe work of the two former degrees; must have been born in '58,'\r\n(meaning a slave State,) or if in 59, (a free State,) he must be a\r\ncitizen; 60, (a Protestant,) and 61, (a slaveholder.) A candidate who\r\nwas born in 58, (a slave State,) need not be 61, (a slaveholder,)\r\nprovided he can give 62, (evidence of character as a Southern man.)' The\r\n'object' of it all is 'to form a council for the K.G.C., and organize a\r\ngovernment for Mexico.' It is to be remarked that a stanch '57,' or\r\nknight of the Golden Circle, is made to swear that he will never\r\ndishonor the wife or daughter of a brother K.G.C., _knowing them to be\r\nsuch_, that he be made to kneel and say his prayers to God, and\r\nimmediately after is requested to pay ten dollars, and to declare that\r\nhe will to the utmost of his ability oppose the admission of any\r\nconfirmed drunkard, professional gambler, rowdy, convict, felon,\r\nabolitionist, negro, Indian, minor, or foreigner to membership in any\r\ndepartment of the Circle.\r\n\r\nAbolitionists are to be found out, and reported to George Bickley, a\r\nmiserable quack and 'confidence man,' a person long familiarly spoken of\r\nby the press as a mere Jeremy Diddler, but who has been a useful tool to\r\nshrewder men in managing for them this precious Order. The member is to\r\ndo all in his power to 'build up a public sentiment in his State\r\nfavorable to the K.G.C., and to aid in the expulsion of free negroes\r\nfrom the South, that they may be sent to Mexico.' Roman Catholics,\r\nforeigners, abolitionists, and Yankee teachers are all to be watched and\r\nreported. In ease of success in conquering Mexico, every thing possible\r\nis to be done in order to prevent any Roman Catholic from being\r\nappointed to any office of profit or trust. 'I will endeavor to cause to\r\nbe opened to the public all nunneries, monasteries, or convents. Any\r\nminister, holding any place under government, must be Protestant.' When\r\nwe reflect on the fact that the Southern system aims at a perfectly\r\noligarchic unity and consolidation of power, this dread of any external\r\npossible influence, whether religious or civic, will appear natural\r\nenough. Mexico is, however, to be the great field of future action, and\r\nMexico must be cleared of its priests. The _peon_ system is to be\r\nreduced to '89,' (perpetual slavery.) The successor of 'quack and\r\nconfidence Bickley' has a most unenviable task. For this Coming Man--the\r\npresent incumbent being occupied with other duties--is expected to\r\nextend slavery over the whole of Central America, with the judicious\r\nsaving clause, 'if it be in his power;' to, acquire Cuba, and to control\r\nthe Gulf of Mexico. Having sworn himself to all this, and much other\r\nnonsense, and last--not by any means least--also taken oath to forward\r\nto Confidence Bickley all the fees of every candidate whom he may\r\ninitiate, the new Knight listens to the following specimen of elegant\r\noratory from the Secretary:\r\n\r\n    'You had better hear the whole degree, and then sign; for unless\r\n    we have your entire approbation, we do not wish to commit you to\r\n    any thing. I am well aware that this whole scheme is a bold and\r\n    daring one, that can but surprise you at first, as it did me, and\r\n    for this reason I beg to state a few facts for your consideration.\r\n    In the rise and progress of democracy in America, we have seen its\r\n    highest attainment. In the very outset it was based on high\r\n    religious principles, and adopted as a refuge from despotism. In\r\n    the North, Puritanism molded it, and went so far as to leave out\r\n    the natural conservative element of all democracies--domestic\r\n    slavery. As a result, we have presented now social, religious, and\r\n    domestic anarchy. From Millerism, and Spiritualism, every Utopian\r\n    idea has numerous advocates. The manufacturer is an aristocrat,\r\n    while the working-man is a serf. The latter class, constantly\r\n    goaded by poverty, seek a change--they care not what it may be.\r\n    Democracy unrestrained by domestic slavery, multiplies the\r\n    laboring classes indefinitely, but it debases the mechanic.\r\n    Whoever knew a practical shoemaker, or a maker of pin-heads, to\r\n    have a _man's_ ambition? They own neither land nor property, and\r\n    have no ties to the institutions of the country. The Irishman\r\n    emigrates, and the Frenchman stays at home. The one hates his\r\n    country, the other adores his. The Frenchman, is a slaveholder and\r\n    a _man_--the Irishman is a serf and an outcast. The South is\r\n    naturally agricultural; and the farmer being most of the time in\r\n    the midst of his growing crops, seeing the open operation of\r\n    nature, his mind expands, he grows proud and ambitious of all\r\n    around, and feels himself a man. He wants no change, either in\r\n    civil, religious, or political affairs. He cultivates the soil,\r\n    and it yields him means to purchase labor. He becomes attached to\r\n    home and its associations, and remains forever a restrained\r\n    Democrat, restrained by moral and civil laws from any and all\r\n    overt acts. He needs and makes a centralized government, because\r\n    his property is at stake when anarchy prevails.'\r\n\r\nThe reader is doubtless by this time well weary of this vulgar trash of\r\nthe K.G.C., which is only not absolutely ridiculous, because so nearly\r\nconnected with most sanguinary aims. Be it borne in mind that the\r\nSouthern character has always been eminently receptive of the puerile\r\nand nonsensical, while the vast proportion of semi-savage,\r\nsemi-sophomorical minds in Dixie, half-educated and altogether idle and\r\ndebauched, has made their land a fertile field for quack Bickleys,\r\nbrutal and arrogant Pikes, and other petty tools of greater and more\r\npowerful knaves. The Order becomes, however, a matter for more serious\r\nconsideration, when we reflect on the number of Northern men who, to\r\ntestify their Southern principles, have become 'Knights,' 'There is\r\nample and positive proof that the order of K.G.C. is thoroughly\r\norganized in every Northern State as auxiliary to the Southern\r\nrebellion.' It has acted here, as is well known, directly or indirectly,\r\nunder different names, such as the Peace Society, the Union Party, the\r\nConstitutional Party, the Democratic Society, Club, or Association, the\r\nMutual Protection and Self Protection. For much information relative to\r\nthese traitors among us, who, whether sworn to the K.G.C. or not, are\r\nworking continually to further its aims, we refer our readers to the\r\npamphlet itself. There can be little doubt that those self-styled\r\ndemocrats who continually inveigh against Emancipation in every form,\r\neven to the condemning of the moderate and judicious Message of\r\nPresident Lincoln, are all either the foolish dupes or allies of this\r\nwidespread Southern league, many being desirous of directly reinstating\r\nthe old Southern tyranny, while the mass simply hope to keep their\r\nrecord clear of accusation as Abolitionists, in case Secession should\r\nsucceed. 'I was a K.G.C. during the war,' would in such case be a most\r\nvaluable evidence of fidelity for these bat-like birds-among-birds and\r\nbeasts-among-beasts. Deluded by the hope of being all right, no matter\r\nwhich side may conquer, thousands have sought to pay the initiation fee,\r\nand we need not state have been most gladly received. It is at least\r\nsafe to beware of all men who, in times like these, impudently avow\r\nprinciples identically the same with those which constitute the _real_\r\nbasis of Secession. We refer to all who continually inveigh against\r\n_Abolition_ as though that were the great cause of all our troubles, who\r\ncry out that Abolitionists must be put down ere the war can come to an\r\nend, and clamor for the immediate imprisonment of all who are opposed to\r\nslavery.\r\n\r\nAnd while on this subject, we venture to speak a few words on this\r\noft-reiterated accusation, that the Abolitionists have directly caused\r\nthis war, and from which they themselves by no means shrink. Whatever\r\ninfluence or aid they may have given, it is now becoming clear as day\r\nthat no opposition to slavery was ever half so conducive to Secession\r\nand rebellion as _Slavery itself_. Had there never been an Abolitionist\r\nin the North, the self-generated arrogance of the 'institution' must\r\nhave spontaneously impelled the Southern party to treason. The exuberant\r\ninsolence which induced the most biting expressions of contempt for\r\nlabor and serfs, was fully developed in the South long before the days\r\nof Garrison; long even before the Quakers of Pennsylvania put forth\r\ntheir protest against slavery, a full century ago. The North was accused\r\nby the Southern wolf of troubling the stream, though its course was\r\ndirectly toward the wished-for victim. It is time that the absurd cry\r\nceased, and that the South be made to bear its own load of guilt. Ever\r\narrogant, chafing at the intellectual supremacy of the North, envious of\r\nits prosperity, despising with all the rancor of a lawless 'chivalry'\r\nour regard for the rights of persons, prone to dissipation, and densely\r\nignorant of the great tendencies to progress which characterize the\r\ncivilization of the nineteenth century, the Southerner has ever felt the\r\nsame tendency to break away, and be off, which a raw, fiery, conceited\r\nyouth feels to sunder wholesome domestic ties. The stimulus was within,\r\nnot from without.\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that the editor of this, in so many respects\r\nvaluable, pamphlet, in speaking of Northern men of influence who belong\r\nto the K.G.C., or its other aids, should have cited under the vague\r\nheading of 'said to be,' the New-York _Herald, Journal of Commerce,\r\nExpress_, 'and a French newspaper' in New-York City, the Boston _Courier\r\nand Post_, the Hartford _Times_, the Albany _Atlas and Argus_, the\r\nRochester _Union_, the Buffalo _Courier_, the Cincinnati _Enquirer_, the\r\nDetroit _Free Press_, the Chicago _Times_, and the Milwaukee _News_.\r\nWhile we entertain no doubt that among the editors of these newspapers\r\nare men who are at heart as traitorous and as Southern as their\r\ncolleagues of any Richmond journal, [we have ourself seen a small\r\nSecession flag paraded on the desk of an editor of one of the\r\nabove-mentioned publications,] we must still protest against any other\r\nthan _definite_ charges, even against men whose daily deeds and\r\nutterances of treason have been of more real service to the South than\r\nall the trash and trickery of Quack Bickley himself. It is indeed\r\ncharged that 'these are the principal names on the lists of traveling\r\nmessengers for those States,' but it should be remembered that such\r\naccusation requires clear proof. With this single exception, we commend\r\nthe pamphlet in question as a document well worth perusal and\r\ninvestigation. The subject, as it stands, appears trashy and\r\nmelodramatic; but be it remembered the Southern mind is prone to trash\r\nand romance, and quacks and adventurers would be more likely to be found\r\nactively working to aid treason founded on folly than would men of real\r\nability.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOLUMBIA'S SAFETY.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Where lies thy strength, my Country--where alone?\r\n    Let ages past declare--\r\n  Nay, let thine own brief history make known,\r\n    Thy sure dependence, where.\r\n\r\n  'Tis not in boasting--that's the poltroon's wit,\r\n    The coward's shield of glass,\r\n  A coin whose surface, silver's counterfeit,\r\n    With fools alone shall pass.\r\n\r\n  'Tis not in threats--these are the weapons light\r\n    Of brutes, and not of men:\r\n  A barking dog's despised; but if he bite,\r\n    Wo to his clamors then!\r\n\r\n  'Tis not in bargains made to cover wrong!\r\n    There open weakness lies;\r\n  A righteous cause is in itself most strong,\r\n    And needs no compromise.\r\n\r\n  Ten thousand bulwarks which should mock the might\r\n    Of armies compassing,\r\n  Secure not those, who hold one human right\r\n    A secondary thing.\r\n\r\n  There are some souls so fearful to offend,\r\n    They lay their courage low;\r\n  And sooner trample o'er a prostrate friend,\r\n    Than fail t' embrace a foe.\r\n\r\n  Safety proceeds from Him alone who lays\r\n    Foundations formed to last:\r\n  This simple truth concentres all the rays\r\n    Of all the ages past.\r\n\r\n  Th' omnipotence of right, its own shall save,\r\n    Though hell itself oppose;\r\n  One faithful Abdiel may fearless brave\r\n    Unnumbered rebel foes.\r\n\r\n  Faith, Freedom, Conscience--these are words which give\r\n    The true metallic ring!\r\n  For these to _die_, were evermore to _live_--\r\n    Man's noblest offering.\r\n\r\n  Rise, then!

Late one evening, not in a great wood,\r\nbut a great city, I fell in with an old couple, a huge, hulking fellow,\r\nnearly eight feet high, with a heavy, loutish air, and the most pitiful\r\nlittle woman you ever saw, hardly taller than his knee. Her arms were\r\nnot longer, than a baby's, and her poor little legs trotted along as\r\nfast as they could, to keep up with his sluggish stride. In a clownish,\r\nlubberly sort of way, he seemed to be taking good, kind care of her.\r\nThey were on exhibition, it appeared, and (their own show being over for\r\nthe night) were going, poor things, to see a certain famous performing\r\nbear.\r\n\r\n'Of course, I went with them. We found the showroom nearly deserted. The\r\nbear, a monstrous fellow, bigger than Samson by half, lay on his back,\r\nhis huge, hairy chest heaved up like a bullock's, and a great paw,\r\nholding lazily on to one of his bars. His owner, quite fatigued, and\r\napparently a trifle in liquor, brightened up when he saw his strange\r\naudience, and at once volunteered to repeat the performance.\r\n\r\n''This animal, gentlemen,' said he, 'is considerable tired, for I've\r\nbeen a workin' on him mighty hard to-day. He knows that he's done his\r\nwork for the night, and I wouldn't go in with him again for a\r\nfifty-dollar bill, but I shall do it, seeing I've got such distinguished\r\ncompany,' and he made a sweeping obeisance, comprehending the giant, the\r\ndwarf, and my humble person.\r\n\r\n'The performance was really quite remarkable; but I was more interested\r\nin observing my fellow visitors. The dwarf looked up with her bright\r\nlittle eyes, and the giant looked down with his great leaden ones, while\r\nthe bear jumped over the man's head, and pretended to fight him and hug\r\nhim, and finally, walking on his hind-feet, stooped down, and took his\r\nhead into the horrid cavern of those great jaws. Out of breath, and red\r\nin the face, the enthusiastic operator wound up by plucking a handful of\r\nlong hair from the flank of the much-enduring creature, and presented it\r\nto us, as a souvenir of our visit.'\r\n\r\n'I say, when he had him in his mouth, it was 'bear and forbear,' wasn't\r\nit?' put in that scapegrace, Tom, who is always doing something of the\r\nsort.\r\n\r\n'Silence! and don't interrupt the court, unless you can say something\r\nbetter than that. Well, let me tell you, I have been in very genteel\r\nsociety, without feeling any thing so human, so catholic, so\r\npantheistical, (in the right sense,) as I did in making one of that\r\nqueer company. The great lout of a giant, with not soul enough in him to\r\nfill out his circumference; the sad little dwarf, with not room enough\r\nfor hers; the poor, patient, necromanted savage of a bear; the smart,\r\nsteely, grog-loving, praise-loving keeper; the curious, bookish,\r\nindolent traveler. Expressions, all of the grand, never-weary\r\nLife-Intention, how widely variant! yet all children, and equally\r\nbeloved, of the Infinite Father.\r\n\r\n'In four of the five cases, it should seem, the creative energy had set\r\nabout to fashion its supposed ultimate and perfect work, and with what\r\nresult? At first blush, the failure seemed most conspicuous in my\r\ncompanions, especially the big and the little one; but a small\r\nintrospection might, perhaps, have disclosed a deeper disappointment in\r\na nobler aim. The bear was the only success among us. He was perfect in\r\nhis line, though sadly at a disadvantage; ravished from his\r\nforest-world, and bedeviled with alien civilization. And note (as that\r\nsplendid prig, Ruskin, would say) with what mathematical accuracy\r\nnature, in her less ambitious essays, goes to the proposed end. The\r\nbee's flight--a specimen wonder--is not straighter than her course. In\r\nher lower business, she needs no backers. Meddling only monsters her. It\r\nis only when she comes to the grand, resulting combination, for which\r\nshe has so long been fussing and preparing--when she tries her hand\r\n('her 'prentice han', I fear,) on man, that she falters, hesitates, and\r\nlastly compromises for something lamentably less than she bargained for.\r\n\r\n'Her apparent purpose seems almost inevitably thwarted by some\r\ninfluence--shall we call it malign? or rather shall we consider (as\r\nperhaps we should in all short-comings) that 'tis only a matter of time\r\nand the comparative degree? a piece of circuition needed for variety of\r\ndevelopment, and, of necessity, to eventuate in forms fresher, more\r\n_prononcés_, nearer perfect than any thing we now wot or conceive of.\r\n\r\n'To my thinking, the hitch is, that just at this point, she has got\r\ncomplicated with the wills and motions of intelligences already\r\nindividualized and eliminated, and forever alienated from her immediate\r\nimpulse. And if this be so, depend on it, the _onus_ of the attempted\r\nperfection comes a good deal upon us. The mighty Mother, unsatisfied in\r\nher fantastic longings, and troubled generally [_Greek: dia to\r\ntiktein_], should be helped and not bothered by her children. We can\r\nremove vexations, can arrange conditions, keep the house quiet\r\ngenerally. At any rate, we can take such care as may be of the smaller\r\nyoung ones, help them up-stairs, or at least keep them from tumbling\r\ndown again--we bigger babies that have crawled or been pushed a few\r\nsteps up the awful stairway of the Inconceivable Ascending-Spiral.'\r\n\r\n'I say, Dick, stop your metaphysics.'\r\n\r\n'You are quite right, Tom, they are threadbare enough; but these happen\r\nto be _physics_. I don't mean such as you had to take last week, after\r\nthat sleigh-ride. Well, I remember feeling this intense communism, this\r\nvoltaic _rapport_ with nature in a like way once before, on seeing a\r\ncovey of strange creatures, Aztecs, Albinos, wild Africans, busied, by\r\nchance, in a game of romps together, the pure overflow of animal\r\nspirits. It was a curious scene. They made eerie faces at each other;\r\nthey feigned assaults; they wove a maze, more fantastic and bizarre than\r\nany thing in _Faust_ or _Freysehutz_. It was the mirth of Fauns, the\r\nmischief of Elves and Brownies. The glee, that lighted up those strange\r\nfaces was not of this earth; but a thrill, pulsated through infinitude,\r\nof that joy of life which wells forever from the exhaustless fountain of\r\nthe Central Heart; a scintillation, from how afar off! of the\r\nImmeasurable Love, of the Eternal Pity; though it seemed hardly more\r\nhuman than the play of kits and puppies, or than the _anerithmon\r\ngelasma_ (the soulless, uncontrollable titter) of the tossed spring\r\nspray, or the blue, breezy ripple, for which overhaul your _Prometheus_,\r\nmaster Tom, and when found, make a note of it.'\r\n\r\n'Well, that's not so bad,' allowed Hepsibah, a good deal mollified.\r\nGreek, I have observed, always has an excellent effect upon her.\r\n\r\n'And it has a good moral, my dears,' said grandmother, 'I always like a\r\ngood moral.'\r\n\r\n'And was the bear always good to him?'\r\n\r\n'Well, my dear, I am sorry to say that he had once bitten off three of\r\nhis fingers. You may think this was proceeding to extremities; but, on\r\nthe whole, I give him credit for great moderation. They will bite\r\nsometimes, however--_me teste_, who once in my proper person verified\r\nthe old proverb, which I had always taken for a bit of unnatural\r\nhistory.'\r\n\r\n'I know; 'been a bear, 'twould a bit you,' eh?'\r\n\r\n'Your customary sagacity, Tom, is not at fault. Yes, the bear bit me.'\r\n\r\n'Dick,' said my uncle, 'it strikes me, all this wouldn't make a bad\r\nmagazine article, if you'd only leave out your confounded speculations;\r\nand Tom, as your cousin says, I wish you _would_ stick a little closer\r\nto your classics.'\r\n\r\n'Cousin Dick!'\r\n\r\n'Well, little No-no!'\r\n\r\n'You tell a real good story.'\r\n\r\n'Do I? then come and pay me for it.'\r\n\r\n'No-o! you sha-a-ant! aeou!! there now, tell us another; tell us about\r\nthe bear that bit you?'\r\n\r\n'There isn't much to tell about that either. It was on a steamer, in the\r\nGulf. On the forecastle lay a stout oaken box, and in it--all his\r\ntroubles to come--was a young bear. In the top of it was an inch\r\nauger-hole, and at this small port the poor devil used to keep his eye\r\nall day so pitifully, that I had compassion on him, saw he would get\r\netiolated, and besought the captain to let him out.\r\n\r\n''Not if I know it,' responded Dux, severely, 'he'd clear the decks in a\r\nminute! We had one aboard once before--a big rascal, in a cage, 'tween\r\ndecks--and one dark, stormy night, he broke adrift and stowed himself\r\naway so snug that we never found him till next day. You may judge what a\r\nhurrah's nest there was, every body knowing this d----d bear was\r\n_somewhere_ aboard, and afraid of running foul of him in the dark. No,\r\nno, better let him alone!'\r\n\r\n'Howbeit, I over-persuaded him. We managed to get hold of a bit of chain\r\nfastened to his collar, bent a line on to it, gave him reasonable scope,\r\nbelayed the bight, and knocked off one end of his box. Out he bolted! It\r\nwas a change from that dark den to the glaring tropical sunshine, the\r\nblue sea foaming under the trades, the rolling masts, and the hundreds\r\nof curious eyes that surrounded him. Sensible to the last, he tried to\r\ngo aloft, but the line soon brought him up. Down he came, and steered\r\nfor'ard. The cooks and stewards, their hands on the combing, filled the\r\nfore-hatch. He made a dive for them, and they tumbled ignominiously down\r\nthe hatchway. We laughed consumedly. Then he cruised aft, the\r\ndress-circle considerately widening. He came up to me, as if knowing his\r\nbenefactor by instinct, looking curiously about him, and curling and\r\nretracting his flexile snout and lip, after the manner of his kind. Now,\r\nI had often dealt with bears, tame and semi-tame, had 'held Sackerson by\r\nthe chain,' as often as Master Slender, had known them sometimes to\r\nstrike or hug, (which they always do standing,) but had never known one\r\nto bite. So I didn't take the trouble to move, and--the first I\r\nknew--the villain had me by the leg!'\r\n\r\n'Sarved yer right, for lettin' on him out,' interposed that grim utilist\r\nJonas, our hired man. He had entered, pending the narrative, and stood,\r\n_arrectis auribus_, by the door.\r\n\r\n'Mercy on us! didn't it hurt?'\r\n\r\n'Yes; but not more than might easily be borne. It didn't seem like\r\nbiting--more like the strong, hard grip of a vice than any thing\r\nelse--puncture quite lost in constriction. My viznomy, I am told, was a\r\nstudy: supreme disgust, tempered with divine philosophy.'\r\n\r\n'And how on earth did you get away from him?'\r\n\r\n'By not trying to; kept as still as a mouse, till he had bitten all he\r\nwanted to, which took about a minute. Then he let go, and walked quietly\r\noff, to see if he couldn't bite somebody else. I afterward improved our\r\nacquaintance by giving him sugar-cane and a licking or two; but he was\r\nalways an ill-conditioned brute, not amenable to reason, and when we\r\ncame to New York, gave no end of trouble, by getting over the side and\r\nrunning up the North River on the ice--I dare say he scented the\r\nCatskills--the whole waterside whooping and hallooing in chase after\r\nhim. Ah! I could tell you a better story than that, of a wild beast\r\naboard a ship!'\r\n\r\n'Do, then.'\r\n\r\n'It was told me by an ancient mariner, who knows how many years ago? for\r\nI'm getting to be an old fellow myself, children.'\r\n\r\n'What nonsense, Dick! talk about _your_ being old.'\r\n\r\n'Well, never mind. I'll try to give it to you in his own words. Said he:\r\n\r\n\"I never see a nigger turn white but once, and that was aboard of the\r\nold 'Emperor.' We was bound from Calcutta, to Boston, and had aboard an\r\nelephant, a big Bengal tiger, and a lot of other wild creturs, for a\r\nmenagerie. Well, one forenoon, blowing a good topsail breeze, as it\r\nmight be to-day, but more sea than wind, we was going large, and I up on\r\nthe main-yard, turning in a splice. All to once, I heerd a strange\r\nnoise, and looked down. There was the black cook, shinning of it up,\r\nmaking a great hullibaloo, and shaking the tormentors behind him--that's\r\na big iron fork he has in the galley. His face was as white as a\r\ntable-cloth. Close behind him was the tiger, who had got out of his cage\r\nsomehow, and, snuffing the grub, had made tracks for the coppers.\r\n\r\n\"All the watch, by this time, was tumbling up the rigging, fore and aft.\r\nThe tiger he tried two or three of the ratlins, but thought it onsafe,\r\nso he let himself down, mighty careful, to the deck. The companion-way\r\nwas open, and he dived into the cabin. The captain lay asleep on the\r\ntransom, and never waked up. The cretur didn't touch him, but come up\r\nagin, and poked his nose into, the door of the mate's room, that was a\r\nlittle on the jar. The mate see him, and gin him a kick in the face, and\r\nslammed the door agin him. That made him mad, and he tried to get in at\r\nthe little window; but his head was so big, he couldn't begin. Did you\r\never mind what eyes them devils has? They've got a kind of cruel,\r\nmurderin' look that no other beast has, that I ever see. Well, he give\r\nit up, and went aft. Then, a kind of a sick feelin' come over me; for,\r\nd'ye see, there was _one_ man that couldn't leave no way!'\r\n\r\n\"The man at the wheel?'\r\n\r\n\"Ay, shipmet! He saw the tiger comin', for he turned as pale as death;\r\nbut he didn't look at him, and never stirred tack or sheet. He stuck\r\nright on to the spokes, and steered her as true as a die; and well he\r\ndid, for if he hadn't, we'd a broached to in five seconds, and that\r\nwould a been wuss than the tiger. Well, the cussed beast went close up\r\nto him, and actually snuffed at him. You may judge what a relief it was\r\nto us when he left him, at last, and come for'ard. There was a sheep in\r\nthe long-boat, and, as he was cruising about decks, he smelt it, and\r\ngrabbed it, and was suckin' its blood in a jiffy; so we managed to get a\r\nslip-knot over him, and hauled taut on it from aloft. Then a young\r\nfellow went down with a line, and wound it round and round him, till he\r\ncouldn't stir, and at last, with a heap of trouble, we got him stowed in\r\nhis cage again, sheep and all; for he never let go on it.'\r\n\r\n\"And what was done for the man at the wheel?'\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, nothing; he was only doing his duty.\"\r\n\r\n'That was too bad! Now tell us another--tell us some more about shows?'\r\n\r\n'Shows, chickabiddy? I've not seen any of late. The last was the\r\nWhat-Is-It.'\r\n\r\n'Well, and what _was_ it?'\r\n\r\n'That is more than I can tell you. The proprietor is constantly asking\r\nthe question, and has even gone to the expense of repeatedly\r\nadvertising. I shouldn't wonder if, by this time, he had gotten a\r\nsatisfactory response. I went and listened to the customary description.\r\nThe silence that ensued was broken by a miserable skeptic, whose\r\nill-regulated aspirations betrayed his insular prejudice, 'Vot is it?\r\narf hanimal, eh? t'other day, I stuck a pin into him, and ses he, '_Dam\r\nyez!_' Vot is it, eh?'\r\n\r\n'Thus did this wretch, by implication, endeavor to unsettle the opinions\r\nof the audience, none too definite, perhaps, before.\r\n\r\n'It is singular the distrust with which a thankless public has long come\r\nto regard the efforts of one whose aim it has ever been to combine\r\ninstruction with amusement. Do you remember an itinerant expedition sent\r\nforth, years ago, by the same grand purveyor? There was a Car of\r\nJuggernaut, you may recollect, drawn by twenty little pigs of elephants.\r\nThat show I also attended, and was well repaid for going. Near the\r\nentrance of the tent was a large cage, peopled with the gayest denizens\r\nof tropic life, macaws, cockatoos, paroquets--what know I?--a feathered\r\niridescence, that sulked prehensile or perched paradisiacal in their\r\niron house. Two youths entered; one paused admiringly. 'Come along,\r\nJack,' remonstrated the other, hurrying him on by the arm, 'them darned\r\nthings is only painted.' He wasn't going to see his friend imposed upon\r\nand his admiration extorted under false pretenses. Not if _he_ knew it!\r\nMr. B---- couldn't do _him!_\r\n\r\n'Painted! Ay, Jonathan--and if Church or Kensett, look you, could only\r\nget at those pigments! could find the oil-and-color men that filled that\r\norder! ah me! what opaline skies! what amethystine day-breaks! what\r\nincarnadine sunsets we should have! The palette for that work was laid\r\nby angels, from tubes long hidden in the choicest crypts of the vast\r\nelaboratory, and those transcendent tints.\r\n\r\n  'Nature's own sweet and cunning hand laid on,'\r\n\r\nPainted! to be sure.\r\n\r\n'For this wicked specimen of infidelity, I was presently overpaid by a\r\ncharming bit of belief. At the further end of the great tent was a case,\r\ncontaining divers wax effigies of eminent personages; the Czar, Prince\r\nAlbert, General Spitzentuyfel--what know I? You may see them any day,\r\n(if you happen to have two York shillings,) at the sumptuous home to\r\nwhich they have returned from those travels. There they stood, side by\r\nside, an imposing company, forever shiny in the face, like Mrs.\r\nWittitterly's page, and with eyes magnificently superior to any thing so\r\nsordid as speculation. All were finely befrogged, and ruched, and\r\nepauletted, and, for the most part, they sported moustaches. It happened\r\nthat I had the latter adornment--a variety then--on my own mug.\r\n\r\nWhile recognizing them--they were old acquaintances--I felt a gentle\r\npull at my skirt, and looking down, was aware of a little _tot_, some\r\nthree years old, who asked, pointing to the counterfeit presentments in\r\nthe show-case: 'Did _you_ come out o' there?' The innocent! he little\r\nknew what an extinguisher he was clapping on me. 'No, sonny,' said I,\r\nlooking down on the little nose, itself a bit of wax, between two\r\npeaches. The soft impeachment proceeded--'Well, where do yer belong? do\r\nyer belong in with the _bear_?' for there was a plantigrade there too.\r\nBut I reckon that will do for bears, this time.'\r\n\r\n'I should think so! They'll be dreaming about 'em all night.'\r\n\r\n'Dick, how much of all this is true?'\r\n\r\n'The whole, barring a few verbal interpolations.'\r\n\r\n'Wal, I've seed shows,' moralized Jonas, 'a good many on 'em; but I\r\ncouldn't tell the yarns about 'em that Mr. Richard, here, does. He\r\nfigurs on 'em considerable, I 'xpect.''\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFUGITIVES AT THE WEST.\r\n\r\n\r\nA distinguished French writer once remarked, that the position of the\r\ncolored race in America includes in itself every element of romance. The\r\nfortunes of this great human family; its relations to the white race,\r\nwith which it is growing up side by side; its developments, its\r\nstruggles, and its coming destiny, must hold in the future an historic\r\ninterest of which it would be difficult beforehand to form an\r\nintelligent appreciation. The political events of the last few months\r\nhave fairly opened this new historic page; and though, for the most\r\npart, its recording lines still lie behind the cloud, the first few\r\nwords, charged with deep import to us and to all men, are becoming\r\nlegible to every eye.\r\n\r\nWe can no longer view the colored race as a mere mass of ignorance and\r\ndegradation lying quiescent beneath the white man's foot, and, except as\r\na useful species of domestic animal, of little consequence to us or to\r\nthe world. We see to-day, its fortunes and those of our own race blended\r\ntogether in a great struggle based on political, moral, and religious\r\nquestions, and leading to a series of events of which not one of us as\r\nyet can foretell the conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe collective romance of the race is now but just opening to us; but\r\nits individual romance dawned upon us years ago. Long as we can\r\nremember, we have heard of one and another of that depressed people\r\nstruggling to escape from an overwhelming bondage. We have known that\r\nsuch attempts were marked by scenes of thrilling interest, by intense\r\nearnestness of purpose, by the most powerful emotions of hope and fear,\r\nby startling adventures, ending sometimes in hopeless tragedy, sometimes\r\nin a dearly-bought success. Before the fugitive lay on one hand death,\r\nor worse than death; on the other, liberty beneath the cold North-star.\r\n\r\nSome years ago, these elements of romance, with the moral principles\r\nlying at their root, were laid hold of by Mrs. Stowe. The wonderful\r\nenthusiasm with which her work was received, the avidity with which it\r\nwas read all the world over, showed how wide and deep was the sympathy\r\nwhich the position of the colored race in America was calculated to\r\nexcite.\r\n\r\nI suppose there are few people living on the border-line dividing the\r\nNorth from the South, who can not recall exciting incidents and scenes\r\nof painful interest connected with the fugitive slave, occurring within\r\ntheir own knowledge, and often beneath their own eyes. During the few\r\nyears when I grew from childhood to youth, in the neighborhood of\r\nCincinnati, I can recall many such incidents. I remember being startled,\r\nfrom time to time, by sorrowful events of this nature that so frequently\r\noccur in Western cities, owing to their close proximity to the South,\r\nand to the continual arrival of steamboats from the slaveholding States.\r\nOnce I remember, it was a family of half-caste children, brought to the\r\nvery levee by their white father. He had made the journey during his\r\ndeath-struggle, hoping to leave his children free men upon free ground:\r\nbut just as he approached the levee, he died; and his heir, in eager\r\npursuit, seized the children around their father's lifeless form, before\r\nthey had time to land, and hurried them away, his hopeless, helpless\r\nslaves. Then it was a woman with a child in her arms, flying through the\r\ngreat thoroughfares of the city, with her pursuers behind her--a mad,\r\nwild, brutal chase. Then it was a pretty mulatto child, the pride and\r\ndelight of its parents, abstracted in the evening by prowling thieves,\r\nfrom a colored family in our immediate vicinity. Lost forever! never\r\nmore to be heard of by its terrified and sorrowing parents! Then came\r\nthe terrible tragedy of that poor mother who, being seized as she was\r\nescaping with her children, and thrown into jail, 'preferred for her\r\ndear ones the guardianship of angels to the oppression of man,' and\r\nkilled them in the prison with her own hands, one by one, the jailer\r\nonly entering in time to arrest the knife as she was about to strike it\r\ninto her own despairing heart.\r\n\r\nBut though from time to time circumstances such as these were noised\r\nabroad and made known to all, I knew that there were innumerable\r\nthrilling stories, often less tragic in their conclusion, known only to\r\nthe more successful fugitive and his own immediate friends. I heard\r\nrumors of an underground railway, as it was termed, a mysterious agency\r\nkeeping watch for fugitives, and assisting them on their journey,\r\npassing them on secretly and speedily from point to point on their way\r\nto Canada. I knew that such a combination existed on my right hand and\r\non my left, and under my very eyes; but who might be concerned in it, or\r\nhow it might be managed, I could not in the least divine. One day a\r\ngleam of light came to me upon the subject. Our minister, a good old\r\nman, who preached with great eloquence on the subject of human\r\ndepravity, and pointedly enough upon many of the sins of the age, but\r\nwho had never taken any clear and open ground on the subject of slavery,\r\nhad a daughter who was warmly and avowedly anti-slavery in principle. We\r\nbecame friends; and as my intimacy with her increased, we sometimes\r\nspoke of the fugitives.\r\n\r\nOne day she owned to me that she had some connection with this\r\nunderground railway, principally in the way of providing with old\r\nclothing the destitute creatures who were arriving--generally at\r\nunexpected moments--barefoot, and with scarce a rag upon their backs to\r\nprotect them from the bitter cold of the Canadian winter, which even\r\nunder the best circumstances is so sadly trying to the negro\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nShe told me that as the agents in the neighborhood were few and poor,\r\nand as these sudden calls admitted of no delay, they were sometimes\r\nunable to provide the required clothing; and she asked me, in case of\r\nsuch an emergency, if she might sometimes apply to me for some of the\r\narticles of which they might be in especial need. From that time Canada\r\nbecame the ultimate destination of all my old clothes. I could imagine\r\nsuperannuated cloaks and shawls wrapped around dusky and shivering\r\nshoulders, and familiar bonnets walking about Canada in their old age on\r\nthe woolly heads of poor fugitive negro women.\r\n\r\nIt was but a short time after our conversation that the first call came.\r\nOne bitter winter's night, word was sent me that a family had\r\narrived--father, mother, and several young children, all utterly\r\ndestitute. The articles which their friends were least able to provide,\r\nand which would therefore be particularly acceptable, were shoes for the\r\nboys, and warm clothing of every kind for the woman. The latter\r\nrequirement was soon provided for. An old purple bonnet that had already\r\nseen good service in the world, a quilted skirt, and sundry other\r\narticles were soon looked up and repaired to meet the poor creature's\r\nnecessities--but shoes for the boys! The message had been very urgent\r\nupon that point. Shoes! shoes! any sort of shoes! Now our boys had, for\r\nthe most part, grown up and departed, and in vain I rummaged through the\r\ngarret--that receptacle of ancient treasures--for relics of the past, in\r\nthe way of masculine shoes and boots. I was giving it up in despair,\r\nwhen suddenly an idea occurred to me. It had happened, in days long\r\npast, that a French lady of our acquaintance had broken up housekeeping,\r\nand we had stored a part of her furniture in our spacious garrets. Ere\r\nlong it had all been reclaimed except two articles, which had somehow or\r\nother remained behind. The first was a handsomely mounted crayon\r\ndrawing, representing a remarkably ugly young man with heavy features\r\nand a most unprepossessing expression of countenance. Below this\r\ndrawing, maternal pride and affection had caused to be inscribed in\r\nclear, bold letters, these two words: 'My Son.' The second piece of\r\nproperty remaining behind with 'my son's portrait, were 'my son's\r\nelegant French boots--a wonderful pair, shiny as satin, and of some\r\npeculiar and exquisite style, long and narrow, with sharp-pointed and\r\nslightly turned-up toes. They were of beautiful workmanship, but being\r\nmade of a firm and unaccommodating material, and in form utterly\r\nunadapted to any possible human foot, they had probably pinched 'my\r\nson's feet so unendurably that no amount of masculine vanity or\r\nfortitude could long support the torture, and with a sigh of regret he\r\nhad no doubt been forced to relinquish them ere their first early bloom\r\nhad departed, or the beautiful texture of the sole-leather had lost its\r\ndelicate, creamy tint. These two articles had long lain in a corner of\r\nthe garret, to the infinite amusement of the children of the family, who\r\nwere never weary of allusions to 'my son,' and 'my son's boots. In\r\nprocess of time the portrait also was reclaimed, but the deserted boots\r\nstill occupied their corner of the garret, year after year, until there\r\nwere no children left to crack their jokes at their comical and\r\ndandified appearance. Upon these elegant French boots I pounced, in this\r\nsore dilemma, and as my messenger was waiting, without time for a\r\nmoment's reflection, I bundled them in with the rest of the articles,\r\nand dispatched them at once to their destination.\r\n\r\nScarcely had the messenger departed than I sat down to laugh. I thought\r\nof the brother, who had especially distinguished himself in his boyish\r\ndays, by witticisms upon those famous boots, and I recalled to mind,\r\nalso, a slightly exaggerated description of the negro foot, with which\r\nhe had been wont to indulge his young companions. This foot he would\r\ndescribe as very broad and flat, with the leg planted directly in the\r\ncentre, leaving an equal length for the toes in front and for the heel\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\nNow, although I had never given credence to these exact proportions, I\r\nstill remained under the impression that there was a peculiarity in the\r\nnegro foot, that the heel was somewhat more protuberant than in the\r\nEuropean foot, and rather broad, it might also well be supposed to be,\r\nin its natural and unpinched condition. The whole scene came vividly\r\nbefore my imagination; the unfortunate family handing round in dismay\r\nthose exquisite French boots, vainly striving, one after another, to\r\ninsert their toes into them, but finding among their number no\r\nCinderella whom the wonderful shoe would fit. I figured them at last\r\ndescending to a little fellow six years old, or thereabouts, whose poor\r\nlittle feet might possibly be planted in the centre of the boots, and\r\nthus, in default of any other protection, be saved for a time from frost\r\nand snow. My mind was divided between amusement at the final destination\r\nof these celebrated relics, and regret that I had nothing more suitable\r\nto send. I could only hope that this part of the poor fugitives' outfit\r\nmight be more successfully provided for from some other quarter.\r\n\r\nWinter passed by; spring came, succeeded by long, hot mid-summer days of\r\nthe western summer. Our neighbors, for the most part, were scattered to\r\nthe North and East--gone to the lakes, to New-York, to Boston, or to\r\nsome summer resort upon the Atlantic coast--all who could, breaking the\r\nlong-continued and oppressive heat by a pleasant excursion to some\r\ncooler clime. My friend, the minister's daughter, and most of our own\r\nfamily, had gone like the rest, and I was left in a somewhat solitary\r\nstate to while away the long hours of those burning summer days, in the\r\nmonotony of a large and empty country-house.\r\n\r\nOne day at noon, I strolled to the door, seeking a breath of air. I\r\nstood within the doorway, and looked out. Before me extended a level\r\ntract of green grass, thinly planted with young shade-trees. At some\r\ndistance beyond, melting away in haze beneath the glowing sun, a little\r\nwood extended toward the north-east, meeting at its extremity another\r\nand denser wood of much greater extent. This first little wood had been\r\nin our young days our favorite resort. We had explored every turn in it\r\nagain and again; we knew well every tree upon its outskirts, beneath\r\nwhose shade some little patch of green grass might serve for a\r\nresting-place, or a pic-nic ground; we were familiar with every old\r\ntrunk with wide-extending roots, in whose protecting cavities that\r\nlittle, speckled, pepper-and-salt-looking flower, the spring harbinger,\r\nnestled, peeping forth toward the end of March, ere the ice and snow had\r\nwell melted, or any other green thing dared show itself. Deeper in the\r\nshade lay the soft beds of decaying leaves, where somewhat later the\r\nspring beauties would start forth, clothing the brown and purple tints\r\nof the ground with touches of delicate pink. With them would come that\r\nfair little wind-flower, the white anemone, and the blue and yellow\r\nviolets, soon to be followed by that loveliest of all Ohio wild flowers,\r\ncalled by the country people, 'Dutchman's breeches,' but in more refined\r\nparlance, denominated 'pantalettes,' looking for all the world as if the\r\nfairies had just done a day's washing and hung out their sweet little\r\nnether garments to dry, suspended in rows from the tiny rods that so\r\ngracefully bend beneath the pretty burden. Pure white are they, or of\r\nsuch a delicate flesh-tint, the fairy washerwoman might well be proud of\r\nher work. Other spots were sacred to the yellow lily, with its singular,\r\nfierce-looking leaf, spotted like a panther's hide, growing in solitary\r\ncouples, protecting between them the slender stalk with its drooping\r\nyellow bell. Later in the season come the larger and more brilliantly\r\ntinted flowers, the wild purple larkspur, the great yellow buttercup,\r\nand the lilac flox. There were dusky depths in the wood, too, into\r\nwhich, book in hand, we sometimes retreated from the mid-summer heat\r\ninto an atmosphere of moist and murky coolness. There we found the\r\nIndian pipe, or ghost-flower--leaf, stem, and flower, all white as wax,\r\nturning to coal-black if long brought into light, or if pressed between\r\nthe leaves of a book.\r\n\r\nThis first little wood, then, though somewhat dark and damp, had its\r\npleasant and cheerful associations; but the wood beyond was weird and\r\ndismal, with its dense shade, its fallen trees rotting in dark gullies,\r\nits depth of decaying leaves, into which your feet sank down and down,\r\nuntil in alarm you doubted whether there were really any footing\r\nbeneath, or if it would be possible ever to extricate yourself again.\r\nThese two woods touched only at one point, included in an angle between\r\na little burying-ground, whose solemn associations increased the gloom\r\nof the farther wood. As children, we had been wont, in adventurous\r\nmoods, to cross one corner of the burying-ground, and striking into a\r\nravine within this wood, down which trickled a little dark stream, wade\r\nup it barefoot, with grave, half-awe-stricken faces, until the stream\r\nsank again beneath the dead leaves, emptying itself I know not where. We\r\nhad given wild and fantastic names to some of the ways and places about\r\nthis ravine, but the rest of the wood was so little attractive and\r\nenjoyable that we generally avoided it, unless in some ramble of unusual\r\nlength, we wished to strike across one portion of it, making thereby a\r\nsomewhat shorter cut into the turnpike road a mile or two beyond.\r\n\r\nAs I stood this hot summer-day looking toward the woods, suddenly there\r\nstood before me a strongly-made middle-aged negro woman. Whether she had\r\nglided round the house, or in what way she had come so suddenly and\r\nquietly before me, I do not know; but there she stood, bare-headed, and\r\nhumbly asking for a piece of bread, or any cold food that I could spare.\r\nHer appearance struck me with surprise; her skin was of a deep, rich,\r\nyellow brown, her face soft and kindly in expression, but wonderfully\r\nswollen, and with the appearance of being one mass of bruises. Her red,\r\ninflamed eyes seemed to weep incessantly and involuntarily; whatever\r\nmight be the expression of her mouth, so inflamed and suffering were\r\nthey, that they were pitiful to see; and to complete the picture, the\r\nstump of one of her arms, which had been severed at some former period,\r\nclose to the shoulder, was but partially hidden by her ragged,\r\nlow-necked dress. Her whole appearance struck me as the most pathetic I\r\nhad ever beheld.\r\n\r\nI speedily brought the poor thing some bread and cold meat, which she\r\nreceived with warm expressions of gratitude; and she then told me that\r\nshe was a fugitive slave, and having come here at night with her\r\nhusband, at the approach of day they had hidden themselves within the\r\nwood.\r\n\r\n'And oh!' she said, 'you would be sorry if you could see my husband. He\r\nis not an old man at all, but you would think he was very old, if you\r\ncould see him; his hair is so white, his face is so wrinkled, and his\r\nback all bowed down. He is so cowed and frightened that he doesn't dare\r\ncome out of the wood, though he is almost starving. We ran away a little\r\nwhile ago, and they caught us and took us down the river to Louisville;\r\nand there they just knocked us down on the ground like beeves that they\r\nwere going to kill, and beat us until we could neither stand nor move.\r\nThe moment we got a chance, we ran away again. But my poor husband\r\nshakes like a leaf, and can not travel far at once, he is so\r\nfrightened.'\r\n\r\nThen she spoke of her bruised face, and said that the sun hurt her eyes\r\nso dreadfully, begging me to give her some old thing to cover them with\r\nand keep off the light. 'It would be such a mercy,' she said, and\r\n'Heaven will bless you for helping us when we are so distressed.'\r\n\r\nI betook myself again to the garret; there were plenty of old bonnets,\r\nto be sure; but, alas! all of them were of such a style that they might\r\nserve, indeed, to adorn the back of the head, but were none of them of\r\nany manner of use to shelter a pair of distressed eyes. While rummaging\r\nabout, I came at length upon something which struck me as just the thing\r\nrequired; it was an ancient relic, more venerable even than 'my son's\r\nboots,' but in excellent preservation. It was a head-dress that had been\r\nmanufactured for my mother, some twenty years ago, before the invention\r\nof sun-bonnets, or broad hats. It was called a calash, and was\r\nconstructed of green silk outside and white silk within, reeved upon\r\ncane, similar in fashion to the 'uglies,' which, at the present day,\r\nEnglish ladies are wont to prefix to the front of their bonnets when\r\ntraveling or rusticating by the seaside; but instead of being something\r\nto attach to the bonnet, it was a complete bonnet in itself, gigantic\r\nand bow-shaped, which would fold together flat as a pancake, or opening\r\nlike an accordeon, it could be drawn forward over the face to any\r\nrequired extent, by means of a ribbon attached to the front. It was\r\neffective, light, and cool, and the green tint afforded a very pleasant\r\nshade to the eyes. I seized upon it and carried it to the poor woman,\r\nwho received it with transport, clapped it immediately upon her head and\r\ndrew it well down over her face. She took up the bread and meat, telling\r\nme with many thanks, that as soon as she and her husband had eaten, they\r\nshould continue on their way, not waiting for the night, as they were\r\nvery anxious to find themselves further from the Kentucky border. I\r\nwished her God speed, and watched her as she crossed the open turf, her\r\nbundle in her hand, and the great green calash nodding forward upon her\r\nhead, until she disappeared within the wood.\r\n\r\nShe had scarce been ten minutes out of my sight when a very unpleasant\r\nmisgiving came over me. That great green calash that she had been so\r\nglad to receive--what an odd and unusual head-dress it was! Surely, it\r\nwould attract attention; it would render her a marked object. If her\r\npursuers should once get upon her traces, it would enable them to track\r\nher from point to point. I wished, with all my heart, it had been less\r\nconspicuous, and I began to think that my researches in the garret were\r\nnot destined to be particularly fortunate. I wished exceedingly that my\r\nfriend the minister's daughter, had been at home, that I might have\r\ntaken counsel with her and have had the benefit of her experience in\r\nsuch matters.\r\n\r\nAs I was still standing in the doorway, ruminating upon the subject with\r\na troubled soul, I saw in the distance the figure of a student of\r\ntheology, whom I knew to be a friend of our old minister and his\r\ndaughter, and thoroughly anti-slavery in principle. I hastened after\r\nhim, told him the circumstances of the case, and imparted to him my\r\nmisgivings. He promised me to put the matter into safe hands, and to\r\nhave a look-out kept for the wanderers. After a few hours he returned to\r\nme with the welcome intelligence that the fugitives had been overtaken\r\non the turnpike road a mile or two beyond, by one of the emissaries of\r\nthe underground railway in a covered cart, in which they had been\r\ncomfortably stowed, and safely forwarded on their way, and that from\r\nthat time forth they would be speedily and quietly passed from point to\r\npoint and from friend to friend, until they reached their destination.\r\n\r\nA weight was lifted from my heart, I could have danced for joy; and I\r\nlearned with astonishment, that the agent, who had come like an angel to\r\nthe relief of the poor fugitives, was no other than a little ugly negro\r\nman, who had often worked in our garden, and who was usually employed to\r\ndo the roughest and dirtiest work in the neighborhood. His crooked\r\nfigure, his bandy legs, and little ape-like head, had always led me to\r\nregard him as the most unpromising specimen of his race that I had ever\r\nbeheld; but from that time forth I regarded him with respect. The poor\r\ncrooked form, distorted by hard toil, contained a heart, and the little\r\nape-like head a brain, to help his outcast brethren in the hour of need.\r\n\r\nAs time passed on, the borders of the wood of which I have already\r\nspoken, began to be invaded by the woodman. Rough, ragged bits were\r\ncleared, and cheap, slight, frame houses sprang up, some of them erected\r\nand owned by the workmen in the neighborhood, some of them put up by\r\nspeculators, and rented to a poor class of tenants. Playing about\r\noutside one of these shanties, a pretty child might soon be seen, a\r\nfair-haired, blue-eyed boy of five years old or thereabouts. So regular\r\nwere his features, so white his skin, it would hardly have been\r\nsuspected that he had any but European blood in his veins, had it not\r\nbeen known that the house was occupied by colored people, to whom he\r\nseemed to belong. An old man was said to be lying ill in the house,\r\nwhich was rented by two colored women, who were anxious to get work in\r\nthe neighborhood, or washing and sewing to do at home. At that time I\r\nwas preparing for rather a long journey; and on inquiring for some one\r\nto sew for me, Sallie Smith was sent to me. When she came, I learned\r\nthat she was an inmate of one of the new cottages, and the grandmother\r\nof the pretty child of whom we have spoken.\r\n\r\nSallie Smith came and went, carrying home pieces of work, which she\r\ndispatched quickly and well. She was a fine-looking mulatto-woman, in\r\nthe prime of life, with wavy black hair and sparkling eyes, though her\r\nfeatures preserved the negro cast. Her manners had a warmth and\r\ngeniality belonging to good specimens of her race, with a freedom that\r\nwas odd and amusing, but never offensive. When she brought home her\r\nwork, with some comical expression of fatigue, she would sink upon the\r\nground, as if utterly exhausted by the walk and the heat, and sitting at\r\nmy feet, would play with the hem of my dress, as she talked over what\r\nshe had done, and what still remained to be done; or related to me, in\r\nanswer to my inquiries, scraps of her past history, her thoughts about\r\nher race in general, her religious experiences, and the affairs of her\r\nchurch in Cincinnati, of which she was an enthusiastic member.\r\n\r\nOn inquiring about the health of her old, bed-ridden husband, I learned,\r\nto my surprise, that he was a white man.\r\n\r\n'You see,' she said, 'he wasn't a gentleman at all; he was one of those\r\n_mean whites_ down South.' As she said this, the scornful emphasis on\r\n_mean whites_ was something quite indescribable. Truly, the condition of\r\npoor whites at the South must be pitiable indeed, to be regarded with\r\nsuch utter contempt by the very slaves themselves.\r\n\r\n'We lived,' she continued, 'in a miserable little hut, in a pine wood,\r\nand I was his only slave. I kept house, and worked for him. He was one\r\nof the shiftless kind, and there was nothing _he_ could do. Oh! he was a\r\npoor, miserable creature, I tell you, always in debt! Well, we had two\r\nchildren, a girl and a boy.'\r\n\r\n'Did he ever have any other wife?' I inquired.\r\n\r\nShe fired up, indignantly. 'No, indeed; I guess I'd never have stood\r\nthat! Well, he was always promising to come to a Free State; but he was\r\nalways in debt, and couldn't get the money to come, and Jane, she was\r\ngrowing up a very pretty girl, and when she was about seventeen, the\r\ncreditors came and seized her, and sold her for a slave, to pay his\r\ndebts.'\r\n\r\n'What! sold his own daughter!' I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n'Why, yes. She was _my_ daughter, too, you know; so she was his\r\nproperty, and so he couldn't hinder them from taking her.'\r\n\r\n'How he must have felt!' I exclaimed.\r\n\r\nShe caught me up quickly. '_Felt!_ why, you know how a father _must_\r\nfeel in such a case. It broke him down worse than ever. Yes, we felt bad\r\nenough when they carried Jane away. Well, she was bought by the\r\nprincipal creditor; he was a rich man, with a large plantation, and a\r\nwife and children, and lots of slaves, and he kept Jane at the house, to\r\nsew for him, and by-and-by she had a child that was almost as white as\r\nhis other children. You see,' she added apologetically, 'Jane didn't\r\nknow it was wrong; she was only a poor sinner, who didn't know nothing.\r\nShe had never been to church or learned any thing, and I didn't know\r\nmuch either _then_. It was only when I came North and joined the church,\r\nthat I began to know about such things. But I grieved day and night for\r\nJane, that I couldn't get her back. Well, for a time we were out of\r\ndebt, you see, and I persuaded my husband to come right up North, for\r\nfear he should get into debt again, and they should seize the boy too;\r\nso we came to Cincinnati, and we got the boy a place there, and he's\r\ndoing very well.\r\n\r\n'There I joined the Church; but I couldn't help thinking of Jane, and\r\ngrieving after her all the time, and I prayed to the Lord for her, and I\r\nprayed and prayed, and by-and-by, I don't know how it happened, but her\r\nmaster let her bring the child and come and pay me a visit. It seemed as\r\nif the Lord had blinded him, so that he did not know that if she came\r\nNorth, she might be free. He was that stupid, he had not the least\r\nsuspicion that she'd stay; he thought she'd come right back to him. And\r\nwhen she did not come, he wrote to her, and wrote again; and when still\r\nshe didn't come, he came himself to fetch her. But I took care to have\r\nJane out of the way, and saw him myself. And he coaxed and persuaded,\r\nand he stormed and he threatened; oh! he was awful mad. But I jist shook\r\nmy fist in his face, and said, 'You ole slaveholder, you, you jist go\r\nback to ole Virginny; you niver git my daughter agin!''\r\n\r\nAs she uttered these words, Sallie compressed her mouth with a look of\r\ndogged resolution; her black eyes glowed with smothered anger, and she\r\nshook her fist energetically in the air, as if the phantom of the\r\nVirginian slaveholder were still before her. After a pause, she\r\nrecovered herself and continued:\r\n\r\n'How he did go on! He cursed and he swore; but it was of no manner of\r\nuse; I'd nothin' else to say to him, and by-and-by he had to go away;\r\nyou see, he couldn't do nothin', because Jane had come North _with his\r\nconsent_. So Jane and I, we came up here, and we get what work we can,\r\nand take care of the child, and nurse the old man. He's miserable! he\r\ndon't often leave his bed, and he's not likely to get much better, for\r\nhe's old and completely broke.'\r\n\r\nSo Sallie had told me her history; but she had not done. Her active mind\r\nhad found an outlet in the little negro church at Cincinnati, of which\r\nshe was a member. Her intense religious enthusiasm mingled with her deep\r\nperception of the wrongs and cruelties inflicted upon her race. Her soul\r\nlay like a glowing volcano beneath that easy, careless Southern manner,\r\nwhich might have led one at first to regard her as merely a jolly,\r\nignorant, negro-woman.\r\n\r\nAt a word which one day touched upon this chord, her work fell from her\r\nhands, her eyes flashed, and she poured forth, in old Scripture\r\nphraseology, her indignation, her aspirations, and her glowing faith.\r\nShe wholly identified her race with the Jews in their wanderings and\r\ntheir captivity, and the old descriptive and prophetic words fell from\r\nher lips, as if wrung from her heart, startling one by the wondrous\r\nfitness of the application. There was such magnetic power in her intense\r\nearnestness, her strong emotions, and her certain and exultant trust in\r\nGod and his providence, that it held me spell-bound. I listened, as if\r\none of the old prophets had risen before me. I never heard eloquence\r\nlike it; for I never witnessed such an intense sense of the reality and\r\nforce of the cause which had called it forth. I can not recall her\r\nwords; but I remember, after describing the cruelty and apparent\r\nhopelessness of her people's captivity, their groans, their prayers to\r\nthe Lord, day after day and year after year, their darkness and despair,\r\ntheir still-continued crying unto God for help, she concluded by\r\ndescribing how the Lord at length would appear for their relief. 'He\r\nwill come,' she said; 'he will shake and shake the nations, and will\r\nsay: 'Let my people go free.' And though there should seem to be no way,\r\nhe shall open the way before them, and they shall go forth free. They\r\nshall sing and give thanks, for in the Lord have they trusted, and they\r\nshall never be confounded.' She paused. Her words made a deep impression\r\nupon me. At that time, how dark and hopeless seemed the way! nothing\r\nthen pointed to a coming deliverance. Blind faith in God alone was left\r\nus; but how cold seemed the faith and trust of the warmest advocate of\r\nEmancipation among us, to the glowing certainty of God's help, which\r\npossessed the soul of this poor, ignorant negro-woman. Sallie took up\r\nher shawl and bonnet, and was about to go. I roused myself, and looking\r\nat her with a half-smile, 'You speak in church?' I said.\r\n\r\nAn instant change passed over her face. Her eyes twinkled a moment, with\r\na shrewd appreciation of my guess. She drew herself up, with a gleam of\r\npride and pleasure; she nodded an assent, and wrapping her shawl around\r\nher, she turned away.\r\n\r\nI have never seen her since; but her truly prophetic words often recur\r\nto me now, when the Lord is shaking the nations; when, if we fail to\r\nlisten to his words, and to let his poor, oppressed people go, he must\r\nsurely shake and shake again. Every day, our concern in the negro race\r\nbecomes a clearer and more self-evident fact. Every bulletin impresses\r\nit anew upon our thoughts. Every soldier laid to rest upon the\r\nbattle-field engraves it still deeper upon the nation's heart.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE EDUCATION TO BE.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Principles and Practice of Early and Infant School Education_.

If, in this conclusion, Beccaria only reiterates an opinion\r\nat least tacitly held long before his time by some of the Grecian sages,\r\nstill, the later assertion of the principle should, it seems, derive\r\nsome additional weight from the circumstance of the time allowed in the\r\ninterim for repeated reconsiderations of the question. The theologian\r\nmay interpose, that, toward rendering a people free and happy, the\r\ninfluences of religion must constitute the most efficacious, the\r\ndominant agency. But when we admit that man is _one_,--that heart and\r\nhand are not only alike, but together subjects for culture,--then it\r\nwill be seen that religion falls into its place in the one comprehensive\r\nscheme of human education; and we discover that Beccaria's position,\r\ninstead of being assailed from this point of view, becomes, according as\r\nour conception of the case is truthful and clear, correspondingly\r\nstrengthened.\r\n\r\nThe ease, however, with which we utter those little qualifiers, 'free'\r\nand 'happy,' observed to stand here in the positive or absolute degree,\r\nand not in any degree of comparison, is noticeable. For 'degrees of\r\ncomparison' are always concessions of steps _down_, even when they most\r\nstoutly present themselves as steps _up_. Were all men simply wise and\r\njust, all predicating of certain men that they were _more_, or _most,\r\nwise_ or _just_, would be at once absurd and without utility. It is our\r\nintensified adjective that confesses fatally the prior fact of a coming\r\nshort, and by an amount indefinitely great, of the simple, absolute\r\nstandard. So, to come once for all to ridding ourselves of comparative\r\nforms of speech, and to be warranted to look for the rendering of a\r\npeople, in the simple, positive sense, free and happy, would be, in the\r\nexpressive language of one 'aunt Chloe' respecting the 'glory' to which\r\nshe aspired, 'a mighty thing!' On the other hand, so far have our race,\r\nup to this moment, and without a single decided instance in exception,\r\nfallen short of aught that could be styled a perfect method of\r\neducation, and so closely must educational training affect every nascent\r\nman or woman in those vitalest particulars,--character and\r\ncapability,--that, could the perfect method sought once be brought into\r\neffective operation on the plastic child-manhood of a nation, or of all\r\nnations, we are not prepared to deny the possibility of any results\r\ntherefrom to humanity, even the grandest utterable or conceivable.\r\nAdmitting such method found, and in process, Beccaria could have\r\ndispensed with his tell-tale 'most,' and written, The certain means of\r\nrendering a people free and happy, is, to establish a perfect method of\r\neducation.\r\n\r\nTo secure, therefore, so great an end: First, find--the perfect\r\neducational method! The recipe is brief; the labor it imposes is more\r\nthan Herculean. To measure it, we should have to find the ratio in\r\nwhich mind transcends matter, or that in which the broad generalizations\r\nof genius in the materials of science surpass the poor conceptions that\r\nthe wild Australian must almost utter audibly in his own ear to realize\r\nthat he at all possesses them.\r\n\r\nIn the 5,865 years which the most unquestioned belief accords to the\r\nhistory of man on our planet, could we suppose the average duration of\r\nlife throughout equal to that of a generation now, there would have been\r\ntime for 177 generations of working, planning, inventive men--of men\r\ndesiring at each period the best they could conceive of, and framing the\r\nbest schemes they were capable of to attain it. Here has been space for\r\nthe slow rise and fall of nation after nation,--vast solitary tides\r\nheaving at long intervals the face of a wide, living, sullen sea: and\r\nhistory reports that the nations have actually risen, flourished, and\r\nfallen. Here has been space for exquisite triumphs of art; for the late\r\nbirth, and nevertheless large progress, of the sciences concerned about\r\nphenomena of physical nature; the art triumphs have been achieved, and\r\nthe germs of sciences are in our possession. Here has been space for the\r\nmultiplication, upon all imaginable themes, of books, to a number and\r\nvolume utterly beyond the powers of the most prolonged and assiduous\r\nlife even to peruse; and the books crowd our alcoves, and meet us\r\nwherever men are wont to make their abode or transit. Here has been\r\nspace for the organization, though so long impracticable and late\r\nconceived, of a system of daily diffusion of intelligence, and to such a\r\npitch as almost to bring the world freshly photographed to our eyes with\r\neach returning sun; and, lo! the photographs are here; they await us at\r\nthe breakfast or the counting table. Here has been space for the\r\nspringing up among the people, at distances of years or centuries, of\r\nprofound educating intellects, marked by clear insight, large human\r\nlove, and patient self-sacrifice, and contributing to the growth of\r\nhumanity by worthy examples, and by propounding successively more and\r\nmore rational modes for the informing and developing of youthful minds;\r\nand, see! Confucius, Socrates and Plato, Petrarch, Bacon, Comenius,\r\nPestalozzi, Père Girard, Arnold of Rugby, and Horace Mann--to make no\r\nmention of many co-laborers among the dead, and earnest successors among\r\nthe living--stepping from their niches in the vanishing corridors of\r\nhistory, lay at our feet the treasures accumulated through their patient\r\nand clear thought and their faithful experience.\r\n\r\nWill it then readily be believed--and yet it is unquestionably\r\ntrue--that, to this hour, neither the schools nor the teachers can be\r\nfound that are in possession and practice of a well-defined, positively\r\nguiding, and always trustworthy _method_ of intellectual, and other\r\nmeans and steps by which to conduct and consummate the education of our\r\nchildren? Note, we do not here declare the want of the true and\r\nuniversal method of educating, if there can be such a thing; but we\r\ndistinctly assert that no school and no living teacher employs or\r\nconforms to any well-defined, positive, and, in and for its purposes,\r\ncompleted method of educating the young; nor, since this latter is a\r\nsupposition better pleasing certain critically-minded gentlemen, have we\r\nin anything like clear delineation and positive practice the _several_\r\nmethods that may be imagined requisite for minds of varying bent and\r\ncapacity. If we sum up in one word the most pervading, constant, and\r\nobvious characteristic of our schools, and of the teaching and the\r\nlearning in them to this day, that word must be, _immethodical_.\r\nAlthough admitting that the education of the young should distinctly\r\nembrace the four departments of a training, _physical_, _intellectual_,\r\n_moral_, and _social_, yet, for the sake of clearness in our discussion\r\nand its results, not less than through the necessities of a restricted\r\nspace, we shall here confine our remarks wholly to education in its\r\nintellectual aspect.\r\n\r\nTo move, for each subject, and for each part of it essayed, always along\r\nthe right way, and by the true character and order of steps,--that is\r\nthe thing to be desired, and which is, as yet, unattained. As a\r\nconsequence, the prosecution of studies is by attempts and in ways that\r\nare generally imperfect, at best make-shift or provisional, often\r\nradically erroneous or worthless. Doubtless, the defects in method are\r\nnow less glaring and influential at the two extremes of the\r\nsensibly-conducted infant school, and the well-appointed and leisurely\r\ncollegiate course. There is no true study that is not what the origin of\r\nthe word implies--STUDIUM, a work of _zeal, fondness, eager desire,\r\nvoluntary endeavor, interest_. Such study has two essential\r\ncharacteristics; where these are wanting, study does not exist; the\r\nappearance of it is a sham; and though results disconnected and partial\r\nare attained, real acquisition is meager, and apparent progress\r\ndeceptive.\r\n\r\nOf these characteristics, the first is what the word directly\r\nexpresses--zealous exertion on the part of the student's own\r\nintellectual powers, a zeal literally pre-venting all other incentives,\r\nor, at the least, subordinating them, through pure love of finding out\r\nthat which is new and curious, or true. In two words, this first\r\nessential of study, and fraught with all the desirable results of study,\r\nis genuine INTELLECTUAL WORK. It is the _nisus_ of the intelligent\r\nprinciple to bring itself into ascertained and well-ordered relations\r\nwith the facts, agencies, and uses of nature, alike in her physical and\r\nspiritual domains. The bright-minded boy or girl who may not comprehend\r\nthe feeling or thought when so uttered, nevertheless _knows_ it, and,\r\nfor his or her range of effort, as keenly as does the adult explorer.\r\n\r\nBut, when a mind thus _works_, the truth that it can never advance\r\nbeyond missing or unfound links in the chain of thought does not need to\r\nbe taught to it. The impossibility of so doing has become a matter of\r\nexperience and of certain conviction. The mathematician knows, that,\r\nbeyond that form of his equation containing an actual mis-step, or a\r\npositively irresoluble expression, all subsequent forms or values\r\ninvolving that step or expression are vitiated, and the results they\r\nseem to show substantially worthless. Now, every actually working mind,\r\nand at every stage, from schoolboy perplexities over algebraic signs, up\r\nto philosophic ventures in quest of one remove further of solid ground,\r\nin respect to the interrelations of physical forces, or the law of\r\ndevelopment of organized forms, finds itself in precisely the\r\npredicament of the mathematician: it feels no footing and accomplishes\r\nno advance beyond that link in the chain of fact and thought, which, to\r\nits comprehension, stands as uncertain, erroneous, wanting, or\r\ninexplicable. This is so from the very nature of our knowing faculties\r\nand of knowledge. The true intellectual worker, encountering\r\ninterruption through any of these conditions, goes back to view his\r\ndifficulty from a better vantage ground, or attempts to approach it from\r\neither side, or, failing these resources, bows to the necessity, and\r\nsuffers no harm, other than stoppage and loss of time. Thus, the second\r\ncharacteristic of true study is in the rigidly natural and unfailing\r\nCONSECUTION of the steps and processes by which the intellectual advance\r\nis made. A mind so advancing never flatters itself of being able to\r\ngrasp that which, in the nature of knowledge, must be a consequent\r\ntruth, until the antecedent or antecedents german to the question in\r\nhand have first been possessed by it. But in our schools, how vastly\r\nmuch is _supposed_ to be taught, in which consequents come before\r\nantecedents, or are promiscuously jumbled up with them, or assert\r\nthemselves, without so much as the grace to say to antecedents of any\r\nsort, 'By your leave.' Obviously, however, such could not be the\r\ncharacter of so much of our teaching, did not the character of most of\r\nour books for schools exactly correspond with it. And the books do\r\ncorrespond: they not only give to a faulty teaching its cue, but, now\r\nthat the _theory_ of education is being so much discussed, and in good\r\ndegree improved, they constitute one of the most influential causes of\r\nthe almost hopeless lagging of its practice.\r\n\r\nNow, how is it that pupils get on at all with such lessons and such\r\nbooks? The explanation is a simple one; but the consequences it is\r\nfraught with are not trifling. The simple fact is, pupils are not yet\r\nallowed to _study_ (in the best sense and manner of that process) the\r\nsubjects they are prosecuting. When, now, they undertake in earnest to\r\nstudy, they are but too constantly confused and delayed by the no-method\r\nof the treatises they are being carried through. In a course of earnest\r\nintellectual work, the pupil must too often, with his present aids,\r\nbecome aware of absence of comprehension; he is ever and anon brought to\r\nstand still and cast about for the unsupplied preliminary facts and\r\ntruths, for the unhinted hypotheses and inferences, which his situation\r\nand previous study do not enable him to supply, but which are necessary\r\nto a _comprehension_ of the results set down for him to deal with.\r\nBarren results, _per se_, our learners are now too much required to\r\ningest; and such they are expected to assimilate into intellectual life\r\nand power! As well feed a boy on bare elements of tissue--carbon,\r\nsulphur, oxygen, and the rest; or, yet more charitably, dissect out from\r\nhis allowance of tenderloin, lamb, or fowl, a due supply of ready-made\r\nnerve and muscular fiber, introduce and engraft these upon the nerve and\r\nmuscle he has already acquired, and then assure our _protegé_, that, as\r\nthe upshot of our masterly provision for his needs, we expect him to\r\nbecome highly athletic and intellectual--that so he is to evolve larger\r\nstreams of muscular energy and more vivid flashes of spiritual force!\r\n\r\nAs it is, we too nearly put the pupil's intellect asleep by our false\r\nmethod; and he endures it because of his unnatural condition. He thinks\r\nhe 'gets on' with it; and in an imperfect way and degree does so.\r\nRarely, we find, does such a one get so far as into the 'conics;' and he\r\nis not certain to be in the habit of reading reviews: if we were sure,\r\nhowever, that he could comprehend and would meet with our simile, we\r\nwould say to him, that the tardy inclination up which he now plods\r\npainfully, must, if graphically represented, be shown by an oblique line\r\n_descending_, in fact, below the curve of his possibilities, more\r\nrapidly even than it _ascends_ above the horizontal cutting through the\r\npoint of his setting out. True, with pupils who are spontaneously\r\nactive-minded from the first, or who at some point in their course\r\nbecome positively awakened to brain-work, very much of the repressive\r\ninfluence of imperfect methods is prevented or overcome. The number of\r\nthose so fortunate is doubtless small in the comparison. The few who\r\n_would_ know, by a necessity as imperative as that by which they _must_\r\nfeed, and sleep, and probably toil with hands or head for subsistence,\r\nare able to supplement many of the deficiencies, and supersede some\r\nerroneous processes of our methods, by the play of their own powers of\r\ninvestigation upon and about their subject. To these, a false method can\r\nbring perplexity and delay, but not repression nor veritable\r\nintellectual torpor.\r\n\r\nWe assert, then, that from a course or manner of instruction from which\r\nthose characteristics of true study--real work of the learner's\r\nfaculties, and a just consecution of steps--are largely omitted or\r\nexcluded, the best sort of intellectual education can not, in the\r\nmajority of instances, accrue. On the other hand, the method embodying\r\nthese characteristics must present that unity, certainty, and guiding\r\nforce hinted at in the outset. Concisely summed up, it is a method\r\nproceeding throughout by discovery, or, as we may say, by _re-discovery_\r\nof the truths and results to be acquired in each department of knowledge\r\nundertaken by the learner. In the absence of the one true method of\r\nintellectual advance, what should we expect but a confusion of clashing,\r\nimperfect, or tentative processes of instruction? He who could, to-day,\r\nciceroned by some pedagogic Asmodeus, visit one hundred of our schools,\r\nor listen successively to a recitation on a given topic, conducted by\r\none hundred qualified and faithful instructors, would find the methods\r\nand no-methods of introducing to the century of classes the truths of\r\nthis self-same subject to be--and we do not mean in the personal\r\nelement, which ought to vary, but in the radical substance and order of\r\nthe theme--quite as numerous as the workmen observed; in fact, a\r\nconflicting and confusing display. Now, do causes, in any realm of\r\nbeing, forbear to produce fruit in effects? Are the laws of psychologic\r\nsequence less rigid and certain than those laws of physical sequence\r\nwhich determine in material nature every phenomenon, from planet-paths\r\nin space to the gathering of dew-drops on a leaf? If it were so, falsity\r\nor confusion in intellectual method might be pronounced a thing of\r\ntrifling import, or wholly indifferent. But such suppositions are the\r\nseemings only of postulates floating through the brains of Ignorance or\r\nUn-heed, who really postulate nothing at all. If, on the contrary, we\r\nadmit this inflexible relation of cause and result in the mental, as\r\nwell as in the material world, and if we admit also that our\r\nschool-methods are yet fragmentary, varying and tentative, then we are\r\ncompelled to the conclusion, that at least the greater number of our\r\nschools are falling short, in the time and with the outlay invested, of\r\ndoing their best and largest work, while in very many of our schools\r\nthere must be steadily going forward a positive and potent\r\nmis-education!\r\n\r\nIf it be urged that these are in a degree deductive conclusions, let\r\nthem be submitted to the test of fact. At least two important\r\ncircumstances, it is admitted, will come in to complicate the inquiry:\r\nfirst, one purpose of school training is to divert the forming mind in a\r\ndegree from sense toward thought, the latter being a less observable\r\nsort of product than that curiosity and store of facts attendant on\r\nactivity of the merely perceptive powers; secondly, there is the growing\r\nabsorption of the mental powers with increase of age in the practical,\r\nin meeting the necessities of life, which more and more displaces\r\nintellectual activity as a set pursuit, and leaves it to be manifested\r\nrather in the means than the ends, rather in the quality than in the\r\nproducts of one's thinking, and, at the best, rather as an embellishment\r\nthan as the business of a career. And yet, in the mind which has passed\r\nthrough a proper school-training, there should be apparent certain\r\ndecided qualities and results, which are manifested as, and as often as,\r\nopportunity for their exercise presents itself. The schooled mind should\r\nsurely not possess a less active curiosity to observe and to know than\r\ndid the same mind before entering school, but even a stronger, more\r\nself-directed, purposive and efficient zeal in such direction.\r\nIntellectual vivacity and point, clearness of conception, and\r\ntruthfulness of generalization and of inference,--all these should\r\nappear in more marked degree, along with the increased sobriety and\r\njudgment, and the improved facility of practical adaptation, which\r\nproperly characterize maturity of mind and habit. Now, we suggest the\r\ncareful observation of any number of children, not yet sent to school,\r\nand that are favored with ordinarily sensible parents, and ordinarily\r\nhappy homes; and then, the equally careful study of a like number who\r\nhave just emerged from their school course, or have fairly entered on\r\nthe business of life; and we warn the really acute and discriminating\r\nobserver to look forward (in the majority of instances) to a\r\ndisheartening result from his investigation! We are convinced that the\r\nnet product of our immensely expansive, patient, and ardently sought\r\nschooling will, in a large proportion of all the cases, be found to\r\nconsist in the imperfect acquirement and uncertain tenure of knowledge,\r\nupon a few rudimentary branches, often without definite understanding or\r\nhabit of applying even so much to its uses, and usually without the\r\nconception or desire to make it the point of departure for life-long\r\nacquisition; and all this accompanied, too often, with actual loss of\r\nthat spontaneous intellectual activity which began to manifest itself in\r\nthe child, and which should have been fruiting now in, at the least,\r\nsome degree of sound and true intellectuality. So, we are still left to\r\nexpect mainly of Nature not only the germs of capacity, but the maturing\r\nof them; the latter, a work which Education surely ought to be competent\r\nto. Meanwhile, like a wearied and fretted pedagogue, Education complains\r\nof the bad materials Nature gives her, when she ought to be questioning\r\nwhether she has yet learned to bring out the excellence of the material\r\nshe has.\r\n\r\nIs it not an expensive process, that thus amasses a certain quantity of\r\nknowledge at cost of the disposition, sometimes of the ability, to add\r\nto it through the whole of life? Really, schooling is short, and,\r\ncontrasted with it, life is long; but what mischiefs may not the latter\r\nexperience from the former! Let us clearly conceive, once, the aversion\r\nmany of our boys and girls persistently feel toward the school, and of\r\ntheir leaving it, at the last, with rejoicing! Are we astonished that\r\nwhen they have fairly escaped, frivolity is, with the young woman, too\r\napt to replace mental culture, and with the young man, vulgarity or\r\nexclusive living for 'the main chance?' That the men and women so\r\neducated are too receptive, credulous, pliant and unstable; that in too\r\nlarge a degree they lack discrimination, judgment, and the good sense\r\nand executive talent which plan understandingly, and work without\r\nsacrifice of honor, manhood, or spiritual culture, to a true success?\r\nBut, if our instructors could find out, or if some other could find out\r\nfor them, _just how_ and _by what steps_ it is that the young mind\r\nengages with nature and harvests knowledge, and if they should see,\r\ntherefore, how to strike in better with the current of the young,\r\nknowing and thinking, to move with it, enlarge, direct and form it\r\naright, properly insuring that the mind under their charge shall do its\r\nown work, and hence advance by consecutive and comprehended steps, we\r\nask with confidence whether much of the notorious short-comings now\r\nmanifest in the results of our patient efforts might not be replaced by\r\nan approach toward an intellectual activity, furnishing, completeness,\r\nand bent, more worthy of the name and the idea of education? We are not\r\nalone in questioning the tendencies of existing methods. Other pens have\r\nraised the note of alarm. Speaking on the character of the _product_ of\r\nthe English schools, Faraday says, 'The whole evidence appears to show\r\nthat the _reasoning faculties_ [mark, it is here the failure occurs, and\r\nhere that it shows itself], in all classes of the community, are very\r\nimperfectly and insufficiently developed--_imperfectly, as compared with\r\nthe natural abilities, insufficiently, when considered with reference to\r\nthe extent and variety of information with which they are called upon to\r\ndeal_.' Does not this strong language find equally strong warrant in\r\ncurrent facts of individual conduct and of our social life?\r\n\r\nThat there is yet no recognized complete method in, and no ascertained\r\nscience of education, the latest writings on the subject abundantly\r\nreiterate and confirm. The best of our annual School Reports, and the\r\nmost recent treatises,--among which, notwithstanding the abatement we\r\nmust make for their having been, through adventitious circumstances,\r\npushed in our country to a sudden and not wholly merited prominence,\r\nSir. Spencer's republished essays may be named,--while they acknowledge\r\nsome progress in details, disclose an undertone of growing conviction of\r\nthe incompetency and unsatisfactoriness of our present modes of teaching\r\nand training. The Oswego School Report, speaking of primary education,\r\ntells us 'There has been too much teaching by formulas;' and that 'We\r\nare quite too apt, in the education of children, to \"sail over their\r\nheads,\" to present subjects that are beyond their comprehension,' etc.\r\nIts way of escape 'out of the rut' is by importation into our country of\r\nthe object-lesson system, as improved from the Pestalozzian original\r\nthrough the labors of Mr. Kay, now Sir J.K. Shuttleworth, and his\r\nco-laborers, of the Home and Colonial Infant and Juvenile School\r\nSociety, London. In the report of Mr. Henry Kiddle, one of the four\r\nmaking up the collective School Report of the City of New York for 1861,\r\nthe radical error of our present teachers is very forcibly\r\ncharacterized, where the danger of the teachers is pointed out as that\r\nof becoming 'absorbed in the mechanical routine of their office, losing\r\nsight of the _end_ in their exclusive devotion to what is only the\r\n_means--teaching the_ THING, _but failing to instruct the_ PERSON--eager\r\nto pour in knowledge, but neglecting to bring out mind.' Is there not\r\nindicated in these words a real and a very grave defect of the manner in\r\nwhich subjects are now presented, studied, recited, and finished up in\r\nour schools? We think there is. And then, what is the effect of this\r\nstudy and teaching, with so much less thought toward the _end_ than\r\nabout the _material_?--what the result of this overlooking of the mind,\r\nthe individuality, the person?--what the fruitage, at last, of having\r\ngiven so much time to the 'finishing up' of arithmetic, geography, and\r\nthe rest, as to have failed _to bring out the mind_ that was dealing\r\nwith these topics, and is hereafter to have so many others to deal with?\r\nThe physiologists have to tell us of a certain ugly result, occurring\r\nonly in rare instances in the _bodily_ organization, such that in a\r\ngiven young animal or human form the developing effort ceases before\r\ncompletion of the full structure; the individual remaining without\r\ncertain fingers or limbs, sometimes without cranium or proper brain.\r\nThey name this result one of 'arrest of development.' Is it not barely\r\npossible that our studies and recitations are yet in general so\r\nmal-adapted to the habitudes of the tender brain and opening faculties\r\nof childhood, as not merely often to allow, but even to inflict on the\r\nintellectual and moral being of the child a positive arrest of\r\ndevelopment? And if it be possible, what question can take precedence of\r\none concerning the means of averting such a mischief? Pestalozzi\r\nintuitively saw and deeply felt the existence of this evil in his day,\r\nwhen, we may admit, it was somewhat more glaring than now. But Mr.\r\nSpencer truly characterizes Pestalozzi as, nevertheless, 'a man of\r\n_partial_ intuitions, a man who had occasional flashes of insight,\r\nrather than a man of systematic thought;' as one who 'lacked the ability\r\nlogically to co-ordinate and develop the truths he from time to time\r\nlaid hold of;' and, at the same time, he accredits the great modern\r\nleader with a true idea of education, 'the due realization of [which]\r\nremains to be achieved.' How doubly important every rational attempt to\r\nachieve such realization--every well-considered effort to improve the\r\nmethod of the studies and the lessons--becomes but too apparent when we\r\nnote the early age at which, as a rule, pupils must leave the schools,\r\nand the consequent brief space within which to evoke the faculties and\r\nto establish right intellectual habitudes. As an illustration drawn from\r\nthe cities, where of course the school period is soonest ended, take the\r\nincidental fact disclosed by Mr. Randall in the New York School Report,\r\nthat in that city the course of studies must be so framed as to allow of\r\nits completion, with many, at the preposterously early age of _fourteen\r\nyears_--really the age at which study and mental discipline in the best\r\nsense just begin to be practicable!\r\n\r\nIn all directions, in the educational world, we are struck with the\r\nfeeling and expression of a great need, though the questions as to just\r\nwhat it is, and just how to be met, have not been so distinctly\r\nanswered. Let us agree with Mr. Currie, that 'Practical teaching can not\r\nbe learned from books, even from the most exact \"photographing\" of\r\nlessons: it must be learned, like any other art or profession, by\r\nimitation of good models, and by practice under the eye of a master.'\r\nYet it is true, however paradoxical the statement may appear, that\r\npractical teaching will gain quite as much when the school-books shall\r\nhave been cast into the right form and method, as when all the teachers\r\nshall have been obliged to imitate good models, in a system of sound\r\nnormal and model schools. What has given to the teaching of geometry its\r\ncomparatively high educating value through centuries, and in the hands\r\nof teachers of every bent, caliber, and culture? What but the well-nigh\r\ninevitable, because highly perfected and crystalline method of one\r\nbook--_Euclid's Elements_? Doubtless we want 'live' men and women, and\r\nthose trained to their work, to teach: quite as imperatively we then\r\nwant the right kind of text-books, in the pupils' hands, with which to\r\ncarry forward their common work. If mind is the animating _spirit_, and\r\nknowledge the shapeless _matter_, still method--and to the pupil largely\r\nthe method of the books--is the organizing force or _form_ under which\r\nthe knowledge is to be organized, made available and valuable. We shall\r\nsuffer quite as much from any lack of the best form, as through lack of\r\nthe best matter, or of the most earnest spirit. In education, the\r\nteacher is the fluent element, full of present resources; the book\r\nshould be the fixed element, always bringing back the discursive\r\nfaculties to the rigid line of thought and purpose of the subject. We\r\nhave now the fluent element in better forwardness and command than the\r\nfixed. We have much of the spirit; an almost overwhelming supply of the\r\nmatter; but the ultimate and best _form_ is yet largely wanting, and\r\nbeing so, it is now our most forcible and serious want.\r\n\r\nBut, rightly understood, all that we have said in reference to the\r\nshort-comings of our modes of educating the young, constitutes by no\r\nnecessity any sort of disparagement of teachers, or of the conductors of\r\nour school system. If a re-survey of the ground seems to show very much\r\nyet to be done, it is in part but the necessary result of an enlarging\r\ncomprehension as to what, all the while, should have been done. It is by\r\nlooking from an eminence that we gain a broader prospect, and\r\ncoincidently receive the conviction of a larger duty. Much that we\r\ndeplore in present methods is the best to which investigation has yet\r\nconducted us, or that the slow growth of a right view among the patrons\r\nof schools will allow. Then, how hard it is to foresee, in any direction\r\nof effort, the effects our present appliances and plans shall be\r\nproducing a score of years hence, or in the next generation--hardest of\r\nall to those whose work is directly upon that extremely variable\r\nquantity, mind! And in what other human business, besides that of\r\neducation, are there not in like manner remissnesses and errors to point\r\nout? Justice, in truth, requires the acknowledgment that probably no\r\nother body of men and women can take precedence of the teaching class,\r\nin devotion to their work, in self-sacrifice, or, indeed, in willingness\r\nto adopt the new when it shall also commend itself to them as\r\nserviceable; while, in a world of rough, material interests and\r\nsuccesses, like ours, the teacher's avocation still remains by far\r\nunderpaid, and by parents, and even by the very pupils on whom its\r\nbenefits are conferred, too rarely appreciated at anything like its just\r\ndeserts.\r\n\r\nIf further extenuation of present short-comings should be deemed\r\nneedful, the history of science--and let us not forget that this history\r\nis almost wholly a very _recent_ one--presents it in abundant force.\r\nThough practical arts have led to sciences, yet they have never advanced\r\nfar until after they have felt the reactive benefits of the sciences\r\nspringing from them. Finally, in its highest phases, the art becomes\r\nsubordinated to the science; thenceforth, the former can approach\r\nperfection only as the latter prepares its way. Education has advanced\r\nbeyond this turning point: the art is henceforward dependent on the\r\nsciences. But a science of education is an outgrowth from the science of\r\nmind; and among sciences, the latter is one of the latest and most\r\ndifficult. Thus, our investigations result, not in casting blame upon\r\neducators, but in revealing, we may say, what is still the intellectual\r\n'situation' of the most cultivated and advanced nations. We have our\r\nplace still, not at any sort of consummation, but at a given stage in a\r\nprogress. And still, as ever in the past, the things that in reality\r\nmost closely touch our interests are farthest removed from our\r\nstarting-points of sense and reason, and by a necessity of the manner\r\nand progress of our knowing, are longest in being found. And in this we\r\nhave at least the assurance that the perfection of our race is to occur\r\nby no sudden bound or transformation, but by a toilsome and patient\r\ninsight and growth.\r\n\r\nGranting, however, all that has now been said in palliation of existing\r\ndefects in education, that the whole business is a thing remote from\r\nimmediate interests, and not less so from immediate perceptions and\r\nreasonings--a thing that, to all eyes capable of seeing in it something\r\nmore than so many days devoted to spelling, penmanship, and arithmetic,\r\nbegins at once to recede from the vision, and to lie in the hazy\r\ndistance, obscure and incomprehensible--granting all this, and yet any\r\none who realizes what education is, a formative and determining process,\r\nthat for so many years is to operate persistently upon the plastic and\r\nintrinsically priceless mind, will assuredly be surprised in view of the\r\nactually existing indifference about questions as to the _method or\r\nmethods_ by which the work can most fully and satisfactorily be\r\naccomplished. We have enacted laws, built school-houses, provided\r\nlibraries, employed teachers, and in a tolerable degree insisted on the\r\nattendance of pupils, duly equipped with treatises of knowledge. We have\r\nlavished money on a set of instrumentalities, more or less vaguely\r\nconsidered requisite to insure qualification of the young for active\r\nlife, and the perpetuity of the national virtue and liberty. What we, in\r\nAmerica, however, have least essayed and most needed, has been to get\r\n_beneath the surface_ of the great educational question; to look less\r\nafter plans of school buildings, and the schemes of school-districts and\r\nfunds, and more into the structure of the lessons and studies, and the\r\nrelationships, applications, and value of the ideas secured or attempted\r\nduring the daily sessions of the school classes. It will be a great day\r\nfor us, when our principals and schoolmasters cease to put forward so\r\nprominently, at the end of the quarter or term, its smartest\r\ncompositions and declamations, and when the over-generous public shall\r\nbegin to attend on 'examinations' with a less allowance of eyes and\r\nears, and a more vigorous and active use of the discriminating and\r\njudging powers of their own minds. In the externals of education,\r\nEngland, France, and Germany must take rank after some of the States of\r\nour country; but in the matter of seeking the right interior qualities\r\nand tendencies of instruction, they have been in advance of us; though\r\njust now the anti-progressive spirit of their governments is interposing\r\nitself to hinder the largest practicable results by the schools, and to\r\nwhat extent it will emasculate them of their best qualities, time only\r\ncan show. Among our teaching class, the apathy is not confined to the\r\nill-rewarded incumbents of the lower positions; with rare exceptions, it\r\nis even more decided at the other extreme of the scale. Of all the\r\ngentlemen holding place in our over-numerous college faculties, and\r\ncommanding, one would expect, the very passes to the _terra incognita_\r\nof the human soul, how few seem disposed to prove their individual\r\n_faculties_ by any thoroughgoing and successful incursions into unknown\r\nregions of the psychologic and pedagogic realm! The spirit of this\r\nshould-be influential and leading class among us is one of serene assent\r\nin the iteration of the old steps, with of course some minor\r\nimprovements, but with no attempts at a grand investigation and\r\nsynthesis, such as gave to philosophy her new method, and to the world\r\nher growing fruitage of physical sciences.\r\n\r\nIf proof were needed of the comparative apathy under which we labor in\r\nrespect to activities and progress in the more abstract and higher\r\nplanes of intellectual effort, we find it in the contrast between the\r\nrewards meted out to the successful in this and in more material fields,\r\nin the general estimation awarded to the two classes of workers, and in\r\nthe present expressions of the public bereavement when leading\r\nrepresentatives of the two classes are removed from the scenes of their\r\nlabors. Compare the quiet with which the ordinary wave of business\r\ninterests and topic closed almost immediately over the announcement of\r\nthe death of Horace Mann, with the protracted eulogy and untiring\r\nreminiscence of person, habits, work, and success, that, after the\r\ndecease of William H. Prescott, kept the great wave of current topics\r\nparted for weeks--as if another Red Sea were divided, and the spirit of\r\nthe historian, lingering to the chanting of solemn requiems, should pass\r\nover it dry-shod! For the great historian this was indeed no excess of\r\nhonor, because grand human natures are worthy of all our praises; but\r\nwas there not a painful want of respect and requital to the equally\r\ngreat educator? Prescott wrote admirable volumes, and in our libraries\r\nthey will be 'a joy forever.' Horace Mann secured admirable means of\r\ninstruction, made admirable schools, awakened to their best achievements\r\nthe souls of our children; and his work is one to be measured by\r\nenlarging streams of beauty and joy that flow down through the\r\ngenerations. Would that, in the midst of so much justice as we willingly\r\nrender to self-sacrifice and worth, we could less easily forget those\r\nwhose labor it is directly to fit mankind for a higher nobleness, and\r\nfor higher appreciation of it when enacted in their behalf!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGUERDON.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Every life has been a battle\r\n    That has won a noble guerdon--\r\n  Every soul that furls its pinions\r\n  In proud Fame's serene dominions,\r\n    Wearily has borne its burden.\r\n\r\n  Through long years of toil and darkness,\r\n    Years of trial and of sorrow--\r\n  Days of longing, nigh to madness,\r\n  Nights of such deep, rayless sadness,\r\n    Hope herself scarce dared to-morrow.\r\n\r\n  Therefore bear up, O brave toiler\r\n    In the world's benighted places!\r\n  Though Truth's glory light your forehead,\r\n  Purer souls than yours have sorrowed,\r\n    Tears have flowed on angel-faces.\r\n\r\n  Therefore, bear up, O ye toilers!\r\n    Teachers of the earth's dull millions.\r\n  _Keep_ Truth's glory on each forehead,\r\n  And the way so blank and sorrowed\r\n    Shall lead on to heaven's pavilions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLITERARY NOTICES\r\n\r\n\r\nLEISURE HOURS IN TOWN. By the Author of 'The Recreations of a Country\r\nParson.' Boston: Ticknor and Fields. 1862.\r\n\r\n'The Country Parson' is one of those writers whose hap it generally is\r\nto be overpraised by friendly reviewers, and unduly castigated by those\r\nwho appreciate their short-comings. Incurably limited to a certain range\r\nof ideas, totally incapable of mastering the great circle of thought,\r\nunpleasantly egotistical, jaunty, and priggish, he is any thing but\r\nattractive to the large-hearted cosmopolite and scholar of broad views,\r\nwhile even to many more general readers, he appears as a man whom one\r\nwould rather read than be. On the other hand, the generous critic,\r\nremembering that small minds must exist, and that great excellence may\r\nbe developed within extremely confined bounds, will perhaps take our\r\nParson cordially for just what he is, and do justice to his many\r\nexcellencies.\r\n\r\nAnd they are indeed many, the principal being a humanity, a\r\nsensitiveness to the sufferings of others, and a tenderness which causes\r\nkeen regret that we can not 'just for once,' by a few amiable\r\npen-strokes, give him nothing but praise, and thereby leave him, by\r\nimplication, as one of the million _ne plus ultra_ authors so common--in\r\nreviews. We can hardly recall a writer who to so much firmness and real\r\nenergy, allies such warm sympathy for suffering in its every form. The\r\ntrials and troubles of young people awake in him a pity and a noble\r\ngenerosity which, could they be impressed on the minds of all who\r\ncontrol the destinies of youth, would make the world far happier than it\r\nis. Had he written only Concerning the Sorrows of Childhood, the Country\r\nParson would have well deserved the vast 'popularity' which his writings\r\nhave so justly won. 'Covenanting austerity' and Puritanical\r\nultra-propriety are repulsive to him and, he deals them many a brave\r\nblow. He sees life as it is with singular shrewdness, catches its lights\r\nand shadows with artistic talent, and like all tender and genial\r\nwriters, keenly appreciates humor, and conveys it to us either\r\ndelicately or energetically, as the point may require. He writes _well_,\r\ntoo, always. Clear as a bell, always to the point, refined enough for\r\nthe most fastidious gentleman and scholar, and yet intelligible and\r\ninteresting to any save the very illiterate. If any young aspirant for\r\nliterary honor wishes to touch the hearts of the people, and secure the\r\nfirst elements of popularity, we know of no living writer from whom he\r\nmay draw more surely for success than from the Country Parson. Pity that\r\nwhen we come to higher criticism, to the appreciation of truly great and\r\nbroadly genial views, he should fail as he does. Out of his canny\r\nScotch-English corner of thought, he is sadly lost. Thus, in one place\r\nwe have the following avowal, which is only not _naïf_ because evidently\r\nput in to please the prejudices of sympathetically narrow readers. After\r\narguing, with most amusing ignorance of the very first principles of a\r\ngeneral æsthetic education, that there is really no appeal beyond\r\nindividual taste, or beyond 'what _suits_ you,' he says:\r\n\r\n    'For myself, I confess with shame, and I know the reason is in\r\n    myself, I can not for my life see any thing to admire in the\r\n    writings of Mr. Carlyle. His style of thought and language is to\r\n    me insufferably irritating. I tried to read _Sartor Resartus_, and\r\n    could not do it.'\r\n\r\nAlmost in the same paragraph our Parson proclaims for all the world that\r\n'no man is a hero to his valet,' and says that there are two or three\r\nliving great men whom he would be sorry to see, since 'no human being\r\ncan bear a too close inspection.' 'Here,' he declares, 'is a sad\r\ncircumstance in the lot of a very eminent man: I mean such a man as Mr.\r\nTennyson or Professor Longfellow. As an elephant walks through a field,\r\ncrushing the crop at every step, so do these men advance through life,\r\nsmashing, every time they dine out, the enthusiastic fancies of several\r\nromantic young people.'\r\n\r\nIs this just? Is it _true_? The Parson, be it observed, speaks not\r\nsolely for 'romantic young people,' but for 'you' and for himself. Had\r\nhe read Carlyle's _Sartor Resartus_, he might there have learned that no\r\nman is a hero to his valet, not because he is not always great, but\r\nbecause that valet has a poor, flunkey, valet's soul. He who quotes such\r\nan aphorism as a truth, calls himself a valet.\r\n\r\nBut let the reader forget and forgive these drawbacks, which are rarely\r\nmanifested, and bear in mind that our pleasantly gossiping, earnest,\r\nhonest writer is, within his scope, one of the most delightful essayists\r\nin our English tongue. A man need not be a far-reaching thinker and\r\nscholar to be kind, good, and _true_, manly and agreeable. He may have\r\nhis self-unsuspected limits and weaknesses, and yet do good service and\r\nbe a delightful writer, cheering many a weary hour, and benefiting the\r\nworld in many ways. Such a writer is the Country Parson, and as such we\r\ncommend him to all who are not as yet familiar with his essays.\r\n\r\n\r\nCADET LIFE AT WEST-POINT. By an Officer of the United States Army. With\r\na Descriptive Sketch of West-Point, by BENSON J. LOSSING. Boston:\r\nT.O.H.P. Burnham. 1862.\r\n\r\nThe American public has long needed a work on West-Point, and we have\r\nhere a very clever volume, by one who has retained with great accuracy\r\nin his memory its predominant characteristics, and repeated them in a\r\nvery readable form. Occasional stiffness and 'mannerism' are in it\r\ncompensated for by many vivid pictures of cadet-life, and we can well\r\nimagine the interest with which every page will be perused by old\r\ngraduates of the institution, and others familiar with its details.\r\n\r\nWe regret to say that, on the whole, the work has not left with us a\r\npleasant impression of the system of instruction followed at West-Point.\r\nThere appear to be too many studies, too little time to master them, and\r\ntoo much stress laid on trifles. Certainly a strictly military school\r\nmust be different from others, and there can be no doubt that old\r\nofficers know better than civilians how young men should be trained for\r\nthe army. But we cannot resist the impression that if this work be\r\ntruthful, the author has, often unconsciously, shown that there is much\r\nroom for reform at West-Point.\r\n\r\n\r\nA DISCOURSE ON THE LIFE, CHARACTER, AND POLICY OF COUNT CAVOUR. By\r\nVINCENZO BOTTA, Phil. D. New-York: G.P. Putnam, No. 532 Broadway. 1862.\r\n\r\nThis excellent address which, in its present form embraces 108 octavo\r\npages, first delivered in the Hall of the New-York Historical Society,\r\nhas since been repeated to one of the most cultivated audiences ever\r\nassembled in Boston, on both occasions eliciting the most cordial\r\nadmiration from all who were so fortunate as to be present. Of the\r\nability of the eminent Dr. Botta to write on this subject, it is almost\r\nneedless to speak. A late member of the Italian Parliament, and formerly\r\nProfessor of Philosophy in the College of Sardinia, intimately\r\nacquainted with the great men of modern Italy, as with those of the\r\npast, in their writings, and cast by personal experience amid stirring\r\nscenes, he is singularly well qualified to write of Cavour, for whom it\r\nwas reserved to achieve, in a great measure, the work which the vain\r\nlongings of an enslaved people, and the heroic efforts of centuries,\r\nhad been unable to accomplish.' The work before us is, in fact, far\r\nmore than its very modest title would lead us to infer. It is, in fact,\r\na comprehensive and excellent history of all that great political\r\nrevival of Italy of which Cavour was the centre--a work as admirable for\r\nscholarly clearness as for the evidently vast knowledge on which it is\r\nbased. It is needless to say that we commend its perusal, with right\r\ngood-will, to all who take the slightest interest in historical studies\r\nor in the politics of modern Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KORAN. Translated by GEORGE SALE. With a Life of Mohammed. Boston:\r\nT.O.H.P. Burnham. 1862.\r\n\r\nGood authority in Arabic has declared that, after all the many versions\r\nof the Koran extant, there is none better than that by 'George Sale,\r\nGentleman,' first published in 1734. We therefore welcome the present\r\nedition, and with it even the very old-fashioned Life of Mohammed given\r\nwith it--a 'life' so very narrow in its views and antiquated in its\r\nexpression, that it has acquired a certain relish as a relic or literary\r\ncuriosity. We learn with pleasure that this is the first of a series of\r\nthe Holy Books of every nation, to embrace translations of the Vedas,\r\nthe Zend-Avesta, the Edda, and many others. Thoreau suggested many years\r\nago--we think in _Walden_--that such a collection should be published\r\ntogether for the world's use, and we rejoice to see his wish realized.\r\n\r\n\r\nJEFFERSON AT MONTICELLO. The Private Life of Thomas Jefferson. From\r\nentirely new materials, with numerous fac-similes. By Rev. HAMILTON W.\r\nPIERSON, D.D., President of Columbia College, Ky. New-York: Charles\r\nScribner, No. 124 Grand street. Boston: A.K. Loring. 1862.\r\n\r\n'The Private Life of Jefferson at Monticello' is too ambitious a title\r\nfor a little work of 138 pages, octavo though they be. It is, however,\r\nan extremely valuable and interesting collection of anecdotes,\r\nfac-simile documents, and casual reminiscences of Thomas Jefferson, as\r\npreserved by Captain Edmund Bacon, now a wealthy and aged citizen of\r\nKentucky, and who was for twenty years the chief overseer and\r\nbusiness-manager of Jefferson's estate at Monticello. In it we see the\r\nauthor of the Declaration and the statesman as he was at home, generous,\r\npeculiar, and far-sighted. Very striking is the following reminiscence\r\nof Captain Bacon:\r\n\r\n    'Mr. Jefferson did not like slavery. I have heard him talk a great\r\n    deal about it. I have heard him prophesy that we should have just\r\n    such trouble with it as we are having now.'\r\n\r\n\r\nA BOOK ABOUT DOCTORS. By J. CORDY JEAFFRESON. From the English edition.\r\nNew-York; Rudd and Carleton. Boston: A. Williams and Company. 1862.\r\n\r\nAn amusing and interesting collection of anecdotes of English physicians\r\nof all ages, copious enough in detail, and well enough written to escape\r\nthe charge of being a mere _pièce de manufacture_ and deserve place\r\namong the curiosities of literature. It is a work which will find place\r\nin the library of many a _medico_, and doubtless prove a profitable\r\ninvestment to the publisher. Hogarth's 'Undertaker's Arms' forms its\r\nappropriate and humorous vignette.\r\n\r\n\r\nA POPULAR TREATISE ON DEAFNESS, ITS CAUSES AND PREVENTION. By Drs.\r\nLIGHTHILL. Edited by E. BUNFORD LIGHTHILL, M.D. With Illustrations.\r\nNew-York: Carleton, Publisher, No. 413 Broadway, (late Rudd and\r\nCarleton.) Boston: A. Williams and Company. 1862.\r\n\r\nMany persons suffer from defective hearing, or lose it entirely, from\r\nwant of proper attention to the subject, or knowledge of the structure\r\nof the auricular organs. Thus the old often become incapable of hearing,\r\nyet let it pass without recourse to medical advice, believing the\r\ncalamity to be inseparable from the due course of nature. The present\r\nwork will, we imagine, prove useful both to practitioner and patient,\r\nand be the means of preserving to many a sense which, in value, ranks\r\nonly next to that of sight.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEDITOR'S TABLE\r\n\r\n\r\nIf any one doubts that there is a powerful Southern influence in active\r\noperation in the Union, let him reflect over the movement in Washington\r\n'for the purpose of reviving the Democratic party.' A more treacherous,\r\ntraitorous, contemptible political intrigue was never organized in this\r\ncountry; and the historian of a future day will record with amazement\r\nthe fact, that in the midst of a war of tremendous magnitude, when our\r\nnational existence and our whole prosperity were threatened, the enemy\r\nwere still allowed to plot and plan unharmed among us, under so shallow\r\na disguise that its mockery is even more insulting than would be open,\r\nbrazen opposition.\r\n\r\nThey have ingeniously taken advantage of the cry against the management\r\nof the war by McClellan, these covert disunionists, to form a McClellan\r\nparty, and 'to support General McClellan's war policy'! A more ingenious\r\nand more iniquitous scheme of fomenting disunion could not be devised.\r\nBy resolving to resist President Lincoln's moderate, judicious, and wise\r\nMessage, while on the other hand they indorsed in express contrast\r\nMcClellan, these treacherous disunion Democrats hoped to foment discord\r\namong us and thereby extend important aid to the enemy.\r\n\r\nIf the people would know where their foes are most active, let them look\r\nat home. Months ago they were warned that this very trick would be tried\r\namong us on behalf of the South. Months ago the Louisville _Journal_, in\r\nspeaking of the manner in which Southern spies in the North were working\r\nby treachery, declared that 'they wound a net-work of influences around\r\nCongress and the powers that be, to retain men in the departments and to\r\nget others in--especially in the War Department--who were shining lights\r\nin the 'castles' of the K.G.C. _for the avowed and express purpose of\r\naiding the enemy_ by treacherously watching and conveying the secrets of\r\nthe Government to the rebel army.'\r\n\r\nHas not this accusation been abundantly proved? Does not the whole\r\ncountry know that traitors, 'democratic' traitors, have acted so\r\nsuccessfully as spies that nothing has been kept secret from the enemy?\r\n\r\n'Men were selected in the States and sent hundreds of miles to\r\nWashington, with strong influences to back them for this purpose. Better\r\nto carry out their project, they adroitly raised the 'No Party' cry,\r\n_and by professing the most exalted and devoted loyalty_, claimed the\r\nbest places in which to betray the Union cause.' 'They claim a large\r\nnumber of the officers of companies, regiments, brigades, and divisions,\r\nand even have the audacity to whisper that General McClellan understands\r\ntheir programme and is not unfavorable to working up to it.'\r\n\r\nFortunately the great mass of the Northern people can not be affected by\r\nsuch traitorous tricks. There is but one party in the country, and that\r\nis the Union and the War party. Here and there a coward may waver and be\r\nfrightened at the prospect of a Democratic opposition raising its head\r\nsuccessfully to withstand the great onward movement, but his quavering\r\nvoice will be unheard in the great cry for battle. We have accepted this\r\nwar with all its fearful risks, and we will abide by it. We will be true\r\nto our principle of a united country, we will be true to our word to\r\ncrush rebellion, and we will be true to our brave soldiers who are\r\nfighting manfully for the right. If we adhere steadfastly to these\r\nresolutions, we shall have no cause to dread traitors within or foes\r\nwithout the loyal Union.\r\n\r\nWhen the World's Fair was held in 1851, in London, _Punch_, moved by the\r\nintensest spirit of British conceit, politely suggested that it would be\r\na good plan to have placards containing the words, 'It is good to have\r\nthe conceit taken out of us,' in all languages, hung all over the\r\nExhibition--the intention being to courteously intimate to foreigners\r\ntheir general inferiority to John Bull. Certainly it is a good thing to\r\nhave the conceit taken out of us--with the saving clause added by our\r\ncontributor, H.P.L.--'so that it be not done with the corkscrew of\r\nignorance,' or of conceit itself, as is generally the case when English\r\nwit attempts such extraction. Yet it must be admitted that in one thing\r\nBrother Jonathan has very fairly had the conceit taken out of him--which\r\nneed not have been, had he only attended to the lessons taught him by\r\nJohn Bull and Jean Crapaud.\r\n\r\nWe refer to the matter of iron-clad vessels of war. England already had\r\nher 'Warrior,' and France her 'Gloire,' with all their resistant powers\r\nfully tested by experiment, and yet this war had progressed one year\r\nwithout finding our Government in possession of a single iron-mail\r\nsteamer. Our foes, with many disadvantages, had more wit, and gained a\r\nvictory the more galling, because in naval matters we of the North claim\r\nin ability to rank with England herself. Perhaps history contains no\r\nparallel instance of such negligence, such weakness. It is a matter\r\ncalling for investigation and exemplary punishment. The guilt lies\r\nsomewhere, and must be atoned for.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, interesting to remark, that in this, as in so many other\r\nmatters, science is very rapidly changing the character of warfare. In a\r\nfew years the war-navies of the world will consist almost exclusively of\r\niron-mail steamers, since no other vessel can resist their attacks. Yet\r\nthese steamers, though far more expensive than the old wooden hulks--so\r\nexpensive that the 'Warrior' alone caused an outcry in England as a\r\nnational burden--can readily sink one another in a few minutes by the\r\nuse of the prow, or by returning to the primitive cock-fighting fashion\r\nin vogue among the iron-beaked galleys of earliest antiquity.\r\n\r\nWill it pay, under such extraordinary conditions of naval warfare, to\r\nfight at all? will probably be the next question, asked. When a few\r\nminutes may witness the literal sinking of a few millions of dollars,\r\ntax-paying people will begin to stand aghast. The very idea of England\r\nand America playing a game of war with such checks, is as terrible as it\r\nis startling; it is like the suggestion to fight out a duel with\r\ncolumbiads, or as the two Kentucky engineers are said to have done, with\r\nfull-steamed locomotives in collision. No patriotism, no wealth, no\r\nsacrifice, can endure such drafts as the loss of iron-clad navies would\r\ninvolve. War would eat itself up.\r\n\r\nPossibly genius may contrive vulcanized gutta-percha or other resistant\r\nsteamers which can neither be billed nor gaffed, shot nor slashed into\r\nsinking--vessels beyond all capacity for bathos, and no more to be\r\npersuaded into going under than was the black Baptist convert of David\r\nCrockett's story. What would naval battles amount to between such\r\ninvulnerables? The Roman mythology had a fable of a hare which had\r\nreceived from the gods the gift that it was never to be caught, while at\r\nthe same time there was a hound which was destined to catch every thing\r\nhe pursued. One day the hound began to chase the hare; Jupiter settled\r\nthe question by changing them both to stone. Paradoxes can only be\r\nsolved by annihilation. When war becomes, by the aid of science,\r\nall-destructive, yet all-resistant, it must perish. History shows a\r\ngradual decrease of deaths in proportion to improvements in destruction\r\nof life. It is gratifying to reflect, that this war, by developing the\r\nfull capacities of iron-plated vessels, has made a most important\r\nadvance toward the impossibility of warfare.\r\n\r\nIt is amusing to see how decisively, yet with what preposterous\r\nignorance of any thing like the true state of affairs in this country,\r\nthe English press informs the public as to the 'ex or inexpediency' of\r\nPresident Lincoln's Message.\r\n\r\nNot one of its editors has, as yet, had the grace or wit to discover\r\nthat, simply as a precedent and as a record, it puts an entirely new\r\nface on the war, by manifesting a _policy_ on the part of Government.\r\nNot one seems to appreciate that the slaveholder who, after its\r\npublication, loses his human chattels by the hap of war, has only\r\nhimself to thank for his loss. If Cuffy runs away, when the army comes,\r\nby what earthly show of sense or justice does the master complain, who\r\nhas refused to accept payment for him? _Dans la guerre, comme a la\r\nguerre_--in war-time, people must accept of war's chances.\r\n\r\nTo voluntarily offer to literally ease the fall of the enemy, as Mr.\r\nLincoln has done, is a stretch of magnanimity which would be\r\nincomprehensible to any Old World rulers. How long would a Napoleon or a\r\nWellington, unembarrassed by aught save the direst military conduct of a\r\nwar, have hesitated to free the blacks, and win victory by every or any\r\nmeans? Mr. Lincoln has had more difficult and complicated elements to\r\ndeal with. He has the enemy not only in the field, but by myriads at\r\nhome, among those who pretend to urge on the war. He has them 'spying\r\nand lying' every where--_promoting cabals in favor of a General, and\r\nexciting opposition, in order to eventually crush him_--urging Southern\r\nrights and amnesties--deluding and confounding every thing. No wonder,\r\nafter all, that the London _Times_, comprehending nothing, should have\r\nbeen so wildly asinine as to see in the Message only a bid to conciliate\r\nthe South!--a timid, making-up measure. The _Times_ is behind our times,\r\nand no wonder, when a Russell flounders about for it among us, becoming\r\nmore densely befogged and confused with every new idea which entangles\r\nitself with his pre-conceived English opinions.\r\n\r\nThe country is rejoiced to hear that General Wool has ordered Russell\r\naway from Fortress Monroe. When the latter quits the country, it will be\r\nas though it had heard some very good news for our nation's benefit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe were not at first disposed to believe in the many revolting stories\r\nso generally circulated, stating that the rebels had actually, in many\r\ninstances, boiled the bodies of the Federal dead, for the purpose of\r\nobtaining the bones as relics. So frequently, however, has the story\r\nbeen repeated, and from so many trustworthy quarters, that we are\r\nreluctantly compelled to admit that such paragraphs as the following,\r\nfrom the Southern correspondence of the Boston _Journal and Transcript_,\r\nare very possibly founded in fact:\r\n\r\n    '_Washington, 1st_.\r\n\r\n    'The certainty that the graves of the members of the Chelsea and\r\n    Boston Fusilier companies who fell in the advance on Bull Run,\r\n    last July, have all been despoiled, with a probability that their\r\n    bones were sent South, as relics, causes a deep feeling of\r\n    indignation here.\r\n\r\n    'A citizen of Cambridge, Mass., who went to Bull Run to recover\r\n    the remains of his brother, who belonged to a Boston company,\r\n    gives a sad account of the sacrilege committed upon the graves of\r\n    our soldiers by the rebels. About twenty of a Boston company and a\r\n    Chelsea company had been buried near each other, but every skull\r\n    had been taken away, and nearly all the principal bones of the\r\n    bodies were gone. Some of the bodies had been dug out, and others\r\n    pried out of the graves with levers, and in some the sleeves of\r\n    uniforms were split to obtain the bones of the arms. It was\r\n    described as a sickening spectacle.'\r\n\r\nWhen we recall the savage, half-Indian nature of many of the lower\r\nSouthern troops, and the threats of scalping and mutilating, in which\r\nthey so often indulged; and when we remember that even in Richmond, the\r\nbody of John Brown's son is still exposed, as the label on it intimates,\r\nnot as a scientific preparation, but as a warning to Abolitionists; we\r\nsee nothing extraordinary in such tales. If professors, men of science,\r\nand 'gentlemen' can wreak vengeance on the harmless bodies of the dead,\r\nand place a placard, expressing the hope that it may be thus with those\r\nwho simply differ with them in political opinions, it is not to be\r\nwondered at that their rude and ignorant _confrères_ should dig up dead\r\nbodies, and send the bones home as relics. It is just possible, however,\r\nthat we do not appreciate the true motives of these Ghouls. When\r\nScanderbeg died, his enemies fought among themselves to obtain the\r\nsmallest fragment of his bones, believing that their possession would\r\nconfer on the lucky wearer some of the courage of the great hero\r\nhimself. And so it may be that these craven savages hope to get a little\r\nreal Northern pluck and stubborn endurance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe cheerfully find place for the following, dated from 'Willard's,\r\nWashington, D.C., April 2d:'\r\n\r\n'DEAR CONTINENTAL: I know that the CONTINENTAL publishes nothing but\r\noriginal articles, and therefore beg you, at the request of your large\r\nand highly respectable Washington constituency, to find a shelf for the\r\nfollowing, which is original with Bill H. Polk _and_ the Louisville\r\n_Dem'docrat_:'\r\n\r\n    THE EXPERIENCES OF GEORGE N. SANDERS--HOW HE LEFT NASHVILLE, AND\r\n    HOW HE HOPES TO GET TO RICHMOND.\r\n\r\n    'There is no one better known in the country as a scholar, a\r\n    politician, and a wit, than Wm. H. Polk, of Tennessee. He has a\r\n    plantation some forty miles from Nashville, lives comfortably, has\r\n    a joke for every one, and is, withal, a resolute man in his\r\n    opinions. He was the opponent of the evanescent Harris, who has\r\n    disappeared mysteriously, and voted for by the coöperationists in\r\n    the election for Governor of that State. About a month ago notice\r\n    came to him that he must leave the State: a notice which, however,\r\n    he did not obey. His description of the terror of the rebels on\r\n    the taking of Nashville is said to be supremely rich. Among other\r\n    incidents, is one of peculiar interest to us Kentuckians,\r\n    concerning the fate of the late Provisional Government.\r\n\r\n    'Colonel Polk, a few days before the arrival of our army at\r\n    Nashville, and, indeed, before he heard of the fall of Fort\r\n    Donelson, in going down the road from his farm, descried a fat,\r\n    ragged, bushy-headed, tangled-mustached, dilapidated-looking\r\n    creature, (something like an Italian organ-grinder in distress,)\r\n    so disguised in mud as to be scarcely recognizable. What was his\r\n    surprise, on a nearer approach, to see that it was the redoubtable\r\n    George N. Sanders.\r\n\r\n    'George had met the enemy, and he was theirs--not in person, but\r\n    in feeling. His heart was lost, his breeches were ragged, and his\r\n    boots showed a set of fat, gouty toes protruding from them. The\r\n    better part of him was gone, and gone a good distance.\r\n\r\n    ''In the name of God, George, is that you?' said the\r\n    ex-Congressman.\r\n\r\n    ''Me!' said the immortal George; 'I wish it wasn't; I wish I was\r\n    any thing but me. But what is the news here? is there any one\r\n    running? They are all running back there,' (pointing over his\r\n    shoulder with his thumb.)\r\n\r\n    ''No,' said Mr. Polk; 'not that I know of. You needn't mind\r\n    pulling up the seat of your pantaloons; I'm not noticing. What in\r\n    the ---- are you doing here, looking like a muddy Lazarus in the\r\n    painted cloth?'\r\n\r\n    ''Bill,' said George to the Tennesseean confidentially, and his\r\n    tones would have moved a heart of stone: 'Bill, you always was a\r\n    friend of mine. I know'd you a long while ago, and honored\r\n    you--cuss me, if I didn't. I said you was a man bound to rise. I\r\n    told Jimmy Polk so--me and Jimmy was familiar friends. I intended\r\n    to get up a biographical notice of you in the _Democratic Review_,\r\n    but that ---- Corby stopped it I'm glad to see you; I'll swear I\r\n    am.'\r\n\r\n    ''Of course, old fellow,' said the charitable Tennesseean, more in\r\n    pity of his tones than even of the flattering eloquence: 'but what\r\n    is the matter?'\r\n\r\n    ''Matter!' said George; 'the d----d Lincolnites have seized\r\n    Bowling-Green, Fort Donelson, and have by this time taken\r\n    Nashville. Why,' continued he, in a burst of confidence, 'when I\r\n    left, hacks was worth a hundred dollars an hour, and, Polk, (in a\r\n    whisper,) I didn't have a d----d cent.'\r\n\r\n    'The touching pathos of this last remark was added to by the\r\n    sincere vehemence with which it was uttered, and the mute\r\n    eloquence with which he lifted up a ragged flap in the rear of his\r\n    person that some envious rail or brier had torn from its position\r\n    of covering a glorious retreat.\r\n\r\n    ''Not a d----d cent,' repeated he; 'and, Polk, I walked that\r\n    hard-hearted town up and down, all day, with bomb-shells dropping\r\n    on the street at every lamp-post--I'll swear I did--trying to\r\n    borrow some money; and Polk, do you think, there wasn't a\r\n    scoundrel there would lend any thing, not even Harris, and he got\r\n    the money out of the banks, too?'\r\n\r\n    ''No?' said Polk, who dropped in a word occasionally, as a sort of\r\n    encourager.\r\n\r\n    ''Bill,' repeated Sanders: 'Bill, I said you was a friend of\r\n    mine--and a talented one--always said so, Bill. I didn't have a\r\n    red, and I've walked forty-five miles in the last day, by the\r\n    mile-stones, and I haven't had any thing to buy a bit to eat;\r\n    and,' he added with impassioned eloquence, 'what is a cursed sight\r\n    worse, not a single drop to drink.'\r\n\r\n    'This is complete. It is unnecessary to tell how the gallant and\r\n    clever Tenneseean took the wayfarer home, gave him numerous, if\r\n    not innumerable, drinks, and filled him with fruits of fields and\r\n    flesh of flocks. When George was filled, however, he signified by\r\n    numerous signs, and finally by words, that he wished the servants\r\n    to leave the room. 'Polk,' said he, 'I knew you were a man with a\r\n    heart in your bosom; I told 'em so. I said no better man than Bill\r\n    Polk could be found. I told 'em so.'\r\n\r\n    ''Told who so?' asked Mr. Polk, rather surprised at the sudden and\r\n    mysterious language, accompanied by the removal of the servants.\r\n\r\n    ''Mr. Polk,' said Sanders, 'I want your horses and carriage for a\r\n    time.'\r\n\r\n    ''Certainly, Mr. Sanders, if you wish them.'\r\n\r\n    ''Mr. Polk,' said George, 'I do not appear before you in any\r\n    ordinary character to-day; I am clothed with higher authority; I\r\n    am an emissary.'\r\n\r\n    'The tone and manner indicated something fearful--perhaps to\r\n    arrest his host.\r\n\r\n    ''I am an emissary,' repeated Mr. Sanders, speaking in very large\r\n    capitals, 'from the State of Kentucky, and hope to be received as\r\n    such. The fact is,' continued he, coming down to the level of\r\n    familiar conversation, 'I left the Provisional Government of\r\n    Kentucky a mile or so back, on foot, finding its way southwardly,\r\n    and I demand your horses and carriage in the name of that noble\r\n    State.'\r\n\r\n    'Of course, the carriages were harnessed up at once, and Mr.\r\n    Sanders proceeded to bring the Provisional Government to Mr.\r\n    Polk's house.\r\n\r\n    'How shall we describe this part? Hon. George W. Johnson, as much\r\n    a Clay man as the sacred soil of Tennessee could afford, but still\r\n    preserving his light and active step; McKee, late of the\r\n    _Courier_, following; Walter N. Haldeman, with all his industry\r\n    and perseverance, trying to keep up with his associate; and Willis\r\n    B. Machen, vigorous, active, slightly sullen, but in earnest, with\r\n    every boot he drew out of the snowy, muddy soil giving a groan of\r\n    fatigue. Imagine them safely ensconced at Mr. Polk's, on their\r\n    road South.\r\n\r\n    ''Mr. Sanders,' said the Governor with dignified suavity, after\r\n    the walnuts and wine, 'claimed to be an acquaintance of yours, and\r\n    we were very glad to send him forward.'\r\n\r\n    'The Honorable Governor maintained throughout that easy, self\r\n    possessed manner which characterizes the gentleman.\r\n\r\n    'The emissary--for he ought to be so known--shortly after\r\n    suggested to the Provisional Government that he was 'broke,' and\r\n    wished to represent the Seventh Congressional District of\r\n    Kentucky, that is, the Louisville District: 'For,' said he, in his\r\n    persuasive, confidential tones, 'that is the only way I know of\r\n    for a man without money to get to Richmond.'\r\n\r\n    'A session was at once held of the State Council, and it is our\r\n    pleasure to record that Mr. Sanders is now authorized by the\r\n    Provisional Government to proceed to Richmond and represent our\r\n    interest in the Rebel Congress, vice H.W. Bruce, removed or\r\n    resigned.\r\n\r\n    'Mr. Polk at this time addressed the new Congressman, saying that\r\n    he had a particular favor to ask.\r\n\r\n    ''Bill,' said George to his host, speaking out of a full heart and\r\n    a full chest: 'Bill, you are a boy after my own heart; whatever\r\n    request you make I grant.'\r\n\r\n    ''It is only a trifle,' said Mr. Polk, 'which you can easily\r\n    grant, and which will please you.'\r\n\r\n    ''It is granted,' interrupted the grateful Sanders.\r\n\r\n    ''I may be arrested,' continued Mr. Polk, 'within a few minutes,\r\n    for disagreeing with some measures which Governor Harris has urged\r\n    upon the people.'\r\n\r\n    ''Never mind that,' said the impetuous Sanders; 'I'll stand by\r\n    you.'\r\n\r\n    ''All I want,' continued Mr. Polk, 'is for you to return to\r\n    Nashville as a hostage for my wife and family.'\r\n\r\n    ''Bill Polk,' said George gravely, but firmly, 'you are a man I\r\n    love; I love you, and I love your wife and family; but if ever I\r\n    go back to Nashville, may I be d----d!'\r\n\r\n    'Of course, there was no reply to this, and the redoubtable George\r\n    and the Provisional Government soon went on their way rejoicing.\r\n\r\n    'We do not pretend to give this in the language or manner of Mr.\r\n    Polk, which is said to be inimitable; neither do we claim him as a\r\n    'Union man.' He has remained quietly at home, and taken no part in\r\n    the contest; but we are indebted to him, or to some one who has\r\n    reported it as coming from him, for a genial and laughable account\r\n    of the exit of what once promised to be very injurious to our\r\n    State, and still more for his characterization of that wise,\r\n    pushing, incomprehensible character, George N. Sanders, Member of\r\n    Congress from the Seventh District of Kentucky to Richmond.'\r\n\r\nWe have long wondered what became of Sanders, the illustrious author of\r\nthat excellent term, 'the Tobacco States,' which so exactly defines the\r\nSouthern border. The last time we saw him was while talking with Arctic\r\nDr. Hayes, a few days before his departure for the Unknown Sea. Just\r\nthen Sanders went by arrayed in all the glory of a perfectly new _pareil\r\npartout_ suit of spring clothes. Days passed by, and we heard of him as\r\nfrantically endeavoring to galvanize the C.S.A. at Montgomery, Alabama,\r\ninto faith in his exceeding Southern proclivities. It was up-hill work,\r\nas we were told--almost as hard as several other small renegade literati\r\nand politicians found it, when they, too, went over into Dixie about a\r\nyear ago. In vain did George N. Sanders utter the largest size secession\r\nwords--no office rewarded him, no foreign mission fell into the fat\r\nfingers of the deserter. The change from the comfortable quarters of the\r\nNew-York Hotel to hurried war-marches and wild retreats must have been\r\nindeed trying; only that so many politicians have of late fared quite as\r\nbadly, that pity would seem wasted. Meanwhile we would suggest, as a\r\ngood question for youthful democratic debating-societies: 'When we catch\r\nthe enemy, what shall be done with George N. Sanders?'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding our war--to say nothing of our want--we have had the\r\nOPERA this winter; had it in great variety and perfection, and, as many\r\na reader can testify, with by no means thin houses. Grau has been\r\nbusy--the most courteous and indefatigable polyglot and active of\r\nimpresarios, with the good-natured Gosche, heralding a troupe of all the\r\nstars, D'Angri, Hinckley, Kellogg, Brignoli, Susini, and all the rest,\r\nincluding divers new singing birds. Maretzek has led, and we have had a\r\nrange from Mozart to Verdi, which was, on the whole, well-chosen. We\r\nhave had Brignoli singing, if possible, better, and acting, if possible,\r\nworse than usual--a nightingale imprisoned in a pump; Mme. D'Angri, with\r\nher _embonpoint_ voice, pouring forth like an inexhaustible fountain of\r\nMaraschino; Miss Hinckley, pleasant and pretty as ever, steadily singing\r\nher way star-ward; and Susini, who combines German strength with Italian\r\nfire--a true _Tedesco Italiana-zato_. Something, too, we would say of\r\nMancusi, whose clear and rapid execution, in _Figaro_, and whose real\r\nSpanish _majo_ rollicking style of acting were quite spirited enough,\r\neven for that very spirited part. Formes was indeed under the impression\r\nthat he himself was the _Figaro Figarorum_, the incarnate half-Spanish\r\nideal of that wonderful barbaresque conception; but then, the Formes\r\n_Figaro_ was 'developed from the depths of his subjective moral\r\nconsciousness,' whereas the _Figaro_ of a Southern European is _the\r\nthing itself_--like Charles Mathews playing the part of Charles Mathews,\r\nor like the Greek comedian's imitation of a pig's voice, by pinching a\r\nveritable pork-let, which he bore concealed within his mantle.\r\n\r\nPerhaps no character is so little appreciated by Anglo-Saxon audiences\r\nas this of _Figaro_. To them he is little more than a buffoon. To\r\nSouthern Europe, he is the bold, prompt, shrewd, popular ideal, suiting\r\nhimself by craft to every superior, regarding all things with a\r\nshoulder-shrugging, quizzical philosophy; a democratic Mephistopheles; a\r\nlurking devil, equalizing himself, and the people with him, by wit and\r\ninsolence, with nobility itself. Among the Latin races, as in the East,\r\nsuch Figaros often rise, like Oliver le Daim, to power, and the people\r\nunderstand it.\r\n\r\nFast-Day, in Boston, was operatically fêted with 'the light and\r\nmelodious _Martha_,' by that arch-thief of melodies, Flotow. Would\r\nnot--considering the day in question--_I Puritani_ have been more\r\nappropriate for 'a day of fasting and prayer'? It has already been\r\ndiscovered (by the sagacious Ullman, we believe) that the _Huguenots_\r\nwas appropriate to sacred concerts. A friend suggests that _Masaniello_\r\nfor high mass, and _Don Giovanni_ for St. John's day would be a great\r\nadvance in these dramatic unities.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to a new contributor for the following sketch:\r\n\r\n    We are all familiar with Hayden's dinner-party, and the\r\n    Comptroller of Stamps, and Charles Lamb's 'Diddle diddle\r\n    dumpling,' and 'Allow me to look at the gentleman's phrenological\r\n    development.' I am always reminded by it of a circumstance which\r\n    occurred between the Rocky and Alleghany mountains. A certain\r\n    witty professor of a certain Western college, had been invited to\r\n    deliver a poem before the Phi Beta Society of Athens--not the\r\n    capital of Greece, nor the Athens of America, but a sort of\r\n    no-town, without even the advantages of an established groggery,\r\n    or mutual admiration society. The poet, not having attained that\r\n    celebrity which is incompatible with keeping one's word with small\r\n    towns, small lyceums, and small profits, and the roads not being\r\n    stopped up, in short, 'Providence permitting, and nothing\r\n    happening to prevent,' the poet made his appearance at the proper\r\n    hour, like any ordinary mortal, and acquitted himself with such\r\n    rhythmical eloquence, such keen, silvery humor, as brought the\r\n    house down, and himself _vice versa_.\r\n\r\n    The audience having dispersed in a state like the afflatus of\r\n    laughing-gas, the poet and a privileged clique proceeded to the\r\n    house of the Baptist elder, to prolong the night with metaphysical\r\n    wassail. From the froth of poetry, they rose to a contemplation of\r\n    the old classics; Homer, Euripides, Sophocles, Virgil, rising\r\n    grandly from their dust, ensphered in vibratory eloquence.\r\n\r\n    The elder, whose, education had been accomplished simply by a New\r\n    Testament and three-inch rope, sat, or rather twisted through the\r\n    rhapsody, as a dunce twists through his Greek roots, and at the\r\n    first pause, drawing himself erect with the self-complacent air of\r\n    a man who applies the clincher, ejaculated, with the Western\r\n    twang: 'What do you think of Hi-awa_thy_?' The professor, giving\r\n    him one look, to be sure of his sanity, and a second to be sure of\r\n    his obtusity, answered gravely, above a convulsion of laughter:\r\n    'Hi-awathy was a genius!'\r\n\r\n    Athens has since then grown to be some town, with an aristocracy\r\n    composed of a few old maids, who attain the distinction from being\r\n    the oldest inhabitants, and a poet of its own. The latter has\r\n    immortalized himself by a poem in the Chatterton obsolete style,\r\n    on 'Ye Cobwebs in my Attick,' supposed to be an 'Allegory on my\r\n    Brain,' and from having once astonished one of the very _élite_ of\r\n    the aristocracy by requesting her to lend him her book, 'On the\r\n    Dogs of Venice.' Her ladyship assured him that she was not in\r\n    possession of the volume; but, on his insisting, conducted him to\r\n    her library, (six shelves, one and a half by four,) where he\r\n    seized upon a moth-eaten volume, illustrated on the front page by\r\n    a man of obesity, clad in very flowing robes, and an immense\r\n    crown, in the act of casting a ring into a black little stream\r\n    ornamented by six rushes and two swans, with this inscription\r\n    beneath: 'Venice wedding the Adriatic through the person of her\r\n    Doge.' A wit having suggested to this votary of the muse that he\r\n    should compose an epic on the royal canine of Venice, he is now\r\n    zealously devoting himself to the task, as the literary public are\r\n    respectfully invited to observe.\r\n\r\n    The Athenians were not long since electrified by the patriotic\r\n    eloquence of an itinerant Methodist evangelist, who wound up a\r\n    burst of rhapsodical patriotism with this, climax: 'If this\r\n    glorious Union is dissolved, what will become of the American\r\n    Eagle, that splendid bird with 'E Pluribus Unum' in his bill, the\r\n    shafts of Peace in his talons, and 'Yankee Doodle' tied to his\r\n    tail?'\r\n\r\n    One more _bon mot_, and I leave Athens to the plaudits of an\r\n    appreciative public.\r\n\r\n    The Presbyterian divine, running his thin fingers through his thin\r\n    hair, exclaimed, in a thin voice: 'Brethren! ye are the salts of\r\n    the earth.' 'The salts,' though as old as the Gospel, have not yet\r\n    lost their _freshness_.'\r\n\r\n    Exit Athens and fresh salt.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYE KNIGHT OF YE GOLDEN CYRCLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  A veray parfit gentil knight,\r\n  Thatte of ye Golden Cyrcle hight,\r\n    One day yridden forth;\r\n  But ne to finde a fayre mayde,\r\n  He went on errants of his trade,\r\n    To fight or filch ye North.\r\n\r\n  He was a wight of grisly fronte,\r\n  And muckle berd ther was upon 't,\r\n    His lockes farre down did laye:\r\n  Ful wel he setten on his hors,\r\n  Thatte fony felaws calléd Mors,\r\n    For len it was and grai.\r\n\r\n  Ilk knight he hadde ne vizor on,\r\n  His busynes were then undone,\r\n    All time was for attack;\r\n  More than, he hadde ne mail, either,\r\n  But arméd with a revolvér,\r\n    He like-_Wise_ chawed toback.\r\n\r\n  He sayde his was a mightie hond,\r\n  Ne better in ye Southron lond\r\n    To yearn anly battail:\r\n  Mony a dewel hadde he fought,\r\n  And put his foe alway to rout,\r\n    Withouten ony fail.\r\n\r\n  Eke fro his sheld ther stroke the ee,\r\n  These letters golden, 'F.F.V.,'\r\n    Thatte mony a clerk did pain;\r\n  Which guessed it, '_Forte Fuor Vi_!'\r\n  The people giggled, 'l' your ey;\r\n    It's Fume and Fight in Vain!'\r\n\r\n  Eftsoons hire cloke ye awful Night,\r\n  Yspreaden roun ilk warrihour wight,\r\n    Ye glasse of chivalrie;\r\n  But nothing daunt, he kept his course,\r\n  As well as mote his sorry hors,\r\n    Farre to the North countrée.\r\n\r\n  And thus in darkesse all yclad,\r\n  He hied him, gif he weren mad,\r\n    O'er feld and eke through thicket;\r\n  When 'Stop, by God!' some one began,\r\n  'You'er mine--'or any other man!''\r\n    Jesu! a Yankee picket!\r\n\r\n  'Gent knight, yclept of Golden Cyrcle!\r\n  Why in the devil don't one dirk all?\r\n    Where now's your chivalrie?'\r\n  'Goode sir,' quod he, 'twas ne for fight\r\n  I hied me out ilk murkie night,\r\n    It was for poulterie!'\r\n\r\n  'Wal, damn your 'poulterie'--and you!\r\n  Such deed no generous knight would do!\r\n    So I mote thee deter!\r\n  I'll show thee, though, the _coop_, sir knight,\r\n  Where _chickens_ such as thee are blight--\r\n    You are my prisoner!'\r\n\r\n  Mony maydens weren grieved--\r\n  Cleopatras, slouchy-sleeved--\r\n    Darksome maydes of work all;\r\n  And mony felaws of much might\r\n  Ydrink the hades of ye Knight\r\n    Of ye grete Golden Cyrcle.\r\n\r\nWe much fear that it may be said of the chief cavalier of the Golden\r\nCircle, what the old German _lanzknecht_, in Rabelais, said of the\r\nGascon adventurer: 'The knight pretends that he wants to fight, but is\r\nmuch more inclined to steal; therefore, good people, look out for your\r\nproperty.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following story, it is averred, can be vouched for, to any\r\nreasonable extent, by a large crowd of witnesses.\r\n\r\n    DEAR CONTINENTAL: Possibly you would not give 'a Continental dime'\r\n    for that which I am about to pen. Possibly, too, you may damn it\r\n    into the waste-basket. I have often _heard_ of a 'Continental\r\n    damn'--it never occurred to me before what the article really was.\r\n    Dante has, I know, provided a corner for those who were\r\n    _in_-continentally condemned; but it was reserved for you to\r\n    abridge the word, and so _make a vice of a virtue_!\r\n\r\n    I once lived in a village: to that village came an itinerant\r\n    dramatic company; and that company advertised to play a grand\r\n    moral temperance drama, entitled _Down the Hill_.\r\n\r\n    The principal actor called himself Eglantine Mowbray. I believe\r\n    that the latter syllable of the last name was the only portion\r\n    thereof to which he was really entitled. He _did_ bray.\r\n\r\n    The bills appeared, with the following heading:\r\n\r\n  UNPARALLELED ATTRACTION.\r\n\r\n  On Monday Evening,\r\n\r\n  THE YOUTHFUL ROSCUSS!\r\n\r\n  EGLANTINE MOWBRAY!!\r\n\r\n  Will appear in his great rôle,\r\n\r\n  DOWN THE HILL.\r\n\r\n    Our simple villagers _had_ seen circuses; but youthful Roscusses\r\n    were entirely beyond their experience. Quite as unfamiliar was the\r\n    word _rôle_, which, to their badly-lettered fancy, stood for\r\n    movement, by 'turning on the surface, or with a circular motion,\r\n    in which all parts of the surface are successively applied to a\r\n    plane, 'as to roll a barrel or puncheon.' [You use Webster?]\r\n\r\n    So, when the 'show' opened, there was a large attendance, and in\r\n    that vast multitude of two hundred and thirty men, women, and\r\n    children, there was not one who did not anticipate an acrobatic\r\n    performance.\r\n\r\n    The play pleased them, however. Temperance was rife among us in\r\n    those days; it was 'in our midst,' as people ought _not_ to say,\r\n    and the drunken disgraces of John the Inebriate were appreciated.\r\n    Still, there was an evident feeling of unsatisfied anticipation,\r\n    which grew with every act, and in all the house there was not a\r\n    soul who did not murmur to his or her neighbor, 'I wonder when\r\n    he's goin' to roll down-hill.'\r\n\r\n    The play terminated. The Inebriate died, under a strong pressure\r\n    of delirium tremens, groaning and braying loud enough to scare\r\n    away the fiends which gathered around. But, to the amazement of\r\n    all parties upon the stage and behind the scenes, the fall of the\r\n    curtain was accompanied by a thunder-roar of disgust, and the\r\n    rain-like sound of numerous hisses.\r\n\r\n    The audience voted the play a humbug. The village was disgusted.\r\n    Eglantine Mowbray stock went down to nothing.\r\n\r\n    But the manager was a shrewd fellow. He found out what was\r\n    wanting, and resolved to remedy it. So, the next morning's posters\r\n    announced that on that evening Mr. Eglantine Mowbray would\r\n    perform, at the conclusion, his terrific and unparalleled feat of\r\n    _rolling_ down the hill!\r\n\r\n    And he did. At the last moment, the Inebriate appeared, bottle in\r\n    hand, agonizing and howling on the summit of a high rock, from\r\n    which a slope, at an angle of forty-five degrees, went down to a\r\n    mysterious craggy pit, thickly grown around with briers and\r\n    shrubs, all bearing spiky thorns of the most fish-hooky and\r\n    ten-penny nail description imaginable. The _flat_ or back-scene,\r\n    suddenly lighted up from behind, presented, as a transparency,\r\n    that terrible collection of devils which you may have witnessed in\r\n    a popular engraving entitled, 'Delirium Tremens.' The Inebriate,\r\n    taking one parting drink, staggered--fell--rolled over and over\r\n    _down the hill_ into the abyss, from which flames burst forth,\r\n    red, green, and blue, and the audience were wild with delight.\r\n    Three times was Eglantine Mowbray compelled, by the rapturous\r\n    encores, to roll down that hill into the fiery pit. No wonder\r\n    that, at the last trial, there rose from the abyss a wild cry of\r\n    'I'll be _blessed_ if I do it again.'\r\n\r\n    MORAL.--When in country villages, don't talk about rôle-ing,\r\n    unless you mean to do it!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSince the _gilet de matin_ has superseded the _robe de châmbre_, or\r\ndressing-gown, it is marvelous to see with what wrath the fast men,\r\nclub-men, and other highly civilized forms of humanity, pursue the\r\nancient garment. One of the most vigorous assaults on the gabardine in\r\nquestion, comes to us as\r\n\r\n    A FLING AT DRESSING-GOWNS.\r\n\r\n    My name is Albert Fling. I am an active, business, married man,\r\n    that is, wedded to Mrs. Fling, and married to business. I had the\r\n    misfortune, some time since, to break a leg; and before it was\r\n    mended Madame Fling, hoping to soothe my hours of convalescence,\r\n    caused to be made for me a dressing-gown, which, on due\r\n    reflection, I believe was modeled after the latest style of\r\n    strait-jacket. This belief is confirmed by the fact that when I\r\n    put it on, I am at once confined to the house, 'get mad,' and am\r\n    soberly convinced that if any of my friends were to see me\r\n    walking in the street, clad in this apparel, they would instantly\r\n    entertain ideas of my insanity.\r\n\r\n    In the hours of torture endured while wearing it, I have appealed\r\n    to my dear wife to truly tell me where she first conceived the\r\n    thought that there was a grain of comfort to be found in bearing\r\n    it on my back? She has candidly answered that she first read about\r\n    it in divers English novels and sundry American novels, the latter\r\n    invariably a rehash of the first. In both of these varieties of\r\n    the same species of books, the hero is represented as being very\r\n    comfortable the instant he dons this garment, puts his feet in\r\n    slippers, picks up a paper and--goes to sleep.\r\n\r\n    A friend of mine who has discovered that Shakspeare knew all about\r\n    steam-engines, electric telegraphs, cotton-gins, the present\r\n    rebellion, and gas-lights, assures me that dressing-gowns are\r\n    distinctly alluded to in _The Tempest_:\r\n\r\n    'TRINCULO: O King Stephano! look, what a wardrobe here is for\r\n    thee!\r\n\r\n    CALIBAN: Let it alone, thou fool; it is but trash.\r\n\r\n    Having thus proved its age, let us next prove that it is in its\r\n    dotage, and is as much out of place in this nineteenth century as\r\n    a monkey in a bed of tulips.\r\n\r\n    We find in the Egyptian temples paintings of priests dressed in\r\n    these gowns: proof that they are antiquely heathenish. And as we\r\n    always associate a man who wears one with Mr. Mantilini, this\r\n    proves that they are foolish. _Ergo_, as they are old and foolish,\r\n    they are in their dotage.\r\n\r\n    I have three several times, while wearing this gown, been mistaken\r\n    for Madame Fling by people coming to the house. The first time I\r\n    was shaving in my chamber: in bounced Miss X----, who believed, as\r\n    it was rather late, that I had gone down-town. She threw up her\r\n    hands, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n    'Good gracious, Fanny! do you shave?'\r\n\r\n    N.B.--Fanny is my wife's first name.\r\n\r\n    The second time I had brought the woodsaw and horse up from the\r\n    cellar, and was exercising myself sawing up my winter's wood, in\r\n    the summer-kitchen, according to Doctor Howl's advice, when the\r\n    Irishman from the grocery entered, bearing a bundle. My back was\r\n    to him, and only seeing the gay and flowery gown, he exclaimed, in\r\n    an awfully audible whisper to the cook:\r\n\r\n    'Shure yer mistriss has the power in her arms, jist!'\r\n\r\n    Think of my wife, my gentle Fanny, having it shouted around the\r\n    neighborhood that her brute of a husband made her saw all their\r\n    winter's wood--yes! and split it, and pile it too, and make all\r\n    the fires, and so on and cetera, and oh! I _am_ glad my husband\r\n    isn't such a monster!'\r\n\r\n    I turned on the Irishman, and when he saw my whiskers, he quailed!\r\n\r\n    The third time, I was blacking my boots, according to Dr. Howl's\r\n    advice, 'expands the deltoid muscles, is of benefit to the\r\n    metacarpis, stretches the larynx, opens the oilsophagers, and\r\n    facilitates expectoration!' I had chosen what Fanny calls her\r\n    conservatory for my field of operation--the conservatory has two\r\n    dried fish-geraniums, and a dead dog-rose, in it, besides a\r\n    bad-smelling cat-nip bush; when, who should come running in but\r\n    the identical Miss X---- who caught me shaving.\r\n\r\n    'Poor Fanny,' said she, before I could turn round; 'do you have to\r\n    black the boots of that odious brute?'\r\n\r\n    'Miss X----,' said I, turning toward her, folding my arms over my\r\n    dressing-gown, spite of having a damp, unpolished boot on one arm\r\n    and a wet blacking-brush in the other hand, for I wished to strike\r\n    a position and awe at the same time; 'Miss X----, I am that odious\r\n    brute himself!'\r\n\r\n    If you had observed her wilt, droop, stutter, fly!\r\n\r\n    My wife went to the sea-shore last summer. I kept the house open,\r\n    and staid in town; cause, business. When she returned, Miss X----,\r\n    who lives opposite, called to see her. In less than five minutes,\r\n    my wife was a sad, moaning, desolate, injured, disconsolate,\r\n    afflicted, etcet. woman.\r\n\r\n    'How-ow-ow c-could you d-do it, Al-lal-bert?' she ejaculated,\r\n    flooding every word as it came out with tears.\r\n\r\n    'Do what?'\r\n\r\n    'Oh-woh! oh-woe-wooh-wa-ah!'\r\n\r\n    Miss X---- here thought proper to leave, casting from her eyes a\r\n    small hardware-shop in the way of daggers at me, as much as to\r\n    say, You are vicious, and I hate cheese! (theatrical for hate ye.)\r\n\r\n    Fanny, left to herself, revealed all to me. Miss X----, through\r\n    the Venetian blinds, had seen a--_gown_ in my room, late at night.\r\n\r\n    'It is too true,' said I, 'too, too true.'\r\n\r\n    'Al-lal-al-bert! you will b-b-break my h-heart. I c-could tear the\r\n    d-d-destroy-oy-yer of my p-p-peace to p-p-pieces!'\r\n\r\n    'Come on,' said I, 'you shall behold the destroyer of your peace.\r\n    You shall tear her to pieces, or I'll be d--dashed if I don't. I\r\n    am tired of the blasted thing.'\r\n\r\n    I grasped her hand, and led her to the back-chamber. 'There,\r\n    against the wall.'\r\n\r\n    'It is--'said she.\r\n\r\n    'It is,' said I, 'my dressing-gown! I will never again put it on\r\n    my shoulders, never. Here goes!' Rip it went from the tails up the\r\n    back to the neck.\r\n\r\n    'Hold, Albert! I will send it to the wounded soldiers.'\r\n\r\n    'Never! they are men, bricks, warriors. Such female frippery as\r\n    this shall never degrade them. Into the rag-bag with it, and sell\r\n    it to the Jews for a pair of China sheep or a crockery shepherd.\r\n    _Vamos_!'\r\n\r\nThe age for dressing-gowns has passed away, Rococo shams are hastening\r\nto decay!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe who writes a book on Boston should have something to say on the\r\nladies at lectures, in the libraries, and at Loring's--at which latter\r\ncelebrated institution for the dissemination of _belles lettres_\r\nlettered belles do vastly congregate of Saturday, providing themselves\r\nwith novel--no, we mean novelties [of course of a serious sort] for\r\ntheir Sunday reading. Which may serve as an introduction to the\r\nfollowing characteristic of\r\n\r\n    YE BOSTON YOUNGE LADIE.\r\n\r\n    The Boston belle is a reader, and knoweth what hath lately\r\n    appearyd in ye worlde of bookes as welle as in that of bonetts.\r\n    Shee whispereth of Signore Brignoli and of Hinkley, and of ye\r\n    Philharmonic, or of Zerrahn his concertes, and eftsoones of\r\n    aeriall pleasures att parties and concertes, and anon flitteth to\r\n    Robertus Browning his poetrie, or to Emerson hys laste discourse\r\n    att ye Musicke Halle. Whan so be itt that twentie of ye sisterhode\r\n    be gatheren together, lo! seven thereof wyll haue blonde tresses\r\n    and nineteen be of fayre ruddie complexion, whych a man wolde gife\r\n    hys lyfe to kisse--yea, and itt oftwhyles passeth that ye\r\n    twentieth also hath more whyte and rudd in hir sweete face thann\r\n    ye wolde see in other landes.\r\n\r\n    Ye Boston demoisselle weareth an waterproof guyascutus, [for so\r\n    methinketh I haue hearde them calld,] and whan that itt rayneth or\r\n    snoweth, shee rusheth forth as to a carnavall, and heedeth not yf\r\n    ye powderie snowe-flakes falle on hir daintie littyl nose, or pile\r\n    up like untoe a chancellor's wigg on hir hed. Arounde hir whyte\r\n    necke shee ever bindeth a scarlett scarfe, to shewe thatt she ys\r\n    an well-redd woman; and whan shee turneth homewardes, she aye\r\n    beareth in one hande a pamflet, whyle the other holdeth a bouquet\r\n    of flowres or a pacquette of sugirplummes or confitures. Whyles\r\n    that she is yett younge and reckeless, and gif shee bee faste, and\r\n    hathe naughte to beare homewards, lo! shee stiketh bothe tinie\r\n    fistes intoe hir small syde-pockets, and propelleth onward\r\n    mightilie independente, caring naught for nobodie. I haue herd\r\n    from dyvers graue and reuerend menn, who oughte to know, [sith\r\n    that ther wyves hadd tolde them,] that manie of these demoiselles\r\n    do wear verie longe bootes, but howe long they may bee I knowe\r\n    not.\r\n\r\n    Hee who walketh in Beacon streete on Sundaye, whan thatt the skies\r\n    be fayre, seeth, after church out-letting, manie of these sweete\r\n    maydens walking wyth ther cavalleros up and doune hille, talkyng\r\n    of manie thynges.

For shee holdeth _dixi et\r\n    solvavi animam meam_ to bee a goode rule, and thatt it is nott a\r\n    goode thinge to goe away with wrathe pente up in ye boosum.\r\n\r\n    She worketh harde for ye armie; yea, she knitteth stockyngs and\r\n    maketh shertes for ye contrabandes, whereof I haue scene one\r\n    whiche a contrabande with his wyfe and children didde all were at\r\n    once, so nobly greate was it.

And thatt theye aye\r\n    all thus become goode wives and brave mothers, and bee bleste and\r\n    happie in alle thynges, is ye heartes prayer of\r\n\r\n    CLERKE NICHOLAS.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following extract from the Washington correspondence of the\r\nPhiladelphia _Press_ is significant:\r\n\r\n    'As pertinent to these questions, let me ask if you have ever gone\r\n    back to the time when most of the Breckinridge papers in the free\r\n    States were in danger of being mobbed and torn out after the fall\r\n    of Fort Sumter?\r\n\r\n    'I will not ask why these demonstrations occurred, but I will ask\r\n    if you can point to any one of these journals that is not _now_\r\n    filled with strong denunciations of the Administration and its\r\n    friends, and timid reproaches of the rebels in arms? Are they not\r\n    all clamorous for the reörganization of the Democratic party? Are\r\n    they not all against any combination of patriotic men under the\r\n    name of a Union party? Their object is as plain as their early\r\n    treason was notorious, and the end of their victory will be the\r\n    recognition of the armed rebels, or their full forgiveness. The\r\n    armed rebels are watching their movements with eagerness and joy.'\r\n\r\nThat they are doing so, is amply evidenced by the recent 'democratic'\r\nand treasonable movements in Washington. In time of war, and especially\r\nof such a war as this, there can be, as Mr. Douglas said, 'but patriots\r\nand traitors.' Away with all parties--till the enemy are ours, the only\r\nparties should be those of the North and South.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe municipal authorities at Nashville met Governor Johnson's appeal,\r\nurging them to take the oath of allegiance, by a prompt refusal--falling\r\nback 'for reasons' on State rights. There should be, in these times, but\r\none way of dealing with all such State rights gentlemen--arrest as\r\ntraitors, and trial under military law. This is no day for\r\ndilly-dallying and quibbling about 'State rights.' There is only one\r\nright in such cases--the right of the Union, and fidelity to it. This\r\nrebuff is generally spoken of by the press as 'the Nashville Snag.'\r\nThere be such things as snag-extractors, and we trust that our\r\nGovernment is free enough from red-tape do-nothingism and\r\ncircumlocution, to make short work of these insolent rebels, whatever\r\nthey be.\r\n\r\n    _Boston, April 1st._\r\n\r\n    DEAR EDITOR: I jot down the following as one of the most\r\n    melancholy results of this wicked and cruel war:\r\n\r\n    The Captain at our house believes in General Butler. The Lawyer\r\n    don't. Such is the state of parties at our table. As I said\r\n    before, the hand of brother is uplifted against brother, and\r\n    either may become a fratri-cider--as the fellow did when he\r\n    squeezed his brother to death in the press, among the apples.\r\n\r\n    The captain said, the other day, that Butler had a great deal of\r\n    dash.\r\n\r\n    'U--m!' growled the lawyer; 'one kind of dash he certainly has--to\r\n    perfection.'\r\n\r\n    'And what is that?'\r\n\r\n    'Balder-dash!' was the annihilating reply.\r\n\r\n    I report this for the special consideration of Governor Andrew.\r\n\r\n    Nor less illustrative of the terrible tendencies of civil war, is\r\n    the following:\r\n\r\n    'We have a whole navy of gun-boats at Island Number Ten,' said the\r\n    Colonel, reflectively.\r\n\r\n    'Yes,' was the unwary reply.\r\n\r\n    'Then how comes it that if the knave can take the Ten, a navy\r\n    can't?'\r\n\r\n    Yours in grief,\r\n\r\n    CONSTANT READER.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Legislature of Kentucky has, probably, by this time, made it a\r\ncriminal offence for any person to join the K.G.C. As soon as the lists\r\nshall have been published of all those Northern men who have belonged to\r\nthe order, the traitors will find themselves in quite as enviable a\r\nsituation as though 'escaped convict' were branded on their foreheads.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\nFrom one now far away in the South--albeit\r\nnot on the Southern side--we have\r\nan ornithological reminiscence which\r\nmay be of interest to those who endeavor\r\nto solve the problem, whether\r\nanimals ever rise to reasoning.\r\n\r\n    I have amused myself the past year raising a brood of chickens in\r\n    my little backyard. Being 'tenderly brought up,' they are, of\r\n    course, very tame, particularly a little brown pullet, that lays\r\n    an egg in the cellar every morning. A few days ago, as I was\r\n    leaving the house after breakfast, my wife cried out for me to\r\n    come into the kitchen. I did so, and found the little brown hen\r\n    standing quietly by the door at the head of the cellar-stairs,\r\n    evidently waiting for it to be opened. Going outside, I found the\r\n    servant had neglected to open the 'bulkhead' door, as usual, and\r\n    my wise little biddy had concluded to go down-cellar through the\r\n    kitchen. When I drove her out and opened the outer-door, she went\r\n    down and laid, as usual. She was never in the house before, to my\r\n    knowledge, and has not been since. This is a fact, and is only one\r\n    more instance added to many I could adduce, which go to show that\r\n    the 'dumb creatures' think and reason.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPoetry on bells is divisible into two kinds, the _tintinnabulistic_,\r\nwhich refers to little hand-tinklers, sleigh-bells, and the kind which\r\noriental mothers were wont, of old, to sew to the hems of their\r\ndaughters' garments, [that they might tell by the sound whether the\r\nyoung ladies were at mischief or no,] and the _campanologistic_,\r\ndescriptive solely of large church ringers, Big Toms of Oxford, and the\r\nregular _vivos voco, fulgura frango_ giants, such as Mr. Meneely makes\r\nand sends all over the country, to factories, churches, dépôts, and\r\nsteamboats. The sleigh-bell song, according to this classification, is\r\ntintinnabulistic; so, too, is the Russian _troika_,\r\n\r\n  'I kolokolchick dor voltaia,'\r\n\r\nas is also the immortal line which speaks of\r\n\r\n  That tocsin of the soul--the dinner-bell.'\r\n\r\nBut Schiller's great ringing poem is superbly _campanologistic_; so is\r\nSouthey's 'Inch Cope Bell,' and to this division belong all tollings,\r\nfire-alarms, and knells in verse whatever.\r\n\r\nThe following lyric is, however, far above either, as it ambitiously\r\nembraces the whole subject, and therefore, so far as comprehensiveness\r\nis concerned, must of course take precedence even of Tennyson's 'Ring\r\nOut!'\r\n\r\nABOUT BELLS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I was sitting, one night, in my easy-chair,\r\n  When a bell's clear notes rung out on the air;\r\n  And a few stray thoughts, as this ballad tells,\r\n  Came into my mind, about sundry bells:\r\n\r\n  About church-going bells, whose solemn chime\r\n  Calls, far and near, 'It's time! _it's time!_'\r\n  While the worshiper goes, with a faith that is strong,\r\n  For he knows he can trust their clear '_Ding-dong!_'\r\n\r\n  Of deified bells, like Bel of old,\r\n  With silver tongues and a ring of gold;\r\n  While the many who run at their silvery call,\r\n  Never reach the goal--d; but tire and fall!\r\n\r\n  Of modest bells, by the river's side,\r\n  As they meekly hang o'er the liquid tide;\r\n  But are tongueless all, and their changes few,\r\n  For they ever appear in a dress of blue.\r\n\r\n  Of modern Belles, which the world well knows,\r\n  Go all the ways that the fashion goes;\r\n  And ring their chimes through an endless range,\r\n  As they change their rattle, and rattle their '_change_.'\r\n\r\n  Of divers' bells, which are made to go,\r\n  With their living freight, to the depths below;\r\n  And are quiet quite, on their water ways,\r\n  Save hen they are trying to 'make a raise.'\r\n\r\n  Of door-bells, which our callers ring\r\n  By a kind of a sort of a wire of a string;\r\n  Answered oft, as wire-pullers ought to be--\r\n  '_Not at home!_' meaning, '_Not in order to see!_'\r\n\r\n  About John Bells, _one_ of whom, we know,\r\n  Politicians rung not long ago;\r\n  An unlucky Bell, and to-day a wreck,\r\n  But fit, even _now_, to be wrung--_by the neck!_\r\n\r\n  About Isabelles, so diverse in kind,\r\n  That the one you prefer isn't hard to find;\r\n  Yet hard 'tis to be in _this_ all agreed--\r\n  Isabelle by name _is_ a belle in-deed!\r\n\r\n  And thus, as I sat in my easy-chair,\r\n  While the bell's clear notes rung through the air,\r\n  Did a few stray thoughts, as this ballad tells,\r\n  Come into my mind, about sundry bells.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n'Is this 'dreadful bad'?' inquires a correspondent. Gentle writer, it is\r\nnot dreadful, neither is it bad; and we appeal to the reader to decide.\r\nTo our thought, it is as brave and wild a love-poem as we have seen for\r\nmany a day:\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE KING.\r\n\r\n\r\n  A Health to the King--my king!\r\n  But not in the ruby wine,\r\n  Too pale for the name I sing;\r\n  Too weak for such love as mine!\r\n\r\n  How shall I pledge thee, my king?\r\n  What nectar shall fill the bowl?\r\n  Hope herself can not bring\r\n  A wine--like that in my soul!\r\n\r\n  Then take for a pledge, my king!\r\n  A life--it is wholly thine;\r\n  And quaff from the cup, O king!\r\n  A soul--not the ruby wine!\r\n\r\nHappy the gentleman who is crowned king with the garland of song and\r\nconsecrated with the wine of life and of love.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE PICKET GUARD.\r\n\r\nBY J.L.

These crises sweep away in a moment\r\nthe landmarks of generations. They call out fresh talent, and give to\r\nthe old a new direction. It is then that new ideas are born, new\r\ntheories developed. Such periods demand fresh exponents, and new men for\r\nexpounders.\r\n\r\nThis Continent has lately been convulsed by an upheaving so sudden and\r\nterrible that the relations of all men and all classes to each other are\r\nviolently disturbed, and people look about for the elements with which\r\nto sway the storm direct the whirlwind. Just at present, we do not know,\r\nwhat all this is to bring forth; but we do know that great results MUST\r\nflow from such extraordinary commotions.\r\n\r\nAt a juncture so solemn and so important, there is a special need that\r\nthe intellectual force of the country should be active and efficient. It\r\nis a time for great minds to speak their thoughts boldly, and to take\r\nposition as the advance guard. To this end, there is a special want\r\nunsupplied, it is that of an Independent Magazine, which shall be open\r\nto the first intellects of the land, and which shall treat the issues\r\npresented, and to be presented to the country, in a tome no way tempered\r\nby partisanship, or influences be fear, favor or the hope of reward;\r\nwhich shall seize and grapple with the momentous subjects that the\r\npresent disturbed state of affairs heave to the surface, and which CAN\r\nNOT be laid aside or neglected.\r\n\r\nTo meet this want, the undersigned has commenced, under the editorial\r\ncharge of CHARLES GODFREY LELAND, the publication of a new Magazine,\r\ndevoted to Literature and National Policy.\r\n\r\nIn POLITICS, it will advocate, with all the force at its command,\r\nmeasures best adapted to preserve the oneness and integrity of these\r\nUnites States. It will never yield to the idea of any disruption of this\r\nRepublic peaceably or otherwise; and it will discuss with honesty and\r\nimpartiality what must be done to save it. In this department, some of\r\nthe most eminent statesmen of the time will contribute regularly to its\r\npages.\r\n\r\nIn LITERATURE, it will be sustained by the best writers and ablest\r\nthinkers of this country.\r\n\r\nAmong its attractions will be presented, in the June Number, a NEW\r\nSERIAL of American Life, by RICHARD B. KIMBALL, Esq., the very popular\r\nauthor 'The Revelations of Wall-Street,' 'St. Leger,' etc. A series of\r\npapers by Hon. HORACE GREELEY, embodying the distinguished author's\r\nobservations on the growth and development of the Great West. A series\r\nof articles by the author of 'Through the Cotton States,' containing the\r\nresult of an extended tour in the seaboard Slave States, just prior to\r\nthe breaking out of the war, and presenting a startling and truthful\r\npicture of the real condition of that region. No pains will be spared to\r\nrender the literary attractions of the CONTINENTAL both brilliant and\r\nsubstantial. The lyrical or descriptive talents of the most eminent\r\n_literati_ have been promised to it; and nothing will be admitted which\r\nwill not be distinguished by marked energy, originality, and solid\r\nstrength. Avoiding every influence or association partaking of clique or\r\ncoterie, it will be open to all contributions of real merit, even from\r\nwriters differing materially in their views; the only limitation\r\nrequired being that of devotion to the Union, and the only standard of\r\nacceptance that of intrinsic excellence.\r\n\r\nThe EDITORIAL DEPARTMENT will embrace, in addition to vigorous and\r\nfearless comments on the events of the times, genial gossip with the\r\nreader on all current topics, and also devote abundant space to those\r\nracy specimens of American wit and humor, without which there can be no\r\nperfect exposition of our national character. Among those who will\r\ncontribute regularly to this department may be mentioned the name of\r\nCHARLES F. BROWNE, ('Artemus Ward.') from whom we have promised an\r\nentirely new and original series of SKETCHES OF WESTERN LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe CONTINENTAL will he liberal and progressive, without yielding to\r\nchimeras and hopes beyond the grasp of the age; and it will endeavor to\r\nreflect the feelings and interests of the American people, and to\r\nillustrate both their serious and humorous peculiarities. In short, no\r\npains will spared to make it the REPRESENTATIVE MAGAZINE of the time.\r\n\r\nTERMS.--Three Dollars per year, in advance, (postage paid by the\r\nPublishers;) Two Copies for Five Dollars; Three Copies for Six Dollars,\r\n(postage unpaid;) Eleven Copies for Twenty Dollars, (postage unpaid.)\r\nSingle numbers can be procured of any News-dealer in the United States.\r\nThe KNICKERBOCKER MAGAZINE and the CONTINENTAL MONTHLY will be furnished\r\nfor one year at FOUR DOLLARS.\r\n\r\nAppreciating the importance of literature to the soldier on duty, the\r\nPublisher will send the CONTINENTAL _gratis_, to any regiment in active\r\nservice, on application being made by its COLONEL or Chaplain; he will\r\nalso receive subscriptions from those desiring to furnish it to soldiers\r\nin the ranks at half the regular price; but in such cases it must be\r\nmailed from the office of publication.\r\n\r\n  J.R.

It was started at a period when\r\nany new literary enterprise was deemed almost foolhardy, but the\r\npublisher believed that the time had arrived for just such a Magazine.\r\nFearlessly advocating the doctrine of ultimate and gradual Emancipation,\r\nfor the sake of the UNION and the WHITE MAN, it has found favor in\r\nquarters where censure was expected, and patronage where opposition only\r\nwas looked for. While holding firmly to its _own opinions_, it has\r\nopened its pages to POLITICAL WRITERS _of widely different views_, and\r\nhas made a feature of employing the literary labors of the younger race\r\nof American writers. How much has been gained by thus giving,\r\npractically, the fullest freedom to the expression of opinion, and by\r\nthe infusion of fresh blood into literature, has been felt from month to\r\nmonth in its constantly increasing circulation.\r\n\r\nThe most eminent of our Statesmen have furnished THE CONTINENTAL many of\r\nits political articles, and the result is, it has not given labored\r\nessays fit only for a place in ponderous encyclopedias, but fresh,\r\nvigorous, and practical contributions on men and things as they exist.\r\n\r\nIt will be our effort to go on in the path we have entered, and as a\r\nguarantee of the future, we may point to the array of live and brilliant\r\ntalent which has brought so many encomiums on our Magazine. The able\r\npolitical articles which have given it so much reputation will be\r\ncontinued in each issue, and in the next number will be commenced a New\r\nSerial by Richard B. Kimball, the eminent author of the 'Under-Currents\r\nof Wall-Street,' 'St. Leger,' etc., entitled,\r\n\r\n  WAS HE SUCCESSFUL?\r\n\r\nAn account of the Life and Conduct of Hiram Meeker, one of the leading\r\nmen in the mercantile community, and 'a bright and shining light' in the\r\nChurch, recounting what he did, and how he made his money.\r\n\r\nA work which will excel the previous brilliant productions of this\r\nauthor.\r\n\r\nThe UNION--The Union of ALL THE STATES--that indicates our politics. To\r\nbe content with no ground lower than the highest--that is the standard\r\nof our literary character.\r\n\r\nWe hope all who are friendly to the spread of our political views, and\r\nall who are favorable to the diffusion of a live, fresh, and energetic\r\nliterature, will lend us their aid to increase our circulation. There is\r\nnot one of our readers who may not influence one or two more, and there\r\nis in every town in the loyal States some active person whose time might\r\nbe profitably employed in procuring subscribers to our work. To\r\nencourage such to act for us we offer the following very liberal\r\n\r\n   TERMS TO CLUBS.\r\n\r\n   Two copies for one year,   Five dollars.\r\n   Three copies for one year,   Six dollars.\r\n   Six copies for one year,   Eleven dollars.\r\n   Eleven copies for one year,   Twenty dollars.\r\n   Twenty copies for one year,   Thirty-six dollars.\r\n\r\n   PAID IN ADVANCE.\r\n\r\n   _Postage, Thirty-six Cents a year_, TO BE PAID BY THE SUBSCRIBER.\r\n\r\n  SINGLE COPIES.\r\n\r\n   Three Dollars a year, IN ADVANCE.--_Postage paid by the Publisher_.\r\n\r\n   J.R.

'embroidered stuff,' (meaning, of course,\r\nembroidered or ornamented stuff in general,) we have Mien, which\r\nsignifies 'fine silk.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote J: Montesinos, _Mem. Antiguas_, MS. lib. 2, cap. 7. _Vide\r\nPrescott's Conquest of Peru_, Book I. p. 128.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote K: The narrative of these early voyages is preserved in\r\nHakluyt's great _History of the Voyages and Discoveries of the English\r\nNation_, and this and the following extracts are taken from Vol. III.,\r\npublished in 1600. Americana are under great obligations to this\r\nfaithful old chronicler.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote L: Lane often refers to the Chesapeans, a tribe who dwelt on\r\nthe Elizabeth River, probably at about the present site of Norfolk, and\r\ndown to Old Point Comfort. The word Chesapeake is compounded from _Che_,\r\ngreat, _sepe_ or _sepo_, river, and _peak_, a white shell, meaning\r\n'great river of shells,' and probably referred to the mouth of James\r\nRiver. _Roanoak_ means a black shell.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote M: This was no doubt what is now known as 'Old Point Comfort.'\r\nThe position would have been well chosen for defense against his\r\nenemies. The Indians knew no difference between an island and a\r\npeninsula, and Old Point has but a very narrow connection with the main\r\nland.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote N: This was undoubtedly Wampum or Wampeage.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote O: A celebrated traveler asserts that tobacco, now extended\r\nover both hemispheres, is an evidence of civilization.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote P: 'To all Christian People to whom these Presents shall come,\r\nGreeting, know ye that I Sr William Berkeley Knt Capt Generall and chief\r\nGovernor of Virginia and One of the Proprietors of Carolina and\r\nAlbemarle Send Greeting Know ye that I the sd Sr William Berkeley for\r\nand in consideration of ye Sum of one hundred pounds sterling to me in\r\nhand already paid or secured to be paid, have bargained, sold, agreed,\r\nalienated, enfeoffed and confirmed and by these presents Do fully,\r\nclearly and absolutely bargain, sell, alienate enfoeffe and confirm unto\r\nJoshua Lamb of New England, Merchant, the whole Island of Roanoke\r\nSituate and being in the county of Albemarle in the province of\r\nCarolina, Together with what is thereon standing growing or being, with\r\nall ye profits, privileges and advantages thereto belonging or in any\r\nwise appertaining and also all the cattle, hoggs and other stock, with\r\nthe marshes, houses and buildings thereon to the sd Joshua Lamb.
