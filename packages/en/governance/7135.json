This fact, and the processes by which the\r\nConspirators worked, is very well stated, in his documentary \"History of\r\nthe Rebellion,\" by Edward McPherson, when he says: \"In the Slaveholding\r\nStates, a considerable body of men have always been disaffected to the\r\nUnion.  They resisted the adoption of the National Constitution, then\r\nsought to refine away the rights and powers of the General Government,\r\nand by artful expedients, in a series of years, using the excitements\r\ngrowing out of passing questions, finally perverted the sentiments of\r\nlarge masses of men, and prepared them for Revolution.\"\r\n\r\nBefore giving further incontestable proofs establishing this fact, and\r\nbefore endeavoring to sift out the true cause or causes of Secession,\r\nlet us first examine such evidences as are submitted by him in support\r\nof his proposition.\r\n\r\nThe first piece of testimony, is an extract from an unpublished journal\r\nof U. S. Senator Maclay of Pennsylvania, from March 4, 1789, to March 3,\r\n1791--the period of the First Congress under the Federal Constitution.\r\nIt runs thus:\r\n\r\n\"1789, June 9.--In relation to the Tariff Bill, the affair of confining\r\nthe East India Trade to the citizens of America had been negatived, and\r\na committee had been appointed to report on this business.  The report\r\ncame in with very high duties, amounting to a prohibition.  But a new\r\nphenomenon had made its appearance in the House (meaning the Senate)\r\nsince Friday.\r\n\r\n\"Pierce Butler, from South Carolina, had taken his seat, and flamed like\r\na meteor.  He arraigned the whole Impost law, and then charged\r\n(indirectly) the whole Congress with a design of oppressing South\r\nCarolina.  He cried out for encouraging the Danes and Swedes, and\r\nforeigners of every kind, to come and take away our produce.  In fact he\r\nwas for a Navigation Act reversed.\r\n\r\n\"June 11.--Attended at the hall as usual.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Ralph Izard and Mr. Butler opposed the whole of the drawbacks in\r\nevery shape whatever.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. (William) Grayson, of Virginia, warm on this subject, said we were\r\nnot ripe for such a thing.  We were a new Nation, and had no business\r\nfor any such regulations--a Nation /sui generis/.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. (Richard Henry) Lee (of Virginia) said drawbacks were right, but\r\nwould be so much abused, he could not think of admitting them.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. (Oliver) Ellsworth (of Connecticut) said New England rum would be\r\nexported, instead of West India, to obtain the drawback.\r\n\r\n\"I thought it best to say a few words in reply to each.  We were a new\r\nNation, it was true, but we were not a new People.  We were composed of\r\nindividuals of like manners, habits, and customs with the European\r\nNations.  What, therefore, had been found useful among them, came well\r\nrecommended by experience to us.  Drawbacks stand as an example in this\r\npoint of view to us.  If the thing was right in itself, there could be\r\nno just argument drawn against the use of a thing from the abuse of it.\r\nIt would be the duty of Government to guard against abuses, by prudent\r\nappointments and watchful attention to officers.  That as to changing\r\nthe kind of rum, I thought the collection Bill would provide for this,\r\nby limiting the exportation to the original casks and packages.  I said\r\na great deal more, but really did not feel much interest either way.\r\nBut the debates were very lengthy.\r\n\r\n\"Butler flamed away, and THREATENED A DISSOLUTION OF THE UNION, with\r\nregard to his State, as sure as God was in the firmament.  He scattered\r\nhis remarks over the whole Impost bill, calling it partial, oppressive,\r\netc., and solely calculated to oppress South Carolina, and yet ever and\r\nanon declaring how clear of local views and how candid and dispassionate\r\nhe was.  He degenerates into mere declamation.  His State would live\r\nfree, or die glorious.\"\r\n\r\nThe next piece of evidence is General Jackson's letter to Rev. A. J.\r\nCrawford, as follows:\r\n\r\n[\"Private.\"]\r\n\r\n\"WASHINGTON, May 1, 1833.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SIR: * * * I have had a laborious task here, but Nullification\r\nis dead; and its actors and courtiers will only be remembered by the\r\nPeople to be execrated for their wicked designs to sever and destroy the\r\nonly good Government on the globe, and that prosperity and happiness we\r\nenjoy over every other portion of the World.  Haman's gallows ought to\r\nbe the fate of all such ambitious men who would involve their Country in\r\nCivil War, and all the evils in its train, that they might reign and\r\nride on its whirlwinds and direct the storm.  The Free People of these\r\nUnited States have spoken, and consigned these wicked demagogues to\r\ntheir proper doom.  Take care of your Nullifiers; you have them among\r\nyou; let them meet with the indignant frowns of every man who loves his\r\nCountry.  The Tariff, it is now known, was a mere pretext--its burden\r\nwas on your coarse woolens.  By the law of July, 1832, coarse woolen was\r\nreduced to five per cent., for the benefit of the South.  Mr. Clay's\r\nBill takes it up and classes it with woolens at fifty per cent., reduces\r\nit gradually down to twenty per cent., and there it is to remain, and\r\nMr. Calhoun and all the Nullifiers agree to the principle.  The cash\r\nduties and home valuation will be equal to fifteen per cent. more, and\r\nafter the year 1842, you pay on coarse woolens thirty-five per cent.  If\r\nthis is not Protection, I cannot understand; therefore the Tariff was\r\nonly the pretext, and Disunion and a Southern Confederacy the real\r\nobject.  The next pretext will be the Negro or Slavery question.\r\n\r\n\"My health is not good, but is improving a little.  Present me kindly to\r\nyour lady and family, and believe me to be your friend.  I will always\r\nbe happy to hear from you.\r\n                         \"ANDREW JACKSON.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother evidence is given in the following extract from Benton's \"Thirty\r\nYears in the Senate,\" vol. ii., as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The regular inauguration of this Slavery agitation dates from the year\r\n1835; but it had commenced two years before, and in this way:\r\nNullification and Disunion had commenced in 1830, upon complaint against\r\nProtective Tariff.  That, being put down in 1833 under President\r\nJackson's proclamation and energetic measures, was immediately\r\nsubstituted by the Slavery agitation.  Mr. Calhoun, when he went home\r\nfrom Congress in the spring of that year, told his friends that 'the\r\nSouth could never be united against the North on the Tariff question\r\n--that the sugar interest of Louisiana would keep her out--and that the\r\nbasis of Southern Union must be shifted to the Slave question.'  Then\r\nall the papers in his interest, and especially the one at Washington,\r\npublished by Mr. Duff Green, dropped Tariff agitation, and commenced\r\nupon Slavery, and in two years had the agitation ripe for inauguration,\r\non the Slavery question.  And in tracing this agitation to its present\r\nstage, and to comprehend its rationale, it is not to be forgotten that\r\nit is a mere continuation of old Tariff Disunion, and preferred because\r\nmore available.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, from p. 490 of his private correspondence, Mr. Clay's words to an\r\nAlabamian, in 1844, are thus given:\r\n\r\n\"From the developments now being made in South Carolina, it is perfectly\r\nmanifest that a Party exists in that State seeking a Dissolution of the\r\nUnion, and for that purpose employ the pretext of the rejection of Mr.\r\nTyler's abominable treaty.  South Carolina, being surrounded by Slave\r\nStates, would, in the event of a Dissolution of the Union, suffer only\r\ncomparative evils; but it is otherwise with Kentucky.  She has the\r\nboundary of the Ohio extending four hundred miles on three Free States.\r\nWhat would our condition be in the event of the greatest calamity that\r\ncould befall this Nation?\"\r\n\r\nAllusion is also made to a letter written by Representative Nathan\r\nAppleton, of Boston, December 15, 1860, in which that gentleman said\r\nthat when he was in Congress--in 1832-33--he had \"made up his mind that\r\nMessrs. Calhoun, Hayne, McDuffie, etc., were desirous of a separation of\r\nthe Slave States into a separate Confederacy, as more favorable to the\r\nsecurity of Slave Property.\"\r\n\r\nAfter mentioning that \"About 1835, some South Carolinians attempted a\r\nDisunion demonstration,\" our authority says: It is thus described by\r\nex-Governor Francis Thomas of Maryland, in his speech in Baltimore,\r\nOctober 29, 1861:\r\n\r\n\"Full twenty years ago, when occupying my seat in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, I was surprised one morning, after the assembling of\r\nthe House, to observe that all the members from the Slaveholding States\r\nwere absent.  Whilst reflecting on this strange occurrence, I was asked\r\nwhy I was not in attendance on the Southern Caucus assembled in the room\r\nof the Committee on Claims.  I replied that I had received no\r\ninvitation.\r\n\r\n\"I then proposed to go to the Committee-room to see what was being done.\r\nWhen I entered, I found that little cock-sparrow, Governor Pickens, of\r\nSouth Carolina, addressing the meeting, and strutting about like a\r\nrooster around a barn-yard coop, discussing the following resolution:\r\n\r\n\"' Resolved, That no member of Congress, representing a Southern\r\nconstituency, shall again take his seat until a resolution is passed\r\nsatisfactory to the South on the subject of Slavery.'\r\n\r\n\"I listened to his language, and when he had finished, I obtained the\r\nfloor, asking to be permitted to take part in the discussion.  I\r\ndetermined at once to kill the Treasonable plot hatched by John C.\r\nCalhoun, the Catiline of America, by asking questions.  I said to Mr.\r\nPickens, 'What next do you propose we shall do? are we to tell the\r\nPeople that Republicanism is a failure?  If you are for that, I am not.\r\nI came here to sustain and uphold American institutions; to defend the\r\nrights of the North as well as the South; to secure harmony and good\r\nfellowship between all Sections of our common Country.' They dared not\r\nanswer these questions.  The Southern temper had not then been gotten\r\nup.  As my questions were not answered, I moved an adjournment of the\r\nCaucus /sine die/.  Mr. Craig, of Virginia, seconded the motion, and the\r\ncompany was broken up.  We returned to the House, and Mr. Ingersoll, of\r\nPennsylvania, a glorious patriot then as now, introduced a resolution\r\nwhich temporarily calmed the excitement.\"\r\n\r\nThe remarks upon this statement, made November 4, 1861, by the National\r\nIntelligencer, were as follows:\r\n\r\n\"However busy Mr. Pickens may have been in the Caucus after it met, the\r\nmost active man in getting it up and pressing the Southern members to go\r\ninto it, was Mr. R.  B. Rhett, also a member from South Carolina.  The\r\noccasion, or alleged cause of this withdrawal from the House into secret\r\ndeliberation was an anti-Slavery speech of Mr. Slade, of Vermont, which\r\nMr. Rhett violently denounced, and proposed to the Southern members to\r\nleave the House and go into Conclave in one of the Committee-rooms,\r\nwhich they generally did, if not all of them.  We are able to state,\r\nhowever, what may not have been known to Governor Thomas, that at least\r\nthree besides himself, of those who did attend it, went there with a\r\npurpose very different from an intention to consent to any Treasonable\r\nmeasure.  These three men were Henry A.  Wise, Balie Peyton, and William\r\nCost Johnson.  Neither of them opened his lips in the Caucus; they went\r\nto observe; and we can assure Governor Thomas, that if Mr. Pickens or\r\nMr. Calhoun, (whom he names) or any one else had presented a distinct\r\nproposition looking to Disunion, or Revolt, or Secession, he would have\r\nwitnessed a scene not soon to be forgotten.  The three whom we have\r\nmentioned were as brave as they were determined.  Fortunately, perhaps,\r\nthe man whom they went particularly to watch, remained silent and\r\npassive.\"\r\n\r\nLet us, however, pursue the inquiry a little further.  On the 14th of\r\nNovember, 1860, Alexander H. Stephens addressed the Legislature of\r\nGeorgia, and in a portion of that address--replying to a speech made\r\nbefore the same Body the previous evening by Mr. Toombs, in which the\r\nlatter had \"recounted the evils of this Government\"--said:\r\n\r\n\"The first [of these evils] was the Fishing Bounties, paid mostly to the\r\nsailors of New England.  Our friend stated that forty-eight years of our\r\nGovernment was under the administration of Southern Presidents.  Well,\r\nthese Fishing Bounties began under the rule of a Southern President, I\r\nbelieve.  No one of them, during the whole forty-eight years, ever set\r\nhis Administration against the principle or policy of them.  * * *\r\n\r\n\"The next evil which my friend complained of, was the Tariff.  Well, let\r\nus look at that for a moment.  About the time I commenced noticing\r\npublic matters, this question was agitating the Country almost as\r\nfearfully as the Slave question now is.  In 1832, when I was in college,\r\nSouth Carolina was ready to Nullify or Secede from the Union on this\r\naccount.  And what have we seen?  The Tariff no longer distracts the\r\npublic counsels.  Reason has triumphed!  The present Tariff was voted\r\nfor by Massachusetts and South Carolina.  The lion and the lamb lay down\r\ntogether--every man in the Senate and House from Massachusetts and South\r\nCarolina, I think, voted for it, as did my honorable friend himself.\r\nAnd if it be true, to use the figure of speech of my honorable friend,\r\nthat every man in the North that works in iron, and brass and wood, has\r\nhis muscle strengthened by the protection of the Government, that\r\nstimulant was given by his vote and I believe (that of) every other\r\nSouthern man.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. TOOMBS--The Tariff lessened the duties.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. STEPHENS--Yes, and Massachusetts with unanimity voted with the\r\nSouth to lessen them, and they were made just as low as Southern men\r\nasked them to be, and that is the rate they are now at.  If reason and\r\nargument, with experience, produced such changes in the sentiments of\r\nMassachusetts from 1832 to 1857, on the subject of the Tariff, may not\r\nlike changes be effected there by the same means--reason and argument,\r\nand appeals to patriotism on the present vexed question?  And who can\r\nsay that by 1875 or 1890, Massachusetts may not vote with South Carolina\r\nand Georgia upon all those questions that now distract the Country and\r\nthreaten its peace and existence.\r\n\r\n\"Another matter of grievance alluded to by my honorable friend was the\r\nNavigation Laws.  This policy was also commenced under the\r\nAdministration of one of these Southern Presidents who ruled so well,\r\nand has been continued through all of them since. * * * One of the\r\nobjects (of these) was to build up a commercial American marine by\r\ngiving American bottoms the exclusive Carrying Trade between our own\r\nports.  This is a great arm of national power.  This object was\r\naccomplished.  We have now an amount of shipping, not only coastwise,\r\nbut to foreign countries, which puts us in the front rank of the Nations\r\nof the World.  England can no longer be styled the Mistress of the Seas.\r\nWhat American is not proud of the result?  Whether those laws should be\r\ncontinued is another question.  But one thing is certain; no President,\r\nNorthern or Southern, has ever yet recommended their repeal. * * *\r\n\r\n\"These then were the true main grievances or grounds of complaint\r\nagainst the general system of our Government and its workings--I mean\r\nthe administration of the Federal Government.  As to the acts of the\r\nfederal States I shall speak presently: but these three were the main\r\nones used against the common head.  Now, suppose it be admitted that all\r\nof these are evils in the system; do they overbalance and outweigh the\r\nadvantages and great good which this same Government affords in a\r\nthousand innumerable ways that cannot be estimated?  Have we not at the\r\nSouth, as well as the North, grown great, prosperous, and happy under\r\nits operations?  Has any part of the World ever shown such rapid\r\nprogress in the development of wealth, and all the material resources of\r\nnational power and greatness, as the Southern States have under the\r\nGeneral Government, notwithstanding all its defects?\r\n\r\n\"Mr. TOOMBS--In spite of it.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. STEPHENS--My honorable friend says we have, in spite of the General\r\nGovernment; that without it, I suppose he thinks, we might have done as\r\nwell, or perhaps better, than we have done in spite of it.  * * *\r\nWhether we of the South would have been better off without the\r\nGovernment, is, to say the least, problematical.  On the one side we can\r\nonly put the fact, against speculation and conjecture on the other.  * *\r\n*  The influence of the Government on us is like that of the atmosphere\r\naround us.  Its benefits are so silent and unseen that they are seldom\r\nthought of or appreciated.\r\n\r\n\"We seldom think of the single element of oxygen in the air we breathe,\r\nand yet let this simple, unseen and unfelt agent be withdrawn, this\r\nlife-giving element be taken away from this all-pervading fluid around\r\nus, and what instant and appalling changes would take place in all\r\norganic creation.\r\n\r\n\"It may be that we are all that we are 'in spite of the General\r\nGovernment,' but it may be that without it we should have been far\r\ndifferent from what we are now.  It is true that there is no equal part\r\nof the Earth with natural resources superior perhaps to ours.  That\r\nportion of this Country known as the Southern States, stretching from\r\nthe Chesapeake to the Rio Grande, is fully equal to the picture drawn by\r\nthe honorable and eloquent Senator last night, in all natural\r\ncapacities.  But how many ages and centuries passed before these\r\ncapacities were developed to reach this advanced age of civilization.\r\nThere these same hills, rich in ore, same rivers, same valleys and\r\nplains, are as they have been since they came from the hand of the\r\nCreator; uneducated and uncivilized man roamed over them for how long no\r\nhistory informs us.\r\n\r\n\"It was only under our institutions that they could be developed.  Their\r\ndevelopment is the result of the enterprise of our people, under\r\noperations of the Government and institutions under which we have lived.\r\nEven our people, without these, never would have done it.  The\r\norganization of society has much to do with the development of the\r\nnatural resources of any Country or any Land.  The institutions of a\r\nPeople, political and moral, are the matrix in which the germ of their\r\norganic structure quickens into life--takes root, and develops in form,\r\nnature, and character.  Our institutions constitute the basis, the\r\nmatrix, from which spring all our characteristics of development and\r\ngreatness.  Look at Greece.  There is the same fertile soil, the same\r\nblue sky, the same inlets and harbors, the same AEgean, the same\r\nOlympus; there is the same land where Homer sung, where Pericles spoke;\r\nit is in nature the same old Greece--but it is living Greece no more.\r\n\r\n\"Descendants of the same people inhabit the country; yet what is the\r\nreason of this vast difference?  In the midst of present degradation we\r\nsee the glorious fragments of ancient works of art-temples, with\r\nornaments and inscriptions that excite wonder and admiration--the\r\nremains of a once high order of civilization, which have outlived the\r\nlanguage they spoke--upon them all, Ichabod is written--their glory has\r\ndeparted.  Why is this so?  I answer, their institutions have been\r\ndestroyed.  These were but the fruits of their forms of government, the\r\nmatrix from which their great development sprang; and when once the\r\ninstitutions of a People have been destroyed, there is no earthly power\r\nthat can bring back the Promethean spark to kindle them here again, any\r\nmore than in that ancient land of eloquence, poetry and song.\r\n\r\n\"The same may be said of Italy.  Where is Rome, once the mistress of the\r\nWorld?  There are the same seven hills now, the same soil, the same\r\nnatural resources; the nature is the same, but what a ruin of human\r\ngreatness meets the eye of the traveler throughout the length and\r\nbreadth of that most down-trodden land! why have not the People of that\r\nHeaven-favored clime, the spirit that animated their fathers?  Why this\r\nsad difference?\r\n\r\n\"It is the destruction of their institutions that has caused it; and, my\r\ncountrymen, if we shall in an evil hour rashly pull down and destroy\r\nthose institutions which the patriotic hand of our fathers labored so\r\nlong and so hard to build up, and which have done so much for us and the\r\nWorld, who can venture the prediction that similar results will not\r\nensue?  Let us avoid it if we can.  I trust the spirit is among us that\r\nwill enable us to do it.  Let us not rashly try the experiment, for, if\r\nit fails, as it did in Greece and Italy, and in the South American\r\nRepublics, and in every other place wherever liberty is once destroyed,\r\nit may never be restored to us again.\r\n\r\n\"There are defects in our government, errors in administration, and\r\nshort-comings of many kinds; but in spite of these defects and errors,\r\nGeorgia has grown to be a great State.  Let us pause here a moment.\r\n\r\n\"When I look around and see our prosperity in everything, agriculture,\r\ncommerce, art, science, and every department of education, physical and\r\nmental, as well as moral advancement--and our colleges--I think, in the\r\nface of such an exhibition, if we can, without the loss of power, or any\r\nessential right or interest, remain in the Union, it is our duty to\r\nourselves and to posterity--let us not too readily yield to this\r\ntemptation--to do so.  Our first parents, the great progenitors of the\r\nhuman race, were not without a like temptation, when in the Garden of\r\nEden.  They were led to believe that their condition would be bettered\r\n--that their eyes would be opened--and that they would become as gods.\r\nThey in an evil hour yielded--instead of becoming gods they only saw\r\ntheir own nakedness.\r\n\r\n\"I look upon this Country, with our institutions, as the Eden of the\r\nWorld, the Paradise of the Universe.  It may be that out of it we may\r\nbecome greater and more prosperous, but I am candid and sincere in\r\ntelling you that I fear if we rashly evince passion, and without\r\nsufficient cause shall take that step, that instead of becoming greater\r\nor more peaceful, prosperous, and happy--instead of becoming gods, we\r\nwill become demons, and at no distant day commence cutting one another's\r\nthroats.  This is my apprehension.\r\n\r\n\"Let us, therefore, whatever we do, meet those difficulties, great as\r\nthey are, like wise and sensible men, and consider them in the light of\r\nall the consequences which may attend our action.  Let us see first\r\nclearly where the path of duty leads, and then we may not fear to tread\r\ntherein.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSaid Senator Wigfall, of Texas, March 4, 1861, in the United States\r\nSenate, only a few hours before Mr. Lincoln's Inauguration:\r\n\r\n\"I desire to pour oil on the waters, to produce harmony, peace and quiet\r\nhere.  It is early in the morning, and I hope I shall not say anything\r\nthat may be construed as offensive.  I rise merely that we may have an\r\nunderstanding of this question.\r\n\r\n\"It is not Slavery in the Territories, it is not expansion, which is the\r\ndifficulty.  If the resolution which the Senator from Wisconsin\r\nintroduced here, denying the right of Secession, had been adopted by\r\ntwo-thirds of each branch of this department of the Government, and had\r\nbeen ratified by three-fourths of the States, I have no hesitation in\r\nsaying that, so far as the State in which I live and to which I owe my\r\nallegiance is concerned, if she had no other cause for a disruption of\r\nthe Union taking place, she would undoubtedly have gone out.\r\n\r\n     [To insert as an additional article of amendment to the\r\n     Constitution, the following: \"Under this Constitution, as\r\n     originally adopted, and as it now exists, no State has power to\r\n     withdraw from the jurisdiction of the United States: but this\r\n     Constitution, and all laws passed in pursuance of its delegated\r\n     powers, are the Supreme Law of the Land, anything contained in any\r\n     constitution, ordinance, or act of any State, to the contrary\r\n     notwithstanding.\"]\r\n\r\n\"The moment you deny the right of self-government to the free White men\r\nof the South, they will leave the Government.  They believe in the\r\nDeclaration of Independence.  They believe that:\r\n\r\n\"'Governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from\r\nthe consent of the governed; that, whenever any form of government\r\nbecomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the People to\r\nalter or to abolish it, and to institute a new Government, laying its\r\nfoundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as\r\nto them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.'\r\n\r\n\"That principle of the Declaration of Independence is the one upon which\r\nthe free White men of the South predicated their devotion to the present\r\nConstitution of the United States; and it was the denial of that, as\r\nmuch as anything else, that has created the dissatisfaction in that\r\nSection of the Country.\r\n\r\n\"There is no instrument of writing that has ever been written that has\r\nbeen more misapprehended and misunderstood and misrepresented than this\r\nsame unfortunate Declaration of Independence, and no set of gentlemen\r\nhave ever been so slandered as the fathers who drew and signed that\r\nDeclaration.\r\n\r\n\"If there was a thing on earth that they did not intend to assert, it\r\nwas that a Negro was a White man.  As I said here, a short time ago, one\r\nof the greatest charges they made against the British Government was,\r\nthat old King George was attempting to establish the fact practically\r\nthat all men were created Free and Equal.  They charged him in the\r\nDeclaration of Independence with inciting their Slaves to insurrection.\r\nThat is one of the grounds upon which they threw off their allegiance to\r\nthe British Parliament.\r\n\r\n\"Another great misapprehension is, that the men who drafted that\r\nDeclaration of Independence had any peculiar fancy for one form of\r\ngovernment rather than another.  They were not fighting to establish a\r\nDemocracy in this country; they were not fighting to establish a\r\nRepublican form of government in this Country.  Nothing was further from\r\ntheir intention.\r\n\r\n\"Alexander Hamilton, after he had fought for seven years, declared that\r\nthe British form of government was the best that the ingenuity of man\r\nhad ever devised; and when John Adams said to him, 'without its\r\ncorruptions;'  'Why,' said he, 'its corruptions are its greatest\r\nexcellence; without the corruptions, it would be nothing.'\r\n\r\n\"In the Declaration of Independence, they speak of George III., after\r\nthis fashion.  They say:\r\n\r\n\"'A prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define\r\na tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free People.'\r\n\r\n\"Now, I ask any plain common-sense man what was the meaning of that?\r\nWas it that they were opposed to a Monarchical form of government?  Was\r\nit that they believed a Monarchical form of government was incompatible\r\nwith civil liberty?  No, sir; they entertained no such absurd idea.\r\nNone of them entertained it; but they say that George III, was a prince\r\nwhose character was 'marked by every act which may define a tyrant' and\r\nthat therefore he was 'unfit to be the ruler of a free People.'  Had his\r\ncharacter not been so marked by every quality which would define a\r\ntyrant, he might have been the fit ruler of a free People; ergo, a\r\nmonarchical form of Government was not incompatible with civil liberty.\r\n\r\n\"That was clearly the opinion of those men.  I do not advocate it now;\r\nfor I have said frequently that we are wiser than our fathers, and our\r\nchildren will be wiser than we are.  One hundred years hence, men will\r\nunderstand their own affairs much better than we do.  We understand our\r\naffairs better than those who preceded us one hundred years.  But what I\r\nassert is, that the men of the Revolution did not believe that a\r\nMonarchical form of Government was incompatible with civil liberty.\r\n\r\n\"What I assert is, that when they spoke of 'all men being created\r\nequal,' they were speaking of the White men who then had unsheathed\r\ntheir swords--for what purpose?  To establish the right of\r\nself-government in themselves; and when they had achieved that, they\r\nestablished, not Democracies, but Republican forms of Government in\r\nthe thirteen sovereign, separate and independent Colonies.  Yet the\r\nDeclaration of Independence is constantly quoted to prove Negro\r\nequality.  It proves no such thing; it was intended to prove no such\r\nthing.\r\n\r\n\"The 'glittering generalities' which a distinguished former Senator from\r\nMassachusetts (Mr. Choate) spoke of, as contained in the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, one of them at least, about all men being created equal\r\n--was not original with Mr. Jefferson.  I recollect seeing a pamphlet\r\ncalled the Principles of the Whigs and Jacobites, published about the\r\nyear 1745, when the last of the Stuarts, called 'the Pretender,' was\r\nstriking a blow that was fatal to himself, but a blow for his crown, in\r\nwhich pamphlet the very phraseology is used, word for word and letter\r\nfor letter.  I have not got it here to-night.  I sent the other day to\r\nthe Library to try and find it, but could not find it; it was burnt, I\r\nbelieve, with the pamphlets that were burnt some time ago.\r\n\r\n\"That Mr. Jefferson copied it or plagiarized it, is not true, I suppose,\r\nany more than the charge that the distinguished Senator from New York\r\nplagiarized from the Federalist in preparing his celebrated compromising\r\nspeech which was made here a short time ago.  It was the cant phrase of\r\nthe day in 1745, which was only about thirty years previous to the\r\nDeclaration of Independence.  This particular pamphlet, which I have\r\nread, was published; others were published at the same time.  That sort\r\nof phraseology was used.\r\n\r\n\"There was a war of classes in England; there were men who were\r\ncontending for legitimacy; who were contending for the right of the\r\nCrown being inherent and depending on the will of God, 'the divine right\r\nof Kings,' for maintaining an hereditary landed-aristocracy; there was\r\nanother Party who were contending against this doctrine of legitimacy,\r\nand the right of primogeniture.  These were called the Whigs; they\r\nestablished this general phraseology in denouncing the divine right and\r\nthe doctrine of legitimacy, and it became the common phraseology of the\r\nCountry; so that in the obscure county of Mecklenburg, in North\r\nCarolina, a declaration containing the same assertions was found as in\r\nthis celebrated Declaration of Independence, written by the immortal\r\nJefferson.\r\n\r\n\"Which of us, I ask, is there upon this floor who has not read and\r\nre-read whatever was written within the last twenty-five or thirty years\r\nby the distinguished men of this country?  But enough of that.\r\n\r\n\"As I said before, there ought not have been, and there did not\r\nnecessarily result from our form of Government, any irrepressible\r\nconflict between the Slaveholding and the non-Slaveholding States.\r\nNothing of the sort was necessary.\r\n\r\n\"Strike out a single clause in the Constitution of the United States,\r\nthat which secures to each State a Republican form of Government, and\r\nthere is no reason why, under precisely such a Constitution as we have,\r\nStates that are Monarchical and States that are Republican, could not\r\nlive in peace and quiet.  They confederate together for common defense\r\nand general welfare, each State regulating its domestic concerns in its\r\nown way; those which preferred a Republican form of Government\r\nmaintaining it, and those which preferred a Monarchical form of\r\nGovernment maintaining it.\r\n\r\n\"But how long could small States, with different forms of Government,\r\nlive together, confederated for common defense and general welfare, if\r\nthe people of one Section were to come to the conclusion that their\r\ninstitutions were better than those of the other, and thereupon\r\nstraightway set about subverting the institutions of the other?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the reply of the Rebel \"Commissioners of the Southern Confederacy\"\r\nto Mr. Seward, April 9, 1861, they speak of our Government as being\r\n\"persistently wedded to those fatal theories of construction of the\r\nFederal Constitution always rejected by the statesmen of the South, and\r\nadhered to by those of the Administration school, until they have\r\nproduced their natural and often-predicted result of the destruction of\r\nthe Union, under which we might have continued to live happily and\r\ngloriously together, had the spirit of the ancestry who framed the\r\ncommon Constitution animated the hearts of all their sons.\"\r\n\r\nIn the \"Address of the people of South Carolina, assembled in\r\nConvention, to the people of the Slaveholding States of the United\r\nStates,\" by which the attempt was made to justify the passage of the\r\nSouth Carolina Secession Ordinance of 1860, it is declared that:\r\n\r\n\"Discontent and contention have moved in the bosom of the Confederacy,\r\nfor the last thirty-five years.  During this time South Carolina has\r\ntwice called her people together in solemn Convention, to take into\r\nconsideration, the aggressions and unconstitutional wrongs, perpetrated\r\nby the people of the North on the people of the South.  These wrongs\r\nwere submitted to by the people of the South, under the hope and\r\nexpectation that they would be final.  But such hope and expectation\r\nhave proved to be vain.  Instead of producing forbearance, our\r\nacquiescence has only instigated to new forms of aggressions and\r\noutrage; and South Carolina, having again assembled her people in\r\nConvention, has this day dissolved her connection with the States\r\nconstituting the United States.\r\n\r\n\"The one great evil from which all other evils have flowed, is the\r\noverthrow of the Constitution of the United States.  The Government of\r\nthe United States, is no longer the Government of Confederated\r\nRepublics, but of a consolidated Democracy.  It is no longer a free\r\nGovernment, but a Despotism.  It is, in fact, such a Government as Great\r\nBritain attempted to set over our Fathers; and which was resisted and\r\ndefeated by a seven years struggle for Independence.\r\n\r\n\"The Revolution of 1776, turned upon one great principle,\r\nself-government,--and self-taxation, the criterion of self-government.\r\n\r\n\"The Southern States now stand exactly in the same position towards the\r\nNorthern States, that the Colonies did towards Great Britain.  The\r\nNorthern States, having the majority in Congress, claim the same power\r\nof omnipotence in legislation as the British Parliament.  'The General\r\nWelfare' is the only limit to the legislation of either; and the\r\nmajority in Congress, as in the British Parliament, are the sole judges\r\nof the expediency of the legislation this 'General Welfare' requires.\r\nThus the Government of the United States has become a consolidated\r\nGovernment; and the people of the Southern States are compelled to meet\r\nthe very despotism their fathers threw off in the Revolution of 1776.\r\n\r\n\"The consolidation of the Government of Great Britain over the Colonies,\r\nwas attempted to be carried out by the taxes.  The British Parliament\r\nundertook to tax the Colonies to promote British interests.  Our fathers\r\nresisted this pretension.  They claimed the right of self-taxation\r\nthrough their Colonial Legislatures.  They were not represented in the\r\nBritish Parliament, and, therefore, could not rightly be taxed by its\r\nlegislation.  The British Government, however, offered them a\r\nrepresentation in Parliament; but it was not sufficient to enable them\r\nto protect themselves from the majority, and they refused the offer.\r\nBetween taxation without any representation, and taxation without a\r\nrepresentation adequate to protection, there was no difference.  In\r\nneither case would the Colonies tax themselves.  Hence, they refused to\r\npay the taxes laid by the British Parliament.\r\n\r\n\"And so with the Southern States, towards the Northern States, in the\r\nvital matter of taxation.  They are in a minority in Congress.  Their\r\nrepresentation in Congress is useless to protect them against unjust\r\ntaxation; and they are taxed by the people of the North for their\r\nbenefit, exactly as the people of Great Britain taxed our ancestors in\r\nthe British Parliament for their benefit.  For the last forty years, the\r\ntaxes laid by the Congress of the United States have been laid with a\r\nview of subserving the interests of the North.  The people of the South\r\nhave been taxed by duties on imports, not for revenue, but for an object\r\ninconsistent with revenue--to promote, by prohibitions, Northern\r\ninterests in the productions of their mines and manufactures.\r\n\r\n\"There is another evil, in the condition of the Southern towards the\r\nNorthern States, which our ancestors refused to bear towards Great\r\nBritain.  Our ancestors not only taxed themselves, but all the taxes\r\ncollected from them were expended amongst them.  Had they submitted to\r\nthe pretensions of the British Government, the taxes collected from\r\nthem, would have been expended in other parts of the British Empire.\r\nThey were fully aware of the effect of such a policy in impoverishing\r\nthe people from whom taxes are collected, and in enriching those who\r\nreceive the benefit of their expenditure.\r\n\r\n\"To prevent the evils of such a policy, was one of the motives which\r\ndrove them on to Revolution, yet this British policy has been fully\r\nrealized towards the Southern States, by the Northern States.  The\r\npeople of the Southern States are not only taxed for the benefit of the\r\nNorthern States, but after the taxes are collected, three fourths of\r\nthem are expended at the North.  This cause, with others, connected with\r\nthe operation of the General Government, has made the cities of the\r\nSouth provincial.  Their growth is paralyzed; they are mere suburbs of\r\nNorthern cities.  The agricultural productions of the South are the\r\nbasis of the foreign commerce of the United States; yet Southern cities\r\ndo not carry it on.  Our foreign trade is almost annihilated.  * * *\r\n\r\n\"No man can for a moment believe, that our ancestors intended to\r\nestablish over their posterity, exactly the same sort of Government they\r\nhad overthrown.  * * *  Yet by gradual and steady encroachments on the\r\npart of the people of the North, and acquiescence on the part of the\r\nSouth, the limitations in the Constitution have been swept away; and the\r\nGovernment of the United States has become consolidated, with a claim of\r\nlimitless powers in its operations.  * * *\r\n\r\n\"A majority in Congress, according to their interested and perverted\r\nviews, is omnipotent.  * * *  Numbers with them, is the great element of\r\nfree Government.  A majority is infallible and omnipotent.  'The right\r\ndivine to rule in Kings,' is only transferred to their majority.  The\r\nvery object of all Constitutions, in free popular Government, is to\r\nrestrain the majority.  Constitutions, therefore, according to their\r\ntheory, must be most unrighteous inventions, restricting liberty.  None\r\nought to exist; but the body politic ought simply to have a political\r\norganization, to bring out and enforce the will of the majority.  This\r\ntheory is a remorseless despotism.  In resisting it, as applicable to\r\nourselves, we are vindicating the great cause of free Government, more\r\nimportant, perhaps, to the World, than the existence of all the United\r\nStates.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his Special Message to the Confederate Congress at Montgomery, April\r\n29, 1861, Mr. Jefferson Davis said:\r\n\r\n\"From a period as early as 1798, there had existed in all the States a\r\nParty, almost uninterruptedly in the majority, based upon the creed that\r\neach State was, in the last resort, the sole judge, as well of its\r\nwrongs as of the mode and measure of redress.  * * *  The Democratic\r\nParty of the United States repeated, in its successful canvas of 1836,\r\nthe declaration, made in numerous previous political contests, that it\r\nwould faithfully abide by and uphold the principles laid down in the\r\nKentucky and Virginia Legislatures of [1798 and] 1799, and that it\r\nadopts those principles as constituting one of the main foundations of\r\nits political creed.\"\r\n\r\nIn a letter addressed by the Rebel Commissioners in London (Yancey, Rost\r\nand Mann), August 14, 1861, to Lord John Russell, Secretary of Foreign\r\nAffairs, it appears that they said: \"It was from no fear that the Slaves\r\nwould be liberated, that Secession took place.  The very Party in power\r\nhas proposed to guarantee Slavery forever in the States, if the South\r\nwould but remain in the Union.\"  On the 4th of May preceding, Lord John\r\nhad received these Commissioners at his house; and in a letter of May\r\n11, 1861, wrote, from the Foreign Office, to Lord Lyons, the British\r\nMinister at Washington, a letter, in which, alluding to his informal\r\ncommunication with them, he said: \"One of these gentlemen, speaking for\r\nthe others, dilated on the causes which had induced the Southern States\r\nto Secede from the Northern.  The principal of these causes, he said,\r\nwas not Slavery, but the very high price which, for the sake of\r\nProtecting the Northern manufacturers, the South were obliged to pay for\r\nthe manufactured goods which they required.  One of the first acts of\r\nthe Southern Congress was to reduce these duties, and to prove their\r\nsincerity he gave as an instance that Louisiana had given up altogether\r\nthat Protection on her sugar which she enjoyed by the legislation of the\r\nUnited States.  As a proof of the riches of the South.  He stated that\r\nof $350,000,000 of exports of produce to foreign countries $270,000,000\r\nwere furnished by the Southern States.\"  * * *  They pointed to the new\r\nTariff of the United States as a proof that British manufactures would\r\nbe nearly excluded from the North, and freely admitted in the South.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis may be as good a place as any other to say a few words touching\r\nanother alleged \"cause\" of Secession.  During the exciting period just\r\nprior to the breaking out of the great War of the Rebellion, the\r\nSlave-holding and Secession-nursing States of the South, made a terrible\r\nhubbub over the Personal Liberty Bills of the Northern States.  And when\r\nSecession came, many people of the North supposed these Bills to be the\r\nprime, if not the only real cause of it.  Not so.  They constituted, as\r\nwe now know, only a part of the mere pretext.  But, none the less, they\r\nconstituted a portion of the history of that eventful time, and cannot\r\nbe altogether ignored.\r\n\r\nIn order then, that the reader may quickly grasp, not only the general\r\nnature, but also the most important details of the Personal Liberty\r\nBills (in force, in 1860, in many of the Free States) so frequently\r\nalluded to in the Debates of Congress, in speeches on the stump, and in\r\nthe fulminations of Seceding States and their authorized agents,\r\ncommissioners, and representatives, it may be well now, briefly to refer\r\nto them, and to state that no such laws existed in California, Illinois,\r\nIndiana, Iowa, Minnesota, New York, Ohio and Oregon.\r\n\r\nThose of Maine provided that no officer of the State should in any way\r\nassist in the arrest or detention of a Fugitive Slave, and made it the\r\nduty of county attorneys to defend the Fugitive Slave against the claim\r\nof his master.  A Bill to repeal these laws passed the Maine Senate, but\r\nfailed in the House.\r\n\r\nThat of Massachusetts provided for commissioners in each county to\r\ndefend alleged Fugitives from Service or Labor; for payment by the\r\nCommonwealth of all expenses of defense; prohibited the issue or service\r\nof process by State officers for arrest of alleged Fugitives, or the use\r\nof any prisons in the State for their detention, or that of any person\r\naiding their escape; prohibited the kidnapping or removal of alleged\r\nFugitive Slaves by any person; prohibited all officers within the State,\r\ndown to Town officers, from arresting, imprisoning, detaining or\r\nreturning to Service \"any Person for the reason that he is claimed or\r\nadjudged to be a Fugitive from Service or Labor\"--all such prohibitions\r\nbeing enforced by heavy fines and imprisonment.  The Act of March 25,\r\n1861, materially modified and softened the above provisions.\r\n\r\nNew Hampshire's law, provided that all Slaves entering the State with\r\nconsent of the master shall be Free, and made the attempt to hold any\r\nperson as a Slave within the State a felony.\r\n\r\nVermont's, prescribed that no process under the Fugitive Slave Law\r\nshould be recognized by any of her Courts, officers, or citizens; nor\r\nany aid given in arresting or removing from the State any Person claimed\r\nas a Fugitive Slave; provided counsel for alleged Fugitives; for the\r\nissue of habeas corpus and trial by jury of issues of fact between the\r\nparties; ordained Freedom to all within the State who may have been held\r\nas Slaves before coming into it, and prescribed heavy penalties for any\r\nattempt to return any such to Slavery.  A bill to repeal these laws,\r\nproposed November, 1860, in the Vermont House of Representatives, was\r\nbeaten by two to one.\r\n\r\nConnecticut's, provided that there must be two witnesses to prove that a\r\nPerson is a Slave; that depositions are not evidence; that false\r\ntestifying in Fugitive Slave cases shall be punishable by fine of $5,000\r\nand five years in State prison.\r\n\r\nIn New Jersey, the only laws touching the subject, permitted persons\r\ntemporarily sojourning in the State to bring and hold their Slaves, and\r\nmade it the duty of all State officers to aid in the recovery of\r\nFugitives from Service.\r\n\r\nIn Pennsylvania, barring an old dead-letter Statute, they simply\r\nprohibited any interference by any of the Courts, Aldermen, or Justices\r\nof the Peace, of the Commonwealth, with the functions of the\r\nCommissioner appointed under the United States Statute in Fugitive Slave\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nIn Michigan, the law required States' attorneys to defend Fugitive\r\nSlaves; prescribed the privileges of habeas corpus and jury trial for\r\nall such arrested; prohibited the use of prisons of the State for their\r\ndetention; required evidence of two credible witnesses as to identity;\r\nand provided heavy penalties of fine and imprisonment for the seizure of\r\nany Free Person, with intent to have such Person held in Slavery.  A\r\nBill to repeal the Michigan law was defeated in the House by about two\r\nto one.\r\n\r\nWisconsin's Personal Liberty law was similar to that of Michigan, but\r\nwith this addition, that no judgment recovered against any person in\r\nthat State for violating the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 should be\r\nenforced by sale or execution of any real or personal property in that\r\nState.\r\n\r\nThat of Rhode Island, forbade the carrying away of any Person by force\r\nout of the State; forbade the official aiding in the arrest or detention\r\nof a Fugitive Slave; and denied her jails to the United States for any\r\nsuch detention.\r\n\r\nApropos of this subject, and before leaving it, it may be well to quote\r\nremarks of Mr. Simons of Rhode Island, in the United States Senate.\r\nSaid he: \"Complaint has been made of Personal Liberty Bills.  Now, the\r\nMassachusetts Personal Liberty Bill was passed by a Democratic House, a\r\nDemocratic Senate, and signed by a Democratic Governor, a man who was\r\nafterwards nominated by Mr. Polk for the very best office in New\r\nEngland, and was unanimously confirmed by a Democratic United States\r\nSenate.  Further than this, the very first time the attention of the\r\nMassachusetts Legislature was called to the propriety of a repeal of\r\nthis law was by a Republican Governor.  Now, on the other hand, South\r\nCarolina had repealed a law imprisoning British colored sailors, but\r\nretained the one imprisoning those coming from States inhabited by her\r\nown brethren!\"\r\n\r\nThese Personal Liberty Bills were undoubtedly largely responsible for\r\nsome of the irritation on the Slavery question preceding open\r\nhostilities between the Sections.  But President Lincoln sounded the\r\nreal depths of the Rebellion when he declared it to be a War upon the\r\nrights of the People.  In his First Annual Message, December 3, 1861, he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"It continues to develop that the insurrection is largely, if not\r\nexclusively, a War upon the first principle of popular government--the\r\nrights of the People.  Conclusive evidence of this is found in the most\r\ngrave and maturely considered public documents, as well as in the\r\ngeneral tone of the insurgents.  In those documents we find the\r\nabridgment of the existing right of suffrage, and the denial to the\r\nPeople of all right to participate in the selection of public officers,\r\nexcept the legislative, boldly advocated, with labored arguments to\r\nprove that large control of the People in government is the source of\r\nall political evil.  Monarchy itself is sometimes hinted at as a\r\npossible refuge from the power of the People.\r\n\r\n\"In my present position, I could scarcely be justified were I to omit\r\nraising a warning voice against this approach of returning despotism.\r\n\r\n\"It is not needed, nor fitting here, that a general argument should be\r\nmade in favor of popular institutions; but there is one point, with its\r\nconnections, not so hackneyed as most others, to which I ask brief\r\nattention.  It is the effort to place Capital on an equal footing with,\r\nif not above Labor, in the structure of the Government.\r\n\r\n\"It is assumed that Labor is available only in connection with Capital;\r\nthat nobody labors unless somebody else, owning Capital, somehow by the\r\nuse of it induces him to labor.  This assumed, it is next considered\r\nwhether it is best that Capital shall hire laborers, and thus induce\r\nthem to work by their own consent, or buy them, and drive them to it\r\nwithout their consent.  Having proceeded so far, it is naturally\r\nconcluded that all laborers are either hired laborers, or what we call\r\nSlaves.  And further, it is assumed that whoever is once a hired laborer\r\nis fixed in that condition for life.\r\n\r\n\"Now, there is no such relation between Capital and Labor as assumed;\r\nnor is there any such thing as a free man being fixed for life, in the\r\ncondition of a hired laborer.  Both these assumptions are false, and all\r\ninferences from them are groundless.\r\n\r\n\"Labor is prior to, and independent of Capital.  Capital is only the\r\nfruit of Labor, and could never have existed if Labor had not first\r\nexisted.  Labor is the superior of Capital, and deserves much the higher\r\nconsideration.  Capital has its rights, which are as worthy of\r\nprotection as any other rights.  Nor is it denied that there is, and\r\nprobably always will be, a relation between Labor and Capital, producing\r\nmutual benefits.  The error is in assuming that the whole Labor of the\r\ncommunity exists within that relation.\r\n\r\n\"A few men own Capital, and that few, avoid labor themselves, and with\r\ntheir Capital hire or buy another few to labor for them.  A large\r\nmajority belong to neither class--neither work for others, nor have\r\nothers working for them.\r\n\r\n\"In most of the Southern States, a majority of the whole people of all\r\ncolors are neither Slaves nor masters; while in the Northern, a large\r\nmajority are neither hirers nor hired.  Men with their families--wives,\r\nsons, and daughters--work for themselves, on their farms, in their\r\nhouses, and in their shops, taking the whole product to themselves, and\r\nasking no favors of Capital on the one hand, nor of hired laborers or\r\nSlaves on the other.\r\n\r\n\"It is not forgotten that a considerable number of persons mingle their\r\nown Labor with Capital--that is they labor with their own hands, and\r\nalso buy or hire others to labor for them; but this is only a mixed, and\r\nnot a distinct class.  No principle stated is disturbed by the existence\r\nof this mixed class.\r\n\r\n\"Again, as has already been said, there is not, of necessity, any such\r\nthing as the free hired-laborer being fixed to that condition for life.\r\nMany independent men everywhere in these States, a few years back in\r\ntheir lives, were hired laborers.\r\n\r\n\"The prudent, penniless beginner in the World, labors for wages awhile,\r\nsaves a surplus with which to buy tools or land for himself, then labors\r\non his own account another while, and at length hires another new\r\nbeginner to help him.  This is the just and generous and prosperous\r\nsystem, which opens the way to all, gives hope to all, and consequent\r\nenergy and progress, and improvement of condition to all.\r\n\r\n\"No men living are more worthy to be trusted than those who toil up from\r\npoverty--none less inclined to take or touch aught which they have not\r\nhonestly earned.  Let them beware of surrendering a political power\r\nwhich they already possess, and which, if surrendered, will surely be\r\nused to close the door of advancement against such as they, and to fix\r\nnew disabilities and burdens upon them, till all of Liberty shall be\r\nlost.  * * *  The struggle of to-day is not altogether for to-day-it is\r\na vast future also.  * * * \"\r\n\r\n\r\nSo too, Andrew Johnson, in his speech before the Senate, January 31,\r\n1862, spake well and truly when he said that \"there has been a\r\ndeliberate design for years to change the nature and character and\r\ngenius of this Government.\"  And he added: \"Do we not know that these\r\nschemers have been deliberately at work, and that there is a Party in\r\nthe South, with some associates in the North, and even in the West, that\r\nhave become tired of Free Government, in which they have lost\r\nconfidence.\"\r\n\r\nSaid he: \"They raise an outcry against 'Coercion,' that they may\r\nparalyze the Government, cripple the exercise of the great powers with\r\nwhich it was invested, finally to change its form and subject us to a\r\nSouthern despotism.  Do we not know it to be so?  Why disguise this\r\ngreat truth?  Do we not know that they have been anxious for a change of\r\nGovernment for years?  Since this Rebellion commenced it has manifested\r\nitself in many quarters.\r\n\r\n\"How long is it since the organ of the Government at Richmond, the\r\nRichmond Whig, declared that rather than live under the Government of\r\nthe United States, they preferred to take the Constitutional Queen of\r\nGreat Britain as their protector; that they would make an alliance with\r\nGreat Britain for the purpose of preventing the enforcement of the Laws\r\nof the United States.  Do we not know this?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nStephen A. Douglas also, in his great Union speech at Chicago, May 1,\r\n1861--only a few days before his lamented death-said:\r\n\r\n\"The election of Mr. Lincoln is a mere pretext.  The present Secession\r\nmovement is the result of an enormous Conspiracy formed more than a year\r\nsince formed by leaders in the Southern Confederacy more than twelve\r\nmonths ago.  They use the Slavery question as a means to aid the\r\naccomplishment of their ends.  They desired the election of a Northern\r\ncandidate by a Sectional vote, in order to show that the two Sections\r\ncannot live together.\r\n\r\n\"When the history of the two years from the Lecompton question down to\r\nthe Presidential election shall be written, it will be shown that the\r\nscheme was deliberately made to break up this Union.\r\n\r\n\"They desired a Northern Republican to be elected by a purely Northern\r\nvote, and then assign this fact as a reason why the Sections cannot live\r\ntogether.  If the Disunion candidate--(Breckinridge) in the late\r\nPresidential contest had carried the united South, their scheme was, the\r\nNorthern candidate successful, to seize the Capital last Spring, and by\r\na united South and divided North, hold it.\r\n\r\n\"Their scheme was defeated, in the defeat of the Disunion candidates in\r\nseveral of the Southern States.\r\n\r\n\"But this is no time for a detail of causes.  The Conspiracy is now\r\nknown; Armies have been raised.  War is levied to accomplish it.  There\r\nare only two sides to the question.\r\n\r\n\"Every man must be for the United States, or against it.  There can be\r\nno Neutrals in this War; only Patriots or Traitors!  [Cheer after\r\nCheer].\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a speech made in the United States Senate, January 31, 1862, Senator\r\nMcDougall of California--conceded to be intellectually the peer of any\r\nman in that Body--said:\r\n\r\n\"We are at War.  How long have we been at War?  We have been engaged in\r\na war of opinion, according to my historical recollection, since 1838.\r\nThere has been a Systematic organized war against the Institutions\r\nestablished by our fathers, since 1832.  This is known of all men who\r\nhave read carefully the history of our Country.  If I had the leisure,\r\nor had consulted the authorities, I would give it year by year, and date\r\nby date, from that time until the present, how men adversary to our\r\nRepublican Institutions have been organizing War against us, because\r\nthey did not approve of our Republican Institutions.\r\n\r\n\"Before the Mexican War, it is well known that General Quitman, then\r\nGovernor of Mississippi, was organizing to produce the same condition of\r\nthings (and he hoped a better condition of things, for he hoped a\r\nsuccessful Secession), to produce this same revolution that is now\r\ndisturbing our whole Land.  The War with Mexico, fighting for a Southern\r\nproposition, for which I fought myself, made the Nation a unit until\r\n1849; and then again they undertook an Organization to produce\r\nRevolution.  These things are history.  This statement is true, and\r\ncannot be denied among intelligent men anywhere, and cannot be denied in\r\nthis Senate.\r\n\r\n\"The great men who sat in Council in this Hall, the great men of the\r\nNation, men whose equals are not, and I fear will not be for many years,\r\nuniting their judgments, settled the controversy in 1850.  They did not\r\nsettle it for the Conspirators of the South, for they were not parties\r\nto the compact.  Clay and Webster, and the great men who united with\r\nthem, had no relation with the extremes of either extreme faction.  The\r\nCompromise was made, and immediately after it had been effected, again\r\ncommenced the work of organization.  I had the honor to come from my\r\nState on the Pacific into the other branch of the Federal Congress, and\r\nthere I learned as early as 1853, that the work of Treason was as\r\nindustriously pursued as it is being pursued to-day.  I saw it; I felt\r\nit; I knew it.  I went home to the shores of the Pacific instructed\r\nsomewhat on this subject.\r\n\r\n\"Years passed by.  I engaged in my duties as a simple professional man,\r\nnot connected with public affairs.  The question of the last\r\nPresidential election arose before the Country--one of those great\r\nquestions that are not appreciated, I regret from my heart, by the\r\nAmerican Nation, when we elect a President, a man who has more power for\r\nhis time than any enthroned Monarch in Europe.  We organize a Government\r\nand place him in front as the head and the Chief of the Government.\r\nThat question came before the American People.\r\n\r\n\"At that time I was advised of this state of feeling--and I will state\r\nit in as exact form of words as I can state it, that it may be\r\nunderstood by Senators: Mr. Douglas is a man acceptable to the South.\r\nMr. Douglas is a man to whom no one has just cause of exception\r\nthroughout the South.  Mr. Douglas is more acceptable to Mississippi and\r\nLouisiana than Mr. Breckinridge.  Mr. Breckinridge is not acceptable to\r\nthe South; or at least, if he is so, he is not in the same degree with\r\nMr. Douglas.  Mr. Douglas is the accepted man of a great National Party,\r\nand if he is brought into the field he will be triumphantly elected.\r\nTHAT MUST NOT BE DONE, because THE ORGANIZATION FOR SECESSION IS\r\nMATURED.  EVERYTHING IS PREPARED, and the election of Mr. Douglas would\r\nonly postpone it for four years; and Now when we are PREPARED to carry\r\nout these things WE MUST INDULGE IN STRATAGEM, and the nomination of Mr.\r\nBreckinridge is a mere strategic movement to divide the great\r\nconservative Party of the Nation into two, so as to elect a Republican\r\ncandidate AND CONSOLIDATE THE SOUTH BY THE CRY OF 'ABOLITIONIST!'\r\n\r\n\"That is a mere simple statement of the truth, and it cannot be\r\ncontradicted.  Now, in that scheme all the men of counsel of that Party\r\nwere engaged.  * * *  I, on the far shores of the Pacific understood\r\nthose things as long ago as a year last September (1860).  I was advised\r\nabout this policy and well informed of it.  * * *\r\n\r\n\"I was at war, in California, in January (1861) last; in the maintenance\r\nof the opinions that I am now maintaining, I had to go armed to protect\r\nmyself from violence.  The country, whenever there was controversy, was\r\nagitated to its deepest foundations.  That is known, perhaps, not to\r\ngentlemen who live up in Maine or Massachusetts, or where you are\r\nforeign to all this agitation; but known to all people where disturbance\r\nmight have been effective in consequences.  I felt it, and had to carry\r\nmy life in my hand by the month, as did my friends surrounding me.\r\n\r\n\"I say that all through last winter (that of 1860-61) War had been\r\ninaugurated in all those parts of the Country where disturbed elements\r\ncould have efficient result.  In January (1861), a year ago, I stood in\r\nthe hall of the House of Representatives of my State, and there was War\r\nthen, and angry faces and hostile men were gathered; and we knew then\r\nwell that the Southern States had determined to withdraw themselves from\r\nthe Federal Union.\r\n\r\n\"I happened to be one of those men who said, 'they shall not do it;' and\r\nit appears to me that the whole argument is between that class of men\r\nand the class of men who said they would let them do it.  * * *  When\r\nthis doctrine was started here of disintegrating the Cotton States from\r\nthe rest of the Confederacy, I opposed it at once.  I saw immediately\r\nthat War was to be invoked.  * * *\r\n\r\n\"I will not say these things were understood by gentlemen of the\r\nRepublican Party * * * but I, having been accepted and received as a\r\nDemocrat of the old school from the olden time, and HAVING FAST SOUTHERN\r\nSYMPATHIES, I DID KNOW ALL ABOUT THEM. * * * I KNOW THAT SECESSION WAS A\r\nTHING DETERMINED UPON.  * * * I was advised of and understood the whole\r\nprogramme, KNEW HOW IT WAS TO BE DONE IN ITS DETAILS; and I being\r\nadvised, made war against it.  * * *\r\n\r\n\"War had been, in fact, inaugurated.  What is War?  Was it the firing on\r\nour flag at Sumter?  Was that the first adversary passage?  To say so,\r\nis trifling with men's judgments and information.  No, sir; when they\r\norganized a Government, and set us at defiance, they commenced War; and\r\nthe various steps they took afterwards, by organizing their troops, and\r\nforming their armies, and advancing upon Sumter; all these were merely\r\nacts of War; but War was inaugurated whenever they undertook to say they\r\nwould maintain themselves as a separate and independent government; and,\r\nafter that time, every man who gave his assistance to them was a\r\nTraitor, according to the highest Law.\"\r\n\r\nThe following letter, written by one of the most active of the Southern\r\nconspirators in 1858, during the great Douglas and Lincoln Debate of\r\nthat year, to which extended reference has already been made, is of\r\ninterest in this connection, not only as corroborative evidence of the\r\nfact that the Rebellion of the Cotton States had been determined on long\r\nbefore Mr. Lincoln was elected President, but as showing also that the\r\nmachinery for \"firing the Southern heart\" and for making a \"solid South\"\r\nwas being perfected even then.  The subsequent split in the Democratic\r\nParty, and nomination of Breckinridge by the Southern wing of it, was\r\nmanaged by this same Yancey, simply as parts of the deliberate programme\r\nof Secession and Rebellion long before determined on by the Cotton Lords\r\nof the Cotton States.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         \"MONTGOMERY, June 15, 1858.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SIR:--Your kind favor of the 13th is received.\r\n\r\n\"I hardly agree with you that a general movement can be made that will\r\nclean out the Augean Stable.  If the Democracy were overthrown it would\r\nresult in giving place to a greedier and hungrier swarm of flies.\r\n\r\n\"The remedy of the South is not in such a process.  It is in a diligent\r\norganization of her true men for prompt resistance to the next\r\naggression.  It must come in the nature of things.  No National Party\r\ncan save us.  No Sectional Party can ever do it.  But if we could do as\r\nour fathers did--organize 'Committees of Safety' all over the Cotton\r\nStates (and it is only in them that we can hope for any effective\r\nmovement), we shall fire the Southern heart, instruct the Southern mind,\r\ngive courage to each other, and at the proper moment, by one organized,\r\nconcerted action, we can precipitate the Cotton States into a\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\n\"The idea has been shadowed forth in the South by Mr. Ruffin; has been\r\ntaken up and recommended in the Advertiser under the name of 'League of\r\nUnited Southerners,' who, keeping up their old relations on all other\r\nquestions, will hold the Southern issues paramount, and influence\r\nparties, legislatures and statesmen.  I have no time to enlarge, but to\r\nsuggest merely.\r\n\r\n\"In haste, yours, etc.\r\n                         \"W. L. YANCEY.\r\n\r\n\"To JAMES S. SLAUGHTER.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Jackson, Mississippi, in the fall of the same year (1858) just after\r\nthe great Debate between Douglas and Lincoln had closed, Jefferson Davis\r\nhad already raised the standard of Revolution, Secession and Disunion,\r\nduring the course of a speech, in which he said: \"If an Abolitionist be\r\nchosen President of the United States, you will have presented to you\r\nthe question of whether you will permit the Government to pass into the\r\nhands of your avowed and implacable enemies?  Without pausing for an\r\nanswer, I will state my own position to be, that such a result would be\r\na species of revolution by which the purposes of the Government would be\r\ndestroyed, and the observance of its mere forms entitled to no respect.\r\nIn that event, in such a manner as should be most expedient, I should\r\ndeem it your duty to provide for your safety, outside of the Union with\r\nthose who have already shown the will, and would have acquired the power\r\nto deprive you of your birthright, and to reduce you to worse than the\r\nColonial dependence of your fathers.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"birthright\" thus referred to was of course, the alleged right to\r\nhave Slaves; but what was this \"worse than Colonial dependence\" to\r\nwhich, in addition to the peril supposed to threaten the Southern\r\n\"birthright,\" the Cotton States of Mississippi were reduced?\r\n\"Dependence\" upon whom, and with regard to what?  Plainly upon the\r\nNorth; and with regard, not to Slavery alone--for Jefferson Davis held,\r\ndown to the very close of the War, that the South fought \"not for\r\nSlavery\"--but as to Tariff Legislation also.  There was the rub! These\r\nCotton Lords believed, or pretended to believe, that the High Tariff\r\nLegislation, advocated and insisted upon both by the Whigs and\r\nRepublicans for the Protection of the American Manufacturer and working\r\nman, built up and made prosperous the North, and elevated Northern\r\nlaborers; at the expense of the South, and especially themselves, the\r\nCotton Lords aforesaid.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen from the utterances of leading men in the South\r\nCarolina, Secession Convention, \"that\"--as Governor Hicks, himself a\r\nSouthern man, said in his address to the people of Maryland, after\r\nthe War broke out \"neither the election of Mr. Lincoln, nor the\r\nnon-execution of the Fugitive Slave Law, nor both combined, constitute\r\ntheir grievances.  They declare that THE REAL CAUSE of their discontent\r\nDATES AS FAR BACK AS 1833.\"\r\n\r\nAnd what was the chief cause or pretext for discontent at that time?\r\nNothing less than the Tariff.  They wanted Free Trade, as well as\r\nSlavery.  The balance of the Union wanted Protection, as well as\r\nFreedom.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent War, then, was not a War waged for Slavery alone, but for\r\nIndependence with a view to Free Trade, as set forth in the \"Confederate\r\nConstitution,\" as soon as that Independence could be achieved.  And the\r\nWar on our part, while for the integrity of the Union in all its parts\r\n--for the life of the Nation itself, and for the freedom of man, should\r\nalso have brought the triumph of the American idea of a Protective\r\nTariff, whose chief object is the building up of American manufactures\r\nand the Protection of the Free working-man, in the essential matters of\r\neducation, food, clothing, rents, wages, and work.\r\n\r\nIt is mentioned in McPherson's History of the Rebellion, p. 392, that in\r\na letter making public his reasons for going to Washington and taking\r\nhis seat in Congress, Mr. James L. Pugh, a Representative from Alabama,\r\nNovember 24, 1860, said: \"The sole object of my visit is to promote the\r\ncause of Secession.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the manner in which they acted after reaching Washington, it is not\r\nunreasonable to suppose that most of those persons representing, in both\r\nbranches of Congress, the Southern States which afterwards seceded, came\r\nto the National Capital with a similar object in view--taking their\r\nsalaries and mileages for services supposed to be performed for the\r\nbenefit of the very Government they were conspiring to injure, and\r\nswearing anew the sacred oath to support and defend the very\r\nConstitution which they were moving heaven and earth to undermine and\r\ndestroy!\r\n\r\n     [As a part of the history of those times, the following letter is\r\n     not without interest:\r\n\r\n     \"OXFORD, December 24, 1860.\r\n\r\n     \"MY DEAR SIR:--I regretted having to leave Washington without\r\n     having with you a full conference as to the great events whose\r\n     shadows are upon us.

The\r\n     friends of Southern Independence, of firm and bona fide resistance,\r\n     won an overwhelming victory; but I doubt whether there is any\r\n     precise plan.\r\n\r\n     \"No doubt a large majority of the Convention will be for separate\r\n     Secession.

Our friends in Pontotoc, Tippah,\r\n     De Soto and Pauola took grounds which fell far short of that idea,\r\n     though their resolutions were very firm in regard to Disunion and\r\n     an ultimate result.\r\n\r\n     \"In the meantime the Disunion sentiment among the people is growing\r\n     every day more intense.\r\n\r\n     \"Upon the whole, you have great cause for gratification in the\r\n     action of your State.\r\n\r\n     \"The submissionists are routed, horse, foot, and dragoons, and any\r\n     concession by the North will fail to restore that sacred attachment\r\n     to the Union which was once so deeply radicated in the hearts of\r\n     our people.  What they want now, is wise and sober leading.  I\r\n     think that there might be more of dignity and prudent foresight in\r\n     the action of our State than have marked the proceedings of South\r\n     Carolina.

It was a secret\r\nconference, but the programme resolved on, soon leaked out.\r\n\r\nThe following, which appeared in the Washington National Intelligencer\r\non Friday, January 11, 1861, tells the story of this stage of the Great\r\nConspiracy pretty clearly:\r\n\r\n\"The subjoined communication, disclosing the designs of those who have\r\nundertaken to lead the movement now threatening a permanent dissolution\r\nof the Union, comes to us from a distinguished citizen of the South\r\n[understood to be Honorable Lemuel D. Evans, Representative from Texas\r\nin the 34th Congress, from March 4, 1855, to March 3, 1857] who formerly\r\nrepresented his State with great distinction in the popular branch of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\n\"Temporarily sojourning in this city he has become authentically\r\ninformed of the facts recited in the subjoined letter, which he\r\ncommunicates to us under a sense of duty, and for the accuracy of which\r\nhe makes himself responsible.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing but assurances coming from such an intelligent, reliable source\r\ncould induce us to accept the authenticity of these startling\r\nstatements, which so deeply concern not only the welfare but the honor\r\nof the Southern people.\r\n\r\n\"To them we submit, without present comment, the programme to which they\r\nare expected to yield their implicit adhesion, without any scruples of\r\nconscience as without any regard for their own safety.\r\n\r\n                    \"'WASHINGTON, January 9, 1861.\r\n\r\n\"'I charge that on last Saturday night (January 5th), a Caucus was held\r\nin this city by the Southern Secession Senators from Florida, Georgia,\r\nAlabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas and Texas.  It was then and\r\nthere resolved in effect to assume to themselves the political power of\r\nthe South, and, to control all political and military operations for the\r\npresent, they telegraphed to complete the plan of seizing forts,\r\narsenals, and custom-houses, and advised the Conventions now in session,\r\nand soon to assemble, to pass Ordinances for immediate Secession; but,\r\nin order to thwart any operations of the Government here, the\r\nConventions of the Seceding States are to retain their representations\r\nin the Senate and the House.\r\n\r\n\"'They also advised, ordered, or directed the assembling of a Convention\r\nof delegates from the Seceding States at Montgomery on the 13th of\r\nFebruary.  This can of course only be done by the revolutionary\r\nConventions usurping the powers of the people, and sending delegates\r\nover whom they will lose all control in the establishment of a\r\nProvisional Government, which is the plan of the dictators.\r\n\r\n\"'This Caucus also resolved to take the most effectual means to dragoon\r\nthe Legislatures of Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, Arkansas, Texas, and\r\nVirginia into following the Seceding States.  Maryland is also to be\r\ninfluenced by such appeals to popular passion as have led to the\r\nrevolutionary steps which promise a conflict with the State and Federal\r\nGovernments in Texas.\r\n\r\n\"'They have possessed themselves of all the avenues of information in\r\nthe South--the telegraph, the press, and the general control of the\r\npostmasters.  They also confidently rely upon defections in the army and\r\nnavy.\r\n\r\n\"'The spectacle here presented is startling to contemplate.  Senators\r\nentrusted with the representative sovereignty of the States, and sworn\r\nto support the Constitution of the United States, while yet acting as\r\nthe privy councillors of the President, and anxiously looked to by their\r\nconstituents to effect some practical plan of adjustment, deliberately\r\nconceive a Conspiracy for the overthrow of the Government through the\r\nmilitary organizations, the dangerous secret order, the 'Knights of the\r\nGolden Circle,' 'Committees of Safety,' Southern leagues, and other\r\nagencies at their command; they have instituted as thorough a military\r\nand civil despotism as ever cursed a maddened Country.\r\n\r\n\"'It is not difficult to foresee the form of government which a\r\nConvention thus hurriedly thrown together at Montgomery will irrevocably\r\nfasten upon a deluded and unsuspecting people.  It must essentially be\r\n'a Monarchy founded upon military principles,' or it cannot endure.\r\nThose who usurp power never fail to forge strong chains.\r\n\r\n\"'It may be too late to sound the alarm.  Nothing may be able to arrest\r\nthe action of revolutionary tribunals whose decrees are principally in\r\n'secret sessions.'  But I call upon the people to pause and reflect\r\nbefore they are forced to surrender every principle of liberty, or to\r\nfight those who are becoming their masters rather than their servants.\r\n                                   \"' EATON\"\r\n\r\n\"As confirming the intelligence furnished by our informant we may cite\r\nthe following extract from the Washington correspondence of yesterday's\r\nBaltimore Sun:\r\n\r\n\"'The leaders of the Southern movement are consulting as to the best\r\nmode of consolidating their interests into a Confederacy under a\r\nProvisional Government.  The plan is to make Senator Hunter, of\r\nVirginia, Provisional President, and Jefferson Davis Commander-in-Chief\r\nof the army of defense.  Mr. Hunter possesses in a more eminent degree\r\nthe philosophical characteristics of Jefferson than any other statesman\r\nnow living.  Colonel Davis is a graduate of West Point, was\r\ndistinguished for gallantry at Buena Vista, and served as Secretary of\r\nWar under President Pierce, and is not second to General Scott in\r\nmilitary science or courage.'\r\n\r\n\"As further confirmatory of the above, the following telegraphic\r\ndispatch in the Charleston Mercury of January 7, 1861, is given:\r\n\r\n\"'[From our Own Correspondent.]\r\n\r\n\"'WASHINGTON, January 6.--The Senators from those of the Southern States\r\nwhich have called Conventions of their people, met in caucus last night,\r\nand adopted the following resolutions:\r\n\r\n\"'Resolved, That we recommend to our respective States immediate\r\nSecession.\r\n\r\n\"'Resolved, That we recommend the holding of a General Convention of the\r\nsaid States, to be holden in the city of Montgomery, Alabama, at some\r\nperiod not later than the 15th day of February, 1861.'\r\n\r\n\"These resolutions were telegraphed this evening to the Conventions of\r\nAlabama, Mississippi, and Florida.  A third resolution is also known to\r\nhave been adopted, but it is of a confidential character, not to be\r\ndivulged at present.  There was a good deal of discussion in the caucus\r\non the question of whether the Seceding States ought to continue their\r\ndelegations in Congress till the 4th of March, to prevent unfriendly\r\nlegislation, or whether the Representatives of the Seceding States\r\nshould all resign together, and leave a clear field for the opposition\r\nto pass such bills, looking to Coercion, as they may see fit.  It is\r\nbelieved that the opinion that they should remain prevailed.\"\r\n\r\nFurthermore, upon the capture of Fernandina, Florida, in 1862, the\r\nfollowing letter was found and published.  Senator Yulee, the writer,\r\nwas present and participated as one of the Florida Senators, in the\r\ntraitorous \"Consultation\" therein referred to--and hence its especial\r\nvalue:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"WASHINGTON, January 7, 1861.\r\n\r\n\"My DEAR SIR:--On the other side is a copy of resolutions adopted at a\r\nconsultation of the Senators from the Seceding States--in which Georgia,\r\nAlabama, Louisiana, Arkansas, Texas, Mississippi, and Florida were\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n\"The idea of the meeting was that the States should go out at once, and\r\nprovide for the early organization of a Confederate Government, not\r\nlater than 15th February.  This time is allowed to enable Louisiana and\r\nTexas to participate.  It seemed to be the opinion that if we left here,\r\nforce, loan, and volunteer Bills might be passed, which would put Mr.\r\nLincoln in immediate condition for hostilities; whereas, by remaining in\r\nour places until the 4th of March, it is thought we can keep the hands\r\nof Mr. Buchanan tied, and disable the Republicans from effecting any\r\nlegislation which will strengthen the hands of the incoming\r\nAdministration.\r\n\r\n\"The resolutions will be sent by the delegation to the President of the\r\nConvention.

Now, the\r\npresent letter is a report by Mr. Yulee, who was present at this\r\n'consultation' as he calls it, of the resolutions adopted on this\r\noccasion, transmitted to the said Finegan, who by the way, was a member\r\nof the 'Sovereign Convention' of Florida, then sitting in the town of\r\nTallahassee.\r\n\r\n\"It will thus be seen that this remarkable letter, which breathes\r\nthroughout the spirit of the Conspirator, in reality lets us into one of\r\nthe most important of the numerous Secret Conclaves which the Plotters\r\nof Treason then held in the Capital.  It was then, as it appears, that\r\nthey determined to strike the blow and precipitate their States into\r\nSecession.  But at the same time they resolved that it would be\r\nimprudent for them openly to withdraw, as in that case Congress might\r\npass 'force, loan, and volunteer bills,' which would put Mr. Lincoln in\r\nimmediate condition for hostilities.  No, no!  that would not do.  (So\r\nmuch patriotic virtue they half suspected, half feared, was left in the\r\nCountry.)  On the contrary, 'by remaining in our places until the 4th of\r\nMarch it is thought we can keep the hands of Mr. Buchanan tied, and\r\ndisable the Republicans from effecting any legislation which will\r\nstrengthen the hands of the incoming Administration.'  Ah what a tragic\r\nback-ground, full of things unutterable, is there!\r\n\r\n\"It appears, however, that events were faster than they, and instead of\r\nbeing able to retain their seats up to the 4th of March, they were able\r\nto remain but a very few weeks.  Mr. Davis withdrew on the 21st of\r\nJanuary, just a fortnight after this 'consultation.'  But for the rest,\r\nmark how faithfully the programme here drawn up by this knot of Traitors\r\nin secret session was realized.  Each of the named States represented by\r\nthis Cabal did, 'as soon as may be, Secede from the Union'--the\r\nMississippi Convention passing its Ordinance on the heels of the receipt\r\nof these resolutions, on the 9th of January; Florida and Alabama on the\r\n11th; Louisiana on the 26th, and Texas on the 1st of February; while the\r\n'organization of the Confederate Government' took place at the very time\r\nappointed, Davis being inaugurated on the 18th of February.\r\n\r\n\"And here is another Plot of the Traitors brought to light.  These very\r\nmen, on withdrawing from the Senate, urged that they were doing so in\r\nobedience to the command of their respective States.  As Mr. Davis put\r\nit, in his parting speech, 'the Ordinance of Secession having passed the\r\nConvention of his State, he felt obliged to obey the summons, and retire\r\nfrom all official connection with the Federal Government.'  This letter\r\nof Mr. Yulee's clearly reveals that they had themselves pushed their\r\nState Conventions to the adoption of the very measure which they had the\r\nhardihood to put forward as an imperious 'summons' which they could not\r\ndisobey.  It is thus that Treason did its Work.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n                  COPPERHEADISM  VS. UNION DEMOCRACY.\r\n\r\nWhen we remember that it was on the night of the 5th of January, 1861,\r\nthat the Rebel Conspirators in the United States Senate met and plotted\r\ntheir confederated Treason, as shown in the Yulee letter, given in the\r\npreceding Chapter of this work, and that on the very next day, January\r\n6, 1861, Fernando Wood, then Mayor of the great city of New York, sent\r\nin to the Common Council of that metropolis, his recommendation that New\r\nYork city should Secede from its own State, as well as the United\r\nStates, and become \"a Free City,\" which, said he, \"may shed the only\r\nlight and hope of a future reconstruction of our once blessed\r\nConfederacy,\" it is impossible to resist the conviction that this\r\nextraordinary movement of his, was inspired and prompted, if not\r\nabsolutely directed, by the secret Rebel Conclave at Washington.  It\r\nbears within itself internal evidences of such prompting.\r\n\r\nThus, when Mayor Wood states the case in the following words, he seems\r\nto be almost quoting word for word an instruction received by him from\r\nthese Rebel leaders--in connection with their plausible argument,\r\nupholding it.  Says he:\r\n\r\n\"Much, no doubt, can be said in favor of the justice and policy of a\r\nseparation.  It may be said that Secession or revolution in any of the\r\nUnited States would be subversive of all Federal authority, and, so far\r\nas the central Government is concerned, the resolving of the community\r\ninto its original elements--that, if part of the States form new\r\ncombinations and, Governments, other States may do the same.  Then it\r\nmay be said, why should not New York city, instead of supporting by her\r\ncontributions in revenue two-thirds of the expenses of the United\r\nStates, become also equally independent?  As a Free City, with but\r\nnominal duty on imports, her local Government could be supported without\r\ntaxation upon her people.  Thus we could live free from taxes, and have\r\ncheap goods nearly duty free.  In this she would have the whole and\r\nunited support of the Southern States, as well as all the other States\r\nto whose interests and rights under the Constitution she has always been\r\ntrue.\"\r\n\r\nThat is the persuasive casuistry peculiar to the minds of the Southern\r\nSecession leaders.  It is naturally followed by a touch of that\r\nself-confident bluster, also at that time peculiar to Southern lips\r\n--as follows:\r\n\r\n\"It is well for individuals or communities to look every danger square\r\nin the face, and to meet it calmly and bravely.  As dreadful as the\r\nsevering of the bonds that have hitherto united the States has been in\r\ncontemplation, it is now apparently a stern and inevitable fact.  We\r\nhave now to meet it, with all the consequences, whatever they may be.\r\nIf the Confederacy is broken up the Government is dissolved, and it\r\nbehooves every distinct community, as well as every individual, to take\r\ncare of themselves.\r\n\r\n\"When Disunion has become a fixed and certain fact, why may not New York\r\ndisrupt the bands which bind her to a venal and corrupt master--to a\r\npeople and a Party that have plundered her revenues, attempted to ruin\r\nher commerce, taken away the power of self-government, and destroyed the\r\nConfederacy of which she was the proud Empire City? * * *\"\r\n\r\nAfter thus restating, as it were, the views and \"arguments\" of the Rebel\r\nJunta, as we may presume them to have been pressed on him, he becomes\r\nsuddenly startled at the Conclave's idea of meeting \"all the\r\nconsequences, whatever they may be,\" and, turning completely around,\r\nwith blanching pen, concludes:\r\n\r\n\"But I am not prepared to recommend the violence implied in these views.\r\nIn stating this argument in favor of freedom, 'peaceably if we can,\r\nforcibly if we must,' let me not be misunderstood.  The redress can be\r\nfound only in appeals to the magnanimity of the people of the whole\r\nState.\" * * *\r\n\r\nIf \"these views\" were his own, and not those of the Rebel Conclave, he\r\nwould either have been \"prepared to recommend the violence implied in\r\nthem,\" or else he would have suppressed them altogether.  But his\r\nutterance is that of one who has certain views for the first time placed\r\nbefore him, and shrinks from the consequences of their advocacy--shrinks\r\nfrom \"the violence implied\" in them--although for some reason he dares\r\nnot refuse to place those views before the people.\r\n\r\nAnd, in carrying out his promise to do so--\"In stating this argument,\"\r\npresumably of the Rebel Conclave, \"in favor of freedom, 'peaceably if we\r\ncan, forcibly if we must'\"--the language used is an admission that the\r\nargument is not his own.  Were it his own, would he not have said in\r\n\"making\" it, instead of in \"stating\" it?  Furthermore, had he been\r\n\"making\" it of his own accord, he would hardly have involved himself in\r\nsuch singular contradictions and explanations as are here apparent.  He\r\nwas plainly \"stating\" the Rebel Conclave's argument, not making one\r\nhimself.  He was obeying orders, under the protest of his fears.  And\r\nthose fears forced his trembling pen to write the saving-clause which\r\n\"qualifies\" the Conclave's second-hand bluster preceding it.\r\n\r\nThat the Rebels hoped for Northern assistance in case of Secession, is\r\nvery clear from many speeches made prior to and soon after the election\r\nof Mr. Lincoln to the Presidency--and from other sources of information.\r\nThus we find in a speech made by Representative L. M. Keitt, of South\r\nCarolina, in Charleston, November, 1860, the following language,\r\nreported by the Mercury:\r\n\r\n\"But we have been threatened.  Mr. Amos Kendall wrote a letter, in which\r\nhe said to Colonel Orr, that if the State went out, three hundred\r\nthousand volunteers were ready to march against her.  I know little\r\nabout Kendall--and the less the better.  He was under General Jackson;\r\nbut for him the Federal treasury seemed to have a magnetic attraction.\r\n\r\n\"Jackson was a pure man, but he had too many around him who made\r\nfortunes far transcending their salaries.  [Applause.]  And this Amos\r\nKendall had the same good fortune under Van Buren.  He (Kendall)\r\nthreatened us on the one side, and John Hickman on the other.  John\r\nHickman said, defiantly, that if we went out of the Union, eighteen\r\nmillions of Northern men would bring us back.\r\n\r\n\"Let me tell you, there are a million of Democrats in the North who,\r\nwhen the Black Republicans attempt to march upon the South, will be\r\nfound a wall of fire in the front.  [Cries of 'that's so,' and\r\napplause.]\"\r\n\r\nHarper's Weekly of May 28, 1864, commenting on certain letters of M. F.\r\nMaury and others, then just come to light, said:\r\n\r\n\"How far Maury and his fellow-conspirators were justified in their hopes\r\nof seducing New Jersey into the Rebellion, may be gathered from the\r\ncorrespondence that took place, in the spring of 1861, between\r\nEx-Governor Price, of New Jersey, who was one of the representatives from\r\nthat State in the Peace Congress, and L. W. Burnet, Esq., of Newark.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Price, in answering the question what ought New Jersey to do, says:\r\n'I believe the Southern confederation permanent.  The proceeding has\r\nbeen taken with forethought and deliberation--it is no hurried impulse,\r\nbut an irrevocable act, based upon the sacred, as was supposed, equality\r\nof the States; and in my opinion every Slave State will in a short\r\nperiod of time be found united in one Confederacy.  * * *  Before that\r\nevent happens, we cannot act, however much we may suffer in our material\r\ninterests.  It is in that contingency, then, that I answer the second\r\npart of your question:--What position for New Jersey will best accord\r\nwith her interests, honor, and the patriotic instincts of her people?  I\r\nsay emphatically she would go with the South from every wise,\r\nprudential, and patriotic reason.'\r\n\r\n\"Ex-Governor Price proceeds to say that he is confident the States of\r\nPennsylvania and New York will 'choose also to cast their lot with the\r\nSouth, and after them, the Western and Northwestern States.'\"\r\n\r\nThe following resolution,* was adopted with others, by a meeting of\r\nDemocrats held January 16, 1861, at National Hall, Philadelphia, and has\r\nbeen supposed to disclose \"a plan, of which ex-Governor Price was likely\r\naware:\"\r\n\r\n\"Twelfth--That in the deliberate judgment of the Democracy of\r\nPhiladelphia, and, so far as we know it, of Pennsylvania, the\r\ndissolution of the Union by the separation of the whole South, a result\r\nwe shall most sincerely lament, may release this Commonwealth to a large\r\nextent from the bonds which now connect her with the Confederacy, except\r\nso far as for temporary convenience she chooses to submit to them, and\r\nwould authorize and require her citizens, through a Convention, to be\r\nassembled for that purpose, to determine with whom her lot should be\r\ncast, whether with the North and the East, whose fanaticism has\r\nprecipitated this misery upon us, or with our brethren of the South,\r\nwhose wrongs we feel as our own; or whether Pennsylvania should stand by\r\nherself, as a distinct community, ready when occasion offers, to bind\r\ntogether the broken Union, and resume her place of loyalty and\r\ndevotion.\"\r\n\r\nSenator Lane of Oregon, replying to Senator Johnson of Tennessee,\r\nDecember 19, 1860, in the United States Senate, and speaking of and for\r\nthe Northern Democracy, said:\r\n\r\n\"They will not march with him under his bloody banner, or Mr. Lincoln's,\r\nto invade the soil of the gallant State of South Carolina, when she may\r\nwithdraw from a Confederacy that has refused her that equality to which\r\nshe is entitled, as a member of the Union, under the Constitution.  On\r\nthe contrary, when he or any other gentleman raises that banner and\r\nattempts to subjugate that gallant people, instead of marching with him,\r\nwe will meet him there, ready to repel him and his forces.  He shall not\r\nbring with him the Northern Democracy to strike down a people contending\r\nfor rights that have been refused them in a Union that ought to\r\nrecognize the equality of every member of the Confederacy.  * * *  I now\r\nserve notice that, when War is made upon that gallant South for\r\nwithdrawing from a Union which refuses them their rights, the Northern\r\nDemocracy will not join in the crusade.  THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WILL HAVE\r\nWAR ENOUGH AT HOME.  THE DEMOCRACY OF THE NORTH NEED NOT CROSS THE\r\nBORDER TO FIND AN ENEMY.\"\r\n\r\nThe following letter from Ex-President Pierce is in the same misleading\r\nstrain:\r\n\r\n\"CLARENDON HOTEL, January 6, 1860.--[This letter was captured, at Jeff.\r\nDavis's house in Mississippi, by the Union troops.]\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR FRIEND:--I wrote you an unsatisfactory note a day or two since.\r\nI have just had a pleasant interview with Mr. Shepley, whose courage and\r\nfidelity are equal to his learning and talents.  He says he would rather\r\nfight the battle with you as the standard-bearer in 1860, than under the\r\nauspices of any other leader.  The feeling and judgment of Mr. S. in\r\nthis relation is, I am confident, rapidly gaining ground in New England.\r\nOur people are looking for 'the coming man,' one who is raised by all\r\nthe elements of his character above the atmosphere ordinarily breathed\r\nby politicians, a man really fitted for this exigency by his ability,\r\ncourage, broad statesmanship, and patriotism.  Colonel Seymour (Thomas\r\nH.) arrived here this morning, and expressed his views in this relation\r\nin almost the identical language used by Mr. Shepley.\r\n\r\n\"It is true that, in the present state of things at Washington and\r\nthroughout the country, no man can predict what changes two or three\r\nmonths may bring forth.  Let me suggest that, in the running debates in\r\nCongress, full justice seems to me not to have been done to the\r\nDemocracy of the North.  I do not believe that our friends at the South\r\nhave any just idea of the state of feeling, hurrying at this moment to\r\nthe pitch of intense exasperation, between those who respect their\r\npolitical obligations and those who have apparently no impelling power\r\nbut that which fanatical passion on the subject of Domestic Slavery\r\nimparts.\r\n\r\n\"Without discussing the question of right, of abstract power to Secede,\r\nI have never believed that actual disruption of the Union can occur\r\nwithout blood; and if, through the madness of Northern Abolitionism,\r\nthat dire calamity must come, THE FIGHTING WILL NOT BE ALONG MASON'S AND\r\nDIXON'S LINE MERELY.  IT [WILL] BE WITHIN OUR OWN BORDERS, IN OUR OWN\r\nSTREETS, BETWEEN THE TWO CLASSES OF CITIZENS TO WHOM I HAVE REFERRED.\r\nThose who defy law and scout Constitutional obligations will, if we ever\r\nreach the arbitrament of arms, FIND OCCUPATION ENOUGH AT HOME.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing but the state of Mrs. Pierce's health would induce me to leave\r\nthe Country now, although it is quite likely that my presence at home\r\nwould be of little service.\r\n\r\n\"I have tried to impress upon our people, especially in New Hampshire\r\nand Connecticut, where the only elections are to take place during the\r\ncoming spring, that while our Union meetings are all in the right\r\ndirection, and well enough for the present, they will not be worth the\r\npaper upon which their resolutions are written unless we can overthrow\r\npolitical Abolitionism at the polls and repeal the Unconstitutional and\r\nobnoxious laws which, in the cause of 'personal liberty,' have been\r\nplaced upon our statute-books.  I shall look with deep interest, and not\r\nwithout hope, for a decided change in this relation.\r\n\r\n                    \"Ever and truly your friend,\r\n                                        \"FRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n\"Hon. JEFF. DAVIS,\r\n\"Washington, D. C.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBut let us turn from contemplating the encouragements to Southern\r\nTreason and Rebellion, held out by Northern Democratic Copperheads, to\r\nthe more pleasing spectacle of Loyalty and Patriotism exhibited by the\r\nDouglas wing of Democracy.\r\n\r\nImmediately after Sumter, and while the President was formulating his\r\nMessage, calling for 75,000 volunteers, Douglas called upon him at the\r\nWhite House, regretted that Mr. Lincoln did not propose to call for\r\nthrice as many; and on the 18th of April, having again visited the White\r\nHouse, wrote, and gave the following dispatch to the Associated Press,\r\nfor circulation throughout the Country:\r\n\r\n\"April 18, 1861, Senator Douglas called on the President, and had an\r\ninteresting conversation on the present condition of the Country.  The\r\nsubstance of it was, on the part of Mr. Douglas, that while he was\r\nunalterably opposed to the administration in all its political issues,\r\nhe was prepared to fully sustain the President in the exercise of all\r\nhis Constitutional functions, to preserve the Union, maintain the\r\nGovernment, and defend the Federal Capital.  A firm policy and prompt\r\naction was necessary.  The Capital was in danger and must be defended at\r\nall hazards, and at any expense of men and money.  He spoke of the\r\npresent and future without any reference to the past.\"\r\n\r\nIt is stated of this meeting and its immediate results: \"The President\r\nwas deeply gratified by the interview.  To the West, Douglas\r\ntelegraphed, 'I am for my Country and against all its assailants.'  The\r\nfire of his patriotism spread to the masses of the North, and Democrat\r\nand Republican rallied to the support of the flag.  In Illinois the\r\nDemocratic and Republican presses vied with each other in the utterance\r\nof patriotic sentiments.  * * *  Large and numerously attended Mass\r\nmeetings met, as it were with one accord, irrespective of parties, and\r\nthe people of all shades of political opinions buried their party\r\nhatchets.  Glowing and eloquent orators exhorted the people to ignore\r\npolitical differences in the present crisis, join in the common cause,\r\nand rally to the flag of the Union and the Constitution.  It was a noble\r\ntruce.  From the many resolutions of that great outpouring of patriotic\r\nsentiment, which ignored all previous party ties, we subjoin the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n\"'Resolved, that it is the duty of all patriotic citizens of Illinois,\r\nwithout distinction of party or sect, to sustain the Government through\r\nthe peril which now threatens the existence of the Union; and of our\r\nLegislature to grant such aid of men and money as the exigency of the\r\nhour and the patriotism of our people shall demand.'\r\n\r\n\"Governor Yates promptly issued his proclamation, dated the 15th of\r\nApril, convening the Legislature for the 23rd inst. in Extraordinary\r\nSession.\r\n\r\n                     *  *  *  *  *  *  *\r\n\r\n\"On the evening of the 25th of April, Mr. Douglas, who had arrived at\r\nthe Capital the day before, addressed the General Assembly and a densely\r\npacked audience, in the Hall of Representatives, in that masterly\r\neffort, which must live and be enshrined in the hearts of his countrymen\r\nso long as our Government shall endure.  Douglas had ever delighted in\r\nthe mental conflicts of Party strife; but now, when his Country was\r\nassailed by the red hand of Treason, he was instantly divested of his\r\nParty armor and stood forth panoplied only in the pure garb of a true\r\nPatriot.\r\n\r\n\"He taught his auditory--he taught his Country, for his speeches were\r\ntelegraphed all over it--the duty of patriotism at that perilous hour of\r\nthe Nation's Life.  He implored both Democrats and Republicans to lay\r\naside their Party creeds and Platforms; to dispense with Party\r\nOrganizations and Party Appeals; to forget that they were ever divided\r\nuntil they had first rescued the Government from its assailants.  His\r\narguments were clear, convincing, and unanswerable; his appeals for the\r\nSalvation of his Country, irresistible.  It was the last speech, but\r\none, he ever made.\"\r\n\r\nAmong other pithy and patriotic points made by him in that great speech\r\n--[July 9, 1861.]--were these: \"So long as there was a hope of a\r\npeaceful solution, I prayed and implored for Compromise.  I have spared\r\nno effort for a peaceful solution of these troubles; I have failed, and\r\nthere is but one thing to do--to rally under the flag.\"   \"The South has\r\nno cause of complaint.\"  \"Shall we obey the laws or adopt the Mexican\r\nsystem of War, on every election.\"  \"Forget Party--all remember only\r\nyour Country.\"  \"The shortest road to Peace is the most tremendous\r\npreparation for War.\"  \"It is with a sad heart and with a grief I have\r\nnever before experienced, that I have to contemplate this fearful\r\nStruggle.  * * *  But it is our duty to protect the Government and the\r\nflag from every assailant, be he who he may.\"\r\n\r\nIn Chicago, Douglas repeated his patriotic appeal for the preservation\r\nof the Union, and tersely declared that \"There can be no Neutrals in\r\nthis War--only Patriots and Traitors.\"  In that city he was taken with a\r\nmortal illness, and expired at the Tremont House, June 3, 1861--just one\r\nmonth prior to the meeting of the called Session of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe wonderful influence wielded by Douglas throughout the North, was\r\nwell described afterward by his colleague, Judge Trumbull, in the\r\nSenate, when he said: \"His course had much to do in producing that\r\nunanimity in support of the Government which is now seen throughout the\r\nLoyal States.  The sublime spectacle of twenty million people rising as\r\none man in vindication of Constitutional Liberty and Free Government,\r\nwhen assailed by misguided Rebels and plotting Traitors, is, to a\r\nconsiderable extent due to his efforts.  His magnanimous and patriotic\r\ncourse in this trying hour of his Country's destiny was the crowning act\r\nof his life.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Senator McDougall of California--his life-long friend--in describing\r\nthe shock of the first intelligence that reached him, of his friend's\r\nsudden death, with words of even greater power, continued: \"But, as,\r\npowerless for the moment to resist the tide of emotions, I bowed my head\r\nin silent grief, it came to me that the Senator had lived to witness the\r\nopening of the present unholy War upon our Government; that, witnessing\r\nit, from the Capital of his State, as his highest and best position, he\r\nhad sent forth a War-cry worthy of that Douglass, who, as ancient\r\nlegends tell, with the welcome of the knightly Andalusian King, was\r\ntold,\r\n\r\n               '\"Take thou the leading of the van,\r\n               And charge the Moors amain;\r\n               There is not such a lance as thine\r\n               In all the hosts of Spain.'\r\n\r\n\"Those trumpet notes, with a continuous swell, are sounding still\r\nthroughout all the borders of our Land.  I heard them upon the mountains\r\nand in the valleys of the far State whence I come.  They have\r\ncommunicated faith and strength to millions.  * * *  I ceased to grieve\r\nfor Douglas.  The last voice of the dead Douglas I felt to be stronger\r\nthan the voice of multitudes of living men.\"\r\n\r\nAnd here it may not be considered out of place for a brief reference to\r\nthe writer's own position at this time; especially as it has been much\r\nmisapprehended and misstated.  One of the fairest of these statements*\r\nruns thus:\r\n\r\n     [Lusk's History of the Politics of Illinois from 1856 to 1884, p.\r\n     175.]\r\n\r\n\"It is said that Logan did not approve the great speech made by Senator\r\nDouglas, at Springfield, in April, 1861, wherein he took the bold ground\r\nthat in the contest which was then clearly imminent to him, between the\r\nNorth and the South, that there could be but two parties, Patriots and\r\nTraitors.  But granting that there was a difference between Douglas and\r\nLogan at that time, it did not relate to their adhesion to the Cause of\r\ntheir Country Logan had fought for the Union upon the plains of Mexico,\r\nand again stood ready to give his life, if need be, for his Country,\r\neven amid the cowardly slanders that were then following his pathway.\r\n\r\n\"The difference between Douglas and Logan was this: Mr. Douglas was\r\nfresh from an extended campaign in the dissatisfied Sections of the\r\nSouthern States, and he was fully apprised of their intention to attempt\r\nthe overthrow of the Union, and was therefore in favor of the most\r\nstupendous preparations for War.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Logan, on the other hand, believed in exhausting all peaceable\r\nmeans before a resort to Arms, and in this he was like President\r\nLincoln; but when he saw there was no alternative but to fight, he was\r\nready and willing for armed resistance, and, resigning his seat in\r\nCongress, entered the Army, as Colonel of the Thirty-first Illinois\r\nInfantry, and remained in the field in active service until Peace was\r\ndeclared.\"\r\n\r\nThis statement is, in the main, both fair and correct.\r\n\r\nIt is no more correct, however, in intimating that \"Logan did not\r\napprove the great speech made by Senator Douglas, at Springfield, in\r\nApril, 1861, wherein he took the bold ground that in the contest which\r\nwas then clearly imminent to him, between the North and the South, that\r\nthere could be but two parties, Patriots and Traitors,\" than others have\r\nbeen in intimating that he was disloyal to the Union, prior to the\r\nbreaking out of hostilities--a charge which was laid out flat in the\r\nSenate Chamber, April 19, 1881.\r\n\r\n     [In Dawson's Life of Logan, pp. 348-353, this matter is thus\r\n     alluded to:\r\n\r\n     \"In an early part of this work the base charge that Logan was not\r\n     loyal before the War has been briefly touched on.  It may be well\r\n     here to touch on it more fully.  As was then remarked, the only man\r\n     that ever dared insinuate to Logan's face that he was a Secession\r\n     sympathizer before the War, was Senator Ben Hill of Georgia, in the\r\n     United States Senate Chamber, March 30, 1881; and Logan instantly\r\n     retorted: 'Any man who insinuates that I sympathized with it at\r\n     that time insinuates what is false,' and Senator Hill at once\r\n     retracted the insinuation.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Subsequently, April 19, 1881, Senator Logan, in a speech,\r\n     fortified with indisputable record and documentary evidence,\r\n     forever set at rest the atrocious calumny.  From that record it\r\n     appears that on the 17th December, 1860, while still a Douglas\r\n     Democrat, immediately after Lincoln's election, and long before his\r\n     inauguration, and before even the first gun of the war was fired,\r\n     Mr. Logan, then a Representative in the House, voted affirmatively\r\n     on a resolution, offered by Morris of Illinois, which declared an\r\n     'immovable attachment' to 'our National Union,' and 'that it is our\r\n     patriotic duty to stand by it as our hope in peace and our defense\r\n     in war;' that on the 7th January, 1861, Mr. Adrian having offered\r\n     the following 'Resolved, That we fully approve of the bold and\r\n     patriotic act of Major Anderson in withdrawing from Fort Moultrie\r\n     to Fort Sumter, and of the determination of the President to\r\n     maintain that fearless officer in his present position; and that we\r\n     will support the President in all constitutional measures to\r\n     enforce the laws and preserve the Union'--Mr. Logan, in casting his\r\n     vote, said: 'As the resolution receives my unqualified approval, I\r\n     vote Aye;' and that further on the 5th of February, 1861, before\r\n     the inauguration of President Lincoln, in a speech made by Logan in\r\n     the House in favor of the Crittenden Compromise measures, he used\r\n     the following language touching Secession:\r\n\r\n     \"'Sir, I have always denied, and do yet deny, the right of\r\n     Secession.  There is no warrant for it in the Constitution.  It is\r\n     wrong, it is unlawful, unconstitutional, and should be called by\r\n     the right name--revolution.  No good, sir, can result from it, but\r\n     much mischief may.  It is no remedy for any grievances.  I hold\r\n     that all grievances can be much easier redressed inside the Union\r\n     than out of it.'\r\n\r\n     \"In that same speech he also * * * said:\r\n\r\n     \"'I have been taught that the preservation of this glorious Union,\r\n     with its broad flag waving over us as the shield for our protection\r\n     on land and on sea, is paramount to all the parties and platforms\r\n     that ever have existed or ever can exist.  I would, to day, if I\r\n     had the power, sink my own party and every other one, with all\r\n     their platforms, into the vortex of ruin, without heaving a sigh or\r\n     shedding a tear, to save the Union, or even stop the revolution\r\n     where it is.'\r\n\r\n     \"In this most complete speech of vindication--which Senator Logan\r\n     said he put upon record, 'First, that my children, after me, may\r\n     not have these slanders thrown in their faces without the power of\r\n     dispelling or refuting them; and second, that they may endure in\r\n     this Senate Chamber, so that it may be a notice to Senators of all\r\n     parties and all creeds that hereafter, while I am here in the\r\n     Senate, no insinuation of that kind will be submitted to by me,'\r\n     --the proofs of the falsity of the charge were piled mountain-high,\r\n     and among them the following voluntary statements from two\r\n     Democratic Senators, who were with him before the War, in the House\r\n     of Representatives:\r\n\r\n                    \"'United States Senate Chamber,\r\n                         WASHINGTON, April 14, 1881.\r\n\r\n     \"'DEAR SIR: In a discussion in the Senate a few weeks since you\r\n     referred to the fact that a Southern Senator, who had served with\r\n     you in Congress before the War, could testify that during your term\r\n     of service there you gave no encouragement to the Secession of the\r\n     Southern States, adding, however, that you did not ask such\r\n     testimony.  I was not sure at the time that your reference was to\r\n     me, as Senator Pugh of Alabama, was also a member of that Congress.\r\n\r\n     \"'Since then, having learned that your reference was to me, I\r\n     propose on the floor of the Senate, should suitable occasion offer,\r\n     to state what I know of your position and views at the time\r\n     referred to.

I am now\r\n     satisfied they did.  I have heard the Senator's statement with\r\n     great interest, and I take pleasure in saying--for I had some idea\r\n     before that there was some shadow of truth in this report--that I\r\n     think his vindication' is full, complete, and conclusive.'\r\n\r\n     \"'I recollect very well during the war, when I was Governor of my\r\n     State and the Federal army was invading it, to have had a large\r\n     force of militia aiding the Confederate army, and that Gen. Logan\r\n     was considered by us as one of the ablest, most gallant, and\r\n     skillful leaders of the Federal army.  We had occasion to feel his\r\n     power, and we learned to respect him.'\r\n\r\n     \"Senator Beck, of Kentucky (Democrat), referring to the fact that\r\n     he was kept out of the House at one time, and a great many\r\n     suggestions had been made to him as to General Logan, continued:\r\n\r\n     \"'As I said the other day, I never proposed to go into such things,\r\n     and never have done so; but at that time General Frank Blair was\r\n     here, and I submitted many of the papers I received to him,--I\r\n     never thought of using any of them,--and I remember the remark that\r\n     he made to me: Beck, John Logan was one of the hardest fighters of\r\n     the war; and when many men who were seeking to whistle him down the\r\n     wind because of his politics when the war began, were snugly fixed\r\n     in safe places, he was taking his life in his hand wherever the\r\n     danger was greatest--and I tore up every paper I got, and burnt it\r\n     in the fire before his eyes.'\r\n\r\n     \"Senator Dawes of Massachusetts (Republican), also took occasion to\r\n     say:\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. President, I do not know that anything which can be said on\r\n     this side would be of any consequence to the Senator from Illinois\r\n     in this matter.  But I came into the House of Representatives at\r\n     the same session that the Senator did.\r\n\r\n     \"'He was at that time one of the most intense of Democrats, and I\r\n     was there with him when the Rebellion first took root and\r\n     manifested itself in open and flagrant war; and I wish to say as a\r\n     Republican of that day, when the Senator from Illinois was a\r\n     Democrat, that at the earliest possible moment when the Republican\r\n     Party was in anxiety as to the position of the Northern Democracy\r\n     on the question of forcible assault on the Union, nothing did they\r\n     hail with more delight than the early stand which the Senator from\r\n     Illinois, from the Democratic side of the House, took upon the\r\n     question of resistance to the Government of the United States.\r\n\r\n     \"I feel that it is right that I should state that he was among the\r\n     first, if not the very first, of the Northern Democrats who came\r\n     out openly and declared, whatever may have been their opinion about\r\n     the doctrines of the Republican Party, that when it came to a\r\n     question of forcible resistance, they should be counted on the side\r\n     of the Government, and in co-operation with the Republican Party in\r\n     the attempt to maintain its authority.'\r\n\r\n     \"'I am very glad, whether it be of any service or not, to bear this\r\n     testimony to the early stand the Senator from Illinois took while\r\n     he was still a Democrat, and the large influence he exerted upon\r\n     the Northern Democracy, which kept it from being involved in the\r\n     condition and in the work of the Southern Democracy at that\r\n     time.'\"]\r\n\r\nSo far from this being the case, the fact is--and it is here mentioned\r\nin part to bring out the interesting point that, had he lived, Douglas\r\nwould have been no idle spectator of the great War that was about to be\r\nwaged--that when Douglas visited Springfield, Illinois, to make that\r\ngreat speech in the latter part of April, 1861, the writer went there\r\nalso, to see and talk over with him the grave situation of affairs, not\r\nonly in the Nation generally, but particularly in Illinois.  And on that\r\noccasion Mr. Douglas said to him, substantially: \"The time has now\r\narrived when a man must be either for or against his Country.  Indeed so\r\nstrongly do I feel this, and that further dalliance with this question\r\nis useless, that I shall myself take steps to join the Array, and fight\r\nfor the maintenance of the Union.\"\r\n\r\nTo this the writer replied that he was \"equally well convinced that each\r\nand every man must take his stand,\" and that he also \"purposed at an\r\nearly day to raise a Regiment and draw the sword in that Union's\r\ndefense.\"\r\n\r\nThis was after Sumter, and only seventy days before Congress was to meet\r\nin Called Session.  When that session met, Douglas had, weeks before,\r\ngone down to the grave amid the tears of a distracted Nation, with the\r\nsolemn injunction upon his dying lips: \"Obey the Laws and Defend the\r\nConstitution\"--and the writer had returned to Washington, to take his\r\nseat in Congress, with that determination still alive in his heart.\r\n\r\nIn fact there had been all along, substantial accord between Mr. Douglas\r\nand the writer.  There really was no \"difference between Douglas and\r\nLogan\" as to \"preparations for War,\" or in \"exhausting all Peaceable\r\nmeans before a resort to Arms,\" and both were in full accord with\r\nPresident Lincoln on these points.\r\n\r\nLet us see if this is not of record: Take the writer's speech in the\r\nHouse of Representatives, February 5, 1861, and it will be seen that he\r\nsaid: \"I will go as far as any man in the performance of a\r\nConstitutional duty to put down Rebellion, to suppress Insurrection, and\r\nto enforce the Laws.\"  Again, he said, \"If all the evils and calamities\r\nthat have ever happened since the World began, could be gathered in one\r\nGreat Catastrophe, its horrors could not eclipse, in their frightful\r\nproportions, the Drama that impends over us.\"\r\n\r\nFrom these extracts it is plain enough that even at this very early day\r\nthe writer fully understood the \"frightful proportions\" of the impending\r\nstruggle, and would \"go as far as\"--not only Mr. Douglas, but--\"any man,\r\nto put down Rebellion\"--which necessarily involved War, and\r\n\"preparations for War.\"  But none the less, but rather the more, because\r\nof the horrors which he foresaw must be inseparable from so terrible a\r\nWar, was he anxious by timely mutual Concessions--\"by any sacrifice,\" as\r\nhe termed it--if possible, to avert it.\r\n\r\nHe was ready to sink Party, self, and to accept any of the Propositions\r\nto that end--Mr. Douglas's among them.\r\n\r\n     [See his speech of February 5, 1861, Congressional Globe]\r\n\r\nIn this attitude also he was in accord with Mr. Douglas, who, as well as\r\nthe writer, was ready to make any sacrifice, of Party or self; to\r\n\"exhaust every effort at peaceful adjustment,\" before resorting to War.\r\nThe fact is they were much of the time in consultation, and always in\r\nsubstantial accord.\r\n\r\nIn a speech made in the Senate, March 15, 1861, Mr. Douglas had reduced\r\nthe situation to the following three alternative points:\r\n\r\n\"1. THE RESTORATION AND PRESERVATION OF THE UNION by such Amendments to\r\nthe Constitution as will insure the domestic tranquillity, safety, and\r\nequality of all the States, and thus restore peace, unity, and\r\nfraternity, to the whole Country.\r\n\r\n\"2. A PEACEFUL DISSOLUTION OF THE UNION by recognizing the Independence\r\nof such States as refuse to remain in the Union without such\r\nConstitutional Amendments, and the establishment of a liberal system of\r\ncommercial and social intercourse with them by treaties of commerce and\r\namity.\r\n\r\n\"3. WAR, with a view to the subjugation and military occupation of those\r\nStates which have Seceded or may Secede from the Union.\"\r\n\r\nAs a thorough Union man, he could never have agreed to a \"Peaceful\r\nDissolution of the Union.\"  On the other hand he was equally averse to\r\nWar, because he held that \"War is Disunion.  War is final, eternal\r\nSeparation.\"  Hence, all his energies and talents were given to carrying\r\nout his first-stated line of policy, and to persuading the Seceders to\r\naccept what in that line was offered to them by the dominant party.\r\n\r\nHis speech in the Senate, March 25, 1861, was a remarkable effort in\r\nthat respect.  Mr. Breckinridge had previously spoken, and had declared\r\nthat: \"Whatever settlement may be made of other questions, this must be\r\nsettled upon terms that will give them [the Southern States] either a\r\nright, in common with others, to emigrate into all the territory, or\r\nwill secure to them their rights on a principle of equitable division.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Douglas replied: \"Now, under the laws as they stand, in every\r\nTerritory of the United States, without any exception, a Southern man\r\ncan go with his Slave-property on equal terms with all other property.\r\n* * *  Every man, either from the North or South, may go into the\r\nTerritories with his property on terms of exact equality, subject to the\r\nlocal law; and Slave-property stands on an equal footing with all other\r\nkinds of property in the Territories of the United States.  It now\r\nstands on an equal footing in all the Territories for the first time.\r\n\r\n\"I have shown you that, up to 1859, little more than a year ago, it was\r\nprohibited in part of the Territories.  It is not prohibited anywhere\r\nnow.  For the first time, under Republican rule, the Southern States\r\nhave secured that equality of rights in the Territories for their\r\nSlave-property which they have been demanding so long.\"\r\n\r\nHe held that the doctrine of Congressional prohibition in all the\r\nTerritories, as incorporated in the Wilmot proviso, had now been\r\nrepudiated by the Republicans of both Houses of Congress, who had \"all\r\ncome over to Non-intervention and Popular Sovereignty;\" that the \"Wilmot\r\nproviso is given up; that Congressional prohibition is given up; that\r\nthe aggressive policy is repudiated; and hereafter the Southern man and\r\nthe Northern man may move into the Territories with their Property on\r\nterms of entire equality, without excepting Slaves or any other kind of\r\nproperty.\"\r\n\r\nContinuing, he said: \"What more do the Southern States want?  What more\r\ncan any man demand?  Non-intervention is all you asked.  Will it be said\r\nthe South required in addition to this, laws of Congress to protect\r\nSlavery in the Territories?  That cannot be said; for only last May, the\r\nSenate, by a nearly unanimous vote--a unanimous vote of the Southern\r\nmen, with one or two exceptions--declared that affirmative legislation\r\nwas not needed at this time.  * * * What cause is there for further\r\nalarm in the Southern States, so far as the Territories are concerned?\r\n* * *\r\n\r\n\"I repeat, the South has got all they ever claimed in all the\r\nTerritories.  * * *  Then, sir, according to law, the Slaveholding\r\nStates have got equality in the Territories.  How is it in fact.  * * *\r\nNow, I propose to show that they have got the actual equitable\r\npartition, giving them more than they were disposed to demand.\r\n\r\n\"The Senator from Kentucky, * * *  Mr. Crittenden, introduced a\r\nproposition for an equitable partition.  That proposition was, that\r\nnorth of 36  30' Slavery should be prohibited, and South of it should be\r\nprotected, by Territorial law.  * * *  What is now the case?  It is true\r\nthe Crittenden proposition has not yet become part of the Constitution;\r\nbut it is also true that an equitable partition has been made by the\r\nvote of the people themselves, establishing, maintaining, and protecting\r\nSlavery in every inch of territory South of the thirty-seventh parallel,\r\ngiving the South half a degree more than the Crittenden Proposition.\r\n\r\n\"There stands your Slave-code in New Mexico protecting Slavery up to the\r\nthirty-seventh degree as effectually as laws can be made to protect it.\r\nThere it stands the Law of the Land.  Therefore the South has all below\r\nthe thirty-seventh parallel, while Congress has not prohibited Slavery\r\neven North of it.\r\n\r\n                    *  *  *  *  *  *\r\n\r\n\"What more, then, is demanded?  Simply that a Constitutional Amendment\r\nshall be adopted, affirming--what?  Precisely what every Republican in\r\nboth Houses of Congress has voted for within a month.  Just do, by\r\nConstitutional Amendment, what you have voted in the Senate and House of\r\nRepresentatives, that is all.  You are not even required to do that, but\r\nmerely to vote for a proposition submitting the question to the People\r\nof the States whether they will make a Constitutional Amendment\r\naffirming the equitable partition of the Territories which the People\r\nhave already made.  * * *\r\n\r\n\"You may ask, why does the South want us to do it by Constitutional\r\nAmendment, when we have just done it voluntarily by Law?  The President\r\nof the United States, in his Inaugural, has told you the reason.  He has\r\ninformed you that all of these troubles grow out of the absence of a\r\nConstitutional provision defining the power of Congress over the subject\r\nof Slavery.  * * *  He thinks that the trouble has arisen from the\r\nabsence of such a Constitutional Provision, and suggests a National\r\nConvention to enable the People to supply the defect, leaving the People\r\nto say what it is, instead of dictating to them what it shall be.\"\r\n\r\nIt may here be remarked that while Mr. Douglas held that \"So far as the\r\ndoctrine of Popular Sovereignty and Nonintervention is concerned, the\r\nColorado Bill, the Nevada Bill, and the Dakota Bill, are identically the\r\nsame with the Kansas-Nebraska Bill, and in its precise language\"--these\r\nformer Bills having been passed at the last Session of the 36th\r\nCongress--the Republicans, on the contrary, held that neither in these\r\nnor other measures had they abandoned any distinctive Republican\r\nprinciple; while Breckinridge declared that they had passed those\r\nTerritorial Bills, without the Wilmot proviso, because they felt\r\nperfectly secure in those Territories, with all the Federal patronage in\r\nRepublican hands.\r\n\r\nHowever that may be, we have here, brought out in strong contrast, the\r\nconciliatory feeling which inspired such Union men as Douglas, and the\r\nstrong and persistent efforts they made in behalf of Concession and\r\nPeace up to a period only a few weeks before the bombardment of Sumter;\r\nand the almost total revulsion in their sentiments after that event, as\r\nto the only proper means to preserve the Union.  For it was only then\r\nthat the truth, as it fell from Douglas's lips at Springfield, was fully\r\nrecognized, to wit: that there was no half-way ground betwixt Patriotism\r\nand Treason; that War was an existing fact; and that Patriots must arm\r\nto defend and preserve the Union against the armed Traitors assailing\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAt last, July 4, 1861, the Congress met, and proceeded at once with\r\ncommendable alacrity and patriotism, to the consideration and enactment\r\nof measures sufficient to meet the extraordinary exigency, whether as\r\nregards the raising and equipment of the vast bodies of Union volunteers\r\nneeded to put down Rebellion, or in the raising of those enormous\r\namounts of money which the Government was now, or might thereafter be,\r\ncalled upon to spend like water in preserving the Union.\r\n\r\nIt was at this memorable Session, of little over one month, that the\r\nchief of the great \"War Measures\" as they were termed, were enacted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n                          THE STORM OF BATTLE\r\n\r\nWe have seen how Fort Sumter fell; how the patriotic North responded to\r\nPresident Lincoln's Call, for 75,000 three-months volunteers, with such\r\nenthusiasm that, had there been a sufficiency of arms and accoutrements,\r\nhe might have had, within three months of that Call, an Army of 500,000\r\nmen in the field; how he had called for 42,000 three-years volunteers\r\nearly in May, besides swelling what little there was of a regular Army\r\nby ten full regiments; and how a strict blockade of the entire Southern\r\nCoast-line had not only been declared, but was now enforced and\r\nrespected.\r\n\r\nGeneral Butler, promoted Major-General for his Military successes at\r\nAnnapolis and Baltimore, was now in command of Fortress Monroe and\r\nvicinity, with some 12,000 volunteers under him, confronted, on the\r\nPeninsula, by a nearly equal number of Rebel troops, under Generals\r\nHuger and Magruder--General Banks, with less than 10,000 Union troops,\r\noccupying Baltimore, and its vicinage.\r\n\r\nGeneral Patterson, with some 20,000 Union troops--mostly Pennsylvania\r\nmilitia--was at Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, with about an equal number\r\nof the Enemy, under General Joseph E. Johnston, at Harper's Ferry, on\r\nthe Potomac, watching him.\r\n\r\nSome 50,000 Union troops were in camp, in and about Washington, on the\r\nVirginia side, under the immediate command of Generals McDowell and\r\nMansfield--Lieutenant General Scott, at Washington, being in\r\nChief-command of the Union Armies--and, confronting these Union forces,\r\nin Virginia, near the National Capital, were some 30,000 Rebel troops\r\nunder the command of General Beauregard, whose success in securing the\r\nevacuation of Fort Sumter by its little garrison of half-starved Union\r\nsoldiers, had magnified him, in the eyes of the rebellious South, into\r\nthe proportions of a Military genius of the first order.\r\n\r\nThere had been no fighting, nor movements, worthy of special note, until\r\nJune 7th, when General Patterson advanced from Chambersburg,\r\nPennsylvania, to Hagerstown, Maryland.  General Johnston at once\r\nevacuated Harper's Ferry, and retreated upon Winchester, Virginia.\r\n\r\nGeneral McClellan, in command of the Department of the Ohio, had,\r\nhowever, crossed the Ohio river, and by the 4th of July, being at\r\nGrafton, West Virginia, with his small Army of Union troops, to which a\r\ngreatly inferior Rebel force was opposed, commenced that successful\r\nadvance against it, which led, after Bull Run, to his being placed at\r\nthe head of all the Armies of the United States.\r\n\r\nSubsequently Patterson crossed the Potomac, and after trifling away over\r\none month's time, at last, on the 15th of July, got within nine miles of\r\nWinchester and Johnston's Army.  Barring a spiritless reconnaissance,\r\nPatterson--who was a fervent Breckinridge-Democrat in politics, and\r\nwhose Military judgment, as we shall see, was greatly influenced, if not\r\nentirely controlled, by his Chief of staff, Fitz John Porter--never got\r\nany nearer to the Enemy!\r\n\r\nInstead of attacking the Rebel force, under Johnston, or at least\r\nkeeping it \"employed,\" as he was ordered to do by General Scott; instead\r\nof getting nearer, and attempting to get between Winchester and the\r\nShenandoah River, as was suggested to him by his second in command,\r\nGeneral Sanford; and instead of permitting Sanford to go ahead, as that\r\nGeneral desired to, with his own 8,000 men, and do it himself; General\r\nPatterson ordered him off to Charlestown--twelve miles to the Union left\r\nand rear,--and then took the balance of his Army, with himself, to the\r\nsame place!\r\n\r\nIn other words, while he had the most positive and definite orders, from\r\nGeneral Scott, if not to attack and whip Johnston, to at least keep him\r\nbusy and prevent that Rebel General from forming a junction, via the\r\nManassas Gap railroad or otherwise, with Beauregard, Patterson\r\ndeliberately moved his Army further away from Winchester and gave to the\r\nEnemy the very chance of escaping and forming that junction which was\r\nessential to Rebel success in the vicinity of Manassas.\r\n\r\nBut for this disobedience of orders, Bull Run would doubtless have been\r\na great victory to the Union Arms, instead of a reverse, and the War,\r\nwhich afterward lasted four years, might have been over in as many\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nIt is foreign to the design of this work, to present in it detailed\r\ndescriptions of the battles waged during the great War of the Rebellion\r\n--it being the present intention of the writer, at some later day, to\r\nprepare and publish another work devoted to such stirring Military\r\nscenes.  Yet, as it might seem strange and unaccountable for him to pass\r\nby, at this time, without any description or comment, the first pitched\r\nbattle of the Rebellion, he is constrained to pause and view that\r\nmemorable contest.  And first, it may be well to say a word of the\r\ngeneral topography of the country about the battle-field.\r\n\r\nThe Alleghany Mountains, or that part of them with which we have now to\r\ndo, stretch in three almost equidistant parallel ridges, from North-East\r\nto South-West, through the heart of Old Virginia.  An occasional pass,\r\nor \"Gap,\" through these ridges, affords communication, by good roads,\r\nbetween the enclosed parallel valleys and the Eastern part of that\r\nState.\r\n\r\nThe Western of these Alleghany ridges bears the name of \"Alleghany\r\nMountains\" proper; the Eastern is called the \"Blue Ridge;\" while the\r\nMiddle Ridge, at its Northern end--which rests upon the Potomac, where\r\nthat river sweeps through three parallel ridges almost at right angles\r\nto their own line of direction--is called the \"Great North Mountain.\"\r\n\r\nThe valley, between the Middle Ridge and the Blue Ridge, is known as the\r\nShenandoah Valley, taking its name from the Shenandoah River, which, for\r\nmore than one hundred miles, flows along the Western foot of the Blue\r\nRidge, toward the North-East, until it empties into the Potomac, at\r\nHarper's Ferry.\r\n\r\nThe Orange and Alexandria railroad runs from Alexandria,--on the\r\nopposite bank of the Potomac from Washington, and a few miles below\r\nthe Capital,--in a general Southeasterly direction, to Culpepper\r\nCourt-House; thence Southerly to Gordonsville, where it joins the\r\nVirginia Central--the Western branch of which runs thence through\r\nCharlotteville, Staunton, and Covington, across the ridges and valleys\r\nof the Alleghanies, while its Eastern branch, taking a general\r\nSouth-easterly direction, crosses the Richmond and Fredricksburg\r\nrailroad at Hanover Junction, some twenty miles North of Richmond,\r\nand thence sweeps Southerly to the Rebel capital.\r\n\r\nIt is along this Easterly branch of the Virginia Central that Rebel\r\nre-enforcements will be hurried to Beauregard, from Richmond to\r\nGordonsville, and thence, by the Orange and Alexandria railroad, to\r\nManassas Junction.\r\n\r\nSome twenty-five miles from Alexandria, a short railroad-feeder--which\r\nruns from Strasburg, in the Shenandoah Valley, through the Blue Ridge,\r\nat Manassas Gap, in an East-South-easterly direction--strikes the\r\nAlexandria and Orange railroad.  The point of contact is Manassas\r\nJunction; and it is along this Manassas-Gap feeder that Johnston, with\r\nhis Army at Winchester--some twenty miles North-North-East of Strasburg\r\n--expects, in case of attack by Patterson, to be re-enforced by\r\nBeauregard; or, in case the latter is assailed, to go to his assistance,\r\nafter shaking off Patterson.\r\n\r\nThis little link of railroad, known as the Manassas Gap railroad, is\r\ntherefore an important factor in the game of War, now commencing in\r\nearnest; and it had, as we shall see, very much to do, not only with the\r\nadvance of McDowell's Union Army upon Bull Run, but also with the result\r\nof the first pitched battle thereabout fought.\r\n\r\nFrom Alexandria, some twelve miles to the Westward, runs a fine turnpike\r\nroad to Fairfax Court-House; thence, continuing Westward, but gradually\r\nand slightly dipping award the South, it passes through Germantown,\r\nCentreville, and Groveton, to Warrenton.\r\n\r\nThis \"Warrenton Pike\"--as it is termed--also plays a somewhat\r\nconspicuous part, before, during, and after the Battle of Bull Run.  For\r\nmost of its length, from Fairfax Court-House to Warrenton, the Warrenton\r\nPike pursues a course almost parallel with the Orange and Alexandria\r\nrailroad aforesaid, while the stream of Bull Run, pursuing a\r\nSouth-easterly course, has a general direction almost parallel with\r\nthat of the Manassas Gap railroad.\r\n\r\nWe shall find that it is the diamond-shaped parallelogram, formed by the\r\nobtuse angle junction of the two railroads on the South, and the\r\nsimilarly obtuse-angled crossing of the stream of Bull Run by the\r\nWarrenton Pike on the North, that is destined to become the historic\r\nbattle-field of the first \"Bull Run,\" or \"Manassas;\" and it is in the\r\nNorthern obtuse-angle of this parallelogram that the main fighting is\r\ndone, upon a spot not much more than one mile square, three sides of the\r\nsame being bounded respectively by the Bull Run stream, the Warrenton\r\nPike, which crosses it on a stone bridge, and the Sudley Springs road,\r\nwhich crosses the Pike, at right-angles to it, near a stone house.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd of June, 1861, General McDowell, in command of the Department\r\nof North-Eastern Virginia, with head-quarters at Arlington, near\r\nWashington, receives from Colonel Townsend, Assistant Adjutant-General\r\nwith Lieutenant-General Scott--who is in Chief command of all the Union\r\nForces, with Headquarters at Washington--a brief but pregnant\r\ncommunication, the body of which runs thus: \"General Scott desires you\r\nto submit an estimate of the number and composition of a column to be\r\npushed toward Manassas Junction, and perhaps the Gap, say in four or\r\nfive days, to favor Patterson's attack on Harper's Ferry.  The rumor is\r\nthat Arlington Heights will be attacked to-night.\"\r\n\r\nIn response to this request, General McDowell submits, on the day\r\nfollowing, an estimate that \"the actual entire force at the head of the\r\ncolumn should, for the purpose of carrying the position at Manassas and\r\nof occupying both the road to Culpepper, and the one to the Gap, be as\r\nmuch as 12,000 Infantry, two batteries of regular Artillery, and from\r\nsix to eight companies of Cavalry, with an available reserve, ready to\r\nmove forward from Alexandria by rail, of 5,000 Infantry and one heavy\r\nfield battery, rifled if possible; these numbers to be increased or\r\ndiminished as events may indicate.\"  This force of raw troops he\r\nproposes to organize into field brigades under the command of \"active\r\nand experienced colonels\" of the regular Army.  And while giving this\r\nestimate as to the number of troops necessary, he suggestively adds that\r\n\"in proportion to the numbers used will be the lives saved; and as we\r\nhave such numbers pressing to be allowed to serve, might it not be well\r\nto overwhelm and conquer as much by the show of force as by the use of\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\nSubsequently McDowell presents to General Scott, and Mr. Lincoln's\r\nCabinet, a project of advance and attack, which is duly approved and\r\nordered to be put in execution.  In that project or plan of operations,\r\nsubmitted by verbal request of General Scott, near the end of June,--the\r\nsuccess of which is made contingent upon Patterson's holding Johnston\r\nengaged at Winchester in the Shenandoah Valley, and also upon Butler's\r\nholding the Rebel force near Fortress Monroe from coming to Beauregard's\r\naid at Manassas Junction,--McDowell estimates Beauregard's strength at\r\n25,000, with a possible increase, bringing it up to 35,000 men.  The\r\nobjective point in McDowell's plan, is Manassas Junction, and he\r\nproposes \"to move against Manassas with a force of 30,000 of all arms,\r\norganized into three columns, with a reserve of 10,000.\"\r\n\r\nMcDowell is fully aware that the Enemy has \"batteries in position at\r\nseveral places in his front, and defensive works on Bull Run, and\r\nManassas Junction.\"  These batteries he proposes to turn.  He believes\r\nBull Run to be \"fordable at almost anyplace,\"--an error which ultimately\r\nrenders his plan abortive,--and his proposition is, after uniting his\r\ncolumns on the Eastern side of Bull Run, \"to attack the main position by\r\nturning it, if possible, so as to cut off communications by rail with\r\nthe South, or threaten to do so sufficiently to force the Enemy to leave\r\nhis intrenchments to guard them.\"\r\n\r\nIn other words, assuming the Enemy driven back, by minor flanking\r\nmovements, or otherwise, upon his intrenched position at Bull Run, or\r\nManassas, the plan is to turn his right, destroy the Orange and\r\nAlexandria railroad leading South, and the bridge at Bristol, so as to\r\ncut off his supplies.  This done, the Enemy--if nothing worse ensues for\r\nhim--will be in a \"bad box.\"\r\n\r\nMcDowell, however, has no idea that the Enemy will stand still to let\r\nthis thing be done.  On the contrary, he is well satisfied that\r\nBeauregard will accept battle on some chosen ground between Manassas\r\nJunction and Washington.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of Tuesday, the 16th of July, the advance of McDowell's\r\nArmy commences.  That Army is organized into five divisions--four of\r\nwhich accompany McDowell, while a fifth is left to protect the defensive\r\nworks of Washington, on the South bank of the Potomac.  This latter, the\r\nFourth Division, commanded by Brigadier-General Theodore Runyon,\r\ncomprises eight unbrigaded New Jersey regiments of (three months, and\r\nthree years) volunteers--none of which take part in the ensuing\r\nconflicts-at-arms.\r\n\r\nThe moving column consists of the First Division, commanded by\r\nBrigadier-General Daniel Tyler, comprising four brigades, respectively\r\nunder Brigadier-General R.  C. Schenck, and Colonels E. D. Keyes, W. T.\r\nSherman, and I. B. Richardson; the Second Division, commanded by Colonel\r\nDavid Hunter, comprising two brigades, under Colonels Andrew Porter and\r\nA. E. Burnside respectively; the Third Division, commanded by Colonel S.\r\nP. Heintzelman, comprising three brigades, under Colonels W. B.\r\nFranklin, O. B. Wilcox, and O. O. Howard, respectively; and the Fifth\r\nDivision, commanded by Colonel Dixon S. Miles, comprising two brigades,\r\nunder Colonels Lewis Blenker, and Thomas A.  Davies, respectively.\r\n\r\nTyler's Division leads the advance, moving along the Leesburg road to\r\nVienna, on our right, with orders to cross sharply to its left, upon\r\nFairfax Court House, the following (Wednesday) morning.  Miles's\r\nDivision follows the turnpike road to Annandale, and then moves, by the\r\nBraddock road,--along which Braddock, a century before, had marched his\r\ndoomed army to disaster,--upon Fairfax Court House, then known to be\r\nheld by Bonham's Rebel Brigade of South Carolinians.  Hunter follows\r\nMiles, to Annandale, and thence advances direct upon Fairfax, by the\r\nturnpike road--McDowell's idea being to bag Bonham's Brigade, if\r\npossible, by a simultaneous attack on the front and both flanks.  But\r\nthe advance is too slow, and the Enemy's outposts, both there and\r\nelsewhere, have ample opportunity of falling safely back upon their main\r\nposition, behind the stream of Bull Run.\r\n\r\n     [McDowell in his testimony before the \"Committee on the Conduct of\r\n     the War,\" said: \"At Fairfax Court House was the South Carolina\r\n     Brigade.  And I do not suppose anything would have had a greater\r\n     cheering effect upon the troops, and perhaps upon the Country, than\r\n     the capture of that brigade.  And if General Tyler could have got\r\n     down there any time in the forenoon instead of in the afternoon,\r\n     the capture of that brigade was beyond question.  It was about\r\n     5,000 or 6,000 men, and Tyler had 12,000, at the same time that we\r\n     were pressing on in front.  He did not get down there until in the\r\n     afternoon; none of us got forward in time.\"]\r\n\r\nThis slowness is due to various causes.  There is a pretty general\r\ndread, for example, among our troops, of threatened ambuscades, and\r\nhence the advance is more cautious than it otherwise would be.  It is\r\nthought the part of wisdom, as it were, to \"feel the way.\"  The\r\nmarching, moreover, is new to our troops.  General Scott had checked\r\nMcDowell when the latter undertook to handle eight regiments together,\r\nnear Washington, by intimating that he was \"trying to make a show.\"\r\nThus the very essential knowledge of how to manoeuvre troops in large\r\nbodies, has been withheld from our Union generals, while the volunteer\r\nregiments have either rusted in camp from inaction, or have been denied\r\nthe opportunity of acquiring that endurance and hardiness and discipline\r\nwhich frequent movement of troops confers.  Hence, all unused to the\r\ndiscipline of the march, every moment some one falls out of line to\r\n\"pick blackberries, or to get water.\"  Says McDowell, in afterward\r\nreporting this march: \"They would not keep in the ranks, order as much\r\nas you pleased.  When they came where water was fresh, they would pour\r\nthe old water out of their canteens and fill them with fresh water; they\r\nwere not used to denying themselves much.\"\r\n\r\nMeantime, Heintzelman's Division is also advancing, by cross-roads, more\r\nto the left and South of the railroad line,--in accordance with\r\nMcDowell's plan, which comprehends not only the bagging of Bonham, but\r\nan immediate subsequent demonstration, by Tyler, upon Centreville and\r\nbeyond, while Heintzelman, supported by Hunter and Miles, shall swoop\r\nacross Bull Run, at Wolf Run Shoals, some distance below Union Mills,\r\nturn the Enemy's right, and cut off his Southern line of railroad\r\ncommunications.  Thus, by the evening of Wednesday, the 17th,\r\nHeintzelman is at Sangster's Station, while Tyler, Miles, and Hunter,\r\nare at Fairfax.\r\n\r\nIt is a rather rough experience that now befalls the Grand Army of the\r\nUnion.  All unused, as we have seen, to the fatigues and other hardships\r\nof the march, the raw levies, of which it almost wholly consists, which\r\nstarted bright and fresh, strong and hopeful, full of the buoyant ardor\r\nof enthusiastic patriotism, on that hot July afternoon, only some thirty\r\nhours back, are now dust-begrimed, footsore, broken down, exhausted by\r\nthe scorching sun, hungry, and without food,--for they have wasted the\r\nrations with which they started, and the supply-trains have not yet\r\narrived.  Thus, hungry and physically prostrated, \"utterly played out,\"\r\nas many of them confess, and demoralized also by straggling and loss of\r\norganization, they bivouac that night in the woods, and dream uneasy\r\ndreams beneath the comfortless stars.\r\n\r\nA mile beyond Fairfax Court House, on the Warrenton Turnpike, is\r\nGermantown.  It is here that Tyler's Division has rested, on the night\r\nof the 17th.  At 7 o'clock on the morning of Thursday, the 18th, in\r\nobedience to written orders from McDowell, it presses forward, on that\r\n\"Pike,\" to Centreville, five miles nearer to the Enemy's position behind\r\nBull Run--Richardson's Brigade in advance--and, at 9 o'clock, occupies\r\nit.  Here McDowell has intended Tyler to remain, in accordance with the\r\nplan, which he has imparted to him in conversation, and in obedience to\r\nthe written instructions to: \"Observe well the roads to Bull Run and to\r\nWarrenton.  Do not bring on an engagement, but keep up the impression\r\nthat we are moving on Manassas,\"--this advance, by way of Centreville,\r\nbeing intended solely as a \"demonstration\" to mask the real movement,\r\nwhich, as we have seen, is to be made by the other divisions across Wolf\r\nRun Shoals, a point on Bull Run, some five or six miles below Union\r\nMills, and some seven miles below Blackburn's Ford.\r\n\r\nUpon the arrival of Richardson's Brigade, Thursday morning, at\r\nCentreville, it is found that, under cover of the darkness of the\r\nprevious night, the Enemy has retreated, in two bodies, upon Bull Run,\r\nthe one along the Warrenton Pike, the other (the largest) down the\r\nridge-road from Centreville to Blackburn's Ford.  Richardson's Brigade\r\nat once turns down the latter road and halts about a mile beyond\r\nCentreville, at a point convenient to some springs of water.  Tyler soon\r\nafterward rides up, and, taking from that brigade two companies of light\r\nInfantry and a squadron of Cavalry, proceeds, with Colonel Richardson,\r\nto reconnoitre the Enemy, finding him in a strong position on the\r\nopposite bank of Bull Run, at Blackburn's Ford.\r\n\r\nWhile this is going on, McDowell has ridden in a Southerly direction\r\ndown to Heintzelman's Division, at Sangster's Station, \"to make\r\narrangements to turn the Enemy's right, and intercept his communications\r\nwith the South,\" but has found, owing to the narrowness and crookedness\r\nof the roads, and the great distance that must be traversed in making\r\nthe necessary detour, that his contemplated movement is too risky to be\r\nventured.  Hence he at once abandons his original plan of turning the\r\nEnemy's right, and determines on \"going around his left, where the\r\ncountry is more open, and the roads broad and good.\"\r\n\r\nMcDowell now orders a concentration, for that night, of the four\r\ndivisions, with two days cooked rations in their haversacks, upon and\r\nabout Centreville,--the movement to commence as soon as they shall\r\nreceive expected commissariat supplies.  But, later on the 18th,\r\n--learning that his advance, under Tyler, has, against orders, become\r\nengaged with the Enemy--he directs the concentration to be made at once.\r\n\r\nLet us examine, for a moment, how this premature engagement comes about.\r\nWe left Tyler, accompanied by Richardson, with a squadron of Cavalry and\r\na battalion of light Infantry making a reconnaissance, on Thursday\r\nmorning the 18th, toward Blackburn's Ford.  They approach within a mile\r\nof the ford, when they discover a Rebel battery on the farther bank of\r\nBull Run--so placed as to enfilade the road descending from their own\r\nposition of observation down to the ford,--strong Rebel infantry pickets\r\nand skirmishing parties being in front.\r\n\r\nTyler at once orders up his two rifled guns, Ayres' Battery, and\r\nRichardson's entire Brigade--and later, Sherman's Brigade as a reserve.\r\nAs soon as they come up,--about noon-he orders the rifled guns into\r\nbattery on the crest of the hill, about one mile from, and looking down\r\nupon, the Rebel battery aforesaid, and opens upon the Enemy; giving him\r\na dozen shells,--one of them making it lively for a body of Rebel\r\nCavalry which appears between the ford and Manassas.\r\n\r\nThe Rebel battery responds with half a dozen shots, and then ceases.\r\nTyler now orders Richardson to advance his brigade and throw out\r\nskirmishers to scour the thick woods which cover the Bull Run\r\nbottom-land.  Richardson at once rapidly deploys the battalion of light\r\nInfantry as skirmishers in advance of his brigade, pushes them forward\r\nto the edge of the woods, drives in the skirmishers of the Enemy in fine\r\nstyle, and supports their further advance into the woods, with the 1st\r\nMassachusetts Regiment.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Tyler, discovering a favorable opening in the woods, \"low down\r\non the bottom of the stream,\" for a couple of howitzers in battery,\r\nsends Captain Ayres of the 5th U. S. Artillery, and a detached section\r\n(two 12-pound howitzers) of his battery, with orders to post it himself\r\non that spot, and sends Brackett's squadron of the 2d Cavalry to his\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nNo sooner does Ayres open fire on the Enemy, than he awakens a Rebel\r\nhornet's-nest.  Volley after volley of musketry shows that the Bull Run\r\nbottom fairly swarms with Rebel troops, while another Rebel battery,\r\nmore to the Rebel right, opens, with that already mentioned, a\r\nconcentrated cross-fire upon him.\r\n\r\nAnd now Richardson orders up the 12th New York, Colonel Walrath, to the\r\nleft of our battery.  Forming it into line-of-battle, Richardson orders\r\nit to charge through the woods upon the Enemy.  Gallantly the regiment\r\nmoves forward, after the skirmishers, into the woods, but, being met by\r\na very heavy fire of musketry and artillery along the whole line of the\r\nEnemy's position, is, for the most part, thrown back in confusion--a\r\nmere fragment* remaining in line, and retreating,--while the howitzers,\r\nand Cavalry also, are withdrawn.\r\n\r\nMeantime, however, Richardson has ordered up, and placed in\r\nline-of-battle, on the right of our battery, the 1st Massachusetts, the\r\n2d Michigan (his own), and the 3d Michigan.  The skirmishers in the\r\nwoods still bravely hold their ground, undercover, and these three\r\nregiments are plucky, and anxious to assault the Enemy.  Richardson\r\nproposes to lead them in a charge upon the Enemy's position, and drive\r\nhim out of it; but Tyler declines to give permission, on the ground that\r\nthis being \"merely a reconnaissance,\" the object of which--ascertaining\r\nthe strength and position of the Enemy--having been attained, a further\r\nattack is unnecessary.  He therefore orders Richardson to \"fall back in\r\ngood order to our batteries on the hill,\"--which he does.\r\n\r\nUpon reaching these batteries, Richardson forms his 2d Michigan, in\r\n\"close column by division,\" on their right, and the 1st Massachusetts\r\nand 3d Michigan, in \"line of battle,\" on their left--the 12th New York\r\nre-forming, under cover of the woods at the rear, later on.  Then, with\r\nour skirmishers thrown into the woods in front, their scattering fire,\r\nand the musketry responses of the Rebels, are drowned in the volume of\r\nsound produced by the deafening contest which ensues between our\r\nArtillery, and that of the Enemy from his batteries behind Bull Run.\r\n\r\nThis artillery-duel continues about one hour; and then seems to cease by\r\nmutual consent, about dusk--after 415 shots have been fired on the Union\r\nside, and have been responded to by an equal number from the Rebel\r\nbatteries, \"gun for gun\"--the total loss in the engagement, on the Union\r\nside, being 83, to a total loss among the Enemy, of Thursday night,\r\nRichardson retires his brigade upon Centreville, in order to secure\r\nrations and water for his hungry and thirsty troops,--as no water has\r\nyet been found in the vicinity of the Union batteries aforesaid.  On the\r\nmorrow, however, when his brigade re-occupies that position, water is\r\nfound in abundance, by digging for it.\r\n\r\nThis premature attack, at Blackburn's Ford, by Tyler, against orders,\r\nhaving failed, throws a wet blanket upon the martial spirit of\r\nMcDowell's Army.  In like degree is the morale of the Rebel Army\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nIt is true that Longstreet, in command of the Rebel troops at\r\nBlackburn's Ford, has not had things all his own way; that some of his\r\nartillery had to be \"withdrawn;\" that, as he acknowledges in his report,\r\nhis brigade of three Virginia regiments (the 1st, 11th, and 17th) had\r\n\"with some difficulty repelled\" the Union assault upon his position;\r\nthat he had to call upon General Early for re-enforcements; that Early\r\nre-enforced him with two Infantry regiments (the 7th Louisiana and 7th\r\nVirginia) at first; that one of these (the 7th Virginia) was \"thrown\r\ninto confusion;\" that Early then brought up his own regiment (the 24th\r\nVirginia) under Lieutenant Colonel Hairston, and the entire seven guns\r\nof the \"Washington Artillery;\" and that but for the active \"personal\r\nexertions\" of Longstreet, in \"encouraging the men under his command,\"\r\nand the great numerical superiority of the Rebels, there might have been\r\nno Union \"repulse\" at all.  Yet still the attack has failed, and that\r\nfailure, while it dispirits the Patriot Army, inspires the Rebel Army\r\nwith renewed courage.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, Friday, the 19th of July, is devoted to\r\nreconnaissances by the Engineer officers of the Union Army; to the\r\ncooking of the supplies, which have at last arrived; and to resting the\r\nweary and road-worn soldiers of the Union.\r\n\r\nLet us take advantage of this halt in the advance of McDowell's \"Grand\r\nArmy of the United States\"--as it was termed--to view the Rebel position\r\nat, and about Manassas, and to note certain other matters having an\r\nimportant and even determining bearing upon the issue of the impending\r\nshock-at-arms.\r\n\r\nBeauregard has received early information of McDowell's advance from\r\nArlington, and of his plans.\r\n\r\n     [This he admits, in his report, when he says; \"Opportunely informed\r\n     of the determination of the Enemy to advance on Manassas, my\r\n     advanced brigades, on the night of the 16th of July, were made\r\n     aware, from these headquarters, of the impending movement,\"]\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday the 16th, he notifies his advanced brigades.  On Wednesday,\r\nhe sends a dispatch from Manassas, to Jefferson Davis, at Richmond,\r\nannouncing that the Union troops have assailed his outposts in heavy\r\nforce; that he has fallen back before them, on the line of Bull Run; and\r\nthat he intends to make a stand at Mitchell's Ford (close to Blackburn's\r\nFord) on that stream,--adding: if his (McDowell's) force is\r\noverwhelming, \"I shall retire to the Rappahannock railroad bridge,\r\nsaving my command for defense there, and future operations.  Please\r\ninform Johnston of this, via Staunton, and also Holmes.  Send forward\r\nany re-enforcements at the earliest possible instant, and by every\r\npossible means.\"\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, however, Beauregard loses no time in advantageously\r\nposting his troops.  On the morning of the 18th of July, when the Union\r\nadvance enters Centreville, he has withdrawn all his advanced brigades\r\nwithin the Rebel lines of Bull Run, resting them on the South side of\r\nthat stream, from Union Mills Ford, near the Orange and Alexandria\r\nrailroad bridge, up to the stone bridge over which the Warrenton Pike\r\ncrosses the Run,--a distance of some six to eight miles.\r\n\r\nBetween the Rebel left, at Stone Bridge, and the Rebel right, at Union\r\nMills Ford, are several fords across Bull Run--the general course of the\r\nstream being from the North-West to South-East, to its confluence with\r\nthe Occoquan River, some twelve miles from the Potomac River.\r\n\r\nMitchell's Ford, the Rebel center, is about three miles to the\r\nSouth-West of, and about the same distance North-East from, Manassas\r\nJunction. But it may be well, right here, to locate all these fordable\r\ncrossings of the rocky, precipitous, and well-wooded Bull Run stream,\r\nbetween the Stone Bridge and Union Mills Ford.  Thus, half a mile below\r\nthe Stone Bridge is Lewis's Ford; half a mile below that, Ball's Ford;\r\nhalf a mile below that, Island Ford; one and one-half miles below that,\r\nMitchell's Ford--one mile below that.\r\n\r\nBlackburn's Ford; three-quarters of a mile farther down, McLean's Ford;\r\nand nearly two miles lower down the stream, Union Mills Ford.\r\n\r\nBy Thursday morning, the 18th of July, Beauregard has advantageously\r\nposted the seven brigades into which he has organized his forces, at\r\nthese various positions along his extended front, as follows:\r\n\r\nAt the Stone Bridge, Brigadier-General N. G. Evans's Seventh Brigade, of\r\none regiment and one battalion of Infantry, two companies of Cavalry,\r\nand a battery of four six-pounders.\r\n\r\nAt Lewis's, Balls, and Island Fords--Colonel P. St. George Cocke's\r\nFifth Brigade, of three regiments of Infantry, one battery of Artillery,\r\nand one company of Cavalry.\r\n\r\nAt Mitchell's Ford, Brigadier-General M. L. Bonham's First Brigade, of\r\nfour Infantry regiments, two batteries, and six companies of Cavalry.\r\n\r\nAt Blackburn's Ford, Brigadier-General J. Longstreet's Fourth Brigade,\r\nof four Infantry regiments, with two 6-pounders.\r\n\r\nAt McLean's Ford, Brigadier-General D. R. Jones's Third Brigade of three\r\nInfantry regiments, one Cavalry company, and two 6-pounders.\r\n\r\nAt Union Mills Ford, Brigadier-General R. S. Ewell's Second Brigade, of\r\nthree Infantry regiments, three Cavalry companies, and four 12-powder\r\nhowitzers--Colonel Jubal A. Early's Sixth Brigade, of three Infantry\r\nregiments and three rifled pieces of Walton's Battery, being posted in\r\nthe rear of, and as a support to, Ewell's Brigade.\r\n\r\n     [Johnston also found, on the 20th, the Reserve Brigade of Brig.\r\n     Gen. T. H. Holmes--comprising two regiments of Infantry, Walker's\r\n     Battery of Artillery, and Scott's Cavalry-with Early's Brigade, \"in\r\n     reserve, in rear of the right.\"]\r\n\r\nThe disposition and strength of Beauregard's forces at these various\r\npoints along his line of defense on Bull Run stream, plainly shows his\r\nexpectation of an attack on his right; but he is evidently suspicious\r\nthat it may come upon his centre; for, as far back as July 8th, he had\r\nissued special orders to the effect that:\r\n\r\n\"Should the Enemy march to the attack of Mitchell's Ford, via\r\nCentreville, the following movements will be made with celerity:\r\n\r\n\"I. The Fourth Brigade will march from Blackburn's Ford to attack him on\r\nthe flank and centre.\r\n\r\n\"II. The Third Brigade will be thrown to the attack of his centre and\r\nrear toward Centreville.\r\n\r\n\"III.  The Second and Sixth Brigades united will also push forward and\r\nattack him in the rear by way of Centreville, protecting their own right\r\nflanks and rear from the direction of Fairfax Station and Court House.\r\n\r\n\"IV.  In the event of the defeat of the Enemy, the troops at Mitchell's\r\nFord and Stone Bridge, especially the Cavalry and Artillery, will join\r\nin the pursuit, which will be conducted with vigor but unceasing\r\nprudence, and continued until he shall have been driven beyond the\r\nPotomac.\"\r\n\r\nAnd it is not without interest to note Beauregard's subsequent\r\nindorsement on the back of these Special Orders, that: \"The plan of\r\nattack prescribed within would have been executed, with modifications\r\naffecting First and Fifth Brigades, to meet the attack upon Blackburn's\r\nFord, but for the expected coming of General Johnston's command, which\r\nwas known to be en route to join me on [Thursday] the 18th of July.\"\r\n\r\nThe knowledge thus possessed on Thursday, the 18th, by Beauregard, that\r\nJohnston's Army is on its way to join him, is of infinite advantage to\r\nthe former.  On the other hand, the complete ignorance, at this time, of\r\nMcDowell on this point,--and the further fact that he has been lulled\r\ninto a feeling of security on the subject, by General Scott's emphatic\r\nassurance to him that \"if Johnston joins Beauregard, he shall have\r\nPatterson on his heels\"--is a great disadvantage to the Union general.\r\n\r\nWere McDowell now aware of the real Military situation, he would\r\nunquestionably make an immediate attack, with the object of crushing\r\nBeauregard before Johnston can effect a junction with him.  It would\r\nthen be a mere matter of detail for the armies of McDowell, McClellan,\r\nand Patterson, to bag Johnston, and bring the armed Rebellion to an\r\ninglorious and speedy end.  But Providence--through the plottings of\r\nindividuals within our own lines--wills it otherwise.\r\n\r\nLong before this, Patterson has been informed by General Winfield Scott\r\nof the proposed movement by McDowell upon Manassas,--and of its date.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, July 13th, General Scott telegraphed to Patterson: \"I\r\ntelegraphed to you yesterday, if not strong enough to beat the Enemy\r\nearly next week, make demonstrations so as to detain him in the Valley\r\nof Winchester; but if he retreats in force toward Manassas, and it be\r\ntoo hazardous to follow him, then consider the route via Keys Ferry,\r\nLeesburg, etc.\"\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, the 17th, Scott telegraphs to Patterson: \"I have nothing\r\nofficial from you since Sunday (14th), but am glad to learn, through\r\nPhiladelphia papers, that you have advanced.  Do not let the Enemy amuse\r\nand delay you with a small force in front whilst he re-enforces the\r\nJunction with his main body.  McDowell's first day's work has driven the\r\nEnemy beyond Fairfax Court House.  The Junction will probably be carried\r\nby to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, the 18th, Patterson replies that to attack \"the greatly\r\nsuperior force at Winchester \"when the three months volunteers' time was\r\nabout up, and they were threatening to leave him--would be \"most\r\nhazardous\" and then he asks: \"Shall I attack?\"\r\n\r\nScott answers the same day: \"I have certainly been expecting you to beat\r\nthe Enemy.  If not, to hear that you had felt him strongly, or, at\r\nleast, had occupied him by threats and demonstrations.  You have been at\r\nleast his equal, and, I suppose, superior in numbers.  Has he not stolen\r\na march and sent re-enforcements toward Manassas Junction?  A week is\r\nenough to win victories,\" etc.\r\n\r\nPatterson retorts, on the same day: \"The Enemy has stolen no march upon\r\nme.  I have kept him actively employed, and by threats, and\r\nreconnaissances in force, caused him to be re-enforced.  I have\r\naccomplished in this respect more than the General-in-Chief asked, or\r\ncould well be expected, in face of an Enemy far superior in numbers,\r\nwith no line of communication to protect.\"\r\n\r\nIn another dispatch, to Assistant Adjutant-General Townsend (with\r\nGeneral Scott), he says, that same afternoon of Thursday, the 18th: \"I\r\nhave succeeded, in accordance with the wishes of the General-in-Chief,\r\nin keeping General Johnston's Force at Winchester.  A reconnaissance in\r\nforce, on Tuesday, caused him to be largely re-enforced from Strasburg.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, on Friday, the 19th, he informs Colonel Townsend that: \"The\r\nEnemy, from last information, are still at Winchester, and being\r\nre-enforced every night.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not until Saturday, the 20th of July, that he telegraphs to\r\nTownsend: \"With a portion of his force, Johnston left Winchester, by the\r\nroad to Millwood, on the afternoon of the 18th.\"  And he adds the\r\nridiculous statement: \"His whole force was about 35,200.\"\r\n\r\nThus, despite all the anxious care of General Scott, to have Johnston's\r\nArmy detained in the Shenandoah Valley, it has escaped Patterson so\r\nsuccessfully, and entirely, that the latter does not even suspect its\r\ndisappearance until the day before the pitched Battle of Bull Run is\r\nfought!  Its main body has actually reached Manassas twenty-four hours\r\nbefore Patterson is aware that it has left Winchester!\r\n\r\nAnd how is it, that Johnston gets away from Patterson so neatly?  And\r\nwhen does he do it?\r\n\r\n     [The extraordinary conduct of General Patterson at this critical\r\n     period, when everything seemed to depend upon his exertions, was\r\n     afterward the subject of inquiry by the Joint-Committee on the\r\n     Conduct of the War.  The testimony taken by that Committee makes it\r\n     clear, to any unprejudiced mind, that while Patterson himself may\r\n     have been loyal to the Union, he was weak enough to be swayed from\r\n     the path of duty by some of the faithless and unpatriotic officers\r\n     with whom he had partly surrounded himself--and especially by Fitz\r\n     John Porter, his Chief-of-staff.  Let us examine the sworn\r\n     testimony of two or three witnesses on this point.\r\n\r\n     General CHARLES W. SANFORD, who was second in command under\r\n     Patterson, and in command of Patterson's Left Wing, testified [see\r\n     pages 54-66, Report on Conduct of the War, Vol. 3, Part 2,] that he\r\n     was at a Council of War held at the White House, June 29th, when\r\n     the propriety of an attack on the Rebel lines at Manassas was\r\n     discussed; that he objected to any such movement until Patterson\r\n     was in such a position as to prevent the junction between General\r\n     Johnston's Army and the troops at Manassas; that on the 6th of\r\n     July, he was sent by General Scott, with four picked New York\r\n     regiments, to Patterson, and (waiving his own seniority rank)\r\n     reported to that General, at Williamsport; that Patterson gave him\r\n     command of a division of 8,000 men (and two batteries) out of a\r\n     total in his Army of 22,000; that he \"delivered orders from General\r\n     Scott to General Patterson, and urged a forward movement as soon as\r\n     possible;\" that there was \"Some delay at Martinsburg,\r\n     notwithstanding the urgency of our matter,\" but they \"left there on\r\n     [Monday] the 15th of July, and went in the direction of\r\n     Winchester,\"--down to Bunker Hill,--Patterson with two divisions\r\n     going down the turnpike, and Sanford taking his division a little\r\n     in advance and more easterly on the side roads so as to be in a\r\n     position to flank Johnston's right; that on that afternoon (Monday,\r\n     July 15) General Patterson rode up to where Sanford was locating\r\n     his camp.\r\n\r\n     Continuing his testimony, General Sanford said: \"I was then within\r\n     about nine miles of Johnston's fortified camp at Winchester.\r\n     Patterson was complimenting me upon the manner in which my\r\n     regiments were located, and inquiring about my pickets, which I had\r\n     informed him I had sent down about three miles to a stream below.\r\n     I had driven out the Enemy's skirmishers ahead of us.  They had\r\n     some cavalry there.  In answer to his compliments about the\r\n     comfortable location I had made, I said: 'Very comfortable,\r\n     General, when shall we move on?' * * *  He hesitated a moment or\r\n     two, and then said: 'I don't know yet when we shall move.  And if I\r\n     did I would not tell my own father.' I thought that was rather a\r\n     queer speech to make to me under the circumstances.  But I smiled\r\n     and said: 'General, I am only anxious that we shall get forward,\r\n     that the Enemy shall not escape us.'  He replied: 'There is no\r\n     danger of that.  I will have a reconnaissance to-morrow, and we\r\n     will arrange about moving at a very early period.'  He then took\r\n     his leave.\r\n\r\n     \"The next day [Tuesday, July 16th], there was a reconnaissance on\r\n     the Winchester turnpike, about four or five miles below the\r\n     General's camp.  He sent forward a section of artillery and some\r\n     cavalry, and they found a post-and-log fence across the Winchester\r\n     turnpike, and some of the Enemy's cavalry on the other side of it.\r\n     They gave them a round of grape.  The cavalry scattered off, and\r\n     the reconnaissance returned.  That was the only reconnaissance I\r\n     heard of while we were there.  My own pickets went further than\r\n     that.  But it was understood, the next afternoon, that we were to\r\n     march forward at daylight.  I sent down Col. Morell, with 40 men,\r\n     to open a road down to Opequan Creek, within five miles of the camp\r\n     at Winchester, on the side-roads I was upon, which would enable me,\r\n     in the course of three hours, to get between Johnston and the\r\n     Shenandoah River, and effectually bar his way to Manassas.  I had\r\n     my ammunition all distributed, and ordered my men to have 24 hours'\r\n     rations in their haversacks, independent of their breakfast.  We\r\n     were to march at 4 o'clock the next morning.  I had this road to\r\n     the Opequan completed that night.  I had then with me, in addition\r\n     to my eight regiments amounting to about 8,000 men and a few\r\n     cavalry, Doubleday's heavy United States battery of 20 and 30\r\n     pounders, and a very good Rhode Island battery.  And I was willing\r\n     to take the risk, whether Gen. Patterson followed me up or not, of\r\n     placing myself between Johnston and the Shenandoah River, rather\r\n     than let Johnston escape.  And, at 4 o'clock [July 17th] I should\r\n     have moved over that road for that purpose, if I had had no further\r\n     orders.  But, a little after 12 o'clock at night [July 16th-17th,]\r\n     I received a long order of three pages from Gen. Patterson,\r\n     instructing me to move on to Charlestown, which is nearly at right\r\n     angles to the road I was going to move on, and twenty-two miles\r\n     from Winchester.  This was after I had given my orders for the\r\n     other movement.\"\r\n\r\n               *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *\r\n\r\n     'Question [by the Chairman].--And that left Johnston free?\r\n     \"Answer--Yes, Sir; left him free to make his escape, which he did.\r\n     * * *\"\r\n\r\n     'Question.--In what direction would Johnston have had to move to\r\n     get by you?\r\n     \"Answer--Right out to the Shenandoah River, which he forded.  He\r\n     found out from his cavalry, who were watching us, that we were\r\n     actually leaving, and he started at 1 o'clock that same day, with\r\n     8,000 men, forded the Shenandoah where it was so deep that he\r\n     ordered his men to put their cartridge-boxes on their bayonets, got\r\n     out on the Leesburg road, and went down to Manassas.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Question [by the Chairman].--Did he [Patterson] assign any reason\r\n     for that movement?\r\n     \"Answer.--I was, of course, very indignant about it, and so were\r\n     all my officers and men; so much so that when, subsequently, at\r\n     Harper's Ferry, Patterson came by my camp, there was a universal\r\n     groan--against all discipline, of course, and we suppressed it as\r\n     soon as possible.  The excuse given by Gen. Patterson was this:\r\n     that he had received intelligence that he could rely upon, that\r\n     Gen. Johnston had been re-enforced by 20,000 men from Manassas,\r\n     and was going to make an attack upon him; and in the order which I\r\n     received that night--a long order of three pages--I was ordered to\r\n     occupy all the communicating roads, turning off a regiment here,\r\n     and two or three regiments there, and a battery at another place,\r\n     to occupy all the roads from Winchester to the neighborhood of\r\n     Charlestown, and all the cross-roads, and hold them all that day,\r\n     until Gen. Patterson's whole army went by me to Charlestown; and I\r\n     sat seven hours in the saddle near a place called Smithfield, while\r\n     Patterson, with his whole army, went by me on their way to\r\n     Charlestown, he being apprehensive, as he said, of an attack from\r\n     Johnston's forces.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Question [by Mr. Odell].--You covered his movement?\r\n     \"Answer--Yes, Sir.  Now the statement that he made, which came to\r\n     me through Colonel Abercrombie, who was Patterson's brother-in-law,\r\n     and commanded one division in that army, was, that Johnston had\r\n     been re-enforced; and Gen. Fitz-John Porter reported the same thing\r\n     to my officers.  Gen. Porter was then the chief of Patterson's\r\n     staff, and was a very excellent officer, and an accomplished\r\n     soldier.  They all had got this story, which was without the\r\n     slightest shadow of foundation; for there had not a single man\r\n     arrived at the camp since we had got full information that their\r\n     force consisted of 20,000 men, of whom 1,800 were sick with the\r\n     measles.  The story was, however, that they had ascertained, by\r\n     reliable information, of this re-enforcement.  Where they got their\r\n     information, I do not know.  None such reached me; and I picked up\r\n     deserters and other persons to get all the information I could; and\r\n     we since have learned, as a matter of certainty, that Johnston's\r\n     forces never did exceed 20,000 men there.  But the excuse Patterson\r\n     gave was, that Johnson had been re-enforced by 20,000 men from\r\n     Manassas, and was going to attack him.  That was the reason he gave\r\n     then for this movement.  But in this paper he has lately published,\r\n     he hints at another reason--another excuse--which was that it was\r\n     by order of Gen. Scott.  Now, I know that the peremptory order of\r\n     Gen. Scott to Gen. Patterson, repeated over and over again, was\r\n     this--I was present on several occasions when telegraphic\r\n     communications went from Gen. Scott to Gen. Patterson: Gen. Scott's\r\n     orders to Gen. Patterson were that, if he were strong enough, he\r\n     was to attack and beat Johnston.  But if not, then he was to place\r\n     himself in such a position as to keep Johnston employed, and\r\n     prevent him from making a junction with Beauregard at Manassas.\r\n     That was the repeated direction of Gen. Scott to Gen. Patterson;\r\n     and it was because of Patterson's hesitancy, and his hanging back,\r\n     and keeping so far beyond the reach of Johnston's camp, that I was\r\n     ordered to go up there and re-enforce him, and assist him in any\r\n     operations necessary to effect that object.  The excuse of Gen.\r\n     Patterson now is, that he had orders from Gen. Scott to move to\r\n     Charlestown.  Now, that is not so.  But this state of things\r\n     existed: Before the movement was made from Martinsburg, General\r\n     Patterson suggested to General Scott that Charlestown would be a\r\n     better base of operations than Martinsburg and suggested that he\r\n     had better move on Charlestown, and thence make his approaches to\r\n     Winchester; that it would be better to do that than to move\r\n     directly to Winchester from Martinsburg; and General Scott wrote\r\n     back to say that, if he found that movement a better one, he was at\r\n     liberty to make it.  But Gen. Patterson had already commenced his\r\n     movement on Winchester direct from Martinsburg, and had got as far\r\n     as Bunker Hill; so that the movement which he had formerly\r\n     suggested, to Charlestown, was suppressed by his own act.  But that\r\n     is the pretence now given in his published speech for making the\r\n     movement from Bunker Hill to Charlestown, which was a retreat,\r\n     instead of the advance which the movement to Charlestown he first\r\n     proposed to Gen. Scott was intended to be.\"\r\n\r\n                   *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *\r\n\r\n     \"Question [by the Chairman].--Was not that change of direction and\r\n     movement to Charlestown a total abandonment of the object which you\r\n     were pursuing?\r\n     \"Answer.--Entirely an abandonment of the main principles of the\r\n     orders he was acting under.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Question.--And of course an abandonment of the purpose for which\r\n     you were there?\r\n     \"Answer.--Yes, Sir.\r\n\r\n     \"Question [by Mr. Odell].-Was it not your understanding in leaving\r\n     here, and was it not the understanding also of Gen. Scott, that\r\n     your purpose in going there was to check Johnston with direct\r\n     reference to the movement here?\r\n     \"Answer--Undoubtedly.  It was in consequence of the suggestion made\r\n     by me at the Council at the President's house.  * * *  And upon the\r\n     suggestion of General Scott they wanted me to go up there and\r\n     assist Patterson in this movement against Johnston, so as to carry\r\n     out the point I had suggested of first checkmating Johnston before\r\n     the movement against Manassas was made here.\"\r\n\r\n                    *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *\r\n\r\n     Question [by the Chairman].--Would there have been any difficulty\r\n     in preventing Johnston from going to Manassas?\r\n     \"Answer.--None whatever.\"\r\n\r\n                    *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *\r\n\r\n     \"Question [by the Chairman.]--I have heard it suggested that he\r\n     (Patterson) undertook to excuse this movement on the ground that\r\n     the time of many of his troops had expired, and they refused to\r\n     accompany him.\r\n     \"Answer.--That to my knowledge, is untrue.  The time of none of\r\n     them had expired when this movement was made.  All the troops that\r\n     were there were in the highest condition for the service.  These\r\n     three-months' men, it may be well to state to you who are not\r\n     Military men, were superior to any other volunteer troops that we\r\n     had, in point of discipline.  They were the disciplined troops of\r\n     the Country.  The three-months' men were generally the organized\r\n     troops of the different States--New York, Pennsylvania, etc.  We\r\n     had, for instance, from Patterson's own city, Philadelphia, one of\r\n     the finest regiments in the service, which was turned over to me,\r\n     at their own request; and the most of my regiments were disciplined\r\n     and organized troops.  They were all in fine condition, anxious,\r\n     zealous, and earnest for a fight.  They thought they were going to\r\n     attack Johnston's camp at Winchester.  Although I had suggested to\r\n     Gen. Patterson that there was no necessity for that, the camp being\r\n     admirably fortified with many of their heavy guns from Norfolk, I\r\n     proposed to him to place ourselves between Johnston and the\r\n     Shenandoah, which would have compelled him to fight us there, or to\r\n     remain in his camp, either of which would have effected General\r\n     Scott's object.  If I had got into a fight, it was very easy, over\r\n     this road I had just been opening, for Patterson to have\r\n     re-enforced me and to have come up to the fight in time.  The\r\n     proposition was to place ourselves between Johnston's fortified\r\n     camp and the Shenandoah, where his fortified camp would have been\r\n     of no use to him.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Question.--Even if you had received a check there, it would have\r\n     prevented his junction with the forces at Manassas?\r\n     \"Answer.--Yes, Sir; I would have risked a battle with my own\r\n     division rather than Johnston should have escaped.  If he had\r\n     attacked me, I could have taken a position where I could have held\r\n     it, while Patterson could have fallen upon him and repulsed him.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Question [by Mr. Odell].--Had you any such understanding with\r\n     Patterson?\r\n     \"Answer.--I told him I would move down on this side-road in\r\n     advance, leaving Gen. Patterson to sustain me if I got into a\r\n     fight.  So, on the other hand, if he should attack Patterson, I was\r\n     near enough to fall upon Johnston's flank and to support Patterson.\r\n     By using this communication of mine to pass Opequan Creek--where, I\r\n     had informed Patterson, I had already pushed forward my pickets,\r\n     [200 men in the day and 400 more at night,] to prevent the Enemy\r\n     from burning the bridge--it would have enabled me to get between\r\n     Johnston and the Shenandoah River.  On the morning [Wednesday, July\r\n     17th] of our march to Charlestown, Stuart's cavalry, which figured\r\n     so vigorously at Bull Run, was upon my flank all day.  They were\r\n     apparently about 800 strong.  I saw them constantly on my flank for\r\n     a number of miles.  I could distinguish them, with my glass, with\r\n     great ease.  Finally, they came within about a mile of the line of\r\n     march I was pursuing and I sent a battery around to head them off,\r\n     and the 12th Regiment across the fields in double-quick time to\r\n     take them in the rear.  I thought I had got them hemmed in.  But\r\n     they broke down the fences, and went across the country to\r\n     Winchester, and I saw nothing more of them.  They were then about\r\n     eight miles from Winchester, and must have got there in the course\r\n     of a couple of hours.  That day [Wednesday, the 17th] at 10\r\n     o'clock--as was ascertained from those who saw him crossing the\r\n     Shenandoah--Johnston started from Winchester with 8,000 men, forded\r\n     the Shenandoah, and got to Manassas on Friday night; and his second\r\n     in command started the next day with all the rest of the available\r\n     troops--something like 9,000 men; leaving only the sick, and a few\r\n     to guard them, in the camp at Winchester--and they arrived at the\r\n     battle-field in the midst of the fight, got out of the cars, rushed\r\n     on the battle-field, and turned the scale.  I have no doubt that,\r\n     if we had intercepted Johnston, as we ought to have done, the\r\n     battle of Bull Run would have been a victory for us instead of a\r\n     defeat.  Johnston was undoubtedly the ablest general they had in\r\n     their army.\"\r\n\r\n     Colonel CRAIG BIDDLE, testified that he was General Patterson's\r\n     aide-de-camp at the time.  In answer to a question by the Chairman,\r\n     he continued:\r\n\r\n     \"Answer.--I was present, of course, at all the discussions.  The\r\n     discussion at Martinsburg was as to whether or not General\r\n     Patterson should go on to Winchester.  General Patterson was very\r\n     full of that himself.  He was determined to go to Winchester; but\r\n     the opinions of all the regular officers who were with him, were\r\n     against it.  The opinions of all the men in whose judgment I had\r\n     any confidence, were against it.  They seemed to have the notion\r\n     that General Patterson had got his Irish blood up by the fight we\r\n     had had at Falling Waters, and was bound to go ahead.  He decided\r\n     upon going ahead, against the remonstrances of General [Fitz John]\r\n     Porter, who advised against it.  He told me he considered he had\r\n     done his duty, and said no more.  The movement was delayed in\r\n     consequence of General Stone's command not being able to move right\r\n     away.  It was then evident that there was so much opposition to it\r\n     that the General was induced to call a council of the general\r\n     officers in his command, at which I was present.  They were\r\n     unanimously opposed to the advance.  That was at Martinsburg.\"\r\n\r\n                   *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *\r\n\r\n     \"Question.--While at Bunker Hill, the night before you left there,\r\n     were any orders issued to march in the evening?\r\n     \"Answer.--I think there were such orders.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Question.--Did not General Patterson issue orders at Bunker Hill,\r\n     the night before you marched to Charlestown, for an attack on the\r\n     Enemy?\r\n     \"Answer.-I think such orders were written.  I do not think they\r\n     were issued.  I think General Patterson was again persuaded not to\r\n     make an advance.\"\r\n\r\n     Colonel R. BUTLER PRICE, Senior aide to Patterson, testified as\r\n     follows:\r\n\r\n                    *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *\r\n\r\n     \"Question [by Mr. Gooch].--Was it not the intention to move from\r\n     Bunker Hill to Winchester?\r\n     \"Answer.--Yes, Sir.  At one time General Patterson had given an\r\n     order to move from Bunker Hill to Winchester.  He was very\r\n     unwilling to leave Johnston even at Winchester without attacking\r\n     him; and on the afternoon before we left Bunker Hill he decided to\r\n     attack him, notwithstanding his strong force.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Question.--Behind his intrenchments?\r\n     \"Answer.--Yes, Sir; it went so far that his order was written by\r\n     his adjutant, General [Fitz John] Porter.  It was very much against\r\n     the wishes of General [Fitz John] Porter; and he asked General\r\n     Patterson if he would send for Colonel Abercrombie and Colonel\r\n     Thomas and consult them on the movement.  General Patterson\r\n     replied: No, Sir; for I know they will attempt to dissuade me from\r\n     it, and I have made up my mind to fight Johnston under all\r\n     circumstances.  That was the day before we left Bunker Hill.  Then\r\n     Colonel [Fitz John] Porter asked to have Colonel Abercrombie and\r\n     Colonel Thomas sent for and consulted as to the best manner to\r\n     carry out his wishes.  He consented, and they came, and after half\r\n     an hour they dissuaded him from it.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Question.--At that time General Patterson felt it was so important\r\n     to attack Johnston that he had determined to do it?\r\n     \"Answer.--Yes, Sir; the order was not published, but it was\r\n     written.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Question.--You understood General Patterson to be influenced to\r\n     make that attempt because he felt there was a necessity for\r\n     detaining Johnston?\r\n     \"Answer.--Yes, Sir; to detain him as long as he possibly could.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Question.--That order was not countermanded until late on Tuesday,\r\n     the 16th, was it?\r\n     \"Answer.--That order never was published.  It was written; but, at\r\n     the earnest solicitation of Colonel [Fitz John] Porter, it was\r\n     withheld until he could have a consultation with Colonel\r\n     Abercrombie and Colonel Thomas.\"]\r\n\r\nIt is about 1 o'clock on the morning of Thursday, July 18th,--that same\r\nday which witnesses the preliminary Battle of Blackburn's Ford--that\r\nJohnston, being at Winchester, and knowing of Patterson's peculiarly\r\ninoffensive and timid movement to his own left and rear, on Charlestown,\r\nreceives from the Rebel Government at Richmond, a telegraphic dispatch,\r\nof July 17th, in these words: \"General Beauregard is attacked.  To\r\nstrike the Enemy a decisive blow, a junction of all your effective force\r\nwill be needed.  If practicable, make the movement.  * * *  In all the\r\narrangements exercise your discretion.\"\r\n\r\nJohnston loses no time in deciding that it is his duty to prevent, if\r\npossible, disaster to Beauregard's Army; that to do this he must effect\r\na junction with him; and that this necessitates either an immediate\r\nfight with, and defeat of, Patterson,--which may occasion a fatal\r\ndelay--or else, that Union general must be eluded.  Johnston determines\r\non the latter course.\r\n\r\nLeaving his sick, with some militia to make a pretense of defending the\r\ntown in case of attack, Johnston secretly and rapidly marches his Army,\r\nof 9,000 effective men, Southeasterly from Winchester, at noon of\r\nThursday, the 18th; across by a short cut, wading the Shenandoah River,\r\nand then on through Asby's Gap, in the Blue Ridge, that same night;\r\nstill on, in the same direction, to a station on the Manassas Gap\r\nrailroad, known as Piedmont, which is reached by the next (Friday)\r\nmorning,--the erratic movements of Stuart's Cavalry entirely concealing\r\nthe manoeuvre from the knowledge of Patterson.\r\n\r\nFrom Piedmont, the Artillery and Cavalry proceed to march the remaining\r\ntwenty-five miles, or so, to Manassas Junction, by the roads.  The 7th\r\nand 8th Georgia Regiments of Bartow's Brigade, with Jackson's Brigade,\r\n--comprising the 2d, 4th, 5th, 27th and 33d Virginia Regiments--are\r\nembarked on the cars, and hurriedly sent in advance, by rail, to\r\nManassas, reaching there on that same (Friday) afternoon and evening.\r\nThese are followed by General Johnston, with Bee's Brigade--comprising\r\nthe 4th Alabama, 2d Mississippi, and a battalion of the 11th\r\nMississippi--which arrive at Manassas about noon of Saturday, the 20th\r\nof July, the balance of Johnston's Infantry being billed for arrival\r\nthat same day, or night.\r\n\r\nUpon Johnston's own arrival at Manassas, Saturday noon,--the very day\r\nthat Patterson ascertains that \"the bird has flown,\"--after assuming\r\ncommand, by virtue of seniority, he proceeds to examine Beauregard's\r\nposition.  This he finds \"too extensive, and the ground too densely\r\nwooded and intricate,\" to be learned quickly, and hence he is impelled\r\nto rely largely upon Beauregard for information touching the strength\r\nand positions of both the Rebel and Union Armies.\r\n\r\nBeauregard has now 21,833 men, and 29 pieces of artillery of his own\r\n\"Army of the Potomac.\"  Johnston's and Holmes's junction with him has\r\nraised the Rebel total to 32,000 effectives, and 55 guns.  McDowell, on\r\nthe other hand, who started with 30,000 effectives, finds himself on the\r\n19th--owing to the departure of one of his regiments and a battery of\r\nArtillery, because of the expiration of their term of enlistment,--with\r\nbut \"28,000 men at the utmost.\"--[Comte de Paris.]\r\n\r\nOn the evening of Saturday, the 20th of July, Johnston and Beauregard\r\nhold an important consultation.  The former feels certain that\r\nPatterson, with his more than 20,000 effectives, will now lose no time\r\nin essaying a junction with McDowell's Army, and that such junction will\r\nprobably be effected by July 22nd.  Hence he perceives the necessity of\r\nattacking McDowell, and if possible, with the combined Rebel Forces,\r\nwhipping him before Patterson can come up to his assistance.\r\n\r\nAt this consultation it is agreed by the two Rebel generals to assume\r\nthe offensive, at once.  Beauregard proposes a plan of battle--which is\r\nan immediate general advance of the Rebel centre and left,\r\nconcentrating, from all the fords of Bull Run, upon Centreville, while\r\nthe Rebel right advances toward Sangster's cross-roads, ready to fall\r\neither on Centreville, or upon Fairfax Court House, in its rear,\r\naccording to circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe plan proposed, is accepted at once by Johnston.  The necessary order\r\nis drawn up by Beauregard that night; and at half past four o'clock on\r\nSunday morning, July 21st, Johnston signs the written order.  Nothing\r\nnow remains, apparently, but the delivery of the order to the Rebel\r\nbrigade commanders, a hurried preparation for the forward movement, and\r\nthen the grand attack upon McDowell, at Centreville.\r\n\r\nAlready, no doubt, the fevered brain of Beauregard pictures, in his\r\nvivid imagination, the invincible thunders of his Artillery, the\r\nimpetuous advance of his Infantry, the glorious onset of his Cavalry,\r\nthe flight and rout of the Union forces, his triumphal entry into\r\nWashington--Lincoln and Scott and the Congress crouching at his feet\r\n--and the victorious South and conquered North acclaiming him Dictator!\r\nThe plan is Beauregard's own, and Beauregard is to have command.  Hence\r\nall the glory of capturing the National Capital, must be Beauregard's.\r\nWhy not?  But \"man proposes, and God disposes.\"  The advance and attack,\r\nare, in that shape, never to be made.\r\n\r\nMcDowell, in the meantime, all unconscious of what has transpired in the\r\nShenandoah Valley, and between there and Manassas; never dreaming for an\r\ninstant that Patterson has failed to keep Johnson there--even if he has\r\nnot attacked and defeated him; utterly unsuspicious that his own\r\nlessened Union Army has now to deal with the Forces of Johnston and\r\nBeauregard combined--with a superior instead of an inferior force; is\r\nexecuting a plan of battle which he has decided upon, and announced to\r\nhis general officers, on that same Saturday evening, at his Headquarters\r\nin Centreville.\r\n\r\nInstead of attempting to turn the Enemy's right, and cut off his\r\ncommunications with Richmond and the South, McDowell has now determined\r\nto attack the Enemy's left, cut his communication, via the Manassas Gap\r\nrailroad, with Johnston's Army,--still supposed by him to be in the\r\nValley of the Shenandoah--and, taking him in the left flank and rear,\r\nroll him upon Manassas, in disorder and defeat--with whatever might\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nThat is the plan--in its general features.  In executing it, Blenker's\r\nBrigade of Miles's Division is to remain at Centreville as a reserve,\r\nthrowing up intrenchments about its Heights, upon which to fall back, in\r\ncase of necessity; Davies's Brigade of the same Division, with\r\nRichardson's Brigade of Tyler's Division--as the Left Wing--are to\r\ndemonstrate at Blackburn's Ford, toward the Enemy's right; Tyler's other\r\nthree brigades, under Keyes, Schenck, and Sherman, are to feign an\r\nattack on the Enemy's left, posted behind the strongly-defended Stone\r\nBridge over which the Warrenton turnpike, running Westward, on its way\r\nfrom Centreville to Warrenton, crosses Bull Run stream; while the strong\r\ndivisions under Hunter and Heintzelman--forming McDowell's Right Wing\r\n--are to follow Tyler's Division Westward down the turnpike to a point\r\nwithin one mile and a half of the Stone Bridge, thence, by cross-road,\r\ndiverge several miles to the North, then sweep around gradually to the\r\nWest, and then Southwardly over Bull Run at Sudley Springs Ford,\r\nswooping down the Sudley road upon the Enemy's left flank and rear, near\r\nStone Bridge, rolling it back toward his center, while Tyler's remaining\r\nthree brigades cross the bridge and join in the assault.  That is the\r\nwhole plan in a nutshell.\r\n\r\nIt has been McDowell's intention to push forward, from Centreville along\r\nthe Warrenton Pike a few miles, on the evening of this Military\r\nconference; but he makes his first mistake, in allowing himself to be\r\ndissuaded from that, by those, who, in his own words, \"have the greatest\r\ndistance to go,\" and who prefer \"starting early in the morning and\r\nmaking but one move.\"\r\n\r\nThe attacking divisions now have orders to march at 2:30 A. M., in order\r\n\"to avoid the heat,\" which is excessive.  Tyler's three immediate\r\nbrigades--or some of them--are slow in starting Westward, along the\r\nWarrenton Pike, to the Stone Bridge; and this leads to a two or three\r\nhours delay of the divisions of Hunter and Heintzelman, before they can\r\nfollow that Pike beyond Centreville, and commence the secret detour to\r\ntheir right, along the cross-road leading to Sudley Springs.\r\n\r\nAt 6:30 A.M., Tyler's Artillery gets into position, to cannonade the\r\nEnemy's batteries, on the West Bank of Bull Run, commanding the Stone\r\nBridge, and opens fire.  Half an hour before this, (at 6 A.M.), the\r\nRebel artillerists, posted on a hill South of the Pike, and 600 yards\r\nWest of the bridge, have caught sight of Tyler's Union blue-jackets.\r\nThose of the Rebel gunners whose eyes are directed to the North-East,\r\nsoon see, nearly a mile away, up the gradual slope, a puff of blue\r\nsmoke.  Immediately the bang of a solitary rifle cannon is heard, and\r\nthe scream of a rifled shot as it passes over their heads.  At\r\nintervals, until past 9 A.M., that piece and others in the same\r\nposition, keep hammering away at the Rebel left, under Evans, at Stone\r\nBridge.\r\n\r\nThe Rebel response to this cannonade, is very feeble.  McDowell observes\r\nthis.  He suspects there has been a weakening of the Enemy's force at\r\nthe bridge, in order to strengthen his right for some purpose.  And what\r\ncan that purpose be, but to throw his augmented right upon our left, at\r\nBlackburn's Ford, and so, along the ridge-road, upon Centreville?  Thus\r\nMcDowell guesses, and guesses well.  To be in readiness to protect his\r\nown left and rear, by reenforcing Miles's Division, at Centreville and\r\nalong the ridge to Blackburn's Ford, he temporarily holds back Howard's\r\nBrigade of Heintzelman's Division at the point where the cross-road to\r\nSudley Springs Ford-along which Hunter's Division, followed by the\r\nBrigades of Franklin and Wilcox, of Heintzelman's Division, have already\r\ngone-intersects the Warrenton Pike.\r\n\r\nIt is 9 o'clock.  Beauregard, as yet unaware of McDowell's new plan,\r\nsends an order to Ewell, on his right, to hold himself ready \"to take\r\nthe offensive, at a moment's notice,\"--and directing that Ewell be\r\nsupported in his advance, toward Sangster's cross-roads and the rear of\r\nCentreville, by Holmes's Brigade.  In accordance with that order, Ewell,\r\nwho is \"at Union Mills and its neighborhood,\" gets his brigade ready,\r\nand Holmes moves up to his support.  After waiting two hours, Ewell\r\nreceives another order, for both Ewell and Holmes \"to resume their\r\nplaces.\"  Something must have occurred since 9 o'clock, to defeat\r\nBeauregard's plan of attack on Centreville--with all its glorious\r\nconsequences!  What can it be?  We shall see.\r\n\r\nWhile Tyler's Artillery has been cannonading the Rebel left, under\r\nEvans, at Stone Bridge,--fully impressed with the prevailing Union\r\nbelief that the bridge is not only protected by strong masked batteries,\r\nheavy supports of Infantry, and by abatis as well as other defenses, but\r\nis also mined and ready to be blown up at the approach of our troops,\r\nwhen in reality the bridge is not mined, and the Rebel force in men and\r\nguns at that point has been greatly weakened in anticipation of\r\nBeauregard's projected advance upon Centreville,--the Union column,\r\nunder Hunter and Heintzelman, is advancing from Centreville, in the\r\nscorching heat and suffocating dust of this tropical July morning,\r\nslowly, but surely, along the Warrenton Pike and the cross-road to\r\nSudley Springs Ford--a distance of some eight miles of weary and\r\ntoilsome marching for raw troops in such a temperature--in this order:\r\nBurnside's Brigade, followed by Andrew Porter's Brigade,--both of\r\nHunter's Division; then Franklin's Brigade, followed by Willcox's\r\nBrigade,--both of Heintzelman's Division.\r\n\r\nIt is half past 9 o'clock; before Burnside's Brigade has crossed the\r\nBull Run stream, at Sudley's Ford, and the head of Andrew Porter's\r\nBrigade commences to ford it.  The troops are somewhat slow in crossing.\r\nThey are warm, tired, thirsty, and as to dust,--their hair and eyes and\r\nnostrils and mouths are full of it, while most of the uniforms, once\r\nblue, have become a dirty gray.  The sky is clear.  The sun already is\r\nfiercely hot.  The men stop to drink and fill their canteens.  It is\r\nwell they do.\r\n\r\nMcDowell, who has been waiting two or three hours at the turn, impatient\r\nat the delay, has ridden over to the front of the Flanking column, and\r\nnow reaches Sudley's Ford.  He feels that much valuable time is already\r\nlost.  His plan has, in a measure, been frustrated by delay.  He had\r\ncalculated on crossing Bull Run, at Sudley's Ford, and getting to the\r\nrear of the Enemy's position, at Stone Bridge, before a sufficient Rebel\r\nforce could be assembled to contest the Union advance.  He sends back an\r\naide with orders to the regimental commanders in the rear, to \"break\r\nfrom column, and hurry forward separately, as fast as possible.\"\r\nAnother aide he sends, with orders to Howard to bring his brigade\r\nacross-fields.  To Tyler he also sends orders to \"press forward his\r\nattack, as large bodies of the Enemy are passing in front of him to\r\nattack the division (Hunter's) which has passed over.\"\r\n\r\nIt may here be explained, that the Sudley road, running about six miles\r\nSouth-Southeasterly from Sudley Springs Ford to Manassas Junction, is\r\ncrossed at right angles, about two miles South of the Springs, by the\r\nWarrenton Pike, at a point about one mile and a half West of the Stone\r\nBridge.  For nearly a mile South of Sudley Ford, the Sudley road passes\r\nthrough thick woods on the left, and alternate patches of wooded and\r\ncleared lands on the right.  The country farther South, opens into\r\nrolling fields, occasionally cut by transverse gullies, and patched with\r\nwoods.  This is what Burnside's Brigade beholds, as it marches\r\nSouthward, along the Sudley road, this eventful morning.\r\n\r\nThus far, the cannonade of Tyler's batteries, and the weak return-fire\r\nof the Rebel Artillery, at Stone Bridge, over two miles South-East of\r\nSudley Ford, is about the only music by which the Union march has kept\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nBut now, as Burnside's foremost regiment emerges from the woods, at half\r\npast 10 o'clock, the Artillery of the Enemy opens upon it.\r\n\r\nLet us see how this happens.  Evans's Brigade, defending the Stone\r\nBridge, and constituting the Enemy's extreme left, comprises, as has\r\nalready been mentioned, Sloan's 4th South Carolina Regiment, Wheat's\r\nLouisiana battalion, Terry's squadron of Virginia Cavalry, and\r\nDavidson's section of Latham's Battery of six-pounders.\r\n\r\nEarlier in the morning Evans has supposed, from the cannonade of Tyler's\r\nbatteries among the pines on the hills obliquely opposite the Enemy's\r\nleft, as well as from the sound of the cannonade of the Union batteries\r\naway down the stream on the Enemy's right, near Blackburn's Ford, that\r\nMcDowell is about to make an attack upon the whole front of the Rebel\r\nline of defense along Bull Run-by way of the Stone Bridge, and the\r\nvarious fords below it, which cross that stream.  But by 10 o'clock,\r\nthat Rebel general begins to feel doubtful, suspicious, and uneasy.\r\nDespite the booming of Tyler's guns, he has caught in the distance the\r\nrumbling sounds of Hunter's Artillery wheels.\r\n\r\nEvans finds himself pondering the meaning of those long lines of dust,\r\naway to his left; and then, like a flash, it bursts upon him, that all\r\nthis Military hubbub in his front, and far away to his right, is but a\r\nfeint; that the real danger is somehow connected with that mysterious\r\nfar-away rumble, and those lines of yellow dust; that the main attack is\r\nto be on the unprepared left and rear of the Rebel position!\r\n\r\nNo sooner has the Rebel brigade-commander thus divined the Union plan of\r\nattack, than he prepares, with the limited force at his command, to\r\nthwart it.  Burnside and he are about equidistant, by this time, from\r\nthe intersection of the Sudley road, running South, with the Warrenton\r\nPike, running West.  Much depends upon which of them shall be the first\r\nto reach it,--and the instinctive, intuitive knowledge of this, spurs\r\nEvans to his utmost energy.  He leaves four of his fifteen companies,\r\nand Rogers's section of the Loudoun Artillery,--which has come up from\r\nCocke's Brigade, at the ford below--to defend the approaches to the\r\nStone Bridge, from the East side of Bull Run,--and, with the other\r\neleven companies, and Latham's half-battery, he hurries Westward, along\r\nthe Warrenton Pike, toward the Sudley road-crossing, to resist the\r\nimpending Union attack.\r\n\r\nIt is now 10:30 o'clock, and, as he hurries along, with anxious eyes,\r\nscanning the woods at the North, he suddenly catches the glitter of\r\nBurnside's bayonets coming down through them, East of the Sudley road,\r\nin \"column of regiments\" toward Young's Branch--a small stream turning,\r\nin a Northern and Southern loop, respectively above and below the\r\nWarrenton Pike, much as the S of a prostrate dollar-mark twines above\r\nand below its horizontal line, the vicinity of which is destined to be\r\nhotly-contested ground ere night-fall.\r\n\r\n     [Says Captain D.  P.  Woodbury, U.  S.  corps of engineers, and\r\n     who, with Captain Wright, guided the divisions of Hunter and\r\n     Heintzelman in making the detour to the upper part of Bull Run: \"At\r\n     Sudley's Mills we lingered about an hour to give the men and horses\r\n     water and a little rest before going into action, our advance guard\r\n     in the mean time going ahead about three quarters of a mile.\r\n     Resuming our march, we emerged from the woods about one mile South\r\n     of the ford, and came upon a beautiful open valley about one and a\r\n     quarter miles square, bounded on the right or West by a wooded\r\n     ridge, on the Fast by the rough spurs or bluffs of Bull Run, on the\r\n     North by an open plain and ridge, on which our troops began to\r\n     form, and on the South by another ridge, on which the Enemy was\r\n     strongly posted, with woods behind their backs.  The Enemy was also\r\n     in possession of the bluffs of Bull Run on our left.\"]\r\n\r\nSending word to Headquarters, Evans pushes forward and gaining Buck\r\nRidge, to the North of the Northern loop of Young's Branch, forms his\r\nline-of-battle upon that elevation--which somewhat compensates him for\r\nthe inferiority of his numbers--nearly at right angles to the Bull Run\r\nline; rapidly puts his Artillery in position; the Rebel guns open on\r\nBurnside's advance--their hoarse roar soon supplemented by the rattle of\r\nRebel musketry, and the answering roar and rattle of the Union onset;\r\nand the Battle of Bull Run has commenced!\r\n\r\nIt is after 10:30 A.M., and Beauregard and Johnston are upon an eminence\r\nin the rear of the centre of the Enemy's Bull Run line.  They have been\r\nthere since 8 o'clock.  An hour ago, or more, their Signal Officer has\r\nreported a large body of Union troops crossing the Bull Run Valley, some\r\ntwo or three miles above the Stone Bridge; upon the strength of which,\r\nJohnston has ordered Bee's Brigade from near Cocke's position, with\r\nHampton's Legion and Stonewall Jackson's Brigade from near Bonham's\r\nleft, to move to the Rebel left, at Stone Bridge; and these troops are\r\nnow hastening thither, guided by the sound of the guns.\r\n\r\nThe artillery-firing is also heard by Johnston and Beauregard, but\r\nintervening wooded slopes prevent them from determining precisely whence\r\nit comes.  Beauregard, with a badly-organized staff, is chaffing over\r\nthe delay that has occurred in carrying out his own plan of battle.  He\r\nis waiting to hear of the progress of the attack which he has ordered\r\nupon the Union Army,--supposed by him to be at Centreville,--and\r\nespecially as to the advance of his right toward Sangster's Station.  In\r\nthe meantime also,--from early morning,--the Rebel commanders have heard\r\nheavy firing in the direction of Blackburn's Ford, toward their right,\r\nwhere the Artillery attached to the brigades of Davies and Richardson,\r\nconstituting McDowell's Left Wing, is demonstrating in a lively manner,\r\nin accordance with McDowell's plan.\r\n\r\nIt is 11 o'clock.  Beauregard has become satisfied that his orders for\r\nthe Rebel advance and attack on Centreville, have failed or miscarried.\r\nHis plan is abandoned, and the orders countermanded.  At the same time\r\nthe growing volume of artillery-detonations upon the left of the Bull\r\nRun line of defense--together with the clouds of dust which indicate the\r\nroute of march of Hunter's and Heintzelman's Divisions from near\r\nCentreville to the point of conflict, satisfies both Johnston and\r\nBeauregard, that a serious attack is imperilling the Rebel left.\r\n\r\nBeauregard at once proposes to Johnston \"a modification of the abandoned\r\nplan,\" viz.: \"to attack with the\" Rebel \"right, while the left stands on\r\nthe defensive.\"  But rapidly transpiring events conspire to make even\r\nthe modified plan impracticable.\r\n\r\nJohnston, convinced by the still growing volume of battle-sounds on the\r\nRebel left, that the main attack of McDowell is being made there, urges\r\nBeauregard to strengthen the left, as much as possible; and, after that\r\ngeneral has sent orders to this end,--to Holmes and Early to come up\r\nwith their Brigades from Union Mills Ford, moving \"with all speed to the\r\nsound of the firing,\" and to Bonham to promptly send up, from Mitchell's\r\nFord, a battery and two of his regiments--both he and Beauregard put\r\nspurs to their horses, and gallop at full speed toward the firing, four\r\nmiles away on their left,--stopping on the way only long enough for\r\nJohnston to order his Chief-of-artillery, Colonel Pendleton, to \"follow,\r\nwith his own, and Alburtis's Batteries.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile let us return and witness the progress of the battle, on the\r\nRebel left,--where we were looking on, at 10:30 o'clock.  Evans had then\r\njust posted his eleven companies of Infantry on Buck Ridge, with one of\r\nhis two guns on his left, near the Sudley road, and the other not far\r\nfrom the Robinson House, upon the Northern spur of the elevated plateau\r\njust South of Young's Branch, and nearly midway between the Sudley road\r\nand Stone Bridge.\r\n\r\nThe battle, as we have seen, has opened.  As Burnside's Brigade appears\r\non the slope, to the North of Buck Ridge (or Hill), it is received by a\r\nrapid, well-sustained, and uncomfortable, but not very destructive fire,\r\nfrom Evans's Artillery, and, as the Union regiments press forward, in\r\ncolumn, full of impulsive ardor, the Enemy welcomes the head of the\r\ncolumn with a hot musketry-fire also, delivered from the crest of the\r\nelevation behind which the Rebel Infantry lie flat upon the ground.\r\n\r\nThis defense by Evan's demi-Brigade still continues, although half an\r\nhour, or more, has elapsed.  Burnside has not yet been able to dislodge\r\nthe Enemy from the position.  Emboldened to temerity by this fact, Major\r\nWheat's Louisiana battalion advances through the woods in front, upon\r\nBurnside, but is hurled back by a galling fire, which throws it into\r\ndisorder and flight.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, however, the brigades of Bee and Bartow--comprising the\r\n7th and 8th Georgia, 2nd Mississippi, 4th Alabama, 6th North Carolina,\r\nand two companies of the 11th Mississippi, with Imboden's Battery of\r\nfour pieces--recently arrived with Johnston from Winchester, come up,\r\nform on the right of Sloan's 4th South Carolina Regiment, while Wheat\r\nrallies his remnant on Sloan's left, now resting on the Sudley road, and\r\nthe whole new Rebel line opens a hot fire upon Burnside's Brigade.\r\n\r\nHunter, for the purpose of better directing the Union attack, is at this\r\nmoment rapidly riding to the left of the Union line,--which is advancing\r\nSouthwardly, at right angles to Bull Run stream and the old line of\r\nRebel defense thereon.  He is struck by the fragment of a shell, and\r\ncarried to the rear.\r\n\r\nColonel John S. Slocum's, 2nd Rhode Island, Regiment, with Reynold's\r\nRhode Island Battery (six 13-pounders), having been sent to the front of\r\nBurnside's left, and being closely pressed by the Enemy, Burnside's own\r\nregiment the 1st Rhode Island, is gallantly led by Major Balch to the\r\nsupport of the 2nd, and together they handsomely repulse the Rebel\r\nonset.  Burnside now sends forward Martin's 71st New York, with its two\r\nhowitzers, and Marston's 2nd New Hampshire,--his whole Brigade, of four\r\nregiments and a light artillery battery, being engaged with the heavy\r\nmasked battery (Imboden's and two other pieces), and nearly seven full\r\nregiments of the Enemy.\r\n\r\nThe regiments of Burnside's Brigade are getting considerably cut up.\r\nColonels Slocum and Marston, and Major Balch, are wounded.  There is\r\nsome confusion in the ranks, and the Rhode Island Battery is in danger\r\nof capture, when General Andrew Porter--whose own brigade has just\r\nreached the field and is deploying to the right of Burnside's--succeeds\r\nHunter in command of the division, and rides over to his left.  Burnside\r\nasks him for Sykes's battalion of regulars, which is accordingly\r\ndetached from the extreme right of Andrew Porter's Division, rapidly\r\nforms on the left, in support of the Rhode Island Battery, and opens a\r\nhot and effective fire which, in connection with the renewed fire of\r\nBurnside's rallied regiments, and the opening artillery practice of\r\nGriffin's Battery--that has just come up at a gallop and gone into a\r\ngood position upon an eminence to the right of Porter's Division, and to\r\nthe right of the Sudley road looking South--fairly staggers the Enemy.\r\n\r\nAnd now the brigades of Sherman and Keyes, having been ordered across\r\nBull Run by General Tyler, are seen advancing from Poplar Ford, at the\r\nrear of our left,--Sherman's Brigade, headed by Corcoran's 69th New York\r\nRegiment, coming up on Burnside's left, while Keves's Brigade is\r\nfollowing, to the left again of, Sherman.\r\n\r\n     [Sherman, in his Official Report, after mentioning the receipt by\r\n     him of Tyler's order to \"cross over with the whole brigade to the\r\n     assistance of Colonel Hunter\"--which he did, so far as the Infantry\r\n     was concerned, but left his battery under Ayres behind, on account\r\n     of the impassability of the bluff on the Western bank of Bull Run\r\n     --says: \"Early in the day, when reconnoitering the ground, I had seen\r\n     a horseman descend from a bluff in our front, cross the stream, and\r\n     show himself in the open field, and, inferring we could cross over\r\n     at the same point, I sent forward a company as skirmishers, and\r\n     followed with the whole brigade, the New York Sixty-ninth leading.\"\r\n\r\n     This is evidently the ford at the elbow of Bull Run, to the right\r\n     of Sherman's front, which is laid down on the Army-maps as \"Poplar\r\n     Ford,\" and which McDowell's engineers had previously discovered and\r\n     mapped; and to which Major Barnard of the U. S.  Engineer Corps\r\n     alludes when, in his Official Report, he says: \"Midway between the\r\n     Stone Bridge and Sudley Spring our maps indicated another ford,\r\n     which was said to be good.\"\r\n\r\n     The Comte de Paris, at page 241, vol. I. of his admirable \"History\r\n     of the Civil War in America,\" and perhaps other Military\r\n     historians, having assumed and stated--upon the strength of this\r\n     passage in Sherman's Report--that \"the Military instinct\" of that\r\n     successful soldier had \"discovered\" this ford; and the impression\r\n     being thus conveyed, however undesignedly, to their readers, that\r\n     McDowell's Engineer corps, after spending two or three days in\r\n     reconnaissances, had failed to find the ford which Sherman had in a\r\n     few minutes \"discovered\" by \"Military instinct;\" it is surely due\r\n     to the truth of Military history, that the Engineers be fairly\r\n     credited with the discovery and mapping of that ford, the existence\r\n     of which should also have been known to McDowell's brigade\r\n     commanders.\r\n\r\n     If, on the other hand, the Report of the Rebel Captain Arthur L.\r\n     Rogers, of the Loudoun Artillery, to General Philip St. George\r\n     Cocke, be correct, it would seem that Sherman attempted to cross\r\n     Bull Run lower down than Poplar Ford, which is \"about one mile\r\n     above the Stone Bridge,\" but was driven back by the fire of\r\n     Rogers's guns to cross at that particular ford; for Rogers, in that\r\n     Report, says that about 11 o'clock A. M., the first section of the\r\n     Loudoun Artillery, under his command, \"proceeded to the crest of\r\n     the hill on the West Side of Bull Run, commanding Stone Bridge.  *\r\n     * * Here.\"  continues he, \"I posted my section of Artillery, and\r\n     opened a brisk fire upon a column of the Enemy's Infantry, supposed\r\n     to be two regiments, advancing towards me, and supported by his\r\n     battery of rifled cannon on the hills opposite.  These poured into\r\n     my section a steady fire of shot and shell.  After giving them some\r\n     fifty rounds, I succeeded in heading his column, and turned it up\r\n     Bull Run to a ford about one mile above Stone Bridge, where, with\r\n     the regiments which followed, they crossed, and proceeded to join\r\n     the rest of the Enemy's forces in front of the main body of our\r\n     Army.\"]\r\n\r\nBefore this developing, expanding, and advancing attack of the Union\r\nforces, the Rebel General Bee, who--since his coming up to support\r\nEvans, with his own and Bartow's Brigades, to which had since been added\r\nHampton's Legion,--has been in command of this new Rebel line of defense\r\nupon the left of the Bull Run line, concludes that that attack is\r\ngetting too strong for him, and orders his forces to retreat to the\r\nSouthward, and re-form on a second line, parallel to their present line,\r\nand behind the rising ground at their rear.  They do so, somewhat faster\r\nthan he desires.  The whole line of the Rebel centre gives way, followed\r\nby the wings, as far as the victorious Union troops can see.\r\n\r\nWe must be blind if we cannot perceive that thus far, the outlook, from\r\nthe Union point of view,--despite numberless mistakes of detail, and\r\nsome, perhaps, more general in their character--is very good.  The \"Boys\r\nin Blue\" are irresistibly advancing, driving the \"Rebel Gray\" back and\r\nback, without let or hindrance, over the Buck Hill ridge, over Young's\r\nBranch, back to, and even over, the Warrenton Pike.  Time, to be sure,\r\nis flying--valuable time; but the Enemy also is retiring.--There is some\r\nslight confusion in parts of our own ranks; but there is much more in\r\nhis.  At present, we have decidedly the best of it.  McDowell's plan has\r\nbeen, thus far, successful.  Will that success continue?  We shall see.\r\n\r\nHeintzelman's Division is coming, up from the rear, to the Union right\r\n--Franklin's Brigade, made up of the 5th and 11th Massachusetts, and 1st\r\nMinnesota, with Ricketts's splendid battery of six 10-pounder Parrotts,\r\nforming on the right of Andrew Porter's Brigade and Division; while\r\nWillcox's demi-Brigade, with its 11th (\"Fire Zouaves\") and 38th New\r\nYork--having left Arnold's Battery of four pieces, with the 1st Michigan\r\nas its support, posted on a hill commanding Sudley's Ford--comes in, on\r\nthe right of Franklin, thus forming the extreme right of the advancing\r\nUnion line of attack.\r\n\r\nAs our re-enforcing brigades come up, on our right, and on our left, the\r\nEnemy falls back, more and more discouraged and dismayed.  It seems to\r\nhim, as it does to us, \"as though nothing can stop us.\"  Jackson,\r\nhowever, is now hurrying up to the relief of the flying and disordered\r\nremnants of Bee's, Bartow's, and Evans's Brigades; and these\r\nsubsequently rally, with Hampton's Legion, upon Jackson's strong brigade\r\nof fresh troops, so that, on a third new line, to which they have been\r\ndriven back, they soon have--6,500 Infantry, 13 pieces of Artillery, and\r\nStuart's cavalry-posted in a belt of pines which fringes the Southern\r\nskirt of the Henry House plateau--in a line-of-battle which, with its\r\nleft resting upon the Sudley road, three-quarters of a mile South of its\r\nintersection with the Warrenton Pike, is the irregular hypothenuse of a\r\nright-angled triangle, formed by itself and those two intersecting\r\nroads, to the South-East of such intersection.  It is within this\r\nright-angled triangular space that the battle, now proceeding, bids\r\nfair to rage most fiercely.\r\n\r\nJohnston and Beauregard, riding up from their rear, reach this new\r\n(third) line to which the Rebel troops have been driven, about noon.\r\nThey find the brigades of Bee, Bartow, and Evans, falling back in great\r\ndisorder, and taking shelter in a wooded ravine, South of the Robinson\r\nHouse and of the Warrenton Pike.  Hampton's Legion, which has just been\r\ndriven backward over the Pike, with great loss, still holds the Robinson\r\nHouse.  Jackson, however, has reached the front of this line of defense,\r\nwith his brigade of the 2nd, 4th, 5th, 27th, and 33rd Virginia Infantry,\r\nand Pendleton's Battery--all of which have been well rested, since their\r\narrival, with other brigades of Johnston's Army of the Shenandoah, from\r\nWinchester, a day or two back.\r\n\r\nAs Jackson comes up, on the left of \"the ravine and woods occupied by\r\nthe mingled remnants of Bee's, Bartow's and Evans's commands,\" he posts\r\nImboden's, Stanard's, and Pendleton's Batteries in line, \"below the brim\r\nof the Henry House plateau,\" perhaps one-eighth of a mile to the\r\nEast-Southeastward of the Henry House, at his centre; Preston's 4th\r\nVirginia, and Echol's 27th Virginia, at the rear of the battery-line;\r\nHarper's 5th Virginia, with Radford's Cavalry, at its right; and, on its\r\nleft, Allen's 2nd Virginia; with Cumming's 33rd Virginia to the left of\r\nthat again, and Stuart's Cavalry covering the Rebel left flank.\r\n\r\nIt is about this time that the chief Rebel generals find their position\r\nso desperate, as to necessitate extraordinary measures, and personal\r\nexposure, on their part.  Now it is, that Jackson earns the famous\r\nsobriquet which sticks to him until he dies.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [Bee approaches Jackson--so goes the story, according to Swinton;\r\n     he points to the disordered remnants of his own brigade mingled\r\n     with those of the brigades of Bartow and Evans huddled together in\r\n     the woods, and exclaims: \"General, they are beating us back!\"\r\n     \"Sir,\" responds Jackson, drawing himself up, severely, \"We'll give\r\n     them the bayonet!\" And Bee, rushing back among his confused troops,\r\n     rallies them with the cry: \"There is Jackson, standing like a Stone\r\n     wall!  Let us determine to die here, and we will conquer.\"]\r\n\r\nNow it is, that Johnston and Beauregard, accompanied by their staffs,\r\nride backward and forward among the Rebel ranks, rallying and\r\nencouraging them.  Now it is, that, Bee and Bartow and Hampton being\r\nwounded, and the Lieutenant-Colonel of the Hampton Legion killed,\r\nBeauregard leads a gallant charge of that legion in person.  And now it\r\nis, that Johnston himself, finding all the field-officers of the 4th\r\nAlabama disabled, \"impressively and gallantly charges to the front\" with\r\nthe colors of that regiment at his side!\r\n\r\nThese conspicuous examples of bravery, inspire the Rebel troops with\r\nfresh courage, at this admittedly \"critical\" moment.\r\n\r\nJohnston now assigns to Beauregard the chief \"command of the left\" of\r\nthe Bull Run line,--that is to say, the chief command of the Enemy's new\r\nline of defense, which, as we have seen, is on the left of, and at right\r\nangles to, the old Bull Run line--while he himself, riding back to the\r\nLewis House, resumes \"the command of the whole field.\"\r\n\r\nOn his way to his rear, Johnston orders Cocke to send reenforcements to\r\nBeauregard.  He also dispatches orders to hurry up to that Rebel\r\ngeneral's support, the brigades of Holmes and Early from near the Union\r\nMills Ford, and that of Bonham  from Mitchell's Ford,--Ewell with his\r\nbrigade,  being also directed to \"follow with all speed\" from Union\r\nMills Ford-making a total of over 10,000 fresh troops.\r\n\r\nFrom the \"commanding elevation\" of the Lewis House, Johnston can observe\r\nthe position of the Union forces beyond Bull Run, at Blackburn's Ford\r\nand Stone Bridge; the coming of his own re-enforcing brigades from far\r\ndown the valley, toward Manassas; and the manoeuvres of our advancing\r\ncolumns under McDowell.\r\n\r\nAs the battle proceeds, the Enemy's strength on the third new line of\r\ndefense increases, until he has 22 guns, 260 Cavalry, and 12 regiments\r\nof Infantry, now engaged.  It is interesting to observe also, that, of\r\nthese, 16 of the guns, 9 of the regiments, and all of the Cavalry\r\n(Stuart's), belong to Johnston's Army of the Shenandoah, while only 6\r\nguns and 3 Infantry regiments thus engaged, belong to Beauregard's Army\r\nof the Potomac.  Thus the burden of the battle has been, and is being,\r\nborne by Johnston's, and not Beauregard's troops--in the proportion of\r\nabout three of the former, to one of the latter,--which, for over two\r\nhours, maintain their position despite many successive assaults we make\r\nupon them.\r\n\r\nIt is after 2 o'clock P.M., when Howard's Brigade, of Heintzelman's\r\nDivision, reaches the battle-field, almost broken down with exhaustion.\r\nBy order of Heintzelman it has moved at double-quick for a mile of the\r\nway, until, under the broiling heat, it can do so no longer.  The last\r\ntwo miles of the weary tramp, while the head of the brigade has moved at\r\nquick time, the rear, having lost distances, moves, much of the time, at\r\na double-quick.  As a consequence, many of Howard's men drop out, and\r\nabsolutely faint from exhaustion.\r\n\r\nAs Howard's Brigade approaches the field, besides the ambulances and\r\nlitters, conveying to the rear the wounded and dying, crowds of\r\nretreating stragglers meet and tell it to hurry along; that the Enemy\r\nhas been driven back a mile; but, as it marches along, its regiments do\r\nnot feel particularly encouraged by the disorganization so prevalent;\r\nand the fact that as they come into action, the thunders of the Rebel\r\nArtillery do not seem to meet an adequately voluminous response--from\r\nthe Union side, seems to them, a portent of evil.  Weary and fagged out,\r\nthey are permitted to rest, for a while, under cover.\r\n\r\nUp to this time, our line, increased, as it has been, by the brigades of\r\nSherman and Keyes, on the left of Burnside, and of Franklin and Wilcox,\r\non the right of Porter, has continued to advance victoriously.  Our\r\ntroops are, to be sure, considerably scattered, having been \"moved from\r\npoint to point\" a good deal.  On our left, the Enemy has been driven\r\nback nearly a mile, and Keyes's Brigade is pushing down Bull Run, under\r\nshelter of the bluffs, trying to turn the right of the Enemy's new line,\r\nand give Schenck's Brigade a better chance for crossing the Stone\r\nBridge, still commanded by some of the Rebel guns.\r\n\r\nHaving \"nothing to do\" there, \"several of the Union regiments\" are\r\ncoming over, from our left toward our right, with a view of overlapping,\r\nand turning, the Enemy's left.\r\n\r\nIt is about half past 2 o'clock.  The batteries of Griffin and Ricketts\r\nhave already been advanced as far as the eminence, upon our right, upon\r\nwhich stands the Dogan House.  Supported by Lyons's gallant 14th New\r\nYork Chasseurs, Griffin's and Ricketts's Batteries are still pouring a\r\nterribly destructive fire into the batteries and columns of the Enemy,\r\nnow behind the brow of the Henry House hill, wherever exposed, while\r\nPalmer's seven companies of Union Cavalry are feeling the Enemy's left\r\nflank, which McDowell proposes to turn.  The flags of eight Union\r\nregiments, though \"borne somewhat wearily\" now point toward the hilly\r\nHenry House plateau, beyond which \"disordered masses of Rebels\" have\r\nbeen seen \"hastily retiring.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a lull in the battle.  The terrible heat is exhausting to the\r\ncombatants on both sides.  Griffin and Ricketts have wrought such havoc\r\nwith their guns, that \"nothing remains to be fired at.\"  Victory seems\r\nmost surely to be ours.\r\n\r\nAway down at his headquarters at the Lewis House, the Rebel General\r\nJohnston stands watching the progress of the battle, as it goes against\r\nhim.  Nervously he glances, every now and then, over his left shoulder,\r\nas if expecting something.  An officer is galloping toward him, from\r\nManassas.  He comes from the office of Beauregard's Adjutant-General, at\r\nthat point.  He rides up and salutes.  \"General,\" says he, breathlessly,\r\n\"a United States Army has reached the line of the Manassas Gap railroad,\r\nand is now but three or four miles from our left flank!\"\r\n\r\nJohnston clenches his teeth nervously.  Thick beads of perspiration\r\nstart from his forehead.  He believes it is Patterson's Army that has\r\nfollowed \"upon his heels\" from before Winchester, faster than has been\r\nanticipated; and, as he thinks of Kirby Smith, who should long since\r\nhave arrived with Elzey's Brigade--all, of his own \"Army of the\r\nShenandoah,\" that has not yet followed him to Manassas,--the exclamation\r\ninvoluntarily bursts from his lips: \"Oh, for four regiments!\"\r\n\r\n     [Says a correspondent and eye-witness of the battle, writing to the\r\n     Richmond Dispatch, from the battle-field, July 23d: \"Between two\r\n     and three o'clock large numbers of men were leaving the field, some\r\n     of them wounded, others exhausted by the long struggle, who gave us\r\n     gloomy reports; but, as the firing on both sides continued\r\n     steadily, we felt sure that our brave Southerners had not been\r\n     conquered by the overwhelming hordes of the North.  It is, however,\r\n     due to truth to say that the result at this hour hung trembling in\r\n     the balance.  We had lost numbers of our most distinguished\r\n     officers.  Gens. Barlow and Bee had been stricken down; Lieut; Col.\r\n     Johnson of the Hampton Legion had been killed; Col. Hampton had\r\n     been wounded.  But there was at hand a fearless general whose\r\n     reputation was staked on this battle: Gen. Beauregard promptly\r\n     offered to lead the Hampton Legion into action, which he executed\r\n     in a style unsurpassed and unsurpassable.  Gen. Beauregard rode up\r\n     and down our lines, between the Enemy and his own men, regardless\r\n     of the heavy fire, cheering and encouraging our troops.  About this\r\n     time, a shell struck his horse, taking its head off, and killing\r\n     the horses of his aides, Messrs. Ferguson and Hayward.  * * *  Gen.\r\n     Johnston also threw himself into the thickest of the fight, seizing\r\n     the colors of a Georgia (Alabama) regiment, and rallying then to\r\n     the charge.  * * *  Your correspondent heard Gen. Johnston exclaim\r\n     to Gen. Cocke, just at the critical moment, 'Oh, for four\r\n     regiments!'  His wish was answered; for in the distance our\r\n     re-enforcements appeared.  The tide of battle was turned in our favor\r\n     by the arrival of Gen. Kirby Smith, from Winchester, with 4,000 men\r\n     of Gen. Johnston's Division.  Gen. Smith heard, while on the\r\n     Manassas Railroad cars, the roar of battle.  He stopped the train,\r\n     and hurried his troops across the fields to the point just where he\r\n     was most needed.  They were at first supposed to be the Enemy,\r\n     their arrival at that point of the field being entirely unexpected.\r\n     The Enemy fell back, and a panic seized them.  Cheer after cheer\r\n     from our men went up, and we knew the battle had been won.\"\r\n\r\n     Another Rebel correspondent who, as an officer of the Kentucky\r\n     battalion of General Johnston's Division of the Rebel Army,\r\n     participated in the battle, wrote to the Louisville Courier from\r\n     Manassas, July 22, an account of it, in which, after mentioning\r\n     that the Rebel Army had been forced back for two miles, he\r\n     continues; \"The fortunes of the day were evidently against us.\r\n     Some of our best officers had been slain, and the flower of our\r\n     Army lay strewn upon the field, ghastly in death or gaping with\r\n     wounds.  At noon, the cannonading is described as terrific.  It was\r\n     an incessant roar for more than two hours, the havoc and\r\n     devastation at this time being fear ful.  McDowell * * * had nearly\r\n     outflanked us, and they were just in the act of possessing\r\n     themselves of the Railway to Richmond.  Then all would have been\r\n     lost.  But most opportunely--I may say Providentially--at this\r\n     juncture, Gen. Johnston, [Kirby Smith it should be] with the\r\n     remnant of Johnston's Division--our Army, as we fondly call it, for\r\n     we have been friends and brothers in camp and field for three\r\n     months--reappeared, and made one other desperate struggle to obtain\r\n     the vantage-ground.  Elzey's Brigade of Marylanders and Virginians\r\n     led the charge; and right manfully did they execute the work,\"]\r\n\r\n\"The prayer of the wicked availeth not,\" 'tis said; yet never was the\r\nprayer of the righteous more quickly answered than is that of the Rebel\r\nGeneral-in-chief!  Johnston himself, alluding to this exigent moment,\r\nafterward remarks, in his report: \"The expected reenforcements appeared\r\nsoon after.\"  Instead of Patterson's Union Army, it is Kirby Smith,\r\ncoming up, with Elzey's Brigade, from Winchester!\r\n\r\nSatisfied of the safe arrival of Kirby Smith, and ordering him up, with\r\nElzey's Brigade, Johnston directs Kershaw's 2nd and Cash's 8th South\r\nCarolina Regiments, which have just come up, with Kemper's Battery, from\r\nBonham's Brigade, to strengthen the Rebel left, against the attempt\r\nwhich we are still making to reach around it, about the Sudley road, to\r\ntake it in reverse.  Fisher's 6th North Carolina Regiment arriving about\r\nthe same time, is also hurried along to help Beauregard.\r\n\r\nBut during the victorious lull, heretofore alluded to, something is\r\nhappening on our side, that is of very serious moment.  Let us see what\r\nit is:\r\n\r\nThe batteries of Griffin and Ricketts, at the Dogan House, having\r\nnothing to fire at, as we have seen, are resting, pleased with the\r\nconsciousness of their brilliant and victorious service against the\r\nRebel batteries and Infantry columns, when they are ordered by McDowell\r\n--who, with his staff, is upon elevated ground to the rear of our\r\nright,--to advance 1,000 yards further to the front, \"upon a hill near\r\nthe Henry House.\"\r\n\r\nRicketts considers this a perilous job--but proceeds to execute the\r\norder as to his own battery.  A small ravine is in his front.  With\r\nRicketts gallantly leading, the battery dashes across the ravine at full\r\ngallop, breaking one wheel as it goes, which is at once replaced.  A\r\nfence lies across the way.  The cannoniers demolish it.  The battery\r\nascends the hill near the Henry House, which is full of the Enemy's\r\nsharpshooters.\r\n\r\n     [For this, and what immediately follows, see the testimony of\r\n     Ricketts and others, before the Committee on the Conduct of the\r\n     War.]\r\n\r\nSoon as Ricketts gets his guns in battery, his men and horses begin to\r\nfall, under the fire of these sharpshooters.  He turns his guns upon the\r\nHenry House,--and \"literally riddles it.\"  Amid the moans of the\r\nwounded, the death scream of a woman is heard!  The Enemy had permitted\r\nher to remain in her doomed house!\r\n\r\nBut the execution is not all on one side, by any means.  Ricketts is in\r\na very hot place--the hottest, he afterward declares, that he has ever\r\nseen in his life--and he has seen fighting before this.\r\n\r\nThe Enemy is behind the woods, at the front and right of Ricketts's\r\nBattery.  This, with the added advantage of the natural slope of the\r\nground, enables him to deliver upon the brave Union artillerists a\r\nconcentrated fire, which is terribly destructive, and disables so many\r\nof Rickett's horses that he cannot move, if he would.  Rickett's own\r\nguns, however, are so admirably served, that a smooth-bore battery of\r\nthe Enemy, which has been stubbornly opposing him, is driven back,\r\ndespite its heavy supports.\r\n\r\nAnd Griffin's Battery now comes rapidly up into position on the left of,\r\nand in line with, Ricketts.  For Griffin also has been ordered from the\r\nDogan House hill, to this new, and dangerously exposed, position.\r\n\r\nBut when Major Barry, General McDowell's Chief of Artillery, brings him\r\nthe order, Griffin hesitates--for he has no Infantry support.\r\n\r\n\"The Fire Zouaves--[The 11th New York]--will support you,\" says Barry,\"\r\nThey are just ready to follow you at the double-quick!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why not let them go and get in position on the hill,\" says\r\nGriffin; \"then, let Ricketts's and my batteries come into battery\r\nbehind; and then, let them (the Zouaves) fall back?\"\r\n\r\nGriffin advises, also, as a better position for his own battery, a hill\r\n500 yards in the rear of the Henry House hill.  But advice is thrown\r\naway.  His artillery-chief is inflexible.\r\n\r\n\"I tell you,\" says Griffin again, \"the Fire Zouaves won't support us.\"\r\n\r\n\"They will,\" replies Barry.  \"At any rate it is General McDowell's order\r\nto go there!\"\r\n\r\nThat settles the business.  \"I will go,\" responds Griffin; \"but mark my\r\nwords, they will not support us!\"\r\n\r\nGriffin's Battery, indeed, starts first, but, owing to the mistake of\r\none of his officers, it has to be countermarched, so that Ricketts's is\r\nthrown to the front, and, as we have seen, first reaches the crest of\r\nthe Henry House hill.\r\n\r\nGriffin, as he comes up with his guns, goes into battery on the left of\r\nRicketts, and at once opens briskly on the Enemy.  One of Griffin's guns\r\nhas a ball lodged in the bore, which cannot be got in or out.  His other\r\nfive guns, with the six guns of Ricketts, make eleven pieces, which are\r\nnow side by side-all of them driving away at the Enemy's (Stonewall\r\nJackson's) strong batteries, not more than 300 yards away.\r\n\r\nThey have been at it half an hour perhaps, when Griffin moves two of his\r\npieces to the right of Ricketts, and commences firing with them.  He has\r\nhardly been there five minutes, when a Rebel regiment coming out of the\r\nwoods at Griffin's right front, gets over a rail fence, its Colonel\r\nsteps out between his regiment (now standing up to the knees in rank\r\ngrass) and the battery, and commences a speech to his men!\r\n\r\nGriffin orders one of his officers to load with canister, and let\r\ndrive at them.  The guns are loaded, and ready to fire, when up gallops\r\nBarry, exclaiming: \"Captain, don't fire there; those are your\r\nbattery-supports!\"\r\n\r\nAt this supreme moment, Reynolds's gorgeous looking Marines are sitting\r\ndown in close column, on the ground, to the left of the Union batteries.\r\nThe showy 11th New York \"Fire Zouaves\" are a little to the rear of the\r\nright of the guns.  The gallant 14th New York Chasseurs, in their\r\ndust-covered red uniforms, who had followed Griffin's Battery, at some\r\ndistance, have, only a little while since, pushed finely up, from the\r\nravine at the rear of our batteries, into the woods, to the right of\r\nGriffin and Ricketts, at a double-quick.  To the left of the batteries,\r\nclose to the battalion of Marines, Heintzelman bestrides his horse, near\r\nsome of his own Division.\r\n\r\nTo Major Barry's startling declaration, Captain Griffin excitedly\r\nshouts: \"They are Confederates!  Sure as the world, they are\r\nConfederates!\"\r\n\r\nBut Barry thinks he knows better, and hastily responds: \"I know they are\r\nyour battery-support.\"\r\n\r\nGriffin spurs toward his pieces, countermands his previous order,\r\nand firing is resumed in the old direction.\r\n\r\nAndrew Porter, has just ridden up to Heintzelman's side, and now catches\r\nsight of the Rebel regiment.  \"What troops are those?\" he asks of\r\nGeneral Hientzelman, pointing in their direction.\r\n\r\nWhile Heintzelman is replying, and just as Averell drops his reins and\r\nlevels his field-glass at them, \"down come their pieces-rifles and\r\nmuskets,--and probably,\" as Averell afterward said, \"there never was\r\nsuch a destructive fire for a few minutes.  It seemed as though every\r\nman and horse of that battery just laid right down, and died right off!\"\r\n\r\nIt is a dreadful mistake that has been made.  And there seems to have\r\nbeen no excuse for it either.  The deliberateness of the Rebel colonel\r\nhas given Barry abundant time to have discovered his error.  For Griffin\r\nsubsequently declared, under oath, that, \"After the officer who had been\r\ntalking to the regiment had got through, he faced them to the left,\r\nmarched them about fifty yards to the woods, then faced them to the\r\nright again, marched them about forty yards toward us, then opened fire\r\nupon us--and that was the last of us!\"\r\n\r\nIt is a terrible blunder.  For, up to this moment, the battle is\r\nundeniably ours.  And, while the Rebel colonel has been haranguing his\r\nbrave men, there has been plenty of time to have \"passed the word\" along\r\nthe line of our batteries, and poured canister into the Rebel regiment\r\nfrom the whole line of eleven guns, at point-blank range, which must\r\ninevitably have cut it all to pieces.  The fate of the day hung balanced\r\nright there and then--with all the chances in favor of McDowell.  But\r\nthose chances are now reversed.  Such are the fickle changes in the\r\nfortunes of battle!\r\n\r\nInstead of our batteries cutting to pieces the Rebel Infantry regiment,\r\nthe Rebel Infantry regiment has mowed down the gallant artillerists of\r\nour batteries.  Hardly a man of them escapes.  Death and destruction\r\nreap a wondrous and instant harvest.  Wounded, dying, or dead, lie the\r\nbrave cannoniers at their guns, officers and men alike hors du combat,\r\nwhile wounded horses gallop wildly back, with bounding caissons, down\r\nthe gentle declivity, carrying disorder, and further danger, in their\r\nmad flight.\r\n\r\nThe supporting Fire Zouaves and Marines, on the right and left of our\r\nline of guns, stand, with staring eyes and dumb open-mouths, at the\r\nsudden turn of affairs.  They are absolutely paralyzed with\r\nastonishment.  They do not run at first.  They stand, quaking and\r\npanic-stricken.  They are urged to advance upon the Rebel regiment\r\n--\"to give them a volley, and then try the bayonet.\"  In vain!  They\r\nfire perhaps 100 scattering shots; and receive in return, as they break\r\nand run down the hill to the rear, volley after volley, of deadly lead,\r\nfrom the Rebel muskets.\r\n\r\nBut, as this Rebel regiment (Cummings's 33rd Virginia) advances to seize\r\nthe crippled and defenceless guns, it is checked, and driven back, by\r\nthe 1st Michigan Regiment of Willcox's Brigade, which has pushed forward\r\nin the woods at our extreme right.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, having been ordered by McDowell to support Ricketts's\r\nBattery, Howard has formed his four tired regiments into two lines\r\n--Berry's 4th Maine, and Whitney's 2nd Vermont, on the right and left of\r\nthe first; and Dunnell's 5th, and his own 3rd Maine, under Staples, in\r\nthe second line.  Howard himself leads his first line up the elevated\r\nplateau of the Henry House.  Reaching the crest, the line delivers its\r\nfire, volley after volley, despite the concentrated hail of the Enemy's\r\nArtillery and muskets.  As the second line advances, a Rebel\r\ncannon-ball, and an unfortunate charge of our own Cavalry, scatters most\r\nof the 5th Maine.  The 2nd Vermont, which has advanced 200 yards beyond\r\nthe crest, rapidly firing, while the Enemy retires, is now, in turn,\r\nforced back by the Enemy's hot fire, and is replaced by the 3rd Maine,\r\nwhile the remnant of the 5th moves up to the extreme right of Howard's\r\nnow single line.  But the Rebel fire grows hotter and hotter, and owing\r\nto this, and a misunderstood order, Howard's line begins to dissolve,\r\nand then retires in confusion,--Howard and others vainly striving to\r\nrally his own utterly exhausted men.\r\n\r\nSherman's Brigade, too, has come over from our left, and now advances\r\nupon the deadly plateau, where lie the disabled Union batteries--the\r\nprizes, in full sight of both Armies, for which each seems now to be so\r\ndesperately striving.\r\n\r\nQuinby's 13th New York Rifles, in column of companies, leads the\r\nbrigade, followed by Lieutenant-Colonel Peck's 2d Wisconsin, Cameron's\r\n79th New York (Highlanders), and Corcoran's 69th New York (Irish), \"in\r\nline of battle.\"  Down the slope, across the ravine, and up, on the\r\nother side, steadily presses Quinby, till he reaches the crest.  He\r\nopens fire.  An advancing Rebel regiment retires, as he pushes up to\r\nwhere the Union batteries and cannoniers lie wounded and dying--the\r\nother three regiments following in line-of-battle until near the crest,\r\nwhen the fire of the Enemy's rifles and musketry, added to his heavy\r\ncannonading, grows so severe that the brigade is forced back to shelter\r\nin a roadway leading up the plateau.\r\n\r\nPeck's 2nd Wisconsin, now emerges from this sheltered roadway, and\r\nsteadily mounts the elevation, in the face of the Enemy's severe fire\r\n--returning it, with spirit, as it advances.  But the Rebel fire becomes\r\ntoo galling.  The gray-clad Wisconsin boys return to the sheltered road\r\nagain, while the cry goes up from Sherman's ranks: \"Our own men are\r\nfiring at them!\"  Rallying at the road, the 2nd Wisconsin again returns,\r\nwith desperate courage, to the crest of the hill, delivers its fire, and\r\nthen, unable to withstand the dreadful carnage, falls back once more, in\r\ndisorder.\r\n\r\nAt this, the 79th (Highland) Regiment springs forward, to mount the brow\r\nof the fatal hill, swept as it is, with this storm of shot and shell and\r\nmusket-balls.  Up, through the lowering smoke, lit with the Enemy's\r\nincessant discharges in the woods beyond, the brave Highlanders jauntily\r\nmarch, and, with Cameron and their colors at their head, charge\r\nimpetuously across the bloody hill-crest, and still farther, to the\r\nfront.  But it is not in human nature to continue that advance in the\r\nteeth of the withering fire from Jackson's batteries, strengthened, as\r\nthey are, by Pelham's and Kemper's.  The gallant fellows fall back,\r\nrally again, advance once more, retire again, and at last,--the heroic\r\nCameron being mortally wounded,--fall back, in confusion, under the\r\ncover of the hill.\r\n\r\nAnd now, while Quinby's Regiment, on another ridge, more to the left, is\r\nalso again engaging the Enemy, the 69th New York, led by the fearless\r\nCorcoran, dashes forward, up the Henry House hill, over the forbidding\r\nbrow, and beyond.  As the brave Irishmen reach the abandoned batteries,\r\nthe hoarse roar of cannon, the sharp rattle of musketry-volleys, the\r\nscream of shot and shell, and the whistling of bullets, is at once\r\ndeafening and appalling, while the air seems filled with the iron and\r\nleaden sleet which sweeps across the scorched and blasted plateau of the\r\nHenry House.  Nobly the Irish Regiment holds its ground for a time; but,\r\nat last, it too falls back, before the hurtling tempest.\r\n\r\nThe fortunes of the day are plainly turning against us.  Time is also\r\nagainst us--as it has been all along--while it is with the Enemy.  It is\r\npast 3 o'clock.\r\n\r\nSince we last looked at Beauregard's third new defensive line, there\r\nhave been material accessions to it.  The remains of the brigades of\r\nBee, Evans, and Bartow, have been reformed on the right of Jackson's\r\nBrigade--Bee on his immediate right, Evans to the right of Bee, and\r\nBartow to the right of Evans, with a battery which has been engaging\r\nSchenck's Brigade on the other side of Bull Run near the Stone Bridge;\r\nwhile Cocke's Brigade watches Bull Run to the rear of Bartow.  On the\r\nleft of Jackson's.  Brigade, is now to be seen a part of Bonham's\r\nBrigade (Kershaw's 2nd South Carolina, and Cash's 8th South Carolina)\r\nwith Kemper's Battery on its left.  Kirby Smith has reached the front,\r\nfrom Manassas, and--in advancing from his position on the left of\r\nBonham's demi-Brigade, just West of the Sudley road, with Elzey's\r\nBrigade, in a counter-attack upon our right-is wounded, and carried to\r\nthe rear, leaving his command to Elzey.  Stuart's Cavalry are in the\r\nwoods, still farther to the Enemy's left, supporting Beckham's Battery.\r\nEarly's Brigade is also coming up, from Union Mills Ford, not far to the\r\nrear of the Enemy's left, with the design of coming into line between\r\nElzey's Brigade and Beckham's Battery, and out-flanking and attacking\r\nour right.  But let us bring our eyes back to the bloody contest, still\r\ngoing on, for the possession of the batteries of Griffin and Ricketts.\r\n\r\nArnold's Battery has raced up on our right, and is delivering shot,\r\nshell, spherical case, and canister, with effect, although exposed to a\r\nsevere and accurate fire from the Enemy.  Wilcox, with what is left of\r\nthe 1st Michigan, after once retaking the batteries on the plateau, from\r\nthe 7th Georgia, has got around the Enemy's left flank and is actually\r\nengaged with the Enemy's rear, while that Enemy's front is engaged with\r\nFranklin and Sherman!  But Hobart Ward's 38th New York, which Wilcox has\r\nordered up to support the 1st Michigan, on our extreme right, in this\r\nflanking movement, has been misdirected, and is now attacking the\r\nEnemy's centre, instead of his left; and Preston's 28th Virginia--which,\r\nwith Withers's 18th Virginia, has come up to the Rebel left, from\r\nCocke's Brigade, on the Enemy's right--finding the 1st Michigan broken,\r\nin the woods, attacks it, and wounds and captures Wilcox.  Withers's\r\nRegiment has, with a yell--the old \"Rebel yell,\" now rising everywhere\r\nfrom Rebel throats, and so often heard afterward,--charged the 14th New\r\nYork Chasseurs, in the woods; and the Chasseurs, though retiring, have\r\nfired upon it with such precision as to throw some of their assailants\r\ninto disorder.\r\n\r\n     [Says General Keyes, who had kept on down the Run, \"on the extreme\r\n     left of our advance--having separated from Sherman on his right:--I\r\n     thought the day was won about 2 o'clock; but about half past 3\r\n     o'clock a sudden change in the firing took place, which, to my ear,\r\n     was very ominous.  I knew that the moment the shout went up from\r\n     the other side, there appeared to be an instantaneous change in the\r\n     whole sound of the battle.  * * *  That, as far as I can learn, was\r\n     the shout that went up from the Enemy's line when they found out\r\n     for certain that it was Johnston [Kirby Smith] and not Patterson,\r\n     that had come.\"]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile McDowell is making one more effort to retrieve the misfortunes\r\nof the day.  Lawrence's 5th, and Clark's 11th Massachusetts, with\r\nGorman's 1st Minnesota,--all belonging to Franklin's Brigade--together\r\nwith Corcoran's 69th New York, of Sherman's Brigade, have been brought\r\ninto line-of-battle, by the united efforts of Franklin, Averell, and\r\nother officers, at our centre, and with the remnants of two or three\r\nother regiments, are moving against the Enemy's centre, to support the\r\nattack of the Chasseurs-rallied and led forward again by Heintzelman\r\nupon the Rebel left, and that of the 38th New York upon the Rebel left\r\ncentre,--in another effort to recapture the abandoned batteries.\r\n\r\nCharge after charge, is made by our gallant regiments, and\r\ncounter-charge after counter-charge, is made by the fresh troops of the\r\nEnemy. For almost half an hour, has the contest over the batteries\r\nrolled backward and forward.  Three several times have the batteries\r\nbeen taken, and re-taken,--much of the determined and desperate struggle\r\ngoing on, over the prostrate and bleeding bodies of the brave Union\r\nartillerists,--but without avail.  Regiment after regiment, has been\r\nthrown back, by the deadly fusillade of the Enemy's musketry from the\r\nskirt of woods at his front and left, and the canister, case, and\r\nbursting shells, of his rapidly-served Artillery.\r\n\r\nIt is now near upon 4 o'clock.  Our last effort to recapture the\r\nbatteries has failed.  The Union line of advance has been seriously\r\nchecked.  Some of our own guns in those batteries are turned on us.  The\r\nEnemy's Infantry make a rush over the blood-soaked brow of the fatal\r\nplateau, pouring into our men a deadly fire, as they advance,--while\r\nover to our right and rear, at the same moment, are seen the fresh\r\nregiments of Early's Brigade coming out of the woods--deploying rapidly\r\nin several lines--with Stuart's handful of Rebel Cavalry, while\r\nBeckham's guns, in the same quarter, open an oblique enfilading reverse\r\nfire upon us, in a lively manner.\r\n\r\nAt once the minds of the fagged-out Union troops become filled with the\r\ndispiriting idea that the exhausting fight which they have made all day\r\nlong, has been simply with Beauregard's Army of the Potomac, and that\r\nthese fresh Rebel troops, on the Union right and rear, are the vanguard\r\nof Johnston's Army of the Shenandoah!  After all the hard marching and\r\nfighting they have done during the last thirteen hours,--with empty\r\nstomachs, and parched lips, under a scorching sun that still, as it\r\ndescends in the West, glowers down upon them, through the murky air,\r\nlike a great, red, glaring eye,--the very thought is terrible!\r\n\r\nWithout fear, yet equally without hope, the Union troops crumble to\r\ngroups, and then to individuals.  The attempt of McDowell to turn the\r\nleft of the Enemy's Bull Run line, has failed.\r\n\r\nMcDowell and his officers heroically but vainly strive, at great\r\npersonal risk to themselves, to stem the tide of confusion, and\r\ndisorder.  Sykes's battalion of regulars, which has been at our left,\r\nnow steadily moves obliquely across the field of battle toward our\r\nright, to a hill in the midground, which it occupies, and, with the aid\r\nof Arnold's Battery and Palmer's Cavalry, holds, while the exhausted and\r\ndisorganized troops of the Union Army doggedly and slowly retire toward\r\nSudley Ford, their rear covered by an irregular square of Infantry,\r\nwhich, mainly by the exertions of Colonel Corcoran, has been formed to\r\nresist a threatened charge of Stuart's Cavalry.\r\n\r\n     [At the rate of \"not more than two, or two and a half, miles an\r\n     hour,\" and not \"helter-skelter,\" as some narrators state.]\r\n\r\nIt is not fear, that has got the better of our Union troops.  It is\r\nphysical exhaustion for one thing; it is thirst for another.  Men must\r\ndrink,--even if they have foolishly thrown away their canteens,--and\r\nmany have retired to get water.  It is the moral effect also--the\r\nterrible disappointment--of seeing what they suppose are Johnston's\r\nfresh troops from the Shenandoah Valley, without Patterson \"on their\r\nheels,\" suddenly appear on their flank and rear.  It is not fear; though\r\nsome of them are panic-stricken, and, as they catch sight of Stuart's\r\nmounted men,--no black horse or uniform among them,--raise the cry of\r\n\"The Black Horse Cavalry!--The Black Horse Cavalry!\"\r\n\r\nThe Union attack has been repulsed, it is true; but the Union soldiers,\r\nthough disorganized, discouraged, and disappointed, are not dismayed.\r\nTheir officers not yet having learned how to fight, and themselves\r\nlacking the cohesion of discipline, the men have lost their regimental\r\norganizations, and owing to the causes mentioned, slowly retire across\r\nSudley Ford of Bull Run, in a condition of disintegration, their retreat\r\nbeing bravely covered by the 27th and 69th New York, (which have rallied\r\nand formed there), Sykes's Infantry battalion, Arnold's Battery, and\r\nPalmer's Cavalry.\r\n\r\n     [In his report to Major Barnard, Capt. D. P.  Woodbury, of the\r\n     corps of Engineers, says: \"It is not for me to give a history of\r\n     the battle.  The Enemy was driven on our left, from cover to cover,\r\n     a mile and a half.  Our position for renewing the action the next\r\n     morning was excellent; whence, then, our failure?  It will not be\r\n     out of place, I hope, for me to give my own opinion of the cause of\r\n     this failure.  An old soldier feels safe in the ranks, unsafe out\r\n     of the ranks, and the greater the danger the more pertinaciously he\r\n     clings to his place.  The volunteer of three months never attains\r\n     this instinct of discipline.  Under danger, and even under mere\r\n     excitement, he flies away from his ranks, and looks for safety in\r\n     dispersion.  At four o'clock in the afternoon of the 21st, there\r\n     were more than twelve thousand volunteers on the battle-field of\r\n     Bull Run, who had entirely lost their regimental organizations.\r\n     They could no longer be handled as troops, for the officers and men\r\n     were not together.  Men and officers mingled together\r\n     promiscuously; and it is worthy of remark that this disorganization\r\n     did not result from defeat or fear, for up to four o'clock we had\r\n     been uniformly successful.  The instinct of discipline, which keeps\r\n     every man in his place, had not been acquired.  We cannot suppose\r\n     that the troops of the Enemy had attained a higher degree of\r\n     discipline than our own, but they acted on the defensive, and were\r\n     not equally exposed to disorganization.\"]\r\n\r\nWhile the divisions of Hunter and Heintzelman, which came down in the\r\nmorning across Sudley Ford, are now, with one brigade (Sherman's) of\r\nTyler's Division, retiring again, in this disordered condition, by that\r\nford; two other brigades of Tyler's Division, viz., that of Schenck\r\n--which, at 4 o'clock, was just in the act of advancing upon, and across,\r\nthe Stone Bridge, to join in the Union attack, and of Keyes, which was,\r\nat the same time, just succeeding in its effort to turn the right flank\r\nof the Enemy's third new line,--are withdrawing from the field, across\r\nBull Run stream, by the Warrenton Pike, and other roads leading them\r\ndirectly toward Centreville.  The brigades of both Keyes and Schenck are\r\nretiring in good order; that of Keyes, at \"an ordinary pace,\" following\r\nclose after McDowell, who, with his staff, has ridden across the\r\nbattlefield and Bull Run; while part of that of Schenck, united with the\r\n2nd Maine (of Keyes' Brigade) and Ayres's Battery, \"promptly and\r\neffectively\" repulses a charge of the Enemy's Cavalry, and covers the\r\nrear of Tyler's Division.  Both of these brigades reach Centreville,\r\nhungry and weary, but otherwise, for the most part, in good shape.\r\n\r\nBut during this grand all-day attack, by two of McDowell's divisions,\r\ndirectly aided by part of a third, upon the left of the Enemy's original\r\nBull Run line of defense--which attack, while it has failed in its\r\npurpose, has also utterly upset and defeated the Enemy's purpose to\r\ncarry out Beauregard's plan of attacking Centreville that same morning\r\n--what has the Left Wing of McDowell's Army been doing?  Let us go back\r\nto Sunday morning, and ascertain:\r\n\r\nAll the Army of McDowell, save his Left Wing--which, comprising the two\r\nbrigades (Blenker's and Davies's) of Miles's Division, and Richardson's\r\nBrigade of Tyler's Division that fought the preliminary battle of\r\nBlackburn's Ford, is now under the command of Miles,--moved away from\r\nCentreville, down the Warrenton Pike, as we have seen, very early in the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nBlenker remains with his brigade as a reserve, on the heights a little\r\nEast of Centreville, to throw up intrenchments; which, however, he does\r\nnot do, for lack of trenching implements.  Richardson and Davies are to\r\nmake a feint, at Blackburn's Ford, so as to draw the Enemy's troops\r\nthere, while the heavy blow of McDowell's Right Wing and Centre falls\r\nupon the left flank and rear of the Enemy's Bull Run line.\r\n\r\nRichardson's Brigade is already down the ridge, in his old position at\r\nBlackburn's Ford, when Davies with his brigade reaches it, from\r\nCentreville, and, by virtue of seniority, takes command of the two\r\nbrigades.  Leaving Richardson's Brigade and Greene's Battery exactly on\r\nthe battle-ground of the 18th July, Davies posts two regiments (the 18th\r\nand 32nd New York) of his own brigade, with Hunt's Battery, on the brow\r\nof a hill, in an open wheat field, some eighty yards to the\r\nSouth-Eastward of Richardson, distant some 1,500 yards from Longstreet's\r\nbatteries on the Western side of Bull Run,--and commences a rapid fire,\r\nupon the Enemy's position at Blackburn's Ford, from both of the Union\r\nbatteries.\r\n\r\nAt 10 o'clock, there is a lull in this Union fire.  The Artillery\r\nammunition is running short.  The demonstration, however, seems, thus\r\nfar, to be successful--judging by the movement of Rebel troops toward\r\nBlackburn's Ford.  The lull continues until 11 o'clock.  At that time\r\nMiles arrives at his front, in a towering rage.\r\n\r\nOn his way down the ridge, that morning, early, Davies had made a\r\ndiscovery.  While passing a roadway, his guide had casually remarked:\r\n\"There is a road that leads around to the Enemy's camp, direct.\"  \"Ah!\"\r\n--said Davies--\"and can they get through that road?\"  \"Oh, yes,\" replied\r\nthe guide.  Davies had at once halted, and, after posting his 16th and\r\n31st New York Regiments, with two guns of Hunt's Battery, near this\r\nroad, at its junction with the ridge road running up to Centreville and\r\nBlack burn's Ford, had proceeded, with the rest of his regiments and\r\nguns, to the position where Miles finds him.\r\n\r\nBut Miles has discovered what Davies has done, in this matter of the\r\nflanking roadway; and--without knowing, or apparently caring to know,\r\nthe reason underlying the posting of the two regiments and two guns in\r\nits vicinity,--flies into \"a terrible passion\" because of it; in \"no\r\nvery measured language,\" gives Davies \"a severe dressing down;\" and\r\norders him to bring both regiments and guns down to the front.  Davies\r\ncomplies, and says nothing.  Miles also orders him to continue the\r\nfiring from his batteries, without regard to the quantity of ammunition.\r\nThis order, also, Davies obeys--and the firing proceeds, for two solid\r\nhours, until another order comes, about 1 o'clock P.M., to stop firing.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, that Miles is not at all himself--but is suffering under\r\nsuch a strain of mental excitement, he afterward claims, that he is not\r\nresponsible.\r\n\r\nMiles, however, returns to Centreville about noon; and no sooner is he\r\ngone, than Davies at once sends back pioneers to obstruct that road\r\nwhich would bring the Enemy around his left flank and rear, to\r\nCentreville.  These, work so industriously, that they cut down a quarter\r\nof a mile of trees, and block the road up completely.  Davies also posts\r\na few pickets there, in case of accidents.  It is well he does so.  It\r\nis not long before the Enemy makes an attempt to get around to his rear,\r\nby that road; but, finding it both obstructed and picketed, retires\r\nagain.  Davies does not see the Rebels making that attempt, but catches\r\nsight of them on their return, and gives them a severe shelling for\r\ntheir pains.\r\n\r\nDavies keeps up his firing, more or less-according to the condition of\r\nthe Enemy and of his own ammunition--until 4 o'clock, when the firing\r\noccasioned by the Union flanking movement, six miles to his right,\r\nceases.  Then there reaches him a note from Richardson, so badly\r\npenciled that he can only make out the one word \"beaten,\"--but cannot,\r\nfor the life of him, make out, whether the beaten one is our Right Wing,\r\nor the Enemy!\r\n\r\nOf what followed, he tells the story himself,--under oath, before the\r\nCommittee on the Conduct of the War--so graphically, that the temptation\r\nto give it, in his own words, is irresistible.  \"I saw unmistakable\r\nevidence,\" said he, \"that we were going to be attacked on our Left Wing.\r\nI got all ready for the attack, but did not change my front.\r\n\r\n\"About 5 o'clock, I think, the Rebels made their appearance back upon\r\nthis very road up which they had gone before; but instead of keeping up\r\nthe road, they turned past a farm-house, went through the farm-yard, and\r\ncame down and formed right in front of me, in a hollow, out of my sight.\r\nWell, I let them all come down there, keeping a watch upon their\r\nmovements.  I told the Artillery not to fire any shot at them until they\r\nsaw the rear column go down, so as to get them all down in the little\r\nhollow or basin, there.  There was a little basin there, probably a\r\nquarter of a mile every way.  I should think that, maybe, 3,000 men\r\nfiled down, before I changed front.\r\n\r\n\"We lay there, with two regiments back, and the Artillery in front,\r\nfacing Bull Run.  As soon as about 3,000 of the Enemy got down in this\r\nbasin, I changed the front of the Artillery around to the left, in face\r\nof the Enemy, and put a company of Infantry between each of the pieces\r\nof Artillery, and then deployed the balance of the regiments right and\r\nleft, and made my line-of-battle.\r\n\r\n\"I gave directions to the Infantry not to fire a shot, under any\r\ncircumstances, until they got the word of command from me.  I\r\nfurthermore said I would shoot the first man that fired a shot before I\r\ngave the command to do so.\r\n\r\n\"I gave them orders all to lie down on their faces.  They, (the Rebels)\r\nwere just over the brow of the hill, so that, if they came up in front\r\nof us, they could not hit a man.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as I saw the rear column, I told * * * Lieutenant Benjamin to\r\nfire.  * * *  He fired the first shot when the rear column presented\r\nitself.  It just went over their heads, and hit a horse and rider in\r\ntheir rear.  As soon as the first shot was fired, I gave the order for\r\nthe whole six pieces of Artillery to open with grape and canister.  The\r\neffect was terrible.  They were all there, right before us, about 450\r\nyards off, and had not suspected that we were going to fire at all,\r\nthough they did not know what the reason was.  Hunt's Battery (belonging\r\nto Richardson--who had by mistake got Greene's) performed so well, that,\r\nin thirty minutes, we dispersed every one of them!\r\n\r\n\"I do not know how many were killed, but we so crippled their entire\r\nforce that they never came after us an inch.  A man, who saw the effect\r\nof the firing, in the valley, said it was just like firing into a wheat\r\nfield; the column gave way at once, before the grape and canister; they\r\nwere just within available distance.  I knew very well that if they but\r\ngot into that basin, the first fire would cut them all to pieces; and it\r\ndid.  We continued to fire for thirty minutes, when there was nothing\r\nmore to fire at, and no more shots were returned.\"\r\n\r\nAt a later hour--while remaining victorious at their well defended\r\nposition, with the Enemy at their front, dispersed and silenced,--these\r\ntwo brigades of the Left Wing, receive orders to fall back on\r\nCentreville, and encamp.  With the brigade of Richardson, and Greene's\r\nBattery in advance, Davies's own brigade and Hunt's Battery following,\r\nthey fall back on the heights of Centreville \"without the least\r\nconfusion and in perfect order\"--reaching them at 7 P.M.\r\n\r\nMeantime Miles has been relieved from command, and McDowell has ordered\r\nBlenker's Brigade to take position a mile or more in advance of\r\nCentreville, toward Bull Run, on both sides of the Warrenton Pike, to\r\nprotect the retreat, now being made, in \"a few collected bodies,\" but\r\nmainly in great disorder--owing partly to the baggage-wagons choking the\r\nroad, along which both venturesome civilians and fagged-out troops are\r\nretreating upon Centreville.  This confused retreat passes through\r\nBlenker's lines until 9 o'clock P.M.--and then, all is secure.\r\n\r\nAt midnight, McDowell has decided to make no stand at Centreville, but\r\nto retire upon the defensive works at Washington.  The order to retreat,\r\nis given, and, with the rear well guarded by Richardson's and Blenker's\r\nBrigades, is carried out, the van of the retreat, with no Enemy\r\npursuing, degenerating finally into a \"mob,\" which carries more or less\r\npanic into Washington itself, as well as terrible disappointment and\r\nchagrin to all the Loyal States of the Union.\r\n\r\nKnowing what we now do, concerning the Battle of Bull Run, it is\r\nsomewhat surprising, at this day, to read the dispatches sent by\r\nMcDowell to General Scott's headquarters at Washington, immediately\r\nafter it.  They are in these words:\r\n\r\n               \"CENTREVILLE, July 21, 1861--5:45 P.M.\r\n\r\n\"We passed Bull Run, engaged the Enemy, who, it seems, had just been\r\nre-enforced by General Johnston.  We drove them for several hours, and\r\nfinally routed them.\"\r\n\r\n     [\"No one who did not share in the sad experience will be able to\r\n     realize the consternation which the news of this discomfiture\r\n     --grossly exaggerated--diffused over the loyal portion of our\r\n     Country.  Only the tidings which had reached Washington up to four\r\n     o'clock--all presaging certain and decisive victory--were permitted\r\n     to go North by telegraph that day and evening; so that, on Monday\r\n     morning, when the crowd of fugitives from our grand Army was\r\n     pouring into Washington, a heedless, harmless, worthless mob, the\r\n     Loyal States were exulting over accounts of a decisive triumph.\r\n     But a few hours brought different advices; and these were as much\r\n     worse than the truth as the former had been better: our Army had\r\n     been utterly destroyed-cut to pieces, with a loss of twenty-five to\r\n     thirty thousand men, besides all its artillery and munitions, and\r\n     Washington lay at the mercy of the Enemy, who were soon to advance\r\n     to the capture and sack of our great commercial cities.  Never\r\n     before had so black a day as that black Monday lowered upon the\r\n     loyal hearts of the North; and the leaden, weeping skies reflected\r\n     and heightened, while they seemed to sympathize with, the general\r\n     gloom.  It would have been easy, with ordinary effort and care, to\r\n     have gathered and remanded to their camps or forts around\r\n     Alexandria or Arlington, all the wretched stragglers to whom fear\r\n     had lent wings, and who, throwing away their arms and equipments,\r\n     and abandoning all semblance of Military order or discipline, had\r\n     rushed to the Capital to hide therein their shame, behind a cloud\r\n     of exaggerations and falsehoods.  The still effective batteries,\r\n     the solid battalions, that were then wending their way slowly back\r\n     to their old encampments along the South bank of the Potomac,\r\n     depressed but unshaken, dauntless and utterly unassailed, were\r\n     unseen and unheard from; while the panic-stricken racers filled and\r\n     distended the general ear with their tales of impregnable\r\n     intrenchments and masked batteries, of regiments slaughtered,\r\n     brigades utterly cut to pieces, etc., making out their miserable\r\n     selves to be about all that was left of the Army.  That these men\r\n     were allowed thus to straggle into Washington, instead of being\r\n     peremptorily stopped at the bridges and sent back to the\r\n     encampments of their several regiments, is only to be accounted for\r\n     on the hypothesis that the reason of our Military magnates had been\r\n     temporarily dethroned, so as to divest them of all moral\r\n     responsibility,\" Greeley's Am. Conflict, pp.  552-53., vol. I.]\r\n\r\n\"They rallied and repulsed us, but only to give us again the victory,\r\nwhich seemed complete.  But our men, exhausted with fatigue and thirst,\r\nand confused by firing into each other, were attacked by the Enemy's\r\nreserves, and driven from the position we had gained, overlooking\r\nManassas.  After this, the men could not be rallied, but slowly left the\r\nfield.  In the meantime the Enemy outflanked Richardson at Blackburn's\r\nFord, and we have now to hold Centreville till our men can get behind\r\nit.  Miles's Division is holding the town.  It is reported that Colonel\r\nCameron is killed, Hunter and Heintzelman wounded, neither dangerously.\r\n                         \"IRWIN MCDOWELL,\r\n                    \"Brigadier-General, Commanding.\r\n\r\n\"Lieutenant-Colonel TOWNSEND.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \"FAIRFAX COURT HOUSE, July 21, 1861.\r\n\r\n\"The men having thrown away their haversacks in the battle, and left\r\nthem behind, they are without food; have eaten nothing since breakfast.\r\nWe are without artillery ammunition.  The larger part of the men are a\r\nconfused mob, entirely demoralized.  It was the opinion of all the\r\ncommanders that no stand could be made this side of the Potomac.  We\r\nwill, however, make the attempt at Fairfax Court House.  From a prisoner\r\nwe learn that 20,000 from Johnston joined last night, and they march on\r\nus to-night.\r\n                              \"IRWIN MCDOWELL.\r\n\r\n\"Colonel TOWNSEND\"\r\n\r\n\r\n               \"FAIRFAX COURT HOUSE, [July] 22, 1861.\r\n\r\n\"Many of the volunteers did not wait for authority to proceed to the\r\nPotomac, but left on their own decision.  They are now pouring through\r\nthis place in a state of utter disorganization.  They could not be\r\nprepared for action by to-morrow morning even were they willing.  I\r\nlearn from prisoners that we are to be pressed here to-night and\r\ntomorrow morning, as the Enemy's force is very large, and they are\r\nelated.  I think we heard cannon on our rear-guard.  I think now, as all\r\nof my commanders thought at Centreville, there is no alternative but to\r\nfall back to the Potomac, and I shall proceed to do so with as much\r\nregularity as possible.\r\n                                   \"IRWIN MCDOWELL.\r\n\r\n\"Colonel TOWNSEND.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \"ARLINGTON, July 22, 1861.\r\n\r\n\"I avail myself of the re-establishing of telegraph to report my\r\narrival.  When I left the forks of the Little River turnpike and\r\nColumbia turnpike, where I had been for a couple of hours turning\r\nstragglers and parties of regiments upon this place and Alexandria, I\r\nreceived intelligence that the rear-guard, under Colonel Richardson, had\r\nleft Fairfax Court House, and was getting along well.  Had not been\r\nattacked.  I am now trying to get matters a little organized over here.\r\n                         \"IRWIN MCDOWELL.\r\n                         \"Brigadier-General.\r\n\"E. D. TOWNSEND.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMcDowell had unquestionably been repulsed, in his main attack, with his\r\nRight Wing, and much of his Army was badly demoralized; but, on the\r\nother hand, it may be well to repeat that the Enemy's plan of attack\r\nthat same morning had been frustrated, and most of his forces so badly\r\nshattered and demoralized that he dared not follow up the advantage\r\nwhich, more by our own blunders than by his prowess, he had gained.\r\n\r\nIf the Union forces--or at least the Right Wing of them--were whipped,\r\nthe Enemy also was whipped.  Jackson himself confesses that while he\r\nhad, at the last moment, broken our centre, our forces had turned both\r\nof his flanks.  The Enemy was, in fact, so badly used up, that he not\r\nonly dared not pursue us to Washington--as he would have down had he\r\nbeen able--but he was absolutely afraid McDowell would resume the\r\nattack, on the right of the original Bull Run line, that very night!\r\nFor, in a letter to General Beauregard; dated Richmond, Virginia, August\r\n4, 1861, Jefferson Davis,--who was on the ground at Bull Run, July\r\n21st,--alluding to the Battle of Bull Run, and Beauregard's excuses for\r\nnot pursuing the Union troops, says:\r\n\r\n\"I think you are unjust to yourself in putting your failure to pursue\r\nthe Enemy to Washington, to the account of short supplies of subsistence\r\nand transportation.  Under the circumstances of our Army, and in the\r\nabsence of the knowledge since acquired--if, indeed, the statements be\r\ntrue--it would have been extremely hazardous to have done more than was\r\nperformed.  You will not fail to remember that, so far from knowing that\r\nthe Enemy was routed, a large part of our forces was moved by you, in\r\nthe night of the 21st, to repel a supposed attack upon our right, and\r\nthe next day's operations did not fully reveal what has since been\r\nreported of the Enemy's panic.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Jefferson Davis's statement is corroborated by the Report of Colonel\r\nWithers, of the 18th Virginia, who, after starting with other regiments,\r\nin an attempt to cut off the Union retreat, was recalled to the Stone\r\nBridge,--and who says: \"Before reaching the point we designed to occupy\r\n(near the Stone Bridge) we were met by another order to march\r\nimmediately to Manassas Junction, as an attack was apprehended that\r\nnight.  Although it was now after sunset, and my men had had no food all\r\nday, when the command to march to Manassas was given, they cheerfully\r\ntook the route to that place.\"\r\n\r\nColonel Davies, who, as we have seen, commanded McDowell's stubborn Left\r\nWing, was after all, not far wrong, when, in his testimony before the\r\nCommittee on the Conduct of the War, he declared, touching the story of\r\nthe Bull Run Battle: \"It ought to have read that we were victorious with\r\nthe 13,000 troops of the Left Wing, and defeated in the 18,000 of the\r\nRight Wing.  That is all that Bull Run amounts to.\"\r\n\r\nIn point of fact, the Battle of Bull Run--the first pitched battle of\r\nthe War--was a drawn battle.\r\n\r\nWar was now fully inaugurated--Civil War--a stupendous War between two\r\ngreat Sections of one common Country; those of our People, on the one\r\nside, fighting for the dissolution of the Union--and incidentally for\r\nFree Trade, and for Slavery; those on the other side, fighting for the\r\npreservation of the Union--and incidentally for Protection to our Free\r\nIndustries, and for the Freedom of the Slave.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Republican Party controlled both Houses of Congress it\r\nprovided Protection to our Free Industries, and to the Free Labor\r\nengaged in them, by the Morill Tariff Act of 1860--the foundation Act of\r\nall subsequent enactments on the subject.  In subsequent pages of this\r\nwork we shall see how the Freedom of the Slave was also accomplished by\r\nthe same great Party.",
