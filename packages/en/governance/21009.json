XVII.--FEBRUARY, 1866--NO. C.\r\n\r\n\r\nEntered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1866, by TICKNOR AND\r\nFIELDS, in the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the District of\r\nMassachusetts.\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Note: Minor typos have been corrected and footnotes moved\r\nto the end of the article.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENGLISH OPINION ON THE AMERICAN WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great events which took place in the United States between the first\r\nelection of President Lincoln and the accession of President Johnson\r\nexcited an amount of party-spirit in England greater than I recollect in\r\nconnection with any other non-English occurrences, and fairly\r\nproportionate even to that supreme form of party-spirit which the same\r\nevents produced in the States themselves,--the party-spirit which, in\r\nhostile and closing ranks, clenches teeth and sets life at nought,\r\nseeing no alternative, no possibility, save this one only, to carry its\r\npoint or die. \"I am a Northerner,\" and \"I am a Southerner,\" were, during\r\nthe war, phrases as common on Englishmen's lips as \"I am a Liberal\" or\r\n\"a Conservative,\" \"I am a Protectionist\" (this, indeed, has about become\r\nobsolete) or \"a Free-Trader.\" It would be very far from correct to say\r\nthat this party-spirit has yet subsided in England; highly important\r\nquestions, personal and political, remain in ample abundance to keep it\r\nlively; but we have at any rate reached a point at which one may try to\r\ndiscuss the past phases of our partisanship, not in the temper of a\r\npartisan. My endeavor in the following pages will be to do this,--very\r\nimperfectly, beyond a doubt, but, as far as it goes, candidly and\r\nwithout disguise.\r\n\r\nThe writer must in the first instance, in order that his remarks may be\r\naccurately judged by the reader, essay to define his own position and\r\nthe sphere within which his observations extend. He is a born and bred\r\nEnglishman and Londoner, of parentage partly Italian. His professional\r\nemployment is that of a Government clerk, of fair average standing; he\r\nis also occupied a good deal in writing for publication, chiefly upon\r\nsubjects of fine art. His circle of personal intimacy and\r\nacquaintanceship is mainly made up of artists and literary men,\r\nincluding especially several of those who have made themselves most\r\nprominent in these classes within the last twenty years; and this\r\nacquaintanceship shades naturally off, in a minor and moderate degree,\r\ninto those circles of good social standing which are rather liberally\r\nreceptive than productive of literature and art. The writer cannot\r\nprofess or affect to be \"behind the scenes\" of political parties, or to\r\nhave dived into the minds of the peerage over their wine or of artisans\r\nin their workshops. He has conversed freely with many persons of culture\r\nand many fair representatives of the average British middle classes, and\r\nhas read, in a less or more miscellaneous way, a good many opinions and\r\nstatements, in books and newspapers, on both sides of the question. His\r\nown opinions are not strictly to the point, but may as well be stated at\r\nonce, so that the reader, if he finds or fancies a bias in the views to\r\nbe expressed in the sequel, may know to what to attribute it.\r\n\r\nFrom the first symptoms of Secession to the surrender of the last\r\nSouthern army, the writer has felt a vivid interest in the great\r\nstruggle and its issues, and a thorough sympathy with the cause of the\r\nNorth and alienation from that of the South,--points on which he might,\r\nperhaps, be more inclined to dilate, were it not, that, at this late\r\nhour of the day, Northern adherency might read like the mere worship of\r\nsuccess. So it is now, but so it was not, in many circles of English\r\nsociety at least, during the continuance of the war. Almost up to the\r\nvery fall of Richmond, to express a decisive adherence to the Northern\r\ncause was often to be singular and solitary in a roomful of company; the\r\ntimorous adherent would be minded to keep silence, and the outspoken one\r\nwould be prepared for a stare and an embarrassed pause to ensue upon his\r\navowal. At the same time that all his sympathies and hopes were for the\r\nNorth, the writer entertained opinions which forbade him to condemn the\r\nSouth, so far as the mere fact of secession and armed insurrection was\r\nconcerned. To take a wide view of the question, he apprehends, that, in\r\nevery fully constituted community, there are two coextensive and\r\ncountervailing rights: the right of the existent _de facto_ government\r\nto maintain itself by all legal and honorable means, and, if requisite,\r\nby the arbitrament of the sword; and the right of any section of the\r\ncommunity to reorganize itself as it may see fit for its own interests,\r\nand to establish its independence by force of arms, should nothing else\r\nserve,--the \"sacred right of insurrection.\" The insurgent party is not\r\nto be decried for the mere act of resistance, nor the loyal and\r\ngovernmental party for the mere act of self-conservation and repression\r\nof its opponents; each stands the hazard of the die, and commits its\r\ncause to a supreme trial of strength. If the American colonies of Great\r\nBritain were not to be blamed for the mere act of resisting the\r\nconstituted authorities, if the English Parliamentarians, the French\r\nRevolution, the Polish Insurrection, the Italian Wars of Independence,\r\nwere justifiable,--and the writer thoroughly believes that they all were\r\nso,--he fails to see that the Southern States of the American Union were\r\nnecessarily in the wrong simply because they revolted from the Federal\r\nauthority. And in each case he recognizes the coextensive right, so far\r\nas that alone is concerned, of the existing government to assert itself,\r\nand stem the tide of revolt. It is the old question of the Rights of Man\r\nand the Mights of Man, concerning which Carlyle has had so much to say.\r\nA trial between the Mights often throws considerable light upon the\r\nquestion of the Rights; and, until at any rate the true Might has been\r\nascertained by this crucial test, one may without half-heartedness admit\r\nthat both of the opposing Rights, the conservative and the disruptive,\r\nare genuine rights, mutually antagonistic and internecine, but neither\r\ndisproved by the other.\r\n\r\nBut this is only the most rudimentary view of the matter. An abstract\r\nand indefeasible right of insurrection may exist, maintainable in any\r\nand every case; and yet a particular instance of insurrection maybe\r\nfoolish, wicked, and altogether worthy of ruin and extinction. And the\r\nwriter believes that he is perfectly consistent with himself in thinking\r\nboth that the abstract right of insurrection existed in the case of the\r\nSouthern States of the Union and the abstract right of repression in the\r\nFederal Government, and also that this particular insurrection deserved\r\ncondemnation and failure, and this particular repression deserved\r\ncredit and triumph,--a triumph which, when the \"Mights of Men\" had been\r\nsufficiently tested, it very arduously and very conclusively managed to\r\nachieve.\r\n\r\nAs to the question of a _legal and constitutional_ right of secession,\r\nthe writer has not the impudence to express--and scarcely to\r\nentertain--an opinion. That is a question for American lawyers and\r\npublicists to discuss and determine; the obfuscated British mind being\r\nentitled to affirm only this: that there seems to have been something to\r\nsay on the Southern side of the question, as well as a good deal on the\r\nNorthern. The writer apprehends that the abstract right of insurrection\r\non the one hand, and of self-conservation on the other, quite overbears,\r\nin so vast and momentous a debate, the narrow, technical, legal\r\nquestion: that which it does not overbear is the rightness or wrongness\r\nof the immediate motive, conduct, and aim of any particular insurrection\r\nand repression, considered individually. The abstract rights remain the\r\nsame in all cases; the application of those rights differs immeasurably,\r\naccording to the merits of each several case.\r\n\r\nWhat were the merits of this particular case? The constitutional\r\nmajority of the whole nation had elected a President whose election was\r\nheld by both parties to be tantamount to the policy of non-extension of\r\nslavery into the Territories of the Republic, and into all States to be\r\nthereafter constructed; and before the President elect had entered upon\r\nhis functions, before a single subsisting legal right (which might or\r\nmight not be a moral wrong) had been interfered with, while there was\r\nyet no ground for affirming that any such right would ever be interfered\r\nwith, the Southern States declared that their minority was of more\r\nweight than the nation's majority, that they would break up the nation\r\nrather than abide by its award, and would themselves constitute a new\r\nnation, founded on the maintenance of slavery within their own borders,\r\nand its extension and propagation as opportunity might offer. This, and\r\nnot the mere fact that they were secessionists, insurgents, rebels, or\r\nwhatever harder term may be forthcoming, is the reason why the writer\r\ndisliked the revolt of the Southern States, and wished it to come to\r\nnought; and corresponding facts regarding the Northern States,--that\r\nthey were simply upholding a constitutional act performed by the nation\r\nat large, were contending for the majestic present and the magnificent\r\nfuture of a great and free republic, were arrayed against the extension\r\nof slavery, and might, by the force of circumstances and the growth of\r\nideas, find themselves called up even to exterminate the existing\r\nslave-system,--these were the facts which commanded his homage to the\r\nNorthern cause,--not merely that they were the assertors of authority\r\nagainst innovation. The case, as the writer understands it, amounts\r\nsimply to this: that the South seceded before it had been in any degree\r\ndamnified, and to maintain a system the scotching or killing of which,\r\nthough not in fact then contemplated by the North to any extent contrary\r\nto existing laws, would have been a benefit to mankind and an atonement\r\nto human conscience. It may perhaps seem superfluous or impertinent to\r\nhave given so many words to the statement of opinions so simple and\r\nobvious. But the English Liberal adherents of the Northern States were\r\ncontinually twitted with their assumed inconsistency in censuring the\r\ninsurrection of the South, while they approved of (for instance) the\r\ninsurrection of Lombardy against the Austrians; and it seemed impossible\r\nto get the objectors to understand, or at any rate to acknowledge, that\r\nmotives, aims, and consequences have some bearing upon revolts, as upon\r\nother transactions, and that one may consistently abhor a revolt the\r\nmotive and aim of which he believes to be bad, while he sympathizes with\r\nanother the motive and aim of which he believes to be good. Of course,\r\ntoo, there were other objectors who denied, and will to this day not\r\nblush to deny, that the question of Slavery was the real substantial\r\nincentive to secession, and who paraded the minor questions of tariffs,\r\nthe conflicting interests of the productive and the manufacturing\r\nStates, and the like. These arguments the writer leaves unfingered; it\r\nis no business of his to fray their delicate texture. All he has to say\r\nof them here is, that, as he does not value them at a pin's fee as\r\nrepresenting the main point at issue, they in no way affected the\r\nfeelings which he entertained concerning the war. Again, there were\r\nremonstrants of a still more impracticable frame of mind, who could see\r\nthe right, absolute or potential, of any despotic or constitutional\r\nmonarchy, or any conquering power, to suppress secession and revolt, but\r\ncould not conceive that any similar right pertained to the central\r\ngovernment of a federative republic. To hear them, the will of a\r\nnational majority was of no account in a national issue, provided the\r\nmajority of any particular State of the federation took the contrary\r\nside. The national majority had no rights such as the strong arm of the\r\nlaw, or the armed force, ought to impose upon gainsayers; it was only\r\nthe national minority which had such rights. The latter might break up\r\nthe nation; the former must not enforce any veto upon the disruption.\r\nWhy elect a President as your governmental chief, if you mean that\r\ngovernment should be a reality? Why not be respectable, like us\r\nEuropeans, and have a King at once? Such, briefly interpreted, appears\r\nto have been the quintessence of the wisdom of these political sages.\r\n\r\nThe writer has now done with the exposition of his own views,--of no\r\nconsequence assuredly to his American readers, save for the clearer\r\nunderstanding of what he has to say concerning the views entertained by\r\nhis British countryman at large. He has also done with the few specimens\r\nwhich it fell in his way to cite of objections urged against his\r\ncolleagues in opinion, and which he was obtuse enough to imagine to be\r\nno objections at all. He proceeds to his main subject,--the varieties of\r\nEnglish opinion on the American War.\r\n\r\nThese varieties may perhaps, with some approach to completeness, be\r\ndefined under the following seven heads.\r\n\r\n1st. The party which believed in the sincerity, the right, and the\r\nprobable eventual success of the North.\r\n\r\n2d. That which believed in the right of the North, but which doubted or\r\ndisbelieved its sincerity, especially on the question of Slavery, or its\r\neventual success, or both.\r\n\r\n3d. That which cared only for the anti-slavery aspect of the contest.\r\n\r\n4th. That which believed in the right and the probable eventual success\r\nof the South.\r\n\r\n5th. That which believed in the right of the South, but which doubted or\r\ndisbelieved its eventual success.\r\n\r\n6th. That which, contrariwise, believed in the eventual success of the\r\nSouth, but doubted or disbelieved its right.\r\n\r\n7th. That which covertly or avowedly justified slavery.\r\n\r\nTo each of these parties a few words of comment must be given.\r\n\r\n1st. The party which believed in the sincerity, the right, and the\r\nprobable eventual success of the North was, I think, extremely small\r\nduring the greater part of the war,--say, between the first Battle of\r\nBull Run and the capture of Atlanta. By sincerity I mean such points as\r\nthese: that the Federal Government was honestly desirous of fulfilling\r\nits obligations towards the South; that the North, having to maintain\r\nthe integrity of the country by force of arms, was ready to make all\r\nneedful sacrifices for that object, and to lavish its blood and\r\ntreasure; above all, that the professions of dislike to slavery, the\r\noffer of military emancipation to negroes, and, finally, the efforts to\r\namend the Constitution so as to abolish slavery, root and branch, were\r\nsincere. Many, of course, believed in the right of the North, and in one\r\nof other of these items of sincerity; few, I think, in the right, in the\r\nsincerity throughout, and in the success as well. The delusion, that\r\nthe North, after using up its Irish and German population and its\r\nincoming immigrants, would quail before the necessity of hazarding also\r\na large proportion of its own settled Anglo-Saxon population, was\r\nextremely prevalent. Equally prevalent the notion that the North was\r\nfighting merely for a constitutional idea, or for national integrity,\r\npredominance, or (as Lord Russell phrased it) \"for empire,\" without any\r\nreal regard for the interests of the negro. And when all these demands\r\nupon one's faith had to be supplemented by a belief in the probable\r\nsuccess of the North, few persons seemingly ventured to commit\r\nthemselves to the whole of the proposition. Within my own personal\r\ncircle of observation, I could name but one, or, at the utmost, two,\r\nbesides myself, who, in the main, with some variations according to the\r\nchanging current of events, clung to the cause of the North in its\r\nentirety. The first of these two persons is a painter of great\r\ndistinction and a man, in other respects, of very thinking and serious\r\nmind, well known by name, and partially by his works, to such Americans\r\nas take an interest in fine art. The second of the two is one of our\r\nvery greatest living poets.--As to the question of success, the\r\nfollowing may perhaps be a tolerably fair account of the varying\r\nimpressions of many, who, along with myself, hoped for the triumph of\r\nthe North, and were disposed, though not with any overwhelming\r\nconfidence, to believe in it. Up to the first Battle of Bull Run,\r\nopinion was suspended or fluctuating; but in the main one's sympathies\r\nconspired with one's information as to the comparative resources of the\r\nopponents to produce a considerable degree of confidence. That battle\r\nand some other Southern successes acted as a severe check; and\r\ndiscouragement prevailed up to the time when the capture of New Orleans,\r\nGrant's advance on the line of the Mississippi, and McClellan's \"On to\r\nRichmond\" march righted the balance. Great uncertainty, however, was\r\nstill felt; and I should say that afterwards, between the repulse of\r\nMcClellan and Pope and the Battle of Gettysburg, most of the adherents\r\nof the North were consciously \"hoping against hope,\" and, especially at\r\nthe time of the defeat at Chancellorsville and the Northern invasion by\r\nLee in 1863, were almost ready to confess the case desperate.[A]\r\nGettysburg, Vicksburg, and Port Hudson altered the face of affairs, and\r\nrevived a confidence which gradually strengthened almost into a\r\nconviction, such as not all the vast difficulties which afterwards beset\r\nGrant in his advance towards Richmond, nor all the nonsense of the Times\r\nand other Southern journals about \"Johnston continuing to draw Sherman\r\nfrom his base,\" or Hood cutting him off from his communications, and\r\ncompelling him to retreat by that most singular of retreating processes,\r\nthe triumphal march through Georgia from end to end, could ever avail\r\nsubstantially to becloud. Soon after the victory at Gettysburg, those\r\nwho were not blinded by their wishes or preconceptions saw ground for\r\nthinking that the South had made its greatest efforts, and failed,--the\r\nNorth sustained its worst rebuffs, and surmounted them.\r\n\r\n2d. The party which believed in the right of the North, but which\r\ndoubted or disbelieved its sincerity, especially on the question of\r\nSlavery, or its eventual success, or both, was of necessity very\r\nlarge,--including, as it did, in a general way, all the Northern\r\npartisans whose strength and fulness of conviction were not great enough\r\nto enroll them in my first division. It is extremely difficult to form\r\nan opinion, or even a guess, on the question of relative numbers; but I\r\nhave always fancied, that, could the whole nation have been polled on\r\nthe subject, the number of Northern well-wishers would have been found\r\nsensibly to exceed that of the Southern. Generally, men of very grave,\r\nreflective, and unprejudiced minds, students in the philosophy of\r\nsociety and history, men known for their lofty ideal of liberty or of\r\nculture, appeared to be on the side of the North; and the calm,\r\nunfaltering attitude, free from petulance and invective, of those\r\noperative classes in Lancashire, whom the war ruined for a while, has\r\noften been pointed to as showing that the more informed and intelligent\r\nworkingmen were also for the North. They endured a great calamity\r\nwithout murmuring, because they thought the cause just which had\r\nentailed that calamity upon them. Assuming this to be correct, as I\r\nbelieve it to be, the question remains, What was the opinion (or perhaps\r\none should rather say the sentiment) of the class below this,--the great\r\nnumerical bulk of the population, who would take sides according as\r\ntheir sympathies, imaginations, prejudices, or traditional conceptions\r\nof the right might be roused, irrespectively in the main of reasoning as\r\nto any antecedents or consequences? I incline to suppose that the most\r\npowerful impulsion to the feelings of this class must have been that\r\nstrong anti-slavery sentiment which had undoubtedly for many years been\r\nbone of the bone of Englishmen,--more powerful even than that sympathy\r\nfor an overmatched struggle on behalf of independence which would have\r\npleaded for the South. If this is a correct view, it may be inferred\r\nthat the majority of the poorer classes was for the North; as they,\r\nwithout refining over the question, would regard the contest as one\r\nbetween Slavery and Anti-slavery, the latter represented by the North\r\nand the former by the South. Short, however, of some decided majority\r\nfor the North in these classes, whose views do not transpire much upon\r\nthe surface of English opinion, I fear the majority of the whole nation\r\nwould have been found to be with the South; and could I take my own\r\nsphere of society as the criterion, I should be compelled to say that so\r\nit was in overwhelming preponderance. A more diffused connection with\r\nAmerica, through the emigration movement, and through community of\r\ninterest and feeling with a democratic nation, may have combined with a\r\ntruer instinct of right in the popular heart to rectify the balance; and\r\nin default of evidence to the contrary, I am fain to suppose it did.--A\r\nfew words must be added as to one branch of our immediate subject,--the\r\ndoubt or disbelief of the sincerity of the North on the question of\r\nSlavery. Had no prejudice or perversity of argument been imported into\r\nthe subject, it would, I imagine, have been apparent to most of my\r\ncountrymen that the dominant party at the North was genuinely\r\nantagonistic to slavery; that, as long as the South did not violate the\r\nFederal Constitution, the North was trammelled from interfering with\r\nslavery as already established by law in certain States; that the duty\r\nimmediately imposed upon the North and the Government by the act of\r\nSecession was one and undivided,--the maintenance of the Constitution\r\nand of the Union; but that, in proportion to the obstinacy of Southern\r\nresistance, the antagonism to slavery would obtain free play in the\r\nNorth, the slavery question would assume greater and greater prominence\r\nas the _nexus_ of the whole debate, and those who had at first been\r\nbound to make a stand for an extant Union and compromise would be\r\nimpelled and more than willing to fight on for reunion and abolition.\r\nBut this view of the matter was consistently distorted. The\r\nconstitutionalism and nationalism of the North figured in argument as\r\nindifference to slavery, the steps taken towards, the emancipation of\r\nslaves as mere hypocritical stratagems of war, and the climax of\r\ndisingenuousness was reached when the anti-conscription and anti-negro\r\nriots of New York were fastened upon that very war-party against which\r\nthey had been levelled. Systematic misrepresentations of this nature,\r\ninvidious glosses and plausible misconstructions, did undoubtedly\r\nconspire with the really complicated conditions of the case and the\r\nundisputed fact of certain antipathies of race (predicable as truly of\r\nthe Northern States as of any other part of the world) to persuade very\r\nmany Englishmen that the North was not sincerely hostile to slavery, but\r\nused the Anti-slavery or the Abolition cry as a mere feint to disguise\r\nthe lust of domination. Those who liked to be persuaded of this were\r\npersuaded with the utmost ease; and even among men who considered the\r\nsubject without bias, many were confused and shaken.\r\n\r\n3d. The party which cared only for the anti-slavery aspect of the\r\ncontest was large. Their attitude is to a certain extent indicated in\r\nwhat has just been said. One and not an insignificant section of them\r\nwould have sided frankly with the North, if satisfied that the Northern\r\ntriumph would be an anti-slavery triumph; but, talked as they were, or\r\ntalking themselves, into the belief that slavery had little more to fear\r\nfrom the North than the South, they remained, at least during the\r\nearlier part of the war, indifferent or indignant. Others, of course the\r\ngreat majority, watched eagerly every symptom and every step which\r\nproved the North to be in earnest in the work of abolition; they\r\nthrilled to the sounds which \"proclaimed liberty to the captive,\"--the\r\ntones of Northern manifestoes and legislation, the tread of Northern\r\nlegions, and the volleys fired by negro soldiers. They got to feel a\r\ngenuine veneration and even enthusiasm for President Lincoln, and formed\r\nprobably the only section of men or women in this country who could\r\nspeak of General Butler without bringing \"railing accusations.\" The\r\nparty was diffused over the length and breadth of the land. It numbered,\r\nI suppose, some adherents even in the aristocratic and governing\r\nclasses,--thousands, no doubt, among the working and laboring millions;\r\nbut its central strength was in that backbone of English philanthropic\r\neffort, the more plebeian section of the well-to-do middle class,--that\r\nsection which gravitates towards Dissent, in religion, towards\r\nRadicalism in politics, towards Bible Societies, Temperance Movements,\r\n\"Bands of Hope,\" and Exeter Hall. If this section of the British\r\ncommunity had not remained true to anti-slavery ideas, the country would\r\nindeed have been turned \"the seamy side without.\" That we were spared,\r\nin the severer crises of the war, the last uglinesses of tergiversation,\r\nis owing mainly to people of this class, the cheapest subjects for\r\nwell-bred sneers and intellectual superiority in ordinary times.\r\n\r\n4th. The party which believed in the right and the probable eventual\r\nsuccess of the South was obviously, during the greater part of the war,\r\na numerous one. In the earlier stages of Secession, when the chief\r\nquestion before one's thoughts was that of right, I think that\r\ncomparatively few people sided with the South, though very many were\r\nlukewarm or frigid, or actually inimical towards the North. At that time\r\nparty-spirit still respected the old-fashioned notions, that a\r\nself-governing nation must be ruled by its own majority, not minority;\r\nthat a minority which cried out before it was hurt, and \"cut the\r\nconnection\" rather than the balance in its own favor, was likely to be a\r\nfactious and misguided minority; and that a new commonwealth, whose\r\n_raison d'etre_ was Slavery, had little claim to the sympathies of\r\nEnglishmen or of civilization. Others laid greater stress from the first\r\non the argument, that the States of the Union were all sovereign states,\r\nwhich had respectively entered into a voluntary bond, and could\r\nvoluntarily withdraw from it without gainsaying; and that this ground of\r\nright on the side of the South remained unaffected by any accessory\r\nconsiderations. This view rapidly gained over the willing convictions of\r\nSouthern sympathizers, when the impulse and determination, the courage\r\nand early successes of the South, had once roused strong feelings in its\r\nfavor. The earlier argumentative view as to majorities and minorities,\r\nand the fundamental basis of all governments, sank into desuetude, while\r\nthe right of a compact community to independent self-government at its\r\nown option occupied the field of vision. Vast numbers of people--I\r\nshould think, during the greater part of the war, four fifths of the\r\nwhole country--believed in the success of the South; considering it\r\nimpossible that so determined a community, with so vast a territory,\r\nshould ever be coerced into reunion, and not being prepared for an equal\r\namount of determination on the part of the Northern Government and\r\npeople, or for their capacity, even had the will been admitted, to meet\r\nthe required outlay in money and men. Another question, too, was\r\nprominent in men's minds, and indisposed them to contemplating a\r\nsubjugated South. They would ask, \"What is to be done with the South, on\r\nthe unlikely supposition of its being conquered? Is it to become an\r\nAmerican Poland?\" All these considerations inclined the great majority\r\nof the nation to believe that the South would succeed; and, of those who\r\nso believed, a large proportion held the Southerners to be in the right,\r\nor sympathized with them to a degree which obscured the strict question\r\nof right in favor of preference.\r\n\r\n5th. The party which believed in the right of the South, but which\r\ndoubted or disbelieved its eventual success, appears to me to have been\r\nmost inconsiderable up to the final stages of the war. I doubt whether I\r\never met two men, prior, let me say, to Sherman's march through Georgia,\r\nwho would distinctly limit themselves to this: \"I wish the South might\r\nsucceed, but I don't think it will.\" When the impending catastrophe of\r\nthe South was no longer disputable, the Saturday Review, the idol of our\r\nClub-men and University-men, of those who are at once highly cultivated\r\nand intensely English, and who fancy themselves freer from prejudice and\r\nmore large-minded than others in proportion to their incapacity to\r\nperceive that their own prejudices _are_ prejudices,--a paper which had\r\n\"gone in for\" the South with a vehemence only balanced by its virulence\r\nagainst the North,--found it convenient to turn tail, and retort upon\r\nthose opponents with whom the laugh remained at last. The Saturday\r\nReview bleated pitifully, yet unconfessingly, to this effect:--\"True it\r\nis that we have been backing up the South all the while; but we meant no\r\nmore by it than the backer of any prize-fighter or any race-horse means,\r\nwhen he has made his choice, and staked his money, and shouts to adopted\r\ncompetitor, 'Go in and win!' That backer does not necessarily believe\r\nthat his side _will_ be the winner, but only signalizes that that side\r\nis his.\" The evasion came too late; persons who had inconvenient\r\nmemories saw through the shuffling of a pseudo-prophet, who only managed\r\nto cast a retrospective gleam of insincerity over his fortune-telling,\r\nto convert blunder into bad faith, and to stultify his present along\r\nwith his past position. The leek had to be eaten at last: why, after so\r\nmany \"prave 'ords\" of superiority and defiance, confess that the eating\r\nof it had been more than half foreseen all along?\r\n\r\n6th. The party which believed in the eventual success of the South, but\r\ndoubted or disbelieved its right, must have been pretty considerable, if\r\nmy previous estimates are true; for I have already advanced the\r\nconjecture that more than half the nation sided with the North, while\r\nfour fifths believed for a long time in the success of the South. This\r\nfact alone, if correctly alleged, furnishes tolerable evidence of the\r\npersistency and influence of pro-Southern papers and partisans, and\r\ntheir ingenuity in so misreading the facts,\r\n\r\n    \"Che il no e il si nel capo ci tenzona.\"\r\n\r\nThe event has proved that the chances of success were really very much\r\non the side of the North. The superiority in material resources, and\r\ncertain solid and undeniable successes obtained at and early stage of\r\nthe war, such as the capture of New Orleans, were known to be on the\r\nsame side. Slighter grounds would in most cases have sufficed to\r\npersuade minds predisposed by sympathy that this side would win; yet the\r\nSouthern advocates shuffled and played the cards well enough to induce\r\nan opposite conclusion in numerous instances. And no doubt many who\r\nbegan by simply believing that the South would succeed went on to think\r\nthat the North deserved to lose,--partly because, upon such an\r\nassumption, the personal superiority must have been very largely with\r\nthe South, and partly because a combatant who has no fair chance of\r\nwinning ought to give in, and not persist in shedding blood in vain. If\r\na big man fights a little one, and turns out upon experiment to have\r\nnext to no chance of beating him, one soon gets angry with the big one\r\nfor \"pegging away,\" even though one may at first have perceived him to\r\nbe in the right. Such seemed to many English observers to be the\r\ncondition of the case in America. They were mistaken, but excusable; but\r\nfor the error in their premise, their deduction would have been correct,\r\nor at least not irrational.\r\n\r\n7th. The party which covertly or avowedly, justified slavery was\r\nincomparably larger than any Englishman would have dreamed of a week\r\nbefore the secession took place. Till then, I doubt whether any writer\r\nof credit, except one, had ventured deliberately to affirm that American\r\nslavery is, under limitations, an allowable and advantageous thing. That\r\nexception is assuredly a most illustrious one, perhaps the strongest\r\nhead and stoutest heart in the British dominions, and our living writer\r\nof the most exalted and durable fame,--Thomas Carlyle. His \"Occasional\r\nDiscourse on the Nigger Question,\" published some years ago, ruffled and\r\noutraged the anti-slavery mind, which then, and for some while before\r\nand since, might fairly be termed the mind of all England. That\r\nDiscourse staggered some readers, and roused others,--roused them to\r\ncontemplate the whole question from a more fundamental and actual, a\r\nless traditional and prejudged point of view, than had been in vogue\r\nsince our own abolition movement gained the ascendency. It became\r\napparent to various thinkers that the humanitarian view of the question\r\nwas not its be-all and end-all; that some facts and considerations _per\r\ncontra_ had to be taken into account; and that what one train of thought\r\nand feeling denounced as a mere self-condemned wrong might, according to\r\nanother, be even regarded as a higher right. Still, this \"new light\"\r\nupon slavery was received more or less fully by only a very few minds,\r\nas compared with the general mass of British conviction,--a few\r\nthorough-going believers in Carlyle, a few hardy and open-minded\r\nspeculators; hardly more, perhaps, in all, than those who would join Mr.\r\nJohn Stuart Mill in saying that the right form of Parliamentary suffrage\r\nis universal suffrage, open to women as well as men. No ordinary English\r\nnewspaper would have thought of professing at that time, nor any\r\nordinary English reader of tolerating, the theory that slavery is right.\r\n(It is no part of my plan or business to discuss this question of\r\nslavery: I will simply say, to avoid misapprehension, that, while\r\nrecognizing the profound good sense of much that Carlyle has said on\r\nthis and cognate matters, my own instinct of right and habits of opinion\r\nrebel against the pro-slavery theory, and never allowed me to doubt\r\nwhich side I was on, when the question came to its supreme practical\r\nissue in the civil war.) Such, then, appears to me to have been the\r\nstate of English opinion on this subject when the secession occurred. On\r\none ground or another, a large proportion of our population and our\r\nwriters sided with the South. At first I fancy that no journal and no\r\naverage Englishman affirmed that slavery is justifiable; but, as events\r\nprogressed, it became more and more difficult to say that the South was\r\nright, and yet that slavery was wrong. \"No man can serve two masters,\"\r\nnot even such a couple as Jefferson Davis and Wilberforce. The British\r\nsympathizers, who had determined to \"hold to the one,\" were reduced to\r\nthe logical necessity of \"despising the other.\" It was a surprising\r\nspectacle. The dogmas and traditions of half a century snapped like\r\nthreads, when it became their office to constrain a _penchant_.\r\nEthnologists and politicians were equally ready to find out that the\r\nnegro was fit for nothing but enforced servitude. Parsons,\r\nmarchionesses, and maiden aunts received simultaneous enlightenment as\r\nto Christian truth, and discovered that slavery was not prohibited, but\r\nwas even countenanced, in the Bible. The inference was inevitable: what\r\nMoses did not condemn in Jews thirty-three centuries ago must be the\r\ncorrect thing for Anglo-Americans to uphold at the present day. Did not\r\nSt. Paul tell Onesimus to return to his master? etc., etc. Many\r\nSecessionist organs of public opinion, no doubt, declined to commit\r\nthemselves to pro-slavery views: they started with the assumption that\r\nslavery is an evil and a crime, and they continued protesting the same\r\ncreed. How far this creed was compatible with so rabid an advocacy of\r\nthe Southern cause,--how far it was possible for genuine abominators of\r\nslavery to continue unfaltering their Southern palinodes and Northern\r\nanathemas, after such acts on the part of the South as the refusal to\r\ninclude colored troops among exchangeable prisoners of war, and the\r\nmassacre at Fort Pillow, and such acts on the part of the North as the\r\nEmancipation Proclamation, and the introduction of the Constitutional\r\nAmendment for abolition,--these are questions which appear deserving of\r\nan answer; yet one may be quite prepared to find that the spirit of\r\nparty, which made such an anomaly possible, is blind to the fact of its\r\nbeing anomalous, and has an answer pat. My own belief about the matter\r\nis this. When the Secession began, there were two sects among the\r\nEnglish partisans of the South: the Carlylese apologists of slavery,--a\r\nvery small sect; and the political advocates of Secession, who, partly\r\nwith full conviction, partly as a mere matter of unchallenged use and\r\nwont, repudiated slavery,--a very large sect. The Southern partisanship\r\nof the former sect was perfectly logical; that of the latter unable to\r\nstand the wear and tear of discussion, as the progress of events made it\r\nmore and more manifest that slavery or abolition was the real issue.\r\nWith this latter sect the political or other liking for the South was a\r\nmuch stronger and more active feeling than the humanitarian or other\r\ndislike of slavery; the first feeling, indeed, soon developed into a\r\npassion, the second into a self-reproachful obstruction. Thus the\r\nlogical view, that slavery as well as the slaveholding interest was\r\nright, exercised a powerful centripetal attraction; and many minds were\r\nbetrayed into adopting it as a truth, or using it for a purpose, without\r\nprobing the depth of apostasy to their own more solid convictions, or of\r\nmoral disingenuousness, which the practice involved. The South had to be\r\njustified, and here were at hand the means of justification. Now that\r\nthe contest is over, I have no doubt that a large residuum of tolerance\r\nfor slavery, much larger than seemed possible for Englishmen before the\r\nSecession, is left behind; but also that this tolerance was in most\r\ninstances factitious and occasional, and is cleared or clearing away,\r\nand will leave the British reprobation of slavery, in a little while,\r\npretty nearly where it used to be of old. The orange has been squeezed:\r\nwhat use can the rind be of? It rests with the re-United States, by a\r\njust and successful treatment of the still formidable negro question,[B]\r\nto persuade unreluctant minds in the Old Country that slavery is, in\r\nvery deed, the unmitigated wrong and nuisance which they used to reckon\r\nit; and those who have sympathized with the North look confidently for\r\nthis ultimate result.\r\n\r\nAs a corollary to all that I have been saying in this slight analysis of\r\nEnglish opinion during the war, I should add,--what, indeed, American\r\nwriters have abundantly observed,--that the knowledge of American\r\naffairs possessed by the great mass of English partisans was extremely\r\nsuperficial. I will not now speak of our newspapers and pamphleteers;\r\nbut, within my own experience, among ordinary persons, who were quite\r\nready to take sides, and stand stubbornly to their colors, I have often\r\nfound that even such rudimentary points as the distinction between\r\n\"States\" and \"Territories,\" the Northern resistance to the extension of\r\nslavery into Territories, the issue taken on that immediate question in\r\nthe Presidential election of 1860, the relation between the three\r\nFederal Government and the States' governments, and the limits within\r\nwhich it would be possible for a President and his administration,\r\nhowever anti-slavery in principle, to interfere with slavery, were\r\neither not understood in theory, or not practically laid to heart.\r\nPeople would talk as if a Federal President were a Russian autocrat,\r\nwho, if sincerely opposed to slavery, would have nothing in the world to\r\ndo except to cancel the \"peculiar institution\" throughout the States,\r\nNorth and South, by a motion of his will and a stroke of his pen. They\r\nwould demonstrate the half-heartedness on this matter of the North, as\r\nrepresented by its President Lincoln, and the hypocrisy or truckling of\r\nLincoln himself, by the omission of such a sealing of their professed\r\nfaith,--not caring to reflect how utterly subversive these notions must\r\nbe of that favorite catchword of Southern partisans; \"State rights.\" It\r\nmay be objected, \"These people can have been only the extremely\r\nignorant.\" That, however, is my own conviction: but such childish\r\nassumptions were not the less prevalent for being preposterous, nor the\r\nless potent in leavening the mass of opinion, when the question was,\r\nwhich party to adopt.\r\n\r\nSomething--but necessarily very brief and imperfect--may be added\r\nconcerning the particular organs of public opinion which sided with the\r\nNorth or with the South. I shall confine myself to London publications,\r\nnot knowing enough of those in the country to treat that subject even\r\nwith fairness, much less with command of the materials. I presume,\r\nhowever, that the tone of the London press furnishes a tolerable index\r\nto that of the provincial, taking the whole average.\r\n\r\nThe political color of the English press may be summarized as either\r\nConservative, Liberal, or Liberal-Conservative. The Conservative daily\r\npapers are the \"Standard\" and the \"Herald,\" both rabidly Southern. The\r\nprincipal Liberal ones are the \"Times,\" \"Globe,\" \"Telegraph,\" \"Daily\r\nNews,\" and \"Star.\" Of these five journals, three were for the South, and\r\nonly two for the North,--the two which I have named last. Two other\r\nLiberal daily papers are but little known to me,--the \"Advertiser\" and\r\nthe \"Sun\": I believe the latter was at any rate not decidedly Southern.\r\nEverybody knows that the Times is the Englishman's paper _par\r\nexcellence_; it would hardly be unfair to call us \"a Times-led\r\npopulation,\" unless, indeed, one prefers the term, \"a popularity-led\r\nTimes.\" Converse with ten ordinary middle-class Englishmen,--men of\r\nbusiness or position, receiving or imparting the current of opinion\r\nwhich is uppermost in their class,--probably nine of them will express\r\nviews which you will find amplified in the columns of the Times. That\r\njournal is neither above their level nor below it; as matters strike\r\nthem, so do they also strike the Times. Englishmen do not particularly\r\nrespect the Times; it is like them, (or in especial like the bustling,\r\nenergetic, money-making, money-spending classes of them,) and they are\r\nlike it; but an Englishman of this sort will not feel bound to \"look up\r\nto\" the Times any more than to another Englishman of the same class.\r\nThey reciprocally express each other, and with no obligation or claim to\r\nlofty regard on either side. When, therefore, one finds the Times\r\nabiding for a long while (which is not invariably its way) by one\r\nconstant view of a question, one may be sure that it is supported in\r\nthat view by an active, business-like, prominent, and probably even\r\npredominant body of its countrymen; but it by no means follows that the\r\ndeeper convictions of the nation, its hearty sentiments of right, for\r\nwhich it would be prepared to do or die, are either represented or\r\nroused by the newspaper. The Times, during the American War, was\r\ncursed--or cursed its readers--with prophets, seers, and oracles, in its\r\ncorrespondents; and the prophecies turned out to be ridiculously wrong,\r\nthe seeing to be purblindness, and the oracles to be gibberish. A more\r\nmiserable exposure could not easily be cited; the most indignant\r\nAmerican might afford to pity the Times, when, after four years of\r\nleonine roarings and lashings of tail, its roar sank into a whine, and\r\nits tail was clapped between its legs. The supremacy of the Times had\r\nalready been sapped by the abolition of the British paper-duty, and the\r\nconsequent starting of various penny-newspapers. If this _fiasco_ does\r\nnot gravely damage it, the reason can only, I suppose, be in the\r\nconformity of character and of impetus already pointed out between our\r\naverage middle class and the Times. The Englishman whom the Times has\r\nmisled for four years concerning the American struggle has a\r\nfellow-feeling for his Times even in the mortification of undeception;\r\nfor this Englishman had never supposed that the Times, any more than\r\nhimself, was actuated by profound political morality in the side it\r\nespoused--rather by personal proclivities, clamor, and \"rule of thumb.\"\r\nAnd so, when the next great question arises, the Englishman may again\r\nmake the Times his crony and confabulator, just as he would more likely,\r\nthrough general sympathy of notions and feelings, to take counsel with\r\nprivate acquaintances who had erred with him in predicting success to\r\nthe South, rather than with those who had dissented from him in desire\r\nand expectation. Certainly, however, after all allowances made, the\r\n_prestige_ of the Times must have received a perceptible shock. The\r\nother daily papers which I have named, along with the Times, as Southern\r\npartisans, represent divers sections of Liberalism; and there must be\r\nmore than I am cognizant of to say in detail of their views of various\r\nphases and at various periods in the contest. The two Northerners, the\r\nDaily News and the Star, (the latter being specially connected with Mr.\r\nJohn Bright,) represent the more advanced section of Liberalism: no\r\ndoubt their more thorough sympathy with the cause of the North was not\r\nunrelated to their more thorough sympathy with the political\r\nconstitution and influences of the American Republic; and the same would\r\nbe true of many private Northern adherents. In general, it may be said\r\nwithout much inexactness that the Northern advocates in the press\r\nbelonged either to this section of Liberalism or to the \"humanitarian\"\r\nand \"Evangelical\" categories--those which distinctly uphold\r\nAbolitionism, \"Aborigines-Protection,\" etc.; while the Southerners were\r\nrecruited from all other classes,--Conservative, Liberal, and\r\nLiberal-Conservative. To this class one may perhaps assign the last two\r\nof the daily papers, the \"Post\" and the \"Pall-Mall Gazette,\" the latter\r\nof which, however, was firmly on the side of the North; it only started\r\nduring the final stages of the war,--a time when (be it said without any\r\nderogation from the sincerity of the Pall-Mall Gazette) some other\r\npapers also would probably, from the aspect of the times, have been\r\nbetter inclined to take the same side, but for finding themselves\r\nalready up to the armpits in Secessionism. Passing now to the weekly\r\npapers, of which we can name only two or three, we find the Conservative\r\n\"Press,\" the Anglican-Clerical \"Guardian\" the \"Examiner,\"--a\r\nrepresentative of a somewhat old-fashioned form of Liberalism or\r\n\"Whiggery,\"--and the caustic, Liberal-Conservative \"Saturday Review,\"\r\n(already mentioned,) on the side of the South; the advanced Liberal\r\n\"Spectator\" on that of the North. It is a significant sign of the\r\nwidespread Southernism in all grades of town-society, especially the\r\nyoung and exuberant, the man-about-town class, the club-men, the jolly\r\nyoung bachelors, the tavern-politicians, that _all_ the \"comic\" papers\r\nwere on that side,--not only the now almost \"legitimated\" \"Punch,\"[C] a\r\nstaid grimalkin which has outgrown the petulances of kittenhood, or, as\r\nit has been well nicknamed erewhile, \"The Jackall of the Times,\" but\r\nequally the more free-and-easy \"Fun,\" the plebeian \"Comic News,\" the\r\nfashionable \"Owl,\" and the short-lived \"Arrow.\" Among the magazines, the\r\n\"Quarterly\" and \"Blackwood,\" with various others, not all of them\r\ncolleagues of these two in strict Conservatism, were for the South;\r\n\"Macmillan's Magazine,\" again an organ of the advanced and theoretic\r\nLiberalism, consistently for the North, so far as it could be considered\r\nto express aggregate, and not merely individual, views.\r\n\r\nOf our leading writers, taken personally, Carlyle was of course against\r\nthe North, and perhaps one may say on the side of the South, as shown by\r\nhis epigram, \"The American Iliad in a Nutshell,\"--one of the few\r\ninstances (if I may trust my own opinion concerning so great a genius)\r\nin which even his immense power of humor and pointed illustration has\r\nfallen flat and let off a firework which merely fizzed without flashing.\r\nRuskin also would appear, from some occasional expressions in what he\r\nhas published, to have adopted the same view; as, indeed, he very\r\ngenerally does \"Carlylize\" when Carlylean subject-matter engages his\r\npen. For the North three of the most distinguished and resolute writers\r\nhave been Mr. John Stuart Mill and Professors Cairnes and Goldwin\r\nSmith,--men on whose position and services in their own country to the\r\nFederal cause it is assuredly not for me to dilate.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving thus far, to the best of my ability, sketched the varieties of\r\nEnglish opinion concerning the great conflict, I must now endeavor to\r\nanalyze somewhat more in detail the phases and motives of that large and\r\npowerful section of it which was hostile to the North. Something has\r\nbeen already said or implied on this matter as we proceeded; but it\r\nremains to be distinctly accounted for. If, at the time when England\r\nbestowed cheap tears upon the sorrows of Uncle Tom, cheap aristocratic\r\nhomage upon Mrs. Stowe, and cheap or indeed gratis advice upon \"American\r\nsisters,\" any American or Continental paper had prophesied (seeing\r\nfarther into a millstone than Times prophets during the war) that the\r\nissues between Slavery and Abolition would, in a very few years, come to\r\na tremendous crisis and not less tremendous arbitrament, and that the\r\ngreat majority of the most trained and influential British opinion would\r\nthen be found on the side of the champions of Slavery, and against those\r\nof Abolition, the prediction would have been universally treated by\r\nEnglishmen as an emanation and a proof of the most grovelling malignity,\r\nnot less despicably silly than shamelessly calumnious. The time of trial\r\ncame; and what no one would have ventured to suggest as conceivable\r\nproved to be the actual and positive truth. There must have been some\r\ndeep-lying reason for this,--some reason which remained latent below the\r\nsurface as long as the United States were regarded as one integral\r\ncommunity, but which asserted itself as soon as Abolition and Slavery\r\nbecame identified, on the one hand, with national indivisibility, and,\r\non the other, with disruption. It seems impossible to doubt, that, had\r\nthe maintenance or the dissolution of slavery been the sole question,\r\nEngland would have continued true, without any noteworthy defection, to\r\nher traditions and professions reprobating slavery; and that, as she did\r\nnot decisively so continue, other incentives must have intervened,--the\r\ncause being in fact tried upon a different issue. Wherefore? It is to\r\nthat question that I now address myself.\r\n\r\nFour motives appear to me to have been puissant in indisposing\r\nEnglishmen to the Northerners. I speak generally of all such British men\r\nand women as sided with the South, and whom I imagine to have been not\r\nmuch less than half the whole number of those who took sides at\r\nall,--but more especially of the class in which Southern sympathy was\r\nthe very prevalent rule, and Northern sympathy the scanty exception.\r\nThis class comprehended the members of the leading professions, army,\r\nnavy, church, and bar, the writers upon events of the day in newspapers\r\nand elsewhere, and, broadly speaking, the moneyed and leading social\r\ncircles,--in short, \"the upper classes\"; and, to trust my own\r\nexperience, not only these, but the great bulk of, at any rate, the\r\nprofessional middle class as well. For instance, in the Government\r\noffice to which I belong, comprising some hundreds of _employes_, of\r\nwhom a tolerable percentage are known to me, I can recollect only one\r\nperson, besides myself, whom I knew to be decidedly for the North,--and\r\nhe, by the by, is an Irishman. I have used above the term \"the upper\r\nclasses\"; but I believe that the aristocracy, properly so called, was by\r\nno means so Southern as the society next below it. The first of the four\r\nmotives in question is one in whose potency it gives me no pleasure to\r\nbelieve, but it was, I think, by far the most powerful of all. The\r\nEnglish,[D] as a nation, dislike the Americans as a nation. This is a\r\nbroad statement, which I make, because, as far as my powers and\r\nopportunities of observation extend, I believe it to be true; but I am\r\nquite prepared to find it contested, or summarily denied, by many of my\r\ncountrymen,--the more, the better. The dislike, be it greater or less in\r\nfact, appears to me to rest upon two main foundations.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the Englishman is a born Conservative, or, to use\r\nthe old phrase, a Tory. Toryism is of two kinds,--political and social.\r\nThe majority of the nation is certainly not, at the present day, Tory in\r\npolitical preferences, though there is still a large leaven of that\r\nfeeling also. But very many persons who are political Liberals are\r\nsocial Tories: they venerate the aristocracy; they batten daily upon the\r\n\"Court Circular\"; they cling to class distinctions in theory, and still\r\nmore in practice; they strain towards \"good society\" and social\r\nconformity; their ideal is \"respectability.\" Indeed, it appears to me\r\nthat comparatively very few English people are free from some tincture\r\nof Toryism in either political or social sentiment, or both: one knows\r\nmany Radicals, some Democrats, and even a few theoretic Republicans; but\r\nit by no means follows that all or most of these are not Tories in\r\ngrain, in some part of their mental or personal anatomy. A total\r\nrevulsion in public and popular feeling would have to take place,\r\nbefore, for instance, such an institution as our House of Lords could be\r\nin any practical danger: no such revulsion appears to be within the\r\npurview of any one now living, even as a matter of opinion, much less of\r\npractical performance. I believe, that, if universal suffrage were to\r\nbecome the law of the land to-morrow, not much difference would ensue in\r\nthe _personnel_ or the tone of the House of Commons. It could hardly\r\nhelp ensuing, in the long run, by the inevitable reaction Of\r\ninstitutions upon the people who exercise or undergo them, and, with a\r\nchanged House of Commons, much else would, no doubt, be changed; but\r\nthere seems strong reason to doubt whether a democratic constituency\r\nwould, in the earlier stages, produce a decisively democratic body of\r\nrepresentatives. As regards English opinion upon the American dispute,\r\nnothing was commoner than the remark, that the Southerners were \"the\r\nbetter gentlemen,\" or \"represented the aristocratic element,\" and\r\ntherefore commanded the speaker's good wishes in their struggle; and\r\nthis not necessarily from members of the landed gentry, or from\r\npolitical anti-liberals, but equally from Liverpool merchants, or others\r\nof the middle class. The remark may have been true or incorrect,--with\r\nthat I have nothing to do; but it was very generally accepted in England\r\nas accurate, and represented a large body of consequent sympathy. In\r\nlike manner, people were slow to believe in the possibility of Lincoln's\r\ncompetence for his post; because he rose from the populace to his great\r\nelevation, they inferred that he was a boor and a bungler, not (as might\r\nhave seemed equally fair and rather more logical) that he was a capable\r\nman; and, with a foregone conclusion, they were quite ready to construe\r\nas blundering and grotesque that line of policy and conduct on his part,\r\nwhich, after a war of no immoderate length, resulted in the surmounting\r\nof obstacles which they had dubbed insurmountable.\r\n\r\nThis innate British temper--aristocratic, conservative, or Tory,\r\nwhichever one may term it--is the first of the two foundations whereon\r\nEnglish dislike of Americans appears to me to rest. The second is a\r\nnatural, though assuredly not a laudable feeling,--the residual soreness\r\nleft by our defeat in the old American War of Independence. Far be it\r\nfrom me to say that the English nation at large, or Englishmen\r\nindividually, brood gloomily over that defeat, or, with active and\r\nconscious malignity, long for the desolation of their brothers in blood,\r\nlanguage, and a common history. To say that would be as strained and\r\nexaggerated, and as contrary to British practicality and freedom from\r\nvengefulness, as to deny that some degree of soreness and distance\r\nremains would seem to me uncandid. Englishmen are quite ready to\r\nbelieve, and to light upon the casual evidences, that Frenchmen remember\r\nWaterloo, and would have no objection to wipe out the reminiscence upon\r\noccasion; and Frenchmen and Americans may probably perceive that like\r\ncauses lead to like results in the Englishmen's own case, although the\r\nlatter are less quick-sighted regarding that. There is, I apprehend,\r\nquite enough soreness on the subject to lead us to watch the career of\r\nthe United States with jealousy, to take offence easily where the\r\nrelative interests of both countries are concerned, to put the less\r\nfavorable of two possible constructions upon American doings, and to\r\nfeel as if, in any reverse which may happen to the States, a certain\r\nlong-standing score of our own, which we did not clear off quite\r\nsatisfactorily to ourselves, were in a round-about course of settlement.\r\n\r\nIt may perhaps be rejoined, \"Even admitting what you have said as to\r\nBritish conservatism and soreness, and consequent dislike of Americans,\r\nthis furnishes no reason why the more influential classes in England\r\nshould have sided with Southern rather than Northern Americans.\" But I\r\ncannot acknowledge the force of the rejoinder. The United States are,\r\nlike any other nation, represented by their Government, with which the\r\nNorthern and Union section was in harmony, the Southern and Disunion\r\nsection in conflict; indeed, the very fact of secession divided the\r\nSouth from the obnoxious entity, the United States, and so far ranged\r\nthe South under the same banner with all other antagonists of the States\r\nand their Government. The anti-American might with perfect consistency\r\nplead for his Southernism, \"Not that I disliked Carolina less, but that\r\nI disliked Massachusetts more.\" Besides, there was a very prevalent\r\nimpression that the Southern Confederacy would be an essentially\r\naristocratic commonwealth, as contrasted with the democratic Northern\r\nUnion,--an impression which the peculiar conditions of society in the\r\nSouth would hardly have failed to justify to the full, had a cessation\r\nof the war allowed the Confederacy to develop internally, according to\r\nits own bias. Rumors were even rife of a possible monarchy; and leading\r\nSoutherners were credited with the statement, that the best upshot of\r\nall, would popular prejudice in the South but allow of it, would be to\r\nimport a king from the English royal family. Such rumors may have been\r\nfallacious, but they were not unacceptable to the British Tory. On the\r\nother hand, the disruption of the United States by the secession of the\r\nSouth was continually spoken of as \"the breakdown of Democracy,\" or \"the\r\nbubble of Democracy has burst.\" The experiment of a great federative\r\nrepublic--or, one might say, of a great republic, whether federative or\r\notherwise--was held to have been tried, and to have broken down. The\r\nfact that there would be two republics, jointly coextensive with the\r\noriginal one, went for little, inasmuch as neither of the two could be\r\nas powerful as that one, and they would be divided by conflicting policy\r\nand interests, even if not engaged in active hostilities. All these\r\nconsiderations were not only powerful determinants to Southernism, but\r\nin themselves balm to the conservative heart, and hardly less so to that\r\noverwhelming section of educated liberal opinion in this country, which,\r\ngenuinely liberal though its politics may be according to the English\r\nstandard, abhors all approach towards what is termed \"Americanizing our\r\ninstitutions,\" and is fully as eager as the strictly conservative class\r\nto lay hold of any facts which may make monarchy appear a stable, and\r\nrepublicanism an unstable system. It was but a very short time before\r\nthe fall of Richmond that I heard an Englishman, so far from\r\nanticipating the catastrophe of the South, repeat the threadbare augury\r\nof the Times and other journals, that the remaining Federal States would\r\nyet split up into a Western and an Eastern aggregation. The Cerberus of\r\nDemocracy was to start his three heads off on three different roads, by\r\nthat process common in many of the lower animal organisms, known to\r\nzooelogists as \"fission\"; and monarchists were fain to augur that very\r\nlittle of either bite or bark would be thereafter native to his jaws.\r\n\r\nSuch are the grounds on which I think that British conservatism and\r\nsoreness produce a widely diffused feeling of national dislike to\r\nAmericans, and that this dislike, beyond all other motives, indisposed\r\nmultitudes to the Northern cause. Three other motives conducing to the\r\nsame result remain to be analyzed.\r\n\r\nMany Englishmen believe--as will have been abundantly apparent to\r\nAmericans during the vicissitudes of the last few years--that the\r\ngreatness of the United States involves a serious danger to England,\r\nwhether in the projects upon Canada which are attributed to the States,\r\nor in other directions, such as that of naval power. It is no business\r\nof mine to discuss the validity of this belief, but simply to record it\r\nas one important motive why the success of the Federal Government was\r\nnot desired. It is a substantial and a reasoned motive; and very few\r\npersons, whether in England or out of it, are so cosmopolite or\r\ncalm-minded as to assume that the growth and aggrandizement of a foreign\r\npower, in its proportional relation to one's own nation, are matter for\r\nbrotherly satisfaction and congratulation without _arriere pensee_,\r\nprovided always that growth proceeds from internal conditions honorable\r\nto the foreigner, and not in themselves derogatory or offensive to the\r\nhome-power. Few will heartily say, \"Let our neighbors and competitors\r\ndevelop to their uttermost, and welcome; be it our sole care that we\r\nalso develop to _our_ uttermost. They shall run us as close as they\r\nlike, and shall find that we do not mean to be run down.\" To say this\r\nmight be an act of national Christianity; but it is not one which has\r\never been in very active exercise or popular repute. It may be observed,\r\ntoo, that, besides all other causes of national vigilance or jealousy,\r\nthe Trent affair, at an early date in the war, brought the whole\r\npractical question very forcibly home to us; and though Englishmen\r\nalmost unanimously, within the limits of my reading and hearing,\r\nprotested that a rupture with the United States would be formidable and\r\ndisabling only to that belligerent, (a point on which I ventured to\r\nfancy that British self-confidence might not have fathomed all the\r\npossibilities of Providence,) the crisis did not the less tend to rouse\r\nall our defensive and some of our aggressive instincts, and to weight\r\nthe scales of public feeling against the North. The question of perils\r\nfrom American power then passed out of the region of mere theory, and\r\nbecame practical and imminent. The danger itself dispersed, indeed, as\r\nsuddenly as it had come, but the impression remained.\r\n\r\nAnother motive for siding against the North was the abstract hatred of\r\nwar, which has grown to be a very widespread and genuine feeling in\r\nEngland,--and, in my humble opinion, a most befitting and praiseworthy\r\none,--active whenever we are in the position of outsiders, and overborne\r\nonly when our own passions and real or supposed interests are involved.\r\nThe great majority of the nation plunged headlong into the Russian War,\r\nand the grip of the British bull-dog's teeth upon his opponent was not\r\neasily loosed, even when good cause for loosing it appeared. We had no\r\nmore notion of retiring from India in 1857, when the Indian mutineers\r\nused some cogency of material argument to make us do so, than we should\r\nhave of retiring from Ireland, if a new Irish rebellion occurred; but\r\nwhen the question was merely that of breaking up a vast republic beyond\r\nthe Atlantic in the interests of negro slavery, the horrors and\r\nwickedness of war were obvious and impressive to us. That historical\r\nphrase of General Scott's, \"Wayward sisters, go in peace!\" was very\r\ngenerally, and I think rightly, regarded as expressing one of the points\r\nof view which might with honor, caution, and consistency have been acted\r\nupon, when the tremendous decision between peace and war had to be made.\r\nThe opposite point of view was also tenable: it was adopted with\r\noverwhelming impulse by the Federal Government and the loyal States;\r\nand, having been carried out to a triumphant conclusion, may be admitted\r\nto have been the wisest and most patriotic, even by persons who (and I\r\nwill not deny having been one of them from time to time during the war)\r\nwere induced to doubt whether any cause, however equitable, and any\r\nobject, however righteous and great, sufficed to justify the frightful\r\ndevastation and carnage which their prosecution involved. If such doubts\r\nbeset the adherents of the North, of course the view of the matter\r\nentertained by opponents of war in the abstract, who were also on the\r\nside of the South, was incomparably stronger in reprobation of this\r\nparticular war. True, it might be urged, that the South, and not the\r\nNorth, both furnished the _casus belli_, and began the actual\r\nhostilities by the assault upon Fort Sumter; but it was not the cue of\r\nSouthern partisans to admit that this internal action of certain\r\nsovereign States of the Union was of a nature to justify coercive war on\r\nthe part of the North, while the fact that it rested with the North to\r\ndecline or accept the challenge was patent to the friends of both\r\nbelligerents. Thus, when the enormous magnitude and horrors of the war\r\nstartled English onlookers, the odium, in the opinion of many, attached\r\nto the North: a view which, though it might not stand the test of strict\r\ninvestigation, or of a severe discussion of principles and provocations,\r\nwas superficially maintainable, and not to be anyhow argued out of all\r\nplausibility. \"The South is defensive, and the North aggressive,\" one\r\ndisputant might say. \"Yes,\" would be the reply, \"at this stage of the\r\ncontest; but ascend a step higher, and it is the South which made an\r\naggression on the Union, and the North is defending that.\" \"Still, the\r\nNorth might have abstained from defending it, and might have said,\r\n'Wayward sisters, go in peace!'\" \"It might; but it saw good reason for\r\nsaying the reverse.\" \"Still, it might.\" This seems a fair enough\r\nstatement of the case between North and South, so far as the mere\r\nquestion of fact as to responsibility for the war is concerned. Beyond\r\nthis, one must go to the larger questions, whether any causes justify\r\nwar, and whether this individual cause was one of them,--questions, as I\r\nhave said, to which the English mind tends to return a negative answer,\r\nsave when England herself is affected. The very men who could least see\r\na pretext for a war by the Federal people against the seceded States\r\nwere those who would most eagerly have rushed into a war to sustain the\r\nBritish claim in the Trent affair.\r\n\r\nLastly, there was a generous and an especially English motive for\r\nanti-Northern partisanship,--the feeling of sympathy with the weaker\r\nside, which was unmistakably the Southern; a generous motive, but not to\r\nbe trusted too far in deciding between any two litigants. Besides the\r\nmere inferiority of strength, the splendid valor and enterprising spirit\r\nof the South stirred the British heart and blood, and commanded\r\nnumberless good wishes; while, for some time after the first battle of\r\nBull Run, a prejudice, not readily amenable to reasoning, clung around\r\nthe Northern arms, and impeded many from doing full relative justice to\r\nthe military temper and prowess of the Unionists. There was, moreover, a\r\nvery widespread impression that the North was carrying on the war\r\nchiefly by means of mercenaries,--Germans, Irishmen, and \"the\r\noffscourings of Europe,\" as the uncomplimentary phrase ran,--who\r\nenlisted for the sake of the bounty, and were equally prompt at\r\nexhibiting their indifferentism to the grave issues at stake and their\r\nblackguardism in dealing with the hostile populations. The Southerners,\r\non the contrary, figured as a chivalrous territorial body driven to\r\nfight \"for their hearths and homes,\" (I have even seen \"their altars\" in\r\nprint,) waging a noble defensive war against preconcerted spoliation and\r\ndespotism. To this moment, many people have phrases of the above sort\r\nupon their lips.\r\n\r\nThen there were certain personal feelings which told powerfully in the\r\nsame direction,--personal partly to the English as a nation, and partly\r\nto the more prominent actors in the war. The contrast between the\r\nAmerican colonies of Great Britain throwing off their allegiance to the\r\nOld Country because they saw fit to do so for their own interests, and\r\nthe government of the Federation of these same ex-colonies insisting\r\nthat some of them, which in their turn see fit to break loose from the\r\nFederal pact, shall not do so, under the alternative of war and the\r\npains of treason,--this contrast is assuredly a glaring one; many people\r\nconsidered that it amounted to a positive anomaly,--not a few to a\r\nbarefaced act of tyrannic apostasy. The personal feeling of the English\r\npeople, their national _amour propre_, conspired to lead towards this\r\nharshest construction of the facts: it was so tempting to convict our\r\nold adversaries out of their own mouths, and make them, by the logic of\r\nevents, read out either their recantation of the Colonial Revolution, or\r\ntheir self-condemnation for the Anti-Secession War. I have already\r\nexplained to what extent these views appear to me to be tenable, and\r\nwhere their weak point lies: that both the insurrection of the colonies\r\nagainst England, and that of the South against the Federation,--both the\r\nrepressive measures of England against the colonies, and of the\r\nFederation against the South,--were in themselves founded on an\r\nindefeasible right, and abstractly defensible; and that the \"casting\r\nvote,\" (so to speak,) in both cases, depends, not upon any wordy denial\r\nof the right, but upon a thorough estimate of all the attendant\r\nconditions, and prominently of the \"mights of man.\"\r\n\r\nSo far for one phase of the personal question. The other phase pertained\r\nto the character and the deeds of some leading actors in the war-drama.\r\nTo most English apprehensions, _the_ hero of the war, from an early\r\nstage of it up to his tragic death, was Stonewall Jackson, whose place\r\nwas afterwards taken, in popular esteem, though not in coequal\r\nenthusiasm, by General Lee, both of them Southerners; while the _bete\r\nnoire_ of the story was General Butler, the Northerner. It would be\r\nfutile to expound the reasons of this, patent as they are to everybody;\r\nor to inquire what deductions from the renown of Jackson and Lee, or\r\nwhat allowances for the position of Butler, a judicial review of the\r\nwhole case would proclaim to be equitable. I will only remark here,\r\nthat, as far as my observation extended, no one complained of Jackson,\r\nwhen it transpired that he had been resolutely in favor of refusing all\r\nquarter to Northern soldiers: a severity, not to say barbarism, which,\r\nbe it right or wrong in itself, would undoubtedly have appeared to many\r\natrocious enough, had it been the doctrine of any Northern general, and\r\nbeside which the sternest measures of Butler look lax and conciliatory.\r\nIn like manner, the terrible treatment of Northern prisoners, and the\r\nmost savage act of war in the whole contest, the massacre at Fort\r\nPillow,[E] seemed hardly to graze that delicate susceptibility of\r\nSouthern partisans which was lashed into a white rage by a few words of\r\nprinted proclamation from Butler's hand; the facts were either ignored,\r\nor dismissed as of secondary importance in the general conduct of the\r\nwar. Of two other prime actors in the contest, President Davis and\r\nPresident Lincoln, the popular judgment seemed equally arbitrary. Of\r\ncourse each had his admirers among professed Southern or Northern\r\nadherents: it is not in that aspect that I speak of them for the moment,\r\nbut rather as figures in the popular imagination. As such, Davis was\r\ncredited with all the qualities of a powerful statesman; while Lincoln\r\nshowed as a not ill-meaning, but grotesquely inadequate and misplaced\r\noddity, a sort of mere accident of mob-favor, and made abundant mirth\r\nfor the mirthful: how justly the event has perhaps demonstrated. Among\r\nthe Northern generals, I think that the only one who became to some\r\nextent generally popular, though bitterly denounced in adverse quarters,\r\nwas Sherman,--not only for the splendor and originality of his practical\r\nachievements, but for a certain incisive and peremptory realism in his\r\nadministrative proceedings, which almost marked him with a touch of grim\r\nhumor.\r\n\r\nI have thus sought to account for the anti-Northern bias in a large\r\nnumber of my countrymen, by their dislike of the American nation and\r\npolity, arising partly from the remains of soreness left by past\r\ndefeat,--by the jealousy of American power, as a practical danger,--by\r\nthe hatred of war,--and by the sympathy for the gallant weaker\r\ncombatant. I am compelled reluctantly to add, that the particular\r\noperation of these various influences reflects no credit upon British\r\nconsistency of farsightedness. The conservative temper which stiffens\r\nEnglishmen towards America was the very same which, in the interests of\r\nthe moment, led them to justify violent revolutionary measures, and\r\narmed resistance to the constitutional and national majority. The\r\ngreater the conservative, the greater the advocate of insurrection. In\r\nlike manner, the English detestation of slavery was overwhelmed by\r\nsympathy for an \"oppressed\" community, whose oppression (apart from the\r\nmuch-paraded tariff and other such questions) consisted in a definite\r\nintimation that they would not henceforward be allowed to enlarge the\r\narea of slavery, and in a suspicion present to their own minds that even\r\nthe existing area of that cherished institution would be narrowed, and\r\nfinally reduced to nought,--expunged \"as a man wipeth a dish, wiping it\r\nand turning it upside down.\" The friends among us of constitutional\r\nliberty and of legality, the enemies of anarchy, the unseduced\r\nexecrators of slavery, the upholders of the tie of brotherhood across\r\nthe Atlantic, may well look back with shame to the time--and it was no\r\nmatter of days or weeks, but a period of about four years together--when\r\nthe loudest and most accepted voices in England exulted over the now\r\nludicrously delusive proposition that the United States were a burst\r\nbubble, and slavery the irremovable corner-stone of an empire. It may be\r\na lesson to nations against the indulgence in rancor, the abnegation of\r\nthe national conscience, and the dear delight of prophesying one's own\r\nlikings. \"Now, therefore, behold, the Lord hath put a lying spirit in\r\nthe mouth of these thy prophets, and the Lord hath spoken evil against\r\nthee.\"\r\n\r\nThe collapse of the South came at last; and nearly at the same moment\r\ncame the murder of a man whose modesty, integrity, firmness,\r\nsingle-minded persistency, unresentfulness, and substantial truth of\r\njudgment have been invested by his fate with an almost sacred depth of\r\ninterest and significance,--President Lincoln. Amid the many momentous\r\nbearings of these events, it is for me to note only one of comparative\r\nunimportance,--the effect which they produced upon English public\r\nopinion. There was, I think, a certain good-fortune for Southern\r\nsympathizers, in the fact that the announcement of Lincoln's death\r\nalmost synchronized with that of the surrender of the Confederate\r\narmies. After so many confident anticipations and loud predictions of a\r\nSouthern triumph, so many denunciations of the policy, acts, and leaders\r\nof the North, these sympathizers found themselves in a sort of\r\ncul-de-sac when Richmond had been taken. Lee had yielded, Johnston was\r\nyielding, and the very same \"butcher\" Grant, \"ruthless\" Sherman, and\r\n\"Yahoo\" Lincoln, whose savageries and imbecilities had been the theme of\r\nannual moral-pointing, were reading the world a lesson of moderation and\r\nself-forgetfulness in victory, such as almost seemed to shrink from the\r\nplentitude of a triumph which was a humiliation to some of their\r\ncountrymen. The sympathizers found that they were and had long been of\r\nthe party in evil odor with that modern \"Providence which sides with the\r\nstronger battalions,\" not to speak of the older \"God of Battles.\" They\r\nwere pulled up sharp in the direction they had been going in, and the\r\nalternative of turning right round and retracing their steps was a very\r\nawkward and unwelcome one. The assassination of Lincoln came to their\r\nrelief. They could join, without insincerity, in the burst of public\r\nfeeling which that terrible deed excited; could merge their protests\r\nagainst Lincoln in the established unwillingness to say evil of the\r\ndead; could give momentary pause to national and political\r\nconsiderations, beside the grave of one preeminent citizen; and could\r\nstart afresh afterwards, with a new situation, and a new chief figure in\r\nit to contemplate. President Johnson had taken the place of President\r\nLincoln, and had, at the hands of many of Lincoln's vituperators,\r\nsucceeded to an inheritance of the abuse lavished upon him. Neither\r\ncaution nor moderation had been learned by some, suitable as were the\r\ncircumstances of Lincoln's death for teaching the lesson. Of late,\r\nhowever, I have observed symptoms of a decided change in this respect:\r\nthe policy of President Johnson being recognized as broad, generous,\r\nresolute, and auspicious of the best results. I think this feeling, and\r\na general sentiment of respect and good-will for the United States,\r\npromise to grow rapidly and powerfully among my countrymen,--who, true\r\nonce again to their conservative instincts, will look with a certain\r\nregard upon a nation which can show those elements of solidity and\r\n\"respectability,\" a tremendous past war, and a heavy national debt, with\r\naugmented authority in the central government. John Bull's ill-humor\r\nagainst the \"Yankees\" has been in vigorous exercise these four years,\r\nand has assumed fair latitude for growling itself out: it has been\r\npalpably wrong in some of its inferences; for the bubble of Democracy\r\nhas _not_ burst, nor the Republic been split up into two or three\r\nfederations, nor the abolition of slavery been a mere pretext and\r\nhypocrisy. Englishmen, with their practical turn, and candid frankness\r\ntowards those to whom they have done less than right, may be expected in\r\nthe future to look upon the States with a degree of confidence and\r\ncordiality long deplorably absent. The events of the war have, in the\r\nlong run, compelled even the hostile party to respect the Unionists and\r\ntheir government: the plague of slavery is fast going, and, with its\r\ndisappearance, will relieve Englishmen from either (as they used to do)\r\nreprobating the Americans as abettors of and trucklers to the barbaric\r\ninstitution, or else (as they have been doing of late) from inventing\r\nhalf-sincere excuses for that same institution, to subserve partisan\r\nfeelings. As matters stand at present in the United States, there\r\nappears to be only one contingency which would again rouse into a fierce\r\nflame the glowing embers of pro-Southern sentiment among Englishmen, and\r\nrestore Southerners to the position of angels of light, and Northerners\r\nto that of angels of darkness, in British imaginations. This contingency\r\nis harshness in the treatment and trial of ex-President Davis, and more\r\nespecially his execution as a traitor. Southern sympathizers declare\r\nthat such a proceeding would be an abominable crime: the steadiest, most\r\nthorough, and most confiding adherents of the North believe, that,\r\nwhatever else it might be, it would, at any rate, be most\r\ndeplorable,--an ugly blight-spot upon laurels won arduously and\r\ngloriously, and as yet nobly worn.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have now, in however cursory or limping a mode, gone over the ground I\r\nproposed to cover. The main conclusion of all may be summarized in the\r\nbriefest terms thus. A slight majority of the whole British nation\r\nprobably sided with the North, and that chiefly on anti-slavery grounds:\r\na great majority of the more influential classes, certainly, sided with\r\nthe South, and that chiefly on general grounds of antagonism to the\r\nUnited States. For anything I have said which may possibly sound\r\negotistic or intrusive,--still more for anything erroneous or unfair in\r\nmy statements or point of view,--I must commit myself to the candid\r\nconstruction of my reader, be he American or English, be he on the same\r\nside of the question as myself, or on the opposite one.\r\n\r\nW. M. ROSETTI.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: I remember meeting at dinner, just about this time, a near\r\nrelative of the American ambassador, Mr. Adams. I expressed myself as\r\nanxious, but barely able, to believe that the Northerners would yet gain\r\nthe day, and asked whether he candidly supposed they would. His emphatic\r\n\"Certainly\" surprised me at the time, and remained in my mind as an\r\nalmost sublime instance of a true citizen's inability to \"despair of the\r\nRepublic.\" It soon turned out to be a deserved rebuke to any who\r\ndesponded, along with myself, and finally prophetic. No doubt there were\r\nthousands of Americans who could, even in those dark days, with equal\r\nconviction have pronounced that \"Certainly,\" and whose very certainty\r\nwas the one thing needed and able to make the thing certain indeed.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote B: As some time may have elapsed, and some change in the state\r\nof facts occurred, before this article appears in print, I add that it\r\nwas completed early in October.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote C: Probably many of my American readers are aware that Punch,\r\nafter doing its little best to make Lincoln ridiculous (which perhaps\r\nhistory will pronounce no easy job) throughout his administration,\r\nrecanted as soon as he had been murdered, and made the _amende\r\nhonorable_ in terms as handsome as the case admitted of. It is one more\r\ninstance of the mania which some writers have for saying ill-natured and\r\nunfair things, which they themselves must know to be not the real\r\nopinion which they would profess under circumstances when their _amour\r\npropre_ becomes enlisted on the same side as candor.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote D: Of course I very often employ the term \"English,\" as\r\nmeaning \"the natives of all or any parts of the United Kingdom,\" without\r\nmaking nice distinctions between English, Scotch, and Irish. Such is the\r\ncase here. As a matter of fact, however, I presume that America and the\r\nFederal Government have found and find somewhat more sympathy in\r\nScotland and Ireland than in England: the Scotch, spite of their\r\n\"clannish\" tendencies, have a certain democratic bias as well (chiefly,\r\nperhaps, evidenced and fostered by their religious organization); and\r\nthe Irish, disaffected as they are towards England having so numerous\r\nand so close ties, through the emigration movement, with the United\r\nStates.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote E: For American readers any confirmatory testimony as to this\r\nmassacre is no doubt superfluous. But, in case these pages should obtain\r\nany English readers, I may perhaps be allowed to say that the fact of\r\nthe massacre of the vanquished colored garrison has been attested to me.\r\n_viva voce_, by a Confederate, and still Secessionist, army surgeon, who\r\nwitnessed it with his own eyes.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO PICTURES.\r\n\r\n\r\n    In sky and wave the white clouds swam,\r\n    And the blue hills of Nottingham\r\n      Through gaps of leafy green\r\n      Across the lake were seen,--\r\n\r\n    When, in the shadow of the ash\r\n    That dreams its dream in Attitash,\r\n      In the warm summer weather,\r\n      Two maidens sat together.\r\n\r\n    They sat and watched in idle mood\r\n    The gleam and shade of lake and wood,--\r\n      The beach the keen light smote,\r\n      The white sail of a boat,--\r\n\r\n    Swan flocks of lilies shoreward lying,\r\n    In sweetness, not in music, dying,--\r\n      Hardhack and virgin's-bower,\r\n      And white-spiked clethra-flower.\r\n\r\n    With careless ears they heard the plash\r\n    And breezy wash of Attitash,\r\n      The wood-bird's plaintive cry,\r\n      The locust's sharp reply.\r\n\r\n    And teased the while, with playful hand,\r\n    The shaggy dog of Newfoundland,\r\n      Whose uncouth frolic spilled\r\n      Their baskets berry-filled.\r\n\r\n    Then one, the beauty of whose eyes\r\n    Was evermore a great surprise,\r\n      Tossed back her queenly head,\r\n      And, lightly laughing, said,--\r\n\r\n    \"No bridegroom's hand be mine to hold\r\n    That is not lined with yellow gold;\r\n      I tread no cottage-floor;\r\n      I own no lover poor.\r\n\r\n    \"My love must come on silken wings,\r\n    With bridal lights of diamond rings,--\r\n      Not foul with kitchen smirch,\r\n      With tallow-dip for torch.\"\r\n\r\n    The other, on whose modest head\r\n    Was lesser dower of beauty shed,\r\n      With look for home-hearths meet,\r\n      And voice exceeding sweet,\r\n\r\n    Answered,--\"We will not rivals be;\r\n    Take thou the gold, leave love to me;\r\n      Mine be the cottage small,\r\n      And thine the rich man's hall.\r\n\r\n    \"I know, indeed, that wealth is good;\r\n    But lowly roof and simple food,\r\n      With love that hath no doubt,\r\n      Are more than gold without.\"\r\n\r\n    Behind the wild grape's tangled screen,\r\n    Beholding them, himself unseen,\r\n      A young man, straying near,\r\n      The maidens chanced to hear.\r\n\r\n    He saw the pride of beauty born,\r\n    He heard the red lips' words of scorn;\r\n      And, like a silver bell,\r\n      That sweet voice answering well.\r\n\r\n    \"Why trust,\" he said, \"my foolish eyes?\r\n    My ear has pierced the fair disguise;\r\n      Who seeks my gold, not me,\r\n      My bride shall never be.\"\r\n\r\n    The supreme hours unnoted come;\r\n    Unfelt the turning tides of doom;\r\n      And so the maids laughed on,\r\n      Nor dreamed what Fate had done:\r\n\r\n    Nor knew the step was Destiny's\r\n    That rustled in the birchen trees,\r\n      As, with his life forecast\r\n      Anew, the listener passed.\r\n\r\n    Erelong by lake and rivulet side\r\n    The summer roses paled and died,\r\n      And Autumn's fingers shed\r\n      The maple's leaves of red.\r\n\r\n    Through the long gold-hazed afternoon,\r\n    Alone, but for the diving loon,\r\n      The partridge in the brake,\r\n      The black duck on the lake,\r\n\r\n    Beneath the shadow of the ash\r\n    Sat man and maid by Attitash;\r\n      And earth and air made room\r\n      For human hearts to bloom.\r\n\r\n    Soft spread the carpets of the sod,\r\n    And scarlet-oak and golden-rod\r\n      With blushes and with smiles\r\n      Lit up the forest aisles.\r\n\r\n    The mellow light the lake aslant,\r\n    The pebbled margin's ripple-chant\r\n      Attempered and low-toned,\r\n      The tender mystery owned.\r\n\r\n    And through the dream the lovers dreamed\r\n    Sweet sounds stole in and soft lights streamed;\r\n      The sunshine seemed to bless,\r\n      The air was a caress.\r\n\r\n    Not she who lightly scoffed was there,\r\n    With jewels in her midnight hair,\r\n      Her dark, disdainful eyes,\r\n      And proud lips worldly-wise;\r\n\r\n    But she who could for love dispense\r\n    With all its gilded accidents,\r\n      And trust her heart alone,\r\n      Found love and gold her own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FREEDMAN'S STORY.\r\n\r\nIN TWO PARTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\nThe manuscript of the following pages has been handed to me with the\r\nrequest that I would revise it for publication, or weave its facts into\r\na story which should show the fitness of the Southern black for the\r\nexercise of the right of suffrage.\r\n\r\nIt is written in a fair, legible hand; its words are correctly spelled;\r\nits facts are clearly stated, and--in most instances--its sentences are\r\nproperly constructed. Therefore it needs no revision. On reading it over\r\ncarefully, I also discover that it is in itself a stronger argument for\r\nthe manhood of the negro than any which could be adduced by one not\r\nhimself a freedman; for it is the argument of facts, and facts are the\r\nmost powerful logic. Therefore, if I were to imbed these facts in the\r\nmud of fiction, I should simply oblige the reader to dredge for the\r\noyster, which in this narrative he has without the trouble of dredging,\r\nfresh and juicy as it came from the hand of Nature,--or rather, from the\r\nhand of one of Nature's noblemen,--and who, until he was thirty years of\r\nage, had never put two letters together.\r\n\r\nThe narrative is a plain and unpretending account of the life of a man\r\nwhose own right arm--to use his own expression--won his rights as a\r\nfreeman. It is written with the utmost simplicity, and has about it the\r\nverisimilitude which belongs to truth, and to truth only when told by\r\none who has been a doer of the deeds and an actor in the scenes which he\r\ndescribes. It has the further rare merit of being written by one of the\r\n\"despised race\"; for none but a negro can fully and correctly depict\r\nnegro life and character.\r\n\r\nGeneral Thomas--a Southern man, and a friend of the Southern negro--was\r\nonce in conversation with a gentleman who has attained some reputation\r\nas a delineator of the black man, when a long, lean, \"poor white man,\"\r\nthen a scout in the Union army, approached the latter, and, giving his\r\nshoulder a familiar slap, accosted him with,--\r\n\r\n\"How are you, ole feller?\"\r\n\r\nThe gentleman turned about, and forgetting, in his joy at meeting an old\r\nfriend, the presence of this most dignified of our military men,\r\nresponded to the salutation of the scout in an equally familiar and\r\nboisterous manner. General Thomas \"smiled wickedly,\" and quietly\r\nremarked,--\r\n\r\n\"You seem to know each other.\"\r\n\r\n\"Know _him_!\" exclaimed the scout. \"Why, Gin'ral, I ha'n't seed him fur\r\nfourteen year; but I sh'u'd know him, ef his face war as black as it war\r\none night when we went ter a nigger shindy tergether!\"\r\n\r\nThe gentleman colored up to the roots of his hair, and stammered out,--\r\n\r\n\"That was in my boy days, General, when I was sowing my wild oats.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't apologize, Sir,\" answered the General, \"don't apologize; for I\r\nsee that to your youthful habit of going to negro shindies we owe your\r\ntruthful pictures of negro life.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the General was right. Every man and woman who has essayed to depict\r\nthe slave character has miserably failed, unless inoculated with the\r\ngenuine spirit of the negro; and even those who have succeeded best have\r\ndone only moderately well, because they have not had the negro nature.\r\nIt is reserved to some black Shakspeare or Dickens to lay open the\r\nwonderful humor, pathos, poetry, and power which slumber in the negro's\r\nsoul, and which now and then flash out like the fire from a\r\nthunder-cloud.\r\n\r\nI do not mean to say that this black prophet has come in this\r\nnarrative. He has not. This man is a doer, not a writer; though he gives\r\nus--particularly in the second part--touches of Nature, and little bits\r\nof description, which are perfectly inimitable. The prophet is still to\r\ncome; and he _will_ come. God never gives great events without great\r\nhistorians; and for all the patience and valor and heroic fortitude and\r\nself-sacrifice and long-suffering of the black man in this war, there\r\nwill come a singer--and a black singer--who shall set his deeds to a\r\nmusic that will thrill the nations.\r\n\r\nBut I am holding the reader at the threshold.\r\n\r\nThe author of this narrative--of every line in it--is William Parker. He\r\nwas an escaped slave, and the principal actor in the Christiana\r\nriot,--an occurrence which cost the Government of the United States\r\nfifty thousand dollars, embittered the relations of two \"Sovereign\r\nStates,\" aroused the North to the danger of the Fugitive-Slave Law, and,\r\nmore than any other event, except the raid of John Brown, helped to\r\nprecipitate the two sections into the mighty conflict which has just\r\nbeen decided on the battle-field.\r\n\r\nSurely the man who aided towards such results must be a man, even if his\r\ncomplexion be that of the ace of spades; and what he says in relation to\r\nthe events in which he was an actor, even if it have no romantic\r\ninterest,--which, however, it has to an eminent degree,--must be an\r\nimportant contribution to the history of the time.\r\n\r\nWith these few remarks, I submit the evidence which he gives of the\r\nmanhood of his race to that impartial grand-jury, the American people.\r\nE. K.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY PLANTATION LIFE.\r\n\r\nI was born opposite to Queen Anne, in Anne Arundel County, in the State\r\nof Maryland, on a plantation called Rowdown. My master was Major William\r\nBrogdon, one of the wealthy men of that region. He had two\r\nsons,--William, a doctor, and David, who held some office at Annapolis,\r\nand for some years was a member of the Legislature.\r\n\r\nMy old master died when I was very young; so I know little about him,\r\nexcept from statements received from my fellow-slaves, or casual remarks\r\nmade in my hearing from time to time by white persons. From those I\r\nconclude that he was in no way peculiar, but should be classed with\r\nthose slaveholders who are not remarkable either for the severity or the\r\nindulgence they extend to their people.\r\n\r\nMy mother, who was named Louisa Simms, died when I was very young; and\r\nto my grandmother I am indebted for the very little kindness I received\r\nin my early childhood; and this kindness could only be shown me at long\r\nintervals, and in a hurried way, as I shall presently show.\r\n\r\nLike every Southern plantation of respectable extent and pretensions,\r\nour place had what is called the \"Quarter,\" or place where the slaves of\r\nboth sexes are lodged and fed. With us the Quarter was composed of a\r\nnumber of low buildings, with an additional building for single people\r\nand such of the children as were either orphans or had parents sold away\r\nor otherwise disposed of. This building was a hundred feet long by\r\nthirty wide, and had a large fireplace at either end, and small rooms\r\narranged along the sides. In these rooms the children were huddled from\r\nday to day, the smaller and weaker subject to the whims and caprices of\r\nthe larger and stronger. The largest children would always seize upon\r\nthe warmest and best places, and say to us who were smaller, \"Stand\r\nback, little chap, out of my way\"; and we had to stand back or get a\r\nthrashing.\r\n\r\nWhen my grandmother, who was cook at the \"great house,\" came to look\r\nafter me, she always brought me a morsel privately; and at such times I\r\nwas entirely free from annoyance by the older ones. But as she could\r\nvisit me only once in twenty-four hours, my juvenile days enjoyed but\r\nlittle rest from my domineering superiors in years and strength.\r\n\r\nWhen my grandmother would inquire of the others how her \"little boy\" was\r\ngetting on, they would tell her that I was doing well, and kindly invite\r\nme to the fire to warm myself. I was afraid to complain to her of their\r\ntreatment, as, for so doing, they would have beaten me, after she had\r\ngone to the \"great house\" again. I was thus compelled to submit to their\r\nmisrepresentation, as well as to their abuse and indifference, until I\r\ngrew older, when, by fighting first with one and then with another, I\r\nbecame \"too many\" for them, and could have a seat at the fire as well as\r\nthe best. This experience of my boyhood has since been repeated in my\r\nmanhood. My rights at the fireplace were won by my child-fists; my\r\nrights as a freeman were, under God, secured by my own right arm.\r\n\r\nOld master had seventy slaves, mostly field-hands. My mother was a\r\nfield-hand. He finally died; but after that everything went on as usual\r\nfor about six years, at the end of which time the brothers, David and\r\nWilliam, divided the land and the slaves. Then, with many others,\r\nincluding my brother and uncle, it fell to my lot to go with Master\r\nDavid, who built a house on the southeast part of the farm and called it\r\nNearo.\r\n\r\nOver the hands at Nearo an overseer name Robert Brown was placed; but as\r\nhe was liked by neither master nor slaves, he was soon discharged. The\r\nfollowing circumstance led to his dismissal sooner, perhaps, than it\r\nwould otherwise have happened.\r\n\r\nWhile master was at Annapolis, my mistress, who was hard to please, fell\r\nout with one of the house-servants, and sent for Mr. Brown to come and\r\nwhip her. When he came, the girl refused to be whipped, which angered\r\nBrown, and he beat her so badly that she was nearly killed before she\r\ngave up. When Master David came home, and saw the girl's condition, he\r\nbecame very angry, and turned Brown away at once.\r\n\r\nMaster David owned a colored man named Bob Wallace. He was a trusty man;\r\nand as he understood farming thoroughly, he was installed foreman in\r\nplace of Brown. Everything went on very well for a while under Wallace,\r\nand the slaves were as contented as it is possible for slaves to be.\r\n\r\nNeither of our young masters would allow his hands to be beaten or\r\nabused, as many slaveholders would; but every year they sold one or more\r\nof them,--sometimes as many as six or seven at a time. One morning word\r\nwas brought to the Quarter that we should not work that day, but group\r\nto the \"great house.\" As we were about obeying the summons, a number of\r\nstrange white men rode up to the mansion. They were Negro-traders.\r\nTaking alarm, I ran away to the woods with a boy of about my own age,\r\nname Levi Storax; and there we remained until the selections for the\r\nsale were made, and the traders drove away. It was a serious time while\r\nthey remained. Men, women, and children, all were crying, and general\r\nconfusion prevailed. For years they had associated together in their\r\nrude way,--the old counseling the young, recounting their experience,\r\nand sympathizing in their trials; and now, without a word of warning,\r\nand for no fault of their own, parents and children, husbands and wives,\r\nbrothers and sisters, were separated to meet no more on earth. A slave\r\nsale of this sort is always as solemn as a funeral, and partakes of its\r\nnature in one important particular,--the meeting no more in the flesh.\r\n\r\nLevi and I climbed a pine-tree, when we got to the woods, and had this\r\nconversation together.\r\n\r\n\"Le,\" I said to him, \"our turn will come next; let us run away, and not\r\nbe sold like the rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we can only get clear this time,\" replied Le, \"may-be they won't\r\nsell us. I will go to Master William, and ask him not to do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What will you get by going to Master William?\" I asked him. \"If we see\r\nhim, and ask him not to sell us, he will do as he pleases. For my part,\r\nI think the best thing is to run away to the Free States.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" replied Levi, \"see how many start for the Free States, and are\r\nbrought back, and sold away down South. We could not be safe this side\r\nof Canada, and we should freeze to death before we got there.\"\r\n\r\nSo ended our conversation. I must have been about ten or eleven years\r\nold then; yet, young as I was, I had heard of Canada as the land far\r\naway in the North, where the runaway was safe from pursuit; but, to my\r\nimagination, it was a vast and cheerless waste of ice and snow. So the\r\nreader can readily conceive of the effect of Levi's remarks. They were a\r\ndamper upon our flight for the time being.\r\n\r\nWhen night came, Levi wanted to go home and see if they had sold his\r\nmother; but I did not care about going back, as I had no mother to sell.\r\nHow desolate I was! No home, no protector, no mother, no attachments. As\r\nwe turned our faces toward the Quarter,--where we might at any moment be\r\nsold to satisfy a debt or replenish a failing purse,--I felt myself to\r\nbe what I really was, a poor, friendless slave-boy. Levi was equally\r\nsad. His mother was not sold, but she could afford him no protection.\r\n\r\nTo the question, \"Where had we been?\" we answered, \"Walking around.\"\r\nThen followed inquiries and replies as to who were sold, who remained,\r\nand what transpired at the sale.\r\n\r\nSaid Levi,--\r\n\r\n\"Mother, were you sold?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, child; but a good many were sold; among them, your Uncles Anthony\r\nand Dennis.\"\r\n\r\nI said,--\r\n\r\n\"Aunt Ruthy, did they sell Uncle Sammy?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, child.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where, then, is Uncle Sammy?\"\r\n\r\nI thought, if I could be with Uncle Sammy, may-be I would be safe. My\r\nAunt Rachel, and her two children, Jacob and Priscilla, were among the\r\nsold, who altogether comprised a large number of the servants.\r\n\r\nThe apologist for slavery at the North, and the owner of his fellow-man\r\nat the South, have steadily denied that the separation of families,\r\nexcept for punishment, was perpetrated by Southern masters; but my\r\nexperience of slavery was, that separation by sale was a part of the\r\nsystem. Not only was it resorted to by severe masters, but, as in my own\r\ncase, by those generally regarded as mild. No punishment was so much\r\ndreaded by the refractory slave as selling. The atrocities known to be\r\ncommitted on plantations in the Far South, tidings of which reached the\r\nslave's ears in various ways, his utter helplessness upon the best farms\r\nand under the most humane masters and overseers, in Maryland and other\r\nNorthern Slave States, together with the impression that the journey was\r\nof great extent, and comfortless even to a slave, all combined to make a\r\nvoyage down the river or down South an era in the life of the poor slave\r\nto which he looked forward with the most intense and bitter apprehension\r\nand anxiety.\r\n\r\nThis slave sale was the first I had ever seen. The next did not occur\r\nuntil I was thirteen years old; but every year, during the interval, one\r\nor more poor souls were disposed of privately.\r\n\r\nLevi, my comrade, was one of those sold in this interval. Well may the\r\ngood John Wesley speak of slavery as the sum of all villanies; for no\r\nresort is too despicable, no subterfuge too vile, for its supporters. Is\r\na slave intractable, the most wicked punishment is not too severe; is he\r\ntimid, obedient, attached to his birthplace and kindred, no lie is so\r\nbase that it may not be used to entrap him into a change of place or of\r\nowners. Levi was made the victim of a stratagem so peculiarly Southern,\r\nand so thoroughly the outgrowth of an institution which holds the bodies\r\nand souls of men as of no more account, for all moral purposes, than the\r\nunreasoning brutes, that I cannot refrain from relating it. He was a\r\nlikely lad, and, to all appearance, fully in the confidence of his\r\nmaster. Prompt and obedient, he seemed to some of us to enjoy high favor\r\nat the \"great house.\" One morning he was told to take a letter to Mr.\r\nHenry Hall, an acquaintance of the family; and it being a part of his\r\nusual employment to bring and carry such missives, off he started, in\r\nblind confidence, to learn at the end of his journey that he had parted\r\nwith parents, friends, and all, to find in Mr. Hall a new master. Thus,\r\nin a moment, his dearest ties were severed.\r\n\r\nI met him about two months afterwards at the Cross-Road Meeting-House,\r\non West River; and, after mutual recognition, I said to him,--\r\n\r\n\"Levi, why don't you come home?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am at home,\" said he; \"I was sold by Master William to Mr. Henry\r\nHall.\"\r\n\r\nHe then told me about the deception practised upon him. I thought that a\r\nsuitable opportunity to remind him of our conversation when up the\r\npine-tree, years before, and said,--\r\n\r\n\"You told me, that, if you could escape the big sale, Master William\r\nwould not sell you. Now you see how it was: the big sale was over, and\r\nyet you were sold to a worse master than you had before. I told you this\r\nwould be so. The next time I hear from you, you will be sold again.\r\nMaster Mack will be selling me one of these days, no doubt; but if he\r\ndoes, he will have to do it running.\"\r\n\r\nHere ended our conversation and our association, as it was not in our\r\npower to meet afterward.\r\n\r\nThe neighbors generally called Master David, Mack, which was one of his\r\nChristian names; and the slaves called him Master Mack; so the reader\r\nwill understand, that, whenever that name occurs, Master David is meant.\r\n\r\nAfter the sale of Levi, I became greatly attached to Alexander Brown,\r\nanother slave. Though not permitted to learn to read and write, and kept\r\nin profound ignorance of everything, save what belonged strictly to our\r\nplantation duties, we were not without crude perceptions of the dignity\r\nand independence belonging to freedom; and often, when out of hearing of\r\nthe white people, or certain ones among our fellow-servants, Alexander\r\nand I would talk the subject over in our simple way.\r\n\r\nMaster Mack had a very likely young house-servant named Ann. She was\r\nbetween sixteen and eighteen years old; every one praised her\r\nintelligence and industry; but these commendable characteristics did not\r\nsave her. She was sold next after Levi. Master told the foreman, Bob\r\nWallace, to go to Annapolis, and take Ann with him. When Wallace told me\r\nhe was going, I had a presentiment that the purpose was to sell the\r\ngirl, and I told him so; but, man as he was, he had no fear about it.\r\nWallace and Ann started for the city on horseback, and journeyed along\r\npleasantly until they reached the town and were near the market-place,\r\nwhen a man came up to them, took Ann off the horse without ceremony, and\r\nput her into jail. Wallace, not suspecting the manoeuvre, attacked the\r\nman, and came well-nigh getting into difficulty. When Wallace returned,\r\nhe said to Master Mack, \"Why did you not tell me that Ann was sold, and\r\nnot have me fighting for her? They might have put me in jail.\" But his\r\nmaster did not appear to hear him.\r\n\r\nPoor Uncle Henry followed Ann. His wife lived in Annapolis, and belonged\r\nto a Mr. George McNear, residing there. Uncle Henry went one Saturday\r\nnight to see her, when Master William put him into jail for sale; and\r\nthat was the last we saw or heard of him.\r\n\r\nAlex Brown's mother followed next. After the poor woman was gone, I said\r\nto Alex,--\r\n\r\n\"Now that your mother has been sold, it is time that you and I studied\r\nout a plan to run away and be free.\"\r\n\r\nBut so thoroughly had his humanity been crushed by the foul spirit of\r\nSlavery, so apathetic had he--though in the vigor of youth--become from\r\nlong oppression, that he would not agree to my suggestion.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he said, \"'t is no use for you and I to run away. It is too far to\r\nthe Free States. We could not get there. They would take us up and sell\r\nus; so we had better not go. Master Mack can't sell any more of his\r\nhands; there are no more than can carry on his farm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said I, \"trust to that, and you will see what will come of\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nAfter that I said no more to him, but determined to be free. My brother\r\nCharles was of like mind; but we kept our thoughts to ourselves. How old\r\nI was then I do not know; but from what the neighbors told me, I must\r\nhave been about seventeen. Slaveholders are particular to keep the\r\npedigree and age of favorite horses and dogs, but are quite indifferent\r\nabout the age of their servants, until they want to purchase. Then they\r\nare careful to select young persons, though not one in twenty can tell\r\nyear, month, or day. Speaking of births,--it is the time of\r\n\"corn-planting,\" \"corn-husking,\" \"Christmas,\" \"New Year,\" \"Easter,\" \"the\r\nFourth of July,\" or some similar indefinite date. My own time of birth\r\nwas no more exact; so that to this day I am uncertain how old I am.\r\n\r\nAbout the time of the conversation last narrated, Jefferson Dorsey, a\r\nplanter near by, had a butchering. One of Dorsey's men met me, and said\r\nthat they wanted more help, and that Master Mack said I might go and\r\nlend a hand. Thinking that he spoke truth, I did not ask permission, but\r\nwent, and stayed until noon. I soon learned, however, that the man had\r\ndeceived me.\r\n\r\nMaster Mack, when told by some of the people where I was, sent my\r\nbrother John after me, with the threat of a whipping. On reaching home,\r\nthe women also told me that master would almost kill me. This excited me\r\ngreatly, and I replied,--\r\n\r\n\"Master Mack is 'most done whipping me.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I went in to see him, I saw plainly enough that his face foretold a\r\nstorm.\r\n\r\n\"Boy,\" said he, \"yoke up the oxen, and haul a load of wood.\"\r\n\r\nI went at once, and did the task; but, to my dismay, there he stood at\r\nthe stable. I had to drive near to him; and as he evidently intended to\r\ncatch me, I was all vigilance.\r\n\r\n\"When you unload that wood, come to me, Sir,\" he said.\r\n\r\nI made no reply, but unloaded the wood, left the oxen standing, and\r\nstole away to Dorsey's, where I staid until the next day. Then I\r\nprevailed upon Samuel Dorsey to go home with me. Master Mack told me to\r\ngo to my work, and he would forgive me; but the next time he would pay\r\nme for \"the new and the old.\" To work I went; but I determined not to be\r\npaid for \"the new and the old.\"\r\n\r\nThis all occurred in the month of May. Everything went on well until\r\nJune, when the long-sought-for opportunity presented itself. I had been\r\nmaking preparations to leave ever since Master Mack had threatened me;\r\nyet I did not like to go without first having a difficulty with him.\r\nMuch as I disliked my condition, I was ignorant enough to think that\r\nsomething besides the fact that I was a slave was necessary to exonerate\r\nme from blame in running away. A cross word, a blow, a good fright,\r\nanything, would do, it mattered not whence nor how it came. I told my\r\nbrother Charles, who shared my confidence, to be ready; for the time was\r\nat hand when we should leave Old Maryland forever. I was only waiting\r\nfor the first crooked word from my master.\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards all hands were ordered to the fields to work; but\r\nI stayed behind, lurking about the house. I was tired of working without\r\npay. Master Mack saw me, and wanted to know why I did not go out. I\r\nanswered, that it was raining, that I was tired, and did not want to\r\nwork. He then picked up a stick used for an ox-gad, and said, if I did\r\nnot go to work, he would whip me as sure as there was a God in heaven.\r\nThen he struck at me; but I caught the stick, and we grappled, and\r\nhandled each other roughly for a time, when he called for assistance. He\r\nwas badly hurt. I let go my hold, bade him good-bye, and ran for the\r\nwoods. As I went by the field, I beckoned to my brother, who left work,\r\nand joined me at a rapid pace.\r\n\r\nI was now at the beginning of a new and important era in my life.\r\nAlthough upon the threshold of manhood, I had, until the relation with\r\nmy master was sundered, only dim perceptions of the responsibilities of\r\na more independent position. I longed to cast off the chains of\r\nservitude, because they chafed my free spirit, and because I had a\r\nnotion that my position was founded in injustice; but it has only been\r\nsince a struggle of many years, and, indeed, since I settled upon\r\nBritish soil, that I have realized fully the grandeur of my position as\r\na free man.\r\n\r\nOne fact, when I was a slave, often filled me with indignation. There\r\nwere many poor white lads of about my own age, belonging to families\r\nscattered around, who were as poor in personal effects as we were; and\r\nyet, though our companions, (when we chose to tolerate them,) they did\r\nnot have to be controlled by a master, to go and come at his command, to\r\nbe sold for his debts, or whenever he wanted extra pocket-money. The\r\npreachers of a slave-trading gospel frequently told us, in their\r\nsermons, that we should be \"good boys,\" and not break into master's\r\nhen-roost, nor steal his bacon; but they never told this to these poor\r\nwhite people, although they knew very well that they encouraged the\r\nslaves to steal, trafficked in stolen goods, and stole themselves.\r\n\r\nWhy this difference? I felt I was the equal of these poor whites, and\r\nnaturally I concluded that we were greatly wronged, and that all this\r\ntalk about obedience, duty, humility, and honesty was, in the phrase of\r\nmy companions, \"all gammon.\"\r\n\r\nBut I was now on the high-road to liberty. I had broken the bonds that\r\nheld me so firmly; and now, instead of fears of recapture, that before\r\nhad haunted my imagination whenever I thought of running away, I felt as\r\nlight as a feather, and seemed to be helped onward by an irresistible\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nSome time before this, I had been able, through the instrumentality of a\r\nfriend, to procure a pass, for which I paid five dollars,--all the money\r\nI had saved in a long time; but as my brother determined to go with me,\r\nand as we could not both use it safely, I destroyed it.\r\n\r\nOn the day I ceased working for master, after gaining the woods, we\r\nlurked about and discussed our plans until after dark. Then we stole\r\nback to the Quarter, made up our bundles, bade some of our friends\r\nfarewell, and at about nine o'clock of the night set out for Baltimore.\r\nHow shall I describe my first experience of free life? Nothing can be\r\ngreater than the contrast it affords to a plantation experience, under\r\nthe suspicious and vigilant eye of a mercenary overseer or a watchful\r\nmaster. Day and night are not more unlike. The mandates of Slavery are\r\nlike leaden sounds, sinking with dead weight into the very soul, only to\r\ndeaden and destroy. The impulse of freedom lends wings to the feet,\r\nbuoys up the spirit within, and the fugitive catches glorious glimpses\r\nof light through rifts and seams in the accumulated ignorance of his\r\nyears of oppression. How briskly we travelled on that eventful night and\r\nthe next day!\r\n\r\nWe reached Baltimore on the following evening, between seven and eight\r\no'clock. When we neared the city, the patrols were out, and the\r\ndifficulty was to pass them unseen or unsuspected. I learned of a\r\nbrick-yard at the entrance to the city; and thither we went at once,\r\ntook brick-dust and threw it upon our clothes, hats, and boots, and then\r\nwalked on. Whenever we met a passer-by, we would brush off some of the\r\ndust, and say aloud, \"Boss gave us such big tasks, we would leave him.\r\nWe ought to have been in a long time before.\" By this ruse we reached\r\nquiet quarters without arrest or suspicion.\r\n\r\nWe remained in Baltimore a week, and then set out for Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nWe started with the brightest visions of future independence; but soon\r\nthey were suddenly dimmed by one of those unpleasant incidents which\r\nannoy the fugitive at every step of his onward journey.\r\n\r\nThe first place at which we stopped to rest was a village on the old\r\nYork road, called New Market. There nothing occurred to cause us alarm;\r\nso, after taking some refreshments, we proceeded towards York; but when\r\nnear Logansville, we were interrupted by three white men, one of whom, a\r\nvery large man, cried,--\r\n\r\n\"Hallo!\"\r\n\r\nI answered,--\r\n\r\n\"Hallo to you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Which way are you travelling?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nWe replied,--\r\n\r\n\"To Little York.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why are you travelling so late?\"\r\n\r\n\"We are not later than you are,\" I answered.\r\n\r\n\"Your business must be of consequence,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"It is. We want to go to York to attend to it; and if you have any\r\nbusiness, please attend to it, and don't be meddling with ours on the\r\npublic highway. We have no business with you, and I am sure you have\r\nnone with us.\"\r\n\r\n\"See here!\" said he; \"you are the fellows that this advertisement calls\r\nfor,\" at the same time taking the paper out of his pocket, and reading\r\nit to us.\r\n\r\nSure enough, there we were, described exactly. He came closely to us,\r\nand said,--\r\n\r\n\"You must go back.\"\r\n\r\nI replied,--\r\n\r\n\"If I must, I must, and you must take me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you need not make any big talk about it,\" he answered; \"for I have\r\ntaken back many a runaway, and I can take you. What's that you have in\r\nyour hand?\"\r\n\r\n\"A stick.\"\r\n\r\nHe put his hand into his pocket, as if to draw a pistol, and said,--\r\n\r\n\"Come! give up your weapons.\"\r\n\r\nI said again,--\r\n\r\n\"'Tis only a stick.\"\r\n\r\nHe then reached for it, when I stepped back and struck him a heavy blow\r\non the arm. It fell as if broken; I think it was. Then he turned and\r\nran, and I after him. As he ran, he would look back over his shoulder,\r\nsee me coming, and then run faster, and halloo with all his might. I\r\ncould not catch him, and it seemed, that, the longer he ran, the faster\r\nhe went. The other two took to their heels at the first alarm,--thus\r\nillustrating the valor of the chivalry!\r\n\r\nAt last I gave up the chase. The whole neighborhood by that time was\r\naroused, and we thought best to retrace our steps to the place whence we\r\nstarted. Then we took a roundabout course until we reached the railroad,\r\nalong which we travelled. For a long distance there was unusual stir and\r\ncommotion. Every house was lighted up; and we heard people talking and\r\nhorses galloping this way and that way, with other evidences of unusual\r\nexcitement. This was between one and two o'clock in the morning. We\r\nwalked on a long distance before we lost the sounds; but about four\r\no'clock the same morning, entered York, where we remained during the\r\nday.\r\n\r\nOnce in York, we thought we should be safe, but were mistaken. A similar\r\nmistake is often made by fugitives. Not accustomed to travelling, and\r\nunacquainted with the facilities for communication, they think that a\r\nfew hours' walk is a long journey, and foolishly suppose, that, if they\r\nhave few opportunities of knowledge, their masters can have none at all\r\nat such great distances. But our ideas of security were materially\r\nlessened when we met with a friend during the day, who advised us to\r\nproceed farther, as we were not out of imminent danger.\r\n\r\nAccording to this advice we started that night for Columbia. Going along\r\nin the dark, we heard persons following. We went very near to the fence,\r\nthat they might pass without observing us. There were two, apparently in\r\nearnest conversation. The one who spoke so as to be distinctly heard we\r\ndiscovered to be Master Mack's brother-in-law. He remarked to his\r\ncompanion that they must hurry and get to the bridge before we crossed.\r\nHe knew that we had not gone over yet. We were then near enough to have\r\nkilled them, concealed as we were by the darkness; but we permitted\r\nthem to pass unmolested, and went on to Wrightsville that night.\r\n\r\nThe next morning we arrived at Columbia before it was light, and\r\nfortunately without crossing the bridge, for we were taken over in a\r\nboat. At Wrightsville we met a woman with whom we were before\r\nacquainted, and our meeting was very gratifying. We there inclined to\r\nhalt for a time.\r\n\r\nI was not used to living in town, and preferred a home in the country;\r\nso to the country we decided to go. After resting for four days, we\r\nstarted towards Lancaster to try to procure work. I got a place about\r\nfive miles from Lancaster, and then set to work in earnest.\r\n\r\nWhile a slave, I was, as it were, groping in the dark, no ray of light\r\npenetrating the intense gloom surrounding me. My scanty garments felt\r\ntoo tight for me, my very respiration seemed to be restrained by some\r\nsupernatural power. Now, free as I supposed, I felt like a bird on a\r\npleasant May morning. Instead of the darkness of slavery, my eyes were\r\nalmost blinded by the light of freedom.\r\n\r\nThose were memorable days, and yet much of this was boyish fancy. After\r\na few years of life in a Free State, the enthusiasm of the lad\r\nmaterially sobered down, and I found, by bitter experience, that to\r\npreserve my stolen liberty I must pay, unremittingly, an almost\r\nsleepless vigilance; yet to this day I have never looked back\r\nregretfully to Old Maryland, nor yearned for her flesh-pots.\r\n\r\nI have said I engaged to work; I hired my services for three months for\r\nthe round sum of three dollars per month. I thought this an immense sum.\r\nFast work was no trouble to me; for when the work was done, the money\r\nwas mine. That was a great consideration. I could go out on Saturdays\r\nand Sundays, and home when I pleased, without being whipped. I thought\r\nof my fellow-servants left behind, bound in the chains of slavery,--and\r\nI was free! I thought, that, if I had the power, they should soon be as\r\nfree as I was; and I formed a resolution that I would assist in\r\nliberating every one within my reach at the risk of my life, and that I\r\nwould devise some plan for their entire liberation.\r\n\r\nMy brother went about fifteen miles farther on, and also got employment.\r\nI \"put in\" three months with my employer, \"lifted\" my wages, and then\r\nwent to visit my brother. He lived in Bart Township, near Smyrna; and\r\nafter my visit was over, I engaged to work for a Dr. Dengy, living\r\nnearby. I remained with him thirteen months. I never have been better\r\ntreated than by the Doctor; I liked him and the family, and they seemed\r\nto think well of me.\r\n\r\nWhile living with Dr. Dengy, I had, for the first time, the great\r\nprivilege of seeing that true friend of the slave, William Lloyd\r\nGarrison, who came into the neighborhood, accompanied by Frederick\r\nDouglass. They were holding anti-slavery meetings. I shall never forget\r\nthe impression that Garrison's glowing words made upon me. I had\r\nformerly known Mr. Douglass as a slave in Maryland; I was therefore not\r\nprepared for the progress he then showed,--neither for his free-spoken\r\nand manly language against slavery. I listened with the intense\r\nsatisfaction that only a refugee could feel, when hearing, embodied in\r\nearnest, well-chosen, and strong speech, his own crude ideas of freedom,\r\nand his own hearty censure of the man-stealer. I believed, I knew, every\r\nword he said was true. It was the whole truth,--nothing kept back,--no\r\ntrifling with human rights, no trading in the blood of the slave\r\nextenuated, nothing against the slaveholder said in malice. I have never\r\nlistened to words from the lips of mortal man which were more acceptable\r\nto me; and although privileged since then to hear many able and good men\r\nspeak on slavery, no doctrine has seemed to me so pure, so unworldly, as\r\nhis. I may here say, and without offence, I trust, that, since that\r\ntime, I have had a long experience of Garrisonian Abolitionists, and\r\nhave always found them men and women with hearts in their bodies. They\r\nare, indeed and in truth, the poor slave's friend. To shelter him, to\r\nfeed and clothe him, to help him on to freedom, I have ever found them\r\nready; and I should be wanting in gratitude, if I neglected this\r\nopportunity--the only one I may ever have--to say thus much of them, and\r\nto declare for myself and for the many colored men in this free country\r\nwhom I know they have aided in their journey to freedom, our humble\r\nconfidence in them. Yes, the good spirit with which he is imbued\r\nconstrained William Lloyd Garrison to plead for the dumb; and for his\r\nearnest pleadings all these years, I say, God bless him! By agitation,\r\nby example, by suffering, men and women of like spirit have been led to\r\nadopt his views, as the great necessity, and to carry them out into\r\nactions. They, too, have my heartfelt gratitude. They, like Gideon's\r\nband, though few, will yet rout the enemy Slavery, make him flee his own\r\ncamp, and eventually fall upon his own sword.[F]\r\n\r\nOne day, while living at Dr. Dengy's, I was working in the barn-yard,\r\nwhen a man came to the fence, and, looking at me intently, went away.\r\nThe Doctor's son, observing him, said,--\r\n\r\n\"Parker, that man, from his movements, must be a slaveholder or\r\nkidnapper. This is the second time he has been looking at you. If not a\r\nkidnapper, why does he look so steadily at you and not tell his errand?\"\r\n\r\nI said,--\r\n\r\n\"The man must be a fool! If he should come back and not say anything to\r\nme, I shall say something to him.\"\r\n\r\nWe then looked down the road and saw him coming again. He rode up to the\r\nsame place and halted. I then went to the fence, and, looking him\r\nsteadily in the eye, said,--\r\n\r\n\"Am I your slave?\"\r\n\r\nHe made no reply, but turned his horse and rode off, at full speed,\r\ntowards the valley. We did not see him again; but that same evening word\r\nwas brought that kidnappers were in the valley, and if we were not\r\ncareful, they would \"hook\" some of us. This caused a great excitement\r\namong the colored people of the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nA short while prior to this, a number of us had formed an organization\r\nfor mutual protection against slaveholders and kidnappers, and had\r\nresolved to prevent any of our brethren being taken back into slavery,\r\nat the risk of our own lives. We collected together that evening, and\r\nwent down to the valley; but the kidnappers had gone. We watched them\r\nfor several nights in succession, without result; for so much alarmed\r\nwere the tavern-keepers by our demonstration, that they refused to let\r\nthem stop over night with them. Kidnapping was so common, while I lived\r\nwith the Doctor, that we were kept in constant fear. We would hear of\r\nslaveholders or kidnappers every two or three weeks; sometimes a party\r\nof white men would break into a house and take a man away, no one knew\r\nwhere; and, again, a whole family would be carried off. There was no\r\npower to protect them, nor prevent it. So completely roused were my\r\nfeelings, that I vowed to let no slaveholder take back a fugitive, if I\r\ncould but get my eye on him.\r\n\r\nOne day word was sent to me that slaveholders had taken William Dorsey,\r\nand had put him into Lancaster jail to await a trial. Dorsey had a wife\r\nand three or four children; but what was it to the slaveholder, if the\r\nwife and children should starve? We consulted together, as to what\r\ncourse to take to deliver him; but no plan that was proposed could be\r\nworked. At last we separated, determining to get him away some way or\r\nother on the day of trial. His case caused great excitement. We attended\r\nthe trial, and eagerly watched all the movements from an outside\r\nposition, and had a man to tell us how proceedings were going on within.\r\nHe finally came out and said that the case would go against Dorsey. We\r\nthen formed in a column at the court-house door, and when the\r\nslaveholders and Dorsey came out, we walked close to them,--behind and\r\naround them,--trying to separate them from him. Before we had gone far\r\ntowards the jail, a slaveholder drew a pistol on Williams Hopkins, one\r\nof our party. Hopkins defied him to shoot; but he did not. Then the\r\nslaveholder drew the pistol on me, saying, he would blow my black brains\r\nout, if I did not go away. I doubled my fists to knock him down, but\r\nsome person behind caught my hand; this started a fracas, and we got\r\nDorsey loose; but he was so confused that he stood stock still, until\r\nthey tied him again. A general fight followed. Bricks, stones, and\r\nsticks fell in showers. We fought across the road and back again, and I\r\nthought our brains would be knocked out; when the whites, who were too\r\nnumerous for us, commenced making arrests. They got me fast several\r\ntimes, but I succeeded in getting away. One of our men was arrested, and\r\nafterwards stood trial; but they did not convict him. Dorsey was put\r\ninto jail, but was afterwards bought and liberated by friends.\r\n\r\nMy friends now said that I had got myself into a bad difficulty, and\r\nthat my arrest would follow. In this they were mistaken. I never was\r\ndisturbed because of it, nor was the house at which I lodged ever\r\nsearched, although the neighbors were repeatedly annoyed in that way. I\r\ndistinctly remember that this was the second time that resistance had\r\nbeen made to their wicked deeds. Whether the kidnappers were clothed\r\nwith legal authority or not, I did not care to inquire, as I never had\r\nfaith in nor respect for the Fugitive-Slave Law.\r\n\r\nThe whites of that region were generally such negro-haters, that it was\r\na matter of no moment to them where fugitives were carried,--whether to\r\nLancaster, Harrisburg, or elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe insolent and overbearing conduct of the Southerners, when on such\r\nerrands to Pennsylvania, forced me to my course of action. They did not\r\nhesitate to break open doors, and to enter, without ceremony, the houses\r\nof colored men; and when refused admission, or when a manly and\r\ndetermined spirit was shown, they would present pistols, and strike and\r\nknock down men and women indiscriminately.\r\n\r\nI was sitting one evening in a friend's house, conversing about these\r\nmarauding parties, when I remarked to him that a stop should be put to\r\nsuch \"didos,\" and declared, that, the next time a slaveholder came to a\r\nhouse where I was, I would refuse to admit him. His wife replied, \"It\r\nwill make a fuss.\" I told her, \"It is time a fuss was made.\" She\r\ninsisted that it would cause trouble, and it was best to let them alone\r\nand have peace. Then I told her we must have trouble before we could\r\nhave peace, \"The first slaveholder that draws a pistol on me I shall\r\nknock down.\"\r\n\r\nWe were interrupted, just at this stage of the conversation, by some one\r\nrapping at the door.\r\n\r\n\"Who's there?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"It's me! Who do you think? Open the door!\" was the response, in a gruff\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nWithout replying, the man opened the door and came in, followed by two\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe first one said,--\r\n\r\n\"Have you any niggers here?\"\r\n\r\n\"What have we to do with your niggers?\" said I.\r\n\r\nAfter bandying a few words, he drew his pistol upon me. Before he could\r\nbring the weapon to bear, I seized a pair of heavy tongs, and struck him\r\na violent blow across the face and neck, which knocked him down. He lay\r\nfor a few minutes senseless, but afterwards rose, and walked out of the\r\nhouse without a word, followed by his comrades, who also said nothing to\r\nus, but merely asked their leader, as they went out, if he was hurt.\r\n\r\nThe part of Lancaster County in which I lived was near Chester County.\r\nNot far away, in the latter county, lived Moses Whitson, a well-known\r\nAbolitionist, and a member of the Society of Friends. Mr. Whitson had a\r\ncolored girl living in his family, who was pounced upon by the\r\nslaveholders, awhile after the Dorsey arrest. About daylight three men\r\nwent to Mr. Whitson's house and told him that the girl he had living\r\nwith him was their property, and that they intended to have her. Friend\r\nWhitson asked the girl if she knew any of the men, and if any of them\r\nwas her master. She said, \"No!\" One of the slaveholders said he could\r\nprove that she was his property; and then they forcibly tied her, put\r\nher into a carriage, and started for Maryland.\r\n\r\nWhile the kidnappers were contending with Moses Whitson for the girl,\r\nBenjamin Whipper, a colored man, who now lives in this country, sounded\r\nthe alarm, that \"the kidnappers were at Whitson's, and were taking away\r\nhis girl.\" The news soon reached me, and with six or seven others, I\r\nfollowed them. We proceeded with all speed to a place called the\r\nGap-Hill, where we overtook them, and took the girl away. Then we beat\r\nthe kidnappers, and let them go. We learned afterwards that they were\r\nall wounded badly, and that two of them died in Lancaster, and the other\r\ndid not get home for some time. Only one of our men was hurt, and he had\r\nonly a slight injury in the hand.\r\n\r\nDr. Duffield and Squire Henderson, two respectable citizens of the town,\r\nwere looking on during this entire engagement; and after we had stopped\r\nfiring, they went up to the slaveholders, and the following conversation\r\ntook place:--\r\n\r\n_Squire Henderson._ What's the matter?\r\n\r\n_Slaveholder._ You may ask, what's the matter! Is this the way you allow\r\nyour niggers to do?\r\n\r\n_Squire._ Why did you not shoot them?\r\n\r\n_Slaveholder._ We did shoot at them, but it did not take effect.\r\n\r\n_Squire._ There's no use shooting at our niggers, for their heads are\r\nlike iron pots; the balls will glance off. What were you doing?\r\n\r\n_Slaveholder._ Taking our property, when the niggers jumped on us and\r\nnearly killed some of the men.\r\n\r\n_Squire._ Men coming after such property ought to be killed.\r\n\r\n_Slaveholder._ Do you know where we can find a doctor?\r\n\r\n_Squire._ Yes; there are plenty of doctors South.\r\n\r\nBeing much disabled, and becoming enraged, they abruptly left, and\r\njourneyed on until they reached McKenzie's tavern, where their wounds\r\nwere dressed and their wants attended to. So strongly was McKenzie in\r\nsympathy with these demons, that he declared he would never employ\r\nanother nigger, and actually discharged a faithful colored woman who had\r\nlived a long time in his employ. Dr. Lemmon, a physician on the road to\r\nLancaster, refused to attend the slaveholders; so that by the time they\r\ngot to the city, from being so long without surgical aid, their limbs\r\nwere past setting, and two of them died, as before stated, while the\r\nother survived but a short time after reaching Maryland.\r\n\r\nA large reward was offered by the Maryland authorities for the\r\nperpetrators of the flogging, but without effect.\r\n\r\nMcKenzie, the tavern-keeper referred to, boasted after this that he\r\nwould entertain all slaveholders who came along, and help them recapture\r\ntheir slaves. We were equally determined he should not, if we could\r\nprevent it.\r\n\r\nThe following affliction was eventually the means, under Providence, by\r\nwhich he was led to adopt other views, and become a practical\r\nAbolitionist.\r\n\r\nA band of five men stood off, one dark night, and saw with evident\r\nsatisfaction the curling flames ascend above his barn, from girder to\r\nroof, and lap and lash their angry tongues in wild license, until every\r\nvestige of the building was consumed.\r\n\r\nAfter that mysterious occurrence, the poor fugitive had no better friend\r\nthan the publican McKenzie.\r\n\r\nShortly after the incidents just related, I was married to Eliza Ann\r\nElizabeth Howard, a fugitive, whose experience of slavery had been much\r\nmore bitter than my own. We commenced house-keeping, renting a room from\r\nEnoch Johnson for one month. We did not like our landlord, and when the\r\ntime was up left, and rented a house of Isaac Walker for one year. After\r\nthe year was out, we left Walker's and went to Smyrna, and there I\r\nrented a house from Samuel D. Moore for another year. After the year was\r\nout we left Smyrna also, and went to Joseph Moore's to live. We lived on\r\nhis place about five years. While we were living there, several\r\nkidnappers came into the neighborhood. On one occasion, they took a\r\ncolored man and started for Maryland. Seven of us set out in pursuit,\r\nand, soon getting on their track, followed them to a tavern on the\r\nWestchester road, in Chester County. Learning that they were to remain\r\nfor the night, I went to the door and asked for admittance. The landlord\r\ndemanded to know if we were white or colored. I told him colored. He\r\nthen told us to be gone, or he would blow out our brains. We walked\r\naside a little distance, and consulted about what we should do. Our men\r\nseemed to dread the undertaking; but I told them we could overcome them,\r\nand that I would go in. One of them said he would follow at the risk of\r\nhis life. The other five said we should all get killed,--that we were\r\nmen with families,--that our wives and children needed our\r\nassistance,--and that they did not think we would be doing our families\r\njustice by risking our lives for one man. We two then went back to the\r\ntavern, and, after rapping, were told again by the landlord to clear\r\nout, after he found that we were colored. I pretended that we wanted\r\nsomething to drink. He put his head out of the window, and threatened\r\nagain to shoot us; when my comrade raised his gun and would have shot\r\nhim down, had I not caught his arm and persuaded him not to fire. I told\r\nthe landlord that we wanted to come in and intended to come in. Then I\r\nwent to the yard, got a piece of scantling, took it to the door, and, by\r\nbattering with it a short time, opened it. As soon as the door flew\r\nopen, a kidnapper shot at us, and the ball lodged in my ankle, bringing\r\nme to the ground. But I soon rose, and my comrade then firing on them,\r\nthey took to their heels. As they ran away, I heard one say, \"We have\r\nkilled one of them.\"\r\n\r\nMy companion and I then rushed into the house. We unbound the man, took\r\nhim out, and started for home; but had hardly crossed the door-sill\r\nbefore people from the neighboring houses began to fire on us. At this\r\njuncture, our other five came up, and we all returned the compliment.\r\nFiring on both sides was kept up for ten or fifteen minutes, when the\r\nwhites called for quarter, and offered to withdraw, if we would stop\r\nfiring. On this assurance we started off with the man, and reached home\r\nsafely.\r\n\r\nThe next day my ankle was very painful. With a knife I extracted the\r\nball, but kept the wound secret; as long before we had learned that for\r\nour own security it was best not to let such things be generally known.\r\n\r\nAbout ten o'clock of a Sabbath night, awhile after the event last\r\nnarrated, we were aroused by the cry of \"Kidnappers! kidnappers!\" and\r\nimmediately some one halloed under my window,--\r\n\r\n\"William! William!\"\r\n\r\nI put my head out and demanded his errand. He said,--\r\n\r\n\"Come here!\"\r\n\r\nI answered,--\r\n\r\n\"You must be a fool to think I am going to you at this time of the\r\nnight, without knowing who you are and what you want.\"\r\n\r\nHe would not satisfy me, so I took my gun, and went out to him. I was\r\nthen informed that kidnappers had been at Allen Williams's; that they\r\nhad taken Henry Williams, and gone towards Maryland. I called one of our\r\nparty, who dressed and proceeded to arouse our men. Two of us then\r\nstarted for the Nine Points, in Lancaster County, and left instructions\r\nfor the other men to meet us in the valley. They did so, and we hurried\r\non to our destination. We had not gone far before we heard some one\r\ncalling, \"Kidnappers! kidnappers!\" Going back some distance, we found\r\nthe cry came from a man who had fallen into a lime quarry. He was in a\r\nbad situation, and unable to get out without assistance, and, hearing us\r\npass, concluded we were kidnappers and raised the cry. We were delayed\r\nfor a time in helping him out, and it provoked me very much, as it was\r\nimportant we should be in haste.\r\n\r\nWe started again for the Nine Points, but, arriving there, learned to\r\nour dismay, that the kidnappers had passed an hour before. The chase was\r\ngiven up, but with saddened feelings. A fellow-being had been dragged\r\ninto hopeless bondage, and we, his comrades, held our liberty as\r\ninsecurely as he had done but a few short hours before! We asked\r\nourselves the question, \"Whose turn will come next?\" I was delegated to\r\nfind out, if possible, who had betrayed him, which I accordingly did.\r\n\r\nLynch law is a code familiar to the colored people of the Slave States.\r\nIt is of so diabolical a character as to be without justification,\r\nexcept when enforced by men of pure motives, and then only in extreme\r\ncases, as when the unpunished party has it in his power to barter away\r\nthe lives and liberties of those whose confidence he possesses, and who\r\nwould, by bringing him before a legal tribunal, expose themselves to the\r\nsame risks that they are liable to from him. The frequent attacks from\r\nslaveholders and their tools, the peculiarity of our position, many\r\nbeing escaped slaves, and the secrecy attending these kidnapping\r\nexploits, all combined to make an appeal to the Lynch Code in our case\r\nexcusable, if not altogether justifiable. Ourselves, our wives, our\r\nlittle ones, were insecure, and all we had was liable to seizure. We\r\nfelt that something must be done, for some one must be in our midst with\r\nwhom the slaveholders had communication. I inquired around, quietly, and\r\nsoon learned that Allen Williams, the very man in whose house the\r\nfugitive was, had betrayed him. This information I communicated to our\r\nmen. They met at my house and talked the matter over, and, after most\r\nsolemnly weighing all the facts and evidence, we resolved that he should\r\ndie, and we set about executing our purpose that evening. The difficulty\r\nwas, how to punish him. Some were for shooting him, but this was not\r\nfeasible. I proposed another plan, which was agreed to.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we went to his house and asked if a man named Carter, who\r\nlived with him, was at home, as rumor said that he had betrayed Henry\r\nWilliams. He denied it, and said that Carter had fought for Henry with\r\nhim, but the slaveholders being too strong for them, they had to give\r\nhim up. He kept beyond reach, and the men apologized for intruding upon\r\nhim, while I stepped up to the door and asked for a glass of water. He\r\ngave it to me, and to the others. When he was giving water to one of the\r\nparty, I caught him by the throat, to prevent his giving the alarm, and\r\ndrew him over my head and shoulders. Then the rest beat him until we\r\nthought we heard some one coming, which caused us to flee. If we had not\r\nbeen interrupted, death would have been his fate. At that time I was\r\nattending a threshing-machine for George Whitson and Joseph Scarlot.\r\n\r\nIt must have been a month after the Williams affray, that I was sitting\r\nat home one evening, talking with Pinckney and Samuel Thompson about how\r\nI was getting on with my work, when I thought I heard some one call my\r\nname. I went out, but all was quiet. When I went in, Pinckney and\r\nThompson laughed at me, and said that I had become so \"scary\" that I\r\ncould not stay in the house. But I was not satisfied. I was sure some\r\none had called me. I said so, and that I would go to Marsh Chamberlain's\r\nto see if anything was wrong. They concluded to go also, and we started.\r\n\r\nArriving near the house, I told Pinckney and Thompson to stop outside,\r\nand I would go in, and if anything was wrong, would call them. When I\r\nreached the house, I saw a chair broken to pieces, and knew that\r\nsomething had happened, I said,--\r\n\r\n\"Hallo, Marsh!\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is that?\" said he.\r\n\r\nAnd his wife said,--\r\n\r\n\"Parker, is that you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Parker, come here!\" she called.\r\n\r\nI called Pinckney and Thompson, and we went in. Marsh met us, and said\r\nthat kidnappers had been there, had taken John Williams, and gone with\r\nhim towards Buck Hill. They had then been gone about fifteen minutes.\r\nOff we started on a rapid run to save him. We ran to a stable, got out\r\ntwo horses, and Pinckney and I rode on. Thompson soon got the rest of\r\nour party together and followed. We were going at a pretty good gait,\r\nwhen Pinckney's horse stumbled and fell, fastening his rider's leg; but\r\nI did not halt. Pinckney got his horse up and caught up with me.\r\n\r\n\"You would not care,\" said he, \"if a man were to get killed! You would\r\nnot help him!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not in such a case as this,\" I replied.\r\n\r\nWe rode on to the Maryland line, but could not overtake them. We were\r\nobliged to return, as it was near daybreak. The next day a friend of\r\nours went to Maryland to see what had been done with Williams. He went\r\nto Dr. Savington's, and the Doctor told him that the fugitive could not\r\nlive,--the kidnappers had broken his skull, and otherwise beaten him\r\nvery badly; his ankle, too, was out of place. In consequence of his\r\nmaimed condition, his mistress refused to pay the men anything for\r\nbringing him home. That was the last we ever heard of poor John\r\nWilliams; but we learned afterwards why we failed to release him on the\r\nnight he was taken. The kidnappers heard us coming, and went into the\r\nwoods out of the way, until we had passed them.\r\n\r\nAwhile before this occurrence, there lived in a town not far away from\r\nChristiana a colored man who was in the habit of decoying fugitives\r\nfresh from bondage to his house on various pretexts, and, by assuming to\r\nbe their friend, got from them the name of their master, his residence,\r\nand other needed particulars. He would then communicate with the master\r\nabout his slave, tell him at what time the man would be at his house,\r\nand when he came at the appointed hour, the poor refugee would fall into\r\nthe merciless clutches of his owner. Many persons, mostly young people,\r\nhad disappeared mysteriously from the country, from whom nothing could\r\nbe heard. At last the betrayer's connection with these transactions was\r\nclearly traced; and it was decided to force him to quit the nefarious\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nHe was too wary to allow himself to be easily taken, and a resort was\r\nhad to stratagem. I, with others, thought he deserved to be shot openly\r\nin his daughter's house, and was willing to take the consequences.\r\n\r\nAt last this man's outrages became so notorious that six of our most\r\nreliable men resolved to shoot him, if they had to burn him out to do\r\nit. After I had sworn the men in the usual form, we went to his barn,\r\ntook two bundles of wheat-straw, and, fastening them under the eaves\r\nwith wisps, applied a lighted match to each. We then took our stations a\r\nfew rods off, with rifles ready and in good condition,--mine was a\r\nsmooth-bore, with a heavy charge.\r\n\r\nThe house burned beautifully; and half an hour after it ignited the\r\nwalls fell in, but no betrayer showed himself. Instead of leaving the\r\nhouse by the rear door, as we had expected, just before the roof fell\r\nin, he broke out the front way, rushed to his next neighbor's, and left\r\nhis place without an effort to save it. We had built the fire in the\r\nrear, and looked for him there; but he ran in the opposite direction,\r\nnot only as if his life was in danger, but as if the spirit of his evil\r\ndeeds was after him.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote F: This sentence was written before the beginning of our civil\r\nwar. Viewed in the light of subsequent events, it is somewhat\r\nremarkable.--E. K.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGIN OF THE GYPSIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more than four hundred years the Gypsies have been one of the\r\nriddles of European history. Much deep study and learned research have\r\nfound plentiful employment in the endeavor to point out the land of\r\ntheir origin; and the views taken have consequently been many and\r\nvarious. It appears to the writer that all the well-known views on this\r\nsubject are far from the truth; and he desires to assert for the Gypsies\r\nan origin quite different, as he believes, from any ever yet suggested:\r\nat least, what he believes to be the real origin of this singular race\r\nis not even hinted at in the more celebrated treatises. Conscious of the\r\ndiffidence with which any one should approach a matter which so many\r\nlearned men have labored over, he advances the plea of the proverb, that\r\nthey who study the stars will stumble at stones,--a plea, that much\r\nlearning and genius may fail, where less would not be at fault.\r\n\r\nIt has been maintained that the Gypsies are Egyptians, and even that\r\nthey are the followers of Pharaoh, perhaps not yet gotten home from that\r\nRed Sea journey. Otherwise that they are the descendants of the vagabond\r\nvotaries of Isis, who were in Rome just what the Gypsies are in modern\r\nEurope. It has been argued that they were Grecian heretics; that they\r\nwere persecuted Jews; that they were Tartars; that they were Moors; and\r\nthat they were Hindoos, Grellman accepted (as it suited his theory) the\r\nassertion that they entered Germany from Turkey, though he rejected,\r\nwithout examination, the assertion, made on equally good authority, that\r\nthey entered it from Spain, from Italy, from Denmark, and from Sweden.\r\nWe find, by comparison of accounts, that they appeared within the space\r\nof a few years at every point of a circle of which Germany was the\r\ncentre, and everywhere they were regarded as foreigners,--even in Egypt.\r\n\r\nLater times have concluded that the Gypsies are Hindoos, and it is\r\ngenerally acknowledged that Grellman and Borrow have proved this. The\r\nevidences adduced are, that the Gypsy tongue is strikingly like some\r\nHindoo dialects and the parent Sanscrit,--that the races are similar in\r\ncomplexion, shape, disposition, and habits,--distinguished by the same\r\nvagrant nature, the same love of idleness, music, dancing, and thievery.\r\nIn this course of argument, that founded, upon the language is of course\r\nthe really strong one.\r\n\r\nWithout denying any of these evidences,--assenting, indeed, to every one\r\nof them,--I yet assert that the Gypsies are not of Asiatic origin, and\r\nnot, as the sturdy Dutchmen call them, the \"heathens,\"--unless we refer\r\nto the original use of that word, and call all heathens that dwell on\r\nthe heath. I assert that they are Europeans, and one of the results of\r\nthe religious wars of the fifteenth century. Bohemia is the land of\r\ntheir origin; and when we consider that one of the most enlightened\r\nnations of Europe has called them Bohemians for four hundred years, it\r\nis remarkable that that name has been so little considered in attempts\r\nto penetrate this mystery. John Ziska or Tschischka, the greatest of the\r\nHussite leaders, in the brave struggle of that sect against the Roman\r\nChurch, is the man who may be looked upon as the father of the race.\r\nThough a clumsy attempt to pronounce Tschischka by a foreign tongue\r\nmight well result in something farther from it than Gypsy, there is,\r\nperhaps, nothing in that resemblance. The word _gypsy_, which is only\r\nthe English name for this remarkable people, is, no doubt, a consequence\r\nof the ancient error that called them Egyptians; but it is odd to see\r\nEnglish writers using the resemblance between those words as an argument\r\nin favor of that origin, and thus endeavoring to perpetuate error by\r\nthe results of error.\r\n\r\nZiska became prominent as a leader in the year 1418, and in that year\r\nwas authorized to raise forces. Probably he had been busy in that way\r\neven earlier; and so, from the first, secrecy and deception would have\r\nbeen necessary in the organization of his innumerable small bodies, so\r\nsuddenly made one great body when he extorted the royal authority. He\r\ncarried on hostilities with great success until his death in 1424. By\r\nthis event, the Hussites were divided into three bodies, one of which\r\nwas called the Orphans, or orphan children of Ziska. These dwelt in\r\ntheir camps in the open country, and were under a vow never again to\r\nsleep beneath a roof. They also refused obedience to any sovereign.\r\nDriven out of Bohemia in the disasters to which the death of Ziska led\r\nthe way, and still more effectually driven out in the expatriation of\r\nall non-Catholics, the whole sect became fugitives and wanderers; and it\r\nis easy to see what kind of wanderers the \"Orphans\" particularly would\r\nbe, with their wagon-camps and their oath against houses.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable coincidence, (if it shall prove to be no more,) that\r\nthe Gypsies, a race of wanderers, peculiar by reason of the very\r\ncharacteristic that would have resulted from the Hussite oath, made\r\ntheir first appearance in Europe at this very period,--between 1418 and\r\n1427,--and in those very countries in which the Orphans ought first to\r\nhave been seen. But the earliest circumstantial notice of a company of\r\nGypsies relates to the one that visited Paris in 1427. Pasquier gave a\r\nparticular account of them, and remarks, that, though they had a very\r\nbad name, and though he was with them a great deal, he \"never lost a\r\ncoin.\"\r\n\r\nThese were called Bohemians, and the French have adhered to that name\r\never since. Doubtless the French of that day, who conversed with these\r\npeople, and looked at them with very wide-open eyes, had as good reason\r\nfor calling them Bohemians as they had for calling other men Spaniards,\r\nItalians, or Russians. Bohemia then formed too important a part of\r\nEurope for Frenchmen to confound men of that country with Hindoos just\r\nfrom Asia. The Bohemians were not strangers in France. Nearly a hundred\r\nyears before, a king of Bohemia, with a large retinue, was present on\r\nthe French side at the battle of Crecy, and Ziska himself fought at\r\nAgincourt. But writers on the Gypsies treat very slightingly the fact,\r\nthat the French called the first party that visited Paris, as mentioned\r\nabove, Bohemians, and merely say that they use that name for the\r\nGypsies, \"because they first heard of them from Bohemia.\"\r\n\r\nVarious circumstances point to the probability that the Gypsies were, at\r\ntheir first appearance in different countries, fugitives from religious\r\nintolerance. They always called themselves pilgrims, which Egyptians or\r\nHindoos would scarcely have done, but which would be quite natural in\r\nthat age to Europeans desirous of concealing their real character and of\r\ncommending themselves to strangers in whom their difference of faith\r\nmade them expect to find enemies. They called themselves Christians\r\nalso, and declared ostentatiously their conformity to the Roman Catholic\r\nrites; but they carefully kept away from the churches. This assumption\r\nof a character which they knew would protect them is in keeping with the\r\nwhole craft of their lives.\r\n\r\nAnother notable fact is, that they showed everywhere passes of\r\nsafe-conducts from the Emperor Sigismund. Ziska's followers could not\r\nhave got authentic passes, but they could forge them easily; and Hindoo\r\nstragglers, on their first appearance in Europe, would hardly have known\r\nthe value of such pieces of paper. In all the original Gypsy parties\r\nthere were dukes and counts, and these men called themselves Lords of\r\nLittle Egypt; and from this fact seems originally to have arisen the\r\nnotion that they were Egyptians. But this seems less like an assertion\r\nof their origin than like a piece of Scriptural phraseology. The\r\nHussites used in that way a Biblical imagery, like the Puritans of a\r\nlater age. Like the Puritans, they called their opponents Moabites,\r\nAmalekites, and so on. With the Puritans, Egypt was always \"the house of\r\nbondage,\" and that name was the common designation of any place of\r\npersecution.\r\n\r\nGrellman refers to the name Polgar as Indian, and as common with the\r\nGypsies; but he does not notice that the men in all the original Gypsy\r\nparties bore such sufficiently Christian appellations as Michael,\r\nAndrew, John, and Peter. _Rommany_ is the Gypsy name for a Gypsy, and\r\nthis is referred to the Sanscrit _Rama_, man, by one author, and by\r\nothers to the Coptic _Rom_. Either is possible, but sufficiently remote.\r\nBy the kind of deception referred to above, which made the Gypsies call\r\nthemselves Catholics when in Catholic countries, it is probable that\r\nthey may sometimes have gone so far as to say that they were\r\nRomans,--that is, adherents of Rome,--and habit may have fastened the\r\nname. This derivation is as good as either of the others.\r\n\r\nBut the language of the Gypsies has been most relied upon to prove their\r\nderivation from Hindostan, both by Grellman and Borrow. Remarkable\r\nsimilarities have been shown to exist between the Hindoo dialects and\r\nthe Gypsy tongue. But the argument of language is better for Bohemian\r\nthan for Hindoo origin. The Bohemians were Cechs, a branch of the great\r\nSlavic race of undoubted Asiatic origin; and the Cech language descended\r\nfrom the Sanscrit almost as directly as the Hindoo dialects did. Here is\r\na good reason why the Hindoo dialects and the Gypsy tongue--if the\r\nGypsies were Bohemians--should closely resemble one another. They were\r\nfrom the same parent stem. The learned Buesching said, \"The Gypsy\r\nlanguage is a mixture of corrupt words from the Wallachian, Slavonian,\r\nHungarian, and other nations.\" These are the cognate languages of the\r\nSlavic race, all descended from the same source, and that also the\r\nsource of the Cech. The first list of Gypsy words ever made was cited to\r\nprove an Egyptian origin, and they were Slavic. That was, perhaps, the\r\nbest list ever made, as later ones show the results of the use of the\r\nlanguages of the various lands in which the Gypsies wander.\r\n\r\nThe complexion, habits, and character of the Gypsies resemble those of\r\nthe Cechs as nearly as they do those of the Hindoos. The Cechs are an\r\neminently gay and musical race. As regards complexion, it is found that\r\nthe Gypsies in the Austrian army, who have been compelled to relinquish\r\ntheir wild life and dwell in houses, are as white as Europeans\r\ngenerally.\r\n\r\nAssuming that Grellman has disproved all the other suggested origins in\r\nfavor of the Hindoo theory, and considering the question as simply\r\nbetween India and Bohemia, it appears to me that the argument is\r\naltogether in favor of the derivation of the Gypsies from the latter\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPASSAGES FROM HAWTHORNE'S NOTE-BOOKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n_Maine, July 5, 1837_.--Here I am, settled since night before last with\r\nB----, and living very singularly. He leads a bachelor's life in his\r\npaternal mansion, only a small part of which is occupied by a family who\r\nserve him. He provides his own breakfast and supper, and occasionally\r\nhis dinner; though this is oftener, I believe, taken at the hotel or an\r\neating-house, or with some of his relatives. I am his guest, and my\r\npresence makes no alteration in his way of life. Our fare, thus far, has\r\nconsisted of bread, butter, and cheese, crackers, herrings, boiled eggs,\r\ncoffee, milk, and claret wine. He has another inmate, in the person of a\r\nqueer little Frenchman, who has his breakfast, tea, and lodging here,\r\nand finds his dinner elsewhere. Monsieur S---- does not appear to be\r\nmore than twenty-one years old,--a diminutive figure, with eyes askew,\r\nand otherwise of an ungainly physiognomy; he is ill-dressed also, in a\r\ncoarse blue coat, thin cotton pantaloons, and unbrushed boots;\r\naltogether with as little of French coxcombry as can well be imagined,\r\nthough with something of the monkey-aspect inseparable from a little\r\nFrenchman. He is, nevertheless, an intelligent and well-informed man,\r\napparently of extensive reading in his own language;--a philosopher,\r\nB---- tells me, and an infidel. His insignificant personal appearance\r\nstands in the way of his success, and prevents him from receiving the\r\nrespect which is really due to his talents and acquirements; wherefore\r\nhe is bitterly dissatisfied with the country and its inhabitants, and\r\noften expresses his feelings to B---- (who has gained his confidence to\r\na certain degree) in very strong terms.\r\n\r\nThus here are three characters, each with something out of the common\r\nway, living together somewhat like monks. B----, our host, combines more\r\nhigh and admirable qualities, of that sort which make up a gentleman,\r\nthan any other that I have met with. Polished, yet natural, frank, open,\r\nand straightforward, yet with a delicate feeling for the sensitiveness\r\nof his companions; of excellent temper and warm heart; well acquainted\r\nwith the world, with a keen faculty of observation, which he has had\r\nmany opportunities of exercising, and never varying from a code of honor\r\nand principle which is really nice and rigid in its way. There is a sort\r\nor philosophy developing itself in him which will not impossibly cause\r\nhim to settle down in this or some other equally singular course of\r\nlife. He seems almost to have made up his mind never to be married,\r\nwhich I wonder at; for he has strong affections, and is fond both of\r\nwomen and children.\r\n\r\nThe little Frenchman impresses me very strongly, too,--so lonely as he\r\nis here, struggling against the world, with bitter feelings in his\r\nbreast, and yet talking with the vivacity and gayety of his nation;\r\nmaking this his home from darkness to daylight, and enjoying here what\r\nlittle domestic comfort and confidence there is for him; and then going\r\nabout all the livelong day, teaching French to blockheads who sneer at\r\nhim, and returning at about ten o'clock in the evening (for I was wrong\r\nin saying he supped here,--he eats no supper) to his solitary room and\r\nbed. Before retiring, he goes to B----'s bedside, and, if he finds him\r\nawake, stands talking French, expressing his dislike of the\r\nAmericans,--_\"Je hais, je hais les Yankees!\"_--thus giving vent to the\r\nstifled bitterness of the whole day. In the morning I hear him getting\r\nup early, at sunrise or before, humming to himself, scuffling about his\r\nchamber with his thick boots, and at last taking his departure for a\r\nsolitary ramble till breakfast. Then he comes in, cheerful and vivacious\r\nenough, eats pretty heartily, and is off again, singing French\r\n_chansons_ as he goes down the gravel-walk. The poor fellow has nobody\r\nto sympathize with him but B----, and thus a singular connection is\r\nestablished between two utterly different characters.\r\n\r\nThen here is myself, who am likewise a queer character in my way, and\r\nhave come to spend a week or two with my friend of half a lifetime,--the\r\nlongest space, probably, that we are ever destined to spend together;\r\nfor Fate seems preparing changes for both of us. My circumstances, at\r\nleast, cannot long continue as they are and have been; and B----, too,\r\nstands between high prosperity and utter ruin.\r\n\r\nI think I should soon become strongly attached to our way of life, so\r\nindependent and untroubled by the forms and restrictions of society. The\r\nhouse is very pleasantly situated,--half a mile distant from where the\r\ntown begins to be thickly settled, and on a swell of land, with the road\r\nrunning at a distance of fifty yards, and a grassy tract and a\r\ngravel-walk between. Beyond the road rolls the Kennebec, here two or\r\nthree hundred yards wide. Putting my head out of the window, I can see\r\nit flowing steadily along straightway between wooded banks; but arriving\r\nnearly opposite the house, there is a large and level sand island in the\r\nmiddle of the stream; and just below the island the current is further\r\ninterrupted by the works of the mill-dam, which is perhaps\r\nhalf-finished, yet still in so rude a state that it looks as much like\r\nthe ruins of a dam destroyed by the spring freshets as like the\r\nfoundations of a dam yet to be. Irishmen and Canadians toil at work on\r\nit, and the echoes of their hammering and of the voices come across the\r\nriver and up to this window. Then there is a sound of the wind among the\r\ntrees round the house; and when that is silent, the calm, full, distant\r\nvoice of the river becomes audible. Looking downward thither, I see the\r\nrush of the current, and mark the different eddies, with here and there\r\nwhite specks or streaks of foam; and often a log comes floating on,\r\nglistening in the sun, as it rolls over among the eddies, having\r\nvoyaged, for aught I know, hundreds of miles from the wild, upper\r\nsources of the river, passing down, down, between lines of forest, and\r\nsometimes a rough clearing, till here it floats along by cultivated\r\nbanks, and will soon pass by the village. Sometimes a long raft of\r\nboards comes along, requiring the nicest skill in navigating it through\r\nthe narrow passage left by the mill-dam. Chaises and wagons occasionally\r\ngo along the road, the riders all giving a passing glance at the dam, or\r\nperhaps alighting to examine it more fully, and at last departing with\r\nominous shakes of the head as to the result of the enterprise. My\r\nposition is so far retired from the river and mill-dam, that, though the\r\nlatter is really rather a scene, yet a sort of quiet seems to be\r\ndiffused over the whole. Two or three times a day this quiet is broken\r\nby the sudden thunder from a quarry, where the workmen are blasting\r\nrocks for the dam; and a peal of thunder sounds strange in such a green,\r\nsunny, and quiet landscape, with the blue sky brightening the river.\r\n\r\nI have not seen much of the people. There have been, however, several\r\nincidents which amused me, though scarcely worth telling. A passionate\r\ntavern-keeper, quick as a flash of gunpowder, a nervous man, and showing\r\nin his demeanor, it seems, a consciousness of his infirmity of temper. I\r\nwas a witness of a scuffle of his with a drunken guest. The\r\ntavern-keeper, after they were separated, raved like a madman, and in a\r\ntone of voice having a drolly pathetic or lamentable sound mingled with\r\nits rage, as if he were lifting up his voice to weep. Then he jumped\r\ninto a chaise which was standing by, whipped up the horse, and drove off\r\nrapidly, as if to give his fury vent in that way.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the Fourth of July, two printer's apprentice-lads,\r\nnearly grown, dressed in jackets and very tight pantaloons of check,\r\ntight as their skins, so that they looked like harlequins or\r\ncircus-clowns, yet appeared to think themselves in perfect propriety,\r\nwith a very calm and quiet assurance of the admiration of the town. A\r\ncommon fellow, a carpenter, who, on the strength of political\r\npartisanship, asked B----'s assistance in cutting out great letters from\r\nplay-bills in order to print \"Martin Van Buren Forever\" on a flag; but\r\nB---- refused. B---- seems to be considerably of a favorite with the\r\nlower orders, especially with the Irishman and French Canadians,--the\r\nlatter accosting him in the street, and asking his assistance as an\r\ninterpreter in making their bargains for work.\r\n\r\nI meant to have dined at the hotel with B---- to-day; but having\r\nreturned to the house, leaving him to do some business in the village, I\r\nfound myself unwilling to move when the dinner-hour approached, and\r\ntherefore dined very well on bread, cheese, and eggs. Nothing of much\r\ninterest takes place. We live very comfortably in our bachelor\r\nestablishment on a cold shoulder of mutton, with ham and smoked beef and\r\nboiled eggs; and as to drinkables, we had both claret and brown sherry\r\non the dinner-table to-day. Last evening we had a long literary and\r\nphilosophical conversation with Monsieur S----. He is rather remarkably\r\nwell-informed for a man of his age, and seems to have very just notions\r\non ethics, etc., though damnably perverted as to religion. It is strange\r\nto hear philosophy of any sort from such a boyish figure. \"We\r\nphilosophers,\" he is fond of saying, to distinguish himself and his\r\nbrethren from the Christians. One of his oddities is, that, while\r\nsteadfastly maintaining an opinion that he is a very small and slow\r\neater, and the we, in common with other Yankees, eat immensely and fast,\r\nhe actually eats both faster and longer than we do, and devours, as\r\nB---- avers, more victuals than both of us together.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Saturday, July 8th._--Yesterday afternoon, a stroll with B---- up a\r\nlarge brook, he fishing for trout, and I looking on. The brook runs\r\nthrough a valley, on one side bordered by a high and precipitous bank;\r\non the other there is an interval, and then the bank rises upward and\r\nupward into a high hill with gorges and ravines separating one summit\r\nfrom another, and here and there are bare places, where the rain-streams\r\nhave washed away the grass. The brook is bestrewn with stones, some\r\nbare, some partially moss-grown, and sometimes so huge as--once at\r\nleast--to occupy almost the whole breadth of the current. Amongst these\r\nthe stream brawls, only that this word does not express its good-natured\r\nvoice, and \"murmur\" is too quite. It sings along, sometimes smooth, with\r\nthe pebbles visible beneath, sometimes rushing dark and swift, eddying\r\nand whitening past some rock, or underneath the hither or the farther\r\nbank; and at these places B----cast his line, and sometimes drew out a\r\ntrout, small, not more than five or six inches long. The farther we went\r\nup the brook, the wilder it grew. The opposite bank was covered with\r\npines and hemlocks, ascending high upwards, black and solemn. One knew\r\nthat there must be almost a precipice behind, yet we could not see it.\r\nAt the foot you could spy, a little way within the darksome shade, the\r\nroots and branches of the trees; but soon all sight was obstructed\r\namidst the trunks. On the hither side, at first the bank was bare, then\r\nfringed with alder-bushes, bending and dipping into the stream, which,\r\nfarther on brawled through the midst of a forest of maple, beech, and\r\nother trees, its course growing wilder and wilder as we proceeded. For a\r\nconsiderable distance there was a causeway, built long ago of logs, to\r\ndrag lumber upon; it was now decayed and rotten, a red decay, sometimes\r\nsunken down in the midst, here and there a knotty trunk stretching\r\nacross, apparently sound. The sun being now low towards the west, a\r\npleasant gloom and brightness were diffused through the forest, spots of\r\nbrightness scattered upon the branches, or thrown down in gold upon the\r\nlast year's leaves among the trees. At last we came to where a dam had\r\nbeen built across the brook many years ago, and was now gone to ruin,\r\nso as to make the spot look more solitary and wilder than if man had\r\nnever left vestiges of his toil there. It was a framework of logs with a\r\ncovering of plank sufficient to obstruct the onward flow of the brook;\r\nbut it found its way past the side, and came foaming and struggling\r\nalong among scattered rocks. Above the dam there was a broad and deep\r\npool, one side of which was bordered by a precipitous wall of rocks, as\r\nsmooth as if hewn out and squared, and piled one upon another, above\r\nwhich rose the forest. On the other side there was still a gently\r\nshelving bank, and the shore was covered with tall trees, among which I\r\nparticularly remarked a stately pine, wholly devoid of bark, rising\r\nwhite in aged and majestic ruin, thrusting out its barkless arms. It\r\nmust have stood there in death many years, its own ghost. Above the dam\r\nthe brook flowed through the forest, a glistening and babbling\r\nwater-path, illuminated by the sun, which sent its rays almost straight\r\nalong its course. It was as lovely and wild and peaceful as it could\r\npossibly have been a hundred years ago; and the traces of labors of men\r\nlong departed added a deeper peace to it. I bathed in the pool, and then\r\npursued my way down beside the brook, growing dark with a pleasant\r\ngloom, as the sun sank and the water became more shadowy. B---- says\r\nthat there was formerly a tradition, that the Indians used to go up this\r\nbrook, and return, after a brief absence, with large masses of lead,\r\nwhich they sold at the trading stations in Augusta; whence there has\r\nalways been an idea that there is a lead mine hereabouts. Great\r\ntoadstools were under the trees, and some small ones as yellow and\r\nalmost the size of a half-broiled yolk of an egg. Strawberries were\r\nscattered along the brookside.\r\n\r\nDined at the hotel or Mansion-House to-day. Men were playing checkers in\r\nthe parlor. The Marshal of Maine, a corpulent, jolly fellow, famed for\r\nhumor. A passenger left by the stage hiring an express onward. A bottle\r\nof champagne was quaffed at the bar.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_July 9th._--Went with B---- to pay a visit to the shanties of the Irish\r\nand Canadians. He says that they sell and exchange these small houses\r\namong themselves continually. They may be built in three or four days,\r\nand are valued at four or five dollars. When the turf that is piled\r\nagainst the walls of some of them becomes covered with grass, it makes\r\nquite a picturesque object. It was almost dusk--just candle-lighting\r\ntime--when we visited them. A young Frenchwoman, with a baby in her\r\narms, came to the door of one of them, smiling, and looking pretty and\r\nhappy. Her husband, a dark, black-haired, lively little fellow, caressed\r\nthe child, laughing and singing to it; and there was a red-bearded\r\nIrishman, who likewise fondled the little brat. Then we could hear them\r\nwithin the hut, gabbling merrily, and could see them moving about\r\nbriskly in the candlelight, through the window and open door. An old\r\nIrishwoman sat in the door of another hut, under the influence of an\r\nextra dose of rum,--she being an old lady of somewhat dissipated habits.\r\nShe called to B----, and began to talk to him about her resolution not\r\nto give up her house: for it is his design to get her out of it. She is\r\na true virago, and though somewhat restrained by respect for him, she\r\nevinced a sturdy design to remain here through the winter, or at least\r\nfor a considerable time longer. He persisting, she took her stand in the\r\ndoorway of the hut, and stretched out her fist in a very Amazonian\r\nattitude, \"Nobody,\" quoth she, \"shall drive me out of this house, till\r\nmy praties are out of the ground.\" Then would she wheedle and laugh and\r\nblarney, beginning in a rage, and ending as if she had been in jest.\r\nMeanwhile her husband stood by very quiet, occasionally trying to still\r\nher; but it is to be presumed, that, after our departure, they came to\r\nblows, it being a custom with the Irish husbands and wives to settle\r\ntheir disputes with blows; and it is said the woman often proves the\r\nbetter man. The different families also have battles, and occasionally\r\nthe Irish fight with the Canadians. The latter, however, are much the\r\nmore peaceable, never quarrelling among themselves, and seldom with\r\ntheir neighbors. They are frugal, and often go back to Canada with\r\nconsiderable sums of money. B---- has gained much influence both with\r\nthe Irish and the French,--with the latter, by dint of speaking to them\r\nin their own language. He is the umpire in their disputes, and their\r\nadviser, and they look up to him as a protector and patron-friend. I\r\nhave been struck to see with what careful integrity and wisdom he\r\nmanages matters among them, hitherto having known him only as a free and\r\ngay young man. He appears perfectly to understand their general\r\ncharacter, of which he gives no very flattering description. In these\r\nhuts, less than twenty feet square, he tells me that upwards of twenty\r\npeople have sometimes been lodged.\r\n\r\nA description of a young lady who had formerly been insane, and now felt\r\nthe approach of a new fit of madness. She had been out to ride, had\r\nexerted herself much, and had been very vivacious. On her return, she\r\nsat down in a thoughtful and despondent attitude, looking very sad, but\r\none of the loveliest objects that ever were seen. The family spoke to\r\nher, but she made no answer, nor took the least notice; but still sat\r\nlike a statue in her chair,--a statue of melancholy and beauty. At last\r\nthey led her away to her chamber.\r\n\r\nWe went to meeting this forenoon. I saw nothing remarkable, unless a\r\nlittle girl in the next pew to us, three or four years old, who fell\r\nasleep, with her head in the lap of her maid, and looked very pretty: a\r\npicture of sleeping innocence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_July 11th, Tuesday._--A drive with B---- to Hallowell, yesterday, where\r\nwe dined, and afterwards to Gardiner. The most curious object in this\r\nlatter place was the elegant new mansion of ----. It stands on the site\r\nof his former dwelling, which was destroyed by fire. The new building\r\nwas estimated to cost about thirty thousand dollars; but twice as much\r\nhas already been expended, and a great deal more will be required to\r\ncomplete it. It is certainly a splendid structure; the material, granite\r\nfrom the vicinity. At the angles it has small, circular towers; the\r\nportal is lofty and imposing. Relatively to the general style of\r\ndomestic architecture in our country, it well deserves the name of\r\ncastle or palace. Its situation, too, is fine, far retired from the\r\npublic road, and attainable by a winding carriage-drive; standing amid\r\nfertile fields, and with large trees in the vicinity. There is also a\r\nbeautiful view from the mansion adown the Kennebec.\r\n\r\nBeneath some of the large trees we saw the remains of circular seats,\r\nwhereupon the family used to sit before the former house was burned\r\ndown. There was no one now in the vicinity of the place, save a man and\r\na yoke of oxen; and what he was about, I did not ascertain. Mr. ---- at\r\npresent resides in a small dwelling, little more than a cottage, beside\r\nthe main road, not far from the gateway which gives access to his\r\npalace.\r\n\r\nAt Gardiner, on the wharf, I witnessed the starting of the steamboat New\r\nEngland for Boston. There was quite a collection of people, looking on\r\nor taking leave of passengers,--the steam puffing,--stages arriving,\r\nfull-freighted with ladies and gentlemen. A man was one moment too late;\r\nbut running along the gunwale of a mud-scow, and jumping into a skiff,\r\nhe was put on board by a black fellow. The dark cabin, wherein,\r\ndescending from the sunshiny deck, it was difficult to discern the\r\nfurniture, looking-glasses, and mahogany wainscoting. I met two old\r\ncollege acquaintances,--O----, who was going to Boston, and B----, with\r\nwhom we afterwards drank a glass of wine at the hotel.\r\n\r\nB----, Mons. S----, and myself continue to live in the same style as\r\nheretofore. We appear mutually to be very well pleased with each other.\r\nMons. S---- displays many comical qualities, and manages to insure us\r\nseveral hearty laughs every morning and evening,--those being the\r\nseasons when we meet. I am going to take lessons from him in the\r\npronunciation of French. Of female society I see nothing. The only\r\npetticoat that comes within our premises appertains to Nancy, the\r\npretty, dark-eyed maid-servant of the man who lives in the other part of\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\nOn the road from Hallowell to Augusta we saw little booths, in two\r\nplaces, erected on the roadside, where boys offered beer, apples, etc.,\r\nfor sale. We passed an Irishwoman with a child in her arms, and a heavy\r\nbundle, and afterwards an Irishman with a light bundle, sitting by the\r\nhighway. They were husband and wife; and B---- says that an Irishman and\r\nhis wife, on their journeys, do not usually walk side by side, but that\r\nthe man gives the woman the heaviest burden to carry, and walks on\r\nlightly ahead!\r\n\r\nA thought comes into my mind: Which sort of house excites the most\r\ncontemptuous feelings in the beholder,--such a house as Mr. ----'s, all\r\ncircumstances considered, or the board-built and turf-buttressed hovels\r\nof these wild Irish, scattered about as if they had sprung up like\r\nmushrooms, in the dells and gorges, and along the banks of the river?\r\nMushrooms, by the way, spring up where the roots of an old tree are\r\nhidden under the ground.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Thursday, July 13th._--Two small Canadian boys came to our house\r\nyesterday, with strawberries to sell. It sounds strange to hear children\r\nbargaining in French on the borders of Yankee-land. Among other\r\nlanguages spoken hereabouts must be reckoned the wild Irish. Some of the\r\nlaborers on the mill-dam can speak nothing else. The intermixture of\r\nforeigners sometimes gives rise to quarrels between them and the\r\nnatives. As we were going to the village yesterday afternoon, we\r\nwitnessed the beginning of a quarrel between a Canadian and a\r\nYankee,--the latter accusing the former of striking his oxen. B----\r\nthrust himself between and parted them; but they afterwards renewed\r\ntheir fray, and the Canadian, I believe, thrashed the Yankee\r\nsoundly,--for which he had to pay twelve dollars. Yet he was but a\r\nlittle fellow.\r\n\r\nComing to the Mansion-House about supper-time, we found somewhat of a\r\nconcourse of people, the Governor and Council being in session on the\r\nsubject of the disputed territory. The British have lately imprisoned a\r\nman who was sent to take the census; and the Mainiacs are much excited\r\non the subject. They wish the Governor to order out the militia at once,\r\nand take possession of the territory with the strong hand. There was a\r\nBritish army-captain at the Mansion-House; and an idea was thrown out\r\nthat it would be as well to seize upon him as a hostage. I would, for\r\nthe joke's sake, that it had been done. Personages at the tavern: the\r\nGovernor, somewhat stared after as he walked through the bar-room;\r\nCouncillors seated about, sitting on benches near the bar, or on the\r\nstoop along the front of the house; the Adjutant-General of the State;\r\ntwo young Blue-Noses, from Canada or the Provinces; a gentleman\r\n\"thumbing his hat\" for liquor, or perhaps playing off the trick of the\r\n\"honest landlord\" on some stranger. The decanters and wine-bottles on\r\nthe move, and the beer and soda-founts pouring out continual streams,\r\nwith a whiz. Stage-drivers, etc., asked to drink with the aristocracy,\r\nand mine host treating and being treated. Rubicund faces; breaths\r\nodorous of brandy and water. Occasionally the pop of a champagne cork.\r\n\r\nReturned home, and took a lesson in French of Mons. S----. I like him\r\nvery much, and have seldom met with a more honest, simple, and\r\napparently so well-principled a man; which good qualities I impute to\r\nhis being, by the father's side, of German blood. He looks more like a\r\nGerman--or, as he says, like a Swiss--than a Frenchman, having very\r\nlight hair and a light complexion, and not a French expression. He is a\r\nvivacious little fellow, and wonderfully excitable to mirth; and it is\r\ntruly a sight to see him laugh;--every feature partakes of his movement,\r\nand even his whole body shares in it, as he rises and dances about the\r\nroom. He has great variety of conversation, commensurate with his\r\nexperiences in life, and sometimes will talk Spanish, _ore\r\nrotundo_,--sometimes imitate the Catholic priests, chanting Latin songs\r\nfor the dead, in deep, gruff, awful tones, producing really a very\r\nstrong impression,--then he will break out into a light, French song,\r\nperhaps of love, perhaps of war, acting it out, as if on the stage of a\r\ntheatre: all this intermingled with continual fun, excited by the\r\nincidents of the passing moment. He has Frenchified all our names,\r\ncalling B---- Monsieur Du Pont, myself M. de L'Aubepine, and himself M.\r\nle Berger, and all, Knights of the Round-Table. And we live in great\r\nharmony and brotherhood, as queer a life as anybody leads, and as queer\r\na set as may be found anywhere. In his more serious intervals, he talks\r\nphilosophy and deism, and preaches obedience to the law of reason and\r\nmorality; which law he says (and I believe him) he has so well observed,\r\nthat, notwithstanding his residence in dissolute countries, he has never\r\nyet been sinful. He wishes me, eight or nine weeks hence, to accompany\r\nhim on foot to Quebec, and then to Niagara and New York. I should like\r\nit well, if my circumstances and other considerations would permit. What\r\npleases much in Mons. S---- is the simple and childlike enjoyment he\r\nfinds in trifles, and the joy with which he speaks of going back to his\r\nown country, away from the dull Yankees, who here misunderstand and\r\ndespise him. Yet I have never heard him speak harshly of them. I rather\r\nthink that B---- and I will be remembered by him with more pleasure than\r\nanybody else in the country; for we have sympathized with him, and\r\ntreated him kindly, and like a gentleman and an equal; and he comes to\r\nus at night as to home and friends.\r\n\r\nI went down to the river to-day to see B---- fish for salmon with a\r\nfly,--a hopeless business; for he says that only one instance has been\r\nknown in the United States of salmon being taken otherwise than with a\r\nnet. A few chubs were all the fruit of his piscatory efforts. But while\r\nlooking at the rushing and rippling stream, I saw a great fish, some six\r\nfeet long and thick in proportion, suddenly emerge at whole length, turn\r\na somerset, and then vanish again beneath the water. It was of a\r\nglistening, yellowish brown, with its fins all spread, and looking very\r\nstrange and startling, darting out so lifelike from the black water,\r\nthrowing itself fully into the bright sunshine, and then lost to sight\r\nand to pursuit. I saw also a long, flat-bottomed boat go up the river,\r\nwith a brisk wind, and against a strong stream. Its sails were of\r\ncurious construction: a long mast, with two sails below, one on each\r\nside of the boat, and a broader one surmounting them. The sails were\r\ncolored brown, and appeared like leather or skins, but were really\r\ncloth. At a distance, the vessel looked like, or at least I compared it\r\nto, a monstrous water-insect, skimming along the river. If the sails had\r\nbeen crimson or yellow, the resemblance would have been much closer.\r\nThere was a pretty spacious raised cabin in the after part of the boat.\r\nIt moved along lightly, and disappeared between the woody banks. These\r\nboats have the two parallel sails attached to the same yard, and some\r\nhave two sails, one surmounting the other. They trade to Waterville and\r\nthereabouts,--names, as \"Paul Pry,\" on their sails.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Saturday, July 15th._--Went with B---- yesterday to visit several Irish\r\nshanties, endeavoring to find out who had stolen some rails of a fence.\r\nAt the first door where we knocked, (a shanty with an earthen mound\r\nheaped against the wall, two or three feet thick,) the inmates were not\r\nup, though it was past eight o'clock. At last a middle-aged woman showed\r\nherself, half-dressed, and completing her toilet. Threats were made of\r\ntearing down her house; for she is a lady of very indifferent morals,\r\nand sells rum. Few of these people are connected with the mill-dam,--or,\r\nat least, many are not so, but have intruded themselves into the vacant\r\nhuts which were occupied by the mill-dam people last year. In two or\r\nthree places hereabouts there is quite a village of these dwellings,\r\nwith a clay and board chimney, or oftener an old barrel smoked and\r\ncharred with the fire. Some of their roofs are covered with sods, and\r\nappear almost subterranean. One of the little hamlets stands on both\r\nsides of a deep dell, wooded and bush-grown, with a vista, as it were,\r\ninto the heart of a wood in one direction, and to the broad, sunny river\r\nin the other: there was a little rivulet, crossed by a plank, at the\r\nbottom of the dell. At two doors we saw very pretty and modest-looking\r\nyoung women,--one with a child in her arms. Indeed, they all have\r\ninnumerable little children; and they are invariably in good health,\r\nthough always dirty of face. They come to the door while their mothers\r\nare talking with the visitors, standing straight up on their bare legs,\r\nwith their little plump bodies protruding, in one hand a small tin\r\nsaucepan and in the other an iron spoon, with unwashed mouths, looking\r\nas independent as any child or grown person in the land. They stare\r\nunabashed, but make no answer when spoken to. \"I've no call to your\r\nfence, Misser B----.\" It seems strange that a man should have the right,\r\nunarmed with any legal instrument, of tearing down the dwelling-houses\r\nof a score of families, and driving the inmates forth without a shelter.\r\nYet B---- undoubtedly has this right; and it is not a little striking to\r\nsee how quietly these people contemplate the probability of his\r\nexercising it,--resolving, indeed, to burrow in their holes as long as\r\nmay be, yet caring about as little for an ejectment as those who could\r\nfind a tenement anywhere, and less. Yet the women, amid all the trials\r\nof their situation, appear to have kept up the distinction between\r\nvirtue and vice: those who can claim the former will not associate with\r\nthe latter. When the women travel with young children, they carry the\r\nbaby slung at their backs, and sleeping quietly. The dresses of the\r\nnew-comers are old-fashioned, making them look aged before their time.\r\n\r\nMonsieur S---- shaving himself yesterday morning. He was in excellent\r\nspirits, and could not keep his tongue or body still more than long\r\nenough to make two or three consecutive strokes at his beard. Then he\r\nwould turn, flourishing his razor and grimacing joyously, enacting droll\r\nantics, breaking out into scraps and verses of drinking-songs, \"_A\r\nboire! a boire!_\"--then laughing heartily, and crying, \"_Vive la\r\ngaite!_\"--then resuming his task, looking into the glass with grave\r\nface, on which, however, a grin would soon break out anew, and all his\r\npranks would be repeated with variations. He turned this foolery to\r\nphilosophy, by observing that mirth contributed to goodness of heart,\r\nand to make us love our fellow-creatures. Conversing with him in the\r\nevening, he affirmed, with evident belief in the truth of what he said,\r\nthat he would have no objection, except that it would be a very foolish\r\nthing, to expose his whole heart, his whole inner man, to the view of\r\nthe world. Not that there would not be much evil discovered there; but,\r\nas he was conscious of being in a state of mental and moral improvement,\r\nworking out his progress onward, he would not shrink from such a\r\nscrutiny. This talk was introduced by his mentioning the \"Minister's\r\nBlack Veil,\" which he said he had seen translated into French, as an\r\nexercise, by a Miss Appleton of Bangor.\r\n\r\nSaw by the river-side, late in the afternoon, one of the above-described\r\nboats going into the stream, with the water rippling at the prow, from\r\nthe strength of the current and of the boat's motion. By-and-by comes\r\ndown a raft, perhaps twenty yards long, guided by two men, one at each\r\nend,--the raft itself of boards sawed at Waterville, and laden with\r\nsquare bundles of shingles and round bundles of clapboards. \"Friend,\"\r\nsays one man, \"how is the tide now?\"--this being important to the onward\r\nprogress. They make fast to a tree, in order to wait for the tide to\r\nrise a little higher. It would be pleasant enough to float down the\r\nKennebec on one of these rafts, letting the river conduct you onward at\r\nits own pace, leisurely displaying to you all the wild or ordered\r\nbeauties along its banks, and perhaps running you aground in some\r\npeculiarly picturesque spot, for your longer enjoyment of it. Another\r\nobject, perhaps, is a solitary man paddling himself down the river in a\r\nsmall canoe, the light, lonely touch of his paddle in the water making\r\nthe silence seem deeper. Every few minutes a sturgeon leaps forth,\r\nsometimes behind you, so that you merely hear the splash, and, turning\r\nhastily around, see nothing but the disturbed water. Sometimes he darts\r\nstraight on end out of a quiet black spot on which your eyes happen to\r\nbe fixed, and, when even his tail is clear of the surface, he falls down\r\non his side, and disappears.\r\n\r\nOn the river-bank, an Irishwoman washing some clothes, surrounded by her\r\nchildren, whose babbling sounds pleasantly along the edge of the shore;\r\nand she also answers in a sweet, kindly, and cheerful voice, though an\r\nimmoral woman, and without the certainty of bread or shelter from day to\r\nday. An Irishman sitting angling on the brink with an alder pole and a\r\nclothes-line. At frequent intervals, the scene is suddenly broken by a\r\nloud report like thunder, rolling along the banks, echoing and\r\nreverberating afar. It is a blast of rocks. Along the margin, sometimes\r\nsticks of timber made fast, either separately or several together;\r\nstones of some size, varying the pebbles and sand; a clayey spot, where\r\na shallow brook runs into the river, not with a deep outlet, but finding\r\nits way across the bank in two or three single runlets. Looking upward\r\ninto the deep glen whence it issues, you see its shady current.\r\nElsewhere, a high acclivity, with the beach between it and the river,\r\nthe ridge broken and caved away, so that the earth looks fresh and\r\nyellow, and is penetrated by the nests of birds. An old, shining\r\ntree-trunk, half in and half out of the water. An island of gravel, long\r\nand narrow, in the centre of the river. Chips, blocks of wood, slabs,\r\nand other scraps of lumber, strewed along the beach; logs drifting down.\r\nThe high bank covered with various trees and shrubbery, and, in one\r\nplace, two or three Irish shanties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOURT-CARDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat a hand the Major has dealt me! Do look over my shoulder, Madam, and\r\nsee these cards! What quaint, odd, old-time figures they are! I wonder\r\nif the kings and queens of by-gone centuries were such grotesque-looking\r\nobjects as these. Look at that Queen of Spades! Why, Dr. Slop's\r\nabdominal sesquipedality was sylph-like grace to the Lambertian girth\r\nshe displays. And note the pattern of her dress, if dress it can be\r\ncalled,--that rotund expanse of heraldic, bar-sinistered, Chinese\r\nembroidery. Look at that Jack of Diamonds! What a pair of collar-bones\r\nhe must have! That little feat of Atlas would be child's-play to him;\r\nfor he could step off with a whole orrery on those shoulders. And his\r\nhands! what Liliputian phalanges, which Beau Brummel, or D'Orsay, or any\r\nother professional dandy might die envying! As for the King of Hearts,\r\nhe looks as much like a pet of the fair sex as Boanerges or Bung the\r\nBeadle. And what strange anatomical proportions they exhibit, with their\r\ngigantic heads, abortive necks, and the calves of their legs protuberant\r\naround their tibias and fibulas, alike before and behind! And then they\r\nare all left-handed! Were these the gay gallants and fair dames of the\r\ngolden age of chivalry? Were these shapeless things the forms and\r\ncostumes of the princes and princesses of ancient France? Why, the\r\ndark-skinned old-clo' men, who hang their cast-off raiment in Brattle\r\nStreet, would be mobbed, if they paraded such vestments at their doors;\r\nand Papanti would break his fiddle-bow over the head of any awkward lout\r\nwho should unfortunately assume such an ungainly position.\r\n\r\nBut the power they wield! Ah, my dear Madam, kings and queens may be\r\nbacked like a whale or humped like a camel, but down goes the world on\r\nits marrow-bones, and worships them for Venuses and Adonises. And as for\r\nthis particular reigning family, these four great branches of the\r\nHearts, Spades, Diamonds, and Clubs, Diana, fresh from the bath, never\r\nlooked so enticing to the eager eyes of a losing player as their\r\nBrobdignagian dames, nor Apollo himself so beautiful as the ugly mugs of\r\ntheir lumbering kings. The Baroness Bernstein would bend her old back\r\nover the table to greet their wall-eyed monarchs, and forget young Harry\r\nwas by; and little Nell's grandfather would bow beneath the midnight\r\ncandle to caress those greasy Gorgons, while she, sweet little girl, was\r\nwaiting his return in loneliness. All the other crowned heads of\r\nChristendom are titled nobodies beside these mighty potentates. The\r\nGeneral of the Jesuits wields, they say, wonderful power; but his\r\nsceptre is a bulrush beside the truncheon which these kings of the earth\r\nhold in their grasp. And here, yes, here in Republican America, the\r\nthousands who scout Napoleon, frown on Victoria, and pity the Pope, do\r\nnightly homage to this mighty dynasty, and find grace and loveliness in\r\ntheir bottle noses and crooked legs. And--must I confess it, Madam?--do\r\nnot I, democratic Asmodeus, when I play my quiet rubber at so much a\r\ncorner, look chopfallen at the deuces and treys which I despondently\r\narrange in numerical order, and welcome, with beating heart, those same\r\ncrowned heads, as they lift themselves before me? Oh, it is not\r\ngambling, Madam. Only something to make it interesting, so that the\r\nMajor and I shall keep our minds on the game.\r\n\r\nAnd do we not all play our little game in the world,--sometimes with all\r\nthat makes it bright to us at stake? What is the paltry sum beside me to\r\nthat which we all of us hold in our hands, to be decided by the deal of\r\nFortune? You don't play whist. And yet, Madam, I have seen you at a game\r\nof chance, in which you have risked your peace, your happiness, your\r\nfuture, upon what another should deal out to you. You don't understand\r\nme? In the great game of life, Frank offered you his hand, and you took\r\nit. I hope it held court-cards. We are all players. The lean and\r\nsanctified bigot, who looks in holy horror on this printed pasteboard,\r\nas though it were the legitimate offspring of the Devil and Dr. Faustus,\r\nplays his own pious game at winning souls, and risks--charity. The\r\ngriping money-catcher, who shudders at the thought of losing gold in\r\nspendthrift play, takes his own close and cunning game at winning\r\nwealth, and risks--esteem. The ambitious aspirant, who scorns such empty\r\nthings as cards, plays boldly at his daring game at winning position,\r\nand risks--honor. The bright-eyed girl throws heart and soul into the\r\nenchanting game of love, and risks--virtue. Charity, esteem, honor,\r\nvirtue,--are not these great stakes to offer, beside which my modest\r\nrisk sinks into very insignificance? Ah, we all play, and with what\r\nvaried success! How many poor, unlucky wights turn up deuces all their\r\nlife, while others, born under luckier stars, hold a fistful of kings\r\nand queens! How many eyes grow dim over the faint chances of small\r\ndigits, while others sparkle in the reflected light of those regal\r\nrobes! Ah, my dear Madam, not only in dank forecastles, in foul taverns,\r\nin luxurious club-houses, or elegant saloons, does Fortune deal out her\r\nwinning or losing cards. She spreads them before us on the green cloth\r\nof life's table, in that game which counts up its gains or losses in\r\nanother world.\r\n\r\nDid you ever see an aeronaut, when he has risen high above the earth,\r\nscatter, with lavish hand, a host of little cards, which flutter down\r\nupon us, twisting and turning, in showers of glittering colors? He but\r\ntypifies the hand of Fate, which deals to us, brilliant with the hopes\r\nthat tint them in rainbow beauty, the cards of life's eager game. We\r\ngather them up joyfully; but, alas! how rapidly their fictitious beauty\r\nfades, and what miserable pasteboard affairs they become to us, as, one\r\nby one, we lay them down, and see our treasures dwindling away from us\r\nwith them, as they go!\r\n\r\nSomebody must win? Yes, Madam, somebody gets the court-cards. We all get\r\nthem sometimes; and we too often play them very wrongly. We throw away\r\nour kings and our queens. We pass by the opportunities to score, while\r\nsome happier child of fortune bears off all the honors. But not always.\r\nFortune rarely pursues any of us with unremitting ill-will. She sends us\r\nall court-cards, and we have only to trust on and wait for the change\r\nthat is to bring, at last, success. Let us never throw up our hands in\r\ndespair. Somebody--he must have been a tailor, or with sartorial\r\nproclivities--has said that there is a silver lining to every cloud. And\r\nso we all of us hold hands, which, among deuces and treys, have some\r\ncourt-cards. Let us not then inveigh against the goddess who blindly\r\ndistributes them. Be it our aim to play those well which fall to our\r\nshare, and not recklessly cast them away, because we find fewer of those\r\nbroad-shouldered, goggle-eyed, party-colored gentry than we hoped for.\r\nNo! let us tuck them carefully away under our thumbs, and make the most\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Asmodeus may have pined in grief, playing his little deuces and\r\nnever winning the great stake of fame;--but who shall tell? May not his\r\nhopeful heart break forth some day with regnant power which shall bear\r\naway the prize? Frank, you know, has toiled day and night for wealth to\r\nbuy comfort and ease for his modest home. He has made his little\r\nventures, and has seen his dreams of grand results fade from him, day by\r\nday. Let him venture on. By-and-by his vessels shall come home laden\r\nwith noble freights; and his name shall be favorably known on 'Change,\r\nand be printed in the lists of men who pay heavy taxes on swelling\r\nfortunes; and you shall have your jewels and trinkets with the best.\r\nPinxit, who has been starving in his garret, and whose walls are lined\r\nwith dusty canvas, shall lay on colors which shall charm the world; his\r\nold, neglected frames shall be brought out, and the world shall find\r\nApollos in his men, and Venuses in his women, which before were only\r\nmeaner beauties; Vanitas shall loiter round his easel and command his\r\npencil with ready gold; and Art-Journals shall rehearse his praises in\r\nstrange, cabalistic words. Scripsit, who has digested his paltry rasher\r\nin moody silence, shall touch the hearts of men with new-born words of\r\nflame; and the poor epic, which once had served a clownish huckster's\r\nvulgar need, shall travel far and wide, in blue and gold, and lie on\r\ntables weighed with words familiar in all mouths. Patrista, who,\r\nthirsting for his country's good, has been, perforce, content to see all\r\nothers rise and sway the crowd, while he has toiled in vain, shall shake\r\nthe nation with his eloquence, and from his chair of state, whence go\r\nabroad the statutes he has framed, shall read again his earlier works,\r\nnow rescued from the past to teach the young. Reporters on his words\r\nshall hang, from every window shall his sapient visage smile, and even\r\nthe London Times shall think it worth the while to underrate him.\r\n\r\nAnd then, my dear Madam, we rarely play alone. The melancholy\r\nunfortunates reduced to solitaire are few indeed. We have partners,\r\nMadam, to share our losses and our gains,--partners to mourn over our\r\npoor little lost deuces, and rejoice when royalty holds its court under\r\nour thumbs. Have not I beloved Mrs. Asmodeus, the lovely, kind, clever\r\npartner of my varied fortune? Did she not deal to me, one summer eve,\r\nthe best bower in the pack, who reigns over all the kings and queens in\r\nor out of Christendom, and whose sway remains supreme through all the\r\nchanging suits of time and fortune? He does not sport the garb of those\r\nelder knaves, it is true, though he is knavish enough when occasion\r\noffers,--he is at this moment inspecting a new jack-knife, and will, I\r\nfear, whittle off one of his dear, chubby fingers,--but he outranks all\r\nthe crowned monarchs in the world. Whom do I mean? Whom, but Thomas the\r\nFirst, Thomas the Only, my first-born, royal son? When that king of your\r\nown heart was taken from you,--when the little frocks, richer than\r\nermine robes, were hid away in sacred recesses,--when the little toys,\r\nmightier than jewelled sceptres, were garnered up and kept as holy\r\nrelics,--when the house no longer echoed to the tones of the sweet\r\nchildish voice, and the silence of the grave settled over earth,--when\r\nthe glare of day was hateful and the darkness of night fearful, and\r\nlife, without the darling one, was living death,--had you not then a\r\npartner, a kind, tender, sympathizing partner, who took you to his\r\nheart, and bowed his head with you, and knit you closer to him by a bond\r\nthe strongest life can weave, the bond of sorrow shared? And look\r\nfarther back into the past, before sorrow came, and when light-hearted,\r\nbeaming, hoping joy dwelt within you. When you used to catch Frank's eye\r\nwith those tiny boots and flowing skirts, as you gracefully swept by\r\nhim, had you not a partner to share those throbbing emotions? Were not\r\nall the hopes, dreams, and doubts, which then awoke, new-born within\r\nyou, reechoed and fondly shared? Did he not bear away, for days and\r\nnights, the brightness of your smile, the bend of your angelic head, and\r\nthe trip of the tiny boots? And when the Heaven-sent moment came for the\r\ntongue to tell what the heart had so long cherished in silence, was\r\nthere not a partner before you who dealt out words which filled your\r\nsoul with rapture, and helped you to win the dearest prize that earth\r\naffords,--a mutual love? And look farther on into the distant future,\r\nwhen the tiny boots shall have long been cast aside, and the flowing\r\nsilks shall have sunken into inexpansive, sober gray,--when the early\r\njoys and the early sorrows shall fade into the dim, half-remembered\r\npast,--when time shall have blanched the curly locks which first caught\r\nyour girlish fancy, and lined the fair brow you once kissed in its manly\r\nbeauty,--when the bloom of your own youth shall have passed away, and,\r\nin its stead, you see the faded remnants of your queenly prime,--when\r\nround you gather the fair youths and maidens who are living over the\r\njoys and sorrows which once moved your tired heart, and which you then\r\nshall look upon with that sad philosophy which tells you that the day\r\nhas come when earthly interests can never sway you more,--will you not\r\nthen have a partner who will share the memories of the past, and, heart\r\nto heart, will tread with you the slow decline, and win the prize\r\noutranking all,--eternal peace?\r\n\r\nYes, Madam, Jack has his messmate in the tarry bunk; Dick has his pal in\r\nthe hidden haunt; the Major winks to the Colonel in the luxurious club;\r\nand Madame smiles on Monsieur in the brilliant drawing-room. Castor and\r\nPollux pitched their quoits, Damon and Pythias ran their races, Strephon\r\nand Chloe ogled and blushed, and Darby and Joan tottered hand in hand\r\nalong, in olden times; and all over the world, to-day, the never-ending\r\ngame of human passion is played and shared by eager, restless, trembling\r\nhearts.\r\n\r\nI declare, while I have been chatting aside with you, I have trumped the\r\nMajor's ace, and lost the odd trick and the game! What a thunder-cloud\r\nhe looks like! Ah, Madam, let us hope that we may all play the cards\r\nwhich Fortune shall deal to us, so as never to lose the prize we covet!\r\nAnd when they are at last thrown by, and the game of life is over, may\r\nwe have won those riches which neither moth nor rust will corrupt! May\r\nkingly honor and queenly virtue guide us on, and lead us to those courts\r\nabove, where they forever reign in sublime power!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA LANDSCAPE PAINTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you remember how, a dozen years ago, a number of our friends were\r\nstartled by the report of the rupture of young Locksley's engagement\r\nwith Miss Leary? This event made some noise in its day. Both parties\r\npossessed certain claims to distinction: Locksley in his wealth, which\r\nwas believed to be enormous, and the young lady in her beauty, which was\r\nin truth very great. I used to hear that her lover was fond of comparing\r\nher to the Venus of Milo; and, indeed, if you can imagine the mutilated\r\ngoddess with her full complement of limbs, dressed out by Madame de\r\nCrinoline, and engaged in small talk beneath the drawing-room\r\nchandelier, you may obtain a vague notion of Miss Josephine Leary.\r\nLocksley, you remember, was rather a short man, dark, and not\r\nparticularly good-looking; and when he walked about with his betrothed,\r\nit was half a matter of surprise that he should have ventured to propose\r\nto a young lady of such heroic proportions. Miss Leary had the gray eyes\r\nand auburn hair which I have always assigned to the famous statue. The\r\none defect in her face, in spite of an expression of great candor and\r\nsweetness, was a certain lack of animation. What it was besides her\r\nbeauty that attracted Locksley I never discovered: perhaps, since his\r\nattachment was so short-lived, it was her beauty alone. I say that his\r\nattachment was of brief duration, because the rupture was understood to\r\nhave come from him. Both he and Miss Leary very wisely held their\r\ntongues on the matter; but among their friends and enemies it of course\r\nreceived a hundred explanations. That most popular with Locksley's\r\nwell-wishers was, that he had backed out (these events are discussed,\r\nyou know, in fashionable circles very much as an expected prize-fight\r\nwhich has miscarried is canvassed in reunions of another kind) only on\r\nflagrant evidence of the lady's--what, faithlessness?--on overwhelming\r\nproof of the most _mercenary_ spirit on the part of Miss Leary. You see,\r\nour friend was held capable of doing battle for an \"idea.\" It must be\r\nowned that this was a novel charge; but, for myself, having long known\r\nMrs. Leary, the mother, who was a widow with four daughters, to be an\r\ninveterate old screw, I took the liberty of accrediting the existence of\r\na similar propensity in her eldest born. I suppose that the young lady's\r\nfamily had, on their own side, a very plausible version of their\r\ndisappointment. It was, however, soon made up to them by Josephine's\r\nmarriage with a gentleman of expectations very nearly as brilliant as\r\nthose of her old suitor. And what was _his_ compensation? That is\r\nprecisely my story.\r\n\r\nLocksley disappeared, as you will remember from public view. The events\r\nabove alluded to happened in March. On calling at his lodgings in April,\r\nI was told he had gone to the \"country.\" But towards the last of May I\r\nmet him. He told me that he was on the look-out for a quiet,\r\nunfrequented place on the sea-shore, where he might rusticate and\r\nsketch. He was looking very poorly. I suggested Newport, and I remember\r\nhe hardly had the energy to smile at the simple joke. We parted without\r\nmy having been able to satisfy him, and for a very long time I quite\r\nlost sight of him. He died seven years ago, at the age of thirty-five.\r\nFor five years, accordingly, he managed to shield his life from the eyes\r\nof men. Through circumstances which I need not detail, a large portion\r\nof his personal property has come into my hands. You will remember that\r\nhe was a man of what are called elegant tastes: that is, he was\r\nseriously interested in arts and letters. He wrote some very bad poetry,\r\nbut he produced a number of remarkable paintings. He left a mass of\r\npapers on all subjects, few of which are adapted to be generally\r\ninteresting. A portion of them, however, I highly prize,--that which\r\nconstitutes his private diary. It extends from his twenty-fifth to his\r\nthirtieth year, at which period it breaks off suddenly. If you will come\r\nto my house, I will show you such of his pictures and sketches as I\r\npossess, and, I trust, convert you to my opinion that he had in him the\r\nstuff of a great painter. Meanwhile I will place before you the last\r\nhundred pages of his diary, as an answer to your inquiry regarding the\r\nultimate view taken by the great Nemesis of his treatment of Miss\r\nLeary,--his scorn of the magnificent Venus Victrix. The recent decease\r\nof the one person who had a voice paramount to mine in the disposal of\r\nLocksley's effects enables me to act without reserve.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Cragthorpe, June 9th._--I have been sitting some minutes, pen in hand,\r\npondering whether on this new earth, beneath this new sky, I had better\r\nresume these occasional records of my idleness. I think I will at all\r\nevents make the experiment. If we fail, as Lady Macbeth remarks, we\r\nfail. I find my entries have been longest when my life has been dullest.\r\nI doubt not, therefore, that, once launched into the monotony of village\r\nlife, I shall sit scribbling from morning till night. If nothing\r\nhappens--But my prophetic soul tells me that something _will_ happen. I\r\nam determined that something shall,--if it be nothing else than that I\r\npaint a picture.\r\n\r\nWhen I came up to bed half an hour ago, I was deadly sleepy. Now, after\r\nlooking out of the window a little while, my brain is strong and clear,\r\nand I feel as if I could write till morning. But, unfortunately, I have\r\nnothing to write about. And then, if I expect to rise early, I must turn\r\nin betimes. The whole village is asleep, godless metropolitan that I am!\r\nThe lamps on the square without flicker in the wind; there is nothing\r\nabroad but the blue darkness and the smell of the rising tide. I have\r\nspent the whole day on my legs, trudging from one side of the peninsula\r\nto the other. What a trump is old Mrs. M----, to have thought of this\r\nplace! I must write her a letter of passionate thanks. Never before, it\r\nseems to me, have I known pure coast-scenery. Never before have I\r\nrelished the beauties of wave, rock, and cloud. I am filled with a\r\nsensuous ecstasy at the unparalleled life, light, and transparency of\r\nthe air. I am stricken mute with reverent admiration at the stupendous\r\nresources possessed by the ocean in the way of color and sound; and as\r\nyet, I suppose, I have not seen half of them. I came in to supper\r\nhungry, weary, footsore, sunburnt, dirty,--happier, in short, than I\r\nhave been for a twelvemonth. And now for the victories of the brush!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_June 11th._--Another day afoot and also afloat. I resolved this morning\r\nto leave this abominable little tavern. I can't stand my feather-bed\r\nanother night. I determined to find some other prospect than the\r\ntown-pump and the \"drug-store.\" I questioned my host, after breakfast,\r\nas to the possibility of getting lodgings in any of the outlying farms\r\nand cottages. But my host either did not or would not know anything\r\nabout the matter. So I resolved to wander forth and seek my fortune,--to\r\nroam inquisitive through the neighborhood, and appeal to the indigenous\r\nsentiment of hospitality. But never did I see a folk so devoid of this\r\namiable quality. By dinner-time I had given up in despair. After dinner\r\nI strolled down to the harbor, which is close at hand. The brightness\r\nand breeziness of the water tempted me to hire a boat and resume my\r\nexplorations. I procured an old tub, with a short stump of a mast,\r\nwhich, being planted quite in the centre, gave the craft much the\r\nappearance of an inverted mushroom. I made for what I took to be, and\r\nwhat is, an island, lying long and low, some three or four miles, over\r\nagainst the town. I sailed for half an hour directly before the wind,\r\nand at last found myself aground on the shelving beach of a quiet little\r\ncove. _Such_ a little cove! So bright, so still, so warm, so remote\r\nfrom the town, which lay off in the distance, white and semicircular! I\r\nleaped ashore, and dropped my anchor. Before me rose a steep cliff,\r\ncrowned with an old ruined fort or tower. I made my way up, and about to\r\nthe landward entrance. The fort is a hollow old shell. Looking upward\r\nfrom the beach, you see the harmless blue sky through the gaping\r\nloopholes. Its interior is choked with rocks and brambles, and masses of\r\nfallen masonry. I scrambled up to the parapet, and obtained a noble\r\nsea-view. Beyond the broad bay I saw miniature town and country mapped\r\nout before me; and on the other hand, I saw the infinite Atlantic,--over\r\nwhich, by the by, all the pretty things are brought from Paris. I spent\r\nthe whole afternoon in wandering hither and thither over the hills that\r\nencircle the little cove in which I had landed, heedless of the minutes\r\nand my steps, watching the sailing clouds and the cloudy sails on the\r\nhorizon, listening to the musical attrition of the tidal pebbles,\r\nkilling innocuous suckers. The only particular sensation I remember was\r\nthat of being ten years old again, together with a general impression of\r\nSaturday afternoon, of the liberty to go in wading or even swimming, and\r\nof the prospect of limping home in the dusk with a wondrous story of\r\nhaving _almost_ caught a turtle. When I returned, I found--but I know\r\nvery well what I found, and I need hardly repeat it here for my\r\nmortification. Heaven knows I never was a practical character. What\r\nthought I about the tide? There lay the old tub, high and dry, with the\r\nrusty anchor protruding from the flat green stones and the shallow\r\npuddles left by the receding wave. Moving the boat an inch, much more a\r\ndozen yards, was quite beyond my strength. I slowly reascended the\r\ncliff, to see if from its summit any help was discernible. None was\r\nwithin sight; and I was about to go down again in profound dejection,\r\nwhen I saw a trim little sail-boat shoot out from behind a neighboring\r\nbluff, and advance along the shore. I quickened pace. On reaching the\r\nbeach, I found the new-comer standing out about a hundred yards. The man\r\nat the helm appeared to regard me with some interest. With a mute prayer\r\nthat his feeling might be akin to compassion, I invited him by voice and\r\ngesture to make for a little point of rocks a short distance above us,\r\nwhere I proceeded to join him. I told him my story, and he readily took\r\nme aboard. He was a civil old gentleman, of the seafaring sort, who\r\nappeared to be cruising about in the evening breeze for his pleasure. On\r\nlanding, I visited the proprietor of my old tub, related my\r\nmisadventure, and offered to pay damages, if the boat shall turn out in\r\nthe morning to have sustained any. Meanwhile, I suppose, it is held\r\nsecure against the next tidal revolution, however insidious.--But for my\r\nold gentleman. I have decidedly picked up an acquaintance, if not made a\r\nfriend. I gave him a very good cigar; and before we reached home, we had\r\nbecome thoroughly intimate. In exchange for my cigar, he gave me his\r\nname; and there was that in his tone which seemed to imply that I had by\r\nno means the worst of the bargain. His name is Richard Blunt, \"though\r\nmost people,\" he added, \"call me Captain, for short.\" He then proceeded\r\nto inquire my own titles and pretensions. I told him no lies, but I told\r\nhim only half the truth; and if he chooses to indulge mentally in any\r\nromantic understatements, why, he is welcome, and bless his simple\r\nheart! The fact is, that I have broken with the past. I have decided,\r\ncoolly and calmly, as I believe, that it is necessary to my success, or,\r\nat any rate, to my happiness, to abjure for a while my conventional\r\nself, and to assume a simple, natural character. How can a man be simple\r\nand natural who is known to have a hundred thousand a year? That is the\r\nsupreme curse. It's bad enough to have it: to be known to have it, to be\r\nknown only because you have it, is most damnable. I suppose I am too\r\nproud to be successfully rich. Let me see how poverty will serve my\r\nturn. I have taken a fresh start. I have determined to stand upon my\r\nown merits. If they fail me, I shall fall back upon my millions; but\r\nwith God's help I will test them, and see what kind of stuff I am made\r\nof. To be young, to be strong, to be poor,--such, in this blessed\r\nnineteenth century, is the great basis of solid success. I have resolved\r\nto take at least one brief draught from the pure founts of inspiration\r\nof my time. I replied to the Captain with such reservations as a brief\r\nsurvey of these principles dictated. What a luxury to pass in a poor\r\nman's mind for his brother! I begin to respect myself. Thus much the\r\nCaptain knows: that I am an educated man, with a taste for painting;\r\nthat I have come hither for the purpose of cultivating this taste by the\r\nstudy of coast scenery, and for my health. I have reason to believe,\r\nmoreover, that he suspects me of limited means and of being a good deal\r\nof an economist Amen! _Vogue la galere!_ But the point of my story is in\r\nhis very hospitable offer of lodgings. I had been telling him of my ill\r\nsuccess of the morning in the pursuit of the same. He is an odd union of\r\nthe gentleman of the old school and the old-fashioned, hot-headed\r\nmerchant-captain. I suppose that certain traits in these characters are\r\nreadily convertible.\r\n\r\n\"Young man,\" said he, after taking several meditative puffs of his\r\ncigar, \"I don't see the point of your living in a tavern, when there are\r\nfolks about you with more house-room than they know what to do with. A\r\ntavern is only half a house, just as one of these new-fashioned\r\nscrew-propellers is only half a ship. Suppose you walk round and take a\r\nlook at my place. I own quite a respectable house over yonder to the\r\nleft of the town. Do you see that old wharf with the tumble-down\r\nwarehouses, and the long row of elms behind it? I live right in the\r\nmidst of the elms. We have the dearest little garden in the world,\r\nstretching down to the water's edge. It's all as quiet as anything can\r\nbe, short of a graveyard. The back windows, you know, overlook the\r\nharbor; and you can see twenty miles up the bay, and fifty miles out to\r\nsea. You can paint to yourself there the livelong day, with no more fear\r\nof intrusion than if you were out yonder at the light-ship. There's no\r\none but myself and my daughter, who's a perfect lady, Sir. She teaches\r\nmusic in a young ladies' school. You see, money's an object, as they\r\nsay. We have never taken boarders yet, because none ever came in our\r\ntrack; but I guess we can learn the ways. I suppose you've boarded\r\nbefore; you can put us up to a thing or two.\"\r\n\r\nThere was something so kindly and honest in the old man's weather-beaten\r\nface, something so friendly in his address, that I forthwith struck a\r\nbargain with him, subject to his daughter's approval, I am to have her\r\nanswer to-morrow. This same daughter strikes me as rather a dark spot in\r\nthe picture. Teacher in a young ladies' school,--probably the\r\nestablishment of which Mrs. M---- spoke to me. I suppose she's over\r\nthirty. I think I know the species.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_June 12th_, A. M.--I have really nothing to do but to scribble. \"Barkis\r\nis willing.\" Captain Blunt brought me word this morning that his\r\ndaughter smiles propitious. I am to report this evening; but I shall\r\nsend my slender baggage in an hour or two.\r\n\r\nP. M.--Here I am, housed. The house is less than a mile from the inn,\r\nand reached by a very pleasant road, skirting the harbor. At about six\r\no'clock I presented myself. Captain Blunt had described the place. A\r\nvery civil old negress admitted me, and ushered me into the garden,\r\nwhere I found my friends watering their flowers. The old man was in his\r\nhouse-coat and slippers. He gave me a cordial welcome. There is\r\nsomething delightfully easy in his manners,--and in Miss Blunt's, too,\r\nfor that matter. She received me very nicely. The late Mrs. Blunt was\r\nprobably a well-bred woman. As for Miss Blunt's being thirty, she is\r\nabout twenty-four; She wore a fresh white dress, with a violet ribbon at\r\nher neck, and a rosebud in her button-hole,--or whatever corresponds\r\nthereto on the feminine bosom. I thought I discerned in this costume a\r\nvague intention of courtesy, of deference, of celebrating my arrival. I\r\ndon't believe Miss Blunt wears white muslin every day. She shook hands\r\nwith me, and made me a very frank little speech about her hospitality.\r\n\"We have never had any inmates before,\" said she; \"and we are\r\nconsequently new to the business. I don't know what you expect. I hope\r\nyou don't expect a great deal. You must ask for anything you want. If we\r\ncan give it, we shall be very glad to do so; if we can't, I give you\r\nwarning that we shall refuse outright.\" Bravo, Miss Blunt! The best of\r\nit is, that she is decidedly beautiful,--and in the grand manner: tall,\r\nand rather plump. What is the orthodox description of a pretty\r\ngirl?--white and red? Miss Blunt is not a pretty girl, she is a handsome\r\nwoman. She leaves an impression of black and red; that is, she is a\r\nflorid brunette. She has a great deal of wavy black hair, which\r\nencircles her head like a dusky glory, a smoky halo. Her eyebrows, too,\r\nare black, but her eyes themselves are of a rich blue gray, the color of\r\nthose slate-cliffs which I saw yesterday, weltering under the tide. Her\r\nmouth, however, is her strong point. It is very large, and contains the\r\nfinest row of teeth in all this weary world. Her smile is eminently\r\nintelligent. Her chin is full, and somewhat heavy. All this is a\r\ntolerable catalogue, but no picture. I have been tormenting my brain to\r\ndiscover whether it was her coloring or her form that impressed me most.\r\nFruitless speculation! Seriously, I think it was neither; it was her\r\nmovement. She walks a queen. It was the conscious poise of her head, the\r\nunconscious \"hang\" of her arms, the careless grace and dignity with\r\nwhich she lingered along the garden-path, smelling a red red rose! She\r\nhas very little to say, apparently; but when she speaks, it is to the\r\npoint, and if the point suggests it, with a very sweet smile. Indeed, if\r\nshe is not talkative, it is not from timidity. Is it from indifference?\r\nTime will elucidate this, as well as other matters. I cling to the\r\nhypothesis that she is amiable. She is, moreover, intelligent; she is\r\nprobably quite reserved; and she is possibly very proud. She is, in\r\nshort, a woman of character. There you are, Miss Blunt, at full\r\nlength,--emphatically the portrait of a lady. After tea, she gave us\r\nsome music in the parlor. I confess that I was more taken with the\r\npicture of the dusky little room, lighted by the single candle on the\r\npiano, and by the _effect_ of Miss Blunt's performance, than with its\r\nmeaning. She appears to possess a very brilliant touch.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_June 18th._--I have now been here almost a week. I occupy two very\r\npleasant rooms. My painting-room is a vast and rather bare apartment,\r\nwith a very good southern light. I have decked it out with a few old\r\nprints and sketches, and have already grown very fond of it. When I had\r\ndisposed my artistic odds and ends in as picturesque a fashion as\r\npossible, I called in my hosts. The Captain looked about silently for\r\nsome moments, and then inquired hopefully if I had ever tried my hand at\r\na ship. On learning that I had not yet got to ships, he relapsed into a\r\ndeferential silence. His daughter smiled and questioned very graciously,\r\nand called everything beautiful and delightful; which rather\r\ndisappointed me, as I had taken her to be a woman of some originality.\r\nShe is rather a puzzle;--or is she, indeed, a very commonplace person,\r\nand the fault in me, who am forever taking women to mean a great deal\r\nmore than their Maker intended? Regarding Miss Blunt I have collected a\r\nfew facts. She is not twenty-four, but twenty-seven years old. She has\r\ntaught music ever since she was twenty, in a large boarding-school just\r\nout of the town, where she originally got her education. Her salary in\r\nthis establishment, which is, I believe, a tolerably flourishing one,\r\nand the proceeds of a few additional lessons, constitute the chief\r\nrevenues of the household. But Blunt fortunately owns his house, and his\r\nneeds and habits are of the simplest kind. What does he or his daughter\r\nknow of the great worldly theory of necessities, the great worldly scale\r\nof pleasures? Miss Blunt's only luxuries are a subscription to the\r\ncirculating library, and an occasional walk on the beach, which, like\r\none of Miss Bronte's heroines, she paces in company with an old\r\nNewfoundland dog. I am afraid she is sadly ignorant. She reads nothing\r\nbut novels. I am bound to believe, however, that she has derived from\r\nthe perusal of these works a certain practical science of her own. \"I\r\nread all the novels I can get,\" she said yesterday; \"but I only like the\r\ngood ones. I do so like Zanoni, which I have just finished.\" I must set\r\nher to work at some of the masters. I should like some of those fretful\r\nNew-York heiresses to see how this woman lives. I wish, too, that half a\r\ndozen of _ces messieurs_ of the clubs might take a peep at the present\r\nway of life of their humble servant. We breakfast at eight o'clock.\r\nImmediately afterwards, Miss Blunt, in a shabby old bonnet and shawl,\r\nstarts off to school. If the weather is fine, the Captain goes out\r\na-fishing, and I am left to my own devices. Twice I have accompanied the\r\nold man. The second time I was lucky enough to catch a big blue-fish,\r\nwhich we had for dinner. The Captain is an excellent specimen of the\r\nsturdy navigator, with his loose blue clothes, his ultra-divergent legs,\r\nhis crisp white hair, and his jolly thick-skinned visage. He comes of a\r\nseafaring English race. There is more or less of the ship's cabin in the\r\ngeneral aspect of this antiquated house. I have heard the winds whistle\r\nabout its walls, on two or three occasions, in true mid-ocean style. And\r\nthen the illusion is heightened, somehow or other, by the extraordinary\r\nintensity of the light. My painting-room is a grand observatory of the\r\nclouds. I sit by the half-hour, watching them sail past my high,\r\nuncurtained windows. At the back part of the room, something tells you\r\nthat they belong to an ocean sky; and there, in truth, as you draw\r\nnearer, you behold the vast, gray complement of sea. This quarter of the\r\ntown is perfectly quiet. Human activity seems to have passed over it,\r\nnever again to return, and to have left a kind of deposit of melancholy\r\nresignation. The streets are clean, bright, and airy; but this fact\r\nseems only to add to the intense sobriety. It implies that the\r\nunobstructed heavens are in the secret of their decline. There is\r\nsomething ghostly in the perpetual stillness. We frequently hear the\r\nrattling of the yards and the issuing of orders on the barks and\r\nschooners anchored out in the harbor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_June 28th._--My experiment works far better than I had hoped. I am\r\nthoroughly at my ease; my peace of mind quite passeth understanding. I\r\nwork diligently; I have none but pleasant thoughts. The past has almost\r\nlost its terrors. For a week now I have been out sketching daily. The\r\nCaptain carries me to a certain point on the shore of the harbor, I\r\ndisembark and strike across the fields to a spot where I have\r\nestablished a kind of _rendezvous_ with a particular effect of rock and\r\nshadow, which has been tolerably faithful to its appointment. Here I set\r\nup my easel, and paint till sunset. Then I retrace my steps and meet the\r\nboat. I am in every way much encouraged. The horizon of my work grows\r\nperceptibly wider. And then I am inexpressibly happy in the conviction\r\nthat I am not wholly unfit for a life of (moderate) labor and\r\n(comparative) privation. I am quite in love with my poverty, if I may\r\ncall it so. As why should I not? At this rate I don't spend eight\r\nhundred a year.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_July 12th._--We have been having a week of bad weather: constant rain,\r\nnight and day. This is certainly at once the brightest and the blackest\r\nspot in New England. The skies can smile, assuredly; but how they can\r\nfrown! I have been painting rather languidly, and at a great\r\ndisadvantage, at my window.... Through all this pouring and pattering,\r\nMiss Blunt sallies forth to her pupils. She envelops her beautiful head\r\nin a great woollen hood, her beautiful figure in a kind of feminine\r\nMackintosh; her feet she puts into heavy clogs, and over the whole she\r\nbalances a cotton umbrella. When she comes home, with the rain-drops\r\nglistening on her red cheeks and her dark lashes, her cloak bespattered\r\nwith mud, and her hands red with the cool damp, she is a profoundly\r\nwholesome spectacle. I never fail to make her a very low bow, for which\r\nshe repays me with an extraordinary smile. This working-day side of her\r\ncharacter is what especially pleases me in Miss Blunt. This holy\r\nworking-dress of loveliness and dignity sits upon her with the\r\nsimplicity of an antique drapery. Little use has she for whalebones and\r\nfurbelows. What a poetry there is, after all, in red hands! I kiss\r\nyours, Mademoiselle. I do so because you are self-helpful; because you\r\nearn your living; because you are honest, simple, and ignorant (for a\r\nsensible woman, that is); because you speak and act to the point;\r\nbecause, in short, you are so unlike--certain of your sisters.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_July 16th._--On Monday it cleared up generously. When I went to my\r\nwindow, on rising, I found sky and sea looking, for their brightness and\r\nfreshness, like a clever English water-color. The ocean is of a deep\r\npurple blue; above it, the pure, bright sky looks pale, though it bends\r\nwith an infinite depth over the inland horizon. Here and there on the\r\ndark breezy water gleams the white cap of a wave, or flaps the white\r\ncloak of a fishing-boat. I have been sketching sedulously; I have\r\ndiscovered, within a couple of miles' walk, a large, lonely pond, set in\r\nquite a grand landscape of barren rocks and grassy slopes. At one\r\nextremity is a broad outlook on the open sea; at the other, deep buried\r\nin the foliage of an apple-orchard, stands an old haunted-looking\r\nfarm-house. To the west of the pond is a wide expanse of rock and grass,\r\nof beach and marsh. The sheep browse over it as upon a Highland moor.\r\nExcept a few stunted firs and cedars, there is not a tree in sight. When\r\nI want shade, I seek it in the shelter of one of the great mossy\r\nboulders which upheave their scintillating shoulders to the sun, or of\r\nthe long shallow dells where a tangle of blackberry-bushes hedges about\r\na sky-reflecting pool. I have encamped over against a plain, brown\r\nhillside, which, with laborious patience, I am transferring to canvas;\r\nand as we have now had the same clear sky for several days, I have\r\nalmost finished quite a satisfactory little study. I go forth\r\nimmediately after breakfast. Miss Blunt furnishes me with a napkin full\r\nof bread and cold meat, which at the noonday hours, in my sunny\r\nsolitude, within sight of the slumbering ocean, I voraciously convey to\r\nmy lips with my discolored fingers. At seven o'clock I return to tea, at\r\nwhich repast we each tell the story of our day's work. For poor Miss\r\nBlunt, it is day after day the same story: a wearisome round of visits\r\nto the school, and to the houses of the mayor, the parson, the butcher,\r\nthe baker, whose young ladies, of course, all receive instruction on the\r\npiano. But she doesn't complain, nor, indeed, does she look very weary.\r\nWhen she has put on a fresh calico dress for tea, and arranged her hair\r\nanew, and with these improvements flits about with that quiet hither and\r\nthither of her gentle footsteps, preparing our evening meal, peeping\r\ninto the teapot, cutting the solid loaf,--or when, sitting down on the\r\nlow door-step, she reads out select scraps from the evening paper,--or\r\nelse, when, tea being over, she folds her arms, (an attitude which\r\nbecomes her mightily,) and, still sitting on the door-step, gossips away\r\nthe evening in comfortable idleness, while her father and I indulge in\r\nthe fragrant pipe, and watch the lights shining out, one by one, in\r\ndifferent quarters of the darkling bay: at these moments she is as\r\npretty, as cheerful, as careless as it becomes a sensible woman to be.\r\nWhat a pride the Captain takes in his daughter! And she, in return, how\r\nperfect is her devotion to the old man! He is proud of her grace, of\r\nher tact, of her good sense, of her wit, such as it is. He thinks her to\r\nbe the most accomplished of women. He waits upon her as if, instead of\r\nhis old familiar Esther, she were a newly inducted daughter-in-law. And\r\nindeed, if I were his own son, he could not be kinder to me. They are\r\ncertainly--nay, why should I not say it?--_we_ are certainly a very\r\nhappy little household. Will it last forever? I say _we_, because both\r\nfather and daughter have given me a hundred assurances--he direct, and\r\nshe, if I don't flatter myself, after the manner of her sex,\r\nindirect--that I am already a valued friend. It is natural enough that I\r\nshould have gained their good-will. They have received at my hands\r\ninveterate courtesy. The way to the old man's heart is through a studied\r\nconsideration of his daughter. He knows, I imagine, that I admire Miss\r\nBlunt. But if I should at any time fall below the mark of ceremony, I\r\nshould have an account to settle with him. All this is as it should be.\r\nWhen people have to economize with the dollars and cents, they have a\r\nright to be splendid in their feelings. I have prided myself not a\r\nlittle on my good manners towards my hostess. That my bearing has been\r\nwithout reproach is, however, a fact which I do not, in any degree, set\r\ndown here to my credit; for I would defy the most impertinent of men\r\n(whoever he is) to forget himself with this young lady, without leave\r\nunmistakably given. Those deep, dark eyes have a strong prohibitory\r\nforce. I record the circumstance simply because in future years, when my\r\ncharming friend shall have become a distant shadow, it will be pleasant,\r\nin turning over these pages, to find written testimony to a number of\r\npoints which I shall be apt to charge solely upon my imagination. I\r\nwonder whether Miss Blunt, in days to come, referring to the tables of\r\nher memory for some trivial matter-of-fact, some prosaic date or\r\nhalf-buried landmark, will also encounter this little secret of ours, as\r\nI may call it,--will decipher an old faint note to this effect, overlaid\r\nwith the memoranda of intervening years. Of course she will. Sentiment\r\naside, she is a woman of an excellent memory. Whether she forgives or\r\nnot I know not; but she certainly doesn't forget. Doubtless, virtue is\r\nits own reward; but there is a double satisfaction in being polite to a\r\nperson on whom it _tells_. Another reason for my pleasant relations with\r\nthe Captain is, that I afford him a chance to rub up his rusty old\r\ncosmopolitanism, and trot out his little scraps of old-fashioned\r\nreading, some of which are very curious. It is a great treat for him to\r\nspin his threadbare yarns over again to a sympathetic listener. These\r\nwarm July evenings, in the sweet-smelling garden, are just the proper\r\nsetting for his amiable garrulities. An odd enough relation subsists\r\nbetween us on this point. Like many gentlemen of his calling, the\r\nCaptain is harassed by an irresistible desire to romance, even on the\r\nleast promising themes; and it is vastly amusing to observe how he will\r\nauscultate, as it were, his auditor's inmost mood, to ascertain whether\r\nit is prepared for the absorption of his insidious fibs. Sometimes they\r\nperish utterly in the transition: they are very pretty, I conceive, in\r\nthe deep and briny well of the Captain's fancy; but they won't bear\r\nbeing transplanted into the shallow inland lakes of my land-bred\r\napprehension. At other times, the auditor being in a dreamy,\r\nsentimental, and altogether unprincipled mood, he will drink the old\r\nman's salt-water by the bucketful and feel none the worse for it. Which\r\nis the worse, wilfully to tell, or wilfully to believe, a pretty little\r\nfalsehood which will not hurt any one? I suppose you can't believe\r\nwilfully; you only pretend to believe. My part of the game, therefore,\r\nis certainly as bad as the Captain's. Perhaps I take kindly to his\r\nbeautiful perversions of fact, because I am myself engaged in one,\r\nbecause I am sailing under false colors of the deepest dye. I wonder\r\nwhether my friends have any suspicion of the real state of the case. How\r\nshould they? I fancy, that, on the whole, I play my part pretty well. I\r\nam delighted to find it come so easy. I do not mean that I experience\r\nlittle difficulty in foregoing my hundred petty elegancies and\r\nluxuries,--for to these, thank Heaven, I was not so indissolubly wedded\r\nthat one wholesome shock could not loosen my bonds,--but that I manage\r\nmore cleverly than I expected to stifle those innumerable tacit\r\nallusions which might serve effectually to belie my character.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Sunday, July 20th._--This has been a very pleasant day for me; although\r\nin it, of course, I have done no manner of work. I had this morning a\r\ndelightful _tete-a-tete_ with my hostess. She had sprained her ankle,\r\ncoming down stairs; and so, instead of going forth to Sunday school and\r\nto meeting, she was obliged to remain at home on the sofa. The Captain,\r\nwho is of a very punctilious piety, went off alone. When I came into the\r\nparlor, as the church-bells were ringing, Miss Blunt asked me if I never\r\nwent to meeting.\r\n\r\n\"Never when there is anything better to do at home,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"What is better than going to church?\" she asked, with charming\r\nsimplicity.\r\n\r\nShe was reclining on the sofa, with her foot on a pillow, and her Bible\r\nin her lap. She looked by no means afflicted at having to be absent from\r\ndivine service; and, instead of answering her question, I took the\r\nliberty of telling her so.\r\n\r\n\"I _am_ sorry to be absent,\" said she. \"You know it's my only festival\r\nin the week.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you look upon it as a festival,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it a pleasure to meet one's acquaintance? I confess I am never\r\ndeeply interested in the sermon, and I very much dislike teaching the\r\nchildren; but I like wearing my best bonnet, and singing in the choir,\r\nand walking part of the way home with\"----\r\n\r\n\"With whom?\"\r\n\r\n\"With any one who offers to walk with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"With Mr. Johnson, for instance,\" said I.\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson is a young lawyer in the village, who calls here once a\r\nweek, and whose attentions to Miss Blunt have been remarked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she answered, \"Mr. Johnson will do as an instance.\"\r\n\r\n\"How he will miss you!\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose he will. We sing off the same book. What are you laughing at?\r\nHe kindly permits me to hold the book, while he stands with his hands in\r\nhis pockets. Last Sunday I quite lost patience. 'Mr. Johnson,' said I,\r\n'do hold the book! Where are your manners?' He burst out laughing in the\r\nmidst of the reading. He will certainly have to hold the book to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a 'masterful soul' he is! I suppose he will call after meeting.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps he will. I hope so.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope he won't,\" said I, roundly, \"I am going to sit down here and\r\ntalk to you, and I wish our _tete-a-tete_ not to be interrupted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you anything particular to say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing so particular as Mr. Johnson, perhaps.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Blunt has a very pretty affectation of being more matter-of-fact\r\nthan she really is.\r\n\r\n\"His rights, then,\" said she, \"are paramount to yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you admit that he has rights?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all. I simply assert that you have none.\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon. I have claims which I mean to enforce. I have a\r\nclaim upon your undivided attention, when I pay you a morning call.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your claim is certainly answered. Have I been uncivil, pray?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not uncivil, perhaps, but inconsiderate. You have been sighing for the\r\ncompany of a third person, which you can't expect me to relish.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not, pray? If I, a lady, can put up with Mr. Johnson's society, why\r\nshouldn't you, one of his own sex?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because he is so outrageously conceited. You, as a lady, or at any rate\r\nas a woman, like conceited men.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, yes; I have no doubt that I, as a woman, have all kinds of improper\r\ntastes. That's an old story.\"\r\n\r\n\"Admit, at any rate, that our friend is conceited.\"\r\n\r\n\"Admit it? Why, I have said so a hundred times. I have told him so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed! It has come to that, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"To what, pray?\"\r\n\r\n\"To that critical point in the friendship of a lady and gentleman, when\r\nthey bring against each other all kinds of delightful charges of moral\r\nobliquity. Take care, Miss Blunt! A couple of intelligent\r\nNew-Englanders, of opposite sex, young, unmarried, are pretty far gone,\r\nwhen they begin morally to reprobate each other. So you told Mr. Johnson\r\nthat he is conceited? And I suppose you added, that he was also\r\ndreadfully satirical and skeptical? What was his rejoinder? Let me see.\r\nDid he ever tell you that you were a little bit affected?\"\r\n\r\n\"No: he left that for you to say, in this very ingenious manner. Thank\r\nyou, Sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"He left it for me to deny, which is a great deal prettier. Do you think\r\nthe manner ingenious?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think the matter, considering the day and hour, very profane, Mr.\r\nLocksley. Suppose you go away and let me read my Bible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile,\" I asked, \"what shall I do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Go and read yours, if you have one.\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't.\"\r\n\r\nI was nevertheless compelled to retire, with the promise of a second\r\naudience in half an hour. Poor Miss Blunt owes it to her conscience to\r\nread a certain number of chapters. What a pure and upright soul she is!\r\nAnd what an edifying spectacle is much of our feminine piety! Women find\r\na place for everything in their commodious little minds, just as they do\r\nin their wonderfully subdivided trunks, when they go on a journey. I\r\nhave no doubt that this young lady stows away her religion in a corner,\r\njust as she does her Sunday bonnet,--and, when the proper moment comes,\r\ndraws it forth, and reflects while she assumes it before the glass, and\r\nblows away the strictly imaginary dust; for what worldly impurity can\r\npenetrate through half a dozen layers of cambric and tissue-paper? Dear\r\nme, what a comfort it is to have a nice, fresh, holiday faith!--When I\r\nreturned to the parlor, Miss Blunt was still sitting with her Bible in\r\nher lap. Somehow or other, I no longer felt in the mood for jesting. So\r\nI asked her soberly what she had been reading. Soberly she answered me.\r\nShe inquired how I had spent my half-hour.\r\n\r\n\"In thinking good Sabbath thoughts,\" I said. \"I have been walking in the\r\ngarden.\" And then I spoke my mind. \"I have been thanking Heaven that it\r\nhas led me, a poor, friendless wanderer, into so peaceful an anchorage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you, then, so poor and friendless?\" asked Miss Blunt, quite\r\nabruptly.\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever hear of an art-student under thirty who wasn't poor?\" I\r\nanswered. \"Upon my word, I have yet to sell my first picture. Then, as\r\nfor being friendless, there are not five people in the world who really\r\ncare for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Really_ care? I am afraid you look too close. And then I think five\r\ngood friends is a very large number. I think myself very well off with a\r\ncouple. But if you are friendless, it's probably your own fault.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps it is,\" said I, sitting down in the rocking-chair; \"and yet,\r\nperhaps, it isn't. Have you found me so very repulsive? Haven't you, on\r\nthe contrary, found me rather sociable?\"\r\n\r\nShe folded her arms, and quietly looked at me for a moment, before\r\nanswering. I shouldn't wonder if I blushed a little.\r\n\r\n\"You want a compliment, Mr. Locksley; that's the long and short of it. I\r\nhave not paid you a compliment since you have been here. How you must\r\nhave suffered! But it's a pity you couldn't have waited awhile longer,\r\ninstead of beginning to angle with that very clumsy bait. For an artist,\r\nyou are very inartistic. Men never know how to wait. 'Have I found you\r\nrepulsive? haven't I found you sociable?' Perhaps, after all,\r\nconsidering what I have in my mind, it is as well that you asked for\r\nyour compliment. I have found you charming. I say it freely; and yet I\r\nsay, with equal sincerity, that I fancy very few others would find you\r\nso. I can say decidedly that you are not sociable. You are entirely too\r\nparticular. You are considerate of me, because you know that I know that\r\nyou are so. There's the rub, you see: I know that you know that I know\r\nit. Don't interrupt me; I am going to be eloquent. I want you to\r\nunderstand why I don't consider you sociable. You call Mr. Johnson\r\nconceited; but, really, I don't believe he's nearly as conceited as\r\nyourself. You are too conceited to be sociable; he is not. I am an\r\nobscure, weak-minded woman,--weak-minded, you know, compared with men. I\r\ncan be patronized,--yes, that's the word. Would you be equally amiable\r\nwith a person as strong, as clear-sighted as yourself, with a person\r\nequally averse with yourself to being under an obligation? I think not.\r\nOf course it's delightful to charm people. Who wouldn't? There is no\r\nharm in it, as long as the charmer does not sit up for a public\r\nbenefactor. If I were a man, a clever man like yourself, who had seen\r\nthe world, who was not to be charmed and encouraged, but to be convinced\r\nand refuted, would you be equally amiable? It will perhaps seem absurd\r\nto you, and it will certainly seem egotistical, but I consider myself\r\nsociable, for all that I have only a couple of friends,--my father and\r\nthe principal of the school. That is, I mingle with women without any\r\nsecond thought. Not that I wish you to do so: on the contrary, if the\r\ncontrary is natural to you. But I don't believe you mingle in the same\r\nway with men. You may ask me what I know about it. Of course I know\r\nnothing: I simply guess. When I have done, indeed, I mean to beg your\r\npardon for all I have said; but until then, give me a chance. You are\r\nincapable of listening deferentially to stupid, bigoted persons. I am\r\nnot. I do it every day. Ah, you have no idea of what nice manners I have\r\nin the exercise of my profession! Every day I have occasion to pocket my\r\npride and to stifle my precious sense of the ridiculous,--of which, of\r\ncourse, you think I haven't a bit. It is, for instance, a constant\r\nvexation to me to be poor. It makes me frequently hate rich women; it\r\nmakes me despise poor ones. I don't know whether you suffer acutely from\r\nthe narrowness of your own means; but if you do, I dare say you shun\r\nrich men. I don't. I like to go into rich people's houses, and to be\r\nvery polite to the ladies of the house, especially if they are very\r\nwell-dressed and ignorant and vulgar. All women are like me in this\r\nrespect; and all men more or less like you. That is, after all, the text\r\nof my sermon. Compared with us, it has always seemed to me that you are\r\narrant cowards,--that we alone are brave. To be sociable, you must have\r\na great deal of pluck. You are too fine a gentleman. Go and teach\r\nschool, or open a corner grocery, or sit in a law-office all day,\r\nwaiting for clients: _then_ you will be sociable. As yet, you are only\r\nagreeable. It _is_ your own fault, if people don't care for you. You\r\ndon't care for them. That you should be indifferent to their applause is\r\nall very well; but you don't care for their indifference. You are\r\namiable, you are very kind, and you are also very lazy. You consider\r\nthat you are working now, don't you? Many persons would not call it\r\nwork.\"\r\n\r\nIt was now certainly my turn to fold my arms.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" added my companion, as I did so, \"I beg your pardon.\"\r\n\r\n\"This was certainly worth waiting for,\" said I. \"I don't know what\r\nanswer to make. My head swims. I don't know whether you have been\r\nattacking me or praising me. So you advise me to open a corner grocery,\r\ndo you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I advise you to do something that will make you a little less\r\nsatirical. You had better marry, for instance.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Je ne demande pas mieux._ Will you have me? I can't afford it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Marry a rich woman.\"\r\n\r\nI shook my head.\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" asked Miss Blunt. \"Because people would accuse you of being\r\nmercenary? What of that? I mean to marry the first rich man who offers.\r\nDo you know that I am tired of living alone in this weary old way,\r\nteaching little girls their gamut, and turning and patching my dresses?\r\nI mean to marry the first man who offers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Even if he is poor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Even if he is poor, ugly, and stupid.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am your man, then. Would you take me, if I were to offer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Try and see.\"\r\n\r\n\"Must I get upon my knees?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you need not even do that. Am I not on mine? It would be too fine\r\nan irony. Remain as you are, lounging back in your chair, with your\r\nthumbs in your waistcoat.\"\r\n\r\nIf I were writing a romance now, instead of transcribing facts, I would\r\nsay that I knew not what might have happened at this juncture, had not\r\nthe door opened and admitted the Captain and Mr. Johnson. The latter was\r\nin the highest spirits.\r\n\r\n\"How are you, Miss Esther? So you have been breaking your leg, eh? How\r\nare you, Mr. Locksley? I wish I were a doctor now. Which is it, right or\r\nleft?\"\r\n\r\nIn this simple fashion he made himself agreeable to Miss Blunt. He\r\nstopped to dinner and talked without ceasing. Whether our hostess had\r\ntalked herself out in her very animated address to myself an hour\r\nbefore, or whether she preferred to oppose no obstacle to Mr. Johnson's\r\nfluency, or whether she was indifferent to him, I know not; but she held\r\nher tongue with that easy grace, that charming tacit intimation of \"We\r\ncould, an we would,\" of which she is so perfect a mistress. This very\r\ninteresting woman has a number of pretty traits in common with her\r\ntown-bred sisters; only, whereas in these they are laboriously acquired,\r\nin her they are severely natural. I am sure, that, if I were to plant\r\nher in Madison Square to-morrow, she would, after one quick,\r\nall-compassing glance, assume the _nil admirari_ in a manner to drive\r\nthe greatest lady of them all to despair. Johnson is a man of excellent\r\nintentions, but no taste. Two or three times I looked at Miss Blunt to\r\nsee what impression his sallies were making upon her. They seemed to\r\nproduce none whatever. But I know better, _moi_. Not one of them escaped\r\nher. But I suppose she said to herself that her impressions on this\r\npoint were no business of mine. Perhaps she was right. It is a\r\ndisagreeable word to use of a woman you admire; but I can't help\r\nfancying that she has been a little _soured_. By what? Who shall say? By\r\nsome old love affair, perhaps.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_July 24th._--This evening the Captain and I took a half-hour's turn\r\nabout the harbor. I asked him frankly, as a friend, whether Johnson\r\nwants to marry his daughter.\r\n\r\n\"I guess he does,\" said the old man; \"and yet I hope he don't. You know\r\nwhat he is: he's smart, promising, and already sufficiently well off.\r\nBut somehow he isn't for a man what my Esther is for a woman.\"\r\n\r\n\"That he isn't!\" said I; \"and honestly, Captain Blunt, I don't know who\r\nis\"----\r\n\r\n\"Unless it's yourself,\" said the Captain.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you. I know a great many ways in which Mr. Johnson is more worthy\r\nof her than I.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I know, one in which you are more worthy of her than he,--that is,\r\nin being what we used to call a gentleman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Esther made him sufficiently welcome in her quiet way, on Sunday,\"\r\nI rejoined.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, she respects him,\" said Blunt. \"As she's situated, she might marry\r\nhim on that. You see, she's weary of hearing little girls drum on the\r\npiano. With her ear for music,\" added the Captain, \"I wonder she has\r\nborne it so long.\"\r\n\r\n\"She is certainly meant for better things,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" answered the Captain, who has an honest habit of deprecating\r\nyour agreement, when it occurs to him that he has obtained it for\r\nsentiments which fall somewhat short of the stoical,--\"well,\" said he,\r\nwith a very dry expression of mouth, \"she's born to do her duty. We are\r\nall of us born for that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes our duty is rather dreary,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"So it be; but what's the help for it? I don't want to die without\r\nseeing my daughter provided for. What she makes by teaching is a pretty\r\nslim subsistence. There was a time when I thought she was going to be\r\nfixed for life, but it all blew over. There was a young fellow here from\r\ndown Boston way, who came about as near to it as you can come, when you\r\nactually don't. He and Esther were excellent friends. One day Esther\r\ncame up to me, and looked me in the face, and told me she was engaged.\r\n\r\n\"'Who to?' says I, though of course I knew, and Esther told me as much.\r\n'When do you expect to marry?' I asked.\r\n\r\n\"'When John grows rich enough,' says she.\r\n\r\n\"'When will that be?'\r\n\r\n\"'It may not be for years,' said poor Esther.\r\n\r\n\"A whole year passed, and, as far as I could see, the young man came no\r\nnearer to his fortune. He was forever running to and fro between this\r\nplace and Boston. I asked no questions, because I knew that my poor girl\r\nwished it so. But at last, one day, I began to think it was time to take\r\nan observation, and see whereabouts we stood.\r\n\r\n\"'Has John made his fortune yet?' I asked.\r\n\r\n\"'I don't know, father,' said Esther.\r\n\r\n\"'When are you to be married?'\r\n\r\n\"'Never!' said my poor little girl, and burst into tears. 'Please ask me\r\nno questions,' said she. 'Our engagement is over. Ask me no questions.'\r\n\r\n\"'Tell me one thing,' said I: 'where is that d----d scoundrel who has\r\nbroken my daughter's heart?'\r\n\r\n\"You should have seen the look she gave me.\r\n\r\n\"'Broken my heart, Sir? You are very much mistaken. I don't know who you\r\nmean.'\r\n\r\n\"'I mean John Banister,' said I. That was his name.\r\n\r\n\"'I believe Mr. Banister is in China,' says Esther, as grand as the\r\nQueen of Sheba. And there was an end of it. I never learnt the ins and\r\nouts of it. I have been told that Banister is accumulating money very\r\nfast in the China trade.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_August 7th._--I have made no entry for more than a fortnight. They tell\r\nme I have been very ill; and I find no difficulty in believing them. I\r\nsuppose I took cold, sitting out so late, sketching. At all events, I\r\nhave had a mild intermittent fever. I have slept so much, however, that\r\nthe time has seemed rather short. I have been tenderly nursed by this\r\nkind old gentleman, his daughter, and his maid-servant. God bless them,\r\none and all! I say his daughter, because old Dorothy informs me that for\r\nhalf an hour one morning, at dawn, after a night during which I had been\r\nvery feeble, Miss Blunt relieved guard at my bedside, while I lay wrapt\r\nin brutal slumber. It is very jolly to see sky and ocean once again. I\r\nhave got myself into my easy-chair by the open window, with my shutters\r\nclosed and the lattice open; and here I sit with my book on my knee,\r\nscratching away feebly enough. Now and then I peep from my cool, dark\r\nsick-chamber out into the world of light. High noon at midsummer! What a\r\nspectacle! There are no clouds in the sky, no waves on the ocean. The\r\nsun has it all to himself. To look long at the garden makes the eyes\r\nwater. And we--\"Hobbs, Nobbs, Stokes, and Nokes\"--propose to paint that\r\nkingdom of light. _Allons, donc!_\r\n\r\nThe loveliest of women has just tapped, and come in with a plate of\r\nearly peaches. The peaches are of a gorgeous color and plumpness; but\r\nMiss Blunt looks pale and thin. The hot weather doesn't agree with her.\r\nShe is overworked. Confound it! Of course I thanked her warmly for her\r\nattentions during my illness. She disclaims all gratitude, and refers me\r\nto her father and Mrs. Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"I allude more especially,\" said I, \"to that little hour at the end of a\r\nweary night, when you stole in like a kind of moral Aurora, and drove\r\naway the shadows from my brain. That morning, you know, I began to get\r\nbetter.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was indeed a very little hour,\" said Miss Blunt. \"It was about ten\r\nminutes.\" And then she began to scold me for presuming to touch a pen\r\nduring my convalescence. She laughs at me, indeed, for keeping a diary\r\nat all. \"Of all things,\" cried she, \"a sentimental man is the most\r\ndespicable.\"\r\n\r\nI confess I was somewhat nettled. The thrust seemed gratuitous.\r\n\r\n\"Of all things,\" I answered, \"a woman without sentiment is the most\r\nunlovely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sentiment and loveliness are all very well, when you have time for\r\nthem,\" said Miss Blunt. \"I haven't. I'm not rich enough. Good morning.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking of another woman, I would say that she flounced out of the\r\nroom. But such was the gait of Juno, when she moved stiffly over the\r\ngrass from where Paris stood with Venus holding the apple, gathering up\r\nher divine vestment, and leaving the others to guess at her face----\r\n\r\nJuno has just come back to say that she forgot what she came for half an\r\nhour ago. What will I be pleased to like for dinner?\r\n\r\n\"I have just been writing in my diary that you flounced out of the\r\nroom,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Have you, indeed? Now you can write that I have bounced in. There's a\r\nnice cold chicken down-stairs,\" etc., etc.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_August 14th._--This afternoon I sent for a light wagon, and treated\r\nMiss Blunt to a drive. We went successively over the three beaches. What\r\na time we had, coming home! I shall never forget that hard trot over\r\nWeston's Beach. The tide was very low; and we had the whole glittering,\r\nweltering strand to ourselves. There was a heavy blow yesterday, which\r\nhad not yet subsided; and the waves had been lashed into a magnificent\r\nfury. Trot, trot, trot, trot, we trundled over the hard sand. The sound\r\nof the horse's hoofs rang out sharp against the monotone of the\r\nthunderous surf, as we drew nearer and nearer to the long line of the\r\ncliffs. At our left, almost from the lofty zenith of the pale evening\r\nsky to the high western horizon of the tumultuous dark-green sea, was\r\nsuspended, so to speak, one of those gorgeous vertical sunsets that\r\nTurner loved so well. It was a splendid confusion of purple and green\r\nand gold,--the clouds flying and flowing in the wind like the folds of a\r\nmighty banner borne by some triumphal fleet whose prows were not visible\r\nabove the long chain of mountainous waves. As we reached the point where\r\nthe cliffs plunge down upon the beach, I pulled up, and we remained for\r\nsome moments looking out along the low, brown, obstinate barrier at\r\nwhose feet the impetuous waters were rolling themselves into powder.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_August 17th._--This evening, as I lighted my bedroom candle, I saw that\r\nthe Captain had something to say to me. So I waited below until the old\r\nman and his daughter had performed their usual picturesque embrace, and\r\nthe latter had given me that hand-shake and that smile which I never\r\nfailed to exact.\r\n\r\n\"Johnson has got his discharge,\" said the old man, when he had heard,\r\nhis daughter's door close up-stairs.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\nHe pointed with his thumbs to the room above, where we heard, through\r\nthe thin partition, the movement of Miss Blunt's light step.\r\n\r\n\"You mean that he has proposed to Miss Esther?\"\r\n\r\nThe Captain nodded.\r\n\r\n\"And has been refused?\"\r\n\r\n\"Flat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor fellow!\" said I, very honestly. \"Did he tell you himself?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, with tears in his eyes. He wanted me to speak for him. I told him\r\nit was no use. Then he began to say hard things of my poor girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"What kind of things?\"\r\n\r\n\"A pack of falsehoods. He says she has no heart. She has promised always\r\nto regard him as a friend: it's more than I will, hang him!\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor fellow!\" said I; and now, as I write, I can only repeat,\r\nconsidering what a hope was here broken, Poor fellow!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_August 23d._--I have been lounging about all day, thinking of it,\r\ndreaming of it, spooning over it, as they say. This is a decided waste\r\nof time. I think, accordingly, the best thing for me to do is, to sit\r\ndown and lay the ghost by writing out my story.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday evening Miss Blunt happened to intimate that she had a\r\nholiday on the morrow, it being the birthday of the lady in whose\r\nestablishment she teaches.\r\n\r\n\"There is to be a tea-party at four o'clock in the afternoon for the\r\nresident pupils and teachers,\" said Miss Esther. \"Tea at four! what do\r\nyou think of that? And then there is to be a speech-making by the\r\nsmartest young lady. As my services are not required, I propose to be\r\nabsent. Suppose, father, you take us out in your boat. Will you come,\r\nMr. Locksley? We shall have a nice little picnic. Let us go over to old\r\nFort Pudding, across the bay. We will take our dinner with us, and send\r\nDorothy to spend the day with her sister, and put the house-key in our\r\npocket, and not come home till we please.\"\r\n\r\nI warmly espoused the project, and it was accordingly carried into\r\nexecution the next morning, when, at about ten o'clock, we pushed off\r\nfrom our little wharf at the garden-foot. It was a perfect summer's day:\r\nI can say no more for it. We made a quiet run over to the point of our\r\ndestination. I shall never forget the wondrous stillness which brooded\r\nover earth and water, as we weighed anchor in the lee of my old\r\nfriend,--or old enemy,--the ruined fort. The deep, translucent water\r\nreposed at the base of the warm sunlit cliff like a great basin of\r\nglass, which I half expected to hear shiver and crack as our keel\r\nploughed through it. And how color and sound stood out in the\r\ntransparent air! How audibly the little ripples on the beach whispered\r\nto the open sky! How our irreverent voices seemed to jar upon the\r\nprivacy of the little cove! The mossy rocks doubled themselves without a\r\nflaw in the clear, dark water. The gleaming white beach lay fringed with\r\nits deep deposits of odorous sea-weed, gleaming black. The steep,\r\nstraggling sides of the cliffs raised aloft their rugged angles against\r\nthe burning blue of the sky. I remember, when Miss Blunt stepped ashore\r\nand stood upon the beach, relieved against the heavy shadow of a recess\r\nin the cliff, while her father and I busied ourselves with gathering up\r\nour baskets and fastening the anchor--I remember, I say, what a figure\r\nshe made. There is a certain purity in this Cragthorpe air which I have\r\nnever seen approached,--a lightness, a brilliancy, a _crudity_, which\r\nallows perfect liberty of self-assertion to each individual object in\r\nthe landscape. The prospect is ever more or less like a picture which\r\nlacks its final process, its reduction to unity. Miss Blunt's figure, as\r\nshe stood there on the beach, was almost _criarde_; but how lovely it\r\nwas! Her light muslin dress, gathered up over her short white skirt, her\r\nlittle black mantilla, the blue veil which she had knotted about her\r\nneck, the crimson shawl which she had thrown over her arm, the little\r\nsilken dome which she poised over her head in one gloved hand, while the\r\nother retained her crisp draperies, and which cast down upon her face a\r\nsharp circle of shade, out of which her cheerful eyes shone darkly and\r\nher happy mouth smiled whitely,--these are some of the hastily noted\r\npoints of the picture.\r\n\r\n\"Young woman,\" I cried out, over the water, \"I do wish you might know\r\nhow pretty you look!\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know I don't?\" she answered. \"I should think I might. You\r\ndon't look so badly, yourself. But it's not I; it's the accessories.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hang it! I am going to become profane,\" I called out again.\r\n\r\n\"Swear ahead,\" said the Captain.\r\n\r\n\"I am going to say you are devilish pretty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear me! is that all?\" cried Miss Blunt, with a little light laugh,\r\nwhich must have made the tutelar sirens of the cove ready to die with\r\njealousy down in their submarine bowers.\r\n\r\nBy the time the Captain and I had landed our effects, our companion had\r\ntripped lightly up the forehead of the cliff--in one place it is very\r\nretreating--and disappeared over its crown. She soon reappeared with an\r\nintensely white handkerchief added to her other provocations, which she\r\nwaved to us, as we trudged upward, carrying our baskets. When we stopped\r\nto take breath on the summit, and wipe our foreheads, we of course\r\nrebuked her who was roaming about idly with her parasol and gloves.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think I am going to take any trouble or do any work?\" cried Miss\r\nEsther, in the greatest good-humor. \"Is not this my holiday? I am not\r\ngoing to raise a finger, nor soil these beautiful gloves, for which I\r\npaid a dollar at Mr. Dawson's in Cragthorpe. After you have found a\r\nshady place for your provisions, I would like you to look for a spring.\r\nI am very thirsty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Find the spring yourself, Miss,\" said her father. \"Mr. Locksley and I\r\nhave a spring in this basket. Take a pull, Sir.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the Captain drew forth a stout black bottle.\r\n\r\n\"Give me a cup, and I will look for some water,\" said Miss Blunt \"Only\r\nI'm so afraid of the snakes! If you hear a scream, you may know it's a\r\nsnake.\"\r\n\r\n\"Screaming snakes!\" said I; \"that's a new species.\"\r\n\r\nWhat nonsense it all sounds like now! As we looked about us, shade\r\nseemed scarce, as it generally is, in this region. But Miss Blunt, like\r\nthe very adroit and practical young person she is, for all that she\r\nwould have me believe the contrary, soon discovered a capital cool\r\nspring in the shelter of a pleasant little dell, beneath a clump of\r\nfirs. Hither, as one of the young gentlemen who imitate Tennyson would\r\nsay, we brought our basket, Blunt and I; while Esther dipped the cup,\r\nand held it dripping to our thirsty lips, and laid the cloth, and on the\r\ngrass disposed the platters round. I should have to be a poet, indeed,\r\nto describe half the happiness and the silly poetry and purity and\r\nbeauty of this bright long summer's day. We ate, drank, and talked; we\r\nate occasionally with our fingers, we drank out of the necks of our\r\nbottles, and we talked with our mouths full, as befits (and excuses)\r\nthose who talk wild nonsense. We told stories without the least point.\r\nBlunt and I made atrocious puns. I believe, indeed, that Miss Blunt\r\nherself made one little punkin, as I called it. If there had been any\r\nsuperfluous representative of humanity present, to register the fact, I\r\nshould say that we made fools of ourselves. But as there was no fool on\r\nhand, I need say nothing about it. I am conscious myself of having said\r\nseveral witty things, which Miss Blunt understood: _in vino veritas_.\r\nThe dear old Captain twanged the long bow indefatigably. The bright high\r\nsun lingered above us the livelong day, and drowned the prospect with\r\nlight and warmth. One of these days I mean to paint a picture which in\r\nfuture ages, when my dear native land shall boast a national school of\r\nart, will hang in the _Salon Carre_ of the great central museum,\r\n(located, let us say, in Chicago,) and remind folks--or rather make them\r\nforget--Giorgione, Bordone, and Veronese; A Rural Festival; three\r\npersons feasting under some trees; scene, nowhere in particular; time\r\nand hour, problematical. Female figure, a big _brune_; young man\r\nreclining on his elbow; old man drinking. An empty sky, with no end of\r\nexpression. The whole stupendous in color, drawing, feeling. Artist\r\nuncertain; supposed to be Robinson, 1900. That's about the programme.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner the Captain began to look out across the bay, and, noticing\r\nthe uprising of a little breeze, expressed a wish to cruise about for an\r\nhour or two. He proposed to us to walk along the shore to a point a\r\ncouple of miles northward, and there meet the boat. His daughter having\r\nagreed to this proposition, he set off with the lightened pannier, and\r\nin less than half an hour we saw him standing out from shore. Miss Blunt\r\nand I did not begin our walk for a long, long time. We sat and talked\r\nbeneath the trees. At our feet, a wide cleft in the hills--almost a\r\nglen--stretched down to the silent beach. Beyond lay the familiar\r\nocean-line. But, as many philosophers have observed, there is an end to\r\nall things. At last we got up. Miss Blunt said, that, as the air was\r\nfreshening, she believed she would put on her shawl. I helped her to\r\nfold it into the proper shape, and then I placed it on her shoulders,\r\nher crimson shawl over her black silk sack. And then she tied her veil\r\nonce more about her neck, and gave me her hat to hold, while she\r\neffected a partial redistribution of her hair-pins. By way of being\r\nhumorous, I placed her hat on my own head; at which she was kind enough\r\nto smile, as with downcast face and uplifted elbows she fumbled among\r\nher braids. And then she shook out the creases of her dress, and drew on\r\nher gloves; and finally she said, \"Well!\"--that inevitable tribute to\r\ntime and morality which follows upon even the mildest forms of\r\ndissipation. Very slowly it was that we wandered down the little glen.\r\nSlowly, too, we followed the course of the narrow and sinuous beach, as\r\nit keeps to the foot of the low cliffs. We encountered no sign of human\r\nlife. Our conversation I need hardly repeat. I think I may trust it to\r\nthe keeping of my memory: I think I shall be likely to remember it. It\r\nwas all very sober and sensible,--such talk as it is both easy and\r\npleasant to remember; it was even prosaic,--or, at least, if there was a\r\nvein of poetry in it, I should have defied a listener to put his finger\r\non it. There was no exaltation of feeling or utterance on either side;\r\non one side, indeed, there was very little utterance. Am I wrong in\r\nconjecturing, however, that there was considerable feeling of a certain\r\nquiet kind? Miss Blunt maintained a rich, golden silence. I, on the\r\nother hand, was very voluble. What a sweet, womanly listener she is!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_September 1st._--I have been working steadily for a week. This is the\r\nfirst day of autumn. Read aloud to Miss Blunt a little Wordsworth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_September 10th. Midnight._--Worked without interruption,--until\r\nyesterday, inclusive, that is. But with the day now closing--or\r\nopening--begins a new era. My poor vapid old diary, at last you shall\r\nhold a _fact_.\r\n\r\nFor three days past we have been having damp, chilly weather. Dusk has\r\nfallen early. This evening, after tea, the Captain went into town,--on\r\nbusiness, as he said: I believe, to attend some Poorhouse or Hospital\r\nBoard. Esther and I went into the parlor. The room seemed cold. She\r\nbrought in lamp from the dining-room, and proposed we should have a\r\nlittle fire. I went into the kitchen, procured an armful of wood, and\r\nwhile she drew the curtains and wheeled up the table, I kindled a\r\nlively, crackling blaze. A fortnight ago she would not have allowed me\r\nto do this without a protest. She would not have offered to do it\r\nherself,--not she!--but she would have said that I was not here to\r\nserve, but to be served, and would have pretended to call Dorothy. Of\r\ncourse I should have had my own way. But we have changed all that.\r\nEsther went to her piano, and I sat down to a book. I read not a word. I\r\nsat looking at my mistress, and thinking with a very uneasy heart. For\r\nthe first time in our friendship, she had put on a dark, warm dress: I\r\nthink it was of the material called alpaca. The first time I saw her\r\nshe wore a white dress with a purple neck-ribbon; now she wore a black\r\ndress with the same ribbon. That is, I remember wondering, as I sat\r\nthere eying her, whether it _was_ the same ribbon, or merely another\r\nlike it. My heart was in my throat; and yet I thought of a number of\r\ntrivialities of the same kind. At last I spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Blunt,\" I said, \"do you remember the first evening I passed\r\nbeneath your roof, last June?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly,\" she replied, without stopping.\r\n\r\n\"You played this same piece.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; I played it very badly, too. I only half knew it. But it is a\r\nshowy piece, and I wished to produce an effect. I didn't know then how\r\nindifferent you are to music.\"\r\n\r\n\"I paid no particular attention to the piece. I was intent upon the\r\nperformer.\"\r\n\r\n\"So the performer supposed.\"\r\n\r\n\"What reason had you to suppose so?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure I don't know. Did you ever know a woman to be able to give a\r\nreason, when she has guessed aright?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think they generally contrive to make up a reason, afterwards. Come,\r\nwhat was yours?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you _stared_ so hard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fie! I don't believe it. That's unkind.\"\r\n\r\n\"You said you wished me to invent a reason. If I really had one, I don't\r\nremember it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You told me you remembered the occasion in question perfectly.\"\r\n\r\n\"I meant the circumstances. I remember what we had for tea; I remember\r\nwhat dress I wore. But I don't remember my feelings. They were naturally\r\nnot very memorable.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you say, when your father proposed my coming?\"\r\n\r\n\"I asked how much you would be willing to pay?\"\r\n\r\n\"And then?\"\r\n\r\n\"And then, if you looked 'respectable'.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then?\"\r\n\r\n\"That was all. I told father to do as he pleased.\"\r\n\r\nShe continued to play. Leaning back in my chair, I continued to look at\r\nher. There was a considerable pause.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Esther,\" said I, at last.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me for interrupting you so often. But,\"--and I got up and went\r\nto the piano,--\"but I thank Heaven that it has brought you and me\r\ntogether.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked up at me and bowed her head with a little smile, as her hands\r\nstill wandered over the keys.\r\n\r\n\"Heaven has certainly been very good to us,\" said she.\r\n\r\n\"How much longer are you going to play?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure I don't know. As long as you like.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you want to do as I like, you will stop immediately.\"\r\n\r\nShe let her hands rest on the keys a moment, and gave me a rapid,\r\nquestioning look. Whether she found a sufficient answer in my face I\r\nknow not; but she slowly rose, and, with a very pretty affectation of\r\nobedience, began to close the instrument. I helped her to do so.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you would like to be quite alone,\" she said. \"I suppose your\r\nown room is too cold.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I answered, \"you've hit it exactly. I wish to be alone. I wish to\r\nmonopolize this cheerful blaze. Hadn't you better go into the kitchen\r\nand sit with the cook? It takes you women to make such cruel speeches.\"\r\n\r\n\"When we women are cruel, Mr. Locksley, it is without knowing it. We are\r\nnot wilfully so. When we learn that we have been unkind, we very humbly\r\nask pardon, without even knowing what our crime has been.\" And she made\r\nme a very low curtsy.\r\n\r\n\"I will tell you what your crime has been,\" said I. \"Come and sit by the\r\nfire. It's rather a long story.\"\r\n\r\n\"A long story? Then let me get my work.\"\r\n\r\n\"Confound your work! Excuse me, but I mean it. I want you to listen to\r\nme. Believe me, you will need all your thoughts.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at me steadily a moment, and I returned her glance. During\r\nthat moment I was reflecting whether I might silently emphasize my\r\nrequest by laying a lover's hand upon her shoulder. I decided that I\r\nmight not. She walked over and quietly seated herself in a low chair by\r\nthe fire. Here she patiently folded her arms. I sat down before her.\r\n\r\n\"With you, Miss Blunt,\" said I, \"one must be very explicit. You are not\r\nin the habit of taking things for granted. You have a great deal of\r\nimagination, but you rarely exercise it on the behalf of other people.\"\r\nI stopped a moment.\r\n\r\n\"Is that my crime?\" asked my companion.\r\n\r\n\"It's not so much a crime as a vice,\" said I; \"and perhaps not so much a\r\nvice as a virtue. Your crime is, that you are so stone-cold to a poor\r\ndevil who loves you.\"\r\n\r\nShe burst into a rather shrill laugh. I wonder whether she thought I\r\nmeant Johnson.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you speaking for, Mr. Locksley?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Are there so many? For myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Honestly?\"\r\n\r\n\"Honestly doesn't begin to express it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is that French phrase that you are forever using? I think I may\r\nsay, '_Allons, donc!_'\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us speak plain English, Miss Blunt.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Stone-cold' is certainly very plain English. I don't see the relative\r\nimportance of the two branches of your proposition. Which is the\r\nprincipal, and which the subordinate clause,--that I am stone-cold, as\r\nyou call it, or that you love me, as you call it?\"\r\n\r\n\"As I call it? What would you have me call it? For God's sake, Miss\r\nBlunt, be serious, or I shall call it something else. Yes, I love you.\r\nDon't you believe it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am open to conviction.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank God!\" said I.\r\n\r\nAnd I attempted to take her hand.\r\n\r\n\"No, no, Mr. Locksley,\" said she,--\"not just yet, if you please.\"\r\n\r\n\"Action speaks louder than words,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"There is no need of speaking loud. I hear you perfectly.\"\r\n\r\n\"I certainly sha'n't whisper,\" said I; \"although it is the custom, I\r\nbelieve, for lovers to do so. Will you be my wife?\"\r\n\r\n\"I sha'n't whisper, either, Mr. Locksley. Yes, I will.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now she put out her hand.--That's my fact.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_September 12th._--We are to be married within three weeks.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_September 19th._--I have been in New York a week, transacting business.\r\nI got back yesterday. I find every one here talking about our\r\nengagement. Esther tells me that it was talked about a month ago, and\r\nthat there is a very general feeling of disappointment that I am not\r\nrich.\r\n\r\n\"Really, if you don't mind it,\" said I, \"I don't see why others should.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know whether you are rich or not,\" says Esther; \"but I know\r\nthat I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed! I was not aware that you had a private fortune,\" etc., etc.\r\n\r\nThis little farce is repeated in some shape every day. I am very idle. I\r\nsmoke a great deal, and lounge about all day, with my hands in my\r\npockets. I am free from that ineffable weariness of ceaseless _giving_\r\nwhich I experienced six months ago. I was shorn of my hereditary\r\ntrinkets at that period; and I have resolved that _this_ engagement, at\r\nall events, shall have no connection with the shops. I was balked of my\r\npoetry once; I sha'n't be a second time. I don't think there is much\r\ndanger of this. Esther deals it out with full hands. She takes a very\r\npretty interest in her simple outfit,--showing me triumphantly certain\r\nof her purchases, and making a great mystery about others, which she is\r\npleased to denominate tablecloths and napkins. Last evening I found her\r\nsewing buttons on a tablecloth. I had heard a great deal of a certain\r\ngray silk dress; and this morning, accordingly, she marched up to me,\r\narrayed in this garment. It is trimmed with velvet, and hath flounces, a\r\ntrain, and all the modern improvements generally.\r\n\r\n\"There is only one objection to it,\" said Esther, parading before the\r\nglass in my painting-room: \"I am afraid it is above our station.\"\r\n\r\n\"By Jove! I'll paint your portrait in it,\" said I, \"and make our\r\nfortune. All the other men who have handsome wives will bring them to be\r\npainted.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean all the women who have handsome dresses,\" said Esther, with\r\ngreat humility.\r\n\r\nOur wedding is fixed for next Thursday. I tell Esther that it will be as\r\nlittle of a wedding, and as much of a marriage, as possible. Her father\r\nand her good friend the schoolmistress alone are to be present.--My\r\nsecret oppresses me considerably; but I have resolved to keep it for the\r\nhoneymoon, when it may take care of itself. I am harassed with a dismal\r\napprehension, that, if Esther were to discover it now, the whole thing\r\nwould be _a refaire_. I have taken rooms at a romantic little\r\nwatering-place called Clifton, ten miles off. The hotel is already quite\r\nfree of city-people, and we shall be almost alone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_September 28th._--We have been here two days. The little transaction in\r\nthe church went off smoothly. I am truly sorry for the Captain. We drove\r\ndirectly over here, and reached the place at dusk. It was a raw, black\r\nday. We have a couple of good rooms, close to the savage sea. I am\r\nnevertheless afraid I have made a mistake. It would perhaps have been\r\nwiser to go inland. These things are not immaterial: we make our own\r\nheaven, but we scarcely make our own earth. I am writing at a little\r\ntable by the window, looking out on the rocks, the gathering dusk, and\r\nthe rising fog. My wife has wandered down to the rocky platform in front\r\nof the house. I can see her from here, bareheaded, in that old crimson\r\nshawl, talking to one of the landlord's little boys. She has just given\r\nthe little fellow a kiss, bless her heart! I remember her telling me\r\nonce that she was very fond of little boys; and, indeed, I have noticed\r\nthat they are seldom too dirty for her to take on her knee. I have been\r\nreading over these pages for the first time in--I don't know when. They\r\nare filled with _her_,--even more in thought than in word. I believe I\r\nwill show them to her, when she comes in, I will give her the book to\r\nread, and sit by her, watching her face,--watching the great secret dawn\r\nupon her.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Later._--Somehow or other, I can write this quietly enough; but I\r\nhardly think I shall ever, write any more. When Esther came in, I handed\r\nher this book.\r\n\r\n\"I want you to read it,\" said I.\r\n\r\nShe turned very pale, and laid it on the table, shaking her head.\r\n\r\n\"I know it,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"What do you know?\"\r\n\r\n\"That you have a hundred thousand a year. But believe me, Mr. Locksley,\r\nI am none the worse for the knowledge. You intimated in one place in\r\nyour book that I am born for wealth and splendor. I believe I am. You\r\npretend to hate your money; but you would not have had me without it. If\r\nyou really love me,--and I think you do,--you will not let this make any\r\ndifference. I am not such a fool as to attempt to talk here about my\r\nsensations. But I remember what I said.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you expect me to do?\" I asked. \"Shall I call you some horrible\r\nname and cast you off?\"\r\n\r\n\"I expect you to show the same courage that I am showing. I never said I\r\nloved you. I never deceived you in that. I said I would be your wife. So\r\nI will, faithfully. I haven't so much heart as you think; and yet, too,\r\nI have a great deal more. I am incapable of more than one\r\ndeception.--Mercy! didn't you see it? didn't you know it? see that I saw\r\nit? know that I knew it? It was diamond cut diamond. You deceived me; I\r\ndeceived you. Now that your deception ceases, mine ceases. _Now_ we are\r\nfree, with our hundred thousand a year! Excuse me, but it sometimes\r\ncomes across me! _Now_ we can be good and honest and true. It was all a\r\nmake-believe virtue before.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you read that thing?\" I asked: actually--strange as it may seem--for\r\nsomething to say.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, while you were ill. It was lying with your pen in it, on the\r\ntable. I read it because I suspected. Otherwise I shouldn't have done\r\nso.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was the act of a false woman,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"A false woman? No,--simply of a woman. I am a woman, Sir.\" And she\r\nbegan to smile. \"Come, _you_ be a man!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRIVIERA DI PONENTE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            1.\r\n\r\n    On this lovely Western Shore, where no tempests rage and roar,\r\n    Over olive-bearing mountains, by the deep and violet sea,\r\n    There, through each long happy day, winding slowly on our way,\r\n    Travellers from across the ocean, toward Italia journeyed we,--\r\n          Each long day, that, richer, fairer,\r\n          Showed the charming Riviera.\r\n\r\n                           2.\r\n\r\n    There black war-ships doze at anchor, in the Bay of Villa-Franca;\r\n    Eagle-like, gray Esa, clinging to its rocky perch, looks down;\r\n    And upon the mountain dim, ruined, shattered, stern, and grim,\r\n    Turbia sees us through the ages with its austere Roman frown,--\r\n          While we climb, where cooler, rarer\r\n          Breezes sweep the Riviera.\r\n\r\n                          3.\r\n\r\n    Down the hillside steep and stony, through the old streets of Mentone,\r\n    Quiet, half-forgotten city of a drowsy prince and time,\r\n    Through the mild Italian midnight, rolls upon the wave the moonlight,\r\n    Murmuring in our dreams the cadence of a strange Ligurian rhyme,--\r\n          Rhymes in which each heart is sharer,\r\n          Journeying on the Riviera.\r\n\r\n                          4.\r\n\r\n    When the morning air comes purer, creeping up in our vettura,\r\n    Eastward gleams a rosy tumult with the rising of the day;\r\n    Toward the north, with gradual changes, steal along the mountain-ranges\r\n    Tender tints of warmer feeling, kissing all their peaks of gray;\r\n          And far south the waters wear a\r\n          Smile along the Riviera.\r\n\r\n                          5.\r\n\r\n    Helmed with snow, the Alpine giants at invaders look defiance,\r\n    Gazing over nearer summits, with a fixed, mysterious stare,\r\n    Down along the shaded ocean, on whose edge in tremulous motion\r\n    Floats an island, half-transparent, woven out of sea and air;--\r\n          For such visions, shaped of air, are\r\n          Frequent on our Riviera.\r\n\r\n                          6.\r\n\r\n    He whose mighty earthquake-tread all Europa shook with dread,\r\n    Chief whose infancy was cradled in that old Tyrrhenic isle,\r\n    Joins the shades of trampling legions, bringing from remotest regions\r\n    Gallic fire and Roman valor, Cimbric daring, Moorish guile,\r\n          Guests from every age to share a\r\n          Portion of this Riviera.\r\n\r\n                          7.\r\n\r\n    Then the Afric brain, whose story fills the centuries with its glory,\r\n    Moulding Gaul and Carthaginian into one all-conquering band,\r\n    With his tusked monsters grumbling, 'mid the alien snow-drifts\r\n        stumbling,\r\n    Then, an avalanche of ruin, thundering from that frozen land\r\n          Into vales their sons declare are\r\n          Sunny as our Riviera.\r\n\r\n                          8.\r\n\r\n    Tired of these, the mighty mother sought among her types another\r\n    Stamp of blended saint and hero, only once on earth before,--\r\n    In the luminous aureole shining from a maiden's soul\r\n    Through four hundred sluggish years; till again on Nizza's shore\r\n          Comes the hero of Caprera\r\n          Born upon our Riviera.\r\n\r\n                          9.\r\n\r\n    Thus forever, in our musing, comes man's spirit interfusing\r\n    Thought of poet and of hero with the landscape and the sky;\r\n    And this shore, no longer lonely, lives the life of romance only:\r\n    Gauls and Moors and Northern Sea-Kings, all are gliding,\r\n        ghost-like, by.\r\n          So with Nature man is sharer\r\n          Even on the Riviera.\r\n\r\n                         10.\r\n\r\n    Feeble voice! no longer stammer words which shame the panorama\r\n    Seen from all the mountain-passes of this old Aurelian Way,\r\n    With the shore below us sleeping, and the distant steamer creeping\r\n    From Marseilles to proud Genova, on to Spezzia's famous bay.\r\n          So forever, _mia cara_,\r\n          Shall we love this Riviera.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDOCTOR JOHNS.\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVI.\r\n\r\nIt would have been strange, if Adele had not some day formed her ideal\r\nof a lover. What young girl, indeed, does not? Who cannot recall the\r\nsweet illusions of those tripping youthful years, when, for the first\r\ntime, Sir William Wallace strode so gallantly with waving plume and\r\nglittering falchion down the pages of Miss Porter,--when sweet Helen Mar\r\nwasted herself in love for the hero,--when the sun-browned Ivanhoe\r\ndashed so grandly into that famous tilting-ground near to\r\nAshby-de-la-Zouch, and brought the wicked Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert to\r\na reckoning,--when we wished the disinherited knight better things than\r\nthe cold love of the passionless Rowena, and sighed over the fate of\r\npoor Fergus MacIvor? With all these characters, and many other such,\r\nAdele had made acquaintance, in company with her dear Rose; and by the\r\nlight of them, they had fashioned such ideals in their little heads as\r\ndo not often appear in the flesh. Not that the two friends always agreed\r\nin their dreamy fancies; but for either, a hero must have been handsome\r\nand brave and true and kind and sagacious and learned. If only a few\r\nhundred of men should be patterned after the design of a young girl of\r\nsixteen or eighteen, what an absurd figure we old sinners should cut in\r\nthe comparison! Yet it is pleasant to reflect that thousands of fresh\r\nyoung hearts do go on, year after year, conceiving of wonderful\r\nexcellences as pertaining to the baser sex; and the knowledge of the\r\nfact should, it would seem, give a little more of animation to our\r\nstruggles against the deviltries and brutalities of the world.\r\n\r\nBut the ideal of our friend Adele had not been constant. Three years\r\nback, the open, frank, brave front which Phil Elderkin wore had almost\r\nreached it; and when Rose had said,--as she was wont to say, in her\r\nsisterly pride,--\"He's a noble fellow,\" there had been a little tingling\r\nof the heart in Adele, which seemed to echo the words. Afterward had\r\ncome that little glimpse of the world which her journey and intercourse\r\nwith Maverick had afforded; and the country awkwardness of the Elderkins\r\nhad somehow worked an eclipse of his virtues. Reuben, indeed, had\r\ncomeliness, and had caught at that time some of the graces of the city;\r\nbut Reuben was a _tease_, and failed in a certain quality of respect for\r\nher, (at least, she fancied it,) in default of which she met all his\r\nfavors with a sisterly tenderness, in which there was none of the\r\nreserve that tempts passion to declare itself.\r\n\r\nLater, when Reuben so opened the way to her belief, and associated\r\nhimself so intimately with the culmination of her religious faith, he\r\nseemed to her for a time the very impersonation of her girlish\r\nfancy,--so tender, so true, so trustful. Her religious enthusiasm\r\nblended with and warmed her sentiment; and never had she known such\r\nhours of calm enjoyment, or such hopeful forecast of her worldly future,\r\nas in those golden days when the hearts of both were glowing (or seemed\r\nto be) with a common love. It was not that this sentiment in her took\r\nany open form of expression; her instinctive delicacy so kept it under\r\ncontrol that she was but half conscious of its existence. But it was\r\nnone the less true that the sad young pilgrim, who had been a brother,\r\nand who had unlocked for her the Beautiful Gate, wore a new aspect. Her\r\nheart was full of those glittering estimates of life, which come at rare\r\nintervals, in which duties and affections all seem in delightful accord,\r\nworking each their task, and glowing through all the reach of years,\r\nuntil the glow is absorbed in the greater light which shines upon\r\nChristian graves. But Reuben's desertion from the faith broke this\r\nphantasm. Her faith, standing higher, never shook; but the sentiment\r\nwhich grew under its cover found nothing positive whereby to cling, and\r\nperished with the shock. Besides which, her father's injunction came to\r\nthe support of her religious convictions, and made her disposition to\r\nshake off that empty fancy tenfold strong. Had Reuben, in those days of\r\nhis exaltation, made declaration of his attachment, it would have met\r\nwith a response that could have admitted of no withdrawal, and her heart\r\nwould have been leashed to his, whatever outlawry might threaten him.\r\nShe thanked Heaven that it had not been thus. Her ideal was still\r\nunstained and unbroken; but it no longer found its type in the\r\nbacksliding Reuben. It is doubtful, indeed, if her sentiment at this\r\nperiod, by mere force of rebound, and encouraged by her native charities\r\nand old proclivities, did not rally about young Elderkin, who had\r\nequipped himself with many accomplishments of the world, and who, if he\r\nmade no pretensions to the faith she had embraced, manifested an\r\nhabitual respect that challenged her gratitude.\r\n\r\nAs for Reuben, after his enthusiasm of the summer had vanished, he felt\r\na prodigious mortification in reflecting that Adele had been so closely\r\nthe witness of his short-lived hallucination. It humiliated him bitterly\r\nto think that all his religious zeal had proved in her regard but the\r\nempty crackling of a fire of thorns. No matter what may be a youth's\r\nsentiment for girlhood, he never likes it to be witness of anything\r\ndisparaging to his sturdy resolution and manly purpose. But Adele had\r\nseen him shake like a reed under the deepest emotions that could give\r\ntone to character; and in his mortification at the thought, he\r\ntransferred to her a share of the resentment he felt against himself. It\r\nwas a relief to treat her with a dignified coolness, and to meet all her\r\ntender inquiries, which she did not forbear, with an icy assurance of\r\nmanner that was more than half affected,--yet not unkind, but\r\nassiduously and intensely and provokingly civil.\r\n\r\nSeeing this, the Doctor and Miss Eliza had given over any fear of a\r\npossibly dangerous interest on the part of Reuben; and yet keen\r\nobservers might well have scented a danger in this very studied\r\nindifference, if they reflected that its motive lay exclusively in a\r\nmortified pride. We are not careful to conceal our mortifications from\r\nthose whose regard we rate humbly.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, it happened, that, with the coming of the autumn months,\r\nReuben, still floating drearily on a sea of religious speculation, and\r\nveering more and more into open mockery of the beliefs of all about him,\r\ngrew weary of his affectations with respect to Adele. He fretted under\r\nthe kindly manner with which she met his august civilities. They did not\r\nwound her sensibilities, as he hoped they might have done. Either this\r\ndisappointment or the need of relief provoked a change of tactics. With\r\na sudden zeal that was half earnest and half a freak of vanity, he\r\ndevoted himself to Adele. The father's sympathy with him was just now\r\ndead; that of the aunt had never been kindled to such a degree as to\r\nmeet his craving; with the Elderkins he was reluctant to unfold his\r\nopinions so far as to demand sympathy. As for Adele, if he could light\r\nup again the sentiment which he once saw beaming in her face, he could\r\nat least find in it a charming beguilement of his unrest. She had a\r\npassion for flowers: every day he gathered for her some floral gift;\r\nevery day she thanked him with a kindness that meant only kindness. She\r\nhad a passion for poetry: every day he read to her such as he knew she\r\nmust admire; every day she thanked him with a warmth upon which he could\r\nbuild no hopes.\r\n\r\nBoth the Doctor and Miss Eliza were disturbed by this new zeal of his.\r\nAt the instance of the spinster, the Doctor undertook to lay before\r\nReuben the information conveyed in the letter of Maverick, and that\r\ngentleman's disapproval of any association between the young people\r\nlooking to marriage. It was not an easy or an agreeable task for the\r\nDoctor; and he went about it in a very halting manner.\r\n\r\n\"Your Aunt Eliza has observed, Reuben, that you have lately become more\r\npointed in your attentions to Adaly.\"\r\n\r\n\"I dare say, father; worries her, doesn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"We do not know how far these attentions may be serious, Reuben.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor I, father.\"\r\n\r\nThe Doctor was shocked at this new evidence of his son's indifference to\r\nany fixed rule of conduct.\r\n\r\n\"How long is it, father,\" continued Reuben, \"since Aunt Eliza has\r\ncommenced her plottings against Adele?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not plottings against her, I trust, Reuben.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, she has, father. She's badgering her in her quiet way\r\nincessantly,--as far back as when she caught sight of her in that dance\r\nat the Elderkins'. For my part, I think it was a charming thing to see.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have graver reasons for our anxiety in regard to your relations with\r\nher, my son; and not the least of them is Mr. Maverick's entire\r\ndisapproval of any such attachment.\"\r\n\r\nAnd thereupon the Doctor had proceeded to lay before Reuben (who now\r\nshowed a most lively interest) a full revelation of the facts announced\r\nin Maverick's letter.\r\n\r\nThe son had a strong smack of the father's family pride, and the strange\r\nnews was bewildering to him; but in his present stage of distrust, he\r\nfelt a strong disposition to protest against all the respectable\r\nconventionalities that hedged him in. A generous instinct in him, too,\r\nas he thought of the poor girl under the ban of the townsfolk, craved\r\nsome chivalric expression; and whatever sentiment he may really have\r\nentertained for her in past days took new force in view of the sudden\r\nbarriers that rose between him and the tender, graceful, confiding,\r\ncharming Adele, whose image had so long and (as he now thought) so\r\nconstantly dwelt in the dreamy mirage of his future. Under the spur of\r\nthese feelings, he presently gave over his excited walk up and down the\r\nstudy, and, coming close to the Doctor, whispered, with a grave\r\nearnestness that made the old gentleman recognize a man in his boy,--\r\n\r\n\"Father, I have doubted my own feelings about Adele: now I do not. I\r\nlove her; I love her madly. I shall protect her; if she will marry me,\"\r\n(and he touched the Doctor on the shoulder with a quick, nervous tap of\r\nhis hand,) \"I shall marry her,--God bless her!\"\r\n\r\nAnd Reuben, by the very speech, as well as by the thoughts that had gone\r\nbefore, had worked himself into a passion of devotion.\r\n\r\n\"Be careful, my son,\" said the old gentleman; \"remember how your\r\nenthusiasm has betrayed you in a still more serious matter.\"\r\n\r\nReuben smiled bitterly.\r\n\r\n\"Don't reproach me with that, father. It seems to me that I am acting\r\nnow more on the side of the Christian charities than either you or Aunt\r\nEliza.\"\r\n\r\nAnd with this he strode out, leaving the Doctor in an agony of\r\napprehension.\r\n\r\nA moment after, Miss Eliza, who was ever on the alert, and without whose\r\nknowledge a swallow could not dart into the chimneys of the parsonage,\r\ncame rustling into the study.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Benjamin, what does Reuben say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Given over to his idols, Eliza,--given over to his idols. We can only\r\npray God to have him in His holy keeping.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to fathom all the emotions of Reuben during that\r\ninterview with his father. It would be wrong to say that the view of\r\nfuture marriage had not often held up its brilliant illusions before\r\nhim; it would be wrong to say that they had never been associated with\r\nthe charming vivacity of Adele, as well as, at other times, with the\r\nsweet graces of Rose Elderkin. But these illusions had been of a\r\ncharacter so transitory, so fleeting, that he had come to love their\r\nbrilliant changes, and to look forward with some dread to the possible\r\npermanence of them, or such fixedness as should take away the charming\r\ndrift of his vagaries. If, in some wanton and quite impossible moment,\r\nthe modest Rose had conquered her delicacy so far as to put her hand in\r\nhis, and say, \"Will you be my husband?\" he would not have been so much\r\noutraged by her boldness as disturbed by the reflection that a pleasant\r\nlittle dream of love was broken up, and that his thought must come to\r\nthat practical solution of a _yes_ or _no_ which would make an end of\r\nhis delightful doubts and yearnings. The positive and the known are,\r\nafter all, so much less, under imaginative measure, than the uncertain\r\nand the dreamy!\r\n\r\nAnd if he could have taken the spinster's old tales of Adele's regard\r\nfor him and devotion to him at their highest truth, (which he never did,\r\nbecause of the girl's provoking familiarity and indifference,) he would\r\nhave felt a great charm in his life cut off. Yet now he wanders in\r\nsearch of her with his heart upon his lip and a great fire in his brain.\r\nNot a little pride in affronting opinion may have kindled the glow of\r\nhis sudden resolve. There was an audacity in it that tempted and regaled\r\nhim. Why should he, whose beliefs were so uncertain, who had grown into\r\ndoubts of that faith on which all the conventional proprieties about him\r\nreposed,--why should he not discard them, and obey a single, strong,\r\ngenerous instinct? When a man's religious sensibilities suffer recoil as\r\nReuben's had done, there grows up a new pride in the natural emotions of\r\ngenerosity; the humane instincts show exceptional force; the skeptics\r\nbecome the teachers of an exaggerated philanthropy.\r\n\r\nDid he love her beyond all others? Yesterday he could not have told;\r\nto-day, under the fervor of his audacity and of his pride, his love\r\nblazes in a fiery flame. It seethes around the memory of her lithe,\r\ngraceful figure in a whirl of passion. Those ripe red lips shall taste\r\nthe burning heat of his love and tenderness. He will guard, cherish,\r\nprotect, and the iron aunt may protest, or the world talk as it will.\r\n\"Adele!\" \"Adele!\" His heart is full of the utterance, and his step wild\r\nwith tumultuous feeling, as he rushes away to find her,--to win her,--to\r\nbind together their destinies forever!\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVII.\r\n\r\nIt was a mellow evening of later October. Mists hung in all the hollows\r\nof the hills. Within the orchard, where Adele was strolling, a few\r\ngolden apples still shone among the bronzed leaves. She saw Reuben\r\ncoming swiftly through the garden; but his eager step faltered as he\r\ncame near her. Even the serene look of girlhood has a power in it to\r\nmake impassioned confidence waver, and enthusiasms suffer recoil. He\r\nmeets her at last with an assumption of his every-day manner, which she\r\ncannot but see presently is underlaid with a tempest of struggling\r\nfeeling to which he is a stranger. He has taken her hand and placed it\r\nin his arm,--a little coquettish device to which he was wont; but he\r\nkeeps the little hand in his with a nervous clasp that is new, and that\r\nmakes her tremble all the more when his speech grows impassioned, and\r\nthe easy compliments of his past days of frolicsome humor take a depth\r\nof tone which make her heart thrill strangely. Meantime, they had come\r\nto the garden-end of the walk.\r\n\r\n\"It's late, Reuben, and I must go indoors,\" said she, with a quiet that\r\nshe did not feel.\r\n\r\n\"We'll take one more turn, Adele; you _must_.\" And her hand trembled in\r\nthe eager clasp he fastened upon it.\r\n\r\nNot once did it come into her mind that Reuben was to make a declaration\r\nof passion for her. She had feared only some burst of feeling in the\r\ndirection of the spinster, or of the Doctor, which should compromise him\r\neven more seriously. When, therefore, he burst forth, as he did\r\npresently, with a passionate avowal of his love, she was overwhelmed\r\nwith confusion.\r\n\r\n\"This is so sudden, so strange, Reuben! indeed it is!\"\r\n\r\nTenderly as she may have felt toward him in days gone, and gratefully as\r\nshe always felt, this sudden attempt to carry by storm the very citadel\r\nof her affections was not alone a surprise, but seemed like sacrilege.\r\nThe mystery and doubt that overhung the relations between her own father\r\nand mother--and which she felt keenly--had made her regard with awe any\r\npossible marriage of her own, investing the thought of it with a\r\nterrible sanctity, and as something to be approached only with a\r\nreverent fear. If in this connection she had ever thought of Reuben, it\r\nwas in those days when he seemed so earnest in the faith, and when their\r\nfeelings were blent by some superhuman agency. But at his divergence\r\ninto the paths of skepticism, it seemed to her simple and intense faith\r\nthat thenceforth their pilgrimages must be wholly distinct: his--and she\r\ntrembled at the thought of it--through some terrible maze of error,\r\nwhere she could not follow: and hers--by God's grace--straight to the\r\ncity whose gates are of pearl.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, she had replied to the passionate address of Reuben,\r\n\"You must not talk thus,\" it was with a tear in her eye.\r\n\r\n\"It grieves you, then, Adele?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it grieves me, Reuben. Our paths are different now\"; and she\r\nbethought herself of her father's injunction, which seemed to make her\r\nduty still plainer, and forbade her to encourage that parley with her\r\nheart which--with her hand still fast in Reuben's, and his eyes beaming\r\nwith a fierce heat upon her--she was beginning to entertain.\r\n\r\n\"Adele, tell me, can I go on?\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, indeed, you must not, Reuben!\"--and withdrawing her hand\r\nsuddenly, she passed it over brow and eyes, as if to rally her thoughts\r\nto measure the situation.\r\n\r\n\"You are weeping, Adele?\" said Reuben.\r\n\r\n\"No, not weeping,\" said she, dashing the merest film of mist from her\r\neyes, \"but so troubled!--so troubled!\" And she looked yearningly, but\r\nvainly, in his face for that illumination which had belonged to his\r\nenthusiasm of the summer.\r\n\r\nThey walked for a moment in silence,--he, with a scowl upon his face.\r\nSeeing this, Adele said plaintively,--\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me, Reuben, as if this might be only a solemn mockery of\r\nyours.\"\r\n\r\n\"You doubt me, then?\" returned he like a flash.\r\n\r\n\"Do you not doubt yourself, Reuben? Have you never doubted yourself?\"\r\nThis with a glance that pierced him through.\r\n\r\n\"Good Heavens! are you turned preacher?\" said he, bitterly. \"Will you\r\nmeasure a heart by its dogmatic beliefs?\"\r\n\r\n\"For shame, Reuben!\"\r\n\r\nAnd for a time both were silent. At last Adele spoke again,--\r\n\r\n\"There is a sense of coming trouble that oppresses me strangely,--that\r\ntells me I must not listen to you, Reuben.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it, Adele; and it is for this I would cherish you, and protect\r\nyou against all possible shame or indignities\"----\r\n\r\n\"Shame! Indignities! What does this mean? What do you know, Reuben?\"\r\n\r\nReuben blushed scarlet. His speech had outrun his discretion; but\r\nseizing her hand, and pressing it more tenderly than ever, he said,--\r\n\r\n\"Only this, Adele: I see that a coolness has grown up toward you in the\r\nparsonage; the old prejudice against French blood may revive again;\r\nbesides which, there is, you know, Adele, that little family cloud\"----\r\n\r\n\"Is this the old, kind Reuben, my brother, who reminds me of a trouble\r\nso shadowy I cannot fairly measure it?\" And Adele covered her face with\r\nher hands.\r\n\r\n\"Forgive me, Adele, for God's sake!\"\r\n\r\n\"There _is_ a cloud, Reuben; thank you for the word,\" said Adele,\r\nrecovering herself; \"and there is, I fear, an even darker cloud upon\r\nyour faith. Until both are passed, I can never listen to such talk as\r\nyou would urge upon me,--never! never!\"\r\n\r\nAnd there was a spirit in her words now that awed Reuben.\r\n\r\n\"Would you impute my unbelief to me as a crime, Adele? Is this your\r\nChristian charity? Do you think that I enjoy this fierce wrestling with\r\ndoubts? or, having them, would you bid me play false and conceal them?\r\nWhat if I am a final castaway, as your good books tell us some must be,\r\nwould you make me a castaway before my time, and balk all my hopes in\r\nlife? Is this your charity?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would not,--you know I would not, Reuben.\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen to me, Adele. If there be any hope of making my way out of this\r\nweary wrangle, it seems to me that it would be in the constant presence\r\nof your simple, exultant faith. Will you be my teacher, Adele?\"\r\n\r\n\"Teacher,--yes, with all my heart, Reuben.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then be mine,\" said he, seizing her hand again, \"from this very hour!\"\r\n\r\nAn instant she seemed to waver; then came over her the memory of her\r\nfather's injunction,--the mystery, too, that overshadowed her own life.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot,--I cannot, Reuben!\"\r\n\r\n\"Is this final?\" said he, calmly.\r\n\r\n\"Final.\"\r\n\r\nShe sighed it rather than spoke aloud; the next instant she had slipped\r\naway through the shrubbery, with a swift, cruel rustle of her silken\r\ndress, toward the parsonage.\r\n\r\nReuben lingered in the orchard until he saw the light flashing through\r\nthe muslin hangings of her window. She had gone early to her chamber.\r\nShe had kissed the crucifix that was her mother's with a fervor that\r\nsprang as much from devotion as from sentiment. She had sobbed out her\r\nprayer, and with sobs had buried her sweet face in the pillow.\r\n\r\nCould Reuben have seen or conceived all this, he might have acted\r\ndifferently.\r\n\r\nAs it was, he entered the Doctor's study an hour later, with the utmost\r\napparent coolness.\r\n\r\n\"Well, father,\" said he, \"I have offered marriage to your motherless and\r\npious French _protegee_, and she declines.\"\r\n\r\n\"My poor son!\" said the Doctor.\r\n\r\nBut his sympathy was not so much with any possible feeling of\r\ndisappointment as with the chilling heartlessness and unbelief that\r\nseemed to boast themselves in his speech.\r\n\r\n\"It will be rather dull in Ashfield now, I fancy,\" continued Reuben,\r\n\"and I shall slip off to New York to-morrow and take a new taste of the\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the Doctor (as if to himself) said despairingly, \"'_Whom He will He\r\nhardeneth._'\"\r\n\r\n\"But father,\" said Reuben, (without notice of the old gentleman's\r\nejaculation,) \"don't let Aunt Eliza know of this,--not a word, or she\r\nwill be fearfully cruel to the poor child.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a grave household in the parsonage next morning. Reuben\r\nrebelled in heart, in face, and in action against the tediously long\r\nprayer of the parson, though the old gentleman's spirit was writhing\r\npainfully in his pleadings. The aunt was more pious and austere than\r\never. Adele, timid and shrinking, yet with a beautiful and a trustful\r\nillumination in her eye, that for days, and weeks, and months, lingered\r\nin the memory of the parson's son.\r\n\r\nLater in the day Reuben went to make his adieus to the Elderkins. The\r\nold Squire was seated in his door busied with the \"Weekly Courant,\"\r\nwhich had just come in.\r\n\r\n\"Aha, Master Reuben,\" (this was his old-fashioned way,) \"you're looking\r\nfor that lazy fellow, Phil, I suppose. You'll find him up-stairs with\r\nhis cigar and his Spanish, I'll venture.\"\r\n\r\nReuben made his way up to Phil's chamber after the unceremonious manner\r\nto which he has been used in that hospitable home, while a snatch of a\r\nlittle songlet from Rose came floating after him along the stairs. It\r\nwas very sweet. But what were sweet songlets to him now? It being a mild\r\nautumn day, Phil sat at the open window, from which he had many a time\r\nseen the old Doctor jogging past in his chaise, and sometimes the tall\r\nAlmira picking her maidenly way along the walk with her green parasol\r\ndaintily held aloft with thumb and two fingers, while from the lesser\r\nfingers dangled a little embroidered bag which was the wonder of all the\r\nschool-girls. Other times, too, from this eyrie of his, he had seen\r\nAdele tripping past, with Reuben beside her, and had wondered what their\r\nchat might be, while he had feasted his eyes upon her fair figure.\r\n\r\nYet Phil was by no means an idler; he had developed a great business\r\nshrewdness, and two or three times in the week drove over to a\r\nneighboring river-town to look after the shipments to the West Indies in\r\nwhich he was now interested in company with the Squire. But this had not\r\nforbidden a little cursory reading of a sentimental kind. There may have\r\nbeen a stray volume of Pelham upon his table, and a six-volume set of\r\nByron in green and gold upon his limited book-shelf, (both of which were\r\nstrongly disapproved of by Mrs. Elderkin, but tolerated by the\r\nSquire,)--besides which, there were certain Spanish ballads to which he\r\nhad taken a great fancy since his late visit to Cuba.\r\n\r\nReuben was always a welcome visitor, and was presently in full flow of\r\ntalk, and puffing nervously at one of Phil's choice Havanas (which in\r\nthat day were true to their titles).\r\n\r\n\"I'm off, Phil,\" said Reuben at last, breaking in upon his host's\r\necstasy over a ballad he had been reciting, with what he counted the\r\ntrue Castilian magniloquence.\r\n\r\n\"Off where?\" said Phil.\r\n\r\n\"Off for the city. I'm weary of this do-nothing life,--weary of the\r\ntown, weary of the good people.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's nothing you care for, then, in Ashfield?\" said Phil. And at\r\nthat moment a little burst of the singing of Rose came floating up the\r\nstair,--so sweet! so sweet!\r\n\r\n\"Care for? Yes,\" said Reuben, \"but they are all so good! so devilish\r\ngood!\"--and he puffed at his cigar with a nervous violence. It was not\r\noften that such an approach to profanity sullied the lips of Reuben, and\r\nPhil noted it with surprise.\r\n\r\n\"I thought there would have been at least one magnet that would have\r\nkept you here,\" said Phil.\r\n\r\n\"What magnet, pray?\" says Reuben,--somewhat calm again.\r\n\r\n\"There she goes,\" says Phil, looking out of the window. And at the\r\nmoment Adele tripped by, with the old Doctor walking gravely at her\r\nside.\r\n\r\n\"Humph!\" said Reuben, with a composure that was feigned, \"she's too much\r\nof a Puritan for me, Phil: or rather, I'm too little of a Puritan for\r\nher.\"\r\n\r\nPhilip looked at his companion keenly. And Reuben, looking back at him\r\nas keenly, said, after a silence of a few moments,--\r\n\r\n\"I don't think you'll ever marry her either, Phil.\"\r\n\r\n\"Marry!\" said Phil, with a deep, honest blush,--\"who talks of that?\"\r\n\r\n\"You, in your heart, Phil. Do you think I am blind? Do you think I have\r\nnot seen that you have loved her, Phil, ever since you knew what it was\r\nto love a woman? Do you think, that, as a boy, you ever imposed upon me\r\nwith your talk about that handsome Suke Boody, the tavern-keeper's\r\ndaughter? Good Heavens! Phil, I think there were never two men in the\r\nworld who talked their thoughts plainly to each other! Do you think I do\r\nnot know that you have played the shy lover, because with your big heart\r\nyou have yielded to what you counted a prior claim of mine,--because\r\nAdele was one of us at the parsonage?\"\r\n\r\n\"In such affairs,\" said Phil, with some constraint and not a little\r\nwounded pride, \"I don't think men are apt to recognize prior claims.\"\r\n\r\nReuben replied only by a faint sardonic smile.\r\n\r\n\"You're a good fellow, Phil, but you won't marry her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, then, you know why,\" said Phil, with something very like a\r\nsneer.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" said Reuben. \"Because you can't affront the world, because\r\nyou are bound by its conventionalities and respectabilities, as I am\r\nnot. I spurn them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Respectabilities!\" said Phil, in amazement. \"What does this mean? Just\r\nnow she was a Puritan.\"\r\n\r\n\"It means, Phil,\" (and here Reuben reflected a moment or two, puffing\r\nwith savage energy,) \"it means what I can't wholly explain to you. You\r\nknow her French blood; you know all the prejudices against the faith in\r\nwhich she was reared; you know she has an instinct and will of her own.\r\nIn short, Phil, I don't think you'll ever marry her; but if you can, you\r\nmay.\"\r\n\r\n\"_May!_\" said Phil, whose pride was now touched to the quick. \"And what\r\nauthority have you, pray?\"\r\n\r\n\"The authority of one who has loved her,\" said Reuben, with a fierce,\r\nquick tone, and dashing his half-burnt cigar from the window; \"the\r\nauthority of one who, if he had chosen to perjure himself and profess a\r\nfaith which he could not entertain, and wear sanctimonious airs, might\r\nhave won her heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe it!\" said Phil, with a great burst of voice. \"There's\r\nno hypocrisy could win Adele.\"\r\n\r\nReuben paced up and down the chamber, then came and took the hand of his\r\nold friend:--\r\n\r\n\"Phil, you're a noble-hearted fellow. I never thought any one could\r\nconvict me of injustice to Adele. You have done it. I hope you'll always\r\ndefend her; and whatever may betide, I hope your mother and Rose will\r\nalways befriend her. She may need it.\"\r\n\r\nAgain there was a little burst of song from below, and it lingered upon\r\nthe ear of Reuben long after he had left the Elderkin homestead.\r\n\r\nThe next day he was gone,--to try his new taste of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVIII.\r\n\r\nIt was in no way possible for the simple-hearted Doctor to conceal from\r\nthe astute spinster the particular circumstances which had hurried\r\nReuben's departure, and the knowledge of them made her humiliation\r\ncomplete. During all the latter months of Reuben's stay she had not\r\nscrupled to drop occasional praises of him into the ear of Adele, as in\r\nthe old times. It was in agreement with her rigid notions of\r\nretribution, that this poor social outlaw should love vainly; and a\r\nbaffling disappointment would have seemed to the spinster's narrow mind\r\na highly proper and most logical result of the terrible ignominy which\r\noverhung the unconscious victim. Indeed, the innocent unconsciousness of\r\nanything derogatory to her name or character which belonged to Adele,\r\nand her consequent cheery mirthfulness, were sources of infinite\r\nannoyance to Miss Eliza. She would have liked to see her in sackcloth\r\nfor a while, and to enjoy her own moral elevation by such a contrast.\r\nNor was this from sheer malice; in that sense she was not malicious; but\r\nshe deluded herself with the idea that this was a high religious view of\r\nsin and its consequences,--a proper mortification to befall one on whom\r\nHeaven's punishment (of the fathers through the children) must needs\r\ndescend. And like many another of her iron purpose, she would not have\r\nshrunk from being herself the instrument of such punishment, and would\r\nhave gloated over its accomplishment,--as if by it the Devil's devices\r\nhad received rebuke, and the elect found cause for comfort. Many good\r\npeople--as the world goes--have this vulture appetite for preying upon\r\nthe very bowels of sinners; and there is no judge so implacable as one\r\nwho inflames his judicial zeal with the fiery heats of an exaggerated\r\nreligious pretension.\r\n\r\nThink, then, of the situation of poor Adele under the attentions of such\r\na woman, after she has ferreted out from the Doctor the truth with\r\nrespect to Reuben! It makes us tremble while we write of it. There is\r\noften a kind of moral tyranny in households, which, without ever a loud\r\nword, much less a blow, can pierce a sensitive mind as with fiery\r\nneedles. Of such a silent, fearful tyranny Adele now felt the\r\ninnumerable stings, and under it her natural exuberance of spirits gave\r\nway, her faith almost waned; it seemed to her that a kiss upon her\r\nsilent crucifix were better than a prayer shared with her tormentor.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor showed all his old, grave kindness; but he was sadly broken\r\nby his anxieties with respect to his son; nor was he ever demonstrative\r\nenough to supply the craving of Adele's heart, under her present greed\r\nfor sympathy. Even the villagers looked upon her more coldly since the\r\nsharpened speech of the spinster had dropped widely, but very quietly,\r\nits damaging innuendoes, and since her well-calculated surmises, that\r\nFrench blood was, after all, not to be wholly trusted. It was clear to\r\nthe townspeople that all was at an end between Adele and Reuben,--clear\r\nthat she had fallen away from the old favor in which she once stood at\r\nthe parsonage; and Miss Eliza, by her adroit hints, and without any\r\npalpable violation of truth, found means of associating these results\r\nwith certain suspicious circumstances which had come to light respecting\r\nthe poor girl's character,--circumstances for which she herself (Miss\r\nEliza was kind enough to say) was not altogether accountable, perhaps,\r\nbut yet sufficient to warrant a little reserve of confidence, and _of\r\ncourse_ putting an end to any thought of intimate alliance with \"the\r\nJohns family.\" She even whispered in her most insidious manner into the\r\near of old Mistress Tew,--who, being somewhat deaf, is the most\r\ninveterate village gossip,--that \"it was hard for the poor thing, when\r\nReuben left so suddenly.\"\r\n\r\nAdele writes in these times to her father, that he need put himself in\r\nno fear in regard to marriage. \"I have had an _eclaircissement_\" (she\r\nsays) \"with friend Reuben. His declaration of attachment (I think I may\r\ntell _you_ this, dear papa) was so wholly unexpected that I could not\r\ncount it real. He seemed actuated by some sudden controlling sympathy\r\n(as he often is) that I could not explain; and had it been otherwise,\r\nyour injunction, dear papa, and the fact that he has become a bitter\r\nskeptic in regard to our most holy religion, would have made me pause.\r\nHe dropped a hint, too, of the mystery attaching to my family, (not\r\nunkindly, for he is, after all, a dear, good-hearted fellow,) which\r\nkindled not a little indignation in me; and I told him--with some of the\r\npride, I think, I must have inherited from you, papa--that, until that\r\nmystery was cleared, I would marry neither him nor another. Was I not\r\nright?\r\n\r\n\"I want so much to be with you again, dear papa,--to tell you all I hope\r\nand fear,--to feel your kiss again! Miss Johns, whom I have tried hard\r\nto love, but cannot, is changed wofully in her manner toward me. I feel\r\nit is only my home now by sufferance,--not such a home as you would\r\nchoose for me, I am sure. The Doctor--good soul--is as kind as he knows\r\nhow to be, but I want--oh, how I want!--to leap into your arms, dear\r\npapa, and find home there. Why can I not? I am sure--over and over\r\nsure--that I could bring some sunlight into a home of yours, if you\r\nwould but let me. And when you come, as you say you mean to do soon, do\r\nnot put me off with such stories as you once told me, of 'a lean\r\nSavoyard in red wig and spectacles, and of a fat Frenchman with bristly\r\nmoustache' (you see I remember all); tell me I may come to be the\r\nmistress of your parlor and your _salon_, and I will keep all in such\r\norder, that, I am sure, you will not want me to leave you again; and you\r\nwill love me so much that I shall never want to leave you.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, indeed, it is very wearisome to me here. The village people\r\nseem all of them to have caught the coolness of Miss Johns, and look\r\naskance at me. Only the Elderkins show their old kindness, and it is\r\nunfailing. Do not, I pray, disturb yourself about any 'lost fortune' of\r\nwhich you wrote to the Doctor, but never--cruel papa!--a word to me. I\r\nam rich: I can't tell you how many dollars are in the Savings Bank for\r\nme,--and for you, if you wish them, I have so little occasion to spend\r\nanything. But I have committed the extravagance of placing a beautiful\r\ntablet over the grave of poor Madame Arles, and, much to the horror of\r\nthe good Doctor, insisted upon having a little cross inscribed upon its\r\nfront. You have never told me, dear papa, if you received the long\r\naccount I gave you of her sudden death, and how she died without ever\r\ntelling me anything of herself,--though I believe it was in her mind to\r\ndo so, at the last.\"\r\n\r\nNo, of a truth, such a letter had never been received by Maverick, and\r\nhe cursed the mails royally for it, since it might have prevented the\r\nneed of any such disclosure as he had made to his friend Johns. When the\r\npresent missive of Adele came to him, he was entering the brilliant Cafe\r\nde L'Orient at Marseilles, in company with his friend Papiol. The news\r\nstaggered him for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"Papiol!\" said he, \"_mon ami_, Julie is dead!\"\r\n\r\n\"_Parbleu!_ And among your Puritans, yonder? She must have made a\r\npiquant story of it all!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a word, Papiol! She has kept by her promise bravely.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Tant mieux_: it will give you good appetite, _mon ami_.\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment the better nature of Maverick had been roused, and he\r\nturned a look of loathing upon the complacent Frenchman seated by him\r\n(which fortunately the stolid Papiol did not comprehend). For a moment,\r\nhis thought ran back to a sunny hillside near to the old town of Arles,\r\nwhere lines of stunted, tawny olives crept down the fields,--where\r\nfig-trees showed their purple nodules of fruit,--where a bright-faced\r\nyoung peasant-girl, with a gay kerchief turbaned about her head with a\r\ncoquettish tie, lay basking in the sunshine. He heard once more the trip\r\nof her voice warbling a Provencal song, while the great ruin of the\r\nRoman _arene_ came once more to his vision, with its tufting shrubs and\r\nbattered arches rising grim and gaunt into the soft Southern sky; the\r\nchurch-bells of the town poured their sweet jangle on his ear again, the\r\nmurmur of distant voices came floating down the wind, and again the\r\npretty Provencal song fluttered on the balmy air; the coquettish turban\r\nwas in his eye, the plump, soft hand of the pretty Provencal girl in his\r\ngrasp, and her glossy locks touched his burning cheek. So much, at\r\nleast, that was Arcadian; and then (in his glowing memory still) the\r\nloves, the jealousies, the delusions, the concealments, the\r\nfaithlessness, the desertion, the parting! And now,--now the chief\r\nactress in this drama that had touched him so nearly lay buried in a New\r\nEngland grave, with his own Adele her solitary mourner!\r\n\r\n\"It was your friend the Doctor who gave the good woman absolution, I\r\nsuppose,\" said Papiol, tapping his snuff-box, and gathering a huge pinch\r\nbetween thumb and finger.\r\n\r\n\"Not even that comfort, I suspect,\" said Maverick.\r\n\r\n_\"Bah! pauvre femme!\"_\r\n\r\nAnd the philosopher titillated his nostril until he sneezed again and\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"And the Doctor,\" continued Papiol,--\"does he suspect nothing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing. He has counselled me to make what amends I may by\r\nmarrying--you know whom.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Pardieu!_ he is a good innocent, that old friend of yours!\"\r\n\r\n\"Better than you or I, Papiol.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Cela va sans dire, mon ami._ And _la petite_,--the little\r\nbright-eyes,--what of her?\"\r\n\r\n\"She is unsuspicious, but hints at a little cloud that overshadows her\r\ndomestic history, and tells her lover that it shall be cleared up before\r\nshe will marry him, or any other.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ta, ta! It's an inquisitive sex, Maverick! I could never quite\r\nunderstand how Julie should have learned that her little one was still\r\nalive, and been able to trace her as she did. I think the death was set\r\nforth in the Gazette,--eh, Maverick?\"\r\n\r\n\"It certainly was,\" said Maverick,--\"honestly, for the child's good.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha!--honestly,--_bon_! I beg pardon, _mom ami_.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Papiol took snuff again.\r\n\r\n\"Set forth in the Gazette, _en regle_, and came to Julie's knowledge,\r\nas I am sure; and she sailed for the East with her brother, who was a\r\nsmall trader in Smyrna, I believe,--poor woman! To tell truth, Papiol,\r\nhad she been alive, loving Adele as I do, I believe I should have been\r\ntempted to follow the parson's admonition, cost what it might.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then?\"\r\n\r\n\"And then I should give _petite_ an honest name to bear,--honest as I\r\ncould, at least; and would have lavished wealth upon her, as I mean to\r\ndo; and made the last half of my life better than the first.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excellent! most excellent! considering that the lady is dead, _pauvre\r\nfemme_! And now, my dear fellow, you might go over to your country and\r\nplay the good Puritan by marrying Mees Eliza,--_hein_?\"\r\n\r\nAnd he called out obstreperously,--\r\n\r\n\"_Garcon!_\"\r\n\r\n\"_Voici, Messieurs!_\"\r\n\r\n\"_Absinthe,--deux verres._\"\r\n\r\nAnd he drummed with his fat fingers upon the edge of the marble slab.\r\n\r\n\"_Mon Dieu!_\" said Maverick, with a sudden pallor on his face, \"who is\r\nshe?\"\r\n\r\nThe eyes of Papiol fastened upon the figure which had arrested the\r\nattention of Maverick,--a lady of, may-be, forty years, fashionably, but\r\ngracefully attired, with olive-brown complexion, hair still glossy\r\nblack, and attended by a strange gentleman with a brusque and foreign\r\nair.\r\n\r\n\"Who is she?\" says Maverick, in a great tremor. \"Do the dead come to\r\nhaunt us?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are facetious, my friend,\" said Papiol.\r\n\r\nBut in the next moment the lady opposite had raised her eyes, showing\r\nthat strange double look which had been so characteristic of Madame\r\nArles, and poor Papiol was himself fearfully distraught.\r\n\r\n\"It's true! It's true, _mon ami_!\" he whispered his friend. \"It's\r\nJulie!--_elle meme_,--Julie!\"\r\n\r\nMaverick, too, had met that glance, and he trembled like a leaf. He\r\ngazed upon the stranger like one who sees a spectre. And she met his\r\nglance, boldly at the first; then the light faded from her eyes, her\r\nhead drooped, and she fell in a swoon upon the shoulder of her\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHIMNEY-CORNER FOR 1866.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nTHE TRANSITION.\r\n\r\n\"The fact is, my dear,\" said my wife, \"that you have thrown a stone into\r\na congregation of blackbirds, in writing as you have of our family wars\r\nand wants. The response comes from all parts of the country, and the\r\ntask of looking over and answering your letters becomes increasingly\r\nformidable. Everybody has something to say,--something to propose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give me a _resume_,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said my wife, \"here are three pages from an elderly gentleman,\r\nto the effect that women are not what they used to be,--that daughters\r\nare a great care and no help,--that girls have no health and no energy\r\nin practical life,--that the expense of maintaining a household is so\r\ngreat that young men are afraid to marry,--and that it costs more now\r\nper annum to dress one young woman than it used to cost to carry a\r\nwhole family of sons through college. In short, the poor old gentleman\r\nis in a desperate state of mind, and is firmly of opinion that society\r\nis going to ruin by an express train.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor old fellow!\" said I, \"the only comfort I can offer him is what I\r\ntake myself,--that this sad world will last out our time at least. Now\r\nfor the next.\"\r\n\r\n\"The next is more concise and spicy,\" said my wife. \"I will read it.\r\n\r\n     \"'_Christopher Crowfield, Esq._,\r\n\r\n     \"'SIR,--If you want to know how American women are to be\r\n     brought back to family work, I can tell you a short method. Pay\r\n     them as good wages for it as they can make in any other way. I\r\n     get from seven to nine dollars a week in the shop where I work;\r\n     if I could make the same in any good family, I should have no\r\n     objection to doing it.\r\n\r\n    \"'Your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n    \"'LETITIA.'\"\r\n\r\n\"My correspondent Letitia does not tell me,\" said I, \"how much of this\r\nseven or nine dollars she pays out for board and washing, fire and\r\nlights. If she worked in a good family at two or three dollars a week,\r\nit is easily demonstrable, that, at the present cost of these items, she\r\nwould make as much clear profit as she now does at nine dollars for her\r\nshop-work.\r\n\r\n\"And there are two other things, moreover, which she does not consider:\r\nFirst, that, besides board, washing, fuel, and lights, which she would\r\nhave in a family, she would have also less unintermitted toil. Shop-work\r\nexacts its ten hours per diem; and it makes no allowance for sickness or\r\naccident.\r\n\r\n\"A good domestic in a good family finds many hours when she can feel\r\nfree to attend to her own affairs. Her work consists of certain definite\r\nmatters, which being done her time is her own; and if she have skill and\r\naddress in the management of her duties, she may secure many leisure\r\nhours. As houses are now built, and with the many labor-saving\r\nconveniences that are being introduced, the physical labor of housework\r\nis no more than a healthy woman really needs to keep her in health. In\r\ncase, however, of those slight illnesses to which all are more or less\r\nliable, and which, if neglected, often lead to graver ones, the\r\nadvantage is still on the side of domestic service. In the shop and\r\nfactory, every hour of unemployed time is deducted; an illness of a day\r\nor two is an appreciable loss of just so much money, while the expense\r\nof board is still going on. But in the family a good servant is always\r\nconsidered. When ill, she is carefully nursed as one of the family, has\r\nthe family physician, and is subject to no deduction from her wages for\r\nloss of time. I have known more than one instance in which a valued\r\ndomestic has been sent, at her employer's expense, to the seaside or\r\nsome other pleasant locality, for change of air, when her health has\r\nbeen run down.\r\n\r\n\"In the second place, family work is more remunerative, even at a lower\r\nrate of wages, than shop or factory work, because it is better for the\r\nhealth. All sorts of sedentary employment, pursued by numbers of persons\r\ntogether in one apartment, are more or less debilitating and unhealthy,\r\nthrough foul air and confinement.\r\n\r\n\"A woman's health is her capital. In certain ways of work she obtains\r\nmore income, but she spends on her capital to do it. In another way she\r\nmay get less income, and yet increase her capital. A woman cannot work\r\nat dress-making, tailoring, or any other sedentary employment, ten hours\r\na day, year in and out, without enfeebling her constitution, impairing\r\nher eyesight, and bringing on a complication of complaints, but she can\r\nsweep, wash, cook, and do the varied duties of a well-ordered house with\r\nmodern arrangements, and grow healthier every year. The times, in New\r\nEngland, when all women did housework a part of every day, were the\r\ntimes when all women were healthy. At present, the heritage of vigorous\r\nmuscles, firm nerves, strong backs, and cheerful physical life has gone\r\nfrom American women, and is taken up by Irish women. A thrifty young\r\nman, I have lately heard of, married a rosy young Irish girl, quite to\r\nthe horror of his mother and sisters, but defended himself by the\r\nfollowing very conclusive logic:--'If I marry an American girl, I must\r\nhave an Irish girl to take care of her; and I cannot afford to support\r\nboth.'\r\n\r\n\"Besides all this, there is a third consideration, which I humbly\r\ncommend to my friend Letitia. The turn of her note speaks her a girl of\r\ngood common sense, with a faculty of hitting the nail square on the\r\nhead; and such a girl must see that nothing is more likely to fall out\r\nthan that she will some day be married. Evidently, our fair friend is\r\nborn to rule; and at this hour, doubtless, her foreordained throne and\r\nhumble servant are somewhere awaiting her.\r\n\r\n\"Now domestic service is all the while fitting a girl physically,\r\nmentally, and morally for her ultimate vocation and sphere,--to be a\r\nhappy wife and to make a happy home. But factory work, shop work, and\r\nall employments of that sort, are in their nature essentially\r\n_undomestic_,--entailing the constant necessity of a boarding-house\r\nlife, and of habits as different as possible from the quiet routine of\r\nhome. The girl who is ten hours on the strain of continued,\r\nunintermitted toil feels no inclination, when evening comes, to sit down\r\nand darn her stockings, or make over her dresses, or study any of those\r\nmultifarious economies which turn a wardrobe to the best account. Her\r\nnervous system is flagging; she craves company and excitement; and her\r\ndull, narrow room is deserted for some place of amusement or gay street\r\npromenade. And who can blame her? Let any sensible woman, who has had\r\nexperience of shop and factory life, recall to her mind the ways and\r\nmanners in which young girls grow up who leave a father's roof for a\r\ncrowded boarding-house, without any supervision of matron or mother, and\r\nask whether this is the best school for training young American wives\r\nand mothers.\r\n\r\n\"Doubtless there are discreet and thoughtful women who, amid all these\r\ndifficulties, do keep up thrifty, womanly habits, but they do it by an\r\neffort greater than the majority of girls are willing to make, and\r\ngreater than they ought to make. To sew or read or study after ten hours\r\nof factory or shop work is a further drain on the nervous powers, which\r\nno woman can long endure without exhaustion.\r\n\r\n\"When the time arrives that such a girl comes to a house of her own, she\r\ncomes to it as unskilled in all household lore, with muscles as\r\nincapable of domestic labor, and nerves as sensitive, as if she had been\r\nleading the most luxurious, do-nothing, fashionable life. How different\r\nwould be her preparation, had the forming years of her life been spent\r\nin the labors of a family! I know at this moment a lady at the head of a\r\nrich country establishment, filling her station in society with dignity\r\nand honor, who gained her domestic education in a kitchen in our\r\nvicinity. She was the daughter of a small farmer, and when the time came\r\nfor her to be earning her living, her parents wisely thought it far\r\nbetter that she should gain it in a way which would at the same time\r\nestablish her health and fit her for her own future home. In a cheerful,\r\nlight, airy kitchen, which was kept so tidy always as to be an\r\nattractive sitting-room, she and another young country-girl were trained\r\nup in the best of domestic economies by a mistress who looked well to\r\nthe ways of her household, till at length they married from the house\r\nwith honor, and went to practise in homes of their own the lessons they\r\nhad learned in the home of another. Formerly, in New England, such\r\ninstances were not uncommon;--would that they might become so again!\"\r\n\r\n\"The fact is,\" said my wife, \"the places which the daughters of American\r\nfarmers used to occupy in our families are now taken by young girls from\r\nthe families of small farmers in Ireland. They are respectable, tidy,\r\nhealthy, and capable of being taught. A good mistress, who is reasonable\r\nand liberal in her treatment, is able to make them fixtures. They get\r\ngood wages, and have few expenses. They dress handsomely, have abundant\r\nleisure to take care of their clothes and turn their wardrobes to the\r\nbest account, and they very soon acquire skill in doing it equal to that\r\ndisplayed by any women of any country. They remit money continually to\r\nrelatives in Ireland, and from time to time pay the passage of one and\r\nanother to this country,--and whole families have thus been established\r\nin American life by the efforts of one young girl. Now, for my part, I\r\ndo not grudge my Irish fellow-citizens these advantages obtained by\r\nhonest labor and good conduct: they deserve all the good fortune thus\r\naccruing to them. But when I see sickly, nervous American women jostling\r\nand struggling in the few crowded avenues which are open to mere brain,\r\nI cannot help thinking how much better their lot would have been, with\r\ngood strong bodies, steady nerves, healthy digestion, and the habit of\r\nlooking any kind of work in the face, which used to be characteristic of\r\nAmerican women generally, and of Yankee women in particular.\"\r\n\r\n\"The matter becomes still graver,\" said I, \"by the laws of descent. The\r\nwoman who enfeebles her muscular system by sedentary occupation, and\r\nover-stimulates her brain and nervous system, when she becomes a mother,\r\nperpetuates these evils to her offspring. Her children will be born\r\nfeeble and delicate, incapable of sustaining any severe strain of body\r\nor mind. The universal cry now about the ill health of young American\r\ngirls is the fruit of some three generations of neglect of physical\r\nexercise and undue stimulus of brain and nerves. Young girls now are\r\nuniversally _born_ delicate. The most careful hygienic treatment during\r\nchildhood, the strictest attention to diet, dress, and exercise,\r\nsucceeds merely so far as to produce a girl who is healthy so long only\r\nas she does nothing. With the least strain, her delicate organism gives\r\nout, now here, now there. She cannot study without her eyes fail or she\r\nhas headache,--she cannot get up her own muslins, or sweep a room, or\r\npack a trunk, without bringing on a backache,--she goes to a concert or\r\na lecture, and must lie by all the next day from the exertion. If she\r\nskates, she is sure to strain some muscle; or if she falls and strikes\r\nher knee or hits her ankle, a blow that a healthy girl would forget in\r\nfive minutes terminates in some mysterious lameness which confines our\r\npoor sibyl for months.\r\n\r\n\"The young American girl of our times is a creature who has not\r\na particle of vitality to spare,--no reserved stock of force to\r\ndraw upon in cases of family exigency. She is exquisitely strung,\r\nshe is cultivated, she is refined; but she is too nervous, too\r\nwiry, too sensitive,--she burns away too fast; only the easiest\r\nof circumstances, the most watchful of care and nursing, can keep her\r\nwithin the limits of comfortable health: and yet this is the creature\r\nwho must undertake family life in a country where it is next to an\r\nabsolute impossibility to have _permanent_ domestics. Frequent change,\r\noccasional entire break-downs, must be the lot of the majority of\r\nhousekeepers,--particularly those who do not live in cities.\"\r\n\r\n\"In fact,\" said my wife, \"we in America have so far got out of the way\r\nof a womanhood that has any vigor of outline or opulence of physical\r\nproportions, that, when we see a woman made as a woman ought to be, she\r\nstrikes us as a monster. Our willowy girls are afraid of nothing so much\r\nas growing stout; and if a young lady begins to round into proportions\r\nlike the women in Titian's and Giorgione's pictures, she is distressed\r\nabove measure, and begins to make secret inquiries into reducing diet,\r\nand to cling desperately to the strongest corset-lacing as her only\r\nhope. It would require one to be better educated than most of our girls\r\nare, to be willing to look like the Sistine Madonna or the Venus of\r\nMilo.\r\n\r\n\"Once in a while our Italian opera-singers bring to our shores those\r\nglorious physiques which formed the inspiration of Italian painters; and\r\nthen American editors make coarse jokes about Barnum's fat woman, and\r\navalanches, and pretend to be struck with terror at such dimensions.\r\n\r\n\"We should be better instructed, and consider that Italy does us a\r\nfavor, in sending us specimens, not only of higher styles of musical\r\nart, but of a warmer, richer, and more abundant womanly life. The\r\nmagnificent voice is only in keeping with the magnificent proportions of\r\nthe singer. A voice which has no grate, no strain, which flows without\r\neffort,--which does not labor eagerly up to a high note, but alights on\r\nit like a bird from above, there carelessly warbling and trilling,--a\r\nvoice which then without effort sinks into broad, rich, sombre depths of\r\nsoft, heavy chest-tone,--can come only with a physical nature at once\r\nstrong, wide, and fine,--from a nature such as the sun of Italy ripens,\r\nas he does her golden grapes, filling it with the new wine of song.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said I, \"so much for our strictures on Miss Letitia's letter.\r\nWhat comes next?\"\r\n\r\n\"Here is a correspondent who answers the question, 'What shall we do\r\nwith her?'--_apropos_ to the case of the distressed young woman which we\r\nconsidered in our November number.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what does he recommend?\"\r\n\r\n\"He tells us that _he_ should advise us to make our distressed woman\r\nMarianne's housekeeper, and to send South for three or four contrabands\r\nfor her to train, and, with great apparent complacency, seems to think\r\nthat course will solve all similar cases of difficulty.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's quite a man's view of the subject,\" said Jennie. \"They think any\r\nwoman who isn't particularly fitted to do anything else can keep house.\"\r\n\r\n\"As if housekeeping were not the very highest craft and mystery of\r\nsocial life,\" said I. \"I admit that our sex speak too unadvisedly on\r\nsuch topics, and, being well instructed by my household priestess, will\r\nhumbly suggest the following ideas to my correspondent.\r\n\r\n\"1st. A woman is not of course fit to be a housekeeper because she is a\r\nwoman of good education and refinement.\r\n\r\n\"2d. If she were, a family with young children in it is not the proper\r\nplace to establish a school for untaught contrabands, however desirable\r\ntheir training may be.\r\n\r\n\"A woman of good education and good common-sense may _learn_ to be a\r\ngood housekeeper, as she learns any trade, by going into a good family\r\nand practising first one and then another branch of the business, till\r\nfinally she shall acquire the comprehensive knowledge to direct all.\r\n\r\n\"The next letter I will read.\r\n\r\n    \"'DEAR MR. CROWFIELD,--Your papers relating to the domestic\r\n     problem have touched upon a difficulty which threatens to\r\n     become a matter of life and death with me.\r\n\r\n     \"'I am a young man, with good health, good courage, and good\r\n     prospects. I have, for a young man, a fair income, and a\r\n     prospect of its increase. But my business requires me to reside\r\n     in a country town near a great manufacturing city. The demand\r\n     for labor there has made such a drain on the female population\r\n     of the vicinity, that it seems, for a great part of the time,\r\n     impossible to keep any servants at all; and what we can hire\r\n     are of the poorest quality, and want exorbitant wages. My wife\r\n     was a well-trained housekeeper, and knows perfectly all that\r\n     pertains to the care of a family; but she has three little\r\n     children, and a delicate babe only a few weeks old; and _can_\r\n     any one woman do all that is needed for such a household?\r\n     Something must be trusted to servants; and what is thus trusted\r\n     brings such confusion and waste and dirt into our house, and\r\n     the poor woman is constantly distraught between the disgust of\r\n     having them and the utter impossibility of doing without them.\r\n\r\n     \"'Now it has been suggested that we remedy the trouble by\r\n     paying higher wages; but I find that for the very highest wages\r\n     I secure only the most miserable service; and yet, poor as it\r\n     is, we are obliged to put up with it, because there is an\r\n     amount of work to be done in our family that is absolutely\r\n     beyond my wife's strength.\r\n\r\n     \"'I see her health wearing away under these trials, her life\r\n     made a burden; I feel no power to help her; and I ask you, Mr.\r\n     Crowfield, What are we to do? What is to become of family life\r\n     in this country?\r\n\r\n    \"'Yours truly,\r\n\r\n    \"'A YOUNG FAMILY MAN.'\r\n\r\n\"My friend's letter,\" said I, \"touches upon the very hinge of the\r\ndifficulty of domestic life with the present generation.\r\n\r\n\"The real, vital difficulty, after all, in our American life is, that\r\nour country is so wide, so various, so abounding in the richest fields\r\nof enterprise, that in every direction the cry is of the plenteousness\r\nof the harvest and the fewness of the laborers. In short, there really\r\nare not laborers enough to do the work of the country.\r\n\r\n\"Since the war has thrown the whole South open to the competition of\r\nfree labor, the demand for workers is doubled and trebled. Manufactories\r\nof all sorts are enlarging their borders, increasing their machinery,\r\nand calling for more hands. Every article of living is demanded with an\r\nimperativeness and over an extent of territory which set at once\r\nadditional thousands to the task of production. Instead of being easier\r\nto find hands to execute in all branches of useful labor, it is likely\r\nto grow every year more difficult, as new departments of manufacture and\r\ntrade divide the workers. The price of labor, even now higher in this\r\ncountry than in any other, will rise still higher, and thus complicate\r\nstill more the problem of domestic life. Even if a reasonable quota of\r\nintelligent women choose domestic service, the demand will be\r\nincreasingly beyond the supply.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what have you to say to this,\" said my wife, \"seeing you cannot\r\nstop the prosperity of the country?\"\r\n\r\n\"Simply this,--that communities will be driven to organize, as they now\r\ndo in Europe, to lessen the labors of individual families by having some\r\nof the present domestic tasks done out of the house.\r\n\r\n\"In France, for example, no house-keeper counts either washing, ironing,\r\nor bread-making as part of her domestic cares. All the family washing\r\ngoes out to a laundry; and being attended to by those who make that\r\ndepartment of labor a specialty, it comes home in refreshingly beautiful\r\norder.\r\n\r\n\"We in America, though we pride ourselves on our Yankee thrift, are far\r\nbehind the French in domestic economy. If all the families of a\r\nneighborhood should put together the sums they separately spend in\r\nbuying or fitting up and keeping in repair tubs, boilers, and other\r\naccommodations for washing, all that is consumed or wasted in soap,\r\nstarch, bluing, fuel, together with the wages and board of an extra\r\nservant, the aggregate would suffice to fit up a neighborhood laundry,\r\nwhere one or two capable women could do easily and well what ten or\r\nfifteen women now do painfully and ill, and to the confusion and\r\nderangement of all other family processes.\r\n\r\n\"The model laundries for the poor in London had facilities which would\r\nenable a woman to do both the washing and ironing of a small family in\r\nfrom two to three hours, and were so arranged that a very few women\r\ncould with ease do the work of the neighborhood.\r\n\r\n\"But in the absence of an establishment of this sort, the housekeepers\r\nof a country village might help themselves very much by owning a mangle\r\nin common, to which all the heavier parts of the ironing could be sent.\r\nAmerican ingenuity has greatly improved the machinery of the mangle. It\r\nis no longer the heavy, cumbersome structure that it used to be in the\r\nOld World, but a compact, neat piece of apparatus, made in three or four\r\ndifferent sizes to suit different-sized apartments.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. H. F. Bond of Waltham, Massachusetts, now manufactures these\r\narticles, and sends them to all parts of the country. The smallest of\r\nthem does not take up much more room than a sewing-machine, can be\r\nturned by a boy of ten or twelve, and thus in the course of an hour or\r\ntwo the heaviest and most fatiguing part of a family ironing may be\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\n\"I should certainly advise the 'Young Family Man' with a delicate wife\r\nand uncertain domestic help to fortify his kitchen with one of these\r\nfixtures.\r\n\r\n\"But after all, I still say that the quarter to which I look for the\r\nsolution of the American problem of domestic life is a wise use of the\r\nprinciple of association.\r\n\r\n\"The future model village of New England, as I see it, shall have for\r\nthe use of its inhabitants not merely a town lyceum-hall and a town\r\nlibrary, but a town laundry, fitted up with conveniences such as no\r\nprivate house can afford, and paying a price to the operators which will\r\nenable them to command an excellence of work such as private families\r\nseldom realize. It will also have a town bakery, where the best of\r\nfamily bread, white, brown, and of all grains, shall be compounded; and\r\nlastly a town cook-shop, where soup and meats may be bought, ready for\r\nthe table. Those of us who have kept house abroad remember the ease with\r\nwhich our foreign establishments were carried on. A suite of elegant\r\napartments, a courier, and one female servant were the foundation of\r\ndomestic life. Our courier boarded us at a moderate expense, and the\r\nservant took care of our rooms. Punctually to the dinner-hour every day,\r\nour dinner came in on the head of a porter from a neighboring cook-shop.\r\nA large chest lined with tin, and kept warm by a tiny charcoal stove in\r\nthe centre, being deposited in an ante-room, from it came forth, first,\r\nsoup, then fish, then roast of various names, and lastly pastry and\r\nconfections,--far more courses than any reasonable Christian needs to\r\nkeep him in healthy condition; and dinner being over, our box with its\r\n_debris_ went out of the house, leaving a clear field.\r\n\r\n\"Now I put it to the distressed 'Young Family Man' whether these three\r\ninstitutions of a bakery, a cook-shop, and a laundry, in the village\r\nwhere he lives would not virtually annihilate his household cares, and\r\nrestore peace and comfort to his now distracted family.\r\n\r\n\"There really is no more reason why every family should make its own\r\nbread than its own butter,--why every family should do its own washing\r\nand ironing than its own tailoring or mantua-making. In France, where\r\ncertainly the arts of economy are well studied, there is some specialty\r\nfor many domestic needs for which we keep servants. The beautiful inlaid\r\nfloors are kept waxed and glossy by a professional gentleman who wears a\r\nbrush on his foot-sole, skates gracefully over the surface, and, leaving\r\nall right, departeth. Many families, each paying a small sum, keep this\r\nservant in common.\r\n\r\n\"Now if ever there was a community which needed to study the art of\r\nliving, it is our American one; for at present, domestic life is so\r\nwearing and so oppressive as seriously to affect health and happiness.\r\nWhatever has been done abroad in the way of comfort and convenience can\r\nbe done here; and the first neighborhood that shall set the example of\r\ndividing the tasks and burdens of life by the judicious use of the\r\nprinciple of _association_ will initiate a most important step in the\r\nway of national happiness and prosperity.\r\n\r\n\"My solution, then, of the domestic problem may be formulized as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n\"1st. That women make self-helpfulness and family helpfulness\r\nfashionable, and every woman use her muscles daily in enough household\r\nwork to give her a good digestion.\r\n\r\n\"2d. That the situation of a domestic be made so respectable and\r\nrespected that well-educated American women shall be induced to take it\r\nas a training-school for their future family life.\r\n\r\n\"3d. That families by association lighten the multifarious labors of the\r\ndomestic sphere.\r\n\r\n\"All of which I humbly submit to the good sense and enterprise of\r\nAmerican readers and workers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRIFFITH GAUNT; OR, JEALOUSY.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nThe two combatants came to the field in a very different spirit. Neville\r\nhad already fought two duels, and been successful in both. He had\r\nconfidence in his skill and in his luck. His conscience, too, was\r\ntolerably clear; for he was the insulted person; and if a bullet should\r\nremove this dangerous rival from his path, why, all the better for him,\r\nand all the worse for the fool who had brought the matter to a bloody\r\nissue, though the balance of the lady's heart inclined his way.\r\n\r\nHe came in high spirits, and rode upon Kate Peyton's gray, to sting his\r\nadversary, and show his contempt of him.\r\n\r\nNot so Griffith Gaunt. His heart was heavy, and foreboded ill. It was\r\nhis first duel, and he expected to be killed. He had played a fool's\r\ngame, and he saw it.\r\n\r\nThe night before the duel he tried hard to sleep; he knew it was not\r\ngiving his nerves fair play to lie thinking all night. But coy sleep, as\r\nusual when most wanted, refused to come. At daybreak the restless man\r\ngave it up in despair, and rose and dressed himself. He wrote that\r\nletter to Catharine, little thinking it would fall into her hands while\r\nhe lived. He ate a little toast, and drank a pint of Burgundy, and then\r\nwandered listlessly about till Major Rickards, his second, arrived.\r\n\r\nThat experienced gentleman brought a surgeon with him,--Mr. Islip.\r\n\r\nMajor Rickards deposited a shallow wooden box in the hall; and the two\r\ngentlemen sat down to a hearty breakfast.\r\n\r\nGriffith took care of his guests, but beyond that spoke scarcely a word;\r\nand the surgeon, after a ghastly attempt at commonplaces, was silent\r\ntoo. Major Rickards satisfied his appetite first, and then, finding his\r\ncompanions dumb, set to work to keep up their spirits. He entertained\r\nthem with a narrative of the personal encounters he had witnessed, and\r\nespecially of one in which his principal had fallen on his face at the\r\nfirst fire, and the antagonist had sprung into the air, and both had\r\nlain dead as door-nails, and never moved, nor even winked, after that\r\nsingle discharge.\r\n\r\nGriffith sat under this chilling talk for more than an hour.\r\n\r\nAt last he rose gloomily, and said it was time to go.\r\n\r\n\"Got your tools, Doctor?\" inquired the Major.\r\n\r\nThe surgeon nodded slightly. He was more discreet than his friend.\r\n\r\nWhen they had walked nearly a mile in the snow, the Major began to\r\ncomplain.\r\n\r\n\"The Devil!\" said he; \"this is queer walking. My boots are full of\r\nwater. I shall catch my death.\"\r\n\r\nThe surgeon smiled satirically, comparing silent Griffith's peril with\r\nhis second's.\r\n\r\nGriffith took no notice. He went like Fortitude plodding to Execution.\r\n\r\nMajor Rickards fell behind, and whispered Mr. Islip,--\r\n\r\n\"Don't like his looks; doesn't march like a winner. A job for you or the\r\nsexton, you mark my words.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey toiled up Scutchemsee Nob, and when they reached the top, they saw\r\nNeville and his second, Mr. Hammersley, riding towards them. The pair\r\nhad halters as well as bridles, and, dismounting, made their nags fast\r\nto a large blackthorn that grew there. The seconds then stepped forward,\r\nand saluted each other with formal civility.\r\n\r\nGriffith looked at the gray horse, and ground his teeth. The sight of\r\nthe animal in Neville's possession stirred up his hate, and helped to\r\nsteel his heart. He stood apart, still, pale, and gloomy.\r\n\r\nThe seconds stepped out fifteen paces, and placed the men. Then they\r\nloaded two pair of pistols, and put a pistol in each man's hand.\r\n\r\nMajor Rickards took that opportunity to advise his principal.\r\n\r\n\"Stand sharp. Keep your arm close to your side. Don't fire too high. How\r\ndo you feel?\"\r\n\r\n\"Like a man who must die, but will try to die in company.\"\r\n\r\nThe seconds now withdrew to their places; and the rivals held their\r\npistols lowered, but fixed their deadly eyes on each other.\r\n\r\nThe eye, in such a circumstance, is a terrible thing: it is literally a\r\nweapon of destruction; for it directs the deadly hand that guides the\r\ndeadly bullet. Moreover, the longer and the more steadily the duellist\r\nfixes his eye on his adversary, the less likely he is to miss.\r\n\r\nGriffith was very pale, but dogged. Neville was serious, but firm. Both\r\neyed each other unflinchingly.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, are you ready?\" asked Neville's second.\r\n\r\n    {\"Yes.\"\r\n    {\r\n    {\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said Major Rickards, \"you will fire when I let fall this\r\nhandkerchief, and not before. Mark me, Gentlemen: to prevent mistakes, I\r\nshall say, 'One,--two,--three!' and then drop the handkerchief. Now,\r\nthen, once more, are you quite ready?\"\r\n\r\n    {\"Yes.\"\r\n    {\r\n    {\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"One,----two,----three!\"\r\n\r\nHe dropped the handkerchief, and both gentlemen fired simultaneously.\r\nMr. Neville's hat spun into the air; Griffith stood untouched.\r\n\r\nThe bullet had passed through Neville's hat, and had actually cut a lane\r\nthrough his magnificent hair.\r\n\r\nThe seconds now consulted, and it was intimated to Griffith that a word\r\nof apology would be accepted by his antagonist. Griffith declined to\r\nutter a syllable of apology.\r\n\r\nTwo more pistols were given the men.\r\n\r\n\"Aim lower,\" said Rickards.\r\n\r\n\"I mean to,\" said Griffith.\r\n\r\nThe seconds withdrew, and the men eyed each other,--Griffith dogged and\r\npale, as before, Neville not nearly so self-assured: Griffith's bullet,\r\nin grazing him, had produced the effect of a sharp, cold current of air\r\nno wider than a knife. It was like Death's icy fore-finger laid on his\r\nhead, to mark him for the next shot,--as men mark a tree, then come\r\nagain and fell it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"One,----two,----three!\"\r\n\r\nAnd Griffith's pistol missed fire; but Neville's went off, and\r\nGriffith's arm sank powerless, and his pistol rolled out of his hand. He\r\nfelt a sharp twinge, and then something trickle down his arm.\r\n\r\nThe surgeon and both seconds ran to him.\r\n\r\n\"Nay, it is nothing,\" said he; \"I shoot far better with my left hand\r\nthan my right. Give me another pistol, and let me have fair play. He has\r\nhit me; and now I'll hit him.\"\r\n\r\nBoth seconds agreed this was impossible.\r\n\r\n\"It is the chance of war,\" said Major Rickards; \"you cannot be allowed\r\nto take a cool shot at Mr. Neville. If you fire again, so must he.\"\r\n\r\n\"The affair may very well end here,\" said Mr. Hammersley. \"I understand\r\nthere was some provocation on our side; and on behalf of the party\r\ninsulted I am content to let the matter end, Mr. Gaunt being wounded.\"\r\n\r\n\"I demand my second shot to his third,\" said Griffith, sternly; \"he will\r\nnot decline, unless he is a poltroon, as well as--what I called him.\"\r\n\r\nThe nature of this reply was communicated to Neville, and the seconds,\r\nwith considerable reluctance, loaded two more pistols; and during the\r\nprocess Major Rickards glanced at the combatants.\r\n\r\nGriffith exasperated by his wound and his jealousy, was wearing out the\r\nchivalrous courage of his adversary; and the Major saw it. His keen eye\r\nnoticed that Neville was getting restless, and looking confounded at his\r\ndespised rival's pertinacity, and that Gaunt was more dogged and more\r\ndeadly.\r\n\r\n\"My man will kill yours this time,\" said he, quietly, to Neville's\r\nsecond; \"I can see if in his eye. He is hungry: t' other has had his\r\nbellyful.\"\r\n\r\nOnce more the men were armed, and the seconds withdrew to their places,\r\nintimating that this was the last shot they would allow under any\r\ncircumstances whatever.\r\n\r\n\"Are you both ready?\"\r\n\r\n    {\"Yes.\"\r\n    {\r\n    {\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nA faint wail seemed to echo the response.\r\n\r\nAll heard it, and in that superstitious age believed it to be some\r\nmysterious herald of death.\r\n\r\nIt suspended even Major Rickards's voice a minute. He recovered himself,\r\nhowever, and once more his soldier-like tones rang in the keen air:--\r\n\r\n\"One,----\"\r\n\r\nThere was a great rushing, and a pounding of the hard ground, and a\r\nscarlet Amazon galloped in, and drew up in the middle, right between the\r\nlevelled pistols.\r\n\r\nEvery eye had been so bent on the combatants, that Kate Peyton and her\r\nhorse seemed to have sprung out of the very earth. And there she sat,\r\npale as ashes, on the steaming piebald, and glanced from pistol to\r\npistol.\r\n\r\nThe duellists stared in utter amazement, and instinctively lowered their\r\nweapons; for she had put herself right in their line of fire with a\r\nrecklessness that contrasted nobly with her fear for others. In short,\r\nthis apparition literally petrified them all, seconds as well as\r\ncombatants.\r\n\r\nAnd while they stood open-mouthed, yet dumb, in came the Scamp, and,\r\nwith a brisk assumption of delegated authority, took Griffith's weapon\r\nout of his now unresisting hand, then marched to Neville. He instantly\r\nsaluted Catharine, and then handed his pistol to her seeming agent, with\r\na high-bred and inimitable air of utter nonchalance.\r\n\r\nKate, seeing them, to her surprise, so easily disarmed, raised her hands\r\nand her lovely eyes to heaven, and, in a feeble voice, thanked God and\r\nSaint Nescioquis.\r\n\r\nBut very soon that faint voice quavered away to nothing, and her fair\r\nhead was seen to droop, and her eyes to close; then her body sank slowly\r\nforward like a broken lily, and in another moment she lay fainting on\r\nthe snow beside her steaming horse.\r\n\r\nHe never moved, he was so dead beat too.\r\n\r\nOh, lame and impotent conclusion of a vigorous exploit! Masculine up to\r\nthe crowning point, and then to go and spoil all with \"woman's\r\nweakness\"!\r\n\r\n\"N. B. This is rote sarcasticul,\" as Artemus the Delicious says. Woman's\r\nweakness! If Solomon had planned and Samson executed, they could not\r\nhave served her turn better than this most seasonable swooning did; for,\r\nlo! at her fall, the doughty combatants uttered a yell of dismay, and\r\nthere was an indiscriminate rush towards the fair sufferer.\r\n\r\nBut the surgeon claimed his rights.\r\n\r\n\"This is my business,\" said he, authoritatively. \"Do not crowd on her,\r\nGentlemen: give her air.\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon the duellists and seconds stood respectfully aloof, in a mixed\r\ngroup, and watched with eager interest and pity.\r\n\r\nThe surgeon made a hole in the snow, and laid his fair patient's head\r\nlow.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be alarmed,\" said he; \"she has swooned; that is all.\"\r\n\r\nIt was all mighty fine to say, \"Don't be alarmed.\" But her face was\r\nashy, and her lips the color of lead; and she was so like death, they\r\ncould not help being terribly alarmed; and now, for the first time, the\r\nduellists felt culprits; and as for fighting, every idea of such a thing\r\nwent out of their heads. The rivals now were but rival nurses; and never\r\ndid a lot of women make more fuss over a child than all these\r\nbloodthirsty men did over this Amazon _manquee_. They produced their\r\nlegendary lore. One's grandmother had told him burnt feathers were the\r\nthing; another, from an equally venerable source, had gathered that\r\nthose pink palms must be profanely slapped by the horny hand of\r\nman,--for at no less a price could resuscitation be obtained. The\r\nsurgeon scorning all their legends, Griffith and Neville made hasty\r\nrushes with brandy and usquebaugh; but whether to be taken internally or\r\nexternally they did not say, nor, indeed, know, but only thrust their\r\nflasks wildly on the doctor; and he declined them loftily. He melted\r\nsnow in his hand, and dashed it hard in her face, and put salts close to\r\nher pretty little nostrils. And this he repeated many times without\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nBut at last her lips began to turn from lead color to white, and then\r\nfrom white to pink, and her heavenly eyes to open again, and her mouth\r\nto murmur things pitiably small and not bearing on the matter in hand.\r\n\r\nHer cheek was still colorless, when her consciousness came back, and she\r\nfound she was lying on the ground with ever so many gentlemen looking at\r\nher.\r\n\r\nAt that, Modesty alarmed sent the blood at once rushing to her pale\r\ncheek.\r\n\r\nA lovely lily seemed turning to a lovely rose before their eyes.\r\n\r\nThe next thing was, she hid that blushing face in her hands, and began\r\nto whimper.\r\n\r\nThe surgeon encouraged her: \"Nay, we are all friends,\" he whispered,\r\npaternally.\r\n\r\nShe half parted her fingers and peered through them at Neville and\r\nGaunt. Then she remembered all, and began to cry hysterically.\r\n\r\nNew dismay of the unprofessionals!\r\n\r\n\"_Now_, Gentlemen, if you will lend me your flasks,\" said Mr. Islip,\r\nmighty calmly.\r\n\r\nGriffith and Neville were instantly at his side, each with a flask.\r\n\r\nThe surgeon administered snow and brandy. Kate sipped these, and gulped\r\ndown her sobs, and at last cried composedly.\r\n\r\nBut when it came to sipping brandied snow and crying comfortably, Major\r\nRickards's anxiety gave place to curiosity. Without taking his eye off\r\nher, he beckoned Mr. Hammersley apart, and whispered,--\r\n\r\n\"Who the Deuse is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you know?\" whispered the other in return. \"Why, Mistress Peyton\r\nherself.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! the girl it is all about? Well, I never heard of such a thing:\r\nthe _causa belli_ to come _galloping_ and _swooning_ on the field of\r\nbattle, and so stop the fighting! What will our ladies do next? By\r\nHeaven! she is worth fighting for, though. Which is the happy man, I\r\nwonder? She doesn't look at either of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said the gentleman, \"that is more than I know, more than Neville\r\nknows, more than anybody knows.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bet you a guinea _she_ knows,--and lets it out before she leaves the\r\nfield,\" said Major Rickards.\r\n\r\nMr. Hammersley objected to an even bet; but said he would venture one to\r\nthree she did not. It was an age of bets.\r\n\r\n\"Done!\" said the Major.\r\n\r\nBy this time Kate had risen, with Mr. Islip's assistance, and was now\r\nstanding with her hand upon the piebald's mane. She saw Rickards and\r\nHammersley were whispering about her, and she felt very uneasy: so she\r\ntold Mr. Islip, timidly, she desired to explain her conduct to _all_ the\r\ngentlemen present, and avert false reports.\r\n\r\nThey were soon all about her, and she began, with the most engaging\r\nembarrassment, by making excuses for her weakness. She said she had\r\nridden all the way from home, fasting; that was what had upset her. The\r\ngentlemen took the cue directly, and vowed eagerly and unanimously it\r\nwas enough to upset a porter.\r\n\r\n\"But, indeed,\" resumed Kate, blushing, \"I did not come here to make a\r\nfuss, and be troublesome, but to prevent mischief, and clear up the\r\nstrangest misunderstanding between two worthy gentlemen, that are, both\r\nof them, my good friends.\"\r\n\r\nShe paused, and there was a chilling silence: everybody felt she was\r\ngetting on ticklish ground now. She knew that well enough herself. But\r\nshe had a good rudder to steer by, called Mother-Wit.\r\n\r\nSays she, with inimitable coolness,--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Gaunt is an old friend of mine, and a little too sensitive where I\r\nam concerned. Some chatterbox has been and told him Mr. Neville should\r\nsay I have changed horses with him; and on that the gossips put their\r\nown construction. Mr. Gaunt hears all this, and applies insulting terms\r\nto Mr. Neville. Nay, do not deny it, Mr. Gaunt, for I have it here in\r\nyour own handwriting.\r\n\r\n\"As for Mr. Neville, he merely defends his honor, and is little to\r\nblame. But now I shall tell the true story about these horses, and make\r\nyou all ashamed of this sorry quarrel.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, thus it is. A few days ago Mr. Gaunt bade me farewell, and\r\nstarted for foreign parts. He had not been long gone, when word came\r\nfrom Bolton that Mr. Charlton was no more. You know how sudden it was.\r\nConsider, Gentlemen: him dead, and his heir riding off to the Continent\r\nin ignorance. So I thought, 'Oh, what shall I do?' Just then Mr. Neville\r\nvisited me, and I told him: on that he offered me his piebald horse to\r\ncarry the news after Mr. Gaunt, because my gray was too tired: it was\r\nthe day we drew Yew-tree Brow, and crossed Harrowden Brook, you\r\nknow,\"----\r\n\r\nGriffith interrupted her.\r\n\r\n\"Stay a bit,\" said he: \"this is news to me. You never told me he had\r\nlent you the piebald nag to do me a good turn.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did I not?\" said Kate, mighty innocently. \"Well, but I tell you now.\r\nAsk him: he cannot deny it. As for the rest, it was all done in a hurry:\r\nMr. Neville had no horse now to ride home with; he did me the justice to\r\nthink I should be very ill pleased, were he to trudge home afoot and\r\nsuffer for his courtesy; so he borrowed my gray to keep him out of the\r\nmire; and, indeed, the ways were fouler than usual, with the rains. Was\r\nthere any ill in all this? HONI SOIT QUI MAL Y PENSE! say I.\"\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen all sided loudly with her on this appeal,--except Neville,\r\nwho held his tongue, and smiled at her plausibility, and Griffith, who\r\nhung his head at her siding with Neville.\r\n\r\nAt last he spoke, and said, sorrowfully,--\r\n\r\n\"If you did exchange horses with him, of course I have only to ask his\r\npardon--and go.\"\r\n\r\nCatharine reflected a moment before she replied.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said she, \"I did exchange, and I did not. Why quarrel about a\r\nword? Certainly he took my horse, and I took his; but it was only for\r\nthe nonce. Mr. Neville is foreign-bred, and an example to us all: he\r\nknows his piebald is worth two of my gray, and so he was too fine a\r\ngentleman to send me back my old hunter and ask for his young charger.\r\nHe waited for me to do that; and if anybody deserves to be shot, it must\r\nbe Me. But, dear heart, I did not foresee all this fuss; I said to\r\nmyself, 'La, Mr. Neville will be sure to call on my father or me some\r\nday, or else I shall be out on the piebald and meet him on the gray, and\r\nthen we can each take our own again.' Was I so far out in my reckoning?\r\nIs not that my Rosinante yonder? Here, Tom Leicester, you put my\r\nside-saddle on that gray horse, and the man's saddle on the piebald\r\nthere. And now, Griffith Gaunt, it is your turn: you must withdraw your\r\ninjurious terms, and end this superlative folly.\"\r\n\r\nGriffith hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" said Kate, \"consider: Mr. Neville is esteemed by all the county:\r\nyou are the only gentleman in it who has ever uttered a disparaging word\r\nagainst him. Are you sure you are more free from passion and prejudice\r\nand wiser than all the county? Oblige _me_, and do what is right. Come,\r\nGriffith Gaunt, let your reason unsay the barbarous words your passion\r\nhath uttered against a worthy gentleman whom we all esteem.\"\r\n\r\nHer habitual influence, and these last words, spoken with gentle and\r\npersuasive dignity, turned the scale. Griffith turned to Neville, and\r\nsaid in a low voice that he began to fear he had been hasty, and used\r\nharsher words than the occasion justified: he was going to stammer out\r\nsomething more, but Neville interrupted him with a noble gesture.\r\n\r\n\"That is enough, Mr. Gaunt,\" said he. \"I do not feel quite blameless in\r\nthe matter, and have no wish to mortify an honorable adversary\r\nunnecessarily.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very handsomely said,\" put in Major Rickards; \"and now let me have a\r\nword. I say that both gentlemen have conducted themselves like\r\nmen--under fire; and that honor is satisfied, and the misunderstanding\r\nat an end. As for my principal here, he has shown he can fight, and now\r\nhe has shown he can hear reason against himself, when the lips of beauty\r\nutter it. I approve his conduct from first to last, and am ready to\r\ndefend it in all companies, and in the field, should it ever be\r\nimpugned.\"\r\n\r\nKate colored with pleasure, and gave her hand eloquently to the Major.\r\nHe bowed over it, and kissed the tips of her fingers.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Sir,\" she said, looking on him now as a friend, \"I dreamed I saw\r\nMr. Neville lying dead upon the snow, with the blood trickling from his\r\ntemple.\"\r\n\r\nAt this Neville's dark cheek glowed with pleasure. So! it was her\r\nanxiety on _his_ account had brought her here.\r\n\r\nGriffith heard too, and sighed patiently.\r\n\r\nAssured by Major Rickards that there neither could nor should be any\r\nmore fighting, Kate made her adieus, mounted her gray horse, and rode\r\noff, discreetly declining all attendance. She beckoned Tom Leicester,\r\nhowever. But he pretended not to see the signal, and let her go alone.\r\nHis motive for lingering behind was characteristic, and will transpire\r\nshortly.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she was gone, Griffith Gaunt quietly reminded the surgeon\r\nthat there was a bullet in his arm all this time.\r\n\r\n\"Bless my soul!\" said Mr. Islip, \"I forgot that, I was so taken up with\r\nthe lady.\"\r\n\r\nGriffith's coat was now taken off, and the bullet searched for: it had\r\nentered the fleshy part of his arm below the elbow, and, passing round\r\nthe bone, projected just under the skin. The surgeon made a slight\r\nincision, and then, pressing with his finger and thumb, out it rolled.\r\nGriffith put it in his pocket.\r\n\r\nNeville had remained out of civility, and now congratulated his late\r\nantagonist, and himself, that it was no worse.\r\n\r\nThe last words that passed between the rivals, on this occasion, were\r\nworth recording, and characteristic of the time.\r\n\r\nNeville addressed Gaunt with elaborate courtesy, and to this effect:--\r\n\r\n\"I find myself in a difficulty, Sir. You did me the honor to invite me\r\nto Mr. Charlton's funeral, and I accepted; but now I fear to intrude a\r\nguest, the sight of whom may be disagreeable to you. And, on the other\r\nhand, my absence might be misconstrued as a mark of disrespect, or of a\r\npetty hostility I am far from feeling. Be pleased, therefore, to dispose\r\nof me entirely in this matter.\"\r\n\r\nGriffith reflected.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" said he, \"there is an old saying, 'Let every tub stand on its own\r\nbottom.' The deceased wished you to follow him to the grave, and\r\ntherefore I would on no account have you absent. Besides, now I think of\r\nit, there will be less gossip about this unfortunate business, if our\r\nneighbors see you under my roof, and treated with due consideration\r\nthere, as you will be.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not doubt that, Sir, from so manly an adversary; and I shall do\r\nmyself the honor to come.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was Neville's reply. The rivals then saluted each other profoundly,\r\nand parted.\r\n\r\nHammersley and Rickards lingered behind their principals to settle their\r\nlittle bet about Kate's affections: and, by the by, they were indiscreet\r\nenough to discuss this delicate matter within a dozen yards of Tom\r\nLeicester: they forgot that \"little pitchers have long ears.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCatharine Peyton rode slowly home, and thought it all over as she went,\r\nand worried herself finely. She was one that winced at notoriety; and\r\nshe could not hope to escape it now. How the gossips would talk about\r\nher! they would say the gentlemen had fought about _her_; and she had\r\nparted them for love of one of them. And then the gentlemen themselves!\r\nThe strict neutrality she had endeavored to maintain on Scutchemsee Nob,\r\nin order to make peace, would it not keep them both her suitors? She\r\nforesaw she should be pulled to pieces, and live in hot water, and be\r\n\"the talk of the county.\"\r\n\r\nThere were but two ways out: she must marry one of them, and petition\r\nthe other not to shoot him; or else she must take the veil, and so\r\nescape them both.\r\n\r\nShe preferred the latter alternative. She was more enthusiastic in\r\nreligion than in any earthly thing; and now the angry passions of men\r\nthrust her the same road that her own devout mind had always drawn her.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she got home, she sent a message to Father Francis, who drove\r\nher conscience, and begged him to come and advise her.\r\n\r\nAfter that, she did the wisest thing, perhaps, she had done all\r\nday,--went to bed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nThe sun was just setting when Catharine's maid came into her room and\r\ntold her Father Francis was below. She sent down to say she counted on\r\nhis sleeping at Peyton Hall, and she would come down to him in half an\r\nhour. She then ordered a refection to be prepared for him in her\r\nboudoir; and made her toilet with all reasonable speed, not to keep him\r\nwaiting. Her face beamed with quiet complacency now, for the holy man's\r\nvery presence in the house was a comfort to her.\r\n\r\nFather Francis was a very stout, muscular man, with a ruddy countenance;\r\nhe never wore gloves, and you saw at once he was not a gentleman by\r\nbirth. He had a fine voice: it was deep, mellow, and, when he chose,\r\nsonorous. This, and his person, ample, but not obese, gave him great\r\nweight, especially with his female pupils. If he was not quite so much\r\nreverenced by the men, yet he was both respected and liked; in fact, he\r\nhad qualities that make men welcome in every situation,--good humor,\r\ngood sense, and tact. A good son of his Church, and early trained to let\r\nno occasion slip of advancing her interests.\r\n\r\nI wish my readers could have seen the meeting between Catharine Peyton\r\nand this burly ecclesiastic. She came into the drawing-room with that\r\nimperious air and carriage which had made her so unpopular with her own\r\nsex; and at the bare sight of Father Francis, drooped and bent in a\r\nmoment as she walked; and her whole body indicated a submissiveness,\r\ngraceful, but rather abject: it was as if a young poplar should turn to\r\na weeping willow in half a moment. Thus metamorphosed, the Beauty of\r\nCumberland glided up to Francis, and sank slowly on her knees before\r\nhim, crossed her hands on her bosom, lowered her lovely head, and\r\nawaited his benediction.\r\n\r\nThe father laid two big, coarse hands, with enormous fingers, on that\r\nthorough-bred head and golden hair, and blessed her business-like.\r\n\r\n    \"The hand of less employment hath the daintier sense.\"--_Shakspeare_.\r\n\r\nFather Francis blessed so many of these pretty creatures every week,\r\nthat he had long outgrown your fine, romantic way of blessing a body.\r\n(We manage these things better in the theatre.) Then he lent her his\r\nhand to rise, and asked her in what she required his direction at\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n\"In that which shall decide my whole life,\" said she.\r\n\r\nFrancis responded by a look of paternal interest.\r\n\r\n\"But first,\" murmured she, \"let me confess to you, and obtain\r\nabsolution, if I may. Ah, Father, my sins have been many since last\r\nconfession!\"\r\n\r\n\"Be it so,\" said Father Francis, resignedly. \"Confession is the best\r\npreface to Direction.\" And he seated himself with a certain change of\r\nmanner, an easy assumption of authority.\r\n\r\n\"Nay, Father,\" suggested the lady, \"we shall be more private in my\r\nroom.\"\r\n\r\n\"As you will, Mistress Catharine Peyton,\" said the priest, returning to\r\nhis usual manner.\r\n\r\nSo then the fair penitent led her spiritual judge captive up another\r\nflight of stairs, and into her little boudoir. A cheerful wood fire\r\ncrackled and flamed up the chimney, and a cloth had been laid on a side\r\ntable: cold turkey and chine graced the board, and a huge glass magnum\r\nof purple Burgundy glowed and shone in the rays of the cheery fire.\r\n\r\nFather Francis felt cozy at the sight; and at once accepted Kate's\r\ninvitation to take some nourishment before entering on the labor of\r\nlistening to the catalogue of her crimes. \"I fasted yesterday,\" he\r\nmuttered; and the zeal with which he attacked the viands rendered the\r\nstatement highly credible.\r\n\r\nHe invited Kate to join him, but she declined.\r\n\r\nHe returned more than once to the succulent meats, and washed all down\r\nwith a pint of the fine old Burgundy, perfumed and purple. Meantime she\r\nof the laity sat looking into the fire with heavenly-minded eyes.\r\n\r\nAt last, with a gentle sigh of content, the ghostly father installed\r\nhimself in an arm-chair by the fire, and invited his penitent to begin.\r\n\r\nShe took a footstool and brought it to his side, so that, in confessing\r\nher blacker vices, she might be able to whisper them in his very ear.\r\nShe kneeled on her little footstool, put her hands across her breast,\r\nand in this lowly attitude murmured softly after this fashion, with a\r\ncontrite voice:--\r\n\r\n\"I have to accuse myself of many vices. Alas! in one short fortnight I\r\nhave accumulated the wickedness of a life. I have committed the seven\r\ndeadly sins. I have been guilty of Pride, Wrath, Envy, Disobedience,\r\nImmodesty, Vanity, Concupiscence, Fibs,\"----\r\n\r\n\"Gently, daughter,\" said the priest, quietly; \"these terms are too\r\ngeneral: give me instances. Let us begin with Wrath: ah! we are all\r\nprone to that.\"\r\n\r\nThe fair penitent sighed, and said,--\r\n\r\n\"Especially me. Example: I was angry beyond reason with my maid, Ruth.\r\n(She does comb my hair so uncouthly!) So, then, the other night, when I\r\nwas in trouble, and most needed soothing by being combed womanly, she\r\ngets thinking of Harry, that helps in the stable, and she tears away at\r\nmy hair. I started up and screamed out, 'Oh, you clumsy thing! go\r\ncurry-comb my horse, and send that oaf your head is running on to handle\r\nmy hair.' And I told her my grandam would have whipped her well for it,\r\nbut nowadays mistresses were the only sufferers: we had lost the use of\r\nour hands, we are grown so squeamish. And I stamped like a fury, and\r\nsaid, 'Get you gone out of the room!' and 'I hated the sight of her!'\r\nAnd the poor girl went from me, crying, without a word, being a better\r\nChristian than her mistress. _Mea culpa! mea culpa!_\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you slap her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, Father, not so bad as that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you quite sure you did not slap her?\" asked Francis, quietly.\r\n\r\n\"Nay. But I had a mind to. My heart slapped her, if my hand forbore.\r\nAlas!\"\r\n\r\n\"Had she hurt you?\"\r\n\r\n\"That she did,--but only my head. I hurt her heart: for the poor wench\r\nloves me dear,--the Lord knows for what.\"\r\n\r\n\"Humph!--proceed to Pride.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Father. I do confess that I was greatly puffed up with the praises\r\nof men. I was proud of the sorriest things: of jumping a brook, when't\r\nwas my horse jumped it, and had jumped it better with a fly on his back\r\nthan the poor worm Me; of my good looks, forgetting that God gave them\r\nme; and besides, I am no beauty, when all is done; it is all their\r\nflattery. And at my Lady Munster's dinner I pridefully walked out before\r\nMistress Davies, the rich cheesemonger's wife, that is as proud of her\r\nmoney as I of my old blood, (God forgive two fools!) which I had no\r\nright to do,--a maid to walk before a wife; and oh, Father, I whispered\r\nthe gentleman who led me out,--it was Mr. Neville\"----\r\n\r\nHere the penitent put one hand before her face, and hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"Well, daughter, half-confession is no confession. You said to Mr.\r\nNeville?\"----\r\n\r\n\"I said, 'Nothing comes after cheese.'\"\r\n\r\nThis revelation was made most dolefully.\r\n\r\n\"It was pert and unbecoming,\" said Father Francis, gravely, though a\r\ntwinkle in his eye showed that he was not so profoundly shocked as his\r\npenitent appeared to be. \"But go to graver matters. Immodesty, said you?\r\nI shall be very sorry, if this is so. You did not use to be immodest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Father, I hope I have not altogether laid aside modesty;\r\notherwise it would be time for me to die, let alone to confess; but sure\r\nit cannot be modest of me to ride after a gentleman and take him a\r\nletter. And then that was not enough: I heard of a duel,--and what did I\r\ndo but ride to Scutchemsee Nob, and interfere? What gentlewoman ever was\r\nso bold? I was not their wife, you know,--neither of them's.\"\r\n\r\n\"Humph!\" said the priest, \"I have already heard a whisper of this,--but\r\ntold to your credit. _Beati pacifici_: Blessed are the peacemakers. You\r\nhad better lay that matter before me by-and-by, as your director. As\r\nyour confessor, tell me why you accuse yourself of concupiscence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas!\" said the young lady, \"scarce a day passes that I do not offend\r\nin _that_ respect. Example: last Friday, dining abroad, the cooks sent\r\nup a dish of collops. Oh, Father, they smelt so nice! and I had been\r\na-hunting. First I smelt them, and that I couldn't help. But then I\r\nforgot _custodia oculorum_, and I eyed them. And the next thing was,\r\npresently--somehow--two of 'em were on my plate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very wrong,\" said Francis; \"but that is a harsher term than I should\r\nhave applied to this longing of a hungry woman for collops o' Friday.\r\nPray, what do you understand by that big word?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, you explained it yourself, in your last sermon. It means 'unruly\r\nand inordinate desires.' Example: Edith Hammersley told me I was mad to\r\nride in scarlet, and me so fair and my hair so light. 'Green or purple\r\nis your color,' says she; and soon after this didn't I see in Stanhope\r\ntown the loveliest piece of purple broadcloth? Oh, Father, it had a\r\ngloss like velvet, and the sun did so shine on it as it lay in the\r\nshop-window; it was fit for a king or a bishop; and I stood and gloated\r\non it, and pined for it, and died for it, and down went the Tenth\r\nCommandment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said Francis, \"the hearts of women are set on vanity! But tell\r\nme,--these unruly affections of yours, are they ever fixed on persons of\r\nthe other sex?\"\r\n\r\nThe fair sinner reflected.\r\n\r\n\"On gentlemen?\" said she. \"Why, they come pestering one of their own\r\naccord. No, no,--I could do without _them_ very well. What I sinfully\r\npine for is meat on a Friday as sure as ever the day comes round, and\r\nhigh-couraged horses to ride, and fine clothes to wear every day in the\r\nweek. _Mea culpa! mea culpa!_\"\r\n\r\nSuch being the dismal state of things, Francis slyly requested her to\r\nleave the seven deadly sins in peace, and go to her small offences: for\r\nhe argued, shrewdly enough, that, since her sins were peccadilloes,\r\nperhaps some of her peccadilloes might turn out to be sins.\r\n\r\n\"Small!\" cried the culprit, turning red,--\"they are none of them small.\"\r\n\r\nI really think she was jealous of her reputation as a sinner of high\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\nHowever, she complied, and, putting up her mouth, murmured a\r\nmiscellaneous confession without end. The accents were soft and musical,\r\nlike a babbling brook; and the sins, such as they were, poor things,\r\nrippled on in endless rotation.\r\n\r\nNow nothing tends more to repose than a purling brook; and ere long\r\nsomething sonorous let the fair culprit know she had lulled her\r\nconfessor asleep.\r\n\r\nShe stopped, indignant. But at that he instantly awoke, (_sublata causa,\r\ntollitur effectus_,) and addressed her thus, with sudden dignity,--\r\n\r\n\"My daughter, you will fast on Monday next, and say two Aves and a\r\nCredo. _Absolvo te._\"\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" said he, \"as I am a practical man, let us get back from the\r\nimaginary world into the real. Speak to me at present as your director;\r\nand mind, you must be serious now, and call things by their right\r\nnames.\"\r\n\r\nUpon this Kate took a seat, and told her story, and showed him the\r\ndifficulty she was in.\r\n\r\nShe then reminded him, that, notwithstanding her unfortunate itch for\r\nthe seven deadly sins, she was a good Catholic, a zealous daughter of\r\nthe Church; and she let him know her desire to retire from both lovers\r\ninto a convent, and so, freed from the world and its temptations, yield\r\nup her soul entire to celestial peace and divine contemplation.\r\n\r\n\"Not so fast,\" said the priest. \"Even zeal is nought without obedience.\r\nIf you could serve the Church better than by going into a convent, would\r\nyou be wilful?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, Father! But how can I serve the Church better than by\r\nrenouncing the world?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps by remaining in the world, as she herself does,--and by making\r\nconverts to the faith. You could hardly serve her worse than by going\r\ninto a convent: for our convents are poor, and you have no means; you\r\nwould be a charge. No, daughter, we want no poor nuns; we have enough of\r\nthem. If you are, as I think, a true and zealous daughter of the Church,\r\nyou must marry, and instil the true faith, with all a mother's art, a\r\nmother's tenderness, into your children. Then the heir to your husband's\r\nestates will be a Catholic, and so the true faith get rooted in the\r\nsoil.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas!\" said Catharine, \"are we to look but to the worldly interests of\r\nthe Church?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are inseparable from her spiritual interests here on earth: our\r\nsouls are not more bound to our bodies.\"\r\n\r\nCatharine was deeply mortified.\r\n\r\n\"So the Church rejects me because I am poor,\" said she, with a sigh.\r\n\r\n\"The Church rejects you not, but only the Convent. No place is less fit\r\nfor you. You have a high spirit, and high religious sentiments: both\r\nwould be mortified and shocked in a nunnery. Think you that\r\nconvent-walls can shut out temptation? I know them better than you: they\r\nare strongholds of vanity, folly, tittle-tattle, and all the meanest\r\nvices of your sex. Nay, I forbid you to think of it: show me now your\r\nfaith by your obedience.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are harsh to me, Father,\" said Catharine, piteously.\r\n\r\n\"I am firm. You are one that needs a tight hand, Mistress. Come, now,\r\nhumility and obedience, these are the Christian graces that best become\r\nyour youth. Say, can the Church, through me, its minister, count on\r\nthese from you? or\" (suddenly letting loose his diapason) \"did you send\r\nfor me to ask advice, and yet go your own way, hiding a high stomach and\r\na wilful heart under a show of humility?\"\r\n\r\nCatharine looked at Father Francis with dismay. This was the first time\r\nthat easy-going priest had shown her how impressive he could be. She was\r\ndownright frightened, and said she hoped she knew better than to defy\r\nher director; she laid her will at his feet, and would obey him like a\r\nchild, as was her duty.\r\n\r\n\"Now I know my daughter again,\" said he, and gave her his horrible paw,\r\nthe which she kissed very humbly, and that matter was settled to her\r\nentire dissatisfaction.\r\n\r\nSoon after that, they were both summoned to supper; but as they went\r\ndown, Kate's maid drew her aside and told her a young man wanted to\r\nspeak to her.\r\n\r\n\"A young man?\" screamed Kate. \"Hang young men! They have got me a fine\r\nscolding just now! Which is it, pray?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is a stranger to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps he comes with a message from some fool. You may bring him to\r\nme in the hall, and stay with us: it may be a thief, for aught I know.\"\r\n\r\nThe maid soon reappeared, followed by Mr. Thomas Leicester.\r\n\r\nThat young worthy had lingered on Scutchemsee Nob, to extract the last\r\ndrop of enjoyment from the situation, by setting up his hat at ten\r\npaces, and firing the gentlemen's pistols at it. I despair of conveying\r\nto any rational reader the satisfaction, keen, though brief, this\r\nafforded him; it was a new sensation: gentlemen's guns he had fired\r\nmany; but duelling-pistols, not one, till that bright hour.\r\n\r\nHe was now come to remind Catharine of his pecuniary claims. Luckily for\r\nhim, she was one who did not need to be reminded of her promises.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it is you, child!\" said she. \"Well, I'll be as good as my word.\"\r\n\r\nShe then dismissed her maid, and went up stairs, and soon returned with\r\ntwo guineas, a crown piece, and three shillings in her hand.\r\n\r\n\"There,\" said she, smiling, \"I am sorry for you, but that is all the\r\nmoney I have in the world.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy's eyes glittered at sight of the coin: he rammed the silver into\r\nhis pocket with hungry rapidity; but he shook his head about the gold.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afeard o' these,\" said he, and eyed them mistrustfully in his palm.\r\n\"These be the friends that get you your throat cut o' dark nights.\r\nMistress, please you keep 'em for me, and let me have a shilling now and\r\nthen when I'm dry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay,\" said Kate, \"but are you not afraid I shall spend your money, now\r\nI have none left of my own?\"\r\n\r\nTom seemed quite struck with the reasonableness of this observation, and\r\nhesitated. However, he concluded to risk it.\r\n\r\n\"You don't look one of the sort to wrong a poor fellow,\" said he; \"and\r\nbesides, you'll have brass to spare of your own before long, I know.\"\r\n\r\nKate opened her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, indeed!\" said she; \"and pray, how do you know that?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Leicester favored her with a knowing wink. He gave her a moment to\r\ndigest this, and then said, almost in a whisper,--\r\n\r\n\"Hearkened the gentlefolks on Scutchemsee Nob, after you was gone home,\r\nMistress.\"\r\n\r\nKate was annoyed.\r\n\r\n\"What! they must be prating as soon as one's back is turned! Talk of\r\nwomen's tongues! Now what did they say, I should like to know?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was about the bet, ye know.\"\r\n\r\n\"A bet? Oh, that is no affair of mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, but it is. Why, 'twas you they were betting on. Seems that old\r\nsoger and Squire Hammersley had laid three guineas to one that you\r\nshould let out which was your fancy of them two.\"\r\n\r\nKate's cheeks were red as fire now; but her delicacy overpowered her\r\ncuriosity, and she would not put any more questions. To be sure, young\r\nHopeful needed none; he was naturally a chatterbox, and he proceeded to\r\ntell her, that, as soon as ever she was gone, Squire Hammersley took a\r\nguinea and offered it to the old soldier, and told him he had won, and\r\nthe old soldier pocketed it. But after that, somehow, Squire Hammersley\r\nlet drop that Mr. Neville was the favorite.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" continued Mr. Leicester, \"what does the old soger do, but pull\r\nout guinea again, and says he,--\r\n\r\n\"'You must have this back; bet is not won: for you do think 'tis\r\nNeville; now I do think 'tis Gaunt.'\r\n\r\n\"So then they fell to argufying and talking a lot o' stuff.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt, the insolent meddlers! Can you remember any of their\r\nnonsense?--not that it is worth remembering, I'll be bound.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me see. Well, Squire Hammersley, he said you owned to dreaming of\r\nSquire Neville,--and that was a sign of love, said he; and, besides, you\r\nsided with him against t'other. But the old soger, he said you called\r\nSquire Gaunt 'Griffith'; and he built on that. Oh, and a said you\r\nchanged the horses back to please our Squire. Says he,--\r\n\r\n\"'You must look to what the lady did; never heed what she said. Why,\r\ntheir sweet lips was only made to kiss us, and deceive us,' says that\r\nthere old soger.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll--I'll----And what did you say, Sir?--for I suppose your tongue\r\nwas not idle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, me? I never let 'em know I was hearkening, or they'd have 'greed in\r\na moment for to give me a hiding. Besides, I had no need to cudgel my\r\nbrains; I'd only to ask you plump. You'll tell _me_, I know. Which is\r\nit, Mistress? I'm for Gaunt, you know, in course. Alack, Mistress,\"\r\ngabbled this voluble youth, \"sure you won't be so hard as sack my\r\nSquire, and him got a bullet in his carcass, for love of you, this day.\"\r\n\r\nKate started, and looked at him in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" said she, \"a bullet! Did they fight again the moment they saw my\r\nback was turned? The cowards!\"\r\n\r\nAnd she began to tremble.\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" said Tom; \"that was done before ever you came up. Don't ye\r\nremember that single shot while we were climbing the Nob? Well, 't was\r\nSquire Gaunt got it in the arm that time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\"\r\n\r\n\"But I say, wasn't our man game? Never let out he was hit while you was\r\nthere; but as soon as ever you was gone, they cut the bullet out of him,\r\nand I seen it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!--ah!\"\r\n\r\n\"Doctor takes out his knife,--precious sharp and shiny 't was!--cuts\r\ninto his arm with no more ado than if he was carving a pullet,--out\r\nsquirts the blood, a good un.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no more! no more! You cruel boy! how could you bear to look?\"\r\n\r\nAnd Kate hid her own face with both hands.\r\n\r\n\"Why, 't wasn't _my_ skin as was cut into Squire Gaunt, he never\r\nhollered; a winced, though, and ground his teeth; but 't was over in a\r\nminute, and the bullet in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"'That is for my wife,' says he, 'if ever I have one,'--and puts it in\r\nhis pocket.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Mistress, you be as white as your smock!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no! Did he faint, poor soul?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not he! What was there to faint about?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why do I feel so sick, even to hear of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because you ha'n't got no stomach,\" said the boy, contemptuously. \"Your\r\ncourage is skin-deep, I'm thinking. However, I'm glad you feel for our\r\nSquire, about the bullet; so now I hope you will wed with _him_, and\r\nsack Squire Neville. Then you and I shall be kind o' kin: Squire Gaunt's\r\nfeyther was my feyther. That makes you stare, Mistress. Why, all the\r\nfolk do know it. Look at this here little mole on my forehead. Squire\r\nGaunt have got the fellow to that.\"\r\n\r\nAt this crisis of his argument he suddenly caught a glimpse of his\r\npersonal interest; instantly he ceased his advocacy of Squire Gaunt, and\r\nbecame ludicrously impartial.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mistress; wed whichever you like,\" said he, with sublime\r\nindifference; \"only whichever you _do_ wed, prithee speak a word to the\r\ngentleman, and get me to be his gamekeeper. I'd liever be your goodman's\r\ngamekeeper than king of England.\"\r\n\r\nHe was proceeding with vast volubility to enumerate his qualifications\r\nfor that confidential post, when the lady cut him short, and told him to\r\ngo and get his supper in the kitchen, for she was wanted elsewhere. He\r\nmade a scrape, and clattered away with his hobnailed shoes.\r\n\r\nKate went to the hall window and opened it, and let the cold air blow\r\nover her face.\r\n\r\nHer heart was touched, and her bosom filled with pity for her old\r\nsweetheart.\r\n\r\nHow hard she had been. She had sided with Neville against the wounded\r\nman. And she thought how sadly and patiently he had submitted to her\r\ndecision,--and a bullet in his poor arm all the time.\r\n\r\nThe gentle bosom heaved, and heaved, and the tears began to run.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShe entered the dining-room timidly, expecting some comment on her\r\ndiscourteous absence. Instead of that, both her father and her director\r\nrose respectfully, and received her with kind and affectionate looks.\r\nThey then pressed her to eat this and that, and were remarkably\r\nattentive and kind. She could see that she was deep in their good books.\r\nThis pleased her; but she watched quietly, after the manner of her sex,\r\nto learn what it was all about. Nor was she left long in the dark.\r\nRemarks were made that hit her, though they were none of them addressed\r\nto her.\r\n\r\nFather Francis delivered quite a little homily on Obedience, and said\r\nhow happy a thing it was, when zeal, a virtue none too common in these\r\ndegenerate days, was found tempered by humility, and subservient to\r\nghostly counsel and authority.\r\n\r\nMr. Peyton dealt in no general topics of that kind; his discourse was\r\nsecular: it ran upon Neville's Cross, Neville's Court, and the\r\nBaronetcy; and he showed Francis how and why this title must sooner or\r\nlater come to George Neville and the heirs of his body.\r\n\r\nFrancis joined in this topic for a while, but speedily diverged into\r\nwhat might be called a collateral theme. He described to Kate a\r\ndelightful spot on the Neville estate, where a nunnery might be built\r\nand endowed by any good Catholic lady having zeal, and influence with\r\nthe owner of the estate, and with the lord-lieutenant of the county.\r\n\r\n\"It is three parts an island, (for the river Wey curls round it\r\nlovingly,) but backed by wooded slopes that keep off the north and east\r\nwinds: a hidden and balmy place, such as the forefathers of the Church\r\ndid use to choose for their rustic abbeys, whose ruins still survive to\r\nremind us of the pious and glorious days gone by. Trout and salmon come\r\nswimming to the door; hawthorn and woodbine are as rife there as weeds\r\nbe in some parts; two broad oaks stand on turf like velvet, and ring\r\nwith songbirds. A spot by nature sweet, calm, and holy,--good for pious\r\nexercises and heavenly contemplation: there, methinks, if it be God's\r\nwill I should see old age, I would love to end my own days, at peace\r\nwith Heaven and with all mankind.\"\r\n\r\nKate was much moved by this picture, and her clasped hands and\r\nglistening eyes showed the glory and delight it would be to her to build\r\na convent on so lovely a spot. But her words were vague. \"How sweet! how\r\nsweet!\" was all she committed herself to. For, after what Tom Leicester\r\nhad just told her, she hardly knew what to say or what to think or what\r\nto do; she felt she had become a mere puppet, first drawn one way, then\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nOne thing appeared pretty clear to her now: Father Francis did not mean\r\nher to choose between her two lovers; he was good enough to relieve her\r\nof that difficulty by choosing for her. She was to marry Neville.\r\n\r\nShe retired to rest directly after supper; for she was thoroughly worn\r\nout. And the moment she rose to go, her father bounced up, and lighted\r\nthe bed-candle for her with novel fervor, and kissed her on the cheek,\r\nand said in her ear,--\r\n\r\n\"Good night, my Lady Neville!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nWhat with the day's excitement, and a sweet secluded convent in her\r\nsoul, and a bullet in her bosom, and a ringing in her ear, that sounded\r\nmighty like \"Lady Neville! Lady Neville! Lady Neville!\" Kate spent a\r\nrestless night, and woke with a bad headache.\r\n\r\nShe sent her maid to excuse her, on this score, from going to Bolton\r\nHall. But she was informed, in reply, that the carriage had been got\r\nready expressly for her; so she must be good enough to shake off disease\r\nand go; the air would do her a deal more good than lying abed.\r\n\r\nThereupon she dressed herself in her black silk gown, and came down,\r\nlooking pale and languid, but still quite lovely enough to discharge\r\nwhat in this age of cant I suppose we should call \"her mission\":\r\n_videlicet_, to set honest men by the ears.\r\n\r\nAt half past eight o'clock the carriage came round to the front door.\r\nIts body, all glorious with the Peyton armorials and with patches of\r\nrusty gilding, swung exceedingly loose on long leathern straps instead\r\nof springs; and the fore-wheels were a mile from the hind-wheels, more\r\nor less. A pretentious and horrible engine; drawn by four horses; only\r\ntwo of them being ponies impaired the symmetry and majestic beauty of\r\nthe pageant. Old Joe drove the wheelers; his boy rode the leaders, and\r\nevery now and then got off and kicked them in the pits of their\r\nstomachs, or pierced them with hedge-stakes, to rouse their mettle. Thus\r\nencouraged and stimulated, they effected an average of four miles and a\r\nhalf per hour, notwithstanding the snow, and reached Bolton just in\r\ntime. At the lodge, Francis got out, and lay in ambush,--but only for a\r\ntime. He did not think it orthodox to be present at a religious ceremony\r\nof his Protestant friends,--nor common-sense-o-dox to turn his back upon\r\ntheir dinner.\r\n\r\nThe carriage drew up at the hall-door. It was wide open, and the hall\r\nlined with servants, male and female, in black. In the midst, between\r\nthese two rows, stood Griffith Gaunt, bareheaded, to welcome the guests.\r\nHis arm was in a sling. He had received all the others in the middle of\r\nthe hall; but he came to the threshold to meet Kate and her father. He\r\nbowed low and respectfully, then gave his left hand to Kate to conduct\r\nher, after the formal fashion of the day. The sight of his arm in a\r\nsling startled and affected her; and with him giving her his hand almost\r\nat the same moment, she pressed it, or indeed squeezed it nervously, and\r\nit was in her heart to say something kind and womanly: but her father\r\nwas close behind, and she was afraid of saying something too kind, if\r\nshe said anything at all; so Griffith only got a little gentle nervous\r\npinch. But that was more than he expected, and sent a thrill of delight\r\nthrough him; his brown eyes replied with a volume, and holding her hand\r\nup in the air as high as her ear, and keeping at an incredible distance,\r\nhe led her solemnly to a room where the other ladies were, and left her\r\nthere with a profound bow.\r\n\r\nThe Peytons were nearly the last persons expected; and soon after their\r\narrival the funeral procession formed. This part was entirely arranged\r\nby the undertaker. The monstrous custom of forbidding ladies to follow\r\ntheir dead had not yet occurred even to the idiots of the nation, and\r\nMr. Peyton and his daughter were placed in the second carriage. The\r\nfirst contained Griffith Gaunt alone, as head mourner. But the Peytons\r\nwere not alone: no other relation of the deceased being present, the\r\nundertaker put Mr. Neville with the Peytons, because he was heir to a\r\nbaronetcy.\r\n\r\nKate was much startled, and astonished to see him come out into the\r\nhall. But when he entered the carriage, she welcomed him warmly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I am so glad to see you here!\" said she.\r\n\r\n\"Guess by that what my delight at meeting you must be,\" said he.\r\n\r\nShe blushed and turned it off.\r\n\r\n\"I mean, that your coming here gives me good hopes there will be no more\r\nmischief.\"\r\n\r\nShe then lowered her voice, and begged him on no account to tell her\r\npapa of her ride to Scutchemsee Nob.\r\n\r\n\"Not a word,\" said George.\r\n\r\nHe knew the advantage of sharing a secret with a fair lady. He proceeded\r\nto whisper something very warm in her ear: she listened to some of it;\r\nbut then remonstrated, and said,--\r\n\r\n\"Are you not ashamed to go on so at a funeral? Oh, do, pray, leave\r\ncompliments a moment, and think of your latter end.\"\r\n\r\nHe took this suggestion, as indeed he did everything from her, in good\r\npart; and composed his visage into a decent gravity.\r\n\r\nSoon after this they reached the church, and buried the deceased in his\r\nfamily vault.\r\n\r\nPeople who are not bereaved by the death are always inclined to chatter,\r\ncoming home from a funeral. Kate now talked to Neville of her own\r\naccord, and asked him if he had spoken to his host. He said yes, and,\r\nmore than that, had come to a clear understanding with him.\r\n\r\n\"We agreed that it was no use fighting for you. I said, if either of us\r\ntwo was to kill the other, it did not follow you would wed the\r\nsurvivor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Me wed the wretch!\" said Kate, \"I should abhor him, and go into a\r\nconvent in spite of you all, and end my days praying for the murdered\r\nman's soul.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither of us is worth all that,\" suggested Neville, with an accent of\r\nconviction.\r\n\r\n\"That is certain,\" replied the lady, dryly; \"so please not to do it.\"\r\n\r\nHe bade her set her mind at ease: they had both agreed to try and win\r\nher by peaceful arts.\r\n\r\n\"Then a pretty life mine will be!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I think it will, till you decide.\"\r\n\r\n\"I could easily decide, if it were not for giving pain to--somebody.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you can't help that. My sweet mistress, you are not the first that\r\nhas had to choose between two worthy men. For, in sooth, I have nothing\r\nto say against my rival, neither. I know him better than I did: he is a\r\nvery worthy gentleman, though he is damnably in my way.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you are a very noble one to say so.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you are one of those that make a man noble: I feel that petty arts\r\nare not the way to win you, and I scorn them. Sweet Mistress Kate, I\r\nadore you! You are the best and noblest, as well as the loveliest of\r\nwomen!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, hush, Mr. Neville! I am a creature of clay,--and you are\r\nanother,--and both of us coming home from a funeral. Do think of\r\n_that_.\"\r\n\r\nHere they were interrupted by Mr. Peyton asking Kate to lend him a\r\nshilling for the groom. Kate replied aloud that she had left her purse\r\nat home, then whispered in his ear that she had not a shilling in the\r\nworld: and this was strictly true; for her little all was Tom\r\nLeicester's now. With this they reached the Hall, and the coy Kate gave\r\nboth Neville and Gaunt the slip, and got amongst her mates. There her\r\ntongue went as fast as her neighbors', though she had just come back\r\nfrom a funeral.\r\n\r\nBut soon the ladies and gentlemen were all invited to the reading of the\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nAnd now chance, which had hitherto befriended Neville by throwing him\r\ninto one carriage with Kate, gave Gaunt a turn. He found her a moment\r\nalone and near the embrasure of a window. He seized the opportunity, and\r\nasked her, might he say a word in her ear?\r\n\r\n\"What a question!\" said she, gayly; and the next moment they had the\r\nembrasure to themselves.\r\n\r\n\"Kate,\" said he, hurriedly, \"in a few minutes, I suppose, I shall be\r\nmaster of this place. Now you told me once you would rather be an abbess\r\nor a nun than marry me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did I?\" said Kate. \"What a sensible speech! But the worst of it is, I'm\r\nnever in the same mind long.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" replied Griffith, \"I think of all that falls from your lips, and\r\nyour will is mine; only for pity's sake do not wed any man but me. You\r\nhave known me so long; why, you know the worst of me by this time; and\r\nyou have only seen the outside of _him_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Detraction! is that what you wanted to say to me?\" asked Kate, freezing\r\nsuddenly.\r\n\r\n\"Nay, nay; it was about the abbey. I find you can be an abbess without\r\ngoing and shutting yourself up and breaking one's heart. The way is, you\r\nbuild a convent in Ireland, and endow it; and then you send a nun over\r\nto govern it under you. Bless your heart, you can do anything with\r\nmoney; and I shall have money enough before the day is over. To be sure,\r\nI _did_ intend to build a kennel and keep harriers, and you know that\r\ncosts a good penny: but we couldn't manage a kennel and an abbey too; so\r\nnow down goes the English kennel, and up goes the Irish abbey.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you are a Protestant gentleman. You could not found a nunnery.\"\r\n\r\n\"But my wife could. Whose business is it what she does with her money?\"\r\n\r\n\"With your money, you mean.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, with hers, when I give it her with all my heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you astonish me,\" said Kate, thoughtfully. \"Tell me, now, who put\r\nit into your head to bribe a poor girl in this abominable way?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who put it in my head?\" said Griffith, looking rather puzzled; \"why, I\r\nsuppose my heart put it in my head.\"\r\n\r\nKate smiled very sweetly at this answer, and a wild hope thrilled\r\nthrough Griffith that perhaps she might be brought to terms.\r\n\r\nBut at this crisis the lawyer from London was announced, and Griffith,\r\nas master of the house, was obliged to seat the company. He looked\r\nbitterly disappointed at the interruption, but put a good face on it,\r\nand had more chairs in, and saw them all seated, beginning with Kate and\r\nthe other ladies.\r\n\r\nThe room was spacious, and the entire company sat in the form of a\r\nhorse-shoe.\r\n\r\nThe London solicitor was introduced by Griffith, and bowed in a short,\r\nbusiness-like way, seated himself in the horse-shoe aforesaid, and began\r\nto read the will aloud.\r\n\r\nIt was a lengthy document, and there is nothing to be gained by\r\nrepeating every line of it. I pick out a clause here and there.\r\n\r\n\"I, Septimus Charlton, of Hernshaw Castle and Bolton Grange, in the\r\nCounty of Cumberland, Esquire, being of sound mind, memory, and\r\nunderstanding,--thanks be to God,--do make this my last will and\r\ntestament, as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"First, I commit my soul to God who gave it, and my body to the earth\r\nfrom which it came. I desire my executors to discharge my funeral and\r\ntestamentary expenses, my just debts, and the legacies hereinafter\r\nbequeathed, out of my personal estate.\"\r\n\r\nThen followed several legacies of fifty and one hundred guineas; then\r\nseveral small legacies, such as the following:--\r\n\r\n\"To my friend Edward Peyton, of Peyton Hall, Esquire, ten guineas to buy\r\na mourning ring.\r\n\r\n\"To the worshipful gentlemen and ladies who shall follow my body to the\r\ngrave, ten guineas each, to buy a mourning ring.\"\r\n\r\n\"To my wife's cousin, Griffith Gaunt, I give and bequeath the sum of two\r\nthousand pounds, the same to be paid to him within one calendar month\r\nfrom the date of my decease.\r\n\r\n\"And as to all my messuages, or tenements, farms, lands, hereditaments,\r\nand real estate, of what nature or what kind soever, and wheresoever\r\nsituate, together with all my moneys, mortgages, chattels, furniture,\r\nplate, pictures, wine, liquors, horses, carriages, stock, and all the\r\nrest, residue, and remainder of my personal estate and effects\r\nwhatsoever, (after the payment of the debts and legacies hereinbefore\r\nmentioned,) I give, devise, and bequeath the same to my cousin,\r\nCatharine Peyton, daughter of Edward Peyton, Esquire, of Peyton Hall, in\r\nthe County of Cumberland, her heirs, executors, administrators, and\r\nassigns, forever.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen the lawyer read out this unexpected blow, the whole company turned\r\nin their seats and looked amazed at her who in a second and a sentence\r\nwas turned before their eyes from the poorest girl in Cumberland to an\r\nheiress in her own right, and proprietor of the house they sat in, the\r\nchairs they sat on, and the lawn they looked out at.\r\n\r\nAy, we turn to the rising sun. Very few looked at Griffith Gaunt to see\r\nhow he took his mistress's good fortune, that was his calamity; yet his\r\nface was a book full of strange matter. At first a flash of loving joy\r\ncrossed his countenance; but this gave way immediately to a haggard\r\nlook, and that to a glare of despair.\r\n\r\nAs for the lady, she cast one deprecating glance, swifter than\r\nlightning, at him she had disinherited, and then she turned her face to\r\nmarble. In vain did curious looks explore her to detect the delight such\r\na stroke of fortune would have given to themselves. Faulty, but great of\r\nsoul, and on her guard against the piercing eyes of her own sex, she sat\r\nsedate, and received her change of fortune with every appearance of cool\r\ncomposure and exalted indifference; and as for her dreamy eyes, they\r\nseemed thinking of heaven, or something almost as many miles away from\r\nmoney and land.\r\n\r\nBut the lawyer had not stopped a moment to see how people took it; he\r\nhad gone steadily on through the usual formal clauses; and now he\r\nbrought his monotonous voice to an end, and added, in the same breath,\r\nbut in a natural and cheerful tone,--\r\n\r\n\"Madam, I wish you joy.\"\r\n\r\nThis operated like a signal. The company exploded in a body; and then\r\nthey all came about the heiress, and congratulated her in turn. She\r\ncurtsied politely, though somewhat coldly, but said not a word in reply,\r\ntill the disappointed one spoke to her.\r\n\r\nHe hung back at first. To understand his feelings, it must be\r\nremembered, that, in his view of things, Kate gained nothing by this\r\nbequest, compared with what he lost. As his wife, she would have been\r\nmistress of Bolton Hall, etc. But now she was placed too far above him.\r\nSick at heart, he stood aloof while they all paid their court to her.\r\nBut by-and-by he felt it would look base and hostile, if he alone said\r\nnothing; so he came forward, struggling visibly for composure and manly\r\nfortitude.\r\n\r\nThe situation was piquant; and the ladies' tongues stopped in a moment,\r\nand they were all eyes and ears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHREE MONTHS AMONG THE RECONSTRUCTIONISTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI spent the months of September, October, and November, 1865, in the\r\nStates of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. I travelled over\r\nmore than half the stage and railway routes therein, visited a\r\nconsiderable number of towns and cities in each State, attended the\r\nso-called reconstruction conventions at Raleigh, Columbia, and\r\nMilledgeville, and had much conversation with many individuals of nearly\r\nall classes.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nI was generally treated with civility, and occasionally with courteous\r\ncordiality. I judge, from the stories told me by various persons, that\r\nmy reception was, on the whole, something better than that accorded to\r\nthe majority of Northern men travelling in that section. Yet at one town\r\nin South Carolina, when I sought accommodations for two or three days at\r\na boarding-house, I was asked by the woman in charge, \"Are you a Yankee\r\nor a Southerner?\" and when I answered, \"Oh, a Yankee, of course,\" she\r\nresponded, \"No Yankee stops in this house!\" and turned her back upon me\r\nand walked off. In another town in the same State I learned that I was\r\nthe first Yankee who had been allowed to stop at the hotel since the\r\nclose of the war. In one of the principal towns of Western North\r\nCarolina, the landlord of the hotel said to a customer, while he was\r\nsettling his bill, that he would be glad to have him say a good word for\r\nthe house to any of his friends; \"but,\" added he, \"you may tell all\r\nd----d Yankees I can git 'long jest as well, if they keep clar o' me\";\r\nand when I asked if the Yankees were poor pay, or made him extra\r\ntrouble, he answered, \"I don't want 'em 'round. I ha'n't got no use for\r\n'em nohow.\" In another town in the same State, a landlord said to me,\r\nwhen I paid my two-days' bill, that \"no d--n Yankee\" could have a bed in\r\nhis house. In Georgia, I several times heard the people of my hotel\r\nexpressing the hope that the passenger-train wouldn't bring any Yankees;\r\nand I have good reason for believing that I was quite often compelled to\r\npay an extra price for accommodations because I was known to be from the\r\nNorth. In one town, several of us, passengers by an evening train, were\r\nsolicited to go to a certain hotel; but the clerk declined to give me a\r\nroom, when he learned that I was from Massachusetts, though I secured\r\none after a time through the favor of a travelling acquaintance, who\r\nsharply rebuked the landlord.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be said that freedom of speech has been fully secured in\r\neither of these three States. Personally, I have very little cause of\r\ncomplaint, for my _role_ was rather that of a listener than of a talker;\r\nbut I met many persons who kindly cautioned me, that at such and such\r\nplaces, and in such and such company, it would be advisable to refrain\r\nfrom conversation on certain topics. Among the better class of people,\r\nresident in the cities and large towns, I found a fair degree of\r\nliberality of sentiment and courtesy of speech; but in travelling off\r\nthe main railway-lines, and among the average of the population, any man\r\nof Northern opinions must use much circumspection of language; while, in\r\nmany counties of South Carolina and Georgia, the life of an avowed\r\nNorthern radical would hardly be worth a straw but for the presence of\r\nthe military. In Barnwell and Anderson districts, South Carolina,\r\nofficial records show the murder of over a dozen Union men in the months\r\nof August and September; and at Atlanta, a man told me, with a quiet\r\nchuckle, that in Carroll County, Georgia, there were \"four d--n Yankees\r\nshot in the month of October.\" Any Union man, travelling in either of\r\nthese two States, must expect to hear many very insulting words; and any\r\nNorthern man is sure to find his principles despised, his people\r\ncontemned, and himself subjected to much disagreeable contumely. There\r\nis everywhere extreme sensitiveness concerning the negro and his\r\nrelations; and I neither found nor learned of any village, town, or city\r\nin which it would be safe for a man to express freely what are here, in\r\nthe North, called very moderate views on that subject. Of course the war\r\nhas not taught its full lesson, till even Mr. Wendell Phillips can go\r\ninto Georgia and proclaim \"The South Victorious.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nI often had occasion to notice, both in Georgia and the Carolinas, the\r\nwide and pitiful difference between the residents of the cities and\r\nlarge towns and the residents of the country. There is no homogeneity,\r\nbut everywhere a rigid spirit of caste. The longings of South Carolina\r\nare essentially monarchical rather than republican; even the common\r\npeople have become so debauched in loyalty, that very many of them would\r\nreadily accept the creation of orders of nobility. In Georgia there is\r\nsomething less of this spirit; but the upper classes continually assert\r\ntheir right to rule, and the middle and lower classes have no ability to\r\nfree themselves. The whole structure of society is full of separating\r\nwalls; and it will sadden the heart of any Northern man, who travels in\r\neither of these three States, to see how poor, and meagre, and narrow a\r\nthing life is to all the country people. Even with the best class of\r\ntownsfolk it lacks very much of the depth and breadth and fruitfulness\r\nof our Northern life, while with these others it is hardly less\r\nmaterialistic than that of their own mules and horses. Thus, Charleston\r\nhas much intelligence, and considerable genuine culture; but go twenty\r\nmiles away, and you are in the land of the barbarians. So, Raleigh is a\r\ncity in which there is love of beauty, and interest in education; but\r\nthe common people of the county are at least forty years behind the same\r\nclass of people in Vermont. Moreover, in Macon are many very fine\r\nresidences, and the city may boast of its gentility and its respect for\r\nthe nourishing elegancies of life; but a dozen miles out are large\r\nneighborhoods not yet half-civilized. The contrast between the\r\ninhabitants of the cities and those of the country is hardly less\r\nstriking than that between the various classes constituting the body of\r\nthe common people. Going from one county into another is frequently\r\ngoing into a foreign country. Travel continually brings novelty, but\r\nwith that always came pain. Till all these hateful walls of caste are\r\nthrown down, we can have neither intelligent love of liberty, decent\r\nrespect for justice, nor enlightened devotion to the idea of national\r\nunity. \"Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?\"\r\n\r\nIt has been the purpose of the ruling class, apparently, to build new\r\nbarriers between themselves and the common people, rather than tear away\r\nany of those already existing. I think no one can understand the actual\r\ncondition of the mass of whites in Georgia and the Carolinas, except by\r\nsome daily contact with them. The injustice done to three fourths of\r\nthem was hardly less than that done to all the blacks. There were two\r\nkinds of slavery, and negro slavery was only more wicked and debasing\r\nthan white slavery. Nine of every ten white men in South Carolina had\r\nalmost as little to do with even State affairs as the negroes had. Men\r\ntalk of plans of reconstruction;--that is the best plan which proposes\r\nto do most for the common people. Till civilization has been carried\r\ndown into the homes and hearts of all classes, we shall have neither\r\nregard for humanity nor respect for the rights of the citizen. In many\r\nsections of all these States human life is quite as cheap as animal\r\nlife. What a mental and moral condition does this indicate! Any plan of\r\nreconstruction is wrong that does not assure toleration of opinion, and\r\nthe elevation of the common people to the consciousness that ours is a\r\nrepublican form of government. Whether they are technically in the Union\r\nor out of the Union, it is the national duty to deal with these States\r\nin such manner as will most surely exalt the lower and middle classes of\r\ntheir inhabitants. The nation must teach them a knowledge of their own\r\nrights, while it also teaches them respect for its rights and the rights\r\nof man as man.\r\n\r\nStopping for two or three days in some back county, I was always seeming\r\nto have drifted away from the world which held Illinois and Ohio and\r\nMassachusetts. The difficulty in keeping connection with our\r\ncivilization did not so much lie in the fact that the whole structure of\r\ndaily life is unlike ours, nor in the other fact that I was forced to\r\nhear the Union and all loyal men reviled, as in the greater fact that\r\nthe people are utterly without knowledge. There is everywhere a lack of\r\nintellectual activity. Schools, books, newspapers,--why, one may almost\r\nsay there are none outside the cities and towns. The situation is\r\nhorrible enough, when the full force of this fact is comprehended; yet\r\nthere is a still lower deep,--there is small desire, even feeble\r\nlonging, for schools and books and newspapers. The chief end of man\r\nseems to have been \"to own a nigger.\" In the important town of\r\nCharlotte, North Carolina, I found a white man who owned the comfortable\r\nhouse in which he lived, who had a wife and three half-grown children,\r\nand yet had never taken a newspaper in his life. He thought they were\r\nhandy for wrapping purposes, but he couldn't see why anybody wanted to\r\nbother with the reading of them. He knew some folks spent money for\r\nthem, but he also knew a-many houses where none had ever been seen. In\r\nthat State I found several persons--whites, and not of the \"clay-eater\"\r\nclass, either--who never had been inside a school-house, and who didn't\r\nmean to 'low their children to go inside one. In the upper part of South\r\nCarolina, I stopped one night at the house of a moderately well-to-do\r\nfarmer who never had owned any book but a Testament, and that was given\r\nto him. When I expressed some surprise at this fact, he assured me that\r\nhe was as well off as some other people thereabouts. Between Augusta and\r\nMilledgeville I rode in a stage-coach in which were two delegates of the\r\nGeorgia Convention. When I said that I hoped the day would soon come in\r\nwhich school-houses would be as numerous in Georgia as in Massachusetts,\r\none of them answered: \"Well, I hope it'll never come,--popular education\r\nis all a d--n humbug in my judgment\"; whereunto the other responded,\r\n\"That's my opinion, too.\" These are exceptional cases, I am aware, but\r\nthey truly index the situation of thousands of persons. It is this\r\ngeneral ignorance, and this general indifference to knowledge, that make\r\na Southern trip such wearisome work. You can touch the masses with few\r\nof the appeals by which we move our own people. There is very little\r\naspiration for larger life; and, more than that, there is almost no\r\nopportunity for its attainment. That education is the stairway to a\r\nnobler existence is a fact which they either fail to comprehend or to\r\nwhich they are wholly indifferent.\r\n\r\nWhere there is such a spirit of caste, where the ruling class has a\r\npersonal interest in fostering prejudice, where the masses are in such\r\nan inert condition, where ignorance so generally prevails, where there\r\nis so little ambition for improvement, where life is so hard and\r\nmaterial in its tone, it is not strange to find much hatred and\r\ncontempt. Ignorance is generally cruel, and frequently brutal. The\r\npolitical leaders of this people have apparently indoctrinated them with\r\nthe notion that they are superior to any other class in the country.\r\nHence there is usually very little effort to conceal the prevalent scorn\r\nof the Yankee,--this term being applied to the citizen of any Northern\r\nState. Any plan of reconstruction is wrong that tends to leave these old\r\nleaders in power. A few of them give fruitful evidence of a change of\r\nheart,--by some means save these for the sore and troubled future; but\r\nfor the others, the men who not only brought on the war, but ruined the\r\nmental and moral force of their people before unfurling the banner of\r\nrebellion,--for these there should never any more be place or\r\ncountenance among honest and humane and patriotic people. When the\r\nnation gives them life, and a chance for its continuance, it shows all\r\nthe magnanimity that humanity in such case can afford.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nIn North Carolina there is a great deal of something that calls itself\r\nUnionism; but I know nothing more like the apples of Sodom than most of\r\nthis North Carolina Unionism. It is a cheat, a Will-o'-the-wisp; and any\r\nman who trusts it will meet with overthrow. Its quality is shown in a\r\nhundred ways. An old farmer came into Raleigh to sell a little corn. I\r\nhad some talk with him. He claimed that he had been a Union man from the\r\nbeginning of the war, but he refused to take \"greenback money\" for his\r\ncorn. In a town in the western part of the State I found a merchant who\r\nprided himself on the fact that he had always prophesied the downfall of\r\nthe so-called Confederacy and had always desired the success of the\r\nUnion arms; yet when I asked him why he did not vote in the election for\r\ndelegates to the Convention, he answered, sneeringly--\"I shall not vote\r\ntill you take away the military.\" The State Convention declared by a\r\nvote of ninety-four to nineteen that the Secession ordinance had always\r\nbeen null and void; and then faced squarely about, and, before the\r\nPresidential instructions were received, impliedly declared, by a vote\r\nof fifty-seven to fifty-three, in favor of paying the war debt incurred\r\nin supporting that ordinance! This action on these two points exactly\r\nexemplifies the quality of North Carolina Unionism. There may be in it\r\nthe seed of loyalty, but woe to him who mistakes the germ for the\r\nripened fruit! In all sections of the State I found abundant hatred of\r\nsome leading or local Secessionist; but how full of promise for the new\r\nera of national life is the Unionism which rests only on this\r\nfoundation?\r\n\r\nIn South Carolina there is very little pretence of loyalty. I believe I\r\nfound less than fifty men who admitted any love for the Union. There is\r\neverywhere a passionate devotion to the State, and the common sentiment\r\nholds that man guilty of treason who prefers the United States to South\r\nCarolina. There is no occasion to wonder at the admiration of the people\r\nfor Wade Hampton, for he is the very exemplar of their spirit,--of their\r\nproud and narrow and domineering spirit. \"It is our duty,\" he says, in\r\nhis letter of last November, \"_it is our duty to support the President\r\nof the United States so long as he manifests a disposition to restore\r\nall our rights as a sovereign State._\" That sentence will forever stand\r\nas a model of cool arrogance, and yet it is in full accord with the\r\nspirit of the South-Carolinians. He continues:--\"Above all, let us stand\r\nby our State,--all the sacred ties that bind us to her are intensified\r\nby her suffering and desolation.... It only remains for me, in bidding\r\nyou farewell, to say, that, whenever the State needs my services, she\r\nhas only to command, and I shall obey.\" The war has taught this people\r\nonly that the physical force of the nation cannot be resisted. They will\r\nbe obedient to the letter of the law, perhaps, but the whole current of\r\ntheir lives flows in direct antagonism to its spirit.\r\n\r\nIn Georgia there is something worse than sham Unionism or cold\r\nacquiescence in the issue of battle: it is the universally prevalent\r\ndoctrine of the supremacy of the State. Even in South Carolina a few men\r\nstood up against the storm, and now claim credit for faith in dark days.\r\nIn Georgia that man is hopelessly dead who doubted or faltered. The\r\ncommon sense of all classes pushes the necessity of allegiance to the\r\nState into the domain of morals as well as into that of politics; and he\r\nwho did not \"go with the State\" in the Rebellion is held to have\r\ncommitted the unpardonable sin. At Macon I met a man who was one of the\r\nleading Unionists in the winter of 1860-61. He told me how he suffered\r\nthen for his hostility to Secession, and yet he added,--\"I should have\r\nconsidered myself forever disgraced, if I hadn't heartily gone with the\r\nState, when she decided to fight.\" And Ben Hill, than whom there are but\r\nfew more influential men in the State, advises the people after this\r\nfashion,--\"I would vote for no man who could take the Congressional\r\ntest-oath, because it is the highest evidence of infidelity to the\r\npeople of the State.\" I believe it is the concurrent testimony of all\r\ncareful travellers in Georgia, that there is everywhere only cold\r\ntoleration for the idea of national sovereignty, very little hope for\r\nthe future of the State as a member of the Federal Union, and scarcely\r\nany pride in the strength and glory and renown of the United States of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nMuch is said of the hypocrisy of the South. I found but little of it\r\nanywhere. The North-Carolinian calls himself a Unionist, but he makes no\r\nspecial pretence of love for the Union. He desires many favors, but he\r\nasks them generally on the ground that he hated the Secessionists. He\r\nexpects the nation to recognize rare virtue in that hatred, and hopes it\r\nmay win for his State the restoration of her political rights; but he\r\nwears his mask of nationality so lightly that there is no difficulty in\r\nremoving it. The South-Carolinian demands only something less than he\r\ndid in the days before the war, but he offers no plea of Unionism as a\r\nguaranty for the future. He rests his case on the assumption that he has\r\nfully acquiesced in the results of the war, and he honestly believes\r\nthat he has so acquiesced. His confidence in South Carolina is so\r\nsupreme that he fails to see how much the conflict meant. He walks by\r\nsuch light as he has, and cannot yet believe that Destiny has decreed\r\nhis State a secondary place in the Union. The Georgian began by\r\nbelieving that rebellion in the interest of Slavery was honorable, and\r\nthe result of the war has not changed his opinion. He is anxious for\r\nreadmission to fellowship with New York and Pennsylvania and\r\nConnecticut, but he supports his application by no claim of community of\r\ninterest with other States. His spirit is hard and uncompromising; he\r\ndemands rights, but does not ask favors; and he is confident that\r\nGeorgia is fully as important to the United States as they are to\r\nGeorgia.\r\n\r\nComplaint is made that the Southern people have recently elected\r\nmilitary men to most of their local State offices. We do ourselves a\r\nwrong in making this complaint. I found it almost everywhere true in\r\nGeorgia and the Carolinas that the best citizens of to-day are the\r\nConfederate soldiers of yesterday. Of course, in many individual cases\r\nthey are bitter and malignant; but in general the good of the Union, no\r\nless than the hope of the South, lies in the bearing of the men who were\r\nprivates and minor officers in the armies of Lee and Johnston. It may\r\nnot be pleasant to us to recognize this fact; but I am confident that we\r\nshall make sure progress toward securing domestic tranquillity and the\r\ngeneral welfare, just in proportion as we act upon it. It should be kept\r\nin mind that comparatively few of those who won renown on the field were\r\npromoters of rebellion or secession. The original malcontents,--ah!\r\nwhere are they? Some of them at least are beyond interference in earthly\r\naffairs; others are in hopeless poverty and chilling neglect; others are\r\nstruggling to mount once more the wave of popular favor. A few of these\r\nlast have been successful,--to see that no more of them are so is a\r\nnational duty. I count it an omen of good, when I find that one who bore\r\nhimself gallantly as a soldier has received preferment. We cannot afford\r\nto quarrel on this ground; for, though their courage was for our\r\nwounding, their valor was the valor of Americans.\r\n\r\nThe really bad feature of the situation with respect to the relations of\r\nthese States to the General Government is, that there is not only very\r\nlittle loyalty in their people, but a great deal of stubborn antagonism,\r\nand some deliberate defiance. Further war in the field I do not deem\r\namong the possibilities. Be the leaders never so bloodthirsty, the\r\ncommon people have had enough of fighting. The bastard Unionism of North\r\nCarolina, the haughty and self-complacent State pride of South Carolina,\r\nthe arrogant dogmatism and insolent assumption of Georgia,--how shall we\r\nbuild nationality on such foundations? That is the true plan of\r\nreconstruction which makes haste very slowly. It does not comport with\r\nthe character of our Government to exact pledges of any State which are\r\nnot exacted of all. The one sole needful condition is, that each State\r\nestablish a republican form of government, whereby all civil rights at\r\nleast shall be assured in their fullest extent to every citizen. The\r\nUnion is no Union, unless there is equality of privileges among the\r\nStates. When Georgia and the Carolinas establish this republican form of\r\ngovernment, they will have brought themselves into harmony with the\r\nnational will, and may justly demand readmission to their former\r\npolitical relations in the Union. Each State has some citizens, who,\r\nwiser than the great majority, comprehend the meaning of Southern defeat\r\nwith praiseworthy insight. Seeing only individuals of this small class,\r\na traveller might honestly conclude that the States were ready for\r\nself-government. Let not the nation commit the terrible mistake of\r\nacting on this conclusion. These men are the little leaven in the gross\r\nbody politic of Southern communities. It is no time for passion or\r\nbitterness, and it does not become our manhood to do anything for\r\nrevenge. Let us have peace and kindly feeling; yet, that our peace may\r\nbe no sham or shallow affair, it is painfully essential that we keep\r\nthese States awhile within national control, in order to aid the few\r\nwise and just men therein who are fighting the great fight with stubborn\r\nprejudice and hidebound custom. Any plan of reconstruction is wrong\r\nwhich accepts forced submission as genuine loyalty, or even as cheerful\r\nacquiescence in the national desire and purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nBefore the war, we heard continually of the love of the master for his\r\nslave, and the love of the slave for his master. There was also much\r\ntalk to the effect that the negro lived in the midst of pleasant\r\nsurroundings, and had no desire to change his situation. It was asserted\r\nthat he delighted in a state of dependence, and throve on the universal\r\nfavor of the whites. Some of this language we conjectured might be\r\nextravagant; but to the single fact that there was universal good-will\r\nbetween the two classes every Southern white person bore evidence. So,\r\ntoo, in my late visit to Georgia and the Carolinas, they generally\r\nseemed anxious to convince me that the blacks had behaved well during\r\nthe war,--had kept at their old tasks, had labored cheerfully and\r\nfaithfully, had shown no disposition to lawlessness, and had rarely been\r\nguilty of acts of violence, even in sections where there were many women\r\nand children, and but few white men.\r\n\r\nYet I found everywhere now the most direct antagonism between the two\r\nclasses. The whites charge generally that the negro is idle, and at the\r\nbottom of all local disturbances, and credit him with most of the vices\r\nand very few of the virtues of humanity. The negroes charge that the\r\nwhites are revengeful, and intend to cheat the laboring class at every\r\nopportunity, and credit them with neither good purposes nor kindly\r\nhearts. This present and positive hostility of each class to the other\r\nis a fact that will sorely perplex any Northern man travelling in either\r\nof these States. One would say, that, if there had formerly been such\r\npleasant relations between them, there ought now to be mutual sympathy\r\nand forbearance, instead of mutual distrust and antagonism. One would\r\nsay, too, that self-interest, the common interest of capital and labor,\r\nought to keep them in harmony; while the fact is, that this very\r\ninterest appears to put them in an attitude of partial defiance toward\r\neach other. I believe the most charitable traveller must come to the\r\nconclusion, that the professed love of the whites for the blacks was\r\nmostly a monstrous sham or a downright false pretence. For myself, I\r\njudge that it was nothing less than an arrant humbug.\r\n\r\nThe negro is no model of virtue or manliness. He loves idleness, he has\r\nlittle conception of right and wrong, and he is improvident to the last\r\ndegree of childishness. He is a creature,--as some of our own people\r\nwill do well to keep carefully in mind,--he is a creature just forcibly\r\nreleased from slavery. The havoc of war has filled his heart with\r\nconfused longings, and his ears with confused sounds of rights and\r\nprivileges: it must be the nation's duty, for it cannot be left wholly\r\nto his late master, to help him to a clear understanding of these rights\r\nand privileges, and also to lay upon him a knowledge of his\r\nresponsibilities. He is anxious to learn, and is very tractable in\r\nrespect to minor matters; but we shall need almost infinite patience\r\nwith him, for he comes very slowly to moral comprehensions.\r\n\r\nGoing into the States where I went,--and perhaps the fact is true also\r\nof the other Southern States,--going into Georgia and the Carolinas, and\r\nnot keeping in mind the facts of yesterday, any man would almost be\r\njustified in concluding that the end and purpose in respect to this poor\r\nnegro was his extermination. It is proclaimed everywhere that he will\r\nnot work, that he cannot take care of himself, that he is a nuisance to\r\nsociety, that he lives by stealing, and that he is sure to die in a few\r\nmonths; and, truth to tell, the great body of the people, though one\r\nmust not say intentionally, are doing all they well can to make these\r\nassertions true. If it is not said that any considerable number wantonly\r\nabuse and outrage him, it must be said that they manifest a barbarous\r\nindifference to his fate, which just as surely drives him on to\r\ndestruction as open cruelty would.\r\n\r\nThere are some men and a few women--and perhaps the number of these is\r\ngreater than we of the North generally suppose--who really desire that\r\nthe negro should now have his full rights as a human being. With the\r\nsame proportion of this class of persons in a community of Northern\r\nconstitution, it might be justly concluded that the whole community\r\nwould soon join or acquiesce in the effort to secure for him at least a\r\nfair share of those rights. Unfortunately, however, in these Southern\r\ncommunities the opinion of such persons cannot have such weight as it\r\nwould in ours. The spirit of caste, of which I have already spoken, is\r\nan element figuring largely against them in any contest involving\r\nprinciple,--an element of whose practical workings we here know very\r\nlittle. The walls between individuals and classes are so high and broad,\r\nthat the men and women who recognize the negro's rights and privileges\r\nas a freeman are almost as far from the masses as we of the North are.\r\nMoreover, that any opinion savors of the \"Yankee\"--in other words, is\r\nnew to the South--is a fact that even prevents its consideration by the\r\ngreat body of the people. Their inherent antagonism to everything from\r\nthe North--an antagonism fostered and cunningly cultivated for half a\r\ncentury by the politicians in the interest of Slavery--is something that\r\nno traveller can photograph, that no Northern man can understand, till\r\nhe sees it with his own eyes, hears it with his own ears, and feels it\r\nby his own consciousness. That the full freedom of the negroes would be\r\nacknowledged at once is something we had no warrant for expecting. The\r\nold masters grant them nothing, except at the requirement of the\r\nnation,--as a military and political necessity; and any plan of\r\nreconstruction is wrong which proposes at once or in the immediate\r\nfuture to substitute free-will for this necessity.\r\n\r\nThree fourths of the people assume that the negro will not labor, except\r\non compulsion; and the whole struggle between the whites on the one hand\r\nand the blacks on the other hand is a struggle for and against\r\ncompulsion. The negro insists, very blindly perhaps, that he shall be\r\nfree to come and go as he pleases; the white insists that he shall come\r\nand go only at the pleasure of his employer. The whites seem wholly\r\nunable to comprehend that freedom for the negro means the same thing as\r\nfreedom for them. They readily enough admit that the Government has made\r\nhim free, but appear to believe that they still have the right to\r\nexercise over him the old control. It is partly their misfortune, and\r\nnot wholly their fault, that they cannot understand the national intent,\r\nas expressed in the Emancipation Proclamation and the Constitutional\r\nAmendment. I did not anywhere find a man who could see that laws should\r\nbe applicable to all persons alike; and hence even the best men hold\r\nthat each State must have a negro code. They acknowledge the overthrow\r\nof the special servitude of man to man, but seek through these codes to\r\nestablish the general servitude of man to the commonwealth. I had much\r\ntalk with intelligent gentlemen in various sections, and particularly\r\nwith such as I met during the conventions at Columbia and Milledgeville,\r\nupon this subject, and found such a state of feeling as warrants little\r\nhope that the present generation of negroes will see the day in which\r\ntheir race shall be amenable only to such laws as apply to the whites.\r\n\r\nI think the freedmen divide themselves into four classes: one fourth\r\nrecognizing; very clearly, the necessity of work, and going about it\r\nwith cheerful diligence and wise forethought; one fourth comprehending\r\nthat there must be labor, but needing considerable encouragement to\r\nfollow it steadily; one fourth preferring idleness, but not specially\r\naverse to doing some job-work about the towns and cities; and one fourth\r\navoiding labor as much as possible, and living by voluntary charity,\r\npersistent begging, or systematic pilfering. It is true, that thousands\r\nof the aggregate body of this people appear to have hoped, and perhaps\r\nbelieved, that freedom meant idleness; true, too, that thousands are\r\ndrifting about the country or loafing about the centres of population in\r\na state of vagabondage. Yet of the hundreds with whom I talked, I found\r\nless than a score who seemed beyond hope of reformation. It is a cruel\r\nslander to say that the race will not work, except on compulsion. I made\r\nmuch inquiry, wherever I went, of great numbers of planters and other\r\nemployers, and found but very few cases in which it appeared that they\r\nhad refused to labor reasonably well, when fairly treated and justly\r\npaid. Grudgingly admitted to any of the natural rights of man, despised\r\nalike by Unionists and Secessionists, wantonly outraged by many and\r\nmeanly cheated by more of the old planters, receiving a hundred cuffs\r\nfor one helping hand and a thousand curses for one kindly word,--they\r\nbear themselves toward their former masters very much as white men and\r\nwomen would under the same circumstances. True, by such deportment they\r\nunquestionably harm themselves; but consider of how little value life is\r\nfrom their stand-point. They grope in the darkness of this transition\r\nperiod, and rarely find any sure stay for the weary arm and the fainting\r\nheart. Their souls are filled with a great, but vague longing for\r\nfreedom; they battle blindly with fate and circumstance for the unseen\r\nand uncomprehended, and seem to find every man's hand raised against\r\nthem. What wonder that they fill the land with restlessness!\r\n\r\nHowever unfavorable this exhibit of the negroes in respect to labor may\r\nappear, it is quite as good as can be made for the whites. I everywhere\r\nfound a condition of affairs in this regard that astounded me. Idleness,\r\nnot occupation, seemed the normal state. It is the boast of men and\r\nwomen alike, that they have never done an hour's work. The public mind\r\nis thoroughly debauched, and the general conscience is lifeless as the\r\ngrave. I met hundreds of hale and vigorous young men who unblushingly\r\nowned to me that they had not earned a penny since the war closed. Nine\r\ntenths of the people must be taught that labor is even not debasing. It\r\nwas pitiful enough to find so much idleness, but it was more pitiful to\r\nobserve that it was likely to continue indefinitely. The war will not\r\nhave borne proper fruit, if our peace does not speedily bring respect\r\nfor labor, as well as respect for man. When we have secured one of these\r\nthings, we shall have gone far toward securing the other; and when we\r\nhave secured both, then indeed shall we have noble cause for glorying in\r\nour country,--true warrant for exulting that our flag floats over no\r\nslave.\r\n\r\nMeantime, while we patiently and helpfully wait for the day in which\r\n\r\n                    \"All men's good shall\r\n    Be each man's rule, and Universal Peace\r\n    Lie like a shaft of light across the land,\"\r\n\r\nthere are at least five things for the nation to do; make haste slowly\r\nin the work of reconstruction; temper justice with mercy, but see to it\r\nthat justice is not overborne; keep military control of these lately\r\nrebellious States, till they guaranty a republican form of government;\r\nscrutinize carefully the personal fitness of the men chosen therefrom as\r\nrepresentatives in the Congress of the United States; and sustain\r\ntherein some agency that shall stand between the whites and the blacks,\r\nand aid each class in coming to a proper understanding of its privileges\r\nand responsibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREVIEWS AND LITERARY NOTICES.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Herman; or, Young Knighthood._ By E. FOXTON. Boston: Lee & Shepard.\r\n\r\nWe are entirely uncertain whether this work will be recognized for what\r\nit is by our young country-folk; but we are very certain, if it is not,\r\nit will be our young country-folk's loss. It is, we suppose, a novel.\r\nIts author admits that it is a story; but it is not at all the kind of\r\nbanquet to which novel-readers are usually invited. We can fancy the\r\nconsternation which awaits the devourers of story-books,--those persons,\r\nwe mean, whose reading is confined to novels, who lie in wait for Mrs.\r\nWood and Miss Braddon, and stretch their sales into the double-figured\r\nthousands, through whose passive brains plot after plot travels in quick\r\nsuccession and leaves no sign, and whose name, we fear, is Legion. They\r\nwill eagerly seize this new story with the romantic title, be launched\r\nauspiciously into gay ball-rooms, glide graciously among the familiar\r\nflounces, dances, and small talk, only to find themselves suddenly and\r\nwithout warning in some gulf of grave discussion opening out deceptively\r\nfrom the sparkling stream of the story, or stranded on some lofty\r\nsentiment never dreamt of in their philosophy. For the author's mind is,\r\nin the best sense of the word, a discursive one. It is full of positive\r\nthought, and strikes out right and left like a school-boy who must needs\r\nrelieve his superabundant spirits by pinching his sister's ear,\r\nthrusting his fists in his brother's face, kicking aside the\r\nfoot-cushion, and making a plunge at the cat, while he is performing the\r\nsimple operation of walking across the room. This book is written out of\r\na mind so full of wit and wisdom that it overflows at the gentlest\r\ntouch. It has more sense and learning and power than go to the making up\r\nof a dozen ordinary novels. The very prodigality of its resources is a\r\nstumbling-block. Its great fault is its _muchness_, if we may borrow a\r\nterm from Hawthorne's mint. It is like a young minister's first sermon,\r\ninto which he frantically attempts to cram the whole body of divinity.\r\nEspecially in the early part of the book, we are constantly drawn away\r\nfront the story by delightful little essays, sometimes read to us by the\r\nauthor himself,--sometimes wrought into the conversations by playful\r\nanecdotes, by effective character-sketches, and vivid scene and\r\nscenery-paintings. They do not always materially help forward the story,\r\nnor do they always hinder it. They often give it an air of reality, and\r\nthey always help to utilize the author's idea. If they do not avail his\r\nart, they avail his didactics. Where they are not good for the story,\r\nthey are good for something. By many thoughtless, and by all mere\r\nnovel-readers, they will probably be _skipped_; but for ourselves, we\r\nconfess, that, though high art may regard them as blemishes, we should\r\nnot know how to give the order for their removal. Considered in\r\nthemselves, in their style and sentiment, the little digressions, the\r\nlong conversations, the carefully wrought side-scenes are so rich in a\r\ncertain tender religious wisdom, yet crisp and piquant withal, and so\r\nfull of living thought on the great questions of the day, that we dwell\r\nin them with enjoyment, though with a compunctious half-consciousness\r\nthat they ought not to be there.\r\n\r\nBut though we are tolerant of discursiveness where it affects only the\r\nflow of the story, we like it less where it disturbs the flow of the\r\nstyle. A paragraph ought never, by the mere form into which it is cast,\r\nto require to be read over and over in order to get at the meaning. Yet\r\nwe are confident that nine readers out of ten would need to read the\r\nfollowing sentence more than once in order to get at its true\r\nconstruction:--\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that I were able to conform myself to that further fictitious, not\r\nto say factitious, standard of taste, according to which, just\r\nas,--though a hemorrhage from the nose, howsoever ill-timed,\r\ndistressing, or even dangerous to the patient, is comic,--one from the\r\nlungs is poetical and tragic; and an extravasation of blood about the\r\nheart is not inappropriate to the demise of the most romantic civil\r\nhero, (who would seem, indeed, capable of escaping an earthly\r\nimmortality only by means of pulmonary disease or some accident, unless\r\npounced upon by some convenient and imposing epidemic,) while a similar\r\naffection of the brain of an imaginary personage can be rendered\r\naffecting or excusable only by a weight of years and virtues in the\r\npatient; so certain moral diseases, alias sins, in actual life making\r\nthe sinner by no means peculiarly engaging, have in fiction acquired a\r\nprescriptive right to our regard!\"\r\n\r\nBut the true power and pathos of the book rise ever high and higher, and\r\nall minor defects are flooded out of sight. It is no small happiness\r\nthat we have to do from the beginning with a family hitherto wellnigh\r\nunknown in American noveldom,--a family rich and not vulgar, beautiful\r\nand not frivolous, highly educated and fastidious, yet neither bitter\r\nnor disdainful,--refined, honorable, serene, affectionate. We are not\r\nmerely told that they are so. We mingle with them, we see it for\r\nourselves, and are refreshed and revived thereby. It is pleasant to miss\r\nfor once the worldly mother, the empty daughter, the glare and glitter\r\nof shoddy, the low rivalry, the degrading strife, which can hardly be\r\nheld up even to our reprobation without debasing us. Whether or not the\r\nbest mode of inculcating virtue is that which gives us an example to\r\nimitate rather than a vice to shun, we are sure it is the most\r\nagreeable. It is infinitely sweeter to be attracted by the fragrance of\r\nParadise than to be repelled by the sulphurous fumes of Pandemonium. The\r\ncontemplation of such a home as this book opens to us is pleasant to the\r\neyes and good for the heart's food, and to be desired to make one wise.\r\nA pure domestic love shines through it, tender, tranquil, and intense.\r\nIts inmates are daintily, delicately, yet distinctly drawn. They are\r\ncourteous without being cold, playful without rudeness, serious, yet\r\nsensible, reticent or demonstrative as the case may be, yet in all\r\nthings natural. It is not book, it is life. Each is a type of character\r\nmatchless in its way, but each is also a living soul, whose outward\r\nelegance and grace are but the fit adjuncts of its inward purity and\r\npeace. Even if such a home never existed, we should still defend its\r\nportrayal, as the Vicar of Wakefield wrote his wife's epitaph during her\r\nlife that she might have a chance to become worthy of its praise.\r\n\r\nIt is a happiness also to make the acquaintance of women who are\r\nbrilliant and not bad, whose innocence does not run into insipidity, who\r\nare no less queens than vassals, worthily the one, royally the other. We\r\nmeet in books many single-women, but they are usually embittered by\r\ndisappointment or by hope deferred,--angular, envious, busybodies in\r\nother women's matters; or they are comically odd, self-ridiculing, and\r\nunrestful; or, worst of all, they have become morally attenuated by a\r\nthwarted love or a long course of dismal and absurd self-sacrifice and\r\nare so resigned, colorless, and impassive, that, like Naaman, we are\r\ntempted to go away in a rage. But where shall we find another\r\nClara,--beautiful, attractive, radiant, serenely living her happy life,\r\n\"aimless,\" but not \"anxious,\" doing every day the duty that lies next\r\nher hand, scarcely knowing that it is duty, never fancying that she is\r\nout of her sphere or thinking whether she is in it, tranced in tranquil\r\nreveries that spiritualize instead of spoiling her, and, shining ever\r\nalong her untroubled way,\r\n\r\n    \"With the moon's beauty and the moon's soft pace\"?\r\n\r\nAll the chief actors in the book are clever, rising often into the high\r\nlatitudes of genius, yet without that perverse _kink_ which is wont to\r\nmar all satisfaction. There is no taint of poison in the air they\r\nbreathe. There is no passion hovering on the border-land of crime, or\r\ndefiling its garments with the dust of earthliness. Love is what it ever\r\nshould be, all noble and elevating,--worship as well as\r\ndevotion,--annihilating only selfishness, sanctifying, not sacrificing,\r\nduty. There is no yielding to a depraved popular taste, no abdication of\r\nan inherited throne to stand on a level with the unthinking crowd and\r\nreceive its worthless applauses. Rather the crowd is bidden higher, to\r\nenter upon its own rightful, royal possessions. This is the true\r\nmissionary work. Manhood and womanhood in their best development are the\r\ntheme of the book; and they are touched with so fine a grace, outlined\r\nwith so true a pencil, tinted with so imperial a splendor, that the most\r\ndiscontented may be satisfied. Does this seem slight praise? In truth it\r\ncan most rarely be bestowed. Why, it is matter for thanksgiving when we\r\nare not outraged!\r\n\r\nOn this Field of the Cloth of Gold rises a knight without fear and\r\nwithout reproach. Purely human and most heroic, as unpretending as\r\nspotless, womanly, gentle, yet of positive and aggressive strength,\r\nstrength to do silently, to endure steadfastly, to die conquered, yet\r\nvictorious, to live in the front, yet alone,--is it an ideal character?\r\nSo much the more let it be studied, that our souls may absorb it and\r\nproduce the reality: for it is ideal after no impossible sort. In his\r\nsimple purity, in his fidelity to right, in his chivalry and his\r\nreligion, he is only what all can be. It is an American boy, called to\r\nno loftier living, to no more \"extraordinary seeking,\" than his country\r\nhas a right to claim from all her sons,--called to no sterner sacrifice,\r\nto no severer suffering, than many a brave lad has faced and may yet\r\nface again. If we could read the silent history of these last years,\r\nshould we not find in thousands of young hearts the story of a resolve\r\nno less firm, of a pain scarcely less deadly? The pent-up agony in the\r\nprison-house of Slavery before Northern cannon thundered at its doors is\r\na tale that will never be told. God grant its horrors may never be\r\nsurpassed,--never renewed! But we cannot say that Herman's woe is too\r\nhighly wrought. We cannot console ourselves with thinking, that, however\r\nvividly delineated, it is mere fictitious suffering. We know that such\r\nthings have happened,--yes, and things immeasurably worse. We know that\r\nHerman did only what any high and clear-souled man ten years ago might\r\nhave owed to do, and that he suffered only the natural consequences of\r\nsuch doing. Ten years ago this country of ours was so that a man might\r\nlegally and without redress be tortured to death for doing that which\r\nwas not merely a plain obedience to the plainest precepts of the Bible,\r\nbut what in any other Christian country than our own would have been\r\ninstantly recognized as a deed of the highest heroism. And if we are not\r\ncareful to do justly, all the new ropes wherewith we have bound this\r\naccursed Samson of Slavery will be broken like a thread, and our last\r\nstate be worse than our first.\r\n\r\nWe know no work of fiction so full as this of beauty and wisdom, so free\r\nfrom folly, so resplendent with intellectual life, with moral purity,\r\nand Christian holiness, so apt to teach, so graceful in the teaching. We\r\nfollow it with admiration and sympathy, from its gay beginning, through\r\nall the pain, the passion, and the peace, to the heartache of its\r\nclosing pages,--that close, supremely sad, yet strangely beautiful. \"She\r\nsang to him, and he slept; she spoke, and he did not awaken.\" It is the\r\nrecord of heavy struggle, of defeat that was triumph, and triumph that\r\nwas Heaven.\r\n\r\nWe offer no congratulations to the new author; nor do we deprecate for\r\nhim any harsh censure;--not only because praise and censure seem alike\r\nrugged and halting by the sweet strains we seek to celebrate, but\r\nbecause he who in his \"saintly solitude\" can create a world so fair is\r\nindependent of these light afflictions. For him there is always\r\nsympathy, great companionship, and godlike work. From this Earth can\r\nnothing take away; than this she has nothing more to give.\r\n\r\n\r\n_History of the Rise and Influence of the Spirit of Rationalism in\r\nEurope._ By W. E. H. LECKY, M. A. Two Vols. New York: D. Appleton & Co.\r\n\r\nMr. Lecky has given us a book replete with interesting matter; and yet,\r\nowing to some lack of intellectual mastery in him over his materials, it\r\nleaves a singularly vague and dispiriting impression on the mind in\r\nreading it. The author has a plethora of knowledge in regard to the\r\nsurface changes in history, but no insight whatever apparently into the\r\nmeaning of history itself, into the philosophic causes which these\r\nchanges attest and obey. He is a man of uncommon bulk, but deficient\r\nmuscle. His mental furniture enfeebles his intellectual faculty. His\r\nbody obstructs his soul. _Sumptus fructum superat._ His book costs the\r\nauthor more than it comes to. He is so absorbed in the contemplation of\r\nthe accidents of history as to forget that history itself is but a\r\nnarrow river, conducting to the broad, illimitable ocean of human\r\nbrotherhood or equality,--and that to stand upon the bank, therefore,\r\nand watch its successive waves, instead of manfully leaping in and\r\ncommitting one's life and fortunes to it, is scarcely the part of a wise\r\nman. Mr. Lecky's essay would seem to have originated more in a desire to\r\ntry his hand at theorizing than in any necessity to ventilate some\r\nprevious _drifts_ from the beginning to the end of his book. You never\r\nfeel yourself in a compact, water-tight boat, obedient to rudder and\r\nsail, but at most on a raft, drifting at the absolute _gre_ of the\r\ntides, in a certain _general_ direction, no doubt, but with no foresight\r\nof the specific intellectual port at which you are to bring up.\r\nOccasionally the mist condenses, the rain patters down, you catch a\r\nglimpse of far-off mountaintops, and suppose the entire landscape will\r\nsoon be bathed in sunshine. But no, a new inrush of illustrative facts\r\ntakes place, and all is fog again. There is a great deal of good writing\r\nin the book, and it leaves nothing to be desired in the way of advanced\r\n_sentiment_. But we fail to perceive its bearing upon the progress of\r\nideas. It may flatter a superficial scientific optimism, but it will\r\nobstruct rather than promote the interests of philosophic thought, for\r\nthis reason, that it inclines the reader to suspend his convictions upon\r\nsome fated _progress of events_ which will of itself do the world's\r\nthinking for it, and turn both heart and mind at last into cheerful,\r\ncomplacent pensioners of science.\r\n\r\nThe object of Mr. Lecky is to trace the history of _the spirit_ of\r\nRationalism,--the spirit which disposes men to reject all belief founded\r\nupon authority, and to make the causes of phenomena intrinsic and not\r\nextrinsic to the phenomena themselves. Rationalism, if we rightly\r\napprehend Mr. Lecky, is not any precise doctrine or system of doctrine,\r\nbut only a diffused bias or tendency of the mind to regard the power\r\nwhich is operative in Nature and history as a rigidly creative or\r\nconstitutive power, rather than a redemptive or formative one. Doubtless\r\nMr. Lecky, if he should ever consider the subject, would be free to\r\nadmit that the creative action implies a necessary reaction on the part\r\nof the creature. But he has manifestly no sympathy with the early or\r\nimaginative faiths of the world, which represent creation as a physical\r\nrather than a rational exhibition of the Divine power. His entire book\r\nis written in the service of the opposite conception. To be sure, he\r\ndoes not discuss the new faith as a theologian, but only as an\r\nhistorian. It is not an affair of the heart with him, but only of the\r\nhead. He takes no pains to commend it as an advance in point of truth\r\nupon the old faith, and does not once even avow his own intellectual\r\nidentification with it. In short, he is not the retained attorney of the\r\nnew faith, but its disinterested annalist, treating it simply as an\r\nhistoric change wrought in the texture of men's thought, promoted by\r\nsuch and such causes, attested by such and such effects, but independent\r\nof all partisan judgment and clamor either favorable or adverse. Still\r\nthere is no doubt of the historian's own private bias. He applauds _ex\r\nanimo_ the change he records; and his book would have gained greatly in\r\ninterest, if he could only have written it a little more from the heart\r\nand a little less from the head. For then, apart from the incidental\r\nadvantage which would accrue to it, to the reader's imagination, as\r\nbeing a revelation of the author's living personality, we think the\r\nauthor himself could hardly fail to have seen, before he had finished\r\nhis task, that there is no essential contradiction between the world's\r\nearlier and later faiths; that these faiths differ not as good and evil\r\nor true and false differ, but only and at most as root and stem and\r\nflower differ in the plant, or birth, growth, and maturity in the\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nThe lesson which Mr. Lecky inculcates upon his reader is this: that\r\ncivilization and miracle are fatally opposed; that the former waxes or\r\nwanes precisely as the latter is discredited or accredited. History\r\nshows civilization to have thriven precisely as men have outgrown their\r\nbelief in miracle, or the possibility of any outward Divine intervention\r\nin Nature, and have learned to insist upon strictly natural causes for\r\nall natural effects. The fruits of Mr. Lecky's research on this subject\r\nare varied and interesting, and we cordially commend his volumes to the\r\nreader as an inviting storehouse of materials for reflection; but we\r\nvery much doubt whether the school of thought he represents has, on the\r\nwhole, mastered the problem of civilization any more thoroughly than its\r\nrival. The difference between the two schools is, indeed, one of\r\nprinciple more than of words; but we cannot help thinking, nevertheless,\r\nthat the controversy is needlessly protracted on both sides, for want of\r\na sufficiently definite and comprehensive statement of the point in\r\ndispute. Let us see whether we cannot make at least an approximation to\r\nsuch a statement.\r\n\r\nWhat is agitated, then, between the two rival schools of thought is the\r\nDivine power: not the existence of such power, for there is no\r\nnoticeable difference on that point, but only its quality or mode of\r\noperation. The Orthodox attribute to God a strictly moral, which is a\r\nspecific method of action, addressed to purely personal or subjective\r\nissues; their opponents, a strictly physical, which is a universal\r\nmethod, addressed to purely impersonal and objective issues. The one\r\nparty assigns to God a finite personality, or one limited by Nature; the\r\nother, an indefinite personality, as identified with natural law. The\r\nOrthodox, of course, maintain that God's _creative_ action was\r\nuniversal, inasmuch as it contemplated only cosmical issues; but as that\r\nmode of action was exhausted by its own universality, His subsequent\r\nrelation to His creatures must be purely administrative, as expressing\r\nHis personal pleasure or displeasure in their various functioning. The\r\nother side do not dogmatize about the Divine power, or its method of\r\naction, in the abstract. They only insist, as against their antagonists,\r\nthat the Divine administration of Nature is _not_, within the limits of\r\nour science, personal; that it is not a power exerted _upon_ Nature, or\r\nfrom without, and in contravention of her ordinary processes; that, so\r\nfar as our _knowledge_ goes, on the contrary, whatever may be our faith,\r\nit is a power invariably exerted _through_ Nature, or from within, and\r\ntherefore in habitual consistency with her ordinary effects. In other\r\nwords, they insist, that, so far as the Divine power is cognizable to\r\nus, it falls exclusively within and never without the routine of Nature;\r\nand as universality is the characteristic of that routine, they do not\r\nhesitate, on behalf of science, to affirm that the Divine action is\r\nnever addressed to specific or differential results, but always to\r\nuniversal or identical ones. In short, they logically refuse to the\r\nDivine power as exhibited in Nature all personal or moral quality, as\r\ninferring on the part of Deity any possible unequal or inequitable\r\nrelations to the creatures He has made; and assign to all such reputed\r\npartial exhibitions of it a purely educative, and therefore universal,\r\nbearing upon the mind of the race.\r\n\r\nSuch, in brief, is the question agitated between the old and new faiths;\r\nwhether God acts outwardly _upon_ Nature, or inwardly _through_\r\nNature,--that is to say, whether His action is specific as addressed to\r\nprivate ends, or strictly universal as addressed only to public ends. If\r\nthe former hypothesis be true, then sense rightfully controls reason,\r\nand everything _is_ exactly what it _appears_. If the latter hypothesis\r\nbe true, then sense rightfully serves reason, and nothing is as it\r\nappears to be, namely, absolute and independent of everything else, but\r\nsimply phenomenal and relative to everything else. It is evident to a\r\nglance that a controversy so eminently scientific could never have gone\r\nto the unwholesome lengths which it has reached in our day, unless there\r\nwere something in it more than meets the eye: unless, for example, the\r\ninterests of morality, which is the only recognized bond of our existing\r\nsocieties, were at stake. For if one and the same law binds all Nature,\r\nthen plant and animal and man have one and the same destiny, so far as\r\ntheir nature goes. If, for example, the plant as one form of natural\r\nexistence, and the animal as another form, are what they severally are,\r\nby no means absolutely, or in themselves, but only by relation to all\r\nother plants and animals, then man, who is only a higher, that is, a\r\nmoral, or evil absolutely or in himself, but only relatively to all\r\nother men. And if we allow morality only this relative force,--if the\r\ngood man is not good absolutely or in himself, nor the evil man evil\r\nabsolutely or in himself,--why, then our existing civilization, which is\r\nbuilt upon such absoluteness, has a fictitious basis, and must fall to\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\n_Hinc ilia lachrymae._ This is why a question apparently of pure science\r\nturns out practically so full of inward heartburning and mutual\r\nreviling. Neither theology nor science is competent to the philosophic\r\nrecognition of man's associated destiny, and hence have neither of them\r\nthe secret of those perturbations which ever and anon gloom our\r\npolitical atmosphere and shut out to the eye of sensuous thought the\r\nentire future of the race. Philosophy alone possesses this secret,\r\nbecause it alone perceives that all our political, civil, and even\r\ndomestic broils grow out of this identical warfare between men's\r\nreligions and scientific convictions,--have no other source than that\r\npersistent insubmission which the interests of force, as represented by\r\npriesthoods and governments, are under to the interests of freedom,\r\nrepresented by society. Philosophy mediates between the religious and\r\nsecular thought of mankind, by making the sphere of God's universal\r\naction identical with that of man's organic necessities, and the sphere\r\nof His specific action identical with that of man's moral freedom: so\r\nharmonizing the two in one subject. Philosophy alone, in short, is\r\ncompetent to the future of human destiny, because it alone adjusts the\r\nrelation of morals to physics, alone adjusts the specific interests\r\navouched by religion with the universal interests avouched by science.\r\nAnd its competence is owing to this fact exclusively, that it alone\r\napprehends or appreciates the distinctively social destiny of man, a\r\ndestiny in which the interests of the most intense and exquisite freedom\r\nor individuality are bound up with the interests of the most imperious\r\nnecessity or community,--or, what is the same thing, which presents\r\nevery man no longer in subjective or moral, but only in objective or\r\naesthetic, contrast with his kind, that so the general harmony may be\r\ninflamed by the widest partial diversity. Thus philosophy bids society\r\nrecognise itself at once as God's perfect work on earth,--bids it rise\r\nto instant self-consciousness as the real Divine substance which Church\r\nand State have only feebly typified, and put on all Divine strength and\r\npeace as its rightful breastplate and ornament. For if all these\r\nfleeting phenomenal discords among men, upon which our existing\r\ncivilization proceeds, claim no longer an absolute, but only a relative\r\nDivine sanction, a sanction in relation to the interests of human\r\nsociety exclusively, what remains for society to do but to organize\r\nitself afresh upon an eternal basis, that is, upon the acknowledgment of\r\na force in man infinitely transcending his moral force, because it\r\nforever unites instead of disjoining him with God, being the force of\r\nspontaneous or productive action?\r\n\r\n\r\n_An Address on the Limits of Education, read before the Massachusetts\r\nInstitute of Technology_, November 16th, 1865. By JACOB BIGELOW, M. D.\r\nBoston: E. P. Dutton & Co.\r\n\r\nDr. Bigelow has had the honor of naturalizing, if not of inventing, the\r\nname of the Institute before which he delivered this address. His work\r\non the Elements of Technology was the first in which this name appeared,\r\nat least in recent times. It designates that class of sciences which\r\nbear on art,--sciences of practical application. Dr. Bigelow, in this\r\naddress, places himself emphatically with those who believe that mental\r\ndiscipline can be obtained as well by useful as by useless studies, and\r\nwho think it a waste of time \"to spend five years of the most\r\nsusceptible part of life in acquiring a minute familiarity with tongues\r\nwhich are daily becoming more obsolete.\" We welcome this address as an\r\nimportant ally for those who desire that our schools and colleges shall\r\nnot insist that every young man wishing for their advantages shall\r\ndevote one half of his time to the details of Greek and Latin Grammar\r\nand Prosody. Dr. Bigelow is no rash reformer, no youthful enthusiast, no\r\nreckless radical. He has the confidence of the whole community for his\r\nscience, scholarship, and ripe judgment. When, therefore, a man of his\r\ncharacter and position, without passion or prejudice, publishes the\r\nconclusions which this address contains, we may hope that a change is at\r\nhand in the course of study now pursued in our colleges and\r\nuniversities, and in the schools which prepare for them. Dr. Bigelow\r\ndoes not desire Latin or Greek to be excluded from the college course;\r\nbut he thinks that \"under the name of classical literature they premise\r\nand afterward carry on a cumbrous burden of dead languages, kept alive\r\nthrough the dark ages, and now stereotyped in England, by the persistent\r\nconservatism of a privileged order.\" He thinks that the mind might be\r\ndisciplined and trained quite as well and more cheaply by other studies\r\nthan that of the Greek language. He is of opinion, that, if Greek should\r\nonce cease to be made a requisite in our universities, though it would\r\nbe studied still by a certain class, it would never be adopted again as\r\nan indispensable academic study.\r\n\r\nIn all this we quite agree with him. Thus far, almost everything else\r\nhas been subordinated in our college course to the study of Greek and\r\nLatin. At least one half of the time of a young man desiring a liberal\r\neducation, from twelve to twenty years of age, is given up to Greek and\r\nLatin. The other half is left for Mathematics, Geography, History,\r\nGeology, Chemistry, Natural History, Metaphysics, Ethics, Astronomy, and\r\nGeneral Reading. Before entering college, his time must be almost wholly\r\noccupied with the study of Latin, Greek, and Mathematics. For he is\r\nrequired, in order to enter our principal university, to know Virgil,\r\nCaesar, Cicero, Xenophon, three books of the Iliad, Arithmetic, Algebra,\r\nand Geometry, and to have the whole Latin and Greek Grammar at his\r\ntongue's end. He must also be able to _write_ Latin, and to write Greek\r\n_with the accents_. But he need not know a word of American or Modern\r\nHistory (he must know the History of Greece and Rome),--not a word of\r\nany modern language or modern science,--nothing of Chemistry, Astronomy,\r\nGeology,--nothing of modern literature. Though he must be able to write\r\nGreek, he need not be able to write English. And so, after being obliged\r\nto spend the largest part of his time _before_ entering college in\r\nlearning Greek and Latin philology, is he then allowed to drop these\r\nstudies and begin others? Not so. He is not even permitted to leave off\r\nGreek and Latin philology, in order to become acquainted with Greek and\r\nLatin literature, much less to become acquainted with any other. Nearly\r\nall the way through college he keeps on _writing Creek and Latin\r\nexercises_; and the result of it all is, that he not unfrequently\r\nbecomes so disgusted with these languages that he forgets them as soon\r\nas he can, and on leaving college can hardly read with ease the simplest\r\nGreek or Latin book.\r\n\r\nSuch being, as is well known to all graduates of college, the present\r\nstate of affairs, we welcome with profound gratitude the present\r\naddress of Dr. Bigelow. Coming from such a source, containing such\r\nunanswerable arguments, expressed in so lucid and striking a form, the\r\neffect must be excellent. We have dwelt upon a single point of the\r\naddress, because it seemed to us the most important and valuable part of\r\nit. But there is in it much besides, that is both instructive and\r\ninteresting; and we recommend the pamphlet as one to be carefully read,\r\nand by no means to be confounded with the commoner style of public\r\naddresses.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Vida de Abran Lincoln, decimosesto Presidente de los Estados Unidos,\r\nprecedida de una Introduccion._ Por D. F. SARMIENTO. Nueva York: D.\r\nAppleton y Ca.\r\n\r\nThis life of our lamented President, by the distinguished Argentine, now\r\nMinister to Washington, is a very interesting circumstance, aside from\r\nthe merit of the work, which is very great. It is an amazing fact that\r\nso few Eastern Americans read and speak Spanish, when one portion of our\r\ncountry borders upon a Republic that speaks that language only, and when\r\nwe are so nearly allied in feeling and free principles of government to\r\nSouth America, _twenty-three_ of whose Republics are now represented in\r\nthe diplomatic body at Washington. The most remarkable of these\r\ngentlemen is Colonel D. F. Sarmiento, who has done more to elevate the\r\nRepublic he represents than any other individual; for he has devoted\r\nmany years of his active and patriotic life to introducing North\r\nAmerican, and indeed we may say Massachusetts, systems of education into\r\nSouth America,--first into Chili, where he was an exile for twenty\r\nyears, during the reign of the tyrants who brought such suffering upon\r\nthe Argentine Republic, and since that time into the Argentine Republic\r\nitself, where he was at one time Governor of the province of San Juan,\r\nat another, Minister of Instruction in the province and city of Buenos\r\nAyres, also Senator in their Congress. He took up the cause of his\r\ncountry when quite a boy, and has devoted himself to it, either in the\r\nfield or as an educator, ever since. His eye has always been open to\r\nbehold the workings of the free institutions that he desired to see\r\nestablished in it, and he has been probably the most powerful instrument\r\nin inducing his government to adopt the Constitution and laws of the\r\nUnited States, so that it is truly a sister Republic, and as such\r\nappeals irresistibly to our sympathy.\r\n\r\nThe Life of Mr. Lincoln, which he has now written for his own\r\ncountrymen, has of course been gathered chiefly from biographies already\r\nwritten; but the interest of the work consists in the adaptation of it\r\nto the South American needs. To set forth the dignity of labor, the\r\nsupremacy of the moral sentiments, the duty of education for the whole\r\npeople, has been his aim; and he has enjoyed, and made others enjoy, the\r\nfact that two men of the people, _par excellence_, who had no\r\nadventitious aids of wealthy friends, or even of educated friends, did,\r\nby force of character and native powers of mind, come to be the free\r\nchoice of this great people for President and Vice-President at a time\r\nwhen a new epoch opened in its history: for even before the war broke\r\nout, the \"irrepressible conflict\" was felt to be upon us, and we needed\r\nthe best of helmsmen, and the wisest,--in that sense of the word\r\n_wisdom_ which includes goodness as well as intelligence. We hope to see\r\nthe Introduction to this work translated in full. The book closes with a\r\ntranslation of Mr. Lincoln's favorite poem, \"Oh, why should the spirit\r\nof mortal be proud?\" by young Bartholomew Mitre, one of Senor\r\nSarmiento's legation, a son of the President of the Argentine Republic.\r\n\r\nA few months since, Senor Sarmiento issued a pamphlet, giving an account\r\nof the splendid resources of the Republic, in answer to inquiries made\r\nby those who wished to emigrate thither. He also wrote, many years ago,\r\na very interesting work, called \"Civilization and Barbarism,\" giving an\r\naccount of the reigns of some of those tyrants who so long arrested the\r\ngreat career of the Republic. That work is to be translated and\r\npublished, and will give a new feeling of interest in the history of\r\nSouth America's struggles for freedom. If it had been one united\r\ncountry, like the United States, instead of being cut up into so many\r\ngovernments, it would have been easier for foreigners (if, indeed, North\r\nAmericans should be called foreigners in South America) to follow it in\r\nits various changes; but, except where some great man, like Bolivar,\r\nmade himself conspicuous, it was difficult, without much investigation\r\nof details, to keep the track of their proceedings, or to tell which\r\nside was specifically right,--for a revolution, to be very interesting,\r\nmust have its foundation in great principles. The answer to this may\r\nbe, that to throw off the yoke of foreign dominion implies a great\r\nprinciple, and this is true; yet, until it is done intelligently rather\r\nthan instinctively, it does not challenge the attention of the world.\r\n\r\nSenor Sarmiento understands our institutions theoretically, as only\r\nthose foreigners can who have suffered the ills of tyranny and\r\noppression. Such men look at us from their various stand-points, and\r\nreason ethically upon the effect which freedom from all undue authority\r\nshould have upon the human mind, and they judge of us by our theory\r\nrather than by our practice; and when they come amongst us, they are\r\noften disappointed and disheartened to find that we, too, are selfish\r\nand hesitate to stretch the helping hand to our fellow-sufferers. When\r\nthey have patience to look deeper than the surface, however, they see\r\nthat there is a hidden might in the possibilities created by political\r\nfreedom; and since the outbreak of the war which has cost the nation\r\nsuch blood and treasure, they have seen that they were not\r\nmistaken,--that prosperity had not wholly spoiled us,--that the latent\r\nforce only needed a stimulus to resolve itself into noble action; and\r\nsuch lives as Lincoln's and Johnson's are to them the most glorious\r\nexpositions of the principles for which they have borne everything,\r\nsuffered everything, and hoped everything. Our suffering neighbors, the\r\nMexicans, may be helped in their struggles by the diffusion of this\r\nSpanish Life of Mr. Lincoln; for Sarmiento has dwelt with great\r\nminuteness upon all those features of our institutions which younger\r\nrepublics need to know in detail. It is, indeed, a manual of instruction\r\nfor any young republic. He describes minutely the proceedings of the\r\ntrial of Mr. Lincoln's assassins, evidently with the intention of\r\nshowing to his countrymen the mode of conducting such proceedings to\r\nsecure the ends of justice; and he often dwells upon the habitual regard\r\nof the majesty of Law evinced by our people in great emergencies, such\r\nas at the first election and at the re-election of Mr. Lincoln, when the\r\nwhole nation stood breathless, as it were, and reverentially waited for\r\nthat _vox populi_, which is theoretically _vox Dei_ in a republic, but\r\nwhich, alas! does not always prove so. If all parts of the Republic were\r\nintelligently educated, it would doubtless be so without fail; but\r\ndemagogues will always flourish and rule where there is ignorance and\r\nsuperstition, and the schoolmaster has not been abroad yet in the whole\r\nlength and breadth of our land. Sarmiento never loses an opportunity of\r\ndwelling with power and eloquence, when addressing his countrymen, as he\r\nhas often done upon this subject, on the advantages of a diffused\r\nknowledge among the people. Indeed, if all that he has written and\r\nsaid--even that portion of it which is recorded in the Buenos Ayres\r\nCommon School Annals--could be collected, it would make a noble volume\r\nfor all Spanish lands,--except, indeed, Old Spain, where there is not\r\nlight enough to read it by.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Richard Cobden, the Apostle of Free Trade: his Political Career and\r\nPublic Services._ A Biography. By JOHN MCGILCHRIST, Author of \"The Life\r\nof Lord Dundonald.\" etc. New York: Harper & Brothers.\r\n\r\nThis unassuming volume, of small size and plain covers, is strictly what\r\nit pretends to be, a simple biography, and therefore, apart from its\r\nsubject, it is a book to be commended. We do not see the author on every\r\npage, we are not forced to stop and listen to his reflections, nor to\r\nlong digressions into history, too commonly the fault in contemporaneous\r\nbiography of political men. The writer kindly remembers that the\r\nreader's ignorance or knowledge does not rest upon his conscience.\r\nTherefore we find in the little book what we wish, the story of Richard\r\nCobden, \"the international man\"; and it is a noble life-history, of\r\nwhich no American should be ignorant.\r\n\r\nHis success in business, remarkable as it was, is a greater source of\r\nwonder and admiration in England than in America, where the rapid\r\naccumulation of a fortune and the creation of a large mercantile house\r\nhave hitherto been matters of less rare occurrence than in older\r\ncountries; but the result and use of Richard Cobden's financial success\r\nare as unprecedented and surprising at one end of the money-making and\r\nmoney-spending world as the other.\r\n\r\nSoon after the establishment of his business house in Manchester, Mr.\r\nCobden interested himself in the public welfare of that city. His labors\r\nin behalf of the people attracted John Bright to his side, and at the\r\nearly age of thirty years he had made a \"decided local mark.\"\r\n\r\nThe saying, true and old as the fact men call character, that it is\r\nwhat an individual _is_, and not what he _does_, which marks him good or\r\nill among his kind, holds eminently true with regard to Richard Cobden.\r\nNot only was the range of his sympathies wide, the aim was sure; \"he\r\nnever lost sight,\" said Mr. Disraeli, \"of the sympathies of those whom\r\nhe addressed; and so, generally avoiding to drive his arguments to an\r\nextremity, he became, as a speaker, both practical and persuasive\"; and\r\nthe same power, brought to bear upon the actions and communications of\r\nevery day, made him a puissant servant of the Right.\r\n\r\nThere are three or four benefactions, however, which he was instrumental\r\nin conferring upon his own country, and indirectly upon all countries,\r\nfor which he has become justly celebrated. These are tangible and\r\nenduring proofs of character for those who knew him not, and show his\r\nsympathy to have transcended the bounds of mere sentiment, and passed\r\ninto the region of energetic self-sacrifice.\r\n\r\nHis efforts for the Anti-Corn-Law and Free Trade in England cannot be\r\nover-estimated. His life and strength and fortune were as nothing in\r\ncomparison with his desire to benefit the people. When he first\r\ncomprehended the necessity of labor in the Anti-Corn-Law struggle, he\r\ndetermined to press Mr. Bright, whose abilities had already produced a\r\ndeep impression upon Mr. Cobden, into the service; but Mr. Bright had\r\nlately lost his wife and had retired to Leamington, where Mr. Cobden\r\nfound him bowed down by grief. \"'Come with me,' said Cobden, 'and we\r\nwill never rest until we abolish the Corn-Laws.' Bright arose and went\r\nwith him; and thus was his great sorrow turned to the nation's and the\r\nworld's advantage.\"\r\n\r\nYears afterward, a short time before their final triumph in behalf of\r\nFree Trade, Mr. Cobden saw his fortune becoming materially injured,\r\nbesides his actual losses, estimated at twenty thousand pounds. His\r\ncourage failed at length, and he went so far as to write to Mr. Bright\r\nthat it was his intention to withdraw from the agitation and endeavor to\r\nretrieve his business. Then in turn Mr. Bright went to his friend, in\r\nManchester, and was successful in urging him to reconsider his\r\ndetermination. It was agreed among the Free-Traders to bestow eighty\r\nthousand pounds upon Mr. Cobden when the struggle was ended, and he soon\r\nafter received this manifest mark of their esteem and gratitude.\r\n\r\nHis labors to preserve peace, to strengthen the bonds of amity and\r\nweaken the causes for distrust between England and France, were earnest,\r\nunwearying, and fruitful in their results. His endeavors also to stem\r\nthe dreadful tide drifting into the Crimean War, and his appeal in the\r\nHouse of Commons, when war became imminent with China, \"that a select\r\ncommittee be appointed to examine into the state of our commercial\r\nrelations with that country,\" prove his unswerving principles, and his\r\nenergetic desire to preserve peace, until war should be declared a\r\nnational necessity.\r\n\r\nA man of the iron integrity of Cobden found himself necessarily in\r\nopposition to a man of popularity and self-aggrandizement, like\r\nPalmerston. Therefore, when the prime-minister announced his\r\ndetermination to reserve certain seats in his cabinet and ministry \"for\r\nthe leaders of advanced Liberalism,\" Richard Cobden declined the\r\nposition appointed to himself, saying to Lord Palmerston, \"that he had\r\nalways regarded him as a most dangerous minister for England, and his\r\nviews still remained the same.\"\r\n\r\nOne of Mr. Cobden's last efforts in the House of Commons was for the\r\nrepeal of the Paper Duty. He said,--\"If I were a young man just fresh\r\nfrom college, with nothing in the world but a good education, there is\r\nnothing I should work for with so much interest as making perfectly free\r\nthe press of this country, by removing all the taxes which tend to\r\nrender scarce and dear literary productions.\" The last time Mr. Cobden\r\naddressed a public audience, he said,--\"If I were a rich man, I would\r\nendow a professor's chair at Oxford and Cambridge to instruct the\r\nundergraduates of those universities in American history. I would\r\nundertake to say, and I speak advisedly, that I will take any\r\nundergraduate now at Oxford or Cambridge and ask him to put his finger\r\non Chicago, and I will undertake to say that he does not go within a\r\nthousand miles of it.... To bring up young men from college with no\r\nknowledge of the country in which the great drama of modern politics and\r\nnational life is now being worked out,--who are ignorant of a country\r\nlike America, but who, whether it be for good or for evil, must exercise\r\nmore influence in this country than any other class,--to bring up the\r\nyoung destitute of such knowledge, and to place them in responsible\r\npositions in the government is, I say, imperilling its best interests;\r\nand earnest remonstrances ought to be made against such a state of\r\neducation by every public man who values in the slightest degree the\r\nfuture welfare of his country.\" He concluded his speech by saying,--\"Do\r\nyou suppose it possible, when the knowledge of the principles of\r\npolitical economy has elevated the working classes, and when that\r\nelevation is continually progressing, that you can permanently exclude\r\nthe whole mass of them from the franchise? It is their interest to set\r\nabout solving the problem, and, to prevent any danger, they ought to do\r\nso without further delay.\"\r\n\r\nThe speech of Lord Palmerston in the House of Commons, after the death\r\nof Mr. Cobden, must be familiar to all readers. It came to round the\r\nmeasure of his eulogy, which had been sung in the East and in the West,\r\nin the North and in the South, and at length was heard even from the\r\nheart of Nazareth. We will not quote here the words of England's late\r\nminister; we would only urge those who love the study of nobility to\r\nread the Life of Richard Cobden, remembering such men \"are set here for\r\nexamples.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Human Hair, and the Cutaneous Diseases which affect it: together\r\nwith Essays on Acne, Sycosis, and Cloasma._ By B. C. PERRY,\r\nDermatologist. New York: James Miller.\r\n\r\nThis is the first book of its kind which has been published, and it is\r\nwell calculated to do good service in many ways. The author proposed to\r\nhimself in its preparation so to present all topics which relate to the\r\nhair and scalp in health and disease, that his treatise should not only\r\npossess value as being founded upon a just discrimination of\r\nphysiological principles, and interest for the general reader by reason\r\nof its familiarity of manner and the _ana_ by which the subject should\r\nbe illustrated, but also be of service to all who care to understand the\r\nnature of an important part of the physical system.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, this purpose has been well carried into effect; and\r\nevery chapter of the comely volume bears witness to the research and\r\nreflection of the author. With no similar work for a guide or model, it\r\nwas necessary to derive from the volumes of general and comparative\r\nphysiology such facts and deductions as related to the theme; and that\r\nsuch have been drawn from recognized authorities, the frequent\r\nreferences to the writings of Carpenter, Wilson, Plumbe, Neligan, Rayer,\r\nand others of like eminence, will show.\r\n\r\nTaking these collations of scientific statement as a basis, Dr. Perry\r\nproceeds--after giving some space to anecdotes and historical notes\r\nconcerning the _chevelure_ of former times--to speak at length of the\r\nformation and composition of the hair, of the unreasonable and\r\ninjudicious treatment to which it is commonly subjected, and of its\r\nproper management. He then passes on to discuss the cutaneous diseases\r\nto which the scalp is liable, and by which of course the hair is\r\naffected to its detriment, devotes some chapters to the discussion of\r\nsome diseases peculiar to the face, and concludes his volume with an\r\nAppendix containing an exposition of the constituents of many favorite\r\nand famous cosmetics, pointing out at the same time their true\r\ncharacter, the danger and unpleasantness of which, he says, are\r\ndisguised with much empirical skill.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental principle of Dr. Perry's treatise is, that the hair is\r\never in danger of being killed by much cherishing. He regards it as a\r\ndelicate vegetable, growing in a tender soil, and amply supplied by\r\nNature with the elements needed for its support and development. The\r\nskin of the head should not, he tells us, be subjected to any rough\r\ntreatment, neither should it be exposed to sudden alternations of\r\ntemperature. Cleanliness, gentle usage, and mild, innocuous\r\nspecifics--vegetable, whenever possible--are his reliance to keep the\r\nhair in good order, and restore the proper tone when lost by negligence\r\nor disease. The harsh friction of the stiff, \"penetrating hair-brush,\"\r\nthe scraping of the fine comb, \"the 'shampooing' operation of the\r\nhairdresser, with his exacerbating compound, a hundred degrees too\r\nviolent, and his cataract of cold water at the end,\" are all condemned\r\nas injurious, together with the myriad nostrums in the form of oils,\r\npomades, and the like. In dealing with these last, the author is indeed\r\nsevere, remarking that \"generally they are most mischievous, as well as\r\ncommon and filthy, mixtures, with nothing refined or elegant about them\r\nbut their titles.\" For greasy compounds he has no tolerance, charging\r\nupon them, that, although they may for the moment lubricate and soften\r\nthe hair, they burden the scalp, clog its pores, deaden the roots of the\r\nhair, and cause or increase many abnormal conditions of the cuticle.\r\nAnd certainly the formulae; which are quoted in the Appendix go far to\r\narouse in the reader the disgust for the popular preparations of the day\r\nwhich the writer does not attempt to conceal.\r\n\r\nIn those chapters which discuss the scalp and hair in disease, Dr. Perry\r\ntakes the ground, that the trouble is primarily in the skin, and that\r\nremedial treatment should therefore be directed to it. He mentions the\r\ndifferent eruptive and other affections in turn, and quotes the method\r\nof procedure advised by medical men, in connection with a statement of\r\nthe manner of practice which he has successfully adopted, illustrating\r\nhis views with very good wood-cuts derived from the atlases of Wilson,\r\nNeligan, and Dendy. In many cases he believes constitutional debility to\r\nbe the primary difficulty, and recommends a tonic regimen as the best\r\npreliminary to a course of local treatment.\r\n\r\nWithout, of course, attempting to give minute directions for the\r\nmanagement of all diseased conditions of the head and hair,--which would\r\nbe alike impracticable in a volume of this popular character and\r\nunprofitable to himself as a practitioner in such cases,--Dr. Perry\r\ngives a large number of recipes which his own experience or that of his\r\nfavorite authors has proved to be trustworthy and serviceable, the\r\ningredients of which are cleanly, simple, and agreeable, adding plain\r\nrules for the rational culture and preservation of the hair.\r\n\r\nThe book has its faults of style, to be sure,--principal among which is\r\na tendency to make too much of the scientific investigation and the\r\nacquirement of the writer, extending sometimes almost to pedantry in the\r\nuse of long words and large phrases; but it contains much information\r\nthat is important and can be found nowhere else except by troublesome\r\ncomparison of extended treatises, and a deal of plain common-sense that\r\nshould commend it to attention and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECENT AMERICAN PUBLICATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nVida de Abran Lincoln, Decimosesto Presidente de los Estados Unidos,\r\nprecedida de una Introduccion.
