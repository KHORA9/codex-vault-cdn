L. PETERMAN\r\n\r\nLate Principal and Professor of Civil Government in the Normal School\r\nof the Kentucky State College, and Member of the Kentucky State Senate\r\n\r\nNew York   Cincinnati   Chicago\r\nAmerican Book Company\r\n\r\nRevised to 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEDICATION.\r\n\r\nTo the thousands of devoted Teachers in every part of the land, who are\r\ntraining the boys and girls of to-day to a true conception of American\r\ncitizenship, and to a deeper love for our whole country, this little\r\nbook is dedicated by a Brother in the work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\nThis text-book begins \"at home.\"  The starting-point is the family, the\r\nfirst form of government with which the child comes in contact.  As his\r\nacquaintance with rightful authority increases, the school, the civil\r\ndistrict, the township, the county, the State, and the United States\r\nare taken up in their order.\r\n\r\nThe book is especially intended for use in the public schools.  The\r\nplan is the simplest yet devised, and is, therefore, well adapted to\r\npublic school purposes.  It has been used by the author for many years,\r\nin public schools, normal schools, and teachers' institutes.  It\r\ncarefully and logically follows the much praised and much neglected\r\nsynthetic method.  All students of the science of teaching agree that\r\nbeginners in the study of government should commence with the known,\r\nand gradually proceed to the unknown.  Yet it is believed this is the\r\nfirst textbook that closely follows this method of treating the subject.\r\n\r\nThe constant aim has been to present the subject in a simple and\r\nattractive way, in accordance with sound principles of teaching--that\r\nchildren may grow into such a knowledge of their government that the\r\nwelfare of the country may \"come home to the business and bosoms\" of\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nThe recent increase of interest among the people upon the subject of\r\ngovernment is a hopeful sign.  It will lead to a better knowledge of\r\nour political institutions, and hence give us better citizens.  Good\r\ncitizenship is impossible unless the people understand the government\r\nunder which they live.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly strange that every State in the Union maintains a\r\nsystem of public schools for the purpose of training citizens, and that\r\nthe course of study in so many States omits civil government, the\r\nscience of citizenship.\r\n\r\nThe author's special thanks are due Hon. Joseph Desha Pickett, Ph.D.,\r\nSuperintendent of Public Instruction of Kentucky, for the suggestion\r\nwhich led to the preparation of the work and for excellent thoughts\r\nupon the plan.  The author also desires to confess his obligation to\r\nPresident James K. Patterson, Ph.D., and Professor R. N. Roark, A.M.,\r\nof the Kentucky State College, Lexington, for valuable suggestions as\r\nto the method of treatment and the scope of the book.\r\n\r\nThe author has derived much assistance from the many admirable works\r\nupon the same subject, now before the country.  But he has not\r\nhesitated to adopt a treatment different from theirs when it has been\r\ndeemed advisable.  He submits his work to a discriminating public, with\r\nthe hope that he has not labored in vain in a field in which so many\r\nhave wrought.\r\n\r\n      ALEX. L. PETERMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA FEW WORDS TO TEACHERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY.--Every school should teach, and every child\r\nshould study, the principles of our government, in order:\r\n\r\n1. That by knowing his country better he may learn to love it more.\r\nThe first duty of the school is to teach its pupils to love \"God, home,\r\nand native land.\"\r\n\r\n2. That the child may learn that there is such a thing as just\r\nauthority; that obedience to it is right and manly; that we must learn\r\nto govern by first learning to obey.\r\n\r\n3. That he may know his rights as a citizen, and, \"knowing, dare\r\nmaintain;\" that he may also know his _duties_ as a citizen, and,\r\nknowing, may perform them intelligently and honestly.\r\n\r\n4. That he may understand the sacredness of the right of suffrage, and\r\naid in securing honest elections and honest discharge of official\r\nduties.\r\n\r\n5. That he may better understand the history of his country, for the\r\nhistory of the United States is largely the history of our political\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. ORAL INSTRUCTION.--There is no child in your school too young to\r\nlearn something of geography, of history, and of civil government.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese three subjects are so closely related that it is easier and\r\nbetter to teach them together.  All pupils not prepared for the\r\ntext-book should, at least on alternate days, be instructed by the\r\nteacher in a series of familiar talks, beginning with \"The Family,\" and\r\nproceeding slowly to \"The School,\" \"The Civil District or Township,\"\r\n\"The County,\" \"The State,\" and \"The United States.\"  In this system of\r\noral instruction, which is the best possible preparation for the formal\r\nstudy of civil government, the plan and outlines of this book may be\r\nused by the teacher with both profit and pleasure.\r\n\r\n3. PROPER AGE FOR STUDY OF THE TEXT-BOOK.--The plan and the style of\r\nthis book are so simple that the subject will be readily understood by\r\npupils reading in the \"Fourth Reader.\"  Even in our ungraded country\r\nschools the average pupil of twelve years is well prepared to begin the\r\nstudy of the text-book in civil government.  It is a serious mistake to\r\npostpone this much neglected subject until a later age.  Let it be\r\nintroduced early, that the child's knowledge of his government may\r\n\"grow with his growth, and strengthen with his strength.\"\r\n\r\n4. TWO PARTS.--It will be observed that the book is divided into two\r\nparts: the former treating the subject concretely, the latter treating\r\nit abstractly.\r\n\r\nBeginners should deal with things, not theories; hence, the abstract\r\ntreatment of civil government is deferred until the pupil's mind is\r\nable to grasp it.\r\n\r\nFor the same reason, definitions in the first part of the book are few\r\nand simple, the design of the author being to illustrate rather than to\r\ndefine; to lead the child to see, rather than to burden his mind with\r\nfine-spun statements that serve only to confuse.  In an elaborate work\r\nfor advanced students the method of treatment would, of course, be\r\nquite different.\r\n\r\n5. TOPICAL METHOD.--The subject of each paragraph is printed in\r\nbold-faced type, thus specially adapting the book to the topical method\r\nof recitation.  This feature also serves as a guide to the pupil in the\r\npreparation of his lesson.\r\n\r\n6. SUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS.--In deference to the best professional\r\nthought, the author has omitted all questions upon the text, knowing\r\nthat every live teacher prefers to frame his own questions.  The space\r\nusually allotted to questions upon the text is devoted to suggestive\r\nquestions, intended to lead the pupil to think and to investigate for\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThe author sincerely hopes that the teacher will not permit the pupil\r\nto memorize the language of the book, but encourage him to express the\r\nthought in his own words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE FAMILY.\r\n\r\nIntroductory;

that is, to four\r\nforms of organized authority.  They have duties, as citizens of a\r\ntownship or civil district, as citizens of a county, as citizens of\r\nsome one of the States, and as citizens of the United States.  All\r\npersons are, or have been, members of a family; some also live under a\r\nvillage or city government; and most children are subject to the\r\ngovernment, of some school.  Many people in this country live under six\r\ngovernments--namely, the family, the township or civil district, the\r\nvillage or city, the county, the State, and the United States; while\r\nchildren who live in villages or cities, and attend school, are subject\r\nto seven different governments.  These organizations are so closely\r\nrelated that the duties of the people as citizens of one do not\r\nconflict with their duties as citizens of the others.  The better\r\ncitizen a person is of one of these governments the better citizen he\r\nis of all governments under which he lives.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION.--Each of us is a member of some family.  We were born into\r\nthe family circle, and our parents first taught us to obey.  By\r\ninsisting upon obedience, parents govern their children, and thus keep\r\nthem from evil and from danger.  The family, then, is a form of\r\ngovernment, established for the good of the children themselves, and\r\nthe first government that each of us must obey.\r\n\r\nPURPOSES.--The family exists for the rearing and training of children,\r\nand for the happiness and prosperity of parents.  All children need the\r\ncomforts and restraints of home life.  They are growing up to be\r\ncitizens and rulers of the country, and should learn to rule by first\r\nlearning to obey.  The lessons of home prepare them for life and for\r\ncitizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMBERS.\r\n\r\nThe members of the family are the father, the mother, and the children;\r\nand the family government exists for all, especially for the children,\r\nthat they may be protected, guided, and taught to become useful men and\r\nwomen.  The welfare of each and of all depends upon the family\r\ngovernment, upon the care of the parents and the obedience of the\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nRIGHTS.--The members have certain rights; that is, certain just claims\r\nupon the family.  Each has a right to all the care and protection that\r\nthe family can give: a right to be kindly treated; a right to be spoken\r\nto in a polite manner; a right to food, clothing, shelter, and an\r\nopportunity to acquire an education; a right to the advice and warning\r\nof the older members; a right to the respect of all.\r\n\r\nDUTIES.--As each of the members has his rights, each also has his\r\nduties; for where a right exists, a duty always exists with it.  It is\r\nthe duty of each to treat the others kindly; to teach them what is\r\nright and what is wrong; to aid them in their work; to comfort them in\r\ntheir sorrows; and to rejoice with them in their gladness.  It is the\r\nduty of the children to love their parents; to obey them in all things;\r\nto respect older persons; and to abstain from bad habits and bad\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOFFICERS.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the family government are the father and the mother.\r\nThey were made officers when they were married, so that the rulers of\r\nthe family are also members of the family.  The office of a parent is a\r\nholy office, and requires wisdom for the proper discharge of its duties.\r\n\r\nPOWERS.--The parents have power to make rules, to decide when these\r\nhave been broken, and to insist that they shall be obeyed.  They make\r\nthe law of the family, enforce the law, and explain the law.  They have\r\nsupreme control over their children in all the usual affairs of life,\r\nuntil the children arrive at the legal age--twenty-one years.\r\n\r\nDUTIES, RESPONSIBILITY.--Parents should be firm and just in their\r\nrulings; they should study the welfare of their children, and use every\r\neffort to train them to lives of usefulness and honor.  It is the duty\r\nof parents to provide their children with food, clothing, shelter, and\r\nthe means of acquiring an education.  There is no other responsibility\r\nso great as the responsibility of fathers and mothers.  They are\r\nresponsible for themselves, and the law makes them partly responsible\r\nfor the conduct of their children.  Therefore, one of the highest\r\nduties of a parent to his children is to exact obedience in all right\r\nthings, in order that the children may be trained to true manhood and\r\nwomanhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]To the teacher--Do not assign to the average class more than two or\r\nthree pages of the text as a lesson.  Make haste slowly.  When each\r\nchapter is completed let it be reviewed at once, while the pupil's\r\ninterest is fresh.\r\n\r\nSee that the \"Suggestive Questions\" at the end of the chapter are not\r\nneglected.  If necessary, devote special lessons to their\r\nconsideration.  Assign the \"questions\" to the members of the class, to\r\nbe answered on the following day, giving not more than two \"questions\"\r\nto any pupil.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n1. Name some of the restraints of home life.\r\n\r\n2. Why does the welfare of all depend upon the family government?\r\n\r\n3. Why do rights and duties always exist together?\r\n\r\n4. Name some bad habits.\r\n\r\n5. Why should children abstain from bad habits?\r\n\r\n6. What is true manhood?\r\n\r\n7. Are disobedient children apt to make good citizens?\r\n\r\n8. Should a father permit his bad habits to be adopted by his children?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE SCHOOL.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY.--When children reach the age of six or seven years, they\r\nenter the public school and become subject to its rules.  We are born\r\nunder government, and we are educated under it.  We are under it at\r\nhome, in school, and in after life.  Law and order are everywhere\r\nnecessary to the peace, safety, liberty, and' happiness of the people.\r\nTrue liberty and true enlightenment can not exist unless regulated by\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION AND PURPOSES.--A school district or sub-district is a\r\ncertain portion of the town or county laid off and set apart for the\r\npurpose of establishing and maintaining a public school.  It exists for\r\neducational reasons only, and is the unit of educational work.  The\r\npublic schools are supported by funds raised partly by the State, and\r\npartly by the county or the township.  They are frequently called\r\ncommon schools or free schools.  It is the duty of the State to provide\r\nall children with the means of acquiring a plain English education, and\r\nthe State discharges this duty by dividing the county into districts of\r\nsuch size that a school-house and a public school arc within reach of\r\nevery child.\r\n\r\nFORMATION.--The limits of the school district are usually fixed by the\r\nchief school officer of the county, by the town, by the school board,\r\nor by the people living in the neighborhood.  In most of the States\r\ndistricts vary greatly in size and shape; but in some of the States\r\nthey have a regular form, each being about two miles square.\r\n\r\nFUNCTIONS.--The functions, or work, of the school are solely\r\neducational.  The State supports a system of public schools in order\r\nthat the masses of the people may be educated.  The country needs good\r\ncitizens: to be good citizens the people must be intelligent, and to be\r\nintelligent they must attend School.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMBERS.\r\n\r\nThe members of the school district are the people living in it.  All\r\nare interested, one way or another, in the success of the school.  In\r\nmost States the legal voters elect the school board, or trustees, and\r\nin some States levy the district school taxes.  Those who are neither\r\nvoters nor within the school age are interested in the intelligence and\r\ngood name of the community, and are therefore interested in the public\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nCHILDREN.--The children within the-school age are the members of the\r\nschool, and they are the most important members of the school district.\r\nIt is for their good that the school exists.  The State has provided\r\nschools in order that its children may be educated, and thus become\r\nuseful men and women and good citizens.\r\n\r\nRIGHTS.--Children, as members of the school, have important rights and\r\nduties.  It is the right, one of the highest rights, of every child to\r\nattend the full session of the public school.  Whoever prevents him\r\nfrom exercising this right commits an offense against the child and\r\nagainst the State.  The State taxes its citizens to maintain a system\r\nof schools for the benefit of every child, and so every child has a\r\nright to all the State has provided for him.\r\n\r\nDUTIES.--As it is the right, it is also the duty of all children to\r\nattend the full session of the public school, or of some other equally\r\ngood.  They should be regular and punctual in their attendance; they\r\nshould yield prompt and cheerful obedience to the school government,\r\nand try to avail themselves of all advantages that the school can give.\r\nAs it is the duty of the State to offer a plain English education to\r\nevery child, so it is the duty of all children to make the most of all\r\nmeans the State has provided for their education.\r\n\r\nPARENTS, THEIR RIGHTS AND DUTIES.--All parents have the right to send\r\ntheir children to the public school, and it is also their duty to\r\npatronize the public school, or some other equally as good.  Fathers\r\nand mothers who deprive their children of the opportunities of\r\nacquiring an education do them lasting injury.  Parents should use\r\nevery effort to give their children at least the best education that\r\ncan be obtained in the public schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\nThe school has rules to govern it, that the pupil may be guided,\r\ndirected, and protected in the pursuit of knowledge.  Schools can not\r\nwork without order, and there can be no order without government.  The\r\nmembers of the school desire that good order be maintained, for they\r\nknow their success depends upon it; so that school, government, like\r\nall other good government, exists by the consent and for the good of\r\nthe governed.\r\n\r\nOFFICERS.--The school, like all other governments, has its officers.\r\nThese are the school board, or trustees, and the teacher.  They are\r\nresponsible for the government and good conduct of the school.  There\r\nare, in most governments, three kinds of officers, corresponding to the\r\nthree departments of government--the legislative, the judicial, and the\r\nexecutive.  The legislative department of the government makes the\r\nlaws, the judicial department explains them, and the executive\r\ndepartment executes them.  School officers are mostly executive; that\r\nis, their chief duties are to enforce the laws made by the legislature\r\nfor the government of the public schools.  As they also make rules for\r\nthe school, their duties are partly legislative.\r\n\r\nAPPOINTMENT, TERM OF OFFICE.--The district officers are usually elected\r\nby the legal voters of the school district; but in some States they are\r\nappointed by the county superintendent, or county school commissioner\r\nas he is often called.  In most States the term of office is three\r\nyears, but in some it is two years, and in others it is only one year.\r\nTrustees or directors usually receive no pay for their services.\r\n\r\nDUTIES.--In most States it is the duty of the district officers to\r\nraise money by levying taxes for the erection of school-buildings, and\r\nto superintend their construction; to purchase furniture and apparatus;\r\nto care for the school property; to employ teachers and fix their\r\nsalaries; to visit the school and direct its work; to take the school\r\ncensus; and to make reports to the higher school officers.  In some\r\nStates, as in Indiana, most of these duties belong to the office of\r\ntownship trustee.\r\n\r\nTHE TEACHER.--The teacher is usually employed by the directors or\r\ntrustees, but in some States he is employed by the township trustee or\r\nby the county superintendent.  He must first pass an examination before\r\nan examiner, or board of examiners, and obtain therefrom a certificate\r\nor license entitling him to teach in the public schools.\r\n\r\nPOWERS.--The teacher has the same power and right to govern the school\r\nthat the parent has to govern the family.  The law puts the teacher in\r\nthe parent's place and expects him to perform the parent's office,\r\nsubject to the action of the directors or trustees.  It clothes him\r\nwith all power necessary to govern the school, and then holds him\r\nresponsible for its conduct, the directors having the right to dismiss\r\nhim at any time for a failure to perform his duty.\r\n\r\nDUTIES.--The teacher is one of our most important officers.  The State\r\nhas confided to him the trust of teaching, of showing boys and girls\r\nhow to be useful men and women, of training them for citizenship.  This\r\nis a great work to do.  The State has clothed him with ample power for\r\nthe purpose, and it is his duty to serve the State faithfully and well.\r\nThe teacher should govern kindly and firmly.  Every pupil in school, of\r\nwhatever age or size, owes him cheerful and ready obedience.  It is his\r\nduty, the duty for which he is paid, to insist upon this obedience; to\r\ngovern the school; to teach the pupils to obey while they are children,\r\nin order that they may rule well when they become rulers; that is, when\r\nthey become citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n1. Why are law and order necessary to the peace and happiness of the\r\npeople?\r\n\r\n2. Why are public schools sometimes called free schools or common\r\nschools?\r\n\r\n3. About how many square miles are there in a school district in this\r\ncounty?\r\n\r\n4. What is the official title, and what the name, of the chief school\r\nofficer of this county?\r\n\r\n5. Why does the State want its people educated?\r\n\r\n6. Why should children be regular and punctual in their attendance?\r\n\r\n7. What can parents do to aid their children to acquire an education?\r\n\r\n8. What number of directors do you think would be best for the school\r\ndistrict?  Why?\r\n\r\n9. Should directors receive compensation?  How much?\r\n\r\n10. Why should the teacher pass an examination?\r\n\r\n11. Should he be examined every year?\r\n\r\n12. Why does the law place the teacher in the parent's place?\r\n\r\n13. Why are citizens said to be rulers?\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTION FOR DEBATE.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That it is right for a man without children to pay school\r\ntaxes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE CIVIL DISTRICT.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY.--In our study, thus far, we have had to do with special\r\nforms of government as exercised in the family and in the school.\r\nThese are, in a sense, peculiar to themselves.  The rights of\r\ngovernment as administered in the family, and the rights of the members\r\nof a family, as well as their duties to each other, are natural rights\r\nand duties; they do not depend upon society for their force.  In fact,\r\nthey are stronger and more binding in proportion as the bands of\r\nsociety are relaxed.\r\n\r\nIn the primitive state, before there was organized civil society,\r\nfamily government was supreme; and likewise, if a family should remove\r\nfrom within the limits of civil society and be entirely isolated,\r\nfamily government would again resume its power and binding force.\r\n\r\nSchool government, while partaking of the nature of civil government,\r\nis still more closely allied to family government.  In the natural\r\nstate, and in the isolated household, the education of the child\r\ndevolves upon the parents, and the parent delegates a part of his\r\nnatural rights and duties to the teacher when he commits the education\r\nof his child to the common school.  The teacher is said to stand _in\r\nloco parentis_ (in the place of the parent), and from this direction,\r\nmainly, are his rights of government derived.  The school, therefore,\r\nstands in an intermediate position between family government and civil\r\ngovernment proper, partaking of some features of each, and forming a\r\nsort of stepping-stone for the child from the natural restraints of\r\nhome to the more complex demands of civil society.  The school\r\ndistrict, also, while partaking of the nature of a civil institution,\r\nis in many respects to be regarded as a co-operative organization of\r\nthe families of the neighborhood for the education of their children,\r\nand its government as a co-operative family government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CIVIL UNIT DEFINED.\r\n\r\nIn nearly every part of the United States there is a unit of civil\r\nsociety in which the people exercise many of the powers of government\r\nat first hand.  This civil unit is variously named in the different\r\nStates, and its first organization may have been for some minor\r\npurpose; but it has grown to be an important sphere of government in\r\nmany States, and throughout the entire country it is the primary school\r\nof the citizen and the voter.\r\n\r\nThere are many different names by which this civil unit is known.\r\n\r\nIn the State of Mississippi it is called the _Beat_, and this name is\r\nno doubt derived from the original purpose of the organization, as the\r\njurisdiction of a watchman or constable.\r\n\r\nIn Delaware it is called the _Hundred_, which is the old English\r\nsubdivision of a county, supposed to contain one hundred families, or\r\none hundred men able to bear arms in the public service.\r\n\r\nIn the New England States, in New York, and in Wisconsin it is called\r\nthe _Town_, from the old Anglo-Saxon civil unit, which antedates the\r\nsettlement of England by its Saxon invaders, and is probably older than\r\nthe Christian era.\r\n\r\nIn Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri,\r\nMontana, New Jersey, the Carolinas, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and parts of\r\nIllinois, Nebraska, and the Dakotas, it is called the _Township_, only\r\na variation of name from the \"town,\" and having the same origin.\r\n\r\nIn California it is called the _Judicial Township_, and in parts of the\r\nDakotas it is called the _School Township_.\r\n\r\nIn Alabama, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and\r\nparts of Illinois and Nebraska, it is called the _Election Precinct_,\r\nfrom the fact that it was the subdivision made for the convenience of\r\nvoters.\r\n\r\nIn Georgia it is called the _Militia District_, from the fact that each\r\nsubdivision furnished a certain proportionate number of men for the\r\nmilitia service of the State.\r\n\r\nIn Kentucky, Virginia, and West Virginia, it is called the _Magisterial\r\nDistrict_, from the fact that it was constituted as the limit of the\r\njurisdiction of a local magistrate.\r\n\r\nIn Louisiana it is called the _Police Jury Ward_, perhaps for the\r\nreason that from each one of these subdivisions a warden was elected to\r\nadminister the parish government.\r\n\r\nIn Maryland and Wyoming it is called the _Election District_, from the\r\nfact that it was the subdivision made for the convenience of voters.\r\n\r\nIn Tennessee it is called the _Civil District_--probably, next to\r\n\"town\" or \"township,\" the most fitting name for the smallest\r\nsubdivision of civil government.\r\n\r\nIn Texas it is called the _Justice's Precinct_, as being the limit of a\r\njustice's jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nIn some of the New England States, also, districts which have not the\r\nentire town organization are provisionally called _Plantations_ or\r\n_Grants_, being subject to the administration, in some local affairs,\r\nof other towns.\r\n\r\nBut under whatever name the civil unit may exist, it is the primary\r\nseat of government.  In many cases the original reason for the name has\r\ndisappeared, while the character of the government has greatly changed,\r\nand been modified and developed from the first crude forms.\r\n\r\nTHREE GENERAL CLASSES.--As a result, there are at present but three\r\ngeneral classes into which we need subdivide the civil unit in the\r\nvarious States: these are the _Civil District_, which would include the\r\n\"Beat,\" \"Hundred,\" \"Election Precinct,\" \"Militia District,\" and\r\nnumerous other classes, embracing about one half the States of the\r\nUnion; the _Town_, which has its fullest development in the New England\r\nStates; and the _Township_, which in some States has nearly the full\r\ndevelopment of a New England town, while in other States it has a\r\nlooser organisation, approximating the civil district of the Southern\r\nand Southwestern States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CIVIL DISTRICT, PROPER.\r\n\r\nWe shall treat of the various forms of the civil unit which we have\r\nclassed under the general name of civil district before we speak of the\r\ntown and the township, because they are simpler and much less\r\ndeveloped, and therefore naturally constitute the simplest form of the\r\ncivil unit.\r\n\r\nNUMBER, SIZE.--In number and size, civil districts vary widely in\r\ndifferent States and in different counties of the same State.  There\r\nare rarely less than five or more than twelve districts to the county.\r\n\r\nPURPOSES.--The division of the county into districts, each with its own\r\ncourt of law, brings justice to the people's doors.  It secures\r\nofficers to every part of the county, thus affording better means for\r\nthe punishment of crimes.  It provides a speedy trial for minor\r\noffences and minor suits.  It aids the higher courts by relieving them\r\nof a multitude of small cases.  As each district has one or more\r\npolling-places, it secures convenience to the electors in casting their\r\nvotes.\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT.--The functions of the civil district arc judicial and\r\nexecutive, and lie within a narrow range.  Its government possesses no\r\nlegislative or corporate power whatever; it can not make a single law,\r\nhowever unimportant.  Within a narrow jurisdiction or sphere, it\r\napplies the law to particular cases, and this is the chief purpose for\r\nits existence.  Whenever the civil unit possesses more powers than are\r\nherein set forth, it is more properly described under the township in\r\nthe next chapter, no matter what name it may go by locally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCITIZENS.\r\n\r\nThe citizens of the civil district are the people residing within it.\r\nIt exists for their benefit, that they may be secure in life, liberty,\r\nand property.  In a certain sense they constitute the district, since\r\nits government concerns them directly, and others only remotely.\r\n\r\nRIGHTS.--All citizens have a right to the full and equal protection of\r\nthe laws.  Each has a right to be secure in his person and property; to\r\ndemand that the peace be preserved; to do all things according to his\r\nown will, provided he does not trespass upon the rights of others.  No\r\none in the family, in the school, in the civil district, in the county,\r\nin the State, or in the nation, has the right to do or say any thing\r\nwhich interferes with the life, liberty, property, or happiness of\r\nanother.  Any act which interferes with the rights of others is an\r\noffence against the common good and against the law.  It is chiefly for\r\nthe prevention and punishment of these unlawful acts that the civil\r\ndistrict exists, with its court and its officers.\r\n\r\nAll legal voters of the district have the right to participate in its\r\ngovernment by exercising a free choice in the selection of its\r\nofficers, except in States where these officers are appointed.  They\r\nhave the right to cast their votes without fear or favor.  This is one\r\nof the most important and sacred rights that freemen possess.  Free\r\ngovernment can not exist without it.  The law guarantees it, and all\r\nthe power of the State may be employed to maintain it.  Therefore,\r\nwhoever prevents a voter from exercising the right of suffrage does it\r\nat his own peril.\r\n\r\nDUTIES.--As the citizens of the civil district have rights, they also\r\nhave corresponding duties.  As they may demand protection and the\r\npreservation of the peace, so it is their duty to obey the law and\r\nassist the officers in its enforcement, in order that the same\r\nprotection may be extended to the whole people.  Each should abstain\r\nfrom acts that injure others, and render cheerful aid to all in\r\nsecuring their rights through the law.\r\n\r\nAll qualified voters have the right, and it is also their duty, to\r\nvote.  The voters elect the officers of the district, and are therefore\r\nits rulers.  When they fail to vote, they fail to rule--fail in their\r\nduty to the people and to themselves.  The duty to vote implies the\r\nduty to vote right, to vote for good men and for good measures.\r\nTherefore, citizens should study their duty as voters, that they may\r\nelect honest, capable, faithful officers, and support the parties and\r\nprinciples that will best promote the good of the country?  Every one\r\nshould study his political duty with the best light that he can obtain,\r\ndecide what is right, and then vote his sentiments honestly and\r\nfearlessly.  If the district has good government, the voters deserve\r\nthe credit; if it has bad government, the voters deserve the blame.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOFFICERS.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the district are the justices of the peace and the\r\nconstable.  In some States there is only one justice to each district,\r\nin other States there are two, and in others there are three.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE OF THE PEACE.--The office of justice of the peace is one of\r\ndignity and importance.  Justices can render great service to society\r\nby the proper discharge of their duties.  They may have much to do with\r\nenforcing the law, and therefore the best men should be elected to this\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nELECTION, TERM OF OFFICE.--Justices of the peace are usually elected by\r\nthe qualified voters of the district.  In some States the governor\r\nappoints them.  The term of office is two, three, four, or even seven\r\nyears, varying in different States.\r\n\r\nDUTIES.--The duties of justices of the peace are principally judicial,\r\nand their jurisdiction extends throughout the county.  Upon the sworn\r\nstatement of the person making complaint, they issue warrants for the\r\narrest of offenders.  With the aid of juries, they hold court for the\r\ntrial of minor offences--such as the breach of the peace--punishable by\r\nfine or brief imprisonment.  They sometimes try those charged with\r\nhigher crimes, and acquit; or, if the proof is sufficient, remand the\r\naccused to trial by a higher court.  This is called an examining trial.\r\nThey try civil suits where the amount involved does not exceed a fixed\r\namount--fifty dollars in some States, and one hundred dollars in\r\nothers--and prevent crime by requiring reckless persons to give\r\nsecurity to keep the peace.  Justices sometimes preside, instead of the\r\ncoroner, at inquests, and in some States they have important duties as\r\nofficers of the county.\r\n\r\nCONSTABLE, ELECTION, TERM OF OFFICE.--There is usually one\r\nconstable--in some States more--in each civil district.  Constables,\r\nlike the justices, are elected in most States; but in some they are\r\nappointed.  The term of office is usually the same as that of the\r\njustice in the same State.\r\n\r\nDUTIES.--The constable is termed a ministerial officer because it is\r\nhis duty to minister to, or wait upon, the justice's court.  He serves\r\nwarrants, writs, and other processes of the justice, and sometimes\r\nthose of higher courts.  He preserves the public peace, makes arrests\r\nfor its violation, and in some States collects the taxes apportioned to\r\nhis civil district.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n1. In what respect does civil government differ from family or school\r\ngovernment?\r\n\r\n2. Why does the government of the civil district concern its people\r\ndirectly and others remotely?\r\n\r\n3. What is meant by the civil unit?  By what names is it known in the\r\nvarious States?\r\n\r\n4. What are the three general classes under which the civil unit may be\r\nconsidered?\r\n\r\n5. Why can not free government exist without the right to vote?\r\n\r\n6. Why should the people try to secure their rights through the law?\r\n\r\n7. What is the purpose of the subdivision of a county into districts?\r\n\r\n8. Define in general terms the rights and duties of the citizens of\r\ncivil districts.\r\n\r\n9. By what other names are justices of the peace sometimes called?\r\n\r\n10. Why is the jurisdiction of a justice's court limited?\r\n\r\n11. Who are the justices of this civil district?\r\n\r\n12. When elected, and what is their term of office?\r\n\r\n13. Who is constable of this district?\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTION FOR DEBATE.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the government of the civil district should have a\r\nlegislative department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE TOWNSHIP OR TOWN.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.--We have learned that in the Southern States the civil\r\nunit under various names may be described under the common name of the\r\ncivil district; that in the New England States it is called the town,\r\nand in many of the Western States it is known as the township.  As the\r\npowers and functions of the town and the township are the same in kind,\r\ndiffering only in extent, and as the two names are so often used, the\r\none for the other, we shall consider both under the head of the\r\ntownship.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the township possesses more extensive governmental functions\r\nin the Eastern than in the Western States, and in the West it possesses\r\nfunctions much more extensive than those of the civil district in the\r\nSouth.  Many of the most important powers that belong to the county in\r\nthe Southern States belong to the township in the Eastern and the\r\nWestern States.\r\n\r\nFORMATION.--In the Eastern States the townships were formed in the\r\nfirst settlement of the country, and afterward a number of townships\r\nwere combined to form the county.  In the Western States the townships\r\nwere surveyed, and their boundaries marked, by agents of the general\r\ngovernment, before the Territories became States of the Union.  As a\r\nnatural result, the townships of the Eastern States are irregular in\r\nshape and size, while those of the Western States have a regular form,\r\neach being about six miles square.  In the Western States the township\r\nis usually composed of thirty-six sections, each section being one mile\r\nsquare, and containing six hundred and forty acres of land.\r\n\r\nPURPOSES.--It is an old and true maxim that government should be\r\nbrought as near the people as possible.  This the township system does.\r\nIn our country all power resides in the people, and the township\r\nprovides a convenient means of ascertaining their wishes and of\r\nexecuting their will.  The farther away the government, the less will\r\nbe the people's power; the nearer the government, the greater will be\r\nthe people's power.  The township system enables each community to\r\nattend to its own local affairs--a work which no other agency can do so\r\nwell--to remove readily and speedily its local public grievances, and\r\nto obtain readily and speedily its local public needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCITIZENS.\r\n\r\nThe citizens of the township are the people living in it, whether\r\nnative or foreigners who have become citizens.  It exists for their\r\nbenefit, to afford them a means of securing their rights and of\r\nredressing their wrongs.  It is these persons that the law has in view\r\nwhen setting forth the privileges and immunities of citizenship.\r\n\r\nRIGHTS.--All citizens of the township arc entitled to enjoy the rights\r\nof \"life, liberty, property, and the pursuit of happiness.\"  The\r\ntownship government exists for the purpose of securing these rights to\r\nthe people.  All have equal claims to the fullest protection of the\r\nlaw.  They may use their own property as they choose, and do whatever\r\npleases them, so long as they do not interfere with the rights of\r\nothers.  Whenever one's act, speech, or property interferes with the\r\nrights of others, he falls under the censure of the law and becomes\r\nsubject to its penalty.\r\n\r\nAll male inhabitants born in the United States, and foreigners who have\r\nbecome citizens, who have resided within the State, county, and\r\ntownship the time required by law, are entitled to vote at all\r\ntownship, county, state, and national elections.  Several States\r\nrequire ability to read, or the payment of poll-tax, as a qualification\r\nto vote; a few permit the subjects of foreign countries to vote; and in\r\nsome States women are permitted to vote in school elections or in all\r\nelections.  Lunatics, idiots, paupers, and persons convicted of certain\r\nhigh crimes are disfranchised; that is, are not permitted to vote.  The\r\nright of suffrage is one of great power and value, being the basis of\r\nall free government, and is jealously guarded by the laws of the land.\r\n\r\nDUTIES.--The people have extensive rights and they have equally\r\nextensive duties.  Each citizen has rights that others must respect.\r\nIt is the duty of each to observe and regard the rights of all other\r\npersons; and when he does not, the law interferes by its officers and\r\ndeprives him of his own rights by fine or imprisonment, and in some\r\ninstances by a still more severe penalty.  It is the duty of the people\r\nto love and serve the country; to be good citizens; to labor for the\r\npublic good; to obey the law, and to assist the officers in its\r\nenforcement.\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of the qualified voters to give the township good\r\ngovernment by electing good officers.  A vote cast for a bad man or a\r\nbad measure is an attack upon the rights of every person in the\r\ncommunity.  The power of suffrage is held for the public good; but it\r\nis used for the public injury when incompetent or unfaithful men are\r\nelected to office.  Good government and the happiness and prosperity of\r\nthe country depend upon an honest and intelligent vote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\nThe township government possesses legislative, judicial, and executive\r\nfunctions.  It has a legislative department to make local laws, a\r\njudicial department to apply the laws to particular cases, and an\r\nexecutive department to enforce these and other laws.  The three\r\nfunctions are of nearly equal prominence in the Eastern States, but in\r\nthe West the executive function is more prominent than the legislative\r\nand the judicial.\r\n\r\nCORPORATE POWER.--Each township is a corporation; that is, in any\r\nbusiness affair it may act as a single person.  In its corporate\r\ncapacity it can sue and be sued; borrow money; buy, rent, and sell\r\nproperty for public purposes.  When it is said that the township\r\npossesses these powers, it is meant that the people of the township,\r\nacting as a single political body, possess them.\r\n\r\nOFFICERS.--The officers of the township are more numerous, and their\r\nfunctions are more extensive than those of the civil district.  Many\r\nofficers are the same in name, and others have the same duties as those\r\nof the county in the Southern States.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE DEPARTMENT; THE PEOPLE.--In the Eastern States the\r\nlegislative department of the township government has more extensive\r\nfunctions than in the West.  In the New England States most local\r\naffairs belong to the township government, and the county is of minor\r\nimportance.  In these and a few other States the people make their own\r\nlocal laws instead of delegating this power to representatives.  The\r\nelectors of the township meet annually at a fixed place, upon a day\r\nappointed by law, discuss questions of public concern, elect the\r\ntownship officers, levy township taxes, make appropriations of money\r\nfor public purposes, fix the salaries and hear the reports of officers,\r\nand decide upon a course of action for the coming year.  Thus the\r\npeople themselves, or more strictly speaking, the qualified voters, are\r\nthe government.  In some States special town meetings may be called for\r\nspecial purposes.  The town meeting places local public affairs under\r\nthe direct control of the people, and thus gives them a personal\r\ninterest in the government, and makes them feel a personal\r\nresponsibility for its acts.  Another benefit of the system is that it\r\ntrains the people to deal with political matters, and so prepares them\r\nto act intelligently in all the affairs of the State and the nation.\r\n\r\nIn the Western States the county government is more important, and\r\ntownship legislation is confined to a narrow range.  In power and\r\nimportance the township of most Western States is intermediate between\r\nthe town of the East and the civil district of the South.\r\n\r\nSELECTMEN OR TRUSTEES.--The legislative power of the township is vested\r\nin the trustees, town council, or selectmen, as they are variously\r\ntermed.  The number of trustees or selectmen is not the same in all\r\nparts of the Union, being fixed at three in most States of the West,\r\nand varying in New England with the wishes of the electors.  The\r\ntrustees, councilmen, or selectmen are elected by the qualified voters\r\nof the township for a term of one, two, or three years, varying in\r\ndifferent States.  They are the legal guardians of the public interests\r\nof the township, and make laws or ordinances, sometimes called by-laws,\r\nexpressly pertaining to the local wants of the community, and to a\r\nlimited extent may levy taxes.\r\n\r\nIn some States, especially those of the East, the principal duties of\r\nthe trustees or selectmen are executive.  They divide the township into\r\nroad districts; open roads on petition; select jurors; build and repair\r\nbridges and town halls, where the expenditure is small; act as judges\r\nof elections; purchase and care for cemeteries; have charge of the poor\r\nnot in the county charge; and act for the township in its corporate\r\ncapacity.  If any thing goes wrong in the public affairs of the town,\r\ncomplaint is made to these officers.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT.--Most of the public affairs of the township, as\r\nwell as of all other governments, pertain to the executive department.\r\nIts duties are far more extensive, and its officers are more numerous,\r\nthan those of the other departments.  The executive officers of the\r\ntownship are the clerk, the treasurer, the school directors, the\r\nassessor, the supervisors, and the constables.  In most States all\r\nthese officers are elected by the qualified voters; but in some the\r\nclerk, the treasurer, and the constables are elected by the town\r\ncouncil.\r\n\r\nCLERK.--The clerk of the township is clerk of the trustees, council, or\r\nselectmen, and in some States of the school board.  He attends the\r\nmeetings of the trustees, and makes a careful record of the\r\nproceedings.  He keeps the poll-lists and other legal papers of the\r\ntownship, administers oaths, and notifies officers of their election.\r\nIn the New England States, and some others, he keeps a record of the\r\nmarriages, births, and deaths, calls the town meeting to order, reads\r\nthe warrant under which it is held, presides until a moderator is\r\nchosen, and then acts as clerk of the meeting.\r\n\r\nTREASURER.--Taxes collected from the people for local purposes are paid\r\nto the treasurer.  He receives all fines, forfeitures, and license-fees\r\npaid to the township.  He is the keeper of the township funds, giving\r\nbond for the faithful performance of his duties, and pays out money\r\nupon the written order of the trustees, attested by the clerk.  In some\r\nStates, as in New York, there is no separate township treasurer, the\r\nabove and other duties being performed by the supervisor, who is the\r\nchief officer of the township.\r\n\r\nSCHOOL DIRECTORS.--The school directors have charge of the public\r\nschools of the township.  The number of directors varies widely, being\r\nusually three, five, or more.  In a few of the States, the clerks of\r\nthe district trustees constitute the township school directors, or\r\ntownship board of education.  The directors levy taxes for school\r\npurposes, visit and inspect the public schools, adopt text-books,\r\nregulate the order of studies and length of the term, fix salaries,\r\npurchase furniture and apparatus, and make reports to the higher school\r\nofficers.  In some States they examine teachers and grant certificates\r\nto teach.  In many States a part of these duties falls to the county\r\nsuperintendent.\r\n\r\nASSESSOR.--The assessor makes a list of the names of all persons\r\nsubject to taxation, estimates the value of their real and personal\r\nproperty, assesses a tax thereon, and in some States delivers this list\r\nto the auditor, and in others to the collector of taxes.  In most\r\nStates there, is also a poll-tax of from one to three dollars,\r\nsometimes more, laid upon all male inhabitants more than twenty-one\r\nyears of age.  In some States there are two or more assessors to the\r\ntownship, and in others real estate is valued only once in ten years.\r\n\r\nCOMMISSIONERS, or surveyors of highways, have charge of the\r\nconstruction and repair of highways, summon those subject to labor on\r\nthe road, and direct their work.\r\n\r\nSUPERVISOR.--In some States the chief executive duties of the town fall\r\nupon the supervisor, but his principal duties are rather as a member of\r\nthe county board of supervisors.\r\n\r\nCONSTABLES.--Constables are ministerial and police officers.  There are\r\nusually two or three in each township.  They wait upon the justice's\r\ncourt, and are subject to his orders.  They preserve the public peace,\r\nserve warrants and other processes, and in some States act as\r\ncollectors of taxes.\r\n\r\nCOLLECTOR, ETC.--In some States the township has a collector and three\r\nor more auditors.  They are usually elected by the trustees, or\r\ncouncil, but in a few of the States they are elected by the town\r\nmeeting.  The collector collects the township taxes, giving bond for\r\nthe faithful performance of his duties.  In order to secure honesty and\r\nefficiency in public office, and to exhibit the financial condition of\r\nthe township, the auditors annually examine the books of the treasurer\r\nand the collector, and publish a report showing the receipts and\r\nexpenditures of public money.\r\n\r\nIn a few States the township has a field-driver and a pound-keeper,\r\nwhose respective duties are to take stray animals to the pound, an\r\nenclosure kept for the purpose, and to retain them with good care until\r\nthe owner is notified and pays all expenses; two or more fence-viewers,\r\nwho decide disputes about fences; surveyors of lumber, who measure and\r\nmark lumber offered for sale; and sealers, who test and certify weights\r\nand measures used in trade.  These officers are usually appointed by\r\nthe selectmen.\r\n\r\nJUDICIAL DEPARTMENT; JUSTICES.--The judicial power is vested in the\r\njustices, who are elected by the qualified voters of the town.  There\r\nare usually two or three justices, but in some States there is only one\r\nin each township.  The term of office is one, two, three, four, or more\r\nyears, varying in different States.  Justices preside in the justice's\r\ncourt to hear and determine suits at law.  \"This is the humblest court\r\nin the land, the court of greatest antiquity, and the court upon which\r\nall other courts are founded.\"[1]  The justice's court tries petty\r\noffences and civil suits for small amounts.  In some States the\r\njustices preside at the town meetings, and in others they perform the\r\nduties of coroner in the township.\r\n\r\n[1]Thorpe's _Civil Government_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n1.

It bears the name of\r\ncounty in all parts of the country except in Louisiana, where a similar\r\norganization is known as a parish.  In New England the county has less\r\npower than the town; in the Western States it has more than the\r\ntownship; and in the Southern States it has far more than the civil\r\ndistrict, being there the unit of political influence.\r\n\r\nPURPOSES.--The county organization brings justice near the people,\r\nenables them to attend to local affairs too extensive for a smaller\r\ncommunity, and affords a medium by which they may transact business\r\nwith the State.  It serves as a convenient basis of apportioning\r\nmembers of the legislature among the people.  It maintains local\r\nofficers, such as sheriff and prosecuting attorney, whose duties would\r\nbe too narrow if confined to a township.  It secures a competent and\r\nhigher tribunal than the justice's court for the trial of suits at law.\r\nThis was the original purpose, and is still the controlling reason for\r\nthe division of the States into counties.\r\n\r\nFORMATION, AREA.--Counties are formed, their rights are conferred, and\r\ntheir duties imposed, by act of the State legislature.  In most States\r\ncounties vary greatly in shape and size, but in some of the Western\r\nStates they have a regular form.  The average area of counties in the\r\nUnited States is eight hundred and thirty square miles; the average\r\narea of those east of the Mississippi River is only three hundred and\r\neighty square miles.\r\n\r\nCOUNTY SEAT.--The county government resides at the county seat, county\r\ntown, or shire town, as it is variously called.  The court-house, the\r\njail, the public offices, and sometimes other county buildings are\r\nlocated at the county seat.  Here are kept the records of the courts;\r\nalso, usually copies of the deeds, wills, mortgages, and other\r\nimportant papers of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNTY GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\nThe county, like the United States, the State, and the township, has a\r\nrepublican form of government; that is, it is governed by\r\nrepresentatives elected by the people.  In nearly all States the county\r\ngovernment has three departments, legislative, executive, and judicial;\r\nbut the functions of making, of executing, and of explaining the laws,\r\nare not always kept separate and distinct.  In a few States the county\r\ndoes not have a judicial department.\r\n\r\nOFFICERS.--County officers and township officers have duties similar in\r\nkind, but the former have charge of the larger interests.  The usual\r\nofficers of the county are the commissioners or supervisors, the county\r\nattorney or prosecuting attorney, the county superintendent of schools\r\nor school commissioner, the sheriff, the treasurer, the auditor, the\r\ncounty clerk or common pleas clerk, the surveyor, the coroner, and the\r\ncounty judge and surrogate, or probate judge.  In the counties of many\r\nStates one or more of these officers are lacking, and others have\r\ndifferent names from those here given.  In the Western and the Southern\r\nStates county officers are elected by the direct vote of the people; in\r\nmost of the New England States some of them are chosen in other ways.\r\nThe terms of county officers vary in different parts of the Union,\r\nbeing usually two, three, or four years; but in some States certain\r\nofficers are elected for a longer term.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE DEPARTMENT: COUNTY COMMISSIONERS, OR BOARD OF\r\nSUPERVISORS.--In most States the public interests of the county are\r\nintrusted to a board of officers, three or five in number, called\r\ncounty commissioners.  In some States the board consists of one or more\r\nsupervisors from each township, and is called the board of supervisors.\r\nIn a few States the board consists of all the justices of the county,\r\nwith the county judge as presiding officer.\r\n\r\nThe county commissioners, or board of supervisors, have charge of the\r\ncounty property, such as the court-house, the jail, and the county\r\ninfirmary; make orders and raise funds for the erection of county\r\nbuildings, and for the construction and improvement of highways and\r\nbridges; provide polling-places; make appropriations of money for\r\npublic purposes; and act as the chief agents of the county in its\r\ncorporate capacity.  In some States they fix the salaries of county\r\nofficers; in others they have power to form new townships and to change\r\nthe township boundaries.  In several States the functions of the board\r\nare almost wholly executive.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT: COUNTY ATTORNEYS, OR PROSECUTIN ATTORNEYS.--The\r\ncounty attorney, or prosecuting attorney, is the county's counsellor at\r\nlaw, and when requested gives legal advice to all the county officers.\r\nIt is his duty to prosecute the accused in the trial of crimes and\r\noffences, in the justice's court, the county court, and in some States\r\nin the circuit court or district court; to represent the county in all\r\ncivil suits to which it is a party; and to act for it in all cases in\r\nwhich its legal interests are involved.\r\n\r\nCOUNTY SUPERINDENTENT OF SCHOOLS.--In some States there is no county\r\nsuperintendent of schools.  In most States there is such an officer\r\nelected by the township school directors or by the people of the\r\ncounty, or appointed by the State superintendent of public instruction.\r\nIn a few States the county is divided into two or more districts, each\r\nhaving a commissioner of schools.\r\n\r\nThe county superintendent, or school commissioner, is the chief school\r\nofficer of the county.  He administers the public school system,\r\ncondemns unfit school-houses and orders others built, examines teachers\r\nand grants certificates, holds teachers' institutes, visits and directs\r\nthe schools, instructs teachers in their duties, interests the people\r\nin education, and reports the condition of the schools to the State\r\nsuperintendent of public instruction.  He is one of the most important\r\nofficers of the county, a capable administration of his duties being of\r\nthe greatest benefit to the whole people.\r\n\r\nSHERIFF.--\"The sheriff is the guardian of the peace of the county and\r\nthe executive officer of its courts.\"[1]  He preserves the peace,\r\narrests persons charged with crime, serves writs and other processes in\r\nboth civil and criminal cases, makes proclamation of all elections,\r\nsummons jurors, and ministers to the courts of his county.  In States\r\nhaving no county jailer, the sheriff has charge of the prisons and\r\nprisoners, and is responsible for their safe-keeping.  When persons\r\nrefuse to pay their taxes, he seizes and sells enough property to pay\r\nthe sum assessed; and in some States he is the collector of all State\r\nand county revenue.\r\n\r\nCOUNTY TREASURER.--The duties of the treasurer are indicated by the\r\ntitle of his office.  He receives all county taxes, licenses, and other\r\nmoney paid into the county treasury.  In most States he is custodian of\r\nthe county's financial records, and of the tax-collector's books, and\r\nin others he collects all the taxes assessed in the county.  He gives\r\nbond for the faithful performance of his duties, and pays out funds\r\nupon the warrant of the county commissioners.  In most States having no\r\ncounty treasurer, the sheriff is keeper of the public money.\r\n\r\nAUDITOR.--The auditor is the guardian of the county's financial\r\ninterests.  He examines the books and papers of officers who receive or\r\ndisburse county funds; keeps a record of receipts and expenditures;\r\ndraws all warrants for the payment of public money; and publishes a\r\nreport of the county's financial transactions.  In some States he\r\nreceives the assessor's returns, apportions taxes among the people, and\r\nprepares the tax-collector's duplicate list.  In States having no\r\ncounty auditor, these duties are performed by other officers.\r\n\r\nCOUNTY CLERK, OR COMMON PLEAS CLERK.--The county clerk, or common pleas\r\nclerk, is the recording officer of the county court, or probate court,\r\nand in some States of the circuit court.  He issues writs, preserves\r\npapers, and records judgments.  In many States he issues licenses,\r\npreserves election returns, and records wills, deeds, mortgages, and\r\nother important papers.\r\n\r\nRECORDER, OR REGISTER.--In many States the county has a recorder, or\r\nregister, instead of the county clerk, and in some States it has both.\r\nThe recorder, or register, makes a record in books kept for that\r\npurpose, of wills, deeds, mortgages, village plats, and powers of\r\nattorney.  Some of these instruments must be recorded in order to make\r\nthem valid in law.  In some States having no recorder, these duties are\r\nperformed by the township clerk, and in others by the county clerk.\r\n\r\nSURVEYOR.--The county surveyor, or engineer, surveys tracts of land to\r\nlocate lines, determine areas, and to settle conflicting claims.  In\r\nsome States his services are frequently needed in the transfer of real\r\nestate.  In most States he makes plots of surveys, issues maps of the\r\ncounty, and has charge of the construction of roads and bridges.\r\n\r\nCORONER.--The coroner investigates the death of persons who have died\r\nby violence, or in prison, or from causes unknown.  He receives notice\r\nof the death; a jury is summoned; witnesses testify; and the jury\r\nrenders a verdict in writing, stating the cause and the manner of the\r\ndeath.  This inquiry is known as the coroner's inquest.  In some States\r\nwhen the office of sheriff is vacant, the coroner performs the duties.\r\n\r\nOTHER OFFICERS.--In some States there are superintendents of the poor,\r\nor infirmary directors, who have charge of the county infirmary in\r\nwhich the dependent poor are maintained; in others the township\r\noverseers of the poor support these unfortunates with funds furnished\r\nfor that purpose by the county.  In some States there is a collector\r\nwho collects all the taxes of the county; a county jailer who holds\r\nprisoners in custody and has charge of the county buildings, under the\r\ncommissioners' directions; and also a circuit clerk, or district clerk,\r\nwho is the recording officer of the circuit court, or district court as\r\nit is often called.\r\n\r\nJUDICIAL DEPARTMENT: COUNTY JUDGE OR PROBATE JUDGE.--The judicial power\r\nof the county is vested in the county judge, or probate judge, who in\r\nmany States is its most prominent and important officer.  He has\r\njurisdiction of wills and estates, appoints administrators and\r\nguardians, and settles their accounts.  In many states he grants\r\nlicenses; presides over the legislative body of the county; makes\r\norders opening roads and appointing overseers of the public highway:\r\nappoints officers of elections; holds examining trials; sits in the\r\ncounty court to try minor offences and civil suits for small amounts;\r\nand in a few States acts as county superintendent of schools.\r\n\r\nIn some States there is a probate judge, or judge of the orphan's\r\ncourt, in addition to the county judge.\r\n\r\n[1]Thorpe's _Civil Government_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n1. What is meant by unit of political influence?\r\n\r\n2. What affairs are too extensive for a smaller community than the\r\ncounty?\r\n\r\n3. Why is the county seat so called?\r\n\r\n4. State the terms and the names of the officers of this county.\r\n\r\n5. Why do the officers of the county need legal advice?\r\n\r\n6.

Do you think the county judge or probate judge should act as\r\nsuperintendent of schools?  Why?\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTION FOR DEBATE.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That a poll-tax is unjust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nMUNICIPAL CORPORATIONS.\r\n\r\nVILLAGES, BOROUGHS, AND CITIES.--The county usually has within its\r\nlimits villages or cities, organized under separate and distinct\r\ngovernments.  When the people become so thickly settled that the\r\ntownship and county government do not meet their local public wants,\r\nthe community is incorporated as a village.  Villages are often called\r\ntowns, and incorporated as such, especially in the Southern States; but\r\nthe word taken in this sense must not be confounded with the same word,\r\ndenoting a political division of the county in New England, New York,\r\nand Wisconsin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VILLAGE, OR BOROUGH.\r\n\r\nINCORPORATION.--In most States, villages, boroughs, and towns are\r\nincorporated under general laws made by the State legislature.  A\r\nmajority of the legal voters living within the proposed limits must\r\nfirst vote in favor of the proposition to incorporate.  In some States,\r\nvillages are incorporated by special act of the legislature.\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT PURPOSES.--The purposes of the village or borough government\r\nare few in number, and lie within a narrow limit.  It is a corporate\r\nbody, having the usual corporate powers.  Under the village\r\norganization, local public works, such as streets, sidewalks, and\r\nbridges, are maintained more readily and in better condition than under\r\nthe government, of the township and county.  The presence of the\r\nvillage officers tends to preserve the peace and make crime less\r\nfrequent.\r\n\r\nOFFICERS.--The usual officers of the village or borough are the\r\ntrustees or councilmen, whose duties are mostly legislative; the\r\nmarshal, and sometimes a president or mayor; a collector and a\r\ntreasurer, whose duties are executive; and the recorder, or police\r\njudge, or justices of the peace, whose duties are judicial.  The\r\nofficers are usually elected by the legal voters, and serve for a term\r\nof one or two years.  In many villages the president and the collector\r\nare elected by the trustees, the former from among their own number.\r\n\r\nDUTIES.--The trustees or council pass laws, called _ordinances_,\r\nrelating to streets, fast driving, lamps, water-works, the police\r\nsystem, public parks, public health, and the public buildings.  They\r\nappoint minor officers, such as clerk, regular and special policemen,\r\nkeeper of the cemetery, and fire-wardens; prescribe the duties, and fix\r\nthe compensation of these officers.\r\n\r\nThe president or mayor is the chief executive officer, and is charged\r\nwith seeing that the laws are enforced.  In villages having no\r\npresident or mayor, this duty devolves upon the trustees.  The marshal\r\nis a ministerial officer, with the same duties and often the same\r\njurisdiction as the constable, and is sometimes known by that name.  He\r\npreserves the peace, makes arrests, serves processes, and waits upon\r\nthe recorder's court.  The collector collects the village taxes.  The\r\ntreasurer receives all village funds, and pays out money upon the order\r\nof the trustees.\r\n\r\nThe recorder or police judge tries minor offences, such as breach of\r\nthe peace, and holds examining trials of higher crimes.  His\r\njurisdiction is usually equal to that of justices of the peace in the\r\nsame State.  In some States the village has two justices of the peace\r\ninstead of the recorder, these being also officers of the county.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CITY.\r\n\r\nWhen the village, borough, or town becomes so large that its government\r\ndoes not meet the people's local public needs, it is incorporated as a\r\ncity.  Where the country is sparsely settled the peace is seldom\r\nbroken, private interests do not conflict, the people's public needs\r\nare small, and therefore the functions of government are few and light.\r\nAs the population grows dense, the public peace is oftener disturbed,\r\ncrime increases, disputes about property arise, the public needs become\r\nnumerous and important, and the officers of the law must interfere to\r\npreserve order and protect the people.  The fewer the people to the\r\nsquare mile, the fewer and lighter are the functions of government; the\r\nmore people to the square mile, the more and stronger must be the\r\nfunctions of government.\r\n\r\nINCORPORATION.--Cities and villages or boroughs differ principally in\r\nsize and in the scope of their corporate authority.  A city is larger\r\nin area and population, and the powers and privileges of its government\r\nare more extensive.  In most States cities may be incorporated under\r\ngeneral laws, but some cities are incorporated by special acts of the\r\nState legislature.  The act or deed of incorporation is called the city\r\ncharter.  The charter names the city, fixes its limits, erects it as a\r\ndistinct political corporation, sets forth its powers and privileges,\r\nnames its officers, prescribes their duties, and authorizes the city to\r\nact as an independent government.  The legislature may amend the\r\ncharter at any time, and the acts and laws of the city must not\r\nconflict with the constitution of the State or of the United States.\r\n\r\nWARDS.--The city is usually divided into wards for convenience in\r\nexecuting the laws, and especially in electing representatives in the\r\ncity government.  Wards vary greatly in area and population, and their\r\nnumber depends in a measure upon the size of the city.  Each usually\r\nelects a member of the board of education, and one or more members of\r\neach branch of the city council.  Each ward is subdivided into\r\nprecincts for convenience in establishing polling-places.\r\n\r\nCITY INSTITUTIONS.--Cities maintain a number of institutions, peculiar\r\nto themselves, for the public welfare.  The frequency of destructive\r\nfires causes the formation of a fire department.  A police force must\r\nbe organized to protect life and property.  A system of sewerage is\r\nnecessary to the public health.  There must be gas-works or\r\nelectric-light works, that the streets may be lighted, and water-works\r\nto supply water for public and private use.  In many cities gas-works\r\nand water-works are operated by private parties or by private\r\ncorporations.\r\n\r\nFINANCES.--Each city has an independent financial system, which\r\nrequires skillful management.  The city borrows money, issuing\r\ninterest-bearing bonds in payment, and engages in extensive public\r\nimprovements.  The large outlays for paving the streets, constructing\r\nwater-works, laying out parks, erecting public buildings, and for\r\nmaintaining police systems and fire departments, cause cities to incur\r\ndebts often amounting to many millions of dollars.  As the result of\r\nthe greater expense of its government, and as its people also pay State\r\nand county taxes, the rate of taxation in a city is far greater than in\r\nrural districts and villages.\r\n\r\nCITIZENS: RIGHTS AND DUTIES.--The qualifications, the rights, and the\r\nduties of citizens of the city are the same as those of citizens of the\r\ntownship and the county.  The qualifications of voters are also usually\r\nthe same.  The duties of voters are the same in all elections, whether\r\nin the school district, the civil district, the city, the county, the\r\nState, or the United States; namely, to vote for the best men and the\r\nbest measures.  Under whatever division of government the people are\r\nliving, they always have the same interest in the maintenance of order,\r\nin the enforcement of the laws, in the triumph of right, principles,\r\nand in the election of good men to office.\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT.--A city often has a more complex government than that of\r\nthe State in which the city is situated.  The massing of so many\r\npeople, representing so many interests, requires a government with\r\nstrong legislative, executive, and judicial functions.  One of the\r\ngreat questions of our time is how to secure economy and efficiency in\r\ncity government; and, as our cities are growing with great rapidity,\r\nthe problem is daily becoming more difficult to solve.\r\n\r\nOFFICERS.--The legislative power is vested in the city council, in many\r\ncases composed of a board of aldermen and of a common council.  The\r\nexecutive authority is vested in the mayor, the city attorney or\r\nsolicitor, the city clerk, the assessor, the collector, the treasurer,\r\nthe city engineer or surveyor, the board of public works, the street\r\ncommissioner, the school board or board of education, and the\r\nsuperintendent of schools.  The judicial power is vested in the city\r\ncourt, police court, or recorder's court, as it is variously termed; in\r\na number of justices' courts; and in the higher courts, which are also\r\ncourts of the county in which the city is located.  The officers of the\r\ncity are usually elected by the legal voters, but in some cities the\r\ncollector, the city engineer, the street commissioner, and a number of\r\nsubordinate officers are appointed by the mayor or city council.  The\r\nsuperintendent of schools is elected by the school board.\r\n\r\nDUTIES.--In many small cities, and in several of the larger cities,\r\nsuch as New York, Chicago, and San Francisco, the council consists only\r\nof the board of aldermen.  When the council is composed of two\r\nbranches, a law can not be made by one of them alone; it must be passed\r\nby both; and if vetoed by the mayor, it must be passed again, and in\r\nmost cities by a two thirds vote, or it is void.  The council makes\r\nlaws, or ordinances, regulating the police force; fixing the rate of\r\ncity taxation; ordering the issue of bonds and the construction of\r\npublic works; and making appropriations for public purposes.\r\n\r\nThe mayor is the chief executive of the city.  It is his duty to see\r\nthat the laws are enforced.  He appoints a number of subordinate\r\nofficers, and in most cities may veto the acts of the city council.\r\nThe duties of the city attorney, the city clerk, the assessor, the\r\ncollector, the treasurer, the school board, and the superintendent of\r\nschools are similar to those of township and county officers of the\r\nsame name.  The city engineer has charge of the construction of sewers\r\nand the improvement of parks.  The street commissioner attends to the\r\nconstruction and repair of the streets, crossings, and sidewalks.\r\nThere are a number of officers appointed by the mayor or the council,\r\nsuch as chief of police, chief of the fire department, and the city\r\nphysician, who have duties connected with their special departments.\r\n\r\nThe city judge, police judge, or recorder, has duties similar to those\r\nof the same officer in an incorporated village.  Cities also have\r\nhigher courts, variously named, whose judges have duties and\r\njurisdiction equivalent to those of county officers of the same grade.\r\nBecause offenses against the law are more frequent, officers are more\r\nnumerous in cities than in the rural districts.\r\n\r\nCOMMISSION PLAN OF CITY GOVERNMENT.--In recent times the \"commission\r\nplan\" of government has been adopted for many cities, in a number of\r\ndifferent States.  This plan gives full control of the city government\r\nand its minor officials to a commission or council composed of a few\r\nmen (usually five) elected by the voters of the whole city.  This\r\ncommission exercises both legislative and executive functions.  It is\r\ncomposed of a mayor, and councilmen or commissioners who act also as\r\nheads of administrative departments.\r\n\r\nRECALL.--In a few States a mayor or councilman (or other local or State\r\nofficer elected by the people) may be displaced before the expiration\r\nof his term of office.  If a sufficient number of voters petition to\r\nhave this done, a new election is held to decide whether he or some one\r\nelse shall have the office for the rest of the term.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n1. What is meant by incorporating a village?\r\n\r\n2. What is a breach of the peace?\r\n\r\n3. What are polling-places?\r\n\r\n4.

What is the largest city of this State?  Is its council composed of\r\none body or of two?\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTION FOR DEBATE.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the legislative department of a city government should\r\nconsist of only one deliberative body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE STATE.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY.--After the county, the government nearest us is that of\r\nthe State.  The political divisions which we have considered are\r\nsubject to the State, holding their powers as grants from its\r\ngovernment.  The State can make and unmake them, and we owe them\r\nobedience because the State has commanded it.  As we sometimes express\r\nit, the sovereignty or supreme sway of these local divisions resides in\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION.--A State is a community of free citizens living within a\r\nterritory with fixed limits, governed by laws based upon a constitution\r\nof their own adoption, and possessing all governmental powers not\r\ngranted to the United States.  Each State is a republic and maintains a\r\nrepublican form of government, which is guaranteed by the United\r\nStates.  The State is supreme within its own sphere, but its authority\r\nmust not conflict with that of the national government.  A State is\r\nsometimes called a commonwealth because it binds the whole people\r\ntogether for their common weal or common good.\r\n\r\nFORMATION OF ORIGINAL STATES.--The thirteen original colonies were\r\nprincipally settled by people from Europe.  The colonial rights were\r\nset forth and boundaries fixed by charters granted by the crown of\r\nEngland.  In the Declaration of Independence these colonies declared\r\nthemselves \"free and independent States.\"  After the treaty of peace\r\nwhich acknowledged their independence, they framed and adopted the\r\nnational constitution, and thereby became the United States of America.\r\n\r\nADMISSION OF NEW STATES.--New States are admitted into the Union by\r\nspecial acts of the Congress of the United States.  An organized\r\nTerritory having the necessary population sends a memorial to Congress\r\nasking to be admitted as a State.  Congress then passes a law called an\r\n\"enabling act,\" authorizing the people of the Territory to form a State\r\nconstitution.  When the people have framed and adopted a State\r\nconstitution not in conflict with the Constitution of the United\r\nStates, Congress passes another act admitting the new State into the\r\nUnion \"upon an equal footing with the original States in all respects\r\nwhatever.\"  Sometimes the enabling act provides for admission on\r\nproclamation of the President of the United States.  Several of the\r\nTerritories adopted State constitutions and were admitted as States\r\nwithout enabling acts.\r\n\r\nPURPOSES.--The State keeps power near the people, and thus makes them\r\nmore secure in their liberty.  \"The powers not granted to the United\r\nStates, nor prohibited to the States, are reserved to the States\r\nrespectively or to the people.\"  If the whole country were a single\r\nrepublic without State divisions, power would be withdrawn from the\r\npeople and become centralized in the national government.\r\n\r\nOur political system leaves the various functions of government to the\r\nsmallest political communities that can perform them efficiently.  The\r\ncounty has charge of all public interests that can be managed by it as\r\nwell as by the State.  Many public affairs, such as popular\r\neducation,[1] private corporations, and the organization of the smaller\r\npolitical divisions, can be better managed by the State than by the\r\nNational Government, and are therefore properly left to the State's\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nParts of the country widely separated differ in climate and soil,\r\ngiving rise to different industries and occupations, which require\r\ndifferent laws, made and administered by different States.  The State\r\nserves as a convenient basis for the apportionment of members of both\r\nhouses of Congress, and State institutions preserve and develop the\r\nlocal individuality and self-reliance of the people.\r\n\r\nFUNCTIONS.--The functions of the State are very extensive, including\r\nthe greater part of those acts of government which preserve society by\r\naffording security to life, liberty, property, and the pursuit of\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nThe State government touches the citizens at most points; that is, all\r\nthose laws that concern the body of the people in their ordinary daily\r\nlife are made and enforced by the State, or by the smaller political\r\ndivisions of the State, acting under the State's directions.  Officers\r\ndischarge their duties, arrests are made, courts are held, offenders\r\nare punished, justice is meted out, and taxes are collected, by the\r\nauthority of the State.\r\n\r\nThe National Government has similar functions to perform in every part\r\nof the country, but they are far less frequent than those of the State.\r\n\r\nINSTITUTIONS.--The State maintains a number of charitable and other\r\ninstitutions for the public welfare.  It makes appropriations of land\r\nor money for the support of asylums, prisons, reformatories, scientific\r\ninstitutions, schools, colleges, and universities.  The support of\r\nthese institutions, the payment of salaries, the administration of\r\njustice, and the conduct of other public interests, involve large\r\nannual expenditures, often amounting to several millions of dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCITIZENS.\r\n\r\nThe citizens of a State are the people who live in it, whether natives\r\nof the United States, or foreigners who have been adopted.  Persons who\r\nare citizens of the United States are thereby citizens of the State in\r\nwhich they reside.  They have all the rights that freemen can possess,\r\nand enjoy a larger freedom than do the people of any other country.\r\n\r\nThe legal voters, often called electors, are the male citizens who have\r\nresided in the State, the county, and the township, or voting precinct,\r\nthe time required by law to entitle them to vote.  The length of\r\nresidence required in the State varies, being two years in some, six\r\nmonths in others, and one year in most States.  Several States permit\r\ncitizens of foreign countries to vote, and a few permit women to vote.\r\n\r\nRIGHTS.--Every citizen has the right to be secure in his person; to be\r\nfree from attack and annoyance; to go when and where he may choose; to\r\nkeep, enjoy, and dispose of his property; and to provide in his own way\r\nfor the welfare of himself and of those dependent upon him.\r\n\r\nThe rights of the people are set forth at length and with great\r\nprecision in a portion of the State constitution called the Bill of\r\nRights.  These rights must be exercised under the restrictions of the\r\nlaw, and with due regard for the same rights held by others.\r\n\r\nThe legal voters have the right to vote in all local, State, and\r\nnational elections.  They are voters in national elections by virtue of\r\nbeing voters in State elections.  The right to vote implies the right\r\nto be voted for, and the right to hold office; but for many officers\r\nthe State requires a longer residence and other qualifications than\r\nthose prescribed for voters.\r\n\r\nDUTIES.--For every right, the people have a corresponding duty; and for\r\nevery privilege they enjoy, there is a trust for them to discharge.\r\nThe large personal freedom possessed by the American citizens imposes\r\nequally as large public responsibilities.  It is the duty of every\r\ncitizen to obey the law, to aid in securing justice, to respect\r\nauthority, to love his country, and to labor for the public good.  No\r\none can be a useful member of society unless he respects the laws and\r\ninstitutions of the land.  The people themselves have established this\r\ngovernment, both State and national; it exists for them, and therefore\r\nthey owe it honor and obedience.\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of every voter to study the interests of the country,\r\nand to vote for persons and measures that, in his opinion, will best\r\n\"promote the general welfare.\"  In this country, government is\r\nintrusted to the whole people, and they can govern only by expressing\r\ntheir will in elections.  Therefore the majority must rule.  The\r\nmajority will sometimes make mistakes, but these will be corrected\r\nafter a time.  In order that good government may ensue, good citizens\r\nmust take part in elections.  The privilege of suffrage is conferred\r\nupon an implied contract that it will be used for the public good.  He\r\nwho fails to vote when he can, fails to perform his part of the\r\ncontract, fails to fulfill his promise, and fails to respect the\r\ngovernment that protects him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSTITUTION.\r\n\r\nThe constitution is often called the supreme law of the State.  In\r\nother words, it is the supreme act of the people, for the purpose of\r\norganizing themselves as a body politic, of formulating their\r\ngovernment, and of fixing the limits of its power.  It is a contract\r\nbetween the whole society as a political body, and each of its members.\r\nEach binds himself to the whole body, and the whole body binds itself\r\nto each, in order that all may be governed by the same laws for the\r\ncommon good.  The constitution of each State is a written instrument,\r\nmodeled after the Constitution of the United States, with which it must\r\nnot conflict.\r\n\r\nThe constitutions of England and most other countries of Europe are\r\nunwritten.  They consist of the common usages and maxims that have\r\nbecome fixed by long experience.  In those countries, when a new\r\npolitical custom grows into common practice it thereby becomes a part\r\nof the national constitution.\r\n\r\nFORMATION AND ADOPTION.--As the whole people can not assemble in one\r\nplace to frame and adopt a constitution, they elect delegates to a\r\nconstitutional convention.  The convention usually meets at the\r\ncapital, deliberates, frames articles for a proposed constitution, and\r\nin nearly all cases submits them to the people.  The people make known\r\ntheir will in a general election, and if a majority vote in favor of\r\nadopting the proposed constitution, it becomes the constitution of the\r\nState.  If the proposed constitution is rejected, another convention\r\nmust be called to propose other articles to be voted upon by the people.\r\n\r\nPURPOSES.--The purposes of the constitution are to guard the rights of\r\nthe people, to protect the liberties of the minority, to grant\r\nauthority to the government, to separate the functions of the three\r\ndepartments, to prescribe the limits of each, and to fix in the public\r\npolicy those maxims of political wisdom that have been sanctioned by\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe special tendency in recent amendments of State constitutions has\r\nbeen to limit the power of the legislature.  Constitutions, like other\r\npolitical institutions, are largely matters of growth, and from time to\r\ntime must be revised to meet the changing wants of society.  For this\r\npurpose the constitution of almost every State contains a provision,\r\ncalled the open clause, which authorizes the legislature, under certain\r\nrestrictions, to propose amendments to the constitution to be adopted\r\nor rejected by a vote of the people.\r\n\r\nVALUE.--The people of any State may, at their pleasure, frame and adopt\r\na new constitution, which must be in harmony with the Constitution of\r\nthe United States.  The right to make their own constitution is one of\r\nthe highest and most important rights that freemen can possess.  It is\r\nin this and in the right of suffrage that their freedom principally\r\nconsists.\r\n\r\nThe constitution protects the people by prescribing the limits of\r\nofficial authority.  The legislature can not legally pass a law which\r\nthe constitution of the State forbids, and when such a law is passed it\r\nis declared unconstitutional by the State courts.  A provision of a\r\nState constitution becomes void when declared by the supreme court of\r\nthe United States to be in conflict with the national Constitution.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.--The constitutions of the several States are based upon the\r\nConstitution of the United States as a model, and are therefore much\r\nalike in their general provisions.  Each contains:\r\n\r\nA preamble setting forth the purposes of the constitution;\r\n\r\nA lengthy declaration called the bill of rights;\r\n\r\nProvisions for distributing the powers of government into three\r\ndepartments; and\r\n\r\nArticles relating to suffrage, debt, taxation, corporations, public\r\nschools, militia, amendments, and other public affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBILL OF RIGHTS.\r\n\r\nThe bill of rights usually declares various rights of the citizen which\r\nmay be classified under the heads of republican principles, personal\r\nsecurity, private property, freedom of conscience, freedom of speech\r\nand of the press, freedom of assembly, and freedom from military\r\ntyranny.\r\n\r\n\r\nREPUBLICAN PRINCIPLES.--Under this head the bill declares:\r\n\r\nThat all power is inherent in the people;\r\n\r\nThat governments exist for their good, and by their consent;\r\n\r\nThat all freemen are equal;\r\n\r\nThat no title of nobility shall be conferred;\r\n\r\nThat exclusive privileges shall not be granted except in consideration\r\nof public services;\r\n\r\nThat all elections shall be free and equal.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERSONAL SECURITY.--In the interests of the personal security of the\r\ncitizen it is provided:\r\n\r\nThat the people shall be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and\r\npossessions, from unreasonable seizures and searches;\r\n\r\nThat warrants to seize and to search persons and things must describe\r\nthem by oath or affirmation;\r\n\r\nThat there shall be no imprisonment for debt, except in cases of fraud.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRIVATE PROPERTY.--To secure the rights of private property, the bill\r\ndeclares:\r\n\r\nThat private property shall not be taken for public use without just\r\ncompensation;\r\n\r\nAnd, in some States, that long leases of agricultural lands shall not\r\nbe made.\r\n\r\n\r\nFREEDOM OF CONSCIENCE.--To induce the entire freedom of conscience of\r\nthe citizen it is declared:\r\n\r\nThat there shall be perfect religious freedom, but not covering immoral\r\npractices;\r\n\r\nThat there shall be no State church;\r\n\r\nThat no religious test shall be required for performing any public\r\nfunction;\r\n\r\nThat the rights of conscience are free from human control.\r\n\r\n\r\nFREEDOM OF SPEECH AND OF THE PRESS.--To maintain the rightful freedom\r\nof the press, the bill guarantees:\r\n\r\nThat printing-presses may be used by all;\r\n\r\nThat every citizen may freely speak, write, and print upon any\r\nsubject--being responsible for the abuse of the right.\r\n\r\n\r\nFREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY.--The right of assembly is secured by the provision:\r\n\r\nThat the people may peaceably assemble for the public good, to discuss\r\nquestions of public interest; and\r\n\r\nThat they may petition the government for redress of grievances.\r\n\r\n\r\nFREEDOM FROM MILITARY TYRANNY.--To guard against abuses by the\r\nmilitary, it is declared:\r\n\r\nThat the military shall be in strict subordination to the civil power;\r\n\r\nThat no standing army shall be maintained in time of peace;\r\n\r\nThat in time of peace no soldier shall be quartered in any house\r\nwithout the owner's consent;\r\n\r\nThat the right of people to bear arms shall not be questioned.  This\r\ndoes not authorize the carrying of concealed weapons.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORBIDDEN LAWS.--To insure the people against improper legislation, the\r\nbill of rights provides:\r\n\r\nThat no _ex post facto_ law or law impairing the validity of contracts,\r\nshall be made;\r\n\r\nThat no bill of attainder shall be passed;\r\n\r\nThat no power of suspending laws shall be exercised except by the\r\nlegislature.\r\n\r\n\r\nRIGHTS OF THE ACCUSED.--Among the worst abuses of tyranny in all ages\r\nhave been the corruption of the courts and the denial of the rights of\r\ncommon justice.  To guard against these it is expressly provided:\r\n\r\nThat the writ of _habeas corpus_ shall not be suspended except when, in\r\ncases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require it;\r\n\r\nThat, except in capital cases, persons charged with crime may give bail;\r\n\r\nThat no excessive bail shall be required;\r\n\r\nThat all courts shall be open;\r\n\r\nThat the accused shall have a speedy trial in the district in which the\r\noffense was committed;\r\n\r\nThat the ancient mode of trial by jury shall be maintained; but civil\r\nsuits, by consent of the parties, may be tried without a jury;\r\n\r\nThat all persons injured in lands, goods, person, or reputation shall\r\nhave remedy by course of law;\r\n\r\nThat the accused shall be informed of the nature of the charges against\r\nhim;\r\n\r\nThat he shall be confronted by the witnesses against him;\r\n\r\nThat he shall be heard in his own defense, and may have the benefit of\r\ncounsel;\r\n\r\nThat he shall not be required to testify against himself;\r\n\r\nThat he shall not be deprived of life, liberty, or property except by\r\ndue process of law;\r\n\r\nThat no cruel or unusual punishment shall be inflicted;\r\n\r\nThat no one shall be twice placed in jeopardy for the same offense.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo citizen of the United States would deny the justice of these\r\ndeclarations.  They are so reasonable it seems strange that they should\r\never have been questioned.  \"But in enumerating them we are treading on\r\nsacred ground.  Their establishment cost our ancestors hundreds of\r\nyears of struggle against arbitrary power, in which they gave their\r\nblood and treasure.\"[2]\r\n\r\nIt was to secure and maintain a part of these rights that the American\r\ncolonies went to war with Great Britain, and made good their\r\nDeclaration of Independence by an appeal to arms.\r\n\r\nMost of these rights are preserved in the Constitution of the United\r\nStates, to prevent encroachments upon the liberties of the people by\r\nthe General Government.  They are repeated in the State constitution in\r\norder that they may not be invaded by the State Government.  There is\r\nalso a provision in the constitution of the State which declares that\r\n\"the enumeration of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or\r\ndisparage others retained by the people.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Popular education must command the sympathy and respect of the\r\npeople in each locality in order to remain \"popular.\"  While the State,\r\ntherefore, enforces a general system of public schools, it leaves all\r\nthe details of local management with the people most closely related to\r\nthe particular school.  The people esteem that which they create and\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\n[2]McCleary's _Studies in Civics_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n1.

It has a legislative department charged with the making\r\nof the laws, an executive department to enforce the laws, and a\r\njudicial department to explain and apply the laws.  Each of the\r\ndepartments is independent of the others, being supreme within its own\r\nsphere.\r\n\r\nThe American people believe that the functions of making, of enforcing,\r\nand of explaining the laws, should forever be separate and distinct.\r\nExperience has shown that it is dangerous to the liberties of the\r\npeople to permit either of the three departments of government to\r\ntrespass upon the functions of the others.  Therefore, the limits of\r\neach department are well defined, and its power closely guarded, by the\r\nconstitution and laws of the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\nThe legislative or law-making power of the State is vested in the\r\nlegislature, sometimes called the general assembly, and in some States\r\nknown as the general court, or legislative assembly.  The legislature\r\nis composed of two bodies, or houses, called respectively the Senate\r\nand the House of Representatives.  In New York the latter body is known\r\nas the Assembly, in New Jersey it is called the General Assembly and in\r\nsome States the House of Delegates.  A bill must be passed by both\r\nbranches of the legislature in order to become a law.  The proceedings\r\nof the legislature should be made public, and therefore the sessions\r\nare open, and the constitution requires each house to keep and publish\r\na daily record, called the _Journal_.\r\n\r\nQUALIFICATIONS.--The State constitution prescribes the age, the length\r\nof residence, and other legal qualifications for membership in each\r\nbranch of the legislature.  The constitutions of most States fix a\r\nlonger term of office and require a more mature age for senators than\r\nfor representatives.  In addition to these legal qualifications a\r\nlegislator should be a man of unswerving honesty, of broad information,\r\nof close thought, well versed in the principles of government,\r\nacquainted with the needs of the country, and faithful to the interests\r\nof the whole people.\r\n\r\nPRIVILEGES.--Each branch of the legislature consists of members elected\r\nby the people.  Senators and representatives are responsible for their\r\nofficial acts to the people, and to the people alone.  Except for\r\ntreason, felony, and breach of the peace, members of the legislature\r\nare privileged from arrest while attending the sessions of their\r\nrespective houses, and while going thereto and returning therefrom.\r\nFor any speech or debate in either house, a member thereof can not be\r\nquestioned in any other place.\r\n\r\nEach house adopts rules for its own government.  Each house also elects\r\nits own officers, except that in most States the people elect a\r\nlieutenant-governor, who is also president of the Senate.  These\r\nvarious privileges are granted in the State constitution in order that\r\nthe actions of the legislature may be free from all outside influences.\r\n\r\nPOWER.--The constitution of the State defines the limits of the power\r\nvested in the legislative department.  The legislature may enact any\r\nlaw not forbidden by the Constitution of the State or of the United\r\nStates.  Every act passed is binding upon the people unless it is\r\ndeclared by the courts to be unconstitutional.  An act of the\r\nlegislature, when declared to be unconstitutional, thereby becomes\r\nvoid; that is, it ceases to have any legal force.\r\n\r\nSESSIONS.--The legislature meets at the State Capitol.  In a few States\r\nthe legislature holds annual sessions, but in far the greater number it\r\nmeets biennially; that is, once every two years.  In many States the\r\nconstitution limits the session to a certain number of days, but in a\r\nfew of these States the legislature may extend its session by a special\r\nvote of two-thirds of each house.  A majority constitutes a quorum for\r\nbusiness, but a smaller number may meet and adjourn from day to day in\r\norder that the organization may not be lost.\r\n\r\nFUNCTIONS.--The legislature enacts laws upon a great variety of\r\nsubjects.  It fixes the rate of State taxation, it provides for the\r\ncollection and distribution of State revenue, creates offices and fixes\r\nsalaries, provides for a system of popular education, and makes laws\r\nrelating to public works, the administration of justice, the conduct of\r\nelections, the management of railways and other corporations, the\r\nmaintenance of charitable and other institutions, the construction and\r\nrepair of public roads, the organization of the militia, the conduct of\r\nprisons and reformatories, and a number of other public interests.\r\n\r\nFORBIDDEN POWERS.--The Constitution  of the United States forbids any\r\nState to exercise certain powers:\r\n\r\n(1) No State can enter into any treaty, alliance, confederation,\r\ncontract, or agreement with any other State, or with a foreign power;\r\nissue commissions to vessels authorizing them to capture and destroy\r\nthe merchant ships of other nations; coin money; issue paper money;\r\nmake any thing but gold and silver coin a legal tender for the payment\r\nof debts; pass any bill inflicting the penalty of death without a\r\nregular trial, or any law fixing a penalty for acts done before its\r\nadoption, or any law affecting the provisions of contracts made before\r\nits passage; or grant any title of nobility.\r\n\r\n(2) No State can, without the consent of Congress, lay a tax or duty on\r\nimports or exports, except what is necessary in executing its\r\ninspection laws.  The net proceeds of all duties laid by any State for\r\nthis purpose must be paid into the treasury of the United States; and\r\nall such laws are subject to the revision and control of Congress.\r\nWithout the consent of Congress, no State can tax ships, keep troops or\r\nships of war in time of peace, or engage in war unless invaded or in\r\nimminent danger.\r\n\r\n(3) \"No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the\r\nprivileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall\r\nany State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due\r\nprocess of law, nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the\r\nequal protection of the laws.\"\r\n\r\n(4) \"[No] State shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in\r\naid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or any\r\nclaim for loss or emancipation of any slave.\"\r\n\r\nTHE SENATE.--The Senate is a less numerous body than the House of\r\nRepresentatives.  The presiding officer is addressed as \"Mr. President\"\r\nor \"Mr. Speaker,\" the title varying in different States.  There is also\r\na chief clerk, with assistants, who keeps the records; a\r\nsergeant-at-arms, who preserves order on the floor; a doorkeeper, who\r\nhas charge of the senate chamber and its entrances, and a number of\r\nsubordinate officers.\r\n\r\nThe Senate has two functions not belonging to the House of\r\nRepresentatives: 1. When the governor nominates persons for appointment\r\nas officers of the State, unless the Senate advises and consents to the\r\nnominations, the appointments are void; 2. When the House of\r\nRepresentatives presents articles of impeachment against an officer of\r\nthe State, the Senate sits as a court to try the charges.\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.--The House of Representatives is often called\r\nthe popular branch of the legislature.  It is sometimes designated as\r\nthe \"House.\"  The title of the presiding officer is \"Mr. Speaker.\"  The\r\nother officers usually have the same titles and duties as those of the\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\nIn many States bills raising revenue, and in some States bills making\r\nappropriations, must originate in the House of Representatives.  This\r\nbody also has the sole power of impeachment.  Usually when charges\r\naffecting the official conduct of an officer of the State are brought\r\nbefore the legislature, the House of Representatives appoints a\r\ncommittee to investigate the charges and report.  If the report\r\nwarrants further action, the House adopts charges of official\r\nmisconduct, or of high crimes and misdemeanors in office.  This\r\nproceeding is called an _impeachment_.\r\n\r\nThe Senate sits as a court of impeachment, hears the evidence, listens\r\nto the argument by the managers and the counsel for the accused, and\r\nthen condemns or acquits.  The judgment in cases of impeachment is\r\nremoval from office and disqualification to hold any office of honor,\r\ntrust, or profit under the State.\r\n\r\nDIRECT LEGISLATION.--In order to give fuller and quicker effect to the\r\nwill of the people in law making, recent provisions in the\r\nconstitutions of some States provide for the initiative and referendum.\r\nBy the initiative a certain number of voters may petition for the\r\nenactment of a law set forth in the petition.  If the legislature does\r\nnot pass the act petitioned for, it may be enacted by the people,\r\nvoting on it in a general or special election--the referendum.  On\r\npetition of a certain number of voters also, a referendum may be\r\nordered as to a bill passed by the legislature, to which the\r\npetitioners object, giving the people the opportunity to ratify or\r\nreject the proposed law.\r\n\r\nThese methods of direct legislation have been applied also to the\r\nmaking of constitutional amendments, and to some city, as well as some\r\nstate governments.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n1.

The people's\r\nrepresentatives in the legislative department make the laws.  The\r\npeople's servants in the executive department execute the laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\nThe chief executive officers of the State are the governor, the\r\nlieutenant-governor, the secretary of state, the auditor or\r\ncomptroller, the treasurer, the attorney-general, and the\r\nsuperintendent of public instruction, who, in most States, are elected\r\nby the people.  Besides these, an adjutant-general, a commissioner of\r\nagriculture, a commissioner of insurance, railway commissioners, a\r\nregister of the land office or land commissioner, and in some States\r\nother subordinate officers, are usually appointed by the governor, and\r\nconfirmed by the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe higher State offices are provided for in the constitution, while\r\nthe subordinate offices are created by act of the legislature.  Several\r\nStates have no lieutenant-governor; in some the secretary of state and\r\nthe superintendent of public instruction are appointed by the governor,\r\nand in others some of the subordinate officers are elected by the\r\npeople.  The titles of many of these officers vary in different States.\r\n\r\nThe terms of the State officers elected by the people are usually alike\r\nin the same State, but in some States there are differences.  In\r\nseveral States the terms of the auditor and the treasurer are less than\r\nthose of the other officers.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR: TERM, QUALIFICATIONS.--The supreme executive authority is\r\nvested in the governor, who is therefore sometimes called the chief\r\nexecutive of the State.  His position is one of great dignity and\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nThe term of office is one, two, three, or four years, varying in\r\ndifferent States, and in some the constitution prohibits any person\r\nfrom serving two terms in succession.\r\n\r\nThe legal qualifications of the office of governor vary in different\r\nStates.  He must be a citizen of the United States; must have resided\r\nin the State at least a fixed term of years; must not be under a\r\ncertain age, usually thirty years; and in some States must own property\r\nof a given value.\r\n\r\nPOWERS, DUTIES.--The governor is commander-in-chief of the military\r\nforces of the State, and represents it in its dealings with other\r\nStates.  He may call on all other executive officers for written\r\ninformation concerning their respective duties.  He is presumed to be\r\nwell informed upon the affairs of the people, and is therefore required\r\nto give the legislature information as to the condition of the State,\r\nand to recommend the passage of such laws as he deems proper and\r\nexpedient.\r\n\r\nThe governor may call special meetings of the legislature to consider\r\nquestions of great and immediate public concern.  At the opening of\r\neach session he addresses a regular message to the legislature, and\r\nfrom time to time submits special messages upon various subjects.\r\n\r\nAll acts of the legislature are presented for his approval and\r\nsignature.  If he approves and signs them, they become laws; if he\r\nretains them for a certain number of days without signing them, they\r\nbecome laws without his signature; if he refuses to approve them, he\r\nreturns them within the specified time to the house in which they\r\noriginated, with a statement of his objections.\r\n\r\nThis action is called a veto, and the vetoed measure, in order to\r\nbecome a law, must pass both houses again, and in some States must\r\nsecure a two thirds vote of each house.\r\n\r\nThe governor may grant reprieves and pardons, except in cases of\r\nimpeachment, and in some States, of treason.  In some States this power\r\nis limited by a board of pardons, which must recommend a pardon before\r\nit can be granted by the governor; and in others the consent of one\r\nbranch of the legislature must be obtained.\r\n\r\nTreason against the States consists in an open or overt act of \"levying\r\nwar against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and\r\ncomfort.\"\r\n\r\n_To reprieve_ is to delay or postpone for a time the execution of the\r\nsentence of death upon a criminal.\r\n\r\n_To pardon_ is to annul a sentence by forgiving the offense against the\r\nlaw, and by releasing the offender.\r\n\r\nThe governor may also _commute_ the sentence of an offender by\r\nexchanging the penalty for one less severe.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GOVERNOR:--The term and qualifications of the\r\nlieutenant-governor are the same as those of the governor.  The\r\nlieutenant-governor is also president or speaker of the Senate, but\r\nvotes only in case of a tie.  In States having no lieutenant-governor,\r\nthe Senate elects its presiding officer.\r\n\r\nIn case of the death or resignation of the governor, the\r\nlieutenant-governor becomes governor of the State.  In States having no\r\nlieutenant-governor, special laws provide for filling vacancies in the\r\noffice of governor.\r\n\r\nWhen the chief executive is absent from the State, or disabled, the\r\nlieutenant-governor performs the duties of the office.\r\n\r\nSECRETARY OF STATE.--The secretary of state is the keeper of all State\r\npapers, and usually of the great seal of the State.  In some States he\r\nis _ex officio_ auditor.  He keeps a record of the proceedings and acts\r\nof the legislature and of the executive department of the State\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nHe certifies to the correctness of State documents and commissions,\r\nindexes the laws, and attends to their printing and distribution,\r\nexcept in States having a superintendent of printing.  He receives and\r\npreserves the returns of elections, and in some States has charge of\r\nthe State buildings at the capital.\r\n\r\nAUDITOR, OR COMPTROLLER.--The auditor is the financial agent of the\r\nState, and in some States acts as register of the land office, and in\r\nothers as commissioner of insurance.  He is also the State's\r\nbookkeeper, and attends to the collection of its revenue.  He examines\r\nand adjusts claims and accounts against the State, and orders the\r\npayment of such as he approves.  He receives moneys paid to the State,\r\ndeposits them with the treasurer, and takes receipt therefor.  No funds\r\ncan be paid out of the State treasury except upon the auditor's\r\nwarrant.  He makes an annual or biennial report, showing the financial\r\ncondition of the State.  In some States having no auditor, these\r\nvarious duties fall to other officers, chiefly to the secretary of\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nTREASURER.--The treasurer is custodian of the funds of the State.  He\r\nreceives the State's revenues from the auditor, and pays them out only\r\nupon the auditor's warrant, keeping an accurate account of all sums\r\npaid.  The treasurer and the auditor (and also the secretary of state\r\nwhen he handles State funds) give heavy bonds for the faithful\r\nperformance of their duties.\r\n\r\nATTORNEY-GENERAL.--The attorney-general is a lawyer who acts as\r\nattorney for the State in law cases to which the State is a party.  His\r\nduties pertain chiefly to the higher courts of the State.  He is the\r\nlegal adviser of the State officers, and, when requested by them, gives\r\nopinions upon points of law.\r\n\r\nHe prosecutes persons who are indebted to the State, and assists in\r\nbringing to justice those charged with crime.  He represents the State\r\nin its legal business in the supreme court at Washington, and in the\r\nother courts of the United States.\r\n\r\nSUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION.--The superintendent of public\r\ninstruction has charge of the public school system, and thus\r\nsuperintends one of the largest interests of the State.  He has the\r\ngeneral management of State teachers' institutes, and in some States he\r\nhas an official connection with the State university and the State\r\nnormal schools, either as a member of the faculty or as president or\r\nsecretary of the board of trustees.\r\n\r\nHe is an officer of, and usually president of, the State board of\r\neducation, a body generally consisting of from three to seven members,\r\nand in most States composed, in part, of other high officers of the\r\nState.  The State board of education decides questions of school law,\r\nand performs other important duties varying in different States.\r\n\r\nThe superintendent of public instruction makes an annual or biennial\r\nreport to the legislature, showing the condition of the public schools\r\nand suggesting amendments to the system.  In many States the\r\nsuperintendent is elected by the people; in some he is appointed by the\r\ngovernor; in others he is elected by the State board of education, and,\r\nas president or secretary of that board, is _ex efficio_ superintendent\r\nof public instruction.\r\n\r\nOTHER OFFICERS.--The _adjutant-general_ is the active officer of the\r\nState militia.\r\n\r\nThe _commissioner of agriculture_, sometimes called the secretary of\r\nthe board of agriculture, looks after the agricultural interests of the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nThe _commissioner of insurance_ oversees the insurance companies doing\r\nbusiness in the State.\r\n\r\nThe _railway commissioners_ assess the value of railway property, and\r\nto a limited extent regulate charges on railway lines.\r\n\r\nThe _register of the land office, or land commissioner_, keeps in his\r\noffice the patents or title-deeds of land issued by the State in its\r\nearly settlement, and furnishes copies of land patents and warrants to\r\nthose who desire them.  In a few States this officer is elected by the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe _State librarian_ has charge of the State library, and in some\r\nStates is superintendent of the State buildings at the capital.\r\n\r\nIn a few States there are other executive officers, among whom may be\r\nnamed:\r\n\r\nA _surveyor-general_, who surveys the public lands, and keeps in his\r\noffice maps of counties and townships;\r\n\r\nA _State engineer_, who superintends the construction and repair of\r\ncanals and levees;\r\n\r\nA _commissioner of statistics_, who collects statistics relating to\r\npublic interests;\r\n\r\nA _commissioner of immigration_, who attends to the interests of\r\nimmigrants;\r\n\r\nA _labor commissioner_, who looks after the interests of the laboring\r\nclasses;\r\n\r\nA _bank inspector_, or _superintendent of banking_, who inspects State\r\nbanks for the protection of the public; and\r\n\r\nA _State examiner_, who investigates the conduct of State institutions,\r\nand inspects the State offices, in order to secure honesty and\r\nefficiency in public affairs.\r\n\r\nIn some States two or more of these offices are combined, and in others\r\ntheir duties are performed by the higher officers of the State.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n1. What is the term of office and what the name of the governor of this\r\nState?\r\n\r\n2. What are the age and the length of residence required of him?\r\n\r\n3. How many terms can he serve in succession?\r\n\r\n4. Has this State a lieutenant-governor?\r\n\r\n5. If so, name his qualifications.\r\n\r\n6. What is the great seal of the State?\r\n\r\n7. What is the necessity of an auditor?\r\n\r\n8. Why should the superintendent of public instruction make a report?\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTION FOR DEBATE\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the governor should hold the power of veto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE STATE--(Continued).\r\n\r\nJUDICIAL DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\nPURPOSES.--The judicial department of the State government exists for\r\nthe sole purpose of administering justice; that is, for the purpose of\r\ninterpreting the laws and of applying them to particular cases.  The\r\nlegislature makes the laws, but it can not execute them.  The governor\r\nrecommends the passage of certain laws, and holds the veto power; but\r\nhe has no law-making power, nor can he try the most trivial suit.\r\n\r\nSo the judiciary has no voice in making or in executing the laws, its\r\nsole function being to decide their meaning and to apply them in\r\nsecuring justice.  The legislative and executive departments may\r\nassist, but it is the peculiar province of the judiciary to protect\r\nsociety and to maintain the rights of the people.\r\n\r\nSUPREME COURT.--The higher courts of the State are of two\r\nclasses--those whose jurisdiction includes the entire State, and those\r\nwhose jurisdiction is confined to particular districts.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court, called in some States the Court of Appeals, is the\r\nhighest court of the State.  The number of the judges of the supreme\r\ncourt varies in the different States, there being a chief justice and\r\nfrom two to eight associate justices in each State.\r\n\r\nIn some States the Justices are elected by the people; in others they\r\nare elected by the legislature; and in some they are appointed by the\r\ngovernor, and confirmed by the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe term of office is lengthy, not less than four years in any State,\r\nexcept Vermont, where it is two years; six, seven, eight, nine, ten,\r\ntwelve, fourteen, or fifteen years in most States; twenty-one years in\r\nPennsylvania; during good behavior in Massachusetts; until the judges\r\nare seventy years of age in New Hampshire; and practically for life in\r\nRhode Island.\r\n\r\nThe jurisdiction of the supreme court, or court of appeals, extends\r\nover the entire State.  It holds sessions at the State capital, and in\r\nsome States at other prominent places, and is chiefly engaged in the\r\ntrial of cases in which appeals have been taken from the decisions of\r\nthe lower courts.\r\n\r\nIts decision is final, but in cases in which it is alleged that the\r\nState law is in conflict with the constitution or laws of the United\r\nStates, appeals may be taken to the United States Supreme Court at\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nDISTRICT, OR CIRCUIT COURT.--The people most commonly resort to the\r\ndistrict court, circuit court, or superior court, as it is variously\r\ncalled in different States, to secure justice.  In it are tried the\r\ngreat body of important civil and criminal cases, and also appeals from\r\nthe lower courts.\r\n\r\nThe jurisdiction of the district court is limited to a district created\r\nby the State constitution or by act of the State legislature.  In some\r\ncases the district consists of a single county; usually it includes two\r\nor more counties, the court being held successively in each county of\r\nthe district.\r\n\r\nIn each district there is usually one district judge, who is elected by\r\nthe people, appointed by the governor, or elected by the legislature.\r\n\r\nThe term of office in most States is four, six, or eight years.\r\n\r\nIn some of the districts of certain States there are criminal courts\r\nhaving jurisdiction in criminal cases, and chancery courts or courts of\r\ncommon pleas having jurisdiction in certain civil cases.\r\n\r\nIn some States there is a high court of chancery having State\r\njurisdiction, and in others there is a superior court which has State\r\njurisdiction, and whose rank is between the supreme court and the\r\ndistrict courts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTERRITORIES.\r\n\r\nORGANIZATION.--Congress organizes the public domain into Territories,\r\nfixes their boundaries, and establishes their governments.  The act of\r\norganization is passed as soon as the population is dense enough to\r\nrequire governmental authority.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT.--The governor and the secretary of the Territory\r\nare appointed by the President of the United States, with the consent\r\nof the United States Senate, and serve for four years, unless removed.\r\nThe governor appoints a treasurer, an auditor or comptroller, a\r\nsuperintendent of public instruction, an attorney-general, and several\r\nother territorial officers.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE DEPARTMENT.--The legislature consists of a senate of eight\r\nor fifteen members, and a house of representatives of sixteen or thirty\r\nmembers elected by the people of the Territory.  The senate is\r\nsometimes called the upper house of the legislature.  Although the\r\ngovernor and the legislature rule the Territory, all laws passed by\r\nthem must be submitted to Congress, and, if disapproved, they become\r\nnull and void.\r\n\r\nJUDICIAL DEPARTMENT.--The judiciary consists of a supreme court and\r\ninferior courts.  The chief justice and two or more associate justices\r\nof the supreme court are appointed for four years by the President,\r\nwith the consent of the Senate.  The inferior courts are established by\r\nthe territorial legislature.\r\n\r\nREPRESENTATION IN CONGRESS.--Each Territory elects a delegate to the\r\nCongress of the United States.  Territorial delegates serve upon\r\ncommittees, and have the right to debate, but not to vote.  Their real\r\nduties are as agents of their respective Territories.\r\n\r\nLAWS.--Territories are governed by the laws of Congress, by the common\r\nlaw, and by the laws passed by the territorial legislatures.  The\r\ngovernor may pardon offenses against territorial laws, and may grant\r\nreprieves for offenses against the laws of Congress, until the cases\r\ncan be acted upon by the President.\r\n\r\nLOCAL AFFAIRS.--The local interests of a Territory are similar to those\r\nof a State.  Taxation, schools, public works, and the administration of\r\njustice are supported by the people.  The people of the Territories\r\nhave no voice in the election of President, and none in the government\r\nof the United States except through their delegates in Congress.\r\n\r\nPURPOSES.--The chief purposes of the territorial government are to give\r\nthe people the protection of the law, and to prepare the Territory for\r\nadmission into the Union as a State.  A State is a member of the Union,\r\nwith all the rights and privileges of self-government; a Territory is\r\nunder the Union, subject at all times, and in all things, to regulation\r\nby the government of the United States.\r\n\r\nAll the States, except the original thirteen (including Maine, Vermont,\r\nKentucky, and West Virginia) and California and Texas, have had\r\nterritorial governments.  A Territory is not entirely self-governing;\r\nit may be called a State in infancy, requiring the special care of the\r\nUnited States to prepare it for statehood and for admission into the\r\nUnion \"upon an equal footing with the original States in all respects.\"\r\n\r\nHawaii and Alaska illustrate the territorial form of government\r\ndescribed above.  The following are exceptions to the rule:\r\n\r\nThe District of Columbia is neither a State nor a Territory.  It\r\nresembles a Territory in being directly governed by Congress in such\r\nmanner as that body may choose, but it differs from a Territory since\r\nit can never become a State.\r\n\r\nIt is not represented in the government of the United States, and its\r\ninhabitants have no voice in local matters.  Its affairs are\r\nadministered by three commissioners, appointed by the President, with\r\nthe consent of the Senate, and they are subject to the laws of Congress.\r\n\r\nPorto Rico and Philippines have each a legislature and are governed\r\nmuch like a Territory; but their people are not citizens of the United\r\nStates.  They are practically colonies.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n1. Is it better that judges be elected, or that they be appointed?  Why?\r\n\r\n2. Why should a judge's term of office be lengthy?\r\n\r\n3. Who is chief justice of this State?\r\n\r\n4. Who is the judge of the circuit or district court of this district?\r\n\r\n5. At what dates does this court hold sessions in this county?\r\n\r\n6. How many organized Territories now in the United States?  Give their\r\nnames.\r\n\r\n7. When did this State cease to be a Territory?\r\n\r\n8. Why should delegates from the Territories not have the privilege of\r\nvoting in Congress?\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTION FOR DEBATE.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the judges of the higher courts should be appointed by\r\nthe governor, and hold their positions during life and good behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY.--Each division of government which we have considered\r\nexists for only a part of the whole people.  The government of one\r\nState has no authority over the people of other States; but the\r\ngovernment of the United States, often called the national government\r\nor federal government, is for the good of the entire country, and its\r\nauthority is over the whole people.\r\n\r\nAll these divisions of government--the family, the school, the township\r\nor civil district, the county, the State, and the United States--are\r\ndependent upon one another.\r\n\r\nIf family government were destroyed, society would be ruined and other\r\ngovernments would be worthless.\r\n\r\nIf there were no schools, the people would be so ignorant that free\r\ngovernment would be impossible.\r\n\r\nIf the township or civil district were neglected, local government\r\nwould be inefficient.\r\n\r\nIf the States were blotted out, the national government would assume\r\nall power, and the freedom of the people would be greatly abridged, and\r\nperhaps finally lost.\r\n\r\nIf the national government were dismembered, the States would be weak,\r\nhelpless, at war with one another, and at the mercy of foreign nations.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of power among the several political organizations\r\nprevents any of them from assuming too much authority, and thus tends\r\nto preserve the liberties of the people.\r\n\r\nFORMATION.--The national government is based upon the Constitution of\r\nthe United States.  It was formed by the union of the several States\r\nunder the Constitution, and its powers are set forth in that\r\ninstrument.  The thirteen original States ratified the Constitution of\r\nthe United States between December 7, 1787, and May 29, 1790, and thus\r\norganized the national government.  It thus became, and has continued\r\nto be, the government of the whole people, \"by the people and for the\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFORM OF GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\nThe national government, like the government of each State, is a\r\nrepublic; that is, the authority is exercised by the representatives of\r\nthe people.  As all power resides in the people, our government is\r\ncalled a democracy.  As the people elect officers or representatives to\r\nact for them in the performance of public duties, it is called a\r\nrepresentative democracy.\r\n\r\nOur system of government is different from those of all other nations,\r\nbecause part of the political power is vested in the State, and part in\r\nthe nation; that is, in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe national Constitution enumerates the powers which may be exercised\r\nby the national government, and reserves all other powers \"to the\r\nStates respectively, or to the people.\"  Because of this dual or double\r\ncharacter of our system of government, John Quincy Adams called it \"a\r\ncomplicated machine.\"\r\n\r\nPURPOSES.--The purposes of the national government are clearly and\r\nforcibly set forth in the \"preamble,\" or opening clause, of the\r\nConstitution of the United States;\r\n\r\n1. \"To form a more perfect _union_;\"\r\n\r\n2. \"To establish _justice_;\"\r\n\r\n3. \"To insure domestic _tranquillity_;\"\r\n\r\n4. \"To provide for the common _defense_;\"\r\n\r\n5. \"To promote the general _welfare_;\"\r\n\r\n6. \"To secure the blessings of _liberty_ to ourselves and our\r\nposterity.\"\r\n\r\nBefore the Revolutionary war, the American colonies were subject to\r\nGreat Britain.  By the Declaration of Independence these colonies\r\nbecame \"free and independent States.\"  During the period between the\r\nDeclaration of Independence and the adoption of the national\r\nConstitution, the union between the States was weak and unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nInstead of there being \"domestic tranquillity,\" the States were engaged\r\nin constant quarrels.  There was no power to provide for the \"common\r\ndefense\" of the people against foreign enemies; each State must protect\r\nitself as best it could.  No provision could be made for the \"general\r\nwelfare\" by the passage and enforcement of broad measures for the whole\r\ncountry.  Under the Articles of Confederation, as was said at that\r\ntime, the States might \"declare everything, but do nothing.\"  The\r\nadoption of the national Constitution and the formation of the national\r\ngovernment made the inhabitants of the States one people, and have\r\nsince brought the United States to be \"the first of the nations of the\r\nearth.\"\r\n\r\nFUNCTIONS.--The functions of the national government are numerous and\r\nimportant.  In adopting the national Constitution, the States delegated\r\nor ceded to the United States those powers which are necessary to the\r\nstrength and greatness of a nation.\r\n\r\nThe national government administers those public affairs which concern\r\nthe whole people, such as the regulation of commerce, the granting of\r\npatents, and the coinage of money; and also those which pertain to the\r\nUnited States as a nation dealing with other nations, such as declaring\r\nwar and making treaties of peace.\r\n\r\nThe subjects upon which the national Congress may enact laws, and\r\nconsequently the subjects included in the functions of the national\r\ngovernment, are enumerated in Section 8, Article I. of the Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\nCITIZENS.\r\n\r\nThe people who reside in the United States are either citizens or\r\naliens.  The national Constitution declares that \"All persons born or\r\nnaturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction\r\nthereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein\r\nthey reside.\"  Women and children are citizens, though not entitled to\r\nvote.\r\n\r\nA citizen is a member of the body politic, bound to allegiance, and\r\nentitled to protection at home and abroad.  He can renounce his\r\nallegiance--that is, lay down his citizenship--by becoming the subject\r\nof some other country.  Wherever he goes, until he renounces his\r\nallegiance, he is a citizen of the United States, and is shielded from\r\ninsult by the might and majesty of the whole nation.  Citizenship is\r\ntherefore valuable for its protection abroad, as well as for its rights\r\nand privileges at home.\r\n\r\nNATURALIZATION.--Naturalized citizens are persons of foreign birth who\r\nhave become citizens by naturalization, after a continuous residence of\r\nat least five years in the United States.  A foreigner is naturalized\r\nby appearing in court, declaring his intention to become a citizen of\r\nthe United States, and his purpose to renounce all allegiance to\r\nforeign governments.  After two years more, he must appear in open\r\ncourt, renounce upon oath all foreign allegiance, and swear to support\r\nthe Constitution of the United States.  If he bears any title of\r\nnobility, he must renounce it.  Naturalized citizens have all the\r\nrights and privileges that belong to native-born citizens, except that\r\nno naturalized person can become President or Vice President of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nRIGHTS.--The Constitution of the United States does not contain a\r\nformal bill of rights, as do most of the State constitutions, but it\r\nnames the following as among the rights of citizens:\r\n\r\n(1) \"The citizens of each State shall be entitled to all privileges and\r\nimmunities of citizens of the several States\";\r\n\r\nThat is, a citizen who removes into another State shall enjoy all the\r\nrights and privileges that belong to its citizens.\r\n\r\n(2) \"A person charged in any State with treason, felony, or other\r\ncrime, who shall flee from justice, and be found in another State,\r\nshall, on demand of the executive authority of the State from which he\r\nfled, be delivered up, to be removed to the State having jurisdiction\r\nof the crime.\"  A demand for the delivery of a fugitive criminal is\r\ncalled a requisition.\r\n\r\n(3) \"No person held to service or labor in one State under the laws\r\nthereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or\r\nregulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor; but shall\r\nbe delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may\r\nbe due.\"\r\n\r\nThis provision refers to the capture and return of fugitive slaves, and\r\nis rendered void by the abolition of slavery.\r\n\r\n(4) \"A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free\r\nState, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be\r\ninfringed.\"\r\n\r\nThis clause does not authorize the carrying of concealed weapons.\r\n\r\n(5) \"No soldier shall, in time of peace, be quartered in any house\r\nwithout the consent of the owner, nor in time of war but in a manner to\r\nbe prescribed by law.\"\r\n\r\n(6) \"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses,\r\npapers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall\r\nnot be violated; and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause,\r\nsupported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place\r\nto be searched and the persons or things to be seized.\"\r\n\r\n(7) _a_. \"No person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise\r\ninfamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury,\r\nexcept in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the militia\r\nwhen in actual service, in time of war or public danger;\r\n\r\n_b_. \"Nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice\r\nput in jeopardy of life or limb, nor shall be compelled, in any\r\ncriminal case, to be a witness against himself;\r\n\r\n_c_. \"Nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process\r\nof law;\r\n\r\n_d_. \"Nor shall private property be taken for public use without just\r\ncompensation.\"\r\n\r\nThe first part of this clause secures a civil trial to every private\r\ncitizen.  The land and naval forces, and the militia when in actual\r\nservice, are under military law, usually called martial law.\r\n\r\n(8) \"In all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right\r\n\r\n_a_. \"To a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury of the State\r\nand district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which\r\ndistrict shall have been previously ascertained by law;\r\n\r\n_b_. \"To be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation;\r\n\r\n_c_. \"To be confronted with the witnesses against him;\r\n\r\n_d_. \"To have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor;\r\n\r\n_e_. \"And to have the assistance of counsel for his defense.\"\r\n\r\n(9) \"In suits at law where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty\r\ndollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact\r\ntried by a jury shall be otherwise re-examined in any court of the\r\nUnited States than according to the rules of the common law.\"\r\n\r\n(10) \"Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines\r\nimposed, nor cruel and unusual punishment inflicted.\"\r\n\r\n(11) \"Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment\r\nfor crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist\r\nwithin the United States or any place subject to their jurisdiction.\"\r\n\r\n(12) \"The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be\r\ndenied or abridged by the United States, or by any State, on account of\r\nrace, color, or previous condition of servitude.\"\r\n\r\n(13) \"The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not\r\nbe construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nALIENS.\r\n\r\nAliens are subjects of foreign governments.  They are not citizens of\r\nthis country, and, in general, have no right to take part in its\r\npolitical affairs.  Throughout the Union aliens have full social and\r\nmoral rights; in some States their property rights are restricted; and\r\nin a few States they have certain political rights.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURE OF THE CONSTITUTION.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of the United States is the supreme law of the whole\r\nland.  It is a written instrument, and is often called the fundamental\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nNeither the laws of any State nor the laws of the United States must\r\nconflict with the Constitution.  It is the basis of our system of\r\ngovernment, the model upon which all State constitutions are framed,\r\nand the foundation of our greatness as a people.  It defines the limits\r\nof the national government, and enumerates the powers of each of its\r\ndepartments.  It declares what public interests are within the scope of\r\nthe national government, reserves certain powers to the States, and\r\nprovides that neither State nor nation shall enact certain specified\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\nFORMATION.--The national Constitution was framed by a convention of\r\ndelegates from twelve of the thirteen original States, Rhode Island\r\nalone being unrepresented.  The convention was called for the purpose\r\nof revising the Articles of Confederation under which the States were\r\nat the time united.\r\n\r\nThe convention met at Philadelphia, on Monday, May 14, 1787, and\r\norganized on the 25th day of the same month by electing as its\r\npresident George Washington, one of the delegates from Virginia.  The\r\nArticles of Confederation were readily seen to be inadequate to the\r\npurposes of a national government, and the convention proceeded to\r\ndraught a \"Constitution for the United States of America.\"\r\n\r\nThe convention completed its labors, submitted the Constitution to the\r\nseveral States for their ratification, and adjourned on the 17th of\r\nSeptember, 1787.  All the States ratified the Constitution, the last\r\nbeing Rhode Island, whose convention, called for the purpose, passed\r\nthe ordinance of ratification, May 29, 1790.\r\n\r\nNECESSITY.--The necessity for a written national constitution is\r\nreadily seen.  The preamble states the purposes of the Constitution,\r\nwhich are also the purposes of the national government.  The\r\nConstitution defines the limits of State and of national power, and\r\nthus prevents conflicts of authority which would otherwise arise\r\nbetween the State and the United States.  Through the Constitution, the\r\npeople, who are the sources of all just authority, grant to the\r\ngovernment certain powers, and reserve all other powers to themselves.\r\nThe Constitution prescribes the functions of each department of the\r\ngovernment, and thus preserves the liberties of the people by\r\npreventing either Congress, the executive department, or the judiciary\r\nfrom exercising powers not granted to it.\r\n\r\nAMENDMENT.--The Constitution prescribes two methods by which it may be\r\namended:\r\n\r\n1. By a two thirds vote of both houses Congress may propose to the\r\nseveral States amendments to the Constitution.\r\n\r\n2. Upon the application of two thirds of the States, Congress shall\r\ncall a convention of delegates from the several States for proposing\r\namendments.\r\n\r\nAn amendment proposed by either method, \"when ratified by the\r\nlegislatures of three fourths of the States, or by conventions in three\r\nfourths thereof, shall be valid to all intents and purposes as a part\r\nof this Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nTwenty-one amendments have been proposed by Congress, and seventeen of\r\nthese have been ratified by three fourths of the State legislatures,\r\nand have become parts of the Constitution.  The other four proposed\r\namendments were rejected.  Congress has never called a convention to\r\npropose amendments, and no State has ever called a convention to\r\nconsider those amendments proposed by Congress.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENTS.--The functions of each branch of government are carefully\r\nmarked in the Constitution, and the people and their representatives\r\njealously guard the rights of each department.  They believe that the\r\nduties of the law-making power, those of the law-enforcing power, and\r\nthose of the law-explaining power can not be too clearly separated.  If\r\nthe same officers could make the law, enforce the law, and explain the\r\nlaw, there would be no limit to their authority, and therefore no\r\nsecurity to the people.\r\n\r\nThe framers of the Constitution were wise men; they had seen the abuse\r\nof power by Great Britain while the colonies were under her sway, and\r\nthey determined to guard the liberties of the people by forever\r\nseparating the legislative, the executive, and the judicial functions.\r\nTheir example has been followed in the constitutions of all the States.\r\n\r\nThe President has no right to interfere with the decisions of the\r\ncourts, and, except by his veto, can not interfere with the action of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nCongress can not question the decisions of courts, nor can it interfere\r\nwith the legal actions of the President, except that the Senate may\r\nrefuse to confirm his appointments to office.\r\n\r\nEven the Supreme Court of the United States can not call in question\r\nthe official acts of the President, so long as he conforms to the law;\r\nnor has it any power over the acts of Congress, except merely to decide\r\nupon the constitutionality of the laws when they are properly brought\r\nbefore it.\r\n\r\nWhile, therefore, Congress and the President have some remote influence\r\nupon the actions of each other, neither has the slightest right to\r\ninvade the functions of the Supreme Court, or of any other court, even\r\nthe humblest in the land.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n1.

The senators represent the States, and the\r\nrepresentatives represent the people.  Congress holds annual sessions\r\nat the city of Washington, the seat of the national government.  A\r\nmeasure must pass both houses, and be approved by the President, in\r\norder to become a law; or if vetoed, it fails, unless it again passes\r\nboth houses by a two thirds vote.\r\n\r\nSenators and representatives receive an annual salary of seven thousand\r\nfive hundred dollars each; and are allowed mileage, or traveling\r\nexpenses, of twenty cents for each mile in going to and returning from\r\nthe session of Congress.\r\n\r\nPRIVILEGES OF THE HOUSES.--There are certain constitutional privileges\r\nguaranteed to Congress in order that its action in legislation may be\r\nfree from undue influence from other departments of the government.\r\n\r\n\"The times, places, and manner of holding elections for senators and\r\nrepresentatives shall be prescribed in each State by the legislature\r\nthereof; but the Congress may, at any time, by law, make or alter such\r\nregulations, except as to the places of choosing senators.\r\n\r\n\"Each house shall be the judge of the elections, returns, and\r\nqualifications of its own members;\" that is, each House declares who\r\nare entitled to membership therein.\r\n\r\n\"Each house may determine the rules of its proceedings, punish its\r\nmembers for disorderly conduct, and with the concurrence of two thirds\r\nexpel a member.\"\r\n\r\nEach house keeps and publishes a journal of its proceedings, \"excepting\r\nsuch parts as may, in their judgment, require secrecy; and the yeas and\r\nnays of the members of either house, on any question, shall, at the\r\ndesire of one fifth of those present, be entered on the journal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither house, during the session of Congress, shall, without the\r\nconsent of the other, adjourn for more than three days, nor to any\r\nother place than that in which the two houses shall be sitting.\"\r\n\r\nPRIVILEGES AND DISABILITIES OF MEMBERS.--The Constitution of the United\r\nStates sets forth the following privileges and disabilities relating to\r\nmembership in both the Senate and the House of Representatives:\r\n\r\n(1) \"The senators and representatives shall receive a compensation for\r\ntheir services, to be ascertained by law, and paid out of the treasury\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\n\"They shall in all cases except treason, felony, and breach of the\r\npeace be privileged from arrest during their attendance at the session\r\nof their respective houses, and in going to and returning from the\r\nsame; and for any speech or debate in either house they shall not be\r\nquestioned in any other place.\"\r\n\r\n(2) \"No senator or representative shall, during the time for which he\r\nwas elected, be appointed to any civil office under the authority of\r\nthe United States which shall have been created, or the emoluments\r\nwhereof shall have been increased, during such time; and no person\r\nholding any office under the United States shall be a member of either\r\nhouse during his continuance of office.\"\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the first part of this clause is to prevent members of\r\nCongress from voting to create offices, or to affix high salaries to\r\noffices, with the hope of being appointed to fill them.\r\n\r\n(3) \"The senators and representatives before mentioned, and the members\r\nof the several State legislatures, and all executive and judicial\r\nofficers both of the United States and of the several States, shall be\r\nbound by oath or affirmation to support this Constitution; but no\r\nreligious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office\r\nor public trust under the United States.\"\r\n\r\n(4) \"No person shall be a senator or representative in Congress, or\r\nelector of President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or\r\nmilitary, under the United States, or under any State, who, having\r\npreviously taken an oath as a member of Congress, or as an officer of\r\nthe United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an\r\nexecutive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution\r\nof the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion\r\nagainst the same, or given aid and comfort to the enemies thereof.  But\r\nCongress may, by a vote of two thirds of each House, remove such\r\ndisability.\"\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the clause was to exclude from office all those who had\r\nsworn, as officers of the State or the nation, to support the\r\nConstitution of the United States, and who afterward engaged in war\r\nagainst the Union.  An act of Congress enabling them to hold office was\r\ncalled a removal of their disabilities.  This clause of the\r\nConstitution is practically void as regards all past offenses, as the\r\ndisabilities of nearly all to whom it applied have been removed by\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nPOWERS OF CONGRESS.--Congress has power:\r\n\r\n(1) To _levy and collect taxes_, duties on imported goods, and revenues\r\nfrom articles of manufacture, \"to pay the debts and provide for the\r\ncommon defense and general welfare of the United States.\"\r\n\r\n(2) \"To _borrow money_ on the credit of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nThe usual method of borrowing money is to issue government bonds, which\r\nare promises to pay the sums specified in them at a given time, with\r\ninterest at a given rate.  The bonds are sold, usually at their face\r\nvalue, and the proceeds applied to public purposes.  United States\r\nbonds can not be taxed by a State.\r\n\r\n(3) \"To _regulate commerce_ with foreign nations, and among the several\r\nStates, and with the Indian tribes.\"\r\n\r\n(4) \"To establish a uniform rule of _naturalisation_, and uniform laws\r\non the subject of bankruptcies, throughout the United States.\"\r\n\r\n(5) \"To _coin money_; regulate the value thereof, and of foreign coin;\r\nand fix the standard of weights and measures.\"\r\n\r\n(6) \"To provide for the _punishment of counterfeiting_ the securities\r\nand current coin of the United States.\"\r\n\r\n(7) \"To establish _post-offices_ and post-roads.\"\r\n\r\n(8) \"To promote the progress of _science and useful arts_, by securing\r\nfor limited times, to authors and inventors, the exclusive right to\r\ntheir respective writings and discoveries;\"\r\n\r\nThat is, to grant _copyrights_ to authors, and to issue _patents_ to\r\ninventors.\r\n\r\n(9) \"To constitute _tribunals_ inferior to the supreme court.\"\r\n\r\n(10) \"To define and punish _piracies and felonies_ committed on the\r\nhigh seas, and offenses against the law of nations.\"\r\n\r\n_Piracy_ is robbery committed at sea.\r\n\r\n(11) \"To _declare war_; grant letters of marque and reprisal, and make\r\nrules concerning captures on land and water.\"\r\n\r\n_Letters of marque_ are commissions issued to private parties,\r\nauthorizing them to cross the frontiers of another nation, and to seize\r\nthe persons and property of its subjects.\r\n\r\n_Reprisal_ is the forcible taking of the property or persons of the\r\nsubjects of another nation, in return for injuries done to the\r\ngovernment granting the letters.  Vessels carrying letters of marque\r\nand reprisal are called _privateers_.\r\n\r\n(12) \"To raise and support _armies_.\"\r\n\r\n(13) \"To provide and maintain a _navy_.\"\r\n\r\n(14) \"To make rules for the government and regulation of the land and\r\nnaval forces.\"\r\n\r\n(15) \"To provide for calling forth the _militia_ to execute the laws of\r\nthe Union, suppress insurrection and repel invasions.\"\r\n\r\n(16) \"To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia,\r\nand for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service\r\nof the United States.\"\r\n\r\n(17) \"To exercise exclusive legislation\" over the _District of\r\nColumbia_, \"and to exercise like authority over all places purchased by\r\nthe consent of the legislature of the State in which the same shall be,\r\nfor the erection of forts, magazines, arsenals, dockyards, and other\r\nneedful buildings.\"\r\n\r\n(18) \"To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying\r\ninto execution the foregoing powers and all other powers vested by this\r\nConstitution in the government of the United States, or in any\r\ndepartment or officer thereof.\"\r\n\r\n(19) \"Congress may determine the time of choosing the _electors_\" for\r\nPresident and Vice President of the United States, \"and the day on\r\nwhich they shall give their votes, which day shall be the same\r\nthroughout the United States.\"\r\n\r\n(20) \"Congress may, by law, provide for the case of removal, death,\r\nresignation, or inability of both the President and Vice President,\r\ndeclaring what officer shall then act as President.\"\r\n\r\n(21) \"The Congress may, by law, vest the appointment of such _inferior\r\nofficers_ as they think proper, in the President alone, in the courts\r\nof law, or in the heads of departments.\"\r\n\r\n(22) \"The Congress shall have power to declare the punishment of\r\n_treason_.\"\r\n\r\n(23) \"Full _faith and credit_ shall be given in each State, to the\r\npublic acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other State.\r\nAnd the Congress may, by general laws, prescribe the manner in which\r\nsuch acts, records, and proceedings shall be proved, and the effect\r\nthereof.\"\r\n\r\n(24) \"_New States_ may be admitted by the Congress into this Union, but\r\nno new State shall be formed or erected within the jurisdiction of any\r\nother State, nor any State be formed by the junction of two or more\r\nStates, or parts of States, without the consent of the legislatures of\r\nthe States concerned, as well as of the Congress.\"\r\n\r\n(25) \"The Congress shall have power to dispose of, and to make all\r\nneedful rules and regulations respecting the _territory_ or other\r\nproperty belonging to the United States; and nothing in this\r\nConstitution shall be so construed as to prejudice any claims of the\r\nUnited States or of any particular State.\"\r\n\r\n(26) Congress has \"power to enforce, by appropriate legislation,\" all\r\nprovisions of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nUnder the authority \"to provide for the general welfare of the United\r\nStates,\" Congress exercises powers which are implied--that is,\r\nunderstood--but which are not expressly named in the Constitution.  The\r\ngrants of public lands to railway and canal companies, the annual\r\nappropriations for the improvement of rivers and harbors, and numerous\r\nsimilar laws are based upon implied powers.\r\n\r\nFORBIDDEN POWERS.--The following powers are expressly denied to the\r\nnational government:\r\n\r\n(1) \"The privilege of the writ of _habeas corpus_ shall not be\r\nsuspended unless when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public\r\nsafety may require it.\"\r\n\r\n_Habeas corpus_ means \"Thou mayst have the body.\"  A person in prison,\r\nclaiming to be unlawfully detained, or the friend of such a person,\r\napplies to the judge of a court for a writ of _habeas corpus_.  The\r\njudge issues the writ, which directs the officer to bring the body of\r\nthe prisoner into court at a certain time and place, in order that the\r\nlegality of the imprisonment may be tested.\r\n\r\nThe case against the prisoner is not tried under the writ of _habeas\r\ncorpus_, but the judge inquires whether any crime is charged, or\r\nwhether there is a legal cause for the arrest.  If the imprisonment is\r\nillegal, the judge orders the prisoner released; if the prisoner is\r\nlawfully held, the judge remands him to prison.  This writ secures the\r\nfreedom of every person unless detained upon legal charges.  Therefore,\r\nthere is no power in this wide country that can arrest and imprison\r\neven the humblest citizen except upon legal grounds.  The writ of\r\n_habeas corpus_ is the most famous writ known to the law, the strongest\r\nsafeguard of the personal liberty of the citizens, and is regarded with\r\nalmost a sacred reverence by the people.\r\n\r\n(2) \"No bill of attainder or _ex post facto_ law shall be passed\" by\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nA _bill of attainder_ is an act of a legislative body inflicting the\r\npenalty of death without a regular trial.  An _ex post facto_ law is a\r\nlaw which fixes a penalty for acts done before the law was passed, or\r\nwhich increases the penalty of a crime after it is committed.  Laws for\r\npunishing crime more severely can take effect only after their passage;\r\nthey can not affect a crime committed before they were passed.\r\n\r\n(3) \"No tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from any State.\r\nNo preference shall be given, by any regulation of commerce or revenue,\r\nto the ports of one State over those of another; nor shall vessels\r\nbound to or from one State be obliged to enter, clear, or pay duties in\r\nanother.\"\r\n\r\n(4) \"No money shall be drawn from the treasury but in consequence of\r\nappropriations made by law, and a regular statement and account of the\r\nreceipts and expenditures of all public money shall be published from\r\ntime to time.\"\r\n\r\n(5) \"No title of nobility shall be granted by the United States, and no\r\nperson holding any office of profit or trust under them shall, without\r\nthe consent of Congress, accept of any present, emolument, office, or\r\ntitle of any kind whatever, from any king, prince, or foreign State.\"\r\n\r\n(6) \"Congress shall make no law respecting establishment of religion,\r\nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of\r\nspeech or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to\r\nassemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.\"\r\n\r\n(7) \"The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized\r\nby law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties\r\nfor services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion shall not be\r\nquestioned.  But neither the United States nor any State shall assume\r\nor pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or\r\nrebellion against the United States, or any claim for the loss or\r\nemancipation of any slave; but all such debts, obligations, and claims\r\nshall be held illegal and void.\"\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of the United States forbids the national government\r\nfrom exercising certain other powers, relating principally to slavery;\r\nbut such denials are rendered useless by the freedom of the slaves.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNITED STATES SENATE.\r\n\r\nThe Senate is composed of two senators from each State, elected by\r\ndirect vote of the people;[1] and therefore each State has an equal\r\nrepresentation, without regard to its area or the number of its people.\r\n\r\nThe term of a United States senator is six years, and one third of the\r\nSenate is elected every two years.\r\n\r\nA senator must be thirty years old, for nine years a citizen of the\r\nUnited States, and must be an inhabitant of the State for which he\r\nshall be chosen.\r\n\r\nA vacancy which occurs in any State's representation in the United\r\nStates Senate is filled by an election for the unexpired term; but the\r\nlegislature of any State may empower the governor to make temporary\r\nappointments until such election is held.\r\n\r\nThe Vice President of the United States is _ex officio_ president of\r\nthe Senate, but has no vote except when the Senate is equally divided\r\nupon a question.  The Senate elects its other officers, including a\r\npresident _pro tempore_, or temporary president, who presides when the\r\nVice President is absent.\r\n\r\nThe Senate is a continuous body; that is, it is always organized, and\r\nwhen it meets it may proceed at once to business.\r\n\r\nWhen the House of Representatives impeaches an officer of the United\r\nStates, the impeachment is tried before the Senate sitting as a court.\r\n\r\nThe Senate has the sole power to try impeachments, and it requires two\r\nthirds of the senators present to convict.  Judgment in cases of\r\nimpeachment shall not extend further than to removal from office, and\r\ndisqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or\r\nprofit under the United States; but the party convicted shall,\r\nnevertheless, be liable and subject to indictment, trial, judgment, and\r\npunishment according to law.\r\n\r\nAll treaties made by the President of the United States with foreign\r\ncountries must be laid before the Senate for ratification.  If two\r\nthirds of the Senate vote for the treaty, it is ratified; otherwise, it\r\nis rejected.\r\n\r\nTreaties are compacts or contracts between two or more nations made\r\nwith a view to the public welfare of each, and are usually formed by\r\nagents or commissioners appointed by the respective governments of the\r\ncountries concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.\r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives, often called the lower House of Congress,\r\nis a much larger body than the Senate.  The last apportionment of\r\nrepresentatives, made in 1911, gave the House four hundred and\r\nthirty-five members, and this went into effect with the Sixty-third\r\nCongress, beginning on the 4th of March, 1913.\r\n\r\nA census of the people is made every ten years, and upon this as a\r\nbasis Congress fixes the number of representatives for the entire\r\ncountry, and the number to which each State shall be entitled for the\r\nnext ten years thereafter.  Each legislature divides the State into as\r\nmany Congress districts as the State is entitled to representatives,\r\nand each district elects a representative by direct vote of the people.\r\n\r\nThe term of office is two years, and the terms of all representatives\r\nbegin and end at the same time.\r\n\r\nA representative must be twenty-five years old, must have been a\r\ncitizen of the United States seven years, and must be an inhabitant of\r\nthe State in which he is elected.\r\n\r\nA vacancy in a State's representation in the lower house of Congress is\r\nfilled by special election called by the governor for that purpose.\r\n\r\n\"All bills for raising revenue\"--that is, all bills providing for\r\ntaxation--\"must originate in the House of Representatives; but the\r\nSenate may propose or concur with amendments, as in other bills.\"\r\nTaxation is called the strongest function of government, and therefore\r\nthe Constitution provides that the first step must be taken by the\r\nHouse of Representatives, because all its members are elected every two\r\nyears by the people, and are supposed to represent the people's views.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution provides that \"the House of Representatives shall have\r\nthe sole power of impeachment;\" that is, the House of Representatives\r\nmust formulate and present the charges to the Senate, and prosecute the\r\naccused at its bar.  An impeachment by the House of Representatives\r\ncorresponds to an indictment by a grand jury; specific charges must be\r\nmade before a trial can be held in any court.\r\n\r\nTHE SPEAKER.--The speaker is elected by the representatives.  He is a\r\nmember of the House, and is nominated for the speakership by a\r\nconvention, or _caucus_, of the representatives who are of his\r\npolitical party.  In rank he is the third officer of the government.\r\nHe presides over the House, preserves decorum, decides points of order,\r\nand directs the business of legislation.  He is the organ of the House,\r\nand because he speaks and declares its will is called the _Speaker_.\r\nHe formerly appointed the standing committees of the House, and thus\r\nlargely shaped legislation; but this power was taken from him in 1911.\r\nAs almost all laws are matured by the committees, and are passed as the\r\nresult of their work, the power to appoint the committees was\r\nconsidered too important to leave in the hands of one man.  The\r\nspeaker's salary is $12,000 annually.\r\n\r\nThe clerk of the preceding House presides during the election of the\r\nspeaker.  Immediately after his election, the speaker is sworn into\r\noffice by the representative of the longest service in the House.  He\r\nthen assumes the direction of business, and administers the oath to the\r\nmembers as they present themselves by States.  The House of\r\nRepresentatives is reorganized every two years at the opening of the\r\nfirst session of each Congress.\r\n\r\nOTHER OFFICERS.--The other officers of the House are the clerk, the\r\nsergeant-at-arms, the doorkeeper, the postmaster, and the chaplain.\r\nThey are not members of the House.  The sergeant-at-arms and the\r\ndoorkeeper appoint numerous subordinates.\r\n\r\nThe sergeant-at-arms is the ministerial and police officer of the\r\nHouse.  He preserves order, under the direction of the speaker, and\r\nexecutes all processes issued by the House or its committees.  The\r\nsymbol of authority of the House is the mace, consisting of a bundle of\r\nebony rods surmounted by a globe, upon which is a silver eagle with\r\noutstretched wings.  In scenes of disturbance, when the\r\nsergeant-at-arms bears the mace through the hall of the House at the\r\nspeaker's command, the members immediately become quiet and order is\r\nrestored.\r\n\r\nThe doorkeeper has charge of the hall of the House and its entrances.\r\nThe postmaster receives and distributes the mail matter of the members.\r\nThe chaplain opens the daily sessions of the House with prayer.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]After 1913.  Before 1913 the senators of each State were elected by\r\nthe legislature.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n1.

Each\r\nparty meets in national convention later on in the year, and nominates\r\nthe candidates whom it will support for President and Vice President,\r\nand puts forth a declaration of principles called a \"platform.\"\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday after the first Monday in November the people of the several\r\nStates meet at their usual polling-places, and elect as many electors\r\nof President and Vice President as the State has senators and\r\nrepresentatives in Congress.  For this purpose candidates for electors\r\nhave previously been nominated by the several parties naming candidates\r\nfor President and Vice President.\r\n\r\nThe election returns are forwarded to the State capital, where they are\r\ncompared, and the result declared by the election board of the State.\r\nThe governor and secretary Of State issue certificates to the persons\r\nchosen as electors of President and Vice President.\r\n\r\nOn the second Monday in January the electors of each State meet at the\r\nState capital and cast their votes for the candidates of their party\r\nfor President and Vice President.  They make, sign, certify, and seal\r\nthree separate lists of their votes for President and Vice President;\r\ntransmit two lists to the president of the United States Senate--one by\r\nmail and the other by special messenger--and file the remaining list\r\nwith the judge of the United States district court of the district in\r\nwhich the electors meet.\r\n\r\nOn the second Wednesday in February the United States Senate and House\r\nof Representatives meet in joint session.  The president of the Senate\r\nopens the certificates of votes from all the States, and the votes are\r\nthen counted.  The person having the highest number of votes for\r\nPresident is declared elected President, if his votes are a majority of\r\nall the electors elected in the whole Union.\r\n\r\nIf no person receives a majority of all the electoral votes, then the\r\nHouse of Representatives elects the President from the three candidates\r\nreceiving the highest numbers of votes.  A quorum for the purpose is a\r\nrepresentative or representatives from two thirds of the States.  Each\r\nState has one vote, cast as a majority of its representatives present\r\ndirects; and a majority of ail the States is necessary to elect.\r\n\r\nThe person receiving the highest number of votes for Vice President is\r\nelected Vice President, if his votes are a majority of the whole number\r\nof electors chosen.\r\n\r\nIf his votes are not a majority of all the electors, then the Senate\r\nproceeds to elect the Vice President from the two candidates receiving\r\nthe highest number of votes for Vice President.  A quorum for the\r\npurpose consists of two thirds of the senators from all the States.\r\nEach senator has one vote, and a majority of the whole number is\r\nnecessary to elect.\r\n\r\nThe people do not vote directly for President and Vice President, but\r\nfor electors by whom the President and the Vice President are chosen.\r\nThe electors of all the States are called collectively the _electoral\r\ncollege_.\r\n\r\nThe electors _may_ vote for some other person than the candidate\r\nnominated by their respective parties; but no elector has ever chosen\r\nto exercise this privilege.  They consider themselves in honor pledged\r\nand instructed to cast their votes for the candidate of their own\r\npolitical faith.\r\n\r\nThe vote of the people for electors is called the _popular vote_, and\r\nthe vote of the electors for President is called the _electoral vote_.\r\nAs has several times happened in our history, a candidate may be\r\nelected President or Vice President and yet be in a minority of the\r\npopular vote.\r\n\r\nINAUGURATION.--On the 4th of March following the election the President\r\nand the Vice President assume the duties of their respective offices\r\namid imposing ceremonies.\r\n\r\nThe Vice President is first sworn into office in the presence of the\r\nUnited States Senate.  The following oath of office is then\r\nadministered to the President-elect by the Chief Justice of the United\r\nStates Supreme Court: \"I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will\r\nfaithfully execute the office of President of the United States; and\r\nwill, to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the\r\nConstitution of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nIn the presence of a vast concourse of citizens the President delivers\r\nan address, outlining the public policy to be pursued during his term\r\nof office.  There is usually a display of civil and military\r\norganizations representing all sections of the country.  The political\r\ndifferences of the people are in great part forgotten in the enthusiasm\r\nattending the inauguration of the President.\r\n\r\nOFFICIAL RESIDENCE.--The presidential mansion in the city of Washington\r\nis called the White House.  It was erected and is maintained by the\r\nnational government at public expense.  Here the President resides with\r\nhis family, and receives private citizens, members of Congress,\r\nofficers of other departments of the government, and foreign ministers\r\nand dignitaries.\r\n\r\nAt his public receptions, held at stated times, he may be called upon\r\nby the humblest person in the land.  This shows the spirit of equality\r\nwhich prevails even in the highest station under our system of\r\ngovernment.  Our institutions are based upon the principle embodied in\r\nthe Declaration of Independence, \"That all men are created equal.\"\r\n\r\nDIGNITY AND RESPONSIBILITY.--The office of President of the United\r\nStates is the highest in the gift of the people.  \"He represents the\r\nunity, power, and purpose of the nation.\"  He is the first citizen of\r\nthe United States, holding the position of highest dignity, influence,\r\nand responsibility in the whole country.  He directs the machinery of\r\nthe government, and is therefore held responsible by the people for the\r\nconduct of public affairs, and largely for the condition of the country.\r\n\r\nHis term of office is called an administration.  He and his official\r\nadvisers have the appointment of more than one hundred and fifteen\r\nthousand officers of the national government.\r\n\r\nMESSAGES.--At the opening of each regular session of Congress the\r\nPresident sends or delivers to both houses his annual message, in which\r\nhe reviews events of the previous year, gives \"information of the state\r\nof the Union,\" and recommends the passage of such laws as he deems\r\n\"necessary and expedient.\"  From time to time he gives information upon\r\nspecial subjects, and recommends the passage of measures of pressing\r\nimportance.  The heads of departments make yearly reports to the\r\nPresident, which are printed for the information of Congress.\r\n\r\nDUTIES AND POWERS.--The duties of the President are so extensive, the\r\nburdens of his office so heavy, and his power so great, that the people\r\nbelieve that no man, however wise and eminent, should hold the office\r\nfor more than two terms.  Washington set the example of voluntary\r\nretirement at the end of the second term, and it seems to be an\r\nunwritten law that no President shall serve more than eight years in\r\nsuccession.  The duties of the office, so various and so burdensome,\r\nare summed up in the provision of the Constitution: \"He shall take care\r\nthat the laws be faithfully executed.\"\r\n\r\nThe President approves or vetoes all bills and joint-resolutions passed\r\nby Congress, except those relating to questions of adjournment.  All\r\nmeasures vetoed must, within ten days after they are received, be\r\nreturned to the house in which they originated.  The power to veto acts\r\nof Congress is called the legislative power of the President.\r\n\r\nHe is _commander-in-chief_ of the army and the navy of the United\r\nStates, and of the militia of the several States when engaged in the\r\nnational service.  He does not command in person, but places the forces\r\nunder the orders of officers of his choice.\r\n\r\nHe may require information in writing from the heads of departments\r\nupon subjects relating to their respective offices.  As he appoints\r\nthese officers, and may remove them at his pleasure, the people hold\r\nhim responsible for their official conduct.  He is held responsible for\r\nthe official actions of all officers of the executive department of the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nHe may grant _reprieves and pardons_ for offenses against the United\r\nStates, except in cases of impeachment.  Frequent appeals are made to\r\nhis pardoning power.\r\n\r\nHe may make _treaties_ with foreign countries, but before a treaty can\r\nhave any effect it must be submitted by him to the Senate, and must be\r\nratified by a vote of two thirds of the senators present.  With the\r\nconsent of the Senate, he appoints ministers to foreign courts, consuls\r\nto foreign countries, judges of the United States Supreme Court, and\r\nother officers, of the national government.  He fills vacancies in\r\noffice which occur during recesses of the Senate, by granting\r\ncommissions which expire at the close of the next session of the Senate.\r\n\r\nHe may, in cases of extreme necessity, call special session of\r\nCongress, or of either house.  If the Senate and the House of\r\nRepresentatives fail to agree upon a time to which they shall adjourn,\r\nthe President may adjourn them to such time as he may think proper.\r\nSuch a necessity has never arisen, and therefore this power has never\r\nbeen exercised.\r\n\r\nThe President may receive or refuse to receive ministers and other\r\nagents of foreign governments.  _To receive_ a minister is to recognize\r\nthe nation which he represents.  He may also dismiss foreign ministers\r\nwho do not prove acceptable to our government.\r\n\r\nHe commissions all officers of the United States.  The power to make\r\nappointments of office is called his _patronage_.  A civil service\r\ncommission, consisting of three commissioners, has been established by\r\nact of Congress, to secure efficiency in the public service, and to\r\nprevent the appointment of men to office as a reward for party work.\r\nBefore applicants for certain offices can be appointed they must pass\r\nan examination prescribed by the civil service commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nCABINET.\r\n\r\nThe President's cabinet is a council of ten official advisers,\r\nappointed by him and confirmed by the Senate.  They are often called\r\nheads of departments.  The members of the cabinet are the secretary of\r\nstate, secretary of the treasury, secretary of war, secretary of the\r\nnavy, postmaster-general, secretary of the interior, attorney-general,\r\nsecretary of agriculture, secretary of commerce, and secretary of labor.\r\n\r\nThey may be removed by the President at pleasure, and are directly\r\nresponsible to him for the conduct of their respective departments.\r\nThe President holds frequent meetings of the cabinet for the purpose of\r\nconferring upon official business; but he may, if he choose, disregard\r\ntheir advice and act upon his own judgment.\r\n\r\nIn case of the death, resignation, removal, or disability of both\r\nPresident and Vice President, the presidential office would be filled\r\nby a member of the cabinet, in this order: The secretary of state, the\r\nsecretary of the treasury, the secretary of war, the attorney-general,\r\nthe postmaster-general, the secretary of the navy, the secretary of the\r\ninterior.\r\n\r\nEach of the cabinet officers receives a salary of twelve thousand\r\ndollars per year.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE.--The secretary of state is the head of the\r\ndepartment of state, formerly called the department of foreign affairs.\r\nHis office is the highest rank in the cabinet, and is next in\r\nimportance to that of the President.  He preserves the original\r\ndraughts of all treaties, laws, public documents, and correspondence\r\nwith foreign countries.  He keeps the great seal of the United States,\r\nand fixes it to all commissions signed by the President.  He furnishes\r\ncopies of records and papers kept in his office, impressed with the\r\nseal of his department, and authenticates all proclamations and\r\nmessages of the President.\r\n\r\nHe has charge of the negotiation of treaties and other foreign affairs,\r\nconducts correspondence with foreign ministers, issues instructions for\r\nthe guidance of our ministers and other agents to foreign countries,\r\nand from time to time reports to Congress the relations of the United\r\nStates with other governments.  He is the organ of communication\r\nbetween the President and the governors of the States.\r\n\r\nHe issues traveling papers, called _passports_, to citizens wishing to\r\ntravel in foreign countries.  When foreign criminals take refuge in\r\nthis country, he issues warrants for their delivery according to the\r\nterms of existing treaties.  He presents to the President all foreign\r\nministers, and is the only officer authorized to represent him in\r\ncorrespondence with foreign governments.\r\n\r\nThe secretary of state has three assistants, called respectively, first\r\nassistant secretary of state, second assistant secretary of state, and\r\nthird assistant secretary of state.\r\n\r\nThe department of state conducts the foreign affairs of the government\r\nchiefly through the diplomatic service and the consular service.\r\n\r\nTHE DIPLOMATIC SERVICE.--The officers of the diplomatic service are\r\ncalled _ministers_, and represent the United States in a political\r\ncapacity.  They negotiate treaties under the direction of the secretary\r\nof state, and maintain friendly relations between the United States and\r\nthe countries to which they are accredited.  They are forbidden to\r\nengage in any commercial transaction, or to exercise any control over\r\nthe commercial interests of the United States.\r\n\r\nBy the laws of nations, foreign ministers in all countries enjoy many\r\nrights and privileges not accorded to other foreign persons.  They are\r\nassisted by interpreters, who explain speeches made in foreign tongues;\r\nand by secretaries of legation, who keep the records, and attend to the\r\nminor duties of the ministers.\r\n\r\nThe diplomatic service consists of ambassadors extraordinary and\r\nplenipotentiary, of envoys extraordinary and ministers plenipotentiary,\r\nand of ministers resident.  These officials rank in the order named,\r\nbut the duties are the same; the chief difference being in the rank and\r\ninfluence of the countries to which they are accredited.\r\n\r\nThe ambassadors and ministers of the higher rank receive salaries\r\nranging from seven thousand five hundred dollars to seventeen thousand\r\nfive hundred dollars each, the latter sum being paid to the ambassadors\r\nto such important countries as Great Britain, Germany, France, Russia,\r\nMexico, Japan, etc.\r\n\r\nThere are very few ministers resident.  They generally serve also as\r\nconsuls general, and receive from four thousand dollars to seven\r\nthousand dollars each.  Ministers sent to foreign countries upon\r\nspecial service, such as the negotiation of special treaties, are\r\nsometimes called _commissioners_.\r\n\r\nCONSULAR SERVICE.--The consular service includes about sixty consuls\r\ngeneral, some of whom are inspectors of consulates, about two hundred\r\nand fifty consuls, and many deputies and other assistants.\r\n\r\nThe chief duties of consuls are to enforce the commercial laws, and to\r\nprotect the rights of American citizens.  Consuls reside at the\r\nprincipal cities of the consular districts to which they are\r\naccredited.  The interests of American shipping and American seamen are\r\nspecially intrusted to their care.  They keep the papers of American\r\nvessels while in port; they record the tonnage, the kind and value of\r\nthe cargo, and the number and condition of the sailors.  They hear the\r\ncomplaints of seamen, cause the arrest of mutinous sailors, send them\r\nhome for trial, and care for mariners in destitute condition.  They\r\ntake possession of the property of American citizens dying abroad, and\r\nforward the proceeds to the lawful heirs.\r\n\r\nThey collect valuable information relating to the commerce and\r\nmanufactures of foreign countries, which is distributed among our\r\npeople by the department of commerce.\r\n\r\nIn Turkey and China, American citizens who are charged with crime are\r\ntried by the American consul.  Consuls and consuls general receive\r\nsalaries ranging from two thousand dollars to twelve thousand dollars\r\neach, according to the importance of the cities where they are located.\r\n\r\nTREASURY DEPARTMENT.--The secretary of the treasury is the head of the\r\ntreasury department.  He manages the entire financial system of the\r\nnational government.  He suggests to Congress plans for raising revenue\r\nand maintaining the credit of the United States, and makes detailed\r\nreports on all the operations of his department.\r\n\r\nHe superintends the collection of revenue; the coinage of money; the\r\noperation of national banks; the conduct of custom-houses, where taxes\r\non imported foreign goods are collected.  The schedule or table showing\r\nthe duties levied on foreign goods is called the _tariff_; this is\r\nfixed by act of Congress.  The management of the public health service,\r\nand the operation of the coast guard, maintained along the seacoast for\r\nthe rescue of persons from drowning and for the enforcement of\r\nnavigation laws, are also under the charge of the secretary of the\r\ntreasury.  His greatest responsibility is the management of the\r\nnational debt, which still amounts to many hundred millions of dollars.\r\n\r\nBUREAUS.--The secretary of the treasury is assisted by three assistant\r\nsecretaries of the treasury, a comptroller, six auditors, a treasurer,\r\na register of the treasury, and numerous other responsible officers in\r\ncharge of the bank currency, internal revenue, the mint, the erection\r\nof public buildings, and other important bureaus and divisions of the\r\ntreasury department.\r\n\r\nThe _comptroller_ directs the work of the six auditors, and\r\nsuperintends the recovery of debts due the United States.\r\n\r\nThe _auditor for the treasury department_ settles--that is, examines\r\nand passes on--all accounts in the collection of customs duties and\r\ninternal revenue, the national debt, and other accounts immediately\r\nconnected with the operations of the treasury department.\r\n\r\nThe _auditor for the war department_ settles the army accounts.\r\n\r\nThe _auditor for the interior department_ settles pension accounts,\r\naccounts with the Indians, and all other accounts arising in the\r\ndepartment of the interior.\r\n\r\nThe _auditor for the navy department_ settles the accounts of the navy.\r\n\r\nThe _auditor for the state and other departments_ has charge of the\r\naccounts of the secretary of state, the attorney-general, the secretary\r\nof agriculture, the secretary of commerce, and the secretary of labor,\r\nand of all the officials under their direction; the accounts of the\r\nUnited States courts; and those of various institutions which are not\r\nunder the control of any department.\r\n\r\nThe _auditor for the post-office department_ examines and passes on the\r\naccounts of the postal service.\r\n\r\nThe _treasurer_ is custodian of the funds of the United States.  All\r\nfunds and securities are kept in vaults made for the purpose, or\r\ndeposited in reliable banks for safe keeping.\r\n\r\nThe _register of the treasury_ has charge of the account-books of\r\nUnited States bonds and paper money.  They show the exact financial\r\ncondition of the United States at all times.  The register's name is\r\nupon all bonds and notes issued by the government.\r\n\r\nThe _comptroller of the currency_ supervises the national banks.  A\r\n_bank_ is a place for the safe keeping and lending of money.  A bank\r\nholding its charter--that is, its power to do business--from a State\r\ngovernment is called a State bank.  Two kinds of banks are chartered by\r\nthe national government: the _national banks_ and the _federal reserve\r\nbanks_.\r\n\r\nBy the laws of the United States, any five or more persons with\r\nsufficient capital may organize a national bank.  A national bank may\r\nissue its notes--that is, its promises to pay--as currency, to an\r\namount not exceeding the amount of United States bonds deposited by the\r\nbank with the national government.  Each federal reserve bank is a\r\nlarge central bank organized by the banks of a certain district.  It\r\nissues notes as currency, secured by commercial notes, drafts, etc.\r\n\r\nThe _commissioner of internal revenue_ supervises the collection of\r\nincome taxes and of taxes laid upon tobacco; liquors, etc.,\r\nmanufactured in this country.\r\n\r\nThe _director of the mint_ has charge of the coinage of money, and\r\nreports to Congress upon the yield of precious metals.  There are mints\r\nat Philadelphia, Carson, San Francisco, Denver, and New Orleans, and\r\nassay offices also at other places.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution vests the power to coin money in the national\r\ngovernment alone.\r\n\r\nThe _director of the bureau of engraving and printing_ supervises the\r\nexecution of designs and the engraving and printing of revenue and\r\npostage stamps, national bank notes, and the notes, bonds, and other\r\nfinancial paper of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe _supervising architect_ selects plans for the erection of\r\ncustom-houses, court-houses, post-offices, mints, and other public\r\nbuildings of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe _surgeon-general of the public health service_ has charge of the\r\nmarine hospitals, and helps to enforce the laws which aim to prevent\r\nthe introduction of contagious diseases into the country.  He calls\r\nconferences of state health boards.\r\n\r\nThe _solicitor of the treasury_ is the chief lawyer for the department.\r\nHe has charge of prosecutions for violations of the customs laws, and\r\nother crimes against the financial interests of the United States.\r\nLike similar lawyers for other departments, he is included in the\r\ndepartment of justice, under the attorney-general.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT.--The secretary of war is the head of the war\r\ndepartment.  He has charge of the land forces, under the direction of\r\nthe President.  He supervises the expenditure of money voted by\r\nCongress for the improvement of rivers and harbors, and for the United\r\nStates Military Academy at West Point, as well as for the support and\r\noperations of the army.  In the management of his department he is\r\naided by an assistant secretary of war.\r\n\r\nBUREAUS.--The war department has numerous offices and bureaus, each in\r\nthe charge of a responsible officer, and all under the supervision of\r\nthe Chief of Staff, who is the military adviser of the secretary of war.\r\n\r\nThe _adjutant-general_ issues the military orders of his superiors,\r\nconducts the army correspondence, issues commissions, and keeps the\r\narmy records.\r\n\r\nThe _quartermaster-general_ provides quarters, food, clothing, and\r\ntransportation for the army, and has charge of barracks and national\r\ncemeteries.  He also supervises the payment of the army and the\r\nmilitary academy.\r\n\r\nThe _surgeon-general_ superintends the army hospitals, and the\r\ndistribution of medical stores for the army.\r\n\r\nThe _inspector-general_ attends to inspection of the arms and\r\nequipments of the soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe _chief of engineers_ supervises the construction of forts, the\r\nimprovement of rivers and harbors, and the surveys relating to them.\r\n\r\nThe _chief of ordnance_ furnishes guns and ammunition to the army and\r\nto forts, and has charge of armories and arsenals.\r\n\r\nThe _judge-advocate-general_, who is chief of the bureau of military\r\njustice, prosecutes crimes committed in the army, and reviews all\r\nsentences passed by military courts and military commissions.\r\n\r\nMILITARY ACADEMY.--The military academy at West Point is maintained for\r\nthe education of officers for the army.  Each member of Congress\r\nappoints two cadets to the academy, and the President appoints four\r\nfrom the District of Columbia and eighty from the United States at\r\nlarge.  There are also appointed two from each territory, two from\r\nPorto Rico, and a certain number of enlisted men from the army.  The\r\nacademy is under the charge of an army officer, appointed by the\r\nsecretary of war.  Each cadet receives from the government an allowance\r\nsufficient to pay all necessary expenses.\r\n\r\nNAVY DEPARTMENT.--The secretary of the navy presides over the navy\r\ndepartment.  He has control of all affairs relating to vessels of war,\r\nthe naval forces, and naval operations.  He has charge of the Naval\r\nObservatory at Washington, and of the United States Naval Academy at\r\nAnnapolis.  There is an assistant secretary of the navy.\r\n\r\nThe naval department issues sailing charts, sailing directions, and\r\nother publications for the use of seamen.  Among these is the nautical\r\nalmanac used in navigating ships.\r\n\r\nBUREAUS.--The naval department has a number of bureaus, which are in\r\ncharge of competent officers detailed from the naval service.\r\n\r\nThe _bureau of navigation_ gives out and enforces the secretary's\r\norders to the officers of the navy, enlists sailors, keeps the records\r\nof the service, and has charge of the naval academy.  It has charge of\r\nthe training and education of line officers and enlisted men of the\r\nnavy.\r\n\r\nThe _bureau of yards and docks_ attends to the navy yards, docks,\r\nwharves, their buildings and machinery.\r\n\r\nThe _bureau of ordnance_ superintends the forging and testing of\r\ncannon, guns, and other military equipments, and the construction of\r\nnaval torpedoes.\r\n\r\nThe _bureau of medicine and surgery_ has charge of the naval\r\nlaboratory, the eight naval hospitals, and the purchase and\r\ndistribution of surgical instruments and medical stores for the naval\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\nThe _bureau of supplies and accounts_ purchases and distributes\r\nprovisions and clothing for the navy.\r\n\r\nThe _bureau of steam engineering_ superintends the construction and\r\nrepair of engines and machinery for the vessels of war.\r\n\r\nThe _bureau of construction and repair_ has charge of all matters\r\nrelating to the construction and repair of all vessels and boats used\r\nin the naval service.\r\n\r\nNAVAL ACADEMY.--The naval academy at Annapolis is maintained by the\r\nnational government for the purpose of educating and training officers\r\nfor the navy.  It bears the same relation to the navy that the military\r\nacademy bears to the army.  At the academy there are three midshipmen\r\nfor each member of Congress; the President appoints two from the\r\nDistrict of Columbia and ten a year from the United States at large;\r\nand fifteen enlisted men of the navy are appointed each year on\r\ncompetitive examination.  The academy is under the charge of a\r\nsuperintendent, appointed by the secretary of the navy.  Each\r\nmidshipman receives from the government an annual sum of money\r\nsufficient to pay all necessary expenses incurred at the academy.\r\n\r\nPOST-OFFICE DEPARTMENT.--The postmaster-general presides over the\r\npost-office department.  He has control of all questions relating to\r\nthe management of post-offices and the carrying of the mails, and\r\nappoints all postmasters whose annual salaries are less than a thousand\r\ndollars each.  Postmasters whose salaries exceed this sum are appointed\r\nby the President of the United States.\r\n\r\nBUREAUS.--The postmaster-general has four assistants, who, under him,\r\nare in charge of the various details of the vast establishment devoted\r\nto the postal service.\r\n\r\nThe _first assistant postmaster-general_ has general charge of\r\npost-offices and postmasters, and makes preparations for the\r\nappointment of all postmasters.  He also controls the free delivery of\r\nmail matter in cities, and the dead letter office.\r\n\r\nThe _second assistant postmaster-general_ attends to the letting of\r\ncontracts for carrying the mails, decides upon the mode of conveyance,\r\nand fixes the time for the arrival and departure of mails at each\r\npost-office.  He also has charge of the foreign mail service.  The\r\nUnited States has postal treaties with all the other civilized\r\ncountries in the world, by which regular mail lines are maintained.\r\n\r\nThe _third assistant postmaster-general_ has charge of financial\r\nmatters.  He provides stamps, stamped envelopes, and postal cards for\r\npost-offices, and receives the reports and settlements of postmasters.\r\nHe also superintends the registered mail service, the postal savings\r\nsystem, and the post-office money-order business.  By means of money\r\norders people may deposit money in the post-office at which they mail\r\ntheir letters, and have it paid at the office to which their letters\r\nare addressed.\r\n\r\nThe _fourth assistant postmaster-general_ has charge of the rural free\r\ndelivery system,--a very important service.  He also furnishes blanks\r\nand stationery to post-offices throughout the United States, and\r\nsupervises the making of the various post-route maps, such as those\r\nused for rural delivery and for the parcel post.\r\n\r\nINTERIOR DEPARTMENT.--The secretary of the interior is the chief\r\nofficer of the interior department.  The former name, _home\r\ndepartment_, suggests the character of the subjects under its control.\r\nIts duties relate to various public interests which have been\r\ntransferred to it from other departments.  The department of the\r\ninterior has charge of pensions, public lands, Indian affairs, patents,\r\neducation, and the geological survey.\r\n\r\nThe _commissioner of pensions_ has charge of the examination of pension\r\nclaims and the granting of pensions and bounties for service in the\r\narmy and the navy.  There are about a million names on the pension\r\nrolls of the United States, and the annual payment of pensions amounts\r\nto about one hundred and forty million dollars.\r\n\r\nThe _commissioner of the general land office_ superintends the surveys\r\nand sales of the lands belonging to the national government.  The\r\nUnited States surveys divide the public lands into ranges, townships,\r\nsections, and fractions of sections.  Ranges are bounded by north and\r\nsouth lines, six miles apart, and are numbered east and west.  Ranges\r\nare divided into townships, each six miles square, numbered north and\r\nsouth.  A township is divided into thirty-six sections, each one mile\r\nsquare, and containing six hundred and forty acres of land; and\r\nsections are divided into quarter sections.\r\n\r\nThe _commissioner of Indian affairs_ has charge of questions relating\r\nto the government of the Indians.  Its agents make treaties, manage\r\nlands, issue rations and clothing, and conduct trade with the Indians.\r\n\r\nThe _commissioner of patents_ conducts all matters pertaining to the\r\ngranting of patents for useful inventions, discoveries, and\r\nimprovements.\r\n\r\nA _patent_ gives the inventor the exclusive right to manufacture, sell,\r\nand use the patented article for a period of seventeen years.\r\n\r\nA _copyright_, which is somewhat similar to a patent, gives the author\r\nof a book the exclusive right to print, publish, and sell it for a\r\nperiod of twenty-eight years, with the privilege at the expiration of\r\nthat time of renewing for twenty-eight years more.\r\n\r\nAn inventor or author may sell a patent or copyright, as well as other\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nThe _commissioner of education_ investigates the condition and progress\r\nof education in the several States and Territories, and collects\r\ninformation relating to schools, school systems, and methods of\r\nteaching.  The facts collected are distributed among the people in\r\nannual reports published by the office.\r\n\r\nThe _director of the geological survey_ sends out parties of scientific\r\nmen, who explore various parts of the Union, trace the sources of\r\nrivers, measure the heights of lands, and gather other facts relating\r\nto the natural resources of the country.  He publishes excellent maps\r\nof the regions that have been explored.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.--The attorney-general presides over the\r\ndepartment of justice.  He is the chief law officer of the government,\r\nand the legal adviser of all the departments.  He is assisted by the\r\nsolicitor-general, who is the second officer in rank; by nine assistant\r\nattorney-generals, and by several solicitors for particular\r\ndepartments.  The department of justice conducts before the supreme\r\ncourt all suits to which the United States is a party; conducts suits\r\narising in any of the departments, when requested by the head thereof;\r\nexercises supervision over the district attorneys and marshals of the\r\nUnited States district courts; examines the titles of lands proposed to\r\nbe purchased by the United States, as sites for forts, arsenals,\r\nbarracks, dockyards, customhouses, post-offices, and other public\r\npurposes; examines and reports upon applications for judicial offices\r\nand other positions requiring legal ability.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE.--The department of agriculture was\r\nreorganized in 1889.  Previous to that time it had been a bureau of the\r\ninterior department.  The secretary of agriculture is the chief officer\r\nof the department of agriculture.\r\n\r\nThis department collects and diffuses among the people useful knowledge\r\nrelating to agriculture and agricultural products.  Experiments are\r\nconducted upon farm and garden products, and the seeds of choice\r\nvarieties are distributed among the people.  Similar attention is given\r\nto stock-raising and the care of forests.  The _bureau of chemistry_\r\nassists in the enforcement of the pure food law.\r\n\r\nThe department also includes the _weather bureau_, which collects and\r\npublishes telegraphic reports of storms and the condition of the\r\nweather, in the interest of agriculture and commerce.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE.--The department of commerce and labor was\r\ncreated in 1903, and ten years later was divided into two departments.\r\nThe secretary of commerce presides over the department of commerce.\r\nIts duty is to promote and develop commerce, mining, manufacturing, and\r\nfisheries.  It collects and publishes facts and figures on all these\r\nsubjects; supplies exactly true weights and measures for any one to\r\ncopy; controls stations for stocking waters with valuable fish;\r\ninspects and licenses steamships, rejecting any that are unseaworthy;\r\nsurveys the seacoast of the United States, and maintains lighthouses at\r\ndangerous points.\r\n\r\nThe work of the department is divided among a number of bureaus, many\r\nof which were already in existence when the new department was formed.\r\nAmong these is the _census office_, which takes a census of the United\r\nStates every ten years, besides collecting other statistics at shorter\r\nintervals.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF LABOR.--The secretary of labor presides over the\r\ndepartment of labor.  Its duty is to promote the welfare of wage\r\nearners.  It makes important investigations, and publishes statistics\r\nconcerning laborers.  This department includes the _children's bureau_,\r\nwhich studies problems, affecting children's welfare.  It also includes\r\nthe _bureau of immigration_ and the _bureau of naturalisation_, which\r\nsupervise the enforcement of United States laws regarding immigration\r\nand naturalization.\r\n\r\nSEPARATE COMMISSIONS.--In addition to the civil service commission,\r\nCongress has created two other important commissions not connected with\r\nany department.  The _interstate commerce commission_, consisting of\r\nseven members appointed by the President, supervises interstate\r\nrailroads, express companies, etc., and enforces the laws which control\r\nthem.  The _federal trade commission_, consisting of five members\r\nappointed by the President, supervises the business of persons and\r\ncompanies engaged in interstate commerce, except those under the\r\ncontrol of the interstate commerce commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n1. Why does the Constitution require that the President shall be a\r\nnative of the United States?\r\n\r\n2. Who is now President, and of what State is he a citizen?\r\n\r\n3. When was he elected?\r\n\r\n4. Should the President be eligible for reelection?\r\n\r\n5. Do you think he should have the veto power?\r\n\r\n6. Of what use is a passport in traveling?\r\n\r\n7. What is internal revenue?\r\n\r\n8. What was the principal cause of the national debt?\r\n\r\n9. How many soldiers, including officers, in the army of the United\r\nStates?\r\n\r\n10. Of what value are the weather reports?\r\n\r\n11. Why is it right for the government to grant pensions?\r\n\r\n12. Why should a census be taken?\r\n\r\n13. What is the population of the United States, and what the\r\npopulation of this State, by the last census?\r\n\r\n14. What is meant by conducting a suit before the supreme court?\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTION FOR DEBATE.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the President and the Vice President should be elected\r\nby the popular vote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE UNITED STATES--(Continued).\r\n\r\nJUDICIAL DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\nThe judicial department is one of the three great departments of the\r\ngovernment, being coordinate with Congress, the legislative power, and\r\nwith the President, the executive power.  The principle of three\r\ncoordinate departments of government is new, the United States being\r\nthe first nation that ever embodied it in its constitution.\r\n\r\nThe judicial system of the United States includes the Supreme Court of\r\nthe United States, the circuit courts of appeals, district courts, the\r\ncourts of the District of Columbia, the court of claims, the court of\r\ncustoms appeals, a territorial court for each of the Territories, and\r\nseveral commissioners' courts in each of the States.\r\n\r\nJURISDICTION OF UNITED STATES COURTS.--The jurisdiction of United\r\nStates courts extends to the following classes of suits at law:\r\n\r\n1. To all cases arising under laws passed by Congress.\r\n\r\n2. Those affecting ministers, consuls, and other agents of the United\r\nStates and foreign countries.\r\n\r\n3. Suits arising on the high seas.\r\n\r\n4. All suits to which the United States is a party.\r\n\r\n5. Controversies between a State and the citizens of another State.\r\n\r\n6. Cases between citizens of different States.\r\n\r\n7. Suits between citizens of the same State claiming lands under grants\r\nby different States.\r\n\r\n8. Cases between a State or its citizens and a foreign State or its\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that all cases at law to which a State is a party must\r\nbe tried in the courts of the United States.  A direct suit can not be\r\nbrought against the United States except by authority of a special act\r\nof Congress; nor can a suit be brought against a State by a citizen of\r\nanother State, or by one of its own citizens, except by the special\r\npermission of its legislature.\r\n\r\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES.--The Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates is the highest judicial tribunal in the country.  It consists of\r\nthe Chief Justice and eight associate justices, nominated by the\r\nPresident and confirmed by the Senate.  The country is divided into\r\nnine circuits, each represented by a Justice of the Supreme Court.  The\r\njustices hold their offices during life, unless impeached; but they\r\nhave the privilege of retiring upon full pay, at seventy years of age,\r\nprovided they have served in the court for ten years.  A quorum\r\nconsists of any six justices, and if a majority agree upon a decision\r\nit becomes the decision of the court.\r\n\r\nThe court holds annual sessions in the Capitol building at Washington,\r\nbeginning upon the second Monday in October.  The annual salary of the\r\nChief Justice is fifteen thousand dollars; that of the associate\r\njustices is fourteen thousand five hundred dollars each.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of the United States creates and names the Supreme\r\nCourt, and provides that the Judicial power shall be vested in it \"and\r\nin such inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain\r\nand establish.\"\r\n\r\nJURISDICTION.--The Supreme Court has original jurisdiction in all cases\r\naffecting ministers, consuls, and other agents of the United States and\r\nforeign countries, and in cases to which a State is a party.\r\n\r\nMost cases tried by it are brought before it upon appeals from the\r\ninferior courts of the United States.  They involve chiefly the\r\nquestions of jurisdiction of the inferior courts, the constitutionality\r\nof laws, the validity of treaties, and the sentences in criminal and\r\nprize causes.  An appeal from a State court can be carried to the\r\nSupreme Court only upon the ground that the decision of the State court\r\nis in conflict with the Constitution or laws of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar province of the Supreme Court is to interpret the\r\nConstitution, and in all conflicts between a State and the nation the\r\nfinal decision rests with the Supreme Court of the United States.  It\r\nmay, and does, modify its own judgments; but until it modifies or\r\nreverses a decision, it is final, and from it there is no appeal.\r\nWhether its decree be against a private citizen, a State, the Congress,\r\nor the President, that decree is \"the end of the whole matter,\" and\r\nmust be obeyed.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court is more admired and praised by foreign critics than\r\nis any other of our institutions.  It is conceded by all to be one of\r\nthe strongest and best features in our system of government.  In a free\r\ncountry like ours, such a tribunal is necessary to prevent the\r\nlegislative and executive departments from trespassing upon the\r\nConstitution, and invading the rights of the people.  Therefore the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States has been appropriately called \"the\r\nbalance-wheel in our system of government.\"\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES CIRCUIT COURTS OF APPEALS.--Each United States circuit\r\nembraces several States, and has two or more circuit judges.  One\r\njustice of the Supreme Court is also assigned to each circuit.  There\r\nare nine circuit courts of appeals, one for each United States circuit.\r\nAll appeals from the district courts must be made to the circuit courts\r\nof appeals, except in cases expressly provided by law to be taken\r\ndirect to the Supreme Court; but provision is also made for appeal from\r\nthe decision of the circuit courts of appeals to the Supreme Court in\r\ncertain classes of cases.\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT.--Each State has one or more United States\r\ndistrict courts, each presided over by a district judge.  The district\r\ncourt has both civil and criminal jurisdiction in all cases under the\r\nnational law which are not required to be brought in other courts.\r\nBefore 1912 there were so-called \"circuit courts\" usually held by the\r\ndistrict judges, for the trial of certain important kinds of cases; but\r\nthese were abolished by an act of 1911.\r\n\r\nIn each State a large majority of the civil and criminal cases must be\r\ntried and finally decided in the State courts.  However, among the\r\nimportant cases tried in United States courts are those concerning\r\npatents, copyrights, and bankruptcy, those involved in the regulation\r\nof interstate and foreign commerce, and offenses committed against the\r\npostal and revenue laws.\r\n\r\nInterstate commerce cases are often in the form of appeals from the\r\norders issued by the interstate commerce commission, fixing the freight\r\nand passenger rates of railroads, etc.  Such a case is heard by three\r\njudges sitting together, and an appeal from their decision can be taken\r\ndirectly to the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nIf the circuit and district judges desire, they may retire upon full\r\npay at the age of seventy, after ten years of consecutive service.\r\n\r\nCOURT OF CUSTOMS APPEALS.--The customs court consists of a chief judge\r\nand four associate judges.  It decides disputes over the rates of duty\r\npayable on imported goods.  It holds sessions both at Washington and in\r\nother cities.\r\n\r\nCOURT OF CLAIMS.--The court of claims holds its sessions at Washington,\r\nand consists of a chief justice and four associate justices.  It hears\r\nand determines claims against the United States.  No one could bring\r\nsuit against the national government without permission from Congress;\r\nbut a person having a claim against it may submit the claim to the\r\ncourt of claims for trial, and, if the claim is declared to be legal\r\nand just, it is almost always paid by act of Congress.\r\n\r\nOTHER COURTS.--The _District of Columbia_ has six supreme court\r\njustices and three justices of a court of appeals.  Their jurisdiction\r\nis similar to that of the United States district courts and circuit\r\ncourts of appeals, but is confined to the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\n_Territorial courts_ consist of a chief justice and two associate\r\njustices, who hold their offices for a term of four years, unless\r\nremoved by the President.  A territorial court holds its sessions in\r\nthe Territory for which it is constituted, and has jurisdiction of\r\ncases arising under the laws of Congress and the laws passed by the\r\nterritorial legislature.\r\n\r\nAppeals are taken from the courts of the District of Columbia and from\r\nthe territorial courts to the supreme court of the United States.\r\n\r\nA United States commissioner's court consists of a commissioner\r\nappointed by the judge of the district court.  The chief duties of this\r\ncourt are to arrest and hold for trial persons charged with offenses\r\nagainst the United States, and to assist in taking testimony for the\r\ntrial of cases.  A judge of a State court or a justice of the peace may\r\nact as United States commissioner, but while engaged in such duties he\r\nis an officer of the United States, and not of the State.\r\n\r\nTERM OF SERVICE.--Justices of circuit courts, district courts, the\r\ncustoms court, the court of claims, the courts of the District of\r\nColumbia, and of the territorial courts, are appointed by the President\r\nand confirmed by the Senate.  The justices of these courts, except of\r\nthe territorial courts, hold their offices during life, unless\r\nimpeached.  This life tenure of office, and the provision that a salary\r\nof a justice shall not be reduced during his term, render the courts of\r\nthe United States independent of Congress and public opinion, and tend\r\nto preserve the purity and dignity of their decisions.\r\n\r\nThe salary of a judge of the circuit court is seven thousand dollars;\r\nthat of a judge of a district court is six thousand dollars; that of a\r\njudge of the customs court is seven thousand dollars; and that of a\r\njustice of the court of claims is six thousand dollars, except the\r\nchief justice, who receives six thousand five hundred dollars.\r\n\r\nOFFICERS OF COURTS.--The United States district courts have grand\r\njuries and trial juries, who perform duties similar to those of juries\r\nin State courts.  With the consent of the Senate, the President\r\nappoints for each district a United States district attorney and a\r\nUnited States marshal.\r\n\r\nThe _district attorney_ represents the United States in all civil cases\r\nto which it is a party, and is the prosecuting officer in criminal\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nThe _marshal_ is the executive and ministerial officer of the court,\r\nwith duties similar to those of a sheriff.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of the United States appoints a _reporter_, who\r\nreports--that is, edits and publishes--its decisions.  This court also\r\nappoints its own _marshal_.  The decisions of the district court are\r\nreported by the Judge, or by an attorney under the judge's sanction.\r\nEach court appoints a clerk, who keeps a record of its proceedings;\r\ngives a history of each case; notes all orders, decisions, and\r\njudgments; has charge of all money paid; and keeps and fixes the seal\r\nof the court.\r\n\r\nThe circuit courts of appeals appoint their own marshals and clerks.\r\nThe duties of these officers are similar to those performed by the\r\nmarshal and clerk of the Supreme Court.  The circuit courts of appeals\r\nhave no reporters.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n1. Who is chief justice of the United States, and of what State is he a\r\ncitizen?\r\n\r\n2. Why should a judge hold his position during a long term of years?\r\n\r\n3. This State is a part of what United States circuit?\r\n\r\n4. What justice represents this circuit in the supreme court?\r\n\r\n5. Who is judge of the United States district court of this district?\r\n\r\n6. Why can no person bring suit against the United States except by\r\nspecial act of Congress?\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTION FOR DEBATE.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the jury system should be abolished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\nGovernment is defined as _rule_ or _control_.  It is that which\r\ngoverns, and also the act of governing.  In its political sense, it\r\nmeans the supreme authority of a State or other political community, or\r\nthe act by which this authority is applied.  It is sometimes said to be\r\na system of institutions for the restraint of people living in the\r\nsocial state or social condition.\r\n\r\nThe word _govern_ is derived from a Latin word which first meant _to\r\nsteer the ship_, and then very naturally came to mean _to guide, to\r\ndirect, to command_.\r\n\r\n\"The comparison of governing with steering is a very happy one,\" for\r\nthe interest of him who steers is the same as that of the people in the\r\nship: \"all must float or sink together.\"  So the interest of those that\r\ngovern, of those that guide \"the ship of state,\" as we often express\r\nit, is the same as that of the people.[1]\r\n\r\nORIGIN AND NECESSITY.--The origin of government is unknown; its\r\nbeginning can not be traced.  People everywhere, in all the varying\r\ndegrees of civilization, recognize the necessity of a supreme\r\nauthority, to whom all owe and render obedience.\r\n\r\nMen can not long live in the same vicinity without some kind of\r\npolitical organization.  Without some sort of government--that is, some\r\nsupreme power to settle disputes--the people would be in continual\r\nwarfare; there could be no security to person or property; each\r\nindividual could look to himself alone for safety; \"his hand would be\r\nagainst every man, and every man's hand against him.\"\r\n\r\nWherever men are found they live under some form of government, however\r\nrude and imperfect.  In all parts and in all ages of the world they\r\nhave seen the necessity of some power to protect the weak and restrain\r\nthe strong, and have therefore set up a supreme authority for the\r\ncommon welfare.\r\n\r\nA body of people living under government is called _society_, and the\r\nagreement existing between them, for their common welfare, is called\r\nthe _social compact_.\r\n\r\nMen are so constituted that society is necessary to their happiness.\r\nTherefore they seek the social state and join the social compact, thus\r\nagreeing to be governed by law and order.\r\n\r\nFOR THE PEOPLE.--Government is for the people, and not for the rulers.\r\nOfficers, the highest and the lowest, are merely the servants of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nAll governments derive their just powers from the consent of the\r\npeople, and are established and maintained for their good.  All powers\r\nwhich are exercised without the consent of the people are unjust and\r\ntyrannical.\r\n\r\nKINDS.--Government is of two kinds, civil and military.\r\n\r\n_Civil government_ is the government of civil society, or the\r\ngovernment of the people in a peaceful state.\r\n\r\n_Military government_ is the government of men in a state of war.  It\r\nprevails in the army and the navy, and sometimes in districts which are\r\nthe scenes of military operations.\r\n\r\nMilitary government is conducted by the rules of martial law, and in\r\nits penalties and exactions is much more severe than civil government.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORMS OF CIVIL GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\nThere are many forms of civil government, but they may be reduced to\r\nthree principal systems:\r\n\r\n1. _Monarchy_: government by one person.\r\n\r\n2. _Aristocracy_: government by a few persons.\r\n\r\n3. _Democracy_: government by the people.\r\n\r\nEvery government is either one of these forms or is composed of two or\r\nmore of them.\r\n\r\nMONARCHY.--A _monarchy_ is a government whose chief authority is vested\r\nin one person, usually called king, queen, emperor, empress, or prince.\r\nMonarchies are absolute or limited.\r\n\r\nIn an _absolute monarchy_ there is no limit to the power of the\r\nmonarch; his wishes are the laws of the people.  The people are his\r\nproperty, and in his person are combined all the powers of government,\r\nlegislative, executive, and judicial.  Russia is the only civilized\r\nnation whose government is still an absolute monarchy.\r\n\r\nIn a _constitutional monarchy_ the sovereign, or chief ruler, must\r\ngovern by laws made by a representative body elected by the people.\r\nEngland and Germany are constitutional monarchies.\r\n\r\nIn an _hereditary monarchy_ the sovereign inherits the ruling power,\r\nusually from his father.\r\n\r\nIn an _elective monarchy_ the sovereign is elected for life, usually by\r\nthe dignitaries of other nations.\r\n\r\nA _patriarchy_ is a monarchy in which the chief power is exercised by a\r\npatriarch, or father.  The authority of the patriarch is confined to\r\nhis tribe.  This form of government was common in ancient times, before\r\ntribes were combined into nations.\r\n\r\nA _theocracy_ is a monarchy whose rulers claim to be under the direct\r\nguidance of God.  The government of the ancient Hebrews was a theocracy.\r\n\r\nARISTOCRACY.--An _aristocracy_, sometimes called _oligarchy_, is a\r\ngovernment in which the supreme authority is vested in a privileged\r\nfew, distinguished by their wealth and social position.\r\n\r\nThe privileged class are usually called nobles.  They are above the\r\ncommon people in rank and bear titles of honor.  These titles are\r\nmostly inherited, but are sometimes conferred upon persons by the\r\nsovereign.\r\n\r\nAn aristocracy never exists by itself; it is always combined with some\r\nother form of government, usually with a constitutional monarchy.  The\r\ngovernment of England is partly aristocratic; the House of Lords, one\r\nof the bodies of Parliament, being composed of nobles.\r\n\r\nDEMOCRACY.--A _democracy_ is a \"government of the people, by the\r\npeople, for the people.\"  It is a government by many, instead of by one\r\nor by a few.  Hereditary titles are inconsistent with democratic\r\ngovernment, and therefore never exist in a democracy.\r\n\r\nA _pure democracy_ is a government conducted by the people in person.\r\nIt is practicable only in a political community so small that all the\r\npeople may assemble at the seat of government.  The New England \"town\r\nmeeting\" is almost the only example of a pure democracy in the world at\r\nthe present time; certainly the only example in the United States.\r\n\r\nA _republic_, or _representative democracy_, is a government conducted\r\nby representatives elected by the people.\r\n\r\nThe United States, Mexico, France, Switzerland, and all South American\r\nnations are republics, and the republican principle of government is\r\ngrowing in popularity throughout the civilized world.\r\n\r\nNo form of government is equally good for all peoples.  A certain form\r\nmay be good for one country and bad for another country.  A republic,\r\nwhich is the best government for a well-educated and virtuous people,\r\nis the worst for an ignorant and depraved people.\r\n\r\nThe excellence of a republican government depends upon the knowledge\r\nand virtue of its citizens.  The people are the rulers, and, if they\r\nare wise and virtuous, they will rule well; if they are ignorant and\r\ndepraved, they will rule ill.  Therefore the hope of a republic like\r\nours is, that its people will continue to grow wiser and better.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Fiske's _Civil Government of the United States_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n1. Why is military government more severe than civil government?\r\n\r\n2. Could society exist without law?  Why?\r\n\r\n3. Why is a republic a bad form of government for an ignorant people?\r\n\r\n4. Are the people of the United States growing wiser and better?\r\n\r\n5. Is this State improving in civilization?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE.\r\n\r\nThe object of government is to protect the people, and to render\r\njustice to them.  _Justice_ is the security of rights.  A _right_ is a\r\nwell-founded claim; that is, a just claim of one person upon other\r\npersons.\r\n\r\n_Rights_ are the most important things that a person can possess,\r\nbecause his happiness depends upon them.  They are real things, for\r\nwhose protection governments are instituted.  The kind and extent of\r\nthe rights recognized and protected in any country determine the form\r\nof its government.  As a rule, there is more freedom among citizens of\r\na republic than among those of other governments, because a republic\r\nguarantees more rights.\r\n\r\n\r\nRIGHTS AND DUTIES.\r\n\r\nPeople have many rights, and they have as many duties.  Each right\r\ngiven to a person is a trust placed in his hands for him to discharge.\r\nA right implies a duty, and a duty implies a right.  Rights and duties\r\ngo hand in hand.  For example, children have a right to the protection\r\nof their parents, and this implies that it is the duty of children to\r\nobey their parents.\r\n\r\nCIVIL RIGHTS AND DUTIES.--Rights and duties are civil and political.\r\n_Civil rights_ are sometimes called _inalienable rights_, because they\r\ncan not be justly taken away except as a punishment for crime.  They\r\nare chiefly those rights with which we are endowed by nature.  They are\r\nnot conferred by any earthly power, but are given to every human being\r\nat his birth.  They are called civil rights, because they belong to the\r\ncitizen in his ordinary daily life.  Among civil rights are:\r\n\r\n1. _The right to personal security_; that is, the right to be free from\r\nattack and annoyance;\r\n\r\n2. _The right of personal liberty_; that is, to go when and where he\r\npleases, provided he does not trespass upon the rights of others; and\r\n\r\n3. _The right of private property_; that is, the right to use, enjoy,\r\nand dispose of what he has acquired by labor, purchase, gift, or\r\ninheritance.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of these rights belong to men whether living in\r\nsociety, that is, under government, or living without government.\r\nTheir natural rights are more extensive without society than with it,\r\nbut are far less secure.  Without government natural rights are\r\nunlimited; each person may lay claim to all land and to all it\r\nproduces, provided he is strong enough to maintain his claim by force.\r\n\r\nWhen men join the social compact, they agree to abandon some of their\r\nnatural rights, in order to be protected by the government in those\r\nwhich they retain; that is, each person agrees that in making his own\r\nclaims he will have due regard for the similar claims of others.\r\n\r\nIn entering the social compact, men also agree to submit their personal\r\nclaims to settlement by the law, instead of going to war to maintain\r\nthem.  They agree to refer their disputes to courts established for\r\nthat purpose.  As a rule, under government, right prevails; without\r\ngovernment, might prevails.\r\n\r\n_Civil rights_ are divided into _industrial rights_, _social rights_,\r\nand _moral_ or _religious rights_.\r\n\r\nINDUSTRIAL RIGHTS AND DUTIES.--It is the right and duty of each person\r\nto provide in his own way, providing it is legal and honest, for\r\nhimself and those dependent upon him.  All business transactions; the\r\nsearch for homes, comforts, and wealth; agriculture, manufacturing,\r\nmining, and commerce; the conduct of all professions, occupations, and\r\nindustries; the interests of farm laborers, operatives in factories,\r\nminers, clerks, and all persons engaged in mental or physical labor,\r\nare based upon industrial rights and duties.\r\n\r\nThe wages of people, the hours of labor, railway and telegraph lines,\r\ncanals, express companies, other common carriers, the various kinds of\r\nemployment, and the organization of men in different branches of\r\nindustry to advance their interests, are questions affecting industrial\r\nrights.  These rights underlie all efforts of people to improve their\r\nfinancial condition.\r\n\r\nSOCIAL RIGHTS AND DUTIES.--Each member of society has rights as such,\r\nand these are called _social rights_.  They include the rights of\r\npersonal security and protection.  They underlie all efforts for the\r\nimprovement of the social condition of the people.  Society is\r\ninterested in better schools, in public health, in the reformation of\r\ncriminals, in good highways and streets, in safe buildings, in\r\nwell-lighted cities and villages, in the maintenance of charitable\r\ninstitutions, in the establishment of sources of harmless amusement,\r\nand in the preservation of peace and order.\r\n\r\nThe comfort and convenience of the public are even more important than\r\nthe comfort and convenience of any person.  Therefore, individual\r\nrights must yield to public rights when the two conflict.  For example,\r\nthe land of a private citizen may be condemned by the proper\r\nauthorities, and be used for public highways or other public purposes.\r\nThe government pays the owner of the property condemned, but usually\r\nless than his estimate of the value.\r\n\r\nThis right of society, existing above the right, of any of its members,\r\nis called the RIGHT OF EMINENT DOMAIN.  By it individual rights must\r\nyield to the rights of society, of the government, or of a corporation.\r\nA corporation is an association of individuals authorized by law to\r\ntransact business as a single natural person.  Railway companies,\r\nbanks, chartered cities and villages, and the counties of some States\r\nare corporations.\r\n\r\nMORAL RIGHTS AND DUTIES.--Man is a moral being; that is, he is\r\nconscious of good and evil.  Therefore he has moral rights and duties.\r\n\r\nHe has rights of conscience, with which it is not the province of\r\ngovernment to interfere.  He naturally worships a Being superior to\r\nhimself, and feels the obligation to deal justly with his fellow-men.\r\nHe has a right to do and say all things which are not unlawful or wrong\r\nwithin themselves.  It is his right to worship when he pleases, whom he\r\npleases, and as he pleases.\r\n\r\nThe moral rights and duties of the people are concerned in the\r\nmaintenance of religion, the support of churches, in reverence for\r\nthings sacred, in acts of charity and benevolence, in living an upright\r\nlife, and in teaching lessons of morality, honesty, industry, and\r\nusefulness.  Whatever is implied in the word _ought_, correctly used,\r\nis a moral duty.\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL RIGHTS AND DUTIES.--By the social compact, men also agree to\r\nabandon a part of their natural rights in order to participate in the\r\ngovernment.  They agree in part to be governed by others, in order that\r\nin part they may govern others.  The rights of participation in the\r\ngovernment, such as voting and holding office, are called political\r\nrights, because they affect the public policy of society.\r\n\r\nPolitical rights do not belong to men by nature, but are conferred by\r\ngovernment.  Within reasonable bounds, they may be enlarged or\r\nrestricted without injustice.  Since they are conferred by the\r\ngovernment, the power to vote and to hold office is a privilege to be\r\nenjoyed rather than a right to be asserted.\r\n\r\nIn the United States the political rights of the people are carefully\r\nset forth in the Constitution.  The smallest functions of government,\r\nsuch as the size and color of a postage stamp, or the employment of a\r\npage in the State legislature, touch the political rights of the\r\ncitizen.  Appointment and elections to public office, the enactment of\r\nlaws, and the performance of public duties are questions of political\r\nconcern.\r\n\r\nGood laws, good administrations, and the perpetuity of the government\r\nitself, depend upon the manner in which the people discharge their\r\npublic duties.  A man who habitually fails to vote and to take interest\r\nin the political affairs of his country may be a good man, but he is\r\ncertainly a bad citizen.\r\n\r\nTo be a good citizen is to aid intelligently in giving the people good\r\ngovernment.  For a man to hold himself aloof from politics, unless his\r\naction is based upon conscientious scruples, shows his interest in\r\nhimself, and his lack of interest in his country.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n1. Why does happiness depend upon the maintenance of rights?\r\n\r\n2. How do persons _born_ under government agree to be governed by the\r\nlaws?\r\n\r\n3. If the claims of people as to their rights conflict, how is the\r\ndifference settled?\r\n\r\n4. What is meant by the phrase \"common carrier\"?\r\n\r\n5. Is it right for men to hold aloof from public affairs because there\r\nis corruption in politics?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nLAW AND LIBERTY.\r\n\r\nThrough law rights are secured, and the performance of some duties is\r\nenforced.  _Law_ is a rule of action, prescribing what shall be done\r\nand what shall not be done.  Laws exist for the purpose of securing the\r\nrights of the people.  The enjoyment of rights is _liberty_.\r\n\r\nAs the enjoyment of rights depends upon their security, and as they are\r\nsecured by law, therefore liberty is based upon law.  Without law there\r\ncould be no political liberty, and the civil liberty of the people\r\nwould be narrow and uncertain.  It may be said, therefore, that there\r\ncan be no true liberty without law; but laws may be so many and so\r\nstringent that there can be no liberty.  Liberty and _just_ laws are\r\ninseparable.\r\n\r\nLiberty and rights are of the same kinds, _industrial_, _social_,\r\n_moral_ or _religious_, and _political_.  The words \"rights,\" \"law,\"\r\nand \"liberty\" are full of meaning, and in a free country suggest ideas\r\nof the deepest reverence.\r\n\r\nORIGIN.--The laws of the country are partly human and partly divine.\r\nThey were framed by man, but some of them are based upon the laws of\r\nGod.  Some are of recent origin, and many are so ancient that their\r\nbeginning can not be traced.  When men began, to live in society, they\r\nbegan to make laws, for laws at once became necessary.  Laws are\r\nundergoing constant changes, as new conditions arise and new customs\r\nprevail.\r\n\r\n\r\nKINDS OF LAW.\r\n\r\nThe _moral law_ prescribes our duties to men, and also to God.  It is\r\nsummed up and revealed in the Ten Commandments, and is the same as the\r\nlaw of nature taught us by our consciences.\r\n\r\nThe _common law_ consists of the principles and rules of action applied\r\nby the courts in cases not regulated by express legislative acts.  It\r\nis the unwritten law which has been practiced for ages in England and\r\nthe United States.  In all States of the Union, except Louisiana, cases\r\nnot covered by the acts of the legislature are tried by the common law.\r\n\r\nThe _civil law_ is the law that prevailed among the ancient Romans.  It\r\nis still in use among most of the nations of continental Europe.  In\r\nLouisiana it is applied to cases not covered by the laws of the\r\nlegislature.  The words _civil law_ are sometimes used to denote the\r\nlaw governing civil suits.\r\n\r\n_Statute law_ consists of the acts passed by legislative assemblies.\r\nThe words are used to denote the opposite of common law.  The enactment\r\nof a statute by a State legislature repeals the common law previously\r\nin force upon the same subject.\r\n\r\n_International law_, often called the _law of nations_, consists of the\r\nrules and customs prevailing between civilized nations in their\r\nrelations with one another.  It is based upon the law of nature, the\r\nlaw of right and wrong.\r\n\r\n_Criminal law_ is the law governing criminal cases.  It is partly\r\ncommon law and partly statute law.  \"Ignorance of the law excuses no\r\none.\"\r\n\r\n_Parliamentary law_ consists of the rules and customs governing\r\nparliamentary assemblies.  It prevails in all law-making bodies, in\r\nconventions and deliberative meetings.\r\n\r\n_Martial law_ is the law which regulates men in military service.  It\r\nprevails in the army and the navy.  The courts which apply it are\r\ncalled _courts martial_.  Martial law is noted for its severity.\r\n\r\n_Maritime law_, or _marine law_, is the law especially relating to the\r\nbusiness of the sea, to ships, their crews, and navigation.  The courts\r\nof maritime law are _admiralty courts_.\r\n\r\n_Commercial law_ is a system of rules for the regulation of trade and\r\ncommerce.  It is deduced from the customs of merchants.\r\n\r\nCOURTS.--Laws are administered, that is, explained and applied, by\r\nmeans of courts.  A _court_ is a body organized for the public\r\nadministration of justice.  A court may consist of a single judge or\r\njustice, or of a number of judges acting together.\r\n\r\nA court can administer the laws only in cases which are brought before\r\nit.  The highest court in the land can not make an order or render a\r\njudgment until the question comes to trial in a regular way.\r\n\r\nSUITS.--_Suits at law_ are called _causes_, _cases_, or _actions_.\r\n\r\nA _civil cause_ is a suit between persons, brought to recover rights or\r\nto secure compensation for their infraction.\r\n\r\nA _criminal cause_ is a charge brought by a State or by the United\r\nStates against a person for the commission of a crime.\r\n\r\nThe _plaintiff_ is the person who brings the suit.  The _defendant_ is\r\nthe person against whom the suit is brought.\r\n\r\nIn all criminal cases in State courts, the State is the plaintiff; in\r\nother words, society prosecutes the offender in the name of the State.\r\nIn criminal cases in the United States courts, the United States is the\r\nplaintiff.\r\n\r\nJUDGES.--The judge represents the majesty of the law, and is often\r\ncalled the court.  He maintains the dignity of the trial, determines\r\nthe method of procedure, interprets the law, instructs the juries,\r\nrenders judgment, and in criminal cases passes sentence upon the\r\noffender.  Judges are presumed to be learned in the law, and to be\r\nperfectly just and impartial in their rulings.\r\n\r\nJURIES.--Most of the courts of this country have two juries, called\r\nrespectively, _grand jury_ and _trial jury_ (or _petit jury_).\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the grand jury is to investigate crime, and to present\r\ncharges, called indictments, for trial by the court.  The number of\r\ngrand jurors to the court varies in different States, being not more\r\nthan twenty-four and not less than twelve.  The grand jury has a\r\nforeman, elected by it, or appointed by the judge of the court.\r\n\r\nThe grand jury inquires into violations of the law, and if, in the\r\njudgment of twelve jurors, the evidence in a particular case warrants a\r\ntrial, a formal written charge is prepared, and the foreman indorses\r\nthereon, \"_A true bill_.\"  Upon this indictment the offender is tried\r\nby the court.\r\n\r\nIn a few States grand juries are rarely if ever called, the indictment\r\nbeing found \"on information\" or on evidence presented to a court\r\ncommissioner.\r\n\r\nA trial jury usually consists of twelve men, but in some States a\r\nsmaller number may be accepted by the judge of the court, in certain\r\ncases, by the agreement of the counsel upon the opposing sides.  The\r\ntrial jury hears the testimony and argument, and then decides upon the\r\ntruth of the facts in dispute, and renders a verdict or decision in the\r\nsuit, and in criminal cases convicts or acquits.\r\n\r\nIn some States all the jurors must agree, or there is no verdict.  In\r\nother States the jury may render a verdict by the agreement of less\r\nthan the whole number of jurors.  Under certain regulations a party to\r\na suit may _challenge_, that is, reject, a part or all of the jurors,\r\nand have others selected in their stead.\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF JURIES.--Grand juries and trial juries are of great\r\nantiquity.  It is thought that they existed among the Saxons in the\r\nnorth of Europe before they invaded and settled England, more than\r\nfourteen hundred years ago.  The jury system and many other political\r\ninstitutions of the United States are derived from England.\r\n\r\nBoth the grand jury and the trial jury are firmly grounded in this\r\ncountry, being recognized, in the constitutions of nearly all the\r\nStates and the Constitution of the United States, and are regarded as\r\namong the strongest supports of a free government.\r\n\r\nOFFICERS OF COURTS.--Each court has one or more ministerial officers,\r\nvariously designated as _constable_, _sheriff_, _tipstaff_, or\r\n_marshal_.  Each court also has one or more clerks, and sometimes other\r\nofficers.  _Attorneys_ are considered officers of the courts in which\r\nthey practice.  They usually represent the plaintiff and the defendant\r\nin court and are then called _counsel_.\r\n\r\nLEGAL PROCEEDINGS in civil cases begin by the court issuing a writ, at\r\nthe instance of plaintiff, summoning defendant to appear.  The\r\ndefendant responding, pleadings are filed--the claims of plaintiff, and\r\nanswer or demurrer of defendant.  If these disagree as to facts, the\r\ncourt subpoenas witnesses.  In the presence of judge and jury, the\r\nplaintiff states his case and the defendant his defense, witnesses are\r\nexamined and cross-examined, and the case is argued.  The judge then\r\ncharges the jury--summarizing the evidence and indicating points to be\r\ndecided; the jury retire to prepare their verdict, which is announced\r\nand recorded as the judgment of the court.\r\n\r\nIn criminal cases the accused may be arrested on a grand jury\r\nindictment or a magistrate's warrant.  Unless the crime is murder, the\r\naccused may be released upon bail until trial, which proceeds as in\r\ncivil cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n1. Why does the State prosecute offenses, instead of leaving this duty\r\nto private persons?\r\n\r\n2. What is meant by passing sentence upon an offender?\r\n\r\n3. Do you believe in the jury system, or in the trial by several judges\r\nsitting together?  Why?\r\n\r\n4. Have you ever seen a court in session?\r\n\r\n5. In this State a grand jury has how many members?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE AND ELECTIONS.\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE.--The most important political right is the right of suffrage;\r\nthat is, the right to vote.  As the government exists for the benefit\r\nof the governed, the purpose of suffrage is to place it under their\r\ncontrol.  It gives each qualified voter a voice in public affairs, and\r\nplaces the country under the rule of the people.\r\n\r\nAs the interests of the voters and their families are the same, and as\r\nthe voters represent these interests, the whole people, including women\r\nand children, have an influence in the government.  The whole machinery\r\nof the State and of the United States is in the hands of those who do\r\nthe voting.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANCE.--The importance of this right can scarcely be\r\noverestimated.  It constitutes the difference between a free country\r\nand a despotism.  There can be no freedom unless the right to vote\r\nresides in the people; nor can there be good government unless this\r\nright is exercised with an intelligent regard for the public welfare.\r\nYet vast numbers of voters never realize the power they wield or the\r\ngreat responsibility it entails upon them.\r\n\r\nELECTIONS.--The right of suffrage is exercised by means of elections.\r\nAn election is the direct method of ascertaining the will of the people\r\nupon public affairs.  They are held for the purpose of giving the\r\npeople opportunity to express their choice in the selection of\r\nofficers, and thus to make known their will upon questions of public\r\nconcern.\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF VOTING.--There are three methods of voting--_viva voce_, by\r\nballot, and by machine.  A man votes _viva voce_ by announcing to the\r\nelection officers the name of the candidate of his choice, and having\r\nit recorded upon the polling-list.  A man votes by _ballot_ by handing\r\nto the officers a slip of paper containing the name of the candidate\r\nvoted for.  The officers deposit the ballots in a box called the\r\n_ballot-box_.  A voting machine has a knob or lever for each candidate,\r\nand is so arranged that the voter can record one vote.\r\n\r\nThe _viva voce_ method was once considered the best; but voting by\r\nballot or by machine has supplanted it generally in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Australian system provides at each polling-place a private\r\napartment, called a booth, where each voter in private prepares his\r\nballot from a printed list of all the candidates, and then hands it to\r\nthe officers, who deposit it in the ballot-box.[1]\r\n\r\nOFFICERS OF ELECTIONS.--The officers of elections at each polling-place\r\nare usually two or more supervisors, inspectors, or judges; a clerk;\r\nand a sheriff, marshal, or other officer of the peace.\r\n\r\nThe _supervisors_ or inspectors decide who are entitled to vote under\r\nthe law, and in elections by ballot they deposit the ballots in the\r\nballot-box.\r\n\r\nThe _clerk_ makes a list of the names of voters, and when the election\r\nis _viva voce_ he records the votes.\r\n\r\nThe _sheriff_ or other peace officer preserves order at the polls, has\r\ncharge of the ballot-box and polling-list after the election closes,\r\nand delivers them to the proper authorities.\r\n\r\nIn most States, at the close of the election the officers _canvass_,\r\nthat is, examine the votes cast, and certify the number of votes\r\nreceived by each candidate.\r\n\r\nIn some States the ballot-box is sealed at the close of the election,\r\nand delivered to the canvassing board of the county.  In such cases the\r\ncanvassing board of the county canvasses the vote, and in State and\r\nnational elections sends returns to the canvassing board of the State\r\nat the State capital.\r\n\r\nIn some States election officers are appointed by the county officers,\r\nusually by the county judge or probate judge; in other States they are\r\nelected by the people.\r\n\r\nBRIBERY.--Bribery in elections is one of the serious evils of politics.\r\n_Bribery_ is offering or receiving a reward for voting.  In most\r\nStates, in addition to other penalties, persons convicted of giving or\r\ntaking bribes are _disfranchised_; that is, are not permitted to vote\r\nthereafter.  In ancient Athens a man convicted of corrupting a voter\r\nsuffered the penalty of death.\r\n\r\nThe selling of a vote is regarded as one of the most infamous crimes\r\nthat men can commit.  Not even the conviction of theft so lowers a man\r\nin public esteem as a conviction of selling his vote, for bribery\r\nsavors of both theft and treason.  To sell his suffrage is to sell his\r\nmanhood, his country, and his convictions.  Most men who sell their\r\nvotes do it through ignorance; they are not aware of the enormity of\r\nthe crime.  He who knows its infamy, and yet barters his suffrage for\r\nmoney, is unworthy of the smallest trust, or even of the recognition of\r\nhonest men.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]For details regarding this system see Chapter XIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n1.

Dutton, member of the legislature of South\r\nAustralia from 1851 to 1865.  At that time the vices frequently\r\naccompanying open elections had begun to flourish in Australia.\r\nBribery, intimidation, disorder, and violence were the order of all\r\nelection days.  The plan was elaborated, and became a law under the\r\nname of the \"Elections Act\" in 1857.\r\n\r\nThe beneficial results of this method soon became evident to other\r\ncountries, and the movement spread to Europe, Canada, and the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nIN THE UNITED STATES.--A similar system to that originally adopted in\r\nAustralia was first introduced into the United States by its adoption\r\nin 1888 in the State of Massachusetts and in the city of Louisville,\r\nKentucky.  The next year the legislatures of Indiana, Montana, Rhode\r\nIsland, Wisconsin, Tennessee, Minnesota, Missouri, Michigan, and\r\nConnecticut passed laws providing for new systems of voting, more or\r\nless resembling the Australian system; and now their example has been\r\nfollowed by almost all the other States.\r\n\r\nPRINCIPLES.--Although there are many modifications of detail in the\r\nstatutes of the various States, there are two essential features of the\r\nballot-reform system which are everywhere observed:\r\n\r\n_First_, An arrangement of polling, by which compulsory secrecy of\r\nvoting is secured, and intimidation or corruption of voters is\r\nprevented.\r\n\r\n_Second_, One or more official ballots, printed and distributed under\r\nauthority, on which the names of all candidates are found.\r\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS.--The following are the requirements of the system:\r\nBallots must be provided by public expense, and none but these ballots\r\nmay be used.  On these ballots should be printed the names of all\r\ncandidates who have been nominated previously to the election, with the\r\nnames of the offices for which they have been nominated and of the\r\nparties they represent.\r\n\r\nThere are two forms of ballots: the _blanket ballot_ and the\r\n_individual ballot_.  The former is arranged in some States so as to\r\ngroup candidates by parties, and in other States by the offices for\r\nwhich they are nominated.  In many cases the names of candidates are\r\nalphabetically arranged, so that there can be no accusation of giving\r\none party or candidate precedence as to position on the ticket.  In a\r\nfew cases, the name of the party to which the candidate belongs does\r\nnot appear on the ballot at all, but only the name of the office for\r\nwhich he has been nominated; but in most cases the name of each party\r\nis printed either at the head of the ticket or opposite the name of\r\neach candidate, or in both places.\r\n\r\nWhere _individual ballots_ are used, a separate ballot is printed for\r\neach party or independent ticket.\r\n\r\nVOTING.--Special sworn clerks are engaged to distribute these ballots\r\nto voters at the polls.\r\n\r\nThe voter is allowed a limited time--say five or ten minutes--to retire\r\ninto an election booth erected for the purpose, to make his choice of\r\ncandidates or ballots.  If the blanket ballot is in use, he does this\r\nby placing a cross opposite the name of the desired candidate or list\r\nof candidates; or by crossing out all others; or by means of pasters\r\nfor the substitution of names.  If individual ballots are provided, he\r\nselects the one he prefers, or corrects it to his liking by pasting\r\nupon it a single name or an entire ticket.  If he prefers, he may write\r\nthe names of candidates of his own nomination in place of those already\r\nprinted.  He, then, without communicating with any one, deposits his\r\nballot as his vote.  Only one man is allowed to enter a booth at a\r\ntime, and none but the ballot clerks and the man about to deposit his\r\nballot are allowed within the enclosure erected for the purpose.\r\n\r\nIn some States the booths are separated one from the other merely by\r\npartitions, as indicated in the cut, page 181; but in other States each\r\nbooth is a separate compartment with a door, which is closed to prevent\r\neven a suspicion of any external observation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (Page 181) Arrangement of polling place as required by\r\nMassachusetts law.]\r\n\r\nIn many States, assistance is rendered to the illiterate or the blind.\r\nIn some cases, in order to aid those who can not read, each party\r\nadopts a device, as an eagle or a flag, which is printed on the ballot.\r\nIn most States a voter who declares that he can not read, or that by\r\nsome physical disability he is unable to mark his ballot, may receive\r\nthe assistance of one or two of the election officers in marking it.\r\n\r\nEvery ballot must be strictly accounted for.  If any person in\r\npreparing a ballot should spoil it, he may obtain others, one at a\r\ntime, not exceeding three in all, provided he returns each spoiled one.\r\nAll ballots thus returned are either immediately burned or else\r\ncancelled and preserved by the clerk.\r\n\r\nADVANTAGES.--The advantages which have already accrued from the\r\nadoption of these laws are manifold:\r\n\r\n_First_, A secret ballot offers an effectual preventive against\r\nbribery, since no man will place his money corruptly without satisfying\r\nhimself that the vote is placed according to agreement.\r\n\r\n_Second_, It secures the voter against the coercion, solicitation, or\r\nintimidation of others, and enables him to vote according to the\r\ndictates of his conscience.\r\n\r\n_Third_, Bargaining and trading at the polls is prevented, and with\r\nthese much tumult, riot, and disorder must of necessity disappear.\r\n\r\n_Fourth_, Money is made less of a factor in politics, and the poor man\r\nis placed on a plane of equality with the rich as a candidate.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these obvious advantages, the ballot reform movement\r\npromises to have much wider effects, and to pave the way and lay the\r\nfoundation for other political reforms.\r\n\r\nFORMS OF BALLOTS.--On pages 185, 186, and 187 are given forms of\r\nballots and other matter illustrating various methods employed in\r\ncarrying out the ballot laws of the States.  It will be observed that\r\neach of these three ballots is representative of a different method.\r\n\r\nIn the _first_ ballot shown, no party name appears, and the names of\r\ncandidates for each office are arranged in alphabetical order.  On this\r\nform of ballot, which most resembles that used in Australia, the\r\nindividual candidate is made prominent, and party connection does not\r\nappear at all.\r\n\r\n_Second_, In the Massachusetts ballot, the names of the candidates are\r\narranged alphabetically under each office, but in addition to this, the\r\nparty name appears opposite the name of each candidate.  On this form\r\nof ballot, while the party connection of each candidate is indicated,\r\ngreater prominence is given to the individual, and the voter is\r\nrequired to make choice of a candidate for each office separately.  He\r\ncannot vote a straight ticket by a single mark.\r\n\r\n_Third_, In the _Indiana_ ticket, the names are grouped according to\r\nparty, not according to office, the party name appearing at the head of\r\nthe ballot as well as at the side of each name.  On this form of\r\nballot, the party connection of the candidate is made most prominent,\r\nand while provision is made for voting for individuals representing\r\ndifferent parties, still the voting of a straight ticket is made most\r\neasy.\r\n\r\nMany States use the party-column principle of the Indiana ticket, but\r\nmodify the form of the ticket in various details.  The party emblem is\r\nsometimes omitted from the circle used in voting a straight picket, or\r\nplaced just above that circle.  The square opposite each candidate's\r\nname is sometimes placed after the name instead of before it; and is\r\nusually left blank.\r\n\r\nA _fourth_ form, namely, that of the _individual ballot_ as used in the\r\nState of _New Jersey_, can not be here shown, as a separate ballot is\r\nrequired for each party or each independent nomination.  These separate\r\nballots are all _official_, and are furnished at public expense; but\r\nthe use of an _unofficial_ ballot is practically allowed, since the\r\nvoter is permitted to take to the voting booth a paster ballot\r\ncontaining a complete party ticket, printed and furnished at party\r\nexpense.  This he can paste over the official ballot and deposit as his\r\nvote.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 1: First form of ballot type: City Ballot--no party\r\nnames, candidate names in alphabetic order.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration 2: Second form of ballot type: Massachusetts Official\r\nBallot.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration 3: Third form of ballot type: Indiana State Ballot.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n1.

Men have divers views as to the duties, scope, and proper\r\nmeasures of the government, and these divers views lead to the\r\nformation of opposing parties.  In a free country the majority must\r\nrule, and parties are the means by which majorities are ascertained.\r\n\r\nORIGIN.--Parties usually grow out of questions of legislation, rather\r\nthan out of questions of executive management or judicial\r\ninterpretation.  In other words, a party is formed to influence the\r\npassage of laws, rather than their execution or their application by\r\nthe courts.  But, when parties are once formed, they usually extend\r\ntheir influence to the selection of officers of all grades and all\r\ndepartments, even the least important officials of a township or civil\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nThe presidential election has come to be the most exciting and bitter\r\nof all political contests, because of the large influence which the\r\nPresident exerts upon national legislation, and because of the immense\r\npatronage of his office.\r\n\r\nNECESSITY.--Parties appear to be a necessity in all free governments.\r\nThey serve as check upon one another, as the party in power is\r\nresponsible for the public policy of the country.  If the people are\r\ndissatisfied with the party in power, they can displace it and elect\r\nanother in its stead.  Parties are therefore placed upon their good\r\nbehavior, and made to feel their responsibility to the people.\r\n\r\nIf there were no party organizations, many of the views of a candidate\r\nwould not be known, and there could be no assurance that he would be\r\ntrue to the interests of the majority electing him.  The fact that a\r\npublic man is a member of a certain party shows many of the views which\r\nhe entertains and the principles which he may be expected to support.\r\n\r\nParty government is often bad, but as the party is responsible for the\r\nconduct of all officers elected by it, party government, especially in\r\nlegislative affairs, is better than personal government, in which no\r\none but the officer himself is responsible for his official conduct.\r\n\r\nPARTY MACHINERY.--The machinery of parties in this country is very\r\ncomplex, and is closely interwoven with our system of government.  Each\r\nparty must select candidates for the various offices in the gift of the\r\npeople, in order that it may exert its greatest power in elections and\r\nin public affairs.  The people in each party must have a voice in the\r\nselection of candidates for township offices, district offices, county\r\noffices, State offices, and President and Vice President of the United\r\nStates.  Therefore each party has a system of committees, conventions,\r\nprimary elections, and caucuses, for ascertaining the choice of its\r\nmembers for these various offices.\r\n\r\nParties and party machinery are not generally provided for in the law,\r\nbut they exist by a custom almost as old as the government, and are\r\nfirmly fixed in our political system.\r\n\r\nCOMMITTEES.--Each of the great parties has a _national committee_,\r\nconsisting of one member from each State and Territory, chosen by its\r\nnational convention.  The national committee is the chief executive\r\nauthority of the party.  It calls the national convention, fixes the\r\ntime and place for holding it, and the representation to which each\r\nState and Territory is entitled.  It appoints a sub-committee of its\r\nmembers, called the _campaign_ or _executive committee_, which conducts\r\nthe political canvass or campaign, for the party.\r\n\r\nThe campaign committee distributes pamphlets, speeches, newspapers, and\r\nother political documents among the voters of the country; selects\r\npublic speakers; makes appointments for them to speak; arranges for\r\nparty meetings; collects funds to bear the expenses of the campaign,\r\nand has a general oversight of the party work in all the States.\r\n\r\nEach party also has a State committee in each State, usually consisting\r\nof a member from each congressional district, in some States consisting\r\nof a member from each county; a district committee in each\r\ncongressional, judicial, senatorial, and representative district,\r\nconsisting of a member from each county composing the district; a\r\ncounty committee, consisting of a member from each township or civil\r\ndistrict; and in some States, various other committees.\r\n\r\nEach of these committees performs for the division for which it is\r\nselected duties similar to those which the national committee performs\r\nfor the whole Union.\r\n\r\nCONVENTIONS.--The method of ascertaining the choice of a party in the\r\nselection of candidates is either by a primary election or by a\r\nconvention.\r\n\r\nA _political convention_ is an assemblage of the voters of a party,\r\neither in person or by representatives called delegates.  If the voters\r\nassemble in person, the convention is called a primary or mass meeting.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of a convention may be to select candidates for office, to\r\nsend delegates to a higher convention, to adopt a declaration of\r\nprinciples, or to decide upon a party policy.  It is common for two or\r\nmore of these purposes to come before the same convention.\r\n\r\nCALLING CONVENTIONS.--In the year of the presidential election, the\r\nnational committee calls a national convention, naming the time and\r\nplace, and the representation of each State.  The State committee calls\r\na State convention to send delegates to the national convention; and,\r\nif a State election is approaching, it may direct that the convention\r\nshall also select candidates for State offices.  In response to this\r\ncall, the county committees order county conventions in all the\r\ncounties of the State to send delegates to the State convention, and\r\nperhaps to select candidates for county offices.  In some States the\r\ntownship committees order township conventions in all townships for the\r\npurpose of sending delegates to the county conventions, and perhaps to\r\nname candidates for township offices.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the calling of the various conventions connected\r\ndirectly or indirectly with the selection of candidates for President\r\nand Vice President proceeds from the highest downward.  The same order\r\nis observed in other conventions, the call always beginning with the\r\nhighest committee concerned and proceeding to the lowest.\r\n\r\nLOCAL AND STATE CONVENTIONS.--The order of holding a system of\r\nconventions, however, proceeds from the lowest to the highest.  The\r\ntownship holds a convention and sends delegates to the county\r\nconvention.  The county convention sends delegates to the State\r\nconvention, and the State convention sends delegates to the national\r\nconvention.\r\n\r\nDELEGATES CHOSEN BY PRIMARIES.--In many states the delegates to all\r\nconventions are elected by the members of the party at primary\r\nelections.  In some states even the delegates to the national\r\nconvention are chosen in this manner.\r\n\r\nNATIONAL CONVENTION.--A national convention is an important assemblage.\r\nIt contains many distinguished men, and exerts great influence on the\r\nhistory of the country.  A national convention usually consists of more\r\nthan a thousand delegates.  In a Democratic convention, for instance,\r\nthere are four delegates from each State, two from each congressional\r\ndistrict, and a few from the Territories.\r\n\r\nIn the selection of delegates to the national convention, the State\r\nconvention often selects four, representing the two United States\r\nsenators, and the members of the convention from each congressional\r\ndistrict select two, representing the lower house of Congress.  For\r\neach delegate the State convention also selects an _alternate\r\ndelegate_, who attends the national convention in case the regular\r\ndelegate can not be present.\r\n\r\nThe national convention is called to order by the chairman of the\r\nnational committee.  It then elects a temporary chairman, and afterward\r\na permanent president.  The convention appoints the national committee,\r\ncalling upon the delegation from each State to name its member; adopts\r\na declaration of principles, called a _platform_, for the approaching\r\ncampaign; nominates candidates for President and Vice President, and\r\nperforms various other work connected with the party organization.\r\n\r\nPLATFORM.--The declaration of party principles adopted and issued by a\r\nconvention is called a platform, and each separate statement of a\r\nprinciple is popularly called a _plank_.\r\n\r\nThe platform is an announcement of the policy to be pursued by the\r\nparty if its candidates are elected, and is presumed to contain all the\r\nimportant principles upon which the voters of the party are agreed.\r\nUpon these principles the party claims the right to administer the\r\npublic affairs of the country.\r\n\r\nThe platforms of State and local conventions are usually based upon the\r\nnational platform of the same party, but also contain statements of\r\nprinciples upon local questions.\r\n\r\nNOMINATIONS.--To _nominate_ a candidate is to name him for office; that\r\nis, to place his name before the public.  The person nominated is\r\ncalled the nominee, and all the nominees for a certain election\r\nconstitute a ticket.\r\n\r\nA nomination usually secures to a candidate the general support of the\r\nparty.  Voters may vote for other persons than the nominees, but the\r\ngreat body of voters usually support the tickets of their respective\r\nparties.  Nomination serves to prevent a great number of candidates,\r\nand thus simplifies the election.\r\n\r\nPRIMARY ELECTIONS.--Candidates for township, county, and other offices\r\nare frequently chosen by means of primary elections.\r\n\r\nA _primary election_ is an election in which the members of a party\r\nchoose their candidates for office.  As a rule, none but the members of\r\nthe party holding it can vote in a primary election.  Many persons\r\nprefer the primary, to a convention, believing the former to be a\r\nfairer and more impartial method of ascertaining the choice of the\r\nparty.  The voting is usually by ballot.\r\n\r\nIn many States primary elections are under the control of the law, and\r\nare guarded by the same restrictions that pertain to other elections.\r\n\r\nCAUCUSES.--A meeting composed of the members of a legislative body who\r\nare of the same party, and assembled for party purposes, is called a\r\n_caucus_.  _Ward conventions_ in cities are sometimes called by the\r\nsame name.\r\n\r\nThe usual purpose of a caucus is to nominate candidates for offices\r\nwithin the gift of the legislative body, or to consider questions of\r\nlegislation.  A caucus elects a chairman and other officers, but rarely\r\nif ever adopts a platform of principles.  The great political parties\r\nof the country have caucuses in each branch of Congress, and usually in\r\nthe legislatures of the several States.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n1. Name the great parties that have existed in the United States.\r\n\r\n2. Who are the respective chairmen of the national executive committees\r\nof the two great parties?\r\n\r\n3. Read the last national platforms of the two great parties.\r\n\r\n4. Which do you like better, primary elections or conventions?  Why?\r\n\r\n5. Should a member of a legislative body be influenced in his vote by\r\nthe decision of the caucus of his party?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATION.\r\n\r\nLegislation, the act or process of making laws, is the most important\r\nfunction of government.  It is the most important, because it is the\r\nfirst step, and the enforcement and interpretation of laws depend upon\r\ntheir enactment.  The laws of a country should be as few in number, as\r\nsimple in construction, and as uniform in their application, as will\r\nmeet the needs of the people.  It is a great misfortune for the laws to\r\nbear unequally upon the people; to grant special privileges to one\r\nclass, or to impose special hardships upon another class.\r\n\r\nThe great variety and volume of laws made by the national and the State\r\nlegislatures of the United States have led to a close study of\r\nlegislation.  In no other country is the process of making laws so\r\nthoroughly mastered, or parliamentary law so generally understood.\r\n\r\nBILLS.--The process of enacting a law, from its introduction to its\r\nfinal approval, is an intricate and interesting study.  Until its\r\npassage and final approval, a measure is called either a _bill_ or a\r\n_resolution_.\r\n\r\nBills and resolutions are very similar, the latter usually being\r\nsimpler, and beginning with the words, \"Be it resolved\" or simply\r\n\"Resolved,\" while the former begin with the words, \"Be it enacted.\"  A\r\njoint resolution as well as a bill requires the concurrence of both\r\nhouses of a legislative assembly to make it a law.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.--The introduction of a bill is the first presentation of\r\nit to a legislative body for action.  This is usually done by asking\r\n\"leave\" of the body, either orally or in writing, to bring the measure\r\nbefore it.  This leave to present is rarely if ever refused.\r\n\r\nThe rules require that after its introduction it shall be three times\r\nread aloud before its passage.  These three readings do not refer to\r\nreadings for information as to its provisions.  The constitutions of\r\nnearly all States require that the three readings shall be on three\r\ndifferent days; but in most of them this rule, may be suspended by a\r\ntwo thirds, three fourths, four fifths, or unanimous vote, the\r\nrequisite majority varying in different States.\r\n\r\nCOMMITTEES.--When a bill or resolution is introduced, it is usual to\r\nrefer it to a committee for a critical consideration.  A _committee_\r\nusually consists of from three to thirteen members, of whom the first\r\nnamed is usually chairman, presumably selected for their knowledge of\r\nthe subjects to come before them.\r\n\r\nA _standing committee_ lasts during the entire session.  Most\r\nlegislative bodies have from twenty to forty standing committees.\r\n\r\nA _special_ or _select committee_ is raised for a special purpose, and\r\nis usually adjourned when its report is made.\r\n\r\nA _committee of the whole_ consists of all the members of a body\r\nsitting as a committee.  In committees of the whole the regular\r\npresiding officer usually vacates the chair, calling some other member\r\nof the body to act as chairman.  The principal part of the work of a\r\nlegislative body is perfected by its committees.  They discuss the\r\nmerits and demerits of bills, and perfect such as, in their judgment,\r\nshould pass.\r\n\r\nREPORTS.--The committee to whom a bill has been referred critically\r\nexamines it, and usually reports it to the body, either _favorably_ or\r\n_unfavorably_, recommending that it should pass or should not pass.  If\r\nthe members of a committee are equally or nearly equally divided as to\r\nthe merits of the bill, it may be reported without an expression of\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nWhen important bills are reported by a committee they are usually\r\ndiscussed by the members of the body.  The debate on the measure\r\nusually brings out the reasons for, and those against, its passage.\r\nMany bills are several times recommitted--that is, again referred to a\r\ncommittee--before their passage.\r\n\r\nIn some legislative bodies, especially in the Congress of the United\r\nStates, a great many bills are _pigeon-holed_ by committees; that is,\r\nare filed away and never reported.  The reports of the committees,\r\nwhether favorable or unfavorable, are usually adopted by the body, and\r\ntherefore have an important bearing upon legislation.\r\n\r\nAMENDMENTS.--In most legislative bodies a bill may be amended at the\r\npleasure of the majority, before it is read the third time.  Amendments\r\nare made for the purpose of perfecting the measure.  A bill may be\r\namended by striking out some of its provisions, by striking out and\r\ninserting, or by inserting.\r\n\r\nA bill passed by one house of a legislature maybe amended by the other\r\nhouse, but, if amended, must be returned with the amendment to the\r\nhouse in which it originated, in order that the amendment may be\r\nconsidered.  If one house amends and the other refuses to accept, the\r\nbill is often referred to a _conference committee_ of members of both\r\nhouses.  If this does not secure agreement, and both adhere to their\r\noriginal action, the bill fails.\r\n\r\nPASSAGE.--When a bill passes the house in which it originated, the\r\nclerk transmits and reports it to the other house for action.  The\r\nhouse to which it is transmitted may pass it without commitment, but\r\nusually refers it to a committee, and, when reported, may pass it or\r\nreject it, or amend it and return it with the amendment to the house in\r\nwhich it originated.\r\n\r\nWhen passed by both houses, the bill is engrossed--that is, rewritten\r\nwithout blots or erasures--and transmitted to the President or\r\ngovernor, as the case may be, for his approval.  If approved and\r\nsigned, or if not returned within a fixed time, the bill becomes a law.\r\nIf vetoed, it must be again considered by both bodies, and is lost\r\nunless again passed by each, and in Congress and in many States by a\r\ntwo thirds vote.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n1. Obtain from any convenient source and present in the recitation a\r\nsample of a bill, and also of a resolution.\r\n\r\n2. Why should a bill have three separate readings on three different\r\ndays?\r\n\r\n3. Why is the report of a committee generally adopted by the body?\r\n\r\n4. Why are chairmanships of committees usually much sought after in\r\nlegislative bodies?\r\n\r\n5. Present in the recitation a copy of the report of a legislative\r\ncommittee upon some subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nREVENUE AND TAXATION.\r\n\r\nRevenue.--The regulation of revenue and taxation is one of the most\r\nimportant and difficult questions of government.  One of the wisest of\r\nmodern statesmen has said that the management of finance _is_\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nGovernment, whatever its form, is an intricate and expensive machine,\r\nand therefore sure and ample sources of revenue are as necessary to it\r\nas blood is to the human body.  The necessary expenses of a local\r\ncommunity, such as a village, a city, or a county, are heavy; while\r\nthose of a State are immense, and those of a nation almost beyond\r\nconception.  These expenses must be promptly met, or the government\r\nbecomes bankrupt, lacking in respect, without power to enforce its\r\nrights even among its own people, and finally ceases to exist.\r\n\r\nTAXATION.--The chief source of revenue in all governments is taxation.\r\nA _tax_ is a portion of private property taken by the government for\r\npublic purposes.  _Taxation_, the act of laying taxes, is regarded as\r\nthe highest function of government.  It is also one of the most\r\ndelicate, because it touches the people directly, and is therefore\r\nfrequently the cause of discontent among the masses.\r\n\r\nThe government makes no direct return to the citizen for the taxes it\r\nexacts, and in this respect only does taxation differ from the exercise\r\nof the right of eminent domain.  How much revenue must be raised? what\r\narticles should be taxed? what should be the rate of taxation? are\r\nquestions that concern every government.\r\n\r\nAs a person may be at the same time a citizen of a village, a township,\r\na county, a State, and the United States, so he may, during the same\r\nyear, pay a separate tax to each of these five governments.\r\n\r\nNECESSITY OF TAXATION.--Taxation is one of the necessary burdens of\r\nsociety.  A government as well as an individual must have money to pay\r\nits expenses, and the principal part, if not all, of this money must be\r\nraised by taxation of one kind or another.  Men may differ as to the\r\nkind and the rate of taxation, but taxes must be paid in order that\r\ngovernment may exist.  The tax payer receives no immediate return for\r\nhis taxes, but has a _constant_ return in the way of protection to\r\nlife, liberty, and property, the enjoyment of public conveniences, and\r\nthe improvement of society.\r\n\r\nBy means of taxes each person bears his part in the cost of maintaining\r\nthe social compact.  He gives up a portion of his property in order\r\nthat what remains may be the more secure and valuable, and that he may\r\nenjoy many other blessings that would otherwise be impossible.\r\nAlthough the rate is often high, even higher than necessary, it is safe\r\nto say that every tax payer of the country receives from the government\r\nmore than he contributes by taxation.\r\n\r\nTaxes are direct or indirect.\r\n\r\nDIRECT TAXES.--A _direct tax_ is levied directly at a given rate upon\r\nproperty or polls.  Taxes levied by villages, towns, townships, cities,\r\ncounties, and States are for the most part direct taxes.\r\n\r\nA _poll_ tax is levied upon the polls, or heads, of the male\r\ninhabitants who have attained a certain age, usually twenty-one years.\r\n\r\nA _property tax_, as the name indicates, is levied upon property.\r\nProperty is of two kinds, real and personal.\r\n\r\n_Real property_, usually called _real estate_, consists of lands and\r\nbuildings.\r\n\r\n_Personal property_ is that which can be moved from place to place, and\r\nincludes everything that a person can own except real estate.\r\n\r\nIn all systems of taxation, much real estate, such as churches,\r\ncemeteries, colleges, charitable institutions, and public buildings, is\r\nexempt from taxes.\r\n\r\nFive times in its history--namely, in 1798, 1813, 1815, 1816, and\r\n1861--the United States levied a direct tax upon the people, but in\r\neach case the law was in force but a single year.  From 1861 to 1871\r\nthere was also an _income tax_; that is, a tax of a given per cent.\r\nupon all annual incomes that exceeded a certain amount.  In 1913,\r\nCongress passed a new income tax law, with additional taxes on very\r\nlarge incomes.\r\n\r\nINDIRECT TAXES.--An _indirect tax_ is assessed upon the property of one\r\nperson, but is indirectly paid by another.  The owner of the property\r\nat the time of assessment pays the tax to the government, but a part or\r\nall of the tax is ultimately paid by the consumer of the goods.  All\r\ntaxes now levied by the national government are indirect.\r\n\r\nThe indirect taxes levied by the national government are _customs_, or\r\n_duties_, and _internal revenue_.\r\n\r\nCUSTOMS, OR DUTIES.--_Customs_, or _duties_, are taxes levied upon\r\ncertain goods imported from foreign countries.  The Constitution\r\nprohibits the taxation of exports.\r\n\r\nThe schedule or list of articles taxed and of duties to be paid is\r\ncalled the _tariff_.  Custom dues are collected by officers of the\r\nnational government at the custom-houses, located at the ports of\r\nentry, usually, but not always, on or near the sea-coast.  By far the\r\nlarger portion of the national revenue is derived from customs.\r\n\r\nINTERNAL REVENUE.--_Internal revenue_, sometimes called _excise_, is a\r\ntax levied upon certain articles produced in this country, such as\r\ntobacco and spirituous liquors.  It is collected by officers of the\r\nnational government, called collectors, stationed in different parts of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n1.

As a safeguard and for the\r\nbetter administration of their affairs, the people of Georgia have\r\nestablished a Constitution.  The present Constitution was adopted by\r\ndelegates selected from Senatorial districts.  The delegates met in\r\nconvention and adopted the present Constitution in 1877.  All laws in\r\nGeorgia must be made in accordance with the Constitution of the United\r\nStates and the Constitution of Georgia.  They must also be executed\r\naccording to the provisions of these Constitutions.  The Constitution\r\nof Georgia can be amended by a two-thirds vote of the members of each\r\nbranch of the General Assembly, but the action of the General Assembly\r\nin amending the Constitution must be ratified by the voters at the next\r\nelection of members of the General Assembly; or, a new Constitution can\r\nbe made by another constitutional convention, which can be called only\r\nby two thirds of the members of each house of the General Assembly.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of Georgia places the administration of the civil\r\ngovernment of the State in three departments, the Legislative, the\r\nExecutive, and the Judicial.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE.--The Legislative department consists of two bodies,\r\nnamely, the _Senate_ and the House of Representatives.  The Senate is\r\ncomposed of forty-four members, one from each Senatorial district.  The\r\nSenatorial districts consist of three or more counties.  No one can be\r\nelected a State Senator who is not a citizen of the United States, who\r\nhas not attained the age of twenty-five years, and who has not been a\r\nresident of the State four years.\r\n\r\nThe _House of Representatives_ consists of one hundred and eighty-six\r\nmembers, apportioned among the different counties according to\r\npopulation.  The six counties having the largest population have three\r\nrepresentatives each; the twenty-six counties having the next largest\r\npopulation have two representatives each; the remaining one hundred\r\nsixteen counties have one representative each.  A member of the House\r\nof Representatives must be twenty-one years of age, and must have\r\nresided in the State four years, and in the county from which elected\r\none year.  The members of the Legislature are elected biennially on the\r\nfirst Wednesday in October.\r\n\r\nBoth members of the Senate and the House are chosen for terms of two\r\nyears at the general State elections.\r\n\r\nThe _General Assembly_ meets annually on the fourth Wednesday in June,\r\nand can make all laws deemed by its members proper and necessary for\r\nthe welfare of the State not in conflict with the Constitution of the\r\nState or Constitution of the United States.  A majority of each House\r\nconstitutes a quorum for the transaction of business.  Neither branch\r\nof the Legislature has the right to adjourn for a longer time than\r\nthree days without the consent of the other, but should they disagree\r\nupon a question of adjournment, the Governor may adjourn either or both\r\nof them.  The Acts of the Legislature which are approved by the\r\nGovernor and become laws are published each year for the information of\r\nthe public.  When the Legislature is called upon to elect some officer,\r\nboth branches meet in the hall of the House of Representatives, and the\r\nPresident of the Senate presides over the joint body and declares the\r\nresult.  No bill can be passed by the Legislature unless it receives a\r\nmajority vote of all members elected to each house of the General\r\nAssembly, and this fact must be shown by the journals of both houses.\r\nIt is also necessary for a measure to receive the signature of the\r\nGovernor before becoming a law.  When a bill is vetoed by the Governor\r\nit may be passed by a two-thirds vote of the members of each house,\r\nthus making his approval unnecessary.  The most important appointments\r\nmade by the Governor must be confirmed by the Senate before the\r\nappointments become effective.  The Senate has the sole power to hear\r\nimpeachment proceedings.  It requires a two-thirds vote of the Senate\r\nto sustain articles of impeachment before there can be a conviction.\r\nThe House of Representatives must first pass all bills for raising\r\nrevenue and appropriating money, but the Senate may propose or concur\r\nin amendments to such bills.  The right to institute impeachments is\r\nvested in the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nFRANCHISE.--Every male citizen of this State and of the United States\r\ntwenty-one years old, who has resided in the State one year prior to\r\nthe election, and in the county in which he offers to vote six months,\r\nwho has paid all taxes required of him by law since 1877, is an\r\nelector, and if registered, may vote.  Those who have not paid their\r\ntaxes, idiots, insane persons, illiterates of poor character who are\r\nneither ex-soldiers nor descendants of soldiers nor owners of a certain\r\namount of property, and persons convicted of serious crime, unless\r\npardoned, are disqualified from voting.\r\n\r\nREGISTRATION.--Before a citizen can become entitled to vote he is\r\nrequired to register.  On the first day of January of every year the\r\ntax collector opens a voters' book in which every person wishing to\r\nvote subscribes his name, showing that he is entitled to vote.  From\r\nthis book the tax collector prepares a list of registered voters of the\r\ncounty, which he files with the county registrars.  The county\r\nregistrars are appointed by the Judge of the Superior Court for a term\r\nof two years.  The county registrars take this list and compare it with\r\nthe list of disqualified voters prepared by the tax collector, the\r\nordinary, and the clerk of the Superior Court, and from the two prepare\r\na final list of registered voters.  Only those whose names appear on\r\nthe list of voters prepared by the registrars, are entitled to vote.\r\nOn or before the hour for opening the election a copy of the list of\r\nregistered voters is furnished the election managers.  All elections\r\nare presided over by three superintendents.  Votes are cast by ballot.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT.--The Executive Department of the State consists\r\nof the Governor, Secretary of State, State Treasurer, and\r\nComptroller-General.  Their powers and duties were originally vested in\r\nthe Governor and his Council, but now the duties of each office are\r\nseparate and distinct.\r\n\r\nThey are elected for a term of two years by the people of the State, at\r\nthe same time the members of the Legislature are elected.  The\r\nqualifications for these offices are: twenty-five years of age (for\r\nGovernor thirty), a citizen of the United States ten years (for\r\nGovernor fifteen), and of the State six years.\r\n\r\nThe _Governor_ is commander in chief of the army and naval forces of\r\nthe State.

The Governor can commute sentences, and\r\ngrant pardons to criminals, except in cases of treason or impeachment.\r\nHe is empowered to fill many important offices by appointment.  He\r\nissues commissions to all officers in the State.  He may issue\r\nproclamations of rewards for the apprehension of criminals.  He reports\r\nto the Legislature on the financial condition of the State, and gives\r\nsuggestions as to any general law that should be passed.\r\n\r\nThe _Secretary of State_ has the custody of the Great Seal of State and\r\nall State papers.  He preserves all the original bills and acts passed\r\nby the General Assembly.

He has control\r\nof the funds pledged to the payment of the public debt, and keeps\r\naccounts of all receipts and expenditures.  He acts also as _State Bank\r\nExaminer_.\r\n\r\nThe _Comptroller-General_ audits all accounts against the State.  He\r\nexamines the digests of all tax returns, receives and collects all\r\nevidences of debts due the State from any other source than taxes,\r\nissues executions against defaulting tax collectors, and countersigns\r\nall warrants drawn on the Treasury by the Governor.

He is _ex-officio\r\nInsurance Commissioner_, and has general supervision over all insurance\r\ncompanies doing business in Georgia.\r\n\r\nThis properly ends the executive department as fixed by the\r\nConstitution, but there are other State officers whose duties are such\r\nthat they really belong to the same class, and may be considered under\r\nthis head.\r\n\r\nThe _Attorney-General_ is the legal adviser of the executive\r\ndepartment.  He represents the State in all capital felonies in the\r\nSupreme Court, and in all civil and criminal cases in any court when\r\nrequired to do so by the Governor.  He is elected by the people for a\r\nterm of two years, and the same qualifications for this office apply as\r\ndo those for judges of the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nThe _State Superintendent of Schools_ is elected at the time when the\r\nGovernor is elected, for a term of two years.  He is charged with the\r\nadministration of the school laws.  He has general superintendence of\r\nthe business relating to public schools.

He appoints, with the advice and consent of the\r\nState Board of Education, an experienced _auditor_ to examine and\r\nreport on the accounts of all schools and colleges receiving State aid.\r\n\r\nThe State Superintendent of Schools is _ex-officio_ a member of the\r\nState Board of Education, the State School-Book Commission, the State\r\nGeological Board, the Board of Trustees of the State Normal School at\r\nAthens, and the South Georgia Normal School at Valdosta.\r\n\r\nThe _Commissioner of Agriculture_ is elected by the people of the State\r\nfor a term of two years, at the same time that the governor is elected.\r\n\r\nHe has charge and control of the inspection and sale of all fertilizers\r\nsold in the State.  The law requires all manufacturers and dealers in\r\nfertilizers in Georgia to first register all the brands to be sold.\r\nThe law authorizes the Commissioner to appoint six inspectors for a\r\nterm of one year each, and such other additional inspectors as may be\r\nrequired, to be paid for the actual time they are in service.  After\r\nthe samples are taken by these inspectors, they are forwarded to the\r\nCommissioner, who turns them over to the State Chemist, he making an\r\nanalysis of the goods.  If the analysis shows anything radically wrong,\r\nthe Commission takes it up with the fertilizer manufacturers who sold\r\nthe fertilizer, and the party who bought it.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner of Agriculture is also charged with the inspection of\r\nfoods, drugs, feeding stuffs, and of all oils of illuminating quality\r\nsold in the State.  It is his duty to enforce the provisions of the\r\nPure Food and Drug Laws, and he appoints a food inspector and a drug\r\ninspector.  Both of these inspectors make their report to the\r\nCommissioner, and all samples taken are sent to the State Chemist for\r\nanalysis.  The Commissioner also has charge of the inspection of cattle\r\nin Georgia to protect them against diseases of all kinds.  This\r\ndepartment is called the _Bureau of Animal Inspection_, and is in the\r\ncharge of the _State Veterinarian_, with a corps of assistants, all of\r\nwhom are appointed by the Commissioner.  This Bureau cooperates with\r\nthe United States Department of Agriculture in Tick Eradication and Hog\r\nCholera Contagion; and the general development of live stock industry.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner of Agriculture also has charge of the horticultural\r\ninterests, peaches, apples, fruits, and vines, of all description.\r\nUnder the law he appoints an _entomologist_ who may visit all the\r\norchards and vineyards, and inspect them for the purpose of keeping\r\ndown all diseases affecting the fruit in Georgia.  In a general way the\r\nCommissioner of Agriculture is expected to look after the common good\r\nof the State connected with the varied farming interests.\r\n\r\nBy virtue of his office, the Commissioner of Agriculture is\r\n_ex-officio_ a member of the board of Trustees of the State Board of\r\nAgriculture, Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Georgia\r\nExperiment Station, and also Chairman of the State Board of Entomology.\r\n\r\nThe _State Chemist_ is in charge of the laboratory in connection with\r\nthe Department of Agriculture.

He appoints game and fish wardens and deputy\r\nwardens in each county of the State to assist him in enforcing the\r\nlaws, and in issuing licenses to proper persons to hunt and fish in the\r\nopen season, in accordance with certain restrictions and regulations.\r\n\r\nThe _State Tax Commissioner_ is appointed by the Governor, with the\r\napproval of the Senate, for a term of six years.  His office is at the\r\nState Capitol in connection with the Comptroller-General.  He acts as\r\nassistant to the Comptroller-General.  He investigates all matters\r\nrelative to taxation, and makes recommendations to the General\r\nAssembly, as to any alterations or changes that may bring about a more\r\nperfect and equitable system of taxation.  It is his duty to examine\r\ncarefully and compare the tax digests of the several counties of the\r\nState, to the end that property located in different counties may bear\r\nits equitable burden of taxation.\r\n\r\nThe _Adjutant General_ is appointed by the Governor for the term of the\r\nGovernor's tenure.  He is at the head of the Military Department of the\r\nState, subordinate only to the Governor as Commander in Chief of the\r\nmilitary forces of the State.

He may act as\r\na mediator between employers and employees in the case of strikes, and\r\ntender his good offices to the opposing parties with a view to bringing\r\nabout friendly and satisfactory adjustments.  He makes a full report to\r\nthe Governor, with such recommendations as may be likely to promote the\r\nefficiency of his Department.\r\n\r\nThe _Railroad Commission_ consists of five members, one or two being\r\nelected every second year, for a term of six years.  It is the duty of\r\nthe Commission to protect the people from excessive passenger or\r\nfreight rates on the various railroads operating in the State, and to\r\nprevent unjust discrimination.  The Commissioners have the power to\r\nexamine the books of any railroad company, to examine its officers and\r\nagents as to their methods of conducting the business of the road, and\r\nto examine the road to see that it is not in an unsafe and dangerous\r\ncondition, and when any part is found to be unsafe, to require the\r\ncompany to put it in such condition as will render travel safe and\r\nexpeditious.\r\n\r\nThe Commission also has a similar control over street railroads,\r\nwharves, docks, gas, electric light and power, terminal, express,\r\ntelephone, telegraph, and cotton compress companies.  The Commission is\r\ncalled upon to consider, hear, and adjust multitudes of differences and\r\ncomplaints that arise in reference to services, rates, and practices of\r\nmore than two hundred public service corporations that are within its\r\nsupervisory and regulatory jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nEach of the companies, or corporations, over which the Railroad\r\nCommission has authority, before issuing stocks, bonds, notes, or other\r\nevidence of debt payable more than twelve months after the date\r\nthereof, must secure the approval and authority of the Commission; also\r\nthey must show the purpose and use for which such issues are authorized.\r\n\r\nThe _Prison Commission_ consists of three Commissioners elected by the\r\npeople for a term of six years.  The Commissioners elect one of their\r\nnumber chairman.  All convicts, all convict camps, and the State Farm\r\nare under the direct supervision of the Prison Commission, which\r\nprovides rules and regulations, subject to the approval of the\r\nGovernor, for their management, discipline, and sanitation.  Some\r\nmember of the Prison Commission makes personal visits to the various\r\nconvict camps of the State every six months and makes a thorough\r\ninspection of every detail of management, plan of operation,\r\nsanitation, and treatment of the convicts.  The Commission apportions\r\nthe convicts to the various counties desiring to use convict labor on\r\nthe public roads.\r\n\r\nThe Prison Commission hears applications for pardons and makes\r\nrecommendations for executive clemency to the Governor, but he may\r\nreject their advice.\r\n\r\nJUDICIAL SYSTEM.--The judicial branch of our State government is vested\r\nin the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals, superior courts, county,\r\nand city courts, courts of ordinary, justice courts, and courts\r\nrecently established in certain cities in lieu of justice courts.\r\n\r\nThe difference in the courts consists of their varied jurisdiction.\r\nJurisdiction is the power to hear and determine cases.  Two questions\r\nare usually involved in determining the jurisdiction of a court.\r\nFirst, the residence of the defendant, and, second, the amount involved\r\nand the subject matter of the litigation.  The jurisdiction of a court\r\nis usually limited to a particular territory, and, with the exception\r\nof the superior courts, it is limited as to the character of the\r\nlitigation.\r\n\r\nIn each  militia district of every county of the State, except in\r\ncertain cities, there is a _justice court_.  This court was established\r\nfor the trial of cases involving small amounts, and for the preliminary\r\ntrials of persons charged with offenses against the laws of the State.\r\nThe justice is elected for a term of four years by the voters of the\r\ncounty.  To be eligible for this office one must have been a resident\r\nof the district for three months, and such other qualifications apply\r\nas do to voters for members of the General Assembly.  This court holds\r\nits sessions monthly.\r\n\r\nUpon the recommendation of the grand jury of the county, a _notary\r\npublic_ and _ex-officio justice of the peace_ may be appointed by the\r\njudge of the superior court and commissioned by the Governor.  His\r\npowers are the same as a regularly elected justice, and his term of\r\noffice is for the same number of years.\r\n\r\nThe jurisdiction of the court extends to all cases arising from\r\ncontracts, or injuries, or damages to personal property, when the\r\namount claimed does not exceed $100.  Contests for the possession of\r\npersonal property, when the title is not involved, may also be tried in\r\njustice courts.  When the amount involved is less than $50 an appeal\r\nmay be had to a jury of five men; if the amount exceeds $50, an appeal\r\nmay be had to the superior court.\r\n\r\nUpon the arrest of any person charged with any offense against the laws\r\nof the State he can be brought before the justice of the peace for a\r\npreliminary trial.  If in the opinion of the justice there is\r\nsufficient evidence, he is bound over to a higher court for trial.\r\n\r\nThe justice of the peace can issue warrants for the arrest of persons\r\ncharged with crimes, and is qualified to administer oaths.  The\r\nexecutive officer of the justice court is the _constable_, who is\r\nelected by the people for a term of two years.  He serves subpoenas,\r\nlevies executions, conducts the sales of the court, and makes arrests.\r\n\r\nIn 1912, the provisions of the Constitution recommending the\r\nestablishment of justice courts in each militia district were amended\r\nso as to allow such justice courts, the office of justice of the peace,\r\nand of notary public, _ex-officio_ justice of the peace, to be\r\nabolished in certain cities in Georgia by the establishment in lieu\r\nthereof of such court, or system of courts, as the General Assembly may\r\ndeem necessary.  Such courts have been established in Atlanta and\r\nMacon.  The territory, jurisdiction, and power of these courts are set\r\nforth in the act creating them.\r\n\r\nA _county court_ is established upon the recommendation of a grand jury\r\nin a county.  The judge of the court is appointed by the Governor for a\r\nterm of four years.  The judge of a county court must be twenty-one\r\nyears of age, and must have been a resident of the county one year.\r\nThe court holds monthly and quarterly sessions at the county seat.  The\r\njurisdiction of the court extends over the county where it is located.\r\nThe court has jurisdiction in all civil cases where the amount involved\r\ndoes not exceed $500, save where exclusive jurisdiction is given to the\r\nsuperior courts.  Criminal cases are also tried in county courts when\r\nthe crime with which the defendant is charged is called a misdemeanor.\r\nIn some counties also there are county courts established by special\r\nacts of the Legislature.\r\n\r\nMany _city courts_ have been established by the Legislature.  The judge\r\nof a city court is appointed by the Governor, or elected by the people,\r\naccording to the provisions of the act establishing the court.  The\r\nterm and the qualifications of the judge, and the jurisdiction of the\r\ncity court, are also fixed by the legislative act creating the court.\r\nThe term is sometimes four years and sometimes two.\r\n\r\nThe _solicitor_ of the city court is appointed by the Governor, or\r\nelected by the people, for a term of two or four years.  It is his duty\r\nto represent the State in all criminal cases tried in that court.\r\n\r\nThere is in each county of the State a _court of ordinary_.  The\r\npresiding officer of this court is styled the _ordinary_.  He is\r\nelected by the voters of the county for a term of four years.  The\r\njurisdiction of the court of ordinary extends throughout the county\r\nover all matters relating to the administration of property of deceased\r\npersons, orphans, idiots, lunatics, and insane persons.  In the\r\nordinary is vested the power of appointing guardians of the person of\r\norphans and insane persons.  The ordinary also has charge of county\r\nroads and revenues where no board of county commissioners has been\r\nestablished.  The ordinary is clerk of his own court, and the sheriff\r\nof the county is his executive officer.\r\n\r\nThe State is divided into twenty-six _judicial circuits_, and each\r\ncircuit has one _superior court judge_ (or mote than one if the\r\nLegislature so provides).  This judge is elected by the people for a\r\nterm of four years.  To be eligible he must be thirty years of age; he\r\nmust have been a citizen of the State for three years, and must have\r\npracticed law seven years.\r\n\r\nThe _superior courts_ have original and appellate jurisdiction.\r\nActions may be begun in this court, and actions may be appealed to this\r\ncourt.  The original jurisdiction of this court extends exclusively\r\nover all suits for divorce, suits where titles to land are involved,\r\ncases in equity, and criminal cases where the person is accused of a\r\ncrime the punishment for which is loss of life or imprisonment in the\r\npenitentiary.  Offenses of a lesser grade are called misdemeanors.  The\r\ncourt has jurisdiction over all civil cases.  The _judge_ of the\r\nsuperior court has the power to issue various writs for the enforcement\r\nof the law, and grant charters to all corporations, except banking,\r\ninsurance, railroad, canal, navigation, express, telephone, and\r\ntelegraph companies.  Cases appealed from justice courts, county\r\ncourts, courts of ordinary, and certain city courts lie to the superior\r\ncourts.\r\n\r\nThe _clerk_ of the Superior court is elected by the people for a term\r\nof two years.  He has custody of all court papers, records, liens,\r\ndeeds, mortgages, and other conveyances, issues executions, subpoenas,\r\ncommissions to take interrogatories, and other writs with the authority\r\nof the court.  He also has the power to administer oaths.\r\n\r\nThe _sheriff_ of the county is properly a county officer, but his\r\nduties are closely allied with the superior court.  He is elected by\r\nthe people for a term of two years.  It is his duty to execute all\r\norders of the court, attend in person or by deputy all its sessions,\r\nkeep a record of all sales and executions, publish advertisements of\r\nsales, and conduct sales at the county seat.  He levies executions,\r\nserves warrants, and executes all the writs of the judge of the\r\nsuperior court.  The sheriff may appoint deputies to assist him in the\r\nperformance of his duties.\r\n\r\nThe _solicitor-general_ is elected by the people for a term of four\r\nyears.  He must have been three years a citizen of the State, he must\r\nbe twenty-five years of age, and must have practiced law three years.\r\nHe is the solicitor of the whole circuit, and is not a county officer.\r\nHe advises the grand jury, examines witnesses before that body, and\r\ndraws up all indictments and presentments.  It is his duty to prosecute\r\nor defend any civil action in his circuit in which the State is\r\ninterested, collect moneys arising from fines and forfeited bonds, and\r\nall claims of the State, as ordered by the Comptroller-General.  He\r\nrepresents the State in all criminal actions in the superior court, of\r\nwhich he is the solicitor, and in the Court of Appeals or the Supreme\r\nCourt in cases appealed from his circuit.\r\n\r\nThe _Court of Appeals_ consists of three judges, elected one every\r\nsecond year for a term of six years.  The _Supreme Court_ consists of a\r\nchief justice and five associate justices.  They are elected two every\r\nsecond year for a term of six years.  A judge of the Court of Appeals\r\nor a justice of the Supreme Court must be thirty years of age, must\r\nhave been a resident of the State three years, and must have practiced\r\nlaw seven years.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals has appellate jurisdiction in cases appealed from\r\ncertain city courts, and in criminal cases, not capital, appealed from\r\nthe superior courts.  The Supreme Court has appellate jurisdiction in\r\ncivil cases appealed from the superior courts, and in all cases of\r\nconviction of capital crime.  The Supreme Court also settles any\r\nquestion as to the meaning of the Constitution, and as to the\r\nconstitutionality of a State law.  It is the highest judicial authority\r\nin the State.\r\n\r\nCOUNTIES.--The State is divided into one hundred and forty-eight\r\ncounties, and each county into militia districts, according to its size\r\nand population.  Every militia district in the State must contain at\r\nthe time of its organization at least one hundred male residents over\r\ntwenty-one years of age who are subject to militia duty, and no militia\r\ndistrict can be reduced in population below this requirement by the\r\nformation of a new one.  While no additional counties can be created in\r\nthe State except by a constitutional amendment, one may be abolished or\r\nmerged into adjoining counties by a two-thirds majority of the voters\r\nof the county.\r\n\r\nEach county in the State has an organized government, with powers\r\ndelegated to it by the State government.  These powers are largely\r\nadministrative, and have for their chief purpose the enforcement of\r\ngeneral laws.  Each county is a body corporate, with the power to sue\r\nor be sued in any court, make contracts, and buy and sell real estate.\r\nIts debt cannot exceed seven per cent of the assessed valuation of the\r\ntaxable property.\r\n\r\nORDINARY.--The office of ordinary is the most important in the county.\r\nHe is the principal administrative officer in the county.  When sitting\r\nfor county purposes he has exclusive jurisdiction in directing and\r\ncontrolling all county property and in levying general and special\r\ntaxes.  He has control over all roads and bridges, establishes and\r\nalters election precincts and militia districts, appoints officers to\r\nfill all vacancies in the county.  He audits the accounts of all county\r\nofficers, makes rules and regulations for the relief of the poor.  He\r\nissues marriage licenses, pays pensions to Confederate veterans,\r\nlicenses and regulates peddling, and collects special taxes assessed by\r\nthe State.  He is elected for a term of four years.\r\n\r\nHe is both a judicial and an administrative officer.  His judicial\r\nduties have been explained.\r\n\r\nA part of his administrative duties as to roads and revenues is\r\nperformed in some counties by a board of county commissioners.\r\n\r\nCOUNTY COMMISSIONERS.--A board of county commissioners may be created\r\nby the General Assembly to administer the executive powers of the\r\nordinary.  The powers of the commissioners differ in the various\r\ncounties, and their duties are prescribed by the act creating them.\r\nThey are called commissioners of roads and revenues.  When county\r\ncommissioners are provided for by legislative enactment the ordinary\r\nceases to perform the duties given to the commissioners.\r\n\r\nJURY COMMISSIONERS.--The board of jury commissioners is composed of six\r\nmembers, who are appointed by the judge of the superior court for a\r\nterm of six years.  Two members are appointed every second year.\r\n\r\nThis body meets in August, biennially, to revise the jury list.  It\r\nselects from the books of the tax receiver \"upright and intelligent\r\nmen\" to serve as jurors.  The most intelligent and experienced are\r\nselected for the grand jury.  The name of each person subject to serve\r\non the jury is written on a separate slip of paper and placed in the\r\n\"jury box.\"  At each term of the superior court the judge draws out of\r\nthis box from eighteen to thirty names, from which the grand jury is\r\nimpaneled.  In the same manner thirty-six names are drawn for the petit\r\njury.\r\n\r\n_Grand Jury_.--The grand jury consists of not less than eighteen nor\r\nmore than twenty-three members.  A foreman is elected by the jury.  It\r\nis their duty to indict or present for trial all persons who from their\r\nown knowledge, or from evidence brought before them, are charged with\r\nan offense against the laws, and against whom sufficient evidence is\r\nproduced to sustain the charge.  It is also their duty to inspect the\r\nbooks and accounts of all county officers, examine the tax receiver's\r\ndigest, and inquire into the condition and management of the county\r\nroads, jails, and schoolhouses.  It advises the ordinary in the\r\nadministration of the county tax, determines the salary of the county\r\njudge, jurors, and bailiffs, and appoints the members of the board of\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n_County Treasurer_.--All revenue paid into the county arising from\r\ntaxes, and all other sources, is paid to the county treasurer, who\r\ndisburses it only upon warrants issued by the ordinary or board of\r\ncounty commissioners.\r\n\r\n_Tax Receiver_.--It is the duty of the tax receiver to secure from\r\neach taxpayer, under oath, a statement of the character and amount\r\nof his taxable property.  Three digests are prepared from the full\r\nreturns made to the tax receiver, who must furnish one to the\r\nComptroller-General, the tax collector, and the ordinary.\r\n\r\n_Tax Collector_.--It is the duty of the tax collector to collect all\r\ntaxes due the State and county, and to pay the same over to the\r\nComptroller-General and County Treasurer, the portion due the State\r\ngoing to the Comptroller-General.  He is to search out and ascertain as\r\nfar as possible all poll and professional taxes due and unpaid, and all\r\ntaxable property not found in the digest, and to assess the same and\r\ncollect thereon a double tax.  He also issues against all defaulters,\r\nexecutions, which are placed with the proper officials for collection.\r\n\r\n_Road Commissioners_.--Each county is arranged into road districts in\r\norder that the labor and expense may be divided as equally as possible\r\nthroughout the county.  Three commissioners are appointed in every\r\ndistrict for a term of two years, and are excused only for providential\r\ncauses; but while serving they are exempt from jury, militia, and other\r\nroad duty.\r\n\r\nAll male residents of the State between the ages of sixteen and fifty\r\nyears are subject to work on the public roads, with the exception of\r\npreachers, cripples, and employees of the Insane Asylum, and the like.\r\nNo person, however, is required to work for a longer time than fifteen\r\ndays in the year, or for a longer time than five days in succession.\r\nThe commissioners have the power to fine or imprison defaulters.\r\nCounties may, however, adopt an alternative plan for working the roads:\r\nin such counties a special tax is levied on property, the proceeds of\r\nwhich are spent on the roads, and able-bodied men between eighteen and\r\nfifty years of age are subject to road duty for not more than five days\r\neach year, or they may pay a small commutation tax instead.\r\n\r\nCORONER.--The principal duty of the coroner is to hold inquests, with a\r\njury composed of six electors, over the bodies of all persons who have\r\ndied suddenly and under suspicious circumstances.  Upon the verdict of\r\nthe jury, the coroner may commit to prison, to await trial, any person\r\nfound guilty of homicide.  The coroner is also _ex-officio_ sheriff\r\nwhen the latter is disqualified or absent from the county.\r\n\r\n_County Surveyor_.--The county surveyor makes surveys of county and\r\ndistrict lines, and such other surveys as are required by the\r\nComptroller-General.\r\n\r\nCITIES AND TOWNS.--Where the necessity demands it in very thickly\r\npopulated districts, and where the county government would be\r\ninadequate for the requirements of the community, local governments are\r\nestablished, which are termed _municipal corporations_.\r\n\r\nSuch corporations are chartered by the General Assembly, and the form\r\nof government of each municipality is prescribed in the act creating\r\nit.  No distinction is drawn in Georgia between towns and cities.\r\n\r\nThe form of the municipal government conforms to a large extent to that\r\nof the State government, the legislative power being delegated to a\r\ncouncil or board of aldermen, the executive to the mayor, and the\r\njudicial to a recorder, or some one performing the duties usually given\r\nto this officer.\r\n\r\nThe council is composed of the _mayor_ and a number of _councilmen_.\r\nThey are elected by the voters, usually for a term of one or two years.\r\nThe councilmen in some places are elected from various city wards; in\r\nothers they are elected by the town or city at large.  In some cities\r\nthe _recorder_ is elected by the council, and in some he is elected by\r\nthe people.  In some the mayor performs the duties of the recorder.\r\n\r\nUnder some charters, the city comptroller, tax collector, treasurer,\r\nand city attorneys are elected by the voters, while the minor officers,\r\nsuch as the city clerk, tax assessors, members of the board of health,\r\nthe board of education, and the board of police commissioners, are\r\nelected by the council.\r\n\r\nThe revenue of a city is derived from a general tax on all real and\r\npersonal property, which must be uniform, and a license tax on all\r\noccupations, which is varied with the occupation.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION.--There is a thorough system of public schools for the\r\neducation of the children of the State, the expenses of which are\r\nprovided for by taxation or otherwise.  The schools are free to all\r\nchildren of the State, but separate schools are provided for white and\r\ncolored children.  The State appropriates money directly to the support\r\nof the public schools.\r\n\r\nAuthority may be granted to counties, school districts, or to\r\nmunicipalities, upon the recommendation of the corporate authority, to\r\nmaintain schools by local taxation, levied in addition to the amount\r\nappropriated by the State.  But such a law takes effect in any county\r\ndistrict, or municipality, only if ratified by a two-thirds majority of\r\nthe citizens voting on the question.\r\n\r\nThe _State Superintendent of Schools_ is the executive head of the\r\nschool system of the State, and to him are submitted reports from the\r\ncounty school superintendents.  He prepares the questions for teachers'\r\nexaminations.\r\n\r\nThe _State Board of Education_ is composed of the Governor, State\r\nSuperintendent of Schools, and four other persons who are appointed by\r\nthe Governor and confirmed by the Senate.  At least three of these\r\nappointees must be men of practical experience in teaching schools and\r\nof high standing in educational work, having had at least three years'\r\npractical experience in the schools of Georgia.\r\n\r\nThe board is authorized to receive bequests for education, and invest\r\nthe principal sums when the interest only is to be expended.  The board\r\nis an appellate and advisory body.  The State Superintendent of Schools\r\nis required to advise with the board for the better performance of his\r\nduties, and appeals from his decisions lie to the board.\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of the State Board of Education to provide rules and\r\nregulations for the supervision of all schools in the State; to provide\r\nthe course of study and select textbooks for all common and high\r\nschools of the State receiving State aid; also to provide a system of\r\ncertification for the teachers of the public schools.\r\n\r\nThe schools of each county are under the control of a _County Board of\r\nEducation_.  The grand jury of a county selects five citizens to serve\r\non the board for the term of four years.  The county is divided by the\r\nboard into school districts, and a school is established in each\r\ndistrict which may have three trustees who act under the general\r\nsupervision of the County Board of Education.\r\n\r\nThe board employs teachers, rents property, buys school furniture, and\r\nmakes all arrangements necessary for the efficient operation of the\r\nschools.\r\n\r\nThe _County School Superintendent_ is elected by the qualified voters\r\nof each county for a term of four years.  Under a recent act the term\r\nof all these officials is uniform and expires January 1, 1917.  He must\r\nbe a resident of the county in which he offers for election and be a\r\nperson of good moral character.  In addition to the above there are\r\nfour tests laid down by law and the County School Superintendent must\r\nqualify under at least one of these:--\r\n\r\n1. Three years' experience in teaching, one year of which shall have\r\nbeen in Georgia, and the possession of a first-grade license.\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n2. A diploma from a reputable college or normal school.\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n3. Five years' experience in actual school supervision.\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n4. An approved examination before the State Board of Education as to\r\nqualifications.\r\n\r\nIt is his duty to examine on a day advertised for that purpose all\r\napplicants for licenses to teach, and to grade such applicants\r\naccording to the instructions of the State Superintendent of Schools.\r\nHe is a medium between the State Superintendent of Schools and all\r\nsubordinate school officers, and acts as the agent of the County Board\r\nof Education in purchasing school furniture, apparatus, and all\r\neducational requisites.\r\n\r\nBesides partly supporting the public schools, the State supports other\r\ninstitutions for higher learning.  These institutions, though situated\r\nin different parts of the State, are collectively known as the\r\n_University of Georgia_, which has its seat at Athens.  The head of all\r\nthese institutions is styled the _Chancellor_, but each has its\r\nPresident and separate board of trustees.  The trustees are appointed\r\nby the Governor for various terms.\r\n\r\nThe University of Georgia consists of the college at Athens and the\r\nfollowing branches: The Georgia Normal and Industrial College, State\r\nNormal School, South Georgia State Normal School, State College of\r\nAgriculture, North Georgia Agricultural College, Medical College,\r\nTechnological School, and Georgia State Industrial College for Colored\r\nYouths.\r\n\r\nThe educational system of Georgia is being constantly improved by\r\nvoluntary local taxation supplementing the State funds.  Every child in\r\nGeorgia is entitled to receive a thorough education, suited to the\r\nstation in life to which he can reasonably aspire.  This much should be\r\ndemanded.  Nothing less should be accepted as sufficient.  May the time\r\nsoon come when the people of Georgia will realize that money spent to\r\ndevelop the minds and characters of their children is the best\r\ninvestment to be made for them in time and eternity.\r\n\r\nELEEMOSYNARY INSTITUTIONS.--At the expense of the whole people, the\r\nState of Georgia maintains the following eleemosynary institutions:\r\nGeorgia Academy for the Blind, Macon; Georgia School for the Deaf, Cave\r\nSpring; the Soldiers' Home of Georgia, Atlanta, Georgia State\r\nSanitarium for the Insane, Milledgeville; Georgia State Tuberculosis\r\nSanitarium, Alto; and the Georgia Training School for Girls.",
