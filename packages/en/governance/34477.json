Unfortunately\r\nfor the moral, that constitutional demands should therefore be promptly\r\nand fully conceded, the statement is almost exactly the reverse of the\r\ntruth, if Irish history as a whole be taken as the field for induction.\r\nThe Irish Nation cannot be said to have at any period abandoned its claim\r\nto independence. Of the meaning of that claim there was no question from\r\nthe Conquest to the fall of Limerick. The whole of that period is occupied\r\nby a long struggle between the English and the Irish peoples for the\r\neffective possession of the island. On neither side was there any\r\nmisapprehension of the meaning and object of the contest. The English\r\nGovernment, whether it employed naked force, intrigue or legal fiction,\r\naimed (and was understood to aim) at the moral, material and political\r\nsubjugation of the Irish: the Irish, whether they fought in the field or\r\nintrigued in the cabinets of Europe, whether allied with France or with\r\nSpain or English royalists, had but one object, the assertion of their\r\nnational independence. It was a struggle not merely between two nations\r\nbut between two civilizations. Men of English blood who were absorbed by\r\nthe Irish nation and who accepted the Irish civilization fought as stoutly\r\nfor the independence of their adopted (and adopting) country as did the\r\ndescendants of the Milesians. England could never count on the fidelity to\r\nher ideals and policy in Ireland of the second generation of her own\r\nsettlers. History cannot produce another instance of a struggle so\r\nprolonged and so pertinacious. Whole counties, stripped by fire and sword\r\nof their aboriginal owners were repeopled within two or three generations\r\nand renewed the struggle. But superior numbers and organization, a more\r\nfortunate star and (it seemed) the designs of Providence, prevailed in the\r\nend; and with the fall of Limerick England might have regarded her task as\r\nat last accomplished. The Irish Nation was prostrate, and chains were\r\nforged for it which, heavier and more galling than any forged for any\r\nnation before, seemed to offer a perpetual guarantee of slavery, misery\r\nand degradation. Ireland was henceforth to be administered as a kind of\r\nconvict settlement. The law, in the words of a famous judgment, did not\r\npresume the existence of such a person as a Catholic Irishman; that is to\r\nsay, two-thirds of the inhabitants of the country had no legal existence.\r\nLegal existence was the privilege of Protestant Englishmen living in\r\nIreland and of such Protestant Irishmen as claimed it. But legal existence\r\nin Ireland during the eighteenth century was no prize to be grasped at.\r\nThe mere fact of residence in Ireland entailed practical disabilities for\r\nwhich no mere local ascendancy was an adequate compensation. The\r\nmanufactures and trade of Ireland were systematically and ruthlessly\r\nsuppressed. Englishmen who settled there found that while they were at\r\nliberty to oppress \"the mere Irish\" they were subject themselves to a\r\nsimilar oppression by the English who remained at home. No one might enter\r\nthat prison house and remain wholly a man. The \"garrison\" grumbled,\r\nprotested and threatened, but in vain. Constitutionalists appealed to the\r\npolicy of the Conquest in support of the independence of the country. It\r\nwas argued that the Parliament of Ireland, established by the conquerors\r\nas a symbol of annexation, was and ought to be independent of the\r\nParliament of England. The claim was held to be baseless and treasonable;\r\nso far from being abandoned or weakened, it was enforced and asserted by\r\nthe arms of the Volunteers, and in less than a century after the fall of\r\nLimerick the Renunciation Act of 1783 enacted that the people of Ireland\r\nshould be \"bound only by laws enacted by his Majesty and the parliament of\r\nthat kingdom in all cases whatever.\"\r\n\r\nBut while this was independence, it was independence in the sense of\r\nMolyneux, Swift and Grattan, not in the sense in which it had been\r\nunderstood by Hugh O'Neill. The American colonies went farther and fared\r\nbetter, and the descendants of the race of Hugh O'Neill had to be reckoned\r\nwith still. Their position under the settlement of 1783 was what it had\r\nbeen since the Treaty of Limerick was broken by the Penal Laws, and all\r\nthat they gained at first was an indirect share in the prosperity which\r\nbegan for the country with the assertion of its legislative independence.\r\nThe population increased; trade, commerce and manufactures flourished and\r\nmultiplied; the flag of Ireland began once more to creep forth upon the\r\nseas; but the ancient race was still proscribed in the land of its birth.\r\nBut while it was in human nature to invent, it was not in human nature to\r\ncontinue to administer, a code so diabolical as that of the Penal Laws.\r\nThe Volunteers who claimed legislative independence of England asserted\r\nthe rights of conscience for their fellow-countrymen. Under the free\r\nParliament a gradual alleviation took place in the lot of Catholics in\r\nIreland; in 1793 they were admitted to the franchise and there is a\r\npresumption that had the Irish Parliament really been independent the\r\nPenal Laws would have in time been abolished entirely. But the vigilance\r\nof English policy and English Ministers never ceased; their meddling in\r\nthe affairs of Ireland was perpetual and mischievous: the rights of the\r\nIrish Parliament were constantly in danger from the interference of\r\nEnglish Ministers who advised their common Monarch and moulded his Irish\r\npolicy through the Viceroy and the Executive. It was but a step from the\r\nadmission of Catholics to the franchise to their admission to the House of\r\nCommons, but that step was never taken by the Irish Parliament. The\r\nmeasures of Parliamentary reform pressed upon them by the popular party\r\nboth inside and outside Parliament were constantly rejected, partly\r\nthrough the mere conservatism of privilege partly through the influence of\r\nthe English Cabinet. The United Irishmen, whose aim was to establish a\r\nfree and equal representation of all Irishmen irrespective of creed,\r\ndespaired of obtaining their object by open agitation and, subjected to\r\nrepressive enactments, transformed themselves into a secret association\r\nfor the overthrow of the existing government and for complete separation\r\nfrom England as the only method of securing and maintaining the rights of\r\nIreland. They were the first Irish Republican Party. They appealed for\r\nassistance to the French Directory, but so jealous were they of their\r\nindependence that they seem to have jeopardized the prospect of help by\r\ntheir insistence that the force sent must not be large enough to threaten\r\nthe subjugation of the country. The Government, becoming aware of the\r\nconspiracy, took steps at once to foster it and to crush it. Their agents\r\nwent through the country, forming United Irish lodges and then denouncing\r\nthe members to the authorities. Under pretence of helping the Irish\r\nGovernment in its difficulties. English regiments were poured into the\r\ncountry and, when a sufficient force was assembled, open rebellion was\r\nprovoked and crushed with a systematic barbarity which is even now hardly\r\ncredible.\r\n\r\nTo understand the Rebellion and the policy of the Union which followed it,\r\none must go farther back than the last quarter of the eighteenth century.\r\nThe fall of Limerick ended (or seemed to end) the struggle for the\r\nmilitary domination of Ireland. Once it was in the effective possession of\r\nEngland the period of its commercial subjugation began. Every kind of\r\nmanufacture which competed with that of England was suppressed: every\r\nbranch of commerce which threatened rivalry with that of England was\r\nforbidden. To ensure at once that military resistance might not be renewed\r\nand that commercial subjugation might be endured the policy was adopted\r\nfirst (to quote Archbishop Boulter) of \"filling the great places with\r\nnatives of England\" and secondly of perpetuating the animosity between\r\nProtestants and Catholics. It was hoped in this way to form \"two nations\"\r\nout of one and render the task of government and exploitation easier in\r\nconsequence. The remarkable power of absorbing foreign settlers shown by\r\nthe Irish Nation since before the Conquest was thus to be nullified and\r\nreligion pressed into service against humanity. So clearly was this policy\r\nconceived that Archbishop Boulter could write \"The worst of this is that\r\nit tends to unite Protestant with Papist and, whenever that happens,\r\ngood-bye to the English interests in Ireland forever.\" But the agents of\r\nthe policy overreached themselves. Irish Protestants turned against a\r\npolicy which counted the merit of being a Protestant as less than the\r\ndemerit of being Irish. Dean Swift won the favour alike of Irish\r\nProtestant and Irish Catholic by his mordant pamphlets against the English\r\npolicy in Ireland and may justly be reckoned as on the whole the most\r\npowerful champion of Irish independence in the sense of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. The Irish agents of the policy of Protestant Ascendancy\r\noverreached themselves too. Official Irish Protestantism bore almost as\r\nhardly upon Presbyterians as upon Papists, and the United Irishmen at the\r\nend of the century found no support in Ireland warmer than that accorded\r\nthem by the best of the Ulster Presbyterians. There is little doubt that\r\nthe reversal of the commercial ascendancy by the legislation of 1782 was\r\nregarded by the English Ministry as a merely temporary setback, to be\r\nrepaired at the earliest convenient opportunity. In any case the valuable\r\nasset of Protestant Ascendancy, with its possibilities of perpetual\r\nfriction and disunion among Irishmen, was still in their hands. When the\r\nrise of the United Irishmen threatened even this, the necessity of\r\nrecovering the lost ground and the opportunity of doing so were\r\nimmediately recognised. The obstinacy with which the Irish Parliament\r\nopposed Parliamentary reform (an obstinacy directly fostered by the\r\npolicy of the English Ministry) drove the United Irish movement into\r\nhostility at once to the English connection and to the existing\r\nconstitution of Ireland. They could thus be represented as at once a\r\nmenace to England and a menace to Ireland, and it was held to be the duty\r\nof both Governments to combine to crush them. They were crushed by English\r\ntroops, but the Irish Parliament was crushed with them. Pitt decided that\r\ndirect control by the English Ministry must take the place of indirect\r\ncontrol through an Irish Executive, and the Legislative Union was enacted.\r\nThere seemed to be no other permanent or ultimate alternative to the\r\ncomplete independence and separation of England and Ireland.\r\n\r\nMuch impressive rhetoric has been expended upon the measures taken to\r\nsecure that the members of the Irish Parliament should produce a majority\r\nin favour of the Act of Union. They were bribed and intimidated; they were\r\noffered posts and pensions: some of them were bought with hard cash. But\r\neven a Castlereagh must have been aware that if he should suborn a servant\r\nto betray his master the gravamen of the charge against him would not be\r\nthat he had corrupted the morals of the servant by offering him a bribe.\r\nOrdinary morality may not apply to politics, but if it does, Pitt and\r\nCastlereagh were guilty of a far greater crime than that of bribing a few\r\nscores of venal Irishmen; and the members of the Irish Parliament who took\r\ntheir money were guilty not of corruption but of treason. For the Act of\r\nUnion was intended to accomplish the destruction of the national\r\nexistence. The members of Parliament who voted against it, knew this: the\r\nIrish people who petitioned against it, knew this: Pitt and Castlereagh\r\nknew it: the men they paid to vote for it, knew it too.\r\n\r\nThe politics of Ireland during the nineteenth century would have been\r\ntangled enough at the best, but the Act of Union introduced a confusion\r\nwhich has often seemed to make the situation inexplicable to a normal\r\nmind. But, to leave details aside, the main lines of the problem are clear\r\nenough. The Act of Union was designed to end the separate national\r\nexistence of Ireland by incorporating its legislative and administrative\r\nmachinery with that of England. To secure control to the \"Predominant\r\nPartner\" (as the incorporating body has since been called) the\r\nrepresentation of Ireland in the Imperial Parliament was fixed at a total\r\nwhich at the time of the Act was less than half that to which it was\r\nentitled on the basis of the population. While the intention of the\r\nauthors of the measure (as their published correspondence makes perfectly\r\nclear) was to subordinate Irish national interests to those of England,\r\nthe measure was presented to Parliament as one designed to further the\r\nmutual interests of the two kingdoms. But to Protestant waverers it was\r\ncommended in private as a necessary means of securing the Protestant\r\ninterest, while to the Catholics hopes were held out that the removal of\r\nthe Catholic disabilities maintained by the Protestant ascendancy in\r\nIreland might be hoped for from the more liberal Parliament in England.\r\nThere is no doubt that many Catholics, especially among the nobility and\r\nhigher clergy, were induced at least to discourage resistance to the\r\nmeasure, partly for this reason, partly out of fear of the republican\r\nsympathies and aims of the reforming United Irishmen. The extreme\r\nProtestants, such as the Orangemen who helped to suppress the rebellion,\r\nviewed the measure with a certain suspicion, if not with definite\r\nhostility. They looked forward, now that the rebellion was crushed, to a\r\nprolonged tenure of unchallenged ascendancy. But the bulk of the more\r\nliberal Protestants were against it, and the wiser Catholics. They\r\nforetold the ruin of trade, the burden of increased taxation, the loss of\r\nall real independence and freedom that were bound to, and did, result. But\r\nthey were neither consulted nor listened to and the measure was passed\r\nafter free speech had been bought over in Parliament and suppressed by\r\nmilitary force outside.\r\n\r\nThe measure once passed brought about an unnatural shifting of parties in\r\nIreland. Many of those who had opposed the measure before it became law,\r\nnow decided to make the best of what could no longer be prevented. The\r\norators of the Patriot Party passed over to the English Parliament and\r\nwere practically lost to Ireland. The aristocracy who had upheld the Irish\r\nParliament gravitated towards the new seat of Government and abandoned a\r\ncapital deserted by the Parliament of their pride. They sent their\r\nchildren to be educated in England, and in the second generation they\r\nbegan to call themselves not Irishmen but Englishmen. The representatives\r\nof both these parties became in time convinced upholders of the Union and\r\ntheir influence in Ireland was thrown in favour of the maintenance of the\r\n_status quo_. To this \"Unionist\" party must be added the Orange party who\r\nstood for Protestant ascendancy. Much as they disliked the Union to begin\r\nwith they came to see in the end that, unaided, they could not stand for\r\nlong against the claim of their Catholic fellow-countrymen for political\r\nequality. The one thing that reconciled them to the Union was its\r\npossibilities in securing the Protestant interest. To this attitude they\r\nhave remained faithful ever since, and in the course of the century they\r\nwere joined by the majority of the Protestants of Ireland. Ulster, at one\r\ntime the chief strength of the United Irishmen, became the headquarters of\r\nextreme and even fanatical support of the Union. Here \"the Protestant\r\ninterest,\" carefully fostered as an instrument of English influence in\r\nIreland, founded its citadel, the rallying point of opposition to \"Irish\"\r\nclaims. After Connaught, the most definitely \"Celtic\" portion of Ireland\r\n(in spite of the Ulster Plantations), its extreme Protestant sympathies,\r\ncarefully fostered by the Protestant clergy into a bigotry that has become\r\ngrotesque, converted the dominions of the O'Neills and the O'Donnells into\r\na desperate and apparently irreconcilable antagonist of Irish national\r\ninterests. Besides, Ulster suffered less than the rest of Ireland from the\r\neconomic effects of the Union. Though the population of Ulster has been\r\nalmost halved as the result of it, the \"Ulster custom\" saved the tenants\r\nfrom some of the worst abuses of the land system of the other provinces,\r\nand the prosperity of the linen trade, never endangered by collision with\r\nEnglish interests, did not suffer by the measure; while the greater wealth\r\nof the manufacturing districts made the burden of unfair taxation (which\r\nrepressed commercial and industrial enterprise in the rest of Ireland)\r\nless felt than it might have been. A mistaken view of their own interests,\r\nand an equally mistaken view of the real aims of the rest of their\r\ncountrymen (a mistake sometimes encouraged by the tactics of their\r\nopponents) converted Protestant Ulster into an attitude which ignorance\r\nhas represented as a consciousness of a racial difference between itself\r\nand the rest of Ireland. But even in Ulster there still remain many\r\nProtestant Irishmen to whom the recollection of the days of the United\r\nIrishmen is like the recollection of the Golden Age. Still faithful to the\r\ndoctrines of equality, fraternity and freedom they are the last links of\r\nthe chain which once bound Ulster to the cause of Ireland.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand Catholic Ireland as a whole, and especially its leaders,\r\necclesiastical and other, viewed the enactment of the legislative Union\r\nwith a kind of apathetic despair. Nothing apparently was to be hoped from\r\nthe Irish Parliament in the direction of real religious equality or\r\nreform of the franchise: nothing more could be expected from armed\r\nresistance after the signal failure of the rebellion. The country was\r\noccupied by an English army and, whatever they thought, they must think in\r\nsilence. Hopes were held out that the Union might bring Catholic\r\nEmancipation, that the Catholic clergy might receive a State subsidy\r\nsimilar to that given to the Presbyterian ministers. They were to find\r\nthat Catholic Emancipation was no more to the taste of England than to\r\nthat of the Irish Parliament and that a State subsidy to the Catholic\r\nChurch would only be granted at the price which Castlereagh desired the\r\nPresbyterian ministers to pay for the _Regium Donum_. But for the moment\r\nthey did nothing and there was nothing that could be done. Entitled to\r\nvote but not to sit in Parliament, but half-emancipated from the bondage,\r\nmaterial and moral, of the Penal Laws, they had no effective weapon at\r\ntheir disposal within the constitution, and the only other weapon that\r\nthey had had broken in their hands. They were forced into a position of\r\nsilent and half-hearted protest, and have ever since been at the\r\ndisadvantage of having to appear as the disturbers of the existing order.\r\nThe hopes held out by the promoters of the Union were not realized without\r\nprolonged and violent agitation, and the cause of Ireland appeared doubly\r\nalien, clothed in the garb of a Church alien to the legislators to whom\r\nappeal was made. That the national cause was first identified with the\r\nclaims of Irish Catholics to religious equality is the _damnosa hereditas_\r\nof Irish Nationalism in the nineteenth century. The music of \"the Pope's\r\nBrass Band\" drowns the voice of orator and poet. The demand that the\r\nnation as a whole should no longer be compelled to support the\r\nestablishment of the Church of a minority was represented as a move on the\r\npart of the Roman Curia to cripple Protestantism in the United Kingdom.\r\nThe demand for the reform of the worst land system in Europe was looked\r\nupon as a resistance to the constitution inspired by the agents of the\r\nVatican. The Irish people asks for nothing, but the Pope or the Irish\r\nCatholic hierarchy, working in darkness, is supposed to have put it into\r\ntheir heads, though the Irish people have taught both Pope and Bishops\r\nmany lessons upon the distinction between religious authority and\r\npolitical dictation.\r\n\r\nThus there gradually developed during the nineteenth century the Unionist\r\nand the Nationalist parties, the former upholding the legislative Union\r\nthough not averse (upon pressure) to the concession of administrative\r\nreforms: the latter under many forms claiming in greater or lesser measure\r\nthe abolition of the _fons et origo malorum_, the withdrawal from the\r\npeople of Ireland of the right to an independent legislature. The historic\r\nclaim to complete independence has on many occasions been modified in\r\ntheory or abated in practice by the National leaders: but a survey of the\r\nhistory of Ireland since the Union shows that, with whatever apparent\r\nabatements or disguises the claim may have been pressed, there has always\r\nbeen deep down the feeling that behind the Union lay the Conquest, the\r\nhope that to repeal the one meant a step upon the road to annul the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIRISH NATIONALISM IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe political history of Post-Union Ireland opens with an armed rebellion.\r\nRobert Emmet for an abortive attempt to seize Dublin Castle was condemned\r\nand executed in 1803. His rising was the last effort of the United\r\nIrishmen. Since the Union, and for more than a century after his death,\r\nthe country was governed under a species of martial law, and Coercion Acts\r\nwere matters of almost annual enactment. The Government could not count on\r\nthe steady loyalty of any class of the community. The Orange societies\r\nrequired to be placated, the Presbyterians to be muzzled, the Catholics to\r\nbe suppressed. Castlereagh's administration was a frank recognition of the\r\nfact that Irishmen as a body were hostile to the Union, and that any means\r\nmight be employed to keep them quiet. For more than twenty years the\r\nCatholics waited in vain for the fulfilment of the hopes of emancipation\r\nheld out at the time of the Union. Meanwhile \"the bonds of Empire\"\r\ncontinued to be drawn tighter and tighter. In 1817 the Irish Exchequer,\r\nthe belated relic of Ireland's independent existence, was amalgamated with\r\nthat of England, and the long history of the financial oppression of the\r\ncountry began. At last in 1823 Catholic Ireland began the public\r\nagitation of its claims for civil equality with Irish Protestants. The\r\nagitation, justifiable and necessary in itself, natural and dignified had\r\nit taken place in an independent Ireland and had it been of the nature of\r\nan appeal to the justice of their fellow-countrymen, assumed the\r\ninevitable form of an appeal to a foreign legislature for a justice denied\r\nthem at home. The Catholic Association founded in 1760 was revived by\r\nDaniel O'Connell and in six years' time, so strong was the feeling\r\naroused, the English Government yielded, for fear (as the Duke of\r\nWellington confessed) of a civil war. O'Connell had talked as if he were\r\nready for anything and the Duke of Wellington seems to have thought that\r\nhe meant what he said. It was the first victory for \"moral force\" and\r\nO'Connell became enamoured of the new weapon. Next year the Tithe War\r\nbroke out and ended in 1838 in an incomplete victory, the Tithes, instead\r\nof being abolished, being paid henceforth in money as an addition to the\r\nrent. But before the Tithe War ended, O'Connell (now member for Clare in\r\nthe Imperial Parliament) had founded the Constitutional Party by giving\r\nhis support to Lord Melbourne's Government. For O'Connell's policy there\r\nwas this to be said: that, the Union being an accomplished fact, the only\r\nway to secure legislative benefits for Ireland was through the only means\r\nrecognized by the constitution: that, both English parties being equally\r\nindifferent to the special interests of Ireland, it was sound practical\r\npolicy to secure by an alliance with one or other, as occasion might\r\ndictate, some special claim upon its consideration and (incidentally) some\r\nhope of appointments to Government positions of Irishmen in sympathy with\r\nthe majority in Ireland: that the only alternative was open defiance of\r\nthe Constitution and the sacrifice of what otherwise might be gained by\r\nits recognition. Against his policy it could be urged that to employ\r\nconstitutional forms was to recognize a constitution repugnant to his\r\ndeclared convictions; that appeals to the Parliament of the United Kingdom\r\ntended in practice to intensify Irish divisions and to break up the nation\r\ninto two groups of litigants pleading before a bar which viewed them with\r\nan indifferent disdain; that in any case success in the appeal would be\r\nthe result of accident and circumstance or be dictated by the interests of\r\nEnglish policy. Between these two views of Irish national policy Ireland\r\nhas been divided and has wavered ever since.\r\n\r\nBut O'Connell, having been successful once, seems to have conceived it\r\npossible to be successful always, and he decided to attempt the Repeal of\r\nthe Union. It is hard to suppose that he thought this possible by any\r\nmeans which he was prepared to use. In 1840 he founded the Repeal\r\nAssociation, and in two years' time he had practically the whole of\r\nCatholic Ireland, and a small but enthusiastic body of Protestants, behind\r\nhim. Monster meetings were held all over the country. Repeal Clubs were\r\nfounded, recruits pressed in, \"moral force,\" in the form of threats that\r\n\"he would either be in his grave or a freeman\" within a reasonable time,\r\nwas employed by the leader. But when the Government proclaimed the\r\nmeeting, announced to be held on Sunday, October the 8th, 1843, at\r\nClontarf, chosen as the scene of Brian Boroimhe's crowning victory over\r\nthe Danes, O'Connell yielded at discretion. No reform, as he proclaimed\r\nafterwards, was worth the shedding of a single drop of human blood; and\r\nBrian's battlefield saw the troops wait all day long for the foe that\r\nnever came. Unable to persuade, O'Connell was unprepared to fight, the\r\nenemies of Repeal. But the Repeal Association continued: the Repeal\r\nmembers of Parliament either were (like O'Connell) arrested and imprisoned\r\nor withdrew from Westminster to deliberate in Ireland upon Committees of\r\nthe Repeal Association on matters of national moment. As time went on,\r\nO'Connell (and still more his worthless son, John) gave the Association an\r\never-increasing bias towards sectarianism and away from Nationalism. He\r\nfought the \"Young Ireland\" Party, as Davis, Gavan Duffy, John Mitchel and\r\ntheir associates were called, who carried on the purely national and\r\nliberal traditions of the United Irishmen, and finally forced them to\r\nsecede. Their paper _The Nation_, founded in 1842, was until its\r\nsuppression the mouthpiece of the liberal and really National Party. It\r\nvoiced in impassioned prose and verse the aspirations of the historic\r\nIrish nation. Its guiding spirit, Thomas Davis, was a member of a\r\nProtestant family in Mallow, and its contributors comprised men of all\r\ncreeds, Irish and Anglo-Irish, who looked forward to the revival of Irish\r\nculture, of the Irish language and of an Irish polity in which room would\r\nbe found for all sons and daughters of Ireland, free to develop as one of\r\nthe family of European nations, released from all outside interference in\r\nnational concerns. But Irish divisions, fostered by the Union, fomented by\r\nstatecraft and furthered by many Irishmen, grew steadily more pronounced.\r\nThomas Davis and his friends, at the risk of misunderstanding and\r\nmisrepresentation, did their utmost to promote union on the basis of a\r\ncommon pride in Ireland's past and a common hope for Ireland's future. The\r\nCommittees of the Repeal Association worked hard at reports upon Irish\r\nneeds and Irish conditions. They promoted the composition and publication\r\nof Repeal Essays pointing to the results of the Union in diminishing\r\nmanufactures and in an impoverished national life. They had a temporary\r\nsuccess, and their writings were destined to supply inspiration to their\r\nsuccessors, but they were battling with a running tide. The moderate\r\npeople, tired of the struggle, were finding in Federalism a resting place\r\nbetween conviction and expediency or had made up their minds to accept the\r\nUnion. The gradual process of Anglicization went on apace. The\r\nestablishment in 1831 of the Board of National Education under the joint\r\nmanagement of Catholic, Protestant and Presbyterian dignitaries was, in\r\nspite of much opposition, making sure headway. It was destined to destroy\r\nfor all practical purposes the Gaelic language which till then had been in\r\ncommon use in all parts of Ireland. It proscribed Irish history and Irish\r\npatriotic poetry in its schools. It was seized upon by ecclesiastics of\r\nall persuasions and made, in the name of religion, a potent instrument of\r\na policy of internal division and mistrust. It placed education, with all\r\nits possibilities of national culture and national union, in the hands of\r\na Board definitely anti-national in its outlook, working through\r\ninstruments to whom sectarian prejudices meant more than national welfare.\r\nHad Davis lived he might have done much with his great gifts, his tolerant\r\nspirit and his heroic temper: his death in 1845 was one of the greatest\r\nlosses which Ireland suffered during the nineteenth century. O'Connell,\r\nwhose later activities had been almost wholly mischievous, died two years\r\nlater just as the full horror of the Famine burst upon the country. The\r\nGovernment which had assumed responsibility for the interests of Ireland,\r\nmet this awful visitation with an ineptitude so callous as almost to\r\njustify John Mitchel's fiercest denunciations. While the crops were being\r\nexported from the country over 700,000 persons died of starvation and as\r\nmany again by famine fever. When the fever and famine had done their work,\r\nthe clearances began. The population fled from the country where there was\r\nnothing left for them or, if they did not fly, they were shipped off by\r\nthe landlords to leave room for the development of grazing farms. From\r\n1846 to 1851, one million and a quarter of the population \"emigrated,\" and\r\nin the next nine years they were followed, thanks to the same causes, by\r\nanother million and a half. During the same period 373,000 families were\r\nevicted from their holdings to provide room for a handful of graziers.\r\n\r\nThe Famine and its consequences seemed a final proof of the failure of the\r\nEnglish Government to preserve the elementary interests of Ireland, and a\r\nsection of the Young Irelanders could see no other remedy than an appeal\r\nto force, if they were to regain independence and keep Ireland from\r\ndestruction. John Mitchel seceded from _The Nation_ and founded _The\r\nUnited Irishman_, in which week after week with extraordinary eloquence\r\nand courage he advocated the policy of resistance. He advised the\r\npeasantry to procure arms, to manufacture pikes, if nothing better could\r\nbe had, to resist the official searches for arms (for a stringent Coercion\r\nAct had been one of the weapons with which the Government combatted the\r\nFamine) and to refuse to allow food to leave the country. He appealed in a\r\nseries of letters to the Protestant farmers of Ulster to help Ireland as\r\nthey had helped before in the days of the United Irishmen. Had all the\r\nleaders of the Young Ireland Party possessed the spirit of Mitchel, and\r\nhad any of them known how to organize a rebellion, they would not have\r\nlacked a very formidable following. But Mitchel was arrested, sentenced\r\nand transported before anything was done and the actual outbreak under\r\nSmith O'Brien and Meagher was doomed to failure from the outset.\r\n\r\nMitchel had advanced far beyond \"moral force\" and the Repeal of the Union.\r\nHe had definitely renounced the idea of arguing the Union out of\r\nexistence: he regarded no policy as either practicable or manly which did\r\nnot begin and end in the assertion that Ireland was a free country and was\r\nprepared to adopt any and every means to put her freedom into practice.\r\nLike all the Young Irelanders, he had begun his political life as a\r\nRepealer and a follower of O'Connell; he had appealed to the Irish gentry\r\nto act again as they had acted in 1782. But Irish history since the Union\r\nand especially the experiences of the Famine years (there had been several\r\npartial famines before 1846) was making some serious thinkers very\r\nsceptical of a political solution which left one of the main factors of\r\npolitics out of account. The man who saw the defects of the Repeal\r\nsolution and exposed them most trenchantly and convincingly was James\r\nFintan Lalor. In a series of letters and articles written for _The Nation_\r\nand for the _Irish Felon_ he expounded a theory of nationality which went\r\nto the very roots of political facts. His policy was not Repeal; \"I will\r\nnever,\" he said, \"contribute one shilling or give my name, heart, or hand,\r\nfor such an object as the simple repeal by the British Parliament of the\r\nAct of Union.\" The facts of everyday life in Ireland showed that a new\r\nsocial system was required, the old having had its day. \"There was no\r\noutrise or revolt against it. It was not broken up by violence. It was\r\nborne for ages with beggarly patience, until it perished by the irritation\r\nof God in the order of nature.\" So long as a system remained in which the\r\nland of Ireland was not in possession of the people of Ireland, no repeal\r\nor other measure purely political would avail. If the landlords were to\r\nremain (and Lalor had no desire to expel them if they were willing to\r\nsubmit to the paramount right of the nation) they must accept their titles\r\nto whatever rights should be theirs from the Irish nation and the Irish\r\nnation only. \"The principle I state, and mean to stand upon, is this\" (he\r\nwrote) \"that the entire ownership of Ireland, moral and material, up to\r\nthe sun and down to the centre, is vested of right in the people of\r\nIreland; that they, and none but they, are the landowners and lawmakers of\r\nthis island; that all laws are null and void not, made by them, and all\r\ntitles to land invalid not conferred and confirmed by them; and that this\r\nfull right of ownership may and ought to be asserted and enforced by any\r\nand all means which God has put in the power of man.\" The coming of the\r\nlean years culminating in the Famine had taught Lalor the overwhelming\r\nimportance of the question: \"A revolution is beginning to begin which will\r\nleave Ireland _without a people_ unless it be met and conquered by a\r\nrevolution which will leave it without landlords.\" Failure to observe (or\r\nto see the importance of) the land question had led to the defeat of\r\nMitchel and Smith O'Brien. \"They wanted an alliance with the landowners.\r\nThey chose to consider them as Irishmen, and imagined they could induce\r\nthem to hoist the green flag. They wished to preserve an Aristocracy. They\r\ndesired, not a democratic, but merely a national revolution. Who imputes\r\nblame to them for this? Whoever does so will not have me to join him. I\r\nhave no feeling but one of respect for the motives that caused reluctance\r\nand delay. That delay, however, I consider as a matter of deep regret. Had\r\nthe Confederation, in the May or June of '47, thrown heart and mind and\r\nmeans and might into the movement I pointed out, they would have made it\r\nsuccessful, and settled at once and for ever all quarrels and questions\r\nbetween us and England.\" But though Lalor insisted on the importance of\r\nthe question of the ownership of the soil and confessed complete\r\nindifference to Repeal, an indifference which he claimed was largely\r\nshared by the people of Ireland (for Repeal, as he said, the Irish wolf\r\ndog \"will never bite, but only bark\") he was a land reformer, not out of a\r\nlack of interest in political questions, but out of an intense belief in\r\nthe realities of politics. He never joined the Repealers, partly because\r\nO'Connell and his following disgusted him; as he says in a letter to Gavan\r\nDuffy: \"Before I embarked in the boat I looked at the crew and the\r\ncommander; the same boat which you and others mistook in '43 for a war\r\nfrigate because she hoisted gaudy colours and that her captain swore\r\nterribly. I knew her at once for a leaky collier-smack, with a craven\r\ncrew to man her, and a sworn dastard and a foresworn traitor at the\r\nhelm--a fact which you and Young Ireland would seem never to have\r\ndiscovered until he ordered the boat to be stranded and yourselves to be\r\nset ashore.\" This language may be unnecessarily vigorous and hurtful but\r\nthe judgment is not essentially unjust. But it was not merely disgust\r\nwhich kept Lalor out of the Repeal ranks. He disbelieved utterly in the\r\nRepeal of the Union as a solution for the Irish question. It was in the\r\nfirst place impracticable. \"You will _NEVER_, in form of law, repeal the\r\nAct of Union. _Never_, while the sun sits in heaven, and the laws of\r\nnature are in action. _Never_, before night goes down on the last day.\"\r\nWhat was, however, practicable was to claim the land, refuse to pay rent\r\nfor it, and institute a protracted, obstinate and violent resistance to\r\nthe attempt on the part of English troops to take it back again. Once the\r\nland was again in the possession of the people of Ireland their ultimate\r\npolicy would be clear. \"Not the repeal of the Union, then, but the\r\nConquest--not to disturb or dismantle the Empire, but to abolish it\r\nutterly for ever--not to fall back on '82 but act up to '48--not to resume\r\nor restore an old constitution, but found a new nation and raise up a free\r\npeople, and strong as well as free, and secure as well as strong, based on\r\na peasantry rooted like rocks in the soil of the land--this is my object.\"\r\n\"Not the constitution that Wolfe Tone died to abolish, but the\r\nconstitution that Wolfe Tone died to obtain--independence; full and\r\nabsolute independence for this island, and for every man within this\r\nisland.\" Lalor knew well enough that this meant fighting in the long run,\r\nbut he thought that it was worth fighting for while Repeal of the Union\r\nwas not: but who was to lead the fight? Little was to be looked for from\r\nthe Repeal leaders, content with \"a small Dublin reputation,\" with neither\r\nthe desire nor the talents to lead a nation. His last article in the\r\n_Irish Felon_, written while Smith O'Brien and Meagher were in prison, is\r\nan impassioned appeal for someone to lead a nation that was only waiting\r\nfor a man. \"Remember this--that somewhere and somehow and by somebody, a\r\nbeginning must be made. Who strikes the first blow for Ireland? Who draws\r\nfirst blood for Ireland? Who wins a wreath that will be green for ever?\"\r\n\r\nThe _perenni fronde corona_ which Lalor promised has not yet been won and\r\nmay never be won by the means which Lalor thought of, but the influence of\r\nhis writings upon later Irish political thought has been profound. The\r\nRepeal Movement brought out three men of real genius--Davis, Mitchel and\r\nLalor. Davis was always more than a simple Repealer; his mind took in too\r\ngreat a range, his knowledge was too wide, his commonsense too great, to\r\nsee in Repeal of the Union the ultimate end of Irish political endeavour.\r\nMitchel abandoned Repeal for Revolution in hot blood and out of a haughty\r\nheart. Lalor had the cool head and the keen eye and the sense of reality\r\nwhich Mitchel lacked; but though he wrote less and did less and suffered\r\nless, what he lost in immediate reputation he gained in his influence over\r\na later age and in a wider field.\r\n\r\nThe situation of Ireland in the years immediately following the Famine was\r\ntragic. On the one side was starvation, impotence, despair. The starvation\r\nmight have been, and in any normally governed country would have been,\r\naverted: but Ireland was in the unnatural position of being governed by\r\noutsiders who had absolutely no interest in the country beyond that of\r\nensuring that it should not govern itself: seeing the remedy for its\r\nmisery, but unable to employ it, in the face of an army which not all the\r\nfiery eloquence of Mitchel and Meagher could persuade the starving people\r\nwas capable of being defeated by a mob of pikemen, Ireland sank back into\r\nan apathetic and moody despair from which it took many years to recover,\r\nduring which the life of the nation almost drained away. On the other side\r\nwas the Government, indifferent to the misery of its victim, determined\r\nthat nothing, not even the extinction of the race, should alter the fixed\r\nresolve of England to be absolute and sole master in Ireland. The failure\r\nof the Rebellion of '48 was not to the rulers of England a matter\r\naltogether of congratulation. A highly-placed personage, able to gauge\r\nwith accuracy the sentiment of the English ruling classes, wrote: \"There\r\nare ample means of crushing the rebellion in Ireland and I think it is now\r\nvery likely to go off without any contest, which people (and I think with\r\nright) rather regret. The Irish should receive a good lesson or they will\r\nbegin again.\" The awful mortality from famine and pestilence was regarded\r\nwith a kind of chastened and reverential gratitude, as an unexpected\r\ninterference of Providence for the extirpation of the hated race. In the\r\nthen temper of England no revolution had the least chance of sympathy or\r\nsuccess. It would have been crushed, whatever the cost.\r\n\r\nBut though prostrate, despairing and depleted Ireland still claimed her\r\nrights, though for a few years it seemed as if they had been tacitly\r\nwaived. The Repeal agitation died, and its place was taken by the Irish\r\nTenant League which aimed not at interference with constitutional\r\narrangements but at the solution of the land question, not in the radical\r\nmethod advocated by Lalor but by legislation securing certain rights to\r\nthe tenant, the claim of the landlord to be owner of the land being left\r\nuntouched. Lalor had foretold that on the land question Ulster instead of\r\nbeing \"on the flank\" of the rest of Ireland would march with it side by\r\nside: and Gavan Duffy in his League of the North and South went some\r\nlength in the way of securing the co-operation of the Northern Tenant\r\nRighters. At the same time the Irish representatives in Parliament formed\r\nthe beginning of an Independent Parliamentary Party, holding aloof from\r\nany binding alliance with either English Party but combining at need with\r\nthe party most favourable at the moment to Irish claims. But the new\r\npolicy proved a failure within three years, partly by the treachery of\r\nmembers of the party, but chiefly through the inherent hopelessness of the\r\nposition of any Irish party then in Parliament. Besides, the Tenant League\r\nhad to contend with the masterful personality of Cardinal Cullen, an\r\necclesiastic of the Ultramontane School, who spent his life in the\r\nendeavour, temporarily successful, to throw the whole weight of his Church\r\nagainst the just claims of the nation.\r\n\r\nDuring the abortive attempt at a constitutional policy, the survivors of\r\nthe party of Mitchel and Lalor were not idle. It cannot be said that\r\nIreland had at this time come to recognize the futility of parliamentary\r\nagitation, for it cannot be said to have given it a sufficient trial: but\r\nthe results of it had so far been disappointing, and the tradition of\r\nindependence was still fresh, and its spirit strong. The new form which\r\nwas assumed by the Separatist movement after the failure of '48 was that\r\nknown as the Fenian Society, or the Irish Republican Brotherhood. Its\r\nchief organizers, James Stephens, John O'Mahony, John O'Leary and Thos.\r\nClarke Luby had all been \"out\" in '48. Stephens and O'Mahony had lived in\r\nParis till 1850; Stephens then returned to Ireland, gaining his living as\r\na teacher of French, while O'Mahony went to New York. Both in Ireland and\r\nNew York the teaching of the two friends found ready listeners, and an\r\namazing success. The Irish in America were only too ready to return to\r\nIreland to overthrow the Government in whose authority they saw the source\r\nof their country's misfortunes and their own exile. On the conclusion of\r\nthe American War thousands of Irishmen who had fought under Grant or\r\nJackson were ready to place their services at the disposal of an Irish\r\nleader. But they found no one of sufficient ability and prestige to lead\r\nthem. Smith O'Brien and the other survivors of the Young Ireland Party had\r\nbecome constitutionalists. John Mitchel, though he went to Paris to act as\r\ntreasurer for the Society, refused to take any more active part. O'Mahony\r\nand the Americans wanted to equip and despatch an expedition: James\r\nStephens, who had undertaken to organize the movement in Ireland, insisted\r\nthat American assistance should be confined to money. The money came in\r\nslowly and though Stephens could enrol a revolutionary army he could not\r\nequip it. The Americans too wanted the rising to take place before\r\nStephens thought the time was ripe, and the consequent quarrel between the\r\nIrish and American leaders was fatal to the chance of success. In any case\r\nlittle real progress was made until the year 1865, but the work of\r\npreparation went steadily on. The organization in Ireland, which at first\r\nwas without a name, the oath of membership being merely an oath of\r\nallegiance to the Irish Republic, was formally inaugurated on St.\r\nPatrick's Day, 1858. In 1859 the Government, becoming alarmed, broke up\r\nthe Phoenix Society of Skibbereen, an independent organization, and the\r\nmembers later on joined the Fenians. All the forces of the Church and the\r\ninfluence of such recognized leaders as were left were arrayed against\r\nthe new organization. Fenians were refused the rites of the Church for\r\nbeing members of a secret oath-bound society, and at least one member has\r\nleft upon record that having to choose between Faith and Country he chose\r\nCountry. The Fenians boldly defied Cardinal Cullen and his clerical\r\nagents. The _Irish People_, founded in 1862 under John O'Leary as editor,\r\ntook up the Cardinal's challenge and faced consistently and courageously\r\nthe question of \"the priest in politics.\" It did incalculable service to\r\nthe Fenians by its courage and frankness. In the same year Belfast and\r\nUlster were brought within the Fenian Circle. By 1865 there were, it was\r\nclaimed, 13,000 sworn Fenians in the army, rather more in the militia, and\r\na good many of the police had joined as well. Stephens judged it time to\r\nprepare for action, but his despatches to the country ordering\r\npreparations to begin fell into the hands of the police. The office of the\r\n_Irish People_ was seized, Habeas Corpus was suspended and the jails were\r\nfilled. Stephens himself was arrested some weeks afterwards. After his\r\nescape from Richmond Prison he lay hid for three months in Ireland and\r\nthen escaped to France and America. Whether better fortune would have\r\ncrowned his work if he had gone on in spite of the arrests is a nice\r\nquestion. Some at any rate of his followers judged that he had missed his\r\nchance. The subsequent attempt in '67 under American leaders fared no\r\nbetter; and General Massey, arrested at Limerick Junction, judged it\r\nbetter to avoid bloodshed by giving full information to the Government.\r\n\r\nThe Fenian Movement, as it was called, was both in Ireland and America\r\navowedly republican and separatist from the very first. Stephens wished to\r\nestablish one form of government only--an Irish Republic, and he believed\r\nin only one method--that of armed revolution. He refused steadily to have\r\nanything to do with tenant rights or parliamentary parties or tactics.\r\n\r\nThe avowed object of the Republican Brotherhood had failed, but it brought\r\nabout two measures of Irish reform, long agitated and overdue, but\r\nneglected until the events of '65 and '67 brought home to a disdainful\r\nParliament the realities of the abuses and of the feelings which their\r\ncontinuance had aroused. The Irish Church Act and Mr. Gladstone's first\r\nLand Bill were due to the Fenians. They were not formally concessions to\r\nFenianism, as the Fenians were concerned first of all to establish a\r\nRepublic and then to decide upon reforms for themselves; the Government\r\nmerely supposed that by mending two intolerable abuses they could cut the\r\nground from under the revolutionary movement. This policy could be only\r\npartially successful: but it succeeded so far that for a period of thirty\r\nyears there was no Irish party that openly and consistently proclaimed its\r\nadhesion to the doctrine of complete separation.\r\n\r\nThe Home Rule policy put forward by Isaac Butt in 1870 fell far short even\r\nof O'Connell's Repeal. Its object was to set up, not an independent, but\r\na strictly subordinate, Parliament in Dublin: the effect of this proposal\r\n(whatever its authors may have intended) would have been to consolidate\r\nthe Union by removing opportunities of friction and of discontent. But\r\neven the appearance of a reversal of the policy of the Union was\r\ndistasteful to Parliament; and the Irish members exhausted themselves in\r\nproviding an annual exhibition of eloquence and passion for the\r\ndelectation of a languid or tolerant audience. The pathetic and\r\nhumiliating performance was ended by the appearance of Charles Stewart\r\nParnell who infused into the forms of Parliamentary action the sacred fury\r\nof battle. He determined that Ireland, refused the right of managing her\r\nown destinies, should at least hamper the English in the government of\r\ntheir own house: he struck at the dignity of Parliament and wounded the\r\nsusceptibilities of Englishmen by his assault upon the institution of\r\nwhich they are most justly proud. His policy of parliamentary obstruction\r\nwent hand in hand with an advanced land agitation at home. The remnant of\r\nthe Fenian Party rallied to his cause and suspended for the time, in his\r\ninterests and in furtherance of his policy, their revolutionary\r\nactivities. For Parnell appealed to them by his honest declaration of his\r\nintentions: he made it plain both to Ireland and to the Irish in America\r\nthat his policy was no mere attempt at a readjustment of details in\r\nAnglo-Irish relations but the first step on the road to national\r\nindependence. He was strong enough both to announce his ultimate\r\nintentions and to define with precision the limit which must be placed\r\nupon the immediate measures to be taken. During the years in which he was\r\nat the head of the National Movement practically all sections of\r\nNationalists acknowledged his leadership and his policy. If he was not\r\nable to control all the extreme elements that grouped themselves under his\r\nbanner it was no more than might have been expected. Neither he nor the\r\nIrish Republican Brotherhood was responsible for the murders perpetrated\r\nby the Invincibles, who had no connection or sympathy with the Fenian\r\npolicy; but their excesses were used, and used with effect, to damage not\r\nonly Parnell's position but the claims of Ireland. It was he himself who\r\ngave to his enemies in the end the only fatal weapon which they could use\r\nagainst him: but the prompt use of it by his own party was a portentous\r\nevent in Irish politics. For the first time the Irish people not alone\r\nconformed to the exigencies of an alliance with an English party, but\r\nallowed that party to veto their choice of a leader. Parnell himself had\r\nonce said \"As the air of London would eat away the stone walls of the\r\nHouse of Commons, so would the atmosphere of the House eat away the honour\r\nand honesty of the Irish members.\" Certainly the tortuous ways of party\r\npolitics had destroyed their loyalty, and though a small band proved\r\nfaithful to him in spite of the Liberal veto, the majority came to a\r\ndecision, practically dictated by the Irish hierarchy and acquiesced in\r\n(even if reluctantly) by a majority of his countrymen, to terminate his\r\nposition as leader. But, though this betrayal seemed to have destroyed the\r\ncause for which he had fought, it may be questioned whether it was really\r\nmore than a symptom of the inherent weakness of his position. The utmost\r\nhe could gain in the direction of Home Rule, the utmost anyone could have\r\ngained under the limitations which he himself imposed upon his policy,\r\nfell markedly short of the minimum which a majority of his followers\r\nthought attainable at once and of what he himself announced to be the\r\nultimate object of his policy. He is remembered, not as the leader who\r\nhelped to force a Liberal Government to produce two Home Rule Bills, but\r\nas the leader who said \"No man can set bounds to the march of a nation.\"\r\n\r\nThe death of Parnell marks the end of an epoch. A strong, romantic and\r\nmysterious personality, he won and kept the affections of the Irish people\r\nin a way which had been possible to few leaders before him and which none\r\nhas attained since. The history of Irish politics for years after his\r\ndeath was a story largely of small intrigue, base personalities, divided\r\ncounsels and despairing expedients; and the policy which eventually\r\nemerged, for which Mr. John Redmond was responsible, was widely removed\r\nfrom that of Parnell. The policy to which Mr. Redmond's adhesion was given\r\nwas that of a Home Rule which might be described as \"Home Rule within the\r\nUnion,\" a Home Rule which in return for a local legislature and internal\r\ncontrol, resigned to the Imperial Parliament all claim to the right to a\r\nforeign policy and to all that would raise Ireland above the level of an\r\ninferior dependency. It is true that Parnell would have obtained little\r\nmore than this, if he had lived; but he would have obtained it in a\r\ndifferent way and would have accepted the concession with a gesture of\r\nindependence. Post-Parnellite Home Rule has been based largely upon the\r\nground that a better understanding between the two countries is desirable\r\nin the interests of both; that government in Ireland is less efficient,\r\nmore costly, less appreciated than it would be if it were administered by\r\nthe people of Ireland themselves, with a due regard to the interests and\r\ngeneral policy of the Empire; its justification is found in the success of\r\nthe self-governing colonies who, thanks to being responsible for their own\r\naffairs, are contented, prosperous and loyal partners in an Imperial\r\nCommonwealth. All this is true, but it is a truth that would have carried\r\nno meaning to the mind of Parnell. To him the British Empire was an\r\nabstraction in which Ireland had no spiritual concern; it formed part of\r\nthe order of the material world in which Ireland found a place; it had,\r\nlike the climatic conditions of Europe, or the Gulf Stream, a real and\r\npreponderating influence on the destinies of Ireland. But the Irish claim\r\nwas to him the claim of a nation to its inherent rights, not the claim of\r\na portion of an empire to its share in the benefits which the constitution\r\nof that empire bestowed upon its more favoured parts. For some years\r\nafter Parnell's death the leaders of the Irish Parliamentary Party felt\r\nobliged to maintain the continuity of tradition by using the language of\r\nthe claim for independence and to speak of \"severing the last link\" which\r\nbound Ireland to England; but even in America and Ireland such expressions\r\nwere heard less and less often from official Nationalists. The final\r\nattitude of the Irish Parliamentary Party is admirably summed up in the\r\nwords of Mr. John Redmond: \"Our demand for Home Rule does not mean that we\r\nwant to break with the British Empire. We are entirely loyal to the Empire\r\nas such and we desire to strengthen the Imperial bonds through a liberal\r\nsystem of government. We do not demand such complete local autonomy as the\r\nBritish self-governing colonies possess, for we are willing to forego the\r\nright to make our own tariffs and are prepared to abide by any fiscal\r\nsystem enacted by the British Parliament.... Once we receive Home Rule we\r\nshall demonstrate our imperial loyalty beyond question.\"\r\n\r\nTen years before these words were used the Sinn Fein movement had begun,\r\nas a protest against the conception of national rights which made such\r\nlanguage possible, as the latest form which the assertion of national\r\nindependence has assumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSINN FEIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the origin of this name as the title of a political party a pleasant\r\ntale is told. It is said that some people, convinced that (in the words of\r\nDavis) \"the freeman's friend is Self-Reliance,\" and wishing to make it the\r\nbasis of a national movement, being anxious for a suitable Irish name for\r\nsuch an idea, applied to a famous Irish scholar to furnish it. He told\r\nthem a story of a country servant in Munster sent with a horse to the\r\nfair. The horse was sold and the servant after some days appeared in his\r\nmaster's kitchen, worn out but happy, and seated himself on the floor. To\r\nthe enquiries of some neighbours who happened to be there, as to where he\r\nhad been and what he had done, he would give no answer but \"Sinn fein sinn\r\nfein.\" The prodigal servant's witty reply eludes the translator. To his\r\nhearers it conveyed that family matters were matters for the family: but\r\nit was no mere evasion of a temporary or personal difficulty. It was the\r\nexpression of a universal truth. Society is divided into groups, large or\r\nsmall, which have their own problems and their own interests. Their\r\nproblems they can best solve themselves, and of their interests they are\r\nthemselves the best judges. The solutions and the judgments will not\r\nalways commend themselves to outsiders; but though outsiders cannot be\r\ndenied the right to hold and to express their opinions they have no\r\nrights of veto or of interference. This right of independence, however, is\r\nsubject in practice to serious limitations, and the history of human\r\nsociety is largely the history of the reconciliation of the competing\r\ninterests and claims of social groups, each claiming to be in the last\r\nresort rightfully independent. One of such groups is the nation, and it is\r\ngenerally recognized that nations as such have rights analogous to those\r\nexercised by other social groups. They may be forcibly deprived by another\r\nand stronger group of rights the exercise of which seems to the stronger\r\nto be inimical to its own interests; or rights may be surrendered in\r\nreturn for what may be judged to be a fair equivalent. But it is not held\r\nthat rights can be extinguished by force or that, if a suitable\r\nopportunity should occur, they may not be regained either by force or by\r\nagreement. These things are generally acknowledged in the abstract; but in\r\nconcrete instances there is seldom an equal unanimity: and a nation whose\r\nrights are in abeyance (especially if it be in the interest of a stronger\r\nneighbour to prevent their exercise) is in a position which seldom admits\r\nof a simple or harmonious solution. Ideally it has a right to complete\r\nindependence: practically it has to be content with as much independence\r\nas it can make good; and the methods which it may employ are various,\r\nalways open to challenge and compassed by uncertainty.\r\n\r\nA nation may maintain its moral and spiritual, long after it has\r\nforfeited its material and political, independence. To such a nation the\r\nmore valuable part of its independence has been preserved. But it is\r\nhardly possible in the long run for a nation which has become materially\r\nand politically dependent upon another to retain its moral and spiritual\r\nindependence unimpaired. The loss of the latter is the final stage in\r\nnational decline.\r\n\r\nTo the founders of Sinn Fein, a national condition was presented to which\r\nno other remedy than their own seemed to offer the prospect of relief. All\r\nprevious efforts to recover the political independence lost by the Act of\r\nUnion had ended in disaster and disappointment. Force had been tried and\r\nproved unavailing: the experiences of '48 and '67 had left little doubt\r\nupon the minds of reasonable men that the attempt to regain Irish\r\nindependence by force of arms was (however heroic) an impossible and\r\nfoolish attempt. \"We believe\" (wrote the chief exponent of Sinn Fein)\r\n\"with the editor of the _Irish World_ that the four-and-a-quarter millions\r\nof unarmed people in Ireland would be no match in the field for the\r\nBritish Empire. If we did not believe so, as firmly as we believe the\r\neighty Irishmen in the British House of Commons are no match for the six\r\nhundred Britishers opposed to them, our proper residence would be a padded\r\ncell.\" But if force of arms had proved useless, so had constitutional\r\nagitation. There was no argument of public justice, public expediency or\r\npublic generosity which had not been urged without effect upon\r\nParliament. Irish members had been arguing against the Union for a hundred\r\nyears: there was no point of view from which the case could be presented\r\nthat had been overlooked. When Parliament seemed to listen and to be\r\nprepared to act it was found not to have heard the arguments for\r\nindependence but arguments for a different kind of a Union. The belief\r\nthat nothing was to be expected from Parliamentary action received later a\r\nstriking confirmation: for when the Irish demand was whittled down to a\r\nbare minimum and all claim to independence expressly renounced, a pretext\r\nwas found in the exigencies of English political relationships for\r\nrefusing even that.\r\n\r\nNot only had political independence gone beyond the chance of recovery by\r\neither force or argument but material independence had followed it. The\r\ntrade, commerce and industries of Ireland which had flourished during its\r\nbrief period of independence had dwindled since the Union and from causes\r\nfor which the Union was directly responsible. The \"equitable proportion\"\r\nof Imperial taxation to which the taxes of Ireland had been restricted by\r\nthe terms of the Act of Union had proved to be inequitable, so that\r\nIreland was overtaxed to the extent of two-and-three-quarter millions of\r\npounds per annum: new taxes in defiance of the Act had been imposed:\r\nIreland, again in defiance of the Act, had been made jointly responsible\r\nfor a debt which was not her own: Irish banks and Irish railways were\r\nmanaged not with reference to Irish interests but in the interests of\r\nEnglish finance and English trade: the Irish mercantile marine was no\r\nmore: the mineral resources of the country in coal and iron remained\r\nundeveloped lest their development might act unfavourably upon vested\r\ninterests in Great Britain. The population had declined at a rate without\r\nparallel in Europe: even Ulster, proclaimed to be prosperous because\r\nProtestant and Unionist, had seen the population of its most \"loyal\"\r\ncounties almost halved in the space of seventy years. Nothing but the\r\nremoval of the cause could arrest this spreading decay, and the cause was\r\ndeclared to be irremovable: to tamper with it was to lay an impious hand\r\nupon the Ark of a grim Covenant.\r\n\r\nBut the last refuge of independence was still safe--resolve was still\r\nstrong--no weakness of acquiescence, no dimness of spirit, no decay of the\r\nsoul was as yet to be discerned. An answer to these questions might be\r\nfound in the history of the language and of what the possession of a\r\nnative language implied. Up to the time of the Union the Gaelic language\r\nhad preserved intact, in spite of Penal Laws and the instruments of\r\nrepression, all that was most vital in the national spirit. Tales of\r\nwarriors and heroes, of the long wars of the Gael with the stranger, the\r\nsighs of love and the aspirations of devotion, satire and encomium, all\r\nthe literature and song of a people were enshrined in the native tongue.\r\nBehind it, as behind an unassailable rampart, the national culture was\r\npreserved, in misery and degradation, it is true, the mere shadow of what\r\nit was and might be, but still its existence was secure. The Irish\r\nlanguage was understood all over Ireland, and was the familiar tongue of\r\nthree-quarters of its inhabitants. It was not a necessary consequence of\r\nthe Union itself that this should be destroyed, but it was a necessary\r\nconsequence of the measures which the Act of Union made it possible to\r\ntake. The English Government decided to embark upon the task of\r\n\"civilizing\" the inhabitants of Ireland by a comprehensive system of\r\npractical education. In 1831 the \"National\" Education system was founded\r\nand before the century was old its work was done: it had \"educated\"\r\nIreland out of its traditional civilization and culture. The authors and\r\nadministrators of this system were sincere and well-intentioned men: they\r\nbelieved that they were removing a disability and conferring a benefit.\r\nThey regarded ignorance as barbarous and disgraceful; and what was\r\nignorance if it was not inability to write, read, and speak the English\r\ntongue? A love of learning had always distinguished the Irish people; and\r\nhere was the learning, for which so many vain sacrifices had been made in\r\nthe past, brought in full measure to their very doors. Everything that\r\nmight induce suspicion of the Danai, _dona ferentes_, was carefully\r\navoided. The Catholic Archbishop of Dublin held a seat on the Board and no\r\nbook was sanctioned by the Board without his unreserved acquiescence. The\r\nCatholic clergy were encouraged to take a share in the administration of\r\nthe schools and to supervise or impart the religious instruction of the\r\npupils. It was the avowed policy of the Board to avoid anything that might\r\nsavour of proselytism on the one hand and of the perpetuation of sectarian\r\ndiscord on the other. Pupils of the two creeds were to meet together on\r\nequal terms and in friendly rivalry in the classroom, while their\r\nparticular religious interests were entrusted to their respective clergy.\r\nBut this paternal care for the susceptibilities of Irish children, this\r\ncareful abhorrence of sectarian animosities, went hand in hand with an\r\nelaborate disregard of every distinctive national feeling and\r\ncharacteristic. English was the language of the school, while Irish was\r\nthe language of the fireside and of the street. Irish history was ignored:\r\nreferences to national and patriotic sentiments were carefully excluded,\r\nas a possible disturbing influence, from the approved text books: while\r\nthe privilege of being \"British,\" and the duty of feeling it to be a\r\nprivilege, were carefully inculcated.\r\n\r\nIt may seem extraordinary that such a system should have been accepted,\r\neven if the attempt to impose it were made. But in fact the bribe of\r\nknowledge is a great bribe; and in this case the consequence of taking it\r\nwas in obscurity. To learn English was to possess the only key to the\r\nknowledge that was offered, and when English was learnt, the language of\r\n\"progress\" crushed the language of tradition. A few far-seeing Irishmen,\r\nlike Archbishop MacHale, saw the inevitable tendency and endeavoured to\r\ncorrect it; but in general no one noticed that the Irish language was\r\ngoing until everyone noticed that it had gone. Men's minds were set upon\r\nother things. The struggle for political independence and political and\r\nsocial equality absorbed energy and attention, and the political struggle\r\nhad to be carried on by men who understood English. O'Connell's election\r\nfor the county of Clare struck a deadly blow at the preservation of the\r\nlanguage and at all that the preservation of the language implied: he\r\nhimself, with a miserable servility, refused to speak any tongue but the\r\ntongue of Parliament. The National Board of Education did not, it is true,\r\nescape criticism: but the criticism was directed not to its educational\r\nshortcomings or to its anti-national bias, but to its policy of \"religious\r\nindifference.\" The Presbyterian ministers were up in arms against a system\r\nby which \"the Gospel\" was excluded from the schools. They claimed the\r\nright to conduct the schools supported by the Board in defiance of the\r\nterms upon which the Board had promised to support them. They contended\r\nfor the principle of a programme in which the reading of the Bible might\r\nat any moment without notice be substituted by a Presbyterian teacher for\r\nany item on the programme for the day, any Catholic children who happened\r\nto be in attendance being allowed to withdraw, the responsibility for the\r\nchild's spiritual loss being solemnly laid upon the shoulders of the\r\nparents. The Protestant clergy, who were supposed as part of their duty to\r\nkeep schools in their parishes, though they had neglected the duty for\r\ngenerations, followed with similar claims. They stirred up their\r\ncongregations until mobs took to wrecking the National Schools in counties\r\nlike Antrim and Down, and rifle clubs were formed under the patronage of\r\nthe local aristocracy for the defence of their threatened Bibles. Under\r\nthe Ultramontane leadership of Cardinal Cullen the Catholic clergy adopted\r\na similar attitude. They alleged that the National system was hostile to\r\ntheir faith. Whatever danger to the faith had been contained in it had at\r\nany rate escaped the vigilance of Archbishop Murray and the authorities\r\nwhom he had consulted. But the spirit of religious animosity once let\r\nloose could not be chained; and the system which began by promoting the\r\nco-education of the two creeds, ended by a segregating of the population\r\nfrom infancy into hostile camps. This accomplished the end which was\r\ndesigned by nobody but reached by everybody, that of breaking down the\r\nfeeling of national unity and perpetuating feelings which it had been the\r\naim of patriots to obliterate.\r\n\r\nBut though the closing decade of the nineteenth century presented a\r\nspectacle of national disunion and apathy, of failing vigour and vanishing\r\nideals, it saw the beginning of a movement destined to arrest the decline\r\nof one department of the national life. The foundation of the Gaelic\r\nLeague in 1893 may be regarded as the turning point in the history of the\r\nlanguage. When it was on the verge of extinction its decline was stayed\r\nby the enthusiastic patriotism of Dr. Douglas Hyde. Non-political and\r\nnon-sectarian, the League worked for the restoration, preservation and\r\ndiffusion of the Irish language, Irish music and Irish industries. In its\r\ncouncils Catholic priests and laymen worked side by side with Protestant\r\nlaymen and ministers. It not only revived the language (its first and main\r\nobject) but it proved incidentally, as if in answer to a frequent but\r\nfoolish criticism, that Irishmen of different creeds and political\r\nopinions could sink their differences in the common interests of\r\npatriotism. It kept rigidly and sternly aloof from all connection with\r\nprofessedly political parties. It had no more to do with official\r\nNationalism than it had to do with Ulster Unionism. It resisted with\r\nsuccess the attempts of some of the clergy to interfere with its\r\nprogramme: in the case of the parish priest of Portarlington who objected\r\nto mixed classes on the specious ground of public morals it asserted its\r\nrights to control its own activities and established once for all, so far\r\nas it was concerned, the principle that the sphere of the clergy's\r\nactivities is not co-extensive with human life. It criticized the\r\nHierarchy with as much independence as it would have criticized a local\r\nBoard of Guardians; and in the end it won and held the enthusiastic\r\nsupport of the best elements in Irish life. Looking from things temporal\r\nand devoting itself to things of the mind, it widened the horizon and\r\ncleared the outlook of many districts through all Ireland. P. H. Pearse\r\nsaid with truth \"The Gaelic League will be recognized in history as the\r\nmost revolutionary influence that ever came into Ireland.\" The revolution\r\nwhich it wrought was moral, intellectual and spiritual and its influence\r\nin strengthening and developing the national character can hardly be\r\nover-estimated. Blamed alike for doing too much and for not doing enough,\r\nit adhered with undeviating consistency to its own programme and has been\r\nfully justified by its work. It stimulated activities in spheres far\r\nremote from its own. It enriched Anglo-Irish literature through the works\r\nof writers to whom it opened a new field and for whom it provided a fresh\r\nstimulus. There is hardly a writer in Ireland to-day of any promise in\r\neither prose or verse who does not owe a heavy debt to the work of the\r\nGaelic League.\r\n\r\nThe Gaelic League proceeded upon the assumption that Irishmen possessed\r\nand ought to possess an interest in the language of their own country. It\r\ndid not argue the point or indulge in academic discussions upon the\r\nutility of Gaelic as a medium of communication or upon the psychology of\r\nlanguage. Its simple appeal to a natural human feeling found a response\r\nwider than could have been evoked by a learned controversy or effected as\r\nthe fruit of a dialectical victory. But language is only a part of\r\nnationality and the attachment of a human being to the language of his\r\ncountry is only a special case of his attachment to the nation. This,\r\nthough the Gaelic League held aloof from all politics (in the narrow sense\r\nof the word), is what gave to the work of the Gaelic League a real\r\npolitical importance. The stimulation of national sentiment in one\r\ndepartment gave a stimulus to the same sentiment in other departments, and\r\nthe new and vigorous national sense which it fostered was bound to lead\r\nsooner or later to expression in political action. But even after this\r\npolitical activity began to be manifest, the League confined itself to its\r\noriginal work, and held as much aloof from politics infused by its own\r\nspirit as from the forms of political action which held the field when its\r\nwork began.\r\n\r\nSinn Fein is an expression in political theory and action of the claim of\r\nIreland to be a nation, with all the practical consequences which such a\r\nclaim involves. It differs from previous national movements principally in\r\nthe policy which it outlines for the attainment of its ultimate end, the\r\nindependence of Ireland: though it should be understood that nearly every\r\npoint in the Sinn Fein political programme had been at least suggested by\r\nsome previous Irish Nationalist thinker. In opposition to the\r\nParliamentary Party it held that for Ireland to send representatives to\r\nWestminster was to acknowledge the validity of the Act of Union and\r\nvirtually to deny the Irish claim to an independent legislature. In\r\ncontrast with the National movements of '48 and '67 it disclaimed the use\r\nof physical force for the attainment of its ends. While it held as a\r\nmatter of abstract political ethics that a nation subjugated against its\r\nwill by another nation is justified in regaining its independence, if it\r\ncan do so, by any means at its disposal, including force, yet as a matter\r\nof practical Irish politics it renounced the use of force unequivocally.\r\n\"It is because Ireland is to-day unable to overcome England on the\r\nbattlefield we preach the Sinn Fein policy,\" wrote the principal exponent\r\nof the policy in 1906. The remnants of the Fenian Brotherhood had no\r\nsympathy with a policy such as this: and though representatives of the\r\n\"physical force party\" were allowed to express their opinions in the Sinn\r\nFein papers, their views were not officially adopted and never became part\r\nof the Sinn Fein policy. At least one prominent member of the old Fenian\r\nParty saw reason to adopt the Sinn Fein policy in preference to that of\r\narmed force. \"I would not,\" wrote John Devoy from New York in 1911,\r\n\"incite the unorganized, undisciplined and unarmed people of Ireland to a\r\nhopeless military struggle with England.\" This renunciation of force was\r\nhowever very different from O'Connell's famous declaration of his\r\nintention not to fight. While Sinn Fern held that the most practical way\r\nto establish Irish freedom in the twentieth century was not the way of\r\nforce it never concealed its opinion that force was a legitimate method of\r\nsecuring national rights. In fact no responsible national leader has ever\r\nheld any other opinion in any country.\r\n\r\nNor was the Sinn Fein Party in its inception a Republican Party. It was\r\nstrictly constitutional, and in fact forfeited the support of many ardent\r\nNationalists by adherence to this definitely constitutional policy. While\r\nthe Parliamentary Party claimed to be the only constitutional party by its\r\nuse of the forms of the existing constitution, Sinn Fein laid claim to the\r\nmerit of a superior constitutionalism. It relied upon the Renunciation Act\r\nof 1783 which declared that the right \"claimed by the people of Ireland to\r\nbe bound only by laws enacted by his Majesty and the Parliament of that\r\nkingdom, in all cases whatever, and to have all actions and suits at law\r\nor in equity which may be instituted in that kingdom decided in his\r\nMajesty's courts therein finally and without appeal from thence shall be\r\nand it is hereby declared to be established and ascertained forever and\r\nshall at no time hereafter be questioned or questionable.\" The Act of\r\nUnion, carried as it was, was a clear breach of this declaration, and the\r\npolicy of Sinn Fein was to ignore, holding it as null and void, the Union\r\nand every subsequent arrangement made in contravention of the Act of 1783.\r\nIf it came to a question of constitutionalism Sinn Fein took up a High\r\nTory attitude compared with the accommodating constitutionalism of the\r\nofficial Nationalist Party.\r\n\r\nThough Sinn Fein as a political organization in being did not exist till\r\n1905 the way had been smoothed for it and several actual steps taken\r\nseveral years before. The first symptom of the coming movement was the\r\nestablishment of literary societies which drew their inspiration from the\r\nYoung Ireland movement of the 'forties, and the publication in Belfast by\r\nMiss Alice Milligan of the _Shan Van Vocht_, a literary and political\r\njournal which became a semi-official exponent of the new Irish-Ireland\r\nmovement. The centenary celebration of the Rebellion of 1798 led to a\r\nquickening of interest in the history of Irish separatist movements and an\r\nendeavour was made to keep the interest from dying out by the\r\nestablishment of '98 Clubs. Finally in 1899 the _United Irishman_ was\r\nfounded by Mr. Arthur Griffith.\r\n\r\nThe title which Mr. Griffith chose for his paper is significant. The\r\nadoption of the name of John Mitchel's paper was more than a hint that\r\nJohn Mitchel's policy was to be revived. But it was to be the policy, not\r\nof the abortive revolution of '48, but that expressed earlier in a\r\nprescient passage. A plan (said Mitchel) for the repeal of the Union \"must\r\ndevelop not one sole plan followed out to the end, but three or four of\r\nthe possible and probable series of events which may evidently lead to the\r\nresult. It must show (for one way) how a parliamentary campaign, conducted\r\nhonestly and boldly, might bring the state of public business in\r\nParliament to such a position that repeal would be the only solution; for\r\nanother way, how systematic passive opposition to, and contempt of, _law_\r\nmight be carried out through a thousand details, so as to virtually\r\nsupersede English dominion here and to make the mere repealing statute an\r\nimmaterial formality (this, I may observe, is _my_ way); and for a third\r\nway how, in the event of an European war, a strong national party in\r\nIreland could grasp the occasion to do the work instantly.... It should\r\nalso show how and to what extent all these methods of operation might be\r\ncombined.\" In this one passage Mitchel sketched successively the Parnell\r\npolicy, the Sinn Fein policy and the policy of the Easter Rising.\r\n\r\n_The United Irishman_ ran as a weekly paper from March 4, 1899, to April\r\n14, 1906. During this time twenty-three issues were seized and confiscated\r\nin the Post Office and upon three occasions in the year 1900 the paper was\r\npublicly suppressed. In 1905 the Secret Service threatened the printer\r\nwith prosecution unless the printing of the paper was discontinued; and in\r\n1906 the increasing liabilities of the United Irishman Publishing Company\r\n(who engaged Mr. Griffith as editor) led to the discontinuance of the\r\npaper. But before it ceased publication the Sinn Fein Movement had been\r\nsuccessfully inaugurated. The paper was remarkable for the ability with\r\nwhich it was edited, the literary excellence of its articles both\r\neditorial and contributed, the range of its topics and the freedom which\r\nit allowed to the discussion in its columns of different views. Its\r\ncontributors included many of the best-known Irish writers, though many of\r\nthem were not (or did not remain) in sympathy with its political\r\npropaganda. It championed the cause of the Gaelic League, of native\r\nindustries, of native music and of native games. It spread information\r\nupon the mineral resources of Ireland, its waterways, its railways, its\r\nvital statistics, and the menace of emigration. It republished as serials\r\nsuch standard works as John Mitchel's _Apology_ and an authorized\r\ntranslation of D'Arbois de Jubainville's _Irish Mythological Cycle_. Mr.\r\nBest contributed a series of articles on \"The Old Irish Bardic Tales.\" It\r\npublished a drama by W. B. Yeats and its columns were always open to\r\nliterary and dramatic criticisms and discussions. It had a weekly column\r\non European politics. And finally it argued with courage, brilliancy and\r\npassion the cause of Irish independence.\r\n\r\nThe editorial in the first number gives a general idea both of the style\r\nand of the teaching of the paper. \"There exists, has existed for\r\ncenturies, and will continue to exist in Ireland, a conviction hostile to\r\nthe subjection, or dependence of the fortunes of this country to the\r\nnecessities of any other; we intend to voice that conviction. We bear no\r\nill will to any section of the Irish political body, whether its flag be\r\ngreen or orange, which holds that tortuous paths are the safest for\r\nIrishmen to tread; but, knowing we are governed by a nation which\r\nreligiously adheres to 'The good old rule--the simple plan--that those may\r\ntake who have the power, and those may keep who can,' we, with all respect\r\nfor our friends who love the devious ways, are convinced that an\r\noccasional exhibition of the naked truth will not shock the modesty of\r\nIrishmen and that a return to the straight road will not lead us to\r\npolitical destruction.... To be perfectly plain, we believe that when\r\nSwift wrote to the whole people of Ireland 170 years ago, that by the law\r\nof God, of Nature, and of nations they had a right to be as free a people\r\nas the people of England, he wrote commonsense; notwithstanding that in\r\nthese latter days we have been diligently taught that by the law of God,\r\nof Nature, and of nations we are rightfully entitled to the establishment\r\nin Dublin of a legislative assembly with an expunging angel watching over\r\nits actions from the Viceregal Lodge. We do not deprecate the institution\r\nof any such body, but we do assert that the whole duty of an Irishman is\r\nnot comprised in utilizing all the forces of his nature to procure its\r\ninception.... With the present day Irish movements outside politics we are\r\nin more or less sympathy. The Financial Reformers ... are incidentally\r\ndoing good in promoting an union of Irishmen in opposition to their one\r\nenemy; the resuscitation of our national language is a work in which\r\neveryone of us should help; at the same time we would regret any\r\ninsistence on a knowledge of Gaelic as a test of patriotism. It is\r\nscarcely necessary to say we are in full sympathy with the objects of the\r\nAmnesty Association; but we shall not at any time support an appeal to any\r\nsuch myths as English Justice or English Mercy.... Lest there might be any\r\ndoubt in any mind we will say that we accept the Nationalism of '98, '48\r\nand '67 as the true Nationalism and Grattan's cry 'Live Ireland-Perish the\r\nEmpire!' as the watchword of patriotism.\"\r\n\r\nThe political creed of the _United Irishman_ was the absolute independence\r\nof Ireland; and though it did not advocate the methods of armed revolution\r\nit opened its columns to those Nationalists who did: though its policy was\r\nthe re-establishment of the Constitution of 1782, not the establishment of\r\nan Irish Republic, it contained articles written by Republicans who made\r\nno secret of their views. But the object of this, confusing to the\r\ncareless or intermittent reader, was gradually to build up a kind of\r\nnational forum in which all \"real\" Nationalists might have their say, and\r\nto induce a general consensus of opinion in favour of the new policy. Its\r\naim at first was strictly critical and educational. In writing of the '98\r\nClubs the editor says: \"We look to them for the fostering of a national\r\nand tolerant public opinion, which will raise the _morale_ of the people,\r\nso grievously lowered by the squalid agitations of the past; we look to\r\nthem for the inculcation of the doctrine of self-reliance, without which\r\nneither our land nor any other can hope for salvation; and we look to them\r\nanxiously for the teaching and training of youth, for our future depends\r\nlargely on the young.\" Everything was made to turn upon the question of\r\nself-reliance and independence: what inculcated or enhanced these\r\nqualities was good, what hindered them was bad or (at best) indifferent.\r\nPolitical independence was regarded as the sequel and corollary of moral\r\nindependence, and all political action that sacrificed this stood\r\nself-condemned. Under this condemnation fell in the first place the Irish\r\nParliamentary Party: their policy was derided as one of \"half-bluster and\r\nhalf-whine\": when Mr. Redmond spoke, in an unguarded moment, of \"wringing\r\nfrom whatever Government may be in power the full measure of a nation's\r\nrights\" he was bluntly told that all this was \"arrant humbug.\" \"After one\r\nhundred years of the British Parliament we are poorer and fewer, and our\r\ntaxation has been multiplied by ten. All the signs of the times point to\r\nthe continuance of this policy of practically burning the candle at both\r\nends; and our self-respect and our status before the nations of Europe\r\nwould be infinitely raised by a manly refusal to lend the support of our\r\npresence to an assembly in which our interests are ignored whenever they\r\nclash, and sometimes when they do not clash, with the interests of\r\nEngland. If our 'Parliamentary representatives' had spirit, they would\r\nhave retired from the British Parliament when the Home Rule Bill was\r\ndefeated, and have told their constituents that they were wasting time in\r\nfighting Ireland's battle with British weapons and that further\r\nrepresentation at Westminster was 'neither possible nor desirable.' That\r\nwould have been a protest that would have roused the attention of the\r\ncivilized world and even now it would be well that such a protest should\r\nbe made; for it _is_ waste of time and money and a source of degradation\r\nto countenance a system which ignores us.... By turning their attention to\r\nthe practical development of industries in Ireland and pledging\r\nthemselves to a policy of practical support and preference for the\r\nproducts of Irish labour, our people can undoubtedly advance the social\r\ncondition and prosperity of the country; but while they are hoping against\r\nhope for some vague indefinite assistance from Westminster, a genuine\r\nmanly effort in this direction is impossible.\"\r\n\r\nIf the Parliamentary Party was charged with futility and lack of dignity,\r\nother Irish movements were criticized with a similar candour. Even the\r\nGaelic League did not win the entire and unqualified approval of the\r\nnational Mentor. The \"persistent labouring of the fact that the language\r\nquestion is non-political\" was held to savour of a certain lack of candour\r\nand of courage. The Gaelic movement (it was said) had for its aim \"the\r\nintensifying of Irish sentiment, the preservation of Irish ideals\": it\r\naroused enthusiasm \"by awakening memories hot with hate and fierce with\r\ndesire of vengeance on the foreigner.\" It was asserted that \"as a factor\r\ntowards freedom, and as such _alone_, the people will respond to its\r\nclaims upon them: for them culture has no charms\"; and the League was\r\nbluntly told that it could not continue to pursue its policy of aloofness.\r\n\"With politics,\" wrote William Rooney (who seems to have held a unique\r\nposition of authority and trust in the new movement up to the time of his\r\nearly death), \"as at present understood, and which, after all, mean\r\nnothing but partisanship, the Gaelic League has rightly had nothing to do;\r\nbut with politics, in the sense of some public policy aiming at the\r\nreincarnation of an Irish nation, it cannot refuse to meddle.\" The Gaelic\r\nLeague, like the Parliamentary Party, pursued its way undisturbed: but the\r\ncriticism was not unmarked. And the Catholic clergy (so often represented\r\nas immune from the criticism of all good Irish Nationalists) were\r\nfaithfully (and not always tenderly) taken to task when they wandered from\r\nthe straight path; it was said that they took no effective steps to arrest\r\nemigration: that they \"next to the British Government\" were \"responsible\r\nfor the depopulation of the country\": that they failed to encourage Irish\r\ntrade and manufactures: that the priests \"made life dull and unendurable\r\nfor the people\": that the Hierarchy had backed the Parliamentary Party\r\nagainst the Nationalists of '48 and '67: that they were apathetic on the\r\nquestion of the language. It was asserted that the priesthood with their\r\nexaggerated caution with regard to the natural relations of the sexes had\r\n\"brought a Calvinistic gloom and horror into Ireland\"; \"To-day the land is\r\ndotted with religious edifices but the men and women whose money built\r\nthem are fleeing to America to seek for bread.\" \"It is high time this\r\nmonstrous hypocrisy should be faced and fought. While the country is\r\nmaking a last fight for existence its people are being bled right and left\r\nto build all kinds of church edifices and endow all kinds of church\r\ninstitutions and their money is being sent abroad to England, Italy, and\r\nGermany.... We strongly advise the Irish people not to subscribe a single\r\npenny in future towards the eternal church building funds unless they\r\nfirst receive public assurances that their money will be expended in\r\nIreland.\" These criticisms are characteristic of the candour and\r\nconsistency with which the test was applied to all movements, bodies and\r\ninstitutions in Ireland: were they or were they not a factor in the\r\nmaterial and moral upbuilding of the Irish nation as a free and\r\nself-reliant community.\r\n\r\nThe war against the Transvaal Republics made the question of recruiting\r\nfor the army a question of public importance in Ireland during the early\r\ndays of the paper, and its articles on the subject first brought it into\r\nconflict with the Castle authorities. That Mr. Chamberlain's policy was\r\ndirected to the extinction of Transvaal independence was self-evident and\r\nthe war on that account was not popular in Ireland. In the Boers\r\nstruggling hopelessly for the maintenance of their freedom was seen an\r\nanalogue of the long Irish struggle for independence, and any Irishman who\r\nenlisted in the British army was denounced as \"a traitor to his country\r\nand a felon in his soul.\" But it was not the crushing of Transvaal\r\nindependence in which the army was employed that formed the only argument\r\nagainst enlisting. The official returns of the statistics of venereal\r\ndisease in the British army were printed with a commentary of provoking\r\nfrankness. The excesses of the British army in Burmah and the charges made\r\nagainst the soldiers for offences against Burmese women were insisted\r\nupon to prove that no decent Irishman could join the army. But in fact it\r\nwas something more than the sufferings of the Boers and the Burmese which\r\ninspired this attitude. The British army was regarded as the instrument by\r\nwhich Ireland was held in subjugation, as the force which upheld the power\r\nto whose interests Ireland was sacrificed. One of the concluding numbers\r\nof the paper printed the text of an anti-recruiting pamphlet for the\r\ndistribution of which prosecutions were instituted. It concluded: \"Let\r\nEngland fight her own battles: we have done it long enough. Let her arm\r\nand drill the sickly population of her slums: the men of the hills and\r\ncountry places in Ireland will go no more. Let her fight for the extension\r\nof her Empire herself, for the men of the Gael are not going to be bribed\r\ninto betraying themselves and their country again at the bidding of\r\nEngland.\" It was found difficult to obtain convictions against persons who\r\ndistributed these pamphlets. Even in Belfast a jury refused to convict a\r\nman for this at the instance of the Crown: though the accused made no\r\nexcuse or apology, and though his counsel said in his speech to the jury,\r\n\"You are fathers and brothers, and there is not one of you who would not\r\nrather see your boys in hell than in the British Army.\"\r\n\r\nThe seizure of the _United Irishman_ by order of Lord Cadogan in\r\nconsequence of its anti-recruiting propaganda served only to advertise its\r\nattitude, and secure for it some of the popularity which attends whatever\r\nis in conflict with the authorities in Ireland. It also urged the paper to\r\nfurther efforts in the same direction and from the time of Queen\r\nVictoria's visit in 1900, \"who now in her dotage,\" as the leader on the\r\nsubject ran, \"is sent amongst us to seek recruits for her battered army,\"\r\nit was in constant conflict with the Irish police.\r\n\r\nWhile the _United Irishman_ pursued its extensive and boisterous business,\r\nof which this full account is significant and pertinent, an organization\r\nof Irishmen who shared its views generally was being slowly formed. In one\r\nof the early numbers of the paper a contributed article on \"A National\r\nOrganization\" had appeared (and been approved of in a leader), urging the\r\nformation of a party \"with the openly avowed and ultimate object of ending\r\nBritish rule\" in Ireland; such an organization should honestly acknowledge\r\n\"its present inability to lead Ireland to victory against the armed might\r\nof her enemy\" and confine itself \"for some time to the disciplining of the\r\nmind and the training of the forces of the nation, whilst impressing on it\r\nthat, in the last resort, nothing save the weapons of freemen can regain\r\nits independence.... It need have no secrecy about it whatsoever.... Such\r\nan organization should ... require only two qualifications from its\r\nmembers, one, that they declare themselves advocates of an Irish Republic,\r\nthe other, that they be persons of decent character.... It should adopt no\r\nattitude of antagonism to the Parliamentarians; but point out to the\r\npeople that Parliamentarianism is not Nationalism, and leave them, in\r\ntheir own judgment, to give it what support they pleased. Toleration, free\r\nimpersonal criticism, and sympathy with every man seeking, after his own\r\nlight, the welfare of our common country, should be distinguishing\r\ncharacteristics of the organization and its members.\" Discussion of these\r\nproposals, partly favourable, partly critical, followed and in October,\r\n1900, the first steps were taken in the foundation of the Cumann na\r\nnGaedhal. Its objects were to advance the cause of Ireland's national\r\nindependence by (1) cultivating a fraternal spirit amongst Irishmen; (2)\r\ndiffusing knowledge of Ireland's resources and supporting Irish\r\nindustries; (3) the study and teaching of Irish history, literature,\r\nlanguage, music and art; (4) the assiduous cultivation and encouragement\r\nof Irish games, pastimes and characteristics; (5) the discountenancing of\r\nanything tending towards the anglicization of Ireland; (6) the physical\r\nand intellectual training of the young; (7) the development of an Irish\r\nforeign policy; (8) extending to each other friendly advice and aid,\r\nsocially and politically; (9) the nationalization of public boards.\r\nMembership was open to \"all persons of Irish birth or descent undertaking\r\nto obey its rules, carry out its constitution, and pledging themselves to\r\naid to the best of their ability in restoring Ireland to her former\r\nposition of sovereign independence.\" The _United Irishman_ commenting on\r\nthis observes: \"It comes to interfere with no policy before the people--it\r\nasks only the help and support of Irish Nationalists.... Let us be Irish\r\nin act and speech, as we pretend to be in heart and spirit, and a few\r\nyears will prove whether the remedy is not better sought at home among\r\nourselves than beyond the waters.\" While the association aimed at the\r\ncultivation of a spirit of self-reliance and the attainment of a moral\r\nindependence, it was clear that the realization of its ideals would be a\r\nslow process and would leave the actual political situation much as it\r\nwas. The whole Irish nation might talk Irish, play Irish games, support\r\nIrish industries, deanglicize their children, have their own ideas of\r\nforeign policy and love one another like brothers, and yet Ireland would\r\nnot have regained independence. The ends of Cumann na nGaedhal were remote\r\nand, if attained, unsatisfactory to those to whom independence meant more\r\nthan a mere lofty disregard of the truth that Ireland was as a matter of\r\nfact politically dependent on another country. Something more was needed\r\nto bring the new policy (if it could be called new) into more intimate\r\nconnection with political facts. The link with current politics was\r\nsupplied by Mr. Griffith in an address which he gave to the third annual\r\nconvention of Cumann na nGaedhal in October, 1902, in which he outlined\r\nwhat came to be known afterwards as the Hungarian Policy. The new policy,\r\ninstead of adopting a neutral attitude towards existing political parties\r\nin Ireland, boldly declared war upon the Irish Parliamentary Party. The\r\nConvention passed the following resolution: \"That we call upon our\r\ncountrymen abroad to withhold all assistance from the promoters of a\r\nuseless, degrading and demoralizing policy until such times as the members\r\nof the Irish Parliamentary Party substitute for it the policy of the\r\nHungarian Deputies of 1861, and, refusing to attend the British Parliament\r\nor to recognize its right to legislate for Ireland, remain at home to help\r\nin promoting Ireland's interests and to aid in guarding its national\r\nrights.\" With this resolution Sinn Fein may be said to have been\r\ninaugurated.\r\n\r\nThough the policy of abstention from Parliament came to be known as \"the\r\nHungarian Policy\" it was a policy that had been advocated, and to a\r\ncertain extent practised, in Ireland long before the Hungarian Deputies\r\nadopted it. In 1844, the \"Parliamentary Committee of the Loyal National\r\nRepeal Association on the Attendance of Irish Members in Parliament\"\r\npresented a report which contained the following: \"The people of Ireland,\r\nhaving in vain attempted to obtain from the Imperial Parliament detailed\r\nmeasures of justice, and with equal failure sought the restoration of\r\ntheir domestic Senate or even inquiry into the wisdom of that restoration,\r\nhave at length sought to obtain those rights by agitation out of\r\nParliament. They have to this end arrayed themselves into a Loyal and\r\nNational Association to obtain the Repeal of the Union. They try to obtain\r\nstrength by the reality and display of union and organization. They seek\r\nconverts by their speeches, their writings, and their peaceful virtues.\r\nThey are endeavouring to increase their knowledge and their power by\r\nreading, thinking and discussing. And to carry out their projects of\r\norganization, conversion and self-improvement, they subscribe large funds\r\nto a common treasury. Their efforts in the Imperial Parliament having then\r\nbeen so fruitless, and their undertaking at home being so vast, they, the\r\npeople of Ireland, have consented that such of their members as seek with\r\nthem domestic legislation, should secede from the Imperial Parliament and\r\ncontrol the agitation, instruction and organization of the people at\r\nhome.\" This report is signed by Thomas Davis. A correspondence between\r\nThomas Davis and the Earl of Wicklow, to whom certain resolutions of the\r\nRepeal Association had been sent, debates the rival merits of the policies\r\nof parliamentarianism and abstention. The Earl, who had no intention of\r\nleaving Parliament, wrote: \"I now believe that there exists amongst the\r\nBritish people an anxious desire to do justice to our country and to atone\r\nin every way in their power for the evils of former mismanagement.\" Lord\r\nWicklow had formed this conviction before 1844. The \"Hungarian Policy\" of\r\n1902 was framed for the same situation and in face of the same conviction.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to understand why the credit of the policy was not claimed\r\nfor Thomas Davis the Irishman instead of for the Hungarian Franz Deak:\r\nunless it be that the policy had in the case of Ireland never been put\r\ninto actual effective practice and had remained fruitless of result, while\r\nin Hungary it had seemed to have achieved its object. Be that as it may,\r\nMr. Arthur Griffith proceeded to contribute to the _United Irishman_ a\r\nseries of articles on \"The Resurrection of Hungary,\" reprinted in book\r\nform the same year and widely circulated. The preface represented the\r\npolicy as an alternative to that of armed resistance: the body of the book\r\ngave a historical account of the struggle of the Hungarians under Deak for\r\nthe restoration of the constitution of 1848 and its success, due (it was\r\nclaimed) entirely to Deak's policy of abstention from the Austrian\r\nImperial Parliament: the concluding chapter drew the parallel between\r\nHungary and Ireland, claiming that by abstaining from sending members to\r\nWestminster Ireland could secure the restoration of the constitution of\r\n1782. The book was interesting and able: the narrative was presented with\r\nvigour and spirit: but the accuracy of some of its statements and\r\nconclusions was open to question and as a piece of popular propaganda it\r\nwas a failure. While many people read it, it produced no immediate or\r\nwidespread response. Exception was taken to the view that Ireland ought to\r\naim at the restoration of the constitution of 1782: exception was taken to\r\nthe substitution of a peaceful for a forcible policy. \"If the Irish\r\nmembers\" (wrote a representative of the latter body of critics) \"of the\r\nEnglish Parliament withdrew from Westminster to-morrow the government of\r\nthe country would be carried on just as it is to-day; and so it will and\r\nmust be as long as the people forget they are Irishmen with a country to\r\nfree from a foreign yoke. The protest would end in smoke unless armed men\r\nwere prepared to back it.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Griffith, nothing daunted, continued his fight against on the one hand\r\nthe traditional parliamentarianism and on the other hand the advocates of\r\nphysical force and revolution and the members of the Republican Party. His\r\nclaim to independence for Ireland was to be based not upon force but upon\r\nlaw and the constitution of 1782: his claim was not a Republic but a\r\nnational constitution under an Irish Crown. He tried to show in a series\r\nof articles on \"The Working of the Policy\"--which from now on begins to be\r\nreferred to as the Sinn Fein Policy--how his ideas might be put into\r\npractice. But to carry on such a policy as he had outlined, some political\r\norganization other than the Cumann na nGaedhael or the '98 Clubs was\r\nrequired. This was inaugurated at a meeting held in Dublin on November\r\n28th, 1905, under the chairmanship of Mr. Edward Martyn. The policy of the\r\nnew body, the National Council, was defined as \"National self-development\r\nthrough the recognition of the rights and duties of citizenship on the\r\npart of the individual and by the aid and support of all movements\r\noriginating from within Ireland, instinct with national tradition and not\r\nlooking outside Ireland for the accomplishment of their aims.\" A public\r\nmeeting held afterwards in the Rotunda passed the following resolution:\r\n\"That the people of Ireland are a free people and that no law made without\r\ntheir authority and consent is or can ever be binding on their conscience.\r\nThat the General Council of County Councils presents the nucleus of a\r\nnational authority, and we urge upon it to extend the scope of its\r\ndeliberation and action: to take within its purview every question of\r\nnational interest and to formulate lines of procedure for the nation.\" Mr.\r\nGriffith, who was the main-spring and driving force of the movement,\r\nspeaking in favour of the resolution, proposed the formation of a council\r\nof 300 to sit in Dublin and form a _de facto_ Irish Parliament, with whom\r\nmight be associated all those members of Parliament who refused to attend\r\nat Westminster; its recommendations should be binding upon all County\r\nCouncils and Boards of Guardians, whose duty it would be to carry them\r\ninto effect as far as their powers extended.\r\n\r\nWith this meeting ends the preliminary stage, and Sinn Fein formally takes\r\nits place as a duly constituted political party with its own policy and\r\naims. The _United Irishman_, the organ of its infancy, ceased to exist,\r\nand its place was taken by _Sinn Fein_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EARLY YEARS OF SINN FEIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1906 Sinn Fein emerged from the region of ideals and\r\nabstractions, of academical discussion and preliminary propaganda, into\r\nthe arena of Irish party politics with a fully formulated practical\r\npolicy. Taking constitutional ground with the dictum that \"the\r\nconstitution of 1782 is still the constitution of Ireland,\" it proposed to\r\nshow how the people of Ireland, keeping within the letter of a law which\r\nthey could not otherwise break, might render nugatory the effort to hold\r\nthe country in dependence upon England in pursuance of the Act of Union.\r\nIt proposed to arrest the anglicization of Ireland by recovering for the\r\nIrish people the management of those departments of public administration\r\nin which the anglicizing process was working most markedly to the\r\ndetriment of Irish interests and which might be remodelled without any\r\nactual breach of the existing law. In the first place it seemed necessary\r\nto take education in hand, and by the introduction of a system more in\r\naccordance with Irish needs and capabilities and characteristics,\r\nendeavour to train up a generation of young Irish men and women, imbued\r\nwith a national spirit and national pride, capable of taking their part in\r\nthe agricultural, industrial and administrative life of the country.\r\nCounty Councils might do much in this direction through their intimate\r\nconnection with the administration and policy of the Department of\r\nAgriculture and Technical Instruction; a wise use of the means placed by\r\nthe Department at their disposal might in a few years revolutionize to the\r\nadvantage of Ireland the entire education of the country. The young men\r\nand women thus trained might form the nucleus of an Irish Civil Service,\r\nif the County Councils could be induced to abandon their \"patronage\" in\r\nthe positions at their disposal and throw them open to competitive\r\nexamination; others of these trained Irishmen might be employed in an\r\nunofficial Irish Consular Service to the great advantage of Irish\r\ncommerce, handicapped in foreign markets by English consuls in the\r\ninterests of the English commercial houses. Pressure could be brought to\r\nbear upon the Irish banks to adopt a policy more in sympathy with Irish\r\ntrade and industry. There was deposited in Irish banks a sum of\r\nL50,000,000, the savings of the people of Ireland; yet these banks\r\ninvested this money in English securities (the Bank of Ireland during the\r\nSouth African War even lent money to the English Government without\r\ninterest) while Irish industries were starving for lack of the capital\r\nwhich the banks refused to lend. The Stock Exchange, controlled by the\r\nGovernment, neglected to quote shares in Irish companies that might be\r\nformed for the furtherance of particular industries in particular\r\ndistricts, discouraging investors who were thus left unable to dispose of\r\ntheir shares in the ordinary way. It was hoped that public bodies as well\r\nas private persons could be induced to bring pressure to bear on the banks\r\nby withdrawing or withholding accounts until they should adopt a more\r\npatriotic policy, though it was more difficult to see how the Stock\r\nExchange could be dealt with. The difficulties put by railways and their\r\nheavy freights on the exchange of commodities could be obviated by a\r\ndevelopment of the Irish waterways under the control of popularly elected\r\nbodies: the County Councils should see to this and to questions such as\r\nafforestation and the encouragement of home manufactures by specifying\r\ntheir use in the giving of contracts for institutions under their control.\r\nThe Poor Law system should be remodelled in accordance with Irish\r\nsentiment and the money expended upon it spent in Ireland upon Irish\r\ngoods. To ensure the advantage of foreign markets without English\r\ninterference an Irish Mercantile Marine should be established, what could\r\nbe done even by a poor country in this way being shown by the example of\r\nNorway, where nearly everyone was at least part owner of a ship.\r\n\r\nBut to stimulate and foster native industry and native manufacture was to\r\nMr. Griffith (whose writings on economic matters formed a kind of gospel\r\nfor Sinn Fein) an urgent and supreme duty. He was convinced that until\r\nIreland became an industrial as well as an agricultural country her\r\neconomic position was insecure. Thinking always in terms of national\r\nindependence, which he interpreted to mean national ability to dispense\r\nwith outside assistance, he looked forward to a time when Ireland should\r\nbe able not merely to feed her population from her own resources, but to\r\nsupply them with nearly all the other necessaries of modern life. Irish\r\ncoal and iron existed in abundance to supply the necessary fuel and raw\r\nmaterial; there was plenty of native marble and other stones for building;\r\nIrish wool and hides were once famous over Europe for their abundance and\r\nexcellence. All that was required to make Ireland once more a prosperous\r\nmanufacturing country was at her disposal within her own boundaries, and\r\nonly waited for the policy that would call out her latent powers. In an\r\nindependent State the encouragement required would be forthcoming in\r\nprotective legislation, pursued until the protected industry became\r\nestablished and able to compete on favourable terms with similar\r\nindustries in other countries, the work of protection being limited\r\nstrictly to the task of building up a temporary screen to shelter a\r\nbudding national industry from the wind of competition until its strength\r\nwas established. The Irish Parliament in the days of its independence had\r\nadopted this policy, which had enabled it during its short life to secure\r\nto Irish manufactures an unprecedented prosperity. But Ireland, deprived\r\nof legislative powers, might fall back upon a less secure but still\r\nefficacious method of protection. Irish consumers might refuse to purchase\r\nEnglish goods while Irish goods of the same quality were to be had, and\r\nbe content to pay in an enhanced price their share of what under other\r\ncircumstances the State might have expended in bounties to the industry;\r\npublic bodies might insist upon the use of goods of Irish manufacture;\r\nport authorities should arrange port dues so that they should fall most\r\nheavily on manufactured goods brought into the country, and should publish\r\nperiodical returns of the imports of manufactured goods at every port in\r\nIreland; Irish capital should be invited and encouraged to undertake the\r\ndevelopment of the country on industrial and commercial lines, being\r\nassured, in the support of industrial and corporate public feeling, of\r\nencouragement and success in its enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn expounding this theory of protection and of the vital necessity to a\r\ncountry of developing its industrial life Mr. Griffith was confessedly\r\nfollowing the economic doctrines of the German economist Friedrich List,\r\n\"the man whom England caused to be persecuted by the Government of his\r\nnative country, and whom she hated and feared more than any man since\r\nNapoleon--the man who saved Germany from falling a prey to English\r\neconomics, and whose brain conceived the great industrial and economic\r\nGermany of to-day.\" A man with credentials like these might well be\r\nlistened to with profit. The commercial policy that made the New Germany\r\ncould not fail to make a New Ireland, and List made seductive promises. He\r\nforetold an increase in population by a combination of agricultural and\r\nindustrial enterprise greater in proportion than by the development of\r\neither industry or agriculture by itself: he denied the possibility of\r\nintellectual progress to a country relying solely or mainly upon\r\nagriculture: culture marched behind the mill and the factory. But the\r\nchief merit of the policy undoubtedly was that it promised a\r\nself-contained and independent economic existence, serving as the basis of\r\na distinctive national culture.\r\n\r\nThe merits of List's theories in the abstract it is for economists to\r\ndetermine: but the concrete instance of the commercial expansion of\r\nGermany seemed at the time a sufficient vindication of their merit. But\r\nGermany was an independent State, competent to fix its own tariffs, give\r\nState encouragement to its industries and determine its own destinies.\r\nIreland could do none of these things: the efforts of individuals,\r\nsocieties and local bodies would have to supply the place of legislative\r\ncontrol, their efforts must be voluntary and would be difficult to control\r\nand co-ordinate. To ensure the will to follow out the suggested policy if\r\nit were even accepted, and to secure its acceptance, was a work of\r\nargument and controversy, and to secure a sympathetic or even attentive\r\naudience was not easy. Great claims were made upon the national\r\nintelligence and the national conscience, and success could only be\r\nensured by practical unanimity. Unanimity was not to be had, and could\r\nhardly be expected in the near future: the task of securing it was one to\r\ntax the resources of a generation of apostles, in the absence of some\r\ncataclysm which might involve a complete change in the general outlook and\r\nensure the acceptance of the policy by the mere force of circumstances.\r\nMeanwhile something might be done to co-ordinate spasmodic and voluntary\r\neffort. In the absence of a Parliament it might be possible to bring\r\ntogether a representative assembly whose directions and decisions might\r\ncarry a moral sanction to the conscience of an awakened public and to this\r\nend it was proposed to constitute a Council of Three Hundred, forming a\r\n_de facto_ Irish Parliament. A similar council had been suggested by\r\nO'Connell, prolific of expedients: but, sterile in execution, he had never\r\npermitted it to meet and transact business. The expedient was now to be\r\nrevived: the Council was, upon report from special committees (such as\r\nthose that had been appointed by the Repeal Association) \"to deliberate\r\nand formulate workable schemes, which, once formulated, it would be the\r\nduty of all County and Urban Councils, Rural Councils, Poor Law Boards,\r\nand other bodies to give legal effect to so far as their powers permit,\r\nand where these legal powers fell short, to give it the moral force of law\r\nby instructing and inducing those whom they represent to honour and obey\r\nthe recommendations of the Council of Three Hundred, individually and\r\ncollectively.\" Finally, Arbitration Courts were to be instituted to\r\nsupersede the ordinary courts of law in civil cases, which \"would deprive\r\nthe corrupt bar of Ireland of much of its incentive to corruption\" and\r\nfoster a spirit of brotherhood.\r\n\r\nSuch was the new policy: and it was claimed that \"not on recognition of\r\nusurped authority, but on its denial--not on aid from our enemies but on\r\naction for ourselves, the Sinn Fein policy is based. Its essence is\r\nconstruction and its march to its ultimate political goal must be attended\r\nat every step by the material progress of the nation.\" The work of\r\nexposition and instruction was carried on partly in the columns of _Sinn\r\nFein_ partly by means of clubs and branches through the country. A branch\r\nwas formed in Belfast in the early autumn of 1906, and at the meeting of\r\nthe National Council a month later it was announced that there were\r\nalready twenty branches in existence. At that meeting resolutions were\r\npassed in favour of boycotting articles of common consumption from which\r\nthe British Exchequer derives its chief revenue (a measure recommended\r\nlong before by the Young Ireland Party), in favour of new systems of\r\nprimary and secondary education, of competitive examinations for County\r\nCouncil appointments and of a National Banking System.\r\n\r\nThe Appeal which the National Council issued for support was based on the\r\nground that the Council \"denies the right of any foreign legislature to\r\nmake laws to bind the people of Ireland, denies the authority of any\r\nforeign administration to exist in Ireland, and denies the wisdom of\r\ncountenancing the existence of an usurped authority in Irish affairs by\r\nparticipating in the proceedings of the British Parliament.\"\r\n\r\nThe two years following 1906 saw a great advance in the spread of Sinn\r\nFein principles. Debates were organized with members of the other\r\nNationalist organizations, reading rooms were established and lectures\r\ngiven. In Belfast, the Dungannon Club, a separatist organization which had\r\nfor some time published a small and ably conducted paper called the\r\n_Republic_, as well as a series of pamphlets, now amalgamated with the\r\nWest Belfast Branch of the National Council. Every care was taken to\r\nprevent the movement assuming a sectional as distinct from a national\r\ntendency. Every instance of intolerance towards a fellow-Irishman\r\ncommitted by members of any political party was faithfully pilloried in\r\nthe columns of _Sinn Fein_. When the Westport Guardians (for example)\r\ndemanded the dismissal of Canon Hannay from his chaplaincy for being the\r\nauthor of _The Seething Pot_, which offended the political sensibilities\r\nof the worthy Guardians, he found no more strenuous advocate, and the\r\nGuardians no more unsparing critic, than _Sinn Fein_. In Dublin the\r\nmovement was particularly strong, and even succeeded in securing the\r\nreturn of some of its candidates at the elections to the City Council.\r\nWhen the Liberal Government in 1906 offered Mr. Redmond, in place of a\r\nHome Rule Bill, what was known as the Devolution Bill, the sincerity of\r\nEnglish parties in their dealings with Ireland began to be widely\r\nquestioned and Sinn Fein received an additional impetus. An official Sinn\r\nFein handbook, \"Leabhar na hEireann the Irish Year Book,\" was published\r\ncontaining, in addition to articles on the Sinn Fein policy, a number of\r\nvaluable statistics with reference to Irish resources, enterprises,\r\nmovements and parties, both political and religious. At last in 1908 the\r\ntime seemed to have come for contesting a parliamentary election. Mr. C.\r\nJ. Dolan, the sitting member for North Leitrim, declared himself a convert\r\nto the new movement. He resigned his seat and offered himself for\r\nre-election as a Sinn Fein candidate. He polled less than a third of the\r\nvotes, and Sinn Fein received a serious setback. In fact the ground had\r\nnot been sufficiently prepared. A weekly paper, supplemented by a few\r\npamphlets, with no great circulation outside Dublin, was an insufficient\r\ninstrument with which to achieve the success of a new policy within two\r\nyears. It was proposed and attempted to repair the error by the\r\nestablishment of a daily edition of _Sinn Fein_. But the movement had made\r\nno progress among the more prosperous classes. The paper was in\r\ndifficulties from the start and an attempt to make it more popular by\r\nincreasing it from four pages to eight committed it beyond recall to\r\nfailure. Meanwhile a Sinn Fein Co-operative Bank had been established,\r\nand, pushing ahead, the party issued a programme to which candidates for\r\nelection to all elected bodies in Ireland were to be asked to subscribe.\r\nThey were asked to pledge themselves to support the independence of\r\nIreland, a system of protection for Irish industries, the establishment of\r\nan Irish Consular Service and an Irish Mercantile Marine, a general\r\nsurvey and development of the mineral resources of Ireland, an Irish\r\nNational Bank, National Stock Exchange and National Civil Service,\r\nNational Courts of Arbitration, a National System of Insurance, National\r\nControl of Transit and Fisheries, a reform of the educational system, the\r\nabolition of the poorhouses, the gradual introduction of the Irish\r\nlanguage as the official language of public boards. In addition they were\r\nto agree to refuse to recognize the British Parliament, and to discourage\r\nthe consumption of articles paying duty to the British Treasury and the\r\nenlistment of Irishmen in the British Army.\r\n\r\nThis ambitious programme met with little or no response, and with the\r\ncollapse of the daily paper the apathy of the general public became more\r\nmarked. On the mass of Unionist Ireland, especially in Ulster, Sinn Fein\r\nhad practically no influence. The movement for the reform of the financial\r\nrelations between England and Ireland which had followed the publication\r\nof the Report of the Financial Relations Committee in 1896 had been the\r\nlast All-Ireland movement in which Unionist Ulster had taken part. But\r\nafter a brief period of enthusiasm the movement had come to nothing.\r\nThough the Report showed that Ireland had been since the Union, and partly\r\nin contravention of the express terms of that Act, the victim of grave\r\nfinancial injustice, being over-taxed to the amount of\r\ntwo-and-three-quarter millions of pounds per annum, nothing was done to\r\nremedy the grievance. The English Government was obdurate: the landlords\r\ngradually ceased to take any prominent part in the movement for fear of\r\nprejudicing their class interests. Unionist Ireland, especially in Ulster,\r\nallowed its morbid suspicion of everything in which the rest of the\r\ncountry was interested to overbear (as usual) its patriotism and its\r\ncommon sense, and Nationalist Ireland lost interest in the matter in\r\npursuit of other objects. The Financial Reform Association had been\r\ndissolved in 1899 and the country settled down again to the old political\r\nstruggle. The Nationalist Party fought shy of the raising of all\r\nfundamental questions. Its policy was to \"wrest from whatever Government\r\nwas in power the full measure of a nation's rights,\" that is to say, to\r\ngain as full a measure of Home Rule from either Liberals or Conservatives\r\nas the exigencies of English politics and the opinion of the English\r\npublic might make possible. Their aim was not to educate Irish public\r\nopinion or to convince Irish opposition. It was taken for granted that the\r\nLiberal Party would some day bring in a Home Rule Bill and carry it\r\nagainst the Conservative Party, and that that would end the matter: that\r\nthe Conservatives (according to the English party system of government)\r\nwould accept \"the verdict of the people,\" yielding to the inevitable, and\r\nthat the Irish Unionists would have to follow suit. To discuss the\r\nfundamentals of the problem, to endeavour to unite Irishmen (so far as\r\nargument and a generally understood common interest could unite them) was\r\ntiresome, irrelevant and tending to the subversion of party discipline.\r\nFor the policy now adopted by the Parliamentarians \"a united party\" was\r\nabove all things essential; and the unity desired meant not merely a\r\ncommon aim but an agreement upon all details: the great offence was\r\n\"faction,\" and under faction was comprised all independent criticism\r\neither of policy or of principle. A party thus constituted was, if things\r\nwent well and it was wisely led, an invaluable instrument of parliamentary\r\nwarfare at Westminster; but if things went wrong or a mistake was made, or\r\nif Westminster should cease at any time to be the centre of interest,\r\ndisaster was sure to follow. And this conception of the duty of an Irish\r\nNational Party overlooked the possibilities latent in Ulster Unionism. To\r\nan extent, not at the time fully grasped by anyone in Ireland, it stood\r\nnot for the Unionist Party, as that party was understood in England, but\r\nfor itself alone. The exigencies of party warfare required that it, like\r\nthe Nationalist Party, should attach itself to an English party; that it\r\nshould adopt the parlance of English parties; that it should declare its\r\nunbending loyalty to Imperial interests and the British Constitution. But\r\nit was not inclined to admit in practice that the British Constitution\r\ncould override its own particular interests. It could not be ignored or\r\nflouted with impunity; it was the rock upon which all schemes based upon\r\nthe peaceful possibilities of English parliamentary situations were\r\ndestined in the end to make shipwreck.\r\n\r\nBut the rock was not yet in sight and its existence was unsuspected. It\r\nwas common ground to the two Irish parties that the arena was Parliament\r\nand that the prize should go to the party which won the game according to\r\nWestminster rules. It is easy now for those who kept their eyes shut to\r\nsay that they would have opened them if everybody else had not been born\r\nblind, and it would be more dignified to say nothing. But the fact remains\r\nthat the mistake was made.\r\n\r\nDuring the lean years for its policy that followed 1908, _Sinn Fein_\r\ncontinued persistently to preach its doctrines: that to obtain \"the full\r\nmeasure of a nation's rights\" Ireland must rely not upon outside aid but\r\nupon her own efforts: that all Irishmen had a common interest, and that\r\ninterest not the interest of England: that all Irishmen, whether called\r\nNationalist or Unionist, were brothers in a common country impoverished\r\nand weakened by the loss of independence resulting from the Act of Union,\r\nand that to recognize their common interests and understand one another\r\nwas their immediate object. It published articles on the destruction of\r\nIrish industries in the interests of those of England, a destruction\r\narrested by the Constitution of 1782, and acting without restraint since\r\nthe loss of that Constitution by the Act of Union. It welcomed literary\r\ncontributions by the most eminent Irish men of letters, without\r\ndistinction of politics or religion: it preached unceasingly the\r\ndoctrines of toleration and goodwill amongst Irishmen. But as the prospect\r\nof the triumph of parliamentarianism through its alliance with the Liberal\r\nParty grew brighter, interest centred more and more upon the doings of\r\nParliament and the vicissitudes of parliamentary fortunes. Now at last the\r\ndream of a century was to take shape in something resembling a substance,\r\nand the time for discussion, arrangement and accommodation was over. In\r\nApril, 1910, _Sinn Fein_ announced on behalf of its party that Mr. John\r\nRedmond, having now the chance of a lifetime to obtain Home Rule, will be\r\ngiven a free hand, without a word said to embarrass him. But it was\r\ndifficult not to speak sometimes. When the Liberal Budget left the House\r\nof Commons that month, before the veto of the House of Lords had been\r\nabolished, Mr. Redmond's acquiescence in these tactics was freely\r\ncensured. When in the autumn of the same year Mr. Redmond committed\r\nhimself to the declaration: \"We do not want to discontinue our\r\nrepresentation in the House of Commons when Home Rule comes; we desire to\r\nhave Irish members sitting at Westminster not only to form a nucleus of\r\nthe ultimate Federal Parliament of the Empire, but also to assist in\r\nlegislation concerning Great Britain and Ireland collectively,\" the\r\ndeclaration was quoted with disgust. The Home Rule of the Liberal Party\r\nwas indeed far removed from the Constitution of 1782.\r\n\r\nSinn Fein took no official part in the elections of 1910, preferring, as\r\nit said in its official organ, to remain \"wholly free from any moral\r\nresponsibility\" for the legislation offered by the Liberals to the\r\nParliamentary Party, while retaining the right to examine, criticise and\r\nwarn. This was not purely an act of self-sacrifice. In fact Sinn Fein was\r\nnever at so low an ebb. While the country was drifting farther and farther\r\nin the direction of Home Rule, Sinn Fein was insisting more and more upon\r\nfirst principles. Its official attitude of warm approval of the work of\r\nthe Gaelic League was exchanged for one of insistence upon the urgency of\r\nmaking Irish the national language. \"We must begin again,\" said _Sinn\r\nFein_, \"to be an Irish-speaking people, or there can be no future of\r\nnational independence before us.\" With England on the one hand and America\r\non the other, 120,000,000 people speaking English, the danger to the\r\nlanguage was imminent. \"We freely admit,\" it proceeded, \"that this\r\nconclusion is not one we sought nor one we desired. The conviction has\r\nforced itself upon us and has been with some reluctance accepted by us.\"\r\nAnd it continued to speak plain language about the Home Rule which now\r\nseemed inevitable: \"No scheme which the English Parliament may pass in the\r\nnear future will satisfy Sinn Fein--no legislature created in Ireland\r\nwhich is not supreme and absolute will offer a basis for concluding a\r\nfinal settlement with the foreigners who usurp the government of this\r\ncountry. But any measure which gives genuine, if even partial, control of\r\ntheir own affairs to Irishmen shall meet with no opposition from us and\r\nshould meet with no opposition from any section of Irishmen.\" So far was\r\nSinn Fein at this time from any desire to do more than infuse a new spirit\r\ninto Irishmen, favourable to the eventual future development of the policy\r\noutlined by the National Council, that it expressly disclaimed the title\r\nof a party. \"It is not our business,\" was the conclusion of a pamphlet\r\nissued by the Belfast Branch of Sinn Fein, \"to make one more party among\r\nthe political parties of Ireland, nor to carry on a party propaganda nor\r\nto waste time quarrelling with any political party. Above the cries of\r\ncontending parties we raise the cry of Ireland and Irish independence--an\r\nindependence in the gaining of which Catholic and Protestant will be\r\nshoulder comrades as they were a century ago, and in the advantages of\r\nwhich they will be equal sharers. Not an Ireland for a class or a creed,\r\nbut an Ireland for the Irish, and the whole of the Irish, not an Ireland\r\nfettered and trammelled by England, but mistress of her own destinies,\r\nevolving her own national life and building for herself an ever-increasing\r\nprosperity. We can leave the past with its bitter memories, its bigotries\r\nand its feuds to those whose property it is, the reactionaries who here,\r\nas in every country, would stem the tide of national advancement. We have\r\nto recognise the nation, rather than parties within the nation; for it is\r\ngreater than any party, and in the service of the nation all men have an\r\nequal right as well as an equal duty.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSINN FEIN AND THE REPUBLICANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom 1910 to 1913 the Sinn Fein movement was practically moribund.\r\nPolitical attention in Ireland was largely centred on the fate of Home\r\nRule and the tactics of the Irish Party at Westminster or the struggles of\r\nthe Party at home with Mr. William O'Brien and the All-for-Ireland League.\r\nThe Constitution which Ireland might enjoy in 1914 was of more pressing\r\ninterest than the merits of the Constitution of 1782.\r\n\r\nBut there were other forces at work in Ireland in opposition to the two\r\nofficial parties of Unionists and Nationalists. There were in the first\r\nplace the survivors of the Fenians, the Irish Republican Brotherhood,\r\nwhose ideal was an Irish Republic, independent of any connection with\r\nEngland or indeed with any other country. Fenianism had become to all\r\noutward appearance practically dead in Ireland. It had suffered, in the\r\nopinion of some at least of its members, from the fact that it had put\r\nrevolutionary action first and the preaching of republicanism second. As\r\none of them wrote afterwards, \"The Fenian propagandist work in the sixties\r\nwas entirely separatist with practically no reference to Republicanism.\r\nRightly or wrongly I have always held the view that the absence of the\r\ndeeper Republican thought amongst our people accounted for a considerable\r\namount of the falling away after '67.\" The people whose republican\r\nsentiments were weak \"dropped back into the easier path leading only to a\r\nmuch modified national independence.\" Accordingly after 1867 the Fenians\r\nattempted to make republicanism an essential part of their propaganda.\r\nThere had been a large number of Protestant Irishmen among the Fenians,\r\nand, as Republican sentiment had been traditional in Ulster since the days\r\nof the United Irishmen, it seemed that a movement aiming at an Irish\r\nRepublic might have more chance of success among Ulster Protestants than\r\nany form of \"Home Rule.\" Besides, the \"New Departure,\" the alliance of\r\nFenianism with Parnell in the Land War, had weakened the movement still\r\nmore. \"It was disastrous,\" says the same authority, \"to the Fenian\r\nmovement as such, but it drove the Land League through to a degree that no\r\nreally constitutional movement could ever have reached.\" In allying itself\r\nto some extent with Parnell, in abandoning for the time in his interests\r\nits revolutionary propaganda, it seemed to have weakened its own moral\r\nforce, while it did not succeed in winning even Home Rule. And the fact of\r\nits being of necessity a secret society brought it under the ban of the\r\nChurch. Fear of ecclesiastical censure most often kept young Irishmen out\r\nof Fenianism. It was not enough for the Fenians to say, as they did, that\r\nto the existence of a secret society whose aims were lawful there was no\r\nmoral or theological objection. The experts in morals and theology said\r\nthat there was, and their word, and not that of the Fenians, was accepted\r\non the whole as final. And the actions of the Invincibles during the\r\nParnellite struggle had gravely compromised not Parnell only but the\r\nFenian Party, to which they were supposed to belong. As a matter of fact\r\nthe Irish Republican Brotherhood had nothing to do with them. It had no\r\nsympathy with, nor reliance on, their policy of political assassination. A\r\nmember of the Brotherhood who joined the Invincibles was regarded as\r\nhaving broken his oath to its members and its constitution. But this was\r\nnot generally believed, any more than Parnell's statement that he had been\r\nno party to the brutal murder of Lord Frederick Cavendish; and the\r\nprestige of Fenianism was lowered. Still, the Irish Republican Brotherhood\r\nwas in existence as a centre of separatist and republican thought and the\r\nimminence of Home Rule could not but stimulate its interest. Its members\r\nmust either decide to lend their support to Mr. Redmond as it had once\r\nbeen lent to Parnell, or to come out, whether openly or in private, as his\r\nopponents.\r\n\r\nThe Irish Republican Brotherhood was not the only centre of republican\r\nthought in Ireland. In 1896 the Irish Socialist Republican Party had been\r\nfounded in Dublin by James Connolly, the ablest organizer and writer which\r\nIrish Labour has yet produced. Under his editorship _The Workers'\r\nRepublic_ became an organ of Socialism and Republicanism in their\r\napplication to Irish conditions. The new party took its part in Irish\r\npolitical activities. It joined the movement to commemorate the Rebellion\r\nof 1798, the work of the United Irishmen whose political creed had been\r\nrepublican. Along with other Irish Nationalists it joined in the work of\r\nthe Irish Transvaal Committee and helped to organize and equip the Irish\r\nBrigade which fought on the side of the South African Republics. But till\r\nafter the General Election of 1910 it made no attempt to enter Irish\r\npolitics as an independent party. It remained in its constitution a purely\r\ntrade union party though sympathetic with, and ready to lend its aid in,\r\nthe Irish national movement. In 1911 the proposal to found a combined\r\npolitical and industrial movement was defeated by only three votes at the\r\nCongress held at Galway, and in the following year the Clonmel Congress\r\ndecided to found \"an Irish Labour Party independent of all other parties\r\nin the country, in order that the organized workers might be able to enter\r\nthe proposed Irish Parliament as an organized Labour Party upon the\r\npolitical field.\" Though the Irish Labour Party was not professedly\r\nrepublican, and though its political activities were confined for the time\r\nto the enforcement of the political interests of Irish Labour, yet the\r\nleaders and a considerable number of the rank and file were undoubtedly\r\nrepublican in their aims and sympathies.\r\n\r\nThe Irish Labour Party had need, in truth, to be independent of all\r\nexisting political parties in Ireland. The Ulster Unionist Party was\r\ndefinitely and irrevocably committed to the Conservative and capitalist\r\nprogramme. It would as soon have admitted to its ranks a professed\r\ndynamitard as a professed socialist (whatever his views might have been on\r\nthe subject of the Legislative Union). On Socialism the Church could not\r\nbe expected to smile (and did not smile) and its attitude determined that\r\nof the Irish Parliamentary Party. The Party was in a delicate position: it\r\ncould not say a word against Socialism for fear of offending the English\r\nLabour Party, whose votes were required in the parliamentary struggle: it\r\ncould not say a word in favour of it for fear of offending the Church. It\r\nwas sitting upon a razor's edge and a word too much in either direction\r\nmight easily disturb its balance. So it voted steadily, manfully and\r\nsilently for Labour measures in England and left its action to the\r\ncountry. In the frame-work of the Sinn Fein programme there was no place\r\nfor Labour. Among all its plans for the relief of Ireland from the evils\r\nof the English connection there was none for the relief of the evils of\r\nwhich the workers complained. Its official organ was against strikes, and\r\neven considered that the connection of Irish with English Labour was an\r\nact of treachery to the country. Some of the most pungent criticism to\r\nwhich the party was subjected came from the paper founded in 1911 by James\r\nLarkin, _The Irish Worker and People's Advocate_. In its first number, the\r\neditor defined his attitude to the O'Brienites, the Irish Parliamentary\r\nParty and Sinn Fein. He described the last as a \"party or rump which,\r\nwhile pretending to be Irish of the Irish, insults the nation by trying\r\nto foist on it not only imported economics based on false principles, but\r\nwhich had the temerity to advocate the introduction of foreign capitalists\r\ninto this sorely exploited country.\" \"Their chief appeal\" (he goes on) \"to\r\nthe foreign capitalists was that they (the imported capitalists) would\r\nhave freedom to employ cheap Irish labour.... For eleven years these\r\nself-appointed prophets and seers have led their army up the hill and led\r\nthem down again, and would continue to so lead them, if allowed, until the\r\nleader was appointed King of Ireland under the Constitution of 1782.\"\r\n\r\nThe definitely Republican movement found an organ of expression in the\r\nautumn of 1910 by the establishment of _Saoirseacht na h-Eireann, Irish\r\nFreedom_, a fortnightly paper of eight pages, under the management of\r\nSeaghan MacDiarmada. Its motto was a quotation from Wolfe Tone: \"To\r\nsubvert the tyranny of our execrable Government, to break the connection\r\nwith England, the never-failing source of all our political evils and to\r\nassert the independence of my country--these were my objects.\" Its policy\r\nwas explained at length in its editorial: \"We believe that free political\r\ninstitutions are an absolute essential for the future security and\r\ndevelopment of the Irish people and, therefore, we seek to establish free\r\npolitical institutions in this country; and in this we wish not to be the\r\norgan of any party, but the organ of an uncompromising Nationalism. We\r\nstand not for an Irish party but for National tradition--the tradition of\r\nWolfe Tone and Robert Emmet, of John Mitchel and John O'Leary. Like them\r\nwe believe in and would work for the independence of Ireland--and we use\r\nthe term with no reservation stated or implied; we stand for the complete\r\nand total separation of Ireland from England and the establishment of an\r\nIrish Government, untrammelled and uncontrolled by any other Government in\r\nthe world. Like them we stand for an Irish Republic--for, as Thomas Devin\r\nReilly said in 1848, 'Freedom can take but one shape amongst us--a\r\nRepublic.'\"\r\n\r\nThe attitude of this new republican movement to that of the previous Sinn\r\nFein movement is clearly defined in a subsequent leader. \"The temporary\r\nsuspension of the Sinn Fein movement is often cited as a throwback but it\r\nis nothing of the kind. Under whatever name we propagate our ideas the\r\nIrish Nation must be built on Sinn Fein principles, or non-recognition of\r\nBritish authority, law, justice or legislature: that is our basis and the\r\nprinciples of the Sinn Fein policy are as sound to-day as ever they were.\r\nThe movement is temporarily suspended because some of its leaders directed\r\nit into an '82 movement, thinking they could collar the middle-classes and\r\ndrop the separatists; but when the separatists were dropped there was no\r\nmovement left.\"\r\n\r\nThe new movement was in fact an attempt to rehabilitate and re-establish\r\nthe Sinn Fein movement by making it definitely republican while adhering\r\nto the main lines of the policy by which Sinn Fein hoped to succeed. But\r\nthe original Sinn Fein continued on its way. Its paper continued to be\r\npublished and to find readers. It was unrepentant with regard to its\r\npolitical aims: \"We do not care a fig for republicanism as republicanism,\"\r\nsaid _Sinn Fein_ two years later; but from the winter of 1910 dates the\r\nmovement which eventually drove out of Sinn Fein the idea of the\r\nre-establishment of the King, Lords and Commons of Ireland under the\r\nConstitution of 1782 and replaced it by that of an Irish Republic.\r\n\r\nThe new movement was the direct outcome of the Wolfe Tone Clubs. It was\r\nthey who carried out all the work entailed by the publication of _Irish\r\nFreedom_. These clubs had just been founded \"to propagate the principles\r\nand disseminate the teachings of Theobald Wolfe Tone and the other true\r\nIrishmen who in 1798, 1803, 1848 and 1867 strove for the complete\r\nindependence of Ireland; to encourage the union of Irishmen of all creeds\r\nand sections in working for the freedom of their country; to promote the\r\nadvancement of national thought and inculcate the spirit of self-sacrifice\r\nand self-reliance by which alone true liberty can be attained.\" The\r\nmembers pledged themselves to substitute the common name of Irishman for\r\nthat of Catholic or Protestant; no person serving in the armed forces of\r\nEngland was eligible for membership.\r\n\r\nThis new branch of the Sinn Fein movement attempted to do what the old\r\nSinn Fein had not as yet done, get into direct touch with labour\r\nquestions and the labour movement, though perhaps not very successfully.\r\nThe first number of _Irish Freedom_ had an article on sweated industries,\r\npointing out that though Nationalists talked as if Belfast were the only\r\nplace in Ireland where workers were underpaid, many Nationalists were open\r\nto the same reproach. It pointed out the duty of the universities in the\r\nmatter, pleading for a really scientific study of Irish economic problems,\r\nincluding (besides the wages system) such questions as the working of the\r\nLand Acts, Co-operation, the conditions of the Congested Districts. It\r\nwelcomed with enthusiasm the Co-operative Movement. \"The co-operative\r\nspirit,\" it said, \"is perhaps the greatest asset in modern Ireland and it\r\nwill require a stronger flame than the speeches of political firebrands to\r\nmelt it away.\" On the occasion of the strikes in Belfast, Dublin, Cork and\r\nother towns in 1911 it took sides with the strikers, in marked contrast to\r\nMr. Griffith's _Sinn Fein_, which preached something approaching \"abject\r\nsurrender\" on the part of the workers. It induced Mr. George Russell to\r\ncontribute an article on the Co-operative Commonwealth. This undoubtedly\r\nwent a certain way to bring about a friendlier feeling on the part of\r\nLabour towards Sinn Fein, but it was long before the attitude of strict\r\nSinn Feiners was forgotten by the workers. Its attitude towards Ulster was\r\nmore outspoken and definite. In 1910 the objection of Ulster to the\r\napproaching Home Rule policy of the Liberals began to harden into a\r\nthreat of extreme militancy. A section of Ulster Unionists announced their\r\nintention not to submit under any circumstances to the Home Rule Bill even\r\nif it should become law and receive the Royal assent. To the Republicans\r\nthis seemed \"tantamount to an admission of the whole Irish case for\r\nself-government. If it means anything it means that Ireland, north as well\r\nas south of the Boyne, refuses to recognize any inherent right of the\r\nelectors of Great Britain to decide how it shall be governed.\" The\r\njustness of this appreciation of the Ulster position must be examined\r\nlater: but, true or false, it is characteristic of the attitude which the\r\nwhole Sinn Fein Party was afterwards to take. But the Ulstermen coupled\r\nwith their attitude towards the Liberal Party and its doings a truculent\r\ndefiance of all Catholic Ireland. The cause of this hostility the\r\nRepublicans found in the attitude of the Parliamentary Party. While that\r\nparty was in the height of its success \"no attempt was made to understand\r\ntheir [_i.e._ the Ulster Protestants'] attitude or grapple with problems\r\nthat appealed to them, and the economic grievances of Belfast workers were\r\nregarded as their own affair, not as the business of men who professed to\r\nrepresent the Irish people as a whole. The prevailing idea seemed to be\r\nthat they should be left to stew in their own juice, and if they did not\r\nfall in with whatever scheme the Liberals carried through the English\r\nParliament that they should be, in the phrase of a prominent\r\nparliamentarian, which has never been forgotten, 'overborne by the strong\r\nhand.'... The party of the future must make the conversion of Ulster the\r\nfirst plank in their platform and recognize that a national settlement\r\nfrom which Ulster dissented would not be worth winning.\" In the Ancient\r\nOrder of Hibernians, all sections of Sinn Fein as well as the Labour Party\r\nsaw a menace to any prospect of an accommodation with Ulster. This\r\nstrictly sectarian society, as sectarian and often as violent in its\r\nmethods as the Orange Lodges, evoked their determined hostility. \"This\r\nnarrowing down,\" wrote _Irish Freedom_, \"of Nationalism to the members of\r\none creed is the most fatal thing that has taken place in Irish politics\r\nsince the days of the Pope's Brass Band.... That the driving power of the\r\nofficial Nationalists should be supplied by an organization of which no\r\nProtestant, however good a patriot, can be a member, is in direct\r\nopposition to the policy and traditions of Irish Nationalism.\" The Ancient\r\nOrder was described as \"a job-getting and job-cornering organization,\" as\r\n\"a silent practical rivetting of sectarianism on the nation.\" The _Irish\r\nWorker_ was equally emphatic. \"Were it not for the existence of the Board\r\nof Erin, the Orange Society would have long since ceased to exist.... To\r\nBrother Devlin and not to Brother Carson is mainly due the progress of the\r\nCovenanter movement in Ulster.\"\r\n\r\nDevoted to the cause of an independent Irish Republic and of the union of\r\nIrishmen without distinction of creed under one national banner, the\r\ncause of Wolfe Tone, the movement attracted idealists who had so far held\r\naloof from the older, non-republican, form of Sinn Fein. Chief among these\r\nwere P. H. Pearse and Thomas MacDonagh, both poets and men of fine\r\nliterary gifts, both regarded with affection for their high and\r\ndisinterested devotion to the cause of Ireland. And in accordance with\r\nIrish Republican tradition it took up an attitude with regard to armed\r\nrevolution somewhat different from that of Sinn Fein. While the latter\r\nheld that in the present state of Ireland an armed revolution was\r\nimpracticable, the Republicans, though not directly advising it, held that\r\nit had a reasonable prospect of success if England should become involved\r\nin a European War. Some Irish revolutionists who had so far held aloof\r\nfrom all political parties were encouraged by this to join the republican\r\nbranch of Sinn Fein and try to infuse into it a more determined\r\nrevolutionary spirit.\r\n\r\nThe Labour Party, whose opinions were expressed by the _The Irish Worker\r\nand People's Advocate_, adopted a similar attitude. Their motto was the\r\nphrase of Fintan Lalor: \"The principle I state and mean to stand upon is\r\nthis--that the entire ownership of Ireland, moral and material, up to the\r\nsun and down to the centre, is vested in the people of Ireland.\" Their own\r\nlanguage was equally explicit: \"By Freedom we mean that we Irishmen in\r\nIreland shall be free to govern this land called Ireland by Irish people\r\nin the interest of all the Irish people; that no other people or peoples,\r\nno matter what they call themselves, or from whence they come, now or in\r\nthe future, have any claim to interfere with the common right of the\r\ncommon people of this land of Ireland to work out their own destiny. We\r\nowe no allegiance to any other nation, nor the king, governors or\r\nrepresentatives of any other nation.\" In spite of the criticism that a\r\npurely Labour movement should confine itself to Labour questions, and\r\nleave the broader political issues to the one side, _The Irish Worker_\r\ndeclared for an independent Irish Republic: \"We know,\" it said, \"that\r\nuntil the workers of Ireland obtain possession of the land of Ireland and\r\nmake their own laws they can only hope for and obtain partial improvement\r\nof their conditions. We ask no more than our rights: we will be content\r\nwith no less.\" The desire for a \"free independent nation, enjoying a true\r\nRepublican freedom\" linked the Labour Party to the republican branch of\r\nSinn Fein, but on other questions there was much disagreement. The\r\nattitude of Arthur Griffith to the Wexford Strike in 1911 was the subject\r\nof bitter comment. The Young Republicans, who objected to English Trade\r\nUnions sending \"English money\" to finance the Irish strikers, were bluntly\r\ntold to mind their own business: the Gaelic League, which encouraged Irish\r\nmanufactures, was said to have failed in its duty by taking no account of\r\nthe conditions under which they were manufactured, or of the wages paid to\r\nthe workers who made them: \"the revival of the Irish language is a\r\ndesirable ambition and has our whole-hearted support; but the abolition of\r\ndestitution, disease and the conditions that cause them are even more\r\nnecessary and urgent. What is the use of bilingualism to a dead man?\"\r\n\r\nBut however they might differ on minor points, both of these new parties,\r\nthe Independent Labour Party of Ireland and the Young Republican Party,\r\nwere at one with each other and with Sinn Fein in opposition to the\r\nParliamentary Party. It was pointed out that in the twenty-one years which\r\nhad elapsed since the death of Parnell his policy of \"blocking the way to\r\nEnglish legislation until Ireland was accorded self-government\" had been\r\nabandoned without any other definite policy being substituted for it: that\r\nduring ten of those years an English party, professing sympathy with\r\nIreland, had been kept in office by the Irish vote: that Home Rule was\r\nstill in the future and the principles governing the expected measure\r\nstill undetermined. In March, 1912, the Executive of Sinn Fein resolved\r\nunanimously: \"That this Executive earnestly hopes that the promised Home\r\nRule Bill will be one that may be accepted as a genuine measure of reform\r\nby the people of Ireland and that it may speedily become law. Should the\r\nBill, on the contrary, be rejected as unsatisfactory by the people of\r\nIreland, or should it, though satisfactory, fail to become law--which we\r\nwould deplore--the organization is prepared to lead the country by other\r\nand effective methods to the attainment of self-government.\" In reporting\r\nthis resolution _Sinn Fein_ wrote, in words which at the time seemed to\r\nmany supporters of the Party offensive, but which now seem charged with\r\nportent: \"No new parliamentarian movement will be permitted unopposed to\r\nbuild upon the ruins of that which goes down with a sham Home Rule\r\nmeasure. To make this clear before the Home Rule measure be introduced is\r\nthe last service we can render the Parliamentary Party. They have had the\r\nGovernment 'in the hollow of their hands' for years--they have removed the\r\nHouse of Lords from their path--there is nothing to prevent the Liberal\r\nGovernment introducing and passing a full measure of Home Rule save and\r\nexcept its enmity to Ireland. With a majority of over 100 and the Lords'\r\nveto removed the fullest measure of Home Rule can be passed in two years.\r\nIt is the business of the Parliamentary Party to have it passed or to\r\nleave the stage to those who are in earnest.\"\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the text of the Bill was not reassuring even to those\r\nadvocates of Irish independence who were willing to take a measure of Home\r\nRule as an instalment. The financial provisions of the Bill met with\r\nsevere and justified criticism. In spite of the fact that Ireland had been\r\nsystematically over-taxed for a century, and that a Parliamentary\r\nCommission had so reported nearly twenty years earlier, the financial\r\nprovision for the proposed Irish Parliament could only be described as\r\nbeggarly. And almost everything that really mattered in the government of\r\nIreland was withdrawn from the competence of the Irish Parliament. It was\r\ndescribed in mockery as a \"Gas and Water Bill,\" and even convinced\r\nsupporters of the Parliamentary Party had their qualms in declaring their\r\nacceptance of the measure. There was no dubiety about the verdict of the\r\nNationalist organizations opposed to Mr. Redmond. _The Worker's Republic_\r\nwas outspoken in the extreme: it complained that the Bill had been\r\nextorted from the Liberals \"by whining and apologizing\": in an Open Letter\r\nto the United Irish League of Great Britain, it said, \"You are told that\r\nthe people of Ireland accepted the Bill as a full and complete recognition\r\nof our claim as Irishmen. That is a lie ... a Bill, which is the rottenest\r\nbargain ever made by a victorious people with a mean, pettifogging,\r\ndespised Government.\" \"A beggar,\" it wrote again, \"gets only crumbs and\r\nwe, Irish workers, want a country.\" The verdict of _Irish Freedom_ was\r\nequally emphatic; it was summed up in the phrase, \"Damn your concessions;\r\nwe want our country.\"\r\n\r\nBut whatever individual Irish Members of Parliament may have thought of\r\nthe Bill, the Party was as a whole committed to it. No one in Ireland knew\r\nwhat negotiations, barterings, and bargains preceded the actual drafting\r\nof the measure: what the difficulties and objections were which had to be\r\nmet by Mr. Redmond: in how far he had offered concessions, in how far they\r\nhad been forced upon him. They only knew that he was prepared to support\r\nthe resulting Bill and that the resulting Bill was less than they had been\r\nled to expect. There was little open discussion of principles, criticism\r\nwas not relished or welcomed. The Party had done its best for the country\r\nand the country was now called upon to back the Party. A bargain had been\r\nmade by the representatives of the Irish people and the Irish people were\r\nexpected to stand by the consequences. Under other circumstances this\r\nappeal would have been accepted, but it was no answer to the complaint\r\nthat the Irish representatives had not been empowered to abandon in\r\nexpress words every national claim that went beyond those satisfied by the\r\nprovisions of the Home Rule Bill. This was the kernel of the dispute\r\nbetween the Party and the Nationalists who opposed them. It seemed as if\r\nby the deliberate renunciation of any desire or intention to claim for\r\nIreland anything more than the status of a dependency of Great Britain,\r\ndeprived forever (so far as an act of legislation could deprive her) of\r\nher immemorial claim to be an independent nation, the Party had betrayed\r\nthe national demand and sold the national honour. But the Party did not\r\nsee (or betrayed no sign of having seen) the relevance of the criticism;\r\nand certainly they miscalculated the strength of the opposition which was\r\ngathering in the country. In the face of Ulster's attitude, they\r\nconfidently expected the whole country to rally to their support. And,\r\nafter all, what could, or would, the dissentients do about it? Sinn Fein\r\ncontinued loudly to proclaim its policy of opposition to the use of\r\nforce. It was all very well to say \"Sinn Fein is the policy of to-morrow.\r\nIf Ireland be again deceived as to Home Rule, she has no other policy to\r\nfall back upon\"; but the same article (December, 1912) contained the\r\nwords: \"The great offence of Sinn Fein indeed in the eyes of its opponents\r\nis that it does not urge an untrained and unequipped country to futile\r\ninsurrection.\" If Sinn Fein then would only talk, and the only place to\r\ntalk to the purpose was the House of Commons, what was there to prevent\r\nHome Rule from being an accomplished fact \"in the not far distant future?\"\r\nUlster supplied the answer, not for itself only, but for the rest of\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VOLUNTEER MOVEMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe genius of Ulster (perhaps through some happy combination of primitive\r\nstocks) has always been practical and militant. It was the last Irish\r\nprovince to submit to English rule. The Celtic population which survived\r\nthe clearances and the plantings has exercised upon planters and settlers\r\nthe ancient charm of the Celtic stock and made them, in spite of\r\nthemselves, _ipsis Hibernis Hiberniores_. The O'Neills were the most\r\nformidable antagonists whom the invaders encountered in Ireland. They made\r\nthe last great stand for national independence. When Owen Roe O'Neill died\r\nthe Irish nation was, in the words of Davis, \"sheep without a shepherd\r\nwhen the snow shuts out the sky\" and the flight of the Earls was the sign\r\nthat the resistance of Ireland was over with the resistance of Ulster. In\r\nlater times and under changed conditions Ulster retained the prerogative\r\nof leadership. The Volunteers who forced the Constitution of 1782 were\r\nlargely Ulstermen; the leaders of the United Irishmen were to be found in\r\nUlster and the compact of their Union was sealed on the mountain that\r\nrises above Belfast. John Mitchel, who led the Young Irelanders in action\r\nas Davis was their master in thought, was the son of an Ulster\r\nPresbyterian minister. Other Irishmen may have excelled in literature and\r\nthe arts, have voiced more eloquently the aspirations of their country or\r\nsung with more pathos of its fall, but the bent of Ulster has been on the\r\nwhole towards action and movement. The heart and brain of Ireland may beat\r\nand think elsewhere, but Ulster is its right arm. Ireland is proud of\r\nUlster. Under an unnatural and vicious system of government they have\r\nquarrelled; but if Ulster were reconciled to Ireland Ulster might lead it\r\nwhere it chose.\r\n\r\nOn the question of the Home Rule Bill Ulster was almost equally divided.\r\nThe majority of the Ulster Protestants were against it, though a minority,\r\namong whom traditions of Protestant Nationalism had survived the sordid\r\nbigotries fostered for a century, were strongly in its favour; the\r\nmajority of the Catholic population were in favour of it. Among the\r\nNationalists there was a minority who professed the creed of Sinn Fein and\r\nof Republicanism: late in 1913 a branch of the Young Republican Party in\r\nBelfast, composed of Gaelic Leaguers, members of Freedom Clubs and Trades\r\nUnionists unfurled its banner of an orange sunburst on a green ground with\r\nthe motto in white, \"Young Republican Party--Dia agus an Pobul,\" and there\r\nhad been branches of Sinn Fein established in Ulster some years earlier;\r\nbut on the whole the Ulster Nationalists supported the Parliamentary\r\nParty. No geographical or ethnological line of political demarcation could\r\nbe drawn. There was no district in Ulster which was not politically\r\ndivided: there was no stock in Ulster which had not members in both\r\npolitical camps. Some of the most outspoken and vehement of the Unionist\r\nParty bore, and were proud of, purely Irish names; many of the\r\nNationalists were the bearers of names introduced into Ireland with the\r\nplanters sent by King James. The settled policy of the Act of the Union\r\nhad done its work with almost complete success. The Protestant had learned\r\nto regard the connection with England as essential to the maintenance of\r\nhis religious and civil freedom: he believed not only that the Roman\r\nCatholic Church was officially intolerant, but that all Roman Catholics\r\nwere, as a matter of fact, intolerant in conduct and in practice, and\r\nincapable of being anything else. And Irish Catholics seemed to him to be\r\npeculiarly susceptible to the intolerant influences of their\r\necclesiastical leaders. When the views of the Catholic Hierarchy in\r\nIreland and those of Irish Nationalists coincided he saw in their\r\nagreement the triumph of the \"priest in politics\": when they differed he\r\nwas either at a loss to account for an occurrence so far removed from the\r\nsettled habits of nature or saw in it an obscure but interesting symptom\r\nof a fear of Home Rule on the part of the Hierarchy, a fear that Home Rule\r\nmight jeopardise their own predominance. But not even the supposed\r\nhesitations of the Hierarchy could reconcile him to the prospect of a Home\r\nRule under which the electoral majority would be \"priest-ridden.\" Unkind\r\ncritics might have urged that people whose whole political outlook was\r\nhag-ridden by the phantoms of popes and priests were not in a position to\r\ncall those \"priest-ridden\" who at any rate sometimes differed sharply from\r\ntheir clergy in political and civil affairs; but the Ulster Protestant was\r\nproof against mere logical quibbles and rhetorical retorts. He had done\r\nhis thinking about politics with the Act of Union: he had taken his stand:\r\nhe was careless of taunts, cajolery and threats: let those meddle with him\r\nwho dared. He spurned the allegation of intolerance, but he was intolerant\r\nwithout knowing it and (to do him justice) for reasons which, had they\r\ncorresponded with the facts, would have been sound. An Ireland under\r\necclesiastical despotism, whether Protestant or Catholic, would be no\r\nplace for a man to live in, and to exchange the Legislative Union with\r\nEngland for a legislative union with Rome would indeed be a disastrous\r\nbargain. As a matter of fact, had the Ulster Protestant realized it, there\r\nwas no fear of any such result. In the Irish Catholic mind there was\r\nclearly defined the limit of the sphere in which the Church was supreme.\r\nThat sphere was much larger than the restricted area within which the\r\nProtestant allowed his Church to legislate at its ease: but it was subject\r\nto limitations all the same. And it was growing narrower and narrower.\r\nIndividual ecclesiastics may have roamed at large (and did roam at large)\r\nover the whole sphere of human activities: individual priests made\r\nmonstrous claims upon the submission of their flocks in matters with\r\nwhich they had no kind of concern. The intense devotion to their religion\r\nwhich marks Catholic Irishmen, the respect which they feel for the\r\npriesthood which stood by them in dark and evil days, had induced a spirit\r\nof patience in submission to claims which could not be substantiated. But\r\nwith the revival of interest in political thought the position was\r\nchanging. The battle for political freedom of thought and action which the\r\nFenians had fought had its result. Ecclesiastical claims in civil matters\r\nwere subject to a close scrutiny. The Gaelic League had more than once\r\nasserted with success its claim to be free in its own sphere from any kind\r\nof ecclesiastical dictation, and in every instance the people of Ireland\r\nhas taken its side. The attempt of the Roman Curia to interfere with the\r\nsubscription to the Parnell testimonial had been an ignominious failure;\r\nand the boast of an Irish leader that he would as soon take his politics\r\nfrom Constantinople as from Rome was generally acknowledged to be sound as\r\na statement of theory. But there were still instances enough of impossible\r\nclaims on the part of the ecclesiastical authorities to afford the Ulster\r\nProtestant a good _prima facie_ brief against Home Rule.\r\n\r\nAllied to the fear of the \"priest in politics\" was the fear that under\r\nHome Rule every position in Ireland worth speaking of would be given to\r\nRoman Catholics and that Protestants would be systematically and\r\nruthlessly excluded. This was an apprehension very difficult to deal with\r\nbecause the real grounds of it were seldom openly expressed. These grounds\r\nwere first, the consciousness that Irish Catholics had been for\r\ngenerations systematically excluded from all posts that were in the gift\r\nof Irish Protestants and the consequent probability that reprisals would\r\nbe called for and taken; second, the innate conviction, born of\r\ngenerations of religious controversy and suspicion, that Catholics were\r\n\"not to be trusted,\" that, whatever they said to the contrary, they were\r\ncertain to act harshly towards Protestants, and that the accession to\r\npower in Ireland of a permanent Catholic majority would mean persecution\r\nin matters of religion and corruption in matters of administration. This\r\nposition was fortified by a set of arguments, crude in themselves, but\r\nless crude than the convictions that required to employ them. It was\r\npointed out that Irish Catholics, being deprived for generations of\r\nacceptable opportunities of higher education, and of practically all\r\nopportunities of administrative experience, could not be expected to have\r\nthe necessary qualifications for the posts to which they were certain to\r\nbe appointed: that this was not their fault (it certainly was not) but\r\nthat, facts being facts, reasonable persons must take account of them and\r\nframe their attitude in accordance with them. It may seem strange that all\r\nthis was called \"adherence to the principles of civil and religious\r\nliberty,\" that persons calling for religious toleration in the abstract\r\nshould refuse to practise it in any number of given cases: but though\r\nthere was a certain amount of conscious artifice in the use of words,\r\narising from a dim feeling that the profession of tolerant and liberal\r\nsentiments was more likely to arouse outside sympathy than a blunt\r\nstatement of religious prejudice, there was, after all, the idea that the\r\nonly way to preserve civil and religious liberty in Ireland for anybody\r\nwas to curtail its exercise in practice by the Roman Catholic and\r\nNationalist portion of the country. It was easy for Catholics to point to\r\nthe number of Protestants who had been honoured and trusted leaders of the\r\nnational movement, to the friendly terms upon which Protestants and\r\nCatholics for the most part lived together in the South and West of\r\nIreland, to the Protestants who had been appointed to positions of trust\r\nand profit under boards and in institutions managed by Irish Catholics.\r\nThe answer was that such Protestants either were the only persons who\r\ncould be trusted to perform the duties of their position or had proved\r\n\"accommodating\" enough to suit, or that their appointment was part of a\r\ndeep-laid plan to conceal the real feeling of Catholics to Protestants\r\nuntil such time as, the bait being taken, Protestants would confide in\r\ntheir enemies and hand themselves over to their mercies.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that no line of argument would have dispelled feelings such\r\nas these; and there does not seem to be in fact any possibility of\r\ndispelling them by mere professions of friendliness, or by any other means\r\nthan an experience to the contrary which can build up gradually an\r\nopposite conviction.\r\n\r\nThe religious difficulty was the root difficulty in Ulster with regard to\r\nHome Rule. If it had been removed or removable the rest would have been\r\neasy; but it was not the only difficulty. There was the fear, widely held\r\nby the Belfast merchants and manufacturers, that a Home Rule Parliament\r\nwould ruin their industries: directly by means of taxation and indirectly\r\nby public mismanagement. It was held that an Irish Parliament could not\r\n\"pay its way\" without the imposition of extra taxation, and that no source\r\nof profitable taxation was to be found in Ireland save and except the\r\nprosperous industries of the North. In the second place, it was believed\r\nthat, Ireland being largely agricultural, the new Parliament would\r\nrepresent a predominantly agricultural interest and that its legislation\r\nmight be expected to fail to take into account the industrial interests of\r\nthe country, mainly represented in the North. Again, an untried Parliament\r\nwould for a time be almost certainly guilty of mismanagement and\r\nincapacity from which the business interests of the North would be sure to\r\nsuffer.\r\n\r\nLastly, the strong \"British\" sentiment of Ulster barred the way to any\r\nweakening of the tie uniting Ireland to Great Britain. This feeling,\r\namounting at times almost to the consciousness of a secondary nationality,\r\nfound expression in the theory that Protestant Ulster was a separate\r\n\"nation.\" But though the expression of the theory was often absurd, the\r\nfeeling which underlay it was genuine. It had not been always there: it\r\nwas liable to disappear under the stress of stronger feelings: it had been\r\nsubject to revulsions. When the Irish Church Act was passed, the Grand\r\nOrange Lodge of Ireland, the Cardinalate of Ulster Protestantism, had\r\npassed by a majority the following resolution: \"That all statements and\r\nprovisions in the objects, rules and formularies of the Orange institution\r\nwhich impose any obligation on its members to maintain the Legislative\r\nUnion between Great Britain and Ireland be expunged therefrom.\" The\r\nresolution was inoperative because a two-thirds majority was required to\r\nalter the rules: but that it could be passed is significant of the fact\r\nthat \"British\" sentiment is not the ruling sentiment in the stronghold of\r\nUlster Unionism under provocation. Still, though spasmodic and uncertain,\r\nthe feeling had to be taken into account, and in the hands of skilful\r\nmanipulators was capable of being worked into a factitious fervour.\r\n\r\nWhile Ulster Unionists were of this mind it was not to be expected that\r\nthey would acquiesce without protest in the passing of a Home Rule Act:\r\nnor was it to be expected that they would think differently because a\r\nmajority of the electors of Great Britain decided that they should. The\r\nonly people who could win them were their own countrymen. Sinn Fein saw\r\nthis clearly and in its own way tried its best to allay Protestant fears\r\nand Protestant prejudices. _Irish Freedom_ printed a letter from New York\r\nfrom an old Fenian who said, \"The great barrier to Irish success is the\r\nfear of the Protestants--unfounded and unreasonable, but undeniably\r\nthere--that their interests would be in danger in a free Ireland. Remove\r\nthat fear and the Irish question is solved. It would be of infinitely more\r\nservice to Ireland to convert ten Ulster Orangemen to Nationality by\r\nconvincing them that their interests would be safe in a free Ireland than\r\nto convince a million Englishmen that the Irish would be loyal to the\r\nking.... We had many ex-Orangemen in Fenianism.... All experience shows\r\nthat it is easier to convert an Orangeman to full nationality than to any\r\nform of Home Rule.\" But for Irish Catholics to convert Irish Orangemen to\r\nanything requires infinite tact, infinite patience, and a long lapse of\r\ntime: and it cannot be said that either the Sinn Fein or the Republican\r\nParty properly estimated the difficulty and complexity of the problem. The\r\nattempt to moderate the Ulster resistance by appeals to the principles of\r\ndemocratic government was, if possible, even less successful. It proved\r\nvain to urge that under democratic rule the will of the majority must\r\nprevail: that every party must expect to be in its turn in a minority and\r\nmust learn to take the rough with the smooth: that the very principle and\r\nobject of the Act of Union was that people in Ireland should not have the\r\nfinal say in the Government of Ireland but that the Parliament of the\r\nUnited Kingdom should decide: that both parties in Ireland had\r\nacknowledged this principle for generations and that for the Nationalists\r\nto act as the Unionists were doing now would have been denounced by the\r\nUnionists themselves as an offence against good government. Appeal was\r\nmade to Ulster in the interests of the Empire to allow Home Rule to have\r\nat least a fair trial. It was told that Englishmen were convinced that the\r\ngovernment of Ireland was radically vicious, and that the only way to\r\namend it was to entrust the internal affairs of Ireland to a strictly\r\nsubordinate Parliament: that they felt that to continue in Ireland\r\nindefinitely an indefensible system of administration was to embitter the\r\ninternal relations of the three kingdoms and weaken the Empire at the very\r\ncentre. It was pointed out that a friendly Ireland would be worth many\r\ndivisions of the Fleet and Army in the European struggle which could be\r\nseen to be approaching and the Ulster Unionists were asked to 'sacrifice'\r\nto the Empire what Parliament felt they ought no longer to retain.\r\n\r\nNeither argument nor appeal had the least effect: the argument meant\r\nnothing to them and the appeal was supposed to imply that the argument was\r\nknown to be unsound. They took their stand upon the Act of Union and\r\ndeclared that, it having once been passed, no Parliament had any right\r\nwhatever to deprive the Unionists of Ulster of \"their rights as British\r\ncitizens.\" It was, of course, perfectly clear that, Home Rule or no Home\r\nRule, everybody in the country was as much a British citizen as ever: and\r\nthe idea that Parliament could not, if it pleased, repeal the Act of Union\r\n(which, as a matter of fact, it was very far indeed from proposing to do)\r\nwas quite absurd. The fact is that all parties were at cross purposes and\r\nthat a great many politicians were using language which meant one thing to\r\nthemselves and another thing to everybody else, while a certain number\r\nwere using language which they were perfectly well aware did not express\r\nwhat they really meant. \"Loyalty to the Empire\" did not mean the same\r\nthing to the Prime Minister and to the Orange orators who held the ear of\r\nUlster; and when the latter professed sentiments of toleration and good\r\nwill to \"their Catholic fellow-countrymen\" (as they sometimes did) they\r\nmust have known that they were using words which they did not mean\r\nliterally and strictly. At the bottom of everything was the conviction\r\nthat, Protestantism being a superior kind of religion, any measure which\r\nplaced Protestants on a footing of permanent equality with Roman\r\nCatholics, a position in which Protestants would (to use a common phrase)\r\n\"pull only their own weight,\" was an offence against first principles, a\r\nmeasure to be resisted to the utmost, first by any arguments which came to\r\nhand, and in the last resort by other measures. They were \"loyal to the\r\nEmpire\" but they expected loyalty from the Empire to them: placed in\r\nIreland in a position of superiority guaranteed by the Union, they had\r\nseen the symbols of superiority one by one stripped from their shoulders.\r\nA long series of \"concessions\" to the Catholics (as successive steps in\r\nthe establishment of religious equality were described) had, it was said,\r\nleft \"the Irish\" without any \"real grievance.\" The Irish were free to\r\nvote, to buy and sell, to build their churches, to have their own schools\r\n(which the State paid for), to exercise, in short, all civil rights, with\r\nthe one restriction, that in the Parliament which legislated for their\r\ncountry they were in a permanent minority. This was the one great result,\r\nas it had been the one chief attraction, of the Union, and this it was\r\ndetermined at all hazards to retain.\r\n\r\nEverybody at the time underestimated the extent and the vigour of this\r\nfeeling, except those who shared it. Englishmen thought (when they heard\r\nof it) that it was all talk and that a \"more reasonable view would\r\neventually prevail\": they never understood that they had rivetted upon\r\nIreland a system which prevented its upholders from taking a \"reasonable\"\r\nview of anything and incapacitated them from understanding any point of\r\nview except their own. Irish Nationalists pointed to the long series of\r\ntruculent threats with which Orange Ulster had greeted every measure of\r\nIrish reform. They recalled the \"gun clubs\" which had been the answer to\r\nthe establishment of the Board of National Education: the threat to \"kick\r\nthe Queen's crown into the Boyne\" if the Irish Church Act should be\r\npassed; and they confidently expected to see a similar luxuriance of\r\ndenunciation wither before the chilling blast of an Act of Parliament.\r\nSinn Fein and the Republican Party (though they did not grasp the fact\r\nthat what the Orange Party feared was not the suppression of their\r\nreligion but the loss of its political ascendancy) adopted an attitude\r\nuseless to reconcile Ulster to Home Rule but admirably calculated, once\r\nHome Rule were passed in defiance of Ulster, to work upon its feeling of\r\nresentment at the \"betrayal\" of its interests and exploit its wounded\r\npride in the interests of the independence of Ireland.\r\n\r\nBut while Sinn Fein was making its proposals, unheeded (and indeed\r\nunheard) by those to whom they were addressed, to disarm the opposition of\r\nUlster to the cause of Irish freedom, the Ulster leaders were taking steps\r\nto adopt a policy supposed to have been abandoned in Irish politics since\r\nthe failure of the Fenian rising. The staid merchants, the prosperous\r\nprofessional classes, the sturdy farmers of Ulster, supported by the\r\nBelfast Protestant artizans, had begun to drill. Unionist Clubs were\r\nformed throughout the province: volunteers were enrolled in defiance of\r\nthe law, under the pretext of being associations formed for the purpose of\r\ntaking \"physical exercise,\" though with a growing feeling of strength and\r\nsecurity this pretext was abandoned. Talk of \"guns\" and \"cold steel\"\r\nreplaced arguments based upon economic conditions and the stringency of\r\nthe \"bonds of Empire.\" A theory of \"loyalty\" was developed compatible with\r\na chartered licence to defy the authority of King and Parliament in the\r\naffairs of the United Kingdom. As the inevitable day approached when, by\r\nthe provisions of the Parliament Act, the Royal Assent to Home Rule must\r\nbe given, the attitude of the Ulster leaders became more and more at\r\nvariance with all loyal precedents. The Ulster Volunteer Force was\r\norganized as an army for service in the field: it was provided with\r\nsignallers and despatch riders, with ambulance units and army nurses:\r\nhospitals were arranged to receive and tend the expected \"casualties\":\r\nplans were formed to seize strategic points in the province. A Provisional\r\nGovernment was constituted which on the day of the passing of the Act was\r\nto assume the government of Ulster and replace the King's Government until\r\nsuch time as it might be advisable again to restore the dispossessed\r\nmonarch to his Ulster dominions. The possibility of outside alliances was\r\nnot left to chance. The Volunteers were heartened by the news that \"the\r\ngreatest Protestant monarch\" in Europe had promised his aid: the Emperor\r\nof Germany would not stand idly by while Protestantism in Ireland was put\r\nby a British Government under the heel of Irish Catholics. Rifles were\r\nstill lacking, but they were not long in being supplied. They were\r\nimported from Hamburg and landed in Larne; and by means of a perfectly\r\nco-ordinated and admirable piece of organization distributed over Ulster\r\nwithin twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nAll Ireland, as if stunned by the shock, waited breathlessly to see what\r\nwould happen. Nothing happened. The Liberal Government, with defiance\r\nshouted in its beard, decided that, no actual breach of the \"law\" having\r\nbeen committed, no prosecutions need take place. The Cabinet was of course\r\nin a very difficult position, for it had to reckon not with the Ulster\r\nParty only but with the English Tories as well. The latter had seen from\r\nthe first the uses to which the Ulster Party might be put in the English\r\npolitical struggle. The Conservative party hoped by exploiting \"the Ulster\r\nquestion\" to bring about the downfall of the Liberal Government: and the\r\nfurther the Ulster Party went, the more thoroughly they frightened\r\nmoderate people in England by threats of bloodshed, anarchy and civil war,\r\nthe better: the more truculent the threats of armed resistance the greater\r\nthe probability that they need never be put into force. It was a dangerous\r\ngame, but danger added zest to the amusement; and Irish parties, whether\r\nUnionist or Nationalist, were to English politicians persons of\r\nunaccountable vehemence whose ways were past finding out: in any case once\r\nthey had served their turn they could quietly be shelved. The Cabinet\r\nseems to have considered that this alliance between the Ulster Party and\r\nthe English Tories at once put the breach of the conventions of politics\r\nin Ulster under a kind of sanction and ensured that extreme action would\r\nnever be taken in Ireland; for it would be absurd to assume that an\r\nEnglish party would ever consent to the wild scheme of handing over Ulster\r\ninterests to the charge of Germany; the rest would be, as it had always\r\nbeen, a matter of arrangement, of the expedients of which the Mother of\r\nParliaments was still fertile. For whatever reason, then, the Cabinet\r\ndecided to protest against the \"unprecedented outrage\" and leave the\r\nperpetrators to the judgment of posterity. But Nationalist Ireland was not\r\ninclined to see in the inaction of the Government merely the inertia of\r\nperplexed politicians waiting for an unprecedented problem to point the\r\nway to its own solution. They knew by experience that had _they_ imported\r\narms, or proclaimed their intention of doing so, or publicly flouted the\r\nmeanest of the Irish Executive the Crimes Act would have been put into\r\noperation at once and his Majesty's prisons in Ireland would have been\r\nfilled. They saw in the failure even to prosecute the Ulster leaders, to\r\nproclaim their organization, to deprive them of their arms, merely the\r\ntraditional tenderness of the British Government to its Irish \"friends.\"\r\nThey began to believe that neither English party was really sincere in\r\nanything connected with Ireland except in the desire, whether admitted or\r\ndenied, to maintain the privileges and ascendancy of the Protestant\r\ninterest. Mr. Redmond was criticised with acrimony and vehemence for\r\nfailing to do what he could not have done, and forcing the Cabinet to take\r\naction. When later the importation of arms into Ireland was prohibited by\r\nOrder in Council, a proceeding of doubtful legality, this also was\r\ninterpreted _in malam partem_: it was aimed not so much at preventing\r\nUlster from getting more arms as at preventing the rest of Ireland from\r\ngetting any. It was a piquant situation. Ulster, which had been for a\r\ncentury the backbone of the \"loyalist\" interest in Ireland, whose one\r\npublicly proclaimed panacea for all Irish disorders and complaints had\r\nbeen \"the firm and impartial administration of the law,\" which had called\r\nfor the suppression of every attempt on the part of Nationalist Ireland\r\neven to express its national aspirations, was now openly contemptuous of\r\nthe law, loud in its expressions of defiance of the Government and\r\ncharging the Cabinet, suspected of some faint determination to do\r\nsomething to assert itself, with \"organizing a pogrom.\" On the other hand\r\nNationalist Ireland, the supposed enemy of all law, order and even public\r\ndecency, was lifting up its hands in horror at the insult to the majesty\r\nof British law and calling upon its representatives in Parliament to do\r\nsomething, anything, to ensure respect for it. It called upon the\r\nGovernment to show itself to be in earnest, the Government being in\r\nreality as much in earnest as anybody. But, perplexed at the prospect of\r\nhaving to enforce the law in Ireland against the wrong people, the King's\r\nGovernment continued to eye the Ulster Government, each \"willing to wound\r\nand yet afraid to strike.\" As a matter of fact the Ulster leaders, had\r\nthey been put to the pinch, could not have made their authority really\r\neffective even in their own area: but with admirable and consummate\r\naudacity they succeeded in making the fact seem so doubtful that any\r\nattempt to suppress them appeared to be involved in serious risk.\r\n\r\nAmong the Nationalists the only section which was able to use the\r\nsituation to advantage was the Republican Party. To them it seemed\r\nincredible that any Irishman should be willing to fight either for or\r\nagainst such a measure as Home Rule, which gave Ireland a subordinate and\r\nimpoverished parliament and retained the Imperial connection practically\r\nunimpaired. But whatever the merits of the measure in itself it had in\r\ntheir eyes one wholly admirable result. It had for the first time since\r\nthe days of the Fenians roused a section of Irishmen to arm against the\r\nBritish Government: and it had opened the eyes of all Irish Unionists,\r\narmed or unarmed in opposition to it, to the fact that the interests of\r\ntheir party, courted and promoted in Ireland for a century in English\r\ninterests, were as nothing to an English Government when the exigencies of\r\nparty warfare required that they should be sacrificed. Their view was put\r\nforcibly and humorously by P. H. Pearse in an article contributed to\r\n_Irish Freedom_ in 1913. \"It is now,\" he wrote, \"the creed of Irish\r\nnationalism (or at least of that Irish nationalism which is vocal on\r\nplatforms and in the Press) that the possession of arms and the knowledge\r\nof the use of arms is a fit subject for satire. To have a rifle is as\r\nridiculous as to have a pimple at the end of your nose, or a bailiff\r\nwaiting for you round the corner. To be able to use a rifle is an\r\naccomplishment as futile as to be able to stand on your head or to be\r\nable to wag your ears. This is not the creed of any nationalism that\r\nexists or has ever existed in any community, civilized or uncivilized,\r\nthat has ever inhabited the globe. It has never been the creed of Irish\r\nnationalism until this our day. Mitchel and the great confessors of Irish\r\nnationalism would have laughed it to scorn. Mitchel indeed did laugh to\r\nscorn a similar but much less foolish doctrine of O'Connell's; and the\r\ngeneration that came after O'Connell rejected his doctrine and accepted\r\nMitchel's. The present generation of Irish Nationalists is not only\r\nunfamiliar with arms but despises all who are familiar with arms. Irish\r\nNationalists share with certain millionaires the distinction of being the\r\nonly people who believe in Universal Peace--here and now.... It is foolish\r\nof an Orangeman to believe that his personal liberty is threatened by Home\r\nRule: but, granting that he believes that, it is not only in the highest\r\ndegree common sense, but it is his clear duty to arm in defence of his\r\nthreatened liberty. Personally, I think the Orangeman with a rifle a much\r\nless ridiculous figure than the Nationalist without a rifle; and the\r\nOrangeman who can fire a gun will certainly count for more in the end than\r\nthe Nationalist who can do nothing cleverer than make a pun.... I am not\r\ndefending the Orangeman; I am only showing that his condemnation does not\r\nlie in the mouth of an unarmed Nationalist.... Negotiations might be\r\nopened with the Orangeman on these lines: You are creating a Provisional\r\nGovernment of Ulster--make it a Provisional Government of Ireland and we\r\nwill recognize and obey it. O'Connell said long ago that he would rather\r\nbe ruled by the old Protestant Ascendancy Irish Parliament than by the\r\nUnion Parliament; 'and O'Connell was right,' said Mitchel. He certainly\r\nwas.... Any six Irishmen would be a better Government of Ireland than the\r\nEnglish Cabinet has been.... Better exploit Ireland for the benefit of\r\nBelfast than exploit her for the benefit of Westminster. A rapprochement\r\nbetween Orangemen and Nationalists would be difficult. The chief obstacles\r\nare the Orangeman's lack of humour and the Nationalist's lack of guns:\r\neach would be at a disadvantage in a conference. But a sense of humour can\r\nbe cultivated, and guns can be purchased. One great source of\r\nmisunderstanding has now disappeared: it has become clear within the last\r\nfew years that the Orangeman is no more loyal to England than we are. He\r\nwants the Union because he imagines that it secures his prosperity: but he\r\nis ready to fire on the Union flag the moment it threatens his prosperity.\r\nThe position is perfectly plain and understandable. Foolish notions of\r\nloyalty to England being eliminated, it is a matter for businesslike\r\nnegotiation. A Nationalist mission to North-east Ulster would possibly\r\neffect some good. The case might be put thus: Hitherto England has\r\ngoverned Ireland through the Orange Lodges: she now proposes to govern\r\nIreland through the A.O.H. You object: so do we. Why not unite and get\r\nrid of the English? They are the real difficulty; their presence here the\r\nreal incongruity.\" When Pearse wrote this he seemed like a voice crying in\r\nthe wilderness: but the echoes answered sooner than anyone expected.\r\nPearse afterwards confessed that this and other articles contributed by\r\nhim at this time to _Irish Freedom_ were written \"with the deliberate\r\nintention by argument, invective, and satire, of goading those who shared\r\nmy political views to commit themselves definitely to an armed movement.\"\r\nThe armed movement which resulted was that of the Irish Volunteers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nULSTER AND NATIONALIST IRELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nNationalist Ireland had been officially committed to a peaceful and\r\nconstitutional policy since the inception of the Home Rule Movement in\r\n1870. Home Rule did not satisfy, and was never admitted as satisfying, the\r\nnational demand. But the Fenian Movement had at last driven into the heads\r\nof even Irish landlords and Tories that some concession to national\r\nsentiment was necessary if the government of Ireland was to be made a\r\ntolerable task for decent men. The Home Rule programme was one in which\r\nRepealers and Conservatives agreed to join, the former in despair of\r\ngetting anything better, the latter in despair of retaining any longer all\r\nthat they had. But once accepted by the Repealers it had committed them,\r\nin the necessities of the case, to a strictly parliamentary policy; and\r\nthat policy continued to be pursued even after the necessities which\r\ncaused it to be adopted ceased to operate. It was not a policy ever\r\naccepted without reservation by Irish Nationalists: a considerable body of\r\nthem held aloof always from the Home Rulers, regretting the old virile\r\nways and words of Mitchel and Davis, and regarding the Home Rule programme\r\nas a Tory snare into which Irish Nationalism had fallen. The years of\r\nParnell's leadership saw a nearer approach to national unanimity in the\r\nparliamentary policy than was seen before or has been seen since. But it\r\nwas emphatically in the eyes of \"strong\" Nationalists a policy that could\r\nonly be justified by results, and the results were slow to appear. When\r\nthey appeared at last in the shape of a Home Rule Bill of the Asquith\r\nMinistry there is no doubt that had it been carried and put into operation\r\nthe advocates of a stronger policy would have been overborne by the men of\r\nmoderate opinions. That is not to say that Home Rule would have been\r\naccepted by all coming generations as a satisfactory solution of the Irish\r\nsituation; but it would have meant an immediate settling down of the\r\ncountry to the solution of many internal problems and the return to\r\nIreland of something approaching the normal conditions of a civilized\r\ncountry. The prospect was shattered by the enrolling of the Ulster\r\nVolunteers. To the ordinary Home Ruler, the moderate Irish Nationalist,\r\ntheir action seemed to be a gross and unpardonable breach of faith. For a\r\ncentury Irish Unionists had uttered to Irish Nationalists the unvarying\r\nchallenge to acknowledge and submit to the supremacy of the Imperial\r\nParliament: they had called upon Ireland to abandon its appeal to history\r\nand its \"impossible claims\" to an independence which Parliament could\r\nnever sanction. The Home Rule Party had done so: no renunciation of a\r\nclaim to sovereign independence could be more explicit and unequivocal\r\nthan that made by Mr. Redmond. So far as the Home Rule Party was\r\nconcerned, they had agreed to all the terms imposed upon them: they had\r\nappealed to Parliament, submitting to all the conditions implied in the\r\nrecognition of it as the court of final resort, and now their opponents\r\nchallenged in advance the competence of Parliament to decide, and fell\r\nback upon the weapons which Nationalist Ireland had been persuaded to\r\nabandon. But though the Ulster Unionists might break the pact, it was\r\ngenerally expected that the court to which they had taken their appeal\r\nwould see that its competence to decide it was not challenged. The\r\nexpectation was vain. The English Tory Party bluntly proclaimed that if\r\nUlster decided to repudiate the verdict of Parliament, Ulster would be\r\nsupported in any measure to that end which it should resolve to take. And\r\nin the face of this proclamation the Liberal Party seemed to hesitate: the\r\nIrish Party in Parliament could extract nothing from the Government beyond\r\nvague assurances that all would finally be well. Nationalist Ireland,\r\nsurprised, uneasy, suspicious, indignant saw nothing more reassuring than\r\nbroad smiles of indulgent benevolence upon the faces of Cabinet Ministers.\r\n\r\nBut Ulster Unionists were not the only people in Ireland who disliked Home\r\nRule. It was just as little to the taste of Sinn Fein and the Republicans\r\nand the Labour Party as it was to them. If the Ulster Party thought that\r\nHome Rule was too great a concession, the others thought that it was\r\npractically no concession at all. But being in a minority they were\r\nprepared for the present to submit. The Sinn Fein Party and the\r\nRepublicans were well aware that Home Rule meant a set back to their\r\nprogramme. Little as it conferred in comparison with what they wished to\r\nhave, it was certain to allay for many years the sting of Irish discontent\r\nand to prolong the period during which Ireland would seek its satisfaction\r\nin the shadow of its coming fortunes. The Labour Party had already begun\r\nto organize its forces with a view to participation in the activities of\r\nthe expected Parliament, and looked forward with a modest confidence to\r\nits immediate future. To all of these the arming of Ulster, which made the\r\nParliamentarians so indignant, was a light in the darkness. They had been\r\nfor years protesting unheeded against a policy which acknowledged the Act\r\nof Union by acknowledging the supremacy of the Parliament which it set up:\r\ntheir words had fallen for the most part upon stopped ears. And now from\r\nthe party supposed to regard the supremacy of Parliament as on a level\r\nwith the Ten Commandments came the mutterings of revolt and the rattle of\r\narms. Ulster had decided to defy \"the English edict which would keep\r\nIrishmen disarmed while the meanest Englishman may arm himself to the\r\nteeth\"; Ulster had taken up arms \"against the usurped authority of the\r\nParliament of Great Britain to make laws to bind them.\" _Sinn Fein_\r\npromised that Unionist Ulster would in its coming struggle with the\r\nEnglish Parliament \"receive the sympathy and support of Nationalist\r\nIreland.\" From the Republican Party the action of the Volunteers received\r\nunstinted and enthusiastic commendation. \"Ulster has done one thing,\"\r\nwrote _Irish Freedom_, \"which commands the respect and admiration of all\r\ngenuine Nationalists--she has stood up for what she believes to be right\r\nand will be cajoled neither by English threats nor English bayonets. Her\r\nattitude in this affair is the attitude of the O'Neills and the\r\nO'Donnells: no other people but an Irish people could do it and something\r\nof the kind was very necessary to shame the rest of Ireland out of\r\nJ.P.-ships and jobs into some facing of the facts.... In present\r\ncircumstances accursed be the soul of any Nationalist who would dream of\r\nfiring a shot or drawing a sword against the Ulster Volunteers in\r\nconnection with this Bill. Any such action would be an enforcement of a\r\nBritish law upon an Irish populace which refused it, would be a\r\nmarshalling under the Union Jack. We are willing to fight Ulster or to\r\nnegotiate with her, but we will not fight her over the miserable shadow of\r\nautonomy, we will not fight her because she tells England to go to Hell.\"\r\n\"The sheen of arms in Ulster was always the signal for the rest of\r\nIreland. And Ireland even in this generation, hypnotized as most of her\r\npeople are by catch cries about 'imperilling Home Rule,' by mockeries of\r\nall 'wild' politics and 'wild' plans, by doctrines even more debasing in\r\ntheir shameless lying than O'Connell's, Ireland has answered the call.\"\r\n\r\nBut to see in a revolt against a particular Act of Parliament a revolt\r\nagainst the supremacy of Parliament _simpliciter_ was a mistake. Ulster\r\nwas willing, anxious indeed, that the supremacy of the Imperial Parliament\r\nshould be maintained in Ireland, but she made one condition: that\r\nParliament should ensure in Ireland the Protestant Ascendancy. For that\r\nUlster Protestantism professed to be prepared to fight to the death. It\r\nwas secured by the Legislative Union; and to weaken the Union was to\r\nweaken it. So long as Ireland formed \"an integral part of the United\r\nKingdom,\" so long as Catholic Irishmen were in a permanent minority in the\r\nParliament of that kingdom, so long did it seem certain that the\r\nProtestant interest would be secure. Protestant England was considered to\r\nhave made a pact with Protestant Ulster, and Ulster was prepared to\r\nenforce its observance even by force of arms. Ulster trembled when the\r\nshadow of the Vatican fell across her as men once trembled at an eclipse\r\nof the sun: and the Union seemed the only guarantee that recurrent\r\neclipses would not be the harbingers of a perpetual darkness.\r\n\r\nAnd whatever elements of hope for the future Sinn Fein and Republican\r\nIreland might see in the attitude of the Ulster Volunteers towards England\r\nit was plain that while they might be praised and imitated they could not\r\nbe followed. They were a strictly sectarian force formed to promote a\r\nstrictly sectarian object, while Sinn Feiners and Republicans stood for\r\nthe union of all Irishmen without distinction of creed. And their close\r\n(and, as it seemed to many Irishmen, unnatural) alliance with the English\r\nTory Party was clear proof that their revolt (so far as it went) against\r\nthe authority of Parliament could and would be utilized to the greater\r\nadvantage of England and the detriment of Ireland. Ulster might propose to\r\nfight for her own hand and her own position in Ireland, but her English\r\nallies would see to it that nothing which Ulster gained would be lost to\r\nEngland. The moral to be drawn was that Ulster being part of Ireland was,\r\nhowever wayward and bitter, to be treated with consideration and respect;\r\nher fears for her safety to be allayed; even her prejudices to be\r\nconsidered and met; her incipient feeling of resentment against England\r\napplauded and encouraged. So far and no farther Irish Nationalists could\r\ngo: but Ulster's claim to ascendancy could not for a moment be recognized.\r\nMeanwhile the rest of Ireland should follow the example of the North and\r\narm in defence of a threatened liberty.\r\n\r\nThis was the attitude not merely of Sinn Feiners and Republicans, but of\r\nmany followers of the Parliamentary Party. But the bulk of the\r\nparliamentarians took a different view. Some of them deprecated all\r\nappeals to violence on the part of Irish Nationalists and held that it was\r\nthe business of Parliament to enforce its own authority upon the\r\nrecalcitrants: others thought nothing should be done, because nothing need\r\nbe done, Ulster being accustomed to threaten, but never being known to\r\nstrike: others again thought that the Ulster threats should be countered\r\nby threats as determined, backed by means not less efficacious.\r\n\r\nThe last of these Nationalist sections joined with the Republicans and\r\nsome of the Sinn Feiners, Sinn Fein still officially adhering to its\r\ntraditional policy, to form, in imitation of the Ulstermen, the force of\r\nthe Irish Volunteers. The promoters of the movement were anxious to avoid\r\nall appearance of opposition to a body of Irishmen whom, however they\r\nmight differ from them and no matter what collisions with them might occur\r\nlater, they respected for their vigour and resolution: on the other hand\r\nthey desired to make it perfectly plain that Ulster was not the only part\r\nof Ireland that had the courage to proclaim its intention of standing up\r\nfor its rights. At a meeting held in the Rotunda in Dublin on November 25,\r\n1913, the movement was publicly inaugurated.\r\n\r\nOf the committee which took charge of the movement during its earlier\r\nstages some were (or had been) supporters of Sinn Fein, others were\r\nRepublicans, more than a third were supporters of the Parliamentary Party\r\nand a few had never identified themselves with any Irish political party\r\nof any kind. And the manifesto to the Irish people issued by the committee\r\nbore clear indications of its composite origin. It took sides neither with\r\nnor against any form of Irish Nationalism and it contained no word of\r\nhostility against the Ulster force. \"The object proposed,\" it said, \"for\r\nthe Irish Volunteers is to secure and maintain the rights and liberties\r\ncommon to all the people of Ireland. Their duties will be defensive and\r\nprotective, and they will not contemplate either aggression or domination.\r\nTheir ranks are open to all able-bodied Irishmen without distinction of\r\ncreed, politics or social grade.... In the name of National Unity, of\r\nNational Dignity, of National and Individual Liberty, of Manly\r\nCitizenship, we appeal to our countrymen to recognize and accept without\r\nhesitation the opportunity that has been granted them to join the ranks of\r\nthe Irish Volunteers, and to make the movement now begun not unworthy of\r\nthe historic title which it has adopted.\" Volunteers were to sign a\r\ndeclaration that they desired \"to be enrolled in the Irish Volunteers\r\nformed to secure and maintain the rights and liberties common to all the\r\npeople of Ireland without distinction of creed, class or politics.\" The\r\nfinal words of the declaration were an answer to the charge, printed in an\r\nEnglish newspaper a few days before, that the new movement was to form a\r\nVolunteer force of Catholics in hostility to Protestants, and an answer by\r\nanticipation to the charge, made freely afterwards, that the Volunteers\r\nwere intended to deprive Unionist Ulster of her just rights. The attitude\r\ndeliberately adopted towards Ulster could not have been better put than it\r\nwas by the President of the Volunteers, Professor Eoin MacNeill, in his\r\nspeech at the inaugural meeting. \"We do not contemplate,\" he said, \"any\r\nhostility to the Volunteer movement that has already been initiated in\r\nparts of Ulster. The strength of that movement consists in men whose\r\nkinsfolk were amongst the foremost and the most resolute in winning\r\nfreedom for the United States of America, in descendants of the Irish\r\nVolunteers of 1782, of the United Irishmen, of the Antrim and Down\r\ninsurgents of 1798, of the Ulster Protestants who protested in thousands\r\nagainst the destruction of the Irish Parliament in 1800. The more genuine\r\nand successful the local Volunteer movement in Ulster becomes, the more\r\ncompletely does it establish the principle that Irishmen have the right to\r\ndecide and govern their own national affairs. We have nothing to fear from\r\nthe existing Volunteers in Ulster nor they from us. We gladly acknowledge\r\nthe evident truth that they have opened the way for a National Volunteer\r\nmovement, and we trust that the day is near when their own services to the\r\ncause of an Irish Nation will become as memorable as the services of their\r\nforefathers.\"\r\n\r\nThis was noble and chivalrous language and it loses none of its force when\r\none recollects that many of the platforms in Ulster were ringing at the\r\ntime with denunciations of \"our hereditary enemies\" and with references to\r\nIrish Catholics as \"hewers of wood and drawers of water,\" \"the men whom we\r\nhate and despise.\"\r\n\r\nBut in spite of the fact that the leaders of the Irish Volunteers wished\r\nto preserve, and largely succeeded in preserving, a non-provocative\r\nattitude towards the Ulstermen, the governing facts of the situation could\r\nhardly be ignored completely. Phrases used at meetings for the enrolment\r\nof Irish Volunteers appreciative of the spirit of Ulster were strongly\r\nresented by many Nationalists who saw in the Ulster Volunteers a menace\r\nnot to the English exploitation of Ireland but to the national hopes. And\r\neven the leading spirits in the movement could not conceal the fact that\r\nthe Ulster Volunteers, whatever they might prove to be in the future, were\r\ncertainly a present obstacle to the attainment of Home Rule, which, little\r\nregarded by Sinn Fein and the Republicans as a final settlement, was\r\nundoubtedly the only approach to a settlement that could be looked for in\r\nthe near future. The blame of this it was sought to throw on the English\r\nTory Party. \"A use has been made,\" said Professor MacNeill, \"and is daily\r\nmade, of the Ulster Volunteer movement, that leaves the whole body of\r\nIrishmen no choice but to take a firm stand in defence of their liberties.\r\nThe leaders of the Unionist Party in Great Britain and the journalists,\r\npublic speakers and election agents of that party are employing the threat\r\nof armed force to control the course of political elections and to compel,\r\nif they can, a change of Government in England with the declared object of\r\ndeciding what all parties admit to be vital political issues concerning\r\nIreland. They claim that this line of action has been successful in recent\r\nparliamentary elections and that they calculate by it to obtain further\r\nsuccesses, and at the most moderate estimate to force upon this country\r\nsome diminished and mutilated form of National Self-Government. This is\r\nnot merely to deny our rights as a nation. If we are to have our concerns\r\nregulated by a majority of British representatives owing their position\r\nand powers to a display of armed force, no matter from what quarter that\r\nforce is derived, it is plain to every man that even the modicum of civil\r\nrights left to us by the Union is taken from us, our franchise becomes a\r\nmockery and we ourselves become the most degraded nation in Europe. This\r\ninsolent menace does not satisfy the hereditary enemies of our National\r\nFreedom. Within the past few days a political manifesto has been issued,\r\nsigned most fittingly by a Castlereagh and a Beresford, calling for\r\nBritish Volunteers and for money to arm and equip them to be sent into\r\nIreland to triumph over the Irish people and to complete their\r\ndisfranchisement and enslavement.\"\r\n\r\nAll this was true, but it was only half the truth. It was true that the\r\nTory Party was making use of the threat of armed force; but the threat had\r\nbeen made before the Tory Party could make use of it, and it had been made\r\nby a body of armed Irishmen. But the followers were, as often happens,\r\nless virulent than their leaders; and months after this the sight might\r\nhave been witnessed in Belfast of Ulster Volunteers and Irish Volunteers\r\nusing the same drill ground through the good offices of a tolerant\r\nUlsterman: and though the Ulster Volunteers were prepared undoubtedly to\r\nfight for their privileges, some of the most vicious appeals to their\r\npassions and their prejudices came from men who were not of the Ulster,\r\nnot even of the Irish, blood. Right through their tragic and tempestuous\r\ncareer the Irish Volunteers in spite of countless difficulties and\r\nprovocations continued their attitude of punctilious courtesy to the\r\nUlster force. When the Ulstermen succeeded in their great coup of running\r\na cargo of rifles from Hamburg to Larne the _Irish Volunteer_\r\ncongratulated them heartily and warmly. Their attitude towards their\r\nfellow-countrymen was deeply regretted, but for what they had done to\r\nassert the freedom of Irishmen from English dictation they were accorded\r\ngenerous praise. The spirit of the leaders in this matter permeated the\r\nforce. The head of the Irish Volunteers in Tralee wrote at a time when\r\nthreats of suppressing the Ulstermen with the help of the army were made:\r\n\"To my mind the Volunteers should prevent if possible and by force the\r\nEnglish soldiers attacking the Ulster rebels. Say to the English soldiers\r\nand to the English Government, 'This is our soil and the Ulster rebels are\r\nour countrymen; fire on them and you fire on us.'... Ulster is not our\r\nreal enemy, though ... Ulster thinks we are her enemy. Time will prove who\r\nare Ulster's friends and ours.\"\r\n\r\nBut the history of the Irish Volunteers, though indispensable for the\r\nunderstanding of the development of Sinn Fein is not the history of Sinn\r\nFein. Individual Sinn Feiners were prominent in the movement and brought\r\ninto it the spirit of national unity and disregard of the differences of\r\ncreed which kept Irishmen divided: but the Sinn Fein organization remained\r\ndistinct, praising, warning and criticizing the new movement and the\r\ntactics of its leaders. It pointed out at once that for the Volunteers to\r\ncombine and to drill was not enough: they must have rifles and rifle\r\nranges, and urged that the provision of them should be seen to without\r\ndelay. But though it wished the Volunteers to be equipped as effectively\r\nand as quickly as possible it still regarded an armed force of Irishmen as\r\ninadequate to the task of winning Irish freedom. \"To help the Volunteer\r\nmovement,\" said _Sinn Fein_, \"is a national duty: they may not defeat\r\nEngland, but the movement will help to make Ireland self-reliant.\" And\r\n_Sinn Fein_ was emphatic in urging the dangers of a sectional policy, of\r\nany attempt to narrow the basis upon which the new force was to be built\r\nup. \"It is better,\" ran a leader on the subject, \"at the beginning of the\r\nNational Volunteer movement there should be frank speaking and frank\r\nunderstanding. If it were designed to be a movement confined to or\r\ncontrolled by any one Nationalist section we would not write a word in its\r\nsupport. It would fail badly.... It is quite true that we must work\r\nthrough public opinion in the circumstances of Ireland rather than through\r\nforce of arms, but it is a poor thinker who does not realize that the\r\npublic opinion which lacks the confidence, the calmness, the steadiness,\r\nthe judgment, the resolution and the understanding which a training in\r\narms gives a people is a poor weapon to rely upon in times of crisis.\"\r\nThe Volunteers were in the opinion of Sinn Fein a useful auxiliary in the\r\ntask of developing the one quality from which alone ultimate success was\r\nto be expected, the self-reliance and moral resolution of the Irish\r\npeople. But [Greek: autos ephelketai andra sideros]--the mere \"sheen of\r\narms\" has an attraction superior to all arguments and all policies: and\r\nthere is little doubt that the superior attractions of the Volunteers\r\nproved too strong for many young and ardent Sinn Feiners and induced them\r\nto put the means first and the end second. The phrase of _Irish Freedom_\r\nin noticing the inauguration of the Volunteers probably gives the view of\r\nmost of the younger generation: \"In this welcome departure from our\r\nendless talk we touch reality at last.\"\r\n\r\nThe Irish Volunteers were not the only militant body which the example of\r\nUlster had formed in Ireland. While the Ulster campaign was in full swing\r\nthe workers of Dublin had been engaged in a bitter industrial struggle\r\nwith their employers in which after a prolonged battle victory had\r\nsomewhat doubtfully declared itself against them. The Labour leader, Jim\r\nLarkin, decided to found a Citizen Army for Irish workers. \"Labour,\" he\r\nsaid in addressing the meeting at which the new force was inaugurated, \"in\r\nits own defence must begin to train itself to act with disciplined courage\r\nand with organized and concentrated force. How could they accomplish this?\r\nBy taking a leaf out of the book of Carson. If Carson had permission to\r\ntrain his braves of the North to fight against the aspirations of the\r\nIrish people, then it was legitimate and fair for Labour to organize in\r\nthe same militant way to preserve their rights and to ensure that if they\r\nwere attacked they would be able to give a very satisfactory account of\r\nthemselves.\" He went on to say that the object of the Citizen Army was\r\n\"that Labour might no longer be defenceless but might be able to utilize\r\nthat great physical power which it possessed to prevent their elemental\r\nrights from being taken from them and to evolve such a system of unified\r\naction, self-control and ordered discipline that Labour in Ireland might\r\nmarch in the forefront of all movements for the betterment of the whole\r\npeople of Ireland.\" The Citizen Army thus formed, never very numerous,\r\nefficient or enthusiastic, was practically destroyed by the formation of\r\nthe Irish Volunteers. Most of its members joined the Volunteers, partly\r\nbecause they were the more numerous and popular body, but principally\r\nbecause a national policy had more attraction for them than one which was\r\npurely sectional. Captain White, who had trained the first Citizen Army,\r\nnow urged that it should be reorganized upon a broader basis and in March,\r\n1914, the Citizen Army, which afterwards played such a memorable part, was\r\nput upon its final footing. The new constitution was as follows: \"That the\r\nfirst and last principle of the Irish Citizen Army is the avowal that the\r\nownership of Ireland, moral and material, is vested of right in the people\r\nof Ireland: that the Irish Citizen Army shall stand for the absolute\r\nunity of Irish nationhood and shall support the rights and liberties of\r\nthe democracies of all nations: that one of its objects shall be to sink\r\nall differences of birth, property and creed under the common name of the\r\nIrish People: that the Citizen Army shall be open to all who accept the\r\nprinciple of equal rights and opportunities for the Irish People.\"\r\n\r\nIt might have seemed that the constitution and principles of the Citizen\r\nArmy were wide enough and national enough to justify a union or at least a\r\nclose co-operation with the Irish Volunteers. But at first the two bodies\r\nheld sternly aloof. The Labour Party had not been invited to send\r\nrepresentatives to the meeting at which the Volunteers had been\r\ninaugurated, and many of the Volunteer Committee were suspected, rightly\r\nor wrongly, of being entirely out of sympathy with Labour ideals and\r\nLabour policy. When members of the Labour Party began to flock into the\r\nVolunteer ranks their action was the occasion of a bitter controversy in\r\nthe official Labour organ. The Sinn Fein movement, whose spirit was\r\nsupposed to preside over the Volunteer organization, had never been on\r\ncordial terms with organized Labour, and the members of the Irish Citizen\r\nArmy were publicly warned to keep clear of these \"Girondin politicians,\r\nwho will simply use the workers as the means towards their own security\r\nand comfort.\" Nor were the members of the Ancient Order of Hibernians and\r\nof the United Irish League who belonged to the Volunteer Committee any\r\nmore to the taste of Labour; they regarded these two bodies as bitter and\r\nimplacable opponents of their rights. Regarding themselves as the true\r\nsuccessors of the Nationalism of Wolfe Tone and John Mitchel, they called\r\nupon the Volunteers for an explicit declaration of what was meant by \"the\r\nrights common to all Irishmen\" which they were enrolled to maintain. Did\r\nthey mean the right to Home Rule, or to the constitution of 1782 or to an\r\nIrish Republic? The Volunteers could not have said \"Yes\" to any one of the\r\nthree alternatives without driving out members who desired to say \"Yes\" to\r\none or other of the remaining two. The Volunteers had deliberately left in\r\nabeyance controversies which the Labour Army wished to fight out in\r\nadvance. They, undoubtedly, desired a Republic and meant to say so. When\r\nit was announced that the Irish Volunteers would be under the control of\r\nthe Irish Parliament (when there should be such a body to control them)\r\nLabour became more suspicious still; was not the only Irish Parliament\r\neven in contemplation to be subordinate to the Parliament of England? The\r\nVolunteers seemed to treat the Citizen Army with indifference, if not with\r\ncontempt: and a bitter antagonism was developed which only common\r\nmisfortune was able to mitigate.\r\n\r\nIn all this welter of sharp antagonisms and conflicting policies the only\r\nparty which walked in the old political ways was the Parliamentary Party.\r\nThey expected confidently that political conventions would finally be\r\nobserved or that Parliament would deal effectively with those who tried to\r\nbreak them. It was becoming plain, however, as time went on that the\r\nconventions were not going to be regarded and that Parliament was as\r\nlikely as not to acquiesce in the breach of them. And the Party was not\r\naware of the change that was slowly passing over Ireland. A long tenure of\r\ntheir place among the great personages and amid the high doings of\r\nWestminster seemed to have made them somewhat oblivious of the fact that\r\nIrish politics are made in Ireland. They did not feel the thrill of\r\nchastened pride that shivered gently through Ireland when the quiet places\r\nof Ulster echoed to the march of the Ulster Volunteers. They did not know\r\nhow many Irishmen regarded the action of Ulster not as a menace to the\r\ndignity of the Parliament in which the Party sat but as the harbinger of\r\nnational independence. They underrated (as who then did not?) the\r\ninfluence of Sinn Fein; they regarded the foundation of the Irish\r\nVolunteers as the work of \"irresponsible young men,\" though the \"young\r\nmen\" were nearer the heart of Young Ireland: like O'Connell, they \"stood\r\nfor Old Ireland and had some notion that Old Ireland would stand by them.\"\r\nIreland, though no one guessed it at the time, was the crucible in which\r\nwere slowly melting and settling down all the elements that were to go to\r\nthe making of the future Sinn Fein.\r\n\r\nSinn Fein was at the time to all outward seeming an insignificant and\r\ndiscredited party with an impossible programme. It still published a\r\nsmall weekly paper with no great circulation. It did not agree with the\r\nparliamentarians: it had a standing feud with the Labour Party: it gave a\r\ndignified and pontifical blessing to the Volunteers without committing\r\nitself to their whole programme. Its only electioneering venture, outside\r\nmunicipal politics, had been a disastrous failure: it had won a few seats\r\non the Dublin City Council: it had tried and failed to run a daily paper.\r\nWhen all Nationalist Ireland was waiting for Home Rule it declared Home\r\nRule to be a thing of naught. To the buoyant confidence of the\r\nParliamentary Party it opposed a cynical distrust of their aims and\r\nmethods, a constant incredulity of their ultimate success. When the Party\r\npointed to what it had done and to what it was about to do Sinn Fein\r\nreminded the country that the very existence of a Parliamentary Party was\r\nan acknowledgment of the Act of Union. When the Liberal Government was\r\nengaged in an embittered and apparently final struggle for supremacy with\r\nthe Tory Party in the interests of Ireland, Sinn Fein professed entire\r\ndisbelief in its sincerity; it asserted that the Liberals really loved the\r\nTories very much better than they loved the Irish. With a querulous and\r\nmonotonous insistence it preached distrust of all English parties and even\r\nof the English nation, towards whom it displayed a hostility that seemed\r\nalmost to amount to a monomania. To Irish Labour this indiscriminating\r\nattitude seemed insensate bigotry: to the Irish people as a whole it\r\nseemed incomprehensible that a Nationalist Party should regard the\r\nLiberals as enemies and the Ulster Volunteers as brothers in arms. Sinn\r\nFein never seemed less certain of a future in Ireland than when events\r\nwere preparing to make Ireland Sinn Fein.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1914 _Sinn Fein_ saw in the King's Speech at the opening of\r\nParliament indications that the Cabinet and the Opposition had arranged \"a\r\ndeal\" over Home Rule and foretold an attempt at compromise. The next month\r\nthe Prime Minister proposed the partition of Ireland between the Unionists\r\nand the Nationalists and the Irish Party accepted the proposal as a\r\ntemporary device to ease the parliamentary situation for the Cabinet. No\r\nproposal better calculated to offend the deepest instincts of Irish\r\nnationalism could have been made: no concession more fatal to the party\r\nwhich agreed to it could have been devised. The mention of it provoked an\r\noutburst in Ireland which did more to smash the Parliamentary Party and\r\nleave the field open to their rivals than anything which had happened\r\nsince Home Rule was first mooted. The criticisms passed upon it by the\r\nnon-Parliamentary Nationalists were important, not so much on account of\r\nthe quarters they came from, as for the grounds on which they were made,\r\nand their words awakened deeper feelings than had come to the surface for\r\nyears. \"To even discuss,\" said _Sinn Fein_, \"the exclusion of Ulster or\r\nany portion of Ulster from a Home Rule measure is in itself traitorous.\r\nWhen God made this country, He fixed its frontiers beyond the power of\r\nman to alter while the sea rises and falls.... So long as England is\r\nstrong and Ireland is weak, England may continue to oppress this country,\r\nbut she shall not dismember it.\" \"If this nation is to go down,\" wrote\r\n_Irish Freedom_, \"let it go down gallantly as becomes its history, let it\r\ngo down fighting, but let it not sink into the abjectness of carving a\r\nslice out of itself and handing it over to England.... As for Ulster,\r\nUlster is Ireland's and shall remain Ireland's. Though the Irish nation in\r\nits political and corporate capacity were gall and wormwood to every\r\nUnionist in Ulster yet shall they swallow it. We will fight them if they\r\nwant fighting: but we shall never let them go, never.\" Sinn Fein and the\r\nRepublicans were no more emphatic than the Labour Party. James Connolly in\r\nthe _Irish Worker_ said of Partition: \"To it Labour should give the\r\nbitterest opposition, against it Labour in Ulster should fight even to the\r\ndeath if necessary as our fathers fought before us.\" It even used the\r\nmenace of partition as an argument in favour of joining the Citizen Army\r\nand urged that Volunteers should transfer their membership to a body which\r\n\"meant business.\" \"The Citizen Army,\" said an article signed with the\r\ninitials of one of its principal organizers, \"stands for Ireland--Orange\r\nand Green--one and indivisible. The men who tread the valleys and places\r\nCuchullain, Conall Cearnach, Russell and McCracken trod are bone of our\r\nbone and flesh of our flesh. Because they may have a different creed does\r\nnot matter to us; it never mattered to the Government: an Irish Protestant\r\ncorpse dangled as often at the end of a rope as did the corpse of an Irish\r\nCatholic.\"\r\n\r\nBut Sinn Fein saw that, though partition was unacceptable, it was no use\r\ncontinually asking the Ulstermen to name the safeguards they wanted. They\r\nwould not name what they did not want: no safeguards would secure them in\r\na democratic modern community against their chief objection to Home\r\nRule--that in an Irish Parliament Protestants, as such, would be in \"a\r\npermanent minority.\" It was of the very nature of things that they should\r\nbe, if representative institutions were to be recognized at all. But\r\nthough in a minority they need not be, as they asserted they would be,\r\nsubject to disabilities, and Sinn Fein held that every offer to allay\r\ntheir fears compatible with free institutions should be made. A Sinn Fein\r\nConvention held in Dublin towards the end of April, 1914, agreed to make\r\nthe Ulstermen, on behalf of Sinn Fein, the following proposals: (1),\r\nincreased representation in the Irish Parliament on the basis partly of\r\npopulation, partly of rateable value and partly of bulk of trade, the\r\nUlster representation to be increased by fifteen members including one for\r\nthe University of Belfast: two members to be given to the Unionist\r\nconstituency of Rathmines; (2), to fix all Ireland as the unit for the\r\nelection of the Senate or Upper House and to secure representation to the\r\nSouthern Unionist minority by Proportional Representation; (3), to\r\nguarantee that no tax should be imposed on the linen trade without the\r\nconsent of a majority of the Ulster representatives; (4), that the\r\nChairman of the Joint Exchequer Board should always be chosen by the\r\nUlster Representatives; (5), that all posts in the Civil Service should be\r\nfilled by examination; (6), that the Ulster Volunteer Force should be\r\nretained under its present leaders as portion of an Irish Volunteer Force\r\nand should not, except in case of invasion, be called upon to serve\r\noutside Ulster; (7), that the Irish Parliament should sit alternately in\r\nDublin and in Belfast; (8), that the clauses in the Home Rule Bill\r\nrestricting Irish trade and finance and prohibiting Ireland from\r\ncollecting and receiving its own taxes, or otherwise conflicting with any\r\nof the above proposals, should be amended. These proposals, the most\r\nstatesmanlike and generous proposals put forward on the Nationalist side,\r\nwere, though approved of generally by the Belfast Trades Council,\r\ncontemptuously ignored by the Ulster leaders.\r\n\r\nThe offer of partition likewise was promptly rejected by Ulster: like the\r\nIrish Citizen Army they \"meant business.\" They meant to smash Home Rule\r\nfor good and all, for the South as well as for the North of Ireland, and\r\nin conjunction with the English Tories they felt strong enough to do it.\r\nThey began openly to tamper with the allegiance of the army. Nor were\r\ntheir efforts without success. Not only did large numbers of ex-officers\r\noffer their services to the Ulster Volunteers, but many officers upon the\r\nactive list announced their intention of refusing to obey orders if\r\ndespatched to preserve order in Ulster and forestall the intention,\r\nbroadly hinted, of some of the Ulstermen to seize military depots in the\r\nprovince. It was an open boast in Belfast that the ship conveying the arms\r\nfrom Hamburg to Ulster had been sighted, but allowed to pass unchallenged\r\nby officers of the Royal Navy on the ships detailed to intercept it. They\r\nseemed deliberately to have adopted the policy of Catiline, _ruina\r\nexstinguere incendium_, \"to put out the fire by pulling down the house.\"\r\nIf the Protestant interest were to go down in Ireland, then should the\r\nBritish Constitution which had fostered it go down with it.\r\n\r\nAll this was, of course, matter for unfeigned delight to all the\r\n\"advanced\" people both in Ireland and outside of it. If officers were to\r\nhave the option of obeying orders or not at their will why should a like\r\nlatitude be denied the common soldier? If officers refused to act against\r\nUlster why should a private be required to fire upon strikers? Thanks were\r\npublicly returned by _Irish Freedom_ to \"the gallant British officers who\r\nhave helped their beloved Empire on to the brink above the precipice.\" But\r\nso far as England was concerned, the crisis was tided over by the usual\r\nmethod of compromise. There had been a \"misunderstanding\" for which both\r\nsides were more or less responsible. There had been no actual intention of\r\nemploying force in a political dispute and therefore the question in\r\ndebate did not arise. The Minister of War was dismissed on a side issue,\r\nthe Premier assumed his responsibilities and everybody was more or less\r\nsatisfied, except the Irish.\r\n\r\nWhatever were the rights or wrongs of the dispute between the Army and the\r\nGovernment, it was plain that the dispute had been composed at the expense\r\nof Home Rule. Partition in some form or other was now certain to accompany\r\nHome Rule, if Home Rule were not actually shelved. The Irish Party were\r\nsolemnly warned by the advanced Nationalist papers. \"Mr. Redmond has had\r\nhis chance,\" wrote one of these. \"When partition is again mentioned, let\r\nhim stand aside even at the cost of the 'Home Rule' Bill. There is a force\r\nand a spirit growing in Ireland which in the wrangle of British politics\r\nhe but vaguely realizes.\"\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Redmond was not so preoccupied with \"the wrangle of British\r\npolitics\" as he seemed. He realized quite clearly that the Irish\r\nVolunteers were growing in numbers and in influence and that neither their\r\nobject nor their existence was compatible with the principles of Home\r\nRule. They proclaimed their intention of putting themselves eventually at\r\nthe disposal of the Irish Parliament: but the Bill contemplated a\r\nParliament which should have no right to accept their services. They were\r\nlargely controlled by men who thought little of Home Rule and everything\r\nof the \"rights of Irishmen,\" which might mean just what the Liberal\r\nGovernment proposed to give but might also mean a great deal more. They\r\nwere a menace to the success of the parliamentary policy, and it seemed to\r\nbe his plain duty to suppress or to control them. To attempt suppression\r\nwould be dangerous: to control them seemed not impossible. He decided to\r\ndemand the right to nominate on their committee twenty-five \"tried and\r\ntrue\" Nationalists whose allegiance to his policy was unquestioned. The\r\ncommittee, faced by the alternative of either declaring war on Mr. Redmond\r\n(a course as dangerous to them as to declare war on them would have been\r\nto him) or of submitting to his demand, decided to submit. The twenty-five\r\nnew members (four of whom were priests and the majority of the remainder\r\nDublin Nationalists) joined the Committee and the Irish \"military crisis\"\r\nseemed to have been solved. In reality it was only beginning. The Citizen\r\nArmy promptly declared war upon the reconstituted Volunteer Committee. \"Is\r\nthere,\" asked _The Irish Worker_, \"one reliable man at the head of the\r\nNational Volunteer movement apart from Casement who, we believe, is in\r\nearnest and honest?... We admit the bulk of the rank and file are men of\r\nprinciple and men who are out for liberty for all men: but why allow the\r\nfoulest growth that ever cursed this land (the Hibernian Board of Erin) to\r\ncontrol an organization that might if properly handled accomplish great\r\nthings.\" It accused the committee of having passed the Volunteers over to\r\na \"gang of placehunters and political thugs\" and called upon the rank and\r\nfile to sever all connection with them: \"Our fathers died that we might be\r\nfree men. Are we going to allow their sacrifices to be as naught? Or are\r\nwe going to follow in their footsteps at the Rising of the Moon?\" The\r\nCitizen Army was gradually coming round to a standpoint more and more\r\nnational, and saw in the control of the Volunteers by the Parliamentarians\r\nnothing but disaster to its idea of what nationalism involved. _Sinn Fein_\r\nwas equally vehement: \"Redmond is only a tool,\" it wrote, \"in the hands of\r\nAsquith and Birrell who wish to destroy the Volunteers as Lord Northington\r\nwas a tool in the hands of Fox, to whom he wrote in 1783: 'They have got\r\ntoo powerful, and there is nothing for us but for our friends to go into\r\ntheir meetings and disturb the harmony of them and create division.'\" When\r\nMr. Redmond appealed to America for money to \"strengthen\" the Volunteers\r\nit pointed out that if he had been in earnest he would have asked not for\r\nmoney but for arms, and would have had the Arms Proclamation withdrawn by\r\nthe Government. It printed a series of letters to the Volunteers, of which\r\nthe first contained the words: \"The object [_i.e._ of the Volunteers] is\r\nobtaining and maintaining the independence of Ireland. Those who are in\r\nearnest should have their own committee, independent of Redmond and Co.\"\r\n_Irish Freedom_ headed its leader on the transaction \"The Kiss of Judas,\"\r\nand declared that \"after the British Government the Irish Parliamentary\r\nParty in its later years has been the most evil force in Ireland.\"\r\n\r\nThe original members of the Volunteer Committee were clearly uneasy and\r\ntried to put the best face they could upon the matter. In their official\r\norgan; _The Irish Volunteer_, they informed the public \"The control of the\r\ncommittee by Mr. John Redmond does not matter, provided his nominees\r\nrepresent the feelings of the Volunteers: if they do the Irish Party will\r\nsee to the withdrawing of the Arms Proclamation and proceed to arm the\r\nVolunteers at once.\" But the Irish Party did neither; and if Mr. Redmond\r\nwas expected to share the feelings of the Volunteers, the Volunteers\r\ncannot have shared the feelings of the committee. A month before this the\r\n_Irish Volunteer_ had printed the following: \"For over a generation\r\nIreland has taken her national views from men whose whole lives were bound\r\nup with the preservation of the peace. Suddenly, in a day, in an hour, the\r\nwhole situation has undergone a change. Force has reappeared as a factor\r\nin Irish political life.... It is to be hoped that men are not joining the\r\nnational army from any motives but those which actuated the founders. The\r\nobject of the Volunteers is to maintain and preserve the rights and\r\nliberties common to the whole people of Ireland. There is no question of\r\npreserving merely the 'legal' rights graciously permitted us by a foreign\r\npower.\" If the original committee seriously expected Mr. Redmond and his\r\nnominees to acquiesce in the views expressed in the last sentence they\r\nmust have been simple to a degree. They were admittedly in a difficult\r\nposition; but they knew what they meant and they knew what Mr. Redmond\r\nmeant; and the sequel might have been foreseen.\r\n\r\nIt was put upon record later by a member of the committee that in the task\r\nof arming the Volunteers the new members gave little effective assistance,\r\nand that when arms were obtained they tried to have them taken from the\r\nmen who had paid for them and handed over _gratis_ to the Hibernians of\r\nthe North to use (without, it is true, a supply of ammunition) to overawe\r\nthe aggression of the Ulster Volunteers. But the members of the original\r\ncommittee procured arms upon their own responsibility. In July they\r\nsucceeded in imitating the exploit of the Ulstermen at Larne. They ran a\r\ncargo of rifles into Howth and another was landed at Kilcool. But the\r\nforces of the Crown, absent at Larne and inactive in Ulster ever since,\r\ndisplayed their unsuccessful vigour at Howth. The Volunteers were\r\nintercepted on the way back, but after a scuffle succeeded in getting away\r\nwith their guns. The soldiers on the return journey fired upon a provoking\r\nbut unarmed crowd in the streets of Dublin. The country had barely time to\r\nappreciate the contrast between Larne and Howth, when the sound of the\r\nGerman guns in Belgium broke upon its ears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSINN FEIN, 1914-1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Mitchel had prophesied that \"in the event of a European war a strong\r\nnational party could grasp the occasion\" in Ireland, and Mitchel held too\r\nhigh a place in the estimation of Irish Nationalists for his words to have\r\nbeen forgotten or ignored. When Saurin (who, though an Orangeman and a\r\nTory and, after the Union, one of the law officers of the Crown in\r\nIreland, opposed the policy of Castlereagh) uttered his famous dictum on\r\nthe validity of the Act of Union, he provided Irish Nationalism with one\r\nof its most authoritative maxims: \"You may make the Union binding as a\r\nlaw, but you cannot make it obligatory in conscience: it will be obeyed as\r\nlong as England is strong, but resistance to it will be in the abstract a\r\nduty and the exhibition of that resistance will be a mere question of\r\nprudence.\" Irish Separatists did not always find it prudent to speak with\r\nthe precision of the future Attorney-General: but the principle which he\r\nlaid down was always understood to be one of which they acknowledged the\r\nvalidity. It had been repeated in language less classical, but equally\r\nemphatic, by Parnell and Mr. Redmond; but the occasion to put into\r\npractice the prudence of which Saurin spoke had either never come or never\r\nbeen seized. But that it would come some day and in an unquestionable\r\nshape was a maxim of the Separatists. The increasing signs of antagonism\r\nbetween England and Germany had not since the beginning of the century\r\nescaped watchful eyes in Ireland. In the year 1900 _The United Irishman_\r\nin discussing German diplomacy had referred to the alliance between Irish\r\nand Germans in the United States which (it added) \"is such a welcome\r\nfeature of contemporary politics.\" When, two years before the war, Mr.\r\nChurchill had referred in guarded language to the necessity to England of\r\na \"loyal Ireland\" in the near future, _Sinn Fein_ commented as follows on\r\nhis words: \"We have, for instance, no illusion whatever on the subject of\r\nGermany. If Germany victorious over England comes to Ireland, Germany will\r\ncome to stay and rule the Atlantic from our shores. She will give us\r\nbetter terms than England offers. She will give us that Home Rule which\r\nall the States of the German Empire enjoy.... We have no doubt whatever\r\nthat Ireland under German rule would be more prosperous than she has ever\r\nbeen under the rule of England.... The fact would not induce us to love\r\nGermany or to fight for a mere change of masters. But as a matter of\r\nbargaining we can say to Mr. Churchill, when he offers us a bogus Home\r\nRule for aiding British policy against Germany, that Ireland would get\r\nbetter terms from a successful Germany if she withheld that aid.\" This was\r\nthe language of a journal which voiced the opinions of a party definitely\r\ncommitted against an Irish policy of force: the Republican Party, not so\r\ncommitted used words less nebulous and guarded. In 1911 _Irish Freedom_,\r\nprinted a letter from John Devoy of New York, a prominent Irish-American\r\nand ex-Fenian, pointing out that a German war was coming in the near\r\nfuture, that England would need conscription before it was over, and that\r\nIreland must fight either for England or against her. A month or so later\r\nan editorial returned to the point: \"Wolfe Tone, though he appealed to\r\nFrance for aid, did not ask Irishmen to sit idly by; and the arguments\r\nTone advanced with considerable success to induce France to aid in\r\nestablishing an Irish Republic can be applied to-day in the case of\r\nGermany.\" Later in the year an article entitled \"When Germany fights\r\nEngland\" discussed the policy of Ireland, having first stipulated for her\r\ncomplete independence, throwing her weight on the side of Germany in a\r\nwar. Germany, it was thought, might play the same part as Tone had hoped\r\nthat France would play in 1798--might release Ireland from English\r\ndomination and then declare her absolute independence. No doubt seems to\r\nhave been entertained that such a policy would be acceptable to Germany;\r\nfor in Germany the Separatists saw, not an ambitious empire grasping at\r\nworld power, so much as a brave and efficient people trying to burst the\r\nbonds with which English policy, and English intrigue had surrounded them.\r\nSinn Fein had taken its official economic policy from the German List, and\r\npointed to its success in establishing German industry upon a sure\r\nfooting (in spite of the industrial rivalry of England) as an augury for\r\nIrish success and as a model for Irish effort. Germany was looked upon as\r\nthe one European nation at once bold enough and strong enough to challenge\r\nEnglish supremacy and vitally interested in challenging it effectively.\r\nFor, with Ireland in the possession of England, the key to the Atlantic\r\nwas in English hands: if Ireland were independent then the key would go to\r\nwhatever hands framed the most favourable alliance with Ireland.\r\n\r\nBut whatever the wisdom or the folly of such expectations, there is no\r\ndoubt that the Separatists looked to Germany not to annex but to free\r\nIreland. They did not desire that Germany should take Ireland from\r\nEngland; but that Germany should declare Ireland to be an independent\r\nsovereign State. Nothing less than this could have satisfied their\r\naspirations. For Germany to have offered less would not have secured their\r\nassistance; if Germany had annexed Ireland they would have welcomed a\r\ndeliverer from Germany as eagerly as a deliverer was looked for them from\r\nthe domination of England.\r\n\r\nBut in the actual circumstances that accompanied the outbreak of war in\r\n1914 there was no disposition to take sides with Germany on the merits, or\r\nto stake everything upon the success of an understanding with Germany. It\r\nis true that the official statement of the English case for the\r\ndeclaration of war was received with a certain degree of quiet scepticism.\r\nThe commercial rivalry of the two empires, the prophecies of a coming war\r\nthat had been openly made for years, the _Entente Cordiale_ with the\r\nFrench Republic, of the real meaning of which France at least made no\r\nsecret, had been too well known and had been too openly and too long\r\ncanvassed for the violation of Belgian neutrality by Germany to receive\r\nthe importance which was attributed to it or to be regarded as much more\r\nthan a blunder adroitly utilized. There was not so much sympathy with\r\nGermany as a want of sympathy with England: there was not so much a lack\r\nof sympathy with Belgium as a distrust of the appeals which were\r\ninsistently made to that feeling.\r\n\r\nWhen war was declared the Home Rule Bill had not passed into law. A great\r\neffort had been made to come to terms with the Ulster and the English Tory\r\nParties and had failed. It seemed as if the Government must either go\r\nforward with its policy and take the risks or own defeat. It was assumed\r\nas a matter of course that a foreign war ended _ipso facto_ all disputes\r\nbetween the great English parties and that till the war should be over\r\ninternal opposition to the Government should cease. But what about\r\nIreland? Would the two Irish parties sink their differences in the same\r\nway in the interest of the Empire? Would the Irish people give their\r\nwhole-hearted support and sympathy in the struggle to an England which had\r\nso far failed to satisfy what they regarded as their elementary rights?\r\nThe choice fell to Mr. Redmond. On the one hand prudence counselled the\r\nuse of a unique opportunity: he might offer Irish support in return for\r\nthe immediate enactment of Home Rule and throw upon the Ulster Party the\r\nonus of refusing to support the Empire in its deadly struggle. He might on\r\nthe other hand offer Irish support without conditions and leave the\r\nsatisfaction of the national claims of Ireland as a debt of honour to the\r\nconscience of English statesmen. Had he bargained (and got his terms)\r\nNationalist Ireland would have been with him almost to a man: with that\r\nsimplicity of character, which, as the Greek historian says, \"makes up a\r\ngreat part of good breeding,\" he promised without conditions: England\r\nmight withdraw her soldiers from Ireland; the shores of Ireland, North and\r\nSouth, would be guarded by her armed sons. The House of Commons, England\r\nand the Empire were greatly impressed: the _beau geste_ of the Irish\r\nleader was universally applauded. The Home Rule Bill was presented for the\r\nRoyal Signature and signed; a Suspensory Bill was hurried through\r\nproviding that its operation should be postponed; the Prime Minister\r\npromised the enemies of Home Rule that before it was allowed to be put\r\ninto operation the Government would introduce and pass a Bill amending the\r\nmeasure in such a way as to make it acceptable to its opponents; and Mr.\r\nRedmond hurried home to rally Ireland to the cause of the Empire. The\r\nsituation was summed up later with brutal frankness by a Belfast Unionist\r\npaper: \"If the Nationalists will not enlist because the war is just, they\r\nshould not do so because they have got Home Rule; because they have not\r\ngot it. The Unionist Party has declared that when it comes into power it\r\nwill not allow the Act to stand.\" Even so between 40,000 and 50,000 Irish\r\nNationalists joined the Forces during the first year of the war.\r\n\r\nBy the time Mr. Redmond had returned to Ireland the attitude of all Irish\r\nparties to the war had become pretty clearly defined. The Ulster\r\nVolunteers, after about a month's hesitation on the part of their leaders,\r\nhad received official intimation that they were free to enlist. Any delay\r\nthere may have been was due, not to the feelings of the rank and file, but\r\nto the tactics of the politicians, eager to extract the last possible\r\nadvantage from the situation. The bulk of the Nationalists, like the bulk\r\nof the Ulstermen, were in sympathy with the cause of England and her\r\nAllies as against Germany and the two parties sent recruits in almost\r\nequal numbers. The attitude of Sinn Fein is put so clearly in a leader in\r\nits official organ that it deserves quotation: \"Ireland is not at war with\r\nGermany: it has no quarrel with any Continental Power.... There is no\r\nEuropean Power waging war against the people of Ireland: there are two\r\nEuropean Powers at war with the people who dominate Ireland from Dublin\r\nCastle.... To-day the Irish are flattered and caressed by their libellers.\r\nEngland wants our aid and Mr. Redmond, true to his nature, rushes to offer\r\nit--for nothing.... If England wins this war she will be more powerful\r\nthan she has been at any time since 1864 and she will treat the Ireland\r\nwhich kissed the hand that smote her as such an Ireland ought to be\r\ntreated. If she loses the war, and Ireland is foolish enough to identify\r\nitself with her, Ireland will deservedly share in her punishment.... We\r\nare Irish Nationalists and the only duty we have is to stand for Ireland's\r\ninterests, irrespective of the interests of England or Germany or any\r\nforeign country.... Let it (_i.e._ the Government) withdraw the present\r\nabortive Home Rule Bill and pass ... a full measure of Home Rule and\r\nIrishmen will have some reason to mobilize for the defence of their\r\ninstitutions. At present they have none. In the alternative let a\r\nProvisional Government be set up in Dublin by Mr. Redmond and Sir Edward\r\nCarson and we shall give it allegiance. But the confidence trick has been\r\ntoo often played upon us to deceive us again. If the Irish Volunteers are\r\nto defend Ireland they must defend it for Ireland under Ireland's flag and\r\nunder Irish officers. Otherwise they will only help to perpetuate the\r\nenslavement of their country.... Germany is nothing to us in herself, but\r\nshe is not our enemy. Our blood and our miseries are not upon her head.\r\nBut who can forbear admiration at the spectacle of the Germanic people\r\nwhom England has ringed round with enemies standing alone, undaunted and\r\ndefiant against a world in arms?\" This was a clear declaration of\r\nneutrality coupled with an offer of terms of friendship. But as the\r\nnegotiations in Parliament proceeded, as it became clear that, while Home\r\nRule was nominally to be passed, no effect was to be given to it for the\r\npresent, and no permanent validity to attach to the passing of it, the\r\ntone of the Sinn Fein and Republican Press grew harder. \"If the Home Rule\r\nBill,\" said _Sinn Fein_, \"be signed, but not brought into immediate\r\noperation, by the appointment of a Home Rule Executive Government, Ireland\r\nis sold and betrayed. Let every Irishman get that into his head and keep\r\nit there.\" \"We regard no enemy of England as an enemy of ours.... It was\r\nGrattan, the greatest of our constitutional leaders, who declared that if\r\nthe interests of the Empire clashed with the liberties of Ireland, then he\r\nand every Irishman would say 'Live Ireland--perish the Empire.'\" _Irish\r\nFreedom_ which printed in capitals across its pages mottoes such as\r\n\"Germany is not Ireland's enemy,\" \"Ireland First, Last and All the Time,\"\r\nsaid, \"If England withdraws her troops utterly from Ireland the Irish\r\nVolunteers will take and hold the country, hold it not alone against\r\nGermany but against anybody else who attempts to interfere with it. And on\r\nno other conditions will the Volunteers consent to move a step.... We are\r\nnot prepared to buy even freedom--were it offered--at the price of our\r\nhonour.\" It declared that \"the psychological moment\" had arrived for the\r\nunion of Irishmen, for the attainment of Irish liberty, and proposed for\r\nthe last time a working arrangement between the Irish Volunteers and the\r\nUlster Volunteers to further the real liberties of Ireland. The Labour\r\npaper was even more outspoken. It ridiculed the parliamentary leaders for\r\ntheir lack of ability in driving a bargain as compared with the more\r\nastute Ulstermen; it ridiculed the advanced Nationalists who still talked\r\nnonsense about a junction of the two forces of Volunteers: it declared\r\nstoutly, \"If England wants an Empire, let her hold the Empire.... Let no\r\nIrishman leave his own land.... Keep your guns for your real enemies.\"\r\nWhile it deplored the success of the recruiting campaign it allowed (with,\r\nconsidering its own strongly expressed views, a commendable toleration)\r\narticles to appear from Labour men giving their reasons for supporting the\r\nwar. But it had no illusions as to what was in store in the end for\r\nIrishmen who put its ideas into practice. \"For some of us,\" James Connolly\r\nwrote, \"the finish may be on the scaffold, for some in the prison cell,\r\nfor others more fortunate upon the battlefield of an Ireland in arms for a\r\nreal republican liberty.\" But as a last resort even Connolly proposed\r\nterms of accommodation: he thought that the Volunteers by the bold policy\r\nof refusing to move until their terms were conceded might force the\r\nGovernment to repeal all clauses in the Home Rule Bill denying to Ireland\r\nthe self-government enjoyed by Canada and Australia. The last number of\r\nhis paper bore the legend \"We serve neither King nor Kaiser.\" It had been\r\ndecided by all the political parties that then seemed to count in Ireland\r\nthat Irishmen must serve, if they served at all, not because they had\r\nbeen given Home Rule but because they had not been given it--because\r\nIreland was still an integral part of the United Kingdom, bound to its\r\nfortunes till the issue of the war should be determined. Three months\r\nafter war was declared the Sinn Fein, Republican and Labour papers were\r\nsuppressed by the police.\r\n\r\nThe public discussion of the terms upon which it might have been possible\r\nto range even Separatists against Germany, the granting to Ireland of\r\nsomething of her own to defend, being thus declared not to be in the\r\npublic interest, it seemed as if no obstacle remained in the way of\r\nraising recruits all over the country. Irishmen were credited with a love\r\nof mingling in a fight without any nice discrimination as to the grounds\r\nof the quarrel or the merits of the dispute. \"Is there not wars?\" seemed\r\nto some of the authorities to be a sufficiently potent appeal. But it was\r\nfound that there existed a confused and vague feeling that England as a\r\nwhole had at last, in spite of much English opposition, come to take a\r\nfriendly view of the Irish claim to self-government; that, if the war had\r\nnot occurred when it did, some way out of the difficulty would have been\r\nfound; that the Government was honest in its intentions and could hardly\r\nbe blamed for the tactics of its opponents. Even a slight and doubtful\r\nindication of real friendliness on the part of England raises in Ireland a\r\nresponse which must often seem to be out of proportion to the cause which\r\nexcited it; and at the beginning of the war Nationalist Ireland was ready\r\nto respond to the call for men in a way which roused the cynical criticism\r\nof the advanced wing of the Nationalist Party. \"No English city,\" wrote\r\nthe _Irish Worker_ in September, 1914, \"is displaying more enthusiasm than\r\nDublin in sending its bravest and best to murder men with whom they have\r\nno quarrel.\" The Scottish Borderers, leaving for the Front, received an\r\nenthusiastic send-off from the city in which a short while before they had\r\nhad to be confined to barracks; all over the country men were flocking to\r\nrecruit in the first few weeks of the war. Anti-English feeling was\r\npractically smothered in a wave of enthusiasm. The Irish Volunteers, now\r\napparently under the assured control of the Parliamentary Party, became\r\nthe subjects of an almost embarrassing interest. Unionist peers and\r\ngentry, retired militia officers and other people, not (to say the least)\r\ndistinguished for Irish patriotism, hastened to enrol in their ranks and\r\nto proffer their services. The name of Major the Earl of Fingall appearing\r\nas Chief Inspecting Officer of the Irish Volunteers in Meath in an order\r\nsigned by Colonel Maurice Moore, \"Inspector-General, Irish Volunteers,\"\r\nwould have seemed strange six months before and stranger still a year\r\nafterwards. But it provoked little comment in August, 1914. It seemed as\r\nif a miracle were about to happen and it became the apparent business of\r\nthe authorities to take steps to secure that it should not happen.\r\n\r\nEnlistment had not been growing in popularity in Ireland for some years\r\nbefore the war. In 1908, _Sinn Fein_ had pointed out with satisfaction\r\nthat the army returns showed that the number of Irishmen in the regular\r\narmy had then fallen to the lowest point upon record. The Boer War and the\r\nanti-recruiting propaganda in Ireland had not been without their effect\r\nupon Irish feeling and the real position and work of the army in Ireland\r\nhad been closely scrutinized. \"The Curragh Mutiny\" had provoked some very\r\npointed comments upon the spirit which really animated the army in\r\nIreland: it came to be looked upon as the citadel and symbol of all the\r\nforces that opposed the claims of Ireland. \"We all know in our hearts,\"\r\nsaid Roger Casement and Eoin MacNeill in a manifesto published in April,\r\n1914, in the _Irish Volunteer_, \"that the 'Union' means the military\r\noccupation of Ireland as a conquered country: that the real headquarters\r\nof Irish government on the Unionist principle is the Curragh Camp to which\r\nthe offices of Dublin Castle are only a sort of vermiform appendix.\" And\r\nthe functions performed by the army in Ireland would certainly have seemed\r\nstrange to anyone who felt any attachment to the views generally accepted\r\nin England as to the relation of the army to the civil power. In the\r\nGeneral Orders for the guidance of the troops affording aid to the Civil\r\nPower in Ireland, issued in 1891, the following paragraph is to be found:\r\n\"All officers in command of corps or detachments are to transmit to the\r\nDeputy Adjutant General an immediate report of any outrages, large\r\nmeetings held or expected to be held for political or other purposes, or\r\noccurrences that may take place in the neighbourhood of their posts\r\nconnected with the state of the country, whether they have or have not\r\nbeen called upon to afford assistance to the civil power.\" The functions\r\nof an army acting upon instructions like these are hardly to be\r\ndistinguished from those of an army of occupation, and Nationalist Ireland\r\nwas well aware of the efficiency with which these functions were\r\nperformed. To make enlistment popular in Ireland, even in a moment of\r\nenthusiasm, was thus a work requiring a certain amount of tact and\r\ndiscretion.\r\n\r\nThe first real difficulty arose with the Volunteers, whose services as an\r\narmy of defence had been pledged by Mr. Redmond to the Government. The\r\npledge had been given without the consent, or even the knowledge, of the\r\nVolunteer Committee and they resented the implication that they could be\r\ndisposed of as if they were the private property of other people. They had\r\nbeen enrolled with a definite object and any duty for which their services\r\nwere to be given must be shown to be at least not inconsistent with that\r\nobject. The committee, however, so far endorsed Mr. Redmond's offer as to\r\npass a resolution declaring \"the complete readiness of the Irish\r\nVolunteers to take joint action with the Ulster Volunteer Force for the\r\ndefence of Ireland.\" The Prime Minister promised in Parliament that the\r\nSecretary for War would \"do everything in his power, after consultation\r\nwith gentlemen in Ireland, to arrange for the full equipment and\r\norganization of the Irish Volunteers.\" Whether the powers of the Secretary\r\nfor War were less extensive than the Prime Minister believed, or whether\r\nthe \"gentlemen in Ireland\" had other views, the scheme drawn up by General\r\nSir Arthur Paget and his staff \"by which the War Office may be supplied\r\nfrom the Irish Volunteers with a force for the defence of Ireland\" was\r\nrejected by the War Office. This, it is true, made little difference in\r\nthe end, for the Volunteer Committee, when the scheme was submitted to\r\nthem, demanded the inclusion of certain \"primary conditions\" which it was\r\nnot at all likely that the War Office would have accepted: but the\r\nimmediate rejection of it by the military authorities in England is\r\nsignificant of the spirit in which the question of Irish recruiting was\r\napproached. It was hostile not only to Irish ideals but to Irish\r\nsentiment, to everything except the use to which Irish soldiers might be\r\nput. The contrast between the treatment accorded to Irish Nationalist\r\nrecruits and the privileges granted to the Ulster Division can only be\r\nexplained on the assumption that the War Office desired to show\r\nappreciation of the latter and suspicion of the former. The Ulster men\r\nwere allowed to retain their own officers and their own tests of\r\nadmission: the \"regiments\" formed under the Provisional Government of\r\nUlster were taken over, without alteration, by the English authorities:\r\nthey were allowed to refuse Catholics or Nationalists who offered to\r\nenlist in their ranks: their recruiting marches were accompanied by bands\r\nwho played Orange party tunes through Catholic and Nationalist hamlets\r\nwhile they went through the farce of lecturing the inhabitants on their\r\n\"duty to the Empire in this crisis.\" In November, 1914, an advertisement\r\nappeared in the Dublin _Evening Mail_ announcing that a new Dublin Company\r\nof the Royal Irish Fusiliers was to be formed to which none but Unionists\r\nwere admissible, intending recruits being directed to apply at the Orange\r\nHall. The Ulster Force was trained as a body in camps of its own, while\r\nUlster Nationalists had to take train for the South or were shipped to\r\nEngland. Similar privileges were bluntly and persistently refused to the\r\nNationalists. The Ulstermen had their own banners: the Nationalists might\r\nnot fight under any emblem but the Union Jack, the symbol of the defeat of\r\ntheir nationality, of the very Act of Union against which they were known\r\nto be in protest. Treatment such as this could have only one result: the\r\npeople who decided upon it must have known what the result would be, and\r\nby persisting in it showed that the result was desired. By cooling down\r\nthe enthusiasm of Nationalist Ireland they made it possible to declare\r\nthat Nationalist Ireland was \"disappointing expectations\" and to hint that\r\nthey had suspected all along that it was less eager to fight than had\r\nappeared. Incidentally the result was held to justify the suspicions which\r\nhad brought it about. Irish soldiers were divided into two categories:\r\nthose whom the authorities delighted to honour and those whom they decided\r\nto employ. It must be added that these manufactured animosities faded away\r\nin the stress of battle. Ulstermen and Nationalists fighting side by side\r\ncovered themselves with glory and did equal credit to the old land; and no\r\nmore stringent criticisms of the treacherous and malignant policy that\r\ndivided them can be heard than from the lips of some of the men who\r\nsurvived the glorious ordeal of the Somme.\r\n\r\nBut an influential body had from the first decided that the duty of\r\nIrishmen, and especially of Irish Volunteers, was to remain in Ireland;\r\nthese were the members of the original Volunteer Committee and their\r\nadherents: outside the Volunteer ranks they were supported by Sinn Fein,\r\nthe Republican Party and the Citizen Army. To them the supreme and\r\nimmediate duty of Irishmen, and in a special degree of the Volunteers, was\r\nto safeguard the liberties of Ireland--a duty to which the fact of a\r\nEuropean war was irrelevant, except in so far as it might afford an\r\nopportunity to strengthen and secure Irish liberty. There is little doubt\r\nthat some members of this party hoped that Germany would be victorious,\r\nnot in the interests of Germany but in the interests of Ireland, which had\r\nlittle prospect of winning concessions from an England rendered invincible\r\nby the overthrow of her most formidable rival: some of them regarded the\r\nwar as a mere struggle for commercial supremacy in which Ireland had no\r\ninterest at stake: but they would all alike have defended the shores of\r\nIreland against a German army which invaded them for the purposes of\r\nannexation and conquest. To all alike the proposition that Irishmen had\r\nany duty to enlist for foreign service in the English army was a denial of\r\nthe very fundamental article of their creed. When Mr. Redmond, then, in\r\nhis address to the Volunteers at Woodenbridge in September, 1914, urged\r\nthem to enlist for service overseas the inevitable crisis was provoked.\r\nBut the original provisional committee were now in a minority in the\r\ncounsels of the organization they had founded, and they were hampered by a\r\nfundamental (and, indeed, intentional) ambiguity in the Volunteer pledge.\r\n\"The rights and liberties common to all Irishmen\" was not a phrase which\r\ncarried its interpretation on its face. It was open to the Volunteer\r\nfollowers of Mr. Redmond to say that the democracy of Great Britain had\r\nconferred upon Ireland a \"charter of liberty\" and that it was the duty of\r\nIrishmen to fight for Great Britain, keeping faith with those who had kept\r\nfaith with them. It was open to others to say that \"the Thing on the\r\nStatute Book\" fell far short of conferring upon Irishmen the rights and\r\nliberties to which they were entitled, and that the duty to secure first\r\nthat to which they were entitled precluded them from the prior performance\r\nof any other task. The members of the original committee who took the\r\nlatter view could also urge that Mr. Redmond's original pledge that the\r\nVolunteers would \"defend the shores of Ireland\" was not capable of the\r\ngloss that \"the shores of Ireland\" under the circumstances was a\r\nlegitimate figure of speech for the trenches in the front line in France.\r\nThe difference of interpretation developed into a split. The members of\r\nthe original committee met in September and called a Volunteer Convention\r\nfor November 25, 1914, at which it was decided \"to declare that Ireland\r\ncannot with honour or safety take part in foreign quarrels otherwise than\r\nthrough the free action of a National Government of her own; and to\r\nrepudiate the claim of any man to offer up the blood and lives of the sons\r\nof Irishmen and Irishwomen to the services of the British Empire while no\r\nNational Government which could act and speak for the people of Ireland is\r\nallowed to exist.\"\r\n\r\nBefore the split the Volunteers had numbered about 150,000; and it would\r\nappear that the great majority of these at first sided with Mr. Redmond.\r\nMany of them enlisted: many of them, under the title of the National\r\nVolunteers, continued to exist as a separate body in Ireland: some at\r\nleast of them afterwards found their way back into the ranks of the Irish\r\nVolunteers.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of the Volunteer split the air was cleared politically in\r\nIreland: for the first time people began to know precisely where they\r\nstood. The National Volunteers and the Parliamentary Party under Mr.\r\nRedmond's leadership were committed, as were the Unionists, to the\r\nunreserved and energetic prosecution of the war: all the other parties,\r\nSinn Fein, the Republicans, the Irish Volunteers, and the Citizen Army\r\nadopted an attitude of watchful neutrality. Their view was bounded by the\r\nshores of Ireland or when they cast a glance abroad it was as the\r\nhusbandman observes the clouds. They continued to differ (sometimes\r\nsharply and vehemently) from one another: but the public, with a prophetic\r\ndisregard of the mere obvious present, began to label them\r\nindiscriminately as Sinn Feiners. In truth common adversity was drawing\r\nthem closer together, and the apparently heterogeneous elements which went\r\nto make up the Sinn Fein of present-day Ireland were being welded into a\r\nunity of aim and resolution.\r\n\r\nThe results were soon apparent. During the month or so when the Volunteers\r\nenjoyed the fleeting sunlight of aristocratic favour, the Foreign Office\r\nhad written (18th August, 1914) to H.B.M. Consul-General at Antwerp to\r\nassist Mr. John O'Connor, M.P., and Mr. H. J. Harris in arranging for the\r\nshipment to Ireland of certain rifles belonging to the Volunteers,\r\npermission to export them having been obtained from the Belgian Government\r\nby the Foreign Office. It was, no doubt, an oversight that no ammunition\r\nfor them was obtained, or could be obtained afterwards; but the rifles\r\ncame. Three months later an officer of the Volunteers who was employed in\r\nthe Ordnance Survey was dismissed without charge or notice and ordered to\r\nleave Dublin within twenty-four hours. He was only the first of a series\r\nof Volunteer organizers who suffered deportation under similar\r\ncircumstances. The Birmingham factory which was engaged in making guns for\r\nthe Volunteers was raided, its books and correspondence seized, and it was\r\nordered not to remove any goods from its premises. To be an Irish\r\nVolunteer was to be \"disaffected,\" and to be \"disaffected\" was to be\r\nliable to summary measures of repression.\r\n\r\nThe autumn of 1914 saw the appearance of a new Separatist paper,\r\n_Eire-Ireland_, which appeared as a weekly on October 26th and was changed\r\nto a daily after the second number. It is significant of the change in\r\nIrish feeling that it was now possible to run a Separatist daily paper in\r\nDublin, and of the gradual rapprochement between Irish parties that this\r\npaper, intended as the organ of the Irish Volunteers, was edited by Mr.\r\nArthur Griffith, the founder of the Sinn Fein movement. Its attitude\r\ntowards the war was defined in an article by Roger Casement in the first\r\nnumber: \"Ireland has no quarrel with the German people or just cause of\r\noffence against them.... Ireland has suffered at the hands of British\r\nadministrators a more prolonged series of evils deliberately inflicted\r\nthan any other community of civilized men.\" It emphasized the view of the\r\nVolunteers that Mr. Redmond's advice to take their place in the firing\r\nline was out of harmony with their principles. \"The Irish Volunteers had\r\nfrom the beginning and still have but a single duty--to secure and\r\nsafeguard the rights and liberties of Ireland.\" The new daily contained a\r\ncolumn \"The War Day by Day\" in which a critical analysis of the military\r\nsituation was attempted. While most of the other Irish papers merely\r\nreproduced the amateur war criticisms of Fleet Street, the editor of\r\n_Eire_, assuming that English newspapers were giving only one side of the\r\ncase, attempted an independent study of the situation, which was made to\r\nappear much less favourable to the Allies than was asserted by other Irish\r\npapers. Stories of German atrocities were analyzed and ridiculed. The\r\nfortunes of the Irish regiments were followed with a jealous eye: it was\r\nasserted that they were being sacrificed unnecessarily while English\r\nregiments were spared, and the Government was challenged to prepare and\r\npublish complete casualty lists for the Irish regiments of the line. The\r\nprotest of the German professors against the alleged Allied calumnies was\r\nprinted in full and annotated with sympathy. The assurance given to Roger\r\nCasement by the German Acting-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs as to\r\nthe contemplated action of German troops if they should land in Ireland\r\nwas printed as a document of first-rate international importance. It was\r\nassumed that the Ballot Act would be enforced in Ireland and passive\r\nresistance to its enforcement was urged from the first number of the\r\npaper. _Eire_ did not run for much more than six weeks. Its last number\r\n(December 4) was a broad sheet announcing that the printer, whose premises\r\nhad been entered by a military force which had confiscated his property,\r\nfelt unable to continue the printing of the paper.\r\n\r\n_Eire_ did not so much make, as voice, the opinions of a considerable\r\nsection of Irish Nationalist opinion. The newspapers were scanned eagerly\r\nevery morning all over Ireland for tidings of the Irish regiments. It was\r\nknown that they were engaged, that they were outnumbered, that they would\r\nfight like lions (\"the Gaels went out to battle but they always fell\"): a\r\ndisquieting and ominous silence reigned as to their fate. It was assumed\r\nthat the news was bad and that it was being kept back: it began to be\r\nasserted that they were being put upon forlorn hopes to spare the more\r\nvalued English regiments: and even those who did not credit the suspicion\r\nfelt uneasy when it was expressed. It may have been necessary to refrain\r\nfrom telling the whole truth in official reports, but every course has its\r\ndisadvantages and, so far as Ireland was concerned, this had the result of\r\narousing suspicion and distrust. And to the question \"Why, if these men\r\ncan fight and die for the freedom of others, are they not considered\r\nworthy of the freedom they desire for themselves?\" the answers did not\r\ncarry conviction.\r\n\r\nThe official \"War News\" printed in the Irish papers was read with\r\ndetachment and reserve; stories of German atrocities were received with\r\nunimpressionable scepticism. This was not due to any pro-German bias, or\r\nto any Sinn Fein propaganda. Peasants in remote villages who never saw\r\nany paper but an odd copy of the _Freeman's Journal_ or the _Irish Daily\r\nIndependent_, and who were Redmondites to a man, discussed these matters\r\nwith a completely open mind, and with (to those who did not know them)\r\nsurprising acumen. People accustomed for years to read that their county\r\nor their province, in which some unpopular grazier had been boycotted, was\r\n\"seething with outrage and disorder,\" to be told that a district in which\r\nthere was known not to be as much crime in a year as there was in an\r\nEnglish district of the same size every month was \"in a state bordering on\r\nalmost complete lawlessness,\" were not moved when the Germans were charged\r\non the same authority with crimes against civilization. The word of \"our\r\nEnglish correspondent\" was simply \"not evidence\" against anybody. This\r\ninvincible scepticism, born of experience, was quite wrongly interpreted\r\nas being the result of \"pro-German\" sympathies when it proved an\r\nunexpected obstacle to the recruiting campaign.\r\n\r\nThe gradual growth of Sinn Fein and anti-English (which was only\r\naccidentally and not on principle pro-German) sentiment during the war,\r\nand the increasing difficulties found in the way of the recruiting\r\ncampaign, were due mainly to a growing disbelief in the sincerity of\r\nEnglish statesmen in their dealings with Ireland. The Government had gone\r\ntoo far in the direction of Home Rule to make Unionists sure that the\r\npromised Amending Bill would secure that they should not be \"coerced\": it\r\nhad not gone far enough to make Nationalists sure that it really meant to\r\ndo what it had promised. The result was the conviction upon all hands that\r\ntheir rights must be secured by their own efforts not by reliance upon the\r\nlukewarm sympathy of others. This conviction was not a matter of a sudden\r\ngrowth nor did it always find expression in the same way: it acted at once\r\nin favour of, and to the detriment of, recruiting: it was professed both\r\nby Nationalists and by Unionists. At first recruits joined because the war\r\nwas just, because the Empire was in danger, because England had granted\r\nIreland a \"charter of liberty,\" because the civilization of Europe was\r\nthreatened, because there was fighting afoot. Probably the majority\r\nenlisted for one or other of these reasons. But the theory of \"a free gift\r\nof a free people\" expounded by Mr. Asquith in Dublin fell more and more\r\ninto the background. It began to be represented on both sides that the\r\nmore recruits either party sent to the war the stronger would be the lien\r\nof that party upon the sympathy of the English Government. Unionists whose\r\nblood had flowed for England in Flanders could not be abandoned after such\r\na sacrifice: Nationalists who had given their best and bravest to the\r\ncause of freedom could not be denied the freedom for which such a price\r\nhad been paid. The official recruiting campaign wavered in its appeal\r\nbetween the two points. Its minor ineptitudes need hardly be taken into\r\naccount. It was hardly politic to cover the walls of police barracks in\r\nProtestant villages in Ulster with green placards drawing attention to a\r\nfew weighty words of Cardinal Logue: these follies did neither harm nor\r\ngood. But it was different when appeals to the chivalry and bravery of\r\nIrishmen alternated with deductions from the famous phrase about \"the\r\nrights of small nations.\" When Irish Nationalists were implored to rally\r\nto the defence of the Friend of Little Nations the size of Ireland was not\r\nlikely to be forgotten. The inference that in fighting for the liberties\r\nof small nations Irishmen would be helping their own nation to secure the\r\nsame liberty was the inference intended: but it was not always the\r\ninference actually drawn. The person who first conceived the idea of\r\nmaking use of that phrase for recruiting purposes in Ireland did the cause\r\nof recruiting an unforeseen but serious disservice. Was it, after all,\r\nreally true (it was asked) that England could not recognize the freedom of\r\nIreland until Ireland had first helped England to force Germany to\r\nrecognize the freedom of Belgium? Was the freedom of Ireland then not a\r\nmatter of right but the result of a bargain--the equivalent of how many\r\nfighting men? Had England been the friend of small nations before the war,\r\nwas she to be their friend during the war, or was Ireland only to help her\r\nto be their friend after the war was over? The right of Ireland to more\r\nfreedom than she had enjoyed had seemed to be recognized before the war\r\nhad been spoken of; what had become of the recognition of it? And even\r\nbargaining, however distasteful, has its usages: it was no bargain when\r\none side was called upon to pay up and the other carefully refrained from\r\npromising anything definite in return.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the recruits enlisted during the first year of the war, and\r\nenlisted for worthy and honourable motives: when recruiting became, as it\r\ndid become later, a question of party tactics the results were less\r\nfavourable. But quite early in the war it became plain that there was\r\ngoing to be a contest between the two Irish parties as to which should\r\nhave most to show for itself at the end, and there was no burning desire\r\nto assist political opponents to obtain recruits. Sir Edward Carson\r\nrefused absolutely to stand on the same recruiting platform as Mr.\r\nRedmond; the Belfast Unionist papers found it a grave lapse from principle\r\nin the present Lord Chancellor of England that he addressed a recruiting\r\nmeeting in Liverpool in the company of Home Rulers. The Ulster Volunteer\r\nForce was informed practically that it had a two-fold duty, to fight for\r\nthe Empire abroad, and to keep up the organization at home. It was plain\r\nfrom the first that in Ireland there was to be no \"party truce,\" and it\r\nwas recognized on all hands before long that when the war was over the old\r\nfight was to be renewed. The position of the Home Rule Act, penned in the\r\nStatute Book, with an Amending Bill waiting to tear it to pieces when the\r\ntime came for it to be allowed out, made this inevitable. And the\r\nGovernment did not find it in its heart to hold an even balance between\r\nthe parties: and when the balance began to dip the end was in sight for\r\nthose who had eyes to see.\r\n\r\nThe only party really able to turn to account the situation thus created\r\nwas the Sinn Fein party. It had preached for years that the English\r\ngoverning classes, indeed the English nation, were not, in spite of their\r\napparent readiness to listen to the Parliamentary Party, the friends of\r\nIrish Nationalism in any real sense: that they had no intention (and never\r\nhad) of satisfying the just claims of Ireland: that the Parliamentarians\r\nwere mere pawns in a party game, to be sacrificed when it suited both or\r\neither of the English parties: that the word of English statesmen could\r\nnot be trusted, and that Ireland had nothing to gain from them: that\r\nself-reliance, vigilance and distrust of England were \"the sinews of good\r\nsense\" in Irish politics. It had hinted, not obscurely, that the\r\nopportunity of Ireland would come when England should be involved in a\r\nEuropean war, and that Ireland must be prepared when the day came to use\r\nthe opportunity. It now pointed a triumphant finger to what was going on\r\nin Ireland and asked which had been the truer prophet, itself or the\r\nParliamentary Party. It quoted the returns of recruiting in Ulster in\r\nsupport of its thesis: \"The fact that out of 200,000 Unionists of military\r\nage in Ireland--men who talked Empire, sang Empire and protested they\r\nwould die for the British Empire--four out of every five are still at\r\nhome, declaring they will not have Home Rule, is proof that the Irish\r\nUnionist knows his present business.\" That Irish soldiers were to be used\r\nto further English interests, and not the cause of Ireland, was (it held)\r\nproved by extracts from English newspapers, where in unguarded moments the\r\nnaked truth peeped out: it gave prominence to a quotation from the\r\n_Liverpool Post_ of September 12, 1914: \"His Majesty could make a\r\ntriumphal tour of Ireland, North, South, East and West, and in reply to\r\nhis personal appeal, there would be 300,000 Irishmen of all creeds and\r\nclasses for the Front in less than a week. In England the question becomes\r\nmore and more important in the interests of the efficiency of our trade,\r\nwhether we can spare any more skilled mechanics for the ranks of battle.\r\nThe capture of the German trade is almost as vital to the existence of the\r\nEmpire as the destruction of Prussian militarism.\"\r\n\r\nBy the end of 1914 all avowedly Sinn Fein papers had been suppressed, and\r\nthe two American papers, the _Gaelic American_ and the _Irish World_, had\r\nbeen prohibited in Ireland. The latter had been a supporter of Mr.\r\nRedmond's policy but had parted company with him on the question of\r\nrecruiting in Ireland. The editor of _Sinn Fein_ countered the suppression\r\nof his paper by an ingenious device. He began to publish a bi-weekly\r\ncalled _Scissors and Paste_, which contained nothing but extracts from\r\nother English, Irish, Colonial and American papers. It was introduced to\r\nthe reader in the only editorial it contained, entitled \"Ourselves\": \"It\r\nis high treason,\" it ran, \"for an Irishman to argue with the sword the\r\nright of his small nationality to equal political freedom with Belgium or\r\nServia or Hungary. It is destruction to the property of his printer now\r\nwhen he argues it with the pen. Hence while England is fighting the battle\r\nof the Small Nationalities, _Ireland_ is reduced to _Scissors and Paste_.\r\nUp to the present the sale and use of these instruments have not been\r\nprohibited by the British Government in Ireland.\" The columns of the\r\n_Times_, the _Daily Mail_, and the _Morning Post_ supplied the German\r\nWireless messages: the _New York Times_ was drawn upon for James O'Donnell\r\nBennett's articles protesting against the reports of German atrocities. In\r\naddition it printed suitable extracts from _The Reliques of Father Prout_,\r\nfrom Barry's _Songs of Ireland_, Thomas Davis's _Essays_ and Sir Samuel\r\nFerguson: it reprinted Curran's speech in defence of the printer of _The\r\nPress_ in 1797. It ransacked the _Daily Mail_ for that journal's vigorous\r\ndenunciations of the French in 1899: \"If they cannot cease their insults\r\ntheir colonies will be taken from them and given to Germany and Italy--we\r\nourselves want nothing more.... France will be rolled in the blood and mud\r\nin which her Press daily wallows.\" The paper ran for a little over a\r\nmonth. Its undoing was an extract from the _Irish Times_, a copy of a\r\nnotice posted on a Sunday morning in January, 1915, in places near a\r\nnumber of Roman Catholic churches in Wexford: \"People of Wexford, take no\r\nnotice of the police order to destroy your own property and leave your\r\nown homes if a German army lands in Ireland. When the Germans come they\r\nwill come as friends and to put an end to English rule in Ireland.\r\nTherefore stay in your homes and assist as far as possible the German\r\ntroops. Any stores, hay, corn or forage taken by the Germans will be paid\r\nfor by them.\"\r\n\r\nJust before the disappearance of _Scissors and Paste_, the _Irish Worker_,\r\nthree weeks after its suppression, appeared again in Glasgow, where it was\r\nprinted by the Socialist Labour Party, and began to circulate once more in\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\nAfter five months Mr. Arthur Griffith was again able to start a paper. The\r\nDublin printers could not be induced to take the risk of printing for him\r\nagain: but Belfast supplied one with the necessary enterprise. On June 19,\r\n1915, _Nationality_ appeared as a penny weekly paper and continued to\r\nappear until the Easter Rising in 1916. In tone _Nationality_ was a\r\nreproduction of its predecessors and as the main characteristic of Sinn\r\nFein propaganda was its directness and simplicity two extracts from its\r\ncolumns will suffice. An editorial (signed C.) on \"The Fenian Faith\"\r\nwritten towards the end of 1915 contains the following: \"The Fenians and\r\nthe Fenian faith incarnated in Allen, Larkin and O'Brien were of a\r\nfighting and revolutionary epoch. They can only be commemorated by men of\r\nanother fighting and revolutionary generation. That generation we have\r\nwith us to-day. For we have the material, the men and stuff of war, the\r\nfaith and purpose and cause for revolution.... We shall have Ireland\r\nillumined with a light before which even the Martyrs' will pale: the light\r\nof Freedom, of a deed done and action taken and a blow struck for the Old\r\nLand\"; and a month or so later: \"The things that count in Ireland against\r\nEnglish Conscription are national determination, serviceable weapons and\r\nthe knowledge of how to use them.\" Under the stress of circumstances Sinn\r\nFein seemed to have abandoned the policy of the days of peace and to have\r\ncome round in time of war to the policy which, even two years before the\r\nwar, had been enunciated in _Irish Freedom_: \"Ireland can be freed by\r\nforce of arms; _that_ is the fact which ever must be borne in mind. The\r\nresponsibility rests with the men of this generation. They can strike with\r\ninfinitely greater hopes of success than could their fathers and their\r\ngrandsires: but if they let this chance slip ... if they strike no blow\r\nfor their country, whilst England herself is in handgrips with the most\r\npowerful nation in Europe, then the opportunity will have passed and\r\nIreland will be more utterly under the heel of England than ever she was\r\nsince the Union.\" This was written in September, 1912. But the task of\r\nputting the policy into practice, of welding the (at times) discordant\r\nelements of anti-Parliamentarian Nationalism together and making possible\r\na united effort was reserved for other hands and another mind than those\r\nof the founder of Sinn Fein.\r\n\r\nDuring the vigorous years of its youth Sinn Fein had not confined its\r\npropagandist activities to public meetings, the foundation of branches\r\nand the publication of a paper. The National Council of Sinn Fein had\r\nissued a series of \"National Council Pamphlets\" dealing with those aspects\r\nof Sinn Fein policy upon which the public seemed to require instruction.\r\nThe first of these was a general exposition of the Sinn Fein policy by Mr.\r\nGriffith. Others were \"The Purchase of the Railways,\" \"England's Colossal\r\nRobbery of Ireland,\" a study of the financial relations between the two\r\ncountries since the Act of Union, \"Ireland and the British Armed Forces,\"\r\n\"Constitutionalism and Sinn Fein\" and \"How Ireland is Taxed,\" an\r\nexposition of the fact (often ignored) that under the Union Ireland is the\r\nmost heavily taxed country in Europe. Finally, in 1912, a pamphlet by Mr.\r\nGriffith, \"The Home Rule Bill Examined,\" was a general review of the\r\npowers conferred and withheld by the Home Rule Bill and an examination of\r\nthe real bearing of that measure upon the political and economic situation\r\nof Ireland. The increasing difficulties which attended the publication of\r\na newspaper during the war, the increased demand for information upon the\r\nsituation created by it, the increasing number of those who felt that they\r\nhad something to say which required more space than could be afforded in a\r\nnewspaper, led to a revival of the publication of pamphlets. Early in 1915\r\na series of \"Tracts for the Times\" was projected by the Irish Publicity\r\nLeague. The first of these was a tract \"What Emmet means in 1915,\"\r\nsignificant of the direction in which minds were turning at the time. It\r\nwas followed by \"Shall Ireland be Divided?\" an impassioned protest against\r\nthe policy of partition and by \"The Secret History of the Irish\r\nVolunteers\" (which ran through several editions), an account by The\r\nO'Rahilly of the formation of the Volunteers, their policy, their attempts\r\nto secure arms and their relations with the Parliamentary Party. The\r\ntraditional Sinn Fein view was enforced in \"When the Government Publishes\r\nSedition,\" an analysis of the official census returns, showing that under\r\nthe Union the population of Ireland had been reduced by one-half, and in\r\ntwo pamphlets on \"Daniel O'Connell and Sinn Fein\" an attempt was made to\r\ncommend the policy by an argument that O'Connell both in his methods and\r\nhis aims was really a Sinn Feiner, and by an exposition (\"How Ireland is\r\nPlundered\") of the question of the Financial Relations in O'Connell's day\r\nand since. Other pamphlets were \"What it Feels Like\" on the prison\r\nexperiences of the writer who had been imprisoned under the Defence of the\r\nRealm Act for his political activities, \"Ascendancy While You Wait\" and\r\n\"Why the Martyrs of Manchester Died.\" During the same time the Cumann na\r\nmBan, the women's branch of the Irish Volunteers, added to their\r\nactivities the publication of a \"National Series\" of pamphlets \"Why\r\nIreland is Poor--English Laws and Irish Industries,\" \"Dean Swift on the\r\nSituation\" and \"The Spanish War,\" a reprint of a pamphlet published in\r\n1790 by Wolfe Tone, urging the Irish Parliament to take into account in\r\nthe consideration of the threatened war with Spain solely and simply the\r\ninterests of Ireland, the only interests which it should allow itself to\r\nconsider. The Committee of Public Safety also in 1915 published a pamphlet\r\non \"The Defence of the Realm Act in Ireland\" showing how the Act was\r\nadministered for the suppression of Nationalist propaganda. The speech\r\nwhich Mr. F. Sheehy-Skeffington delivered in the dock when charged under\r\nthe same Act with interfering with recruiting was published as a pamphlet\r\nabout the same time. The articles contributed to _Irish Freedom_ by P. H.\r\nPearse were reprinted under the title of \"From a Hermitage\" in the autumn\r\nof 1915 as one of the \"Bodenstown Series\" of pamphlets, the first of which\r\nhad been Mr. Pearse's \"How Does She Stand?\" a reprint of two speeches\r\ndelivered in America in 1914 at Emmet Commemorations in New York and\r\nBrooklyn and of the eloquent speech delivered at the grave of Wolfe Tone\r\nin Bodenstown Churchyard in 1913. The funeral of O'Donovan Rossa in\r\nAugust, 1915, also produced some pamphlets on Rossa's life and his\r\nsignificance as a Fenian leader and a protagonist of the Irish Republican\r\ncause. These pamphlets, and others, had a wide circulation; they were\r\neagerly discussed, especially among young Nationalists; they widened the\r\nrift between the Parliamentary Party and their opponents, and had much to\r\ndo with the shaping of Irish Nationalist opinion.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the activities of the Irish Volunteers continued. The secession\r\nafter the dispute with Mr. Redmond had withdrawn a large majority of their\r\noriginal numbers: indeed some authorities go so far as to say that\r\nimmediately after the formation of the National Volunteers, the original\r\ncommittee could not count upon a following of more than 10,000 or 12,000\r\nmen. Be this as it may, the arrest and deportation of several of their\r\norganizers, the constant supervision over their proceedings exercised by\r\nthe police authorities and the sure drift of Nationalist opinion away from\r\nthe Parliamentarians and their policy, not (it is true) so marked then as\r\nto cause serious official misgiving, tended to increase their prestige and\r\npopularity. The funds had for the most part gone with the National\r\nVolunteers, but the Irish in America, who sided not with Mr. Redmond but\r\nwith the Irish Volunteers, supplied large sums of money for equipment and\r\norganization. The report of the Second Annual Convention held in November,\r\n1915, contains a speech by the President on the history and aims of the\r\nmovement which concluded: \"Further I will only say that we ought all to\r\nadhere faithfully and strictly to the objects, the constitution and the\r\npolicy which we have adopted. We will not be diverted from our work by\r\ntactics of provocation. We will not give way to irritation or excitement.\r\nOur business is not to make a show or indulge in demonstrations. We\r\nstarted out on a course of constructive work requiring a long period of\r\npatient and tenacious exertion. When things were going most easily for\r\nus, I never shrank from telling my comrades that success might require\r\nyears of steady perseverance--a prospect sometimes harder to face than an\r\nenemy in the field.... Great progress has been made, more must be made.\r\nThe one thing we must look to is that there shall be no stopping and no\r\nturning back.\" There were at this time over 200 corps of the Irish\r\nVolunteers in active training and the movement was spreading, if not\r\nrapidly, yet quietly and surely. The leaders waited for time to do its\r\nwork, to bring fully home to Irish Nationalists the difference between a\r\npolicy in which the necessities of Empire held the first place and one in\r\nwhich the claims of Ireland were supreme: meanwhile it was intended that\r\nthe Volunteers should act as \"a national defence force for Ireland, for\r\nall Ireland and for Ireland only,\" ready to ward off any assault upon\r\nIrish liberty, but resolved not to provoke or to invite attack.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of official policies and intentions there had slowly been\r\nformed a small but determined minority in Ireland who looked to revolution\r\nas the only sure and manly policy for a nation pledged to freedom. This,\r\nthe creed of the Fenians, had not been openly avowed in Ireland for almost\r\nhalf a century: Nationalists had come to regard it either as a forlorn\r\nhope, a gallant but hopeless adventure, or as a policy out of harmony with\r\nmodern civilization and progress. Here and there a lonely but picturesque\r\nfigure might be seen, \"an old Fenian,\" in the world but not of it, who\r\nspoke with a resigned contempt of the new men and the new methods, an\r\ninspiration but hardly an example to the younger generation. There was\r\nstill in existence the Irish Republican Brotherhood, an obscure and\r\nelusive body, mysterious as the Rosicrucians and to all outward\r\nappearances of hardly any more political importance. A secret but\r\napparently innocuous correspondence was understood to be kept up by them\r\nwith America where, among an important and influential section of the\r\nexpatriated Irish, the hope was more widely and more openly cherished of a\r\nday when Ireland would shake off the lethargy of a generation and revert\r\nto the age-long claim for independence. For a short time it seemed as if\r\nthe prospect of the grant of Home Rule would quench the last embers of the\r\nrevolutionary fire, as if the English democracy had at last stretched out\r\na friendly hand and that the rest would be the work of time. Ulster's\r\nappeal to arms quickened the embers to a flame; in less than two years'\r\ntime a revolution was spoken of more openly than had been the case for\r\nfifty years. No man in Ireland would have taken up arms to secure Home\r\nRule: it was a \"concession\" which to some Nationalists seemed the greatest\r\nthat could be obtained, to others (and perhaps the majority) to be a step\r\nupon the road to a larger independence: both sections were agreed that it\r\nshould be sought by constitutional methods. But force might be the only\r\nmeans of retaining what it had been proper to secure without it, and the\r\nIrish Volunteers were prepared to fight those who attempted to take from\r\nthe people of Ireland any right which they had been able to secure.\r\n\r\nBut it was not to be expected that the purely defensive policy of the\r\nVolunteers would commend itself to all sections of Nationalist opinion nor\r\ncould the formula of their association produce more than an outward and\r\nseeming unity. So much had been true before the war; and when Europe was\r\ninvolved in strife, when the issue between England with her Allies and the\r\nCentral Powers seemed to hang in the balance, a purely defensive and\r\nwaiting policy seemed to be a criminal neglect of the opportunity offered\r\nby Providence. Mitchel's prophecy of the fortune that a continental war\r\nmight bring to Ireland seemed about to be fulfilled, unless the arm of\r\nIreland should prove nerveless and impotent. Not alone in Ireland were\r\nvoices raised to point the lesson: the Irish in America who still\r\nprofessed the Fenian faith urged insistently the use of the opportunity.\r\nTwo books written by James K. Maguire and printed by the Wolfe Tone\r\nPublishing Co. of New York, \"What Could Germany do for Ireland?\" and \"The\r\nKing, the Kaiser and Irish Freedom\" had a considerable circulation in\r\nIreland during 1915 and 1916. Written by an Irish-American who had been\r\neducated at a German school in Syracuse, and was well known for his German\r\nsympathies, they boldly announced that in a German victory lay the only\r\nhope for the establishment of an Irish Republic. They asserted not only\r\nthat Germany would establish and guarantee the independence of Ireland,\r\nbut that she would help Ireland to develop her industries and commerce,\r\nher resources in coal, metals and peat, which still after a hundred years\r\nof the Union were no further developed than they had been in the middle of\r\nthe eighteenth century. To most Irishmen the panegyric of German\r\ndisinterestedness was an idle tale, and Sinn Fein had been proclaiming\r\n(not without success) for nearly a score of years that the development of\r\nIreland must not be expected from outsiders but from Irishmen themselves.\r\nBut there were those who thought that the power to raise the heavy hand of\r\nEngland must be found, not in the slow efforts of a painful and hampered\r\nself-reliance, but in a hand heavier still: and it was assumed that German\r\naid once given to free and re-establish Ireland would be withdrawn before\r\nit became tutelage and exploitation. No one dreamed of an Ireland that\r\nshould exchange the penurious restraint of the Union for the prosperous\r\nservitude of a German Province: the end of all endeavour was the sovereign\r\nindependence of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe German Foreign Office, with the sanction of the Imperial Chancellor,\r\nhad quite early in the war, on the motion of Roger Casement, given what\r\nwas taken for an unequivocal assurance on this point. \"The Imperial\r\nGovernment,\" the statement ran, \"declares formally that Germany would not\r\ninvade Ireland with any intentions of conquest or of the destruction of\r\nany institutions. If, in the course of this war, which Germany did not\r\nseek, the fortunes of arms should ever bring German troops to the coast of\r\nIreland, they would land there, not as an army of invaders coming to rob\r\nor destroy, but as the fighting forces of a Government inspired by\r\ngoodwill toward a land and a people for whom Germany only wishes national\r\nprosperity and national freedom.\" Even a slight acquaintance with methods\r\nof imperial expansion would point to the necessity for a rigorous scrutiny\r\nof the terms of such a declaration and no such scrutiny would pronounce\r\nthis declaration to be even moderately satisfactory: even if it stood the\r\ntest it would not (so mysterious are the ways of State policy) have been\r\nworth the paper it was written on. But \"cows over the water have long\r\nhorns\"--the German promise was an anchor sure and steadfast.\r\n\r\nWhatever aid might be expected from Germany to secure the success of a\r\nrevolution, nothing could be done without a party in Ireland united in its\r\naims and able to take advantage of any aid that might be sent. No single\r\nparty in Ireland could have been said to fulfil the conditions. The only\r\nNationalist section which could have combined with an outside\r\nexpeditionary force landing in Ireland was the Irish Volunteers, but not\r\none of them was, by virtue of his Volunteer pledge, in any way bound to do\r\nso. Nor was there any guarantee that their views as to the ultimate form\r\nwhich a free Irish constitution should assume were identical: in fact it\r\nwas known that they were not. Official Sinn Fein still found the\r\nindependence of Ireland in the Constitution of 1782: the Republicans would\r\nhave nothing but a \"true Republican Freedom.\" The Citizen Army was\r\nRepublican in its teaching but it was openly hostile to both sections of\r\nthe Volunteers. To it Sinn Fein and many of the Republicans seemed a\r\nbourgeois party, from which the workers need expect nothing. To James\r\nConnolly, their leader, the vaunted prosperity reached under the\r\nindependent Irish Parliament was the prosperity of a class and not of the\r\ncommunity, and he could point to the writings of Arthur O'Connor, ignored\r\nby orthodox Sinn Feiners, in proof of his contention. To establish the\r\npolitical ideals of Sinn Fein the Citizen Army was not prepared to raise\r\nits little finger. The Republicans might have seemed more sympathetic and\r\ncongenial allies; but many even of them seemed too remote and formal in\r\ntheir ideals, too much wrapped up in visions of a future Ireland, free and\r\nindivisible, to have time to spare for the formulation of the means by\r\nwhich all Irishmen might really be free. But there were not wanting men on\r\nboth sides who saw the necessity of union in the face of a common danger\r\nfor the furtherance of a common purpose, who taught that if Labour should\r\npledge itself to Ireland, Ireland should also pledge itself to Labour.\r\nThis union when it came about was mainly due to James Connolly and P. H.\r\nPearse.\r\n\r\nJames Connolly had been for several years the acknowledged leader of Irish\r\nSocialism. His book on _Labour in Irish History_ written in 1910 is\r\nrecognized as a standard work: his _Reconquest of Ireland_, his pamphlet\r\n_The New Evangel_, and his articles in _The Irish Worker_ were widely read\r\nand had great influence among Irish Nationalists who belonged to the\r\nLabour movement. His attitude to the two main Irish parties was one of\r\nhostility: he was hostile to the Unionists as representing the party of\r\ntyranny and privilege, to the Home Rulers as the followers of a policy\r\nwhich was \"but a cloak for the designs of the middle-class desirous of\r\nmaking terms with the Imperial Government it pretends to dislike.\" To\r\nardent and vague talk about \"Ireland\" and \"freedom\" he opposed the cool\r\nand critical temper of one who was accustomed to look stern facts in the\r\nface: \"Ireland as distinct from her people,\" he wrote, \"is nothing to me;\r\nand the man who is bubbling over with love and enthusiasm for 'Ireland,'\r\nand can yet pass unmoved through our streets and witness all the wrong and\r\nthe suffering, the shame and the degradation brought upon the people of\r\nIreland--aye, brought by Irishmen upon Irish men and women--without\r\nburning to end it, is in my opinion a fraud and a liar in his heart, no\r\nmatter how he loves that combination of chemical elements he is pleased to\r\ncall 'Ireland'.\" Connolly believed in Irish Nationality, but he would not\r\nhave been satisfied with the right to wear the badges of independence; a\r\nnational flag, a national parliament, a national culture were in\r\nthemselves nothing; but if they meant the right of the common men and\r\nwomen of Ireland to control their own lives and their own destinies then\r\nthey meant everything in the world to him. Like Wolfe Tone he believed in\r\n\"that numerous and respectable class, the men of no property\"; to secure\r\ntheir rights in Ireland he was ready for anything. The national mould in\r\nwhich his Socialism came to be cast did not always appeal to his followers\r\nand associates: they regretted his increasing devotion to Irish\r\nNationalism and his apparent indifference to pure Socialism; as one said\r\nlater, \"The high creed of Irish Nationalism became his daily rosary, while\r\nthe higher creed of international humanity that had so long bubbled from\r\nhis eloquent lips was silent for ever.\" As a matter of fact he tested\r\nalike theoretical Nationalism and theoretical Socialism by the facts;\r\nNationalism, to be worth anything, must secure the rights of the common\r\nmen and women who make up the bulk of the nation: Socialism, to be worth\r\nanything, must secure the rights not of \"humanity\" but of the human beings\r\nwhich compose it, and the principal human beings whose destiny an Irish\r\nSocialist could influence were the Irish. Connolly had never shared the\r\nextreme hostility to the Irish Volunteers which was characteristic of the\r\nbulk of the Citizen Army: while he championed the rights of his class he\r\nrecognized that they formed, along with others, an Irish nation and that\r\ntheir surest charter of freedom would be the charter of freedom of their\r\ncountry. But it must be a real, universal and effective freedom if it were\r\nto be worth the winning. Under his guidance and influence the ideals of\r\nthe Citizen Army began to approximate more closely to those of the Irish\r\nVolunteers.\r\n\r\nThe Irish Volunteers on the other hand were learning under other guidance\r\nto examine more closely the implications of the phrase \"the independence\r\nof Ireland.\" Their guide was P. H. Pearse, a man of great gifts, a high\r\nand austere spirit filled with a great purpose. Through all his work, both\r\nin English and in Irish, plays, poems and stories, runs the thread of an\r\nardent devotion to goodness and beauty, to spiritual freedom, to the faith\r\nthat tries to move mountains and is crushed beneath them. For many years\r\nhis life seems to have been passed in the grave shadow of the sacrifice he\r\nfelt that he was called upon to make for Ireland: he believed that he was\r\nappointed to tread the path that Robert Emmet and Wolfe Tone had trodden\r\nbefore him, and his life was shaped so that it might be worthy of its end.\r\n\r\nTo Pearse the ideal Irishman was Wolfe Tone, and it is significant that\r\none of the first occasions upon which the Irish Volunteers and the Citizen\r\nArmy held a joint demonstration was a pilgrimage to Tone's grave at\r\nBodenstown. It was here that Pearse in 1913 delivered an eloquent and\r\nmemorable address in which he proclaimed his belief that Wolfe Tone was\r\nthe greatest Irishman who had ever lived. \"We have come,\" his speech\r\nbegan, \"to the holiest place in Ireland; holier to us even than the place\r\nwhere Patrick sleeps in Down. Patrick brought us life, but this man died\r\nfor us.\" Pearse saw in Tone the greatest of all Irishmen because he saw\r\nin him the most complete incarnation of the Irish race, of its passion for\r\nfreedom, its gallantry, its essential tolerance: and he urged his hearers\r\nnot to let Tone's work and example perish. Quoting Tone's famous\r\ndeclaration of his objects and his means, of breaking the connection with\r\nEngland by uniting the whole people of Ireland, Pearse concluded: \"I find\r\nhere implicit all the philosophy of Irish Nationalism, all the teaching of\r\nthe Gaelic League, and the later prophets. Ireland one and Ireland\r\nfree--is not this the definition of Ireland a Nation? To that definition\r\nand to that programme we declare our adhesion anew; pledging ourselves as\r\nTone pledged himself--and in this sacred place, by this graveside, let us\r\nnot pledge ourselves unless we mean to keep our pledge--we pledge\r\nourselves to follow in the steps of Tone, never to rest, either by day or\r\nby night, until his work be accomplished, deeming it to be the proudest of\r\nall privileges to fight for freedom, to fight not in despondency but in\r\ngreat joy, hoping for the victory in our day, but fighting on whether\r\nvictory seem near or far, never lowering our ideal, never bartering one\r\njot or tittle of our birthright, holding faith to the memory and the\r\ninspiration of Tone, and accounting ourselves base as long as we endure\r\nthe evil thing against which he testified with his blood.\"\r\n\r\nTo show that Wolfe Tone was a revolutionary, that he aimed at the complete\r\noverthrow of English ascendancy in Ireland and at the severing of all\r\npolitical connection between the two countries, that he believed in an\r\nIreland in which the designations of Catholic and Protestant should be\r\nswallowed up in the common bonds of nationhood--all this needed no\r\nproving, for it was matter of common knowledge with all to whom Tone's\r\nname was known. But it was necessary to do more than this. Pearse had to\r\nshow in the first place that Tone might be taken as the normal and\r\nclassical representative of the Irish national ideal, and in the second\r\nplace that he was no mere ordinary constitution-monger but a teacher of a\r\nphilosophy of nationality, valid not for his own age only, but always,\r\ncapable of furnishing guidance in the just and orderly upbuilding of a\r\nmodern community, of satisfying at once the claims of the nation and the\r\nclaims of its humblest member. To this task he gave the last months of his\r\nlife: the last four \"Tracts for the Times\" were from his pen: the first\r\nwas written at the end of 1915, the last in March, 1916, a fortnight\r\nbefore the Rising. The first of these four pamphlets was entitled\r\n\"Ghosts,\" a title borrowed from Ibsen. It is an exposition of the national\r\nteaching of five Irish leaders, Wolfe Tone, Thomas Davis, James Fintan\r\nLalor, John Mitchel and Charles Stewart Parnell, all of whom held and\r\ntaught that the national claim of Ireland was for independence and\r\nseparation; their ghosts haunt the generation which has disowned them,\r\nthey will not be appeased till their authority is again acknowledged. A\r\nfew sentences will make the thesis of this tract (and to some extent of\r\nthe following tracts) clear. \"There has been nothing more terrible in\r\nIrish history than the failure of the last generation. Other generations\r\nhave failed in Ireland, but they have failed nobly; or, failing ignobly,\r\nsome man among them has redeemed them from infamy by the splendour of his\r\nprotest. But the failure of the last generation has been mean and\r\nshameful, and no man has arisen from it to do a splendid thing in virtue\r\nof which it shall be forgiven. The whole episode is squalid. It will\r\nremain the one sickening chapter in a story which, gallant or sorrowful,\r\nhas everywhere else some exaltation of pride.... Even had the men\r\nthemselves been less base, their failure would have been inevitable. When\r\none thinks over the matter for a little one sees that they have built upon\r\nan untruth. They have conceived of nationality as a material thing whereas\r\nit is a spiritual thing.... Hence, the nation to them is not all holy, a\r\nthing inviolate and inviolable, a thing that a man dare not sell or\r\ndishonour on pain of eternal perdition. They have thought of nationality\r\nas a thing to be negotiated about as men negotiate about a tariff or about\r\na trade route.... I make the contention that the national demand of\r\nIreland is fixed and determined; that that demand has been made by every\r\ngeneration; that we of this generation receive it as a trust from our\r\nfathers; that we are bound by it; that we have not the right to alter it\r\nor to abate it by one jot or tittle; and that any undertaking made in the\r\nname of Ireland to accept in full satisfaction of Ireland's claim\r\nanything less than the generations of Ireland have stood for is null and\r\nvoid.... The man who in the name of Ireland accepts as a \"final\r\nsettlement\" anything less by one fraction of an iota than separation from\r\nEngland will be repudiated by the new generation as surely as O'Connell\r\nwas repudiated by the generation that came after him. The man who in\r\nreturn for the promise of a thing which is not merely less than separation\r\nbut which denies separation and declares the Union perpetual, the man who\r\nin return for this declares peace between England and Ireland and\r\nsacrifices to England as a peace-holocaust the blood of 50,000 Irishmen is\r\nguilty of so immense an infidelity, so immense a crime against the Irish\r\nnation, that one can only say of him that it were better for that man (as\r\nit were certainly better for his country) that he had not been born.\" The\r\npamphlet concludes with a historic retrospect of the Irish struggle for\r\nindependence till the end of the seventeenth century, of the Anglo-Irish\r\nclaim for independence in the eighteenth century, and with quotations from\r\nthe five great Irish leaders since the last decade of that century joining\r\nin the same claim.\r\n\r\nThe next tract, \"The Separatist Idea,\" was a detailed study of Wolfe\r\nTone's political teaching. Tone was not merely a \"heroic soul,\" he\r\npossessed an \"austere and piercing intellect,\" which, \"dominating Irish\r\npolitical thought for over a century,\" had given Ireland \"its political\r\ndefinitions and values.\" Tone had written in his _Autobiography_, \"I made\r\nspeedily [in 1790] what was to me a great discovery, though I might have\r\nfound it in Swift or Molyneux, that the influence of England was the\r\nradical vice of our Government, and that consequently Ireland would never\r\nbe either free, prosperous or happy until she was independent and that\r\nindependence was unattainable whilst the connection with England existed.\"\r\nIn a pamphlet called \"An Argument on behalf of the Catholics of Ireland\"\r\nTone (signing himself \"A Northern Whig\") had tried to convince the\r\nDissenters \"that they and the Catholics had but one common interest and\r\none common enemy: that the depression and slavery of Ireland was produced\r\nand perpetuated by the divisions existing between them, and that,\r\nconsequently, to assert the independence of their country, and their own\r\nindividual liberties, it was necessary to forget all former feuds, to\r\nconsolidate the entire strength of the whole nation and to form for the\r\nfuture but one people.\" In his earlier years Tone had not been a\r\nRepublican, but Republicanism was the creed which he finally professed. He\r\ndefined the aim of an Irish Constitution as the promotion of \"The Rights\r\nof Man in Ireland.\" To secure this end reliance must be had not on a\r\nsection of the nation but on the nation as a whole. \"If the men of\r\nproperty will not support us,\" he said, \"they must fall: we can support\r\nourselves by the aid of that numerous and respectable class of the\r\ncommunity--the men of no property.\" \"In this glorious appeal to Caesar,\"\r\ncomments Pearse, \"modern Irish democracy has its origin.\" Tone then was\r\nnot merely a Republican and a Separatist but a Democrat prepared for a\r\ndemocratic and revolutionary policy.\r\n\r\nIn his next tract \"The Spiritual Nation\" Pearse analyzed the national\r\nteaching of Thomas Davis, who was to him the embodiment of the idea of the\r\nspiritual side of nationality. Davis was a Separatist (Pearse puts this,\r\nby quotation from his writings, beyond reasonable doubt) but he laid\r\nstress more upon the spiritual than upon the material side of Irish\r\nindependence. He saw in nationality \"the sum of the facts, spiritual and\r\nintellectual, which mark off one nation from another,\" the language, the\r\nfolklore, the literature, the music, the art, the social customs. \"The\r\ninsistence on the spiritual fact of nationality is Davis's distinctive\r\ncontribution to political thought in Ireland, but it is not the whole of\r\nDavis.\" To secure spiritual independence, material freedom is necessary,\r\nand such freedom can only be found in political independence. One\r\nrhetorical paragraph of Davis's makes his attitude clear. \"Now,\r\nEnglishmen, listen to us. Though you were to-morrow to give us the best\r\ntenures on earth--though you were to equalise Presbyterian, Catholic and\r\nEpiscopalian--though you were to give us the amplest representation in\r\nyour Senate--though you were to restore our absentees, disencumber us of\r\nyour debt, and redress every one of our fiscal wrongs--and though, in\r\naddition to all this, you plundered the treasuries of the world to lay\r\ngold at our feet and exhausted the resources of your genius to do us\r\nworship and honour--still we tell you--we tell you in the name of liberty\r\nand country--we tell you in the name of enthusiastic hearts, thoughtful\r\nsouls and fearless spirits--we tell you by the past, the present and the\r\nfuture, we would spurn your gifts if the condition were that Ireland\r\nshould remain a province. We tell you and all whom it may concern, come\r\nwhat may--bribery or deceit, justice, policy or war--we tell you, in the\r\nname of Ireland, that Ireland shall be a nation.\"\r\n\r\nIn the last pamphlet, \"The Sovereign People,\" Pearse essayed the hardest\r\ntask of all. It was introduced by the short preface, dated 31st March,\r\n1916, \"This pamphlet concludes the examination of the Irish definition of\r\nfreedom which I promised in 'Ghosts.' For my part I have no more to say.\"\r\nIt is told that he entreated the printer to have it published at once: he\r\nwished his last words, the final manifesto of his party, to be in the\r\nhands of the public before he went into the Rising. The tract is an\r\nattempt to establish, on the basis of the writings of James Fintan Lalor,\r\nthe thesis that the independence claimed for Ireland is of a republican\r\nand democratic type. He expressed his views clearly and unequivocally upon\r\nsuch questions as the rights of private property, the individual ownership\r\nof the material resources of the community, and universal suffrage.\r\nPearse's views as expressed in this pamphlet are seen to be practically\r\nidentical with those of James Connolly, and there is little doubt that it\r\nwas upon the basis of some such understanding that Pearse's followers and\r\nthose of Connolly joined forces at the last. \"The nation's sovereignty,\"\r\nthe exposition runs, \"extends not only to all the men and women of the\r\nnation, but to all the material possessions of the nation, the nation's\r\nsoil and all its resources, all wealth and all wealth-producing processes\r\nwithin the nation. In other words, no private right to property is good as\r\nagainst the public right of the nation. But the nation is under a moral\r\nobligation so to exercise its public right as to secure strictly equal\r\nrights and liberties to every man and woman within the nation.... No class\r\nin the nation has rights inferior to those of any other class. No class in\r\nthe nation is entitled to privileges superior to those of any other\r\nclass.... To insist upon the sovereign control of the nation over all the\r\nproperty within the nation is not to disallow the right to private\r\nproperty. It is for the nation to determine to what extent private\r\nproperty may be held by its members and in what items of the nation's\r\nmaterial resources private property may be allowed. A nation may, for\r\ninstance, determine, as the free Irish nation determined and enforced for\r\nmany centuries, that private ownership shall not exist in land, that the\r\nwhole of a nation's soil is the public property of the nation.... There is\r\nnothing divine or sacrosanct in any of these arrangements; they are\r\nmatters of purely human concern, matters for discussion and adjustment\r\nbetween the members of a nation, matters to be decided on finally by the\r\nnation as a whole; and matters in which the nation as a whole can revise\r\nor reverse its decision whenever it seems good in the common interests to\r\ndo so.... In order that the people may be able to choose as a legislation\r\nand as a government men and women really and fully representative of\r\nthemselves, they will keep the choice actually or virtually in the hands\r\nof the whole people ... they will, if wise, adopt the widest possible\r\nfranchise--give a vote to every adult man and woman of sound mind. To\r\nrestrict the franchise in any respect is to prepare the way for some\r\nfuture usurpation of the rights of the sovereign people. The people, that\r\nis the whole people, must remain sovereign not only in theory but in\r\nfact.... It is in fact true that the repositories of the Irish tradition,\r\nas well the spiritual tradition of nationality as the kindred tradition of\r\nstubborn physical resistance to England, have been the great, faithful,\r\nsplendid, common people, that dumb multitudinous throng which sorrowed\r\nduring the penal night, which bled in '98, which starved in the Famine;\r\nand which is here still--what is left of it--unbought and unterrified. Let\r\nno man be mistaken as to who will be lord in Ireland, when Ireland is\r\nfree. The people will be lord and master.\" These theses are enforced by\r\nquotations from Lalor, the most outspoken Democrat and Radical in the\r\ntradition of Irish nationalism. The pamphlet concludes with a defence of\r\nJohn Mitchel (who adopted Lalor's teaching) against the charge of hating\r\nthe English people. \"Mitchel, the least apologetic of men, was at pains to\r\nexplain that his hate was not of English men and women, but of the English\r\nthing which called itself a government in Ireland, of the English Empire,\r\nof English commercialism supported by English militarism, a thing wholly\r\nevil, perhaps the most evil thing that there has ever been in the world.\"\r\n\r\nOn Palm Sunday, 1916, the Union of Irish Labour and Irish Nationality was\r\nproclaimed in a striking fashion. In the evening of that day Connolly\r\nhoisted over Liberty Hall, the headquarters of the Citizen Army, the Irish\r\ntricolour of orange, white and green, the flag designed by the Young\r\nIrelanders in 1848 to symbolise the union of the Orange and Green by the\r\nwhite bond of a common brotherhood. On Easter Monday the Irish Republic\r\nwas proclaimed in arms in Dublin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER THE RISING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are many interesting topics of enquiry in connection with the Easter\r\nRising: but they relate to points of detail or affect the responsibility\r\nof individuals; they do not concern the history of Sinn Fein. The Rising\r\nwas the work not of Sinn Fein, but of the leaders of the Republican Party\r\nin the Irish Volunteers and of the Citizen Army. Of the signatories to the\r\nproclamation of the Republic only one had any sort of connection with Sinn\r\nFein and he had been a reforming, rather than an orthodox, Sinn Feiner.\r\nBut the general public, some from mere instinct, others from a desire to\r\ndiscredit a movement which they disliked and feared, persisted in calling\r\nthe Rising by the name of the \"Sinn Fein Rebellion,\" and substituted \"Sinn\r\nFein\" for \"Irish\" in speaking of the Volunteers. In truth it would have\r\nbeen impossible for Sinn Fein, even if it had wished to do so, to\r\nrepudiate all responsibility for the Rising. It had from the beginning\r\nproclaimed the independence of Ireland, not (it is true) in the form of an\r\nIrish Republic, but in the form of a National Constitution free from any\r\nsubordination to the Parliament of England: it had renounced the idea of\r\nan appeal to arms in view of the certain failure of an armed rising: but\r\nit had not repudiated revolution upon principle and it had admitted that\r\nin certain contingencies Ireland might with propriety appeal to arms to\r\nsecure its independence. The only criticism it could make upon the Rising\r\nwould have been that it was a well-intentioned error of judgment, the\r\nerror of men who had mistaken their means and their opportunity for\r\naccomplishing an object good in itself. It is highly improbable that any\r\nsuch criticism would under the circumstances have been made in public by\r\nthe leaders of Sinn Fein: in any case they were not afforded the\r\nopportunity to make it, for they were arrested and deported as part of the\r\nmeasures of repression taken after the Rising had collapsed.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Rising Ireland was still far from being either Sinn\r\nFein or Republican. The prestige of parliamentarianism had been shaken and\r\nits strength impaired: expectations had been disappointed, but the reasons\r\nfor the failure were still the subject of keen discussion, and the Sinn\r\nFein explanation was by no means universally accepted. Convinced\r\nRepublicans were a minority, insignificant except for their ability and\r\nfervour. The mass of Nationalists felt disturbed and uneasy. It was plain\r\nthat their cause was losing ground, and that mere pre-occupation with the\r\nwar was not the sole reason for the growing indifference of England to the\r\ngovernment of Ireland. Nationalist Ireland was represented (by people who\r\naffected to speak more in sorrow than in anger) as having disowned the\r\npatriotic lead of Mr. Redmond and as failing in its duty, and this view\r\nwas clearly becoming the prevalent view in England. The policy pursued by\r\nthe War Office towards Nationalist recruits (a policy described by a\r\nmember of the War Cabinet as \"malignant\") was slowly killing recruiting,\r\nand the decline of recruiting was claimed to be a justification of the\r\npolicy that produced it, and that by people perfectly well aware of the\r\nfacts. The favour shown to the Ulster Volunteers had not induced them to\r\ngo in a body to the war: but while they were reported to have done\r\nmagnificently, the National Volunteers were held to have done little and\r\nto have done it with a bad grace. The advent of the Coalition Government,\r\nwhich included some of the bitterest enemies of Irish Nationalism, did not\r\nmend matters. Mr. Redmond, it is true, was offered a seat in the Coalition\r\nCabinet and declined the offer. It seemed to many Irishmen at the time\r\nthat Mr. Redmond might very well have accepted it: that having stretched a\r\npoint in promising Irish assistance in the war out of gratitude for a\r\ncoming recognition of Irish claims, it was a mere standing upon ceremony\r\nto refuse to stretch another point and enter an English Ministry. But Mr.\r\nRedmond decided in view of the state of feeling in Ireland that he had\r\ngone as far as was prudent. His generous enthusiasm had received a shock,\r\nfirst in the hints of Irish disapproval at his failure to take full\r\nadvantage of his opportunity, secondly when he came into contact with the\r\ncold hostility of the War Office. His slowly waning influence in Ireland\r\nmight have vanished if he had advanced farther on the path of\r\nunconditional co-operation. It had been for years a maxim--the maxim--of\r\nthe Nationalist Party to accept no office under the Union Constitution,\r\nand no office under the Crown until the claims of Ireland had been\r\nconceded. These claims had not been conceded, and the prospect that they\r\nwould ever be conceded was growing fainter. Had he represented Ireland\r\nunder an Irish Constitution, even a Provisional Constitution, the case\r\nwould have been different: Nationalist Ireland would have followed him, as\r\nEngland then followed Mr. Asquith: but to enter the Cabinet under the\r\ncircumstances as the representative of Ireland seemed to be merely to\r\nforfeit by his entry the only ground upon which he had a claim to enter\r\nit. His decision left the way open to the almost unfettered activities of\r\nthe opponents of his policy both in England and in Ireland. The strength\r\nof England in time of war, the readiness of her public men to subordinate,\r\nwithin limits, the strife of parties to the interests of the Commonwealth,\r\nmeant the weakness of Ireland in the end. It was loudly proclaimed in\r\nEngland that the happy co-operation of days of stress must not be allowed\r\nto be broken up when peace dawned: that the strife of parties must be\r\nmitigated when war was over: but Ireland knew that she had been in later\r\nyears their chief battleground, and that any mitigation of their quarrel,\r\nwhile it might be to the advantage of English public life, could only be\r\nbrought about at the expense of her national hopes. And in Ireland the\r\nExecutive, pursuing a fixed anti-national policy, tempered only by the\r\nprudence, the theoretical liberalism, or the bland indifference of\r\nsuccessive Chief Secretaries, could henceforth count on the steady backing\r\nof friends in power over the water.\r\n\r\nThe Rising came like a flash of lightning in an evening twilight,\r\nilluminating and terrifying. It was not entirely unexpected: those whose\r\nduty and those whose pleasure it is to suspect everything had been uneasy\r\nfor some time. The few people who were in touch with the inner circles of\r\nthe Irish Volunteers had long known that something was in progress. But\r\nthe authorities had nothing definite to go upon, and the majority of\r\nIrishmen knew nothing definite about it. When news came that Dublin had\r\nbeen seized, that an Irish Republic had been proclaimed, and that troops\r\nwere hurrying across from England, the prevailing feeling was one of\r\nstupefaction. Even the Unionist newspapers, never at a loss before in\r\npointing the Irish moral, were stunned for the moment. When the facts\r\nbegan to be realized, Unionist and Nationalist joined in a common\r\ncondemnation of the Rising, which, unable to accomplish its professed aim,\r\ncould have no real effect beyond that of hampering the Allied cause. Later\r\non Nationalists began to fear and Unionists to hope that it meant the\r\ndeath of Home Rule, or at least its postponement to an indefinite future.\r\n\r\nWhen the Rising was crushed and the leaders and their followers had\r\nsurrendered it is questionable whether the fortunes of Republicanism in\r\nIreland had ever been at so low an ebb. All their plans had miscarried;\r\ntheir very counsels had been contradictory and confused. German assistance\r\nhad disappointed them; the country had not supported them; and the army\r\nhad made an end of their resistance and had brought their strongholds\r\nabout their heads: their leaders were in custody, not even as prisoners of\r\nwar: all of their followers who had shown that they could be counted on\r\nwere either dead or in gaol. There was no district in Ireland that had not\r\nsent men to the war: many of them had died at the hands of the Germans to\r\nwhom the Republican leaders had looked for aid, many of them were risking\r\ntheir lives every hour; it was not from the friends and neighbours of\r\nthese men that sympathy for the Rising could have been expected. Sinn Fein\r\nwas involved in the general feeling; if it had not fomented the Rising,\r\nwhat had it done to discourage it? Was it not the stimulus which had\r\nspurred more daring spirits into action?\r\n\r\nA bruised reed never seemed less difficult to break or less worth the\r\nbreaking. It was decided to break it _ad majorem cautelam_.\r\n\r\nFour days after the surrender Pearse and two others after a secret trial\r\nwere shot in the morning: the next day and the next others were shot.\r\nThere was a pause of three days, and the shooting was resumed till\r\nthirteen had paid the penalty. After the thirteenth execution, a\r\nproclamation was issued that the General Officer Commanding in Chief had\r\n\"found it imperative\" to inflict these punishments, which it was hoped\r\nwould act as a deterrent and show that such proceedings as those of the\r\nRising could not be tolerated. Two more executions followed, that of James\r\nConnolly and another. At the same time arrests took place all over the\r\ncountry. Three thousand prisoners who had taken no part in the Rising were\r\ncollected, many of them as innocent of any complicity in the affair as the\r\nPrime Minister. To have been at any time a member of the Irish Volunteers\r\nwas sufficient cause for arrest and deportation. They were taken through\r\nthe streets in lorries and in furniture vans at the dead of night and\r\nshipped for unknown destinations.\r\n\r\nIn a normally governed country, a strong Government enjoying the support\r\nof the community has a comparatively easy task in dealing with an\r\nunsuccessful rebellion, if a rebellion should occur. It can shoot the\r\nleaders, if it thinks them worth shooting, or do practically what it\r\npleases with them, and gain nothing but credit for its firmness or\r\nclemency (as the case may be). But in a country not normally governed (and\r\nno one either inside or outside Ireland considered the Irish government to\r\nbe normal) the matter is more intricate. If the Government is united, has\r\nclean hands and unlimited force, and is prepared to employ force\r\nindefinitely, it may do as it pleases: but few Governments are in this\r\nposition and those which are not have to pick their steps. In the case of\r\nthe Easter Rising the Government began by going forward with great\r\nconfidence beyond the point whence retreat was possible and then\r\ndetermined very carefully to pick its steps back again. At first it acted\r\n\"with vigour and firmness\": it handed the situation over to the care of a\r\ncompetent and tried officer, who proceeded to treat it as a mere matter of\r\ndepartmental routine. He was alert, prompt and businesslike. He did not\r\nhesitate to take what seemed \"necessary steps\" or to speak out where\r\nspeaking plainly seemed called for. He let it be known that he had come to\r\nact and he did what he had come for.\r\n\r\nDuring the week of the executions an almost unbroken silence reigned in\r\nIreland. The first hint that anything was wrong came on the cables from\r\nAmerica. The men who were shot in Dublin had been accorded a public\r\nfuneral in New York. Empty hearses followed by a throng of mourners had\r\npassed through streets crowded with sympathisers standing with bared\r\nheads. Anxious messages from British agents warned the Government that a\r\ndemonstration like this could not be disregarded. The executions were\r\nover, but the Prime Minister decided to go to Ireland to enquire into the\r\nsituation on the spot. When he landed the tide of Irish feeling had\r\nalready turned.\r\n\r\nThe catastrophic change of feeling in Ireland is not difficult to explain.\r\nThe Rising had occurred suddenly and had ended in a sudden and hopeless\r\nfailure. The leaders and their followers had surrendered, and the\r\nauthorities held them at their absolute disposal. The utter hopelessness\r\nof any attempt to establish a Republic, or effect any other change in the\r\ngovernment of Ireland by armed force, especially at such a time, had been\r\nclearly demonstrated. England held Ireland in the hollow of its hand.\r\nAfter four days' cool deliberation it was decided to shoot the leaders.\r\nThey were not brought to open trial on the charge of high treason or on\r\nany other charge: the authorities who carried out the sentence were those\r\nwho passed judgment upon their guilt and the only people who ever heard or\r\nsaw the evidence upon which the judgment was based. They were shot in\r\nbatches: for days the lesson was hammered home in stroke after stroke that\r\nthese men were entitled neither to open trial and proof of their guilt\r\nbefore execution, nor to the treatment of captured enemies. The conclusion\r\ndrawn by Nationalist Ireland was that if they had been Englishmen they\r\nwould have been tried by English courts and sentenced by the judgment of\r\ntheir countrymen: that if they had been Germans or Turks they would have\r\nbeen treated as prisoners of war: but that being Irishmen they were in a\r\nclass apart, members of a subject race, the mere property of a\r\ncourtmartial. The applause of Parliament when the Prime Minister announced\r\nthe executions was taken to represent the official sanction of the English\r\npeople and their agreement with this attitude towards Ireland. It was\r\nresented in Ireland with a fierce and sudden passion: a tongue of flame\r\nseemed to devour the work of long years in a single night. After the\r\nexecution of Pearse it would have been vain to argue against him that he\r\nhad appealed to Germany for aid and invited to Ireland hands red with the\r\nblood of Irish soldiers: the reply would have been that he might have done\r\nso or he might not; that it had never been proved what he did; that he had\r\nacted for the best; that\r\n\r\n  What matters it, if he was Ireland's friend?\r\n  There are but two great parties in the end.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister, less than a month after the Rising, spent a week in\r\nIreland prosecuting enquiries: they resulted in two conclusions, one that\r\n\"the existing machinery of Irish government\" had broken down, the other\r\nthat a unique opportunity had offered itself for a settlement.\r\nNegotiations for the desired settlement were, on the Prime Minister's\r\ninvitation, begun by Mr. Lloyd George. He contented himself with taking up\r\nthe first settlement that came to hand, the old proposal for partition;\r\nbut during the negotiations he left the idea in the mind of the\r\nNationalist leader that the partition proposed was only temporary and in\r\nthe mind of the Unionist leader that it was to be permanent. Each asserted\r\nthat Mr. Lloyd George had been explicit in his statement, and the\r\nunexplained discrepancy wrecked the negotiations. Even had they succeeded\r\nbetween the parties principally concerned, they would never have led to\r\nanything; for the Unionist members of the Coalition when there seemed to\r\nbe a risk of agreement, declared that they would have no settlement at\r\nall. The Prime Minister and his deputy yielded and reconstituted \"the\r\nexisting machinery of Irish government\" by reappointing the former Viceroy\r\nand replacing the Liberal Chief Secretary by a Unionist. Apparently their\r\nchief object was not so much to make the Government in Ireland acceptable\r\nto Irishmen as to make it less objectionable to Unionists. The result in\r\nIreland was what might have been foreseen. Any idea there may have been\r\nthat the English Government was really desirous of establishing peace and\r\njustice in Ireland vanished like smoke. Mr. Redmond warned the Government\r\nof the consequences of their \"inaction\" (if any policy which was steadily\r\nproducing the most profound revulsion in Irish feeling could be described\r\nby that word) but the Government was obdurate. It refused to release the\r\ninterned suspects, it refused to treat them as political prisoners, it\r\nrefused to mitigate the application of martial law: and gave as its reason\r\nthe fact that the state of the country still \"gave cause for anxiety.\" The\r\nonly party that had no cause for \"anxiety\" as to its future was Sinn Fein.\r\n\r\nThe resentment at the execution of the leaders of the Rising had not\r\nconfined itself to the indulgence of feelings of rage and sorrow. It had\r\nled to an eager inquiry into what it was that had caused these men to do\r\nwhat they did. People who had hardly heard of Sinn Fein before wanted to\r\nknow precisely what it was and what it taught: people who had not known\r\nPearse and Connolly when they were alive were full of curiosity about\r\nthem, their principles and their writings. Much of this curiosity was\r\nmorbid and led nowhere: but a great deal of it led large numbers of people\r\nvery far indeed. Sinn Fein pamphlets began to be in demand: a month after\r\nthe Rising it was hardly possible to procure a single one of them. But if\r\nthey could not be bought, thumbed and tattered copies were passed from\r\nhand to hand: their teachings and the doctrines of Sinn Fein were\r\ndiscussed all over Ireland. The (to many) surprising fact became known\r\nthat the Rising was not an attempt to help Germany or to put Ireland into\r\nGerman possession, but to free Ireland from all foreign influence: that\r\nthe leaders proclaimed themselves followers of Tone and Mitchel and Davis\r\nand Parnell, that they claimed that Irish Nationalism meant according to\r\nthese exponents (and no man in Ireland ventured to question their\r\nauthority) Irish independence, nothing less and nothing more. The instinct\r\nfor freedom, the feeling that the existing Government of Ireland had not\r\nfor a hundred years fulfilled the primary functions of government, became\r\na reasoned and rooted conviction that something more was needed to mend it\r\nthan mere Home Rule. The price that Ireland had been asked to pay for Home\r\nRule, that it was still pertinaciously pressed to agree to, the partition\r\nof Ireland, seemed an unforgivable treachery beside the fair prospect of\r\nan Ireland one and indivisible, in which Orange and Green, Protestant and\r\nCatholic were united in the love and service of a common country. The\r\npolicies of the past, barren as they now seemed of content and substance,\r\nwere abandoned for the new promise of a commonwealth in which all Irishmen\r\nshould be equal, in which the worker saw a prospect of a better and a\r\nfuller life than without it he could hope to have. This had been the ideal\r\nof the Rising; but it was the bitter truth that the Rising had not brought\r\nit any nearer, and that no Rising seemed likely to be any more successful.\r\nSinn Fein with its policy of self-reliance, of refusing to recognize what\r\nit hoped by so doing to bring to nothing, of distrust of all policies of\r\nreaching freedom by an acknowledgment of subjection offered the means of\r\nrealizing what the Rising had failed to bring nearer. But Sinn Fein could\r\nnot be accepted as it stood: offering the Constitution of 1782 it had\r\nfailed to carry with it more than a few doctrinaire enthusiasts: agreeing\r\nto the constitution which the leaders of the Rising died for it might (and\r\ndid) carry the country with it.\r\n\r\nAll this was going on under the operation of martial law. Members of\r\nParliament did not know it: the Competent Military Authority had no\r\nsuspicion of it. It was believed that all that was required to \"appease\"\r\nthe country, to restore confidence in the Government, to bring back the\r\nhappy days when Ireland was \"the one bright spot\" was to release the\r\nprisoners and resume negotiations for a \"settlement.\" In December, 1916,\r\nthe Asquith Ministry fell. According to its successors it had carried the\r\nart of doing nothing to its highest perfection: they were going to do\r\neverything at once. The new Prime Minister made vague promises of an\r\nattempt to settle the Irish question in the immediate future, and finally\r\non Christmas Eve all the interned prisoners except those undergoing penal\r\nservitude, were sent back to Ireland. They were received with an\r\nenthusiasm which must have proved disquieting to the believers in\r\ncompromise and negotiation.\r\n\r\nEverything began again precisely where it had left off. The prisoners had\r\nbeen requested to give a pledge that, if released, they would cease to\r\nengage in political propaganda objectionable to the Government. This they\r\nhad stoutly refused to do, and they had been released at last without\r\nconditions. Apparently it was supposed that the operation of martial law\r\nand the promises of the new Government would exercise a moderating\r\ninfluence: but martial law was only a standing challenge, and the\r\nsincerity of the Government was no longer believed in. If it had been even\r\nmoderately sincere it might have rallied to the side of compromise those\r\nlarge numbers of men who in every country have an instinctive dread of new\r\nand untried policies and leaders. But it was soon plain that a Prime\r\nMinister pledged to everybody was pledged to nobody.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of February, 1917, the Sinn Fein leaders were at work again.\r\n_Nationality_ reappeared as a weekly paper. It appealed no longer to a few\r\nenthusiasts but to a wide public eager to learn more of the only movement\r\nwhich promised anything definite. Before the Rising Sinn Fein had seemed\r\nto aim at the impossible by means beyond the powers of average human\r\nnature: it did not seem possible that any large body of Irishmen should\r\ntry to secure independence by the hard path of Sinn Fein, when there was a\r\nprospect of something (to all outward appearance) nearly as good to be\r\ngained by recording a vote for the right man at elections. It was now\r\nplain to the average Nationalist that the parliamentary prospect held no\r\npromise: that the Irish Parliamentary Party were no longer listened to,\r\nand that the sworn enemies of Irish nationality were in the seats of power\r\nboth in Ireland and in England. Mr. Redmond, confronted alternately in\r\nEngland by the iron insolence of the Tories and the smiling sinuosities of\r\nthe Prime Minister, manned his guns to the last: but he had no longer the\r\nsupport of the country. The country was beginning to rally to the party\r\nwhich alone seemed to be the party of fixed principles: which had another\r\nstandard by which to measure national rights than the temporary\r\npossibilities, varying from month to month, offered by the difficulties\r\nconfronting English Ministers: the party which did not entreat but\r\ndemanded. Sinn Fein did not promise now any more than in the days of its\r\nobscurity that national freedom could be won by the anaemic struggles of\r\nthe division lobbies in the House: it warned its followers that the way\r\nwould be long and steep, that to shun the steep places was to miss the\r\ntrack, and that the path did not cross the water. It had said this before,\r\nbut it said it now to ears ready to receive it. If men had died for\r\nIreland (men asked) facing the old enemy, what lesser sacrifice could be\r\ncalled too great? A wave of enthusiasm which no appeal to policy or\r\nprudence could withstand swept over the country when the new campaign\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\n_Nationality_ with a tenacity of purpose that nothing seemed able to\r\ndisturb began its new series with the old lesson, the decay of Ireland\r\nunder the Union. As if there had been no Rising, no imprisonments, no\r\nthreats of summary repression, the doctrine was again proclaimed with\r\ndeadly deliberation that the Union had destroyed and was destroying the\r\nprosperity of Ireland even in those districts which clung to it with most\r\naffection. The population of Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down was steadily\r\ndeclining under a system which the inhabitants declared essential to their\r\ncontinued existence. It asserted the right of Ireland to prevent food\r\nbeing exported from the country to feed strangers while the country that\r\nsupplied it was left to starve, and proposed the formation of a Watch\r\nCommittee for every seaport in the country. The very first number\r\ncontained a statement of the policy of an appeal no longer to a Government\r\npledged to disregard it, but to the Peace Conference which must be\r\nsummoned on the conclusion of the war. The advertisement of the Irish\r\nNation League, a body independent of Sinn Fein, already showed how far\r\nSinn Fein principles had spread in Ireland. \"The Irish Nation League\r\nclaims the right of Ireland to recognition as a Sovereign State. It\r\nasserts too and claims Ireland's right to representation at any\r\nInternational Peace Conference. It offers determined and resolute\r\nresistance to any attempt to enforce Conscription.... It calls on the\r\nIrish people to rely on themselves alone.... Members elected under the\r\nauspices of the Irish Nation League will remain under the control of its\r\nSupreme Council and will only act at Westminster when the Council so\r\ndecides. Never again must power be placed in the hands of a parliamentary\r\nparty to mislead the country or to sacrifice opportunities.\" In March\r\n_Nationality_ announced the formation of a National Council to support the\r\nadmission of Ireland to the Peace Conference and \"to safeguard the general\r\ninterests of the nation.\" But though admission to the Peace Conference was\r\nthe political objective of Ireland for the moment it was not regarded as\r\nits ultimate or only aim. The Peace Conference was an opportunity to be\r\nmade use of when circumstances brought it about, a precious and unique\r\nopportunity, but Ireland's main and serious work was to develop her own\r\nresources and her own powers of resistance. Accordingly, though Sinn Fein\r\ndeclared repeatedly its intention of carrying the Irish case before the\r\nPeace Conference, its main work was still to organize and consolidate\r\nopposition to the two chief measures now openly proclaimed as in\r\ncontemplation, the partition of Ireland and the enforcement of\r\nConscription. Both these measures were in contradiction to the claim that\r\n\"the only satisfactory settlement of the Irish Question now is the\r\nindependence of Ireland.\" And it was not hard to show that the professed\r\nobjects of the war were incompatible with the policy of refusing\r\nself-government to Ireland. \"When England declared,\" wrote _Nationality_,\r\n\"that she entered this war with the object of asserting the freedom of\r\nSmall Nations the Lord delivered her into our hands.\"\r\n\r\nThere were not wanting signs that the Sinn Fein policy was rapidly\r\nbecoming the policy of a Nationalist Ireland. By the summer of 1917 at\r\nleast a dozen Irish newspapers were declared exponents of the Sinn Fein\r\npolicy. An election for North Roscommon in February had resulted in the\r\nreturn of the Sinn Fein candidate by an overwhelming majority. The next\r\ncontested election was in May and was by common consent regarded as a test\r\nelection. It was a straight fight between the Parliamentary Party and Sinn\r\nFein. Each party put its full strength into the contest and Sinn Fein won;\r\nthe majority, it is true, was a small one but it was more useful than a\r\nlarge one, for it was both an endorsement and an incentive. The\r\n_Manchester Guardian_ frankly declared that the Sinn Fein victory under\r\nthe circumstances was equivalent to a serious defeat of the British Army\r\nin the field.\r\n\r\nThe reply of the Government to the result of the North Roscommon election\r\nhad been the re-arrest and deportation of some of the released prisoners,\r\nto whom a number of others, some of them prominent Gaelic Leaguers, were\r\nadded; the Chief Secretary defended this action by saying that he had\r\ndecided \"although there can be no charge and although there can be no\r\ntrial\" that it was better for these men to be out of Ireland than to be in\r\nit. The Parliamentary Party, opposed upon principle to Sinn Fein, saw that\r\nmeasures such as these meant its ultimate and complete triumph, but no\r\narguments could move the determination of the Government to rely upon\r\nforce. They seemed to feel that force was the only weapon that was left\r\nthem and that they might as well use it at once; while Sinn Fein could\r\npoint to the employment of it as evidence of its own reiterated but\r\nconstantly challenged contention as to the real attitude of all English\r\nGovernments towards Ireland. And had the Prime Minister and his advisers,\r\nwhoever they may have been, deliberately set themselves to prove to\r\nIreland that they were not the wise representatives of an enlightened and\r\nfriendly democracy (which the Parliamentary Party had up to this\r\nrepresented them to be) but the jealous and implacable guardians of a\r\nsubject and hated race (which Sinn Fein had always asserted that they\r\nwere) it is very doubtful whether they could have bettered their record in\r\na single detail. The Parliamentary Party, fighting for its life, with the\r\nground in Ireland slipping from under its feet, appealed pathetically to\r\nits old services and old friendship, to the memory of the Irishmen who had\r\nfallen in the war, to the opinion of moderate men, to prudence and\r\njustice; it could not deflect by one hair's breadth the course chosen by\r\nthe Cabinet. The fact seems to be that the Tory members who had always\r\nhated the Parliamentary Party saw the chance of paying back old scores and\r\nembraced it regardless of the consequences; while the Liberals, real and\r\nso-called, thought the Parliamentary Party's influence was waning in\r\nIreland, and threw them over without remorse: they had got as much out of\r\nthem as was to be got, and for the rest they might shift for themselves.\r\nIt was very difficult to believe that (as the Prime Minister said) the\r\n\"dominant consideration was the war\" and that preoccupation with it was\r\nthe reason for his refusal to attend to the Irish problem. Everybody knew\r\nthat Ministers, when they were interested, found time for many other\r\nthings than the prosecution of the war. What was done and what was not\r\ndone, and the reasons given both for action and for inaction, only served\r\nto deepen the impression of the insincerity of the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nAlmost simultaneously the Parliamentary Party and Sinn Fein resolved upon\r\nan appeal from the English Ministry and the English Parliament to bodies\r\nthat might be presumed to be less partial. The Irish Party withdrew from\r\nParliament and sent a Manifesto to the United States (now on the verge of\r\nits declaration of war) and the self-governing Dominions. Sinn Fein\r\nsummoned a Convention to meet in Dublin to assert the independence of\r\nIreland, its status as a nation, and its right to representation at the\r\nPeace Conference. This was the first, but it was not to be the only,\r\noccasion upon, which the policy of the Parliamentary Party was moulded,\r\nagainst its will, by the pressure of facts, into a tacit acknowledgment of\r\nthe justice of the Sinn Fein contention, that parliamentary action was\r\nuseless. The only difference was that while Sinn Fein held that it always\r\nwas and always would be useless, English policy being what it always had\r\nbeen, the Parliamentary Party held that the Cabinet had by its action\r\nsince the Rising destroyed the efficacy of the normally useful and\r\nlegitimate means of reform.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this joint appeal from the Cabinet to the impartial opinion\r\nof English-speaking countries and belligerent nations was to induce the\r\nPrime Minister to bring forward \"proposals\" for the settlement of the\r\nquestion. He proposed the exclusion of six counties of Ulster from the\r\nHome Rule Act, if and when it became operative, the exclusion to be\r\nsubject to reconsideration after five years; the immediate establishment\r\nof an Irish Council (in which the excluded counties were to have the same\r\nnumber of delegates as all the rest of Ireland put together) to legislate\r\nfor Ireland during the war; and a reconsideration of the financial clauses\r\nof the Act. Failing the acceptance of this solution, the Prime Minister\r\nsaw nothing for it but to summon a representative body of Irishmen to\r\nsuggest the best means of governing their own country.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister's proposals, whether the product of his own or of some\r\nequally ingenious but equally uninformed brain, were promptly rejected by\r\neverybody: his concluding suggestion was, after some delay, judged worthy\r\nof a trial, the Ulster party stipulating expressly for freedom to refuse\r\nto submit to any findings of the Convention with which it did not choose\r\nto agree. They were practically informed by the Leader of the House of\r\nCommons that their dissent was incompatible with \"the substantial\r\nagreement\" which alone would justify the Government in giving effect to\r\nthe findings of the Convention.\r\n\r\nTo claim that the setting up of the Convention was a sincere attempt to\r\nsolve the problem of Irish Government is to make a demand upon faith which\r\nit might be noble, but would certainly be extremely difficult, to grant.\r\nThe incorporation in the letter by which the Prime Minister suggested it\r\nof an official proposal of heads of a settlement could serve no other\r\npurpose than to indicate that a particular solution had found favour with\r\nthe proposer in advance: and to allow the Ulster Party the right of veto\r\nwas to perpetuate and sanction the attitude which everybody in the Three\r\nKingdoms knew to be the very obstacle which the Convention was blandly\r\ninvited to surmount. It says much for the general desire of Ireland for\r\npeace and settlement that the outcome of the Convention (compassed by\r\nsecrecy which it was declared a criminal offence to violate while it sat)\r\nwas awaited generally with an anxious and almost pathetic expectation.\r\n\r\nSinn Fein promptly refused to take any part in the proceedings. It had\r\nbeen formally invited to do so, but as five places only were assigned to\r\nit, a number far below that to which its actual strength in the country\r\nwas known to entitle it, it was not intended that it should have very much\r\nweight in the conclusions. Besides, the only solution which it was known\r\nto favour, the independence of Ireland, was the only solution which it was\r\nnot possible for the Convention by the terms of its reference to suggest.\r\nIn a leader, declining on behalf of the Sinn Fein Party to participate in\r\nthe proceedings, _Nationality_ said, \"Ignoring the Convention which is\r\ncalled into being only to distract Ireland from the objective now before\r\nher, to confuse her thought, and to permit England to misrepresent her\r\ncharacter and her claims to Europe, Sinn Fein summons Ireland to\r\nconcentrate her mind and energy on preparation for the Peace Conference,\r\nwhere, citing the pledges given to the world by Russia, the United States,\r\nand England's Allies, it will invoke that tribunal to judge between our\r\ncountry and her oppressor and claim that the verdict which has restored\r\nPoland to independent nationhood shall also be registered for Ireland.\"\r\nThe Executive of Sinn Fein also formally and unanimously declined to enter\r\nthe Convention unless (1) the terms of reference left it free to decree\r\nthe complete independence of Ireland; (2) the English Government publicly\r\npledged itself to the United States and the Powers of Europe to ratify the\r\ndecision of the majority of the Convention; (3) the Convention consisted\r\nof none but persons freely elected by adult suffrage in Ireland; (4) the\r\ntreatment of prisoners of war was accorded to Irish political prisoners in\r\nEnglish prisons.\r\n\r\nOf these proposals the first would have been rejected by the Government,\r\nthe second by the Ulster Party, and the third by the Parliamentary Party,\r\nwhich by this time was aware that such a method of choosing\r\nrepresentatives would leave it almost without representation. The\r\nGovernment to \"create an atmosphere\" not merely accepted but improved on\r\nthe fourth condition: the political prisoners were released\r\nunconditionally. It is significant of the way in which \"atmospheres\" are\r\ncreated in Ireland that though the prisoners were released unconditionally\r\non June 17th, a meeting held in Dublin to demand their release, on June\r\n10th, was prohibited by Proclamation, and an attempt to hold it ended in a\r\nriot in which a policeman was killed.\r\n\r\nWhile the Convention was preparing to perform the duties which were to end\r\nin nothing, Sinn Fein was engaged in the task of rallying the country to\r\nits side. The death of Major Willie Redmond had created a vacancy in East\r\nClare: the Parliamentary Party had selected its candidate to succeed him:\r\nbut in little over a month after the release of the prisoners Mr. de\r\nValera, who had been sentenced to penal servitude for his share in the\r\nRising, was elected by an overwhelming majority. The leader \"To the Men of\r\nClare\" in which, the week before the election, _Nationality_ recommended\r\nhim to the electors, was suppressed by the Censor. During the same month\r\nanother vacancy occurred by the death of the member for Kilkenny City, and\r\nas a preliminary to the election the authorities suppressed the _Kilkenny\r\nPeople_, the editor of which was chairman of the convention called to\r\nselect a Sinn Fein candidate, who was promptly returned. Some idea of the\r\nappeals which Sinn Fein was making to the electors may be gathered from\r\nthe leader \"To the Electors, Traders and Taxpayers of Kilkenny,\" in which\r\n_Nationality_ urged the return of its candidate. It began with a quotation\r\nfrom a memorandum addressed in 1799 to Mr. Pitt by Under-Secretary Cooke,\r\n\"The Union is the only means of preventing Ireland from becoming too great\r\nand too powerful,\" and by a quotation from another memorandum to the same\r\nstatesman, \"By giving the Irish a hundred members in an assembly of six\r\nhundred and fifty they will be impotent to operate upon that assembly, but\r\nit will be invested with Irish assent to its authority.\" Figures were\r\ngiven of the value of the trade between Great Britain and a number of\r\ncountries in 1914, the trade with Ireland being nearly as valuable as that\r\nwith the United States, twice that with France and nearly twice that with\r\nGermany. It went on: \"It will be seen that with the exception of the\r\nUnited States, England has no customer nearly as big as Ireland....\r\nEngland has had the market to herself for generations; Sinn Fein proposes\r\nthat England should not continue to monopolise that market longer. Ireland\r\nhas L150,000,000 worth of trade to do with the world each year,\r\nL135,000,000 of which is restricted to England. In return for part of that\r\ntrade the other countries of Europe would gladly give Ireland facilities\r\nin their markets and Ireland would compel England to pay competitive\r\nprices.... So long as Ireland sends members to the English Parliament and\r\nrelies upon that institution, England will plunder Ireland's revenues and\r\nmonopolise Ireland's trade at her own price.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the growing popularity of Sinn Fein was leading to a revival of\r\nthe Irish Volunteers. Drilling was resumed and, though frequent arrests\r\nwere made and the Government declared its intention at all costs of\r\nputting it down, it became more and more popular. Irish Volunteers even\r\ntook possession of the streets of Dublin, in defiance of military orders,\r\nand kept the line of the procession on the occasion of the funeral of\r\nThomas Ashe who had died as the result of forcible feeding and inattention\r\nin Mountjoy Prison. Though Sinn Fein held itself distinct from the\r\nVolunteer Organization it did not refuse to extend some indirect\r\nassistance. It printed a letter of Mr. Devlin's, addressed from the House\r\nof Commons in July, 1916, to a correspondent, which was \"captured\" and\r\nread to a Convention of the National Volunteers in Dublin in August, 1917.\r\nIn the letter Mr. Devlin had discouraged the importation of arms into\r\nIreland for the National Volunteers, some of whom had assisted the troops\r\nin keeping order during the week of the Rising. This was of course\r\nintended to discredit Mr. Devlin in the eyes of the National Volunteers\r\nwhose continued allegiance to the Parliamentary Party was now open to\r\ngrave suspicion. In fact the prospect of their junction with the Irish\r\nVolunteers, a highly significant indication of the trend of opinion,\r\ndecided the Government to disarm them. On the morning of the 15th August\r\nevery place in which the National Volunteers had stored their arms was\r\nraided by the military. The only outcome of this action, combined with the\r\nsteady and obstinate refusal to seize the arms of the Ulster Volunteers\r\n(the only political party in Ireland now left in possession of arms), was\r\nto alienate any sympathy remaining for the Government in the ranks of the\r\nNational Volunteers. Had there been the least pretence of impartiality\r\nshown it might have been otherwise: but to disarm all Nationalists of any\r\nshade of national politics, while designedly and openly leaving the\r\nUnionists armed to the teeth, was a proof, now indeed hardly necessary, of\r\nthe insincerity of official professions. The disarming of all sections of\r\nNationalists gave an excuse for the practice of raiding for arms which now\r\nbecame common and often led to deplorable results. Innocent people were\r\nkilled, either designedly or by accident, and the blame for the murders\r\nwas laid upon the shoulders of Sinn Fein. When a return to the policy of\r\nphysical force seemed threatened some of the ecclesiastical authorities\r\ntook alarm, and issued warnings against breaches of the law of God and\r\nresistance to constituted authority. Murder was of course never\r\ncountenanced by Sinn Fein: but as regards resistance to constituted\r\nauthority, there were two sides to the question and Sinn Fein was not at\r\nall inclined to allow the ecclesiastical authorities to dictate its\r\npolicy. Cardinal Logue might declare that the Sinn Fein programme was\r\ninsane, but it was persisted in without regard to his opinion. Sinn Fein\r\nwas always jealous of ecclesiastical interference: it welcomed gladly the\r\nco-operation of ecclesiastics as Irishmen, but it was determined to keep\r\nits own policy in its own hands.\r\n\r\nWhile the Government Convention was sitting behind closed doors Sinn Fein\r\ndecided to hold a Convention of its own, consisting of delegates freely\r\nelected by Sinn Fein Clubs throughout the country, and to lay its\r\nproceedings and conclusions before the country. The Convention met on\r\nNovember 1 and unanimously elected Mr. de Valera as the President of Sinn\r\nFein, a position which Mr. Griffith had held for six years. The election\r\nwas significant: it meant on the one hand that Sinn Fein thus silently and\r\nwithout any formal repudiation of its previous constitutional attitude\r\naccepted the Republican programme: it meant on the other hand that the\r\nparty of the Rising now publicly and officially accepted the Sinn Fein\r\npolicy and programme as distinct from the policy of armed insurrection.\r\nMr. de Valera had already in a reply to the warnings of the bishops denied\r\nthat another Rising was in contemplation: he had also in a speech at\r\nBailieboro' (28th October, 1917), replied to the kindred charge of\r\npro-Germanism: \"The Sinn Fein Party were said to be pro-Germans, but if\r\nthe Germans came to Ireland to hold it those who are now resisting English\r\npower would be the first to resist the Germans.\" The Constitution adopted\r\nby the Convention sets out at great length the policy and objects of Sinn\r\nFein: its solution of the constitutional problem is as follows: \"Sinn Fein\r\naims at securing the international recognition of Ireland as an\r\nindependent Irish Republic. Having achieved that _status_ the Irish people\r\nmay by referendum freely choose their own form of government. This object\r\nshall be attained through the Sinn Fein Organization which shall in the\r\nname of the sovereign Irish People (a) deny the right and oppose the will\r\nof the British Parliament or British Crown or any other foreign Government\r\nto legislate for Ireland; (b) make use of any and every means available to\r\nrender impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by\r\nmilitary force or otherwise. And whereas no law made without the authority\r\nand consent of the Irish people is, or ever can be, binding on the Irish\r\npeople, therefore in accordance with the resolution of Sinn Fein, adopted\r\nin Convention, 1905, a Constituent Assembly shall be convoked, comprising\r\npersons chosen by the Irish constituencies, as the supreme national\r\nauthority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people and to devise\r\nand formulate measures for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.\" It\r\nwill be noticed that the _status_ of an independent Republic is claimed\r\nnot because Republicanism is the ideal polity, but because such a status\r\nwill leave Ireland free to choose either that or any other form of\r\ngovernment; further that the new movement expressly links itself to the\r\nSinn Fein of pre-war days by a formal recognition of its identity with it\r\nand by the express adoption of its methods; and lastly that the means by\r\nwhich independence is to be achieved are defined as \"any and every means\r\navailable,\" the party being pledged neither to nor against any particular\r\nmethod.\r\n\r\nOne of the methods upon which Sinn Fein now relied to achieve success was\r\nnot the method of its earlier years. This was frankly acknowledged by its\r\nleaders. In an article on the Convention summoned by Count Plunkett to\r\nmeet in the Mansion House in Dublin after his election for North\r\nRoscommon, _New Ireland_ (which was next to _Nationality_ the leading Sinn\r\nFein weekly) wrote as follows: \"In the years 1903--1910 the policy of Sinn\r\nFein was a policy of self-reliance in the strictest sense of that term. It\r\ndirected us away from Westminster and towards Ireland. It was\r\nrevolutionary inasmuch as it sought to displace existing British\r\ninstitutions and substitute Irish institutions to which the Irish people\r\nwould respond.... The newer Sinn Fein is not quite the same as the old: it\r\nvaries in one essential characteristic. Whereas the old Sinn Fein directed\r\nthe Irish people towards self-improvement as a basis of national strength\r\nand made it quite plain to us that many sacrifices might possibly be\r\ndemanded, there is no trace in the newer Sinn Fein of these qualities. The\r\nolder Sinn Fein deprecated the reliance upon any external source of\r\nstrength and urged upon us the advantages of self-reliance and passive\r\nresistance. The new Sinn Fein places some of its faith at least in\r\nexternal bodies and does not inculcate the older doctrine of self-reliance\r\nand passive resistance. It is not, however, Sinn Fein that has changed so\r\nmuch as the world forces that condition such changes. The old policy\r\nflourished in a period of world peace and was in consequence disposed\r\nrather towards a long drawn out struggle: the new policy is specially\r\ndevised to take advantage of the present temporary state of affairs.\" This\r\nmay not be very carefully worded, and it is certain that Sinn Feiners as a\r\nbody would not have accepted it as a complete and accurate statement of\r\nthe change in the Sinn Fein programme: but it is a statement (although a\r\ncareless statement) by a Sinn Fein paper of an important fact--that an\r\nappeal to the Peace Conference was not an exercise of \"self-reliance\" but\r\nthe adoption for the time of a totally different policy. It was in effect\r\nan admission, not that the policy of self-reliance was a failure, but that\r\nit had not yet been a success and was not so likely to be successful in\r\nthe immediate future as an appeal for outside understanding and sympathy.\r\nThe Parliamentarians had appealed to the sympathy and justice of England:\r\nSinn Fein had declared such an appeal to be futile and had refused to\r\njoin in it. It was now prepared to issue its own appeal for help and\r\njustice not to England but to the Peace Conference. Ever since the Rising\r\nthe interaction of the two Nationalist parties upon each other's policy\r\nhad become more and more marked, though they still maintained to one\r\nanother an attitude of hostility and contempt. If Sinn Fein seemed to\r\nchange (at any rate for the time) its policy of strict self-reliance into\r\none of an appeal for outside assistance, the Parliamentary Party had shown\r\na disposition no longer to rely upon appeals to English parties and to the\r\nEnglish Parliament but to call upon a wider audience to judge its cause.\r\nWhile they still differed upon nearly every other point, they were agreed\r\nin this, that to appeal to the Government of 1917 was a waste of time. The\r\nappeal to the Peace Conference was destined to fall upon deaf ears but\r\nthis was not at the time believed to be possible. The Allied statesmen\r\nseemed to be committed beyond any possibility of denial or evasion to \"the\r\nrights of small nations,\" \"government by the consent of the governed\" and\r\nother formulae of national freedom. In reply to cynical suggestions that\r\nthese formulae might possibly be discovered to be (to the regret of their\r\nauthors) inconsistent with the \"realities\" of politics, _New Ireland_\r\nsimply answered: \"We frankly admit that we have faith and hope in the\r\nforce of the great moral principle of justice to the nations and in its\r\nultimate power of bringing back order to the chaos and tragedy of Europe\r\nand of imposing itself upon reactionaries.\"\r\n\r\nBut as a matter of fact, in spite of the energy with which the idea of an\r\nappeal to the Peace Conference was taken up and discussed, in spite even\r\nof such sweeping statements as that quoted above from _New Ireland_, Sinn\r\nFein had at most agreed to graft a new and temporary policy on to the old\r\nstem. It still inculcated self-reliance, the education of the Irish people\r\nin questions of national economics, national finance and national policy:\r\nit still urged the employment of all the means which could be employed by\r\nIrishmen in Ireland to enforce and secure national independence. The\r\ncolumns of _New Ireland_ itself make this perfectly plain; and even in\r\nlater references in that paper to the appeal to the Peace Conference and\r\nthe hopes founded upon it, the editorial language is much less sweeping\r\nthan when the idea was fresh in its fascination. The concentration of\r\nthought upon the Peace Conference was also exercising in another direction\r\na modifying influence upon Sinn Fein. The old idea of the independence of\r\nIreland was being gradually enlarged. It was no longer confined to the\r\npurely negative idea of freedom from foreign control: it assumed the more\r\npositive form of an Ireland entering its place in a great community of\r\nEuropean nations, equally free and mutually dependent, bound to each other\r\nfor the preservation of liberty and civilization. It was hoped that the\r\nappeal to the Peace Conference would result in the recognition of Ireland\r\nnot merely as a nation to which the Conference was bound to see justice\r\ndone, but as a brother and comrade in a new European Confederation for the\r\nadvancement of democratic freedom. In this, Sinn Fein (though the fact is\r\noften obscured) merely represents the form, moulded by special conditions,\r\nwhich an aspiration, common to many of the democracies of Europe, had\r\nassumed in Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1917--18 gave Sinn Fein an opportunity to show that the\r\npolicy of \"self-reliance\" had not been abandoned entirely. During that\r\nwinter the shadow of famine hung over Europe and every nation was engaged\r\nin the effort to avert it from its own shores by rigid conservation and\r\neconomy of its food supply. From Ireland, under the final control of the\r\nEnglish authorities, food continued to be exported recklessly. Cattle,\r\noats and butter were shipped in large quantities to England, though it was\r\nknown that the food supply of Ireland would barely suffice for its own\r\nnecessities till the middle of summer. The independent and Labour members\r\nof the Irish Food Control Committee protested against this: but, being a\r\npurely advisory body and subject to the English Food Controller, the\r\nCommittee found that all their advice was overruled (as one of the members\r\nput it) \"by the man higher up.\" The independent members resigned in\r\ndisgust, leaving the work of the committee to the officials. Sinn Fein\r\nbegan at once to organize an unofficial food census of Ireland: members of\r\nthe Sinn Fein Clubs were invited to put at the disposal of the central\r\norganization their local knowledge of the food supplies of their immediate\r\nneighbourhood. It was the first opportunity on a large scale which the\r\nRepublican organization had to show what its powers and capabilities were\r\nand what body of real support it had in the country. The Chief Council\r\n(Ard-Chomhairle) of Sinn Fein called upon producers of, and dealers in,\r\nnecessary foodstuffs to \"co-operate in the imperative duty of saving Irish\r\npeople from starvation by selling only to buyers for exclusive Irish use\":\r\nit urged the workers in the country, on the railways and at the ports, to\r\nrefuse to co-operate in the exportation of food and called upon the public\r\nto treat food exporters as common enemies. The Food Committee established\r\nby the Sinn Fein Council sent circulars to the clergy of all denominations\r\nsoliciting their help both in conserving the food supply and in making\r\nsuitable arrangements for its distribution. It was not very easy either to\r\nsecure a food census or to induce those who made money by the export of\r\nfood to forego their profits. The principal export of potatoes was from\r\nAntrim, Down, Derry and Tyrone, counties in which Sinn Fein had very\r\nlittle prospect either of getting the requisite information from the\r\nfarmers or of inducing them to forego their profits. English dealers were\r\nwilling to pay large prices for Irish produce and Irish farmers were\r\napparently willing to go on selling until, as _New Ireland_ put it, there\r\nwould be nothing left in Ireland to eat except bank notes. The situation\r\nwas in all essentials what it had been during the closing years of the\r\neighteenth century when (as Arthur O'Connor pointed out) Ireland was\r\nsupplying the belligerents of Europe with food and leaving her own\r\npopulation to starve, while the traders waxed wealthy. The only difference\r\nwas that, the inducement then being a bounty paid by Parliament on\r\nexported corn, the inducement now was a bounty paid by the purchaser in\r\nEngland in the form of an enhanced price. It was a situation which, as the\r\nLabour Party was quick to point out, could not be met by any unofficial\r\norganization however energetic, such as the Sinn Fein Food Committee, but\r\nrequired official action. The Labour Party demanded that the Irish Food\r\nControl Committee should be strengthened and vested with executive powers,\r\nno longer remaining subordinate to the London Controller: until this was\r\ndone, private or unofficial advice or action was merely playing with the\r\nquestion. Whether Sinn Fein exerted, any but a slight influence on the\r\nexport of food may be doubted; but it certainly managed the other part of\r\nits task--the distribution of the available supplies--with a certain\r\nskill. Measures were concerted for purchasing supplies in counties where\r\nfood was relatively abundant and sending it to agents in districts where\r\nit was scarce. The usual abuses which attend attempts to supply food to a\r\npoor population could not, of course, be entirely eliminated, but on the\r\nwhole the experiment seems to have been generally successful. In Ennis,\r\nfor instance, the local Sinn Fein Club established a Sinn Fein market to\r\nwhich farmers brought their potatoes: the club purchased them at the\r\ncurrent price and distributed them to 150 poor families at cost: each\r\nfamily was provided with a card endorsed with the quantity of potatoes\r\nnecessary for its needs and on presentation of the card received the\r\npotatoes. The scheme was financed by some prominent men in Ennis who\r\nadvanced the necessary capital, the Sinn Fein Club being at the cost of\r\nthe working expenses of the scheme: there was \"no credit and no charity.\"\r\nAlthough this and similar schemes worked fairly well, and undoubtedly\r\nrelieved the situation appreciably in many districts, they were open to\r\nthe objection brought by the Labour Party that they were ineffective as\r\ncompared both with genuine co-operative effort on the part of the people\r\nthemselves and with official action taken by the County Councils or\r\nmunicipal authorities. They were, besides, likely to give rise to the\r\nquestion which _Irish Opinion_ (the Irish Labour weekly) put \"Is the\r\nobject political or economic?\" There is no doubt that the fact that Sinn\r\nFein was actively promoting measures of relief, while official action\r\ntended to produce a situation approaching to famine, was used as an\r\nargument in favour of the Sinn Fein policy in general. It was hardly to be\r\nexpected either that Sinn Feiners should not use the argument or that the\r\npublic should not think that there was something in it. The Labour Party's\r\ncriticisms were, from the economic point of view, perfectly sound. An\r\nIrish Food Control Committee with executive powers, authority in the\r\nhands of locally-elected bodies to conserve and distribute local supplies\r\nof food, was ideally the proper scheme: but the proper scheme was, as\r\nusual, unattainable and Sinn Fein was doing what was perhaps the only\r\nthing that could be done under the circumstances. And though the Labour\r\nParty urged its criticisms, it did not withhold its assistance and hearty\r\nsupport to the Sinn Fein scheme.\r\n\r\nThe result was to increase the growing popularity of Sinn Fein. It was\r\nseen that it had another than the purely political aspect, that its\r\nprinciples of self-reliance were capable of being applied with a success\r\nlimited only by the amount of popular support which they could command. It\r\nwas, at any rate, plain that if the people who controlled the food\r\nsupplies were all believers in Sinn Fein principles there need be no\r\nprospect of famine in Ireland, and the action of Sinn Fein (inadequate\r\nthough it may have been) at any rate contrasted favourably with the\r\nindifference and inefficiency of the official bodies appointed by the\r\nGovernment and with the helplessness of other political parties.\r\n\r\nThe popularity of Sinn Fein was further increased by the continued\r\nactivities of the Irish police authorities against its more prominent or\r\nactive adherents. If the Cabinet had decided to create an \"atmosphere\" for\r\nthe Convention by the release of the prisoners sentenced to penal\r\nservitude for their share in the Rising, an opposite \"atmosphere\" was\r\nbeing systematically generated by the Irish Executive. People were being\r\narrested all over the country for offences incomparably less serious from\r\nevery point of view than those committed by the people who had been\r\nreleased. The conclusion was drawn that the Government, while anxious to\r\nmake a display to the world of impartiality and good will by a spectacular\r\nact of clemency, was in reality determined to regard the active support of\r\nSinn Fein as a serious offence in the case of men too little before the\r\neyes of the world for their arrest to lead to widespread comment or\r\nindignation. Their action was held to be an indication of their resolve to\r\nprevent the spread of Sinn Fein principles until the Convention should\r\nhave presented a report palatable to the Cabinet: and Sinn Fein instead of\r\nsuffering by this action simply grew in its own esteem and in the eyes of\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe result of the South Armagh Election early in 1918, in which its\r\ncandidate was defeated, only spurred Sinn Fein to further exertions. The\r\nelection indicated more a desire \"to give the Convention a chance\" than a\r\ndeliberate judgment of the electorate in favour of the Parliamentary as\r\nagainst the Sinn Fein policy. But a \"chance given\" to the Convention was\r\nin reality an opportunity denied to Sinn Fein. The Convention was to\r\nproduce a scheme for the government of Ireland \"within the Empire.\" A\r\ntolerable and workable scheme produced unanimously (or nearly so) by the\r\nConvention would undoubtedly (or so it was thought) have to be accepted\r\nby the Cabinet; if such a scheme were accepted and put into operation, the\r\nfeeling of relief in Ireland would have been so deep and so general as to\r\ndeal to Sinn Fein, just when it was beginning to gain the ear of the\r\ncountry, a blow from which it might take long to recover, if it should\r\nrecover it for a generation. It was felt that a Sinn Fein victory in South\r\nArmagh would mean that the Convention might for all practical purposes\r\nadjourn indefinitely, while a victory for the Parliamentary Party meant\r\nthat it was given the opportunity, so far as Nationalist Ireland\r\nrepresented by this constituency was concerned, of producing a scheme of\r\nself-government wide enough to win the support of all Irishmen really\r\ndesirous of a reasonable step in advance.\r\n\r\nSinn Fein decided in the circumstances to put the real opinion of Ireland\r\non the question of independence to a definite test before the Convention\r\nshould have time to report in favour of something attractive to moderate\r\nmen, if offered, but falling short of independence. On St. Patrick's Day\r\n\"monster meetings\" were held all over Ireland, attended by the Volunteers\r\nwho mustered in force and by crowds which were certainly enthusiastic. At\r\nall of these meetings the following resolution was put in Irish and in\r\nEnglish and, according to the reports, passed everywhere with practical\r\nunanimity: \"Here on St. Patrick's Day we join with our fellow-countrymen\r\nat home and in foreign lands in proclaiming once more that Ireland is a\r\ndistinct nation whose just right is sovereign independence. This right has\r\nbeen asserted in every generation, has never been surrendered and never\r\nallowed to lapse. We call the nations to witness that to-day as in the\r\npast it is by force alone that England holds Ireland for her Empire and\r\nnot by the consent of the Irish; and that England's claim to have given\r\nthe Irish people 'self-determination' is a lie: her true attitude being\r\nshown by the recent ministerial statement that 'under no circumstances\r\ncould any English Government contemplate the ultimate independence of\r\nIreland'.\" In Dublin, Belfast and Clare these meetings were proclaimed and\r\ncould not be held--at least on the appointed day. In Belfast Mr. de Valera\r\naddressed the meeting at 11 o'clock on the night preceding, but when\r\nmidnight struck the gathering was dispersed by the police. But a \"monster\r\nmeeting\" is a thing of varying dimensions: even \"monster meetings\" held\r\nsimultaneously all over Ireland may not be attended by more than a\r\nfraction of the population. To put the matter beyond doubt it was decided\r\nto institute a plebiscite in favour of independence and to publish the\r\nnumbers who in each townland declared themselves in favour of it. While\r\nthe plebiscite was being taken Sinn Fein had again an opportunity of\r\n\"testing the feeling of the country\" at a parliamentary election. Mr. John\r\nRedmond had died on the 6th of March. He had fought for his policy to the\r\nlast with tenacity and dignity: through a long life he had displayed the\r\ncourage which once led the small and faithful band who refused to betray\r\nParnell: he had come to accept the limitations imposed upon his policy by\r\nEnglish feeling with a pride which preferred to regard them as the\r\ndictates of statesmanship: he never lost his courtesy, his confidence or\r\nhis belief in human sincerity. To Sinn Fein he had opposed an unbending\r\nhostility, and the temptation to replace him in the representation of\r\nWaterford by a Sinn Feiner was too great to be resisted. Sinn Fein\r\nsustained a heavy defeat at the poll, and this second reverse within a few\r\nmonths was taken to indicate the turning of the tide in favour of Mr.\r\nRedmond's policy. It really meant no more than that the electors of\r\nWaterford thought, what many other people thought with them, that the\r\nattempt to oust Mr. Redmond's son from sitting for his father's\r\nconstituency was a breach of the decencies of public life. Certainly the\r\nlanguage which some of the party used in speaking of Mr. Redmond was\r\ninexcusable and deserved the rebuff which it received.\r\n\r\nBut the report of the Convention, laid upon the table of the House of\r\nCommons early in April, overshadowed plebiscites and the results of\r\ncontested elections. Upon its reception by the Government the whole future\r\nof Ireland seemed to turn. But the report was difficult to master. The\r\nChairman of the Convention claimed that it had \"laid a foundation of Irish\r\nagreement unprecedented in history,\" but the actual record of the\r\nproceedings seemed at first blush open to a somewhat different\r\ninterpretation. The Nationalists had, it is true, offered large\r\nconcessions to the Unionists, but they were themselves divided upon\r\nquestions of principle of the very first importance; and while some of the\r\nUnionists were content to accept what was offered, provided the\r\nNationalists met the concession of this acceptance by a concession\r\ninfinitely greater, the Ulster Unionists appeared to have succeeded in\r\ncommitting themselves to nothing. If the Government were to attempt to\r\nlegislate for Ireland on the basis of the report the Ulster Unionists were\r\ncertain to produce the \"pledges\" that they would not be \"coerced\" and too\r\nmany responsible people had given these pledges to make the prospect of\r\nlegislation for Ireland a comfortable outlook for anybody. But not only\r\nwas the report difficult to interpret, not only did its publication put\r\nMinisters in an awkward position: it came at a most unfortunate time. The\r\nmilitary prospects of the Allies were clouded, and the Government had\r\ndecided to make a fresh call upon the man-power of the country. It was\r\nknown that in their perplexity they had considered the possibility of\r\nextending Conscription to Ireland, and to do so, equally with refraining\r\nfrom doing so, seemed to be a step of doubtful expediency.\r\n\r\nThe situation was complicated; but the handling of it by the Prime\r\nMinister was more complicated still. He elected to treat the question of\r\nHome Rule and the question of Irish Conscription concurrently while he\r\ndeclared that they were not interdependent. He justified the application\r\nof Conscription to Ireland on the merits: men were needed in France and\r\nthere were men to be had in Ireland: the Home Rule Act, accepted by the\r\nParliamentary Party and placed on the Statute Book, had given to\r\nParliament the right to legislate for Ireland upon matters of Imperial\r\nconcern. As for the Convention, he refused to regard the report as\r\ndisclosing that there had been \"substantial agreement,\" nevertheless he\r\nannounced that the Government would bring forward immediately such\r\nproposals for the future government of Ireland as seemed to be just. It\r\nwas common belief that so far as the Convention was concerned a failure to\r\narrive at \"substantial agreement\" absolved the Government from all\r\nobligation to legislate upon its proposals; an intention of legislating\r\nall the same appeared to be prompted by the desire to offer something in\r\nthe way of compensation for the unpalatable proposal of Conscription. But\r\nthe Premier insisted that any such interpretation of his proposal was\r\nerroneous: the two measures had nothing whatever to do with one another:\r\neach stood upon its own merits and each must be passed regardless of the\r\nother. But, having elected to take Conscription first, and having\r\nannounced his intention of forcing it through Parliament in spite of\r\ncriticism and of putting it into operation in Ireland in spite of\r\nopposition, he indulged himself in a glimpse at the prospects of a\r\nconscribed Ireland: \"when the young men of Ireland,\" he said, \"have been\r\nbrought in large numbers into the fighting line, it is important that they\r\nshould feel that they are not fighting for the purpose of establishing a\r\nprinciple abroad which is denied to them at home.\" But as if in fear that\r\nthis might imply some remote connection between Ireland's duty to fight\r\nand Ireland's right to be given the benefit of the principle it was asked\r\nto fight for, the Premier gave the most convincing proof of his sincerity\r\nin saying that Conscription for Ireland and Home Rule for Ireland did not\r\n\"stand together\"--Conscription was passed into law and Home Rule was\r\ndropped.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to conceive a course of action more nicely calculated to\r\ndemonstrate on a large scale the principal theses which Sinn Fein had been\r\npreaching for years. The demonstration was carried into every household in\r\nIreland in a form in which it could no longer be ignored. Conscription had\r\nnot been a palatable measure in England, and it had not been put into\r\nforce until the English people had agreed with practical unanimity that\r\nthey must submit to it: but the choice had been their own and no\r\nGovernment would have ventured even to propose it until the English people\r\nhad made up their minds beforehand to accept it when it should be\r\nproposed. In Australia it had been discussed and rejected; and no one\r\neither in England or anywhere else had questioned the right of the people\r\nof Australia to decline to conscribe themselves, though the interests of\r\nAustralia were as vitally involved in the issue of the war as the\r\ninterests of England. Ireland, on the other hand, while it was opposed to\r\nConscription, had no choice offered to it in the matter. It was decided\r\nupon by a Cabinet of which no Irishman was a member and it was to be\r\nenforced in spite not merely of the protests of Ireland but of the grave\r\nwarnings of a large number of Englishmen. To the argument that Ireland,\r\nbeing an integral part of the United Kingdom, must submit to the\r\nlegislation of Parliament whether it liked it or no, it was pointed out\r\nthat this argument had not been enforced against Ulster four years before;\r\nthat when Conscription had first been enforced in England it had been\r\nadmitted by Parliament that Ireland was a special case; that to assert\r\nthat Ireland was an integral part of the United Kingdom was to beg the\r\nvery question in dispute, since the national claim of Ireland had always\r\nbeen a claim for independence. Again, if the Home Rule Act was relied upon\r\n(as the Premier relied upon it) to prove that Ireland had accepted the\r\nauthority of Parliament in Imperial matters and acknowledged its supreme\r\njurisdiction in all matters pertaining to war and peace, it was pointed\r\nout that the Government which now invoked it had persistently refused to\r\nput it into operation. Yet the Premier, who, more than any other single\r\nman, had shown himself hostile in deed, while friendly in word, to Irish\r\nclaims, himself admitted that Irishmen serving in the army in the then\r\ncondition of Irish affairs would be fighting abroad to enforce a principle\r\ndenied in the government of their own country. The conclusion which Sinn\r\nFein drew was that the English Government was prepared in defiance of\r\npublic feeling, justice and constitutional practice to enforce\r\nConscription upon Ireland by naked force: that it had no intention of\r\ngranting Ireland any form of self-government, and that it was the duty of\r\nIrishmen to organize \"an effective and protracted resistance.\" But, though\r\nprepared to resist, it continued to argue. It pointed out that the Irish\r\nParliament, whose powers had been transferred by the Act of Union to the\r\nParliament of England, had possessed no power of Conscription and could\r\nnot transfer a power which it did not possess; any power of Conscription,\r\ntherefore, possessed by Parliament over Ireland must rest upon some other\r\nbasis, if it existed at all: that there was no legal process by which a\r\nman could be deprived of life or liberty except on conviction for a crime:\r\nand that this was why, even in the case of Conscription in England, Mr.\r\nAsquith, a good constitutional lawyer, \"was careful to declare that he\r\nbased the conscription of Englishmen on the basis, not of State duty or\r\ncompulsion, but of the universal assent of the English people.\" If this\r\nassent was lacking, as it undoubtedly was, in the case of Ireland, it\r\nfollowed that to enforce Conscription was an act of naked injustice.\r\n\r\nBut no elaborate argument was needed to rouse a people convinced at last\r\nthat they were in the vortex of Charybdis. They resented what now appeared\r\nas the duplicity with which for months their attention had been\r\ndeliberately and elaborately focussed upon the alluring mysteries of the\r\nConvention while they drifted quietly and securely towards the edge of the\r\nwhirlpool. They saw the cloudy structure of the Convention melt and float\r\naway, disclosing what it had covered; and they prepared for a desperate\r\nstruggle.\r\n\r\nThe feeling was not confined to Sinn Fein. The Parliamentary Party left\r\nWestminster in a body and crossed to Ireland to help in the national\r\nresistance. The Labour Party joined hands with them and with Sinn Fein in\r\nthe universal crisis. It involved for the Parliamentary Party a tragic and\r\nfatal break with the past. It was the end of all their hopes, of all their\r\ninfluence, of their very existence; and as they joined the Sinn Fein and\r\nLabour representatives round the table of the Mansion House Conference,\r\nsummoned by the Lord Mayor of Dublin, they must have felt that they were\r\ninvited by virtue of what they had once been rather than by virtue of what\r\nthey were; they were there as the men who had relied on the broken reed,\r\n\"whereon if a man lean it will go into his hand and pierce him.\"\r\n\r\nAfter its first meeting on April 18th, the Mansion House Conference issued\r\nthe following declaration:--\"Taking our stand on Ireland's separate and\r\ndistinct nationhood and affirming the principle of liberty that the\r\nGovernments of nations derive their just powers from the consent of the\r\ngoverned, we deny the right of the British Government or any external\r\nauthority to impose compulsory military service in Ireland against the\r\nclearly expressed will of the Irish people. The passing of the\r\nConscription Bill by the British House of Commons must be regarded as a\r\ndeclaration of war on the Irish nation. The alternative to accepting it as\r\nsuch is to surrender our liberties and to acknowledge ourselves slaves. It\r\nis in direct violation of the rights of small nationalities to\r\nself-determination, which even the Prime Minister of England--now\r\npreparing to employ naked militarism and force his Act upon\r\nIreland--himself officially announced as an essential condition for peace\r\nat the Peace Congress. The attempt to enforce it will be an unwarrantable\r\naggression, which we call upon all Irishmen to resist by the most\r\neffective means at their disposal.\" On the same day the Conference decided\r\nto ask the co-operation of the Irish Catholic Bishops who had been\r\nsummoned by Cardinal Logue to meet at Maynooth. The Bishops, after hearing\r\na deputation from the Mansion House Conference, issued at once the\r\nfollowing manifesto: \"An attempt is being made to force Conscription on\r\nIreland against the will of the Irish nation and in defiance of the\r\nprotests of its leaders. In view especially of the historic relations\r\nbetween the two countries from the very beginning up to this moment, we\r\nconsider that Conscription forced in this way upon Ireland is an\r\noppressive and inhuman law, which the Irish people have a right to resist\r\nby every means that are consonant with the law of God. We wish to remind\r\nour people that there is a higher Power which controls the affairs of men.\r\nThey have in their hands the means of conciliating that Power by strict\r\nadherence to the Divine law, by more earnest attention to their religious\r\nduties, and by fervent and persevering prayer. In order to secure the aid\r\nof the Holy Mother of God, who shielded our people in the days of their\r\ngreatest trials, we have already sanctioned a National Novena in honour of\r\nOur Lady of Lourdes, commencing on the 3rd May, to secure general and\r\ndomestic peace. We also exhort the heads of families to have the Rosary\r\nrecited every evening with the intention of protecting the spiritual and\r\ntemporal welfare of our beloved country and bringing us safe through this\r\ncrisis of unparalleled gravity.\"\r\n\r\nMany Sinn Feiners sincerely deplored the step which the Conference had\r\ntaken in calling upon the Bishops for an official manifesto. Its wording\r\nseemed to rule out of existence the section of Irish Nationalists who\r\nbelonged to the Protestant faith and to identify a national question with\r\na particular creed. Certainly as a mere question of tactics the manifesto\r\nwas of doubtful wisdom. It was certain to raise, and it did raise, the cry\r\nof the \"priest in politics.\" From the mouths of the Ulster Party the\r\ncriticism might be disregarded, for they had themselves four years before\r\ninduced the Protestant churches in Ulster to pass official resolutions\r\nagainst Home Rule. But it was different when the English newspapers began\r\nto raise the \"No Popery\" cry and to write as if Sinn Fein were a purely\r\nCatholic party which it had never ceased to protest it was not. But in\r\nfact the vexed question of the relation of the Church to the civil power,\r\na question not to be disposed of in a sentence, did not fairly arise from\r\nthe Bishops' pronouncement. The main gist of it was contained in two\r\npropositions neither of which was theological: the proposition that\r\nConscription was an oppressive and inhuman law was (whether right or\r\nwrong) an ordinary statement of opinion upon a purely mundane matter: the\r\nproposition that such a law might be resisted by any means consonant with\r\nthe law of God was the statement not of theology, whether Catholic or\r\nProtestant, but of ordinary ethics, accidentally theistic. But the\r\nconcluding sentences of the manifesto threw their light backwards upon the\r\nessential statements, and the resistance to Conscription was represented\r\nas one more incident in the long struggle between free institutions and\r\nthe power of the Roman Church.\r\n\r\nNationalist Ireland, however, needed no incentive from the Bishops to\r\nresist. It was presented with a clear cut issue which could not be evaded,\r\nwhich the Cabinet by its decision had raised in its most acute form. If\r\nIreland submitted quietly to Conscription then it acknowledged that it\r\nstood to the British Parliament in exactly the same relation as did\r\nYorkshire or Middlesex: if, on the other hand, Ireland were a nation, even\r\nif it were a nation within the British Empire, it had the right to decide\r\nfor itself on a question involving issues so vital to its future. This was\r\nthe alternative which Sinn Fein put in vehement and passionate language\r\nbefore the country and the reply of Nationalist Ireland was practically\r\nunanimous. Nearly every Nationalist in Ireland took the anti-Conscription\r\npledge \"Denying the right of the British Government to enforce compulsory\r\nservice in this country, we pledge ourselves solemnly to one another to\r\nresist Conscription by the most effective means at our disposal.\"\r\n\r\nBut not only was the intention of the Government to enforce Conscription\r\nregarded as a challenge to Ireland, as a denial of its nationality; a\r\ndeeper purpose was supposed to lie behind it. The record of the Government\r\nduring the war in its dealings with Ireland had not been such as to\r\npersuade Nationalists of any section that it was either friendly or\r\nsincere. It was believed that, coupled with the desire to obtain recruits,\r\nand the intention of treating the Irish claim to a national existence as a\r\nthing of no consequence in order to secure them, there was the desire\r\nfurther to deplete Ireland of its Nationalist population and render its\r\ngovernment by England easier in consequence. This belief did not always\r\nfind public expression, but it existed and had much to do with the\r\nvehemence of the resistance. Apart from this consideration, the motives of\r\nthe opposition and the feelings with which it was connected were\r\nsuccinctly given by _New Ireland_. \"At the basis of the opposition to\r\nConscription stand the moral rights of Ireland, the very rock as it were\r\nof Irish nationality, the rights to choose her own future and to protect\r\nher people from the horrors of the European War. If there were any\r\nstatesmanship left in England to-day it would look to creating harmony\r\nbetween Ireland and England, knowing that the real interest of nations is\r\nbuilt thereon. Real statesmanship would grant Ireland the fullest\r\nliberty, knowing that the friendship of Ireland is essential, and that it\r\ncan only be based on the fundamentals of national honour, namely, liberty\r\nand justice. Instead English politicians vainly imagine that coercion, the\r\npress gang, and the train of consequent tragedy will somehow win the\r\nallegiance and support of Ireland.\"\r\n\r\nThe most spectacular demonstration of protest was made by the Irish Labour\r\nParty. A conference of fifteen hundred delegates convened in Dublin by the\r\nIrish Trades Union Congress, in adopting a resolution to resist\r\nConscription \"in every way that to us seems feasible,\" asserting \"our\r\nclaims for independent status as a nation in the international movement\r\nand the right of self-determination as a nation as to what action or\r\nactions our people should take on questions of political or economic\r\nissues,\" called upon Irish workers to abstain from all work on April 23rd\r\nas \"a demonstration of fealty to the cause of Labour and Ireland.\" This\r\nwas the first occasion in Western Europe on which it had been decided to\r\ncall a general national strike: and the strike in Ireland was general\r\nexcept in North-east Ulster. The Labour Party however had a point of view\r\nsomewhat different from that of Sinn Fein. Labour was opposed to\r\nConscription on principle, and would have, unlike Sinn Fein, opposed it\r\neven if agreed to by an Irish Parliament. Their view had been clearly\r\nexpressed more than a year before when, after two years of silence, Irish\r\nLabour began again to publish a weekly paper. _Irish Opinion_ in its first\r\nnumber, published on December 1st, 1917, had said, \"We shall resolutely\r\noppose the conscription of Irish people, whether for military or\r\nindustrial purposes. The very idea of compulsory service is abhorrent to\r\nus and we shall assist in every way every effort of our people to resist\r\nthe imposition of such an iniquitous system upon us.\"\r\n\r\nHowever neither minor differences on the subject of Conscription nor,\r\nindeed, major differences upon other points, prevented all sections of\r\nNationalist opinion from assisting each other heartily in the crisis. A\r\ncommon statement of Ireland's case against Conscription was drawn up for\r\npublication and the Lord Mayor of Dublin was deputed to proceed to America\r\nto lay the protest of Ireland before the President of the United States.\r\nThe Government showed no signs of yielding to the opposition. The Lord\r\nLieutenant known to be opposed to the policy of the Cabinet was recalled,\r\nand his place was taken by Field Marshal Lord French with whom Mr. Shortt\r\nwas appointed Chief Secretary, one of a considerable number of \"English\r\nHome Rulers\" who have at various times been appointed to the post of Chief\r\nSecretary for Ireland by virtue of their profession of the belief that no\r\nsuch post should be permitted to exist, and whose conduct in it has been\r\nsuch as might be expected from such persons. It was announced with\r\nofficial emphasis that no opposition would deflect the Government from its\r\npurpose. The Lord Mayor of Dublin was refused permission to leave Ireland\r\nuntil he should first have submitted for the approval of Lord French the\r\nmemorial which he was charged to convey to the President of the United\r\nStates. But nothing altered the opposition to Conscription, and the\r\nGovernment had to be content with the suspension of the sword.\r\n\r\nWhen the formidable nature of the task they had undertaken dawned upon the\r\nLord Lieutenant and his Chief Secretary, it was decided by the Irish\r\nGovernment to cut the sinews of the opposition by the arrest of those who\r\nwere chiefly responsible for fomenting it. But it was clearly impossible\r\nto clap the Catholic Bishops and the Mansion House Conference into gaol in\r\na body. It was plain that Sinn Fein was the chief centre of the trouble,\r\nbeing the only political party whose principles furnished a logical ground\r\nfor opposition to the conscription of Ireland by Act of Parliament. The\r\ntwo Sinn Fein members of the Mansion House Conference, Messrs. de Valera\r\nand Griffith, with a number of less prominent Sinn Feiners, were deported\r\nand imprisoned. But this was a course which required some explanation.\r\nThey were not the only people prominent in the Anti-Conscription campaign;\r\nand in any case English public opinion while, on the whole, indignant with\r\nthe attitude of Ireland towards compulsory service, was becoming somewhat\r\nuneasy as to happenings in Ireland and inclined to question the entire\r\nwisdom of the Irish Executive. Accordingly, it was asserted that the\r\narrested Sinn Feiners had been guilty of complicity in a German plot. The\r\nex-Lord Lieutenant, Lord Wimborne, during whose tenure of office the\r\ndiscovery of the plot (it was said) began to be made, publicly and flatly\r\ndenied all knowledge of it, and expressed disbelief in its existence. The\r\nPremier announced that he had seen the evidence (which nothing, however,\r\nwould induce him to divulge) and that it was even as the Irish Government\r\nhad said. Public opinion however was still unsatisfied, and the Irish\r\noffice issued a statement on the subject in which the Chief Secretary\r\nargued (\"for even though vanquished he could argue still\") from the\r\nhistory of Sinn Fein for the previous three or four years, and from\r\ncertain financial transactions between Count Bernstorff and some\r\nIrish-Americans before America entered the war, that some person or\r\npersons in Ireland had been in communication with Germany for a\r\ntreasonable purpose. However that may have been, there was no direct\r\nevidence connecting any of the prisoners with any of these transactions,\r\nand in fact nearly all of them had been in gaol in England at the time\r\nwhen the transactions took place. The official statement was pitilessly\r\nanalysed in a pamphlet published by _New Ireland_ entitled \"The Plot:\r\nGerman or English?\" the only result of the whole affair being that\r\nofficial credit in Ireland received its last shock. No further attempts\r\nwere made to provide non-political reasons for political arrests: it was\r\njudged better that the Executive should rely upon the extraordinary powers\r\nconferred upon it by the Defence of the Realm Act (though the machinery\r\nprovided by what was known as \"the ordinary law\" in Ireland seemed\r\nsufficiently complete without it) to arrest, without the necessity of\r\ncharge or trial, any persons who made themselves prominent for the\r\nadvocacy of Sinn Fein or Republican politics. In July Sinn Fein, the\r\nGaelic League, Cumann na mBan and the Irish Volunteers were declared to be\r\n\"dangerous associations\" to which Irish men and women would in future\r\nbelong at their own risk. Concerts, hurling matches, literary\r\ncompetitions, were prohibited all over Ireland by military force when they\r\nwere held under the auspices of persons politically obnoxious to the\r\nGovernment. Government became a matter of having enough troops in the\r\ncountry to ensure that the Executive was able to do precisely what it\r\npleased. Ireland was treated frankly as hostile and occupied territory,\r\nand the last pretence of constitutional government was finally abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe reply of Sinn Fein to the arrest of Mr. Griffith for complicity in the\r\n\"German Plot\" had been his triumphant election for East Cavan. This was\r\nalmost the last seat which the once powerful Parliamentary Party ventured\r\nto contest. Its co-operation with Sinn Fein in the question of\r\nConscription had been, not an alliance but an operation conducted in\r\ncommon, and on other points each was at perfect liberty to pursue its own\r\npath. But the junction of forces had only succeeded in bringing into clear\r\nrelief the essential incompatibility of the Sinn Fein and the\r\nParliamentary policies, and it became evident that the Irish public would\r\nhave to choose definitely which it should finally adopt. Sinn Fein, which\r\nrefused to compromise on the essential principle of Ireland's distinct and\r\nindependent nationhood, could argue with considerable force that on this\r\nassumption alone could Ireland object to Conscription with confidence and\r\nmoral justification--that if Ireland were not a nation, but a province or\r\na dependency, then the resistance to Conscription was legally and morally\r\nwithout a sound basis. It was extremely difficult for the Parliamentary\r\nParty to counter this argument: and in point of fact some of them did not\r\ntry to counter it but frankly dissociated themselves from the\r\nAnti-Conscription policy. It was perfectly clear that the Home Rule Act\r\nreserved such powers to Parliament as to make the conscription of Ireland,\r\nas part of a general measure of Conscription for the United Kingdom, a\r\nstep which Parliament would legally be entitled to take and which, once\r\nthe Home Rule Act was accepted by Ireland as satisfactory (and the\r\nParliamentary Party had declared that it was) Ireland would have no moral\r\nright to resist. The Party began to shift its ground: it could no longer,\r\nin view of Irish feeling, remain advocates of a settlement which made\r\nConscription possible: it would not go the whole way with Sinn Fein and\r\ndeclare that no settlement would be satisfactory which did not acknowledge\r\nthe right of Ireland to independent nationhood, to self-determination and\r\nthe right to choose its own form of government. The Party settled down\r\nunofficially to the advocacy of a form of Home Rule which should ensure to\r\nIreland piecemeal and in detail, by enactment of Parliament, as large an\r\nindependence as was possessed by the self-governing Dominions, without the\r\nformal and definite renunciation of the right of Parliament to decide the\r\nextent to which Ireland should be independent. This of course left the\r\nquestion of principle precisely where it was. But on the question of\r\nprinciple Sinn Fein was adamant, and Nationalist Ireland supported Sinn\r\nFein by an overwhelming majority.\r\n\r\nThe relationship between Sinn Fein and the Hierarchy was more enigmatic\r\nand gave rise to much speculation. One view was that Sinn Fein had\r\n'captured' the Hierarchy, another was that the Hierarchy had 'captured'\r\nSinn Fein. Neither view was, of course, correct. Individual bishops may\r\nhave sympathized (individual priests certainly sympathized in large\r\nnumbers) with Sinn Fein: but it is certain that quite a large number of\r\npriests and bishops did not. While it is true that resistance to\r\nConscription could not logically be justified except upon the principles\r\nof Sinn Fein, bishops had the same right to be illogical as members of the\r\nParliamentary Party. Under the stress of the moment, in the desire to save\r\ntheir flocks from the danger that threatened them, they had joined forces\r\nwith a party which before that they had not approved of and which they\r\nwere not bound to approve of afterwards. Sinn Fein, at any rate, was under\r\nno illusion as to the feelings of some of the Bishops. The curate of\r\nCrossna, Father O'Flanagan, had taken a very active part on the side of\r\nSinn Fein in the East Cavan election. Shortly afterwards he was deprived\r\nby his bishop, the Most Rev. Dr. Coyne, of all his faculties as a priest,\r\nincluding the right to say Mass. The technical offence for which he was\r\npunished in this way was that of having addressed meetings within the\r\nboundaries of three parishes in Cavan without first obtaining the\r\npermission of the local parish priests. Everybody knew that the real\r\nreason for his punishment was not the technical offence but the fact that\r\nhis speeches had been strongly (and even violently) Sinn Fein. The people\r\nof Crossna retorted by shutting up the parish church and refusing to allow\r\nMass to be said in it by anyone else. _Nationality_, in reporting the\r\nfacts, said of Father O'Flanagan: \"He has been condemned to the most harsh\r\njudgment that can be meted out to a priest by his bishop and until that\r\nwrong has been set right Sinn Fein will stand by Father O'Flanagan\"; and\r\npractically every Sinn Feiner in Ireland agreed with these words. When\r\nbishops seemed (as many of them did) to go out of their way to criticise\r\nin pastorals and public letters the policy or the tactics of Sinn Fein,\r\ntheir action was resented and openly, even stringently, criticised in the\r\nSinn Fein papers: but all this was done not only without any trace of\r\nanti-clericalism (in the proper sense of the word) but with what sometimes\r\nseemed an almost exaggerated deference to the office and sacred functions\r\nof the bishop as such. As a matter of fact the Catholic Church in Ireland\r\nduring the nineteenth century has always been on the side of law and\r\norder. It has had a strong bias towards constituted authority, as was to\r\nbe expected from a branch of the most conservative institution in the\r\nworld. It excommunicated the Fenians, it opposed the Land League, it\r\ncondemned the Rising. It is hardly too much to say that Ireland would have\r\nbeen ungovernable but for the influence of the Church. It raised its\r\nvoice against outrage and murder in language beside which the\r\ndenunciations of politicians sound tame and flaccid. If it has meddled in\r\npolitics (as it has) it has done no more than the Protestant Churches in\r\nIreland, every one of which is \"in politics\" up to the neck.\r\n\r\nAnd the co-operation of Labour and Sinn Fein in the opposition to\r\nConscription by no means meant either that Labour had become Sinn Fein or\r\nthat Sinn Fein had adopted the Labour programme. In fact its relation to\r\nLabour is a problem which Sinn Fein has been very long in solving. The\r\nalliance between Republican Volunteers and the Citizen Army in the Rising\r\neffected no more than a temporary and partial union. The very first number\r\nof _Irish Opinion_ had some very open criticism of the attitude of Sinn\r\nFein to Irish Labour. The Sinn Fein Convention of November 1st, 1917, had\r\npassed two Labour resolutions, one of which affirmed the right of Labour\r\nto a \"fair and reasonable\" wage: the other was in favour of Irish Labour\r\nsevering its connection with British Trades Unions. On the first of these\r\n_Irish Opinion_ remarked: \"The resolution of the Sinn Fein Convention\r\nconceding to Irish Labour the right to fair and reasonable wages was not\r\nby any means encouraging. It was a resolution to which the assent of even\r\nMr. W. M. Murphy might have been secured. It did not go far enough, and it\r\nbore upon the face of it timidity and trepidation. The Labour demand\r\nto-day goes rather beyond fair and reasonable wages: the British\r\nGovernment is prepared to offer, in fact has actually offered, some share\r\nin direction to British Labour. This being so, there is not much to be\r\ngained from Mr. de Valera's statement in his Mansion House speech 'that in\r\na free Ireland, with the social conditions that obtained in Ireland,\r\nLabour had a far better chance than it would have in capitalist England.'\r\n'Our Labour policy,' continued Mr. de Valera, 'is a policy of a free\r\ncountry, and we ask Labour to join with us to free the country. We\r\nrecognize that we can never free it without Labour. And we say, when\r\nLabour frees this country--helps to free it--Labour can look for its own\r\nshare of its patrimony.' We agree that 'to free the country' is an object\r\nworthy of all the devotion that men can give to it, but at the same time\r\nwe would urge that, pending this devoutly-to-be-wished-for consummation,\r\nmen and women must live and rear the families upon which the future\r\nIreland depends. What Mr. de Valera asks in effect is that Labour should\r\nwait till freedom is achieved before it claims 'its share of its\r\npatrimony.' There are free countries, even Republics, where Labour claims\r\n'its share in its patrimony' in vain. We can work for freedom, and we\r\nwill, but at the same time we'll claim our share of our patrimony when and\r\nwhere opportunity offers.\" This is to put the issue squarely. Labour was\r\nnot going to commit itself blindfold to any policy of \"ignoring\"\r\nindiscriminately all \"English law,\" when by recognizing it any practical\r\nadvantage was to be gained. Labour had too keen an eye to the realities\r\nof life to refuse a gift from the left hand because the right hand had\r\nsmitten it or picked its pocket. It was prepared to settle its account\r\nwith the owner of both hands when opportunity offered, but, for the\r\npresent, \"a man must live.\" \"Fleshpots or Freedom\" might form an\r\nattractive motto for the front page of _New Ireland_, but Labour saw no\r\nvirtue (since Freedom's back was turned anyhow) in leaving the pots\r\nuntasted on a point of honour. The resolution calling upon Irish Labour to\r\nwithdraw from association with English Labour was flatly ignored. Irish\r\nLabour was, and intended to remain, international: it was not going to\r\nrefuse co-operation with Labour in France or Belgium--it appointed\r\ndelegates to the Stockholm Conference--and it saw no reason to refuse\r\nco-operation with Labour in England. Besides, without the help of English\r\nLabour it felt unable to stand alone. And Labour, while it sympathized\r\nwith the demand for Irish independence, did not wish to commit itself to\r\nany step which would make it more difficult than it need be to win the\r\nco-operation of the Unionist workingmen of Belfast and the North.\r\nCuriously enough, while Sinn Fein was calling upon Irish Labour to\r\nwithdraw from membership of English Trades Unions, the Unionist leaders in\r\nUlster were trying to induce Belfast Labour to do the same thing: but\r\nwhile Sinn Fein objected to the English Labour Party because it was\r\nEnglish, the Ulster politicians objected to it because it was in favour of\r\nHome Rule. Among the Sinn Fein papers, _New Ireland_, while faithful to\r\nthe resolution of the Convention, saw most clearly the reasons which\r\nexplained the Labour attitude and, while expressing the hope that a\r\nseverance from the English Unions would eventually occur, pleaded for\r\ntoleration and for, in the meantime, a free hand for Labour.\r\n\r\nBut the Sinn Fein difficulty in regard to Labour lay deeper than any mere\r\nquestion of tactics. The leaders of Irish Labour might be Republicans, but\r\nthey were also largely Socialists, and where Socialism is suspected the\r\nChurch has to be reckoned with. James Connolly, the revered leader of\r\nIrish Labour, had been (though he died a sincere Catholic) supposed to\r\nhave come into conflict with the Church for his opinions on social\r\nquestions. His associate, James Larkin, had more than once furnished a\r\ntext for some very plain speaking in pastorals and from the altar for the\r\nalleged subversive and immoral tendency of his teaching on Labour\r\nquestions. During the General Election of 1918 a sentence from James\r\nConnolly's writings, which had been quoted on a Sinn Fein election poster,\r\nwas the subject of a bitter and prolonged controversy, during which Sinn\r\nFein was challenged by a militant Churchman either to repudiate Connolly's\r\npolitical philosophy or to declare itself opposed to the authoritative\r\nteaching of the Church. Sinn Fein, very wisely, did neither: but it was\r\nfelt very generally that while this might be wisdom for the moment, it was\r\nnot wisdom for all time: and Sinn Fein has still to formulate its social\r\nphilosophy.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of the war made no difference in the government of Ireland\r\nexcept that more troops might be expected to be available for the\r\nmaintenance of law and order. Martial law was not relaxed or revoked: the\r\nCompetent Military Authority retained unimpaired over large areas of\r\nIreland the power to arrest and imprison (often for long periods) persons\r\ncharged with every variety of offence which could be interpreted as\r\ndangerous to the prestige and efficiency of that form of government which\r\nis best administered under the sanction of a courtmartial. Men, women and\r\nchildren were arrested upon charges not specified and committed to prison\r\nfor periods impossible to ascertain either from the authorities who sent\r\nthem, or the authorities who kept them, there. It was under such\r\ncircumstances that Ireland was asked to take part in the Victory Election\r\nof 1918. The electors of Great Britain were asked to give a \"mandate\" to\r\nthe British representatives at the Peace Conference, and \"to strengthen\r\ntheir hands\" in exacting from the Central Empires and their Allies the\r\nfull measure of punishment. Ireland decided to give a \"mandate\" which was\r\nneither asked for nor desired and to \"strengthen the hands\" of the Peace\r\nPlenipotentiaries in demanding that for which the war had ostensibly been\r\nfought--the freedom of small nations. It was known that the Parliamentary\r\nParty would retain only a fraction of the seats it once held and that Sinn\r\nFein would be in a majority. For a time it seemed as if the verdict of the\r\nmajority might be weakened by the intrusion of Labour candidates who,\r\nthough most of them were Sinn Feiners in point of fact and all of them\r\nwere bound by the Labour Party not to attend Parliament except when\r\nordered by the Labour Congress, would give no pledge of absolute and rigid\r\nabstention from the English Parliament and were Labour candidates first\r\nand Sinn Feiners afterwards. At one time it seemed as if an acute conflict\r\nbetween Sinn Fein and Labour might occur. But the Labour Party,\r\nrecognizing the extreme importance of Ireland having an opportunity of\r\ndelivering an unequivocal verdict in the most important election that had\r\nbeen held for a generation, finally agreed to withdraw its candidates and\r\nto allow the electorate to decide on the political question only. The\r\ndecision was conclusive on the question. Out of 106 members returned for\r\nIrish constituencies, 73 were Sinn Fein candidates, pledged to abstention\r\nfrom the English Parliament and to the claim of Irish independence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe months before the European War broke out saw Nationalist Ireland\r\npractically unanimous in its support of the Home Rule legislation of the\r\nLiberal Government, ready to be reckoned as a part of the British Empire,\r\nprepared to acknowledge the supremacy of the Imperial Parliament, content\r\nwith an Irish Parliament charged only with the control of a number of\r\nmatters of domestic concern. Though the policy of the Home Rule Act had\r\nbeen definitely and deliberately adopted by the English electorate, it was\r\ndefeated by threats of armed resistance on the part of a minority of\r\nIrishmen, backed by promises of support from a minority of Englishmen, and\r\nby the refusal of the Liberal Government either to vindicate its own\r\nconstitutional authority or to appeal to the country to do so for it. The\r\nGovernment put itself in the position of seeming to prefer in England the\r\nconciliation of its enemies to the satisfaction of its friends, and in\r\nIreland to acknowledge the claim of a minority to veto the legitimate\r\nexpectations of the majority. Occupying this position at home, it plunged\r\ninto a war in Europe to vindicate \"international morality\" and \"the rights\r\nof small nations,\" as a protest against the doctrine that the force of\r\narms is superior to the force of justice and law. The month after the war\r\nended saw Nationalist Ireland still claiming and still denied (in\r\nobedience to the same obstructing forces) the right of self-determination:\r\nbut the self-determination sought was no longer that in which before the\r\nwar it had been content to acquiesce. It held that the war, which it had\r\ndone something to win, had secured to the weaker nationalities (if the\r\npublic and reiterated professions of the victors were not meant\r\ndeliberately to deceive the world as to their intentions) the right to\r\ntheir own national existence, independent of the claims and the interests\r\nof the stronger nations by whom they had been subjugated. It held that\r\nduring the war the rights, the interests, the feelings and the liberty of\r\nIreland had been treated by the English Government with so much\r\nindifference and disdain as to make the future subordination of Ireland to\r\nEnglish domination a prospect distasteful to Irishmen and a position\r\ninjurious to Irish interests. It revived the claim of Ireland to\r\nindependence, declaring that it was justified alike by history and by the\r\ncommon consent of Europe and America, and as a first step in the assertion\r\nof that claim refused for the first time since the Act of Union to send\r\nrepresentatives to sit in the English Parliament. The forces which\r\nproduced so serious an alteration in the attitude of Ireland have been\r\ndescribed in the foregoing pages.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the war the only part of Ireland whose political outlook\r\nremained unaltered was the Unionist North-east. Upon the indurated surface\r\nof its political conscience nothing that had happened either in Ireland or\r\nout of it had produced the least effect. Alone in Europe the Ulster\r\nUnionist seemed to regard the war as a detachable episode with (so far as\r\nhe was concerned) no political implications. He adopted the same\r\nstandpoint, used the same language and expected it to meet with the same\r\napproving response from the same people. The changed attitude of other\r\npeople was attributed by him to treachery, to disloyalty, to lack of fixed\r\nprinciple. By an adroit use of his opportunities during the war he managed\r\nto secure his position: he could point to the loyalty alike of those of\r\nhis political faith who had enlisted and of those who had not enlisted:\r\nthe former had done their duty to the Empire--the latter had performed\r\ntheir duty to the Government by providing it with a perpetual incentive to\r\nthe conscription of Ireland. He had collected \"pledges\" from all who cared\r\nto give them that his position would be respected. To rely upon the\r\n\"pledge\" of a politician as a bulwark against the advance of political\r\nideas may seem a somewhat imbecile proceeding: but it was not in his case\r\nso imbecile as it looked. He was shrewd enough to see that what European\r\nstatesmen were doing was not by any means in accordance with what they\r\nwere saying, and he decided (distrusting \"ideas\" of all kinds) to stake\r\nhis future upon the relative permanence of things as they were rather than\r\nupon the doubtful advent of things as they ought to be.\r\n\r\nSinn Fein was the opposite of all this. It appealed alike from force and\r\nfrom fact to an ideal justice. Unable to win independence from a power\r\nboth strong enough to coerce it and interested for economic and military\r\nreasons in retaining its hold upon Ireland, it refused to ask for\r\n\"pledges\" which it felt sure would be broken, even if given, it refused to\r\nplead its case before a court whose interests were engaged against it in\r\nadvance. It preferred to appeal to its rights, though there was no\r\ntribunal before which its plea could come. It hoped that at the Peace\r\nConference the principle of self-determination could not be insisted upon\r\nas against Germany, without Germany claiming that it should be\r\nacknowledged in the case of Ireland. To its dismay and (it would seem) to\r\nits surprise Germany was not represented at the discussions: the Peace was\r\ndictated by a body in which none but the victors were represented and of\r\nwhich the object was not so much to establish a principle as to enforce a\r\nsettlement, even at the risk of establishing a precedent. The claim of\r\nSinn Fein that Ireland should be represented at the Conference as an\r\ninterested party was brushed aside, contemptuously by the representatives\r\nof England and France, shamefacedly by the representative of America. The\r\nLeague of Nations which the Peace Conference set up was expressly\r\nconstructed to prevent interference with the sovereign rights of its chief\r\nmembers as they existed at the time it was constructed: the right of\r\nEngland to retain whatever dominion it pleases over Ireland is guaranteed\r\nby the League of Nations in advance. Disappointed of the hopes placed in\r\nthe Peace Conference and the League of Nations, Sinn Fein has to rely\r\neither on the interference in its favour of some Power whose friendship\r\nEngland cannot disregard (an interference rendered less easy than it was\r\nby the very League of Nations which was expected to make it easier) or on\r\nthe gradual and silent force of European opinion, or on the result of some\r\nfuture war.\r\n\r\nSinn Fein takes its stand upon the proposition that Ireland is a nation\r\nand upon the assertion that all nations have a just claim to independence.\r\nThe proposition cannot be controverted except by arguments which go to\r\nprove that no such thing as a nation exists, and the assertion that all\r\nnations have a just claim to independence is like the assertion that all\r\nmen have a right to be free: each is admitted in principle, but the\r\nprinciple is subject in practice to so many modifications that to say that\r\na nation is free is to say what may mean as many different things as there\r\nare nations called free. A nation may be politically free and economically\r\ndependent, or vice versa: each of these conditions may be of various\r\ndegrees on each side: and each of these again may be combined with varying\r\ndegrees of moral, social and intellectual dependence.\r\n\r\nSinn Fein aims at the complete political, the complete economical and the\r\ncomplete moral and intellectual independence of Ireland. It has first to\r\nsecure independence of England, and, having secured that, to avoid falling\r\ninto dependence on any other Power. Its immediate problem is the means of\r\nsecuring independence of England. To induce England to acknowledge the\r\nindependence of Ireland (to force her being out of the question, unless\r\nallies are to appear in the future) is no solution, as is abundantly\r\nproved by the history of their relations: the independence acknowledged in\r\n1783 was recalled in 1800 and has been denied ever since. To induce the\r\nLeague of Nations, as at present constituted, to acknowledge the\r\nindependence of Ireland is out of the question: if it were reconstituted\r\nso as to make it possible for it to do so, mere recognition of\r\nindependence would be useless, unless the League were in a position to\r\nguarantee that it would continue to be recognized.\r\n\r\nThe means at the disposal of Sinn Fein at present hardly seem adequate to\r\naccomplish its object. It may bring about the moral and intellectual\r\nindependence of Ireland: it may secure a certain measure of economic\r\nindependence: but to secure political independence, in face of the forces\r\nranged against it, seems impossible. But what it cannot do for itself may\r\nin the future be done for it by the moral forces of which it is a\r\nmanifestation. It may in the future be recognized by the conscience of\r\nmankind that no nation ought to exercise political domination over another\r\nnation.
