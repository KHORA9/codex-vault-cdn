PRESIDENT:\r\n\r\nIt is often charged that participants in assemblages of this character\r\nare apt to exaggerate the importance of the occasion they commemorate,\r\nand after the manner of one of our poets, sing in chorus: \"I celebrate\r\nmyself.\" Perhaps I can speak of the Wyandotte Convention and its work\r\nwithout being accused of this self-gratulation; for I was more of an\r\nobserver of its proceedings than a participant in them. I recorded what\r\nwas done, but I had no part or lot in the doing. If its work had been\r\ncrude or weak, I could not fairly have been held responsible for the\r\nfailure. As it was strong, efficient and enduring, I can felicitate you,\r\nthe survivors of those who wrought this great service for Kansas,\r\nwithout a suspicion of self-praise.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   KANSAS CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTIONS.\r\n\r\nFour Conventions framed Constitutions for this State. The first\r\nassembled at Topeka, on the 23d of October, 1855, and adjourned on the\r\n11th of November, after a session of twenty days. It was composed of\r\nforty-seven members, of whom thirty-one signed the Constitution. On the\r\n15th of December this instrument was submitted to the people for\r\nratification or rejection. Only 1,777 ballots were cast, all but 46\r\nbeing favorable. One of its sections, a provision excluding negroes and\r\nmulattoes from the State, was submitted as an independent proposition,\r\nand adopted by an affirmative vote of 1,287, to 453 against it.\r\n\r\nThe second convention was that held at Lecompton, which met on the 7th\r\nof June, 1857, and after a session of four days, adjourned until the\r\n19th of October, a final adjournment being reached on the 3d of\r\nNovember. It was composed of sixty-four members, forty-five of whom\r\nsigned the organic law it framed, and its session continued twenty days.\r\nNo direct vote on this Constitution was provided for. The Schedule\r\nordered two forms of ballot, one, the \"Constitution with Slavery,\" the\r\nother, \"Constitution with no Slavery.\" It was the old turkey and buzzard\r\nchoice. The Free State men refused to vote at the election, held on the\r\n21st of December, and only 6,712 ballots were cast, 6,147 being for\r\nSlavery and 569 against Slavery. The Free State men had, however,\r\nelected a majority of the Territorial Legislature in October, and at a\r\nspecial session of that body, held in December, a law was passed\r\nproviding for a direct vote on the Constitution. This election was held\r\non the 14th of January, 1858, resulting: against the Constitution,\r\n10,266; for, 164—the pro-Slavery men not voting. A third vote on the\r\nLecompton instrument was taken August 2d, 1858, Congress having ordered\r\nits re-submission under the terms of the English bill. Again it was\r\nrejected, the ballots in its favor being only 1,788, and those against\r\nit, 11,300.\r\n\r\nThe Leavenworth Convention met at Minneola, March 23d, 1858, and at once\r\nadjourned to Leavenworth, where it re-assembled March 25th. It was\r\ncomposed of ninety-five members, was in session only eleven days, and\r\nthe Constitution it framed was signed by eighty-three persons. This\r\ninstrument was adopted at an election held May 11th, by a very small\r\nvote, the pro-Slavery men taking no part in the contest. It was never a\r\npopular organic law, and many Free State men who supported it did so\r\nunder protest. An earnest effort was made, by the Republicans, to secure\r\nthe admission of Kansas under the Topeka Constitution, and by the\r\nDemocrats, with a few exceptions to bring the Territory in under the\r\nLecompton Constitution. But no serious or determined contest was waged,\r\nin Congress, for admission under the Leavenworth Constitution, and in\r\nless than eight months the movement in its behalf was formally\r\nabandoned.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE WYANDOTTE CONVENTION.\r\n\r\nEarly in February, 1859, the Territorial Legislature passed an act\r\nsubmitting to the people the question of calling a Constitutional\r\nConvention. This vote was taken March 28th, and resulted: For, 5,306;\r\nagainst, 1,425. On the 10th of May, 1859, the Republican party of Kansas\r\nwas organized, at Osawatomie, and at the election held on the 7th of\r\nJune, for delegates to the Wyandotte Convention, the Republican and\r\nDemocratic parties confronted each other in Kansas for the first time.\r\nThe Democrats carried the counties of Leavenworth, Doniphan, Jefferson\r\nand Jackson, and elected one of the two delegates from Johnson. The\r\nRepublicans were successful in all the other Counties voting. The total\r\nvote polled was 14,000. The Republican membership was thirty five;\r\nDemocratic, seventeen.\r\n\r\nThe Convention then chosen assembled on the 5th day of July, 1859. In\r\nits composition it was an unusual, not to say remarkable, Kansas\r\nassemblage. Apparently the chiefs of the contending parties had grown\r\nweary of Constitution making, or regarded this fourth endeavor in that\r\nline as a predestined failure, for they were conspicuous by their\r\nabsence. In the Topeka Convention nearly every prominent man of the Free\r\nState party had a seat. Gen. Lane was its President, and Charles\r\nRobinson, Martin F. Conway, Marcus J. Parrott, Wm. Y. Roberts, Geo. W.\r\nSmith, Philip C. Schuyler, C. K. Holliday, Mark W. Delahay, and many\r\nother recognized Free State leaders, were members. In the Leavenworth\r\nConvention there was a similar gathering of widely-known Free State men.\r\nConway was its President, and Lane, Roberts, Thos. Ewing, jr., Henry J.\r\nAdams, H. P. Johnson, S. N. Wood, T. Dwight Thacher, P. B. Plumb, Joel\r\nK. Goodin, A. Larzalere, W. F. M. Arny, Chas. H. Branscomb, John\r\nRitchey, and many other influential Free State chiefs or partizans, were\r\namong its members.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE MEMBERSHIP.\r\n\r\nIn the Wyandotte Convention all the noted Free State leaders were\r\nconspicuously absent. Its roll-call was made up of names generally new\r\nin Kansas affairs, and largely unknown in either the Free State or\r\npro-Slavery councils. Its President, James M. Winchell, his colleague,\r\nWm. McCullough, and John Ritchey, of Shawnee, had been members of the\r\nLeavenworth Convention; Col. Caleb May, of Atchison, and W. R. Griffith,\r\nof Bourbon, had been members of both the Topeka and the Leavenworth\r\nConventions; and Jas. M. Arthur, of Linn, had been a member of the\r\nTopeka Convention. But their prominence was largely local. On the\r\nDemocratic side, too, appeared men before unnoted in the annals of the\r\nstirring and tremendous conflict that had for years made the young\r\nTerritory the cynosure of a Continent's interest. None of the prominent\r\npro-Slavery men who sat in the Lecompton Convention or the pro-Slavery\r\nLegislatures—Calhoun, Stringfellow, Henderson, Elmore, Wilson, Carr and\r\nothers—appeared in this body.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the absence of these party leaders was a fortunate thing for the\r\nConvention and the incipient State. For in discriminating intelligence,\r\nin considerate zeal for the welfare of the people, in catholic grasp of\r\nprinciples, and in capacity for defining theories clearly and compactly,\r\nthe members of this body were not wanting. On the other hand, there were\r\nfewer jealousies and far less wrangling than would have been possible\r\nhad the envious and aspiring party leaders been present. I think it is\r\ncertain that the work was better done, done with more sobriety,\r\nsincerity, prudence and real ability, than would have resulted had the\r\nrecognized chiefs of the rival parties been on the floor of the\r\nConvention. The pioneers—the John Baptists—of the Free State cause were\r\nall at Topeka, and the Constitution they framed is disfigured by some\r\nblotches and much useless verbiage. The leaders were all at Leavenworth,\r\nwhere they schemed for precedence, and spread traps to catch one\r\nanother, and quarreled over non-essentials, and did everything but make\r\na popular Constitution. Lecompton was the last expression of a beaten,\r\ndesperate and wrong-headed, but intellectually vigorous faction, and was\r\nreally, barring the mean method of its submission, and its attempt to\r\nperpetuate Slavery, an admirable organic law.\r\n\r\nThe younger men of the Territory constituted the Convention at\r\nWyandotte. They came upon the field fresh, enthusiastic, and with a\r\nplace in the world of thought and action to conquer. They recognized the\r\nfact that they must do extremely well to secure popular favor, and they\r\nset about their task with industry, intelligence and prudence. They were\r\nnot martyrs or reformers, as many of those at Topeka were; nor jealous\r\npoliticians or factionists, as most of those at Leavenworth were. They\r\nhad no old battles to fight over again, no personal feuds to distract\r\nthem, no recollection of former defeats or victories to reverse or\r\nmaintain. They were their own prophets. They had had no experience in\r\nConstitution making, and hence did not look backward. They were not\r\nspecialists. A few had hobbies, but the vast majority had no bees\r\nbuzzing in their bonnets. A few were dogmatic, but the many were anxious\r\nto discuss, and willing to be convinced. A few were loquacious, but the\r\nmajority were thinkers and workers. Some were accomplished scholars, but\r\nthe majority were men of ordinary education, whose faculties had been\r\nsharpened and trained by the hard experience of an active and earnest\r\nlife. Many were vigorous, direct, intelligent speakers; several were\r\nreally eloquent; and a few may justly be ranked with the most versatile\r\nand brilliant men Kansas has ever numbered among her citizens.\r\n\r\nVery few were old men. Only fifteen of the fifty-two members were over\r\nforty. Over one-third were under thirty, and nearly two-thirds under\r\nthirty-five. Very few, as I have said, had previously appeared as\r\nrepresentatives of the people in any Territorial assemblage, and this\r\nwas especially true of the men whose talents, industry and force soon\r\napproved them leaders. Samuel A. Kingman had been in the Territory only\r\nabout eighteen months, and was unknown, outside of Brown county, until\r\nhe appeared at Wyandotte. Solon O. Thacher was a young lawyer of\r\nLawrence, never before prominent in public affairs. John J. Ingalls had\r\nserved, the previous winter, as Engrossing Clerk of the Territorial\r\nCouncil. Samuel A. Stinson was a young attorney, recently from Maine.\r\nWilliam C. McDowell had never been heard of outside of Leavenworth,\r\nBenjamin F. Simpson was a boyish-looking lawyer from Miami county, and\r\nJohn T. Burris had been practicing, for a year or two, before Justices'\r\ncourts in Johnson county. John P. Slough had been a member of the Ohio\r\nLegislature, but was a new comer in Kansas; and E. G. Ross was the\r\npublisher of a weekly newspaper at Topeka.\r\n\r\nOne-half of the members had been in the Territory less than two years.\r\nSix came in 1854, four in 1855, and twelve in 1856, while Mr. Forman, of\r\nDoniphan, dated his residence from 1843; Mr. Palmer, of Pottawatomie,\r\nfrom 1854, and Mr. Houston, of Riley, from 1853. Forty-one were from\r\nNorthern States, seven from the South, and four were of foreign birth,\r\nEngland, Scotland, Ireland, and Germany each contributing one. It\r\nappears singular that only one of the Western States, Indiana, was\r\nrepresented in the membership, that State furnishing six delegates.\r\nTwelve hailed from New England, Ohio contributed twelve, Pennsylvania\r\nsix, and New York four. Only eighteen belonged to the legal\r\nprofession—an unusually small number of lawyers in such a body. Sixteen\r\nwere farmers, eight merchants, three physicians, three manufacturers,\r\none a mechanic, one a printer, one a land agent, and one a surveyor. The\r\noldest member was Robert Graham, of Atchison, who was 55; the youngest,\r\nBenj. F. Simpson, of Lykins Co., (now Miami,) who was 23.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            A WORKING BODY.\r\n\r\nIt was a working body, from the first hour of its session until the\r\nlast. There is a tradition that the Continental Congress which\r\npromulgated the Declaration of Independence was materially hastened in\r\nits deliberations over that immortal document by swarms of flies that\r\ninvaded the hall where it sat, and made the life of its members a\r\nburden. Perhaps the intense heat of the rough-plastered room where the\r\nConvention met, or the knowledge that Territorial scrip would be\r\nreceived by importunate landlords only at a usurious discount, had\r\nsomething to do with urging dispatch in business. But certainly the\r\nConvention went to work with an energy and industry I have never seen\r\nparalleled in a Kansas deliberative body since that time. It perfected\r\nits organization, adopted rules for its government, discussed the best\r\nmode of procedure in framing a Constitution, and appointed a Committee\r\nto report upon that subject, during the first day's session; all the\r\nstanding Committees were announced on the third day; and by the close of\r\nthe fifth day it had disposed of two very troublesome contested election\r\ncases, decided that the Ohio Constitution should be the model for that\r\nof Kansas, perfected arrangements for reporting and printing its\r\ndebates, and instructed its Committees upon a number of disputed\r\nquestions. The vote on selecting a model for the Constitution was, on\r\nthe second ballot: for the Ohio Constitution, 25 votes; Indiana, 23; and\r\nKentucky, 1. So our Kansas Constitution was modeled after that of\r\nOhio—something, I think, as the farmer's new house was designed after\r\nhis old one; it was built upon the old site.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE COMMITTEES.\r\n\r\nThe Chairmanships of the different Committees were assigned as follows:\r\nPreamble and Bill of Rights—Wm. Hutchinson, of Lawrence. Executive\r\nDepartment—John P. Greer, of Shawnee. Legislative Department—Solon O.\r\nThacher, of Lawrence. Judicial Department—Samuel A. Kingman, of Brown\r\nCo. Military—James G. Blunt, of Anderson Co. Electors and Elections—P.\r\nH. Townsend, of Douglas. Schedule—John T. Burris, of Johnson.\r\nApportionment—H. D. Preston, of Shawnee. Corporations and Banking—Robert\r\nGraham, of Atchison. Education and Public Institutions—W. R. Griffith,\r\nof Bourbon Co. County and Township Organizations—John Ritchey, of\r\nTopeka. Ordinance and Public Debt—James Blood, of Lawrence. Finance and\r\nTaxation—Benj. F. Simpson, of Lykins. Amendments and Miscellaneous—S. D.\r\nHouston, of Riley Co. Federal Relations—T. S. Wright, of Nemaha Co.\r\nPhraseology and Arrangements—John J. Ingalls, of Atchison.\r\n\r\nI have studied the composition of these Committees with some interest,\r\nreviewing the work of their members in the Convention, and recalling\r\ntheir subsequent careers. And it appears to me that in making them up,\r\nPresident Winchell exhibited phenomenally quick and accurate judgment of\r\nmen. He was, indeed, one of the best presiding officers I have ever\r\nknown. His imperturbable coolness, never for an instant ruffled by the\r\nmost sudden and passionate outbreaks of excitement in the Convention;\r\nhis mastery of all the niceties of parliamentary law; his uniform\r\ncourtesy and tact; his promptness and clearness in stating his\r\ndecisions; and above all, the mingled grace and kindness and firmness\r\nwith which he announced to an indignant member an adverse decision, were\r\nreally wonderful. But what shall be said of that still more wonderful\r\nprescience with which he made up the Committees? What induced this calm,\r\ngrey-eyed, observing little man, whose brass-buttoned blue coat was\r\nfirst seen by two-thirds of the Convention on the morning of the 5th of\r\nJuly—what impelled him, within twenty-four hours, to select an obscure,\r\ndull-looking, shock-headed country doctor as Chairman of the Military\r\nCommittee, and thus name in connection with military affairs, for the\r\nfirst time, the only Kansas soldier who reached a full Major\r\nGeneralship? How did he happen to pass by half a dozen more widely known\r\nlawyers, and appoint as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, a man who,\r\nduring more than fifteen years thereafter, occupied a place on the\r\nSupreme Bench of the State, for the greater portion of this time as the\r\nChief Justice? How came he to recognize so quickly, in the Engrossing\r\nClerk of the Territorial Legislature, the ripest scholar and the fittest\r\nman in the body for the Chairmanship of the Committee to which every\r\narticle of the Constitution was referred for final revision and\r\namendment? In the youngest and most boyish-looking member he found the\r\nman who was to form, for this State, a code of Finance and Taxation\r\nwhose clear directions and wholesome restrictions have guarded Kansas\r\nagainst the wasteful extravagance of Legislatures and the curse of a\r\nburdensome public debt, during all the tempting and perilous affairs of\r\nits first quarter of a century. And he named, as head of the Committee\r\non Education, the first State Superintendent of Public Instruction. All\r\nof his appointments were made with rare judgment, but those mentioned\r\nappear notably discerning.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           PROGRESS OF WORK.\r\n\r\nOn the sixth day a resolution favoring biennial sessions of the\r\nLegislature—adopted sixteen years afterward—was submitted and referred.\r\nThe first of a long series of resolutions or proposed sections of the\r\nConstitution, prohibiting the settlement of negroes or mulattoes within\r\nthe limits of the State, was also introduced. This question, with others\r\nof a kindred nature, such as propositions to prohibit colored children\r\nattending the schools, or to exclude them from the University, or to\r\nforbid the appropriation of any funds for their education, and last, and\r\nmeanest of all, to deny to negroes the shelter of county poor houses\r\nwhen poor and helpless, was voted upon again and again, first in one\r\nform and then in another, and to the enduring honor of the majority,\r\nalways defeated. It seems singular, in this day and generation, that\r\nsuch theories found persistent and earnest advocates. But it should be\r\nremembered that all this happened before the war, when slavery was still\r\nan \"institution\" in nearly half the States of the Union. The pro-Slavery\r\nparty was, of course, solidly in favor of excluding free negroes from\r\nthe State, and less than four years prior to the meeting of the\r\nConvention, the Free State party, in voting on the Topeka Constitution,\r\nhad given a decided majority in favor of such exclusion. It therefore\r\nrequired genuine courage and principle to go upon record against each\r\nand every proposition of this character. For very few members who so\r\nvoted felt absolutely certain of the endorsement of their constituents.\r\n\r\nThe first Article of the Constitution reported, that on Corporations and\r\nBanks, was submitted on the sixth day and considered. It was stated, by\r\nthe President, that many other Committees had their reports in the hands\r\nof the printer, and during the next few days they began to come in very\r\nrapidly. The Convention, to expedite work, adopted a resolution\r\nrequiring all Committees to report on or before Saturday, the eleventh\r\nday of the session.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE BOUNDARIES OF THE STATE.\r\n\r\nOn the seventh day the annexation of that portion of Nebraska lying\r\nsouth of the Platte river, was formally considered. The then organized\r\nNebraska counties included in that section of our sister State had\r\nelected delegates to the Convention, who were present earnestly\r\nadvocating annexation. This proposition was discussed during several\r\ndays, and the debates took a wide range. The Nebraska delegates were\r\nadmitted to seats as honorary members, with the privilege of speaking on\r\nthis subject. The final determination, however, was to preserve the\r\noriginal Northern line. Two influences induced this decision, one\r\npolitical, the other local and material. Many Republicans feared that\r\nthe South Platte Country was, or would be likely to become, Democratic.\r\nLawrence and Topeka both aspired to be the State Capital, and their\r\ninfluence was against annexation, because they feared it would throw the\r\ncenter of population far north of the Kaw.\r\n\r\nThe Preamble and Bill of Rights was reported on the tenth day, and\r\nopened the whole question of the State's boundaries. The Committee\r\nproposed the twenty-third meridian as the western line, and the fortieth\r\nparallel as the line on the north. This would have excluded about ninety\r\nmiles of territory within the present limits of the State. The\r\nCommittee's recommendation was, however, adopted, and stood as the\r\ndetermination of the Convention until the day before the final\r\nadjournment, when Col. May, of Atchison, secured a reconsideration, and\r\non his motion the twenty-fifth parallel was substituted for the\r\ntwenty-third. The northern boundary question was finally settled on the\r\nfifteenth day, when, by a vote of 19 ayes to 29 nays, the Convention\r\nrefused to memorialize Congress to include the South Platte country\r\nwithin the limits of Kansas.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     FEATURES OF THE CONSTITUTION.\r\n\r\nOn the seventh day the Legislative and Judicial Committees reported. The\r\nLegislative article was considered next day. The Committee proposed that\r\nbills might originate in either House, but Mr. Winchell submitted a\r\nnovel amendment, which required all laws to originate in the House of\r\nRepresentatives. This was adopted, notwithstanding the vigorous\r\nopposition of Mr. Thacher, the Chairman of the Committee, by a vote of\r\n37 to 13. It survived the admission of the State only three years, being\r\namended in 1864.\r\n\r\nOn the eighth day the Militia article was adopted; on the ninth day the\r\nJudicial article was perfected, and the article on Education and Public\r\nInstitutions reported and discussed; and on the tenth day the Committees\r\non County and Township Organizations, and Schedule, reported. The\r\ndeathless pertinacity of a \"claim\" is illustrated by a petition\r\npresented that day, from one Samuel A. Lowe, a clerk of the so-called\r\n\"Bogus Legislature,\" who wanted pay for certain work he alleged he had\r\nperformed. Only a year ago Mr. Lowe presented the same claim to\r\nCongress, and it was, I believe allowed by the House. But the Kansas\r\nSenators made such determined war on it that Mr Lowe can still sing, \"a\r\nclaim to keep I have.\"\r\n\r\nI have mentioned the fact that Mr Winchell was the author of the section\r\nproviding that all bills should originate in the House. It should be\r\nstated that Mr. Ingalls was the author of the provision that \"in actions\r\nfor libel, the truth may be given in evidence to the jury, and if it\r\nshall appear that the alleged libelous matter was published for\r\njustifiable ends, the accused shall be acquitted.\" Another original\r\nprovision of the Constitution is the Homestead section. This was first\r\nproposed by Mr. Foster, of Leavenworth county, on the sixth day of the\r\nsession, and reported by the Committee on Miscellaneous and Amendments,\r\non the thirteenth day. No other feature of the Constitution, perhaps,\r\nelicited more animated and earnest debate. It was discussed for several\r\ndays; amended, referred, and again submitted. As originally reported, it\r\nprovided for the exemption of \"a homestead of 160 acres of land, or a\r\nhouse and lot not exceeding $2,000 in value, or real, personal and mixed\r\nproperty not exceeding $2,000, to any family.\" This was adopted by a\r\nvote of 28 ayes to 16 nays. Two days later the vote was reconsidered,\r\nand President Winchell proposed the wording finally adopted: \"A\r\nhomestead of 160 acres of farming land, or of one acre within the limits\r\nof an incorporated town or city, occupied as a residence by the family\r\nof the owner, together with all the improvements on the same, shall be\r\nexempted from forced sale under any process of law, and shall not be\r\nalienated without the joint consent of husband and wife, where the\r\nrelation exists.\" Thus perfected, it was adopted by a vote of 33 to 7.\r\n\r\nI thought at the time, however, and a review of the proceedings and\r\ndebates has confirmed my impression that favorable action on this\r\nprovision was due to the earnest and eloquent advocacy of Judge Kingman,\r\nwho was its most zealous, logical and courageous supporter. The\r\nhomestead clause of the Kansas Constitution has been severely\r\ncriticised, but I believe the people of the State generally regard it as\r\na most beneficent provision of their organic law. For nearly a quarter\r\nof a century it has been maintained, and it still stands, as Judge\r\nKingman said it would, guarding \"the home, the hearthstone, the fireside\r\naround which a man may gather his family with the certainty of assurance\r\nthat neither the hand of the law, nor any, nor all of the uncertainties\r\nof life, can eject them from the possession of it.\"\r\n\r\nThe Finance and Taxation and the Executive articles were adopted on the\r\nfourteenth day, and the Miscellaneous article considered. This\r\noriginally provided for the election of a Public Printer, but that\r\nsection was stricken out, after a vigorous protest by Messrs. Ross and\r\nIngalls. Nine years later their idea was endorsed, by the adoption of an\r\namendment creating the office of State Printer.\r\n\r\nOn the seventeenth day the temporary Capital was located at Topeka, the\r\nsecond ballot resulting: for Topeka, 29; for Lawrence, 14; for Atchison,\r\n6.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE FIRST \"PROHIBITION AMENDMENT.\"\r\n\r\nOn the same day a proposition was made, by Mr. Preston, of Shawnee Co.,\r\nto amend the Miscellaneous article by adding the following section:\r\n\r\n\"Sec. —. The Legislature shall have power to regulate or prohibit the\r\nsale of alcoholic liquors, except for mechanical and medicinal\r\npurposes.\"\r\n\r\nA motion made to lay this amendment on the table, was defeated, by a\r\nvote of 18 ayes to 31 nays. But the anxiety of the members to exclude\r\nfrom the Constitution any provision that might render its adoption\r\ndoubtful, or prevent the admission of the State, finally prevailed, and\r\nafter a full interchange of views, Mr. Preston withdrew his amendment.\r\nThere is, it is said, nothing new under the sun. Those who imagine that\r\nthe prohibition amendment adopted in 1880 was a new departure in\r\nConstitution making, have never examined the records of the Wyandotte\r\nConvention.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE LAST OF SLAVERY IN KANSAS.\r\n\r\nOn the nineteenth day occurred the last struggle over the Slavery\r\nquestion in Kansas. Sec. 6 of the Bill of Rights, prohibiting Slavery or\r\ninvoluntary servitude, came up for adoption, and it was moved to add a\r\nproviso suspending the operation of this section for the period of\r\ntwelve months after the admission of the State. This proviso received\r\neleven votes, and twenty-eight were recorded against it. A most exciting\r\ndiscussion occurred, on the same day, over the apportionment article,\r\nwhich the Democrats denounced as a \"gerrymander.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE LAST DAYS.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Convention was practically completed on the twenty-first\r\nday. The various articles had each been considered and adopted, first in\r\nCommittee of the whole, then in Convention, then referred to the\r\nCommittee on Phraseology and Arrangement, and, after report of that\r\nCommittee, again considered by sections and adopted. But so anxious were\r\nthe members that every word used should be the right word, expressing\r\nthe idea intended most clearly and directly, that when the reading of\r\nthe completed Constitution was finished, on the morning of the 21st day,\r\nit was decided to refer it to a special committee, consisting of Messrs.\r\nIngalls, Winchell, Ross and Slough, for further revision and\r\nverification. This Committee reported the same afternoon, and again the\r\nConstitution was read by sections, for final revision, with the same\r\npainstaking carefulness and attention to the minutest details. All that\r\nafternoon, and all the next day, with brief interruptions for action on\r\nother closing work, this revision went on, and it was five o'clock in\r\nthe afternoon of the 29th before the last section was perfected. Then\r\noccurred one of the most dramatic scenes of the Convention. Mr.\r\nHutchinson submitted a resolution declaring that \"we do now adopt and\r\nproceed to sign the Constitution.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                           A SPIRITED DEBATE.\r\n\r\nAt once Mr. Slough addressed the Chair, and after warmly eulogizing the\r\ngeneral features of the Constitution, pronouncing it \"a model\r\ninstrument,\" he formally announced that political objections impelled\r\nhimself and his Democratic associates to decline attaching their\r\nsignatures to it. These objections he stated at length. They were,\r\nbriefly: the curtailment of the boundaries of the State; the large\r\nLegislative body provided for; the exclusion of Indians made citizens of\r\nthe United States, from the privilege of voting; the registry of voters\r\nat the election on the Constitution; the refusal to exclude free negroes\r\nfrom the State; and the apportionment.\r\n\r\nThis action of the Democratic members had been foreshadowed for several\r\ndays, but it was, nevertheless, something of a surprise. The Republicans\r\nunderstood that several of the Democrats had earnestly opposed such a\r\ncourse, and hoped that some of them would be governed by their own\r\nconvictions, rather than by the mandate of their caucus. For a few\r\nmoments after Mr. Slough concluded, the Convention sat, hushed and\r\nexpectant. But no other Democratic member rose. It was evident that the\r\ncaucus ruled. Then Judge Thacher, the President _pro tem._, addressed\r\nthe Chair, and in a speech of remarkable vigor and eloquence, accepted\r\nthe gauge of battle thrown down. \"Upon this Constitution,\" he declared,\r\n\"we will meet our opponents in the popular arena. It is a better, a\r\nnobler issue than even the old Free State issue. They have thrown down\r\nthe gauntlet; we joyfully take it up.\" He then proceeded to defend, with\r\ngreat earnestness and power, the features of the Constitution objected\r\nto by Mr. Slough. \"The members of the Convention,\" he asserted, \"have\r\nperfected a work that will be enduring.\" The Constitution, he affirmed,\r\nwould \"commend itself to the true and good everywhere, because through\r\nevery line and syllable there glows the generous sunshine of liberty.\"\r\nIt was and should be, he declared:\r\n\r\n        \"Like some tall cliff, that lifts its awful form,\r\n        Swells from the vale, and midway leaves the storm;\r\n        Though round its breast the rolling clouds shall spread,\r\n        Eternal sunshine settles on its head.\"\r\n\r\nRead in the light of subsequent history, these declarations appear\r\nalmost prophetic.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       SIGNING THE CONSTITUTION.\r\n\r\nThe twilight shadows were gathering about Wyandotte when this debate\r\nclosed, and the Convention proceeded to vote on Mr. Hutchinson's\r\nresolution, which was adopted by 34 ayes to 13 nays—one Republican and\r\nfour Democrats being absent. The roll was then called, and the\r\nConstitution was signed by all the Republican members except one, Mr.\r\nWright, of Nemaha, who was absent, sick. The work of the Convention was\r\ncompleted, and after voting thanks to its officers, it adjourned without\r\ndate.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             TWO MISTAKES.\r\n\r\nEach party, I think, was guilty of one blunder it afterwards seriously\r\nregretted—the Republicans in refusing to include the South Platte\r\ncountry within the boundaries of Kansas; the Democrats in refusing to\r\nsign the Constitution they had labored diligently to perfect. I speak of\r\nwhat I consider the great mistake of the Republicans with all the more\r\nfrankness because I was, at the time, in hearty sympathy with their\r\naction; but I feel confident that no Republican member is living to-day\r\nwho does not deplore that decision. And I am equally confident that\r\nwithin a brief time after the Convention adjourned, there were few\r\nDemocratic members who did not seriously regret their refusal to sign\r\nthe Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         \"ADDED TO THE STARS.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of October, 1859, the Constitution was submitted to the\r\npeople for ratification or rejection, and, for the first time in the\r\nhistory of Kansas, all parties cast a full, free and unintimidated vote.\r\nThe Republicans favored, and the Democrats generally opposed its\r\nadoption. Nearly 16,000 ballots were polled, of which 10,421 were for,\r\nand 5,530 against the Constitution. The Homestead clause, submitted as\r\nan independent proposition, was ratified by a vote of 8,788 for, to\r\n4,772 against it. Every county in the territory except two, Johnson and\r\nMorris, gave a majority for the Constitution.\r\n\r\nTwo months later, December 6th, State and County officers and members of\r\nthe Legislature were elected, and the people of Kansas, having exhausted\r\ntheir authority in State building, patiently awaited the action of\r\nCongress. On the 11th of April, 1860, the House of Representatives\r\nvoted, 134 to 73, to admit Kansas as a State, under the Wyandotte\r\nConstitution. Twice, during the next eight months, the Senate defeated\r\nmotions to consider the Kansas bill, but on the 21st of January, 1861,\r\nseveral Southern Senators having seceded, Mr. Seward \"took a pinch of\r\nsnuff\" and called it up again. It passed by a vote of 36 to 16, and on\r\nthe 29th of the same month President Buchanan approved it. Thus young\r\nKansas, through many difficulties and turmoils, was \"added to the\r\nStars.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                       AN ENDURING CONSTITUTION.\r\n\r\nDuring nearly twenty-two of the most eventful and exciting years of\r\nAmerican history, the Constitution thus framed and ratified has defined\r\nthe powers and regulated the duties of the government of Kansas. Three\r\nLegislatures have voted down propositions to call a new Constitutional\r\nConvention. Twelve or fifteen amendments have been submitted, but only\r\neight have been approved by the people. Finally, in 1880, the\r\nLegislature voted to submit a proposal for a new Convention, and at the\r\nregular election held in November of that year, this ballot was taken.\r\nThe result was an endorsement of the old Wyandotte Constitution by a\r\nmajority far more emphatic and overwhelming than that by which it was\r\noriginally adopted, the vote standing 22,870 for, and 146,279 against\r\nthe proposed Convention, or nearly seven to one.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether the organic law of any other State in the Union\r\nhas more successfully survived the mutations of time and inconstant\r\npublic sentiment, and the no less fluctuating necessities of a swiftly\r\ndeveloping Commonwealth. Of its seventeen articles, only four, and of\r\nits one hundred and seventy-eight sections, only eight, have ever been\r\namended. And of the eight amendments adopted, only five have revoked or\r\nmodified the principles or policy originally formulated, the others\r\nbeing changes demanded by the growth of the State, or by the events of\r\nthe civil war. The first amendment, ratified in 1861, provides that no\r\nbanking institution shall issue circulating notes of a less denomination\r\nthan $1—the original limitation being $5. In 1864 the provision\r\nrequiring all bills to originate in the House of Representatives, was\r\nrepealed; and a section intended to prevent U. S. soldiers from voting,\r\nbut which was so worded that it deprived our volunteers of that right,\r\nwas also repealed. In 1867 an amendment was adopted disfranchising all\r\npersons who aided the \"Lost Cause,\" or who were dishonorably discharged\r\nfrom the army of the United States, or who had defrauded the United\r\nStates or any State during the war. In 1868 the State Printer amendment\r\nwas ratified. In 1873 the number of Senators and Representatives,\r\noriginally limited to 33 and 100, respectively, was increased to 40 and\r\n125. In 1875 three propositions, each having in view biennial instead of\r\nannual sessions of the Legislature, were adopted. And in 1880 the\r\nProhibition amendment was ratified. These are all the changes that have\r\nbeen made in our organic law during nearly a quarter of a century.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         PARTING AT WYANDOTTE.\r\n\r\nIt would violate the proprieties of such an occasion to comment on the\r\npersonal feuds or partisan broils which once or twice marred the general\r\nharmony and orderly progress of the proceedings. These were very few,\r\nindeed, and none of them, I think, outlasted the Convention. The members\r\nparted, when the final adjournment came, with mutual respect and good\r\nwill, and the friendships formed during the session have been unusually\r\nwarm and enduring.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SUBSEQUENT HISTORY.\r\n\r\nIt seems fitting that, in concluding this sketch of the Convention and\r\nits labors, I should briefly narrate the subsequent history of its\r\nmembers. It was a small company, that which parted here twenty-three\r\nyears ago to-day, and it was made up, as I have said, largely of young\r\nand vigorous men. But when this reunion was first suggested, and I came\r\nto look over the familiar names I had so often called during the long,\r\nhot days of that far away July, it was painful to note the havoc death\r\nhad made. It impressed me something as did a roll-call I once witnessed,\r\nin the red glare of bivouac fires after one of the great battles of the\r\nwar, when surviving comrades answered \"killed,\" or \"wounded,\" to\r\none-half the names of a regiment. Ten of the fifty-two members composing\r\nthe Convention I have not heard of for many years. Of the remaining\r\nforty-two, twenty rest quietly in\r\n\r\n                                —\"The reconciling grave,\r\n              Where all alike lie down in peace together.\"\r\n\r\nThe largest delegation was that from Leavenworth county, and only one of\r\nthe ten gentlemen comprising it, R. C. Foster, certainly survives. Rare\r\nSam Stinson, whose genial wit and brilliant accomplishments won all\r\nhearts, was elected Attorney General in 1861, by a unanimous vote, and\r\ndied in his old Maine home, in February, 1866. William C. McDowell was\r\nchosen Judge of the First Judicial District at the first election under\r\nthe Constitution; served four years; and was killed by a fall from an\r\nomnibus in St. Louis, July 16, 1866. John P. Slough removed to Colorado,\r\nwas Colonel of a regiment raised in that State, and later a Brigadier\r\nGeneral; was appointed, after the war, Chief Justice of New Mexico, and\r\nwas killed at Santa Fe. Samuel Hipple removed to Atchison county; served\r\nas a Quartermaster during the war; was elected State Senator in 1867;\r\nand died in January, 1876. William Perry removed to Colorado, where he\r\ndied. P. S. Parks returned to Indiana, and engaged in journalism and the\r\nlaw until his death, three years ago. Fred. Brown died in St. Joseph,\r\nMo., and John Wright at his home in Leavenworth county. Robert Graham,\r\nof Atchison county, the oldest member, died in 1868. Three of the five\r\nmembers from Doniphan county, Robert J. Porter, Benjamin Wrigley and\r\nJohn Stairwalt, are dead. The members from Linn, James M. Arthur and\r\nJosiah Lamb, are both dead, as are also N. C. Blood, of Douglas, and T.\r\nS. Wright, of Nemaha. W. R. Griffith, of Bourbon, was elected the first\r\nState Superintendent of Public Instruction, and died, February 12th,\r\n1862, before the completion of his term. James G. Blunt, of Anderson,\r\nwho became a Major General during the war, and won renown as a brave and\r\nskillful soldier, died, in Washington, a year or more ago. James Hanway,\r\nof Franklin, after a long life of usefulness, died at his old home, only\r\na brief while ago. President James M. Winchell returned to New York\r\nshortly after the outbreak of the rebellion, and resumed his connection\r\nwith the _Times_, first as war correspondent and afterwards as an\r\neditorial writer. Until his death, a few years since, he was employed\r\nupon that great journal.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           SURVIVING MEMBERS.\r\n\r\nOf the surviving members, many have attained the highest distinctions of\r\nthe State, and all, I believe are useful and honored citizens. At the\r\nfirst election under the Constitution, Samuel A. Kingman was chosen as\r\nAssociate Justice of the Supreme Court; in 1866 he was elected Chief\r\nJustice, and re-elected in 1872. Benj. F. Simpson was elected the first\r\nAttorney General of the State, but resigned the position to enter the\r\narmy, in which he served throughout the war. He has since been Speaker\r\nof the House of Representatives, several times a State Senator, and is\r\nnow serving his second term as U. S. Marshal. Solon O. Thacher was\r\nchosen District Judge at the first election under the Constitution, has\r\nsince occupied many positions of honor and responsibility, and is a\r\nmember of the present State Senate. J. C. Burnett, S. D. Houston and S.\r\nE. Hoffman were members of the first State Senate, and Geo. H. Lillie\r\nwas a member of the first House of Representatives. E. G. Ross was\r\nappointed United States Senator in 1866, and elected in 1867, serving\r\nuntil 1871. John J. Ingalls was chosen as State Senator in 1861; was\r\nelected United States Senator in 1873, and re-elected in 1879, and is\r\nstill occupying that distinguished place. John T. Burris was Lieut. Col.\r\nof the 10th Kansas, and subsequently District Judge. Wm. P. Dutton,\r\nJames Blood, L. R. Palmer, John P. Greer and John Ritchey have filled\r\nmany positions of local trust and prominence, with credit and\r\nusefulness. R. C. Foster and John W. Forman are residing in Texas;\r\nWilliam Hutchinson lives in Washington; and C. B. McClellan, E. Moore\r\nand E. M. Hubbard are still prominent and honored citizens of the\r\ncounties they represented. My old friend, Col. Caleb May, sole surviving\r\nmember of the three Free State Constitutional Conventions, lives in\r\nMontgomery Co. If Dean Swift was right in saying that \"whoever could\r\nmake two ears of corn, or two blades of grass, to grow on a spot of\r\nground where one grew before, would deserve better of mankind, and do\r\nmore essential service to his country, than the whole race of\r\npoliticians,\" what honor is due this sturdy Kansas farmer, who, during a\r\nresidence of twenty-eight years in the State, has never—not even in the\r\ndisastrous seasons of 1860 and 1874—failed to raise a good crop. Even\r\nthe heroic service he rendered the cause of Freedom during the darkest\r\ndays of the struggle in Kansas, was less valuable to the State than this\r\npractical and triumphant vindication of its soil and climate.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            \"LOST TO SIGHT.\"\r\n\r\nStalwart, quiet Wm. McCullough I have not heard of for many years. John\r\nA. Middleton, of Marshall Co., was a soldier in the 7th Kansas, removed\r\nto Montana in 1864, and I have learned nothing of him since. H. D.\r\nPreston, of Shawnee; R. L. Williams, P. H. Townsend and Ed. Stokes, of\r\nDouglas; Allen Crocker, of Woodson; A. D. McCune, of Leavenworth; J. H.\r\nSignor, of Allen, and J. T. Barton, of Johnson, have all disappeared and\r\nleft no sign. I know not whether they are living or dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE OFFICERS.\r\n\r\nOf the officers of the Convention, queer old George Warren,\r\nSergeant-at-arms of nearly all the early Kansas Legislatures and\r\nConventions, died many years ago. Ed. S. Nash, the Journal Clerk, was\r\nAdjutant of the 1st Kansas, and died, some years since, in Chicago.\r\nRobt. St. Clair Graham, one of the Enrolling Clerks, was elected Judge\r\nof the Second Judicial District in 1866, and died in 1880. Richard J.\r\nHinton, also an Enrolling Clerk, is the editor of the Washington (D. C.)\r\n_Gazette_, and a widely known journalist. Werter R. Davis, the Chaplain,\r\nwas a member of the first State Legislature; was Chaplain of the 12th\r\nand Colonel of the 16th Kansas regiments during the war; and is one of\r\nthe most prominent clergymen of his denomination in the State. S. D.\r\nMcDonald, printer to the Convention, is still engaged in journalism. J.\r\nM. Funk, the door-keeper, and J. L. Blanchard, the Assistant Secretary,\r\nI have not heard from or of for many years.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nI wish I could sketch more in detail the work and history of the members\r\nof the Convention. But this paper is, I know, already too long. I have\r\ntried to tell how our Constitution was made. I could not narrate, within\r\nreasonable limits,\r\n\r\n               \"What workman wrought its ribs of steel,\r\n                 Who made each mast, and sail, and rope,\r\n               What anvils rang, what hammers beat,\r\n               In what a forge and what a heat\r\n                 Were shaped the anchors of its hope.\"\r\n\r\nIt is enough to say that the work has proved strong and enduring.\r\nThrough the groping inexperience of our State's childhood and the still\r\nmore perilous ambitions of its youth, through the storm of civil war and\r\nthe calm of prosperous peace, the Wyandotte Convention has justified the\r\nconfident hopes of its early friends. The most marvelous changes have\r\nbeen wrought in this country since it was framed. The huge brick\r\nbuilding in which the Convention held its sessions, long ago crumbled\r\nand fell. The distracted, dependent and turbulent Territory has grown to\r\nbe a peaceful, powerful and prosperous State. Its hundred thousand\r\npeople have multiplied to a million. Upon its vast and solitary\r\nprairies, where then bloomed a wild and unprofitable vegetation,\r\n\"wherewith the mower filleth not his hand, nor he that bindeth sheaves\r\nhis bosom,\" miles of green meadows now glisten with morning dew, and\r\nthousands of golden wheat fields shimmer in the noonday sun, and\r\nmillions of acres of tasseling corn, rustling in the sweet twilight air,\r\ntell of harvests so bountiful that they would feed a continent. Every\r\nquiet valley and prairie swell is dotted with pleasant homes, where\r\nhappy children laugh and play and men and women go their busy ways in\r\nprosperous content. Eager learners throng eight thousand school houses.\r\nChurch bells ring in nearly every county from the Missouri to the\r\nColorado line. More than four thousand miles of railway bind town and\r\ncountry, factory and farm and store, into one community. And over all\r\nthe institutions and activities of this great, intelligent and orderly\r\nCommonwealth, broods the genius and spirit of the Wyandotte Convention.\r\nUnder its ample authority and direction, just and generous laws have\r\nmaintained the rights of citizenship, given protection to labor and\r\nproperty, stimulated enterprise, multiplied industries, opened to every\r\nchild and youth the door of school and college, encouraged morality,\r\nfostered temperance, protected the weak, restrained the strong, and\r\nsternly punished outbreaking crime. And still the sunshine of popular\r\nconfidence and favor falls upon the Constitution. It has outlived half\r\nof its framers, and when, a quarter of a century hence, the last\r\nsurviving member of the Convention awaits the inevitable hour, the\r\nWyandotte Constitution may yet be the chart and compass ordering and\r\nguiding the destinies of a State whose imperial manhood is foreshadowed\r\nby its stalwart and stately youth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n 1.
