Cross-Reference List of Geographic Names\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=====================================================================\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes and Definitions\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to the updating of information, the following\r\nchanges have been made in this edition of The World\r\nFactbook. The name Wake Island has been officially changed\r\nto Wake Atoll. The Historical perspective and Current issues\r\nentries in the Introduction category have been combined into\r\na new Background entry. It appears in only a few country\r\nprofiles at this time. There are new entries on Population\r\nbelow poverty line, Household income or consumption by\r\npercentage share, Electricity--production by source (fossil\r\nfuel, hydro, nuclear, other), Electricity--exports, and\r\nElectricity--imports. A new reference map of Kosovo has been\r\nincluded and terrain has been added to most of the reference\r\nmaps.\r\n\r\nAbbreviations: This information is included in Appendix A:\r\nAbbreviations, which includes all abbreviations and acronyms\r\nused in the Factbook, with their expansions.\r\n\r\nAdministrative divisions: This entry generally gives the\r\nnumbers, designatory terms, and first-order administrative\r\ndivisions as approved by the US Board on Geographic Names\r\n(BGN). Changes that have been reported but not yet acted on\r\nby BGN are noted.\r\n\r\nAge structure: This entry provides the distribution of the\r\npopulation according to age. Information is included by sex\r\nand age group (0-14 years, 15-64 years, 65 years and over).\r\nThe age structure of a population affects a nation's key\r\nsocioeconomic issues. Countries with young populations (high\r\npercentage under age 15) need to invest more in schools,\r\nwhile countries with older populations (high percentage ages\r\n65 and over) need to invest more in the health sector. The\r\nage structure can also be used to help predict potential\r\npolitical issues. For example, the rapid growth of a young\r\nadult population unable to find employment can lead to\r\nunrest.\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: This entry is a rank ordering of major\r\ncrops and products starting with the most important.\r\n\r\nAirports: This entry gives the total number of airports. The\r\nrunway(s) may be paved (concrete or asphalt surfaces) or\r\nunpaved (grass, dirt, sand, or gravel surfaces), but must be\r\nusable. Not all airports have facilities for refueling,\r\nmaintenance, or air traffic control.\r\n\r\nAirports--with paved runways: This entry gives the total\r\nnumber of airports with paved runways (concrete or asphalt\r\nsurfaces). For airports with more than one runway, only the\r\nlongest runway is included according to the following five\r\ngroups --(1) over 3,047 m, (2) 2,438 to 3,047 m, (3) 1,524 to\r\n2,437 m, (4) 914 to 1,523 m, and (5) under 914 m. Only\r\nairports with usable runways are included in this listing.\r\nNot all airports have facilities for refueling, maintenance,\r\nor air traffic control.\r\n\r\nAirports--with unpaved runways: This entry gives the total\r\nnumber of airports with unpaved runways (grass, dirt, sand,\r\nor gravel surfaces). For airports with more than one runway,\r\nonly the longest runway is included according to the\r\nfollowing five groups--(1) over 3,047 m, (2) 2,438 to 3,047\r\nm, (3) 1,524 to 2,437 m, (4) 914 to 1,523 m, and (5) under\r\n914 m. Only airports with usable runways are included in\r\nthis listing. Not all airports have facilities for\r\nrefueling, maintenance, or air traffic control.\r\n\r\nAppendixes: This section includes Factbook-related material\r\nby topic.\r\n\r\nArea: This entry includes three subfields. Total area is the\r\nsum of all land and water areas delimited by international\r\nboundaries and/or coastlines. Land area is the aggregate of\r\nall surfaces delimited by international boundaries and/or\r\ncoastlines, excluding inland water bodies (lakes,\r\nreservoirs, rivers). Water area is the sum of all water\r\nsurfaces delimited by international boundaries and/or\r\ncoastlines, including inland water bodies (lakes,\r\nreservoirs, rivers).\r\n\r\nArea--comparative: This entry provides an area comparison\r\nbased on total area equivalents. Most entities are compared\r\nwith the entire US or one of the 50 states based on area\r\nmeasurements (1990 revised) provided by the US Bureau of the\r\nCensus. The smaller entities are compared with Washington,\r\nDC (178 sq km, 69 sq mi) or The Mall in Washington, DC (0.59\r\nsq km, 0.23 sq mi, 146 acres).\r\n\r\nBackground: This entry usually highlights major historic\r\nevents, current issues, and may include a statement about\r\none or two key future trends. This entry appears for only a\r\nfew countries at the present time, but will be added to all\r\ncountries in the future.\r\n\r\nBirth rate: This entry gives the average annual number of\r\nbirths during a year per 1,000 persons in the population at\r\nmidyear; also known as crude birth rate. The birth rate is\r\nusually the dominant factor in determining the rate of\r\npopulation growth. It depends on both the level of fertility\r\nand the age structure of the population.\r\n\r\nBudget: This entry includes revenues, total expenditures,\r\nand capital expenditures. These figures are calculated on an\r\nexchange rate basis, i.e., not in purchasing power parity\r\n(PPP) terms.\r\n\r\nCapital: This entry gives the location of the seat of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nClimate: This entry includes a brief description of typical\r\nweather regimes throughout the year.\r\n\r\nCoastline: This entry gives the total length of the boundary\r\nbetween the land area (including islands) and the sea.\r\n\r\nCommunications: This category deals with the means of\r\nexchanging information and includes the telephone, radio,\r\nand television entries.\r\n\r\nCommunications--note: This entry includes miscellaneous\r\ncommunications information of significance not included\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nConstitution: This entry includes the dates of adoption,\r\nrevisions, and major amendments.\r\n\r\nCountry map: Most versions of the Factbook provide a country\r\nmap in color. The maps were produced from the best\r\ninformation available at the time of preparation. Names\r\nand/or boundaries may have changed subsequently.\r\n\r\nCountry name: This entry includes all forms of the country's\r\nname approved by the US Board on Geographic Names (Italy is\r\nused as an example): conventional long form (Italian\r\nRepublic), conventional short form (Italy), local long form\r\n(Repubblica Italiana), local short form (Italia), former\r\n(Kingdom of Italy), as well as the abbreviation. Also see\r\nthe Terminology note.\r\n\r\nCurrency: This entry identifies the national medium of\r\nexchange and its basic subunit.\r\n\r\nData code: This entry gives the official US Government\r\ndigraph that precisely identifies every land entity without\r\noverlap, duplication, or omission. AF, for example, is the\r\ndata code for Afghanistan. This two-letter country code is a\r\nstandardized geopolitical data element promulgated in the\r\nFederal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS)\r\n10-4 by the National Institute of Standards and Technology\r\nat the US Department of Commerce and maintained by the\r\nOffice of the Geographer and Global Issues at the US\r\nDepartment of State. The data code is used to eliminate\r\nconfusion and incompatibility in the collection, processing,\r\nand dissemination of area-specific data and is particularly\r\nuseful for interchanging data between databases. Appendix F\r\ncross-references various country data codes and Appendix G\r\ndoes the same thing for hydrographic data codes.\r\n\r\nData codes--country: This information is presented in\r\nAppendix F: Cross-Reference List of Country Data Codes which\r\nincludes the US Government approved Federal Information\r\nProcessing Standards (FIPS) codes, the International\r\nOrganization for Standardization (ISO) codes, and Internet\r\ncodes for land entities.\r\n\r\nData codes--hydrographic: This information is presented in\r\nAppendix G: Cross-Reference List of Hydrographic Data Codes\r\nwhich includes the International Hydrographic Organization\r\n(IHO) codes, Aeronautical Chart and Information Center\r\n(ACIC; now National Imagery and Mapping Agency or NIMA)\r\ncodes, and Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) codes for\r\nhydrographic entities. The US Government has not yet\r\napproved a standard for hydrographic data codes similar to\r\nthe FIPS 10-4 standard for country data codes.\r\n\r\nDate of information: In general, information available as of\r\n1 January 1999, was used in the preparation of this edition.\r\n\r\nDeath rate: This entry gives the average annual number of\r\ndeaths during a year per 1,000 population at midyear; also\r\nknown as crude death rate. The death rate, while only a\r\nrough indicator of the mortality situation in a country,\r\naccurately indicates the current mortality impact on\r\npopulation growth. This indicator is significantly affected\r\nby age distribution, and most countries will eventually show\r\na rise in the overall death rate, in spite of continued\r\ndecline in mortality at all ages, as declining fertility\r\nresults in an aging population.\r\n\r\nDebt--external: This entry gives the total amount of public\r\nforeign financial obligations.\r\n\r\nDependency status: This entry describes the formal\r\nrelationship between a particular nonindependent entity and\r\nan independent state.\r\n\r\nDependent areas: This entry contains an alphabetical listing\r\nof all nonindependent entities associated in some way with a\r\nparticular independent state.\r\n\r\nDiplomatic representation: The US Government has diplomatic\r\nrelations with 184 independent states, including 178 of the\r\n185 UN members (excluded UN members are Bhutan, Cuba, Iran,\r\nIraq, North Korea, former Yugoslavia, and the US itself). In\r\naddition, the US has diplomatic relations with 6 independent\r\nstates that are not in the UN--Holy See, Kiribati, Nauru,\r\nSwitzerland, Tonga, and Tuvalu.\r\n\r\nDiplomatic representation from the US: This entry includes\r\nthe chief of mission, embassy address, mailing address,\r\ntelephone number, FAX number, branch office locations,\r\nconsulate general locations, and consulate locations.\r\n\r\nDiplomatic representation in the US: This entry includes the\r\nchief of the foreign mission, chancery address, telephone\r\nnumber, FAX number, consulate general locations, consulate\r\nlocations, honorary consulate general locations, and\r\nhonorary consulate locations.\r\n\r\nDisputes--international: This entry includes a wide variety\r\nof situations that range from traditional bilateral boundary\r\ndisputes to unilateral claims of one sort or another.\r\nInformation regarding disputes over international\r\nterrestrial and maritime boundaries has been reviewed by the\r\nUS Department of State. References to other situations\r\ninvolving borders or frontiers may also be included, such as\r\nresource disputes, geopolitical questions, or irredentist\r\nissues; however, inclusion does not necessarily constitute\r\nofficial acceptance or recognition by the US Government.\r\n\r\nEconomic aid--donor: This entry refers to net official\r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) from OECD nations to developing\r\ncountries and multilateral organizations. ODA is defined as\r\nfinancial assistance that is concessional in character, has\r\nthe main objective to promote economic development and\r\nwelfare of LDCs, and contains a grant element of at least\r\n25%. The entry does not cover other official flows (OOF) or\r\nprivate flows.\r\n\r\nEconomic aid--recipient: This entry, which is subject to\r\nmajor problems of definition and statistical coverage,\r\nrefers to the net inflow of Official Development Finance\r\n(ODF) to recipient countries. The figure includes assistance\r\nfrom the World Bank, the IMF, and other international\r\norganizations and from individual nation donors. Formal\r\ncommitments of aid are included in the data. Omitted from\r\nthe data are grants by private organizations. Aid comes in\r\nvarious forms including outright grants and loans. The entry\r\nthus is the difference between new inflows and repayments.\r\n\r\nEconomy: This category includes the entries dealing with the\r\nsize, development, and management of productive resources,\r\ni.e., land, labor, and capital.\r\n\r\nEconomy--overview: This entry briefly describes the type of\r\neconomy, including the degree of market orientation, the\r\nlevel of economic development, the most important natural\r\nresources, and the unique areas of specialization. It also\r\ncharacterizes major economic events and policy changes in\r\nthe most recent 12 months and may include a statement about\r\none or two key future macroeconomic trends.\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: This entry consists of total\r\nelectricity generated annually plus imports and minus\r\nexports, expressed in kilowatt hours.\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: This entry is the total exported\r\nelectricity in kilowatt hours.\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: This entry is the total imported\r\nelectricity in kilowatt hours.\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: This entry is the annual electricity\r\ngenerated expressed in kilowatt hours.\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source: This entry indicates the\r\npercentage share of annual electricity production of each\r\nenergy source.

Agreements are listed in alphabetical order by the\r\nabbreviated form of the full name.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental agreements: This information is presented in\r\nAppendix D: Selected International Environmental Agreements,\r\nwhich includes the name, abbreviation, date opened for\r\nsignature, date entered into force, objective, and parties\r\nby category.\r\n\r\nEthnic groups: This entry provides a rank ordering of ethnic\r\ngroups starting with the largest and normally includes the\r\npercent of total population.\r\n\r\nExchange rates: This entry provides the official value of a\r\ncountry's monetary unit at a given date or over a given\r\nperiod of time, as expressed in units of local currency per\r\nUS dollar and as determined by international market forces\r\nor official fiat.\r\n\r\nExecutive branch: This entry includes several subfields.\r\nChief of state includes the name and title of the titular\r\nleader of the country who represents the state at official\r\nand ceremonial functions but may not be involved with the\r\nday-to-day activities of the government. Head of government\r\nincludes the name and title of the top administrative leader\r\nwho is designated to manage the day-to-day activities of the\r\ngovernment. Cabinet includes the official name for this body\r\nof high-ranking advisers and the method for selection of\r\nmembers. Elections includes the nature of election process\r\nor accession to power, date of the last election, and date\r\nof the next election. Election results includes the percent\r\nof vote for each candidate in the last election. In the UK,\r\nthe monarch is the chief of state, and the prime minister is\r\nthe head of government. In the US, the president is both the\r\nchief of state and the head of government.\r\n\r\nExports: This entry provides the total US dollar amount of\r\nexports on an f.o.b. (free on board) basis.\r\n\r\nExports--commodities: This entry provides a rank ordering of\r\nexported products starting with the most important; it\r\nsometimes includes the percent of total dollar value.\r\n\r\nExports--partners: This entry provides a rank ordering of\r\ntrading partners starting with the most important; it\r\nsometimes includes the percent of total dollar value.\r\n\r\nFiscal year: This entry identifies the beginning and ending\r\nmonths for a country's accounting period of 12 months, which\r\noften is the calendar year but which may begin in any month.\r\nFY93/94 refers to the fiscal year that began in calendar\r\nyear 1993 and ended in calendar year 1994. All yearly\r\nreferences are for the calendar year (CY) unless indicated\r\nas a noncalendar fiscal year (FY).\r\n\r\nFlag description: This entry provides a written flag\r\ndescription produced from actual flags or the best\r\ninformation available at the time the entry was written. The\r\nflags of independent states are used by their dependencies\r\nunless there is an officially recognized local flag. Some\r\ndisputed and other areas do not have flags.\r\n\r\nFlag graphic: Most versions of the Factbook include a color\r\nflag at the beginning of the country profile. The flag\r\ngraphics were produced from actual flags or the best\r\ninformation available at the time of preparation. The flags\r\nof independent states are used by their dependencies unless\r\nthere is an officially recognized local flag. Some disputed\r\nand other areas do not have flags.\r\n\r\nGDP: This entry gives the gross domestic product (GDP) or\r\nvalue of all final goods and services produced within a\r\nnation in a given year. GDP dollar estimates in the Factbook\r\nare derived from purchasing power parity (PPP) calculations.\r\nSee the note on GDP methodology for more information.\r\n\r\nGDP methodology: In the Economy section, GDP dollar\r\nestimates for all countries are derived from purchasing\r\npower parity (PPP) calculations rather than from conversions\r\nat official currency exchange rates. The PPP method involves\r\nthe use of standardized international dollar price weights,\r\nwhich are applied to the quantities of final goods and\r\nservices produced in a given economy. The data derived from\r\nthe PPP method provide the best available starting point for\r\ncomparisons of economic strength and well-being between\r\ncountries. The division of a GDP estimate in domestic\r\ncurrency by the corresponding PPP estimate in dollars gives\r\nthe PPP conversion rate. Whereas PPP estimates for OECD\r\ncountries are quite reliable, PPP estimates for developing\r\ncountries are often rough approximations. Most of the GDP\r\nestimates are based on extrapolation of PPP numbers\r\npublished by the UN International Comparison Program (UNICP)\r\nand by Professors Robert Summers and Alan Heston of the\r\nUniversity of Pennsylvania and their colleagues. In\r\ncontrast, currency exchange rates depend on a variety of\r\ninternational and domestic financial forces that often have\r\nlittle relation to domestic output. In developing countries\r\nwith weak currencies the exchange rate estimate of GDP in\r\ndollars is typically one-fourth to one-half the PPP\r\nestimate. Furthermore, exchange rates may suddenly go up or\r\ndown by 10% or more because of market forces or official\r\nfiat whereas real output has remained unchanged. On 12\r\nJanuary 1994, for example, the 14 countries of the African\r\nFinancial Community (whose currencies are tied to the French\r\nfranc) devalued their currencies by 50%. This move, of\r\ncourse, did not cut the real output of these countries by\r\nhalf. One important caution: the proportion of, say, defense\r\nexpenditures as a percentage of GDP in local currency\r\naccounts may differ substantially from the proportion when\r\nGDP accounts are expressed in PPP terms, as, for example,\r\nwhen an observer tries to estimate the dollar level of\r\nRussian or Japanese military expenditures. Note: the numbers\r\nfor GDP and other economic data can not be chained together\r\nfrom successive volumes of the Factbook because of changes\r\nin the US dollar measuring rod, revisions of data by\r\nstatistical agencies, use of new or different sources of\r\ninformation, and changes in national statistical methods and\r\npractices. For statistical series on GDP and other economic\r\nvariables, see the Handbook of International Economic\r\nStatistics available from the same sources as The World\r\nFactbook.\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector: This entry gives the percentage\r\ncontribution of agriculture, industry, and services to total\r\nGDP.\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: This entry shows GDP on a purchasing power\r\nparity basis divided by population as of 1 July for the same\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: This entry gives GDP growth on an\r\nannual basis adjusted for inflation and expressed as a\r\npercent.\r\n\r\nGeographic coordinates: This entry includes rounded latitude\r\nand longitude figures for the purpose of finding the\r\napproximate geographic center of an entity and is based on\r\nthe Gazetteer of Conventional Names, Third Edition, August\r\n1988, US Board on Geographic Names and on other sources.\r\n\r\nGeographic names: This information is presented in Appendix\r\nH: Cross-Reference List of Geographic Names which indicates\r\nwhere various geographic names--including alternate names,\r\nformer names, political or geographical portions of larger\r\nentities, and the location of all US Foreign Service\r\nposts--can be found in The World Factbook. Spellings are\r\nnormally, but not always, those approved by the US Board on\r\nGeographic Names (BGN). Alternate names are included in\r\nparentheses, while additional information is included in\r\nbrackets.\r\n\r\nGeography: This category includes the entries dealing with\r\nthe natural environment and the effects of human activity.\r\n\r\nGeography--note: This entry includes miscellaneous geographic\r\ninformation of significance not included elsewhere.\r\n\r\nGNP: Gross national product (GNP) is the value of all final\r\ngoods and services produced within a nation in a given year,\r\nplus income earned by its citizens abroad, minus income\r\nearned by foreigners from domestic production. The Factbook,\r\nfollowing current practice, uses GDP rather than GNP to\r\nmeasure national production. However, the user must realize\r\nthat in certain countries net remittances from citizens\r\nworking abroad may be important to national well-being.\r\n\r\nGovernment: This category includes the entries dealing with\r\nthe system for the adoption and administration of public\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nGovernment type: This entry gives the basic form of\r\ngovernment (e.g., republic, constitutional monarchy, federal\r\nrepublic, parliamentary democracy, military dictatorship).\r\n\r\nGovernment--note: This entry includes miscellaneous\r\ngovernment information of significance not included\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nGross domestic product: see GDP\r\n\r\nGross national product: see GNP\r\n\r\nGross world product: see GWP\r\n\r\nGWP: This entry gives the gross world product (GWP) or\r\naggregate value of all final goods and services produced\r\nworldwide in a given year.\r\n\r\nHeliports: This entry gives the total number of established\r\nhelicopter takeoff and landing sites (which may or may not\r\nhave fuel or other services).\r\n\r\nHighways: This entry includes the total length of the\r\nhighway system as well as the length of the paved and\r\nunpaved components.\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share: Data on\r\nhousehold income or consumption come from household surveys,\r\nthe results adjusted for household size. Nations use\r\ndifferent standards and procedures in collecting and\r\nadjusting the data. Surveys based on income will normally\r\nshow a more unequal distribution than surveys based on\r\nconsumption. The quality of surveys is improving with time,\r\nyet caution is still necessary in making inter-country\r\ncomparisons.\r\n\r\nIllicit drugs: This entry gives information on the five\r\ncategories of illicit drugs--narcotics, stimulants,\r\ndepressants (sedatives), hallucinogens, and cannabis. These\r\ncategories include many drugs legally produced and\r\nprescribed by doctors as well as those illegally produced\r\nand sold outside of medical channels.\r\n\r\nCannabis (Cannabis sativa) is the common hemp plant, which\r\nprovides hallucinogens with some sedative properties, and\r\nincludes marijuana (pot, Acapulco gold, grass, reefer),\r\ntetrahydrocannabinol (THC, Marinol), hashish (hash), and\r\nhashish oil (hash oil).\r\n\r\nCoca (mostly Erythroxylum coca) is a bush with leaves that\r\ncontain the stimulant used to make cocaine. Coca is not to\r\nbe confused with cocoa, which comes from cacao seeds and is\r\nused in making chocolate, cocoa, and cocoa butter.\r\n\r\nCocaine is a stimulant derived from the leaves of the coca\r\nbush.\r\n\r\nDepressants (sedatives) are drugs that reduce tension and\r\nanxiety and include chloral hydrate, barbiturates (Amytal,\r\nNembutal, Seconal, phenobarbital), benzodiazepines (Librium,\r\nValium), methaqualone (Quaalude), glutethimide (Doriden),\r\nand others (Equanil, Placidyl, Valmid).\r\n\r\nDrugs are any chemical substances that effect a physical,\r\nmental, emotional, or behavioral change in an individual.\r\n\r\nDrug abuse is the use of any licit or illicit chemical\r\nsubstance that results in physical, mental, emotional, or\r\nbehavioral impairment in an individual.\r\n\r\nHallucinogens are drugs that affect sensation, thinking,\r\nself-awareness, and emotion. Hallucinogens include LSD\r\n(acid, microdot), mescaline and peyote (mexc, buttons,\r\ncactus), amphetamine variants (PMA, STP, DOB), phencyclidine\r\n(PCP, angel dust, hog), phencyclidine analogues (PCE, PCPy,\r\nTCP), and others (psilocybin, psilocyn).\r\n\r\nHashish is the resinous exudate of the cannabis or hemp\r\nplant (Cannabis sativa).\r\n\r\nHeroin is a semisynthetic derivative of morphine.\r\n\r\nMandrax is a trade name for methaqualone, a pharmaceutical\r\ndepressant.\r\n\r\nMarijuana is the dried leaves of the cannabis or hemp plant\r\n(Cannabis sativa).\r\n\r\nMethaqualone is a pharmaceutical depressant, referred to as\r\nmandrax in Southwest Asia.\r\n\r\nNarcotics are drugs that relieve pain, often induce sleep,\r\nand refer to opium, opium derivatives, and synthetic\r\nsubstitutes. Natural narcotics include opium (paregoric,\r\nparepectolin), morphine (MS-Contin, Roxanol), codeine\r\n(Tylenol with codeine, Empirin with codeine, Robitussan AC),\r\nand thebaine. Semisynthetic narcotics include heroin (horse,\r\nsmack), and hydromorphone (Dilaudid). Synthetic narcotics\r\ninclude meperidine or Pethidine (Demerol, Mepergan),\r\nmethadone (Dolophine, Methadose), and others (Darvon,\r\nLomotil).\r\n\r\nOpium is the brown, gummy exudate of the incised, unripe\r\nseedpod of the opium poppy.\r\n\r\nOpium poppy (Papaver somniferum) is the source for the\r\nnatural and semisynthetic narcotics.\r\n\r\nPoppy straw concentrate is the alkaloid derived from the\r\nmature, dried opium poppy.\r\n\r\nQat (kat, khat) is a stimulant from the buds or leaves of\r\nCatha edulis that is chewed or drunk as tea.\r\n\r\nQuaaludes is the North American slang term for methaqualone,\r\na pharmaceutical depressant.\r\n\r\nStimulants are drugs that relieve mild depression, increase\r\nenergy and activity, and include cocaine (coke, snow,\r\ncrack), amphetamines (Desoxyn, Dexedrine), phenmetrazine\r\n(Preludin), methylphenidate (Ritalin), and others (Cylert,\r\nSanorex, Tenuate).\r\n\r\nImports: This entry provides the total US dollar amount of\r\nimports on a c.i.f. (cost, insurance, and freight)or f.o.b.\r\n(free on board) basis.\r\n\r\nImports--commodities: This entry provides a rank ordering of\r\nimported products starting with the most important; it\r\nsometimes includes the percent of total dollar value.\r\n\r\nImports--partners: This entry provides a rank ordering of\r\ntrading partners starting with the most important; it\r\nsometimes includes the percent of total dollar value.\r\n\r\nIndependence: For most countries, this entry gives the date\r\nthat sovereignty was achieved, and from which nation,\r\nempire, or trusteeship. For the other countries, the date\r\ngiven may not represent \"independence\" in the strict sense,\r\nbut rather some significant nationhood event such as\r\ntraditional founding date, date of unification, federation,\r\nconfederation, establishment, fundamental change in the form\r\nof government, or state succession. Dependent areas include\r\nthe notation \"none\" followed by the nature of their\r\ndependency status. Also see the Terminology note.\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: This entry gives the\r\nannual percentage increase in industrial production\r\n(includes manufacturing, mining, and construction).\r\n\r\nIndustries: This entry provides a rank ordering of\r\nindustries starting with the largest by value of annual\r\noutput.\r\n\r\nInfant mortality rate: This entry gives the number of deaths\r\nof infants under one year old in a given year per 1,000 live\r\nbirths in the same year. This rate is often used an\r\nindicator of the level of health in a country.\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): This entry furnishes the\r\nannual percent change in consumer prices compared with the\r\nprevious year's consumer prices.\r\n\r\nInternational disputes: see Disputes--international\r\n\r\nInternational organization participation: This entry lists\r\nin alphabetical order by abbreviation those international\r\norganizations in which the subject country is a member or\r\nparticipates in some other way.\r\n\r\nInternational organizations: This information is presented\r\nin Appendix C: International Organizations and Groups which\r\nincludes the name, abbreviation, address, telephone, FAX,\r\ndate established, aim, and members by category.\r\n\r\nIntroduction: This category includes one entry, Background.\r\nAt present it appears in only a few country profiles, but\r\nwill be added to others in the future.\r\n\r\nIrrigated land: This entry gives the number of square\r\nkilometers of land area that is artificially supplied with\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nJudicial branch: This entry contains the name(s) of the\r\nhighest court(s) and a brief description of the selection\r\nprocess for members.\r\n\r\nLabor force: This entry contains the total labor force\r\nfigure.\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: This entry contains a rank\r\nordering of component parts of the labor force by\r\noccupation.\r\n\r\nLand boundaries: This entry contains the total length of all\r\nland boundaries and the individual lengths for each of the\r\ncontiguous border countries.\r\n\r\nLand use: This entry contains the percentage shares of total\r\nland area for five different types of land use. Arable\r\nland--land cultivated for crops that are replanted after each\r\nharvest like wheat, maize, and rice. Permanent crops--land\r\ncultivated for crops that are not replanted after each\r\nharvest like citrus, coffee, and rubber. Permanent\r\npastures--land permanently used for herbaceous forage crops.\r\nForests and woodland--land under dense or open stands of\r\ntrees. Other--any land type not specifically mentioned above,\r\nsuch as urban areas, roads, desert, etc.\r\n\r\nLanguages: This entry provides a rank ordering of languages\r\nstarting with the largest and sometimes includes the percent\r\nof total population speaking that language.\r\n\r\nLegal system: This entry contains a brief description of the\r\nlegal system's historical roots, role in government, and\r\nacceptance of International Court of Justice (ICJ)\r\njurisdiction.\r\n\r\nLegislative branch: This entry contains information on the\r\nstructure (unicameral, bicameral, tricameral), formal name,\r\nnumber of seats, and term of office. Elections includes the\r\nnature of election process or accession to power, date of\r\nthe last election, and date of the next election. Election\r\nresults includes the percent of vote and/or number of seats\r\nheld by each party in the last election.\r\n\r\nLife expectancy at birth: This entry contains the average\r\nnumber of years to be lived by a group of people born in the\r\nsame year, if mortality at each age remains constant in the\r\nfuture. The entry includes total population as well as the\r\nmale and female components. Life expectancy at birth is also\r\na measure of overall quality of life in a country and\r\nsummarizes the mortality at all ages. It can also be thought\r\nof as indicating the potential return on investment in human\r\ncapital and is necessary for the calculation of various\r\nactuarial measures.\r\n\r\nLiteracy: This entry includes a definition of literacy and\r\nCensus Bureau percentages for the total population, males,\r\nand females. There are no universal definitions and\r\nstandards of literacy. Unless otherwise specified, all rates\r\nare based on the most common definition--the ability to read\r\nand write at a specified age. Detailing the standards that\r\nindividual countries use to assess the ability to read and\r\nwrite is beyond the scope of the Factbook. Information on\r\nliteracy, while not a perfect measure of educational\r\nresults, is probably the most easily available and valid for\r\ninternational comparisons. Low levels of literacy, and\r\neducation in general, can impede the economic development of\r\na country in the current rapidly changing, technology-driven\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nLocation: This entry identifies the country's regional\r\nlocation, neighboring countries, and adjacent bodies of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nMap references: This entry includes the name of the Factbook\r\nreference map on which a country may be found. The entry on\r\nGeographic coordinates may be helpful in finding some\r\nsmaller countries.\r\n\r\nMaritime claims: This entry includes the following claims:\r\ncontiguous zone, continental shelf, exclusive economic zone,\r\nexclusive fishing zone, extended fishing zone, none (usually\r\nfor a landlocked country), other (unique maritime claims\r\nlike Libya's Gulf of Sidra Closing Line or North Korea's\r\nMilitary Boundary Line), and territorial sea. The proximity\r\nof neighboring states may prevent some national claims from\r\nbeing extended the full distance.\r\n\r\nMerchant marine: Merchant marine may be defined as all ships\r\nengaged in the carriage of goods; all commercial vessels (as\r\nopposed to all nonmilitary ships), which excludes tugs,\r\nfishing vessels, offshore oil rigs, etc.; or a grouping of\r\nmerchant ships by nationality or register. This entry\r\ncontains information in two subfields--total and ships by\r\ntype. Total includes the total number of ships (1,000 GRT or\r\nover), total DWT for those ships, and total GRT for those\r\nships. Ships by type includes a listing of barge carriers,\r\nbulk cargo ships, cargo ships, combination bulk carriers,\r\ncombination ore/oil carriers, container ships, intermodal\r\nships, liquefied gas tankers, livestock carriers,\r\nmultifunction large--load carriers, oil tankers, passenger\r\nships, passenger-cargo ships, railcar carriers, refrigerated\r\ncargo ships, roll-on/roll-off cargo ships, short-sea\r\npassenger ships, specialized tankers, tanker tug-barges, and\r\nvehicle carriers.\r\n\r\nA captive register is a register of ships maintained by a\r\nterritory, possession, or colony primarily or exclusively\r\nfor the use of ships owned in the parent country; it is also\r\nreferred to as an offshore register, the offshore equivalent\r\nof an internal register. Ships on a captive register will\r\nfly the same flag as the parent country, or a local variant\r\nof it, but will be subject to the maritime laws and taxation\r\nrules of the offshore territory. Although the nature of a\r\ncaptive register makes it especially desirable for ships\r\nowned in the parent country, just as in the internal\r\nregister, the ships may also be owned abroad. The captive\r\nregister then acts as a flag of convenience register, except\r\nthat it is not the register of an independent state.\r\n\r\nA flag of convenience register is a national register\r\noffering registration to a merchant ship not owned in the\r\nflag state. The major flags of convenience (FOC) attract\r\nships to their registers by virtue of low fees, low or\r\nnonexistent taxation of profits, and liberal manning\r\nrequirements. True FOC registers are characterized by having\r\nrelatively few of the registered ships actually owned in the\r\nflag state. Thus, while virtually any flag can be used for\r\nships under a given set of circumstances, an FOC register is\r\none where the majority of the merchant fleet is owned\r\nabroad. It is also referred to as an open register.\r\n\r\nA flag state is the nation in which a ship is registered and\r\nwhich holds legal jurisdiction over operation of the ship,\r\nwhether at home or abroad. Maritime legislation of the flag\r\nstate determines how a ship is crewed and taxed and whether\r\na foreign-owned ship may be placed on the register. An\r\ninternal register is a register of ships maintained as a\r\nsubset of a national register. Ships on the internal\r\nregister fly the national flag and have that nationality but\r\nare subject to a separate set of maritime rules from those\r\non the main national register. These differences usually\r\ninclude lower taxation of profits, use of foreign nationals\r\nas crew members, and, usually, ownership outside the flag\r\nstate (when it functions as an FOC register). The Norwegian\r\nInternational Ship Register and Danish International Ship\r\nRegister are the most notable examples of an internal\r\nregister. Both have been instrumental in stemming flight\r\nfrom the national flag to flags of convenience and in\r\nattracting foreign-owned ships to the Norwegian and Danish\r\nflags.\r\n\r\nA merchant ship is a vessel that carries goods against\r\npayment of freight; it is commonly used to denote any\r\nnonmilitary ship but accurately restricted to commercial\r\nvessels only.\r\n\r\nA register is the record of a ship's ownership and\r\nnationality as listed with the maritime authorities of a\r\ncountry; also, it is the compendium of such individual\r\nships' registrations. Registration of a ship provides it\r\nwith a nationality and makes it subject to the laws of the\r\ncountry in which registered (the flag state) regardless of\r\nthe nationality of the ship's ultimate owner.\r\n\r\nMilitary: This category includes the entries dealing with a\r\ncountry's military structure, manpower, and expenditures.\r\n\r\nMilitary branches: This entry lists the names of the ground,\r\nnaval, air, marine, and other defense or security forces.\r\n\r\nMilitary expenditures--dollar figure: This entry gives\r\ncurrent military expenditures in US dollars; the figure is\r\ncalculated by multiplying the estimated defense spending in\r\npercentage terms by the gross domestic product (GDP)\r\ncalculated on an exchange rate basis not purchasing power\r\nparity (PPP) terms. The figure should be treated with\r\ncaution because of different price patterns and accounting\r\nmethods among nations, as well as wide variations in the\r\nstrength of their currencies.\r\n\r\nMilitary expenditures--percent of GDP: This entry gives\r\ncurrent military expenditures as an estimated percent of\r\ngross domestic product (GDP).\r\n\r\nMilitary manpower--availability: This entry gives the total\r\nnumbers of males and females age 15-49 and assumes that\r\nevery individual is fit to serve.\r\n\r\nMilitary manpower--fit for military service: This entry gives\r\nthe number of males and females age 15-49 fit for military\r\nservice. This is a more refined measure of potential\r\nmilitary manpower availability which tries to correct for\r\nthe health situation in the country and reduces the maximum\r\npotential number to a more realistic estimate of the actual\r\nnumber fit to serve.\r\n\r\nMilitary manpower--military age: This entry gives the minimum\r\nage at which an individual may volunteer for military\r\nservice or be subject to conscription.\r\n\r\nMilitary manpower--reaching military age annually: This entry\r\ngives the number of draft-age males and females entering the\r\nmilitary manpower pool in any given year and is a measure of\r\nthe availability of draft-age young adults.\r\n\r\nMilitary--note: This entry includes miscellaneous military\r\ninformation of significance not included elsewhere.\r\n\r\nMoney figures: All money figures are expressed in\r\ncontemporaneous US dollars unless otherwise indicated.\r\n\r\nNational holiday: This entry gives the primary national day\r\nof celebration--usually independence day.\r\n\r\nNationality: This entry provides the identifying terms for\r\ncitizens--noun and adjective.\r\n\r\nNatural hazards: This entry lists potential natural\r\ndisasters.\r\n\r\nNatural resources: This entry lists a country's mineral,\r\npetroleum, hydropower, and other resources of commercial\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nNet migration rate: This entry includes the figure for the\r\ndifference between the number of persons entering and\r\nleaving a country during the year per 1,000 persons (based\r\non midyear population). An excess of persons entering the\r\ncountry is referred to as net immigration (e.g., 3.56\r\nmigrants/1,000 population); an excess of persons leaving the\r\ncountry as net emigration (e.g., -9.26 migrants/1,000\r\npopulation). The net migration rate indicates the\r\ncontribution of migration to the overall level of population\r\nchange. High levels of migration can cause problems such as\r\nincreasing unemployment and potential ethnic strife (if\r\npeople are coming in) or a reduction in the labor force,\r\nperhaps in certain key sectors (if people are leaving).\r\n\r\nPeople: This category includes the entries dealing with the\r\ncharacteristics of the people and their society.\r\n\r\nPeople--note: This entry includes miscellaneous demographic\r\ninformation of significance not included elsewhere.\r\n\r\nPersonal Names--Capitalization: The Factbook capitalizes the\r\nsurname or family name of individuals for the convenience of\r\nour users who are faced with a world of different cultures\r\nand naming conventions. An example would be President SADDAM\r\nHusayn of Iraq. Saddam is his name and Husayn is his\r\nfather's name. He may be referred to as President SADDAM\r\nHusayn or President SADDAM, but not President Husayn. The\r\nneed for capitalization, bold type, underlining, italics, or\r\nsome other indicator of the individual's surname is apparent\r\nin the following examples: MAO Zedong, Fidel CASTRO Ruz,\r\nWilliam Jefferson CLINTON, and TUNKU SALAHUDDIN Abdul Aziz\r\nShah ibni Al-Marhum Sultan Hisammuddin Alam Shah. By knowing\r\nthe surname, a short form without all capital letters can be\r\nused with confidence as in President Saddam, President\r\nCastro, Chairman Mao, President Clinton, or Sultan Tunku\r\nSalahuddin. The same system of capitalization is extended to\r\nthe names of leaders with surnames that are not commonly\r\nused such as Queen ELIZABETH II.\r\n\r\nPersonal Names--Spelling: The romanization of personal names\r\nin the Factbook normally follows the same transliteration\r\nsystem used by the US Board on Geographic Names for spelling\r\nplace names. At times, however, a foreign leader expressly\r\nindicates a preference for, or the media or official\r\ndocuments regularly use, a romanized spelling that differs\r\nfrom the transliteration derived from the US Government\r\nstandard. In such cases, the Factbook uses the alternative\r\nspelling.\r\n\r\nPersonal Names--Titles: The Factbook capitalizes any valid\r\ntitle (or short form of it) immediately preceding a person's\r\nname. A title standing alone is lowercased. Examples:\r\nPresident YEL'TSIN and President CLINTON are chiefs of\r\nstate. In Russia, the president is chief of state and the\r\npremier is the head of the government, while in the US, the\r\npresident is both chief of state and head of government.\r\n\r\nPipelines: This entry gives the lengths and types of\r\npipelines for transporting products like natural gas, crude\r\noil, or petroleum products.\r\n\r\nPolitical parties and leaders: This entry includes a listing\r\nof significant political organizations and their leaders.\r\n\r\nPolitical pressure groups and leaders: This entry includes a\r\nlisting of organizations with leaders involved in politics,\r\nbut not standing for legislative election.\r\n\r\nPopulation: This entry gives an estimate from the US Bureau\r\nof the Census based on statistics from population censuses,\r\nvital statistics registration systems, or sample surveys\r\npertaining to the recent past and on assumptions about\r\nfuture trends. The total population presents one overall\r\nmeasure of the potential impact of the country on the world\r\nand within its region. Note: starting with the 1993\r\nFactbook, demographic estimates for some countries (mostly\r\nAfrican) have taken into account the effects of the growing\r\nincidence of AIDS infections. These countries are Botswana,\r\nBrazil, Burkina Faso, Burma, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon,\r\nCentral African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo,\r\nRepublic of the Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Guyana,\r\nHaiti, Honduras, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Namibia, Nigeria,\r\nRwanda, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Thailand, Uganda,\r\nZambia, and Zimbabwe.\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: National estimates of the\r\npercentage of the population lying below the poverty line\r\nare based on surveys of sub-groups, with the results\r\nweighted by the number of people in each group. Definitions\r\nof poverty vary considerably among nations. For example,\r\nrich nations generally employ more generous standards of\r\npoverty than poor nations.\r\n\r\nPopulation growth rate: The average annual percent change in\r\nthe population, resulting from a surplus (or deficit) of\r\nbirths over deaths and the balance of migrants entering and\r\nleaving a country. The rate may be positive or negative. The\r\ngrowth rate is a factor in determining how great a burden\r\nwould be imposed on a country by the changing needs of its\r\npeople for infrastructure (e.g., schools, hospitals,\r\nhousing, roads), resources (e.g., food, water, electricity),\r\nand jobs. Rapid population growth can be seen as threatening\r\nby neighboring countries.\r\n\r\nPorts and harbors: This entry lists the major ports and\r\nharbors selected on the basis of overall importance to each\r\ncountry. This is determined by evaluating a number of\r\nfactors (e.g., dollar value of goods handled, gross tonnage,\r\nfacilities, military significance).\r\n\r\nRadio broadcast stations: This entry includes the total\r\nnumber of AM, FM, and shortwave broadcast stations.\r\n\r\nRadios: This entry gives the total number of radio\r\nreceivers.\r\n\r\nRailways: This entry includes the total length of the\r\nrailway network and component parts by gauge: broad, dual,\r\nnarrow, standard, and other.\r\n\r\nReference maps: This section includes world, regional, and\r\nspecial or current interest maps.\r\n\r\nReligions: This entry includes a rank ordering of religions\r\nstarting with the largest and sometimes includes the percent\r\nof total population.\r\n\r\nSex ratio: This entry includes the number of males for each\r\nfemale in five age groups--at birth, under 15 years, 15-64\r\nyears, 65 years and over, and for the total population. Sex\r\nratio at birth has recently emerged as an indicator of\r\ncertain kinds of sex discrimination in some countries. For\r\ninstance, high sex ratios at birth in some Asian countries\r\nare now attributed to sex-selective abortion and infanticide\r\ndue to a strong preference for sons. This will affect future\r\nmarriage patterns and fertility patterns. Eventually it\r\ncould cause unrest among young adult males who are unable to\r\nfind partners. The sex ratio at birth for the World is 1.06\r\n(1999 est.).\r\n\r\nSuffrage: This entry gives the age at enfranchisement and\r\nwhether the right to vote is universal or restricted.\r\n\r\nTelephone numbers: All telephone numbers in the Factbook\r\nconsist of the country code in brackets, the city or area\r\ncode (where required) in parentheses, and the local number.\r\nThe one component that is not presented is the international\r\naccess code, which varies from country to country. For\r\nexample, an international direct dial telephone call placed\r\nfrom the US to Madrid, Spain, would be as follows:\r\n\r\n011 [34] (1) 577-xxxx where\r\n\r\n011 is the international access code for station-to-station\r\ncalls\r\n\r\n(01 is for calls other than station-to-station calls),\r\n\r\n[34] is the country code for Spain,\r\n\r\n(1) is the city code for Madrid,\r\n\r\n577 is the local exchange, and\r\n\r\nxxxx is the local telephone number.\r\n\r\nAn international direct dial telephone call placed from\r\nanother country to the US would be as follows:\r\n\r\ninternational access code + [1] (202) 939-xxxx, where\r\n\r\n[1] is the country code for the US,\r\n\r\n(202) is the area code for Washington, DC,\r\n\r\n939 is the local exchange, and\r\n\r\nxxxx is the local telephone number.\r\n\r\nTelephone system: This entry includes a brief\r\ncharacterization of the system with details on the domestic\r\nand international components. The following terms and\r\nabbreviations are used throughout the entry:\r\n\r\nArabsat--Arab Satellite Communications Organization (Riyadh,\r\nSaudi Arabia).\r\n\r\nAutodin--Automatic Digital Network (US Department of\r\nDefense).\r\n\r\nCB--citizen's band mobile radio communications.\r\n\r\ncellular telephone system--the telephones in this system are\r\nradio\r\n\r\ntransceivers, with each instrument having its own private\r\nradio frequency and sufficient radiated power to reach the\r\nbooster station in its area (cell), from which the telephone\r\nsignal is fed to a regular telephone exchange.\r\n\r\nCentral American Microwave System--a trunk microwave radio\r\nrelay system that links the countries of Central America and\r\nMexico with each other.\r\n\r\ncoaxial cable--a multichannel communication cable consisting\r\nof a central conducting wire, surrounded by and insulated\r\nfrom a cylindrical conducting shell;

For example, the word Country in the Country name\r\nentry refers to a wide variety of dependencies, areas of\r\nspecial sovereignty, uninhabited islands, and other entities\r\nin addition to the traditional countries or independent\r\nstates. Military is also used as an umbrella term for\r\nvarious civil defense, security, and defense activities in\r\nmany entries. The Independence entry includes the usual\r\ncolonial independence dates and former ruling states as well\r\nas other significant nationhood dates such as the\r\ntraditional founding date or the date of unification,\r\nfederation, confederation, establishment, or state\r\nsuccession that are not strictly independence dates.\r\nDependent areas have the nature of their dependency status\r\nnoted in this same entry.\r\n\r\nTerrain: This entry contains a brief description of the\r\ntopography.\r\n\r\nTotal fertility rate: This entry gives a figure for the\r\naverage number of children that would be born per woman if\r\nall women lived to the end of their childbearing years and\r\nbore children according to a given fertility rate at each\r\nage. The total fertility rate is a more direct measure of\r\nthe level of fertility than the crude birth rate, since it\r\nrefers to births per woman. This indicator shows the\r\npotential for population growth in the country. High rates\r\nwill also place some limits on the labor force participation\r\nrates for women. Large numbers of children born to women\r\nindicate large family sizes that might limit the ability of\r\nthe families to feed and educate their children.\r\n\r\nTransnational Issues: This category includes only two\r\nentries at the present time --Disputes--international and\r\nIllicit drugs--that deal with current issues going beyond\r\nnational boundaries.\r\n\r\nTransportation: This category includes the entries dealing\r\nwith the means for movement of people and goods.\r\n\r\nTransportation--note: This entry includes miscellaneous\r\ntransportation information of significance not included\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: This entry contains the percent of the\r\nlabor force that is without jobs. Substantial\r\nunderemployment might be noted.\r\n\r\nUnited Nations System: This information is presented in\r\nAppendix B: United Nations System as a chart, table, or text\r\n(depending on the version of the Factbook) that shows the\r\norganization of the UN in detail.\r\n\r\nWaterways: This entry gives the total length and individual\r\nnames of navigable rivers, canals, and other inland bodies\r\nof water.\r\n\r\nWeights and measures: This information is presented in\r\nAppendix E: Weights and Measures and includes mathematical\r\nnotations (mathematical powers and names), metric\r\ninterrelationships (prefix; symbol; length, weight, or\r\ncapacity; area; volume), and standard conversion factors.\r\n\r\nYears: All year references are for the calendar year (CY)\r\nunless indicated as fiscal year (FY). The calendar year is\r\nan accounting period of 12 months from 1 January to 31\r\nDecember. The fiscal year is an accounting period of 12\r\nmonths other than 1 January to 31 December. FY93/94 refers\r\nto the fiscal year that began in calendar year 1993 and\r\nended in calendar year 1994.\r\n\r\nNote: Information for the US and US dependencies was\r\ncompiled from material in the public domain and does not\r\nrepresent Intelligence Community estimates. The Handbook of\r\nInternational Economic Statistics, published annually in\r\nSeptember by the Central Intelligence Agency, contains\r\ndetailed economic information for the Organization for\r\nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, the\r\nsuccessor nations to the Soviet Union, and selected other\r\ncountries. The Handbook can be obtained wherever the\r\nFactbook is available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=====================================================================\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Brief History of Basic Intelligence and The World Factbook\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Intelligence Cycle is the process by which information is acquired,\r\nconverted into intelligence, and made available to policymakers.\r\nInformation is raw data from any source, data that may be fragmentary,\r\ncontradictory, unreliable, ambiguous, deceptive, or wrong. Intelligence\r\nis information that has been collected, integrated, evaluated,\r\nanalyzed, and interpreted. Finished intelligence is the final product\r\nof the Intelligence Cycle ready to be delivered to the policymaker.\r\n\r\nThe three types of finished intelligence are: basic, current, and\r\nestimative. Basic intelligence provides the fundamental and factual\r\nreference material on a country or issue. Current intelligence reports\r\non new developments. Estimative intelligence judges probable outcomes.\r\nThe three are mutually supportive: basic intelligence is the foundation\r\non which the other two are constructed; current intelligence\r\ncontinually updates the inventory of knowledge; and estimative\r\nintelligence revises overall interpretations of country and issue\r\nprospects for guidance of basic and current intelligence. The World\r\nFactbook, The President's Daily Brief, and the National Intelligence\r\nEstimates are examples of the three types of finished intelligence.\r\n\r\nThe United States has carried on foreign intelligence activities since\r\nthe days of George Washington, but only since World War II have they\r\nbeen coordinated on a governmentwide basis. Three programs have\r\nhighlighted the development of coordinated basic intelligence since\r\nthat time: (1) the Joint Army Navy Intelligence Studies (JANIS), (2)\r\nthe National Intelligence Survey (NIS), and (3) The World Factbook.\r\n\r\nDuring World War II, intelligence consumers realized that the\r\nproduction of basic intelligence by different components of the US\r\nGovernment resulted in a great duplication of effort and conflicting\r\ninformation. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 brought home\r\nto leaders in Congress and the executive branch the need for\r\nintegrating departmental reports to national policymakers. Detailed\r\ncoordinated information was needed not only on such major powers as\r\nGermany and Japan, but also on places of little previous interest. In\r\nthe Pacific Theater, for example, the Navy and Marines had to launch\r\namphibious operations against many islands about which information was\r\nunconfirmed or nonexistent. Intelligence authorities resolved that the\r\nUnited States should never again be caught unprepared.\r\n\r\nIn 1943, Gen. George B. Strong (G-2), Adm. H. C. Train (Office of Naval\r\nIntelligence--ONI), and Gen. William J. Donovan (Director of the Office\r\nof Strategic Services--OSS) decided that a joint effort should be\r\ninitiated. A steering committee was appointed on 27 April 1943 that\r\nrecommended the formation of a Joint Intelligence Study Publishing\r\nBoard to assemble, edit, coordinate, and publish the Joint Army Navy\r\nIntelligence Studies (JANIS). JANIS was the first interdepartmental\r\nbasic intelligence program to fulfill the needs of the US Government\r\nfor an authoritative and coordinated appraisal of strategic basic\r\nintelligence. Between April 1943 and July 1947, the board published 34\r\nJANIS studies. JANIS performed well in the war effort, and numerous\r\nletters of commendation were received, including a statement from Adm.\r\nForrest Sherman, Chief of Staff, Pacific Ocean Areas, which said,\r\n\"JANIS has become the indispensable reference work for the shore-based\r\nplanners.\"\r\n\r\nThe need for more comprehensive basic intelligence in the postwar world\r\nwas well expressed in 1946 by George S. Pettee, a noted author on\r\nnational security. He wrote in The Future of American Secret\r\nIntelligence (Infantry Journal Press, 1946, page 46) that world\r\nleadership in peace requires even more elaborate intelligence than war.\r\n\"The conduct of peace involves all countries, all human activities--not\r\njust the enemy and his war production.\"\r\n\r\nThe Central Intelligence Agency was established on 26 July 1947 and\r\nofficially began operating on 18 September 1947. Effective 1 October\r\n1947, the Director of Central Intelligence assumed operational\r\nresponsibility for JANIS. On 13 January 1948, the National Security\r\nCouncil issued Intelligence Directive (NSCID) No. 3, which authorized\r\nthe National Intelligence Survey (NIS) program as a peacetime\r\nreplacement for the wartime JANIS program. Before adequate NIS country\r\nsections could be produced, government agencies had to develop more\r\ncomprehensive gazetteers and better maps. The US Board on Geographic\r\nNames (BGN) compiled the names; the Department of the Interior produced\r\nthe gazetteers; and CIA produced the maps.\r\n\r\nThe Hoover Commission's Clark Committee, set up in 1954 to study the\r\nstructure and administration of the CIA, reported to Congress in 1955\r\nthat: \"The National Intelligence Survey is an invaluable publication\r\nwhich provides the essential elements of basic intelligence on all\r\nareas of the world. . . . There will always be a continuing requirement\r\nfor keeping the Survey up-to-date.\" The Factbook was created as an\r\nannual summary and update to the encyclopedic NIS studies. The first\r\nclassified Factbook was published in August 1962, and the first\r\nunclassified version was published in June 1971. The NIS program was\r\nterminated in 1973 except for the Factbook, map, and gazetteer\r\ncomponents. The 1975 Factbook was the first to be made available to the\r\npublic with sales through the US Government Printing Office (GPO). The\r\n1996 edition was printed by GPO and the 1997 edition was reprinted by\r\nGPO. The year 1999 marks the 52nd anniversary of the establishment of\r\nthe Central Intelligence Agency and the 56th year of continuous basic\r\nintelligence support to the US Government by The World Factbook and its\r\ntwo predecessor programs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=====================================================================\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPurchasing Information\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) prepares The World Factbook in\r\nprinted, CD-ROM, and Internet versions.

the country is essentially\r\n  divided along ethnic lines; the Taliban controls the capital of\r\n  Kabul and approximately two-thirds of the country including the\r\n  predominately ethnic Pashtun areas in southern Afghanistan;

Economic considerations have played second fiddle to\r\n  political and military upheavals during two decades of war,\r\n  including the nearly 10-year Soviet military occupation (which ended\r\n  15 February 1989). During that conflict one-third of the population\r\n  fled the country, with Pakistan and Iran sheltering a combined peak\r\n  of more than 6 million refugees. Now, only 750,000 registered Afghan\r\n  refugees remain in Pakistan and about 1.2 million in Iran. Another 1\r\n  million have probably moved into and around urban areas within\r\n  Afghanistan. Gross domestic product has fallen substantially over\r\n  the past 20 years because of the loss of labor and capital and the\r\n  disruption of trade and transport. Much of the population continues\r\n  to suffer from insufficient food, clothing, housing, and medical\r\n  care. Inflation remains a serious problem throughout the country,\r\n  with one estimate putting the rate at 240% in Kabul in 1996.\r\n  International aid can deal with only a fraction of the humanitarian\r\n  problem, let alone promote economic development. Government efforts\r\n  to encourage foreign investment have not worked. The economic\r\n  situation did not improve in 1998.

The economy rebounded in 1993-95 after a severe\r\n  depression accompanying the collapse of the previous centrally\r\n  planned system in 1990 and 1991. However, a weakening of government\r\n  resolve to maintain stabilization policies in the election year of\r\n  1996 contributed to renewal of inflationary pressures, spurred by\r\n  the budget deficit which exceeded 12%. The collapse of financial\r\n  pyramid schemes in early 1997--which had attracted deposits from a\r\n  substantial portion of Albania's population--triggered severe social\r\n  unrest which led to more than 1,500 deaths, widespread destruction\r\n  of property, and an 8% drop in GDP. The new government installed in\r\n  July 1997 has taken strong measures to restore public order and to\r\n  revive economic activity and trade. The economy continues to be\r\n  bolstered by remittances of some 20% of the labor force which works\r\n  abroad, mostly in Greece and Italy. These remittances supplement GDP\r\n  and help offset the large foreign trade deficit. Most agricultural\r\n  land was privatized in 1992, substantially improving peasant\r\n  incomes. In 1998, Albania probably recovered most if not all of the\r\n  7% drop in GDP of 1997.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$5 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 7% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$1,490 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 56%\r\n  industry: 21%\r\n  services: 23% (1997)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: 19.6% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 40% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 1.692 million (1994 est.)

Algeria has the fifth-largest\r\n  reserves of natural gas in the world and is the second largest gas\r\n  exporter; it ranks fourteenth for oil reserves. Algiers' efforts to\r\n  reform one of the most centrally planned economies in the Arab world\r\n  began after the 1986 collapse of world oil prices plunged the\r\n  country into a severe recession. In 1989, the government launched a\r\n  comprehensive, IMF-supported program to achieve economic\r\n  stabilization and to introduce market mechanisms into the economy.\r\n  Despite substantial progress toward economic adjustment, in 1992 the\r\n  reform drive stalled as Algiers became embroiled in political\r\n  turmoil. In September 1993, a new government was formed, and one\r\n  priority was the resumption and acceleration of the structural\r\n  adjustment process. Burdened with a heavy foreign debt, Algiers\r\n  concluded a one-year standby arrangement with the IMF in April 1994\r\n  and the following year signed onto a three-year extended fund\r\n  facility which ended 30 April 1998. Progress on economic reform, a\r\n  Paris Club debt rescheduling in 1995, and oil and gas sector\r\n  expansion have contributed to a recovery since 1995. Investments in\r\n  developing hydrocarbon resources have spurred growth, but the\r\n  economy remains heavily dependent on volatile oil and gas revenues.\r\n  The government has continued efforts to diversify the economy by\r\n  attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the energy sector\r\n  in order to reduce high unemployment and improve living standards.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$140.2 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 3.2% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$4,600 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 12%\r\n  industry: 51%\r\n  services: 37% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: 22.6% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 2.8%\r\n  highest 10%: 26.8% (1995)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 9% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 7.8 million (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: government 29.5%, agriculture 22%,\r\n  construction and public works 16.2%, industry 13.6%, commerce and\r\n  services 13.5%, transportation and communication 5.2% (1989)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 30% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $14.4 billion\r\n  expenditures: $15.7 billion, including capital expenditures of $4.4\r\n  million (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: petroleum, natural gas, light industries, mining,\r\n  electrical, petrochemical, food processing\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: -4% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 18.4 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 98.91%\r\n  hydro: 1.09%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 18.13 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 490 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 220 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: wheat, barley, oats, grapes, olives,\r\n  citrus, fruits;

According to\r\n  one observer, attempts by the government to develop a larger and\r\n  broader economy are restrained by Samoa's remote location, its\r\n  limited transportation, and its devastating hurricanes.

An estimated 10\r\n  million tourists visit annually, attracted by Andorra's duty-free\r\n  status and by its summer and winter resorts. Andorra's comparative\r\n  advantage has recently eroded as the economies of neighboring France\r\n  and Spain have been opened up, providing broader availability of\r\n  goods and lower tariffs. The banking sector, with its \"tax haven\"\r\n  status, also contributes substantially to the economy. Agricultural\r\n  production is limited by a scarcity of arable land, and most food\r\n  has to be imported. The principal livestock activity is sheep\r\n  raising. Manufacturing consists mainly of cigarettes, cigars, and\r\n  furniture. Andorra is a member of the EU Customs Union and is\r\n  treated as an EU member for trade in manufactured goods (no tariffs)\r\n  and as a non-EU member for agricultural products.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$1.2 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$18,000 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NA%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): NA%\r\n\r\nLabor force: NA\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 0%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $138 million\r\n  expenditures: $177 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1993)\r\n\r\nIndustries: tourism (particularly skiing), sheep, timber,\r\n  tobacco, banking\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 140 million kWh (1992)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: NA%\r\n  hydro: NA%\r\n  nuclear: NA%\r\n  other: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: NA kWh\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: NA kWh\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: NA kWh\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: tobacco, rye, wheat, barley, oats,\r\n  vegetables;

Despite its\r\n  abundant natural resources, output per capita is among the world's\r\n  lowest. Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for 85%\r\n  of the population. Oil production and the supporting activities are\r\n  vital to the economy, contributing about 45% to GDP. Notwithstanding\r\n  the signing of a peace accord in November 1994, sporadic violence\r\n  continues, millions of land mines remain, and many farmers are\r\n  reluctant to return to their fields. As a result, much of the\r\n  country's food must still be imported. To take advantage of its rich\r\n  resources--gold, diamonds, extensive forests, Atlantic fisheries,\r\n  arable land, and large oil deposits--Angola will need to implement\r\n  the peace agreement and reform government policies.

The economy, and especially\r\n  the tourism sector, suffered a setback in late 1995 due to the\r\n  effects of Hurricane Luis in September but recovered in 1996.\r\n  Increased activity in the tourism industry, which has spurred the\r\n  growth of the construction sector, contributed to economic growth in\r\n  1997-98. Anguillan officials have put substantial effort into\r\n  developing the offshore financing sector. A comprehensive package of\r\n  financial services legislation was enacted in late 1994. In the\r\n  medium term, prospects for the economy will depend on the tourism\r\n  sector and, therefore, on continuing income growth in the\r\n  industrialized nations.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$81 million (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 6.5% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$7,300 (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 4%\r\n  industry: 16%\r\n  services: 80% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 0.6% (1997)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 4,400 (1992)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: commerce 36%, services 29%,\r\n  construction 18%, transportation and utilities 10%, manufacturing\r\n  3%, agriculture/fishing/forestry/mining 4%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 7% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $20.4 million\r\n  expenditures: $23.3 million, including capital expenditures of $3.8\r\n  million (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: tourism, boat building, offshore financial services\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 3.1% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: NA kWh\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: NA%\r\n  hydro: NA%\r\n  nuclear: NA%\r\n  other: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: NA kWh\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: NA kWh\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: NA kWh\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: pigeon peas, corn, sweet potatoes;

Other agreements--some 200 recommendations adopted at treaty\r\n  consultative meetings and ratified by governments include --Agreed\r\n  Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora (1964);\r\n  Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals (1972);\r\n  Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources\r\n  (1980); a mineral resources agreement was signed in 1988 but was\r\n  subsequently rejected; the Protocol on Environmental Protection to\r\n  the Antarctic Treaty was signed 4 October 1991 and entered into\r\n  force 14 January 1998; this agreement provides for the protection of\r\n  the Antarctic environment through five specific annexes on marine\r\n  pollution, fauna, and flora, environmental impact assessments, waste\r\n  management, and protected areas; it prohibits all activities\r\n  relating to mineral resources except scientific research.\r\n\r\nLegal system: US law, including certain criminal offenses by or\r\n  against US nationals, such as murder, may apply to areas not under\r\n  jurisdiction of other countries. Some US laws directly apply to\r\n  Antarctica. For example, the Antarctic Conservation Act, 16 U.S.C.\r\n  section 2401 et seq., provides civil and criminal penalties for the\r\n  following activities, unless authorized by regulation of statute:\r\n  the taking of native mammals or birds; the introduction of\r\n  nonindigenous plants and animals; entry into specially protected or\r\n  scientific areas; the discharge or disposal of pollutants; and the\r\n  importation into the US of certain items from Antarctica. Violation\r\n  of the Antarctic Conservation Act carries penalties of up to $10,000\r\n  in fines and one year in prison. The Departments of Treasury,\r\n  Commerce, Transportation, and Interior share enforcement\r\n  responsibilities. Public Law 95-541, the US Antarctic Conservation\r\n  Act of 1978, requires expeditions from the US to Antarctica to\r\n  notify, in advance, the Office of Oceans and Polar Affairs, Room\r\n  5801, Department of State, Washington, DC 20520, which reports such\r\n  plans to other nations as required by the Antarctic Treaty.

Antarctic fisheries in 1997-98 reported landing 92,456\r\n  metric tons. Unregulated fishing landed five to six times more than\r\n  the regulated fishery, and allegedly illegal fishing in antarctic\r\n  waters in 1998 resulted in the seizure (by France and Australia) of\r\n  at least eight fishing ships. A total of 9,604 tourists visited in\r\n  the 1997-98 summer, up from the 7,413 who visited the previous year.\r\n  Nearly all of them were passengers on 13 commercial\r\n  (nongovernmental) ships that made 92 trips during the summer. Around\r\n  200 tourists were on yachts or commercial aircraft. Most tourist\r\n  trips lasted approximately two weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunications\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTelephones: NA\r\n\r\nTelephone system:\r\n  domestic: NA\r\n  international: NA\r\n\r\nRadio broadcast stations: AM NA, FM 2 (American Forces Antarctic\r\n  Network), shortwave 1 (Argentina Antarctic Base de Egercito\r\n  Esperanza) (1998)\r\n\r\nRadios: NA\r\n\r\nTelevision broadcast stations: 1 (American Forces Antarctic\r\n  Network-McMurdo) (1997)\r\n\r\nTelevisions: NA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTransportation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPorts and harbors: none;

Increased tourist arrivals have helped spur growth\r\n  in the construction and transport sectors. The dual island nation's\r\n  agricultural production is mainly directed to the domestic market;\r\n  the sector is constrained by the limited water supply and labor\r\n  shortages that reflect the pull of higher wages in tourism and\r\n  construction. Manufacturing comprises enclave-type assembly for\r\n  export with major products being bedding, handicrafts, and\r\n  electronic components. Prospects for economic growth in the medium\r\n  term will continue to depend on income growth in the industrialized\r\n  world, especially in the US, which accounts for about half of all\r\n  tourist arrivals.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$503 million (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 6% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$7,900 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 4%\r\n  industry: 12.5%\r\n  services: 83.5% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): -1.1% (1997)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 30,000\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: commerce and services 82%, agriculture\r\n  11%, industry 7% (1983)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 9% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $122.6 million\r\n  expenditures: $141.2 million, including capital expenditures of\r\n  $17.3 million (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: tourism, construction, light manufacturing (clothing,\r\n  alcohol, household appliances)\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 6% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 95 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 100%\r\n  hydro: 0%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 95 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: cotton, fruits, vegetables, bananas,\r\n  coconuts, cucumbers, mangoes, sugarcane;

Meantime, thanks to rich natural\r\n  resources and foreign investment, a modern agriculture and a\r\n  diversified industry were gradually developed. After World War II, a\r\n  long period of Peronist dictatorship was followed by rule by a\r\n  military junta. Democratic elections finally came in 1983, but both\r\n  the political and economic atmosphere remain susceptible to turmoil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeography\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: Southern South America, bordering the South Atlantic\r\n  Ocean, between Chile and Uruguay\r\n\r\nGeographic coordinates: 34 00 S, 64 00 W\r\n\r\nMap references: South America\r\n\r\nArea:\r\n  total: 2,766,890 sq km\r\n  land: 2,736,690 sq km\r\n  water: 30,200 sq km\r\n\r\nArea--comparative: slightly less than three-tenths the size of the\r\n  US\r\n\r\nLand boundaries:\r\n  total: 9,665 km\r\n  border countries: Bolivia 832 km, Brazil 1,224 km, Chile 5,150 km,\r\n  Paraguay 1,880 km, Uruguay 579 km\r\n\r\nCoastline: 4,989 km\r\n\r\nMaritime claims:\r\n  contiguous zone: 24 nm\r\n  continental shelf: 200 nm or to the edge of the continental margin\r\n  exclusive economic zone: 200 nm\r\n  territorial sea: 12 nm\r\n\r\nClimate: mostly temperate;

However, when President\r\n  Carlos MENEM took office in 1989, the country had piled up huge\r\n  external debts, inflation had reached 200% per month, and output was\r\n  plummeting. To combat the economic crisis, the government embarked\r\n  on a path of trade liberalization, deregulation, and privatization.\r\n  In 1991, it implemented radical monetary reforms which pegged the\r\n  peso to the US dollar and limited the growth in the monetary base by\r\n  law to the growth in reserves. Inflation fell sharply in subsequent\r\n  years. The Mexican peso crisis produced capital flight, the loss of\r\n  banking system deposits, and a severe, but short-lived, recession in\r\n  1995; a series of reforms to bolster the domestic banking system\r\n  followed. Real GDP growth recovered strongly, reaching almost 9% in\r\n  1997. In 1998, increasing investor anxiety over Brazil, its largest\r\n  trading partner, produced the highest domestic interest rates in\r\n  more than three years and slowed growth to 4.3%. Despite the\r\n  relatively high level of growth in recent years, double-digit\r\n  unemployment rates have persisted, largely because of rigidities in\r\n  Argentina's labor laws.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$374 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 4.3% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$10,300 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 7%\r\n  industry: 37%\r\n  services: 56% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: 25.5% (1991 est.)\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 1% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 14 million (1997)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture 12%, industry 31%,\r\n  services 57% (1985 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 12% (October 1998)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $56 billion\r\n  expenditures: $60 billion, including capital expenditures of $4\r\n  billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: food processing, motor vehicles, consumer durables,\r\n  textiles, chemicals and petrochemicals, printing, metallurgy, steel\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 2% (1998)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 64.669 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 45%\r\n  hydro: 44.3%\r\n  nuclear: 10.7%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 67.509 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 330 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 3.17 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: sunflower seeds, lemons, soybeans, grapes,\r\n  corn, tobacco, peanuts, tea, wheat;

Although\r\n  a cease-fire has been in effect since May 1994, the sides have not\r\n  made substantial progress toward a peaceful resolution. In January\r\n  1998, differences between President TER-PETROSSIAN and members of\r\n  his cabinet over the Nagorno-Karabakh peace process came to a head.\r\n  With the prime minister, defense minister, and security minister\r\n  arrayed against him, an isolated TER-PETROSSIAN resigned the\r\n  presidency on 3 February 1998. Prime Minister Robert KOCHARIAN was\r\n  elected president in March 1998.

Since the implosion of the\r\n  USSR in December 1991, Armenia has switched to small-scale\r\n  agriculture away from the large agroindustrial complexes of the\r\n  Soviet area. The agricultural sector has long-term needs for more\r\n  investment and updated technology. The privatization of industry has\r\n  been at a slower pace, but has been given renewed emphasis by the\r\n  current administration. Armenia is a food importer, and its mineral\r\n  deposits (gold, bauxite) are small. The ongoing conflict with\r\n  Azerbaijan over the ethnic Armenian-dominated region of\r\n  Nagorno-Karabakh and the breakup of the centrally directed economic\r\n  system of the former Soviet Union contributed to a severe economic\r\n  decline in the early 1990s. By 1994, however, the Armenian\r\n  Government had launched an ambitious IMF-sponsored economic program\r\n  that has resulted in positive growth rates in 1995-98. Armenia also\r\n  managed to slash inflation and to privatize most small- and\r\n  medium-sized enterprises. The chronic energy shortages Armenia\r\n  suffered in recent years have been largely offset by the energy\r\n  supplied by one of its nuclear power plants at Metsamor. The Russian\r\n  financial crisis generated concerns about Armenia's economic\r\n  performance in 1998. Although inflation dropped to 10% and GDP grew\r\n  about 6%, the industrial sector remained moribund. Much of Armenia's\r\n  population remains heavily dependent on remittances from relatives\r\n  abroad, and remittances from Russia fell off sharply in 1998.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$9.2 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 6% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$2,700 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 35%\r\n  industry: 30%\r\n  services: 35% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: 50% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 10% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 1.6 million (1997)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: manufacturing, mining, and\r\n  construction 25%, agriculture 38%, services 37%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 20% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $322 million\r\n  expenditures: $424 million, including capital expenditures of $80\r\n  million (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: much of industry is shut down;

Rich in natural resources,\r\n  Australia is a major exporter of agricultural products, minerals,\r\n  metals, and fossil fuels. Commodities account for 57% of the value\r\n  of total exports, so that a downturn in world commodity prices can\r\n  have a big impact on the economy. The government is pushing for\r\n  increased exports of manufactured goods, but competition in\r\n  international markets continues to be severe. Australia has suffered\r\n  from the low growth and high unemployment characterizing the OECD\r\n  countries in the early 1990s, but the economy has expanded at\r\n  reasonably steady rates in recent years. Canberra's emphasis on\r\n  reforms is a key factor behind the economy's resilience to the\r\n  regional crisis and its stronger than expected growth rate that\r\n  reached 4.5% last year.

After the annexation to Nazi\r\n  Germany in 1938 and subsequent occupation by the victorious Allied\r\n  powers, Austria's 1955 State Treaty declared the country\r\n  \"permanently neutral\" as a condition of the Soviet military\r\n  withdrawal. The Soviet collapse relieved the external pressure to\r\n  remain unaligned, but neutrality had evolved into a part of Austrian\r\n  cultural identity, which has led to an ongoing public debate over\r\n  whether Vienna legitimately can remain outside of European security\r\n  structures. A wealthy country, Austria joined the European Union in\r\n  1995 and, like many EU members, is adjusting to the new European\r\n  currency and struggling with high unemployment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeography\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: Central Europe, north of Italy and Slovenia\r\n\r\nGeographic coordinates: 47 20 N, 13 20 E\r\n\r\nMap references: Europe\r\n\r\nArea:\r\n  total: 83,858 sq km\r\n  land: 82,738 sq km\r\n  water: 1,120 sq km\r\n\r\nArea--comparative: slightly smaller than Maine\r\n\r\nLand boundaries:\r\n  total: 2,562 km\r\n  border countries: Czech Republic 362 km, Germany 784 km, Hungary 366\r\n  km, Italy 430 km, Liechtenstein 35 km, Slovakia 91 km, Slovenia 330\r\n  km, Switzerland 164 km\r\n\r\nCoastline: 0 km (landlocked)\r\n\r\nMaritime claims: none (landlocked)\r\n\r\nClimate: temperate;

As a member of the European Monetary\r\n  Union (EMU), Austria's economy is closely integrated with other EU\r\n  member countries, especially with Germany. Austria's membership in\r\n  the EU has drawn an influx of foreign investors attracted by\r\n  Austria's access to the single European market. Through\r\n  privatization efforts, the 1996-98 budget consolidation programs,\r\n  and austerity measures, Austria brought its total public sector\r\n  deficit down to 2.5% of GDP in 1997 and public debt--at 66% of GDP in\r\n  1997--more or less in line with the 60% of GDP required by the EU's\r\n  Maastricht criteria. Cuts mainly affect the civil service and\r\n  Austria's generous social system, the two major causes of the\r\n  government deficit. To meet increased competition from both EU and\r\n  Central European countries, Austria will need to emphasize\r\n  knowledge-based sectors of the economy and deregulate the service\r\n  sector, particularly telecommunications and energy. The strong GDP\r\n  growth of 1998 is expected to dwindle back to 2.3% in 1999, and\r\n  observers caution that this projection may be revised downwards in\r\n  view of the Asian and Brazilian crises and Germany's lower growth\r\n  projection.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$184.5 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 2.9% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$22,700 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 1.4%\r\n  industry: 30.8%\r\n  services: 67.8% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 0.9% (1998)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 3.7 million (1998)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: services 67.7%, industry and crafts\r\n  29%, agriculture and forestry 0.7% (salaried employees, 1997 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 7% (1999 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $50.4 billion\r\n  expenditures: $55.9 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: construction, machinery, vehicles and parts, food,\r\n  chemicals, lumber and wood processing, paper and paperboard,\r\n  communications equipment, tourism (1997)\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 4% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 52.15 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 34.4%\r\n  hydro: 65.6%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1997)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 56.1 billion kWh (1997)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 9.8 billion kWh (1997)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 9 billion kWh (1997)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: grains, potatoes, sugar beets, wine, fruit;\r\n  dairy products, cattle, pigs, poultry;

In 1918, Azerbaijan declared\r\n  independence from Russia, but was incorporated into the Soviet Union\r\n  in 1920. It again declared its independence in 1991, following the\r\n  collapse of the USSR. The conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia\r\n  over the Nagorno-Karabakh region is still unresolved after 10 years\r\n  and Baku has yet to settle disputes with its neighbors over oil\r\n  rights in the Caspian Sea. During the war, Karabakh Armenians\r\n  declared independence and seized almost 20% of the country's\r\n  territory, creating some 750,000 Azerbaijani refugees in the\r\n  process. Both sides have generally observed a Russian-mediated\r\n  cease-fire in place since May 1994.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeography\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: Southwestern Asia, bordering the Caspian Sea, between\r\n  Iran and Russia\r\n\r\nGeographic coordinates: 40 30 N, 47 30 E\r\n\r\nMap references: Commonwealth of Independent States\r\n\r\nArea:\r\n  total: 86,600 sq km\r\n  land: 86,100 sq km\r\n  water: 500 sq km\r\n  note: includes the exclave of Naxcivan Autonomous Republic and the\r\n  Nagorno-Karabakh region; the region's autonomy was abolished by\r\n  Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet on 26 November 1991\r\n\r\nArea--comparative: slightly smaller than Maine\r\n\r\nLand boundaries:\r\n  total: 2,013 km\r\n  border countries: Armenia (with Azerbaijan-proper) 566 km, Armenia\r\n  (with Azerbaijan-Naxcivan exclave) 221 km, Georgia 322 km, Iran\r\n  (with Azerbaijan-proper) 432 km, Iran (with Azerbaijan-Naxcivan\r\n  exclave) 179 km, Russia 284 km, Turkey 9 km\r\n\r\nCoastline: 0 km (landlocked)\r\n  note: Azerbaijan borders the Caspian Sea (800 km, est.)\r\n\r\nMaritime claims: none (landlocked)\r\n\r\nClimate: dry, semiarid steppe\r\n\r\nTerrain: large, flat Kur-Araz Ovaligi (Kura-Araks Lowland) (much\r\n  of it below sea level) with Great Caucasus Mountains to the north,\r\n  Qarabag Yaylasi (Karabakh Upland) in west;

It resembles\r\n  the Central Asian states in its majority Muslim population, high\r\n  structural unemployment, and low standard of living. The economy's\r\n  most prominent products are oil, cotton, and natural gas. Production\r\n  from the Caspian oil field declined through 1997 but registered an\r\n  increase in 1998. Negotiation of more than a dozen\r\n  production-sharing arrangements (PSAs) with foreign firms, which\r\n  have thus far committed $30 billion to oil field development, should\r\n  generate the funds needed to spur future industrial development. Oil\r\n  production under the first of these PSAs, with the Azerbaijan\r\n  International Operating Company, began in November 1997. Azerbaijan\r\n  shares all the formidable problems of the former Soviet republics in\r\n  making the transition from a command to a market economy, but its\r\n  considerable energy resources brighten its long-term prospects. Baku\r\n  has only recently begun making progress on economic reform, and old\r\n  economic ties and structures are slowly being replaced. A major\r\n  short-term obstacle to economic progress, including stepped up\r\n  foreign investment, is the continuing conflict with Armenia over the\r\n  Nagorno-Karabakh region. Trade with Russia and the other former\r\n  Soviet republics is declining in importance while trade is building\r\n  up with Turkey, Iran, the UAE, and the nations of Europe. A serious\r\n  long-term challenge is the maintenance of the competitiveness of\r\n  non-oil exports in world markets.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$12.9 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 10% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$1,640 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 22%\r\n  industry: 18%\r\n  services: 60% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): -7.6% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 2.9 million (1997)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture and forestry 32%, industry\r\n  and construction 15%, services 53% (1997)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 20% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $565 million\r\n  expenditures: $682 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: petroleum and natural gas, petroleum products,\r\n  oilfield equipment;

Moderate\r\n  growth in tourism receipts and a boom in construction of new hotels,\r\n  resorts, and residences led to an increase of the country's GDP by\r\n  an estimated 4% in 1998. Manufacturing and agriculture together\r\n  contribute less than 10% of GDP and show little growth, despite\r\n  government incentives aimed at those sectors. Overall growth\r\n  prospects in the short run will depend heavily on the fortunes of\r\n  the tourism sector and continued income growth in the US, which\r\n  accounts for the majority of tourist visitors.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$5.63 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 4% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$20,100 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 3%\r\n  industry: 5%\r\n  services: 92% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 0.4% (1997)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 148,000 (1996)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: government 30%, tourism 40%, business\r\n  services 10%, agriculture 5% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 9% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $766 million\r\n  expenditures: $845 million, including capital expenditures of $97\r\n  million (FY97/98)\r\n\r\nIndustries: tourism, banking, cement, oil refining and\r\n  transshipment, salt production, rum, aragonite, pharmaceuticals,\r\n  spiral-welded steel pipe\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 1 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 100%\r\n  hydro: 0%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 1 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: citrus, vegetables;

With its highly developed\r\n  communication and transport facilities, Bahrain is home to numerous\r\n  multinational firms with business in the Gulf. A large share of\r\n  exports consists of petroleum products made from imported crude.\r\n  Construction proceeds on several major industrial projects.\r\n  Unemployment, especially among the young, and the depletion of both\r\n  oil and underground water resources are major long-term economic\r\n  problems.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$8.2 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: -2% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$13,100 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 1%\r\n  industry: 46%\r\n  services: 53% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): -0.2% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 150,000 (1997 est.)\r\n  note: 44% of the population in the 15-64 age group is non-national\r\n  (July 1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: industry, commerce, and service 79%,\r\n  government 20%, agriculture 1% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 15% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $1.5 billion\r\n  expenditures: $1.9 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1999 budget)\r\n\r\nIndustries: petroleum processing and refining, aluminum smelting,\r\n  offshore banking, ship repairing;

The economy is largely agricultural, with\r\n  the cultivation of rice the single most important activity in the\r\n  economy. Major impediments to growth include frequent cyclones and\r\n  floods, the inefficiency of state-owned enterprises, a rapidly\r\n  growing labor force that cannot be absorbed by agriculture, delays\r\n  in exploiting energy resources (natural gas), inadequate power\r\n  supplies, and slow implementation of economic reforms. Prime\r\n  Minister Sheikh HASINA Wajed's Awami League government has made some\r\n  headway improving the climate for foreign investors and liberalizing\r\n  the capital markets; for example, it has negotiated with foreign\r\n  firms for oil and gas exploration, better countrywide distribution\r\n  of cooking gas, and the construction of natural gas pipelines and\r\n  power plants. Progress on other economic reforms has been halting\r\n  because of opposition from the bureaucracy, public sector unions,\r\n  and other vested interest groups. Severe floods, lasting from July\r\n  to October 1998, endangered the livelihoods of more than 20 million\r\n  people. Foodgrain production fell by 4 million tons, forcing Dhaka\r\n  to triple its normal foodgrain imports and placing severe pressure\r\n  on Bangladesh's balance of payments.

In keeping with this policy, LUKASHENKO\r\n  re-imposed administrative controls over prices and currency exchange\r\n  rates and expanded the state's right to intervene in the management\r\n  of private enterprise. This produced a climate hostile to private\r\n  business, inhibiting domestic and foreign investment. The Government\r\n  of Belarus has artificially revived economic output since mid-1996\r\n  by pursuing a policy of rapid credit expansion. In a vain attempt to\r\n  keep the rapidly rising inflation in check, the government placed\r\n  strict price controls on food and consumer products, which resulted\r\n  in food shortages. Long lines for dairy products, chicken, and pork\r\n  became common in the closing months of 1998. With the goal of\r\n  slowing down the devaluation of the Belarusian ruble, LUKASHENKO in\r\n  1997 introduced a new, complex system of legal buying/selling hard\r\n  currencies. The new \"command\" system proved to be totally unworkable\r\n  and resulted in galloping devaluation. In addition to the burdens\r\n  imposed on businesses by high inflation and an artificial currency\r\n  regime, businesses have also been subject to pressure on the part of\r\n  central and local governments, e.g., arbitrary changes in\r\n  regulations, numerous rigorous inspections, and retroactive\r\n  application of new business regulations prohibiting practices that\r\n  had been legal. A further economic problem is the sizable trade\r\n  deficit.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$53.7 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 7% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$5,200 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 20%\r\n  industry: 43%\r\n  services: 37% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: 77% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 4.9%\r\n  highest 10%: 19.4% (1993)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 182% (1998)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 4.3 million (1998)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: industry and construction 40%,\r\n  agriculture and forestry 19%, services 41% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 2.3% officially registered unemployed\r\n  (December 1998);

Industry is concentrated mainly in the populous\r\n  Flemish area in the north, although the government is encouraging\r\n  reinvestment in the southern region of Wallonia. With few natural\r\n  resources, Belgium must import substantial quantities of raw\r\n  materials and export a large volume of manufactures, making its\r\n  economy unusually dependent on the state of world markets.\r\n  Two-thirds of its trade is with other EU countries. Belgium's public\r\n  debt fell from 127% of GDP in 1996 to 122% of GDP in 1998 and the\r\n  government is trying to control its expenditures to bring the figure\r\n  more into line with other industrialized countries.

Sugar, the chief crop, accounts for nearly half of\r\n  exports, while the banana industry is the country's largest\r\n  employer. The government's tough austerity program in 1997 resulted\r\n  in an economic slowdown that continued in 1998. The trade deficit\r\n  has been growing, mostly as a result of low export prices for sugar\r\n  and bananas. The new government faces important challenges to\r\n  economic stability. Rapid action to improve tax collection has been\r\n  promised, but a lack of progress in reigning in spending could bring\r\n  the exchange rate under pressure.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$700 million (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 0.5% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$3,000 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 22%\r\n  industry: 22%\r\n  services: 56% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): -0.5% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 71,000\r\n  note: shortage of skilled labor and all types of technical personnel\r\n  (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture 30%, services 16%,\r\n  government 15.4%, commerce 11.2%, manufacturing 10.3%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 13% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $140 million\r\n  expenditures: $142 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (FY97/98 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: garment production, food processing, tourism,\r\n  construction\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 0.2% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 145 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 100%\r\n  hydro: 0%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 145 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: bananas, coca, citrus, sugarcane;

Growth in real output has averaged a sound 4% in\r\n  1990-95 and 5% in 1996-98. Rapid population growth has offset much\r\n  of this growth in output. Inflation has subsided over the past three\r\n  years. Commercial and transport activities, which make up a large\r\n  part of GDP, are vulnerable to developments in Nigeria, particularly\r\n  fuel shortages. Support by the Paris Club and official bilateral\r\n  creditors has eased the external debt situation in recent years. The\r\n  government, still burdened with money-losing state enterprises and a\r\n  bloated civil service, has been gradually implementing a World Bank\r\n  supported structural adjustment program since 1991.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$7.6 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 4.4% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$1,300 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 34%\r\n  industry: 14%\r\n  services: 52% (1997)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: 33% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 5.6% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: NA\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $299 million\r\n  expenditures: $445 million, including capital expenditures of $14\r\n  million (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: textiles, cigarettes;

The tourist\r\n  industry, which accounts for an estimated 28% of GDP, attracts 84%\r\n  of its business from North America. The industrial sector is small,\r\n  and agriculture is severely limited by a lack of suitable land.\r\n  About 80% of food needs are imported. International business\r\n  contributes over 60% of Bermuda's economic output; a failed\r\n  independence vote in late 1995 can be partially attributed to\r\n  Bermudian fears of scaring away foreign firms.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$1.9 billion (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 3% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$30,000 (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NA%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 2.1% (1997)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 35,296 (1997)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: clerical 23%, services 22%, laborers\r\n  17%, professional and technical 17%, administrative and managerial\r\n  12%, sales 7%, agriculture and fishing 2% (1996)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NEGL% (1995)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $504.6 million\r\n  expenditures: $537 million, including capital expenditures of $75\r\n  million (FY97/98)\r\n\r\nIndustries: tourism, finance, insurance, structural concrete\r\n  products, paints, perfumes, pharmaceuticals, ship repairing\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 480 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 100%\r\n  hydro: 0%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 480 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: bananas, vegetables, citrus, flowers;

Agriculture consists largely of subsistence farming and\r\n  animal husbandry. Rugged mountains dominate the terrain and make the\r\n  building of roads and other infrastructure difficult and expensive.\r\n  The economy is closely aligned with India's through strong trade and\r\n  monetary links. The industrial sector is technologically backward,\r\n  with most production of the cottage industry type.

The Bhutanese Government has made some progress in\r\n  expanding the nation's productive base and improving social welfare.\r\n  Model education, social, and environment programs in Bhutan are\r\n  underway with support from multilateral development organizations.\r\n  Each economic program takes into account the government's desire to\r\n  protect the country's environment and cultural traditions.

Its\r\n  subsequent history has been marked by a seemingly endless series of\r\n  coups, counter-coups, and abrupt changes in leaders and policies.\r\n  Comparatively democratic civilian rule was established in the 1980s,\r\n  but the leaders have faced difficult problems of deep-seated\r\n  poverty, social unrest, strikes, and drug dealing. Current issues\r\n  include encouraging and negotiating the terms for foreign\r\n  investment; strengthening the educational system; continuing the\r\n  privatization program; pursuing judicial reform and an\r\n  anti-corruption campaign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeography\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: Central South America, southwest of Brazil\r\n\r\nGeographic coordinates: 17 00 S, 65 00 W\r\n\r\nMap references: South America\r\n\r\nArea:\r\n  total: 1,098,580 sq km\r\n  land: 1,084,390 sq km\r\n  water: 14,190 sq km\r\n\r\nArea--comparative: slightly less than three times the size of\r\n  Montana\r\n\r\nLand boundaries:\r\n  total: 6,743 km\r\n  border countries: Argentina 832 km, Brazil 3,400 km, Chile 861 km,\r\n  Paraguay 750 km, Peru 900 km\r\n\r\nCoastline: 0 km (landlocked)\r\n\r\nMaritime claims: none (landlocked)\r\n\r\nClimate: varies with altitude;

However, Bolivia has experienced\r\n  generally improving economic conditions since the PAZ Estenssoro\r\n  administration (1985-89) introduced market-oriented policies which\r\n  reduced inflation from 11,700% in 1985 to about 20% in 1988. PAZ\r\n  Estenssoro was followed as president by Jaime PAZ Zamora (1989-93)\r\n  who continued the free-market policies of his predecessor, despite\r\n  opposition from his own party and from Bolivia's once powerful labor\r\n  movement. President SANCHEZ DE LOZADA (1993-1997) vowed to advance\r\n  the market-oriented economic reforms he helped launch as PAZ\r\n  Estenssoro's planning minister. His successes included the signing\r\n  of a free trade agreement with Mexico and the Southern Cone Common\r\n  Market (Mercosur) as well as the privatization of the state airline,\r\n  telephone company, railroad, electric power company, and oil\r\n  company. Hugo BANZER Suarez has tried to further improve the\r\n  country's investment climate with an anticorruption campaign. With\r\n  the scheduled completion of a $2 billion natural gas pipeline to\r\n  Brazil in 1999, Bolivia hopes to become an energy hub in the region.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$23.4 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 4.7% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$3,000 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 17%\r\n  industry: 26%\r\n  services: 57% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: 66%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 2.3%\r\n  highest 10%: 31.7% (1990)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 4.4% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 2.5 million\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture NA%, services and\r\n  utilities NA%, manufacturing, mining and construction NA%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 11.4% (1997) with widespread underemployment\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $2.7 billion\r\n  expenditures: $2.7 billion (1998)\r\n\r\nIndustries: mining, smelting, petroleum, food and beverages,\r\n  tobacco, handicrafts, clothing\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 4% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 2.95 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 40.68%\r\n  hydro: 59.32%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 2.948 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 2 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: soybeans, coffee, coca, cotton, corn,\r\n  sugarcane, rice, potatoes;

alternative crop program aims to reduce\r\n  illicit coca cultivation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n======================================================================\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n@Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBackground: On 21 November 1995, in Dayton, Ohio, the former\r\n  Yugoslavia's three warring parties signed a peace agreement that\r\n  brought to a halt over three years of interethnic civil strife in\r\n  Bosnia and Herzegovina (the final agreement was signed in Paris on\r\n  14 December 1995). The Dayton Agreement, signed then by Bosnian\r\n  President IZETBEGOVIC, Croatian President TUDJMAN, and Serbian\r\n  President MILOSEVIC, divides Bosnia and Herzegovina roughly equally\r\n  between the Muslim/Croat Federation and the Republika Srpska while\r\n  maintaining Bosnia's currently recognized borders. In 1995-96, a\r\n  NATO-led international peacekeeping force (IFOR) of 60,000 troops\r\n  served in Bosnia to implement and monitor the military aspects of\r\n  the agreement. IFOR was succeeded by a smaller, NATO-led\r\n  Stabilization Force (SFOR) whose mission is to deter renewed\r\n  hostilities. SFOR remains in place. A High Representative appointed\r\n  by the UN Security Council is responsible for civilian\r\n  implementation of the accord, including monitoring implementation,\r\n  facilitating any difficulties arising in connection with civilian\r\n  implementation, and coordinating activities of the civilian\r\n  organizations and agencies in Bosnia. The Bosnian conflict began in\r\n  the spring of 1992 when the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\n  held a referendum on independence and the Bosnian Serbs--supported by\r\n  neighboring Serbia--responded with armed resistance aimed at\r\n  partitioning the republic along ethnic lines and joining Serb-held\r\n  areas to form a \"greater Serbia.\" In March 1994, Bosnia's Muslims\r\n  and Croats reduced the number of warring factions from three to two\r\n  by signing an agreement in Washington creating their joint\r\n  Muslim/Croat Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Federation,\r\n  formed by the Muslims and Croats in March 1994, is one of two\r\n  entities (the other being the Bosnian Serb-led Republika Srpska)\r\n  that comprise Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeography\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: Southeastern Europe, bordering the Adriatic Sea and\r\n  Croatia\r\n\r\nGeographic coordinates: 44 00 N, 18 00 E\r\n\r\nMap references: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Europe\r\n\r\nArea:\r\n  total: 51,233 sq km\r\n  land: 51,233 sq km\r\n  water: 0 sq km\r\n\r\nArea--comparative: slightly smaller than West Virginia\r\n\r\nLand boundaries:\r\n  total: 1,459 km\r\n  border countries: Croatia 932 km, Serbia and Montenegro 527 km (312\r\n  km with Serbia, 215 km with Montenegro)\r\n\r\nCoastline: 20 km\r\n\r\nMaritime claims: NA\r\n\r\nClimate: hot summers and cold winters;

Bosnia was partitioned by fighting during 1992-95 and\r\n  governed by competing ethnic factions. Bosnia's current governing\r\n  structures were created by the Dayton Agreement, the 1995 peace\r\n  agreement which was officially signed in Paris on 14 December 1995\r\n  by then Bosnian President IZETBEGOVIC, Croatian President TUDJMAN,\r\n  and then Serbian President MILOSEVIC. This agreement retained\r\n  Bosnia's exterior border and created a joint multi-ethnic and\r\n  democratic government. This national government--based on\r\n  proportional representation similar to that which existed in the\r\n  former socialist regime--is charged with conducting foreign,\r\n  economic, and fiscal policy. The Dayton Agreement also recognized a\r\n  second tier of government, comprised of two entities--a joint\r\n  Muslim/Croat Federation and the Bosnian Serb Republika Srpska\r\n  (RS)--each presiding over roughly one-half the territory. The\r\n  Federation and RS governments are charged with overseeing internal\r\n  functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEconomy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEconomy--overview: Bosnia and Herzegovina ranked next to The\r\n  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as the poorest republic in the\r\n  old Yugoslav federation. Although agriculture has been almost all in\r\n  private hands, farms have been small and inefficient, and the\r\n  republic traditionally has been a net importer of food. Industry has\r\n  been greatly overstaffed, one reflection of the rigidities of\r\n  communist central planning and management. TITO had pushed the\r\n  development of military industries in the republic with the result\r\n  that Bosnia hosted a large share of Yugoslavia's defense plants. The\r\n  bitter interethnic warfare in Bosnia caused production to plummet by\r\n  80% from 1990 to 1995, unemployment to soar, and human misery to\r\n  multiply. With an uneasy peace in place, output has recovered in\r\n  1996-98 at high percentage rates on a low base, but remains far\r\n  below the 1990 level. Key achievements in 1998 included approval of\r\n  privatization legislation, the introduction of a national\r\n  currency--the convertible mark, agreement with the Paris Club to\r\n  reschedule official debt, and the conclusion of a Standby Agreement\r\n  with the IMF. Economic data are of limited use because, although\r\n  both entities issue figures, national-level statistics are not\r\n  available. Moreover, official data do not capture the large share of\r\n  activity that occurs on the black market. The country receives\r\n  substantial amounts of reconstruction assistance and humanitarian\r\n  aid from the international community. Wide regional differences in\r\n  war damage and access to the outside world have resulted in\r\n  substantial variations in living conditions among local areas and\r\n  individual families. In 1999, Bosnia's major goals are to implement\r\n  privatization and make progress in fiscal reform and management. In\r\n  addition, Bosnia will have to prepare for an era of declining\r\n  assistance from the international community.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$5.8 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 30% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$1,720 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 19%\r\n  industry: 23%\r\n  services: 58% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): NA%\r\n\r\nLabor force: 1,026,254\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: NA%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 40%-50% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $NA\r\n  expenditures: $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n\r\nIndustries: steel, coal, iron ore, lead, zinc, manganese,\r\n  bauxite, vehicle assembly, textiles, tobacco products, wooden\r\n  furniture, tank and aircraft assembly, domestic appliances, oil\r\n  refining (much of capacity damaged or shut down) (1995)\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 35% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 2.3 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 34.78%\r\n  hydro: 65.22%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 2.504 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 182 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 386 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: wheat, corn, fruits, vegetables;

Prior to the institution of\r\n  a stabilization plan--the Plano Real (Real Plan) in mid-1994,\r\n  stratospheric inflation rates had disrupted economic activity and\r\n  discouraged foreign investment. Since then, tight monetary policy\r\n  has brought inflation under control--consumer prices increased by 2%\r\n  in 1998 compared to more than 1,000% in 1994. At the same time, GDP\r\n  growth slowed from 5.7% in 1994 to about 3.0% in 1997 due to tighter\r\n  credit. The Real Plan faced its strongest challenge in 1998, as the\r\n  world financial crisis caused investors to more closely examine the\r\n  country's structural weaknesses. The most severe spillover for\r\n  Brazil--after Russia's debt default in August 1998--created\r\n  unrelenting pressure on the currency which forced the country to\r\n  hike annual interest rates to 50%. Approximately $30 billion in\r\n  capital left the country in August and September. After crafting a\r\n  fiscal adjustment program and pledging progress on structural\r\n  reform, Brazil received a $41.5 billion IMF-led international\r\n  support program in November 1998. Capital continued to leach out of\r\n  the country, and investors, concerned about the rising mountain of\r\n  debt and currency widely-viewed as overvalued, stayed on the\r\n  sidelines. In January 1999, Brazil made an abrupt shift of course in\r\n  exchange rate policy, abandoning the strong currency anti-inflation\r\n  anchor of the Real Plan. On 13 January 1999, Central Bank officials\r\n  announced a one-time 8% devaluation of the real, and on 15 January\r\n  1999, the currency was declared to be freely floating. President\r\n  CARDOSO remains committed to limiting inflation and weathering the\r\n  financial crisis through austerity and sacrifice as the country\r\n  rides out a deep recession. He hopes the country will resume\r\n  economic growth in the second half of 1999, so that he can once\r\n  again focus on his longer-term goal of reducing poverty and income\r\n  inequality. CARDOSO still hopes to address mandated revenue sharing\r\n  with the states and cumbersome procedures to amend the constitution\r\n  before the end of his second term.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$1.0352 trillion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 0.5% (1998)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$6,100 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 14%\r\n  industry: 36%\r\n  services: 50% (1997)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: 17.4% (1990 est.)\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 0.8%\r\n  highest 10%: 47.9% (1995)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 2% (1998)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 57 million (1989 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: services 42%, agriculture 31%,\r\n  industry 27%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 8.5% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $151 billion\r\n  expenditures: $149 billion, including capital expenditures of $36\r\n  billion (1998)\r\n\r\nIndustries: textiles, shoes, chemicals, cement, lumber, iron ore,\r\n  tin, steel, aircraft, motor vehicles and parts, other machinery and\r\n  equipment\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 4.5% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 291.63 billion kWh (1997)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 4.38%\r\n  hydro: 92.09%\r\n  nuclear: 0.8%\r\n  other: 2.73% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 323.215 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 8 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 37.5 billion kWh (1996)\r\n  note: imported electricity from Paraguay\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: coffee, soybeans, wheat, rice, corn,\r\n  sugarcane, cocoa, citrus;

In the mid-1980s, the\r\n  government began offering offshore registration to companies wishing\r\n  to incorporate in the islands, and incorporation fees now generate\r\n  substantial revenues. An estimated 250,000 companies were on the\r\n  offshore registry by yearend 1997. The adoption of a comprehensive\r\n  insurance law in late 1994, which provides a blanket of\r\n  confidentiality with regulated statutory gateways for investigation\r\n  of criminal offenses, is expected to make the British Virgin Islands\r\n  even more attractive to international business. Livestock raising is\r\n  the most important agricultural activity; poor soils limit the\r\n  islands' ability to meet domestic food requirements. Because of\r\n  traditionally close links with the US Virgin Islands, the British\r\n  Virgin Islands has used the dollar as its currency since 1959.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$183 million (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 4.7% (1997)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$10,000 (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 1%\r\n  industry: 1.4%\r\n  services: 97.6% (1991-95 average)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 6.5% (1997)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 4,911 (1980)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: tourism NA%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 3% (1995)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $121.5 million\r\n  expenditures: $115.5 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1997)\r\n\r\nIndustries: tourism, light industry, construction, rum, concrete\r\n  block, offshore financial center\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 4% (1985)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 42 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 100%\r\n  hydro: 0%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 42 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: fruits, vegetables;

It is almost totally\r\n  supported by exports of crude oil and natural gas, with revenues\r\n  from the petroleum sector accounting for over half of GDP. Per\r\n  capita GDP is far above most other Third World countries, and\r\n  substantial income from overseas investment supplements income from\r\n  domestic production. The government provides for all medical\r\n  services and subsidizes food and housing. The government is\r\n  beginning to show progress on its basic policy of diversifying the\r\n  economy away from oil and gas. Brunei's leaders are concerned that\r\n  steadily increased integration in the world economy will undermine\r\n  internal social cohesion. Because of low world oil prices and the\r\n  Asian crisis, growth in 1999 is expected to be moderate.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$5.4 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: -1% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$17,000 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 5%\r\n  industry: 46%\r\n  services: 49% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 2% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 144,000 (1995 est.);

Bulgaria fought on the losing\r\n  side in both World Wars. After World War II it fell within the\r\n  Soviet sphere of influence.

The triple digit inflation of\r\n  1996 and 1997 has given way to an official consumer price increase\r\n  of 1% in 1998. Following declines in GDP in both 1996 and 1997, the\r\n  economy grew an officially estimated 4% in 1998. In September 1998,\r\n  the IMF approved a three-year Extended Fund Facility, which provides\r\n  credits worth approximately $864 million, designed to support\r\n  Bulgaria's reform efforts. The government's structural reform\r\n  program includes: (a) privatization and, where appropriate,\r\n  liquidation of state-owned enterprises (SOEs); (b) liberalization of\r\n  agricultural policies, including creating conditions for the\r\n  development of a land market; (c) reform of the country's social\r\n  insurance programs; and, (d) reforms to strengthen contract\r\n  enforcement and fight crime and corruption.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$33.6 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 4% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$4,100 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 26%\r\n  industry: 29%\r\n  services: 45% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 3.3%\r\n  highest 10%: 24.7% (1992)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 1% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 3.57 million (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: NA\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 12.2% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $4.1 billion\r\n  expenditures: $3.8 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: machine building and metal working, food processing,\r\n  chemicals, textiles, construction materials, ferrous and nonferrous\r\n  metals\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 41.575 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 51.17%\r\n  hydro: 6.1%\r\n  nuclear: 42.73%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 41.08 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 2.045 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 1.55 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: grain, oilseed, vegetables, fruits,\r\n  tobacco;

Government policy in the last 10\r\n  years, 1989-98, has aimed at revitalizing the economy after three\r\n  decades of tight central planning. Thus, private activity has\r\n  markedly increased; foreign investment has been encouraged, so far\r\n  with moderate success; and efforts continue to increase the\r\n  efficiency of state enterprises. Published estimates of Burma's\r\n  foreign trade are greatly understated because of the volume of\r\n  black-market trade. A major ongoing problem is the failure to\r\n  achieve monetary and fiscal stability. Although Burma remains a poor\r\n  Asian country, its rich resources furnish the potential for\r\n  substantial long-term increases in income, exports, and living\r\n  standards. The short-term outlook is for continued sluggish growth\r\n  because of internal unrest, minimal foreign investment, and the\r\n  large trade deficit.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$56.1 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 1.1% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$1,200 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 59%\r\n  industry: 11%\r\n  services: 30% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 50% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 18.8 million (FY95/96 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture 65.2%, industry 14.3%,\r\n  trade 10.1%, government 6.3%, other 4.1% (FY88/89 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $7.9 billion\r\n  expenditures: $12.2 billion, including capital expenditures of $5.7\r\n  billion (FY96/97)\r\n\r\nIndustries: agricultural processing;

In a series of waves since October 1993,\r\n  hundreds of thousands of refugees have fled the ethnic violence\r\n  between the Hutu and Tutsi factions in Burundi and have crossed into\r\n  Rwanda, Tanzania, and Zaire (now called the Democratic Republic of\r\n  the Congo or DROC). Since October 1996, an estimated 120,000\r\n  Burundian Hutu refugees from the DROC have been compelled to return\r\n  to Burundi because of insecurity in the region. Continuing ethnic\r\n  violence with the Tutsi has caused additional Hutu to flee to\r\n  Tanzania, thus raising their numbers in the United Nations Office of\r\n  the High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) camps in that country to\r\n  about 260,000. Burundian troops have joined armies from Rwanda and\r\n  Uganda and Congolese Tutsi in trying to overthrow DROC President\r\n  KABILA and restore security to their borders with the Democratic\r\n  Republic of the Congo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeography\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: Central Africa, east of Democratic Republic of the Congo\r\n\r\nGeographic coordinates: 3 30 S, 30 00 E\r\n\r\nMap references: Africa\r\n\r\nArea:\r\n  total: 27,830 sq km\r\n  land: 25,650 sq km\r\n  water: 2,180 sq km\r\n\r\nArea--comparative: slightly smaller than Maryland\r\n\r\nLand boundaries:\r\n  total: 974 km\r\n  border countries: Democratic Republic of the Congo 233 km, Rwanda\r\n  290 km, Tanzania 451 km\r\n\r\nCoastline: 0 km (landlocked)\r\n\r\nMaritime claims: none (landlocked)\r\n\r\nClimate: equatorial;

The economy is\r\n  predominately agricultural with roughly 90% of the population\r\n  dependent on subsistence agriculture. Its economic health depends on\r\n  the coffee crop, which accounts for 80% of foreign exchange\r\n  earnings. The ability to pay for imports therefore rests largely on\r\n  the vagaries of the climate and the international coffee market.\r\n  Since October 1993 the nation has suffered from massive ethnic-based\r\n  violence which has resulted in the death of perhaps 250,000 persons\r\n  and the displacement of about 800,000 others. Foods, medicines, and\r\n  electricity remain in short supply.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$4.1 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 4.5% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$740 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 58%\r\n  industry: 18%\r\n  services: 24% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: 36.2% (1990 est.)\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 17% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 1.9 million\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture 93%, government 4%,\r\n  industry and commerce 1.5%, services 1.5% (1983 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $NA\r\n  expenditures: $165 million, including capital expenditures of $42.6\r\n  million (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: light consumer goods such as blankets, shoes, soap;\r\n  assembly of imported components;

Foreign investment fell off, and tourism has declined\r\n  from 1996 levels. Also, in 1998 the main harvest was hit by drought.\r\n  The long-term development of the economy after decades of war\r\n  remains a daunting challenge. Human resource levels in the\r\n  population are low, particularly in the poverty-ridden countryside.\r\n  The almost total lack of basic infrastructure in the countryside\r\n  will continue to hinder development. Recurring political instability\r\n  and corruption within government discourage foreign investment and\r\n  delay foreign aid. Even so, growth may resume in 1999 at, say, 2%.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$7.8 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 0% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$700 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 51%\r\n  industry: 15%\r\n  services: 34% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 15% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 2.5 million to 3 million\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture 80% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $261 million\r\n  expenditures: $496 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: rice milling, fishing, wood and wood products,\r\n  rubber, cement, gem mining, textiles\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 7% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 195 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 61.54%\r\n  hydro: 38.46%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 195 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: rice, rubber, corn, vegetables\r\n\r\nExports: $736 million (f.o.b., 1997 est.)\r\n\r\nExports--commodities: timber, garments, rubber, soybeans, sesame\r\n\r\nExports--partners: Singapore, Japan, Thailand, Hong Kong,\r\n  Indonesia, Malaysia, US\r\n\r\nImports: $1.1 billion (f.o.b., 1997 est.)\r\n\r\nImports--commodities: cigarettes, gold, construction materials,\r\n  petroleum products, machinery, motor vehicles\r\n\r\nImports--partners: Singapore, Vietnam, Japan, Australia, Hong\r\n  Kong, Indonesia, Thailand\r\n\r\nDebt--external: $2.2 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nEconomic aid--recipient: $569.8 million (1995)\r\n\r\nCurrency: 1 new riel (CR) = 100 sen\r\n\r\nExchange rates: riels (CR) per US$1--3,772.0 (January 1999),\r\n  3,744.4 (1998), 2,946.3 (1997), 2,624.1 (1996), 2,450.8 (1995),\r\n  2,545.3 (1994)\r\n\r\nFiscal year: calendar year\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunications\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTelephones: 7,000 (1981 est.)\r\n\r\nTelephone system: adequate landline and/or cellular service in\r\n  Phnom Penh and other provincial cities;

Still, it faces\r\n  many of the serious problems facing other underdeveloped countries,\r\n  such as a top-heavy civil service and a generally unfavorable\r\n  climate for business enterprise. Since 1990, the government has\r\n  embarked on various IMF and World Bank programs designed to spur\r\n  business investment, increase efficiency in agriculture, improve\r\n  trade, and recapitalize the nation's banks. The government, however,\r\n  has failed to press forward vigorously with these programs.

Economically and technologically the nation has\r\n  developed in parallel with the US, its neighbor to the south across\r\n  an unfortified border. Its paramount political problem continues to\r\n  be the relationship of the province of Quebec, with its\r\n  French-speaking residents and unique culture, to the remainder of\r\n  the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeography\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: Northern North America, bordering the North Atlantic\r\n  Ocean and North Pacific Ocean, north of the conterminous US\r\n\r\nGeographic coordinates: 60 00 N, 95 00 W\r\n\r\nMap references: North America\r\n\r\nArea:\r\n  total: 9,976,140 sq km\r\n  land: 9,220,970 sq km\r\n  water: 755,170 sq km\r\n\r\nArea--comparative: slightly larger than the US\r\n\r\nLand boundaries:\r\n  total: 8,893 km\r\n  border countries: US 8,893 km (includes 2,477 km with Alaska)\r\n\r\nCoastline: 243,791 km\r\n\r\nMaritime claims:\r\n  continental shelf: 200 nm or to the edge of the continental margin\r\n  exclusive fishing zone: 200 nm\r\n  territorial sea: 12 nm\r\n\r\nClimate: varies from temperate in south to subarctic and arctic\r\n  in north\r\n\r\nTerrain: mostly plains with mountains in west and lowlands in\r\n  southeast\r\n\r\nElevation extremes:\r\n  lowest point: Atlantic Ocean 0 m\r\n  highest point: Mount Logan 5,950 m\r\n\r\nNatural resources: nickel, zinc, copper, gold, lead, molybdenum,\r\n  potash, silver, fish, timber, wildlife, coal, petroleum, natural gas\r\n\r\nLand use:\r\n  arable land: 5%\r\n  permanent crops: 0%\r\n  permanent pastures: 3%\r\n  forests and woodland: 54%\r\n  other: 38% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nIrrigated land: 7,100 sq km (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nNatural hazards: continuous permafrost in north is a serious\r\n  obstacle to development;

Real\r\n  rates of growth have averaged nearly 3.0% since 1993. Unemployment\r\n  is falling and government budget surpluses are being partially\r\n  devoted to reducing the large public sector debt. The 1989 US-Canada\r\n  Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and 1994 North American Free Trade\r\n  Agreement (NAFTA) (which included Mexico) have touched off a\r\n  dramatic increase in trade and economic integration with the US.\r\n  With its great natural resources, skilled labor force, and modern\r\n  capital plant Canada can anticipate solid economic prospects in the\r\n  future. The continuing constitutional impasse between English- and\r\n  French-speaking areas is raising the possibility of a split in the\r\n  federation, making foreign investors somewhat edgy.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$688.3 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 3% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$22,400 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 3%\r\n  industry: 31%\r\n  services: 66% (1998)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 2.8%\r\n  highest 10%: 23.8% (1994)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 0.9% (1998)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 15.8 million (1998)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: services 75%, manufacturing 16%,\r\n  construction 5%, agriculture 3%, other 1% (1997)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 7.8% (December 1998)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $121.3 billion\r\n  expenditures: $112.6 billion, including capital expenditures of $1.7\r\n  billion (1998)\r\n\r\nIndustries: processed and unprocessed minerals, food products,\r\n  wood and paper products, transportation equipment, chemicals, fish\r\n  products, petroleum and natural gas\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 0.8% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 549.162 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 20.34%\r\n  hydro: 63.59%\r\n  nuclear: 16.05%\r\n  other: 0.02% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 511.586 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 45.28 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 7.705 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: wheat, barley, oilseed, tobacco, fruits,\r\n  vegetables;

The economy is service-oriented,\r\n  with commerce, transport, and public services accounting for almost\r\n  70% of GDP. Although nearly 70% of the population lives in rural\r\n  areas, the share of agriculture in GDP in 1995 was only 8%, of which\r\n  fishing accounts for 1.5%. About 90% of food must be imported. The\r\n  fishing potential, mostly lobster and tuna, is not fully exploited.\r\n  Cape Verde annually runs a high trade deficit, financed by foreign\r\n  aid and remittances from emigrants; remittances constitute a\r\n  supplement to GDP of more than 20%. Economic reforms, launched by\r\n  the new democratic government in 1991, are aimed at developing the\r\n  private sector and attracting foreign investment to diversify the\r\n  economy. Prospects for 1999 depend heavily on the maintenance of aid\r\n  flows, remittances, and the momentum of the government's development\r\n  program.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$581 million (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 7% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$1,450 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 8%\r\n  industry: 18%\r\n  services: 74% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 4.3% (1998)\r\n\r\nLabor force: NA\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA %\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $188 million\r\n  expenditures: $228 million, including capital expenditures of $116\r\n  million (1996)\r\n\r\nIndustries: food and beverages, fish processing, shoes and\r\n  garments, salt mining, ship repair,\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 40 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 100%\r\n  hydro: 0%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 40 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: bananas, corn, beans, sweet potatoes,\r\n  sugarcane, coffee, peanuts;

Subsequent violence between\r\n  the government and rebel military groups over pay issues, living\r\n  conditions, and lack of opposition party representation in the\r\n  government, destroyed many businesses in the capital, reduced tax\r\n  revenues, and exacerbated the government's problems in meeting\r\n  expenses.

The agricultural sector generates half of GDP.\r\n  Timber has accounted for about 16% of export earnings and the\r\n  diamond industry for nearly 54%. Important constraints to economic\r\n  development include the CAR's landlocked position, a poor\r\n  transportation system, a largely unskilled work force, and a legacy\r\n  of misdirected macroeconomic policies. The 50% devaluation of the\r\n  currencies of 14 Francophone African nations on 12 January 1994 had\r\n  mixed effects on the CAR's economy. Diamond, timber, coffee, and\r\n  cotton exports increased, leading an estimated rise of GDP of 7% in\r\n  1994 and nearly 5% in 1995. Military rebellions and social unrest in\r\n  1996 were accompanied by widespread destruction of property and a\r\n  drop in GDP of 2%. Ongoing violence between the government and rebel\r\n  military groups over pay issues, living conditions, and political\r\n  representation has destroyed many businesses in the capital and\r\n  reduced tax revenues for the government. The IMF approved an\r\n  Extended Structure Adjustment Facility in 1998.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$5.5 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 5.5% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$1,640 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 53%\r\n  industry: 21%\r\n  services: 26% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 2.6% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: NA\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 6% (1993)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $638 million\r\n  expenditures: $1.9 billion, including capital expenditures of $888\r\n  million (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: diamond mining, sawmills, breweries, textiles,\r\n  footwear, assembly of bicycles and motorcycles\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 100 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 20%\r\n  hydro: 80%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 100 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: cotton, coffee, tobacco, manioc (tapioca),\r\n  yams, millet, corn, bananas; timber\r\n\r\nExports: $182 million (f.o.b., 1998)\r\n\r\nExports--commodities: diamonds, timber, cotton, coffee, tobacco\r\n\r\nExports--partners: Belgium-Luxembourg 36%, Cote d'Ivoire 5%, Spain\r\n  4%, Egypt 3%, France\r\n\r\nImports: $155 million (f.o.b., 1998)\r\n\r\nImports--commodities: food, textiles, petroleum products,\r\n  machinery, electrical equipment, motor vehicles, chemicals,\r\n  pharmaceuticals, consumer goods, industrial products\r\n\r\nImports--partners: France 30%, Cote d'Ivoire 18%, Cameroon 11%,\r\n  Germany 4%, Japan\r\n\r\nDebt--external: $930 million (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nEconomic aid--recipient: $172.2 million (1995); note?traditional\r\n  budget subsidies from France\r\n\r\nCurrency: 1 Communaute Financiere Africaine franc (CFAF) = 100\r\n  centimes\r\n\r\nExchange rates: Communaute Financiere Africaine francs (CFAF) per\r\n  US$1--560.01 (December 1998), 589.95 (1998), 583.67 (1997), 511.55\r\n  (1996), 499.15 (1995), 555.20 (1994)\r\n\r\nFiscal year: calendar year\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunications\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTelephones: 16,867 (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nTelephone system: fair system\r\n  domestic: network consists principally of microwave radio relay and\r\n  low-capacity, low-powered radiotelephone communication\r\n  international: satellite earth station--1 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean)\r\n\r\nRadio broadcast stations: AM 1, FM 3 (including Africa No. 1 and\r\n  R.

His\r\n  transitional government eventually suppressed or came to terms with\r\n  most political-military groups, settled the territorial dispute with\r\n  Libya on terms favorable to Chad, drafted a democratic constitution\r\n  which was ratified by popular referendum in 1996, held multiparty\r\n  national presidential elections in 1996 (DEBY won with 69% of the\r\n  vote), and held multiparty elections for the National Assembly in\r\n  1997 (DEBY's Patriotic Salvation Movement won a majority of the\r\n  seats). But by the end of 1998, DEBY was beset with numerous\r\n  problems including heavy casualties in the Democratic Republic of\r\n  the Congo where Chadian troops had been deployed to support\r\n  embattled President KABILA, a new rebellion in northern Chad, and\r\n  further delays in the Doba Basin oil project in the south.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeography\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: Central Africa, south of Libya\r\n\r\nGeographic coordinates: 15 00 N, 19 00 E\r\n\r\nMap references: Africa\r\n\r\nArea:\r\n  total: 1.284 million sq km\r\n  land: 1,259,200 sq km\r\n  water: 24,800 sq km\r\n\r\nArea--comparative: slightly more than three times the size of\r\n  California\r\n\r\nLand boundaries:\r\n  total: 5,968 km\r\n  border countries: Cameroon 1,094 km, Central African Republic 1,197\r\n  km, Libya 1,055 km, Niger 1,175 km, Nigeria 87 km, Sudan 1,360 km\r\n\r\nCoastline: 0 km (landlocked)\r\n\r\nMaritime claims: none (landlocked)\r\n\r\nClimate: tropical in south, desert in north\r\n\r\nTerrain: broad, arid plains in center, desert in north, mountains\r\n  in northwest, lowlands in south\r\n\r\nElevation extremes:\r\n  lowest point: Djourab Depression 160 m\r\n  highest point: Emi Koussi 3,415 m\r\n\r\nNatural resources: petroleum (unexploited but exploration under\r\n  way), uranium, natron, kaolin, fish (Lake Chad)\r\n\r\nLand use:\r\n  arable land: 3%\r\n  permanent crops: 0%\r\n  permanent pastures: 36%\r\n  forests and woodland: 26%\r\n  other: 35% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nIrrigated land: 140 sq km (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nNatural hazards: hot, dry, dusty harmattan winds occur in north;\r\n  periodic droughts; locust plagues\r\n\r\nEnvironment--current issues: inadequate supplies of potable water;\r\n  improper waste disposal in rural areas contributes to soil and water\r\n  pollution; desertification\r\n\r\nEnvironment--international agreements:\r\n  party to: Biodiversity, Climate Change, Desertification, Endangered\r\n  Species, Nuclear Test Ban, Ozone Layer Protection, Wetlands\r\n  signed, but not ratified: Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping\r\n\r\nGeography--note: landlocked; Lake Chad is the most significant\r\n  water body in the Sahel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPopulation: 7,557,436 (July 1999 est.)\r\n\r\nAge structure:\r\n  0-14 years: 44% (male 1,675,394; female 1,667,717)\r\n  15-64 years: 53% (male 1,953,251; female 2,034,883)\r\n  65 years and over: 3% (male 99,783; female 126,408) (1999 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation growth rate: 2.65% (1999 est.)\r\n\r\nBirth rate: 43.06 births/1,000 population (1999 est.)\r\n\r\nDeath rate: 16.57 deaths/1,000 population (1999 est.)\r\n\r\nNet migration rate: 0 migrant(s)/1,000 population (1999 est.)\r\n\r\nSex ratio:\r\n  at birth: 1.04 male(s)/female\r\n  under 15 years: 1 male(s)/female\r\n  15-64 years: 0.96 male(s)/female\r\n  65 years and over: 0.79 male(s)/female\r\n  total population: 0.97 male(s)/female (1999 est.)\r\n\r\nInfant mortality rate: 115.27 deaths/1,000 live births (1999 est.)\r\n\r\nLife expectancy at birth:\r\n  total population: 48.56 years\r\n  male: 46.13 years\r\n  female: 51.09 years (1999 est.)\r\n\r\nTotal fertility rate: 5.69 children born/woman (1999 est.)\r\n\r\nNationality:\r\n  noun: Chadian(s)\r\n  adjective: Chadian\r\n\r\nEthnic groups: Muslims (Arabs, Toubou, Hadjerai, Fulbe, Kotoko,\r\n  Kanembou, Baguirmi, Boulala, Zaghawa, and Maba), non-Muslims (Sara,\r\n  Ngambaye, Mbaye, Goulaye, Moundang, Moussei, Massa), nonindigenous\r\n  150,000 (of whom 1,000 are French)\r\n\r\nReligions: Muslim 50%, Christian 25%, indigenous beliefs (mostly\r\n  animism) 25%\r\n\r\nLanguages: French (official), Arabic (official), Sara and Sango\r\n  (in south), more than 100 different languages and dialects\r\n\r\nLiteracy:\r\n  definition: age 15 and over can read and write French or Arabic\r\n  total population: 48.1%\r\n  male: 62.1%\r\n  female: 34.7% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCountry name:\r\n  conventional long form: Republic of Chad\r\n  conventional short form: Chad\r\n  local long form: Republique du Tchad\r\n  local short form: Tchad\r\n\r\nData code: CD\r\n\r\nGovernment type: republic\r\n\r\nCapital: N'Djamena\r\n\r\nAdministrative divisions: 14 prefectures (prefectures,\r\n  singular--prefecture); Batha, Biltine, Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti,\r\n  Chari-Baguirmi, Guera, Kanem, Lac, Logone Occidental, Logone\r\n  Oriental, Mayo-Kebbi, Moyen-Chari, Ouaddai, Salamat, Tandjile\r\n\r\nIndependence: 11 August 1960 (from France)\r\n\r\nNational holiday: Independence Day, 11 August (1960)\r\n\r\nConstitution: 31 March 1995, passed by referendum\r\n\r\nLegal system: based on French civil law system and Chadian\r\n  customary law; does not accept compulsory ICJ jurisdiction\r\n\r\nSuffrage: 18 years of age; universal\r\n\r\nExecutive branch:\r\n  chief of state: President Lt.

About 85% of the population depends on\r\n  agriculture, including the herding of livestock. Of Africa's\r\n  Francophone countries, Chad benefited least from the 50% devaluation\r\n  of their currencies in January 1994. Financial aid from the World\r\n  Bank, the African Development Fund, and other sources is directed\r\n  largely at the improvement of agriculture, especially livestock\r\n  production. Lack of financing and low oil prices, however, are\r\n  stalling the development of an oil field in the Doba Basin and the\r\n  construction of a proposed oil pipeline through Cameroon.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$7.5 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 2.9% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$1,000 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 39%\r\n  industry: 15%\r\n  services: 46% (1997)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 15% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: NA\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture 85% (subsistence farming,\r\n  herding, and fishing)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $198 million\r\n  expenditures: $218 million, including capital expenditures of $146\r\n  million (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: cotton textiles, meat packing, beer brewing, natron\r\n  (sodium carbonate), soap, cigarettes, construction materials\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 5% (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 90 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 100%\r\n  hydro: 0%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 90 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: cotton, sorghum, millet, peanuts, rice,\r\n  potatoes, manioc (tapioca);

Civilian governments--which took over from the military in\r\n  March 1990--have continued to reduce the government's role in the\r\n  economy while shifting the emphasis of public spending toward social\r\n  programs. Growth in real GDP averaged more than 7.0% in 1991-1997\r\n  but fell to about half of that average in 1998 because of spillover\r\n  from the global financial crisis. Inflation has been on a downward\r\n  trend and hit a 60-year low in 1998. Chile's currency and foreign\r\n  reserves also are strong, as sustained foreign capital\r\n  inflows--including significant direct investment--have more than\r\n  offset current account deficits and public debt buy-backs. President\r\n  FREI, who took office in March 1994, has placed improving Chile's\r\n  education system and developing foreign export markets at the top of\r\n  his economic agenda. The Chilean economy remains largely dependent\r\n  on a few sectors--particularly copper mining, fishing, and forestry.\r\n  Success in meeting the government's goal of sustained annual\r\n  economic growth of 5% depends largely on world prices for these\r\n  commodities, continued foreign investor confidence, and the\r\n  government's ability to maintain a conservative fiscal stance. In\r\n  1996, Chile became an associate member of Mercosur and concluded a\r\n  free trade agreement with Canada.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$184.6 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 3.5% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$12,500 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 6%\r\n  industry: 33%\r\n  services: 61% (1997)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: 20.5% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 1.4%\r\n  highest 10%: 46.1% (1994)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 4.7% (1998)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 5.8 million (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: services 38.3% (includes government\r\n  12%), industry and commerce 33.8%, agriculture, forestry, and\r\n  fishing 19.2%, mining 2.3%, construction 6.4% (1990)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 6.4% (1998)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $17 billion\r\n  expenditures: $17 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: copper, other minerals, foodstuffs, fish processing,\r\n  iron and steel, wood and wood products, transport equipment, cement,\r\n  textiles\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: -1.1% (1998)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 35.81 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 41.89%\r\n  hydro: 58.11%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 35.81 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: wheat, corn, grapes, beans, sugar beets,\r\n  potatoes, fruit;

In the first half of\r\n  the 20th century, China continued to suffer from major famines,\r\n  civil unrest, military defeat, and foreign occupation. After World\r\n  War II, the Communists under MAO Zedong established a dictatorship\r\n  that, while ensuring China's autonomy, imposed strict controls over\r\n  all aspects of life and cost the lives of tens of millions of\r\n  people. After 1978, his successor DENG Xiaoping decentralized\r\n  economic decision making; output quadrupled in the next 20 years.\r\n  Political controls remain tight at the same time economic controls\r\n  have been weakening. Present issues are: incorporating Hong Kong\r\n  into the Chinese system; closing down inefficient state-owned\r\n  enterprises; modernizing the military; fighting corruption; and\r\n  providing support to tens of millions of displaced workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeography\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: Eastern Asia, bordering the East China Sea, Korea Bay,\r\n  Yellow Sea, and South China Sea, between North Korea and Vietnam\r\n\r\nGeographic coordinates: 35 00 N, 105 00 E\r\n\r\nMap references: Asia\r\n\r\nArea:\r\n  total: 9,596,960 sq km\r\n  land: 9,326,410 sq km\r\n  water: 270,550 sq km\r\n\r\nArea--comparative: slightly smaller than the US\r\n\r\nLand boundaries:\r\n  total: 22,143.34 km\r\n  border countries: Afghanistan 76 km, Bhutan 470 km, Burma 2,185 km,\r\n  Hong Kong 30 km, India 3,380 km, Kazakhstan 1,533 km, North Korea\r\n  1,416 km, Kyrgyzstan 858 km, Laos 423 km, Macau 0.34 km, Mongolia\r\n  4,673 km, Nepal 1,236 km, Pakistan 523 km, Russia (northeast) 3,605\r\n  km, Russia (northwest) 40 km, Tajikistan 414 km, Vietnam 1,281 km\r\n\r\nCoastline: 14,500 km\r\n\r\nMaritime claims:\r\n  contiguous zone: 24 nm\r\n  continental shelf: 200 nm or to the edge of the continental margin\r\n  territorial sea: 12 nm\r\n\r\nClimate: extremely diverse;

The result has been a\r\n  quadrupling of GDP since 1978. Agricultural output doubled in the\r\n  1980s, and industry also posted major gains, especially in coastal\r\n  areas near Hong Kong and opposite Taiwan, where foreign investment\r\n  helped spur output of both domestic and export goods. On the darker\r\n  side, the leadership has often experienced in its hybrid system the\r\n  worst results of socialism (bureaucracy, lassitude, corruption) and\r\n  of capitalism (windfall gains and stepped-up inflation). Beijing\r\n  thus has periodically backtracked, retightening central controls at\r\n  intervals. In late 1993 China's leadership approved additional\r\n  long-term reforms aimed at giving still more play to market-oriented\r\n  institutions and at strengthening the center's control over the\r\n  financial system; state enterprises would continue to dominate many\r\n  key industries in what was now termed \"a socialist market economy\".\r\n  In 1995-97 inflation dropped sharply, reflecting tighter monetary\r\n  policies and stronger measures to control food prices. At the same\r\n  time, the government struggled to (a) collect revenues due from\r\n  provinces, businesses, and individuals; (b) reduce corruption and\r\n  other economic crimes; and (c) keep afloat the large state-owned\r\n  enterprises, most of which had not participated in the vigorous\r\n  expansion of the economy and many of which had been losing the\r\n  ability to pay full wages and pensions. From 60 to 100 million\r\n  surplus rural workers are adrift between the villages and the\r\n  cities, many subsisting through part-time low-paying jobs. Popular\r\n  resistance, changes in central policy, and loss of authority by\r\n  rural cadres have weakened China's population control program, which\r\n  is essential to maintaining growth in living standards. Another\r\n  long-term threat to continued rapid economic growth is the\r\n  deterioration in the environment, notably air pollution, soil\r\n  erosion, and the steady fall of the water table especially in the\r\n  north. China continues to lose arable land because of erosion and\r\n  economic development. The next few years may witness increasing\r\n  tensions between a highly centralized political system and an\r\n  increasingly decentralized economic system. Economic growth probably\r\n  will slow to more moderate levels in 1999-2000.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$4.42 trillion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 7.8% (1998 est.)

The\r\n  Central Bank resorted to interest rate hikes and tight monetary\r\n  policy to defend the peso against pressure from Colombia's worsening\r\n  trade and fiscal deficits. President PASTRANA'S well-respected\r\n  financial team is working to deal with the myriad economic problems\r\n  the country faces, including the highest unemployment level in\r\n  decades and a fiscal deficit of close to 5% of GDP in 1998. The\r\n  government implemented austerity measures, declared emergency\r\n  measures to guard against a potential banking crisis resulting from\r\n  the country's economic slowdown, and is seeking international\r\n  assistance to fund a peace plan with the guerrillas. Guerrilla\r\n  violence and low world oil prices will likely continue to undermine\r\n  the economy in 1999.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$254.7 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 0.2% (1998)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$6,600 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 19%\r\n  industry: 26%\r\n  services: 55% (1996)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: 17.7% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 1%\r\n  highest 10%: 46.9% (1995)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 16.7% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 16.8 million (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: services 46%, agriculture 30%,\r\n  industry 24% (1990)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 15.7% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $26 billion (1996 est.)\r\n  expenditures: $30 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: textiles, food processing, oil, clothing and\r\n  footwear, beverages, chemicals, cement;

Most recently, in August\r\n  1997, the islands of Anjouan and Moheli declared their independence\r\n  from Comoros. An attempt in September 1997 by the government to\r\n  reestablish control over the rebellious islands by force failed, and\r\n  presently the Organization of African Unity is brokering\r\n  negotiations to effect a reconciliation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeography\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: Southern Africa, group of islands in the Mozambique\r\n  Channel, about two-thirds of the way between northern Madagascar and\r\n  northern Mozambique\r\n\r\nGeographic coordinates: 12 10 S, 44 15 E\r\n\r\nMap references: Africa\r\n\r\nArea:\r\n  total: 2,170 sq km\r\n  land: 2,170 sq km\r\n  water: 0 sq km\r\n\r\nArea--comparative: slightly more than 12 times the size of\r\n  Washington, DC\r\n\r\nLand boundaries: 0 km\r\n\r\nCoastline: 340 km\r\n\r\nMaritime claims:\r\n  exclusive economic zone: 200 nm\r\n  territorial sea: 12 nm\r\n\r\nClimate: tropical marine;

The low educational level of the labor force contributes\r\n  to a subsistence level of economic activity, high unemployment, and\r\n  a heavy dependence on foreign grants and technical assistance.\r\n  Agriculture, including fishing, hunting, and forestry, is the\r\n  leading sector of the economy. It contributes 40% to GDP, employs\r\n  80% of the labor force, and provides most of the exports.

The new government instituted a\r\n  tight fiscal policy that initially curbed inflation and currency\r\n  depreciation, but these small gains were quickly reversed when the\r\n  foreign-backed rebellion in the eastern part of the country began in\r\n  August 1998. The war has dramatically reduced government revenue,\r\n  and increased external debt. Foreign businesses have curtailed\r\n  operations due to uncertainty about the outcome of the conflict and\r\n  because of increased government harassment and restrictions. Poor\r\n  infrastructure, an uncertain legal framework, corruption, and lack\r\n  of transparency in government economic policy remain a brake on\r\n  investment and growth. A number of IMF and World Bank missions have\r\n  met with the new government to help it develop a coherent economic\r\n  plan but associated reforms are on hold.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$34.9 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: -3.5% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$710 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 59%\r\n  industry: 15%\r\n  services: 26% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 147% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 14.51 million (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture 65%, industry 16%,\r\n  services 19% (1991 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $269 million\r\n  expenditures: $244 million, including capital expenditures of $24\r\n  million (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: mining, mineral processing, consumer products\r\n  (including textiles, footwear, cigarettes, processed foods and\r\n  beverages), cement, diamonds\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 6.4 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 6.25%\r\n  hydro: 93.75%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 6.265 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 195 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 60 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: coffee, sugar, palm oil, rubber, tea,\r\n  quinine, cassava (tapioca), palm oil, bananas, root crops, corn,\r\n  fruits;

Oil has supplanted forestry as the mainstay of the\r\n  economy, providing a major share of government revenues and exports.\r\n  In the early 1980s, rapidly rising oil revenues enabled the\r\n  government to finance large-scale development projects with GDP\r\n  growth averaging 5% annually, one of the highest rates in Africa.\r\n  Subsequently, falling oil prices cut GDP growth by half. Moreover,\r\n  the government has mortgaged a substantial portion of its oil\r\n  earnings, contributing to the government's shortage of revenues. The\r\n  12 January 1994 devaluation of Franc Zone currencies by 50% resulted\r\n  in inflation of 61% in 1994 but inflation has subsided since.\r\n  Economic reform efforts continued with the support of international\r\n  organizations, notably the World Bank and the IMF. The reform\r\n  program came to a halt in June 1997 when civil war erupted. Denis\r\n  SASSOU-NGUESSO, who returned to power when the war ended in October\r\n  1997, publicly expressed interest in moving forward on economic\r\n  reforms and privatization and in renewing cooperation with\r\n  international financial institutions. However, economic progress was\r\n  badly hurt by slumping oil prices in 1998, which worsened the\r\n  Republic of the Congo's budget deficit. A second blow was the\r\n  resumption of armed conflict in December 1998.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$3.9 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 2.5% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$1,500 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 10%\r\n  industry: 59%\r\n  services: 31% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 5% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: NA\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $870 million\r\n  expenditures: $970 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: petroleum extraction, cement kilning, lumbering,\r\n  brewing, sugar milling, palm oil, soap, cigarette making\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 438 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 0.68%\r\n  hydro: 99.32%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 553 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 115 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: cassava (tapioca), sugar, rice, corn,\r\n  peanuts, vegetables, coffee, cocoa; forest products\r\n\r\nExports: $1.7 billion (f.o.b., 1997)\r\n\r\nExports--commodities: petroleum 50%, lumber, plywood, sugar,\r\n  cocoa, coffee, diamonds\r\n\r\nExports--partners: US 37%, Belgium-Luxembourg 34%, Taiwan, China\r\n  (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nImports: $803 million (f.o.b. 1997)\r\n\r\nImports--commodities: intermediate manufactures, capital\r\n  equipment, construction materials, foodstuffs, petroleum products\r\n\r\nImports--partners: France 22%, Italy 16%, US 9%, UK 6% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nDebt--external: $6 billion (1996)\r\n\r\nEconomic aid--recipient: $159.1 million (1995)\r\n\r\nCurrency: 1 Communaute Financiere Africaine franc (CFAF) = 100\r\n  centimes\r\n\r\nExchange rates: Communaute Financiere Africaine francs (CFAF) per\r\n  US$1--550 (January 1999), 589.95 (1998), 583.67 (1997), 511.55\r\n  (1996), 499.15 (1995), 555.20 (1994)\r\n\r\nFiscal year: calendar year\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunications\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTelephones: 18,000 (1983 est.)\r\n\r\nTelephone system: services barely adequate for government use;\r\n  key exchanges are in Brazzaville, Pointe-Noire, and Loubomo;\r\n  inter-city lines frequently out-of-order\r\n  domestic: primary network consists of microwave radio relay and\r\n  coaxial cable\r\n  international: satellite earth station--1 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean)\r\n\r\nRadio broadcast stations: AM 4, FM 1, shortwave 0\r\n\r\nRadios: NA\r\n\r\nTelevision broadcast stations: 1 (1997)\r\n\r\nTelevisions: 8,500 (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTransportation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRailways:\r\n  total: 795 km (includes 285 km private track)\r\n  narrow gauge: 795 km 1.067-m gauge (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nHighways:\r\n  total: 12,800 km\r\n  paved: 1,242 km\r\n  unpaved: 11,558 km (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nWaterways: the Congo and Ubangi (Oubangui) Rivers provide 1,120\r\n  km of commercially navigable water transport; other rivers are used\r\n  for local traffic only\r\n\r\nPipelines: crude oil 25 km\r\n\r\nPorts and harbors: Brazzaville, Impfondo, Ouesso, Oyo,\r\n  Pointe-Noire\r\n\r\nAirports: 36 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nAirports--with paved runways:\r\n  total: 4\r\n  over 3,047 m: 1\r\n  1,524 to 2,437 m: 3 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nAirports--with unpaved runways:\r\n  total: 32\r\n  1,524 to 2,437 m: 8\r\n  914 to 1,523 m: 14\r\n  under 914 m: 10 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMilitary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMilitary branches: NA\r\n\r\nMilitary manpower--military age: 20 years of age\r\n\r\nMilitary manpower--availability:\r\n  males age 15-49: 641,543 (1999 est.)\r\n\r\nMilitary manpower--fit for military service:\r\n  males age 15-49: 326,834 (1999 est.)\r\n\r\nMilitary manpower--reaching military age annually:\r\n  males: 28,976 (1999 est.)\r\n\r\nMilitary expenditures--dollar figure: $110 million (1993)\r\n\r\nMilitary expenditures--percent of GDP: 3.8% (1993)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTransnational Issues\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDisputes--international: most of the Congo River boundary with the\r\n  Democratic Republic of the Congo is indefinite (no agreement has\r\n  been reached on the division of the river or its islands, except in\r\n  the Stanley Pool/Pool Malebo area)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n======================================================================\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n@Cook Islands\r\n------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBackground: Named after Captain Cook, who sighted them in 1770,\r\n  the islands became a British protectorate in 1888.

Agriculture provides the economic base with major\r\n  exports made up of copra and citrus fruit. Manufacturing activities\r\n  are limited to fruit-processing, clothing, and handicrafts. Trade\r\n  deficits are made up for by remittances from emigrants and by\r\n  foreign aid, overwhelmingly from New Zealand. In 1996, the\r\n  government declared bankruptcy, citing a $120 million public debt.\r\n  Efforts to exploit tourism potential and expanding the mining and\r\n  fishing industries have not been enough to adequately deal with the\r\n  financial crisis. In an effort to stem further erosion of the\r\n  economy, the government slashed public service salaries by 50%,\r\n  condensed the number of government ministries from 52 to 22, reduced\r\n  the number of civil servants by more than half, began selling\r\n  government assets, and closed all overseas diplomatic posts except\r\n  for the one in New Zealand.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$79 million (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$4,000 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 17%\r\n  industry: 6%\r\n  services: 77% (FY90/91)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 2.6% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 6,601 (1993)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture 29%, government 27%,\r\n  services 25%, industry 15%, other 4% (1981)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $NA\r\n  expenditures: $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n\r\nIndustries: fruit processing, tourism\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 15 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 100%\r\n  hydro: 0%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 15 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: copra, citrus, pineapples, tomatoes, beans,\r\n  pawpaws, bananas, yams, taro, coffee\r\n\r\nExports: $4.2 million (f.o.b., 1994 est.)\r\n\r\nExports--commodities: copra, fresh and canned citrus fruit,\r\n  coffee;

Economic growth has rebounded\r\n  from -0.9% in 1996 to 3% in 1997 and an estimated 5.5% in 1998.\r\n  Inflation rose to 22.5% in 1995, dropped to 11.1% in 1997, and\r\n  reached an estimated 12% in 1998. Unemployment appears moderate at\r\n  5.6%, but substantial underemployment continues. Furthermore, large\r\n  government deficits--fueled by interest payments on the massive\r\n  internal debt--have undermined efforts to maintain the quality of\r\n  social services. Curbing inflation, reducing the deficit, and\r\n  improving public sector efficiency remain key challenges to the\r\n  government. President RODRIGUEZ has called for an increased economic\r\n  role for the private sector, but political resistance to\r\n  privatization has stalled much of his economic program.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$24 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 5.5% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$6,700 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 15%\r\n  industry: 24%\r\n  services: 61% (1997)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 1.3%\r\n  highest 10%: 34.7% (1996)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 12% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 868,300\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: industry and commerce 23.3%,\r\n  government and services 55.1%, agriculture 21.6% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 5.6% (1998 est.);

After several years of lagging\r\n  performance, the Ivorian economy began a comeback in 1994, due to\r\n  the devaluation of the CFA franc and improved prices for cocoa and\r\n  coffee, growth in nontraditional primary exports such as pineapples\r\n  and rubber, limited trade and banking liberalization, offshore oil\r\n  and gas discoveries, and generous external financing and debt\r\n  rescheduling by multilateral lenders and France. The 50% devaluation\r\n  of Franc Zone currencies on 12 January 1994 caused a one-time jump\r\n  in the inflation rate to 26% in 1994, but the rate fell sharply in\r\n  1996-98. Moreover, government adherence to donor-mandated reforms\r\n  led to a jump in growth to 6% annually in 1996-98. Growth may slow\r\n  in 1999-2000 because of the difficulty of meeting the conditions of\r\n  international donors and continued low prices of key exports.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$24.2 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 6% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$1,680 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 31%\r\n  industry: 20%\r\n  services: 49% (1995)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 2.8%\r\n  highest 10%: 28.5% (1988)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 6% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: NA\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $2.3 billion\r\n  expenditures: $2.6 billion, including capital expenditures of $640\r\n  million (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: foodstuffs, beverages;

Croatia faces considerable economic\r\n  problems stemming from: the legacy of longtime communist\r\n  mismanagement of the economy; damage during the internecine fighting\r\n  to bridges, factories, power lines, buildings, and houses; the large\r\n  refugee and displaced population, both Croatian and Bosnian; and the\r\n  disruption of economic ties. Western aid and investment, especially\r\n  in the tourist and oil industries, would help restore the economy.\r\n  The government has been successful in some reform efforts--partially\r\n  macroeconomic stabilization policies--and it has normalized relations\r\n  with its creditors. Yet it still is struggling with privatization of\r\n  large state enterprises and with bank reform. In 1998, Croatia made\r\n  progress in reducing its current account deficit to about 8% of GDP\r\n  from 12% the previous year. Economic growth continues to lag,\r\n  however, and growing levels of inter-enterprise debt plague the\r\n  domestic economy. Four commercial banks were put under government\r\n  control and a major conglomerate is teetering on collapse.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$23.6 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 3% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$5,100 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 12%\r\n  industry: 24%\r\n  services: 64% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 5.4% (1998)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 1.63 million (1998)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: industry and mining 31.1%, agriculture\r\n  4.3%, government 19.1% (including education and health), other 45.5%\r\n  (1993)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 18.6% (yearend 1998)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $5.3 billion\r\n  expenditures: $6.3 billion, including capital expenditures of $78.5\r\n  million (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: chemicals and plastics, machine tools, fabricated\r\n  metal, electronics, pig iron and rolled steel products, aluminum,\r\n  paper, wood products, construction materials, textiles,\r\n  shipbuilding, petroleum and petroleum refining, food and beverages;\r\n  tourism\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 3.7% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 10.682 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 29.25%\r\n  hydro: 70.75%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 14.632 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 1 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 4.95 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: wheat, corn, sugar beets, sunflower seed,\r\n  alfalfa, clover, olives, citrus, grapes, vegetables;

At home, Havana provided Cubans with high\r\n  levels of healthcare, education, and social security while\r\n  suppressing the Roman Catholic Church and arresting political\r\n  dissidents.

The government has\r\n  undertaken several reforms in recent years to stem excess liquidity,\r\n  increase labor incentives, and alleviate serious shortages of food,\r\n  consumer goods, and services. The liberalized agricultural markets\r\n  introduced in October 1994, at which state and private farmers sell\r\n  above-quota production at unrestricted prices, have broadened legal\r\n  consumption alternatives and reduced black market prices. Government\r\n  efforts to lower subsidies to unprofitable enterprises and to shrink\r\n  the money supply caused the semi-official exchange rate for the\r\n  Cuban peso to move from a peak of 120 to the dollar in the summer of\r\n  1994 to 21 to the dollar by yearend 1998. New taxes introduced in\r\n  1996 helped drive down the number of self-employed workers from\r\n  208,000 in January 1996 to 155,000 by July 1998. Havana announced in\r\n  1995 that GDP declined by 35% during 1989-93, the result of lost\r\n  Soviet aid and domestic inefficiencies. The drop in GDP apparently\r\n  halted in 1994, when Cuba reported 0.7% growth, followed by\r\n  increases of 2.5% in 1995 and 7.8% in 1996. Growth slowed again in\r\n  1997 and 1998 to 2.5% and 1.2% respectively. Export earnings\r\n  declined 22% in 1998, to $1.4 billion, the result of lower sugar\r\n  export volume and lower world prices for nickel and sugar. Import\r\n  expenditures also fell 15% to $3.0 billion, in part due to lower\r\n  world oil prices. Tourism and remittances play a key role in foreign\r\n  currency earnings. Living standards for the average Cuban remain at\r\n  a depressed level compared with 1990.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$17.3 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 1.2% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$1,560 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 7.4%\r\n  industry: 36.5%\r\n  services: 56.1% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): NA%\r\n\r\nLabor force: 4.5 million economically active population (1996\r\n  est.)\r\n  note: state sector 76%, non-state sector 24% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: services and government 30%, industry\r\n  22%, agriculture 20%, commerce 11%, construction 10%, transportation\r\n  and communications 7% (June 1990)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 6.8% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $12.3 billion\r\n  expenditures: $13 billion , including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: sugar, petroleum, food, tobacco, textiles, chemicals,\r\n  paper and wood products, metals (particularly nickel), cement,\r\n  fertilizers, consumer goods, agricultural machinery\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 6% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 14.1 billion kWh (1997)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 98.96%\r\n  hydro: 1.04%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 14.1 billion kWh (1997)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: sugarcane, tobacco, citrus, coffee, rice,\r\n  potatoes, beans;

The Greek Cypriot economy is prosperous but highly susceptible\r\n  to external shocks. Erratic growth rates in the 1990s reflect the\r\n  economy's vulnerability to swings in tourist arrivals, caused by\r\n  political instability on the island and fluctuations in economic\r\n  conditions in Western Europe. Economic policy in the south is\r\n  focused on meeting the criteria for admission to the EU. As in the\r\n  Turkish sector, water shortage is a growing problem, and several\r\n  desalination plants are planned. The Turkish Cypriot economy has\r\n  about one-fifth the population and one-third the per capita GDP of\r\n  the south. Because it is recognized only by Turkey, it has had much\r\n  difficulty arranging foreign financing, and foreign firms have\r\n  hesitated to invest there. The economy remains heavily dependent on\r\n  agriculture and government service, which together employ about half\r\n  of the work force. Moreover, the small, vulnerable economy has\r\n  suffered because the Turkish lira is legal tender. To compensate for\r\n  the economy's weakness, Turkey provides direct and indirect aid to\r\n  nearly every sector, e.g. tourism, education, and industry.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$10 billion (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 2.3% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$13,000 (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector: Greek Cypriot area: agriculture 4.4%;\r\n  industry 22.4%;

Independence ended with the German\r\n  takeover in 1939. After World War II, Czechoslovakia fell within the\r\n  Soviet sphere of influence, and in 1968 an invasion by Warsaw Pact\r\n  troops snuffed out anti-communist demonstrations and riots. With the\r\n  collapse of Soviet authority in 1991, Czechoslovakia regained its\r\n  freedom. On 1 January 1993, the country peacefully split into its\r\n  two ethnic components, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The Czech\r\n  Republic, largely by aspiring to become a NATO and EU member, has\r\n  moved toward integration in world markets, a development that poses\r\n  both opportunities and risks. But Prague has had a difficult time\r\n  convincing the public that membership in NATO is crucial to Czech\r\n  security. At the same time, support for eventual EU membership is\r\n  waning. Coupled with the country's worsening economic situation,\r\n  Prague's political scene, troubled for the past three years, will\r\n  remain so for the foreseeable future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeography\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: Central Europe, southeast of Germany\r\n\r\nGeographic coordinates: 49 45 N, 15 30 E\r\n\r\nMap references: Europe\r\n\r\nArea:\r\n  total: 78,703 sq km\r\n  land: 78,645 sq km\r\n  water: 58 sq km\r\n\r\nArea--comparative: slightly smaller than South Carolina\r\n\r\nLand boundaries:\r\n  total: 1,881 km\r\n  border countries: Austria 362 km, Germany 646 km, Poland 658 km,\r\n  Slovakia 215 km\r\n\r\nCoastline: 0 km (landlocked)\r\n\r\nMaritime claims: none (landlocked)\r\n\r\nClimate: temperate;

Delays in enterprise\r\n  restructuring and failure to develop a well-functioning capital\r\n  market played major roles in Czech economic troubles, which\r\n  culminated in a currency crisis in May. The currency was forced out\r\n  of its fluctuation band as investors worried that the current\r\n  account deficit, which reached nearly 8% of GDP in 1996, would\r\n  become unsustainable. After expending $3 billion in vain to support\r\n  the currency, the central bank let it float. The growing current\r\n  account imbalance reflected a surge in domestic demand and poor\r\n  export performance, as wage increases outpaced productivity. The\r\n  government was forced to introduce two austerity packages later in\r\n  the spring which cut government spending by 2.5% of GDP. A tough\r\n  1998 budget continued the painful medicine. These problems were\r\n  compounded in the summer of 1997 by unprecedented flooding which\r\n  inundated much of the eastern part of the country. Czech\r\n  difficulties contrast with earlier achievements of strong GDP\r\n  growth, a balanced budget, and inflation and unemployment that were\r\n  among the lowest in the region. The Czech economy's transition\r\n  problems continue to be too much direct and indirect government\r\n  influence on the privatized economy, the sometimes ineffective\r\n  management of privatized firms, and a shortage of experienced\r\n  financial analysts for the banking system. The country slipped into\r\n  a mild recession in 1998, but hopes to rebound with 1% growth in\r\n  1999.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$116.7 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: -1.5% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$11,300 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 5%\r\n  industry: 33.8%\r\n  services: 61.2% (1996)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 4.6%\r\n  highest 10%: 23.5% (1993)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 10.7% (1998)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 3.655 million (1998)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: industry 33.1%, agriculture 6.9%,\r\n  construction 9.1%, transport and communications 7.2%, services 43.7%\r\n  (1994)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 7% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $16.1 billion\r\n  expenditures: $16.6 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1997)\r\n\r\nIndustries: fuels, ferrous metallurgy, machinery and equipment,\r\n  coal, motor vehicles, glass, armaments\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 6.7% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 60.214 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 76.69%\r\n  hydro: 3.04%\r\n  nuclear: 20.27%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 60.164 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 8.8 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 8.75 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: grains, potatoes, sugar beets, hops, fruit;\r\n  pigs, cattle, poultry;

The coalition\r\n  has lowered marginal income taxes while maintaining overall tax\r\n  revenues; boosted industrial competitiveness through labor market\r\n  and tax reforms and increased research and development funds; and\r\n  improved welfare services for the neediest while cutting paperwork\r\n  and delays.

Two-thirds of the inhabitants live\r\n  in the capital city, the remainder being mostly nomadic herders.\r\n  Scanty rainfall limits crop production to fruits and vegetables, and\r\n  most food must be imported. Djibouti provides services as both a\r\n  transit port for the region and an international transshipment and\r\n  refueling center. It has few natural resources and little industry.\r\n  The nation is, therefore, heavily dependent on foreign assistance to\r\n  help support its balance of payments and to finance development\r\n  projects. An unemployment rate of 40% to 50% continues to be a major\r\n  problem. Per capita consumption dropped an estimated 35% over the\r\n  last seven years because of recession, civil war, and a high\r\n  population growth rate (including immigrants and refugees). Also,\r\n  renewed fighting between Ethiopia and Eritrea has disturbed normal\r\n  external channels of commerce. Faced with a multitude of economic\r\n  difficulties, the government has fallen in arrears on long-term\r\n  external debt and has been struggling to meet the stipulations of\r\n  foreign aid donors.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$530 million (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 0.6% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$1,200 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 3%\r\n  industry: 20%\r\n  services: 77% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 3% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 282,000\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture 75%, industry 11%,\r\n  services 14% (1991 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 40%-50% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $156 million\r\n  expenditures: $175 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: limited to a few small-scale enterprises, such as\r\n  dairy products and mineral-water bottling\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 3% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 175 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 100%\r\n  hydro: 0%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 175 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: fruits, vegetables;

Development of the tourist industry remains\r\n  difficult because of the rugged coastline, lack of beaches, and the\r\n  lack of an international airport. Hurricane Luis devastated the\r\n  country's banana crop in September 1995; tropical storms had wiped\r\n  out one-quarter of the crop in 1994 as well. The economy began to\r\n  recover in mid-1998, fueled by increases in construction, soap\r\n  production, and tourist arrivals. The government is attempting to\r\n  develop an offshore financial industry in order to diversify the\r\n  island's production base.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$216 million (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 1.8% (1997)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$3,300 (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 20%\r\n  industry: 16%\r\n  services: 64% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 2.2% (1997)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 25,000\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture 40%, industry and commerce\r\n  32%, services 28%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 15% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $72 million\r\n  expenditures: $79.9 million, including capital expenditures of $11.5\r\n  million (FY97/98)\r\n\r\nIndustries: soap, coconut oil, tourism, copra, furniture, cement\r\n  blocks, shoes\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: -10% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 40 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 50%\r\n  hydro: 50%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 40 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: bananas, citrus, mangoes, root crops,\r\n  coconuts;

Because the country exports primary products\r\n  such as oil, bananas, and shrimp, fluctuations in world market\r\n  prices can have a substantial domestic impact. Ecuador joined the\r\n  World Trade Organization in 1996, but has failed to comply with many\r\n  of its accession commitments. In recent years, growth has been\r\n  uneven due to ill-conceived fiscal stabilization measures. The\r\n  populist government of Abdala BUCARAM Ortiz proposed a major\r\n  currency reform in 1996, but popular discontent with BUCARAM'S\r\n  austerity measures and rampant official corruption led to his\r\n  replacement by National Congress with Fabian ALARCON in February\r\n  1997. ALARCON adopted a minimalist economic program that put off\r\n  necessary reforms until August 1998 when President Jamil MAHUAD was\r\n  elected. MAHAUD inherited an economy in crisis due to mismanagement,\r\n  El Nino damage to key export sectors such as agriculture, and low\r\n  world commodity prices in the wake of the Asian financial crisis.\r\n  MAHAUD announced a fiscal austerity package and expressed interest\r\n  in an IMF agreement but faces major difficulties in promoting\r\n  economic growth, including possible political objections to further\r\n  reform.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$58.7 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 1% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$4,800 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 12%\r\n  industry: 37%\r\n  services: 51% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: 35% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 2.3%\r\n  highest 10%: 37.6% (1994)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 43% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 4.2 million\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture 29%, manufacturing 18%,\r\n  commerce 15%, services and other activities 38% (1990)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 12% with widespread underemployment (November\r\n  1998 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: planned $5.1 billion not including revenue from potential\r\n  privatizations\r\n  expenditures: $5.1 billion (1999)\r\n\r\nIndustries: petroleum, food processing, textiles, metal work,\r\n  paper products, wood products, chemicals, plastics, fishing, lumber\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 2.4% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 8.45 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 17.16%\r\n  hydro: 82.84%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 8.45 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: bananas, coffee, cocoa, rice, potatoes,\r\n  manioc (tapioca), plantains, sugarcane;

For the last\r\n  two millennia, however, Egypt has served a series of foreign\r\n  masters--Persians, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Arabs, Turks, and the\r\n  British.

In the face of these\r\n  pressures, in 1991 Egypt undertook wide-ranging macroeconomic\r\n  stabilization and structural reform measures. This reform effort has\r\n  been supported by three IMF arrangements, the last of which expired\r\n  in September 1998. Egypt's reform efforts--and its participation in\r\n  the Gulf war coalition--also led to massive debt relief under the\r\n  Paris Club arrangements. Substantial progress has been made in\r\n  improving macroeconomic performance. Cairo tamed inflation, slashed\r\n  budget deficits, and built up foreign reserves to an all-time high.\r\n  Although the pace of structural reforms--such as privatization and\r\n  new business legislation--has been slower than envisioned under the\r\n  IMF program, Egypt's steps toward a more market-oriented economy\r\n  have prompted increased foreign investment. The November 1997\r\n  massacre of foreign tourists in Luxor affected tourism enough to\r\n  slow the GDP growth rate for 1998 compared to earlier projections.\r\n  Tourism's slow recovery, coupled with low world oil prices, caused a\r\n  downturn in foreign exchange earnings in 1998, but external payments\r\n  are not in crisis.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$188 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 5% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$2,850 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 16%\r\n  industry: 31%\r\n  services: 53% (1997)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 3.9%\r\n  highest 10%: 26.7% (1991)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 3.6% (1998)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 17.4 million (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture 40%, services, including\r\n  government 38%, industry 22% (1990 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 10% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $20 billion\r\n  expenditures: $20.8 billion, including capital expenditures of $4.4\r\n  billion (FY97/98)\r\n\r\nIndustries: textiles, food processing, tourism, chemicals,\r\n  petroleum, construction, cement, metals\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 9.4% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 46 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 76.09%\r\n  hydro: 23.91%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 46 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: cotton, rice, corn, wheat, beans, fruits,\r\n  vegetables;

Several large oil companies are expected to bid on oil\r\n  licenses by May 1999. Forestry, farming, and fishing are also major\r\n  components of GDP. Subsistence farming predominates. Although\r\n  pre-independence Equatorial Guinea counted on cocoa production for\r\n  hard currency earnings, the deterioration of the rural economy under\r\n  successive brutal regimes has diminished potential for\r\n  agriculture-led growth. A number of aid programs sponsored by the\r\n  World Bank and the IMF have been cut off since 1993 because of the\r\n  government's gross corruption and mismanagement.

The economy is largely based on subsistence\r\n  agriculture, with over 70% of the population involved in farming and\r\n  herding. The small industrial sector consists mainly of light\r\n  industries with outmoded technologies. Domestic output (GDP) is\r\n  substantially augmented by worker remittances from abroad.\r\n  Government revenues come from custom duties and taxes on income and\r\n  sales. Road construction is a top domestic priority. Eritrea has\r\n  long-term prospects for revenues from the development of offshore\r\n  oil, offshore fishing, and tourism. Eritrea's economic future\r\n  depends on its ability to master fundamental social and economic\r\n  problems, e.g., overcoming illiteracy, promoting job creation,\r\n  expanding technical training, attracting foreign investment, and\r\n  streamlining the bureaucracy. The most immediate threat to the\r\n  economy, however, is the possible expansion of the armed conflict\r\n  with Ethiopia.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$2.5 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 5% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$660 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 18%\r\n  industry: 20%\r\n  services: 62% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 8% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: NA\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $226 million\r\n  expenditures: $453 million, including capital expenditures of $88\r\n  million (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: food processing, beverages, clothing and textiles\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: NA kWh\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: NA%\r\n  hydro: NA%\r\n  nuclear: NA%\r\n  other: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: NA kWh\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: NA kWh\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: NA kWh\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: sorghum, lentils, vegetables, maize,\r\n  cotton, tobacco, coffee, sisal; livestock, goats; fish\r\n\r\nExports: $95 million (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nExports--commodities: livestock, sorghum, textiles, food, small\r\n  manufactures\r\n\r\nExports--partners: Ethiopia 67%, Sudan 10%, US 8%, Italy 4%, Saudi\r\n  Arabia, Yemen (1996)\r\n\r\nImports: $514 million (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nImports--commodities: processed goods, machinery, petroleum\r\n  products\r\n\r\nImports--partners: Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia, Italy, United Arab\r\n  Emirates (1996)\r\n\r\nDebt--external: $46 million (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nEconomic aid--recipient: $149.9 million (1995)\r\n\r\nCurrency: 1 nafka = 100 cents\r\n\r\nExchange rates: nakfa per US$1 = 7.6 (January 1999), 7.2 (March\r\n  1998 est.)\r\n  note: following independence from Ethiopia, Eritrea continued to use\r\n  Ethiopian currency until November 1997 when Eritrea issued its own\r\n  currency, the nakfa, at approximately the same rate as the birr,\r\n  i.e., 7.2 nakfa per US$1\r\n\r\nFiscal year: calendar year\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunications\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTelephones: NA\r\n\r\nTelephone system:\r\n  domestic: very inadequate; about 4 telephones per 100 families, most\r\n  of which are in Asmara; government is seeking international tenders\r\n  to improve the system\r\n  international: NA\r\n\r\nRadio broadcast stations: AM 2, FM 0, shortwave 1\r\n\r\nRadios: NA\r\n\r\nTelevision broadcast stations: 1 (government controlled) (1997)\r\n\r\nTelevisions: NA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTransportation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRailways:\r\n  total: 307 km\r\n  narrow gauge: 307 km 0.950-m gauge (1995 est.)\r\n  note: nonoperational since 1978 except for about a 5 km stretch that\r\n  was reopened in Massawa in 1994; rehabilitation of the remainder and\r\n  of the rolling stock is under way; links Ak'ordat and Asmara\r\n  (formerly Asmera) with the port of Massawa (formerly Mits'iwa)\r\n\r\nHighways:\r\n  total: 4,010 km\r\n  paved: 874 km\r\n  unpaved: 3,136 km (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nPorts and harbors: Assab (Aseb), Massawa (Mits'iwa)\r\n\r\nMerchant marine:\r\n  total: 2 ships (1,000 GRT or over) totaling 5,947 GRT/5,747 DWT\r\n  ships by type: oil tanker 1, roll-on/roll-off cargo 1 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nAirports: 20 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nAirports--with paved runways:\r\n  total: 2\r\n  over 3,047 m: 1\r\n  2,438 to 3,047 m: 1 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nAirports--with unpaved runways:\r\n  total: 18\r\n  over 3,047 m: 2\r\n  2,438 to 3,047 m: 2\r\n  1,524 to 2,437 m: 5\r\n  914 to 1,523 m: 6\r\n  under 914 m: 3 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMilitary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMilitary branches: Army, Navy, Air Force\r\n\r\nMilitary expenditures--dollar figure: $196 million (1997)\r\n\r\nMilitary expenditures--percent of GDP: 28.6% (1997)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTransnational Issues\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDisputes--international: dispute over alignment of boundary with\r\n  Ethiopia led to armed conflict in 1998, which is still unresolved\r\n  despite arbitration efforts; Hanish Islands dispute with Yemen\r\n  resolved by arbitral tribunal in October 1998\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n======================================================================\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n@Estonia\r\n-------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBackground: In and out of Swedish and Russian control over the\r\n  centuries, this little Baltic state was re-incorporated into the\r\n  USSR after German occupation in World War II.

A high but\r\n  slightly decreased current account deficit was estimated at 8.6%.\r\n  The fall in GDP growth is largely due to the impact of Russia's\r\n  financial crisis and reduced investment in emerging markets in the\r\n  wake of the Asian financial crisis. Like other small emerging\r\n  markets, Estonia will face difficulties in 1999 as a result of\r\n  continuing fallout from Asia. Key events of 1998 were the start of\r\n  official EU accession talks, banking sector consolidation--nine banks\r\n  were reduced to five--and the important role that Swedish capital\r\n  played in the large banks (Swedbank's acquisition of a majority\r\n  stake in Hansapank has accounted for the large increase in foreign\r\n  direct investment). The IMF urged Estonia to maintain a stable\r\n  economy and good reputation in international markets and to avoid\r\n  populist policies in the run-up to March 1999 parliamentary\r\n  elections. The government completed restructuring of\r\n  state-controlled Estonian Telecom, the sale of 49% of which will be\r\n  the flagship privatization in 1999 and the largest public equity\r\n  transaction in the Baltics.

Its economy is based on agriculture, which\r\n  accounts for more than half of GDP, 90% of exports, and 80% of total\r\n  employment; coffee generates 60% of export earnings. The\r\n  agricultural sector suffers from frequent periods of drought, poor\r\n  cultivation practices, and deterioration of internal security\r\n  conditions. The manufacturing sector is heavily dependent on inputs\r\n  from the agricultural sector. Over 90% of large-scale industry, but\r\n  less than 10% of agriculture, is state-run. The government is\r\n  considering selling off a portion of state-owned plants and is\r\n  implementing reform measures that are gradually liberalizing the\r\n  economy. A major medium-term problem is the improvement of roads,\r\n  water supply, and other parts of an infrastructure badly neglected\r\n  during years of civil strife. Renewed fighting with Eritrea dims\r\n  economic prospects for 1999.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$32.9 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 6% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$560 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 55%\r\n  industry: 12%\r\n  services: 33% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 3.9% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: NA\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture and animal husbandry 80%,\r\n  government and services 12%, industry and construction 8% (1985)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $1 billion\r\n  expenditures: $1.48 billion, including capital expenditures of $415\r\n  million (FY96/97)\r\n\r\nIndustries: food processing, beverages, textiles, chemicals,\r\n  metals processing, cement\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 1.32 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 7.58%\r\n  hydro: 87.12%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 5.3% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 1.32 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: cereals, pulses, coffee, oilseed,\r\n  sugarcane, potatoes;

In 1987 the government began selling fishing\r\n  licenses to foreign trawlers operating within the Falklands\r\n  exclusive fishing zone. These license fees total more than $40\r\n  million per year, which goes to support the island's health,\r\n  education, and welfare system. Squid accounts for 75% of the fish\r\n  taken. Dairy farming supports domestic consumption; crops furnish\r\n  winter fodder. Exports feature shipments of high-grade wool to the\r\n  UK and the sale of postage stamps and coins. To encourage tourism,\r\n  the Falkland Islands Development Corporation has built three lodges\r\n  for visitors attracted by the abundant wildlife and trout fishing.\r\n  The islands are now self-financing except for defense. The British\r\n  Geological Survey announced a 200-mile oil exploration zone around\r\n  the islands in 1993, and early seismic surveys suggest substantial\r\n  reserves capable of producing 500,000 barrels per day; to date no\r\n  exploitable site has been identified. An agreement between Argentina\r\n  and the UK in 1995 seeks to defuse licensing and sovereignty\r\n  conflicts that would dampen foreign interest in exploiting potential\r\n  oil reserves.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$NA\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$NA\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NA%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): NA%\r\n\r\nLabor force: 1,100 (est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture 95% (mostly sheepherding\r\n  and fishing)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: full employment;

The Faroese hope to\r\n  broaden their economic base by building new fish-processing plants.\r\n  Oil finds close to the Faroese area give hope for deposits in the\r\n  immediate Faroese area, which may lay the basis for sustained\r\n  economic prosperity.

Sugar\r\n  exports and a growing tourist industry are the major sources of\r\n  foreign exchange. Sugar processing makes up one-third of industrial\r\n  activity. Roughly 250,000 tourists visit each year. Political\r\n  uncertainty and drought, however, contribute to substantial\r\n  fluctuations in earnings from tourism and sugar and to the\r\n  emigration of skilled workers. Fiji's growth slowed in 1997 because\r\n  the sugar industry suffered from low world prices and rent disputes\r\n  between farmers and landowners. Drought in 1998 further damaged the\r\n  sugar industry. Overall growth in 1991-98 has averaged less than 2%\r\n  per year, with long-term problems of low investment and uncertain\r\n  property rights. The central bank predicts growth of 2% to 3% in\r\n  1999.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$5.4 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 2.4% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$6,700 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 19%\r\n  industry: 22%\r\n  services: 59% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 3% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 235,000\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: subsistence agriculture 67%, wage\r\n  earners 18%, salary earners 15% (1987)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 6% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $540.65 million\r\n  expenditures: $742.65 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: sugar, tourism, copra, gold, silver, clothing,\r\n  lumber, small cottage industries\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 2.9% (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 545 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 21.1%\r\n  hydro: 78.9%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 545 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: sugarcane, coconuts, cassava (tapioca),\r\n  rice, sweet potatoes, bananas; cattle, pigs, horses, goats; fish\r\n\r\nExports: $655 million (f.o.b., 1996)\r\n\r\nExports--commodities: sugar 32%, clothing, gold, processed fish,\r\n  lumber\r\n\r\nExports--partners: Australia 27%, UK 14%, NZ 12%, US 8%, Japan\r\n  (1996)\r\n\r\nImports: $838 million (f.o.b., 1996)\r\n\r\nImports--commodities: machinery and transport equipment, petroleum\r\n  products, food, chemicals\r\n\r\nImports--partners: Australia 44%, NZ 15%, US 9%, Japan 5%,\r\n  Singapore 5% (1996)\r\n\r\nDebt--external: $217 million (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nEconomic aid--recipient: $40.3 million (1995)\r\n\r\nCurrency: 1 Fijian dollar (F$) = 100 cents\r\n\r\nExchange rates: Fijian dollars (F$) per US$1--1.9556 (January\r\n  1999), 1.9868 (1998), 1.4437 (1997), 1.4033 (1996), 1.4063 (1995),\r\n  1.4641 (1994)\r\n\r\nFiscal year: calendar year\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunications\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTelephones: 60,017 (1987 est.)\r\n\r\nTelephone system: modern local, interisland, and international\r\n  (wire/radio integrated) public and special-purpose telephone,\r\n  telegraph, and teleprinter facilities; regional radio communications\r\n  center\r\n  domestic: NA\r\n  international: access to important cable link between US and Canada\r\n  and NZ and Australia; satellite earth station--1 Intelsat (Pacific\r\n  Ocean)\r\n\r\nRadio broadcast stations: AM 7, FM 1, shortwave 0\r\n\r\nRadios: NA\r\n\r\nTelevision broadcast stations: 0\r\n\r\nTelevisions: 12,000 (1992 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTransportation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRailways:\r\n  total: 597 km; note--belongs to the government-owned Fiji Sugar\r\n  Corporation\r\n  narrow gauge: 597 km 0.610-m gauge (1995)\r\n\r\nHighways:\r\n  total: 3,440 km\r\n  paved: 1,692 km\r\n  unpaved: 1,748 km (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nWaterways: 203 km; 122 km navigable by motorized craft and\r\n  200-metric-ton barges\r\n\r\nPorts and harbors: Labasa, Lautoka, Levuka, Savusavu, Suva\r\n\r\nMerchant marine:\r\n  total: 5 ships (1,000 GRT or over) totaling 10,721 GRT/13,145 DWT\r\n  ships by type: chemical tanker 2, passenger 1, roll-on/roll-off\r\n  cargo 1, specialized tanker 1 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nAirports: 24 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nAirports--with paved runways:\r\n  total: 3\r\n  over 3,047 m: 1\r\n  1,524 to 2,437 m: 1\r\n  914 to 1,523 m: 1 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nAirports--with unpaved runways:\r\n  total: 21\r\n  914 to 1,523 m: 4\r\n  under 914 m: 17 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMilitary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMilitary branches: Republic of Fiji Military Forces (RFMF;\r\n  includes ground and naval forces)\r\n\r\nMilitary manpower--military age: 18 years of age\r\n\r\nMilitary manpower--availability:\r\n  males age 15-49: 218,853 (1999 est.)\r\n\r\nMilitary manpower--fit for military service:\r\n  males age 15-49: 120,555 (1999 est.)\r\n\r\nMilitary manpower--reaching military age annually:\r\n  males: 9,326 (1999 est.)\r\n\r\nMilitary expenditures--dollar figure: $34 million (1997)\r\n\r\nMilitary expenditures--percent of GDP: 1.6% (1997)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTransnational Issues\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDisputes--international: none\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n======================================================================\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n@Finland\r\n-------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBackground: Long ruled by foreign powers, including Sweden and\r\n  the pre-revolutionary Russian Empire, Finland finally declared\r\n  independence in 1917.

Its key economic sector is\r\n  manufacturing--principally the wood, metals, engineering,\r\n  telecommunications, and electronics industries. Trade is important,\r\n  with the export of goods representing about 30% of GDP. Except for\r\n  timber and several minerals, Finland depends on imports of raw\r\n  materials, energy, and some components for manufactured goods.\r\n  Because of the climate, agricultural development is limited to\r\n  maintaining self-sufficiency in basic products. Forestry, an\r\n  important export earner, provides a secondary occupation for the\r\n  rural population. The economy has come back from the recession of\r\n  1990-92, which had been caused by economic overheating, depressed\r\n  foreign markets, and the dismantling of the barter system between\r\n  Finland and the former Soviet Union. Rapidly increasing integration\r\n  with Western Europe--Finland was one of the 11 countries joining the\r\n  euro monetary system (EMU) on 1 January 1999--will dominate the\r\n  economic picture over the next several years.

France has struggled since\r\n  1958--arguably with success--to construct a presidential democracy\r\n  resistant to the severe instabilities inherent in the parliamentary\r\n  democracy of early 20th century France. In recent years, its\r\n  reconciliation and cooperation with Germany have proved central to\r\n  the economic integration of Europe, including the advent of the euro\r\n  in January 1999.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeography\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: Western Europe, bordering the Bay of Biscay and English\r\n  Channel, between Belgium and Spain southeast of the UK;

The government retains considerable influence over key\r\n  segments of each sector, with majority ownership of railway,\r\n  electricity, aircraft, and telecommunication firms. It has been\r\n  gradually relaxing its control over these sectors since the early\r\n  1990s. The government is slowly selling off its holdings in France\r\n  Telecom, in Air France, and in the insurance, banking, and defense\r\n  industries. Meanwhile, large tracts of fertile land, the application\r\n  of modern technology, and subsidies have combined to make France the\r\n  leading agricultural producer in Western Europe. A major exporter of\r\n  wheat and dairy products, France is practically self-sufficient in\r\n  agriculture. The economy expanded by 3% in 1998, following a 2.3%\r\n  gain in 1997. Persistently high unemployment still poses a major\r\n  problem for the government. France has shied away from cutting\r\n  exceptionally generous social welfare benefits or the enormous state\r\n  bureaucracy, preferring to pare defense spending and raise taxes to\r\n  keep the deficit down.

This has supported a\r\n  sharp decline in extreme poverty; yet because of high income\r\n  inequality a large proportion of the population remains poor. Gabon\r\n  depended on timber and manganese until oil was discovered offshore\r\n  in the early 1970s. The oil sector now accounts for 50% of GDP.\r\n  Gabon continues to face fluctuating prices for its oil, timber,\r\n  manganese, and uranium exports. Despite the abundance of natural\r\n  wealth, the economy is hobbled by poor fiscal management. In 1992,\r\n  the fiscal deficit widened to 2.4% of GDP, and Gabon failed to\r\n  settle arrears on its bilateral debt, leading to a cancellation of\r\n  rescheduling agreements with official and private creditors.\r\n  Devaluation of its Francophone currency by 50% on 12 January 1994\r\n  sparked a one-time inflationary surge, to 35%; the rate dropped to\r\n  6% in 1996. The IMF provided a one-year standby arrangement in\r\n  1994-95 and a three-year Enhanced Financing Facility (EFF) at near\r\n  commercial rates beginning in late 1995. Those agreements mandate\r\n  progress in privatization and fiscal discipline. France provided\r\n  additional financial support in January 1997 after Gabon had met IMF\r\n  targets for mid-1996. In 1997, an IMF mission to Gabon criticized\r\n  the government for overspending on off-budget items, overborrowing\r\n  from the central bank, and slipping on its schedule for\r\n  privatization and administrative reform. Growth in 1999 will depend\r\n  mainly on how world oil prices move.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$7.7 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 1.7% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$6,400 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 8%\r\n  industry: 67%\r\n  services: 25% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 1% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: NA\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture 65%, industry and\r\n  commerce, services\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 21% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $1.5 billion\r\n  expenditures: $1.3 billion, including capital expenditures of $302\r\n  million (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: food and beverage;

Reexport trade normally constitutes a\r\n  major segment of economic activity, but the 50% devaluation of the\r\n  CFA franc in January 1994 made Senegalese goods more competitive and\r\n  hurt the reexport trade. The Gambia has benefited from a rebound in\r\n  tourism after its decline in response to the military's takeover in\r\n  July 1994. Short-run economic progress remains highly dependent on\r\n  sustained bilateral and multilateral aid and on responsible\r\n  government economic management as forwarded by IMF technical help\r\n  and advice.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$1.3 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 3.8% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$1,000 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 23%\r\n  industry: 13%\r\n  services: 64% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 3% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: NA\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture 75%, industry, commerce,\r\n  and services 19%, government 6%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $88.6 million\r\n  expenditures: $98.2 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (FY96/97 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: processing peanuts, fish, and hides; tourism;\r\n  beverages; agricultural machinery assembly, woodworking,\r\n  metalworking; clothing\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 70 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 100%\r\n  hydro: 0%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 70 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: peanuts, millet, sorghum, rice, corn,\r\n  cassava (tapioca), palm kernels; cattle, sheep, goats; forest and\r\n  fishery resources not fully exploited\r\n\r\nExports: $120 million (f.o.b., 1997)\r\n\r\nExports--commodities: peanuts and peanut products, fish, cotton\r\n  lint, palm kernels\r\n\r\nExports--partners: Belgium, Japan, Senegal, Hong Kong, France,\r\n  Switzerland, UK, US, Indonesia (1997)\r\n\r\nImports: $207 million (f.o.b., 1997)\r\n\r\nImports--commodities: foodstuffs, manufactures, raw materials,\r\n  fuel, machinery and transport equipment\r\n\r\nImports--partners: Cote d'Ivoire, Hong Kong, UK, Germany,\r\n  Netherlands, France, Belgium (1997)\r\n\r\nDebt--external: $426 million (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nEconomic aid--recipient: $45.4 million (1995)\r\n\r\nCurrency: 1 dalasi (D) = 100 butut\r\n\r\nExchange rates: dalasi (D) per US$1--10.947 (December 1998),\r\n  10.643 (1998), 10.200 (1997), 9.789 (1996), 9.546 (1995), 9.576\r\n  (1994)\r\n\r\nFiscal year: 1 July--30 June\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunications\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTelephones: 11,000 (1991 est.)\r\n\r\nTelephone system:\r\n  domestic: adequate network of microwave radio relay and open wire\r\n  international: microwave radio relay links to Senegal and\r\n  Guinea-Bissau; satellite earth station--1 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean)\r\n\r\nRadio broadcast stations: AM 2, FM 5, shortwave 0\r\n\r\nRadios: 180,000 (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nTelevision broadcast stations: 1 (government owned) (1997)\r\n\r\nTelevisions: NA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTransportation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRailways: 0 km\r\n\r\nHighways:\r\n  total: 2,700 km\r\n  paved: 956 km\r\n  unpaved: 1,744 km (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nWaterways: 400 km\r\n\r\nPorts and harbors: Banjul\r\n\r\nMerchant marine: none\r\n\r\nAirports: 1 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nAirports--with paved runways:\r\n  total: 1\r\n  over 3,047 m: 1 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMilitary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMilitary branches: Army (includes marine unit), National Police,\r\n  National Guard\r\n\r\nMilitary manpower--availability:\r\n  males age 15-49: 296,976 (1999 est.)\r\n\r\nMilitary manpower--fit for military service:\r\n  males age 15-49: 149,670 (1999 est.)\r\n\r\nMilitary expenditures--dollar figure: $1.2 million (FY96/97)\r\n\r\nMilitary expenditures--percent of GDP: 2% (FY96/97)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTransnational Issues\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDisputes--international: short section of boundary with Senegal is\r\n  indefinite\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n======================================================================\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n@Gaza Strip\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBackground: The Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles on Interim\r\n  Self-Government Arrangements (\"the DOP\"), signed in Washington on 13\r\n  September 1993, provides for a transitional period not exceeding\r\n  five years of Palestinian interim self-government in the Gaza Strip\r\n  and the West Bank. Permanent status negotiations began on 5 May\r\n  1996, but have not resumed since the initial meeting. Under the DOP,\r\n  Israel agreed to transfer certain powers and responsibilities to the\r\n  Palestinian Authority, which includes a Palestinian Legislative\r\n  Council elected in January 1996, as part of interim self-governing\r\n  arrangements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. A transfer of powers\r\n  and responsibilities for the Gaza Strip and Jericho took place\r\n  pursuant to the Israel-PLO 4 May 1994 Cairo Agreement on the Gaza\r\n  Strip and the Jericho Area and in additional areas of the West Bank\r\n  pursuant to the Israel-PLO 28 September 1995 Interim Agreement, the\r\n  Israel-PLO 15 January 1997 Protocol Concerning Redeployment in\r\n  Hebron, and the Israel-PLO 23 October 1998 Wye River Memorandum. The\r\n  DOP provides that Israel will retain responsibility during the\r\n  transitional period for external security and for internal security\r\n  and public order of settlements and Israelis. Permanent status is to\r\n  be determined through direct negotiations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeography\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: Middle East, bordering the Mediterranean Sea, between\r\n  Egypt and Israel\r\n\r\nGeographic coordinates: 31 25 N, 34 20 E\r\n\r\nMap references: Middle East\r\n\r\nArea:\r\n  total: 360 sq km\r\n  land: 360 sq km\r\n  water: 0 sq km\r\n\r\nArea--comparative: slightly more than twice the size of\r\n  Washington, DC\r\n\r\nLand boundaries:\r\n  total: 62 km\r\n  border countries: Egypt 11 km, Israel 51 km\r\n\r\nCoastline: 40 km\r\n\r\nMaritime claims: Israeli-occupied with current status subject to\r\n  the Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement--permanent status to be\r\n  determined through further negotiation\r\n\r\nClimate: temperate, mild winters, dry and warm to hot summers\r\n\r\nTerrain: flat to rolling, sand- and dune-covered coastal plain\r\n\r\nElevation extremes:\r\n  lowest point: Mediterranean Sea 0 m\r\n  highest point: Abu 'Awdah (Joz Abu 'Auda) 105 m\r\n\r\nNatural resources: NEGL\r\n\r\nLand use:\r\n  arable land: 24%\r\n  permanent crops: 39%\r\n  permanent pastures: 0%\r\n  forests and woodland: 11%\r\n  other: 26% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nIrrigated land: 120 sq km (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nNatural hazards: NA\r\n\r\nEnvironment--current issues: desertification; salination of fresh\r\n  water; sewage treatment\r\n\r\nEnvironment--international agreements:\r\n  party to: none of the selected agreements\r\n  signed, but not ratified: none of the selected agreements\r\n\r\nGeography--note: there are 24 Israeli settlements and civilian\r\n  land use sites in the Gaza Strip (August 1998 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPopulation: 1,112,654 (July 1999 est.)\r\n  note: in addition, there are some 6,000 Israeli settlers in the Gaza\r\n  Strip (August 1998 est.)\r\n\r\nAge structure:\r\n  0-14 years: 52% (male 294,196; female 280,017)\r\n  15-64 years: 46% (male 255,209; female 251,317)\r\n  65 years and over: 2% (male 13,475; female 18,440) (1999 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation growth rate: 4.44% (1999 est.)\r\n\r\nBirth rate: 48.24 births/1,000 population (1999 est.)\r\n\r\nDeath rate: 3.8 deaths/1,000 population (1999 est.)\r\n\r\nNet migration rate: 0 migrant(s)/1,000 population (1999 est.)\r\n\r\nSex ratio:\r\n  at birth: 1.05 male(s)/female\r\n  under 15 years: 1.05 male(s)/female\r\n  15-64 years: 1.02 male(s)/female\r\n  65 years and over: 0.73 male(s)/female\r\n  total population: 1.02 male(s)/female (1999 est.)\r\n\r\nInfant mortality rate: 22.92 deaths/1,000 live births (1999 est.)\r\n\r\nLife expectancy at birth:\r\n  total population: 73.44 years\r\n  male: 72.01 years\r\n  female: 74.95 years (1999 est.)\r\n\r\nTotal fertility rate: 7.46 children born/woman (1999 est.)\r\n\r\nNationality:\r\n  noun: NA\r\n  adjective: NA\r\n\r\nEthnic groups: Palestinian Arab and other 99.4%, Jewish 0.6%\r\n\r\nReligions: Muslim (predominantly Sunni) 98.7%, Christian 0.7%,\r\n  Jewish 0.6%\r\n\r\nLanguages: Arabic, Hebrew (spoken by Israeli settlers and many\r\n  Palestinians), English (widely understood)\r\n\r\nLiteracy: NA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCountry name:\r\n  conventional long form: none\r\n  conventional short form: Gaza Strip\r\n  local long form: none\r\n  local short form: Qita Ghazzah\r\n\r\nData code: GZ\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEconomy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEconomy--overview: Economic conditions in the Gaza Strip?under the\r\n  responsibility of the Palestinian Authority since the Cairo\r\n  Agreement of May 1994--have deteriorated since the early 1990s. Real\r\n  per capita GDP for the West Bank and Gaza Strip (WBGS) declined 36%\r\n  between 1992 and 1996 owing to the combined effect of falling\r\n  aggregate incomes and robust population growth. The downturn in\r\n  economic activity was largely the result of Israeli closure\r\n  policies--the imposition of generalized border closures in response\r\n  to security incidents in Israel--which disrupted previously\r\n  established labor and commodity market relationships between Israel\r\n  and the WBGS. The most serious negative social effect of this\r\n  downturn has been the emergence of chronic unemployment; average\r\n  unemployment rates in the WBGS during the 1980s were generally under\r\n  5%, by the mid-1990s this level had risen to over 20%. Since 1997\r\n  Israel's use of comprehensive closures has decreased and, in 1998,\r\n  Israel implemented new policies to reduce the impact of closures and\r\n  other security procedures on the movement of Palestinian goods and\r\n  labor. These positive changes to the conduct of economic activity,\r\n  combined with international donor pledges of over $3 billion made to\r\n  the Palestinian Authority in November, may fuel a moderate economic\r\n  recovery in 1999.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$1.1 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 2.2% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$1,000 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 33%\r\n  industry: 25%\r\n  services: 42% (1995 est., includes West Bank)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 8.8% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: NA\r\n  note: excluding Israeli settlers\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: services 66%, industry 21%,\r\n  agriculture 13% (1996)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 26.8% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $816 million\r\n  expenditures: $866 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1997 est.)\r\n  note: includes West Bank\r\n\r\nIndustries: generally small family businesses that produce\r\n  textiles, soap, olive-wood carvings, and mother-of-pearl souvenirs;\r\n  the Israelis have established some small-scale modern industries in\r\n  an industrial center\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: NA kWh\r\n  note: electricity supplied by Israel\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: NA%\r\n  hydro: NA%\r\n  nuclear: NA%\r\n  other: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: NA kWh\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: NA kWh\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: NA kWh\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: olives, citrus, vegetables; beef, dairy\r\n  products\r\n\r\nExports: $781 million (f.o.b., 1997 est.)

Political settlements for separatist conflicts in South\r\n  Ossetia and Abkhazia remain elusive. The conflict in South Ossetia\r\n  has been dormant since spring 1994, but sporadic violence continues\r\n  between Abkhaz forces and Georgian partisans in western Georgia.\r\n  Russian peacekeepers are deployed in both regions and a UN Observer\r\n  Mission is operating in Abkhazia. As a result of these conflicts,\r\n  Georgia still has about 250,000 internally displaced people. In\r\n  1995, Georgia adopted a new constitution and conducted generally\r\n  free and fair nationwide presidential and parliamentary elections.\r\n  In 1996, the government focused its attention on implementing an\r\n  ambitious economic reform program and professionalizing its\r\n  parliament. Violence and organized crime were sharply curtailed in\r\n  1995 and 1996, but corruption remains rife. Georgia has taken some\r\n  steps to reduce its dependence on Russia, acquiring coastal patrol\r\n  boats in 1997 to replace Russian border units along the Black Sea\r\n  coast. In 1998, Georgia assumed control of its Black Sea coast and\r\n  about half of its land border with Turkey in line with a June 1998\r\n  agreement with Russia. Since 1997, Georgia's parliament has\r\n  sharpened its rhetoric against Russia's continued military presence\r\n  on Georgian territory. In February 1998 an assassination attempt was\r\n  made against President SHEVARDNADZE by supporters of the late former\r\n  president Zviad GAMSAKHURDIA. In October 1998, a disaffected\r\n  military officer led a failed mutiny in western Georgia; the armed\r\n  forces continue to feel the ripple effect of the uprising. Georgia\r\n  faces parliamentary elections this fall, and presidential elections\r\n  next spring. After two years of robust growth, the economy, hurt by\r\n  the financial crisis in Russia, slowed in 1998.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeography\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: Southwestern Asia, bordering the Black Sea, between\r\n  Turkey and Russia\r\n\r\nGeographic coordinates: 42 00 N, 43 30 E\r\n\r\nMap references: Commonwealth of Independent States\r\n\r\nArea:\r\n  total: 69,700 sq km\r\n  land: 69,700 sq km\r\n  water: 0 sq km\r\n\r\nArea--comparative: slightly smaller than South Carolina\r\n\r\nLand boundaries:\r\n  total: 1,461 km\r\n  border countries: Armenia 164 km, Azerbaijan 322 km, Russia 723 km,\r\n  Turkey 252 km\r\n\r\nCoastline: 310 km\r\n\r\nMaritime claims: NA\r\n\r\nClimate: warm and pleasant;

The country imports the bulk of its energy needs,\r\n  including natural gas and oil products. Its only sizable internal\r\n  energy resource is hydropower. Despite the severe damage the economy\r\n  has suffered due to civil strife, Georgia, with the help of the IMF\r\n  and World Bank, made substantial economic gains since 1995,\r\n  increasing GDP growth and slashing inflation. The Georgian economy\r\n  suffered some setbacks in late 1998, including a large budget\r\n  deficit due to a failure to collect tax revenue and to the impact of\r\n  the Russian economic crisis. Georgia also still suffers from energy\r\n  shortages; it privatized the distribution network in 1998, and\r\n  deliveries are steadily improving. Georgia is pinning its hopes for\r\n  long-term recovery on the development of an international\r\n  transportation corridor through the key Black Sea ports of P'ot'i\r\n  and Bat'umi. The construction of a Caspian oil pipeline through\r\n  Georgia--scheduled to open in early 1999--should spur greater Western\r\n  investment in the economy. The global economic slowdown, a growing\r\n  trade deficit, continuing problems with corruption, and political\r\n  uncertainties cloud the short-term economic picture.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$11.2 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 4% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$2,200 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 29%\r\n  industry: 16%\r\n  services: 55% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 10.5% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 3.08 million (1997)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: industry and construction 31%,\r\n  agriculture and forestry 25%, other 44% (1990)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 16% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $364 million\r\n  expenditures: $568 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1998)\r\n\r\nIndustries: steel, aircraft, machine tools, foundry equipment,\r\n  electric locomotives, tower cranes, electric welding equipment,\r\n  machinery for food preparation and meat packing, electric motors,\r\n  process control equipment, trucks, tractors, textiles, shoes,\r\n  chemicals, wood products, wine\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: -0.3% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 6.845 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 29.88%\r\n  hydro: 70.12%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 6.949 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 300 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 404 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: citrus, grapes, tea, vegetables, potatoes;\r\n  livestock\r\n\r\nExports: $230 million (f.o.b., 1997 est.)\r\n\r\nExports--commodities: citrus fruits, tea, wine, other agricultural\r\n  products;

With the\r\n  beginning of the Cold War and increasing tension between the US and\r\n  Soviet Union, two German states were formed in 1949: the western\r\n  Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and the eastern German Democratic\r\n  Republic (GDR). The newly democratic FRG embedded itself in key\r\n  Western economic and security organizations, the EU and NATO, while\r\n  the Communist GDR was on the front line of the Soviet-led Warsaw\r\n  Pact. The decline of the Soviet Union and end of the Cold War\r\n  cleared the path for the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and German\r\n  re-unification in 1990. Germany has expended considerable\r\n  funds--roughly $100 billion a year--in subsequent years working to\r\n  bring eastern productivity and wages up to western standards, with\r\n  mixed results. Unemployment--which in the east is nearly double that\r\n  in the west--has grown over the last several years, primarily as a\r\n  result of structural problems like an inflexible labor market. In\r\n  January 1999, Germany and 10 other members of the EU formed a common\r\n  European currency, the euro, and the German government is now\r\n  looking toward reform of the EU budget and enlargement of the Union\r\n  into Central Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeography\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: Central Europe, bordering the Baltic Sea and the North\r\n  Sea, between the Netherlands and Poland, south of Denmark\r\n\r\nGeographic coordinates: 51 00 N, 9 00 E\r\n\r\nMap references: Europe\r\n\r\nArea:\r\n  total: 356,910 sq km\r\n  land: 349,520 sq km\r\n  water: 7,390 sq km\r\n  note: includes the formerly separate Federal Republic of Germany,\r\n  the German Democratic Republic, and Berlin, following formal\r\n  unification on 3 October 1990\r\n\r\nArea--comparative: slightly smaller than Montana\r\n\r\nLand boundaries:\r\n  total: 3,621 km\r\n  border countries: Austria 784 km, Belgium 167 km, Czech Republic 646\r\n  km, Denmark 68 km, France 451 km, Luxembourg 138 km, Netherlands 577\r\n  km, Poland 456 km, Switzerland 334 km\r\n\r\nCoastline: 2,389 km\r\n\r\nMaritime claims:\r\n  continental shelf: 200-m depth or to the depth of exploitation\r\n  exclusive economic zone: 200 nm\r\n  territorial sea: 12 nm\r\n\r\nClimate: temperate and marine;

On 1 January 1999, Germany and 10 other\r\n  European Union countries launched the European Monetary Union (EMU)\r\n  by permanently fixing their bilateral exchange rates and giving the\r\n  new European Central Bank control over the zone's monetary policy.\r\n  Germans expect to have the new European currency, the euro, in\r\n  pocket by 2002. Domestic demand contributed to a moderate economic\r\n  upswing in early 1998, although unemployment remains high.\r\n  Job-creation measures have helped superficially, but structural\r\n  rigidities--like high wages and costly benefits--make unemployment a\r\n  long-term, not just a cyclical, problem. Although minimally affected\r\n  by the Asian crisis in 1998, Germany revised its 1999 forecast\r\n  downward at the beginning of the year to reflect anticipated effects\r\n  from the global economic slowdown. Over the long term, Germany faces\r\n  budgetary problems--lower tax revenues and higher pension outlays--as\r\n  its population ages. Meanwhile, the German nation continues to\r\n  wrestle with the integration of eastern Germany, whose adjustment\r\n  may take decades to complete despite annual transfers from the west\r\n  of roughly $100 billion a year.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$1.813 trillion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 2.7% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$22,100 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 1.1%\r\n  industry: 33.1%\r\n  services: 65.8% (1998)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 0.9% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 38.2 million (1998)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: industry 33.7%, agriculture 2.7%,\r\n  services 63.6% (1998)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 10.6% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $977 billion\r\n  expenditures: $1.024 trillion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: western: among world's largest and technologically\r\n  advanced producers of iron, steel, coal, cement, chemicals,\r\n  machinery, vehicles, machine tools, electronics, food and beverages;\r\n  eastern: metal fabrication, chemicals, brown coal, shipbuilding,\r\n  machine building, food and beverages, textiles, petroleum refining\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 5% (1998)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 515.058 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 66.23%\r\n  hydro: 3.5%\r\n  nuclear: 29.81%\r\n  other: 0.46% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 509.458 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 42.5 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 36.9 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: western?potatoes, wheat, barley, sugar\r\n  beets, fruit, cabbages;

Gold, timber, and cocoa production are\r\n  major sources of foreign exchange. The domestic economy continues to\r\n  revolve around subsistence agriculture, which accounts for 41% of\r\n  GDP and employs 60% of the work force, mainly small landholders. In\r\n  1995-97, Ghana made mixed progress under a three-year structural\r\n  adjustment program in cooperation with the IMF. On the minus side,\r\n  public sector wage increases and regional peacekeeping commitments\r\n  have led to continued inflationary deficit financing, depreciation\r\n  of the cedi, and rising public discontent with Ghana's austerity\r\n  measures. Power shortages also helped slow growth in 1998.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$33.6 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 3% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$1,800 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 41%\r\n  industry: 14%\r\n  services: 45% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: 31.4% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 3.4%\r\n  highest 10%: 27.3% (1992)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 27.7% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: NA\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture and fishing 61%, industry\r\n  10%, services 29% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 20% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $1.39 billion\r\n  expenditures: $1.47 billion, including capital expenditures of $370\r\n  million (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: mining, lumbering, light manufacturing, aluminum\r\n  smelting, food processing\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 4.2% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 6.1 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 0.66%\r\n  hydro: 99.34%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 5.88 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 225 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 5 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: cocoa, rice, coffee, cassava (tapioca),\r\n  peanuts, corn, shea nuts, bananas;

Greece is a major beneficiary of EU aid,\r\n  equal to about 4% of GDP. The economy has improved steadily over the\r\n  last few years, as the government has tightened policy with the goal\r\n  of qualifying Greece to join the EU's single currency (the euro) in\r\n  2001. In particular, Greece has cut its budget deficit to just over\r\n  2% of GDP and tightened monetary policy, with the result that\r\n  inflation fell below 4% by the end of 1998--the lowest rate in 26\r\n  years. The outlook for 1999 is good with the budget deficit and\r\n  inflation both expected to decline further, while GDP growth stays\r\n  near 3% and the current account deficit remains below 2% of GDP.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$143 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 3% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$13,400 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 8.5%\r\n  industry: 23.5%\r\n  services: 68% (1996)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 3.9% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 4.28 million (1998)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: services 59.2%, agriculture 19.8%,\r\n  industry 21% (1998)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 10% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $45 billion\r\n  expenditures: $47.6 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: tourism;

The\r\n  Greenland Home Rule Government (GHRG) has pursued a light fiscal\r\n  policy since the late 1980s which has helped create surpluses in the\r\n  public budget and low inflation. Since 1990, Greenland has\r\n  registered a foreign trade deficit following the closure of the last\r\n  remaining lead and zinc mine in 1989. Greenland today is critically\r\n  dependent on fishing and fish exports; the shrimp fishery is by far\r\n  the largest income earner. Despite resumption of several interesting\r\n  hydrocarbon and minerals exploration activities, it will take\r\n  several years before production can materialize. Tourism is the only\r\n  sector offering any near-term potential and even this is limited due\r\n  to a short season and high costs. The public sector, including\r\n  publicly owned enterprises and the municipalities, plays the\r\n  dominant role in Greenland's economy. About half the government\r\n  revenues come from grants from the Danish Government, an important\r\n  supplement of GDP.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$945 million (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 0.6% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$16,100 (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NA%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 0.6% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 24,500 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 10.5% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $706 million\r\n  expenditures: $697 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1995)\r\n\r\nIndustries: fish processing (mainly shrimp), handicrafts, furs,\r\n  small shipyards\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 245 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 100%\r\n  hydro: 0%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 245 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: forage crops, garden vegetables;

The traditional sugarcane crop is slowly being replaced by\r\n  other crops, such as bananas (which now supply about 50% of export\r\n  earnings), eggplant, and flowers. Other vegetables and root crops\r\n  are cultivated for local consumption, although Guadeloupe is still\r\n  dependent on imported food, mainly from France. Light industry\r\n  features sugar and rum production. Most manufactured goods and fuel\r\n  are imported.

Over the past 20 years, the tourist\r\n  industry has grown rapidly, creating a construction boom for new\r\n  hotels and the expansion of older ones. More than 1 million tourists\r\n  visit Guam each year. The industry suffered a setback in 1998\r\n  because of the continuing Japanese recession; the Japanese normally\r\n  make up almost 90% of the tourists. Most food and industrial goods\r\n  are imported. Guam faces the problem of building up the civilian\r\n  economic sector to offset the impact of military downsizing.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$3 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$19,000 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NA%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 4% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 65,660 (1995)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: federal and territorial government\r\n  31%, private 69% (trade 21%, services 33%, construction 12%, other\r\n  3%) (1995)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 2% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $524.3 million\r\n  expenditures: $361.4 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1995)\r\n\r\nIndustries: US military, tourism, construction, transshipment\r\n  services, concrete products, printing and publishing, food\r\n  processing, textiles\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 800 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 100%\r\n  hydro: 0%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 800 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: fruits, copra, vegetables;

Coffee, sugar, and bananas are the main products.\r\n  Manufacturing and construction account for one-fifth of GDP. Since\r\n  assuming office in January 1996, President ARZU has worked to\r\n  implement a program of economic liberalization and political\r\n  modernization. The signing of the peace accords in December 1996,\r\n  which ended 36 years of civil war, removed a major obstacle to\r\n  foreign investment. In 1998, Hurricane Mitch caused relatively\r\n  little damage to Guatemala compared to its neighbors. Nevertheless,\r\n  growth will be somewhat smaller due to the storm. Remaining\r\n  challenges include increasing government revenues, and negotiating a\r\n  program with the IMF.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$45.7 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 5% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$3,800 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 24%\r\n  industry: 21%\r\n  services: 55% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 0.6%\r\n  highest 10%: 46.6% (1989)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 6.4% (1998)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 3.32 million (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture 58%, services 14%,\r\n  manufacturing 14%, commerce 7%, construction 4%, transport 2.6%,\r\n  utilities 0.3%, mining 0.1% (1995)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 5.2% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $NA\r\n  expenditures: $NA\r\n\r\nIndustries: sugar, textiles and clothing, furniture, chemicals,\r\n  petroleum, metals, rubber, tourism\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 1.9% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 3.1 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 29.03%\r\n  hydro: 70.97%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 3.1 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: sugarcane, corn, bananas, coffee, beans,\r\n  cardamom;

Cashew crops\r\n  have increased remarkably in recent years, and the country now ranks\r\n  sixth in cashew production. Guinea-Bissau exports fish and seafood\r\n  along with small amounts of peanuts, palm kernels, and timber. Rice\r\n  is the major crop and staple food. However, intermittent fighting\r\n  between Senegalese-backed government troops and a military junta\r\n  destroyed much of the country's infrastructure and caused widespread\r\n  damage to the economy in 1998. Before the war, trade reform and\r\n  price liberalization were the most successful part of the country's\r\n  structural adjustment program under IMF sponsorship. The tightening\r\n  of monetary policy and the development of the private sector had\r\n  also begun to reinvigorate the economy. Inflation dropped sharply in\r\n  the first quarter of 1997. Membership in the WAMU (West African\r\n  Monetary Union), begun in May 1997, was expected to support 5%\r\n  annual growth and contribute to fiscal discipline. Because of high\r\n  costs, the development of petroleum, phosphate, and other mineral\r\n  resources was not a near-term prospect.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$1.2 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 3.5% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$1,000 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 54%\r\n  industry: 11%\r\n  services: 35% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: 48.8% (1991 est.)\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 0.5%\r\n  highest 10%: 42.4% (1991)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 25.6% (1997)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 480,000\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget: $NA\r\n\r\nIndustries: agricultural products processing, beer, soft drinks\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 2.6% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 40 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 100%\r\n  hydro: 0%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 40 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: rice, corn, beans, cassava (tapioca),\r\n  cashew nuts, peanuts, palm kernels, cotton;

Favorable growth factors have\r\n  included expansion in the key agricultural and mining sectors, a\r\n  more favorable atmosphere for business initiative, a more realistic\r\n  exchange rate, a moderate inflation rate, and the continued support\r\n  of international organizations. However, a severe drought and\r\n  political turmoil following the 1997 elections contributed to a\r\n  negative growth rate for 1998. Serious underlying economic problems\r\n  will continue. Electricity has been in short supply and constitutes\r\n  a major barrier to future gains in national output.

Failure to reach agreements with international sponsors\r\n  have denied Haiti badly needed budget and development assistance.\r\n  Meeting aid conditions in 1999 will be especially challenging in the\r\n  face of mounting popular criticism of reforms.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$8.9 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 3% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$1,300 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 42%\r\n  industry: 14%\r\n  services: 44% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: 75% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 8% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 3.6 million (1995)\r\n  note: shortage of skilled labor, unskilled labor abundant (1998)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture 66%, services 25%,\r\n  industry 9%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 60% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $323 million\r\n  expenditures: $363 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (FY97/98 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: sugar refining, flour milling, textiles, cement,\r\n  tourism, light assembly industries based on imported parts\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 0.6% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 415 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 60.24%\r\n  hydro: 39.76%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 415 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: coffee, mangoes, sugarcane, rice, corn,\r\n  sorghum;

A\r\n  dispute between a series of popes and Italy was settled in 1929 by\r\n  treaties that recognized the Vatican City as an independent\r\n  sovereignty and gave Roman Catholicism special status in Italy. The\r\n  US established formal diplomatic relationships with the Vatican in\r\n  1984. Present issues in the Vatican concern the ill health of Pope\r\n  John Paul II, who turns 79 on 20 May 1999, inter-religious dialogue\r\n  and reconciliation, and the adjustment of church doctrine in an era\r\n  of rapid change. About 1 billion people worldwide profess the Roman\r\n  Catholic faith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeography\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: Southern Europe, an enclave of Rome (Italy)\r\n\r\nGeographic coordinates: 41 54 N, 12 27 E\r\n\r\nMap references: Europe\r\n\r\nArea:\r\n  total: 0.44 sq km\r\n  land: 0.44 sq km\r\n  water: 0 sq km\r\n\r\nArea--comparative: about 0.7 times the size of The Mall in\r\n  Washington, DC\r\n\r\nLand boundaries:\r\n  total: 3.2 km\r\n  border countries: Italy 3.2 km\r\n\r\nCoastline: 0 km (landlocked)\r\n\r\nMaritime claims: none (landlocked)\r\n\r\nClimate: temperate; mild, rainy winters (September to mid-May)\r\n  with hot, dry summers (May to September)\r\n\r\nTerrain: low hill\r\n\r\nElevation extremes:\r\n  lowest point: unnamed location 19 m\r\n  highest point: unnamed location 75 m\r\n\r\nNatural resources: none\r\n\r\nLand use:\r\n  arable land: 0%\r\n  permanent crops: 0%\r\n  permanent pastures: 0%\r\n  forests and woodland: 0%\r\n  other: 100% (urban area)\r\n\r\nIrrigated land: 0 sq km (1993)\r\n\r\nNatural hazards: NA\r\n\r\nEnvironment--current issues: NA\r\n\r\nEnvironment--international agreements:\r\n  party to: none of the selected agreements\r\n  signed, but not ratified: Air Pollution, Environmental Modification\r\n\r\nGeography--note: urban; landlocked; enclave of Rome, Italy;\r\n  world's smallest state; outside the Vatican City, 13 buildings in\r\n  Rome and Castel Gandolfo (the pope's summer residence) enjoy\r\n  extraterritorial rights\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPopulation: 870 (July 1999 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation growth rate: 1.15% (1999 est.)\r\n\r\nNationality:\r\n  noun: none\r\n  adjective: none\r\n\r\nEthnic groups: Italians, Swiss, other\r\n\r\nReligions: Roman Catholic\r\n\r\nLanguages: Italian, Latin, various other languages\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCountry name:\r\n  conventional long form: The Holy See (State of the Vatican City)\r\n  conventional short form: Holy See (Vatican City)\r\n  local long form: Santa Sede (Stato della Citta del Vaticano)\r\n  local short form: Santa Sede (Citta del Vaticano)\r\n\r\nData code: VT\r\n\r\nGovernment type: monarchical-sacerdotal state\r\n\r\nCapital: Vatican City\r\n\r\nIndependence: 11 February 1929 (from Italy)\r\n\r\nNational holiday: Installation Day of the Pope (John Paul II), 22\r\n  October (1978)\r\n\r\nConstitution: Apostolic Constitution of 1967 (effective 1 March\r\n  1968)\r\n\r\nLegal system: NA\r\n\r\nSuffrage: limited to cardinals less than 80 years old\r\n\r\nExecutive branch:\r\n  chief of state: Pope JOHN PAUL II (since 16 October 1978)\r\n  head of government: Secretary of State Archbishop Angelo Cardinal\r\n  SODANO (since 2 December 1990)\r\n  cabinet: Pontifical Commission appointed by the pope\r\n  elections: pope elected for life by the College of Cardinals;\r\n  election last held 16 October 1978 (next to be held after the death\r\n  of the current pope); secretary of state appointed by the pope\r\n  election results: Karol WOJTYLA elected pope\r\n\r\nLegislative branch: unicameral Pontifical Commission\r\n\r\nJudicial branch: none; normally handled by Italy\r\n\r\nPolitical parties and leaders: none\r\n\r\nPolitical pressure groups and leaders: none (exclusive of\r\n  influence exercised by church officers)\r\n\r\nInternational organization participation: IAEA, ICFTU, Intelsat,\r\n  IOM (observer), ITU, OAS (observer), OPCW, OSCE, UN (observer),\r\n  UNCTAD, UNHCR, UPU, WIPO, WToO (observer)\r\n\r\nDiplomatic representation in the US:\r\n  chief of mission: Apostolic Nuncio Archbishop Gabriel MONTALVO\r\n  chancery: 3339 Massachusetts Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20008\r\n\r\nDiplomatic representation from the US:\r\n  chief of mission: Ambassador Corrine C.

The storm has dramatically\r\n  changed economic forecasts for Honduras, one of the poorest\r\n  countries in Central America and the hardest hit by Mitch. Honduras\r\n  sustained approximately $3 billion in damages and will probably see\r\n  GDP shrink by 2% in 1999 and unemployment rise. Hardest hit was the\r\n  all-important agricultural sector, which is responsible for the\r\n  majority of exports. As a result, the trade deficit is likely to\r\n  balloon in 1999 to $445 million. However, significant aid has helped\r\n  to stabilize the country. In addition, the Paris Club and bilateral\r\n  creditors have offered substantial debt relief, and Tegucigalpa is\r\n  currently under consideration for inclusion in the IMF-World Bank\r\n  Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC). Additional\r\n  financing will be needed to restore the economy to its pre-Mitch\r\n  level.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$14.4 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 3% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$2,400 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 20%\r\n  industry: 19%\r\n  services: 61% (1997)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: 50% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 1.2%\r\n  highest 10%: 42.1% (1996)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 14.5% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 1.3 million (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture 37%, services 39%,\r\n  industry 24% (1996)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 6.3% (1997);

Increased nationalist\r\n  opposition, which culminated in the government's announcement of\r\n  withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact in 1956, led to massive military\r\n  intervention by Moscow and the swift crushing of the revolt. In the\r\n  more open GORBACHEV years, Hungary led the movement to dissolve the\r\n  Warsaw Pact and steadily moved toward multiparty democracy and a\r\n  market-oriented economy. Following the collapse of the USSR in 1991,\r\n  Hungary has developed close political and economic relations with\r\n  western Europe and is now being considered a possible future member\r\n  of the European Union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeography\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: Central Europe, northwest of Romania\r\n\r\nGeographic coordinates: 47 00 N, 20 00 E\r\n\r\nMap references: Europe\r\n\r\nArea:\r\n  total: 93,030 sq km\r\n  land: 92,340 sq km\r\n  water: 690 sq km\r\n\r\nArea--comparative: slightly smaller than Indiana\r\n\r\nLand boundaries:\r\n  total: 2,009 km\r\n  border countries: Austria 366 km, Croatia 329 km, Romania 443 km,\r\n  Serbia and Montenegro 151 km (all with Serbia), Slovakia 515 km,\r\n  Slovenia 102 km, Ukraine 103 km\r\n\r\nCoastline: 0 km (landlocked)\r\n\r\nMaritime claims: none (landlocked)\r\n\r\nClimate: temperate;

The country appears to have entered a\r\n  period of sustainable growth, gradually falling inflation, and\r\n  stable external balances. The government's main economic priorities\r\n  are to complete structural reforms, particularly the implementation\r\n  of the 1997 pension reform act (the first in the region), taxation\r\n  reform, and planning for comprehensive health care, local government\r\n  finance reform, and the reform of education at all levels. Foreign\r\n  investment has totaled more than $17 billion through 1998. In\r\n  recognition of Hungary's improved macroeconomic situation, all major\r\n  credit-rating agencies listed the country's foreign currency debt\r\n  issuances as investment grade in 1996. The current IMF stand-by\r\n  arrangement expired in February 1998, and Budapest and the IMF agree\r\n  that there is no need to renew it. The OECD welcomed Hungary as a\r\n  member in May 1996, and in December 1997 the EU invited Hungary to\r\n  begin the accession process.

Subsequently this Nordic\r\n  island, whose small population has largely depended on fishing and\r\n  sheep-herding for a living, came under the rule of Norway and then\r\n  Denmark. It gained home rule in 1874 and full independence in 1944.\r\n  Literacy, longevity, and social cohesion are topnotch by world\r\n  standards. Tensions continue with Norway, Russia, and other nearby\r\n  countries over fishing rights in the North Atlantic and adjacent\r\n  seas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeography\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: Northern Europe, island between the Greenland Sea and\r\n  the North Atlantic Ocean, northwest of the UK\r\n\r\nGeographic coordinates: 65 00 N, 18 00 W\r\n\r\nMap references: Arctic Region\r\n\r\nArea:\r\n  total: 103,000 sq km\r\n  land: 100,250 sq km\r\n  water: 2,750 sq km\r\n\r\nArea--comparative: slightly smaller than Kentucky\r\n\r\nLand boundaries: 0 km\r\n\r\nCoastline: 4,988 km\r\n\r\nMaritime claims:\r\n  continental shelf: 200 nm or to the edge of the continental margin\r\n  exclusive economic zone: 200 nm\r\n  territorial sea: 12 nm\r\n\r\nClimate: temperate;

The\r\n  economy depends heavily on the fishing industry, which provides 75%\r\n  of export earnings and employs 12% of the work force. In the absence\r\n  of other natural resources--except energy--Iceland's economy is\r\n  vulnerable to changing world fish prices. The economy remains\r\n  sensitive to declining fish stocks as well as to drops in world\r\n  prices for its main exports: fish and fish products, aluminum, and\r\n  ferrosilicon. The center-right government plans to continue its\r\n  policies of reducing the budget and current account deficits,\r\n  limiting foreign borrowing, containing inflation, revising\r\n  agricultural and fishing policies, diversifying the economy, and\r\n  privatizing state-owned industries. The government remains opposed\r\n  to EU membership, primarily because of Icelanders' concern about\r\n  losing control over their fishing resources. Iceland's economy has\r\n  been diversifying into manufacturing and service industries in the\r\n  last decade, and new developments in software production,\r\n  biotechnology, and financial services are taking place. The tourism\r\n  sector is also expanding, with the recent trends in ecotourism and\r\n  whale-watching.

Production, trade, and investment reforms since 1991\r\n  have provided new opportunities for Indian businesspersons and an\r\n  estimated 300 million middle class consumers. New Delhi has avoided\r\n  debt rescheduling, attracted foreign investment, and revived\r\n  confidence in India's economic prospects since 1991. Many of the\r\n  country's fundamentals--including savings rates (26% of GDP) and\r\n  reserves (now about $30 billion)--are healthy. Even so, the Indian\r\n  Government needs to restore the early momentum of reform, especially\r\n  by continuing reductions in the extensive remaining government\r\n  regulations. India's exports, currency, and foreign institutional\r\n  investment were affected by the East Asian crisis in late 1997 and\r\n  1998; but capital account controls, a low ratio of short-term debt\r\n  to reserves, and enhanced supervision of the financial sector helped\r\n  insulate it from near term balance-of-payments problems. Exports\r\n  fell 5% in 1998 mainly because of the fall in Asian currencies\r\n  relative to the rupee. Energy, telecommunications, and\r\n  transportation bottlenecks continue to constrain growth. A series of\r\n  weak coalition governments have lacked the political strength to\r\n  push reforms forward to address these and other problems. Indian\r\n  think tanks project GDP growth of about 4.5% in 1999. Inflation will\r\n  remain a worrisome problem.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$1.689 trillion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 5.4% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$1,720 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 25%\r\n  industry: 30%\r\n  services: 45% (1997)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: 35% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 4.1%\r\n  highest 10%: 25% (1994)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 14% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: NA\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture 67%, services 18%,\r\n  industry 15% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $42.12 billion\r\n  expenditures: $63.79 billion, including capital expenditures of\r\n  $13.8 billion (FY98/99 budget est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: textiles, chemicals, food processing, steel,\r\n  transportation equipment, cement, mining, petroleum, machinery\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 5.5% (1997)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 404.475 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 80.35%\r\n  hydro: 17.8%\r\n  nuclear: 1.83%\r\n  other: 0.02% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 406.02 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 130 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 1.675 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: rice, wheat, oilseed, cotton, jute, tea,\r\n  sugarcane, potatoes;

It carries a particularly heavy traffic of petroleum\r\n  and petroleum products from the oilfields of the Persian Gulf and\r\n  Indonesia. Its fish are of great and growing importance to the\r\n  bordering countries for domestic consumption and export. Fishing\r\n  fleets from Russia, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan also exploit the\r\n  Indian Ocean, mainly for shrimp and tuna. Large reserves of\r\n  hydrocarbons are being tapped in the offshore areas of Saudi Arabia,\r\n  Iran, India, and western Australia. An estimated 40% of the world's\r\n  offshore oil production comes from the Indian Ocean. Beach sands\r\n  rich in heavy minerals and offshore placer deposits are actively\r\n  exploited by bordering countries, particularly India, South Africa,\r\n  Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunications\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTelephone system:\r\n  international: submarine cables from India to UAE and Malaysia and\r\n  from Sri Lanka to Djibouti and Indonesia\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTransportation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPorts and harbors: Calcutta (India), Chennai (Madras; India),\r\n  Colombo (Sri Lanka), Durban (South Africa), Jakarta (Indonesia),\r\n  Melbourne (Australia), Mumbai (Bombay; India), Richards Bay (South\r\n  Africa)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTransnational Issues\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDisputes--international: some maritime disputes (see littoral\r\n  states)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n======================================================================\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n@Indonesia\r\n---------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBackground: Indonesia declared its independence in 1945 from the\r\n  Netherlands, a claim disputed, then recognized by the Dutch in 1949.\r\n  In 1975 Indonesian troops occupied Portuguese East Timor.

The Indonesian Government initially wavered on\r\n  meeting the conditions it agreed to in exchange for a $42 billion\r\n  IMF assistance package, contributing to further loss in investor\r\n  confidence and outflows of capital. Riots that in many cases\r\n  targeted ethnic Chinese business owners also set back chances that\r\n  Indonesia would quickly stabilize its financial crisis and\r\n  contributed to President SOEHARTO's resignation on 21 May 1998. His\r\n  successor, B.J. HABIBIE, improved cooperation with the IMF. The\r\n  money supply--which expanded rapidly early in the year to prop up\r\n  banks hit by deposit runs--was tightened within a few months, and by\r\n  October, inflation--which reached a 77% annual rate--was significantly\r\n  dampened. The government also announced a bank recapitalization\r\n  program in late 1998, but by early 1999 the plan faced growing\r\n  challenges over its reliance on public funds. Doubts about whether\r\n  the program is adequate underlie forecasts of continued--although\r\n  much less severe--GDP contraction for 1999. Signs of spreading unrest\r\n  and sectarian violence and concern that social instability will\r\n  increase as the 7 June 1999 national election approaches also\r\n  contribute to pessimism about the economy, particularly because\r\n  foreign investors remain reluctant to begin to increase capital\r\n  inflows again. The next government will face the challenge of\r\n  establishing a macroeconomic policy framework that addresses\r\n  longstanding grievances and inequities underlying much of the\r\n  current unrest without hampering an economic recovery.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$602 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: -13.7% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$2,830 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 18.8%\r\n  industry: 40.3%\r\n  services: 40.9% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 3.6%\r\n  highest 10%: 28.3% (1995)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 77% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 87 million (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture 41%, trade, restaurant,\r\n  and hotel 19.8%, manufacturing 14%, construction 4.8%, transport and\r\n  communications 4.75%, other 15.65% (1997)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 15%-20% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $35 billion (of which $15 billion is from international\r\n  financial institutions)\r\n  expenditures: $35 billion, including capital expenditures of $12\r\n  billion (FY98/99 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: petroleum and natural gas;

President KHATAMI has continued to follow the market\r\n  reform plans of former President RAFSANJANI and has indicated that\r\n  he will pursue diversification of Iran's oil-reliant economy\r\n  although he has made little progress toward that goal. In the early\r\n  1990s, Iran experienced a financial crisis and was forced to\r\n  reschedule $15 billion in debt. The strong oil market in 1996 helped\r\n  ease financial pressures on Iran and allowed for Tehran's timely\r\n  debt service payments. Iran's financial situation tightened in 1997\r\n  and deteriorated further in 1998 because of lower oil prices. As a\r\n  result Iran has begun to cut imports and fall into arrears on its\r\n  debt payments.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$339.7 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: -2.1% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$5,000 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NA%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: 53% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 24% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 15.4 million\r\n  note: shortage of skilled labor\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture 33%, manufacturing 21%\r\n  (1988 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: more than 30% (January 1998 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $34.6 billion\r\n  expenditures: $34.9 billion, including capital expenditures of $11.8\r\n  billion (FY96/97)\r\n\r\nIndustries: petroleum, petrochemicals, textiles, cement and other\r\n  construction materials, food processing (particularly sugar refining\r\n  and vegetable oil production), metal fabricating, armaments\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 5.7% (FY95/96 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 79.5 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 90.57%\r\n  hydro: 9.43%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 79.5 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: wheat, rice, other grains, sugar beets,\r\n  fruits, nuts, cotton;

Its subsequent turbulent history has witnessed the\r\n  dictatorship of SADDAM Husayn, civil war with the Kurds, a bloody\r\n  conflict with neighboring Iran, and, in 1990, an invasion of Kuwait,\r\n  swiftly turned back by a Western coalition led by the US.\r\n  Noncooperation with UN Security Council resolution obligations and\r\n  the UN's inspection of Iraq's nuclear, chemical, biological, and\r\n  long-range missile weapons programs remain major problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeography\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: Middle East, bordering the Persian Gulf, between Iran\r\n  and Kuwait\r\n\r\nGeographic coordinates: 33 00 N, 44 00 E\r\n\r\nMap references: Middle East\r\n\r\nArea:\r\n  total: 437,072 sq km\r\n  land: 432,162 sq km\r\n  water: 4,910 sq km\r\n\r\nArea--comparative: slightly more than twice the size of Idaho\r\n\r\nLand boundaries:\r\n  total: 3,631 km\r\n  border countries: Iran 1,458 km, Jordan 181 km, Kuwait 242 km, Saudi\r\n  Arabia 814 km, Syria 605 km, Turkey 331 km\r\n\r\nCoastline: 58 km\r\n\r\nMaritime claims:\r\n  continental shelf: not specified\r\n  territorial sea: 12 nm\r\n\r\nClimate: mostly desert;

In the 1980s, financial problems caused by\r\n  massive expenditures in the eight-year war with Iran and damage to\r\n  oil export facilities by Iran led the government to implement\r\n  austerity measures, borrow heavily, and later reschedule foreign\r\n  debt payments; Iraq suffered economic losses of at least $100\r\n  billion from the war. After the end of hostilities in 1988, oil\r\n  exports gradually increased with the construction of new pipelines\r\n  and restoration of damaged facilities. Iraq's seizure of Kuwait in\r\n  August 1990, subsequent international economic embargoes, and\r\n  military action by an international coalition beginning in January\r\n  1991 drastically reduced economic activity and increased prices. The\r\n  Iraqi Government has been unwilling to abide by UN resolutions so\r\n  that the economic embargo could be removed. The government's\r\n  policies of supporting large military and internal security forces\r\n  and of allocating resources to key supporters of the regime have\r\n  exacerbated shortages. The implementation of the UN's oil-for-food\r\n  program in December 1996 has helped improve economic conditions. For\r\n  the first three six-month phases of the program, Iraq was allowed to\r\n  export $2 billion worth of oil in exchange for food, medicine, and\r\n  other humanitarian goods. The UN allowed Iraq to export $5.2 billion\r\n  of oil beginning with the fourth phase of the program in May 1998.\r\n  At an average volume of 1.9 million barrels per day during the last\r\n  half of 1998, oil exports are about three-quarters their prewar\r\n  level. Per capita food imports have increased significantly, while\r\n  medical supplies and health care services are steadily improving.\r\n  Per capita output and living standards are still well below the\r\n  prewar level, but any estimates have a wide range of error.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$52.3 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 10% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$2,400 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NA%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): NA%\r\n\r\nLabor force: 4.4 million (1989)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: services 48%, agriculture 30%,\r\n  industry 22% (1989)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $NA\r\n  expenditures: $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n\r\nIndustries: petroleum, chemicals, textiles, construction\r\n  materials, food processing\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 27.6 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 97.83%\r\n  hydro: 2.17%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 27.6 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: wheat, barley, rice, vegetables, dates,\r\n  cotton;

Agriculture, once the\r\n  most important sector, is now dwarfed by industry, which accounts\r\n  for 39% of GDP, about 80% of exports, and employs 28% of the labor\r\n  force. Although exports remain the primary engine for Ireland's\r\n  robust growth, the economy is also benefiting from a rise in\r\n  consumer spending and recovery in both construction and business\r\n  investment. Over the past decade, the Irish government has\r\n  implemented a series of national economic programs designed to curb\r\n  inflation, reduce government spending, and promote foreign\r\n  investment. Although the unemployment rate has been halved, it\r\n  remains high, and job creation is a primary concern of government\r\n  policy. Recent efforts have concentrated on improving workers\r\n  qualifications and the education system. Ireland joined in launching\r\n  the euro currency system in January 1999 along with 10 other EU\r\n  nations.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$67.1 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 9.5% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$18,600 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 7%\r\n  industry: 39%\r\n  services: 54% (1997)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 2.5%\r\n  highest 10%: 27.4% (1987)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 2.4% (1998)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 1.52 million (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: services 62.1%, manufacturing and\r\n  construction 27%, agriculture, forestry, and fishing 10%, utilities\r\n  0.9% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 7.7% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $23.5 billion\r\n  expenditures: $20.6 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1998)\r\n\r\nIndustries: food products, brewing, textiles, clothing,\r\n  chemicals, pharmaceuticals, machinery, transportation equipment,\r\n  glass and crystal\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 15.8% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 17.843 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 95.83%\r\n  hydro: 3.99%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0.18% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 17.743 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 200 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 100 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: turnips, barley, potatoes, sugar beets,\r\n  wheat;

It depends on\r\n  imports of crude oil, grains, raw materials, and military equipment.\r\n  Despite limited natural resources, Israel has intensively developed\r\n  its agricultural and industrial sectors over the past 20 years.\r\n  Manufacturing and construction employ about 28% of Israeli workers;\r\n  agriculture, forestry, and fishing 2.6%; and services the rest.\r\n  Israel is largely self-sufficient in food production except for\r\n  grains. Diamonds, high-technology equipment, and agricultural\r\n  products (fruits and vegetables) are leading exports. Israel usually\r\n  posts sizable current account deficits, which are covered by large\r\n  transfer payments from abroad and by foreign loans. Roughly half of\r\n  the government's external debt is owed to the US, which is its major\r\n  source of economic and military aid. The influx of Jewish immigrants\r\n  from the former USSR topped 750,000 during the period 1989-98,\r\n  bringing the population of Israel from the former Soviet Union to\r\n  one million, one-sixth of the total population and adding scientific\r\n  and professional expertise of substantial value for the economy's\r\n  future. The influx, coupled with the opening of new markets at the\r\n  end of the Cold War, energized Israel's economy, which grew rapidly\r\n  in the early 1990s. But growth began slowing in 1996 when the\r\n  government imposed tighter fiscal and monetary policies and the\r\n  immigration bonus petered out.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$101.9 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 1.9% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$18,100 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 2%\r\n  industry: 17%\r\n  services: 81% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 2.8%\r\n  highest 10%: 26.9% (1992)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 5.4% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 2.3 million (1997)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: public services 31.2%, manufacturing\r\n  20.2%, finance and business 13.1%, commerce 12.8%, construction\r\n  7.5%, personal and other services 6.4%, transport, storage, and\r\n  communications 6.2%, agriculture, forestry, and fishing 2.6% (1996)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 8.7% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $55 billion\r\n  expenditures: $58 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: food processing, diamond cutting and polishing,\r\n  textiles and apparel, chemicals, metal products, military equipment,\r\n  transport equipment, electrical equipment, potash mining,\r\n  high-technology electronics, tourism\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 5.4% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 28.035 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 99.88%\r\n  hydro: 0.12%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 27.725 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 310 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: citrus, vegetables, cotton;

The fascist dictatorship of MUSSOLINI after\r\n  World War I, led to the disastrous alliance with HITLER's Germany\r\n  and defeat in World War II. Italy was a founding member of the\r\n  European Economic Community (EEC) and joined in the growing\r\n  political and economic unification of Western Europe, including the\r\n  introduction of the euro in January 1999. On-going problems include\r\n  illegal immigration, the ravages of organized crime, high\r\n  unemployment, and the low incomes and technical standards of\r\n  Southern Italy compared with the North.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeography\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: Southern Europe, a peninsula extending into the central\r\n  Mediterranean Sea, northeast of Tunisia\r\n\r\nGeographic coordinates: 42 50 N, 12 50 E\r\n\r\nMap references: Europe\r\n\r\nArea:\r\n  total: 301,230 sq km\r\n  land: 294,020 sq km\r\n  water: 7,210 sq km\r\n  note: includes Sardinia and Sicily\r\n\r\nArea--comparative: slightly larger than Arizona\r\n\r\nLand boundaries:\r\n  total: 1,932.2 km\r\n  border countries: Austria 430 km, France 488 km, Holy See (Vatican\r\n  City) 3.2 km, San Marino 39 km, Slovenia 232 km, Switzerland 740 km\r\n\r\nCoastline: 7,600 km\r\n\r\nMaritime claims:\r\n  continental shelf: 200-m depth or to the depth of exploitation\r\n  territorial sea: 12 nm\r\n\r\nClimate: predominantly Mediterranean;

This basically capitalistic economy is still\r\n  divided into a developed industrial north, dominated by private\r\n  companies, and a less developed agricultural south, with large\r\n  public enterprises and more than 20% unemployment. Most raw\r\n  materials needed by industry and over 75% of energy requirements\r\n  must be imported. In the second half of 1992, Rome became unsettled\r\n  by the prospect of not qualifying to participate in EU plans for\r\n  economic and monetary union later in the decade; thus, it finally\r\n  began to address its huge fiscal imbalances. Subsequently, the\r\n  government has adopted fairly stringent budgets, abandoned its\r\n  inflationary wage indexation system, and started to scale back its\r\n  generous social welfare programs, including pension and health care\r\n  benefits. In December 1998, Italy adopted a budget compliant with\r\n  the requirements of the European Monetary Union (EMU);\r\n  representatives of government, labor, and employers agreed to an\r\n  update of the 1993 \"social pact,\" which has been widely credited\r\n  with having brought Italy's inflation into conformity with EMU\r\n  requirements. In 1999, Italy must adjust to the loss of an\r\n  independent monetary policy, which it has used quite liberally in\r\n  the past to help cope with external shocks. Italy also must work to\r\n  stimulate employment, promote wage flexibility, and tackle the\r\n  informal economy.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$1.181 trillion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 1.5% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$20,800 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 3.3%\r\n  industry: 33%\r\n  services: 63.7% (1994)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 2.9%\r\n  highest 10%: 23.7% (1991)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 1.8% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 23.193 million\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: services 61%, industry 32%,\r\n  agriculture 7% (1996)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 12.5% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $559 billion\r\n  expenditures: $589 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: tourism, machinery, iron and steel, chemicals, food\r\n  processing, textiles, motor vehicles, clothing, footwear, ceramics\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 0.5% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 226.707 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 80.02%\r\n  hydro: 18.25%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 1.73%\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 264.007 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 800 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 38.1 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: fruits, vegetables, grapes, potatoes, sugar\r\n  beets, soybeans, grain, olives;

Since assuming office in 1992, Prime Minister PATTERSON has\r\n  eliminated most price controls, streamlined tax schedules, and\r\n  privatized government enterprises. Continued tight monetary and\r\n  fiscal policies have helped slow inflation--although inflationary\r\n  pressures are mounting--and stabilize the exchange rate, but have\r\n  resulted in the slowdown of economic growth (moving from 1.5% in\r\n  1992 to 0.5% in 1995). In 1996, GDP showed negative growth (-1.4%)\r\n  and remained negative through 1998. Serious problems include: high\r\n  interest rates; increased foreign competition; the weak financial\r\n  condition of business in general resulting in receiverships or\r\n  closures and downsizings of companies; the shift in investment\r\n  portfolios to non-productive, short-term high yield instruments; a\r\n  pressured, sometimes sliding, exchange rate; a widening merchandise\r\n  trade deficit; and a growing internal debt for government bailouts\r\n  to various ailing sectors of the economy, particularly the financial\r\n  sector. Jamaica's medium-term prospects will depend upon encouraging\r\n  investment in the productive sectors, maintaining a competitive\r\n  exchange rate, stabilizing the labor environment, selling off\r\n  reacquired firms, and implementing proper fiscal and monetary\r\n  policies.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$8.8 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: -2% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$3,300 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 7.4%\r\n  industry: 42.1%\r\n  services: 50.5% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: 34.2% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 2.4%\r\n  highest 10%: 31.9% (1991)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 9.9% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 1.14 million (1996)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: services 41%, agriculture 22.5%,\r\n  industry 19% (1989)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 16.5% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $2.27 billion\r\n  expenditures: $3.66 billion, including capital expenditures of\r\n  $1.265 billion (FY98/99 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: tourism, bauxite, textiles, food processing, light\r\n  manufactures\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 6.125 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 97.96%\r\n  hydro: 2.04%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 6.125 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: sugarcane, bananas, coffee, citrus,\r\n  potatoes, vegetables;

A second basic feature has been the guarantee of\r\n  lifetime employment for a substantial portion of the urban labor\r\n  force; this guarantee is eroding. Industry, the most important\r\n  sector of the economy, is heavily dependent on imported raw\r\n  materials and fuels. The much smaller agricultural sector is highly\r\n  subsidized and protected, with crop yields among the highest in the\r\n  world. Usually self-sufficient in rice, Japan must import about 50%\r\n  of its requirements of other grain and fodder crops. Japan maintains\r\n  one of the world's largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly\r\n  15% of the global catch. For three decades overall real economic\r\n  growth had been spectacular: a 10% average in the 1960s, a 5%\r\n  average in the 1970s, and a 4% average in the 1980s. Growth slowed\r\n  markedly in 1992-95 largely because of the aftereffects of\r\n  overinvestment during the late 1980s and contractionary domestic\r\n  policies intended to wring speculative excesses from the stock and\r\n  real estate markets. Growth picked up to 3.9% in 1996, largely a\r\n  reflection of stimulative fiscal and monetary policies as well as\r\n  low rates of inflation. But in 1997-98 Japan experienced a wrenching\r\n  recession, centered about financial difficulties in the banking\r\n  system and real estate markets and exacerbated by rigidities in\r\n  corporate structures and labor markets. In early 1999 output has\r\n  started to stabilize as emergency government spending begins to take\r\n  hold. The crowding of habitable land area and the aging of the\r\n  population are two major long-run problems.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$2.903 trillion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: -2.6% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$23,100 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 2%\r\n  industry: 38%\r\n  services: 60% (1997)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 0.9% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 67.72 million (November 1998)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: trade and services 50%, manufacturing,\r\n  mining, and construction 33%, utilities and communication 7%,\r\n  agriculture, forestry, and fishing 6%, government 3% (1994)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 4.4% (November 1998)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $407 billion\r\n  expenditures: $711 billion, including capital expenditures (public\r\n  works only) of about $86 billion (FY99/00 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: among world's largest and technologically advanced\r\n  producers of steel and nonferrous metallurgy, heavy electrical\r\n  equipment, construction and mining equipment, motor vehicles and\r\n  parts, electronic and telecommunication equipment, machine tools,\r\n  automated production systems, locomotives and railroad rolling\r\n  stock, ships, chemicals;

Potatoes, cauliflower, tomatoes,\r\n  and especially flowers are important export crops, shipped mostly to\r\n  the UK. The Jersey breed of dairy cattle is known worldwide and\r\n  represents an important export earner. Milk products go to the UK\r\n  and other EU countries. In 1996 the finance sector accounted for\r\n  about 60% of the island's output. Tourism, another mainstay of the\r\n  economy, accounts for 24% of GDP. In recent years, the government\r\n  has encouraged light industry to locate in Jersey, with the result\r\n  that an electronics industry has developed alongside the traditional\r\n  manufacturing of knitwear. All raw material and energy requirements\r\n  are imported, as well as a large share of Jersey's food needs. Light\r\n  tax and death duties make the island a popular tax haven.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$NA\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$NA\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 5%\r\n  industry: 2%\r\n  services: 93% (1995)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 3.7% (1996)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 57,050 (1996)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 0.7% (1996)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $666.9 million\r\n  expenditures: $618.5 million, including capital expenditures of\r\n  $128.4 million (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: tourism, banking and finance, dairy\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: NA kWh\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: NA%\r\n  hydro: NA%\r\n  nuclear: NA%\r\n  other: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 467 million kWh (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: NA kWh;

In the remainder of the 1980s, however, reductions in\r\n  both Arab aid and worker remittances slowed real economic growth to\r\n  an average of roughly 2% per year. Imports--mainly oil, capital\r\n  goods, consumer durables, and food--outstripped exports, with the\r\n  difference covered by aid, remittances, and borrowing. In mid-1989,\r\n  the Jordanian Government began debt-rescheduling negotiations and\r\n  agreed to implement an IMF-supported program designed to gradually\r\n  reduce the budget deficit and implement badly needed structural\r\n  reforms. The Persian Gulf crisis that began in August 1990, however,\r\n  aggravated Jordan's already serious economic problems, forcing the\r\n  government to shelve the IMF program, stop most debt payments, and\r\n  suspend rescheduling negotiations. Aid from Gulf Arab states, worker\r\n  remittances, and trade contracted; and refugees flooded the country,\r\n  producing serious balance-of-payments problems, stunting GDP growth,\r\n  and straining government resources. The economy rebounded in 1992,\r\n  largely due to the influx of capital repatriated by workers\r\n  returning from the Gulf, but recovery was uneven. A preliminary\r\n  agreement with the IMF in early 1999 will provide new loans over the\r\n  next three years. Sluggish growth, along with debt, poverty, and\r\n  unemployment are fundamental ongoing economic problems.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$15.5 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 2.2% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$3,500 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 6%\r\n  industry: 30%\r\n  services: 64% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: 30% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 2.4%\r\n  highest 10%: 34.7% (1991)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 4% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 1.15 million\r\n  note: in addition, there are 300,000 foreign workers (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: industry 11.4%, commerce, restaurants,\r\n  and hotels 10.5%, construction 10%, transport and communications\r\n  8.7%, agriculture 7.4%, other services 52% (1992)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 15% official rate;

and how to convert the country's\r\n  abundant energy resources into a better standard of living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeography\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: Central Asia, northwest of China\r\n\r\nGeographic coordinates: 48 00 N, 68 00 E\r\n\r\nMap references: Commonwealth of Independent States\r\n\r\nArea:\r\n  total: 2,717,300 sq km\r\n  land: 2,669,800 sq km\r\n  water: 47,500 sq km\r\n\r\nArea--comparative: slightly less than four times the size of Texas\r\n\r\nLand boundaries:\r\n  total: 12,012 km\r\n  border countries: China 1,533 km, Kyrgyzstan 1,051 km, Russia 6,846\r\n  km, Turkmenistan 379 km, Uzbekistan 2,203 km\r\n\r\nCoastline: 0 km (landlocked)\r\n  note: Kazakhstan borders the Aral Sea, now split into two bodies of\r\n  water (1,070 km), and the Caspian Sea (1,894 km)\r\n\r\nMaritime claims: none (landlocked)\r\n\r\nClimate: continental, cold winters and hot summers, arid and\r\n  semiarid\r\n\r\nTerrain: extends from the Volga to the Altai Mountains and from\r\n  the plains in western Siberia to oases and desert in Central Asia\r\n\r\nElevation extremes:\r\n  lowest point: Vpadina Kaundy -132 m\r\n  highest point: Zhengis Shingy (Pik Khan-Tengri) 6,995 m\r\n\r\nNatural resources: major deposits of petroleum, natural gas,\r\n  coal, iron ore, manganese, chrome ore, nickel, cobalt, copper,\r\n  molybdenum, lead, zinc, bauxite, gold, uranium\r\n\r\nLand use:\r\n  arable land: 12%\r\n  permanent crops: 11%\r\n  permanent pastures: 57%\r\n  forests and woodland: 4%\r\n  other: 16% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nIrrigated land: 22,000 sq km (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nNatural hazards: earthquakes in the south, mudslides around Almaty\r\n\r\nEnvironment--current issues: radioactive or toxic chemical sites\r\n  associated with its former defense industries and test ranges are\r\n  found throughout the country and pose health risks for humans and\r\n  animals;

It also has considerable agricultural potential with its\r\n  vast steppe lands accommodating both livestock and grain production.\r\n  Kazakhstan's industrial sector rests on the extraction and\r\n  processing of these natural resources and also on a relatively large\r\n  machine building sector specializing in construction equipment,\r\n  tractors, agricultural machinery, and some defense items. The\r\n  breakup of the USSR and the collapse of demand for Kazakhstan's\r\n  traditional heavy industry products have resulted in a sharp\r\n  contraction of the economy since 1991, with the steepest annual\r\n  decline occurring in 1994. In 1995-97 the pace of the government\r\n  program of economic reform and privatization quickened, resulting in\r\n  a substantial shifting of assets into the private sector. The\r\n  December 1996 signing of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium agreement\r\n  to build a new pipeline from western Kazakhstan's Tengiz oil field\r\n  to the Black Sea increases prospects for substantially larger oil\r\n  exports in several years. Kazakhstan's economy turned downward in\r\n  1998 with a 2.5% decline in GDP growth due to slumping oil prices\r\n  and the August financial crisis in Russia. 1999 will also be a\r\n  difficult year.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$52.9 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: -2.5% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$3,100 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 11.5%\r\n  industry: 32.6%\r\n  services: 55.9% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 3.1%\r\n  highest 10%: 24.9% (1993)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 10% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 8.8 million (1997)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: industry 27%, agriculture and forestry\r\n  23%, other 50% (1996)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 13.7% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $2.9 billion\r\n  expenditures: $4.2 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: oil, coal, iron ore, manganese, chromite, lead, zinc,\r\n  copper, titanium, bauxite, gold, silver, phosphates, sulfur, iron\r\n  and steel, nonferrous metal, tractors and other agricultural\r\n  machinery, electric motors, construction materials;

Steps\r\n  have included the removal of import licensing and price controls,\r\n  removal of foreign exchange controls, fiscal and monetary restraint,\r\n  and reduction of the public sector through privatizing publicly\r\n  owned companies and downsizing the civil service. With the support\r\n  of the World Bank, IMF, and other donors, these reforms have led to\r\n  a turnaround in economic performance following a period of negative\r\n  growth in the early 1990s. Kenya's real GDP grew at 5% in 1995 and\r\n  4% in 1996, and inflation remained under control. Growth slowed in\r\n  1997-98. Political violence damaged the tourist industry, and the\r\n  IMF allowed Kenya's Enhanced Structural Adjustment Program to lapse\r\n  due to the government's failure to enact reform conditions and to\r\n  adequately address public sector corruption. Moreover, El Nino rains\r\n  destroyed crops and damaged an already crumbling infrastructure in\r\n  1997 and 1998. Long-term barriers to development include electricity\r\n  shortages, the government's continued and inefficient dominance of\r\n  key sectors, endemic corruption, and the country's high population\r\n  growth rate.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$43.9 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 1.6% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$1,550 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 29%\r\n  industry: 17%\r\n  services: 54% (1997)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: 42% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 1.2%\r\n  highest 10%: 47.7% (1992)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 2.5% (1998)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 9.2 million (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture 75%-80%, nonagriculture\r\n  20%-25%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 50% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $2.6 billion\r\n  expenditures: $2.7 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: small-scale consumer goods (plastic, furniture,\r\n  batteries, textiles, soap, cigarettes, flour), agricultural products\r\n  processing;

Commercially viable phosphate\r\n  deposits were exhausted at the time of independence from the UK in\r\n  1979. Copra and fish now represent the bulk of production and\r\n  exports. The economy has fluctuated widely in recent years. Economic\r\n  development is constrained by a shortage of skilled workers, weak\r\n  infrastructure, and remoteness from international markets. The\r\n  financial sector is at an early stage of development as is the\r\n  expansion of private sector initiatives. Foreign financial aid,\r\n  largely from the UK and Japan, is a critical supplement to GDP,\r\n  equal to 25%-50% of GDP in recent years. Remittances from workers\r\n  abroad account for more than $5 million each year.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$62 million (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 1.9% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$800 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 14%\r\n  industry: 7%\r\n  services: 79% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): -0.6% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 7,870 economically active, not including subsistence\r\n  farmers (1985 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 2%; underemployment 70% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $33.3 million\r\n  expenditures: $47.7 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  million (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: fishing, handicrafts\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 0.7% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 7 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 100%\r\n  hydro: 0%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 7 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: copra, taro, breadfruit, sweet potatoes,\r\n  vegetables; fish\r\n\r\nExports: $6.7 million (f.o.b., 1996 est.)\r\n\r\nExports--commodities: copra 62%, seaweed, fish\r\n\r\nExports--partners: US, Australia, NZ (1996)\r\n\r\nImports: $37.4 million (c.i.f., 1996 est.)\r\n\r\nImports--commodities: foodstuffs, machinery and equipment,\r\n  miscellaneous manufactured goods, fuel\r\n\r\nImports--partners: Australia 46%, Fiji, Japan, NZ, US (1996)\r\n\r\nDebt--external: $7.2 million (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nEconomic aid--recipient: $15.5 million (1995)\r\n\r\nCurrency: 1 Australian dollar ($A) = 100 cents\r\n\r\nExchange rates: Australian dollars ($A) per US$1--1.5853 (January\r\n  1999), 1.5888 (1998), 1.3439 (1997), 1.2773 (1996), 1.3486 (1995),\r\n  1.3667 (1994)\r\n\r\nFiscal year: NA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunications\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTelephones: 1,400 (1984 est.)\r\n\r\nTelephone system:\r\n  domestic: NA\r\n  international: satellite earth station--1 Intelsat (Pacific Ocean)\r\n  note: Kiribati is being linked to the Pacific Ocean Cooperative\r\n  Telecommunications Network, which should improve telephone service\r\n\r\nRadio broadcast stations: AM 1, FM 0, shortwave 0\r\n\r\nRadios: 15,000 (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nTelevision broadcast stations: 1 (1997)\r\n\r\nTelevisions: 0 (1988)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTransportation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRailways: 0 km\r\n\r\nHighways:\r\n  total: 670 km (1996 est.)\r\n  paved: NA km\r\n  unpaved: NA km\r\n\r\nWaterways: small network of canals, totaling 5 km, in Line Islands\r\n\r\nPorts and harbors: Banaba, Betio, English Harbor, Kanton\r\n\r\nMerchant marine:\r\n  total: 1 passenger-cargo (1,000 GRT or over) totaling 1,291\r\n  GRT/1,295 DWT (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nAirports: 21 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nAirports--with paved runways:\r\n  total: 4\r\n  1,524 to 2,437 m: 4 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nAirports--with unpaved runways:\r\n  total: 17\r\n  914 to 1,523 m: 12\r\n  under 914 m: 5 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMilitary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMilitary branches: no regular military forces; Police Force\r\n  (carries out law enforcement functions and paramilitary duties;\r\n  small police posts are on all islands)\r\n\r\nMilitary expenditures--dollar figure: $NA\r\n\r\nMilitary expenditures--percent of GDP: NA%\r\n\r\nMilitary--note: Kiribati does not have military forces; defense\r\n  assistance is provided by Australia and NZ\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTransnational Issues\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDisputes--international: none\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n======================================================================\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n@Korea, North\r\n------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBackground: At the end of World War II, the US and the Soviet\r\n  Union agreed that US troops would accept the surrender of Japanese\r\n  forces south of the 38th parallel and the Soviet Union would do so\r\n  in the north. In 1948, the UN proposed nationwide elections; after\r\n  P'yongyang's refusal to allow UN inspectors in the north, elections\r\n  were held in the south and the Republic of Korea was established.\r\n  The Democratic People's Republic of Korea was established the\r\n  following month in the north. Communist North Korean forces invaded\r\n  South Korea in 1950. US and other UN forces intervened to defend the\r\n  South and Chinese forces intervened on behalf of the North. After a\r\n  bitter three-year war, an armistice was signed in 1953, establishing\r\n  a military demarcation line near the 38th parallel. The North's\r\n  heavy investment in military forces has produced an army of 1\r\n  million troops equipped with thousands of tanks and artillery\r\n  pieces. Despite growing economic hardships, North Korea continues to\r\n  devote a significant portion of its scarce resources to the military.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeography\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: Eastern Asia, northern half of the Korean Peninsula\r\n  bordering the Korea Bay and the Sea of Japan, between China and\r\n  South Korea\r\n\r\nGeographic coordinates: 40 00 N, 127 00 E\r\n\r\nMap references: Asia\r\n\r\nArea:\r\n  total: 120,540 sq km\r\n  land: 120,410 sq km\r\n  water: 130 sq km\r\n\r\nArea--comparative: slightly smaller than Mississippi\r\n\r\nLand boundaries:\r\n  total: 1,673 km\r\n  border countries: China 1,416 km, South Korea 238 km, Russia 19 km\r\n\r\nCoastline: 2,495 km\r\n\r\nMaritime claims:\r\n  territorial sea: 12 nm\r\n  exclusive economic zone: 200 nm\r\n  note: military boundary line 50 nm in the Sea of Japan and the\r\n  exclusive economic zone limit in the Yellow Sea where all foreign\r\n  vessels and aircraft without permission are banned\r\n\r\nClimate: temperate with rainfall concentrated in summer\r\n\r\nTerrain: mostly hills and mountains separated by deep, narrow\r\n  valleys;

Agricultural land is collectivized, state-owned\r\n  industry produces nearly all manufactured goods, and heavy and\r\n  military industries have long been developed at the expense of light\r\n  and consumer industries. Open-air markets since 1995 have gained\r\n  increasing importance in the distribution of food and consumer goods\r\n  but private production remains extremely limited. Total economic\r\n  output has fallen steadily since 1991--perhaps by as much as\r\n  one-half--when the country's economic ties to the Soviet Union and\r\n  Eastern Bloc collapsed. The slide has also been fueled by serious\r\n  energy shortages, aging industrial facilities, and a lack of\r\n  maintenance and new investment. The leadership has tried to maintain\r\n  a high level of military spending but the armed forces have\r\n  nonetheless been affected by the general economic decline. Although\r\n  North Korea has long depended on imports to meet food needs, serious\r\n  fertilizer shortages in recent years have combined with structural\r\n  constraints--such as a shortage of arable land and a short growing\r\n  season--to reduce staple grain output to more than 1 million tons\r\n  below what the country needs to meet even minimal demand.

In 1948, the UN proposed nationwide elections; after\r\n  P'yongyang's refusal to allow UN inspectors in the north, elections\r\n  were held in the south and the Republic of Korea was established.\r\n  The Democratic People's Republic of Korea was established the\r\n  following month in the north. Communist North Korean forces invaded\r\n  South Korea in 1950. US and other UN forces intervened to defend the\r\n  South and Chinese forces intervened on behalf of the North. After a\r\n  bitter three-year war, an armistice was signed in 1953, establishing\r\n  a military demarcation line near the 38th parallel. Thereafter,\r\n  South Korea achieved amazing economic growth, with per capita output\r\n  rising to 13 times the level in the North. Since late 1997, however,\r\n  the nation has suffered widespread financial and organizational\r\n  difficulties. Continuing tensions between North and South have\r\n  raised concerns of provocative military actions by the North.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeography\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: Eastern Asia, southern half of the Korean Peninsula\r\n  bordering the Sea of Japan and the Yellow Sea\r\n\r\nGeographic coordinates: 37 00 N, 127 30 E\r\n\r\nMap references: Asia\r\n\r\nArea:\r\n  total: 98,480 sq km\r\n  land: 98,190 sq km\r\n  water: 290 sq km\r\n\r\nArea--comparative: slightly larger than Indiana\r\n\r\nLand boundaries:\r\n  total: 238 km\r\n  border countries: North Korea 238 km\r\n\r\nCoastline: 2,413 km\r\n\r\nMaritime claims:\r\n  contiguous zone: 24 nm\r\n  continental shelf: not specified\r\n  exclusive economic zone: 200 nm\r\n  territorial sea: 12 nm;

Three decades ago\r\n  its GDP per capita was comparable with levels in the poorer\r\n  countries of Africa and Asia. Today its GDP per capita is seven\r\n  times India's, 13 times North Korea's, and already near the lesser\r\n  economies of the European Union. This success through the late 1980s\r\n  was achieved by a system of close government business ties,\r\n  including directed credit, import restrictions, sponsorship of\r\n  specific industries, and a strong labor effort. The government\r\n  promoted the import of raw materials and technology at the expense\r\n  of consumer goods and encouraged savings and investment over\r\n  consumption. The Asian financial crisis of 1997-98 exposed certain\r\n  longstanding weaknesses in South Korea's development model,\r\n  including high debt/equity ratios, massive foreign borrowing, and an\r\n  undisciplined financial sector. By the end of 1998 it had recovered\r\n  financial stability, rebuilding foreign exchange reserves to record\r\n  levels by running a current account surplus of $40 billion. As of\r\n  December 1998, the first tentative signs of a rebound in the economy\r\n  emerged, and most forecasters expect GDP growth to turn positive at\r\n  least in the second half of 1999. Seoul has also made a positive\r\n  start on a program to get the country's largest business groups to\r\n  swap subsidiaries to promote specialization, and the administration\r\n  has directed many of the mid-sized conglomerates into debt-workout\r\n  programs with creditor banks. Challenges for the future include\r\n  cutting redundant staff, which reaches 20%-30% at most firms and\r\n  maintaining the impetus for structural reform.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$584.7 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: -6.8% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$12,600 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 6%\r\n  industry: 43%\r\n  services: 51% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 7.5% (1998)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 20 million\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: services and other 52%, mining and\r\n  manufacturing 27%, agriculture, fishing, forestry 21% (1991)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 7.9% (1998)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $100.4 billion\r\n  expenditures: $100.5 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: electronics, automobile production, chemicals,\r\n  shipbuilding, steel, textiles, clothing, footwear, food processing\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 3.1% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 194.163 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 61.18%\r\n  hydro: 2.65%\r\n  nuclear: 36.17%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 194.163 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: rice, root crops, barley, vegetables,\r\n  fruit;

Petroleum accounts for nearly half of GDP, 90% of\r\n  export revenues, and 75% of government income. Kuwait lacks water\r\n  and has practically no arable land, thus preventing development of\r\n  agriculture. With the exception of fish, it depends almost wholly on\r\n  food imports. About 75% of potable water must be distilled or\r\n  imported. The economy improved moderately in 1994-97, but in 1998\r\n  suffered from the large decline in world oil prices. The Kuwaiti\r\n  cabinet approved a reform package in January 1999, including\r\n  reducing subsidies and increasing taxes on large consumer goods.\r\n  Nevertheless, Kuwait anticipates continuing budget deficits for the\r\n  next few years. Kuwait is attracting foreign oil companies to\r\n  develop fields in the northern part of the country.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$43.7 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: -5% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$22,700 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 0%\r\n  industry: 55%\r\n  services: 45% (1996)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 1% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 1.1 million (1996 est.)\r\n  note: 68% of the population in the 15-64 age group is non-national\r\n  (July 1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: government and social services 50%,\r\n  services 40%, industry and agriculture 10% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 1.8% (official 1996 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $8.1 billion\r\n  expenditures: $14.5 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (FY98/99 budget est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: petroleum, petrochemicals, desalination, food\r\n  processing, construction materials, salt, construction\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 1% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 23 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 100%\r\n  hydro: 0%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 23 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: practically no crops;

Cotton, wool, and\r\n  meat are the main agricultural products and exports. Industrial\r\n  exports include gold, mercury, uranium, and hydropower. Kyrgyzstan\r\n  has been one of the most progressive countries of the former Soviet\r\n  Union in carrying out market reforms. Following a successful\r\n  stabilization program, which lowered inflation from 88% in 1994 to\r\n  15% for 1997, attention is turning toward stimulating growth. Much\r\n  of the government's stock in enterprises has been sold. Drops in\r\n  production have been severe since the breakup of the Soviet Union in\r\n  December 1991, but by mid-1995 production began to recover and\r\n  exports began to increase. Pensioners, unemployed workers, and\r\n  government workers with salary arrears continue to suffer. Foreign\r\n  assistance played a substantial role in the country's economic\r\n  turnaround in 1996-97. The government has adopted a series of\r\n  measures to combat some of the severe economic problems such as\r\n  excessive debt and inadequate revenue collection, encountered in\r\n  1998.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$9.8 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 1.8% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$2,200 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 47%\r\n  industry: 12%\r\n  services: 41% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: 40% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 2.7%\r\n  highest 10%: 26.2% (1993)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 18.4% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 1.7 million\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture and forestry 40%, industry\r\n  and construction 19%, other 41% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 6% 1998 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $225 million\r\n  expenditures: $308 million, including capital expenditures of $11\r\n  million (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: small machinery, textiles, food processing, cement,\r\n  shoes, sawn logs, refrigerators, furniture, electric motors, gold,\r\n  rare earth metals\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 14% (1998 est.)\r\n  note: the gold industry spurted in 1998 giving industry as a whole a\r\n  boost on a small base while the rest of the economy, including\r\n  agriculture, lagged\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 13.49 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 9.56%\r\n  hydro: 90.44%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 10.92 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 6.32 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 3.75 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: tobacco, cotton, potatoes, vegetables,\r\n  grapes, fruits and berries;

The results, starting\r\n  from an extremely low base, have been striking--growth averaged 7% in\r\n  1988-96. Because Laos depends heavily on its trade with Thailand, it\r\n  fell victim to the financial crisis in the region beginning in 1997.\r\n  Laos is a landlocked country with a primitive infrastructure. It has\r\n  no railroads, a rudimentary road system, and limited external and\r\n  internal telecommunications. Electricity is available in only a few\r\n  urban areas. Subsistence agriculture accounts for half of GDP and\r\n  provides 80% of total employment. The predominant crop is glutinous\r\n  rice. In non-drought years, Laos is self-sufficient overall in food,\r\n  but each year flood, pests, and localized drought cause shortages in\r\n  various parts of the country. For the foreseeable future the economy\r\n  will continue to depend on aid from the IMF and other international\r\n  sources; Japan is currently the largest bilateral aid donor; aid\r\n  from the former USSR/Eastern Europe has been cut sharply. As in many\r\n  developing countries, deforestation and soil erosion will hamper\r\n  efforts to regain a high rate of GDP growth.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$6.6 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 4% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$1,260 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 51%\r\n  industry: 21%\r\n  services: 28% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: 46.1% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 4.2%\r\n  highest 10%: 26.4% (1992)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 112% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 1 million-1.5 million\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture 80% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 5.7% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $230.2 million\r\n  expenditures: $365.9 million, including capital expenditures of $317\r\n  million (1996)\r\n\r\nIndustries: tin and gypsum mining, timber, electric power,\r\n  agricultural processing, construction, garments\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 8.9% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 900 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 0.04%\r\n  hydro: 99.96%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1998)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 287 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 640 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 27 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: sweet potatoes, vegetables, corn, coffee,\r\n  sugarcane, tobacco, cotton;

After a brief\r\n  period of independence between the two World Wars, Latvia was\r\n  annexed by the USSR in 1940 under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. The\r\n  USSR recaptured Latvia from its German occupiers in 1944. Latvia\r\n  reestablished its independence in August 1991, a few months prior to\r\n  the collapse of the Soviet Union; the last Russian troops left in\r\n  1994. The status of ethnic Russians, who make up 30% of the\r\n  population, is an issue of concern to Moscow. Unemployment has\r\n  become a growing problem and Latvia hopes to receive an invitation\r\n  to begin EU accession talks by the end of 1999.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeography\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: Eastern Europe, bordering the Baltic Sea, between\r\n  Estonia and Lithuania\r\n\r\nGeographic coordinates: 57 00 N, 25 00 E\r\n\r\nMap references: Europe\r\n\r\nArea:\r\n  total: 64,589 sq km\r\n  land: 64,589 sq km\r\n  water: 0 sq km\r\n\r\nArea--comparative: slightly larger than West Virginia\r\n\r\nLand boundaries:\r\n  total: 1,150 km\r\n  border countries: Belarus 141 km, Estonia 339 km, Lithuania 453 km,\r\n  Russia 217 km\r\n\r\nCoastline: 531 km\r\n\r\nMaritime claims:\r\n  continental shelf: 200-m depth or to the depth of exploitation\r\n  exclusive economic zone: 200 nm\r\n  territorial sea: 12 nm\r\n\r\nClimate: maritime;

The drop in GDP growth is\r\n  largely attributable to the impact of Russia's financial crisis and\r\n  reduced investment in emerging markets following the Asian financial\r\n  troubles. Unofficial sanctions that Russia imposed in the spring\r\n  initially hit Latvia's exporters--Russia is among Latvia's top three\r\n  trade partners--but also prompted them to seek alternative markets.\r\n  Latvia continued its strict fiscal and monetary policy, including\r\n  its second balanced budget and had a 1.8% budget surplus. Its draft\r\n  1999 budget is based on conservative projections of 2% to 4% GDP\r\n  growth and 4.5% inflation. Unemployment climbed to 9.2% in 1998, a\r\n  considerable increase over the 6.7% rate in 1997. Latvia continued\r\n  to have a high current account deficit, estimated at about 9%.\r\n  Privatization of large state utilities--especially the energy\r\n  sector--was postponed and is unlikely to resume before late 1999. EU\r\n  accession remains Latvia's top priority, and Latvia expects to be\r\n  invited to start EU accession talks by the end of 1999. Continued\r\n  troubles in the Russian and East Asian economies probably will hold\r\n  growth to around 2.5% in 1999.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$9.7 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 3.6% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$4,100 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 7%\r\n  industry: 28%\r\n  services: 65% (1997)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 4.3%\r\n  highest 10%: 22.1% (1993)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 4.7% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 1.4 million (1997)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: industry 41%, agriculture and forestry\r\n  16%, services 43% (1990)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 9.2% (1998)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $1.33 billion\r\n  expenditures: $1.27 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: buses, vans, street and railroad cars, synthetic\r\n  fibers, agricultural machinery, fertilizers, washing machines,\r\n  radios, electronics, pharmaceuticals, processed foods, textiles;\r\n  dependent on imports for energy, raw materials, and intermediate\r\n  products\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 3% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 3.2 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 28.12%\r\n  hydro: 71.88%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 6.18 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 300 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 3.28 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: grain, sugar beets, potatoes, vegetables;\r\n  beef, milk, eggs;

Since the end of the civil war, the Lebanese have formed\r\n  six cabinets, conducted two legislative elections, and held their\r\n  first municipal elections in 35 years. Most of the militias have\r\n  been weakened or disbanded. The Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) has\r\n  seized vast quantities of weapons used by the militias during the\r\n  war and extended central government authority over about one-half of\r\n  the country. Hizballah, the radical Shi'a party, retains its\r\n  weapons. Foreign forces still occupy areas of Lebanon. Israel\r\n  maintains troops in southern Lebanon and continues to support a\r\n  proxy militia, the Army of South Lebanon (ASL), along a narrow\r\n  stretch of territory contiguous to its border. The ASL's enclave\r\n  encompasses this self-declared security zone and about 20 kilometers\r\n  north to the strategic town of Jazzin. Syria maintains about 25,000\r\n  troops in Lebanon based mainly in Beirut, North Lebanon, and the\r\n  Bekaa Valley. Syria's deployment was legitimized by the Arab League\r\n  during Lebanon's civil war and in the Ta'if Accord. Citing the\r\n  continued weakness of the LAF, Beirut's requests, and failure of the\r\n  Lebanese Government to implement all of the constitutional reforms\r\n  in the Ta'if Accord, Damascus has so far refused to withdraw its\r\n  troops from Lebanon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeography\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: Middle East, bordering the Mediterranean Sea, between\r\n  Israel and Syria\r\n\r\nGeographic coordinates: 33 50 N, 35 50 E\r\n\r\nMap references: Middle East\r\n\r\nArea:\r\n  total: 10,400 sq km\r\n  land: 10,230 sq km\r\n  water: 170 sq km\r\n\r\nArea--comparative: about 0.7 times the size of Connecticut\r\n\r\nLand boundaries:\r\n  total: 454 km\r\n  border countries: Israel 79 km, Syria 375 km\r\n\r\nCoastline: 225 km\r\n\r\nMaritime claims:\r\n  territorial sea: 12 nm\r\n\r\nClimate: Mediterranean;

Peace has enabled the central government to restore\r\n  control in Beirut, begin collecting taxes, and regain access to key\r\n  port and government facilities. Economic recovery has been helped by\r\n  a financially sound banking system and resilient small- and\r\n  medium-scale manufacturers, with family remittances, banking\r\n  services, manufactured and farm exports, and international aid as\r\n  the main sources of foreign exchange. Lebanon's economy has made\r\n  impressive gains since the launch of \"Horizon 2000,\" the\r\n  government's $20 billion reconstruction program in 1993. Real GDP\r\n  grew 8% in 1994 and 7% in 1995 before Israel's Operation Grapes of\r\n  Wrath in April 1996 stunted economic activity. During 1992-98,\r\n  annual inflation fell from more than 100% to 5%, and foreign\r\n  exchange reserves jumped to more than $6 billion from $1.4 billion.\r\n  Burgeoning capital inflows have generated foreign payments\r\n  surpluses, and the Lebanese pound has remained relatively stable.\r\n  Progress also has been made in rebuilding Lebanon's war-torn\r\n  physical and financial infrastructure. Solidere, a $2-billion firm,\r\n  is managing the reconstruction of Beirut's central business\r\n  district; the stock market reopened in January 1996; and\r\n  international banks and insurance companies are returning. The\r\n  government nonetheless faces serious challenges in the economic\r\n  arena. It has had to fund reconstruction by tapping foreign exchange\r\n  reserves and boosting borrowing. Reducing the government budget\r\n  deficit is a major goal of the LAHUD government. The stalled peace\r\n  process and ongoing violence in southern Lebanon could lead to wider\r\n  hostilities that would disrupt vital capital inflows. Furthermore,\r\n  the gap between rich and poor has widened in the 1990's, resulting\r\n  in grassroots dissatisfaction over the skewed distribution of the\r\n  reconstruction's benefits and leading the government to shift its\r\n  focus from rebuilding infrastructure to improving living conditions.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$15.8 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 3% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$4,500 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 4%\r\n  industry: 23%\r\n  services: 73% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 5% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 1 million\r\n  note: in addition, there are as many as 1 million foreign workers\r\n  (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: services 62%, industry 31%,\r\n  agriculture 7% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 18% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $4.9 billion\r\n  expenditures: $7.9 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: banking;

Its economy is based on\r\n  subsistence agriculture, livestock, and remittances from miners\r\n  employed in South Africa. The number of such mine workers has\r\n  declined steadily over the past several years. In 1996 their\r\n  remittances added about 33% to GDP compared with the addition of\r\n  roughly 67% in 1990. A small manufacturing base depends largely on\r\n  farm products which support the milling, canning, leather, and jute\r\n  industries. Agricultural products are exported primarily to South\r\n  Africa. Proceeds from membership in a common customs union with\r\n  South Africa form the majority of government revenue. Although\r\n  drought has decreased agricultural activity over the past few years,\r\n  completion of a major hydropower facility in January 1998 now\r\n  permits the sale of water to South Africa, generating royalties that\r\n  will be an important source of income for Lesotho. The pace of\r\n  parastatal privatization has increased in recent years. Civil\r\n  disorder in September 1998 destroyed 80% of the commercial\r\n  infrastructure in Maseru and two other major towns. Most firms were\r\n  not covered by insurance, and the rebuilding of small and medium\r\n  business will be a significant challenge in terms of both economic\r\n  growth and employment levels.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$5.1 billion (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 10% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$2,400 (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 14%\r\n  industry: 42%\r\n  services: 44% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: 49.2% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 0.9%\r\n  highest 10%: 43.4% (1986-87)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 8% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 689,000 economically active\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: 86% of resident population engaged in\r\n  subsistence agriculture; roughly 35% of the active male wage earners\r\n  work in South Africa\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: substantial unemployment and underemployment\r\n  effecting more than half of the labor force (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $507 million\r\n  expenditures: $487 million, including capital expenditures of $170\r\n  million (FY96/97 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: food, beverages, textiles, handicrafts; construction;\r\n  tourism\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 19.7% (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 0 kWh (1995)\r\n  note: electricity supplied by South Africa\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: NA%\r\n  hydro: NA%\r\n  nuclear: NA%\r\n  other: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 335 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 335 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: corn, wheat, pulses, sorghum, barley;\r\n  livestock\r\n\r\nExports: $200 million (f.o.b., 1997 est.)\r\n\r\nExports--commodities: manufactures 65% (clothing, footwear, road\r\n  vehicles), wool and mohair 7%, food and live animals 7% (1996)\r\n\r\nExports--partners: South African Customs Union 66%, North America\r\n  26%, EU 4% (1996)\r\n\r\nImports: $880 million (f.o.b., 1997 est.)\r\n\r\nImports--commodities: food; building materials, vehicles,\r\n  machinery, medicines, petroleum products (1995)\r\n\r\nImports--partners: South African Customs Union 90%, Asia 6%, EU 2%\r\n  (1995)\r\n\r\nDebt--external: $660 million (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nEconomic aid--recipient: $123.7 million (1995)\r\n\r\nCurrency: 1 loti (L) = 100 lisente\r\n  note: maloti (M) is the plural form of loti\r\n\r\nExchange rates: maloti (M) per US$1--5.98380 (January 1999),\r\n  5.52828 (1998), 4.60796 (1997), 4.29935 (1996), 3.62709 (1995),\r\n  3.55080 (1994); note--the Basotho loti is at par with the South\r\n  African rand\r\n\r\nFiscal year: 1 April--31 March\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunications\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTelephones: 12,000 (1991 est.)\r\n\r\nTelephone system: rudimentary system\r\n  domestic: consists of a few landlines, a small microwave radio relay\r\n  system, and a minor radiotelephone communication system\r\n  international: satellite earth station--1 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean)\r\n\r\nRadio broadcast stations: AM 3, FM 4, shortwave 0\r\n\r\nRadios: 66,000\r\n\r\nTelevision broadcast stations: NA\r\n\r\nTelevisions: 11,000 (1992 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTransportation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRailways:\r\n  total: 2.6 km; note--owned by, operated by, and included in the\r\n  statistics of South Africa\r\n  narrow gauge: 2.6 km 1.067-m gauge (1995)\r\n\r\nHighways:\r\n  total: 4,955 km\r\n  paved: 887 km\r\n  unpaved: 4,068 km (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nPorts and harbors: none\r\n\r\nAirports: 29 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nAirports--with paved runways:\r\n  total: 4\r\n  over 3,047 m: 1\r\n  914 to 1,523 m: 1\r\n  under 914 m: 2 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nAirports--with unpaved runways:\r\n  total: 25\r\n  914 to 1,523 m: 4\r\n  under 914 m: 21 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMilitary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMilitary branches: Lesotho Defense Force (LDF; includes Army and\r\n  Air Wing), Royal Lesotho Mounted Police (RLMP)\r\n\r\nMilitary manpower--availability:\r\n  males age 15-49: 504,442 (1999 est.)\r\n\r\nMilitary manpower--fit for military service:\r\n  males age 15-49: 271,925 (1999 est.)\r\n\r\nMilitary expenditures--dollar figure: $NA\r\n\r\nMilitary expenditures--percent of GDP: NA%\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTransnational Issues\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDisputes--international: none\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n======================================================================\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n@Liberia\r\n-------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBackground: The 1995 Abuja Peace Accords ended seven years of\r\n  civil warfare in Liberia. More than 20,000 of the estimated 33,000\r\n  factional fighters gave up their arms to the Cease-Fire Monitoring\r\n  Group of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOMOG).\r\n  Free and open presidential and legislative elections were held 19\r\n  July 1997; former faction leader, Charles TAYLOR, and his National\r\n  Patriotic Party won overwhelming victories. The years of civil\r\n  strife coupled with the flight of most business people disrupted\r\n  formal economic activity. A short-lived armed clash in September\r\n  1998 between government forces and supporters of factional leader\r\n  Roosevelt JOHNSON and continuing uncertainty about the security\r\n  situation have slowed the process of rebuilding the social and\r\n  economic structure of the war-torn country. For two centuries the US\r\n  has had uniquely close ties to Liberia and today is a major aid\r\n  donor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeography\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: Western Africa, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean,\r\n  between Cote d'Ivoire and Sierra Leone\r\n\r\nGeographic coordinates: 6 30 N, 9 30 W\r\n\r\nMap references: Africa\r\n\r\nArea:\r\n  total: 111,370 sq km\r\n  land: 96,320 sq km\r\n  water: 15,050 sq km\r\n\r\nArea--comparative: slightly larger than Tennessee\r\n\r\nLand boundaries:\r\n  total: 1,585 km\r\n  border countries: Guinea 563 km, Cote d'Ivoire 716 km, Sierra Leone\r\n  306 km\r\n\r\nCoastline: 579 km\r\n\r\nMaritime claims:\r\n  territorial sea: 200 nm\r\n\r\nClimate: tropical;

Richly endowed with water, mineral resources, forests, and a\r\n  climate favorable to agriculture, Liberia had been a producer and\r\n  exporter of basic products, while local manufacturing, mainly\r\n  foreign owned, had been small in scope. The democratically elected\r\n  government, installed in August 1997, inherited massive\r\n  international debts and currently relies on revenues from its\r\n  maritime registry to provide the bulk of its foreign exchange\r\n  earnings. The restoration of the infrastructure and the raising of\r\n  incomes in this ravaged economy depends on the implementation of\r\n  sound macro- and micro-economic policies of the new government,\r\n  including the encouragement of foreign investment.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$2.8 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$1,000 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 30%\r\n  industry: 36%\r\n  services: 34%\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: 80%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): NA%\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture 70%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 70%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $NA\r\n  expenditures: $NA\r\n\r\nIndustries: rubber processing, palm oil processing, diamonds\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 0%\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 480 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 100%\r\n  hydro: 0%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 480 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: rubber, coffee, cocoa, rice, cassava\r\n  (tapioca), palm oil, sugarcane, bananas;

These\r\n  oil revenues and a small population give Libya one of the highest\r\n  per capita GDPs in Africa, but little of this income flows down to\r\n  the lower orders of society. Low oil prices in 1998 cut back revenue\r\n  sharply, and GDP growth fell by 1%. In this statist society, import\r\n  restrictions and inefficient resource allocations have led to\r\n  periodic shortages of basic goods and foodstuffs. The nonoil\r\n  manufacturing and construction sectors, which account for about 20%\r\n  of GDP, have expanded from processing mostly agricultural products\r\n  to include the production of petrochemicals, iron, steel, and\r\n  aluminum. Agriculture accounts for only 5% of GDP; it employs 18% of\r\n  the labor force. Climatic conditions and poor soils severely limit\r\n  farm output, and Libya imports about 75% of its food requirements.\r\n  The UN sanctions imposed in April 1992 do not have a major impact on\r\n  the economy although they have increased transaction and\r\n  transportation costs.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$38 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: -1% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$6,700 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 5%\r\n  industry: 55%\r\n  services: 40% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 24.2% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 1 million\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: industry 31%, services 27%, government\r\n  24%, agriculture 18%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 30% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $3.6 billion\r\n  expenditures: $5.1 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: petroleum, food processing, textiles, handicrafts,\r\n  cement\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 17 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 100%\r\n  hydro: 0%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 17 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: wheat, barley, olives, dates, citrus,\r\n  vegetables, peanuts;

Foreign\r\n  direct investment and the privatization program maintained their\r\n  momentum in 1998. However, the current account deficit has hovered\r\n  around 8% to 10% of GDP annually since 1995--the result of greater\r\n  demand for consumer goods and falling growth in exports.

Services,\r\n  especially banking, account for a growing proportion of the economy.\r\n  Agriculture is based on small family-owned farms. Luxembourg has\r\n  especially close trade and financial ties to Belgium and the\r\n  Netherlands, and as a member of the EU, enjoys the advantages of the\r\n  open European market.

Agriculture, including fishing and forestry, is the\r\n  mainstay of the economy, accounting for 32% of GDP and contributing\r\n  more than 70% to export earnings. Industry features textile\r\n  manufacturing and the processing of agricultural products. Growth in\r\n  output in 1992-97 averaged less than the growth rate of the\r\n  population. Growth has been held back by antigovernment strikes and\r\n  demonstrations, a decline in world coffee demand, and the erratic\r\n  commitment of the government to economic reform. Formidable\r\n  obstacles stand in the way of Madagascar's realizing its\r\n  considerable growth potential; the extent of government reforms,\r\n  outside financial aid, and foreign investment will be key\r\n  determinants.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$10.3 billion (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 3% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$730 (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 32%\r\n  industry: 13%\r\n  services: 55% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 2.3%\r\n  highest 10%: 34.9% (1993)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 4.5% (1997)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 7 million (1995)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $477 million\r\n  expenditures: $706 million, including capital expenditures of $264\r\n  million (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: meat processing, soap, breweries, tanneries, sugar,\r\n  textiles, glassware, cement, automobile assembly plant, paper,\r\n  petroleum, tourism\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 3.8% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 595 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 41.18%\r\n  hydro: 58.82%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 595 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: coffee, vanilla, sugarcane, cloves, cocoa,\r\n  rice, cassava (tapioca), beans, bananas, peanuts;

Over 90% of government tax revenue comes from\r\n  import duties and tourism-related taxes. About 350,000 tourists\r\n  visited the islands in 1997. Fishing is a second leading growth\r\n  sector. The Maldivian Government began an economic reform program in\r\n  1989 initially by lifting import quotas and opening some exports to\r\n  the private sector. Subsequently, it has liberalized regulations to\r\n  allow more foreign investment. Agriculture and manufacturing\r\n  continue to play a minor role in the economy, constrained by the\r\n  limited availability of cultivable land and the shortage of domestic\r\n  labor. Most staple foods must be imported. Industry, which consists\r\n  mainly of garment production, boat building, and handicrafts,\r\n  accounts for about 15% of GDP.

Economic\r\n  activity is largely confined to the riverine area irrigated by the\r\n  Niger. About 10% of the population is nomadic and some 80% of the\r\n  labor force is engaged in farming and fishing. Industrial activity\r\n  is concentrated on processing farm commodities. Mali is heavily\r\n  dependent on foreign aid and vulnerable to fluctuations in world\r\n  prices for cotton, its main export. In 1997, the government\r\n  continued its successful implementation of an IMF-recommended\r\n  structural adjustment program that is helping the economy grow,\r\n  diversify, and attract foreign investment. Mali's adherence to\r\n  economic reform, and the 50% devaluation of the African franc in\r\n  January 1994, has pushed up economic growth. Several multinational\r\n  corporations increased gold mining operations in 1996-98, and the\r\n  government anticipates that Mali will become a major Sub-Saharan\r\n  gold exporter in the next few years. Annual growth thus may fall in\r\n  the 5% range in 1999-2000, and inflation held to 5% or less.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$8 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 4.6% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$790 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 49%\r\n  industry: 17%\r\n  services: 34% (1995)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 5% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: NA\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture and fishing 80% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $730 million\r\n  expenditures: $770 million, including capital expenditures of $320\r\n  million (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: minor local consumer goods production and food\r\n  processing;

Malta\r\n  produces only about 20% of its food needs, has limited freshwater\r\n  supplies, and has no domestic energy sources. The economy is\r\n  dependent on foreign trade, manufacturing (especially electronics\r\n  and textiles), and tourism; the state-owned Malta drydocks employs\r\n  about 3,800 people. In 1998, almost 1 million tourists visited the\r\n  island. Per capita GDP of roughly $13,000 places Malta in the ranks\r\n  of the less affluent EU countries. The island is divided politically\r\n  over the question of joining the EU. The sizable budget deficit\r\n  remains a key concern.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$5 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 4% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$13,000 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 3%\r\n  industry: 26%\r\n  services: 71% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 2.8% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 148,085 (September 1996)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: public services 34%, other services\r\n  32%, manufacturing and construction 22%, agriculture 2% (1996)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 5% (1997)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $1.32 billion\r\n  expenditures: $1.76 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: tourism;

Agricultural production is concentrated on\r\n  small farms, and the most important commercial crops are coconuts,\r\n  tomatoes, melons, and breadfruit. Small-scale industry is limited to\r\n  handicrafts, fish processing, and copra. The tourist industry, now a\r\n  small source of foreign exchange employing less than 10% of the\r\n  labor force, remains the best hope for future added income. The\r\n  islands have few natural resources, and imports far exceed exports.\r\n  Under the terms of the Compact of Free Association, the US provides\r\n  roughly $65 million in annual aid, equal to about 70% of GDP.\r\n  Negotiations will get underway in 1999 for an extended agreement.\r\n  Government downsizing, drought, a drop in construction, and the\r\n  decline in tourism and foreign investment due to the Asian financial\r\n  difficulties have caused GDP to fall in 1996-98.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$91 million (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: -5% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$1,450 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 15%\r\n  industry: 13%\r\n  services: 72% (1995)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 5% (1997)\r\n\r\nLabor force: NA\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: NA\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 16% (1991 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $80.1 million\r\n  expenditures: $77.4 million, including capital expenditures of $19.5\r\n  million (FY95/96 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: copra, fish, tourism, craft items from shell, wood,\r\n  and pearls, offshore banking (embryonic)\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 57 million kWh (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: NA%\r\n  hydro: NA%\r\n  nuclear: NA%\r\n  other: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 57 million kWh (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1994)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: coconuts, cacao, taro, breadfruit, fruits;\r\n  pigs, chickens\r\n\r\nExports: $17.5 million (f.o.b., 1996 est.)\r\n\r\nExports--commodities: fish, coconut oil, fish, trochus shells\r\n\r\nExports--partners: US, Japan, Australia\r\n\r\nImports: $71.8 million (c.i.f., 1996 est.)\r\n\r\nImports--commodities: foodstuffs, machinery and equipment, fuels,\r\n  beverages and tobacco\r\n\r\nImports--partners: US, Japan, Australia, NZ\r\n\r\nDebt--external: $125 million (FY96/97 est.)\r\n\r\nEconomic aid--recipient: $NA;

Agriculture accounts for about 6% of\r\n  GDP and the small industrial sector for 11%. Sugar production has\r\n  declined, with most of the sugarcane now used for the production of\r\n  rum. Banana exports are increasing, going mostly to France. The bulk\r\n  of meat, vegetable, and grain requirements must be imported,\r\n  contributing to a chronic trade deficit that requires large annual\r\n  transfers of aid from France.

Mauritania has extensive\r\n  deposits of iron ore, which account for almost 50% of total exports.\r\n  The decline in world demand for this ore, however, has led to\r\n  cutbacks in production. The nation's coastal waters are among the\r\n  richest fishing areas in the world, but overexploitation by\r\n  foreigners threatens this key source of revenue. The country's first\r\n  deepwater port opened near Nouakchott in 1986. In recent years,\r\n  drought and economic mismanagement have resulted in a substantial\r\n  buildup of foreign debt. The government has begun the second stage\r\n  of an economic reform program in consultation with the World Bank,\r\n  the IMF, and major donor countries. Short-term growth prospects are\r\n  uncertain because of the heavy debt service burden, rapid population\r\n  growth, and vulnerability to climatic conditions.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$4.7 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 4.2% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$1,890 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 26%\r\n  industry: 31%\r\n  services: 43% (1996)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: 57% (1990 est.)\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 0.7%\r\n  highest 10%: 30.4% (1988)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 4.7% (1996)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 465,000 (1981 est.);

For most of the period, annual growth\r\n  has been of the order of 5% to 6%. This remarkable achievement has\r\n  been reflected in increased life expectancy, lowered infant\r\n  mortality, and a much improved infrastructure. Sugarcane is grown on\r\n  about 90% of the cultivated land area and accounts for 25% of export\r\n  earnings. The government's development strategy centers on\r\n  industrialization (with a view to modernization and to exports),\r\n  agricultural diversification, and tourism.

The number of state-owned\r\n  enterprises in Mexico has fallen from more than 1,000 in 1982 to\r\n  fewer than 200 in 1998. The ZEDILLO administration is privatizing\r\n  and expanding competition in sea ports, railroads,\r\n  telecommunications, electricity, natural gas distribution, and\r\n  airports. A strong export sector helped to cushion the economy's\r\n  decline in 1995 and led the recovery in 1996 and 1997. In 1998,\r\n  private consumption became the leading driver of growth, which was\r\n  accompanied by increased employment and higher wages. The government\r\n  expects the economy to slow in 1999 because of low commodity prices,\r\n  tighter international liquidity, and slacker demand for exports.\r\n  Mexico still needs to overcome many structural problems as it\r\n  strives to modernize its economy and raise living standards. Income\r\n  distribution is very unequal, with the top 20% of income earners\r\n  accounting for 55% of income. Trade with the US and Canada has\r\n  nearly doubled since NAFTA was implemented in 1994. Mexico is\r\n  pursuing additional trade agreements with most countries in Latin\r\n  America and with the EU to lessen its dependence on the US.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$815.3 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 4.8% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$8,300 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 6%\r\n  industry: 26%\r\n  services: 68% (1997)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: 27% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 1.8%\r\n  highest 10%: 36.6% 1996)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 18.6% (1998)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 37.5 million (1998)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: services 28.8%, agriculture, forestry,\r\n  hunting, and fishing 21.8%, commerce 17.1%, manufacturing 16.1%,\r\n  construction 5.2%, public administration and national defense 4.4%,\r\n  transportation and communications 4.1%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 2.6% (1998) urban;

As a result, the economy\r\n  depends heavily on agriculture, featuring fruits, vegetables, wine,\r\n  and tobacco. Moldova must import all of its supplies of oil, coal,\r\n  and natural gas, largely from Russia. Energy shortages contributed\r\n  to sharp production declines after the breakup of the Soviet Union\r\n  in 1991. The Moldovan Government has recently been making progress\r\n  on an ambitious economic reform agenda. As part of its reform\r\n  efforts, Moldova introduced a stable convertible currency, freed all\r\n  prices, stopped issuing preferential credits to state enterprises\r\n  and backed steady land privatization, removed export controls, and\r\n  freed interest rates. In 1998, the economic troubles of Russia, with\r\n  whom Moldova conducts 55% of its trade, was a major cause of the\r\n  8.6% drop in GDP. In 1999, the IMF resumed payment on Moldova's\r\n  Extended Fund Facility, which had been suspended since 1997. The IMF\r\n  intends to grant $135 million in 1999.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$10 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: -8.6% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$2,200 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 30%\r\n  industry: 29%\r\n  services: 41% (1997)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 2.7%\r\n  highest 10%: 25.8% (1992)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 18.3% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 1.7 million (1998)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture 40.2%, industry 14.3%,\r\n  other 45.5% (1998)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 2% (includes only officially registered\r\n  unemployed;

The Principality has successfully sought to\r\n  diversify into services and small, high-value-added, nonpolluting\r\n  industries. The state has no income tax and low business taxes and\r\n  thrives as a tax haven both for individuals who have established\r\n  residence and for foreign companies that have set up businesses and\r\n  offices. The state retains monopolies in a number of sectors,\r\n  including tobacco, the telephone network, and the postal service.\r\n  About 55% of Monaco's annual revenue comes from value-added taxes on\r\n  hotels, banks, and the industrial sector. Living standards are high,\r\n  roughly comparable to those in prosperous French metropolitan areas.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$800 million (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$25,000 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NA%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): NA%\r\n\r\nLabor force: 30,540 (January 1994)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 3.1% (1994)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $518 million\r\n  expenditures: $531 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1995)\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: NA kWh\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: NA%\r\n  hydro: NA%\r\n  nuclear: NA%\r\n  other: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: NA kWh\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: NA kWh\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: NA kWh\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: none\r\n\r\nExports: $NA;

Mongolia's severe climate,\r\n  scattered population, and wide expanses of unproductive land,\r\n  however, have constrained economic development. Economic activity\r\n  traditionally has been based on agriculture and the breeding of\r\n  livestock. In past years, extensive mineral resources had been\r\n  developed with Soviet support; total Soviet assistance at its height\r\n  amounted to 30% of GDP, but disappeared almost overnight in 1990-91.\r\n  The mining and processing of coal, copper, molybdenum, tin,\r\n  tungsten, and gold account for a large part of industrial\r\n  production. The Mongolian leadership has been soliciting support\r\n  from foreign donors and economic growth picked up in 1997 and 1998\r\n  after stalling in 1996 due to a series of natural disasters and\r\n  declines in world prices of copper and cashmere.

A\r\n  catastrophic eruption in June 1997 closed the air and sea ports,\r\n  causing further economic and social dislocation. Two-thirds of the\r\n  12,000 inhabitants fled the island. Some began to return in 1998,\r\n  but lack of housing limited the number. The agriculture sector\r\n  continued to be affected by the lack of suitable land for farming\r\n  and the destruction of crops. Construction was the dominant activity\r\n  in 1997 and 1998. GDP probably declined again in 1998. Prospects for\r\n  the economy depend largely on developments in relation to the\r\n  volcano and on public sector construction activity. The UK has\r\n  committed about $100 million in 1996-98 to help reconstruct the\r\n  economy.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$36 million (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: -18.5% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$NA\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 5.4%\r\n  industry: 13.6%\r\n  services: 81% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 5% (1997)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 4,521 (1992);

Since the early 1980s the\r\n  government has pursued an economic program toward these objectives\r\n  with the support of the IMF, the World Bank, and the Paris Club of\r\n  creditors. The dirham is now fully convertible for current account\r\n  transactions; reforms of the financial sector have been implemented;\r\n  and state enterprises are slowly being privatized. Drought\r\n  conditions in 1997 depressed activity in the key agricultural\r\n  sector, holding down exports and contributing to a 2.2% contraction\r\n  in real GDP. Favorable rainfalls in the fall of 1997 have led to\r\n  6.8% real GDP growth in 1998. Growth is forecast to be about 4.0% in\r\n  1999. Formidable long-term challenges include: servicing the\r\n  external debt; preparing the economy for freer trade with the EU;\r\n  and improving education and attracting foreign investment to improve\r\n  living standards and job propects for Morocco's youthful population.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$107 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 6.8% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$3,200 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 14%\r\n  industry: 33%\r\n  services: 53% (1997)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: 13.1% (1990-91 est.)\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 2.8%\r\n  highest 10%: 30.5% (1990-91)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 2%-3% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 11 million (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture 50%, services 26%,\r\n  industry 15%, other 9% (1985)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 19% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $8.4 billion\r\n  expenditures: $10 billion, including capital expenditures of $1.8\r\n  billion (FY97/98 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: phosphate rock mining and processing, food\r\n  processing, leather goods, textiles, construction, tourism\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 4.1% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 11.5 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 95.65%\r\n  hydro: 4.35%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 12.52 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 1.02 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: barley, wheat, citrus, wine, vegetables,\r\n  olives;

In 1994, it ranked as one of the poorest\r\n  countries in the world. Since then, Mozambique has undertaken a\r\n  series of economic reforms. Almost all aspects of the economy have\r\n  been liberalized to some extent. More than 900 state enterprises\r\n  have been privatized. Pending are tax and much needed commercial\r\n  code reform, as well as greater private sector involvement in the\r\n  transportation, telecommunications, and energy sectors. Since 1996,\r\n  inflation has been low and foreign exchange rates stable. Albeit\r\n  from a small base, Mozambique achieved one of the highest growth\r\n  rates in the world in 1997-98. Still, the country depends on foreign\r\n  assistance to balance the budget and to pay for a trade imbalance in\r\n  which imports outnumber exports by three to one. The medium-term\r\n  outlook for the country looks bright, as trade and transportation\r\n  links to South Africa and the rest of the region are expected to\r\n  improve and sizable foreign investments materialize.

Mining accounts\r\n  for 20% of GDP. Namibia is the fourth-largest exporter of nonfuel\r\n  minerals in Africa and the world's fifth-largest producer of\r\n  uranium. Rich alluvial diamond deposits make Namibia a primary\r\n  source for gem-quality diamonds. Namibia also produces large\r\n  quantities of lead, zinc, tin, silver, and tungsten. Half of the\r\n  population depends on agriculture (largely subsistence agriculture)\r\n  for its livelihood. Namibia must import some of its food. Although\r\n  per capita GDP is three times the per capita GDP of Africa's poorer\r\n  countries, the majority of Namibia's people live in pronounced\r\n  poverty because of the great inequality of income distribution and\r\n  the large amounts going to foreigners. The Namibian economy has\r\n  close links to South Africa.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$6.6 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 2% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$4,100 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 11%\r\n  industry: 34%\r\n  services: 55% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 7% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 500,000\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture 49%, industry and commerce\r\n  25%, services 5%, government 18%, mining 3% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 30% to 40%, including underemployment (1997\r\n  est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $1.1 billion\r\n  expenditures: $1.2 billion, including capital expenditures of $193\r\n  million (FY96/97 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: meat packing, fish processing, dairy products;

Phosphates\r\n  have given Nauruans one of the highest per capita incomes in the\r\n  Third World. Few other resources exist, thus most necessities must\r\n  be imported, including fresh water from Australia. The\r\n  rehabilitation of mined land and the replacement of income from\r\n  phosphates are serious long-term problems. Substantial amounts of\r\n  phosphate income are invested in trust funds to help cushion the\r\n  transition. The government also has been borrowing heavily from the\r\n  trusts to finance fiscal deficits. To cut costs the government has\r\n  called a freezing of wages, a reduction of over-staffed public\r\n  service departments, privatization of numerous government agencies,\r\n  and closure of some overseas consulates.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$100 million (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$10,000 (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NA%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): -3.6% (1993)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: employed in mining phosphates, public\r\n  administration, education, and transportation\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 0%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $23.4 million\r\n  expenditures: $64.8 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (FY95/96)\r\n\r\nIndustries: phosphate mining, financial services, coconut products\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 32 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 100%\r\n  hydro: 0%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 32 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: coconuts\r\n\r\nExports: $25.3 million (f.o.b., 1991)\r\n\r\nExports--commodities: phosphates\r\n\r\nExports--partners: Australia, NZ\r\n\r\nImports: $21.1 million (c.i.f., 1991)\r\n\r\nImports--commodities: food, fuel, manufactures, building\r\n  materials, machinery\r\n\r\nImports--partners: Australia, UK, NZ, Japan\r\n\r\nDebt--external: $33.3 million\r\n\r\nEconomic aid--recipient: $2.5 million (1995);

Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy,\r\n  providing a livelihood for over 80% of the population and accounting\r\n  for 41% of GDP. Industrial activity mainly involves the processing\r\n  of agricultural produce including jute, sugarcane, tobacco, and\r\n  grain. Production of textiles and carpets has expanded recently and\r\n  accounted for about 80% of foreign exchange earnings in the past\r\n  three years. Apart from agricultural land and forests, exploitable\r\n  natural resources are mica, hydropower, and tourism. Agricultural\r\n  production is growing by about 5% on average as compared with annual\r\n  population growth of 2.5%. Since May 1991, the government has been\r\n  moving forward with economic reforms particularly those that\r\n  encourage trade and foreign investment, e.g., by eliminating\r\n  business licenses and registration requirements in order to simplify\r\n  investment procedures. The government has also been cutting\r\n  expenditures by reducing subsidies, privatizing state industries,\r\n  and laying off civil servants. More recently, however, political\r\n  instability--five different governments over the past few years--has\r\n  hampered Kathmandu's ability to forge consensus to implement key\r\n  economic reforms. Nepal has considerable scope for accelerating\r\n  economic growth by exploiting its potential in hydropower and\r\n  tourism, areas of recent foreign investment interest. Prospects for\r\n  foreign trade or investment in other sectors will remain poor,\r\n  however, because of the small size of the economy, its technological\r\n  backwardness, its remoteness, its landlocked geographic location,\r\n  and its susceptibility to natural disaster. The international\r\n  community's role of funding more than 60% of Nepal's development\r\n  budget and more than 28% of total budgetary expenditures will likely\r\n  continue as a major ingredient of growth.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$26.2 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 4.9% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$1,100 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 41%\r\n  industry: 22%\r\n  services: 37% (1997)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: 42% (1995-96 est.)\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 3.2%\r\n  highest 10%: 29.8% (1995-96)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 7.8% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 10 million (1996 est.)\r\n  note: severe lack of skilled labor\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture 81%, services 16%,\r\n  industry 3%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%;

Industrial activity features food\r\n  processing, petroleum refining, and metalworking. The highly\r\n  mechanized agricultural sector employs only 4% of the labor force,\r\n  but provides large surpluses for export and the domestic\r\n  food-processing industry. As a result, the Netherlands ranks third\r\n  worldwide in value of agricultural exports, behind the US and\r\n  France. Sharp cuts in subsidy and social security spending since the\r\n  1980s helped the Dutch achieve sustained economic growth combined\r\n  with falling unemployment and moderate inflation. The economy\r\n  achieved a strong 3.7% growth in 1998; a dip in the business cycle\r\n  probably will cause the economy to decelerate to slightly over 2%\r\n  growth in 1999. Unemployment in 1999 is expected to be less than 5%\r\n  of the labor force, and inflation probably will decline. The Dutch\r\n  joined the first wave of 11 EU countries launching the euro system\r\n  on 1 January 1999.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$348.6 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 3.7% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$22,200 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 3.2%\r\n  industry: 27.5%\r\n  services: 69.3% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 2.9%\r\n  highest 10%: 24.7% (1991)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 2% (1998)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 7 million (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: services 73%, manufacturing and\r\n  construction 23%, agriculture 4% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 4.1% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $163 billion\r\n  expenditures: $170 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1999 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: agroindustries, metal and engineering products,\r\n  electrical machinery and equipment, chemicals, petroleum,\r\n  construction, microelectronics, fishing\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 2.4% (1998)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 83.3 billion kWh (1997)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 94.51%\r\n  hydro: 0.1%\r\n  nuclear: 4.95%\r\n  other: 0.44% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 90.366 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 700 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 11.3 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: grains, potatoes, sugar beets, fruits,\r\n  vegetables;

In recent years, the economy has suffered\r\n  because of depressed international demand for nickel, the principal\r\n  source of export earnings. Only a negligible amount of the land is\r\n  suitable for cultivation, and food accounts for about 25% of\r\n  imports. In addition to nickel, financial support from France and\r\n  tourism are key to the health of the economy. Performance in 1998\r\n  was hampered by the spillover of financial problems in East Asia and\r\n  by lower expected prices for nickel.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$2.1 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$11,400 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 3%\r\n  industry: 25%\r\n  services: 72% (1996)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 1.7% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 70,044 (1988)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture 20%, industry 16%,\r\n  services 60%, mining 4% (1996)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 15% (1994)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $755.6 million\r\n  expenditures: $755.6 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: nickel mining and smelting\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 1.145 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 69.87%\r\n  hydro: 30.13%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 1.145 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: vegetables;

This\r\n  dynamic growth has boosted real incomes, broadened and deepened the\r\n  technological capabilities of the industrial sector, and contained\r\n  inflationary pressures. Inflation remains among the lowest in the\r\n  industrial world. Per capita GDP has been moving up toward the\r\n  levels of the big West European economies. New Zealand's heavy\r\n  dependence on trade leaves its growth prospects vulnerable to\r\n  economic performance in Asia, Europe, and the US. The slump in\r\n  demand in Asian markets largely explains the slight drop in GDP in\r\n  1998.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$61.1 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: -0.2% (1998)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$17,000 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 9%\r\n  industry: 25%\r\n  services: 66% (1997)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 1.1% (1998)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 1.86 million (1998)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: services 65.1%, industry 25.1%,\r\n  agriculture 9.8% (1995)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 7.6% (1998)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $24.9 billion\r\n  expenditures: $23.7 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (FY97/98 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: food processing, wood and paper products, textiles,\r\n  machinery, transportation equipment, banking and insurance, tourism,\r\n  mining\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 35.534 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 18.72%\r\n  hydro: 75.67%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 5.61% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 35.534 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: wheat, barley, potatoes, pulses, fruits,\r\n  vegetables;

The\r\n  storm has put the reform effort on hold and has changed economic\r\n  forecasts for the foreseeable future--Nicaragua, the poorest country\r\n  in Central America was one of the hardest hit by the hurricane.\r\n  Nicaragua sustained approximately $1 billion in damages and will\r\n  probably see GDP growth slow by at least one percentage point in\r\n  1999. Hardest hit was the all-important agriculture sector, which is\r\n  responsible for the majority of exports. As a result, the trade\r\n  deficit is likely to balloon in 1999 to roughly $900 million.\r\n  Significant aid and relief have helped to stabilize the country. In\r\n  addition, the Paris Club and other creditors have offered\r\n  substantial debt relief. Nevertheless, additional financing will be\r\n  needed to restore the economy to its pre-Mitch condition.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$11.6 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 4% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$2,500 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 32%\r\n  industry: 24%\r\n  services: 44% (1997)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: 50.3% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 1.6%\r\n  highest 10%: 39.8% (1993)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 16% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 1.5 million\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: services 54%, agriculture 31%,\r\n  industry 15% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 14%;

Nigeria's unpopular military rulers have failed to make\r\n  significant progress in diversifying the economy away from\r\n  overdependence on the capital intensive oil sector which provides\r\n  30% of GDP, 95% of foreign exchange earnings, and about 80% of\r\n  budgetary revenues. The government's resistance to initiating\r\n  greater transparency and accountability in managing the country's\r\n  multibillion dollar oil earnings continues to limit economic growth\r\n  and prevent an agreement with the IMF and bilateral creditors on a\r\n  staff-monitored program and debt relief. The largely subsistence\r\n  agricultural sector has failed to keep up with rapid population\r\n  growth, and Nigeria, once a large net exporter of food, now must\r\n  import food. Growth in 1999 may become negative because of continued\r\n  low oil prices and persistent inefficiencies in the system.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$106.2 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 1.6% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$960 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 33%\r\n  industry: 42%\r\n  services: 25% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: 34.1% (1992-93 est.)\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 1.3%\r\n  highest 10%: 31.4% (1992-93)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 15% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 42.844 million\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture 54%, industry, commerce,\r\n  and services 19%, government 15%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 28% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $13.9 billion (1998 est.)\r\n  expenditures: $13.9 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: crude oil, coal, tin, columbite, palm oil, peanuts,\r\n  cotton, rubber, wood, hides and skins, textiles, cement and other\r\n  construction materials, food products, footwear, chemicals,\r\n  fertilizer, printing, ceramics, steel\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 4.1% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 13.78 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 60.94%\r\n  hydro: 39.06%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 13.74 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 50 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: cocoa, peanuts, palm oil, corn, rice,\r\n  sorghum, millet, cassava (tapioca), yams, rubber;

Government expenditures regularly exceed revenues, and the\r\n  shortfall is made up by grants from New Zealand which are used to\r\n  pay wages to public employees. Niue has cut government expenditures\r\n  by reducing the public service by almost half. The agricultural\r\n  sector consists mainly of subsistence gardening, although some cash\r\n  crops are grown for export. Industry consists primarily of small\r\n  factories to process passion fruit, lime oil, honey, and coconut\r\n  cream. The sale of postage stamps to foreign collectors is an\r\n  important source of revenue. The island in recent years has suffered\r\n  a serious loss of population because of migration of Niueans to New\r\n  Zealand.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$2.4 million (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$1,200 (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NA%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 5% (1992)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 450 (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: most work on family plantations;

The\r\n  commonwealth received $27.7 million from FY93/94 through FY95/96.\r\n  For FY96/97 through FY02/03, funding of $11 million will be provided\r\n  for infrastructure, with an equal local match. A rapidly growing\r\n  chief source of income is the tourist industry, which now employs\r\n  about 50% of the work force. Japanese tourists predominate. The\r\n  agricultural sector is of minor importance and is made up of cattle\r\n  ranches and small farms producing coconuts, breadfruit, tomatoes,\r\n  and melons. Garment production is the fastest growing industry with\r\n  employment of 12,000 mostly Chinese workers and shipments of $1\r\n  billion to the US in 1998 under duty and quota exemptions.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$524 million (1996 est.)\r\n  note: GDP numbers reflect US spending\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$9,300 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NA%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 6.5% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 6,006 total indigenous labor force; 2,699\r\n  unemployed; 28,717 foreign workers (1995)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: managerial 20.5%, technical, sales\r\n  16.4%, services 19.3%, farming 3.1%, precision production 13.8%,\r\n  operators, fabricators 26.9%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 14% (residents)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $221 million\r\n  expenditures: $213 million, including capital expenditures of $17.7\r\n  million (1996)\r\n\r\nIndustries: tourism, construction, garments, handicrafts\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: NA kWh\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 100%\r\n  hydro: NA%\r\n  nuclear: NA%\r\n  other: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: NA kWh\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: NA kWh\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: NA kWh\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: coconuts, fruits, vegetables; cattle\r\n\r\nExports: $1 billion (1998)\r\n\r\nExports--commodities: garments\r\n\r\nExports--partners: US\r\n\r\nImports: $NA\r\n\r\nImports--commodities: food, construction equipment and materials,\r\n  petroleum products\r\n\r\nImports--partners: US, Japan\r\n\r\nDebt--external: $NA\r\n\r\nEconomic aid--recipient: $21.1 million (1995)\r\n\r\nCurrency: 1 United States dollar (US$) = 100 cents\r\n\r\nExchange rates: US currency is used\r\n\r\nFiscal year: 1 October--30 September\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunications\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTelephones: 13,618 (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nTelephone system:\r\n  domestic: NA\r\n  international: satellite earth stations--2 Intelsat (Pacific Ocean)\r\n\r\nRadio broadcast stations: AM 2, FM 3\r\n\r\nRadios: 15,460 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nTelevision broadcast stations: 1 (on Saipan and one station\r\n  planned for Rota; in addition, two cable stations on Saipan provide\r\n  varied programming from satellite networks) (1997)\r\n\r\nTelevisions: 15,460 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTransportation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRailways: 0 km\r\n\r\nHighways:\r\n  total: 362 km (1991 est.)\r\n  paved: NA km\r\n  unpaved: NA km\r\n\r\nWaterways: none\r\n\r\nPorts and harbors: Saipan, Tinian\r\n\r\nMerchant marine: none\r\n\r\nAirports: 5 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nAirports--with paved runways:\r\n  total: 3\r\n  2,438 to 3,047 m: 1\r\n  1,524 to 2,437 m: 2 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nAirports--with unpaved runways:\r\n  total: 2\r\n  2,438 to 3,047 m: 1\r\n  under 914 m: 1 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nHeliports: 1 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMilitary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMilitary--note: defense is the responsibility of the US\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTransnational Issues\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDisputes--international: none\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n======================================================================\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n@Norway\r\n------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBackground: Norway gained its independence from Sweden in 1905.\r\n  As a separate realm, Norway stayed free of World War I but suffered\r\n  German occupation in World War II.

The economy consists of a combination of free market\r\n  activity and government intervention. The government controls key\r\n  areas, such as the vital petroleum sector (through large-scale state\r\n  enterprises), and extensively subsidizes agriculture, fishing, and\r\n  areas with sparse resources. Norway maintains an extensive welfare\r\n  system that helps propel public sector expenditures to more than 50%\r\n  of GDP and results in one of the highest average tax levels in the\r\n  world. A major shipping nation, with a high dependence on\r\n  international trade, Norway is basically an exporter of raw\r\n  materials and semiprocessed goods. The country is richly endowed\r\n  with natural resources--petroleum, hydropower, fish, forests, and\r\n  minerals--and is highly dependent on its oil production and\r\n  international oil prices. Only Saudi Arabia exports more oil than\r\n  Norway. Norway imports more than half its food needs. Oslo opted to\r\n  stay out of the EU during a referendum in November 1994. Economic\r\n  growth in 1999 should drop to about 1%. Despite their high per\r\n  capita income and generous welfare benefits, Norwegians worry about\r\n  that time in the 21st century when the oil and gas run out.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$109 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 2.4% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$24,700 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 2%\r\n  industry: 30%\r\n  services: 68% (1997)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 4.1%\r\n  highest 10%: 21.2% (1991)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 2.3% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 2.3 million (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: services 71%, industry 23%,\r\n  agriculture, forestry, and fishing 6% (1993)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 2.6% (yearend 1997)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $48.6 billion\r\n  expenditures: $53 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: petroleum and gas, food processing, shipbuilding,\r\n  pulp and paper products, metals, chemicals, timber, mining,\r\n  textiles, fishing\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 2.7% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 103.374 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 0.76%\r\n  hydro: 99.23%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0.01% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 112.374 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 4.2 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 13.2 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: oats, other grains;

the largest\r\n  ocean (followed by the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the\r\n  Arctic Ocean); covers about one-third of the global surface; larger\r\n  than the total land area of the world\r\n\r\nCoastline: 135,663 km\r\n\r\nClimate: planetary air pressure systems and resultant wind\r\n  patterns exhibit remarkable uniformity in the south and east; trade\r\n  winds and westerly winds are well-developed patterns, modified by\r\n  seasonal fluctuations; tropical cyclones (hurricanes) may form south\r\n  of Mexico from June to October and affect Mexico and Central\r\n  America; continental influences cause climatic uniformity to be much\r\n  less pronounced in the eastern and western regions at the same\r\n  latitude in the North Pacific Ocean; the western Pacific is\r\n  monsoonal--a rainy season occurs during the summer months, when\r\n  moisture-laden winds blow from the ocean over the land, and a dry\r\n  season during the winter months, when dry winds blow from the Asian\r\n  landmass back to the ocean; tropical cyclones (typhoons) may strike\r\n  southeast and east Asia from May to December\r\n\r\nTerrain: surface currents in the northern Pacific are dominated\r\n  by a clockwise, warm-water gyre (broad circular system of currents)\r\n  and in the southern Pacific by a counterclockwise, cool-water gyre;\r\n  in the northern Pacific, sea ice forms in the Bering Sea and Sea of\r\n  Okhotsk in winter; in the southern Pacific, sea ice from Antarctica\r\n  reaches its northernmost extent in October; the ocean floor in the\r\n  eastern Pacific is dominated by the East Pacific Rise, while the\r\n  western Pacific is dissected by deep trenches, including the Mariana\r\n  Trench, which is the world's deepest\r\n\r\nElevation extremes:\r\n  lowest point: Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench -10,924 m\r\n  highest point: sea level 0 m\r\n\r\nNatural resources: oil and gas fields, polymetallic nodules, sand\r\n  and gravel aggregates, placer deposits, fish\r\n\r\nNatural hazards: surrounded by a zone of violent volcanic and\r\n  earthquake activity sometimes referred to as the \"Pacific Ring of\r\n  Fire\"; subject to tropical cyclones (typhoons) in southeast and east\r\n  Asia from May to December (most frequent from July to October);\r\n  tropical cyclones (hurricanes) may form south of Mexico and strike\r\n  Central America and Mexico from June to October (most common in\r\n  August and September); southern shipping lanes subject to icebergs\r\n  from Antarctica; cyclical El Nino phenomenon occurs off the coast of\r\n  Peru, when the trade winds slacken and the warm Equatorial\r\n  countercurrent moves south, killing the plankton that is the primary\r\n  food source for anchovies; consequently, the anchovies move to\r\n  better feeding grounds, causing resident marine birds to starve by\r\n  the thousands because of the loss of their food source; ships\r\n  subject to superstructure icing in extreme north from October to May\r\n  and in extreme south from May to October; persistent fog in the\r\n  northern Pacific can be a maritime hazard from June to December\r\n\r\nEnvironment--current issues: endangered marine species include the\r\n  dugong, sea lion, sea otter, seals, turtles, and whales; oil\r\n  pollution in Philippine Sea and South China Sea\r\n\r\nEnvironment--international agreements:\r\n  party to: none of the selected agreements\r\n  signed, but not ratified: none of the selected agreements\r\n\r\nGeography--note: the major chokepoints are the Bering Strait,\r\n  Panama Canal, Luzon Strait, and the Singapore Strait; the Equator\r\n  divides the Pacific Ocean into the North Pacific Ocean and the South\r\n  Pacific Ocean; dotted with low coral islands and rugged volcanic\r\n  islands in the southwestern Pacific Ocean\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nData code: none;

It provides low-cost sea transportation between East and\r\n  West, extensive fishing grounds, offshore oil and gas fields,\r\n  minerals, and sand and gravel for the construction industry. In\r\n  1996, over 60% of the world's fish catch came from the Pacific\r\n  Ocean. Exploitation of offshore oil and gas reserves is playing an\r\n  ever-increasing role in the energy supplies of Australia, NZ, China,\r\n  US, and Peru. The high cost of recovering offshore oil and gas,\r\n  combined with the wide swings in world prices for oil since 1985,\r\n  has slowed but not stopped new drillings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunications\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTelephone system:\r\n  international: several submarine cables with network nodal points on\r\n  Guam and Hawaii\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTransportation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPorts and harbors: Bangkok (Thailand), Hong Kong, Kao-hsiung\r\n  (Taiwan), Los Angeles (US), Manila (Philippines), Pusan (South\r\n  Korea), San Francisco (US), Seattle (US), Shanghai (China),\r\n  Singapore, Sydney (Australia), Vladivostok (Russia), Wellington\r\n  (NZ), Yokohama (Japan)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTransnational Issues\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDisputes--international: some maritime disputes (see littoral\r\n  states)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n======================================================================\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n@Pakistan\r\n--------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeography\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: Southern Asia, bordering the Arabian Sea, between India\r\n  on the east and Iran and Afghanistan on the west and China in the\r\n  north\r\n\r\nGeographic coordinates: 30 00 N, 70 00 E\r\n\r\nMap references: Asia\r\n\r\nArea:\r\n  total: 803,940 sq km\r\n  land: 778,720 sq km\r\n  water: 25,220 sq km\r\n\r\nArea--comparative: slightly less than twice the size of California\r\n\r\nLand boundaries:\r\n  total: 6,774 km\r\n  border countries: Afghanistan 2,430 km, China 523 km, India 2,912\r\n  km, Iran 909 km\r\n\r\nCoastline: 1,046 km\r\n\r\nMaritime claims:\r\n  contiguous zone: 24 nm\r\n  continental shelf: 200 nm or to the edge of the continental margin\r\n  exclusive economic zone: 200 nm\r\n  territorial sea: 12 nm\r\n\r\nClimate: mostly hot, dry desert; temperate in northwest; arctic\r\n  in north\r\n\r\nTerrain: flat Indus plain in east; mountains in north and\r\n  northwest; Balochistan plateau in west\r\n\r\nElevation extremes:\r\n  lowest point: Indian Ocean 0 m\r\n  highest point: K2 (Mt.

In January 1999, Islamabad received more than $1 billion in\r\n  loans along with $3 billion in debt relief following the Finance\r\n  Minister DAR's pledge to implement an economic reform program to\r\n  reduce the budget deficit, deepen the financial sector, and broaden\r\n  the industrial base. Although the economy has shown signs of\r\n  improvement following implementation of some corrective measures,\r\n  Prime Minister SHARIF--historically--has failed to implement the tough\r\n  structural reforms necessary for sustained, longer-term growth.

Since taking office in 1994, President PEREZ\r\n  BALLADARES has advanced an economic reform program designed to\r\n  liberalize the trade regime, attract foreign investment, privatize\r\n  state-owned enterprises, institute fiscal reform, and encourage job\r\n  creation through labor code reform. The government privatized its\r\n  two remaining ports along the Panama Canal in 1997 and approved the\r\n  sale of the railroad in early 1998. It also plans to sell other\r\n  assets, including the electric company. Panama joined the World\r\n  Trade Organization (WTrO) and approved a tariff reduction that will\r\n  give the country the lowest average tariff rates in Latin America. A\r\n  banking reform law was approved by the legislature in early 1998.\r\n  The most important sectors driving growth have been the Panama Canal\r\n  and other shipping and port activities.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$19.9 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 2.7% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$7,300 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 8%\r\n  industry: 18%\r\n  services: 74% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 0.5%\r\n  highest 10%: 42.5% (1991)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 1.4% (1998)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 1.044 million (1997 est.)\r\n  note: shortage of skilled labor, but an oversupply of unskilled labor\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: government and community services\r\n  31.8%, agriculture, hunting, and fishing 26.8%, commerce,\r\n  restaurants, and hotels 16.4%, manufacturing and mining 9.4%,\r\n  construction 3.2%, transportation and communications 6.2%, finance,\r\n  insurance, and real estate 4.3%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 13.1% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $2.4 billion\r\n  expenditures: $2.4 billion, including capital expenditures of $341\r\n  million (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: construction, petroleum refining, brewing, cement and\r\n  other construction materials, sugar milling\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 0.4% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 3.55 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 29.58%\r\n  hydro: 70.42%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 3.488 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 157 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 95 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: bananas, rice, corn, coffee, sugarcane,\r\n  vegetables;

Agriculture provides\r\n  a subsistence livelihood for the bulk of the population. Mineral\r\n  deposits, including oil, copper, and gold, account for 72% of export\r\n  earnings. Budgetary support from Australia and development aid under\r\n  World Bank auspices have helped sustain the economy. In 1995, Port\r\n  Moresby reached agreement with the IMF and World Bank on a\r\n  structural adjustment program, of which the first phase was\r\n  successfully completed in 1996. In 1997, droughts caused by the El\r\n  Nino weather pattern wreaked havoc on Papua New Guinea's coffee,\r\n  cocoa, and coconut production, the mainstays of the\r\n  agricultural-based economy and major sources of export earnings. The\r\n  coffee crop was slashed by up to 50% in 1997. Despite problems with\r\n  drought, the year 1998 saw a small recovery in GDP.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$11.1 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 1.6% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$2,400 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 28.2%\r\n  industry: 34.5%\r\n  services: 37.3% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 1.7%\r\n  highest 10%: 40.5% (1996)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 12% (FY97/98 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 1.941 million\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture 64% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $1.5 billion\r\n  expenditures: $1.35 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: copra crushing, palm oil processing, plywood\r\n  production, wood chip production;

The informal sector features both reexport of\r\n  imported consumer goods (electronics, whiskeys, perfumes,\r\n  cigarettes, and office equipment) to neighboring countries as well\r\n  as the activities of thousands of microenterprises and urban street\r\n  vendors. The formal sector is largely oriented toward services. A\r\n  large percentage of the population derive their living from\r\n  agricultural activity, often on a subsistence basis. The formal\r\n  economy has grown an average of about 3% over the past six years,\r\n  but GDP declined in 1998. However, population has increased at about\r\n  the same rate over the same period, leaving per capita income nearly\r\n  stagnant. The new government of Raul CUBAS Grau was pursuing an\r\n  economic reform agenda, albeit with limited success because of\r\n  in-fighting in the ruling party and resistance from the opposition.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$19.8 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: -0.5% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$3,700 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 27%\r\n  industry: 30%\r\n  services: 43% (1997)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: 21.8% (1991 est.)\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 0.7%\r\n  highest 10%: 46.6% (1995)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 14.6% (1998)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 1.8 million (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture 45%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 8.2% (urban) (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $1.25 billion\r\n  expenditures: $1.66 billion, including capital expenditures of $357\r\n  million (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: meat packing, oilseed crushing, milling, brewing,\r\n  textiles, other light consumer goods, cement, construction\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 5.1% (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 45.03 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 0.07%\r\n  hydro: 99.93%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 4.768 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 40.262 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: cotton, sugarcane, soybeans, corn, wheat,\r\n  tobacco, cassava (tapioca), fruits, vegetables;

An\r\n  austerity program implemented shortly after the FUJIMORI government\r\n  took office in July 1990 contributed to a short-lived contraction of\r\n  economic activity, but the slide came to a halt late that year, and\r\n  in 1991 output rose 2.4%. By working with the IMF and World Bank on\r\n  new financial conditions and arrangements, the government succeeded\r\n  in ending its arrears by March 1993. In 1992, GDP fell by 2.8%, in\r\n  part because a warmer-than-usual El Nino current resulted in a 30%\r\n  drop in the fish catch, but the economy rebounded as strong foreign\r\n  investment helped push growth to 7% in 1993, about 13% in 1994, and\r\n  6.8% in 1995. Growth slowed to 2.8% in 1996 as the government\r\n  adopted tight fiscal and monetary policy to reduce the current\r\n  account deficit and meet its IMF targets. Growth then rebounded to\r\n  7.3% in 1997 even as inflation fell to its lowest level in 23 years.\r\n  Capital inflows surged to record levels in early 1997 and have\r\n  remained strong. In 1998, El Nino's impact on agriculture, the\r\n  financial crisis in Asia, and instability in Brazilian markets\r\n  undercut growth.

The strategy includes\r\n  improving infrastructure, overhauling the tax system to bolster\r\n  government revenues, and moving toward further deregulation and\r\n  privatization of the economy.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$270.5 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: -0.5% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$3,500 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 20%\r\n  industry: 32%\r\n  services: 48% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: 32% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 2.4%\r\n  highest 10%: 33.5% (1994)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 9.7% (1998)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 31.3 million (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture 39.8%, government and\r\n  social services 19.4%, services 17.7%, manufacturing 9.8%,\r\n  construction 5.8%, other 7.5% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 9.6% (October 1998)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $14.5 billion\r\n  expenditures: $12.6 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: textiles, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, wood products,\r\n  food processing, electronics assembly, petroleum refining, fishing\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: -1.7% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 32.2 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 62.11%\r\n  hydro: 20.19%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 17.7% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 32.2 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: rice, coconuts, corn, sugarcane, bananas,\r\n  pineapples, mangoes;

The privatization of small\r\n  and medium state-owned companies and a liberal law on establishing\r\n  new firms marked the rapid development of a private sector now\r\n  responsible for 70% of economic activity. In contrast to the vibrant\r\n  expansion of private non-farm activity, the large agriculture\r\n  component remains handicapped by structural problems, surplus labor,\r\n  inefficient small farms, and lack of investment. The government's\r\n  determination to enter the EU as soon as possible affects all\r\n  aspects of its economic policies. Improving Poland's worsening\r\n  current account deficit also is a priority. To date, the government\r\n  has resisted pressure for protectionist solutions and continues to\r\n  support regional free trade initiatives. The government export\r\n  strategy emphasizes a more aggressive export assistance program.\r\n  Warsaw continues to hold the budget deficit to less than 2% of GDP.\r\n  Further progress on public finance depends mainly on comprehensive\r\n  reform of the social welfare system and privatization of Poland's\r\n  remaining state sector. Restructuring and privatization of\r\n  \"sensitive sectors\" (e.g., coal, steel, and telecommunications) has\r\n  begun.

Sugar production has lost out to\r\n  dairy production and other livestock products as the main source of\r\n  income in the agricultural sector. Tourism has traditionally been an\r\n  important source of income for the island, with estimated arrivals\r\n  of nearly 4 million tourists in 1993.

Proved oil reserves of 3.7 billion barrels\r\n  should ensure continued output at current levels for 23 years. Oil\r\n  has given Qatar a per capita GDP comparable to the leading West\r\n  European industrial countries. Qatar's proved reserves of natural\r\n  gas exceed 7 trillion cubic meters, more than 5% of the world total,\r\n  third largest in the world. Production and export of natural gas are\r\n  becoming increasingly important. Long-term goals feature the\r\n  development of off-shore petroleum and the diversification of the\r\n  economy. Lower world oil prices brought GDP down in 1998.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$12 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: -3% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$17,100 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 1%\r\n  industry: 49%\r\n  services: 50% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 7.4% (1996)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 233,000 (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $3.4 billion\r\n  expenditures: $4.3 billion, including capital expenditures of $700\r\n  million (FY98/99 budget est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: crude oil production and refining, fertilizers,\r\n  petrochemicals, steel reinforcing bars, cement\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: -4% (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 5.2 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 100%\r\n  hydro: 0%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 5.2 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: fruits, vegetables;

Sugarcane has been the primary crop for more than a\r\n  century, and in some years it accounts for 85% of exports. The\r\n  government has been pushing the development of a tourist industry to\r\n  relieve high unemployment, which recently amounted to one-third of\r\n  the labor force. The gap in Reunion between the well-off and the\r\n  poor is extraordinary and accounts for the persistent social\r\n  tensions. The white and Indian communities are substantially better\r\n  off than other segments of the population, often approaching\r\n  European standards, whereas indigenous groups suffer the poverty and\r\n  unemployment typical of the poorer nations of the African continent.\r\n  The outbreak of severe rioting in February 1991 illustrates the\r\n  seriousness of socioeconomic tensions. The economic well-being of\r\n  Reunion depends heavily on continued financial assistance from\r\n  France.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$3.4 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 3.8% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$4,800 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NA%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): NA%\r\n\r\nLabor force: 261,000 (1995)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture 8%, industry 19%, services\r\n  73% (1990)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 35% (1994)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $856.7 million\r\n  expenditures: $2.2437 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1993)\r\n\r\nIndustries: sugar, rum, cigarettes, handicraft items, flower oil\r\n  extraction\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 1.1 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 54.55%\r\n  hydro: 45.45%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 1.1 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: sugarcane, vanilla, tobacco, tropical\r\n  fruits, vegetables, corn\r\n\r\nExports: $171.78 million (f.o.b., 1994)\r\n\r\nExports--commodities: sugar 63%, rum and molasses 4%, perfume\r\n  essences 2%, lobster 3%, (1993)\r\n\r\nExports--partners: France 74%, Japan 6%, Comoros 4% (1994)\r\n\r\nImports: $2.35 billion (c.i.f., 1994)\r\n\r\nImports--commodities: manufactured goods, food, beverages,\r\n  tobacco, machinery and transportation equipment, raw materials, and\r\n  petroleum products\r\n\r\nImports--partners: France 67%, Bahrain 4%, Italy 3% (1994)\r\n\r\nDebt--external: $NA\r\n\r\nEconomic aid--recipient: $NA;

In\r\n  February 1997, Romania embarked on a comprehensive macroeconomic\r\n  stabilization and structural reform program, but reform subsequently\r\n  has been a stop-and-go process. Restructuring programs include\r\n  liquidating large energy-intensive industries and major agricultural\r\n  and financial sector reforms. Today, Romania is continuing its\r\n  difficult transition to a market-based economy. GDP contracted by an\r\n  estimated 7.3% in 1998 after a 6.6% decline in 1997. Tight monetary\r\n  policy and slower exchange rate depreciation earlier in 1998 helped\r\n  lower inflation to an estimated 41% from 152% in 1997. The large\r\n  current account deficit and concerns about meeting debt payments in\r\n  1999 contributed to increased pressure on the exchange rate towards\r\n  the end of 1998. Replacing the IMF standby agreement (suspended\r\n  because of lack of progress on structural reforms), servicing large\r\n  debt payments, and bringing the budget under control are key\r\n  priorities for 1999.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$90.6 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: -7.3% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$4,050 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 19%\r\n  industry: 41%\r\n  services: 40% (1997)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: 21.5% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 3.8%\r\n  highest 10%: 20.2% (1992)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 41% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 10.1 million (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: NA%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 9% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $10 billion\r\n  expenditures: $11.7 billion, including capital expenditures of $1.3\r\n  billion (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: mining, timber, construction materials, metallurgy,\r\n  chemicals, machine building, food processing, petroleum production\r\n  and refining\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: -17% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 59.245 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 72.11%\r\n  hydro: 26.35%\r\n  nuclear: 1.54%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 60.045 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 800 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: wheat, corn, sugar beets, sunflower seed,\r\n  potatoes, grapes;

czarist reigns of terror; massive\r\n  invasions by Swedes, French, and Germans; and the deadly communist\r\n  period (1917-91) in which Russia dominated an immense Soviet Union.\r\n  General Secretary Mikhail GORBACHEV, in charge during 1985-91,\r\n  introduced glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring) in an\r\n  attempt to modernize communism, but also inadvertently released\r\n  forces that shattered the USSR into 15 independent republics in\r\n  December 1991. Russia has struggled in its efforts to build a\r\n  democratic political system and market economy to replace the strict\r\n  social, political, and economic controls of the communist period.\r\n  These reform efforts have resulted in contradictory and confusing\r\n  economic and political regulations and practices. Industry,\r\n  agriculture, the military, the central government, and the ruble\r\n  have suffered, but Russia has successfully held one presidential,\r\n  two legislative, and numerous regional elections since 1991. The\r\n  severe illnesses of President Boris YEL'TSIN have contributed to a\r\n  lack of policy focus at the center.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeography\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: Northern Asia (that part west of the Urals is sometimes\r\n  included with Europe), bordering the Arctic Ocean, between Europe\r\n  and the North Pacific Ocean\r\n\r\nGeographic coordinates: 60 00 N, 100 00 E\r\n\r\nMap references: Asia\r\n\r\nArea:\r\n  total: 17,075,200 sq km\r\n  land: 16,995,800 sq km\r\n  water: 79,400 sq km\r\n\r\nArea--comparative: slightly less than 1.8 times the size of the US\r\n\r\nLand boundaries:\r\n  total: 19,917 km\r\n  border countries: Azerbaijan 284 km, Belarus 959 km, China\r\n  (southeast) 3,605 km, China (south) 40 km, Estonia 294 km, Finland\r\n  1,313 km, Georgia 723 km, Kazakhstan 6,846 km, North Korea 19 km,\r\n  Latvia 217 km, Lithuania (Kaliningrad Oblast) 227 km, Mongolia 3,441\r\n  km, Norway 167 km, Poland (Kaliningrad Oblast) 206 km, Ukraine 1,576\r\n  km\r\n\r\nCoastline: 37,653 km\r\n\r\nMaritime claims:\r\n  continental shelf: 200-m depth or to the depth of exploitation\r\n  exclusive economic zone: 200 nm\r\n  territorial sea: 12 nm\r\n\r\nClimate: ranges from steppes in the south through humid\r\n  continental in much of European Russia;

Russian GDP has contracted an\r\n  estimated 43% since 1991, including a 5% drop in 1998, despite the\r\n  country's wealth of natural resources, its well-educated population,\r\n  and its diverse--although increasingly dilapidated--industrial base.\r\n  By the end of 1997, Russia had achieved some progress. Inflation had\r\n  been brought under control, the ruble was stabilized, and an\r\n  ambitious privatization program had transferred thousands of\r\n  enterprises to private ownership. Some important market-oriented\r\n  laws were also passed, including a commercial code governing\r\n  business relations and an arbitration court for resolving economic\r\n  disputes. But in 1998, the Asian financial crisis swept through the\r\n  country, contributing to a sharp decline in russia's earnings from\r\n  oil exports and resulting in an exodus of foreign investors. Matters\r\n  came to a head in August 1998 when the government allowed the ruble\r\n  to fall precipitously and stopped payment on $40 billion in ruble\r\n  bonds. Ongoing problems include an undeveloped legal and financial\r\n  system, poor progress on restructuring the military-industrial\r\n  complex, and persistently large budget deficits, largely reflecting\r\n  the inability of successive governments to collect sufficient taxes.\r\n  Russia's transition to a market economy has also been slowed by the\r\n  growing prevalence of payment arrears and barter and by widespread\r\n  corruption. The severity of Russia's economic problems is dramatized\r\n  by the large annual decline in population, estimated by some\r\n  observers at 800,000 people, caused by environmental hazards, the\r\n  decline in health care, and the unwillingness of people to have\r\n  children.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$593.4 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: -5% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$4,000 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 7%\r\n  industry: 39%\r\n  services: 54% (1997)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: 28.6% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 3%\r\n  highest 10%: 22.2% (1993)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 84% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 66 million (1997)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: NA\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 11.5% (1998 est.) with considerable additional\r\n  underemployment\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $40 billion\r\n  expenditures: $63 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: complete range of mining and extractive industries\r\n  producing coal, oil, gas, chemicals, and metals; all forms of\r\n  machine building from rolling mills to high-performance aircraft and\r\n  space vehicles; shipbuilding; road and rail transportation\r\n  equipment; communications equipment; agricultural machinery,\r\n  tractors, and construction equipment; electric power generating and\r\n  transmitting equipment; medical and scientific instruments; consumer\r\n  durables, textiles, foodstuffs, handicrafts\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: -5.5% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 834 billion kWh (1997)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 68.14%\r\n  hydro: 19%\r\n  nuclear: 12.82%\r\n  other: 0.04% (1997)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 788.036 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 24.2 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 6.6 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: grain, sugar beets, sunflower seed,\r\n  vegetables, fruits; beef, milk\r\n\r\nExports: $71.8 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nExports--commodities: petroleum and petroleum products, natural\r\n  gas, wood and wood products, metals, chemicals, and a wide variety\r\n  of civilian and military manufactures\r\n\r\nExports--partners: Ukraine, Germany, US, Belarus, other Western\r\n  and less developed countries\r\n\r\nImports: $58.5 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nImports--commodities: machinery and equipment, consumer goods,\r\n  medicines, meat, grain, sugar, semifinished metal products\r\n\r\nImports--partners: Europe, North America, Japan, and less\r\n  developed countries\r\n\r\nDebt--external: $164 billion (yearend 1998)\r\n\r\nEconomic aid--recipient: $8.523 billion (1995)\r\n\r\nCurrency: 1 ruble (R) = 100 kopeks\r\n\r\nExchange rates: rubles per US$1--22.2876 (January 1999), 9.7051\r\n  (1998), 5,785 (1997), 5,121 (1996), 4,559 (1995), 2,191 (1994)\r\n  note: the post-1 January 1998 ruble is equal to 1,000 of the pre-1\r\n  January 1998 rubles\r\n\r\nFiscal year: calendar year\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunications\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTelephones: 23.8 million (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nTelephone system: the telephone system has undergone significant\r\n  changes in the 1990's; there are more than 1,000 companies licensed\r\n  to offer communication services; access to digital lines has\r\n  improved, particularly in urban centers; Internet and e-mail\r\n  services are improving; Russia has made progress toward building the\r\n  telecommunications infrastructure necessary for a market economy\r\n  domestic: cross country digital trunk lines run from St. Petersburg\r\n  to Khabarovsk, and from Moscow to Novorossiysk; the telephone\r\n  systems in 60 regional capitals have modern digital infrastructures;\r\n  cellular services, both analog and digital, are available in many\r\n  areas; in rural areas, the telephone services are still outdated,\r\n  inadequate, and low density\r\n  international: Russia is connected internationally by three undersea\r\n  fiber-optic cables; digital switches in several cities provide more\r\n  than 50,000 lines for international calls; satellite earth stations\r\n  provide access to Intelsat, Intersputnik, Eutelsat, Inmarsat, and\r\n  Orbita\r\n\r\nRadio broadcast stations: AM NA, FM NA, shortwave NA; note--there\r\n  are about 1,050 (including AM, FM, and shortwave) radio broadcast\r\n  stations throughout the country\r\n\r\nRadios: 50 million (1993 est.)

In 1959, the majority ethnic group, the\r\n  Hutus, overthrew the ruling Tutsi monarch. The Hutus killed hundreds\r\n  of Tutsis and drove tens of thousands into exile in neighboring\r\n  countries. The children of these exiles later formed a rebel group,\r\n  the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), and began a civil war in October\r\n  1990. The war, along with several political and economic upheavals,\r\n  exasperated ethnic tensions culminating in April 1994 in a genocide\r\n  in which roughly 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed. The\r\n  Tutsi rebels defeated the Hutu regime and ended the genocide in July\r\n  1994, but approximately 2 million Hutu refugees--many fearing Tutsi\r\n  retribution--fled to neighboring Burundi, Tanzania, Uganda, and\r\n  Zaire, now called the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DROC).\r\n  According to the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees, in\r\n  1996 and early 1997 nearly 1.3 million Hutus returned to Rwanda.\r\n  Even with substantial international aid, these civil dislocations\r\n  have hindered efforts to foster reconciliation and to boost\r\n  investment and agricultural output. Although much of the country is\r\n  now at peace, members of the former regime continue to destabilize\r\n  the northwest area of the country through a low-intensity\r\n  insurgency. Rwandan troops are currently involved in a crisis\r\n  engulfing neighboring DROC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeography\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: Central Africa, east of Democratic Republic of the Congo\r\n\r\nGeographic coordinates: 2 00 S, 30 00 E\r\n\r\nMap references: Africa\r\n\r\nArea:\r\n  total: 26,340 sq km\r\n  land: 24,950 sq km\r\n  water: 1,390 sq km\r\n\r\nArea--comparative: slightly smaller than Maryland\r\n\r\nLand boundaries:\r\n  total: 893 km\r\n  border countries: Burundi 290 km, Democratic Republic of the Congo\r\n  217 km, Tanzania 217 km, Uganda 169 km\r\n\r\nCoastline: 0 km (landlocked)\r\n\r\nMaritime claims: none (landlocked)\r\n\r\nClimate: temperate;

It is the\r\n  most densely populated country in Africa; is landlocked, and has few\r\n  natural resources and minimal industry. Primary exports are coffee\r\n  and tea. The 1994 genocide decimated Rwanda's fragile economic base,\r\n  severely impoverished the population, particularly women, and eroded\r\n  the country's ability to attract private and external investment.\r\n  However, Rwanda has made significant progress in stabilizing and\r\n  rehabilitating its economy.

In 1997 some leaders in Nevis were urging\r\n  separation from Saint Kitts on the basis that Nevis was paying far\r\n  more in taxes than it was receiving in government services, but the\r\n  vote on cessation failed in August 1998.

Increased competition from Latin\r\n  American bananas will probably further reduce market prices,\r\n  exacerbating Saint Lucia's need to diversify its economy in coming\r\n  years, e.g., by further expanding tourism, manufacturing, and\r\n  construction. In 1997, strong activity in tourism and other service\r\n  sectors offset the contraction in agriculture, manufacturing, and\r\n  construction sectors. Improvement in the construction sector and\r\n  growth of the tourism industry was expected to expand GDP in 1998.\r\n  The agriculture sector registered its fifth year of decline in 1997\r\n  primarily because of a severe decline in banana production.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$625 million (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 2.2% (1997)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$4,100 (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 10.7%\r\n  industry: 32.3%\r\n  services: 57% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 1.9% (1997)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 43,800\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture 43.4%, services 38.9%,\r\n  industry and commerce 17.7% (1983 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 15% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $141.2 million\r\n  expenditures: $146.7 million, including capital expenditures of\r\n  $25.1 million (FY97/98 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: clothing, assembly of electronic components,\r\n  beverages, corrugated cardboard boxes, tourism, lime processing,\r\n  coconut processing\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: -8.9% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 110 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 100%\r\n  hydro: 0%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 110 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: bananas, coconuts, vegetables, citrus, root\r\n  crops, cocoa\r\n\r\nExports: $70.1 million (1997)\r\n\r\nExports--commodities: bananas 41%, clothing, cocoa, vegetables,\r\n  fruits, coconut oil\r\n\r\nExports--partners: UK 50%, US 24%, Caricom countries 16% (1995)\r\n\r\nImports: $292.4 million (1997)\r\n\r\nImports--commodities: food 23%, manufactured goods 21%, machinery\r\n  and transportation equipment 19%, chemicals, fuels\r\n\r\nImports--partners: US 36%, Caricom countries 22%, UK 11%, Japan\r\n  5%, Canada 4% (1995)\r\n\r\nDebt--external: $159 million (1997)\r\n\r\nEconomic aid--recipient: $51.8 million (1995)\r\n\r\nCurrency: 1 East Caribbean dollar (EC$) = 100 cents\r\n\r\nExchange rates: East Caribbean dollars (EC$) per US$1--2.7000\r\n  (fixed rate since 1976)\r\n\r\nFiscal year: 1 April--31 March\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunications\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTelephones: 26,000 (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nTelephone system:\r\n  domestic: system is automatically switched\r\n  international: direct microwave radio relay link with Martinique and\r\n  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines;

The economy has been declining, however,\r\n  because the number of ships stopping at Saint Pierre has dropped\r\n  steadily over the years. In 1992, an arbitration panel awarded the\r\n  islands an exclusive economic zone of 12,348 sq km to settle a\r\n  longstanding territorial dispute with Canada, although it represents\r\n  only 25% of what France had sought. The islands are heavily\r\n  subsidized by France. Imports come primarily from Canada and France.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$74 million (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$11,000 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NA%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): NA%\r\n\r\nLabor force: 3,000 (1996)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: NA\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 9.8% (1997)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $70 million\r\n  expenditures: $60 million, including capital expenditures of $24\r\n  million (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: fish processing and supply base for fishing fleets;\r\n  tourism\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 39 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 100%\r\n  hydro: 0%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 39 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: vegetables;

The\r\n  services sector, based mostly on a growing tourist industry, is also\r\n  important. The government has been relatively unsuccessful at\r\n  introducing new industries, and high unemployment rates of 35%-40%\r\n  continue. The continuing dependence on a single crop represents the\r\n  biggest obstacle to the islands' development; tropical storms wiped\r\n  out substantial portions of crops in both 1994 and 1995. The tourism\r\n  sector has considerable potential for development over the next\r\n  decade. Recent growth has been stimulated by strong activity in the\r\n  construction sector and an improvement in tourism.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$289 million (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 4% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$2,400 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 10.6%\r\n  industry: 17.5%\r\n  services: 71.9% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 3.6% (1996)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 67,000 (1984 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture 26%, industry 17%,\r\n  services 57% (1980 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 35%-40% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $85.7 million\r\n  expenditures: $98.6 million, including capital expenditures of $25.7\r\n  million (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: food processing, cement, furniture, clothing, starch\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: -0.9% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 62 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 67.74%\r\n  hydro: 32.26%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 62 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: bananas, coconuts, sweet potatoes, spices;\r\n  small numbers of cattle, sheep, pigs, goats;

The country is vulnerable to\r\n  devastating storms. Agriculture employs two-thirds of the labor\r\n  force, and furnishes 90% of exports, featuring coconut cream,\r\n  coconut oil, and copra. Outside of a large automotive wire harness\r\n  factory, the manufacturing sector mainly processes agricultural\r\n  products. Tourism is an expanding sector; more than 70,0000 tourists\r\n  visited the islands in 1996. The Samoan Government has called for\r\n  deregulation of the financial sector, encouragement of investment,\r\n  and continued fiscal discipline. Observers point to the flexibility\r\n  of the labor market as a basic strength for future economic advances.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$470 million (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 3.4% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$2,100 (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 40%\r\n  industry: 25%\r\n  services: 35% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 2.2% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 82,500 (1991 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture 65%, services 30%,\r\n  industry 5% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $52 million\r\n  expenditures: $99 million, including capital expenditures of $37\r\n  million (FY96/97 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: timber, tourism, food processing, fishing\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 14% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 65 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 61.54%\r\n  hydro: 38.46%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 65 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: coconuts, bananas, taro, yams\r\n\r\nExports: $14.6 million (f.o.b., 1997)\r\n\r\nExports--commodities: coconut oil and cream, copra, fish, beer\r\n\r\nExports--partners: Australia 82%, New Zealand 6%, Slovakia,\r\n  Germany, American Samoa (1996)\r\n\r\nImports: $99.7 million (f.o.b., 1997)\r\n\r\nImports--commodities: intermediate goods, food, capital goods\r\n\r\nImports--partners: Australia 33%, New Zealand 25%, Japan 15%, Fiji\r\n  8%, US 8% (1996)\r\n\r\nDebt--external: $167 million (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nEconomic aid--recipient: $42.9 million (1995)\r\n\r\nCurrency: 1 tala (WS$) = 100 sene\r\n\r\nExchange rates: tala (WS$) per US$1--2.9011 (January 1999), 2.9429\r\n  (1998), 2.5562 (1997), 2.4618 (1996), 2.4722 (1995), 2.5349 (1994)\r\n\r\nFiscal year: calendar year\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunications\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTelephones: 7,500 (1988 est.)\r\n\r\nTelephone system:\r\n  domestic: NA\r\n  international: satellite earth station--1 Intelsat (Pacific Ocean)\r\n\r\nRadio broadcast stations: AM 1, FM 0, shortwave 0\r\n\r\nRadios: 76,000 (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nTelevision broadcast stations: 6 (1997)\r\n\r\nTelevisions: 6,000 (1992 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTransportation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRailways: 0 km\r\n\r\nHighways:\r\n  total: 790 km\r\n  paved: 332 km\r\n  unpaved: 458 km (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nPorts and harbors: Apia, Asau, Mulifanua, Salelologa\r\n\r\nAirports: 3 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nAirports--with paved runways:\r\n  total: 1\r\n  2,438 to 3,047 m: 1 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nAirports--with unpaved runways:\r\n  total: 2\r\n  under 914 m: 2 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMilitary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMilitary branches: no regular armed services;

However, cocoa production has substantially declined because of\r\n  drought and mismanagement. The resulting shortage of cocoa for\r\n  export has created a persistent balance-of-payments problem. Sao\r\n  Tome has to import all fuels, most manufactured goods, consumer\r\n  goods, and a significant amount of food. Over the years, it has been\r\n  unable to service its external debt and has had to depend on\r\n  concessional aid and debt rescheduling. Considerable potential\r\n  exists for development of a tourist industry, and the government has\r\n  taken steps to expand facilities in recent years. The government\r\n  also has attempted to reduce price controls and subsidies, but\r\n  economic growth has remained sluggish. Sao Tome is also optimistic\r\n  that significant petroleum discoveries are forthcoming in its\r\n  territorial waters in the oil-rich waters of the Gulf of Guinea.\r\n  Corruption scandals continue to weaken the economy.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$164 million (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 2.5% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$1,100 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 23%\r\n  industry: 19%\r\n  services: 58% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 21% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: NA\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: population mainly engaged in\r\n  subsistence agriculture and fishing\r\n  note: there are shortages of skilled workers\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 50% in the formal business sector (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $58 million\r\n  expenditures: $114 million, including capital expenditures of $54\r\n  million (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: light construction, textiles, soap, beer;

Saudi\r\n  Arabia has the largest reserves of petroleum in the world (26% of\r\n  the proved total), ranks as the largest exporter of petroleum, and\r\n  plays a leading role in OPEC. The petroleum sector accounts for\r\n  roughly 75% of budget revenues, 40% of GDP, and 90% of export\r\n  earnings. About 35% of GDP comes from the private sector. Roughly 4\r\n  million foreign workers play an important role in the Saudi economy,\r\n  for example, in the oil and service sectors. The Saudi economy was\r\n  severely hit by the large decline in world oil prices in 1998. GDP\r\n  fell by nearly 11%; the budget deficit rose to $12.3 billion; and\r\n  the current account recorded a $13 billion deficit--the first in\r\n  three years. The government announced plans to implement large\r\n  spending cuts in 1999 because of weak oil prices and will continue\r\n  to call on greater private sector involvement in the economy.\r\n  Shortages of water and rapid population growth will constrain\r\n  government efforts to increase self-sufficiency in agricultural\r\n  products.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$186 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: -10.8% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$9,000 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 6%\r\n  industry: 53%\r\n  services: 41% (1996)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): -0.2% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 7 million\r\n  note: 35% of the population in the 15-64 age group is non-national\r\n  (July 1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: government 40%, industry,\r\n  construction, and oil 25%, services 30%, agriculture 5%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $32.3 billion\r\n  expenditures: $44 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1999 budget est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: crude oil production, petroleum refining, basic\r\n  petrochemicals, cement, two small steel-rolling mills, construction,\r\n  fertilizer, plastics\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 1% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 95 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 100%\r\n  hydro: 0%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 95 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: wheat, barley, tomatoes, melons, dates,\r\n  citrus;

This reform began with a 50%\r\n  devaluation of Senegal's currency, the CFA franc, which is linked at\r\n  a fixed rate to the French franc. Government price controls and\r\n  subsidies have been steadily dismantled. After seeing its economy\r\n  contract by 2.1% in 1993, Senegal made an important turnaround,\r\n  thanks to the reform program, with real growth in GDP averaging 5%\r\n  annually in 1995-98. Annual inflation has been pushed below 2%, and\r\n  the fiscal deficit has been cut to less than 1.5% of GDP. Investment\r\n  rose steadily from 13.8% of GDP in 1993 to 16.5% in 1997. As a\r\n  member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA),\r\n  Senegal is working toward greater regional integration with a\r\n  unified external tariff. Senegal also realized full Internet\r\n  connectivity in 1996, creating a miniboom in information\r\n  technology-based services. Private activity now accounts for 82% of\r\n  GDP. On the negative side, Senegal faces deep-seated urban problems\r\n  of chronic unemployment, juvenile delinquency, and drug addiction.\r\n  Forecasters predict growth will continue in the 5% range in\r\n  1999-2000.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$15.6 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 5.7% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$1,600 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 19%\r\n  industry: 17%\r\n  services: 64% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 1.4%\r\n  highest 10%: 42.8% (1991)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 1.8% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: NA\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture 60%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%;

Output in Serbia and Montenegro dropped\r\n  by half in 1992-93. Like the other former Yugoslav republics, it had\r\n  depended on its sister republics for large amounts of energy and\r\n  manufactures. Wide differences in climate, mineral resources, and\r\n  levels of technology among the republics accentuated this\r\n  interdependence, as did the communist practice of concentrating much\r\n  industrial output in a small number of giant plants. The breakup of\r\n  many of the trade links, the sharp drop in output as industrial\r\n  plants lost suppliers and markets, and the destruction of physical\r\n  assets in the fighting all have contributed to the economic\r\n  difficulties of the republics. One singular factor in the economic\r\n  situation of Serbia is the continuation in office of a government\r\n  that is primarily interested in political and military mastery, not\r\n  economic reform. Hyperinflation ended with the establishment of a\r\n  new currency unit in June 1993; prices were relatively stable from\r\n  1995 through 1997, but inflationary pressures resurged in 1998.\r\n  Reliable statistics continue to be hard to come by, and the GDP\r\n  estimate is extremely rough. The economic boom anticipated by the\r\n  government after the suspension of UN sanctions in December 1995 has\r\n  failed to materialize. Government mismanagement of the economy is\r\n  largely to blame. Also, the Outer Wall sanctions that exclude\r\n  Belgrade from international financial institutions and an investment\r\n  ban and asset freeze imposed in 1998 because of Belgrade's\r\n  repressive actions in Kosovo have added to economic difficulties.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$25.4 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 3.5% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$2,300 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 25%\r\n  industry: 50%\r\n  services: 25% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 48% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: NA\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: industry 41%, services 35%, trade and\r\n  tourism 12%, transportation and communication 7%, agriculture 5%\r\n  (1994)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: more than 35% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $NA\r\n  expenditures: $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n\r\nIndustries: machine building (aircraft, trucks, and automobiles;\r\n  tanks and weapons;

Growth has been led by the tourist\r\n  sector, which employs about 30% of the labor force and provides more\r\n  than 70% of hard currency earnings, and by tuna fishing, which\r\n  accounted for 70% of GDP in 1996-97. In recent years the government\r\n  has encouraged foreign investment in order to upgrade hotels and\r\n  other services. At the same time, the government has moved to reduce\r\n  the dependence on tourism by promoting the development of farming,\r\n  fishing, and small-scale manufacturing. The vulnerability of the\r\n  tourist sector was illustrated by the sharp drop in 1991-92 due\r\n  largely to the Gulf war. Although the industry has rebounded, the\r\n  government recognizes the continuing need for upgrading the sector\r\n  in the face of stiff international competition. Other issues facing\r\n  the government are the curbing of the budget deficit and further\r\n  privatization of public enterprises.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$550 million (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 4.3% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$7,000 (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 4%\r\n  industry: 15%\r\n  services: 81% (1994)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 0.6% (1997)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 26,000 (1996)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: industry 19%, services 57%, government\r\n  14%, fishing, agriculture, and forestry 10% (1989)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $220 million\r\n  expenditures: $241 million, including capital expenditures of $36\r\n  million (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: fishing; tourism; processing of coconuts and vanilla,\r\n  coir (coconut fiber) rope, boat building, printing, furniture;\r\n  beverages\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 4% (1992)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 125 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 100%\r\n  hydro: 0%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 125 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: coconuts, cinnamon, vanilla, sweet\r\n  potatoes, cassava (tapioca), bananas; broiler chickens; tuna fish\r\n\r\nExports: $53 million ( f.o.b., 1995)\r\n\r\nExports--commodities: fish, cinnamon bark, copra, petroleum\r\n  products (reexports)\r\n\r\nExports--partners: France, UK, China, Germany, Japan (1993)\r\n\r\nImports: $340 million (c.i.f., 1997)\r\n\r\nImports--commodities: manufactured goods, food, petroleum\r\n  products, tobacco, beverages, machinery and transportation equipment\r\n\r\nImports--partners: China, Singapore, South Africa, UK (1993)\r\n\r\nDebt--external: $170 million (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nEconomic aid--recipient: $16.4 million (1995)\r\n\r\nCurrency: 1 Seychelles rupee (SRe) = 100 cents\r\n\r\nExchange rates: Seychelles rupees (SRe) per US$1--5.4540 (January\r\n  1999), 5.2622 (1998), 5.0263 (1997), 4.9700 (1996), 4.7620 (1995),\r\n  5.0559 (1994)\r\n\r\nFiscal year: calendar year\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunications\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTelephones: 13,000 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nTelephone system:\r\n  domestic: radiotelephone communications between islands in the\r\n  archipelago\r\n  international: direct radiotelephone communications with adjacent\r\n  island countries and African coastal countries; satellite earth\r\n  station--1 Intelsat (Indian Ocean)\r\n\r\nRadio broadcast stations: AM 3, FM 0, shortwave 0\r\n\r\nRadios: 50,000 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nTelevision broadcast stations: 2 (in addition, there are 9\r\n  repeaters) (1997)\r\n\r\nTelevisions: 12,000 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTransportation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRailways: 0 km\r\n\r\nHighways:\r\n  total: 280 km\r\n  paved: 176 km\r\n  unpaved: 104 km (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nPorts and harbors: Victoria\r\n\r\nMerchant marine: none\r\n\r\nAirports: 14 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nAirports--with paved runways:\r\n  total: 6\r\n  2,438 to 3,047 m: 1\r\n  914 to 1,523 m: 3\r\n  under 914 m: 2 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nAirports--with unpaved runways:\r\n  total: 8\r\n  914 to 1,523 m: 4\r\n  under 914 m: 4 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMilitary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMilitary branches: Army, Coast Guard, Marines, air wing, National\r\n  Guard, Presidential Protection Unit, Police Force\r\n\r\nMilitary manpower--availability:\r\n  males age 15-49: 22,420 (1999 est.)\r\n\r\nMilitary manpower--fit for military service:\r\n  males age 15-49: 11,242 (1999 est.)\r\n\r\nMilitary expenditures--dollar figure: $13.7 million (1995)\r\n\r\nMilitary expenditures--percent of GDP: NA%\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTransnational Issues\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDisputes--international: claims Chagos Archipelago in British\r\n  Indian Ocean Territory\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n======================================================================\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n@Sierra Leone\r\n------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBackground: On 25 May 1997, the democratically-elected government\r\n  of President Ahmad Tejan KABBAH was overthrown by a disgruntled\r\n  coalition of army personnel from the Armed Forces Revolutionary\r\n  Council (AFRC) and the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) under the\r\n  command of Major Johnny Paul KOROMA; President KABBAH fled to exile\r\n  in Guinea. The Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire\r\n  Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) forces, led by a strong Nigerian\r\n  contingent, undertook the suppression of the rebellion. They were\r\n  initially unsuccessful, but, by October 1997, they forced the rebels\r\n  to agree to a cease-fire and to a plan to return the government to\r\n  democratic control. President KABBAH returned to office on 10 March\r\n  1998 to face the task of restoring order to a demoralized population\r\n  and a disorganized and severely damaged economy. Many of the leaders\r\n  of the coup were tried and executed in October 1998. In January\r\n  1999, the situation had deteriorated even further, with commerce at\r\n  a standstill, hundreds of thousands of people driven from their\r\n  homes, and bitter fighting between the AFRC/RUF and ECOMOG troops\r\n  intensifying by large-scale import of arms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeography\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: Western Africa, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean,\r\n  between Guinea and Liberia\r\n\r\nGeographic coordinates: 8 30 N, 11 30 W\r\n\r\nMap references: Africa\r\n\r\nArea:\r\n  total: 71,740 sq km\r\n  land: 71,620 sq km\r\n  water: 120 sq km\r\n\r\nArea--comparative: slightly smaller than South Carolina\r\n\r\nLand boundaries:\r\n  total: 958 km\r\n  border countries: Guinea 652 km, Liberia 306 km\r\n\r\nCoastline: 402 km\r\n\r\nMaritime claims:\r\n  territorial sea: 200 nm\r\n  continental shelf: 200-m depth or to the depth of exploitation\r\n\r\nClimate: tropical;

However, the economic and\r\n  social infrastructure is not well developed, and serious social\r\n  disorders continue to hamper economic development. The period of\r\n  AFRC/RUF junta rule (May 1997-February 1998) led to UN sanctions and\r\n  20% drop in GDP in 1997. The continued fighting at yearend 1997 set\r\n  back what small progress had been made by the KABBAH government in\r\n  recovering from the junta period and reestablishing a viable\r\n  economy. About two-thirds of the working-age population engages in\r\n  subsistence agriculture. Manufacturing consists mainly of the\r\n  processing of raw materials and of light manufacturing for the\r\n  domestic market. Bauxite and rutile mines have been shut down by\r\n  civil strife. The major source of hard currency is found in the\r\n  mining of diamonds, the large majority of which are smuggled out of\r\n  the country. The fate of the economy in 1999 depends on the outcome\r\n  of negotiations to end the civil strife.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$2.7 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 0.7% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$530 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 52%\r\n  industry: 16%\r\n  services: 32% (1996)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: 68% (1989 est.)\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 0.5%\r\n  highest 10%: 43.6% (1989)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 37.4% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 1.369 million (1981 est.)\r\n  note: only about 65,000 wage earners (1985)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture 65%, industry 19%,\r\n  services 16% (1981 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $96 million\r\n  expenditures: $150 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: mining (diamonds);

Extraordinarily\r\n  strong fundamentals allowed Singapore to weather the effects of the\r\n  Asian financial crisis better than its neighbors, but the crisis did\r\n  pull GDP growth down to 1.3% in 1998 from 6% in 1997. Projections\r\n  for 1999 GDP growth are in the -1% to 1% range. Rising labor costs\r\n  and appreciation of the Singapore dollar against its neighbors'\r\n  currencies continue to be a threat to Singapore's competitiveness.\r\n  The government's strategy to address this problem includes cutting\r\n  costs, increasing productivity, improving infrastructure, and\r\n  encouraging higher value-added industries. In applied technology,\r\n  per capita output, investment, and labor discipline, Singapore has\r\n  key attributes of a developed country.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$91.7 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 1.3% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$26,300 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NEGL%\r\n  industry: 28%\r\n  services: 72%\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): -0.5% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 1.856 million (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: financial, business, and other\r\n  services 33.5%, manufacturing 25.6%, commerce 22.9%, construction\r\n  6.6%, other 11.4% (1994)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 5% (1999 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $16.3 billion\r\n  expenditures: $13.6 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (FY97/98 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: electronics, financial services, oil drilling\r\n  equipment, petroleum refining, rubber processing and rubber\r\n  products, processed food and beverages, ship repair, entrepot trade,\r\n  biotechnology\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 3% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 28 billion kWh (1998)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 100%\r\n  hydro: 0%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 28 billion kWh (1998)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1998)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1998)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: rubber, copra, fruit, vegetables;

International credit rating\r\n  agencies have downgraded Slovak debt to below investment grade. The\r\n  new government intends to address the economy's ills by giving\r\n  priority to joining the OECD and EU, cutting government wage and\r\n  infrastructure spending, boosting some taxes and regulated prices,\r\n  expanding privatization to companies formerly considered strategic,\r\n  restructuring the financial section, encouraging foreign investment,\r\n  and reenergizing the social partnership with labor and employers.\r\n  Government officials believe as long as two years may be needed\r\n  before its structural reforms improve economic performance. In 1999,\r\n  the government expects GDP growth to slow from 5% in 1998 to 2%,\r\n  inflation to rise from 6% to 10%, and unemployment to rise from less\r\n  than 14% to 15% or 16%, but hopes to bring the budget deficit down\r\n  to no more than 2% of GDP and the current account deficit down to 5%\r\n  to 6% of GDP.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$44.5 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 5% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$8,300 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 4.8%\r\n  industry: 33.4%\r\n  services: 61.8% (1997)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 5.1%\r\n  highest 10%: 18.2% (1992)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 7.4% (1998)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 3.32 million (1997)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: industry 29.3%, agriculture 8.9%,\r\n  construction 8%, transport and communication 8.2%, services 45.6%\r\n  (1994)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 14% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $5.4 billion\r\n  expenditures: $6.5 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1997)\r\n\r\nIndustries: metal and metal products;

Following the war, internal\r\n  self-government was established in 1976, and independence from the\r\n  UK came two years later. Current issues include government deficits,\r\n  deforestation, and malaria control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeography\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: Oceania, group of islands in the South Pacific Ocean,\r\n  east of Papua New Guinea\r\n\r\nGeographic coordinates: 8 00 S, 159 00 E\r\n\r\nMap references: Oceania\r\n\r\nArea:\r\n  total: 28,450 sq km\r\n  land: 27,540 sq km\r\n  water: 910 sq km\r\n\r\nArea--comparative: slightly smaller than Maryland\r\n\r\nLand boundaries: 0 km\r\n\r\nCoastline: 5,313 km\r\n\r\nMaritime claims: measured from claimed archipelagic baselines\r\n  continental shelf: 200 nm\r\n  exclusive economic zone: 200 nm\r\n  territorial sea: 12 nm\r\n\r\nClimate: tropical monsoon;

The economy has been growing\r\n  and in February 1996 the EU agreed to finance the reconstruction of\r\n  the port of Berbera; since then, other aid projects have been\r\n  assumed by the EU and by a non-governmental Italian organization.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEconomy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEconomy--overview: One of the world's poorest and least developed\r\n  countries, Somalia has few resources. Moreover, much of the economy\r\n  has been devastated by the civil war. Agriculture is the most\r\n  important sector, with livestock accounting for about 40% of GDP and\r\n  about 65% of export earnings. Nomads and semi-nomads, who are\r\n  dependent upon livestock for their livelihood, make up a large\r\n  portion of the population. After livestock, bananas are the\r\n  principal export; sugar, sorghum, corn, and fish are products for\r\n  the domestic market. The small industrial sector, based on the\r\n  processing of agricultural products, accounts for 10% of GDP; most\r\n  facilities have been shut down because of the civil strife.\r\n  Moreover, as of early 1999, ongoing civil disturbances in Mogadishu\r\n  and outlying areas are interfering with any substantial economic\r\n  advance.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$4 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$600 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 59%\r\n  industry: 10%\r\n  services: 31% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): NA%\r\n\r\nLabor force: 3.7 million (very few are skilled laborers)(1993\r\n  est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture (mostly pastoral nomadism)\r\n  71%, industry and services 29%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $NA\r\n  expenditures: $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n\r\nIndustries: a few small industries, including sugar refining,\r\n  textiles, petroleum refining (mostly shut down)\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 258 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 100%\r\n  hydro: 0%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 258 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: bananas, sorghum, corn, sugarcane, mangoes,\r\n  sesame seeds, beans; cattle, sheep, goats; fish\r\n\r\nExports: $123 million (f.o.b., 1995 est.)\r\n\r\nExports--commodities: livestock, bananas, hides, fish (1997)\r\n\r\nExports--partners: Saudi Arabia 55%, Yemen 19%, Italy 11%, UAE, US\r\n  (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nImports: $60 million (f.o.b., 1995 est.)\r\n\r\nImports--commodities: manufactures, petroleum products,\r\n  foodstuffs, construction materials (1995)\r\n\r\nImports--partners: Kenya 28%, Djibouti 21%, Brazil 6%, Pakistan\r\n  (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nDebt--external: $2.6 billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nEconomic aid--recipient: $191.5 million (1995)\r\n\r\nCurrency: 1 Somali shilling (So.

However, growth has\r\n  not been strong enough to cut into the 30% unemployment, and\r\n  daunting economic problems remain from the apartheid era, especially\r\n  the problems of poverty and lack of economic empowerment among the\r\n  disadvantaged groups. Other problems are crime and corruption. The\r\n  new government demonstrated its commitment to open markets,\r\n  privatization, and a favorable investment climate with the release\r\n  of its macroeconomic strategy in June 1996. Called \"Growth,\r\n  Employment and Redistribution,\" this policy framework includes the\r\n  introduction of tax incentives to stimulate new investment in\r\n  labor-intensive projects, expansion of basic infrastructure\r\n  services, the restructuring and partial privatization of state\r\n  assets, continued reduction of tariffs, subsidies to promote\r\n  economic efficiency, improved services to the disadvantaged, and\r\n  integration into the global economy. Serious structural rigidities\r\n  remain, including a complicated and relatively protectionist trade\r\n  regime, and concentration of wealth and economic control.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$290.6 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 0.3% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$6,800 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 5%\r\n  industry: 39%\r\n  services: 56% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 1.4%\r\n  highest 10%: 47.3% (1993)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 9% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 15 million economically active (1997)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: services 35%, agriculture 30%,\r\n  industry 20%, mining 9%, other 6%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 30% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $30.5 billion\r\n  expenditures: $38 billion, including capital expenditures of $2.6\r\n  billion (FY94/95 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: mining (world's largest producer of platinum, gold,\r\n  chromium), automobile assembly, metalworking, machinery, textile,\r\n  iron and steel, chemical, fertilizer, foodstuffs\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: -1% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 186.949 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 93%\r\n  hydro: 0.7%\r\n  nuclear: 6.3%\r\n  other: NA% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 181.404 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 5.575 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 30 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: corn, wheat, sugarcane, fruits, vegetables;\r\n  beef, poultry, mutton, wool, dairy products\r\n\r\nExports: $28.7 billion (f.o.b., 1998)\r\n\r\nExports--commodities: gold 20%, other minerals and metals 20%-25%,\r\n  food 5%, chemicals 3% (1997)\r\n\r\nExports--partners: UK, Italy, Japan, US, Germany (1997)\r\n\r\nImports: $27.2 billion (f.o.b., 1998)\r\n\r\nImports--commodities: machinery, transport equipment, chemicals,\r\n  petroleum products, textiles, scientific instruments (1997)\r\n\r\nImports--partners: Germany, US, UK, Japan (1997)\r\n\r\nDebt--external: $23.5 billion (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nEconomic aid--recipient: $676.3 million\r\n\r\nCurrency: 1 rand (R) = 100 cents\r\n\r\nExchange rates: rand (R) per US$1--5.98380 (January 1999), 5.52828\r\n  (1998), 4.60796 (1997), 4.29935 (1996), 3.62709 (1995), 3.55080\r\n  (1994)\r\n\r\nFiscal year: 1 April--31 March\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunications\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTelephones: 4.2 million (1997)\r\n\r\nTelephone system: the system is the best developed, most modern,\r\n  and has the highest capacity in Africa\r\n  domestic: consists of carrier-equipped open-wire lines, coaxial\r\n  cables, microwave radio relay links, fiber-optic cable, and\r\n  radiotelephone communication stations;

Its center-right government successfully\r\n  worked to gain admission to the first group of countries launching\r\n  the European single currency on 1 January 1999. The deficit-to-GDP\r\n  ratio is 2.1%, the debt-to-GDP ratio is around 68%, and inflation is\r\n  approximately 2%. Moreover, the AZNAR administration has continued\r\n  to advocate liberalization, privatization, and deregulation of the\r\n  economy and has introduced some tax reforms to that end.\r\n  Unemployment, nonetheless, remains the highest in the EU at 20%. The\r\n  government, for political reasons, has made only limited progress in\r\n  changing labor laws or reforming pension schemes, which are key to\r\n  the sustainability of both Spain's internal economic advances and\r\n  its competitiveness in a single currency area. Adjustment to the\r\n  monetary and other economic policies of an integrated Europe will\r\n  pose difficult challenges to Spain in the next few years.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$645.6 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 3.5% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$16,500 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 3.4%\r\n  industry: 33.3%\r\n  services: 63.3% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 2.8%\r\n  highest 10%: 25.2% (1990)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 2% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 16.2 million\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: services 64%, manufacturing, mining,\r\n  and construction 28%, agriculture 8% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 20% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $113 billion\r\n  expenditures: $139 billion, including capital expenditures of $15\r\n  billion (1995)\r\n\r\nIndustries: textiles and apparel (including footwear), food and\r\n  beverages, metals and metal manufactures, chemicals, shipbuilding,\r\n  automobiles, machine tools, tourism\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 5.8% (1998)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 163.468 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 43.17%\r\n  hydro: 23.92%\r\n  nuclear: 32.74%\r\n  other: 0.17% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 164.568 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 5.7 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 6.8 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: grain, vegetables, olives, wine grapes,\r\n  sugar beets, citrus;

Sri Lanka's most\r\n  dynamic industries now are food processing, textiles and apparel,\r\n  food and beverages, telecommunications, and insurance and banking.\r\n  By 1996 plantation crops made up only 20% of exports (compared with\r\n  93% in 1970), while textiles and garments accounted for 63%. GDP\r\n  grew at an annual average rate of 5.5% throughout the 1990s until a\r\n  drought and a deteriorating security situation lowered growth to\r\n  3.8% in 1996. The economy rebounded in 1997-98 with growth of 6.4%\r\n  and 4.7%. For the next round of reforms, the central bank of Sri\r\n  Lanka recommends that Colombo expand market mechanisms in\r\n  nonplantation agriculture, dismantle the government's monopoly on\r\n  wheat imports, and promote more competition in the financial sector.\r\n  A continuing cloud over the economy is the fighting between the\r\n  Sinhalese and the minority Tamils, which has cost 50,000 lives in\r\n  the past 15 years. The global slowdown will temper growth in 1999.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$48.1 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 4.7% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$2,500 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 18%\r\n  industry: 31%\r\n  services: 51% (1997)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: 35.3% (1990-91 est.)\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 3.8%\r\n  highest 10%: 25.2% (1990)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 9.3% (1998)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 6.2 million (1997)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: services 46%, agriculture 37%,\r\n  industry 17% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 11% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $3 billion\r\n  expenditures: $4.2 billion, including capital expenditures of $1\r\n  billion (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: processing of rubber, tea, coconuts, and other\r\n  agricultural commodities;

Industry mainly processes\r\n  agricultural items. Sluggish economic performance over the past\r\n  decade, attributable largely to declining annual rainfall, has kept\r\n  per capita income at low levels. A large foreign debt and huge\r\n  arrears continue to cause difficulties. In 1990 the International\r\n  Monetary Fund took the unusual step of declaring Sudan\r\n  noncooperative because of its nonpayment of arrears to the Fund.\r\n  After Sudan backtracked on promised reforms in 1992-93, the IMF\r\n  threatened to expel Sudan from the Fund. To avoid expulsion,\r\n  Khartoum agreed to make payments on its arrears to the Fund,\r\n  liberalize exchange rates, and reduce subsidies, measures it has\r\n  partially implemented. The government's continued prosecution of the\r\n  civil war and its growing international isolation continued to\r\n  inhibit growth in the nonagricultural sectors of the economy during\r\n  1998. Hyperinflation has raised consumer prices above the reach of\r\n  most. In 1998, a top priority was to develop potentially lucrative\r\n  oilfields in southcentral Sudan; the government is working with\r\n  foreign partners to exploit the oil sector.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$31.2 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 6.1% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$930 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 33%\r\n  industry: 17%\r\n  services: 50% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 27% (mid-1997 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 11 million (1996 est.)\r\n  note: labor shortages for almost all categories of skilled\r\n  employment (1983 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture 80%, industry and commerce\r\n  10%, government 6%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 30% (FY92/93 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $482 million\r\n  expenditures: $1.5 billion, including capital expenditures of $30\r\n  million (1996)\r\n\r\nIndustries: cotton ginning, textiles, cement, edible oils, sugar,\r\n  soap distilling, shoes, petroleum refining\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 5% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 1.315 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 27.76%\r\n  hydro: 72.24%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 1.315 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: cotton, groundnuts (peanuts), sorghum,\r\n  millet, wheat, gum arabic, sesame;

After assuming power in the fall of 1996, the WIJDENBOSCH\r\n  government ended the structural adjustment program of the previous\r\n  government, claiming it was unfair to the poorer elements of\r\n  society. Tax revenues fell as old taxes lapsed and the government\r\n  failed to implement new tax alternatives. By the end of 1997, the\r\n  allocation of new Dutch development funds was frozen as Surinamese\r\n  Government relations with the Netherlands deteriorated.

Manufacturing\r\n  features a number of agroprocessing factories. Mining has declined\r\n  in importance in recent years; high-grade iron ore deposits were\r\n  depleted by 1978, and health concerns have cut world demand for\r\n  asbestos. Exports of soft drink concentrate, sugar and wood pulp are\r\n  the main earners of hard currency. Surrounded by South Africa,\r\n  except for a short border with Mozambique, Swaziland is heavily\r\n  dependent on South Africa from which it receives nearly all of its\r\n  imports and to which it sends more than half of its exports.\r\n  Remittances from Swazi workers in South African mines supplement\r\n  domestically earned income by as much as 20%.

As the 20th century comes to an end,\r\n  this long successful formula is being undermined by high\r\n  unemployment; the rising cost of a \"cradle to the grave\" welfare\r\n  state; the decline of Sweden's competitive position in world\r\n  markets; and indecision over the country's role in the political and\r\n  economic integration of Europe.

It has a modern distribution system, excellent\r\n  internal and external communications, and a skilled labor force.\r\n  Timber, hydropower, and iron ore constitute the resource base of an\r\n  economy heavily oriented toward foreign trade. Privately owned firms\r\n  account for about 90% of industrial output, of which the engineering\r\n  sector accounts for 50% of output and exports. Agriculture accounts\r\n  for only 2% of GDP and 2% of the jobs. In recent years, however,\r\n  this extraordinarily favorable picture has been clouded by budgetary\r\n  difficulties, inflation, high unemployment, and a gradual loss of\r\n  competitiveness in international markets. Sweden has harmonized its\r\n  economic policies with those of the EU, which it joined at the start\r\n  of 1995. Sweden decided not to join the euro system at its outset in\r\n  January 1999 but plans to hold a referendum in 2000 on whether to\r\n  join. Annual GDP growth is forecast for 2.2% and 2.6% in 1999 and\r\n  2000 respectively. Budgetary problems and shaky business confidence\r\n  will constrain government plans to reduce unemployment.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$175 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 2.9% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$19,700 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 2.2%\r\n  industry: 30.5%\r\n  services: 67.3% (1997)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 3.7%\r\n  highest 10%: 20.1% (1992)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 2% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 4.552 million (1992)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: community, social and personal\r\n  services 38.3%, mining and manufacturing 21.2%, commerce, hotels,\r\n  and restaurants 14.1%, banking, insurance 9%, communications 7.2%,\r\n  construction 7%, agriculture, fishing, and forestry 3.2% (1991)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 6.3% plus about 5% in training programs (1998\r\n  est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $109.4 billion\r\n  expenditures: $146.1 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (FY95/96)\r\n\r\nIndustries: iron and steel, precision equipment (bearings, radio\r\n  and telephone parts, armaments), wood pulp and paper products,\r\n  processed foods, motor vehicles\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 4.4% (1998)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 135.192 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 9.75%\r\n  hydro: 37.52%\r\n  nuclear: 52.62%\r\n  other: 0.11% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 141.392 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 9.7 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 15.9 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: grains, sugar beets, potatoes;

The downturn in the global economy, however,\r\n  will have a cooling effect on the 1998 boom in the Swiss export\r\n  sector, including financial services, biotechnology,\r\n  pharmaceuticals, and special-purpose machines. A major downturn in\r\n  the Swiss economy should still be avoided, as consumer and capital\r\n  spending have picked up and will keep the economy moving in 1999.\r\n  GDP growth in 1999 is expected to come in around 1.4%. The growing\r\n  political and economic union of Europe suggests that Switzerland's\r\n  time-honored neutral separation is becoming increasingly obsolete.\r\n  Thus, when the surrounding trade partners launched the euro on 1\r\n  January 1999, their firms began prodding Swiss exporters and\r\n  importers to keep their accounts in euros.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$191.8 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 2% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$26,400 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 2.8%\r\n  industry: 31.1%\r\n  services: 66.1% (1995)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 2.9%\r\n  highest 10%: 28.6% (1982)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 0% (1998)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 3.8 million (850,000 foreign workers, mostly Italian)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: services 67%, manufacturing and\r\n  construction 29%, agriculture and forestry 4% (1995)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 3.6% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $32.66 billion\r\n  expenditures: $34.89 billion, including capital expenditures of $2.3\r\n  billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: machinery, chemicals, watches, textiles, precision\r\n  instruments\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 6% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 54.815 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 3.99%\r\n  hydro: 52.73%\r\n  nuclear: 43.27%\r\n  other: 0.01% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 53.765 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 24.2 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 23.15 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: grains, fruits, vegetables;

Box 29, Damascus\r\n\r\nFlag description: three equal horizontal bands of red (top),\r\n  white, and black with two small green five-pointed stars in a\r\n  horizontal line centered in the white band; similar to the flag of\r\n  Yemen, which has a plain white band and of Iraq, which has three\r\n  green stars (plus an Arabic inscription) in a horizontal line\r\n  centered in the white band; also similar to the flag of Egypt, which\r\n  has a symbolic eagle centered in the white band\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEconomy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEconomy--overview: Syria's predominantly statist economy is on a\r\n  shaky footing because of Damascus's failure to implement extensive\r\n  economic reform. The dominant agricultural sector remains\r\n  underdeveloped, with roughly 80% of agricultural land still\r\n  dependent on rain-fed sources. Although Syria has sufficient water\r\n  supplies in the aggregate at normal levels of precipitation, the\r\n  great distance between major water supplies and population centers\r\n  poses serious distribution problems. The water problem is\r\n  exacerbated by rapid population growth, industrial expansion, and\r\n  increased water pollution. Private investment is critical to the\r\n  modernization of the agricultural, energy, and export sectors. Oil\r\n  production is leveling off, and the efforts of the nonoil sector to\r\n  penetrate international markets have fallen short. Syria's\r\n  inadequate infrastructure, outmoded technological base, and weak\r\n  educational system make it vulnerable to future shocks and hamper\r\n  competition with neighbors such as Jordan and Israel.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$41.7 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 2% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$2,500 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 26%\r\n  industry: 21%\r\n  services: 53% (1997)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: 15%-25%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 15%-20% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 4.7 million (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: services 40%, agriculture 40%,\r\n  industry 20% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 12%-15% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $3.5 billion\r\n  expenditures: $4.2 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: petroleum, textiles, food processing, beverages,\r\n  tobacco, phosphate rock mining\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 0.2% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 19.3 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 63.73%\r\n  hydro: 36.27%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 19.3 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: wheat, barley, cotton, lentils, chickpeas,\r\n  olives, sugar beets;

Real growth in GDP has averaged\r\n  about 8.5% a year during the past three decades. Export growth has\r\n  been even faster and has provided the impetus for industrialization.\r\n  Inflation and unemployment are low, and foreign reserves are the\r\n  world's third largest. Agriculture contributes less than 3% to GDP,\r\n  down from 35% in 1952. Traditional labor-intensive industries are\r\n  steadily being moved off-shore and replaced with more capital- and\r\n  technology-intensive industries. Taiwan has become a major investor\r\n  in China, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, and\r\n  Vietnam. The tightening of labor markets has led to an influx of\r\n  foreign workers, both legal and illegal. Because of its conservative\r\n  financial approach and its entrepreneurial strengths, Taiwan\r\n  suffered little compared with many of its neighbors from \"the Asian\r\n  flu\" in 1998.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$362 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 4.8% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$16,500 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 2.7%\r\n  industry: 35.3%\r\n  services: 62% (1997)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 2.1% (1998)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 9.4 million (1997)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: services 52%, industry 38%,\r\n  agriculture 10% (1996)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 2.7% (1998)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $40 billion\r\n  expenditures: $55 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: electronics, textiles, chemicals, clothing, food\r\n  processing, plywood, sugar milling, cement, shipbuilding, petroleum\r\n  refining\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 7% (1997)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 134.906 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 63.2%\r\n  hydro: 7.1%\r\n  nuclear: 29.7%\r\n  other: 0% (1997)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 134.906 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: rice, wheat, corn, soybeans, vegetables,\r\n  fruit, tea;

Agriculture dominates the economy, with\r\n  cotton the most important crop. Mineral resources, varied but\r\n  limited in amount, include silver, gold, uranium, and tungsten.\r\n  Industry consists only of a large aluminum plant, hydropower\r\n  facilities, and small obsolete factories mostly in light industry\r\n  and food processing. The Tajikistani economy has been gravely\r\n  weakened by five years of civil conflict and by the loss of\r\n  subsidies from Moscow and of markets for its products. Tajikistan\r\n  thus depends on aid from Russia and Uzbekistan and on international\r\n  humanitarian assistance for much of its basic subsistence needs.\r\n  Even if the peace agreement of June 1997 is honored, the country\r\n  faces major problems in integrating refugees and former combatants\r\n  into the economy. Moreover, constant political turmoil and the\r\n  continued dominance by former communist officials have impeded the\r\n  introduction of meaningful economic reforms.

The economy is heavily dependent on agriculture, which\r\n  accounts for 56% of GDP, provides 85% of exports, and employs 90% of\r\n  the work force. Topography and climatic conditions, however, limit\r\n  cultivated crops to only 4% of the land area. Industry accounts for\r\n  15% of GDP and is mainly limited to processing agricultural products\r\n  and light consumer goods. The economic recovery program announced in\r\n  mid-1986 has generated notable increases in agricultural production\r\n  and financial support for the program by bilateral donors. The World\r\n  Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and bilateral donors have\r\n  provided funds to rehabilitate Tanzania's deteriorated economic\r\n  infrastructure. Growth in 1991-98 has featured a pickup in\r\n  industrial production and a substantial increase in output of\r\n  minerals, led by gold. Natural gas exploration in the Rufiji Delta\r\n  looks promising and production could start by 2002.

The crisis--which began in the country's financial sector--has\r\n  spread throughout the economy. After years of rapid economic growth\r\n  averaging 9% earlier this decade, the Thai economy contracted 0.4%\r\n  in 1997 and shrunk another 8.5% in 1998. In the years before the\r\n  crisis, Thailand ran persistent current account deficits. With the\r\n  depreciation of the Thai baht and the collapse of domestic demand,\r\n  however, imports have fallen off sharply--by more than 33%--and\r\n  Thailand posted a trade surplus of approximately $12 billion in\r\n  1998. Foreign investment for new projects, the long-time catalyst of\r\n  Thailand's economic growth, has also slowed. The CHUAN government\r\n  has closely adhered to the economic recovery program prescribed by\r\n  the IMF. The cooperation afforded Thailand stability in the value of\r\n  its currency in the second half of 1998 and helped replenish foreign\r\n  reserves. Tough measures--including passage of adequate bankruptcy\r\n  and foreclosure legislation as well as privatization of state-owned\r\n  companies and recapitalization of the financial sector--remain\r\n  undone. Bangkok is also trying to establish a social safety net for\r\n  those displaced by the current economic crisis and is working to\r\n  increase the quality of Thailand's labor force.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$369 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: -8.5% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$6,100 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 12%\r\n  industry: 39%\r\n  services: 49% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: 13.1% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 2.5%\r\n  highest 10%: 37.1% (1992)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 4.3% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 32.6 million (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture 54%, industry 15%,\r\n  services (including government) 31% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 4.5% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $24 billion\r\n  expenditures: $25 billion, including capital expenditures of $8\r\n  billion (FY96/97)\r\n\r\nIndustries: tourism;

Cocoa, coffee, and\r\n  cotton together generate about 30% of export earnings. Togo is\r\n  self-sufficient in basic foodstuffs when harvests are normal, with\r\n  occasional regional supply difficulties. In the industrial sector,\r\n  phosphate mining is by far the most important activity, although it\r\n  has suffered from the collapse of world phosphate prices and\r\n  increased foreign competition. Togo serves as a regional commercial\r\n  and trade center. The government's decade-long effort, supported by\r\n  the World Bank and the IMF, to implement economic reform measures,\r\n  encourage foreign investment, and bring revenues in line with\r\n  expenditures has stalled. Political unrest, including private and\r\n  public sector strikes throughout 1992 and 1993, jeopardized the\r\n  reform program, shrunk the tax base, and disrupted vital economic\r\n  activity. The 12 January 1994 devaluation of the currency by 50%\r\n  provided an important impetus to renewed structural adjustment;\r\n  these efforts were facilitated by the end of strife in 1994 and a\r\n  return to overt political calm. Progress depends on following\r\n  through on privatization, increased transparency in government\r\n  accounting to accommodate increased social service outlays, and\r\n  possible downsizing of the military, on which the regime has\r\n  depended to stay in place. However, in late 1998 the EU suspended\r\n  aid and trade preferences for Togo because of grave doubts over the\r\n  conduct of the presidential elections. The World Bank also suspended\r\n  its disbursements at yearend 1998 because Togo was unable to pay its\r\n  arrears.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$8.2 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 3.8% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$1,670 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 32%\r\n  industry: 23%\r\n  services: 45% (1995)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: 32.3% (1987-89 est.)\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 7.2% (1997)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 1.538 million (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture 65%, industry 5%, services\r\n  30% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $232 million\r\n  expenditures: $252 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: phosphate mining, agricultural processing, cement;\r\n  handicrafts, textiles, beverages\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 13.6% (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 88 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 93.18%\r\n  hydro: 6.82%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 408 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 320 million kWh (1996)\r\n  note: imports electricity from Ghana\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: coffee, cocoa, cotton, yams, cassava\r\n  (tapioca), corn, beans, rice, millet, sorghum;

Unemployment--a main cause of\r\n  the country's socioeconomic problems--is high, but has decreased to\r\n  its lowest point in six years. An investment boom in the energy\r\n  sector led to a surge in imports in 1997. The resulting trade\r\n  deficit is expected to return to a surplus once construction is\r\n  completed and the plants come on line. The petrochemical sector has\r\n  spurred growth in other related sectors, reinforcing the\r\n  government's commitment to economic diversification. Tourism is a\r\n  major foreign exchange earner, with 260,000 arrivals in 1995, 80%\r\n  from Europe.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$8.85 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 4.3% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$8,000 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 2.2%\r\n  industry: 44%\r\n  services: 53.8% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: 21% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 3.7% (1997)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 541,000 (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: construction and utilities 12.4%,\r\n  manufacturing, mining, and quarrying 14%, agriculture 9.5%, services\r\n  64.1% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 14% (June 1998)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $1.59 billion\r\n  expenditures: $1.54 billion, including capital expenditures of\r\n  $165.8 million (1997)\r\n\r\nIndustries: petroleum, chemicals, tourism, food processing,\r\n  cement, beverage, cotton textiles\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 7.5% (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 4 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 100%\r\n  hydro: 0%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 4 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: cocoa, sugarcane, rice, citrus, coffee,\r\n  vegetables;

Real growth averaged 4.0% in 1993-97 and reached\r\n  5.0% in 1998. Inflation has been moderate. Growth in tourism and\r\n  increased trade have been key elements in this steady growth.\r\n  Tunisia's association agreement with the European Union entered into\r\n  force on 1 March 1998, the first such accord between the EU and\r\n  Mediterranean countries to be activated. Under the agreement Tunisia\r\n  will gradually remove barriers to trade with the EU over the next\r\n  decade. Broader privatization, further liberalization of the\r\n  investment code to increase foreign investment, and improvements in\r\n  government efficiency are among the challenges for the future.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$49 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 5% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$5,200 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 14%\r\n  industry: 28%\r\n  services: 58% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: 14.1% (1990 est.)\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 2.3%\r\n  highest 10%: 30.7% (1990)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 3.3% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 3.3 million (1995 est.)\r\n  note: shortage of skilled labor\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: services 55%, industry 23%,\r\n  agriculture 22% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 15.6% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $5.8 billion\r\n  expenditures: $6.5 billion, including capital expenditures to $1.4\r\n  billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: petroleum, mining (particularly phosphate and iron\r\n  ore), tourism, textiles, footwear, food, beverages\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 4.2% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 7.535 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 99.54%\r\n  hydro: 0.46%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 7.616 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 81 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: olives, dates, oranges, almonds, grain,\r\n  sugar beets, grapes;

It has a strong and rapidly growing private\r\n  sector, yet the state still plays a major role in basic industry,\r\n  banking, transport, and communication. Its most important\r\n  industry--and largest exporter--is textiles and clothing, which is\r\n  almost entirely in private hands. The economic situation in recent\r\n  years has been marked by rapid growth coupled with partial success\r\n  in implementing structural reform measures. Inflation declined to\r\n  70% in 1998, down from 99% in 1997, but the public sector fiscal\r\n  deficit probably remained near 10% of GDP--due in large part to\r\n  interest payments which accounted for 42% of central government\r\n  spending in 1998. The government enacted a new tax law and speeded\r\n  up privatization in 1998 but made no progress on badly needed social\r\n  security reform. Ankara is trying to increase trade with other\r\n  countries in the region yet most of Turkey's trade is still with\r\n  OECD countries. Despite the implementation in January 1996 of a\r\n  customs union with the EU, foreign direct investment in the country\r\n  remains low--about $1 billion annually--perhaps because potential\r\n  investors are concerned about still-high inflation and the unsettled\r\n  political situation. Economic growth will remain about the same in\r\n  1999; inflation should decline further.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$425.4 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 2.8% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$6,600 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 14.4%\r\n  industry: 28.7%\r\n  services: 56.9% (1998)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 70% (1998)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 22.7 million (April 1998)\r\n  note: about 1.5 million Turks work abroad (1994)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture 42.5%, services 34.5%,\r\n  industry 23% (1996)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 10% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $44.4 billion\r\n  expenditures: $58.5 billion, including capital expenditures of $3.7\r\n  billion (1998)\r\n\r\nIndustries: textiles, food processing, autos, mining (coal,\r\n  chromite, copper, boron), steel, petroleum, construction, lumber,\r\n  paper\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 4.1% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 103 billion kWh (1997)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 62.4%\r\n  hydro: 37.1%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0.5% (1997)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 91.16 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 300 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 265 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: tobacco, cotton, grain, olives, sugar\r\n  beets, pulse, citrus;

One-half of its irrigated land is\r\n  planted in cotton, making it the world's tenth largest producer. It\r\n  also possesses the world's fifth largest reserves of natural gas and\r\n  substantial oil resources. Until the end of 1993, Turkmenistan had\r\n  experienced less economic disruption than other former Soviet states\r\n  because its economy received a boost from higher prices for oil and\r\n  gas and a sharp increase in hard currency earnings. In 1994,\r\n  Russia's refusal to export Turkmen gas to hard currency markets and\r\n  mounting debts of its major customers in the former USSR for gas\r\n  deliveries contributed to a sharp fall in industrial production and\r\n  caused the budget to shift from a surplus to a slight deficit. The\r\n  economy bottomed out in 1996, but high inflation continued.\r\n  Furthermore, with an authoritarian ex-communist regime in power and\r\n  a tribally based social structure, Turkmenistan has taken a cautious\r\n  approach to economic reform, hoping to use gas and cotton sales to\r\n  sustain its inefficient economy. In 1996, the government set in\r\n  place a stabilization program aimed at a unified and market-based\r\n  exchange rate, allocation of government credits by auction, and\r\n  strict limits on budget deficits. Privatization goals remain\r\n  limited. Turkmenistan is working hard to open new gas export\r\n  channels through Iran and Turkey to Europe, but these will take many\r\n  years to realize. In 1998 Turkmenistan faced revenue shortfalls due\r\n  to the continued lack of adequate export routes for natural gas and\r\n  obligations on extensive short-term external debt.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$7 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 5% (1998)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$1,630 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 18%\r\n  industry: 50%\r\n  services: 32% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 2.7%\r\n  highest 10%: 26.9% (1993)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 19.8% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 2.34 million (1996)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture and forestry 44%, industry\r\n  and construction 19%, other 37% (1996)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $521 million\r\n  expenditures: $548 million, including capital expenditures of $83\r\n  million (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: natural gas, oil, petroleum products, textiles, food\r\n  processing\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 9.484 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 99.96%\r\n  hydro: 0.04%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 7.134 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 2.7 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 350 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: cotton, grain;

The country has\r\n  no known mineral resources and few exports. Subsistence farming and\r\n  fishing are the primary economic activities. Government revenues\r\n  largely come from the sale of stamps and coins and worker\r\n  remittances. About 1,000 Tuvaluans work in Nauru in the phosphate\r\n  mining industry. Nauru has begun repatriating Tuvaluans, however, as\r\n  phosphate resources decline. Substantial income is received annually\r\n  from an international trust fund established in 1987 by Australia,\r\n  NZ, and the UK and supported also by Japan and South Korea. In an\r\n  effort to reduce its dependence on foreign aid, the government is\r\n  pursuing public sector reforms, including privatization of some\r\n  government functions and personnel cuts of up to 7%. In 1998, Tuvalu\r\n  began selling internet addresses in its TV domain and reportedly has\r\n  derived revenue from use of its area code for \"900\" lines. Low-lying\r\n  Tuvalu is particularly vulnerable to any future global warming.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$7.8 million (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 8.7% (1995)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$800 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NA%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 3.9% (average 1985-93)\r\n\r\nLabor force: NA\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: people make a living mainly through\r\n  exploitation of the sea, reefs, and atolls and from wages sent home\r\n  by those working abroad (mostly workers in the phosphate industry\r\n  and sailors)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $4.3 million\r\n  expenditures: $4.3 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1989 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: fishing, tourism, copra\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 3 million kWh (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: NA%\r\n  hydro: NA%\r\n  nuclear: NA%\r\n  other: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 3 million kWh (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1995)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: coconuts;

Agriculture is the most important\r\n  sector of the economy, employing over 80% of the work force. Coffee\r\n  is the major export crop and accounts for the bulk of export\r\n  revenues. Since 1986, the government--with the support of foreign\r\n  countries and international agencies--has acted to rehabilitate and\r\n  stabilize the economy by undertaking currency reform, raising\r\n  producer prices on export crops, increasing prices of petroleum\r\n  products, and improving civil service wages. The policy changes are\r\n  especially aimed at dampening inflation and boosting production and\r\n  export earnings. In 1990-98, the economy turned in a solid\r\n  performance based on continued investment in the rehabilitation of\r\n  infrastructure, improved incentives for production and exports,\r\n  reduced inflation, gradually improved domestic security, and the\r\n  return of exiled Indian-Ugandan entrepreneurs. Continuation of this\r\n  performance, while possible, appears difficult because of Ugandan\r\n  involvement in the war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\r\n  growing corruption within the government, and slippage in the\r\n  government's determination to press reforms.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$22.7 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 5.5% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$1,020 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 44%\r\n  industry: 17%\r\n  services: 39% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: 55% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 3%\r\n  highest 10%: 33.4% (1992)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 2.6% (1998)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 8.361 million (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture 86%, industry 4%, services\r\n  10% (1980 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $869 million\r\n  expenditures: $985 million, including capital expenditures of $69\r\n  million (FY95/96)\r\n\r\nIndustries: sugar, brewing, tobacco, cotton textiles, cement\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 19.7% (FY95/96)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 787 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 0.89%\r\n  hydro: 99.11%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 677 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 110 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: coffee, tea, cotton, tobacco, cassava\r\n  (tapioca), potatoes, corn, millet, pulses;

Its fertile black soil generated more than one-fourth of\r\n  Soviet agricultural output, and its farms provided substantial\r\n  quantities of meat, milk, grain, and vegetables to other republics.\r\n  Likewise, its diversified heavy industry supplied equipment and raw\r\n  materials to industrial and mining sites in other regions of the\r\n  former USSR. Ukraine depends on imports of energy, especially\r\n  natural gas. Shortly after the implosion of the USSR in December\r\n  1991, the Ukrainian Government liberalized most prices and erected a\r\n  legal framework for privatization, but widespread resistance to\r\n  reform within the government and the legislature soon stalled reform\r\n  efforts and led to some backtracking. Output in 1992-98 fell to less\r\n  than half the 1991 level. Loose monetary policies pushed inflation\r\n  to hyperinflationary levels in late 1993. Since his election in July\r\n  1994, President KUCHMA has pushed economic reforms, maintained\r\n  financial discipline, and tried to remove almost all remaining\r\n  controls over prices and foreign trade. The onset of the financial\r\n  crisis in Russia dashed Ukraine's hopes for its first year of\r\n  economic growth in 1998 due to a sharp fall in export revenue and\r\n  reduced domestic demand. Although administrative currency controls\r\n  will be lifted in early 1999, they are likely to be reimposed when\r\n  the hryvnia next comes under pressure.

Its wealth is based on oil and gas output (about 33% of\r\n  GDP), and the fortunes of the economy fluctuate with the prices of\r\n  those commodities. Since 1973, the UAE has undergone a profound\r\n  transformation from an impoverished region of small desert\r\n  principalities to a modern state with a high standard of living. At\r\n  present levels of production, oil and gas reserves should last for\r\n  over 100 years. The UAE Government is encouraging increased\r\n  privatization within the economy. Industrial development has picked\r\n  up in 1997-98, but lower world oil prices caused GDP to drop 5% in\r\n  1998.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$40 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: -5% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$17,400 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 3%\r\n  industry: 52%\r\n  services: 45% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 5% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 1.3 million (1997 est.)\r\n  note: 75% of the population in the 15-64 age group is non-national\r\n  (July 1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: services 60%, industry 32%,\r\n  agriculture 8% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $5.4 billion\r\n  expenditures: $5.8 billion, including capital expenditures of $350\r\n  million (1998 budget est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: petroleum, fishing, petrochemicals, construction\r\n  materials, some boat building, handicrafts, pearling\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 0% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 18 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 100%\r\n  hydro: 0%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 18 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: dates, vegetables, watermelons;

The\r\n  British Empire covered approximately one-fourth of the earth's\r\n  surface at its zenith. In the first half of the twentieth century\r\n  its strength was seriously depleted by two world wars. Since the end\r\n  of World War II, the British Empire has been dismantled, and Britain\r\n  has rebuilt itself into a prosperous, modern European nation with\r\n  significant international political, cultural, and economic\r\n  influence. As the twentieth century draws to a close, Britain is\r\n  debating the degree of its integration with continental Europe.\r\n  While a member of the EU, for the time being it is staying out of\r\n  the euro system introduced in January 1999. Constitutional reform,\r\n  including the House of Lords and the devolution of power to\r\n  Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, is an ongoing issue in Great\r\n  Britain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeography\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: Western Europe, islands including the northern\r\n  one-sixth of the island of Ireland between the North Atlantic Ocean\r\n  and the North Sea, northwest of France\r\n\r\nGeographic coordinates: 54 00 N, 2 00 W\r\n\r\nMap references: Europe\r\n\r\nArea:\r\n  total: 244,820 sq km\r\n  land: 241,590 sq km\r\n  water: 3,230 sq km\r\n  note: includes Rockall and Shetland Islands\r\n\r\nArea--comparative: slightly smaller than Oregon\r\n\r\nLand boundaries:\r\n  total: 360 km\r\n  border countries: Ireland 360 km\r\n\r\nCoastline: 12,429 km\r\n\r\nMaritime claims:\r\n  continental shelf: as defined in continental shelf orders or in\r\n  accordance with agreed upon boundaries\r\n  exclusive fishing zone: 200 nm\r\n  territorial sea: 12 nm\r\n\r\nClimate: temperate;

Over the\r\n  past two decades the government has greatly reduced public ownership\r\n  and contained the growth of social welfare programs. Agriculture is\r\n  intensive, highly mechanized, and efficient by European standards,\r\n  producing about 60% of food needs with only 1% of the labor force.\r\n  The UK has large coal, natural gas, and oil reserves; primary energy\r\n  production accounts for 10% of GDP, one of the highest shares of any\r\n  industrial nation. Services, particularly banking, insurance, and\r\n  business services, account by far for the largest proportion of GDP\r\n  while industry continues to decline in importance, now employing\r\n  only 18% of the work force. Economic growth is slowing, and Britain\r\n  may experience a short recession in 1999. As a result, unemployment\r\n  probably will begin to rise again. The BLAIR government has put off\r\n  the question of participation in the euro system until after the\r\n  next election, not expected until 2001, but Chancellor of the\r\n  Exchequer BROWN is committed to preparing the British economy for\r\n  eventual membership.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$1.252 trillion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 2.6% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$21,200 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 1.5%\r\n  industry: 31.5%\r\n  services: 67% (1997)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: 17%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 2.4%\r\n  highest 10%: 24.7% (1986)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 2.7% (1998)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 28.8 million (1998)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: services 68.9%, manufacturing and\r\n  construction 17.5%, government 11.3%, energy 1.2%, agriculture 1.1%\r\n  (1996)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 7.5% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $487.7 billion\r\n  expenditures: $492.6 billion, including capital expenditures of\r\n  $23.1 billion (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: production machinery including machine tools,\r\n  electric power equipment, automation equipment, railroad equipment,\r\n  shipbuilding, aircraft, motor vehicles and parts, electronics and\r\n  communications equipment, metals, chemicals, coal, petroleum, paper\r\n  and paper products, food processing, textiles, clothing, and other\r\n  consumer goods\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 0.5% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 309.672 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 72.28%\r\n  hydro: 1.28%\r\n  nuclear: 26.33%\r\n  other: 0.11% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 326.322 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 16.65 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: cereals, oilseed, potatoes, vegetables;\r\n  cattle, sheep, poultry;

The economy is marked by steady growth, low\r\n  unemployment, low inflation, and rapid advances in technology. The\r\n  biggest cloud over this affluent society is the distribution of\r\n  gains--since 1975 most of the increase in national income has gone to\r\n  the 20% of people at the top of the income ladder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeography\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: North America, bordering both the North Atlantic Ocean\r\n  and the North Pacific Ocean, between Canada and Mexico\r\n\r\nGeographic coordinates: 38 00 N, 97 00 W\r\n\r\nMap references: North America\r\n\r\nArea:\r\n  total: 9,629,091 sq km\r\n  land: 9,158,960 sq km\r\n  water: 470,131 sq km\r\n  note: includes only the 50 states and District of Columbia\r\n\r\nArea--comparative: about one-half the size of Russia;

In this\r\n  market-oriented economy, private individuals and business firms make\r\n  most of the decisions, and government buys needed goods and services\r\n  predominantly in the private marketplace. US business firms enjoy\r\n  considerably greater flexibility than their counterparts in Western\r\n  Europe and Japan in decisions to expand capital plant, lay off\r\n  surplus workers, and develop new products. At the same time, they\r\n  face higher barriers to entry in their rivals' home markets than the\r\n  barriers to entry of foreign firms in US markets. US firms are at or\r\n  near the forefront in technological advances, especially in\r\n  computers and in medical, aerospace, and military equipment,\r\n  although their advantage has narrowed since the end of World War II.\r\n  The onrush of technology largely explains the gradual development of\r\n  a \"two-tier labor market\" in which those at the bottom lack the\r\n  education and the professional/technical skills of those at the top\r\n  and, more and more, fail to get pay raises, health insurance\r\n  coverage, and other benefits. Since 1975, practically all the gains\r\n  in household income have gone to the top 20% of households. The\r\n  years 1994-98 witnessed solid increases in real output, low\r\n  inflation rates, and a drop in unemployment to below 5%. Long-term\r\n  problems include inadequate investment in economic infrastructure,\r\n  rapidly rising medical costs of an aging population, sizable trade\r\n  deficits, and stagnation of family income in the lower economic\r\n  groups. The outlook for 1999 is for GDP growth somewhat below\r\n  1998's, continued low inflation, and about the same level of\r\n  unemployment. Two shadows for 1999 are the severe financial crises\r\n  in East Asia and Russia and the exuberant level of stock prices in\r\n  relation to corporate earnings.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$8.511 trillion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 3.9% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$31,500 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 2%\r\n  industry: 23%\r\n  services: 75% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: 13% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 1.5%\r\n  highest 10%: 28.5% (1994)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 1.6% (1998)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 137.7 million (includes unemployed) (1998)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: managerial and professional 29.6%,\r\n  technical, sales and administrative support 29.3%, services 13.6%,\r\n  manufacturing, mining, transportation, and crafts 24.8%, farming,\r\n  forestry, and fishing 2.7% (1998)\r\n  note: figures exclude the unemployed\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 4.5% (1998)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $1.722 trillion\r\n  expenditures: $1.653 trillion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1998)\r\n\r\nIndustries: leading industrial power in the world, highly\r\n  diversified and technologically advanced;

Uzbekistan is now the world's third largest cotton\r\n  exporter, a major producer of gold and natural gas, and a regionally\r\n  significant producer of chemicals and machinery. Following\r\n  independence in December 1991, the government sought to prop up its\r\n  Soviet-style command economy with subsidies and tight controls on\r\n  production and prices. Faced with high rates of inflation, however,\r\n  the government began to reform in mid-1994, by introducing tighter\r\n  monetary policies, expanding privatization, slightly reducing the\r\n  role of the state in the economy, and improving the environment for\r\n  foreign investors. Nevertheless, the state continues to be a\r\n  dominating influence in the economy, and reforms have so far failed\r\n  to bring about much-needed structural changes. The IMF suspended\r\n  Uzbekistan's $185 million standby arrangement in late 1996 because\r\n  of governmental steps that made impossible fulfillment of Fund\r\n  conditions. Uzbekistan has responded to the negative external\r\n  conditions generated by the Asian and Russian financial crises by\r\n  tightening export and currency controls within its already largely\r\n  closed economy.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$59.2 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 1% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$2,500 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 26%\r\n  industry: 27%\r\n  services: 47% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 40% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 11.9 million (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture and forestry 44%, industry\r\n  20%, services 36% (1995)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 5% plus another 10% underemployed (December\r\n  1996 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $4.4 billion\r\n  expenditures: $4.7 billion, including capital expenditures of $1.1\r\n  billion (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: textiles, food processing, machine building,\r\n  metallurgy, natural gas\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 5% (1998)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 47.9 billion kWh (1998)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 84.18%\r\n  hydro: 15.82%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 43.885 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 5.6 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 6.5 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: cotton, vegetables, fruits, grain;

As a\r\n  result, the steep downturn in international oil prices has had a\r\n  severe impact on the economy; fiscal cuts spurred by the loss of\r\n  revenues, high interest rates, and the sharp downturn in export\r\n  earnings drove the economy into recession in 1998. The recession\r\n  continued into 1999 with oil prices forecast to stay relatively low,\r\n  but rising. Although the government has pursued moderate austerity\r\n  measures to address the downturn in revenues, Venezuela's ongoing\r\n  reform program has largely stalled. Pressure on the\r\n  bolivar--overvalued by as much as 40%--was also significant through\r\n  much of 1998, increasing the probability of an adjustment of the\r\n  currency in 1999. Newly elected President Hugo CHAVEZ will be hard\r\n  pressed to address Venezuela's many economic ills. He has promised\r\n  to strike a balance between reforms designed to address the\r\n  structural deformities of the economy and addressing declining\r\n  living standards. CHAVEZ has sought to play down the populism that\r\n  marked his political campaign for the presidency in an effort to\r\n  allay investor concerns. The wide range of viewpoints represented on\r\n  CHAVEZ's economic team is likely to make rapid implementation of a\r\n  coherent policy difficult.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$194.5 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: -0.9% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$8,500 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 4%\r\n  industry: 63%\r\n  services: 33% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: 31.3% (1989 est.)\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 1.5%\r\n  highest 10%: 35.6% (1995)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 29.9% (1998)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 9.2 million\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: services 64%, industry 23%,\r\n  agriculture 13% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 11.5% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $11.99 billion\r\n  expenditures: $11.48 billion, including capital expenditures of $3\r\n  billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: petroleum, iron ore mining, construction materials,\r\n  food processing, textiles, steel, aluminum, motor vehicle assembly\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 0.5% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 73 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 20.55%\r\n  hydro: 79.45%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 72.85 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 150 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: corn, sorghum, sugarcane, rice, bananas,\r\n  vegetables, coffee;

Substantial progress has been achieved\r\n  over the past 10 years in moving forward from an extremely low\r\n  starting point, though the regional downturn is now limiting that\r\n  progress. GDP growth of 8.5% in 1997 fell to 4% in 1998. These\r\n  numbers masked some major difficulties that are emerging in economic\r\n  performance. Many domestic industries, including coal, cement,\r\n  steel, and paper, have reported large stockpiles of inventory and\r\n  tough competition from more efficient foreign producers, giving\r\n  Vietnam a trade deficit of $3.3 billion in 1997. While disbursements\r\n  of aid and foreign direct investment have risen, they are not large\r\n  enough to finance the rapid increase in imports; and it is widely\r\n  believed that Vietnam may be using short-term trade credits to\r\n  bridge the gap--a risky strategy that could result in a foreign\r\n  exchange crunch. Meanwhile, Vietnamese authorities continue to move\r\n  slowly toward implementing the structural reforms needed to\r\n  revitalize the economy and produce more competitive, export-driven\r\n  industries. Privatization of state enterprises remains bogged down\r\n  in political controversy, while the country's dynamic private sector\r\n  is denied both financing and access to markets. Reform of the\r\n  banking sector is proceeding slowly, raising concerns that the\r\n  country will be unable to tap sufficient domestic savings to\r\n  maintain current high levels of growth. Administrative and legal\r\n  barriers are also causing costly delays for foreign investors and\r\n  are raising similar doubts about Vietnam's ability to maintain the\r\n  inflow of foreign capital. Ideological bias in favor of state\r\n  intervention and control of the economy is slowing progress toward a\r\n  more liberalized investment environment.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$134.8 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 4% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$1,770 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 28%\r\n  industry: 30%\r\n  services: 42% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: 50.9% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 3.5%\r\n  highest 10%: 29% (1993)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 9% (1998)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 32.7 million\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture 65%, industry and services\r\n  35% (1990 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 25% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $5.6 billion\r\n  expenditures: $6 billion, including capital expenditures of $1.7\r\n  billion (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: food processing, garments, shoes, machine building,\r\n  mining, cement, chemical fertilizer, glass, tires, oil, coal, steel,\r\n  paper\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 12% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 14.88 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 12.1%\r\n  hydro: 84%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 3.9% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 14.88 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: paddy rice, corn, potatoes, rubber,\r\n  soybeans, coffee, tea, bananas;

The\r\n  islands normally host 2 million visitors a year. The number of US\r\n  tourists in the first five months of 1996 was down by 55% from the\r\n  same period in 1995, the lingering result of the fierce hurricanes\r\n  of 1995. Unemployment rose sharply in 1996. The manufacturing sector\r\n  consists of textile, electronics, pharmaceutical, and watch assembly\r\n  plants. The agricultural sector is small, with most food being\r\n  imported. International business and financial services are a small\r\n  but growing component of the economy. One of the world's largest\r\n  petroleum refineries is at Saint Croix. A major economic problem at\r\n  the beginning of 1997 was the more than $1 billion in governmental\r\n  arrears, income tax refunds, payments to vendors, and overdue wages.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$1.2 billion (1987 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$12,500 (1987 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NA%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): NA%\r\n\r\nLabor force: 47,443 (1990 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture 1%, industry 20%, services\r\n  62%, other 17% (1990)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 6.2% (March 1994)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $364.4 million\r\n  expenditures: $364.4 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1990 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: tourism, petroleum refining, watch assembly, rum\r\n  distilling, construction, pharmaceuticals, textiles, electronics\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 1.02 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 100%\r\n  hydro: 0%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 1.02 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 0 kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: truck garden products, fruit, vegetables,\r\n  sorghum;

Permanent status negotiations began on 5 May\r\n  1996, but have not resumed since the initial meeting. Under the DOP,\r\n  Israel agreed to transfer certain powers and responsibilities to the\r\n  Palestinian Authority, which includes a Palestinian Legislative\r\n  Council elected in January 1996, as part of interim self-governing\r\n  arrangements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. A transfer of powers\r\n  and responsibilities for the Gaza Strip and Jericho took place\r\n  pursuant to the Israel-PLO 4 May 1994 Cairo Agreement on the Gaza\r\n  Strip and the Jericho Area and in additional areas of the West Bank\r\n  pursuant to the Israel-PLO 28 September 1995 Interim Agreement, the\r\n  Israel-PLO 15 January 1997 Protocol Concerning Redeployment in\r\n  Hebron, and the Israel-PLO 23 October 1998 Wye River Memorandum. The\r\n  DOP provides that Israel will retain responsibility during the\r\n  transitional period for external security and for internal security\r\n  and public order of settlements and Israelis. Permanent status is to\r\n  be determined through direct negotiations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeography\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: Middle East, west of Jordan\r\n\r\nGeographic coordinates: 32 00 N, 35 15 E\r\n\r\nMap references: Middle East\r\n\r\nArea:\r\n  total: 5,860 sq km\r\n  land: 5,640 sq km\r\n  water: 220 sq km\r\n  note: includes West Bank, Latrun Salient, and the northwest quarter\r\n  of the Dead Sea, but excludes Mt.

Real per capita GDP for the West\r\n  Bank and Gaza Strip (WBGS) declined 36.1% between 1992 and 1996\r\n  owing to the combined effect of falling aggregate incomes and robust\r\n  population growth. The downturn in economic activity was largely the\r\n  result of Israeli closure policies--the imposition of generalized\r\n  border closures in response to security incidents in Israel--which\r\n  disrupted previously established labor and commodity market\r\n  relationships between Israel and the WBGS. The most serious negative\r\n  social effect of this downturn has been the emergence of chronic\r\n  unemployment; average unemployment rates in the WBGS during the\r\n  1980s were generally under 5%, by the mid-1990s this level had risen\r\n  to over 20%. Since 1997 Israel's use of comprehensive closures has\r\n  decreased and, in 1998, Israel implemented new policies to reduce\r\n  the impact of closures and other security procedures on the movement\r\n  of Palestinian goods and labor. These positive changes to the\r\n  conduct of economic activity, combined with international donor\r\n  pledges of over $3 billion made to the Palestinian Authority in\r\n  November, may fuel a moderate economic recovery in 1999.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$3.1 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 2.2% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$2,000 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 33%\r\n  industry: 25%\r\n  services: 42% (1995 est., includes Gaza Strip)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: NA%\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: NA%\r\n  highest 10%: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 7.6% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: NA\r\n  note: excluding Israeli settlers\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: agriculture 13%, industry 13%,\r\n  commerce, restaurants, and hotels 12%, construction 8%, other\r\n  services 54% (1996)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 17.3% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $816 million\r\n  expenditures: $866 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1997 est.)\r\n  note: includes Gaza Strip\r\n\r\nIndustries: generally small family businesses that produce\r\n  cement, textiles, soap, olive-wood carvings, and mother-of-pearl\r\n  souvenirs; the Israelis have established some small-scale, modern\r\n  industries in the settlements and industrial centers\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: NA kWh\r\n  note: most electricity imported from Israel; East Jerusalem Electric\r\n  Company buys and distributes electricity to Palestinians in East\r\n  Jerusalem and its concession in the West Bank; the Israel Electric\r\n  Company directly supplies electricity to most Jewish residents and\r\n  military facilities; at the same time, some Palestinian\r\n  municipalities, such as Nabulus and Janin, generate their own\r\n  electricity from small power plants\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: NA%\r\n  hydro: NA%\r\n  nuclear: NA%\r\n  other: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: NA kWh\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: NA kWh\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: NA kWh\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: olives, citrus, vegetables; beef, dairy\r\n  products\r\n\r\nExports: $781 million (f.o.b., 1997 est.)

Western\r\n  Europe's economies grew at roughly 2.5%, not enough to cut deeply\r\n  into the region's high unemployment; these economies produced 21% of\r\n  GWP. China, the second largest economy in the world, continued its\r\n  rapid growth and accounted for 11% of GWP. Japan posted a decline of\r\n  2.6% in 1998 and its share in GWP dropped to 7.4%. As usual, the 15\r\n  successor nations of the USSR and the other old Warsaw Pact nations\r\n  experienced widely different rates of growth. Russia's national\r\n  product dropped by 5% whereas the nations of central and eastern\r\n  Europe grew by 3.4% on average. The developing nations varied widely\r\n  in their growth results, with many countries facing population\r\n  increases that eat up gains in output. Externally, the nation-state,\r\n  as a bedrock economic-political institution, is steadily losing\r\n  control over international flows of people, goods, funds, and\r\n  technology. Internally, the central government finds its control\r\n  over resources slipping as separatist regional movements--typically\r\n  based on ethnicity--gain momentum, e.g., in the successor states of\r\n  the former Soviet Union, in the former Yugoslavia, in India, and in\r\n  Canada. In Western Europe, governments face the difficult political\r\n  problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order\r\n  to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment.\r\n  The addition of more than 80 million people each year to an already\r\n  overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of pollution,\r\n  desertification, underemployment, epidemics, and famine. Because of\r\n  their own internal problems, the industrialized countries have\r\n  inadequate resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of\r\n  the world, which, at least from the economic point of view, are\r\n  becoming further marginalized. In 1998, serious financial\r\n  difficulties in several high-growth East Asia countries cast a\r\n  shadow over short-term global economic prospects. The introduction\r\n  of the euro as the common currency of much of Western Europe in\r\n  January 1999 poses serious economic risks because of varying levels\r\n  of income and cultural and political differences among the\r\n  participating nations.

Yemen has\r\n  embarked on an IMF-supported structural adjustment program designed\r\n  to modernize and streamline the economy, which has led to foreign\r\n  debt relief and restructuring. Yemen will work in 1999 to maintain\r\n  tight control over spending and implement additional components of\r\n  the IMF program.

Inflation, while\r\n  slowing somewhat, continues to be a major concern to the CHILUBA\r\n  government. Zambia's copper mining sector, which accounts for over\r\n  80% of the nation's foreign currency intake, is struggling.\r\n  Production rates are down as are world copper prices. Aid cuts by\r\n  Zambia's donors, arising out of concern for the November 1996 flawed\r\n  election, also have damaged Zambia's economic prospects. Urged by\r\n  the World Bank, Zambia has embarked on a privatization program which\r\n  is to include the all-important copper industry.

Its\r\n  involvement in the war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, for\r\n  example, has already drained hundreds of millions of dollars from\r\n  the economy. Badly needed support from the IMF suffers delays in\r\n  part because of the country's failure to meet budgetary goals.\r\n  Inflation rose from an annual rate of 25% in January 1998 to 47% in\r\n  December and will almost certainly continue to increase in 1999. The\r\n  economy is being steadily weakened by AIDS; Zimbabwe has one of the\r\n  highest rates of infection in the world. Per capita GDP, which is\r\n  twice the average of the poorer sub-Saharan nations, will increase\r\n  little if any in the near-term, and Zimbabwe will suffer continued\r\n  frustrations in developing its agricultural and mineral resources.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity--$26.2 billion (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--real growth rate: 1.5% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--per capita: purchasing power parity?$2,400 (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP--composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 28%\r\n  industry: 32%\r\n  services: 40% (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation below poverty line: 25.5% (1990-91 est.)\r\n\r\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\r\n  lowest 10%: 1.8%\r\n  highest 10%: 46.9% (1990)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 32% (1998 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 5 million (1997 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force--by occupation: NA\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: at least 45% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $2.5 billion\r\n  expenditures: $2.9 billion, including capital expenditures of $279\r\n  million (FY96/97 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: mining (coal, clay, numerous metallic and nonmetallic\r\n  ores), copper, steel, nickel, tin, wood products, cement, chemicals,\r\n  fertilizer, clothing and footwear, foodstuffs, beverages\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 10% (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production: 8.5 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--production by source:\r\n  fossil fuel: 71.76%\r\n  hydro: 28.24%\r\n  nuclear: 0%\r\n  other: 0% (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--consumption: 10.769 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--exports: 1 million kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nElectricity--imports: 2.27 billion kWh (1996)\r\n\r\nAgriculture--products: corn, cotton, tobacco, wheat, coffee,\r\n  sugarcane, peanuts;

the\r\nUS--have not adopted the International System of Units (SI, or metric\r\nsystem) as their official system of weights and measures. Although use\r\nof the metric system has been sanctioned by law in the US since 1866,\r\nit has been slow in displacing the American adaptation of the British\r\nImperial System known as the US Customary System. The US is the only\r\nindustrialized nation that does not mainly use the metric system in\r\nits commercial and standards activities, but there is increasing\r\nacceptance in science, medicine, government, and many sectors of\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=====================================================================\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppendix F: Cross-Reference List of Country Data Codes\r\n\r\n\r\nFIPS 10-4: Countries, Dependencies, Areas of Special\r\nSovereignty, and Their Principal Administrative Divisions\r\n(FIPS PUB 10-4) is maintained by the Office of the\r\nGeographer and Global Issues (Department of State) and\r\npublished by the National Institute of Standards and\r\nTechnology (Department of Commerce). These two-character\r\nalphabetic codes are included in the text of the Factbook in\r\nthe Data code entry under the Government category. FIPS 10-4\r\ncodes are intended for general use throughout the US\r\nGovernment, especially in activities associated with the\r\nmission of the Department of State and national defense\r\nprograms.\r\n\r\nISO 3166: Codes for the Representation of Names of Countries\r\n(ISO 3166) is prepared by the International Organization for\r\nStandardization. ISO 3166 includes two- and three-character\r\nalphabetic codes and three-digit numeric codes that may be\r\nneeded for activities involving exchange of data with\r\ninternational organizations that have adopted that standard.\r\nExcept for the numeric codes, ISO 3166 codes have been\r\nadopted in the US as FIPS 104-1: American National Standard\r\nCodes for the Representation of Names of Countries,\r\nDependencies, and Areas of Special Sovereignty for\r\nInformation Interchange.\r\n\r\nInternet: This is a provisional compilation that generally\r\nagrees with the ISO 3166 two-character

country codes. The names and limits of the following oceans and\r\nseas are not always directly comparable because of differences in the\r\ncustomers, needs, and requirements of the individual organizations.\r\nEven the number of principal water bodies varies from organization to\r\norganization. Factbook users, for example, find the Atlantic Ocean and\r\nPacific Ocean entries useful, but none of the following standards\r\ninclude those oceans in their entirety. Nor is there any provision for\r\ncombining codes or overcodes to aggregate water bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrincipal Oceans and Seas of\r\nthe World With Hydrographic\r\nCodes by Institution\r\n\r\n
