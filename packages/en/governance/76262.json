This we have attempted to do thoroughly\r\nand fairly. Great caution has been used in making statements and no\r\ninference has been drawn that could be considered in any way forced or\r\ndoubtful.\r\n\r\nThere are doubtless many persons to whom some of the facts and\r\nconclusions here presented, may seem strange or even startling, and\r\nto such it must be said that the authorities quoted are generally men\r\nwhose reputation for accuracy and sound judgment stands so high that\r\nthey cannot afford to make a mistake or a loose assertion.\r\n\r\nThe work has involved much labor and historical research, and the\r\nauthor believes that the information contained in the following pages\r\ncannot fail to be of value to those who are interested in any phase\r\nof the beer question, whether as brewers, legislators or students\r\nof sociology. The end proposed to be served is that of temperance,\r\nand the method suggested is one that has been successfully tried in\r\nother countries. From the total abstinence party we ask the candid\r\nexamination of our facts and arguments that is due to a fair statement\r\nfrom all who claim respect for their own opinions, and are honest\r\nfriends of real temperance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                BEER,\r\n\r\n                 ITS HISTORY AND ITS ECONOMIC VALUE\r\n\r\n                                AS A\r\n\r\n                         NATIONAL BEVERAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n                  PRELIMINARY VIEW OF THE SUBJECT.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs extremes do and must perforce exist, the noblest philosophy of life\r\nis _compromise_.\r\n\r\nTemperance then is the truest medium between total abstinence and\r\nexcess, and in the same manner, beer occupies the medium position\r\nbetween ardent spirits and water. This fact is of the greatest\r\nimportance, and until the public thoroughly understands the\r\ndifferences, whether from a moral, social, economic, or sanitary point\r\nof view, between distilled and fermented liquors, or in other words,\r\nbeer and whisky there can be no hope of proper legislation as to the\r\ntraffic in these articles. This legislation is now greatly influenced\r\nby the public advocates of total abstinence, among whom, if their own\r\nrepeated claims be taken into account we might expect to find only\r\ndisinterested, high-minded philanthropists. But it is notorious that\r\ntheir ranks are largely swelled by ignorant, ambitious or foolish men,\r\nwhose vanity or pecuniary interest determines their action, and whose\r\npersistence and numerical strength will constitute an effective power\r\nuntil legislative bodies and the people at large are more thoroughly\r\ninformed as to the actual experience of countries in which the problem\r\nhas been dispassionately studied and brought to a successful solution.\r\nIn too many of our states the liquor laws represent the triumph of\r\nignorance and prejudice over reason and the welfare of the community.\r\nWe hold that the solution of the temperance question is to be found\r\nthrough fermented liquors, and “BEER AGAINST WHISKY” is our motto.\r\n\r\nBefore coming, as we shall do later in this book, to a detailed\r\nexamination of the facts in regard to the use of beer, it may be well\r\nto declare briefly our position, and give some indication of the kind\r\nof testimony that will be more fully displayed under a separate heading.\r\n\r\nWe hold that the production and sale of beer is so far from being\r\nsubversive of public morals, that experience in all countries where\r\nbeer is the national beverage, demonstrates precisely the opposite\r\nof this position. We hold too, that the use of beer is not merely\r\nindifferent, but, within the limits of temperance (_i. e._ moderation),\r\na good and rational means of developing the mental and bodily powers of\r\nman.\r\n\r\nWe cannot join in the gratulations of those who now—as they say—so\r\nenthusiastically enjoy the blessings of total abstinence. During the\r\nlast thirty years we have seen something of the operation of this\r\nenthusiasm, not only in Great Britain, but in the native state of the\r\noriginator of the movement in this country, and we find it impossible\r\nto assent to the famous proposition that a pledged abstainer is a\r\ndrunkard saved. We have been convinced that a pledged abstainer is too\r\noften a man who drinks in secret and thus adds hypocrisy to his other\r\nsins.\r\n\r\nNotice this passage from evidence given before a state committee\r\nappointed to inquire into the action of the restrictive laws. The Hon.\r\nJames H. Duncan of Haverhill, says:\r\n\r\n“My observation and convictions are, that temperance has not been\r\npromoted by the prohibitory law; that the temperance of our people is\r\nnot so good now as before the passage of the law; it has no efficacy in\r\nchecking intemperance and the evils that result from it; it has been\r\nproductive of more mischief than good, and I think it an unwise act.\r\nIt is impossible to make that a crime which is not made a crime by the\r\ndivine law, and the use of beer, wine and cider cannot by any effort be\r\nmade a crime _per se_, yet the prohibitory statute makes it a crime to\r\nsell either, and worse, it is a crime for a carrier to carry them. No\r\nwonder that such a law demoralizes the community, for a vast amount of\r\nlying and fraud have been called into existence through its agency.”\r\n\r\nThe Rev. George Putnam, D.D., said; “I believe and know that the\r\nprohibitory law produces demoralization, and disrespect for a law that\r\ncannot be enforced. It demoralizes jurors and witnesses. It demoralizes\r\nthe buyers and sellers of liquors, inducing them to resort to all\r\nmanner of frauds, tricks and evasions to do that unlawfully which they\r\ncannot do lawfully. It is injurious to the conscience of the people to\r\nbe always violating this law; and so far as liquor selling is concerned\r\nthe law has done no good.”\r\n\r\nThese extracts and many others to be given later, go to prove that it\r\nis most unwise to interfere with the social habits of a people, that\r\nit is dangerous for a state to do so, and that, as a matter of fact,\r\ntemperance is not promoted by a prohibitory law. Public testimony\r\nthat such laws are a blunder, or worse, has been given by such men\r\nas John Quincy Adams, Professor Agassiz of Cambridge, Rev. Leonard\r\nBacon, D. D., of Connecticut, Professor Bigelow of Boston, Professor\r\nEdward Clark of Boston, ex-Governor Clifford, the late Right Rev.\r\nM. Eastburn, D. D., the late Governor Andrews, and Oliver Wendell\r\nHolmes, all of Boston, ex-Governor Washburn of Massachusetts, Professor\r\nBowen of Cambridge, General Burrell of Roxbury, Hon. Joel Parker of\r\nCambridge, Judge Patch of Lowell, Hon. James H. Duncan of Haverhill,\r\nMass., Rev. George Putnam, D. D., of Mass., Dr. Garcelon, Governor\r\nof Maine, Dr. Willard Parker of the Inebriate Asylum at Binghamton,\r\nN. Y., A. Schwartz, Esq., the distinguished editor and publisher of\r\nthe _Americanischer Bierbrauer_, and many others, comprising eminent\r\nstatesmen, judges, and divines of all the states of the Union.\r\n\r\nOur legislators should consider it their solemn duty to protect\r\nand foster the manufacture and sale of pure beer, and should frame\r\nsuch laws as will protect the people against imposition and secure\r\nthe manufacture of an article that shall not only be made from good\r\nmaterials, but be thoroughly well brewed and wholesome, and sold at a\r\nmoderate price.\r\n\r\nSuch a course will prove a blessing to mankind, and we do not hesitate\r\nto say, that notwithstanding what fools or fanatics may say, preach or\r\nwrite, Americans, and particularly those of the Eastern States, who\r\nare probably the most practical people on the face of the globe, will\r\nbefore long adopt beer as their national beverage. In doing so they\r\nwill but follow the example of the most civilized countries of Europe;\r\nand it will soon be recognized that every brewery and every beer saloon\r\nhelps to loosen the grasp which alcohol has on any country where\r\ndistilled liquors are habitually used. Thomas Jefferson, writing Dec.\r\n13, 1818, to M. de Neuville in reference to intemperance and the use of\r\nlight wines as a substitute for spirits, says, “No nation is drunken\r\nwhere wine is cheap.” Beer is yet less alcoholic than wine of any sort\r\nand has advantages of its own which will be discussed in due place.\r\nExperience shows that sound, wholesome beer at a moderate cost is the\r\nbest catholicon yet discovered for intemperance. It weans a people\r\ngradually but surely from strong drink and brings happiness, content\r\nand morality in the place of dissipation and suffering. But it must\r\nbe good, cheap and accessible, and the responsibility of making it so\r\nrests with our lawgivers. The poorer classes are those who need it most\r\nand cause most injury and loss to the state when for lack of it they\r\nconsume ardent spirits—and these cheap and adulterated.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all difficulties considerable progress has been made, as is\r\nshown by a consumption last year of more than nine million (9,473,361)\r\nbarrels of beer, which is the best evidence of a step in the right\r\ndirection towards national temperance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n                       EARLY HISTORY OF BEER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to say where and when the brewing of beer began, for\r\nthe earliest historical records show its general use.\r\n\r\nIt is mentioned by Manathos, High Priest of Heliopolis, an Egyptian of\r\nGreek education, who lived about 300 B. C. and by command of Ptolemaus\r\nPhiladelphus translated the old Egyptian history into Greek. He says\r\nthat the Egyptians, thousands of years before, had beer, and that its\r\ninvention was attributed to Osiris, a divinity representing all the\r\nbeneficent principles, also that celebrated breweries existed at that\r\ntime at El Kahirch, the Cairo of Europeans, and at Pelusinum on the\r\nriver Nile.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks had their _zythos_ (beer) as also their wine of barley, _ek\r\nkrithon methu_, and the _oinos krithinos_ as mentioned by Sophocles,\r\nÆschylus, 470 B. C., Diodorus of Sicily and Pliny. Xenephon in his\r\naccount of the Retreat of the Ten Thousand, written 400 B. C., mentions\r\nthat the inhabitants of Armenia used fermented drinks made from barley.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF AN OLD EGYPTIAN BREWERY,\r\n\r\n_As described by Manathos (third century B. C.), High Priest in\r\nHeliopolis_]\r\n\r\nThe Romans had their _cerevisia_ (beer) but with them it was a special\r\nluxury. Julius Cæsar was a noted admirer of it, and Plutarch, 50 A. D.,\r\nand Suetonius, each of whom wrote of Cæsar, tell us that after he had\r\ncrossed the Rubicon, 49 B. C., he gave a great feast to his leaders at\r\nwhich the principal beverage used was _cerevisia_, and the biographers\r\nof Lucullus tell us that at his magnificent entertainments beer was\r\nserved to his guests in golden goblets of the most costly device.\r\nAnd at that time also the Romans were already accustomed to sing\r\n_Cerevisiam bibunt homines, cœtera animalia fontes_.\r\n\r\nIn Germany beer was known about the same time, and Tacitus (54 A.\r\nD.,) says, that the Roman general Varius, who was sent by Augustus to\r\nconquer the country and subdue the inhabitants, but was defeated by\r\nArminius the leader of the Teutons, attributed the desperate valor of\r\nthe enemy and their complete success, in great measure to their free\r\nuse of _bior_ (beer).\r\n\r\nThe Allemanni, a large German tribe who were first mentioned by Dion\r\nCassius, 213 A.D., and who occupied the country between the river Main\r\nand the Danube, were formidable enemies both to the Romans and the\r\nGauls. They attached great importance to their beer which was brewed\r\nunder the supervision of the priests, and before use was blessed with\r\nmany solemn rites. In an old code of theirs we find that every member\r\nof a church (_Gotteshaus_) had to contribute for its maintenance\r\nfifteen _seidel_ of beer or some equivalent. The Emperor Julian who\r\ndefeated them in the year 357 A. D., near Strasburg, where all their\r\nforces were assembled under seven chiefs, found on the field of battle\r\nnumerous utensils designed to be employed in brewing.\r\n\r\nThe old Saxons in the seventh and eighth centuries when sitting in\r\ncouncil to consider questions of high importance would only deliberate\r\nafter drinking beer, which they took in common out of large _Humpen_\r\n(stone mugs).\r\n\r\nCharlemagne (742-814 A. D.,) himself gave directions how to brew the\r\nbeer for his court, and was as careful in selecting his brew-masters\r\nas in choosing his councilors and leaders. A single circumstance,\r\nattendant on his defeat of the Saxons at Paderborn, 777 A. D.,\r\nillustrates the high respect in which brewing was then held, and in\r\nthis particular, is suggestive of its semi-sacred character among the\r\nAllemanni as mentioned above. On that occasion it is related that the\r\nEmperor, surrounded by his chief leaders and councilors and by the\r\nambassadors of distant nations, received the homage of the heathen\r\nSaxon warriors, caused many thousands of them to be baptized and then\r\ncelebrated the double triumph of his arms and the Christian faith at\r\na great feast, at which there were seated with him Eginhard, Paul\r\nWarnefried and Alcuin, the Emperor’s friends and advisers, and all\r\ndrank of beer brewed by Charlemagne himself, while they discussed the\r\ngreat events that had just occurred. The drinking vessels were large\r\nmugs of a peculiar form which are still to be seen among a collection\r\nof relics presented to the Emperor by eastern potentates and now kept\r\nin a tower at the west end of the Cathedral of Aix-la-Chapelle, and\r\nexposed to public view once in every seven years. Within a few years\r\nnumerous relics have been found in the vicinity of Paderborn which\r\nindicate that beer brewing must have been as common and necessary in\r\nboth parties as the cooking of food.\r\n\r\nThe old Danes as far back as 860 A. D. under Gorm the Old, 936 A.\r\nD. under Harold Bluetooth, and 985 A. D. under Swend Twybeard, were\r\nacquainted with the art of brewing, and their old codes mention it as a\r\nmost honorable occupation.\r\n\r\nIn Bohemia, breweries were built at Budweis in the year 1256 A. D. by\r\ndirection of Ottokar II., King of Bohemia, and few cities in the world\r\ncan point to an establishment of such antiquity. Budweis beer is now\r\nalmost universally known and approved, though it is needless to say\r\nthat it differs materially from that made six hundred years ago.\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth century we see by an old law of France, in the reign\r\nof Louis IX., of the year 1268, how highly beer was esteemed and that\r\nlaws were already made to secure the purity of beer as well as to\r\nprotect the brewers in their avocation, and for curiosity’s sake we\r\ngive our readers an extract of those laws as mentioned above:\r\n\r\n1. No one shall brew beer or remove it in drays or otherwise, on\r\nSundays or on the solemn feasts of the Holy Virgin.\r\n\r\n2. No one shall set up in the brewery who has not served a five years’\r\napprenticeship, and been three years a partner with a regular brewer.\r\n\r\n3. Nothing shall enter into the composition of beer, but good malt\r\nand hops, well gathered, picked, and cured, without any mixture of\r\nbuckwheat, darnel, etc., and the hops shall be inspected by juries,\r\nto see that they are not used after being heated, moldy, damp, or\r\notherwise damaged.\r\n\r\n4. No beer yeast shall be hawked about the streets, but shall be all\r\nsold in the brew-houses to bakers and pastrycooks, and to no others.\r\n\r\n5. Beer yeast brought by foreigners shall be inspected by a jury before\r\nit is exposed to sale.\r\n\r\nC. No brewer shall keep in, or about, his brew-house any cows, oxen,\r\nhogs, geese, ducks, or poultry, as being inconsistent with cleanliness.\r\n\r\n7. There shall not be made in any brew-house more than one brewing of\r\nfifteen septiers at the most, of ground malt in a day.\r\n\r\n8. Casks, barrels, and other vessels made to hold beer, shall be marked\r\nwith the brewer’s mark, in the presence of a jury.\r\n\r\n9. No brewer shall take away from a house he serves with beer any\r\nvessels which do not belong to him.\r\n\r\n10. Those who sell beer by retail shall be subject to the inspection of\r\njuries.\r\n\r\n11. No one shall be a partner but with a master brewer.\r\n\r\n12. No master brewer shall have more than one apprentice at a time,\r\nwhich apprentice shall not be turned over without the consent of a jury.\r\n\r\n13. No one shall take a partner who has quitted his master without the\r\nconsent of such master.\r\n\r\n14. A widow may employ servants in brewing, but may not take an\r\napprentice.\r\n\r\n15. Master brewers shall not entice away one another’s apprentices nor\r\nservants.\r\n\r\n16. There shall be three masters elected for jurymen, two of which\r\nshall be changed every two years.\r\n\r\n17. Such jurymen shall have the power to inspect in the city and\r\nsuburbs.\r\n\r\nIn addition every brewer had to pay duty, so that the king might\r\nnot be defrauded, was obliged to give notice of every brewing to a\r\ncommissioner, stating the day and hour he intended to kindle the fire\r\nof his boiler, under a penalty of fine and confiscation. As brewing\r\nnecessitates the employment of a large quantity of grain, it was\r\ncustomary, in times of scarcity, for the king to put a stop to the\r\nmanufacture of beer for a certain number of weeks. These rules and\r\nregulations, made more than six hundred years since, are interesting\r\nand curious to the brewers of to-day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JACOB VAN ARTEVELDE,\r\n\r\n  “Brewer of Ghent,” Patrician, Orator and Ruler of the Province of\r\n  Flanders.

Bohemian beer is to be\r\nranked with the very best known, and an idea of the annual product for\r\nhome and foreign consumption may be formed from the fact that there are\r\nnow no less than eight hundred and eighty-seven breweries in actual\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nIn Austria, the first brewery built at Vienna was on the Weidenstrasse\r\nand dates back as far as 1384. The oldest standing brewery in the same\r\nplace is the St. Marx Brew-house, founded in 1706.\r\n\r\nIn the Provinces of Flanders and Brabant a beer brewed of malt and\r\nhops was the national beverage as early as the fourteenth century, and\r\nbrewers occupied an important position and were held in high esteem.\r\nHistory tells us that one of them, _Jacob Van Artevelde_ the Brewer\r\nof Ghent, a nobleman by birth, became a celebrated popular leader who\r\ndrove Louis I., Count of Flanders, into France, held the government of\r\nthe province and supported Edward III. of England until his death, July\r\n17, 1345.\r\n\r\nHis son Philip, who at one time was chosen ruler of the provinces and\r\nwho died 1382, was as well known as a celebrated brewer as his father.\r\n\r\nTo Flanders also belongs the celebrated Gambrinus, who under his real\r\nname of Jan Primus, Duke of Flanders, ruled Flanders and Brabant\r\nwisely, and became the protector of the beer brewing fraternity. Under\r\nthe popular cognomen, however, (to which many mythical attributes have\r\nbeen attached) he is universally known, and perhaps held in higher\r\nesteem by a greater number of adherents than all the saints, even\r\nincluding Saint Patrick, who have been canonized up to the present day.\r\n\r\nIn England beer was introduced by the Romans. The Saxons found it there\r\nand improved wonderfully upon the discovery. For centuries it received,\r\nin the modern literature of England, the constant attention and\r\nconsideration of churchmen, historians, poets and political economists.\r\nThe churchmen especially were active in the improvement of malt\r\nliquors. William of Malmsbury says that the best brewers in England at\r\nthe time of Henry II. were to be found in the monasteries, and every\r\nreader of early English literature remembers frequent allusions not\r\nonly to beer in general but to that of the holy fathers in particular.\r\nThe monks were the first to discover the peculiar fitness of the waters\r\nof Burton on Trent for brewing purposes, and may thus be said to have\r\npaved the way for the development of the enormous establishments that\r\nnow scatter their product over all the world.\r\n\r\nAccording to “Tennant’s Guide to London,” published at the beginning\r\nof the present century, there were in the reigns of the Tudors great\r\nbreweries at London, situated on the river-side below St. Katherine’s.\r\nIn 1492 King Henry VII. licensed a Flemish brewer, John Merchant,\r\nto export a large quantity of the so-called “berre,” and that the\r\nbeer had to be of good quality and was under the surveillance of the\r\nauthorities, is proved by the fact that Geffrey Gate, an officer of the\r\nking, twice destroyed the brew-houses on account of the weakness of the\r\nbeer.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Elizabeth the demand for ale increased very largely,\r\nand we find mention of an export of five hundred tuns of the precious\r\nliquor at one time. This was sent to Amsterdam for the use of the\r\nthirsty army in the Netherlands. Mary Queen of Scots in the midst\r\nof her troubles seems not to have been altogether insensible to the\r\nattractions of English beer, for when she was confined in Tutbury\r\nCastle, Walsingham, her secretary asked “At what place near Tutbury\r\nbeer may be provided for her majestie’s use?” To which Sir Ralph\r\nSadler, governor of the castle made reply, “Beer may be had at Burton,\r\nthree miles off.” This Burton on Trent began to be famous for its\r\nwater in the thirteenth century. There is a document still extant,\r\ndated 1295, in which it is stated that Matilda, daughter of Nicholas\r\nShoben had released to the abbot and convent of Burton on Trent certain\r\ntenements, for which release they granted her daily for life two white\r\nloaves from the monastery, two gallons of conventual beer and one\r\npenny, besides seven gallons of beer for the men.\r\n\r\nIn the fifteenth century the monks in Germany brewed two kinds of beer\r\nin the convents, one kind for the _Patres_, and an inferior beer for\r\nthe convents.\r\n\r\nIn the sixteenth century the breweries in Germany were already\r\ncelebrated for their malt beer.\r\n\r\nCities not having good cellars, on account of which good beer could\r\nnot be produced, were provided with the beverage through their city\r\nfathers from other places, stored and sold in the cellars of the city\r\nhall, hence the origin of the name Rathskeller. The most celebrated\r\nbeer at that time, was the Braunschweiger Mumme, and the beer of\r\nEimbeck, Merseburg and Bamberg. Beer before it could be sold had\r\nto pass a strict examination by a committee consisting of brewers\r\nof the greatest reputation, appointed by the burgomaster under and\r\nby advice of the city fathers; and a “Brauherr,” (proprietor and\r\nbrew-master of a brewery) was a man of importance. In the principality\r\nof Brandenburg—afterwards the kingdom of Prussia—it was thought as\r\nearly as the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries that beer was the\r\nmost wholesome of all beverages, and the electors of Brandenburg, later\r\nthe kings of Prussia, fostered breweries by the concession of numerous\r\nprivileges which were increased from time to time. Grants of this\r\ncharacter and of no small advantage were held by brewers in Cottbus,[1]\r\nProvince of Brandenburg, and were considerably enlarged by Frederick\r\nthe Great in favor of Huguenots who had at his invitation settled in\r\nthe kingdom after being forced by the revocation of the edict of Nantes\r\nto leave France. These privileges, enjoyed by the Toussaints, Salems\r\nand others for many years, were abolished by the declaration of the\r\nfreedom of trade in 1838.\r\n\r\n[1] Celebrated for the famous white beer which was at that time largely\r\nexported to Upper Silesia, Bohemia, Berlin, Hamburg, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MYNHER JACOBUS,\r\n\r\nBrewer and First Burgomaster of New Amsterdam (the present New York),\r\n1644.]\r\n\r\nAfter the year 1721 coffee began to be extensively used, and at last\r\nFrederick the Great in order to check its introduction erected large\r\ncoffee roasting establishments which had a monopoly of the business,\r\nand where the coffee was sold at an enormous price, only the nobility,\r\nhaving the right of roasting their coffee beans. “Coffee smellers” or\r\nspies were appointed to look out for evaders of the law, just as we\r\nhave now beer and whisky smellers. On the 13th day of September, 1777,\r\nthe great king issued his celebrated “coffee and beer manifesto.” It\r\nwas particularly addressed to the provincial members (_Landstande_)\r\nof the provinces of Pommerania and Brandenburg, which were called\r\nthe nurseries of his armies, and read as follows: “It is disgusting\r\nto notice the increase in the quantity of coffee used by my subjects\r\nand the amount of money that goes out of the country in consequence.\r\nEverybody is using coffee. If possible this must be prevented. My\r\npeople must drink beer. His majesty was brought up on beer and so\r\nwere his ancestors and his officers and soldiers. Many battles have\r\nbeen fought and won by soldiers nourished on beer, and the king does\r\nnot believe that coffee-drinking soldiers can be depended on to\r\nendure hardship or to beat his enemies in case of the occurrence of\r\nanother war.” This proclamation had the desired effect, and coffee was\r\nthenceforth used merely as a luxury, while beer became the usual drink\r\nof the people.\r\n\r\nIn the United States the pioneers in the brewing business were William\r\nPenn and Jacobus, a Dutch brewer of whom Irving tells us that he\r\nleft the States General of Holland to settle on Manhattan Island in\r\ncompany with Hendricks, the Kips and others. It will be remembered\r\nthat Manhattan Island was discovered by Hendrik Hudson in 1609 when he\r\npassed inside Sandy Hook in search of a northwest passage, and that it\r\nwas granted by charter of the States General to the West India Company\r\nto colonize the island. The company was not slow to discover the\r\nadvantages of such a concession and immediately set at work to build\r\nforts, a church, a mill and a bakery while Jacobus, who thoroughly\r\nunderstood the good effects of beer and the benefits that would follow\r\nits introduction in the colony, established a brewery (in 1644) and a\r\nbeer garden on what is now the corner of Pearl street and Old Slip. He\r\nafterwards became the first burgomaster and is said to have dispensed\r\nbeer and justice with equal gravity and impartiality, and to the\r\ncomplete satisfaction of the inhabitants of new Amsterdam.\r\n\r\nIt may be interesting to some readers to know that while Jacobus\r\nsettled near the lower end of the present city the Kips were\r\nestablished in the neighborhood of Bellevue Heights, and that on a part\r\nof that settlement—in East 38th street—stands now the well known and\r\njustly esteemed lager beer brewery of A. Huepfel’s Sons.\r\n\r\nSomewhat later the same business was undertaken by Israel and Timothy\r\nHorsfield, who came from England, one in 1706 and the other in 1720,\r\nand settled in Brooklyn, L. I. Their brewery was near the ferry in what\r\nis now Wallabout.\r\n\r\nWilliam Penn, 1644-1718, a man of Dutch extraction on his mother’s\r\nside, founder of Pennsylvania and the leading spirit of its\r\nsettlement—so justly celebrated for his virtues—brewed and sold beer at\r\nPennsbury, Bucks County, Pa.\r\n\r\nGood Quaker as Penn was, he was no ascetic. He was a great lover\r\nof beer, and accustomed to praise his own brewing—he was not\r\naverse to society, in his house was no lack of comfort, his table\r\nwas well provided, and his taste for good living could never be\r\nimpeached—dancing did not shock him, for both he and his family\r\npatronized country dances and country fairs, and William Penn’s beer\r\nwas the beverage used on such occasions.\r\n\r\nUnder his proprietary laws he allowed beer to be sold free of license,\r\nand this sensible enactment was continued under the state laws until\r\nthe year 1847, when a ten dollar license was substituted. Such a\r\ntax certainly compares favorably with that of many other states and\r\ndisplays a moderation and reasonableness that does credit to the Quaker\r\ncommunity and is in strong contrast to the spirit recently exhibited in\r\nsome parts of the country.\r\n\r\nAnother celebrated promoter of early beer brewing in America was Gen.\r\nIsrael Putnam, known to every child as the hero of the wolf’s den and\r\nthe desperate ride down the rocks, and to an older generation as a\r\nbrave soldier and marked character, the man who “dared to lead where\r\nany dared to follow,” and who has gained a higher position in history\r\nby virtue of his personal qualities and a touch of romance that clings\r\nto his name than might strictly attach to his military services.\r\n\r\nAlthough generally known as a Connecticut man he was born at Salem,\r\nMass., 1718, and in 1739, at the age of twenty-one, removed to Pomfret,\r\nConn., and later to Brooklyn in the same state, with which latter place\r\nhis name is afterwards associated. Here as a farmer and tavern keeper\r\nhe passed the remainder of his life except that considerable part which\r\nwas given to the active military service of his country. The change\r\nfrom the life of a successful soldier to these commonplace pursuits\r\nwould seem to many to be near akin to a fall, but Putnam’s practical\r\ngood sense found no difficulty in it. When he returned from the army\r\nhe resumed his farming, tavern business and beer brewing, and seems\r\nto have had no false shame at either of the humbler avocations. Like\r\na wise and self-contained man he did the work nearest to his hand and\r\nfound honor in it whatever it might be. On the other hand, however, it\r\nis no small credit to the beer brewing fraternity to have had such a\r\nman in their ranks, even were it in a more limited and incidental way\r\nthan was actually the case. The tavern sign of General Israel Putnam,\r\nwhich hung before his door in Brooklyn, (Conn.,) in the year 1768 and\r\nlater, is now preserved in the rooms of the Historical Society at\r\nHartford, (Conn.,) and an illustration representing it will be found on\r\nthe opposite page.\r\n\r\nThe sign is made of yellow pine, painted alike on both sides. The\r\ndevice is a full length portrait of General Wolfe, dressed in scarlet\r\nuniform. The portrait of the young hero is quite correct.\r\n\r\nThe sign was presented to the Historical Society by Rufus S. Mathewson\r\nof Woodstock.\r\n\r\nAside from the early public breweries there were doubtless many in\r\nwhich beer was made for family consumption. “Home brewed” was common in\r\nthe native homes of most of the colonists, and there is no reason to\r\nsuppose that they voluntarily changed their accustomed manner of living\r\nand dispensed with a wholesome drink to which they had been used from\r\ninfancy.\r\n\r\nIn leaving this branch of the subject it should be noted that the beer\r\nof the earliest periods, like the ale of England before the seventeenth\r\ncentury, was usually made without hops, and it is impossible to say\r\nwhen these were first employed, although the experiment was certainly\r\nof no very modern date. It was probably the greatest improvement ever\r\nmade in the production of beer, since it gives a light, clear, and\r\nelegant product very different from anything that was produced on the\r\nother plan. The modern demand was for a drink that should be agreeable,\r\nrefreshing and moderately stimulating, and it is now abundantly\r\nrecognized that the fermented decoction of malted barley, clarified and\r\npreserved by the hops, best fulfills this requirement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gen^l WOLFE.\r\n\r\nSIGN OF GENERAL PUTNAM’S TAVERN IN BROOKLYN, CONN.\r\n\r\n_The original is now in the Rooms of the Historical Society, at\r\nHartford. Conn._]\r\n\r\nBeer has been considered a necessity in all generations, and only in\r\nthis, the nineteenth century, have extremists arisen to condemn its\r\nuse. It is worthy of note that its greatest enemies are among a class\r\nwho, in the olden times, were its greatest friends. The old abbeys and\r\nmonasteries were the places where the best malt liquor was brewed; and\r\nnot least among the benefactors of their species were the Franciscans\r\nand Dominicans, who brewed good beer to cheer the hearts of toiling\r\nhumanity. Bishops have written in its praise; universities have\r\nencouraged its production; and kings having the comfort and contentment\r\nof their subjects in view have cared for its proper provision. Under\r\ndate January 27, 1617, it is noted in “Langbaine’s Collections” that\r\none John Shurle had a patent from Abraham Lake, Bishop of Bath and\r\nWells and Vice Chancellor of Oxford, for the office of Ale-taster to\r\nthe university. “The office of Ale-tasting requires that he go to every\r\nale-brewer that day they brew, according to their courses, and taste\r\ntheir ale; for which his ancient fee is one gallon of strong ale and\r\ntwo gallons of strong wort.”\r\n\r\nSuch a fact is enough to make the modern teetotal dominies stand\r\naghast, but it may well be doubted if they are better or wiser men than\r\ntheir predecessors, one of whose distinguishing characteristics was\r\nusually a sound common sense in the ordinary affairs of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n                  EARLY HISTORY OF BEER—CONTINUED.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the close of the preceding chapter we had intended to leave this\r\nbranch of the subject, but a paper of Hans von der Planitz, written\r\nin German on the same topic, is so interesting that we cannot do\r\nbetter than quote a considerable portion. It is written with genuine\r\nenthusiasm and is valuable not merely for its facts regarding the early\r\nhistory of beer, but also as a picture of customs and manners, often\r\ngiven in the words of writers contemporary with the circumstances\r\ndescribed. The picturesque or realistic effect of the old German\r\nhas been as far as possible preserved in the rendering of passages\r\nwritten in that style, and very often the original is added in a note\r\nor otherwise, for the enjoyment of readers who are able to appreciate\r\nits flavor. Quotation at such length has involved a trifling amount of\r\nrepetition of matter already stated, but it has seemed better to submit\r\nto this than to mutilate an independent account, much of whose effect\r\ndepends on its manner of developing the subject. Commencing with the\r\nninth century the writer says:\r\n\r\n“Beer brewing in England and Flanders is mentioned by Walafried\r\nStrabo. (849 A. D.) It had been known from a remote antiquity and\r\ncontinued in use partly, at least, through Celtic influence. In France\r\nbeer gradually gave place to wine, while in Germany it made good its\r\nposition, and lager beer was discovered as early as the thirteenth\r\ncentury, that of the Mark being especially celebrated. In Bohemia the\r\nearliest account of beer brewing dates as far back as 1086 A. D. Poland\r\nand Prussia were addicted to the barley juice before the time of modern\r\ncivilization and honored a special god of beer, _Raugunzemapat_, whose\r\nname is derived from _rugti_, to ferment, and literally signifies\r\nthe god of fermentation. In Bavaria, where, under Roman influence,\r\nwine growing had attained an important place which it was destined\r\nafterwards to lose, beer was commonly known within the first thousand\r\nyears of the present era and is mentioned by Voehrung, 816, and\r\nothers. According to Graesse it was a dull brown and reddish drink and\r\nsoured easily. In the more primitive districts oats were used as the\r\nbasis, and only “upper-ferment” beer was made. In the latter part of\r\nthe middle ages the process by “under fermentation” was discovered,\r\nits origin, according to Professor Holzner of Weihenstephan, being\r\nin one of the monasteries. From this point beer brewing increased\r\nvigorously until Bohemian competition and Bohemian hops gave it a\r\nstaggering check. In the southern countries of Europe beer does not\r\neasily give place to wine though hard pushed, while in Asia and Africa\r\nthe inhabitants use their traditionary drink from one generation to\r\nanother, and in Egypt especially, the Arabs acquired a taste for the\r\nbeer of the Copts. Such was the condition of things when the dawn of a\r\nnew age showed itself on the horizon.\r\n\r\n“The characteristic of a period is found essentially in its variation\r\nfrom the adjacent epochs, and that of the one under consideration has\r\nbeen already indicated. But beside the scientific researches, that\r\nhad very little connection with trade, there grew up a descriptive\r\nliterature that stands in close relation to the first general empire\r\nof beer. To suppose that the present age is the first time of real\r\ntriumph for the liquor of Gambrinus, shows a very superficial knowledge\r\nof the history of civilization, for apart from the Egyptian and\r\nCeltic-Germanic beer epochs, which were somewhat local, we have already\r\nlong passed the real first period of success which fell in the time of\r\nthe _Renaissance_. In those days the brown flood spread out not merely\r\nover Germany, England and Belgium, but into the far corners of recently\r\ndiscovered countries; in village taverns and _rathskellers_ peasants\r\nand citizens drank themselves full and merry. At the high schools the\r\nstudents already went to the _kneipen_ with their rapiers (_spiessen_)\r\nand swords, studied and rioted behind the tin can, and in the banquet\r\nhalls of princes and the cabinets of noble ladies, the barley juice\r\nwas a favorite beverage, not swallowed hastily from tumblers, but\r\ntaken with deliberation and full enjoyment from deep, wide-mouthed\r\nmugs or tankards. Seven maas a day was the allowance for a lady of\r\nhigh rank.[2] About the end of the seventeenth century the increasing\r\nuse of brandy and coffee put a stop to this immoderate consumption,\r\nas at the same time the influence of France and the colonies with\r\ntheir new dishes and resulting change of tastes, brought about the\r\nprogress from middle age cookery to that of modern times, and as the\r\nGustavus Adolphus boots and wide-brimmed plumed hats gave place to silk\r\nstockings and perukes. The present age witnesses the second triumph of\r\nGambrinus, a triumph perhaps even greater than the first, for though\r\nthe capacity of individuals is far from equal to that of the men of\r\nthe Renaissance, except in the case of some academic beer soakers and\r\nMunich _Danaidenfaesser_ (bottomless vessels), yet the distribution of\r\nbeer is more extensive, more general and more uniform. The consumption\r\nin Europe alone has increased tenfold within fifty years and grows\r\nconstantly. In the first quarter of this century the wave spread from\r\nBavaria farther and farther over the whole map of Europe, and about\r\ntwenty years ago a new source was opened in Austria, and the Vienna\r\nbeer flowed through the canals which the Bavarian product had opened.\r\n\r\n[2] Sieben Maas Bier per Tag vors graefliche Frauenzimmer war\r\nVorschrift.\r\n\r\nThis first epoch stands in close relation with the general abounding\r\nstrength of that period of civilization. Adventurous sailors and\r\nexplorers had broken the bonds of the known earth, plain men had dared\r\nto enter the lists with that hierarchy, to attack which had been held\r\nprofanation; art had thrown aside the old traditions and brought out\r\nthe old master-works, the world of scholars had torn itself loose\r\nfrom petrified scholasticism and turned to the ancient classics,\r\nand, as in most branches of science, so also in chemistry, there was\r\na genuine revolution, and it was studied in reference to medicine\r\nalmost as assiduously as it had previously been in the search for the\r\nphilosopher’s stone. New inquiries were set on foot, old problems\r\nrevived and attacked from a new point of view, and among these the\r\nsubjects of yeast and fermentation played an important part. Not\r\nmany decades have passed since the practical brewer found neither\r\ninterest nor profit in theories of fermentation, and especially all\r\nchemical and physical discussion of his work and processes. The\r\npurely scientific style which too often had very little reference to\r\nthe practical man, and the various contradictory views and learned\r\ncontroversies were not calculated to attract the interest of the beer\r\nbrewer. Scholars discussed and disputed, the man of trade brewed and\r\ncoopered, and neither paid any attention to the other. Now the case is\r\nvery different. Intelligent and thoughtful brewers have been forced to\r\nadmit that an insight into the nature of the materials they use, and\r\nthe changes these undergo while in their hands will not merely enlarge\r\ntheir intellectual horizon, but be of great practical use in their\r\nbusiness, and in consequence are found keenly alive to the progress of\r\nscientific inquiry.\r\n\r\nSome reference has already been made to the empirical knowledge of the\r\nearlier ages. Even Pliny’s often quoted “_Palam est naturam (farinæ)\r\nacore fermentari_” is merely a summary of the result of observation.\r\nNoah’s wine making, the leaven[3] of the Jews and such like may be left\r\nto special history. The word _fermentum_ as used by the alchemists\r\nhas no very definite meaning; in general their explanation is to the\r\neffect that by means of the ferment a purifying and refining process\r\nis set in action—and hence many efforts were made to discover a\r\ngeneral ferment by whose instrumentality it would become possible\r\namong other things, to transform the baser metals into gold. For this\r\nreason they often use the word _fermentum_ to indicate the anxiously\r\nsought “philosopher’s stone.”[4] The indefinite character of the word\r\nis mentioned by Petrus Bonus of Ferrara (1345): “_Apud philosophos\r\nfermentum dupliciter videtur dici: uno modo ipse lapis philosophorum\r\nex suis elementis compositus et completus, in comparatione ad metalla;\r\nalio modo illud quod est perficiens lapidem et ipsum complens_,” and\r\nRaymond Lull’s definition, “_Fili, fermentum est corpus perfectum,\r\nsubtiliatum et alteratum per potestatem convertentium_,” has the\r\npredicate so indefinite as to give no real information. We add another\r\nquotation from the same author merely to show further the jargon these\r\nmen of learning were accustomed to use. He writes “_Fili, præparatio\r\nistius est, quod illud sit transactum primo per naturæ principalia\r\ncontrovertentia, antequam de isto facias fermentationem, quia illud\r\nfiat principio pulvis calcinatus per coagulationem et quarto sublimatus\r\nper separationem._” George Ripley’s consideration of the subject\r\ncalls for no special notice, but the views of Basilius Valentinus\r\nwho wrote in the latter half of the fifteenth century will be found\r\nmore interesting. He held fermentation to be a purification by means\r\nof which the spirit of wine that already existed in a fluid was put\r\nin condition to act, unfermented beer being dead, “because existing\r\nimpurities prevent the spirit from doing its work. Yeast induces in\r\nbeer an internal quickening that advances of itself and results in a\r\ndivision and segregation of the clear and muddy elements, and after\r\nthis separation _puri ab impuro_ the spirit can accomplish its duty\r\nsuccessfully, as appears from the subsequent power of the liquor to\r\nproduce intoxication.” Valentine is the last in the series of scholars\r\nwho though belonging chronologically to a previous epoch must from\r\nthe nature and relations of their inquiries be reckoned as belonging\r\nto the new era. It is not in the history of progress as in that of\r\npolitics where two adjacent periods can be sharply defined and their\r\nlimits assigned to exact dates. Progress goes on gradually, modifying\r\nor adding to what has already existed, and we do not clearly notice\r\nthe transformation until it is complete or at least far advanced. So\r\nit was in this case. Far back in the middle ages men turned their\r\nattention to the “ferment” and to fermentation. Much was written, much\r\nnonsense and humbug published; almost no results were attained, but\r\nthe beginning was made. Men of the later time grasped the collected\r\nmaterial, regulated and systematized the inquiry and vied with each\r\nother in its prosecution. Struggle and activity were then so universal\r\nthat there was a disposition to consider fermentation a special branch\r\nof chemistry, and after treating of the fermentation of wine, beer,\r\nvinegar, etc., it was suggested that the whole vital process might be\r\nnothing more than a continual fermentation.\r\n\r\n[3] _Galliæ et Hispaniæ frumento in potum resoluto spuma ita concreta\r\npro fermento utuntur; qua de causa levior illis quam ceteris panis est._\r\n\r\n[4] _De fermento, sine quo ars alchemiæ perfeci et compleri non potest._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: View of a Brewery connected with a convent in Bohemia\r\n(14th century), as described by Thaddeus Hagecius ab Hayek, 1585, in\r\nhis book, written in Latin, under the title, _De cerevisia_.]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all that has been said it seems best to date the new\r\nepoch definitely from the beginning of the sixteenth century, and this\r\nalthough we can reckon no names or events of importance in the year\r\n1501, and must pass over a number of decades to reach Libarius the\r\nfirst theorist of the second epoch. The reasons for such a division\r\nare various, partly to remove as far as possible all uncertainty from\r\nthe discussion, partly because at that memorable time the general\r\nbreak with blind tradition and the development of new intellectual\r\nand social conditions took place in such a manner as to have a direct\r\ninfluence on the history of beer and so connect the general revolution\r\nwith the province of zymotechnic inquiry. If we date from Libarius we\r\ncommit an anachronism, for he stands in the full light of the new era.\r\nIn short, beer and its history are so intimately related to social\r\nlife and its development that we cannot consider the former alone\r\nand without regard to the latter. The oldest book in this sort of\r\nliterature at present known, was published in 1530, under the title,\r\n“An Excellent Little Book of the Making of Wine and Beer so that they\r\nmay be Useful and Wholesome to Man. Printed at Erfurt by Melchior\r\nSachssen at Noah’s Ark.”[5] In 1551, a scholar (Plocotamus) wrote “_De\r\nnatura cerevisiarum et de mulso_,” and somewhat later (1585) Thaddeus\r\nHagecius ab Hayek wrote in Latin a work with the title “_De cerevisia\r\nejusque conficiendi ratione, natura, viribus et facultatibus_.” More\r\nimportant than any of these is a book written in German by Heinrich\r\nKnaust, its value consisting not so much in historical deductions as\r\nin a review, grounded on the personal knowledge of the author, of the\r\nfacts regarding beer in his time. It is chiefly through this volume\r\nthat we are able to form a clear conception of the high development and\r\nactual power of beer at the end of the sixteenth century. On the first\r\npage of the book the master wrote in a style thoroughly characteristic\r\nof the period with its swelling, stilted bombast and magniloquence,\r\nthe famous title, “Five Books of the Divine and Noble Gift of the\r\nPhilosophical, Precious and Admirable Art of Beer Brewing. Also of the\r\nnames of the most Admirable Beers in all Germany, and of their Natures,\r\nTemperaments, Qualities, Individual Characters, Wholesomeness, and\r\nUnwholesomeness, whether wheat or barley, white or red beer, spiced\r\nor not spiced. Newly revised and much Fuller and More Perfect than\r\nthe former edition. By Master Heinrich Knaust, Doctor of Law and of\r\nMedicine. Published at Erfurt by George Baumann, 1575, in the twelfth\r\nmonth.”[6] As a matter of curiosity we reproduce his view of the origin\r\nof beer. According to this the men before the deluge ate herbs and\r\nvegetables and drank water, and he thinks it strange that they should\r\never have plucked up heart to become saucy on such a diet. “After the\r\ndeluge they received the gift of wine, and where no vines grew God\r\ntaught them to make a drink of wheat and barley that was both healthful\r\nand agreeable and as well fitted to strengthen and support the human\r\nsystem as wine itself.”\r\n\r\n[5] Ein schoenes Buechlein von bereytung der wein und bier zu\r\ngesundheit und nutzbarkeit der menschen gedruckt zu Erffurd durch\r\nMelchior Sachssen zu der Archen Noe.\r\n\r\n[6] Fuenf Buecher von der goettlichen und edeln Gabe der\r\nphilosophischen hochteuren und wunderbaren Kunst Bier zu brauen.

Santa\r\nClara of Vienna who, in his “History of the Discovery of Beer,”\r\nentitled “Something for All,” 1710, spoke as follows: “Noah planted\r\nthe first vineyard and the culture of the vine afterwards spread all\r\nover the world, but as some climates are too harsh for the grape and\r\nprevent its ripening, human ingenuity was forced to discover another\r\ndrink which should not merely quench thirst, but like wine excite the\r\nbrain.[7] Among the Germans it is called beer, and its brewing requires\r\na special experience, so that the men of this craft are not counted\r\nleast among workmen.” So said also Ehinger, Fritsch, Germershausen,\r\nGleditsch, Heuman, Hofman, Sensky, Solms and Trafenreuter. In all\r\nthis scientific and learned emulation in the matter of fermentation\r\n(zymologie) we learn plainly enough that even the representatives\r\nof science did not confine their attention to a purely theoretical\r\nconsideration of the barley juice, but hid the contents of many a can\r\nand mug behind their wide stiff collars, the clergy taking their full\r\nshare in this part of the discussion. Luther’s fondness for beer is\r\nwell known, and on the evening of that eventful day at Worms, April\r\n18, 1521, the Duke Erich von Braunschweig, sent him a pot of Eimbecker\r\nbeer, to which he was specially addicted. The students, whether of\r\nmedicine or theology, used every effort to follow faithfully the\r\nillustrious example, whence perhaps it comes that the youth of the\r\nhigh schools and universities, wedded to tradition, still delight to\r\nhang about the inviting, wide-yawning door of the cool beer cellar.\r\nIn the Renaissance, however, the last trace of the _Biercomment_ and\r\n_Bierspielen_ was finally lost.\r\n\r\n[7] Der Noë hat zwar den ersten Weinstock gepflantzt welches Gewuechs\r\nnachmals durch die ganze Welt ausgebreitet worden; weil aber etlicher\r\nOrten der rauhe Luft dem Weinstock zuwider und folgsam, solcher in\r\ndergleichen Orten nicht fruchtsam tuht, also hat der Menschen Witz ein\r\nanderes Trunk erfunden welches nicht allein den Durst loeschet sondern\r\ngleich dem Wein, auch den Tuermel in den Kopf bringt.\r\n\r\n  [8] The common people would not sober stay,\r\n      Could find to cup or mouth the nearest way;\r\n      Enjoyed their life, and of the barley’s blood\r\n      Swilled day and night the brown and foamy flood.\r\n\r\n[8]   Des Volks gemeine Horte blieb nicht hinten,\r\n      Es wusste Kneip’ und maul sehr wohl zu finden;\r\n      Im Hochgenuss des Seins, aus Schlauch und Fass\r\n      Soff’s Tag und nacht das edle braune Nass.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeer was retailed in beer-houses and vaults, and in warm weather before\r\nthe door, and places which had the hereditary right of brewing also\r\nsold beer occasionally in the living room of the house, and announced\r\nthe fact by a mat-weed stuck horizontally above the door. In this\r\ncustom we see plainly enough the origin of the later shop signs. In\r\nOberpfalz (the Upper Palatinate), in the Schwarzwald (Black Forest),\r\nand elsewhere, even now when a privileged brewer wishes to give notice\r\nthat he will sell on draught, he hangs up a broom or a triangle of fir\r\nboughs. The publicans of a later time simply exchange this primitive\r\nadvertisement for the more durable ones of tin and iron. Before the\r\nwindows of the pot houses were folding tables at which the wagoners\r\nusually preferred to drink, and the wandering bands, of whom there was\r\nthen an immense number, were accustomed to seat themselves at these\r\nsame tables and pass the time in riotous talk and games of dice until\r\nthe “beer bell” of the place broke up the assembly and drove them to\r\ntheir homes and to the inn.[9] When a fair was held the women dealers\r\nin refreshments (Kretschenweiber) took possession of the benches and\r\nsold their beer there in cups of tin, stone or wood, while bread, meat,\r\nsausages, cheese, etc., were brought from the neighboring stands of the\r\nbutchers and bakers, for even then people liked to do their business\r\nwhere wine and beer were close at hand. On any occasion of public\r\nfestivity beer booths were a prime necessity, bagpipes and fiddles\r\nwere not wanting and a lusty, merry throng danced in the open space\r\nbetween the crowded benches and tables. The Netherlandish painters have\r\nleft us hundreds of cabinet pictures of these festivities and of the\r\nmanner and fashion in which they were carried on, and their delightful\r\nand characteristic variations of the theme enable us to form a vivid\r\nconception of what it must have been. Especially worthy of notice in\r\nthis respect are Teniers, (whose “Yearly Market”[10] in the Munich\r\nPinakothek contains 1138 human figures, 45 horses, 67 asses, 37 dogs,\r\netc., curiously crowded in a jovial throng,) P. Brueghel, the Ostades,\r\nBrower, Jan Steen, who from a fancy for this sort of life himself\r\nbecame a tavern keeper, and Rubens, whose sketches in this sort are\r\nstrikingly good. During the “Thirty Years War,” that is, at the very\r\nculminating point of the epoch, tobacco came into use and the now\r\ninseparable pair, “beer and tobacco,” played an important rôle together\r\neven then. Barley and “mixed corn” (rye and wheat, barley and oats,\r\noats and rye,) were chiefly used for brewing purposes, but there were\r\nalways those who preferred plant beer. It is interesting to know that\r\npitch was supposed to give the product of fermentation a better keeping\r\nquality.\r\n\r\n[9] See the Civil Law of Erfurt.\r\n\r\n[10] The picture is eight feet high and twelve feet wide.\r\n\r\nWe must not omit to mention that this beer worship was not so well\r\ndeveloped in South Germany where it is now best marked, as in North\r\nGermany. Saxony, the Mark and Pomerania were mentioned as “the great\r\ndrinking countries.” There was a swarm of names celebrated in beer,\r\nand Knaust’s book shows that it was held no small credit to have drunk\r\nvarious noted kinds of beer where they were made. There was a Lubeck\r\nIsrael, an old Klaus (Brandenburg), a Goslauer Gose, a Hanover Braehan,\r\na Soltzman at Saltzwedel, a Rastrun at Leipsic, beer of Corvey, beer of\r\nHarlem, Dantzic brew, Eimbecker brew, and many others.[11] Of English\r\nbeer, Hersford (Kamma) and the Yorkshire ale were chiefly esteemed.\r\nMost celebrated of all, however, was the Braunschweig _Mumme_, named\r\nfor its discoverer, Christian Mumme (1492). By the side of these\r\nbrewing celebrities the old beer cities of the middle ages had retained\r\ntheir character into the time of the Renaissance, as for instance,\r\nHamburg, with its wheat beer,[12] and others; and many places made\r\nevery effort to reach a similar position, partly by the adoption of new\r\nmethods, and partly by the enlargement and increase of beer breweries.\r\nIn Nuremberg, for instance, the first white beer was brewed in 1541; in\r\nVienna the brewery with a hundred towers was built in 1564; breweries\r\nwere erected at Gumpendorf in 1689, and at St. Marx in 1706; and in\r\n1633 there were established at Freiburg six malt-houses and twelve\r\nbreweries.\r\n\r\n[11] To these should be added the celebrated beers of Cottbus, and the\r\nKarthuser of Frankfort on the Oder.—_Author._\r\n\r\n[12] Wheat beer played an important rôle in the thirty years war.\r\nWallenstein himself was very much addicted to its use.\r\n\r\nThe important beer privileges that had been so eagerly grasped by\r\nthe monasteries and cities in the middle ages, were by hereditary\r\nright brought over into the new era. The landed estates of the nobles\r\nreceived back in 1517 the privileges which had been so long kept\r\nfrom them, and by this means all obstacles were removed from the\r\nbeer traffic which had reached so hopeful a development during the\r\nmiddle ages, and it became possible for it to develop to an extent of\r\nwhich our own time need not be ashamed. Now it is no great matter to\r\ntransport beer from Vienna to Paris by rail and in iced compartments,\r\nbut we can not but admire the successful enterprise that in those\r\ndays and with such means of transportation as existed, could export\r\nEimbecker beer to Lombardy as described by the Italian Arnoldus of\r\nVillanova in 1594, and even to Alexandria and Cairo. Nuremberg was one\r\nof the great centers of the beer trade. Rostock and Lubeck supplied all\r\nEngland and sent not less than 800,000 barrels yearly to that country\r\nuntil the business was checked by a marked increase in the quantity\r\nbrewed by the English themselves. A number of the large English\r\nbreweries were founded about this time.\r\n\r\nIn the households of the reigning princes, there was a strong tendency\r\nto supplement the native brew by imported products, and at such\r\nfestivities as marriages, christenings, target-shooting and hunting,\r\nimmense quantities of drink were swallowed. The cellar ordinance of\r\nDuke Ernst the Pious, in 1648, allowed for ladies of noble rank four\r\n_maas_ of beer a day, and three _maas_ for a “nightcap.” How much ought\r\nin such circumstances to be the allowance for a man of similar rank,\r\nand of his hangers on is left to the imagination of the reader.\r\n\r\nNoble families that had no brew-houses were obliged to supply\r\nthemselves from the brewery of the prince. A beer tax also was levied\r\non vassals who brewed their own beer. An excellent illustration of\r\nthe condition of things is afforded by the celebrated Hofbrauhaus at\r\nMunich, in whose whitewashed rooms every stranger still takes at least\r\none _maas_. As early as the time of Louis the Severe, there existed a\r\nlittle court brewery at Munich near the _Burggasse_, but towards the\r\nend of the sixteenth century, the demand increasing and the facilities\r\nfor production having long been inadequate, William V. proceeded to\r\nthe building of the present brew-house, which was at first intended\r\nonly for the making of white beer, the brown being still made in the\r\nold quarters. In 1708, however, brown beer also began to be made in\r\nthe new establishment. This topic is treated in a stereotyped article\r\nwhich appears every year in the May number of the Munich Beer Gazette,\r\nunder the title “Bock article,” and gives the worshipful bock-drinking\r\ncommunity a solemn and moving account of the court brewery and its\r\nproducts down to the minutest particulars. As regards bock itself,\r\nwhich is no longer an exclusive specialty of Munich, as a drink under\r\nthe same name is sold every year in various cities, Graesse places\r\nits origin in the seventeenth century, and suggests that it was an\r\nimitation of the Eimbecker beer,—the last rather in virtue of a general\r\ntheory and of a supposed play on words, Eimbeck, Aimbock Bock—than\r\nas an actual fact.[13] He says that “the Munich Aimbock or Bock was\r\nmade before 1616, the same that is now sold at the beginning of May on\r\nCorpus Christi day.” Now, however, it has been shown that all through\r\nthe second half of the sixteenth century (1553-1574) Aimpecker and\r\nEimbecker beer was spoken of, and that there was an import of beer to\r\nVienna from Eimbeck as late as 1771, while no trace of any play of\r\nwords on the name is discovered. Moreover, that the “bock cellar”[14]\r\n(on the place of the present Restaurant Bonner) was in full operation\r\nat the beginning of the present century, is shown by Chr. Mueller\r\nwho wrote under Max Joseph, and described the manners of the place\r\nvery nearly as they were to be observed recently, just before the\r\ndisappearance of this historical locality, and it is doubtless the\r\nfact that the larger half of the reputation of Munich beer is due to\r\nthis specialty. Graesse, speaking of the high reputation of Bavarian\r\nbeer, in which he includes as a matter of course that of Munich, is\r\nof the opinion that the general preference for it does not reach\r\nback farther than the early part of this century, and produces some\r\nimportant evidence to support this view of the case. On the other hand\r\nit is to be claimed in opposition that in such a discussion a careful\r\ndistinction is to be made between Bavarian beer and Munich beer, since\r\nthe renown of the first is relatively new and hardly goes to the first\r\ntwenty years of the century, and its export did not begin in Munich,\r\nand also because that city has not yet been able to attain to the first\r\nrank as an exporter of beer. The reputation of Munich beer is older,\r\nfor Mueller (1816) speaks of it as celebrated, and complains that\r\nthe excellence of the native product is far surpassed by that of the\r\nToelzer and Dachauer beers, and that the latter prevail in the Munich\r\nbeer shops. This statement corresponds with the unfortunate situation\r\nof the beer interest that was inherited from the previous century,\r\nand that forces us to go back to the seventeenth century for a time\r\nof unquestioned supremacy for beer. In connection with this subject\r\nshould be mentioned the successful founding of the Munich Court Brewery\r\nby William V. at the end of the sixteenth century, and these same old\r\nrooms should be regarded as the center and starting point where the\r\nfame of Munich beer was born and nourished, and where even through\r\nall the epoch of perukes and cues, after the fall of the monasteries\r\nthat had contributed so much to the reputation of Munich beer, it was\r\npreserved from decay.\r\n\r\n[13] The Munich “Fremdenblatt” has lately expressed the same view.\r\n\r\n[14] In a coach house of the old _residenz_ in Munich, Bavaria.\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth century, in the time of Louis XIV., all Germany fell\r\nunder the sway of French influence. There were French conversation,\r\nprayers and oaths, French amusements and French sins, French eating\r\nand drinking. An effort to imitate all the French fashions that the\r\ncavaliers brought from Paris was a characteristic of the sad season\r\nthat followed, a time sad for patriots, sad for beer brewers and for\r\nbeer. Beer was _une boisson de commun_. The beautifully ornamented\r\nmugs and beakers were put away in the lumber-room (_rumpel kammer_)\r\nand champagne glasses from Paris took their place. At evening, where\r\nformerly the jovial barons and their chief followers had encamped round\r\nthe carved-oak table and laid a strong grasp on the mug—there was now\r\na service of cakes and tea, and where formerly milk and pepper or beer\r\nwas used as a morning draught, the coffee breakfast constantly acquired\r\nmore use and repute. The common people, however, stood fast for the old\r\nway, and were never better pleased than when the privileged beer came\r\nto honor. At this time, too, the change of rôles took place, and South\r\nGermany entered on its new and important course at the beginning of the\r\npresent century. (The brewery at St. Marx was built in 1710, and in\r\n1732 there were three brew-houses at Schwechat.)\r\n\r\nIt is as if the minds of men slumbered long, only to come at once into\r\na never suspected activity. In the midst of the tumult we find Balling,\r\nDreher, Sedlmayer, Kaiser, Otto and many others. Everything in brewing\r\nis changed. Laboratories spring out of the ground and discoveries and\r\ninventions come in countless numbers, brewing journals are started,\r\nschools opened, fairs and associations multiply, and all in the space\r\nof a single half century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n                       MODERN HISTORY OF BEER.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the account already given, it will be seen that beer not only\r\ntook an early hold on the affections of the people, but kept its\r\nposition wherever it was introduced. It is now well established in\r\nevery civilized country and plays so important a part in the economy of\r\nnations that a review of the light in which it is regarded by different\r\ngovernments cannot fail to be both interesting and useful.\r\n\r\nIn Germany the state uses every possible means to provide good,\r\nwholesome beer for the people. It is the habitual beverage of most\r\nof the population, used by them at their meals and their places of\r\namusement, cheering but not intoxicating, and rendering them temperate,\r\nindustrious, healthy and contented, a people whose bravery is beyond\r\nquestion, and whose peaceable yet progressive qualities tend to make\r\nthe nation powerful, and its government respected at home and abroad.\r\nAnd yet an advance by the government of half a cent a quart on the\r\nprice of beer has in years not long passed caused a serious riot.\r\nCheap, wholesome beer is considered a necessity of life, and the\r\nattempt to increase its cost an interference with the primary rights of\r\nthe community.\r\n\r\nIn Austro-Hungary, too, for many years government supervision has\r\nsecured the production of pure beer, which is sold at a very moderate\r\nprice. Some of the breweries are very large and the product is by\r\nmany held to be unsurpassed in quality. That of Vienna and Pilsen, in\r\nparticular, is universally known and esteemed. Beer is thoroughly the\r\nnational drink, and the beer gardens of Vienna are the resort of all\r\nclasses, from the Emperor down to his private soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe most important men of the empire have extensive breweries, and\r\namong the great Austro-Hungarian brewers we find such names as Anton\r\nDreher of Schwechat near Vienna, Count Arco Valley of Zell, Upper\r\nAustria, Count Arco Zinneburg of Kaltenhausen, Count Thurn Valsassina\r\nof Sorgendorf, and in Bohemia Count Thun Hohenstein of Alt Benatek,\r\nHis Majesty the Emperor Franz Josef, Prince Carl Hohenzollern, Prince\r\nTrautmansdorf, Prince Josef Mansfeld, Prince J. A. Schwartzenberg,\r\nPrince Max Thurn Taxis, the Grand Duke of Tuscany, Rudolf Count von\r\nSchoteck and many others.\r\n\r\nA correspondent says: “At Trieste the drinking of beer is universal;\r\nfrom infancy to age light wine and beer are the common beverages.”\r\nHe states that on Saturday night a pretty large number of laboring\r\npeople are “jolly drunk,” but not savage drunk. The latter condition is\r\nunknown except among English and American sailors visiting the port.\r\nAmong the better classes no instance is known of a merchant, lawyer,\r\nphysician, shop-keeper, or master-mechanic becoming an inebriate and\r\ngradually losing position, prosperity and business, and sinking into\r\na drunkard’s grave. Sometimes an Englishman or American has ruined\r\nhimself by the use of spirits—not of wine or beer.\r\n\r\nHolland has brewed good beer for centuries, and though this country\r\nhas been better known as a producer of gin, the national beverage is\r\ncertainly beer. Professors Tilamus and Swingar of Amsterdam, and the\r\nSecretary of the “Netherlands Society for the Abolition of Spirituous\r\nDrinks,” say that gin drinking is no longer respectable, and they\r\nrecommend beer as a daily beverage. The beer gardens of Amsterdam and\r\nRotterdam are very widely known. Good bands are provided and people of\r\nall ranks congregate to sip beer, smoke, talk, or listen to the music.\r\nOn his first visit to these places the writer made careful inquiries\r\nas to the consumption of gin and other spirits, and was agreeably\r\nsurprised to learn that their use was practically confined to the\r\nlowest classes and that beer was the common beverage. To find a drunken\r\nman it was necessary to go to the docks and wharves, among the Irish\r\nand American sailors. Nine-tenths of the gin manufactured is exported\r\nto the United States, and most of its use at home is for medical\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nThe little kingdom of Belgium ranks next Bavaria as a beer consuming\r\ncountry. There are three kinds of beer—Mars, a light beer and generally\r\nused by the laboring class, Lambic, strong and light, and the Faro,\r\na mixture of Mars and Lambic. Brussels and Antwerp have some of the\r\nfinest beer gardens in the world, which furnish music to their patrons\r\nequal to the best, and the general habits of the people are temperate.\r\nDrunkenness is hardly found even among the lower classes.\r\n\r\nSpain even is becoming a beer-drinking country. The beer formerly\r\nconsumed there was imported from England, Germany and Austria, and\r\nin 1869 all the breweries in the country did not produce 500,000\r\nliters, equal to 132,062 gallons, while the returns of the year 1878\r\nshow a production of over 4,750,000 liters, or 1,254,594 gallons—an\r\nastonishing increase in a wine producing country—and the beer brewed at\r\nthe Santa Barbara brewery at Madrid is taking the lead of the imported\r\narticle.\r\n\r\nSweden and Norway also recognize the necessity of providing a wholesome\r\nstimulant for the people, and for more than a hundred and fifty years\r\ntheir respective governments have given attention to the matter. Not\r\nlong ago patents for the manufacture of ardent spirits, which had\r\nlong been held among the nobility, were revoked, and an attempt made\r\nto secure temperance through the more common use of malt liquors. Mr.\r\nGeorge Hayward, then proprietor of the celebrated Lion Brewery at\r\nLondon, England,[15] was engaged by the government to superintend the\r\nintroduction of improved beer in Sweden, and the experiment proved a\r\nthorough success. As beer increased drunkenness diminished, and both\r\ngovernment and people have recognized the benefits of malt liquors.\r\nAccording to figures lately furnished by Dr. Ellis Sodenbladh of the\r\nSwedish statistical bureau, beer brewing has attained the position of a\r\nleading industry in that country. The annual product exceeds twenty-six\r\nmillion gallons, and this result is largely due to an increased tax on\r\nspirits and the remission of all taxation on beer, which may now be\r\nfairly considered the national beverage.\r\n\r\n[15] Mr. Hayward died a short time ago at Albany, N. Y.\r\n\r\nDenmark formerly consumed great quantities of ardent spirits, the\r\namount used in proportion to the population being even greater than in\r\nthe prohibitory state of Maine. The introduction of the excellent beer\r\nmade by Jacobsen at Carlsberg brought about an entire change. Beer is\r\nnow the drink of the country and public feeling is strongly opposed to\r\nthe use of whisky. The people have become remarkable for quiet and good\r\norder, and the police magistrates of the larger cities, as Copenhagen\r\nand Elsinore report that for a long time no cases of murder, homicide\r\nor theft brought before them have been traced to the influence of\r\nstrong drink. Arrests for street disorder are very rare and chiefly\r\nconfined among the foreign seamen. The consumption of beer is about\r\ntwenty gallons annually to the individual, and this amount seems to\r\nproduce only favorable effects, as the people are a strong, hardy race\r\nwith an average longevity far above that of the United States. The\r\nadvantages of all kinds that have followed the general introduction of\r\nbeer are very remarkable.\r\n\r\nIn Russia, a commission was some time ago appointed to investigate\r\nthe question of drunkenness in the empire. The use of strong ardent\r\nspirits had been almost universal. Drunkards were not to be reckoned by\r\nindividuals or even families. Whole districts were plunged in habits\r\nof brutal intoxication and this national pest demoralized the armies,\r\nfilled poor-houses and hospitals, the lunatic asylums and the prisons.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the labors of this commission, and in accordance with\r\nthe unanimous report of its members, the Czar has recently conferred\r\nvery valuable privileges on those who establish breweries in his\r\ndominions. The object being to secure for the people good beer at a low\r\nprice, all taxes on beer and articles used in its manufacture have been\r\nabolished, while the use of ardent spirits is still further checked by\r\nthe imposition of heavy duties on all introduced to the country, and\r\nsevere taxes on its manufacture or sale; and[16] whenever the crop of\r\nbarley turns out to be light, the government prohibits exporting the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\n[16] Owing to a light crop the Russian government has prohibited the\r\nexport of barley for the current year, 1879.\r\n\r\nIn Greece, breweries are springing up about Athens and the Piræus, and\r\nall over the Levant and the neighboring islands, and the _ek krithon\r\nmethu_ (barley wine) of olden times is going to be the ordinary\r\nbeverage of the people instead of the rather strong wines that the\r\ncountry produces.\r\n\r\nIn France during the reign of Napoleon III., it was discovered that\r\nthe ardent spirits most in use were so adulterated as to produce\r\nserious injury to consumers apart from that which always attends the\r\nfree use of these liquors. Spirits were used to a much greater extent\r\nthan could be justified on any sound principle. The Emperor, whose\r\npractical judgment was excellent in matters not immediately affecting\r\nhis own ambition, offered inducements to English and German brewers to\r\nestablish themselves in the country and the consumption of beer was\r\nincreased with very advantageous results. The change has already gone\r\nso far as to alarm the wine merchants, and according to the “British\r\nMercantile Gazette” the consumption in Paris alone now reaches one\r\nhundred million _liter_ bottles _per annum_ or nearly half a pint a day\r\nto every Parisian, which is not bad for a beginning. The beer used,\r\nhowever, is still chiefly of foreign manufacture, the lager beer coming\r\nchiefly from Vienna and Bavaria, and the ale from Alsopp and Bass. Some\r\nAmerican brewers of New York, Philadelphia and St. Louis received gold\r\nmedals at Paris for the excellence of their beer, and are now shipping\r\nconsiderable quantities to that place.\r\n\r\nAmericans who have lately been in France must usually have been\r\nsurprised to notice how _bogk_ (lager beer) is already the common\r\nbeverage in the fashionable _cafés_ of the chief cities.\r\n\r\nSome leading French savants trace a direct connection between the free\r\nuse of beer and the national greatness and indomitable personal courage\r\nof their opponents in the late war, and hope by the development of\r\nthe brewing interest to add to the traditional virtues of Frenchmen\r\nsome of those displayed in the neighboring empire. The notion may be\r\nrather fine spun, but the actual benefit of the development of a home\r\nindustry in beer will be none the less, and it cannot be doubted that\r\ntheir end will be at least partially attained, though perhaps not in\r\nso direct a fashion as they suppose. Monsieur Lunier has just brought\r\nbefore the French Academy of Medicine, some very interesting statistics\r\non the use of fermented and other liquors. According to him, wine is\r\nstill the national drink. The consumption of cider is diminishing,\r\nalthough still large, and brandy is much used to facilitate the\r\ndigestion of cider. The more cider, the more brandy. The quantity of\r\nbeer used, has considerably increased in most of the Departments,\r\nand he proves conclusively that most cases of accidental death in\r\nconsequence of excess, occur in the departments where there is most\r\ndrinking of spirits, that apprehensions for drunkenness are five times\r\nas numerous in these Departments as in those where wine is chiefly\r\nused, that drunkenness in the beer-drinking regions is hardly known,\r\nand that alcoholic insanity is almost everywhere in proportion to the\r\nconsumption of ardent spirits. The only exceptions are La Vendée and\r\nCharente Inferieure where they drink only white wines, but use them in\r\nimmoderate quantities.\r\n\r\nFrench brewers are now engaged in forming an association and the first\r\nmeeting has been announced to take place at Toulouse, in the late\r\nautumn of the present year (1879). The _Industriel de Lyon_ speaks of\r\nthe matter as follows:\r\n\r\n“In consequence of their number, and as representing forty-two\r\ndepartments, the brewers who should support this association are most\r\ninfluential. They would, by means of combination, be able to properly\r\nprotect their important industry, and struggle against errors of the\r\npast, such as excise regulations, octroi, etc. Besides the meetings of\r\nthe Syndicate, whether held at Toulouse or Lyons, might take up general\r\neconomical questions of interest to its members, and also deal with\r\nthe fabrication of beer, malting, and the scientific phenomena, which\r\nare more numerous and complex than is imagined. Brewing, it is further\r\nasserted, is an industry of the future. Beer is a drink of progress\r\non account of its refreshing and especially nutritive qualities.\r\nTo produce beer cheap, appetizing to the eye, and agreeable to the\r\nstomach, is the program which the brewers of the South have in view,\r\nand which they must strive energetically to carry out if they wish\r\nto compete at all successfully with the German beers. The phylloxera\r\nis not an eternal enemy. Sooner or later science will neutralize its\r\neffects.\r\n\r\n“In the South of France, therefore, the opinion is held that the\r\ngreatest care should be given to the production of beer. Besides,\r\npeople in the South do not drink the good wine which they produce; they\r\nexport it. Money is more valuable to them than good wine. Inferior\r\nwine, however, remains, and is consumed to a great extent. We are of\r\nopinion that beer would offer to all considerable advantages; and\r\ntherefore it is desirable that the brewing industry in the South of\r\nFrance should be developed in the fullest possible manner.”\r\n\r\nIn England about the year 1833 the use of intoxicating liquors had\r\nincreased to such a point that government applied itself to the\r\ndiscovery of some means of diminishing the consumption. The Duke\r\nof Wellington, whose long career as a soldier on the continent and\r\nelsewhere had taught him the beneficial influence of beer, and who\r\nsaw clearly the amount of misery and degradation caused among his\r\ncountrymen by the use of distilled liquors, introduced while Prime\r\nMinister, the well known “Beer Bill.” Its passage was urged distinctly\r\non the ground that a free consumption of beer would greatly diminish\r\nthe use of spirits. The Duke himself strongly advocated the bill and\r\ninstanced the continental beer-drinking countries as the happiest and\r\nmost temperate on the globe.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand the so-called temperance men appeared in large\r\ndeputations to urge (against all reason) that whatever beer might be\r\nconsumed would be in addition to the previous consumption of ardent\r\nspirits and not in place of it, or any part of it, that intoxication\r\nwould be increased in a ratio correspondent to the amount of beer used,\r\nand in short that the proposed plan of reform was much like an attempt\r\nto quench fire by pouring on oil. The bill, however, was at last passed\r\nby a large majority and has proved very successful. The consumption\r\nof beer has largely increased, distilled liquors are less used, and,\r\nnotwithstanding the assertions of some over-zealous partisans of total\r\nabstinence, we can prove by statistics carefully collected that the\r\namount of drunkenness in the country began to decrease immediately\r\nafter the passage of the bill. William E. Gladstone, the great English\r\nstatesman who, in the year 1868-9, carried through Parliament an act\r\nintended to promote the cause of temperance by cheapening wine and\r\nbeer and making their sale part of the business of restaurants and\r\nconfectioners’ shops, wrote a short time ago as follows: “I am opposed\r\nto coffee and tea palaces as I believe they are more deteriorating than\r\nbeer shops. The stimulating properties of coffee or tea are greater and\r\nmore injurious than those of malt liquors.”\r\n\r\nThe course advocated by the Duke of Wellington and Mr. Gladstone has\r\nbeen fully justified by the results. Drunkenness has decreased and\r\nbreweries have multiplied. The measure of advantage is to be found in\r\nthe increase of large breweries whose product is distributed through\r\nmany channels, for these furnish what is to take the place of the\r\nardent spirit formerly consumed when one was away from home or wanted a\r\nchange from the home-brewed ale to which he was accustomed. They also\r\nattract the favor of the poorer classes because they furnish so much\r\nmore in bulk and nutritive power at the same or a less price.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, many small breweries, such as those attached\r\nto country inns or to private houses. Some breweries also confine\r\ntheir business to supplying families with pale and table ales, stout\r\nor porter, in small barrels of four and a half, nine, and eighteen\r\ngallons. The number of breweries in Great Britain—aside from those\r\nwhich are strictly for private use—is, according to official returns,\r\ntwenty-six thousand, two hundred and fourteen, which it will be seen is\r\nabout nine times the number in the United States. The cost of good ale\r\nis about one shilling sterling a gallon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: M. T. BASS, ESQ. MP.\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT BURTON-ON-TRENT BREWER, ENGLAND.]\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of notice that the brewers of England are distinguished\r\nfor a wise generosity and public spirit, and such men as Charington,\r\nFox, Meux, Alsopp, Hanbury, Buxton, Mann, Truman, Guinness, Walker\r\nand Bass,[17] will be long remembered for the magnificent charities\r\nthat ennoble and perpetuate their names. To a greater or less degree\r\nthe same characteristic comes to light in every country where beer\r\nis established as the popular beverage. Jacobsen, a brewer of\r\nCopenhagen, before his death set aside $280,000 to found a laboratory\r\nof scientific research. A part of the money is to be spent in keeping\r\nup the laboratories attached to his brewery, in which chemical and\r\nphysiological researches are carried on with a view to establish as\r\ncompletely as possible a scientific basis for brewing and malting.\r\n\r\n[17] Michael Thomas Bass, the senior member of Parliament for Derby, is\r\nbest known as the largest brewer in the world. He is now over eighty\r\nyears old, and has been engaged in the brewery business founded by his\r\ngrandfather for about sixty-two years. He was educated at the Buxton\r\nGrammar School, and has supplemented this early instruction by a course\r\nof reading that leaves him not at all behind many University men in\r\nthe matter of scholarly attainments. He has always been noted for the\r\nefficient discharge of his public and private duties, and has for more\r\nthan thirty years represented the old town of Derby as senior member\r\nof Parliament. His public and private gifts have been frequent and\r\nmunificent, the last of importance being a free library for the town of\r\nDerby.\r\n\r\nThe generous juice of barley, seems to draw out the more kindly and\r\nhuman feelings of all who have their dealings in it. Can any such thing\r\nbe said of distilled liquors?\r\n\r\nThe late Khedive of Egypt, who has done more for the advancement of\r\nthat country than any other ruler since the time of the Pharaohs,\r\nperceived the advantages to be gained by the introduction of beer, and\r\ngranted very valuable privileges to a company of Swiss brewers, whose\r\nestablishment is now in full and successful operation at Cairo. The\r\nconsumption is chiefly in the cities which are largely inhabited by\r\nEuropeans, generally disposed to drink beer if it is good and readily\r\nattainable, but sure to use stronger drinks if the beer is wanting, and\r\nperhaps, from the circumstance of residence at a distance from home,\r\nmore apt to use any intoxicating liquor to excess.\r\n\r\nJapan, a kingdom hardly known to us twenty-five years ago, and now\r\nrecognized as one of the most highly civilized in the world, has thus\r\nfar suffered very little from intoxicating drinks. Native stimulants\r\nhave been used, and in some cases have proved as injurious as strong\r\nwhisky, though perhaps more strictly harmful to the individual, and\r\nless so to his family and the community. The people are by nature and\r\neducation gentle and polite, and their social manners are in many\r\nparticulars a lesson to Europeans. They are usually temperate in all\r\nthings, happy and contented. The Mikado, however, wisely considering\r\nthat in the growing intercourse of Japan with foreign countries, a\r\ntaste for ardent spirits can hardly fail to be developed, unless some\r\ncounteracting influence be at work, has decided to foster the erection\r\nof beer breweries, and thus avert as far as possible an impending\r\ndanger, while at the same time he gives his subjects an innocent and\r\nrefreshing beverage. With this view, the representatives of Japan,\r\nnow in Germany, have been directed to enter into arrangements with\r\nwell-known brewers, for the erection of large breweries in Yokohama,\r\nTokio, Saga, Nagasaki and Shidz-u-o-ka.\r\n\r\nThe Shah of Persia also, is so far convinced of the advantages of beer,\r\nas to have made arrangements during his last visit to Vienna, for\r\nparties there to undertake its introduction in his kingdom.\r\n\r\nIn Turkey, there are at Constantinople six breweries with an annual\r\nproduct of about one hundred and twenty thousand gallons. The hops are\r\nimported from Germany, but the other materials are supplied by the\r\ncountry. After the island of Cyprus passed from Turkish to English\r\nrule, it is worthy of notice that the first shipment by the _Thessalia_\r\nwas fifty barrels of beer, a shipment well illustrating English\r\nnational habits.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the beer trade in the United States being part of the\r\ngeneral subject of this book, and especially illustrated in the chapter\r\nunder the heading “The Condition and Prospects of the Beer Trade,” and\r\nalso in the list of breweries given in Appendix C, needs no remark here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n                  HOW BEER IS MADE AND WHAT IT IS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe production of beer, as of all other malt liquors, bears a striking\r\nsimilarity to the making of bread; the chief difference being in the\r\nquantity of grain employed, and the amount of water added. The one\r\nintended for a solid food is baked, the other for a liquid refreshment\r\nis boiled.\r\n\r\nThe process of making beer is as follows: A certain quantity of malted\r\nbarley is taken and ground, it is then mashed with hot water, the\r\nsweet liquor or wort extracted, a portion of hops added, and the whole\r\nboiled until the preservative quality as well as the aroma of the hops\r\nis obtained. It is then allowed to cool, and afterwards fermented\r\nwith yeast to produce the small quantity of alcohol it contains, and\r\nto give it life. According to analyses made by different chemists,\r\nlager beer contains 91.0 water, 5.4 malt extract, 3.5 alcohol, and the\r\nremainder—making in all 100 parts—carbonic acid. Ale and porter differ\r\nonly in having a slight additional percentage of alcohol, and a large\r\namount of solid extract.\r\n\r\nThe substantial and useful character of the chief ingredient of beer\r\nmay be seen from the nature of an analysis of the malt which forms\r\nits basis. The result is from Dr. Lermer, whose researches in this\r\ndirection have been of great value.\r\n\r\n                        DRY BARLEY.      DRY MALT.

It\r\nhas been supposed that the whole of this alcohol was expelled by heat\r\nduring baking; but recent experiments indicate that a perceptible\r\namount still remains in yeast-raised bread after baking. The result of\r\nsix experiments, showed that one-third of one per cent. in weight of\r\nalcohol was obtained from fresh baked bread. From forty loaves of fresh\r\nbread, two pounds each, alcohol equal to one bottle of port wine may be\r\nextracted.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated Professor Balling of Prague, who has spent much time in\r\nthe chemical analysis of different fermented beverages, arrives at the\r\nfollowing result in reference to lager beer: “Lager beer manufactured\r\nof malt and hops according to the noble rules of brewing, properly\r\nfermented, stored for some time and perfectly clear, is a healthy\r\nand agreeable beverage, which when partaken of quenches thirst and\r\nstrengthens, and thus combines the qualities of water, wine and food.\r\nThe water is the thirst-quenching element, the wine the enlivening, the\r\nmalt extract (composed of sugar, gum, etc.) the nourishing, and the\r\ncarbonic acid gas the refreshing, while the hop extract strengthens the\r\nstomach, helps digestion, acts on the bladder and is grateful to the\r\nhuman constitution. There is no doubt that lager beer brewed and stored\r\nstrictly as before mentioned is hardly intoxicating.”\r\n\r\nAn impression has gained ground in some quarters that as a matter of\r\nfact, beer is extensively and injuriously adulterated and certain\r\npersons claiming to be well informed have spread statements that\r\npotato starch, grape sugar, glycerine and molasses are added as\r\nsubstitutes for malt (barley), that Indian corn and rice are used\r\ninstead of barley, that pine bark, quassia, walnut leaf, wormwood,\r\nbitter clover, aloes, picric acid, cocculus indicus and strychnine\r\nare substituted for hops, and that various chemicals are used to\r\nneutralize acidity or conceal dilution. A few of the first named would\r\nnot be objectionable, unless in point of flavor, and as a matter of\r\nfact all of the substances named may at some time have been used by\r\nirresponsible brewers. A careful inquiry, however, has satisfied us\r\nthat the adulteration of beer is rare, and one who reflects on the\r\nlively competition that exists in the trade must see how speedily\r\nand surely such a practice would be detected and exposed by business\r\nrivals. Touching the use of strychnine in particular, Dr. Ure says that\r\n\r\n1st. “Strychnine is exceedingly costly.\r\n\r\n2d. “It has a most unpleasant bitter, metallic taste.\r\n\r\n3d. “It is a notorious poison whose use would ruin the reputation of\r\nany brewer.\r\n\r\n4th. “It cannot be introduced into ordinary beer brewed with hops\r\nbecause it is entirely precipitated by the infusion of that wholesome,\r\nfragrant herb. * * * * Were the _nux-vomica_ powder from which\r\nstrychnia is extracted even stealthily thrown into the mash tun, its\r\ndangerous principle would be all infallibly thrown down with the\r\ngrounds in the subsequent boiling with the hops.”\r\n\r\nWhen we remember the immense improvement in the quality of American\r\nbeer within the past few years and learn how often expensive machinery\r\nand appliances have been abandoned after a short use in favor of\r\nsomething better, we can hardly believe that brewers who conduct their\r\nbusiness after such a fashion, will at the same time try to make a\r\npetty profit by using poor material and so deteriorating the product on\r\nwhose excellence the success of their business depends. The genuineness\r\nof beer from any established brewery may usually be taken for granted.\r\nIn 1872 after an extensive examination of beers in Great Britain only\r\nsix samples were found to be adulterated.[18]\r\n\r\n[18] Encyclopedia Britannica, Art. Brewing.\r\n\r\nAn effort has been made by many so-called temperance papers to\r\ndisseminate an opposite view in this matter and the statements made can\r\nonly be excused on the ground of ignorance—which in the circumstances\r\nis inexcusable. No doubt beer has been often adulterated, but to\r\nrepresent the practice as common or as prevailing in breweries that\r\nexpect to live and that have a character to maintain is to speak in\r\ncontradiction to the facts and to common sense. Lately at Newark, New\r\nJersey, charges of this general nature were made by a total abstinence\r\nspeaker and the matter was for once taken up by the brewers of the\r\ncity, in whose behalf a well known member of the trade addressed the\r\nfollowing letter to the orator of the day:\r\n\r\nThe REV. W. F. BOOLE, Brooklyn:\r\n\r\n  SIR—In a lecture delivered by you at Park Hall, Newark, N. J., on\r\n  Sunday afternoon, July 13, 1879, you are reported in the _Newark\r\n  Morning Register_ to have said: “The traffic is a traffic of compound\r\n  poisons, and not even the finest imported liquors are free from\r\n  them. Strychnine and stramonium, two deadly poisons, are used in the\r\n  manufacture of beer, and a little potash is added to prevent the\r\n  taste. Belladonna, one of the most virulent of poisons, is also used,\r\n  and not less than 10,000 tons of the deadly cocculus are consumed.\r\n  Cocculus is never given as a medicine, but it is drank daily by the\r\n  masses in their beer and ale.”\r\n\r\n  You, as a teacher of religion, should be a lover of truth. On behalf\r\n  of the brewers of the United States, I denounce this statement as a\r\n  deliberate falsehood, and I challenge you to prove any part of it;\r\n  and in the event of your not doing so, or withdrawing your assertion,\r\n  I shall not only take steps to publish the fact that you are a\r\n  willful perverter of the truth, but also to prosecute you for slander.\r\n\r\n                                          Yours truly,\r\n\r\n                                                 (Signed) C. FEIGENSPAN.\r\n\r\nThereupon the lecturer made answer that the papers had not reported\r\nhim correctly. Here the matter might have dropped, and there was\r\nin fact an end of this particular phase of the question. The case,\r\nhowever, had made a stir and presently a representative of the teetotal\r\nparty called at the office of the United States Brewing Association\r\nto collect information which was given him as a matter of course.\r\nThen came a proposition from the same party for a public discussion\r\non the following extraordinary terms. Twelve propositions were to be\r\nadvanced and supported by a practiced speaker on the teetotal side.\r\nThe representative of the Newark Brewers was to have an opportunity to\r\nreply to each, and the other speaker was then to sum up and conclude\r\nthe discussion. The brewers’ representative had only three days notice\r\nand naturally declined any such arrangement in which all the advantage\r\nwas evidently assumed by the other side. The discussion also was to\r\nbe confined to one evening, and a collection was to be taken up “to\r\ndefray expenses.” The Newark Brewers’ Association, however, expressed\r\ntheir willingness to debate on fair terms and with one evening for each\r\nproposition, but this arrangement was declined. We have taken pains\r\nto procure the twelve propositions of the total abstinence club, and\r\nappend them here chiefly in order to call attention to the fact that\r\nthe greater part are especially treated in this book, while the others\r\nare touched incidentally or by direct inference. The propositions are\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n  No. 1.—The use of malt liquors is a direct cause of intemperance.\r\n\r\n  No. 2.—The use of malt liquors tends to the use of stronger liquors.\r\n\r\n  No. 3.—Malt liquors, if habitually used to any considerable extent,\r\n  tend to cause ill-health.\r\n\r\n  No. 4.—The claim that malt liquors are valuable as food is without\r\n  foundation.\r\n\r\n  No. 5.—As a medicine, malt liquors are of use only to those who do\r\n  not ordinarily use them, and are dangerous because of their tendency\r\n  to create habit.\r\n\r\n  No. 6.—The theory that malt liquors can be substituted by consumers\r\n  of alcoholic beverages for distilled liquors, to any important\r\n  extent, is false.\r\n\r\n  No. 7.—Beer in this country is far more evil in its effects than in\r\n  Germany; but even there its bad effects, as used by the people, are\r\n  obvious to every traveler who has no theory to maintain.\r\n\r\n  No. 8.—The use of beer by the working classes has a direct relation\r\n  to poverty.\r\n\r\n  No. 9.—The use of malt liquors by the masses has a relation to crime,\r\n  which, though differing in some respects from that of distilled\r\n  liquors, is marked and alarming.\r\n\r\n  No. 10.—Beer saloons and gardens, as a whole, are demoralizing in\r\n  their effects on individuals, families, and especially on children.\r\n\r\n  No. 11.—The great increase in the use of malt liquors and the\r\n  increase in intemperance for the past fifteen years have been\r\n  parallel, and are intimately connected.\r\n\r\n  No. 12.—That beer saloons should be subjected to the same\r\n  restrictions under which ordinary grog shops are placed.\r\n\r\nFurther comment would be superfluous, especially as this whole matter\r\nis, strictly speaking, a digression from the purpose of the chapter,\r\nalthough one that is so natural as to be almost inevitable.\r\n\r\nThere has also been much misrepresentation of the views of prominent\r\nmen. For instance, the _Religious Herald_ of Hartford, Conn., recently\r\nreprinted an article in which it is asserted that Professor Liebig “has\r\nproved to a certainty that as much flour as can lie on the point of\r\na table knife is more nutritious than eight quarts of Bavarian beer,\r\ncounted the best made. Also that the man who drinks two gallons of\r\nBavarian beer a day for a year, gets only as much nutriment from his\r\nseven hundred and thirty gallons as he would from one five-pound loaf\r\nof bread or three pounds of flesh!” The article has been extensively\r\ncopied all over the country and is calculated to do much harm by\r\nthrowing the influence of an important name on a side where it was\r\nnever intended to go.\r\n\r\nNow it is barely possible that Professor Liebig made such a statement\r\nas to nutriment of a special form, though we are not aware of any\r\npassage that can give the least color to the assertion. On the other\r\nhand his real view appears in such passages as the following: “Pure\r\nlager beer, when taken with lean flesh and little bread yields a diet\r\napproaching to milk; with fat meat, approaching to rice or potatoes.”\r\nAnd again, “In beer-drinking countries it is the universal medicine\r\nfor the healthy as well as for the sick, and it is milk to the aged.”\r\nThese views are shared by almost all the eminent men who have made\r\na scientific study of beer, and the opinions and results reached\r\nby a large number of chemists of high authority will be found in a\r\nsubsequent chapter. “We have anticipated thus much here because in\r\ndescribing beer as it is, it seemed necessary to indicate to some\r\ndegree what it is not, at least so far as to explain that it is not\r\ngenerally adulterated, and is not wholly useless, as a large party\r\nconstantly asserts it to be.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n           THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALE, PORTER AND LAGER BEER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been already mentioned that the earliest beers were made without\r\nhops. After the use of this plant was discovered beer brewing as an\r\nart made rapid progress, and not only did every country make its own\r\nspecial sort of beer, but many varieties existed side by side in most\r\nof the German states and in England. Experiments were made with all\r\nsorts of grain, with potatoes and with plants and herbs, the object\r\nbeing in every case to produce a wort whose beer should have special\r\nadvantages in point of flavor or cost or both. Gradually, however, most\r\nof the materials were quietly dropped, although potatoes are still used\r\nfor the Strasbourg beer, and wheat forms an important element of the\r\nfamous white beer of northern Germany. Barley is the grain that has\r\nuniversally been found best adapted to the purpose of making a brown\r\nbeer of an agreeable flavor and of moderate price. With the question\r\nof material thus practically settled, it might be supposed that the\r\ndifference between various brews of beer would disappear. On the\r\ncontrary the number of varieties is to-day greater than ever before.\r\nEvery step in the manufacture, from the selection of the grain and hops\r\non to the final delivery of the product to the consumer, has something\r\nto do with the characteristics of the beer, and the difficulty does not\r\nlie in producing something new, but in reproducing accurately what has\r\nonce been successfully tested.\r\n\r\nWhatever the distinguishing features of the product, it is still\r\nbeer, and any one specimen of the genus has the general properties of\r\nall the others. All beer has a notably small percentage of alcohol,\r\nthe strongest ales and porters showing less than many specimens of\r\ncider; all contain an appreciable amount of solid nutriment which in\r\nsome heavy-bodied beers is quite considerable; all are palatable and\r\nwholesome, and all are adapted to take the place of ardent spirits and\r\nthus reduce intemperance and drunkenness to a _minimum_. It is hardly\r\nnecessary to explain that in this book the word beer is used in its\r\nwide sense. When special varieties are meant they are spoken of by name\r\nunless the context is such as to remove all doubt.\r\n\r\nAfter the time of experiment and the disuse of most of the grains,\r\netc., that had been tried, there still remained two well-marked\r\nvarieties differing essentially in the mode of fermentation, and\r\nour modern ale and lager beer may be taken as types of the two\r\nkinds. The former is fermented rapidly at a high temperature and the\r\nfermentation checked while a considerable portion of sugar still\r\nremains unchanged, while the latter is fermented slowly and thoroughly\r\nat a low temperature. The first process is the one originally employed\r\neverywhere and has held almost undisputed ground in England, where,\r\nas might in such circumstances be expected, ale-brewing has reached\r\nits most thorough development. At the beginning of the eighteenth\r\ncentury there were in that country three recognized sorts, ale, beer\r\nand two-penny, differing chiefly in the quantity of malt used for\r\neach kind. These were often mixed to suit customers and in 1730,\r\nto avoid the trouble of constant mixing, a new drink was brewed,\r\ncalled “entire,” and meant to resemble the triple compound. This was\r\nafterwards known as porter, and at present the general distinction is\r\nbetween porter and ale, though we still hear of small beer. The variety\r\nof ales, however, is very great. They are made of all colors and all\r\ndegrees of strength, very bitter like the pale ale, and sweetish\r\nlike the Scotch ale, so long-lived that they can be exported to hot\r\nclimates and kept for years, and so short-lived that they must be\r\nused within three or four weeks. Some are perfectly clear and bright,\r\nand resemble nothing so much as Rhine wine, of whose flavor also they\r\nhave an indescribable suggestion, while others are dark with solid\r\nextract and possess a characteristic delicate flavor that resembles\r\nnothing else. In this respect America is yet far in the rear. There is\r\nplenty of good ale but there has been no demand sufficient to cause so\r\nvaried a supply or to develop so well-marked special flavors. When,\r\nhowever, we remember for how long a time cider was the common drink\r\nof the people to the exclusion of beer, and see how, in spite of such\r\nan obstacle at the start, the business gradually gained ground, and\r\nwhen we remember that outside the larger cities, even twenty years\r\nago, ale was almost sure to be dull and muddy and very apt to be sour,\r\nwe must admit that American ale-brewers have accomplished much. They\r\nhave succeeded so far as to secure a large sale for their brew, and\r\nso far that now almost anywhere one is certain of a tolerable glass\r\nof beer—unless the existence of a prohibitory law excludes everything\r\nbut whisky. Their success appears the more striking because of the\r\nrecent great increase in the use of lager beer, for enormous as is the\r\nconsumption of the latter it has hardly produced any effect on the\r\nsales of the ale-brewers. There is a large number who prefer the flavor\r\nof ale, others drink it from habit and will always do so, others drink\r\nit because they ape English fashions, others because the comparatively\r\nsecluded and unsocial character imported from England to our ale-houses\r\nsuits them better than the more social and gregarious customs of the\r\nlager beer garden, some even because it is usually the more costly of\r\nthe two beverages. Some doubtless prefer it because it usually contains\r\na little more alcohol than lager beer, and very many use either beer\r\nindifferently according to circumstances and convenience.\r\n\r\nAs to porter there is little that need be said. Its origin has been\r\nalready mentioned, and when we add that the color is due to browned\r\nmalt and its flavor to seeds or the like we have stated all that would\r\ninterest the general reader. It is essentially a heavy-bodied ale,\r\nhowever great the superficial unlikeness.\r\n\r\nThe difference in the manner of fermentation of ale and lager beer has\r\nbeen previously indicated, but the following passage from Professor\r\nLiebig will be found of interest: “In that country (Bavaria) the malt\r\nwort is set to ferment in open backs with an extensive surface, and\r\nplaced in cool cellars having an atmospheric temperature not exceeding\r\n8° or 10° C (46½ or 50 F.). The operation lasts from three to four\r\nweeks; the carbonic acid is disengaged, not in large bubbles that burst\r\non the surface of the liquid, but in very small vesicles like those of\r\na mineral water or of a liquor saturated with carbonic acid when the\r\npressure is removed. The surface of the fermenting wort is always in\r\ncontact with the oxygen of the atmosphere as it is hardly covered with\r\nfroth and as all the yeast is deposited at the bottom of the back under\r\nthe form of a very viscid sediment, called in German _unterhefe_.”\r\n\r\nThe process thus described results in the production of a beer which\r\nwill not sour even if kept exposed to the air for a long time. Barrels\r\nonly half full have remained uninjured for months. It is to be noticed,\r\nhowever, that both ale and lager beer can be prepared under many\r\nmodifications of the main plan, and both are often made for immediate\r\nuse without regard to keeping qualities and pass by the names of\r\npresent use ale and Schenck beer.\r\n\r\nAs lager beer usually contains a little less alcohol than ale, it has\r\nbeen most commonly spoken of by those who are striving to eradicate\r\nintemperance by introducing beer in the place of ardent spirits. The\r\ndifference in alcoholic strength is not, however, so great as many\r\npersons suppose, the percentage in ales ranging from 8.88 to 5.36,\r\nwhile that of lager beer varies from 6.50 to 3.06. The kind of beer to\r\nbe preferred for the work in any country is that best suited to the\r\ntastes and traditions of the people. On the continent of Europe and in\r\nAmerica lager beer has thus far played the more prominent part, while\r\nin England the responsibility of all that has been accomplished belongs\r\nto ale.\r\n\r\nIt is not improbable that the English brewing business has already\r\nreached its culminating point. A large part of the annual product\r\nhas long been exported to the colonies, and now these are beginning\r\nto brew beer for themselves and will soon have a supply of their own\r\nmake, sufficient in quality and quantity to make them independent of\r\nthe mother country. With us the case is different. The consumption is\r\nincreasing rapidly, and brewers show a wise liberality in securing\r\nnew processes and appurtenances, and spare no effort to improve the\r\nquality of their product. Those who make the best beer secure the\r\nmost custom, and the fraternity are fully aware of the fact. All this\r\nrivalry cannot fail to benefit the consumer. Every year sees better\r\nale and lager beer sent over the country, and every year something is\r\ncontributed to the solution of the problem in brewing—to produce a mild\r\nbeer that with more extract than is now found shall contain even less\r\nalcohol, and remain bright and refreshing. Whether full success in such\r\nan attempt is to be sooner reached by the ale or lager beer brewers\r\nremains to be seen, or it may well be that some new malt beverage may\r\nbe discovered, unlike either of the others and superior to both. Such a\r\nresult would be no more striking than other steps in progress already\r\nmade, and brewers of large experience are to be found who believe\r\nthat some such discovery is impending. In the meantime we have the\r\nsatisfaction of knowing that America already produces malt liquors made\r\nfrom native materials that are wholesome and agreeable and at least up\r\nto the average of similar liquors made in countries where brewing has\r\nbeen carefully studied and extensively practiced for centuries, while\r\nwith us it is chiefly a recent growth. The degree of success that is\r\npossible when we take into account the natural resources of the country\r\nand the enterprising character of the brewers is hardly to be realized.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n           THE CONDITIONS AND PROSPECTS OF THE BEER TRADE.\r\n\r\n  I believe that Germans are destined to be really the greatest\r\n  benefactors of this country by bringing to us—if we choose to accept\r\n  the boon—their beer. Lager beer contains less alcohol than any of the\r\n  native grape wines. This fact, with the other fact, that the Germans\r\n  have not the pernicious habits of our people, would, if we choose to\r\n  adopt their custom, tend to diminish intemperance in this country.\r\n\r\n                                                   DR.

READING, PA.\r\n\r\n_For historical sketch see Appendix C. Page 180._]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe brewing of ale has been so long an established industry in this\r\ncountry and advances so regularly from year to year as to offer no\r\nstriking facts for comment. With lager beer the case is different, and\r\nthe rapidity of the increase in its use is something remarkable. Fifty\r\nyears ago it was hardly known as a beverage in the United States. Now\r\nand then some good old German would import a keg from his native home\r\nin the old country, to be drunk on the occasion of some great family\r\nfestival, and call up in his adopted home thoughts of the merry days\r\nof youth and friendly faces, last seen perhaps in some deep valley of\r\nthe Tyrol or in the shadows of a city that was old when the Pilgrims\r\nlanded at Plymouth Rock. But in the case of so good a creature as lager\r\nbeer such occasional and almost poetical use could not always remain\r\nthe only one, and at last a German of Philadelphia conceived the idea\r\nof erecting a lager beer brewery. According to the Hon. Frederick Lauer\r\nof Reading, Pa., (and we have all reason to put implicit faith in his\r\nversion) it was introduced by one Wagner, a practical brewer who came\r\nfrom Germany to the United States in a sailing vessel in the year 1842,\r\nand shortly after landing he brewed the first lager in a miserable\r\nshanty on the outskirts of Philadelphia, and thus became the Gambrinus\r\nof America. (We would here refer the reader to the biographical sketch\r\nof Frederick Lauer, Esq., in Appendix A.)\r\n\r\nHis success induced another German to try the same experiment on a\r\nsmall scale in the city of New York, and from this insignificant\r\nbeginning the business has increased to its present immense\r\nproportions, so that there are now according to the latest return\r\nof the Internal Revenue Department at Washington, no less than two\r\nthousand eight hundred and thirty ale and lager beer breweries in\r\nactive operation. The number is in fact considerably larger than that\r\ngiven by the Department, owing to the method of returning only those\r\nin actual business at the beginning of the year and to other causes.\r\nThe annual product according to the Department figures, is over three\r\nhundred million gallons. More exactly the figures are, 303,147,552\r\ngallons, or 9,473,361 barrels. In addition to this there are numerous\r\nprivate breweries where beer is made for home consumption but not for\r\nsale, and these do not fall under the Internal Revenue regulations and\r\nare consequently not reported.\r\n\r\nFigures as given below in reference to the capital invested in\r\nthe brewing, malting and hop business, and taken after careful\r\ninvestigation from the best sources attainable, will give the reader a\r\nfaint idea of its vast extent.\r\n\r\n                                CAPITAL.\r\n\r\n  Capital invested in 2,830 breweries in operation at the end of\r\n     the last fiscal year, (taking the low estimate of $10.00 upon\r\n     every barrel of malt beverage produced, viz.: 9,473,361\r\n     barrels at $10.00)                                  $94,733,610.00\r\n\r\n  Capital invested in 485 malt-houses of all dimensions having\r\n     altogether a malting capacity of 35,227,984 bushels:\r\n\r\n  Real estate,                          $16,567,562.00\r\n\r\n  Capital invested in the production,    18,620,950.00\r\n\r\n                                        ----------------- $35,188,512.00\r\n\r\n  Capital invested in 1,614,654 acres of land under cultivation for\r\n     barley,                                              $72,659,430.00\r\n\r\n  Capital invested in 67,216 acres of land under cultivation for\r\n     hops,                                                  2,689,232.00\r\n\r\n  Capital invested in gathering ice needed for brewers,    15,000,000.00\r\n\r\n  Capital invested in fodder of all kinds,                  5,000,000.00\r\n\r\n\r\n                                LABOR.\r\n\r\n  Men employed in breweries now in operation; men 22,640;\r\n     annual wages,                                         $13,584,000.00\r\n\r\n  Men employed in malt-houses; men 3,045; annual wages,      1,324,575.00\r\n\r\n  Men employed in the culture of barley, 10 men to every 100\r\n     acres; men 16,446; annual wages,                        4,844,000.00\r\n\r\n  Help employed in the culture of hops, 1 person to every 10\r\n     acres; persons 6,721; annual wages,                     2,016,630.00\r\n\r\n  All other adjuncts necessary as capital invested by architects,\r\n     builders, wagon and harness-makers, coppersmith, coopers,\r\n     machinists, etc., will amount to not less than,        60,000,000.00\r\n                                                          ---------------\r\n     Total,                                               $307,039,989.00\r\n\r\nA glance at the figures just quoted is enough to show that this branch\r\nof industry has become very important. Such a production implies\r\nthe contribution of a large amount of capital, and after careful\r\ninvestigation of the most trustworthy _data_ we find that there\r\nare more than three hundred million dollars invested in breweries,\r\nmalt-houses and other adjuncts of the manufacture of beer in the\r\nUnited States. The direct investment however, is not the only thing to\r\nbe considered. A business of this magnitude furnishes occupation not\r\nmerely to vast numbers of laborers, but also to thousands of men who\r\nfollow some profession or trade, such as architects, civil engineers,\r\nmasons, carpenters, coopers, coppersmiths, wagon and harness-makers,\r\nand the like.\r\n\r\nThe following table exhibits the production of the various states and\r\nterritories for the last year, together with the increase or decrease\r\nas compared with the previous year, and also the amount of brewers’\r\nmanufacturing tax collected:\r\n\r\n                                             BREWERS’ MFG.\r\n  NAME.

The stamps issued\r\nto brewers during the year indicate a sale of 9,473,361 barrels, put up\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n  In hogsheads,         1,140,361 barrels.\r\n  In barrels,           1,220,000    “\r\n  In half-barrels,      1,325,000    “\r\n  In quarter “          4,650,000    “\r\n  In third   “             71,000    “\r\n  In sixth   “            277,000    “\r\n  In eighth  “            790,000    “\r\n                        ---------\r\n                        9,473,361\r\n\r\nEnormous as the above figures may seem we are to remember that a great\r\nmajority of the breweries in the country have been erected within\r\nthe last fifteen years, and it is certain that no other branch of\r\nindustry can show equal progress during the same time. The following\r\ntables, showing the imports and exports of beer for the past few years,\r\ndemonstrate the strong position American beer is taking at home and\r\nabroad. The imports decrease. The exports increase, and this is the\r\nbest proof that our brewers produce an article which is equal if not\r\nsuperior to the foreign, and we have no doubt that with the help of\r\nwise laws they will soon be enabled to compete with those of any nation\r\nand thus not only enrich the coffers of the United States Treasury but\r\nadd in other ways to the welfare of our great country.\r\n\r\n  IMPORTATION OF FOREIGN BEER INTO THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n          Gallons.

In 1870 we exported 1,076 dozens, and in\r\n1878, 76,475 dozen! This trade has especially been encouraged by the\r\nPhiladelphia Centennial Exhibition, as it enabled us to show to the\r\nworld the quality of our production.\r\n\r\nThe gigantic establishments that, in many cases cover entire blocks,\r\nare monuments of very lucrative enterprise and ought to be the pride\r\nof the American people. The truth is, that, notwithstanding a yearly\r\nsale of more than 300,000,000 gallons, the consumption of beer is\r\nyet in its infancy. With an increasing number of persons it ceases\r\nto be a luxury and takes rank with the other articles of daily food.\r\nThe demand for it in all parts of the United States is increasing so\r\nrapidly that existing breweries are enlarged and improved, and new ones\r\nare springing up in every direction. In Appendices D, E and B will be\r\nfound a list of breweries in the United States with the names of the\r\nproprietors and the product of each, together with the total product by\r\nStates, as also the production _per capita_ in the various countries of\r\nEurope, the total production in the same countries, and the number of\r\nbreweries in each, and we trust that these tables will not only be of\r\nservice to the trade and to students of this question, but also serve\r\nto give some prominence to the men who have done much for the advance\r\nof genuine temperance and who deserve a more substantial recognition\r\nthan any it is in our power to give.\r\n\r\nAll this progress is a natural result of the actual benefits beer has\r\nbestowed on mankind, and these again follow logically and as might be\r\nexpected from its constitution, containing as it does a large portion\r\nof water from which all organic impurities are eliminated, a certain\r\nquantity of nutritive malt extract and a very small percentage of pure\r\nalcohol, obtained by fermentation and entirely free from the injurious\r\nproperties it acquires in distillation, together with some of the\r\ncarbonic acid gas so thoroughly approved by consumers of soda water. It\r\noffers to the public a beverage at once healthy, nutritious, and mildly\r\nstimulating, and as refreshing and exhilarating as tea, coffee or cocoa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOSEPH SCHLITZ BREWING COMPANY.\r\n\r\nHENRY UIHLEIN, ALFRED UIHLEIN, Sup^t.

PAGE 180.]\r\n\r\nThose who travel know very well the injurious effect of a change of\r\nwater. In no two districts are the waters alike, and we could point to\r\nmany instances where removal from East to West or from North to South\r\nand the consequent change of water has resulted in disastrous effects\r\nupon individuals. Any inconvenience of this sort would be diminished\r\nor altogether avoided by means of a free use of beer. Another similar\r\nadvantage of beer is mentioned by Joseph Coppinger in his work on\r\nbrewing, called “The American Practical Brewer, etc.,” published in\r\nNew York in 1815. After recommending new ale as a preventive and yeast\r\nas an antidote to malarial fever, he continues: “Brewing, in every\r\ncountry, whose soil and climate are congenial to the production of the\r\nraw materials, should be ranked among the first objects of its domestic\r\nand political economy. But a still more important consideration is the\r\nhealth and morals of our population, which appears to be essentially\r\nconnected with the progress of the brewing trade. In proof of this\r\nassertion, I will beg leave to state a well-known fact; which is,\r\nthat in proportion as the consumption of malt liquors have increased\r\nin towns, in that proportion has the health of our fellow-citizens\r\nimproved, and epidemics and intermittents become less frequent. In the\r\ncountry it is well known that those families who make frequent use of\r\ngood beer during the summer, are in general healthy, and preserve their\r\ncolor; whilst their less fortunate neighbors, who do not use beer at\r\nall, are devoured by fevers and intermittents. These facts will be\r\nless doubted when it is known that yeast, properly administered, has\r\nbeen found singularly successful in the cure of fevers.” The views\r\nthus expressed more than sixty years ago have recently received much\r\nattention and are now advocated by many eminent authorities who hold\r\nthat they are confirmed by both fact and theory.\r\n\r\nThe sum of the whole is that the beer brewing business has within\r\na short time increased immensely—and strictly on the more general\r\nrecognition of the merits of the product—and that there is every\r\nreason to anticipate at least an equal increase in the near future.\r\nBeer is already taking the place of ardent spirits and mixed drinks,\r\nand not long ago there appeared in the New York _Sun_ the complaint of\r\na bar-keeper who said in substance that the occupation of a skilled\r\ncompounder of fancy drinks was gone, for anybody could draw beer and\r\nbeer was what everybody wanted. Large gatherings now are more orderly\r\nthan a few years ago and the reason is to be found in the general use\r\nof beer instead of whisky. At Coney Island the proprietors speak of\r\nthe change as wonderful, and say that but for beer they could not get\r\non, while now a disorderly occurrence is rare, no matter how great the\r\nthrong. The same thing may be seen at the various races and in all such\r\ngreat assemblages of people who gather for enjoyment, and under the old\r\nregime were sure to become riotous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nCOMPARATIVE ADVANTAGES OF BEER OVER DISTILLED OR SPIRITUOUS LIQUORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe peculiar advantages of beer as a wholesome and refreshing beverage,\r\nas compared with either ardent spirits or water have never been so\r\nclearly displayed as in the late war between France and Germany—and\r\nit may with truth be asserted, that it has triumphantly withstood the\r\ntrial, and fully maintained its reputation.\r\n\r\nThe German military surgeons, in their official report to the Imperial\r\nmedical board, bear witness to the superiority of beer over wine. They\r\nnot only state that the refreshing quality of the carbonic acid gas\r\ncontained in beer makes it especially grateful to men fatigued by a\r\nlong march, or exhausted by a day’s fighting, but lay still greater\r\nstress on its usefulness in the hospital and ambulance, and say that\r\nwhen it could be obtained it was administered with great success as\r\na cordial, both to the wounded, and to convalescent soldiers placed\r\nfor the time under their care. They add the interesting fact, that\r\nthroughout that campaign the wounded invariably evinced a great longing\r\nfor beer and that when brought into hospital with shattered limbs or\r\nsevere cuts or gun-shot wounds, their first request was usually for a\r\nglass of beer. The same was true after severe operations, and the drink\r\nwas found to compose and fortify their unstrung nerves. The natural\r\ninclination to beer as a restorative was very conspicuous among the\r\nsoldiers who were on exposed outpost duty during the cold weather at\r\nthe time of the blockade and siege of Paris. The supply was scanty,\r\nand common soldiers did not hesitate to pay army followers a large\r\nprice for a glass containing only a few mouthfuls of beer. The report\r\nof the Director General of the medical staff of the Imperial army is\r\nin the same tone, and concludes with a strong recommendation not only\r\nto supply the soldiers with rations of beer instead of spirits when\r\nemployed on active duty, but also to introduce it as the usual beverage\r\nof the army in time of peace and when on home service.\r\n\r\nProfessor Moleschott, the distinguished physiologist, in his work\r\non the chemistry of food, treats of beer and makes the following\r\nstatements: “The weak alcoholic solution called beer contains nearly\r\nthe same proportion of albumen as is found in fruits, some sugar and\r\ngum, and another constituent which is composed of carbon, hydrogen and\r\noxygen, is soluble in water and is called the bitter principle of hops.\r\n* * * Fermented liquors, particularly lager beer taken in moderation,\r\nincrease the secretion of the digestive juices and promote the solution\r\nof the food, and further, a good lager beer partakes of all the\r\nadvantages of the alcoholic beverages and at the same time quenches\r\nthirst by the large amount of water it contains. Hence lager beer is\r\nparticularly adapted to satisfy the frequent thirst caused by physical\r\nexercise, and it is a laudable custom to refresh artisans who have to\r\nwork hard, with a glass of this beverage. Its albumen, equal to that of\r\nfruit, even supplies a direct substitute for food.”\r\n\r\nTo this we may add that a laborer who has repeatedly experienced its\r\ninvigorating property will by no means admit the truth of the assertion\r\nthat a half-pound loaf of bread and a pint of water are more supporting\r\nthan a pint of beer. A glass of good beer may often be better than food\r\nor physic. We do not always want food and we seldom need physic, but\r\na glass of beer is often a useful refreshment when the stomach is not\r\nprepared for the one and the system has no need of the other. Excessive\r\nphysical labor, long Endurance of hunger, or anything else which has a\r\ndebilitating influence, affects the appetite for solid food and unfits\r\nthe stomach for its reception. At such times beer has an excellent\r\neffect, both in affording some present refreshment and in preparing\r\nthe system for more substantial food—and no such advantage can be\r\nfound in the use of water, and nothing like an equivalent in that of\r\nardent spirits. Richmond Sheen, an eminent authority, says: “That beer\r\nis nutritive and salubrious cannot be doubted. It proves a refreshing\r\ndrink and an agreeable and valuable stimulus and support to those who\r\nhave to undergo much bodily fatigue.”\r\n\r\nIn cases of mental depression too, a glass of beer has often the same\r\ngood effect as food after physical exhaustion. On this point Professor\r\nT. K. Chambers of New York very justly says: “It is certain that the\r\nhabitual use of some stimulant, particularly beer, bestows on a large\r\nclass the nervous energy necessary to digest food enough to exist\r\nupon and get through other vital functions. By this stimulus they are\r\nenabled to be useful members of society instead of the mere drones they\r\nmust become during the rest of their existence under a total abstinence\r\nregime.”\r\n\r\nThe records of disease and the bills of mortality in beer-drinking\r\ncountries show longer lives and a less percentage of sickness than\r\nprevail where malt liquors are replaced by other beverages.[19] Not\r\nonly is this true but the social condition of the people is better\r\nin countries where beer is recognized and encouraged by government,\r\nand a very striking illustration of this truth may be found through a\r\ncomparison of the state of Maine and the kingdom of Bavaria. Bavaria\r\nis the most noted beer-drinking country on the globe and Maine is\r\ndistinctively known as the prohibitory state. The forms of government\r\nare radically different and an American naturally holds that the\r\nrepublican is superior to the monarchical, _i. e._, tends to promote\r\nthe greater happiness of the individual. Let us see what can be learned\r\nabout the matter, and first as to the terms of the comparison.\r\n\r\n[19] The Germans are the healthiest class of New Yorkers. Statistics\r\nshow that the mortality among them is nearly 38 per cent. less than\r\nthat of other citizens, while their increase by births is larger,\r\nand the same is found to be generally true of Germans all over this\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nThe advantages and disadvantages in the struggle for existence are\r\nabout equal in amount though naturally different in character. In\r\nBavaria, society is old, habits strong, the fetters of trade not easily\r\nbroken, untilled land scarce and the population dense. In Maine there\r\nis abundance of new land, much timber yet unconsumed, no limits on a\r\nchoice of occupation, a new society and a sparse population. The state\r\nhas a climate that stimulates to industry and the men pride themselves\r\non their strength and energy. In Bavaria few receive aid from the\r\nstate or the municipality; while in Maine, the records in this respect\r\nare frightful. Maine has in addition all the advantages that can be\r\nobtained by means of the most stringent prohibitory law ever devised,\r\na law that, according to its advocates, must tend to secure peace,\r\nprosperity and happiness. Which of these countries should have most\r\npaupers, men who are unable to find their own living and are supported\r\nat the cost of the state? As a matter of fact the number in Bavaria is\r\nvery small while the record of Maine is bad not merely in comparison\r\nwith the old monarchy but as set against that of the United States\r\nat large. The last census shows one pauper to every 171.65 of the\r\npopulation of Maine, while the pauper rate of the whole country was\r\nonly one in 502.47.\r\n\r\nAgain, the condition of Bavaria is such as favors emigration to a\r\nlarge extent, yet her population, in spite of it, increased 4.5 per\r\ncent. during the last census decade while that of Maine decreased\r\n.02 _per cent._ during the same time, and _Maine was the only state\r\nin the Union where a decrease occurred_. We have seen that in the\r\noriginal comparison the _pros_ and _cons_ were pretty equally balanced.\r\nThe difference is that Bavaria encourages the use of beer and Maine\r\nprohibits it. It must not, however, be supposed that the prohibitory\r\nlaw suppresses the sale of spirituous drinks. On this point abundant\r\nevidence will be shortly presented, and we need only say here that we\r\nknow on the best authority that “no one need go without his whisky in\r\nMaine, though a glass of beer is not to be had for love or money.” The\r\nreason is obvious, beer is bulky and difficult of concealment while\r\nspirits can be easily hidden. In this connection notice that in the\r\nUnited States between 1860 and 1870 the production of beer rose from\r\nsomething more than a million barrels to over eight million and that\r\nduring the same time the pauper rate decreased from one in 379.09 to\r\none in 502.47, a striking and very significant fact which may well be\r\ncommended to the attention of our legislators and others interested in\r\nthe connection between the proverbial thrift of the German emigrant\r\nhere and his indulgence in beer. The intellectual advance of the\r\nbeer-drinking countries is so notorious as to need no special comment\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nAt present a recapitulation of some characteristic national habits in\r\nthe matter of drinking, things well known to every one who has given\r\nthe subject attention, will serve both as a further illustration of the\r\nsuperiority of beer over other beverages and as a comment on what has\r\nbeen previously said of the modern history of beer-drinking in the more\r\nimportant civilized countries of the world.\r\n\r\nThe Scotchman drinks his “mountain dew,” a strong whisky containing\r\nover 54 per cent. of alcohol,—and Scotland has long been noted for\r\nintemperance. The Russian grows sullen and sluggish over his vadka\r\nor kwass, containing 52.68 _per cent._ of alcohol, and drunkenness\r\nand crime follow as natural results. The volatile Italians and\r\nSpaniards drink their mild wines as freely as their mothers’ milk and\r\ndo not disgrace themselves or become a nuisance to others by beastly\r\nintoxication. Frenchmen were formerly to be placed in the same category\r\nbut recent debates in the French Academy of medicine have developed the\r\nfact that in parts of France and in some Swiss cantons the powerful and\r\nseductive influence of brandy, absinthe and schnapps has diminished the\r\nconsumption of wine and gone far to undermine the health and morals\r\nof the people. The excitable Irishman drinks eagerly and rapidly his\r\nstrong whisky which contains more than 57 per cent. of pure alcohol\r\nand rouses all his combative qualities so that merry-making is almost\r\nsure to end in a fight, and trials of strength or skill which begin\r\nin good feeling end with broken heads and general tumult. The more\r\nsedate German drinks slowly, with much smoke and animated conversation,\r\na beer which has only about four _per cent._ of alcohol. He imbibes\r\ngreat quantities and may become merry or dull according to the length\r\nof his potations, but he rarely if ever fights. The Englishman drinks\r\nmuch in a solid matter-of-fact way, but is learning to substitute\r\nbeer for a great part of the stronger liquor he formerly consumed and\r\nbecoming temperate in the same ratio. The American Republic, though\r\nchiefly British in its origin and therefore inheriting a taste for\r\nstrong liquors, has become by immigration truly cosmopolitan, and is\r\non the high road to temperance secured by a general use of fermented\r\ndrinks. One great obstacle in the way is the wonderful variety\r\nof “fancy drinks,” whose names catch the ear as surely as their\r\ningredients tickle the palate. They entice young and old, seduce by\r\ntheir novelty or piquancy and carry many thousands on the straight\r\nroad to drunkenness and its accompanying moral and physical wreck. The\r\npractice of “treating” is also very common and very injurious. It leads\r\nto a hasty and immoderate consumption that has little or no regard to\r\nthe requirements of the individual and has by some been considered\r\nthe real foundation stone of a habit of intemperance. The Rev. Henry\r\nWard Beecher, in a recent address before the Business Men’s Society of\r\nBrooklyn, favored “moderation in drinking and total abstinence from\r\ntreating.” He said he never drank beer until he was sixty years old,\r\nafter which time he became fond of it, and evidently believed that its\r\nuse is a means to temperance for the people. There are many who might\r\nsay nearly the same thing. We are learning to appreciate malt drinks\r\nand the tendency is unmistakable, although it must be admitted that, on\r\nthe whole, the disposition of the people is, as yet, more nearly like\r\nthat of the Celt than the Teuton.\r\n\r\nMr. W. A. Lawrence of Waterville, N. Y., in a paper chiefly devoted\r\nto facts respecting the growth of hops, thus speaks of the general\r\nquestion—beer _versus_ whisky: “The fact is that the quality of beer,\r\nas a light and refreshing drink, has been wonderfully improved within\r\nthe past few years. A bottle of beer to-day has but about half the\r\nstrength of the beer of twenty years ago, and half the strength of\r\nordinary wine and cider. The beer of to-day is just what the American\r\npeople want—a cool, mildly refreshing, stimulating and palatable drink.\r\nWine is too expensive for a common drink. Cider is too sour and strong.\r\nWhisky is not a drink at all but a drug, and you have to take water\r\nafter it as you do after taking other drugs, and it ought to be kept in\r\na drug-store for sale and nowhere else. But beer is not only agreeable\r\nand refreshing and cheap, but it is mild, and generally peaceful and\r\ngood-humored in its effects. It is true a man can get drunk on it,\r\nbut a man won’t. A hog may, but most beer-drinkers are not hogs, but\r\nhard-working men who know what they want and what fills the bill, and\r\nif they wanted to get drunk they would drink whisky and get a good deal\r\nbigger drunk at less expense and in half the time.\r\n\r\n“The great majority of the beer-drinkers in America are these same\r\nhard-working men and women, who also drink beer with their food as we\r\nall do our tea and coffee. But in addition to these, who are mostly\r\nour German citizens, there are thousands of men, old Americans, who\r\nhave learned to love beer, who will drink it as long as they live and\r\nwill live the longer for drinking it. It is among the native Americans\r\nthat the demand for beer and hops is increasing. The Germans always\r\ndid drink for fifteen generations back, as much as they could hold,\r\nand in spite of all the theories of our anti-beer, total abstinence\r\nfriends, the Germans in Germany and in this country seem to be still\r\nabove ground; and so far as this country is concerned, as myself, an\r\nAmerican citizen, and the son of American ancestry for five generations\r\nback, I wish to God we could trade off about two millions of native\r\nAmerican whisky-drinkers now in the “solid South,” for two millions\r\nof hard-working Germans who would do their own work, and drink their\r\nown beer, and keep clear of fights and strikes and riots and greenback\r\nconventions, as they keep clear of them here in the North to-day.\r\n\r\n“Now everybody knows that whisky is full of the devil and that beer is\r\nfull of humor and good fellowship; and it can hardly fail to rejoice\r\nthe heart of every good hop-grower to find that in raising hops for\r\nbeer he is incidentally engaged in the great “temperance movement” of\r\nleading men away from bad whisky to good beer. I know this is not what\r\nthe professional temperance lecturers say, but what do I care what\r\nthey say? A temperance lecturer is generally a retired whisky drinker\r\nand can see snakes in everything, including beer. Or he is a clergyman\r\nand has acquired the habit of talking with no one to contradict him\r\nand hence is careless of his facts. Or he is a paid professional, and\r\nknows that if war is made on whisky alone, whisky would soon be driven\r\nto the drug-store and no more temperance lecturers needed or paid for.\r\nI do not hesitate to affirm that I know more about beer by experience\r\nand contact and study than the whole crowd of temperance lecturers put\r\ntogether. They ‘mean well’ to be sure; and so do I. The difference\r\nbetween us lies in the fact that they don’t know what they are talking\r\nabout, and I do, because I am personally familiar with something like\r\na thousand breweries in the United States and have peculiar advantages\r\nfor information.\r\n\r\n“And I am sick and tired of sitting in churches built by hops, whose\r\nclergymen’s salaries are paid by hops, whose congregations live by\r\nhops, and that is by beer at first or second hand, and there listening\r\nto wholesale denunciations of beer, and even to cold-blooded,\r\ncold-water propositions to pass a general United States law making it\r\nillegal to manufacture beer anywhere in the country. One hop-grower\r\nwho paid out over two thousand dollars to the poor women and children\r\nof one village last fall for picking hops, got up and left a church\r\nwhere some of this anti-beer nonsense was being aired, but as a general\r\nthing a man can talk against beer in a hop church with as little\r\nrestraint as a missionary to Greenland feels in preaching hell-fire to\r\nhis shivering congregation. The brewer is far away, and the connection\r\nbetween hops and beer is kept carefully out of sight. But to a carnal\r\nmind like mine it does seem a mean trick for a hop-grower to send out\r\na hop-dealer with a flag of truce to the brewers and sell him hops in\r\na friendly way, and meanwhile the hop-grower is lying in ambush behind\r\na stack of hop-poles, ready as soon as his hops are sold to blaze away\r\nat the brewer with a prohibition bullet or ballot. I believe there\r\nare very few hop-growers who are capable of such meanness as this,\r\nbut I do believe there are a great many who do not realize the close\r\nconnection between hops and beer, and to these I say respectfully, as\r\nI did two years ago in a prominent hop paper, ‘If you believe beer\r\nis a bad thing, plow up your hop-yards and put in corn and potatoes.\r\nIt is true that somebody may turn the corn and potatoes into whisky,\r\nbut that is not your fault. Corn and potatoes must be had for food.\r\nBut there is no such excuse as this in the case of hops. The hops are\r\nraised on purpose for beer. Not one bale in a hundred is used for\r\nyeast or medicine. Therefore you are the “outside man” of the brewery,\r\nand if beer is a fraud you are a party to a fraud, and you are not\r\nan honest man. We believe that the making of beer is an honest and\r\npraiseworthy occupation, no better and no worse than any other branch\r\nof manufacturing goods that are wanted either for use or pleasure.’\r\n\r\n“When I say we, I mean the men who believe in a radical distinction\r\nbetween fermented liquors and distilled. Such men as Rev. Dr. Howard\r\nCrosby, and Dr. William A. Hammond, formerly medical director of the\r\nUnited States army, and Dr. Willard Parker, the leading practicing\r\nphysician of New York, and a most earnest Christian man. Dr. Parker\r\nsays in the _Christian Union_: ‘Fermented liquor is the work of God;\r\ndistilled liquor is the work of man or the devil or both.’ ‘It is\r\nthe still that does the harm. It is the still that takes the alcohol\r\nout of its proper place in a liquid where it is not ordinarily found\r\nin a larger proportion than six or seven per cent., and where it\r\nrarely intoxicates, and never if taken in moderate quantities, and\r\nconcentrates it in a substance that is a deadly poison. Take away the\r\nstill and we should have peace and plenty on earth. We could then leave\r\nthe vinous liquors alone. I would compromise with all my heart on that\r\nground, and I would go to work and preach just as old Solomon did:\r\nDon’t use too much.’ If with such men as Crosby and Hammond and Parker\r\nyou believe beer should be distinguished from whisky, then go and raise\r\nyour hops; pick them clean and get clean money. Take your glass of beer\r\nlike an honest man when you feel it will do you good. Let it alone like\r\nan honest man when you think it will do you harm, just as you would a\r\ncup of coffee when you were bilious. Sign no pledges, nor encourage\r\nyour children to sign them, except those against distilled liquors.\r\nEncourage no temperance movement that does not move in the right\r\ndirection—against whisky and in favor of beer as a temperance drink; a\r\ndrink that is killing out whisky faster than whisky killed Ireland, a\r\ndrink that will build up the American constitution as it has built up\r\nthe German.”\r\n\r\nWe append tables showing the percentage of alcohol in a great variety\r\nof wines, spirits, malt and fermented liquors, according to analyses\r\nmade by Brande, Gerhardt, Liebig, Prof. A.

This product we have already seen to be\r\n9,473,361 barrels, which, on the basis just assumed, yields 521,034\r\nbarrels or 16,673,088 gallons of alcohol. Now according to statistics\r\nfrom the department at Washington the consumption of native spirits was\r\nin 1878 over 70,000,000 gallons containing about 37,000,000 gallons\r\nof alcohol. The cost of the native and foreign ardent spirits, wines\r\nand liquors used in one year reaches $500,000,000, and it is among the\r\ndrinkers of spirits that we find most of the pauperism and crime of the\r\ncountry. Those who drink beer use something that as far as alcohol is\r\nconcerned is more expensive than distilled liquors and yet spend less\r\nthan $120,000,000, as against the $500,000,000 above mentioned. It\r\nshould be noticed that while rum, gin, brandy, whisky, etc., contain\r\nover 50 per cent. of alcohol, ales never reach nine per cent., and\r\nlager beer seldom reaches six per cent. and is often below four.\r\n\r\nAn examination of these tables taken in connection with the other\r\nfacts mentioned should be sufficient to give a general idea of the\r\nnature and extent of the claims to be made in favor of beer as a common\r\nbeverage. Others will come to light in the course of our discussion,\r\nand particularly in the chapter entitled, “What Authorities Say,” in\r\nwhich are embodied the conclusions of some of the most noted scientific\r\ninvestigators of our time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n                 BEER BREWING A BENEFIT TO FARMERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus far we have been chiefly occupied with the sanitary and social\r\nadvantages that attend the general use of beer in a community, but\r\nthere is another phase of the question that is worth careful attention.\r\nBarley and hops are the foundation of beer and we propose to show in\r\nthis chapter some of the benefits that attend their cultivation for\r\nbrewing purposes and which are by no means confined to the cash price\r\nreceived from the brewer. They can be raised to good advantage when\r\nthere is no such home consumption, but the real possibilities of these\r\ncrops are only attained when there are breweries near at hand. How\r\nthis is true will be understood after an examination of the following\r\nstatistics.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of hops is in itself a more important industry than is\r\ngenerally supposed, but for the purpose of this chapter it is of so\r\nmuch less consequence than that of barley that it may be dismissed in\r\nvery few words. A few years ago our own production was not sufficient\r\nto supply the brewers, and in 1872 we paid in round numbers $785,525.00\r\nto foreign growers. The next year the import was $1,310,627.00 and\r\nin 1874 reached $1,303,686.00. Since that time the tide has turned\r\nand each of the past four years has shown an export to a considerable\r\namount, the figures taken in the order of the years being as follows:\r\n1875, $1,286,500.00; 1876, $1,348,521.00; 1877, $2,305,355.00; 1878,\r\n$2,152,873.00. The yearly consumption in this country is about\r\n30,000,000 pounds, which after having served their purpose in the\r\nbrewery, furnish an excellent manure, especially for potatoes.\r\n\r\nAccording to the last report of the United States Commissioner of\r\nAgriculture, there were in 1877, no less than 1,614,654 acres under\r\ncultivation with barley, and the product was 34,441,400 bushels\r\nat an average value of 70 cents a bushel, making a total value of\r\n$24,028,644.00 for the crop. The average yield to the acre was 21.3\r\nbushels, and the average value to the acre $14.91, as against $10.72\r\nfor hay, $9.54 for corn, $9.25 for oats, $8.87 for rye and $15.08 for\r\nwheat. Only three crops, potatoes, tobacco and wheat yielded a higher\r\nvalue to the acre, and only six, wheat, corn, potatoes, oats, hay and\r\ncotton had a greater total value. Again, the northern latitudes produce\r\nthe best barley and accordingly we find that in the six Eastern States,\r\nthe average value to the bushel was a little over 78 cents. In these\r\nstates the number of acres under cultivation was only 51,065, the\r\nproduct 986,900 bushels, the average value to the acre $15.11, being\r\nmore than that of any other crop except potatoes. Notwithstanding all\r\nthis, we do not even now raise enough for home consumption. The import\r\nof barley in 1877 was no less than 10,285,957 bushels at a value of\r\n$7,887,886.00 on which a duty of 20 cents per bushel was paid by the\r\nconsumer, in addition to charges for freight and commission, all of\r\nwhich could and should have been saved to our people. Nearly eight\r\nmillion dollars is too large a sum to neglect when it lies at our very\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ISRAEL PUTNAM,\r\n\r\n_The great American General, Brewer and Tavern Keeper at Brooklyn,\r\nConn._ (1718-1790.)\r\n\r\n_See Page 27._]\r\n\r\nWe have said that high latitudes are favorable to barley. It is chiefly\r\ngrown in the northern tier of states and in Canada, and a state\r\nlike Maine for instance would find immense advantage in an enlarged\r\nproduction of this crop even under existing conditions. But suppose the\r\nrestriction on brewing were removed, that instead of being crushed out\r\nby local law it were encouraged and fostered. It is not easy to compute\r\nthe material assistance such a course would be to the farming community\r\nand the state at large, and yet the direct gain would be small in\r\ncomparison with the incidental advantages. For the proper illustration\r\nof this point we must ask the reader to follow and keep in mind two\r\nseparate series of facts which we are about to present. The first\r\nstatistical and relating to the “refuse” of brewing establishments, and\r\nthe second general.\r\n\r\nThe breweries of the United States use annually about 30,000,000\r\nbushels of malt, which yields, according to A. Schwarz of New York,\r\n2½ per cent. or 750,000 bushels of “sprouts.” Now in estimating the\r\ncomparative value of different kinds of fodder according to the albumen\r\ncontained it is usual to take hay as the basis of comparison. Air-dried\r\nmeadow hay contains 7 per cent. of albumen. “Sprouts” contain from 24\r\nto 30 per cent., so that a hundred bushels of sprouts, weighing 1,200\r\npounds, are equal in value to 4,628 pounds of hay, and the annual\r\nproduct of sprouts as above stated to 34,710,000 pounds of hay. This\r\nsame 30,000,000 bushels of malt yields at least 35,000,000 bushels of\r\n“grains,” having a weight of 1,520,000,000 pounds, and from 4 to 5\r\nper cent. of albumen. Taking 4½ per cent. as the average, 100 pounds\r\nof grains have the same nutritive value as 64 pounds of hay and the\r\nvalue of the product reaches that of 973,241,000 pounds of hay. It is\r\na proved fact that cattle fed on grains give better milk than when any\r\nother fodder is used and this fact is specially appreciated in New York\r\nand New Jersey, where the grains and sprouts are largely used with\r\nmost excellent results. These products must by no means be confounded\r\nwith the “slops” from distilleries, which is utterly different in\r\ncharacter—_as indeed every product of the still seems to be tainted\r\nwith some portion of the curse that has always clung to spirituous\r\nliquors_.\r\n\r\nThe second and general consideration is this: The past agricultural\r\nhistory of New England shows a succession of specialties, each running\r\nits course until the advent of another which existing circumstances\r\nmade more profitable. The first was grain (except barley), then came\r\nwool, and then potatoes, while the last and most promising is dairy\r\nfarming. It is yet in its infancy but it is already important. One\r\nthing is sure, that farming on the old-fashioned plan has seen its day\r\nin New England. The natural advantages of the West enable it to raise\r\nand deliver many crops cheaper than they can be grown in the older part\r\nof the country, and under the influence of this competition Eastern\r\nfarmers have grown poorer and poorer unless they have taken up a\r\nspecialty or possessed some unusual natural advantages. We submit that\r\nthe combination of dairy farming with the growth of barley will, even\r\nunder the existing laws, prove very remunerative. The facts already\r\nadduced point directly to this conclusion. The figures show that barley\r\nis a profitable crop and that northern New England is well adapted to\r\nits growth. Moreover it thrives on a comparatively poor soil while most\r\nof the other natural products that rank high in value involve a large\r\nexpense for manure, and in many cases a great deal of hand labor. Dairy\r\nfarms are known to pay well. What then will be the result of combining\r\nthe two industries as above indicated on terms favorable to both? But\r\nthis can only be successfully done by the establishment of breweries,\r\nand sooner or later the people will understand all these facts and act\r\naccordingly. _Remove the laws that now make brewing impossible, and a\r\nnew industry will spring up as if by magic_—we might well say three\r\nnew industries—for barley culture and dairies will grow to keep pace\r\nwith the demands and the grants of brewing. For it must be remembered\r\nthat brewing is not like some other forms of manufacture. What it takes\r\nwith one hand it gives with the other. It receives the farmer’s grain\r\nand pays him a good price; it gives him valuable fodder and manure for\r\na sum that is small in proportion to the benefit conferred. It helps\r\nput in motion the wheels of another separate business, the manufacture\r\nof cheese and butter, and it is again the agricultural community who\r\nprofit by the development.\r\n\r\n_Living in an age of progress we must recognize the fact and adapt\r\nourselves to it or we shall inevitably fall behind, and we do not\r\nbelieve that the men of New England will long close their eyes to\r\nthe advantages offered by such a course as has been indicated. The\r\nchange must come, and sooner or later, a part of the change must be\r\nthe resolute and successful demand for a repeal of the laws that\r\nchoke industry. Maine men in especial have everything to gain. Their\r\nbusiness is stagnant, their population decreasing, poverty staring\r\nthem in the face and enforced idleness eating like a canker into their\r\nvery nature. They have it in their power to change all this, to become\r\nrich, revive trade, make the state famous for progressive energy, and\r\nbanish the intemperance that now accompanies and aggravates all their\r\nother ills and is accompanied by the other corrupting evils that, as\r\nexperience shows, always spring up in the shadow of a prohibitory law._\r\nThe matter well deserves more space than we can give, but we have\r\npresented the leading facts and must leave them for the examination\r\nand mature reflection of all who are interested. Great things have\r\nbeen expected of beet-root culture in Maine and other states, and we\r\ncannot close this chapter without a word in reference to this topic.\r\nThe Commissioner of Agriculture, in the prefatory remarks to his last\r\nReport, says: “The effort to produce a sugar beet, and the belief\r\nand expectation of many that the beet would be made to yield in this\r\ncountry as in Germany and France, of good quality, in sufficient\r\nabundance, and at a sufficiently low cost, to make it pay has not\r\nbeen realized—although no pains and money have been spared to insure\r\nsuccess.” The difficulty is that the sugar beet will not thrive on poor\r\nor exhausted soil, unless it is heavily manured. Such has been the\r\nconstant experience in those places where the experiment has received\r\nmost attention, _viz._, Chatsworth, Ill., Sauk county, Wis., and some\r\nparts of the state of Maine.[20] New England is unfit for beet-root\r\nculture, partly by nature and partly by the exhaustion of the soil,\r\nwhile on the other hand it is as we have said eminently adapted to\r\nbarley. Even had the expectations of the more reasonable part of\r\nthe beet-growers of Maine been realized, the material advantages to\r\nthe people would not have compared with those to be attained by the\r\nencouragement of breweries, the growth of barley and hops and the\r\nestablishment of dairies. All these things go together and stimulate\r\nother branches of industry. There will be more demand for other crops,\r\nparticularly hay and oats, and for lumber for vats, barrels, tubs and\r\nbuilding purposes. A busy temperate people must thrive _and we have\r\nshown what will make them busy and temperate_.\r\n\r\n[20] The state of Maine is assisting the experiment with beet-root by\r\ngranting a premium of one cent a pound on all beet-root sugar produced\r\nin the state, but even with this help the industry has failed to\r\nestablish itself to any considerable extent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n                 PROHIBITORY LAWS AND THEIR EFFECTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now reached a point at which we may properly recur to a\r\ntopic already suggested and inquire a little more carefully into the\r\nactual working of the prohibitory laws. On this head we shall confine\r\nourselves chiefly to the testimony of men who have made the matter a\r\nthorough study, and that not at a distance, but in the very midst of\r\nthe operation of such laws, and as Maine is the state which led the\r\nway in the prohibitory movement and has since followed that course\r\nwith most persistency, it is proper that it should occupy most of our\r\nattention during the inquiry.\r\n\r\nNot long ago a number of the most prominent men of the state, men of\r\ndifferent political parties, wholly above reproach, and especially\r\nfitted by official position or private observation to form a just\r\nopinion in the premises, became so well convinced of the evils of\r\nthe present system, and its detrimental effect on the people, as to\r\nunite in an effort for its amendment. Their movement took form in the\r\npresentation by Mr. Fox of Portland, a lawyer of high reputation and a\r\nmember of the Legislature, of the following proposed Act:\r\n\r\n\r\n                         “_State of Maine, 1879._\r\n\r\n  “An Act in relation to Cider, Native Wines, Ale, Porter, Lager Beer\r\n    and Malt Liquors.\r\n\r\n  “Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in\r\n  Legislature assembled, as follows:\r\n\r\n  “Cider, Native Wine, Ale, Porter, Lager Beer and other Malt Liquors,\r\n  when pure and unadulterated, shall not be considered intoxicating\r\n  liquors within the meaning of the laws of this State.”\r\n\r\nThe bill was referred to the Committee on Temperance and able arguments\r\nin its favor were made by Gen. Gorham, L. Boynton, Hon. Nathan Webb\r\nand C. G. Yeaton, all men highly respected by the people of the state,\r\nof the strictest integrity, and with no inducement to make other than\r\nan impartial statement. Three gentlemen who have successively held\r\nthe office of county attorney of Cumberland county for about fifteen\r\nyears past and who are all Republicans, have unanimously testified\r\nagainst the present prohibition law. They are Gen. Chas. T. Matlock,\r\nC. F. Libby, Esq., and Nathan Webb. Similar views are held by such men\r\nas Gen. W. S. Tilton of Logan Springs, Judge Goddard, postmaster of\r\nPortland, M. P. Frank of Portland, Speaker of the House, Dr. Edw. Dana\r\nand many other influential citizens. No party, however, was willing to\r\ngo to the people on this issue and the bill failed to pass, although\r\nthere is good reason to hope that when the next attempt is made some\r\nwho have previously upheld the present law will have learned to take a\r\ndifferent view. Much new light is constantly thrown on the influence of\r\nthe present statute, and can hardly fail to produce an adequate effect.\r\nA minority report of the committee was presented and contains so much\r\nof interest and importance that we cannot do better than to reproduce\r\nit in these pages. Its statements are those of men who understand the\r\nsubject of which they treat and are worth a careful reading.\r\n\r\n\r\n     REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON TEMPERANCE, OF THE FIFTY-EIGHTH\r\n                     LEGISLATURE OF MAINE, 1879.\r\n\r\n“The Committee on Temperance have listened to the able and exhaustive\r\narguments presented on both sides of the matter in hearing, and the\r\nminority of said committee respectfully present their views in dissent\r\nfrom the report of the majority. The law regulating the sale of\r\nintoxicating liquors, commonly known as the prohibitory liquor law has\r\nhad a trial of more than a quarter of a century. Its severity has no\r\nparallel in the laws of any other civilized country. Although enforced\r\nwith all the power of the state, court records show that the number of\r\nprosecutions and convictions is increasing, at great expense to the tax\r\npayers. Country towns pay their share for the enforcement of this law\r\nin cities without corresponding benefit to themselves. The cost of its\r\nexecution is a burden on an over-taxed people. A detailed statement\r\nwhich is hereto annexed shows the cost for officers to enforce the law.”\r\n\r\nThe details are here omitted but “the total reaches the enormous amount\r\nof $220,000. The records of the Insane Hospital show a gradual increase\r\nof patients caused by excessive use of intoxicating liquors. At the\r\npresent time that institution has nearly double the number of inmates\r\nfrom that cause alone, which it had when the present prohibitory\r\nlaw was enacted. While the law, with singular inconsistency, does\r\nnot recognize pure and beneficial kinds of intoxicating liquors as\r\nproperty when intended for sale by other than city or town agencies,\r\nand makes no distinction between the sale of adulterated liquors and\r\npure liquors, it authorizes their indiscriminate sale in numerous city\r\nand town agencies. Liquor-drinking is not done openly to so great an\r\nextent but the consumption is as large. It is notorious that quantities\r\nof strong liquors have for years been transported into the state from\r\nthe Provinces, and especially from Massachusetts, which has drained us\r\nof millions of dollars which might have been kept at home under liberal\r\nlaws. Liquor runners from New York and Boston penetrate every nook and\r\ncorner of our state to rob our people and eat out their substance.\r\nLiquors are also imported in bond, and under the protection of the\r\nFederal Government they cannot be seized in bulk. They are consumed in\r\nfamilies and in club-rooms which have been organized in large towns\r\nand cities, under that most dangerous guise of social drinking. The\r\nliquor agencies authorized by law have vended in some years more than a\r\nhundred thousand dollars worth of liquors for medicinal, mechanical and\r\nmanufacturing purposes only, as is supposed. We consider these liquor\r\nagencies as leeches upon the people. The question is whether a law,\r\nthe severity of which is without example, having failed to accomplish\r\nthe ends for which it was designed, according to experience and the\r\ntestimony of officials serving under it, who with singular unanimity\r\ngive their verdict against it, ought to be so amended that cider,\r\nnative wines, ale, porter and particularly lager beer, shall not be\r\nconsidered within the meaning of the statute.\r\n\r\n“History shows that every nation has its peculiar stimulants in\r\nstronger or milder forms. Men crave stimulant. It is an undeniable\r\nfact, both in the light of history and experience, that in countries\r\nlike Germany, France, etc., whose climate is not unlike ours,\r\ndrunkenness is known scarcely more than the strong liquors which cause\r\nit. Cheap light wines and nutritious malt beverages supersede strong\r\ndrink. Everybody uses them at his meals and as a common beverage. The\r\npeople of those countries are among the healthiest, happiest, most\r\nprosperous and temperate on the face of the globe. We appeal to the\r\nwisdom of this Legislature and the consideration of the people whether\r\nit would not promote the cause of temperance and the material welfare\r\nof our state to give the amendment proposed a fair trial. It would\r\ntend to promote harmony by removing an irritating and festering sore\r\nfrom our politics. Good citizens without distinctions of party view\r\nwith alarm the inroads that this law in its operation is working upon\r\nour social and material interest, driving away business, depreciating\r\nreal estate, shackling enterprise, cheating labor, increasing taxes,\r\neducating intolerance and hypocrisy, influencing elections and\r\nencouraging bribery and perjury and the clandestine compounding, sale\r\nand use of poisonous liquors.”\r\n\r\n                            DARIUS H. INGRAHAM of Portland.\r\n                            GORHAM L. BOYNTON of Bangor.\r\n                            F. B. FARREL of Van Buren.\r\n                            ARTHUR MOORE of Machiasport.\r\n\r\nThis is the statement of men whose characters stand so high as to give\r\ngreat weight to their opinion and leave nothing to be objected to their\r\nstatement of fact.\r\n\r\nAgain, Governor Garcelon is not a man to make hasty or unfounded\r\nstatements in an important matter and he has been for many years\r\nan eminent physician of large practice and a close observer of the\r\nhabits of the people. But read this summary of an address delivered\r\nby him before the Maine temperance convention: “He called attention\r\nto various kinds of intemperance, which have generally escaped the\r\nnotice of reformers in that state. He spoke of the use of tobacco as an\r\nincreasing evil, especially among the young, and said that in addition\r\nto chewing and smoking, snuff-dipping was becoming prevalent, a fact of\r\nwhich many are ignorant and which excites surprise. The use of opiates,\r\nGovernor Garcelon remarked, had increased to an alarming extent. Many\r\na man, he said, had appeared upon the stand advocating temperance,\r\nwho had in his pocket a bottle of laudanum or black drops, which pave\r\nthe way to an early grave. The ladies carry chloroform and ether to\r\nmoisten the handkerchief with which to allay nervous excitement. As a\r\npracticing physician and observer of human nature, he placed all these\r\nforms of intemperance in the same category with the intemperate use of\r\nspirituous liquors, all of which demand correction. Is the change from\r\nthe intoxicating liquors to opium an improvement? Governor Garcelon\r\nhas, undoubtedly, done the people a timely service by directing\r\nattention to this and other evils, and if followed up it will be found\r\nthat the ‘Maine Law’ has not been the grand instrument of reform which\r\nit is claimed to be.”\r\n\r\nAt a convention held at Bangor, Me., July 1, 1879, a resolution\r\nin favor of local option was presented by Mr. Charles F. Swett, a\r\nconsiderable part of whose speech is here reproduced, as it deals in\r\nfacts of great importance to the present discussion:\r\n\r\n“In supporting this measure, I wish to distinctly define my position.\r\nI am a practical temperance man; a total abstainer. I have belonged,\r\nand do now belong, to every temperance organization in the state\r\nof Maine, except the Reform Club. I have had much experience in\r\nendeavoring to ‘reclaim the fallen and save others from falling,’ and\r\nI therefore claim to be as conversant with the practical workings of\r\nour prohibitory law as any man in this hall, and I declare, from my\r\nexperience, that that law, so far as it contributes to lessening the\r\nevils of intemperance, is a complete failure, and a costly one to the\r\npeople of this state. * * * In Cumberland county there are four deputy\r\nsheriffs, whose business it is to enforce the liquor law. These men\r\nget from $7,000 to $9,000 per year for their services. Of course they\r\nnever reform a drunkard, but they can afford to contribute $3,000 a\r\nyear towards the campaign fund—and they do—and the people furnish the\r\nmoney. Every liquor-seller thrown into jail for sixty days pays the\r\nhigh sheriff a profit of $1.50 per week. When there is an average of\r\nsay fifty of these cases his profits will be $4,000 per year, from this\r\nsource alone. The people furnish the money, and the sheriff ‘comes down\r\nhandsomely’ for the campaign fund. True, there are no men reformed, but\r\nthe party gets the ‘sinews of war.’ And so it is all over the state.\r\n\r\n“The cost of the execution of the prohibitory law is a burden upon\r\nour over-taxed people. The report of the temperance committee of our\r\nlast Legislature showed that although the ‘law was enforced with\r\nall the power of the state,’ court records prove that the number of\r\nprosecutions is annually increasing, at great expense to the tax\r\npayers. From June 1, 1877, to June 1, 1878, the cost of enforcing\r\nthe prohibitory law, in Cumberland county alone, reached $28,000. In\r\nthe same ratio, applied to the population of the whole state, the\r\ncost reaches the enormous sum of $220,000, annually. But we would not\r\ncomplain of the expenditure even of this vast sum if the results were,\r\nin any degree satisfactory. But they are not. The advocates of the\r\nMaine law make bold claims, but their claims are not substantiated\r\nby the facts. Outside of Maine, and even in the back towns of this\r\nstate, remote from the cities, people are given to understand that\r\nliquor is not sold in Maine, and therefore there is less crime here\r\nthan formerly. Neal Dow says, ‘We have little crime here because we\r\nhave banished its cause.’ Let us look at the facts. In 1851, there\r\nwere 87 convicts in the state prison. We had then a population of\r\n584,000, while to-day it is probably 625,000. Last year’s state prison\r\nreport shows the number of convicts to be 206, while 69 more were\r\nserving in jail work-shops. So the number of convicts has increased,\r\n_under the prohibitory law_, over threefold, while our population has\r\nremained comparatively the same. Does that speak well for prohibition?\r\nNow, take the city of Portland. In 1856, there were 650 arrests\r\nfor drunkenness, in a population of 27,000. In 1876, twenty years\r\nlater, with a population of about 30,000, there were 1800 arrests for\r\ndrunkenness, and in no year of the last eight has the list fallen\r\nbelow 1,200. And this under a vigorous enforcement of the prohibitory\r\nlaw. Does that speak well for prohibition? During last week, over 200\r\nbarrels of liquor were brought into Portland, by the various railroads\r\nand steamboats, _for home consumption_. Does that speak well for\r\nprohibition?\r\n\r\n“The secret drinking in club-rooms in Portland is threefold that which\r\nformerly took place at open bars, while the traffic outside has been\r\ndriven into worse and worse hands every year, until it has, with a\r\nfew exceptions, been taken away from respectable men, whose interest\r\nit would be to conduct it with some show of decency, and given into\r\nthe undivided management and control of the low and criminal, so that\r\nwhile ‘the law is enforced with all the power of the state,’ the upper\r\nclasses get drunk at the club-rooms, and the lower classes get drunk\r\nat the shops in the slums. Does that speak well for prohibition? The\r\nvilest liquors possible to make are manufactured for the market in this\r\nstate, and even our state liquor agent could not, or did not, _keep\r\npure_ liquors even for medicinal purposes.\r\n\r\n“Private club-rooms have multiplied in Portland, under the operation of\r\nthe prohibitory law, (there being over 80 in that city at the present\r\ntime,) and our young men just starting out in life are exposed to all\r\nthe dangers of the drunkard’s life, and no law can stop them. In these\r\nclub-rooms, boys who would never go to saloons to get drunk, who would\r\nnever learn to gamble were it not for their club-room temptations,\r\nwho would, in short, grow up honest and respected citizens, are being\r\nruined every day. This evil ought to be remedied by prompt and decisive\r\naction. Fathers who love their sons; mothers who pray for their boys;\r\nsisters who mourn over their disgraced brothers; wives who weep over\r\nthe wreck of what were once good men and true husbands; citizens who\r\ncare for the good name and prosperity of their communities, ought to\r\nlabor to shut these accursed gates of hell! Let us commence the good\r\nwork by striving to repeal the prohibitory law, which is a positive\r\ndetriment to the cause of temperance, an incubus upon the mercantile\r\ninterests of Maine, and a curse to the young men of our cities.”\r\n\r\nIn Massachusetts we have very important testimony to the same effect, a\r\npart of which is very ably and carefully summarized in an article which\r\nwe insert here, retaining for convenience a portion at the beginning\r\nwhich might equally well be placed under a different heading:\r\n\r\n“The state Board of Health of Massachusetts, in the Tenth Annual\r\nReport, published in January, 1879, say, under the head of\r\n‘Intemperance’: ‘A more severe public judgment of drunkenness, in\r\nrecent times, has undoubtedly tended to very much decrease its\r\nprevalence; and it is generally believed that light German beer is\r\nused more and more each year, at least in our state, to the exclusion\r\nof stronger liquors—_a change which it is of course desirable to\r\nhasten by legislation, so far as that can be done, either by removal\r\nof restrictions on the sale of mild liquors, and heavily taxing the\r\nstronger spirits, or by any other just and proper means_.’ This is the\r\nreiterated public expression of men to whom the state of Massachusetts\r\nhas committed the general care for the health of her people. For the\r\nformer public utterance of this opinion the chairman of the Board, for\r\nyears past, has been most bitterly assailed by prohibitionists; but,\r\nundaunted by these intemperate and abusive attacks, the state Board of\r\nHealth confirm the statement of their honest conviction by repeating\r\nthe same, and embodying it in an important public document.\r\n\r\n“In harmony with this public expression of opinion by the state Board\r\nof Health, appears the action of the Committee on License of the Board\r\nof Aldermen of the city of Boston. In their report of September, 1878,\r\nto the City Council, this committee say: ‘It may be objected that the\r\ncommittee have been too liberal in their recommendations of the issue\r\nof licenses, but their experience has convinced them that the “lunch\r\nrooms,” established chiefly for the sale of lager beer and edible\r\nrefreshments, ought to be regarded as victualing saloons, even if\r\nfacilities are not maintained for regular meals, and no cooking is done\r\non the premises. The committee feel satisfied that the consumption of\r\nlager beer, now so general, tends, in fact, to exclude from sale and\r\nuse more ardent spirits, and thereby diminishes crime and pauperism.\r\nIt is well known that in the old countries, where beer and light wines\r\nare accessible, without restraint, at a small expense, and are freely\r\nused by all classes of people, cases of intoxication are very rare. The\r\ncommittee are confident that drunkenness, and consequently pauperism\r\nand crime, will be diminished in this state, if no restrictions were\r\nplaced on the sale of lager beer, for it then could be provided at such\r\na low price as to effectually supersede the use of strong liquors.\r\nThey therefore submit for the consideration of the City Council the\r\nfollowing order:\r\n\r\n“‘_Ordered_, That his Honor the Mayor be requested to petition the next\r\nLegislature for such amendment of chapter 99 of the statutes of 1875 as\r\nwill allow the sale of cider and lager beer without any license being\r\nrequired therefor.’\r\n\r\n“It must be admitted, that in the state of Massachusetts, the liquor\r\nquestion has been as fully discussed, and the various legal expedients\r\nconnected therewith have had as fair and full a trial as in any other\r\nstate in the Union. It may therefore be claimed, without presumption,\r\nthat to the results there attained, and the opinions there formed, when\r\ncoming from official and authentic sources, the careful consideration\r\nof other state governments should be given. Acting from this view, we\r\ndraw the attention of the reader to a very instructive report of the\r\nresults of an investigation relative to drunkenness and liquor selling\r\nunder prohibition and license legislation contained in the Tenth Annual\r\nReport of the Massachusetts Bureau of Statistics of Labor, issued as\r\na public document in January, 1879. This investigation was undertaken\r\nat the special request of Governor Rice, whose object was to place on\r\nrecord a statement, as a basis for an intelligent consideration of the\r\nquestion, of as reliable a character as could be secured by impartial\r\nstatistics. These statistics are drawn from official sources, and, as\r\nfar as the figures are concerned, are thoroughly reliable.\r\n\r\n“The years 1874 and 1877 were selected for comparison, because 1874\r\nrepresented the last full year under the operation of the prohibitory\r\nlaw, and 1877 the last full year under the license law. The advantages\r\nresulting from this selection of years, if any, are on the side of the\r\nprohibitory law, because that law, in 1874, had been in operation for a\r\nnumber of years, while the license law, in 1877, had only been in force\r\na year and a half.\r\n\r\n“Four circulars were prepared and addressed by the chief of the state\r\nBureau of Statistics and Labor to town clerks, city clerks, chiefs of\r\npolice, to standing justices, clerks of district, municipal and police\r\ncourts, and trial justices. These circulars solicited information\r\nregarding the sales of liquor, prosecutions therefor, and arrests and\r\nconvictions for drunkenness for the prohibitory year 1874 and the\r\nlicense year 1877. The completeness of the investigation may be seen\r\nfrom the following statement:\r\n\r\n“Circular ‘A’ was sent to 325 Town Clerks; 322 answered.\r\n\r\n“Circular ‘B’ was sent to 19 City Clerks; 19 answered.\r\n\r\n“Circular ‘C’ was sent to 19 Chiefs of Police; 19 answered.\r\n\r\n“Circular ‘D’ was sent to 132 Court and Trial Justices; 130 answered.\r\n\r\n“This is a total of 490 returns of 495 circulars of inquiry sent out.\r\nThere can be no question that the investigation was exhaustive, for\r\nthe few towns which did not answer are unimportant places. From the\r\ninformation thus obtained and tabulated in detail in the Report, the\r\nfollowing totals are derived:\r\n\r\n             ARRESTS FOR DRUNKENNESS.\r\n  Under the prohibitory law, 1874,            28,044\r\n  Under the license law, 1877,                20,657\r\n\r\n            CONVICTIONS FOR DRUNKENNESS.\r\n  Under the prohibitory law, 1874,            23,981\r\n  Under the license law, 1877,                17,862\r\n\r\n   NUMBER OF PLACES WHERE LIQUOR WAS ILLEGALLY SOLD.\r\n  Under the prohibitory law, 1874,             5,609\r\n\r\n      NUMBER OF PLACES LICENSED TO SELL LIQUOR.\r\n  Under the license law, 1877,                 5,273\r\n\r\n      JUDGMENTS ON COMPLAINTS FOR ILLEGAL SALES.\r\n  Under the prohibitory law, 1874,             3,644\r\n  Under the license law, 1877,                 1,693\r\n\r\n“It will thus be seen that the number of arrests for drunkenness under\r\nthe operation of the license law, during the year 1877, as compared to\r\nthe prohibitory year 1874, shows a decrease of fully twenty-five per\r\ncent. In the number of convictions for drunkenness the difference in\r\nfavor of the license year is at the same rate. The number of places\r\nwhere liquor was _illegally_ sold under the prohibitory law of 1874,\r\nwas larger by 336 than the number of places _licensed_ in 1877. It\r\nis evident from these returns that the prohibitory law has failed to\r\nprohibit, or even to regulate, the sale of liquor, while it is equally\r\napparent that the license law, as a legislative measure, not only\r\nregulates the sale of liquor, but decreases drunkenness.\r\n\r\n“A law, to be effective, must have the support of the people; the\r\nprohibitory law will never be thus supported, as common sense will\r\nteach that it is neither just nor judicious, to make somebody else than\r\nthe drunkard himself responsible for his failing; and is not just this\r\nthe questionable theory upon which prohibition is based?\r\n\r\n“The prohibitionists condemn the use of alcoholic beverages of every\r\nkind, as the prolific source of sin and vice. Nothing less than total\r\nabstinence finds favor with them. To them, the terms use and abuse\r\nhave no distinctive meaning, and their curse falls upon brewery and\r\ndistillery alike. It must be admitted that as long as alcoholic\r\nstimulants are used, intemperance will exist, and that the evil of\r\ndrunkenness will only disappear with their total suppression. In view\r\nof the actual state of social habits, and the position which alcoholic\r\nbeverages hold in civilized life, as now constituted, no sane person\r\nwill believe such a total suppression possible. There are no means by\r\nwhich a habit, transmitted from generation to generation, and forming\r\nso important an element in the development of the civilization of the\r\nhuman race, can be uprooted. Alcoholic stimulants once invented are\r\nnever again abandoned, and seem to be destined to co-exist with man.\r\nThe deplorable vice of drunkenness has always accompanied their use,\r\nand all attempts of rulers and philanthropists, the severest penalties\r\nand the sincerest compassion, have alike failed to suppress the evil.\r\nBut it does not follow that, because the temptation of excessive use is\r\ntoo strong for some to be resisted, the great mass of people, who can\r\nand do use these beverages in moderation, should be made responsible\r\nfor the weakness of the few. Nor does it follow that the intensity of\r\nthe temptation is to be regarded as an excuse for the drunkard. Excess\r\nin the gratification of a desire, however natural, to the injury of\r\nothers, is to be condemned morally and legally. Many actions of man,\r\nwhich the moral and legal code of society brands as a crime, and\r\npunishes as such, are the result of an inordinate gratification of\r\ninstinctive desires implanted by nature, upon the proper indulgence of\r\nwhich the very propagation and the happiness of the human race depends,\r\nas for example, the instinct of self-preservation, of procreation and\r\nof acquisition. The more civilization advances, the more moral and\r\nintellectual discernment governs natural impulse, the less excess\r\nin the use of alcoholic stimulants the world will see. The vice of\r\nintemperance prevails to a far greater extent among the ignorant and\r\nuneducated than among the cultured classes of society. The spread\r\nof culture and education will do far more for temperance than the\r\nindiscriminate prohibition of the sale of alcoholic stimulants and\r\nthe signing of pledges; it will divest the indulgence of the social\r\ncup of vulgarity, and will punish immoderation by social ostracism;\r\nby giving to the pleasure of exhilaration an ideal character, it\r\nwill make the vine and the hop the emblems of harmless enjoyment.\r\nA clearer perception thus establishes a standard of ethics, which\r\nrecognizes a proper gratification of the innate craving for enjoyment\r\nand exhilaration, as an essential to human happiness, but draws the\r\nline between what is permissible and what is not, between the becoming\r\nand the unbecoming. The craving for improvement of condition and for\r\nenjoyment is strongly developed in man—happily for him, for it is the\r\nvery spur that urges him on to the physical improvement which is the\r\nnecessary concomitant of mental advance. The love for exhilarating\r\nstimulants is but one phase of this craving. As such it is entitled\r\nto and has found recognition in our social laws, and the temperate\r\nuse of alcoholic beverages is sanctioned by a practice as wide-spread\r\nas civilization itself, and by all classes, whatever their station or\r\ncondition in life. Contravening legal statutes will always be found\r\neither wholly inoperative, or to fall far short of the intended effect.\r\nWhenever and wherever the temporary enforcement of a law prohibiting\r\nthe manufacture and sale of such beverages has taken place, the cure,\r\nas far as the suppression of stimulants is concerned, has generally\r\nproved worse than the disease.”\r\n\r\nThe following particulars, taken from the report under the title of\r\n“Nativity of Prisoners,” given by the Chief of the Police of Boston,\r\nbecome very interesting when considered in reference to the usual drink\r\nof the classes mentioned. The table shows first the number in Boston\r\nof Irish and Germans, the number of prisoners of each nation and the\r\npercentage of prisoners to the whole population:\r\n\r\n  ---------------+-------------+--------------+----------------\r\n                 |             |              | PERCENTAGE OF\r\n                 | POPULATION. |    NO. OF    |PRISONERS TO THE\r\n                 |             |  PRISONERS.  |  POPULATION.\r\n  ---------------+-------------+--------------+----------------\r\n    Irish        |   56,900    |    14,673    |    25.78\r\n    German       |    5,606    |       364    |     6.49\r\n  ---------------+-------------+--------------+----------------\r\n\r\nSimilar general results are found more or less marked wherever such\r\nlaws are in force. Druggists tell us that as a rule the consumption\r\nof opium in various forms from paregoric to laudanum has increased,\r\nbitters are more extensively used and in some places Scotch snuff for\r\n“dipping” has come into demand. The amount of opium annually imported\r\nis greater than that received by China a hundred years ago, and there\r\nis reason to suppose that many who are called reformed drunkards have\r\nadopted opium in some form and thus given themselves to a new bondage\r\nno whit better than the old. Notice that the increase in the sale\r\nof opium keeps pace in a very fair measure with the enforcement of\r\nprohibitory laws. One dealer in drugs in Hartford, Conn., recently\r\nadvertised for sale five thousand pounds of opium, certainly a good\r\ndose for the land of steady habits. In the state just mentioned both\r\nprohibition and “local option” laws have been tried and neither can\r\nbe considered a success. Under the present “local option” many towns\r\nwholly forbid the sale of spirituous and malt liquors, and this fact\r\nhas given great prominence to suits arising out of the sale of what is\r\ncalled Schenck beer, which is substantially lager beer. The courts at\r\nlast decided that this article is not intoxicating within the meaning\r\nof the act, and though the decision as to intoxicating quality is just,\r\nthe fact that this beer is allowed while lager beer under its own name\r\nis forbidden shows how great a part prejudice instead of reason has\r\nplayed in the contest. “Peripatetic gin mills” are increasing in about\r\nthe same ratio as “temperance societies” and “temperance detectives.”\r\nThose who pass by the name of temperance reformers seem in many cases\r\nto lose the sense of human charity and brotherly kindness, and little\r\nelse can be expected when we remember how often they are the slaves\r\nof this single idea and how in all ages of the world bigotry has been\r\nattended by cruelty. Before giving one striking instance of cruelty\r\nwhich it is to be hoped has since been sincerely regretted by all\r\nconcerned, we must reiterate that any law which every one knows to be\r\nconstantly violated brings law into disrespect and demoralizes the\r\ncommunity so far forth. The case to which reference was just made was\r\nmentioned in the New York _World_, and although other matters are added\r\nthe whole is of sufficient interest to bear reproduction. The article\r\nis as follows:\r\n\r\n“Some time last September an old lady by the name of Stack who kept a\r\nfarm at Northfield, Vt., sold two glasses of cider to a man by the name\r\nof Timothy Hogan, who informed against her and secured her conviction\r\nand a fine of $20 and expenses. In consideration of her age, sickness\r\nand poverty, she was allowed a short time to pay her fine, but not\r\nbeing prepared with the cash in January, she was arrested by Deputy\r\nSheriff Avery, and, notwithstanding the severity of the weather,\r\nhauled off to prison in an open sleigh to Montpelier insufficiently\r\nclad. While in confinement sickness and poor treatment combined caused\r\na rapid decline, until her niece, a domestic in a hotel, borrowed\r\nsufficient money to pay her fine and effect her release. Her death\r\nfollowed shortly afterward, caused, no doubt, by the treatment she\r\nhad received. This at the hand and in the cause of philanthropic\r\nreformers is bad enough, but worse remains. Here is a temperance man’s\r\ndescription of the system by which these reformers are guided, and\r\nwhich one of our conscientious judges in Connecticut not long since\r\ntruly denounced as infamous. The state referred to is the state of\r\nthe ‘Green Mountain Boys,’ and noble Ethan Allen—Vermont. The manner\r\nof prosecuting liquor cases is by what is known as the ‘spy system.’\r\nEvery informer who can secure the conviction of any person receives a\r\nportion of the fine imposed. A respectable justice of the municipal\r\ncourt in one of the most important towns in the state is authority for\r\nthe statement that there are certain justices of the peace who make\r\na special arrangement with these informers and come in for a share\r\nof the profits, so that outside of the merits of the case conviction\r\nis a foregone conclusion every time. The prohibitory law in force in\r\nthis state makes it a crime for a man to sell even a glass of cider.\r\nIn the past few weeks the _World_ correspondent has visited Rutland,\r\nBurlington, St. Albans, Montpelier and other towns in the state, and\r\nfound in every place that at the hotels and elsewhere liquor was sold\r\nand no questions asked. In this, as in every other state, where a\r\nsimilar law has been in force, people with money and influence can\r\nfreely engage in the traffic with none to molest or make them afraid.\r\nThe class of spies or informers who engage in the work of prosecuting\r\nliquor cases are the lowest people in the community. They are despised\r\nby everybody except fanatical temperance reformers, who employ and\r\nencourage them. A prominent citizen, who has held high office in the\r\nstate and is one of the substantial business men, said the other day:\r\n‘The result of the prohibitory law has been to honey-comb the social\r\ncommunity with hypocrisy and immorality. I have closely investigated\r\nthe course of events since this “temperance wave” has swept the state,\r\nand while drunkenness is not on the decrease other forms of immorality\r\nare certainly on the increase. I would not permit my daughter, or any\r\nrespectable young lady over whom I might have any influence, to even\r\nattend the evening meetings of these temperance societies, as I think\r\nit has been conclusively proved that they promote immorality.’ Such a\r\nstatement coming from an influential and respected citizen, who himself\r\npractices and inculcates temperance principles, shows the tendency of\r\nthe prohibitory movement in this state.”\r\n\r\nIt would be an easy matter to collect volumes of evidence on this\r\nquestion of the real effect of prohibitory laws, all going to show\r\nthat they do not prevent intemperance, that they do lead to the use of\r\nother stimulants, that they undermine the character of the community,\r\nand that, from whatever point of view regarded, they must be considered\r\nharmful to the individual and to the state. Enough, however, for our\r\npresent purpose and for the space at command has been already said.\r\nThose best informed will be most ready to say that the presentation\r\nabove given does not overstate, but rather falls short of displaying\r\nthe corruption that creeps in where a prohibitory law is in force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n                        WHAT AUTHORITIES SAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat shall we do to prevent the evils of a too free use of intoxicating\r\ndrinks, and to make our people truly temperate?\r\n\r\nThis question was ably discussed in the State Board of Health of\r\nMassachusetts some years ago, and Dr. Bowditch, the chairman of the\r\nboard, expressed himself at that time as follows: “I am confident that\r\nour people could be gradually led to a higher temperance by appeals to\r\ncommon sense while deprecating the evils of intemperance, by observing\r\nthat the use of some liquors is deleterious, while the temperate use of\r\nothers does little or no harm. I deem a love of stimulants as much a\r\nhuman instinct as any other of the so-called human instincts. And the\r\nproposition of total abstinence from stimulants because intoxication\r\nprevails widely in the community, seems to me as preposterous as\r\nit would be to advise universal celibacy because of the existence\r\nof gross evils in connection with those instincts that lead to the\r\ndivine institution of marriage. By classifying all liquors as equally\r\ninjurious, and by endeavoring to further that idea in the community,\r\nare we not doing a real injury to the country by preventing a free\r\nuse of lager beer instead of ardent spirits to which our people are\r\nso addicted? In the sincere belief, gentlemen, that this analysis of\r\nour correspondence will, eventually at least, tend to help onward the\r\nmost excellent cause of temperance everywhere, and in the hope that\r\nnone will be offended at the expression at times, of my own individual\r\nopinion, which in the course of the discussion I have deemed it my\r\nright and duty to give, I remain\r\n\r\n                            Your colleague and friend,\r\n\r\n                                    HENRY J. BOWDITCH,\r\n\r\n              _Chairman of the State Board of Health of Massachusetts._”\r\n\r\nIn his annual report to the State Board of Health, Dr. Bowditch said,\r\nspeaking of the question of temperance in connection with the use of\r\nlight wines and beer, “I fully agree with all that has been said of the\r\nvalue of light wines as an aid to temperance, but I sincerely believe\r\nthat Germans are destined to be really the greatest benefactors of this\r\ncountry by bringing to us—if we choose to accept the boon—their beer.\r\nLager beer contains less alcohol than any of the native or foreign\r\ngrape wines. This fact with the other fact that the Germans have not\r\nthe pernicious habits of our people, would if we chose to adopt their\r\ncustoms tend to diminish intemperance in this country. From the study I\r\nhave made, lager beer can be used freely without any apparent injury to\r\nthe individual, or without intoxication, and would be really a promoter\r\nof the temperance cause, and if we could so manage as to furnish the\r\npeople with lager beer and dispense with distilled or alcoholic liquors\r\nentirely, the community would be immensely benefited.” And on page 301\r\nin the same report, the Doctor properly said, “Whisky-drinkers are seen\r\nstaggering through the streets or lying insensible in some corner,\r\nwherever this beverage is used. But among the light wine tipplers and\r\nbeer-drinkers, even when drinking freely, drunkards are very seldom\r\nseen.”\r\n\r\nWe have previously shown that in many cases the introduction of beer\r\nhas added to the welfare of society, and that its use is perfectly\r\nconsistent with habits of sobriety and temperance. From this we\r\ndrew the inference that the production should be encouraged and its\r\nincrease hailed as a sure pledge of improvement in the matters of\r\ndrunkenness, disorder and crime. The same conclusion was reached by\r\nDr. Bowditch as the result of correspondence conducted with a view to\r\nascertaining fully the actual state of the case at home and abroad. He\r\ncaused a series of inquiries to be carefully prepared and forwarded\r\nto thirty-three resident American ambassadors and to one hundred and\r\nthirty-two consuls, also to many other men in private or official\r\npositions, whose statements and opinions would be entitled to respect.\r\nWhen the answers were received the unanimity of the opinions expressed\r\nwas almost startling. _All_ are in favor of beer as a light, wholesome\r\nbeverage, superior even to the light wines. Following are given a few\r\nextracts from the great mass of answers received:\r\n\r\nA physician in Massachusetts writes, “I should make a distinction\r\nbetween the use of intoxicating liquors and the lighter drinks. What\r\na blessing it would be for the community if we could furnish the\r\npeople with the best of lager beer and dispense with distilled liquors\r\nentirely.”\r\n\r\nAnother physician, also resident in Massachusetts, says, “I have had\r\na very large practice among the Germans for twenty years, and my\r\nobservation has been that they are remarkably free from consumption and\r\nchronic diseases. I have attributed it to their free use of lager beer,\r\nand do conscientiously believe that the moderate use of this beverage\r\nis beneficial.”\r\n\r\nA letter from the consulate general of the United States at\r\nFrankfort-on-the-Main, reads thus: “Twenty years ago the state of\r\naffairs in reference to temperance was different. By the improvement\r\nin making beer and the selling of it to the people at large, at low\r\nprices, things have changed wonderfully. Drunkards have disappeared. A\r\ngreat deal less of cider and wine is consumed. Everybody now generally\r\ndrinks beer. Intoxication has decreased. It cannot be said that the\r\ngeneral health of the people suffers in this part of Germany. In the\r\ncity of Frankfort, with a population of over one hundred thousand, and\r\nan average annual mortality of fifteen hundred, hardly five persons\r\non an average have died of delirium tremens, which all the eminent,\r\nphysicians here attribute to the free use of lager beer.”\r\n\r\nMr. John Jay of the United States Legation at Vienna says: “I am\r\nadvised by those in whose judgment I have full confidence, that the\r\nchief drinks in Austria are wine but particularly beer, the latter\r\nof which is drunk by all classes of society at home and at places of\r\namusement, and that but comparatively a small amount of spirituous\r\nliquors is consumed except in Galicia. Touching the relative amount of\r\nintoxication in the country where I am residing, and that seen all over\r\nthe United States, I do say that I have seen more intoxicated persons\r\nin the streets of New York in one day than I have chanced to see in\r\nVienna during the past year.”\r\n\r\nBaron Liebig, the eminent chemist, makes the following statements:\r\n“Beer unites in its composition a number of constituents whose action\r\nis such as to more or less completely neutralize the alcohol whose\r\ntendency is to exalt the function of the brain and nervous system.”\r\n\r\n“Fermented juices, in general, differ from spirits in containing\r\nalkalies, organic acids and certain other substances.”\r\n\r\n“Pure lager beer when taken with lean flesh and little bread yields a\r\ndiet approaching to milk, and with fat meat, approaching to rice or\r\npotatoes.” And in another place, “In beer-drinking countries, it is the\r\nuniversal medicine for the healthy as well as for the sick, and it is\r\nmilk to the aged.”\r\n\r\nDr. Schlaeger of Vienna, also a distinguished chemist, says:\r\n\r\n“It is my opinion, based on numerous cases that have come under my\r\nprofessional observation, that delirium tremens and other maladies\r\nto which inebriates are subject are caused chiefly by the use of\r\n_distilled liquors_. Therefore the manufacture and sale of beer should\r\nbe encouraged. It should be free from taxation in order that it may be\r\nplaced within the reach of all at a low price and thoroughly take the\r\nplace of ardent spirits.”\r\n\r\nThe editor of the Chicago _Tribune_, writing from Germany, says:\r\n“Drunkenness is so rare and infrequent that it may be said not to\r\nexist. I have traveled thousands of miles through Germany, in various\r\ndirections, visiting nearly all the chief cities, and have made\r\ndiligent inquiry of American consuls and other well-informed persons,\r\nand received but one answer everywhere, _viz._, no drunkenness among\r\nthe Germans; public sentiment would not tolerate it; the habits of the\r\ncountry are all against it. And what is the reason of this freedom from\r\ninebriation? It is the total absence of whisky and the substitution of\r\nlager beer.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM PENN’S HOUSE AND BREWERY IN PENNSBURY, BUCKS\r\nCOUNTY, PA. (See page 26.)]\r\n\r\nMr. Y. G. Hurd wrote to Mr. Bowditch in reference to the beer question\r\nand after referring to the records of the Essex police court and\r\nalluding to intemperance caused by ardent spirits, continued as\r\nfollows: “Of all our commitments 60 per cent. are directly traceable\r\nto drunkenness. Is the enforcement of a prohibitory or any other law\r\nalone to rid us of the monster? Were there only the pecuniary interest\r\nof the liquor traffic to meet, powerful as it is, the result would not,\r\nbe doubtful. But there are climatic influences, the universal desire\r\nfor stimulants, the education of our civilization for some centuries,\r\nsocial customs and hereditary tendencies, all tending in a greater or\r\nless degree to perpetuate the evil. * * * * * A visit to Chicago and my\r\nobservation there of the habits of the German population, first brought\r\nto my mind doubts that total abstinence will ever be an accomplished\r\nfact. I visited the beer gardens on Sunday to see how the Germans spend\r\nthe day. There was a band of music, a dance floor, rude seats and\r\ntables like our New England picnics, in a beautiful grove, and lager\r\nin such quantities as I had never conceived. Everybody, old and young,\r\ndrank and seemed to continue to drink during the afternoon. But lager\r\nwas the only beverage. No liquors, no drunkenness and no fights or\r\ndisorderly conduct. The young men and maidens were merry and danced,\r\nthe elder drank and talked with the gravity and dignity becoming to\r\nrespectable German citizens; the children sipped their glass of lager\r\nand gamboled on the grass, and all went home apparently sober, to\r\nresume without doubt, their usual avocations on the morrow. There were\r\nprobably two thousand persons taking their weekly recreation, and this\r\nwas only one of half a dozen similar places about the suburbs of the\r\ncity. Now if this had been an American or Irish congregation, and the\r\nbeverage the usual vile concoctions called whisky, gin and brandy,\r\nwould not the closing scenes of the afternoon have been very different?\r\nBroken heads, bloody noses, and the wayside strewn with the wrecks\r\nof humanity in beastly intoxication. I thought if we could be rid of\r\nthe grosser liquors—banish them, put them in the pale of dangerous\r\ndrugs to be only dispensed by the physician like other poisons, and\r\nsubstitute the lager of the Germans and the light wines of France and\r\n_our own country_—should we not be doing our best to exterminate the\r\ncurse of drunkenness? I expect we shall yet come to this conclusion.\r\nThe difficulty is that with the tastes of our people, lager and wines\r\nwill be, indeed, now are, a cover for the sale of the grosser liquors,\r\nand worse than all, these liquors are without exception, adulterated\r\nor poisonous. I have written at your request this somewhat candid\r\nstatement of my present views as briefly as possible.”\r\n\r\nA physician who has under his professional charge, a large institution\r\nfor the maintenance of aged persons, informs us that the demand for\r\nstimulus in the form of tea is a matter of constant observation, and\r\nhe moreover gives it as his opinion that from twenty to twenty-five\r\nper cent. of the whole number are _tea sots_, drinking tea regularly\r\nfrom four to six times a day and as much oftener as they can procure\r\nit. They show the effect of this over-stimulation by increased mental\r\nirritability, muscular tremors and a greater or less degree of\r\nsleeplessness. Another fact to the same purport has been communicated\r\nto us by a friend. A domestic in the family sometimes appeared\r\nintoxicated and as it was certain she could not get at any of the\r\nliquors generally considered intoxicating, the circumstance excited no\r\nlittle surprise and curiosity. At last the problem was solved by the\r\ndiscovery that she drank large quantities of the strongest tea. This it\r\nwill be seen is in exact conformity with the opinion of Mr. Gladstone\r\nas previously quoted, and more or less marked cases of the same nature\r\nhave doubtless been observed by many of our readers.\r\n\r\nA. Schwarz, Esq., of New York, the editor of “Der Americanische\r\nBierbrauer,” a man known in both hemispheres, as an able writer and\r\nchemical student, who by his life-long study in fermented beverages\r\nhas won for himself the thanks of every brewer, writes thus: “Among\r\nall drinks, as well those which nature furnishes in abundance as those\r\nwhich are produced by human skill, lager beer especially commends\r\nitself by its properties as an excellent beverage.\r\n\r\n“Milk contains nutritious substances (protein) and various salts.\r\n\r\n“Wine contains alcohol and small quantities of salts.\r\n\r\n“Mineral waters, which render such valuable service to the diseased\r\nhuman organism, contain carbonic acid and salt.\r\n\r\n“Coffee and tea contain volatile aromatic oils and alkaloids.\r\n\r\n“Strong spirituous liquors, as whisky, brandy, rum, arrack and gin,\r\ncontain only more or less alcohol, with some etherial oils.\r\n\r\n“The various popular so-called temperance drinks are distinguished only\r\nby their watery contents, which are flavored with sugar and extracts of\r\nplants and herbs to make them taste less insipid.\r\n\r\n“Beer contains protein, alcohol, salts and carbonic acid gas, and hence\r\npossesses nutritious, stimulating and refreshing properties.\r\n\r\n“It is not our intention to write a eulogy of beer. We will only state\r\nin its favor what cannot be denied by any man, be he a physician or a\r\nmechanic, a philosopher or a manufacturer, a chemist or an engineer, a\r\nwine-drinker or a temperance man.\r\n\r\n“We denote as extracts of beer those solid substances which are not,\r\nthrough the fermentation of the wort, transformed into volatile bodies,\r\nand therefore remain as a sediment after the evaporation of the beer.\r\nThis extract consists of malt sugar obtained by the mashing process, of\r\nalbumen contained in the malt and now dissolved, and of certain salts,\r\nespecially phosphoric salt, which were originally contained in the\r\nbarley, and have not been lost during the process of brewing.\r\n\r\n“The amount of the extract of beer mainly depends on the original\r\nconcentration of the wort and on that state of fermentation in which\r\nthe beer is consumed; it varies from three to eight per cent.\r\n\r\n“By virtue of its protein and its salts, it has a very nutritious\r\neffect upon the human organism, and though it does so in a less degree\r\nthan meat or bread, yet on account of the form of solution in which\r\nit appears in the beer, it is easier assimilated, _i. e._, it easily\r\nenters the organism and plays a prominent part in the formation of\r\nmilk, muscle, flesh and bones,—and the quantity of alcohol contained in\r\nbeer is so small and so much diluted with water, that it can produce\r\nintoxication only if consumed in a very great quantity, _i. e._, by an\r\nimmoderate use.”\r\n\r\nAn international congress has just been held in Paris on “Alcoholism,”\r\nand the Belgian delegate, Dr. Barella, constituted himself the\r\nchampion of beer. He contended that the consumption of spirits should\r\nbe discountenanced, because these beverages are harmful, and that\r\nthe consumption of beer should be encouraged, because it is a sound,\r\nwholesome and harmless drink. He pointed out that in countries where\r\nthe wines are good, and the beers agreeable and nutritive, much less\r\nspirits are consumed, and _vice versa_.\r\n\r\nFollowing is a summary of the points made in the report of Dr. Bowditch\r\npreviously quoted. They will be found useful and interesting, and\r\nthe whole document deserves the highest praise for thoroughness of\r\ninvestigation, caution of statement and fairness of spirit.\r\n\r\n1st. Stimulants are used everywhere, and at times abused, by savage and\r\nby civilized men. Consequently intoxication occurs all over the globe.\r\n\r\n2nd. This love of stimulants is one of the strongest instincts. It\r\ncannot be annihilated, but may be regulated by reason, by conscience,\r\nby education, or by law when it encroaches on the rights of others.\r\n\r\n3rd. Climatic law governs it, the tendency to indulge to intoxication\r\nbeing not only greater as we go from the heat of the equator towards\r\nthe north, but the character of that intoxication becoming more violent.\r\n\r\n4th. Owing to this cosmic law intemperance is very rare near the\r\nequator. It is there a social crime and a disgrace of the deepest dye.\r\nLicentiousness and gambling are small offenses compared with it. To\r\ncall a man a drunkard is the highest of insults. On the contrary at the\r\nnorth of 50° it is very frequent, is less of a disgrace and is by no\r\nmeans a social crime.\r\n\r\n5th. Intemperance causes little or no crime toward the equator. It is\r\nan almost constant cause of crime either directly or indirectly at the\r\nnorth above 50°.\r\n\r\n6th. Intemperance is modified by race as shown in the different\r\ntendencies to intoxication of different people.\r\n\r\n7th. Races are modified physically and morally by the kind of liquor\r\nthey use as proved by examination of the returns from Austria and\r\nSwitzerland.\r\n\r\n8th. Beer, native light grape wines and ardent spirits should not\r\nbe classed together, for they produce very different effects on the\r\nindividual and upon the race.\r\n\r\n9th. German beer and ale can be used even freely without any very\r\napparent injury to the individual, or without causing intoxication.\r\nThey contain very small percentages of alcohol (4 or 4.5 to 6.50 per\r\ncent.). Light grape wines, unfortified by an extra amount of alcohol,\r\ncan be drunk less freely but without apparent injury to the race, and\r\nwith exhilaration rather than drunkenness. Some writers think they do\r\nno harm but a real good if used moderately. They never produce the\r\nviolent crazy drunkenness, so noticeable from the use of the ardent\r\nspirits of the north. Ardent spirits, on the contrary, unless used very\r\nmoderately, and with great temperance, and with the determination to\r\nomit them as soon as the occasion has passed for their use, are almost\r\nalways injurious, if continued even moderately for any length of time,\r\nfor they gradually encroach on the vital powers. If used immoderately\r\nthey cause a beastly narcotism which makes the victim regardless of all\r\nthe amenities and even the decencies of life, or perhaps they render\r\nhim furiously crazy, so that he may murder his best friend.\r\n\r\n10th. Races may be educated to evil by bad laws, or by the introduction\r\nof bad habits. France and a small part of Switzerland are beginning to\r\nsuffer from the introduction of absinthe and other spirituous liquors.\r\nEspecially is this noticeable since the late Franco-German war.\r\n\r\n11th. A race, when it emigrates, carries its habits with it. For a time\r\nat least, those habits may override all climatic law.\r\n\r\n12th. England has thus overshadowed our whole country with its love\r\nof strong drinks, and with its habits of intoxication, as it has more\r\nrecently covered Ceylon, parts of the East and Australia.\r\n\r\n13th. This influence on our own country is greater now than it would\r\nhave been if our forefathers, the early settlers, had cultivated the\r\nvine, which would have been practicable, as seen by the examples of\r\nOhio and California, and from the fact that the whole of the United\r\nStates lies in the region of the earth’s surface suited to the grape\r\nculture.\r\n\r\n14th. If these early settlers had done this our nation would probably\r\nhave been more temperate, and a vast industry like that of France, of\r\nSpain and of Italy and Germany, in light native wines, would long ago\r\nhave sprung up.\r\n\r\n15th. The example set by California and Ohio[21] should be followed by\r\nthe whole country, where the vine can be grown. As a temperance measure\r\nit behooves every good citizen to promote that most desirable object.\r\nWe should also allow the light, unfortified wines of Europe to be\r\nintroduced free of duty instead of the large one now imposed. Instead\r\nof refusing the German lager beer, we should seek to have it introduced\r\ninto the present “grog shops” and thus substitute a comparatively\r\ninnoxious article for those potent liquors, which now bring disaster\r\nand death into so many families.\r\n\r\n[21] Ohio has already made very great progress in this direction, and\r\nits wines are lighter than those of California. [Author.]\r\n\r\n16th. The moral sense of the community should be aroused to the\r\nenormity of the evils flowing from keeping an open bar for the sale of\r\nardent spirits, while those for the sale of light wines and of lager\r\nbeer or ale should not be opposed, except for the sale to habitual\r\ndrunkards after due notice from friends. Sellers violating such law\r\nmight be compelled to support for a time the family of their victim.\r\n\r\n17th. The horrid nature of drunkenness should be impressed by every\r\nmeans in our power upon the moral sense of the people. The habitual\r\ndrunkard should be punished, or if he be a _dipsomaniac_, he should be\r\nplaced in an inebriate asylum for medical and moral treatment, until he\r\nhas gained sufficient self-respect to enable him to overcome his love\r\nof drink.\r\n\r\nWe give next an extract from an article written by Dr. Willard Parker,\r\nwhich article was printed March 20th, 1879, in the _Religious Herald_,\r\na temperance paper published at Hartford, Conn. Dr. Parker says:\r\n“We have never had a single case of an inebriate in the asylum at\r\nBinghamton, (N. Y.,) who came here from using fermented beverages, he\r\nmay have begun with them and gone on to other and stronger liquors,\r\nbut the mere fermented beverages did not make an inebriate of him;\r\n* * * and while men use simply fermented liquors with no more alcohol\r\nthan comes from their fermentation, drunkenness is but little known.”\r\nHe says also that fermentation is a process of nature which will\r\ncontinue to exist as long as there is sugar and starch. Fermentation\r\nis the work of omnipotence, not the work of man, it grows out of the\r\nvery constitution of things and is as truly a divine process as growth\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nProfessor Mulder of Amsterdam remarks in the preface to his “Chemistry\r\nof Beer,” page IV., “I dare say without exaggeration that we find\r\nunited in beer all the wholesome substances that are met separately\r\nin the various carbonic acid mineral waters, in wine and in bread,”\r\nand in reference to the alcoholic property of beer he says, page 461:\r\n“Many people are prejudicially influenced by the frequent misuse of\r\nalcoholic beverages and kept from reasoning honestly and truly as to\r\ntheir salubrious effects in a diluted form such as we find in beer. If\r\nwe consider the beneficial effects of good beer on the system we cannot\r\nhelp attributing a share in the result to the alcoholic element, even\r\nif it be held that alcohol has in itself no nutritive power.” The same\r\nopinion is held by Prof. Pittenkofer, the renowned and well-deserving\r\nchemist and hygienist, on the strength of numerous observations and\r\nresults of minute examination.\r\n\r\nProfessor Stahlschmied formerly at Berlin and at present at the royal\r\npolytechnic school at Aix-la-Chapelle, says in his work “Chemistry\r\nin reference to Fermentation,” page 255: “Up to the present time,\r\nexperiments on the nourishing properties of beer have not been\r\nsufficiently numerous to furnish definite conclusions. It is not so\r\nmuch the small amount of organic extract that is to be considered as\r\nthe ashes and phosphates which are here provided in a form easy of\r\nassimilation. In this respect beer is next to milk and furnishes an\r\naliment that is directly bone producing.” It is well known that beer\r\nis very commonly taken by nursing women on account of its nourishing\r\nand milk-producing qualities and the fact furnishes evidence from\r\nexperience to the same purport as the technical statement just quoted.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Department of Agriculture at Washington as far back\r\nas the year 1866 speaks as follows: “The intemperate use of beer is\r\nlike the intemperate use of anything detrimental to health, but a\r\nmoderate use of pure beer will aid digestion, quicken the powers of\r\nlife, and give elasticity to the body and mind and will not produce\r\nany of the terrible results named by fanatics and ignorant people. In\r\ncertain forms of dyspepsia it is a valuable assistant to other remedies\r\nand in some cases of debility requiring a mild tonic and gentle\r\nstimulant beer has been found of the greatest benefit.”\r\n\r\nTouching the nutritious properties of beer as compared with the grain\r\nfrom which it is made Professor Mulder says: “The food value of beer as\r\ncompared with grain is as one to fourteen, no account being made of the\r\nfood value of the alcohol contained in beer. The albumen value of beer\r\nas compared with grain is as one to six, the fat as one to seventy and\r\nthe chemical salts as one to twenty-five. On the whole, the latest and\r\nmost trustworthy results of scientific investigation go to show that a\r\nwell brewed beer, properly compounded with hops and well matured, is to\r\nbe considered a beverage which has a most beneficial influence on the\r\ntransmutation of substances in the human body; if moderately taken.”\r\n\r\nSir Henry Labouchere, editor of “Truth” and formerly member of\r\nParliament for Windsor and Middlesex, an accomplished linguist, and\r\nfitted both as an original thinker and by experience in the diplomatic\r\n_corps_ at most of the capitals of Europe, to form a just opinion, says\r\nthat experience shows that beer is a most wholesome beverage, that when\r\npure it is not intoxicating and can be drunk freely, that its use adds\r\nto the health and strength of man, that intoxication hardly exists\r\nwhere it is the national beverage and that its introduction in all\r\nparts of the world would be a blessing to mankind.\r\n\r\nProfessors Ure and Huxley, Dr. Harvey, Dr. Abercrombie and Bayard\r\nTaylor, the celebrated traveler and recent ambassador at the court at\r\nBerlin, as also our great statesman and historian George Bancroft,\r\nall came, after careful study and personal observation, to the same\r\nconclusion, that beer is not only healthy, refreshing and enlivening\r\nas a beverage, but also an excellent means of rooting out the love of\r\nstrong drink and securing genuine temperance.\r\n\r\nDr. A. Baer, member of the Royal Sanitary Council, and chief physician\r\nat the prisons of Berlin and Ploetzensee near Berlin has, within\r\na few months, published a valuable work on alcoholism. He says,\r\n“Beer is of all drinks best adapted for a stimulating beverage of\r\ngeneral consumption. It combines with the refreshing, animating and\r\nthirst-quenching elements, distinct nutritive qualities, mainly due\r\nto the abundant presence of certain salts, and thus becomes one of\r\nthe very best substitutes for extract of meat. The greater number of\r\ncharacteristic principles of the one are found in the other, but the\r\ndecided nervous animation experienced after drinking beer is chiefly\r\ndue to the large portion of phosphate of potassa, which _Mitcherlich_\r\nsays forms 20 parts in 100 of beer ashes, and which, according to\r\nRanke, constitutes the principal active ingredient in meat broth. To\r\nthe presence of this salt, beer owes its strengthening influence during\r\nconvalescence and in cases of general debility, and its marked tendency\r\nto produce corpulency, as shown in beer-drinkers. In addition to this\r\nthe bitter principle of the hops has a tonic power of marked value in\r\nassisting digestion while the modicum of alcohol has a stimulating and\r\nanimating effect on the brain. On the whole, beer as a beverage cannot\r\nbe excelled, as it possesses a number of qualities which jointly have a\r\nmost salutary effect upon the human organism.”\r\n\r\nIn a report presented a short time ago to the Industrial Society of\r\nMulhouse the well-known Dr. Schoellamer thus speaks of beer:\r\n\r\n“Beer is one of the best drinks that we can recommend, its consumption\r\nbeing most wholesome. Good beer ought to be regarded as an excellent\r\ndrink, capable in itself of replacing all other fermented drinks. Thus\r\nits moderate consumption must be strongly recommended. If its price is\r\nhigh a great obstacle is placed in the way of a natural consumption.\r\n\r\n“Beer contains from two to eight per cent. of alcohol, a dose of\r\ncarbonic acid equal to three or four times its volume; when it is\r\nexposed to the air it loses all its gas. It contains besides azote and\r\nphosphates; for example, a liter of good beer, made exclusively with\r\nhops and barley, contains 0.80 gr. of azote, which corresponds to 5.26\r\ngrains of albuminoid matters. There are again from 0.60 gr. to 0.80 gr.\r\nof phosphoric acid, that is as much as in 530 grammes of meat or 220\r\ngrammes of bread. The solid extract of beer contains salts favorable to\r\nnutrition, etc. It is on these accounts that beer may be considered a\r\nbeverage of the first order.\r\n\r\n“It slacks thirst admirably, and as it contains a great deal of water\r\nit is perhaps the best of all for that purpose. As an alcoholic drink\r\nit is superior to all spirituous liquors. It is the most tonic, the\r\nmost operative, and the most nourishing. Complete drunkenness is almost\r\nimpossible with ordinary beer, whatever quantity may be consumed; what\r\nis known as “alcoholism” is not produced by it. In fact beer exercises\r\non the human economy a tonic, nutritive, diuretic, and slightly\r\nstupefying action, the last effect being due to the essential oil\r\ncontained in the hops, but large quantities must be absorbed before\r\nthis effect can be produced.”\r\n\r\nProfessor W. Nasse, president of the Society of Medical Officers of\r\nInsane Asylums in Germany, presented for consideration at their annual\r\nmeeting held at Hamburg, Sept. 17, 1876, the following question: “How\r\ncan we specially assist in preventing the injury which results from\r\nthe use of alcoholic liquors?” It was decided that the only means was\r\nin promoting the use of good mild beer. The same opinion has been\r\nexpressed by Dr. Selman in an address delivered at Dusseldorf, and also\r\nby Dr. Roller of Illenau, a meritorious specialist in mental diseases,\r\nand by Professors Griesinger of Zurich and Schreiber-Berzelius of\r\nSweden. All the authorities just quoted hold a high rank in their\r\nprofession, and contributions from their pens frequently appear in the\r\n_Quarterly Journal of Inebriety_, published at Hartford, Conn.\r\n\r\nThe Contemporary Review has lately published a series of papers on the\r\nsame topic, written in a popular style by several London physicians of\r\ncelebrity, including Dr. Walter Moxon, Sir James Paget and others, and\r\nall opposing the doctrine of total abstinence and declaring themselves\r\nin favor of beer as a promotive of the real temperance cause. Dr.\r\nAlbert T. Bernays, too, has considered with great minuteness the cause\r\nof intemperance and his conclusion is that beer is the safest kind of\r\nalcohol and should be adopted as a common beverage by all classes of\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nIn the Minnesota Legislature when the prohibitory law was under\r\nconsideration, Dr. Riley, a representative from Houston county, spoke\r\nas follows: “In the district where I reside there is a large number of\r\nGermans who have come from the old country and planted grapes, and now\r\nthere are magnificent vineyards stretching along the hillsides where\r\nformerly there was not grass enough to feed a sheep. They raise large\r\nquantities of very fine grapes which they ship all over the country.\r\nThey also make very fine wine. The proposed law will destroy these\r\nvineyards of my constituents. * * * Perhaps it will be necessary to\r\npass a law to protect those miserable drunkards who cannot protect\r\nthemselves but it is not necessary to restrain others of their liberty\r\nto drink when they want or need it.\r\n\r\n“Why, I have seen ladies at a tea-party, perhaps not drunk, but\r\ncertainly very jolly from drinking tea, and yet they come to this\r\nLegislature with petitions signed by all whom they could influence\r\nor bulldoze into signing, men, women or children to the number of\r\nten thousand. There are eight hundred thousand people in Minnesota,\r\nand we are proposing to let these ten thousand override the other\r\nseven hundred and ninety thousand. They claim as prohibitionists that\r\ndrinking tends to impoverish the people. Do you believe that? Look at\r\nthe Germans! Many of them take a piece of land that would scarcely\r\nsupport a hog and make a fortune of it. They all drink beer. They take\r\ntheir wives and their children to the beer garden and sit down and\r\ndrink their beer every day, and even the babe in arms will stretch\r\nto get a taste of it. These people are not impoverished by it. These\r\npeople are so healthy in my neighborhood that I have actually not been\r\nable to make a living out of my German constituents.\r\n\r\n“They say it tends to the degeneration of the human race. How does it\r\nhappen that in New England where prohibitory laws are in force the\r\nrace has so degenerated that they do not seem to be able to raise any\r\nchildren? Look at the Germans who drink beer all the time. You will\r\nfind a large family of healthy children in almost every German house.\r\nAre they degenerated?\r\n\r\n“The children of total abstinence people are constantly dying. From the\r\nvital statistics of Minnesota I learn that over two thousand children\r\ndied last year under two years of age. They would not have died if they\r\nhad been fed on good wholesome beer. I would advise mothers—and I have\r\nadvised them in my practice—to give their sickly children plenty of\r\nbeer, and I know I have saved many an infant’s life. Beer is the best\r\ncure for dyspepsia in the world. I have cured women of this terrible\r\ndisease by advising them to drink three glasses of beer every day, and\r\nI say again to you mothers that if you will drink beer and feed your\r\nchildren on beer you will raise more and healthier children.\r\n\r\n“Referring to the vital statistics of the state, I find that but six\r\nmen died of intemperance during last year—two of delirium tremens and\r\nfour of something else, which they couldn’t tell anything about, and\r\nso called it intemperance. And yet you want to stop drinking. Eleven\r\nwere killed by horses during the same time. Why don’t you abolish\r\nhorses—never use them or go near them? Thirty-five committed suicide.\r\nWhy don’t you prohibit the use of firearms and knives, and drain all\r\nyour lakes and rivers for fear some poor fool will drown himself? Some\r\n152 died of heart disease. I don’t want any heart in mine. Twenty\r\nladies were scalded to death. You ought to prohibit the use of hot\r\nwater for fear that more ladies will get into it and perish.\r\n\r\n“England away across the sea has brewed beer for many hundred years and\r\nwill continue to brew for thousands of years more, and to the fact that\r\nthe English people have drunk beer all that time I do conscientiously\r\nattribute her present greatness. Beer-drinkers are slow but sure. Look\r\nat Germany, that great nation. We could not pay her for the money we\r\nhave borrowed of her. Her great army, the best in the world, her great\r\nstatesmen, her philosophers, were all raised on beer.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fred Lauer_\r\n\r\nHONORARY PRESIDENT UNITED STATES BREWERS’ ASSOCIATION]\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Frederick Lauer in a speech before the Brewers’ Convention at\r\nSt. Louis, June 4, 1879, thus presents a phase of the beer question\r\nwhich is certainly of importance:\r\n\r\n“What we now want to ensure the future happiness and prosperity\r\nof the country is the enactment of liberal laws to induce the\r\nindustrious classes of overcrowded Europe to flock to our shores.\r\nWe want immigration for the purpose of building up our towns and\r\ncities, developing our manufacturing enterprises, and cultivating the\r\nmillions of fertile acres in this country now lying idle. The thrifty\r\nGerman is accustomed to his daily ration of beer. In the land of his\r\nnativity he has his parks and public gardens, where family unions\r\nand social gatherings take place amid the ecstatic influence of the\r\nfoaming lager. The English, Irish, Scotch, and people of other European\r\ncountries are noted patrons of malt liquors. The greatest liberality\r\nshould, therefore, be shown them in the indulgence in their customary\r\nbeverages in the land of their adoption. With the more general use of\r\nmalt liquors the hundreds of quack medicines now in the market will\r\ndisappear, as it has been proved by experience in countries where malt\r\nbeverages are the popular drink, that health and longevity are marked\r\nfeatures, and dyspepsia and chronic complaints are rare. The tide of\r\nemigration is again swelling to this country. According to the _New\r\nYork Herald_ of the first of May last, the total number of immigrants\r\nlanded at New York for the first three months of 1879 was 11,288, more\r\nthan two-thirds of whom came from Germany, England and Ireland. The\r\nemigration of aliens to the United States from 1789 to 1877 is set down\r\nin round numbers at 10,000,000, who, with their descendants have built\r\nup this great nation. Since May 5, 1847, the emigration to this country\r\nhas reached 5,732,183 souls. In view of these facts nothing should be\r\ndone to interfere with the happiness of those who seek our shores, but\r\nby means of wise laws they should be protected in the enjoyment of\r\ntheir rights and privileges. To be successful as a government we should\r\ninvite immigration, and develop our great natural resources, and then\r\nby promoting health and temperate habits by the adoption of beer as the\r\nnational beverage, we will increase as a nation, and be in truth and in\r\nfact the greatest country on the face of the earth.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n                             CONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing pages it has been impossible to give a hundredth part\r\nof the evidence that lies ready at hand in this matter of the use and\r\neffects of beer, but we have endeavored, by careful selection, to\r\npresent such as must have weight with all readers. Nothing has been\r\nstated as a fact which cannot be amply corroborated, and no inference\r\ndrawn that did not seem to be fully warranted by the premises. It has\r\nbeen shown that beer is wholesome, and so mildly alcoholic as to make\r\ndrunkenness from its use very uncommon. A man who drinks in order to\r\nbecome intoxicated, can, no doubt, accomplish his purpose with beer;\r\nbut such men are almost unknown where beer is the common beverage.\r\nThis abnormal impulse usually comes only in consequence of a course of\r\nardent spirits.\r\n\r\nThe evidence as to the cure of intemperance by the introduction of a\r\nfree use of beer is especially important, and one of the most striking\r\ninstances of such success is to be found in the case of Denmark, to\r\nwhich we desire again to call special attention. This is the central\r\npoint of the whole question. Heartily desiring the progress of genuine\r\ntemperance, and fully believing that all efforts in the direction of\r\nprohibition are false in theory and injurious in practice, that they\r\ndo not prevent intemperance and do produce many other evils, we hold\r\nthat the safe and only course is to popularize the use of beer, and\r\ncannot doubt that government would do well to foster its manufacture\r\nin every practicable way, and that taxation on the product should\r\nbe abolished, or at least made very light. Such a course would not\r\nmerely secure the very end which has been unsuccessfully attempted by\r\nprohibitory laws, but it would do much more. It would diminish the poor\r\nrates, save the money spent in prosecutions, which, after all, do no\r\nreal good, and incidentally improve the whole business condition. Some\r\nrefreshing, stimulating drink the people will have, and legislators\r\nshould seek to guide the instinct, not eradicate it. Men of the highest\r\nscientific authority have again and again pronounced beer to be not\r\nmerely harmless, but beneficial. Experience in the countries where it\r\nis most used develops the same result, and the readiness with which it\r\nis adopted in place of ardent spirits, whenever it is of good quality\r\nand low price, shows how easily the experiment of temperance on this\r\nbasis can be tried. Even advocates of total abstinence must admit\r\nthat beer is better than whisky. The fact that it adds greatly to the\r\nenjoyment of a people must not be ignored. Here in America we are apt\r\nto forget all but the work-a-day part of life, but the demand for\r\nrecreation exists and must be gratified in some way, and almost always\r\nrecreation is social, and is made more enjoyable and cheerful by some\r\nmild stimulant. It refreshes and enlivens, and so contributes directly\r\nto the social happiness that is the object sought.\r\n\r\nIt is to be hoped that legislators in general will soon learn to take\r\nbroader views than seem generally to have prevailed in the past.\r\nStatesmanship is not bounded by the views of one or the other party\r\nand is affected by no popular clamor. It does not enact a law because\r\nit is loudly demanded by a certain set of persons, especially if these\r\npersons have a hobby to ride, no matter how earnestly they may believe\r\nin it. A statesman will see for instance in this temperance question,\r\nthat the stay of drunkenness must be through a social change. Legal\r\nprohibition can do little while all the other conditions of the problem\r\nremain unchanged. Something must be given for what is forbidden. If\r\nbeer is encouraged ardent spirits can be driven out, and when this idea\r\nis once thoroughly understood and put in practice we shall have the\r\ntemperance era, so long expected and so ardently desired.\r\n\r\nThere is another subject which we approach with some reluctance,\r\nknowing that however carefully our words may be weighed, there is\r\na large number of estimable individuals throughout the country and\r\nparticularly in the Eastern states, to whom they will probably give\r\noffense. We allude to what is called the Sunday question, and the topic\r\nis treated here because in this country beer drinking is, in the common\r\nmind, intimately associated with the German Americans and their custom\r\nof spending part of Sunday in recreation in a beer garden. The fact\r\nthat they do so has been more than once used as an argument against\r\nthem and against the use of beer, as if there were any real connection\r\nbetween the character of the drink and such a custom on the part of its\r\ngreatest consumers even supposing the custom to be actually harmful or\r\nimmoral. As such a feeling exists, however, it seems worth while to\r\ncall attention to the fact that what is known as the New England Sunday\r\nis not an essential part of Christianity as so many honestly suppose,\r\nbut something that in comparison with Christianity is new and local. We\r\nneed hardly say that in the early days of the church it was distinctly\r\ntaught that the time of the Jewish sabbath was past and for several\r\nhundred years this view was generally held. Notice the following\r\npassages from the New Testament:\r\n\r\n  “The law and the prophets were until John. * * Old things are passed\r\n  away; behold all things are become new. * * Brethren ye have been\r\n  called unto liberty; only use not that liberty for an occasion to the\r\n  flesh, but by love serve one another. For all the law is fulfilled in\r\n  one word, even in this: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. * *\r\n  Love worketh no ill to his neighbor.\r\n\r\n  “If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is\r\n  perfected in us. * * For love is of God; and every one that loveth is\r\n  born of God and knoweth God. He that loveth not, knoweth not God; for\r\n  God is love. * * But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and\r\n  walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that\r\n  darkness hath blinded his eyes.\r\n\r\n  “A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another. * *\r\n  Love is the fulfilling of the law.”\r\n\r\nJesus himself taught the disregard of the sabbath as a day of ceasing\r\nfrom labor or recreation and are we to suppose that both his teaching\r\nand practice had no meaning?\r\n\r\nPaul says, “One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth\r\nevery day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind. Let\r\nno man therefore judge you in respect of a holy day or of the new moon\r\nor of the sabbath days.”\r\n\r\nThe first legal enactment requiring an observance of Sunday as a\r\nSabbath, was foisted upon the Christian world A. D. 321, by Constantine\r\nthe Great—a heartless tyrant who had caused seven members of his family\r\nto be put to death in cold blood, that he might attain political\r\nand religious supremacy! He embraced Christianity because the Pagan\r\npriests and pontiffs could not grant him absolution, and would not\r\nfraternize with such a murderous monster! Hence he became the father\r\nof the so-called Sunday laws. Even Constantine’s decree did not\r\ninterdict recreation nor the tillage of the soil. In general, through\r\nthe Christian world, the day was a holiday, such as it now is on the\r\ncontinent of Europe. There the hours of service in the churches fall,\r\nusually, in the morning, and are strictly observed while the rest of\r\nthe day is universally given to enjoyment. Let those, however, who are\r\naccustomed to cry out at the notion of a continental Sunday, remember\r\nthat they are themselves the innovators, and let them, too, examine the\r\nfollowing passages from the writings of men whose names must command\r\nrespect, and not one of whom would speak in such a matter without\r\nmature consideration:\r\n\r\n  “It will be plainly seen that Jesus did decidedly and avowedly\r\n  VIOLATE THE SABBATH. The dogma of the assembly of divines at\r\n  Westminster, that the observance of the Sabbath is a part of the\r\n  moral law, is to me utterly unintelligible.”—Archbishop Whately.\r\n\r\n  “As for the seventh day, that has gone to its grave with the signs\r\n  and shadows of the Old Testament. Its imposition by law leads to\r\n  blood and stoning to death those who do but gather sticks thereon; a\r\n  thing which no way becomes the gospel.”—Bunyan.\r\n\r\n  “The law of the Sabbath being thus repealed, that no particular day\r\n  of worship has been appointed in its place is evident.”—Milton.\r\n\r\n  “They who think that by the authority of the Church, the observance\r\n  of the Lord’s day was appointed instead of the Sabbath, as if\r\n  necessary, are greatly deceived.—Melancthon.\r\n\r\n  * * “And truly we see what such a doctrine has profited; for those\r\n  who adopt it far exceed the Jews in a gross, carnal and superstitious\r\n  observance of the Sabbath.”—John Calvin.\r\n\r\n  “As regards the Sabbath or Sunday, there is no necessity for\r\n  keeping it; but if we do it ought not to be on account of Moses’s\r\n  commandment, but because nature teaches us from time to time to\r\n  take a day of rest. * * If anywhere the day is made holy for the\r\n  mere day’s sake, then I order you to work on it, to ride on it, to\r\n  dance on it, to do anything that will reprove this encroachment on\r\n  Christian spirit and liberty.”—Martin Luther.\r\n\r\n  “These things refute those who suppose that the first day of the\r\n  week (that is, the Lord’s day), was substituted in place of the\r\n  Sabbath, for no mention is made of such a thing by Christ or his\r\n  Apostles.”—Grotius.\r\n\r\nTyndale the martyr, Erasmus, Paley, McNight and a host of other\r\nChristian authorities, were and are of the same opinion regarding\r\nSabbath observance. England and America stand practically alone in\r\nretaining so much of the Jewish Sabbath. Here is a letter from Benjamin\r\nFranklin to Jared Ingersoll of New Haven, Conn., which bears directly\r\non the subject and may be read with both interest and profit by those\r\nwho concern themselves in Sunday laws.[22]\r\n\r\n[22] The original is in the possession of the New Haven Colony\r\nHistorical Society.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM PENN,\r\n\r\nThe Quaker Brewer, and Founder of Pennsylvania, 1644-1718. (See page\r\n26.)]\r\n\r\n                  PHILADELPHIA, December 11, 1762.\r\n\r\n  “I should be glad to know what it is that distinguishes Connecticut\r\n  Religion from common Religion:—communicate, if you please, some of\r\n  these particulars that you think will amuse me as a virtuoso. When I\r\n  traveled in Flanders I thought of your excessively strict observation\r\n  of Sunday; and that a man could hardly travel on that day among\r\n  you upon this lawful occasion, without Hazard of Punishment, while\r\n  where I was every one traveled, if he pleased, or diverted himself\r\n  in any other way; and in the afternoon both high and low went to\r\n  the Play or the Opera, where there was plenty of Singing, Fiddling\r\n  and Dancing. I looked around for God’s Judgments, but saw no signs\r\n  of them. The Cities were well built and full of Inhabitants, the\r\n  Markets filled with Plenty, the People well favored and well clothed;\r\n  the Fields well tilled; the Cattle fat and strong; the Fences,\r\n  Houses and Windows all in Repair; and no _Old Tenor_ anywhere in the\r\n  Country;—which would almost make one suspect that the Deity is not so\r\n  angry at that offense as a New England Justice.”\r\n\r\n                                                            B. FRANKLIN.\r\n\r\nA correspondent of the New York _Staats-Zeitung_[23] writes as follows:\r\n“The Emperor of Germany has made a contribution to the discussion of\r\nthe Sunday question, that is very much to the point. It is an address\r\nto the Prussian Synod, which had recently objected to the holding of\r\na review on Sunday, and reads thus: ‘He who instituted the Sabbath\r\nhas declared that the Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the\r\nSabbath. The puritanic and Calvinistic conception of the Sabbath as a\r\nday of penance and repentance, has always been foreign to the feeling\r\nand taste of the German people.’”\r\n\r\n[23] New York _Staats-Zeitung_, Nov. 1, 1879.\r\n\r\nThese words of the Emperor will receive the hearty assent of every\r\nGerman-American, and preachers and pietists may as well understand\r\nthat Germans in America will struggle as long for their free Sunday\r\nas Germans in their old home have for a free German Rhine. They have\r\nconquered back the “sacred stream” and something more into the bargain,\r\nand we here shall have no less success in securing a free, cheerful\r\nSunday, if we remain united and true to our principles.\r\n\r\nEngland formerly held the same views that then and since have prevailed\r\non the continent, but gradually the liberty of the day was restricted\r\nand its character wholly changed. We have lately met with an excellent\r\nsummary of the course of legislation that produced this result. It\r\nmarks clearly the various stages of the restrictive process and we\r\ncannot do better than reproduce it here for the benefit of readers to\r\nwhom it may prove novel.\r\n\r\n“Prior to the statute of 1676, any act done on Sunday, except in\r\nproceedings of courts, was of the same binding force as if performed on\r\nany other day. Parliament sat on that day, for in the reign of Edward\r\nI., in 1278 and 1305, three statutes were made on Sunday. Nor did the\r\nfirst restraining laws make any distinction between Sundays and other\r\nholy days. Thus the statute of 28 Edward III., Cap. 14, in 1357, says:\r\n“Shewing of wools (_i. e._, by merchants) shall be made at the staple\r\nevery day in the week except the Sunday and solemn feasts of the year.”\r\nNo further enactment was made touching the matter in question for\r\nnearly 100 years; but in 1448 was passed the act of 27 Henry VI., Cap.\r\n5, entitled, “Certain days wherein fairs and markets ought not to be\r\nkept,” which sets forth that “The King hath ordained that all manner\r\nof fairs and markets in said principal feasts (of Ascension, Corpus\r\nChristi, Assumption, and All Saints) and Sundays and Good Friday shall\r\nclearly cease from all shewing of any goods or merchandises (necessary\r\nvictuals only except);” but in recognition of the fact that there had\r\npreviously been no such restriction, it is provided that “Nevertheless,\r\nof his special grace (the King) granted to them power which of old time\r\nhad no day to hold their fair or market, but only upon the festival\r\ndays aforesaid, to hold the same authority and strength of his old\r\ngrant within three days next before said feasts or next after.”\r\n\r\nThe act of 4, Edward IV., Cap. 7, in 1464, seems to have been\r\noccasioned by some special irritation from the dishonesty of\r\nleather-dressers and shoemakers; for, after sundry stringent provisions\r\napplying to them generally, it is provided that “No person, cordwainer\r\nor cobbler, within the City of London * * * upon any Sunday in the\r\nyear, or in the feasts of the Nativity or Ascension of our Lord, or\r\nin the feast of Corpus Christi, shall sell, or command, or do to be\r\nsold, any shoes, huseaus, or galoches, or upon the Sunday, or any of\r\nsaid feasts, shall set or put upon the feet or legs of any person, any\r\nshoes, huseaus, or galoches.” This statute was repealed in 1522, but\r\nre-enacted, in part, in 1604.\r\n\r\nIn 1552 was passed “An act for keeping holy days and feasting days”\r\n(5 and 6 Edw. IV., Cap. 2), the preamble of which is an instructive\r\nexample of the pains taken by all Christians, Catholic and Protestant,\r\nprior to the seventeenth century, to deny that Sunday or any other holy\r\nor feast day, possessed of itself any sacredness or any higher claim\r\nto observance than that of convenience for the purpose of uniformity\r\nin worship. It ran thus: “For as much as at all times men be not\r\nso mindful to laud and praise God * * * as their bounden duty doth\r\nrequire; therefore, to call men to remembrance of their duty and help\r\ntheir infirmity, it hath been wholesomely provided that there shall\r\nbe some certain times and days appointed wherein the Christian should\r\ncease from all kinds of labors; * * * neither is it to be thought\r\nthat there is any certain time or definite number of days prescribed\r\nin Holy Scripture, but that the appointment, both of time and also of\r\nthe number of the days, is left by the authority of God’s word to the\r\nliberty of Christ’s Church to be determined and assigned orderly in\r\nevery country by the discretion of the rulers and ministers thereof,\r\nas they shall judge most expedient for the true setting forth of God’s\r\nglory and the edification of their people; be it therefore enacted,\r\nthat all the days hereafter mentioned (to wit: Sundays, the Feast of\r\nthe Circumcision, and twenty-two other feast days that are named, and\r\nMondays and Tuesdays in Easter Week and Whitsun Week) shall be kept\r\nand commanded to be kept holy days, and none other.” It was further\r\nprovided, “That it shall be lawful to every husbandman, laborer,\r\nfisherman, * * * upon the holy days aforesaid, in harvest, or at any\r\nother time of the year when necessity shall require, to labor, ride,\r\nfish, or work any kind of work at their free wills and pleasure.” This\r\nProtestant law was repealed the next year by the Catholic government\r\nof Mary, and restored in 1604, in the first year of James I. It is\r\nstrikingly similiar to the decree of Constantine the Great, made in\r\nthe year 321: “Let all Judges and people of the town rest, and all the\r\nvarious trades be suspended, on the venerable day of the sun. Those who\r\nlive in the country, however, may freely and without fault attend to\r\nthe cultivation of their fields * * * lest, with the loss of favorable\r\nopportunity, the commodities offered by Divine Providence should be\r\ndestroyed.”\r\n\r\nIn 1558 (1 Eliz., Cap. 2, Sec. 14,) was passed the first law requiring\r\nattendance upon public worship “upon every Sunday, and other days\r\nordained and used to be kept as holy days,” upon pain of church censure\r\nand a fine of twelvepence.\r\n\r\nThe English Puritans of the time of James I., were the first to impose\r\nthe name and character of the Jewish Sabbath upon the first day of the\r\nweek, and those who came to America brought the name and the idea with\r\nthem. To that seventeenth-century influence, and not to any scriptural\r\nor ecclesiastical teaching of any earlier time, are we indebted for\r\nsermons on Sunday observance. The doctrine held on that subject by most\r\nevangelical Christians is not yet three hundred years old.\r\n\r\nIn 1625 was passed a law (1 Car. I., Cap. 1,) that “There should be no\r\nmeeting, assemblies, or concourse of people out of their own parishes\r\non the Lord’s day, for any sports or pastimes whatsoever; nor any\r\nbear-baiting, bull-baiting, interludes, common plays, or other unlawful\r\nexercises or pastimes used by any persons within their own parishes.”\r\n“_This statute_,” says Blackstone, “_does not prohibit, but rather\r\nimpliedly allows any innocent recreation or amusement within their\r\nrespective parishes, even on the Lord’s day, after Divine service is\r\nover;_” _and, in point of fact, both Charles I. and his father before\r\nhim issued proclamations encouraging such amusements after Divine\r\nservice._\r\n\r\nIn 1676 was enacted the well known “Lord’s Day act,” of 29 Car. II.,\r\nCap. 7, which prohibits generally all work, labor, and business on\r\nSunday, except works of necessity and charity, and which, with more or\r\nless modification, forms the basis of all Sunday laws now extant in the\r\nUnited States. Exceptions to this law in favor of hackney coachmen,\r\nfishwomen, and chairmen, were enacted in 1694, 1699, and 1710, and a\r\nclause prohibiting bird hunting was subsequently added, but it remained\r\nin substance until alterations and repeals of English laws ceased to\r\nhave any force in this country.”\r\n\r\nAs an historical matter the question is not very abstruse and the truth\r\nis well enough known to scholars everywhere; should there not then be\r\ncharity for honest convictions?\r\n\r\nIn many cases the practice for years has been tolerably liberal while\r\nall the time the old and stringent puritanical Sunday laws of 1702 were\r\nretained on the statute books liable to be enforced whenever a minority\r\nshould choose to demand their revival.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Belmont Avenue Brewery,\r\n\r\nNEWARK, N. J.,\r\n\r\nGOTTFRIED KRUEGER, PROPRIETOR.\r\n\r\n_For historical sketch, see Appendix C, page 183._]\r\n\r\nSuch cases have recently been seen in many places in this and other\r\nstates, but particularly so in Newark, N. J., where the enforcement\r\nof such an old act forbidding the sale of beer and other beverages\r\non Sunday caused a reaction of unexpected violence, and very\r\ncharacteristic of the profound change that has already taken place in\r\nthe popular conception of the day. The circumstances in brief were as\r\nfollows: A considerable number of prohibitionists had organized under\r\nthe name of the Law and Order Association for the purpose of enforcing\r\nthe Sunday law and preventing the licensing of bar rooms. Numerous\r\nprosecutions were made and carried through to conviction under the old\r\nstate law after having failed in the city police courts. Thereupon the\r\nCitizens’ Protective Association was formed and in September, 1879,\r\na demonstration was made by a great procession, and the adoption of\r\nresolutions calling for a repeal of the law which, after lying idle so\r\nlong, had suddenly been revived to the great injury of an established\r\nbusiness, and with manifest injustice to a large number of peaceable\r\ncitizens who conceived their rights to be interfered with, inasmuch as\r\na law long inoperative must practically be regarded as a dead letter\r\nand ignored by those who, if they had supposed it to possess vital\r\npower, would have removed from its jurisdiction or taken pains never\r\nto come within it. The procession numbered ten or twelve thousand and\r\ngreat enthusiasm was displayed, not only in the ranks, but by residents\r\nall along the line of march. The matter was evidently one which took a\r\ndeep hold on the feelings of the community and none the less because of\r\na common feeling that they had been unfairly treated by the appeal to a\r\nlaw not in harmony with the spirit of the times or of abstract justice.\r\nA crowd is very apt to be wrong and it is easy to stir up the people,\r\nbut here the crowd had more reason on its side than it was itself\r\naware of, reason founded on history, and making the law that had been\r\nenforced an unwarrantable attack on personal liberty. They felt that\r\nit was so, though few probably would have been able to give a clear\r\nexplanation of the feeling or trace its justification by the facts.\r\nAs for enthusiasm, we are told that it needed no stimulus and can\r\neasily believe it to have been so, for aside from the more abstract and\r\nphilosophical justice of their complaint, there was the immediate smart\r\nfelt by men who lose the day of recreation to which they have looked\r\nforward all the week, or find that they are to suffer a pecuniary loss\r\nand that their occupation is not only checked but stigmatized. The\r\nmatter made a great excitement and called out many bitter paragraphs on\r\nboth sides, but chiefly among the more narrow-minded and pharisaical\r\nof so-called religious press. We have no space or disposition to go\r\ninto the details of their criticism, even for the sake of illustrating\r\nhow far misrepresentation and innuendo may be made to stand in place\r\nof careful statement and sound argument. The case has been spoken of\r\nbecause it is in some sense typical, because it represents the course\r\nof public thought and feeling, and the change which even within two or\r\nthree generations has come over the rigid enactments of puritan early\r\nsettlers. These puritans did much good but it was all tempered and\r\nshadowed by an austere severity that has no merit in itself and that\r\ncrushes out much the better part of life and obscures many a truth that\r\nin itself is clear as noonday. The mind of the people has changed. It\r\nis time that the law should be changed also. The _Christian Union_ has\r\nsaid, “The sooner the issue is made in Chicago between a whole sabbath\r\nand none at all, the sooner the Christian element in the community\r\nwill win the victory it will deserve. Half a sabbath is hardly worth\r\nfighting for.” We say that the best rule for observing the day is that\r\nwhich gives the greatest amount of harmless freedom and enjoyment to\r\nthe greatest number, each according to his own judgment and conscience.\r\nOur foreign element is very large and has its own beliefs and\r\ntraditions, as dear and as implicitly held as those of any one whose\r\ntraining and practice have been after the strictest sabbatarian pattern.\r\n\r\nWe have attempted here no argument, but simply given some cardinal\r\nfacts, and now leave the matter in the hope that those who dissent will\r\nat least respect honest utterance and not allow their objections on\r\nthis one point to prejudice them against our discussion of the value of\r\nmalt beverages as aids to genuine temperance and useful friends to man.\r\n\r\nWe close as we began, with the words which seem to us to indicate the\r\nonly practical road to real temperance, and record again our motto\r\n\r\n                          BEER AGAINST WHISKY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             APPENDIX A.\r\n\r\n        TOTAL PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION OF BEER IN VARIOUS\r\n                        COUNTRIES AND CITIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tables here given have been prepared with great care after a\r\nthorough examination and comparison of authorities. The discrepancies\r\nand errors discovered in various published statements of a similar\r\nnature have made the task a difficult one, but it is believed that the\r\npresent results will be found substantially accurate. Table A gives\r\na list of the chief beer producing countries, with the population of\r\neach, its annual product in hectoliters and gallons, the number of its\r\nbreweries and the production per head of population. The countries\r\nare arranged in the order of product _per capita_. Table B gives the\r\nsame countries arranged in the order of total production, and for\r\nconvenience of reference repeats the product _per capita_.\r\n\r\n                                       TABLE A.\r\n                  | Population.\r\n                  |         | Production In Hectoliters.

Most\r\nof this is consumed at home, and great quantities are imported from\r\nChristiana, Norway, and Copenhagen, Denmark, while ale and porter are\r\nlargely brought from England.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of notice that Bavaria, which has been known for centuries\r\nas the cradle of men of arts and sciences, stands at the head of the\r\nlist of beer producing countries. With a population of only about\r\nfive millions, it brews three hundred and twenty-nine million gallons\r\nor 65.5 gallons to every individual; and next in rank is the little\r\nkingdom of Wurtemberg, the native state of the great Schiller. Munich,\r\nthe capital of Bavaria is especially celebrated for the long array of\r\nmen of arts, letters and science who have either been born there or\r\nadopted it as a residence. But it is, at the same time, the greatest\r\nbeer-drinking city in the world. It produced in the year 1876 no less\r\nthan 1,198,951 hectoliters = 31,772,201 gallons, and its actual home\r\nconsumption in that year was 956,455 hectoliters = 25,346,057 gallons,\r\nwhich, in a population of 198,000, gives 128 gallons a year for every\r\nindividual, costing in all $6,216,955, or about $31 per head. The\r\namount paid for beer is less by $1,363,800 than the amount paid for\r\nhouse rent. In the years 1877 and 1878 the amount paid for beer fell\r\noff, but for the current year (1879) it will, according to statistics\r\nthus far received, be larger than ever before. The taxes for the\r\nmunicipal government and city taxes are less than a tenth of the amount\r\nexpended for beer—and yet there is not a more orderly and well behaved\r\ncity in the world than this same Munich. All this is indirect evidence\r\nof great importance as to the social and intellectual effect that may\r\nbe expected to follow a free and even a very large use of beer.\r\n\r\nVienna stands in a similar category though it offers a less striking\r\nillustration of the case than Munich does. It has, however, one brewer\r\nwhose operations are extensive enough to deserve special mention. This\r\nis the well-known Anton Dreher, whose business, begun at Schwechat\r\nin 1836, now comprises large establishments in four Austrian cities,\r\nwith an annual product of 500,000 barrels, paying a government tax of\r\n$750,000.00 or more. The business employs combined water and steam\r\nengines of 100 horse power, 400 brewers, 200 teamsters and common\r\nlaborers, 150 horses, and no less than 250 draught oxen.\r\n\r\nKarlsruhe, the capital of Baden is also an important brewing city. Its\r\nproduct is 4,884,350 gallons, and of this amount something over one\r\nmillion gallons is contributed by the Albert Printz brewery alone.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, useless to attempt any mention of the cities or\r\ndistricts that are distinguished for the quantity or quality of their\r\nbeer. We can only say that they are very numerous, and add that their\r\ncharacter is such as to corroborate all that has been said in this book\r\ntouching the beneficial effects of a free use of beer in the community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             APPENDIX B.\r\n\r\n                         ANALYSES OF BEERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following analyses will be found of interest to every student of\r\nthe beer question.[26] The first is from Professor Mulder’s work on\r\nbeer.\r\n\r\n[26] Additional analyses may be found in the body of the book, pages\r\n97, 98 and 99.\r\n\r\n  I.—BAVARIAN BEERS.

Not merely its extent but all its\r\nappliances are characteristic of this busy, progressive age, that knows\r\nhow to plant money in extensive outfits and supervision, in order that\r\nit may yield a greater return, just as seeds put in rich earth and\r\ncarefully tended during growth give larger harvests of better quality\r\nthan were ever looked for in the old hap-hazard, starving plan. We\r\ncannot mention one in fifty of those who deserve notice. Think, for\r\ninstance, of the great brewery of M. T. Bass, at Burton on Trent,\r\nwhich produces about one million barrels a year; or those of Anton\r\nDreher, turning out five hundred thousand barrels, and see if it is\r\npossible to attain such results except by modern processes and modern\r\nbusiness energy. No house in the United States has yet reached so\r\ngreat a product, but more than one is on the direct way, and it is\r\nnot only possible but probable that within fifty years the largest\r\nestablishments and the finest beer will be found in this country. In\r\nthe multitude of those who fairly deserve mention it seems almost\r\ninvidious to select a few, but it has seemed best to give a brief\r\naccount of some that, in one way or another, may be regarded as typical\r\nexponents of this department of American industry. Those mentioned are\r\nnot always the largest or best known, but they represent different\r\nparts of the country and together form a tolerable epitome of the\r\nwhole brewing business, with its larger and smaller breweries, old and\r\nnew establishments, and various ways of procedure, the common feature\r\nbeing that all endeavor to produce a thoroughly good article, and trust\r\nto the merit of the product for success rather than to any temporary\r\nadvantages that may be gained by cheapening their brew at the expense\r\nof its flavor or wholesomeness. This is the noticeable fact in the\r\nbrewing trade at the present time.\r\n\r\n\r\n      HISTORICAL SKETCH OF HON. FREDERICK LAUER OF READING, PA.\r\n\r\nThe brewery of Mr. Frederick Lauer of Reading, Pa., is not only among\r\nthe oldest in the country, but has remained from the beginning in the\r\nhands of the Lauer family. It was established in 1823 at Womelsdorf, a\r\nfew miles from Reading, by the father of the present proprietor, who\r\nhad just arrived from Germany. In 1826 it was removed to Reading, and\r\nthe business started on the same spot where it is now carried on. The\r\nelder Lauer was an indefatigable worker, and is said at this time to\r\nhave taken no more than two or three hours regular sleep a day. In 1835\r\nhis son Frederick succeeded to the sole proprietorship of the brewery,\r\nand its progress from this time was very rapid. For several years ale\r\nand porter had been brewed, but no lager beer was made in the country\r\nuntil 1842. In the year 1844 Mr. Lauer began to brew lager beer, and\r\nwas thus one of the pioneers in this industry; and since that time ale,\r\nlager beer and porter have been produced constantly. The brewery is a\r\nmodel of neatness and convenience, perfect in every appointment and\r\nthe special pride and pet of its owner, who would much rather lose a\r\nyear’s profits than tolerate dirt or disorder or the production of a\r\npoor beer. Mr. Lauer has not, however, been constantly occupied with\r\nhis private business. For at least thirty years he has been one of\r\nthe prominent men of the city of Reading; has held various important\r\npublic positions, political and otherwise, and has done great service\r\nin securing equable legislation in matters affecting the brewing\r\ntrade. A man of quick perception and untiring energy, he has again and\r\nagain accomplished alone, or nearly alone, things that were considered\r\nalmost impossible, and from whose attempt his associates recoiled. An\r\ninstance in point is thus described in a recently published sketch of\r\nhis life: “The way the tax was saved was as follows: Shortly before the\r\nadjournment of Congress, he (Mr. Lauer) received a letter apprising him\r\nthat the Committee on Ways and Means were about advising an increase.\r\nHe immediately telegraphed to the nearest members of the Brewers’\r\nCommittee to join him at Washington. They had an interview with the\r\nCommittee of Ways and Means, but the Committee refused to make any\r\nmodification in the bill, as it had already passed the first reading in\r\nthe House. There were ten members of the Brewers’ Committee, nine of\r\nwhom, after the interview, agreed to allow the fifty cents increase and\r\nmake no further exertion in the matter. Mr. Lauer, the tenth, was not\r\nsatisfied; and, after gaining the consent of the Committee, he called\r\non a number of members of the House, and urged upon them the ruinous\r\nconsequences to the brewing business which would follow the passage of\r\nthe bill as reported. The same day, February 11, 1865, the bill came up\r\nin Committee of the Whole, when the desired modification was made by a\r\nvote of seventy-three to sixty-eight, and the following week the bill\r\ncame up for final passage, when the bill, as modified, was passed by a\r\nmajority of four. The members from Kentucky who had voted against the\r\nmodification in the first place, voted for the bill when it came up on\r\nthe third reading, they having been influenced through the exertions of\r\nMr. Lauer. Immediately after its passage, Thad. Stevens, chairman on\r\nthe Ways and Means, jumped up and exclaimed, ‘That d—d Lauer did it.’”\r\n\r\nThis is only one of many instances in which Mr. Lauer’s efforts have\r\nbeen of the greatest value to brewers at large and incidentally to the\r\nwhole country. He was the first president of the United States Brewers’\r\nAssociation, and has more than once been able in time of scarcity to\r\nsecure such shipments of malt or hops from foreign countries as to\r\nrelieve the distress and materially reduce the inflated price of these\r\narticles.\r\n\r\n\r\n           THE JOSEPH SCHLITZ BREWING CO., MILWAUKEE, WIS.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1849 Mr. August Krug built a small brewery at Milwaukee on\r\nChestnut street, between 4th and 5th streets, and the year after he\r\nadded vaults of a capacity of 150 barrels, situated on the corner of\r\n3d and Walnut streets. His sale was about 250 barrels. From this small\r\nbeginning there developed one of the largest breweries in the country.\r\n\r\nMr. Krug died in 1856, and Mr. Joseph Schlitz who had come to Milwaukee\r\nduring the previous year took the management of the business which\r\nat first increased only moderately although managed with skill and\r\nenergy. In the year 1865 the sales were 4,400 barrels. Five years\r\nlater he began the erection of the present brewery on the corner of 3d\r\nand Walnut streets, the same place where the original vaults had been\r\nsituated. The greater part of the present buildings were completed\r\nwithin two years, and the sales for 1871 amounted to 12,283 barrels.\r\nThe period of rapid development had now been reached, and the advance\r\nup to the present time has been remarkable as may be seen from the\r\nfollowing table of the yearly sales, beginning with the year 1870.\r\n\r\n               1870, Barrels,                    8,707\r\n               1871,  “                         12,283\r\n               1872,  “                         30,868\r\n               1873,  “                         49,623\r\n               1874,  “                         69,624\r\n               1875,  “                         74,813\r\n               1876,  “                         71,017\r\n               1877,  “                         79,538\r\n               1878,  “                         82,068\r\n               1879,  “ ending April,          110,832\r\n\r\nIn 1874 the business was made into a stock company under the title\r\n“Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company,” with Mr. Schlitz as president, the\r\nsecretary and superintendent being respectively, Mr. August Uihlein and\r\nMr. Henry Uihlein. Being thus partially relieved of the immediate cares\r\nof business Mr. Schlitz in the following year sailed for Germany to\r\nvisit his native home of Mayence. The vessel was the Schiller, which,\r\nas all readers must remember, was wrecked on the Scilly Islands, May 7,\r\n1875, and Mr. Schlitz was one of the many victims of that disaster. In\r\nthese circumstances the company organization was probably a fortunate\r\ncircumstance for the business. The death of a sole proprietor or even\r\na sole nominal proprietor is apt to derange a business, no matter how\r\ncapable the successor may be, and this difficulty is almost avoided\r\nin the case of an established company. The present management is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nPresident, Henry Uihlein; secretary, August Uihlein; superintendent,\r\nAlfred Uihlein. The brewery in its present form occupies two whole\r\nsquares, and still larger accommodations may be needed at no distant\r\nday. There is a new ice-house 100 × 124 feet, four stories high, and\r\nwith a twenty-four foot basement. The cellars have a capacity of 25,000\r\nbarrels; the whole storage capacity is 70,000 barrels, and the brewery\r\nis already fitted for the production of 200,000 barrels a year. There\r\nis a large coopering establishment and the gathering of ice alone\r\noccupies 300 men and 90 teams for about twenty days every year. The\r\nbeer is sent all over the United States and to Brazil, Central America\r\nand Mexico, in both barrels and bottles. About one million bottles were\r\nsold in 1877, and in the succeeding year the amount was more than two\r\nmillions. The bottling department alone occupies a building 46 × 150\r\nfeet, with basement, and fitted with all conveniences for the work.\r\n\r\nThe analysis of this beer gives the following result for the percentage\r\nof alcohol: ordinary lager beer 4.5 volumetrically, and 5.6 by weight.\r\nThe bottled lager beer shows as a result of four analyses within six\r\nmonths, six per cent. of alcohol volumetrically, and 4.8 by weight.\r\nThis is certainly an excellent showing, and calculated to enhance the\r\nreputation of any brewery.\r\n\r\n\r\n         THE BREWERY OF MR. GOTTFRIED KRUEGER, NEWARK, N. J.\r\n\r\nThe brewery now owned by Mr. Gottfried Krueger was founded in 1851 by\r\nLouis Adam and J. Braun, the latter of whom died before the buildings\r\nwere completed. Mr. Adam at once formed a partnership with John Laible\r\nunder the firm name of Laible & Adam, and pushed the work so well that\r\nwithin the year brewing was commenced, and a sale of 1,200 barrels for\r\nthe first twelve months secured.\r\n\r\nThe property then consisted of six city lots, a small frame house\r\npartly used as a saloon, a one-story frame brewery thirty feet square,\r\na stable for two horses and vaults for 500 barrels of beer. The brewing\r\ncapacity was about twenty barrels.\r\n\r\nIn 1852 Mr. Gottfried Krueger, the present proprietor, came to this\r\ncountry, and being a relative of Mr. Laible entered the brewery as an\r\napprentice. Here he remained until Messrs. Laible and Adam dissolved\r\npartnership in 1855, Mr. Laible building a new brewery and Mr. Adam\r\ncontinuing the old business. Mr. Krueger accompanied Mr. Laible and\r\nbecame foreman in the establishment where he remained until 1865\r\nwhen in conjunction with Mr. Gottlieb Hill he bought the old brewery\r\nof Louis Adam and commenced business under the firm name of Hill &\r\nKrueger. During the interval a new brewery had been added and a new\r\nstable for six horses, while the sale had increased to 4,000 barrels\r\nand the brewing capacity to fifty barrels. This advance, however, was\r\ndestined to be greatly surpassed by that made under the new management.\r\nThe first step was the building of two new vaults of a capacity of\r\n5,000 barrels. This together with numerous minor improvements was\r\naccomplished during the first year, and within the same time the sale\r\nof beer was doubled. The years next succeeding saw a rapid development.\r\nIn 1866 the firm built a new three-story brick malt and store-house; in\r\n1876 a large building for fermenting rooms; in 1868 stables for twenty\r\nhorses; in 1869 an ice-house of 4,000 barrels capacity, and also vaults\r\nfor 2,000 barrels. The result fully justified these preparations for an\r\nenlarged business for the sale increased steadily year by year and in\r\n1875 amounted to 25,000 barrels.\r\n\r\nAt this time Mr. Hill was compelled by the state of his health to\r\nretire from business, and on the 16th of February, 1875, Mr. Krueger\r\nbecame the sole owner of the property which then covered the entire\r\nblock. Adding in 1878 a model office building and in 1879 new stables\r\nfor forty-five horses, he has now one of the finest breweries in the\r\nState. The sale for the current year will be over 40,000 barrels.\r\n\r\nIn explanation of the cut we may add that the malt and brew-houses\r\nare situated on Belmont avenue, the office and stables on West Kinney\r\nstreet, the ice-house on Charlton street, and the yards etc., on\r\nMontgomery street.\r\n\r\nEvery one connected with the establishment, from Mr. Krueger down,\r\nis thoroughly fit for his duties and zealous in their discharge. The\r\nmanagement is by the proprietor himself, ably seconded by Mr. Theodore\r\nC. W. Eggerking who has been long and successfully connected with the\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             APPENDIX D.\r\n\r\n LIST OF BREWERS WITH PRODUCT FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS, 1878 AND 1879.\r\n                      ALSO, PRODUCT BY STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is some difference of opinion as to the propriety of publishing\r\nsuch information as the annual product of the various breweries in\r\nthe country, and it therefore seems proper to explain why it has been\r\ndecided to give the figures in these pages, and how the information has\r\nbeen obtained.\r\n\r\nFor some time the particulars were furnished to certain parties in\r\nChicago and New York, by a clerk in the Internal Revenue Department\r\nat Washington. In this there was probably an injustice, for what is\r\ndemanded by the law cannot be withheld by the brewer, and both analogy\r\nand general reasoning indicate that this forced information should\r\nbe considered as confidential, and not exposed to the comment of\r\nindifferent persons or business rivals.\r\n\r\nThis view of the case is the one now held by the Department, as appears\r\nfrom the following correspondence:\r\n\r\n  _Official._\r\n\r\n  FROM THE COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE.\r\n\r\n  (Copy.)\r\n\r\n  TREASURY DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C.,\r\n\r\n  September 15, 1879.\r\n\r\n  HENRY H. RUETER, ESQ.,\r\n\r\n  _President United States Brewers’ Association_.\r\n\r\n  SIR: Your attention is called to an article in the _Brewers’ Gazette_\r\n  of August 15, ultimo, headed, “Thrown Together; A Comparative View\r\n  of the so-called Brewers’ Returns,” in which are embraced copies of\r\n  letters from this office in relation to lists of reports of sales of\r\n  fermented liquors for the years 1878 and 1879, as published by the\r\n  _Western Brewer_ and A. E. Tovey.\r\n\r\n  Please inform me whether the brewers of the United States desire\r\n  that such tabulated statements be prepared by this Bureau as therein\r\n  stated for publication.\r\n\r\n                                                      Very respectfully,\r\n\r\n                                                 (Signed) GREEN B. RAUM,\r\n\r\n                                                         _Commissioner_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  REPLY OF THE PRESIDENT OF BREWERS’ ASSOCIATION.\r\n\r\n  (Copy.)\r\n\r\n  UNITED STATES BREWERS’ ASSOCIATION,\r\n\r\n        BOSTON, September 25, 1879.\r\n\r\n  GEN. GREEN B. RAUM,\r\n\r\n  _Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Washington, D. C._\r\n\r\n  SIR: In reply to your esteemed letter of the 15th inst., referring to\r\n  the preparation and publication of tabulated statements of brewers’\r\n  sales, and asking if, in my opinion, the brewers of the United States\r\n  desire that such tabulated statements be prepared by the Internal\r\n  Revenue Bureau—I beg to state, that I have no data which would enable\r\n  me to answer your question definitely. Many brewers, undoubtedly,\r\n  feel indifferent in the matter; some may favor the publication, and\r\n  others are opposed to it. They argue that there is no parallel case\r\n  in any other branch of trade; that individual business affairs should\r\n  not be thus made public; that the publication of individual sales\r\n  leads to undue competition; and that these lists are a bone of bitter\r\n  contention between the publishers.\r\n\r\n  If the inquiry has been addressed to me with reference to the future\r\n  action of the Department, I beg leave to suggest that the brewers’\r\n  wishes can be best ascertained at their next yearly meeting, in June,\r\n  and I would respectfully ask you to delay action in the matter till\r\n  then.\r\n\r\n                                     I am, sir, most respectfully yours,\r\n\r\n                                                        HENRY H. RUETER.\r\n\r\n\r\nANSWER TO ABOVE FROM INTERNAL REVENUE DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\n  TREASURY DEPARTMENT,\r\n\r\n  OFFICE OF INTERNAL REVENUE,\r\n\r\n        WASHINGTON, September 29, 1879.\r\n\r\n  HENRY H. RUETER, ESQ.\r\n\r\n  _President United States Brewers’ Association, Boston, Mass._\r\n\r\n  SIR: Acknowledging the receipt of yours of the 25th instant, in\r\n  reply to office letter of the 15th instant calling attention to an\r\n  article published in the _Brewers’ Gazette_ relative to errors in\r\n  reports of sales of fermented liquors for the years 1878 and 1879,\r\n  as published by the _Western Brewer_ and A. E. Tovey, and inquiring\r\n  if such publications were considered desirable by the brewers of the\r\n  United States, I have to say that I fully concur in your opinion\r\n  that, while some may favor the publication of such statistics, others\r\n  would object thereto, and would argue that there is no parallel case\r\n  in any other branch of trade; and that individual business affairs\r\n  should not thus be made public; that such publications lead to\r\n  undue competition; and that they become a bone of bitter contention\r\n  between publishers. For this reason, I have decided to prohibit the\r\n  furnishing of such lists hereafter to any and all parties.\r\n\r\n                                                           Respectfully,\r\n\r\n                                                           R. E. ROGERS.\r\n\r\n                                                  _Acting Commissioner._\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, while it is certain that many brewers are glad to\r\nhave their product extensively stated, it is at least probable that\r\nvery few have any real objection. In order to test the question we sent\r\na printed form of inquiry, as to production, to all the brewers in\r\nthe country. A large majority furnished the desired information, and\r\nas many others doubtless failed to answer simply through negligence\r\nor indifference, it seemed certain that the number of objectors\r\nwas so small that this list might be published with propriety and\r\nto the satisfaction of far the larger part of those interested. It\r\nis to be noticed that this is a very different thing from printing\r\nenforced statements, without a shadow of authority from the brewers\r\nthemselves. In this book the figures are generally furnished by the\r\nbrewers and for this very purpose. Where no reply has been received,\r\nthe product has been stated according to the best testimony that could\r\nbe obtained, and the total result is certainly more accurate than\r\nany yet published. This is not because the government returns were\r\nincorrect, but because of carelessness in transcription, or errors\r\nof the types, or both. Whatever the cause, so many errors have been\r\ndiscovered in the so-called official lists of those who obtained their\r\ninformation through Washington, as to greatly impair the value of\r\nthose tables, and create much dissatisfaction among those who find\r\nan erroneous impression of their business thus disseminated through\r\nthe country. Without claiming that our own are absolutely free from\r\nerror, we are prepared to maintain their substantial correctness and\r\ntheir superiority to any yet offered to the public. The product here\r\nshown is greater than that stated earlier in this book. The returns\r\non which that statement was made seem to have been incomplete at the\r\ntime of publication, unless the fault lies in the transfer of figures\r\nor in the footings, a kind of defect from which few public documents\r\nof a statistical character are wholly free. The number of breweries\r\nhere given is less than the former statement, owing to the omission\r\nof a considerable number of the smaller establishments, concerning\r\nwhich no satisfactory information could be obtained, and the further\r\nomission of those whose owners were known to object to a publication\r\nof their business. The total product of all so left out is known to be\r\ninconsiderable, though it cannot be exactly ascertained.\r\n\r\nThose most apt to find fault with a public statement of the amount of\r\ntheir business are the smaller brewers, who sometimes fear that their\r\nbusiness will suffer if it is known that they dispose of less beer\r\nthan some rival. To such it may be said that a good business need not\r\nbe a large one. There are plenty of men in the country who work on a\r\ncomparatively small scale, and yet would not be induced to extend their\r\noperations. They make enough, as it is, to satisfy their wants, and\r\nthey are not loaded down by the cares that attend a struggle to sell\r\nas much as possible. They fear no injury because their sale is not so\r\nlarge as that of some one else, and they are perfectly in the right, as\r\nexperience shows. Still again, there are many small breweries to-day,\r\nthat will be great fifteen or twenty years from now. We have shown in\r\nAppendix C something of the possibilities of sudden development in this\r\nbusiness, and with the increasing taste for beer these opportunities\r\nwill be better than ever. It is not against a brewery that it is small.\r\nIts product may be of the first quality, and it may be small simply\r\nbecause the owner does not care to have it large.\r\n\r\nOther considerations might be adduced, but it seems as if enough had\r\nbeen said to justify the printing of statistics prepared as are those\r\nhere furnished, especially as they must be interesting to every one\r\nwho makes a study of the beer question and wants as much and as varied\r\ninformation as he can obtain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               SUMMARY\r\n\r\nOF THE BEER PRODUCT OF THE UNITED
