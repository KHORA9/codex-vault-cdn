This has been done, in some\r\ndegree, for the conveniency of binding this first part of the\r\nCRITICISMS ON THE ROLLIAD with the second; but more, indeed, in\r\nconsequence of a design, which we at present entertain, of printing\r\nmost of those pieces with other productions of the same Authors in\r\none octavo volume, under the title of POLITICAL MISCELLANIES.\r\n\r\n                    *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nAs the bulk and matter of the book are thus diminished, the price also\r\nis proportionally reduced. Where the CRITICISMS seem to require any\r\nelucidation from the contents of the former Appendix, extracts are\r\nnow given at the bottom of the page instead of the references in our\r\nformer Editions.\r\n\r\n                    *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThis slight change we flatter ourselves will not be disapproved by\r\nthe Public; and we hope, that they will not receive with a less degree\r\nof favour the intimation here given of the Miscellaneous Volume, which\r\nwill probably be published in the course of the ensuing winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe CRITICISMS ON THE ROLLIAD, in their original form, excited such\r\na general curiosity, that three spurious editions have already been\r\nsold, independently of their publication in various of the Daily\r\nPapers, and Monthly Magazines. Such a marked testimony in their\r\nfavour, cannot but be peculiarly flattering to us. We therefore\r\nthought it incumbent on us in return, to exert our utmost endeavours\r\nin rendering them, as far as our judgment will direct us, yet more\r\nworthy of that attention with which they have been honoured, imperfect\r\nas they fell from us, through a channel, that did not seem necessarily\r\nto demand any very great degree of precision.\r\n\r\nIn the present edition some few passages have been expunged; others\r\nsoftened; many enlarged; more corrected; and two whole numbers, with\r\nthe greater part of a third, are altogether new. A poeticoprosaical\r\nDedication to SIR LLOYD KENYON, now Lord Chief Justice of the\r\nCourt of King's Bench, has also been added; and an Appendix is now\r\ngiven, consisting of Miscellaneous Pieces, to which the Criticisms\r\nincidentally refer.\r\n\r\n                    *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nIt may perhaps give offence to some very chastized judgments, that in\r\nthis our authentic edition, we have subjoined notes on a professed\r\ncommentary. Some short explanations, however, appeared occasionally\r\nnecessary, more especially as the subjects of Political Wit in their\r\nvery nature are fugitive and evanescent. We only fear that our\r\nillustrations have not been sufficiently frequent, as we have\r\nprivately been asked to what \"Mr. Hardinge's Arithmetic\" in the\r\nDedication alluded; so little impression was made on the public by\r\nthe learned Gentleman's elaborate calculation of the Orations spoken,\r\nand the time expended in the discussion of the Westminster Scrutiny!\r\nIndeed, we have known persons even ignorant that Sir Lloyd Kenyon\r\nvoted for his stables.\r\n\r\nThis Edition has further been ornamented with a Tree of the Genealogy,\r\nand the Arms, Motto, and Crest of the ROLLOS, now ROLLES; for an\r\nexplanation of which we beg leave to refer the reader to page xiii.\r\nThe Genealogy is likewise given at full length from the Morning\r\nHerald, where it was originally published, and was probably the\r\nfoundation of the ROLLIAD. It is therefore inserted in its proper\r\nplace, before the first extract from the Dedication to the Poem, which\r\nimmediately preceded the first Numbers of the CRITICISMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPLANATION OF THE FRONTISPIECE AND TITLE-PAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe FRONTISPIECE represents Duke ROLLO, with his Sword and Ducal\r\nCoronet lying by his side. It is supposed to be a striking likeness,\r\nand was copied from a painting in the Window of a Church at Rouen\r\nin Normandy. From this illustrious Warrior springs a Tree of the\r\nGenealogy of the ROLLOS, now ROLLES. The most eminent of this great\r\nFamily alone are noticed. The particulars of their history may be\r\nfound in page xxix and xxx.\r\n[Transcriber's note: Refers to\r\n    'Short Account of the Family of the Rollos']\r\n\r\n                    *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe TITLE-PAGE exhibits the Arms, Motto, and Crest of the Family.\r\nThe Arms are, Three French Rolls, Or, between two Rolls of Parchment,\r\nProper, placed in form of a Cheveron on a Field Argent--The Motto is\r\n_Jouez bien votre Róle_, or, as we have sometimes seen it\r\nspelt--_Rolle_. The Crest, which has been lately changed by the present\r\nMr. ROLLE, is a half-length of the Master of the Rolls, like a Lion\r\ndemi-rampant with a Roll of Parchment instead of a Pheon's Head\r\nbetween his Paws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEDICATION.\r\nTo Sir Lloyd Kenyan, Bart.\r\nMASTER OF THE ROLLS, &c. &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAY IT PLEASE YOUR HONOUR,\r\n\r\nIt was originally my intention to have dedicated the CRITICISMS on\r\nthe ROLLIAD, as the ROLLIAD itself is dedicated, to the illustrious\r\ncharacter, from whose hereditary name the Poem derives its title;\r\nand[1], as I some time since apprized the public, I had actually\r\nobtained his permission to lay this little work at his feet. No\r\nsooner, however, was he made acquainted with my after-thought of\r\ninscribing my book to your honour, but, with the liberality, which\r\never marks a great mind, he wrote to me of his own accord, declaring\r\nhis compleat acquiescence in the propriety of the alteration. For if\r\nI may take the liberty of transcribing his own ingenuous and modest\r\nexpression, \"I am myself,\" said he, \"but _a simple Rolle_; SIR LLOYD\r\nKENYON _is a Master of Rolls_.\"\r\n\r\n  Great ROLLO's heir, whose cough, whose laugh, whose groan,\r\n  The' Antæus EDMUND has so oft o'erthrown:\r\n  Whose cry of \"question\" silenc'd CHARLES's sense;\r\n  That cry, more powerful than PITT's eloquence;\r\n  Ev'n he, thus high in glory, as in birth,\r\n  Yields willing way to thy superior worth.\r\n\r\nIndeed, if I had not been so happy as to receive this express sanction\r\nof Mr. ROLLE's concurrence, I should nevertheless have thought myself\r\njustified in presuming it, from the very distinguished testimony which\r\nhe has lately borne to your merits, by taking a demi-rampant of YOUR\r\nHONOUR for his crest; a circumstance, in my opinion, so highly\r\ncomplimentary to your honour, that I was studious to have it as\r\nextensively known as possible. I have therefore given directions to\r\nmy Publisher, to exhibit your portrait, with the ROLLE ARMS, and\r\nMotto, by way of Vignette in the Title Page; that displayed, as I\r\ntrust it will be, at the Window of every Bookseller in Great-Britain,\r\nit may thus attract the admiration of the most incurious, as they pass\r\nalong the streets. This solicitude, to diffuse the knowledge of your\r\nperson, as widely as your fame, may possibly occasion some little\r\ndistress to your modesty; yet permit me to hope, SIR LLOYD, that the\r\nmotive will plead my pardon; and, perhaps, even win the approbation of\r\nyour smile; if you can be supposed to smile without offence to the\r\ngravity of that nature, which seems from your very birth to have\r\nmarked you for a Judge.\r\n\r\n  Behold the' Engraver's mimic labours trace\r\n  The sober image of that sapient face:\r\n  See him, in each peculiar charm exact,\r\n  Below dilate it, and above contract;\r\n  For Nature thus, inverting her design,\r\n  From vulgar ovals hath distinguish'd thine:\r\n  See him each nicer character supply,\r\n  The pert no-meaning puckering round the eye,\r\n  The mouth in plaits precise demurely clos'd,\r\n  Each order'd feature, and each line compos'd,\r\n  Where Wisdom sits a-squat, in starch disguise,\r\n  Like Dulness couch'd, to catch us by surprise.\r\n  And now he spreads around thy pomp of wig,\r\n  In owl-like pride of legal honour's big;\r\n  That wig, which once of curl on curl profuse,\r\n  In well-kept buckle stiff, and smugly spruce,\r\n  Deck'd the plain Pleader; then in nobler taste,\r\n  With well-frizz'd bush the' Attorney-General grac'd;\r\n  And widely waving now with ampler flow,\r\n  Still with thy titles and thy fame shall grow,\r\n  Behold, SIR LLOYD, and while with fond delight\r\n  The dear resemblance feasts thy partial sight,\r\n  Smile, if thou canst; and, smiling on this book,\r\n  Cast the glad omen of one favouring look.\r\n\r\nBut it is on public grounds, that I principally wish to vindicate my\r\nchoice of YOUR HONOUR for my Patron. The ROLLIAD, I have reason\r\nto believe, owed its existence to the [2] memorable speech of the\r\nMember of Devonshire on the first Discussion of the Westminster\r\nScrutiny, when he so emphatically proved himself the genuine\r\ndescendant of DUKE ROLLO; and in the noble contempt which he avowed,\r\nfor the boasted rights of Electors, seemed to breathe the very soul\r\nof his great progenitor, who came to extirpate the liberties of\r\nEnglishmen with the sword. It must be remembered, however, that\r\nYour Honour ministered the occasion to his glory. You, SIR LLOYD,\r\nhave ever been reputed the immediate Author of the Scrutiny. Your\r\nopinion is said to have been privately consulted on the framing of\r\nthe Return; and your public defence of the High-Bailiff's proceeding,\r\nnotoriously furnished MR. ROLLO, and the other friends of the\r\nMinister, with all the little argument, which they advanced against\r\nthe objected exigency of the Writ. You taught them to reverence that\r\nholy thing, the Conscience of a Returning Officer, above all Law,\r\nPrecedent, Analogy, Public Expediency, and the popular Right of\r\nRepresentation, to which our Forefathers erroneously paid religious\r\nrespect, as to the most sacred franchise of our Constitution. You\r\nprevailed on them to manifest an impartiality singularly honourable;\r\nand to prefer the sanctity of this single Conscience, to a round dozen\r\nof the most immaculate consciences, chosen in the purest possible\r\nmanner from their own _pure House of Commons_.\r\n\r\n  Thine is the glorious measure; thine alone:\r\n  Thee father of the Scrutiny, we own.\r\n  Ah! without thee what treasures had we lost,\r\n  More worth than twenty Scrutinies would cost!\r\n  To' instruct the Vestry, and convince the House,\r\n  What Law from MURPHY! what plain sense from ROUS!\r\n  What wit from MULGRAVE! from DUNDAS, what truth!\r\n  What perfect virtue from the VIRTUOUS YOUTH!\r\n  What deep research from ARDEN the profound!\r\n  What argument from BEARCROFT ever sound!\r\n  By MUNCASTER, what generous offers made;\r\n  By HARDINGE, what arithmetic display'd!\r\n  And, oh! what rhetoric, from MAHON that broke\r\n  In printed speeches, which he never spoke!\r\n  Ah! without thee, what worth neglected long,\r\n  Had wanted still its dearest meed of song!\r\n  In vain high-blooded ROLLE, unknown to fame,\r\n  Had boasted still the honours of his name:\r\n  In vain had exercis'd his noble spleen\r\n  On BURKE and FOX--the ROLLIAD had not been.\r\n\r\nBut, alas! SIR LLOYD, at the very moment, while I am writing,\r\nintelligence has reached me, that the Scrutiny is at an end. Your\r\nfavourite measure is no more. The child of your affection has met\r\na sudden and a violent fate. I trust, however, that \"the Ghost of\r\nthe departed Scrutiny\" (in the bold but beautiful language of MR.\r\nDUNDAS) will yet haunt the spot, where it was brought forth, where\r\nit was fostered, and where it fell. Like the Ghost of Hamlet it shall\r\nbe a perturbed spirit, though it may not come in a questionable shape.\r\nIt shall fleet before the eyes of those to whom it was dear,\r\nto admonish them, how they rush into future dangers; to make known\r\nthe secret of its private hoards; or to confess to them the sins of\r\nits former days, and to implore their piety, that they would give\r\npeace to its shade, by making just reparation. Perhaps too, it may\r\nsometimes visit the murderer, like the ghost of Banquo, to dash his\r\njoys. It cannot indeed rise up in its proper form to push him from\r\nhis seat, yet it may assume some other formidable appearance to be\r\nhis eternal tormentor. These, however, are but visionary consolations,\r\nwhile every loyal bosom must feel substantial affliction from the late\r\niniquitous vote, tyrannically compelling the High-Bailiff to make a\r\nreturn after an enquiry of nine months only; especially when you had\r\nso lately armed him with all power necessary to make his enquiry\r\neffectual.\r\n\r\n  [3] Ah! how shall I the' unrighteous vote bewail?\r\n  Again corrupt Majorities prevail.\r\n  Poor CORBETT's Conscience, tho' a little loth,\r\n  Must blindly gape, and gulp the' untasted oath;\r\n  If he, whose conscience never felt a qualm,\r\n  If GROGAN fail the good man's doubts to calm.\r\n  No more shall MORGAN, for his six months' hire,\r\n  Contend, that FOX should share the' expence of fire;\r\n  Whole Sessions shall he _croak_, nor bear away\r\n  The price, that paid the silence of a day:\r\n  No more, till COLLICK some new story hatch,\r\n  Long-winded ROUS for hours shall praise Dispatch;\r\n  COLLICK to Whigs and Warrants back shall slink,\r\n  And ROUS, a Pamphleteer, re-plunge in ink:\r\n  MURPHY again French Comedies shall steal,\r\n  Call them his own, and garble, to conceal;\r\n  Or, pilfering still, and patching without grace\r\n  His thread-bare shreds of Virgil out of place,\r\n  With Dress and Scenery, Attitude and Trick,\r\n  Swords, Daggers, Shouts, and Trumpets in the nick,\r\n  With Ahs! and Ohs! Starts, Pauses, Rant, and Rage,\r\n  Give a new GRECIAN DAUGHTER to the stage:\r\n  But, Oh, SIR CECIL!--Fled to shades again\r\n  From the proud roofs, which here he raised in vain,\r\n  He seeks, unhappy! with the Muse to cheer\r\n  His rising griefs, or drown them in small-beer!\r\n  Alas! the Muse capricious flies the hour\r\n  When most we need her, and the beer is sour:\r\n  Mean time Fox thunders faction uncontroul'd,\r\n  Crown'd with fresh laurels, from new triumphs bold.\r\n\r\nThese general evils arising from the termination of the Scrutiny,\r\nYOUR HONOUR, I doubt not, will sincerely lament in common with all\r\ntrue lovers of their King and Country. But in addition to these, you,\r\nSIR LLOYD, have particular cause to regret, that [4] \"the last hair in\r\nthis tail of procrastination\" is plucked. I well know, what eager\r\nanxiety you felt to establish the suffrage, which you gave, as the\r\ndelegate of your Coach-horses: and I unaffectedly condole with you,\r\nthat you have lost this great opportunity of displaying your\r\nunfathomable knowledge and irresistible logic to the confusion of\r\nyour enemies. How learnedly would you have quoted the memorable\r\ninstance of Darius, who was elected King of Persia by the casting\r\nvote of his Horse! Though indeed the merits of that election have been\r\nsince impeached, not from any alledged illegality of the vote itself,\r\nif it had been fairly given; but because some jockeyship has been\r\nsuspected, and the voter, it has been said, was bribed the night\r\nbefore the election! How ably too would you have applied the case\r\nof Caligula's horse, who was chosen Consul of Rome! For if he was\r\ncapable of being elected (you would have said) _à fortiori_, there\r\ncould have been no natural impediment to his being an elector; since\r\n_omne majus continet in se minus_, and the trust is certainly greater\r\nto fill the first offices of the state, than to have one share among\r\nmany in appointing to them. Neither can I suppose that you would have\r\nomitted so grave and weighty an authority as Captain Gulliver, who,\r\nin the course of his voyages, discovered a country, where Horses\r\ndischarged every Duty of Political Society. You might then have passed\r\nto the early history of our own island, and have expatiated on the\r\nknown veneration in which horses were held by our Saxon Ancestors;\r\nwho, by the way, are supposed also to have been the founders\r\nof Parliaments. You might have touched on their famous standard;\r\ndigressed to the antiquities of the White Horse, in Berkshire, and\r\nother similar monuments in different counties; and from thence have\r\nurged the improbability, that when they instituted elections, they\r\nshould have neglected the rights of an animal, thus highly esteemed\r\nand almost sanctified among them. I am afraid indeed, that with all\r\nyour Religion and Loyalty, you could not have made much use of the\r\nWhite Horse of Death, or the White Horse of Hanover. But, for a\r\n_bonne bouche_, how beautifully might you have introduced your\r\nfavourite maxim of _ubi ratio, ibi jus!_ and to prove the reason of\r\nthe thing, how convincingly might you have descanted, in an elegant\r\npanegyric on the virtues and abilities of horses, from Xanthus the\r\nGrecian Conjuring Horse, whose prophecies are celebrated by Homer,\r\ndown to the Learned Little Horse over Westminster Bridge! with whom\r\nyou might have concluded, lamenting that, as he is not an Elector,\r\nthe Vestry could not have the assistance of one, capable of doing\r\nso much more justice to the question than yourself!--Pardon me,\r\nSIR LLOYD, that I have thus attempted to follow the supposed course\r\nof your oratory. I feel it to be truly inimitable. Yet such was the\r\nimpression made on my mind by some of YOUR HONOUR's late reasonings\r\nrespecting the Scrutiny, that I could not withstand the involuntary\r\nimpulse of endeavouring, for my own improvement, to attain some faint\r\nlikeness of that wonderful pertinency and cogency, which I so much\r\nadmired in the great original.\r\n\r\n  How shall the neighing kind thy deeds requite,\r\n  Great YAHOO Champion of the HOUYHNHNM's right?\r\n  In grateful memory may thy dock-tail pair,\r\n  Unarm'd convey thee with sure-footed care.\r\n  Oh! may they, gently pacing o'er the stones,\r\n  With no rude shock annoy thy batter'd bones,\r\n  Crush thy judicial cauliflow'r, and down\r\n  Shower the mix'd lard and powder o'er thy gown;\r\n  Or in unseemly wrinkles crease that band,\r\n  Fair work of fairer LADY KENYON's hand.\r\n  No!--May the pious brutes, with measur'd swing,\r\n  Assist the friendly motion of the spring,\r\n  While golden dreams of perquisites and fees\r\n  Employ thee, slumbering o'er thine own decrees.\r\n  But when a Statesman in St. Stephen's walls\r\n  Thy Country claims thee, and the Treasury calls,\r\n  To pour thy splendid bile in bitter tide\r\n  On hardened sinners who with Fox divide,\r\n  Then may they, rattling on in jumbling trot,\r\n  With rage and jolting make thee doubly hot,\r\n  Fire thy Welch blood, enflamed with zeal and leeks,\r\n  And kindle the red terrors of thy cheeks,\r\n  Till all thy gather'd wrath in furious fit\r\n  On RIGBY bursts--unless he votes with PITT.\r\n\r\nI might here, SIR LLOYD, launch into a new panegyric on the subject\r\nof this concluding couplet. But in this I shall imitate your\r\nmoderation, who, for reasons best known to yourself, have long\r\nabandoned to MR ROLLE[5] \"those loud and repeated calls on notorious\r\ndefaulters, which will never be forgiven by certain patriots.\"\r\nBesides, I consider your public-spirited behaviour in the late\r\nElection and Scrutiny for Westminster, as the great monument of your\r\nfame to all posterity. I have, therefore, dwelt on this--more\r\nespecially as it was immediately connected with the origin of the\r\nROLLIAD--till my dedication has run to such a length, that I cannot\r\nthink of detaining your valuable time any longer; unless merely to\r\nrequest your HONOUR's zealous protection of a work which may be in\r\nsome sort attributed to you, as its ultimate cause, which is\r\nembellished with your portrait, and which now records in this address,\r\nthe most brilliant exploit of your political glory.\r\n\r\n  Choak'd by _a Roll_, 'tis said, that OTWAY died;\r\n  OTWAY the Tragic Muse's tender pride.\r\n  Oh! may my ROLLE to me, thus favour'd, give\r\n  A better fate;--that I may eat, and live!\r\n\r\n  I am, YOUR HONOUR's\r\n    Most obedient,\r\n      Most respectful,\r\n        Most devoted, humble servant,\r\n                             THE EDITOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] In a postscript originally subjoined to the eighth Number.\r\n\r\n[2] Mr. Rolle said, \"he could not be kept all the summer debating\r\nabout the rights of the Westminster electors. His private concerns\r\nwere of more importance to him; than his right as a Westminster\r\nElector.\"\r\n\r\n[3] I shall give the Reader in one continued note, what information\r\nI think necessary for understanding these verses. During the six\r\nmonths that the Scrutiny continued in St. Martin's, the most\r\ndistinguished exhibition of Mr. Morgan's talents was the maintenance\r\nof an argument, that Mr. Fox ought to pay half the expence of fire\r\nin the room where the Witnesses attended. The learned Gentleman is\r\nfamiliarly called _Frog_, to which I presume the Author alludes in\r\nthe word _croak_. Mr. Rous spoke two hours to recommend Expedition.\r\nAt the time the late Parliament was dissolved, he wrote two Pamphlets\r\nin favour of the Ministry. I have forgot the titles of these\r\npamphlets, as probably the reader has too, if he ever knew them.\r\nHowever, I can assure him of the fact.--Mr. Collick, the\r\nWitness-General of Sir Cecil Wray, is a Hair-Merchant and Justice\r\nof Peace. Sir Cecil's taste both for Poetry and Small-beer are well\r\nknown, as is the present unfinished state of his newly-fronted house in\r\nPall-Mall.\r\n\r\n[4] \"This appears to be the last hair in the tail of procrastination\"\r\nThe Master of the Rolls, who first used this phrase, is a most\r\neloquent speaker. See Lord Mulg. Essays on Eloquence, Vol. II.\r\n\r\n[5] Mr. Ridgway tells me, he thinks there is something like these\r\nwords in one of the Reviews, where the ROLLIAD is criticised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHORT ACCOUNT\r\nOF THE FAMILY OF THE\r\nROLLOS, _now_ ROLLES,\r\nFAITHFULLY EXTRACTED FROM THE\r\nRECORDS OF THE HERALD'S OFFICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN ROLLE, Esq. is descended from the ancient Duke ROLLO, of\r\nNormandy; ROLLO passed over into Britain, anno 983, where he soon\r\nbegat another ROLLO, upon the wife of a Saxon drummer. Our young ROLLO\r\nwas distinguished by his gigantic stature, and, as we learn from\r\nODERICUS VITALIS, was slain by Hildebrand, the Danish Champion,\r\nin a fit of jealousy. We find in Camden, that the race of the ROLLOS\r\nfell into adversity in the reign of Stephen, and in the succeeding\r\nreign, GASPAR DE ROLLO was an Ostler in Denbighshire.--But during\r\nthe unhappy contests of York and Lancaster, William de Wyrcester,\r\nand the continuator of the annals of Croyland, have it, that the\r\nROLLOS became Scheriffes of Devon. \"_Scheriffi Devonienses_ ROLLI\r\n_fuerunt_\"--and in another passage, \"_arrestaverunt Debitores plurime_\r\nROLLORUM\"--hence a doubt in Fabian, whether this ROLLO was not\r\nBailiff, _ipse potius quam Scheriffus_. From this period, however,\r\nthey gradually advanced in circumstances; ROLLO, in Henry the VIIIth,\r\nbeing amerced in 800 marks for pilfering two manchetts of beef from\r\nthe King's buttery, the which, saith Selden, _facillime payavit_.\r\n\r\nIn 7th and 8th of Phil. and Mar. three ROLLOS indeed were gibetted for\r\npiracy, and from that date the family changed the final O of the name\r\ninto an E. In the latter annals of the ROLLOS now ROLLES, but little\r\nof consequence is handed down to us. We have it that TIMOTHY ROLLE\r\nof Plympton, in the 8th of Queen Anne, endowed three alms-houses\r\nin said town. JEREMIAH his second son was counted the fattest man of\r\nhis day, and DOROTHEA ROLLE his third cousin died of a terrible\r\ndysentery. From this period the ROLLES have burst upon public notice,\r\nwith such a blaze of splendour, as renders all further accounts of\r\nthis illustrious race entirely unnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACT FROM THE DEDICATION\r\nOF THE\r\nROLLIAD.\r\nAN\r\n_EPIC POEM_,\r\nIN\r\nTWELVE BOOKS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  When Norman ROLLO sought fair Albion's coast,\r\n  (Long may his offspring prove their country's boast!)\r\n  Thy genius, Britain, sure inspir'd his soul\r\n  To bless this Island with the race of ROLLE!\r\n  Illustrious ROLLE!

The action is\r\none, entire and great event, being the procreation of a child on the\r\nwife of a Saxon Drummer. The Poem opens with a most laboured and\r\nmasterly description of a storm. ROLLO's state of mind in this arduous\r\nsituation is finely painted:\r\n\r\n  Now ROLLO storms more loudly than the wind,\r\n  Now doubts and black despair perplex his mind;\r\n  Hopeless to see his vessel safely harbour'd,\r\n  He hardly knows his starboard for his larboard!\r\n\r\nThat a hero in distress should not know his right hand from his left,\r\nis most natural and affecting; in other hands, indeed, it would not\r\nhave appeared sufficiently poetical, but the technical expressions\r\nof our author convey the idea in all the blaze of metaphor. The storm\r\nat length subsides, and ROLLO is safely landed on the coast of Sussex.\r\nHis first exploit, like that of Æneas, is deer-stealing. He then sets\r\nout in the disguise of a Sussex Smuggler, to obtain intelligence of\r\nthe country and its inhabitants:\r\n\r\n  Wrapt in a close great-coat, he plods along;\r\n  A seeming Smuggler, to deceive the throng.\r\n\r\nThis expedient of the Smuggler's Great-coat, we must acknowledge,\r\nis not quite so Epic, as the veil of clouds, with which Minerva in\r\nthe Odyssey, and Venus, in the Æneid, surround their respective\r\nheroes. It is, however, infinitely more natural, and gains in\r\npropriety, what it loses in sublimity. Thus disguised, our adventurer\r\narrives at the Country-house of Dame SHIPTON, a lady of exquisite\r\nbeauty, and first Concubine to the Usurper HAROLD. Her likeness\r\n(as we all know) is still preserved at the wax-work in Fleet-Street.\r\nTo this lady ROLLO discovers himself, and is received by her in\r\nthe most hospitable manner. At supper, he relates to her, with great\r\nmodesty, his former actions, and his design of conquering England;\r\nin which (charmed with the grace with which he eats and tells stories)\r\nshe promises to assist him, and they set off together for London.\r\nIn the third book Dame SHIPTON, or, as the author styles her,\r\nSHIPTONIA, proposes a party to the puppet-show; on the walk they are\r\nsurprised by a shower, and retire under Temple-bar, where Shiptonia\r\nforgets her fidelity to Harold. We are sorry to observe, that this\r\nincident is not sufficiently poetical; nor does Shiptonia part with\r\nher chastity in so solemn a manner as Dido in the Æneid. In the\r\nopening of the fourth book, likewise, we think our author inferior\r\nto Virgil, whom he exactly copies, and in some places translates;\r\nhe begins in this manner:\r\n\r\n  But now (for thus it was decreed above)\r\n  SHIPTONIA falls excessively in love;\r\n  In every vein, great ROLLO's eyes and fame\r\n  Light up, and then add fuel to the flame!\r\n  His words, his beauty, stick within her breast,\r\n  Nor do her cares afford her any rest.\r\n\r\nHere we think that Virgil's \"hærent infixi pectore vultus verbaque,\"\r\nis ill translated by the prosaic word _stick_. We must confess,\r\nhowever, that from the despair and death of Shiptonia, to the battle\r\nof Hastings, in which ROLLO kills with his own hand the Saxon Drummer,\r\nand carries off his wife, the Poem abounds with beautiful details,\r\ncold-blooded matter of facts. Critics may perhaps object that it\r\nappears from the Genealogy of the Rollos, Duke ROLLO came to England\r\nmore than 60 years before the battle of Hastings: though the Poet\r\nrepresents him as the principal hero in that memorable engagement.\r\nBut such deviations from history are among the common licences\r\nof poetry. Thus Virgil, for the sake of a beautiful episode, makes\r\nDido live in the time of Æneas, whereas she lived in reality\r\n200 years before the Trojan war; and if authority more in point be\r\ndesired, Mr. Cumberland wrote a Tragedy, called the Battle of\r\nHastings, in which there was not a single event, except the death of\r\nHarold, that had the slightest foundation in historical facts, or even\r\nprobability.\r\n\r\nBut the sixth book, in which ROLLO, almost despairing of success,\r\ndescends into a Night Cellar to consult the illustrious MERLIN on\r\nhis future destiny, is a master-piece of elegance. In this book,\r\nas the Philosopher's magic lantern exhibits the characters of all\r\nROLLO's descendants, and even all those who are to act on the same\r\nstage with the Marcellus of the piece, the present illustrious\r\nMr. ROLLE, we mean to select in our next number some of the most\r\nstriking passages of this inexhaustible Magazine of Poetry!\r\n\r\n                    *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n_NUMBER II._\r\n\r\nOur author, after giving an account of the immediate descendants of\r\nROLLO, finds himself considerably embarrassed by the three unfortunate\r\nROLLOS[1], whom history relates to have been hanged. From this\r\ndifficulty, however, he relieves himself, by a contrivance equally new\r\nand arduous, viz. by versifying the bill of indictment, and inserting\r\nin it a flaw, by which they are saved from condemnation. But in the\r\ntransactions of those early times, however dignified the phraseology,\r\nand enlivened by fancy, there is little to amaze and less to interest;\r\nlet us hasten, therefore, to those characters about whom not to be\r\nsolicitous, is to want curiosity, and whom not to admire, is to want\r\ngratitude--to those characters, in short, whose splendour illuminates\r\nthe present House of Commons.\r\n\r\nOf these, our author's principal favourite appears to be that\r\namiable[2] young Nobleman, whose Diary we have all perused with\r\nso much pleasure. Of him he says,--\r\n\r\n  ------Superior to abuse,\r\n  He nobly glories in the name of GOOSE;\r\n  Such Geese at Rome from the perfidious Gaul\r\n  Preserv'd the Treas'ry-Bench and Capitol, &c. &c.\r\n\r\nIn the description of Lord MAHON, our author departs a little from\r\nhis wonted gravity,--\r\n\r\n  ------This Quixote of the Nation,\r\n  Beats his own Windmills in gesticulation,\r\n  To _Strike_, not _please_, his utmost force he bends,\r\n  And all his sense is at his fingers ends, &c. &c.\r\n\r\nBut the most beautiful effort of our author's genius (if we\r\nexcept only the character of Mr. ROLLE himself) is contained\r\nin the description of Mr. PITT.\r\n\r\n  Pert without fire, without experience sage,\r\n  Young with more art than SHELBURNE glean'd from age,\r\n  loo proud from pilfer'd greatness to descend,\r\n  Too humble not to call DUNDAS his friend,\r\n  In solemn dignity and sullen state,\r\n  This new Octavius rises to debate!\r\n  Mild and more mild he sees each placid row\r\n  Of Country Gentlemen with rapture glow;\r\n  He sees, convuls'd with sympathetic throbs,\r\n  Apprentice Peers, and deputy Nabobs!\r\n  Nor Rum Contractors think his speech too long,\r\n  While words, like treacle, trickle from his Tongue!\r\n  O Soul congenial to the Souls of ROLLES!\r\n  Whether you tax the luxury of Coals,\r\n  Or vote some necessary millions more,\r\n  To feed an Indian friend's exhausted store,\r\n  Fain would I praise (if I like thee could praise)\r\n  Thy matchless virtues in congenial lays.\r\n  But, Ah! too weak, &c. &c.\r\n\r\nThis apology, however, is like the _nolo episcopari_ of Bishops;\r\nfor our author continues his panegyric during about one hundred\r\nand fifty lines more, after which he proceeds to a task (as he says)\r\nmore congenial to his abilities, and paints\r\n\r\n  ------in smooth confectionary style,\r\n  The simpering sadness of his MULGRAVE's smile.\r\n\r\nFrom the character of this nobleman we shall only select a part of\r\none couplet, which tends to elucidate our author's astonishing powers\r\nin imitative harmony,\r\n\r\n  ------\"within his lab'ring throat\r\n  The shrill shriek struggles with the harsh hoarse note.\"\r\n\r\nAs we mean to excite, and not to satisfy at once the curiosity of our\r\nreaders, we shall here put a period to our extracts for the present.\r\nWe cannot, however, conclude this essay, without observing, that there\r\nare very few lines in the whole work which are at all inferior to\r\nthose we have selected for the entertainment of our readers.\r\n\r\n[1] See the Genealogy, p. xxvii, xxviii.\r\n\r\n[2] Lord Graham.\r\n\r\n                    *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n_NUMBER III._\r\n\r\nIn proof of the assurance with which we concluded our last number,\r\nwe shall now proceed to give the character of SIR RICHARD HILL.\r\n\r\nOur Readers, probably, are well acquainted with the worthy Baronet's\r\npromiscuous quotations from the Bible and Rochester; and they may\r\npossibly remember (if they were awake, when they read them) some\r\nelegant verses, which he repeated in the House of Commons, and\r\nafterwards inserted in the public papers, as the production of a\r\nsleepless Night. We know not, however, if they may so easily recal\r\nto mind his remarkable declaration, both of his Loyalty and Religion,\r\nin the prettily-turned phrase, \"that indeed he loved King GEORGE\r\nvery well, but he loved King JESUS better.\" But as our Poet has\r\nalluded to it, we thought necessary to mention it; and for the same\r\nreason to add, that like Lord MAHON, Major SCOTT, Mr. ATKINSON,\r\nMr. WILKES, and Captain J. LUTTRELL, he writes his own speeches for\r\nthe public Reporters. We should also have been happy to have enlivened\r\nour commentary with some extracts from the controversy, at which our\r\nAuthor glances; we mean the answer of Sir Richard to Mr. Madan, on the\r\ndoctrine of Polygamy; a subject, which the tenour of our Baronet's\r\nreading in his two favourite books, peculiarly qualified him to handle\r\nwith equally pleasantry and orthodoxy. But all our industry to procure\r\nhis pamphlet unfortunately proved ineffectual. We never saw more of it\r\nthan the title-page, which we formerly purchased in the lining of\r\na trunk, at the corner of St. Paul's Church-yard.\r\n\r\nWe are conscious, that these introductory explanations must seem\r\ndoubly dull, to Readers impatient for such exquisite poetry as\r\nthe ROLLIAD. They appeared, however, indispensible to the due\r\nunderstanding of the verses, which we shall now give without\r\nfurther preface.\r\n\r\n  Brother of ROWLAND, or, if yet more dear\r\n  Sounds thy new title, Cousin of a Peer;\r\n  Scholar of various learning, good or evil,\r\n  Alike what God inspir'd, or what the Devil;\r\n  Speaker well skill'd, what no man hears, to write;\r\n  Sleep-giving Poet, of a sleepless night;\r\n  Polemic, Politician, Saint, and Wit,\r\n  Now lashing MADAN, now defending PITT;\r\n  Thy praise shall live till time itself be o'er,\r\n  Friend of King GEORGE, tho' of King JESUS more!\r\n\r\nThe solemnity of this opening is well suited to the dignity of\r\nthe occasion. The heroes of Homer generally address each other by\r\nan appellative, marking their affinity to some illustrious personage.\r\nThe Grecian poet, it must be confessed, in such cases, uses a\r\npatronymic, expressive of the genealogy; as _Pelides_, _Æacides_,\r\n_Laertiades_; but it is not absolutely necessary to observe this\r\nrule.--For, [1]M'Pherson, a poet with whom our author is most likely to\r\nbe intimately acquainted, makes his hero, Fingal, address Ossian by\r\nthe title of \"Father of Oscar.\" It should seem therefore to be\r\nsufficient, if in addressing a great man, you particularise any\r\ncelebrated character of the family who may be supposed to reflect\r\nhonour on his connections; and the Reverend ROWLAND HILL was certainly\r\nthe most celebrated of our worthy Baronet's relations, before the\r\nlate creation of Lord BERWICK, on which the next line happily touches.\r\n\r\nOur author seems very fond of Mr. DUNDAS,\r\n\r\n              Whose exalted soul\r\n  No bonds of vulgar prejudice controul.\r\n  Of shame unconscious in his bold career,\r\n  He spurns that honour, which the weak revere;\r\n  For, true to public Virtue's patriot plan,\r\n  He loves _the Minister_, and not _the Man_;\r\n  Alike the advocate of NORTH and Wit,\r\n  The friend of SHELBURNE, and the guide of PITT,\r\n  His ready tongue with sophistries at will,\r\n  Can say, unsay, and be consistent still;\r\n  This day can censure, and the next retract,\r\n  In speech extol, and stigmatize in act;\r\n  Turn and re-turn; whole hours at HASTINGS bawl,\r\n  Defend, praise, thank, affront him, and recal.\r\n  By opposition, he his King shall court;\r\n  And damn the People's cause by his support.\r\n  He, like some Angel sent to scourge mankind,\r\n  Shall deal forth plagues,--in charity design'd.\r\n  The West he would have starv'd; yet, ever good,\r\n  But meant to save the effusion of her blood:\r\n  And if, from fears of his Controul releast\r\n  He looses Rapine now, to spoil the East;\r\n  'Tis but to fire another SYKES to plan\r\n  Some new starvation-scheme for Hindostan;\r\n  Secure, to make her flourish, as before,\r\n  More populous, by losing myriads more.\r\n\r\nOur author here seems to understand the famous starvation-scheme\r\nof Mr. DUNDAS, as literally designed to produce an actual famine\r\nin America, though undoubtedly from the most benevolent motives\r\nimaginable. But this is contradicted by a [2]late writer, who appears\r\nto be perfectly conversant with the language and purposes of our\r\npresent men in power. \"Starvation (says he) is not synonymous\r\nwith famine; for Mr. Dundas most certainly could not intend to produce\r\na famine in America, which is the granary of the West-Indies, and of\r\na great part of Europe. The word Starvation (continues he) was\r\nintended by Mr. Dundas to express a scheme of his own, by which he\r\nmeant to prevent the Americans from eating when they were hungry,\r\nand had food within their reach; thereby insuring their reduction\r\nwithout blood-shed.\" However, both authors agree that Mr. Dundas\r\nproposed to starve the Americans (whatever was to be the mode of\r\ndoing it) in mere compassion, to save them from the horrors of\r\nthroat-cutting. How finely too does the Poet trace the same charitable\r\ndisposition in the late measures of Mr. Dundas and his Colleagues\r\nat the Board of Controul! Factious men have said, that the Indian\r\npolitics of the new Commissioners have a direct tendency, beyond any\r\nformer system, to encourage every kind of peculation and extortion.\r\nBut what kind Mr. Dundas would peculiarly wish to encourage, can admit\r\nof no doubt, from his known partiality to starving--any body,\r\nbut himself. And how, indeed, can the prosperity of the East be\r\nbetter consulted, than by some new starvation-scheme; such as was\r\ncontrived and executed by certain humane individuals in the year 1770,\r\nwith the most salutary event! For, notwithstanding one-third of\r\nthe inhabitants of Bengal were then swept away by the famine,\r\nthe province, in consequence, is now become more populous than ever.\r\nThis may a little disturb all vulgar notions of cause and effect;\r\nbut the writer above-mentioned proves the fact, by the testimony\r\nof Major Scott.\r\n\r\nThere are many more lines relating to Mr. Dundas. But as this\r\ngentleman's character is so perfectly understood by the public,\r\nwe shall rather select a short catalogue of some among the inferior\r\nMinisterial Heroes, who have hitherto been less frequently described.\r\n\r\n  DRAKE, whose cold rhetorick freezes in its course,\r\n  BANKS the precise, and fluent WILBERFORCE,\r\n  With either PHIPPS, a scribbling, prattling pair;\r\n  And VILLERS, comely, with the flaxen hair;\r\n  The gentle GRENVILLE's ever-grinning Son,\r\n  And the dark brow of solemn HAMILTON.\r\n\r\nThese miniatures, as we may call them, present us with very striking\r\nlikenesses of the living originals; most of whom are seen to as much\r\nadvantage in this small size, as they could possibly have been,\r\nhad they been taken at full length. How happy is the allusion to\r\nMr. DRAKE's[3] well-known speech; which, in the metaphor of our poet,\r\nwe may style a beautiful icicle of the most transparent eloquence!\r\nHow just too, and yet how concise, is the description of the literary\r\nand parliamentary talents, so equally possessed by Brother CHARLES\r\nand Brother HARRY, as Lord Mulgrave affectionately calls them.\r\nWe must, however, observe, that in the Manuscript of the ROLLIAD,\r\nobligingly communicated to us by the Author, the line appears to have\r\nbeen first written,\r\n\r\n  Resplendent PHIPPS who shines our lesser Bear;\r\n\r\nthe noble head of this illustrious family having been called\r\nthe Great Bear. But this was corrected probably in consequence\r\nof the Poet having discovered, like Mr. Herschel, that the splendor\r\nwhich he long attributed to a single constellation, or (if we may\r\ndepart a little from critical nicety in our figure) to a single star,\r\nin reality flowed from the united rays of two. We have nothing\r\nfurther to add on this passage, only that the character of VILLERS\r\nseems to be drawn after the Nireus of Homer; who, as the Commentators\r\nremark, is celebrated in the catalogue of warriors, for the handsomest\r\nman in the Grecian army, and is never mentioned again through the\r\nwhole twenty-four books of the Iliad.\r\n\r\n[1] Mr. M'Pherson is said to be one of the principal writers on\r\nthe side of the present administration.\r\n\r\n[2] Key to Parliamentary Debates, published by Debrett.\r\n\r\n[3] \"Behold, Sir, another feature of the procrastinating system.\r\nNot so the Athenian Patriots--Sir, the Romans--Sir, I have lost\r\nthe clue of my argument--Sir, I will sit down.\"\r\n\r\n                    *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n_NUMBER IV._\r\n\r\nA new edition (being the nineteenth) of this universally admired poem\r\nhaving been recently published, the ingenious author has taken that\r\nopportunity to introduce some new lines on an occasion perfectly\r\ncongenial to his muse, and in the highest degree interesting to\r\nthe public, namely, the late Fast and Thanksgiving; together with\r\nthe famous discourse preached in celebration of that day by that\r\nillustrious orator and divine, the Reverend Mr. SECRETARY\r\nPRETTYMAN.--This episode, which is emphatically termed by himself in\r\nhis prefatory address to this last edition, his Episode Parsonic,\r\nseems to have been written perfectly _con amore_, and is considered\r\nby critics as one of the happiest effusions of the distinguished\r\ngenius from whose high-rapped fancy it originated. It consists of\r\nnine-and-forty lines, of which, without farther exordium, we shall\r\nsubmit the following extracts to the inspection, or, more properly\r\nspeaking, the admiration of our readers. He sets out with a most\r\nspirited compliment to Dr. PRETTYMAN. The two first lines are\r\nconsidered by critics, as the most successful example of the\r\nalliterative ornament upon record.\r\n\r\n  Prim Preacher, Prince of Priests, and [1]Prince's Priest;\r\n  Pembroke's pale pride--in PITT's _præcordia_ plac'd.\r\n  --Thy merits all shall future ages scan,\r\n  And PRINCE be lost in PARSON PRETTYMAN.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of the historical allusion to Prince Prettyman, need not\r\nbe pointed out to our readers; and the presage that the fame of this\r\nRoyal personage shall be lost and absorbed in the rising reputation\r\nof the ingenious divine, is peculiarly happy and well turned.\r\nThe celebrated passage of Virgil,\r\n\r\n  \"Tu Marcellus eris:\"\r\n\r\nis supposed to have been in the poet's recollection at the moment\r\nof his conceiving this passage--not that the\r\n\r\n  \"Oh miserande puer!\"\r\n\r\nin the preceding line, is imagined to have excited any idea of Mr.\r\nPitt.\r\n\r\nOur author now pursues his hero to the pulpit, and there, in imitation\r\nof Homer, who always takes the opportunity for giving a minute\r\ndescription of his _personæ_, when they are on the very verge of\r\nentering upon an engagement, he gives a laboured but animated detail\r\nof the Doctor's personal manners and deportment. Speaking of the\r\npenetrating countenance for which the Doctor is distinguished, he\r\nsays,\r\n\r\n  ARGUS could boast an hundred eyes, 'tis true,            }\r\n  The DOCTOR looks an hundreds ways with two:              }\r\n  Gimlets they are, and bore you through and through.      }\r\n\r\nThis is a very elegant and classic compliment, and shows clearly\r\nwhat a decided advantage our Reverend Hero possesses over the\r\ncelebrated {Ophthalmodoulos} of antiquity. Addison is justly famous\r\nin the literary world, for the judgment with which he selects and\r\napplies familiar words to great occasions, as in the instances:\r\n\r\n  ------\"The great, the important day,\r\n  \"_Big_ with the fate of Cato and of Rome.\"--\r\n\r\n  \"The sun grows _dim_ with age, &c. &c.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a very great beauty, for it fares with ideas, as with\r\nindividuals; we are the more interested in their fate, the better\r\nwe are acquainted with them. But how inferior is Addison in this\r\nrespect to our author?\r\n\r\n  Gimlets they are, &c.\r\n\r\nThere is not such a word in all Cato! How well-known and domestic\r\nthe image! How specific and forcible the application!--Our author\r\nproceeds: Having described very accurately the style of the Doctor's\r\nhairdressing, and devoted ten beautiful lines to an eulogy upon\r\nthe brilliant on the little finger of his right hand, of which\r\nhe emphatically says:\r\n\r\n  No veal putrescent, no dead whiting's eye,\r\n  In the true water with this ring could vie;\r\n\r\nhe breaks out into the following most inspirited and vigorous\r\napostrophe--\r\n\r\n  Oh! had you seen his lily, lily hand,\r\n  Stroke his spare cheek, and coax his snow-white band:\r\n  That adding force to all his powers of speech,\r\n  This the protector of his sacred breech;\r\n  That point the way to Heav'n's coelestial grace,\r\n  This keep his small-clothes in their proper place--\r\n  Oh! how the comley preacher you had prais'd,\r\n  As now the right, and now the left he rais'd!!!\r\n\r\nWho does not perceive, in this description, as if before their eyes,\r\nthe thin figure of emaciated divinity, divided between religion\r\nand decorum; anxious to produce some truths, and conceal others;\r\nat once concerned for _fundamental_ points of various kinds; ever at\r\nthe _bottom_ of things--Who does not see this, and seeing, who does\r\nnot admire? The notes that accompany this excellent episode, contain\r\nadmirable instances of our author's profound knowledge in all\r\nthe literature of our established religion; and we are sorry that\r\nour plan will not suffer us to produce them, as a full and decisive\r\nproof that his learning is perfectly on a level with his genius,\r\nand his divinity quite equal to his poetry.\r\n\r\n[1] The Doctor is Chaplain to his Majesty.--He was bred at\r\nPembroke-hall in Cambridge.\r\n\r\n                    *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n_NUMBER V._\r\n\r\nOn Monday last, the twentieth edition of this incomparable poem\r\nmade its appearance: and we may safely venture to predict, that,\r\nshould it be followed by an hundred more, while the fertile and\r\ninexhaustible genius of the author continues to enrich every new\r\nedition with new beauties, they will not fail to run through,\r\nwith the same rapidity that the former have done; so universal\r\nis the enthusiasm prevailing among the genuine lovers of poetry,\r\nand all persons of acknowledged taste, with respect to this wonderful\r\nand unparalleled production.\r\n\r\nWhat chiefly distinguishes this edition, and renders it peculiarly\r\ninteresting at the present moment, is the admirable description\r\ncontained in it of the newly-appointed India Board; in which the\r\ncharacters of the members composing it are most happily, though\r\nperhaps somewhat severely, contrasted with those to whom the same\r\nhigh office had been allotted by a former administration.\r\n\r\nThat the feelings of the public are in unison with those of our author\r\nupon this occasion, is sufficiently apparent from the frequent\r\nPanegyrics with which the public papers have of late been filled,\r\nupon the characters of these distinguished personages. In truth,\r\nthe superiority of our present excellent administration over their\r\nopponents, can in no instance be more clearly demonstrated, than by a\r\ncandid examination of the comparative merits of the persons appointed\r\nby each of them to preside in this arduous and important department.\r\n\r\nOur author opens this comparison by the following elegant compliment\r\nto the accomplished Nobleman whose situation, as Secretary of State,\r\nentitles him to a priority of notice, as the eminence of his abilities\r\nwill ever ensure him a due superiority of weight in the deliberations\r\nof the board.\r\n\r\n  SYDNEY, whom all the pow'rs of rhetoric grace.\r\n  Consistent SYDNEY fills FITZWILLIAM's place;\r\n  O, had by nature but proportion'd been\r\n  His strength of genius to his length of chin,\r\n  His mighty mind in some prodigious plan\r\n  At once with ease had reach'd to Indostan!\r\n\r\nThe idea conveyed in these lines, of the possibility of a feature\r\nin the human face extending to so prodigious a distance as the\r\nEast-Indies, has been objected to as some-what hyperbolical. But those\r\nwho are well acquainted with the person as well as the character of\r\nthe noble lord alluded to, and who are unquestionably the best judges\r\nof the _extent_ of the compliment, will certainly be of a different\r\nopinion. Neither indeed is the objection founded in truth, but must\r\nhave arisen merely from the passage not having been properly\r\nunderstood. It by no means supposes his Lordship to have literally a\r\nchin of such preposterous dimensions, as must be imagined for the\r\npurpose of reaching to the East-Indies; but figuratively speaking,\r\nonly purports, that, if his Lordship's mental, faculties are\r\nco-extensive with that distinguished feature of his face, they may\r\nreadily embrace, and be competent to the consideration of the most\r\ndistant objects. The meaning of the author is so obvious, that this\r\ncavil probably originated in wilful misapprehension, with a view of\r\ndetracting from the merit of one of the most beautiful passages in\r\nthe whole poem.\r\n\r\nWhat reader can refuse his admiration to the following lines, in which\r\nthe leading features of the characters are so justly, strongly, and\r\nat the same time so concisely delineated?\r\n\r\n  Acute observers, who with skilful ken\r\n  Descry the characters of public men,\r\n  Rejoice that pow'r and patronage should pass\r\n  From _jobbing_ MONTAGUE to _pure_ DUNDAS;\r\n  Exchange with pleasure, ELLIOT, LEW'SHAM, NORTH,\r\n  For MULGRAVE's tried integrity and worth;\r\n  And all must own, that worth completely tried,\r\n  By turns experienc'd upon every side.\r\n\r\nHow happy is the selection of epithets in these lines! How forcibly\r\ndescriptive of the character to which they are applied! In the same\r\nstrain he proceeds:--\r\n\r\n    Whate'er experience GREGORY might boast,\r\n    Say, is not WALSINGHAM himself a host?\r\n    His grateful countrymen, with joyful eyes,\r\n    From SACKVILLE's ashes see this Phoenix rise:\r\n    Perhaps with all his master's talents blest,\r\n    To save the East as he subdu'd the West.\r\n\r\nThe historical allusion is here judiciously introduced; and the\r\npleasing prospect hinted at of the same happy issue attending our\r\naffairs in the Eastern, that has already crowned them in the\r\nWestern world, must afford peculiar satisfaction to the feelings\r\nof every British reader.\r\n\r\nThe next character is most ingeniously described, but like a\r\nformer one, containing some _personal_ allusions, requires, in order\r\nto be fully understood, a more intimate acquaintance with the exterior\r\nqualifications of the gentleman in question, than can have fallen\r\nto the lot of every reader. All who have had the pleasure of\r\nseeing him, however, will immediately acknowledge the resemblance\r\nof the portrait.\r\n\r\n  See next advance, in knowing FLETCHER's stead,\r\n  A youth, who boasts no common share of head;\r\n  What plenteous stores of knowledge may contain\r\n  The spacious tenement of GRENVILLE's brain!\r\n  Nature, in all her dispensations wise,\r\n  Who form'd his head-piece of so vast a size,\r\n  Hath not, 'tis true, neglected to bestow\r\n  Its due proportion to the part below;\r\n  And hence we reason, that, to serve the state,\r\n  His top and bottom may have equal weight.\r\n\r\nEvery reader will naturally conceive, that in the description of\r\nthe principal person of the board, the author has exerted the\r\nwhole force of his genius, and he will not find his expectations\r\ndisappointed; he has reserved him for the last, and has judiciously\r\nevaded disgracing him by a comparison with any other, upon the\r\nprinciple, no doubt, quoted from Mr. Theobald, by that excellent\r\ncritic, Martinus Scriblerus:\r\n\r\n  \"None but himself can be his parallel.\"\r\n                                      DOUBLE FALSEHOOD.\r\n\r\nAs he has drawn this character at considerable length, we shall\r\ncontent ourselves with selecting some few of the most striking\r\npassages, whatever may be the difficulty of selecting where almost\r\nthe whole is equally beautiful. The grandeur of the opening prepares\r\nthe mind for the sublime sensations suitable to the dignity of a\r\nsubject so exalted:\r\n\r\n  Above the rest, majestically great,\r\n  Behold the infant Atlas of the state,\r\n  The matchless miracle of modern days,\r\n  In whom Britannia to the world displays\r\n  A sight to make surrounding nations stare;\r\n  A kingdom trusted to a school-boy's care.\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed to the credit of our author, that, although his\r\npolitical principles are unquestionably favourable to the present\r\nhappy government, he does not scruple, with that boldness which\r\never characterises real genius, to animadvert with freedom on persons\r\nof the most elevated rank and station; and he has accordingly\r\ninterspersed his commendations of our favourite young Minister with\r\nmuch excellent and reasonable counsel, fore-warning him of the dangers\r\nto which he is by his situation exposed. After having mentioned his\r\nintroduction into public life, and concurred in that admirable\r\npanegyric of his immaculate virtues, made in the House of Commons by\r\na noble Lord already celebrated in the poem, upon which he has the\r\nfollowing observation:\r\n\r\n  ------As MULGRAVE, who so fit\r\n  To chaunt the praises of ingenious PITT?\r\n  The nymph unhackney'd and unknown abroad,\r\n  Is thus commended by the hackney'd bawd.\r\n  The dupe enraptur'd, views her fancied charms,\r\n  And clasps the maiden mischief to his arms,\r\n  Till dire disease reveals the truth too late:\r\n  O grant my country, Heav'n, a milder fate!\r\n\r\nhe attends him to the high and distinguished station he now so ably\r\nfills, and, in a nervous strain of manly eloquence, describes the\r\ndefects of character and conduct to which his situation, and the means\r\nby which he came to it, render him peculiarly liable. The spirit of\r\nthe following lines is remarkable:\r\n\r\n  Oft in one bosom may be found allied,\r\n  Excess of meanness, and excess of pride:\r\n  Oft may the Statesman, in St. Stephen's brave,\r\n  Sink in St. James's to an abject slave;\r\n  Erect and proud at Westminster, may fall\r\n  Prostrate and pitiful at Leadenhall;\r\n  In word a giant, though a dwarf in deed,\r\n  Be led by others while he seems to lead.\r\n\r\nHe afterwards with great force describes the lamentable state of\r\nhumiliation into which he may fall from his present pinnacle of\r\ngreatness, by too great a subserviency to those from whom he has\r\nderived it, and appeals to his pride in the following beautiful\r\nexclamation:\r\n\r\n    Shall CHATHAM's offspring basely beg support,\r\n    Now from the India, now St. James's court;\r\n    With pow'r admiring Senates to bewitch,\r\n    Now kiss a Monarch's--now a Merchant's breech;\r\n    And prove a pupil of St. Omer's school,\r\n    Of either KINSON, AT. or JEN. the tool?\r\n\r\nThough cold and cautious criticism may perhaps stare at the boldness\r\nof the concluding line, we will venture to pronounce it the most\r\nmasterly stroke of the sublime to be met with in this, or any other\r\npoem. It may be justly said, as Mr. Pope has so happily expressed it--\r\n\r\n  \"To snatch a grace beyond the reach of art.\"\r\n                                    ESSAY ON CRITICISM.\r\n\r\nAs we despair of offering any thing equal to this lofty flight of\r\ngenius to the reader of true taste, we shall conclude with\r\nrecommending to him the immediate perusal of the whole poem, and, in\r\nthe name of an admiring public, returning our heart-felt thanks to the\r\nwonderful author of this invaluable work.\r\n\r\n                    *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n_NUMBER VI._\r\n\r\nIn our two last numbers we were happy to give our readers the earliest\r\nrelish of those additional beauties, with which the nineteenth and\r\ntwentieth impressions of the ROLLIAD are enriched. And these\r\ninterpolations we doubt not have been sufficiently admired for their\r\nintrinsic merit, even in their detached state, as we gave them. But\r\nwhat superior satisfaction must they have afforded to those who have\r\nread them in their proper places! They are parts of a whole, and as\r\nsuch wonderfully improve the effect of the general design, by an\r\nagreeable interruption of prosaic regularity.\r\n\r\nThis may appear to some but a paradoxical kind of improvement, which\r\nis subversive of order. It must be remembered, however, that the\r\ndescent of ROLLO to the night-cellar was undoubtedly suggested by the\r\ndescent of Æneas to hell in the Sixth Book of Virgil; and every\r\nclassical Critic knows what a noble contempt of order the Roman Poet\r\nstudiously displays in the review of his countrymen. From Romulus he\r\njumps at once to Augustus; gets back how he can to Numa; goes straight\r\nforward to Brutus; takes a short run to Camillus; makes a long stride\r\nto Julius Cæsar and Pompey; from Cato retreats again to the Gracchi\r\nand the Scipios; and at last arrives in a beautiful zig-zag at\r\nMarcellus, with whom he concludes. And this must be right, because it\r\nis in Virgil.\r\n\r\nA similar confusion, therefore, has now been judiciously introduced by\r\nour Author in the Sixth Book of the ROLLIAD. He first singles out some\r\nof the great statesmen of the present age; then carries us to church,\r\nto hear Dr. Prettyman preach before the Speaker and the pews; and next\r\nshows us all that Mr. DUNDAS means to let the public know of the new\r\nIndia Board;--that is to say, the Members of whom it is composed. He\r\nnow proceeds, where a dull genius would probably have begun, with an\r\naccurate description of the House of Commons, preparatory to the\r\nexhibition of Mr. ROLLE, and some other of our political heroes, on\r\nthat theatre of their glory. Maps of the country round Troy have been\r\ndrawn from the Iliad; and we doubt not, that a plan of St. Stephen's\r\nmight now be delineated with the utmost accuracy from the ROLLIAD.\r\n\r\nMerlin first ushers Duke ROLLO into the LOBBY: marks the situation of\r\nthe two entrances; one in the front, the other communicating laterally\r\nwith the Court of Requests; and points out the topography of the\r\nfire-place and the box,\r\n\r\n         ------ ------ ------in which\r\n  Sits PEARSON, like a pagod in his niche;\r\n  The Gomgom PEARSON, whose sonorous lungs\r\n  With \"Silence! Room there!\" drown an hundred tongues.\r\n\r\nThis passage is in the very spirit of prophecy, which delights to\r\nrepresent things in the most lively manner. We not only see, but hear\r\nPearson in the execution of his office. The language, too, is truly\r\nprophetic; unintelligible, perhaps, to those to whom it is addressed,\r\nbut perfectly clear, full, and forcible to those who live in the time\r\nof the accomplishment. Duke ROLLO might reasonably be supposed to\r\nstare at the barbarous words \"_Pagod_\" and \"_Gomgom_;\" but we, who\r\nknow one to signify an Indian Idol, and the other an Indian Instrument\r\nof music, perceive at once the peculiar propriety with which such\r\nimages are applied to an officer of a House of Commons so completely\r\nIndian as the present. A writer of less judgment would have contented\r\nhimself with comparing Pearson simply to a\r\n\r\n  Statue in his niche--\r\n\r\nand with calling him a Stentor, perhaps in the next line: but such\r\nunappropriated similies and metaphors could not satisfy the nice taste\r\nof our author.\r\n\r\nThe description of the Lobby also furnishes an opportunity of\r\ninterspersing a passage of the tender kind, in praise of the Pomona\r\nwho attends there with oranges. Our poet calls her HUCSTERIA, and, by\r\na dexterous stroke of art, compares her to Shiptonia, whose amours\r\nwith ROLLO form the third and fourth books of the ROLLIAD.\r\n\r\n  Behold the lovely wanton, kind and fair,\r\n  As bright SHIPTONIA, late thy amorous care!\r\n  Mark how her winning smiles, and 'witching eyes,\r\n  On yonder unfledg'd orator she tries!\r\n  Mark, with what grace she offers to his hand\r\n  The tempting orange, pride of China's land!\r\n\r\nThis gives rise to a panegyric on the medical virtues of oranges, and\r\nan oblique censure on the indecent practice of our young Senators, who\r\ncome down drunk from the eating-room, to sleep in the gallery.\r\n\r\n  O! take, wise youth, the' Hesperian fruit, of use\r\n  Thy lungs to cherish with balsamic juice.\r\n  With this thy parch'd roof moisten; nor consume\r\n  Thy hours and guineas in the eating-room,\r\n  Till, full of claret, down with wild uproar\r\n  You reel, and, stretch'd along the gallery, snore.\r\n\r\nFrom this the poet naturally slides into a general caution against the\r\nvice of drunkenness, which he more particularly enforces, by the\r\ninstance of Mr. PITT's late peril, from the farmer at Wandsworth.\r\n\r\n  Ah! think, what danger on debauch attends:\r\n  Let Pitt, once drunk, preach temp'rance to his friends;\r\n  How, as he wander'd darkling o'er the plain,\r\n  His reason drown'd in JENKINSON's champaigne,\r\n  A rustic's hand, but righteous fate withstood,\r\n  Had shed a Premier's for a robber's blood.\r\n\r\nWe have been thus minute in tracing the transitions in this inimitable\r\npassage, as they display, in a superior degree, the wonderful skill of\r\nour poet, who could thus bring together an orange-girl, and the\r\npresent pure and immaculate Minister; a connection, which, it is more\r\nthan probable, few of our readers would in any wise have suspected.\r\n\r\n  --------------Ex fumo dare lucem\r\n  Cogitat, ut speciosa dehinc miracula promat.\r\n\r\nFrom the Lobby we are next led into the several committee-rooms and\r\nother offices adjoining; and among the rest, MERLIN, like a noble\r\nLord, whose diary was some time since printed, \"takes occasion to\r\ninspect the water-closets,\"\r\n\r\n  Where offerings, worthy of those altars, lie,\r\n  Speech, letter, narrative, remark, reply;\r\n  With dead-born taxes, innocent of ill,\r\n  With cancell'd clauses of the India bill:\r\n  There pious NORTHCOTE's meek rebukes, and here\r\n  The labour'd nothings of the SCRUTINEER;\r\n  And reams on reams of tracts, that, without pain,\r\n  Incessant spring from SCOTT's prolific brain.\r\n  Yet wherefore to this age should names be known,\r\n  But heard, and then forgotten in their own?\r\n  Turn then, my son, &c. &c.\r\n\r\nThis passage will probably surprise many of our readers, who must have\r\ndiscovered our author to be, as every good and wise man must be,\r\nfirmly attached to the present system. It was natural for Dante to\r\nsend his enemies to hell; but it seems strange that our poet should\r\nplace the writings of his own friends and fellow-labourers in a\r\nwater-closet. It has indeed been hinted to us, that it might arise from\r\nenvy, to find some of them better rewarded for their exertions in the\r\ncause, than himself. But though great minds have sometimes been\r\nsubject to this passion, we cannot suppose it to have influenced the\r\nauthor of the ROLLIAD in the present instance. For in that case we\r\ndoubt not he would have shown more tenderness to his fellow-sufferer,\r\nthe unfortunate Mr. NORTHCOTE, who, after sacrificing his time,\r\ndegrading his profession, and hazarding his ears twice or thrice every\r\nweek, for these two or three years past, has at length confessed his\r\npatriotism weary of employing his talents for the good of his country,\r\nwithout receiving the reward of his labours. To confess the truth, we\r\nourselves think the apparent singularity of the poet's conduct on this\r\noccasion, may be readily ascribed to that independence of superior\r\ngenius, which we noticed in our last number. We there remarked, with\r\nwhat becoming freedom he spoke to the Minister himself; and in the\r\npassage now before us, we may find traces of the same spirit, in the\r\nallusions to the coal-tax, gauze-tax, and ribbon-tax, as well as the\r\nunexampled alterations and corrections of the celebrated India-bill.\r\nWhy then should it appear extraordinary, that he should take the same\r\nliberty with two or three brother-authors, which he had before taken\r\nwith their master; and without scruple intimate, what he and every one\r\nelse must think of their productions, notwithstanding he may possess\r\nall possible charity for the good intention of their endeavours?\r\n\r\nWe cannot dismiss these criticisms, without observing on the\r\nconcluding lines; how happily our author, here again, as before, by\r\nthe mention of Shiptonia, contrives to recal our attention to the\r\npersonages more immediately before us, MERLIN and DUKE ROLLO!\r\n\r\n                    *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n_NUMBER VII._\r\n\r\nWe come now to the _Sanctum Sanctorum_, the Holy of Holies, where the\r\nglory of political integrity shines visibly, since the shrine has been\r\npurified from Lord J. CAVENDISH, Mr. FOLJAMBE, Sir C. BUNBURY, Mr.\r\nCOKE, Mr. BAKER, Major HARTLEY, and the rest of its pollutions. To\r\ndrop our metaphor, after making a minute survey of the Lobby, peeping\r\ninto the Eating-room, and inspecting the Water-closets, we are at\r\nlength admitted into the House itself. The transition here is\r\npeculiarly grand and solemn. MERLIN, having corrected himself for\r\nwasting so much time on insignificant objects,\r\n\r\n  (Yet wherefore to this age should names be known,\r\n  But heard, and then forgotten in their own?)\r\n\r\nimmediately directs the attention of Rollo to the doors of the house,\r\nwhich are represented in the vision, as opening at that moment to\r\ngratify the hero's curiosity; then the prophet suddenly cries out, in\r\nthe language of ancient Religion,\r\n\r\n  ------Procul, ô procul este profani!\r\n\r\n  Turn then, my son, where to thy hallow'd eye\r\n  Yon doors unfold--Let none profane he nigh!\r\n\r\nIt seems as if the poet, in the preceding descriptions, had purposely\r\nstooped to amuse himself with the Gomgom Pearson, Hucsteria, Major\r\nScott, Mr. Northcote, and the Reverend author of the Scrutineer, that\r\nhe might rise again with the more striking dignity on this great\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nMERLIN now leads ROLLO to the centre of the House,\r\n\r\n  Conventus trahit in medios, turbamque sonantem.\r\n\r\nHe points out to him the gallery for strangers to sit in, and members\r\nto sleep in; the bar below, and the clock above. Of the clock he\r\nobserves,\r\n\r\n  When this shalt point, the hour of question come,\r\n  Mutes shall find voice, and Orators be dumb.\r\n  This, if in lengthen'd parle the night they pass,\r\n  Shall furnish still his opening to DUNDAS;\r\n  To PITT, when \"hear-hims\" flag, shall oft supply\r\n  The chear-trap trick of stale apology;\r\n  And, strange to tell! in Nature's spite, provoke\r\n  Hot ARDEN once to blunder at a joke.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of these lines will be instantly perceived by all who have\r\nwitnessed the debates; as they cannot but have remarked, how\r\nperpetually \"_the late hour of night_\" occupies the exordiums of Mr.\r\nDUNDAS, after eleven o'clock; and how frequently it is introduced by\r\nMr. PITT as a hint, for what is called _chearing_, whenever his\r\narguments and invectives are received by his young friends with the\r\nunparliamentary compliment of sacred silence. The miracle of a jest\r\nfrom Mr. ARDEN, happened on the occasion of some Resolutions having\r\npassed between the hours of _six_ and _seven_ in the morning; for\r\nwhich reason the Attorney-General facetiously contended, that they\r\nwere entitled to no respect, \"as the house was then at _sixes_ and\r\n_sevens_.\" Any approximation to wit in debate, being perfectly unusual\r\nwith this gentleman, however entertaining his friends may think him in\r\nprivate, our author very properly distinguishes this memorable attempt\r\nby the same kind of admiration, with which poets commonly mention some\r\ngreat prodigy--as for instance, of a cow's speaking:\r\n\r\n      ----pecudesque locutæ\r\n  Infandum!\r\n\r\nWe hope none of our readers will attribute to us the most distant\r\nintention of any invidious comparison.\r\n\r\nThe table, mace, &c. are next described, but these we shall pass over\r\nin silence, that we may get--where most who enter the House of Commons\r\nwish to get--to the TREASURY-BENCH,\r\n\r\n  Where sit the gowned clerks, by ancient rule,\r\n  This on a chair, and that upon a stool;\r\n  Where stands the well-pil'd table, cloth'd in green;\r\n  There on the left the TREASURY-BENCH is seen.\r\n  No sattin covering decks the' unsightly boards;\r\n  No velvet cushion holds the youthful lords:\r\n  And claim illustrious Tails such small regard?\r\n  Ah! Tails too tender for a seat so hard.\r\n\r\nThis passage touches on a subject of much offence to the young friends\r\nof the minister; we mean the barbarous and Gothic appearance of the\r\nbenches in the House of Commons. The Treasury-bench itself looks no\r\nbetter than a first form in one of our public schools:\r\n\r\n  No sattin covering decks the' unsightly boards,\r\n  No velvet cushion holds the youthful Lords.\r\n\r\nThe above couplet states with much elegance the matter of complaint,\r\nand glances with equal dexterity at the proper remedy. The composition\r\nis then judiciously varied. The whole art of the poet is employed to\r\ninterest our passions in favour of the necessary reform, by\r\nexpostulatory interrogations and interjections the most affectingly\r\npathetic. And who can read the former, without feeling his sense of\r\nnational honour most deeply injured by the supposed indignity; or who\r\ncan read the latter, without melting into the most unfeigned\r\ncommiseration for the actual sufferings to which the youthful lords\r\nare at present exposed? It must, doubtless, be a seasonable relief to\r\nthe minds of our readers, to be informed, that Mr. PITT (as it has\r\nbeen said in some of the daily papers) means to propose, for one\r\narticle of his Parliamentary Reform, to cover the seats in general\r\nwith crimson sattin, and to decorate the Treasury-bench, in\r\nparticular, with cushions of crimson velvet; one of [1] extraordinary\r\ndimensions being to be appropriated to Mr. W. GRENVILLE.\r\n\r\nThe epithet \"_tender_\" in the last line we were at first disposed to\r\nconsider as merely synonymous with \"_youthful_.\" But a friend, to whom\r\nwe repeated the passage, suspected that the word might bear some more\r\nemphatical sense; and this conjecture indeed seems to be established\r\nbeyond doubt, by the original reading in the manuscript, which, as we\r\nbefore said, has been communicated to us,\r\n\r\n  \"Alas! that flesh, so late by pedants scarr'd,\r\n  Sore from the rod, should suffer seats so hard,\"\r\n\r\nWe give these verses, not as admitting any comparison with the text,\r\nas it now stands, but merely by way of commentary, to illustrate the\r\npoet's meaning.\r\n\r\nFrom the Treasury-bench, we ascend one step to the INDIA-BENCH.\r\n\r\n  \"There too, in place advanc'd, as in command,\r\n  Above the beardless rulers of the land,\r\n  On a bare bench, alas! exalted sit,\r\n  The pillars of Prerogative and PITT;\r\n  Delights of Asia, ornaments of men,\r\n  Thy Sovereign's Sovereigns, happy Hindostan.\"\r\n\r\nThe movement of these lines is, as the subject required, more elevated\r\nthan that of the preceding: yet the prevailing sentiment excited by\r\nthe description of the Treasury-bench, is artfully touched by our\r\nauthor, as he passes, in the Hemistich,\r\n\r\n  On a bare bench, alas!------\r\n\r\nwhich is a beautiful imitation of Virgil's\r\n\r\n  ------Ah! filice in nudâ------\r\n\r\nThe pompous titles so liberally bestowed on the BENGAL SQUAD, as the\r\n_pennyless hirelings_ of opposition affect to call them, are truly in\r\nthe Oriental taste; and we doubt not, but every friend to the present\r\nhappy government, will readily agree in the justice of stiling them\r\n\"pillars of prerogative and Pitt, delights of Asia, and ornaments of\r\nman.\" Neither, we are assured, can any man of any party object to the\r\nlast of their high dignities, \"Sovereigns of the Sovereign of India;\"\r\nsince the Company's well-known sale of Shah Allum to his own Visier,\r\nis an indisputable proof of their supremacy over the Great Mogul.\r\n\r\nAs our author has been formerly accused of plagiarism, we must here in\r\ncandour confess, that he seems, in his description of the India-bench,\r\nto have had an eye to Milton's account of the devil's throne; which,\r\nhowever, we are told, much exceeded the possible splendour of any\r\nIndia-bench, or even the magnificence of Mr. Hastings himself.\r\n\r\n  High on a throne of royal slate, which far\r\n  Outshone the wealth of Orams, or of Ind;\r\n  Or where the gorgeous East, with lavish hand,\r\n  Show'rs on her King, barbaric pearl and gold;\r\n  Satan _exalted sate_.------\r\n\r\nThis concluding phrase, our readers will observe, is exactly and\r\nliterally copied by our author. It is also worthy of remark, that as\r\nhe calls the Bengal squad,\r\n\r\n  The _Pillars_ of Prerogative and Pitt,\r\n\r\nSo Milton calls Beelzebub,\r\n\r\n  A _Pillar_ of State:------\r\n\r\nThough, it is certain, that the expression here quoted may equally\r\nhave been suggested by one of the Persian titles[2], said to be\r\nengraved on a seal of Mr. Hastings, where we find the Governor General\r\nstyled, \"_Pillar_ of the Empire.\" But we shall leave it to our readers\r\nto determine, as they may think proper, on the most probable source of\r\nthe metaphor, whether it were in reality derived from Beelzebub or\r\nMr. Hastings.\r\n\r\n[1] For a description of this young gentleman's person, from _top to\r\nbottom_, see No. V.\r\n\r\n[2] The following is copied from the Morning Chronicle of October 5,\r\n1784.\r\n\r\n  Mr. HASTINGS'S PERSIAN TITLES, _as engraved upon a Seal._\r\n            _A True Translation._\r\n    Nabob Governor-General Hastings, _Saub_,\r\n            Pillar of the Empire,\r\n          The fortunate in War, Hero,\r\n      The most princely offspring of the Loins,\r\n        Of the King of the Universe,\r\n      The Defender of the Mahomedan Faith,\r\n    And Asylum of the World, &c. &c. &c. &c.\r\n\r\n  _Translation of a Persian Inscription engraven on a large fine Ruby,\r\n  being the titles either given to or assumed by Mrs._ HASTINGS.\r\n    \"Royal and Imperial Governess,\r\n    The elegance of the age,\r\n    The most exalted Bilkiss,\r\n    The Zobaide of the Palaces,\r\n    The most heroic Princess,\r\n    Ruby Marian Hastings, Sauby, &c. &c.\r\n\r\nN.B. With the Mussulmans, _Bilkiss_ signifies the person, called in\r\nthe Bible History the Queen of Sheba; and _Zobaide_ was a favourite\r\nwife of Mahomed; and when they wish to pay the highest compliments to\r\na lady, they compare her to Bilkiss and Zobaide, who possessed the\r\nmost exalted beauty, and perfection of every kind.\r\n\r\n                    *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n_NUMBER VIII._\r\n\r\nFrom the above general compliment to the India-bench, the poet, in the\r\nperson of Merlin, breaks out into the following animated apostrophe\r\nto some of the principal among our Leadenhall-street Governors:\r\n\r\n  All hail! ye virtuous patriots without blot, Rollo\r\n  The minor KINSON and the major SCOTT:\r\n  And thou of name uncouth to British ear,\r\n  From Norman smugglers sprung, LE MESURIER;\r\n  Hail SMITHS; and WRAXALL, unabash'd to talk,\r\n  Tho' none will listen; hail too, CALL and PALK;\r\n  Thou, BARWEL, just and good, whose honour'd name,\r\n  Wide, as the Ganges rolls, shall live in fame,\r\n  Second to HASTINGS: and, VANSITTART, thou,\r\n  A second HASTINGS, if the Fates allow.\r\n\r\nThe bold, but truly poetical apocope, by which the Messrs. At-kinson\r\nand Jen-kinson, are called the two kinsons, is already familiar to the\r\npublic. The minor Kinson, or Kinson the less, is obviously Mr.\r\nAtkinson; Mr. Jenkinson being confessedly greater than Mr. Atkinson,\r\nor any other man, except One, in the kingdom.--The antithesis of the\r\nMajor Scott to the minor Kinson, seems to ascertain the sense of the\r\nword Major, as signifying in this place the greater; it might mean\r\nalso the elder; or it might equally refer to the military rank of the\r\ngentleman intended. This is a beautiful example of the figure so much\r\nadmired by the ancients under the name of the Paronomasia, or Pun.\r\nThey who recollect the light in which our author before represented\r\nMajor Scott, as a pamphleteer, fit only to furnish a water-closet, may\r\npossibly wonder to find him here mentioned as THE GREATER SCOTT; but\r\nwhatever may be his literary talents, he must be acknowledged to be\r\ntruly great, and worthy of the conspicuous place here assigned him, if\r\nwe consider him in his capacity of agent to Mr. Hastings, and of\r\nconsequence chief manager of the Bengal Squad; and it must be\r\nremembered, that this is the character in which he is here introduced.\r\nThe circumstance of Mr. Le Mesurier's origin from Norman Smugglers,\r\nhas been erroneously supposed by some critics to be designed for a\r\nreproach; but they could not possibly have fallen into this mistaste,\r\nif they had for a moment reflected that it is addressed by MERLIN to\r\nROLLO, who was himself no more than a Norman pirate. Smuggling and\r\npiracy in heroic times were not only esteemed not infamous, but\r\nabsolutely honourable. The Smiths, Call and Palk of our poet, resemble\r\nthe\r\n\r\n  Alcandrumque, Haliumque, Noëmonaque, Prytanimque,\r\n\r\nof Homer and Virgil; who introduce those gallant warriors for the sake\r\nof a smooth verse, and dispatch them at a stroke without the\r\ndistinction of a single epithet. Our poet too has more professedly\r\nimitated Virgil in the lines respecting Mr. Vansittart, now a\r\ncandidate to succeed Mr. Hastings.\r\n\r\n  ------And, VANSITTART, thou\r\n  A second HASTINGS, if the fates allow.\r\n  ------Si quâ fata aspera rumpas,\r\n  Tu Marcellus eris!\r\n\r\nThe passage however is, as might be hoped from the genius of our\r\nauthor, obviously improved in the imitation; as it involves a climax,\r\nmost happily expressed. Mr. Barwell has been panegyrized in the lines\r\nimmediately foregoing, as _second to Hastings_; but of Mr. Vansittart\r\nit is prophesied, that he will be a _second Hastings_; second indeed\r\nin time, but equal perhaps in the distinguishing merits of that great\r\nand good man, in obedience to the Court of Directors, attention to the\r\ninterests of the Company in preference to his own, abstinence from\r\nrapacity and extortion, justice and policy towards the princes, and\r\nhumanity to all the natives, of Hindostan. The ingenious turn on the\r\nwords _second to Hastings_, and a _second Hastings_, would have\r\nfurnished matter for whole pages to the Dionysius's, Longinus's, and\r\nQuintilians of antiquity, though the affected delicacy of modern taste\r\nmay condemn it as quibble and jingle.\r\n\r\nThe poet then hints at a most ingenious proposal for the embellishment\r\nof the India-bench, according to the new plan of Parliamentary Reform;\r\nnot by fitting it up like the Treasury-bench, with velvet cushions,\r\nbut by erecting for the accommodation of the Leadenhall worthies, the\r\nivory bed, which was lately presented to her Majesty by Mrs. Hastings.\r\n\r\n  O that for you, in Oriental state,\r\n  At ease reclin'd to watch the long debate,\r\n  Beneath the gallery's pillar'd height were spread\r\n  (With the QUEEN's leave) your WARREN's ivory bed!\r\n\r\nThe pannels of the gallery too, over the canopy of the bed, are to be\r\nornamented with suitable paintings,\r\n\r\n  Above, In colours warm with mimic life,\r\n  The German husband of your WARREN's wife\r\n  His rival deeds should blazon; and display.\r\n  In his blest rule, the glories of your sway.\r\n\r\nWhat singular propriety, what striking beauty must the reader of taste\r\nimmediately perceive in this choice of a painter to execute the\r\nauthor's design! It cannot be doubted but Mrs. Hastings would exert\r\nall her own private and all Major Scott's public influence with\r\n_every_ branch of the Legislature, to obtain so illustrious a job for\r\nthe man to whose affection, or to whose want of affection, she owes\r\nher present fortunes. The name of this artist is Imhoff; but though he\r\nwas once honoured with Royal Patronages he is now best remembered from\r\nthe circumstance by which our author has distinguished him, of his\r\nformer relation to Mrs. Hastings.\r\n\r\nThen follow the subjects of the paintings, which are selected with\r\nthe usual judgment of our poet.\r\n\r\n  Here might the tribes of ROHILCUND expire,\r\n  And quench with blood their towns, that sink in fire;\r\n  The Begums there, of pow'r, of wealth forlorn,\r\n  With female cries their hapless fortune mourn.\r\n  Here, hardly rescu'd from his guard, CHEYT SING\r\n  Aghast should fly; there NUNDCOMAR should swing;\r\n  Happy for him! if he had borne to see\r\n  His country beggar'd of the last rupee;\r\n  Nor call'd those laws, O HASTINGS, on thy head,\r\n  Which, mock'd by thee, thy slaves alone should dread.\r\n\r\nThese stories, we presume, are too public to require any explanation.\r\nBut if our readers should wish to be more particularly acquainted with\r\nthem, they will find them in the [1]Adventures of Robinson Crusoe,\r\ncommonly called the Reports of the Select and Secret Committees, with\r\nAppendixes of Letters, Minutes, and Narratives written by Mr. Hastings\r\nhimself. Or they may consult the History of Alexander the Great,\r\ncontained, in Major John Scott's narrative of the administration of\r\nMr. Hastings. Though we would rather refer them to the latter work, as\r\nin our opinion it is one of the most satisfactory defences ever\r\npublished; and proves to demonstration, that Mr. Hastings never\r\ncommitted a single act of injustice or cruelty, but he constantly\r\nobtained forty or fifty lacks for the Company or himself--That an\r\nenquiry into past abuses is an impolitic order; because \"much valuable\r\ntime must be lost, and much odium incurred by the attempt;\" and\r\ntherefore Mr. Hastings of course ought not to have been censured at\r\nall, unless he had been censured _before_ he had done any thing to\r\ndeserve it--That it was right for Mr. Hastings to keep up the good old\r\ncustom of receiving presents, in defiance of a positive law; because\r\nhis predecessors had received as large sums when they were authorized\r\nby custom, and not prohibited by any law--That Mr. Hastings was\r\njustified in disobeying the orders of the Directors, because he could\r\nno otherwise have convinced the Country Powers of his superiority over\r\nhis Masters, which was, and is, absolutely necessary--that, though it\r\nmay be questioned if Nundcomar was legally condemned, it was proper to\r\nexecute him, in order to show the justice and impartiality of the\r\nJudges in hanging the natives, whom they were sent especially to\r\nprotect--That a Treaty of Peace between two nations is of no force, if\r\nyou can get one of the individuals who officially signed it, to\r\nconsent to the infraction of it--together with many other positions,\r\nequally just and novel, both in Ethics and Politics.\r\n\r\nBut to return to our Poet. MERLIN now drops his apostrophe, and\r\neulogizes the India-bench in the third person for the blessings of Tea\r\nand the Commutation Tax. The following passage will show our author to\r\nbe, probably, a much better Grocer than Mr. Pitt; and perhaps little\r\ninferior to the Tea-Purchaser's Guide.\r\n\r\n  What tongue can tell the various kind of Tea?\r\n  Of Blacks and Greens, of Hyson and Bohea;\r\n  With Singlo, Congou, Pekoe, and Souchong:\r\n  Couslip the fragrant, Gun-powder the strong;\r\n  And more, all heathenish alike in name,\r\n  Of humbler some, and some of nobler fame.\r\n\r\nThe prophet then compares the breakfasts of his own times with those\r\nof ours: attributes to the former the intractable spirit of that age;\r\nand from the latter fervently prays, like a loyal subject, for the\r\nperfect accomplishment of their natural effects; that they may relax\r\nthe nerves of Englishmen into a proper state of submission to the\r\nsuperior powers. We shall insert the lines at length.\r\n\r\n  On mighty beef, bedew'd with potent ale,\r\n  Our Saxons, rous'd at early dawn, regale;\r\n  And hence a sturdy, bold, rebellious race,\r\n  Strength in the frame, and spirit in the face,\r\n  All sacred right of Sovereign Power defy,\r\n  For Freedom conquer, or for Freedom die.\r\n  Not so their sons, of manners more polite;\r\n  How would they sicken at the very sight!\r\n  O'er Chocolate's rich froth, o'er Coffee's fume,\r\n  Or Tea's hot tide their noons shall they consume.\r\n  But chief, all sexes, every rank and age,\r\n  Scandal and Tea, more grateful, shall engage;\r\n  In gilded roofs, beside some hedge in none,\r\n  On polish'd tables, or the casual stone.\r\n  Be _Bloom_ reduc'd; and PITT no more a foe,\r\n  Ev'n PITT, the favourite of the fair shall grow:\r\n  Be but _Mundungus_ cheap; on light and air\r\n  New burthens gladly shall our peasants bear,\r\n  And boil their peaceful kettles, gentle souls!\r\n  Contented,--if no tax be laid on coals.\r\n  Aid then, kind Providence, yon' generous bench,\r\n  With copious draughts the thirsty realm to drench;\r\n  And oh! thy equal aid let PRESTON find,\r\n  With [2]_musty-sweet_ and _mouldy-fresh_ combin'd,\r\n  To palsy half our isles: 'till wan, and weak,\r\n  Each nerve unstrung, and bloodless every cheek,\r\n  Head answering head, and noddling thro' the street.\r\n  The destin'd change of Britons is complete;\r\n  Things without will, like India's feeble brood,\r\n  Or China's shaking Mandarins of wood.\r\n  So may the Crown in native lustre shine,\r\n  And British Kings re-sume their right divine.\r\n\r\nWe have been thus prolix in giving the whole of this quotation, as we\r\nthink it glances very finely at the true policy, why it is expedient\r\nto encourage the universal consumption of an article, which some\r\nfactious people have called a pernicious luxury. And our readers, we\r\nare persuaded, will agree with us, when we decidedly pronounce this as\r\ngood a defence of the Commutation Tax, as we have yet seen.\r\n\r\nWe must observe however that our author is probably indebted to the\r\nextensive information of Lord Sydney, for the hint of the following\r\ncouplet:\r\n\r\n  In gilded roofs, beside some hedge in none,\r\n  On polish'd tables, or the casual stone.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State in the discussion of the abovementioned tax,\r\nvery ably calculated the great quantity of tea consumed under hedges\r\nby vagrants, who have no houses; from which he most ingeniously argued\r\nto the justice and equity of laying the impost on persons who\r\nhave houses, whether they consume it or not.\r\n\r\nWe shall conclude this number, as the Poet concludes the subject,\r\nwith some animated verses on Mr. FOX and Mr. PITT.\r\n\r\n  Crown the froth'd Porter, slay the fatted Ox,\r\n  And give the British meal to British Fox.\r\n  But for an Indian minister more fit,\r\n  Ten cups of purest Padrae pour for PITT,\r\n  Pure as himself; add sugar too and cream,\r\n  Sweet as his temper, bland as flows the stream\r\n  Of his smooth eloquence; then crisply nice\r\n  The muffin toast, or bread and butter slice,\r\n  Thin as his arguments, that mock the mind,\r\n  Gone, ere you taste,--no relish left behind.\r\n  Where beauteous Brighton overlooks the sea,\r\n  These be his joys: and STEELE shall make the Tea.\r\n\r\nHow neat! how delicate! and how unexpected is the allusion in the\r\nlast couplet! These two lines alone include the substance of\r\nwhole columns, in the ministerial papers of last summer, on the sober,\r\nthe chaste, the virtuous, the edifying manner in which the\r\nImmaculate Young Man passed the recess from public business;\r\nnot in riot and debauchery, not in gaming, not in attendance on\r\nladies, either modest or immodest, but in drinking Tea with Mr.\r\nSteele, at the Castle in Brighthelmstone. Let future ages read and\r\nadmire!\r\n\r\n[1] We have the highest law authority for this title; as well as for\r\ncalling Mr. Hastings Alexander the Great.\r\n\r\n[2] The Tea-dealers assure us, that Mr. PRESTON's _sweet_ and _fresh_\r\nTeas contain a great part of the _musty_ and _mouldy_ chests, which\r\nthe Trade rejected.\r\n\r\n                    *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n_NUMBER IX._\r\n\r\nIn every new edition of this incomparable poem, it has been the\r\ninvariable practice of the author, to take an opportunity of adverting\r\nto such recent circumstances, as have occurred since the original\r\npublication of it relative to any of the illustrious characters he has\r\ncelebrated. The public has lately been assured that, the Marquis of\r\nGraham is elected Chancellor of the University of Glasgow, and has\r\npresented that learned body with a complete set of the engravings of\r\nPiranesi, an eminent Italian artist; of which we are happy to acquaint\r\nthe Dilettanti, a few remaining sets are to be purchased at\r\nMr. Alderman Boydell's printshop, in Cheapside, price twelve pounds\r\ntwelve shillings each. An anecdote reflecting so much honour upon one\r\nof the favourite characters of our author, could not pass unnoticed in\r\nthe ROLLIAD; and accordingly, in his last edition, we find the\r\nfollowing complimentary lines upon the subject:\r\n\r\n  If right the Bard, whose numbers sweetly flow,\r\n  That all our knowledge is ourselves to know;\r\n  A sage like GRAHAM, can the world produce,\r\n  Who in full senate call'd himself a goose?\r\n  The admiring Commons, from the high-born youth,\r\n  With wonder heard this undisputed truth;\r\n  Exulting Glasgow claim'd him for her own,\r\n  And plac'd the prodigy on Learning's throne.\r\n\r\nHe then alludes to the magnificent present abovementioned, and\r\nconcludes in that happy vein of alliterative excellence, for which he\r\nis so justly admired--\r\n\r\n  With gorgeous gifts from gen'rous GRAHAM grac'd,\r\n  Great Glasgow grows the granary of taste.\r\n\r\nOur readers will doubtless recollect, that this is not the first\r\ntribute of applause paid to the distinguished merit of the\r\npublic-spirited young Nobleman in question. In the first edition of the\r\npoem, his character was drawn at length, the many services he has\r\nrendered his country were enumerated, and we have lately been assured by\r\nour worthy friend and correspondent, Mr. Malcolm M'Gregor, the ingenious\r\nauthor of the Heroic Epistle to Sir William Chambers, and other\r\nvaluable poems, that the following spirited verses, recording the\r\never-memorable circumstance of his Lordship's having procured for the\r\ninhabitants of the Northern extremity of our Island, the inestimable\r\nprivilege of exempting their posteriors from those ignominious symbols\r\nof slavery, vulgarly denominated breeches, are actually universally\r\nrepeated with enthusiasm, throughout every part of the highlands\r\nof Scotland--\r\n\r\n  Thee, GRAHAM! thee, the frozen Chieftains bless,\r\n  Who feel thy bounties through their fav'rite dress;\r\n  By thee they view their rescued country clad\r\n  In the bleak honours of their long-lost plaid;\r\n  Thy patriot zeal has bar'd their parts behind\r\n  To the keen whistlings of the wintry wind;\r\n  While Lairds the dirk, while lasses bag-pipes prize,\r\n  And oat-meal cake the want of bread supplies;\r\n  The scurvy skin, while scaly scabs enrich,\r\n  While contact gives, and brimstone cures the itch,\r\n  Each breeze that blows upon those brawny parts,\r\n  Shall wake thy lov'd remembrance in their hearts;\r\n  And while they freshen from the Northern blast,\r\n  So long thy honour, name, and praise shall last.\r\n\r\nWe need not call to the recollection of the classical reader,\r\n\r\n  Dum juga montis aper, sluvios dum piscis amabit,\r\n  Semper honos, nomenque tuum laudesque manebunt.\r\n\r\nAnd the reader of taste will not hesitate to pronounce, that the copy\r\nhas much improved upon, and very far surpassed the original. In these\r\nlines we also find the most striking instances of the beauties of\r\nalliteration; and however some fastidious critics have affected to\r\nundervalue this excellence, it is no small triumph to those of a\r\ncontrary sentiment to find, that next to our own incomparable author,\r\nthe most exalted genius of the present age, has not disdained to\r\nborrow the assistance of this ornament, in many passages of the\r\nbeautiful dramatic treasure with which he has recently enriched the\r\nstage. Is it necessary for us to add, that it is the new tragedy of\r\nthe Carmelite to which we allude?--A tragedy the beauties of which, we\r\nwill venture confidently to assert, will be admired and felt, when\r\nthose of Shakespeare, Dryden, Otway, Southerne, and Rowe, shall be no\r\nlonger held in estimation. As examples of alliterative beauty, we\r\nshall select the following:--\r\n\r\n  The hand of heav'n hangs o'er me and my house,\r\n  To their untimely graves seven sons swept off.\r\n\r\nAgain--\r\n\r\n  So much for tears--tho' twenty years they flow,\r\n  They wear no channels in a widow's cheek.\r\n\r\nThe alternate alliteration of the second line, in this instance,\r\nseems an improvement upon the art, to the whole merit of which\r\nMr. Cumberland is himself unquestionably entitled.\r\n\r\nAfterwards we read,\r\n\r\n  ------Treasures hoarded up,\r\n  With carking care, and a long life of thrift.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the alliterative merit, we cannot here fail to admire\r\nthe judiciously selected epithet of \"_carking_;\" and the two lines\r\nimmediately following, although no example of that merit, should not\r\nbe omitted:\r\n\r\n  Now, without interest, or redemption swallow'd,\r\n  By the devouring bankrupt waves for ever.\r\n\r\nHow striking is the comparison of the ocean, to a bankrupt swallowing\r\nwithout interest or redemption, the property of his unfortunate\r\ncreditors! Where shall we find a simile of equal beauty, unless some\r\nmay possibly judge the following to be so, which is to be found in\r\nanother part of the same sublime work, of two persons weeping--\r\n\r\n                    ------We will sit\r\n  Like fountain statues, face to face oppos'd,\r\n  And each to other tell our griefs in tears,\r\n  Yet neither utter word------\r\n\r\nOur readers, we trust, will pardon our having been diverted from the\r\ntask we have undertaken, by the satisfaction of dwelling on a few of\r\nthe many beauties of this justly popular and universally admired\r\ntragedy, which, in our humble opinion, infinitely surpasses every\r\nother theatrical composition, being in truth an assemblage of every\r\npossible dramatic excellence: nor do we believe, that any production,\r\nwhether of antient or modern date, can exhibit a more uncommon and\r\npeculiar selection of language, a greater variety of surprising\r\nincidents, a more rapid succession of extraordinary discoveries, a\r\nmore curious collection of descriptions, similies, metaphors, images,\r\nstorms, shipwrecks, challenges, and visions, or a more miscellaneous\r\nand striking picture of the contending passions of love; hatred,\r\npiety, madness, rage, jealousy, remorse, and hunger, than this\r\nunparalleled performance presents to the admiration of the enraptured\r\nspectator. Mr. Cumberland has been represented, perhaps unjustly, as\r\nparticularly jealous of the fame of his cotemporaries, but we are\r\npersuaded he will not be offended when, in the ranks of modern\r\nwriters, we place him second only to the inimitable author of the\r\nROLLIAD.\r\n\r\nTo return from the digression into which a subject so seducing has\r\ninvoluntarily betrayed us. The reader will recollect, that in our last\r\nwe left MERLIN gratifying the curiosity of ROLLO, with a view of that\r\nAssembly of which his Descendant is one day destined to become so\r\nconspicuous an ornament. After having given the due preference to the\r\nIndia-Bench, he proceeds to point out to him others of the most\r\ndistinguished supporters of the present virtuous administration.\r\nHaving already mentioned the most confidential friends of the\r\nminister, he now introduces us to the acquaintance of an active young\r\nMember, who has upon all occasions been pointedly severe upon the\r\nnoble Lord in the blue ribbon, and who is remarkable for never having\r\ndelivered his sentiments upon any subject, whether relating to the\r\nEast-Indies, the Reform of Parliament, or the Westminster Election,\r\nwithout a copious dissertation upon the principles, causes, and\r\nconduct of the American war.\r\n\r\n  Lo! BEAYFOY rises, friend to soft repose;\r\n  Whose gentle accents prompt the house to dose:\r\n  His cadence just, a general sleep provokes,\r\n  Almost as quickly as SIR RICHARD's jokes.\r\n  Thy slumbers, NORTH, he strives in vain to break,\r\n  When all are sleeping, thou would'st scarce awake;\r\n  Though from his lips severe invectives fell,\r\n  Sharp as the acid he delights to sell.\r\n\r\nIn explanation of the last line, it may be, perhaps, necessary to\r\napprise our readers, that this accomplished orator, although the\r\nelegance of his diction, and smoothness of his manner, partake rather\r\nof the properties of oil, is in his commercial capacity, a dealer in\r\nvinegar. The speaker alluded to, under the name of Sir Richard, is\r\nprobably the same whom our author, upon the former occasion, stiled--\r\n\r\n  Sleep-giving poet of a sleepless night.\r\n\r\nThe limits of our plan will not allow us to enlarge upon the various\r\nbeauties with which this part of the work abounds; we cannot, however,\r\nomit the pathetic description of the SPEAKER's situation, nor the\r\nadmirable comparison of Lord MAHON preying on his patience, to the\r\nvulture devouring the liver of Prometheus. The necessity of the\r\nSpeaker's continuing in the chair while the House sits, naturally\r\nreminds our author of his favourite Virgil:\r\n\r\n  ------sedet æternumque sedebit\r\n  Infelix Theseus.\r\n\r\n  There CORNEWELL sits, and, oh unhappy fate!\r\n  Must sit for ever through the long debate;\r\n  Save, when compell'd by Nature's sovereign will,\r\n  Sometimes to empty, and sometimes to fill.\r\n  Painful pre-eminence! he hears, 'tis true,\r\n  FOX, NORTH, and BURKE, but hears SIR JOSEPH too.\r\n\r\nThen follows the simile--\r\n\r\n  Like sad PROMETHEUS, fasten'd to his rock,\r\n  In vain he looks for pity to the clock;\r\n  In vain the' effects of strengthening porter tries,\r\n  And nods to BELLAMY for fresh supplies;\r\n  While vulture-like, the dire MAHON appears,\r\n  And, far more savage, rends his suff'ring ears.\r\n\r\n                    *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n_NUMBER X._\r\n\r\nAmongst the various pretensions to critical approbation, which are to\r\nbe found in the excellent and never-sufficiently to be admired\r\nproduction, which is the object of these comments, there is one that\r\nwill strike the classical observer as peculiarly prominent and\r\npraise-worthy:--namely, the uncommon ability shown by the author, in the\r\nselection of his heroes. The _personæ_ that are introduced in the\r\ncourse of this poem, are characters that speak for themselves. The\r\nvery mention of their names is a summons to approbation; and the\r\nrelation of their history, if given in detail, would prove nothing\r\nmore than a lengthened panegyric. Who that has heard of the names of a\r\nJenkinson, a Robinson, or a Dundas, has not in the same breath heard\r\nalso what they are? This is the secret of our author's science and\r\nexcellence. It is this that enables him to omit the dull detail of\r\nintroductory explanation, and to fasten upon his business, if one may\r\nuse the expression, slap-dash and at once.\r\n\r\n  Semper ad eventum festinat, et in medias res,\r\n  Non secus ac notas auditorum rapit.                   HOR.\r\n\r\nHomer himself yields, in this respect, to our author; for who would\r\nnot perceive the evident injustice done to the modern bard, if we were\r\nto place the wisdom of an Ulysses on any competition with the\r\nexperience of a Pitt; to mention the bully Ajax, as half so genuine a\r\nbully, as the bully Thurlow; if we were to look upon Nestor as having\r\na quarter of the interesting circumlocution of the ambiguous Nugent;\r\nto consider Achilles as possessed of half the anger of a ROLLE; or to\r\nsuppose for a moment, that the famous {podas-okus} of antiquity, could\r\nrun nearly so fast in a rage, as the member for Devon in a fright; to\r\nconceive the yellow-haired Paris to have had half the beauty of the\r\nten times more yellow-haired Villiers; to look upon Agamemnon as in\r\nany degree so dictatorial to his chiefs as the high-minded Richmond;\r\nto consider the friendship of Patroclus, as possessed of a millionth\r\nportion of the disinterested attachment of a Dundas; to have any\r\nconception that the chosen band of Thessalian Myrmidons, were to be\r\nany way compared, in point of implicit submission, to the still more\r\ndextrously chosen band of the Minister in the British House of\r\nCommons. Or--but there is no end to so invidious a comparison; and we\r\nwill not expose poor Homer, to the farther mortification of pursuing\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMERLIN proceeds in his relation, and fixes upon an object that will\r\nnot, we believe, prove any disgrace to our author's general judgment\r\nof selection; namely, that worthy Baronet and universally admired wit,\r\nSir RICHARD HILL, of whom it may be truly said,\r\n\r\n  ------Pariter pietate jocisque,\r\n  Egregius.\r\n\r\nHe looks upon him as an individual meriting every distinction, and has\r\nthought proper therefore, in the last edition of the ROLLIAD, though\r\nthe Baronet had been [1]slightly touched upon before, to enlarge what\r\nwas then said, into a more particular description. Speaking of Sir\r\nRichard's style of elocution, our author observes--\r\n\r\n  With quaint formality of sacred smut,\r\n  His rev'rend jokes see pious RICHARD cut.\r\n  Let meaner talents from the Bible draw\r\n  Their faith, their morals These, and Those their law!\r\n  His lively genius finds in holy writ\r\n  A richer mine of unsuspected wit.\r\n  What never Jew, what never Christian taught,\r\n  What never fir'd one sectary's heated thought,\r\n  What not e'en [2]ROWLAND dream'd, he saw alone,\r\n  And to the wondering senate first made known;\r\n  How bright o'er mortal jokes the Scriptures shine\r\n  Resplendent Jest-book of bon-mots divine.\r\n\r\nThis description will be readily felt, and we trust, not less\r\ncordially admired, by all those who may have enjoyed the pleasure of\r\nauricular evidence to Sir Richard's oratory. The thought of converting\r\nthe Bible into a _jest book_, is, we believe, quite new; and not more\r\noriginal in itself, than characteristically just in its application to\r\nthe speaker. We all know that Saul affected insanity for the sake of\r\nreligion, in the early periods of our holy faith; and why so great an\r\nexample should not be imitated in later times, we leave it to the\r\nprophane to shew.\r\n\r\nWe know not whether it is worth observing, that the eloquence of this\r\nillustrious family is not confined to Sir Richard alone; but that his\r\nbrother inherits the same gift, and, if possible, in a greater degree.\r\nIt is said, there is an intention of divesting this latter gentleman\r\nof his clerical robe, and bringing him into the senate, as the avowed\r\ncompetitor of our modern Cromwell. If this happy event should luckily\r\ntake place, we shall literally see the observation then realized, that\r\nthe Ministry will give to their wicked enemies, on the other side of\r\nthe House, what they have so long wanted and deserved.\r\n\r\n  \"------A _Rowland_ for their _Oliver_.\"\r\n\r\nThis, however, by the way. Our author resumes his subject with the\r\nfollowing spirited apostrophe:--\r\n\r\n  Methinks I see him from the Bench arise,\r\n  His words all keenness, but all meek his eyes;\r\n  Define the good religion might produce,\r\n  Practise its highest excellence-abuse;\r\n  And with his tongue, that two-edg'd weapon, show,\r\n  At once the double worth of JOB and JOE.\r\n\r\n_Job_, as some of our more learned readers may know, is a book in the\r\nOld Testament, and is used here _per synechdochen_, as a part for the\r\nwhole. Nothing can be more natural, than the preference given to this\r\nbook, on this occasion, as Sir Richard is well known in his speeches\r\nto be so admirable an auxiliary to its precepts. The person of the\r\nname of _Joe_, who has received so laconic a mention in the last line\r\nof the above extract, will be recognized by the critical and the\r\nintelligent, as the same individual who distinguished himself so\r\neminently in the sixteenth century, as a writer and a wit, namely,\r\nMr. Joseph Miller; a great genius, and an author, avowedly in the\r\nhighest estimation with our learned Baronet.\r\n\r\nThe business of the composition goes on.--It is evident, however,\r\nthe poet was extremely averse to quit a subject upon which his\r\ncongenial talents reposed so kindly. He does not leave Sir Richard,\r\ntherefore, without the following finished and most high-wrought\r\ncompliment:\r\n\r\n  With wit so various, piety so odd,\r\n  Quoting by turns from Miller and from God;\r\n  Shall no distinction wait thy honour'd name?\r\n  No lofty epithet transmit thy fame?\r\n  Forbid it wit, from mirth refin'd away!\r\n  Forbid it Scripture, which thou mak'st so gay!\r\n  SCIPIO, we know, was AFRICANUS call'd,\r\n  RICHARD styl'd LONG-SHANKS--CHARLES surnam'd the BALD;\r\n  Shall these for petty merits be renown'd,\r\n  And no proud phrase, with panegyric sound,\r\n  Swell thy short name, great HILL?--Here take thy due,\r\n  And hence be call'd the' SCRIPTURAL KILLIGREW.\r\n\r\nThe administration of baptism to adults, is quite consonant to\r\nSir Richard's creed; and we are perfectly satisfied, there is not a\r\nMember in the House of Commons that will not stand sponsor for him on\r\nthis honourable occasion. Should any one ask him in future,--Who gave\r\nyou that name? Sir Richard may fairly and truly reply, My Godfathers,\r\n&c. and quote the whole of the lower assembly, as coming under that\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nMERLIN, led, as may easily be supposed, by sympathy of rank, talents,\r\nand character, now pointed his wand to another worthy baronet, hardly\r\nless worthy of distinction than the last personage himself, namely,\r\nSir JOSEPH MAWBEY. Of him the author sets out with saying,\r\n\r\n  Let this, ye wise, be ever understood,\r\n  SIR JOSEPH is as witty as he's good.--\r\n\r\nHere, for the first time, the annotators upon this immortal poem, find\r\nthemselves compelled, in critical justice to own, that the author has\r\nnot kept entire pace with the original which he has affected to\r\nimitate. The distich, of which the above is a parody, was composed by\r\nthe worthy hero of this part of the ROLLIAD, the amiable Sir Joseph\r\nhimself, and runs thus:\r\n\r\n  Ye ladies, of your hearts beware:\r\n  SIR JOSEPH's false as he is fair.\r\n\r\nHow kind, and how discreet a caution! This couplet, independent of its\r\nother merits, possesses a recommendation not frequently found in\r\npoetry, the transcendant ornament of Truth. How far, indeed,\r\nthe falshood of this respectable individual has been displayed in his\r\ngallantries, it is not the province of sober criticism to enquire.\r\nWe take up the assertion with a large comprehension, and with a\r\nstricter eye to general character--\r\n\r\n  SIR JOSEPH's false as he is fair.------\r\n\r\nIs it necessary to challenge, what no one will be absurd enough to\r\ngive--a contradiction to so acknowledged a truth? Or is it necessary\r\nto state to the fashionable reader, that whatever may be the degree of\r\nSir Joseph's boasted falshood, it cannot surpass the fairness of\r\nhis complexion? The position, therefore, is what logicians call\r\nconvertible: nothing can equal his falshood but his fairness;\r\nnothing his fairness but his falshood.--Incomparable!\r\n\r\nProceeding to a description of his eloquence, he says,\r\n\r\n  A sty of pigs, though all at once it squeaks,\r\n  Means not so much as MAWBEY when he speaks;\r\n  And his'try says, he never yet had bred\r\n  A pig with such a voice or such a head!\r\n  Except, indeed, when he essays to joke;\r\n  And then his wit is truly pig-in-poke.\r\n\r\nDescribing Sir Joseph's acquisitions as a scholar, the author adds,\r\n\r\n  His various knowledge I will still maintain,\r\n  He is indeed a knowing man in grain.\r\n\r\nSome commentators have invidiously suggested, that the last line of\r\nthis couplet should be printed thus,\r\n\r\n  He is indeed a knowing man-in grain:\r\n\r\nassigning as their reason, that the phrase in grain evidently alludes\r\nto bran, with which Sir Joseph's little grunting commonwealth is\r\nsupported; and for the discreet and prudent purchase of which our\r\nworthy baronet is famous.\r\n\r\nOur author concludes his description of this great senator with\r\nthe following distich:\r\n\r\n  Such adaptation ne'er was seen before,\r\n  His trade a hog is, and his wit--a boar.\r\n\r\nIt has been proposed to us to amend the spelling: of the last word,\r\nthus, _bore_; this improvement, however, as it was called, we reject\r\nas a calumny.\r\n\r\nWhere the beauty of a passage is pre-eminently striking as above, we\r\nwaste not criticism in useless efforts at emendation.\r\n\r\nThe writer goes on. He tells you he cannot quit this history of wits,\r\nwithout saying something of another individual; whom, however, he\r\ndescribes as every way inferior to the two last-mentioned, but who,\r\nnevertheless, possesses some pretensions to a place in the ROLLIAD.\r\nThe individual alluded to, is Mr. GEORGE SELWYN. The author describes\r\nhim as a man possessed of\r\n\r\n  A plenteous magazine of retail wit\r\n  Vamp'd up at leisure for some future hit;\r\n  Cut for suppos'd occasions, like the trade,\r\n  Where old new things for every shape are made!\r\n  To this assortment, well prepar'd at home,\r\n  No human chance unfitted e'er can come;\r\n  No accident, however strange or queer,\r\n  But meets its ready well-kept comment here.\r\n  --The wary beavers thus their stores increase,\r\n  And spend their winter on their summer's grease.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the above description will doubtless remind the classic\r\nreader of the following beautiful passage in the Tusculan Questions of\r\nCicero: _Nescio quomodo inhæret in mentibus quasi sæculorum_ quoddam\r\naugurium futurorum--_idque in_ maximis ingeniis altissimisque animis\r\n_existit maxime et apparet facillime_. This will easily account for\r\nthe system of previous fabrication so well known as the character of\r\nMr. Selwyn's jokes. Speaking of an accident that befel this gentleman\r\nin the _wars_, our author proceeds thus:\r\n\r\n  Of old, when men from fevers made escape,\r\n  They sacrific'd a cock to ÆSCULAPE:\r\n  Thus, Love's hot fever now for ever o'er,\r\n  The prey of amorous malady no more,\r\n  SELWYN remembers what his tutor taught,\r\n  That old examples ever should be sought!\r\n  And, gaily grateful, to his surgeon cries,\r\n  \"I've given to you the Ancient Sacrifice.\"\r\n\r\nThe delicacy with which this historical incident is pourtrayed,\r\nwould of itself have been sufficient to transmit our author's merit\r\nto posterity: and with the above extract we shall finish the present\r\nnumber of our commentaries.\r\n\r\n[1] See No. III.\r\n\r\n[2] The Reverend Rowland Hill, brother of Sir Richard.\r\n\r\n                    *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n_NUMBER XI._\r\n\r\nThe next person among the adherents of the Minister, whom MERLIN now\r\npoints out to the notice of ROLLO, is SIR SAMUEL HANNAY, Baronet,\r\na name recollected with great gratitude in the House: for there are\r\nfew Members in it to whom he has not been serviceable. This worthy\r\ncharacter indeed has done more to disprove Martial's famous assertion,\r\n\r\n  Non cuicunque datum est habere _nasum_,\r\n\r\nthan any individual upon record.\r\n\r\nThe author proceeds--\r\n\r\n  But why, my HANNAY, does the ling'ring Muse\r\n  The tribute of a line to thee refuse?\r\n  Say, what distinction most delights thine ear,\r\n  Or _Philo-Pill_, or _Philo-Minister?_\r\n  Oh! may'st thou none of all thy titles lack,\r\n  Or Scot, or Statesman, Baronet or Quack;\r\n  For what is due to him, whose constant view is\r\n  _Preventing_ private, or a public _lues?_\r\n\r\nWho, that read the above description, do not, during the first\r\nimpression of it, suppose that they see the worthy Baronet once more\r\nthe pride of front advertisements--once more dispensing disregard and\r\noblivion amongst all his competitors; and making your Leakes, your\r\nLockyers, and your Velnos,\r\n\r\n  --Hide their diminish'd heads.--\r\n\r\nIn the passages which immediately follow, the poet goes on to\r\nfelicitate the community upon the probable advantages to be derived to\r\nthem from the junction of this illustrious personage with our\r\nimmaculate Minister. He divides his congratulations into two parts.\r\nHe first considers the consequence of the union, as they may affect\r\nthe body personal; and secondly, as they may concern the body politic.\r\nUpon the former subject, he says,\r\n\r\n  This famous pair, in happy league combin'd,\r\n  No risques shall man from wand'ring beauty find;\r\n  For, should not chaste example save from ill,\r\n  There's still a refuge in the other's pill.\r\n\r\nWith a sketch equally brief and masterly as the above, he describes\r\nhis hopes on the other branch of his division.\r\n\r\n  The body politic no more shall grieve\r\n  The motley stains that dire corruptions leave;\r\n  No dang'rous humours shall infest the state,\r\n  Nor _rotten Members_ hasten Britain's fate.\r\n\r\nOur author who, notwithstanding his usual and characteristic gravity,\r\nhas yet not un-frequently an obvious tendency to the sportive,\r\ncondescends now to take notice of a rumour, which in these times had\r\nbeen universally circulated, that Sir Samuel bad parted with his\r\nspecific, and disposed of it to a gentleman often mentioned, and\r\nalways with infinite and due respect, in the ROLLIAD, namely,\r\nMr. Dundas.--Upon this he addresses Sir Samuel with equal truth and\r\ngood-humour in the following couplet:\r\n\r\n  Then shall thy med'cine boast its native bent,\r\n  Then spread its genuine blessing--_to prevent_.\r\n\r\nOur readers cannot but know, it was by the means of a nostrum,\r\nemphatically called a _Specific_, that Mr. Dundas so long contrived to\r\nprevent the constitutional lues of a _Parliamentary Reform_. The\r\nauthor, however, does not profess, to give implicit credit to the fact\r\nof Sir Samuel's having ungratefully disposed of his favourite recipe,\r\nthe happy source of his livelihood and fame; the more so, as it\r\nappears that Mr. Dundas had found the very word _specific_ sufficient\r\nfor protracting a dreadful political evil on the three several\r\ninstances of its application. Under this impression of the thing,\r\nthe poet strongly recommends Sir Samuel to go on in the prosecution\r\nof his original profession, and thus expresses his wish upon\r\nthe occasion, with the correct transcript of which we shall close\r\nthe history of this great man:\r\n\r\n  In those snug corners be thy skill display'd,\r\n  Where Nature's tribute modestly is paid:\r\n  Or near fam'd Temple-bar may some good dame,        }\r\n  Herself past sport, but yet a friend to game,       }\r\n  Disperse thy bills, and eternize thy fame.          }\r\n\r\nMERLIN now calls the attention of our hero to a man whom there is\r\nlittle doubt this country will long remember, and still less, that\r\nthey will have abundant reason for so doing, namely, Mr. SECRETARY\r\nORDE. It may seem odd by what latent association our author was led to\r\nappeal next to the Right Honourable Secretary, immediately after the\r\ndescription of a Quack Doctor; but let it be recollected in the first\r\nplace, to the honour of Sir Samuel Hannay, that he is, perhaps,\r\nthe only man of his order that ever had a place in the British House\r\nof Commons; and in the second, that there are some leading\r\ncircumstances in the character of Mr. Orde, which will intitle him to\r\nrank under the very same description as the worthy Baronet himself.\r\nWe all know that the most famous of all physicians, _Le Medecin malgré\r\nlui_, is represented by Moliere, as a mart who changes the seat of the\r\nheart, and reverses the intire position of the vital parts of the\r\nhuman body. Now let it be asked, has not Mr. Orde done this most\r\ncompletely and effectually with respect to the general body of the\r\nstate? Has he not transferred the heart of the empire? Has he not\r\nchanged its circulation, and altered the situation of the vital part\r\nof the whole, from the left to the right, from the one side to the\r\nother, from Great Britain to Ireland?--Surely no one will deny this;\r\nand therefore none will be now ignorant of the natural gradation of\r\nthought, by which our author was led, from the contemplation of Sir\r\nSamuel Hannay, to the character of Mr. Orde.\r\n\r\nWe know not whether it be worth remarking, that the term _Le Medecin\r\nmalgré lui_, has been translated into English with the usual\r\nincivility of that people to every thing foreign, by the uncourtly\r\nphrase of _Mock Doctor_. We trust, however, that no one will think it\r\napplicable in this interpretation to Mr. Orde, as it is pretty evident\r\nhe has displayed no mockery in his State Practices, but has performed\r\nthe character of Moliere's _Medecin_, even beyond the notion of the\r\noriginal; by having effected in sad and sober truth, to the full as\r\ncomplete a change in the position of the _Coeur de l'Empire_, as the\r\nlively fancy of the dramatist had imputed to his physician, with\r\nrespect to the human body, in mere speculative joke.\r\n\r\nWith a great many apologies for so long a note, we proceed now to the\r\nmuch more pleasant part of our duty--that of transcribing from this\r\nexcellent composition; and proceed to the description of Mr. Orde's\r\nperson, which the poet commences thus:\r\n\r\n  Tall and erect, unmeaning, mute, and pale,\r\n  O'er his blank face no gleams of thought prevail;\r\n  Wan as the man in classic story fam'd,\r\n  Who told old PRIAM that his Ilion flam'd;\r\n  Yet soon the time will come when speak he hall,\r\n  And at his voice another Ilion fall!\r\n\r\nThe excellence of this description consists as that of a portrait\r\nalways must, in a most scrupulous and inveterate attention to\r\nlikeness.--Those who know the original, will not question the accuracy\r\nof resemblance on this occasion. The idea conveyed in the last line,\r\n\r\n  And at his voice another Ilion fall,\r\n\r\nis a spirited imitation of the _fuimus Troes, fuit Ilium_, of Virgil,\r\nand a most statesmanlike anticipation of the future fate of England.\r\n\r\nThe author now takes an opportunity of shewing the profundity of his\r\nlearning in British history. He goes on to say,\r\n\r\n  CÆSAR, we know, with anxious effort try'd\r\n  To swell, with Britain's name, his triumph's pride:\r\n  Oft he essay'd, but still essay'd in vain;\r\n  Great in herself, she mock'd the menac'd chain.\r\n  But fruitless all--for what was CÆSAR's sword\r\n  To thy all-conquering speeches, mighty ORDE!!!\r\n\r\nOur author cannot so far resist his classical propensity in this\r\nplace, as to refrain from the following allusion; which, however, must\r\nbe confessed at least, to be applied with justice.\r\n\r\n  AMPHION's lyre, they say, could raise a town;\r\n  ORDE's elocution pulls a Nation down.\r\n\r\nHe proceeds with equal spirit and erudition to another circumstance\r\nin the earlier periods of English history,\r\n\r\n  The lab'ring bosom of the teeming North\r\n  Long pour'd, in vain, her valiant offspring forth;\r\n  For GOTH or VANDAL, once on British shore,\r\n  Relax'd his nerve, and conquer'd states no more.\r\n  Not so the VANDAL of the modern time,\r\n  This latter offspring of the Northern clime;\r\n  He, with a breath, gives Britain's wealth away,\r\n  And smiles, triumphant, o'er her setting ray.\r\n\r\nIt will be necessary to observe here, that after much enquiry and very\r\nlaborious search, as to the birth-place of the Right Honourable\r\nSecretary (for the honour of which, however difficult now to discover,\r\nHibernia's cities will, doubtless, hereafter contend) we found that he\r\nwas born in NORTHUMBERLAND; which, added to other circumstances,\r\nclearly establishes the applicability of the description of the word\r\n_Goth_, &c. and particularly in the lines where he calls him the\r\n\r\n  ------VANDAL of the modern time,\r\n  The latter offspring of the Northern clime.\r\n\r\nHaving investigated, with an acumen and minuteness seldom incident to\r\ngenius, and very rarely met with in the sublimer poetry, all the\r\ncircumstances attending an event which he emphatically describes as\r\nthe _Revolution_ of seventeen hundred and eighty-five, he makes the\r\nfollowing address to the English:\r\n\r\n  No more, ye English, high in classic pride,\r\n  The phrase uncouth of Ireland's sons deride;\r\n  For say, ye wise, which most performs the fool,\r\n  Or he who _speaks_, or he who _acts_--a BULL.\r\n\r\nThe Poet catches fire as he runs:\r\n\r\n        --Poetica surgit\r\n        Tempestas.\r\n\r\nHe approximates now to the magnificent, or perhaps more properly to\r\nthe _mania_ of Poetry, and like another Cassandra, begins to try his\r\nskill at prophecy; like her he predicts truly, and like her, for the\r\npresent at least, is not, perhaps, very implicitly credited.--He\r\nproceeds thus;\r\n\r\n  Rapt into future times, the Muse surveys\r\n  The rip'ning; wonders of succeeding days:\r\n  Sees Albion prostrate, all her splendour gone!\r\n  In useless tears her pristine state bemoan;\r\n  Sees the fair sources of her pow'r and pride\r\n  In purer channels roll their golden tide;\r\n  Sees her at once of wealth and honour shorn,\r\n  No more the nations' envy, but their scorn;\r\n  A sad example of capricious fate,\r\n  Portentous warning to the proud and great:\r\n  Sees Commerce quit her desolated isle,\r\n  And seek in other climes a kinder soil;\r\n  Sees fair Ierne rise from England's flame,\r\n  And build on British ruin, Irish fame.\r\n\r\nThe Poet in the above passage, is supposed to have had an eye to\r\nJuno's address to Æolus in the first book of the Æneid:\r\n\r\n  Gens inimica mihi Tyrrhenum navigat æquor\r\n  _Ilium_ in _Italiam_ portans, _Victos_ que _Penates_.\r\n\r\n                    *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n_NUMBER XII._\r\n\r\nThough we have at length nearly exhausted the beauties of that part\r\nof our author's work, in which the characters of the leading Members\r\nof the House of Commons are so poetically and forcibly delineated;\r\nwe shall find, however, that the genius of the poet seems to receive\r\nfresh vigour, as he approaches the period of his exertions, in the\r\nillustrious Mr. ROLLE. What can be more sublime or picturesque than\r\nthe following description!\r\n\r\n  Erect in person, see yon Knight advance,\r\n  With trusty 'Squire, who bears his shield and lance;\r\n  The Quixote HOWARD! Royal Windsor's pride,\r\n  And Sancho Panca POWNEY by his side;\r\n  A monarch's champion, with indignant frown,\r\n  And haughty mein, he casts his gauntlet down;\r\n  Majestic sits, and hears, devoid of dread,\r\n  The dire Phillippicks whizzing round his head.\r\n  Your venom'd shafts, ye sons of Faction spare;\r\n  However keen, they cannot enter there.\r\n\r\nAnd how well do these lines, immediately succeeding, describe\r\nthe manner of speaking, which characterizes an orator of such\r\nconsiderable weight and authority:\r\n\r\n  He speaks, he speaks! Sedition's chiefs around,\r\n  With unfeign'd terror hear the solemn sound;\r\n  While little POWNEY chears with livelier note,\r\n  And shares his triumph in a silent vote.\r\n\r\nSome have ignorantly objected to this as an instance of that figure\r\nfor which a neighbouring kingdom is so generally celebrated, vulgarly\r\ndistinguished by the appellation of a _Bull_; erroneously conceiving a\r\nsilent vote to be incompatible with the vociferation here alluded to:\r\nthose, however, who have attended parliamentary debates, will inform\r\nthem, that numbers who most loudly exert themselves, in what is called\r\n_chearing_ speakers, are not upon that account entitled to be\r\nthemselves considered as such.--Our author has indeed done injustice\r\nto the worthy member in question, by classing him among the number of\r\nmutes, he having uniformly taken a very active part in all debates\r\nrelating to the militia; of which truly constitutional body, he is a\r\nmost respectable Pillar, and one of the most conspicuous ornaments.\r\n\r\nIt is unquestionably the highest praise we can bestow upon a member of\r\nthe British House of Commons, to say, that he is a faithful\r\nrepresentative of the people, and upon all occasions speaks the real\r\nsentiments of his constituents; nor can an honest ambition to attain\r\nthe first dignities of the state, by honourable means, be ever imputed\r\nto him as a crime. The following encomium, therefore, must be\r\nacknowledged to have been justly merited by a noble Lord, whose\r\nindependent and disinterested conduct has drawn upon him the censures\r\nof disappointed faction.\r\n\r\n  The Noble CONVERT, Berwick's honour'd choice,\r\n  That faithful echo of the people's voice,\r\n  One day, to gain an Irish title glad,\r\n  For Fox he voted--so the people bad;\r\n  'Mongst English Lords ambitious grown to sit,\r\n  Next day the people bade him vote for PITT:\r\n  To join the stream our Patriot, nothing loth,\r\n  By turns discreetly gave his voice to both.\r\n\r\nThe title of Noble convert, which was bestowed upon his Lordship by a\r\nSpeaker of the degraded Whig faction, is here most judiciously adopted\r\nby our Author, implying thereby that this denomination, intended,\r\nno doubt, to convey a severe reproach, ought rather to be considered\r\nas a subject of panegyric: this is turning the artillery of the enemy\r\nagainst themselves--\r\n\r\n  \"Neque lex est justior ulla, &c.\"\r\n\r\nIn the next character introduced, some persons may perhaps object to\r\nthe seeming impropriety of alluding to a bodily defect; especially one\r\nwhich has been the consequence of a most cruel accident; but when it\r\nis considered, that the mention of the personal imperfection is made\r\nthe vehicle of an elegant compliment to the superior qualifications of\r\nthe mind, this objection, though founded in liberality, will naturally\r\nfall to the ground.\r\n\r\nThe circumstance of one of the Representatives of the first city in\r\nthe world having lost his leg, while bathing in the sea, by the bite\r\nof a shark, is well known; nor can the dexterity with which he avails\r\nhimself of the use of an artificial one, have escaped the observation\r\nof those who have seen him in the House of Commons, any more than the\r\nremarkable humility with which he is accustomed to introduce his very\r\npointed and important observations upon the matters in deliberation\r\nbefore that august assembly.\r\n\r\n  \"One moment's time might I presume to beg?\"\r\n  Cries modest WATSON, on his wooden leg;\r\n  That leg, in which such wond'rous art is shown,\r\n  It almost seems to serve him like his own;\r\n  Oh! had the monster, who for breakfast eat\r\n  That luckless limb, his nobler noddle met,\r\n  The best of workmen, nor the best of wood,\r\n  Had scarce supply'd him with a head so good.\r\n\r\nTo have asserted that neither the utmost extent of human skill, nor\r\nthe greatest perfection in the materials, could have been equal to an\r\nundertaking so arduous, would have been a species of adulation so\r\nfulsome, as to have shocked the known modesty of the worthy\r\nmagistrate; but the forcible manner in which the difficulty of\r\nsupplying so capital a loss is expressed, conveys, with the utmost\r\ndelicacy, a handsome, and, it must be confessed, a most justly merited\r\ncompliment to the Alderman's abilities.\r\n\r\nThe imitation of celebrated writers is recommended by Longinus,\r\nand has, as our readers must have frequently observed, been practised\r\nwith great success, by our author; yet we cannot help thinking that\r\nhe has pushed the precept of this great critic somewhat too far,\r\nin having condescended to copy, may we venture to say with so much\r\nservility, a genius so much inferior to himself as Mr. Pope. We allude\r\nto the following lines:\r\n\r\n  Can I, NEWHAVEN, FERGUSON forget,\r\n  While Roman spirit charms, or Scottish wit?\r\n  MACDONALD, shining a refulgent star,\r\n  To light alike the senate and the bar;\r\n  And HARLEY, constant to support the throne,\r\n  Great follower of its interests and his own.\r\n\r\nThe substitution of _Scottish_ for _Attic_, in the second line, is\r\nunquestionably an improvement, since however Attic wit may have been\r\nproverbial in ancient times, the natives of Scotland are so\r\nconfessedly distinguished among modern nations for this quality, that\r\nthe alteration certainly adds considerable force to the compliment.\r\nBut however happily and justly the characters are here described,\r\nwe cannot think this merit sufficient to counterbalance the objection\r\nwe have presumed to suggest, and which is principally founded upon the\r\nextreme veneration and high respect we entertain for the genius\r\nof our author.\r\n\r\nMr. Addison has observed, that Virgil falls infinitely short of Homer\r\nin the characters of his Epic Poem, both as to their variety and\r\nnovelty, but he could not with justice have said the same of the\r\nauthor of the ROLLIAD; and we will venture to assert, that the single\r\nbook of this Poem, now under our consideration, is, in this respect,\r\nsuperior to the whole, both of the Iliad and the Æneid together.\r\nThe characters succeed each other with a rapidity that scarcely allows\r\nthe reader time to admire and feel their several beauties.\r\n\r\n  GALWAY and GIDEON, in themselves a host,\r\n  Of York and Coventry the splendid boast:\r\n  WHITBREAD and ONGLEY, pride of Bedford's vale,\r\n  This fam'd for selling, that for saving ale;\r\n  And NANCY POULETT, as the morning fair,\r\n  Bright as the sun, but common as the air;\r\n  Inconstant nymph! who still with open arms,\r\n  To ev'ry Minister devotes her charms.\r\n\r\nBut when the Poet comes to describe the character of the hero of his\r\nwork, the present Member for the county of Devon, whom MERLIN points\r\nout to his illustrious ancestor, as uniting in himself all the Various\r\nmerits of the worthies whose excellencies he has recorded, he seems to\r\nrise even above himself.--It is impossible to do justice to his\r\ncharacter, without transcribing the whole, which would exceed the\r\nlimits of our work; we shall therefore only give to our readers the\r\nconcluding lines, because they contain characteristic observations\r\nupon other distinguished Members, most of whom have hitherto passed\r\nunnoticed:\r\n\r\n  In thee, my son, shall ev'ry virtue meet,\r\n  To form both senator and man complete:\r\n  A mind like WRAY's, with stores of fancy fraught,\r\n  The wise Sir WATKIN's vast extent of thought;\r\n  Old NUGENT's style, sublime, yet ne'er obscure,\r\n  With BAMBER's Grammar, as his conscience pure;\r\n  BRETT's brilliant sallies, MARTIN's sterling sense,\r\n  And GILBERT's wit, that never gave offence:\r\n  Like WILKES, a zealot in his Sovereign's cause,\r\n  Learn'd as MACDONALD in his country's laws;\r\n  Acute as AUDREY, as Sir LLOYD polite,\r\n  As EASTWICKE lively, and as AMBLER bright.\r\n\r\nThe justice of [1] the compliment to SIR CECIL WRAY, will not be\r\ndisputed by those who have been fortunate enough to have met with the\r\nbeautiful specimens of juvenile poetry, with which some of his friends\r\nhave lately indulged the public.\r\n\r\nJohannes Scriblerus, a lineal descendant of the learned and celebrated\r\nMartinus, reads \"Starling Martin's sense,\" alluding to that powerful\r\nopponent of the detestable Coalition having recommended that a bird of\r\nthat species should be placed on the right of the Speaker's chair,\r\nafter having been taught to repeat the word Coalition, in order to\r\nremind the House of that disgraceful event, which had nearly\r\nestablished an efficient and strong government in this country: to\r\nwhich severe and admirable stroke of satire, the object of it clumsily\r\nand uncivilly answered, that whilst that gentleman sat in the House,\r\nhe believed the Starling might be allowed to perform his office by\r\ndeputy. We have, however, ventured to differ from this great authority,\r\nand shall continue to read, \"Martin's Sterling sense,\" as well\r\nbecause we are of opinion that these words are peculiarly applicable\r\nto the gentleman alluded to, as that it does not appear probable our\r\nauthor should have been willing to make his poem the vehicle of an\r\nindecent sarcasm, upon a person of such eminent abilities.\r\n\r\nThe compliment to Mr. B.G. in the comparison of the purity of his\r\nlanguage to the integrity of his conduct, is happily conceived;\r\nbut that to the ingenious Mr. Gilbert, the worthy Chairman of the\r\nCommittee of Supply, is above all praise, and will, we are persuaded,\r\nnotwithstanding the violence of party, by all sides be admitted to be\r\nstrictly just.\r\n\r\n[1] The characteristic of _Fancy_, which our Poet has attributed to\r\nSir Cecil, must not be misunderstood. It is a Fancy of the chastized\r\nkind; distinguished for that elegant simplicity, which the French call\r\n_naïveté_, and the Greeks {apheleia}. We shall insert here two or\r\nthree of the shorter specimens.\r\n\r\n  _To_ CÆLIA _(now Lady_ Wray) _on seeing her the 8th of August, 1776,\r\n  powdering her hair_\r\n\r\n    EXTEMPORE.\r\n\r\n    Thy locks, I trow, fair maid,\r\n    Don't never want this aid:\r\n    Wherefore thy powder spare,\r\n    And only _comb_ thy hair.\r\n\r\n  _To_ SIR JOSEPH MAWBEY, _proposing, in consequence of a previous\r\n  Engagement, a Party to go a-fishing for White-Bait._\r\n\r\n    Worthy SIR JOE, we all are wishing\r\n    You'll come with us a-White-Bait-fishing.\r\n\r\n  _A Thought on_ NEW MILK _some Time toward the Spring of the Year\r\n  1773._\r\n\r\n    Oh! how charming is New Milk!\r\n    Sweet as sugar!--smooth as silk!\r\n\r\n  _An_ IDEA _on a_ PECK _of_ COALS.\r\n\r\n    I buy my Coals by peck, that we\r\n    May have 'em _fresh_ and _fresh_, d'ye see.\r\n\r\n                    *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n_NUMBER XIII._\r\n\r\nAfter concluding the review of the Ministerialists with the young\r\nMarcellus of the Poem, the illustrious Mr. ROLLE; our author directs\r\nthe attention of DUKE ROLLO to the Opposition-bench. He notices the\r\ncautious silence of MERLIN relative to that side of the House, and\r\nrather inquisitively asks the reason; on which the Philosopher\r\n(a little unphilosophically, we must confess) throws himself into a\r\nviolent passion, and for a long time is wholly incapable of\r\narticulating a syllable. This is a common situation in poets both\r\nancient and modern, as in Virgil and Milton;\r\n\r\n  Ter conata loqui, &c.\r\n  Thrice he essay'd, and thrice in spight of scorn\r\n  Tears, such as angels weep, burst forth, &c.\r\n\r\nbut we will venture to assert, that it was never painted in a manner\r\nhalf so lively, as by the author of the ROLLIAD.\r\n\r\n  Thrice he essay'd, but thrice in vain essay'd;\r\n  His tongue, throat, teeth, and lips, refus'd their aid:\r\n  Till now the stifled breath a passage broke;\r\n  He gasp'd, he gap'd--but not a word he spoke.\r\n\r\nHow accurately, and learnedly, has the poet enumerated all the organs\r\nof speech, which separately and jointly refuse to execute their\r\nrespective offices! How superior is this to the simply cleaving of the\r\ntongue to the palate, the _Vox faucibus hæsit_ of Virgil. For as\r\nQuintilian observes, a detail of particulars is infinitely better than\r\nany general expression, however strong. Then the poor Prophet obtains\r\na little remission of his paroxysm; he begins to breathe\r\nconvulsively--_he gasped_; he opens his mouth to its utmost\r\nextent--_he gaped_; our expectations are raised, and, alas! he still\r\ncontinues unable to utter--_not a word he spoke_. Surely nothing can\r\nbe more natural in point of truth, than all the circumstances of this\r\ninimitable description: nothing more artful in point of effect, than\r\nthe suspence and attention which it begets in the mind of the reader!\r\n\r\nAt length, however, MERLIN recovers his voice; and breaks out into a\r\nstrain of most animated invective, infinitely superior to every thing\r\nof the kind in Homer; though the old Grecian must be acknowledged not\r\nto want spirit in the altercations, or scolding matches, of his heroes\r\nand Gods. The Prophet begins, as a man in any great emotion always\r\nmust, at the middle of a verse;\r\n\r\n  ------ ------ ------Tatterdemalions,\r\n  Scald miserables, Rascals and Rascalions,\r\n  Buffoons, Dependants, Parasites, Toad-eaters,\r\n  Knaves, Sharpers, Black-legs, Palmers, Coggers, Cheaters,\r\n  Scrubs, Vagrants, Beggars, Mumpers, Ragamuffins,\r\n  Rogues, Villains, Bravos, Desperados, Ruffians,\r\n  Thieves, Robbers, Cut-throats, &c. &c. &c.\r\n\r\nAnd in this manner he proceeds, with single appellatives of reproach,\r\nfor ten or twelve lines further; when, his virtuous indignation a\r\nlittle subsiding, or his Dictionary failing, he becomes more\r\ncircumlocutory; as for instance,\r\n\r\n  Burglarious Scoundrels, that again would steal\r\n  The PREMIER's Plate, and CHANCELLOR's Great Seal;\r\n  Of public Murderers, Patrons and Allies,\r\n  Hirelings of France, their country's enemies, &c.\r\n\r\nwhich style he continues for more than twenty lines.\r\n\r\nWe are truly sorry, that the boundaries of our plan would not allow us\r\nto present our readers with the whole of this finished passage in\r\ndetail; as it furnishes an indisputable proof, that, however the Greek\r\nlanguage may have been celebrated for its copiousness, it must yield\r\nin that respect to the English. For if we were to collect all the\r\nterms of infamy bandied about[1], from Æschines to Demosthenes, and\r\nfrom Demosthenes back again to Æschines; and if to these we should\r\nadd in Latin the whole torrent of calumny poured by Cicero on Antony\r\nand Piso; though the ancient orators were tolerably fluent in this\r\nkind of eloquence, they would, all together, be found to fall very\r\nshort of our poet, shackled as he is with rhyme, in the force no less\r\nthan the variety of his objurgatory epithets. At the same time it must\r\nnot be concealed, that he possessed one very considerable advantage in\r\nthe rich repositories of our ministerial newspapers. He has culled the\r\nflowers, skimmed the cream, and extracted the very quintessence of\r\nthose elegant productions with equal industry and success. Indeed,\r\nsuch of our readers as are conversant with the Morning Post and Public\r\nAdvertiser, the White-Hall, the St. James's, and, in short, the\r\ngreater part of the evening prints, will immediately discover the\r\npassage now before us to be little more than a cento. It is however\r\nsuch a cento as indicates the man of genius, whom puny scribblers may\r\nin vain endeavour to imitate in the NEW ROLLIADS.\r\n\r\nIt is possible, MERLIN might even have gone on much longer: but he is\r\ninterrupted by one of those disturbances which frequently prevail in\r\nthe House of Commons. The confusion is finely described in the\r\nfollowing broken couplet:\r\n\r\n  Spoke! Spoke!--Sir--Mr. Speaker--Order there!\r\n  I rise--spoke! Question! Question!--Chair! Chair! Chair!\r\n\r\nThis incident is highly natural, and introduced with the greatest\r\njudgment, as it gives another opportunity of exhibiting Mr. ROLLE, and\r\nin a situation, where he always appears with conspicuous pre-eminence.\r\n\r\n  Great ROLLO look'd, amaz'd; nor without fears,\r\n  His hands applied by instinct to his ears:\r\n  He look'd, and lo! amid the wild acclaim\r\n  Discern'd the future glory of his name;\r\n  O'er this new Babel of the noisy croud,\r\n  More fierce than all, more turbulent, more loud.\r\n  Him yet he heard, with thund'ring voice contend,\r\n  \"Him first, him last, him midst, him without end.\"\r\n\r\nThis concluding line our author has condescended to borrow from\r\nMilton; but how apposite and forcible is the application! How\r\nemphatically does it express the noble perseverance with which the\r\nMember for Devonshire has been known to persist on these occasions,\r\nin opposition to the Speaker himself.\r\n\r\nROLLO, however, is at length wearied, as the greatest admirers\r\nof Mr. ROLLE have sometimes been, with the triumphs of his\r\nillustrious descendant.\r\n\r\n  But ROLLO, as he clos'd his ears before,\r\n  Now tired, averts his eyes to see no more.\r\n  Observant MERLIN, while he turn'd his head,\r\n  The lantern shifted, and the vision fled.\r\n\r\nTo understand this last line, our reader must recollect, that though\r\nthe characters introduced in this vision are preternaturally endowed\r\nwith seeming powers of speech, yet the forms or shadows of them are\r\nshewn by means of a magic lantern.\r\n\r\nHaving now concluded our observations upon this part of the Poem--we\r\nshall close them with remarking, that as our author evidently borrowed\r\nthe idea of this vision, in which the character of future times are\r\ndescribed, from Virgil, he has far surpassed his original; and as his\r\ndescription of the present House of Commons, may not improbably have\r\ncalled to his mind the Pandæmonium of Milton, we do not scruple to\r\nassert, that in the execution of his design, that great master of the\r\nsublime has fallen infinitely short of him.\r\n\r\n[1] More particularly in their two famous orations, which, are\r\nentitled \"_On the Crown._\"\r\n\r\n                    *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n_NUMBER XIV._\r\n\r\nOur readers may possibly think, that verses enough have been already\r\ndevoted to the celebration of Mr. ROLLE; the Poet, however, is not of\r\nthe same opinion. To crown the whole, he now proceeds to commemorate\r\nthe column which is shortly to be erected on the spot, where the\r\nMember for Devonshire formerly went to School, application having been\r\nmade to Parliament for leave to remove the school from its present\r\nsituation; and a motion being intended to follow, for appropriating a\r\nsum of money to mark the scene and record the fact of Mr. ROLLE's\r\neducation, for the satisfaction of posterity, who might otherwise have\r\nbeen left in a state of uncertainty, whether this great man had any\r\neducation at all.\r\n\r\nMERLIN first shews ROLLO the school. The transition to this object\r\nfrom the present House of Commons is easy and obvious. Indeed, the\r\nstriking similarity between the two visions is observed by ROLLO in\r\nthe following passage:\r\n\r\n  The Hero sees, thick-swarming round the place,\r\n  In bloom of early youth, a busy race;\r\n  _Propria quæ maribus_, with barbarous sound,\r\n  _Syntax_ and _prosody_ his ear confound,\r\n  \"And say (he cries), Interpreter of fate,\r\n  Oh! say, is this some jargon of debate?\r\n  What means the din, and what the scene? proclaim;\r\n  Is this another vision, or the same?\r\n  For trust me, Prophet, to my ears, my eyes,\r\n  A second House of Commons seems to rise.\"\r\n\r\nMERLIN however rectifies the mistake of the good Duke: and points out\r\nto him his great descendant, in the shape of a lubberly boy, as\r\nremarkably mute on this occasion, as we lately found him in the House,\r\n\r\n  More fierce than all, more turbulent, more loud.\r\n\r\nThe flaggellation of Mr. ROLLE succeeds, which, as MERLIN informs\r\nROLLO, is his daily discipline. The sight of the rod, which the\r\nPædagogue flourishes with a degree of savage triumph over the exposed,\r\nand bleeding youth, awakens all the feelings of the ancestor:\r\n\r\n  Stay, monster, stay! he cries in hasty mood,\r\n  Throw that dire weapon down--behold my blood!\r\n\r\nWe quote this couplet the rather, because it proves our author to be\r\nas good a Critic as a Poet. For the last line is undoubtedly a new\r\nreading of Virgil's,\r\n\r\n  Projice tela manu,--Sanguis meus!\r\n\r\nAnd how much more spirited is this interpretation,\r\n\r\n  ------ ------ ------Behold my blood!\r\n\r\nthan the commonly received construction of the Latin words, by which\r\nthey are made to signify simply, \"O my son!\" and that too with the\r\nassistance of a poetical licence. There is not a better emendation in\r\nall the Virgilius Restauratus of the learned Martinus Scriblerus.\r\n\r\nOn the exclamation of ROLLO, which we have just quoted, the Prophet,\r\nperceiving that he has moved his illustrious visitor a little too far,\r\nadministers every consolation,\r\n\r\n  \"Thy care dismiss (the Seer replied, and smil'd)\r\n  Tho' rods awhile may weal the sacred child,\r\n  In vain ten thousand [1]BUSBIES should employ\r\n  Their pedant arts his genius to destroy;\r\n  In vain at either end thy ROLLE assail,\r\n  To learning proof alike at head and tail.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly this assurance has its proper effect in calming the mind\r\nof the Duke.\r\n\r\nBut the great topic of comfort, or we should rather say of exultation,\r\nto him, is the prophecy of the column, with which MERLIN concludes his\r\nspeech:\r\n\r\n  Where now he suffers, on this hallow'd land,\r\n  A Column, public Monument, shall stand:\r\n  And many a bard around the sculptur'd base,\r\n  In many a language his renown shall trace;\r\n  In French, Italian, Latin, and in Greek;\r\n  That all, whose curious search this spot shall seek,\r\n  May read, and reading tell at home, return'd,\r\n  How much great ROLLE was flogg'd, how little learn'd.\r\n\r\nWhat a noble, and what a just character of the great ROLLE is\r\ncontained in the last line! A mind tinctured with modern prejudices\r\nmay be at a loss to discover the compliment. But our author is a man\r\nof erudition and draws his ideas from ancient learning, even where he\r\nemploys that learning, like [2]Erasmus and the admirable Creichton,\r\nin praise of ignorance. Our classical readers, therefore, will see in\r\nthis portrait of Mr. ROLLE, the living resemblance of the ancient\r\nSpartans; a people the pride of Greece, and admiration of the world,\r\nwho are peculiarly distinguished in history for their systematic\r\ncontempt of the fine arts, and the patience with which they taught\r\ntheir children to bear floggings.\r\n\r\nThe School now vanishes, and the Column rises, properly adorned with\r\nthe inscriptions, which the philosopher explains. But as we have been\r\nfavoured with correct copies of the inscriptions themselves, which\r\nwere selected from a much greater number composed by our universities,\r\nwe shall here desert our Poet, and present the public with the\r\noriginals.\r\n\r\nThe two first are in Greek; and agreeably to the usual style of Greek\r\ninscriptions, relate the plain fact in short and simple, but elegant\r\nand forcible, phraseology.\r\n\r\n  {Ode to Rhetorikes deinon stoma thauma te Bules,\r\n  Prota DEBONIZEIN apemanthane pais pote ROLLOS.}\r\n\r\nThe word {Debonizein} is not to be found in our Lexicons; but we\r\npresume, that it means, \"to speak the dialect of Devonshire;\" from\r\n{Debonia}, which is Greek for Devonshire. Accordingly, we have so\r\nrendered it in a translation, which we have attempted for the benefit\r\nof the country gentlemen and the ladies.\r\n\r\n  The senate's wonder, ROLLE [3]of mighty tongue,\r\n  Here first his Devonshire unlearn'd when young.\r\n\r\nHow simple, yet how full, is the expression of this distich!\r\nHow perfectly does it agree with the notion, which our poet has\r\ninculcated, of Mr. ROLLE! He was employed at school not to learn but\r\nto unlearn; his whole progress, was, like a crab's, backward.\r\n\r\nThere is a beauty in the Greek which it is impossible to preserve in\r\nEnglish; the word which we have translated \"_unlearned_,\" is in the\r\nimperfect tense: and, in the nicety of that accurate language implies,\r\nthat the action was begun, but not completed; that Mr. ROLLE made some\r\nproficiency in unlearning his Devonshire; but had not effectually\r\naccomplished it during his stay at the school.\r\n\r\nThe other Greek inscription has something more ingenious, from a\r\nseeming paradox in the turn of it:\r\n\r\n  {Outus o mepote pou ti mathon pros metinos, ode\r\n  Pais pote ROLLIADES, ossaper oid, emathen.}\r\n\r\n  He, who to learning nothing owes,\r\n  Here ROLLE, a boy, learn'd all he knows.\r\n\r\nBy which concluding word \"_knows_,\" we must certainly understand\r\nacquired knowledge only; since Mr. ROLLE has been celebrated by our\r\nPoet in the most unequivocal manner, as may be seen in the twelfth\r\nnumber of our Criticisms, for his great natural faculties. The sense\r\nof this last Epigram will then be merely, that the Member for\r\nDevonshire had no particle of acquired knowledge; but is an\r\n{autodidaktos}, a self-taught scholar, a character so much admired in\r\nancient times. The Latin inscription is as follows:\r\n\r\n  Hic ferulæ, dextram, hîc, virgis cædenda magistri,\r\n    Nuda dedit patiens tergora ROLLIADES.\r\n  At non ROLLIADEN domuerunt verbera; non, quæ\r\n    Nescio quid gravius præmonuere, minæ,\r\n  Ah! quoties illum æqualis mirata corona est\r\n    Nec lacrymam in pænis rumpere, nec gemitum!\r\n  Ah! quoties, cum supplicio jam incumberet, ipsi\r\n    [4]Orbillo cecidit victa labore manus!\r\n  I, puer; I, forti tolerando pectore plagas,\r\n    Æmula ROLLIADÆ nomina disce sequi.\r\n\r\n  Here to the ferule ROLLE his hand resign'd,\r\n  Here to the rod he bar'd the parts behind;\r\n  But him no stripes subdu'd, and him no fear\r\n  Of menac'd wrath in future more severe.\r\n  How oft the youthful circle wond'ring saw\r\n  That pain from him nor tear, nor groan could draw!\r\n  How oft, when still unmoved, he long'd to jerk,\r\n  The master's wearied hand forsook the work!\r\n  Go, boy; and scorning rods, or ferules, aim\r\n  By equal worth to rival ROLLE in fame.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of these lines, we presume, is too obvious to require any\r\ncomment. We will confidently affirm, that they record as glorious an\r\nexample of patience as any to be found in all the History of the\r\nFlagellants, though the ingenious M. De Lolme has extended the subject\r\ninto a handsome Quarto.\r\n\r\nThe Italian inscription is a kind of short dialogue, in which the\r\ntraveller is introduced, demanding the name of the person to whom\r\nthe pillar is erected.\r\n\r\n  A chi si sta questa colonna? Al ROLLE;\r\n  Che di parlar apprese in questo loco\r\n  Greco e Latino nò, ma Inglese--un poco.\r\n  Basta così. Chi non sa il resto, è folle.\r\n\r\nThis abrupt conclusion we think very fine. It has however been\r\ncensured as equivocal. Some critics have urged, that the same turn\r\nhas, in fact, been applied equally to men greatly famous and greatly\r\ninfamous; to Johannes Mirandula, and Colonel Chartres: and in the\r\npresent case, say these cavillers, it may be construed to signify\r\neither that the rest is too well known to require repetition, or that\r\nthere is nothing more to be known. But the great character of\r\nMr. ROLLE will at once remove all ambiguity.\r\n\r\nThe French inscription was furnished by Mr. ROLLE himself on the day\r\nof his election. The idea was first expressed by him in English,\r\nand then done into French verse by the [5] Dutch dancing master\r\nat Exeter, to whom Mr. ROLLE is indebted for his extraordinary\r\nproficiency in that science.\r\n\r\n  Ne pouvoir point parler à mon chien je reproche;\r\n  Moi, j'acquis en ces lieux le don de la parole:\r\n  Je vais donc, & bien vite, à Londres par le coche,\r\n  Faire entendre au Senat, que je suis un vrai ROLLE.\r\n\r\nThe _par le coche_ seems to be an addition of the Dancing-master,\r\nwho was certainly no very great Poet, as appears by his use of\r\nfeminine rhymes only, without any mixture of masculine: an\r\nirregularity perfectly inadmissible, as all our polite readers must\r\nknow, in the nicety of French prosody. We shall subjoin for the\r\nentertainment of our readers an inscription in the parish school at\r\nRouen, which was written about a century since on the original Rollo.\r\n\r\n    Ici ROLLON fessé soir & matin,\r\n    Beaucoup souffrit, point n'apprit se Latin.\r\n  Aux fiers combats bien mieux joua son rôle:\r\n  Tuer des gens lui parut chose drôle.\r\n    Femme epousa, plus douce que satin,\r\n    Et, par bonheur, déjà veuve & catin;\r\n  D'elle reçut un fils & la v------le.\r\n  Ainsi, Lecteur, naquit le premier ROLLE!\r\n\r\nBut to return to our author. After the vision of the column, MERLIN\r\nproceeds in a short speech to intimate to ROLLO, that higher honours\r\nmay yet await his descendant in the House of Lords,\r\n\r\n  Where ROLLE may be, what ROLLO was before.\r\n\r\nThis, as may be naturally supposed, excites the curiosity of the Duke;\r\nbut MERLIN declares, that it is not permitted him to reveal the\r\nglories of the Upper house. The hero must first fulfil his fates,\r\nby mortally wounding the Saxon drummer, whom Providence shall inspire\r\nin his last moments for this particular purpose.\r\n\r\n  Ere yet thou know, what higher honours wait\r\n  Thy future race, accomplish them thy fate.\r\n  When now the bravest of our Saxon train\r\n  Beneath thy conquering arms shall press the plain;\r\n  What yet remains, his voice divine in death\r\n  Shall tell, and Heav'n for this shall lengthen out his breath.\r\n\r\nWhich last line is most happily lengthened out into an Alexandrine,\r\nto make the sound an echo to the sense. The pause too after the words\r\n\"shall tell,\" finely marks the sudden catches and spasmodic efforts of\r\na dying man. Some extracts from the Drummer's prophecies have already\r\nbeen given to the public; and from these specimens of his loquacity\r\nwith a thurst in quarte through his lungs, our readers will probably\r\nsee the propriety with which the immediate hand of Heaven is here\r\nintroduced. The most rigid critic will not deny that here is truly the\r\n\r\n  Dignus vindice nodus,\r\n\r\nwhich Horace requires to justify the interposition of a Divinity.\r\n\r\nWe are now come to the concluding lines of the sixth book. Our readers\r\nare probably acquainted with the commonly-received superstition\r\nrelative to the exit of Magicians, that they are carried away by\r\nDevils. The poet has made exquisite use of this popular belief, though\r\nhe could not help returning in the last line to his favourite Virgil.\r\nClassical observers will immediately perceive the allusion to\r\n\r\n  ------Revocare gradum, superasque evadere ad auras\r\n  Hic labor, hoc opus est;\r\n\r\nin the description of ROLLO's re-ascent from the night-cellar into\r\nthe open air.\r\n\r\nThe Prophet foreseeing his instant end,\r\n\r\n  \"At once, farewel,\" he said. But, as he said,\r\n  Like mortal bailiffs to the sight array'd,\r\n  Two fiends advancing seiz'd, and bore away\r\n  To their dark dens the much-resisting prey:\r\n  While ROLLO nimbly clamber'd in a fright,\r\n  Tho' steep and difficult the way, to light.\r\n\r\nAnd thus ends the sixth book of the ROLLIAD; which we have chosen for\r\nthe subject of the FIRST PART of our CRITICISMS. In the second part,\r\nwhich is now going on in the Morning-Herald, where the first draughts\r\nof the present numbers were originally published, we shall pursue our\r\nCommentary through the House of Peers; and in a third part, for which\r\nwe are now preparing and arranging materials, it is our intention to\r\npresent our readers with a series of anecdotes from the political\r\nhistory of our ministry, which our author has artfully contrived to\r\ninterweave in his inimitable poem.\r\n\r\nAnd here, while we are closing this first Part, we cannot but\r\ncongratulate ourselves, that we have been the humble instruments of\r\nfirst calling the attention of the learned to this wonderful effort of\r\nmodern genius, the fame of, which has already exceeded the limits of\r\nthis island, and perhaps may not be circumscribed by the present age;\r\nwhich, we have the best reason to believe, will very shortly diffuse\r\nthe glory of our present Rulers in many and distant quarters of the\r\nglobe; and which may not improbably descend to exhibit them in their\r\ntrue colours to remote posterity. That we indeed imagine our\r\nCriticisms to have contributed very much to this great popularity of\r\nthe ROLLIAD, we will not attempt to conceal. And this persuasion shall\r\nanimate us to continue our endeavours with redoubled application, that\r\nwe may complete, as early as possible, the design, which we have some\r\ntime since formed to ourselves, and which we have now submitted to the\r\nPublic; happy, if that which is yet to come, be received with the same\r\ndegree of favour as this, which is now finished, so peculiarly\r\nexperienced even in its most imperfect condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Dr. Busby, formerly master of Westminster school, was famous for\r\nhis consumption of birch. MERLIN uses his name here by the spirit of\r\nprophecy.\r\n\r\n[2] Erasmus wrote an _Encomium of Folly_, with abundant wit and\r\nlearning.\r\nFor Creichton, see the Adventurer.\r\n\r\n[3] The literal English is \"_vehement mouth of oratory._\"\r\n\r\n[4] A great flogger of antiquity,\r\n    ------Memini quæ _plagosum_ mihi parvo\r\n    _Orbilium_ dictare.             HOR.\r\n\r\n[5] Mynheer Hoppingen Van Caperagen, who soon after the publication of\r\nour first authentic Edition, sent the following letter to Mr. Ridgway:\r\n\r\n                           D'Exeter, ce 18 Avril, 1785.\r\n\r\n  \"Je suis fort etonné. Monsieur, que vous ayez eu la hardiesse\r\n  d'admettre dans \"_La Critique de la Rolliade_,\" une accusation\r\n  contre moi qui n'est nullement fondée, et qui tend à me nuire dans\r\n  l'esprit de tous les amateurs des beaux arts. Sachez, Monsieur, que\r\n  je me suis donné la peine de traduire _mot à mot_ la célébré\r\n  inscription, de mon digne élève et protecteur, _Mr. Rolle_; que je\r\n  n'y ai rien ajouté, et que dans le vers où il est question _du\r\n  coche_, votre Critique n'auroit dû voir qu'une preuve de l'économie\r\n  de mon susdit _Mécene_. Quant aux rimes féminines que l'auteur me\r\n  reproche avec tant d'aigreur, je vous dirai qu'il n'y a rien de\r\n  _mâle_ dans l'esprit de Mr. _Rolle_, et que j'aurois blessé sa\r\n  delicatesse en m'y prenant autrement; d'ailleurs je me moque des\r\n  usages, et je ne veux pas que mes vers sautent à clochepied, comme\r\n  ceux des poëtes François, qui n'entendent rien à la danse. Je ne\r\n  doute pas que vous approuviez mon sentiment là-dessus, et que vous\r\n  me fassiez rendre justice sur l'objet de ma plainte: en attendant,\r\n  je vous prie de croire que je suis, avec le plus vif attachment,\r\n      Monsieur, votre très obeissant serviteur,\r\n          HOPPINGEN VAN CAPERAGEN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF PART THE FIRST.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCRITICISMS\r\nON\r\nTHE ROLLIAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART THE SECOND\r\n\r\n                    *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n_NUMBER I._\r\n\r\nWe have now followed our admirable author through the _Sixth Book_ of\r\nhis poem; very much to our own edification, and, we flatter ourselves,\r\nno less to the satisfaction of our readers. We have shewn the art with\r\nwhich he has introduced a description of the leading characters of our\r\npresent House of Commons, by a contrivance something similar indeed to\r\nthat employed by Virgil, but at the same time sufficiently unlike to\r\nsubstantiate his own claim to originality. And surely every candid\r\ncritic will admit, that had he satisfied himself with the same device,\r\nin order to panegyrize his favourites in the other House, he would\r\nhave been perfectly blameless. But to the writer of the ROLLIAD, it\r\nwas not sufficient to escape censure; he must extort our praise, and\r\nexcite our admiration.\r\n\r\nOur classical readers will recollect, that all Epic Heroes possess in\r\ncommon with the poets who celebrate their actions, the gift of\r\n_prophecy_; with this difference however, that poets prophecy while\r\nthey are in sound health, whereas the hero never begins to talk about\r\nfuturity, until he has received such a mortal wound in his lungs as\r\nwould prevent any man but a hero from talking at all: and it is\r\nprobably in allusion to this circumstance, that the power of\r\ndivination is distinguished in North Britain by the name of SECOND\r\nSIGHT, as commencing when common vision ends. This faculty has been\r\nattributed to dying warriors, both by _Homer_ and _Virgil_; but\r\nneither of these poets have made so good use of it as our author, who\r\nhas introduced into the last dying speech of the Saxon Drummer, the\r\nwhole birth, parentage, and education, life, character, and behaviour,\r\nof all those benefactors of their country, who at present adorn the\r\nHouse of Peers, thereby conforming himself to modern usage, and at\r\nthe same time distinguishing the victorious Rollo's prowess in\r\nsubduing an adversary, who dies infinitely harder than either Turnus\r\nor Hector.\r\n\r\nWithout farther comment, we shall now proceed to favour our readers\r\nwith a few extracts. The first Peer mentioned by the _Dying Drummer_,\r\nis the present _Marquis of Buckingham_: his appearance is ushered in\r\nby an elegant panegyric on his father, Mr. _George Grenville_, of\r\nwhich we shall only give the concluding lines:\r\n\r\n  _George_, in whose subtle brain, if Fame say true,\r\n  Full-fraught with wars, the fatal stamp-act grew;\r\n  Great financier! stupenduous calculator!--\r\n  _But, George_ the son is _twenty-one times_ greater!\r\n\r\nIt would require a volume, not only to point out all the merits of the\r\nlast line, but even to do justice to that Pindaric spirit, that abrupt\r\nbeauty, that graceful aberration from rigid grammatical contexts,\r\nwhich appears in the single word _but_. We had however a further\r\nintention in quoting this passage, viz. to assert our author's claim\r\nto the invention of that species of MORAL ARITHMETIC, which, by the\r\nmeans of proper additions, subtractions, multiplications and\r\ndivisions, ascertains the relative merits of two characters more\r\ncorrectly than any other mode of investigation hitherto invented. Lord\r\nThurlow, when he informed the House of Peers, that, \"_one_ Hastings is\r\nworth _twenty_ Macartneys,\" had certainly the merit of ascertaining\r\nthe comparative value of the two men in _whole numbers_, and _without\r\na fraction_. He likewise enabled his auditors, by means of _the rule\r\nof three_, to find out the numerical excellence of any other\r\nindividual; but to compare Lord Thurlow with our author, would be to\r\ncompare the scholar with the inventor; to compare a common\r\nhouse-steward with _Euclid_ or _Archimedes_. We now return to the\r\npoem.\r\n\r\nAfter the lines already quoted, our dying drummer breaks out into the\r\nfollowing wonderful apostrophe:\r\n\r\n  Approach, ye sophs, who, in your northern den,\r\n  Wield, with both hands, your huge _didactic_ pen;\r\n  Who, step by step, o'er _Pindus_' up-hill road,\r\n  Drag slowly on your learning's pond'rous load:\r\n  Though many a shock your perilous march encumbers,\r\n  Ere the stiff prose can struggle into numbers;\r\n  And you, at _comets' tails_, who fondly stare,\r\n  And find a mistress in the _lesser bear_;\r\n  And you, who, full with metaphysics fraught,\r\n  Detect sensation starting into thought,\r\n  And trace each sketch by Memory's hand design'd\r\n  On that strange magic lantern call'd the MIND;\r\n  And you, who watch each loit'ring empire's fate;\r\n  Who heap up fact on fact, and date on date;\r\n  Who count the threads that fill the mystic loom,\r\n  Where patient vengeance wove the fate of Rome;\r\n  Who tell that wealth unnerv'd her soldier's hand,        }\r\n  That Folly urg'd the fate by traitor's plann'd;          }\r\n  Or, that she fell--because she could not stand:          }\r\n  Approach, and view, in this capacious mind,\r\n  Your scatter'd science in one mass combin'd:\r\n  Whate'er tradition tells, or poets sing,\r\n  Of giant-killing John, or John the King;\r\n  Whate'er------\r\n\r\nBut we are apprehensive that our zeal has already hurried us too far,\r\nand that we have exceeded the just bounds of this paper. We shall\r\ntherefore take some future opportunity of reverting to the character\r\nof this prodigious nobleman, who possesses, and deserves to possess,\r\nso distinguished a share in his master's confidence. Suffice it to\r\nsay, that our author does full justice to every part of his character.\r\nHe considers him as a walking warehouse of facts of all kinds, whether\r\nrelating to history, astronomy, metaphysics, heraldry, fortifications,\r\nnaval tactics, or midwifery; at the same time representing him as a\r\nkind of haberdasher of small talents, which he retails to the female\r\npart of his family, instructing them in the mystery of precedence,\r\nthe whole art of scented pomatums, the doctrine of salves for broken\r\nheads, of putty for _broken windows_, &c. &c. &c.\r\n\r\n                    *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n_NUMBER II._\r\n\r\nWe now return to the dying drummer, whom we left in the middle of his\r\neulogy on the Marquis of Buckingham.\r\n\r\nIt being admitted, that the powers of the human mind depend on the\r\nnumber and association of our ideas, it is easy to shew that the\r\nillustrious Marquis is entitled to the highest rank in the scale of\r\nhuman intelligence. His mind possesses an unlimited power of\r\ninglutition, and his ideas adhere to each other with such tenacity,\r\nthat whenever his memory is stimulated by any powerful interrogatory,\r\nit not only discharges a full answer to that individual question, but\r\nlikewise such a prodigious flood of collateral knowledge, derived from\r\ncopious and repeated infusions, as no common skull would be capable of\r\ncontaining. For these reasons, his Lordship's fitness for the\r\ndepartment of the Admiralty, a department connected with the whole\r\ncyclopoedia of science, and requiring the greatest variety of talents\r\nand exertions, seems to be pointed out by the hand of Heaven;--it is\r\nlikewise pointed out by the dying drummer, who describes in the\r\nfollowing lines, the immediate cause of his nomination:--\r\n\r\n  On the great day, when Buckingham, by pairs\r\n  Ascended, Heaven impell'd, the K------'s back-stairs;\r\n  And panting breathless, strain'd his lungs to show\r\n  From Fox's bill what mighty ills would flow:\r\n  That soon, _its source corrupt, Opinion's thread,\r\n  On India's deleterious streams wou'd shed_;\r\n  That Hastings, Munny Begum, Scott, must fall,\r\n  And Pitt, and Jenkinson, and Leadenhall;\r\n  Still, as with stammering tongue, he told his tale,\r\n  Unusual terrors Brunswick's heart assail;\r\n  Wide starts his white wig from his royal ear,\r\n  And each particular hair stands stiff with fear,\r\n\r\nWe flatter ourselves that few of our readers are so void of taste,\r\nas not to feel the transcendant beauties of this description. First,\r\nwe see the noble Marquis mount the fatal steps \"by pairs,\" _i.e._ by\r\ntwo at a time; and with a degree of effort and fatigue: and then he is\r\nout of breath, which is perfectly natural. The obscurity of the third\r\ncouplet, an _obscurity_ which has been imitated by all the ministerial\r\nwriters on the India bill, arises from a confusion of metaphor,\r\nso inexpressibly beautiful, that Mr. Hastings has thought fit to copy\r\nit almost verbatum, in his celebrated letter from Lucknow. The effects\r\nof terror on the royal wig, are happily imagined, and are infinitely\r\nmore sublime than the \"_steteruntque comæ_\" of the Roman poet; as the\r\nattachment of a wig to its wearer, is obviously more generous and\r\ndisinterested than that of the person's own hair, which naturally\r\nparticipates in the good or ill fortune of the head on which it grows.\r\nBut to proceed.--Men in a fright are usually generous;--on that great\r\nday, therefore, the Marquis obtained the promise of the Admiralty.\r\nThe dying drummer then proceeds to describe the Marquis's well-known\r\nvision, which he prefaces by a compliment on his Lordship's\r\nextraordinary proficiency in the art of lace-making. We have all\r\nadmired the parliamentary exertions of this great man, on every\r\nsubject that related to an art in which the county of Buckingham is so\r\ndeeply interested; an art, by means of which Britannia (as our author\r\nhappily expresses it)\r\n\r\n  Puckers round naked breasts, a decent trimming,\r\n  Spreads the thread trade, and propagates old women!\r\n\r\nHow naturally do we feel disposed to join with the dying drummer, in\r\nthe pathetic apostrophe which he addresses to his hero, when he\r\nforesees that this attention will necessarily be diverted to other\r\nobjects:--\r\n\r\n  Alas! no longer round thy favorite STOWE,\r\n  Shalt thou the nicer arts to artists show,\r\n  No more on thumb-worn cushions deign to trace,\r\n  With critic touch, the texture of bone-lace;\r\n  And from severer toils, some moments robbing!\r\n  Reclaim the vagrant thread, or truant bobbin!\r\n  Far, other scenes of future glory rise,\r\n  To glad thy sleeping, and thy waking eyes;\r\n  As busy fancy paints the gaudy dream,\r\n  Ideal docks, with shadowy navies teem:\r\n  Whate'er on sea, on lake, or river floats,\r\n  Ships, barges, rafts, skiffs, tubs, flat-bottom'd boats,\r\n  Smiths, sailors, carpenters, in busy crowds,\r\n  Mast, cable, yard, sail, bow-sprit, anchor, shrowds,\r\n  Knives, gigs, harpoons, swords, handspikes, cutlass blades,\r\n  Guns, pistols, swivels, cannons, carronades:\r\n  All rise to view!--All blend in gorgeous show!\r\n  Tritons and tridents, turpentine, tar--tow!\r\n\r\nWe will take upon ourselves to attest, that neither Homer nor Virgil\r\never produced any thing like this. How amiable, how interesting,\r\nis the condescension of the illustrious Marquis, while he assists the\r\nold women in his neighbourhood in making bone-lace! How artfully is\r\nthe modest appearance of the aforesaid old women's cushions (which we\r\nare also told were dirty cushions) contrasted with the splendor and\r\nmagnificence of the subsequent vision! How masterly is the structure\r\nof the last verse, and how nobly does the climax rise from tritons and\r\ntridents--from objects which are rather picturesque than necessary--to\r\nthat most important article _tow_! an article \"without which,\" in\r\nthe opinion of Lord Mulgrave, \"it would be impossible to fit out a\r\nsingle ship.\"\r\n\r\nThe drummer is next led to investigate the different modes of\r\nmeliorating our navy; in the course of which he introduces the\r\nMarquis's private thoughts on _flax_ and _forest-trees_; the natural\r\nhistory of _nettles_, with proofs of their excellence in making\r\ncables; a project to produce _aurum fulminans_ from Pinchbeck's metal,\r\ninstead of gold, occasioned by admiral Barrington's complaint of bad\r\npowder; a discussion of Lord Ferrers's mathematical mode of\r\nship-building; and a lamentation on the pertinacity with which his\r\nLordship's vessels have hitherto refused to sail. The grief of the\r\nMarquis on this occasion, awaking all our sympathy--\r\n\r\n  Sighing, he struck his breast, and cried, \"Alas!\r\n  Shall a three decker's huge unwieldy mass,\r\n  'Mid croud of foes, stand stupidly at bay,\r\n  And by rude force, like Ajax, gain the day?\r\n  No!--let Invention!------\"\r\n\r\nAnd at the moment his Lordship becomes pregnant, and is delivered of\r\na project that solves every difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe reader will recollect Commodore Johnstone's discovery, that\r\n\"the aliquot parts being equal to the whole, two frigates are\r\nindisputably tantamount to a line of battle-ship; nay, that they are\r\nsuperior to it, as being more manageable.\" Now, a sloop being more\r\ndocile than a frigate, and a cutter more versatile than a sloop,\r\n&c. &c. is it not obvious that the _force_ of any vessel must be in an\r\ninverse ratio to its _strength_? Hence, Lord Buckingham most properly\r\nobserves,\r\n\r\n  Our light arm'd fleet will spread a general panic,\r\n  For speed is power, says Pinchbeck, the mechanic.\r\n\r\nThe only objection to this system, is the trite professional idea,\r\nthat ships having been for some years past in the habit of sailing\r\ndirectly forwards, must necessarily form and fight _in a straight\r\nline_; but according to Lord Buckingham's plan, the line of battle in\r\nfuture is to be like the line of beauty, _waving_ and _tortuous_; so\r\nthat if the French, who confessedly are the most imitative people on\r\nthe earth, should wish to copy our manoeuvres, their larger ships will\r\nnecessarily be thrown into confusion, and consequently be beaten.\r\n\r\nBut as Sir Gregory Page Turner finely says, \"infallibility is not\r\ngiven to human nature.\" Our prodigious Marquis, therefore, diffident\r\nof his talents, and not yet satisfied with his plan, rakes into that\r\nvast heap of knowledge, which he has collected from reading, and forms\r\ninto one _compost_, all the naval inventions of every age and country,\r\nin order to meliorate and fertilize the colder genius of Great\r\nBritain. \"In future,\" says the drummer,\r\n\r\n  All ages, and all countries, shall combine,\r\n  To form our navy's variegated line.\r\n  Like some vast whale, or all-devouring shark,\r\n  High in the midst shall rise old Noah's _ark_:\r\n  Or, if that ark be lost, of equal bulk,\r\n  Our novel Noah rigs--the _Justice Hulk_:\r\n  An Argo next, the peerless Catherine sends,\r\n  The gorgeous gift of her _Mingrelian_ friends:\r\n\r\nHere we cannot repress our admiration at the drummer's skill in\r\ngeography and politics. He not only tells us that _Mingrelia_ is the\r\nancient _Colchis_, the country visited by the Argonauts, the country\r\nwhich was then so famous for its fleeces, and which even now sends so\r\nmany virgins to the Grand Seignior's seraglio, but he foresees the\r\nadvantages that will be derived to the navy of this kingdom, by the\r\nsubmission of his Mingrelian majesty to the Empress of Russia.\r\nBut to proceed:\r\n\r\n    And next, at our Canadian brethren's pray'r,\r\n    Ten stout _triremes_ the good pope shall spare!\r\n\r\nWe apprehend, with all due submission to the drummer, that here is a\r\nsmall mistake. Our Canadian brethren may indeed possess great\r\ninfluence with the Pope, on account of their perseverance in the\r\nCatholic religion; but as all the triremes in his holiness's\r\npossession are unfortunately in bass-relief and marble, we have some\r\ndoubt of their utility at sea.\r\n\r\n  Light-arm'd _evaas_, canoes that seem to fly,\r\n  Our faithful _Oberea_ shall supply:\r\n  _Gallies_ shall Venice yield. Algiers, _xebecs_--\r\n  But thou, Nanquin, gay _yachts_ with towering decks;\r\n  While fierce Kamtschatka------\r\n\r\nBut it is unnecessary to transcribe all the names of places mentioned\r\nby our drummer in sailing eastward towards Cape Horn, and westward to\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope. We flatter ourselves that we have sufficiently\r\nproved the stupendous and almost unnatural excellence of the new\r\nLord Buckingham; and that we have shewn the necessity of innovation in\r\nthe navy as well as in the constitution; we therefore shall conclude\r\nthis number, by expressing our hope and assurance, that the salutary\r\namputations which are meditated by the two state surgeons, Mr. Pitt,\r\nand Mr. Wyvill, will speedily be followed by equally skilful\r\noperations in our marine; and that the prophecy of the dying drummer\r\nwill be fulfilled in the completion of that delightful event--the\r\nnomination of the noble Marquis to the department of the admiralty!\r\n\r\n                    *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n_NUMBER III._\r\n\r\nHaving concluded his description of the Marquis of Buckingham,\r\nour expiring prophet proceeds to the contemplation of other glories,\r\nhardly less resplendent than those of the noble Marquis himself.\r\nHe goes on to the DUKE of RICHMOND.\r\n\r\nIn travelling round this wide world of virtue, for as such may the\r\nmind of the noble Duke be described, it must be obvious to every one,\r\nthat the principal difficulty consists--in determining from what\r\nquarter to set out; whether to commence in the _frigid zone_ of his\r\nbenevolence, or in the _torrid hemisphere_ of his loyalty; from the\r\n_equinox_ of his oeconomy, or from the _terra australis_ of his\r\npatriotism. Our author feels himself reduced to the dilemma of the\r\nfamous _Archimedes_ in this case, though for a very different reason,\r\nand exclaims violently for the {Dos pou sto}, not because he has no\r\nground to stand upon, but because he has too much--because puzzled by\r\nthe variety, he feels an incapacity to make a selection. He represents\r\nhimself as being exactly in the situation of _Paris_ between the\r\ndifferent and contending charms of the three _Heathen Goddesses_, and\r\nis equally at a loss on which to bestow his _detur pulcherimæ_. There\r\nis indeed more beauty in this latter similitude than may at first view\r\nappear to a careless and vulgar observer: the three goddesses in\r\nquestion being, in all the leading points of their description, most\r\ncorrectly typical of the noble Duke himself. As for example--_Minerva_,\r\nwe know, was produced out of the head of _Jove_, complete and perfect\r\nat once. Thus the Duke of Richmond starts into the perfection of a\r\nfull-grown _engineer_, without the ceremony of gradual organization,\r\nor the painful tediousness of progressive maturity.--_Juno_ was\r\nparticularly famed for an unceasing spirit of active persecution\r\nagainst the bravest and most honourable men of antiquity. Col.\r\n_Debbeige_, and some other individuals of modern time, might be\r\nselected, to shew that the noble Duke is not in this respect without\r\nsome pretensions to sympathy with the queen of the skies.--_Venus_\r\ntoo, we all know, originated from _froth_. For resemblance in this\r\npoint, _vide_ the noble Duke's admirable theories on the subject of\r\n_parliamentary melioration_.\r\n\r\nHaving stated these circumstances of embarrassment in a few\r\nintroductory lines to this part of the poem, our author goes on\r\nto observe, that not knowing, after much and anxious thought, how to\r\nadjust the important difficulty in question, he resolves at last to\r\ntrust himself entirely to the guidance of his muse, who, under the\r\ninfluence of her usual inspiration, proceeds as follows:\r\n\r\n  Hail thou, for either talent justly known,\r\n  To spend the nation's cash--or keep thy own;\r\n  Expert alike to save, or be profuse,\r\n  As money goes for thine, or England's use;\r\n  In whose esteem, of equal worth are thought,\r\n  A public million, and a private groat.\r\n  Hail, and--&c.\r\n\r\n_Longinus_, as the learned well know, reckons the figure\r\n_Amplification_ amongst the principal sources of the sublime, as does\r\n_Quintilian_ amongst the leading requisites of rhetoric. That it\r\nconstitutes the very soul of eloquence, is demonstrable from the\r\nexample of that sublimest of all orators, and profoundest of all\r\nstatesman, Mr. _William Pitt_. If no expedient had been devised, by\r\nthe help of which the _same_ idea could be invested in a thousand\r\ndifferent and glittering habiliments, by which _one_ small spark of\r\nmeaning could be inflated into a blaze of elocution, how many\r\ndelectable speeches would have been lost to the Senate of Great\r\nBritain? How severe an injury would have been sustained to the\r\nliterary estimation of the age? The above admirable specimen of the\r\nfigure, however, adds to the other natural graces of it, the excellent\r\nrecommendation of strict and literal truth. The author proceeds to\r\ndescribe the noble Duke's uncommon popularity, and to represent, that\r\nwhatever be his employment, whether the gay business of the state, or\r\nthe serious occupation of amusement, his Grace is alike sure of the\r\napprobation of his countrymen.\r\n\r\n  Whether thy present vast ambition be\r\n  To check the rudeness of the' intruding sea;\r\n  Or else, immerging in a _civil_ storm,\r\n  With equal wisdom to project--reform;\r\n  Whether thou go'st while summer suns prevail,\r\n  To enjoy the freshness of thy kitchen's gale,\r\n  Where, unpolluted by luxurious heat,\r\n  Its large expanse affords a cool retreat;\r\n  Or should'st thou now, no more the theme of mirth,\r\n  Hail the great day that gave thy sov'reign birth,\r\n  With kind anticipating zeal prepare,\r\n  And make the _fourth_ of _June_ thy anxious care;\r\n  O! wheresoe'er thy hallow'd steps shall stray\r\n  Still, still, for thee, the grateful poor shall pray,\r\n  Since all the bounty which thy heart denies,\r\n  Drain'd by thy schemes, the _treasury_ supplies.\r\n\r\nThe reference to the noble Duke's kitchen, is a most exquisite\r\ncompliment to his Grace's well-known and determined aversion to the\r\nspecious, popular, and prevailing vices of _eating_ and _drinking_;\r\nand the four lines which follow, contain a no less admirable allusion\r\nto the memorable witticism of his Grace (memorable for the subject of\r\nit, as well as for the circumstance of its being the only known\r\ninstance of his Grace's attempting to degrade himself into the\r\nvulgarity of joke).\r\n\r\nWhen a minister was found in this country daring and wicked enough to\r\npropose the suspension of a turnpike bill for one whole day, simply\r\nfor the reason, that he considered some little ceremony due to the\r\nnatal anniversary of the _highest_, and beyond all comparison, the\r\n_best_ individual in the country; what was the noble Duke's reply to\r\nthis frivolous pretence for the protraction of the national business?\r\n\"What care I,\" said this great personage, with a noble warmth of\r\npatriotic insolence, never yet attained by any of the present\r\ntimid-minded sons of faction, \"What care I for the King's birthday!--What\r\nis such nonsense to me!\" &c. &c. &c. It is true, indeed, times have been\r\na little changed since--but what of that! there is a solid truth in\r\nthe observation of Horace, which its tritism does not, nor cannot\r\ndestroy, and which the noble Duke, if he could read the original,\r\nmight with great truth, apply to himself and his sovereign:\r\n\r\n  Tempora mutantur, et nos mutamur in illis.\r\n\r\nA great critic affirms, that the highest excellence of writing, and\r\nparticularly of poetical writing, consists in this one power--to\r\n_surprise_. Surely this sensation was never more successfully excited,\r\nthan by the line in the above passage, when considered as addressed\r\nto the Duke of Richmond--\r\n\r\n    Still, still, for thee, the _grateful poor_ shall pray!\r\n\r\nOur author, however, whose correct judgment suggested to him, that\r\neven the sublimity of surprise was not to be obtained at the expence\r\nof truth and probability, hastens to reconcile all contradictions, by\r\ninforming the reader, that the _treasury_ is to supply the sources of\r\nthe charity, on account of which the noble Duke is to be prayed for.\r\n\r\nThe poet, with his usual philanthropy, proceeds to give a piece\r\nof good advice to a person, with whom he does not appear at first\r\nsight to have any natural connexion. He contrives, however,\r\neven to make his seeming digression contribute to his purpose.\r\nHe addresses _Colonel Debbeige_ in the following goodnatured,\r\nsublime and parental apostrophe--\r\n\r\n  Learn, thoughtless _Debbeige_, now no more a youth,\r\n  The woes unnumber'd that encompass truth.\r\n  Nor of experience, nor of knowledge vain,\r\n  Mock the chimæras of a sea-sick brain:\r\n  Oh, learn on happier terms with him to live,\r\n  Who ne'er knew _twice_, the weakness to forgive!\r\n  Then should his grace some vast expedient find,\r\n  To govern tempests, and controul the wind;\r\n  Should he, like great _Canute_, forbid the wave,\r\n  T'approach his presence, or his foot to lave;\r\n  Construct some bastion, or contrive some mound,\r\n  The world's wide limits to encompass round;\r\n  Rear a redoubt, that to the stars should rise,\r\n  And lift himself, like Typhon, to the skies;\r\n  Or should the mightier scheme engage his soul,\r\n  To raise a platform on the _northern pole_,\r\n  With foss, with rampart, stick, and stone, and clay,\r\n  To build a breast-work on the _milky-way_,\r\n  Or to protect his sovereign's blest abode,\r\n  Bid numerous batteries guard the _turnpike road_;\r\n  Lest foul Invasion in disguise approach,\r\n  Or Treason lurk within the _Dover_ coach.\r\n  Oh, let the wiser duty then be thine,\r\n  Thy skill, thy science, judgment to resign!\r\n  With patient ear, the high-wrapt tale attend,\r\n  Nor snarl at fancies which no skill can mend.\r\n  So shall thy comforts with thy days increase,\r\n  And all thy last, unlike thy first, be peace;\r\n  No rude _courts martial_ shall thy fame decry,\r\n  But half-pay plenty all thy wants supply.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to determine which part of the above passage possesses\r\nthe superior claim to our admiration, whether its science, its\r\nresemblance, its benevolence, or its sublimity.--Each has its turn,\r\nand each is distinguished by some of our author's happiest touches.\r\nThe climax from the pole oft the heavens to the pole of a coach, and\r\nfrom the milky-way to a turnpike road, is conceived and exprest with\r\nadmirable fancy and ability. The absurd story of the wooden horse in\r\nVirgil, is indeed remotely parodied in the line,\r\n\r\n  Or Treason lurk within the Dover coach,\r\n\r\nbut with what accession of beauty, nature, and probability, we leave\r\njudicious critics to determine. Indeed there is no other defence for\r\nthe passage alluded to in _Virgil_, but to suppose that the past\r\ncommentators upon it have been egregiously mistaken, and that this\r\nfamous _equus ligneus_, of which he speaks, was neither more nor less\r\nthan the _stage coach_ of antiquity. What, under any other\r\nsupposition, can be the meaning of the passage\r\n\r\n  Aut hoc inclusi ligno occultantur _Achivi?_\r\n\r\nBesides this, the term _machina_ we know is almost constantly used by\r\n_Virgil_ himself as a synonyme for this horse, as in the line\r\n\r\n  _Scandit fatalis_ machina _muros_, &c.\r\n\r\nAnd do we not see that those authentic records of modern literature,\r\nthe newspapers, are continually and daily announcing to us--\"This day\r\nsets off from the Blue-boar Inn, precisely at half past five, the Bath\r\nand Bristol _machine_!\" meaning thereby merely the _stage coaches_ to\r\nBath and to Bristol. Again, immediately after the line last quoted (to\r\nwit, _scandit fatalis machina muros)_ come these words,\r\n\r\n  _Fæta armis_, i.e. filled with _arms_.\r\n\r\nNow what can they possibly allude to, in the eye of sober judgment and\r\nrational criticism, but the _guard_, or armed _watchman_, who, in\r\nthose days, went in the inside, or perhaps had a place in the _boot_,\r\nand was employed, as in our modern conveyances, to protect the\r\npassenger in his approximation to the metropolis. We trust the above\r\nauthorities will be deemed conclusive upon the subject; and indeed, to\r\nsay the truth, this idea does not occur to us now for the first time,\r\nas in some hints for a few critical lucubrations intended as farther\r\n_addenda_ to the _Virgilius Restauratus_ of the great Scriblerus, we\r\nfind this remark precisely:--\"In our judgment, this horse (meaning\r\n_Virgil_'s) may be very properly denominated--the DARDANIAN DILLY, or\r\nthe POST COACH to PERGAMUS.\"\r\n\r\nWe know not whether it be worth adding as a matter of mere fact,\r\nthat the great object of the noble Duke's erections at Chatham,\r\nwhich have not yet cost the nation a _million_, is simply and\r\nexclusively this--to _enfilade_ the turnpike road, in case of a\r\nforeign invasion.\r\n\r\nThe poet goes on--he forms a scientific and interesting presage of\r\nthe noble Duke's future greatness.\r\n\r\n  With gorges, scaffolds, breaches, ditches, mines,\r\n  With culverins, whole and demi, and gabines;\r\n  With trench, with counterscarp, with esplanade,\r\n  With curtain, moat, and rhombo, and chamade;\r\n  With polygon, epaulement, hedge and bank,\r\n  With angle salient, and with angle flank:\r\n  Oh! thou shall prove, should all thy schemes prevail,\r\n  An UNCLE TOBY on a larger scale.\r\n  While dapper, daisy, prating, puffing JIM,\r\n  May haply personate good _Corporal Trim_.\r\n\r\nEvery reader will anticipate us in the recollection, that the person\r\nhere honoured with our author's distinction, by the abbreviated\r\nappellative of _Jim_, can be no other than the Hon. James Luttrel\r\nhimself, surveyor-general to the ordnance, the famous friends,\r\ndefender, and _commis_ of the Duke of Richmond. The words _dapper_ and\r\n_daisy_, in the last line of the above passage, approximate perhaps\r\nmore nearly to the familiarity of common life, than is usual with our\r\nauthor; but it is to be observed in the defence of them, that our\r\nlanguage supplies no terms in any degree so peculiarly characteristic\r\nof the object to whom they are addressed. As for the remaining part of\r\nthe line, to wit, \"_prating, puffing Jim_,\" it will require no\r\nvindication or illustration with those who have heard this honourable\r\ngentleman's speeches in parliament, and who have read the subsequent\r\nrepresentations of them in the diurnal prints.\r\n\r\nOur immortal author, whose province it is to give poetical\r\nconstruction, and _local habitation_ to the inspired effusions of the\r\n_dying drummer_ (exactly as _Virgil_ did to the predictions of\r\n_Anchises_), proceeds to finish the portrait exhibited in the above\r\npassage by the following lines--\r\n\r\n  As like your _prototypes_ as pea to pea,\r\n  Save in the weakness of--_humanity_;\r\n  Congenial quite in every other part,\r\n  The same in _head_, but differing in the heart.\r\n\r\n                    *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n_NUMBER IV._\r\n\r\nWe resume with great pleasure our critical lucubrations on that most\r\ninteresting part of this divine poem, which pourtrays the character,\r\nand transmits to immortality the name of the _Duke of_ RICHMOND.--Our\r\nauthor, who sometimes condescends to a casual imitation of ancient\r\nwriters, employs more than usual pains in the elaborate delineation of\r\nthis illustrious personage. Thus, in Virgil, we find whole pages\r\ndevoted to the description of _Æneas_, while _Glacus_ and\r\n_Thersilochus_, like the _Luttrels_, the _Palkes_, or the _Macnamaras_\r\nof modern times, are honoured only with the transient distinction of a\r\nsimple mention. He proceeds to ridicule the superstition which exists\r\nin this country, and, as he informs us, had also prevailed in one of\r\nthe most famous states of antiquity, that a navy could be any source\r\nof security to a great empire, or that shipping could in any way be\r\nconsidered as the _natural_ defence of an _island_.\r\n\r\n  Th' Athenian sages, once of old, 'tis said,\r\n  Urg'd by their country's love--by wisdom led,\r\n  Besought the _Delphic_ oracle to show\r\n  What best should save them from the neighb'ring foe\r\n  --With holy fervor first the _priestess_ burn'd,\r\n  Then fraught with presage, this reply return'd:\r\n  \"_Your city, men of Athens, ne'er will fall,\r\n  If wisely guarded by a_ WOODEN WALL.\"\r\n  --Thus have our fathers indiscreetly thought,\r\n  By ancient practice--ancient safety taught,\r\n  That this, Great Britain, still should prove to thee\r\n  Thy first, thy best, thy last security;\r\n  That what in thee we find or great or good,\r\n  Had ow'd its being to this WALL of WOOD.--\r\n  Above such weakness see great _Lenox_ soar,\r\n  This fence prescriptive guards us now no more\r\n  Of such gross ignorance asham'd and sick,\r\n  Richmond protects us with a _wall--of brick_;\r\n  Contemns the prejudice of former time,\r\n  And saves his countrymen by _lath_ and _lime_.\r\n\r\nIt is our intention to embarrass this part of the _Rolliad_ as little\r\nas possible with any commentaries of our own. We cannot, however,\r\nresist the temptation which the occasion suggests, of pronouncing\r\na particular panegyric upon the delicacy as well as dexterity of our\r\nauthor, who, in speaking upon the subject of the Duke of _Richmond_,\r\nthat is, upon a man who knows no more of the history, writings,\r\nor languages of antiquity than the _Marquis of Lansdown_ himself,\r\nor great _Rollo_'s groom, has yet contrived to collect a great portion\r\nof his illustrations from the sources of ancient literature. By this\r\nadmirable expedient, the immediate ignorance of the hero is inveloped\r\nand concealed in the vast erudition of the author, and the unhappy\r\ntruth that his Grace never proceeded farther in his _Latinity_, than\r\nthrough the neat and simple pages of _Corderius_, is so far thrown\r\ninto the back ground as to be hardly observable, and to constitute no\r\nessential blemish to the general brilliancy of the _picture_.\r\n\r\nThe poet proceeds to speak of a tribunal which was instituted in the\r\n_æra_ he is describing, for an investigation into the professional\r\nmerits of the noble Duke, and of which he himself was very properly\r\nthe head. The author mentions the individuals who composed this\r\ninquisition, as men of _opulent, independent, disinterested_\r\ncharacters, three only excepted, whom he regrets as apostates to the\r\ngeneral character of the arbitrators. He speaks, however--such is the\r\nomnipotence of truth--even of them, with a sort of reluctant tendency\r\nto panegyric. He says,\r\n\r\n  Keen without show, with modest learning, sly,\r\n  The subtle comment speaking in his eye;\r\n  Of manners polish'd, yet of stubborn soul,\r\n  Which Hope allures not--nor which fears control;\r\n  See _Burgoyne_ rapt in all a soldier's pride,\r\n  Damn with a shrug, and with a look deride;\r\n  While coarse _Macbride_ a busier task assumes,\r\n  And tears with graceless rage our hero's plumes;\r\n  Blunts his rude science in the _chieftain_'s face,\r\n  Nor deems--forgive him, _Pitt!_--a truth, disgrace:\r\n  And _Percy_ too, of lineage justly vain,\r\n  Surveys the system with a mild disdain.\r\n\r\nHe consoles the reader, however, for the pain given him by the\r\ncontemplation of such weakness and injustice, by hastening to\r\ninform him of the better and wiser dispositions of the other members\r\nof the tribunal;\r\n\r\n  --But ah! not so the rest--unlike to these,\r\n  They try each anxious blandishment to please;\r\n  No skill uncivil e'er from them escapes,\r\n  Their modest wisdom courts no dang'rous scrapes;\r\n  But pure regard comes glowing from the heart,\r\n  To take a friend's--to take a master's part;\r\n  Nor let Suspicion with her sneers convey,\r\n  That paltry Int'rest could with such bear sway.\r\n  Can _Richmond_'s brother be attach'd to gold?\r\n  Can _Luttrell_'s friendship, like a vote, be sold?\r\n  O can such petty, such ignoble crimes,\r\n  Stain the fair _æra_ of these golden times,\r\n  When _Pitt_ to all perfection points the way,\r\n  And pure _Dundas_ exemplifies his lay?\r\n  When _Wilkes_ to loyalty makes bold pretence,\r\n  _Arden_ to law, the _Cabinet_ to sense;\r\n  When _Prettyman_ affects for truth a zeal,\r\n  And _Macnamaras_ guard the common-weal;\r\n  When _lawyers_ argue from the holy writ,\r\n  And _Hill_ would vie with _Sheridan_ in wit;\r\n  When _Camden_, first of Whigs, in struggles past,\r\n  _Teiz'd_ and _tormented_ quits the cause at last;\r\n  When _Thurlow_ strives commercial skill to show,\r\n  And even _Sydney_ something seems to know;\r\n  When honest _Jack_ declines in men to trade,\r\n  And court majorities by truth are sway'd;\r\n  When _Baker, Conway, Cavendish, or Byng_,\r\n  No more an obloquy o'er senates fling;\r\n  When------\r\n\r\nBut where could a period be put to the enumeration of the _uncommon_\r\nappearances of the epoch in question?--The application of the term\r\n_honest_, prefixed to the name of the person described in the last\r\nline of the above passage but three, sufficiently circumscribes the\r\nnumber of those particular _Jacks_ who were at this moment in the\r\ncontemplation of our author, and lets us with facility into the secret\r\nthat he could mean no other than the worthy Mr. _John Robinson_\r\nhimself.--The peculiar species of traffic that the poet represents\r\nMr. Robinson to have dealt in, is supposed to allude to a famous\r\noccurrence of these times, when Mr. R. and another contractor agreed,\r\nin a ministerial emergency, to furnish government with _five hundred\r\nand fifty-eight_ ready, willing, obedient, well-trained men, at so\r\nmuch per head per man, whom they engaged to be _perfectly fit for\r\nany work the minister could put them to_. Tradition says, they failed\r\nin their contract by somewhat about _two hundred_.--We have not heard\r\nof what particular complexion the first order were of, but suppose\r\nthem to have been _blacks_.\r\n\r\nWe collect from history, that the noble Duke had been exposed to\r\nmuch empty ridicule on account of his having been, as they termed it,\r\na judge in his own cause, by being the President of that Court,\r\nwhose exclusive jurisdiction it was to enquire into supposed official\r\nerrors imputed to himself. The author scouts the venom of those\r\nimpotent gibers, and with great triumph exclaims,\r\n\r\n  If it be virtue but yourself to _know_,\r\n  Yourself to _judge_, is sure a virtue too.\r\n\r\nNothing can be more obvious--all judgment depends upon knowledge;\r\nand how can any other person be supposed to know a man so well as he\r\ndoes himself? We hope soon to see this evidently equitable principle\r\nof criminal jurisprudence fully established at the _Old Baily_; and we\r\nare very much inclined to think, that if every _house-breaker, &c._\r\nwas in like manner permitted to judge himself, the susceptible heart\r\nwould not be altogether so often shocked with spectacles of human\r\nmassacre before the gates of Newgate, as, to the great disgrace of our\r\npenal system, it now is.\r\n\r\nOur author now proceeds to speak of a transaction which he seems\r\nto touch upon with reluctance. It respects a young nobleman of these\r\ntimes, of the name of _Rawdon_. It is very remarkable, that the last\r\ncouplet of this passage is printed with a scratch through the lines,\r\nas if it had been the author's intention to have erazed them. Whether\r\nhe thought the event alluded to in this distich was too disgraceful\r\nfor justification--or that the justification suggested was\r\nincomplete--that the image contained in them was too familiar and\r\npuerile for the general sublimity of his great poem, or whatever he\r\nthought, we know not, but such is the fact. The passage is as\r\nfollows:--after relating the circumstance, he says\r\n\r\n    Association forms the mind's great chain,\r\n    By plastic union many a thought we gain,\r\n[Struck-through:\r\n    (Thus _Raw_ suggested _Raw head_, and the _Don_,\r\n    Haply reminded him of _Bloody bone)_.]\r\n\r\nTo the justice of the disgrace thrown upon the above couplet, we by\r\nno means concede.--What it wants in poetical construction, it amply\r\nmakes up in the deep knowledge which it contains of the more latent\r\nfeelings of the human heart, and its philosophic detection of some of\r\nthe true sources of human action. We all know how long, and how\r\ntenaciously, original prejudices stick by us. No man lives long enough\r\nto get rid of his nursery. That the noble duke therefore might not\r\nbe free from the common influence of a very common sensation, no one\r\ncan reasonably wonder at, and the best proof that he was not so is,\r\nthat we defy any person to show us, upon what possible principle,\r\nif not upon this, the conduct of the noble Duke, in the transaction\r\nalluded to, is to be explained or defended. The Duke of Richmond--a\r\ngentleman by a thousand pretensions--a soldier--a legislator--a\r\npeer--in two countries a duke--in a third a prince--a man whose honour\r\nis not a mere point of speculative courtesy, but is his\r\n_oath_--impeaches the reputation of another individual of pure and\r\nunblemished character; and with the same publicity that he had applied\r\nthe original imputation, this peer, prince, legislator, and soldier,\r\n_eats_ every syllable he had said, and retracts every _item_ of his\r\ncharge. Is this to be credited without a resort to some principle of a\r\nvery paramount nature in the heart of man indeed? Is the original\r\ndepravity, in the first instance, of publicly attempting to sully the\r\nfair honour of that interesting and sacred character, a youthful\r\nsoldier, or the meanness in the second, of an equally public and\r\nunprecedentedly pusillanimous retraction of the whole of the calumny,\r\nto be believed in so high a personage as the Duke of _Richmond_,\r\nwithout a reference to a cause of a very peculiar kind, to an impulse\r\nof more than ordinary potency? Evidently not.--And what is there, as\r\nwe have before observed, that adheres so closely, or controuls so\r\nabsolutely, as the legends of our boyish days, of the superstitions of\r\na nursery? For these reasons, therefore, we give our most decided\r\nsuffrage for the full re-establishment of the couplet to the fair\r\nlegitimate honours that are due to it.\r\n\r\nThe poet concludes his portrait of this illustrious person, with the\r\nfollowing lines--\r\n\r\n  The triple honours that adorn his head,\r\n  A three-fold influence o'er his virtue shed;\r\n  As _Gallia_'s prince, behold him proud and vain;\r\n  Thrifty and close as _Caledonia_'s thane;\r\n  In _Richmond_'s duke, we trace our own JOHN BULL,\r\n  Of schemes enamour'd--and of schemes--the GULL.\r\n\r\n                    *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n_NUMBER V._\r\n\r\nThe author of the Rolliad has, in his last edition, introduced so\r\nconsiderable an alteration, that we should hold ourselves inexcusable,\r\nafter the very favourable reception our commentaries have been\r\nhonoured with, in omitting to seize the earliest opportunity of\r\npointing it out to the public.\r\n\r\nFinding the variety and importance of the characters he is called upon\r\nto describe, likely to demand a greater portion both of time and words\r\nthan an expiring man can be reasonably supposed to afford, instead of\r\nleaving the whole description of that illustrious assembly, of which\r\nthe dying drummer has already delineated some of the principal\r\nornaments, to the same character, he has made an addition to the\r\nvision in which the House of Commons is represented, at the conclusion\r\nof the Sixth Book, by contriving that the lantern of Merlin should be\r\nshifted in such a manner, as to display at once to the eager eye of\r\nRollo, the whole interior of the Upper House; to gain a seat in which\r\nthe hero immediately expresses a laudable impatience, as well as a\r\njust indignation, on beholding persons, far less worthy than himself,\r\namong those whom the late very numerous creations prevent our\r\ncalling--\r\n\r\n  ----_pauci--quos æquus amavit\r\n      Jupiter_--\r\n\r\nWith still less propriety, perhaps we should add--\r\n\r\n  --_Aut ardens evexit ad æthera virtus._         VIRG.\r\n\r\nThe hero's displeasure is thus forcibly described:\r\n\r\n  Zounds! quoth great _Rollo_, with indignant frown,\r\n  'Mid British nobles shall a base-born clown,\r\n  With air imperious ape a monarch's nod,\r\n  Less fit to sit there than my groom, by G-d[1]?\r\n\r\nLonginus, in his chapter on interrogations, proves them to be a source\r\nof the sublime. They are, indeed, says Dr. Young, the proper style of\r\nmajesty incensed. Where, therefore, can they be with more propriety\r\nintroduced, than from the mouth of our offended hero? Merlin, after\r\nsympathizing with him in the justice of these feelings, proceeds to\r\na description of the august assembly they are viewing. The author's\r\nreverence for the religion of his country naturally disposes him first\r\nto take notice of the spiritual lords of Parliament--\r\n\r\n  Yon rev'rend prelates, rob'd in sleeves of lawn,\r\n  Too meek to murmur, and too proud to fawn,\r\n  Who still submissive to their Maker's nod,\r\n  Adore their sov'reign, and respect their God;\r\n  And wait, good men! all worldly things forgot,\r\n  In humble hope of Enoch's happy lot.\r\n\r\nWe apprehend that the fourth line, by an error in the press, the words\r\n\"adore and respect,\" must have been misplaced; but our veneration for\r\nour author will not permit us to hazard even the slightest alteration\r\nof the text. The happy ambiguity of the word \"Maker,\" is truly\r\nbeautiful.\r\n\r\nWe are sorry, however, to observe, that modern times afford some\r\ninstances of exceptions to the above description, as well as one\r\nvery distinguished one, indeed, to that which follows of the sixteen\r\nPeers of Scotland:--\r\n\r\n    Alike in loyalty, alike in worth,\r\n    Behold the sixteen nobles of the north;\r\n    Fast friends to monarchy, yet sprung from those\r\n    Who basely sold their monarch to his foes;\r\n    Since which, atoning for their father's crime,\r\n    The sons, as basely, sell themselves to him:\r\n    With ev'ry change prepar'd to change their note,\r\n    With ev'ry government prepar'd to vote,\r\n    Save when, perhaps, on some important bill,\r\n    They know, by second sight, the royal will;\r\n    With royal _Denbigh_ hearing birds that sing,\r\n    \"Oppose the minister to please the king.\"\r\n\r\nThese last lines allude to a well authenticated anecdote, which\r\ndeserves to be recorded as an instance of the interference of divine\r\nProvidence in favour of this country, when her immediate destruction\r\nwas threatened by the memorable India bill, so happily rejected by\r\nthe House of Lords in the year 1783.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of _Denbigh_, a Lord of his Majesty's Bed-chamber, being\r\nnewly married, and solacing himself at his country-seat in the sweats\r\nof matrimonial bliss, to his great astonishment heard, on a winter's\r\nevening, in the cold month of December, a nightingale singing in\r\nthe woods. Having listened with great attention to so extraordinary\r\na phoenomenon, it appeared to his Lordship that the bird distinctly\r\nrepeated the following significant words, in the same manner that\r\nthe bells of London admonished the celebrated Whittington,\r\n\r\n  \"Throw out the India bill;\r\n  Such is your master's will.\"\r\n\r\nHis Lordship immediately communicated this singular circumstance\r\nto the fair partner of his connubial joys, who, for the good of\r\nher country, patriotically, though reluctantly, consented to forego\r\nthe newly tasted delights of wedlock, and permitted her beloved\r\nbridegroom to set out for London, where his Lordship fortunately\r\narrived in time, to co-operate with the rest of his noble and\r\nhonourable brethren, the lords of the king's bed-chamber, in defeating\r\nthat detestable measure; a measure calculated to effect the immediate\r\nruin of this country, by overthrowing the happy system of government\r\nwhich has so long prevailed in our East-India territories.--After\r\nhaving described the above-mentioned classes of nobility, he proceeds\r\nto take notice of the admirable person who so worthily presides in\r\nthis august assembly:--\r\n\r\n  The rugged _Thurlow_, who with sullen scowl,\r\n  In surly mood, at friend and foe will growl;\r\n  Of proud prerogative, the stern support,\r\n  Defends the entrance of great _George_'s court\r\n  'Gainst factious Whigs, lest they who stole the seal,\r\n  The sacred diadem itself should steal:\r\n  So have I seen near village butcher's stall\r\n  (If things so great may be compar'd with small)\r\n  A mastiff guarding, on a market day,\r\n  With snarling vigilance, his master's tray.\r\n\r\nThe fact of a desperate and degraded faction having actually broken\r\ninto the dwelling-house of the Lord High Chancellor, and carried off\r\nthe great seal of England, is of equal notoriety and authenticity\r\nwith that of their having treacherously attempted, when in power,\r\nto transfer the crown of Great-Britain from the head of our most\r\ngracious sovereign to that of their ambitious leader, so justly\r\ndenominated the Cromwell of modern times.\r\n\r\nWhile our author is dwelling on events which every Englishman must\r\nrecollect with heart-felt satisfaction, he is naturally reminded of\r\nthat excellent nobleman, whose character he has, in the mouth of\r\nthe dying drummer, given more at large, and who bore so meritorious\r\na share in that happy revolution which restored to the sovereign of\r\nthese kingdoms the right of nominating his own servants; a right\r\nexercised by every private gentleman in the choice of his butler,\r\ncook, coachman, footman, &c. but which a powerful and wicked\r\naristocratic combination endeavoured to circumscribe in the monarch,\r\nwith respect to the appointment of ministers of state. Upon this\r\noccasion he compares the noble Marquis to the pious hero of the Æneid,\r\nand recollects the description of his conduct during the conflagration\r\nof Troy; an alarming moment, not unaptly likened to that of the\r\nDuke of Portland's administration, when his Majesty, like king Priam,\r\nhad the misfortune of seeing\r\n\r\n  ----_Medium in penctralibus hostem._                 VIRG.\r\n\r\nThe learned reader will bear in mind the description of Æneas:--\r\n\r\n  _Limen ærat, cæcoque fores, &c._                   VIRG.\r\n\r\n  When _Troy_ was burning, and the' insulting foe\r\n  Had well-nigh laid her lofty bulwarks low,\r\n  The good Æneas, to avert her fate,\r\n  Sought _Priam_'s palace through a _postern_ gate:\r\n  Thus when the Whigs, a bold and factious band,\r\n  Had snatch'd the sceptre from their sovereign's hand,\r\n  Up the _back-stairs_ the virtuous _Grenville_ sneaks,\r\n  To rid the closet of those worse than _Greeks_,\r\n  Whose impious tongues audaciously maintain,\r\n  That for their subjects, kings were born to reign.\r\n\r\nThe abominable doctrines of the republican party are here held forth\r\nin their genuine colours, to the detestation of all true lovers of\r\nour happy constitution. The magician then thinks fit to endeavour to\r\npacify the hero's indignation, which we before took notice of,\r\non seeing persons less worthy than himself preferred to the dignity\r\nof peerage, by the mention of two of those newly created, whose\r\npromotion equally reflects the highest honour upon government.\r\n\r\n  _Lonsdale_ and _Camelford_ thrice honour'd names!\r\n  Whose god-like bosoms glow with patriot flames:\r\n  To serve his country, at her utmost need,\r\n  By this, behold a ship of war decreed;\r\n  While that, impell'd by all a convert's zeal,\r\n  Devotes his borough to the public weal.\r\n  But still the wise their second thoughts prefer,\r\n  Thus both our patriots on these gifts demur;\r\n  Ere yet she's launch'd the vessel runs aground,\r\n  And _Sarum_ sells for twice three thousand pound.\r\n\r\nThe generous offers of those public-spirited noblemen, the one during\r\nthe administration of the Marquis of Landsdown, proposing to build\r\na seventy-four-gun ship, for the public service; the other on\r\nMr. Pitt's motion for a parliamentary reform, against which he had\r\nbefore not only voted, but written a pamphlet, declaring his readiness\r\nto make a present of his burgage tenure borough of Old Sarum to the\r\nbank of England, are too fresh in the recollection of their grateful\r\ncountrymen to need being here recorded. With respect, however, to the\r\nsubsequent sale of the borough for the \"twice three thousand pounds,\"\r\nour author does not himself seem perfectly clear, since we afterwards\r\nmeet with these lines:\r\n\r\n  Say, what gave _Camelford_ his wish'd-for rank?\r\n  Did he devote _Old Sarum_ to the Bank?\r\n  Or did he not, that envied rank to gain,\r\n  Transfer the victim to the Treas'ry's fame?\r\n\r\nHis character of the Earl of Lonsdale is too long to be here inserted,\r\nbut is perhaps one of the most finished parts of the whole poem:\r\nwe cannot, however, refrain from transcribing the four following\r\nlines, on account of the peculiar happiness of their expression. The\r\nreader will not forget the declaration of this great man, that he was\r\nin possession of the land, the fire, and the water, of the town\r\nof Whitehaven.\r\n\r\n  E'en by the elements his pow'r confess'd,\r\n  Of mines and boroughs _Lonsdale_ stands possess'd;\r\n  And one sad servitude alike denotes\r\n  The slave that labours, and the slave that votes.\r\n\r\nOur paper now reminds us that it is time to close our observations\r\nfor the present, which we shall do with four lines added by our author\r\nto the former part of the sixth book, in compliment to his favourite,\r\nthe Marquis of Graham, on his late happy marriage.\r\n\r\n  With joy _Britannia_ sees her fav'rite goose\r\n  Fast bound and _pinion'd_ in the nuptial noose;\r\n  Presaging fondly from so fair a mate,\r\n  A brood of goslings, cackling in debate.\r\n\r\n[1] See Mr. Rolle's speech in the parliamentary debates.\r\n\r\n                    *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n_NUMBER VI._\r\n\r\nOur _dying drummer_, in consequence of his extraordinary exertions in\r\ndelineating those exalted personages, the MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM and\r\nDUKE OF RICHMOND; exertions which we think we may venture to pronounce\r\nunparalleled by any one, drummer, or other, similarly circumstanced;\r\nunfortunately found himself so debilitated, that we were very fearful,\r\nlike Balaam's ass, LORD VALLETORT, or any other equally strange\r\nanimal, occasionally endowed with speech, his task being executed,\r\nthat his mouth would for ever after remain incapable of utterance.\r\n\r\nBut though his powers might be suspended, fortunately the\r\n\r\n  ----in æternam clauduntur lumina noctem,\r\n\r\nhas, in consequence of the timely relaxation afforded to the wounded\r\ngentleman during the whole of our last number, been for the present\r\navoided; and, like Mr. PITT's question of parliamentary reform,\r\nadjourned to a more _expedient moment_.\r\n\r\nTo our drummer we might say, as well as to our matchless premier,\r\n\r\n  Larga quidem DRANCE, semper tibi copia fandi,\r\n\r\nwhich, though, some malevolent critics might profligately translate\r\n\r\n  \"There is no end to thy prosing,\"\r\n\r\nthose who have read our drummer's last dying words, or heard our\r\nminister's new made speeches, will admit to be in both instances\r\nequally inapplicable.\r\n\r\nThe natural powers of our author here again burst forth with such\r\nrenovated energy, that, like the swan, his music seems to increase\r\nas his veins become drained.\r\n\r\nAlluding to an event too recent to require elucidation, after\r\ndescribing the virtues of the most amiable personage in the kingdom,\r\nand more particularly applauding her charity, which he says is so\r\nunbounded, that it\r\n\r\n  ------Surmounts dull Nature's ties,\r\n  Nor even to WINCHELSEA a smile denies.\r\n\r\nHe proceeds\r\n\r\n  And thou too, LENOX! worthy of thy name!\r\n  Thou heir to RICHMOND, and to RICHMOND's fame!\r\n  On equal terms, when BRUNSWICK deign'd to grace\r\n  The spurious offspring of the STUART race;\r\n  When thy rash arm design'd her favorite dead,\r\n  The christian triumph'd, and the mother fled:\r\n  No rage indignant shook her pious frame,\r\n  No partial doating swayed the saint-like dame;\r\n  But spurn'd and scorn'd where Honor's sons resort,\r\n  Her friendship sooth'd thee, in thy monarch's court.\r\n\r\nHow much does this meek resignation, in respect to COLONEL LENOX,\r\nappear superior to the pagan rage of MEZENTIUS towards ÆNEAS,\r\non somewhat of a similar occasion, when, instead of desiring him\r\nto dance a minuet at the Etrurian court, he savagely, and of malice\r\nprepense, hurls his spear at the foe of his son, madly exclaiming\r\n\r\n  --Jam venio moriturus et hæc tibi porto\r\n  Dona prius.\r\n\r\nBut our author excels Virgil, as much as the amiable qualities of\r\nthe great personage described, exceed those of MEZENTIUS: that august\r\ncharacter instead of dying, did not so much as faint; and so far\r\nfrom hurling a spear at Mr. LENOX, she did not cast at him even\r\nan angry glance.\r\n\r\n  The christian triumph'd, &c.\r\n\r\nWe are happy in noticing this line, and indeed the whole of the\r\npassage, on another account, as it establishes the orthodoxy of the\r\ndrummer upon so firm a basis, that DR. HORSLEY himself could scarcely\r\nobject to his obtaining a seat in parliament.\r\n\r\nThere is something so extremely ingenious in the following lines,\r\nand they account too on such rational grounds for a partiality that\r\nhas puzzled so many able heads, that we cannot forbear transcribing\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nApostrophizing the exalted personage before alluded to, he says,\r\n\r\n  Early you read, nor did the advice deride,\r\n  Suspicion ne'er should taint a CÆSAR's bride;\r\n  And who in spotless purity so fit\r\n  To guard an honest wife's good fame, as PITT.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful compliment here introduced to the chastity of our\r\nimmaculate premier, from the pen of such an author, must give him\r\nthe most supreme satisfaction. And\r\n\r\n  O decus Italiæ virgo!!!\r\n\r\nLong mayst thou continue to deserve it!!!\r\n\r\nFrom treating of the minister's virgin innocence, our author, by a\r\nvery unaccountable transition, proceeds to a family man, namely,\r\nthe modern MÆCENAS, the CENSOR MORUM, the ARBITER ELEGANTIARUM\r\nof Great Britain; in a word, to the most illustrious JAMES CECIL\r\nEARL OF SALISBURY, and lord chamberlain to his majesty, whom,\r\nin a kind of episode he thus addresses,\r\n\r\n  Oh! had the gods but kindly will'd it so\r\n  That thou had'st lived two hundred years ago:\r\n  Had'st thou then rul'd the stage, from sportive scorn\r\n  Thy prudent care had guarded peers unborn.\r\n  No simple chamberlains had libell'd been,\r\n  No OSTRICKS fool'd in SHAKESPEARE's saucy scene.\r\n\r\nBut then wisely recollecting this not to be altogether the most\r\nfriendly of wishes, in as much, that, if his lordship had been\r\nchamberlain to QUEEN ELIZABETH, he could not, in the common course\r\nof events, have been, as his honour SIR RICHARD PEPPER ARDEN most\r\nsweetly sings in his PROBATIONARY ODE,\r\n\r\n  \"The tallest, fittest man to go before the king,\"\r\n\r\nIn the days of GEORGE THE THIRD; by which we should most probably\r\nnot only have been deprived of the attic entertainments of SIGNORS\r\nDELPINI and CARNEVALE, but perhaps too have lost some of our best\r\ndramatic writers; such as GREATHEAD, HAYLEY, DR. STRATFORD, and\r\nTOMMY VAUGHAN: our author, with a sudden kind of repentance, says,\r\n\r\n  But hence fond thoughts, nor be by passion hurried!\r\n  Had he then lived, he now were dead and buried.\r\n  Not now should theatres his orders own;\r\n  Not now in alehouse signs his face be shewn.\r\n\r\nIf we might be so presumptuous as to impute a fault to our author,\r\nwe should say that he is rather too fond of what the French style\r\n_equivoque_.--This partiality of his breaks forth in a variety of\r\nplaces; such as SIR JOSEPH MAWBEY being\r\n\r\n  ------a knowing man in _grain_,\r\n  ------MARTIN's _sterling_ sense, &c. &c.\r\n\r\nIn the present instance too, where, supposing the noble Marquis\r\nto have lived two hundred years ago, he says,\r\n\r\n    \"Not now should theatres his _orders_ own.\"\r\n\r\nHe leaves us completely in the dark, whether by the word _orders_,\r\nwe are to understand his lordship's commands as _theatrical\r\nanatomist_, or the _recommendations_, which he is pleased to make to\r\nthe managers of our public amusements, to admit his dependants and\r\nservants gratuitously; and which recommendations in the vulgar tongue\r\nof the theatres are technically styled _orders_. If we might hazard\r\nan opinion, from the known condescension of his lordship, and his\r\nattention to the accommodation of his inferiors, we should be inclined\r\nto construe it in the latter sense; an attention, indeed, which,\r\nin the case in question, is said to be so unbounded, that he might\r\nexclaim with ÆNEAS\r\n\r\n  Nemo ex hoc numero mihi non donatus abibit.\r\n\r\nShould any caviler here object, that for every five shillings thus\r\ngenerously bestowed on the dependant, a proportionate _vacuum_ is\r\nmade in the pocket of the manager, let him recollect, that it is\r\na first and immutable principle of civil policy, that _the convenience\r\nof the few must yield to the accommodation of the many_; and, that\r\nthe noble Marquis, as a peer and legislator of Great Britain,\r\nis too closely attached to our excellent constitution to swerve\r\nfrom so old and established a maxim.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the last line of the couplet,\r\n\r\n  \"Not now in alehouse signs his face be shewn,\"\r\n\r\nwe must confess that our author's imagination has here been rather\r\ntoo prurient.--His lordship's head does not, as far as we can learn,\r\nupon the most minute enquiry, _at present_, grace any alehouse\r\nwhatever--It was indeed for some little time displayed at HATFIELD in\r\nHERTS; but the words \"_Good entertainment within_,\" being written\r\nunder it, they were deemed by travellers so extremely unapposite, that\r\nto avoid further expence, LORD SALISBURY's head was taken down, and\r\n\"_The old bald face Stag_\" resumed its pristine station.\r\n\r\nYet, enraptured with his first idea, our author soon forgets his late\r\nreflection, and proceeds on the supposition of the noble lord having\r\nexercised his pruning knife upon SHAKESPEARE and JOHNSON, and the\r\nadvantages which would have been derived from it, some of which he\r\nthus beautifully describes:\r\n\r\n  To plays should RICHMOND then undaunted come,\r\n  Secured from listening to PAROLLES's drum:\r\n  Nor shouldst thou, CAMELFORD, the fool reprove,\r\n  Who lost a world to gain a wanton's love.\r\n  \"Give me a horse,\" CATHCART should ne'er annoy:\r\n  Nor thou, oh! PITT, behold the angry boy.\r\n\r\nThe last line but one of these,\r\n\r\n  Give me a horse, &c.\r\n\r\nseems to allude to a circumstance that occurred in America, where his\r\nlordship being on foot, and having to march nearly five miles over\r\na sandy plain in the heat of summer, fortunately discovered, tied to\r\nthe door of a house, a horse belonging to an officer of cavalry.\r\nHis lordship thinking that riding was pleasanter than walking,\r\nand probably also imagining that the owner might be better engaged,\r\njudged it expedient to avail himself of this steed, which thus so\r\nfortunately presented itself, and accordingly borrowed it. The\r\nsubsequent apology, however, which he made when the proprietor, rather\r\nout of humour at his unlooked-for pedestrian expedition, came up to\r\nreclaim his lost goods, was so extremely ample, that the most rigid\r\nasserter of the old fusty doctrines of _meum_ and _tuum_ cannot deny\r\nthat the dismounted cavalier had full compensation for any\r\ninconvenience that he might have experienced. And we must add, that\r\nevery delicacy of the noble lord on this subject ought now to\r\nterminate.\r\n\r\nWe shall conclude with an extract from some complimentary verses by\r\na noble secretary, who is himself both an AMATEUR and ARTISTE.--Were\r\nany thing wanting to our author's fame, this elegant testimony in his\r\nfavour must be decisive with every reader of taste.\r\n\r\n  Oh! mighty ROLLE, may long thy fame be known!\r\n  And long thy virtues in his verse be shewn!\r\n  When THURLOW's christian meekness, SYDNEY's sense,\r\n  When RICHMOND's valour, HOPETOWN's eloquence,\r\n  When HAWKESB'RY's patriotism neglected lie\r\n  Intomb'd with CHESTERFIELD's humanity,\r\n  When PRETTYMEN, sage guardian of PITT's youth,\r\n  Shall lose each claim to honesty and truth,\r\n  When each pure blush DUNDAS's cheek can boast,\r\n  With ARDEN's law and nose alike are lost,\r\n  When grateful ROBINSON shall be forgot,\r\n  And not a line be read of MAJOR SCOTT,\r\n  When PHIPPS no more shall listening crouds engage,\r\n  And HAMLET's jests be rased from memory's page,\r\n  When PITT each patriot's joy no more shall prove,\r\n  Nor from fond beauty catch the sigh of love,\r\n  When even thy sufferings, virtuous chief! shall fade,\r\n  And BASSET's horsewhip but appear a shade,\r\n  Thy sacred spirit shall effulgence shed\r\n  And raise to kindred fame the mighty dead:\r\n  Long ages shall admire thy matchless soul,\r\n  And children's children lisp the praise of ROLLE.\r\n\r\n                    *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n_NUMBER VII._\r\n\r\nIt now only remains for us to perform the last melancholy office\r\nto the dying drummer, and to do what little justice we can to the\r\nvery ingenious and striking manner in which our author closes at once\r\nhis prophecy and his life.\r\n\r\nIt is a trite observation, that the curious seldom hear any good\r\nof themselves; and all epic poets, who have sent their heroes to\r\nconjurors, have, with excellent morality, taught us, that they who\r\npry into futurity, too often anticipate affliction.--VIRGIL plainly\r\nintimates this lesson in the caution which he puts into the mouth\r\nof ANCHISES, when ÆNEAS enquires into the future destiny of the\r\nyounger MARCELLUS, whose premature death forms the pathetic subject\r\nof the concluding vision in the sixth book of the ÆNEID:\r\n\r\n  \"O nate, ingentum lectum ne quære tuorum.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Seek not to know (the ghost replied with tears)\r\n  The sorrows of thy sons in future years.\"\r\n                                                     DRYDEN.\r\n\r\nThen, instead of declining any further answer, he very unnecessarily\r\nproceeds to make his son as miserable as he can, by detailing all\r\nthe circumstances best calculated to create the most tender\r\ninterest.--The revelation of disagreeable events to come, is by our\r\npoet more naturally put into the mouth of an enemy.--After running over\r\nmany more noble names than the records of the herald's office afford\r\nus any assistance in tracing, the second sighted Saxon, in the midst\r\nof his dying convulsions, suddenly bursts into a violent explosion\r\nof laughter.--This, of course, excites the curiosity of ROLLO, as it\r\nprobably will that of our readers; upon which the drummer insults\r\nhis conqueror with rather a long but very lively recital of all\r\nthe numerous disappointments and mortifications with which he foresees\r\nthat the destinies will affect the virtues of ROLLO's great\r\ndescendant, the present illustrious member for Devonshire. He mentions\r\nMr. ROLLE's many unsuccessful attempts to obtain the honour of the\r\npeerage; alludes to some of the little splenetive escapes into which\r\neven his elevated magnanimity is well known to have been for a moment\r\nbetrayed on those trying occasions. We now see all the drift and\r\nartifice of the poet, and why he thought the occasion worthy of making\r\nthe drummer so preternaturally long winded, in displaying at full all\r\nthe glories of the house of peers; it was to heighten by contrast the\r\nchagrin of ROLLO at finding the doors of this august assembly for ever\r\nbarred against his posterity.\r\n\r\nTo understand the introductory lines of the following passage, it is\r\nnecessary to inform our readers, if they are not already acquainted\r\nwith the fact, that somewhere in the back settlements of America,\r\nthere is now actually existing an illegitimate batch of little\r\nROLLE's.\r\n\r\n  Though wide should spread thy spurious race around,\r\n  In other worlds, which must not yet be found,\r\n  While they with savages in forests roam\r\n  Deserted, far from their paternal home;\r\n  A mightier savage in thy wilds EX-MOOR,\r\n  Their well-born brother shall his fate deplore,\r\n  By friends neglected, as by foes abhorr'd,\r\n  No duke, no marquis, not a simple lord.\r\n  Tho' thick as MARGARET's knights with each address,\r\n  New peers, on peers, in crouds each other press,\r\n  He only finds, of all the friends of PITT,\r\n  His luckless head no coronet will fit.\r\n\r\nBut what our author seems more particularly to have laboured, is a\r\npassage which he has lately inserted: it relates to the cruel slight\r\nwhich was shewn to Mr. ROLLE during the late royal progress through\r\nthe west.--Who is there that remembers the awful period when the\r\nregency was in suspence, but must at the same time remember the\r\npatriotic, decent, and consistent conduct of Mr. ROLLE? How laudably,\r\nin his parliamentary speeches, did he co-operate to the best of his\r\npower, with the popular pamphlets of the worthy Dr. WITHERS! How nobly\r\ndid he display his steady loyalty to the father, while he endeavoured\r\nto shake the future right of the son to the throne of his ancestors!\r\nHow brightly did he manifest his attachment to the person of his\r\nMAJESTY, by voting to seclude him in the hour of sickness from the\r\ntoo distressing presence of his royal brothers and his children; and,\r\nafter all, when he could no longer resist the title of the heir\r\napparent, with what unembarrassed grace did he agree to the address of\r\nhis constituents, complimenting the prince on his accession to that\r\nhigh charge, _to which his_ SITUATION and VIRTUES _so eminently_\r\nENTITLED _him:_ yet, even then, with how peculiar a dexterity did Mr.\r\nROLLE mingle what some would have thought an affront, with his\r\npraises, directly informing his ROYAL HIGHNESS that he had no\r\nconfidence whatever in any virtues but those of the minister. But,\r\nalas, how uncertain is the reward of all sublunary merit! Those good\r\njudges who inquired into the literary labours of the pious and\r\ncharitable Dr. WITHERS, did not exalt him to that conspicuous post,\r\nwhich he so justly deserved, and would so well have graced; neither\r\ndid one ray of royal favour cheer the loyalty of Mr. ROLLE during\r\nhis majesty's visit to DEVONSHIRE; though with an unexampled\r\nliberality, the worthy member had contracted for the fragments of Lord\r\nMOUNT EDGECUMBE's desert, and the ruins of his triumphal arches; had\r\nbrought down several of the minister's young friends to personate\r\nvirgins in white, sing, and strew flowers along the way; and had\r\nactually dispatched a chaise and four to Exeter, for his old friend\r\nand instructor, _mynheer_ HOPPINGEN VAN CAPERHAGEN, dancing-master and\r\npoet; who had promised to prepare both the _balets_ and _ballads_ for\r\nthis glorious festivity. And for whom was Mr. ROLLE neglected? For his\r\ncolleague, Mr. BASTARD; a gentleman who, in his political\r\noscillations, has of late vibrated much more frequently to the\r\nopposition than to the treasury bench. This most unaccountable\r\npreference we are certain must be matter of deep regret to all our\r\nreaders of sensibility;--to the drummer it is matter of exultation.\r\n\r\n  In vain with such bold spirit shall he speak,\r\n  That furious WITHERS shall to him seem meek;\r\n  In vain for party urge his country's fate;\r\n  To save the church, in vain distract the state;\r\n  In loyal duty to the father shewn,\r\n  Doubt the son's title to his future throne;\r\n  And from the suffering monarch's couch remove\r\n  All care fraternal, and all filial love:\r\n  Then when mankind in choral praise unite,\r\n  Though blind before, see virtues beaming bright;\r\n  Yet feigning to confide, distrust evince,\r\n  And while he flatters, dare insult his PRINCE.\r\n  Vain claims!--when now, the people's sins transferred\r\n  On their own heads, mad riot is the word;\r\n  When through the west in gracious progress goes\r\n  The monarch, happy victor of his woes;\r\n  While Royal smiles gild every cottage wall,\r\n  _Hope never comes to_ ROLLE, _that comes to all_;\r\n  And more with envy to disturb his breast,\r\n  BASTARD's glad roof receives the Royal guest.\r\n\r\nHere the drummer, exhausted with this last wonderful exertion,\r\nbegins to find his pangs increase fast upon him; and what follows,\r\nfor two and thirty lines, is all interrupted with different\r\ninterjections of laughter and pain, till the last line, which consists\r\nentirely of such interjections.--Our readers may probably recollect\r\nthe well-known line of THOMPSON.\r\n\r\n  \"OH, SOPHONISBA, SOPHONISBA, OH!\"\r\n\r\nWhich, by the way, is but a poor plagiarism from SHAKESPEARE:\r\n\r\n  \"OH, DESDEMONA, DESDEMONA, OH!\"\r\n\r\nThere is certainly in this line a very pretty change rung in the\r\ndifferent ways of arranging the name and the interjection; but perhaps\r\nthere may be greater merit, though of another kind, in the sudden\r\nchange of passions which OTWAY has expressed in the dying interjection\r\nof PIERRE:\r\n\r\n  \"We have deceiv'd the senate--ha! ha! oh!\"\r\n\r\nThese modern instances, however, fall very short of the admirable\r\nuse made of interjections by the ancients, especially the GREEKS,\r\nwho did not scruple to put together whole lines of them.--Thus in\r\nthe PHILOCTETES of SOPHOCLES, besides a great number of hemistics,\r\nwe find a verse and a half:\r\n\r\n                  {\"----------Papai.\r\n  Papa, papa, papa, papa, papa papai.\"}\r\n\r\nThe harsh and intractable genius of our language will not permit us\r\nto give any adequate idea of the soft, sweet, and innocent sound\r\nof the original.--It may, however, be faithfully, though coarsely,\r\ntranslated\r\n\r\n                            \"------Alas!\r\n  Alack! alack! alack! alack! alack! alas!\"\r\n\r\nAt the same time, we have -our doubts whether some chastised tastes\r\nmay not prefer the simplicity of ARISTOPHANES; though it must not\r\nbe concealed, that there are critics who think he meant a wicked\r\nstroke of ridicule at the PHILOCTETES of SOPHOCLES, when, in his\r\nown PLUTUS, he makes his sycophant, at the smell of roast meat,\r\nexclaim--\r\n\r\n  {\"Yy, yy, yy, yy, yy, yy!\"}\r\n\r\nWhich we shall render by an excellent interjection, first coined\r\nfrom the rich mint of MAJOR JOHN SCOTT, in his incomparable Ode--\r\n\r\n  \"Sniff, sniff, sniff, sniff, sniff, sniff, sniff, sniff, sniff,\r\n                                                                sniff,\r\n         sniff, sniff.\"\r\n\r\nBut whatever may be the comparative merits of these passages, ancient\r\nand modern, we are confident no future critic will dispute but that\r\nthey are all excelled by the following exquisite couplet of our\r\nauthor:\r\n\r\n  Ha! ha!--this soothes me in severest woe;\r\n  Ho! ho!--ah! ah!--oh! oh!--ha! ah!--ho!--oh!!!\r\n\r\nWe have now seen the drummer quietly inurn'd, and sung our requiem\r\nover his grave: we hope, however, that\r\n\r\n  ----He, dead corse, may yet, in complete calf,\r\n  Revisit oft the glimpses of the candle,\r\n  Making night chearful.\r\n\r\nWe had flattered ourselves with the hope of concluding the criticisms\r\non the ROLLIAD with an ode of Mr. ROLLE himself, written in the\r\noriginal EX-MOOR dialect; but we have hitherto, owing to the eagerness\r\nwith which that gentleman's literary labours are sought after,\r\nunfortunately been unable to procure a copy. The learned Mr. DAINES\r\nBARRINGTON having, however, kindly hinted to us, that he thought\r\nhe had once heard Sir JOHN HAWKINS say, that he believed there was\r\nsomething applicable to a drum in the possession of Mr. STEVENS,\r\nthe erudite annotator on SHAKESPEARE, Sir JOSEPH BANKS kindly wrote\r\nto that gentleman; who, upon searching into his manuscripts at\r\nHampstead, found the following epitaph, which is clearly designed\r\nfor our drummer. Mr. STEVENS was so good as to accompany his kind\r\nand invaluable communication with a dissertation to prove that this\r\nFRANCIS of GLASTONBURY, from similarity of style and orthography,\r\nmust have been the author of the epitaph which declares that\r\ncelebrated outlaw, ROBIN HOOD, to have been a British peer. Mr. PEGGE\r\ntoo informs us, that the HARLEIAN MISCELLANY will be found to confirm\r\nthis idea; and at the same time suggests, whether, as that dignified\r\ncharacter, Mr. WARREN HASTINGS, has declared himself to be descended\r\nfrom an Earl of HUNTINGDON, and the late Earl and his family have,\r\nthrough some unaccountable fantasy, as constantly declined the honour\r\nof the affinity, this apparent difference of opinion may not be\r\naccounted for by supposing him to be descended from _that_ Earl?--But,\r\nif we are to imagine any descendants of that exalted character to be\r\nstill in existence, with great deference to Mr. PEGGE's better\r\njudgment, might not Sir ALEXANDER HOOD, and his noble brother, from\r\nsimilarity of name, appear more likely to be descendants of this\r\ncelebrated archer? and from him also inherit that skill which the\r\ngallant admiral, on a never to be forgotten occasion, so eminently\r\ndisplayed in drawing a _long bow?_ We can only now lament, that we\r\nhave not room for any minute enquiry into these various hypotheses,\r\nand that we are under the necessity of proceeding to the drummer's\r\nepitaph, and the conclusion of our criticisms.\r\n\r\n[Blackletter:\r\n    \"A stalwart Saxon here doth lie,\r\n    Japeth nat, men of Normandie;\r\n    Rollo nought scoft his dyand wordes\r\n    Of poynt mo perrand than a swordis.\r\n    And leal folk of Englelonde\r\n    Shall haven hem yvir mo in honde.\r\n    Bot syn that in his life I trowe,\r\n    Of shepes skynnes he had ynowe,\r\n    For yvir he drommed thereupon:\r\n    Now he, pardie, is dede and gone,\r\n    May no man chese a shepis skynne\r\n    To wrappe his dyand wordes inne.\"\r\n             Od.

The Subject of Mr. ROSE's\r\nCOMPLAINT is, that he is left to do the whole Business of the Treasury\r\nduring the broiling Heats of Summer, while his Colleague, Mr. STEELE,\r\nenjoys the cool Breezes from the Sea, with Mr. PITT, at\r\nBrighthelmstone. In this the Scholar has improved on the Original of\r\nhis great Master, as the Cause of the Distress which he relates is\r\nmuch more natural. This Eclogue, from some internal Evidence, we\r\nbelieve to have been written in the Summer of 1785, though there may\r\nbe one or two Allusions that have been inserted at a later Period.\r\n\r\n  None more than ROSE, amid the courtly ring,\r\n  Lov'd BILLY, joy of JENKY and the KING.\r\n  But vain his hope to shine in BILLY's eyes;\r\n  Vain all his votes, his speeches, and his lies.\r\n  STEELE's happier claims the boy's regard engage;           5\r\n  Alike their studies, nor unlike their age:\r\n  With STEELE, companion of his vacant hours,\r\n  Oft would he seek Brighthelmstone's sea-girt tow'rs;\r\n  For STEELE, relinquish Beauty's trifling talk,\r\n  With STEELE each morning ride, each evening walk;         10\r\n  Or in full tea-cups drowning cares of state,\r\n  On gentler topics urge the mock debate;\r\n  On coffee now the previous question move;\r\n  Now rise a surplusage of cream to prove;\r\n  Pass muffins in Committees of Supply,                     15\r\n  And \"butter'd toast\" amend by adding \"dry:\"\r\n  Then gravely sage, as in St. Stephen's scenes,\r\n  With grief more true, propose the Ways and Means;\r\n  Or wanting these, unanimous of will,\r\n  They negative the leave to bring a bill.                  20\r\n    In one sad joy all ROSE's comfort lay;\r\n  Pensive he sought the treasury day by day;\r\n  There, in his inmost chamber lock'd alone,\r\n  To boxes red and green he pour'd his moan\r\n  In rhymes uncouth; for Rose, to business bred             25\r\n  A purser's clerk, in rhyme was little read;\r\n  Nor, since his learning with his fortunes grew,\r\n  Had such vain arts engaged his sober view;\r\n  For STOCKDALE's shelves contented to compose\r\n  The humbler poetry of lying prose.                        30\r\n    O barb'rous BILLY! (thus would he begin)\r\n  ROSE and his lies you value not a pin;\r\n  Yet to compassion callous as a Turk,\r\n  You kill me, cruel, with eternal work.\r\n  Now, after six long months of nothing done,               35\r\n  Each to his home, our youthful statesmen run;\r\n  The mongrel 'squires, whose votes our Treasury pays,\r\n  Now, with their hunters, till the winter graze;\r\n  Now e'en the reptiles of the Blue and Buff,\r\n  In rural leisure, scrawl their factious stuff;            40\r\n  Already pious HILL, with timely cares,\r\n  New songs, new hymns, for harvest-home prepares:\r\n  But with the love-lorne beauties, whom I mark\r\n  Thin and more thin, parading in the park,\r\n  I yet remain; and ply my busy feet                        45\r\n  From _Duke-street_ hither, hence to _Downing-street_,\r\n  In vain!--while far from this deserted scene,\r\n  With happier STEELE you saunter on the Steine.\r\n    And for a paltry salary, stript of fees,\r\n  Thus shall I toil, while others live at ease?             50\r\n  Better, another summer long, obey\r\n  Self-weening LANSDOWNE's transitory sway:\r\n  Tho' GRAFTON call'd him proud, I found him kind;\r\n  With me he puzzled, and with him I din'd.\r\n  Better with FOX in opposition share,                      55\r\n  Black tho' he be, and tho' my BILLY fair.\r\n  Think, BILLY, think JOHN BULL a tasteless brute,\r\n  By black, or fair, decides not the dispute:\r\n  Ah! think, how politics resemble chess;\r\n  Tho' now the white exult in short success,                60\r\n  One erring move a sad reverse may bring,\r\n  The black may triumph, and check-mate our king.\r\n    You slight me, BILLY; and but little heed,\r\n  What talents I possess, what merits plead;\r\n  How in white lies abounds my fertile brain;               65\r\n  And with what forgeries I those lies sustain.\r\n  A thousand fictions wander in my mind;\r\n  With me all seasons ready forgeries find.\r\n  I know the charm by ROBINSON employed,\r\n  How to the Treas'ry JACK his rats decoy'd.                70\r\n  Not wit, but malice, PRETTYMAN reveals,\r\n  When to my head he argues from my heels.\r\n  My skull is not so thick; but last recess\r\n  I finish'd a whole pamphlet for the press;\r\n  And if by some seditious scribbler maul'd,                75\r\n  The pen of CHALMERS to my aid I call'd,\r\n  With PRETTY would I write, tho' judg'd by you;\r\n  If all that authors think themselves be true.\r\n    O! to the smoky town would BILLY come;\r\n  With me draw estimates, or cast a sum;                    80\r\n  Pore on the papers which these trunks contain,\r\n  Then with red tape in bundles tie again;\r\n  Chaste tho' he be, if BILLY cannot sing,\r\n  Yet should he play to captivate the KING.\r\n    Beneath two Monarchs of the Brunswick line,             85\r\n  In wealth to flourish, and in arms to shine,\r\n  Was Britain's boast; 'till GEORGE THE THIRD arose,\r\n  In arts to gain his triumphs o'er our foes.\r\n  From RAMSAY's pallet, and from WHITEHEAD's lyre,\r\n  He sought renown that ages may admire:                    90\r\n  And RAMSAY gone, the honours of a name\r\n  To REYNOLDS gives, but trusts to WEST for fame:\r\n  For he alone, with subtler judgment blest,\r\n  Shall teach the world how REYNOLDS yields to WEST.\r\n  He too, by merit measuring the meed,                      95\r\n  Bids WARTON now to WHITEHEAD's bays succeed;\r\n  But, to reward FAUQUIER's illustrious toils,\r\n  Reserves the richer half of WHITEHEAD's spoils.\r\n  For well the monarch saw with prescient eye,\r\n  That WARTON's wants kind OXFORD would supply,            100\r\n  Who, justly liberal to the task uncouth,\r\n  Learns from St. JAMES's hard historic truth.\r\n    Blest OXFORD!

This work of the Honourable Secretary's was eminently\r\ndistinguished by a gentleman-like contempt for the pedantry of\r\ngrammar, and a poetical abhorrence of dull fact.\r\n\r\nVer. 42. For a long account of Sir Richard Hill's harvest-home,\r\nand of the godly hymns and ungodly ballads, sung on the occasion,\r\nsee the newspapers in Autumn, 1784.\r\n\r\nVer. 49. Justice to the minister obliges us to observe, that he is\r\nby no means chargeable with the scandalous illiberality above\r\nintimated, of reducing the income of the Secretaries of the Treasury\r\nto the miserable pittance of 3000l. a year. This was one of the many\r\ninfamous acts which to deservedly drew down the hatred of all\r\ntrue friends to their king and country, on those pretended patriots,\r\nthe Whigs.\r\n\r\nVer. 66. We know not of what forgeries Mr. Rose here boasts.\r\nPerhaps he may mean the paper relative to his interview with\r\nMr. Gibbon and Mr. Reynolds, so opportunely found in an obscure\r\ndrawer of Mr. Pitt's bureau. See the Parliamentary debates of 1785.\r\n\r\nVer. 71. Alludes to a couplet in the LYARS, which was written before\r\nthe present Eclogue.\r\n\r\nVer. 78. The _Reply to the Treasury Pamphlet_ was answered, not by\r\nMr. Rote himself, but by Mr. George Chalmers.\r\n\r\nVer. 88. The following digression on his Majesty's love of the\r\nfine arts, though it be somewhat long, will carry its apology with\r\nit in the truth and beauty of the panegyric. The judicious reader\r\nwill observe that the style is more elevated, like the subject,\r\nand for this the poet may plead both the example and precept of\r\nhis favourite Virgil.\r\n\r\n  --------sylvæ sint Consule dignæ.\r\n\r\nVer. 91 and 92. Since the death of Ramsay, Sir Joshua Reynolds\r\nis _nominally_ painter to the king, though his Majesty sits only\r\nto Mr. West.\r\n\r\nVer. 93. This line affords a striking instance of our Poet's\r\ndexterity in the use of his classical learning. He here translates\r\na single phrase from Horace.\r\n\r\n  _Judicium subtile_ videndis artibus illud.\r\n\r\nWhen he could not possibly apply what concludes,\r\n\r\n  Boetum in crasso jurares æere natum.\r\n\r\nVer. 95. Our most gracious Sovereign's comparative estimate of Messrs.\r\nWhitehead and Warton, is here happily elucidated, from a circumstance\r\nhighly honourable to his Majesty's taste; that, whereas he thought\r\nthe former worthy of two places, he has given the latter only the\r\nworst of the two. Mr. Fauquier is made Secretary and Register to the\r\norder of the Bath, in the room of the deceased Laureat.\r\n\r\nVer. 107. We suspect the whole of this passage in praise of his\r\nMajesty, has been retouched by Mr. Warton, as this line, or something\r\nvery like it, occurs in his \"Triumphs of Isis,\" a spirited poem, which\r\nis omitted, we know not why, in his publication of his works.\r\n\r\nVer. 149. Our readers, we trust, have already admired the several\r\nadditions which our poet has made to the ideas of his great original.\r\nHe has here given an equal proof of his judgment in a slight omission.\r\nWhen he converted Amyntas into Lord Uxbridge, with what striking\r\npropriety did he sink upon us the epithet of _stultus_, or _foolish_;\r\nfor surely we cannot suppose that to be conveyed above in the term\r\nof _simple_ peer.\r\n\r\nVer. 156. In the manuscript we find two lines which were struck out;\r\npossibly because our poet supposed they touched on a topic of praise,\r\nnot likely ta be very prevalent with Mr. PITT, notwithstanding what\r\nwe have lately heard of his \"Atlantean shoulders.\" They are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  Yet strong beyond the promise of their years,\r\n  Each in one night would drain two grenadiers.\r\n\r\nVer. 181. The orders of the Board of Controul, relative to the debts\r\nof the Nabob of Arcot, certainly _appear_ diametrically opposite to\r\nMr. Dundas's Reports, and to an express clause of Mr. Pitt's bill.\r\nOur author, however, like Mr. Pitt and Mr. Dundas, roundly asserts\r\nthe consistency of the whole.\r\n\r\nVer. 189. This unfortunate slip of the Honourable Secretary's\r\nconstitutional logic happened in a debate on the Irish Propositions.\r\nAmong the many wild chimeras of faction on that memorable occasion,\r\none objection was, that the produce of the French West-Indian Islands\r\nmight be legally smuggled through Ireland into this country. To which\r\nMr. Rose replied, \"That we might repeal all our acts in perfect\r\nsecurity, because the French King had lately issued an arrêt which\r\nwould prevent this smuggling.\"\r\n\r\nVer. 216. We flattered ourselves that this line might have enabled us\r\nto ascertain the precise time when this eclogue was written. We were,\r\nhowever, disappointed, as on examining the file of Morning Posts\r\nfor 1784, we could not find a single week in which Mr. FOX is\r\nabsolutely without some attack or other. We suppose therefore\r\nour author here speaks with the allowed latitude of poetry.\r\n\r\n                    *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nTHE LYARS.\r\n\r\nARGUMENT.\r\n\r\nThis Eclogue is principally an Imitation of the third Bucolic of\r\nVirgil, which, as is observed by Dr. Joseph Warton, the Brother of our\r\nincomparable Laureat, is of that Species called Amoeboea, where the\r\nCharacters introduced contend in alternate Verse; the second always\r\nendeavouring to surpass the first Speaker in an equal number of Lines,\r\nAs this was in point of Time the first of our Author's Pastoral\r\nAttempts, he has taken rather more Latitude than he afterwards allowed\r\nhimself in the rest, and has interspersed one or two occasional\r\nImitations from other Eclogues of the Roman Poet.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In Downing-street, the breakfast duly set,\r\n  As BANKS and PRETTYMAN one morn were met,\r\n  A strife arising who could best supply,\r\n  In urgent cases, a convenient lie;\r\n  His skill superior each essay'd to prove                   5\r\n  In verse alternate--which the Muses love!\r\n  While BILLY, listening to their tuneful plea,\r\n  In silence sipp'd his _Commutation_ Tea,\r\n  And heard them boast, how loudly both had ly'd:\r\n  The Priest began, the Layman thus reply'd!                10\r\n\r\nPRETTYMAN.\r\n  Why wilt thou, BANKS, with me dispute the prize?\r\n  Who is not cheated when a Parson lies?\r\n  Since pious Christians, ev'ry Sabbath-day,\r\n  Must needs believe whate'er the Clergy say!\r\n  In spite of all you Laity can do,                         15\r\n  One lie from us is more than ten from you!\r\n\r\nBANKS.\r\n  O witless lout! in lies that touch the state,\r\n  We, Country Gentlemen, have far more weight;\r\n  Fiction from us the public still must gull:\r\n  They think we're honest, as they know we're dull!         20\r\n\r\nPRETTYMAN.\r\n  In yon Cathedral I a Prebend boast,\r\n  The maiden bounty of our gracious host!\r\n  Its yearly profits I to thee resign,\r\n  If PITT pronounce not that the palm is mine!\r\n\r\nBANKS.\r\n  A Borough mine, a pledge far dearer sure,                 25\r\n  Which in St Stephen's gives a seat secure!\r\n  If PITT to PRETTYMAN the prize decree,\r\n  Henceforth CORFE-CASTLE shall belong to thee!\r\n\r\nPITT.\r\n  Begin the strain--while in our easy chairs\r\n  We loll, forgetful of all public cares!                   30\r\n  Begin the strain--nor shall I deem my time\r\n  Mispent, in hearing a debate in ryhme!\r\n\r\nPRETTYMAN.\r\n  Father of lies!

Our poet here seems to deviate from his general rule, by the\r\nintroduction of a phrase which appears rather adapted to the lower\r\nand less elevated strain of pastoral, than to the dialogue of persons\r\nof such distinguished rank. It is, however, to be considered, that it\r\nis far from exceeding the bounds of possibility to suppose, that,\r\nin certain instances, the epithet of \"Witless,\" and the coarse\r\ndesignation of \"Lout,\" may be as applicable to a dignitary of the\r\nchurch, as to the most ignorant and illiterate rustic.\r\n\r\nVer. 62. The truth of this line must be felt by all who have read\r\nthe lyrical effusions of Mr. Warton's competitors, whose odes were\r\nsome time since published, by Sir John Hawkins, Knight. The present\r\npassage must be understood in reference to these, and not to the\r\nLaureat's general talents.\r\n\r\nVer. 85. The ingenious and sagacious gentleman, who, at the period\r\nof the glorious revolution of 1784, held frequent meetings at\r\nthe Saint Alban's Tavern, for the purpose of bringing about an union\r\nthat might have prevented the dissolution of parliament; which\r\nmeetings afforded time to one of the members of the proposed union to\r\nconcert means throughout every part of the kingdom, for ensuring the\r\nsuccess of that salutary and constitutional measure, which, through\r\nhis friend Mr. B--ks, he had solemnly pledged himself not to adopt.\r\nHow truly does this conduct mark \"the statesman born!\"\r\n    -------- Dolus an virtus, quis in hoste requirit?\r\n\r\nVer. 98. It must be acknowledged that there is some obscurity in\r\nthis passage, as well as in the following line,\r\n\r\n    \"Which Asia's princes give, which Europe's take:\"\r\n\r\nand of this, certain seditious, malevolent, disaffected critics have\r\ntaken advantage, and have endeavoured, by a forced construction,\r\nto discover in them an unwarrantable insinuation against the highest\r\nand most sacred characters; from which infamous imputation, however,\r\nwe trust, the well-known and acknowledged loyalty of our author's\r\nprinciples will sufficiently protect him.\r\n\r\n                    *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n_MARGARET NICHOLSON._\r\n\r\nARGUMENT.\r\n\r\nMr. WILKES and Lord HAWKESBURY alternately congratulate each other\r\non his Majesty's late happy Escape, The one describes the Joy which\r\npervades the Country: the other sings the Dangers from which our\r\nConstitution has been preserved. Though in the following Eclogue\r\nour Author has not selected any single one of _Virgil_ for a close and\r\nexact Parody, he seems to have had his Eye principally upon the Vth,\r\nor the _Daphnis_, which contains the Elegy and _APOTHEOSIS_ of _Julius\r\nCæsar_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Session up: the INDIA-BENCH appeas'd,\r\n  The LANSDOWNES satisfied, the LOWTHERS pleas'd,\r\n  Each job dispatch'd:--the Treasury boys depart,\r\n  As various fancy prompts each youthful heart;\r\n  PITT, in chaste kisses seeking virtuous joy,               5\r\n  Begs Lady CHATHAM's blessing on her boy;\r\n  While MORNINGTON, as vicious as he can,\r\n  To fair R--L--N in vain affects the man:\r\n  With Lordly BUCKINGHAM retir'd at STOWE,\r\n  GRENVILLE, whose plodding brains no respite know,         10\r\n  To prove next year, how our finances thrive,\r\n  Schemes new reports, that two and two make five.\r\n  To plans of Eastern justice hies DUNDAS;\r\n  And comley VILLARS to his votive glass;\r\n  To embryo tax bills ROSE; to dalliance STEELE;            15\r\n  And hungry hirelings to their hard-earn'd meal.\r\n    A faithful pair, in mutual friendship tied,\r\n  Once keen in hate, as now in love allied\r\n  (This, o'er admiring mobs in triumph rode,\r\n  Libell'd his monarch and blasphem'd his God;              20\r\n  That, the mean drudge of tyranny and BUTE,\r\n  At once his practis'd pimp and prostitute),\r\n  Adscomb's proud roof receives, whose dark recess\r\n  And empty vaults, its owner's mind express,\r\n  While block'd-up windows to the world display             25\r\n  How much he loves a tax, how much invites the day.\r\n    Here the dire chance that god-like GEORGE befel,\r\n  How sick in spirit, yet in health how well;\r\n  What Mayors by dozens, at the tale affrighted,\r\n  Got drunk, address'd, got laugh'd at, and got knighted;   30\r\n  They read, with mingled horror and surprise,\r\n  In London's pure Gazette, that never lies.\r\n  Ye Tory bands, who, taught by conscious fears,\r\n  Have wisely check'd your tongues, and sav'd your ears,--\r\n  Hear, ere hard fate forbids--what heavenly strains        35\r\n  Flow'd from the lips of these melodious swains.\r\n  Alternate was the song; but first began,\r\n  With hands uplifted, the regenerate man.\r\n\r\nWILKES.\r\n  Bless'd be the beef-fed guard, whose vigorous twist\r\n  Wrench'd the rais'd weapon from the murderer's fist,      40\r\n  Him Lords in waiting shall with awe behold\r\n  In red tremendous, and hirsute in gold.\r\n    On him, great monarch, let thy bounty shine,\r\n  What meed can match a life so dear as thine?\r\n  Well was that bounty measured, all must own,              45\r\n  That gave him _half_ of what he saved--_a crown_.\r\n    Bless'd the dull edge, for treason's views unfit,\r\n  Harmless as SYDNEY's rage, or BEARCROFT's wit.\r\n  Blush, clumsy patriots, for degenerate zeal,\r\n  WILKES had not guided thus the faithless steel!

It is rearkable that these are the only lines which\r\nour Poet has imitated from the IVth Eclogue (or the Pollio) of Virgil.\r\nPerhaps the direct and obvious application of that whole Eclogue\r\nappeared to our author to be an undertaking too easy for the exercise\r\nof his superior talents; or perhaps he felt himself too well\r\nanticipated by a similar imitation of Pope's Messiah, which was\r\ninserted some time since in one of the public papers. If the author\r\nwill favour us with a corrected copy, adapted rather to the Pollio\r\nthan the Messiah, we shall be happy to give it a place in our\r\nsubsequent editions, of which we doubt not the good taste of the town\r\nwill demand as many as of the rest of our celebrated bard's\r\nimmortal compositions.\r\n\r\nVer. 119. The public alarm expressed upon the event which is the\r\nsubject of this Pastoral, was certainly a very proper token of\r\naffection to a Monarch, every action of whose reign denotes him\r\nto be the father of his people. Whether it has sufficiently subsided\r\nto admit of a calm enquiry into facts, is a matter of some doubt,\r\nas the addresses were not finished in some late Gazettes. If ever\r\nthat time should arrive, the world will be very well pleased to hear\r\nthat the miserable woman whom the Privy Council have judiciously\r\nconfined in Bedlam for her life, never even aimed a blow at his\r\nAugust Person.\r\n\r\nVer. 127. _This Book_, &c.

But we are\r\nto consider that _VIRGIL_ is revered by his Countrymen, not only\r\nas a Poet, but likewise as a Prophet and Magician; and our\r\nincomparable Translator, who was not ignorant of this Circumstance,\r\nwas convinced, that _VIRGIL_ in his _SILENUS_ had really and _bonâ\r\nfide_ meant to allude to the Wonders of the present Reign, and\r\nconsequently that it became his Duty to adhere most strictly to his\r\nOriginal, and to convey the true Meaning of this hitherto inexplicable\r\nEclogue.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Mine was the Muse, that from a Norman scroll\r\n  First rais'd to Fame the barbarous worth of ROLLE,\r\n  And dar'd on DEVON's hero to dispense\r\n  The gifts of Language, Poetry, and Sense.\r\n  In proud Pindarics next my skill I try'd,                  5\r\n  But SALISB'RY wav'd his wand and check'd my pride:\r\n  \"Write English, friend (he cry'd), be plain and flatter,\r\n  Nor thus confound your compliment and satire.\r\n  Even I, a critic by the King's command,\r\n  Find these here odes damn'd hard to understand.\"          10\r\n  Now then, O deathless theme of WARTON's Muse,\r\n  Oh great in War! oh glorious at Reviews!\r\n  While many a rival anxious for the bays;\r\n  Pursues thy virtues with relentless praise;\r\n  While at thy levee smiling crowds appear,                 15\r\n  Blest that thy birth-day happens once a year:\r\n  Like good SIR CECIL, I to woods retire,\r\n  And write plain eclogues o'er my parlour fire.\r\n  Yet still for thee my loyal verse shall flow,\r\n  Still, shou'd it please, to thee its charms shall owe;    20\r\n  And well I ween, to each succeeding age,\r\n  Thy name shall guard and consecrate my page.\r\n  Begin, my Muse!--As WILBERFORCE and BANKS\r\n  Late in the Lobby play'd their usual pranks,\r\n  Within a water-closet's niche immur'd                     25\r\n  (Oh that the treacherous door was unsecur'd),\r\n  His wig awry, his papers on the ground,\r\n  Drunk, and asleep, CHARLES JENKINSON they found.\r\n  Transported at the sight (for oft of late\r\n  At PITT's assembled on affairs of state,                  30\r\n  They both had press'd him, but could ne'er prevail,\r\n  To sing a merry song or tell a tale)\r\n  In rush'd th' advent'rous youths:--they seize, they bind,\r\n  Make fast his legs, and tie his hands behind,\r\n  Then scream for help; and instant to their aid            35\r\n  POMONA flies, POMONA, lovely maid;\r\n  Or maid, or goddess, sent us from above,\r\n  To bless young Senators with fruit and love.\r\n  Then thus the sage--\"Why these unseemly bands?\r\n  \"Untie my legs, dear boys, and loose my hands;            40\r\n  The promis'd tale be yours: a tale to you;\r\n  To fair POMONA different gifts are due.\"\r\n    Now all things haste to hear the master talk:\r\n  Here Fawns and Satyrs from the Bird-cage-walk,\r\n  Here Centaur KENYON, and the Sylvan sage,                 45\r\n  Whom BOWOOD guards to rule a purer age,\r\n  Here T------W, B------T, H------N appear,\r\n  With many a minor savage in their rear,\r\n  Panting for treasons, riots, gibbets, blocks,\r\n  To strangle NORTH, to scalp and eat CHARLES FOX.          50\r\n  There H------'s sober band in silence wait,\r\n  Inur'd to sleep, and patient of debate;\r\n  Firm in their ranks, each rooted to his chair\r\n  They sit, and wave their wooden heads in air.\r\n  Less mute the rocks while tuneful Phoebus sung,           55\r\n  Less sage the critic brutes round Orpheus hung;\r\n  For true and pleasant were the tales he told,\r\n  His theme great GEORGE's age, the age of gold.\r\n  Ere GEORGE appear'd a Briton bora and bred,\r\n  One general Chaos all the land o'erspread                 60\r\n  There lurking seeds of adverse factions lay,\r\n  Which warm'd and nurtur'd by his dawning ray,\r\n  Sprang into life.

Would to heaven\r\nthat the Bench of Bishops would, in some degree, adopt this\r\nexcellent idea!--or at least that the Dean and Chapter of Westminster,\r\nand the other Managers of the Abbey Music Meetings, would in future\r\nallot the occasional vacancies of Madame Mara's seat in the Cathedral\r\nOrchestra, for the reception of the reigning Laureat, during\r\nthe performance of that favourite constitutional ballad, \"May the King\r\nlive for ever!\" It must be owned, however, that the Laureatship is\r\nalready a very kingly settlement; one hundred a year, together with\r\na tierce of Canary, or a butt of sack, are surely most princely\r\nendowments, for the honour of literature and the advancement of\r\npoetical genius. And hence (thank God and the King for it!) there\r\nscarcely ever has been wanting some great and good man both willing\r\nand able to supply so important a charge.--At one time we find that\r\ngreat immortal genius, Mr. Thomas Shadwell (better known by the\r\nnames of Og and Mac Flecknoe), chanting the prerogative praises\r\nof that blessed æra.--At a nearer period, we observe the whole force\r\nof Colley Cibber's genius devoted to the labours of the same\r\nreputable employment.--And finally, in the example of a Whitehead's\r\nMuse, expatiating on the virtues of our gracious Sovereign, have we\r\nnot beheld the best of Poets, in the best of Verses, doing ample\r\njustice to the best of Kings!--The fire of Lyric Poesy, the rapid\r\nlightening of modern Pindarics, were equally required to record the\r\nVirtues of the Stuarts, or to immortalize the Talents of a\r\nBrunswick.--On either theme there was ample subject for the boldest\r\nflights of inventive genius, the full scope for the most daring powers\r\nof poetical creation; from the free, unfettered strain of liberty\r\nin honour of Charles the First, to the kindred Genius and congenial\r\nTalents that immortalize the Wisdom and the Worth of George the\r\nThird.--But on no occasion has the ardour for prerogative panegyrics so\r\nconspicuously flamed forth, as on the late election for succeeding\r\nto Mr. Whitehead's honours. To account for this unparalleled struggle,\r\nlet us recollect, that the ridiculous reforms of the late Parliament\r\nhaving cut off many gentlemanly offices, it was a necessary\r\nconsequence that the few which were spared, became objects of rather\r\nmore emulation than usual. Besides, there is a decency and regularity\r\nin producing at fixed and certain periods of the year, the same\r\nsettled quantity of metre on the same unalterable subjects, which\r\ncannot fail to give a particular attraction to the Office of the\r\nLaureatship, at a crisis like the present.--It is admitted, that we\r\nare now in possession of much sounder judgment, and more regulated\r\ntaste, than our ancestors had any idea of; and hence, does it not\r\nimmediately follow, that the occupancy of a poetical office, which,\r\nfrom its uniformity of subject and limitation of duty, precludes all\r\nhasty extravagance of style, as well as any plurality of efforts,\r\nis sure to be a more pleasing object than ever to gentlemen of\r\nregular habits and a becoming degree of literary indolence? Is it not\r\nevident too, that in compositions of this kind, all fermentation of\r\nthought is certain in a very short time to subside and settle into\r\nmild and gentle composition--till at length the possessors of this\r\ngrave and orderly office prepare their stipulated return of metre,\r\nby as proportionate and gradual exertions, as many other classes of\r\nindustrious tenants provide for the due payment of their particular\r\nrents? Surely it is not too much to say, that the business of Laureat\r\nto his Majesty is, under such provision, to the full as ingenious,\r\nreputable, and regular a trade, as that of Almanack Maker to the\r\nStationer's Company. The contest therefore for so excellent an office,\r\nhaving been warmer in the late instance than at any preceding period,\r\nis perfectly to be accounted for; especially too at a time, when,\r\nfrom nobler causes, the Soul of Genius may reasonably be supposed\r\nto kindle into uncommon enthusiasm, at a train of new and unexampled\r\nprodigies. In an age of Reform; beneath the mild sway of a British\r\nAugustus; under the Ministry of a pure immaculate youth; the Temple\r\nof Janus shut; the Trade of Otaheite open; not an angry American to\r\nbe heard of, except the Lottery Loyalists; the fine Arts in full\r\nGlory; Sir William Chambers the Royal Architect; Lord Sydney a Cabinet\r\nMinister!--What a golden æra!--From this auspicious moment, Peers,\r\nBishops, Baronets, Methodists, Members of Parliament, Chaplains,\r\nall genuine Beaux Esprits, all legitimate heirs of Parnassus,\r\nrush forward, with unfeigned ardour, to delight the world by the\r\nunited efforts of liberal genius and constitutional loyalty.--The\r\nillustrious candidates assemble--the wisest of Earls sits as Judge--the\r\narchest of Buffos becomes his assessor--the Odes are read--the election\r\nis determined--how justly is not for us to decide. To the great\r\nTribunal of the public the whole of this important contest is now\r\nsubmitted.--Every document that can illustrate, every testimony that\r\ntends to support the respective merits of the Probationers, is\r\nimpartially communicated to the world of letters.--Even the Editor of\r\nsuch a collection may hope for some reversionary fame from the humble,\r\nbut not inglorious task, of collecting the scattered rays of\r\nGenius.--At the eve of a long laborious life, devoted to a sister Muse\r\n(vide my History, printed for T. Payne and Son, at the Mews-Gate),\r\npossibly it may not wholly appear an irregular vanity, if I sometimes\r\nhave entertained a hope, that my tomb may not want the sympathetic\r\nrecord of Poetry--I avow my motive.--\r\n\r\nIt is with this expectation I appear as an Editor on the present\r\noccasion.--The Authors whose compositions I collect for public notice\r\nare twenty-three.

My grandfather had a M.S. Ode\r\non a Gilliflower, the which, as our family had it, was an _esquisse_\r\nof Gammer Gurton's; and I myself have seen various Cantilenes of\r\nStephen Duck's of a pure relish--Of Shadwell, time hath little\r\nimpaired the fame--Colley's Bays rust cankereth not--Dr. Casaubon\r\nmeasures the Strophe by Anapæsts--In the Polyglott, the epitrotus\r\nprimus is the metrimensura.--I venture to recommend \"Waly, waly,\r\nup the Bank,\" as no bad model of the pure Trochaic--There is also a\r\nlittle simple strain, commencing \"Saw ye my father, saw ye my mother;\"\r\nwhich to my fancy, gives an excellent ratio of hendecasyllables.--Dr.\r\nWarton indeed prefers the Adonic, as incomparably the neatest, ay, and\r\nthe newest {molpes metrhon}----A notion too has prevailed, that the\r\nBlack Joke, or {Melamphyllai Daphnai} is not the \"Cosa deta in prosa\r\nmai, ne in rima;\" whereas the _Deva Cestrensis_, or Chevy Chase,\r\naccording to Dr. Joseph Warton, is the exemplar of\r\n\r\n                        Trip and go,\r\n                        Heave and hoe,\r\n                        Up and down,\r\n                        To and fro.\r\n\r\nVide Nashe's Summer's Last Will and Testament, 1600.\r\n\r\nI observe that Ravishment is a favourite word with Milton, Paradise\r\nLost, B. V. 46. Again, B. IX. 541. Again, Com. V. 245.--Spenser has\r\nit also in Astrophel. st. 7.--Whereof I earnestly recommend early\r\nrising to all minor Poets, as far better than sleeping to concoct\r\nsurfeits. Vid. Apology for Smectymnuus.--For the listening to\r\nThrostles or Thrushes, awaking the _lustless_ Sun, is an unreproved\r\nor innocent pastime: As also are _cranks_, by which I understood\r\ncross purposes. Vid. my Milton, 41.--\"_Filling a wife with a daughter\r\nfair_,\" is not an unclassical notion (vid. my Milton, 39), if,\r\naccording to Sir Richard Brathwaite, \"She had a dimpled chin,\r\nmade for love to lodge within\" (vid. my Milton, 41). \"While the\r\n_cock_,\" vid. the same, 44.--Indeed, \"My mother said I could be no\r\n_lad_, till I was twentye,\" is a passage I notice in my Milton with a\r\nview to this; which see; and therein also of a shepherdess, \"_taking\r\nthe tale_.\"--'Twere well likewise if Bards learned the Rebeck,\r\nor Rebible, being a species of Fiddle; for it solaceth the fatigued\r\nspirit much; though to say the truth, we have it; 'tis present death\r\nfor Fiddlers to tune their Rebecks, or Rebibles, before the great\r\nTurk's grace. However, _Middteton's Game of Chess_ is good for a Poet\r\nto peruse, having quaint phrases fitting _to be married to immortal\r\nverse_. JOSHUA POOLE, of Clare-hall, I also recommend as an apt guide\r\nfor an alumnus of the Muse.--Joshua edited a choice Parnassus, 1657,\r\nin the which I find many \"delicious, mellow hangings\" of poesy.--He\r\nis undoubtedly a \"sonorous dactylist\"--and to him I add Mr. Jenner,\r\nProctor of the Commons, and Commissary of St. Paul's, who is a\r\ngentleman of indefatigable politeness in opening the Archives of a\r\nChapter-house for the delectation of a sound critic. _Tottell's Songs\r\nand Sonnets of uncertain Auctoures_ is likewise a _butful_, or\r\nplenteous work. I conclude with assuring the Public, that my brother\r\nremembers to have heard my father tell his (i.e. my brother's) first\r\nwife's second cousin, that he, once, at Magdalen College, Oxford, had\r\nit explained to him, that the famous passage \"His reasons are as two\r\ngrains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff,\" has no sort of reference\r\nto verbal criticism and stale quotations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATORY\r\nTESTIMONIES.\r\n\r\n[According to the old and laudable usage of Editors, we shall now\r\npresent our Readers with the judgments of the learned concerning\r\nour Poets.--These Testimonies, if they proceed from critical pens,\r\ncannot fail to have due influence on all impartial observers.\r\nThey _pass_ an author from one end of the kingdom to the other,\r\nas rapidly as the pauper Certificates of Magistracy.--Indeed,\r\nit were much to be wished, that as we have no State Licenser of\r\nPoetry, it might at least be made penal, to put forth rhymes without\r\npreviously producing a certain number of sureties for their goodness\r\nand utility; which precaution, if assisted with a few other\r\nregulations, such as requiring all Practitioners in Verse to take\r\nout a License, in the manner of many other Dealers in Spirits, &c.\r\ncould not fail to introduce good order among this class of authors,\r\nand also to bring in a handsome sum towards the aid of the public\r\nrevenue.--Happy indeed will be those Bards, who are supplied with\r\nas reputable vouchers as those which are here subjoined.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Testimonies of Sir_ JOSEPH MAWBEY'_s good Parts for Poetry_.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISS HANNAH MORE.\r\n\r\n\"Sir JOSEPH, with the gentlest sympathy, begged me to contrive\r\nthat he should meet _Lactilla_, in her morning walk, towards the\r\nHot-Wells.

I had that day parted with\r\nmy diamond windmill.--Life was never very dear to me--but a\r\nthousand thoughts then rushed into my heart, to jump this world,\r\nand spring into eternity.--I determined that my faithful Pompey\r\nshould bear me company.--I pressed him close, and actually stretched\r\nout, fully resolved to plunge into the stream; when, luckily\r\n(ought I to call it so?) that charming fellow (for such he then was),\r\nSir Cecil WRAY, catching hold of Pompey's tail, pulled him back,\r\nand with him pulled back me.--In a moment I found myself in a\r\nclean hackney-coach, drawn by grey horses, with a remarkable\r\ncivil coachman, fainting in my Cecil's arms; and though I then\r\nlost a little diamond pin, yet (contrary to what I hear has been\r\nasserted) I NEVER prosecuted that gallant Baronet; who, in less\r\nthan a fortnight after, with his usual wit and genius, dispatched me\r\nthe following extempore poem:\r\n\r\n  While you prepar'd, dear Anne, on Styx to sail--\r\n  Lo! one dog sav'd you by another's tail.\r\n\r\nTo which, in little more than a month, I penned, and sent the\r\nfollowing reply:\r\n\r\n  You pinch'd my dog, 'tis true, and check'd my sail--\r\n  But then my pin--ah, there you squeezed _my_ tail.\r\n\r\n              _Ninth volume of Mrs. George Anne Bellamy's Apology,\r\n                        now preparing for the press_.\r\n\r\n                    *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n_Testimony of the great Parts of_ CONSTANTINE, LORD MULGRAVE,\r\n_and his Brethren_.\r\n\r\nMR.

THOMAS WARTON'S ASCENSION\r\nFROM\r\nCHRIST-CHURCH MEADOW, OXFORD,\r\n\r\n(In the Balloon of James Sadler, Pastry-Cook to the said University)\r\non Friday the 20th of May, 1785, for the purpose of composing\r\na sublime ODE in honour of his Majesty's Birth-day; attested\r\nbefore JOHN WEYLAND, Esq. one of his Majesty's Justices of the Peace\r\nfor the County of Oxford.[1]\r\n\r\nIt was in obedience to the advice of my brother, Dr. Joseph Warton,\r\nthat I came to a determination, on the fifth of May ult. to compose\r\nmy first Birth-day Ode, at the elevation of one mile above the earth,\r\nin the Balloon of my ingenious friend, Mr. James Sadler, of this city.\r\nAccordingly, having agreed for the same, at a very moderate rate\r\nper hour (I paying all charges of inflating, and standing to repairs),\r\nat nine in the morning, on Friday, the 28th of said month, I repaired\r\nto Christ-church meadow, with my ballast, provisions, cat, speaking\r\ntrumpet, and other necessaries.--It was my first design to have\r\ninvited Dr. Joseph to have ascended with me; but apprehending the\r\nmalicious construction that might follow on this, as if, forsooth,\r\nmy intended ode was to be a joint production, I e'en made up my mind\r\nto mount alone.--My provisions principally consisted of a small pot\r\nof stewed prunes, and half of a plain diet-bread cake, both prepared,\r\nand kindly presented to me, by the same ingenious hand which had\r\nfabricated the Balloon. I had also a small subsidiary stock, viz.\r\na loaf of Sandwiches, three bottles of old ale, a pint of brandy,\r\na sallad ready mixed, a roll of collared eel, a cold goose, six\r\ndamson tartlets, a few china oranges, and a roasted pig of the\r\nChinese breed; together with a small light barometer, and a proper\r\nstore of writing utensils; but no note, memorandum, nor loose hint\r\nof any kind, so help me God!----My ascension was majestic, to an\r\nuncommon degree of tardiness. I was soon constrained, therefore,\r\nto lighten my Balloon, by throwing out some part of my ballast,\r\nwhich consisted of my own History of Poetry, my late edition of\r\nMilton's Minora, my Miscellaneous Verses, Odes, Sonnets, Elegies,\r\nInscriptions, Monodies, and Complaints; my Observations on Spencer,\r\nthe King's last Speech, and Lord Montmorres's pamphlet on the\r\nIrish Resolutions. On throwing out his Lordship's Essay, the Balloon\r\nsprang up surprisingly; but the weight of my provisions still\r\nretarding the elevation, I was fain to part with both volumes of\r\nmy Spencer, and all of my last edition of Poems, except those that\r\nare marked with an asterisk, as never before printed: which very\r\nquickly accelerated my ascension. I now found the barometer had\r\nfallen four inches and six lines, in eight minutes.--In less than\r\neleven minutes after I had ascended very considerably indeed,\r\nthe barometer having then fallen near seventeen inches; and presently\r\nafter I entered a thick black cloud, which I have since found\r\nrendered me wholly obscured to all observation. In this situation.\r\nI lost no time to begin my Ode; and, accordingly, in the course\r\nof twenty-five minutes, I produced the very lines which now commence\r\nit. The judicious critic will notice, that absence of the plain\r\nand trite style which mark the passage I refer to; nor am I so\r\nuncandid to deny the powerful efficacy of mist, darkness, and\r\nobscurity, on the sublime and mysterious topics I there touch on--It\r\ncannot fail also to strike the intelligent observer, that the\r\nexpression so much commented on, of \"_No echoing car_,\" was obviously\r\nsuggested by that very car in which I myself was then seated--Finding,\r\nhowever, that, together with the increased density of the\r\novershadowing cloud, the coldness also was proportionally increased,\r\nso as at one time to freeze my ink completely over for near twenty\r\nminutes, I thought it prudent, by means of opening the valve at the\r\nvortex of my Balloon, to emit part of the ascending power. This\r\noccasioned a proportioned descent very speedily: but I must not\r\noverlook a phænomenon which had previously occurred.----It was this:\r\non a sudden the nibs of all my pens (and I took up forty-eight, in\r\ncompliment to the number of my Sovereign's years) as if attracted by\r\nthe polar power, pointed upwards, each pen erecting itself\r\nperpendicular, and resting on the point of its feather: I found also,\r\nto my no small surprize, that during the whole of this period, every\r\none of my letters was actually cut topsy-turvy-wise; which I the\r\nrather mention, to account for any appearance of a correspondent\r\ninversion in the course of my ideas at that period.\r\n\r\nOn getting nearer the earth, the appearances I have described\r\naltogether ceased, and I instantly penned the second division of\r\nmy Ode; I mean that which states his most excellent Majesty to be\r\nthe patron of the fine arts. But here (for which I am totally at\r\na loss to account) I found myself descending so very rapidly, that\r\neven after I had thrown out not only two volumes of my History\r\nof Poetry, but also a considerable portion of my pig, I struck,\r\nnevertheless, with such violence on the weather-cock of a church,\r\nthat unless I had immediately parted with the remainder of my ballast,\r\nexcepting only his Majesty's Speech, one pen, the paper of my Ode,\r\nand a small ink-bottle, I must infallibly have been a-ground.\r\nFortunately, by so rapid a discharge, I procured a quick re-ascension;\r\nwhen immediately, though much pinched with the cold, the mercury\r\nhaving suddenly fallen twenty-two inches, I set about my concluding\r\nstanza, viz. that which treats of his Majesty's most excellent\r\nchastity. And here I lay my claim to the indulgence of the critics\r\nto that part of my ode; for what with the shock I had received\r\nin striking on the weather-cock, and the effect of the prunes\r\nwhich I had now nearly exhausted, on a sudden I found myself\r\nvery much disordered indeed. Candour required my just touching\r\non this circumstance; but delicacy must veil the particulars\r\nin eternal oblivion. At length, having completed the great object\r\nof my ascent, I now re-opened the valve, and descended with great\r\nrapidity. They only who have travelled in Balloons, can imagine\r\nthe sincere joy of my heart, at perceiving Dr. Joseph cantering up\r\na turnip-field, near Kidlington Common, where I landed exactly at\r\na quarter after two o'clock; having, from my first elevation,\r\ncompleted the period of five hours and fifteen minutes; four of\r\nwhich, with the fraction of ten seconds, were entirely devoted to\r\nmy Ode.--Dr. Joseph quite hugged me in his arms, and kindly lent me\r\na second wig (my own being thrown over at the time of my striking),\r\nwhich, with his usual precaution, he had brought in his pocket,\r\nin case of accidents. I take this occasion also to pay my thanks\r\nto Thomas Gore, Esq. for some excellent milk-punch, which he\r\ndirected his butler to furnish me with most opportunely; and which\r\nI then thought the most solacing beverage I ever had regaled withal.\r\nDr Joseph and myself reached Oxford in the Dilly by five in the\r\nevening, the populace most handsomely taking off the horses for\r\nsomething more than the last half mile, in honour of the first\r\nLiterary Areonaut of these kingdoms--\r\n\r\n    _As witness my hand this 22d of May, 1785_, THOMAS WARTON.\r\n\r\nCERTIFICATE.\r\n\r\n_County of Oxford to wit, 22nd of May, 1785._\r\nThis is to certify, to all whom it may concern, That the aforesaid\r\nThomas and Joseph Warton came before me, one of his Majesty's\r\nJustices of the Peace for the said county, and did solemnly make\r\noath to the truth of the above case.\r\n                                                   His\r\n                              Sworn before me, JOHN + WEYLAND.\r\n                                                  Mark.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] It cannot fail to attract the Reader's particular attention\r\nto this very curious piece, to inform him, that Signor Delpini's\r\ndecision, in favour of Mr. Warton, was chiefly grounded on the new\r\nand extraordinary style of writing herein attested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAUREAT ELECTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the demise of the late excellent Bard, William Whitehead, Esq.\r\nPoet Laureat to his Majesty, it was decidedly the opinion of\r\nhis Majesty's great superintendant Minister, that the said office\r\nshould be forthwith declared elective, and in future continue so;\r\nin order as well to provide the ablest successor on the present\r\nmelancholy occasion, as also to secure a due preference to superior\r\ntalents, upon all future vacancies: it was in consequence of this\r\ndetermination, that the following Public Notice issued from the\r\nLord Chamberlain's Office, and became the immediate cause of the\r\ncelebrated contest that is recorded in these pages.\r\n\r\n                    *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT.\r\n_Lord Chamberlain's Office, April 26._\r\n\r\nIn order to administer strict and impartial justice to the numerous\r\ncandidates for the vacant POET LAUREATSHIP, many of whom are of\r\nillustrious birth, and high character,\r\n\r\nNotice is hereby given, That the same form will be attended to\r\nin receiving the names of the said Candidates, which is invariably\r\nobserved in registering the Court Dancers. The list to be finally\r\nclosed on Friday evening next.\r\n\r\nEach Candidate is expected to deliver in a PROBATIONARY BIRTH-DAY ODE,\r\nwith his name, and also personally to appear on a future day, to\r\nrecite the same before such literary judges as the Lord Chamberlain,\r\nin his wisdom, may appoint.\r\n\r\n                    *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nLAUREAT ELECTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The following Account, though modestly stiled a _Hasty Sketch_,\r\naccording to the known delicacy of the Editorial Style, is in fact\r\n_A Report_, evidently penned by the hand of a Master.]\r\n\r\nHASTY SKETCH _of Wednesday's Business at the_ LORD CHAMBERLAIN'S\r\nOFFICE.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the late general notice, given by public\r\nadvertisement, of an _open election_ for the vacant office of _Poet\r\nLaureat_ to their Majesties, on the terms of Probationary\r\nCompositions, a considerable number of the most eminent characters in\r\nthe fashionable world assembled at the _Lord Chamberlain's Office_,\r\nStable-yard, St. James's, on Wednesday last, between the hours of\r\ntwelve and two, when Mr. _Ramus_ was immediately dispatched to Lord\r\nSalisbury's, acquainting his Lordship therewith, and soliciting his\r\nattendance to receive the several candidates, and admit their\r\nrespective tenders. His Lordship arriving in a short time after, the\r\nfollowing Noblemen and Gentlemen were immediately presented to his\r\nLordship by _John Calvert, Jun. Esq._ in quality of Secretary to the\r\noffice. _James Eley, Esq._ and Mr. _Samuel Betty_, attended also as\r\nfirst and second Clerk, the following list of candidates was made out\r\nforthwith, and duly entered on the roll, as a preliminary record to\r\nthe subsequent proceedings.\r\n\r\nThe Right Rev. Dr. William Markham, Lord Archbishop of York.\r\nThe Right Hon. Edward, Lord Thurlow, Lord High Chancellor of Great\r\n                                                              Britain.\r\nThe Most Noble James, Marquis of Graham.\r\nThe Right Hon. Harvey Redmond, Visc. Montmorres, of the kingdom of\r\n                                                              Ireland.\r\nThe Right Hon. Constantine, Lord Mulgrave, ditto.\r\nThe Right Hon. Henry Dundas.\r\nSir George Howard, K.B.\r\nSir Cecil Wray, Baronet.\r\nSir Joseph Mawbey, ditto.\r\nSir Richard Hill, ditto.\r\nSir Gregory Page Turner, ditto.\r\nThe Rev. William Mason, B.D.\r\nThe Rev. Thomas Warton, B.D.\r\nThe Rev. George Prettyman, D.D.\r\nThe Rev, Joseph Warton, D.D.\r\nPepper Arden, Esq. Attorney-General to his Majesty.\r\nMichael Angelo Taylor, Esq. M.P.\r\nJames M'Pherson, Esq. ditto.\r\nMajor John Scott, ditto.\r\nNath. William Wraxhall, Esq. ditto.\r\nMons. Le Mesurier, Membre du Parlement d'Angleterre.\r\n\r\nThe several candidates having taken their places at a table provided\r\nfor the occasion, the Lord Chamberlain, in the politest manner,\r\nsignified his wish that each candidate would forthwith recite some\r\nsample of his poetry as he came provided with for the occasion;\r\nat the same time most modestly confessing his own inexperience\r\nin all such matters, and intreating their acquiescence therefore\r\nin his appointment of his friend _Mr. Delpini_, of the Hay-Market\r\nTheatre, as an active and able assessor on so important an occasion.\r\nAccordingly, _Mr. Delpini_ being immediately introduced, the several\r\ncandidates proceeded to recite their compositions, according to\r\ntheir rank and precedence in the above list--both his Lordship and\r\nhis assessor attended throughout the whole of the readings with\r\nthe profoundest respect, and taking no refreshment whatsoever,\r\nexcept some China oranges and biscuit, which were also handed about\r\nto the company by _Mr. John Secker_, Clerk of the Houshold, and\r\n_Mr. William Wise_, Groom of the Buttery.\r\n\r\nAt half after five, the readings being completed, his Lordship and\r\n_Mr. Delpini_ retired to an adjoining chamber; _Mrs. Elizabeth Dyer_,\r\nKeeper of the Butter and Egg Office, and _Mr. John Hook_, Deliverer\r\nof Greens, being admitted to the candidates with several other\r\nrefreshments suitable to the fatigue of the day. Two Yeomen of\r\nthe Mouth and a Turn-broacher attended likewise; and indeed every\r\nexertion was made to conduct the little occasional repast that\r\nfollowed with the utmost decency and convenience; the whole being\r\nat the expence of the Crown, notwithstanding every effort to the\r\ncontrary on the part of _Mr. Gilbert_.\r\n\r\nAt length the awful moment arrived, when the _detur digniori_ was\r\nfinally to be pronounced on the busy labours of the day--never\r\ndid Lord Salisbury appear to greater advantage--never did his\r\nassessor more amusingly console the discomfitures of the failing\r\ncandidates--every thing that was affable, every thing that was\r\nmollifying, was ably expressed by both the judges; but poetical\r\nambition is not easily allayed. When the fatal _fiat_ was announced\r\nin favour of the Rev. Thomas Warton, a general gloom overspread\r\nthe whole society--a still and awful silence long prevailed.\r\nAt length Sir Cecil Wray started up, and emphatically pronounced\r\n_a scrutiny! a scrutiny!_--A shout of applause succeeded--in vain\r\ndid the incomparable Buffo introduce his most comic gestures--in\r\nvain was his admirable leg pointed horizontally at every head in\r\nthe room--a scrutiny was demanded--and a scrutiny was granted.\r\nIn a word, the Lord Chamberlain declared his readiness to submit\r\nthe productions of the day to the inspection of the public, reserving\r\nnevertheless to himself and his assessor, the full power of annulling\r\nor establishing the sentence already pronounced. It is in consequence\r\nof the above direction, that we shall now give the public the said\r\nPROBATIONARY VERSES, commencing with those, however, which are the\r\nproduction of such of the candidates as most vehemently insisted\r\non the right of appeal, conceiving such priority to be injustice\r\ngranted to the persons whose public spirit has given so lucky a\r\nturn to this poetical election. According to the above order, the\r\nfirst composition that we lay before the public is the following:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_NUMBER I._\r\n\r\nIRREGULAR ODE.\r\n\r\nThe WORDS by SIR CECIL WRAY, BART.\r\n\r\nThe SPELLING by Mr. GROJAN, _Attorney at Law._\r\n\r\n    HARK! hark!--hip! hip!--hoh! hoh!\r\n      What a mort of bards are a-singing!\r\n    Athwart--across--below----\r\n      I'm sure there's a dozen a dinging!\r\n    I hear sweet Shells, loud Harps, large Lyres--\r\n    Some, I trow, are tun'd by Squires--\r\n  Some by Priests, and some by Lords!--while Joe and I\r\n  Our _bloody hands_, hoist up, like meteors, on high!\r\n      Yes, _Joe_ and I\r\n      Are em'lous--Why?\r\n  It is because, great CÆSAR, you are clever--\r\n  Therefore we'd sing of you for ever!\r\n      Sing--sing--sing--sing\r\n      God save the King!\r\n    Smile then, CÆSAR, smile on _Wray_!\r\n    Crown at last his _poll_ with bay!----\r\n    Come, oh! bay, and with thee bring\r\n    Salary, illustrious thing!----\r\n    Laurels vain of Covent-garden,\r\n    I don't value you a farding!----\r\n      Let sack my soul cheer\r\n      For 'tis sick of small beer!\r\n  CÆSAR!

Thou\r\nart bold to confront disgrace, and shame is unknown to thy brow--but\r\ntender is the youth of thy leader; who droopeth his head like a faded\r\nlily--leave not _Pitto_ in the day of defeat, when the Chiefs of the\r\nCounties fly from him like the herd from the galled Deer.--The friends\r\nof _Pitto_ are fled. He is alone--he layeth himself down in despair,\r\nand sleep knitteth up his brow.--Soft were his dreams on the green\r\nbench--Lo! the spirit of _Jenky_ arose, pale as the mist of the\r\nmorn--twisted was his long lank form--his eyes winked as he whispered\r\nto the child in the cradle. Rise, he sayeth--arise bright babe of the\r\ndark closet! the shadow of the Throne shall cover thee, like wings of\r\na hen, sweet chicken of the Back-stair brood! Heed not the Thanes of\r\nthe Counties; they have fled from thee, like Cackling Geese from the\r\nhard-bitten Fox: but will they not rally and return to the charge? Let\r\nthe host of the King be numbered; they are as the sands of the barren\r\nshore.--There Is _Powno_, who followeth his mighty leader, and chaceth\r\nthe stall-fed stag all day on the dusty road.--There is _Howard_,\r\ngreat in arms, with the beaming star on his spreading breast.--Red is\r\nthe scarf that waves over his ample shoulders--Gigantic are his strides\r\non the terrace, in pursuit of the Royal footsteps of lofty _Georgio_.\r\n\r\nNo more will I number the flitting shades of Jenky; for behold the\r\npotent spirit of the black-browed _Jacko_.--'Tis the _Ratten Robinso_,\r\nwho worketh the works of darkness! Hither I come, said _Ratten_--Like\r\nthe mole of the earth, deep caverns have been my resting place;\r\nthe ground _Rats_ are my food.--Secret minion of the Crown, raise\r\nthy soul! Droop not at the spirit of _Foxan_. Great are thy foes\r\nin the sight of the many-tongued war.--Shake not they knees, like\r\nthe leaves of the Aspen on the misty hill--the doors of the stairs\r\nin the postern are locked; the voice of thy foes is as the wind,\r\nwhich whistleth through the vale; it passeth away like the swift\r\ncloud of the night.\r\n\r\nThe breath of _Gwelfo_ stilleth the stormy seas.----Whilst thou\r\nbreathest the breath of his nostrils, thou shalt live for ever.\r\nFirm standeth thy heel in the Hall of thy Lord. Mighty art thou in\r\nthe sight of _Gwelfo_, illustrious leader of the friends of _Gwelfo_!\r\ngreat art thou, O lovely imp of the interior closet! O lovely Guardian\r\nof the Royal Junto!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNUMBER VII.\r\n\r\nMR. MASON having laid aside the more noble subject for a Probationary\r\nOde, viz. the Parliamentary Reform, upon finding that the Rev.

However, for my own part, I am rather of opinion,\r\nthat this seeming mis-spelling arose from the Doctor's following\r\nthe same well-known circumspection which he exercised in the case\r\nof Mr. Wedgewood, and declining to give his Ode _under his hand_;\r\npreferring to repeat it to Mr. Delpini's Amanuensis, who very\r\nprobably may have committed that, and similar errors in orthography.\r\n\r\n[2] Winds its sly way, &c.] A line taken in great part from Milton.\r\nThe whole passage (which it may not be unpleasing to recall to\r\nthe recollection of the reader) has been closely imitated by\r\nmy friend Prettyman, in a former work.\r\n  \"I, under fair pretence of friendly ends,\r\n  And well-placed words of glozing courtesy,\r\n  Baited with reasons not unplausible,\r\n  _Wind me into the easy-hearted man,_\r\n  And hug him into snares.\"       COMUS.\r\n\r\n[3] Golden tone, &c.] The epithet may seem at first more proper\r\nfor the instrument, but it applies here with great propriety to\r\nthe sound. In the strictest-sense, what is golden sound but the sound\r\nof gold? and what could arise more naturally in the writer's mind\r\nupon the present occasion?\r\n\r\n[4] Phrenzy-rapt, &c.] Auditis? An me ludit amabilis\r\n                       Insania?----\r\n\r\n[5] By thee inspir'd, &c.] In the first manuscript:\r\n  \"While yet a cradled child, he conquer'd shame,\r\n  And lisp'd in fables, for the fables came.\"    See POPE.\r\n\r\n[6] Sin from his forehead sprung.]\r\n                \"A goddess armed\r\n      Out of thy head I sprung.\"\r\n                                   See MILTON's Birth of Sin.\r\n\r\n[7] The quick transition of persons must have struck the reader in the\r\nfirst part of this Ode, and it will be observable throughout: Now\r\nPoet, now Muse, now Chorus; then Spinner, Blacksmith, &c. &c. The\r\nDoctor, skips from point to point over Parnassus, with a nimbleness\r\nthat no modern imitator of Pindar ever equalled.--Catch him, even\r\nunder a momentary shape, who can. I was always an admirer of\r\ntergiversation (and as my flatterers might say), no bad practitioner;\r\nbut it remained for my friend to shew the sublimity to which the\r\nfigure lam alluding to (I do not know the learned name of it) might be\r\ncarried.\r\n\r\n[8] Wrinkle-twinkle, &c.] It must have been already observed by\r\nthe sagacious reader, that our author can coin an epithet as well\r\nas a fable. Wrinkles are as frequently produced by the motion of\r\nthe part as by the advance of age. The head of the distinguished\r\npersonage here described, though in the prime of his faculties,\r\nhe had more exercise in every sense than any head in the world.\r\nWhether he means any illusion to the worship of the rising sun,\r\nand imitates the Persian priests, whose grand act of devotion is\r\nto turn round; or whether he merely thinks that the working of\r\nthe head in circles will give analogous effect to the species\r\nof argument in which he excels, we must remain in the dark; but\r\ncertain it is, that whenever he reasons in public, the _capital_\r\nand wonderful part of the frame I am alluding to, is continually\r\nrevolving upon its axis: and his eyes, as if dazzled with rays\r\nthat dart on him exclusively, twinkle in their orbs at the rate\r\nof sixty twinks to one revolution. I trust I have given a rational\r\naccount, and not far-fetched, both of the wrinkle and twinkle in\r\nthis ingenious compound.\r\n\r\n[9] No rogue that goes, &c.] The candid reader will put no improper\r\ninterpretation on the word rogue. Pretty rogue, dear rogue, &c.\r\nare terms of endearment to one sex; pleasant rogue, witty rogue,\r\napply as familiar compliments to the other: Indeed _facetious rogue_\r\nis the common table appellation of this gentleman in Downing-street.\r\n\r\n[10] It will be observed by the attentive reader, that the thought\r\nof mounting the Hanoverian Horse, as a Pegasus, has been employed\r\nby Mr. Dundas, in his Ode preserved in this collection. It is true,\r\nthe Doctor has taken the reins out of his hands, as it was time\r\nsomebody should do. But I hereby forewarn the vulgar Critic, from\r\nthe poor joke of making the Doctor a horse-stealer.\r\n\r\n[11] Hither, brethren, &c.] When this Ode is performed in Westminster\r\nAbbey (as doubtless it will be) this Air is designed for the Reverend,\r\nor rather the Right Reverend Author. The numerous bench (for there\r\nwill hardly be more than three absentees) who will begin to chaunt\r\nthe subsequent chorus from their box at the right hand of his most\r\nsacred Majesty, will have fine effect both on the ear and eye.\r\n\r\n[12] Lords of the bed-chamber, &c.] Candour obliges us to confess,\r\nthat this designation of the performers, and in truth the following\r\nstanza, did not stand in the original copy, delivered into the\r\nLord Chamberlain's Office. Indeed, Signor Delpini had his doubts\r\nas to the legality of admitting it, notwithstanding Mr. Rose's\r\ntestimony, that it was actually and _bona fide_ composed with the rest\r\nof the Ode, and had only accidentally fallen into the same drawer\r\nof Mr. Pitt's bureau in which he had lately mislaid Mr. Gibbins's\r\nnote. Mr. Banks's testimony was also solicited to the same effect;\r\nbut he had left off vouching for the present session. Mr. Pepper\r\nArden, indeed, with the most intrepid liberality, engaged to find\r\nauthority for it in the statutes at large; on which Signor Delpini,\r\nwith his usual terseness of repartee, instantly exclaimed, Ha! ha! ha!\r\nHowever, the difficulty was at length obviated by an observation of\r\nthe noble Lord who presided, that in the case of the King versus\r\nArkinson, the House of Lords had established the right: of judges\r\nto amend a record, as Mr. Quarme had informed his Lordship\r\nimmediately after his having voted for that decision.\r\n  _Here end Mr. Robinson's notes._\r\n        \"A present God,\r\n        Heavy Hanover,\r\n        Abject Commons,\" &c.\r\n  The imitation will be obvious to the classical reader,\r\n      ------Præsens divus habebitur\r\n      Augustus, _ab_jectis Britannis,\r\n      Imperio, _gravibusque_ Persis.              HOR.\r\nAll the editors of Horace have hitherto read _ad_jectis Britannis.\r\nOur author, as sound a critic as a divine, _suo periculo_, makes\r\nthe alteration of a single letter, and thereby gives a new and\r\npeculiar force to the application of the passage.----N.B. _Abject_,\r\nin the author's understanding of the word, means that precise degree\r\nof submission due from a free people to monarchy. It is further worthy\r\nremark, that Horace wrote the Ode alluded to; before Britain was\r\nsubjected to absolute sway; and consequently the passage was meant as\r\na prophetic compliment to Augustus. Those who do not think that\r\nBritain is yet sufficiently _abject_, will regard the imitation in the\r\nsame light. We shall close this subject by observing, how much better\r\nGRAVIBUS applies in the imitation than in the original; and how well\r\nthe untruth of Ierne's volunteers joining in the deification,\r\nexemplifies the dedicatory address of the lie SUBLIME!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_NUMBER XVIII._\r\n\r\nIRREGULAR ODE,\r\n\r\n_By the_ MARQUIS OF GRAHAM.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n        Help! help!

HON. LORD VISCOUNT MOUNTMORRES,\r\nTO THE EARL OF SALISBURY.\r\n\r\nMY LORD,\r\nBeing informed from undoubted authority, that the learned _Pierot_,\r\nwhom your Lordship has thought proper to nominate to the dignity\r\nof your Assessor, knows no language but his own, it seemed to me\r\nprobable he might not understand _Irish_.--Now as I recollect my\r\nlast Ode to have proceeded on the orthography of that kingdom,\r\nI thought his entire ignorance of the tongue might perhaps be some\r\nhindrance to his judgment, upon its merit. On account of this\r\nunhappy ignorance, therefore, on the part of the worthy _Buffo_,\r\nof any language but _Italian_, I have taken the liberty to present\r\nyour Lordship and him with a second Ode, written in _English_;\r\nwhich I hope he will find no difficulty in understanding, and which\r\ncertainly has the better chance of being perfectly correct in the\r\ntrue English idiom, as it has been very carefully revised and\r\naltered by my worthy friend, Mr. _Henry Dundas_.\r\n      I have the honour to be,\r\n          My Lord,\r\n    Your Lordship's devoted servant,\r\n                              MOUNTMORRES.\r\n\r\n                    *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nODE,\r\n\r\n_By the_ RT.

HARVEY REDMOND MORRES,\r\nLORD VISCOUNT MOUNTMORRES,\r\nOF THE KINGDOM OF IRELAND, &c.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n    Ye gentle Nymphs, who rule the Song,\r\n    Who stray _Thessalian_ groves among,\r\n      With forms so bright and airy;\r\n    Whether you pierce _Pierian_ shades,              }\r\n    Or, less refin'd, adorn the glades,               }\r\n    And wanton with the lusty blades                  }\r\n      Of fruitful _Tipperary_;\r\n    Whether you sip Aonias' wave,\r\n    Or in thy stream, fair _Liffy_, lave;\r\n    Whether you taste ambrosial food;\r\n    Or think _potatoes_ quite as good,\r\n    Oh, listen to an _Irish_ Peer,\r\n    Who has woo'd your sex for many a year.\r\n\r\nII.\r\n    _Gold!_--thou bright benignant pow'r!\r\n    Parent of the jocund hour,\r\n  Say, how my breast has heav'd with many a storm,\r\n  When thee I worship'd in a _female_ form!\r\n      Thou, whose high and potent skill,\r\n      Turns things and persons at thy will!\r\n    Thou, whose omnipotent decree,\r\n      Mighty as Fate's eternal rule,\r\n      Can make a wise man of a fool,\r\n    And grace e'en loath'd deformity:\r\n    Can straitness give to her that's crook'd,\r\n    And _Grecian_ grace to nose that's hook'd;\r\n    Can smooth the mount on _Laura_'s back,\r\n    And wit supply to those that lack:\r\n    Say, and take pity on my woes,\r\n    Record my throbs, recount my throes;\r\n        How oft I sigh'd,\r\n        How oft I dy'd:\r\n        How oft dismiss'd,\r\n        How seldom kiss'd;\r\n  How oft, fair _Phyllida_, when thee I woo'd\r\n  With cautious foresight all thy charms I view'd.\r\n        O'er many a sod,\r\n        How oft I trod,\r\n        To count thy acres o'er;\r\n          Or spent my time,\r\n          For marle or lime,\r\n        With anxious zeal to bore[1]!\r\n  How _Cupid_ then all great and powerful sate,\r\n  Perch'd on the vantage of a rich estate;\r\n  When, for his darts, he us'd fair spreading trees,\r\n  Ah! _who_ cou'd fail that shot with shafts like these!\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n    Oh, sad example of capricious Fate!\r\n        Sue _Irishmen_ in vain!\r\n    Does _Pompey_'s self, the proud, the great,\r\n        Fail e'en a maid to gain?\r\n    What boots my form so tall and slim,\r\n    My legs so stout--my beard so grim?\r\n    Why have I _Alexander_'s bend?\r\n    Emblem of conquest never gain'd!\r\n    A nose so long--a back so strait--\r\n    A chairman's mien--a chairman's gait?\r\n    Why wasted ink to make orations?\r\n    Design'd to teach unlist'ning nations!\r\n      Why have I view'd th' ideal clock[2],\r\n        Or mourn'd the visionary hour?\r\n      Griev'd to behold with well-bred shock,\r\n        The fancy'd pointer verge _to four?_\r\n      Then with a bow, proceed to beg,\r\n      A general pardon on my leg--\r\n      \"Lament that to an hour so late,\"\r\n      \"'Twas mine to urge the grave debate!\"\r\n      \"Or mourn the rest, untimely broken!\"\r\n      All this to say--all this to do,\r\n      In form so native, neat, and new,\r\n    In speech _intended_ to be spoken!--\r\n  But fruitless all, for neither here or there,\r\n  My _leg_ has yet obtain'd me _place_, or _fair!_\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n  _Pompeys_ there are of every shape and size:\r\n    Some are the Great, y-clep'd, and some the Little,\r\n  Some with their deeds that fill the wond'ring skies,\r\n    And some on ladies' laps that eat their vittle!\r\n        'Tis _Morres_' boast--'tis _Morres_' pride,\r\n          To be to both ally'd!\r\n        That of all various _Pompeys_, he\r\n        Forms one complete _epitome_!\r\n    Prepar'd alike fierce Faction's host to fight,\r\n    Or, thankful, stoop _official crumbs_ to bite--\r\n    No equal to himself on earth to own;\r\n    Or watch, with anxious eye, on _Treasury-bone!_\r\n    As Rome's fam'd chief, imperious, stiff, and proud;\r\n    Fawning as curs, when supplicating food!\r\n    In him their several virtues all reside,\r\n    The peerless Puppy, and of Peers the pride!\r\n\r\nV.\r\n    Say, Critic _Buffo_, will not powers like these,\r\n    E'en thy refin'd fastidious judgment please?\r\n        A common _butt_ to all mankind,\r\n          'Tis my hard lot to be;\r\n        O let me then some justice find,\r\n          And give the BUTT to me!\r\n            Then dearest DE'L,\r\n            Thy praise I'll tell,\r\n          And with _unprostituted_ pen.\r\n        In _Warton_'s pure and modest strain,\r\n        Unwarp'd by Hope--unmov'd by Gain,\r\n  I'll call the \"best of husbands,\" and \"most chaste of men!\"\r\n        Then from my pristine labours I'll relax:\r\n        _Then will I lay the Tree unto the [3]Axe!_\r\n            Of all my former grief--\r\n        Resign the bus'ness of the anxious chace,\r\n        And for past failures, and for past disgrace,\r\n            Here find a snug relief!\r\n      The vain pursuit of female game give o'er,\r\n      And, hound of _Fortune_, scour the town no more!\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] When Lord Mountmorres went down into the country, some years\r\nago; to pay his addresses to a lady of large fortune, whose name\r\nwe forbear to mention, his Lordship took up his abode for several\r\ndays in a small public-house in the neighbourhood of her residence,\r\nand employed his time in making all proper enquiries, and prudent\r\nobservation upon the nature, extent, and value of her property:--he\r\nwas seen measuring the trees with his eye, and was at last found in\r\nthe act of boring for marle; when being roughly interrogated by one\r\nof the ladie's servants, to avoid chastisement he confessed his name,\r\nand delivered his amorous credentials. The amour terminated as ten\r\nthousand others of the noble Lord's have done!\r\n\r\n[2] An allusion is here made to a speech published by the noble Lord,\r\nwhich, as the title-page imports, was _intended_ to have been spoken;\r\nin which his Lordship, towards the conclusion, gravely\r\nremarks:--\"Having, Sir, so long encroached upon the patience of the\r\nHouse, and observing by the clock that the hour has become so\r\nexcessively late, nothing remains for me but to return my sincere\r\nthanks to you, Sir, and the other gentlemen of this House, for the\r\nparticular civility; and extreme attention, with which I have been\r\nheard:--the interesting nature of the occasion has betrayed me into a\r\nmuch greater length than I had any idea originally of running into;\r\nand if the casual warmth _of the moment_ has led me into the least\r\npersonal indelicacy towards any man alive, I am very ready to beg\r\npardon of him and this House, Sir, for having so done.\"\r\n\r\n[3] This line is literally transcribed from a speech of Lord\r\n_Mountmorre_'s, when Candidate some years ago for the Representation\r\nof the City of Westminster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_NUMBER XX._\r\n\r\nIRREGULAR ODE,\r\nFOR THE\r\nKING'S BIRTH-DAY,\r\n_By_ SIR GEORGE HOWARD, K.

I am, therefore, of opinion, that\r\nthe composition is certainly verse; though I would not wish to\r\npronounce too confidently. For further information I shall print\r\nhis Grace's letter.\r\n\r\nTO SIR JOHN HAWKINS, BART.\r\n\r\nSIR JOHN,\r\nAs I understand you are publishing an authentic Edition of the\r\nProbationary Odes. I call upon you to do me the justice of inserting\r\nthe enclosed. It was rejected on the Scrutiny by Signor Delpini,\r\nfor reasons which must have been suggested by the malevolence\r\nof some rival. The reasons were, 1st, That the Ode was nothing\r\nbut prose, written in an odd manner; and, 2dly, That the Metre,\r\nif there be any, as well as many of the thoughts, are stolen from\r\na little Poem, in a Collection called the UNION. To a man, blest\r\nwith an ear so delicate as your's, Sir John, I think it unnecessary\r\nto say any thing on the first charge; and as to the second, (would\r\nyou believe it?) the Poem from which I am accused of stealing is\r\nmy own! Surely an Author has a right to make free with his own ideas,\r\nespecially when, if they were ever known, they have long since\r\nbeen forgotten by his readers. You are not to learn, Sir John,\r\nthat _de non apparentibus & non existentibus eadem est ratio:_\r\nand nothing but the active spirit of literary jealousy, could\r\nhave dragged forth my former Ode from the obscurity, in which\r\nit has long slept, to the disgrace of all good taste in the present\r\nage. However, that you and the public may see, how little I have\r\nreally taken, and how much I have opened the thoughts, and improved\r\nthe language of that little, I send you _my imitations of myself_,\r\nas well as some few explanatory notes, necessary to elucidate\r\nmy classical and historical allusions.\r\n\r\n      I am, SIR JOHN,\r\n  With every wish for your success,\r\n    Your most obedient humble servant,\r\n                            WILLIAM YORK.\r\n\r\n                    *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nPINDARIC ODE,\r\n\r\nBy DR. W. MARKHAM,\r\nLord Archbishop of York, Primate of England, and Lord High Almoner\r\nto his Majesty, formerly Preceptor to the Princes, Head Master of\r\nWestminster School, &c. &c. &c.\r\n\r\nSTROPHE I.\r\n    The priestly mind what virtue so approves,\r\n    And testifies the pure prelatic spirit,\r\n          As loyal gratitude?\r\n    More to my King, than to my God, I owe;\r\n      God and my father made me man,\r\n    Yet not without my mother's added aid;\r\n      But George, without, or God, or man,\r\n  With grace endow', and hallow'd me Archbishop.\r\n\r\nANTISTROPHE I.\r\n    In Trojan PRIAM's court a laurel grew;\r\n    So VIRGIL sings. But I will sing the laurel,\r\n        Which at St. JAMES's blooms.\r\n    O may I bend my brows from that blest tree,\r\n      Not flourishing in native green,\r\n    Refreshed with dews from AGANIPPE's spring:\r\n      But, [1]like the precious plant of DIS,\r\n    Glitt'ring with gold, with royal sack irriguous.\r\n\r\nEPODE I.\r\n      So shall my aukward gratitude,\r\n  With fond presumption to the Laureat's duty\r\n      Attune my rugged numbers blank.\r\n  Little I reck the meed of such a song;\r\n          Yet will I stretch aloof,\r\n      And tell of Tory principles,\r\n          The right Divine of Kings;\r\n  And Power Supreme that brooks not bold contention:\r\n  Till all the zeal monarchial\r\n  That fired the Preacher, in the Bard shall blaze,\r\n  And what my Sermons were, my Odes once more shall be.\r\n\r\nSTROPHE II.\r\n  [2]Good PRICE, to Kings and me a foe no more,\r\n  By LANSDOWN won, shall pay with friendly censure\r\n          His past hostility.\r\n  Nor shall not He assist, my pupil once,\r\n      Of stature small, but doughty tongue,\r\n  Bold ABINGDON, whose rhetoric unrestrain'd,\r\n      Rashes, more lyrically wild,\r\n  [3]Than GREENE's mad lays, when he out-pindar'd PINDAR.\r\n\r\nANTISTROPHE II.\r\n  With him too, EFFINGHAM his aid shall join,\r\n  [4] Who, erst by GORDON led, with bonfires usher'd\r\n      His Sov'reign's natal month.\r\n  Secure in such allies, to princely themes,\r\n    To HENRY's and to EDWARD's young.\r\n  Dear names, I'll meditate the faithful song;\r\n      How oft beneath my birch severe,\r\n  Like EFFINGHAM and ABINGDON, they tingled:\r\n\r\nEPODE II.\r\n      Or to the YOUTH IMMACULATE\r\n    Ascending thence, I'll sing the strain celestial,\r\n      By PITT, to bless our isle restor'd.\r\n    _Trim_ plenty, _not luxuriant_ as of old,\r\n      Peace, laurel-crown'd no more;\r\n      [5] Justice, that smites by scores, unmov'd;\r\n      And her of verdant locks,\r\n    Commerce, like Harlequin, in motley vesture,\r\n      [6]Whose magic sword with sudden sleight,\r\n    Wav'd o'er the HIBERNIAN treaty, turns to bonds,\r\n  The dreams of airy wealth, that play'd round PATRICK's[7] eyes.\r\n\r\nSTROPHE III.\r\n  But lo! yon bark, that rich with India spoils,\r\n  O'er the wide-swilling ocean rides triumphant,\r\n          Oh! to BRITANNIA's shore\r\n  In safety waft, ye winds, the precious freight!\r\n          'Tis HASTINGS; of the prostrate EAST\r\n  Despotic arbiter; whose [8] bounty gave\r\n          My MARKHAM's delegated rule\r\n  To riot in the plunder of BENARES.\r\n\r\nANTISTROPHE III.\r\n    How yet affrighted GANGES, oft distain'd\r\n  With GENTOO carnage, quakes thro' all his branches!\r\n          Soon may I greet the morn,\r\n  When, HASTINGS screen'd, DUNDAS and GEORGE's name.\r\n    Thro' BISHOPTHORP's[9] glad roofs shall sound,\r\n  Familiar in domestic merriment;\r\n    Or in thy chosen PLACE, ST. JAMES,\r\n  Be carol'd loud amid th' applauding IMHOFFS!\r\n\r\nEPODE III.\r\n        When wealthy Innocence, pursued\r\n    By Factious Envy, courts a Monarch's succour,\r\n        Mean gifts of vulgar cost, alike\r\n    Dishonour him, who gives, and him, who takes.\r\n            Not thus shall HASTINGS sav'd,\r\n      Thee, BRUNSWICK, and himself disgrace.\r\n        [10]O may thy blooming Heir,\r\n    In virtues equal, be like thee prolific!\r\n        Till a new race of little GUELPS,\r\n    Beneath the rod of future MARKHAMS train'd,\r\n  Lisp on their Grandsire's knee his mitred Laureat's lays.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] See Virgil's Æneid, b. vi.\r\n\r\n[2] During the Administration of Lord SHELBURNE, I was told by\r\na friend of mine, that Dr. PRICE took occasion, in his presence,\r\nto declare the most lively abhorrence of the damnable heresies,\r\nwhich he had formerly advanced against the _Jure divino_ doctrines,\r\ncontained in some of my Sermons.\r\n\r\n[3] See a translation of PINDAR, by EDWARD BURNABY GKEENE.\r\n\r\n[4] This alludes wholly to a private anecdote, and in no degree\r\nto certain malicious reports of the noble Earl's conduct during\r\nthe riots of June, 1780.\r\n\r\n[5] The present Ministry have twice gratified the public, with\r\nthe awfully sublime spectacle of twenty hanged at one time.\r\n\r\n[6] These three lines, I must confess, have been interpolated\r\nsince the introduction of the fourth Proposition in the new _Irish_\r\nResolutions. They arose, however, quite naturally out of my preceding\r\npersonification of commerce.\r\n\r\n[7] I have taken the liberty of employing _Patrick_ in the same\r\nsense as _Paddy_, to personify the people of _Ireland_. The latter\r\nname was too colloquial for the dignity of my blank verse.\r\n\r\n[8] One of the many frivolous charges brought against Mr. Hastings\r\nby factious men, is the removal of a Mr. FOWKE, contrary to the\r\norders of the Directors, that he might make room for his own\r\nappointment of my so to the Residentship of BENARES. I have ever\r\nthought it my duty to support the late Governor-General, both at\r\nLeadenhall and in the House of Peers, against all such vexatious\r\naccusations.\r\n\r\n[9] As many of my Competitors have complained of Signer Delpini's\r\nignorance, I cannot help remarking here, that he did not know\r\nBISHOPTHORP to be the name of my palace, in Yorkshire; he did\r\nnot know Mr. Hastings's house to be in St. James's-place; he did\r\nnot know Mrs. Hastings to have two sons by Mynheer _Imhoff_, her\r\nformer husband, still living. And what is more shameful than\r\nall in a Critical Assessor, he had never heard of the poetical\r\nfigure, by which I elegantly say, _thy place, St. James's,_ instead\r\nof _St. James's-place_.\r\n\r\n[10] Signor Delpini wanted to strike out all that follows, because\r\ntruly it had no connection with the rest. The transition, like\r\nsome others in this and my former Ode to Arthur Onslow, Esq. may\r\nbe too fine for vulgar apprehensions, but it is therefore the\r\nmore Pindaric.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMITATIONS OF MYSELF.\r\n\r\n_Strophe_ I.\r\n  This goodly frame what virtue so approves,\r\n  And testifies the pure ætherial spirit,\r\n  As mild benevolence?\r\n                        _My Ode to Arthur Onslow, Esq._\r\n\r\n_Epode_ I.\r\n    How shall my aukward gratitude,\r\n  And the presumption of untutor'd duty\r\n    Attune thy numbers all too rude?\r\n  Little he recks the meed of such a song;\r\n    Yet will I stretch aloof, &c.\r\n                                                _Ibid_.\r\n\r\n_Antistrophe_ II.\r\n      To HENRYS and to EDWARDS old,\r\n  Dread names, I'll meditate the faithful song, &c.\r\n                                                _Ibid_.\r\n\r\n_Epode_ II.\r\n          Justice with steady brow,\r\n  _Trim_ plenty, _Laureat_ peace, and _green-hair'd_ commerce,\r\n          In flowing robe of _thousand hues_, &c.\r\nOn this imitation of myself, I cannot help remarking, how happily\r\nI have now applied some of these epithets, which, it must be\r\nconfessed, had not half the propriety before.\r\n\r\n_Strophe_ III.\r\n  Or trace her navy, where in towering pride\r\n  O'er the wide-swelling waste it rolls avengeful.\r\n                                                _Ibid_.\r\n\r\n_Antistrophe_ III.\r\n    How headlong Rhone and Ebro, erst distain'd\r\n    With Moorish carnage, quakes thro' all her branches!\r\n        Soon shall I greet the morn,\r\n    When, Europe saved, BRITAIN and GEORGE's name\r\n      Shall soon o'er FLANDRIA's level field,\r\n    Familiar in domestic merriment;\r\n      Or by the jolly mariner\r\n  Be carol'd loud adown the echoing Danube.\r\n                                                _Ibid_.\r\n\r\n_Epode_ III.\r\n          O may your rising hope,\r\n    Well-principled in every virtue, bloom,\r\n          'Till a fresh-springing flock implore,\r\n    With infant hands, a Grandsire's powerful prayer,\r\n  Or round your honour'd couch their pratling sports pursue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_NUMBER XXII._\r\n\r\nODE,\r\n\r\n_By the_ REV.

His Majesty, amazed at the sight\r\nof such a figure in such a place, had already given orders to one\r\nof the attendant beef-eaters to dismiss him from his presence,\r\nwhen, by a certain hasty spasmodic mumbling, together with two or\r\nthree prompt quotations from Virgil, the person was discovered to be\r\nno other than the Rev. Mr. _Thomas Warton_ himself, dressed in the\r\nofficial vesture of his professorship, and the paper which he held\r\nin his hand being nothing else but a fair-written petition, designed\r\nfor the inspection of his Majesty, our gracious Sovereign, made up\r\nfor the seeming rudeness of the first reception, by a hearty embrace\r\non recognition; and the contents of the petition being forthwith\r\nexamined, were found to be pretty nearly as follows.----We omit\r\nthe common-place compliments generally introduced in the exordia\r\nof these applications, as \"relying upon your Majesty's well-known\r\nclemency;\" \"convinced of your Royal regard for the real interest\r\nof your subjects;\" \"penetrated with the fullest conviction of your\r\nwisdom and justice,\" &c. &c. which, though undoubtedly very true,\r\nwhen considered as addressed to George the Third, _might_, perhaps,\r\nas matters of mere form, be applied to a Sovereign, who neither\r\nhad proved wisdom nor regard for his subjects in one act of his reign,\r\nand proceed to the substance and matter of the complaint itself.\r\nIt sets forth,  \"That the Petitioner, Mr. _Thomas_, had been many years\r\na maker of Poetry, as his friend Mr. _Sadler_, the pastry-cook, of\r\nOxford, and some other creditable witnesses, could well evince:\r\nthat many of his works of fancy, and more particularly that one,\r\nwhich is known by the name of his _Criticisms upon Milton_, had been\r\nwell received by the learned; that thus encouraged, he had entered\r\nthe list, together with many other great and respectable candidates,\r\nfor the honour of a succession to the vacant _Laureatship_; that a\r\ndecided return had been made in his favour by the officers best\r\ncalculated to judge, namely, the Right Hon. the Earl of Salisbury,\r\nand the learned _Signor Delpini_, his Lordship's worthy coadjutor;\r\nthat the Signor's delicacy, unhappily for the Petitioner, like that\r\nof Mr. _Corbett_, in the instance of the Westminster election, had\r\ninclined him to the grant of a SCRUTINY; that in consequence of the\r\nvexatious and pertinacious perseverance on the part of several\r\ngentlemen in this illegal and oppressive measure, the Petitioner\r\nhad been severely injured in his spirits, his comforts, and his\r\ninterest: that he had been for many years engaged in a most laborious\r\nand expensive undertaking, in which he had been honoured with the\r\nmost liberal communications from all the universities in Europe,\r\nto wit, a splendid and most correct edition of the _Poemata Minora_,\r\nof the immortal Mr. _Stephen Duck_; that he was also under positive\r\narticles of literary partnership with his brother, the learned and\r\nwell-known Dr. _Joseph_, to supply two pages per day in his new work,\r\nnow in the press, entitled his Essay _on the Life and Writings_ of\r\nMr. THOMAS HICKATHRIFT; in both of which great undertakings, the\r\nprogress had been most essentially interrupted by the great anxiety\r\nand distress of mind, under which the Petitioner has for some time\r\nlaboured, on account of this inequitable scrutiny; that the Petitioner\r\nis bound by his honour and his engagement to prepare a new Ode for\r\nthe birth-day of her most gracious Majesty, which he is very desirous\r\nof executing with as much poetry, perspicuity, and originality, as\r\nare universally allowed to have characterised his last effusion,\r\nin honour of the Natal Anniversary of his Royal Master's sacred\r\nself; that there are but six months to come for such a preparation,\r\nand that the Petitioner has got no farther yet than 'Hail Muse!'\r\nin the first stanza, which very much inclines him to fear he shall\r\nnot be able to finish the whole in the short period above-mentioned,\r\nunless his Majesty should be graciously pleased to order some of\r\nhis Lords of the Bed-chamber to assist him, or should command a\r\ntermination to the vexatious enquiry now pending. In humble hopes\r\nthat these several considerations would have their due influence\r\nwith his Majesty, the Petitioner concludes with the usual prayer,\r\nand signed himself as underneath, &c. &c. &c.\r\n                                            THO. WARTON, B.D. &c. &c.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the influence of the above admirable appeal on the\r\nsympathetic feelings of Majesty, that the sermon, which we understand\r\nwas founded upon the text, \"_Let him keep his tongue from evil, and\r\nhis lips that they speak no untruth_,\" and which was _not_ preached by\r\nDr. _Prettyman_, was entirely neglected, and a message instantly\r\nwritten, honoured by the Sign Manual, and directed to the office\r\nof the Right Hon. Lord _Sydney_, Secretary for the Home Department,\r\nenjoining an immediate redress for Mr. _Thomas_, and a total\r\nsuspension of any further proceedings in a measure which (as the\r\nenergy of Royal eloquence expressed it) was of such unexampled\r\ninjustice, illegality, and oppression, as that of a _scrutiny after a\r\nfair poll, and a decided superiority of admitted suffrages_. This\r\nmessage, conveyed, as its solemnity well required, by no other Person\r\nthan the Honourable young _Tommy_ himself, Secretary to his amazing\r\nfather, had its due influence with the Court; the Noble Lord broke his\r\nwand; Mr. _Delpini_ executed a _chacone_, and tried at a _somerset_;\r\nhe grinned a grim obedience to the mandate, and calling for pen, ink,\r\nand paper, wrote the following letter to the Printer of that favourite\r\ndiurnal vehicle through whose medium these effusions had been\r\nheretofore submitted to the public:\r\n\r\n\"_Monsieur_,\r\nOn vous requis, you are hereby commandie not to pooblish any more\r\nof de _Ode Probationare--mon cher ami, Monsieur George le Roi_, says\r\nit be ver bad to vex Monsieur le petit homme avec le grand\r\npaunch--_Monsieur Wharton_, any more vid scrutinée; je vous commande\r\nderefore to finis--Que le Roi soit loué!--God save de King! mind vat I\r\nsay--ou le grand George and le bon Dieu damn votre ame & bodie, vos\r\njambes, & vos pies, for ever and ever--pour jamais.\r\n                                                (Signed) DELPINI.\"\r\n\r\nNothing now remained, but for the Judges to make their return,\r\nwhich having done in favour of Mr. _Thomas Warton_, the original\r\nobject of their preference, whom they now pronounced duly elected,\r\nthe following Imperial notice was published in the succeeding\r\nSaturday's _Gazette_, confirming the Nomination, and giving legal\r\nSanction to the Appointment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nTo all CHRISTIAN PEOPLE to whom these presents shall come, greeting,\r\n\r\nKnow Ye, That by and with the advice, consent, concurrence, and\r\napprobation of our right trusty and well-beloved cousins, James Cecil,\r\nEarl of Salisbury, and Antonio Franciso Ignicio Delpini, Esq. Aur.\r\nand Pierot to the Theatre-royal, Hay-market, WE, for divers good\r\ncauses and considerations, us thereunto especially moving, have\r\nmade, ordained, nominated, constituted, and appointed, and by\r\nthese presents do make, ordain, nominate, constitute, and appoint,\r\nthe Rev. Thomas Warton, B.D. to be our true and only legal Laureat,\r\nPoet, and Poetaster; that is to say, to pen, write, compose,\r\ntranspose, select, dictate, compile, indite, edite, invent, design,\r\nsteal, put together, transcribe, frame, fabricate, manufacture,\r\nmake, join, build, scrape, grub, collect, vamp, find, discover,\r\ncatch, smuggle, pick-up, beg, borrow, or buy, in the same manner\r\nand with the same privileges as have been usually practised, and\r\nheretofore enjoyed by every other Laureat, whether by our Sacred\r\nSelf appointed, or by our Royal predecessors, who now dwell with\r\ntheir fathers: and for this purpose, to produce, deliver, chaunt,\r\nor sing, as in our wisdom aforesaid we shall judge proper, at the\r\nleast three good and substantial Odes, in the best English or\r\nGerman verse, in every year, that is to say, one due and proper Ode\r\non the Nativity of our blessed Self; one due and proper Ode on\r\nthe Nativity of our dearest and best beloved Royal Consort, for\r\nthe time being; and also one due and proper Ode on the day of the\r\nNativity of every future Year, of which God grant We may see many.\r\nAnd we do hereby most strictly command and enjoin, that no Scholar,\r\nCritic, Wit, Orthographer, or Scribbler, shall, by gibes, sneers,\r\njests, judgments, quibbles, or criticisms, molest, interrupt,\r\nincommode, disturb, or confound the said Thomas Warton, or break the\r\npeace of his orderly, quiet, pains-taking, and inoffensive Muse, in\r\nthe said exercise of his said duty. And we do hereby will and direct,\r\nthat if any of the person or persons aforesaid, notwithstanding our\r\nabsolute and positive command, shall be found offending against\r\nthis our Royal Proclamation, that he, she, or they being duly\r\nconvicted, shall, for every such crime and misdemeanor, be punished\r\nin the manner and form following; to wit--For the first offence he\r\nshall be drawn on a sledge to the most conspicuous and notorious\r\npart of our ever faithful city of London, and shall then and there,\r\nwith an audible voice, pronounce, read, and deliver three several\r\nprinted speeches of our right, trusty, and approved MAJOR JOHN\r\nSCOTT.--For the second offence, that he be required to translate into\r\ngood and lawful English one whole unspoken speech of our right\r\ntrusty and well-beloved cousin and councellor, Lord Viscount\r\nMOUNTMORRES, of the kingdom of _Ireland_;--and for the third offence,\r\nthat he be condemned to read one whole page of the Poems, Essays,\r\nor Criticisms of our said Laureat, Mr. Thomas Warton.----And whereas\r\nthe said office of Laureat is a place of the last importance,\r\ninasmuch as the person holding it has confided to him the care\r\nof making the Royal virtues known to the world; and we being minded\r\nand desirous that the said T. Warton should execute and perform\r\nthe duties of his said office with the utmost dignity and decorum,\r\nNOW KNOW YE, That we have thought it meet to draw up a due and\r\nproper Table of Instructions, hereunto annexed, for the use of\r\nthe said Thomas Warton, in his said poetical exercise and employment,\r\nwhich we do hereby most strictly will and enjoin the said Thomas\r\nWarton to abide by and follow, under pain of incurring our most\r\nhigh displeasure.\r\n\r\n                          Given at our Court at St. James's, this\r\n                              30th day of May, one thousand seven\r\n                              hundred and eighty-five.\r\n                                             _Vivant Rex & Regina._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nFOR THE\r\nREV. THOMAS WARTON, B.D. AND P.L. &c. &c.\r\n                      _Chamberlain's Office, May 30th, 1785._\r\n\r\n1st, That in fabricating the catalogue of Regal Virtues (in which\r\ntask the Poet may much assist his invention by perusing the Odes\r\nof his several predecessors) you be particularly careful not to\r\nomit his Chastity, his skill in Mechanics, and his Royal Talent\r\nof Child-getting.--\r\n\r\n2dly, It is expected that you should be very liberally endowed\r\nwith the gift of Prophecy; but be very careful not to predict any\r\nevent but what may be perfectly acceptable to your Sovereign, such\r\nas the subjugation of America, the destruction of the Whigs,\r\nlong-life, &c. &c.\r\n\r\n3dly, That you be always provided with a due assortment of true,\r\ngood-looking, and legitimate words; and that you do take all\r\nnecessary care not to apply them but on their proper occasions;\r\nas for example, not to talk of dove-eyed peace, nor the gentle\r\nolive, in time of war; nor of trumpets, drums, fifes, nor\r\n[1]ECHOING CARS, in times of peace--as, for the sake of poetical\r\nconveniency, several of your predecessors have been known to do.\r\n\r\n4thly, That as the Sovereign for the time being must always be\r\nthe best, the greatest, and the wisest, that ever existed; so\r\nthe year also, for the time being, must be the happiest, the\r\nmildest, the fairest, and the most prolific that ever occurred.--What\r\nreflections upon the year past you think proper.\r\n\r\n5thly, That Music being a much higher and diviner science than\r\nPoetry, your Ode must always be adapted to the Music, and not\r\nthe Music to your Ode.--The omission of a line or two cannot be\r\nsupposed to make any material difference either in the poetry\r\nor in sense.\r\n\r\n6thly, That as these sort of invitations have of late years been\r\nconsidered by the Muses as mere cards of compliment, and of course\r\nhave been but rarely accepted, you must not waste more than twenty\r\nlines in invoking the Nine, nor repeat the word \"Hail!\" more than\r\nfifteen times at farthest.\r\n\r\n7thly, And finally, That it may not be amiss to be a little\r\nintelligible[2].\r\n\r\n[1] It is evident from this expression, that these instructions\r\nhad not been delivered to Mr. Warton at the time of his writing\r\nhis last famous Ode on the Birth-day of his Majesty: a circumstance\r\nwhich makes that amazing composition still more extraordinary.\r\n\r\n[2] This is an additional proof that Mr. Warton had not received,\r\nthe Instructions at the time he composed his said Ode.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL MISCELLANIES;\r\n\r\nBY\r\nTHE AUTHORS\r\nOF\r\n_THE ROLLIAD_\r\nAND\r\nPROBATIONARY ODES.\r\n\r\n                    *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n  -- LONGÆVO DICTA PARENTI\r\n  HAUD DUBITANDA REFER.           VIRGIL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PUBLIC.\r\n\r\nThe very favourable reception given to the ROLLIAD, and PROBATIONARY\r\nODES, has induced the Editor to conceive, that a collection of\r\npolitical _Jeus d'Esprits_, by the authors of those celebrated\r\nperformances, would prove equally acceptable. Various publications\r\nupon a similar plan have already been attempted; but their good\r\nthings have been so scantily interspersed, that they have appeared\r\nlike GRATIANO's reasons, \"_as two grains of_ WHEAT _in a bushel of_\r\nCHAFF.\" In the present Edition are contained not only a number\r\nof pieces which have at different times been given to the Public,\r\nbut also a variety of Original Articles, which but for the flattering\r\nconfidence of private friendship, would have still remained in\r\nthe closets of their authors. MISCELLANIES, indeed, in any state,\r\nfrom the variety which they afford, must ever be attractive; but,\r\nwhen added to this inherent advantage, they also possess the benefit\r\nof a proper selection, their attraction must of necessity become\r\nmaterially enhanced. The fame of the Authors of the following\r\nsheets is too well established in the mind of every person of\r\ntaste and literature, to derive any aid from our feeble panegyric.\r\nIt is only to be lamented that, from the peculiar circumstances\r\nunder which these their poetical offspring make their appearance,\r\nthe Parents' names cannot be announced to the world with all that\r\nparade which accompanies a more legal intercourse with the Muses.\r\nPerhaps, however, the vigour and native energy of the Parents,\r\nappear much more prominent in these ardent inspirations of nature,\r\nthan in the cold, nerveless, unimpassioned efforts of a legitimate\r\nproduction. It may here be objected by some fastidious critics,\r\nthat if writings, evidently so reputable to the fame of the authors,\r\nare of such a construction as to be unfit to be acknowledged, that\r\nthey are equally unfit for publication: but let these gentlemen\r\nrecollect, that it has ever been held perfectly justifiable to\r\nutter those sarcasms under a masque, which the strict rules of\r\ndecorum would render inadmissible in any other situation. The shafts\r\nof ridicule have universally been found more efficacious in correcting\r\nfolly and impertinence, than the most serious reproof; and while\r\nwe pursue the example of POPE, SWIFT, ARBUTHNOT, ADDISON, and others\r\nof the wittiest, the wisest, and the best men of the age in which\r\nthey lived, we shall little fear the cavils of ill-nature. If it\r\nshould be urged that the subjects of these political productions\r\nare merely temporary, and will be forgotten with the hour which\r\ngave them birth; let it at the same time be recollected, that though\r\nthe heroes of the DUNCIAD have sunk into their native obscurity,\r\nthe reputation of the poem which celebrated their worth, still\r\nretains its original splendour. And, in truth, as a matter of equity,\r\nif blockheads and dunces are worthy to be recorded in the Poet's\r\npage, why may not Privy Councillors and Lords of the Bedchamber\r\ndemand a similar exaltation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL MISCELLANIES.\r\n\r\n                    *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nPROBATIONARY ODE\r\nEXTRAORDINARY,\r\n_By the Rev_.

Author, must remain for\r\ntime, or Mr, FRANCIS BARBER, to develope.--Having, however, been\r\nfortunate enough to procure a copy, we have printed both the Odes\r\nin opposite leaves, that in case the latter supposition should\r\nturn out to be well founded, the public may decide how far the worthy\r\nmagistrate was justified in this exclusion.]\r\n\r\n\r\nODE                                       ODE\r\n\r\n_To the Honourable_ WILLIAM PITT.         _To the Right Hon._ WILLIAM PITT.\r\n\r\n_By_ W.

Perhaps, as the noble Lord was then\r\non the point of marriage, he might intend this offering of his\r\n_opima spolia_, as an elegant compliment to HYMEN.\r\n\r\nLine 51.--_But Reverend_ JENKY.] Our Author here, in some measure\r\ndeviating from his usual perspicuity, has left us in doubt whether\r\nthe term _Reverend_ is applied to the years or to the profession\r\nof the gentleman intended to be complimented.

He questions not that great\r\nman's pretensions; far from it; he reveres his ancestors, adores\r\nhis talents, and feels something hardly short of idolatry towards\r\nhis manners and accomplishments.--But still, why such profusion\r\nof distinction towards one, to the exclusion of many other high\r\ncharacters? Our Poet professes to feel this injustice extremely,\r\nand has made the following attempt to rescue one deserving man from\r\nso unmerited an obloquy. The reader will perceive the measure to\r\nbe an imitation of that which has been so deservedly admired in\r\nour immortal bard, in his play of \"_As You Like It._\"\r\n\r\n  From the East to the Western Inde\r\n  No Jewel is like Rosalind;\r\n  Her worth being mounted on the wind,\r\n  Thro' all the world bears Rosalind, &c. &c.\r\n\r\nThis kind of verse is adopted by the poet to avoid any appearance\r\nof too servile an imitation of the ROLLIAD. He begins,\r\n\r\n  Ye patriots all, both great and small,\r\n  Resign the palm to DELAVAL;\r\n  The virtues would'st thou practise all,\r\n  So in a month did DELAVAL.\r\n  A _patriot_ first both stout and tall,\r\n  Firm for the day was DELAVAL.\r\n  The friend to court, where frowns appal,\r\n  The next became good DELAVAL.--\r\n  Wilt thou against oppression bawl?\r\n  Just so did valiant DELAVAL!\r\n  Yet in a month, thyself enthral,\r\n  So did the yielding DELAVAL:\r\n  Yet give to both, a dangerous fall,\r\n  So did reflecting DELAVAL.\r\n  If resignation's good in all,\r\n  Why so it is in DELAVAL:\r\n  For if you p--- against a wall,\r\n  Just so you may 'gainst DELAVAL:\r\n  And if with foot you kick a ball,\r\n  E'en so you may--a DELAVAL.\r\n  'Gainst _influence_ would'st thou vent thy gall,\r\n  Thus did the patriot DELAVAL:\r\n  Yet servile stoop to Royal call,\r\n  So did the loyal DELAVAL.\r\n  What friend to Freedom's fair-built Hall,\r\n  Was louder heard than DELAVAL?\r\n  Yet who the _Commons_ rights to maul,\r\n  More stout was found than DELAVAL?\r\n  --'Gainst Lords and Lordlings would'st thou brawl,\r\n  Just so did he--SIR DELAVAL:\r\n  Yet on thy knees, to honours crawl,\r\n  Oh! so did he--LORD DELAVAL.\r\n  An evil sprite possessed SAUL,\r\n  And so it once did DELAVAL.\r\n  Music did soon the sense recal,\r\n  Of ISRAEL's King, and DELAVAL,\r\n  SAUL rose at DAVID's vile cat-call.\r\n  --Not so the wiser DELAVAL:\r\n  'Twas money's sweetest _sol, la fal_,\r\n  That chear'd the sense of DELAVAL--\r\n  When royal power shall instal,\r\n  With honours new LORD DELAVAL;\r\n  Who won't say--the _miraculous_ hawl\r\n  Is caught by faithful DELAVAL?\r\n  'Gainst rapine would'st thou preach like Paul,\r\n  Thus did religious DELAVAL:\r\n  Yet screen the scourges of Bengal,\r\n  Thus did benignant DELAVAL.\r\n  To future times recorded shall\r\n  Be all the worths of DELAVAL:\r\n  E'en OSSIAN, or the great FINGAL,\r\n  Shall yield the wreath to DELAVAL.\r\n  From Prince's court to cobler's stall,\r\n  Shall sound the name of DELAVAL:\r\n  For neither sceptre nor the awl,\r\n  Are strong and keen as DELAVAL.--\r\n  Some better praise, than this poor scrawl,\r\n  Shall sing the fame of DELAVAL:\r\n  For sure no song can ever pall,\r\n  That celebrates great DELAVAL:\r\n  Borne on all fours, the fame shall sprawl.\r\n  To latest time--of DELAVAL:\r\n  Then come, ye Nine, in one great squall,\r\n  Proclaim the worths of DELAVAL.\r\n\r\n[_The annotations of the learned are expected._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS IS THE HOUSE THAT GEORGE[1] BUILT.\r\n\r\nLord NUGENT.--This is the RAT, that eat the Malt, that lay in\r\nthe House that George built.\r\n\r\nMr. FOX.--This is the CAT, that killed the Rat, that eat the\r\nMalt, that lay in the House that George built.\r\n\r\nPEPPER ARDEN.--This is the DOG, that barked at the Cat, that\r\nkilled the Rat, that eat the Malt, that lay in the House that\r\nGeorge built.\r\n\r\nLord THURLOW.--This is the BULL with the crumpled horn, that\r\nroared with the Dog, that barked at the Cat, that killed the Rat,\r\nthat eat the Malt, that lay in the House that George built.\r\n\r\nMr. PITT.--This is the MAIDEN[2] all forlorn, that coaxed the\r\nBull with the crumpled horn, that roared with the Dog, that barked\r\nat the Cat, that killed the Rat, that eat the Malt, that lay in\r\nthe House that George built.\r\n\r\nMr. DUNDAS.--This is the SCOT by all forsworn, that wedded[3]\r\nthe Maiden all forlorn, that coaxed the Bull with the crumpled\r\nhorn, that roared with the Dog, that barked at the Cat, that\r\nkilled the Rat, that eat the Malt, that lay in the House that\r\nGeorge built.\r\n\r\nMr. WILKES.--This is the PATRIOT covered with scorn, that flattered\r\nthe Scot by all forsworn, that wedded the Maiden all forlorn,\r\nthat coaxed the Bull with the crumpled horn, that roared with\r\nthe Dog, that barked at the Cat, that killed the Rat, that eat\r\nthe Malt, that lay in the House that George built.\r\n\r\nCONSCIENCE.--This is the COCK that crowed in the morn, that waked\r\nthe Patriot covered with scorn, that flattered the Scot by all\r\nforsworn, that wedded the Maiden all forlorn, that coaxed the\r\nBull with the crumpled horn, that roared with the Dog, that barked\r\nat the Cat, that killed the Rat, that eat the Malt, that lay in\r\nthe House that George built.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] George Nugent Grenville, Marquis of Buckingham.\r\n\r\n[2] The immaculate continence of the BRITISH SCIPIO, so strongly\r\ninsisted on by his friends, as constituting one of the most shining\r\ningredients of his own uncommon character, is only alluded to here\r\nas a received fact, and not by any means as a reproach.\r\n\r\n[3] _Wedded_.

To tell ROSE, that I found three cocks out of repair--didn't\r\nknow what to do--left my name at the DUKE OF QUEENSBERRY's--dined\r\nat WHITE's--the pease tough--Lord APSLEY thought they ought to be\r\nboiled in steam--VILLIERS very _warm_ in favour of _hot water_--PITT\r\nfor the new mode--and much talk of _taking the sense_ of the\r\n_club_--but happily I prevented matters going to extremity.\r\n\r\n_May_ 21.

Trope comes from the Greek word\r\n_Trepo_, to turn. I believe that tropes can only exist in a vocal\r\nlanguage, for I do not recollect to have met with any among the\r\nsavages near the Pole, who converse only by signs; or if they used\r\nany, I did not understand them. Aristotle is of opinion that horses\r\nhave not the use of tropes.--Dean Swift seems to be of a contrary\r\nopinion; but be this as it may, tropes are of very great importance\r\nin Parliament, and I cannot enough recommend them to my young readers.\r\n\r\n\"_Tropes_ are of two kinds: 1st, such as tend to illustrate our\r\nmeaning; and 2dly, such as tend to render it obscure. The first are of\r\ngreat use in the _sermo pedestris_; the second in the sublime. They\r\ngive the _os magna sonans_; or, as the same poet says in another\r\nplace, the _ore rotundo_; an expression, which shows, by the bye, that\r\nit is as necessary to round your mouth, as to round your periods.--But\r\nof this more hereafter, when I come to treat of _mouthing_, or, as the\r\nLatins call it, _elocutio_.\r\n\r\n\"In the course of my reflections on tropes, I have frequently lamented\r\nthe want of these embellishments in our modern _log-books_. Strabo\r\nsays they were frequently employed by the ancient sailors; nor can we\r\nwonder at this difference, since our young seamen are such bad\r\nscholars: not so in other countries; for I have seen children at the\r\nisland of _Zanti_, who knew more of Greek than any First Lieutenant.\r\nNow to return to Tropes, and of their use in Parliament. I will give\r\nyou some examples of the most perfect kind in each species, and then\r\nquit the subject; only observing, that the worst kind of tropes are\r\n_puns_; and that tropes, when used in controversy, ought to be very\r\nobscure; for many people do not know how to answer what they do not\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose I was desirous of pressing forward any measure, and that I\r\napprehended that the opposite party wished to delay it, I should\r\npersonify procrastination by one of the following manners:\r\n\r\n1. \"_This measure appears to be filtered through the drip-stone of\r\nprocrastination._\" This beautiful phrase was invented by a near\r\nrelation of mine, whose talents bid fair to make a most distinguished\r\nfigure in the senate.\r\n\r\n2. \"_This is another dish cooked up by the procrastinating spirit._\"\r\nThe boldness of this figure, which was invented by Mr. Drake, cannot\r\nbe too much admired.\r\n\r\n3. \"_This appears to be the last hair in the tail of\r\nprocrastination._\"\r\n\r\n\"The _Master of the Rolls_, who first used this phrase, is a most\r\neloquent speaker; but I think the two former instances much more\r\nbeautiful, inasmuch as the latter personification is drawn from a\r\ndumb creature, which is not so fine a source of metaphor as a\r\nChristian.\r\n\r\n\"Having thus exhausted the subject of metaphors, I shall say a few\r\nwords concerning _similes_, the second of tropical figures, in point\r\nof importance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTES OF MR. PITT.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs nothing which relates to this great man can be indifferent to\r\nthe public, we are happy in laying before our readers the following\r\nparticulars, the truth of which may be depended on:--\r\n\r\nMR. PITT rises about _Nine_, when the weather is clear; but if it\r\nshould rain, Dr. PRETTYMAN advises him to lay about an hour longer.\r\nThe first thing he _does_ is to eat _no_ breakfast, that he may have\r\na better appetite for his dinner. About _ten_ he generally blows his\r\nnose and cuts his toe-nails; and while he takes the exercise of his\r\n_bidet_, Dr. PRETTYMAN reads to him the different petitions and\r\nmemorials that have been presented to him. About _eleven_ his valet\r\nbrings in Mr. ATKINSON and a WARM SHIRT, and they talk over the _New\r\nScrip_, and other matters of finance. Mr. ATKINSON has said to _his_\r\nconfidential friends round 'Change, that Mr. PITT always speaks to him\r\nwith great affability. At _twelve_ Mr. PITT retires to a water-closet,\r\nadjoining to which is a small cabinet, from whence Mr. JENKINSON\r\nconfers with him on the secret instructions from BUCKINGHAM-HOUSE.\r\nAfter this, Mr. PITT takes a long lesson of dancing; and Mr. GALLINI\r\nsays, that if he did not turn in his toes, and hold down his head,\r\nhe would be a very good dancer. At _two_ Mr. WILBERFORCE comes in,\r\nand they both play with Mr. PITT's black dog, whom they are very\r\nfond of, because he is like Lord MULGRAVE in the face, and barks out\r\nof time to the organs that pass in the street. After this Mr. PITT\r\nrides. We are credibly informed, that he often pats his horse; and,\r\nindeed, he is remarkably fond of all _dumb creatures_ both in and out\r\nof Parliament. At _four_ he sleeps.--Mr. PITT eats very heartily,\r\ndrinks one bottle of port, and two when he _speaks_; so that we may\r\nhope that Great Britain will long be blessed with the superintendance\r\nof this virtuous and able young Minister!!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM A NEW MEMBER TO HIS FRIEND IN THE COUNTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nAs you are so anxious and inquisitive to know the principal\r\ncircumstances that have occurred to my observation, since my\r\nintroduction to the House of Commons, I think it my duty to give\r\nyou what satisfaction I am able. As you know, my dear friend,\r\nhow little I dreamt of being called out of my humble sphere of life,\r\nto the rank of a senator (and still less at a time when so many\r\nconsiderable gentlemen of education, worth, and property had been\r\ndriven from their seats in Parliament), you will not wonder that it\r\nrequired some time before I could rid myself of the awe and\r\nembarrassment that I felt on first entering the walls of that\r\naugust assembly. Figure to yourself, my good Sir, how very aukward\r\nand distressing it was to me to reflect, that I was now become\r\na member of the British Senate; picked and culled out, as our\r\ninimitable Premier assured us, by the free, unbiassed voice of\r\nthe people, for our singular abilities and love of our country,\r\nto represent the wisdom of the nation at the present critical\r\njuncture. Would to God I possessed a pen that might enable me to\r\ncelebrate, in a style equal to his merits, the praises of this prodigy\r\nof a Minister, whom I can never speak or think of without enthusiasm!\r\nOh! had you but heard his speech on the day of our meeting, when he\r\naddressed himself to the young members in a strain of eloquence\r\nthat could not fail to make a lasting impression on our minds!\r\nNot one of us, I assure you, who did not feel the warmest emotions\r\nof respect and gratitude, and begin to entertain a confidence in his\r\nown talents for business, and a consciousness of his zeal for\r\nthe public service, that would probably have never entered into\r\nthe head of a simple individual, if this excellent young man had\r\nnot condescended to point out to us those qualities in such strong\r\nand flattering colours.\r\n\r\nSuch extraordinary marks of condescension surprized me not a little,\r\nfrom a person whom I had been used to hear so generally (but no doubt\r\nmost falsely) censured, for upstart pretension and overbearing\r\narrogance; and I could not sufficiently admire the candour he shewed,\r\nin giving such perfect credit to the talents and virtues of so many\r\nstrangers, the greatest part of whose faces were even unknown to him.\r\nBesides, the compliment appeared to me the more generous, as I had but\r\nthat very morning received a promise from Government to refund me\r\nthe heavy charges and trouble they had led me into at my late\r\nelection, which you very well know, notwithstanding the help of Mr.\r\nROBINSON, had very near ruined my affairs, and proved the destruction\r\nof myself and family.\r\n\r\nAs you desire to have my impartial sentiments respecting the eloquence\r\nof Mr. PITT and Mr. FOX, I must fairly own, that I cannot hear,\r\nwithout indignation,  any comparison made between 'em;--and,\r\nI assure you, Mr. PITT has a very decided preference in the opinion\r\nof most of the new members, especially among us COUNTRY GENTLEMEN,\r\nwho, though we never heard any thing like public speaking before\r\nin our lives, have too much sense and spirit to agree in this\r\nparticular with the generality of the public.--We could all see\r\nMr. PITT was an orator in a moment. The dignity of his deportment,\r\nwhen he first rises from the Treasury Bench, with his head and\r\neyes erect, and arms extended, the regular poize of the same action\r\nthroughout the whole of his speech, the equal pitch of his voice,\r\nwhich is full as sonorous and emphatic in expressions of the least\r\nweight; above all, his words, which are his principal excellence,\r\nand are really finer and longer than can be conceived, and clearly\r\nprove him, in my judgment, to be far superior to every other orator.\r\nMr. FOX, it seems, in perfect despair of imitating the expression\r\nand manner of his rival, never attempts to soar above a language\r\nthat is perfectly plain, obvious, and intelligible, to the meanest\r\nunderstanding; whereas, I give you my word, I have more than once\r\nmet with several who have frankly owned to me, that Mr. PITT's\r\neloquence was often above their capacity to comprehend. In addition\r\nto this, it is observable, that Mr. PITT has the happy art of\r\nexpressing himself, even upon the most trifling occasion, in\r\nat least three times as many words as any other person uses in\r\nan argument of the utmost importance, which is so evident an advantage\r\nover all his adversaries, that I wonder they persist to engage in\r\nso unequal a combat.\r\n\r\nI shall take an early opportunity of communicating to you some\r\nfurther observations on this subject: in the mean time believe me,\r\n\r\n                                  Dear Sir,\r\n                                      With the truest regard,\r\n                                          Your's, &c. &c. &c.\r\n_Cocoa Tree, May_ 29, 1784.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE\r\nPOLITICAL RECEIPT BOOK,\r\nFOR THE YEAR 1784.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO MAKE A PREMIER.\r\n\r\nTake a man with a great quantity of that sort of words which produce\r\nthe greatest effect upon the _many_, and the least upon the _few_:\r\nmix them with a large portion of affected candour and ingenuousness,\r\nintroduced in a haughty and contemptuous manner. Let there be a great\r\nabundance of falsehood, concealed under an apparent disinterestedness\r\nand integrity; and the two last to be the most professed when\r\nthe former is most practised. Let his engagements and declarations,\r\nhowever solemnly made, be broken and disregarded, if he thinks he can\r\nprocure afterwards a popular indemnity for illegality and deceit.\r\nHe must subscribe to the doctrine of PASSIVE OBEDIENCE, and to\r\nthe exercise of patronage independent of his approbation; and be\r\ncareless of creating the most formidable enemies, if he can gratify\r\nthe personal revenge and hatred of those who employ him, even at\r\nthe expence of public ruin and general confusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO MAKE A SECRETARY OF STATE.\r\n\r\nTake a man in a violent passion, or a man that never has been in one;\r\nbut the first is the best. Let him be concerned in making an\r\nignominious peace, the articles of which he could not comprehend,\r\nand cannot explain. Let him speak loud, and yet never be heard;\r\nand to be the kind of man for a SECRETARY OF STATE when nobody else\r\nwill accept it.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO MAKE A PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL.\r\n\r\nTake a man who all his life loved office, merely for its emolument;\r\nand when measures which he had approved were eventually unfortunate,\r\nlet him be notorious for relinquishing his share of the responsibility\r\nof them; and be stigmatized, for political courage in the period\r\nof prosperity, and for cowardice when there exists but the appearance\r\nof danger.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO MAKE A CHANCELLOR.\r\n\r\nTake a man of great abilities, with a heart as black as his\r\ncountenance. Let him possess a rough inflexibility, without\r\nthe least tincture of generosity or affection, and be as manly\r\nas oaths and ill manners can make him. He should be a man who\r\nwill act politically with all parties, hating and deriding every\r\none of the individuals which compose them.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO MAKE A MASTER OF THE ORDNANCE.\r\n\r\nTake a man of a busy, meddling, turn of mind, with just as much parts\r\nas will make him troublesome, but never respectable. Let him be\r\nso perfectly callous to a sense of personal honour, and to the\r\ndistinction of public fame, as to be marked for the valour of\r\ninsulting where it cannot be revenged[1]; and, if a case should\r\narise, where he attempts to injure reputation, because it is dignified\r\nand absent, he should possess _discretion_ enough to apologise and\r\nto recant, if it is afterwards dictated to him to do so,\r\nnotwithstanding any previously-declared resolutions to the contrary.\r\nSuch a man will be found to be the most fit for servitude in times of\r\ndisgrace and degradation.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO MAKE A TREASURER OF THE NAVY.\r\n\r\nTake a man, composed of most of the ingredients necessary to enable\r\nhim to attack and defend the very same principles in politics, or\r\nany party or parties concerned in them, at all times, and upon all\r\noccasions. Mix with these ingredients a very large quantity of\r\nthe root of interest, so that the juice of it may be always sweet\r\nand uppermost. Let him be one who avows a pride in being so necessary\r\nan instrument for every political measure, as to be able to extort\r\nthose honours and emoluments from the weakness of a government, which\r\nhe had been deliberately refused, at a time when it would have been\r\nhonourable to have obtained them.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO MAKE A LORD OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\nTake the most stupid man you can find, but who can make his signature;\r\nand from ignorance in _every thing_ will never contradict you in\r\n_any thing_. He should not have a brother in the church, for if he\r\nhas, he will most probably abandon or betray you. Or, take a man of\r\nfashion, with any sort of celebrity: if he has accustomed himself to\r\narguments, though the dullness can only be measured by the length of\r\nthem, he will serve to speak _against time_, with a certainty in that\r\ncase of never being answered.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO MAKE A SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\nTake a pleading _Country Attorney_, without passion, and without\r\nparts. Let him be one who will seize the first opportunity of\r\nrenouncing his connection with the first man who draws him out of\r\nobscurity and serves him. If he has no affections or friendships, so\r\nmuch the better; he will be more ready to contribute to his own\r\nadvantage. He should be of a temper so pliable, and a perseverance so\r\nineffectual, as to lead his master into troubles, difficulties, and\r\nruin, when he thinks he is labouring to overcome them. Let him be a\r\nman, who has cunning enough, at the same time, to prey upon and\r\ndeceive frankness and confidence; and who, when he can no longer avail\r\nhimself of both, will sacrifice even his character in the cause of\r\ntreachery, and prefer the interests resulting from it, to the virtuous\r\ndistinctions of honour and gratitude.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO MAKE A SECRETARY-AT-WAR.\r\n\r\nTake a man that will take any thing. Let him possess all the negative\r\nvirtues of being able to do no harm, but at the same time can do no\r\ngood; for they are qualifications of a courtly nature, and may in time\r\nrecommend him to a situation something worse, or something better.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO MAKE AN ATTORNEY-GENERAL.\r\n\r\nTake a little ugly man, with an _eye_ to his preferment. It is not\r\nrequisite that he should be much of a lawyer, provided that he be a\r\ntolerable politician; but in order to qualify himself for an _English\r\nJudge_, he should first be a _Welch_ one. He must have docility\r\nsufficient to do any thing; and, if a period should arrive, when power\r\nhas popularity enough to make rules and laws for the evident purpose\r\nof gratifying malignity, he should be one who should be ready to\r\nadvise or consent to the creation of new cases, and be able to defend\r\nnew remedies for them, though they militate against every principle\r\nof reason, equity, and justice.\r\n\r\nN.B. The greatest part of this Receipt would make a MASTER OF THE\r\nROLLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO MAKE A WARDROBE-KEEPER, OR PRIVY-PURSE.\r\n\r\nTake the most supercilious fool in the nation, and let him be in\r\nconfidence in proportion to his ignorance.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO MAKE A SURVEYOR-GENERAL OF THE ORDNANCE.\r\n\r\nTake a Captain in the _Navy_, as being best acquainted with the\r\n_Army_; he should have been a few years _at sea_, in order to qualify\r\nhim for the direction of works _on shore_; and let him be one who will\r\nsacrifice his connections with as much ease as he would renounce\r\nhis profession.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO MAKE A PEER.\r\n\r\nTake a man, with or without parts, of an ancient or a new family, with\r\none or with two Boroughs at his command, previous to a dissolution.\r\nLet him renounce all former professions and obligations, and engage\r\nto bring in your friends, and to support you himself. Or, take\r\nthe Country Gentleman who the least expects it; and particularly\r\nlet the honour be conferred when he has done nothing to deserve it.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO MAKE SECRET INFLUENCE.\r\n\r\nTake a tall, ill-looking man, with more vanity, and less reason\r\nfor it, than any person in Europe. He should be one who does not\r\npossess a single consolatory private virtue, under a general public\r\ndetestation. His pride and avarice should increase with his\r\nprosperity, while they lead him to neglect and despise the natural\r\nclaims of indigence in his own family. If such a man can be found, he\r\nwill easily be made the instigator, as well as the instrument, of a\r\ncabal, which has the courage to do mischief, and the cowardice of not\r\nbeing responsible for it; convinced that he can never obtain any other\r\nimportance, than that to be derived from the execution of purposes\r\nevidently pursued for the establishment of tyranny upon the wreck\r\nof public ruin.\r\n\r\n[1] \"What care I for the King's Birth-day!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHINTS\r\nFROM DR. PRETTYMAN, THE COMMIS, TO THE PREMIER'S PORTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo admit Mr. WILBERFORCE, although Mr. PITT should be even engaged\r\nwith the SOUTHWARK agents,  fabricating means to defeat Sir RICHARD\r\nHOTHAM.--WILBE must have _two_ bows.--ATKINSON to be shewn into the\r\nanti-chamber--he will find amusement in reading LAZARRELLO DE TORMEZ,\r\nor the _complete Rogue_.--If Lord APSLEY and Mr. PERCIVAL come from\r\nthe Admiralty, they may be ushered into the room where the large\r\n_looking-glasses_ are fixed--in that case they will not regret\r\nwaiting--Don't let LORD MAHON be detained an instant at the door, the\r\npregnant young lady opposite having been sufficiently frightened\r\nalready!!!--JACK ROBINSON to be shewn into the study, as the private\r\npapers were all removed this morning--Let Lord LONSDALE have _my\r\nLord_, and _your Lordship_, repeated to his ear as often as\r\npossible--the apartment hung with _garter-blue_ is proper for his\r\nreception!--The other new Peers to be greeted only plain _Sir!_ that\r\nthey may remember their late _ignobility_, and feel new gratitude to\r\nthe _benefactor of honours!_--You may, as if upon recollection,\r\naddress some of the last list, _My Lord!_--and ask their names--it\r\nwill be pleasing to them to sound out their own titles.--Lord ELIOT is\r\nto be an exception, as he will tediously go through every degree of\r\nhis dignity in giving an answer.--All letters from BERKELEY-SQUARE\r\nto be brought in without mentioning Lord SHELBURNE's name, or even\r\nMr. ROSE's.--The Treasury Messenger to carry the _red box_, as usual,\r\nto CHARLES JENKINSON before it is sent to Buckingham-House.--Don't\r\nblunder a second time, and question Lord MOUNTMORRES as to the life\r\nof a _hackney chairman_ - it is wrong to judge by appearances!--Lord\r\nGRAHAM may be admitted to the library - he can't read, and therefore\r\nwon't derange the books.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA TALE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  At BROOKES's once, it so fell out,\r\n  The box was push'd with glee about;\r\n  With mirth reciprocal inflam'd,\r\n  'Twas said they rather play'd than gam'd;\r\n  A general impulse through them ran,\r\n  And seem'd t' actuate every man:\r\n  But as all human pleasures tend\r\n  At some sad moment to an end,\r\n  The hour at last approach'd, when lo!\r\n  'Twas time tor every one to go.\r\n  Now for the first time it was seen,\r\n  A certain sum unown'd had been;\r\n  To no man's spot directly fixt,\r\n  But plac'd--ambiguously betwixt:\r\n  So doubtfully indeed it lay,\r\n  That none with confidence could say\r\n  This cash is mine--I'm certain on't--\r\n  But most declined with--\"Sir, I won't\"--\r\n  \"I can't in conscience urge a right,\r\n  To what I am not certain quite.\"\r\n  --NORTHUMBRIA'S DUKE, who wish'd to put\r\n  An end to this polite dispute,\r\n  Whose generous nature yearn'd to see\r\n  The smallest seeds of enmity,\r\n  Arose and said--\"this cash is mine--                }\r\n  For being ask'd to-day to dine,                     }\r\n  You see I'm furbelow'd and fine,                    }\r\n  With full-made sleeves and pendant lace;\r\n  Rely on't, this was just the case,\r\n  That when by chance my arm I mov'd,\r\n  The money from me then I shov'd;\r\n  This clearly shews how it was shifted,\"\r\n  Thus said, the rhino then he lifted;--\r\n  \"Hold, hold, my Lord,\" says thoughtless HARE,\r\n  Who never made his purse his care;\r\n  A man who thought that money's use\r\n  Was real comfort to produce,\r\n  And all the pleasures scorn'd to know\r\n  Which from its _snug_ enjoyments flow;\r\n  Such as still charm their gladden'd eyes,\r\n  Who feel the bliss of avarice.\r\n  \"Hold, hold, my Lord, how is it known\r\n  This cash is certainly your own?\r\n  We each might urge as good a plea,\r\n  Or WYNDHAM, CRAUFURD, SMITH, or me;\r\n  But we, though less it were to blame,\r\n  Disdain'd so pitiful a claim;\r\n  Then here let me be arbitrator--\r\n  I vote the money to the waiter,\"\r\n  Thus oft will generous folly think:\r\n  But prudence parts not so with chink.\r\n  On this occasion so it was,\r\n  For gravely thus my Lord Duke says:\r\n  \"Consider, Sir, how large the sum,\r\n  To full eight guineas it will come:\r\n  Shall I, for your quaint verbal play,\r\n  Consign a whole estate away?\r\n  Unjust, ridiculous, absurd,\r\n  I will not do it, on my word;\r\n  Yet rather than let fools deride,\r\n  I give my _fiat_ to divide;\r\n  So 'twixt the waiter and myself,\r\n  Place equal portions of the pelf;\r\n  Thus eighty shillings give to RALPH,\r\n  To ALNWICK's DUKE the other half.\"\r\n  HARE and the rest (unthinking croud!)\r\n  At this decision laugh'd aloud:\r\n  \"Sneer if you like,\" exclaim'd the Duke,\r\n  Then to himself his portion took;\r\n  And spite of all the witless rakes,\r\n  The Peer and Porter part the stakes.\r\n\r\n\r\nMORALS.\r\n\r\n  I.

when they arose in the morning, they were all dead\r\ncorpses!_\"\r\n\r\nHIGH BAILIFF.--But for God's sake, good Sir, in that case, what will\r\nthe people justly say of _me?_\r\n\r\nCURATE.--\"_Let a gallows be erected fifty cubits high, and to-morrow\r\nspeak unto the King, that_ MORDECAI _may be hanged thereon!_\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPARAGRAPH-OFFICE, IVY-LANE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhereas by public orders from this office, all GENTLEMEN RUNNERS and\r\nSCRIBBLERS, PUNNERS and QUIBBLERS, PUFFERS, PLAISTERERS, DAUBERS and\r\nSPATTERERS, in our pay, and under our direction, were required, for\r\nreasons therein specified, to be particularly diligent in defending\r\nand enforcing the projected DUTY ON COALS.\r\n\r\nAND WHEREAS the virtuous and illustrious CHANCELLOR OR THE EXCHEQUER,\r\npatriotically resolving to prefer the private interests of his friends\r\nto the public distress of his enemies; and prudently preferring the\r\nfriendship of Lord LONSDALE to the satisfaction of ruining the\r\nmanufactures of IRELAND, has accordingly signified in the HOUSE OF\r\nCOMMONS, that he intends to propose some other tax as a substitute\r\nfor the said duty.\r\n\r\nTHIS IS TO GIVE NOTICE to all Gentlemen Runners, and Scribblers, as\r\naforesaid, that they hold themselves ready to furnish, agreeably to\r\nour future orders, a sufficient number of panegyrical paragraphs,\r\nproperly ornamented with _Italics_ and CAPITALS, notes of\r\ninterrogation, and notes of admiration, apostrophe's and exclamations,\r\nin support of any tax whatever, which the young Minister in his wisdom\r\nmay think proper to substitute. AND in the mean time that they fail\r\nnot to urge the public spirit and zeal for the national welfare,\r\nhumanity to the poor, and regard for the prosperity of our\r\nmanufacturers, which considerations ALONE induced the Minister to\r\nabandon his original purpose of taxing coals: AND that they expatiate\r\non the wise exemptions and regulations which the Minister would\r\ncertainly have introduced into his bill for enacting the said tax, but\r\nthat (as he declared in the House of Commons) unfortunately for the\r\nfinances of this country, he had not time in the present Session of\r\nParliament to devise such exemptions and regulations: AND FINALLY,\r\nthat they boldly assert the said tax to have been GOOD, POLITIC, JUST,\r\nand EQUITABLE; but that the new tax, which is to be substituted in\r\nplace of it, will necessarily be BETTER, MORE POLITIC, MORE JUST, and\r\nMORE EQUITABLE.\r\n\r\n                                                          MAC-OSSIAN,\r\n                               _Superintendent-general of the Press._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPITT AND PINETTI. A PARALLEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIGNOR PINETTI the Conjuror, and Mr. PITT the Premier, have a\r\nwonderful similitude in the principal transactions and events by\r\nwhich they are distinguished.\r\n\r\nPINETTI, in defiance of Mr. COLMAN, took possession of his property\r\nin the HAYMARKET THEATRE, and by the help of a little agency behind\r\nthe scenes, played several tricks, and became popular!\r\n\r\nMr. PITT in like manner seized upon another THEATRE-ROYAL, in the\r\nabsence of the rightful possessor, the Duke of PORTLAND. He had not,\r\nit is true, the permission of a LORD CHAMBERLAIN as PINETTI had; but\r\nthe countenance of a LORD OF THE BEDCHAMBER was deemed equivalent.\r\nHere he exhibited several surprising tricks and deceptions: we will\r\nsay nothing of the agency, but all present appeared delighted. PINETTI\r\nalso exhibited in the presence of Royalty, and with equal success,\r\nas the sign manual he boasts of will testify.\r\n\r\nPINETTI cuts a lemon in two, and shews a KNAVE OF DIAMONDS--Mr. PITT\r\nin like manner can divide the HOUSE OF COMMONS, which for its acidity\r\nmay be called the political lemon. He cannot at present shew a KNAVE\r\nOF DIAMONDS; but what may he not do when Mr. HASTINGS arrives?[1]\r\n\r\nPINETTI takes a number of rings, he fastens them together, and\r\nproduces a CHAIN.--Does any person dispute Mr. PITT's ability to\r\nconstruct a CHAIN?\r\n\r\nPINETTI has a SYMPATHETIC LIGHT, which he extinguishes at command--Mr.\r\nPITT's method of leaving us in the dark is by BLOCKING UP our WINDOWS!\r\n\r\nPINETTI takes money out of one's pocket in defiance of all the\r\ncaution that can be used--Mr. PITT does the same, without returning\r\nit.--In this the Minister differs from the Conjuror!\r\n\r\nPINETTI attempted to strip off an Englishman's shirt; if he had\r\nsucceeded, he would have retained his popularity.--Mr. PITT attempted\r\nthis trick, and has carried his point.\r\n\r\nPINETTI has a bird which sings exactly any tune put before it.--Mr.\r\nPITT has upwards of TWO HUNDRED birds of this description.--N.B.\r\nPEARSON says they are a pack of CHATTERING MAGPIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The Editor feels it necessary to declare, in justice to Mr.\r\nHASTINGS's character, that the charges since preferred by the HOUSE\r\nOF COMMONS, and MAJOR SCOTT's _honour as a Gentleman_, have amply\r\ndisproved all parts of this comparison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW ABSTRACT\r\nOF THE\r\nBUDGET,\r\nFOR 1784.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMUTATION TAX.--An Act for rendering houses more chearful, healthy,\r\ncomfortable, and commodious.\r\n\r\nPAPER DITTO.--An Act for the encouragement of authors, the promotion\r\nof learning, and extending the liberty of the press.\r\n\r\nPOSTAGE DITTO.--An Act for expediting business, increasing social\r\nintercourse, and facilitating the epistolary correspondence of\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nDISTILLERY DITTO.--An Act for making the landlords responsible to\r\ngovernment for the obedience of their own and their neighbours\r\ntenantry.\r\n\r\nCANDLE DITTO.--An Act for the benevolent purpose of putting the\r\nblind on a level with their fellow-creatures.\r\n\r\nEXCISE GOODS DITTO.--An Act for lessening the burthen of the subject\r\nby an increase of the collection.\r\n\r\nSOAP DITTO.--An Act for suppressing the effeminacy of Englishmen,\r\nby disappointing them of clean linen.\r\n\r\nSMUGGLING DITTO.--An Act for demonstrating the arbitrary spirit\r\nof this free government, in whatever clashes with the interests\r\nof the Treasury.\r\n\r\nGAME DITTO.--An Act for making the many responsible, for a monopoly\r\nof every thing nice and delicate, to the palates of the few.\r\n\r\nHORSE DITTO.--An Act for reducing the farmers to the wholesome\r\nexercise of walking, while their servants enfeeble themselves\r\nwith riding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEATRICAL INTELLIGENCE EXTRAORDINARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the last grand FETE given by Mr. JENKINSON to his friends in\r\nAdministration, it was proposed, that as WILBERFORCE had sprained\r\nhis leg at the last game at LEAPFROG, and PRATT had grown too fat\r\nfor their old favourite sport of HIDE-AND-SEEK, some new diversion\r\nshould be instituted.--Various _succedanea_ were suggested, such as\r\nCHUCK-FARTHING, MARBLES, &c. but at last the general voice determined\r\nin favour of the DRAMA.--After some little altercation as to what\r\nparticular dramatic production to select, the comic opera of TOM JONES\r\nwas performed, and the arrangement of characters was disposed of\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n  DRAMATIS PERSONÆ.\r\n  BLIFIL,       -      -       MR PITT.\r\n  BLACK GEORGE,       -        MR. ROBINSON.\r\n  KING OF THE GYPSIES,    -    LORD THURLOW.\r\n  THWACKAM,          -         MR. JENKINSON.\r\n  SQUARE,      -       -       DR. PRETTYMAN.\r\n  SQUIRE WESTERN,      -       MR. ROLLE.\r\n  PARTRIDGE,      -     -      MR. MACPHERSON.\r\n\r\nThe parts of ALLWORTHY, TOM JONES, and SOPHIA, were subjects of long\r\nand difficult discussion; but at length Mr. DUNDAS put an end to the\r\naltercation, by assuring the company that he was willing and able to\r\nact ANY part, and would be glad, though at so short a notice, to\r\nattempt that of ALLWORTHY. The same offer was handsomely made by\r\nLord DENBIGH for that of TOM JONES, and the character of SOPHIA was\r\nat last allotted to VILLIERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE\r\nWESTMINSTER GUIDE.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESSED TO MR.

what follies to chide!\r\n  Oh! how we all long for a WESTMINSTER Guide!\r\n  First, in judgment decisive, as OTTOMAN Califf,\r\n  Aloft on the hustings, behold the HIGH BAILIFF!\r\n  But we miss from the seat, where law rests on a word,\r\n  The old symbols of justice--the scales and the sword--\r\n  As a symbol too martial the sword he discards,\r\n  So 'tis lodg'd where it suits--in the hands of the guards;\r\n  And doubting the poise of weak hands like his own,\r\n  He suspended the scales at the foot of the throne.----\r\n\r\n  Turn next to the candidates--at such a crisis--\r\n  We've a right to observe on their virtues or vices.\r\n  Hood founds (and with justice to most apprehensions)\r\n  In years of fair services, manly pretensions;\r\n  But his party to change, and his friend to betray,\r\n  By some are held better pretensions in WRAY.\r\n\r\n  For the third, if at Court we his character scan,\r\n  A dæmon incarnate is poor CARLO KHAN;\r\n  Catch his name when afloat on convivial bumpers,\r\n  Or sent up to the skies by processions of plumpers;\r\n  He is Freedom's defender, the champion of Right,\r\n  The Man of the People, the nation's delight.\r\n  To party or passion we scorn to appeal,\r\n  Nor want we the help of intemperate zeal;\r\n  Let Time from Detraction have rescued his cause,\r\n  And our verse shall but echo a nation's applause.\r\n\r\n  But hark! proclamation and silence intreated;\r\n  The inspectors arranged--the polling clerks seated--\r\n  With Bibles in hand, to purge willing and loth,\r\n  With the Catholic Test, and the Bribery Oath.\r\n  In clamour and tumult mobs thicken around,\r\n  And for one voice to vote there are ten to confound:\r\n  St. GILES's with WAPPING unites Garretteers,\r\n  HOOD and WRAY and PREROGATIVE, PITT and three cheers!\r\n  'Tis the day for the Court--the grand Treasury push!\r\n  And the pack of that kennel well trained to the _brush_,\r\n  Dash noisy and fearless through thick and through thin,\r\n  The huntsman unseen, but his friends whippers-in.\r\n\r\n  Now follow fresh tribes, scarce a man worth a louse,\r\n  Till put into plight at NORTHUMBERLAND HOUSE;\r\n  Ten poll for one mansion, each proving he keeps it,\r\n  And one for each chimney--he'll prove that he sweeps it--\r\n  With these mix the great, on rights equally fables,\r\n  Great Peers from poor lodgings, great Lawyers from stables;\r\n  Ev'n the Soldier, whose household's a centinel box.\r\n  Claims a questionless franchise 'gainst Freedom and FOX;\r\n  All dubbed and maintained upon influence regal\r\n  Of the new H----E of C------S constituents legal.\r\n\r\n  What troops too of females 'mong'st CHARLES's opposers?\r\n  Old tabbies and gossips, scolds, gigglers, and sprosers!\r\n  And Lady LACKPENSION, and Dowager THRIFTY,\r\n  And many a maiden the wrong side of fifty;\r\n  And FUBZY, with flesh and with flabbiness laden\r\n  (And in all things indeed the reverse of a maiden),\r\n  And hags after hags join the barbarous din,\r\n  More hateful than serpents, more ugly than SIN.\r\n\r\n  Thus [1] the Bacchanal tribes when they ORPHEUS assailed,\r\n  Drowned his notes with their yells ere their vengeance prevailed,\r\n  Well knowing the sound of his voice or his lyre,\r\n  Had charms to allay diabolical ire.\r\n  Our Bacchanals find a more difficult foe;\r\n  For what strains can inchant, though from ORPHEUS they flow,\r\n  Like the orator's spell o'er the patriot mind,\r\n  When pleading to reason the cause of mankind?\r\n\r\n  Now for councils more secret that govern the plan--\r\n  _A Calif is nothing without a_ DIVAN.\r\n  With invisible step let us steal on the quorum,\r\n  Where MAINWARING sits in the Chair of Decorum.\r\n  And WILMOT harangues to the brethren elect,\r\n  [2]On his master's commands--\"Carry law to effect.\"\r\n  \"The true reading, my friends, in the _jus bacculinum_,\r\n  When the FOXITES are drubbed, then imprison or fine 'em;\r\n  And let him who would construe th' effective still further,\r\n  Knock out a friend's brains to accuse them of murder.\r\n  I have ready some hundreds of resolute knaves,\r\n  With bludgeons well shaped into Constables' staves,\r\n  In WESTMINSTER strangers--true creatures of power,\r\n  Like the lions--ferociously nursed at the Tower[3].\r\n  Do we want more support?--Mark!

HAYLEY.\r\n\r\n  To thy candour now, HAYLEY, I offer the line,\r\n  Which after thy model I fain would refine.\r\n  Thy skill, in each trial of melody sweeter,\r\n  Can to elegant themes adapt frolicksome metre;\r\n  And at will, with a comic or tender controul,\r\n  Now speak to the humour, and now to the soul.\r\n  We'll turn from the objects of satire and spleen,\r\n  That late, uncontrasted; disfigured the scene;\r\n  To WRAY leave the rage the defeated attends,\r\n  And the conqueror hail in the arms of his friends;\r\n  Count with emulous zeal the selected and true,\r\n  Enroll in the list, and the triumph pursue.\r\n  These are friendships that bloomed in the morning of life,\r\n  Those were grafted on thorns midst political strife;\r\n  Alike they matured from the stem, or the flower,\r\n  Unblighted by int'rest, unshaken by power.\r\n  Bright band! to whose feelings in constancy tried,\r\n  Disfavour is glory, oppression is pride;\r\n  Attached to his fortunes, and fond of his fame,\r\n  Vicissitudes pass but to shew you the same.\r\n\r\n  But whence this fidelity, new to the age?\r\n  Can parts, though sublime, such attachments engage?\r\n  No: the dazzle of parts may the passions allure,\r\n  'Tis the heart of the friend makes affections endure.\r\n  The heart that intent on all worth but its own,\r\n  Assists every talent, and arrogates none;\r\n  The feeble protects, as it honours the brave,\r\n  Expands to the just, and hates only the knave.\r\n\r\n  These are honours, my FOX, that are due to thy deeds;\r\n  But lo! yet a brighter alliance succeeds;\r\n  The alliance of beauty in lustre of youth,\r\n  That shines on thy cause with the radiance of truth.\r\n  The conviction they feel the fair zealots impart,\r\n  And the eloquent eye sends it home to the heart.\r\n  Each glance has the touch of Ithuriel's spear,\r\n  That no art can withstand, no delusion can bear,\r\n  And the effort of malice and lie of the day,\r\n  Detected and scorn'd, break like vapour away.\r\n\r\n  Avaunt, ye profane! the fair pageantry moves:\r\n  An entry of VENUS, led on by the loves!\r\n  Behold how the urchins round DEVONSHIRE press!\r\n  For order, submissive, her eyes they address:\r\n  She assumes her command with a diffident smile,\r\n  And leads, thus attended, the pride of the Isle.\r\n\r\n  Oh! now for the pencil of GUIDO! to trace,\r\n  Of KEPPEL the features, of WALDEGRAVES the grace;\r\n  Of FITZROY the bloom the May morning to vie,\r\n  Of SEFTON the air, of DUNCANNON the eye;\r\n  Of LOFTUS the smiles (though with preference proud,\r\n  She gives ten to her husband, for one to the croud),\r\n  Of PORTLAND the manner, that steals on the breast,\r\n  But is too much her own to be caught or express'd;\r\n  The charms that with sentiment BOUVERIE blends,\r\n  The fairest of forms and the truest of friends;\r\n  The look that in WARBURTON, humble and chaste,\r\n  Speaks candour and truth, and discretion and taste;\r\n  Or with equal expression in HORTON combined,\r\n  Vivacity's dimples with reason refined.\r\n\r\n  REYNOLDS, haste to my aid, for a figure divine,\r\n  Where the pencil of GUIDO has yielded to thine;\r\n  Bear witness the canvas where SHERIDAN lives,\r\n  And with angels, the lovely competitor, strives----\r\n  While Earth claims her beauty and Heaven her strain,\r\n  Be it mine to adore ev'ry link of the chain!\r\n\r\n  But new claimants appear ere the lyre is unstrung,\r\n  Can PAYNE be passed by? Shall not MILNER be sung?\r\n  See DELME and HOWARD, a favourite pair,\r\n  For grace of both classes, the zealous and fair----\r\n  A verse for MORANT, like her wit may it please,\r\n  Another for BRADDYLL of elegant ease,\r\n  For BAMFYLDE a simile worthy her frame----\r\n  Quick, quick--I have yet half a hundred to name----\r\n  Not PARNASSUS in concert could answer the call,\r\n  Nor multiplied muses do justice to all.\r\n\r\n  Then follow the throng where with festal delight,\r\n  More pleasing than HEBE, CREWE opens the night.\r\n  Not the goblet nectareous of welcome and joy,\r\n  That DIDO prepared for the hero of TROY;\r\n  Not Fiction, describing the banquets above,\r\n  Where goddesses mix at the table of JOVE;\r\n  Could afford to the soul more ambrosial cheer\r\n  Than attends on the fairer associates here.\r\n  But CREWE, with a mortal's distinction content,\r\n  Bounds her claim to the rites of this happy event;\r\n  For the hero to twine civic garlands of fame,\r\n  With the laurel and rose interweaving his name,\r\n  And while Iö Pæans his merits avow,\r\n  As the Queen of the feast, place the wreath on his brow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINSCRIPTION\r\n\r\n\r\n_For the_ DUKE OF RICHMOND'_s Bust to the Memory of the\r\nlate_ MARQUIS OF ROCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n  Hail, marble! happy in a double end!\r\n  Raised to departed principles and friend:\r\n  The friend once gone, no principles would stay:\r\n  For very grief, they wept themselves away!\r\n  Let no harsh censure such conjunction blame,\r\n  Since join'd in life, their fates should be the same.\r\n  Therefore from death they feel a common sting,\r\n  And HEAV'N receives the one, and one the K--G.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEPIGRAM.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Reason for Mr._ FOX'_s avowed contempt of one_ PIGOT'_s Address to\r\nhim._\r\n\r\n  Who shall expect the country's friend,\r\n    The darling of the House,\r\n  Should for a moment condescend\r\n    To crack a [1]PRISON LOUSE.\r\n\r\nANOTHER.\r\n\r\n_On one_ PIGOT'_s being called a_ LOUSE.\r\n\r\n  PIGOT is a _Louse_, they say,\r\n    But if you kick him, you will _see_,\r\n  'Tis by much the truest way,\r\n    To represent him as a FLEA.\r\n\r\nANOTHER,\r\n\r\n  For servile meanness to the great,\r\n    Let none hold PIGOT Cheap;\r\n  Who can resist his destined fate?\r\n    A LOUSE must always CREEP.\r\n\r\nANOTHER.\r\n\r\n  PIGOT is sure a most courageous man,\r\n  \"A word and blow\" for ever is his plan;\r\n  And thus his friends explain the curious matter,\r\n  He gives the first, and then receives the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The substantive in the marked part of this line has been long an\r\nestablished SYNONYME for Mr. PIGOT, and the PREDICATE, we are assured,\r\nis not at this time less just.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEW BALLAD,\r\nENTITLED AND CALLED\r\nBILLY EDEN,\r\nOR, THE\r\nRENEGADO SCOUT.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Tune of_ ALLY CROAKER.\r\n\r\n  I.\r\n  There lived a man at BECKHAM, in KENT, Sir,\r\n  Who wanted a place to make him content, Sir;\r\n  Long had he sigh'd for BILLY PITT's protection,\r\n  When thus he gently courted his affection:\r\n    Will you give a place, my dearest BILLY PITT _O!_\r\n    If I can't have a whole one, oh! give a little bit _O!_\r\n\r\n  II.\r\n  He pimp'd with GEORGE ROSE, he lied with the DOCTOR,\r\n  He flatter'd Mrs. HASTINGS 'till almost he had shock'd her;\r\n  He got the ARCHBISHOP to write in his favour,\r\n  And when BILLY gets a beard, he swears he'll be his shaver.\r\n    Then give him a place, oh! dearest BILLY PITT _O!_\r\n    If he can't have a whole one, oh! give a little bit _O!_\r\n\r\n  III.\r\n  To all you young men, who are famous for changing,\r\n  From party to party continually ranging,\r\n  I tell you the place of all places to breed in,\r\n  For maggots of corruption's the heart of BILLY EDEN.\r\n    Then give him a place, oh! dearest BILLY PITT _O!_\r\n    If he can't have a whole one, oh! give a little bit _O!_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEPIGRAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On Sir_ ELIJAH IMPEY _refusing to resign his Gown as_ CHIEF JUSTICE\r\nOF BENGAL.\r\n\r\n  Of yore, ELIJAH, it is stated,\r\n  By angels when to Heav'n translated,\r\n  Before the saint aloft would ride,\r\n  His prophet's robe he cast aside;\r\n  Thinking the load might sorely gravel\r\n  His porters on so long a travel;\r\n  But our ELIJAH somewhat doubting,\r\n  To him SAINT PETER may prove flouting,\r\n  And wisely of his mantle thinking,\r\n  That its furr'd weight may aid his sinking,\r\n  Scornful defies his namesake's joke,\r\n  And swears by G--d he'll keep his cloak.\r\n\r\nANOTHER.\r\n\r\n_By Mr_.

NOW IT IS HEREBY\r\nORDERED, and strictly ordained, by and with the advice of the PRIVY\r\nCOUNCIL, that all his Majesty's liege subjects, of all ranks,\r\ndescriptions, or denominations whatever, be henceforward, and from the\r\ndate hereof, required and enjoined, under the penalty of a\r\n_premunire_, to drink, swill, and make away with a certain quantity of\r\nthe said nostrum and salutary decoction in the course of each natural\r\nday, in the order and proportion as directed and ascertained in the\r\nlist or schedule herein after following, _viz_.\r\n\r\nI. To every DUKE, MARQUIS, EARL, VISCOUNT, and BARON, within his\r\nMajesty's kingdom of GREAT BRITAIN, one pound per day.--If GREEN be\r\ntoo strong for their nerves, they may use SOUCHONG.--The method of\r\nmaking it, that is to say, strong, weak, and so on, is left to the\r\nnoble personages themselves.\r\n\r\nII. To every IRISH ditto, two pound per ditto.--This will be no\r\ninconvenience, as smuggled claret will not be in future to be had.\r\n\r\nIII. DUCHESSES, DUCHESS DOWAGERS, COUNTESSES, and BARONESSES, one\r\npound per ditto.--As this regulation is not intended to hurt his\r\nMajesty's Customs, a mixture of LIQUEURS will be permitted as usual.\r\n\r\nIV. MAIDS OF HONOUR, CHAPLAINS, the MEMBERS of the CLUB AT WHITE's,\r\nand other young gentlemen of that RANK and DESCRIPTION (being pretty\r\nnearly the usual quantity), two pound per ditto.\r\n\r\nV. To COUNTRY 'SQUIRES, FOX-HUNTERS, &c. as a most agreeable\r\nsubstitute for STINGO and OCTOBER, three pound per ditto.\r\n\r\nVI. To DRAYMEN, CHAIRMEN, and BARGEMEN, instead of PORTER, two pound\r\nper ditto.\r\n\r\nVII. To the Commonalty of this Realm, to drink with their victuals\r\nand otherwise, at one pound for each person per ditto.\r\n\r\nAnd IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, that no excuse or plea whatever shall be\r\ndeemed valid, for the non-compliance with the above regulations; AND\r\nthat whoever shall pretend, that the said wholesome and benign\r\ndecoction, either does not agree with him, or is more expensive than\r\nhis finances or state of life will permit, shall be only considered\r\nas aggravating the offence of disobedience, by a contumacious doubt\r\nof the better knowledge of his superiors, and a ridiculous endeavour\r\nto seem to be better acquainted with his own constitution and\r\ncircumstances, than the efficient Minister of the country.\r\n\r\n  GIVEN _at our Palace in_ DOWNING-STREET,\r\n       _this 24th Day of June, 1784._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGINAL LETTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany doubts having arisen, principally among the gentlemen who belong\r\nto the same profession with the Master of the Rolls, whether that\r\ndistinguished character has _really_ sent a draft to the HIGH BAILIFF\r\nof WESTMINSTER, for the expences of a late trial and verdict in the\r\nCommon Pleas; and although the fact is not exactly as it has been\r\nrepresented, yet the following authentic letter will sufficiently\r\nevince the generous intentions of Sir LL----D, as soon as he becomes\r\nrich enough for him to answer so heavy a demand. At present, all who\r\nknow the very circumscribed state of his income, compared with the\r\nliberality of his expenditure--who consider the extent of those\r\ndifferent establishments, which he feels it necessary to keep up\r\nby way of preserving the dignity of his high office--his wardrobe\r\nand table for instance--will acknowledge the plea of poverty to be\r\njustly urged.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To_ THOMAS CORBETT, _Esq.\r\nChancery-Lane._\r\n\r\n_My dear and faithful friend, Tho. Corbett,_\r\n\r\n\"I anticipate your application to me, for the expences of defending\r\nyourself against the action brought by that fellow, FOX. If eternally\r\ndamning the jury would pay the verdict, I would not scruple to assist\r\nyou to the utmost of my abilities.--Though THURLOW is against us upon\r\nthis point, and to swear with him, you know, would be just as vain a\r\nthing as to swear with the Devil; but, my friend, the long and the\r\nshort of this matter is, that I am _wretched poor_--wretchedly so, I\r\ndo assure you, in every sense and signification of the word. I have\r\nlong borne the profitless incumbrance of nominal and ideal wealth. My\r\nincome has been cruelly estimated at seven, or, as some will have it,\r\neight thousand pounds per annum. The profession of which I am a\r\nMember, my dear THOMAS, has taught me to value facts infinitely more\r\nthan either words or reasons. I shall save myself, therefore, the\r\nmortification of denying that I am rich, and refer you to the constant\r\nhabits, and whole tenor of my life. The proof to my friends is\r\neasy--Of the economy which I am obliged to observe in one very necessary\r\narticle, my taylor's bill for these last fifteen years, is a record\r\nof the most indisputable authority. There are malicious souls, who\r\nmay object to this, as by no means the best evidence of the state of\r\nmy wardrobe; they will direct you, perhaps, to Lord STORMONT's\r\nValet de Chambre, and accompany the hint with an anecdote, that\r\non the day when I kissed hands for my appointment to the office of\r\nAttorney-General, I appeared in a laced waistcoat that once belonged\r\nto his master. The topic is invidious, and I disdain to enter into\r\nit.--I _bought_ the waistcoat, but despise the insinuation--nor is this\r\nthe only instance in which I am obliged to diminish my wants, and\r\napportion them to my very limited means. Lady K. will be my witness,\r\nthat until my last appointment, I was an utter stranger to the luxury\r\nof a pocket handkerchief.\r\n\r\n\"If you wish to know how I live, come and satisfy yourself--I shall\r\ndine at home this day three months, and if you are not engaged, and\r\nbreakfast late, shall be heartily glad of your company; but in truth,\r\nmy butler's place is become an absolute sinecure--early habits of\r\nsobriety, and self-denial, my friend, have made me what I am--have\r\ndeceived the approach of age, and enabled me to support the laborious\r\nduties, and hard vicissitudes of my station.\r\n\r\n\"Besides, my dear BAILIFF, there are many persons to whom your\r\napplication would be made with infinitely more propriety than to me.\r\nThe nature of PEPPER ARDEN is mild, gentle, accommodating to the\r\nextreme, and I will venture to engage that he would by no means\r\nrefuse a reasonable contribution. MACDONALD is, among those who\r\nknow him, a very proverb for generosity; and will certainly stand\r\nby you, together with DUNDAS and the LORD ADVOCATE, if there be\r\nfidelity in Scotchmen. BEARCROFT too will open his purse to you with\r\nthe same blind and improvident magnanimity with which he risqued his\r\nopinion in your favour: besides, you are sure of PITT.--A real zeal\r\nfor your welfare, a most disinterested friendship, and some\r\nconsciousness that I have materially helped to involve you; and,\r\nbelieve me, not the sordid motive of shifting either the blame,\r\nor the expence upon the shoulders of others, have made me thus\r\neagerly endeavour to put you in the way of consulting your best\r\nfriends in this very critical emergency.\r\n\r\n\"As to myself, you are possessed already of the circumstances which\r\nrender any immediate assistance on my part wholly out of the question.\r\nExcept half a dozen pair of black plush breeches, which I have but\r\nthis instant received, I can offer you nothing. My superfluities\r\nextend no further. But better times may soon arrive, and I will not\r\nfail you then. The present Chief Justice of the King's Bench cannot\r\nlong retain his situation; and as you are one whom I have selected\r\nfrom among many to be the friend of my bosom, I will now reveal to\r\nyou a great secret in the last arrangement of judicial offices.\r\nKnow then, that Sir ELIJAH IMPEY is the man fixed upon to preside\r\nin the chief seat of criminal and civil jurisprudence of this country.\r\nI am to succeed him in BENGAL; and then, my dear THOMAS, we may set\r\nthe malice of juries at defiance. If they had given FOX as many\r\ndiamonds by their verdict as they have pounds, rest assured that\r\nI am not a person likely to fail you, after I shall have been there\r\na little while, either through want of faith, or want of means.\r\nSet your mind, therefore, at ease; as to the money--why, if PITT is\r\ndetermined to have nothing to do with it, and if nobody else will\r\npay it, I think the most adviseable thing, in your circumstances,\r\nwill be to pay it yourself. Not that you are to be ultimately at the\r\nexpence of a single shilling. The contents of this letter will fully\r\nprove that I mean to reimburse you what I am able. For the present,\r\nnobody knows better than yourself, not even Lady K----, how ill\r\nmatters stand with me, and that I find it utterly impossible to obey\r\nthe dictates of my feelings.\r\n\r\n    \"I am, my dear HIGH BAILIFF,\r\n      Your very affectionate friend,\r\n        And humble servant,\r\n                                  L.K.\"\r\n  \"_Lincoln's-inn-fields_,\r\n    _June 20, 1786._\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA CONGRATULATORY ODE,\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESSED TO THE\r\nRIGHT HON.

His Majesty's _bon mot_ on this\r\noccasion should not be forgot. \"What! what!

Sir RICHARD had composed a beautiful\r\nsacred cantata on the occasion, dedicated to his brother, the Rev.\r\nROWLAND HILL. The first stanza alludes, by an apt quotation from the\r\n68th Psalm, to the elevation and dignities of the family:\r\n              \"Why hop so high, ye little H_I_LLS?\"\r\n              With joy, the Lord's anointed f_i_lls;\r\n                Let's pray with one accord!\r\n              In sleepless visions of the night,\r\n              NORTH's cheek I smote with all my might,\r\n                For which I'm made a Lord, &c. &c.\r\n\r\n[5] The King of PRUSSIA replenished his exhausted treasury in the war\r\nof 1756, by a coinage of pewter ducats.\r\n\r\n[6] \"Besides the twenty-four officer above described, there were\r\neleven others of considerable value in the courts of the ancient\r\nPrinces, the most remarkable of which was, that of the King's\r\nfeet-bearer; this was a young gentleman, whose duty it was to sit\r\non the floor, with his back towards the fire, and hold the King's\r\nfeet in his bosom all the time he sat at table, to keep them warm\r\nand comfortable.\"\r\n  _Leges Wallicæ, p.58.--Henry's History of Great Britain, v.2,p.275_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nODE\r\n_to_ SIR ELIJAH IMPEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Æli, vetusto nobilis a Lamo,\r\n    Quando et priores hinc Lamia ferunt\r\n    Denominatos, &c.\r\n\r\n  ELI-JAH noblest of the race\r\n  Of [1]IMPS, from whom the IMPEYS trace,\r\n    If common fame says true,\r\n  Their origin; and that they found\r\n  Their claim on just and solid ground,\r\n    Refer for _proof_ to you--\r\n\r\n  You, who could post nine hundred miles,\r\n  To fathom an old woman's wiles,\r\n    Possess'd of _dangerous_ treasure;\r\n  Could hurry with a pedlar's pack\r\n  Of affidavits at your back,\r\n    In quest of health and pleasure.\r\n\r\n  And all because the jealous JOVE[2]\r\n  Of Eastern climes thought fit to prove\r\n    The _venom_ of his reign;\r\n  On which, to minds of light esteem,\r\n  _Some few severities_ might seem\r\n    To leave a transient stain.\r\n\r\n  Soon [3] on your head from yon dark sky,\r\n  Or WOODFALL'_s Hasty Sketches_ lye,\r\n    The gather'd storm will break!\r\n  Deep will the vengeful thunder be,\r\n  And from the sleep he owes to thee,\r\n    Shall NUNDCOMAR awake!\r\n\r\n  Then arm against the rude attack,\r\n  Recall thy roving memory back,\r\n    And all thy proofs collect!--\r\n  Remember that you cannot gain\r\n  A second hearing to _explain_,\r\n    And [4] _therefore_ be correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] MILTON makes honourable mention of the founder of the family:\r\n    \"Fit vessel, fittest _Imp_ of Fraud.\"\r\n                                        _Paradise Lost, b._ IX.\r\n\r\nIt may be observed, in proof of the descent, as well as to the credit\r\nof the present Representative, that he has not degenerated from the\r\ncharacteristic \"obliquity\" of his Ancestor.\r\n\r\n[2] Late Tyrannus.\r\n\r\n[3] Demissa tempestas ab Euro\r\n    Sternet--Nisi fallit Augur\r\n    Anosa Cornix.\r\n\r\n[4] See Declaration of Sir E---- I----, offered to the House by\r\nMt.

Got into a damned scrape about\r\ncotton--second time I've been detected--won't speak any more.--N.B.\r\nNot to let BARING come into the Direction again.--FOX spoke--PITT\r\ncould not answer him, and told the House he was too hoarse--forgot at\r\nthe time to disguise his voice.\r\n\r\n_March_ 9th.--Got THURLOW to dine with us at _Wimbledon_--gave him my\r\nbest Burgundy and Blasphemy, to put him into good humour.--After a\r\nbrace of bottles, ventured to drop a hint of business--THURLOW damned\r\nme, and asked PITT for a sentiment--PITT looked foolish--GRENVILLE\r\nwise--MULGRAVE stared--SYDNEY's chin lengthened--tried the effects of\r\nanother bottle.--PITT began a long speech about the subject of our\r\nmeeting--SYDNEY fell asleep by the fire--MULGRAVE and GRENVILLE\r\nretired to the old game of the board, and played push-pin for\r\nensigncies in the new corps--Grenville won three.--Mem.--To punish\r\ntheir presumption, will not let either of them have one.\r\n\r\nTHURLOW very queer.--He swore the bill is absurd, and my\r\ncorrespondence with those cursed Directors damned stupid.--However,\r\nwill vote and speak with us--PITT quite sick of him--says he growls at\r\nevery thing, proposes nothing, and supports any thing.\r\n\r\nN.B. Must look about for a new Chancellor--Scott might do, but cants\r\ntoo much about his independence and his conscience--what the devil\r\nhas he to do with independence and conscience--besides he has a\r\nsnivelling trick of retracting when he is caught in a lie--hate such\r\npuling fellows--GEORGE HARDINGE not much better--must try him\r\ntho'--will order him to speak on Wednesday.\r\n\r\nTook PITT to town in my chariot--drove to Berkeley-street--got PITT\r\nto the door, but he would not come in--lounged an hour with\r\nCHARLOTTE--promised her a company in one of the new regiments for a\r\ndisbanded private of the Horse Guards.--Why not order the whole House\r\nto be qualified at DRUMMOND's, and charge it to the Company's secret\r\nservice?\r\n\r\n_March_ 10th.--Sent for TWINING--when he came, had by me a large bason\r\nof his SOUCHONG--drank it without a wry face--the most nauseous black\r\ndraught I ever swallowed--swore it was excellent--quoted a sentence\r\nfrom CICERO, which I got from PRETTYMAN for the occasion--promised to\r\nput TWINING on my House-list next year, give him one of the Chairs,\r\nand put the Tea-Trade under the Secret Committee--TWINING to procure\r\na requisition for a General Court--gave him hints for a speech--to\r\nabuse Baring damnably.\r\n\r\nCalled at WHITEHALL--took away the last letters from CORNWALLIS, that\r\nPITT may not see them before they are _properly copied_ out by my\r\nprivate Secretary.--Left orders for PITT and SYDNEY to follow me\r\nto my house, where they would find my dispatches for India ready\r\nfor signing.\r\n\r\n_March_ 11th.--Dined with the Directors--almost too late; _London\r\nTavern_ not near enough.--Mem. to order the Directors in future always\r\nto dine in my neighbourhood, and allow them to charge the additional\r\ncoach-hire to the Company--Why not buy a _long stage_ to carry them\r\nabout wherever I may want them?\r\n\r\nPITT frightened when we got into the City, lest the mob should\r\nhiss--talked about _Grocers' Hall_ and better times; asked me if I was\r\nnot glad they were going to pull down _Temple bar_, and hoped there\r\nwould be no further occasion for it.\r\n\r\nTried to prevent his being melancholy--threw a shilling among the\r\nblackguards--would not do--no huzzaing. N.B. Not to forget to make the\r\nChairman repay me, the money being disbursed in the Company's service.\r\n\r\nGot to the LONDON TAVERN at six. Drew up my Commissioners in the\r\npassage, and gave them their orders--told PITT to follow next to me,\r\nand bid MULGRAVE speak in his upper voice, and be affable.--Tried to\r\nlaugh as we entered the room--MULGRAVE put us out by one of his\r\ngrowling sighs--damn the fellow! must get rid of him.--Told DEVAYNES\r\nto laugh for us all--did it well--make him Chairman next year.\r\n\r\nDinner good--don't see why we should not dine with them always.--N.B.\r\nOrdered twelve dozen of their claret to be carried to\r\n_Wimbledon_--LUSHINGTON grumbled, and asked by what authority I did\r\nit.--A very troublesome fellow that--remove him.\r\n\r\nPITT peevish and out of spirits; ordered MOTTEUX to sing a song--began\r\n\"_Ah si vous pouviez comprendre._\" PITT turned red, and thought\r\nthe Chairman alluded to some dark passages in the India Bill--endeavoured\r\nto pacify him, and told the _Secret Committee_ to give us a soft air;\r\nthey sung in a low voice \"_the cause I must not, dare not\r\ntell_\"--MANSHIP groaned, and drank Colonel CATHCART. By G--, if I\r\nthought he meant to betray me, I'd indict him for perjury!--Somebody\r\nstruck up \"_if you trust before you try._\"--PITT asked if the\r\nDirectors wished to affront, him, and began a long harangue about his\r\nregard and friendship for the Company;--_nine_ Directors offered to\r\nswear for it--told them they need not--bowed, and thanked me.\r\n\r\nLE MESURIER begged our attention to a little French Air, \"_Sous le nom\r\nde l'amitié en finesse on abonde_\"--cursed _mal-à-propos_.\r\n\r\nPITT swore he was insulted, and got up to go away. The Alderman, much\r\nterrified at what he had done, protested solemnly he meant no offence,\r\nand called God to witness, it was a very harmless song he learnt some\r\ntime ago in _Guernsey_--Could not appease PITT--so went away with him,\r\nafter ordering MULGRAVE not to let SYDNEY drink any more wine, for\r\nfear he should begin talking.\r\n\r\nPITT desired the servants to put out the flambeaux, as we went through\r\nthe city--(a sad coward!) asked me if I did not think FOX's a very\r\nable speech--sighed, and said he had promised to answer it\r\nto-morrow--wished however to do nothing in a hurry--expressed much\r\ndiffidence in his own abilities, and paid me many compliments--thought\r\nI had a fine opportunity to shew my talents--assured me he should think\r\nnothing of waving _his_ right to reply; and that he had not the least\r\nobjection to letting _me_ answer FOX--begged to decline the offer.\r\nN.B. He seemed very uneasy and much frightened--never knew him\r\n_diffident_ before--wish to-morrow was well over.\r\n\r\nCame home--opened a bottle of champaigne which I brought in the\r\ncarriage with me from the Directors' dinner--looked over my list of\r\n_levee_ men--found nine field officers yet unprovided for. Wrote to\r\nROSS, enclosing the copy of a letter to be sent to me from Lord\r\nC----LL--S requiring more King's troops--finished my bottle and\r\nwent to bed.\r\n\r\n_March_ 12.--Went to the levee--He looked surly--would hardly speak to\r\nme--don't like him--must have heard that I can govern INDIA without\r\nconsulting him.--Nothing ever escapes that _damned_ fellow SHERIDAN!\r\n\r\nBetween four and five went to the House--worse than the levee--PITT\r\nwould not speak, pretended it was better to wait for FOX--put him in\r\nmind of the excuse he made at the end of the last debate, and his\r\n_promise_ to answer _calumnies_--don't mind promises--a damned good\r\nquality that--but ought to consider his friends--GEO. HARDINGE spoke\r\nin consequence of my orders--forgot I was sitting below him--attacked\r\nLord NORTH's administration--got into a cursed scrape with\r\nPOWIS--won't do for CHANCELLOR--why not try BURGESS?--SCOTT defended\r\nwhat he had said in the last debate--made it worse than ever--quoted\r\nfrom DEBRETT's debates--talked about an _adder_--thought he was\r\nalluding to PITT--our lawyers somehow don't answer--ADAM and\r\nANSTRUTHER worth them all--can't they be bought?--_Scotchmen!_--damned\r\nstrange if they can't--Mem. to tell ROSE to sound them.\r\n\r\nADAM severe on me and the rest that have betrayed Lord NORTH--a\r\ngeneral confusion all round PITT--no one to defend us--VILLIERS\r\ngrinned--GRAHAM simpered--MULGRAVE growled--by G--d I believe PITT\r\nenjoyed it--always pleased when his friends get into a scrape.--Mem.\r\nto give him a lecture upon that--MULGRAVE spoke at last--wish he'd\r\nheld his tongue--SHERIDAN answered him--improves every day--wish we\r\nhad him----very odd so clever a fellow shouldn't be able to see his\r\nown interest--wouldn't venture on a reply myself, for fear of another\r\nlick from that clumsy boor Sir EDWARD ASTLEY--said my long speech was\r\ndull and tiresome--what's the matter with the fellow?--used to vote\r\nwith us--believe LANSDOWN's got him.--Mem. to tell STEELE to look out\r\nfor another Member for the county of Norfolk.\r\n\r\nJogged PITT--told him SHERIDAN's speech _must_ be answered--said, _I_\r\nmight do it then, for he _couldn't_--PULTENEY relieved us a little,\r\npretending to be gull'd by the _checks_--too great nonsense to have\r\nany effect on the House.--BASTARD forgot his last abuse of PITT, and\r\ntalked again about confidence; but was against the Bill--what's\r\nconfidence without a vote?--came to a division at last--better than\r\nthe former--had whipped in well from SCOTLAND--the House seems\r\ntired--hope we shan't have much more of this.\r\n\r\nMem. to give orders to MANNERS to make a noise, and let nobody speak\r\non third reading--a very useful fellow that MANNERS--does more good\r\nsometimes than ten speakers.\r\n\r\n_March_ 14th. God's infinite mercy be praised, AMEN! This is the last\r\nday that infernal DECLARATORY BILL stays in the House of Commons--as\r\nfor the _Lords_--but that's no business of mine; only poor\r\nSYDNEY!--Well--God bless us all--AMEN!\r\n\r\nGot up and wrote the above, after a very restless night--went to bed\r\nagain--but could not sleep--troubled with the _blue devils_--thought I\r\nsaw POWIS--recovered myself a little, and fell into a slumber--Dreamt\r\nI heard SHERIDAN speaking to me through the curtains--woke in a\r\nfright, and jumped out of bed.\r\n\r\nWent down stairs--found some of the DIRECTORS waiting in the\r\nhall--_damned their bloods_, and told them this was all their\r\ndoing--informed me a General Court was called by the enemy--bid them\r\nmake such a noise, that nobody might be heard--DEVAYNES undertook\r\nit--ordered the SECRET COMMITTEE to stay, and sent the rest about\r\ntheir business.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast wrote to HAWK----Y, and begged his acceptance of a\r\n_Lieut. Colonelcy, 2 Majorities, a Collectorship, 3 Shawls_ and a\r\npiece of _India Muslin_ for the young ladies--sent back one of the\r\n_Shawls_, and said he'd rather have another _Collector's\r\nplace_--Damnation! but it must be so, or SYDNEY will be left to\r\nhimself.--N.B. Not to forget THURLOW's _Arrack_ and _Gunpowder Tea_,\r\nwith the _India Crackers_ for his children.\r\n\r\nMULGRAVE called to know if I wanted him to speak to-day--told him\r\nnot--had enough of him last time.\r\n\r\nWent down to the House--ANSTRUTHER played the devil with all our\r\n_checks_ and _guards_--serves us right for introducing such\r\nnonsense--GEORGE NORTH asked when I meant to open my budget--said,\r\nwhen the RAVENSWORTH arrives--pray God she be lost! Mem. When I do\r\nopen my budget, to state all the accounts in _Tales, Pagodas_, and\r\n_Mohurs_--has a fine effect on the country gentlemen, and prevents\r\nmany impertinent observations.\r\n\r\nWaited very patiently for PITT's _promised answer_ to FOX's\r\n_calumnies_ till eight o'clock--fresh inquiries about it every\r\nminute--began to be very uneasy--saw OPPOSITION sneering--SHERIDAN\r\nasked PITT if he was _hoarse_ yet--looked exceedingly foolish--pitied\r\nhim, and, by way of relieving his aukward situation, spoke myself--made\r\nsome of my boldest assertions--said a good thing about \"_A Mare's\r\nNest_\"--coined a few clauses, which I assured the House were in Fox's\r\nBill, and sat down with much applause--was afterwards unfortunately\r\ndetected in every thing I had said, and universally scouted by all\r\nsides.--Mem. I should not have got into that scrape, if I had not\r\ntried to help a friend in distress.--N.B. Never to do it again--there's\r\nnothing to be gained by it.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I recovered myself, asked PITT whether he really meant to\r\nanswer FOX, or not--Owned at last, with tears in his eyes, he could\r\nnot muster courage enough to attempt it--sad work this!--N.B. Observed\r\nGRENVILLE made a note, that a man need not be an orator, to be\r\n_Chancellor of the Exchequer_--he seemed pleased with the precedent.\r\n\r\nNothing left for it but to cry _question!_--divided--only 54\r\nmajority--here's a job!\r\n\r\nSHERIDAN read a cursed malicious paper, in which he proved PITT an\r\nimpostor: and that what FOX had openly demanded, the _Board of\r\nControul_ had secretly stolen.--Brother Commissioners all turned\r\npale--was obliged to rub their noses with _Thieves Vinegar_, and then\r\nslunk out of the House as fast as I could.----N.B. Believe OLD\r\nPEARSON's a sneering son of a bitch--tried to whistle as I went\r\nthrough the lobby--asked me if I was unwell--damn his impudence.\r\n\r\nCame home in a very melancholy mood--returned thanks in a short prayer\r\nfor our narrow escape--drank a glass of brandy--confessed my\r\nsins--determined to reform, and sent to WILBERFORCE for a good book--a\r\nvery worthy and religious young man that--like him much--always votes\r\nwith us.\r\n\r\nWas beginning to grow very dejected, when ROSE called to inform me\r\nof an excellent scheme about BANK STOCK--a snug thing, and not more\r\nthan twenty in the secret--raised my spirits again--told the servant\r\nI would not trouble Mr. WILBERFORCE--ordered a bottle of best\r\nburgundy--set to it with ROSE, hand to fist--congratulated one another\r\non having got the DECLARATORY BILL out of our House--and drank good\r\nluck to SYDNEY, and a speedy progress through the Lords.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINCANTATION,\r\n\r\nFOR RAISING A PHANTOM, IMITATED FROM MACBETH, AND LATELY PERFORMED\r\nBY HIS MAJESTY'S SERVANTS IN WESTMINSTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thunder.

If in doubt, no correction has\r\nbeen made. For example, the following have not been corrected:\r\n\r\n  page : original                      : correction\r\n  --------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  308  : babes and suckling's mouths   : babes and sucklings' mouths\r\n  327  : And junto's speak             : And juntos speak\r\n  422  : independant                   : independent\r\n\r\n§ Spellings, of which it is assumed that they were not intended by\r\nthe authors, have been put right. These corrections were only made\r\nafter consulting earlier and/or later editions of the Rolliad.\r\n\r\n  page : original                      : correction\r\n  --------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n   iv  : Delavalid                     : Delavaliad\r\n   36  : feeedom                       : freedom\r\n   84  : AHPION's lyre                 : AMPHION's lyre\r\n   84  : postion                       : position\r\n  126  : chip                          : ship\r\n  135  : witticism of of his Grace     : witticism of his Grace\r\n  144  : The' Athenian sages           : Th' Athenian sages\r\n  168  : depe n d ants                 : dependants\r\n  171  : sigh of love                  : sight of love\r\n  172  : vi on                         : vision\r\n  179  : chatised                      : chastised\r\n  191  : neu te paeniteat calamo       : nec te paeniteat calamo\r\n  192  : Ex dixit moriens              : Et dixit moriens\r\n  192  : sparsis etiamnunc pellibus    : sparsis etiam nunc pellibus\r\n  200  : St. Sephen                    : St. Stephen\r\n  213  : Ægie                          : Ægle\r\n  229  : pecimens                      : specimens\r\n  229  : Versificators Crononæ         : Versificators Coronæ\r\n  304  : insruct me                    : instruct me\r\n  308  : in worthy strain sbe sung     : in worthy strains be sung\r\n  316  : his mouth his opes            : his mouth he opes\r\n  351  : antistrope                    : antistrophe\r\n  358  : sacred patern                 : sacred pattern\r\n  440  : PRETEYMAN                     : PRETTYMAN\r\n  507  : what the devil has he do      : what the devil has he to do\r\n\r\n§ In the content of the original, subsequent odes were listed as\r\n'Ditto', and at the start of a new page as 'Ode'. This was considered\r\nunnecessary in an e-text. On page iv of the contents, 'Ode' has\r\ntherefore been replaced by 'Ditto'.\r\n\r\n§ In the eclogue on Jekyll every fifth line is numbered. However,\r\nlines 20, 25 and 35 were too long to accommodate these numbers in\r\nthe original. Instead, lines 21, 26 and 36 received a number. In\r\nthis e-text, the numbering has been put on 20, 25, and 35.\r\n\r\n§ Similarly, in the eclogue on Nicholson the line number 105 did not\r\nfit on the line. For that reason, line 106 bears the line number.\r\n\r\n§ In the eclogue on Jenkinson, line number 25 is placed on line 26.\r\nThis has been corrected in this e-text.\r\n\r\n§ The last word on page 349 and the first word on page 350 are both\r\n'that'. One has been eliminated.\r\n\r\n§ The following typographical errors relating to punctuation have been\r\ncorrected:\r\n\r\n  page : original                      : correction\r\n  --------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  224  : \" \"                           : \"\r\n  240  : Sir Joseph                    : \"Sir Joseph\r\n  442  : will seem true!               : will seem true!\"\r\n  443  : by outlying,                  : by outlying.\r\n\r\n§ One poem, set in a blackletter script, has been marked like so:\r\n\r\n[Blackletter:\r\n    ...\r\n    ...]\r\n\r\n§ One couplet was struck through and has been marked like so:\r\n\r\n[Struck-through:\r\n    ...\r\n    ...]\r\n\r\n§ The original uses curly brackets that span over several lines to\r\nindicate repetition.
