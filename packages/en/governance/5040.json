Eisenhower\r\nFebruary 2, 1953\r\n\r\nMr. President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the Eighty-third Congress:\r\n\r\nI welcome the honor of appearing before you to deliver my first message to\r\nthe Congress.\r\n\r\nIt is manifestly the joint purpose of the congressional leadership and of\r\nthis administration to justify the summons to governmental responsibility\r\nissued last November by the American people. The grand labors of this\r\nleadership will involve:\r\n\r\nApplication of America's influence in world affairs with such fortitude and\r\nsuch foresight that it will deter aggression and eventually secure peace;\r\n\r\nEstablishment of a national administration of such integrity and such\r\nefficiency that its honor at home will ensure respect abroad;\r\n\r\nEncouragement of those incentives that inspire creative initiative in our\r\neconomy, so that its productivity may fortify freedom everywhere; and\r\n\r\nDedication to the well-being of all our citizens and to the attainment of\r\nequality of opportunity for all, so that our Nation will ever act with the\r\nstrength of unity in every task to which it is called.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this message is to suggest certain lines along which our\r\njoint efforts may immediately be directed toward realization of these four\r\nruling purposes.\r\n\r\nThe time that this administration has been in office has been too brief to\r\npermit preparation of a detailed and comprehensive program of recommended\r\naction to cover all phases of the responsibilities that devolve upon our\r\ncountry's new leaders. Such a program will be filled out in the weeks ahead\r\nas, after appropriate study, I shall submit additional recommendations for\r\nyour consideration. Today can provide only a sure and substantial\r\nbeginning.\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nOur country has come through a painful period of trial and disillusionment\r\nsince the victory of 1945. We anticipated a world of peace and cooperation.\r\nThe calculated pressures of aggressive communism have forced us, instead,\r\nto live in a world of turmoil.\r\n\r\nFrom this costly experience we have learned one clear lesson. We have\r\nlearned that the free world cannot indefinitely remain in a posture of\r\nparalyzed tension, leaving forever to the aggressor the choice of time and\r\nplace and means to cause greatest hurt to us at least cost to himself.\r\n\r\nThis administration has, therefore, begun the definition of a new, positive\r\nforeign policy. This policy will be governed by certain fixed ideas. They\r\nare these:\r\n\r\n(1) Our foreign policy must be clear, consistent, and confident. This means\r\nthat it must be the product of genuine, continuous cooperation between the\r\nexecutive and the legislative branches of this Government. It must be\r\ndeveloped and directed in the spirit of true bipartisanship.\r\n\r\n(2) The policy we embrace must be a coherent global policy. The freedom we\r\ncherish and defend in Europe and in the Americas is no different from the\r\nfreedom that is imperiled in Asia.\r\n\r\n(3) Our policy, dedicated to making the free world secure, will envision\r\nall peaceful methods and devices--except breaking faith with our friends.\r\nWe shall never acquiesce in the enslavement of any people in order to\r\npurchase fancied gain for ourselves. I shall ask the Congress at a later\r\ndate to join in an appropriate resolution making clear that this Government\r\nrecognizes no kind of commitment contained in secret understandings of the\r\npast with foreign governments which permit this kind of enslavement.\r\n\r\n(4) The policy we pursue will recognize the truth that no single country,\r\neven one so powerful as ours, can alone defend the liberty of all nations\r\nthreatened by Communist aggression from without or subversion within.\r\nMutual security means effective mutual cooperation. For the United States,\r\nthis means that, as a matter of common sense and national interest, we\r\nshall give help to other nations in the measure that they strive earnestly\r\nto do their full share of the common task. No wealth of aid could\r\ncompensate for poverty of spirit. The heart of every free nation must be\r\nhonestly dedicated to the preserving of its own independence and security.\r\n\r\n(5) Our policy will be designed to foster the advent of practical unity in\r\nWestern Europe. The nations of that region have contributed notably to the\r\neffort of sustaining the security of the free world. From the jungles of\r\nIndochina and Malaya to the northern shores of Europe, they have vastly\r\nimproved their defensive strength. Where called upon to do so, they have\r\nmade costly and bitter sacrifices to hold the line of freedom.\r\n\r\nBut the problem of security demands closer cooperation among the nations of\r\nEurope than has been known to date. Only a more closely integrated economic\r\nand political system can provide the greatly increased economic strength\r\nneeded to maintain both necessary military readiness and respectable living\r\nstandards.\r\n\r\nEurope's enlightened leaders have long been aware of these facts. All the\r\ndevoted work that has gone into the Schuman plan, the European Army, and\r\nthe Strasbourg Conference has testified to their vision and determination.\r\nThese achievements are the more remarkable when we realize that each of\r\nthem has marked a victory--for France and for Germany alike over the\r\ndivisions that in the past have brought such tragedy to these two great\r\nnations and to the world.\r\n\r\nThe needed unity of Western Europe manifestly cannot be manufactured from\r\nwithout; it can only be created from within. But it is right and necessary\r\nthat we encourage Europe's leaders by informing them of the high value we\r\nplace upon the earnestness of their efforts toward this goal. Real progress\r\nwill be conclusive evidence to the American people that our material\r\nsacrifices in the cause of collective security are matched by essential\r\npolitical, economic, and military accomplishments in Western Europe.\r\n\r\n(6) Our foreign policy will recognize the importance of profitable and\r\nequitable world trade.\r\n\r\nA substantial beginning can and should be made by our friends themselves.\r\nEurope, for example, is now marked by checkered areas of labor surplus and\r\nlabor shortage, of agricultural areas needing machines and industrial areas\r\nneeding food. Here and elsewhere we can hope that our friends will take the\r\ninitiative in creating broader markets and more dependable currencies, to\r\nallow greater exchange of goods and services among themselves.\r\n\r\nAction along these lines can create an economic environment that will\r\ninvite vital help from us.\r\n\r\nThis help includes:\r\n\r\nFirst: Revising our customs regulations to remove procedural obstacles to\r\nprofitable trade. I further recommend that the Congress take the Reciprocal\r\nTrade Agreements Act under immediate study and extend it by appropriate\r\nlegislation. This objective must not ignore legitimate safeguarding of\r\ndomestic industries, agriculture, and labor standards. In all executive\r\nstudy and recommendations on this problem labor and management and farmers\r\nalike will be earnestly consulted.\r\n\r\nSecond: Doing whatever Government properly can to encourage the flow of\r\nprivate American investment abroad. This involves, as a serious and\r\nexplicit purpose of our foreign policy, the encouragement of a hospitable\r\nclimate for such investment in foreign nations.\r\n\r\nThird: Availing ourselves of facilities overseas for the economical\r\nproduction of manufactured articles which are needed for mutual defense and\r\nwhich are not seriously competitive with our own normal peacetime\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\nFourth: Receiving from the rest of the world, in equitable exchange for\r\nwhat we supply, greater amounts of important raw materials which we do not\r\nourselves possess in adequate quantities.\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nIn this general discussion of our foreign policy, I must make special\r\nmention of the war in Korea.\r\n\r\nThis war is, for Americans, the most painful phase of Communist aggression\r\nthroughout the world. It is clearly a part of the same calculated assault\r\nthat the aggressor is simultaneously pressing in Indochina and in Malaya,\r\nand of the strategic situation that manifestly embraces the island of\r\nFormosa and the Chinese Nationalist forces there. The working out of any\r\nmilitary solution to the Korean war will inevitably affect all these\r\nareas.\r\n\r\nThe administration is giving immediate increased attention to the\r\ndevelopment of additional Republic of Korea forces. The citizens of that\r\ncountry have proved their capacity as fighting men and their eagerness to\r\ntake a greater share in the defense of their homeland. Organization,\r\nequipment, and training will allow them to do so. Increased assistance to\r\nKorea for this purpose conforms fully to our global policies.\r\n\r\nIn June 1950, following the aggressive attack on the Republic of Korea, the\r\nUnited States Seventh Fleet was instructed both to prevent attack upon\r\nFormosa and also to insure that Formosa should not be used as a base of\r\noperations against the Chinese Communist mainland.\r\n\r\nThis has meant, in effect, that the United States Navy was required to\r\nserve as a defensive arm of Communist China. Regardless of the situation in\r\n1950, since the date of that order the Chinese Communists have invaded\r\nKorea to attack the United Nations forces there. They have consistently\r\nrejected the proposals of the United Nations Command for an armistice. They\r\nrecently joined with Soviet Russia in rejecting the armistice proposal\r\nsponsored in the United Nations by the Government of India. This proposal\r\nhad been accepted by the United States and 53 other nations.\r\n\r\nConsequently there is no longer any logic or sense in a condition that\r\nrequired the United States Navy to assume defensive responsibilities on\r\nbehalf of the Chinese Communists, thus permitting those Communists, with\r\ngreater impunity, to kill our soldiers and those of our United Nations\r\nallies in Korea.\r\n\r\nI am, therefore, issuing instructions that the Seventh Fleet no longer be\r\nemployed to shield Communist China. This order implies no aggressive intent\r\non our part. But we certainly have no obligation to protect a nation\r\nfighting us in Korea.\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nOur labor for peace in Korea and in the world imperatively demands the\r\nmaintenance by the United States of a strong fighting service ready for any\r\ncontingency.\r\n\r\nOur problem is to achieve adequate military strength within the limits of\r\nendurable strain upon our economy. To amass military power without regard\r\nto our economic capacity would be to defend ourselves against one kind of\r\ndisaster by inviting another.\r\n\r\nBoth military and economic objectives demand a single national military\r\npolicy, proper coordination of our armed services, and effective\r\nconsolidation of certain logistics activities.\r\n\r\nWe must eliminate waste and duplication of effort in the armed services.\r\n\r\nWe must realize clearly that size alone is not sufficient. The biggest\r\nforce is not necessarily the best--and we want the best.\r\n\r\nWe must not let traditions or habits of the past stand in the way of\r\ndeveloping an efficient military force. All members of our forces must be\r\never mindful that they serve under a single flag and for a single cause.\r\n\r\nWe must effectively integrate our armament programs and plan them in such\r\ncareful relation to our industrial facilities that we assure the best use\r\nof our manpower and our materials.\r\n\r\nBecause of the complex technical nature of our military organization and\r\nbecause of the security reasons involved, the Secretary of Defense must\r\ntake the initiative and assume the responsibility for developing plans to\r\ngive our Nation maximum safety at minimum cost. Accordingly, the new\r\nSecretary of Defense and his civilian and military associates will, in the\r\nfuture, recommend such changes in present laws affecting our defense\r\nactivities as may be necessary to clarify responsibilities and improve the\r\ntotal effectiveness of our defense effort.\r\n\r\nThis effort must always conform to policies laid down in the National\r\nSecurity Council.\r\n\r\nThe statutory function of the National Security Council is to assist the\r\nPresident in the formulation and coordination of significant domestic,\r\nforeign, and military policies required for the security of the Nation. In\r\nthese days of tension it is essential that this central body have the\r\nvitality to perform effectively its statutory role. I propose to see that\r\nit does so.\r\n\r\nCareful formulation of policies must be followed by clear understanding of\r\nthem by all peoples. A related need, therefore, is to make more effective\r\nall activities of the Government related to international information.\r\n\r\nI have recently appointed a committee of representative and informed\r\ncitizens to survey this subject and to make recommendations in the near\r\nfuture for legislative, administrative, or other action.\r\n\r\nA unified and dynamic effort in this whole field is essential to the\r\nsecurity of the United States and of the other peoples in the community of\r\nfree nations. There is but one sure way to avoid total war--and that is to\r\nwin the cold war.\r\n\r\nWhile retaliatory power is one strong deterrent to a would-be aggressor,\r\nanother powerful deterrent is defensive power. No enemy is likely to\r\nattempt an attack foredoomed to failure.\r\n\r\nBecause the building of a completely impenetrable defense against attack is\r\nstill not possible, total defensive strength must include civil defense\r\npreparedness. Because we have incontrovertible evidence that Soviet Russia\r\npossesses atomic weapons, this kind of protection becomes sheer necessity.\r\n\r\nCivil defense responsibilities primarily belong to the State and local\r\ngovernments--recruiting, training, and organizing volunteers to meet any\r\nemergency. The immediate job of the Federal Government is to provide\r\nleadership, to supply technical guidance, and to continue to strengthen its\r\ncivil defense stockpile of medical, engineering, and related supplies and\r\nequipment. This work must go forward without lag.\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nI have referred to the inescapable need for economic health and strength if\r\nwe are to maintain adequate military power and exert influential leadership\r\nfor peace in the world.\r\n\r\nOur immediate task is to chart a fiscal and economic policy that can:\r\n\r\n(1) Reduce the planned deficits and then balance the budget, which means,\r\namong other things, reducing Federal expenditures to the safe minimum;\r\n\r\n(2) Meet the huge costs of our defense;\r\n\r\n(3) Properly handle the burden of our inheritance of debt and obligations;\r\n\r\n(4) Check the menace of inflation;\r\n\r\n(5) Work toward the earliest possible reduction of the tax burden;\r\n\r\n(6) Make constructive plans to encourage the initiative of our citizens.\r\n\r\nIt is important that all of us understand that this administration does not\r\nand cannot begin its task with a clean slate. Much already has been written\r\non the record, beyond our power quickly to erase or to amend. This record\r\nincludes our inherited burden of indebtedness and obligations and\r\ndeficits.\r\n\r\nThe current year's budget, as you know, carries a 5.9 billion dollar\r\ndeficit; and the budget, which was presented to you before this\r\nadministration took office, indicates a budgetary deficit of 9.9 billion\r\nfor the fiscal year ending June 30, 1954. The national debt is now more\r\nthan 265 billion dollars. In addition, the accumulated obligational\r\nauthority of the Federal Government for future payment totals over 80\r\nbillion dollars. Even this amount is exclusive of large contingent\r\nliabilities, so numerous and extensive as to be almost beyond description.\r\n\r\nThe bills for the payment of nearly all of the 80 billion dollars of\r\nobligations will be presented during the next 4 years. These bills, added\r\nto the current costs of government we must meet, make a formidable burden.\r\n\r\nThe present authorized Government-debt limit is 275 billion dollars. The\r\nforecast presented by the outgoing administration with the fiscal year 1954\r\nbudget indicates that--before the end of the fiscal year and at the peak of\r\ndemand for payments during the year--the total Government debt may approach\r\nand even exceed that limit. Unless budgeted deficits are checked, the\r\nmomentum of past programs will force an increase of the statutory debt\r\nlimit.\r\n\r\nPermit me this one understatement: to meet and to correct this situation\r\nwill not be easy.\r\n\r\nPermit me this one assurance: every department head and I are determined to\r\ndo everything we can to resolve it.\r\n\r\nThe first order of business is the elimination of the annual deficit. This\r\ncannot be achieved merely by exhortation. It demands the concerted action\r\nof all those in responsible positions in the Government and the earnest\r\ncooperation of the Congress.\r\n\r\nAlready, we have begun an examination of the appropriations and\r\nexpenditures of all departments in an effort to find significant items that\r\nmay be decreased or canceled without damage to our essential requirements.\r\n\r\nGetting control of the budget requires also that State and local\r\ngovernments and interested groups of citizens restrain themselves in their\r\ndemands upon the Congress that the Federal Treasury spend more and more\r\nmoney for all types of projects.\r\n\r\nA balanced budget is an essential first measure in checking further\r\ndepreciation in the buying power of the dollar. This is one of the critical\r\nsteps to be taken to bring an end to planned inflation. Our purpose is to\r\nmanage the Government's finances so as to help and not hinder each family\r\nin balancing its own budget.\r\n\r\nReduction of taxes will be justified only as we show we can succeed in\r\nbringing the budget under control. As the budget is balanced and inflation\r\nchecked, the tax burden that today stifles initiative can and must be\r\neased.\r\n\r\nUntil we can determine the extent to which expenditures can be reduced, it\r\nwould not be wise to reduce our revenues.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the tax structure as a whole demands review. The Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury is undertaking this study immediately. We must develop a\r\nsystem of taxation which will impose the least possible obstacle to the\r\ndynamic growth of the country. This includes particularly real opportunity\r\nfor the growth of small businesses. Many readjustments in existing taxes\r\nwill be necessary to serve these objectives and also to remove existing\r\ninequities. Clarification and simplification in the tax laws as well as the\r\nregulations will be undertaken.\r\n\r\nIn the entire area of fiscal policy--which must, in its various aspects, be\r\ntreated in recommendations to the Congress in coming weeks--there can now\r\nbe stated certain basic facts and principles.\r\n\r\nFirst. It is axiomatic that our economy is a highly complex and sensitive\r\nmechanism. Hasty and ill-considered action of any kind could seriously\r\nupset the subtle equation that encompasses debts, obligations,\r\nexpenditures, defense demands, deficits, taxes, and the general economic\r\nhealth of the Nation. Our goals can be clear, our start toward them can be\r\nimmediate--but action must be gradual.\r\n\r\nSecond. It is clear that too great a part of the national debt comes due in\r\ntoo short a time. The Department of the Treasury will undertake at suitable\r\ntimes a program of extending part of the debt over longer periods and\r\ngradually placing greater amounts in the hands of longer-term investors.\r\n\r\nThird. Past differences in policy between the Treasury and the Federal\r\nReserve Board have helped to encourage inflation. Henceforth, I expect that\r\ntheir single purpose shall be to serve the whole Nation by policies\r\ndesigned to stabilize the economy and encourage the free play of our\r\npeople's genius for individual initiative.\r\n\r\nIn encouraging this initiative, no single item in our current problems has\r\nreceived more thoughtful consideration by my associates, and by the many\r\nindividuals called into our counsels, than the matter of price and wage\r\ncontrol by law.\r\n\r\nThe great economic strength of our democracy has developed in an atmosphere\r\nof freedom. The character of our people resists artificial and arbitrary\r\ncontrols of any kind. Direct controls, except those on credit, deal not\r\nwith the real causes of inflation but only with its symptoms. In times of\r\nnational emergency, this kind of control has a role to play. Our whole\r\nsystem, however, is based upon the assumption that, normally, we should\r\ncombat wide fluctuations in our price structure by relying largely on the\r\neffective use of sound fiscal and monetary policy, and upon the natural\r\nworkings of economic law.\r\n\r\nMoreover, American labor and American business can best resolve their wage\r\nproblems across the bargaining table. Government should refrain from\r\nsitting in with them unless, in extreme cases, the public welfare requires\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nWe are, of course, living in an international situation that is neither an\r\nemergency demanding full mobilization, nor is it peace. No one can know how\r\nlong this condition will persist. Consequently, we are forced to learn many\r\nnew things as we go along-clinging to what works, discarding what does\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nIn all our current discussions on these and related facts, the weight of\r\nevidence is clearly against the use of controls in their present forms.\r\nThey have proved largely unsatisfactory or unworkable. They have not\r\nprevented inflation; they have not kept down the cost of living.\r\nDissatisfaction with them is wholly justified. I am convinced that now--as\r\nwell as in the long run--free and competitive prices will best serve the\r\ninterests of all the people, and best meet the changing, growing needs of\r\nour economy.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, I do not intend to ask for a renewal of the present wage and\r\nprice controls on April 30, 1953, when present legislation expires. In the\r\nmeantime, steps will be taken to eliminate controls in an orderly manner,\r\nand to terminate special agencies no longer needed for this purpose. It is\r\nobviously to be expected that the removal of these controls will result in\r\nindividual price changes--some up, some down. But a maximum of freedom in\r\nmarket prices as well as in collective bargaining is characteristic of a\r\ntruly free people.\r\n\r\nI believe also that material and product controls should be ended, except\r\nwith respect to defense priorities and scarce and critical items essential\r\nfor our defense. I shall recommend to the Congress that legislation be\r\nenacted to continue authority for such remaining controls of this type as\r\nwill be necessary after the expiration of the existing statute on June 30,\r\n1953.\r\n\r\nI recommend the continuance of the authority for Federal control over rents\r\nin those communities in which serious housing shortages exist. These are\r\nchiefly the so-called defense areas. In these and all areas the Federal\r\nGovernment should withdraw from the control of rents as soon as\r\npracticable. But before they are removed entirely, each legislature should\r\nhave full opportunity to take over, within its own State, responsibility\r\nfor this function.\r\n\r\nIt would be idle to pretend that all our problems in this whole field of\r\nprices will solve themselves by mere Federal withdrawal from direct\r\ncontrols.\r\n\r\nWe shall have to watch trends closely. If the freer functioning of our\r\neconomic system, as well as the indirect controls which can be\r\nappropriately employed, prove insufficient during this period of strain and\r\ntension, I shall promptly ask the Congress to enact such legislation as may\r\nbe required.\r\n\r\nIn facing all these problems--wages, prices, production, tax rates, fiscal\r\npolicy, deficits--everywhere we remain constantly mindful that the time for\r\nsacrifice has not ended. But we are concerned with the encouragement of\r\ncompetitive enterprise and individual initiative precisely because we know\r\nthem to be our Nation's abiding sources of strength.\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nOur vast world responsibility accents with urgency our people's elemental\r\nright to a government whose clear qualities are loyalty, security,\r\nefficiency, economy, and integrity.\r\n\r\nThe safety of America and the trust of the people alike demand that the\r\npersonnel of the Federal Government be loyal in their motives and reliable\r\nin the discharge of their duties. Only a combination of both loyalty and\r\nreliability promises genuine security.\r\n\r\nTo state this principle is easy; to apply it can be difficult. But this\r\nsecurity we must and shall have. By way of example, all principal new\r\nappointees to departments and agencies have been investigated at their own\r\nrequest by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\r\n\r\nConfident of your understanding and cooperation, I know that the primary\r\nresponsibility for keeping out the disloyal and the dangerous rests\r\nsquarely upon the executive branch. When this branch so conducts itself as\r\nto require policing by another branch of the Government, it invites its own\r\ndisorder and confusion.\r\n\r\nI am determined to meet this responsibility of the Executive. The heads of\r\nall executive departments and agencies have been instructed to initiate at\r\nonce effective programs of security with respect to their personnel. The\r\nAttorney General will advise and guide the departments and agencies in the\r\nshaping of these programs, designed at once to govern the employment of new\r\npersonnel and to review speedily any derogatory information concerning\r\nincumbent personnel.\r\n\r\nTo carry out these programs, I believe that the powers of the executive\r\nbranch under existing law are sufficient. If they should prove inadequate,\r\nthe necessary legislation will be requested.\r\n\r\nThese programs will be both fair to the rights of the individual and\r\neffective for the safety of the Nation. They will, with care and justice,\r\napply the basic principle that public employment is not a right but a\r\nprivilege.\r\n\r\nAll these measures have two clear purposes: Their first purpose is to make\r\ncertain that this Nation's security is not jeopardized by false servants.\r\nTheir second purpose is to clear the atmosphere of that unreasoned\r\nsuspicion that accepts rumor and gossip as substitutes for evidence.\r\n\r\nOur people, of course, deserve and demand of their Federal Government more\r\nthan security of personnel. They demand, also, efficient and logical\r\norganization, true to constitutional principles.\r\n\r\nI have already established a Committee on Government Organization. The\r\nCommittee is using as its point of departure the reports of the Hoover\r\nCommission and subsequent studies by several independent agencies. To\r\nachieve the greater efficiency and economy which the Committee analyses\r\nshow to be possible, I ask the Congress to extend the present Government\r\nReorganization Act for a period of 18 months or 2 years beyond its\r\nexpiration date of April 1, 1953.\r\n\r\nThere is more involved here than realigning the wheels and smoothing the\r\ngears of administrative machinery. The Congress rightfully-expects the\r\nExecutive to take the initiative in discovering and removing outmoded\r\nfunctions and eliminating duplication.\r\n\r\nOne agency, for example, whose head has promised early and vigorous action\r\nto provide greater efficiency is the Post Office. One of the oldest\r\ninstitutions of our Federal Government, its service should be of the best.\r\nIts employees should merit and receive the high regard and esteem of the\r\ncitizens of the Nation. There are today in some areas of the postal\r\nservice, both waste and incompetence to be corrected. With the cooperation\r\nof the Congress, and taking advantage of its accumulated experience in\r\npostal affairs, the Postmaster General will institute a program directed at\r\nimproving service while at the same time reducing costs and decreasing\r\ndeficits.\r\n\r\nIn all departments, dedication to these basic precepts of security and\r\nefficiency, integrity, and economy can and will produce an administration\r\ndeserving of the trust the people have placed in it.\r\n\r\nOur people have demanded nothing less than good, efficient government. They\r\nshall get nothing less.\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nVitally important are the water and minerals, public lands and standing\r\ntimber, forage and wild-life of this country. A fast-growing population will\r\nhave vast future needs in these resources. We must more than match the\r\nsubstantial achievements in the half-century since President Theodore\r\nRoosevelt awakened the Nation to the problem of conservation.\r\n\r\nThis calls for a strong Federal program in the field of resource\r\ndevelopment. Its major projects should be timed, where possible to assist\r\nin leveling off peaks and valleys in our economic life. Soundly planned\r\nprojects already initiated should be carried out. New ones will be planned\r\nfor the future.\r\n\r\nThe best natural resources program for America will not result from\r\nexclusive dependence on Federal bureaucracy. It will involve a partnership\r\nof the States and local communities, private citizens, and the Federal\r\nGovernment, all working together. This combined effort will advance the\r\ndevelopment of the great river valleys of our Nation and the power that\r\nthey can generate. Likewise, such a partnership can be effective in the\r\nexpansion throughout the Nation of upstream storage; the sound use of\r\npublic lands; the wise conservation of minerals; and the sustained yield of\r\nour forests.\r\n\r\nThere has been much criticism, some of it apparently justified, of the\r\nconfusion resulting from overlapping Federal activities in the entire field\r\nof resource-conservation. This matter is being exhaustively studied and\r\nappropriate reorganization plans will be developed.\r\n\r\nMost of these particular resource problems pertain to the Department of the\r\nInterior. Another of its major concerns is our country's island\r\npossessions. Here, one matter deserves attention. The platforms of both\r\npolitical parties promised immediate statehood to Hawaii. The people of\r\nthat Territory have earned that status. Statehood should be granted\r\npromptly with the first election scheduled for 1954.\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nOne of the difficult problems which face the new administration is that of\r\nthe slow, irregular decline of farm prices. This decline, which has been\r\ngoing on for almost 2 years, has occurred at a time when most nonfarm\r\nprices and farm costs of production are extraordinarily high.\r\n\r\nPresent agricultural legislation provides for the mandatory support of the\r\nprices of basic farm commodities at 90 percent of parity. The Secretary of\r\nAgriculture and his associates will, of course, execute the present act\r\nfaithfully and thereby seek to mitigate the consequences of the downturn in\r\nfarm income.\r\n\r\nThis price-support legislation will expire at the end of 1954.\r\n\r\nSo we should begin now to consider what farm legislation we should develop\r\nfor 1955 and beyond. Our aim should be economic stability and full parity\r\nof income for American farmers. But we must seek this goal in ways that\r\nminimize governmental interference in the farmers' affairs, that permit\r\ndesirable shifts in production, and that encourage farmers themselves to\r\nuse initiative in meeting changing economic conditions.\r\n\r\nA continuing study reveals nothing more emphatically than the complicated\r\nnature of this subject. Among other things, it shows that the prosperity of\r\nour agriculture depends directly upon the prosperity of the whole\r\ncountry--upon the purchasing power of American consumers. It depends also\r\nupon the opportunity to ship abroad large surpluses of particular\r\ncommodities, and therefore upon sound economic relationships between the\r\nUnited States and many foreign countries. It involves research and\r\nscientific investigation, conducted on an extensive scale. It involves\r\nspecial credit mechanisms and marketing, rural electrification, soil\r\nconservation, and other programs.\r\n\r\nThe whole complex of agricultural programs and policies will be studied by\r\na Special Agricultural Advisory Commission, as I know it will by\r\nappropriate committees of the Congress. A nonpartisan group of respected\r\nauthorities in the field of agriculture has already been appointed as an\r\ninterim advisory group.\r\n\r\nThe immediate changes needed in agricultural programs are largely budgetary\r\nand administrative in nature. New policies and new programs must await the\r\ncompletion of the far-reaching studies which have already been launched.\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\nThe determination of labor policy must be governed not by the vagaries of\r\npolitical expediency but by the firmest principles and convictions. Slanted\r\npartisan appeals to American workers, spoken as if they were a group apart,\r\nnecessitating a special language and treatment, are an affront to the\r\nfullness of their dignity as American citizens.\r\n\r\nThe truth in matters of labor policy has become obscured in controversy.\r\nThe very meaning of economic freedom as it affects labor has become\r\nconfused. This misunderstanding has provided a climate of opinion favoring\r\nthe growth of governmental paternalism in labor relations. This tendency,\r\nif left uncorrected, could end only by producing a bureaucratic despotism.\r\nEconomic freedom is, in fact, the requisite of greater prosperity for every\r\nAmerican who earns his own living.\r\n\r\nIn the field of labor legislation, only a law that merits the respect and\r\nsupport of both labor and management can help reduce the loss of wages and\r\nof production through strikes and stoppages, and thus add to the total\r\neconomic strength of our Nation.\r\n\r\nWe have now had 5 years' experience with the Labor Management Act of 1947,\r\ncommonly known as the Taft-Hartley Act. That experience has shown the need\r\nfor some corrective action, and we should promptly proceed to amend that\r\nact.\r\n\r\nI know that the Congress is already proceeding with renewed studies of this\r\nsubject. Meanwhile, the Department of Labor is at once beginning work to\r\ndevise further specific recommendations for your consideration.\r\n\r\nIn the careful working out of legislation, I know you will give thoughtful\r\nconsideration--as will we in the executive branch--to the views of labor,\r\nand of management, and of the general public. In this process, it is only\r\nhuman that each of us should bring forward the arguments of self-interest.\r\nBut if all conduct their arguments in the overpowering light of national\r\ninterest--which is enlightened self-interest--we shall get the right\r\nanswers. I profoundly hope that every citizen of our country will follow\r\nwith understanding your progress in this work. The welfare of all of us is\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\nEspecially must we remember that the institutions of trade unionism and\r\ncollective bargaining are monuments to the freedom that must prevail in our\r\nindustrial life. They have a century of honorable achievement behind them.\r\nOur faith in them is proven, firm, and final.\r\n\r\nGovernment can do a great deal to aid the settlement of labor disputes\r\nwithout allowing itself to be employed as an ally of either side. Its\r\nproper role in industrial strife is to encourage the processes of mediation\r\nand conciliation. These processes can successfully be directed only by a\r\ngovernment free from the taint of any suspicion that it is partial or\r\npunitive.\r\n\r\nThe administration intends to strengthen and to improve the services which\r\nthe Department of Labor can render to the worker and to the whole national\r\ncommunity. This Department was created--just 40 years ago--to serve the\r\nentire Nation. It must aid, for example, employers and employees alike in\r\nimproving training programs that will develop skilled and competent\r\nworkers. It must enjoy the confidence and respect of labor and industry in\r\norder to play a significant role in the planning of America's economic\r\nfuture. To that end, I am authorizing the Department of Labor to establish\r\npromptly a tripartite advisory committee consisting of representatives of\r\nemployers, labor, and the public.\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\nOur civil and social rights form a central part of the heritage we are\r\nstriving to defend on all fronts and with all our strength. I believe with\r\nall my heart that our vigilant guarding of these rights is a sacred\r\nobligation binding upon every citizen. To be true to one's own freedom is,\r\nin essence, to honor and respect the freedom of all others.\r\n\r\nA cardinal ideal in this heritage we cherish is the equality of rights of\r\nall citizens of every race and color and creed.\r\n\r\nWe know that discrimination against minorities persists despite our\r\nallegiance to this ideal. Such discrimination--confined to no one section\r\nof the Nation--is but the outward testimony to the persistence of distrust\r\nand of fear in the hearts of men.\r\n\r\nThis fact makes all the more vital the fighting of these wrongs by each\r\nindividual, in every station of life, in his every deed.\r\n\r\nMuch of the answer lies in the power of fact, fully publicized; of\r\npersuasion, honestly pressed; and of conscience, justly aroused. These are\r\nmethods familiar to our way of life, tested and proven wise.\r\n\r\nI propose to use whatever authority exists in the office of the President\r\nto end segregation in the District of Columbia, including the Federal\r\nGovernment, and any segregation in the Armed Forces.\r\n\r\nHere in the District of Columbia, serious attention should be given to the\r\nproposal to develop and authorize, through legislation, a system to provide\r\nan effective voice in local self-government. While consideration of this\r\nproceeds, I recommend an immediate increase of two in the number of\r\nDistrict Commissioners to broaden representation of all elements of our\r\nlocal population. This will be a first step toward insuring that this\r\nCapital provide an honored example to all communities of our Nation.\r\n\r\nIn this manner, and by the leadership of the office of the President\r\nexercised through friendly conferences with those in authority in our\r\nStates and cities, we expect to make true and rapid progress in civil\r\nrights and equality of employment opportunity.\r\n\r\nThere is one sphere in which civil rights are inevitably involved in\r\nFederal legislation. This is the sphere of immigration.\r\n\r\nIt is a manifest right of our Government to limit the number of immigrants\r\nour Nation can absorb. It is also a manifest right of our Government to set\r\nreasonable requirements on the character and the numbers of the people who\r\ncome to share our land and our freedom.\r\n\r\nIt is well for us, however, to remind ourselves occasionally of an equally\r\nmanifest fact: we are--one and all--immigrants or sons and daughters of\r\nimmigrants.\r\n\r\nExisting legislation contains injustices. It does, in fact, discriminate. I\r\nam informed by Members of the Congress that it was realized, at the time of\r\nits enactment, that future study of the basis of determining quotas would\r\nbe necessary.\r\n\r\nI am therefore requesting the Congress to review this legislation and to\r\nenact a statute that will at one and the same time guard our legitimate\r\nnational interests and be faithful to our basic ideas of freedom and\r\nfairness to all.\r\n\r\nIn another but related area--that of social rights--we see most clearly the\r\nnew application of old ideas of freedom.\r\n\r\nThis administration is profoundly aware of two great needs born of our\r\nliving in a complex industrial economy. First, the individual citizen must\r\nhave safeguards against personal disaster inflicted by forces beyond his\r\ncontrol; second, the welfare of the people demands effective and economical\r\nperformance by the Government of certain indispensable social services.\r\n\r\nIn the light of this responsibility, certain general purposes and certain\r\nconcrete measures are plainly indicated now.\r\n\r\nThere is urgent need for greater effectiveness in our programs, both public\r\nand private, offering safeguards against the privations that too often come\r\nwith unemployment, old age, illness, and accident. The provisions of the\r\nold-age and survivors insurance law should promptly be extended to cover\r\nmillions of citizens who have been left out of the social-security system.\r\nNo less important is the encouragement of privately sponsored pension\r\nplans. Most important of all, of course, is renewed effort to check the\r\ninflation which destroys so much of the value of all social-security\r\npayments.\r\n\r\nOur school system demands some prompt, effective help. During each of the\r\nlast 9 years, more than 1 1/2 million children have swelled the elementary\r\nand secondary school population of the country. Generally, the school\r\npopulation is proportionately higher in States with low per capita income.\r\nThis whole situation calls for careful congressional study and action. I am\r\nsure that you share my conviction that the firm conditions of Federal aid\r\nmust be proved need and proved lack of local income.\r\n\r\nOne phase of the school problem demands special action. The school\r\npopulation of many districts has been greatly increased by the swift\r\ngrowth of defense activities. These activities have added little or nothing\r\nto the tax resources of the communities affected. Legislation aiding\r\nconstruction of schools in the districts expires on June 30. This law\r\nshould be renewed; and likewise, the partial payments for current operating\r\nexpenses for these particular school districts should be made, including\r\nthe deficiency requirement of the current fiscal year.\r\n\r\nPublic interest similarly demands one prompt specific action in protection\r\nof the general consumer. The Food and Drug Administration should be\r\nauthorized to continue its established and necessary program of factory\r\ninspections. The invalidation of these inspections by the Supreme Court of\r\nDecember 8, 1952, was based solely on the fact that the present law\r\ncontained inconsistent and unclear provisions. These must be promptly\r\ncorrected.\r\n\r\nI am well aware that beyond these few immediate measures there remains much\r\nto be done. The health and housing needs of our people call for\r\nintelligently planned programs. Involved are the solvency of the whole\r\nsecurity system; and its guarding against exploitation by the\r\nirresponsible.\r\n\r\nTo bring clear purpose and orderly procedure into this field, I anticipate\r\na thorough study of the proper relationship among Federal, State, and local\r\nprograms. I shall shortly send you specific recommendations for\r\nestablishing such an appropriate commission, together with a reorganization\r\nplan defining new administrative status for all Federal activities in\r\nhealth, education, and social security.\r\n\r\nI repeat that there are many important subjects of which I make no mention\r\ntoday. Among these is our great and growing body of veterans. America has\r\ntraditionally been generous in caring for the disabled--and the widow and\r\nthe orphan of the fallen. These millions remain close to all our hearts.\r\nProper care of our uniformed citizens and appreciation of the past service\r\nof our veterans are part of our accepted governmental responsibilities.\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nWe have surveyed briefly some problems of our people and a portion of the\r\ntasks before us.\r\n\r\nThe hope of freedom itself depends, in real measure, upon our strength, our\r\nheart, and our wisdom.\r\n\r\nWe must be strong in arms. We must be strong in the source of all our\r\narmament, our productivity. We all--workers and farmers, foremen and\r\nfinanciers, technicians and builders--all must produce, produce more, and\r\nproduce yet more.\r\n\r\nWe must be strong, above all, in the spiritual resources upon which all\r\nelse depends. We must be devoted with all our heart to the values we\r\ndefend. We must know that each of these values and virtues applies with\r\nequal force at the ends of the earth and in our relations with our neighbor\r\nnext door. We must know that freedom expresses itself with equal eloquence\r\nin the right of workers to strike in the nearby factory, and in the\r\nyearnings and sufferings of the peoples of Eastern Europe.\r\n\r\nAs our heart summons our strength, our wisdom must direct it.\r\n\r\nThere is, in world affairs, a steady course to be followed between an\r\nassertion of strength that is truculent and a confession of helplessness\r\nthat is cowardly.\r\n\r\nThere is, in our affairs at home, a middle way between untrammeled freedom\r\nof the individual and the demands for the welfare of the whole Nation. This\r\nway must avoid government by bureaucracy as carefully as it avoids neglect\r\nof the helpless.\r\n\r\nIn every area of political action, free men must think before they can\r\nexpect to win.\r\n\r\nIn this spirit must we live and labor: confident of our strength,\r\ncompassionate in our heart, clear in our mind.\r\n\r\nIn this spirit, let us together turn to the great tasks before us.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nDwight D. Eisenhower\r\nJanuary 7, 1954\r\n\r\nMr. President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the Eighty-third Congress:\r\n\r\nIt is a high honor again to present to the Congress my views on the state\r\nof the Union and to recommend measures to advance the security, prosperity,\r\nand well-being of the American people.\r\n\r\nAll branches of this Government--and I venture to say both of our great\r\nparties--can support the general objective of the recommendations I make\r\ntoday, for that objective is the building of a stronger America. A nation\r\nwhose every citizen has good reason for bold hope; where effort is rewarded\r\nand prosperity is shared; where freedom expands and peace is secure--that\r\nis what I mean by a stronger America.\r\n\r\nToward this objective a real momentum has been developed during this\r\nAdministration's first year in office. We mean to continue that momentum\r\nand to increase it. We mean to build a better future for this nation.\r\n\r\nMuch for which we may be thankful has happened during the past year.\r\n\r\nFirst of all we are deeply grateful that our sons no longer die on the\r\ndistant mountains of Korea. Although they are still called from our homes\r\nto military service, they are no longer called to the field of battle.\r\n\r\nThe nation has just completed the most prosperous year in its history. The\r\ndamaging effect of inflation on the wages, pensions, salaries and savings\r\nof us all has been brought under control. Taxes have begun to go down. The\r\ncost of our government has been reduced and its work proceeds with some\r\n183,000 fewer employees; thus the discouraging trend of modern governments\r\ntoward their own limitless expansion has in our case been reversed. The\r\ncost of armaments becomes less oppressive as we near our defense goals; yet\r\nwe are militarily stronger every day. During the year, creation of the new\r\nCabinet Department of Health, Education, and Welfare symbolized the\r\ngovernment's permanent concern with the human problems of our citizens.\r\n\r\nSegregation in the armed forces and other Federal activities is on the way\r\nout. We have also made progress toward its elimination in the District of\r\nColumbia. These are steps in the continuing effort to eliminate\r\ninter-racial difficulty.\r\n\r\nSome developments beyond our shores have been equally encouraging.\r\nCommunist aggression, halted in Korea, continues to meet in Indo-china the\r\nvigorous resistance of France and the Associated States, assisted by timely\r\naid from our country. In West Germany, in Iran, and in other areas of the\r\nworld, heartening political victories have been won by the forces of\r\nstability and freedom. Slowly but surely, the free world gathers strength.\r\nMeanwhile, from behind the iron curtain, there are signs that tyranny is in\r\ntrouble and reminders that its structure is as brittle as its surface is\r\nhard.\r\n\r\nThere has been in fact a great strategic change in the world during the\r\npast year. That precious intangible, the initiative, is becoming ours. Our\r\npolicy, not limited to mere reaction against crises provoked by others, is\r\nfree to develop along lines of our choice not only abroad, but also at\r\nhome. As a major theme for American policy during the coming year, let our\r\njoint determination be to hold this new initiative and to use it.\r\n\r\nWe shall use this initiative to promote three broad purposes: First, to\r\nprotect the freedom of our people; second, to maintain a strong, growing\r\neconomy; third, to concern ourselves with the human problems of the\r\nindividual citizen.\r\n\r\nOnly by active concern for each of these purposes can we be sure that we\r\nare on the forward road to a better and a stronger America. All my\r\nrecommendations today are in furtherance of these three purposes.\r\n\r\nI. FOREIGN AFFAIRS\r\n\r\nAmerican freedom is threatened so long as the world Communist conspiracy\r\nexists in its present scope, power and hostility. More closely than ever\r\nbefore, American freedom is interlocked with the freedom of other people.\r\nIn the unity of the free world lies our best chance to reduce the Communist\r\nthreat without war. In the task of maintaining this unity and strengthening\r\nall its parts, the greatest responsibility falls naturally on those who,\r\nlike ourselves, retain the most freedom and strength.\r\n\r\nWe shall, therefore, continue to advance the cause of freedom on foreign\r\nfronts.\r\n\r\nIn the Far East, we retain our vital interest in Korea. We have negotiated\r\nwith the Republic of Korea a mutual security pact, which develops our\r\nsecurity system for the Pacific and which I shall promptly submit to the\r\nSenate for its consent to ratification. We are prepared to meet any renewal\r\nof armed aggression in Korea. We shall maintain indefinitely our bases in\r\nOkinawa. I shall ask the Congress to authorize continued material\r\nassistance to hasten the successful conclusion of the struggle in\r\nIndo-china. This assistance will also bring closer the day when the\r\nAssociated States may enjoy the independence already assured by France. We\r\nshall also continue military and economic aid to the Nationalist Government\r\nof China.\r\n\r\nIn South Asia, profound changes are taking place in free nations which are\r\ndemonstrating their ability to progress through democratic methods. They\r\nprovide an inspiring contrast to the dictatorial methods and backward\r\ncourse of events in Communist China. In these continuing efforts, the free\r\npeoples of South Asia can be assured of the support of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn the Middle East, where tensions and serious problems exist, we will show\r\nsympathetic and impartial friendship.\r\n\r\nIn Western Europe our policy rests firmly on the North Atlantic Treaty. It\r\nwill remain so based as far ahead as we can see. Within its organization,\r\nthe building of a united European community, including France and Germany,\r\nis vital to a free and self-reliant Europe. This will be promoted by the\r\nEuropean Defense Community which offers assurance of European security.\r\nWith the coming of unity to Western Europe, the assistance this Nation can\r\nrender for the security of Europe and the free world will be multiplied in\r\neffectiveness.\r\n\r\nIn the Western Hemisphere we shall continue to develop harmonious and\r\nmutually beneficial cooperation with our neighbors. Indeed, solid\r\nfriendship with all our American neighbors is a cornerstone of our entire\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nIn the world as a whole, the United Nations, admittedly still in a state of\r\nevolution, means much to the United States. It has given uniquely valuable\r\nservices in many places where violence threatened. It is the only real\r\nworld forum where we have the opportunity for international presentation\r\nand rebuttal. It is a place where the nations of the world can, if they\r\nhave the will, take collective action for peace and justice. It is a place\r\nwhere the guilt can be squarely assigned to those who fail to take all\r\nnecessary steps to keep the peace. The United Nations deserves our\r\ncontinued firm support.\r\n\r\nFOREIGN ASSISTANCE AND TRADE\r\n\r\nIn the practical application of our foreign policy, we enter the field of\r\nforeign assistance and trade.\r\n\r\nMilitary assistance must be continued. Technical assistance must be\r\nmaintained. Economic assistance can be reduced. However, our economic\r\nprograms in Korea and in a few other critical places of the world are\r\nespecially important, and I shall ask Congress to continue them in the next\r\nfiscal year.\r\n\r\nThe forthcoming Budget Message will propose maintenance of the Presidential\r\npower of transferability of all assistance funds and will ask authority to\r\nmerge these funds with the regular defense funds. It will also propose that\r\nthe Secretary of Defense have primary responsibility for the administration\r\nof foreign military assistance in accordance with the policy guidance of\r\nthe Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nThe fact that we can now reduce our foreign economic assistance in many\r\nareas is gratifying evidence that its objectives are being achieved. By\r\ncontinuing to surpass her prewar levels of economic activity, Western\r\nEurope gains self-reliance. Thus our relationship enters a new phase which\r\ncan bring results beneficial to our taxpayers and our allies alike, if\r\nstill another step is taken.\r\n\r\nThis step is the creation of a healthier and freer system of trade and\r\npayments within the free world--a system in which our allies can earn their\r\nown way and our own economy can continue to flourish. The free world can no\r\nlonger afford the kinds of arbitrary restraints on trade that have\r\ncontinued ever since the war. On this problem I shall submit to the\r\nCongress detailed recommendations, after our Joint Commission on Foreign\r\nEconomic Policy has made its report.\r\n\r\nATOMIC ENERGY PROPOSAL\r\n\r\nAs we maintain our military strength during the coming year and draw closer\r\nthe bonds with our allies, we shall be in an improved position to discuss\r\noutstanding issues with the Soviet Union. Indeed we shall be glad to do so\r\nwhenever there is a reasonable prospect of constructive results. In this\r\nspirit the atomic energy proposals of the United States were recently\r\npresented to the United Nations General Assembly. A truly constructive\r\nSoviet reaction will make possible a new start toward an era of peace, and\r\naway from the fatal road toward atomic war.\r\n\r\nDEFENSE\r\n\r\nSince our hope is peace, we owe ourselves and the world a candid\r\nexplanation of the military measures we are taking to make that peace\r\nsecure.\r\n\r\nAs we enter this new year, our military power continues to grow. This power\r\nis for our own defense and to deter aggression. We shall not be aggressors,\r\nbut we and our allies have and will maintain a massive capability to strike\r\nback.\r\n\r\nHere are some of the considerations in our defense planning:\r\n\r\nFirst, while determined to use atomic power to serve the usages of peace,\r\nwe take into full account our great and growing number of nuclear weapons\r\nand the most effective means of using them against an aggressor if they are\r\nneeded to preserve our freedom. Our defense will be stronger if, under\r\nappropriate security safeguards, we share with our allies certain knowledge\r\nof the tactical use of our nuclear weapons. I urge the Congress to provide\r\nthe needed authority.\r\n\r\nSecond, the usefulness of these new weapons creates new relationships\r\nbetween men and materials. These new relationships permit economies in the\r\nuse of men as we build forces suited to our situation in the world today.\r\nAs will be seen from the Budget Message on January 21, the airpower of our\r\nNavy and Air Force is receiving heavy emphasis.\r\n\r\nThird, our armed forces must regain maximum mobility of action. Our\r\nstrategic reserves must be centrally placed and readily deployable to meet\r\nsudden aggression against ourselves and our allies.\r\n\r\nFourth, our defense must rest on trained manpower and its most economical\r\nand mobile use. A professional corps is the heart of any security\r\norganization. It is necessarily the teacher and leader of those who serve\r\ntemporarily in the discharge of the obligation to help defend the Republic.\r\nPay alone will not retain in the career service of our armed forces the\r\nnecessary numbers of long-term personnel. I strongly urge, therefore, a\r\nmore generous use of other benefits important to service morale. Among\r\nthese are more adequate living quarters and family housing units and\r\nmedical care for dependents.\r\n\r\nStudies of military manpower have just been completed by the National\r\nSecurity Training Commission and a Committee appointed by the Director of\r\nthe Office of Defense Mobilization. Evident weaknesses exist in the state\r\nof readiness and organization of our reserve forces. Measures to correct\r\nthese weaknesses will be later submitted to the Congress.\r\n\r\nFifth, the ability to convert swiftly from partial to all-out mobilization\r\nis imperative to our security. For the first time, mobilization officials\r\nknow what the requirements are for 1,000 major items needed for military\r\nuses. These data, now being related to civilian requirements and our supply\r\npotential, will show us the gaps in our mobilization base. Thus we shall\r\nhave more realistic plant-expansion and stockpiling goals. We shall speed\r\ntheir attainment. This Nation is at last to have an up-to-date mobilization\r\nbase--the foundation of a sound defense program.\r\n\r\nAnother part of this foundation is, of course, our continental transport\r\nsystem. Some of our vital heavy materials come increasingly from Canada.\r\nIndeed our relations with Canada, happily always close, involve more and\r\nmore the unbreakable ties of strategic interdependence. Both nations now\r\nneed the St. Lawrence Seaway for security as well as for economic reasons.\r\nI urge the Congress promptly to approve our participation in its\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\nSixth, military and non-military measures for continental defense must be\r\nand are being strengthened. In the current fiscal year we are allocating to\r\nthese purposes an increasing portion of our effort, and in the next fiscal\r\nyear we shall spend nearly a billion dollars more for them than in 1953.\r\n\r\nAn indispensable part of our continental security is our civil defense\r\neffort. This will succeed only as we have the complete cooperation of State\r\nGovernors, Mayors, and voluntary citizen groups. With their help we can\r\nadvance a cooperative program which, if an attack should come, would save\r\nmany lives and lessen destruction.\r\n\r\nThe defense program recommended in the 1955 Budget is consistent with all\r\nof the considerations which I have just discussed. It is based on a new\r\nmilitary program unanimously recommended by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and\r\napproved by me following consideration by the National Security Council.\r\nThis new program will make and keep America strong in an age of peril.\r\nNothing should bar its attainment.\r\n\r\nThe international and defense policies which I have outlined will enable us\r\nto negotiate from a position of strength as we hold our resolute course\r\ntoward a peaceful world. We now turn to matters which are normally\r\ncharacterized as domestic, well realizing that what we do abroad affects\r\nevery problem at home--from the amount of taxes to our very state of mind.\r\n\r\nINTERNAL SECURITY\r\n\r\nUnder the standards established for the new employee security program, more\r\nthan 2,200 employees have been separated from the Federal government. Our\r\nnational security demands that the investigation of new employees and the\r\nevaluation of derogatory information respecting present employees be\r\nexpedited and concluded at the earliest possible date. I shall recommend\r\nthat the Congress provide additional funds where necessary to speed these\r\nimportant procedures.\r\n\r\nFrom the special employment standards of the Federal government I turn now\r\nto a matter relating to American citizenship. The subversive character of\r\nthe Communist Party in the United States has been clearly demonstrated in\r\nmany ways, including court proceedings. We should recognize by law a fact\r\nthat is plain to all thoughtful citizens-that we are dealing here with\r\nactions akin to treason--that when a citizen knowingly participates in the\r\nCommunist conspiracy he no longer holds allegiance to the United States.\r\n\r\nI recommend that Congress enact legislation to provide that a citizen of\r\nthe United States who is convicted in the courts of hereafter conspiring to\r\nadvocate the overthrow of this government by force or violence be treated\r\nas having, by such act, renounced his allegiance to the United States and\r\nforfeited his United States citizenship.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Attorney General will soon appear before your Committees\r\nto present his recommendations for needed additional legal weapons with\r\nwhich to combat subversion in our country and to deal with the question of\r\nclaimed immunity.\r\n\r\nII. STRONG ECONOMY\r\n\r\nI turn now to the second great purpose of our government: Along with the\r\nprotection of freedom, the maintenance of a strong and growing economy.\r\n\r\nThe American economy is one of the wonders of the world. It undergirds our\r\ninternational position, our military security, and the standard of living\r\nof every citizen. This Administration is determined to keep our economy\r\nstrong and to keep it growing.\r\n\r\nAt this moment we are in transition from a wartime to a peacetime economy.\r\nI am confident that we can complete this transition without serious\r\ninterruption in our economic growth. But we shall not leave this vital\r\nmatter to chance. Economic preparedness is fully as important to the nation\r\nas military preparedness.\r\n\r\nSubsequent special messages and the economic report on January 28 will set\r\nforth plans of the Administration and its recommendations for Congressional\r\naction. These will include flexible credit and debt management policies;\r\ntax measures to stimulate consumer and business spending; suitable lending,\r\nguaranteeing, insuring, and grant-in-aid activities; strengthened old-age\r\nand unemployment insurance measures; improved agricultural programs;\r\npublic-works plans laid well in advance; enlarged opportunities for\r\ninternational trade and investment. This mere enumeration of these subjects\r\nimplies the vast amount of study, coordination, and planning, to say\r\nnothing of authorizing legislation, that altogether make our economic\r\npreparedness complete.\r\n\r\nIf new conditions arise that require additional administrative or\r\nlegislative action, the Administration will still be ready. A government\r\nalways ready, as this is, to take well-timed and vigorous action, and a\r\nbusiness community willing, as ours is, to plan boldly and with\r\nconfidence, can between them develop a climate assuring steady economic\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nTHE BUDGET\r\n\r\nI shall submit to the Congress on January 21 the first budget prepared by\r\nthis Administration, for the period July 1, 1954, through June 1955. This\r\nbudget is adequate to the current needs of the government. It recognizes\r\nthat a Federal budget should be a stabilizing factor in the economy. Its\r\ntax and expenditure programs will foster individual initiative and economic\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nPending the transmittal of my Budget Message, I shall mention here only a\r\nfew points about our budgetary situation.\r\n\r\nFirst, one of our initial acts was to revise, with the cooperation of the\r\nCongress, the Budget prepared before this Administration took office.\r\nRequests for new appropriations were greatly reduced. In addition, the\r\nspending level provided in that Budget for the current fiscal year has been\r\nreduced by about $7,000,000,000. In the next fiscal year we estimate a\r\nfurther reduction in expenditures of more than $5,000,000,000. This will\r\nreduce the spending level over the two fiscal years by more than\r\n$12,000,000,000. We are also reducing further our requests for new\r\nappropriations.\r\n\r\nSecond, despite the substantial loss of revenue in the coming fiscal year,\r\nresulting from tax reductions now in effect and tax adjustments which I\r\nshall propose, our reduced spending will move the new budget closer to a\r\nbalance.\r\n\r\nThird, by keeping new appropriation requests below estimated revenues, we\r\ncontinue to reduce the tremendous accumulation of unfinanced obligations\r\nincurred by the Government under past appropriations.\r\n\r\nFourth, until those claims on our Government's revenues are further\r\nreduced, the growth in the public debt cannot be entirely stopped. Because\r\nof this--because the government's bills have to be paid every month, while\r\nthe tax money to pay them comes in with great unevenness within the fiscal\r\nyear--and because of the need for flexibility to manage this enormous debt,\r\nI find it necessary to renew my request for an increase in the statutory\r\ndebt limit.\r\n\r\nTAXES\r\n\r\nThe new budget provides for a lower level of taxation than has prevailed in\r\npreceding years. Six days ago individual income taxes were reduced and the\r\nexcess profits tax expired. These tax reductions are justified only because\r\nof the substantial reductions we already have made and are making in\r\ngovernmental expenditures. As additional reductions in expenditures are\r\nbrought gradually but surely into sight, further reductions in taxes can\r\nand will be made. When budget savings and sound governmental financing are\r\nassured, tax burdens should be reduced so that taxpayers may spend their\r\nown money in their own way.\r\n\r\nWhile we are moving toward lower levels of taxation we must thoroughly\r\nrevise our whole tax system. The groundwork for this revision has already\r\nbeen laid by the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, in close consultation with the Department of the Treasury.\r\nWe should now remove the more glaring tax inequities, particularly on small\r\ntaxpayers; reduce restraints on the growth of small business; and make\r\nother changes that will encourage initiative, enterprise and production.\r\nTwenty-five recommendations toward these ends will be contained in my\r\nbudget message.\r\n\r\nWithout attempting to summarize these manifold reforms, I can here\r\nillustrate their tendency. For example, we propose more liberal tax\r\ntreatment for dependent children who work, for widows or widowers with\r\ndependent children, and for medical expenses. For the business that wants\r\nto expand or modernize its plant, we propose liberalized tax treatment of\r\ndepreciation, research and development expenses, and retained earnings.\r\n\r\nBecause of the present need for revenue the corporation income tax should\r\nbe kept at the current rate of 52% for another year, and the excise taxes\r\nscheduled to be reduced on April first, including those on liquor, tobacco,\r\ngasoline and automobiles, should be continued at present rates.\r\n\r\nImmediate extension of the Renegotiation Act of 1951 is also needed to\r\neliminate excessive profits and to prevent waste of public funds in the\r\npurchase of defense materials.\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURE\r\n\r\nThe well being of our 160 million people demands a stable and prosperous\r\nagriculture. Conversely, every farmer knows he cannot prosper unless all\r\nAmerica prospers. As we seek to promote increases in our standard of\r\nliving, we must be sure that the farmer fairly shares in that increase.\r\nTherefore, a farm program promoting stability and prosperity in all\r\nelements of our agriculture is urgently needed.\r\n\r\nAgricultural laws now in effect successfully accomplished their wartime\r\npurpose of encouraging maximum production of many crops. Today, production\r\nof these crops at such levels far exceeds present demand. Yet the laws\r\nencouraging such production are still in effect. The storage facilities of\r\nthe Commodity Credit Corporation bulge with surplus stocks of dairy\r\nproducts, wheat, cotton, corn, and certain vegetable oils; and the\r\nCorporation's presently authorized borrowing authority--$6,750,000,000--is\r\nnearly exhausted. Some products, priced out of domestic markets, and\r\nothers, priced out of world markets, have piled up in government hands. In\r\na world in which millions of people are hungry, destruction of food would,\r\nof course, be unconscionable. Yet surplus stocks continue to threaten the\r\nmarket and in spite of the acreage controls authorized by present law,\r\nsurpluses will continue to accumulate.\r\n\r\nWe confront two alternatives. The first is to impose still greater acreage\r\nreductions for some crops and apply rigid Federal controls over the use of\r\nthe diverted acres. This will regiment the production of every basic\r\nagricultural crop. It will place every producer of those crops under the\r\ndomination and control of the Federal government in Washington. This\r\nalternative is contrary to the fundamental interests, not only of the\r\nfarmer, but of the Nation as a whole. Nor is it a real solution to the\r\nproblem facing us.\r\n\r\nThe second alternative is to permit the market price for these agricultural\r\nproducts gradually to have a greater influence on the planning of\r\nproduction by farmers, while continuing the assistance of the government.\r\nThis is the sound approach. To make it effective, surpluses existing when\r\nthe new program begins must be insulated from the normal channels of trade\r\nfor special uses. These uses would include school lunch programs, disaster\r\nrelief, emergency assistance to foreign friends, and of particular\r\nimportance the stockpiling of reserves for a national emergency.\r\n\r\nBuilding on the agricultural laws of 1948 and 1949, we should establish a\r\nprice support program with enough flexibility to attract the production of\r\nneeded supplies of essential commodities and to stimulate the consumption\r\nof those commodities that are flooding American markets. Transition to\r\nmodernized parity must be accomplished gradually. In no case should there\r\nbe an abrupt downward change in the dollar level or in the percentage level\r\nof price supports.\r\n\r\nNext Monday I shall transmit to the Congress my detailed recommendations\r\nembodying this approach. They have been developed through the cooperation\r\nof innumerable individuals vitally interested in agriculture. My special\r\nmessage on Monday will briefly describe the consultative and advisory\r\nprocesses to which this whole program has been subjected during the past\r\nten months.\r\n\r\nI have chosen this farm program because it will build markets, protect the\r\nconsumers' food supply, and move food into consumption instead of into\r\nstorage. It is a program that will remove the threat to the farmer of these\r\noverhanging surpluses, a program, also, that will stimulate production when\r\na commodity is scarce and encourage consumption when nature is bountiful.\r\nMoreover, it will promote the individual freedom, responsibility, and\r\ninitiative which distinguish American agriculture. And, by helping our\r\nagriculture achieve full parity in the market, it promises our farmers a\r\nhigher and steadier financial return over the years than any alternative\r\nplan.\r\n\r\nCONSERVATION\r\n\r\nPart of our Nation's precious heritage is its natural resources. It is the\r\ncommon responsibility of Federal, state, and local governments to improve\r\nand develop them, always working in the closest harmony and partnership.\r\n\r\nAll Federal conservation and resource development projects are being\r\nreappraised. Sound projects now under way will be continued. New projects\r\nin which the Federal Government has a part must be economically sound, with\r\nlocal sharing of cost wherever appropriate and feasible. In the next fiscal\r\nyear work will be started on twenty-three projects that meet these\r\nstandards. The Federal Government will continue to construct and operate\r\neconomically sound flood control, power, irrigation and water supply\r\nprojects wherever these projects are beyond the capacity of local\r\ninitiative, public or private, and consistent with the needs of the whole\r\nNation.\r\n\r\nOur conservation program will also take into account the important role\r\nplayed by farmers in protecting our soil resources. I recommend enactment\r\nof legislation to strengthen agricultural conservation and upstream flood\r\nprevention work, and to achieve a better balance with major flood control\r\nstructures in the down-stream areas.\r\n\r\nRecommendations will be made from time to time for the adoption of:\r\n\r\nA uniform and consistent water resources policy;\r\n\r\nA revised public lands policy; and\r\n\r\nA sound program for safeguarding the domestic production of critical and\r\nstrategic metals and minerals.\r\n\r\nIn addition we shall continue to protect and improve our national forests,\r\nparks, monuments and other natural and historic sites, as well as our\r\nfishery and wildlife resources. I hope that pending legislation to improve\r\nthe conservation and management of publicly-owned grazing lands in national\r\nforests will soon be approved by the Congress.\r\n\r\nNATIONAL HIGHWAYS\r\n\r\nTo protect the vital interest of every citizen in a safe and adequate\r\nhighway system, the Federal Government is continuing its central role in\r\nthe Federal Aid Highway Program. So that maximum progress can be made to\r\novercome present inadequacies in the Interstate Highway System, we must\r\ncontinue the Federal gasoline tax at two cents per gallon. This will\r\nrequire cancellation of the 1/2 cent decrease which otherwise will become\r\neffective April 1st, and will maintain revenues so that an expanded highway\r\nprogram can be undertaken.\r\n\r\nWhen the Commission on Intergovernmental Relations completes its study of\r\nthe present system of financing highway construction, I shall promptly\r\nsubmit it for consideration by the Congress and the governors of the\r\nstates.\r\n\r\nPOST OFFICE\r\n\r\nIt is apparent that the substantial savings already made, and to be made,\r\nby the Post Office Department cannot eliminate the postal deficit. I\r\nrecommend, therefore, that the Congress approve the bill now pending in the\r\nHouse of Representatives providing for the adjustment of certain postal\r\nrates. To handle the long term aspects of this, I also recommend that the\r\nCongress create a permanent commission to establish fair and reasonable\r\npostal rates from time to time in the future.\r\n\r\nIII. HUMAN PROBLEMS\r\n\r\nAlong with the protection of freedom and maintenance of a strong and\r\ngrowing economy, this Administration recognizes a third great purpose of\r\ngovernment: concern for the human problems of our citizens. In a modern\r\nindustrial society, banishment of destitution and cushioning the shock of\r\npersonal disaster on the individual are proper concerns of all levels of\r\ngovernment, including the federal government. This is especially true where\r\nremedy and prevention alike are beyond the individual's capacity.\r\n\r\nLABOR AND WELFARE\r\n\r\nOf the many problems in this area, those I shall first discuss are of\r\nparticular concern to the members of our great labor force, who with their\r\nheads, hearts and hands produce so much of the wealth of our country.\r\n\r\nProtection against the hazards of temporary unemployment should be extended\r\nto some 6 1/2 millions of workers, including civilian Federal workers, who\r\nnow lack this safeguard. Moreover, the Secretary of Labor is making\r\navailable to the states studies and recommendations in the fields of weekly\r\nbenefits, periods of protection and extension of coverage. The Economic\r\nReport will consider the related matter of minimum wages and their coverage.\r\n\r\nThe Labor Management Relations Act of 3947 is basically a sound law.\r\nHowever, six years of experience have revealed that in some respects it can\r\nbe improved. On January 11, I shall forward to the Congress suggestions for\r\nchanges designed to reinforce the basic objectives of the Act.\r\n\r\nOur basic social security program, the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance\r\nsystem, to which individuals contribute during their productive years and\r\nreceive benefits based on previous earnings, is designed to shield them\r\nfrom destitution. Last year I recommended extension of the social insurance\r\nsystem to include more than 10,000,000 additional persons. I ask that this\r\nextension soon be accomplished. This and other major improvements in the\r\ninsurance system will bring substantial benefit increases and broaden the\r\nmembership of the insurance system, thus diminishing the need for Federal\r\ngrants-in-aid for such purposes. A new formula will therefore be proposed,\r\npermitting progressive reduction in such grants as the need for them\r\ndeclines.\r\n\r\nFederal grant-in-aid welfare programs, now based on widely varying\r\nformulas, should be simplified. Concrete proposals on fourteen of them will\r\nbe suggested to the appropriate Committees.\r\n\r\nThe program for rehabilitation of the disabled especially needs\r\nstrengthening. Through special vocational training, this program presently\r\nreturns each year some 60,000 handicapped individuals to productive work.\r\nFar more disabled people can be saved each year from idleness and\r\ndependence if this program is gradually increased. My more detailed\r\nrecommendations on this and the other social insurance problems I have\r\nmentioned will be sent to the Congress on January 14th.\r\n\r\nHEALTH\r\n\r\nI am flatly opposed to the socialization of medicine. The great need for\r\nhospital and medical services can best be met by the initiative of private\r\nplans. But it is unfortunately a fact that medical costs are rising and\r\nalready impose severe hardships on many families. The Federal Government\r\ncan do many helpful things and still carefully avoid the socialization of\r\nmedicine.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Government should encourage medical research in its battle with\r\nsuch mortal diseases as cancer and heart ailments, and should continue to\r\nhelp the states in their health and rehabilitation programs. The present\r\nHospital Survey and Construction Act should be broadened in order to assist\r\nin the development of adequate facilities for the chronically ill, and to\r\nencourage the construction of diagnostic centers, rehabilitation\r\nfacilities, and nursing homes. The war on disease also needs a better\r\nworking relationship between Government and private initiative. Private and\r\nnon-profit hospital and medical insurance plans are already in the field,\r\nsoundly based on the experience and initiative of the people in their\r\nvarious communities.\r\n\r\nA limited Government reinsurance service would permit the private and\r\nnon-profit insurance companies to offer broader protection to more of the\r\nmany families which want and should have it. On January 18 I shall forward\r\nto the Congress a special message presenting this Administration's health\r\nprogram in its detail.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION\r\n\r\nYouth--our greatest resource--is being seriously neglected in a vital\r\nrespect. The nation as a whole is not preparing teachers or building\r\nschools fast enough to keep up with the increase in our population.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of teachers as, indeed, the control and direction of public\r\neducation policy, is a state and local responsibility. However, the Federal\r\nGovernment should stand ready to assist states which demonstrably cannot\r\nprovide sufficient school buildings. In order to appraise the needs, I hope\r\nthat this year a conference on education will be held in each state,\r\nculminating in a national conference. From these conferences on education,\r\nevery level of government--from the Federal Government to each local school\r\nboard--should gain the information with which to attack this serious\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nHOUSING\r\n\r\nThe details of a program to enlarge and improve the opportunities for our\r\npeople to acquire good homes will be presented to the Congress by special\r\nmessage on January 25.\r\n\r\nThis program will include:\r\n\r\nModernization of the home mortgage insurance program of the Federal\r\nGovernment;\r\n\r\nRedirection of the present system of loans and grants-in-aid to cities for\r\nslum clearance and redevelopment;\r\n\r\nExtension of the advantages of insured lending to private credit engaged in\r\nthis task of rehabilitating obsolete neighborhoods;\r\n\r\nInsurance of long-term, mortgage loans, with small down payment for\r\nlow-income families; and, until alternative programs prove more effective,\r\n\r\nContinuation of the public housing program adopted in the Housing Act of\r\n1949.\r\n\r\nIf the individual, the community, the State and federal governments will\r\nalike apply themselves, every American family can have a decent home.\r\n\r\nVETERANS ADMINISTRATION\r\n\r\nThe internal reorganization of the Veterans Administration is proceeding\r\nwith my full approval. When completed, it will afford a single agency whose\r\nservices, including medical facilities, will be better adapted to the needs\r\nof those 20,000,000 veterans to whom this Nation owes so much.\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE\r\n\r\nMy few remaining recommendations all relate to a basic right of our\r\ncitizens--that of being represented in the decisions of the government.\r\n\r\nI hope that the States will cooperate with the Congress in adopting uniform\r\nstandards in their voting laws that will make it possible for our citizens\r\nin the armed forces overseas to vote.\r\n\r\nIn the District of Columbia the time is long overdue for granting national\r\nsuffrage to its citizens and also applying the principle of local\r\nself-government to the Nation's Capital. I urge the Congress to move\r\npromptly in this direction and also to revise District revenue measures to\r\nprovide needed public works improvements.\r\n\r\nThe people of Hawaii are ready for statehood. I renew my request for this\r\nlegislation in order that Hawaii may elect its State officials and its\r\nrepresentatives in Washington along with the rest of the country this\r\nfall.\r\n\r\nFor years our citizens between the ages of 18 and 21 have, in time of\r\nperil, been summoned to fight for America. They should participate in the\r\npolitical process that produces this fateful summons. I urge Congress to\r\npropose to the States a constitutional amendment permitting citizens to\r\nvote when they reach the age of 18.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nI want to add one final word about the general purport of these many\r\nrecommendations.\r\n\r\nOur government's powers are wisely limited by the Constitution; but quite\r\napart from those limitations, there are things which no government can do\r\nor should try to do.\r\n\r\nA government can strive, as ours is striving, to maintain an economic\r\nsystem whose doors are open to enterprise and ambition--those personal\r\nqualities on which economic growth largely depends. But enterprise and\r\nambition are qualities which no government can supply. Fortunately no\r\nAmerican government need concern itself on this score; our people have\r\nthese qualities in good measure.\r\n\r\nA government can sincerely strive for peace, as ours is striving, and ask\r\nits people to make sacrifices for the sake of peace. But no government can\r\nplace peace in the hearts of foreign rulers. It is our duty then to\r\nourselves and to freedom itself to remain strong in all those\r\nways--spiritual, economic, military--that will give us maximum safety\r\nagainst the possibility of aggressive action by others.\r\n\r\nNo government can inoculate its people against the fatal materialism that\r\nplagues our age. Happily, our people, though blessed with more material\r\ngoods than any people in history, have always reserved their first\r\nallegiance to the kingdom of the spirit, which is the true source of that\r\nfreedom we value above all material things.\r\n\r\nBut a government can try, as ours tries, to sense the deepest aspirations\r\nof the people, and to express them in political action at home and abroad.\r\nSo long as action and aspiration humbly and earnestly seek favor in the\r\nsight of the Almighty, there is no end to America's forward road; there is\r\nno obstacle on it she will not surmount in her march toward a lasting peace\r\nin a free and prosperous world.\r\n\r\nThe Address as reported from the floor appears in the Congressional Record\r\n(vol. 100, p. 62).\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nDwight D. Eisenhower\r\nJanuary 6, 1955\r\n\r\nMr. President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the Congress:\r\n\r\nFirst, I extend cordial greetings to the 84th Congress. We shall have much\r\nto do together; I am sure that we shall get it done--and, that we shall do\r\nit in harmony and good will.\r\n\r\nAt the outset, I believe it would be well to remind ourselves of this great\r\nfundamental in our national life: our common belief that every human being\r\nis divinely endowed with dignity and worth and inalienable rights. This\r\nfaith, with its corollary--that to grow and flourish people must be\r\nfree--shapes the interests and aspirations of every American.\r\n\r\nFrom this deep faith have evolved three main purposes of our Federal\r\nGovernment:\r\n\r\nFirst, to maintain justice and freedom among ourselves and to champion them\r\nfor others so that we may work effectively for enduring peace;\r\n\r\nSecond, to help keep our economy vigorous and expanding, thus sustaining\r\nour international strength and assuring better jobs, better living, better\r\nopportunities for every citizen;\r\n\r\nAnd third, to concern ourselves with the human problems of our people so\r\nthat every American may have the opportunity to lead a healthy, productive\r\nand rewarding life.\r\n\r\nForemost among these broad purposes of government is our support of\r\nfreedom, justice and peace.\r\n\r\nIt is of the utmost importance, that each of us understand the true nature\r\nof the struggle now taking place in the world.\r\n\r\nIt is not a struggle merely of economic theories, or of forms of\r\ngovernment, or of military power. At issue is the true nature of man.\r\nEither man is the creature whom the Psalmist described as \"a little lower\r\nthan the angels,\" crowned with glory and honor, holding \"dominion over the\r\nworks\" of his Creator; or man is a soulless, animated machine to be\r\nenslaved, used and consumed by the state for its own glorification.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, a struggle which goes to the roots of the human spirit,\r\nand its shadow falls across the long sweep of man's destiny. This prize, so\r\nprecious, so fraught with ultimate meaning, is the true object of the\r\ncontending forces in the world.\r\n\r\nIn the past year, there has been progress justifying hope, both for\r\ncontinuing peace and for the ultimate rule of freedom and justice in the\r\nworld. Free nations are collectively stronger than at any time in recent\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nJust as nations of this Hemisphere, in the historic Caracas and Rio\r\nconferences, have closed ranks against imperialistic Communism and\r\nstrengthened their economic ties, so free nations elsewhere have forged new\r\nbonds of unity.\r\n\r\nRecent agreements between Turkey and Pakistan have laid a foundation for\r\nincreased strength in the Middle East. With our understanding support,\r\nEgypt and Britain, Yugoslavia and Italy, Britain and Iran have resolved\r\ndangerous differences. The security of the Mediterranean has been enhanced\r\nby an alliance among Greece, Turkey and Yugoslavia. Agreements in Western\r\nEurope have paved the way for unity to replace past divisions which have\r\nundermined Europe's economic and military vitality. The defense of the West\r\nappears likely at last to include a free, democratic Germany participating\r\nas an equal in the councils of NATO.\r\n\r\nIn Asia and the Pacific, the pending Manila Pact supplements our treaties\r\nwith Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Korea and Japan and our\r\nprospective treaty with the Republic of China. These pacts stand as solemn\r\nwarning that future military aggression and subversion against the free\r\nnations of Asia will meet united response. The Pacific Charter, also\r\nadopted at Manila, is a milestone in the development of human freedom and\r\nself-government in the Pacific area.\r\n\r\nUnder the auspices of the United Nations, there is promise of progress in\r\nour country's plan for the peaceful use of atomic energy.\r\n\r\nFinally, today the world is at peace. It is, to be sure, an secure peace.\r\nYet all humanity finds hope in the simple fact that for an appreciable time\r\nthere has been no active major battlefield on earth. This same fact\r\ninspires us to work all the more effectively with other nations for the\r\nwell-being, the freedom, the dignity, of every human on earth.\r\n\r\nThese developments are heartening indeed, and we are hopeful of continuing\r\nprogress. But sobering problems remain.\r\n\r\nThe massive military machines and ambitions of the Soviet-Communist bloc\r\nstill create uneasiness in the world. All of us are aware of the continuing\r\nreliance of the Soviet Communists on military force, of the power of their\r\nweapons, of their present resistance to realistic armament limitation, and\r\nof their continuing effort to dominate or intimidate free nations on their\r\nperiphery. Their steadily growing power includes an increasing strength in\r\nnuclear weapons. This power, combined with the proclaimed intentions of the\r\nCommunist leaders to communize the world, is the threat confronting us\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\nTo protect our nations and our peoples from the catastrophe of a nuclear\r\nholocaust, free nations must maintain countervailing military power to\r\npersuade the Communists of the futility of seeking their ends through\r\naggression. If Communist rulers understand that America's response to\r\naggression will be swift and decisive--that never shall we buy peace at the\r\nexpense of honor or faith--they will be powerfully deterred from launching\r\na military venture engulfing their own peoples and many others in disaster.\r\nThis, of course, is merely world stalemate. But in this stalemate each of\r\nus may and must exercise his high duty to strive in every honorable way for\r\nenduring peace.\r\n\r\nThe military threat is but one menace to our freedom and security. We must\r\nnot only deter aggression; we must also frustrate the effort of Communists\r\nto gain their goals by subversion. To this end, free nations must maintain\r\nand reinforce their cohesion, their internal security, their political and\r\neconomic vitality, and their faith in freedom.\r\n\r\nIn such a world, America's course is dear:\r\n\r\nWe must tirelessly labor to make the peace more just and durable.\r\n\r\nWe must strengthen the collective defense under the United Nations Charter\r\nand gird ourselves with sufficient military strength and productive\r\ncapacity to discourage resort to war and protect our nation's vital\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\nWe must continue to support and strengthen the United Nations. At this very\r\nmoment, by vote of the United Nations General Assembly, its\r\nSecretary-General is in Communist China on a mission of deepest concern to\r\nall Americans: seeking the release of our never-to-be-forgotten American\r\naviators and all other United Nations prisoners wrongfully detained by the\r\nCommunist regime.\r\n\r\nWe must also encourage the efforts being made in the United Nations to\r\nlimit armaments and to harness the atom to peaceful rise.\r\n\r\nWe must expand international trade and investment and assist friendly\r\nnations whose own best efforts are still insufficient to provide the\r\nstrength essential to the security of the free world.\r\n\r\nWe must be willing to use the processes of negotiation whenever they will\r\nadvance the cause of just and secure peace to which the United States and\r\nother free nations are dedicated.\r\n\r\nIn respect to all these matters, we must, through a vigorous information\r\nprogram, keep the peoples of the world truthfully advised of our actions\r\nand purposes. This problem has been attacked with new vigor during the past\r\nmonths. I urge that the Congress give its earnest consideration to the\r\ngreat advantages that can accrue to our country through the successful\r\noperations of this program.\r\n\r\nWe must also carry forward our educational exchange program. This sharing\r\nof knowledge and experience between our citizens and those of free\r\ncountries is a powerful factor in the development and maintenance of true\r\npartnership among free peoples.\r\n\r\nTo advance these many efforts, the Congress must act in this session on\r\nappropriations, legislation, and treaties. Today I shall mention especially\r\nour foreign economic and military programs.\r\n\r\nThe recent economic progress in many free nations has been most heartening.\r\nThe productivity of labor and the production of goods and services are\r\nincreasing in ever-widening areas. There is a growing will to improve the\r\nliving standards of all men. This progress is important to all our people.\r\nIt promises us allies who are strong and self-reliant; it promises a\r\ngrowing world market for the products of our mines, our factories, and our\r\nfarms.\r\n\r\nBut only through steady effort can we hope to continue this progress.\r\nBarriers still impede trade and the flow of capital needed to develop each\r\nnation's human and material resources. Wise reduction of these barriers is\r\na long-term objective of our foreign economic policy--a policy of an\r\nevolutionary and selective nature, assuring broad benefits to our own and\r\nother peoples.\r\n\r\nWe must gradually reduce certain tariff obstacles to trade. These actions\r\nshould, of course, be accompanied by a similar lowering of trade barriers\r\nby other nations, so that we may move steadily toward greater economic\r\nadvantage for all. We must further simplify customs administration and\r\nprocedures. We must facilitate the flow of capital and continue technical\r\nassistance, both directly and through the United Nations, to less developed\r\ncountries to strengthen their independence and raise their living\r\nstandards. Many another step must be taken in and among the nations of the\r\nfree world to release forces of private initiative. In our own nation,\r\nthese forces have brought strength and prosperity; once released, they will\r\ngenerate rising incomes in these other countries with which to buy the\r\nproducts of American industry, labor and agriculture.\r\n\r\nOn January 10, by special message, I shall submit specific recommendations\r\nfor carrying forward the legislative phases of our foreign economic\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nOur many efforts to build a better world include the maintenance of our\r\nmilitary strength. This is a vast undertaking. Major national security\r\nprograms consume two-thirds of the entire Federal budget. Over four million\r\nAmericans--servicemen and civilians--are on the rolls of the defense\r\nestablishment. During the past two years, by eliminating duplication and\r\noverstaffing, by improved procurement and inventory controls, and by\r\nconcentrating on the essentials, many billions of dollars have been saved\r\nin our defense activities. I should like to mention certain fundamentals\r\nunderlying this vast program.\r\n\r\nFirst, a realistic limitation of armaments and an enduring, just peace\r\nremain our national goals; we maintain powerful military forces because\r\nthere is no present alternative--forces designed for deterrent and\r\ndefensive purposes alone but able instantly to strike back with destructive\r\npower in response to an attack.\r\n\r\nSecond, we must stay alert to the fact that undue reliance on one weapon or\r\npreparation for only one kind of warfare simply invites an enemy to resort\r\nto another. We must, therefore, keep in our armed forces balance and\r\nflexibility adequate for our purposes and objectives.\r\n\r\nThird, to keep our armed forces abreast of the advances of science, our\r\nmilitary planning must be flexible enough to utilize the new weapons and\r\ntechniques which flow ever more speedily from our research and development\r\nprograms. The forthcoming military budget therefore emphasizes modern\r\nairpower in the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps and increases the emphasis\r\non new weapons, especially those of rapid and destructive striking power.\r\nIt assures the maintenance of effective, retaliatory force as the principal\r\ndeterrent to overt aggression. It accelerates the continental defense\r\nprogram and the build-up of ready military reserve forces. It continues a\r\nvigorous program of stockpiling strategic and critical materials and\r\nstrengthening our mobilization base. The budget also contemplates the\r\nstrategic concentration of our strength through redeployment of certain\r\nforces. It provides for reduction of forces in certain categories and their\r\nexpansion in others, to fit them to the military realities of our time.\r\nThese emphases in our defense planning have been made at my personal\r\ndirection after long and thoughtful study. In my judgment, they will give\r\nour nation a defense accurately adjusted to the national need.\r\n\r\nFourth, pending a world agreement on armament limitation, we must continue\r\nto improve and expand our supplies of nuclear weapons for our land, naval\r\nand air forces, while, at the same time, continuing our encouraging\r\nprogress in the peaceful use of atomic power.\r\n\r\nAnd fifth, in the administration of these costly programs, we must demand\r\nthe utmost in efficiency and ingenuity. We must assure our people not only\r\nof adequate protection but also of a defense that can be carried forward\r\nfrom year to year until the threat of aggression has disappeared.\r\n\r\nTo help maintain this kind of armed strength and improve its efficiency, I\r\nmust urge the enactment of several important measures in this session.\r\n\r\nThe first concerns the selective service act which expires next June 30th.\r\nFor the foreseeable future, our standing forces must remain much larger\r\nthan voluntary methods can sustain. We must, therefore, extend the\r\nstatutory authority to induct men for two years of military service.\r\n\r\nThe second kind of measure concerns the rapid turnover of our most\r\nexperienced servicemen. This process seriously weakens the combat readiness\r\nof our armed forces and is exorbitantly expensive. To encourage more\r\ntrained servicemen to remain in uniform, I shall, on the thirteenth of this\r\nmonth, propose a number of measures to increase the attractions of a\r\nmilitary career. These measures will include more adequate medical care for\r\ndependents, survivors' benefits, more and better housing, and selective\r\nadjustments in military pay and other allowances.\r\n\r\nAnd third--also on January 13--I shall present a program to rebuild and\r\nstrengthen the civilian components of our armed forces. This is a\r\ncomprehensive program, designed to make better use of our manpower of\r\nmilitary age. Because it will go far in assuring fair and equitable\r\nparticipation in military training and service, it is of particular\r\nimportance to our combat veterans. In keeping with the historic military\r\npolicy of our Republic, this program is designed to build and maintain\r\npowerful civilian reserves immediately capable of effective military\r\nservice in an emergency in lieu of maintaining active duty forces in excess\r\nof the nation's immediate need.\r\n\r\nMaintenance of an effective defense requires continuance of our aggressive\r\nattack on subversion at home. In this effort we have, in the past two\r\nyears, made excellent progress. FBI investigations have been powerfully\r\nreinforced by a new Internal Security Division in the Department of\r\nJustice; the security activities of the Immigration and Naturalization\r\nService have been revitalized; an improved and strengthened security system\r\nis in effect throughout the government; the Department of Justice and the\r\nFBI have been armed with effective new legal weapons forged by the 83rd\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nWe shall continue to ferret out and to destroy Communist subversion.\r\n\r\nWe shall, in the process, carefully preserve our traditions and the basic\r\nrights of our citizens.\r\n\r\nOur civil defense program is also a key element in the protection of our\r\ncountry. We are developing cooperative methods with State Governors,\r\nMayors, and voluntary citizen groups, as well as among Federal agencies, in\r\nbuilding the civil defense organization. Its significance in time of war is\r\nobvious; its swift assistance in disaster areas last year proved its\r\nimportance in time of peace.\r\n\r\nAn industry capable of rapid expansion and essential materials and\r\nfacilities swiftly available in time of emergency are indispensable to our\r\ndefense. I urge, therefore, a two-year extension of the Defense Production\r\nAct and Title II of the First War Powers Act of 1941. These are\r\ncornerstones of our program for the development and maintenance of an\r\nadequate mobilization base. At this point, I should like to make this\r\nadditional observation. Our quest for peace and freedom necessarily\r\npresumes that we who hold positions of public trust must rise above self\r\nand section--that we must subordinate to the general good our partisan, our\r\npersonal pride and prejudice. Tirelessly, with united purpose, we must\r\nfortify the material and spiritual foundations of this land of freedom and\r\nof free nations throughout the world. As never before, there is need for\r\nunhesitating cooperation among the branches of our government.\r\n\r\nAt this time the executive and legislative branches are under the\r\nmanagement of different political parties. This fact places both parties on\r\ntrial before the American people.\r\n\r\nIn less perilous days of the past, division of governmental responsibility\r\namong our great parties has produced a paralyzing indecision. We must not\r\nlet this happen in our time. We must avoid a paralysis of the will for\r\npeace and international security.\r\n\r\nIn the traditionally bipartisan areas--military security and foreign\r\nrelations--I can report to you that I have already, with the leaders of\r\nthis Congress, expressed assurances of unreserved cooperation. Yet, the\r\nstrength of our country requires more than mere maintenance of military\r\nstrength and success in foreign affairs; these vital matters are in turn\r\ndependent upon concerted and vigorous action in a number of supporting\r\nprograms. I say, therefore, to the 84th Congress:\r\n\r\nIn all areas basic to the strength of America, there will be--to the extent\r\nI can insure them--cooperative, constructive relations between the\r\nExecutive and Legislative Branches of this government. Let the general good\r\nbe our yardstick on every great issue of our time.\r\n\r\nOur efforts to defend our freedom and to secure a just peace are, of\r\ncourse, inseparable from the second great purpose of our government: to\r\nhelp maintain a strong, growing economy--an economy vigorous and free, in\r\nwhich there are ever-increasing opportunities, just rewards for effort, and\r\na stable prosperity that is widely shared.\r\n\r\nIn the past two years, many important governmental Actions helped our\r\neconomy adjust to conditions of peace; these and other actions created a\r\nclimate for renewed economic growth. Controls were removed from wages,\r\nprices and materials. Tax revisions encouraged increased private spending\r\nand employment. Federal expenditures were sharply reduced, making possible\r\na record tax cut. These actions, together with flexible monetary and debt\r\nmanagement policies, helped to halt inflation and stabilize the value of\r\nthe dollar. A program of cooperation and partnership in resource\r\ndevelopment was begun. Social security and unemployment insurance laws were\r\nbroadened and strengthened. New laws started the long process of balancing\r\nfarm production with farm markets. Expanded shipbuilding and stockpiling\r\nprograms strengthened key sectors of the economy, while improving our\r\nmobilization base. A comprehensive new housing law brought impressive\r\nprogress in an area fundamental to our economic strength and closed\r\nloopholes in the old laws permitting dishonest manipulation. Many of these\r\nprograms are just beginning to exert their main stimulating effect upon the\r\neconomy generally and upon specific communities and industries throughout\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nThe past year--1954--was one of the most prosperous years in our history.\r\nBusiness activity now surges with new strength. Production is rising.\r\nEmployment is high. Toward the end of last year average weekly wages in\r\nmanufacturing were higher than ever before. Personal income after taxes is\r\nat a record level. So is consumer spending. Construction activity is\r\nreaching new peaks. Export demand for our goods is strong. State and local\r\ngovernment expenditures on public works are rising. Savings are high, and\r\ncredit is readily available.\r\n\r\nSo, today, the transition to a peacetime economy is largely behind us.\r\n\r\nThe economic outlook is good.\r\n\r\nThe many promising factors I have mentioned do not guarantee sustained\r\neconomic expansion; however, they do give us a strong position from which\r\nto carry forward our economic growth. If we as a people act wisely, within\r\nten years our annual national output can rise from its present level of\r\nabout $360 billion to $500 billion, measured in dollars of stable buying\r\npower.\r\n\r\nMy Budget Message on January 17, the Economic Report on the 20th of this\r\nmonth, and several special messages will set forth in detail major programs\r\nto foster the growth of our economy and to protect the integrity of the\r\npeople's money. Today I shall discuss these programs only in general\r\nterms.\r\n\r\nGovernment efficiency and economy remain essential to steady progress\r\ntoward a balanced budget. More than ten billion dollars were cut from the\r\nspending program proposed in the budget of January 9, 1953. Expenditures of\r\nthat year were six and a half billion below those of the previous year. In\r\nthe current fiscal year, government spending will be nearly four and a half\r\nbillion dollars less than in the fiscal year which ended last June 30. New\r\nspending authority has been held below expenditures, reducing government\r\nobligations accumulated over the years.\r\n\r\nLast year we had a large tax cut and, for the first time in seventy-five\r\nyears a basic revision of Federal tax laws. It is now clear that defense\r\nand other essential government costs must remain at a level precluding\r\nfurther tax reductions this year. Although excise and corporation income\r\ntaxes must, therefore, be continued at their present rates, further tax\r\ncuts will be possible when justified by lower expenditures and by revenue\r\nincreases arising from the nation's economic growth. I am hopeful that such\r\nreductions can be made next year.\r\n\r\nAt the foundation of our economic growth are the raw materials and energy\r\nproduced from our minerals and fuels, lands and forests, and water\r\nresources. With respect to them, I believe that the nation must adhere to\r\nthree fundamental policies: first, to develop, wisely use and conserve\r\nbasic resources from generation to generation; second, to follow the\r\nhistoric pattern of developing these resources primarily by private\r\ncitizens under fair provisions of law, including restraints for proper\r\nconservation; and third, to treat resource development as a partnership\r\nundertaking--a partnership in which the participation of private citizens\r\nand State and local governments is as necessary as Federal participation.\r\n\r\nThis policy of partnership and cooperation is producing good results, most\r\nimmediately noticeable in respect to water resources. First, it has\r\nencouraged local public bodies and private citizens to plan their own power\r\nsources. Increasing numbers of applications to the Federal Power Commission\r\nto conduct surveys and prepare plans for power development, notably in the\r\nColumbia River Basin, are evidence of local response.\r\n\r\nSecond, the Federal Government and local and private organizations have\r\nbeen encouraged to coordinate their developments. This is important because\r\nFederal hydroelectric developments supply but a small fraction of the\r\nnation's power needs. Such partnership projects as Priest Rapids in\r\nWashington, the Coosa River development in Alabama, and Markham Ferry in\r\nOklahoma already have the approval of the Congress. This year justifiable\r\nprojects of a similar nature will again have Administration support.\r\n\r\nThird, the Federal Government must shoulder its own partnership obligations\r\nby undertaking projects of such complexity and size that their success\r\nrequires Federal development. In keeping with this principle, I again urge\r\nthe Congress to approve the development of the Upper Colorado River Basin\r\nto conserve and assure better use of precious water essential to the future\r\nof the West.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the 1956 budget will recommend appropriations to start six new\r\nreclamation and more than thirty new Corps of Engineers projects of varying\r\nsize. Going projects and investigations of potential new resource\r\ndevelopments will be continued.\r\n\r\nAlthough this partnership approach is producing encouraging results, its\r\nfull success requires a nation-wide comprehensive water resources policy\r\nfirmly based in law. Such a policy is under preparation and when completed\r\nwill be submitted to the Congress.\r\n\r\nIn the interest of their proper conservation, development and use,\r\ncontinued vigilance will be maintained over our fisheries, wildlife\r\nresources, the national parks and forests, and the public lands; and we\r\nshall continue to encourage an orderly development of the nation's mineral\r\nresources.\r\n\r\nA modern, efficient highway system is essential to meet the needs of our\r\ngrowing population, our expanding economy, and our national security. We\r\nare accelerating our highway improvement program as rapidly as possible\r\nunder existing State and Federal laws and authorizations. However, this\r\neffort will not in itself assure our people of an adequate highway system.\r\nOn my recommendation, this problem has been carefully considered by the\r\nConference of State Governors and by a special Advisory Committee on a\r\nNational Highway Program, composed of leading private citizens. I have\r\nreceived the recommendations of the Governors' Conference and will shortly\r\nreceive the views of the special Advisory Committee. Aided by their\r\nfindings, I shall submit on January 27th detailed recommendations which\r\nwill meet our most pressing national highway needs.\r\n\r\nIn further recognition of the importance of transportation to our economic\r\nstrength and security, the Administration, through a Cabinet committee, is\r\nthoroughly examining existing Federal transportation policies to determine\r\ntheir effect on the adequacy of transportation services. This is the first\r\nsuch comprehensive review directly undertaken by the Executive Branch of\r\nthe government in modern times. We are not only examining major problems\r\nfacing the various modes of transport; we are also studying closely the\r\ninter-relationships of civilian and government requirements for\r\ntransportation. Legislation will be recommended to correct policy\r\ndeficiencies which we may find.\r\n\r\nThe nation's public works activities are tremendous in scope. It is\r\nexpected that more than $ 12 billion will be expended in 1955 for the\r\ndevelopment of land, water and other resources; control of floods, and\r\nnavigation and harbor improvements; construction of roads, schools, and\r\nmunicipal water supplies, and disposal of domestic and industrial wastes.\r\nMany of the Federal, State and local agencies responsible for this work\r\nare, in their separate capacities, highly efficient. But public works\r\nactivities are closely inter-related and have a substantial influence on\r\nthe growth of the country. Moreover, in times of threatening economic\r\ncontraction, they may become a valuable sustaining force. To these ends,\r\nefficient planning and execution of the nation's public works require both\r\nthe coordination of Federal activities and effective cooperation with State\r\nand local governments.\r\n\r\nThe Council of Economic Advisers, through its public works planning\r\nsection, has made important advances during the past year in effecting this\r\ncoordination and cooperation. In view of the success of these initial\r\nefforts, and to give more emphasis and continuity to this essential\r\ncoordination, I shall request the Congress to appropriate funds for the\r\nsupport of an Office of Coordinator of Public Works in the Executive Office\r\nof the President.\r\n\r\nA most significant element in our growing economy is an agriculture that is\r\nstable, prosperous and free. The problems of our agriculture have evolved\r\nover many years and cannot be solved overnight; nevertheless, governmental\r\nactions last year hold great promise of fostering a better balance between\r\nproduction and markets and, consequently, a better and more stable income\r\nfor our farmers.\r\n\r\nThrough vigorous administration and through new authority provided by the\r\n83rd Congress, surplus farm products are now moving into consumption. From\r\nFebruary 1953 through November 1954, the rate of increase of\r\ngovernment-held surpluses has been reduced by our moving into use more than\r\n2.3 billion dollars' worth of government-owned farm commodities; this\r\namount is equal to more than seven percent of a year's production of all\r\nour farms and ranches. Domestic consumption remains high, and farm exports\r\nwill be higher than last year. As a result of the flexibility provided by\r\nthe Agricultural Act of 1954, we can move toward less restrictive acreage\r\ncontrols.\r\n\r\nThus, farm production is gradually adjusting to markets, markets are being\r\nexpanded, and stocks are moving into use. We can now look forward to an\r\neasing of the influences depressing farm prices, to reduced government\r\nexpenditures for purchase of surplus products, and to less Federal\r\nintrusion into the lives and plans of our farm people. Agricultural\r\nprograms have been redirected toward better balance, greater stability and\r\nsustained prosperity. We are headed in the right direction. I urgently\r\nrecommend to the Congress that we continue resolutely on this road.\r\n\r\nGreater attention must be directed to the needs of low-income farm\r\nfamilies. Twenty-eight per cent of our farm-operator families have net cash\r\nincomes of less than $1,000 per year. Last year, at my request, careful\r\nstudies were made of the problems of these farm people. I shall later\r\nsubmit recommendations designed to assure the steady alleviation of their\r\nmost pressing concerns.\r\n\r\nBecause drought also remains a serious agricultural problem, I shall\r\nrecommend legislation to strengthen Federal disaster assistance programs.\r\nThis legislation will prescribe an improved appraisal of need, better\r\nadjustment of the various programs to local conditions, and a more\r\nequitable sharing of costs between the States and the Federal Government.\r\n\r\nThe prosperity of our small business enterprises is an indispensable\r\nelement in the maintenance of our economic strength. Creation of the Small\r\nBusiness Administration and recently enacted tax laws facilitating small\r\nbusiness expansion are but two of many important steps we have taken to\r\nencourage our smaller enterprises. I recommend that the Congress extend the\r\nSmall Business Act of 1953 which is due to expire next June.\r\n\r\nWe come now to the third great purpose of our government-its concern for\r\nthe health, productivity and well-being of all our people.\r\n\r\nEvery citizen wants to give full expression to his God-given talents and\r\nabilities and to have the recognition and respect accorded under our\r\nreligious and political traditions. Americans also want a good material\r\nstandard of living--not simply to accumulate possessions, but to fulfill a\r\nlegitimate aspiration for an environment in which their families may live\r\nmeaningful and happy lives. Our people are committed, therefore, to the\r\ncreation and preservation of opportunity for every citizen to lead a more\r\nrewarding life. They are equally committed to the alleviation of misfortune\r\nand distress among their fellow citizens.\r\n\r\nThe aspirations of most of our people can best be fulfilled through their\r\nown enterprise and initiative, without government interference. This\r\nAdministration, therefore, follows two simple rules: first, the Federal\r\nGovernment should perform an essential task only when it cannot otherwise\r\nbe adequately performed; and second, in performing that task, our\r\ngovernment must not impair the self-respect, freedom and incentive of the\r\nindividual. So long as these two rules are observed, the government can\r\nfully meet its obligation without creating a dependent population or a\r\ndomineering bureaucracy.\r\n\r\nDuring the past two years, notable advances were made in these functions of\r\ngovernment. Protection of old-age and survivors' insurance was extended to\r\nan additional ten million of our people, and the benefits were\r\nsubstantially increased. Legislation was enacted to provide unemployment\r\ninsurance protection to some four million additional Americans.\r\nStabilization of living costs and the halting of inflation protected the\r\nvalue of pensions and savings. A broad program now helps to bring good\r\nhomes within the reach of the great majority of our people. With the\r\nStates, we are providing rehabilitation facilities and more clinics,\r\nhospitals, and nursing homes for patients with chronic illnesses. Also with\r\nthe States, we have begun a great and fruitful expansion in the restoration\r\nof disabled persons to employment and useful lives. In the areas of Federal\r\nresponsibility, we have made historic progress in eliminating from among\r\nour people demeaning practices based on race or color.\r\n\r\nAll of us may be proud of these achievements during the past two years. Yet\r\nessential Federal tasks remain to be done.\r\n\r\nAs part of our efforts to provide decent, safe and sanitary housing for\r\nlow-income families, we must carry forward the housing program authorized\r\nduring the 83rd Congress. We must also authorize contracts for a firm\r\nprogram of 35,000 additional public housing units in each of the next two\r\nfiscal years. This program will meet the most pressing obligations of the\r\nFederal Government into the 1958 fiscal year for planning and building\r\npublic housing. By that time the private building industry, aided by the\r\nHousing Act of 1954, will have had the opportunity to assume its full role\r\nin providing adequate housing for our low income families.\r\n\r\nThe health of our people is one of our most precious assets. Preventable\r\nsickness should be prevented; knowledge available to combat disease and\r\ndisability should be fully used. Otherwise, we as a people are guilty not\r\nonly of neglect of human suffering but also of wasting our national\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nConstant advances in medical care are not available to enough of our\r\ncitizens. Clearly our nation must do more to reduce the impact of accident\r\nand disease. Two fundamental problems confront us: first, high and\r\never-rising costs of health services; second, serious gaps and shortages in\r\nthese services.\r\n\r\nBy special message on January 24, I shall propose a coordinated program to\r\nstrengthen and improve existing health services. This program will continue\r\nto reject socialized medicine. It will emphasize individual and local\r\nresponsibility. Under it the Federal Government will neither dominate nor\r\ndirect, but serve as a helpful partner. Within this framework, the program\r\ncan be broad in scope.\r\n\r\nMy recommendations will include a Federal health reinsurance service to\r\nencourage the development of more and better voluntary health insurance\r\ncoverage by private organizations. I shall also recommend measures to\r\nimprove the medical care of that group of our citizens who, because of\r\nneed, receive Federal-State public assistance. These two proposals will\r\nhelp more of our people to meet the costs of health services.\r\n\r\nTo reduce the gaps in these services, I shall propose:\r\n\r\nNew measures to facilitate construction of needed health facilities and\r\nhelp reduce shortages of trained health personnel;\r\n\r\nVigorous steps to combat the misery and national loss involved in mental\r\nillness;\r\n\r\nImproved services for crippled children and for maternal and child health;\r\n\r\nBetter consumer protection under our existing pure food and drug laws; and,\r\nfinally,\r\n\r\nStrengthened programs to combat the increasingly serious pollution of our\r\nrivers and streams and the growing problem of air pollution.\r\n\r\nThese measures together constitute a comprehensive program holding rich\r\npromise for better health for all of our people.\r\n\r\nLast year's expansion of social security coverage and our new program of\r\nimproved medical care for public assistance recipients together suggest\r\nmodification of the formula for Federal sharing in old age assistance\r\npayments. I recommend modification of the formula where such payments will,\r\nin the future, supplement benefits received under the old age and survivors\r\ninsurance system.\r\n\r\nIt is the inalienable right of every person, from childhood on, to have\r\naccess to knowledge. In our form of society, this right of the individual\r\ntakes on a special meaning, for the education of all our citizens is\r\nimperative to the maintenance and invigoration of America's free\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nToday, we face grave educational problems. Effective and up-to-date\r\nanalyses of these problems and their solutions are being carried forward\r\nthrough the individual State conferences and the White House Conference to\r\nbe completed this year.\r\n\r\nHowever, such factors as population growth, additional responsibilities of\r\nschools, and increased and longer school attendance have produced an\r\nunprecedented classroom shortage. This shortage is of immediate concern to\r\nall of our people. Positive, affirmative action must be taken now.\r\n\r\nWithout impairing in any way the responsibilities of our States,\r\nlocalities, communities, or families, the Federal government can and should\r\nserve as an effective-catalyst in dealing with this problem. I shall\r\nforward a special message to the Congress on February 15, presenting an\r\naffirmative program dealing with this shortage.\r\n\r\nTo help the States do a better and more timely job, we must strengthen\r\ntheir resources for preventing and dealing with juvenile delinquency. I\r\nshall propose Federal legislation to assist the States to promote concerted\r\naction in dealing with this nationwide problem. I shall carry forward the\r\nvigorous efforts of the Administration to improve the international control\r\nof the traffic in narcotics and, in cooperation with State and local\r\nagencies, to combat narcotic addiction in our country.\r\n\r\nI should like to speak now of additional matters of importance to all our\r\npeople and especially to our wage earners.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year certain industrial changes and the readjustment of the\r\neconomy to conditions of peace brought unemployment and other difficulties\r\nto various localities and industries. These problems are engaging our most\r\nearnest attention. But for the overwhelming majority of our working people,\r\nthe past year has meant good jobs. Moreover, the earnings and savings of\r\nour wage earners are no longer depreciating in value. Because of\r\ncooperative relations between labor and management, fewer working days were\r\nlost through strikes in 1954 than in any year in the past decade.\r\n\r\nThe outlook for our wage earners can be made still more promising by\r\nseveral legislative actions.\r\n\r\nFirst, in the past five years we have had economic growth which will\r\nsupport an increase in the Federal minimum wage. In the light of present\r\neconomic conditions, I recommend its increase to ninety cents an hour. I\r\nalso recommend that many others, at present excluded, be given the\r\nprotection of a minimum wage.\r\n\r\nSecond, I renew my recommendation of last year for amendment of the Labor\r\nManagement Relations Act of 1947 to further the basic objectives of this\r\nstatute. I especially call to the attention of the Congress amendments\r\ndealing with the right of economic strikers to vote in representation\r\nelections and the need for equalizing the obligation under the Act to file\r\ndisclaimers of Communist affiliation.\r\n\r\nThird, the Administration will propose other important measures including\r\noccupational safety, workmen's compensation for longshoremen and harbor\r\nworkers, and the \"Eight Hour Laws\" applicable to Federal contractors.\r\nLegislation will also be proposed respecting nonoccupational disability\r\ninsurance and unemployment compensation in the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\nIn considering human needs, the Federal Government must take special\r\nresponsibility for citizens in its direct employ. On January 11 I shall\r\npropose a pay adjustment plan for civilian employees outside the Postal\r\nField Service to correct inequities and increase individual pay rates. I\r\nshall also recommend voluntary health insurance on a contributory basis for\r\nFederal employees and their dependents. In keeping with the Group Life\r\nInsurance Act passed in the 83rd Congress, this protection should be\r\nprovided on the group insurance principle and purchased from private\r\nfacilities. Also on January 11 I shall recommend a modern pay plan,\r\nincluding pay increases, for postal field employees. As part of this\r\nprogram, and to carry forward our progress toward elimination of the large\r\nannual postal deficit. I shall renew my request for an increase in postal\r\nrates. Again I urge that in the future the fixing of rates be delegated to\r\nan impartial, independent body.\r\n\r\nMore adequate training programs to equip career employees of the government\r\nto render improved public service will be recommended, as will improvements\r\nin the laws affecting employees serving on foreign assignments.\r\n\r\nNeeded improvements in survivor, disability, and retirement benefits for\r\nFederal civilian and military personnel have been extensively considered by\r\nthe Committee on Retirement Policy for Federal personnel. The Committee's\r\nproposals would strengthen and improve benefits for our career people in\r\ngovernment, and I endorse their broad objectives. Full contributory\r\ncoverage under old-age and survivors' insurance should be made available to\r\nall Federal personnel, just as in private industry. For career military\r\npersonnel, the protection of the old-age and survivors' insurance system\r\nwould be an important and long-needed addition, especially to their present\r\nunequal and inadequate survivorship protection. The military retirement pay\r\nsystem should remain separate and unchanged. Certain adjustments in the\r\npresent civilian personnel retirement systems will be needed to reflect the\r\nadditional protection of old-age and survivors' insurance. However, these\r\nsystems also are a basic part of a total compensation and should be\r\nseparately and independently retained.\r\n\r\nI also urge the Congress to approve a long overdue increase in the salaries\r\nof Members of the Congress and of the Federal judiciary to a level\r\ncommensurate with their heavy responsibilities.\r\n\r\nOur concern for the individual in our country requires that we consider\r\nseveral additional problems.\r\n\r\nWe must continue our program to help our Indian citizens improve their lot\r\nand make their full contribution to national life. Two years ago I advised\r\nthe Congress of injustices under existing immigration laws. Through humane\r\nadministration, the Department of Justice is doing what it legally can to\r\nalleviate hardships. Clearance of aliens before arrival has been initiated,\r\nand except for criminal offenders, the imprisonment of aliens awaiting\r\nadmission or deportation has been stopped. Certain provisions of law,\r\nhowever, have the effect of compelling action in respect to aliens which\r\nare inequitable in some instances and discriminatory in others. These\r\nprovisions should be corrected in this session of the Congress.\r\n\r\nAs the complex problems of Alaska are resolved, that Territory should\r\nexpect to achieve statehood. In the meantime, there is no justification for\r\ndeferring the admission to statehood of Hawaii. I again urge approval of\r\nthis measure.\r\n\r\nWe have three splendid opportunities to demonstrate the strength of our\r\nbelief in the right of suffrage. First, I again urge that a Constitutional\r\namendment be submitted to the States to reduce the voting age for Federal\r\nelections. Second, I renew my request that the principle of self-government\r\nbe extended and the right of suffrage granted to the citizens of the\r\nDistrict of Columbia. Third, I again recommend that we work with the States\r\nto preserve the voting fights of citizens in the nation's service\r\noverseas.\r\n\r\nIn our determination to keep faith with those who in the past have met the\r\nhighest call of citizenship, we now have under study the system of benefits\r\nfor veterans and for surviving dependents of deceased veterans and\r\nservicemen. Studies will be undertaken to determine the need for measures\r\nto ease the readjustment to civilian life of men required to enter the\r\narmed forces for two years of service.\r\n\r\nIn the advancement of the various activities which will make our\r\ncivilization endure and flourish, the Federal Government should do more to\r\ngive official recognition to the importance of the arts and other cultural\r\nactivities. I shall recommend the establishment of a Federal Advisory\r\nCommission on the Arts within the Department of Health, Education and\r\nWelfare, to advise the Federal Government on ways to encourage artistic\r\nendeavor and appreciation. I shall also propose that awards of merit be\r\nestablished whereby we can honor our fellow citizens who make great\r\ncontribution to the advancement of our civilization.\r\n\r\nEvery citizen rightly expects efficient and economical administration of\r\nthese many government programs I have outlined today. I strongly recommend\r\nextension of the Reorganization Act and the law establishing the Commission\r\non Intergovernmental Relations, both of which expire this spring. Thus the\r\nCongress will assure continuation of the excellent progress recently made\r\nin improving government organization and administration. In this connection\r\nwe are looking forward with great interest to the reports which will soon\r\nbe going to the Congress from the Commission on Organization of the\r\nExecutive Branch of the Government. I am sure that these studies, made\r\nunder the chairmanship of former President Herbert Hoover with the\r\nassistance of more than two hundred distinguished citizens, will be of\r\ngreat value in paving the way toward more efficiency and economy in the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nAnd now, I return to the point at which I began--the faith of our people.\r\n\r\nThe many programs here summarized are, I believe, in full keeping with\r\ntheir needs, interests and aspirations. The obligations upon us are clear:\r\n\r\nTo labor earnestly, patiently, prayerfully, for peace, for freedom, for\r\njustice, throughout the world;\r\n\r\nTo keep our economy vigorous and free, that our people may lead fuller,\r\nhappier lives;\r\n\r\nTo advance, not merely by our words but by our acts, the determination of\r\nour government that every citizen shall have opportunity to develop to his\r\nfullest capacity.\r\n\r\nAs we do these things, before us is a future filled with opportunity and\r\nhope. That future will be ours if in our time we keep alive the patience,\r\nthe courage, the confidence in tomorrow, the deep faith, of the millions\r\nwho, in years past, made and preserved us this nation.\r\n\r\nA decade ago, in the death and desolation of European battlefields, I saw\r\nthe courage and resolution, I felt the inspiration, of American youth. In\r\nthese young men I felt America's buoyant confidence and irresistible\r\nwill-to-do. In them I saw, too, a devout America, humble before God.\r\n\r\nAnd so, I know with all my heart--and I deeply believe that all Americans\r\nknow--that, despite the anxieties of this divided world, our faith, and the\r\ncause in which we all believe, will surely prevail.\r\n\r\nThe address as reported from the floor appears in the Congressional Record\r\n(vol. 101, p. 94).\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nDwight D. Eisenhower\r\nJanuary 5, 1956\r\n\r\nTo the Congress of the United States:\r\n\r\nThe opening of this new year must arouse in us all grateful thanks to a\r\nkind Providence whose protection has been ever present and whose bounty has\r\nbeen manifold and abundant. The State of the Union today demonstrates what\r\ncan be accomplished under God by a free people; by their vision, their\r\nunderstanding of national problems, their initiative, their self-reliance,\r\ntheir capacity for work--and by their willingness to sacrifice whenever\r\nsacrifice is needed.\r\n\r\nIn the past three years, responding to what our people want their\r\nGovernment to do, the Congress and the Executive have done much in building\r\na stronger, better America. There has been broad progress in fostering the\r\nenergies of our people, in providing greater opportunity for the\r\nsatisfaction of their needs, and in fulfilling their demands for the\r\nstrength and security of the Republic.\r\n\r\nOur country is at peace. Our security posture commands respect. A spiritual\r\nvigor marks our national life. Our economy, approaching the 400 billion\r\ndollar mark, is at an unparalleled level of prosperity. The national income\r\nis more widely and fairly distributed than ever before. The number of\r\nAmericans at work has reached an all-time high. As a people, we are\r\nachieving ever higher standards of living--earning more, producing more,\r\nconsuming more, building more and investing more than ever before.\r\n\r\nVirtually all sectors of our society are sharing in these good times. Our\r\nfarm families, if we act wisely, imaginatively and promptly to strengthen\r\nour present farm programs, can also look forward to sharing equitably in\r\nthe prosperity they have helped to create.\r\n\r\nWar in Korea ended two and a half years ago. The collective security system\r\nhas been powerfully strengthened. Our defenses have been reinforced at\r\nsharply reduced costs. Programs to expand world trade and to harness the\r\natom for the betterment of mankind have been carried forward. Our economy\r\nhas been freed from governmental wage and price controls. Inflation has\r\nbeen halted; the cost of living stabilized.\r\n\r\nGovernment spending has been cut by more than ten billion dollars. Nearly\r\nthree hundred thousand positions have been eliminated from the Federal\r\npayroll. Taxes have been substantially reduced. A balanced budget is in\r\nprospect. Social security has been extended to ten million more Americans\r\nand unemployment insurance to four million more. Unprecedented advances in\r\ncivil rights have been made. The long-standing and deep-seated problems of\r\nagriculture have been forthrightly attacked.\r\n\r\nThis record of progress has been accomplished with a self imposed caution\r\nagainst unnecessary and unwise interference in the private affairs of our\r\npeople, of their communities and of the several States.\r\n\r\nIf we of the Executive and Legislative Branches, keeping this caution ever\r\nin mind, address ourselves to the business of the year before us--and to\r\nthe unfinished business of last year--with resolution, the outlook is\r\nbright with promise.\r\n\r\nMany measures of great national importance recommended last year to the\r\nCongress still demand immediate attention legislation for school and\r\nhighway construction; health and immigration legislation; water resources\r\nlegislation; legislation to complete the implementation of our foreign\r\neconomic policy; such labor legislation as amendments of the\r\nLabor-Management Relations Act, extension of the Fair Labor Standards Act\r\nto additional groups not now covered, and occupational safety legislation;\r\nand legislation for construction of an atomic-powered exhibit vessel.\r\n\r\nMany new items of business likewise require our attention-measures that\r\nwill further promote the release of the energies of our people; that will\r\nbroaden opportunity for all of them; that will advance the Republic in its\r\nleadership toward a just peace; measures, in short, that are essential to\r\nthe building of an everstronger, ever-better America.\r\n\r\nEvery political and economic guide supports a valid confidence that wise\r\neffort will be rewarded by an even more plentiful harvest of human benefit\r\nthan we now enjoy. Our resources are too many, our principles too dynamic,\r\nour purposes too worthy and the issues at stake too immense for us to\r\nentertain doubt or fear. But our responsibilities require that we approach\r\nthis year's business with a sober humility.\r\n\r\nA heedless pride in our present strength and position would blind us to the\r\nfacts of the past, to the pitfalls of the future. We must walk ever in the\r\nknowledge that we are enriched by a heritage earned in the labor and\r\nsacrifice of our forebears; that, for our children's children, we are\r\ntrustees of a great Republic and a time-tested political system; that we\r\nprosper as a cooperating member of the family of nations.\r\n\r\nIn this light the Administration has continued work on its program for the\r\nRepublic, begun three years ago. Because the vast spread of national and\r\nhuman interests is involved within it, I shall not in this Message attempt\r\nits detailed delineation. Instead, from time to time during this Session,\r\nthere will be submitted to the Congress specific recommendations within\r\nspecific fields. In the comprehensive survey required for their\r\npreparation, the Administration is guided by enduring objectives. The first\r\nis:\r\n\r\nTHE DISCHARGE OF OUR WORLD RESPONSIBILITY\r\n\r\nOur world policy and our actions are dedicated to the achievement of peace\r\nwith justice for all nations.\r\n\r\nWith this purpose, we move in a wide variety of ways and through many\r\nagencies to remove the pall of fear; to strengthen the ties with our\r\npartners and to improve the cooperative cohesion of the free world; to\r\nreduce the burden of armaments, and to stimulate and inspire action among\r\nall nations for a world of justice and prosperity and peace. These national\r\nobjectives are fully supported by both our political parties.\r\n\r\nIn the past year, our search for a more stable and just peace has taken\r\nvaried forms. Among the most important were the two Conferences at Geneva,\r\nin July and in the fall of last year. We explored the possibilities of\r\nagreement on critical issues that jeopardize the peace.\r\n\r\nThe July meeting of Heads of Government held out promise to the world of\r\nmoderation in the bitterness, of word and action, which tends to generate\r\nconflict and war. All were in agreement that a nuclear war would be an\r\nintolerable disaster which must not be permitted to occur. But in October,\r\nwhen the Foreign Ministers met again, the results demonstrated conclusively\r\nthat the Soviet leaders are not yet willing to create the indispensable\r\nconditions for a secure and lasting peace.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it is clear that the conflict between international communism\r\nand freedom has taken on a new complexion.\r\n\r\nWe know the Communist leaders have often practiced the tactics of retreat\r\nand zigzag. We know that Soviet and Chinese communism still poses a serious\r\nthreat to the free world. And in the Middle East recent Soviet moves are\r\nhardly compatible with the reduction of international tension.\r\n\r\nYet Communist tactics against the free nations have shifted in emphasis\r\nfrom reliance on violence and the threat of violence to reliance on\r\ndivision, enticement and duplicity. We must be well prepared to meet the\r\ncurrent tactics which pose a dangerous though less obvious threat. At the\r\nsame time, our policy must be dynamic as well as flexible, designed\r\nprimarily to forward the achievement of our own objectives rather than to\r\nmeet each shift and change on the Communist front. We must act in the firm\r\nassurance that the fruits of freedom are more attractive and desirable to\r\nmankind in the pursuit of happiness than the record of Communism.\r\n\r\nIn the face of Communist military power, we must, of course, continue to\r\nmaintain an effective system of collective security. This involves two\r\nthings--a system which gives clear warning that armed aggression will be\r\nmet by joint action of the free nations, and deterrent military power to\r\nmake that warning effective. Moreover, the awesome power of the atom must\r\nbe made to serve as a guardian of the free community and of the peace.\r\n\r\nIn the last year, the free world has seen major gains for the system of\r\ncollective security: the accession to the North Atlantic Treaty\r\nOrganization and Western European Union of the sovereign Federal German\r\nRepublic; the developing cooperation under the Southeast Asia Collective\r\nDefense Treaty; and the formation in the Middle East of the Baghdad Pact\r\namong Turkey, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan and the United Kingdom. In our own\r\nhemisphere, the inter-American system has continued to show its vitality in\r\nmaintaining peace and a common approach to world problems. We now have\r\nsecurity pacts with more than 40 other nations.\r\n\r\nIn the pursuit of our national purposes, we have been steadfast in our\r\nsupport of the United Nations, now entering its second decade with a wider\r\nmembership and ever-increasing influence and usefulness. In the release of\r\nour fifteen fliers from Communist China, an essential prelude was the world\r\nopinion mobilized by the General Assembly, which condemned their\r\nimprisonment and demanded their liberation. The successful Atomic Energy\r\nConference held in Geneva under United Nations auspices and our Atoms for\r\nPeace program have been practical steps toward the world-wide use of this\r\nnew energy source. Our sponsorship of such use has benefited our relations\r\nwith other countries. Active negotiations are now in progress to create an\r\nInternational Agency to foster peaceful uses of atomic energy.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year the crucial problem of disarmament has moved to the\r\nforefront of practical political endeavor. At Geneva, I declared the\r\nreadiness of the United States to exchange blueprints of the military\r\nestablishments of our nation and the USSR, to be confirmed by reciprocal\r\naerial reconnaissance. By this means, I felt mutual suspicions could be\r\nallayed and an atmosphere developed in which negotiations looking toward\r\nlimitation of arms would have improved chances of success.\r\n\r\nIn the United Nations Subcommittee on Disarmament last fall, this proposal\r\nwas explored and the United States also declared itself willing to include\r\nreciprocal ground inspection of key points. By the overwhelming vote of 56\r\nto 7, the United Nations on December 16 endorsed these proposals and gave\r\nthem a top priority. Thereby, the issue is placed squarely before the bar\r\nof world opinion. We shall persevere in seeking a general reduction of\r\narmaments under effective inspection and control which are essential\r\nsafeguards to ensure reciprocity and protect the security of all.\r\n\r\nIn the coming year much remains to be done.\r\n\r\nWhile maintaining our military deterrent, we must intensify our efforts to\r\nachieve a just peace. In Asia we shall continue to give help to nations\r\nstruggling to maintain their freedom against the threat of Communist\r\ncoercion or subversion. In Europe we shall endeavor to increase not only\r\nthe military strength of the North Atlantic Alliance but also its political\r\ncohesion and unity of purpose. We shall give such assistance as is feasible\r\nto the recently renewed effort of Western European nations to achieve a\r\ngreater measure of integration, such as in the field of peaceful uses of\r\natomic energy.\r\n\r\nIn the Near East we shall spare no effort in seeking to promote a fair\r\nsolution of the tragic dispute between the Arab States and Israel, all of\r\nwhom we want as our friends. The United States is ready to do its part to\r\nassure enduring peace in that area. We hope that both sides will make the\r\ncontributions necessary to achieve that purpose. In Latin America, we shall\r\ncontinue to cooperate vigorously in trade and other measures designed to\r\nassist economic progress in the area.\r\n\r\nStrong economic ties are an essential element in our free world\r\npartnership. Increasing trade and investment help all of us prosper\r\ntogether. Gratifying progress has been made in this direction, most\r\nrecently by the three-year extension of our trade agreements legislation.\r\n\r\nI most earnestly request that the Congress approve our membership in the\r\nOrganization for Trade Cooperation, which would assist the carrying out of\r\nthe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to which we have been a party\r\nsince 1948. Our membership in the OTC will provide the most effective and\r\nexpeditious means for removing discriminations and restrictions against\r\nAmerican exports and in making our trade agreements truly reciprocal.\r\nUnited States membership in the Organization will evidence our continuing\r\ndesire to cooperate in promoting an expanded trade among the free nations.\r\nThus the Organization, as proposed, is admirably suited to our own\r\ninterests and to those of like-minded nations in working for steady\r\nexpansion of trade and closer economic cooperation. Being strictly an\r\nadministrative entity, the Organization for Trade Cooperation cannot, of\r\ncourse, alter the control by Congress of the tariff, import, and customs\r\npolicies of the United States.\r\n\r\nWe need to encourage investment overseas by avoiding unfair tax\r\nduplications, and to foster foreign trade by further simplification and\r\nimprovement of our customs legislation.\r\n\r\nWe must sustain and fortify our Mutual Security Program. Because the\r\nconditions of poverty and unrest in less developed areas make their people\r\na special target of international communism, there is a need to help them\r\nachieve the economic growth and stability necessary to preserve their\r\nindependence against communist threats and enticements.\r\n\r\nIn order that our friends may better achieve the greater strength that is\r\nour common goal, they need assurance of continuity in economic assistance\r\nfor development projects and programs which we approve and which require a\r\nperiod of years for planning and completion. Accordingly, I ask Congress to\r\ngrant limited authority to make longer-term commitments for assistance to\r\nsuch projects, to be fulfilled from appropriations to be made in future\r\nfiscal years.\r\n\r\nThese various steps will powerfully strengthen the economic foundation of\r\nour foreign policy. Together with constructive action abroad, they will\r\nmaintain the present momentum toward general economic progress and vitality\r\nof the free world.\r\n\r\nIn all things, change is the inexorable law of life. In much of the world\r\nthe ferment of change is working strongly; but grave injustices are still\r\nuncorrected. We must not, by any sanction of ours, help to perpetuate these\r\nwrongs. I have particularly in mind the oppressive division of the German\r\npeople, the bondage of millions elsewhere, and the exclusion of Japan from\r\nUnited Nations membership.\r\n\r\nWe shall keep these injustices in the forefront of human consciousness and\r\nseek to maintain the pressure of world opinion to fight these vast wrongs\r\nin the interest both of justice and secure peace.\r\n\r\nInjustice thrives on ignorance. Because an understanding of the truth about\r\nAmerica is one of our most powerful forces, I am recommending a substantial\r\nincrease in budgetary support of the United States Information Agency.\r\n\r\nThe sum of our international effort should be this: the waging of peace,\r\nwith as much resourcefulness, with as great a sense of dedication and\r\nurgency, as we have ever mustered in defense of our country in time of war.\r\nIn this effort, our weapon is not force. Our weapons are the principles and\r\nideas embodied in our historic traditions, applied with the same vigor that\r\nin the past made America a living promise of freedom for all mankind.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish these vital tasks, all of us should be concerned with the\r\nstrength, effectiveness and morale .of our State Department and our Foreign\r\nService.\r\n\r\nAnother guide in the preparation of the Administration's program is:\r\n\r\nTHE CONSTANT IMPROVEMENT OF OUR NATIONAL SECURITY\r\n\r\nBecause peace is the keystone of our national policy, our defense program\r\nemphasizes an effective flexible type of power calculated to deter or\r\nrepulse any aggression and to preserve the peace. Short of war, we have\r\nnever had military strength better adapted to our needs with improved\r\nreadiness for emergency use. The maintenance of this strong military\r\ncapability for the indefinite future will continue to call for a large\r\nshare of our national budget. Our military programs must meet the needs of\r\ntoday. To build less would expose the nation to aggression. To build\r\nexcessively, under the influence of fear, could defeat our purposes and\r\nimpair or destroy the very freedom and economic system our military\r\ndefenses are designed to protect.\r\n\r\nWe have improved the effectiveness and combat readiness of our forces by\r\ndeveloping and making operational new weapons and by integrating the latest\r\nscientific developments, including new atomic weapons, into our military\r\nplans. We continue to push the production of the most modern military\r\naircraft. The development of long-range missiles has been on an accelerated\r\nbasis for some time. We are moving as rapidly as practicable toward\r\nnuclear-powered aircraft and ships. Combat capability, especially in terms\r\nof firepower, has been substantially increased. We have made the\r\nadjustments in personnel permitted by the cessation of the Korean War, the\r\nbuildup of our allies and the introduction of new weapons. The services are\r\nall planning realistically on a long-term basis.\r\n\r\nTo strengthen our continental defenses the United States and Canada, in the\r\nclosest cooperation, have substantially augmented early warning networks.\r\nGreat progress is being made in extending surveillance of the Arctic, the\r\nAtlantic and the Pacific approaches to North America.\r\n\r\nIn the last analysis our real strength lies in the caliber of the men and\r\nwomen in our Armed Forces, active and Reserve. Much has been done to\r\nattract and hold capable military personnel, but more needs to be done.\r\nThis year, I renew my request of last year for legislation to provide\r\nproper medical care for military dependents and a more equitable survivors'\r\nbenefit program. The Administration will prepare additional recommendations\r\ndesigned to achieve the same objectives, including career incentives for\r\nmedical and dental officers and nurses, and increases in the proportion of\r\nregular officers.\r\n\r\nClosely related to the mission of the Defense Department is the task of the\r\nFederal Civil Defense Administration. A particular point of relationship\r\narises from the fact that the key to civil defense is the expanded\r\ncontinental defense program, including the distant early warning system.\r\nOur Federal civil defense authorities have made progress in their program,\r\nand now comprehensive studies are being conducted jointly by the Federal\r\nCivil Defense Administration, the States, and critical target cities to\r\ndetermine the best procedures that can be adopted in case of an atomic\r\nattack. We must strengthen Federal assistance to the States and cities in\r\ndevising the most effective common defense.\r\n\r\nWe have a broad and diversified mobilization base. We have the facilities,\r\nmaterials, skills and knowledge rapidly to expand the production of things\r\nwe need for our defense whenever they are required. But mobilization base\r\nrequirements change with changing technology and strategy. We must maintain\r\nflexibility to meet new requirements. I am requesting, therefore, that the\r\nCongress once again extend the Defense Production Act.\r\n\r\nOf great importance to our nation's security is a continuing alertness to\r\ninternal subversive activity within or without our government. This\r\nAdministration will not relax its efforts to deal forthrightly and\r\nvigorously in protection of this government and its citizens against\r\nsubversion, at the same time fully protecting the constitutional rights of\r\nall citizens.\r\n\r\nA third objective of the Administration is:\r\n\r\nFISCAL INTEGRITY\r\n\r\nA public office is, indeed, a public trust. None of its aspects is more\r\ndemanding than the proper management of the public finances. I refer now\r\nnot only to the indispensable virtues of plain honesty and trustworthiness\r\nbut also to the prudent, effective and conscientious use of tax money. I\r\nrefer also to the attitude of mind that makes efficient and economical\r\nservice to the people a watchword in our government.\r\n\r\nOver the long term, a balanced budget is a sure index to thrifty\r\nmanagement--in a home, in a business or in the Federal Government. When\r\nachievement of a balanced budget is for long put off in a business or home,\r\nbankruptcy is the result. But in similar circumstances a government resorts\r\nto inflation of the money supply. This inevitably results in depreciation\r\nof the value of the money, and an increase in the cost of living. Every\r\ninvestment in personal security is threatened by this process of inflation,\r\nand the real values of the people's savings, whether in the form of\r\ninsurance, bonds, pension and retirement funds or savings accounts are\r\nthereby shriveled.\r\n\r\nWe have made long strides these past three years in bringing our Federal\r\nfinances under control. The deficit for fiscal year 1953 was almost 9-1/2\r\nbillion dollars. Larger deficits seemed certain--deficits which would have\r\ndepreciated the value of the dollar and pushed the cost of living still\r\nhigher. But government waste and extravagance were searched out.\r\nNonessential activities were dropped. Government expenses were carefully\r\nscrutinized. Total spending was cut by 14 billion dollars below the amount\r\nplanned by the previous Administration for the fiscal year 1954.\r\n\r\nThis made possible--and it was appropriate in the existing circumstances of\r\ntransition to a peacetime economy--the largest tax cut in any year in our\r\nhistory. Almost 7-1/2 billion dollars were released and every taxpayer in\r\nthe country benefited. Almost two-thirds of the savings went directly to\r\nindividuals. This tax cut also helped to build up the economy, to make jobs\r\nin industry and to increase the production .of the many things desired to\r\nimprove the scale of living for the great majority of Americans.\r\n\r\nThe strong expansion of the economy, coupled with a constant care for\r\nefficiency in government operations and an alert guard against waste and\r\nduplication, has brought us to a prospective balance between income and\r\nexpenditure. This is being done while we continue to strengthen our\r\nmilitary security.\r\n\r\nI expect the budget to be in balance during the fiscal year ending June 30,\r\n1956.\r\n\r\nI shall propose a balanced budget for the next fiscal year ending June 30,\r\n1957.\r\n\r\nBut the balance we are seeking cannot be accomplished without the\r\ncontinuing every-day effort of the Executive and Legislative Branches to\r\nkeep expenditures under control. It will also be necessary to continue all\r\nof the present excise taxes without any reduction and the corporation\r\nincome taxes at their present rates for another year beyond next April\r\n1st.\r\n\r\nIt is unquestionably true that our present tax level is very burdensome\r\nand, in the interest of long term and continuous economic growth, should be\r\nreduced when we prudently can. It is essential, in the sound management of\r\nthe Government's finances, that we be mindful of our enormous national debt\r\nand of the obligation we have toward future Americans to reduce that debt\r\nwhenever we can appropriately do so. Under conditions of high peacetime\r\nprosperity, such as now exist, we can never justify going further into debt\r\nto give ourselves a tax cut at the expense of our children. So, in the\r\npresent state of our financial affairs, I earnestly believe that a tax cut\r\ncan be deemed justifiable only when it will not unbalance the budget, a\r\nbudget which makes provision for some reduction, even though modest, in our\r\nnational debt. In this way we can best maintain fiscal integrity.\r\n\r\nA fourth aim of our program is:\r\n\r\nTO FOSTER A STRONG ECONOMY\r\n\r\nOur competitive enterprise system depends on the energy of free human\r\nbeings, limited by prudent restraints in law, using free markets to plan,\r\norganize and distribute production, and spurred by the prospect of reward\r\nfor successful effort. This system has developed our resources. It has\r\nmarvelously expanded our productive capacity. Against the record of all\r\nother economic systems devised through the ages, this competitive system\r\nhas proved the most creative user of human skills in the development of\r\nphysical resources, and the richest rewarder of human effort.\r\n\r\nThis is still true in this era when improved living standards and rising\r\nnational requirements are accompanied by swift advances in technology and\r\nrapid obsolescence in machines and methods. Typical of these are the\r\nstrides made in construction of plants to produce electrical energy from\r\natomic power and of laboratories and installations for the application of\r\nthis new force in industry, agriculture and the healing arts. These\r\ndevelopments make it imperative--to assure effective functioning of our\r\nenterprise system--that the Federal Government concern itself with certain\r\nbroad areas of our economic life. Most important of these is:\r\n\r\nAgriculture\r\n\r\nOur farm people are not sharing as they should in the general prosperity.\r\nThey alone of all major groups have seen their incomes decline rather than\r\nrise. They are caught between two millstones--rising production costs and\r\ndeclining prices. Such harm to a part of the national economy so vitally\r\nimportant to everyone is of great concern to us all. No other resource is\r\nso indispensable as the land that feeds and clothes us. No group is more\r\nfundamental to our national life than our farmers.\r\n\r\nIn successful prosecution of the war, the nation called for the utmost\r\neffort of its farmers. Their response was superb, their contribution\r\nunsurpassed. Farmers are not now to be blamed for the mountainous,\r\nprice-depressing surpluses produced in response to wartime policies and\r\nlaws that were too long continued. War markets are not the markets of\r\npeacetime. Failure to recognize that basic fact by a timely adjustment of\r\nwartime legislation brought its inevitable result in peacetime--surpluses,\r\nlower prices and lower incomes for our farmers.\r\n\r\nThe dimensions of government responsibility are as broad and complex as the\r\nfarm problem itself. We are here concerned not only with our essential\r\ncontinuing supplies of food and fiber, but also with a way of life. Both\r\nare indispensable to the well-being and strength of the nation.\r\nConsideration of these matters must be above and beyond politics. Our\r\nnational farm policy, so vital to the welfare of farm people and all of us,\r\nmust not become a field for political warfare. Too much is at stake.\r\n\r\nOur farm people expect of us, who have responsibility for their government,\r\nunderstanding of their problems and the will to help solve them. Our\r\nobjective must be to help bring production into balance with existing and\r\nnew markets, at prices that yield farmers a return for their work in line\r\nwith what other Americans get.\r\n\r\nTo reach this goal, deep-seated problems must be subjected to a stepped-up\r\nattack. There is no single easy solution. Rather, there must be a\r\nmany-sided assault on the stubborn problems of surpluses, prices, costs,\r\nand markets; and a steady, persistent, imaginative advance in the\r\nrelationship between farmers and their government.\r\n\r\nIn a few days, by special message, I shall lay before the Congress my\r\ndetailed recommendations for new steps that should be taken promptly to\r\nspeed the transition in agriculture and thus assist our farmers to achieve\r\ntheir fair share of the national income.\r\n\r\nBasic to this program will be a new attack on the surplus problem-for even\r\nthe best-conceived farm program cannot work under a multi-billion dollar\r\nweight of accumulated stocks.\r\n\r\nI shall urge authorization of a soil bank program to alleviate the problem\r\nof diverted acres and an overexpanded agricultural plant. This will include\r\nan acreage reserve to reduce current and accumulated surpluses of crops in\r\nmost serious difficulty, and a conservation reserve to achieve other needed\r\nadjustments in the use of agricultural resources. I shall urge measures to\r\nstrengthen our surplus disposal activities.\r\n\r\nI shall propose measures to strengthen individual commodity programs, to\r\nremove controls where possible, to reduce carryovers, and to stop further\r\naccumulations of surpluses. I shall ask the Congress to provide substantial\r\nnew funds for an expanded drive on the research front, to develop new\r\nmarkets, new crops, and new uses. The Rural Development Program to better\r\nthe lot of low-income farm families deserves full Congressional support.\r\nThe Great Plains Program must go forward vigorously. Advances on these and\r\nother fronts will pull down the pricedepressing surpluses and raise farm\r\nincome.\r\n\r\nIn this time of testing in agriculture, we should all together, regardless\r\nof party, carry forward resolutely with a sound and forward looking program\r\non which farm people may confidently depend, now and for years to come.\r\n\r\nI shall briefly mention four other subjects directly related to the\r\nwell-being of the economy, preliminary to their fuller discussion in the\r\nEconomic Report and later communications.\r\n\r\nResources Conservation\r\n\r\nI wish to re-emphasize the critical importance of the wise use and\r\nconservation of our great natural resources of land, forests, minerals and\r\nwater and their long-range development consistent with our agricultural\r\npolicy. Water in particular now plays an increasing role in industrial\r\nprocesses, in the irrigation of land, in electric power, as well as in\r\ndomestic uses. At the same time, it has the potential of damage and\r\ndisaster.\r\n\r\nA comprehensive legislative program for water conservation will be\r\nsubmitted to the Congress during the Session. The development of our water\r\nresources cannot be accomplished overnight. The need is such that we must\r\nmake faster progress and without delay. Therefore, I strongly recommend\r\nthat action be taken at this Session on such wholly Federal projects as the\r\nColorado River Storage Project and the Fryingpan-Arkansas Project; on the\r\nJohn Day partnership project, and other projects which provide for\r\ncooperative action between the Federal Government and non-Federal\r\ninterests; and on legislation, which makes provision for Federal\r\nparticipation in small projects under the primary sponsorship of agencies\r\nof State and local government.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year the areas of our National Parks have been expanded,\r\nand new wildlife refuges have been created. The visits of our people to the\r\nParks have increased much more rapidly than have the facilities to care for\r\nthem. The Administration will submit recommendations to provide more\r\nadequate facilities to keep abreast of the increasing interest of our\r\npeople in the great outdoors.\r\n\r\nDisaster Assistance\r\n\r\nA modern community is a complex combination of skills, specialized\r\nbuildings, machines, communications and homes. Most importantly, it\r\ninvolves human lives. Disaster in many forms--by flood, frost, high winds,\r\nfor instance--can destroy on a massive scale in a few hours the labor of\r\nmany years.\r\n\r\nThrough the past three years the Administration has repeatedly moved into\r\naction wherever disaster struck. The extent of State participation in\r\nrelief activities, however, has been far from uniform and, in many cases,\r\nhas been either inadequate or nonexistent. Disaster assistance legislation\r\nrequires overhauling and an experimental program of flood-damage\r\nindemnities should be undertaken. The Administration will make detailed\r\nrecommendations on these subjects.\r\n\r\nArea Redevelopment\r\n\r\nWe must help deal with the pockets of chronic unemployment that here and\r\nthere mar the nation's general industrial prosperity. Economic changes in\r\nrecent years have been often so rapid and far-reaching that areas committed\r\nto a single local resource or industrial activity have found themselves\r\ntemporarily deprived of their markets and their livelihood.\r\n\r\nSuch conditions mean severe hardship for thousands of people as the slow\r\nprocess of adaptation to new circumstances goes on. This process can be\r\nspeeded up. Last year I authorized a major study of the problem to find\r\nadditional steps to supplement existing programs for the redevelopment of\r\nareas of chronic unemployment. Recommendations will be submitted, designed\r\nto supplement, with Federal technical and loan assistance local efforts to\r\nget on with this vital job. Improving such communities must, of course,\r\nremain the primary responsibility of the people living there and of their\r\nStates. But a soundly conceived Federal partnership program can be of real\r\nassistance to them in their efforts.\r\n\r\nHighway Legislation.\r\n\r\nLegislation to provide a modern, interstate highway system is even more\r\nurgent this year than last, for 12 months have now passed in which we have\r\nfallen further behind in road construction needed for the personal safety,\r\nthe general prosperity, the national security of the American people.\r\nDuring the year, the number of motor vehicles has increased from 58 to 61\r\nmillion. During the past year over 38,000 persons lost their lives in\r\nhighway accidents, while the fearful toll of injuries and property damage\r\nhas gone on unabated.\r\n\r\nIn my message of February 22, 1955, I urged that measures be taken to\r\ncomplete the vital 40,000 mile interstate system over a period of 10 years\r\nat an estimated Federal cost of approximately 25 billion dollars. No\r\nprogram was adopted.\r\n\r\nIf we are ever to solve our mounting traffic problem, the whole interstate\r\nsystem must be authorized as one project, to be completed approximately\r\nwithin the specified time. Only in this way can industry efficiently gear\r\nitself to the job ahead. Only in this way can the required planning and\r\nengineering be accomplished without the confusion and waste unavoidable a\r\npiecemeal approach. Furthermore, as I pointed out last year, the pressing\r\nnature of this problem must not lead us to solutions outside the bounds of\r\nsound fiscal management. As in the case of other pressing problems, there\r\nmust be an adequate plan of financing. To continue the drastically needed\r\nimprovement in other national highway systems, I recommend the continuation\r\nof the Federal Aid Highway Program.\r\n\r\nAside from agriculture and the four subjects specifically mentioned, an\r\nintegral part of our efforts to foster a strong and expanding free economy\r\nis keeping open the door of opportunity to new and small enterprises,\r\nchecking monopoly, and preserving a competitive environment. In this past\r\nyear the steady improvement in the economic health of small business has\r\nreinforced the vitality of our competitive economy. We shall continue to\r\nhelp small business concerns to obtain access to adequate financing and to\r\ncompetent counsel on management, production, and marketing problems.\r\n\r\nThrough measures already taken, opportunities for smallbusiness\r\nparticipation in government procurement programs, including military\r\nprocurement, are greatly improved. The effectiveness of these measures will\r\nbecome increasingly apparent. We shall continue to make certain that small\r\nbusiness has a fair opportunity to compete and has an economic environment\r\nin which it may prosper.\r\n\r\nIn my message last year I referred to the appointment of an advisory\r\ncommittee to appraise and report to me on the deficiencies as well as the\r\neffectiveness of existing Federal transportation policies. I have commended\r\nthe fundamental purposes and objectives of the committee's report. I\r\nearnestly recommend that the Congress give prompt attention to the\r\ncommittee's proposals.\r\n\r\nEssential to a prosperous economic environment for all business, small and\r\nlarge--for agriculture and industry and commerce-is efficiency in\r\nGovernment. To that end, exhaustive studies of the entire governmental\r\nstructure were made by the Commission on Intergovernmental Relations and\r\nthe Commission on the Organization of the Executive Branch of the\r\nGovernment--the reports of these Commissions are now under intensive review\r\nand already in the process of implementation in important areas.\r\n\r\nOne specific and most vital governmental function merits study and action\r\nby the Congress. As part of our program of promoting efficiency in\r\nGovernment and getting the fiscal situation in hand, the Post Office\r\nDepartment in the past three years has been overhauled. Nearly one thousand\r\nnew post offices have been provided. Financial practices have been\r\nmodernized, and transportation and operating methods are being constantly\r\nimproved. A new wage and incentive plan for the half million postal\r\nemployees has been established. Never before has the postal system handled\r\nso much mail so quickly and so economically.\r\n\r\nThe Post Office Department faces two serious problems. First, much of its\r\nphysical plant--post offices and other buildings-is obsolete and\r\ninadequate. Many new buildings and the modernization of present ones are\r\nessential if we are to have improved mail service. The second problem is\r\nthe Department's fiscal plight. It now faces an annual deficit of one-half\r\nbillion dollars.\r\n\r\nRecommendations on postal facilities and on additional postal revenues will\r\nbe submitted to the Congress.\r\n\r\nA final consideration in our program planning is:\r\n\r\nTHE RESPONSE TO HUMAN CONCERNS\r\n\r\nA fundamental belief shines forth in this Republic. We believe in the worth\r\nand dignity of the individual. We know that if we are to govern ourselves\r\nwisely--in the tradition of America--we must have the opportunity to\r\ndevelop our individual capacities to the utmost.\r\n\r\nTo fulfill the individual's aspirations in the American way of life, good\r\neducation is fundamental. Good education is the outgrowth of good homes,\r\ngood communities, good churches, and good schools. Today our schools face\r\npressing problems--problems which will not yield to swift and easy\r\nsolutions, or to any single action. They will yield only to a continuing,\r\nactive, formed effort by the people toward achieving better schools.\r\n\r\nThis kind of effort has been spurred by the thousands of conferences held\r\nin recent months by half a million citizens and educators in all parts of\r\nthe country, culminating in the White House Conference on Education. In\r\nthat Conference, some two thousand delegates, broadly representative of the\r\nnation, studied together the problems of the nation's schools.\r\n\r\nThey concluded that the people of the United States must make a greater\r\neffort through their local, State, and Federal Governments to improve the\r\neducation of our youth. This expression from the people must now be\r\ntranslated into action at all levels of government.\r\n\r\nSo far as the Federal share of responsibility is concerned, I urge that the\r\nCongress move promptly to enact an effective program of Federal assistance\r\nto help erase the existing deficit of school classrooms. Such a program,\r\nwhich should be limited to a five-year period, must operate to increase\r\nrather than decrease local and State support of schools and to give the\r\ngreatest help to the States and localities with the least financial\r\nresources. Federal aid should in no way jeopardize the freedom of local\r\nschool systems. There will be presented to the Congress a recommended\r\nprogram of Federal assistance for school construction.\r\n\r\nSuch a program should be accompanied by action to increase services to the\r\nnation's schools by the Office of Education and by legislation to provide\r\ncontinuation of payments to school districts where Federal activities have\r\nimpaired the ability of those districts to provide adequate schools.\r\n\r\nUnder the 1954 Amendments to the old-age and survivors' insurance program,\r\nprotection was extended to some 10 million additional workers and benefits\r\nwere increased. The system now helps protect 9 out of 10 American workers\r\nand their families against loss of income in old age or on the death of the\r\nbreadwinner. The system is sound. It must be kept so. In developing\r\nimprovements in the system, we must give the most careful consideration to\r\npopulation and social trends, and to fiscal requirements. With these\r\nconsiderations in mind, the Administration will present its recommendations\r\nfor further expansion of coverage and other steps which can be taken wisely\r\nat this time.\r\n\r\nOther needs in the area of social welfare include increased child welfare\r\nservices, extension of the program of aid to dependent children,\r\nintensified attack on juvenile delinquency, and special attention to the\r\nproblems of mentally retarded children. The training of more skilled\r\nworkers for these fields and the quest for new knowledge through research\r\nin social welfare are essential. Similarly the problems of our aged people\r\nneed our attention.\r\n\r\nThe nation has made dramatic progress in conquering disease--progress of\r\nprofound human significance which can be greatly accelerated by an\r\nintensified effort in medical research. A well-supported, well-balanced\r\nprogram of research, including basic research, can open new frontiers of\r\nknowledge, prevent and relieve suffering, and prolong life. Accordingly I\r\nshall recommend a substantial increase in Federal funds for the support of\r\nsuch a program. As an integral part of this effort, I shall recommend a new\r\nplan to aid construction of non-Federal medical research and teaching\r\nfacilities and to help provide more adequate support for the training of\r\nmedical research manpower.\r\n\r\nFinally, we must aid in cushioning the heavy and rising costs of illness\r\nand hospitalization to individuals and families. Provision should be made,\r\nby Federal reinsurance or otherwise, to foster extension of voluntary\r\nhealth insurance coverage to many more persons, especially older persons\r\nand those in rural areas. Plans should be evolved to improve protection\r\nagainst the costs of prolonged or severe illness. These measures will help\r\nreduce the dollar barrier between many Americans and the benefits of modern\r\nmedical care.\r\n\r\nThe Administration health program will be submitted to the Congress in\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\nThe response of government to human concerns embraces, of course, other\r\nmeasures of broad public interest, and of special interest to our working\r\nmen and women. The need still exists for improvement of the Labor\r\nManagement Relations Act. The recommendations I submitted to the Congress\r\nlast year take into account not only the interests of labor and management\r\nbut also the public welfare. The needed amendments should be enacted\r\nwithout further delay.\r\n\r\nWe must also carry forward the job of improving the wagehour law. Last year\r\nI requested the Congress to broaden the coverage of the minimum wage. I\r\nrepeat that recommendation, and I pledge the full resources of the\r\nExecutive Branch to assist the Congress in finding ways to attain this\r\ngoal. Moreover, as requested last year, legislation should be passed to\r\nclarify and strengthen the eight-hour laws for the benefit of workers who\r\nare subject to Federal wage standards on Federal and Federally assisted\r\nconstruction and other public works.\r\n\r\nThe Administration will shortly propose legislation to assure adequate\r\ndisclosure of the financial affairs of each employee pension and welfare\r\nplan and to afford substantial protection to their beneficiaries in\r\naccordance with the objectives outlined in my message of January 11, 1954.\r\nOccupational safety still demands attention, as I pointed out last year,\r\nand legislation to improve the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers'\r\nCompensation Act is still needed. The improvement of the District of\r\nColumbia Unemployment Insurance Law and legislation to provide employees in\r\nthe District with non-occupational disability insurance are no less\r\nnecessary now than 12 months ago. Legislation to apply the principle of\r\nequal pay for equal work without discrimination because of sex is a matter\r\nof simple justice. I earnestly urge the Congress to move swiftly to\r\nimplement these needed labor measures.\r\n\r\nIn the field of human needs, we must carry forward the housing program,\r\nwhich is contributing so greatly to the well-being of our people and the\r\nprosperity of our economy. Home ownership is now advanced to the point\r\nwhere almost three of every five families in our cities, towns, and suburbs\r\nown the houses they live in.\r\n\r\nFor the housing program, most of the legislative authority already exists.\r\nHowever, a firm program of public housing is essential until the private\r\nbuilding industry has found ways to provide more adequate housing for\r\nlow-income families. The Administration will propose authority to contract\r\nfor 35 thousand additional public housing units in each of the next 2\r\nfiscal years for communities which will participate in an integrated attack\r\non slums and blight.\r\n\r\nTo meet the needs of the growing number of older people, several amendments\r\nto the National Housing Act will be proposed to assist the private\r\nhomebuilding industry as well as charitable and non-profit organizations.\r\n\r\nWith so large a number of the American people desiring to modernize and\r\nimprove existing dwellings, I recommend that the Title 1 program for\r\npermanent improvements in the home be liberalized.\r\n\r\nI recommend increases in the general FHA mortgage insurance authority; the\r\nextension of the FHA military housing program; an increase in the\r\nauthorization for Urban Planning grants; in the special assistance\r\nauthority of the Federal National Mortgage Association; and continued\r\nsupport of the college housing program in a way that will not discourage\r\nprivate capital from helping to meet the needs of our colleges.\r\n\r\nThe legislation I have recommended for workers in private industry should\r\nbe accompanied by a parallel effort for the welfare of Government\r\nemployees. We have accomplished much in this field, including a\r\ncontributory life insurance program; equitable pay increases and a fringe\r\nbenefits program, covering many needed personnel policy changes, from\r\nimproved premium pay to a meaningful incentive award program.\r\n\r\nAdditional personnel management legislation is needed in this Session. As I\r\nstated last year, an executive pay increase is essential to efficient\r\ngovernmental management. Such an increase, together with needed adjustments\r\nin the pay for the top career positions, is also necessary to the equitable\r\ncompletion of the Federal pay program initiated last year. Other\r\nlegislation will be proposed, including legislation for prepaid group\r\nhealth insurance for employees and their dependents and to effect major\r\nimprovements in the Civil Service retirement system.\r\n\r\nAll of us share a continuing concern for those who have served this nation\r\nin the Armed Forces. The Commission on Veterans Pensions is at this time\r\nconducting a study of the entire field of veterans' benefits and will soon\r\nsubmit proposed improvements.\r\n\r\nWe are proud of the progress our people have made in the field of civil\r\nrights. In Executive Branch operations throughout the nation, elimination\r\nof discrimination and segregation is all but completed. Progress is also\r\nbeing made among contractors engaged in furnishing Government services and\r\nrequirements. Every citizen now has the opportunity to fit himself for and\r\nto hold a position of responsibility in the service of his country. In the\r\nDistrict of Columbia, through the voluntary cooperation of the people,\r\ndiscrimination and segregation are disappearing from hotels, theaters,\r\nrestaurants and other facilities.\r\n\r\nIt is disturbing that in some localities allegations persist that Negro\r\ncitizens are being deprived of their right to vote and are likewise being\r\nsubjected to unwarranted economic pressures. I recommend that the substance\r\nof these charges be thoroughly examined by a Bipartisan Commission created\r\nby the Congress. It is hoped that such a commission will be established\r\npromptly so that it may arrive at findings which can receive early\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nThe stature of our leadership in the free world has increased through the\r\npast three years because we have made more progress than ever before in a\r\nsimilar period to assure our citizens equality in justice, in opportunity\r\nand in civil rights. We must expand this effort on every front. We must\r\nstrive to have every person judged and measured by what he is, rather than\r\nby his color, race or religion. There will soon be recommended to the\r\nCongress a program further to advance the efforts of the Government, within\r\nthe area of Federal responsibility, to accomplish these objectives.\r\n\r\nOne particular challenge confronts us. In the Hawaiian Islands, East meets\r\nWest. To the Islands, Asia and Europe and the Western Hemisphere, all the\r\ncontinents, have contributed their peoples and their cultures to display a\r\nunique example of a community that is a successful laboratory in human\r\nbrotherhood.\r\n\r\nStatehood, supported by the repeatedly expressed desire of the Islands'\r\npeople and by our traditions, would be a shining example of the American\r\nway to the entire earth. Consequently, I urgently request this Congress to\r\ngrant statehood for Hawaii. Also, in harmony with the provisions I last\r\nyear communicated to the Senate and House Committees on Interior and\r\nInsular Affairs, I trust that progress toward statehood for Alaska can be\r\nmade in this Session.\r\n\r\nProgress is constant toward full integration of our Indian citizens into\r\nnormal community life. During the past two years the Administration has\r\nprovided school facilities for thousands of Indian children previously\r\ndenied this opportunity. We must continue to meet the needs of increased\r\nnumbers of Indian children. Provision should also be made for the education\r\nof adult Indians whose schooling in earlier years was neglected.\r\n\r\nIn keeping with our responsibility of world leadership and in our own self\r\ninterest, I again point out to the Congress the urgent need for revision of\r\nthe immigration and nationality laws. Our nation has always welcomed\r\nimmigrants to our shores. The wisdom of such a policy is clearly shown by\r\nthe fact that America has been built by immigrants and the descendants of\r\nimmigrants. That policy must be continued realistically with present day\r\nconditions in mind.\r\n\r\nI recommend that the number of persons admitted to this country annually be\r\nbased not on the 1920 census but on the latest, the 1950 census. Provision\r\nshould be made to allow for greater flexibility in the use of quotas so if\r\none country does not use its share, the vacancies may be made available for\r\nthe use of qualified individuals from other countries.\r\n\r\nThe law should be amended to permit the Secretary of State and the Attorney\r\nGeneral to waive the requirements of fingerprinting on a reciprocal basis\r\nfor persons coming to this country for temporary visits. This and other\r\nchanges in the law are long overdue and should be taken care of promptly.\r\nDetailed recommendations for revision of the immigration laws will be\r\nsubmitted to the Congress.\r\n\r\nI am happy to report substantial progress in the flow of immigrants under\r\nthe Refugee Relief Act of 1953; however, I again request this Congress to\r\napprove without further delay the urgently needed amendments to that act\r\nwhich I submitted in the last Session. Because of the high prosperity in\r\nGermany and Austria, the number of immigrants from those countries will be\r\nreduced. This will make available thousands of unfilled openings which I\r\nrecommend be distributed to Greece and Italy and to escapees from behind\r\nthe Iron Curtain.\r\n\r\nOnce again I ask the Congress to join with me in demonstrating our belief\r\nin the right of suffrage. I renew my request that the principle of\r\nself-government be extended and the right of suffrage granted to the\r\ncitizens of the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\nTo conclude: the vista before us is bright. The march of science, the\r\nexpanding economy, the advance in collective security toward a just\r\npeace--in this threefold movement our people are creating new standards by\r\nwhich the future of the Republic may be judged.\r\n\r\nProgress, however, will be realized only as it is more than matched by a\r\ncontinuing growth in the spiritual strength of the nation. Our dedication\r\nto moral values must be complete in our dealings abroad and in our\r\nrelationships among ourselves. We have single-minded devotion to the common\r\ngood of America. Never must we forget that this means the well-being, the\r\nprosperity, the security of all Americans in every walk of life.\r\n\r\nTo the attainment of these objectives, I pledge full energies of the\r\nAdministration, as in the Session ahead, it works on a program for\r\nsubmission to you, the Congress of the United States.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nDwight D. Eisenhower\r\nJanuary 10, 1957\r\n\r\nTo the Congress of the United States:\r\n\r\nI appear before the Congress today to report on the State of the Union and\r\nthe relationships of the Union to the other nations of the world. I come\r\nhere, firmly convinced that at no time in the history of the Republic have\r\ncircumstances more emphatically underscored the need, in all echelons of\r\ngovernment, for vision and wisdom and resolution.\r\n\r\nYou meet in a season of stress that is testing the fitness of political\r\nsystems and the validity of political philosophies. Each stress stems in\r\npart from causes peculiar to itself. But every stress is a reflection of a\r\nuniversal phenomenon.\r\n\r\nIn the world today, the surging and understandable tide of nationalism is\r\nmarked by widespread revulsion and revolt against tyranny, injustice,\r\ninequality and poverty. As individuals, joined in a common hunger for\r\nfreedom, men and women and even children pit their spirit against guns and\r\ntanks. On a larger scale, in an ever more persistent search for the\r\nself-respect of authentic sovereignty and the economic base on which\r\nnational independence must rest, peoples sever old ties; seek new\r\nalliances; experiment--sometimes dangerously--in their struggle to satisfy\r\nthese human aspirations.\r\n\r\nParticularly, in the past year, this tide has changed the pattern of\r\nattitudes and thinking among millions. The changes already accomplished\r\nforeshadow a world transformed by the spirit of freedom. This is no faint\r\nand pious hope. The forces now at work in the minds and hearts of men will\r\nnot be spent through many years. In the main, today's expressions of\r\nnationalism are, in spirit, echoes of our forefathers' struggle for\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\nThis Republic cannot be aloof to these events heralding a new epoch in the\r\naffairs of mankind.\r\n\r\nOur pledged word, our enlightened self-interest, our character as a Nation\r\ncommit us to a high role in world affairs: a role of vigorous leadership,\r\nready strength, sympathetic understanding.\r\n\r\nThe State of the Union, at the opening of the 85th Congress continues to\r\nvindicate the wisdom of the principles on which this Republic is rounded.\r\nProclaimed in the Constitution of the Nation and in many of our historic\r\ndocuments, and rounded in devout religious convictions, these principles\r\nenunciate:\r\n\r\nA vigilant regard for human liberty.\r\n\r\nA wise concern for human welfare.\r\n\r\nA ceaseless effort for human progress.\r\n\r\nFidelity to these principles, in our relations with other peoples, has won\r\nus new friendships and has increased our opportunity for service within the\r\nfamily of nations. The appeal of these principles is universal, lighting\r\nfires in the souls of men everywhere. We shall continue to uphold them,\r\nagainst those who deny them and in counselling with our friends.\r\n\r\nAt home, the application of these principles to the complex problems of our\r\nnational life has brought us to an unprecedented peak in our economic\r\nprosperity and has exemplified in our way of life the enduring human values\r\nof mind and spirit.\r\n\r\nThrough the past four years these principles have guided the legislative\r\nprograms submitted by the Administration to the Congress. As we attempt to\r\napply them to current events, domestic and foreign, we must take into\r\naccount the complex entity that is the United States of America; what\r\nendangers it; what can improve it.\r\n\r\nThe visible structure is our American economy itself. After more than a\r\ncentury and a half of constant expansion, it is still rich in a wide\r\nvariety of natural resources. It is first among nations in its people's\r\nmastery of industrial skills. It is productive beyond our own needs of many\r\nfoodstuffs and industrial products. It is rewarding to all our citizens in\r\nopportunity to earn and to advance in self-realization and in\r\nself-expression. It is fortunate in its wealth of educational and cultural\r\nand religious centers. It is vigorously dynamic in the limitless initiative\r\nand willingness to venture that characterize free enterprise. It is\r\nproductive of a widely shared prosperity.\r\n\r\nOur economy is strong, expanding, and fundamentally sound. But in any\r\nrealistic appraisal, even the optimistic analyst will realize that in a\r\nprosperous period the principal threat to efficient functioning of a free\r\nenterprise system is inflation. We look back on four years of prosperous\r\nactivities during which prices, the cost of living, have been relatively\r\nstable--that is, inflation has been held in check. But it is clear that the\r\ndanger is always present, particularly if the government might become\r\nprofligate in its expenditures or private groups might ignore all the\r\npossible results on our economy of unwise struggles for immediate gain.\r\n\r\nThis danger requires a firm resolution that the Federal Government shall\r\nutilize only a prudent share of the Nation's resources, that it shall live\r\nwithin its means, carefully measuring against need alternative proposals\r\nfor expenditures.\r\n\r\nThrough the next four years, I shall continue to insist that the executive\r\ndepartments and agencies of Government search out additional ways to save\r\nmoney and manpower. I urge that the Congress be equally watchful in this\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nWe pledge the Government's share in guarding the integrity of the dollar.\r\nBut the Government's efforts cannot be the entire campaign against\r\ninflation, the thief that can rob the individual of the value of the\r\npension and social security he has earned during his productive life. For\r\nsuccess, Government's efforts must be paralleled by the attitudes and\r\nactions of individual citizens.\r\n\r\nI have often spoken of the purpose of this Administration to serve the\r\nnational interest of 170 million people. The national interest must take\r\nprecedence over temporary advantages which may be secured by particular\r\ngroups at the expense of all the people.\r\n\r\nIn this regard I call on leaders in business and in labor to think well on\r\ntheir responsibility to the American people. With all elements of our\r\nsociety, they owe the Nation a vigilant guard against the inflationary\r\ntendencies that are always at work in a dynamic economy operating at\r\ntoday's high levels. They can powerfully help counteract or accentuate such\r\ntendencies by their wage and price policies.\r\n\r\nBusiness in its pricing policies should avoid unnecessary price increases\r\nespecially at a time like the present when demand in so many areas presses\r\nhard on short supplies. A reasonable profit is essential to the new\r\ninvestments that provide more jobs in an expanding economy. But business\r\nleaders must, in the national interest, studiously avoid those price rises\r\nthat are possible only because of vital or unusual needs of the whole\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nIf our economy is to remain healthy, increases in wages and other labor\r\nbenefits, negotiated by labor and management, must be reasonably related to\r\nimprovements in productivity. Such increases are beneficial, for they\r\nprovide wage earners with greater purchasing power. Except where necessary\r\nto correct obvious injustices, wage increases that outrun productivity,\r\nhowever, are an inflationary factor. They make for higher prices for the\r\npublic generally and impose a particular hardship on those whose welfare\r\ndepends on the purchasing power of retirement income and savings. Wage\r\nnegotiations should also take cognizance of the right of the public\r\ngenerally to share in the benefits of improvements in technology.\r\n\r\nFreedom has been defined as the opportunity for self-discipline. This\r\ndefinition has a special application to the areas of wage and price policy\r\nin a free economy. Should we persistently fail to discipline ourselves,\r\neventually there will be increasing pressure on government to redress the\r\nfailure. By that process freedom will step by step disappear. No subject on\r\nthe domestic scene should more attract the concern of the friends of\r\nAmerican working men and women and of free business enterprise than the\r\nforces that threaten a steady depreciation of the value of our money.\r\n\r\nConcerning developments in another vital sector of our\r\neconomy--agriculture--I am gratified that the long slide in farm income has\r\nbeen halted and that further improvement is in prospect. This is heartening\r\nprogress. Three tools that we have developed--improved surplus disposal,\r\nimproved price support laws, and the soil bank--are working to reduce\r\nprice-depressing government stocks of farm products. Our concern for the\r\nwell-being of farm families demands that we constantly search for new ways\r\nby which they can share more fully in our unprecedented prosperity.\r\nLegislative recommendations in the field of agriculture are contained in\r\nthe Budget Message.\r\n\r\nOur soil, water, mineral, forest, fish, and wildlife resources are being\r\nconserved and improved more effectively. Their conservation and development\r\nare vital to the present and future strength of the Nation. But they must\r\nnot be the concern of the Federal Government alone. State and local\r\nentities, and private enterprise should be encouraged to participate in\r\nsuch projects.\r\n\r\nI would like to make special mention of programs for making the best uses\r\nof water, rapidly becoming our most precious natural resource, just as it\r\ncan be, when neglected, a destroyer of both life and wealth. There has been\r\nprepared and published a comprehensive water report developed by a Cabinet\r\nCommittee and relating to all phases of this particular problem.\r\n\r\nIn the light of this report, there are two things I believe we should keep\r\nconstantly in mind. The first is that each of our great river valleys\r\nshould be considered as a whole. Piecemeal operations within each lesser\r\ndrainage area can be self-defeating or, at the very least, needlessly\r\nexpensive. The second is that the domestic and industrial demands for water\r\ngrow far more rapidly than does our population.\r\n\r\nThe whole matter of making the best use of each drop of water from the\r\nmoment it touches our soil until it reaches the oceans, for such purposes\r\nas irrigation, flood control, power production, and domestic and industrial\r\nuses clearly demands the closest kind of cooperation and partnership\r\nbetween municipalities, States and the Federal Government. Through\r\npartnership of Federal, state and local authorities in these vast projects\r\nwe can obtain the economy and efficiency of development and operation that\r\nsprings from a lively sense of local responsibility.\r\n\r\nUntil such partnership is established on a proper and logical basis of\r\nsharing authority, responsibility and costs, our country will never have\r\nboth the fully productive use of water that it so obviously needs and\r\nprotection against disastrous flood.\r\n\r\nIf we fail in this, all the many tasks that need to be done in America\r\ncould be accomplished only at an excessive cost, by the growth of a\r\nstifling bureaucracy, and eventually with a dangerous degree of centralized\r\ncontrol over our national life.\r\n\r\nIn all domestic matters, I believe that the people of the United States\r\nwill expect of us effective action to remedy past failure in meeting\r\ncritical needs.\r\n\r\nHigh priority should be given the school construction bill. This will\r\nbenefit children of all races throughout the country-and children of all\r\nraces need schools now. A program designed to meet emergency needs for more\r\nclassrooms should be enacted without delay. I am hopeful that this program\r\ncan be enacted on its own merits, uncomplicated by provisions dealing with\r\nthe complex problems of integration. I urge the people in all sections of\r\nthe country to approach these problems with calm and reason, with mutual\r\nunderstanding and good will, and in the American tradition of deep respect\r\nfor the orderly processes of law and justice.\r\n\r\nI should say here that we have much reason to be proud of the progress our\r\npeople are making in mutual understanding--the chief buttress of human and\r\ncivil rights. Steadily we are moving closer to the goal of fair and equal\r\ntreatment of citizens without regard to race or color. But unhappily much\r\nremains to be done.\r\n\r\nLast year the Administration recommended to the Congress a four-point\r\nprogram to reinforce civil rights. That program included:\r\n\r\n(1) creation of a bipartisan commission to investigate asserted violations\r\nof civil rights and to make recommendations;\r\n\r\n(2) creation of a civil rights division in the Department of Justice in\r\ncharge of an Assistant Attorney General;\r\n\r\n(3) enactment by the Congress of new laws to aid in the enforcement of\r\nvoting rights; and\r\n\r\n(4) amendment of the laws so as to permit the Federal Government to seek\r\nfrom the civil courts preventive relief in civil rights cases.\r\n\r\nI urge that the Congress enact this legislation.\r\n\r\nEssential to the stable economic growth we seek is a system of well-adapted\r\nand efficient financial institutions. I believe the time has come to\r\nconduct a broad national inquiry into the nature, performance and adequacy\r\nof our financial system, both in terms of its direct service to the whole\r\neconomy and in terms of its function as the mechanism through which\r\nmonetary and credit policy takes effect. I believe the Congress should\r\nauthorize the creation of a commission of able and qualified citizens to\r\nundertake this vital inquiry. Out of their findings and recommendations the\r\nAdministration would develop and present to the Congress any legislative\r\nproposals that might be indicated for the purpose of improving our\r\nfinancial machinery.\r\n\r\nIn this message it seems unnecessary that I should repeat recommendations\r\ninvolving our domestic affairs that have been urged upon the Congress\r\nduring the past four years, but which, in some instances, did not reach the\r\nstage of completely satisfactory legislation.\r\n\r\nThe Administration will, through future messages either directly from me or\r\nfrom heads of the departments and agencies, transmit to the Congress\r\nspecific recommendations. These will involve our financial and fiscal\r\naffairs, our military and civil defenses; the administration of justice;\r\nour agricultural economy; our domestic and foreign commerce; the urgently\r\nneeded increase in our postal rates; the development of our natural\r\nresources; our labor laws, including our labor-management relations\r\nlegislation, and vital aspects of the health, education and welfare of our\r\npeople. There will be special recommendations dealing with such subjects as\r\natomic energy, the furthering of public works, the continued efforts to\r\neliminate government competition with the businesses of tax-paying\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nA number of legislative recommendations will be mentioned specifically in\r\nmy forthcoming Budget Message, which will reach you within the week. That\r\nmessage will also recommend such sums as are needed to implement the\r\nproposed action.\r\n\r\nTurning to the international scene:\r\n\r\nThe existence of a strongly armed imperialistic dictatorship poses a\r\ncontinuing threat to the free world's and thus to our own Nation's security\r\nand peace. There are certain truths to be remembered here.\r\n\r\nFirst, America alone and isolated cannot assure even its own security. We\r\nmust be joined by the capability and resolution of nations that have proved\r\nthemselves dependable defenders of freedom. Isolation from them invites\r\nwar. Our security is also enhanced by the immeasurable interest that joins\r\nus with all peoples who believe that peace with justice must be preserved,\r\nthat wars of aggression are crimes against humanity.\r\n\r\nAnother truth is that our survival in today's world requires modern,\r\nadequate, dependable military strength. Our Nation has made great strides\r\nin assuring a modern defense, so armed in new weapons, so deployed, so\r\nequipped, that today our security force is the most powerful in our\r\npeacetime history. It can punish heavily any enemy who undertakes to attack\r\nus. It is a major deterrent to war.\r\n\r\nBy our research and development more efficient weapons-some of amazing\r\ncapabilities--are being constantly created. These vital efforts we shall\r\ncontinue. Yet we must not delude ourselves that safety necessarily\r\nincreases as expenditures for military research or forces in being go up.\r\nIndeed, beyond a wise and reasonable level, which is always changing and is\r\nunder constant study, money spent on arms may be money wasted on sterile\r\nmetal or inflated costs, thereby weakening the very security and strength\r\nwe seek.\r\n\r\nNational security requires far more than military power. Economic and moral\r\nfactors play indispensable roles. Any program that endangers our economy\r\ncould defeat us. Any weakening of our national will and resolution, any\r\ndiminution of the vigor and initiative of our individual citizens, would\r\nstrike a blow at the heart of our defenses.\r\n\r\nThe finest military establishment we can produce must work closely in\r\ncooperation with the forces of our friends. Our system of regional pacts,\r\ndeveloped within the Charter of the United Nations, serves to increase both\r\nour own security and the security of other nations.\r\n\r\nThis system is still a recent introduction on the world scene. Its problems\r\nare many and difficult, because it insists on equality among its members\r\nand brings into association some nations traditionally divided. Repeatedly\r\nin recent months, the collapse of these regional alliances has been\r\npredicted. The strains upon them have been at times indeed severe. Despite\r\nthese strains our regional alliances have proved durable and strong, and\r\ndire predictions of their disintegration have proved completely false.\r\n\r\nWith other free nations, we should vigorously prosecute measures that will\r\npromote mutual strength, prosperity and welfare within the free world.\r\nStrength is essentially a product of economic health and social well-being.\r\nConsequently, even as we continue our programs of military assistance, we\r\nmust emphasize aid to our friends in building more productive economies and\r\nin better satisfying the natural demands of their people for progress.\r\nThereby we shall move a long way toward a peaceful world.\r\n\r\nA sound and safeguarded agreement for open skies, unarmed aerial sentinels,\r\nand reduced armament would provide a valuable contribution toward a durable\r\npeace in the years ahead. And we have been persistent in our effort to\r\nreach such an agreement. We are willing to enter any reliable agreement\r\nwhich would reverse the trend toward ever more devastating nuclear weapons;\r\nreciprocally provide against the possibility of surprise attack; mutually\r\ncontrol the outer space missile and satellite development; and make\r\nfeasible a lower level of armaments and armed forces and an easier burden\r\nof military expenditures. Our continuing negotiations in this field are a\r\nmajor part of our quest for a confident peace in this atomic age.\r\n\r\nThis quest requires as well a constructive attitude among all the nations\r\nof the free world toward expansion of trade and investment, that can give\r\nall of us opportunity to work out economic betterment.\r\n\r\nAn essential step in this field is the provision of an administrative\r\nagency to insure the orderly and proper operation of existing arrangements\r\ntrader which multilateral trade is now carried on. To that end I urge\r\nCongressional authorization for United States membership in the proposed\r\nOrganization for Trade Cooperation, an action which will speed removal of\r\ndiscrimination against our export trade.\r\n\r\nWe welcome the efforts of a number of our European friends to achieve an\r\nintegrated community to develop a common market. We likewise welcome their\r\ncooperative effort in the field of atomic energy.\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate once again our unalterable purpose to make of the atom a\r\npeaceful servant of humanity, I shortly shall ask the Congress to authorize\r\nfull United States participation in the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency.\r\n\r\nWorld events have magnified both the responsibilities and the opportunities\r\nof the United States Information Agency. Just as, in recent months, the\r\nvoice of communism has become more shaken and confused, the voice of truth\r\nmust be more clearly heard. To enable our Information Agency to cope with\r\nthese new responsibilities and opportunities, I am asking the Congress to\r\nincrease appreciably the appropriations for this program and for\r\nlegislation establishing a career service for the Agency's overseas foreign\r\nservice officers.\r\n\r\nThe recent historic events in Hungary demand that all free nations share to\r\nthe extent of their capabilities in the responsibility of granting asylum\r\nto victims of Communist persecution. I request the Congress promptly to\r\nenact legislation to regularize the status in the United States of\r\nHungarian refugees brought here as parolees. I shall shortly recommend to\r\nthe Congress by special message the changes in our immigration laws that I\r\ndeem necessary in the light of our world responsibilities.\r\n\r\nThe cost of peace is something we must face boldly, fearlessly. Beyond\r\nmoney, it involves changes in attitudes, the renunciation of old\r\nprejudices, even the sacrifice of some seeming self-interest.\r\n\r\nOnly five days ago I expressed to you the grave concern of your Government\r\nover the threat of Soviet aggression in the Middle East. I asked for\r\nCongressional authorization to help counter this threat. I say again that\r\nthis matter is of vital and immediate importance to the Nation's and the\r\nfree world's security and peace. By our proposed programs in the Middle\r\nEast, we hope to assist in establishing a climate in which constructive and\r\nlong-term solutions to basic problems of the area may be sought.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time, there will be presented to the Congress requests for\r\nother legislation in the broad field of international affairs. All requests\r\nwill reflect the steadfast purpose of this Administration to pursue peace,\r\nbased on justice. Although in some cases details will be new, the\r\nunderlying purpose and objectives will remain the same.\r\n\r\nAll proposals made by the Administration in this field are based on the\r\nfree world's unity. This unity may not be immediately obvious unless we\r\nexamine link by link the chain of relationships that binds us to every area\r\nand to every nation. In spirit the free world is one because its people\r\nuphold the right of independent existence for all nations. I have already\r\nalluded to their economic interdependence. But their interdependence\r\nextends also into the field of security.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, no reasonable man will question the absolute need for our\r\nAmerican neighbors to be prosperous and secure. Their security and\r\nprosperity are inextricably bound to our own. And we are, of course,\r\nalready joined with these neighbors by historic pledges.\r\n\r\nAgain, no reasonable man will deny that the freedom and prosperity and\r\nsecurity of Western Europe are vital to our own prosperity and security. If\r\nthe institutions, the skills, the manpower of its peoples were to fall\r\nunder the domination of an aggressive imperialism, the violent change in\r\nthe balance of world power and in the pattern of world commerce could not\r\nbe fully compensated for by any American measures, military or economic.\r\n\r\nBut these people, whose economic strength is largely dependent on free and\r\nuninterrupted movement of oil from the Middle East, cannot prosper--indeed,\r\ntheir economies would be severely impaired--should that area be controlled\r\nby an enemy and the movement of oil be subject to its decisions.\r\n\r\nNext, to the Eastward, are Asiatic and Far Eastern peoples, recently\r\nreturned to independent control of their own affairs or now emerging into\r\nsovereign statehood. Their potential strength constitutes new assurance for\r\nstability and peace in the world--if they can retain their independence.\r\nShould they lose freedom and be dominated by an aggressor, the world-wide\r\neffects would imperil the security of the free world.\r\n\r\nIn short, the world has so shrunk that all free nations are our neighbors.\r\nWithout cooperative neighbors, the United States cannot maintain its own\r\nsecurity and welfare, because:\r\n\r\nFirst, America's vital interests are world-wide, embracing both hemispheres\r\nand every continent.\r\n\r\nSecond, we have community of interest with every nation in the free world.\r\n\r\nThird, interdependence of interests requires a decent respect for the\r\nrights and the peace of all peoples.\r\n\r\nThese principles motivate our actions within the United Nations. There,\r\nbefore all the world, by our loyalty to them, by our practice of them, let\r\nus strive to set a standard to which all who seek justice and who hunger\r\nfor peace can rally.\r\n\r\nMay we at home, here at the Seat of Government, in all the cities and towns\r\nand farmlands of America, support these principles in a personal effort of\r\ndedication. Thereby each of us can help establish a secure world order in\r\nwhich opportunity for freedom and justice will be more widespread, and in\r\nwhich the resources now dissipated on the armaments of war can be released\r\nfor the life and growth of all humanity.\r\n\r\nWhen our forefathers prepared the immortal document that proclaimed our\r\nindependence, they asserted that every individual is endowed by his Creator\r\nwith certain inalienable rights. As we gaze back through history to that\r\ndate, it is clear that our nation has striven to live up to this\r\ndeclaration, applying it to nations as well as to individuals.\r\n\r\nToday we proudly assert that the government of the United States is still\r\ncommitted to this concept, both in its activities at home and abroad.\r\n\r\nThe purpose is Divine; the implementation is human.\r\n\r\nOur country and its government have made mistakes--human mistakes. They\r\nhave been of the head--not of the heart. And it is still true that the\r\ngreat concept of the dignity of all men, alike created in the image of the\r\nAlmighty, has been the compass by which we have tried and are trying to\r\nsteer our course.\r\n\r\nSo long as we continue by its guidance, there will be true progress in\r\nhuman affairs, both among ourselves and among those with whom we deal.\r\n\r\nTo achieve a more perfect fidelity to it, I submit, is a worthy ambition as\r\nwe meet together in these first days of this, the first session of the 85th\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThe Address as reported from the floor appears in the Congressional Record\r\n(vol. 103, p. 387).\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nDwight D. Eisenhower\r\nJanuary 9, 1958\r\n\r\nMr. President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the 85th Congress:\r\n\r\nIt is again my high privilege to extend personal greetings to the members\r\nof the 85th Congress.\r\n\r\nAll of us realize that, as this new session begins, many Americans are\r\ntroubled about recent world developments which they believe may threaten\r\nour nation's safety. Honest men differ in their appraisal of America's\r\nmaterial and intellectual strength, and the dangers that confront us. But\r\nall know these dangers are real.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this message is to outline the measures that can give the\r\nAmerican people a confidence--just as real--in their own security.\r\n\r\nI am not here to justify the past, gloss over the problems of the present,\r\nor propose easy solutions for the future.\r\n\r\nI am here to state what I believe to be right and what I believe to be\r\nwrong; and to propose action for correcting what I think wrong! I.\r\n\r\nThere are two tasks confronting us that so far outweigh all other that I\r\nshall devote this year's message entirely to them. The first is to ensure\r\nour safety through strength.\r\n\r\nAs to our strength, I have repeatedly voiced this conviction: We now have a\r\nbroadly based and efficient defensive strength, including a great deterrent\r\npower, which is, for the present, our main guarantee against war; but,\r\nunless we act wisely and promptly, we could lose that capacity to deter\r\nattack or defend ourselves.\r\n\r\nMy profoundest conviction is that the American people will say, as one man:\r\nNo matter what the exertions or sacrifices, we shall maintain that\r\nnecessary strength!\r\n\r\nBut we could make no more tragic mistake than merely to concentrate on\r\nmilitary strength.\r\n\r\nFor if we did only this, the future would hold nothing for the world but an\r\nAge of Terror.\r\n\r\nAnd so our second task is to do the constructive work of building a genuine\r\npeace. We must never become so preoccupied with our desire for military\r\nstrength that we neglect those areas of economic development, trade,\r\ndiplomacy, education, ideas and principles where the foundations of real\r\npeace must be laid. II.\r\n\r\nThe threat to our safety, and to the hope of a peaceful world, can be\r\nsimply stated. It is communist imperialism.\r\n\r\nThis threat is not something imagined by critics of the Soviets. Soviet\r\nspokesmen, from the beginning, have publicly and frequently declared their\r\naim to expand their power, one way or another, throughout the world.\r\n\r\nThe threat has become increasingly serious as this expansionist aim has\r\nbeen reinforced by an advancing industrial, military and scientific\r\nestablishment.\r\n\r\nBut what makes the Soviet threat unique in history is its\r\nall--inclusiveness. Every human activity is pressed into service as a\r\nweapon of expansion. Trade, economic development, military power, arts,\r\nscience, education, the whole world of ideas--all are harnessed to this\r\nsame chariot of expansion.\r\n\r\nThe Soviets are, in short, waging total cold war.\r\n\r\nThe only answer to a regime that wages total cold war is to wage total\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nThis means bringing to bear every asset of our personal and national lives\r\nupon the task of building the conditions in which security and peace can\r\ngrow. III.\r\n\r\nAmong our assets, let us first briefly glance at our military power.\r\n\r\nMilitary power serves the cause of security by making prohibitive the cost\r\nof any aggressive attack.\r\n\r\nIt serves the cause of peace by holding up a shield behind which the\r\npatient constructive work of peace can go on.\r\n\r\nBut it can serve neither cause if we make either of two mistakes. The one\r\nwould be to overestimate our strength, and thus neglect crucially important\r\nactions in the period just ahead. The other would be to underestimate our\r\nstrength. Thereby we might be tempted to become irresolute in our foreign\r\nrelations, to dishearten our friends, and to lose our national poise and\r\nperspective in approaching the complex problems ahead.\r\n\r\nAny orderly balance-sheet of military strength must be in two parts. The\r\nfirst is the position as of today. The second is the position in the period\r\nahead.\r\n\r\nAs of today: our defensive shield comprehends a vast complex of ground,\r\nsea, and air units, superbly equipped and strategically deployed around the\r\nworld. The most powerful deterrent to war in the world today lies in the\r\nretaliatory power of our Strategic Air Command and the aircraft of our\r\nNavy. They present to any potential attacker who would unleash war upon the\r\nworld the prospect of virtual annihilation of his own country.\r\n\r\nEven if we assume a surprise attack on our bases, with a marked reduction\r\nin our striking power, our bombers would immediately be on their way in\r\nsufficient strength to accomplish this mission of retaliation. Every\r\ninformed government knows this. It is no secret.\r\n\r\nSince the Korean Armistice, the American people have spent $225 billion in\r\nmaintaining and strengthening this overall defensive shield. This is the\r\nposition as of today.\r\n\r\nNow as to the period ahead: Every part of our military establishment must\r\nand will be equipped to do its defensive job with the most modern weapons\r\nand methods. But it is particularly important to our planning that we make\r\na candid estimate of the effect of long-range ballistic missiles on the\r\npresent deterrent power I have described.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, the consensus of opinion is that we are probably somewhat\r\nbehind the Soviets in some areas of long-range ballistic missile\r\ndevelopment. But it is my conviction, based on close study of all relevant\r\nintelligence, that if we make the necessary effort, we will have the\r\nmissiles, in the needed quantity and in time, to sustain and strengthen the\r\ndeterrent power of our increasingly efficient bombers. One encouraging fact\r\nevidencing this ability is the rate of progress we have achieved since we\r\nbegan to concentrate on these missiles.\r\n\r\nThe intermediate ballistic missiles, Thor and Jupiter, have already been\r\nordered into production. The parallel progress in the intercontinental\r\nballistic missile effort will be advanced by our plans for acceleration.\r\nThe development of the submarine-based Polaris missile system has\r\nprogressed so well that its future procurement schedules are being moved\r\nforward markedly.\r\n\r\nWhen it is remembered that our country has concentrated on the development\r\nof ballistic missiles for only about a third as long as the Soviets, these\r\nachievements show a rate of progress that speaks for itself. Only a brief\r\ntime back, we were spending at the rate of only about one million dollars a\r\nyear on long range ballistic missiles. In 1957 we spent more than one\r\nbillion dollars on the Arias, Titan, Thor, Jupiter, and Polaris programs\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nBut I repeat, gratifying though this rate of progress is, we must still do\r\nmore!\r\n\r\nOur real problem, then, is not our strength today; it is rather the vital\r\nnecessity of action today to ensure our strength tomorrow.\r\n\r\nWhat I have just said applies to our strength as a single country. But we\r\nare not alone. I have returned from the recent NATO meeting with renewed\r\nconviction that, because we are a part of a world-wide community of free\r\nand peaceful nations, our own security is immeasurably increased.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, the Soviet Union has surrounded itself with captive and sullen\r\nnations. Like a crack in the crust of an uneasily sleeping volcano, the\r\nHungarian uprising revealed the depth and intensity of the patriotic\r\nlonging for liberty that still burns within these countries.\r\n\r\nThe world thinks of us as a country which is strong, but which will never\r\nstart a war. The world also thinks of us as a land which has never enslaved\r\nanyone and which is animated by humane ideals. This friendship, based on\r\ncommon ideals, is one of our greatest sources of strength.\r\n\r\nIt cements into a cohesive security arrangement the aggregate of the\r\nspiritual, military and economic strength of all those nations which, with\r\nus, are allied by treaties and agreements.\r\n\r\nUp to this point, I have talked solely about our military strength to deter\r\na possible future war.\r\n\r\nI now want to talk about the strength we need to win a different kind of\r\nwar--one that has already been launched against us.\r\n\r\nIt is the massive economic offensive that has been mounted by the communist\r\nimperialists against free nations.\r\n\r\nThe communist imperialist regimes have for some time been largely\r\nfrustrated in their attempts at expansion based directly on force. As a\r\nresult, they have begun to concentrate heavily on economic penetration,\r\nparticularly of newly-developing countries, as a preliminary to political\r\ndomination.\r\n\r\nThis non-military drive, if underestimated, could defeat the free world\r\nregardless of our military strength. This danger is all the greater\r\nprecisely because many of us fail or refuse to recognize it. Thus, some\r\npeople may be tempted to finance our extra military effort by cutting\r\neconomic assistance. But at the very time when the economic threat is\r\nassuming menacing proportions, to fail to strengthen our own effort would\r\nbe nothing less than reckless folly!\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, most of us did not anticipate the psychological impact upon the\r\nworld of the launching of the first earth satellite. Let us not make the\r\nsame kind of mistake in another field, by failing to anticipate the much\r\nmore serious impact of the Soviet economic offensive.\r\n\r\nAs with our military potential, our economic assets are more than equal to\r\nthe task. Our independent farmers produce an abundance of food and fibre.\r\nOur free workers are versatile, intelligent, and hardworking. Our\r\nbusinessmen are imaginative and resourceful. The productivity, the\r\nadaptability of the American economy is the solid foundation-stone of our\r\nsecurity structure.\r\n\r\nWe have just concluded another prosperous year. Our output was once more\r\nthe greatest in the nation's history. In the latter part of the year, some\r\ndecline in employment and output occurred, following the exceptionally\r\nrapid expansion of recent years. In a free economy, reflecting as it does\r\nthe independent judgments of millions of people, growth typically moves\r\nforward unevenly. But the basic forces of growth remain unimpaired. There\r\nare solid grounds for confidence that economic growth will be resumed\r\nwithout an extended interruption. Moreover, the Federal government,\r\nconstantly alert to signs of weakening in any part of our economy, always\r\nstands ready, with its full power, to take any appropriate further action\r\nto promote renewed business expansion.\r\n\r\nIf our history teaches us anything, it is this lesson: so far as the\r\neconomic potential of our nation is concerned, the believers in the future\r\nof America have always been the realists. I count myself as one of this\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nOur long-range problem, then, is not the stamina of our enormous engine of\r\nproduction. Our problem is to make sure that we use these vast economic\r\nforces confidently and creatively, not only in direct military defense\r\nefforts, but likewise in our foreign policy, through such activities as\r\nmutual economic aid and foreign trade.\r\n\r\nIn much the same way, we have tremendous potential resources on other\r\nnon-military fronts to help in countering the Soviet threat: education,\r\nscience, research, and, not least, the ideas and principles by which we\r\nlive. And in all these cases the task ahead is to bring these resources\r\nmore sharply to bear upon the new tasks of security and peace in a\r\nswiftly-changing world. IV.\r\n\r\nThere are many items in the Administration's program, of a kind frequently\r\nincluded in a State of the Union Message, with which I am not dealing\r\ntoday. They are important to us and to our prosperity. But I am reserving\r\nthem for treatment in separate communications because of my purpose today\r\nof speaking only about matters bearing directly upon our security and\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nI now place before you an outline of action designed to focus our resources\r\nupon the two tasks of security and peace.\r\n\r\nIn this special category I list eight items requiring action. They are not\r\nmerely desirable. They are imperative.\r\n\r\n1. DEFENSE REORGANIZATION\r\n\r\nThe first need is to assure ourselves that military organization\r\nfacilitates rather than hinders the functioning of the military\r\nestablishment in maintaining the security of the nation.\r\n\r\nSince World War II, the purpose of achieving maximum organizational\r\nefficiency in a modern defense establishment has several times occasioned\r\naction by the Congress and by the Executive.\r\n\r\nThe advent of revolutionary new devices, bringing with them the problem of\r\noverall continental defense, creates new difficulties, reminiscent of those\r\nattending the advent of the airplane half a century ago.\r\n\r\nSome of the important new weapons which technology has produced do not fit\r\ninto any existing service pattern. They cut across all services, involve\r\nall services, and transcend all services, at every stage from development\r\nto operation. In some instances they defy classification according to\r\nbranch of service.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the uncertainties resulting from such a situation, and the\r\njurisdictional disputes attending upon it, tend to bewilder and confuse the\r\npublic and create the impression that service differences are damaging the\r\nnational interest.\r\n\r\nLet us proudly remember that the members of the Armed Forces give their\r\nbasic allegiance solely to the United States. Of that fact all of us are\r\ncertain. But pride of service and mistaken zeal in promoting particular\r\ndoctrine has more than once occasioned the kind of difficulty of which I\r\nhave just spoken.\r\n\r\nI am not attempting today to pass judgment on the charge of harmful service\r\nrivalries. But one thing is sure. Whatever they are, America wants them\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\nRecently I have had under special study the never-ending problem of\r\nefficient organization, complicated as it is by new weapons. Soon my\r\nconclusions will be finalized. I shall promptly take such Executive action\r\nas is necessary and, in a separate message, I shall present appropriate\r\nrecommendations to the Congress.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, without anticipating the detailed form that a reorganization\r\nshould take, I can state its main lines in terms of objectives:\r\n\r\nA major purpose of military organization is to achieve real unity in the\r\nDefense establishment in all the principal features of military activities.\r\nOf all these, one of the most important to our nation's security is\r\nstrategic planning and control. This work must be done under unified\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nThe defense structure must be one which, as a whole, can assume, with top\r\nefficiency and without friction, the defense of America. The Defense\r\nestablishment must therefore plan for a better integration of its defensive\r\nresources, particularly with respect to the newer weapons now building and\r\nunder development. These obviously require full coordination in their\r\ndevelopment, production and use. Good organization can help assure this\r\ncoordination.\r\n\r\nIn recognition of the need for single control in some of our most advanced\r\ndevelopment projects, the Secretary of Defense has already decided to\r\nconcentrate into one organization all the anti-missile and satellite\r\ntechnology undertaken within the Department of Defense.\r\n\r\nAnother requirement of military organization is a clear subordination of\r\nthe military services to duly constituted civilian authority. This control\r\nmust be real; not merely on the surface.\r\n\r\nNext there must be assurance that an excessive number of compartments in\r\norganization will not create costly and confusing compartments in our\r\nscientific and industrial effort.\r\n\r\nFinally, to end inter-service disputes requires clear organization and\r\ndecisive central direction, supported by the unstinted cooperation of every\r\nindividual in the defense establishment, civilian and military.\r\n\r\n2. ACCELERATED DEFENSE EFFORT\r\n\r\nThe second major action item is the acceleration of the defense effort in\r\nparticular areas affected by the fast pace of scientific and technological\r\nadvance.\r\n\r\nSome of the points at which improved and increased effort are most\r\nessential are these:\r\n\r\nWe must have sure warning in case of attack. The improvement of warning\r\nequipment is becoming increasingly important as we approach the period when\r\nlong-range missiles will come into use.\r\n\r\nWe must protect and disperse our striking forces and increase their\r\nreadiness for instant reaction. This means more base facilities and standby\r\ncrews.\r\n\r\nWe must maintain deterrent retaliatory power. This means, among other\r\nthings, stepped-up long range missile programs; accelerated programs for\r\nother effective missile systems; and, for some years, more advanced\r\naircraft.\r\n\r\nWe must maintain freedom of the seas. This means nuclear submarines and\r\ncruisers; improved anti-submarine weapons; missile ships; and the like.\r\n\r\nWe must maintain all necessary types of mobile forces to deal with local\r\nconflicts, should there be need. This means further improvements in\r\nequipment, mobility, tactics and fire power.\r\n\r\nThrough increases in pay and incentive, we must maintain in the armed\r\nforces the skilled manpower modern military forces require.\r\n\r\nWe must be forward-looking in our research and development to anticipate\r\nand achieve the unimagined weapons of the future.\r\n\r\nWith these and other improvements, we intend to assure that our vigilance,\r\npower, and technical excellence keep abreast of any realistic threat we\r\nface.\r\n\r\n3. MUTUAL AID\r\n\r\nThird: We must continue to strengthen our mutual security efforts. Most\r\npeople now realize that our programs of military aid and defense support\r\nare an integral part of our own defense effort. If the foundations of the\r\nFree World structure were progressively allowed to crumble under the\r\npressure of communist imperialism, the entire house of freedom would be in\r\ndanger of collapse.\r\n\r\nAs for the mutual economic assistance program, the benefit to us is\r\nthreefold. First, the countries receiving this aid become bulwarks against\r\ncommunist encroachment as their military defenses and economies are\r\nstrengthened. Nations that are conscious of a steady improvement in their\r\nindustry, education, health and standard of living are not apt to fall prey\r\nto the blandishments of communist imperialists.\r\n\r\nSecond, these countries are helped to reach the point where mutually\r\nprofitable trade can expand between them and us.\r\n\r\nThird, the mutual confidence that comes from working together on\r\nconstructive projects creates an atmosphere in which real understanding and\r\npeace can flourish.\r\n\r\nTo help bring these multiple benefits, our economic aid effort should be\r\nmade more effective.\r\n\r\nIn proposals for future economic aid, I am stressing a greater use of\r\nrepayable loans, through the Development Loan Fund, through funds generated\r\nby sale of surplus farm products, and through the Export-Import Bank.\r\n\r\nWhile some increase in Government funds will be required, it remains our\r\nobjective to encourage shifting to the use of private capital sources as\r\nrapidly as possible.\r\n\r\nOne great obstacle to the economic aid program in the past has been, not a\r\nrational argument against it on the merits, but a catchword: \"give-away\r\nprogram.\"\r\n\r\nThe real fact is that no investment we make in our own security and peace\r\ncan pay us greater dividends than necessary amounts of economic aid to\r\nfriendly nations.\r\n\r\nThis is no \"give-away.\"\r\n\r\nLet's stick to facts!\r\n\r\nWe cannot afford to have one of our most essential security programs shot\r\ndown with a slogan!\r\n\r\n4. MUTUAL TRADE\r\n\r\nFourth: Both in our national interest, and in the interest of world peace,\r\nwe must have a five-year extension of the Trade Agreements Act with\r\nbroadened authority to negotiate.\r\n\r\nWorld trade supports a significant segment of American industry and\r\nagriculture. It provides employment for four and one-half million American\r\nworkers. It helps supply our ever increasing demand for raw materials. It\r\nprovides the opportunity for American free enterprise to develop on a\r\nworldwide scale. It strengthens our friends and increases their desire to\r\nbe friends. World trade helps to lay the groundwork for peace by making all\r\nfree nations of the world stronger and more self-reliant.\r\n\r\nAmerica is today the world's greatest trading nation. If we use this great\r\nasset wisely to meet the expanding demands of the world, we shall not only\r\nprovide future opportunities for our own business, agriculture, and labor,\r\nbut in the process strengthen our security posture and other prospects for\r\na prosperous, harmonious world.\r\n\r\nAs President McKinley said, as long ago as 1901: \"Isolation is no longer\r\npossible or desirable .... The period of exclusiveness is past.\"\r\n\r\n5. SCIENTIFIC COOPERATION WITH OUR ALLIES\r\n\r\nFifth: It is of the highest importance that the Congress enact the\r\nnecessary legislation to enable us to exchange appropriate scientific and\r\ntechnical information with friendly countries as part of our effort to\r\nachieve effective scientific cooperation.\r\n\r\nIt is wasteful in the extreme for friendly allies to consume talent and\r\nmoney in solving problems that their friends have already solved--all\r\nbecause of artificial barriers to sharing. We cannot afford to cut\r\nourselves off from the brilliant talents and minds of scientists in\r\nfriendly countries. The task ahead will be hard enough without handcuffs of\r\nour own making.\r\n\r\nThe groundwork for this kind of cooperation has already been laid in\r\ndiscussions among NATO countries. Promptness in following through with\r\nlegislation will be the best possible evidence of American unity of purpose\r\nin cooperating with our friends.\r\n\r\n6. EDUCATION AND RESEARCH\r\n\r\nSixth: In the area of education and research, I recommend a balanced\r\nprogram to improve our resources, involving an investment of about a\r\nbillion dollars over a four year period. This involves new activities by\r\nthe Department of Health, Education and Welfare designed principally to\r\nencourage improved teaching quality and student opportunities in the\r\ninterests of national security. It also provides a five-fold increase in\r\nsums available to the National Science Foundation for its special\r\nactivities in stimulating and improving science education.\r\n\r\nScrupulous attention has been paid to maintaining local control of\r\neducational policy, spurring the maximum amount of local effort, and to\r\navoiding undue stress on the physical sciences at the expense of other\r\nbranches of learning.\r\n\r\nIn the field of research, I am asking for substantial increases in basic\r\nresearch funds, including a doubling of the funds available to the National\r\nScience Foundation for this purpose.\r\n\r\nBut Federal action can do only a part of the job. In both education and\r\nresearch, redoubled exertions will be necessary on the part of all\r\nAmericans if we are to rise to the demands of our times. This means hard\r\nwork on the part of state and local governments, private industry, schools\r\nand colleges, private organizations and foundations, teachers, parents,\r\nand--perhaps most important of all--the student himself, with his bag of\r\nbooks and his homework.\r\n\r\nWith this kind of all-inclusive campaign, I have no doubt that we can\r\ncreate the intellectual capital we need for the years ahead, invest it in\r\nthe right places--and do all this, not as regimented pawns, but as free men\r\nand women!\r\n\r\n7. SPENDING AND SAVING\r\n\r\nSeventh: To provide for this extra effort for security, we must apply stern\r\ntests of priority to other expenditures, both military and civilian. This\r\nextra effort involves, most immediately, the need for a supplemental\r\ndefense appropriation of $1.3 billion for fiscal year 1958.\r\n\r\nIn the 1959 budget, increased expenditures for missiles, nuclear ships,\r\natomic energy, research and development, science and education, a special\r\ncontingency fund to deal with possible new technological discoveries, and\r\nincreases in pay and incentives to obtain and retain competent manpower add\r\nup to a total increase over the comparable figures in the 1957 budget of\r\nabout $4 billion.\r\n\r\nI believe that, in spite of these necessary increases, we should strive to\r\nfinance the 1959 security effort out of expected revenues. While we now\r\nbelieve that expected revenues and expenditures will roughly balance, our\r\nreal purpose will be to achieve adequate security, but always with the\r\nutmost regard for efficiency and careful management.\r\n\r\nThis purpose will require the cooperation of Congress in making careful\r\nanalysis of estimates presented, reducing expenditure on less essential\r\nmilitary programs and installations, postponing some new civilian programs,\r\ntransferring some to the states, and curtailing or eliminating others.\r\n\r\nSuch related matters as the national debt ceiling and tax revenues will be\r\ndealt with in later messages.\r\n\r\n8. WORKS OF PEACE\r\n\r\nMy last call for action is not primarily addressed to the Congress and\r\npeople of the United States. Rather, it is a message from the people of the\r\nUnited States to all other peoples, especially those of the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nThis is the spirit of what we would like to say:\r\n\r\n\"In the last analysis, there is only one solution to the grim problems that\r\nlie ahead. The world must stop the present plunge toward more and more\r\ndestructive weapons of war, and turn the corner that will start our steps\r\nfirmly on the path toward lasting peace.\r\n\r\n\"Our greatest hope for success lies in a universal fact: the people of the\r\nworld, as people, have always wanted peace and want peace now.\r\n\r\n\"The problem, then, is to find a way of translating this universal desire\r\ninto action.\r\n\r\n\"This will require more than words of peace. It requires works of peace.\"\r\n\r\nNow, may I try to give you some concrete examples of the kind of works of\r\npeace that might make a beginning in the new direction.\r\n\r\nFor a start our people should learn to know each other better. Recent\r\nnegotiations in Washington have provided a basis in principle for greater\r\nfreedom of communication and exchange of people. I urge the Soviet\r\ngovernment to cooperate in turning principle into practice by prompt and\r\ntangible actions that will break down the unnatural barriers that have\r\nblocked the flow of thought and understanding between our people.\r\n\r\nAnother kind of work of peace is cooperation on projects of human welfare.\r\nFor example, we now have it within our power to eradicate from the face of\r\nthe earth that age-old scourge of mankind: malaria. We are embarking with\r\nother nations in an all-out five-year campaign to blot out this curse\r\nforever. We invite the Soviets to join with us in this great work of\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\nIndeed, we would be willing to pool our efforts with the Soviets in other\r\ncampaigns against the diseases that are the common enemy of all\r\nmortals--such as cancer and heart disease.\r\n\r\nIf people can get together on such projects, is it not possible that we\r\ncould then go on to a full-scale cooperative program of Science for Peace?\r\n\r\nWe have as a guide and inspiration the success of our Atoms-for-Peace\r\nproposal, which in only a few years, under United Nations auspices, became\r\na reality in the International Atomic Energy Agency.\r\n\r\nA program of Science for Peace might provide a means of funneling into one\r\nplace the results of research from scientists everywhere and from there\r\nmaking it available to all parts of the world.\r\n\r\nThere is almost no limit to the human betterment that could result from\r\nsuch cooperation. Hunger and disease could increasingly be driven from the\r\nearth. The age-old dream of a good life for all could, at long last, be\r\ntranslated into reality.\r\n\r\nBut of all the works of peace, none is more needed now than a real first\r\nstep toward disarmament.\r\n\r\nLast August the United Nations General Assembly, by an overwhelming vote,\r\napproved a disarmament plan that we and our allies sincerely believed to be\r\nfair and practical. The Soviets have rejected both the plan, and the\r\nnegotiating procedure set up by the United Nations. As a result,\r\nnegotiation on this supremely important issue is now at a stand-still.\r\n\r\nBut the world cannot afford to stand still on disarmament! We must never\r\ngive up the search for a basis of agreement.\r\n\r\nOur allies from time to time develop differing ideas on how to proceed. We\r\nmust concert these convictions among ourselves. Thereafter, any reasonable\r\nproposal that holds promise for disarmament and reduction of tension must\r\nbe heard, discussed, and, if possible, negotiated.\r\n\r\nBut a disarmament proposal, to hold real promise, must at the minimum have\r\none feature: reliable means to ensure compliance by all. It takes actions\r\nand demonstrated integrity on both sides to create and sustain confidence.\r\nAnd confidence in a genuine disarmament agreement is vital, not only to the\r\nsigners of the agreement, but also to the millions of people all over the\r\nworld who are weary of tensions and armaments.\r\n\r\nI say once more, to all peoples, that we will always go the extra mile with\r\nanyone on earth if it will bring us nearer a genuine peace.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThese, then, are the ways in which we must funnel our energies more\r\nefficiently into the task of advancing security and peace.\r\n\r\nThese actions demand and expect two things of the American people:\r\nsacrifice, and a high degree of understanding. For sacrifice to be\r\neffective it must be intelligent. Sacrifice must be made for the right\r\npurpose and in the right place--even if that place happens to come close to\r\nhome!\r\n\r\nAfter all, it is no good demanding sacrifice in general terms one day, and\r\nthe next day, for local reasons, opposing the elimination of some unneeded\r\nFederal facility.\r\n\r\nIt is pointless to condemn Federal spending in general, and the next moment\r\ncondemn just as strongly an effort to reduce the particular Federal grant\r\nthat touches one's own interest.\r\n\r\nAnd it makes no sense whatever to spend additional billions on military\r\nstrength to deter a potential danger, and then, by cutting aid and trade\r\nprograms, let the world succumb to a present danger in economic guise.\r\n\r\nMy friends of the Congress: The world is waiting to see how wisely and\r\ndecisively a free representative government will now act.\r\n\r\nI believe that this Congress possesses and will display the wisdom promptly\r\nto do its part in translating into law the actions demanded by our nation's\r\ninterests. But, to make law effective, our kind of government needs the\r\nfull voluntary support of millions of Americans for these actions.\r\n\r\nI am fully confident that the response of the Congress and of the American\r\npeople will make this time of test a time of honor. Mankind then will see\r\nmore clearly than ever that the future belongs, not to the concept of the\r\nregimented atheistic state, but to the people--the God-fearing,\r\npeace-loving people of all the world.\r\n\r\nThe Address as reported from the floor appears in the Congressional Record\r\n(vol. 104, p. 171).\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nDwight D. Eisenhower\r\nJanuary 9, 1959\r\n\r\nMr. President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the 86th Congress, my fellow\r\ncitizens:\r\n\r\nThis is the moment when Congress and the Executive annually begin their\r\ncooperative work to build a better America.\r\n\r\nOne basic purpose unites us: To promote strength and security, side by side\r\nwith liberty and opportunity.\r\n\r\nAs we meet today, in the 170th year of the Republic, our Nation must\r\ncontinue to provide--as all other free governments have had to do\r\nthroughout time--a satisfactory answer to a question as old as history. It\r\nis: Can Government based upon liberty and the God-given rights of man,\r\npermanently endure when ceaselessly challenged by a dictatorship, hostile\r\nto our mode of life, and controlling an economic and military power of\r\ngreat and growing strength?\r\n\r\nFor us the answer has always been found, and is still found in the\r\ndevotion, the vision, the courage and the fortitude of our people.\r\n\r\nMoreover, this challenge we face, not as a single powerful nation, but as\r\none that has in recent decades reached a position of recognized leadership\r\nin the Free World.\r\n\r\nWe have arrived at this position of leadership in an era of remarkable\r\nproductivity and growth. It is also a time when man's power of mass\r\ndestruction has reached fearful proportions.\r\n\r\nPossession of such capabilities helps create world suspicion and tension.\r\nWe, on our part, know that we seek only a just peace for all, with\r\naggressive designs against no one. Yet we realize that there is uneasiness\r\nin the world because of a belief on the part of peoples that through\r\narrogance, miscalculation or fear of attack, catastrophic war could be\r\nlaunched. Keeping the peace in today's world more than ever calls for the\r\nutmost in the nation's resolution, wisdom, steadiness and unremitting\r\neffort.\r\n\r\nWe cannot build peace through desire alone. Moreover, we have learned the\r\nbitter lesson that international agreements, historically considered by us\r\nas sacred, are regarded in Communist doctrine and in practice to be mere\r\nscraps of paper. The most recent proof of their disdain of international\r\nobligations, solemnly undertaken, is their announced intention to abandon\r\ntheir responsibilities respecting Berlin.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence, we can have no confidence in any treaty to which\r\nCommunists are a party except where such a treaty provides within itself\r\nfor self-enforcing mechanisms. Indeed, the demonstrated disregard of the\r\nCommunists of their own pledges is one of the greatest obstacles to success\r\nin substituting the Rule of Law for rule by force.\r\n\r\nYet step by step we must strengthen the institutions of peace--a peace that\r\nrests upon justice--a peace that depends upon a deep knowledge and dear\r\nunderstanding by all peoples of the cause and consequences of possible\r\nfailure in this great purpose.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this peace we seek to prevent war at any place and in any\r\ndimension. If, despite our best efforts, a local dispute should flare into\r\narmed hostilities, the next problem would be to keep the conflict from\r\nspreading, and so compromising freedom. In support of these objectives we\r\nmaintain forces of great power and flexibility.\r\n\r\nOur formidable air striking forces are a powerful deterrent to general war.\r\nLarge and growing portions of these units can depart from their bases in a\r\nmatter of minutes.\r\n\r\nSimilar forces are included in our naval fleets.\r\n\r\nGround and other tactical formations can move with swiftness and precision,\r\nwhen requested by friendly and responsible governments, to help curb\r\nthreatened aggression. The stabilizing influence of this capacity has been\r\ndramatically demonstrated more than once over the past year.\r\n\r\nOur military and related scientific progress has been highly gratifying.\r\n\r\nGreat strides have been made in the development of ballistic missiles.\r\nIntermediate range missiles are now being deployed in operational units.\r\nThe Arias intercontinental ballistic missile program has been marked by\r\nrapid development as evidenced by recent successful tests. Missile training\r\nunits have been established and launching sites are far along in\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\nNew aircraft that fly at twice the speed of sound are entering our\r\nsquadrons.\r\n\r\nWe have successfully placed five satellites in orbit, which have gathered\r\ninformation of scientific importance never before available. Our latest\r\nsatellite illustrates our steady advance in rocketry and foreshadows new\r\ndevelopments in world-wide communications.\r\n\r\nWarning systems constantly improve.\r\n\r\nOur atomic submarines have shattered endurance records and made historic\r\nvoyages under the North Polar Sea.\r\n\r\nA major segment of our national scientific and engineering community is\r\nworking intensively to achieve new and greater developments. Advance in\r\nmilitary technology requires adequate financing but, of course, even more,\r\nit requires talent and time.\r\n\r\nAll this is given only as a matter of history; as a record of our progress\r\nin space and ballistic missile fields in no more than four years of\r\nintensive effort. At the same time we clearly recognize that some of the\r\nrecent Soviet accomplishments in this particular technology are indeed\r\nbrilliant.\r\n\r\nUnder the law enacted last year the Department of Defense is being\r\nreorganized to give the Secretary of Defense full authority over the\r\nmilitary establishment. Greater efficiency, more cohesive effort and\r\nspeedier reaction to emergencies are among the many advantages we are\r\nalready noting from these changes.\r\n\r\nThese few highlights point up our steady military gains. We are rightfully\r\ngratified by the achievements they represent. But we must remember that\r\nthese imposing armaments are purchased at great cost.\r\n\r\nNational Security programs account for nearly sixty percent of the entire\r\nFederal budget for this coming fiscal year.\r\n\r\nModern weapons are exceedingly expensive.\r\n\r\nThe overall cost of introducing ATLAS into our armed forces will average\r\n$35 million per missile on the firing line.\r\n\r\nThis year we are investing an aggregate of close to $7 billion in missile\r\nprograms alone.\r\n\r\nOther billions go for research, development, test and evaluation of new\r\nweapons systems.\r\n\r\nOur latest atomic submarines will cost $50 millions each, while some\r\nspecial types will cost three times as much.\r\n\r\nWe are now ordering fighter aircraft which are priced at fifty times as\r\nmuch as the fighters of World War II.\r\n\r\nWe are buying certain bombers that cost their weight in gold.\r\n\r\nThese sums are tremendous, even when compared with the marvelous resiliency\r\nand capacity of our economy.\r\n\r\nSuch expenditures demand both balance and perspective in our planning for\r\ndefense. At every turn, we must weigh, judge and select. Needless\r\nduplication of weapons and forces must be avoided.\r\n\r\nWe must guard against feverish building of vast armaments to meet glibly\r\npredicted moments of so-called \"maximum peril.\" The threat we face is not\r\nsporadic or dated: It is continuous. Hence we must not be swayed in our\r\ncalculations either by groundless fear or by complacency. We must avoid\r\nextremes, for vacillation between extremes is inefficient, costly, and\r\ndestructive of morale. In these days of unceasing technological advance, we\r\nmust plan our defense expenditures systematically and with care, fully\r\nrecognizing that obsolescence compels the never-ending replacement of older\r\nweapons with new ones.\r\n\r\nThe defense budget for the coming year has been planned on the basis of\r\nthese principles and considerations. Over these many months I have\r\npersonally participated in its development.\r\n\r\nThe aim is a sensible posture of defense. The secondary aim is increased\r\nefficiency and avoidance of waste. Both are achieved by this budgetary\r\nplan.\r\n\r\nWorking by these guide lines I believe with all my heart that America can\r\nbe as sure of the strength and efficiency of her armed forces as she is of\r\ntheir loyalty. I am equally sure that the nation will thus avoid useless\r\nexpenditures which, in the name of security, might tend to undermine the\r\neconomy and, therefore, the nation's safety.\r\n\r\nOur own vast strength is only a part of that required for dependable\r\nsecurity. Because of this we have joined with nearly 50 other nations in\r\ncollective security arrangements. In these common undertakings each nation\r\nis expected to contribute what it can in sharing the heavy load. Each\r\nsupplies part of a strategic deployment to protect the forward boundaries\r\nof freedom.\r\n\r\nConstantly we seek new ways to make more effective our contribution to this\r\nsystem of collective security. Recently I have asked a Committee of eminent\r\nAmericans of both parties to re-appraise our military assistance programs\r\nand the relative emphasis which should be placed on military and economic\r\naid.\r\n\r\nI am hopeful that preliminary recommendations of this Committee will be\r\navailable in time to assist in shaping the Mutual Security program for the\r\ncoming fiscal year.\r\n\r\nAny survey of the free world's defense structure cannot fail to impart a\r\nfeeling of regret that so much of our effort and resources must be devoted\r\nto armaments. At Geneva and elsewhere we continue to seek technical and\r\nother agreements that may help to open up, with some promise, the issues of\r\ninternational disarmament. America will never give up the hope that\r\neventually all nations can, with mutual confidence, drastically reduce\r\nthese non-productive expenditures. II.\r\n\r\nThe material foundation of our national safety is a strong and expanding\r\neconomy. This we have--and this we must maintain. Only with such an economy\r\ncan we be secure and simultaneously provide for the well-being of our\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nA year ago the nation was experiencing a decline in employment and output.\r\nToday that recession is fading into history, and this without gigantic,\r\nhastily-improvised public works projects or untimely tax reductions. A\r\nhealthy and vigorous recovery has been under way since last May. New homes\r\nare being built at the highest rate in several years. Retail sales are at\r\npeak levels. Personal income is at an all-time high.\r\n\r\nThe marked forward thrust of our economy reaffirms our confidence in\r\ncompetitive enterprise. But--clearly--wisdom and prudence in both the\r\npublic and private sectors of the economy are always necessary.\r\n\r\nOur outlook is this: 1960 commitments for our armed forces, the Atomic\r\nEnergy Commission and Military Assistance exceed 47 billion dollars. In the\r\nforeseeable future they are not likely to be significantly lower. With an\r\nannual population increase of three million, other governmental costs are\r\nbound to mount.\r\n\r\nAfter we have provided wisely for our military strength, we must judge how\r\nto allocate our remaining government resources most effectively to promote\r\nour well-being and economic growth.\r\n\r\nFederal programs that will benefit all citizens are moving forward.\r\n\r\nNext year we will be spending increased amounts on health programs; on\r\nFederal assistance to science and education; on the development of the\r\nnation's water resources; on the renewal of urban areas; and on our vast\r\nsystem of Federal-aid highways.\r\n\r\nEach of these additional outlays is being made necessary by the surging\r\ngrowth of America.\r\n\r\nLet me illustrate. Responsive to this growth, Federal grants and long term\r\nloans to assist 14 major types of capital improvements in our cities will\r\ntotal over 2 billion dollars in 1960--double the expenditure of two years\r\nago. The major responsibility for development in these fields rests in the\r\nlocalities, even though the Federal Government will continue to do its\r\nproper part in meeting the genuine needs of a burgeoning population.\r\n\r\nBut the progress of our economy can more than match the growth of our\r\nneeds. We need only to act wisely and confidently.\r\n\r\nHere, I hope you will permit me to digress long enough to express something\r\nthat is much on my mind.\r\n\r\nThe basic question facing us today is more than mere survival--the military\r\ndefense of national life and territory. It is the preservation of a way of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nWe must meet the world challenge and at the same time permit no stagnation\r\nin America.\r\n\r\nUnless we progress, we regress.\r\n\r\nWe can successfully sustain security and remain true to our heritage of\r\nfreedom if we clearly visualize the tasks ahead and set out to perform them\r\nwith resolution and fervor. We must first define these tasks and then\r\nunderstand what we must do to perform them.\r\n\r\nIf progress is to be steady we must have long term guides extending far\r\nahead, certainly five, possibly even ten years. They must reflect the\r\nknowledge that before the end of five years we will have a population of\r\nover 190 million. They must be goals that stand high, and so inspire every\r\ncitizen to climb always toward mounting levels of moral, intellectual and\r\nmaterial strength. Every advance toward them must stir pride in individual\r\nand national achievements.\r\n\r\nTo define these goals, I intend to mobilize help from every available\r\nsource.\r\n\r\nWe need more than politically ordained national objectives to challenge the\r\nbest efforts of free men and women. A group of selfless and devoted\r\nindividuals, outside of government, could effectively participate in making\r\nthe necessary appraisal of the potentials of our future. The result would\r\nbe establishment of national goals that would not only spur us on to our\r\nfinest efforts, but would meet the stern test of practicality.\r\n\r\nThe Committee I plan will comprise educators and representatives of labor,\r\nmanagement, finance, the professions and every other kind of useful\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nSuch a study would update and supplement, in the light of continuous\r\nchanges in our society and its economy, the monumental work of the\r\nCommittee on Recent Social Trends which was appointed in 1931 by President\r\nHoover. Its report has stood the test of time and has had a beneficial\r\ninfluence on national development. The new Committee would be concerned,\r\namong other things, with the acceleration of our economy's growth and the\r\nliving standards of our people, their health and education, their better\r\nassurance of life and liberty and their greater opportunities. It would\r\nalso be concerned with methods to meet such goals and what levels of\r\ngovernment--Local, State, or Federal--might or should be particularly\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nAs one example, consider our schools, operated under the authority of local\r\ncommunities and states. In their capacity and in their quality they conform\r\nto no recognizable standards. In some places facilities are ample, in\r\nothers meager. Pay of teachers ranges between wide limits, from the\r\nadequate to the shameful. As would be expected, quality of teaching varies\r\njust as widely. But to our teachers we commit the most valuable possession\r\nof the nation and of the family--our children.\r\n\r\nWe must have teachers of competence. To obtain and hold them we need\r\nstandards. We need a National Goal. Once established I am certain that\r\npublic opinion would compel steady progress toward its accomplishment.\r\n\r\nSuch studies would be helpful, I believe, to government at all levels and\r\nto all individuals. The goals so established could help us see our current\r\nneeds in perspective. They will spur progress.\r\n\r\nWe do not forget, of course, that our nation's progress and fiscal\r\nintegrity are interdependent and inseparable. We can afford everything we\r\nclearly need, but we cannot afford one cent of waste. We must examine every\r\nitem of governmental expense critically. To do otherwise would betray our\r\nnation's future. Thrift is one of the characteristics that has made this\r\nnation great. Why should we ignore it now?\r\n\r\nWe must avoid any contribution to inflationary processes, which could\r\ndisrupt sound growth in our economy.\r\n\r\nPrices have displayed a welcome stability in recent months and, if we are\r\nwise and resolute, we will not tolerate inflation in the years to come. But\r\nhistory makes clear the risks inherent in any failure to deal firmly with\r\nthe .basic causes of inflation. Two of the most important of these causes\r\nare the wage-price spiral and continued deficit financing.\r\n\r\nInflation would reduce job opportunities, price us out of world markets,\r\nshrink the value of savings and penalize the thrift so essential to finance\r\na growing economy.\r\n\r\nInflation is not a Robin Hood, taking from the rich to give to the poor.\r\nRather, it deals most cruelly with those who can least protect themselves.\r\nIt strikes hardest those millions of our citizens whose incomes do not\r\nquickly rise with the cost of living. When prices soar, the pensioner and\r\nthe widow see their security undermined, the man of thrift sees his savings\r\nmelt away; the white collar worker, the minister, and the teacher see their\r\nstandards of living dragged down.\r\n\r\nInflation can be prevented. But this demands statesmanship on the part of\r\nbusiness and labor leaders and of government at all levels.\r\n\r\nWe must encourage the self-discipline, the restraint necessary to curb the\r\nwage-price spiral and we must meet current costs from current revenue.\r\n\r\nTo minimize the danger of future soaring prices and to keep our economy\r\nsound and expanding, I shall present to the Congress certain proposals.\r\n\r\nFirst, I shall submit a balanced budget for the next year, a year expected\r\nto be the most prosperous in our history. It is a realistic budget with\r\nwholly attainable objectives.\r\n\r\nIf we cannot live within our means during such a time of rising prosperity,\r\nthe hope for fiscal integrity will fade. If we persist in living beyond our\r\nmeans, we make it difficult for every family in our land to balance its own\r\nhousehold budget. But to live within our means would be a tangible\r\ndemonstration of the self-discipline needed to assure a stable dollar.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution entrusts the Executive with many functions, but the\r\nCongress--and the Congress alone--has the power of the purse. Ultimately\r\nupon Congress rests responsibility for determining the scope and amount of\r\nFederal spending.\r\n\r\nBy working together, the Congress and the Executive can keep a balance\r\nbetween income and outgo. If this is done there is real hope that we can\r\nlook forward to a time in the foreseeable future when needed tax reforms\r\ncan be accomplished.\r\n\r\nIn this hope, I am requesting the Secretary of the Treasury to prepare\r\nappropriate proposals for revising, at the proper time, our tax structure,\r\nto remove inequities and to enhance incentives for all Americans to work,\r\nto save, and to invest. Such recommendations will be made as soon as our\r\nfiscal condition permits. These prospects will be brightened if 1960\r\nexpenditures do not exceed the levels recommended.\r\n\r\nSecond, I shall recommend to the Congress that the Chief Executive be given\r\nthe responsibility either to approve or to veto specific items in\r\nappropriations and authorization bills. This would save tax dollars.\r\n\r\nThird, to reduce Federal operations in an area where private enterprise can\r\ndo the job, I shall recommend legislation for greater flexibility in\r\nextending Federal credit, and in improving the procedures under which\r\nprivate credits are insured or guaranteed. Present practices have\r\nneedlessly added large sums to Federal expenditures.\r\n\r\nFourth, action is required to make more effective use of the large Federal\r\nexpenditures for agriculture and to achieve greater fiscal control in this\r\narea.\r\n\r\nOutlays of the Department of Agriculture for the current fiscal year for\r\nthe support of farm prices on a very few farm products will exceed five\r\nbillion dollars. That is a sum equal to approximately two-fifths of the net\r\nincome of all farm operators in the entire United States.\r\n\r\nBy the end of this fiscal year it is estimated that there will be in\r\nGovernment hands surplus farm products worth about nine billion dollars.\r\nAnd by July 1, 1959, Government expenditures for storage, interest, and\r\nhandling of its agricultural inventory will reach a rate of one billion\r\ndollars a year.\r\n\r\nThis level of expenditure for farm products could be made willingly for a\r\ntemporary period if it were leading to a sound solution of the problem. But\r\nunfortunately this is not true. We need new legislation.\r\n\r\nIn the past I have sent messages to the Congress requesting greater freedom\r\nfor our farmers to manage their own farms and greater freedom for markets\r\nto reflect the wishes of producers and consumers. Legislative changes that\r\nfollowed were appropriate in direction but did not go far enough.\r\n\r\nThe situation calls for prompt and forthright action. Recommendation for\r\naction will be contained in a message to be transmitted to the Congress\r\nshortly.\r\n\r\nThese fiscal and related actions will help create an environment of price\r\nstability for economic growth. However, certain additional measures are\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\nI shall ask Congress to amend the Employment Act of 1946 to make it clear\r\nthat Government intends to use all appropriate means to protect the buying\r\npower of the dollar.\r\n\r\nI am establishing a continuing Cabinet group on Price Stability for\r\nEconomic Growth to study governmental and private policies affecting costs,\r\nprices, and economic growth. It will strive also to build a better public\r\nunderstanding of the conditions necessary for maintaining growth and price\r\nstability.\r\n\r\nStudies are being undertaken to improve our information on prices, wages,\r\nand productivity.\r\n\r\nI believe all citizens in all walks of life will support this program of\r\naction to accelerate economic growth and promote price stability. III.\r\n\r\nI take up next certain aspects of our international situation and our\r\nprograms to strengthen it.\r\n\r\nAmerica's security can be assured only within a world community strong,\r\nstable, independent nations, in which the concepts of freedom, justice and\r\nhuman dignity can flourish.\r\n\r\nThere can be no such thing as Fortress America. If ever we were reduced to\r\nthe isolation implied by that term, we would occupy a prison, not a\r\nfortress. The question whether we can afford to help other nations that\r\nwant to defend their freedom but cannot fully do so from their own means,\r\nhas only one answer: we can and we must, we have been doing so since 1947.\r\n\r\nOur foreign policy has long been dedicated to building a permanent and just\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nDuring the past six years our free world security arrangements have been\r\nbolstered and the bonds of freedom have been more closely knit. Our friends\r\nin Western Europe are experiencing new internal vitality, and are\r\nincreasingly more able to resist external threats.\r\n\r\nOver the years the world has come to understand clearly that it is our firm\r\npolicy not to countenance aggression. In Lebanon, Taiwan, and Berlin--our\r\nstand has been dear, right, and expressive of the determined will of a\r\nunited people.\r\n\r\nActing with other free nations we have undertaken the solemn obligation to\r\ndefend the people of free Berlin against any effort to destroy their\r\nfreedom. In the meantime we shall constantly seek meaningful agreements to\r\nsettle this and other problems, knowing full well that not only the\r\nintegrity of a single city, but the hope of all free peoples is at stake.\r\n\r\nWe need, likewise, to continue helping to build the economic base so\r\nessential to the Free World's stability and strength.\r\n\r\nThe International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have both fully proven\r\ntheir worth as instruments of international financial cooperation. Their\r\nExecutive Directors have recommended an increase in each member country's\r\nsubscription. I am requesting the Congress for immediate approval of our\r\nshare of these increases.\r\n\r\nWe are now negotiating with representatives of the twenty Latin American\r\nRepublics for the creation of an inter-American financial institution. Its\r\npurpose would be to join all the American Republics in a common institution\r\nwhich would promote and finance development in Latin America, and make more\r\neffective the use of capital from the World Bank, the Export-Import Bank,\r\nand private sources.\r\n\r\nPrivate enterprise continues to make major contributions to economic\r\ndevelopment in all parts of the world. But we have not yet marshalled the\r\nfull potential of American business for this task, particularly in\r\ncountries which have recently attained their independence. I shall present\r\nto this Congress a program designed to encourage greater participation by\r\nprivate enterprise in economic development abroad.\r\n\r\nFurther, all of us know that to advance the cause of freedom we must do\r\nmuch more than help build sound economies. The spiritual, intellectual, and\r\nphysical strength of people throughout the world will in the last analysis\r\ndetermine their willingness and their ability to resist Communism.\r\n\r\nTo give a single illustration of our many efforts in these fields: We have\r\nbeen a participant in the effort that has been made over the past few years\r\nagainst one of the great scourges of mankind--disease. Through the Mutual\r\nSecurity program public health officials are being trained by American\r\nuniversities to serve in less developed countries. We are engaged in\r\nintensive malaria eradication projects in many parts of the world.\r\nAmerica's major successes in our own country prove the feasibility of\r\nsuccess everywhere.\r\n\r\nBy these and other means we shall continue and expand our campaign against\r\nthe afflictions that now bring needless suffering and death to so many of\r\nthe world's people. We wish to be part of a great shared effort toward the\r\ntriumph of health. IV.\r\n\r\nAmerica is best described by one word, freedom.\r\n\r\nIf we hope to strengthen freedom in the world we must be ever mindful of\r\nhow our own conduct reacts elsewhere. No nation has ever been so\r\nfloodlighted by world opinion as the United States is today. Everything we\r\ndo is carefully scrutinized by other peoples throughout the world. The bad\r\nis seen along with the good.\r\n\r\nBecause we are human we err. But as free men we are also responsible for\r\ncorrecting the errors and imperfections of our ways.\r\n\r\nLast January I made comprehensive recommendations to the Congress for\r\nlegislation in the labor-management field. To my disappointment, Congress\r\nfailed to act. The McClellan Committee disclosures of corruption,\r\nracketeering, and abuse of trust and power in labor-management affairs have\r\naroused America and amazed other peoples. They emphasize the need for\r\nimproved local law enforcement and the enactment of effective Federal\r\nlegislation to protect the public interest and to insure the rights and\r\neconomic freedoms of millions of American workers. Halfhearted measures\r\nwill not do. I shall recommend prompt enactment of legislation designed:\r\n\r\nTo safeguard workers' funds in union treasuries against misuse of any kind\r\nwhatsoever.\r\n\r\nTo protect the rights and freedoms of individual union members, including\r\nthe basic right to free and secret elections of officers.\r\n\r\nTo advance true and responsible collective bargaining.\r\n\r\nTo protect the public and innocent third parties from unfair and coercive\r\npractices such as boycotting and blackmail picketing.\r\n\r\nThe workers and the public must have these vital protections.\r\n\r\nIn other areas of human rights--freedom from discrimination in voting, in\r\npublic education, in access to jobs, and in other respects--the world is\r\nlikewise watching our conduct.\r\n\r\nThe image of America abroad is not improved when school children, through\r\nclosing of some of our schools and through no fault of their own, are\r\ndeprived of their opportunity for an education.\r\n\r\nThe government of a free people has no purpose more noble than to work for\r\nthe maximum realization of equality of opportunity under law. This is not\r\nthe sole responsibility of any one branch of our government. The judicial\r\narm, which has the ultimate authority for interpreting the Constitution,\r\nhas held that certain state laws and practices discriminate upon racial\r\ngrounds and are unconstitutional. Whenever the supremacy of the\r\nConstitution of the United States is challenged I shall continue to take\r\nevery action necessary to uphold it.\r\n\r\nOne of the fundamental concepts of our constitutional system is that it\r\nguarantees to every individual, regardless of race, religion, or national\r\norigin, the equal protection of the laws. Those of us who are privileged to\r\nhold public office have a solemn obligation to make meaningful this\r\ninspiring objective. We can fulfill that obligation by our leadership in\r\nteaching, persuading, demonstrating, and in enforcing the law.\r\n\r\nWe are making noticeable progress in the field of civil rights--we are\r\nmoving forward toward achievement of equality of opportunity for all people\r\neverywhere in the United States. In the interest of the nation and of each\r\nof its citizens, that progress must continue.\r\n\r\nLegislative proposals of the Administration in this field will be submitted\r\nto the Congress early in the session. All of us should help to make clear\r\nthat the government is united in the common purpose of giving support to\r\nthe law and the decisions of the Courts.\r\n\r\nBy moving steadily toward the goal of greater freedom under law, for our\r\nown people, we shall be the better prepared to work for the cause of\r\nfreedom under law throughout the world.\r\n\r\nAll peoples are solely tired of the fear, destruction, and the waste of\r\nwar. As never before, the world knows the human and material costs of war\r\nand seeks to replace force with a genuine role of law among nations.\r\n\r\nIt is my purpose to intensify efforts during the coming two years in\r\nseeking ways to supplement the procedures of the United Nations and other\r\nbodies with similar objectives, to the end that the rule of law may replace\r\nthe rule of force in the affairs of nations. Measures toward this end will\r\nbe proposed later, including a re-examination of our own relation to the\r\nInternational Court of Justice.\r\n\r\nFinally--let us remind ourselves that Marxist scripture is not new; it is\r\nnot the gospel of the future. Its basic objective is dictatorship, old as\r\nhistory. What is new is the shining prospect that man can build a world\r\nwhere all can live in dignity.\r\n\r\nWe seek victory--not over any nation or people--but over the ancient\r\nenemies of us all; victory over ignorance, poverty, disease, and human\r\ndegradation wherever they may be found.\r\n\r\nWe march in the noblest of causes--human freedom.\r\n\r\nIf we make ourselves worthy of America's ideals, if we do not forget that\r\nour nation was founded on the premise that all men are creatures of God's\r\nmaking, the world will come to know that it is free men who carry forward\r\nthe true promise of human progress and dignity.\r\n\r\nThe Address as reported from the floor appears in the Congressional Record\r\nof January 9, 1959 (vol. 105, p. 163).\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nDwight D. Eisenhower\r\nJanuary 7, 1960\r\n\r\nMr. President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the 86th Congress:\r\n\r\nSeven years ago I entered my present office with one long-held resolve\r\noverriding all others. I was then, and remain now, determined that the\r\nUnited States shall become an ever more potent resource for the cause of\r\npeace--realizing that peace cannot be for ourselves alone, but for peoples\r\neverywhere. This determination is shared by the entire Congress--indeed, by\r\nall Americans.\r\n\r\nMy purpose today is to discuss some features of America's position, both at\r\nhome and in her relations to others.\r\n\r\nFirst, I point out that for us, annual self-examination is made a definite\r\nnecessity by the fact that we now live in a divided world of uneasy\r\nequilibrium, with our side committed to its own protection and against\r\naggression by the other.\r\n\r\nWith both sides of this divided world in possession of unbelievably\r\ndestructive weapons, mankind approaches a state where mutual annihilation\r\nbecomes a possibility. No other fact of today's world equals this in\r\nimportance--it colors everything we say, plan, and do.\r\n\r\nThere is demanded of us, vigilance, determination, and the dedication of\r\nwhatever portion of our resources that will provide adequate security,\r\nespecially a real deterrent to aggression. These things we are doing.\r\n\r\nAll these facts emphasize the importance of striving incessantly for a just\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nOnly through the strengthening of the spiritual, intellectual, economic and\r\ndefensive resources of the Free World can we, in confidence, make progress\r\ntoward this goal.\r\n\r\nSecond, we note that recent Soviet deportment and pronouncements suggest\r\nthe possible opening of a somewhat less strained period in the\r\nrelationships between the Soviet Union and the Free World. If these\r\nPronouncements be genuine, there is brighter hope of diminishing the\r\nintensity of past rivalry and eventually of substituting persuasion for\r\ncoercion. Whether this is to become an era of lasting promise remains to be\r\ntested by actions.\r\n\r\nThird, we now stand in the vestibule of a vast new technological age-one\r\nthat, despite its capacity for human destruction, has an equal capacity to\r\nmake poverty and human misery obsolete. If our efforts are wisely\r\ndirected--and if our unremitting efforts for dependable peace begin to\r\nattain some success--we can surely become participants in creating an age\r\ncharacterized by justice and rising levels of human well-being.\r\n\r\nOver the past year the Soviet Union has expressed an interest in measures\r\nto reduce the common peril of war.\r\n\r\nWhile neither we nor any other Free World nation can permit ourselves to be\r\nmisled by pleasant promises until they are tested by performance, yet we\r\napproach this apparently new opportunity with the utmost seriousness. We\r\nmust strive to break the calamitous cycle of frustrations and crises which,\r\nif unchecked, could spiral into nuclear disaster; the ultimate insanity.\r\n\r\nThough the need for dependable agreements to assure against resort to force\r\nin settling disputes is apparent to both sides yet as in other issues\r\ndividing men and nations, we cannot expect sudden and revolutionary\r\nresults. But we must find some place to begin.\r\n\r\nOne obvious road on which to make a useful start is in the widening of\r\ncommunication between our two peoples. In this field there are, both sides\r\nwilling, countless opportunities--most of them well known to us all--for\r\ndeveloping mutual understanding, the true foundation of peace.\r\n\r\nAnother avenue may be through the reopening, on January twelfth, of\r\nnegotiations looking to a controlled ban on the testing of nuclear weapons.\r\nUnfortunately, the closing statement from the Soviet scientists who met\r\nwith our scientists at Geneva in an unsuccessful effort to develop an\r\nagreed basis for a test ban, gives the clear impression that their\r\nconclusions have been politically guided. Those of the British and American\r\nscientific representatives are their own freely-formed, individual and\r\ncollective opinion. I am hopeful that as new negotiations begin, truth--not\r\npolitical opportunism--will be the guiding light of the deliberations.\r\n\r\nStill another avenue may be found in the field of disarmament, in which the\r\nSoviets have professed a readiness to negotiate seriously. They have not,\r\nhowever, made clear the plans they may have, if any, for mutual inspection\r\nand verification--the essential condition for any extensive measure of\r\ndisarmament.\r\n\r\nThere is one instance where our initiative for peace has recently been\r\nsuccessful. A multi-lateral treaty signed last month provides for the\r\nexclusively peaceful use of Antarctica, assured by a system of inspection.\r\nIt provides for free and cooperative scientific research in that continent,\r\nand prohibits nuclear explosions there pending general international\r\nagreement on the subject. The Treaty is a significant contribution toward\r\npeace, international cooperation, and the advancement of science. I shall\r\ntransmit its text to the Senate for consideration and approval in the near\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nThe United States is always ready to participate with the Soviet Union in\r\nserious discussion of these or any other subjects that may lead to peace\r\nwith justice.\r\n\r\nCertainly it is not necessary to repeat that the United States has no\r\nintention of interfering in the internal affairs of any nation; likewise we\r\nreject any attempt to impose its system on us or on other peoples by force\r\nor subversion.\r\n\r\nThis concern for the freedom of other peoples is the intellectual and\r\nspiritual cement which has allied us with more than forty other nations in\r\na common defense effort. Not for a moment do we forget that our own fate is\r\nfirmly fastened to that of these countries; we will not act in any way\r\nwhich would jeopardize our solemn commitments to them.\r\n\r\nWe and our friends are, of course, concerned with self-defense. Growing out\r\nof this concern is the realization that all people of the Free World have a\r\ngreat stake in the progress, in freedom, of the uncommitted and newly\r\nemerging nations. These peoples, desperately hoping to lift themselves to\r\ndecent levels of living must not, by our neglect, be forced to seek help\r\nfrom, and finally become virtual satellites of, those who proclaim their\r\nhostility to freedom.\r\n\r\nTheir natural desire for a better life must not be frustrated by\r\nwithholding from them necessary technical and investment assistance. This\r\nis a problem to be solved not by America alone, but also by every nation\r\ncherishing the same ideals and in position to provide help.\r\n\r\nIn recent years America's partners and friends in Western Europe and Japan\r\nhave made great economic progress. Their newly found economic strength is\r\neloquent testimony to the striking success of the policies of economic\r\ncooperation which we and they have pursued.\r\n\r\nThe international economy of 1960 is markedly different from that of the\r\nearly postwar years. No longer is the United States the only major\r\nindustrial country capable of providing substantial amounts of the\r\nresources so urgently needed in the newly-developing countries.\r\n\r\nTo remain secure and prosperous themselves, wealthy nations must extend the\r\nkind of cooperation to the less fortunate members that will inspire hope,\r\nconfidence and progress. A rich nation can for a time, without noticeable\r\ndamage to itself, pursue a course of self-indulgence, making its single\r\ngoal the material ease and comfort of its own citizens-thus repudiating its\r\nown spiritual and material stake in a peaceful and prosperous society of\r\nnations. But the enmities it will incur, the isolation into which it will\r\ndescend, and the internal moral and physical softness that will be\r\nengendered, will, in the long term, bring it to disaster.\r\n\r\nAmerica did not become great through softness and self-indulgence. Her\r\nmiraculous progress and achievements flow from other qualities far more\r\nworthy and substantial--\r\n\r\n--adherence to principles and methods consonant with our religious\r\nphilosophy\r\n\r\n--a satisfaction in hard work\r\n\r\n--the readiness to sacrifice for worthwhile causes\r\n\r\n--the courage to meet every challenge to her progress\r\n\r\n--the intellectual honesty and capacity to recognize the true path of her\r\nown best interests.\r\n\r\nTo us and to every nation of the Free World, rich or poor, these qualities\r\nare necessary today as never before if we are to march together to greater\r\nsecurity, prosperity and peace.\r\n\r\nI believe the industrial countries are ready to participate actively in\r\nsupplementing the efforts of the developing countries to achieve progress.\r\n\r\nThe immediate need for this kind of cooperation is underscored by the\r\nstrain in our international balance of payments. Our surplus from foreign\r\nbusiness transactions has in recent years fallen substantially short of the\r\nexpenditures we make abroad to maintain our military establishments\r\noverseas, to finance private investment, and to provide assistance to the\r\nless developed nations. In 1959 our deficit in balance of payments\r\napproached $4 billion.\r\n\r\nContinuing deficits of anything like this magnitude would, over time,\r\nimpair our own economic growth and check the forward progress of the Free\r\nWorld.\r\n\r\nWe must meet this situation by promoting a rising volume of exports and\r\nworld trade. Further, we must induce all industrialized nations of the Free\r\nWorld to work together in a new cooperative endeavor to help lift the\r\nscourge of poverty from less fortunate nations. This will provide for\r\nbetter sharing of this burden and for still further profitable trade.\r\n\r\nNew nations, and others struggling with the problems of development, will\r\nprogress only if they demonstrate faith in their own destiny and possess\r\nthe will and use their own resources to fulfill it. Moreover, progress in a\r\nnational transformation can be only gradually earned; there is no easy and\r\nquick way to follow from the oxcart to the jet plane. But, just as we drew\r\non Europe for assistance in our earlier years, so now do those new and\r\nemerging nations that have this faith and determination deserve help.\r\n\r\nOver the last fifteen years, twenty nations have gained political\r\nindependence. Others are doing so each year. Most of them are woefully\r\nlacking in technical capacity and in investment capital; without Free World\r\nsupport in these matters they cannot effectively progress in freedom.\r\n\r\nRespecting their need, one of the major focal points of our concern is the\r\nSouth Asian region. Here, in two nations alone, are almost five hundred\r\nmillion people, all working, and working hard, to raise their standards,\r\nand in doing so, to make of themselves a strong bulwark against the spread\r\nof an ideology that would destroy liberty.\r\n\r\nI cannot express to you the depth of my conviction that, in our own and\r\nFree World interests, we must cooperate with others to help these people\r\nachieve their legitimate ambitions, as expressed in their different\r\nmulti-year plans. Through the World Bank and other instrumentalities, as\r\nwell as through individual action by every nation in position to help, we\r\nmust squarely face this titanic challenge.\r\n\r\nAll of us must realize, of course, that development in freedom by the newly\r\nemerging nations, is no mere matter of obtaining outside financial\r\nassistance. An indispensable element in this process is a strong and\r\ncontinuing determination on the part of these nations to exercise the\r\nnational discipline necessary for any sustained development period. These\r\nqualities of determination are particularly essential because of the fact\r\nthat the process of improvement will necessarily be gradual and laborious\r\nrather than revolutionary. Moreover, everyone should be aware that the\r\ndevelopment process is no short term phenomenon. Many years are required\r\nfor even the most favorably situated countries.\r\n\r\nI shall continue to urge the American people, in the interests of their own\r\nsecurity, prosperity and peace, to make sure that their own part of this\r\ngreat project be amply and cheerfully supported. Free World decisions in\r\nthis matter may spell the difference between world disaster and world\r\nprogress in freedom.\r\n\r\nOther countries, some of which I visited last month, have similar needs.\r\n\r\nA common meeting ground is desirable for those nations which are prepared\r\nto assist in the development effort. During the past year I have discussed\r\nthis matter with the leaders of several Western Nations.\r\n\r\nBecause of its wealth of experience, the Organization for European Economic\r\nCooperation could help with initial studies. The goal is to enlist all\r\navailable economic resources in the industrialized Free World-especially\r\nprivate investment capital. But I repeat that .this help, no matter how\r\ngreat, can be lastingly effective only if it is used as a supplement to the\r\nstrength of spirit and will of the people of the newly-developing nations.\r\n\r\nBy extending this help we hope to make possible the enthusiastic enrollment\r\nof these nations under freedom's banner. No more startling contrast to a\r\nsystem of sullen satellites could be imagined.\r\n\r\nIf we grasp this opportunity to build an age of productive partnership\r\nbetween the less fortunate nations and those that have already achieved a\r\nhigh state of economic advancement, we will make brighter the outlook for a\r\nworld order based upon security, freedom and peace. Otherwise, the outlook\r\ncould be dark indeed. We face what may be a turning point in history, and\r\nwe must act decisively.\r\n\r\nAs a nation we can successfully pursue these objectives only from a\r\nposition of broadly based strength.\r\n\r\nNo matter how earnest is our quest for guaranteed peace, we must maintain a\r\nhigh degree of military effectiveness at the same time we are engaged in\r\nnegotiating the issue of arms reduction. Until tangible and mutually\r\nenforceable arms reduction measures are worked out, we will not weaken the\r\nmeans of defending our institutions.\r\n\r\nAmerica possesses an enormous defense power. It is my studied conviction\r\nthat no nation will ever risk general war against us unless we should be so\r\nfoolish as to neglect the defense forces we now so powerfully support. It\r\nis world-wide knowledge that any nation which might be tempted today to\r\nattack the United States, even though our country might sustain great\r\nlosses, would itself promptly suffer a terrible destruction. But I once\r\nagain assure all peoples and all nations that the United States, except in\r\ndefense, will never turn loose this destructive power.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year, our long-range striking power, unmatched today in\r\nmanned bombers, has taken on new strength as the Atlas intercontinental\r\nballistic missile has entered the operational inventory. In fourteen recent\r\ntest launchings, at ranges of over 5,000 miles, Atlas has been striking on\r\nan average within two miles of the target. This is less than the length of\r\na jet runway--well within the circle of total destruction. Such performance\r\nis a great tribute to American scientists and engineers, who in the past\r\nfive years have had to telescope time and technology to develop these\r\nlong-range ballistic missiles, where America had none before.\r\n\r\nThis year, moreover, growing numbers of nuclear-powered submarines will\r\nenter our active forces, some to be armed with Polaris missiles. These\r\nremarkable ships and weapons, ranging the oceans, will be capable of\r\naccurate fire on targets virtually anywhere on earth. Impossible to destroy\r\nby surprise attack, they will become one of our most effective sentinels\r\nfor peace.\r\n\r\nTo meet situations of less than general nuclear war, we continue to\r\nmaintain our carrier forces, our many service units abroad, our always\r\nready Army strategic forces and Marine Corps divisions, and the civilian\r\ncomponents. The continuing modernization of these forces is a costly but\r\nnecessary process, and is scheduled to go forward at a rate which will\r\nsteadily add to our strength.\r\n\r\nThe deployment of a portion of these forces beyond our shores, on land and\r\nsea, is persuasive demonstration of our determination to stand\r\nshoulder-to-shoulder with our allies for collective security. Moreover, I\r\nhave directed that steps be taken to program our military assistance to\r\nthese allies on a longer range basis. This is necessary for a sounder\r\ncollective defense system.\r\n\r\nNext I refer to our effort in space exploration, which is often mistakenly\r\nsupposed to be an integral part of defense research and development.\r\n\r\nFirst, America has made great contributions in the past two years to the\r\nworld's fund of knowledge of astrophysics and space science. These\r\ndiscoveries are of present interest chiefly to the scientific community;\r\nbut they are important foundation-stones for more extensive exploration of\r\nouter space for the ultimate benefit of all mankind.\r\n\r\nSecond, our military missile program, going forward so successfully, does\r\nnot suffer from our present lack of very large rocket engines, which are so\r\nnecessary in distant space exploration. I am assured by experts that the\r\nthrust of our present missiles is fully adequate for defense requirements.\r\n\r\nThird, the United States is pressing forward in the development of large\r\nrocket engines to place much heavier vehicles into space for exploration\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nFourth, in the meantime, it is necessary to remember that we have only\r\nbegun to probe the environment immediately surrounding the earth. Using\r\nlaunch systems presently available, we are developing satellites to scout\r\nthe world's weather; satellite relay stations to facilitate and extend\r\ncommunications over the globe; for navigation aids to give accurate\r\nbearings to ships and aircraft; and for perfecting instruments to collect\r\nand transmit the data we seek. This is the area holding the most promise\r\nfor early and useful applications of space technology.\r\n\r\nFifth, we have just completed a year's experience with our new space law. I\r\nbelieve it deficient in certain particulars and suggested improvements will\r\nbe submitted shortly.\r\n\r\nThe accomplishment of the many tasks I have alluded to requires the\r\ncontinuous strengthening of the spiritual, intellectual, and economic\r\nsinews of American life. The steady purpose of our society is to assure\r\njustice, before God, for every individual. We must be ever alert that\r\nfreedom does not wither through the careless amassing of restrictive\r\ncontrols or the lack of courage to deal boldly with the giant issues of the\r\nday.\r\n\r\nA year ago, when I met with you, the nation was emerging from an economic\r\ndownturn, even though the signs of resurgent prosperity were not then\r\nsufficiently convincing to the doubtful. Today our surging strength is\r\napparent to everyone. 1960 promises to be the most prosperous year in our\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nYet we continue to be afflicted by nagging disorders.\r\n\r\nAmong current problems that require solution are:\r\n\r\n--the need to protect the public interest in situations of prolonged\r\nlabor-management stalemate;\r\n\r\n--the persistent refusal to come to grips with a critical problem in one\r\nsector of American agriculture;\r\n\r\n--the continuing threat of inflation, together with the persisting tendency\r\ntoward fiscal irresponsibility;\r\n\r\n--in certain instances the denial to some of our citizens of equal\r\nprotection of the law.\r\n\r\nEvery American was disturbed by the prolonged dispute in the steel industry\r\nand the protracted delay in reaching a settlement.\r\n\r\nWe are all relieved that a settlement has at last been achieved in that\r\nindustry. Percentagewise, by this settlement the increase to the steel\r\ncompanies in employment costs is lower than in any prior wage settlement\r\nsince World War II. It is also gratifying to note that despite the increase\r\nin wages and benefits several of the major steel producers have announced\r\nthat there will be no increase in steel prices at this time. The national\r\ninterest demands that in the period of industrial peace which has been\r\nassured by the new contract both management and labor make every possible\r\neffort to increase efficiency and productivity in the manufacture of steel\r\nso that price increases can be avoided.\r\n\r\nOne of the lessons of this story is that the potential danger to the entire\r\nNation of longer and greater strikes must be met. To insure against such\r\npossibilities we must of course depend primarily upon the good commonsense\r\nof the responsible individuals. It is my intention to encourage regular\r\ndiscussions between management and labor outside the bargaining table, to\r\nconsider the interest of the public as well as their mutual interest in the\r\nmaintenance of industrial peace, price stability and economic growth.\r\n\r\nTo me, it seems almost absurd for the United States to recognize the need,\r\nand so earnestly to seek, for cooperation among the nations unless we can\r\nachieve voluntary, dependable, abiding cooperation among the important\r\nsegments of our own free society.\r\n\r\nFailure to face up to basic issues in areas other than those of\r\nlabor-management can cause serious strains on the firm freedom supports of\r\nour society.\r\n\r\nI refer to agriculture as one of these areas.\r\n\r\nOur basic farm laws were written 27 years ago, in an emergency effort to\r\nredress hardship caused by a world-wide depression. They were\r\ncontinued--and their economic distortions intensified--during World War II\r\nin order to provide incentives for production of food needed to sustain a\r\nwar-torn free world.\r\n\r\nToday our farm problem is totally different. It is that of effectively\r\nadjusting to the changes caused by a scientific revolution. When the\r\noriginal farm laws were written, an hour's farm labor produced only one\r\nfourth as much wheat as at present. Farm legislation is woefully\r\nout-of-date, ineffective, and expensive.\r\n\r\nFor years we have gone on with an outmoded system which not only has failed\r\nto protect farm income, but also has produced soaring, threatening\r\nsurpluses. Our farms have been left producing for war while America has\r\nlong been at peace.\r\n\r\nOnce again I urge Congress to enact legislation that will gear production\r\nmore closely to markets, make costly surpluses more manageable, provide\r\ngreater freedom in farm operations, and steadily achieve increased net farm\r\nincomes.\r\n\r\nAnother issue that we must meet squarely is that of living within our\r\nmeans. This requires restraint in expenditure, constant reassessment of\r\npriorities, and the maintenance of stable prices.\r\n\r\nWe must prevent inflation. Here is an opponent of so many guises that it is\r\nsometimes difficult to recognize. But our clear need is to stop continuous\r\nand general price rises--a need that all of us can see and feel.\r\n\r\nTo prevent steadily rising costs and prices calls for stern self-discipline\r\nby every citizen. No person, city, state, or organized group can afford to\r\nevade the obligation to resist inflation, for every American pays its\r\ncrippling tax.\r\n\r\nInflation's ravages do not end at the water's edge. Increases in prices of\r\nthe goods we sell abroad threaten to drive us out of markets that once were\r\nsecurely ours. Whether domestic prices, so high as to be noncompetitive,\r\nresult from demands for too-high profit margins or from increased labor\r\ncosts that outrun growth in productivity, the final result is seriously\r\ndamaging to the nation.\r\n\r\nWe must fight inflation as we would a fire that imperils our home. Only by\r\nso doing can we prevent it from destroying our salaries, savings, pensions\r\nand insurance, and from gnawing away the very roots of a free, healthy\r\neconomy and the nation's security.\r\n\r\nOne major method by which the Federal government can counter inflation and\r\nrising prices is to insure that its expenditures are below its revenues.\r\nThe debt with which we are now confronted is about 290 billion dollars.\r\nWith interest charges alone now costing taxpayers about 9 1/2 billions, it\r\nis clear that this debt growth must stop. You will be glad to know that\r\ndespite the unsettling influences of the recent steel strike, we estimate\r\nthat our accounts will show, on June 30, this year, a favorable balance of\r\napproximately $200 million.\r\n\r\nI shall present to the Congress for 1961 a balanced budget. In the area of\r\ndefense, expenditures continue at the record peace-time levels of the last\r\nseveral years. With a single exception, expenditures in every major\r\ncategory of Health, Education and Welfare will be equal or greater than\r\nlast year. In Space expenditures the amounts are practically doubled. But\r\nthe over-all guiding goal of this budget is national need-not response to\r\nspecific group, local or political insistence.\r\n\r\nExpenditure increases, other than those I have indicated, are largely\r\naccounted for by the increased cost of legislation previously enacted.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: At this point the President interpolated the two paragraphs\r\nshown in brackets.]\r\n\r\n[I repeat, this budget will be a balanced one. Expenditures will be 79\r\nbillion 8 hundred million. The amount of income over outgo, described\r\nin the budget as a Surplus, to be applied against our national debt, is\r\n4 billion 2 hundred million. Personally, I do not feel that any amount can\r\nbe properly called a \"Surplus\" as long as the nation is in debt. I prefer\r\nto think of such an item as \"reduction on our children's inherited\r\nmortgage.\" Once we have established such payments as normal practice, we\r\ncan profitably make improvements in our tax structure and thereby truly\r\nreduce the heavy burdens of taxation.\r\n\r\n[In any event, this one reduction will save taxpayers, each year,\r\napproximately 2 hundred million dollars in interest costs.]\r\n\r\nThis budget will help ease pressures in our credit and capital markets. It\r\nwill enhance the confidence of people all over the world in the strength of\r\nour economy and our currency and in our individual and collective ability\r\nto be fiscally responsible.\r\n\r\nIn the management of the huge public debt the Treasury is unfortunately not\r\nfree of artificial barriers. Its ability to deal with the difficult\r\nproblems in this field has been weakened greatly by the unwillingness of\r\nthe Congress to remove archaic restrictions. The need for a freer hand in\r\ndebt management is even more urgent today because the costs of the\r\nundesirable financing practices which the Treasury has been forced into are\r\nmounting. Removal of this roadblock has high priority in my legislative\r\nrecommendations.\r\n\r\nStill another issue relates to civil rights.\r\n\r\nIn all our hopes and plans for a better world we all recognize that\r\nprovincial and racial prejudices must be combatted. In the long perspective\r\nof history, the right to vote has been one of the strongest pillars of a\r\nfree society. Our first duty is to protect this right against all\r\nencroachment. In spite of constitutional guarantees, and notwithstanding\r\nmuch progress of recent years, bias still deprives some persons in this\r\ncountry of equal protection of the laws.\r\n\r\nEarly in your last session I recommended legislation which would help\r\neliminate several practices discriminating against the basic rights of\r\nAmericans. The Civil Rights Commission has developed additional\r\nconstructive recommendations. I hope that these will be among the matters\r\nto be seriously considered in the current session. I trust that Congress\r\nwill thus signal to the world that our Government is striving for equality\r\nunder law for all our people.\r\n\r\nEach year and in many ways our nation continues to undergo profound change\r\nand growth.\r\n\r\nIn the past 18 months we have hailed the entry of two more States of the\r\nUnion--Alaska and Hawaii. We salute these two western stars proudly.\r\n\r\nOur vigorous expansion, which we all welcome as a sign of health and\r\nvitality, is many-sided. We are, for example, witnessing explosive growth\r\nin metropolitan areas.\r\n\r\nBy 1975 the metropolitan areas of the United States will occupy twice the\r\nterritory they do today. The roster of urban problems with which they must\r\ncope is staggering. They involve water supply, cleaning the air, adjusting\r\nlocal tax systems, providing for essential educational, cultural, and\r\nsocial services, and destroying those conditions which breed delinquency\r\nand crime.\r\n\r\nIn meeting these, we must, if we value our historic freedoms, keep within\r\nthe traditional framework of our Federal system with powers divided between\r\nthe national and state governments. The uniqueness of this system may\r\nconfound the casual observer, but it has worked effectively for nearly 200\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nI do not doubt that our urban and other perplexing problems can be solved\r\nin the traditional American method. In doing so we must realize that\r\nnothing is really solved and ruinous tendencies are set in motion by\r\nyielding to the deceptive bait of the \"easy\" Federal tax dollar.\r\n\r\nOur educational system provides a ready example. All recognize the vital\r\nnecessity of having modern school plants, well-qualified and adequately\r\ncompensated teachers, and of using the best possible teaching techniques\r\nand curricula.\r\n\r\nWe cannot be complacent about educating our youth.\r\n\r\nBut the route to better trained minds is not through the swift\r\nadministration of a Federal hypodermic or sustained financial transfusion.\r\nThe educational process, essentially a local and personal responsibility,\r\ncannot be made to leap ahead by crash, centralized governmental action.\r\n\r\nThe Administration has proposed a carefully reasoned program for helping\r\neliminate current deficiencies. It is designed to stimulate classroom\r\nconstruction, not by substitution of Federal dollars for state and local\r\nfunds, but by incentives to extend and encourage state and local efforts.\r\nThis approach rejects the notion of Federal domination or control. It is\r\nworkable, and should appeal to every American interested in advancement of\r\nour educational system in the traditional American way. I urge the Congress\r\nto take action upon it.\r\n\r\nThere is one other subject concerning which I renew a recommendation I made\r\nin my State of the Union Message last January. I then advised the Congress\r\nof my purpose to intensify our efforts to replace force with a rule of law\r\namong nations. From many discussions abroad, I am convinced that purpose is\r\nwidely and deeply shared by other peoples and nations of the world.\r\n\r\nIn the same Message I stated that our efforts would include a reexamination\r\nof our own relation to the International Court of Justice. The Court was\r\nestablished by the United Nations to decide international legal disputes\r\nbetween nations. In 1946 we accepted the Court's jurisdiction, but subject\r\nto a reservation of the right to determine unilaterally whether a matter\r\nlies essentially within domestic jurisdiction. There is pending before the\r\nSenate, a Resolution which would repeal our present self-judging\r\nreservation. I support that Resolution and urge its prompt passage. If this\r\nis done, I intend to urge similar acceptance of the Court's jurisdiction by\r\nevery member of the United Nations.\r\n\r\nHere perhaps it is not amiss for me to say to the Members of the Congress,\r\nin this my final year of office, a word about the institutions we\r\nrespectively represent and the meaning which the relationships between our\r\ntwo branches has for the days ahead.\r\n\r\nI am not unique as a President in having worked with a Congress controlled\r\nby the opposition party--except that no other President ever did it for\r\nquite so long! Yet in both personal and official relationships we have\r\nweathered the storms of the past five years. For this I am grateful.\r\n\r\nMy deep concern in the next twelve months, before my successor takes\r\noffice, is with our joint Congressional-Executive duty to our own and to\r\nother nations. Acting upon the beliefs I have expressed here today, I shall\r\ndevote my full energies to the tasks at hand, whether these involve travel\r\nfor promoting greater world understanding, negotiations to reduce\r\ninternational discord, or constant discussions and communications with the\r\nCongress and the American people on issues both domestic and foreign.\r\n\r\nIn pursuit of these objectives, I look forward to, and shall dedicate\r\nmyself to, a close and constructive association with the Congress.\r\n\r\nEvery minute spent in irrelevant interbranch wrangling is precious time\r\ntaken from the intelligent initiation and adoption of coherent policies for\r\nour national survival and progress.\r\n\r\nWe seek a common goal--brighter opportunity for our own citizens and a\r\nworld peace with justice for all.\r\n\r\nBefore us and our friends is the challenge of an ideology which, for more\r\nthan four decades, has trumpeted abroad its purpose of gaining ultimate\r\nvictory over all forms of government at variance with its own.\r\n\r\nWe realize that however much we repudiate the tenets of imperialistic\r\nCommunism, it represents a gigantic enterprise grimly pursued by leaders\r\nwho compel its subjects to subordinate their freedom of action and spirit\r\nand personal desires for some hoped-for advantage in the future.\r\n\r\nThe Communists can present an array of material accomplishments over the\r\npast fifteen years that lends a false persuasiveness to many of their\r\nglittering promises to the uncommitted peoples.\r\n\r\nThe competition they provide is formidable.\r\n\r\nBut in our scale of values we place freedom first--our whole national\r\nexistence and development have been geared to that basic concept and are\r\nresponsible for the position of free world leadership to which we have\r\nsucceeded. It is the highest prize that any nation can possess; it is one\r\nthat Communism can never offer. And America's record of material\r\naccomplishment in freedom is written not only in the unparalleled\r\nprosperity of our own nation, but in the many billions we have devoted to\r\nthe reconstruction of Free World economics wrecked by World War II and in\r\nthe effective help of many more billions we have given in saving the\r\nindependence of many others threatened by outside domination. Assuredly we\r\nhave the capacity for handling the problems in the new era of the world's\r\nhistory we are now entering.\r\n\r\nBut we must use that capacity intelligently and tirelessly, regardless of\r\npersonal sacrifice.\r\n\r\nThe fissure that divides our political planet is deep and wide.\r\n\r\nWe live, moreover, in a sea of semantic disorder in which old labels no\r\nlonger faithfully describe.\r\n\r\nPolice states are called \"people's democracies.\"\r\n\r\nArmed conquest of free people is called \"liberation.\"\r\n\r\nSuch slippery slogans make more difficult the problem of communicating true\r\nfaith, facts and beliefs.\r\n\r\nWe must make clear our peaceful intentions, our aspirations for a better\r\nworld. So doing, we must use language to enlighten the mind, not as the\r\ninstrument of the studied innuendo and distorter of truth.\r\n\r\nAnd we must live by what we say.\r\n\r\nOn my recent visit to distant lands I found one statesman after another\r\neager to tell me of the elements of their government that had been borrowed\r\nfrom our American Constitution, and from the indestructible ideals set\r\nforth in our Declaration of Independence.\r\n\r\nAs a nation we take pride that our own constitutional system, and the\r\nideals which sustain it, have been long viewed as a fountainhead of\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\nBy our every action we must strive to make ourselves worthy of this trust,\r\never mindful that an accumulation of seemingly minor encroachments upon\r\nfreedom gradually could break down the entire fabric of a free society.\r\n\r\nSo persuaded, we shall get on with the task before us.\r\n\r\nSo dedicated, and with faith in the Almighty, humanity shall one day\r\nachieve the unity in freedom to which all men have aspired from the dawn of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe Address as reported from the floor appears in the Congressional Record\r\nof January 7, 1960 (vol. 106, p. 135).\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nDwight D. Eisenhower\r\nJanuary 12, 1961\r\n\r\nTo the Congress of the United States:\r\n\r\nOnce again it is my Constitutional duty to assess the state of the Union.\r\n\r\nOn each such previous occasion during these past eight years I have\r\noutlined a forward course designed to achieve our mutual objective--a\r\nbetter America in a world of peace. This time my function is different.\r\n\r\nThe American people, in free election, have selected new leadership which\r\nsoon will be entrusted with the management of our government. A new\r\nPresident shortly will lay before you his proposals to shape the future of\r\nour great land. To him, every citizen, whatever his political beliefs,\r\nprayerfully extends best wishes for good health and for wisdom and success\r\nin coping with the problems that confront our Nation.\r\n\r\nFor my part, I should like, first, to express to you of the Congress, my\r\nappreciation of your devotion to the common good and your friendship over\r\nthese difficult years. I will carry with me pleasant memories of this\r\nassociation in endeavors profoundly significant to all our people.\r\n\r\nWe have been through a lengthy period in which the control over the\r\nexecutive and legislative branches of government has been divided between\r\nour two great political parties. Differences, of course, we have had,\r\nparticularly in domestic affairs. But in a united determination to keep\r\nthis Nation strong and free and to utilize our vast resources for the\r\nadvancement of all mankind, we have carried America to unprecedented\r\nheights.\r\n\r\nFor this cooperative achievement I thank the American people and those in\r\nthe Congress of both parties who have supported programs in the interest of\r\nour country.\r\n\r\nI should also like to give special thanks for the devoted service of my\r\nassociates in the Executive Branch and the hundreds of thousands of career\r\nemployees who have implemented our diverse government programs.\r\n\r\nMy second purpose is to review briefly the record of these past eight years\r\nin the hope that, out of the sum of these experiences, lessons will emerge\r\nthat are useful to our Nation. Supporting this review are detailed reports\r\nfrom the several agencies and departments, all of which are now or will\r\nshortly be available to the Congress.\r\n\r\nThroughout the world the years since 1953 have been a period of profound\r\nchange. The human problems in the world grow more acute hour by hour; yet\r\nnew gains in science and technology continually extend the promise of a\r\nbetter life. People yearn to be free, to govern themselves; yet a third of\r\nthe people of the world have no freedom, do not govern themselves. The\r\nworld recognizes the catastrophic nature of nuclear war; yet it sees the\r\nwondrous potential of nuclear peace.\r\n\r\nDuring the period, the United States has forged ahead under a constructive\r\nforeign policy. The continuing goal is peace, liberty, and well-being--for\r\nothers as well as ourselves. The aspirations of all peoples are one--peace\r\nwith justice in freedom. Peace can only be attained collectively as peoples\r\neverywhere unite in their determination that liberty and well-being come to\r\nall mankind.\r\n\r\nYet while we have worked to advance national aspirations for freedom, a\r\ndivisive force has been at work to divert that aspiration into dangerous\r\nchannels. The Communist movement throughout the world exploits the natural\r\nstriving of all to be free and attempts to subjugate men rather than free\r\nthem. These activities have caused and are continuing to cause grave\r\ntroubles in the world.\r\n\r\nHere at home these have been times for careful adjustment of our economy\r\nfrom the artificial impetus of a hot war to constructive growth in a\r\nprecarious peace. While building a new economic vitality without inflation,\r\nwe have also increased public expenditures to keep abreast of the needs of\r\na growing population and its attendant new problems, as well as our added\r\ninternational responsibilities. We have worked toward these ends in a\r\ncontext of shared responsibility--conscious of the need for maximum scope\r\nto private effort and for State and local, as well as Federal, governmental\r\naction.\r\n\r\nSuccess in designing and executing national purposes, domestically and\r\nabroad, can only come from a steadfast resolution that integrity in the\r\noperation of government and in our relations with each other be fully\r\nmaintained. Only in this way could our spiritual goals be fully advanced.\r\n\r\nFOREIGN POLICY\r\n\r\nOn January 20, 1953, when I took office, the United States was at war.\r\nSince the signing of the Korean Armistice in 1953, Americans have lived in\r\npeace in highly troubled times.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1956 Suez crisis, the United States government strongly\r\nsupported United Nations' action--resulting in the ending of the\r\nhostilities in Egypt.\r\n\r\nAgain in 1958, peace was preserved in the Middle East despite new discord.\r\nOur government responded to the request of the friendly Lebanese Government\r\nfor military help, and promptly withdrew American forces as soon as the\r\nsituation was stabilized.\r\n\r\nIn 1958 our support of the Republic of China during the all-out bombardment\r\nof Quemoy restrained the Communist Chinese from attempting to invade the\r\noff-shore islands.\r\n\r\nAlthough, unhappily, Communist penetration of Cuba is real and poses a\r\nserious threat, Communist dominated regimes have been deposed in Guatemala\r\nand Iran. The occupation of Austria has ended and the Trieste question has\r\nbeen settled.\r\n\r\nDespite constant threats to its integrity, West Berlin has remained free.\r\n\r\nImportant advances have been made in building mutual security\r\narrangements--which lie at the heart of our hopes for future peace and\r\nsecurity in the world. The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization has been\r\nestablished; the NATO alliance has been militarily strengthened; the\r\nOrganization of American States has been further developed as an instrument\r\nof inter-American cooperation; the Anzus treaty has strengthened ties with\r\nAustralia and New Zealand, and a mutual security treaty with Japan has been\r\nsigned. In addition, the CENTO pact has been concluded, and while we are\r\nnot officially a member of this alliance we have participated closely in\r\nits deliberations.\r\n\r\nThe \"Atoms for Peace\" proposal to the United Nations led to the creation of\r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency. Our policy has been to push for\r\nenforceable programs of inspection against surprise attack, suspension of\r\nnuclear testing, arms reduction, and peaceful use of outer space.\r\n\r\nThe United Nations has been vigorously supported in all of its actions,\r\nincluding the condemnations of the wholesale murder of the people of Tibet\r\nby the Chinese Communists and the brutal Soviet repression of the people of\r\nHungary, as well as the more recent UN actions in the Congo.\r\n\r\nThe United States took the initiative in negotiating the significant treaty\r\nto guarantee the peaceful use of vast Antarctica.\r\n\r\nThe United States Information Agency has been transformed into a greatly\r\nimproved medium for explaining our policies and actions to audiences\r\noverseas, answering the lies of communist propaganda, and projecting a\r\nclearer image of American life and culture.\r\n\r\nCultural, technological and educational exchanges with the Soviet Union\r\nhave been encouraged, and a comprehensive agreement was made which\r\nauthorized, among other things, the distribution of our Russian language\r\nmagazine Amerika and the highly successful American Exhibition in Moscow.\r\n\r\nThis country has continued to withhold recognition of Communist China and\r\nto oppose vigorously the admission of this belligerent and unrepentant\r\nnation into the United Nations. Red China has yet to demonstrate that it\r\ndeserves to be considered a \"peace-loving\" nation.\r\n\r\nWith communist imperialism held in check, constructive actions were\r\nundertaken to strengthen the economies of free world nations. The United\r\nStates government has given sturdy support to the economic and technical\r\nassistance activities of the UN. This country stimulated a doubling of the\r\ncapital of the World Bank and a 50 percent capital increase in the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund. The Development Loan Fund and the\r\nInternational Development Association were established. The United States\r\nalso took the lead in creating the Inter-American Development Bank.\r\n\r\nVice President Nixon, Secretaries of State Dulles and Herter and I\r\ntravelled extensively through the world for the purpose of strengthening\r\nthe cause of peace, freedom, and international understanding. So rewarding\r\nwere these visits that their very success became a significant factor in\r\ncausing the Soviet Union to wreck the planned Summit Conference of 1960.\r\n\r\nThese vital programs must go on. New tactics will have to be developed, of\r\ncourse, to meet new situations, but the underlying principles should be\r\nconstant. Our great moral and material commitments to collective security,\r\ndeterrence of force, international law, negotiations that lead to\r\nself-enforcing agreements, and the economic interdependence of free nations\r\nshould remain the cornerstone of a foreign policy that will ultimately\r\nbring permanent peace with justice in freedom to all mankind. The\r\ncontinuing need of all free nations today is for each to recognize clearly\r\nthe essentiality of an unbreakable bond among themselves based upon a\r\ncomplete dedication to the principles of collective security, effective\r\ncooperation and peace with justice.\r\n\r\nNATIONAL DEFENSE\r\n\r\nFor the first time in our nation's history we have consistently maintained\r\nin peacetime, military forces of a magnitude sufficient to deter and if\r\nneed be to destroy predatory forces in the world.\r\n\r\nTremendous advances in strategic weapons systems have been made in the past\r\neight years. Not until 1953 were expenditures on long-range ballistic\r\nmissile programs even as much as a million dollars a year; today we spend\r\nten times as much each day on these programs as was spent in all of 1952.\r\n\r\nNo guided ballistic missiles were operational at the beginning of 1953.\r\nToday many types give our armed forces unprecedented effectiveness. The\r\nexplosive power of our weapons systems for all purposes is almost\r\ninconceivable.\r\n\r\nToday the United States has operational ATLAS missiles which can strike a\r\ntarget 5000 miles away in a half-hour. The POLARIS weapons system became\r\noperational last fall and the TITAN is scheduled to become so this year.\r\nNext year, more than a year ahead of schedule, a vastly improved ICBM, the\r\nsolid propellant MINUTEMAN, is expected to be ready.\r\n\r\nSquadrons of accurate Intermediate Range Ballistic Missiles are now\r\noperational. The THOR and JUPITER IRBMs based in forward areas can hit\r\ntargets 1500 miles away in 18 minutes.\r\n\r\nAircraft which fly at speeds faster than sound were still in a\r\ndevelopmental stage eight years ago. Today American fighting planes go\r\ntwice the speed of sound. And either our B-58 Medium Range Jet Bomber or\r\nour B-52 Long Range Jet Bomber can carry more explosive power than was used\r\nby all combatants in World War II--Allies and Axis combined.\r\n\r\nEight years ago we had no nuclear-powered ships. Today 49 nuclear warships\r\nhave been authorized. Of these, 14 have been commissioned, including three\r\nof the revolutionary POLARIS submarines. Our nuclear submarines have\r\ncruised under the North Pole and circumnavigated the earth while submerged.\r\nSea warfare has been revolutionized, and the United States is far and away\r\nthe leader.\r\n\r\nOur tactical air units overseas and our aircraft carriers are alert; Army\r\nunits, guarding the frontiers of freedom in Europe and the Far East, are in\r\nthe highest state of readiness in peacetime history; our Marines, a third\r\nof whom are deployed in the Far East, are constantly prepared for action;\r\nour Reserve establishment has maintained high standards of proficiency, and\r\nthe Ready Reserve now numbers over 2 1/2 million citizen-soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Defense, a young and still evolving organization, has\r\ntwice been improved and the line of command has been shortened in order to\r\nmeet the demands of modern warfare. These major reorganizations have\r\nprovided a more effective structure for unified planning and direction of\r\nthe vast defense establishment. Gradual improvements in its structure and\r\nprocedures are to be expected.\r\n\r\nUnited States civil defense and nonmilitary defense capacity has been\r\ngreatly strengthened and these activities have been consolidated in one\r\nFederal agency.\r\n\r\nThe defense forces of our Allies now number five million men, several\r\nthousand combatant ships, and over 25,000 aircraft. Programs to strengthen\r\nthese allies have been consistently supported by the Administration. U.S.\r\nmilitary assistance goes almost exclusively to friendly nations on the rim\r\nof the communist world. This American contribution to nations who have the\r\nwill to defend their freedom, but insufficient means, should be vigorously\r\ncontinued. Combined with our Allies, the free world now has a far stronger\r\nshield than we could provide alone.\r\n\r\nSince 1953, our defense policy has been based on the assumption that the\r\ninternational situation would require heavy defense expenditures for an\r\nindefinite period to come, probably for years. In this protracted struggle,\r\ngood management dictates that we resist overspending as resolutely as we\r\noppose under-spending. Every dollar uselessly spent on military mechanisms\r\ndecreases our total strength and, therefore, our security. We must not\r\nreturn to the \"crash-program\" psychology of the past when each new feint by\r\nthe Communists was responded to in panic. The \"bomber gap\" of several years\r\nago was always a fiction, and the \"missile gap\" shows every sign of being\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\nThe nation can ill afford to abandon a national policy which provides for a\r\nfully adequate and steady level of effort, designed for the long pull; a\r\nfast adjustment to new scientific and technological advances; a balanced\r\nforce of such strength as to deter general war, to effectively meet local\r\nsituations and to retaliate to attack and destroy the attacker; and a\r\nstrengthened system of free world collective security.\r\n\r\nTHE ECONOMY\r\n\r\nThe expanding American economy passed the half-trillion dollar mark in\r\ngross national product early in 1960. The Nation's output of goods and\r\nservices is now nearly 25 percent higher than in 1952.\r\n\r\nIn 1959, the average American family had an income of $6,520, 15 percent\r\nhigher in dollars of constant buying power than in 1952, and the real wages\r\nof American factory workers have risen 20 percent during the past eight\r\nyears. These facts reflect the rising standard of individual and family\r\nwell-being enjoyed by Americans.\r\n\r\nOur Nation benefits also from a remarkable improvement in general\r\nindustrial peace through strengthened processes of free collective\r\nbargaining. Time lost since 1952 because of strikes has been half that lost\r\nin the eight years prior to that date. Legislation now requires that union\r\nmembers have the opportunity for full participation in the affairs of their\r\nunions. The Administration supported the Landrum-Griffin Act, which I\r\nbelieve is greatly helpful to the vast bulk of American Labor and its\r\nleaders, and also is a major step in getting racketeers and gangsters out\r\nof labor-management affairs.\r\n\r\nThe economic security of working men and women has been strengthened by an\r\nextension of unemployment insurance coverage to 2.5 million ex-servicemen,\r\n2.4 million Federal employees, and 1.2 million employees of small\r\nbusinesses, and by a strengthening of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance\r\nAct. States have been encouraged to improve their unemployment compensation\r\nbenefits, so that today average weekly benefits are 40 percent higher than\r\nin 1953.\r\n\r\nDetermined efforts have improved workers' safety standards. Enforceable\r\nsafety standards have been established for longshoremen and ship repair\r\nworkers; Federal Safety Councils have been increased from 14 to over 100;\r\nsafety awards have been initiated, and a national construction safety\r\nprogram has been developed.\r\n\r\nA major factor in strengthening our competitive enterprise system, and\r\npromoting economic growth, has been the vigorous enforcement of antitrust\r\nlaws over the last eight years and a continuing effort to reduce artificial\r\nrestraints on competition and trade and enhance our economic liberties.\r\nThis purpose was also significantly advanced in 1953 when, as one of the\r\nfirst acts of this Administration, restrictive wage and price controls were\r\nended.\r\n\r\nAn additional measure to strengthen the American system of competitive\r\nenterprise was the creation of the Small Business Administration in 1953 to\r\nassist existing small businesses and encourage new ones. This agency has\r\napproved over $1 billion in loans, initiated a new program to provide\r\nlong-term capital for small businesses, aided in setting aside $31/2 billion\r\nin government contracts for award to small business concerns, and brought\r\nto the attention of individual businessmen, through programs of information\r\nand education, new developments in management and production techniques.\r\nSince 1952, important tax revisions have been made to encourage small\r\nbusinesses.\r\n\r\nMany major improvements in the Nation's transportation system have been\r\nmade:\r\n\r\n--After long years of debate, the dream of a great St. Lawrence Seaway,\r\nopening the heartland of America to ocean commerce, has been fulfilled.\r\n\r\n--The new Federal Aviation Agency is fostering greater safety in air\r\ntravel.\r\n\r\n--The largest public construction program in history--the 41,000 mile\r\nnational system of Interstate and Defense highways--has been pushed rapidly\r\nforward. Twenty-five percent of this system is now open to traffic.\r\n\r\nEfforts to help every American build a better life have included also a\r\nvigorous program for expanding our trade with other nations. A 4-year\r\nrenewal of the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act was passed in 1958, and a\r\ncontinuing and rewarding effort has been made to persuade other countries\r\nto remove restrictions against our exports. A new export expansion program\r\nwas launched in 1960, inaugurating improvement of export credit insurance\r\nand broadening research and information programs to awaken Americans to\r\nbusiness opportunities overseas. These actions and generally prosperous\r\nconditions abroad have helped push America's export trade to a level of $20\r\nbillion in 1960.\r\n\r\nAlthough intermittent declines in economic activity persist as a problem in\r\nour enterprise system, recent downturns have been moderate and of short\r\nduration. There is, however, little room for complacency. Currently our\r\neconomy is operating at high levels, but unemployment rates are higher than\r\nany of us would like, and chronic pockets of high unemployment persist.\r\nClearly, continued sound and broadly shared economic growth remains a major\r\nnational objective toward which we must strive through joint private and\r\npublic efforts.\r\n\r\nIf government continues to work to assure every American the fullest\r\nopportunity to develop and utilize his ability and talent, it will be\r\nperforming one of its most vital functions, that of advancing the welfare\r\nand protecting the dignity, rights, and freedom of all Americans.\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION\r\n\r\nIn January 1953, the consumer's dollar was worth only 52 cents in terms of\r\nthe food, clothing, shelter and other items it would buy compared to 1939.\r\nToday, the inflationary spiral which had raised the cost of living by 36\r\npercent between 1946 and 1952 has all but ceased and the value of the\r\ndollar virtually stabilized.\r\n\r\nIn 1954 we had the largest tax cut in history, amounting to $7.4 billion\r\nannually, of which over 62 percent went to individuals mostly in the small\r\nincome brackets.\r\n\r\nThis Administration has directed constant efforts toward fiscal\r\nresponsibility. Balanced budgets have been sought when the economy was\r\nadvancing, and a rigorous evaluation of spending programs has been\r\nmaintained at all times. Resort to deficit financing in prosperous times\r\ncould easily erode international confidence in the dollar and contribute to\r\ninflation at home. In this belief, I shall submit a balanced budget for\r\nfiscal 1962 to the Congress next week.\r\n\r\nThere has been a firm policy of reducing government competition with\r\nprivate enterprise. This has resulted in the discontinuance of some 2,000\r\ncommercial industrial installations and in addition the curtailment of\r\napproximately 550 industrial installations operated directly by government\r\nagencies.\r\n\r\nAlso an aggressive surplus disposal program has been carried on to Identify\r\nand dispose of unneeded government-owned real property. This has resulted\r\nin the addition of a substantial number of valuable properties to local tax\r\nrolls, and a significant monetary return to the government.\r\n\r\nEarnest and persistent attempts have been made to strengthen the position\r\nof State and local governments and thereby to stop the dangerous drift\r\ntoward centralization of governmental power in Washington.\r\n\r\nSignificant strides have been made in increasing the effectiveness of\r\ngovernment. Important new agencies have been established, such as the\r\nDepartment of Health, Education, and Welfare, the Federal Aviation Agency,\r\nand the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Council of\r\nEconomic Advisers was reconstituted.\r\n\r\nThe operation of our postal system has been modernized to get better and\r\nmore efficient service. Modernized handling of local mail now brings\r\nnext-day delivery to 168 million people in our population centers, expanded\r\ncarrier service now accommodates 9.3 million families in the growing\r\nsuburbs, and 1.4 million families have been added to the rural delivery\r\nservice. Common sense dictates that the Postal Service should be on a\r\nself-financing basis.\r\n\r\nThe concept of a trained and dedicated government career service has been\r\nstrengthened by the provision of life and health insurance benefits, a\r\nvastly improved retirement system, a new merit promotion program, and the\r\nfirst effective incentive awards program. With no sacrifice in efficiency,\r\nFederal civilian employment since 1953 has been reduced by over a quarter\r\nof a million persons.\r\n\r\nI am deeply gratified that it was under the urging of this Administration\r\nthat Alaska and Hawaii became our 49th and 50th States.\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURE\r\n\r\nDespite the difficulties of administering Congressional programs which\r\napply outmoded prescriptions and which aggravate rather than solve\r\nproblems, the past eight years brought notable advances in agriculture.\r\n\r\nTotal agricultural assets are approximately $200 billion--up $36 billion in\r\neight years.\r\n\r\nFarm owner equities are at the near record high of $174 billion.\r\n\r\nFarm ownership is at a record high with fewer farmers in a tenant and\r\nsharecropper status than at any time in our nation's history.\r\n\r\nThe \"Food-for-Peace\" program has demonstrated how surplus of American food\r\nand fiber can be effectively used to feed and clothe the needy abroad.\r\nAided by this humanitarian program, total agricultural exports have grown\r\nfrom $2.8 billion in 1953 to an average of about $4 billion annually for\r\nthe past three years. For 1960, exports are estimated at $4.5 billion, the\r\nhighest volume on record. Under the Food-for-Peace program, the largest\r\nwheat transaction in history was consummated with India in 1960.\r\n\r\nThe problems of low-income farm families received systematic attention for\r\nthe first time in the Rural Development Program. This program has gone\r\nforward in 39 States, yielding higher incomes and a better living for rural\r\npeople most in need.\r\n\r\nThe Rural Electrification Administration has helped meet the growing demand\r\nfor power and telephones in agricultural areas. Ninety-seven percent of all\r\nfarms now have central station electric power. Dependence upon Federal\r\nfinancing should no longer be necessary.\r\n\r\nThe Farm Credit Administration has been made an independent agency more\r\nresponsive to the farmer's needs.\r\n\r\nThe search for new uses for our farm abundance and to develop new crops for\r\ncurrent needs has made major progress. Agricultural research appropriations\r\nhave increased by 171 percent since 1953.\r\n\r\nFarmers are being saved approximately $80 million a year by the repeal in\r\n1956 of Federal taxes on gasoline used in tractors and other machinery.\r\n\r\nSince 1953, appropriations have been doubled for county agents, home agents\r\nand the Extension Service.\r\n\r\nEligibility for Social Security benefits has been extended to farmers and\r\ntheir families.\r\n\r\nYet in certain aspects our agricultural surplus situation is increasingly\r\ngrave. For example, our wheat stocks now total 1.3 billion bushels. If we\r\ndid not harvest one bushel of wheat in this coming year, we would still\r\nhave all we could eat, all we could sell abroad, all we could give away,\r\nand still have a substantial carryover. Extraordinary costs are involved\r\njust in management and disposal of this burdensome surplus. Obviously\r\nimportant adjustments must still come. Congress must enact additional\r\nlegislation to permit wheat and other farm commodities to move into regular\r\nmarketing channels in an orderly manner and at the same time afford the\r\nneeded price protection to the farmer. Only then will agriculture again be\r\nfree, sound, and profitable.\r\n\r\nNATURAL RESOURCES\r\n\r\nNew emphasis has been placed on the care of our national parks. A ten year\r\ndevelopment program of our National Park System--Mission 66--was initiated\r\nand 633,000 acres of park land have been added since 1953.\r\n\r\nAppropriations for fish and wildlife operations have more than doubled.\r\nThirty-five new refuges, containing 11,342,000 acres, have been added to\r\nthe national wildlife management system.\r\n\r\nOur Nation's forests have been improved at the most rapid rate in history.\r\n\r\nThe largest sustained effort in water resources development in our history\r\nhas taken place. In the field of reclamation alone, over 50 new projects,\r\nor project units, have been authorized since 1953--including the billion\r\ndollar Colorado River Storage Project. When all these projects have been\r\ncompleted they will have a storage capacity of nearly 43 million\r\nacre-feet--an increase of 50 percent over the Bureau of Reclamation's\r\nstorage capacity in mid-1953. In addition, since 1953 over 450 new\r\nnavigation flood control and multiple purpose projects of the Corps of\r\nEngineers have been started, costing nearly 6 billion dollars.\r\n\r\nSoil and water conservation has been advanced as never before. One hundred\r\nforty-one projects are now being constructed under the Watershed Protection\r\nProgram.\r\n\r\nHydroelectric power has been impressively developed through a policy which\r\nrecognizes that the job to be done requires comprehensive development by\r\nFederal, State, and local governments and private enterprise. Teamwork is\r\nessential to achieve this objective.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Columbia River power system has grown from two multipurpose\r\ndams with a 2.6 million kilowatt capacity to 17 multipurpose projects\r\ncompleted or under construction with an ultimate installed capacity of 8.1\r\nmillion kilowatts. After years of negotiation, a Columbia River Storage\r\nDevelopment agreement with Canada now opens the way for early realization\r\nof unparalleled power, flood control and resource conservation benefits for\r\nthe Pacific Northwest. A treaty implementing this agreement will shortly be\r\nsubmitted to the Senate.\r\n\r\nA farsighted and highly successful program for meeting urgent water needs\r\nis being carded out by converting salt water to fresh water. A 75 percent\r\nreduction in the cost of this process has already been realized.\r\n\r\nContinuous resource development is essential for our expanding economy. We\r\nmust continue vigorous, combined Federal, State and private programs, at\r\nthe same time preserving to the maximum extent possible our natural and\r\nscenic heritage for future generations.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION, SCIENCE, AND TECHNOLOGY\r\n\r\nThe National Defense Education Act of 1958 is already a milestone in the\r\nhistory of American education. It provides broad opportunities for the\r\nintellectual development of all children by strengthening courses of study\r\nin science, mathematics, and foreign languages, by developing new graduate\r\nprograms to train additional teachers, and by providing loans for young\r\npeople who need financial help to go to college.\r\n\r\nThe Administration proposed on numerous occasions a broad new five-year\r\nprogram of Federal aid to help overcome the classroom shortage in public\r\nelementary and secondary schools. Recommendations were also made to give\r\nassistance to colleges and universities for the construction of academic\r\nand residential buildings to meet future enrollment increases.\r\n\r\nThis Administration greatly expanded Federal loans for building dormitories\r\nfor students, teachers, and nurses training, a program assisting in the\r\nconstruction of approximately 200,000 living accommodations during the past\r\n8 years.\r\n\r\nThere has been a vigorous acceleration of health, resource and education\r\nprograms designed to advance the role of the American Indian in our\r\nsociety. Last fall, for example, 91 percent of the Indian children between\r\nthe ages of 6 and 18 on reservations were enrolled in school. This is a\r\nrise of 12 percent since 1953.\r\n\r\nIn the field of science and technology, startling strides have been made by\r\nthe new National Aeronautics and Space Administration. In little more than\r\ntwo years, NASA has successfully launched meteorological satellites, such\r\nas Tiros I and Tiros II, that promise to revolutionize methods of weather\r\nforecasting; demonstrated the feasibility of satellites for global\r\ncommunications by the successful launching of Echo I; produced an enormous\r\namount of valuable scientific data, such as the discovery of the Van Allen\r\nRadiation Belt; successfully launched deep-space probes that maintained\r\ncommunication over the greatest range man has ever tracked; and made real\r\nprogress toward the goal of manned space flights.\r\n\r\nThese achievements unquestionably make us preeminent today in space\r\nexploration for the betterment of mankind. I believe the present\r\norganizational arrangements in this area, with the revisions proposed last\r\nyear, are completely adequate for the tasks ahead.\r\n\r\nAmericans can look forward to new achievements in space exploration. The\r\nnear future will hold such wonders as the orbital flight of an astronaut,\r\nthe landing of instruments on the moon, the launching of the powerful giant\r\nSaturn rocket vehicles, and the reconnaissance of Mars and Venus by\r\nunmanned vehicles.\r\n\r\nThe application of atomic energy to industry, agriculture, and medicine has\r\nprogressed from hope and experiment to reality. American industry and\r\nagriculture are making increasing use of radioisotopes to improve\r\nmanufacturing, testing, and crop-raising. Atomic energy has improved the\r\nability of the healing professions to combat disease, and holds promise for\r\nan eventual increase in man's life span.\r\n\r\nEducation, science, technology and balanced programs of every kind-these\r\nare the roadways to progress. With appropriate Federal support, the States\r\nand localities can assure opportunities for achieving excellence at all\r\nlevels of the educational system; and with the Federal government\r\ncontinuing to give wholehearted support to basic scientific research and\r\ntechnology, we can expect to maintain our position of leadership in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nCIVIL RIGHTS\r\n\r\nThe first consequential Federal Civil Rights legislation in 85 years was\r\nenacted by Congress on recommendation of the Administration in 1957 and\r\n1960.\r\n\r\nA new Civil Rights Division in the Department of Justice has already moved\r\nto enforce constitutional rights in such areas as voting and the\r\nelimination of Jim Crow laws.\r\n\r\nGreater equality of job opportunity in Federal employment and employment\r\nwith Federal contractors has been effectively provided through the\r\nPresident's Committees on Government Contracts and Government Employment\r\nPractices.\r\n\r\nThe Civil Rights Commission has undertaken important surveys in the fields\r\nof housing, voting, and education.\r\n\r\nSegregation has been abolished in the Armed Forces, in Veterans' Hospitals,\r\nin all Federal employment, and throughout the District of\r\nColumbia--administratively accomplished progress in this field that is\r\nunmatched in America's recent history.\r\n\r\nThis pioneering work in civil rights must go on. Not only because\r\ndiscrimination is morally wrong, but also because its impact is more than\r\nnational--it is world-wide.\r\n\r\nHEALTH AND WELFARE\r\n\r\nFederal medical research expenditures have increased more than fourfold\r\nsince 1954.\r\n\r\nA vast variety of the approaches known to medical science has been explored\r\nto find better methods of treatment and prevention of major diseases,\r\nparticularly heart diseases, cancer, and mental illness.\r\n\r\nThe control of air and water pollution has been greatly strengthened.\r\n\r\nAmericans now have greater protection against harmful, unclean, or\r\nmisrepresented foods, drugs, or cosmetics through a strengthened Food and\r\nDrug Administration and by new legislation which requires that food\r\nadditives be proved safe for human consumption before use.\r\n\r\nA newly established Federal Radiation Council, along with the Department of\r\nHealth, Education, and Welfare, analyzes and coordinates information\r\nregarding radiological activities which affect the public health.\r\n\r\nMedical manpower has been increased by Federal grants for teaching and\r\nresearch.\r\n\r\nConstruction of new medical facilities has been stepped up and extended to\r\ninclude nursing homes, diagnostic and treatment centers, and rehabilitation\r\nfacilities.\r\n\r\nThe vocational rehabilitation program has been significantly expanded.\r\nAbout 90,000 handicapped people are now being rehabilitated annually so\r\nthey are again able to earn their own living with self-respect and\r\ndignity.\r\n\r\nNew legislation provides for better medical care for the needy aged,\r\nincluding those older persons, who, while otherwise self-sufficient, need\r\nhelp in meeting their health care costs. The Administration recommended a\r\nmajor expansion of this effort.\r\n\r\nThe coverage of the Social Security Act has been broadened since 1953 to\r\nmake 11 million additional people eligible for retirement, disability or\r\nsurvivor benefits for themselves or their dependents, and the Social\r\nSecurity benefits have been substantially improved.\r\n\r\nGrants to the States for maternal and child welfare services have been\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nThe States, aided by Federal grants, now assist some 6 million needy people\r\nthrough the programs of Old Age Assistance, Aid to Dependent Children, Aid\r\nto the Blind, and Aid to the Totally and Permanently Disabled.\r\n\r\nHOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT\r\n\r\nMore houses have been built during the past eight years--over nine\r\nmillion--than during any previous eight years in history.\r\n\r\nAn historic new approach--Urban Renewal--now replaces piecemeal thrusts at\r\nslum pockets and urban blight. Communities engaged in urban renewal have\r\ndoubled and renewal projects have more than tripled since 1953. An\r\nestimated 68 projects in 50 cities will be completed by the end of the\r\ncurrent fiscal year; another 577 projects will be underway, and planning\r\nfor 310 more will be in process. A total of $2 billion in Federal grants\r\nwill ultimately be required to finance these 955 projects.\r\n\r\nNew programs have been initiated to provide more and better housing for\r\nelderly people. Approximately 25,000 units especially designed for the\r\nelderly have been built, started, or approved in the past three years.\r\n\r\nFor the first time, because of Federal help and .encouragement, 90\r\nmetropolitan areas and urban regions and 1140 smaller towns throughout the\r\ncountry are making comprehensive development plans for their future growth\r\nand development.\r\n\r\nAmerican communities have been helped to plan water and sanitation systems\r\nand schools through planning advances for 1600 public works projects with a\r\nconstruction cost of nearly $2 billion.\r\n\r\nMortgage insurance on individual homes has been greatly expanded. During\r\nthe past eight years, the Federal Housing Administration alone insured over\r\n21/2 million home mortgages valued at $27 billion, and in addition, insured\r\nmore than ten million property improvement loans.\r\n\r\nThe Federal government must continue to provide leadership in order to make\r\nour cities and communities better places in which to live, work, and raise\r\nfamilies, but without usurping rightful local authority, replacing\r\nindividual responsibility, or stifling private initiative.\r\n\r\nIMMIGRATION\r\n\r\nOver 32,000 victims of Communist tyranny in Hungary were brought to our\r\nshores, and at this time our country is working to assist refugees from\r\ntyranny in Cuba.\r\n\r\nSince 1953, the waiting period for naturalization applicants has been\r\nreduced from 18 months to 45 days.\r\n\r\nThe Administration also has made legislative recommendations to liberalize\r\nexisting restrictions upon immigration while still safeguarding the\r\nnational interest. It is imperative that our immigration policy be in the\r\nfinest American tradition of providing a haven for oppressed peoples and\r\nfully in accord with our obligation as a leader of the free world.\r\n\r\nVETERANS\r\n\r\nIn discharging the nation's obligation to our veterans, during the past\r\neight years there have been:\r\n\r\nThe readjustment of World War II veterans was completed, and the five\r\nmillion Korean conflict veterans were assisted in achieving successful\r\nreadjustment to civilian life;\r\n\r\nIncreases in compensation benefits for all eligible veterans with service\r\nconnected disabilities;\r\n\r\nHigher non-service connected pension benefits for needy veterans;\r\n\r\nGreatly improved benefits to survivors of veterans dying in or as a result\r\nof service;\r\n\r\nAuthorization, by Presidential directive, of an increase in the number of\r\nbeds available for sick and disabled veterans;\r\n\r\nDevelopment of a 12-year, $900 million construction program to modernize\r\nand improve our veterans hospitals;\r\n\r\nNew modern techniques brought into the administration of Veterans Affairs\r\nto provide the highest quality service possible to those who have defended\r\nus.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nIn concluding my final message to the Congress, it is fitting to look back\r\nto my first--to the aims and ideals I set forth on February 2, 1953: To use\r\nAmerica's influence in world affairs to advance the cause of peace and\r\njustice, to conduct the affairs of the Executive Branch with integrity and\r\nefficiency, to encourage creative initiative in our economy, and to work\r\ntoward the attainment of the well-being and equality of opportunity of all\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nEqually, we have honored our commitment to pursue and attain specific\r\nobjectives. Among them, as stated eight years ago: strengthening of the\r\nmutual security program; development of world trade and commerce; ending of\r\nhostilities in Korea; creation of a powerful deterrent force; practicing\r\nfiscal responsibility; checking the menace of inflation; reducing the tax\r\nburden; providing an effective internal security program; developing and\r\nconserving our natural resources; reducing governmental interference in the\r\naffairs of the farmer; strengthening and improving services by the\r\nDepartment of Labor, and the vigilant guarding of civil and social fights.\r\n\r\nI do not close this message implying that all is well--that all problems\r\nare solved. For progress implies both new and continuing problems and,\r\nunlike Presidential administrations, problems rarely have terminal dates.\r\n\r\nAbroad, there is the continuing Communist threat to the freedom of Berlin,\r\nan explosive situation in Laos, the problems caused by Communist\r\npenetration of Cuba, as well as the many problems connected with the\r\ndevelopment of the new nations in Africa. These areas, in particular, call\r\nfor delicate handling and constant review.\r\n\r\nAt home, several conspicuous problems remain: promoting higher levels of\r\nemployment, with special emphasis on areas in which heavy unemployment has\r\npersisted; continuing to provide for steady economic growth and preserving\r\na sound currency; bringing our balance of payments into more reasonable\r\nequilibrium and continuing a high level of confidence in our national and\r\ninternational systems; eliminating heavily excessive surpluses of a few\r\nfarm commodities; and overcoming deficiencies in our health and educational\r\nprograms.\r\n\r\nOur goal always has been to add to the spiritual, moral, and material\r\nstrength of our nation. I believe we have done this. But it is a process\r\nthat must never end. Let us pray that leaders of both the near and distant\r\nfuture will be able to keep the nation strong and at peace, that they will\r\nadvance the well-being of all our people, that they will lead us on to\r\nstill higher moral standards, and that, in achieving these goals, they will\r\nmaintain a reasonable balance between private and governmental\r\nresponsibility.",
