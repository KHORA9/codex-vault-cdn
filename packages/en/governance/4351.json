I.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a great difficulty in the way of a writer who attempts to\r\nsketch a living Constitution--a Constitution that is in actual work and\r\npower. The difficulty is that the object is in constant change. An\r\nhistorical writer does not feel this difficulty: he deals only with the\r\npast; he can say definitely, the Constitution worked in such and such a\r\nmanner in the year at which he begins, and in a manner in such and such\r\nrespects different in the year at which he ends; he begins with a\r\ndefinite point of time and ends with one also. But a contemporary\r\nwriter who tries to paint what is before him is puzzled and a\r\nperplexed: what he sees is changing daily. He must paint it as it stood\r\nat some one time, or else he will be putting side by side in his\r\nrepresentations things which never were contemporaneous in reality. The\r\ndifficulty is the greater because a writer who deals with a living\r\nGovernment naturally compares it with the most important other living\r\nGovernments, and these are changing too; what he illustrates are\r\naltered in one way, and his sources of illustration are altered\r\nprobably in a different way. This difficulty has been constantly in my\r\nway in preparing a second edition of this book. It describes the\r\nEnglish Constitution as it stood in the years 1865 and 1866. Roughly\r\nspeaking, it describes its working as it was in the time of Lord\r\nPalmerston; and since that time there have been many changes, some of\r\nspirit and some of detail. In so short a period there have rarely been\r\nmore changes. If I had given a sketch of the Palmerston time as a\r\nsketch of the present time, it would have been in many points untrue;\r\nand if I had tried to change the sketch of seven years since into a\r\nsketch of the present time, I should probably have blurred the picture\r\nand have given something equally unlike both.\r\n\r\nThe best plan in such a case is, I think, to keep the original sketch\r\nin all essentials as it was at first written, and to describe shortly\r\nsuch changes either in the Constitution itself, or in the Constitutions\r\ncompared with it, as seem material. There are in this book various\r\nexpressions which allude to persons who were living and to events which\r\nwere happening when it first appeared; and I have carefully preserved\r\nthese. They will serve to warn the reader what time he is reading\r\nabout, and to prevent his mistaking the date at which the likeness was\r\nattempted to be taken. I proceed to speak of the changes which have\r\ntaken place either in the Constitution itself or in the competing\r\ninstitutions which illustrate it.\r\n\r\nIt is too soon as yet to attempt to estimate the effect of the Reform\r\nAct of 1867. The people enfranchised under it do not yet know their\r\nown power; a single election, so far from teaching us how they will use\r\nthat power, has not been even enough to explain to them that they have\r\nsuch power. The Reform Act of 1832 did not for many years disclose its\r\nreal consequences; a writer in 1836, whether he approved or disapproved\r\nof them, whether he thought too little of or whether he exaggerated\r\nthem, would have been sure to be mistaken in them. A new Constitution\r\ndoes not produce its full effect as long as all its subjects were\r\nreared under an old Constitution, as long as its statesmen were trained\r\nby that old Constitution. It is not really tested till it comes to be\r\nworked by statesmen and among a people neither of whom are guided by a\r\ndifferent experience.\r\n\r\nIn one respect we are indeed particularly likely to be mistaken as to\r\nthe effect of the last Reform Bill. Undeniably there has lately been a\r\ngreat change in our politics. It is commonly said that \"there is not a\r\nbrick of the Palmerston House standing\". The change since 1865 is a\r\nchange not in one point but in a thousand points; it is a change not of\r\nparticular details but of pervading spirit. We are now quarrelling as\r\nto the minor details of an Education Act; in Lord Palmerston's time no\r\nsuch Act could have passed. In Lord Palmerston's time Sir George Grey\r\nsaid that the disestablishment of the Irish Church would be an \"act of\r\nRevolution\"; it has now been disestablished by great majorities, with\r\nSir George Grey himself assenting. A new world has arisen which is not\r\nas the old world; and we naturally ascribe the change to the Reform\r\nAct. But this is a complete mistake. If there had been no Reform Act at\r\nall there would, nevertheless, have been a great change in English\r\npolitics. There has been a change of the sort which, above all,\r\ngenerates other changes--a change of generation. Generally one\r\ngeneration in politics succeeds another almost silently; at every\r\nmoment men of all ages between thirty and seventy have considerable\r\ninfluence; each year removes many old men, makes all others older,\r\nbrings in many new. The transition is so gradual that we hardly\r\nperceive it. The board of directors of the political company has a few\r\nslight changes every year, and therefore the shareholders are conscious\r\nof no abrupt change. But sometimes there IS an abrupt change. It\r\noccasionally happens that several ruling directors who are about the\r\nsame age live on for many years, manage the company all through those\r\nyears, and then go off the scene almost together. In that case the\r\naffairs of the company are apt to alter much, for good or for evil;\r\nsometimes it becomes more successful, sometimes it is ruined, but it\r\nhardly ever stays as it was. Something like this happened before 1865.\r\nAll through the period between 1832 and 1865, the pre-'32 statesmen--if\r\nI may so call them--Lord Derby, Lord Russell, Lord Palmerston, retained\r\ngreat power. Lord Palmerston to the last retained great prohibitive\r\npower. Though in some ways always young, he had not a particle of\r\nsympathy with the younger generation; he brought forward no young men;\r\nhe obstructed all that young men wished. In consequence, at his death a\r\nnew generation all at once started into life; the pre-'32 all at once\r\ndied out. Most of the new politicians were men who might well have been\r\nLord Palmerston's grandchildren. He came into Parliament in 1806, they\r\nentered it after 1856. Such an enormous change in the age of the\r\nworkers necessarily caused a great change in the kind of work attempted\r\nand the way in which it was done. What we call the \"spirit\" of politics\r\nis more surely changed by a change of generation in the men than by any\r\nother change whatever. Even if there had been no Reform Act, this\r\nsingle cause would have effected grave alterations.\r\n\r\nThe mere settlement of the Reform question made a great change too. If\r\nit could have been settled by any other change, or even without any\r\nchange, the instant effect of the settlement would still have been\r\nimmense. New questions would have appeared at once. A political country\r\nis like an American forest; you have only to cut down the old trees,\r\nand immediately new trees come up to replace them; the seeds were\r\nwaiting in the ground, and they began to grow as soon as the withdrawal\r\nof the old ones brought in light and air. These new questions of\r\nthemselves would have made a new atmosphere, new parties, new debates.\r\n\r\nOf course I am not arguing that so important an innovation as the\r\nReform Act of 1867 will not have very great effects. It must, in all\r\nlikelihood, have many great ones. I am only saying that as yet we do\r\nnot know what those effects are; that the great evident change since\r\n1865 is certainly not strictly due to it; probably is not even in a\r\nprincipal measure due to it; that we have still to conjecture what it\r\nwill cause and what it will not cause.\r\n\r\nThe principal question arises most naturally from a main doctrine of\r\nthese essays. I have said that Cabinet government is possible in\r\nEngland because England was a deferential country. I meant that the\r\nnominal constituency was not the real constituency; that the mass of\r\nthe \"ten-pound\" house-holders did not really form their own opinions,\r\nand did not exact of their representatives an obedience to those\r\nopinions; that they were in fact guided in their judgment by the better\r\neducated classes; that they preferred representatives from those\r\nclasses, and gave those representatives much licence. If a hundred\r\nsmall shopkeepers had by miracle been added to any of the '32\r\nParliaments, they would have felt outcasts there. Nothing could be more\r\nunlike those Parliaments than the average mass of the constituency from\r\nwhich they were chosen.\r\n\r\nI do not of course mean that the ten-pound householders were great\r\nadmirers of intellect or good judges of refinement. We all know that,\r\nfor the most part, they were not so at all; very few Englishmen are.\r\nThey were not influenced by ideas, but by facts; not by things\r\nimpalpable, but by things palpable. Not to put too fine a point upon\r\nit, they were influenced by rank and wealth. No doubt the better sort\r\nof them believed that those who were superior to them in these\r\nindisputable respects were superior also in the more intangible\r\nqualities of sense and knowledge. But the mass of the old electors did\r\nnot analyse very much: they liked to have one of their \"betters\" to\r\nrepresent them; if he was rich they respected him much; and if he was a\r\nlord, they liked him the better. The issue put before these electors\r\nwas, Which of two rich people will you choose? And each of those rich\r\npeople was put forward by great parties whose notions were the notions\r\nof the rich--whose plans were their plans. The electors only selected\r\none or two wealthy men to carry out the schemes of one or two wealthy\r\nassociations.\r\n\r\nSo fully was this so, that the class to whom the great body of the\r\nten-pound householders belonged--the lower middle class--was above all\r\nclasses the one most hardly treated in the imposition of the taxes. A\r\nsmall shopkeeper, or a clerk who just, and only just, was rich enough\r\nto pay income tax, was perhaps the only severely taxed man in the\r\ncountry. He paid the rates, the tea, sugar, tobacco, malt, and spirit\r\ntaxes, as well as the income tax, but his means were exceedingly small.\r\nCuriously enough the class which in theory was omnipotent, was the only\r\nclass financially ill-treated. Throughout the history of our former\r\nParliaments the constituency could no more have originated the policy\r\nwhich those Parliaments selected than they could have made the solar\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nAs I have endeavoured to show in this volume, the deference of the old\r\nelectors to their betters was the only way in which our old system\r\ncould be maintained. No doubt countries can be imagined in which the\r\nmass of the electors would be thoroughly competent to form good\r\nopinions; approximations to that state happily exist. But such was not\r\nthe state of the minor English shopkeepers. They were just competent to\r\nmake a selection between two sets of superior ideas; or rather--for the\r\nconceptions of such people are more personal than abstract--between two\r\nopposing parties, each professing a creed of such ideas. But they could\r\ndo no more. Their own notions, if they had been cross-examined upon\r\nthem, would have been found always most confused and often most\r\nfoolish. They were competent to decide an issue selected by the higher\r\nclasses, but they were incompetent to do more.\r\n\r\nThe grave question now is, How far will this peculiar old system\r\ncontinue and how far will it be altered? I am afraid I must put aside\r\nat once the idea that it will be altered entirely and altered for the\r\nbetter. I cannot expect that the new class of voters will be at all\r\nmore able to form sound opinions on complex questions than the old\r\nvoters. There was indeed an idea--a very prevalent idea when the first\r\nedition of this book was published--that there then was an\r\nunrepresented class of skilled artisans who could form superior\r\nopinions on national matters, and ought to have the means of expressing\r\nthem. We used to frame elaborate schemes to give them such means. But\r\nthe Reform Act of 1867 did not stop at skilled labour; it enfranchised\r\nunskilled labour too. And no one will contend that the ordinary working\r\nman who has no special skill, and who is only rated because he has a\r\nhouse, can judge much of intellectual matters. The messenger in an\r\noffice is not more intelligent than the clerks, not better educated,\r\nbut worse; and yet the messenger is probably a very superior specimen\r\nof the newly enfranchised classes. The average can only earn very\r\nscanty wages by coarse labour. They have no time to improve themselves,\r\nfor they are labouring the whole day through; and their early education\r\nwas so small that in most cases it is dubious whether even if they had\r\nmuch time, they could use it to good purpose. We have not enfranchised\r\na class less needing to be guided by their betters than the old class;\r\non the contrary, the new class need it more than the old. The real\r\nquestion is, Will they submit to it, will they defer in the same way to\r\nwealth and rank, and to the higher qualities of which these are the\r\nrough symbols and the common accompaniments?\r\n\r\nThere is a peculiar difficulty in answering this question. Generally,\r\nthe debates upon the passing of an Act contain much valuable\r\ninstruction as to what may be expected of it. But the debates on the\r\nReform Act of 1867 hardly tell anything. They are taken up with\r\ntechnicalities as to the ratepayers and the compound householder.\r\nNobody in the country knew what was being done. I happened at the time\r\nto visit a purely agricultural and Conservative county, and I asked the\r\nlocal Tories, \"Do you understand this Reform Bill? Do you know that\r\nyour Conservative Government has brought in a Bill far more Radical\r\nthan any former Bill, and that it is very likely to be passed?\" The\r\nanswer I got was, \"What stuff you talk! How can it be a Radical Reform\r\nBill? Why, BRIGHT opposes it!\" There was no answering that in a way\r\nwhich a \"common jury\" could understand. The Bill was supported by the\r\nTimes and opposed by Mr. Bright; and therefore the mass of the\r\nConservatives and of common moderate people, without distinction of\r\nparty, had no conception of the effect. They said it was \"London\r\nnonsense\" if you tried to explain it to them. The nation indeed\r\ngenerally looks to the discussions in Parliament to enlighten it as to\r\nthe effect of Bills. But in this case neither party, as a party, could\r\nspeak out. Many, perhaps most of the intelligent Conservatives, were\r\nfearful of the consequences of the proposal; but as it was made by the\r\nheads of their own party, they did not like to oppose it, and the\r\ndiscipline of party carried them with it. On the other side, many,\r\nprobably most of the intelligent Liberals, were in consternation at the\r\nBill; they had been in the habit for years of proposing Reform Bills;\r\nthey knew the points of difference between each Bill, and perceived\r\nthat this was by far the most sweeping which had ever been proposed by\r\nany Ministry. But they were almost all unwilling to say so. They would\r\nhave offended a large section in their constituencies if they had\r\nresisted a Tory Bill because it was too democratic; the extreme\r\npartisans of democracy would have said, \"The enemies of the people have\r\nconfidence enough in the people to entrust them with this power, but\r\nyou, a 'Liberal,' and a professed friend of the people, have not that\r\nconfidence; if that is so, we will never vote for you again\". Many\r\nRadical members who had been asking for years for household suffrage\r\nwere much more surprised than pleased at the near chance of obtaining\r\nit; they had asked for it as bargainers ask for the highest possible\r\nprice, but they never expected to get it. Altogether the Liberals, or\r\nat least the extreme Liberals, were much like a man who has been\r\npushing hard against an opposing door, till, on a sudden, the door\r\nopens, the resistance ceases, and he is thrown violently forward.\r\nPersons in such an unpleasant predicament can scarcely criticise\r\neffectually, and certainly the Liberals did not so criticise. We have\r\nhad no such previous discussions as should guide our expectations from\r\nthe Reform Bill, nor such as under ordinary circumstances we should\r\nhave had.\r\n\r\nNor does the experience of the last election much help us. The\r\ncircumstances were too exceptional. In the first place, Mr. Gladstone's\r\npersonal popularity was such as has not been seen since the time of Mr.\r\nPitt, and such as may never be seen again. Certainly it will very\r\nrarely be seen. A bad speaker is said to have been asked how he got on\r\nas a candidate. \"Oh,\" he answered, \"when I do not know what to say, I\r\nsay 'Gladstone,' and then they are sure to cheer, and I have time to\r\nthink.\" In fact, that popularity acted as a guide both to\r\nconstituencies and to members. The candidates only said they would vote\r\nwith Mr. Gladstone, and the constituencies only chose those who said\r\nso. Even the minority could only be described as anti-Gladstone, just\r\nas the majority could only be described as pro-Gladstone. The remains,\r\ntoo, of the old electoral organisation were exceedingly powerful; the\r\nold voters voted as they had been told, and the new voters mostly voted\r\nwith them. In extremely few cases was there any new and contrary\r\norganisation. At the last election, the trial of the new system hardly\r\nbegan, and, as far as it did begin, it was favoured by a peculiar\r\nguidance.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime our statesmen have the greatest opportunities they have\r\nhad for many years, and likewise the greatest duty. They have to guide\r\nthe new voters in the exercise of the franchise; to guide them quietly,\r\nand without saying what they are doing, but still to guide them. The\r\nleading statesmen in a free country have great momentary power. They\r\nsettle the conversation of mankind. It is they who, by a great speech\r\nor two, determine what shall be said and what shall be written for long\r\nafter. They, in conjunction with their counsellors, settle the\r\nprogramme of their party--the \"platform,\" as the Americans call it, on\r\nwhich they and those associated with them are to take their stand for\r\nthe political campaign. It is by that programme, by a comparison of the\r\nprogrammes of different statesmen, that the world forms its judgment.\r\nThe common ordinary mind is quite unfit to fix for itself what\r\npolitical question it shall attend to; it is as much as it can do to\r\njudge decently of the questions which drift down to it, and are brought\r\nbefore it; it almost never settles its topics; it can only decide upon\r\nthe issues of those topics. And in settling what these questions shall\r\nbe, statesmen have now especially a great responsibility if they raise\r\nquestions which will excite the lower orders of mankind; if they raise\r\nquestions on which those orders are likely to be wrong; if they raise\r\nquestions on which the interest of those orders is not identical with,\r\nor is antagonistic to, the whole interest of the State, they will have\r\ndone the greatest harm they can do. The future of this country depends\r\non the happy working of a delicate experiment, and they will have done\r\nall they could to vitiate that experiment. Just when it is desirable\r\nthat ignorant men, new to politics, should have good issues, and only\r\ngood issues, put before them, these statesmen will have suggested bad\r\nissues. They will have suggested topics which will bind the poor as a\r\nclass together; topics which will excite them against the rich; topics\r\nthe discussion of which in the only form in which that discussion\r\nreaches their ear will be to make them think that some new law can make\r\nthem comfortable--that it is the present law which makes them\r\nuncomfortable--that Government has at its disposal an inexhaustible\r\nfund out of which it can give to those who now want without also\r\ncreating elsewhere other and greater wants. If the first work of the\r\npoor voters is to try to create a \"poor man's paradise,\" as poor men\r\nare apt to fancy that Paradise, and as they are apt to think they can\r\ncreate it, the great political trial now beginning will simply fail.\r\nThe wide gift of the elective franchise will be a great calamity to the\r\nwhole nation, and to those who gain it as great a calamity as to any.\r\n\r\nI do not of course mean that statesmen can choose with absolute freedom\r\nwhat topics they will deal with and what they will not. I am of course\r\naware that they choose under stringent conditions. In excited states of\r\nthe public mind they have scarcely a discretion at all; the tendency of\r\nthe public perturbation determines what shall and what shall not be\r\ndealt with. But, upon the other hand, in quiet times statesmen have\r\ngreat power; when there is no fire lighted, they can settle what fire\r\nshall be lit. And as the new suffrage is happily to be tried in a quiet\r\ntime, the responsibility of our statesmen is great because their power\r\nis great too.\r\n\r\nAnd the mode in which the questions dealt with are discussed is almost\r\nas important as the selection of these questions. It is for our\r\nprincipal statesmen to lead the public, and not to let the public lead\r\nthem. No doubt when statesmen live by public favour, as ours do, this\r\nis a hard saying, and it requires to be carefully limited. I do not\r\nmean that our statesmen should assume a pedantic and doctrinaire tone\r\nwith the English people; if there is anything which English people\r\nthoroughly detest, it is that tone exactly. And they are right in\r\ndetesting it; if a man cannot give guidance and communicate instruction\r\nformally without telling his audience \"I am better than you; I have\r\nstudied this as you have not,\" then he is not fit for a guide or an\r\ninstructor. A statesman who should show that gaucherie would exhibit a\r\ndefect of imagination, and expose an incapacity for dealing with men\r\nwhich would be a great hindrance to him in his calling. But much\r\nargument is not required to guide the public, still less a formal\r\nexposition of that argument. What is mostly needed is the manly\r\nutterance of clear conclusions; if a statesman gives these in a\r\nfelicitous way (and if with a few light and humorous illustrations, so\r\nmuch the better), he has done his part. He will have given the text,\r\nthe scribes in the newspapers will write the sermon. A statesman ought\r\nto show his own nature, and talk in a palpable way what is to him\r\nimportant truth. And so he will both guide and benefit the nation. But\r\nif, especially at a time when great ignorance has an unusual power in\r\npublic affairs, he chooses to accept and reiterate the decisions of\r\nthat ignorance, he is only the hireling of the nation, and does little\r\nsave hurt it.\r\n\r\nI shall be told that this is very obvious, and that everybody knows\r\nthat 2 and 2 make 4, and that there is no use in inculcating it. But I\r\nanswer that the lesson is not observed in fact; people do not so do\r\ntheir political sums. Of all our political dangers, the greatest I\r\nconceive is that they will neglect the lesson. In plain English, what I\r\nfear is that both our political parties will bid for the support of the\r\nworking man; that both of them will promise to do as he likes if he\r\nwill only tell them what it is; that, as he now holds the casting vote\r\nin our affairs, both parties will beg and pray him to give that vote to\r\nthem. I can conceive of nothing more corrupting or worse for a set of\r\npoor ignorant people than that two combinations of well-taught and rich\r\nmen should constantly offer to defer to their decision, and compete for\r\nthe office of executing it. Vox populi will be Vox diaboli if it is\r\nworked in that manner.\r\n\r\nAnd, on the other hand, my imagination conjures up a contrary danger. I\r\ncan conceive that questions BEING raised which, if continually\r\nagitated, would combine the working men as a class together, the higher\r\norders might have to consider whether they would concede the measure\r\nthat would settle such questions, or whether they would risk the effect\r\nof the working men's combination.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the question cannot be easily discussed in the abstract; much\r\nmust depend on the nature of the measures in each particular case; on\r\nthe evil they would cause if conceded; on the attractiveness of their\r\nidea to the working classes if refused. But in all cases it must be\r\nremembered that a political combination of the lower classes, as such\r\nand for their own objects, is an evil of the first magnitude; that a\r\npermanent combination of them would make them (now that so many of them\r\nhave the suffrage) supreme in the country; and that their supremacy, in\r\nthe state they now are, means the supremacy of ignorance over\r\ninstruction and of numbers over knowledge. So long as they are not\r\ntaught to act together, there is a chance of this being averted, and it\r\ncan only be averted by the greatest wisdom and the greatest foresight\r\nin the higher classes. They must avoid, not only every evil, but every\r\nappearance of evil; while they have still the power they must remove,\r\nnot only every actual grievance, but, where it is possible, every\r\nseeming grievance too; they must willingly concede every claim which\r\nthey can safely concede, in order that they may not have to concede\r\nunwillingly some claim which would impair the safety of the country.\r\n\r\nThis advice, too, will be said to be obvious; but I have the greatest\r\nfear that, when the time comes, it will be cast aside as timid and\r\ncowardly. So strong are the combative propensities of man that he would\r\nrather fight a losing battle than not fight at all. It is most\r\ndifficult to persuade people that by fighting they may strengthen the\r\nenemy, yet that would be so here; since a losing battle--especially a\r\nlong and well-fought one--would have thoroughly taught the lower orders\r\nto combine, and would have left the higher orders face to face with an\r\nirritated, organised, and superior voting power. The courage which\r\nstrengthens an enemy and which so loses, not only the present battle,\r\nbut many after battles, is a heavy curse to men and nations.\r\n\r\nIn one minor respect, indeed, I think we may see with distinctness the\r\neffect of the Reform Bill of 1867. I think it has completed one change\r\nwhich the Act of 1832 began; it has completed the change which that Act\r\nmade in the relation of the House of Lords to the House of Commons. As\r\nI have endeavoured in this book to explain, the literary theory of the\r\nEnglish Constitution is on this point quite wrong as usual. According\r\nto that theory, the two Houses are two branches of the legislature,\r\nperfectly equal and perfectly distinct. But before the Act of 1832 they\r\nwere not so distinct; there was a very large and a very strong common\r\nelement. By their commanding influence in many boroughs and counties\r\nthe Lords nominated a considerable part of the Commons; the majority of\r\nthe other part were the richer gentry--men in most respects like the\r\nLords, and sympathising with the Lords. Under the Constitution as it\r\nthen was the two Houses were not in their essence distinct; they were\r\nin their essence similar; they were, in the main, not Houses of\r\ncontrasted origin, but Houses of like origin. The predominant part of\r\nboth was taken from the same class--from the English gentry, titled and\r\nuntitled. By the Act of 1832 this was much altered. The aristocracy and\r\nthe gentry lost their predominance in the House of Commons; that\r\npredominance passed to the middle class. The two Houses then became\r\ndistinct, but then they ceased to be co-equal. The Duke of Wellington,\r\nin a most remarkable paper, has explained what pains he took to induce\r\nthe Lords to submit to their new position, and to submit, time after\r\ntime, their will to the will of the Commons.\r\n\r\nThe Reform Act of 1867 has, I think, unmistakably completed the effect\r\nwhich the Act of 1832 began, but left unfinished. The middle class\r\nelement has gained greatly by the second change, and the aristocratic\r\nelement has lost greatly. If you examine carefully the lists of\r\nmembers, especially of the most prominent members, of either side of\r\nthe House, you will not find that they are in general aristocratic\r\nnames. Considering the power and position of the titled aristocracy,\r\nyou will perhaps be astonished at the small degree in which it\r\ncontributes to the active part of our governing assembly. The spirit of\r\nour present House of Commons is plutocratic, not aristocratic; its most\r\nprominent statesmen are not men of ancient descent or of great\r\nhereditary estate; they are men mostly of substantial means, but they\r\nare mostly, too, connected more or less closely with the new trading\r\nwealth. The spirit of the two Assemblies has become far more contrasted\r\nthan it ever was.\r\n\r\nThe full effect of the Reform Act of 1832 was indeed postponed by the\r\ncause which I mentioned just now. The statesmen who worked the system\r\nwhich was put up had themselves been educated under the system which\r\nwas pulled down. Strangely enough, their predominant guidance lasted as\r\nlong as the system which they created. Lord Palmerston, Lord Russell,\r\nLord Derby, died or else lost their influence within a year or two of\r\n1867. The complete consequences of the Act of 1832 upon the House of\r\nLords could not be seen while the Commons were subject to such\r\naristocratic guidance. Much of the change which might have been\r\nexpected from the Act of 1832 was held in suspense, and did not begin\r\ntill that measure had been followed by another of similar and greater\r\npower.\r\n\r\nThe work which the Duke of Wellington in part performed has now,\r\ntherefore, to be completed also. He met the half difficulty; we have to\r\nsurmount the whole one. We have to frame such tacit rules, to establish\r\nsuch ruling but unenacted customs, as will make the House of Lords\r\nyield to the Commons when and as often as our new Constitution requires\r\nthat it should yield. I shall be asked, How often is that, and what is\r\nthe test by which you know it? I answer that the House of Lords must\r\nyield whenever the opinion of the Commons is also the opinion of the\r\nnation, and when it is clear that the nation has made up its mind.\r\nWhether or not the nation has made up its mind is a question to be\r\ndecided by all the circumstances of the case, and in the common way in\r\nwhich all practical questions are decided. There are some people who\r\nlay down a sort of mechanical test; they say the House of Lords should\r\nbe at liberty to reject a measure passed by the Commons once or more,\r\nand then if the Commons send it up again and again, infer that the\r\nnation is determined. But no important practical question in real life\r\ncan be uniformly settled by a fixed and formal rule in this way. This\r\nrule would prove that the Lords might have rejected the Reform Act of\r\n1832. Whenever the nation was both excited and determined, such a rule\r\nwould be an acute and dangerous political poison. It would teach the\r\nHouse of Lords that it might shut its eyes to all the facts of real\r\nlife and decide simply by an abstract formula. If in 1832 the Lords had\r\nso acted, there would have been a revolution. Undoubtedly there is a\r\ngeneral truth in the rule. Whether a bill has come up once only, or\r\nwhether it has come up several times, is one important fact in judging\r\nwhether the nation is determined to have that measure enacted; it is an\r\nindication, but it is only one of the indications. There are others\r\nequally decisive. The unanimous voice of the people may be so strong,\r\nand may be conveyed through so many organs, that it may be assumed to\r\nbe lasting.\r\n\r\nEnglishmen are so very miscellaneous, that that which has REALLY\r\nconvinced a great and varied majority of them for the present may\r\nfairly be assumed to be likely to continue permanently to convince\r\nthem. One sort might easily fall into a temporary and erroneous\r\nfanaticism, but all sorts simultaneously are very unlikely to do so.\r\n\r\nI should venture so far as to lay down for an approximate rule, that\r\nthe House of Lords ought, on a first-class subject, to be slow--very\r\nslow--in rejecting a Bill passed even once by a large majority of the\r\nHouse of Commons. I would not of course lay this down as an unvarying\r\nrule; as I have said, I have for practical purposes no belief in\r\nunvarying rules. Majorities may be either genuine or fictitious, and if\r\nthey are not genuine, if they do not embody the opinion of the\r\nrepresentative as well as the opinion of the constituency, no one would\r\nwish to have any attention paid to them. But if the opinion of the\r\nnation be strong and be universal, if it be really believed by members\r\nof Parliament, as well as by those who send them to Parliament, in my\r\njudgment the Lords should yield at once, and should not resist it.\r\n\r\nMy main reason is one which has not been much urged. As a theoretical\r\nwriter I can venture to say, what no elected member of Parliament,\r\nConservative or Liberal, can venture to say, that I am exceedingly\r\nafraid of the ignorant multitude of the new constituencies. I wish to\r\nhave as great and as compact a power as possible to resist it. But a\r\ndissension between the Lords and Commons divides that resisting power;\r\nas I have explained, the House of Commons still mainly represents the\r\nplutocracy, the Lords represent the aristocracy. The main interest of\r\nboth these classes is now identical, which is to prevent or to mitigate\r\nthe rule of uneducated numbers. But to prevent it effectually, they\r\nmust not quarrel among themselves; they must not bid one against the\r\nother for the aid of their common opponent. And this is precisely the\r\neffect of a division between Lords and Commons. The two great bodies of\r\nthe educated rich go to the constituencies to decide between them, and\r\nthe majority of the constituencies now consist of the uneducated poor.\r\nThis cannot be for the advantage of any one.\r\n\r\nIn doing so besides the aristocracy forfeit their natural\r\nposition--that by which they would gain most power, and in which they\r\nwould do most good. They ought to be the heads of the plutocracy. In\r\nall countries new wealth is ready to worship old wealth, if old wealth\r\nwill only let it, and I need not say that in England new wealth is\r\neager in its worship. Satirist after satirist has told us how quick,\r\nhow willing, how anxious are the newly-made rich to associate with the\r\nancient rich. Rank probably in no country whatever has so much \"market\"\r\nvalue as it has in England just now. Of course there have been many\r\ncountries in which certain old families, whether rich or poor, were\r\nworshipped by whole populations with a more intense and poetic homage;\r\nbut I doubt if there has ever been any in which all old families and\r\nall titled families received more ready observance from those who were\r\ntheir equals, perhaps their superiors, in wealth, their equals in\r\nculture, and their inferiors only in descent and rank. The possessors\r\nof the \"material\" distinctions of life, as a political economist would\r\nclass them, rush to worship those who possess the immaterial\r\ndistinctions. Nothing can be more politically useful than such homage,\r\nif it be skilfully used; no folly can be idler than to repel and reject\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe worship is the more politically important because it is the worship\r\nof the political superior for the political inferior. At an election\r\nthe non-titled are much more powerful than the titled. Certain\r\nindividual peers have, from their great possessions, great\r\nelectioneering influence, but, as a whole, the House of Peers is not a\r\nprincipal electioneering force. It has so many poor men inside it, and\r\nso many rich men outside it, that its electioneering value is impaired.\r\nBesides, it is in the nature of the curious influence of rank to work\r\nmuch more on men singly than on men collectively; it is an influence\r\nwhich most men--at least most Englishmen--feel very much, but of which\r\nmost Englishmen are somewhat ashamed. Accordingly, when any number of\r\nmen are collected together, each of whom worships rank in his heart,\r\nthe whole body will patiently hear--in many cases will cheer and\r\napprove--some rather strong speeches against rank. Each man is a little\r\nafraid that his \"sneaking kindness for a lord,\" as Mr. Gladstone put\r\nit, be found out; he is not sure how far that weakness is shared by\r\nthose around him. And thus Englishmen easily find themselves committed\r\nto anti-aristocratic sentiments which are the direct opposite of their\r\nreal feeling, and their collective action may be bitterly hostile to\r\nrank while the secret sentiment of each separately is especially\r\nfavourable to rank. In 1832 the close boroughs, which were largely held\r\nby peers, and were still more largely supposed to be held by them, were\r\nswept away with a tumult of delight; and in another similar time of\r\ngreat excitement, the Lords themselves, if they deserve it, might pass\r\naway. The democratic passions gain by fomenting a diffused excitement,\r\nand by massing men in concourses; the aristocratic sentiments gain by\r\ncalm and quiet, and act most on men by themselves, in their families,\r\nand when female influence is not absent. The overt electioneering power\r\nof the Lords does not at all equal its real social power. The English\r\nplutocracy, as is often said of something yet coarser, must be\r\n\"humoured, not drove\"; they may easily be impelled against the\r\naristocracy, though they respect it very much; and as they are much\r\nstronger than the aristocracy, they might, if angered, even destroy it;\r\nthough in order to destroy it, they must help to arouse a wild\r\nexcitement among the ignorant poor, which, if once roused, may not be\r\neasily calmed, and which may be fatal to far more than its beginners\r\nintend.\r\n\r\nThis is the explanation of the anomaly which puzzles many clever lords.\r\nThey think, if they do not say, \"Why are we pinned up here? Why are we\r\nnot in the Commons where we could have so much more power? Why is this\r\nnominal rank given us, at the price of substantial influence? If we\r\nprefer real weight to unreal prestige, why may we not have it?\" The\r\nreply is, that the whole body of the Lords have an incalculably greater\r\ninfluence over society while there is still a House of Lords, than they\r\nwould have if the House of Lords were abolished; and that though one or\r\ntwo clever young peers might do better in the Commons, the old order of\r\npeers, young and old, clever and not clever, is much better where it\r\nis. The selfish instinct of the mass of peers on this point is a keener\r\nand more exact judge of the real world than the fine intelligence of\r\none or two of them.\r\n\r\nIf the House of Peers ever goes, it will go in a storm, and the storm\r\nwill not leave all else as it is. It will not destroy the House of\r\nPeers and leave the rich young peers, with their wealth and their\r\ntitles, to sit in the Commons. It would probably sweep all titles\r\nbefore it--at least all legal titles--and somehow or other it would\r\nbreak up the curious system by which the estates of great families all\r\ngo to the eldest son. That system is a very artificial one; you may\r\nmake a fine argument for it, but you cannot make a loud argument, an\r\nargument which would reach and rule the multitude. The thing looks like\r\ninjustice, and in a time of popular passion it would not stand. Much\r\nshort of the compulsory equal division of the Code Napoleon, stringent\r\nclauses might be provided to obstruct and prevent these great\r\naggregations of property. Few things certainly are less likely than a\r\nviolent tempest like this to destroy large and hereditary estates. But\r\nthen, too, few things are less likely than an outbreak to destroy the\r\nHouse of Lords--my point is, that a catastrophe which levels one will\r\nnot spare the other.\r\n\r\nI conceive, therefore, that the great power of the House of Lords\r\nshould be exercised very timidly and very cautiously. For the sake of\r\nkeeping the headship of the plutocracy, and through that of the nation,\r\nthey should not offend the plutocracy; the points upon which they have\r\nto yield are mostly very minor ones, and they should yield many great\r\npoints rather than risk the bottom of their power. They should give\r\nlarge donations out of income, if by so doing they keep, as they would\r\nkeep, their capital intact. The Duke of Wellington guided the House of\r\nLords in this manner for years, and nothing could prosper better for\r\nthem or for the country, and the Lords have only to go back to the good\r\npath in which he directed them.\r\n\r\nThe events of 1870 caused much discussion upon life peerages, and we\r\nhave gained this great step, that whereas the former leader of the Tory\r\nparty in the Lords--Lord Lyndhurst--defeated the last proposal to make\r\nlife peers, Lord Derby, when leader of that party, desired to create\r\nthem. As I have given in this book what seemed to me good reasons for\r\nmaking them, I need not repeat those reasons here; I need only say how\r\nthe notion stands in my judgment now.\r\n\r\nI cannot look on life peerages in the way in which some of their\r\nstrongest advocates regard them; I cannot think of them as a mode in\r\nwhich a permanent opposition or a contrast between the Houses of Lords\r\nand Commons is to be remedied. To be effectual in that way, life\r\npeerages must be very numerous. Now the House of Lords will never\r\nconsent to a very numerous life peerage without a storm; they must be\r\nin terror to do it, or they will not do it. And if the storm blows\r\nstrongly enough to do so much, in all likelihood it will blow strongly\r\nenough to do much more. If the revolution is powerful enough and eager\r\nenough to make an immense number of life peers, probably it will sweep\r\naway the hereditary principle in the Upper Chamber entirely. Of course\r\none may fancy it to be otherwise; we may conceive of a political storm\r\njust going to a life-peerage limit, and then stopping suddenly. But in\r\npolitics we must not trouble ourselves with exceedingly exceptional\r\naccidents; it is quite difficult enough to count on and provide for the\r\nregular and plain probabilities. To speak mathematically, we may easily\r\nmiss the permanent course of the political curve if we engross our\r\nminds with its cusps and conjugate points.\r\n\r\nNor, on the other hand, can I sympathise with the objection to life\r\npeerages which some of the Radical party take and feel. They think it\r\nwill strengthen the Lords, and so make them better able to oppose the\r\nCommons; they think, if they do not say: \"The House of Lords is our\r\nenemy and that of all Liberals; happily the mass of it is not\r\nintellectual; a few clever men are born there which we cannot help, but\r\nwe will not 'vaccinate' it with genius; we will not put in a set of\r\nclever men for their lives who may as likely as not turn against us\".\r\nThis objection assumes that clever peers are just as likely to oppose\r\nthe Commons as stupid peers. But this I deny. Most clever men who are\r\nin such a good place as the House of Lords plainly is, will be very\r\nunwilling to lose it if they can help it; at the clear call of a great\r\nduty they might lose it, but only at such a call. And it does not take\r\na clever man to see that systematic opposition of the Commons is the\r\nonly thing which can endanger the Lords, or which will make an\r\nindividual peer cease to be a peer. The greater you make the SENSE of\r\nthe Lords, the more they will see that their plain interest is to make\r\nfriends of the plutocracy, and to be the chiefs of it, and not to wish\r\nto oppose the Commons where that plutocracy rules.\r\n\r\nIt is true that a completely new House of Lords, mainly composed of men\r\nof ability, selected because they were able, might very likely attempt\r\nto make ability the predominant power in the State, and to rival, if\r\nnot conquer, the House of Commons, where the standard of intelligence\r\nis not much above the common English average. But in the present\r\nEnglish world such a House of Lords would soon lose all influence.\r\nPeople would say, \"it was too clever by half,\" and in an Englishman's\r\nmouth that means a very severe censure. The English people would think\r\nit grossly anomalous if their elected assembly of rich men were\r\nthwarted by a nominated assembly of talkers and writers. Sensible men\r\nof substantial means are what we wish to be ruled by, and a peerage of\r\ngenius would not compare with it in power.\r\n\r\nIt is true, too, that at present some of the cleverest peers are not so\r\nready as some others to agree with the Commons. But it is not unnatural\r\nthat persons of high rank and of great ability should be unwilling to\r\nbend to persons of lower rank, and of certainly not greater ability. A\r\nfew of such peers (for they are very few) might say, \"We had rather not\r\nhave our peerage if we are to buy it at the price of yielding\". But a\r\nlife peer who had fought his way up to the peers, would never think so.\r\nYoung men who are born to rank may risk it, not middle-aged or old men\r\nwho have earned their rank. A moderate number of life peers would\r\nalmost always counsel moderation to the Lords, and would almost always\r\nbe right in counselling it.\r\n\r\nRecent discussions have also brought into curious prominence another\r\npart of the Constitution. I said in this book that it would very much\r\nsurprise people if they were only told how many things the Queen could\r\ndo without consulting Parliament, and it certainly has so proved, for\r\nwhen the Queen abolished Purchase in the Army by an act of prerogative\r\n(after the Lords had rejected the bill for doing so), there was a great\r\nand general astonishment.\r\n\r\nBut this is nothing to what the Queen can by law do without consulting\r\nParliament. Not to mention other things, she could disband the army (by\r\nlaw she cannot engage more than a certain number of men, but she is not\r\nobliged to engage any men); she could dismiss all the officers, from\r\nthe General Commanding-in-Chief downwards; she could dismiss all the\r\nsailors too; she could sell off all our ships of war and all our naval\r\nstores; she could make a peace by the sacrifice of Cornwall, and begin\r\na war for the conquest of Brittany. She could make every citizen in the\r\nUnited Kingdom, male or female, a peer; she could make every parish in\r\nthe United Kingdom a \"university\"; she could dismiss most of the civil\r\nservants; she could pardon all offenders. In a word, the Queen could by\r\nprerogative upset all the action of civil government within the\r\nGovernment, could disgrace the nation by a bad war or peace, and could,\r\nby disbanding our forces, whether land or sea, leave us defenceless\r\nagainst foreign nations. Why do we not fear that she would do this, or\r\nany approach to it?\r\n\r\nBecause there are two checks--one ancient and coarse, the other modern\r\nand delicate. The first is the check of impeachment. Any Minister who\r\nadvised the Queen so to use her prerogative as to endanger the safety\r\nof the realm, might be impeached for high treason, and would be so.\r\nSuch a Minister would, in our technical law, be said to have levied, or\r\naided to levy, \"war against the Queen\". This counsel to her so to use\r\nher prerogative would by the Judge be declared to be an act of violence\r\nagainst herself, and in that peculiar but effectual way the offender\r\ncould be condemned and executed. Against all gross excesses of the\r\nprerogative this is a sufficient protection. But it would be no\r\nprotection against minor mistakes; any error of judgment committed bona\r\nfide, and only entailing consequences which one person might say were\r\ngood, and another say were bad, could not be so punished. It would be\r\npossible to impeach any Minister who disbanded the Queen's army, and it\r\nwould be done for certain. But suppose a Minister were to reduce the\r\narmy or the navy much below the contemplated strength--suppose he were\r\nonly to spend upon them one-third of the amount which Parliament had\r\npermitted him to spend--suppose a Minister of Lord Palmerston's\r\nprinciples were suddenly and while in office converted to the\r\nprinciples of Mr. Bright and Mr. Cobden, and were to act on those\r\nprinciples, he could not be impeached. The law of treason neither could\r\nnor ought to be enforced against an act which was an error of judgment,\r\nnot of intention--which was in good faith intended not to impair the\r\nwell-being of the State, but to promote and augment it. Against such\r\nmisuses of the prerogative our remedy is a change of Ministry. And in\r\ngeneral this works very well. Every Minister looks long before he\r\nincurs that penalty, and no one incurs it wantonly. But, nevertheless,\r\nthere are two defects in it. The first is that it may not be a remedy\r\nat all; it may be only a punishment. A Minister may risk his dismissal;\r\nhe may do some act difficult to undo, and then all which may be left\r\nwill be to remove and censure him. And the second is that it is only\r\none House of Parliament which has much to say to this remedy, such as\r\nit is; the House of Commons only can remove a Minister by a vote of\r\ncensure. Most of the Ministries for thirty years have never possessed\r\nthe confidence of the Lords, and in such cases a vote of censure by the\r\nLords could therefore have but little weight; it would be simply the\r\nparticular expression of a general political disapproval. It would be\r\nlike a vote of censure on a Liberal Government by the Carlton, or on a\r\nTory Government by the Reform Club. And in no case has an adverse vote\r\nby the Lords the same decisive effect as a vote of the Commons; the\r\nLower House is the ruling and the choosing House, and if a Government\r\nreally possesses that, it thoroughly possesses nine-tenths of what it\r\nrequires. The support of the Lords is an aid and a luxury; that of the\r\nCommons is a strict and indispensable necessary.\r\n\r\nThese difficulties are particularly raised by questions of foreign\r\npolicy. On most domestic subjects, either custom or legislation has\r\nlimited the use of the prerogative. The mode of governing the country,\r\naccording to the existing laws, is mostly worn into a rut, and most\r\nadministrations move in it because it is easier to move there than\r\nanywhere else. Most political crises--the decisive votes, which\r\ndetermine the fate of Government--are generally either on questions of\r\nforeign policy or of new laws; and the questions of foreign policy come\r\nout generally in this way, that the Government has already done\r\nsomething, and that it is for the one part of the legislature\r\nalone--for the House of Commons, and not for the House of Lords--to say\r\nwhether they have or have not forfeited their place by the treaty they\r\nhave made.\r\n\r\nI think every one must admit that this is not an arrangement which\r\nseems right on the face of it. Treaties are quite as important as most\r\nlaws, and to require the elaborate assent of representative assemblies\r\nto every word of the law, and not to consult them even as to the\r\nessence of the treaty, is prima facie ludicrous. In the older forms of\r\nthe English Constitution, this may have been quite right; the power was\r\nthen really lodged in the Crown, and because Parliament met very\r\nseldom, and for other reasons, it was then necessary that, on a\r\nmultitude of points, the Crown should have much more power than is\r\namply sufficient for it at present. But now the real power is not in\r\nthe Sovereign, it is in the Prime Minister and in the Cabinet--that is,\r\nin the hands of a committee appointed by Parliament, and of the\r\nchairman of that committee. Now, beforehand, no one would have ventured\r\nto suggest that a committee of Parliament on foreign relations should\r\nbe able to commit the country to the greatest international obligations\r\nwithout consulting either Parliament or the country. No other select\r\ncommittee has any comparable power; and considering how carefully we\r\nhave fettered and limited the powers of all other subordinate\r\nauthorities, our allowing so much discretionary power on matters\r\npeculiarly dangerous and peculiarly delicate to rest in the sole charge\r\nof one secret committee is exceedingly strange. No doubt it may be\r\nbeneficial; many seeming anomalies are so, but at first sight it does\r\nnot look right.\r\n\r\nI confess that I should see no advantage in it if our two Chambers were\r\nsufficiently homogeneous and sufficiently harmonious. On the contrary,\r\nif those two Chambers were as they ought to be, I should believe it to\r\nbe a great defect. If the administration had in both Houses a\r\nmajority--not a mechanical majority ready to accept anything, but a\r\nfair and reasonable one, predisposed to think the Government right, but\r\nnot ready to find it to be so in the face of facts and in opposition to\r\nwhatever might occur; if a good Government were thus placed, I should\r\nthink it decidedly better that the agreements of the administration\r\nwith foreign powers should be submitted to Parliament. They would then\r\nreceive that which is best for all arrangements of business, an\r\nunderstanding and sympathising criticism, but still a criticism. The\r\nmajority of the legislature, being well disposed to the Government,\r\nwould not \"find\" against it except it had really committed some big and\r\nplain mistake. But if the Government had made such a mistake, certainly\r\nthe majority of the legislature would find against it. In a country fit\r\nfor Parliamentary institutions, the partisanship of members of the\r\nlegislature never comes in manifest opposition to the plain interest of\r\nthe nation; if it did, the nation being (as are all nations capable of\r\nParliamentary institutions) constantly attentive to public affairs,\r\nwould inflict on them the maximum Parliamentary penalty at the next\r\nelection and at many future elections. It would break their career. No\r\nEnglish majority dare vote for an exceedingly bad treaty; it would\r\nrather desert its own leader than ensure its own ruin. And an English\r\nminority, inheriting a long experience of Parliamentary affairs, would\r\nnot be exceedingly ready to reject a treaty made with a foreign\r\nGovernment. The leaders of an English Opposition are very conversant\r\nwith the school-boy maxim, \"Two can play at that fun\". They know that\r\nthe next time they are in office the same sort of sharp practice may be\r\nused against them, and therefore they will not use it. So strong is\r\nthis predisposition, that not long since a subordinate member of the\r\nOpposition declared that the \"front benches\" of the two sides of the\r\nHouse--that is, the leaders of the Government and the leaders of the\r\nOpposition--were in constant tacit league to suppress the objections of\r\nindependent members. And what he said is often quite true. There are\r\noften seeming objections which are not real objections; at least, which\r\nare, in the particular cases, outweighed by counter-considerations; and\r\nthese \"independent members,\" having no real responsibility, not being\r\nlikely to be hurt themselves if they make a mistake, are sure to blurt\r\nout, and to want to act upon. But the responsible heads of the party\r\nwho may have to decide similar things, or even the same things\r\nthemselves, will not permit it. They refuse, out of interest as well as\r\nout of patriotism, to engage the country in a permanent foreign scrape,\r\nto secure for themselves and their party a momentary home advantage.\r\nAccordingly, a Government which negotiated a treaty would feel that its\r\ntreaty would be subject certainly to a scrutiny, but still to a candid\r\nand lenient scrutiny; that it would go before judges, of whom the\r\nmajority were favourable, and among whom the most influential part of\r\nthe minority were in this case much opposed to excessive antagonism.\r\nAnd this seems to be the best position in which negotiators can be\r\nplaced, namely, that they should be sure to have to account to\r\nconsiderate and fair persons, but not to have to account to\r\ninconsiderate and unfair ones. At present the Government which\r\nnegotiates a treaty can hardly be said to be accountable to any one. It\r\nis sure to be subjected to vague censure. Benjamin Franklin said, \"I\r\nhave never known a peace made, even the most advantageous, that was not\r\ncensured as inadequate, and the makers condemned as injudicious or\r\ncorrupt. 'Blessed are the peace-makers' is, I suppose, to be understood\r\nin the other world, for in this they are frequently cursed.\" And this\r\nis very often the view taken now in England of treaties. There being\r\nnothing practical in the Opposition--nothing likely to hamper them\r\nhereafter--the leaders of Opposition are nearly sure to suggest every\r\nobjection. The thing is done and cannot be undone, and the most natural\r\nwish of the Opposition leaders is to prove that if they had been in\r\noffice, and it therefore had been theirs to do it, they could have done\r\nit much better. On the other hand, it is quite possible that there may\r\nbe no real criticism on a treaty at all; or the treaty has been made by\r\nthe Government, and as it cannot be unmade by any one, the Opposition\r\nmay not think it worth while to say much about it. The Government,\r\ntherefore, is never certain of any criticism; on the contrary, it has a\r\ngood chance of escaping criticism; but if there be any criticism the\r\nGovernment must expect it to be bitter, sharp, and captious--made as an\r\nirresponsible objector would make it, and not as a responsible\r\nstatesman, who may have to deal with a difficulty if he make it, and\r\ntherefore will be cautious how he says anything which may make it.\r\n\r\nThis is what happens in common cases; and in the uncommon--the\r\nninety-ninth case in a hundred--in which the Opposition hoped to turn\r\nout the Government because of the alleged badness of the treaty they\r\nhave made, the criticism is sure to be of the most undesirable\r\ncharacter, and to say what is most offensive to foreign nations. All\r\nthe practised acumen of anti-Government writers and speakers is sure to\r\nbe engaged in proving that England has been imposed upon--that, as was\r\nsaid in one case, \"The moral and the intellectual qualities have been\r\ndivided; that our negotiation had the moral, and the negotiation on the\r\nother side the intellectual,\" and so on. The whole pitch of party\r\nmalice is then expended, because there is nothing to check the party in\r\nopposition. The treaty has been made, and though it may be censured,\r\nand the party which made it ousted, yet the difficulty it was meant to\r\ncure is cured, and the opposing party, if it takes office, will not\r\nhave that difficulty to deal with.\r\n\r\nIn abstract theory these defects in our present practice would seem\r\nexceedingly great, but in practice they are not so. English statesmen\r\nand English parties have really a great patriotism; they can rarely be\r\npersuaded even by their passions or their interest to do anything\r\ncontrary to the real interest of England, or anything which would lower\r\nEngland in the eyes of foreign nations. And they would seriously hurt\r\nthemselves if they did. But still these are the real tendencies of our\r\npresent practice, and these are only prevented by qualities in the\r\nnation and qualities in our statesmen, which will just as much exist if\r\nwe change our practice.\r\n\r\nIt certainly would be in many ways advantageous to change it. If we\r\nrequire that in some form the assent of Parliament shall be given to\r\nsuch treaties, we should have a real discussion prior to the making of\r\nsuch treaties. We should have the reasons for the treaty plainly\r\nstated, and also the reasons against it. At present, as we have seen,\r\nthe discussion is unreal. The thing is done and cannot be altered; and\r\nwhat is said often ought not to be said because it is captious, and\r\nwhat is not said ought as often to be said because it is material. We\r\nshould have a manlier and plainer way of dealing with foreign policy,\r\nif Ministers were obliged to explain clearly their foreign contracts\r\nbefore they were valid, just as they have to explain their domestic\r\nproposals before they can become laws. The objections to this are, as\r\nfar as I know, three, and three only.\r\n\r\nFirst, that it would not be always desirable for Ministers to state\r\nclearly the motives which induced them to agree to foreign compacts.\r\n\"Treaties,\" it is said, \"are in one great respect different from laws,\r\nthey concern not only the Government which binds, the nation so bound,\r\nbut a third party too--a foreign country--and the feelings of that\r\ncountry are to be considered as well as our own. And that foreign\r\ncountry will, probably, in the present state of the world be a despotic\r\none, where discussion is not practised, where it is not understood,\r\nwhere the expressions of different speakers are not accurately weighed,\r\nwhere undue offence may easily be given.\" This objection might be\r\neasily avoided by requiring that the discussion upon treaties in\r\nParliament like that discussion in the American Senate should be \"in\r\nsecret session,\" and that no report should be published of it. But I\r\nshould, for my own part, be rather disposed to risk a public debate.\r\nDespotic nations now cannot understand England; it is to them an\r\nanomaly \"chartered by Providence\"; they have been time out of mind\r\npuzzled by its institutions, vexed at its statesmen, and angry at its\r\nnewspapers. A little more of such perplexity and such vexation does not\r\nseem to me a great evil. And if it be meant, as it often is meant, that\r\nthe whole truth as to treaties cannot be spoken out, I answer, that\r\nneither can the whole truth as to laws. All important laws affect large\r\n\"vested interests\"; they touch great sources of political strength; and\r\nthese great interests require to be treated as delicately, and with as\r\nnice a manipulation of language, as the feelings of any foreign\r\ncountry. A Parliamentary Minister is a man trained by elaborate\r\npractice not to blurt out crude things, and an English Parliament is an\r\nassembly which particularly dislikes anything gauche or anything\r\nimprudent. They would still more dislike it if it hurt themselves and\r\nthe country as well as the speaker.\r\n\r\nI am, too, disposed to deny entirely that there can be any treaty for\r\nwhich adequate reasons cannot be given to the English people, which the\r\nEnglish people ought to make. A great deal of the reticence of\r\ndiplomacy had, I think history shows, much better be spoken out. The\r\nworst families are those in which the members never really speak their\r\nminds to one another; they maintain an atmosphere of unreality, and\r\nevery one always lives in an atmosphere of suppressed ill-feeling. It\r\nis the same with nations. The parties concerned would almost always be\r\nbetter for hearing the substantial reasons which induced the\r\nnegotiators to make the treaty, and the negotiators would do their work\r\nmuch better, for half the ambiguities in treaties are caused by the\r\nnegotiators not liking the fact or not taking the pains to put their\r\nown meaning distinctly before their own minds. And they would be\r\nobliged to make it plain if they had to defend it and argue on it\r\nbefore a great assembly.\r\n\r\nSecondly, it may be objected to the change suggested that Parliament is\r\nnot always sitting, and that if treaties required its assent, it might\r\nhave to be sometimes summoned out of season, or the treaties would have\r\nto be delayed. And this is as far as it goes a just objection, but I do\r\nnot imagine that it goes far. The great bulk of treaties could wait a\r\nlittle without harm, and in the very few cases when urgent haste is\r\nnecessary, an autumn session of Parliament could well be justified, for\r\nthe occasion must be of grave and critical importance.\r\n\r\nThirdly, it may be said that if we required the consent of both Houses\r\nof Parliament to foreign treaties before they were valid we should much\r\naugment the power of the House of Lords. And this is also, I think, a\r\njust objection as far as it goes. The House of Lords, as it cannot turn\r\nout the Ministry for making treaties, has in no case a decisive weight\r\nin foreign policy, though its debates on them are often excellent; and\r\nthere is a real danger at present in giving it such weight. They are\r\nnot under the same guidance as the House of Commons. In the House of\r\nCommons, of necessity, the Ministry has a majority, and the majority\r\nwill agree to the treaties the leaders have made if they fairly can.\r\nThey will not be anxious to disagree with them. But the majority of the\r\nHouse of Lords may always be, and has lately been generally an\r\nopposition majority, and therefore the treaty may be submitted to\r\ncritics exactly pledged to opposite views. It might be like submitting\r\nthe design of an architect known to hold \"mediaeval principles\" to a\r\ncommittee wedded to \"classical principles\".\r\n\r\nStill, upon the whole, I think the augmentation of the power of the\r\npeers might be risked without real fear of serious harm. Our present\r\npractice, as has been explained, only works because of the good sense\r\nof those by whom it is worked, and the new practice would have to rely\r\non a similar good sense and practicality too. The House of Lords must\r\ndeal with the assent to treaties as they do with the assent to laws;\r\nthey must defer to the voice of the country and the authority of the\r\nCommons even in cases where their own judgment might guide them\r\notherwise. In very vital treaties probably, being Englishmen, they\r\nwould be of the same mind as the rest of Englishmen. If in such cases\r\nthey showed a reluctance to act as the people wished, they would have\r\nthe same lesson taught them as on vital and exciting questions of\r\ndomestic legislation, and the case is not so likely to happen, for on\r\nthese internal and organic questions the interest and the feeling of\r\nthe peers is often presumably opposed to that of other classes--they\r\nmay be anxious not to relinquish the very power which other classes are\r\nanxious to acquire; but in foreign policy there is no similar\r\nantagonism of interest--a peer and a non-peer have presumably in that\r\nmatter the same interest and the same wishes.\r\n\r\nProbably, if it were considered to be desirable to give to Parliament a\r\nmore direct control over questions of foreign policy than it possesses\r\nnow, the better way would be not to require a formal vote to the treaty\r\nclause by clause. This would entail too much time, and would lead to\r\nunnecessary changes in minor details. It would be enough to let the\r\ntreaty be laid upon the table of both Houses, say for fourteen days,\r\nand to acquire validity unless objected to by one House or other before\r\nthat interval had expired.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nThis is all which I think I need say on the domestic events which have\r\nchanged, or suggested changes, in the English Constitution since this\r\nbook was written. But there are also some foreign events which have\r\nillustrated it, and of these I should like to say a few words.\r\n\r\nNaturally, the most striking of these illustrative changes comes from\r\nFrance. Since 1789 France has always been trying political experiments,\r\nfrom which others may profit much, though as yet she herself has\r\nprofited little. She is now trying one singularly illustrative of the\r\nEnglish Constitution. When the first edition of this book was published\r\nI had great difficulty in persuading many people that it was possible\r\nin a non-monarchical State, for the real chief of the practical\r\nexecutive--the Premier as we should call him--to be nominated and to be\r\nremovable by the vote of the National Assembly. The United States and\r\nits copies were the only present and familiar Republics, and in these\r\nthe system was exactly opposite. The executive was there appointed by\r\nthe people as the legislature was too. No conspicuous example of any\r\nother sort of Republic then existed. But now France has given an\r\nexample--M. Thiers is (with one exception) just the chef du pouvoir\r\nexecutif that I endeavoured more than once in this book to describe. He\r\nis appointed by and is removable by the Assembly. He comes down and\r\nspeaks in it just as our Premier does; he is responsible for managing\r\nit just as our Premier is. No one can any longer doubt the possibility\r\nof a republic in which the executive and the legislative authorities\r\nwere united and fixed; no one can assert such union to be the\r\nincommunicable attribute of a Constitutional Monarchy. But,\r\nunfortunately, we can as yet only infer from this experiment that such\r\na Constitution is possible; we cannot as yet say whether it will be bad\r\nor good. The circumstances are very peculiar, and that in three ways.\r\nFirst, the trial of a specially Parliamentary Republic, of a Republic\r\nwhere Parliament appoints the Minister, is made in a nation which has,\r\nto say the least of it, no peculiar aptitude for Parliamentary\r\nGovernment; which has possibly a peculiar inaptitude for it. In the\r\nlast but one of these essays I have tried to describe one of the mental\r\nconditions of Parliamentary Government, which I call \"rationality,\" by\r\nwhich I do not mean reasoning power, but rather the power of hearing\r\nthe reasons of others, of comparing them quietly with one's own\r\nreasons, and then being guided by the result. But a French Assembly is\r\nnot easy to reason with. Every assembly is divided into parties and\r\ninto sections of parties, and in France each party, almost every\r\nsection of a party, begins not to clamour but to scream, and to scream\r\nas only Frenchmen can, as soon as it hears anything which it\r\nparticularly dislikes. With an Assembly in this temper, real discussion\r\nis impossible, and Parliamentary government is impossible too, because\r\nthe Parliament can neither choose men nor measures. The French\r\nassemblies under the Restored Monarchy seem to have been quieter,\r\nprobably because being elected from a limited constituency they did not\r\ncontain so many sections of opinion; they had fewer irritants and fewer\r\nspecies of irritability. But the assemblies of the '48 Republic were\r\ndisorderly in the extreme. I saw the last myself, and can certify that\r\nsteady discussion upon a critical point was not possible in it. There\r\nwas not an audience willing to hear. The Assembly now sitting at\r\nVersailles is undoubtedly also, at times, most tumultuous, and a\r\nParliamentary government in which it governs must be under a peculiar\r\ndifficulty, because as a sovereign it is unstable, capricious, and\r\nunruly.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty is the greater because there is no check, or little,\r\nfrom the French nation upon the Assembly. The French, as a nation, do\r\nnot care for or appreciate Parliamentary government. I have endeavoured\r\nto explain how difficult it is for inexperienced mankind to take to\r\nsuch a government; how much more natural, that is, how much more easy\r\nto uneducated men is loyalty to a monarch. A nation which does not\r\nexpect good from a Parliament, cannot check or punish a Parliament.\r\nFrance expects, I fear, too little from her Parliaments ever to get\r\nwhat she ought. Now that the suffrage is universal, the average\r\nintellect and the average culture of the constituent bodies are\r\nexcessively low; and even such mind and culture as there is has long\r\nbeen enslaved to authority; the French peasant cares more for standing\r\nwell with his present prefet than for anything else whatever; he is far\r\ntoo ignorant to check and watch his Parliament, and far too timid to\r\nthink of doing either if the executive authority nearest to him does\r\nnot like it. The experiment of a strictly Parliamentary Republic--of a\r\nRepublic where the Parliament appoints the executive--is being tried in\r\nFrance at an extreme disadvantage, because in France a Parliament is\r\nunusually likely to be bad, and unusually likely also to be free enough\r\nto show its badness. Secondly, the present polity of France is not a\r\ncopy of the whole effective part of the British Constitution, but only\r\na part of it. By our Constitution nominally the Queen, but really the\r\nPrime Minister, has the power of dissolving the Assembly. But M. Thiers\r\nhas no such power; and therefore, under ordinary circumstances, I\r\nbelieve, the policy would soon become unmanageable. The result would\r\nbe, as I have tried to explain, that the Assembly would be always\r\nchanging its Ministry, that having no reason to fear the penalty which\r\nthat change so often brings in England, they would be ready to make it\r\nonce a month. Caprice is the characteristic vice of miscellaneous\r\nassemblies, and without some check their selection would be unceasingly\r\nmutable. This peculiar danger of the present Constitution of France has\r\nhowever been prevented by its peculiar circumstances. The Assembly have\r\nnot been inclined to remove M. Thiers, because in their lamentable\r\npresent position they could not replace M. Thiers. He has a monopoly of\r\nthe necessary reputation. It is the Empire--the Empire which he always\r\nopposed--that has done him this kindness. For twenty years no great\r\npolitical reputation could arise in France. The Emperor governed and no\r\none member could show a capacity for government. M. Rouher, though of\r\nvast real ability, was in the popular idea only the Emperor's agent;\r\nand even had it been otherwise, M. Rouher, the one great man of\r\nImperialism, could not have been selected as a head of the Government,\r\nat a moment of the greatest reaction against the Empire. Of the chiefs\r\nbefore the twenty years' silence, of the eminent men known to be able\r\nto handle Parliaments and to govern Parliaments, M. Thiers was the only\r\none still physically able to begin again to do so. The miracle is, that\r\nat seventy-four even he should still be able. As no other great chief\r\nof the Parliament regime existed, M. Thiers is not only the best\r\nchoice, but the only choice. If he were taken away, it would be most\r\ndifficult to make any other choice, and that difficulty keeps him where\r\nhe is. At every crisis the Assembly feels that after M. Thiers \"the\r\ndeluge,\" and he lives upon that feeling. A change of the President,\r\nthough legally simple, is in practice all but impossible; because all\r\nknow that such a change might be a change, not only of the President,\r\nbut of much more too: that very probably it might be a change of the\r\npolity--that it might bring in a Monarchy or an Empire.\r\n\r\nLastly, by a natural consequence of the position, M. Thiers does not\r\ngovern as a Parliamentary Premier governs. He is not, he boasts that he\r\nis not, the head of a party. On the contrary, being the one person\r\nessential to all parties, he selects Ministers from all parties, he\r\nconstructs a Cabinet in which no one Minister agrees with any other in\r\nanything, and with all the members of which he himself frequently\r\ndisagrees. The selection is quite in his hand. Ordinarily a\r\nParliamentary Premier cannot choose; he is brought in by a party; he is\r\nmaintained in office by a party; and that party requires that as they\r\naid him, he shall aid them; that as they give him the very best thing\r\nin the State, he shall give them the next best things. But M. Thiers is\r\nunder no such restriction. He can choose as he likes, and does choose.\r\nNeither in the selection of his Cabinet nor in the management of the\r\nChamber, is M. Thiers guided as a similar person in common\r\ncircumstances would have to be guided. He is the exception of a moment;\r\nhe is not the example of a lasting condition.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, though we may use the present Constitution of France\r\nas a useful aid to our imaginations, in conceiving of a purely\r\nParliamentary Republic, of a monarchy minus the monarch, we must not\r\nthink of it as much more. It is too singular in its nature and too\r\npeculiar in its accidents to be a guide to anything except itself.\r\n\r\nIn this essay I made many remarks on the American Constitution, in\r\ncomparison with the English; and as to the American Constitution we\r\nhave had a whole world of experience since I first wrote. My great\r\nobject was to contrast the office of President as an executive officer\r\nand to compare it with that of a Prime Minister; and I devoted much\r\nspace to showing that in one principal respect the English system is by\r\nfar the best. The English Premier being appointed by the selection, and\r\nbeing removable at the pleasure, of the preponderant Legislative\r\nAssembly, is sure to be able to rely on that Assembly. If he wants\r\nlegislation to aid his policy he can obtain that legislation; he can\r\ncarry out that policy. But the American President has no similar\r\nsecurity. He is elected in one way, at one time, and Congress (no\r\nmatter which House) is elected in another way, at another time. The two\r\nhave nothing to bind them together, and in matter of fact, they\r\ncontinually disagree.\r\n\r\nThis was written in the time of Mr. Lincoln, when Congress, the\r\nPresident, and all the North were united as one man in the war against\r\nthe South. There was then no patent instance of mere disunion. But\r\nbetween the time when the essays were first written in the Fortnightly,\r\nand their subsequent junction into a book, Mr. Lincoln was\r\nassassinated, and Mr. Johnson, the Vice-President, became President,\r\nand so continued for nearly four years. At such a time the\r\ncharacteristic evils of the Presidential system were shown most\r\nconspicuously. The President and the Assembly, so far from being (as it\r\nis essential to good government that they should be) on terms of close\r\nunion, were not on terms of common courtesy. So far from being capable\r\nof a continuous and concerted co-operation they were all the while\r\ntrying to thwart one another. He had one plan for the pacification of\r\nthe South and they another; they would have nothing to say to his\r\nplans, and he vetoed their plans as long as the Constitution permitted,\r\nand when they were, in spite of him, carried, he, as far as he could\r\n(and this was very much), embarrassed them in action. The quarrel in\r\nmost countries would have gone beyond the law, and come to blows; even\r\nin America, the most law-loving of countries, it went as far as\r\npossible within the law. Mr. Johnson described the most popular branch\r\nof the legislature--the House of Representatives--as a body \"hanging on\r\nthe verge of government\"; and that House impeached him criminally, in\r\nthe hope that in that way they might get rid of him civilly. Nothing\r\ncould be so conclusive against the American Constitution, as a\r\nConstitution, as that incident. A hostile legislature and a hostile\r\nexecutive were so tied together, that the legislature tried, and tried\r\nin vain, to rid itself of the executive by accusing it of illegal\r\npractices. The legislature was so afraid of the President's legal power\r\nthat it unfairly accused him of acting beyond the law. And the blame\r\nthus cast on the American Constitution is so much praise to be given to\r\nthe American political character.\r\n\r\nFew nations, perhaps scarcely any nation, could have borne such a trial\r\nso easily and so perfectly. This was the most striking instance of\r\ndisunion between the President and the Congress that has ever yet\r\noccurred, and which probably will ever occur. Probably for very many\r\nyears the United States will have great and painful reason to remember\r\nthat at the moment of all their history, when it was most important to\r\nthem to collect and concentrate all the strength and wisdom of their\r\npolicy on the pacification of the South, that policy was divided by a\r\nstrife in the last degree unseemly and degrading. But it will be for a\r\ncompetent historian hereafter to trace out this accurately and in\r\ndetail; the time is yet too recent, and I cannot pretend that I know\r\nenough to do so. I cannot venture myself to draw the full lessons from\r\nthese events; I can only predict that when they are drawn, those\r\nlessons will be most important, and most interesting. There is,\r\nhowever, one series of events which have happened in America since the\r\nbeginning of the Civil War, and since the first publication of these\r\nessays, on which I should wish to say something in detail--I mean the\r\nfinancial events. These lie within the scope of my peculiar studies,\r\nand it is comparatively easy to judge of them, since whatever may be\r\nthe case with refined statistical reasoning, the great results of money\r\nmatters speak to and interest all mankind. And every incident in this\r\npart of American financial history exemplifies the contrast between a\r\nParliamentary and Presidential government.\r\n\r\nThe distinguishing quality of Parliamentary government is, that in each\r\nstage of a public transaction there is a discussion; that the public\r\nassist at this discussion; that it can, through Parliament, turn out an\r\nadministration which is not doing as it likes, and can put in an\r\nadministration which will do as it likes. But the characteristic of a\r\nPresidential government is, in a multitude of cases, that there is no\r\nsuch discussion; that when there is a discussion the fate of Government\r\ndoes not turn upon it, and, therefore, the people do not attend to it;\r\nthat upon the whole the administration itself is pretty much doing as\r\nit likes, and neglecting as it likes, subject always to the check that\r\nit must not too much offend the mass of the nation. The nation commonly\r\ndoes not attend, but if by gigantic blunders you make it attend, it\r\nwill remember it and turn you out when its time comes; it will show you\r\nthat your power is short, and so on the instant weaken that power; it\r\nwill make your present life in office unbearable and uncomfortable by\r\nthe hundred modes in which a free people can, without ceasing, act upon\r\nthe rulers which it elected yesterday, and will have to reject or\r\nre-elect to-morrow.  In finance the most striking effect in America\r\nhas, on the first view of it, certainly been good. It has enabled the\r\nGovernment to obtain and to keep a vast surplus of revenue over\r\nexpenditure. Even before the Civil War it did this--from 1837 to 1857.\r\nMr. Wells tells us that, strange as it may seem, \"there was not a\r\nsingle year in which the unexpended balance in the National\r\nTreasury--derived from various sources--at the end of the year, was not\r\nin excess of the total expenditure of the preceding year; while in not\r\na few years the unexpended balance was absolutely greater than the sum\r\nof the entire expenditure of the twelve months preceding\". But this\r\nhistory before the war is nothing to what has happened since. The\r\nfollowing are the surpluses of revenue over expenditure since the end\r\nof the Civil War:--\r\n\r\n  Year ending June 30.           Surplus. (pounds)\r\n\r\n  1866 .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .    5,593,000\r\n  1867 .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   21,586,000\r\n  1868 .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .    4,242,000\r\n  1869 .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .    7,418,000\r\n  1870 .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   18,627,000\r\n  1871 .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   16,712,000\r\n\r\nNo one who knows anything of the working of Parliamentary government,\r\nwill for a moment imagine that any Parliament would have allowed any\r\nexecutive to keep a surplus of this magnitude. In England, after the\r\nFrench war, the Government of that day, which had brought it to a happy\r\nend, which had the glory of Waterloo, which was in consequence\r\nexceedingly strong, which had besides elements of strength from close\r\nboroughs and Treasury influence such as certainly no Government has\r\never had since, and such perhaps as no Government ever had before--that\r\nGovernment proposed to keep a moderate surplus and to apply it to the\r\nreduction of the debt, but even this the English Parliament would not\r\nendure. The administration with all its power derived both from good\r\nand evil had to yield; the income tax was abolished, with it went the\r\nsurplus, and with the surplus all chance of any considerable reduction\r\nof the debt for that time. In truth taxation is so painful that in a\r\nsensitive community which has strong organs of expression and action,\r\nthe maintenance of a great surplus is excessively difficult. The\r\nOpposition will always say that it is unnecessary, is uncalled for, is\r\ninjudicious; the cry will be echoed in every constituency; there will\r\nbe a series of large meetings in the great cities; even in the smaller\r\nconstituencies there will mostly be smaller meetings; every member of\r\nParliament will be pressed upon by those who elect him; upon this point\r\nthere will be no distinction between town and country, the country\r\ngentleman and the farmer disliking high taxes as much as any in the\r\ntowns. To maintain a great surplus by heavy taxes to pay off debt has\r\nnever yet in this country been possible, and to maintain a surplus of\r\nthe American magnitude would be plainly impossible.\r\n\r\nSome part of the difference between England and America arises\r\nundoubtedly not from political causes but from economical. America is\r\nnot a country sensitive to taxes; no great country has perhaps ever\r\nbeen so unsensitive in this respect; certainly she is far less\r\nsensitive than England. In reality America is too rich; daily industry\r\nthere is too common, too skilful, and too productive, for her to care\r\nmuch for fiscal burdens. She is applying all the resources of science\r\nand skill and trained labour, which have been in long ages painfully\r\nacquired in old countries, to develop with great speed the richest soil\r\nand the richest mines of new countries; and the result is untold\r\nwealth. Even under a Parliamentary government such a community could\r\nand would bear taxation much more easily than Englishmen ever would.\r\n\r\nBut difference of physical character in this respect is of little\r\nmoment in comparison with difference of political constitution. If\r\nAmerica was under a Parliamentary government, she would soon be\r\nconvinced that in maintaining this great surplus and in paying this\r\nhigh taxation she would be doing herself great harm. She is not\r\nperforming a great duty, but perpetrating a great injustice. She is\r\ninjuring posterity by crippling and displacing industry, far more than\r\nshe is aiding it by reducing the taxes it will have to pay. In the\r\nfirst place, the maintenance of the present high taxation compels the\r\nretention of many taxes which are contrary to the maxims of free-trade.\r\nEnormous customs duties are necessary, and it would be all but\r\nimpossible to impose equal excise duties even if the Americans desired\r\nit. In consequence, besides what the Americans pay to the Government,\r\nthey are paying a great deal to some of their own citizens, and so are\r\nrearing a set of industries which never ought to have existed, which\r\nare bad speculations at present because other industries would have\r\npaid better, and which may cause a great loss out of pocket hereafter\r\nwhen the debt is paid off and the fostering tax withdrawn. Then\r\nprobably industry will return to its natural channel, the artificial\r\ntrade will be first depressed, then discontinued, and the fixed capital\r\nemployed in the trade will all be depreciated and much of it be\r\nworthless. Secondly, all taxes on trade and manufacture are injurious\r\nin various ways to them. You cannot put on a great series of such\r\nduties without cramping trade in a hundred ways and without diminishing\r\ntheir productiveness exceedingly. America is now working in heavy\r\nfetters, and it would probably be better for her to lighten those\r\nfetters even though a generation or two should have to pay rather\r\nhigher taxes. Those generations would really benefit, because they\r\nwould be so much richer that the slightly increased cost of government\r\nwould never be perceived. At any rate, under a Parliamentary government\r\nthis doctrine would have been incessantly inculcated; a whole party\r\nwould have made it their business to preach it, would have made\r\nincessant small motions in Parliament about it, which is the way to\r\npopularise their view. And in the end I do not doubt that they would\r\nhave prevailed. They would have had to teach a lesson both pleasant and\r\ntrue, and such lessons are soon learned. On the whole, therefore, the\r\nresult of the comparison is that a Presidential government makes it\r\nmuch easier than the Parliamentary to maintain a great surplus of\r\nincome over expenditure, but that it does not give the same facility\r\nfor examining whether it be good or not good to maintain a surplus,\r\nand, therefore, that it works blindly, maintaining surpluses when they\r\ndo extreme harm just as much as when they are very beneficial.\r\n\r\nIn this point the contrast of Presidential with Parliamentary\r\ngovernment is mixed; one of the defects of Parliamentary government\r\nprobably is the difficulty under it of maintaining a surplus revenue to\r\ndischarge debt, and this defect Presidential government escapes, though\r\nat the cost of being likely to maintain that surplus upon inexpedient\r\noccasions as well as upon expedient. But in all other respects a\r\nParliamentary government has in finance an unmixed advantage over the\r\nPresidential in the incessant discussion. Though in one single case it\r\nproduces evil as well as good, in most cases it produces good only. And\r\nthree of these cases are illustrated by recent American experience.\r\nFirst, as Mr. Goldwin Smith--no unfavourable judge of anything\r\nAmerican--justly said some years since, the capital error made by the\r\nUnited States Government was the \"Legal Tender Act,\" as it is called,\r\nby which it made inconvertible paper notes issued by the Treasury the\r\nsole circulating medium of the country. The temptation to do this was\r\nvery great, because it gave at once a great war fund when it was\r\nneeded, and with no pain to any one. If the notes of a Government\r\nsupersede the metallic currency medium of a country to the extent of\r\n$80,000,000, this is equivalent to a recent loan of $80,000,000 to the\r\nGovernment for all purposes within the country. Whenever the precious\r\nmetals are not required, and for domestic purposes in such a case they\r\nare not required, notes will buy what the Government want, and it can\r\nbuy to the extent of its issue. But, like all easy expedients out of a\r\ngreat difficulty, it is accompanied by the greatest evils; if it had\r\nnot been so, it would have been the regular device in such cases, and\r\nthe difficulty would have been no difficulty at all; there would have\r\nbeen a known easy way out of it. As is well known, inconvertible paper\r\nissued by Government is sure to be issued in great quantities, as the\r\nAmerican currency soon was; it is sure to be depreciated as against\r\ncoin; it is sure to disturb values and to derange markets; it is\r\ncertain to defraud the lender; it is certain to give the borrower more\r\nthan he ought to have. In the case of America there was a further evil.\r\nBeing a new country, she ought in her times of financial want to borrow\r\nof old countries; but the old countries were frightened by the probable\r\nissue of unlimited inconvertible paper, and they would not lend a\r\nshilling. Much more than the mercantile credit of America was thus\r\nlost. The great commercial houses in England are the most natural and\r\nmost effectual conveyers of intelligence from other countries to\r\nEurope. If they had been financially interested in giving in a sound\r\nreport as to the progress of the war, a sound report we should have\r\nhad. But as the Northern States raised no loans in Lombard Street (and\r\ncould raise none because of their vicious paper money), Lombard Street\r\ndid not care about them, and England was very imperfectly informed of\r\nthe progress of the civil struggle, and on the whole matter, which was\r\nthen new and very complex, England had to judge without having her\r\nusual materials for judgment, and (since the guidance of the \"City\" on\r\npolitical matter is very quietly and imperceptibly given) without\r\nknowing she had not those materials. Of course, this error might have\r\nbeen committed, and perhaps would have been committed under a\r\nParliamentary government. But if it had, its effects would ere long\r\nhave been thoroughly searched into and effectually frustrated. The\r\nwhole force of the greatest inquiring machine and the greatest\r\ndiscussing machine which the world has ever known would have been\r\ndirected to this subject. In a year or two the American public would\r\nhave had it forced upon them in every form till they must have\r\ncomprehended it. But under the Presidential form of government, and\r\nowing to the inferior power of generating discussion, the information\r\ngiven to the American people has been imperfect in the extreme. And in\r\nconsequence, after nearly ten years of painful experience, they do not\r\nnow understand how much they have suffered from their inconvertible\r\ncurrency.\r\n\r\nBut the mode in which the Presidential government of America managed\r\nits taxation during the Civil War, is even a more striking example of\r\nits defects. Mr. Wells tells us:--\r\n\r\n\"In the outset all direct or internal taxation was avoided, there\r\nhaving been apparently an apprehension on the part of Congress, that\r\ninasmuch as the people had never been accustomed to it, and as all\r\nmachinery for assessment and collection was wholly wanting, its\r\nadoption would create discontent, and thereby interfere with a vigorous\r\nprosecution of hostilities. Congress, therefore, confined itself at\r\nfirst to the enactment of measures looking to an increase of revenue\r\nfrom the increase of indirect taxes upon imports; and it was not until\r\nfour months after the actual outbreak of hostilities that a direct tax\r\nof $20,000,000 per annum was apportioned among the States, and an\r\nincome tax of 3 per cent. on the excess of all incomes over $800 was\r\nprovided for; the first being made to take effect practically eight,\r\nand the second ten months after date of enactment. Such laws of course\r\ntook effect, and became immediately operative in the loyal States only,\r\nand produced but comparatively little revenue; and although the range\r\nof taxation was soon extended, the whole receipts from all sources by\r\nthe Government for the second year of the war, from excise, income,\r\nstamp, and all other internal taxes, were less than $42,000,000; and\r\nthat, too, at a time when the expenditures were in excess $60,000,000\r\nper month, or at the rate of over $700,000,000 per annum. And as\r\nshowing how novel was this whole subject of direct and internal\r\ntaxation to the people, and how completely the Government officials\r\nwere lacking in all experience in respect to it, the following incident\r\nmay be noted. The Secretary of the Treasury, in his report for 1863,\r\nstated that, with a view of determining his resources, he employed a\r\nvery competent person, with the aid of practical men, to estimate the\r\nprobable amount of revenue to be derived from each department of\r\ninternal taxation for the previous year. The estimate arrived at was\r\n$85,000,000, but the actual receipts were only $37,000,000.\"\r\n\r\nNow, no doubt, this might have happened under a Parliamentary\r\ngovernment. But, then, many members of Parliament, the entire\r\nOpposition in Parliament, would have been active to unravel the matter.\r\nAll the principles of finance would have been worked and propounded.\r\nThe light would have come from above, not from below--it would have\r\ncome from Parliament to the nation instead of from the nation to\r\nParliament But exactly the reverse happened in America. Mr. Wells goes\r\non to say:--\r\n\r\n\"The people of the loyal States were, however, more determined and in\r\nearnest in respect to this matter of taxation than were their rulers;\r\nand before long the popular discontent at the existing state of things\r\nwas openly manifest. Every where the opinion was expressed that\r\ntaxation in all possible forms should immediately, and to the largest\r\nextent, be made effective and imperative; and Congress spurred up, and\r\nright fully relying on public sentiment to sustain their action, at\r\nlast took up the matter resolutely and in earnest, and devised and\r\ninaugurated a system of internal and direct taxation, which for its\r\nuniversality and peculiarities has probably no parallel in anything\r\nwhich has heretofore been recorded in civil history, or is likely to be\r\nexperienced hereafter. The one necessity of the situation was revenue,\r\nand to obtain it speedily and in large amounts through taxation the\r\nonly principle recognised--if it can be called a principle--was akin to\r\nthat recommended to the traditionary Irishman on his visit to\r\nDonnybrook Fair, 'Wherever you see a head hit it'. Wherever you find an\r\narticle, a product, a trade, a profession, or a source of income, tax\r\nit! And so an edict went forth to this effect, and the people\r\ncheerfully submitted. Incomes under $5,000 were taxed 5 per cent., with\r\nan exemption of $600 and house rent actually paid; these exemptions\r\nbeing allowed on this ground, that they represented an amount\r\nsufficient at the time to enable a small family to procure the bare\r\nnecessaries of life, and thus take out from the operation of the law\r\nall those who were dependent upon each day's earnings to supply each\r\nday's needs. Incomes in excess of $5,000 and not in excess of $10,000\r\nwere taxed 2 1/2 per cent. in addition; and incomes over $10,000 5 per\r\ncent. additional, without any abeyance or exemptions whatever.\"\r\n\r\nNow this is all contrary to and worse than what would have happened\r\nunder a Parliamentary government. The delay to tax would not have\r\noccurred under it: the movement by the country to get taxation would\r\nnever have been necessary under it. The excessive taxation accordingly\r\nimposed would not have been permitted under it. The last point I think\r\nI need not labour at length. The evils of a bad tax are quite sure to\r\nbe pressed upon the ears of Parliament in season and out of season; the\r\nfew persons who have to pay it are thoroughly certain to make\r\nthemselves heard. The sort of taxation tried in America, that of taxing\r\neverything, and seeing what every thing would yield, could not have\r\nbeen tried under a Government delicately and quickly sensitive to\r\npublic opinion.\r\n\r\nI do not apologise for dwelling at length upon these points, for the\r\nsubject is one of transcendent importance. The practical choice of\r\nfirst-rate nations is between the Presidential government and the\r\nParliamentary; no State can be first-rate which has not a government by\r\ndiscussion, and those are the only two existing species of that\r\ngovernment. It is between them that a nation which has to choose its\r\ngovernment must choose. And nothing therefore can be more important\r\nthan to compare the two, and to decide upon the testimony of\r\nexperience, and by facts, which of them is the better.\r\n\r\nTHE POPLARS, WIMBLEDON:\r\n\r\nJune 20, 1872.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNO. II.\r\n\r\nTHE CABINET.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"On all great subjects,\" says Mr. Mill, \"much remains to be said,\" and\r\nof none is this more true than of the English Constitution. The\r\nliterature which has accumulated upon it is huge. But an observer who\r\nlooks at the living reality will wonder at the contrast to the paper\r\ndescription. He will see in the life much which is not in the books;\r\nand he will not find in the rough practice many refinements of the\r\nliterary theory.\r\n\r\nIt was natural--perhaps inevitable--that such an under growth of\r\nirrelevant ideas should gather round the British Constitution. Language\r\nis the tradition of nations; each generation describes what it sees,\r\nbut it uses words transmitted from the past. When a great entity like\r\nthe British Constitution has continued in connected outward sameness,\r\nbut hidden inner change, for many ages, every generation inherits a\r\nseries of inapt words--of maxims once true, but of which the truth is\r\nceasing or has ceased. As a man's family go on muttering in his\r\nmaturity incorrect phrases derived from a just observation of his early\r\nyouth, so, in the full activity of an historical constitution, its\r\nsubjects repeat phrases true in the time of their fathers, and\r\ninculcated by those fathers, but now true no longer. Or, if I may say\r\nso, an ancient and ever-altering constitution is like an old man who\r\nstill wears with attached fondness clothes in the fashion of his youth:\r\nwhat you see of him is the same; what you do not see is wholly altered.\r\n\r\nThere are two descriptions of the English Constitution which have\r\nexercised immense influence, but which are erroneous. First, it is laid\r\ndown as a principle of the English polity, that in it the legislative,\r\nthe executive, and the judicial powers are quite divided--that each is\r\nentrusted to a separate person or set of persons--that no one of these\r\ncan at all interfere with the work of the other. There has been much\r\neloquence expended in explaining how the rough genius of the English\r\npeople, even in the middle ages, when it was especially rude, carried\r\ninto life and practice that elaborate division of functions which\r\nphilosophers had suggested on paper, but which they had hardly hoped to\r\nsee except on paper.\r\n\r\nSecondly, it is insisted that the peculiar excellence of the British\r\nConstitution lies in a balanced union of three powers. It is said that\r\nthe monarchical element, the aristocratic element, and the democratic\r\nelement, have each a share in the supreme sovereignty, and that the\r\nassent of all three is necessary to the action of that sovereignty.\r\nKings, lords, and commons, by this theory, are alleged to be not only\r\nthe outward form, but the inner moving essence, the vitality of the\r\nConstitution. A great theory, called the theory of \"Checks and\r\nBalances,\" pervades an immense part of political literature, and much\r\nof it is collected from or supported by English experience. Monarchy,\r\nit is said, has some faults, some bad tendencies, aristocracy others,\r\ndemocracy, again, others; but England has shown that a Government can\r\nbe constructed in which these evil tendencies exactly check, balance,\r\nand destroy one another--in which a good whole is constructed not\r\nsimply in spite of, but by means of, the counteracting defects of the\r\nconstituent parts.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, it is believed that the principal characteristics of the\r\nEnglish Constitution are inapplicable in countries where the materials\r\nfor a monarchy or an aristocracy do not exist. That Constitution is\r\nconceived to be the best imaginable use of the political elements which\r\nthe great majority of States in modern Europe inherited from the\r\nmediaeval period. It is believed that out of these materials nothing\r\nbetter can be made than the English Constitution; but it is also\r\nbelieved that the essential parts of the English Constitution cannot be\r\nmade except from these materials. Now these elements are the accidents\r\nof a period and a region; they belong only to one or two centuries in\r\nhuman history, and to a few countries. The United States could not have\r\nbecome monarchical, even if the Constitutional Convention had decreed\r\nit, even if the component States had ratified it. The mystic reverence,\r\nthe religious allegiance, which are essential to a true monarchy, are\r\nimaginative sentiments that no legislature can manufacture in any\r\npeople. These semi-filial feelings in Government are inherited just as\r\nthe true filial feelings in common life. You might as well adopt a\r\nfather as make a monarchy: the special sentiment belonging to the one\r\nis as incapable of voluntary creation as the peculiar affection\r\nbelonging to the other. If the practical part of the English\r\nConstitution could only be made out of a curious accumulation of\r\nmediaeval materials, its interest would be half historical, and its\r\nimitability very confined.\r\n\r\nNo one can approach to an understanding of the English institutions, or\r\nof others, which, being the growth of many centuries, exercise a wide\r\nsway over mixed populations, unless he divide them into two classes. In\r\nsuch constitutions there are two parts (not indeed separable with\r\nmicroscopic accuracy, for the genius of great affairs abhors nicety of\r\ndivision): first, those which excite and preserve the reverence of the\r\npopulation--the DIGNIFIED parts, if I may so call them; and next, the\r\nEFFICIENT parts--those by which it, in fact, works and rules. There are\r\ntwo great objects which every constitution must attain to be\r\nsuccessful, which every old and celebrated one must have wonderfully\r\nachieved: every constitution must first GAIN authority, and then USE\r\nauthority; it must first win the loyalty and confidence of mankind, and\r\nthen employ that homage in the work of government.\r\n\r\nThere are indeed practical men who reject the dignified parts of\r\nGovernment. They say, we want only to attain results, to do business: a\r\nconstitution is a collection of political means for political ends, and\r\nif you admit that any part of a constitution does no business, or that\r\na simpler machine would do equally well what it does, you admit that\r\nthis part of the constitution, however dignified or awful it may be, is\r\nnevertheless in truth useless. And other reasoners, who distrust this\r\nbare philosophy, have propounded subtle arguments to prove that these\r\ndignified parts of old Governments are cardinal components of the\r\nessential apparatus, great pivots of substantial utility; and so they\r\nmanufactured fallacies which the plainer school have well exposed. But\r\nboth schools are in error. The dignified parts of Government are those\r\nwhich bring it force--which attract its motive power. The efficient\r\nparts only employ that power. The comely parts of a Government HAVE\r\nneed, for they are those upon which its vital strength depends. They\r\nmay not do anything definite that a simpler polity would not do better;\r\nbut they are the preliminaries, the needful prerequisites of ALL work.\r\nThey raise the army, though they do not win the battle.\r\n\r\nDoubtless, if all subjects of the same Government only thought of what\r\nwas useful to them, and if they all thought the same thing useful, and\r\nall thought that same thing could be attained in the same way, the\r\nefficient members of a constitution would suffice, and no impressive\r\nadjuncts would be needed. But the world in which we live is organised\r\nfar otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe most strange fact, though the most certain in nature, is the\r\nunequal development of the human race. If we look back to the early\r\nages of mankind, such as we seem in the faint distance to see them--if\r\nwe call up the image of those dismal tribes in lake villages, or on\r\nwretched beaches--scarcely equal to the commonest material needs,\r\ncutting down trees slowly and painfully with stone tools, hardly\r\nresisting the attacks of huge, fierce animals--without culture, without\r\nleisure, without poetry, almost without thought--destitute of morality,\r\nwith only a sort of magic for religion; and if we compare that imagined\r\nlife with the actual life of Europe now, we are overwhelmed at the wide\r\ncontrast--we can scarcely conceive ourselves to be of the same race as\r\nthose in the far distance. There used to be a notion--not so much\r\nwidely asserted as deeply implanted, rather pervadingly latent than\r\ncommonly apparent in political philosophy--that in a little while,\r\nperhaps ten years or so, all human beings might, without extraordinary\r\nappliances, be brought to the same level. But now, when we see by the\r\npainful history of mankind at what point we began, by what slow toil,\r\nwhat favourable circumstances, what accumulated achievements, civilised\r\nman has become at all worthy in any degree so to call himself--when we\r\nrealise the tedium of history and the painfulness of results--our\r\nperceptions are sharpened as to the relative steps of our long and\r\ngradual progress. We have in a great community like England crowds of\r\npeople scarcely more civilised than the majority of two thousand years\r\nago; we have others, even more numerous, such as the best people were a\r\nthousand years since. The lower orders, the middle orders, are still,\r\nwhen tried by what is the standard of the educated \"ten thousand,\"\r\nnarrow-minded, unintelligent, incurious. It is useless to pile up\r\nabstract words. Those who doubt should go out into their kitchens. Let\r\nan accomplished man try what seems to him most obvious, most certain,\r\nmost palpable in intellectual matters, upon the housemaid and the\r\nfootman, and he will find that what he says seems unintelligible,\r\nconfused, and erroneous--that his audience think him mad and wild when\r\nhe is speaking what is in his own sphere of thought the dullest\r\nplatitude of cautious soberness. Great communities are like great\r\nmountains--they have in them the primary, secondary, and tertiary\r\nstrata of human progress; the characteristics of the lower regions\r\nresemble the life of old times rather than the present life of the\r\nhigher regions. And a philosophy which does not ceaselessly remember,\r\nwhich does not continually obtrude, the palpable differences of the\r\nvarious parts, will be a theory radically false, because it has omitted\r\na capital reality--will be a theory essentially misleading, because it\r\nwill lead men to expect what does not exist, and not to anticipate that\r\nwhich they will find.\r\n\r\nEvery one knows these plain facts, but by no means every one has traced\r\ntheir political importance. When a State is constituted thus, it is not\r\ntrue that the lower classes will be wholly absorbed in the useful; on\r\nthe contrary, they do not like anything so poor. No orator ever made an\r\nimpression by appealing to men as to their plainest physical wants,\r\nexcept when he could allege that those wants were caused by some one's\r\ntyranny. But thousands have made the greatest impression by appealing\r\nto some vague dream of glory, or empire, or nationality. The ruder sort\r\nof men--that is, men at ONE stage of rudeness--will sacrifice all they\r\nhope for, all they have, THEMSELVES, for what is called an idea--for\r\nsome attraction which seems to transcend reality, which aspires to\r\nelevate men by an interest higher, deeper, wider than that of ordinary\r\nlife. But this order of men are uninterested in the plain, palpable\r\nends of government; they do not prize them; they do not in the least\r\ncomprehend how they should be attained. It is very natural, therefore,\r\nthat the most useful parts of the structure of government should by no\r\nmeans be those which excite the most reverence. The elements which\r\nexcite the most easy reverence will be the THEATRICAL elements--those\r\nwhich appeal to the senses, which claim to be embodiments of the\r\ngreatest human ideas, which boast in some cases of far more than human\r\norigin. That which is mystic in its claims; that which is occult in its\r\nmode of action; that which is brilliant to the eye; that which is seen\r\nvividly for a moment, and then is seen no more; that which is hidden\r\nand unhidden; that which is specious, and yet interesting, palpable in\r\nits seeming, and yet professing to be more than palpable in its\r\nresults; this, howsoever its form may change, or however we may define\r\nit or describe it, is the sort of thing--the only sort--which yet comes\r\nhome to the mass of men. So far from the dignified parts of a\r\nconstitution being necessarily the most useful, they are likely,\r\naccording to outside presumption, to be the least so; for they are\r\nlikely to be adjusted to the lowest orders--those likely to care least\r\nand judge worst about what IS useful.\r\n\r\nThere is another reason which, in an old constitution like that of\r\nEngland, is hardly less important. The most intellectual of men are\r\nmoved quite as much by the circumstances which they are used to as by\r\ntheir own will. The active voluntary part of a man is very small, and\r\nif it were not economised by a sleepy kind of habit, its results would\r\nbe null. We could not do every day out of our own heads all we have to\r\ndo. We should accomplish nothing, for all our energies would be\r\nfrittered away in minor attempts at petty improvement. One man, too,\r\nwould go off from the known track in one direction, and one in another;\r\nso that when a crisis came requiring massed combination, no two men\r\nwould be near enough to act together. It is the dull traditional habit\r\nof mankind that guides most men's actions, and is the steady frame in\r\nwhich each new artist must set the picture that he paints. And all this\r\ntraditional part of human nature is, ex vi termini, most easily\r\nimpressed and acted on by that which is handed down. Other things being\r\nequal, yesterday's institutions are by far the best for to-day; they\r\nare the most ready, the most influential, the most easy to get obeyed,\r\nthe most likely to retain the reverence which they alone inherit, and\r\nwhich every other must win. The most imposing institutions of mankind\r\nare the oldest; and yet so changing is the world, so fluctuating are\r\nits needs, so apt to lose inward force, though retaining out ward\r\nstrength, are its best instruments, that we must not expect the oldest\r\ninstitutions to be now the most efficient. We must expect what is\r\nvenerable to acquire influence because of its inherent dignity; but we\r\nmust not expect it to use that influence so well as new creations apt\r\nfor the modern world, instinct with its spirit, and fitting closely to\r\nits life.\r\n\r\nThe brief description of the characteristic merit of the English\r\nConstitution is, that its dignified parts are very complicated and\r\nsomewhat imposing, very old and rather venerable; while its efficient\r\npart, at least when in great and critical action, is decidedly simple\r\nand rather modern. We have made, or rather stumbled on, a constitution\r\nwhich--though full of every species of incidental defect, though of the\r\nworst workmanship in all out-of-the-way matters of any constitution in\r\nthe world--yet has two capital merits: it contains a simple efficient\r\npart which, on occasion, and when wanted, can work more simply and\r\neasily, and better, than any instrument of government that has yet been\r\ntried; and it contains likewise historical, complex, august, theatrical\r\nparts, which it has inherited from a long past--which take the\r\nmultitude--which guide by an insensible but an omnipotent influence the\r\nassociations of its subjects. Its essence is strong with the strength\r\nof modern simplicity; its exterior is august with the Gothic grandeur\r\nof a more imposing age. Its simple essence may, mutatis mutandis, be\r\ntransplanted to many very various countries, but its august\r\noutside--what most men think it is--is narrowly confined to nations\r\nwith an analogous history and similar political materials.\r\n\r\nThe efficient secret of the English Constitution may be described as\r\nthe close union, the nearly complete fusion, of the executive and\r\nlegislative powers. No doubt by the traditional theory, as it exists in\r\nall the books, the goodness of our constitution consists in the entire\r\nseparation of the legislative and executive authorities, but in truth\r\nits merit consists in their singular approximation. The connecting link\r\nis the Cabinet. By that new word we mean a committee of the legislative\r\nbody selected to be the executive body. The legislature has many\r\ncommittees, but this is its greatest. It chooses for this, its main\r\ncommittee, the men in whom it has most confidence. It does not, it is\r\ntrue, choose them directly; but it is nearly omnipotent in choosing\r\nthem indirectly. A century ago the Crown had a real choice of\r\nMinisters, though it had no longer a choice in policy. During the long\r\nreign of Sir R. Walpole he was obliged not only to manage Parliament\r\nbut to manage the palace. He was obliged to take care that some court\r\nintrigue did not expel him from his place. The nation then selected the\r\nEnglish policy, but the Crown chose the English Ministers. They were\r\nnot only in name, as now, but in fact, the Queen's servants. Remnants,\r\nimportant remnants, of this great prerogative still remain. The\r\ndiscriminating favour of William IV. made Lord Melbourne head of the\r\nWhig party when he was only one of several rivals. At the death of Lord\r\nPalmerston it is very likely that the Queen may have the opportunity of\r\nfairly choosing between two, if not three statesmen. But, as a rule,\r\nthe nominal Prime Minister is chosen by the legislature, and the real\r\nPrime Minister for most purposes--the leader of the House of\r\nCommons--almost without exception is so. There is nearly always some\r\none man plainly selected by the voice of the predominant party in the\r\npredominant house of the legislature to head that party, and\r\nconsequently to rule the nation. We have in England an elective first\r\nmagistrate as truly as the Americans have an elective first magistrate.\r\nThe Queen is only at the head of the dignified part of the\r\nConstitution. The Prime Minister is at the head of the efficient part.\r\nThe Crown is, according to the saying, the \"fountain of honour\"; but\r\nthe Treasury is the spring of business. Nevertheless, our first\r\nmagistrate differs from the American. He is not elected directly by the\r\npeople; he is elected by the representatives of the people. He is an\r\nexample of \"double election\". The legislature chosen, in name, to make\r\nlaws, in fact finds its principal business in making and in keeping an\r\nexecutive.\r\n\r\nThe leading Minister so selected has to choose his associates, but he\r\nonly chooses among a charmed circle. The position of most men in\r\nParliament forbids their being invited to the Cabinet; the position of\r\na few men ensures their being invited. Between the compulsory list whom\r\nhe must take, and the impossible list whom he cannot take, a Prime\r\nMinister's independent choice in the formation of a Cabinet is not very\r\nlarge; it extends rather to the division of the Cabinet offices than to\r\nthe choice of Cabinet Ministers. Parliament and the nation have pretty\r\nwell settled who shall have the first places; but they have not\r\ndiscriminated with the same accuracy which man shall have which place.\r\nThe highest patronage of a Prime Minister is, of course, a considerable\r\npower, though it is exercised under close and imperative\r\nrestrictions--though it is far less than it seems to be when stated in\r\ntheory, or looked at from a distance.\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet, in a word, is a board of control chosen by the\r\nlegislature, out of persons whom it trusts and knows, to rule the\r\nnation. The particular mode in which the English Ministers are\r\nselected; the fiction that they are, in any political sense, the\r\nQueen's servants; the rule which limits the choice of the Cabinet to\r\nthe members of the legislature--are accidents unessential to its\r\ndefinition--historical incidents separable from its nature. Its\r\ncharacteristic is that it should be chosen by the legislature out of\r\npersons agreeable to and trusted by the legislature. Naturally these\r\nare principally its own members--but they need not be exclusively so. A\r\nCabinet which included persons not members of the legislative assembly\r\nmight still perform all useful duties. Indeed the peers, who constitute\r\na large element in modern Cabinets, are members, now-a-days, only of a\r\nsubordinate assembly. The House of Lords still exercises several useful\r\nfunctions; but the ruling influence--the deciding faculty--has passed\r\nto what, using the language of old times, we still call the lower\r\nhouse--to an assembly which, though inferior as a dignified\r\ninstitution, is superior as an efficient institution. A principal\r\nadvantage of the House of Lords in the present age indeed consists in\r\nits thus acting as a reservoir of Cabinet Ministers. Unless the\r\ncomposition of the House of Commons were improved, or unless the rules\r\nrequiring Cabinet Ministers to be members of the legislature were\r\nrelaxed, it would undoubtedly be difficult to find, without the lords,\r\na sufficient supply of chief Ministers. But the detail of the\r\ncomposition of a Cabinet, and the precise method of its choice, are not\r\nto the purpose now. The first and cardinal consideration is the\r\ndefinition of a Cabinet. We must not bewilder ourselves with the\r\ninseparable accidents until we know the necessary essence. A Cabinet is\r\na combining committee--a hyphen which joins, a buckle which fastens,\r\nthe legislative part of the State to the executive part of the State.\r\nIn its origin it belongs to the one, in its functions it belongs to the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe most curious point about the Cabinet is that so very little is\r\nknown about it. The meetings are not only secret in theory, but secret\r\nin reality. By the present practice, no official minute in all ordinary\r\ncases is kept of them. Even a private note is discouraged and disliked.\r\nThe House of Commons, even in its most inquisitive and turbulent\r\nmoments, would scarcely permit a note of a Cabinet meeting to be read.\r\nNo Minister who respected the fundamental usages of political practice\r\nwould attempt to read such a note. The committee which unites the\r\nlaw-making power to the law-executing power--which, by virtue of that\r\ncombination, is, while it lasts and holds together, the most powerful\r\nbody in the State--is a committee wholly secret. No description of it,\r\nat once graphic and authentic, has ever been given. It is said to be\r\nsometimes like a rather disorderly board of directors, where many speak\r\nand few listen--though no one knows.[1] But a Cabinet, though it is a\r\ncommittee of the legislative assembly, is a committee with a power\r\nwhich no assembly would--unless for historical accidents, and after\r\nhappy experience--have been persuaded to entrust to any committee. It\r\nis a committee which can dissolve the assembly which appointed it; it\r\nis a committee with a suspensive veto--a committee with a power of\r\nappeal. Though appointed by one Parliament, it can appeal if it chooses\r\nto the next. Theoretically, indeed, the power to dissolve Parliament is\r\nentrusted to the sovereign only; and there are vestiges of doubt\r\nwhether in ALL cases a sovereign is bound to dissolve Parliament when\r\nthe Cabinet asks him to do so. But neglecting such small and dubious\r\nexceptions, the Cabinet which was chosen by one House of Commons has an\r\nappeal to the next House of Commons. The chief committee of the\r\nlegislature has the power of dissolving the predominant part of that\r\nlegislature--that which at a crisis is the supreme legislature. The\r\nEnglish system, therefore, is not an absorption of the executive power\r\nby the legislative power; it is a fusion of the two. Either the Cabinet\r\nlegislates and acts, or else it can dissolve. It is a creature, but it\r\nhas the power of destroying its creators. It is an executive which can\r\nannihilate the legislature, as well as an executive which is the\r\nnominee of the legislature. It was made, but it can unmake; it was\r\nderivative in its origin, but it is destructive in its action. This\r\nfusion of the legislative and executive functions may, to those who\r\nhave not much considered it, seem but a dry and small matter to be the\r\nlatent essence and effectual secret of the English Constitution; but we\r\ncan only judge of its real importance by looking at a few of its\r\nprincipal effects, and contrasting it very shortly with its great\r\ncompetitor, which seems likely, unless care be taken, to outstrip it in\r\nthe progress of the world. That competitor is the Presidential system.\r\nThe characteristic of it is that the President is elected from the\r\npeople by one process, and the House of Representatives by another. The\r\nindependence of the legislative and executive powers is the specific\r\nquality of Presidential government, just as their fusion and\r\ncombination is the precise principle of Cabinet government.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] It is said that at the end of the Cabinet which agreed to propose a\r\nfixed duty on corn, Lord Melbourne put his back to the door and said,\r\n\"Now is it to lower the price of corn or isn't it? It is not much\r\nmatter which we say, but mind, we must all say THE SAME.\" This is the\r\nmost graphic story of a Cabinet I ever heard, but I cannot vouch for\r\nits truth. Lord Melbourne's is a character about which men make stories.\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst, compare the two in quiet times. The essence of a civilised age\r\nis, that administration requires the continued aid of legislation. One\r\nprincipal and necessary kind of legislation is taxation. The expense of\r\ncivilised government is continually varying. It must vary if the\r\nGovernment does its duty. The miscellaneous estimates of the English\r\nGovernment contain an inevitable medley of changing items. Education,\r\nprison discipline, art, science, civil contingencies of a hundred\r\nkinds, require more money one year and less another. The expense of\r\ndefence--the naval and military estimates--vary still more as the\r\ndanger of attack seems more or less imminent, as the means of retarding\r\nsuch danger become more or less costly. If the persons who have to do\r\nthe work are not the same as those who have to make the laws, there\r\nwill be a controversy between the two sets of persons. The tax-imposers\r\nare sure to quarrel with the tax-requirers. The executive is crippled\r\nby not getting the laws it needs, and the legislature is spoiled by\r\nhaving to act without responsibility: the executive becomes unfit for\r\nits name, since it cannot execute what it decides on; the legislature\r\nis demoralised by liberty, by taking decisions of which others (and not\r\nitself) will suffer the effects.\r\n\r\nIn America so much has this difficulty been felt that a semi-connection\r\nhas grown up between the legislature and the executive. When the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury of the Federal Government wants a tax he\r\nconsults upon it with the chairman of the Financial Committee of\r\nCongress. He cannot go down to Congress himself and propose what he\r\nwants; he can only write a letter and send it. But he tries to get a\r\nchairman of the Finance Committee who likes his tax;--through that\r\nchairman he tries to persuade the committee to recommend such tax; by\r\nthat committee he tries to induce the house to adopt that tax. But such\r\na chain of communications is liable to continual interruptions; it may\r\nsuffice for a single tax on a fortunate occasion, but will scarcely\r\npass a complicated budget--we do not say in a war or a rebellion--we\r\nare now comparing the Cabinet system and the Presidential system in\r\nquiet times--but in times of financial difficulty. Two clever men never\r\nexactly agreed about a budget. We have by present practice an Indian\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer talking English finance at Calcutta, and an\r\nEnglish one talking Indian finance in England. But the figures are\r\nnever the same, and the views of policy are rarely the same. One most\r\nangry controversy has amused the world, and probably others scarcely\r\nless interesting are hidden in the copious stores of our Anglo-Indian\r\ncorrespondence.\r\n\r\nBut relations something like these must subsist between the head of a\r\nfinance committee in the legislature, and a finance Minister in the\r\nexecutive.[2] They are sure to quarrel, and the result is sure to\r\nsatisfy neither. And when the taxes do not yield as they were expected\r\nto yield, who is responsible? Very likely the Secretary of the Treasury\r\ncould not persuade the chairman--very likely the chairman could not\r\npersuade his committee--very likely the committee could not persuade\r\nthe assembly. Whom, then, can you punish--whom can you abolish--when\r\nyour taxes run short? There is nobody save the legislature, a vast\r\nmiscellaneous body difficult to punish, and the very persons to inflict\r\nthe punishment. Nor is the financial part of administration the only\r\none which requires in a civilised age the constant support and\r\naccompaniment of facilitating legislation. All administration does so.\r\nIn England, on a vital occasion, the Cabinet can compel legislation by\r\nthe threat of resignation, and the threat of dissolution; but neither\r\nof these can be used in a Presidential State. There the legislature\r\ncannot be dissolved by the executive Government; and it does not heed a\r\nresignation, for it has not to find the successor. Accordingly, when a\r\ndifference of opinion arises, the legislature is forced to fight the\r\nexecutive, and the executive is forced to fight the legislative; and so\r\nvery likely they contend to the conclusion of their respective\r\nterms.[3] There is, indeed, one condition of things in which this\r\ndescription, though still approximately true, is, nevertheless, not\r\nexactly true; and that is, when there is nothing to fight about. Before\r\nthe rebellion in America, owing to the vast distance of other States,\r\nand the favourable economic condition of the country, there were very\r\nfew considerable objects of contention; but if that government had been\r\ntried by English legislation of the last thirty years, the discordant\r\naction of the two powers, whose constant cooperation is essential to\r\nthe best government, would have shown itself much more distinctly. Nor\r\nis this the worst. Cabinet government educates the nation; the\r\nPresidential does not educate it, and may corrupt it. It has been said\r\nthat England invented the phrase, \"Her Majesty's Opposition\"; that it\r\nwas the first Government which made a criticism of administration as\r\nmuch a part of the polity as administration itself. This critical\r\nopposition is the consequence of Cabinet government. The great scene of\r\ndebate, the great engine of popular instruction and political\r\ncontroversy, is the legislative assembly. A speech there by an eminent\r\nstatesman, a party movement by a great political combination, are the\r\nbest means yet known for arousing, enlivening, and teaching a people.\r\nThe Cabinet system ensures such debates, for it makes them the means by\r\nwhich statesmen advertise themselves for future and confirm themselves\r\nin present Governments. It brings forward men eager to speak, and gives\r\nthem occasions to speak. The deciding catastrophes of Cabinet\r\ngovernments are critical divisions preceded by fine discussions.\r\nEverything which is worth saying, everything which ought to be said,\r\nmost certainly WILL be said. Conscientious men think they ought to\r\npersuade others; selfish men think they would like to obtrude\r\nthemselves. The nation is forced to hear two sides--all the sides,\r\nperhaps, of that which most concerns it. And it likes to hear--it is\r\neager to know. Human nature despises long arguments which come to\r\nnothing--heavy speeches which precede no motion--abstract disquisitions\r\nwhich leave visible things where they were. But all men heed great\r\nresults, and a change of Government is a great result. It has a hundred\r\nramifications; it runs through society; it gives hope to many, and it\r\ntakes away hope from many. It is one of those marked events which, by\r\nits magnitude and its melodrama, impress men even too much. And debates\r\nwhich have this catastrophe at the end of them--or may so have it--are\r\nsure to be listened to, and sure to sink deep into the national mind.\r\nTravellers even in the Northern States of America, the greatest and\r\nbest of Presidential countries, have noticed that the nation was \"not\r\nspecially addicted to politics\"; that they have not a public opinion\r\nfinished and chastened as that of the English has been finished and\r\nchastened. A great many hasty writers have charged this defect on the\r\n\"Yankee race,\" on the Anglo-American character; but English people, if\r\nthey had no motive to attend to politics, certainly would not attend to\r\npolitics. At present there is BUSINESS in their attention. They assist\r\nat the determining crisis; they arrest or help it. Whether the\r\nGovernment will go out or remain is determined by the debate, and by\r\nthe division in Parliament. And the opinion out of doors, the secret\r\npervading disposition of society, has a great influence on that\r\ndivision. The nation feels that its judgment is important, and it\r\nstrives to judge. It succeeds in deciding because the debates and the\r\ndiscussions give it the facts and the arguments. But under a\r\nPresidential government, a nation has, except at the electing moment,\r\nno influence; it has not the ballot-box before it; its virtue is gone,\r\nand it must wait till its instant of despotism again returns. It is not\r\nincited to form an opinion like a nation under a Cabinet government;\r\nnor is it instructed like such a nation. There are doubtless debates in\r\nthe legislature, but they are prologues without a play. There is\r\nnothing of a catastrophe about them; you can not turn out the\r\nGovernment. The prize of power is not in the gift of the legislature,\r\nand no one cares for the legislature. The executive, the great centre\r\nof power and place, sticks irremovable; you cannot change it in any\r\nevent. The teaching apparatus which has educated our public mind, which\r\nprepares our resolutions, which shapes our opinions, does not exist. No\r\nPresidential country needs to form daily delicate opinions, or is\r\nhelped in forming them. It might be thought that the discussions in the\r\npress would supply the deficiencies in the Constitution; that by a\r\nreading people especially, the conduct of their Government would be as\r\ncarefully watched, that their opinions about it would be as consistent,\r\nas accurate, as well considered, under a Presidential as under a\r\nCabinet polity. But the same difficulty oppresses the press which\r\noppresses the legislature. It can DO NOTHING. It cannot change the\r\nadministration; the executive was elected for such and such years, and\r\nfor such and such years it must last. People wonder that so literary a\r\npeople as the Americans--a people who read more than any people who\r\never lived, who read so many newspapers--should have such bad\r\nnewspapers. The papers are not so good as the English, because they\r\nhave not the same motive to be good as the English papers. At a\r\npolitical \"crisis,\" as we say--that is, when the fate of an\r\nadministration is unfixed, when it depends on a few votes yet\r\nunsettled, upon a wavering and veering opinion--effective articles in\r\ngreat journals become of essential moment. The Times has made many\r\nministries. When, as of late, there has been a long continuance of\r\ndivided Parliaments, of Governments which were without \"brute voting\r\npower,\" and which depended on intellectual strength, the support of the\r\nmost influential organ of English opinion has been of critical moment.\r\nIf a Washington newspaper could have turned out Mr. Lincoln, there\r\nwould have been good writing and fine argument in the Washington\r\nnewspapers. But the Washington newspapers can no more remove a\r\nPresident during his term of place than the Times can remove a lord\r\nmayor during his year of office. Nobody cares for a debate in Congress\r\nwhich \"comes to nothing,\" and no one reads long articles which have no\r\ninfluence on events. The Americans glance at the heads of news, and\r\nthrough the paper. They do not enter upon a discussion. They do not\r\nthink of entering upon a discussion which would be useless.\r\n\r\n\r\n[2] It is worth observing that even during the short existence of the\r\nConfederate Government these evils distinctly showed themselves. Almost\r\nthe last incident at the Richmond Congress was an angry financial\r\ncorrespondence with Jefferson Davis.\r\n\r\n[3] I leave this passage to stand as it was written, just after the\r\nassassination of Mr. Lincoln, and when every one said Mr. Johnson would\r\nbe very hostile to the South.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter saying that the division of the legislature and the executive in\r\nPresidential governments weakens the legislative power, it may seem a\r\ncontradiction to say that it also weakens the executive power. But it\r\nis not a contradiction. The division weakens the whole aggregate force\r\nof Government--the entire imperial power; and therefore it weakens both\r\nits halves. The executive is weakened in a very plain way. In England a\r\nstrong Cabinet can obtain the concurrence of the legislature in all\r\nacts which facilitate its administration; it is itself, so to say, the\r\nlegislature. But a President may be hampered by the Parliament, and is\r\nlikely to be hampered. The natural tendency of the members of every\r\nlegislature is to make themselves conspicuous. They wish to gratify an\r\nambition laudable or blamable; they wish to promote the measures they\r\nthink best for the public welfare; they wish to make their WILL felt in\r\ngreat affairs. All these mixed motives urge them to oppose the\r\nexecutive. They are embodying the purposes of others if they aid; they\r\nare advancing their own opinions if they defeat: they are first if they\r\nvanquish; they are auxiliaries if they support. The weakness of the\r\nAmerican executive used to be the great theme of all critics before the\r\nConfederate rebellion. Congress and committees of Congress of course\r\nimpeded the executive when there was no coercive public sentiment to\r\ncheck and rule them.\r\n\r\nBut the Presidential system not only gives the executive power an\r\nantagonist in the legislative power, and so makes it weaker; it also\r\nenfeebles it by impairing its intrinsic quality. A Cabinet is elected\r\nby a legislature; and when that legislature is composed of fit persons,\r\nthat mode of electing the executive is the very best. It is a case of\r\nsecondary election, under the only conditions in which secondary\r\nelection is preferable to primary. Generally speaking, in an\r\nelectioneering country (I mean in a country full of political life, and\r\nused to the manipulation of popular institutions), the election of\r\ncandidates to elect candidates is a farce. The Electoral College of\r\nAmerica is so. It was intended that the deputies when assembled should\r\nexercise a real discretion, and by independent choice select the\r\nPresident. But the primary electors take too much interest. They only\r\nelect a deputy to vote for Mr. Lincoln or Mr. Breckenridge, and the\r\ndeputy only takes a ticket, and drops that ticket in an urn. He never\r\nchooses or thinks of choosing. He is but a messenger--a transmitter;\r\nthe real decision is in those who choose him--who chose him because\r\nthey knew what he would do. It is true that the British House of\r\nCommons is subject to the same influences. Members are mostly, perhaps,\r\nelected because they will vote for a particular Ministry, rather than\r\nfor purely legislative reasons. But--and here is the capital\r\ndistinction--the functions of the House of Commons are important and\r\nCONTINUOUS. It does not, like the Electoral College in the United\r\nStates, separate when it has elected its ruler; it watches, legislates,\r\nseats and unseats ministries, from day to day. Accordingly it is a REAL\r\nelectoral body. The Parliament of 1857, which, more than any other\r\nParliament of late years, was a Parliament elected to support a\r\nparticular premier--which was chosen, as Americans might say, upon the\r\n\"Palmerston ticket\"--before it had been in existence two years,\r\ndethroned Lord Palmerston. Though selected in the interest of a\r\nparticular Ministry, it in fact destroyed that Ministry. A good\r\nParliament, too, is a capital choosing body. If it is fit to make laws\r\nfor a country, its majority ought to represent the general average\r\nintelligence of that country; its various members ought to represent\r\nthe various special interests, special opinions, special prejudices, to\r\nbe found in that community. There ought to be an advocate for every\r\nparticular sect, and a vast neutral body of no sect--homogeneous and\r\njudicial, like the nation itself. Such a body, when possible, is the\r\nbest selector of executives that can be imagined. It is full of\r\npolitical activity; it is close to political life; it feels the\r\nresponsibility of affairs which are brought as it were to its\r\nthreshold; it has as much intelligence as the society in question\r\nchances to contain. It is, what Washington and Hamilton strove to\r\ncreate, an electoral college of the picked men of the nation. The best\r\nmode of appreciating its advantages is to look at the alternative. The\r\ncompeting constituency is the nation itself, and this is, according to\r\ntheory and experience, in all but the rarest cases, a bad constituency.\r\nMr. Lincoln, at his second election, being elected when all the Federal\r\nStates had set their united hearts on one single object, was\r\nvoluntarily reelected by an actually choosing nation. He embodied the\r\nobject in which every one was absorbed. But this is almost the only\r\nPresidential election of which so much can be said. In almost all cases\r\nthe President is chosen by a machinery of caucuses and combinations too\r\ncomplicated to be perfectly known, and too familiar to require\r\ndescription. He is not the choice of the nation, he is the choice of\r\nthe wire-pullers. A very large constituency in quiet times is the\r\nnecessary, almost the legitimate, subject of electioneering management:\r\na man cannot know that he does not throw his vote away except he votes\r\nas part of some great organisation; and if he votes as a part, he\r\nabdicates his electoral function in favour of the managers of that\r\nassociation. The nation, even if it chose for itself, would, in some\r\ndegree, be an unskilled body; but when it does not choose for itself,\r\nbut only as latent agitators wish, it is like a large, lazy man, with a\r\nsmall vicious mind,--it moves slowly and heavily, but it moves at the\r\nbidding of a bad intention; it \"means LITTLE, but it means that little\r\nILL.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, as the nation is less able to choose than a Parliament, so it has\r\nworse people to choose out of. The American legislators of the last\r\ncentury have been much blamed for not permitting the Ministers of the\r\nPresident to be members of the assembly; but, with reference to the\r\nspecific end which they had in view, they saw clearly and decided\r\nwisely. They wished to keep \"the legislative branch absolutely distinct\r\nfrom the executive branch\"; they believed such a separation to be\r\nessential to a good constitution; they believed such a separation to\r\nexist in the English, which the wisest of them thought the best\r\nConstitution. And, to the effectual maintenance of such a separation,\r\nthe exclusion of the President's Ministers from the legislature is\r\nessential. If they are not excluded they become the executive, they\r\neclipse the President himself. A legislative chamber is greedy and\r\ncovetous; it acquires as much, it concedes as little as possible. The\r\npassions of its members are its rulers; the law-making faculty, the\r\nmost comprehensive of the imperial faculties, is its instrument; it\r\nwill take the administration if it can take it. Tried by their own\r\naims, the founders of the United States were wise in excluding the\r\nMinisters from Congress.\r\n\r\nBut though this exclusion is essential to the Presidential system of\r\ngovernment, it is not for that reason a small evil. It causes the\r\ndegradation of public life. Unless a member of the legislature be sure\r\nof something more than speech, unless he is incited by the hope of\r\naction, and chastened by the chance of responsibility, a first-rate man\r\nwill not care to take the place, and will not do much if he does take\r\nit. To belong to a debating society adhering to an executive (and this\r\nis no inapt description of a congress under a Presidential\r\nConstitution) is not an object to stir a noble ambition, and is a\r\nposition to encourage idleness. The members of a Parliament excluded\r\nfrom office can never be comparable, much less equal, to those of a\r\nParliament not excluded from office. The Presidential Government, by\r\nits nature, divides political life into two halves, an executive half\r\nand a legislative half; and, by so dividing it, makes neither half\r\nworth a man's having--worth his making it a continuous career--worthy\r\nto absorb, as Cabinet government absorbs, his whole soul. The statesmen\r\nfrom whom a nation chooses under a Presidential system are much\r\ninferior to those from whom it chooses under a Cabinet system, while\r\nthe selecting apparatus is also far less discerning.\r\n\r\nAll these differences are more important at critical periods, because\r\ngovernment itself is more important. A formed public opinion, a\r\nrespectable, able, and disciplined legislature, a well-chosen\r\nexecutive, a Parliament and an administration not thwarting each other,\r\nbut co-operating with each other, are of greater consequence when great\r\naffairs are in progress than when small affairs are in progress-when\r\nthere is much to do than when there is little to do. But in addition to\r\nthis, a Parliamentary or Cabinet Constitution possesses an additional\r\nand special advantage in very dangerous times. It has what we may call\r\na reserve of power fit for and needed by extreme exigencies.\r\n\r\nThe principle of popular government is that the supreme power, the\r\ndetermining efficacy in matters political, resides in the people--not\r\nnecessarily or commonly in the whole people, in the numerical majority,\r\nbut in a CHOSEN people, a picked and selected people. It is so in\r\nEngland; it is so in all free countries. Under a Cabinet Constitution\r\nat a sudden emergency this people can choose a ruler for the occasion.\r\nIt is quite possible and even likely that he would not be ruler before\r\nthe occasion. The great qualities, the imperious will, the rapid\r\nenergy, the eager nature fit for a great crisis are not required--are\r\nimpediments--in common times; A Lord Liverpool is better in everyday\r\npolitics than a Chatham--a Louis Philippe far better than a Napoleon.\r\nBy the structure of the world we often want, at the sudden occurrence\r\nof a grave tempest, to change the helmsman--to replace the pilot of the\r\ncalm by the pilot of the storm. In England we have had so few\r\ncatastrophes since our Constitution attained maturity, that we hardly\r\nappreciate this latent excellence. We have not needed a Cavour to rule\r\na revolution--a representative man above all men fit for a great\r\noccasion, and by a natural legal mode brought in to rule. But even in\r\nEngland, at what was the nearest to a great sudden crisis which we have\r\nhad of late years--at the Crimean difficulty--we used this inherent\r\npower. We abolished the Aberdeen Cabinet, the ablest we have had,\r\nperhaps, since the Reform Act--a Cabinet not only adapted, but\r\neminently adapted, for every sort of difficulty save the one it had to\r\nmeet--which abounded in pacific discretion, and was wanting only in the\r\n\"daemonic element\"; we chose a statesman, who had the sort of merit\r\nthen wanted, who, when he feels the steady power of England behind him,\r\nwill advance without reluctance, and will strike without restraint. As\r\nwas said at the time, \"We turned out the Quaker, and put in the\r\npugilist\".\r\n\r\nBut under a Presidential government you can do nothing of the kind. The\r\nAmerican Government calls itself a Government of the supreme people;\r\nbut at a quick crisis, the time when a sovereign power is most needed,\r\nyou cannot FIND the supreme people. You have got a Congress elected for\r\none fixed period, going out perhaps by fixed instalments, which cannot\r\nbe accelerated or retarded--you have a President chosen for a fixed\r\nperiod, and immovable during that period: all the arrangements are for\r\nSTATED times. There is no ELASTIC element, everything is rigid,\r\nspecified, dated. Come what may, you can quicken nothing, and can\r\nretard nothing. You have bespoken your Government in advance, and\r\nwhether it suits you or not, whether it works well or works ill,\r\nwhether it is what you want or not, by law you must keep it. In a\r\ncountry of complex foreign relations it would mostly happen that the\r\nfirst and most critical year of every war would be managed by a peace\r\nPremier, and the first and most critical years of peace by a war\r\nPremier. In each case the period of transition would be irrevocably\r\ngoverned by a man selected not for what he was to introduce, but what\r\nhe was to change--for the policy he was to abandon, not for the policy\r\nhe was to administer.\r\n\r\nThe whole history of the American Civil War--a history which has thrown\r\nan intense light on the working of a Presidential government at the\r\ntime when government is most important--is but a vast continuous\r\ncommentary on these reflections. It would, indeed, be absurd to press\r\nagainst Presidential government AS SUCH the singular defect by which\r\nVice-President Johnson has become President--by which a man elected to\r\na sinecure is fixed in what is for the moment the most important\r\nadministrative part in the political world. This defect, though most\r\ncharacteristic of the expectations[4] of the framers of the\r\nConstitution and of its working, is but an accident of this particular\r\ncase of Presidential government, and no necessary ingredient in that\r\ngovernment itself. But the first election of Mr. Lincoln is liable to\r\nno such objection. It was a characteristic instance of the natural\r\nworking of such a government upon a great occasion. And what was that\r\nworking? It may be summed up--it was government by an UNKNOWN QUANTITY.\r\nHardly any one in America had any living idea what Mr. Lincoln was\r\nlike, or any definite notion what he would do. The leading statesmen\r\nunder the system of Cabinet government are not only household words,\r\nbut household IDEAS. A conception, not, perhaps, in all respects a true\r\nbut a most vivid conception of what Mr. Gladstone is like, or what Lord\r\nPalmerston is like, runs through society. We have simply no notion what\r\nit would be to be left with the visible sovereignty in the hands of an\r\nunknown man. The notion of employing a man of unknown smallness at a\r\ncrisis of unknown greatness is to our minds simply ludicrous. Mr.\r\nLincoln, it is true, happened to be a man, if not of eminent ability,\r\nyet of eminent justness. There was an inner depth of Puritan nature\r\nwhich came out under suffering, and was very attractive. But success in\r\na lottery is no argument for lotteries. What were the chances against a\r\nperson of Lincoln's antecedents, elected as he was, proving to be what\r\nhe was? Such an incident is, however, natural to a Presidential\r\ngovernment. The President is elected by processes which forbid the\r\nelection of known men, except at peculiar conjunctures, and in moments\r\nwhen public opinion is excited and despotic; and consequently if a\r\ncrisis comes upon us soon after he is elected, inevitably we have\r\ngovernment by an unknown quantity--the superintendence of that crisis\r\nby what our great satirist would have called \"Statesman X\". Even in\r\nquiet times, government by a President, is, for the several various\r\nreasons which have been stated, inferior to government by a Cabinet;\r\nbut the difficulty of quiet times is nothing as compared with the\r\ndifficulty of unquiet times. The comparative deficiencies of the\r\nregular, common operation of a Presidential government are far less\r\nthan the comparative deficiencies in time of sudden trouble--the want\r\nof elasticity, the impossibility of a dictatorship, the total absence\r\nof a REVOLUTIONARY RESERVE. This contrast explains why the\r\ncharacteristic quality of Cabinet Governments--the fusion of the\r\nexecutive power with the legislative power--is of such cardinal\r\nimportance. I shall proceed to show under what form and with what\r\nadjuncts it exists in England.\r\n\r\n\r\n[4] The framers of the Constitution expected that the vice-president\r\nwould be elected by the Electoral College as the second wisest man in\r\nthe country. The vice-presidentship being a sinecure, a second-rate man\r\nagreeable to the wire-pullers is always smuggled in. The chance of\r\nsuccession to the presidentship is too distant to be thought of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNO. III.\r\n\r\nTHE MONARCHY.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nThe use of the Queen, in a dignified capacity, is incalculable. Without\r\nher in England, the present English Government would fail and pass\r\naway. Most people when they read that the Queen walked on the slopes at\r\nWindsor--that the Prince of Wales went to the Derby--have imagined that\r\ntoo much thought and prominence were given to little things. But they\r\nhave been in error; and it is nice to trace how the actions of a\r\nretired widow and an unemployed youth become of such importance.\r\n\r\nThe best reason why Monarchy is a strong government is, that it is an\r\nintelligible government. The mass of mankind understand it, and they\r\nhardly anywhere in the world understand any other. It is often said\r\nthat men are ruled by their imaginations; but it would be truer to say\r\nthey are governed by the weakness of their imaginations. The nature of\r\na constitution, the action of an assembly, the play of parties, the\r\nunseen formation of a guiding opinion, are complex facts, difficult to\r\nknow and easy to mistake. But the action of a single will, the fiat of\r\na single mind, are easy ideas: anybody can make them out, and no one\r\ncan ever forget them. When you put before the mass of mankind the\r\nquestion, \"Will you be governed by a king, or will you be governed by a\r\nconstitution?\" the inquiry comes out thus--\"Will you be governed in a\r\nway you understand, or will you be governed in a way you do not\r\nunderstand?\" The issue was put to the French people; they were asked,\r\n\"Will you be governed by Louis Napoleon, or will you be governed by an\r\nassembly?\" The French people said, \"We will be governed by the one man\r\nwe can imagine, and not by the many people we cannot imagine\".\r\n\r\nThe best mode of comprehending the nature of the two Governments, is to\r\nlook at a country in which the two have within a comparatively short\r\nspace of years succeeded each other.\r\n\r\n\"The political condition,\" says Mr. Grote, \"which Grecian legend\r\neverywhere presents to us, is in its principal features strikingly\r\ndifferent from that which had become universally prevalent among the\r\nGreeks in the time of the Peloponnesian War. Historical oligarchy, as\r\nwell as democracy, agreed in requiring a certain established system of\r\ngovernment, comprising the three elements of specialised functions,\r\ntemporary functionaries, and ultimate responsibility (under some forms\r\nor other) to the mass of qualified citizens--either a Senate or an\r\nEcclesia, or both. There were, of course, many and capital distinctions\r\nbetween one Government and another, in respect to the qualification of\r\nthe citizen, the attributes and efficiency of the general assembly, the\r\nadmissibility to power, etc.; and men might often be dissatisfied with\r\nthe way in which these questions were determined in their own city. But\r\nin the mind of every man, some determining rule or system--something\r\nlike what in modern times is called a CONSTITUTION--was indispensable\r\nto any Government entitled to be called legitimate, or capable of\r\ncreating in the mind of a Greek a feeling of moral obligation to obey\r\nit. The functionaries who exercise authority under it might be more or\r\nless competent or popular; but his personal feelings towards them were\r\ncommonly lost in his attachment or aversion to the general system. If\r\nany energetic man could by audacity or craft break down the\r\nConstitution, and render himself permanent ruler according to his own\r\nwill and pleasure, even though he might govern well, he could never\r\ninspire the people with any sentiment of duty towards him: his sceptre\r\nwas illegitimate from the beginning, and even the taking of his life,\r\nfar from being interdicted by that moral feeling which condemned the\r\nshedding of blood in other cases, was considered meritorious: he could\r\nnot even be mentioned in the language except by a name (_tyrannos_,\r\ndespot) which branded him as an object of mingled fear and dislike.\r\n\r\n\"If we carry our eyes back from historical to legendary Greece, we find\r\na picture the reverse of what has been here sketched. We discern a\r\ngovernment in which there is little or no scheme or system, still less\r\nany idea of responsibility to the governed, but in which the mainspring\r\nof obedience on the part of the people consists in their personal\r\nfeeling and reverence towards the chief. We remark, first and foremost,\r\nthe King; next, a limited number of subordinate kings or chiefs;\r\nafterwards, the mass of armed freemen, husbandmen, artisans,\r\nfreebooters, &c.; lowest of all, the free labourers for hire and the\r\nbought slaves. The King is not distinguished by any broad, or\r\nimpassable boundary from the other chiefs, to each of whom the title\r\nBasileus is applicable as well as to himself: his supremacy has been\r\ninherited from his ancestors, and passes by inheritance, as a general\r\nrule, to his eldest son, having been conferred upon the family as a\r\nprivilege by the favour of Zeus. In war, he is the leader, foremost in\r\npersonal prowess, and directing all military movements; in peace, he is\r\nthe general protector of the injured and oppressed; he offers up\r\nmoreover those public prayers and sacrifices which are intended to\r\nobtain for the whole people the favour of the gods. An ample domain is\r\nassigned to him as an appurtenance of his lofty position, and the\r\nproduce of his fields and his cattle is consecrated in part to an\r\nabundant, though rude hospitality. Moreover he receives frequent\r\npresents, to avert his enmity, to conciliate his favour, or to buy off\r\nhis exactions; and when plunder is taken from the enemy, a large\r\nprevious share, comprising probably the most alluring female captive,\r\nis reserved for him apart from the general distribution.\r\n\r\n\"Such is the position of the King in the heroic times of Greece--the\r\nonly person (if we except the herald, and priests, each both special\r\nand subordinate) who is then presented to us as clothed with any\r\nindividual authority--the person by whom all the executive functions,\r\nthen few in number, which the society requires, are either performed or\r\ndirected. His personal ascendancy--derived from Divine countenance\r\nbestowed both upon himself individually and upon his race, and probably\r\nfrom accredited Divine descent--is the salient feature in the picture:\r\nthe people hearken to his voice, embrace his propositions, and obey his\r\norders: not merely resistance, but even criticism upon his acts, is\r\ngenerally exhibited in an odious point of view, and is indeed never\r\nheard of except from some one or more of the subordinate princes.\"\r\n\r\nThe characteristic of the English Monarchy is that it retains the\r\nfeelings by which the heroic kings governed their rude age, and has\r\nadded the feelings by which the Constitutions of later Greece ruled in\r\nmore refined ages. We are a more mixed people than the Athenians, or\r\nprobably than any political Greeks. We have progressed more unequally.\r\nThe slaves in ancient times were a separate order; not ruled by the\r\nsame laws, or thoughts, as other men. It was not necessary to think of\r\nthem in making a constitution: it was not necessary to improve them in\r\norder to make a constitution possible. The Greek legislator had not to\r\ncombine in his polity men like the labourers of Somersetshire, and men\r\nlike Mr. Grote. He had not to deal with a community in which primitive\r\nbarbarism lay as a recognised basis to acquired civilisation. WE HAVE.\r\nWe have no slaves to keep down by special terrors and independent\r\nlegislation. But we have whole classes unable to comprehend the idea of\r\na constitution--unable to feel the least attachment to impersonal laws.\r\nMost do indeed vaguely know that there are some other institutions\r\nbesides the Queen, and some rules by which she governs. But a vast\r\nnumber like their minds to dwell more upon her than upon anything else,\r\nand therefore she is inestimable. A republic has only difficult ideas\r\nin government; a Constitutional Monarchy has an easy idea too; it has a\r\ncomprehensible element for the vacant many, as well as complex laws and\r\nnotions for the inquiring few.\r\n\r\nA FAMILY on the throne is an interesting idea also. It brings down the\r\npride of sovereignty to the level of petty life. No feeling could seem\r\nmore childish than the enthusiasm of the English at the marriage of the\r\nPrince of Wales. They treated as a great political event, what, looked\r\nat as a matter of pure business, was very small indeed. But no feeling\r\ncould be more like common human nature as it is, and as it is likely to\r\nbe. The women--one half the human race at least--care fifty times more\r\nfor a marriage than a ministry. All but a few cynics like to see a\r\npretty novel touching for a moment the dry scenes of the grave world. A\r\nprincely marriage is the brilliant edition of a universal fact, and, as\r\nsuch, it rivets mankind. We smile at the Court Circular; but remember\r\nhow many people read the Court Circular! Its use is not in what it\r\nsays, but in those to whom it speaks. They say that the Americans were\r\nmore pleased at the Queen's letter to Mrs. Lincoln, than at any act of\r\nthe English Government. It was a spontaneous act of intelligible\r\nfeeling in the midst of confused and tiresome business. Just so a royal\r\nfamily sweetens politics by the seasonable addition of nice and pretty\r\nevents. It introduces irrelevant facts into the business of government,\r\nbut they are facts which speak to \"men's bosoms\" and employ their\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\nTo state the matter shortly, royalty is a government in which the\r\nattention of the nation is concentrated on one person doing interesting\r\nactions. A Republic is a government in which that attention is divided\r\nbetween many, who are all doing uninteresting actions. Accordingly, so\r\nlong as the human heart is strong and the human reason weak, royalty\r\nwill be strong because it appeals to diffused feeling, and Republics\r\nweak because they appeal to the understanding.\r\n\r\nSecondly. The English Monarchy strengthens our Government with the\r\nstrength of religion. It is not easy to say why it should be so. Every\r\ninstructed theologian would say that it was the duty of a person born\r\nunder a Republic as much to obey that Republic as it is the duty of one\r\nborn under a Monarchy to obey the monarch. But the mass of the English\r\npeople do not think so; they agree with the oath of allegiance; they\r\nsay it is their duty to obey the \"Queen,\" and they have but hazy\r\nnotions as to obeying laws without a queen. In former times, when our\r\nConstitution was incomplete, this notion of local holiness in one part\r\nwas mischievous. All parts were struggling, and it was necessary each\r\nshould have its full growth. But superstition said one should grow\r\nwhere it would, and no other part should grow without its leave. The\r\nwhole cavalier party said it was their duty to obey the king, whatever\r\nthe king did. There was to be \"passive obedience\" to him, and there was\r\nno religious obedience due to any one else. He was the \"Lord's\r\nanointed,\" and no one else had been anointed at all. The Parliament,\r\nthe laws, the press were human institutions; but the Monarchy was a\r\nDivine institution. An undue advantage was given to a part of the\r\nConstitution, and therefore the progress of the whole was stayed.\r\n\r\nAfter the Revolution this mischievous sentiment was much weaker. The\r\nchange of the line of sovereigns was at first conclusive, If there was\r\na mystic right in any one, that right was plainly in James II.; if it\r\nwas an English duty to obey any one whatever he did, he was the person\r\nto be so obeyed; if there was an inherent inherited claim in any king,\r\nit was in the Stuart king to whom the crown had come by descent, and\r\nnot in the Revolution king to whom it had come by vote of Parliament.\r\nAll through the reign of William III. there was (in common speech) one\r\nking whom man had made, and another king whom God had made. The king\r\nwho ruled had no consecrated loyalty to build upon; although he ruled\r\nin fact, according to sacred theory there was a king in France who\r\nought to rule. But it was very hard for the English people, with their\r\nplain sense and slow imagination, to keep up a strong sentiment of\r\nveneration for a foreign adventurer. He lived under the protection of a\r\nFrench king; what he did was commonly stupid, and what he left undone\r\nwas very often wise. As soon as Queen Anne began to reign there was a\r\nchange of feeling; the old sacred sentiment began to cohere about her.\r\nThere were indeed difficulties which would have baffled most people;\r\nbut an Englishman whose heart is in a matter is not easily baffled.\r\nQueen Anne had a brother living and a father living, and by every rule\r\nof descent, their right was better than hers. But many people evaded\r\nboth claims. They said James II. had \"run away,\" and so abdicated,\r\nthough he only ran away because he was in duresse and was frightened,\r\nand though he claimed the allegiance of his subjects day by day. The\r\nPretender, it was said, was not legitimate, though the birth was proved\r\nby evidence which any Court of Justice would have accepted. The English\r\npeople were \"out of\" a sacred monarch, and so they tried very hard to\r\nmake a new one. Events, however, were too strong for them. They were\r\nready and eager to take Queen Anne as the stock of a new dynasty; they\r\nwere ready to ignore the claims of her father and the claims of her\r\nbrother, but they could not ignore the fact that at the critical period\r\nshe had no children. She had once had thirteen, but they all died in\r\nher lifetime, and it was necessary either to revert to the Stuarts or\r\nto make a new king by Act of Parliament.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Act of Settlement passed by the Whigs, the crown was\r\nsettled on the descendants of the \"Princess Sophia\" of Hanover, a\r\nyounger daughter of a daughter of James I. There were before her James\r\nII., his son, the descendants of a daughter of Charles I., and elder\r\nchildren of her own mother. But the Whigs passed these over because\r\nthey were Catholics, and selected the Princess Sophia, who, if she was\r\nanything, was a Protestant. Certainly this selection was statesmanlike,\r\nbut it could not be very popular. It was quite impossible to say that\r\nit was the duty of the English people to obey the House of Hanover upon\r\nany principles which do not concede the right of the people to choose\r\ntheir rulers, and which do not degrade monarchy from its solitary\r\npinnacle of majestic reverence, and make it one only among many\r\nexpedient institutions. If a king is a useful public functionary who\r\nmay be changed, and in whose place you may make another, you cannot\r\nregard him with mystic awe and wonder; and if you are bound to worship\r\nhim, of course you cannot change him. Accordingly, during the whole\r\nreigns of George I. and George II. the sentiment of religious loyalty\r\naltogether ceased to support the Crown. The prerogative of the king had\r\nno strong party to support it; the Tories, who naturally would support\r\nit, disliked the actual king; and the Whigs, according to their creed,\r\ndisliked the king's office. Until the accession of George III. the most\r\nvigorous opponents of the Crown were the country gentlemen, its natural\r\nfriends, and the representatives of quiet rural districts, where\r\nloyalty is mostly to be found, if anywhere. But after the accession of\r\nGeorge III. the common feeling came back to the same point as in Queen\r\nAnne's time. The English were ready to take the new young prince as the\r\nbeginning of a sacred line of sovereigns, just as they had been willing\r\nto take an old lady, who was the second cousin of his\r\ngreat-great-grandmother. So it is now. If you ask the immense majority\r\nof the Queen's subjects by what right she rules, they would never tell\r\nyou that she rules by Parliamentary right, by virtue of 6 Anne, c. 7.\r\nThey will say she rules by \"God's grace\"; they believe that they have a\r\nmystic obligation to obey her. When her family came to the Crown it was\r\na sort of treason to maintain the inalienable right of lineal\r\nsovereignty, for it was equivalent to saying that the claim of another\r\nfamily was better than hers: but now, in the strange course of human\r\nevents, that very sentiment has become her surest and best support.\r\n\r\nBut it would be a great mistake to believe that at the accession of\r\nGeorge III. the instinctive sentiment of hereditary loyalty at once\r\nbecame as useful as now. It began to be powerful, but it hardly began\r\nto be useful. There was so much harm done by it as well as so much\r\ngood, that it is quite capable of being argued whether on the whole it\r\nwas beneficial or hurtful. Throughout the greater part of his life\r\nGeorge III. was a kind of \"consecrated obstruction\". Whatever he did\r\nhad a sanctity different from what any one else did, and it perversely\r\nhappened that he was commonly wrong. He had as good intentions as any\r\none need have, and he attended to the business of his country, as a\r\nclerk with his bread to get attends to the business of his office. But\r\nhis mind was small, his education limited, and he lived in a changing\r\ntime. Accordingly, he was always resisting what ought to be, and\r\nprolonging what ought not to be. He was the sinister but sacred\r\nassailant of half his ministries; and when the French Revolution\r\nexcited the horror of the world, and proved democracy to be \"impious,\"\r\nthe piety of England concentrated upon him, and gave him tenfold\r\nstrength. The Monarchy by its religious sanction now confirms all our\r\npolitical order; in George III.'s time it confirmed little except\r\nitself. It gives now a vast strength to the entire Constitution, by\r\nenlisting on its behalf the credulous obedience of enormous masses;\r\nthen it lived aloof, absorbed all the holiness into itself, and turned\r\nover all the rest of the polity to the coarse justification of bare\r\nexpediency.\r\n\r\nA principal reason why the Monarchy so well consecrates our whole state\r\nis to be sought in the peculiarity many Americans and many utilitarians\r\nsmile at. They laugh at this \"extra,\" as the Yankee called it, at the\r\nsolitary transcendent element. They quote Napoleon's saying, \"that he\r\ndid not wish to be fatted in idleness,\" when he refused to be grand\r\nelector in Sieyes' Constitution, which was an office copied, and M.\r\nThiers says, well copied, from constitutional monarchy. But such\r\nobjections are wholly wrong. No doubt it was absurd enough in the Abbe\r\nSieyes to propose that a new institution, inheriting no reverence, and\r\nmade holy by no religion, should be created to fill the sort of post\r\noccupied by a constitutional king in nations of monarchical history.\r\nSuch an institution, far from being so august as to spread reverence\r\naround it, is too novel and artificial to get reverence for itself; if,\r\ntoo, the absurdity could anyhow be augmented, it was so by offering an\r\noffice of inactive uselessness and pretended sanctity to Napoleon, the\r\nmost active man in France, with the greatest genius for business, only\r\nnot sacred, and exclusively fit for action. But the blunder of Sieyes\r\nbrings the excellence of real monarchy to the best light. When a\r\nmonarch can bless, it is best that he should not be touched. It should\r\nbe evident that he does no wrong. He should not be brought too closely\r\nto real measurement. He should be aloof and solitary. As the functions\r\nof English royalty are for the most part latent, it fulfils this\r\ncondition. It seems to order, but it never seems to struggle. It is\r\ncommonly hidden like a mystery, and sometimes paraded like a pageant,\r\nbut in neither case is it contentious. The nation is divided into\r\nparties, but the crown is of no party. Its apparent separation from\r\nbusiness is that which removes it both from enmities and from\r\ndesecration, which preserves its mystery, which enables it to combine\r\nthe affection of conflicting parties--to be a visible symbol of unity\r\nto those still so imperfectly educated as to need a symbol.\r\n\r\nThirdly. The Queen is the head of our society. If she did not exist the\r\nPrime Minister would be the first person in the country. He and his\r\nwife would have to receive foreign ministers, and occasionally foreign\r\nprinces, to give the first parties in the country; he and she would be\r\nat the head of the pageant of life; they would represent England in the\r\neyes of foreign nations; they would represent the Government of England\r\nin the eyes of the English.\r\n\r\nIt is very easy to imagine a world in which this change would not be a\r\ngreat evil. In a country where people did not care for the outward show\r\nof life, where the genius of the people was untheatrical, and they\r\nexclusively regarded the substance of things, this matter would be\r\ntrifling. Whether Lord and Lady Derby received the foreign ministers,\r\nor Lord and Lady Palmerston, would be a matter of indifference; whether\r\nthey gave the nicest parties would be important only to the persons at\r\nthose parties. A nation of unimpressible philosophers would not care at\r\nall how the externals of life were managed. Who is the showman is not\r\nmaterial unless you care about the show.\r\n\r\nBut of all nations in the world the English are perhaps the least a\r\nnation of pure philosophers. It would be a very serious matter to us to\r\nchange every four or five years the visible head of our world. We are\r\nnot now remarkable for the highest sort of ambition; but we are\r\nremarkable for having a great deal of the lower sort of ambition and\r\nenvy. The House of Commons is thronged with people who get there merely\r\nfor \"social purposes,\" as the phrase goes; that is, that they and their\r\nfamilies may go to parties else impossible. Members of Parliament are\r\nenvied by thousands merely for this frivolous glory, as a thinker calls\r\nit. If the highest post in conspicuous life were thrown open to public\r\ncompetition, this low sort of ambition and envy would be fearfully\r\nincreased. Politics would offer a prize too dazzling for mankind;\r\nclever base people would strive for it, and stupid base people would\r\nenvy it. Even now a dangerous distinction is given by what is\r\nexclusively called public life. The newspapers describe daily and\r\nincessantly a certain conspicuous existence; they comment on its\r\ncharacters, recount its details, investigate its motives, anticipate\r\nits course. They give a precedent and a dignity to that world which\r\nthey do not give to any other. The literary world, the scientific\r\nworld, the philosophic world, not only are not comparable in dignity to\r\nthe political world, but in comparison are hardly worlds at all. The\r\nnewspaper makes no mention of them, and could not mention them. As are\r\nthe papers, so are the readers; they, by irresistible sequence and\r\nassociation, believe that those people who constantly figure in the\r\npapers are cleverer, abler, or at any rate, somehow higher, than other\r\npeople. \"I wrote books,\" we heard of a man saying, \"for twenty years,\r\nand I was nobody; I got into Parliament, and before I had taken my seat\r\nI had become somebody.\" English politicians are the men who fill the\r\nthoughts of the English public: they are the actors on the scene, and\r\nit is hard for the admiring spectators not to believe that the admired\r\nactor is greater than themselves. In this present age and country it\r\nwould be very dangerous to give the slightest addition to a force\r\nalready perilously great. If the highest social rank was to be\r\nscrambled for in the House of Commons, the number of social adventurers\r\nthere would be incalculably more numerous, and indefinitely more eager.\r\n\r\nA very peculiar combination of causes has made this characteristic one\r\nof the most prominent in English society. The middle ages left all\r\nEurope with a social system headed by Courts. The Government was made\r\nthe head of all society, all intercourse, and all life; everything paid\r\nallegiance to the sovereign, and everything ranged itself round the\r\nsovereign--what was next to be greatest, and what was farthest least.\r\nThe idea that the head of the Government is the head of society is so\r\nfixed in the ideas of mankind that only a few philosophers regard it as\r\nhistorical and accidental, though when the matter is examined, that\r\nconclusion is certain and even obvious.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, society as society does not naturally need a head\r\nat all. Its constitution, if left to itself, is not monarchical, but\r\naristocratical. Society, in the sense we are now talking of, is the\r\nunion of people for amusement and conversation. The making of marriages\r\ngoes on in it, as it were, incidentally, but its common and main\r\nconcern is talking and pleasure. There is nothing in this which needs a\r\nsingle supreme head; it is a pursuit in which a single person does not\r\nof necessity dominate. By nature it creates an \"upper ten thousand\"; a\r\ncertain number of persons and families possessed of equal culture, and\r\nequal faculties, and equal spirit, get to be on a level--and that level\r\na high level. By boldness, by cultivation, by \"social science\" they\r\nraise themselves above others; they become the \"first families,\" and\r\nall the rest come to be below them. But they tend to be much about a\r\nlevel among one another; no one is recognised by all or by many others\r\nas superior to them all. This is society as it grew up in Greece or\r\nItaly, as it grows up now in any American or colonial town. So far from\r\nthe notion of a \"head of society\" being a necessary notion, in many\r\nages it would scarcely have been an intelligible notion. You could not\r\nhave made Socrates understand it. He would have said, \"If you tell me\r\nthat one of my fellows is chief magistrate, and that I am bound to obey\r\nhim, I understand you, and you speak well; or that another is a priest,\r\nand that he ought to offer sacrifices to the gods which I or any one\r\nnot a priest ought not to offer, again I understand and agree with you.\r\nBut if you tell me that there is in some citizen a hidden charm by\r\nwhich his words become better than my words, and his house better than\r\nmy house, I do not follow you, and should be pleased if you will\r\nexplain yourself.\"\r\n\r\nAnd even if a head of society were a natural idea, it certainly would\r\nnot follow that the head of the civil Government should be that head.\r\nSociety as such has no more to do with civil polity than with\r\necclesiastical. The organisation of men and women for the purpose of\r\namusement is not necessarily identical with their organisation for\r\npolitical purposes, any more than with their organisation for religious\r\npurposes; it has of itself no more to do with the State than it has\r\nwith the Church. The faculties which fit a man to be a great ruler are\r\nnot those of society; some great rulers have been unintelligible like\r\nCromwell, or brusque like Napoleon, or coarse and barbarous like Sir\r\nRobert Walpole. The light nothings of the drawing-room and the grave\r\nthings of office are as different from one another as two human\r\noccupations can be. There is no naturalness in uniting the two; the end\r\nof it always is, that you put a man at the head of society who very\r\nlikely is remarkable for social defects, and is not eminent for social\r\nmerits.\r\n\r\nThe best possible commentary on these remarks is the history of English\r\nhistory. It has not been sufficiently remarked that a change has taken\r\nplace in the structure of our society exactly analogous to the change\r\nin our polity. A Republic has insinuated itself beneath the folds of a\r\nMonarchy. Charles II. was really the head of society; Whitehall, in his\r\ntime, was the centre of the best talk, the best fashion, and the most\r\ncurious love affairs of the age. He did not contribute good morality to\r\nsociety, but he set an example of infinite agreeableness. He\r\nconcentrated around him all the light part of the high world of London,\r\nand London concentrated around it all the light part of the high world\r\nof England. The Court was the focus where everything fascinating\r\ngathered, and where everything exciting centred. Whitehall was an\r\nunequalled club, with female society of a very clever and sharp sort\r\nsuperadded. All this, as we know, is now altered. Buckingham Palace is\r\nas unlike a club as any place is likely to be. The Court is a separate\r\npart, which stands aloof from the rest of the London world, and which\r\nhas but slender relations with the more amusing part of it. The first\r\ntwo Georges were men ignorant of English, and wholly unfit to guide and\r\nlead English society. They both preferred one or two German ladies of\r\nbad character to all else in London. George III. had no social vices,\r\nbut he had no social pleasures. He was a family man, and a man of\r\nbusiness, and sincerely preferred a leg of mutton and turnips after a\r\ngood day's work, to the best fashion and the most exciting talk. In\r\nconsequence, society in London, though still in form under the\r\ndomination of a Court, assumed in fact its natural and oligarchical\r\nstructure. It, too, has become an \"upper ten thousand\"; it is no more\r\nmonarchical in fact than the society of New York. Great ladies give the\r\ntone to it with little reference to the particular Court world. The\r\npeculiarly masculine world of the clubs and their neighbourhood has no\r\nmore to do in daily life with Buckingham Palace than with the\r\nTuileries. Formal ceremonies of presentation and attendance are\r\nretained. The names of levee and drawing-room still sustain the memory\r\nof the time when the king's bed-chamber and the queen's \"withdrawing\r\nroom\" were the centres of London life, but they no longer make a part\r\nof social enjoyment: they are a sort of ritual in which nowadays almost\r\nevery decent person can if he likes take part. Even Court balls, where\r\npleasure is at least supposed to be possible, are lost in a London\r\nJuly. Careful observers have long perceived this, but it was made\r\npalpable to every one by the death of the Prince Consort. Since then\r\nthe Court has been always in a state of suspended animation, and for a\r\ntime it was quite annihilated. But everything went on as usual. A few\r\npeople who had no daughters and little money made it an excuse to give\r\nfewer parties, and if very poor, stayed in the country, but upon the\r\nwhole the difference was not perceptible. The queen bee was taken away,\r\nbut the hive went on.\r\n\r\nRefined and original observers have of late objected to English royalty\r\nthat it is not splendid enough. They have compared it with the French\r\nCourt, which is better in show, which comes to the surface everywhere\r\nso that you cannot help seeing it, which is infinitely and beyond\r\nquestion the most splendid thing in France. They have said, \"that in\r\nold times the English Court took too much of the nation's money, and\r\nspent it ill; but now, when it could be trusted to spend well, it does\r\nnot take enough of the nation's money. There are arguments for not\r\nhaving a Court, and there are arguments for having a splendid Court;\r\nbut there are no arguments for having a mean Court. It is better to\r\nspend a million in dazzling when you wish to dazzle, than\r\nthree-quarters of a million in trying to dazzle and yet not dazzling.\"\r\nThere may be something in this theory; it may be that the Court of\r\nEngland is not quite as gorgeous as we might wish to see it. But no\r\ncomparison must ever be made between it and the French Court. The\r\nEmperor represents a different idea from the Queen. He is not the head\r\nof the State; he IS the State. The theory of his Government is that\r\nevery one in France is equal, and that the Emperor embodies the\r\nprinciple of equality. The greater you make him, the less, and\r\ntherefore the more equal, you make all others. He is magnified that\r\nothers may be dwarfed. The very contrary is the principle of English\r\nroyalty. As in politics it would lose its principal use if it came\r\nforward into the public arena, so in society if it advertised itself it\r\nwould be pernicious. We have voluntary show enough already in London;\r\nwe do not wish to have it encouraged and intensified, but quieted and\r\nmitigated. Our Court is but the head of an unequal, competing,\r\naristocratic society; its splendour would not keep others down, but\r\nincite others to come on. It is of use so long as it keeps others out\r\nof the first place, and is guarded and retired in that place. But it\r\nwould do evil if it added a new example to our many examples of showy\r\nwealth--if it gave the sanction of its dignity to the race of\r\nexpenditure.\r\n\r\nFourthly. We have come to regard the Crown as the head of our morality.\r\nThe virtues of Queen Victoria and the virtues of George III. have sunk\r\ndeep into the popular heart. We have come to believe that it is natural\r\nto have a virtuous sovereign, and that the domestic virtues are as\r\nlikely to be found on thrones as they are eminent when there. But a\r\nlittle experience and less thought show that royalty cannot take credit\r\nfor domestic excellence. Neither George I., nor George II., nor William\r\nIV. were patterns of family merit; George IV. was a model of family\r\ndemerit. The plain fact is, that to the disposition of all others most\r\nlikely to go wrong, to an excitable disposition, the place of a\r\nconstitutional king has greater temptations than almost any other, and\r\nfewer suitable occupations than almost any other. All the world and all\r\nthe glory of it, whatever is most attractive, whatever is most\r\nseductive, has always been offered to the Prince of Wales of the day,\r\nand always will be. It is not rational to expect the best virtue where\r\ntemptation is applied in the most trying form at the frailest time of\r\nhuman life. The occupations of a constitutional monarch are grave,\r\nformal, important, but never exciting; they have nothing to stir eager\r\nblood, awaken high imagination, work off wild thoughts. On men like\r\nGeorge III., with a predominant taste for business occupations, the\r\nroutine duties of constitutional royalty have doubtless a calm and\r\nchastening effect. The insanity with which he struggled, and in many\r\ncases struggled very successfully, during many years, would probably\r\nhave burst out much oftener but for the sedative effect of sedulous\r\nemployment. But how few princes have ever felt the anomalous impulse\r\nfor real work; how uncommon is that impulse anywhere; how little are\r\nthe circumstances of princes calculated to foster it; how little can it\r\nbe relied on as an ordinary breakwater to their habitual temptations!\r\nGrave and careful men may have domestic virtues on a constitutional\r\nthrone, but even these fail sometimes, and to imagine that men of more\r\neager temperaments will commonly produce them, is to expect grapes from\r\nthorns and figs from thistles.\r\n\r\nLastly, constitutional royalty has the function which I insisted on at\r\nlength in my last essay, and which, though it is by far the greatest, I\r\nneed not now enlarge upon again. It acts as a DISGUISE. It enables our\r\nreal rulers to change without heedless people knowing it. The masses of\r\nEnglishmen are not fit for an elective government; if they knew how\r\nnear they were to it, they would be surprised, and almost tremble.\r\n\r\nOf a like nature is the value of constitutional royalty in times of\r\ntransition. The greatest of all helps to the substitution of a Cabinet\r\ngovernment for a preceding absolute monarchy is the accession of a king\r\nfavourable to such a government, and pledged to it. Cabinet government,\r\nwhen new, is weak in time of trouble. The Prime Minister--the chief on\r\nwhom everything depends, who must take responsibility if any one is to\r\ntake it, who must use force if any one is to use it--is not fixed in\r\npower. He holds his place, by the essence of the Government, with some\r\nuncertainty. Among a people well-accustomed to such a Government, such\r\na functionary may be bold: he may rely, if not on the Parliament, on\r\nthe nation which understands and values him. But when that Government\r\nhas only recently been introduced, it is difficult for such a Minister\r\nto be as bold as he ought to be. His power rests too much on human\r\nreason, and too little on human instinct. The traditional strength of\r\nthe hereditary monarch is at these times of incalculable use. It would\r\nhave been impossible for England to get through the first years after\r\n1688 but for the singular ability of William III. It would have been\r\nimpossible for Italy to have attained and kept her freedom without the\r\nhelp of Victor Emmanuel: neither the work of Cavour nor the work of\r\nGaribaldi were more necessary than his. But the failure of Louis\r\nPhilippe to use his reserve power as constitutional monarch is the most\r\ninstructive proof how great that reserve power is. In February, 1848,\r\nGuizot was weak because his tenure of office was insecure. Louis\r\nPhilippe should have made that tenure certain. Parliamentary reform\r\nmight afterwards have been conceded to instructed opinion, but nothing\r\nought to have been conceded to the mob. The Parisian populace ought to\r\nhave been put down, as Guizot wished. If Louis Philippe had been a fit\r\nking to introduce free government, he would have strengthened his\r\nMinisters when they were the instruments of order, even if he\r\nafterwards discarded them when order was safe, and policy could be\r\ndiscussed. But he was one of the cautious men who are \"noted\" to fail\r\nin old age: though of the largest experience and of great ability, he\r\nfailed and lost his crown for want of petty and momentary energy, which\r\nat such a crisis a plain man would have at once put forth.\r\n\r\nSuch are the principal modes in which the institution of royalty by its\r\naugust aspect influences mankind, and in the English state of\r\ncivilisation they are invaluable. Of the actual business of the\r\nsovereign--the real work the Queen does--I shall speak in my next paper.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons has inquired into most things, but has never had a\r\ncommittee on \"the Queen\". There is no authentic blue-book to say what\r\nshe does. Such an investigation cannot take place; but if it could, it\r\nwould probably save her much vexatious routine, and many toilsome and\r\nunnecessary hours.\r\n\r\nThe popular theory of the English Constitution involves two errors as\r\nto the sovereign. First, in its oldest form at least, it considers him\r\nas an \"Estate of the Realm,\" a separate co-ordinate authority with the\r\nHouse of Lords and the House of Commons. This and much else the\r\nsovereign once was, but this he is no longer. That authority could only\r\nbe exercised by a monarch with a legislative veto. He should be able to\r\nreject bills, if not as the House of Commons rejects them, at least as\r\nthe House of Peers rejects them. But the Queen has no such veto. She\r\nmust sign her own death-warrant if the two Houses unanimously send it\r\nup to her. It is a fiction of the past to ascribe to her legislative\r\npower. She has long ceased to have any. Secondly, the ancient theory\r\nholds that the Queen is the executive. The American Constitution was\r\nmade upon a most careful argument, and most of that argument assumes\r\nthe king to be the administrator of the English Constitution, and an\r\nunhereditary substitute for him--viz., a president--to be peremptorily\r\nnecessary. Living across the Atlantic, and misled by accepted\r\ndoctrines, the acute framers of the Federal Constitution, even after\r\nthe keenest attention, did not perceive the Prime Minister to be the\r\nprincipal executive of the British Constitution, and the sovereign a\r\ncog in the mechanism. There is, indeed, much excuse for the American\r\nlegislators in the history of that time. They took their idea of our\r\nConstitution from the time when they encountered it. But in the\r\nso-called Government of Lord North, George III. was the Government.\r\nLord North was not only his appointee, but his agent. The Minister\r\ncarried on a war which he disapproved and hated, because it was a war\r\nwhich his sovereign approved and liked. Inevitably, therefore, the\r\nAmerican Convention believed the King, from whom they had suffered, to\r\nbe the real executive, and not the Minister, from whom they had not\r\nsuffered.\r\n\r\nIf we leave literary theory, and look to our actual old law, it is\r\nwonderful how much the sovereign can do. A few years ago the Queen very\r\nwisely attempted to make life peers, and the House of Lords very\r\nunwisely, and contrary to its own best interests, refused to admit her\r\nclaim. They said her power had decayed into non-existence; she once had\r\nit, they allowed, but it had ceased by long disuse. If any one will run\r\nover the pages of Comyn's Digest or any other such book, title\r\n\"Prerogative,\" he will find the Queen has a hundred such powers which\r\nwaver between reality and desuetude, and which would cause a protracted\r\nand very interesting legal argument if she tried to exercise them. Some\r\ngood lawyer ought to write a careful book to say which of these powers\r\nare really usable, and which are obsolete. There is no authentic\r\nexplicit information as to what the Queen can do, any more than of what\r\nshe does.\r\n\r\nIn the bare superficial theory of free institutions this is undoubtedly\r\na defect. Every power in a popular Government ought to be known. The\r\nwhole notion of such a Government is that the political people--the\r\ngoverning people--rules as it thinks fit. All the acts of every\r\nadministration are to be canvassed by it; it is to watch if such acts\r\nseem good, and in some manner or other to interpose if they seem not\r\ngood. But it cannot judge if it is to be kept in ignorance; it cannot\r\ninterpose if it does not know. A secret prerogative is an\r\nanomaly--perhaps the greatest of anomalies. That secrecy is, however,\r\nessential to the utility of English royalty as it now is. Above all\r\nthings our royalty is to be reverenced, and if you begin to poke about\r\nit you cannot reverence it. When there is a select committee on the\r\nQueen, the charm of royalty will be gone. Its mystery is its life. We\r\nmust not let in daylight upon magic. We must not bring the Queen into\r\nthe combat of politics, or she will cease to be reverenced by all\r\ncombatants; she will become one combatant among many. The existence of\r\nthis secret power is, according to abstract theory, a defect in our\r\nconstitutional polity, but it is a defect incident to a civilisation\r\nsuch as ours, where august and therefore unknown powers are needed, as\r\nwell as known and serviceable powers.\r\n\r\nIf we attempt to estimate the working of this inner power by the\r\nevidence of those, whether dead or living, who have been brought in\r\ncontact with it, we shall find a singular difference. Both the\r\ncourtiers of George III. and the courtiers of Queen Victoria are agreed\r\nas to the magnitude of the royal influence. It is with both an accepted\r\nsecret doctrine that the Crown does more than it seems. But there is a\r\nwide discrepancy in opinion as to the quality of that action. Mr. Fox\r\ndid not scruple to describe the hidden influence of George III. as the\r\nundetected agency of \"an infernal spirit\". The action of the Crown at\r\nthat period was the dread and terror of Liberal politicians. But now\r\nthe best Liberal politicians say, \"WE shall never know, but when\r\nhistory is written our children may know, what we owe to the Queen and\r\nPrince Albert\". The mystery of the Constitution, which used to be hated\r\nby our calmest, most thoughtful, and instructed statesmen, is now loved\r\nand reverenced by them.\r\n\r\nBefore we try to account for this change, there is one part of the\r\nduties of the Queen which should be struck out of the discussion. I\r\nmean the formal part. The Queen has to assent to and sign countless\r\nformal documents, which contain no matter of policy, of which the\r\npurport is insignificant, which any clerk could sign as well. One great\r\nclass of documents George III. used to read before he signed them, till\r\nLord Thurlow told him, \"It was nonsense his looking at them, for he\r\ncould not understand them\". But the worst case is that of commissions\r\nin the army. Till an Act passed only three years since the Queen used\r\nto sign ALL military commissions, and she still signs all fresh\r\ncommissions. The inevitable and natural consequence is that such\r\ncommissions were, and to some extent still are, in arrears by\r\nthousands. Men have often been known to receive their commissions for\r\nthe first time years after they have left the service. If the Queen had\r\nbeen an ordinary officer she would long since have complained, and long\r\nsince have been relieved of this slavish labour. A cynical statesman is\r\nsaid to have defended it on the ground \"that you MAY have a fool for a\r\nsovereign, and then it would be desirable he should have plenty of\r\noccupation in which he can do no harm\". But it is in truth childish to\r\nheap formal duties of business upon a person who has of necessity so\r\nmany formal duties of society. It is a remnant of the old days when\r\nGeorge III. would know everything, however trivial, and assent to\r\neverything, however insignificant. These labours of routine may be\r\ndismissed from the discussions. It is not by them that the sovereign\r\nacquires his authority either for evil or for good.\r\n\r\nThe best mode of testing what we owe to the Queen is to make a vigorous\r\neffort of the imagination, and see how we should get on without her.\r\nLet us strip Cabinet government of all its accessories, let us reduce\r\nit to its two necessary constituents--a representative assembly (a\r\nHouse of Commons) and a Cabinet appointed by that assembly--and examine\r\nhow we should manage with them only. We are so little accustomed to\r\nanalyse the Constitution; we are so used to ascribe the whole effect of\r\nthe Constitution to the whole Constitution, that a great many people\r\nwill imagine it to be impossible that a nation should thrive or even\r\nlive with only these two simple elements. But it is upon that\r\npossibility that the general imitability of the English Government\r\ndepends. A monarch that can be truly reverenced, a House of Peers that\r\ncan be really respected, are historical accidents nearly peculiar to\r\nthis one island, and entirely peculiar to Europe. A new country, if it\r\nis to be capable of a Cabinet government, if it is not to degrade\r\nitself to Presidential government, must create that Cabinet out of its\r\nnative resources--must not rely on these Old World debris.\r\n\r\nMany modes might be suggested by which a Parliament might do in\r\nappearance what our Parliament does in reality, viz., appoint a\r\nPremier. But I prefer to select the simplest of all modes. We shall\r\nthen see the bare skeleton of this polity, perceive in what it differs\r\nfrom the royal form, and be quite free from the imputation of having\r\nselected an unduly charming and attractive substitute.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose the House of Commons--existing alone and by itself--to\r\nappoint the Premier quite simply, just as the shareholders of a railway\r\nchoose a director. At each vacancy, whether caused by death or\r\nresignation, let any member or members have the right of nominating a\r\nsuccessor; after a proper interval, such as the time now commonly\r\noccupied by a Ministerial crisis, ten days or a fortnight, let the\r\nmembers present vote for the candidate they prefer; then let the\r\nSpeaker count the votes, and the candidate with the greatest number be\r\nPremier. This mode of election would throw the whole choice into the\r\nhands of party organisation, just as our present mode does, except in\r\nso far as the Crown interferes with it; no outsider would ever be\r\nappointed, because the immense number of votes which every great party\r\nbrings into the field would far outnumber every casual and petty\r\nminority. The Premier should not be appointed for a fixed time, but\r\nduring good behaviour or the pleasure of Parliament. Mutatis mutandis,\r\nsubject to the differences now to be investigated, what goes on now\r\nwould go on then. The Premier then, as now, must resign upon a vote of\r\nwant of confidence, but the volition of Parliament would then be the\r\novert and single force in the selection of a successor, whereas it is\r\nnow the predominant though latent force.\r\n\r\nIt will help the discussion very much if we divide it into three parts.\r\nThe whole course of a representative Government has three\r\nstages--first, when a Ministry is appointed; next, during its\r\ncontinuance; last, when it ends. Let us consider what is the exact use\r\nof the Queen at each of these stages, and how our present form of\r\ngovernment differs in each, whether for good or for evil from that\r\nsimpler form of Cabinet government which might exist without her.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of an administration there would not be much\r\ndifference between the royal and unroyal species of Cabinet governments\r\nwhen there were only two great parties in the State, and when the\r\ngreater of those parties was thoroughly agreed within itself who should\r\nbe its Parliamentary leader, and who therefore should be its Premier.\r\nThe sovereign must now accept that recognised leader; and if the choice\r\nwere directly made by the House of Commons, the House must also choose\r\nhim; its supreme section, acting compactly and harmoniously, would sway\r\nits decisions without substantial resistance, and perhaps without even\r\napparent competition. A predominant party, rent by no intestine\r\ndemarcation, would be despotic. In such a case Cabinet government would\r\ngo on without friction whether there was a Queen or whether there was\r\nno Queen. The best sovereign could then achieve no good, and the worst\r\neffect no harm.\r\n\r\nBut the difficulties are far greater when the predominant party is not\r\nagreed who should be its leader. In the royal form of Cabinet\r\ngovernment the sovereign then has sometimes a substantial selection; in\r\nthe unroyal, who would choose? There must be a meeting at \"Willis's\r\nRooms\"; there must be that sort of interior despotism of the majority\r\nover the minority within the party, by which Lord John Russell in 1859\r\nwas made to resign his pretensions to the supreme government, and to be\r\ncontent to serve as a subordinate to Lord Palmerston. The tacit\r\ncompression which a party anxious for office would exercise over\r\nleaders who divided its strength, would be used and must be used.\r\nWhether such a party would always choose precisely the best man may\r\nwell be doubted. In a party once divided it is very difficult to secure\r\nunanimity in favour of the very person whom a disinterested bystander\r\nwould recommend. All manner of jealousies and enmities are immediately\r\nawakened, and it is always difficult, often impossible, to get them to\r\nsleep again. But though such a party might not select the very best\r\nleader, they have the strongest motives to select a very good leader.\r\nThe maintenance of their rule depends on it Under a Presidential\r\nConstitution the preliminary caucuses which choose the President need\r\nnot care as to the ultimate fitness of the man they choose. They are\r\nsolely concerned with his attractiveness as a candidate; they need not\r\nregard his efficiency as a ruler. If they elect a man of weak judgment,\r\nhe will reign his stated term; even though he show the best judgment,\r\nat the end of that term there will be by constitutional destiny another\r\nelection. But under a Ministerial government there is no such fixed\r\ndestiny. The Government is a removable Government, its tenure depends\r\nupon its conduct. If a party in power were so foolish as to choose a\r\nweak man for its head, it would cease to be in power. Its judgment is\r\nits life. Suppose in 1859 that the Whig party had determined to set\r\naside both Earl Russell and Lord Palmerston and to choose for its head\r\nan incapable nonentity, the Whig party would probably have been exiled\r\nfrom office at the Schleswig-Holstein difficulty. The nation would have\r\ndeserted them, and Parliament would have deserted them, too; neither\r\nwould have endured to see a secret negotiation, on which depended the\r\nportentous alternative of war or peace, in the hands of a person who\r\nwas thought to be weak--who had been promoted because of his\r\nmediocrity--whom his own friends did not respect. A Ministerial\r\ngovernment, too, is carried on in the face of day. Its life is in\r\ndebate. A President may be a weak man; yet if he keep good Ministers to\r\nthe end of his administration, he may not be found out--it may still be\r\na dubious controversy whether he is wise or foolish. But a Prime\r\nMinister must show what he is. He must meet the House of Commons in\r\ndebate; he must be able to guide that assembly in the management of its\r\nbusiness, to gain its ear in every emergency, to rule it in its hours\r\nof excitement. He is conspicuously submitted to a searching test, and\r\nif he fails he must resign.\r\n\r\nNor would any party like to trust to a weak man the great power which a\r\nCabinet government commits to its Premier. The Premier, though elected\r\nby Parliament can dissolve Parliament. Members would be naturally\r\nanxious that the power which might destroy their coveted dignity should\r\nbe lodged in fit hands. They dare not place in unfit hands a power\r\nwhich, besides hurting the nation, might altogether ruin them. We may\r\nbe sure, therefore, that whenever the predominant party is divided, the\r\nUN-royal form of Cabinet government would secure for us a fair and able\r\nParliamentary leader--that it would give us a good Premier, if not the\r\nvery best. Can it be said that the royal form does more?\r\n\r\nIn one case I think it may. If the constitutional monarch be a man of\r\nsingular discernment, of unprejudiced disposition, and great political\r\nknowledge, he may pick out from the ranks of the divided party its very\r\nbest leader, even at a time when the party, if left to itself, would\r\nnot nominate him. If the sovereign be able to play the part of that\r\nthoroughly intelligent but perfectly disinterested spectator who is so\r\nprominent in the works of certain moralists, he may be able to choose\r\nbetter for his subjects than they would choose for themselves. But if\r\nthe monarch be not so exempt from prejudice, and have not this nearly\r\nmiraculous discernment, it is not likely that he will be able to make a\r\nwiser choice than the choice of the party itself. He certainly is not\r\nunder the same motive to choose wisely. His place is fixed whatever\r\nhappens, but the failure of an appointing party depends on the capacity\r\nof their appointee.\r\n\r\nThere is great danger, too, that the judgment of the sovereign may be\r\nprejudiced. For more than forty years the personal antipathies of\r\nGeorge III. materially impaired successive administrations. Almost at\r\nthe beginning of his career he discarded Lord Chatham: almost at the\r\nend he would not permit Mr. Pitt to coalesce with Mr. Fox. He always\r\npreferred mediocrity; he generally disliked high ability; he always\r\ndisliked great ideas. If constitutional monarchs be ordinary men of\r\nrestricted experience and common capacity (and we have no right to\r\nsuppose that BY MIRACLE they will be more), the judgment of the\r\nsovereign will often be worse than the judgment of the party, and he\r\nwill be very subject to the chronic danger of preferring a respectful\r\ncommon-place man, such as Addington, to an independent first-rate man,\r\nsuch as Pitt.\r\n\r\nWe shall arrive at the same sort of mixed conclusion if we examine the\r\nchoice of a Premier under both systems in the critical case of Cabinet\r\ngovernment--the case of three parties. This is the case in which that\r\nspecies of government is most sure to exhibit its defects, and least\r\nlikely to exhibit its merits. The defining characteristic of that\r\ngovernment is the choice of the executive ruler by the legislative\r\nassembly; but when there are three parties a satisfactory choice is\r\nimpossible. A really good selection is a selection by a large majority\r\nwhich trusts those it chooses, but when there are three parties there\r\nis no such trust. The numerically weakest has the casting vote--it can\r\ndetermine which candidate shall be chosen. But it does so under a\r\npenalty. It forfeits the right of voting for its own candidate. It\r\nsettles which of other people's favourites shall be chosen, on\r\ncondition of abandoning its own favourite. A choice based on such\r\nself-denial can never be a firm choice--it is a choice at any moment\r\nliable to be revoked. The events of 1858, though not a perfect\r\nillustration of what I mean, are a sufficient illustration. The Radical\r\nparty, acting apart from the moderate Liberal party, kept Lord Derby in\r\npower. The ultra-movement party thought it expedient to combine with\r\nthe non-movement party. As one of them coarsely but clearly put it, \"WE\r\nget more of our way under these men than under the other men\"; he meant\r\nthat, in his judgment, the Tories would be more obedient to the\r\nRadicals than the Whigs. But it is obvious that a union of opposites so\r\nmarked could not be durable. The Radicals bought it by choosing the men\r\nwhose principles were most adverse to them; the Conservatives bought it\r\nby agreeing to measures whose scope was most adverse to them. After a\r\nshort interval the Radicals returned to their natural alliance and\r\ntheir natural discontent with the moderate Whigs. They used their\r\ndetermining vote first for a Government of one opinion and then for a\r\nGovernment of the contrary opinion.\r\n\r\nI am not blaming this policy. I am using it merely as an illustration.\r\nI say that if we imagine this sort of action greatly exaggerated and\r\ngreatly prolonged Parliamentary government becomes impossible. If there\r\nare three parties, no two of which will steadily combine for mutual\r\naction, but of which the weakest gives a rapidly oscillating preference\r\nto the two others, the primary condition of a Cabinet polity is not\r\nsatisfied. We have not a Parliament fit to choose; we cannot rely on\r\nthe selection of a sufficiently permanent executive, because there is\r\nno fixity in the thoughts and feelings of the choosers.\r\n\r\nUnder every species of Cabinet government, whether the royal or the\r\nunroyal, this defect can be cured in one way only. The moderate people\r\nof every party must combine to support the Government which, on the\r\nwhole, suits every party best. This is the mode in which Lord\r\nPalmerston's administration has been lately maintained; a Ministry in\r\nmany ways defective, but more beneficially vigorous abroad, and more\r\nbeneficially active at home, than the vast majority of English\r\nMinistries. The moderate Conservatives and the moderate Radicals have\r\nmaintained a steady Government by a sufficiently coherent union with\r\nthe moderate Whigs. Whether there is a king or no king, this\r\nperservative self-denial is the main force on which we must rely for\r\nthe satisfactory continuance of a Parliamentary Government at this its\r\nperiod of greatest trial. Will that moderation be aided or impaired by\r\nthe addition of a sovereign? Will it be more effectual under the royal\r\nsort of Ministerial Government, or will it be less effectual?\r\n\r\nIf the sovereign has a genius for discernment, the aid which he can\r\ngive at such a crisis will be great. He will select for his Minister,\r\nand if possible maintain as his Minister, the statesman upon whom the\r\nmoderate party will ultimately fix their choice, but for whom at the\r\noutset it is blindly searching; being a man of sense, experience, and\r\ntact, he will discern which is the combination of equilibrium, which is\r\nthe section with whom the milder members of the other sections will at\r\nlast ally themselves. Amid the shifting transitions of confused\r\nparties, it is probable that he will have many opportunities of\r\nexercising a selection. It will rest with him to call either on A B to\r\nform an administration, or upon X Y, and either may have a chance of\r\ntrial. A disturbed state of parties is inconsistent with fixity, but it\r\nabounds in momentary tolerance. Wanting something, but not knowing with\r\nprecision what, parties will accept for a brief period anything, to see\r\nwhether it may be that unknown something--to see what it will do.\r\nDuring the long succession of weak Governments which begins with the\r\nresignation of the Duke of Newcastle in 1762 and ends with the\r\naccession of Mr. Pitt in 1784, the vigorous will of George III. was an\r\nagency of the first magnitude. If at a period of complex and protracted\r\ndivision of parties, such as are sure to occur often and last long in\r\nevery enduring Parliamentary government, the extrinsic force of royal\r\nselection were always exercised discreetly, it would be a political\r\nbenefit of incalculable value.\r\n\r\nBut will it be so exercised? A constitutional sovereign must in the\r\ncommon course of government be a man of but common ability. I am\r\nafraid, looking to the early acquired feebleness of hereditary\r\ndynasties, that we must expect him to be a man of inferior ability.\r\nTheory and experience both teach that the education of a prince can be\r\nbut a poor education, and that a royal family will generally have less\r\nability than other families. What right have we then to expect the\r\nperpetual entail on any family of an exquisite discretion, which if it\r\nbe not a sort of genius, is at least as rare as genius?\r\n\r\nProbably in most cases the greatest wisdom of a constitutional king\r\nwould show itself in well-considered inaction. In the confused interval\r\nbetween 1857 and 1859 the Queen and Prince Albert were far too wise to\r\nobtrude any selection of their own. If they had chosen, perhaps they\r\nwould not have chosen Lord Palmerston. But they saw, or may be believed\r\nto have seen, that the world was settling down without them, and that\r\nby interposing an extrinsic agency, they would but delay the beneficial\r\ncrystallisation of intrinsic forces. There is, indeed, a permanent\r\nreason which would make the wisest king, and the king who feels most\r\nsure of his wisdom, very slow to use that wisdom. The responsibility of\r\nParliament should be felt by Parliament. So long as Parliament thinks\r\nit is the sovereign's business to find a Government it will be sure not\r\nto find a Government itself. The royal form of Ministerial government\r\nis the worst of all forms if it erect the subsidiary apparatus into the\r\nprincipal force, if it induce the assembly which ought to perform\r\nparamount duties to expect some one else to perform them.\r\n\r\nIt should be observed, too, in fairness to the unroyal species of\r\nCabinet government, that it is exempt from one of the greatest and most\r\ncharacteristic defects of the royal species. Where there is no Court\r\nthere can be no evil influence from a Court. What these influences are\r\nevery one knows; though no one, hardly the best and closest observer,\r\ncan say with confidence and precision how great their effect is. Sir\r\nRobert Walpole, in language too coarse for our modern manners, declared\r\nafter the death of Queen Caroline, that he would pay no attention to\r\nthe king's daughters (\"those girls,\" as he called them), but would rely\r\nexclusively on Madame de Walmoden, the king's mistress. \"The king,\"\r\nsays a writer in George IV.'s time, \"is in our favour, and what is more\r\nto the purpose, the Marchioness of Conyngham is so too.\" Everybody\r\nknows to what sort of influences several Italian changes of Government\r\nsince the unity of Italy have been attributed. These sinister agencies\r\nare likely to be most effective just when everything else is troubled,\r\nand when, therefore, they are particularly dangerous. The wildest and\r\nwickedest king's mistress would not plot against an invulnerable\r\nadministration. But very many will intrigue when Parliament is\r\nperplexed, when parties are divided, when alternatives are many, when\r\nmany evil things are possible, when Cabinet government must be\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\nIt is very important to see that a good administration can be started\r\nwithout a sovereign, because some colonial statesmen have doubted it.\r\n\"I can conceive,\" it has been said, \"that a Ministry would go on well\r\nenough without a governor when it was launched, but I do not see how to\r\nlaunch it.\" It has even been suggested that a colony which broke away\r\nfrom England, and had to form its own Government, might not unwisely\r\nchoose a governor for life, and solely trusted with selecting\r\nMinisters, something like the Abbe Sieyes's grand elector. But the\r\nintroduction of such an officer into such a colony would in fact be the\r\nvoluntary erection of an artificial encumbrance to it. He would\r\ninevitably be a party man. The most dignified post in the State must be\r\nan object of contest to the great sections into which every active\r\npolitical community is divided. These parties mix in everything and\r\nmeddle in everything; and they neither would nor could permit the most\r\nhonoured and conspicuous of all stations to be filled, except at their\r\npleasure. They know, too, that the grand elector, the great chooser of\r\nMinistries, might be, at a sharp crisis, either a good friend or a bad\r\nenemy. The strongest party would select some one who would be on their\r\nside when he had to take a side, who would incline to them when he did\r\nincline, who should be a constant auxiliary to them and a constant\r\nimpediment to their adversaries. It is absurd to choose by contested\r\nparty election an impartial chooser of Ministers.\r\n\r\nBut it is during the continuance of a Ministry, rather than at its\r\ncreation, that the functions of the sovereign will mainly interest most\r\npersons, and that most people will think them to be of the gravest\r\nimportance. I own I am myself of that opinion. I think it may be shown\r\nthat the post of sovereign over an intelligent and political people\r\nunder a constitutional monarchy is the post which a wise man would\r\nchoose above any other--where he would find the intellectual impulses\r\nbest stimulated and the worst intellectual impulses best controlled.\r\n\r\nOn the duties of the Queen during an administration we have an\r\ninvaluable fragment from her own hand. In 1851 Louis Napoleon had his\r\ncoup d'etat: in 1852 Lord John Russell had his--he expelled Lord\r\nPalmerston. By a most instructive breach of etiquette he read in the\r\nHouse a royal memorandum on the duties of his rival. It is as follows:\r\n\"The Queen requires, first, that Lord Palmerston will distinctly state\r\nwhat he proposes in a given case, in order that the Queen may know as\r\ndistinctly to what she is giving her royal sanction. Secondly, having\r\nonce given her sanction to such a measure that it be not arbitrarily\r\naltered or modified by the Minister. Such an act she must consider as\r\nfailing in sincerity towards the Crown, and justly to be visited by the\r\nexercise of her constitutional right of dismissing that Minister. She\r\nexpects to be kept informed of what passes between him and Foreign\r\nMinisters before important decisions are taken based upon that\r\nintercourse; to receive the foreign despatches in good time; and to\r\nhave the drafts for her approval sent to her in sufficient time to make\r\nherself acquainted with their contents before they must be sent off.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to the control over particular Ministers, and especially\r\nover the Foreign Minister, the Queen has a certain control over the\r\nCabinet. The first Minister, it is understood, transmits to her\r\nauthentic information of all the most important decisions, together\r\nwith, what the newspapers would do equally well, the more important\r\nvotes in Parliament. He is bound to take care that she knows everything\r\nwhich there is to know as to the passing politics of the nation. She\r\nhas by rigid usage a right to complain if she does not know of every\r\ngreat act of her Ministry, not only before it is done, but while there\r\nis yet time to consider it--while it is still possible that it may not\r\nbe done.\r\n\r\nTo state the matter shortly, the sovereign has, under a constitutional\r\nmonarchy such as ours, three rights--the right to be consulted, the\r\nright to encourage, the right to warn. And a king of great sense and\r\nsagacity would want no others. He would find that his having no others\r\nwould enable him to use these with singular effect. He would say to his\r\nMinister: \"The responsibility of these measures is upon you. Whatever\r\nyou think best must be done. Whatever you think best shall have my full\r\nand effectual support. BUT you will observe that for this reason and\r\nthat reason what you propose to do is bad; for this reason and that\r\nreason what you do not propose is better. I do not oppose, it is my\r\nduty not to oppose; but observe that I WARN.\" Supposing the king to be\r\nright, and to have what kings often have, the gift of effectual\r\nexpression, he could not help moving his Minister. He might not always\r\nturn his course, but he would always trouble his mind.\r\n\r\nIn the course of a long reign a sagacious king would acquire an\r\nexperience with which few Ministers could contend. The king could say:\r\n\"Have you referred to the transactions which happened during such and\r\nsuch an administration, I think about fourteen years ago? They afford\r\nan instructive example of the bad results which are sure to attend the\r\npolicy which you propose. You did not at that time take so prominent a\r\npart in public life as you now do, and it is possible you do not fully\r\nremember all the events. I should recommend you to recur to them, and\r\nto discuss them with your older colleagues who took part in them. It is\r\nunwise to recommence a policy which so lately worked so ill.\" The king\r\nwould indeed have the advantage which a permanent under-secretary has\r\nover his superior the Parliamentary secretary--that of having shared in\r\nthe proceedings of the previous Parliamentary secretaries. These\r\nproceedings were part of his own life; occupied the best of his\r\nthoughts, gave him perhaps anxiety, perhaps pleasure, were commenced in\r\nspite of his dissuasion, or were sanctioned by his approval. The\r\nParliamentary secretary vaguely remembers that something was done in\r\nthe time of some of his predecessors, when he very likely did not know\r\nthe least or care the least about that sort of public business. He has\r\nto begin by learning painfully and imperfectly what the permanent\r\nsecretary knows by clear and instant memory. No doubt a Parliamentary\r\nsecretary always can, and sometimes does, silence his subordinate by\r\nthe tacit might of his superior dignity. He says: \"I do not think there\r\nis much in all that. Many errors were committed at the time you refer\r\nto which we need not now discuss.\" A pompous man easily sweeps away the\r\nsuggestions of those beneath him. But though a minister may so deal\r\nwith his subordinate, he cannot so deal with his king. The social force\r\nof admitted superiority by which he overturned his under-secretary is\r\nnow not with him but against him. He has no longer to regard the\r\ndeferential hints of an acknowledged inferior, but to answer the\r\narguments of a superior to whom he has himself to be respectful. George\r\nIII. in fact knew the forms of public business as well or better than\r\nany statesman of his time. If, in addition to his capacity as a man of\r\nbusiness and to his industry, he had possessed the higher faculties of\r\na discerning states man, his influence would have been despotic. The\r\nold Constitution of England undoubtedly gave a sort of power to the\r\nCrown which our present Constitution does not give. While a majority in\r\nParliament was principally purchased by royal patronage, the king was a\r\nparty to the bargain either with his Minister or without his Minister.\r\nBut even under our present Constitution a monarch like George III.,\r\nwith high abilities, would possess the greatest influence. It is known\r\nto all Europe that in Belgium King Leopold has exercised immense power\r\nby the use of such means as I have described.\r\n\r\nIt is known, too, to every one conversant with the real course of the\r\nrecent history of England, that Prince Albert really did gain great\r\npower in precisely the same way. He had the rare gifts of a\r\nconstitutional monarch. If his life had been prolonged twenty years,\r\nhis name would have been known to Europe as that of King Leopold is\r\nknown. While he lived he was at a disadvantage. The statesmen who had\r\nmost power in England were men of far greater experience than himself.\r\nHe might, and no doubt did, exercise a great, if not a commanding\r\ninfluence over Lord Malmesbury, but he could not rule Lord Palmerston.\r\nThe old statesman who governed England, at an age when most men are\r\nunfit to govern their own families, remembered a whole generation of\r\nstates men who were dead before Prince Albert was born. The two were of\r\ndifferent ages and different natures. The elaborateness of the German\r\nprince--an elaborateness which has been justly and happily compared\r\nwith that of Goethe--was wholly alien to the half-Irish, half-English,\r\nstatesman. The somewhat boisterous courage in minor dangers, and the\r\nobtrusive use of an always effectual but not always refined,\r\ncommonplace, which are Lord Palmerston's defects, doubtless grated on\r\nPrince Albert, who had a scholar's caution and a scholar's courage. The\r\nfacts will be known to our children's children, though not to us.\r\nPrince Albert did much, but he died ere he could have made his\r\ninfluence felt on a generation of statesmen less experienced than he\r\nwas, and anxious to learn from him.\r\n\r\nIt would be childish to suppose that a conference between a Minister\r\nand his sovereign can ever be a conference of pure argument. \"The\r\ndivinity which doth hedge a king\" may have less sanctity than it had,\r\nbut it still has much sanctity. No one, or scarcely any one, can argue\r\nwith a Cabinet Minister in his own room as well as he would argue with\r\nanother man in another room. He cannot make his own points as well; he\r\ncannot unmake as well the points presented to him. A monarch's room is\r\nworse. The best instance is Lord Chatham, the most dictatorial and\r\nimperious of English statesmen, and almost the first English statesman\r\nwho was borne into power against the wishes of the king and against the\r\nwishes of the nobility--the first popular Minister. We might have\r\nexpected a proud tribune of the people to be dictatorial to his\r\nsovereign--to be to the king what he was to all others. On the\r\ncontrary, he was the slave of his own imagination; there was a kind of\r\nmystic enchantment in vicinity to the monarch which divested him of his\r\nordinary nature. \"The least peep into the king's closet,\" said Mr.\r\nBurke, \"intoxicates him, and will to the end of his life.\" A wit said\r\nthat, even at the levee, he bowed so low that you could see the tip of\r\nhis hooked nose between his legs. He was in the habit of kneeling at\r\nthe bedside of George III. while transacting business. Now no man can\r\nARGUE on his knees. The same superstitious feeling which keeps him in\r\nthat physical attitude will keep him in a corresponding mental\r\nattitude. He will not refute the bad arguments of the king as he will\r\nrefute another man's bad arguments. He will not state his own best\r\narguments effectively and incisively when he knows that the king would\r\nnot like to hear them. In a nearly balanced argument the king must\r\nalways have the better, and in politics many most important arguments\r\nare nearly balanced. Whenever there was much to be said for the king's\r\nopinion it would have its full weight; whatever was said for the\r\nMinister's opinion would only have a lessened and enfeebled weight.\r\n\r\nThe king, too, possesses a power, according to theory, for extreme use\r\non a critical occasion, but which he can in law use on any occasion. He\r\ncan dissolve; he can say to his Minister, in fact, if not in words,\r\n\"This Parliament sent you here, but I will see if I cannot get another\r\nParliament to send some one else here.\" George III. well understood\r\nthat it was best to take his stand at times and on points when it was\r\nperhaps likely, or at any rate not unlikely, the nation would support\r\nhim. He always made a Minister that he did not like tremble at the\r\nshadow of a possible successor. He had a cunning in such matters like\r\nthe cunning of insanity. He had conflicts with the ablest men of his\r\ntime, and he was hardly ever baffled. He understood how to help a\r\nfeeble argument by a tacit threat, and how best to address it to an\r\nhabitual deference.\r\n\r\nPerhaps such powers as these are what a wise man would most seek to\r\nexercise and least fear to possess. To wish to be a despot, \"to hunger\r\nafter tyranny,\" as the Greek phrase had it, marks in our day an\r\nuncultivated mind. A person who so wishes cannot have weighed what\r\nButler calls the \"doubtfulness things are involved in\". To be sure you\r\nare right to impose your will, or to wish to impose it, with violence\r\nupon others; to see your own ideas vividly and fixedly, and to be\r\ntormented till you can apply them in life and practice, not to like to\r\nhear the opinions of others, to be unable to sit down and weigh the\r\ntruth they have, are but crude states of intellect in our present\r\ncivilisation. We know, at least, that facts are many; that progress is\r\ncomplicated; that burning ideas (such as young men have) are mostly\r\nfalse and always incomplete. The notion of a far-seeing and despotic\r\nstatesman, who can lay down plans for ages yet unborn, is a fancy\r\ngenerated by the pride of the human intellect to which facts give no\r\nsupport. The plans of Charlemagne died with him; those of Richelieu\r\nwere mistaken; those of Napoleon gigantesque and frantic. But a wise\r\nand great constitutional monarch attempts no such vanities. His career\r\nis not in the air; he labours in the world of sober fact; he deals with\r\nschemes which can be effected--schemes which are desirable--schemes\r\nwhich are worth the cost. He says to the Ministry his people send to\r\nhim, to Ministry after Ministry, \"I think so and so; do you see if\r\nthere is anything in it. I have put down my reasons in a certain\r\nmemorandum, which I will give you. Probably it does not exhaust the\r\nsubject, but it will suggest materials for your consideration.\" By\r\nyears of discussion with Ministry after Ministry, the best plans of the\r\nwisest king would certainly be adopted, and the inferior plans, the\r\nimpracticable plans, rooted out and rejected. He could not be uselessly\r\nbeyond his time, for he would have been obliged to convince the\r\nrepresentatives, the characteristic men of his time. He would have the\r\nbest means of proving that he was right on all new and strange matters,\r\nfor he would have won to his side probably, after years of discussion,\r\nthe chosen agents of the commonplace world--men who were where they\r\nwere, because they had pleased the men of the existing age, who will\r\nnever be much disposed to new conceptions or profound thoughts. A\r\nsagacious and original constitutional monarch might go to his grave in\r\npeace if any man could. He would know that his best laws were in\r\nharmony with his age; that they suited the people who were to work\r\nthem, the people who were to be benefited by them. And he would have\r\npassed a happy life. He would have passed a life in which he could\r\nalways get his arguments heard, in which he could always make those who\r\nhave the responsibility of action think of them before they acted--in\r\nwhich he could know that the schemes which he had set at work in the\r\nworld were not the casual accidents of an individual idiosyncrasy,\r\nwhich are mostly much wrong, but the likeliest of all things to be\r\nright--the ideas of one very intelligent man at last accepted and acted\r\non by the ordinary intelligent many.\r\n\r\nBut can we expect such a king, or, for that is the material point, can\r\nwe expect a lineal series of such kings? Every one has heard the reply\r\nof the Emperor Alexander to Madame de Stael, who favoured him with a\r\ndeclamation in praise of beneficent despotism. \"Yes, Madame, but it is\r\nonly a happy accident.\" He well knew that the great abilities and the\r\ngood intentions necessary to make an efficient and good despot never\r\nwere continuously combined in any line of rulers. He knew that they\r\nwere far out of reach of hereditary human nature. Can it be said that\r\nthe characteristic qualities of a constitutional monarch are more\r\nwithin its reach? I am afraid it cannot. We found just now that the\r\ncharacteristic use of an hereditary constitutional monarch, at the\r\noutset of an administration, greatly surpassed the ordinary competence\r\nof hereditary faculties. I fear that an impartial investigation will\r\nestablish the same conclusion as to his uses during the continuance of\r\nan administration.\r\n\r\nIf we look at history, we shall find that it is only during the period\r\nof the present reign that in England the duties of a constitutional\r\nsovereign have ever been well performed. The first two Georges were\r\nignorant of English affairs, and wholly unable to guide them, whether\r\nwell or ill; for many years in their time the Prime Minister had, over\r\nand above the labour of managing Parliament, to manage the\r\nwoman--sometimes the queen, sometimes the mistress--who managed the\r\nsovereign; George III. interfered unceasingly, but he did harm\r\nunceasingly; George IV. and William IV. gave no steady continuing\r\nguidance, and were unfit to give it. On the Continent, in first-class\r\ncountries, constitutional royalty has never lasted out of one\r\ngeneration. Louis Philippe, Victor Emmanuel, and Leopold are the\r\nfounders of their dynasties; we must not reckon in constitutional\r\nmonarchy any more than in despotic monarchy on the permanence in the\r\ndescendants of the peculiar genius which founded the race. As far as\r\nexperience goes, there is no reason to expect an hereditary series of\r\nuseful limited monarchs.\r\n\r\nIf we look to theory, there is even less reason to expect it. A monarch\r\nis useful when he gives an effectual and beneficial guidance to his\r\nMinisters. But these Ministers are sure to be among the ablest men of\r\ntheir time. They will have had to conduct the business of Parliament so\r\nas to satisfy it; they will have to speak so as to satisfy it. The two\r\ntogether cannot be done save by a man of very great and varied ability.\r\nThe exercise of the two gifts is sure to teach a man much of the world;\r\nand if it did not, a Parliamentary leader has to pass through a\r\nmagnificent training before he becomes a leader. He has to gain a seat\r\nin Parliament; to gain the ear of Parliament; to gain the confidence of\r\nParliament; to gain the confidence of his colleagues. No one can\r\nachieve these--no one, still more, can both achieve them and retain\r\nthem--without a singular ability, nicely trained in the varied detail\r\nof life. What chance has an hereditary monarch such as nature forces\r\nhim to be, such as history shows he is, against men so educated and so\r\nborn? He can but be an average man to begin with; sometimes he will be\r\nclever, but sometimes he will be stupid; in the long run he will be\r\nneither clever nor stupid; he will be the simple, common man who plods\r\nthe plain routine of life from the cradle to the grave. His education\r\nwill be that of one who has never had to struggle; who has always felt\r\nthat he has nothing to gain; who has had the first dignity given him;\r\nwho has never seen common life as in truth it is. It is idle to expect\r\nan ordinary man born in the purple to have greater genius than an\r\nextraordinary man born out of the purple; to expect a man whose place\r\nhas always been fixed to have a better judgment than one who has lived\r\nby his judgment; to expect a man whose career will be the same whether\r\nhe is discreet or whether he is indiscreet to have the nice discretion\r\nof one who has risen by his wisdom, who will fall if he ceases to be\r\nwise.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic advantage of a constitutional king is the permanence\r\nof his place. This gives him the opportunity of acquiring a consecutive\r\nknowledge of complex transactions, but it gives only an opportunity.\r\nThe king must use it. There is no royal road to political affairs:\r\ntheir detail is vast, disagreeable, complicated, and miscellaneous. A\r\nking, to be the equal of his Ministers in discussion, must work as they\r\nwork; he must be a man of business as they are men of business. Yet a\r\nconstitutional prince is the man who is most tempted to pleasure, and\r\nthe least forced to business. A despot must feel that he is the pivot\r\nof the State. The stress of his kingdom is upon him. As he is, so are\r\nhis affairs. He may be seduced into pleasure; he may neglect all else;\r\nbut the risk is evident. He will hurt himself; he may cause a\r\nrevolution. If he becomes unfit to govern, some one else who is fit may\r\nconspire against him. But a constitutional king need fear nothing. He\r\nmay neglect his duties, but he will not be injured. His place will be\r\nas fixed, his income as permanent, his opportunities of selfish\r\nenjoyment as full as ever. Why should he work? It is true he will lose\r\nthe quiet and secret influence which in the course of years industry\r\nwould gain for him; but an eager young man, on whom the world is\r\nsquandering its luxuries and its temptations, will not be much\r\nattracted by the distant prospect of a moderate influence over dull\r\nmatters. He may form good intentions; he may say, \"Next year I WILL\r\nread these papers; I will try and ask more questions; I will not let\r\nthese women talk to me so\". But they will talk to him. The most\r\nhopeless idleness is that most smoothed with excellent plans. \"The Lord\r\nTreasurer,\" says Swift, \"promised he will settle it to-night, and so he\r\nwill say a hundred nights.\" We may depend upon it the ministry whose\r\npower will be lessened by the prince's attention will not be too eager\r\nto get him to attend.\r\n\r\nSo it is if the prince come young to the throne; but the case is worse\r\nwhen he comes to it old or middle-aged. He is then unfit to work. He\r\nwill then have spent the whole of youth and the first part of manhood\r\nin idleness, and it is unnatural to expect him to labour. A\r\npleasure-loving lounger in middle life will not begin to work as George\r\nIII. worked, or as Prince Albert worked. The only fit material for a\r\nconstitutional king is a prince who begins early to reign--who in his\r\nyouth is superior to pleasure--who in his youth is willing to\r\nlabour--who has by nature a genius for discretion. Such kings are among\r\nGod's greatest gifts, but they are also among His rarest.\r\n\r\nAn ordinary idle king on a constitutional throne will leave no mark on\r\nhis time: he will do little good and as little harm; the royal form of\r\nCabinet government will work in his time pretty much as the unroyal.\r\nThe addition of a cypher will not matter though it take precedence of\r\nthe significant figures. But corruptio optimi pessima. The most evil\r\ncase of the royal form is far worse than the most evil case of the\r\nunroyal. It is easy to imagine, upon a constitutional throne, an active\r\nand meddling fool who always acts when he should not, who never acts\r\nwhen he should, who warns his Ministers against their judicious\r\nmeasures, who encourages them in their injudicious measures. It is easy\r\nto imagine that such a king should be the tool of others; that\r\nfavourites should guide him; that mistresses should corrupt him; that\r\nthe atmosphere of a bad Court should be used to degrade free government.\r\n\r\nWe have had an awful instance of the dangers of constitutional royalty.\r\nWe have had the case of a meddling maniac. During great part of his\r\nlife George III.'s reason was half upset by every crisis. Throughout\r\nhis life he had an obstinacy akin to that of insanity. He was an\r\nobstinate and an evil influence; he could not be turned from what was\r\ninexpedient; by the aid of his station he turned truer but weaker men\r\nfrom what was expedient. He gave an excellent moral example to his\r\ncontemporaries, but he is an instance of those whose good dies with\r\nthem, while their evil lives after them. He prolonged the American War,\r\nperhaps he caused the American War, so we inherit the vestiges of an\r\nAmerican hatred; he forbade Mr. Pitt's wise plans, so we inherit an\r\nIrish difficulty. He would not let us do right in time, so now our\r\nattempts at right are out of time and fruitless. Constitutional royalty\r\nunder an active and half-insane king is one of the worst of\r\nGovernments. There is in it a secret power which is always eager, which\r\nis generally obstinate, which is often wrong, which rules Ministers\r\nmore than they know themselves, which overpowers them much more than\r\nthe public believe, which is irresponsible because it is inscrutable,\r\nwhich cannot be prevented because it cannot be seen. The benefits of a\r\ngood monarch are almost invaluable, but the evils of a bad monarch are\r\nalmost irreparable.\r\n\r\nWe shall find these conclusions confirmed if we examine the powers and\r\nduties of an English monarch at the break-up of an administration. But\r\nthe power of dissolution and the prerogative of creating peers, the\r\ncardinal powers of that moment are too important and involve too many\r\ncomplex matters to be sufficiently treated at the very end of a paper\r\nas long as this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNO. IV.\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSE OF LORDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my last essay I showed that it was possible for a constitutional\r\nmonarch to be, when occasion served, of first-rate use both at the\r\noutset and during the continuance of an administration; but that in\r\nmatter of fact it was not likely that he would be useful. The requisite\r\nideas, habits, and faculties, far surpass the usual competence of an\r\naverage man, educated in the common manner of sovereigns. The same\r\narguments are entirely applicable at the close of an administration.\r\nBut at that conjuncture the two most singular prerogatives of an\r\nEnglish king--the power of creating new peers and the power of\r\ndissolving the Commons--come into play; and we cannot duly criticise\r\nthe use or misuse of these powers till we know what the peers are and\r\nwhat the House of Commons is.\r\n\r\nThe use of the House of Lords or, rather, of the Lords, in its\r\ndignified capacity--is very great. It does not attract so much\r\nreverence as the Queen, but it attracts very much. The office of an\r\norder of nobility is to impose on the common people--not necessarily to\r\nimpose on them what is untrue, yet less what is hurtful; but still to\r\nimpose on their quiescent imaginations what would not otherwise be\r\nthere. The fancy of the mass of men is incredibly weak; it can see\r\nnothing without a visible symbol, and there is much that it can\r\nscarcely make out with a symbol. Nobility is the symbol of mind. It has\r\nthe marks from which the mass of men always used to infer mind, and\r\noften still infer it. A common clever man who goes into a country place\r\nwill get no reverence; but the \"old squire\" will get reverence. Even\r\nafter he is insolvent, when every one knows that his ruin is but a\r\nquestion of time, he will get five times as much respect from the\r\ncommon peasantry as the newly-made rich man who sits beside him. The\r\ncommon peasantry will listen to his nonsense more submissively than to\r\nthe new man's sense. An old lord will get infinite respect. His very\r\nexistence is so far useful that it awakens the sensation of obedience\r\nto a sort of mind in the coarse, dull, contracted multitude, who could\r\nneither appreciate nor perceive any other.\r\n\r\nThe order of nobility is of great use, too, not only in what it\r\ncreates, but in what it prevents. It prevents the rule of wealth--the\r\nreligion of gold. This is the obvious and natural idol of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon. He is always trying to make money; he reckons everything\r\nin coin; he bows down before a great heap and sneers as he passes a\r\nlittle heap. He has a \"natural instinctive admiration of wealth for its\r\nown sake\". And within good limits the feeling is quite right. So long\r\nas we play the game of industry vigorously and eagerly (and I hope we\r\nshall long play it, for we must be very different from what we are if\r\nwe do anything better), we shall of necessity respect and admire those\r\nwho play successfully, and a little despise those who play\r\nunsuccessfully. Whether this feeling be right or wrong, it is useless\r\nto discuss; to a certain degree, it is involuntary; it is not for\r\nmortals to settle whether we will have it or not; nature settles for us\r\nthat, within moderate limits, we must have it. But the admiration of\r\nwealth in many countries goes far beyond this; it ceases to regard in\r\nany degree the skill of acquisition; it respects wealth in the hands of\r\nthe inheritor just as much as in the hands of the maker; it is a simple\r\nenvy and love of a heap of gold as a heap of gold. From this our\r\naristocracy preserves us. There is no country where a \"poor devil of a\r\nmillionaire is so ill off as in England\". The experiment is tried every\r\nday, and every day it is proved that money alone--money pur et\r\nsimple--will not buy \"London Society\". Money is kept down, and, so to\r\nsay, cowed by the predominant authority of a different power.\r\n\r\nBut it may be said that this is no gain; that worship for worship, the\r\nworship of money is as good as the worship of rank. Even granting that\r\nit were so, it is a great gain to society to have two idols: in the\r\ncompetition of idolatries the true worship gets a chance. But it is not\r\ntrue that the reverence for rank--at least, for hereditary rank--is as\r\nbase as the reverence for money. As the world has gone, manner has been\r\nhalf-hereditary in certain castes, and manner is one of the fine arts.\r\nIt is the STYLE of society; it is in the daily-spoken intercourse of\r\nhuman beings what the art of literary expression is in their occasional\r\nwritten intercourse. In reverencing wealth we reverence not a man, but\r\nan appendix to a man; in reverencing inherited nobility, we reverence\r\nthe probable possession of a great faculty--the faculty of bringing out\r\nwhat is in one. The unconscious grace of life MAY be in the middle\r\nclasses: finely-mannered persons are born everywhere; but it OUGHT to\r\nbe in the aristocracy: and a man must be born with a hitch in his\r\nnerves if he has not some of it. It is a physiological possession of\r\nthe race, though it is sometimes wanting in the individual.\r\n\r\nThere is a third idolatry from which that of rank preserves us, and\r\nperhaps it is the worst of any--that of office. The basest deity is a\r\nsubordinate employee, and yet just now in civilised Governments it is\r\nthe commonest. In France and all the best of the Continent it rules\r\nlike a superstition. It is to no purpose that you prove that the pay of\r\npetty officials is smaller than mercantile pay; that their work is more\r\nmonotonous than mercantile work; that their mind is less useful and\r\ntheir life more tame. They are still thought to be greater and better.\r\nThey are decords; they have a little red on the left breast of their\r\ncoat, and no argument will answer that. In England, by the odd course\r\nof our society, what a theorist would desire has in fact turned up. The\r\ngreat offices, whether permanent or Parliamentary, which require mind\r\nnow give social prestige, and almost only those. An Under-Secretary of\r\nState with 2000 pounds a year is a much stronger man than the director\r\nof a finance company with 5000 pounds, and the country saves the\r\ndifference. But except in a few offices like the Treasury, which were\r\nonce filled with aristocratic people, and have an odour of nobility at\r\nsecond-hand, minor place is of no social use. A big grocer despises the\r\nexciseman; and what in many countries would be thought impossible, the\r\nexciseman envies the grocer. Solid wealth tells where there is no\r\nartificial dignity given to petty public functions. A clerk in the\r\npublic service is \"nobody\"; and you could not make a common Englishman\r\nsee why he should be anybody. But it must be owned that this turning of\r\nsociety into a political expedient has half spoiled it. A great part of\r\nthe \"best\" English people keep their mind in a state of decorous\r\ndulness. They maintain their dignity; they get obeyed; they are good\r\nand charitable to their dependants. But they have no notion of PLAY of\r\nmind: no conception that the charm of society depends upon it. They\r\nthink cleverness an antic, and have a constant though needless horror\r\nof being thought to have any of it. So much does this stiff dignity\r\ngive the tone, that the few Englishmen capable of social brilliancy\r\nmostly secrete it. They reserve it for persons whom they can trust, and\r\nwhom they know to be capable of appreciating its nuances. But a good\r\nGovernment is well worth a great deal of social dulness. The dignified\r\ntorpor of English society is inevitable if we give precedence, not to\r\nthe cleverest classes, but to the oldest classes, and we have seen how\r\nuseful that is.\r\n\r\nThe social prestige of the aristocracy is, as every one knows,\r\nimmensely less than it was a hundred years or even fifty years since.\r\nTwo great movements--the two greatest of modern society--have been\r\nunfavourable to it. The rise of industrial wealth in countless forms\r\nhas brought in a competitor which has generally more mind, and which\r\nwould be supreme were it not for awkwardness and intellectual gene.\r\nEvery day our companies, our railways, our debentures, and our shares,\r\ntend more and more to multiply these SURROUNDINGS of the aristocracy,\r\nand in time they will hide it. And while this undergrowth has come up,\r\nthe aristocracy have come down. They have less means of standing out\r\nthan they used to have. Their power is in their theatrical exhibition,\r\nin their state. But society is every day becoming less stately. As our\r\ngreat satirist has observed, \"The last Duke of St. David's used to\r\ncover the north road with his carriages; landladies and waiters bowed\r\nbefore him. The present Duke sneaks away from a railway station,\r\nsmoking a cigar, in a brougham.\" The aristocracy cannot lead the old\r\nlife if they would; they are ruled by a stronger power. They suffer\r\nfrom the tendency of all modern society to raise the average, and to\r\nlower--comparatively, and perhaps absolutely, to lower--the summit. As\r\nthe picturesqueness, the featureliness, of society diminishes,\r\naristocracy loses the single instrument of its peculiar power.\r\n\r\nIf we remember the great reverence which used to be paid to nobility as\r\nsuch, we shall be surprised that the House of Lords as an assembly, has\r\nalways been inferior; that it was always just as now, not the first,\r\nbut the second of our assemblies. I am not, of course, now speaking of\r\nthe middle ages: I am not dealing with the embryo or the infant form of\r\nour Constitution; I am only speaking of its adult form. Take the times\r\nof Sir R. Walpole. He was Prime Minister because he managed the House\r\nof Commons; he was turned out because he was beaten on an election\r\npetition in that House; he ruled England because he ruled that House.\r\nYet the nobility were then the governing power in England. In many\r\ndistricts the word of some lord was law. The \"wicked Lord Lowther,\" as\r\nhe was called, left a name of terror in Westmoreland during the memory\r\nof men now living. A great part of the borough members and a great part\r\nof the county members were their nominees; an obedient, unquestioning\r\ndeference was paid them. As individuals the peers were the greatest\r\npeople; as a House the collected peers were but the second House.\r\n\r\nSeveral causes contributed to create this anomaly, but the main cause\r\nwas a natural one. The House of Peers has never been a House where the\r\nmost important peers were most important. It could not be so. The\r\nqualities which fit a man for marked eminence, in a deliberative\r\nassembly, are not hereditary, and are not coupled with great estates.\r\nIn the nation, in the provinces, in his own province, a Duke of\r\nDevonshire, or a Duke of Bedford, was a much greater man than Lord\r\nThurlow. They had great estates, many boroughs, innumerable retainers,\r\nfollowings like a Court. Lord Thurlow had no boroughs, no retainers; he\r\nlived on his salary. Till the House of Lords met, the dukes were not\r\nonly the greatest, but immeasurably the greatest. But as soon as the\r\nHouse met, Lord Thurlow became the greatest. He could speak, and the\r\nothers could not speak. He could transact business in half an hour\r\nwhich they could not have transacted in a day, or could not have\r\ntransacted at all. When some foolish peer, who disliked his domination,\r\nsneered at his birth, he had words to meet the case: he said it was\r\nbetter for any one to owe his place to his own exertions than to owe it\r\nto descent, to being the \"accident of an accident\". But such a House as\r\nthis could not be pleasant to great noblemen. They could not like to be\r\nsecond in their own assembly (and yet that was their position from age\r\nto age) to a lawyer who was of yesterday,--whom everybody could\r\nremember without briefs, who had talked for \"hire,\" who had \"hungered\r\nafter six-and-eightpence\". Great peers did not gain glory from the\r\nHouse; on the contrary, they lost glory when they were in the House.\r\nThey devised two expedients to get out of this difficulty: they\r\ninvented proxies which enabled them to vote without being present,\r\nwithout being offended by vigour and invective, without being vexed by\r\nridicule, without leaving the rural mansion or the town palace where\r\nthey were demigods. And what was more effectual still, they used their\r\ninfluence in the House of Commons instead of the House of Lords. In\r\nthat indirect manner a rural potentate, who half returned two county\r\nmembers, and wholly returned two borough members, who perhaps gave\r\nseats to members of the Government, who possibly seated the leader of\r\nthe Opposition, became a much greater man than by sitting on his own\r\nbench, in his own House, hearing a Chancellor talk. The House of Lords\r\nwas a second-rate force, even when the peers were a first-rate force,\r\nbecause the greatest peers, those who had the greatest social\r\nimportance, did not care for their own House, or like it, but gained\r\ngreat part of their political power by a hidden but potent influence in\r\nthe competing House.\r\n\r\nWhen we cease to look at the House of Lords under its dignified aspect,\r\nand come to regard it under its strictly useful aspect, we find the\r\nliterary theory of the English Constitution wholly wrong, as usual.\r\nThis theory says that the House of Lords is a co-ordinate estate of the\r\nrealm, of equal rank with the House of Commons; that it is the\r\naristocratic branch, just as the Commons is the popular branch; and\r\nthat by the principle of our Constitution the aristocratic branch has\r\nequal authority with the popular branch. So utterly false is this\r\ndoctrine that it is a remarkable peculiarity, a capital excellence of\r\nthe British Constitution, that it contains a sort of Upper House, which\r\nis not of equal authority to the Lower House, yet still has some\r\nauthority. The evil of two co-equal Houses of distinct natures is\r\nobvious. Each House can stop all legislation, and yet some legislation\r\nmay be necessary. At this moment we have the best instance of this\r\nwhich could be conceived. The Upper House of our Victorian\r\nConstitution, representing the rich wool-growers, has disagreed with\r\nthe Lower Assembly, and most business is suspended. But for a most\r\ncurious stratagem, the machine of Government would stand still. Most\r\nConstitutions have committed this blunder. The two most remarkable\r\nRepublican institutions in the world commit it. In both the American\r\nand the Swiss Constitutions the Upper House has as much authority as\r\nthe second: it could produce the maximum of impediment--the dead-lock,\r\nif it liked; if it does not do so, it is owing not to the goodness of\r\nthe legal constitution, but to the discreetness of the members of the\r\nChamber. In both these Constitutions, this dangerous division is\r\ndefended by a peculiar doctrine with which I have nothing to do now. It\r\nis said that there must be in a Federal Government some institution,\r\nsome authority, some body possessing a veto in which the separate\r\nStates composing the Confederation are all equal. I confess this\r\ndoctrine has to me no self-evidence, and it is assumed, but not proved.\r\nThe State of Delaware is NOT equal in power or influence to the State\r\nof New York, and you cannot make it so by giving it an equal veto in an\r\nUpper Chamber. The history of such an institution is indeed most\r\nnatural. A little State will like, and must like, to see some token,\r\nsome memorial mark of its old independence preserved in the\r\nConstitution by which that independence is extinguished. But it is one\r\nthing for an institution to be natural, and another for it to be\r\nexpedient. If indeed it be that a Federal Government compels the\r\nerection of an Upper Chamber of conclusive and co-ordinate authority,\r\nit is one more in addition to the many other inherent defects of that\r\nkind of Government. It may be necessary to have the blemish, but it is\r\na blemish just as much.\r\n\r\nThere ought to be in every Constitution an available authority\r\nsomewhere. The sovereign power must be come-at-able. And the English\r\nhave made it so. The House of Lords, at the passing of the Reform Act\r\nof 1832, was as unwilling to concur with the House of Commons as the\r\nUpper Chamber at Victoria to concur with the Lower Chamber. But it did\r\nconcur. The Crown has the authority to create new peers; and the king\r\nof the day had promised the Ministry of the day to create them. The\r\nHouse of Lords did not like the precedent, and they passed the bill.\r\nThe power was not used, but its existence was as useful as its energy.\r\nJust as the knowledge that his men CAN strike makes a master yield in\r\norder that they may not strike, so the knowledge that their House could\r\nbe swamped at the will of the king--at the will of the people--made the\r\nLords yield to the people.\r\n\r\nFrom the Reform Act the function of the House of Lords has been altered\r\nin English history. Before that Act it was, if not a directing Chamber,\r\nat least a Chamber of Directors. The leading nobles, who had most\r\ninfluence in the Commons, and swayed the Commons, sat there.\r\nAristocratic influence was so powerful in the House of Commons, that\r\nthere never was any serious breach of unity. When the Houses\r\nquarrelled, it was as in the great Aylesbury case, about their\r\nrespective privileges, and not about the national policy. The influence\r\nof the nobility was then so potent, that it was not necessary to exert\r\nit. The English Constitution, though then on this point very different\r\nfrom what it now is, did not even then contain the blunder of the\r\nVictorian or of the Swiss Constitution. It had not two Houses of\r\ndistinct origin; it had two Houses of common origin--two Houses in\r\nwhich the predominant element was the same. The danger of discordance\r\nwas obviated by a latent unity.\r\n\r\nSince the Reform Act the House of Lords has become a revising and\r\nsuspending House. It can alter bills; it can reject bills on which the\r\nHouse of Commons is not yet thoroughly in earnest--upon which the\r\nnation is not yet determined. Their veto is a sort of hypothetical\r\nveto. They say, We reject your Bill for this once or these twice, or\r\neven these thrice: but if you keep on sending it up, at last we won't\r\nreject it. The House has ceased to be one of latent directors, and has\r\nbecome one of temporary rejectors and palpable alterers.\r\n\r\nIt is the sole claim of the Duke of Wellington to the name of a\r\nstatesman, that he presided over this change. He wished to guide the\r\nLords to their true position, and he did guide them. In 1846, in the\r\ncrisis of the Corn-Law struggle, and when it was a question whether the\r\nHouse of Lords should resist or yield, he wrote a very curious letter\r\nto the late Lord Derby:--\r\n\r\n\"For many years, indeed from the year 1830, when I retired from office,\r\nI have endeavoured to manage the House of Lords upon the principle on\r\nwhich I conceive that the institution exists in the Constitution of the\r\ncountry, that of Conservatism. I have invariably objected to all\r\nviolent and extreme measures, which is not exactly the mode of\r\nacquiring influence in a political party in England, particularly one\r\nin opposition to Government. I have invariably supported Government in\r\nParliament upon important occasions, and have always exercised my\r\npersonal influence to prevent the mischief of anything like a\r\ndifference or division between the two Houses,--of which there are some\r\nremarkable instances, to which I will advert here, as they will tend to\r\nshow you the nature of my management, and possibly, in some degree,\r\naccount for the extraordinary power which I have for so many years\r\nexercised, without any apparent claim to it.\" Upon finding the\r\ndifficulties in which the late King William was involved by a promise\r\nmade to create peers, the number, I believe, indefinite, I determined\r\nmyself, and I prevailed upon others, the number very large, to be\r\nabsent from the House in the discussion of the last stages of the\r\nReform Bill, after the negotiations had failed for the formation of a\r\nnew administration. This course gave at the time great dissatisfaction\r\nto the party; notwithstanding that I believe it saved the existence of\r\nthe House of Lords at the time, and the Constitution of the country.\r\n\r\n\"Subsequently, throughout the period from 1835 to 1841, I prevailed\r\nupon the House of Lords to depart from many principles and systems\r\nwhich they as well as I had adopted and voted on Irish tithes, Irish\r\ncorporations, and other measures, much to the vexation and annoyance of\r\nmany. But I recollect one particular measure, the union of the\r\nprovinces of Upper and Lower Canada, in the early stages of which I had\r\nspoken in opposition to the measure, and had protested against it; and\r\nin the last stages of it I prevailed upon the House to agree to, and\r\npass it, in order to avoid the injury to the public interests of a\r\ndispute between the Houses upon a question of such importance. Then I\r\nsupported the measures of the Government, and protected the servant of\r\nthe Government, Captain Elliot, in China. All of which tended to weaken\r\nmy influence with some of the party; others, possibly a majority, might\r\nhave approved of the course which I took. It was at the same time well\r\nknown that from the commencement at least of Lord Melbourne's\r\nGovernment, I was in constant communication with it, upon all military\r\nmatters, whether occurring at home or abroad, at all events. But\r\nlikewise upon many others.\"\r\n\r\n\"All this tended of course to diminish my influence in the Conservative\r\nparty, while it tended essentially to the ease and satisfaction of the\r\nsovereign, and to the maintenance of good order. At length came the\r\nresignation of the Government by Sir Robert Peel, in the month of\r\nDecember last, and the Queen desiring Lord John Russell to form an\r\nadministration. On the 12th of December the Queen wrote to me the letter\r\nof which I enclose the copy, and the copy of my answer of the same date;\r\nof which it appears that you have never seen copies, although I\r\ncommunicated them immediately to Sir Robert Peel. It was impossible for\r\nme to act otherwise than is indicated in my letter to the Queen. I am\r\nthe servant of the Crown and people. I have been paid and rewarded, and\r\nI consider myself retained; and that I can't do otherwise than serve as\r\nrequired, when I can do so without dishonour, that is to say, as long as\r\nI have health and strength to enable me to serve. But it is obvious that\r\nthere is, and there must be, an end of all connection and counsel\r\nbetween party and me. I might with consistency, and some may think that\r\nI ought to have declined to belong to Sir Robert Peel's Cabinet on the\r\nnight of the 20th of December. But my opinion is, that if I had, Sir\r\nRobert Peel's Government would not have been framed; that we should have\r\nhad ---- and ---- in office next morning.\r\n\r\n\"But, at all events, it is quite obvious that when that arrangement\r\ncomes, which sooner or later must come, there will be an end to all\r\ninfluence on my part over the Conservative party, if I should be so\r\nindiscreet as to attempt to exercise any. You will see, therefore, that\r\nthe stage is quite clear for you, and that you need not apprehend the\r\nconsequences of differing in opinion from me when you will enter upon\r\nit; as in truth I have, by my letter to the Queen of the 12th of\r\nDecember, put an end to the connection between the party and me, when\r\nthe party will be in opposition to her Majesty's Government.\"\r\n\r\n\"My opinion is, that the great object of all is that you should assume the\r\nstation, and exercise the influence, which I have so long exercised in\r\nthe House of Lords. The question is, how is that object to be attained?\r\nBy guiding their opinion and decision, or by following it? You will see\r\nthat I have endeavoured to guide their opinion, and have succeeded upon\r\nsome most remarkable occasions. But it has been by a good deal of\r\nmanagement.\r\n\r\n\"Upon the important occasion and question now before the House, I\r\npropose to endeavour to induce them to avoid to involve the country in\r\nthe additional difficulties of a difference of opinion, possibly a\r\ndispute between the Houses, on a question in the decision of which it\r\nhas been frequently asserted that their lordships had a personal\r\ninterest; which assertion, however false as affecting each of them\r\npersonally, could not be denied as affecting the proprietors of land in\r\ngeneral. I am aware of the difficulty, but I don't despair of carrying\r\nthe bill through. You must be the best judge of the course which you\r\nought to take, and of the course most likely to conciliate the\r\nconfidence of the House of Lords. My opinion is, that you should advise\r\nthe House to vote that which would tend most to public order, and would\r\nbe most beneficial to the immediate interests of the country.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the mode in which the House of Lords came to be what it now is,\r\na chamber with (in most cases) a veto of delay with (in most cases) a\r\npower of revision, but with no other rights or powers. The question we\r\nhave to answer is, \"The House of Lords being such, what is the use of\r\nthe Lords?\"\r\n\r\nThe common notion evidently fails, that it is a bulwark against\r\nimminent revolution. As the duke's letter in every line evinces, the\r\nwisest members, the guiding members of the House, know that the House\r\nmust yield to the people if the people is determined. The two\r\ncases--that of the Reform Act and the Corn Laws--were decisive cases.\r\nThe great majority of the Lords thought Reform revolution, Free-trade\r\nconfiscation, and the two together ruin. If they could ever have been\r\ntrusted to resist the people, they would then have resisted it. But in\r\ntruth it is idle to expect a second chamber--a chamber of\r\nnotables--ever to resist a popular chamber, a nation's chamber, when\r\nthat chamber is vehement and the nation vehement too. There is no\r\nstrength in it for that purpose. Every class chamber, every minority\r\nchamber, so to speak, feels weak and helpless when the nation is\r\nexcited. In a time of revolution there are but two powers, the sword\r\nand the people. The executive commands the sword; the great lesson\r\nwhich the First Napoleon taught the Parisian populace--the contribution\r\nhe made to the theory of revolutions at the 18th Brumaire--is now well\r\nknown. Any strong soldier at the head of the army can use the army. But\r\na second chamber cannot use it. It is a pacific assembly composed of\r\ntimid peers, aged lawyers, or, as abroad, clever litterateurs. Such a\r\nbody has no force to put down the nation, and if the nation will have\r\nit do something it must do it.\r\n\r\nThe very nature, too, as has been seen, of the Lords in the English\r\nConstitution, shows that it cannot stop revolution. The Constitution\r\ncontains an exceptional provision to prevent it stopping it. The\r\nexecutive, the appointee of the popular chamber and the nation, can\r\nmake new peers, and so create a majority in the peers; it can say to\r\nthe Lords, \"Use the powers of your House as we like, or you shall not\r\nuse them at all. We will find others to use them; your virtue shall go\r\nout of you if it is not used as we like, and stopped when we please.\"\r\nAn assembly under such a threat cannot arrest, and could not be\r\nintended to arrest, a determined and insisting executive.\r\n\r\nIn fact the House of Lords, as a House, is not a bulwark that will keep\r\nout revolution, but an index that revolution is unlikely. Resting as it\r\ndoes upon old deference, and inveterate homage, it shows that the spasm\r\nof new forces, the outbreak of new agencies, which we call revolution,\r\nis for the time simply impossible. So long as many old leaves linger on\r\nthe November trees, you know that there has been little frost and no\r\nwind; just so while the House of Lords retains much power, you may know\r\nthat there is no desperate discontent in the country, no wild agency\r\nlikely to cause a great demolition.\r\n\r\nThere used to be a singular idea that two chambers--a revising chamber\r\nand a suggesting chamber--were essential to a free Government. The\r\nfirst person who threw a hard stone--an effectually hitting\r\nstone--against the theory was one very little likely to be favourable\r\nto democratic influence, or to be blind to the use of aristocracy; it\r\nwas the present Lord Grey. He had to look at the matter practically. He\r\nwas the first great Colonial Minister of England who ever set himself\r\nto introduce representative institutions into ALL her capable colonies,\r\nand the difficulty stared him in the face that in those colonies there\r\nwere hardly enough good people for one assembly, and not near enough\r\ngood people for two assemblies. It happened--and most naturally\r\nhappened--that a second assembly was mischievous. The second assembly\r\nwas either the nominee of the Crown, which in such places naturally\r\nallied itself with better instructed minds, or was elected by people\r\nwith a higher property qualification--some peculiarly well-judging\r\npeople. Both these choosers choose the best men in the colony, and put\r\nthem into the second assembly. But thus the popular assembly was left\r\nwithout those best men. The popular assembly was denuded of those\r\nguides and those leaders who would have led and guided it best. Those\r\nsuperior men were put aside to talk to one another, and perhaps dispute\r\nwith one another; they were a concentrated instance of high but\r\nneutralised forces. They wished to do good, but they could do nothing.\r\nThe Lower House, with all the best people in the colony extracted, did\r\nwhat it liked. The democracy was strengthened rather than weakened by\r\nthe isolation of its best opponents in a weak position. As soon as\r\nexperience had shown this, or seemed to show it, the theory that two\r\nchambers were essential to a good and free Government vanished away.\r\n\r\nWith a perfect Lower House it is certain that an Upper House would be\r\nscarcely of any value. If we had an ideal House of Commons perfectly\r\nrepresenting the nation, always moderate, never passionate, abounding\r\nin men of leisure, never omitting the slow and steady forms necessary\r\nfor good consideration, it is certain that we should not need a higher\r\nchamber. The work would be done so well that we should not want any one\r\nto look over or revise it. And whatever is unnecessary in Government is\r\npernicious. Human life makes so much complexity necessary that an\r\nartificial addition is sure to do harm: you cannot tell where the\r\nneedless bit of machinery will catch and clog the hundred needful\r\nwheels; but the chances are conclusive that it will impede them some\r\nwhere, so nice are they and so delicate. But though beside an ideal\r\nHouse of Commons the Lords would be unnecessary, and therefore\r\npernicious, beside the actual House a revising and leisured legislature\r\nis extremely useful, if not quite necessary.\r\n\r\nAt present the chance majorities on minor questions in the House of\r\nCommons are subject to no effectual control. The nation never attends\r\nto any but the principal matters of policy and State. Upon these it\r\nforms that rude, rough, ruling judgment which we call public opinion;\r\nbut upon other things it does not think at all, and it would be useless\r\nfor it to think. It has not the materials for forming a judgment: the\r\ndetail of bills, the instrumental part of policy, the latent part of\r\nlegislation, are wholly out of its way. It knows nothing about them,\r\nand could not find time or labour for the careful investigation by\r\nwhich alone they can be apprehended. A casual majority of the House of\r\nCommons has therefore dominant power: it can legislate as it wishes.\r\nAnd though the whole House of Commons upon great subjects very fairly\r\nrepresents public opinion, and though its judgment upon minor questions\r\nis, from some secret excellencies in its composition, remarkably sound\r\nand good; yet, like all similar assemblies, it is subject to the sudden\r\naction of selfish combinations. There are said to be 200 \"members for\r\nthe railways\" in the present Parliament. If these 200 choose to combine\r\non a point which the public does not care for, and which they care for\r\nbecause it affects their purse, they are absolute. A formidable\r\nsinister interest may always obtain the complete command of a dominant\r\nassembly by some chance and for a moment, and it is therefore of great\r\nuse to have a second chamber of an opposite sort, differently composed,\r\nin which that interest in all likelihood will not rule.\r\n\r\nThe most dangerous of all sinister interests is that of the executive\r\nGovernment, because it is the most powerful. It is perfectly\r\npossible--it has happened and will happen again--that the Cabinet,\r\nbeing very powerful in the Commons, may inflict minor measures on the\r\nnation which the nation did not like, but which it did not understand\r\nenough to forbid. If, therefore, a tribunal of revision can be found in\r\nwhich the executive, though powerful, is less powerful, the Government\r\nwill be the better; the retarding chamber will impede minor instances\r\nof Parliamentary tyranny, though it will not prevent or much impede\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\nEvery large assembly is, moreover, a fluctuating body; it is not one\r\nhouse, so to say, but a set of houses; it is one set of men to-night\r\nand another to-morrow night. A certain unity is doubtless preserved by\r\nthe duty which the executive is supposed to undertake, and does\r\nundertake, of keeping a house; a constant element is so provided about\r\nwhich all sorts of variables accumulate and pass away. But even after\r\ndue allowance for the full weight of this protective machinery, our\r\nHouse of Commons is, as all such chambers must be, subject to sudden\r\nturns and bursts of feeling, because the members who compose it change\r\nfrom time to time. The pernicious result is perpetual in our\r\nlegislation; many Acts of Parliament are medleys of different motives,\r\nbecause the majority which passed one set of its clauses is different\r\nfrom that which passed another set.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest defect of the House of Commons is that it has no\r\nleisure. The life of the House is the worst of all lives--a life of\r\ndistracting routine. It has an amount of business brought before it\r\nsuch as no similar assembly ever has had. The British Empire is a\r\nmiscellaneous aggregate, and each bit of the aggregate brings its bit\r\nof business to the House of Commons. It is India one day and Jamaica\r\nthe next; then again China, and then Schleswig-Holstein. Our\r\nlegislation touches on all subjects, because our country contains all\r\ningredients. The mere questions which are asked of the Ministers run\r\nover half human affairs; the Private Bill Acts, the mere privilegia of\r\nour Government--subordinate as they ought to be--probably give the\r\nHouse of Commons more absolute work than the whole business, both\r\nnational and private, of any other assembly which has ever sat. The\r\nwhole scene is so encumbered with changing business, that it is hard to\r\nkeep your head in it.\r\n\r\nWhatever, too, may be the case hereafter, when a better system has been\r\nstruck out, at present the House does all the work of legislation, all\r\nthe detail, and all the clauses itself. One of the most helpless\r\nexhibitions of helpless ingenuity and wasted mind is a committee of the\r\nwhole House on a bill of many clauses which eager enemies are trying to\r\nspoil, and various friends are trying to mend. An Act of Parliament is\r\nat least as complex as a marriage settlement; and it is made much as a\r\nsettlement would be if it were left to the vote and settled by the\r\nmajor part of persons concerned, including the unborn children. There\r\nis an advocate for every interest, and every interest clamours for\r\nevery advantage. The executive Government by means of its disciplined\r\nforces, and the few invaluable members who sit and think, preserves\r\nsome sort of unity. But the result is very imperfect. The best test of\r\na machine is the work it turns out. Let any one who knows what legal\r\ndocuments ought to be, read first a will he has just been making and\r\nthen an Act of Parliament; he will certainly say, \"I would have\r\ndismissed my attorney if he had done my business as the legislature has\r\ndone the nation's business\". While the House of Commons is what it is,\r\na good revising, regulating and retarding House would be a benefit of\r\ngreat magnitude.\r\n\r\nBut is the House of Lords such a chamber? Does it do this work? This is\r\nalmost an undiscussed question. The House of Lords, for thirty years at\r\nleast, has been in popular discussion an accepted matter. Popular\r\npassion has not crossed the path, and no vivid imagination has been\r\nexcited to clear the matter up.\r\n\r\nThe House of Lords has the greatest merit which such a chamber can\r\nhave; it is POSSIBLE. It is incredibly difficult to get a revising\r\nassembly, because it is difficult to find a class of respected\r\nrevisers. A federal senate, a second House, which represents State\r\nunity, has this advantage; it embodies a feeling at the root of\r\nsociety--a feeling which is older than complicated politics, which is\r\nstronger a thousand times over than common political feelings--the\r\nlocal feeling. \"My shirt,\" said the Swiss state-right patriot, \"is\r\ndearer to me than my coat.\" Every State in the American Union would\r\nfeel that disrespect to the Senate was disrespect to itself.\r\nAccordingly, the Senate is respected; whatever may be the merits or\r\ndemerits of its action, it can act; it is real, independent, and\r\nefficient. But in common Governments it is fatally difficult to make an\r\nUNpopular entity powerful in a popular Government.\r\n\r\nIt is almost the same thing to say that the House of Lords is\r\nindependent. It would not be powerful, it would not be possible, unless\r\nit were known to be independent. The Lords are in several respects more\r\nindependent than the Commons; their judgment may not be so good a\r\njudgment, but it is emphatically their own judgment. The House of\r\nLords, as a body, is accessible to no social bribe. And this, in our\r\nday, is no light matter. Many members of the House of Commons, who are\r\nto be influenced by no other manner of corruption, are much influenced\r\nby this its most insidious sort. The conductors of the press and the\r\nwriters for it are worse--at least the more influential who come near\r\nthe temptation; for \"position,\" as they call it, for a certain intimacy\r\nwith the aristocracy, some of them would do almost anything and say\r\nalmost anything. But the Lords are those who give social bribes, and\r\nnot those who take them. They are above corruption because they are the\r\ncorruptors. They have no constituency to fear or wheedle; they have the\r\nbest means of forming a disinterested and cool judgment of any class in\r\nthe country. They have, too, leisure to form it. They have no\r\noccupations to distract them which are worth the name. Field sports are\r\nbut playthings, though some lords put an Englishman's seriousness into\r\nthem. Few Englishmen can bury themselves in science or literature; and\r\nthe aristocracy have less, perhaps, of that impetus than the middle\r\nclasses. Society is too correct and dull to be an occupation, as in\r\nother times and ages it has been. The aristocracy live in the fear of\r\nthe middle classes--of the grocer and the merchant. They dare not frame\r\na society of enjoyment as the French aristocracy once formed it.\r\nPolitics are the only occupation a peer has worth the name. He may\r\npursue them undistractedly. The House of Lords, besides independence to\r\nrevise judicially and position to revise effectually, has leisure to\r\nrevise intellectually.\r\n\r\nThese are great merits: and, considering how difficult it is to get a\r\ngood second chamber, and how much with our present first chamber we\r\nneed a second, we may well be thankful for them. But we must not permit\r\nthem to blind our eyes. Those merits of the Lords have faults close\r\nbeside them which go far to make them useless. With its wealth, its\r\nplace, and its leisure, the House of Lords would, on the very surface\r\nof the matter, rule us far more than it does if it had not secret\r\ndefects which hamper and weaken it.\r\n\r\nThe first of these defects is hardly to be called secret, though, on\r\nthe other hand, it is not well known. A severe though not unfriendly\r\ncritic of our institutions said that \"the cure for admiring the House\r\nof Lords was to go and look at it\"--to look at it not on a great party\r\nfield-day, or at a time of parade, but in the ordinary transaction of\r\nbusiness. There are perhaps ten peers in the House, possibly only six;\r\nthree is the quorum for transacting business. A few more may dawdle in\r\nor not dawdle in: those are the principal speakers, the lawyers (a few\r\nyears ago when Lyndhurst, Brougham, and Campbell were in vigour, they\r\nwere by far the predominant talkers) and a few statesmen whom every one\r\nknows. But the mass of the House is nothing. This is why orators\r\ntrained in the Commons detest to speak in the Lords. Lord Chatham used\r\nto call it the \"Tapestry\". The House of Commons is a scene of life if\r\never there was a scene of life. Every member in the throng, every atom\r\nin the medley, has his own objects (good or bad), his own purposes\r\n(great or petty); his own notions, such as they are, of what is; his\r\nown notions, such as they are, of what ought to be. There is a motley\r\nconfluence of vigorous elements, but the result is one and good. There\r\nis a \"feeling of the House,\" a \"sense\" of the House, and no one who\r\nknows anything of it can despise it. A very shrewd man of the world\r\nwent so far as to say that \"the House of Commons has more sense than\r\nany one in it\". But there is no such \"sense\" in the House of Lords,\r\nbecause there is no life. The Lower Chamber is a chamber of eager\r\npoliticians; the Upper (to say the least) of not eager ones.\r\n\r\nThis apathy is not, indeed, as great as the outside show would\r\nindicate. The committees of the Lords (as is well known) do a great\r\ndeal of work and do it very well. And such as it is, the apathy is very\r\nnatural. A House composed of rich men who can vote by proxy without\r\ncoming will not come very much.[5] But after every abatement the real\r\nindifference to their duties of most peers is a great defect, and the\r\napparent indifference is a dangerous defect. As far as politics go\r\nthere is profound truth in Lord Chesterfield's axiom, that \"the world\r\nmust judge of you by what you seem, not by what you are\". The world\r\nknows what you seem; it does not know what you are. An assembly--a\r\nrevising assembly especially--which does not assemble, which looks as\r\nif it does not care how it revises, is defective in a main political\r\ningredient. It may be of use, but it will hardly convince mankind that\r\nit is so.\r\n\r\n\r\n[5] In accordance with a recent resolution of the House of Lords\r\nproxies are now disused.--Note to second edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next defect is even more serious: it affects not simply the\r\napparent work of the House of Lords but the real work. For a revising\r\nlegislature, it is too uniformly made up. Errors are of various kinds;\r\nbut the constitution of the House of Lords only guards against a single\r\nerror--that of too quick change. The Lords--leaving out a few lawyers\r\nand a few outcasts--are all landowners of more or less wealth. They all\r\nhave more or less the opinions, the merits, the faults of that one\r\nclass. They revise legislation, as far as they do revise it,\r\nexclusively according to the supposed interests, the predominant\r\nfeelings, the inherited opinions, of that class. Since the Reform Act,\r\nthis uniformity of tendency has been very evident. The Lords have\r\nfelt--it would be harsh to say hostile, but still dubious, as to the\r\nnew legislation. There was a spirit in it alien to their spirit, and\r\nwhich when they could they have tried to cast out. That spirit is what\r\nhas been termed the \"modern spirit\". It is not easy to concentrate its\r\nessence in a phrase; it lives in our life, animates our actions,\r\nsuggests our thoughts. We all know what it means, though it would take\r\nan essay to limit it and define it. To this the Lords object; wherever\r\nit is concerned, they are not impartial revisers, but biassed revisers.\r\n\r\nThis singleness of composition would be no fault; it would be, or might\r\nbe, even a merit, if the criticism of the House of Lords, though a\r\nsuspicious criticism, were yet a criticism of great understanding. The\r\ncharacteristic legislation of every age must have characteristic\r\ndefects; it is the outcome of a character, of necessity faulty and\r\nlimited. It must mistake some kind of things; it must overlook some\r\nother. If we could get hold of a complemental critic, a critic who saw\r\nwhat the age did not see, and who saw rightly what the age mistook, we\r\nshould have a critic of inestimable value. But is the House of Lords\r\nthat critic? Can it be said that its unfriendliness to the legislation\r\nof the age is founded on a perception of what the age does not see, and\r\na rectified perception of what the age does see? The most extreme\r\npartisan, the most warm admirer of the Lords, if of fair and tempered\r\nmind, cannot say so. The evidence is too strong. On free trade, for\r\nexample, no one can doubt that the Lords--in opinion, in what they\r\nwished to do, and would have done, if they had acted on their own\r\nminds--were utterly wrong. This is the clearest test of the \"modern\r\nspirit\". It is easier here to be sure it is right than elsewhere.\r\nCommerce is like war; its result is patent. Do you make money or do you\r\nnot make it? There is as little appeal from figures as from battle. Now\r\nno one can doubt that England is a great deal better off because of\r\nfree trade; that it has more money, and that its money is diffused more\r\nas we should wish it diffused. In the one case in which we can\r\nunanswerably test the modern spirit, it was right, and the dubious\r\nUpper House--the House which would have rejected it, if possible--was\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\nThere is another reason. The House of Lords, being an hereditary\r\nchamber, cannot be of more than common ability. It may contain--it\r\nalmost always has contained, it almost always will\r\ncontain--extraordinary men. But its average born law-makers cannot be\r\nextraordinary. Being a set of eldest sons picked out by chance and\r\nhistory, it cannot be very wise. It would be a standing miracle if such\r\na chamber possessed a knowledge of its age superior to the other men of\r\nthe age; if it possessed a superior and supplemental knowledge; if it\r\ndescried what they did not discern, and saw truly that which they saw,\r\nindeed, but saw untruly.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty goes deeper. The task of revising, of adequately\r\nrevising the legislation of this age, is not only that which an\r\naristocracy has no facility in doing, but one which it has a difficulty\r\nin doing. Look at the statute book for 1865--the statutes at large for\r\nthe year. You will find, not pieces of literature, not nice and subtle\r\nmatters, but coarse matters, crude heaps of heavy business. They deal\r\nwith trade, with finance, with statute-law reform, with common-law\r\nreform; they deal with various sorts of business, but with business\r\nalways. And there is no educated human being less likely to know\r\nbusiness, worse placed for knowing business than a young lord. Business\r\nis really more agreeable than pleasure; it interests the whole mind,\r\nthe aggregate nature of man more continuously, and more deeply. But it\r\ndoes not look as if it did. It is difficult to convince a young man,\r\nwho can have the best of pleasure, that it will. A young lord just come\r\ninto 30,000 pounds a year will not, as a rule, care much for the law of\r\npatents, for the law of \"passing tolls,\" or the law of prisons. Like\r\nHercules, he may choose virtue, but hardly Hercules could choose\r\nbusiness. He has everything to allure him from it, and nothing to\r\nallure him to it. And even if he wish to give himself to business, he\r\nhas indifferent means. Pleasure is near him, but business is far from\r\nhim. Few things are more amusing than the ideas of a well-intentioned\r\nyoung man, who is born out of the business world, but who wishes to\r\ntake to business, about business. He has hardly a notion in what it\r\nconsists. It really is the adjustment of certain particular means to\r\nequally certain particular ends. But hardly any young man destitute of\r\nexperience is able to separate end and means. It seems to him a kind of\r\nmystery; and it is lucky if he do not think that the forms are the main\r\npart, and that the end is but secondary. There are plenty of business\r\nmen falsely so called, who will advise him so. The subject seems a kind\r\nof maze. \"What would you recommend me to READ?\" the nice youth asks;\r\nand it is impossible to explain to him that reading has nothing to do\r\nwith it, that he has not yet the original ideas in his mind to read\r\nabout; that administration is an art as painting is an art; and that no\r\nbook can teach the practice of either.\r\n\r\nFormerly this defect in the aristocracy was hidden by their own\r\nadvantages. Being the only class at ease for money and cultivated in\r\nmind they were without competition; and though they might not be, as a\r\nrule, and extraordinary ability excepted, excellent in State business,\r\nthey were the best that could be had. Even in old times, however, they\r\nsheltered themselves from the greater pressure of coarse work. They\r\nappointed a manager--a Peel or a Walpole, anything but an aristocrat in\r\nmanner or in nature--to act for them or manage for them. But now a\r\nclass is coming up trained to thought, full of money, and yet trained\r\nto business. As I write, two members of this class have been appointed\r\nto stations considerable in themselves, and sure to lead (if anything\r\nis sure in politics) to the Cabinet and power. This is the class of\r\nhighly-cultivated men of business who, after a few years, are able to\r\nleave business and begin ambition. As yet these men are few in public\r\nlife, because they do not know their own strength. It is like Columbus\r\nand the egg once again; a few original men will show it can be done,\r\nand then a crowd of common men will follow. These men know business\r\npartly from tradition, and this is much. There are University\r\nfamilies--families who talk of fellowships, and who invest their\r\nchildren's ability in Latin verses, as soon as they discover it; there\r\nused to be Indian families of the same sort, and probably will be again\r\nwhen the competitive system has had time to foster a new breed. Just so\r\nthere are business families to whom all that concerns money, all that\r\nconcerns administration, is as familiar as the air they breathe. All\r\nAmericans, it has been said, know business; it is in the air of their\r\ncountry. Just so certain classes know business here; and a lord can\r\nhardly know it. It is as great a difficulty to learn business in a\r\npalace as it is to learn agriculture in a park.\r\n\r\nTo one kind of business, indeed, this doctrine does not apply. There is\r\none kind of business in which our aristocracy have still, and are\r\nlikely to retain long, a certain advantage. This is the business of\r\ndiplomacy. Napoleon, who knew men well, would never, if he could help\r\nit, employ men of the Revolution in missions to the old courts; he\r\nsaid, \"They spoke to no one and no one spoke to them\"; and so they sent\r\nhome no information. The reason is obvious. The old-world diplomacy of\r\nEurope was largely carried on in drawing-rooms, and, to a great extent,\r\nof necessity still is so. Nations touch at their summits. It is always\r\nthe highest class which travels most, knows most of foreign nations,\r\nhas the least of the territorial sectarianism which calls itself\r\npatriotism, and is often thought to be so. Even here, indeed, in\r\nEngland the new trade-class is in real merit equal to the aristocracy.\r\nTheir knowledge of foreign things is as great, and their contact with\r\nthem often more. But, notwithstanding, the new race is not as\r\nserviceable for diplomacy as the old race. An ambassador is not simply\r\nan agent; he is also a spectacle. He is sent abroad for show as well as\r\nfor substance; he is to represent the Queen among foreign courts and\r\nforeign sovereigns. An aristocracy is in its nature better suited to\r\nsuch work; it is trained to the theatrical part of life;  it is fit for\r\nthat if it is fit for anything. But, with this exception, an\r\naristocracy is necessarily inferior in business to the classes nearer\r\nbusiness; and it is not, therefore, a suitable class, if we had our\r\nchoice of classes, out of which to frame a chamber for revising matters\r\nof business. It is indeed a singular example how natural business is to\r\nthe English race, that the House of Lords works as well as it does. The\r\ncommon appearance of the \"whole House\" is a jest--a dangerous anomaly,\r\nwhich Mr. Bright will sometimes use; but a great deal of substantial\r\nwork is done in \"Committees,\" and often very well done. The great\r\nmajority of the peers do none of their appointed work, and could do\r\nnone of it; but a minority--a minority never so large and never so\r\nearnest as in this age--do it, and do it well. Still no one, who\r\nexamines the matter without prejudice, can say that the work is done\r\nperfectly. In a country so rich in mind as England, far more\r\nintellectual power can be, and ought to be, applied to the revision of\r\nour laws.\r\n\r\nAnd not only does the House of Lords do its work imperfectly, but\r\noften, at least, it does it timidly. Being only a section of the\r\nnation, it is afraid of the nation. Having been used for years and\r\nyears, on the greatest matters to act contrary to its own judgment, it\r\nhardly knows when to act on that judgment. The depressing languor with\r\nwhich it damps an earnest young peer is at times ridiculous. \"When the\r\nCorn Laws are gone, and the rotten boroughs, why tease about Clause IX.\r\nin the Bill to regulate Cotton Factories?\" is the latent thought of\r\nmany peers. A word from the leaders, from \"the Duke,\" or Lord Derby, or\r\nLord Lyndhurst, will rouse on any matters the sleeping energies; but\r\nmost Lords are feeble and forlorn.\r\n\r\nThese grave defects would have been at once lessened, and in the course\r\nof years nearly effaced, if the House of Lords had not resisted the\r\nproposal of Lord Palmerston's first Government to create peers for\r\nlife. The expedient was almost perfect. The difficulty of reforming an\r\nold institution like the House of Lords is necessarily great; its\r\npossibility rests on continuous caste and ancient deference. And if you\r\nbegin to agitate about it, to bawl at meetings about it, that deference\r\nis gone, its particular charm lost, its reserved sanctity gone. But, by\r\nan odd fatality, there was in the recesses of the Constitution an old\r\nprerogative which would have rendered agitation needless--which would\r\nhave effected, without agitation, all that agitation could have\r\neffected. Lord Palmerston was--now that he is dead, and his memory can\r\nbe calmly viewed--as firm a friend to an aristocracy, as thorough an\r\naristocrat, as any in England; yet he proposed to use that power. If\r\nthe House of Lords had still been under the rule of the Duke of\r\nWellington, perhaps they would have acquiesced. The Duke would not\r\nindeed have reflected on all the considerations which a philosophic\r\nstatesman would have set out before him; but he would have been brought\r\nright by one of his peculiarities. He disliked, above all things, to\r\noppose the Crown. At a great crisis, at the crisis of the Corn Laws,\r\nwhat he considered was not what other people were thinking of, the\r\neconomical issue under discussion, the welfare of the country hanging\r\nin the balance, but the Queen's ease. He thought the Crown so superior\r\na part in the Constitution, that, even on vital occasions, he looked\r\nsolely--or said he looked solely--to the momentary comfort of the\r\npresent sovereign. He never was comfortable in opposing a conspicuous\r\nact of the Crown. It is very likely that, if the Duke had still been\r\nthe president of the House of Lords, they would have permitted the\r\nCrown to prevail in its well-chosen scheme. But the Duke was dead, and\r\nhis authority--or some of it--had fallen to a very different person.\r\nLord Lyndhurst had many great qualities: he had a splendid\r\nintellect--as great a faculty of finding truth as any one in his\r\ngeneration; but he had no love of truth. With this great faculty of\r\nfinding truth, he was a believer in error--in what his own party now\r\nadmit to be error--all his life through. He could have found the truth\r\nas a statesman just as he found it when a judge; but he never did find\r\nit. He never looked for it. He was a great partisan, and he applied a\r\ncapacity of argument, and a faculty of intellectual argument rarely\r\nequalled, to support the tenets of his party. The proposal to create\r\nlife peers was proposed by the antagonistic party--was at the moment\r\nlikely to injure his own party. To him this was a great opportunity.\r\nThe speech he delivered on that occasion lives in the memory of those\r\nwho heard it. His eyes did not at that time let him read, so he\r\nrepeated by memory, and quite accurately, all the black-letter\r\nauthorities, bearing on the question. So great an intellectual effort\r\nhas rarely been seen in an English assembly. But the result was\r\ndeplorable. Not by means of his black-letter authorities, but by means\r\nof his recognised authority and his vivid impression, he induced the\r\nHouse of Lords to reject the proposition of the Government. Lord\r\nLyndhurst said the Crown could not now create life peers, and so there\r\nare no life peers. The House of Lords rejected the inestimable, the\r\nunprecedented opportunity of being tacitly reformed. Such a chance does\r\nnot come twice. The life peers who would have been then introduced\r\nwould have been among the first men in the country. Lord Macaulay was\r\nto have been among the first; Lord Wensleydale--the most learned and\r\nnot the least logical of our lawyers--to be the very first. Thirty or\r\nforty such men, added judiciously and sparingly as years went on, would\r\nhave given to the House of Lords the very element which, as a\r\ncriticising chamber, it needs so much. It would have given it critics.\r\nThe most accomplished men in each department might then, without\r\nirrelevant considerations of family and of fortune, have been added to\r\nthe Chamber of Review. The very element which was wanted to the House\r\nof Lords was, as it were, by a constitutional providence, offered to\r\nthe House of Lords, and they refused it. By what species of effort that\r\nerror can be repaired I cannot tell; but, unless it is repaired, the\r\nintellectual capacity can never be what it would have been, will never\r\nbe what it ought to be, will never be sufficient for its work.\r\n\r\nAnother reform ought to have accompanied the creation of life peers.\r\nProxies ought to have been abolished. Some time or other the slack\r\nattendance of the House of Lords will destroy the House of Lords. There\r\nare occasions in which appearances are realities, and this is one of\r\nthem. The House of Lords on most days looks so unlike what it ought to\r\nbe, that most people will not believe it is what it ought to be. The\r\nattendance of considerate peers will, for obvious reasons, be larger\r\nwhen it can no longer be overpowered by the NON-attendance, by the\r\ncommissioned votes of inconsiderate peers. The abolition of proxies\r\nwould have made the House of Lords a real House; the addition of life\r\npeers would have made it a good House.\r\n\r\nThe greater of these changes would have most materially aided the House\r\nof Lords in the performance of its subsidiary functions. It always\r\nperhaps happens in a great nation, that certain bodies of sensible men\r\nposted prominently in its Constitution, acquire functions, and usefully\r\nexercise functions, which at the outset, no one expected from them, and\r\nwhich do not identify themselves with their original design. This has\r\nhappened to the House of Lords especially. The most obvious instance is\r\nthe judicial function. This is a function which no theorist would\r\nassign to a second chamber in a new Constitution, and which is matter\r\nof accident in ours. Gradually, indeed, the unfitness of the second\r\nchamber for judicial functions has made itself felt. Under our present\r\narrangements this function is not entrusted to the House of Lords, but\r\nto a Committee of the House of Lords. On one occasion only, the trial\r\nof O'Connell, the whole House, or some few in the whole House, wished\r\nto vote, and they were told they could not, or they would destroy the\r\njudicial prerogative. No one, indeed, would venture REALLY to place the\r\njudicial function in the chance majorities of a fluctuating assembly:\r\nit is so by a sleepy theory; it is not so in living fact. As a legal\r\nquestion, too, it is a matter of grave doubt whether there ought to be\r\ntwo supreme courts in this country--the Judicial Committee of the Privy\r\nCouncil, and (what is in fact though not in name) the Judicial\r\nCommittee of the House of Lords. Up to a very recent time, one\r\ncommittee might decide that a man was sane as to money, and the other\r\ncommittee might decide that he was insane as to land. This absurdity\r\nhas been cured; but the error from which it arose has not been\r\ncured--the error of having two supreme courts, to both of which as time\r\ngoes on, the same question is sure often enough to be submitted, and\r\neach of which is sure every now and then to decide it differently. I do\r\nnot reckon the judicial function of the House of Lords as one of its\r\ntrue subsidiary functions, first because it does not in fact exercise\r\nit, next because I wish to see it in appearance deprived of it. The\r\nsupreme court of the English people ought to be a great conspicuous\r\ntribunal, ought to rule all other courts, ought to have no competitor,\r\nought to bring our law into unity, ought not to be hidden beneath the\r\nrobes of a legislative assembly.\r\n\r\nThe real subsidiary functions of the House of Lords are, unlike its\r\njudicial functions, very analogous to its substantial nature. The first\r\nis the faculty of criticising the executive. An assembly in which the\r\nmass of the members have nothing to lose, where most have nothing to\r\ngain, where every one has a social position firmly fixed, where no one\r\nhas a constituency, where hardly any one cares for the minister of the\r\nday, is the very assembly in which to look for, from which to expect,\r\nindependent criticism. And in matter of fact we find it. The criticism\r\nof the Acts of late administrations by Lord Grey has been admirable.\r\nBut such criticism, to have its full value, should be many-sided. Every\r\nman of great ability puts his own mark on his own criticism; it will be\r\nfull of thought and feeling, but then it is of idiosyncratic thought\r\nand feeling. We want many critics of ability and knowledge in the Upper\r\nHouse--not equal to Lord Grey, for they would be hard to find--but like\r\nLord Grey. They should resemble him in impartiality; they should\r\nresemble him in clearness; they should most of all resemble him in\r\ntaking a supplemental view of a subject. There is an actor's view of a\r\nsubject, which (I speak of mature and discussed action--of Cabinet\r\naction) is nearly sure to include everything old and new--everything\r\nascertained and determinate. But there is also a bystander's view which\r\nis likely to omit some one or more of these old and certain elements,\r\nbut also to contain some new or distant matter, which the absorbed and\r\noccupied actor could not see. There ought to be many life peers in our\r\nsecondary chamber capable of giving us this higher criticism. I am\r\nafraid we shall not soon see them, but as a first step we should learn\r\nto wish for them.\r\n\r\nThe second subsidiary action of the House of Lords is even more\r\nimportant. Taking the House of Commons, not after possible but most\r\nunlikely improvements, but in matter of fact and as it stands, it is\r\noverwhelmed with work. The task of managing it falls upon the Cabinet,\r\nand that task is very hard. Every member of the Cabinet in the Commons\r\nhas to \"attend the House\"; to contribute by his votes, if not by his\r\nvoice, to the management of the House. Even in so small a matter as the\r\nEducation Department, Mr. Lowe, a consummate observer, spoke of the\r\ndesirability of finding a chief \"not exposed to the prodigious labour\r\nof attending the House of Commons\". It is all but necessary that\r\ncertain members of the Cabinet should be exempt from its toil, and\r\nuntouched by its excitement. But it is also necessary that they should\r\nhave the power of explaining their views to the nation; of being heard\r\nas other people are heard. There are various plans for so doing, which\r\nI may discuss a little in speaking of the House of Commons. But so much\r\nis evident: the House of Lords, for its own members, attains this\r\nobject; it gives them a voice, it gives them what no competing plan\r\ndoes give them--POSITION. The leisured members of the Cabinet speak in\r\nthe Lords with authority and power. They are not administrators with a\r\nright to speech--clerks (as is sometimes suggested) brought down to\r\nlecture a House, but not to vote in it; but they are the equals of\r\nthose they speak to; they speak as they like, and reply as they choose;\r\nthey address the House, not with the \"bated breath\" of subordinates,\r\nbut with the force and dignity of sure rank. Life peers would enable us\r\nto use this faculty of our Constitution more freely and more variously.\r\nIt would give us a larger command of able leisure; it would improve the\r\nLords as a political pulpit, for it would enlarge the list of its\r\nselect preachers.\r\n\r\nThe danger of the House of Commons is, perhaps, that it will be\r\nreformed too rashly; the danger of the House of Lords certainly is,\r\nthat it may never be reformed. Nobody asks that it should be so; it is\r\nquite safe against rough destruction, but it is not safe against inward\r\ndecay. It may lose its veto as the Crown has lost its veto. If most of\r\nits members neglect their duties, if all its members continue to be of\r\none class, and that not quite the best; if its doors are shut against\r\ngenius that cannot found a family, and ability which has not 5000\r\npounds a year, its power will be less year by year, and at last be\r\ngone, as so much kingly power is gone--no one knows how. Its danger is\r\nnot in assassination, but atrophy; not abolition, but decline.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNO. V.\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSE OF COMMONS.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: I reprint this chapter substantially as it was first\r\nwritten. It is too soon, as I have explained in the introduction, to\r\nsay what changes the late Reform Act will make in the House of Commons.]\r\n\r\nThe dignified aspect of the House of Commons is altogether secondary to\r\nits efficient use. It IS dignified: in a Government in which the most\r\nprominent parts are good because they are very stately, any prominent\r\npart, to be good at all, must be somewhat stately. The human\r\nimagination exacts keeping in government as much as in art; it will not\r\nbe at all influenced by institutions which do not match with those by\r\nwhich it is principally influenced. The House of Commons needs to be\r\nimpressive, and impressive it is: but its use resides not in its\r\nappearance, but in its reality. Its office is not to win power by awing\r\nmankind, but to use power in governing mankind.\r\n\r\nThe main function of the House of Commons is one which we know quite\r\nwell, though our common constitutional speech does not recognise it.\r\nThe House of Commons is an electoral chamber; it is the assembly which\r\nchooses our president. Washington and his fellow-politicians contrived\r\nan electoral college, to be composed (as was hoped) of the wisest\r\npeople in the nation, which, after due deliberation, was to choose for\r\npresident the wisest man in the nation. But that college is a sham; it\r\nhas no independence and no life. No one knows, or cares to know, who\r\nits members are. They never discuss, and never deliberate. They were\r\nchosen to vote that Mr. Lincoln be President, or that Mr. Breckenridge\r\nbe President; they do so vote, and they go home. But our House of\r\nCommons is a real choosing body; it elects the people it likes. And it\r\ndismisses whom it likes too. No matter that a few months since it was\r\nchosen to support Lord Aberdeen or Lord Palmerston; upon a sudden\r\noccasion it ousts the statesman to whom it at first adhered, and\r\nselects an opposite statesman whom it at first rejected. Doubtless in\r\nsuch cases there is a tacit reference to probable public opinion; but\r\ncertainly also there is much free will in the judgment of the Commons.\r\nThe House only goes where it thinks in the end the nation will follow;\r\nbut it takes its chance of the nation following or not following; it\r\nassumes the initiative, and acts upon its discretion or its caprice.\r\n\r\nWhen the American nation has chosen its President, its virtue goes out\r\nof it, and out of the Transmissive College through which it chooses.\r\nBut because the House of Commons has the power of dismissal in addition\r\nto the power of election, its relations to the Premier are incessant.\r\nThey guide him and he leads them. He is to them what they are to the\r\nnation. He only goes where he believes they will go after him. But he\r\nhas to take the lead; he must choose his direction, and begin the\r\njourney. Nor must he flinch. A good horse likes to feel the rider's\r\nbit; and a great deliberative assembly likes to feel that it is under\r\nworthy guidance. A Minister who succumbs to the House,--who\r\nostentatiously seeks its pleasure,--who does not try to regulate\r\nit,--who will not boldly point out plain errors to it, seldom thrives.\r\nThe great leaders of Parliament have varied much, but they have all had\r\na certain firmness. A great assembly is as soon spoiled by\r\nover-indulgence as a little child. The whole life of English politics\r\nis the action and reaction between the Ministry and the Parliament. The\r\nappointees strive to guide, and the appointers surge under the\r\nguidance. The elective is now the most important function of the House\r\nof Commons. It is most desirable to insist, and be tedious, on this,\r\nbecause our tradition ignores it. At the end of half the sessions of\r\nParliament, you will read in the newspapers, and you will hear even\r\nfrom those who have looked close at the matter and should know better,\r\n\"Parliament has done nothing this session. Some things were promised in\r\nthe Queen's speech, but they were only little things; and most of them\r\nhave not passed.\" Lord Lyndhurst used for years to recount the small\r\noutcomings of legislative achievement; and yet those were the days of\r\nthe first Whig Governments, who had more to do in legislation, and did\r\nmore, than any Government. The true answer to such harangues as Lord\r\nLyndhurst's by a Minister should have been in the first person. He\r\nshould have said firmly, \"Parliament has maintained ME, and that was\r\nits greatest duty; Parliament has carried on what, in the language of\r\ntraditional respect, we call the Queen's Government; it has maintained\r\nwhat wisely or unwisely it deemed the best executive of the English\r\nnation\". The second function of the House of Commons is what I may call\r\nan expressive function. It is its office to express the mind of the\r\nEnglish people on all matters which come before it. Whether it does so\r\nwell or ill I shall discuss presently. The third function of Parliament\r\nis what I may call--preserving a sort of technicality even in familiar\r\nmatters for the sake of distinctness--the teaching function. A great\r\nand open council of considerable men cannot be placed in the middle of\r\na society without altering that society. It ought to alter it for the\r\nbetter. It ought to teach the nation what it does not know. How far the\r\nHouse of Commons can so teach, and how far it does so teach, are\r\nmatters for subsequent discussion.\r\n\r\nFourthly, the House of Commons has what may be called an informing\r\nfunction--a function which though in its present form quite modern is\r\nsingularly analogous to a mediaeval function. In old times one office\r\nof the House of Commons was to inform the sovereign what was wrong. It\r\nlaid before the Crown the grievances and complaints of particular\r\ninterests. Since the publication of the Parliamentary debates a\r\ncorresponding office of Parliament is to lay these same grievances,\r\nthese same complaints, before the nation, which is the present\r\nsovereign. The nation needs it quite as much as the king ever needed\r\nit. A free people is indeed mostly fair, liberty practises men in a\r\ngive-and-take, which is the rough essence of justice. The English\r\npeople, possibly even above other free nations, is fair. But a free\r\nnation rarely can be--and the English nation is not--quick of\r\napprehension. It only comprehends what is familiar to it--what comes\r\ninto its own experience, what squares with its own thoughts. \"I never\r\nheard of such a thing in my life,\" the middle-class Englishman says,\r\nand he thinks he so refutes an argument. The common disputant cannot\r\nsay in reply that his experience is but limited, and that the assertion\r\nmay be true, though he had never met with anything at all like it. But\r\na great debate in Parliament does bring home something of this feeling.\r\nAny notion, any creed, any feeling, any grievance which can get a\r\ndecent number of English members to stand up for it, is felt by almost\r\nall Englishmen to be perhaps a false and pernicious opinion, but at any\r\nrate possible--an opinion within the intellectual sphere, an opinion to\r\nbe reckoned with. And it is an immense achievement. Practical\r\ndiplomatists say that a free Government is harder to deal with than a\r\ndespotic Government; you may be able to get the despot to hear the\r\nother side; his Ministers, men of trained intelligence, will be sure to\r\nknow what makes against them; and they MAY tell him. But a free nation\r\nnever hears any side save its own. The newspapers only repeat the side\r\ntheir purchasers like: the favourable arguments are set out,\r\nelaborated, illustrated; the adverse arguments maimed, misstated,\r\nconfused. The worst judge, they say, is a deaf judge; the most dull\r\nGovernment is a free Government on matters its ruling classes will not\r\nhear. I am disposed to reckon it as the second function of Parliament\r\nin point of importance, that to some extent it makes us hear what\r\notherwise we should not.\r\n\r\nLastly, there is the function of legislation, of which of course it\r\nwould be preposterous to deny the great importance, and which I only\r\ndeny to be AS important as the executive management of the whole State,\r\nor the political education given by Parliament to the whole nation.\r\nThere are, I allow, seasons when legislation is more important than\r\neither of these. The nation may be misfitted with its laws, and need to\r\nchange them: some particular corn law may hurt all industry, and it may\r\nbe worth a thousand administrative blunders to get rid of it. But\r\ngenerally the laws of a nation suit its life; special adaptations of\r\nthem are but subordinate; the administration and conduct of that life\r\nis the matter which presses most. Nevertheless, the statute-book of\r\nevery great nation yearly contains many important new laws, and the\r\nEnglish statute-book does so above any. An immense mass, indeed, of the\r\nlegislation is not, in the proper language of jurisprudence,\r\nlegislation at all. A law is a general command applicable to many\r\ncases. The \"special acts\" which crowd the statute-book and weary\r\nParliamentary committees are applicable to one case only. They do not\r\nlay down rules according to which railways shall be made, they enact\r\nthat such a railway shall be made from this place to that place, and\r\nthey have no bearing upon any other transaction. But after every\r\ndeduction and abatement, the annual legislation of Parliament is a\r\nresult of singular importance; were it not so, it could not be, as it\r\noften is considered, the sole result of its annual assembling.\r\n\r\nSome persons will perhaps think that I ought to enumerate a sixth\r\nfunction of the House of Commons--a financial function. But I do not\r\nconsider that, upon broad principle, and omitting legal technicalities,\r\nthe House of Commons has any special function with regard to financial\r\ndifferent from its functions with respect to other legislation. It is\r\nto rule in both, and to rule in both through the Cabinet. Financial\r\nlegislation is of necessity a yearly recurring legislation; but\r\nfrequency of occurrence does not indicate a diversity of nature or\r\ncompel an antagonism of treatment.\r\n\r\nIn truth, the principal peculiarity of the House of Commons in\r\nfinancial affairs is nowadays not a special privilege, but an\r\nexceptional disability. On common subjects any member can propose\r\nanything, but not on money--the Minister only can propose to tax the\r\npeople. This principle is commonly involved in mediaeval metaphysics as\r\nto the prerogative of the Crown, but it is as useful in the nineteenth\r\ncentury as in the fourteenth, and rests on as sure a principle. The\r\nHouse of Commons--now that it is the true sovereign, and appoints the\r\nreal executive--has long ceased to be the checking, sparing, economical\r\nbody it once was. It now is more apt to spend money than the Minister\r\nof the day. I have heard a very experienced financier say, \"If you want\r\nto raise a certain cheer in the House of Commons make a general\r\npanegyric on economy; if you want to invite a sure defeat, propose a\r\nparticular saving\". The process is simple. Every expenditure of public\r\nmoney has some apparent public object; those who wish to spend the\r\nmoney expatiate on that object; they say, \"What is 50,000 pounds to\r\nthis great country? Is this a time for cheese-paring objection? Our\r\nindustry was never so productive; our resources never so immense. What\r\nis 50,000 pounds in comparison with this great national interest?\" The\r\nmembers who are for the expenditure always come down; perhaps a\r\nconstituent or a friend who will profit by the outlay, or is keen on\r\nthe object, has asked them to attend; at any rate, there is a popular\r\nvote to be given, on which the newspapers--always philanthropic, and\r\nsometimes talked over--will be sure to make enconiums. The members\r\nagainst the expenditure rarely come down of themselves; why should they\r\nbecome unpopular without reason? The object seems decent; many of its\r\nadvocates are certainly sincere: a hostile vote will make enemies, and\r\nbe censured by the journals. If there were not some check, the\r\n\"people's house\" would soon outrun the people's money. That check is\r\nthe responsibility of the Cabinet for the national finance. If any one\r\ncould propose a tax, they might let the House spend it as it would, and\r\nwash their hands of the matter; but now, for whatever expenditure is\r\nsanctioned--even when it is sanctioned against the Ministry's wish--the\r\nMinistry must find the money. Accordingly, they have the strongest\r\nmotive to oppose extra outlay. They will have to pay the bill for it;\r\nthey will have to impose taxation, which is always disagreeable, or\r\nsuggest loans, which, under ordinary circumstances, are shameful. The\r\nMinistry is (so to speak) the bread-winner of the political family, and\r\nhas to meet the cost of philanthropy and glory, just as the head of a\r\nfamily has to pay for the charities of his wife and the toilette of his\r\ndaughters.\r\n\r\nIn truth, when a Cabinet is made the sole executive, it follows it must\r\nhave the sole financial charge, for all action costs money, all policy\r\ndepends on money, and it is in adjusting the relative goodness of\r\naction and policies that the executive is employed.\r\n\r\nFrom a consideration of these functions, it follows that we are ruled\r\nby the House of Commons; we are, indeed, so used to be so ruled, that\r\nit does not seem to be at all strange. But of all odd forms of\r\ngovernment, the oddest really is government by a PUBLIC MEETING. Here\r\nare 658 persons, collected from all parts of England, different in\r\nnature, different in interests, different in look, and language. If we\r\nthink what an empire the English is, how various are its components,\r\nhow incessant its concerns, how immersed in history its policy; if we\r\nthink what a vast information, what a nice discretion, what a\r\nconsistent will ought to mark the rulers of that empire, we shall be\r\nsurprised when we see them. We see a changing body of miscellaneous\r\npersons, sometimes few, sometimes many, never the same for an hour;\r\nsometimes excited, but mostly dull and half weary--impatient of\r\neloquence, catching at any joke as an alleviation. These are the\r\npersons who rule the British Empire--who rule England, who rule\r\nScotland, who rule Ireland, who rule a great deal of Asia, who rule a\r\ngreat deal of Polynesia, who rule a great deal of America, and\r\nscattered fragments everywhere.\r\n\r\nPaley said many shrewd things, but he never said a better thing than\r\nthat it was much harder to make men see a difficulty than comprehend\r\nthe explanation of it. The key to the difficulties of most discussed\r\nand unsettled questions is commonly in their undiscussed parts: they\r\nare like the background of a picture, which looks obvious, easy, just\r\nwhat any one might have painted, but which, in fact, sets the figures\r\nin their right position, chastens them, and makes them what they are.\r\nNobody will understand Parliament government who fancies it an easy\r\nthing, a natural thing, a thing not needing explanation. You have not a\r\nperception of the first elements in this matter till you know that\r\ngovernment by a CLUB is a standing wonder.\r\n\r\nThere has been a capital illustration lately how helpless many English\r\ngentlemen are when called together on a sudden. The Government, rightly\r\nor wrongly, thought fit to entrust the quarter-sessions of each county\r\nwith the duty of combating its cattle-plague; but the scene in most\r\n\"shire halls\" was unsatisfactory. There was the greatest difficulty in\r\ngetting, not only a right decision, but ANY decision, I saw one myself\r\nwhich went thus. The chairman proposed a very complex resolution, in\r\nwhich there was much which every one liked, and much which every one\r\ndisliked, though, of course, the favourite parts of some were the\r\nobjectionable parts to others. This resolution got, so to say, wedged\r\nin the meeting; everybody suggested amendments; one amendment was\r\ncarried which none were satisfied with, and so the matter stood over.\r\nIt is a saying in England, \"a big meeting never does anything\"; and yet\r\nwe are governed by the House of Commons--by \"a big meeting\".\r\n\r\nIt may be said that the House of Commons does not rule, it only elects\r\nthe rulers. But there must be something special about it to enable it\r\nto do that. Suppose the Cabinet were elected by a London club, what\r\nconfusion there would be, what writing and answering! \"Will you speak\r\nto So-and-So, and ask him to vote for my man?\" would be heard on every\r\nside. How the wife of A. and the wife of B. would plot to confound the\r\nwife of C. Whether the club elected under the dignified shadow of a\r\nqueen, or without the shadow, would hardly matter at all; if the\r\nsubstantial choice was in them, the confusion and intrigue would be\r\nthere too. I propose to begin this paper by asking, not why the House\r\nof Commons governs well? but the fundamental--almost unasked\r\nquestion--how the House of Commons comes to be able to govern at all?\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons can do work which the quarter-sessions or clubs\r\ncannot do, because it is an organised body, while quarter-sessions and\r\nclubs are unorganised. Two of the greatest orators in England--Lord\r\nBrougham and Lord Bolingbroke--spent much eloquence in attacking party\r\ngovernment. Bolingbroke probably knew what he was doing; he was a\r\nconsistent opponent of the power of the Commons; he wished to attack\r\nthem in a vital part. But Lord Brougham does not know; he proposes to\r\namend Parliamentary government by striking out the very elements which\r\nmake Parliamentary government possible. At present the majority of\r\nParliament obey certain leaders; what those leaders propose they\r\nsupport, what those leaders reject they reject. An old Secretary of the\r\nTreasury used to say, \"This is a bad case, an indefensible case. We\r\nmust apply our majority to this question.\" That secretary lived fifty\r\nyears ago, before the Reform Bill, when majorities were very blind, and\r\nvery \"applicable\". Nowadays, the power of leaders over their followers\r\nis strictly and wisely limited: they can take their followers but a\r\nlittle way, and that only in certain directions. Yet still there are\r\nleaders and followers. On the Conservative side of the House there are\r\nvestiges of the despotic leadership even now. A cynical politician is\r\nsaid to have watched the long row of county members, so fresh and\r\nrespectable-looking, and muttered,  \"By Jove, they are the finest brute\r\nvotes in Europe!\" But all satire apart, the principle of Parliament is\r\nobedience to leaders. Change your leader if you will, take another if\r\nyou will, but obey No. 1 while you serve No. 1, and obey No. 2 when you\r\nhave gone over to No. 2. The penalty of not doing so, is the penalty of\r\nimpotence. It is not that you will not be able to do any good, but you\r\nwill not be able to do anything at all. If everybody does what he\r\nthinks right, there will be 657 amendments to every motion, and none of\r\nthem will be carried or the motion either.\r\n\r\nThe moment, indeed, that we distinctly conceive that the House of\r\nCommons is mainly and above all things an elective assembly, we at once\r\nperceive that party is of its essence. There never was an election\r\nwithout a party. You cannot get a child into an asylum without a\r\ncombination. At such places you may see \"Vote for orphan A.\" upon a\r\nplacard, and \"Vote for orphan B. (also an idiot!!!)\" upon a banner, and\r\nthe party of each is busy about its placard and banner. What is true at\r\nsuch minor and momentary elections must be much more true in a great\r\nand constant election of rulers. The House of Commons lives in a state\r\nof perpetual potential choice; at any moment it can choose a ruler and\r\ndismiss a ruler. And therefore party is inherent in it, is bone of its\r\nbone, and breath of its breath.\r\n\r\nSecondly, though the leaders of party no longer have the vast patronage\r\nof the last century with which to bribe, they can coerce by a threat\r\nfar more potent than any allurement--they can dissolve. This is the\r\nsecret which keeps parties together. Mr. Cobden most justly said: \"He\r\nhad never been able to discover what was the proper moment, according\r\nto members of Parliament, for a dissolution. He had heard them say they\r\nwere ready to vote for everything else, but he had never heard them say\r\nthey were ready to vote for that.\" Efficiency in an assembly requires a\r\nsolid mass of steady votes; and these are COLLECTED by a deferential\r\nattachment to particular men, or by a belief in the principles those\r\nmen represent, and they are MAINTAINED by fear of those men--by the\r\nfear that if you vote against them, you may yourself soon not have a\r\nvote at all.\r\n\r\nThirdly, it may seem odd to say so, just after inculcating that party\r\norganisation is the vital principle of representative government, but\r\nthat organisation is permanently efficient, because it is not composed\r\nof warm partisans. The body is eager, but the atoms are cool. If it\r\nwere otherwise, Parliamentary government would become the worst of\r\ngovernments--a sectarian government. The party in power would go all\r\nthe lengths their orators proposed--all that their formulae enjoined,\r\nas far as they had ever said they would go. But the partisans of the\r\nEnglish Parliament are not of such a temper. They are Whigs, or\r\nRadicals, or Tories, but they are much else too. They are common\r\nEnglishmen, and, as Father Newman complains, \"hard to be worked up to\r\nthe dogmatic level\". They are not eager to press the tenets of their\r\nparty to impossible conclusions. On the contrary, the way to lead\r\nthem--the best and acknowledged way--is to affect a studied and\r\nillogical moderation. You may hear men say, \"Without committing myself\r\nto the tenet that 3 + 2 make 5, though I am free to admit that the\r\nhonourable member for Bradford has advanced very grave arguments in\r\nbehalf of it, I think I may, with the permission of the Committee,\r\nassume that 2 + 3 do not make 4, which will be a sufficient basis for\r\nthe important propositions which I shall venture to submit on the\r\npresent occasion.\" This language is very suitable to the greater part\r\nof the House of Commons. Most men of business love a sort of twilight.\r\nThey have lived all their lives in an atmosphere of probabilities and\r\nof doubt, where nothing is very clear, where there are some chances for\r\nmany events, where there is much to be said for several courses, where\r\nnevertheless one course must be determinedly chosen and fixedly adhered\r\nto. They like to hear arguments suited to this intellectual haze. So\r\nfar from caution or hesitation in the statement of the argument\r\nstriking them as an indication of imbecility, it seems to them a sign\r\nof practicality. They got rich themselves by transactions of which they\r\ncould not have stated the argumentative ground--and all they ask for is\r\na distinct though moderate conclusion, that they can repeat when asked;\r\nsomething which they feel NOT to be abstract argument, but abstract\r\nargument diluted and dissolved in real life. \"There seem to me,\" an\r\nimpatient young man once said, \"to be no stay in Peel's arguments.\" And\r\nthat was why Sir Robert Peel was the best leader of the Commons in our\r\ntime; we like to have the rigidity taken out of an argument, and the\r\nsubstance left. Nor indeed, under our system of government, are the\r\nleaders themselves of the House of Commons, for the most part, eager to\r\ncarry party conclusions too far. They are in contact with reality. An\r\nOpposition, on coming into power, is often like a speculative merchant\r\nwhose bills become due. Ministers have to make good their promises, and\r\nthey find a difficulty in so doing. They have said the state of things\r\nis so and so, and if you give us the power we will do thus and thus.\r\nBut when they come to handle the official documents, to converse with\r\nthe permanent under-secretary--familiar with disagreeable facts, and\r\nthough in manner most respectful, yet most imperturbable in\r\nopinion--very soon doubts intervene. Of course, something must be done;\r\nthe speculative merchant cannot forget his bills; the late Opposition\r\ncannot, in office, forget those sentences which terrible admirers in\r\nthe country still quote. But just as the merchant asks his debtor,\r\n\"Could you not take a bill at four months?\" so the new Minister says to\r\nthe permanent under-secretary, \"Could you not suggest a middle course?\r\nI am of course not bound by mere sentences used in debate; I have never\r\nbeen accused of letting a false ambition of consistency warp my\r\nconduct; but,\" etc., etc. And the end always is that a middle course is\r\ndevised which LOOKS as much as possible like what was suggested in\r\nopposition, but which IS as much as possible what patent facts--facts\r\nwhich seem to live in the office, so teasing and unceasing are\r\nthey--prove ought to be done. Of all modes of enforcing moderation on a\r\nparty, the best is to contrive that the members of that party shall be\r\nintrinsically moderate, careful, and almost shrinking men; and the next\r\nbest to contrive that the leaders of the party, who have protested most\r\nin its behalf, shall be placed in the closest contact with the actual\r\nworld. Our English system contains both contrivances; it makes party\r\ngovernment permanent and possible in the sole way in which it can be\r\nso, by making it mild.\r\n\r\nBut these expedients, though they sufficiently remove the defects which\r\nmake a common club or quarter-sessions impotent, would not enable the\r\nHouse of Commons to govern England. A representative public meeting is\r\nsubject to a defect over and above those of other public meetings. It\r\nmay not be independent. The constituencies may not let it alone. But if\r\nthey do not, all the checks which have been enumerated upon the evils\r\nof a party organisation would be futile. The feeling of a constituency\r\nis the feeling of a dominant party, and that feeling is elicited,\r\nstimulated, sometimes even manufactured by the local political agent.\r\nSuch an opinion could not be moderate; could not be subject to\r\neffectual discussion; could not be in close contact with pressing\r\nfacts; could not be framed under a chastening sense of near\r\nresponsibility; could not be formed as those form their opinions who\r\nhave to act upon them. Constituency government is the precise opposite\r\nof Parliamentary government. It is the government of immoderate persons\r\nfar from the scene of action, instead of the government of moderate\r\npersons close to the scene of action; it is the judgment of persons\r\njudging in the last resort and without a penalty, in lieu of persons\r\njudging in fear of a dissolution, and ever conscious that they are\r\nsubject to an appeal.\r\n\r\nMost persons would admit these conditions of Parliamentary government\r\nwhen they read them, but two at least of the most prominent ideas in\r\nthe public mind are inconsistent with them. The scheme to which the\r\narguments of our demagogues distinctly tend, and the scheme to which\r\nthe predilections of some most eminent philosophers cleave, are both\r\nso. They would not only make Parliamentary government work ill, but\r\nthey would prevent its working at all; they would not render it bad,\r\nfor they would make it impossible.\r\n\r\nThe first of these is the ultra-democratic theory. This theory demands\r\nthat every man of twenty-one years of age (if not every woman too)\r\nshould have an equal vote in electing Parliament. Suppose that last\r\nyear there were twelve million adult males in England. Upon this theory\r\neach man is to have one twelve-millionth share in electing a\r\nParliament; the rich and wise are not to have, by explicit law, more\r\nvotes than the poor and stupid; nor are any latent contrivances to give\r\nthem an influence equivalent to more votes. The machinery for carrying\r\nout such a plan is very easy. At each census the country ought to be\r\ndivided into 658 electoral districts, in each of which the number of\r\nadult males should be the same; and these districts ought to be the\r\nonly constituencies, and elect the whole Parliament. But if the above\r\nprerequisites are needful for Parliamentary government, that Parliament\r\nwould not work.\r\n\r\nSuch a Parliament could not be composed of moderate men. The electoral\r\ndistricts would be, some of them, in purely agricultural places, and in\r\nthese the parson and the squire would have almost unlimited power. They\r\nwould be able to drive or send to the poll an entire labouring\r\npopulation. These districts would return an unmixed squirearchy. The\r\nscattered small towns which now send so many members to Parliament,\r\nwould be lost in the clownish mass; their votes would send to\r\nParliament no distinct members. The agricultural part of England would\r\nchoose its representatives from quarter-sessions exclusively. On the\r\nother hand a large part of the constituencies would be town districts,\r\nand these would send up persons representing the beliefs or unbeliefs\r\nof the lowest classes in their towns. They would, perhaps, be divided\r\nbetween the genuine representatives of the artisans--not possibly of\r\nthe best of the artisans, who are a select and intellectual class, but\r\nof the common order of workpeople--and the merely pretended members for\r\nthat class whom I may call the members for the public-houses. In all\r\nbig towns in which there is electioneering these houses are the centres\r\nof illicit corruption and illicit management. There are pretty good\r\nrecords of what that corruption and management are, but there is no\r\nneed to describe them here. Everybody will understand what sort of\r\nthings I mean, and the kind of unprincipled members that are returned\r\nby them. Our new Parliament, therefore, would be made up of two sorts\r\nof representatives from the town lowest class, and one sort of\r\nrepresentatives from the agricultural lowest class. The genuine\r\nrepresentatives of the country would be men of one marked sort, and the\r\ngenuine representatives for the county men of another marked sort, but\r\nvery opposite: one would have the prejudices of town artisans, and the\r\nother the prejudices of county magistrates. Each class would speak a\r\nlanguage of its own; each would be unintelligible to the other; and the\r\nonly thriving class would be the immoral representatives, who were\r\nchosen by corrupt machination, and who would probably get a good profit\r\non the capital they laid out in that corruption. If it be true that a\r\nParliamentary government is possible only when the overwhelming\r\nmajority of the representatives are men essentially moderate, of no\r\nmarked varieties, free from class prejudices, this ultra-democratic\r\nParliament could not maintain that government, for its members would be\r\nremarkable for two sorts of moral violence and one sort of immoral.\r\n\r\nI do not for a moment rank the scheme of Mr. Hare with the scheme of\r\nthe ultra-democrats. One can hardly help having a feeling of romance\r\nabout it. The world seems growing young when grave old lawyers and\r\nmature philosophers propose a scheme promising so much. It is from\r\nthese classes that young men suffer commonly the chilling demonstration\r\nthat their fine plans are opposed to rooted obstacles, that they are\r\nrepetitions of other plans which failed long ago, and that we must be\r\ncontent with the very moderate results of tried machinery. But Mr. Hare\r\nand Mr. Mill offer as the effect of their new scheme results as large\r\nand improvements as interesting as a young enthusiast ever promised to\r\nhimself in his happiest mood.\r\n\r\nI do not give any weight to the supposed impracticability of Mr. Hare's\r\nscheme because it is new. Of course it cannot be put in practice till\r\nit is old. A great change of this sort happily cannot be sudden; a free\r\npeople cannot be confused by new institutions which they do not\r\nunderstand, for they will not adopt them till they understand them. But\r\nif Mr. Hare's plan would accomplish what its friends say, or half what\r\nthey say, it would be worth working for, if it were not adopted till\r\nthe year 1966. We ought incessantly to popularise the principle by\r\nwriting; and, what is better than writing, small preliminary bits of\r\nexperiment. There is so much that is wearisome and detestable in all\r\nother election machineries, that I well understand, and wish I could\r\nshare, the sense of relief with which the believers in this scheme\r\nthrow aside all their trammels, and look to an almost ideal future when\r\nthis captivating plan is carried.\r\n\r\nMr. Hare's scheme cannot be satisfactorily discussed in the elaborate\r\nform in which he presents it. No common person readily apprehends all\r\nthe details in which, with loving care, he has embodied it. He was so\r\nanxious to prove what could be done, that he has confused most people\r\nas to what it is. I have heard a man say, \"He never could remember it\r\ntwo days running\". But the difficulty which I feel is fundamental, and\r\nwholly independent of detail.\r\n\r\nThere are two modes in which constituencies may be made. First, the law\r\nmay make them, as in England and almost everywhere: the law may say\r\nsuch and such qualifications shall give a vote for constituency X;\r\nthose who have that qualification shall BE constituency X. These are\r\nwhat we may call compulsory constituencies, and we know all about them.\r\nOr, secondly, the law may leave the electors themselves to make them.\r\nThe law may say all the adult males of a country shall vote, or those\r\nmales who can read and write, or those who have 50 pounds a year, or\r\nany persons any way defined, and then leave those voters to group\r\nthemselves as they like. Suppose there were 658,000 voters to elect the\r\nHouse of Commons; it is possible for the legislature to say, \"We do not\r\ncare how you combine. On a given day let each set of persons give\r\nnotice in what group they mean to vote; if every voter gives notice,\r\nand every one looks to make the most of his vote, each group will have\r\njust 1000. But the law shall not make this necessary--it shall take the\r\n658 most numerous groups, no matter whether they have 2000, or 1000, or\r\n900, or 800 votes--the most numerous groups, whatever their number may\r\nbe; and these shall be the constituencies of the nation.\" These are\r\nvoluntary constituencies, if I may so call them; the simplest kind of\r\nvoluntary constituencies. Mr. Hare proposes a far more complex kind;\r\nbut to show the merits and demerits of the voluntary principle the\r\nsimplest form is much the best.\r\n\r\nThe temptation to that principle is very plain. Under the compulsory\r\nform of constituency the votes of the minorities are thrown away. In\r\nthe city of London, now, there are many Tories, but all the members are\r\nWhigs; every London Tory, therefore, is by law and principle\r\nmisrepresented: his city sends to Parliament not the member whom he\r\nwished to have, but the member he wished not to have. But upon the\r\nvoluntary system the London Tories, who are far more than 1000 in\r\nnumber, may combine; they may make a constituency, and return a member.\r\nIn many existing constituencies the disfranchisement of minorities is\r\nhopeless and chronic. I have myself had a vote for an agricultural\r\ncounty for twenty years, and I am a Liberal; but two Tories have always\r\nbeen returned, and all my life will be returned. As matters now stand,\r\nmy vote is of no use. But if I could combine with 1000 other Liberals\r\nin that and other Conservative counties, we might choose a Liberal\r\nmember.\r\n\r\nAgain, this plan gets rid of all our difficulties as to the size of\r\nconstituencies. It is said to be unreasonable that Liverpool should\r\nreturn only the same number of members as King's Lynn or Lyme Regis;\r\nbut upon the voluntary plan, Liverpool could come down to King's Lynn.\r\nThe Liberal minority in King's Lynn could communicate with the Liberal\r\nminority in Liverpool, and make up 1000; and so everywhere. The numbers\r\nof popular places would gain what is called their legitimate advantage;\r\nthey would, when constituencies are voluntarily made, be able to make,\r\nand be willing to make the greatest number of constituencies.\r\n\r\nAgain, the admirers of a great man could make a worthy constituency for\r\nhim. As it is, Mr. Mill was returned by the electors of Westminster;\r\nand they have never, since they had members, done themselves so great\r\nan honour. But what did the electors of Westminster know of Mr. Mill?\r\nWhat fraction of his mind could be imagined by any percentage of their\r\nminds? A great deal of his genius most of them would not like. They\r\nmeant to do homage to mental ability, but it was the worship of an\r\nunknown God--if ever there was such a thing in this world. But upon the\r\nvoluntary plan, one thousand out of the many thousand students of Mr.\r\nMill's book could have made an appreciating constituency for him.\r\n\r\nI could reckon other advantages, but I have to object to the scheme,\r\nnot to recommend it. What are the counterweights which overpower these\r\nmerits? I reply that the voluntary composition of constituencies\r\nappears to me inconsistent with the necessary prerequisites of\r\nParliamentary government as they have been just laid down.\r\n\r\nUnder the voluntary system, the crisis of politics is not the election\r\nof the member, but the making the constituency. President-making is\r\nalready a trade in America, and constituency-making would, under the\r\nvoluntary plan, be a trade here. Every party would have a numerical\r\nproblem to solve. The leaders would say, \"We have 350,000 votes, we\r\nmust take care to have 350 members\"; and the only way to obtain them is\r\nto organise. A man who wanted to compose part of a Liberal constituency\r\nmust not himself hunt for 1000 other Liberals; if he did, after writing\r\n10000 letters, he would probably find he was making part of a\r\nconstituency of 100, all whose votes would be thrown away, the\r\nconstituency being too small to be reckoned. Such a Liberal must write\r\nto the great Registration Association in Parliament Street; he must\r\ncommunicate with its able managers, and they would soon use his vote\r\nfor him. They would say, \"Sir, you are late; Mr. Gladstone, sir, is\r\nfull. He got his 1000 last year. Most of the gentlemen you read of in\r\nthe papers are full. As soon as a gentleman makes a nice speech, we get\r\na heap of letters to say, 'Make us into that gentleman's constituency'.\r\nBut we cannot do that. Here is our list. If you do not want to throw\r\nyour vote away, you must be guided by us: here are three very\r\nsatisfactory gentlemen (and one is an Honourable): you may vote for\r\neither of these, and we will write your name down; but if you go voting\r\nwildly, you'll be thrown out altogether.\"\r\n\r\nThe evident result of this organisation would be the return of party\r\nmen mainly. The member-makers would look, not for independence, but for\r\nsubservience--and they could hardly be blamed for so doing. They are\r\nagents for the Liberal party; and, as such, they should be guided by\r\nwhat they take to be the wishes of their principal. The mass of the\r\nLiberal party wishes measure A, measure B, measure C. The managers of\r\nthe registration--the skilled manipulators--are busy men. They would\r\nsay, \"Sir, here is our card; if you want to get into Parliament on our\r\nside, you must go for that card; it was drawn up by Mr. Lloyd; he used\r\nto be engaged on railways, but since they passed this new voting plan,\r\nwe get him to attend to us; it is a sound card; stick to that and you\r\nwill be right\". Upon this (in theory) voluntary plan, you would get\r\ntogether a set of members bound hard and fast with party bands and\r\nfetters, infinitely tighter than any members now.\r\n\r\nWhoever hopes anything from desultory popular action if matched against\r\nsystematised popular action, should consider the way in which the\r\nAmerican President is chosen. The plan was that the citizens at large\r\nshould vote for the statesman they liked best. But no one does anything\r\nof the sort. They vote for the ticket made by \"the caucus,\" and the\r\ncaucus is a sort of representative meeting which sits voting and voting\r\ntill they have cut out all the known men against whom much is to be\r\nsaid, and agreed on some unknown man against whom there is nothing\r\nknown, and therefore nothing to be alleged. Caucuses, or their\r\nequivalent, would be far worse here in constituency-making than there\r\nin President-making, because on great occasions the American nation can\r\nfix on some one great man whom it knows, but the English nation could\r\nnot fix on 658 great men and choose them. It does not know so many, and\r\nif it did, would go wrong in the difficulties of the manipulation.\r\n\r\nBut though a common voter could only be ranged in an effectual\r\nconstituency, and a common candidate only reach a constituency by\r\nobeying the orders of the political election-contrivers upon his side,\r\ncertain voters and certain members would be quite independent of both.\r\nThere are organisations in this country which would soon make a set of\r\nconstituencies for themselves. Every chapel would be an office for\r\nvote-transferring before the plan had been known three months. The\r\nChurch would be much slower in learning it and much less handy in using\r\nit; but would learn. At present the Dissenters are a most energetic and\r\nvaluable component of the Liberal party; but under the voluntary plan\r\nthey would not be a component--they would be a separate, independent\r\nelement. We now propose to group boroughs; but then they would combine\r\nchapels. There would be a member for the Baptist congregation of\r\nTavistock, cum Totnes, cum, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nThe full force of this cannot be appreciated except by referring to the\r\nformer proof that the mass of a Parliament ought to be men of moderate\r\nsentiments, or they will elect an immoderate Ministry, and enact\r\nviolent laws. But upon the plan suggested, the House would be made up\r\nof party politicians selected by a party committee, chained to that\r\ncommittee and pledged to party violence, and of characteristic, and\r\ntherefore immoderate representatives, for every \"ism\" in all England.\r\nInstead of a deliberate assembly of moderate and judicious men, we\r\nshould have a various compound of all sorts of violence.\r\n\r\nI may seem to be drawing a caricature, but I have not reached the\r\nworst. Bad as these members would be, if they were left to\r\nthemselves--if, in a free Parliament, they were confronted with the\r\nperils of government, close responsibility might improve them and make\r\nthem tolerable. But they would not be left to themselves. A voluntary\r\nconstituency will nearly always be a despotic constituency. Even in the\r\nbest case, where a set of earnest men choose a member to expound their\r\nearnestness, they will look after him to see that he does expound it.\r\nThe members will be like the minister of a dissenting congregation.\r\nThat congregation is collected by a unity of sentiment in doctrine A,\r\nand the preacher is to preach doctrine A; if he does not, he is\r\ndismissed. At present the member is free because the constituency is\r\nnot in earnest; no constituency has an acute, accurate doctrinal creed\r\nin politics. The law made the constituencies by geographical divisions;\r\nand they are not bound together by close unity of belief. They have\r\nvague preferences for particular doctrines; and that is all. But a\r\nvoluntary constituency would be a church with tenets; it would make its\r\nrepresentative the messenger of its mandates, and the delegate of its\r\ndeterminations. As in the case of a dissenting congregation, one great\r\nminister sometimes rules it, while ninety-nine ministers in the hundred\r\nare ruled by it, so here one noted man would rule his electors, but the\r\nelectors would rule all the others.\r\n\r\nThus, the members for a good voluntary constituency would be hopelessly\r\nenslaved, because of its goodness; but the members for a bad voluntary\r\nconstituency would be yet more enslaved because of its badness. The\r\nmakers of these constituencies would keep the despotism in their own\r\nhands. In America there is a division of politicians into wire-pullers\r\nand blowers; under the voluntary system the member of Parliament would\r\nbe the only momentary mouth-piece--the impotent blower; while the\r\nconstituency-maker would be the latent wire-puller--the constant\r\nautocrat. He would write to gentlemen in Parliament, and say, \"You were\r\nelected upon 'the Liberal ticket'; and if you deviate from that ticket\r\nyou cannot be chosen again\". And there would be no appeal for a\r\ncommon-minded man. He is no more likely to make a constituency for\r\nhimself than a mole is likely to make a planet.\r\n\r\nIt may indeed be said that against a septennial Parliament such\r\nmachinations would be powerless; that a member elected for seven years\r\nmight defy the remonstrances of an earnest constituency, or the\r\nimprecations of the latent manipulators. But after the voluntary\r\ncomposition of constituencies, there would soon be but short-lived\r\nParliaments. Earnest constituencies would exact frequent elections;\r\nthey would not like to part with their virtue for a long period; it\r\nwould anger them to see it used contrary to their wishes, amid\r\ncircumstances which at the election no one thought of. A seven years'\r\nParliament is often chosen in one political period, lasts through a\r\nsecond, and is dissolved in a third. A constituency collected by law\r\nand on compulsion endures this change because it has no collective\r\nearnestness; it does not mind seeing the power it gave used in a manner\r\nthat it could not have foreseen. But a self-formed constituency of\r\neager opinions, a missionary constituency, so to speak, would object;\r\nit would think it its bounden duty to object; and the crafty\r\nmanipulators, though they said nothing, in silence would object still\r\nmore. The two together would enjoin annual elections, and would rule\r\ntheir members unflinchingly.\r\n\r\nThe voluntary plan, therefore, when tried in this easy form is\r\ninconsistent with the extrinsic independence as well as with the\r\ninherent moderation of a Parliament--two of the conditions which, as we\r\nhave seen, are essential to the bare possibility of Parliamentary\r\ngovernment. The same objections, as is inevitable, adhere to that\r\nprinciple under its more complicated forms. It is in vain to pile\r\ndetail on detail when the objection is one of first principle. If the\r\nabove reasoning be sound, compulsory constituencies are necessary,\r\nvoluntary constituencies destructive; the optional transferability of\r\nvotes is not a salutary aid, but a ruinous innovation.\r\n\r\nI have dwelt upon the proposal of Mr. Hare and upon the\r\nultra-democratic proposal, not only because of the high intellectual\r\ninterest of the former and the possible practical interest of the\r\nlatter, but because they tend to bring into relief two at least of the\r\nnecessary conditions of Parliamentary government. But besides these\r\nnecessary qualities which are needful before a Parliamentary government\r\ncan work at all, there are some additional prerequisites before it can\r\nwork well. That a House of Commons may work well it must perform, as we\r\nsaw, five functions well: it must elect a Ministry well, legislate\r\nwell, teach the nation well, express the nation's will well, bring\r\nmatters to the nation's attention well.\r\n\r\nThe discussion has a difficulty of its own. What is meant by \"well\"?\r\nWho is to judge? Is it to be some panel of philosophers, some fancied\r\nposterity, or some other outside authority? I answer, no philosophy, no\r\nposterity, no external authority, but the English nation here and now.\r\n\r\nFree government is self-government--a government of the people by the\r\npeople. The best government of this sort is that which the people think\r\nbest. An imposed government, a government like that of the English in\r\nIndia, may very possibly be better; it may represent the views of a\r\nhigher race than the governed race; but it is not therefore a free\r\ngovernment. A free government is that which the people subject to it\r\nvoluntarily choose. In a casual collection of loose people the only\r\npossible free government is a democratic government. Where no one\r\nknows, or cares for, or respects any one else all must rank equal; no\r\none's opinion can be more potent than that of another. But, as has been\r\nexplained, a deferential nation has a structure of its own. Certain\r\npersons are by common consent agreed to be wiser than others, and their\r\nopinion is, by consent, to rank for much more than its numerical value.\r\nWe may in these happy nations weigh votes as well as count them, though\r\nin less favoured countries we can count only. But in free nations, the\r\nvotes so weighed or so counted must decide. A perfect free government\r\nis one which decides perfectly according to those votes; an imperfect,\r\none which so decides imperfectly; a bad, one which does not so decide\r\nat all. Public opinion is the test of this polity; the best opinion\r\nwhich with its existing habits of deference, the nation will accept: if\r\nthe free government goes by that opinion, it is a good government of\r\nits species; if it contravenes that opinion, it is a bad one.\r\n\r\nTried by this rule the House of Commons does its appointing business\r\nwell. It chooses rulers as we wish rulers to be chosen. If it did not,\r\nin a speaking and writing age we should soon know. I have heard a great\r\nLiberal statesman say, \"The time was coming when we must advertise for\r\na grievance\".[6] What a good grievance it would be were the Ministry\r\nappointed and retained by the Parliament a Ministry detested by the\r\nnation. An anti-present-government league would be instantly created,\r\nand it would be more instantly powerful and more instantly successful\r\nthan the Anti-Corn-Law League.\r\n\r\n\r\n[6] This was said in 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has, indeed, been objected that the choosing business of Parliament\r\nis done ill, because it does not choose strong Governments. And it is\r\ncertain that when public opinion does not definitely decide upon a\r\nmarked policy, and when in consequence parties in the Parliament are\r\nnearly even, individual cupidity and changeability may make Parliament\r\nchange its appointees too often; may induce them never enough to trust\r\nany of them; may make it keep all of them under a suspended sentence of\r\ncoming dismissal. But the experience of Lord Palmerston's second\r\nGovernment proves, I think, that these fears are exaggerated. When the\r\nchoice of a nation is really fixed on a statesman, Parliament will fix\r\nupon him too. The parties in the Parliament of 1859 were as nearly\r\ndivided as in any probable Parliament; a great many Liberals did not\r\nmuch like Lord Palmerston, and they would have gladly co-operated in an\r\nattempt to dethrone him. But the same influence acted on Parliament\r\nwithin which acted on the nation without. The moderate men of both\r\nparties were satisfied that Lord Palmerston's was the best Government,\r\nand they therefore preserved it though it was hated by the immoderate\r\non both sides. We have then found by a critical instance that a\r\ngovernment supported by what I may call \"the common element\"--by the\r\nlike-minded men of unlike parties--will be retained in power, though\r\nparties are even, and though, as Treasury counting reckons, the\r\nmajority is imperceptible. If happily, by its intelligence and\r\nattractiveness, a Cabinet can gain a hold upon the great middle part of\r\nParliament, it will continue to exist notwithstanding the hatching of\r\nsmall plots and the machinations of mean factions.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, I think it indisputable that the selecting task of\r\nParliament is performed as well as public opinion wishes it to be\r\nperformed; and if we want to improve that standard, we must first\r\nimprove the English nation, which imposes that standard. Of the\r\nsubstantial part of its legislative task, the same, too, may, I think,\r\nbe said. The manner of our legislation is indeed detestable, and the\r\nmachinery for settling that manner odious. A committee of the whole\r\nHouse, dealing, or attempting to deal with the elaborate clauses of a\r\nlong bill, is a wretched specimen of severe but misplaced labour. It is\r\nsure to wedge some clause into the Act, such as that which the judge\r\nsaid \"seemed to have fallen by itself, PERHAPS, from heaven, into the\r\nmind of the legislature,\" so little had it to do with anything on\r\neither side or around it. At such times government by a public meeting\r\ndisplays its inherent defects, and is little restrained by its\r\nnecessary checks. But the essence of our legislature may be separated\r\nfrom its accidents. Subject to two considerable defects I think\r\nParliament passes laws as the nation wishes to have them passed.\r\n\r\nThirty years ago this was not so. The nation had outgrown its\r\ninstitutions, and was cramped by them. It was a man in the clothes of a\r\nboy; every limb wanted more room, and every garment to be fresh made.\r\n\"D-mn me,\" said Lord Eldon in the dialect of his age, \"if I had to\r\nbegin life again I would begin as an agitator.\" The shrewd old man saw\r\nthat the best life was that of a miscellaneous objector to the old\r\nworld, though he loved that world, believed in it, could imagine no\r\nother. But he would not say so now. There is no worse trade than\r\nagitation at this time. A man can hardly get an audience if he wishes\r\nto complain of anything. Nowadays, not only does the mind and policy of\r\nParliament (subject to the exceptions before named) possess the common\r\nsort of moderation essential to the possibility of Parliamentary\r\ngovernment, but also that exact gradation, that precise species of\r\nmoderation, most agreeable to the nation at large. Not only does the\r\nnation endure a Parliamentary government, which it would not do if\r\nParliament were immoderate, but it likes Parliamentary government. A\r\nsense of satisfaction permeates the country because most or the country\r\nfeels it has got the precise thing that suits it.\r\n\r\nThe exceptions are two. First. That Parliament leans too much to the\r\nopinions of the landed interest. The Cattle Plague Act is a conspicuous\r\ninstance of this defect. The details of that bill may be good or bad,\r\nand its policy wise or foolish. But the manner in which it was hurried\r\nthrough the House savoured of despotism. The cotton trade or the wine\r\ntrade could not, in their maximum of peril, have obtained such aid in\r\nsuch a manner. The House of Commons would hear of no pause and would\r\nheed no arguments. The greatest number of them feared for their\r\nincomes. The land of England returns many members annually for the\r\ncounties; these members the Constitution gave them. But what is curious\r\nis that the landed interest gives no seats to other classes, but takes\r\nplenty of seats FROM other classes. Half the boroughs in England are\r\nrepresented by considerable landowners, and when rent is in question,\r\nas in the cattle case, they think more of themselves than of those who\r\nsent them. In number the landed gentry in the House far surpass any\r\nother class. They have, too, a more intimate connection with one\r\nanother; they were educated at the same schools; know one another's\r\nfamily name from boyhood; form a society; are the same kind of men;\r\nmarry the same kind of women. The merchants and manufacturers in\r\nParliament are a motley race--one educated here, another there, a third\r\nnot educated at all; some are of the second generation of traders, who\r\nconsider self-made men intruders upon an hereditary place; others are\r\nself-made, and regard the men of inherited wealth, which they did not\r\nmake and do not augment, as beings of neither mind nor place, inferior\r\nto themselves because they have no brains, and inferior to lords\r\nbecause they have no rank. Traders have no bond of union, no habits of\r\nintercourse; their wives, if they care for society, want to see not the\r\nwives of other such men, but \"better people,\" as they say--the wives of\r\nmen certainly with land, and, if Heaven help, with the titles. Men who\r\nstudy the structure of Parliament, not in abstract books, but in the\r\nconcrete London world, wonder not that the landed interest is very\r\npowerful, but that it is not despotic. I believe it would be despotic\r\nif it were clever, or rather if its representatives were so, but it has\r\na fixed device to make them stupid. The counties not only elect\r\nlandowners, which is natural, and perhaps wise, but also elect only\r\nlandowners OF THEIR OWN COUNTY, which is absurd. There is no free trade\r\nin the agricultural mind; each county prohibits the import of able men\r\nfrom other counties. This is why eloquent sceptics--Bolingbroke and\r\nDisraeli--have been so apt to lead the unsceptical Tories. They WILL\r\nhave people with a great piece of land in a particular spot, and of\r\ncourse these people generally cannot speak, and often cannot think. And\r\nso eloquent men who laugh at the party come to lead the party. The\r\nlanded interest has much more influence than it should have; but it\r\nwastes that influence so much that the excess is, except on singular\r\noccurrences (like the cattle plague), of secondary moment.\r\n\r\nIt is almost another side of the same matter to say that the structure\r\nof Parliament gives too little weight to the growing districts of the\r\ncountry and too much to the stationary, In old times the south of\r\nEngland was not only the pleasantest but the greatest part of England.\r\nDevonshire was a great maritime county when the foundations of our\r\nrepresentation were fixed; Somersetshire and Wiltshire great\r\nmanufacturing counties. The harsher climate of the northern counties\r\nwas associated with a ruder, a stern, and a sparser people. The immense\r\npreponderance which our Parliament gave before 1832, and though pruned\r\nand mitigated, still gives to England south of the Trent, then\r\ncorresponded to a real preponderance in wealth and mind. How opposite\r\nthe present contrast is we all know. And the case gets worse every day.\r\nThe nature of modern trade is to give to those who have much and take\r\nfrom those who have little. Manufacture goes where manufacture is,\r\nbecause there and there alone it finds attendant and auxiliary\r\nmanufacture. Every railway takes trade from the little town to the big\r\ntown because it enables the customer to buy in the big town. Year by\r\nyear the North (as we may roughly call the new industrial world) gets\r\nmore important, and the South (as we may call the pleasant remnant of\r\nold time) gets less important. It is a grave objection to our existing\r\nParliamentary constitution that it gives much power to regions of past\r\ngreatness, and refuses equal power to regions of present greatness.\r\n\r\nI think (though it is not a popular notion) that by far the greater\r\npart of the cry for Parliamentary reform is due to this inequality. The\r\ngreat capitalists, Mr. Bright and his friends, believe they are sincere\r\nin asking for more power for the working man, but, in fact, they very\r\nnaturally and very properly want more power for themselves. They cannot\r\nendure--they ought not to endure--that a rich, able manufacturer should\r\nbe a less man than a small stupid squire. The notions of political\r\nequality which Mr. Bright puts forward are as old as political\r\nspeculation, and have been refuted by the first efforts of that\r\nspeculation. But for all that they are likely to last as long as\r\npolitical society, because they are based upon indelible principles in\r\nhuman nature. Edmund Burke called the first East Indians, \"Jacobins to\r\na man,\" because they did not feel their \"present importance equal to\r\ntheir real wealth\". So long as there is an uneasy class, a class which\r\nhas not its just power, it will rashly clutch and blindly believe the\r\nnotion that all men should have the same power.\r\n\r\nI do not consider the exclusion of the working classes from effectual\r\nrepresentation a defect in THIS aspect of our Parliamentary\r\nrepresentation. The working classes contribute almost nothing to our\r\ncorporate public opinion, and therefore, the fact of their want of\r\ninfluence in Parliament does not impair the coincidence of Parliament\r\nwith public opinion. They are left out in the representation, and also\r\nin the thing represented.\r\n\r\nNor do I think the number of persons of aristocratic descent in\r\nParliament impairs the accordance of Parliament with public opinion. No\r\ndoubt the direct descendants and collateral relatives of noble families\r\nsupply members to Parliament in far greater proportion than is\r\nwarranted by the number of such families in comparison with the whole\r\nnation. But I do not believe that these families have the least\r\ncorporate character, or any common opinions, different from others of\r\nthe landed gentry. They have the opinions of the propertied rank in\r\nwhich they were born. The English aristocracy have never been a caste\r\napart, and are not a caste apart now. They would keep up nothing that\r\nother landed gentlemen would not. And if any landed gentlemen are to be\r\nsent to the House of Commons, it is desirable that many should be men\r\nof some rank. As long as we keep up a double set of institutions--one\r\ndignified and intended to impress the many, the other efficient and\r\nintended to govern the many--we should take care that the two match\r\nnicely, and hide where the one begins and where the other ends. This is\r\nin part effected by conceding some subordinate power to the august part\r\nof our polity, but it is equally aided by keeping an aristocratic\r\nelement in the useful part of our polity. In truth, the deferential\r\ninstinct secures both. Aristocracy is a power in the \"constituencies\".\r\nA man who is an honourable or a baronet, or better yet, perhaps, a real\r\nearl, though Irish, is coveted by half the electing bodies; and\r\ncaeteris paribus, a manufacturer's son has no chance with him. The\r\nreality of the deferential feeling in the community is tested by the\r\nactual election of the class deferred to, where there is a large free\r\nchoice betwixt it and others.\r\n\r\nSubject therefore to the two minor, but still not inconsiderable,\r\ndefects I have named, Parliament conforms itself accurately enough,\r\nboth as a chooser of executives and as a legislature, to the formed\r\nopinion of the country. Similarly, and subject to the same exceptions,\r\nit expresses the nation's opinion in words well, when it happens that\r\nwords, not laws, are wanted. On foreign matters, where we cannot\r\nlegislate, whatever the English nation thinks, or thinks it thinks, as\r\nto the critical events of the world, whether in Denmark, in Italy, or\r\nAmerica, and no matter whether it thinks wisely or unwisely, that same\r\nsomething, wise or unwise, will be thoroughly well said in Parliament.\r\nThe lyrical function of Parliament, if I may use such a phrase, is well\r\ndone; it pours out in characteristic words the characteristic heart of\r\nthe nation. And it can do little more useful. Now that free government\r\nis in Europe so rare and in America so distant, the opinion, even the\r\nincomplete, erroneous, rapid opinion of the free English people is\r\ninvaluable. It may be very wrong, but it is sure to be unique; and if\r\nit is right it is sure to contain matter of great magnitude, for it is\r\nonly a first-class matter in distant things which a free people ever\r\nsees or learns. The English people must miss a thousand minutiae that\r\ncontinental bureaucracies know even too well; but if they see a\r\ncardinal truth which those bureaucracies miss, that cardinal truth may\r\ngreatly help the world.\r\n\r\nBut if in these ways, and subject to these exceptions, Parliament by\r\nits policy and its speech well embodies and expresses public opinion, I\r\nown I think it must be conceded that it is not equally successful in\r\nelevating public opinion. The teaching task of Parliament is the task\r\nit does worst. Probably at this moment, it is natural to exaggerate\r\nthis defect. The greatest teacher of all in Parliament, the head-master\r\nof the nation, the great elevator of the country--so far as Parliament\r\nelevates it--must be the Prime Minister: he has an influence, an\r\nauthority, a facility in giving a great tone to discussion, or a mean\r\ntone, which no other man has. Now Lord Palmerston for many years\r\nsteadily applied his mind to giving, not indeed a mean tone, but a\r\nlight tone, to the proceedings of Parliament. One of his greatest\r\nadmirers has since his death told a story of which he scarcely sees, or\r\nseems to see, the full effect. When Lord Palmerston was first made\r\nleader of the House, his jaunty manner was not at all popular, and some\r\npredicted failure. \"No,\" said an old member, \"he will soon educate us\r\nDOWN to his level; the House will soon prefer this Ha! Ha! style to the\r\nwit of Canning and the gravity of Peel.\" I am afraid that we must own\r\nthat the prophecy was accomplished. No Prime Minister, so popular and\r\nso influential, has ever left in the public memory so little noble\r\nteaching. Twenty years hence, when men inquire as to the then fading\r\nmemory of Palmerston, we shall be able to point to no great truth which\r\nhe taught, no great distinct policy which he embodied, no noble words\r\nwhich once fascinated his age, and which, in after years, men would not\r\nwillingly let die. But we shall be able to say \"he had a genial manner,\r\na firm, sound sense; he had a kind of cant of insincerity, but we\r\nalways knew what he meant; he had the brain of a ruler in the clothes\r\nof a man of fashion\". Posterity will hardly understand the words of the\r\naged reminiscent, but we now feel their effect. The House of Commons,\r\nsince it caught its tone from such a statesman, has taught the nation\r\nworse, and elevated it less, than usual.\r\n\r\nI think, however, that a correct observer would decide that in general,\r\nand on principle, the House of Commons does not teach the public as\r\nmuch as it might teach it, or as the public would wish to learn. I do\r\nnot wish very abstract, very philosophical, very hard matters to be\r\nstated in Parliament. The teaching there given must be popular, and to\r\nbe popular it must be concrete, embodied, short. The problem is to know\r\nthe highest truth which the people will bear, and to inculcate and\r\npreach that. Certainly Lord Palmerston did not preach it. He a little\r\ndegraded us by preaching a doctrine just below our own standard--a\r\ndoctrine not enough below us to repel us much, but yet enough below to\r\nharm us by augmenting a worldliness which needed no addition, and by\r\ndiminishing a love of principle and philosophy which did not want\r\ndeduction.\r\n\r\nIn comparison with the debates of any other assembly, it is true the\r\ndebates by the English Parliament are most instructive. The debates in\r\nthe American Congress have little teaching efficacy; it is the\r\ncharacteristic vice of Presidential government to deprive them of that\r\nefficacy; in that government a debate in the legislature has little\r\neffect, for it cannot turn out the executive, and the executive can\r\nveto all it decides. The French Chambers[7] are suitable appendages to\r\nan Empire which desires the power of despotism without its shame; they\r\nprevent the enemies of the Empire being quite correct when they say\r\nthere is no free speech; a few permitted objectors fill the air with\r\neloquence, which every one knows to be often true, and always vain. The\r\ndebates in an English Parliament fill a space in the world which, in\r\nthese auxiliary chambers, is not possible. But I think any one who\r\ncompares the discussions on great questions in the higher part of the\r\npress, with the discussions in Parliament, will feel that there is (of\r\ncourse amid much exaggeration and vagueness) a greater vigour and a\r\nhigher meaning in the writing than in the speech: a vigour which the\r\npublic appreciate--a meaning that they like to hear.\r\n\r\n\r\n[7] This of course relates to the assemblies of the Empire.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Saturday Review said, some years since, that the ability of\r\nParliament was a \"protected ability\": that there was at the door a\r\ndifferential duty of at least 2000 pounds a year. Accordingly the House\r\nof Commons, representing only mind coupled with property, is not equal\r\nin mind to a legislature chosen for mind only, and whether accompanied\r\nby wealth or not. But I do not for a moment wish to see a\r\nrepresentation of pure mind; it would be contrary to the main thesis of\r\nthis essay. I maintain that Parliament ought to embody the public\r\nopinion of the English nation; and, certainly, that opinion is much\r\nmore fixed by its property than by its mind. The \"too clever by half\"\r\npeople who live in \"Bohemia,\" ought to have no more influence in\r\nParliament than they have in England, and they can scarcely have less.\r\nOnly, after every great abatement and deduction, I think the country\r\nwould bear a little more mind; and that there is a profusion of opulent\r\ndulness in Parliament which might a little--though only a little--be\r\npruned away.\r\n\r\nThe only function of Parliament which remains to be considered is the\r\ninforming function, as I just now called it; the function which belongs\r\nto it, or to members of it, to bring before the nation the ideas,\r\ngrievances, and wishes of special classes. This must not be confounded\r\nwith what I have called its teaching function. In life, no doubt, the\r\ntwo run one into another. But so do many things which it is very\r\nimportant in definition to separate. The facts of two things being\r\noften found together is rather a reason for, than an objection to,\r\nseparating them, in idea. Sometimes they are NOT found together, and\r\nthen we may be puzzled if we have not trained ourselves to separate\r\nthem. The teaching function brings true ideas before the nation, and is\r\nthe function of its highest minds. The expressive function brings only\r\nspecial ideas, and is the function of but special minds. Each class has\r\nits ideas, wants, and notions; and certain brains are ingrained with\r\nthem. Such sectarian conceptions are not those by which a determining\r\nnation should regulate its action, nor are orators, mainly animated by\r\nsuch conceptions, safe guides in policy. But those orators should be\r\nheard; those conceptions should be kept in sight. The great maxim of\r\nmodern thought is not only the toleration of everything, but the\r\nexamination of everything. It is by examining very bare, very dull,\r\nvery unpromising things, that modern science has come to be what it is.\r\nThere is a story of a great chemist who said he owed half his fame to\r\nhis habit of examining after his experiments, what was going to be\r\nthrown away: everybody knew the result of the experiment itself, but in\r\nthe refuse matter there were many little facts and unknown changes,\r\nwhich suggested the discoveries of a famous life to a person capable of\r\nlooking for them. So with the special notions of neglected classes.\r\nThey may contain elements of truth which, though small, are the very\r\nelements which we now require, because we already know all the rest.\r\n\r\nThis doctrine was well known to our ancestors. They laboured to give a\r\nCHARACTER to the various constituencies, or to many of them. They\r\nwished that the shipping trade, the wool trade, the linen trade, should\r\neach have their spokesman; that the unsectional Parliament should know\r\nwhat each section in the nation thought before it gave the national\r\ndecision. This is the true reason for admitting the working classes to\r\na share in the representation, at least as far as the composition of\r\nParliament is to be improved by that admission. A great many ideas, a\r\ngreat many feelings have gathered among the town artisans--a peculiar\r\nintellectual life has sprung up among them. They believe that they have\r\ninterests which are misconceived or neglected; that they know something\r\nwhich others do not know; that the thoughts of Parliament are not as\r\ntheir thoughts. They ought to be allowed to try to convince Parliament;\r\ntheir notions ought to be stated as those of other classes are stated;\r\ntheir advocates should be heard as other people's advocates are heard.\r\nBefore the Reform Bill, there was a recognised machinery for that\r\npurpose. The member for Westminster, and other members, were elected by\r\nuniversal suffrage (or what was in substance such); those members did,\r\nin their day, state what were the grievances and ideas--or were thought\r\nto be the grievances and ideas--of the working classes. It was the\r\nsingle, unbending franchise introduced in 1832 that has caused this\r\ndifficulty, as it has others.\r\n\r\nUntil such a change is made the House of Commons will be defective,\r\njust as the House of Lords was defective. It will not LOOK right. As\r\nlong as the Lords do not come to their own House, we may prove on paper\r\nthat it is a good revising chamber, but it will be difficult to make\r\nthe literary argument felt. Just so, as long as a great class,\r\ncongregated in political localities, and known to have political\r\nthoughts and wishes, is without notorious and palpable advocates in\r\nParliament, we may prove on paper that our representation is adequate,\r\nbut the world will not believe it. There is a saying in the eighteenth\r\ncentury, that in politics, \"gross appearances are great realities\". It\r\nis in vain to demonstrate that the working classes have no grievances;\r\nthat the middle classes have done all that is possible for them, and so\r\non with a crowd of arguments which I need not repeat, for the\r\nnewspapers keep them in type, and we can say them by heart. But so long\r\nas the \"gross appearance\" is that there are no evident, incessant\r\nrepresentatives to speak the wants of artisans, the \"great reality\"\r\nwill be a diffused dissatisfaction. Thirty years ago it was vain to\r\nprove that Gatton and Old Sarum were valuable seats, and sent good\r\nmembers. Everybody said, \"Why, there are no people there\". Just so\r\neverybody must say now, \"Our representative system must be imperfect,\r\nfor an immense class has no members to speak for it\". The only answer\r\nto the cry against constituencies WITHOUT inhabitants was to transfer\r\ntheir power to constituencies WITH inhabitants. Just so, the way to\r\nstop the complaint that artisans have no members is to give them\r\nmembers--to create a body of representatives, chosen by artisans,\r\nbelieving, as Mr. Carlyle would say, \"that artisanism is the one thing\r\nneedful\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNO. VI.\r\n\r\nON CHANGES OF MINISTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is one error as to the English Constitution which crops up\r\nperiodically. Circumstances which often, though irregularly, occur\r\nnaturally suggests that error, and as surely as they happen it revives.\r\nThe relation of Parliament, and especially of the House of Commons, to\r\nthe executive Government is the specific peculiarity of our\r\nConstitution, and an event which frequently happens much puzzles some\r\npeople as to it.\r\n\r\nThat event is a change of Ministry. All our administrators go out\r\ntogether. The whole executive Government changes--at least, all the\r\nheads of it change in a body, and at every such change some speculators\r\nare sure to exclaim that such a habit is foolish. They say: \"No doubt\r\nMr. Gladstone and Lord Russell may have been wrong about Reform; no\r\ndoubt Mr. Gladstone may have been cross in the House of Commons; but\r\nwhy should either or both of these events change all the heads of all\r\nour practical departments? What could be more absurd than what happened\r\nin 1858? Lord Palmerston was for once in his life over-buoyant; he gave\r\nrude answers to stupid inquiries; he brought into the Cabinet a\r\nnobleman concerned in an ugly trial about a woman; he, or his Foreign\r\nSecretary, did not answer a French despatch by a despatch, but told our\r\nambassador to reply orally. And because of these trifles, or at any\r\nrate these isolated UNadministrative mistakes, all our administration\r\nhad fresh heads. The Poor Law Board had a new chief, the Home\r\nDepartment a new chief, the Public Works a new chief. Surely this was\r\nabsurd.\" Now, is this objection good or bad? Speaking generally, is it\r\nwise so to change all our rulers?\r\n\r\nThe practice produces three great evils. First, it brings in on a\r\nsudden new persons and untried persons to preside over our policy. A\r\nlittle while ago Lord Cranborne[8] had no more idea that he would now\r\nbe Indian Secretary than that he would be a bill broker. He had never\r\ngiven any attention to Indian affairs; he can get them up, because he\r\nis an able educated man who can get up anything. But they are not \"part\r\nand parcel\" of his mind; not his subjects of familiar reflection, nor\r\nthings of which he thinks by predilection, of which he cannot help\r\nthinking. But because Lord Russell and Mr. Gladstone did not please the\r\nHouse of Commons about Reform, there he is. A perfectly inexperienced\r\nman, so far as Indian affairs go, rules all our Indian Empire. And if\r\nall our heads of offices change together, so very frequently it must\r\nbe. If twenty offices are vacant at once, there are almost never twenty\r\ntried, competent, clever men ready to take them. The difficulty of\r\nmaking up a Government is very much like the difficulty of putting\r\ntogether a Chinese puzzle: the spaces do not suit what you have to put\r\ninto them. And the difficulty of matching a Ministry is more than that\r\nof fitting a puzzle, because the Ministers to be put in can object,\r\nthough the bits of a puzzle cannot. One objector can throw out the\r\ncombination. In 1847 Lord Grey would not join Lord John Russell's\r\nprojected Government if Lord Palmerston was to be Foreign Secretary;\r\nLord Palmerston WOULD be Foreign Secretary, and so the Government was\r\nnot formed. The cases in which a single refusal prevents a Government\r\nare rare, and there must be many concurrent circumstances to make it\r\neffectual. But the cases in which refusals impair or spoil a Government\r\nare very common. It almost never happens that the Ministry-maker can\r\nput into his offices exactly whom he would like; a number of placemen\r\nare always too proud, too eager, or too obstinate to go just where they\r\nshould.\r\n\r\n\r\n[8] Now Lord Salisbury, who, when this was written, was Indian\r\nSecretary.--Note to second edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain, this system not only makes new Ministers ignorant, but keeps\r\npresent Ministers indifferent. A man cannot feel the same interest that\r\nhe might in his work if he knows that by events over which he has no\r\ncontrol, by errors in which he had no share, by metamorphoses of\r\nopinion which belong to a different sequence of phenomena, he may have\r\nto leave that work in the middle, and may very likely never return to\r\nit. The new man put into a fresh office ought to have the best motive\r\nto learn his task thoroughly, but, in fact, in England, he has not at\r\nall the best motive. The last wave of party and politics brought him\r\nthere, the next may take him away. Young and eager men take, even at\r\nthis disadvantage, a keen interest in office work, but most men,\r\nespecially old men, hardly do so. Many a battered Minister may be seen\r\nto think much more of the vicissitudes which make him and unmake him,\r\nthan of any office matter.\r\n\r\nLastly, a sudden change of Ministers may easily cause a mischievous\r\nchange of policy. In many matters of business, perhaps in most, a\r\ncontinuity of mediocrity is better than a hotch-potch of excellences.\r\nFor example, now that progress in the scientific arts is\r\nrevolutionising the instruments of war, rapid changes in our\r\nhead-preparers for land and sea war are most costly and most hurtful. A\r\nsingle competent selector of new inventions would probably in the\r\ncourse of years, after some experience, arrive at something tolerable;\r\nit is in the nature of steady, regular, experimenting ability to\r\ndiminish, if not vanquish, such difficulties. But a quick succession of\r\nchiefs has no similar facility. They do not learn from each other's\r\nexperience;--you might as well expect the new head boy at a public\r\nschool to learn from the experience of the last head boy. The most\r\nvaluable result of many years is a nicely balanced mind instinctively\r\nheedful of various errors; but such a mind is the incommunicable gift\r\nof individual experience, and an outgoing Minister can no more leave it\r\nto his successor, than an elder brother can pass it on to a younger.\r\nThus a desultory and incalculable policy may follow from a rapid change\r\nof Ministers.\r\n\r\nThese are formidable arguments, but four things may, I think, be said\r\nin reply to, or mitigation of them. A little examination will show that\r\nthis change of Ministers is essential to a Parliamentary government;\r\nthat something like it will happen in all elective Governments, and\r\nthat worse happens under Presidential government; that it is not\r\nnecessarily prejudicial to a good administration, but that, on the\r\ncontrary, something like it is a prerequisite of good administration;\r\nthat the evident evils of English administration are not the results of\r\nParliamentary government, but of grave deficiencies in other parts of\r\nour political and social state; that, in a word, they result not from\r\nwhat we have, but from what we have NOT.\r\n\r\nAs to the first point, those who wish to remove the choice of Ministers\r\nfrom Parliament have not adequately considered what a Parliament is. A\r\nParliament is nothing less than a big meeting of more or less idle\r\npeople. In proportion as you give it power it will inquire into\r\neverything, settle everything, meddle in everything. In an ordinary\r\ndespotism, the powers of a despot are limited by his bodily capacity,\r\nand by the calls of pleasure; he is but one man; there are but twelve\r\nhours in his day, and he is not disposed to employ more than a small\r\npart in dull business; he keeps the rest for the court, or the harem,\r\nor for society. He is at the top of the world, and all the pleasures of\r\nthe world are set before him. Mostly there is only a very small part of\r\npolitical business which he cares to understand, and much of it (with\r\nthe shrewd sensual sense belonging to the race) he knows that he will\r\nnever understand. But a Parliament is composed of a great number of men\r\nby no means at the top of the world. When you establish a predominant\r\nParliament, you give over the rule of the country to a despot who has\r\nunlimited time--who has unlimited vanity--who has, or believes he has,\r\nunlimited comprehension, whose pleasure is in action, whose life is\r\nwork. There is no limit to the curiosity of Parliament. Sir Robert Peel\r\nonce suggested that a list should be taken down of the questions asked\r\nof him in a single evening; they touched more or less on fifty\r\nsubjects, and there were a thousand other subjects which by parity of\r\nreason might have been added too. As soon as bore A ends, bore B\r\nbegins. Some inquire from genuine love of knowledge, or from a real\r\nwish to improve what they ask about; others to see their name in the\r\npapers; others to show a watchful constituency that they are alert;\r\nothers to get on and to get a place in the Government; others from an\r\naccumulation of little motives they could not themselves analyse, or\r\nbecause it is their habit to ask things. And a proper reply must be\r\ngiven. It was said that \"Darby Griffith destroyed Lord Palmerston's\r\nfirst Government,\" and undoubtedly the cheerful impertinence with which\r\nin the conceit of victory that Minister answered grave men much hurt\r\nhis Parliamentary power. There is one thing which no one will permit to\r\nbe treated lightly--himself. And so there is one too which a sovereign\r\nassembly will never permit to be lessened or ridiculed--its own power.\r\nThe Minister of the day will have to give an account in Parliament of\r\nall branches of administration, to say why they act when they do, and\r\nwhy they do not when they don't.\r\n\r\nNor is chance inquiry all a public department has most to fear. Fifty\r\nmembers of Parliament may be zealous for a particular policy affecting\r\nthe department, and fifty others for another policy, and between them\r\nthey may divide its action, spoil its favourite aims, and prevent its\r\nconsistently working out either of their own aims. The process is very\r\nsimple. Every department at times looks as if it was in a scrape; some\r\napparent blunder, perhaps some real blunder, catches the public eye. At\r\nonce the antagonist Parliamentary sections, which want to act on the\r\ndepartment, seize the opportunity. They make speeches, they move for\r\ndocuments, they amass statistics. They declare \"that in no other\r\ncountry is such a policy possible as that which the department is\r\npursuing; that it is mediaeval; that it costs money; that it wastes\r\nlife; that America does the contrary; that Prussia does the contrary\".\r\nThe newspapers follow according to their nature. These bits of\r\nadministrative scandal amuse the public. Articles on them are very easy\r\nto write, easy to read, easy to talk about. They please the vanity of\r\nmankind. We think as we read, \"Thank God, _I_ am not as that man; _I_\r\ndid not send green coffee to the Crimea; _I_ did not send patent\r\ncartridge to the common guns, and common cartridge to the breech\r\nloaders. _I_ make money; that miserable public functionary only wastes\r\nmoney\". As for the defence of the department, no one cares for it or\r\nreads it. Naturally at first hearing it does not sound true. The\r\nOpposition have the unrestricted selection of the point of attack, and\r\nthey seldom choose a case in which the department, upon the surface of\r\nthe matter, seems to be right. The case of first impression will always\r\nbe that something shameful has happened; that such and such men did\r\ndie; that this and that gun would not go off; that this or that ship\r\nwill not sail. All the pretty reading is unfavourable, and all the\r\npraise is very dull.\r\n\r\nNothing is more helpless than such a department in Parliament if it has\r\nno authorised official defender. The wasps of the House fasten on it;\r\nhere they perceive is something easy to sting, and safe, for it cannot\r\nsting in return. The small grain of foundation for complaint\r\ngerminates, till it becomes a whole crop. At once the Minister of the\r\nday is appealed to; he is at the head of the administration, and he\r\nmust put the errors right, if such they are. The Opposition leader\r\nsays: \"I put it to the right honourable gentleman, the First Lord of\r\nthe Treasury. He is a man of business. I do not agree with him in his\r\nchoice of ends, but he is an almost perfect master of methods and\r\nmeans. What he wishes to do he does do. Now I appeal to him whether\r\nsuch gratuitous errors, such fatuous incapacity, are to be permitted in\r\nthe public service. Perhaps the right honourable gentleman will grant\r\nme his attention while I show from the very documents of the\r\ndepartments,\" etc., etc. What is the Minister to do? He never heard of\r\nthis matter; he does not care about the matter. Several of the\r\nsupporters of the Government are interested in the opposition to the\r\ndepartment; a grave man, supposed to be wise, mutters, \"This is TOO\r\nbad\". The Secretary of the Treasury tells him, \"The House is uneasy. A\r\ngood many men are shaky. A. B. said yesterday he had been dragged\r\nthrough the dirt four nights following. Indeed I am disposed to think\r\nmyself that the department has been somewhat lax. Perhaps an inquiry,\"\r\netc., etc. And upon that the Prime Minister rises and says: \"That Her\r\nMajesty's Government having given very serious and grave consideration\r\nto this most important subject, are not prepared to say that in so\r\ncomplicated a matter the department has been perfectly exempt from\r\nerror. He does not indeed concur in all the statements which have been\r\nmade; it is obvious that several of the charges advanced are\r\ninconsistent with one another. If A. had really died from eating green\r\ncoffee on the Tuesday, it is plain he could not have suffered from\r\ninsufficient medical attendance on the following Thursday. However, on\r\nso complex a subject, and one so foreign to common experience, he will\r\nnot give a judgment. And if the honourable member would be satisfied\r\nwith having the matter inquired into by a committee of that House, he\r\nwill be prepared to accede to the suggestion.\"\r\n\r\nPossibly the outlying department, distrusting the Ministry, crams a\r\nfriend. But it is happy indeed if it chances on a judicious friend. The\r\npersons most ready to take up that sort of business are benevolent\r\namateurs, very well intentioned, very grave, very respectable, but also\r\nrather dull. Their words are good, but about the joints their arguments\r\nare weak. They speak very well, but while they are speaking, the\r\ndecorum is so great that everybody goes away. Such a man is no match\r\nfor a couple of House of Commons gladiators. They pull what he says to\r\nshreds. They show or say that he is wrong about his facts. Then he\r\nrises in a fuss and must explain: but in his hurry he mistakes, and\r\ncannot find the right paper, and becomes first hot, then confused, next\r\ninaudible, and so sits down. Probably he leaves the House with the\r\nnotion that the defence of the department has broken down, and so the\r\nTimes announces to all the world as soon as it awakes.\r\n\r\nSome thinkers have naturally suggested that the heads of departments\r\nshould as such have the right of speech in the House. But the system\r\nwhen it has been tried has not answered. M. Guizot tells us from his\r\nown experience that such a system is not effectual. A great popular\r\nassembly has a corporate character; it has its own privileges,\r\nprejudices, and notions. And one of these notions is that its own\r\nmembers--the persons it sees every day--whose qualities it knows, whose\r\nminds it can test, are those whom it can most trust. A clerk speaking\r\nfrom without would be an unfamiliar object. He would be an outsider. He\r\nwould speak under suspicion; he would speak without dignity. Very often\r\nhe would speak as a victim. All the bores of the House would be upon\r\nhim. He would be put upon examination. He would have to answer\r\ninterrogatories. He would be put through the figures and\r\ncross-questioned in detail. The whole effect of what he said would be\r\nlost in quaestiunculae and hidden in a controversial detritus.\r\n\r\nAgain, such a person would rarely speak with great ability. He would\r\nspeak as a scribe. His habits must have been formed in the quiet of an\r\noffice: he is used to red tape, placidity, and the respect of\r\nsubordinates. Such a person will hardly ever be able to stand the\r\nhurly-burly of a public assembly. He will lose his head--he will say\r\nwhat he should not. He will get hot and red; he will feel he is a sort\r\nof culprit. After being used to the flattering deference of deferential\r\nsubordinates, he will be pestered by fuss and confounded by invective.\r\nHe will hate the House as naturally as the House does not like him. He\r\nwill be an incompetent speaker addressing a hostile audience.\r\n\r\nAnd what is more, an outside administrator addressing Parliament can\r\nmove Parliament only by the goodness of his arguments. He has no votes\r\nto back them up with. He is sure to be at chronic war with some active\r\nminority of assailants or others. The natural mode in which a\r\ndepartment is improved on great points and new points is by external\r\nsuggestion; the worse foes of a department are the plausible errors\r\nwhich the most visible facts suggest, and which only half visible facts\r\nconfute. Both the good ideas and the bad ideas are sure to find\r\nadvocates first in the press and then in Parliament. Against these a\r\npermanent clerk would have to contend by argument alone. The Minister,\r\nthe head of the Parliamentary government, will not care for him. The\r\nMinister will say in some undress soliloquy, \"These permanent 'fellows'\r\nmust look after themselves. I cannot be bothered. I have only a\r\nmajority of nine, and a very shaky majority, too. I cannot afford to\r\nmake enemies for those whom I did not appoint. They did nothing for me,\r\nand I can do nothing for them.\" And if the permanent clerk come to ask\r\nhis help, he will say in decorous language, \"I am sure that if the\r\ndepartment can evince to the satisfaction of Parliament that its past\r\nmanagement has been such as the public interests require, no one will\r\nbe more gratified than myself. I am not aware if it will be in my power\r\nto attend in my place on Monday; but if I can be so fortunate, I shall\r\nlisten to your official statement with my very best attention.\" And so\r\nthe permanent public servant will be teased by the wits, oppressed by\r\nthe bores, and massacred by the innovators of Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe incessant tyranny of Parliament over the public offices is\r\nprevented and can only be prevented by the appointment of a\r\nParliamentary head, connected by close ties with the present Ministry\r\nand the ruling party in Parliament The Parliamentary head is a\r\nprotecting machine. He and the friends he brings stand between the\r\ndepartment and the busybodies and crotchet-makers of the House and the\r\ncountry. So long as at any moment the policy of an office could be\r\naltered by chance votes in either House of Parliament, there is no\r\nsecurity for any consistency. Our guns and our ships are not, perhaps,\r\nvery good now. But they would be much worse if any thirty or forty\r\nadvocates for this gun or that gun could make a motion in Parliament,\r\nbeat the department, and get their ships or their guns adopted. The\r\n\"Black Breech Ordnance Company\" and the \"Adamantine Ship Company\" would\r\nsoon find representatives in Parliament, if forty or fifty members\r\nwould get the national custom for their rubbish. But this result is now\r\nprevented by the Parliamentary head of the department. As soon as the\r\nOpposition begins the attack, he looks up his means of defence. He\r\nstudies the subject, compiles his arguments, and builds little piles of\r\nstatistics, which he hopes will have some effect. He has his reputation\r\nat stake, and he wishes to show that he is worth his present place, and\r\nfit for future promotion. He is well known, perhaps liked, by the\r\nHouse--at any rate the House attends to him; he is one of the regular\r\nspeakers whom they hear and heed. He is sure to be able to get himself\r\nheard, and he is sure to make the best defence he can. And after he has\r\nsettled his speech he loiters up to the Secretary of the Treasury, and\r\nsays quietly, \"They have got a motion against me on Tuesday, you know.\r\nI hope you will have your men here. A lot of fellows have crotchets,\r\nand though they do not agree a bit with one another, they are all\r\nagainst the department; they will all vote for the inquiry.\" And the\r\nSecretary answers, \"Tuesday, you say; no (looking at a paper), I do not\r\nthink it will come on Tuesday. There is Higgins on Education. He is\r\ngood for a long time. But anyhow it shall be all right.\" And then he\r\nglides about and speaks a word here and a word there, in consequence of\r\nwhich, when the anti-official motion is made, a considerable array of\r\nsteady, grave faces sits behind the Treasury Bench--nay, possibly a\r\nrising man who sits in outlying independence below the gangway rises to\r\ndefend the transaction; the department wins by thirty-three, and the\r\nmanagement of that business pursues its steady way.\r\n\r\nThis contrast is no fancy picture. The experiment of conducting the\r\nadministration of a public department by an independent unsheltered\r\nauthority has often been tried, and always failed. Parliament always\r\npoked at it, till it made it impossible. The most remarkable is that of\r\nthe Poor Law. The administration of that law is not now very good, but\r\nit is not too much to say that almost the whole of its goodness has\r\nbeen preserved by its having an official and party protector in the\r\nHouse of Commons. Without that contrivance we should have drifted back\r\ninto the errors of the old Poor Law, and superadded to them the present\r\nmeanness and incompetence in our large towns. All would have been given\r\nup to local management. Parliament would have interfered with the\r\ncentral board till it made it impotent, and the local authorities would\r\nhave been despotic. The first administration of the new Poor Law was by\r\n\"Commissioners\"--the three kings of Somerset House, as they were\r\ncalled. The system was certainly not tried in untrustworthy hands. At\r\nthe crisis Mr. Chadwick, one of the most active and best administrators\r\nin England, was the secretary and the motive power: the principal\r\nCommissioner was Sir George Lewis, perhaps the best selective\r\nadministrator of our time. But the House of Commons would not let the\r\nCommission alone. For a long time it was defended because the Whigs had\r\nmade the Commission, and felt bound as a party to protect it. The new\r\nlaw started upon a certain intellectual impetus, and till that was\r\nspent its administration was supported in a rickety existence by an\r\nabnormal strength. But afterwards the Commissioners were left to their\r\nintrinsic weakness. There were members for all the localities, but\r\nthere were none for them. There were members for every crotchet and\r\ncorrupt interest, but there were none for them. The rural guardians\r\nwould have liked to eke out wages by rates; the city guardians hated\r\ncontrol, and hated to spend money. The Commission had to be dissolved,\r\nand a Parliamentary head was added; the result is not perfect, but it\r\nis an amazing improvement on what would have happened in the old\r\nsystem. The new system has not worked well because the central\r\nauthority has too little power; but under the previous system the\r\ncentral authority was getting to have, and by this time would have had,\r\nno power at all. And if Sir George Lewis and Mr. Chadwick could not\r\nmaintain an outlying department in the face of Parliament, how unlikely\r\nthat an inferior compound of discretion and activity will ever maintain\r\nit!\r\n\r\nThese reasonings show why a changing Parliamentary head, a head\r\nchanging as the Ministry changes, is a necessity of good Parliamentary\r\ngovernment, and there is happily a natural provision that there will be\r\nsuch heads. Party organisation ensures it. In America, where on account\r\nof the fixedly recurring presidential election, and the perpetual minor\r\nelections, party organisation is much more effectually organised than\r\nanywhere else, the effect on the offices is tremendous. Every office is\r\nfilled anew at every presidential change, at least every change which\r\nbrings in a new party. Not only the greatest posts, as in England, but\r\nthe minor posts change their occupants. The scale of the financial\r\noperations of the Federal government is now so increased that most\r\nlikely in that department, at least, there must in future remain a\r\npermanent element of great efficiency; a revenue of 90,000,000 pounds\r\nsterling cannot be collected and expended with a trifling and changing\r\nstaff. But till now the Americans have tried to get on not only with\r\nchanging heads to a bureaucracy, as the English, but without any stable\r\nbureaucracy at all. They have facilities for trying it which no one\r\nelse has. All Americans can administer, and the number of them really\r\nfit to be in succession lawyers, financiers, or military managers is\r\nwonderful; they need not be as afraid of a change of all their\r\nofficials as European countries must, for the incoming substitutes are\r\nsure to be much better there than here; and they do not fear, as we\r\nEnglish fear, that the outgoing officials will be left destitute in\r\nmiddle life, with no hope for the future and no recompense for the\r\npast, for in America (whatever may be the cause of it) opportunities\r\nare numberless, and a man who is ruined by being \"off the rails\" in\r\nEngland soon there gets on another line. The Americans will probably to\r\nsome extent modify their past system of total administrative\r\ncataclysms, but their very existence in the only competing form of free\r\ngovernment should prepare us for and make us patient with the mild\r\ntransitions of Parliamentary government.\r\n\r\nThese arguments will, I think, seem conclusive to almost every one;\r\nbut, at this moment, many people will meet them thus: they will say,\r\n\"You prove what we do not deny, that this system of periodical change\r\nis a necessary ingredient in Parliamentary government, but you have not\r\nproved what we do deny, that this change is a good thing. Parliamentary\r\ngovernment may have that effect, among others, for anything we care: we\r\nmaintain merely that it is a defect.\" In answer, I think it may be\r\nshown not, indeed, that this precise change is necessary to a\r\npermanently perfect administration, but that some analogous change,\r\nsome change of the same species, is so.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, in England, there is a sort of leaning towards\r\nbureaucracy--at least, among writers and talkers. There is a seizure of\r\npartiality to it. The English people do not easily change their rooted\r\nnotions, but they have many unrooted notions. Any great European event\r\nis sure for a moment to excite a sort of twinge of conversion to\r\nsomething or other. Just now, the triumph of the Prussians--the\r\nbureaucratic people, as is believed, par excellence--has excited a kind\r\nof admiration for bureaucracy, which a few years since we should have\r\nthought impossible. I do not presume to criticise the Prussian\r\nbureaucracy of my own knowledge; it certainly is not a pleasant\r\ninstitution for foreigners to come across, though agreeableness to\r\ntravellers is but of very second-rate importance. But it is quite\r\ncertain that the Prussian bureaucracy, though we, for a moment, half\r\nadmire it at a distance, does not permanently please the most\r\nintelligent and liberal Prussians at home. What are two among the\r\nprincipal aims of the Fortschritt Partei--the party of progress--as Mr.\r\nGrant Duff, the most accurate and philosophical of our describers,\r\ndelineates them?\r\n\r\nFirst, \"a liberal system, conscientiously carried out in all the\r\ndetails of the administration, with a view to avoiding the scandals now\r\nof frequent occurrence, when an obstinate or bigoted official sets at\r\ndefiance the liberal initiations of the Government, trusting to\r\nbackstairs influence\".\r\n\r\nSecond, \"an easy method of bringing to justice guilty officials, who\r\nare at present, as in France, in all conflicts with simple citizens,\r\nlike men armed cap-a-pie fighting with defenceless\". A system against\r\nwhich the most intelligent native liberals bring even with colour of\r\nreason such grave objections, is a dangerous model for foreign\r\nimitation.\r\n\r\nThe defects of bureaucracy are, indeed, well known. It is a form of\r\nGovernment which has been tried often enough in the world, and it is\r\neasy to show what, human nature being what it in the long run is, the\r\ndefects of a bureaucracy must in the long run be.\r\n\r\nIt is an inevitable defect, that bureaucrats will care more for routine\r\nthan for results; or, as Burke put it, \"that they will think the\r\nsubstance of business not to be much more important than the forms of\r\nit\". Their whole education and all the habit of their lives make them\r\ndo so. They are brought young into the particular part of the public\r\nservice to which they are attached; they are occupied for years in\r\nlearning its forms--afterwards, for years too, in applying these forms\r\nto trifling matters. They are, to use the phrase of an old writer, \"but\r\nthe tailors of business; they cut the clothes, but they do not find the\r\nbody\". Men so trained must come to think the routine of business not a\r\nmeans, but an end--to imagine the elaborate machinery of which they\r\nform a part, and from which they derive their dignity, to be a grand\r\nand achieved result, not a working and changeable instrument. But in a\r\nmiscellaneous world, there is now one evil and now another. The very\r\nmeans which best helped you yesterday, may very likely be those which\r\nmost impede you to-morrow--you may want to do a different thing\r\nto-morrow, and all your accumulation of means for yesterday's work is\r\nbut an obstacle to the new work. The Prussian military system is the\r\ntheme of popular wonder now, yet it sixty years pointed the moral\r\nagainst form. We have all heard the saying that \"Frederic the Great\r\nlost the battle of Jena\". It was the system which he had established--a\r\ngood system for his wants and his times--which, blindly adhered to, and\r\ncontinued into a different age, put to strive with new competitors,\r\nbrought his country to ruin. The \"dead and formal\" Prussian system was\r\nthen contrasted with the \"living\" French system--the sudden outcome of\r\nthe new explosive democracy. The system which now exists is the product\r\nof the reaction; and the history of its predecessor is a warning what\r\nits future history may be too. It is not more celebrated for its day\r\nthan Frederic's for his, and principle teaches that a bureaucracy,\r\nelated by sudden success, and marvelling at its own merit, is the most\r\nunimproving and shallow of Governments.\r\n\r\nNot only does a bureaucracy thus tend to under-government, in point of\r\nquality; it tends to over-government, in point of quantity. The trained\r\nofficial hates the rude, untrained public. He thinks that they are\r\nstupid, ignorant, reckless--that they cannot tell their own\r\ninterest--that they should have the leave of the office before they do\r\nanything. Protection is the natural inborn creed of every official\r\nbody; free trade is an extrinsic idea alien to its notions, and hardly\r\nto be assimilated with life; and it is easy to see how an accomplished\r\ncritic, used to a free and active life, could thus describe the\r\nofficial.\r\n\r\n\"Every imaginable and real social interest,\" says Mr. Laing, \"religion,\r\neducation, law, police, every branch of public or private business,\r\npersonal liberty to move from place to place, even from parish to\r\nparish within the same jurisdiction; liberty to engage in any branch of\r\ntrade or industry, on a small or large scale, all the objects, in\r\nshort, in which body, mind, and capital can be employed in civilised\r\nsociety, were gradually laid hold of for the employment and support of\r\nfunctionaries, were centralised in bureaux, were superintended,\r\nlicensed, inspected, reported upon, and interfered with by a host of\r\nofficials scattered over the land, and maintained at the public\r\nexpense, yet with no conceivable utility in their duties. They are not,\r\nhowever, gentlemen at large, enjoying salary without service. They are\r\nunder a semi-military discipline. In Bavaria, for instance, the\r\nsuperior civil functionary can place his inferior functionary under\r\nhouse-arrest, for neglect of duty, or other offence against civil\r\nfunctionary discipline. In Wurtemberg, the functionary cannot marry\r\nwithout leave from his superior. Voltaire says, somewhere, that, 'the\r\nart of government is to make two-thirds of a nation pay all it possibly\r\ncan pay for the benefit of the other third'. This is realised in\r\nGermany by the functionary system. The functionaries are not there for\r\nthe benefit of the people, but the people for the benefit of the\r\nfunctionaries. All this machinery of functionarism, with its numerous\r\nranks and gradations in every district, filled with a staff of clerks\r\nand expectants in every department looking for employment,\r\nappointments, or promotions, was intended to be a new support of the\r\nthrone in the new social state of the Continent; a third class, in\r\nconnection with the people by their various official duties of\r\ninterference in all public or private affairs, yet attached by their\r\ninterests to the kingly power. The Beamptenstand, or functionary class,\r\nwas to be the equivalent to the class of nobility, gentry, capitalists,\r\nand men of larger landed property than the peasant-proprietors, and was\r\nto make up in numbers for the want of individual weight and influence.\r\nIn France, at the expulsion of Louis Philippe, the civil functionaries\r\nwere stated to amount to 807,030 individuals. This civil army was more\r\nthan double of the military. In Germany, this class is necessarily more\r\nnumerous in proportion to the population, the landwehr system imposing\r\nmany more restrictions than the conscription on the free action of the\r\npeople, and requiring more officials to manage it, and the semi-feudal\r\njurisdictions and forms of law requiring much more writing and\r\nintricate forms of procedure before the courts than the Code Napoleon.\"\r\n\r\nA bureaucracy is sure to think that its duty is to augment official\r\npower, official business, or official members, rather than to leave\r\nfree the energies of mankind; it overdoes the quantity of government,\r\nas well as impairs its quality.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, that a skilled bureaucracy--a bureaucracy trained from\r\nearly life to its special avocation--is, though it boasts of an\r\nappearance of science, quite inconsistent with the true principles of\r\nthe art of business. That art has not yet been condensed into precepts,\r\nbut a great many experiments have been made, and a vast floating vapour\r\nof knowledge floats through society. One of the most sure principles\r\nis, that success depends on a due mixture of special and non-special\r\nminds--of minds which attend to the means, and of minds which attend to\r\nthe end. The success of the great joint-stock banks of London--the most\r\nremarkable achievement of recent business--has been an example of the\r\nuse of this mixture. These banks are managed by a board of persons\r\nmostly NOT trained to the business, supplemented by, and annexed to, a\r\nbody of specially trained officers, who have been bred to banking all\r\ntheir lives. These mixed banks have quite beaten the old banks,\r\ncomposed exclusively of pure bankers; it is found that the board of\r\ndirectors has greater and more flexible knowledge--more insight into\r\nthe wants of a commercial community--knows when to lend and when not to\r\nlend, better than the old bankers, who had never looked at life, except\r\nout of the bank windows. Just so the most successful railways in Europe\r\nhave been conducted--not by engineers or traffic managers--but by\r\ncapitalists; by men of a certain business culture, if of no other.\r\nThese capitalists buy and use the services of skilled managers, as the\r\nunlearned attorney buys and uses the services of the skilled barrister,\r\nand manage far better than any of the different sorts of special men\r\nunder them. They combine these different specialities--make it clear\r\nwhere the realm of one ends and that of the other begins, and add to it\r\na wide knowledge of large affairs, which no special man can have, and\r\nwhich is only gained by diversified action. But this utility of leading\r\nminds used to generalise, and acting upon various materials, is\r\nentirely dependent upon their position. They must not be at the\r\nbottom--they must not even be half way up--they must be at the top. A\r\nmerchant's clerk would be a child at a bank counter; but the merchant\r\nhimself could, very likely, give good, clear, and useful advice in a\r\nbank court. The merchant's clerk would be equally at sea in a railway\r\noffice, but the merchant himself could give good advice, very likely,\r\nat a board of directors. The summits (if I may so say) of the various\r\nkinds of business are, like the tops of mountains, much more alike than\r\nthe parts below--the bare principles are much the same; it is only the\r\nrich variegated details of the lower strata that so contrast with one\r\nanother. But it needs travelling to know that the summits ARE the same.\r\nThose who live on one mountain believe that THEIR mountain is wholly\r\nunlike all others.\r\n\r\nThe application of this principle to Parliamentary government is very\r\nplain; it shows at once that the intrusion from without upon an office\r\nof an exterior head of the office, is not an evil, but that, on the\r\ncontrary, it is essential to the perfection of that office. If it is\r\nleft to itself, the office will become technical, self-absorbed,\r\nself-multiplying. It will be likely to overlook the end in the means;\r\nit will fail from narrowness of mind; it will be eager in seeming to\r\ndo; it will be idle in real doing. An extrinsic chief is the fit\r\ncorrector of such errors. He can say to the permanent chief, skilled in\r\nthe forms and pompous with the memories of his office, \"Will you, Sir,\r\nexplain to me how this regulation conduces to the end in view?\r\nAccording to the natural view of things, the applicant should state the\r\nwhole of his wishes to one clerk on one paper; you make him say it to\r\nfive clerks on five papers.\" Or, again, \"Does it not appear to you,\r\nSir, that the reason of this formality is extinct? When we were\r\nbuilding wood ships, it was quite right to have such precautions\r\nagainst fire; but now that we are building iron ships,\" etc., etc. If a\r\njunior clerk asked these questions, he would be \"pooh-poohed!\" It is\r\nonly the head of an office that can get them answered. It is he, and he\r\nonly, that brings the rubbish of office to the burning-glass of sense.\r\n\r\nThe immense importance of such a fresh mind is greatest in a country\r\nwhere business changes most. A dead, inactive, agricultural country may\r\nbe governed by an unalterable bureau for years and years, and no harm\r\ncome of it. If a wise man arranged the bureau rightly in the beginning,\r\nit may run rightly a long time. But if the country be a progressive,\r\neager, changing one, soon the bureau will either cramp improvement, or\r\nbe destroyed itself.\r\n\r\nThis conception of the use of a Parliamentary head shows how wrong is\r\nthe obvious notion which regards him as the principal administrator of\r\nhis office. The late Sir George Lewis used to be fond of explaining\r\nthis subject. He had every means of knowing. He was bred in the\r\npermanent civil service. He was a very successful Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer, a very successful Home Secretary, and he died Minister for\r\nWar. He used to say, \"It is not the business of a Cabinet Minister to\r\nwork his department. His business is to see that it is properly worked.\r\nIf he does much, he is probably doing harm. The permanent staff of the\r\noffice can do what he chooses to do much better, or if they cannot,\r\nthey ought to be removed. He is only a bird of passage, and cannot\r\ncompete with those who are in the office all their lives round.\" Sir\r\nGeorge Lewis was a perfect Parliamentary head of an office, so far as\r\nthat head is to be a keen critic and rational corrector of it.\r\n\r\nBut Sir George Lewis was not perfect; he was not even an average good\r\nhead in another respect. The use of a fresh mind applied to the\r\nofficial mind is not only a corrective use, it is also an animating\r\nuse. A public department is very apt to be dead to what is wanting for\r\na great occasion till the occasion is past. The vague public mind will\r\nappreciate some signal duty before the precise, occupied administration\r\nperceives it. The Duke of Newcastle was of this use at least in the\r\nCrimean War. He roused up his department, though when roused it could\r\nnot act. A perfect Parliamentary Minister would be one who should add\r\nthe animating capacity of the Duke of Newcastle to the accumulated\r\nsense, the detective instinct, and the laissez faire habit of Sir\r\nGeorge Lewis.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we take the true view of Parliamentary office we shall\r\nperceive that, fairly, frequent change in the official is an advantage,\r\nnot a mistake. If his function is to bring a representative of outside\r\nsense and outside animation in contact with the inside world, he ought\r\noften to be changed. No man is a perfect representative of outside\r\nsense. \"There is some one,\" says the true French saying, \"who is more\r\nable than Talleyrand, more able than Napoleon. Cest tout le monde.\"\r\nThat many-sided sense finds no microcosm in any single individual.\r\nStill less are the critical function and the animating function of a\r\nParliamentary Minister likely to be perfectly exercised by one and the\r\nsame man. Impelling power and restraining wisdom are as opposite as any\r\ntwo things, and are rarely found together. And even if the natural mind\r\nof the Parliamentary Minister was perfect, long contact with the office\r\nwould destroy his use. Inevitably he would accept the ways of office,\r\nthink its thoughts, live its life. The \"dyer's hand would be subdued to\r\nwhat it works in\". If the function of a Parliamentary Minister is to be\r\nan outsider to his office, we must not choose one who, by habit,\r\nthought, and life, is acclimatised to its ways.\r\n\r\nThere is every reason to expect that a Parliamentary statesman will be\r\na man of quite sufficient intelligence, quite enough various knowledge,\r\nquite enough miscellaneous experience, to represent effectually general\r\nsense in opposition to bureaucratic sense. Most Cabinet Ministers in\r\ncharge of considerable departments are men of superior ability; I have\r\nheard an eminent living statesman of long experience say that in his\r\ntime he only knew one instance to the contrary. And there is the best\r\nprotection that it shall be so. A considerable Cabinet Minister has to\r\ndefend his department in the face of mankind; and though distant\r\nobservers and sharp writers may depreciate it, this is a very difficult\r\nthing. A fool, who has publicly to explain great affairs, who has\r\npublicly to answer detective questions, who has publicly to argue\r\nagainst able and quick opponents, must soon be shown to be a fool. The\r\nvery nature of Parliamentary government answers for the discovery of\r\nsubstantial incompetence.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, none of the competing forms of government have nearly so\r\neffectual a procedure for putting a good untechnical Minister to\r\ncorrect and impel the routine ones. There are but four important forms\r\nof government in the present state of the world--the Parliamentary, the\r\nPresidential, the Hereditary, and the Dictatorial, or Revolutionary. Of\r\nthese I have shown that, as now worked in America, the Presidential\r\nform of government is incompatible with a skilled bureaucracy. If the\r\nwhole official class change when a new party goes out or comes in, a\r\ngood official system is impossible. Even if more officials should be\r\npermanent in America than now, still, vast numbers will always be\r\nchanged. The whole issue is based on a single election--on the choice\r\nof President; by that internecine conflict all else is won or lost. The\r\nmanagers of the contest have that greatest possible facility in using\r\nwhat I may call patronage--bribery. Everybody knows that, as a fact,\r\nthe President can give what places he likes to what persons, and when\r\nhis friends tell A. B., \"If we win, C. D. shall be turned out of Utica\r\nPost-office, and you, A. B., shall have it,\" A. B. believes it, and is\r\njustified in doing so. But no individual member of Parliament can\r\npromise place effectually. HE may not be able to give the places. His\r\nparty may come in, but he will be powerless. In the United States party\r\nintensity is aggravated by concentrating an overwhelming importance on\r\na single contest, and the efficiency of promised offices as a means of\r\ncorruption is augmented, because the victor can give what he likes to\r\nwhom he likes.\r\n\r\nNor is this the only defect of a Presidential government in reference\r\nto the choice of officers. The President has the principal anomaly of a\r\nParliamentary government without having its corrective. At each change\r\nof party the President distributes (as here) the principal offices to\r\nhis principal supporters. But he has an opportunity for singular\r\nfavouritism; the Minister lurks in the office; he need do nothing in\r\npublic; he need not show for years whether he is a fool or wise. The\r\nnation can tell what a Parliamentary member is by the open test of\r\nParliament; but no one, save from actual contact, or by rare position,\r\ncan tell anything certain of a Presidential Minister.\r\n\r\nThe case of a Minister under an hereditary form of government is yet\r\nworse. The hereditary king may be weak; may be under the government of\r\nwomen; may appoint a Minister from childish motives; may remove one\r\nfrom absurd whims. There is no security that an hereditary king will be\r\ncompetent to choose a good chief Minister, and thousands of such kings\r\nhave chosen millions of bad Ministers.\r\n\r\nBy the Dictatorial, or Revolutionary, sort of government, I mean that\r\nvery important sort in which the sovereign--the absolute sovereign--is\r\nselected by insurrection. In theory, one would certainly have hoped\r\nthat by this time such a crude elective machinery would have been\r\nreduced to a secondary part. But, in fact, the greatest nation (or,\r\nperhaps, after the exploits of Bismarck, I should say one of the two\r\ngreatest nations of the Continent) vacillates between the Revolutionary\r\nand the Parliamentary, and now is governed under the Revolutionary\r\nform. France elects its ruler in the streets of Paris. Flatterers may\r\nsuggest that the democratic empire will become hereditary, but close\r\nobservers know that it cannot. The idea of the Government is that the\r\nEmperor represents the people in capacity, in judgment, in instinct.\r\nBut no family through generations can have sufficient, or half\r\nsufficient, mind to do so. The representative despot must be chosen by\r\nfighting, as Napoleon I. and Napoleon III. were chosen. And such a\r\nGovernment is likely, whatever be its other defects, to have a far\r\nbetter and abler administration than any other Government. The head of\r\nthe Government must be a man of the most consummate ability. He cannot\r\nkeep his place, he can hardly keep his life, unless he is. He is sure\r\nto be active, because he knows that his power, and perhaps his head,\r\nmay be lost if he be negligent. The whole frame of his State is\r\nstrained to keep down revolution. The most difficult of all political\r\nproblems is to be solved--the people are to be at once thoroughly\r\nrestrained and thoroughly pleased. The executive must be like a steel\r\nshirt of the Middle Ages--extremely hard and extremely flexible. It\r\nmust give way to attractive novelties which do not hurt; it must resist\r\nsuch as are dangerous; it must maintain old things which are good and\r\nfitting; it must alter such as cramp and give pain. The dictator dare\r\nnot appoint a bad Minister if he would. I admit that such a despot is a\r\nbetter selector of administrators than a Parliament; that he will know\r\nhow to mix fresh minds and used minds better; that he is under a\r\nstronger motive to combine them well; that here is to be seen the best\r\nof all choosers with the keenest motives to choose. But I need not\r\nprove in England that the revolutionary selection of rulers obtains\r\nadministrative efficiency at a price altogether transcending its value;\r\nthat it shocks credit by its catastrophes; that for intervals it does\r\nnot protect property or life; that it maintains an undergrowth of fear\r\nthrough all prosperity; that it may take years to find the true capable\r\ndespot; that the interregna of the incapable are full of all evil; that\r\nthe fit despot may die as soon as found; that the good administration\r\nand all else hang by the thread of his life.\r\n\r\nBut if, with the exception of this terrible Revolutionary government, a\r\nParliamentary government upon principle surpasses all its competitors\r\nin administrative efficiency, why is it that our English Government,\r\nwhich is beyond comparison the best of Parliamentary governments, is\r\nnot celebrated through the world for administrative efficiency? It is\r\nnoted for many things, why is it not noted for that? Why, according to\r\npopular belief is it rather characterised by the very contrary?\r\n\r\nOne great reason of the diffused impression is, that the English\r\nGovernment attempts so much. Our military system is that which is most\r\nattacked. Objectors say we spend much more on our army than the great\r\nmilitary monarchies, and yet with an inferior result. But, then, what\r\nwe attempt is incalculably more difficult. The continental monarchies\r\nhave only to defend compact European territories by the many soldiers\r\nwhom they force to fight; the English try to defend without any\r\ncompulsion--only by such soldiers as they persuade to\r\nserve--territories far surpassing all Europe in magnitude, and situated\r\nall over the habitable globe. Our Horse Guards and War Office may not\r\nbe at all perfect--I believe they are not: but if they had sufficient\r\nrecruits selected by force of law--if they had, as in Prussia, the\r\nabsolute command of each man's time for a few years, and the right to\r\ncall him out afterwards when they liked, we should be much surprised at\r\nthe sudden ease and quickness with which they did things. I have no\r\ndoubt too that any accomplished soldier of the Continent would reject\r\nas impossible what we after a fashion effect. He would not attempt to\r\ndefend a vast scattered empire, with many islands, a long frontier line\r\nin every continent, and a very tempting bit of plunder at the centre,\r\nby mere volunteer recruits, who mostly come from the worst class of the\r\npeople--whom the Great Duke called the \"scum of the earth\"--who come in\r\nuncertain numbers year by year--who by some political accident may not\r\ncome in adequate numbers, or at all, in the year we need them most. Our\r\nWar Office attempts what foreign War Offices (perhaps rightly) would\r\nnot try at; their officers have means of incalculable force denied to\r\nours, though ours is set to harder tasks.\r\n\r\nAgain, the English navy undertakes to defend a line of coast and a set\r\nof dependencies far surpassing those of any continental power. And the\r\nextent of our operations is a singular difficulty just now. It requires\r\nus to keep a large stock of ships and arms. But on the other hand,\r\nthere are most important reasons why we should not keep much. The naval\r\nart and the military art are both in a state of transition; the last\r\ndiscovery of to-day is out of date, and superseded by an antagonistic\r\ndiscovery to-morrow. Any large accumulation of vessels or guns is sure\r\nto contain much that will be useless, unfitting, antediluvian, when it\r\ncomes to be tried. There are two cries against the Admiralty which go\r\non side by side: one says, \"We have not ships enough, no 'relief'\r\nships, no NAVY, to tell the truth\"; the other cry says, \"We have all\r\nthe wrong ships, all the wrong guns, and nothing but the wrong; in\r\ntheir foolish constructive mania the Admiralty have been building when\r\nthey ought to have been waiting; they have heaped a curious museum of\r\nexploded inventions, but they have given us nothing serviceable\". The\r\ntwo cries for opposite policies go on together, and blacken our\r\nexecutive together, though each is a defence of the executive against\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nAgain, the Home Department in England struggles with difficulties of\r\nwhich abroad they have long got rid. We love independent \"local\r\nauthorities,\" little centres of outlying authority. When the\r\nmetropolitan executive most wishes to act, it cannot act effectually\r\nbecause these lesser bodies hesitate, deliberate, or even disobey. But\r\nlocal independence has no necessary connection with Parliamentary\r\ngovernment. The degree of local freedom desirable in a country varies\r\naccording to many circumstances, and a Parliamentary government may\r\nconsist with any degree of it. We certainly ought not to debit\r\nParliamentary government as a general and applicable polity with the\r\nparticular vices of the guardians of the poor in England, though it is\r\nso debited every day.\r\n\r\nAgain, as our administration has in England this peculiar difficulty,\r\nso on the other hand foreign competing administrations have a peculiar\r\nadvantage. Abroad a man under Government is a superior being: he is\r\nhigher than the rest of the world; he is envied by almost all of it.\r\nThis gives the Government the easy pick of the elite of the nation. All\r\nclever people are eager to be under Government, and are hardly to be\r\nsatisfied elsewhere. But in England there is no such superiority, and\r\nthe English have no such feeling. We do not respect a stamp-office\r\nclerk, or an exciseman's assistant. A pursy grocer considers he is much\r\nabove either. Our Government cannot buy for minor clerks the best\r\nability of the nation in the cheap currency of pure honour, and no\r\nGovernment is rich enough to buy very much of it in money. Our\r\nmercantile opportunities allure away the most ambitious minds. The\r\nforeign bureaux are filled with a selection from the ablest men of the\r\nnation, but only a very few of the best men approach the English\r\noffices.\r\n\r\nBut these are neither the only nor even the principal reasons why our\r\npublic administration is not so good as, according to principle and to\r\nthe unimpeded effects of Parliamentary government, it should be. There\r\nare two great causes at work, which in their consequences run out into\r\nmany details, but which in their fundamental nature may be briefly\r\ndescribed. The first of these causes is our ignorance. No polity can\r\nget out of a nation more than there is in the nation. A free government\r\nis essentially a government by persuasion; and as are the people to be\r\npersuaded, and as are the persuaders, so will that government be. On\r\nmany parts of our administration the effect of our extreme ignorance is\r\nat once plain. The foreign policy of England has for many years been,\r\naccording to the judgment now in vogue, inconsequent, fruitless,\r\ncasual; aiming at no distinct pre-imagined end, based on no steadily\r\npre-conceived principle. I have not room to discuss with how much or\r\nhow little abatement this decisive censure should be accepted. However,\r\nI entirely concede that our recent foreign policy has been open to very\r\ngrave and serious blame. But would it not have been a miracle if the\r\nEnglish people, directing their own policy, and being what they are,\r\nhad directed a good policy? Are they not above all nations divided from\r\nthe rest of the world, insular both in situation and in mind, both for\r\ngood and for evil? Are they not out of the current of common European\r\ncauses and affairs? Are they not a race contemptuous of others? Are\r\nthey not a race with no special education or culture as to the modern\r\nworld, and too often despising such culture? Who could expect such a\r\npeople to comprehend the new and strange events of foreign places? So\r\nfar from wondering that the English Parliament has been inefficient in\r\nforeign policy, I think it is wonderful, and another sign of the rude,\r\nvague imagination that is at the bottom of our people, that we have\r\ndone so well as we have.\r\n\r\nAgain, the very conception of the English Constitution, as\r\ndistinguished from a purely Parliamentary Constitution is, that it\r\ncontains \"dignified\" parts--parts, that is, retained, not for intrinsic\r\nuse, but from their imaginative attraction upon an uncultured and rude\r\npopulation. All such elements tend to diminish simple efficiency. They\r\nare like the additional and solely-ornamental wheels introduced into\r\nthe clocks of the Middle Ages, which tell the then age of the moon or\r\nthe supreme constellation; which make little men or birds come out and\r\nin theatrically. All such ornamental work is a source of friction and\r\nerror; it prevents the time being marked accurately; each new wheel is\r\na new source of imperfection. So if authority is given to a person, not\r\non account of his working fitness, but on account of his imaginative\r\nefficiency, he will commonly impair good administration. He may do\r\nsomething better than good work of detail, but will spoil good work of\r\ndetail. The English aristocracy is often of this sort. It has an\r\ninfluence over the people of vast value still, and of infinite value\r\nformerly. But no man would select the cadets of an aristocratic house\r\nas desirable administrators. They have peculiar disadvantages in the\r\nacquisition of business knowledge, business training, and business\r\nhabits, and they have no peculiar advantages.\r\n\r\nOur middle class, too, is very unfit to give us the administrators we\r\nought to have. I cannot now discuss whether all that is said against\r\nour education is well grounded; it is called by an excellent judge\r\n\"pretentious, insufficient, and unsound\". But I will say that it does\r\nnot fit men to be men of business as it ought to fit them. Till lately\r\nthe very simple attainments and habits necessary for a banker's clerk\r\nhad a scarcity-value. The sort of education which fits a man for the\r\nhigher posts of practical life is still very rare; there is not even a\r\ngood agreement as to what it is. Our public officers cannot be as good\r\nas the corresponding officers of some foreign nations till our business\r\neducation is as good as theirs.[9]\r\n\r\n\r\n[9] I am happy to state that this evil is much diminishing. The\r\nimprovement of school education of the middle class in the last\r\ntwenty-five years is marvellous.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut strong as is our ignorance in deteriorating our administration,\r\nanother cause is stronger still. There are but two foreign\r\nadministrations probably better than ours, and both these have had\r\nsomething which we have not had. Theirs in both cases were arranged by\r\na man of genius, after careful forethought, and upon a special design.\r\nNapoleon built upon a clear stage which the French Revolution\r\nbequeathed him. The originality once ascribed to his edifice was indeed\r\nuntrue; Tocqueville and Lavergne have shown that he did but run up a\r\nconspicuous structure in imitation of a latent one before concealed by\r\nthe mediaeval complexities of the old regime. But what we are concerned\r\nwith now is, not Napoleon's originality, but his work. He undoubtedly\r\nsettled the administration of France upon an effective, consistent, and\r\nenduring system; the succeeding governments have but worked the\r\nmechanism they inherited from him. Frederick the Great did the same in\r\nthe new monarchy of Prussia. Both the French system and the Prussian\r\nare new machines, made in civilised times to do their appropriate work.\r\n\r\nThe English offices have never, since they were made, been arranged\r\nwith any reference to one another; or rather they were never made, but\r\ngrew as each could. The sort of free trade which prevailed in public\r\ninstitutions in the English Middle Ages is very curious. Our three\r\ncourts of law--the Queen's Bench, the Common Pleas, and the\r\nExchequer--for the sake of the fees extended an originally contracted\r\nsphere into the entire sphere of litigation. Boni judicis est ampliare\r\njursdictionem, went the old saying; or, in English, \"It is the mark of\r\na good judge to augment the fees of his Court,\" his own income, and the\r\nincome of his subordinates. The central administration, the Treasury,\r\nnever asked any account of the moneys the courts thus received; so long\r\nas it was not asked to pay anything, it was satisfied. Only last year\r\none of the many remnants of this system cropped up, to the wonder of\r\nthe public. A clerk in the Patent Office stole some fees, and naturally\r\nthe men of the nineteenth century thought our principal Finance\r\nMinister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, would be, as in France,\r\nresponsible for it. But the English law was different somehow. The\r\nPatent Office was under the Lord Chancellor, and the Court of Chancery\r\nis one of the multitude of our institutions which owe their existence\r\nto free competition, and so it was the Lord Chancellor's business to\r\nlook after the fees, which of course, as an occupied judge, he could\r\nnot. A certain Act of Parliament did indeed require that the fees of\r\nthe Patent Office should be paid into the \"Exchequer\"; and, again, the\r\n\"Chancellor of the Exchequer\" was thought to be responsible in the\r\nmatter, but only by those who did not know. According to our system the\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer is the enemy of the Exchequer; a whole\r\nseries of enactments try to protect it from him. Until a few months ago\r\nthere was a very lucrative sinecure called the \"Comptrollership of the\r\nExchequer,\" designed to guard the Exchequer against its Chancellor; and\r\nthe last holder, Lord Monteagle, used to say he was the pivot of the\r\nEnglish Constitution. I have not room to explain what he meant, and it\r\nis not needful; what is to the purpose is that, by an inherited series\r\nof historical complexities, a defaulting clerk in an office of no\r\nlitigation was not under natural authority, the Finance Minister, but\r\nunder a far-away judge who had never heard of him.\r\n\r\nThe whole office of the Lord Chancellor is a heap of anomalies. He is a\r\njudge, and it is contrary to obvious principle that any part of\r\nadministration should be entrusted to a judge; it is of very grave\r\nmoment that the administration of justice should be kept clear of any\r\nsinister temptations. Yet the Lord Chancellor, our chief judge, sits in\r\nthe Cabinet, and makes party speeches in the Lords. Lord Lyndhurst was\r\na principal Tory politician, and yet he presided in the O'Connell case.\r\nLord Westbury was in chronic wrangle with the bishops, but he gave\r\njudgment upon \"Essays and Reviews\". In truth, the Lord Chancellor\r\nbecame a Cabinet Minister, because, being near the person of the\r\nsovereign, he was high in court precedence, and not upon a political\r\ntheory wrong or right.\r\n\r\nA friend once told me that an intelligent Italian asked him about the\r\nprincipal English officers, and that he was very puzzled to explain\r\ntheir duties, and especially to explain the relation of their duties to\r\ntheir titles. I do not remember all the cases, but I can recollect that\r\nthe Italian could not comprehend why the First \"Lord of the Treasury\"\r\nhad as a rule nothing to do with the Treasury, or why the \"Woods and\r\nForests\" looked after the sewerage of towns. This conversation was\r\nyears before the cattle plague, but I should like to have heard the\r\nreasons why the Privy Council Office had charge of that malady. Of\r\ncourse one could give an historical reason, but I mean an\r\nadministrative reason a reason which would show, not how it came to\r\nhave the duty, but why in future it should keep it.\r\n\r\nBut the unsystematic and casual arrangement of our public offices is\r\nnot more striking than their difference of arrangement for the one\r\npurpose they have in common. They all, being under the ultimate\r\ndirection of a Parliamentary official, ought to have the best means of\r\nbringing the whole of the higher concerns of the office before that\r\nofficial. When the fresh mind rules, the fresh mind requires to be\r\ninformed. And most business being rather alike, the machinery for\r\nbringing it before the extrinsic chief ought, for the most part, to be\r\nsimilar: at any rate, where it is different, it ought to be different\r\nupon reason; and where it is similar, similar upon reason. Yet there\r\nare almost no two offices which are exactly alike in the defined\r\nrelations of the permanent official to the Parliamentary chief. Let us\r\nsee. The ARMY AND NAVY are the most similar in nature, yet there is in\r\nthe army a permanent outside office, called the Horse Guards, to which\r\nthere is nothing else like. In the navy, there is a curious anomaly--a\r\nBoard of Admiralty, also changing with every Government, which is to\r\ninstruct the First Lord in what he does not know. The relations between\r\nthe First Lord and the Board have not always been easily intelligible,\r\nand those between the War Office and the Horse Guards are in extreme\r\nconfusion. Even now a Parliamentary paper relating to them has just\r\nbeen presented to the House of Commons, which says the fundamental and\r\nruling document cannot be traced beyond the possession of Sir George\r\nLewis, who was Secretary for War three years since; and the confused\r\ndetails are endless, as they must be in a chronic contention of\r\noffices. At the Board of Trade there is only the hypothesis of a Board;\r\nit has long ceased to exist. Even the President and Vice-President do\r\nnot regularly meet for the transaction of affairs. The patent of the\r\nlatter is only to transact business in the absence of the President,\r\nand if the two are not intimate, and the President chooses to act\r\nhimself, the Vice-President sees no papers, and does nothing. At the\r\nTreasury the shadow of a Board exists, but its members have no power,\r\nand are the very officials whom Canning said existed to make a House,\r\nto keep a House, and to cheer the Ministers. The India Office has a\r\nfixed \"Council\"; but the Colonial Office which rules over our other\r\ndependencies and colonies, has not, and never had, the vestige of a\r\ncouncil. Any of these varied Constitutions may be right, but all of\r\nthem can scarcely be right.\r\n\r\nIn truth the real constitution of a permanent office to be ruled by a\r\npermanent chief has been discussed only once in England: that case was\r\na peculiar and anomalous one, and the decision then taken was dubious.\r\nA new India Office, when the East India Company was abolished, had to\r\nbe made. The late Mr. James Wilson, a consummate judge of\r\nadministrative affairs, then maintained that no council ought to be\r\nappointed eo nomine, but that the true Council of a Cabinet Minister\r\nwas a certain number of highly paid, much occupied, responsible\r\nsecretaries, whom the Minister could consult either separately or\r\ntogether, as, and when, he chose. Such secretaries, Mr. Wilson\r\nmaintained, must be able, for no Minister will sacrifice his own\r\nconvenience, and endanger his own reputation by appointing a fool to a\r\npost so near himself, and where he can do much harm. A member of a\r\nBoard may easily be incompetent; if some other members and the chairmen\r\nare able, the addition of one or two stupid men will not be felt; they\r\nwill receive their salaries and do nothing. But a permanent\r\nunder-secretary, charged with a real control over much important\r\nbusiness, must be able, or his superior will be blamed, and there will\r\nbe \"a scrape in Parliament\".\r\n\r\nI cannot here discuss, nor am I competent to discuss, the best mode of\r\ncomposing public offices, and of adjusting them to a Parliamentary\r\nhead. There ought to be on record skilled evidence on the subject\r\nbefore a person without any specific experience can to any purpose\r\nthink about it. But I may observe that the plan which Mr. Wilson\r\nsuggested is that followed in the most successful part of our\r\nadministration, the \"Ways and Means\" part. When the Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer prepares a budget, he requires from the responsible heads of\r\nthe revenue department their estimates of the public revenue upon the\r\npreliminary hypothesis that no change is made, but that last year's\r\ntaxes will continue; if, afterwards, he thinks of making an alteration,\r\nhe requires a report on that too. If he has to renew Exchequer bills,\r\nor operate anyhow in the City, he takes the opinion, oral or written,\r\nof the ablest and most responsible person at the National Debt Office,\r\nand the ablest and most responsible at the Treasury. Mr. Gladstone, by\r\nfar the greatest Chancellor of the Exchequer of this generation, one of\r\nthe very greatest of any generation, has often gone out of his way to\r\nexpress his obligation to these responsible skilled advisers. The more\r\na man knows himself, the more habituated he is to action in general,\r\nthe more sure he is to take and to value responsible counsel emanating\r\nfrom ability and suggested by experience. That this principle brings\r\ngood fruit is certain. We have, by unequivocal admission, the best\r\nbudget in the world. Why should not the rest of our administration be\r\nas good if we did but apply the same method to it?\r\n\r\nI leave this to stand as it was originally written since it does not\r\nprofess to rest on my own knowledge, and only offers a suggestion on\r\ngood authority. Recent experience seems, however, to show that in all\r\ngreat administrative departments there ought to be some one permanent\r\nresponsible head through whom the changing Parliamentary chief always\r\nacts, from whom he learns everything, and to whom he communicates\r\neverything. The daily work of the Exchequer is a trifle compared with\r\nthat of the Admiralty or the Home Office, and therefore a single\r\nprincipal head is not there so necessary. But the preponderance of\r\nevidence at present is that in all offices of very great work some one\r\nsuch head is essential.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNO. VII.\r\n\r\nITS SUPPOSED CHECKS AND BALANCES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a former essay I devoted an elaborate discussion to the comparison\r\nof the royal and unroyal form of Parliamentary government. I showed\r\nthat at the formation of a Ministry, and during the continuance of a\r\nMinistry, a really sagacious monarch might be of rare use. I\r\nascertained that it was a mistake to fancy that at such times a\r\nconstitutional monarch had no rule and no duties. But I proved likewise\r\nthat the temper, the disposition, and the faculties then needful to fit\r\na constitutional monarch for usefulness were very rare, at least as\r\nrare as the faculties of a great absolute monarch, and that a common\r\nman in that place is apt to do at least as much harm as good--perhaps\r\nmore harm. But in that essay I could not discuss fully the functions of\r\na king at the conclusion of an administration, for then the most\r\npeculiar parts of the English Government--the power to dissolve the\r\nHouse of Commons, and the power to create new peers--come into play,\r\nand until the nature of the House of Lords and the nature of the House\r\nof Commons had been explained, I had no premises for an argument as to\r\nthe characteristic action of the king upon them. We have since\r\nconsidered the functions of the two houses, and also the effects of\r\nchanges of Ministry on our administrative system; we are now,\r\ntherefore, in a position to discuss the functions of a king at the end\r\nof an administration. I may seem over formal in this matter, but I am\r\nvery formal on purpose. It appears to me that the functions of our\r\nexecutive in dissolving the Commons and augmenting the Peers are among\r\nthe most important, and the least appreciated, parts of our whole\r\ngovernment, and that hundreds of errors have been made in copying the\r\nEnglish Constitution from not comprehending them.\r\n\r\nHobbes told us long ago, and everybody now understands, that there must\r\nbe a supreme authority, a conclusive power, in every State on every\r\npoint somewhere. The idea of government involves it--when that idea is\r\nproperly understood. But there are two classes of Governments. In one\r\nthe supreme determining power is upon all points the same: in the\r\nother, that ultimate power is different upon different points--now\r\nresides in one part of the Constitution and now in another. The\r\nAmericans thought that they were imitating the English in making their\r\nConstitution upon the last principle--in having one ultimate authority\r\nfor one sort of matter, and another for another sort. But in truth the\r\nEnglish Constitution is the type of the opposite species; it has only\r\none authority for all sorts of matters. To gain a living conception of\r\nthe difference let us see what the Americans did.\r\n\r\nFirst, they altogether retained what, in part, they could not help, the\r\nsovereignty of the separate States. A fundamental article of the\r\nFederal Constitution says that the powers not \"delegated\" to the\r\ncentral Government are \"reserved to the States respectively\". And the\r\nwhole recent history of the Union--perhaps all its history--has been\r\nmore determined by that enactment than by any other single cause. The\r\nsovereignty of the principal matters of State has rested not with the\r\nhighest Government, but with the subordinate Government. The Federal\r\nGovernment could not touch slavery--the \"domestic institution\" which\r\ndivided the Union into two halves, unlike one another in morals,\r\npolitics, and social condition, and at last set them to fight. This\r\ndetermining political fact was not in the jurisdiction of the highest\r\nGovernment in the country, where you might expect its highest wisdom,\r\nnor in the central Government, where you might look for impartiality,\r\nbut in local governments, where petty interests were sure to be\r\nconsidered, and where only inferior abilities were likely to be\r\nemployed. The capital fact was reserved for the minor jurisdictions.\r\nAgain, there has been only one matter comparable to slavery in the\r\nUnited States, and that has been vitally affected by the State\r\nGovernments also. Their ultra-democracy is not a result of Federal\r\nlegislation, but of State legislation. The Federal Constitution deputed\r\none of the main items of its structure to the subordinate governments.\r\nOne of its clauses provides that the suffrages for the Federal House of\r\nRepresentatives shall be, in each State, the same as for the most\r\nnumerous branch of the legislature of that State; and as each State\r\nfixes the suffrage for its own legislatures, the States altogether fix\r\nthe suffrage for the Federal Lower Chamber. By another clause of the\r\nFederal Constitution the States fix the electoral qualification for\r\nvoting at a Presidential election. The primary element in a free\r\ngovernment--the determination how many people shall have a share in\r\nit--in America depends not on the Government but on certain subordinate\r\nlocal, and sometimes, as in the South now, hostile bodies.\r\n\r\nDoubtless the framers of the Constitution had not much choice in the\r\nmatter. The wisest of them were anxious to get as much power for the\r\ncentral Government, and to leave as little to the local governments as\r\nthey could. But a cry was got up that this wisdom would create a\r\ntyranny and impair freedom, and with that help, local jealousy\r\ntriumphed easily. All Federal Government is, in truth, a case in which\r\nwhat I have called the dignified elements of government do not coincide\r\nwith the serviceable elements. At the beginning of every league the\r\nseparate States are the old Governments which attract and keep the love\r\nand loyalty of the people; the Federal Government is a useful thing,\r\nbut new and unattractive. It must concede much to the State\r\nGovernments, for it is indebted to them for motive power: they are the\r\nGovernments which the people voluntarily obey. When the State\r\nGovernments are not thus loved, they vanish as the little Italian and\r\nthe little German potentates vanished; no federation is needed; a\r\nsingle central Government rules all.\r\n\r\nBut the division of the sovereign authority in the American\r\nConstitution is far more complex than this. The part of that authority\r\nleft to the Federal Government is itself divided and subdivided. The\r\ngreatest instance is the most obvious. The Congress rules the law, but\r\nthe President rules the administration. One means of unity the\r\nConstitution does give: the President can veto laws he does not like.\r\nBut when two-thirds of both Houses are unanimous (as has lately\r\nhappened), they can overrule the President and make the laws without\r\nhim; so here there are three separate repositories of the legislative\r\npower in different cases: first, Congress and the President when they\r\nagree; next, the President when he effectually exerts his power; then\r\nthe requisite two-thirds of Congress when they overrule the President.\r\nAnd the President need not be over-active in carrying out a law he does\r\nnot approve of. He may indeed be impeached for gross neglect; but\r\nbetween criminal non-feasance and zealous activity there are infinite\r\ndegrees. Mr. Johnson does not carry out the Freedman's Bureau Bill as\r\nMr. Lincoln, who approved of it, would have carried it out. The\r\nAmerican Constitution has a special contrivance for varying the supreme\r\nlegislative authority in different cases, and dividing the\r\nadministrative authority from it in all cases.\r\n\r\nBut the administrative power itself is not left thus simple and\r\nundivided. One most important part of administration is international\r\npolicy, and the supreme authority here is not in the President, still\r\nless in the House of Representatives, but in the Senate. The President\r\ncan only make treaties, \"provided two-thirds of Senators present\"\r\nconcur. The sovereignty therefore for the greatest international\r\nquestions is in a different part of the State altogether from any\r\ncommon administrative or legislative question. It is put in a place by\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nAgain, the Congress declares war, but they would find it very\r\ndifficult, according to the recent construction of their laws, to\r\ncompel the President to make a peace. The authors of the Constitution\r\ndoubtless intended that Congress should be able to control the American\r\nexecutive as our Parliament controls ours. They placed the granting of\r\nsupplies in the House of Representatives exclusively. But they forgot\r\nto look after \"paper money\"; and now it has been held that the\r\nPresident has power to emit such money without consulting Congress at\r\nall. The first part of the late war was so carried on by Mr. Lincoln;\r\nhe relied not on the grants of Congress, but on the prerogative of\r\nemission. It sounds a joke, but it is true nevertheless, that this\r\npower to issue greenbacks is decided to belong to the President as\r\ncommander-in-chief of the army; it is part of what was called the \"war\r\npower\". In truth money was wanted in the late war, and the\r\nadministration got it in the readiest way; and the nation, glad not to\r\nbe more taxed, wholly approved of it. But the fact remains that the\r\nPresident has now, by precedent and decision, a mighty power to\r\ncontinue a war without the consent of Congress, and perhaps against its\r\nwish. Against the united will of the American PEOPLE a President would\r\nof course be impotent; such is the genius of the place and nation that\r\nhe would never think of it. But when the nation was (as of late)\r\ndivided into two parties, one cleaving to the President, the other to\r\nthe Congress, the now unquestionable power of the President to issue\r\npaper-money may give him the power to continue the war though\r\nParliament (as we should speak) may enjoin the war to cease.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, the whole region of the very highest questions is withdrawn\r\nfrom the ordinary authorities of the State, and reserved for special\r\nauthorities. The \"Constitution\" cannot be altered by any authorities\r\nwithin the Constitution, but only by authorities without it. Every\r\nalteration of it, however urgent or however trifling, must be\r\nsanctioned by a complicated proportion of States or legislatures. The\r\nconsequence is that the most obvious evils cannot be quickly remedied;\r\nthat the most absurd fictions must be framed to evade the plain sense\r\nof mischievous clauses; that a clumsy working and curious technicality\r\nmark the politics of a rough-and-ready people. The practical arguments\r\nand the legal disquisitions in America are often like those of trustees\r\ncarrying out a misdrawn will--the sense of what they mean is good, but\r\nit can never be worked out fully or defended simply, so hampered is it\r\nby the old words of an old testament.\r\n\r\nThese instances (and others might be added) prove, as history proves\r\ntoo, what was the principal thought of the American\r\nConstitution-makers. They shrank from placing sovereign power anywhere.\r\nThey feared that it would generate tyranny; George III. had been a\r\ntyrant to them, and come what might, they would not make a George III.\r\nAccredited theories said that the English Constitution divided the\r\nsovereign authority, and in imitation the Americans split up theirs.\r\n\r\nThe result is seen now. At the critical moment of their history there\r\nis no ready, deciding power. The South, after a great rebellion, lies\r\nat the feet of its conquerors: its conquerors have to settle what to do\r\nwith it.[10] They must decide the conditions upon which the\r\nSecessionists shall again become fellow citizens, shall again vote,\r\nagain be represented, again perhaps govern. The most difficult of\r\nproblems is how to change late foes into free friends. The safety of\r\ntheir great public debt, and with that debt their future credit and\r\ntheir whole power in future wars, may depend on their not giving too\r\nmuch power to those who must see in the debt the cost of their own\r\nsubjugation, and who must have an inclination towards the repudiation\r\nof it, now that their own debt--the cost of their defence--has been\r\nrepudiated. A race, too, formerly enslaved, is now at the mercy of men\r\nwho hate and despise it, and those who set it free are bound to give it\r\na fair chance for new life. The slave was formerly protected by his\r\nchains; he was an article of value; but now he belongs to himself, no\r\none but himself has an interest in his life; and he is at the mercy of\r\nthe \"mean whites,\" whose labour he depreciates, and who regard him with\r\na loathing hatred. The greatest moral duty ever set before a\r\nGovernment, and the most fearful political problem ever set before a\r\nGovernment, are now set before the American. But there is no decision,\r\nand no possibility of a decision. The President wants one course, and\r\nhas power to prevent any other; the Congress wants another course, and\r\nhas power to prevent any other. The splitting of sovereignty into many\r\nparts amounts to there being no sovereign.\r\n\r\n\r\n[10] This was written just after the close of the Civil War, but I do\r\nnot know that the great problem stated in it has as yet been adequately\r\nsolved.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Americans of 1787 thought they were copying the English\r\nConstitution, but they were contriving a contrast to it. Just as the\r\nAmerican is the type of composite Governments, in which the supreme\r\npower is divided between many bodies and functionaries, so the English\r\nis the type of SIMPLE Constitutions, in which the ultimate power upon\r\nall questions is in the hands of the same persons.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate authority in the English Constitution is a newly-elected\r\nHouse of Commons. No matter whether the question upon which it decides\r\nbe administrative or legislative; no matter whether it concerns high\r\nmatters of the essential Constitution or small matters of daily detail;\r\nno matter whether it be a question of making a war or continuing a war;\r\nno matter whether it be the imposing a tax or the issuing a paper\r\ncurrency; no matter whether it be a question relating to India, or\r\nIreland, or London--a new House of Commons can despotically and finally\r\nresolve.\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons may, as was explained, assent in minor matters to\r\nthe revision of the House of Lords, and submit in matters about which\r\nit cares little to the suspensive veto of the House of Lords; but when\r\nsure of the popular assent, and when freshly elected, it is absolute,\r\nit can rule as it likes and decide as it likes. And it can take the\r\nbest security that it does not decide in vain. It can ensure that its\r\ndecrees shall be executed, for it, and it alone, appoints the\r\nexecutive; it can inflict the most severe of all penalties on neglect,\r\nfor it can remove the executive. It can choose, to effect its wishes,\r\nthose who wish the same; and so its will is sure to be done. A\r\nstipulated majority of both Houses of the American Congress can\r\noverrule by stated enactment their executive; but the popular branch of\r\nour legislature can make and unmake ours.\r\n\r\nThe English Constitution, in a word, is framed on the principle of\r\nchoosing a single sovereign authority, and making it good; the\r\nAmerican, upon the principle of having many sovereign authorities, and\r\nhoping that their multitude may atone for their inferiority. The\r\nAmericans now extol their institutions, and so defraud themselves of\r\ntheir due praise. But if they had not a genius for politics; if they\r\nhad not a moderation in action singularly curious where superficial\r\nspeech is so violent; if they had not a regard for law, such as no\r\ngreat people have yet evinced, and infinitely surpassing ours,--the\r\nmultiplicity of authorities in the American Constitution would long ago\r\nhave brought it to a bad end. Sensible shareholders, I have heard a\r\nshrewd attorney say, can work ANY deed of settlement; and so the men of\r\nMassachusetts could, I believe, work ANY Constitution.[11] But\r\npolitical philosophy must analyse political history; it must\r\ndistinguish what is due to the excellence of the people, and what to\r\nthe excellence of the laws; it must carefully calculate the exact\r\neffect of each part of the Constitution, though thus it may destroy\r\nmany an idol of the multitude, and detect the secret of utility where\r\nbut few imagined it to lie.\r\n\r\n\r\n[11] Of course I am not speaking here of the South and South-East, as\r\nthey now are. How any free government is to exist in societies where so\r\nmany bad elements are so much perturbed, I cannot imagine.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow important singleness and unity are in political action no one, I\r\nimagine, can doubt. We may distinguish and define its parts; but policy\r\nis a unit and a whole. It acts by laws--by administrators; it requires\r\nnow one, now the other; unless it can easily move both it will be\r\nimpeded soon; unless it has an absolute command of both its work will\r\nbe imperfect. The interlaced character of human affairs requires a\r\nsingle determining energy; a distinct force for each artificial\r\ncompartment will make but a motley patchwork, if it live long enough to\r\nmake anything. The excellence of the British Constitution is that it\r\nhas achieved this unity; that in it the sovereign power is single,\r\npossible, and good.\r\n\r\nThe success is primarily due to the peculiar provision of the English\r\nConstitution, which places the choice of the executive in the \"people's\r\nHouse\"; but it could not have been thoroughly achieved except for two\r\nparts, which I venture to call the \"safety-valve\" of the Constitution,\r\nand the \"regulator\".\r\n\r\nThe safety-valve is the peculiar provision of the Constitution, of\r\nwhich I spoke at great length in my essay on the House of Lords. The\r\nhead of the executive can overcome the resistance of the second chamber\r\nby choosing new members of that chamber; if he do not find a majority,\r\nhe can make a majority. This is a safety-valve of the truest kind. It\r\nenables the popular will--the will of which the executive is the\r\nexponent, the will of which it is the appointee--to carry out within\r\nthe Constitution desires and conceptions which one branch of the\r\nConstitution dislikes and resists. It lets forth a dangerous\r\naccumulation of inhibited power, which might sweep this Constitution\r\nbefore it, as like accumulations have often swept away like\r\nConstitutions.\r\n\r\nThe regulator, as I venture to call it, of our single sovereignty is\r\nthe power of dissolving the otherwise sovereign chamber confided to the\r\nchief executive. The defects of the popular branch of a legislature as\r\na sovereign have been expounded at length in a previous essay. Briefly,\r\nthey may be summed up in three accusations.\r\n\r\nFirst. Caprice is the commonest and most formidable vice of a choosing\r\nchamber. Wherever in our colonies Parliamentary government is\r\nunsuccessful, or is alleged to be unsuccessful, this is the vice which\r\nfirst impairs it. The assembly cannot be induced to maintain any\r\nadministration; it shifts its selection now from one Minister to\r\nanother Minister, and in consequence there is no government at all.\r\n\r\nSecondly. The very remedy for such caprice entails another evil. The\r\nonly mode by which a cohesive majority and a lasting administration can\r\nbe upheld in a Parliamentary government, is party organisation; but\r\nthat organisation itself tends to aggravate party violence and party\r\nanimosity. It is, in substance, subjecting the whole nation to the rule\r\nof a section of the nation, selected because of its speciality.\r\nParliamentary government is, in its essence, a sectarian government,\r\nand is possible only when sects are cohesive.\r\n\r\nThirdly. A Parliament, like every other sort of sovereign, has peculiar\r\nfeelings, peculiar prejudices, peculiar interests; and it may pursue\r\nthese in opposition to the desires, and even in opposition to the\r\nwell-being of the nation. It has its selfishness as well as its caprice\r\nand its parties.\r\n\r\nThe mode in which the regulating wheel of our Constitution produces its\r\neffect is plain. It does not impair the authority of Parliament as a\r\nspecies, but it impairs the power of the individual Parliament. It\r\nenables a particular person outside Parliament to say, \"You Members of\r\nParliament are not doing your duty. You are gratifying caprice at the\r\ncost of the nation. You are indulging party spirit at the cost of the\r\nnation. You are helping yourself at the cost of the nation. I will see\r\nwhether the nation approves what you are doing or not; I will appeal\r\nfrom Parliament No. 1 to Parliament No. 2.\"\r\n\r\nBy far the best way to appreciate this peculiar provision of our\r\nConstitution is to trace it in action--to see, as we saw before of the\r\nother powers of English royalty, how far it is dependent on the\r\nexistence of an hereditary king, and how far it can be exercised by a\r\nPremier whom Parliament elects. When we examine the nature of the\r\nparticular person required to exercise the power, a vivid idea of that\r\npower is itself brought home to us.\r\n\r\nFirst. As to the caprice of Parliament in the choice of a Premier, who\r\nis the best person to check it? Clearly the Premier himself. He is the\r\nperson most interested in maintaining his administration, and therefore\r\nthe most likely person to use efficiently and dexterously the power by\r\nwhich it is to be maintained. The intervention of an extrinsic king\r\noccasions a difficulty. A capricious Parliament may always hope that\r\nhis caprice may coincide with theirs. In the days when George III.\r\nassailed his Governments, the Premier was habitually deprived of his\r\ndue authority. Intrigues were encouraged because it was always dubious\r\nwhether the king-hated Minister would be permitted to appeal from the\r\nintriguers, and always a chance that the conspiring monarch might\r\nappoint one of the conspirators to be Premier in his room. The caprice\r\nof Parliament is better checked when the faculty of dissolution is\r\nentrusted to its appointee, than when it is set apart in an outlying\r\nand an alien authority.\r\n\r\nBut, on the contrary, the party zeal and the self-seeking of Parliament\r\nare best checked by an authority which has no connection with\r\nParliament or dependence upon it--supposing that such authority is\r\nmorally and intellectually equal to the performance of the entrusted\r\nfunction. The Prime Minister obviously being the nominee of a party\r\nmajority is likely to share its feeling, and is sure to be obliged to\r\nsay that he shares it. The actual contact with affairs is indeed likely\r\nto purify him from many prejudices, to tame him of many fanaticisms, to\r\nbeat out of him many errors. The present Conservative Government\r\ncontains more than one member who regards his party as intellectually\r\nbenighted; who either never speaks their peculiar dialect, or who\r\nspeaks it condescendingly, and with an \"aside\"; who respects their\r\naccumulated prejudices as the \"potential energies\" on which he\r\nsubsists, but who despises them while he lives by them. Years ago Mr.\r\nDisraeli called Sir Robert Peel's Ministry--the last Conservative\r\nMinistry that had real power--\"an organised hypocrisy,\" so much did the\r\nideas of its \"head\" differ from the sensations of its \"tail\". Probably\r\nhe now comprehends--if he did not always--that the air of Downing\r\nStreet brings certain ideas to those who live there, and that the hard,\r\ncompact prejudices of opposition are soon melted and mitigated in the\r\ngreat gulf stream of affairs. Lord Palmerston, too, was a typical\r\nexample of a leader lulling, rather than arousing, assuaging rather\r\nthan acerbating the minds of his followers. But though the composing\r\neffect of close difficulties will commonly make a Premier cease to be\r\nan immoderate partisan, yet a partisan to some extent he must be, and a\r\nviolent one he may be; and in that case he is not a good person to\r\ncheck the party. When the leading sect (so to speak) in Parliament is\r\ndoing what the nation do not like, an instant appeal ought to be\r\nregistered and Parliament ought to be dissolved. But a zealot of a\r\nPremier will not appeal; he will follow his formulae; he will believe\r\nhe is doing good service when, perhaps, he is but pushing to unpopular\r\nconsequences, the narrow maxims of an inchoate theory. At such a minute\r\na constitutional king--such as Leopold the First was, and as Prince\r\nAlbert might have been--is invaluable; he can and will prevent\r\nParliament from hurting the nation.\r\n\r\nAgain, too, on the selfishness of Parliament an extrinsic check is\r\nclearly more efficient than an intrinsic. A Premier who is made by\r\nParliament may share the bad impulses of those who chose him; or, at\r\nany rate, he may have made \"capital\" out of them--he may have seemed to\r\nshare them. The self-interests, the jobbing propensities of the\r\nassembly are sure indeed to be of very secondary interest to him. What\r\nhe will care most for is the permanence, is the interest--whether\r\ncorrupt or uncorrupt--of his own Ministry. He will be disinclined to\r\nanything coarsely unpopular. In the order of nature, a new assembly\r\nmust come before long, and he will be indisposed to shock the feelings\r\nof the electors from whom that assembly must emanate. But though the\r\ninterest of the Minister is inconsistent with appalling jobbery, he\r\nwill be inclined to mitigated jobbery. He will temporise; he will try\r\nto give a seemly dress to unseemly matters: to do as much harm as will\r\ncontent the assembly, and yet not so much harm as will offend the\r\nnation. He will not shrink from becoming a particeps criminis; he will\r\nbut endeavour to dilute the crime. The intervention of an extrinsic,\r\nimpartial, and capable authority--if such can be found--will\r\nundoubtedly restrain the covetousness as well as the factiousness of a\r\nchoosing assembly.\r\n\r\nBut can such a head be found? In one case I think it has been found.\r\nOur colonial governors are precisely Dei ex machina. They are always\r\nintelligent, for they have to live by a different trade; they are\r\nnearly sure to be impartial, for they come from the ends of the earth;\r\nthey are sure not to participate in the selfish desires of any colonial\r\nclass or body, for long before those desires can have attained fruition\r\nthey will have passed to the other side of the world, be busy with\r\nother faces and other minds, be almost out of hearing what happens in a\r\nregion they have half forgotten. A colonial governor is a\r\nsuper-Parliamentary authority, animated by a wisdom which is probably\r\nin quantity considerable, and is different from that of the local\r\nParliament, even if not above it. But even in this case the advantage\r\nof this extrinsic authority is purchased at a heavy price--a price\r\nwhich must not be made light of, because it is often worth paying. A\r\ncolonial governor is a ruler who has no permanent interest in the\r\ncolony he governs; who perhaps had to look for it in the map when he\r\nwas sent thither; who takes years before he really understands its\r\nparties and its controversies; who, though without prejudice himself,\r\nis apt to be a slave to the prejudices of local people near him; who\r\ninevitably, and almost laudably, governs not in the interest of the\r\ncolony, which he may mistake, but in his own interest, which he sees\r\nand is sure of. The first desire of a colonial governor is not to get\r\ninto a \"scrape,\" not to do anything which may give trouble to his\r\nsuperiors--the Colonial Office--at home, which may cause an untimely\r\nand dubious recall, which may hurt his after career. He is sure to\r\nleave upon the colony the feeling that they have a ruler who only half\r\nknows them, and does not so much as half care for them. We hardly\r\nappreciate this common feeling in our colonies, because WE appoint\r\nTHEIR sovereign; but we should understand it in an instant if, by a\r\npolitical metamorphosis, the choice were turned the other way--if THEY\r\nappointed OUR sovereign. We should then say at once, \"How is it\r\npossible a man from New Zealand can understand England? how is it\r\npossible, that a man longing to get back to the antipodes can care for\r\nEngland? how can we trust one who lives by the fluctuating favour of a\r\ndistant authority? how can we heartily obey one who is but a foreigner\r\nwith the accident of an identical language?\"\r\n\r\nI dwell on the evils which impair the advantage of colonial\r\ngovernorship because that is the most favoured case of\r\nsuper-Parliamentary royalty, and because from looking at it we can\r\nbring freshly home to our minds what the real difficulties of that\r\ninstitution are. We are so familiar with it that we do not understand\r\nit. We are like people who have known a man all their lives, and yet\r\nare quite surprised when he displays some obvious characteristic which\r\ncasual observers have detected at a glance. I have known a man who did\r\nnot know what colour his sister's eyes were, though he had seen her\r\nevery day for twenty years; or rather, he did not know because he had\r\nso seen her: so true is the philosophical maxim that we neglect the\r\nconstant element in our thoughts, though it is probably the most\r\nimportant, and attend almost only to the varying elements--the\r\ndifferentiating elements (as men now speak)--though they are apt to be\r\nless potent. But when we perceive by the roundabout example of a\r\ncolonial governor how difficult the task of a constitutional king is in\r\nthe exercise of the function of dissolving Parliament, we at once see\r\nhow unlikely it is that an hereditary monarch will be possessed of the\r\nrequisite faculties.\r\n\r\nAn hereditary king is but an ordinary person, upon an average, at best;\r\nhe is nearly sure to be badly educated for business; he is very little\r\nlikely to have a taste for business; he is solicited from youth by\r\nevery temptation to pleasure; he probably passed the whole of his youth\r\nin the vicious situation of the heir-apparent, who can do nothing\r\nbecause he has no appointed work, and who will be considered almost to\r\noutstep his function if he undertake optional work. For the most part,\r\na constitutional king is a DAMAGED common man; not forced to business\r\nby necessity as a despot often is, but yet spoiled for business by most\r\nof the temptations which spoil a despot. History, too, seems to show\r\nthat hereditary royal families gather from the repeated influence of\r\ntheir corrupting situation some dark taint in the blood, some\r\ntransmitted and growing poison which hurts their judgments, darkens all\r\ntheir sorrow, and is a cloud on half their pleasure. It has been said,\r\nnot truly, but with a possible approximation to truth, \"That in 1802\r\nevery hereditary monarch was insane\". Is it likely that this sort of\r\nmonarchs will be able to catch the exact moment when, in opposition to\r\nthe wishes of a triumphant Ministry, they ought to dissolve Parliament?\r\nTo do so with efficiency they must be able to perceive that the\r\nParliament is wrong, and that the nation knows it is wrong. Now to know\r\nthat Parliament is wrong, a man must be, if not a great statesman, yet\r\na considerable statesman--a statesman of some sort. He must have great\r\nnatural vigour, for no less will comprehend the hard principles of\r\nnational policy. He must have incessant industry, for no less will keep\r\nhim abreast with the involved detail to which those principles relate,\r\nand the miscellaneous occasions to which they must be applied. A man\r\nmade common by nature, and made worse by life, is not likely to have\r\neither; he is nearly sure not to be BOTH clever and industrious. And a\r\nmonarch in the recesses of a palace, listening to a charmed flattery\r\nunbiassed by the miscellaneous world, who has always been hedged in by\r\nrank, is likely to be but a poor judge of public opinion. He may have\r\nan inborn tact for finding it out; but his life will never teach it\r\nhim, and will probably enfeeble it in him.\r\n\r\nBut there is a still worse case, a case which the life of George\r\nIII.--which is a sort of museum of the defects of a constitutional\r\nking--suggests at once. The Parliament may be wiser than the people,\r\nand yet the king may be of the same mind with the people. During the\r\nlast years of the American war, the Premier, Lord North, upon whom the\r\nfirst responsibility rested, was averse to continuing it, and knew it\r\ncould not succeed. Parliament was much of the same mind; if Lord North\r\nhad been able to come down to Parliament with a peace in his hand,\r\nParliament would probably have rejoiced, and the nation under the\r\nguidance of Parliament, though saddened by its losses, probably would\r\nhave been satisfied. The opinion of that day was more like the American\r\nopinion of the present day than like our present opinion. It was much\r\nslower in its formation than our opinion now, and obeyed much more\r\neasily sudden impulses from the central administration. If Lord North\r\nhad been able to throw the undivided energy and the undistracted\r\nauthority of the executive Government into the excellent work of making\r\na peace and carrying a peace, years of bloodshed might have been\r\nspared, and an entail of enmity cut off that has not yet run out. But\r\nthere was a power behind the Prime Minister; George III. was madly\r\neager to continue the war, and the nation--not seeing how hopeless the\r\nstrife was, not comprehending the lasting antipathy which their\r\nobstinacy was creating--ignorant, dull and helpless--was ready to go on\r\ntoo. Even if Lord North had wished to make peace, and had persuaded\r\nParliament accordingly, all his work would have been useless; a\r\nsuperior power could and would have appealed from a wise and pacific\r\nParliament to a sullen and warlike nation. The check which our\r\nConstitution finds for the special vices of our Parliament was misused\r\nto curb its wisdom.\r\n\r\nThe more we study the nature of Cabinet government, the more we shall\r\nshrink from exposing at a vital instant its delicate machinery to a\r\nblow from a casual, incompetent, and perhaps semi-insane outsider. The\r\npreponderant probability is that on a great occasion the Premier and\r\nParliament will really be wiser than the king. The Premier is sure to\r\nbe able, and is sure to be most anxious to decide well; if he fail to\r\ndecide, he loses his place, though through all blunders the king keeps\r\nhis; the judgment of the man naturally very discerning is sharpened by\r\na heavy penalty, from which the judgment of the man by nature much less\r\nintelligent is exempt. Parliament, too, is for the most part a sound,\r\ncareful and practical body of men. Principle shows that the power of\r\ndismissing a Government with which Parliament is satisfied, and of\r\ndissolving that Parliament upon an appeal to the people, is not a power\r\nwhich a common hereditary monarch will in the long run be able\r\nbeneficially to exercise.\r\n\r\nAccordingly this power has almost, if not quite, dropped out of the\r\nreality of our Constitution. Nothing, perhaps, would more surprise the\r\nEnglish people than if the Queen by a coup d'etat and on a sudden\r\ndestroyed a Ministry firm in the allegiance and secure of a majority in\r\nParliament. That power, indisputably, in theory, belongs to her; but it\r\nhas passed so far away from the minds of men that it would terrify\r\nthem, if she used it, like a volcanic eruption from Primrose Hill. The\r\nlast analogy to it is not one to be coveted as a precedent. In 1835\r\nWilliam IV. dismissed an administration which, though disorganised by\r\nthe loss of its leader in the Commons, was an existing Government, had\r\na Premier in the Lords ready to go on, and a leader in the Commons\r\nwilling to begin. The king fancied that public opinion was leaving the\r\nWhigs and going over to the Tories, and he thought he should accelerate\r\nthe transition by ejecting the former. But the event showed that he\r\nmisjudged. His PERCEPTION indeed was right; the English people were\r\nwavering in their allegiance to the Whigs, who had no leader that\r\ntouched the popular heart, none in whom Liberalism could personify\r\nitself and become a passion--who besides were a body long used to\r\nopposition, and therefore making blunders in office--who were borne to\r\npower by a popular impulse which they only half comprehended, and\r\nperhaps less than half shared. But the king's POLICY was wrong; he\r\nimpeded the reaction instead of aiding it. He forced on a premature\r\nTory Government, which was as unsuccessful as all wise people perceived\r\nthat it must be. The popular distaste to the Whigs was as yet but\r\nincipient, inefficient; and the intervention of the Crown was\r\nadvantageous to them, because it looked inconsistent with the liberties\r\nof the people. And in so far as William IV. was right in detecting an\r\nincipient change of opinion, he did but detect an erroneous change.\r\nWhat was desirable was the prolongation of Liberal rule. The commencing\r\ndissatisfaction did but relate to the personal demerits of the Whig\r\nleaders, and other temporary adjuncts of free principles, and not to\r\nthose principles intrinsically. So that the last precedent for a royal\r\nonslaught on a Ministry ended thus:--in opposing the right principles,\r\nin aiding the wrong principles, in hurting the party it was meant to\r\nhelp. After such a warning, it is likely that our monarchs will pursue\r\nthe policy which a long course of quiet precedent at present\r\ndirects--they will leave a Ministry trusted by Parliament to the\r\njudgment of Parliament.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the dangers arising from a party spirit in Parliament exceeding\r\nthat of the nation, and of a selfishness in Parliament contradicting\r\nthe true interest of the nation, are not great dangers in a country\r\nwhere the mind of the nation is steadily political, and where its\r\ncontrol over its representatives is constant. A steady opposition to a\r\nformed public opinion is hardly possible in our House of Commons, so\r\nincessant is the national attention to politics, and so keen the fear\r\nin the mind of each member that he may lose his valued seat. These\r\ndangers belong to early and scattered communities, where there are no\r\ninteresting political questions, where the distances are great, where\r\nno vigilant opinion passes judgment on Parliamentary excesses, where\r\nfew care to have seats in the chamber, and where many of those few are\r\nfrom their characters and their antecedents better not there than\r\nthere. The one great vice of Parliamentary government in an adult\r\npolitical nation, is the caprice of Parliament in the choice of a\r\nMinistry. A nation can hardly control it here; and it is not good that,\r\nexcept within wide limits, it should control it. The Parliamentary\r\njudgment of the merits or demerits of an administration very generally\r\ndepends on matters which the Parliament, being close at hand,\r\ndistinctly sees, and which the distant nation does not see. But where\r\npersonality enters, capriciousness begins. It is easy to imagine a\r\nHouse of Commons which is discontented with all statesmen, which is\r\ncontented with none, which is made up of little parties, which votes in\r\nsmall knots, which will adhere steadily to no leader, which gives every\r\nleader a chance and a hope. Such Parliaments require the imminent check\r\nof possible dissolution; but that check is (as has been shown) better\r\nin the Premier than in the sovereign; and by the late practice of our\r\nconstitution, its use is yearly ebbing from the sovereign, and yearly\r\ncentring in the Premier. The Queen can hardly now refuse a defeated\r\nMinister the chance of a dissolution, any more than she can dissolve in\r\nthe time of an undefeated one, and without his consent.\r\n\r\nWe shall find the case much the same with the safety-valve, as I have\r\ncalled it, of our Constitution. A good, capable, hereditary monarch\r\nwould exercise it better than a Premier, but a Premier could manage it\r\nwell enough; and a monarch capable of doing better will be born only\r\nonce in a century, whereas monarchs likely to do worse will be born\r\nevery day.\r\n\r\nThere are two modes in which the power of our executive to create\r\nPeers--to nominate, that is, additional members of our upper and\r\nrevising chamber--now acts: one constant, habitual, though not\r\nadequately noticed by the popular mind as it goes on; and the other\r\npossible and terrific, scarcely ever really exercised, but always by\r\nits reserved magic maintaining a great and a restraining influence. The\r\nCrown creates peers, a few year by year, and thus modifies continually\r\nthe characteristic feeling of the House of Lords. I have heard people\r\nsay, who ought to know, that the ENGLISH peerage (the only one upon\r\nwhich unhappily the power of new creation now acts) is now more Whig\r\nthan Tory. Thirty years ago the majority was indisputably the other\r\nway. Owing to very curious circumstances English parties have not\r\nalternated in power, as a good deal of speculation predicts they would,\r\nand a good deal of current language assumes they have. The Whig party\r\nwere in office some seventy years (with very small breaks) from the\r\ndeath of Queen Anne to the coalition between Lord North and Mr. Fox;\r\nthen the Tories (with only such breaks), were in power for nearly fifty\r\nyears, till 1832; and since, the Whig party has always, with very\r\ntrifling intervals, been predominant. Consequently, each\r\ncontinuously-governing party has had the means of modifying the Upper\r\nHouse to suit its views. The profuse Tory creations of half a century\r\nhad made the House of Lords bigotedly Tory before the first Reform Act,\r\nbut it is wonderfully mitigated now. The Irish Peers and Scotch\r\nPeers--being nominated by an almost unaltered constituency, and\r\nrepresenting the feelings of the majority of that constituency only (no\r\nminority having any voice)--present an unchangeable Tory element. But\r\nthe element in which change is permitted has been changed. Whether the\r\nEnglish Peerage be or be not predominantly now Tory, it is certainly\r\nnot Tory after the fashion of the Toryism of 1832. The Whig additions\r\nhave indeed sprung from a class commonly rather adjoining upon Toryism,\r\nthan much inclining to Radicalism. It is not from men of large wealth\r\nthat a very great impetus to organic change should be expected. The\r\nadditions to the Peers have matched nicely enough with the old Peers,\r\nand therefore they have effected more easily a greater and more\r\npermeating modification. The addition of a contrasting mass would have\r\nexcited the old leaven, but the delicate infusion of ingredients\r\nsimilar in genus, though different in species, has modified the new\r\ncompound without irritating the old original.\r\n\r\nThis ordinary and common use of the peer-creating power is always in\r\nthe hands of the Premier, and depends for its characteristic use on\r\nbeing there. He, as the head of the predominant party, is the proper\r\nperson to modify gradually the permanent chamber which, perhaps, was at\r\nstarting hostile to him; and, at any rate, can be best harmonised with\r\nthe public opinion he represents by the additions he makes. Hardly any\r\ncontrived constitution possesses a machinery for modifying its\r\nsecondary house so delicate, so flexible, and so constant. If the power\r\nof creating life peers had been added, the mitigating influence of the\r\nresponsible executive upon the House of Lords would have been as good\r\nas such a thing can be.\r\n\r\nThe catastrophic creation of peers for the purpose of swamping the\r\nUpper House is utterly different. If an able and impartial exterior\r\nking is at hand, this power is best in that king. It is a power only to\r\nbe used on great occasions, when the object is immense, and the party\r\nstrife unmitigated. This is the conclusive, the swaying power of the\r\nmoment, and of course, therefore, it had better be in the hands of a\r\npower both capable and impartial, than of a Premier who must in some\r\ndegree be a partisan. The value of a discreet, calm, wise monarch, if\r\nsuch should happen to be reigning at the acute crisis of a nation's\r\ndestiny, is priceless. He may prevent years of tumult, save bloodshed\r\nand civil war, lay up a store of grateful fame to himself, prevent the\r\naccumulated intestine hatred of each party to its opposite. But the\r\nquestion comes back, Will there be such a monarch just then? What is\r\nthe chance of having him just then? What will be the use of the monarch\r\nwhom the accidents of inheritance, such as we know them to be, must\r\nupon an average bring us just then?\r\n\r\nThe answer to these questions is not satisfactory, if we take it from\r\nthe little experience we have had in this rare matter. There have been\r\nbut two cases at all approaching to a catastrophic creation of\r\npeers--to a creation which would suddenly change the majority of the\r\nLords--in English history. One was in Queen Anne's time. The majority\r\nof peers in Queen Anne's time were Whig, and by profuse and quick\r\ncreations Harley's Ministry changed it to a Tory majority. So great was\r\nthe popular effect, that in the next reign one of the most contested\r\nMinisterial proposals was a proposal to take the power of indefinite\r\npeer creation from the Crown, and to make the number of Lords fixed, as\r\nthat of the Commons is fixed. But the sovereign had little to do with\r\nthe matter. Queen Anne was one of the smallest people ever set in a\r\ngreat place. Swift bitterly and justly said \"she had not a store of\r\namity by her for more than one friend at a time,\" and just then her\r\naffection was concentrated on a waiting-maid. Her waiting-maid told her\r\nto make peers, and she made them. But of large thought and\r\ncomprehensive statesmanship she was as destitute as Mrs. Masham. She\r\nsupported a bad Ministry by the most extreme of measures, and she did\r\nit on caprice. The case of William IV. is still more instructive. He\r\nwas a very conscientious king, but at the same time an exceedingly weak\r\nking. His correspondence with Lord Grey on this subject fills more than\r\nhalf a large volume, or rather his secretary's correspondence, for he\r\nkept a very clever man to write what he thought, or at least what those\r\nabout him thought. It is a strange instance of high-placed weakness and\r\nconscientious vacillation. After endless letters the king consents to\r\nmake a REASONABLE number of peers if required to pass the second\r\nreading of the Reform Bill, but owing to desertion of the \"Waverers\"\r\nfrom the Tories, the second reading is carried without it by nine, and\r\nthen the king refuses to make peers, or at least enough peers when a\r\nvital amendment is carried by Lord Lyndhurst, which would have\r\ndestroyed, and was meant to destroy the Bill. In consequence, there was\r\na tremendous crisis and nearly a revolution. A more striking example of\r\nwell-meaning imbecility is scarcely to be found in history. No one who\r\nreads it carefully will doubt that the discretionary power of making\r\npeers would have been far better in Lord Grey's hands than in the\r\nking's. It was the uncertainty whether the king would exercise it, and\r\nhow far he would exercise it, that mainly animated the opposition. In\r\nfact, you may place power in weak hands at a revolution, but you cannot\r\nkeep it in weak hands. It runs out of them into strong ones. An\r\nordinary hereditary sovereign--a William IV., or a George IV.--is unfit\r\nto exercise the peer-creating power when most wanted. A half-insane\r\nking, like George III., would be worse. He might use it by\r\nunaccountable impulse when not required, and refuse to use it out of\r\nsullen madness when required.\r\n\r\nThe existence of a fancied check on the Premier is in truth an evil,\r\nbecause it prevents the enforcement of a real check. It would be easy\r\nto provide by law that an extraordinary number of peers--say more than\r\nten annually--should not be created except on a vote of some large\r\nmajority, suppose three-fourths of the Lower House. This would ensure\r\nthat the Premier should not use the reserve force of the constitution\r\nas if it were an ordinary force; that he should not use it except when\r\nthe whole nation fixedly wished it; that it should be kept for a\r\nrevolution, not expended on administration; and it would ensure that he\r\nshould then have it to use. Queen Anne's case and William IV.'s case\r\nprove that neither object is certainly attained by entrusting this\r\ncritical and extreme force to the chance idiosyncrasies and habitual\r\nmediocrity of an hereditary sovereign.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked why I argue at such length a question in appearance so\r\nremoved from practice, and in one point of view so irrelevant to my\r\nsubject. No one proposes to remove Queen Victoria; if any one is in a\r\nsafe place on earth, she is in a safe place. In these very essays it\r\nhas been shown that the mass of our people would obey no one else, that\r\nthe reverence she excites is the potential energy--as science now\r\nspeaks--out of which all minor forces are made, and from which lesser\r\nfunctions take their efficiency. But looking not to the present hour,\r\nand this single country, but to the world at large and coming times, no\r\nquestion can be more practical.\r\n\r\nWhat grows upon the world is a certain matter-of-factness. The test of\r\neach century, more than of the century before, is the test of results.\r\nNew countries are arising all over the world where there are no fixed\r\nsources of reverence; which have to make them; which have to create\r\ninstitutions which must generate loyalty by conspicuous utility. This\r\nmatter-of-factness is the growth even in Europe of the two greatest and\r\nnewest intellectual agencies of our time. One of these is business. We\r\nsee so much of the material fruits of commerce that we forget its\r\nmental fruits. It begets a mind desirous of things, careless of ideas,\r\nnot acquainted with the niceties of words. In all labour there should\r\nbe profit, is its motto. It is not only true that we have \"left swords\r\nfor ledgers,\" but war itself is made as much by the ledger as by the\r\nsword. The soldier--that is, the great soldier--of to-day is not a\r\nromantic animal, dashing at forlorn hopes, animated by frantic\r\nsentiment, full of fancies as to a lady-love or a sovereign; but a\r\nquiet, grave man, busied in charts, exact in sums, master of the art of\r\ntactics, occupied in trivial detail; thinking, as the Duke of\r\nWellington was said to do, MOST of the shoes of his soldiers; despising\r\nall manner of eclat and eloquence; perhaps, like Count Moltke, \"silent\r\nin seven languages\". We have reached a \"climate\" of opinion where\r\nfigures rule, where our very supporter of Divine right, as we deemed\r\nhim, our Count Bismarck, amputates kings right and left, applies the\r\ntest of results to each, and lets none live who are not to do\r\nsomething. There has in truth been a great change during the last five\r\nhundred years in the predominant occupations of the ruling part of\r\nmankind; formerly they passed their time either in exciting action or\r\ninanimate repose. A feudal baron had nothing between war and the\r\nchase--keenly animating things both--and what was called \"inglorious\r\nease\". Modern life is scanty in excitements, but incessant in quiet\r\naction. Its perpetual commerce is creating a \"stock-taking\" habit--the\r\nhabit of asking each man, thing, and institution, \"Well, what have you\r\ndone since I saw you last?\"\r\n\r\nOur physical science, which is becoming the dominant culture of\r\nthousands, and which is beginning to permeate our common literature to\r\nan extent which few watch enough, quite tends the same way. The two\r\npeculiarities are its homeliness and its inquisitiveness; its value for\r\nthe most \"stupid\" facts, as one used to call them, and its incessant\r\nwish for verification--to be sure, by tiresome seeing and hearing, that\r\nthey are facts. The old excitement of thought has half died out, or\r\nrather it is diffused in quiet pleasure over a life instead of being\r\nconcentrated in intense and eager spasms. An old philosopher--a\r\nDescartes, suppose--fancied that out of primitive truths, which he\r\ncould by ardent excogitation know, he might by pure deduction evolve\r\nthe entire universe. Intense self-examination, and intense reason\r\nwould, he thought, make out everything. The soul \"itself by itself,\"\r\ncould tell all it wanted if it would be true to its sublimer isolation.\r\nThe greatest enjoyment possible to man was that which this philosophy\r\npromises its votaries--the pleasure of being always right, and always\r\nreasoning--without ever being bound to look at anything. But our most\r\nambitious schemes of philosophy now start quite differently. Mr. Darwin\r\nbegins:--\r\n\r\n\"When on board H.M.S. Beagle, as naturalist, I was much struck with\r\ncertain facts in the distribution of the organic beings inhabiting\r\nSouth America, and in the geological relations of the present to the\r\npast inhabitants of that continent. These facts, as will be seen in the\r\nlatter chapters of this volume, seemed to throw some light on the\r\norigin of species--that mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by\r\none of our greatest philosophers. On my return home, it occurred to me,\r\nin 1837, that something might perhaps be made out on this question by\r\npatiently accumulating and reflecting on all sorts of facts which could\r\npossibly have any bearing on it. After five years' work I allowed\r\nmyself to speculate on the subject, and drew up some short notes; these\r\nI enlarged in 1844 into a sketch of the conclusions which then seemed\r\nto me probable: from that period to the present day I have steadily\r\npursued the same object. I hope that I may be excused for entering on\r\nthese personal details, as I give them to show that I have not been\r\nhasty in coming to a decision.\"\r\n\r\nIf he hopes finally to solve his great problem, it is by careful\r\nexperiments in pigeon-fancying, and other sorts of artificial\r\nvariety-making. His hero is not a self-enclosed, excited philosopher,\r\nbut \"that most skilful breeder, Sir John Sebright, who used to say,\r\nwith respect to pigeons, that he would produce any given feathers in\r\nthree years, but it would take him six years to obtain a head and a\r\nbeak\". I am not saying that the new thought is better than the old; it\r\nis no business of mine to say anything about that; I only wish to bring\r\nhome to the mind, as nothing but instances can bring it home, how\r\nmatter-of-fact, how petty, as it would at first sight look, even our\r\nmost ambitious science has become.\r\n\r\nIn the new communities which our emigrating habit now constantly\r\ncreates, this prosaic turn of mind is intensified. In the American mind\r\nand in the colonial mind there is, as contrasted with the old English\r\nmind, a LITERALNESS, a tendency to say, \"The facts are so-and-so,\r\nwhatever may be thought or fancied about them\". We used before the\r\ncivil war to say that the Americans worshipped the almighty dollar; we\r\nnow know that they can scatter money almost recklessly when they will.\r\nBut what we meant was half right--they worship visible value: obvious,\r\nundeniable, intrusive result. And in Australia and New Zealand the same\r\nturn comes uppermost. It grows from the struggle with the wilderness.\r\nPhysical difficulty is the enemy of early communities, and an incessant\r\nconflict with it for generations leaves a mark of reality on the\r\nmind--a painful mark almost to us, used to impalpable fears and the\r\nhalf-fanciful dangers of an old and complicated society. The \"new\r\nEnglands\" of all latitudes are bare-minded (if I may so say) as\r\ncompared with the \"old\".\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, the new communities of the colonised world have to\r\nchoose a government, they must choose one in which ALL the institutions\r\nare of an obvious evident utility. We catch the Americans smiling at\r\nour Queen with her secret mystery, and our Prince of Wales with his\r\nhappy inaction. It is impossible, in fact, to convince their prosaic\r\nminds that constitutional royalty is a rational government, that it is\r\nsuited to a new age and an unbroken country, that those who start\r\nafresh can start with it. The princelings who run about the world with\r\nexcellent intentions, but an entire ignorance of business, are to them\r\na locomotive advertisement that this sort of government is European in\r\nits limitations and mediaeval in its origin; that though it has yet a\r\ngreat part to play in the old States, it has no place or part in new\r\nStates. The realisme impitoyable which good critics find in a most\r\ncharacteristic part of the literature of the nineteenth century, is to\r\nbe found also in its politics. An ostentatious utility must\r\ncharacterise its creations.\r\n\r\nThe deepest interest, therefore, attaches to the problem of this essay.\r\nIf hereditary royalty had been essential to Parliamentary government,\r\nwe might well have despaired of that government. But accurate\r\ninvestigation shows that this royalty is not essential; that, upon an\r\naverage, it is not even in a high degree useful; that though a king\r\nwith high courage and fine discretion--a king with a genius for the\r\nplace--is always useful, and at rare moments priceless, yet that a\r\ncommon king, a king such as birth brings, is of no use at difficult\r\ncrises, while in the common course of things his aid is neither likely\r\nnor required--he will do nothing, and he need do nothing. But we\r\nhappily find that a new country need not fall back into the fatal\r\ndivision of powers incidental to a Presidential government; it may, if\r\nother conditions serve, obtain the ready, well-placed, identical sort\r\nof sovereignty which belongs to the English Constitution, under the\r\nunroyal form of Parliamentary government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNO. VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE PREREQUISITES OF CABINET GOVERNMENT, AND THE PECULIAR FORM WHICH\r\nTHEY HAVE ASSUMED IN ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nCabinet government is rare because its prerequisites are many. It\r\nrequires the co-existence of several national characteristics which are\r\nnot often found together in the world, and which should be perceived\r\nmore distinctly than they often are. It is fancied that the possession\r\nof a certain intelligence, and a few simple virtues, are the sole\r\nrequisites. The mental and moral qualities are necessary, but much else\r\nis necessary also. A Cabinet government is the government of a\r\ncommittee selected by the legislature, and there are therefore a double\r\nset of conditions to it: first, those which are essential to all\r\nelective governments as such; and second, those which are requisite to\r\nthis particular elective government. There are prerequisites for the\r\ngenus, and additional ones for the species.\r\n\r\nThe first prerequisite of elective government is the MUTUAL CONFIDENCE\r\nof the electors. We are so accustomed to submit to be ruled by elected\r\nMinisters, that we are apt to fancy all mankind would readily be so\r\ntoo. Knowledge and civilisation have at least made this progress, that\r\nwe instinctively, without argument, almost without consciousness, allow\r\na certain number of specified persons to choose our rulers for us. It\r\nseems to us the simplest thing in the world. But it is one of the\r\ngravest things.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar marks of semi-barbarous people are diffused distrust and\r\nindiscriminate suspicion. People, in all but the most favoured times\r\nand places, are rooted to the places where they were born, think the\r\nthoughts of those places, can endure no other thoughts. The next parish\r\neven is suspected. Its inhabitants have different usages, almost\r\nimperceptibly different, but yet different; they speak a varying\r\naccent; they use a few peculiar words; tradition says that their faith\r\nis dubious. And if the next parish is a little suspected, the next\r\ncounty is much more suspected. Here is a definite beginning of new\r\nmaxims, new thoughts, new ways: the immemorial boundary mark begins in\r\nfeeling a strange world. And if the next county is dubious, a remote\r\ncounty is untrustworthy. \"Vagrants come from thence,\" men know, and\r\nthey know nothing else. The inhabitants of the north speak a dialect\r\ndifferent from the dialect of the south: they have other laws, another\r\naristocracy, another life. In ages when distant territories are blanks\r\nin the mind, when neighbourhood is a sentiment, when locality is a\r\npassion, concerted co-operation between remote regions is impossible\r\neven on trivial matters. Neither would rely enough upon the good faith,\r\ngood sense, and good judgment of the other. Neither could enough\r\ncalculate on the other.\r\n\r\nAnd if such co-operation is not to be expected in trivial matters, it\r\nis not to be thought of in the most vital matter of government--the\r\nchoice of the executive ruler. To fancy that Northumberland in the\r\nthirteenth century would have consented to ally itself with\r\nSomersetshire for the choice of a chief magistrate is absurd; it would\r\nscarcely have allied itself to choose a hangman. Even now, if it were\r\npalpably explained, neither district would like it. But no one says at\r\na county election, \"The object of this present meeting is to choose our\r\ndelegate to what the Americans call the 'Electoral College,' to the\r\nassembly which names our first magistrate--our substitute for their\r\nPresident. Representatives from this county will meet representatives\r\nfrom other counties, from cities and boroughs, and proceed to choose\r\nour rulers.\" Such bald exposition would have been impossible in old\r\ntimes; it would be considered queer, eccentric, if it were used now.\r\nHappily, the process of election is so indirect and hidden, and the\r\nintroduction of that process was so gradual and latent, that we\r\nscarcely perceive the immense political trust we repose in each other.\r\nThe best mercantile credit seems to those who give it, natural, simple,\r\nobvious; they do not argue about it, or think about it. The best\r\npolitical credit is analogous; we trust our countrymen without\r\nremembering that we trust them.\r\n\r\nA second and very rare condition of an elective government is a CALM\r\nnational mind--a tone of mind sufficiently staple to bear the necessary\r\nexcitement of conspicuous revolutions. No barbarous, no semi-civilised\r\nnation has ever possessed this. The mass of uneducated men could not\r\nnow in England be told \"go to, choose your rulers;\" they would go wild;\r\ntheir imaginations would fancy unreal dangers, and the attempt at\r\nelection would issue in some forcible usurpation. The incalculable\r\nadvantage of august institutions in a free state is, that they prevent\r\nthis collapse. The excitement of choosing our rulers is prevented by\r\nthe apparent existence of an unchosen ruler. The poorer and more\r\nignorant classes--those who would most feel excitement, who would most\r\nbe misled by excitement--really believe that the Queen governs. You\r\ncould not explain to them the recondite difference between \"reigning\"\r\nand \"governing\"; the words necessary to express it do not exist in\r\ntheir dialect; the ideas necessary to comprehend it do not exist in\r\ntheir minds. The separation of principal power from principal station\r\nis a refinement which they could not even conceive. They fancy they are\r\ngoverned by an hereditary Queen, a Queen by the grace of God, when they\r\nare really governed by a Cabinet and a Parliament--men like themselves,\r\nchosen by themselves. The conspicuous dignity awakens the sentiment of\r\nreverence, and men, often very undignified, seize the occasion to\r\ngovern by means of it.\r\n\r\nLastly. The third condition of all elective government is what I may\r\ncall RATIONALITY, by which I mean a power involving intelligence, but\r\nyet distinct from it. A whole people electing its rulers must be able\r\nto form a distinct conception of distant objects. Mostly, the\r\n\"divinity\" that surrounds a king altogether prevents anything like a\r\nsteady conception of him. You fancy that the object of your loyalty is\r\nas much elevated above you by intrinsic nature as he is by extrinsic\r\nposition; you deify him in sentiment, as once men deified him in\r\ndoctrine. This illusion has been and still is of incalculable benefit\r\nto the human race. It prevents, indeed, men from choosing their rulers;\r\nyou cannot invest with that loyal illusion a man who was yesterday what\r\nyou are, who to-morrow may be so again, whom you chose to be what he\r\nis. But though this superstition prevents the election of rulers, it\r\nrenders possible the existence of unelected rulers. Untaught people\r\nfancy that their king, crowned with the holy crown, anointed with the\r\noil of Rheims, descended of the House of Plantagenet, is a different\r\nsort of being from any one not descended of the Royal House--not\r\ncrowned--not anointed. They believe that there is ONE man whom by\r\nmystic right they should obey; and therefore they do obey him. It is\r\nonly in later times, when the world is wider, its experience larger,\r\nand its thought colder, that the plain rule of a palpably chosen ruler\r\nis even possible.\r\n\r\nThese conditions narrowly restrict elective government. But the\r\nprerequisites of a Cabinet government are rarer still; it demands not\r\nonly the conditions I have mentioned, but the possibility likewise of a\r\ngood legislature--a legislature competent to elect a sufficient\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nNow a competent legislature is very rare. ANY permanent legislature at\r\nall, any constantly acting mechanism for enacting and repealing laws,\r\nis, though it seems to us so natural, quite contrary to the inveterate\r\nconceptions of mankind. The great majority of nations conceive of their\r\nlaw, either as something Divinely given, and therefore unalterable, or\r\nas a fundamental habit, inherited from the past to be transmitted to\r\nthe future. The English Parliament, of which the prominent functions\r\nare now legislative, was not all so once. It was rather a PRESERVATIVE\r\nbody. The custom of the realm--the aboriginal transmitted law--the law\r\nwhich was in the breast of the judges, could not be altered without the\r\nconsent of Parliament, and therefore everybody felt sure it would not\r\nbe altered except in grave, peculiar, and anomalous cases. The VALUED\r\nuse of Parliament was not half so much to alter the law, as to prevent\r\nthe laws being altered. And such too was its real use. In early\r\nsocieties it matters much more that the law should be fixed than that\r\nit should be good. Any law which the people of ignorant times enact is\r\nsure to involve many misconceptions, and to cause many evils.\r\nPerfection in legislation is not to be looked for, and is not, indeed,\r\nmuch wanted in a rude, painful, confined life. But such an age covets\r\nfixity. That men should enjoy the fruits of their labour, that the law\r\nof property should be known, that the law of marriage should be known,\r\nthat the whole course of life should be kept in a calculable track is\r\nthe summum bonum of early ages, the first desire of semi-civilised\r\nmankind. In that age men do not want to have their laws adapted, but to\r\nhave their laws steady. The passions are so powerful, force so eager,\r\nthe social bond so weak, that the august spectacle of an all but\r\nunalterable law is necessary to preserve society. In the early stages\r\nof human society all change is thought an evil. And MOST change is an\r\nevil. The conditions of life are so simple and so unvarying that any\r\ndecent sort of rules suffice so long as men know what they are. Custom\r\nis the first check on tyranny; that fixed routine of social life at\r\nwhich modern innovations chafe, and by which modern improvement is\r\nimpeded, is the primitive check on base power. The perception of\r\npolitical expediency has then hardly begun; the sense of abstract\r\njustice is weak and vague; and a rigid adherence to the fixed mould of\r\ntransmitted usage is essential to an unmarred, unspoiled, unbroken life.\r\n\r\nIn such an age a legislature continuously sitting, always making laws,\r\nalways repealing laws, would have been both an anomaly and a nuisance.\r\nBut in the present state of the civilised part of the world such\r\ndifficulties are obsolete. There is a diffused desire in civilised\r\ncommunities for an ADJUSTING legislation; for a legislation which\r\nshould adapt the inherited laws to the new wants of a world which now\r\nchanges every day. It has ceased to be necessary to maintain bad laws\r\nbecause it is necessary to have some laws. Civilisation is robust\r\nenough to bear the incision of legal improvements. But taking history\r\nat large, the rarity of Cabinets is mostly due to the greater rarity of\r\ncontinuous legislatures.\r\n\r\nOther conditions, however, limit even at the present day the area of a\r\nCabinet government. It must be possible to have not only a legislature,\r\nbut to have a competent legislature--a legislature willing to elect and\r\nwilling to maintain an efficient executive. And this is no easy matter.\r\nIt is indeed true that we need not trouble ourselves to look for that\r\nelaborate and complicated organisation which partially exists in the\r\nHouse of Commons, and which is more fully and freely expanded in plans\r\nfor improving the House of Commons. We are not now concerned with\r\nperfection or excellence; we seek only for simple fitness and bare\r\ncompetency.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of fitness are two. First, you must get a good\r\nlegislature; and next, you must keep it good. And these are by no means\r\nso nearly connected as might be thought at first sight. To keep a\r\nlegislature efficient, it must have a sufficient supply of substantial\r\nbusiness. If you employ the best set of men to do nearly nothing, they\r\nwill quarrel with each other about that nothing. Where great questions\r\nend, little parties begin. And a very happy community, with few new\r\nlaws to make, few old bad laws to repeal, and but simple foreign\r\nrelations to adjust, has great difficulty in employing a legislature.\r\nThere is nothing for it to enact, and nothing for it to settle.\r\nAccordingly, there is great danger that the legislature, being debarred\r\nfrom all other kind of business, may take to quarrelling about its\r\nelective business; that controversies as to Ministries may occupy all\r\nits time, and yet that time be perniciously employed; that a constant\r\nsuccession of feeble administrations, unable to govern and unfit to\r\ngovern, may be substituted for the proper result of Cabinet\r\ngovernment--a sufficient body of men long enough in power to evince\r\ntheir sufficiency. The exact amount of non-elective business necessary\r\nfor a Parliament which is to elect the executive cannot, of course, be\r\nformally stated. There are no numbers and no statistics in the theory\r\nof constitutions. All we can say is, that a Parliament with little\r\nbusiness, which is to be as efficient as a Parliament with much\r\nbusiness, must be in all other respects much better. An indifferent\r\nParliament may be much improved by the steadying effect of grave\r\naffairs; but a Parliament which has no such affairs must be\r\nintrinsically excellent, or it will fail utterly.\r\n\r\nBut the difficulty of keeping a good legislature, is evidently\r\nsecondary to the difficulty of first getting it. There are two kinds of\r\nnations which can elect a good Parliament. The first is a nation in\r\nwhich the mass of the people are intelligent, and in which they are\r\ncomfortable. Where there is no honest poverty, where education is\r\ndiffused, and political intelligence is common, it is easy for the mass\r\nof the people to elect a fair legislature. The idea is roughly realised\r\nin the North American colonies of England, and in the whole free States\r\nof the Union. In these countries there is no such thing as honest\r\npoverty; physical comfort, such as the poor cannot imagine here, is\r\nthere easily attainable by healthy industry. Education is diffused\r\nmuch, and is fast spreading, Ignorant emigrants from the Old World\r\noften prize the intellectual advantages of which they are themselves\r\ndestitute, and are annoyed at their inferiority in a place where\r\nrudimentary culture is so common. The greatest difficulty of such new\r\ncommunities is commonly geographical. The population is mostly\r\nscattered; and where population is sparse, discussion is difficult. But\r\nin a country very large, as we reckon in Europe, a people really\r\nintelligent, really educated, really comfortable, would soon form a\r\ngood opinion. No one can doubt that the New England States, if they\r\nwere a separate community, would have an education, a political\r\ncapacity, and an intelligence such as the numerical majority of no\r\npeople, equally numerous, has ever possessed. In a State of this sort,\r\nwhere all the community is fit to choose a sufficient legislature, it\r\nis possible, it is almost easy, to create that legislature. If the New\r\nEngland States possessed a Cabinet government as a separate nation,\r\nthey would be as renowned in the world for political sagacity as they\r\nnow are for diffused happiness.\r\n\r\nThe structure of these communities is indeed based on the principle of\r\nequality, and it is impossible that ANY such community can wholly\r\nsatisfy the severe requirements of a political theorist. In every old\r\ncommunity its primitive and guiding assumption is at war with truth. By\r\nits theory all people are entitled to the same political power, and\r\nthey can only be so entitled on the ground that in politics they are\r\nequally wise. But at the outset of an agricultural colony this\r\npostulate is as near the truth as politics want. There are in such\r\ncommunities no large properties, no great capitals, no refined\r\nclasses--every one is comfortable and homely, and no one is at all\r\nmore. Equality is not artificially established in a new colony; it\r\nestablishes itself. There is a story that among the first settlers in\r\nWestern Australia, some, who were rich, took out labourers at their own\r\nexpense, and also carriages to ride in. But soon they had to try if\r\nthey could live in the carriages. Before the masters' houses were\r\nbuilt, the labourers had gone off--they were building houses and\r\ncultivating land for themselves, and the masters were left to sit in\r\ntheir carriages. Whether this exact thing happened I do not know, but\r\nthis sort of thing has happened a thousand times. There has been a\r\nwhole series of attempts to transplant to the colonies a graduated\r\nEnglish society. But they have always failed at the first step. The\r\nrude classes at the bottom felt that they were equal to or better than\r\nthe delicate classes at the top; they shifted for themselves, and left\r\nthe \"gentle-folks\" to shift for themselves; the base of the elaborate\r\npyramid spread abroad, and the apex tumbled in and perished. In the\r\nearly ages of an agricultural colony, whether you have political\r\ndemocracy or not, social democracy you must have, for nature makes it,\r\nand not you. But in time, wealth grows and inequality begins. A and his\r\nchildren are industrious, and prosper; B and his children are idle, and\r\nfail. If manufactures on a considerable scale are established--and most\r\nyoung communities strive even by protection to establish them--the\r\ntendency to inequality is intensified. The capitalist becomes a unit\r\nwith much, and his labourers a crowd with little. After generations of\r\neducation, too, there arise varieties of culture--there will be an\r\nupper thousand, or ten thousand, of highly cultivated people in the\r\nmidst of a great nation of moderately educated people. In theory it is\r\ndesirable that this highest class of wealth and leisure should have an\r\ninfluence far out of proportion to its mere number: a perfect\r\nconstitution would find for it a delicate expedient to make its fine\r\nthought tell upon the surrounding cruder thought. But as the world\r\ngoes, when the whole of the population is as instructed and as\r\nintelligent as in the case I am supposing, we need not care much about\r\nthis. Great communities have scarcely ever--never save for transient\r\nmoments--been ruled by their highest thought. And if we can get them\r\nruled by a decent capable thought, we may be well enough contented with\r\nour work. We have done more than could be expected, though not all\r\nwhich could be desired. At any rate, an isocratic polity--a polity\r\nwhere every one votes, and where every one votes alike--is, in a\r\ncommunity of sound education and diffused intelligence, a conceivable\r\ncase of Cabinet government. It satisfies the essential condition; there\r\nis a people able to elect, a Parliament able to choose.\r\n\r\nBut suppose the mass of the people are not able to elect--and this is\r\nthe case with the numerical majority of all but the rarest nations--how\r\nis a Cabinet government to be then possible? It is only possible in\r\nwhat I may venture to call DEFERENTIAL nations. It has been thought\r\nstrange, but there ARE nations in which the numerous unwiser part\r\nwishes to be ruled by the less numerous wiser part. The numerical\r\nmajority--whether by custom or by choice, is immaterial--is ready, is\r\neager to delegate its power of choosing its ruler to a certain select\r\nminority. It abdicates in favour of its elite, and consents to obey\r\nwhoever that elite may confide in. It acknowledges as its secondary\r\nelectors--as the choosers of its government--an educated minority, at\r\nonce competent and unresisted; it has a kind of loyalty to some\r\nsuperior persons who are fit to choose a good government, and whom no\r\nother class opposes. A nation in such a happy state as this has obvious\r\nadvantages for constructing a Cabinet government. It has the best\r\npeople to elect a legislature, and therefore it may fairly be expected\r\nto choose a good legislature--a legislature competent to select a good\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nEngland is the type of deferential countries, and the manner in which\r\nit is so, and has become so, is extremely curious. The middle\r\nclasses--the ordinary majority of educated men--are in the present day\r\nthe despotic power in England. \"Public opinion,\" nowadays, \"is the\r\nopinion of the bald-headed man at the back of the omnibus.\" It is NOT\r\nthe opinion of the aristocratical classes as such; or of the most\r\neducated or refined classes as such; it is simply the opinion of the\r\nordinary mass of educated, but still commonplace mankind. If you look\r\nat the mass of the constituencies, you will see that they are not very\r\ninteresting people; and perhaps if you look behind the scenes and see\r\nthe people who manipulate and work the constituencies, you will find\r\nthat these are yet more uninteresting. The English constitution in its\r\npalpable form is this--the mass of the people yield obedience to a\r\nselect few; and when you see this select few, you perceive that though\r\nnot of the lowest class, nor of an unrespectable class, they are yet of\r\na heavy sensible class--the last people in the world to whom, if they\r\nwere drawn up in a row, an immense nation would ever give an exclusive\r\npreference.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the mass of the English people yield a deference rather to\r\nsomething else that to their rulers. They defer to what we may call the\r\nTHEATRICAL SHOW of society. A certain state passes before them; a\r\ncertain pomp of great men; a certain spectacle of beautiful women; a\r\nwonderful scene of wealth and enjoyment is displayed, and they are\r\ncoerced by it. Their imagination is bowed down; they feel they are not\r\nequal to the life which is revealed to them. Courts and aristocracies\r\nhave the great quality which rules the multitude, though philosophers\r\ncan see nothing in it--visibility. Courtiers can do what others cannot.\r\nA common man may as well try to rival the actors on the stage in their\r\nacting, as the aristocracy in THEIR acting. The higher world, as it\r\nlooks from without, is a stage on which the actors walk their parts\r\nmuch better than the spectators can. This play is played in every\r\ndistrict. Every rustic feels that his house is not like my lord's\r\nhouse; his life like my lord's life; his wife like my lady. The climax\r\nof the play is the Queen: nobody supposes that their house is like the\r\ncourt; their life like her life; her orders like their orders. There is\r\nin England a certain charmed spectacle which imposes on the many, and\r\nguides their fancies as it will. As a rustic on coming to London finds\r\nhimself in presence of a great show and vast exhibition of\r\ninconceivable mechanical things, so by the structure of our society, he\r\nfinds himself face to face with a great exhibition of political things\r\nwhich he could not have imagined, which he could not make--to which he\r\nfeels in himself scarcely anything analogous.\r\n\r\nPhilosophers may deride this superstition, but its results are\r\ninestimable. By the spectacle of this august society, countless\r\nignorant men and women are induced to obey the few nominal\r\nelectors--the Ll0 borough renters, and the L50 county renters--who have\r\nnothing imposing about them, nothing which would attract the eye or\r\nfascinate the fancy. What impresses men is not mind, but the result of\r\nmind. And the greatest of these results is this wonderful spectacle of\r\nsociety, which is ever new, and yet ever the same; in which accidents\r\npass and essence remains; in which one generation dies and another\r\nsucceeds, as if they were birds in a cage, or animals in a menagerie;\r\nof which it seems almost more than a metaphor to treat the parts as\r\nlimbs of a perpetual living thing, so silently do they seem to change,\r\nso wonderfully and so perfectly does the conspicuous life of the new\r\nyear take the place of the conspicuous life of last year. The apparent\r\nrulers of the English nation are like the most imposing personages of a\r\nsplendid procession: it is by them the mob are influenced; it is they\r\nwhom the spectators cheer. The real rulers are secreted in second-rate\r\ncarriages; no one cares for them or asks about them, but they are\r\nobeyed implicitly and unconsciously by reason of the splendour of those\r\nwho eclipsed and preceded them.\r\n\r\nIt is quite true that this imaginative sentiment is supported by a\r\nsensation of political satisfaction. It cannot be said that the mass of\r\nthe English people are well off. There are whole classes who have not a\r\nconception of what the higher orders call comfort; who have not the\r\nprerequisites of moral existence; who cannot lead the life that becomes\r\na man. But the most miserable of these classes do not impute their\r\nmisery to politics. If a political agitator were to lecture to the\r\npeasants of Dorsetshire, and try to excite political dissatisfaction,\r\nit is much more likely that he would be pelted than that he would\r\nsucceed. Of Parliament these miserable creatures know scarcely\r\nanything; of the Cabinet they never heard. But they would say that,\r\n\"for all they have heard, the Queen is very good\"; and rebelling\r\nagainst the structure of society is to their minds rebelling against\r\nthe Queen, who rules that society, in whom all its most impressive\r\npart--the part that they know--culminates. The mass of the English\r\npeople are politically contented as well as politically deferential.\r\n\r\nA deferential community, even though its lowest classes are not\r\nintelligent, is far more suited to a Cabinet government than any kind\r\nof democratic country, because it is more suited to political\r\nexcellence. The highest classes can rule in it; and the highest classes\r\nmust, as such, have more political ability than the lower classes. A\r\nlife of labour, an incomplete education, a monotonous occupation, a\r\ncareer in which the hands are used much and the judgment is used\r\nlittle, cannot create as much flexible thought, as much applicable\r\nintelligence, as a life of leisure, a long culture, a varied\r\nexperience, an existence by which the judgment is incessantly\r\nexercised, and by which it may be incessantly improved. A country of\r\nrespectful poor, though far less happy than where there are no poor to\r\nbe respectful, is nevertheless far more fitted for the best government.\r\nYou can use the best classes of the respectful country; you can only\r\nuse the worst where every man thinks he is as good as every other.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that no difficulty can be greater than that of founding a\r\ndeferential nation. Respect is traditional; it is given not to what is\r\nproved to be good, but to what is known to be old. Certain classes in\r\ncertain nations retain by common acceptance a marked political\r\npreference, because they have always possessed it, and because they\r\ninherit a sort of pomp which seems to make them worthy of it. But in a\r\nnew colony, in a community where merit MAY be equal, and where there\r\nCANNOT be traditional marks of merit and fitness, it is obvious that a\r\npolitical deference can be yielded to higher culture only upon proof,\r\nfirst of its existence, and next of its political value. But it is\r\nnearly impossible to give such a proof so as to satisfy persons of less\r\nculture. In a future and better age of the world it may be effected;\r\nbut in this age the requisite premises scarcely exist; if the\r\ndiscussion be effectually open, if the debate be fairly begun, it is\r\nhardly possible to obtain a rational, an argumentative acquiescence in\r\nthe rule of the cultivated few. As yet the few rule by their hold, not\r\nover the reason of the multitude, but over their imaginations, and\r\ntheir habits; over their fancies as to distant things they do not know\r\nat all, over their customs as to near things which they know very well.\r\n\r\nA deferential community in which the bulk of the people are ignorant,\r\nis therefore in a state of what is called in mechanics unstable\r\nequilibrium. If the equilibrium is once disturbed there is no tendency\r\nto return to it, but rather to depart from it. A cone balanced on its\r\npoint is in unstable equilibrium, for if you push it ever so little it\r\nwill depart farther and farther from its position and fall to the\r\nearth. So in communities where the masses are ignorant but respectful,\r\nif you once permit the ignorant class to begin to rule you may bid\r\nfarewell to deference for ever. Their demagogues will inculcate, their\r\nnewspapers will recount, that the rule of the existing dynasty (the\r\npeople) is better than the rule of the fallen dynasty (the\r\naristocracy). A people very rarely hears two sides of a subject in\r\nwhich it is much interested; the popular organs take up the side which\r\nis acceptable, and none but the popular organs in fact reach the\r\npeople. A people NEVER hears censure of itself. No one will tell it\r\nthat the educated minority whom it dethroned governed better or more\r\nwisely than it governs. A democracy will never, save after an awful\r\ncatastrophe, return what has once been conceded to it, for to do so\r\nwould be to admit an inferiority in itself, of which, except by some\r\nalmost unbearable misfortune, it could never be convinced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNO. IX.\r\n\r\nITS HISTORY, AND THE EFFECTS OF THAT HISTORY.--CONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nA volume might seem wanted to say anything worth saying[12] on the\r\nHistory of the English Constitution, and a great and new volume might\r\nstill be written on it, if a competent writer took it in hand. The\r\nsubject has never been treated by any one combining the lights of the\r\nnewest research and the lights of the most matured philosophy. Since\r\nthe masterly book of Hallam was written, both political thought and\r\nhistorical knowledge have gained much, and we might have a treatise\r\napplying our strengthened calculus to our augmented facts. I do not\r\npretend that I could write such a book, but there are a few salient\r\nparticulars which may be fitly brought together, both because of their\r\npast interest and of their present importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n[12] Since the first edition of this book was published several\r\nvaluable works have appeared, which, on many points, throw much light\r\non our early constitutional history, especially Mr. Stubbs' Select\r\nCharters and other Illustrations of English Constitutional History,\r\nfrom the Earliest Times to the Reign of Edward the First, Mr. Freeman's\r\nlecture on \"The Growth of the English Constitution,\" and the chapter on\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon Constitution in his History of the Norman Conquest: but\r\nwe have not yet a great and authoritative work on the whole subject\r\nsuch as I wished for when I wrote the passage in the text, and as it is\r\nmost desirable that we should have.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a certain common polity, or germ of polity, which we find in\r\nall the rude nations that have attained civilisation. These nations\r\nseem to begin in what I may call a consultative and tentative\r\nabsolutism. The king of early days, in vigorous nations, was not\r\nabsolute as despots now are; there was then no standing army to repress\r\nrebellion, no organised ESPIONAGE to spy out discontent, no skilled\r\nbureaucracy to smooth the ruts of obedient life. The early king was\r\nindeed consecrated by a religious sanction; he was essentially a man\r\napart, a man above others, divinely anointed or even God-begotten. But\r\nin nations capable of freedom this religious domination was never\r\ndespotic. There was indeed no legal limit; the very words could not be\r\ntranslated into the dialect of those times. The notion of law as we\r\nhave it--of a rule imposed by human authority, capable of being altered\r\nby that authority, when it likes, and in fact, so altered\r\nhabitually--could not be conveyed to early nations, who regarded law\r\nhalf as an invincible prescription, and half as a Divine revelation.\r\nLaw \"came out of the king's mouth\"; he gave it as Solomon gave\r\njudgment--embedded in the particular case, and upon the authority of\r\nHeaven as well as his own. A Divine limit to the Divine revealer was\r\nimpossible, and there was no other source of law. But though there was\r\nno legal limit, there was a practical limit to subjection in (what may\r\nbe called) the pagan part of human nature--the inseparable obstinacy of\r\nfreemen. They NEVER would do exactly what they were told.\r\n\r\nTo early royalty, as Homer describes it in Greece and as we may well\r\nimagine it elsewhere, there were always two adjuncts: one the \"old\r\nmen,\" the men of weight, the council, the _boulé_, of which the king\r\nasked advice, from the debates in which the king tried to learn what he\r\ncould do and what he ought to do. Besides this there was the _agorá_,\r\nthe purely listening assembly, as some have called it, but the\r\nTENTATIVE assembly, as I think it might best be called. The king came\r\ndown to his assembled people in form to announce his will, but in\r\nreality, speaking in very modern words, to \"feel his way\". He was\r\nsacred, no doubt; and popular, very likely; still he was half like a\r\npopular Premier speaking to a high-spirited chamber; there were limits\r\nto his authority and power--limits which he would discover by trying\r\nwhether eager cheers received his mandate, or only hollow murmurs and a\r\nthinking silence.\r\n\r\nThis polity is a good one for its era and its place, but there is a\r\nfatal defect in it. The reverential associations upon which the\r\ngovernment is built are transmitted according to one law, and the\r\ncapacity needful to work the government is transmitted according to\r\nanother law. The popular homage clings to the line of god-descended\r\nkings; it is transmitted by inheritance. But very soon that line comes\r\nto a child or an idiot, or one by some defect or other incapable. Then\r\nwe find everywhere the truth of the old saying, that liberty thrives\r\nunder weak princes; then the listening assembly begins not only to\r\nmurmur, but to speak; then the grave council begins not so much to\r\nsuggest as to inculcate, not so much to advise as to enjoin.\r\n\r\nMr. Grote has told at length how out of these appendages of the\r\noriginal kingdom the free States of Greece derived their origin, and\r\nhow they gradually grew--the oligarchical States expanding the council,\r\nand the democratical expanding the assembly. The history has as many\r\nvarieties in detail as there were Greek cities, but the essence is the\r\nsame everywhere. The political characteristic of the early Greeks, and\r\nof the early Romans, too, is that out of the tentacula of a monarchy\r\nthey developed the organs of a republic.\r\n\r\nEnglish history has been in substance the same, though its form is\r\ndifferent, and its growth far slower and longer. The scale was larger,\r\nand the elements more various. A Greek city soon got rid of its kings,\r\nfor the political sacredness of the monarch would not bear the daily\r\ninspection and constant criticism of an eager and talking multitude.\r\nEverywhere in Greece the slave population--the most ignorant, and\r\ntherefore the most unsusceptible of intellectual influences--was struck\r\nout of the account. But England began as a kingdom of considerable\r\nsize, inhabited by distinct races, none of them fit for prosaic\r\ncriticism, and all subject to the superstition of royalty. In early\r\nEngland, too, royalty was much more than a superstition. A very strong\r\nexecutive was needed to keep down a divided, an armed, and an impatient\r\ncountry; and therefore the problem of political development was\r\ndelicate. A formed free government in a homogeneous nation may have a\r\nstrong executive; but during the transition state, while the republic\r\nis in course of development and the monarchy in course of decay, the\r\nexecutive is of necessity weak. The polity is divided, and its action\r\nfeeble and failing. The different orders of English people have\r\nprogressed, too, at different rates. The change in the state of the\r\nhigher classes since the Middle Ages is enormous, and it is all\r\nimprovement; but the lower have varied little, and many argue that in\r\nsome important respects they have got worse, even if in others they\r\nhave got better. The development of the English Constitution was of\r\nnecessity slow, because a quick one would have destroyed the executive\r\nand killed the State, and because the most numerous classes, who\r\nchanged very little, were not prepared for any catastrophic change in\r\nour institutions.\r\n\r\nI cannot presume to speak of the time before the Conquest, and the\r\nexact nature even of all Anglo-Norman institutions is perhaps dubious:\r\nat least, in nearly all cases there have been many controversies.\r\nPolitical zeal, whether Whig or Tory, has wanted to find a model in the\r\npast; and the whole state of society being confused, the precedents\r\naltering with the caprice of men and the chance of events, ingenious\r\nadvocacy has had a happy field. But all that I need speak of is quite\r\nplain. There was a great \"council\" of the realm, to which the king\r\nsummoned the most considerable persons in England, the persons he most\r\nwanted to advise him, and the persons whose tempers he was most anxious\r\nto ascertain. Exactly who came to it at first is obscure and\r\nunimportant. I need not distinguish between the \"magnum concilium in\r\nParliament\" and the \"magnum concilium out of Parliament\". Gradually the\r\nprincipal assemblies summoned by the English sovereign took the precise\r\nand definite form of Lords and Commons, as in their outside we now see\r\nthem. But their real nature was very different. The Parliament of\r\nto-day is a ruling body; the mediaeval Parliament was, if I may so say,\r\nan EXPRESSIVE body. Its function was to tell the executive--the\r\nking--what the nation wished he should do; to some extent, to guide him\r\nby new wisdom, and, to a very great extent, to guide him by new facts.\r\nThese facts were their own feelings, which were the feelings of the\r\npeople, because they were part and parcel of the people. From thence\r\nthe king learned, or had the means to learn, what the nation would\r\nendure, and what it would not endure;--what he might do, and what he\r\nmight not do. If he much mistook this, there was a rebellion.\r\n\r\nThere are, as is well known, three great periods in the English\r\nConstitution. The first of these is the ante-Tudor period. The English\r\nParliament then seemed to be gaining extraordinary strength and power.\r\nThe title to the Crown was uncertain; some monarchs were imbecile. Many\r\nambitious men wanted to \"take the people into partnership\". Certain\r\nprecedents of that time were cited with grave authority centuries\r\nafter, when the time of freedom had really arrived. But the causes of\r\nthis rapid growth soon produced an even more sudden decline. Confusion\r\nfostered it, and confusion destroyed it. The structure of society then\r\nwas feudal; the towns were only an adjunct and a make-weight. The\r\nprincipal popular force was an aristocratic force, acting with the\r\nco-operation of the gentry and yeomanry, and resting on the loyal\r\nfealty of sworn retainers. The head of this force, on whom its\r\nefficiency depended, was the high nobility. But the high nobility\r\nkilled itself out. The great barons who adhered to the \"Red Rose\" or\r\nthe \"White Rose,\" or who fluctuated from one to the other, became\r\npoorer, fewer, and less potent every year. When the great struggle\r\nended at Bosworth, a large part of the greatest combatants were gone.\r\nThe restless, aspiring, rich barons, who made the civil war, were\r\nbroken by it. Henry VII. attained a kingdom in which there was a\r\nParliament to advise, but scarcely a Parliament to control.\r\n\r\nThe consultative government of the ante-Tudor period had little\r\nresemblance to some of the modern governments which French philosophers\r\ncall by that name. The French Empire, I believe, calls itself so. But\r\nits assemblies are symmetrical \"shams\". They are elected by a universal\r\nsuffrage, by the ballot, and in districts once marked out with an eye\r\nto equality, and still retaining a look of equality. But our English\r\nParliaments were UNsymmetrical realities. They were elected anyhow; the\r\nsheriff had a considerable licence in sending writs to boroughs, that\r\nis, he could in part pick its constituencies; and in each borough there\r\nwas a rush and scramble for the franchise, so that the strongest local\r\nparty got it, whether few or many. But in England at that time there\r\nwas a great and distinct desire to know the opinion of the nation,\r\nbecause there was a real and close necessity. The nation was wanted to\r\ndo something--to assist the sovereign in some war, to pay some old\r\ndebt, to contribute its force and aid in the critical conjuncture of\r\nthe time. It would not have suited the ante-Tudor kings to have had a\r\nfictitious assembly; they would have lost their sole FEELER, their only\r\ninstrument for discovering national opinion. Nor could they have\r\nmanufactured such an assembly if they wished. The instrument in that\r\nbehalf is the centralised executive, and there was then no 'prefet' by\r\nwhom the opinion of a rural locality could be made to order, and\r\nadjusted to suit the wishes of the capital. Looking at the mode of\r\nelection a theorist would say that these Parliaments were but \"chance\"\r\ncollections of influential Englishmen. There would be many corrections\r\nand limitations to add to that statement if it were wanted to make it\r\naccurate, but the statement itself hits exactly the principal\r\nexcellence of those Parliaments. If not \"chance\" collections of\r\nEnglishmen, they were \"undesigned\" collections; no administrations made\r\nthem or could make them. They were bona-fide counsellors, whose opinion\r\nmight be wise or unwise, but was anyhow of paramount importance,\r\nbecause their co-operation was wanted for what was in hand.\r\n\r\nLegislation as a positive power was very secondary in those old\r\nParliaments. I believe no statute at all, as far as we know, was passed\r\nin the reign of Richard I., and all the ante-Tudor acts together would\r\nlook meagre enough to a modern Parliamentary agent who had to live by\r\nthem. But the negative action of Parliament upon the law was essential\r\nto its whole idea, and ran through every part of its use. That the king\r\ncould not change what was then the almost sacred datum of the common\r\nlaw, without seeing whether his nation liked it or not, was an\r\nessential part of the \"tentative\" system. The king had to feel his way\r\nin this exceptional, singular act, as those ages deemed original\r\nlegislation, as well as in lesser acts. The legislation was his at\r\nlast; he enacted after consulting his Lords and Commons; his was the\r\nsacred mouth which gave holy firmness to the enactment; but he only\r\ndared alter the rule regulating the common life of his people after\r\nconsulting those people; he would not have been obeyed if he had not,\r\nby a rude age which did not fear civil war as we fear it now. Many most\r\nimportant enactments of that period (and the fact is most\r\ncharacteristic) are declaratory acts. They do not profess to enjoin by\r\ninherent authority what the law shall in future be, but to state and\r\nmark what the law is; they are declarations of immemorial custom, not\r\nprecepts of new duties. Even in the \"Great Charter\" the notion of new\r\nenactments was secondary, it was a great mixture of old and new; it was\r\na sort of compact defining what was doubtful in floating custom, and\r\nwas re-enacted over and over again, as boundaries are perambulated once\r\na year, and rights and claims tending to desuetude thereby made patent\r\nand cleared of new obstructions. In truth, such great \"charters\" were\r\nrather treaties between different orders and factions, confirming\r\nancient rights, or what claimed to be such, than laws in our ordinary\r\nsense. They were the \"deeds of arrangement\" of mediaeval society\r\naffirmed and re-affirmed from time to time, and the principal\r\ncontroversy was, of course, between the king and nation--the king\r\ntrying to see how far the nation would let him go, and the nation\r\nmurmuring and recalcitrating, and seeing how many acts of\r\nadministration they could prevent, and how many of its claims they\r\ncould resist.\r\n\r\nSir James Mackintosh says that Magna Charta \"converted the right of\r\ntaxation into the shield of liberty,\" but it did nothing of the sort.\r\nThe liberty existed before, and the right to be taxed was an\r\nefflorescence and instance of it, not a sub-stratum or a cause. The\r\nnecessity of consulting the great council of the realm before taxation,\r\nthe principle that the declaration of grievances by the Parliament was\r\nto precede the grant of supplies to the sovereign, are but conspicuous\r\ninstances of the primitive doctrine of the ante-Tudor period, that the\r\nking must consult the great council of the realm, before he did\r\nanything, since he always wanted help. The right of self-taxation was\r\njustly inserted in the \"great treaty\"; but it would have been a dead\r\nletter, save for the armed force and aristocratic organisation which\r\ncompelled the king to make a treaty; it was a result, not a basis--an\r\nexample, not a cause.\r\n\r\nThe civil wars of many years killed out the old councils (if I might so\r\nsay): that is, destroyed three parts of the greater nobility, who were\r\nits most potent members, tired the small nobility and the gentry, and\r\noverthrew the aristocratic organisation on which all previous effectual\r\nresistance to the sovereign had been based.\r\n\r\nThe second period of the British Constitution begins with the accession\r\nof the House of Tudor, and goes down to 1688; it is in substance the\r\nhistory of the growth, development, and gradually acquired supremacy of\r\nthe new great council. I have no room and no occasion to narrate again\r\nthe familiar history of the many steps by which the slavish Parliament\r\nof Henry VIII. grew into the murmuring Parliament of Queen Elizabeth,\r\nthe mutinous Parliament of James I., and the rebellious Parliament of\r\nCharles I. The steps were many, but the energy was one--the growth of\r\nthe English middle-class, using that word in its most inclusive sense,\r\nand its animation under the influence of Protestantism. No one, I\r\nthink, can doubt that Lord Macaulay is right in saying that political\r\ncauses would not alone have then provoked such a resistance to the\r\nsovereign unless propelled by religious theory. Of course the English\r\npeople went to and fro from Catholicism to Protestantism, and from\r\nProtestantism to Catholicism (not to mention that the Protestantism was\r\nof several shades and sects), just as the first Tudor kings and queens\r\nwished. But that was in the pre-Puritan era. The mass of Englishmen\r\nwere in an undecided state, just as Hooper tells us his father\r\nwas--\"Not believing in Protestantism, yet not disinclined to it\".\r\nGradually, however, a strong Evangelic spirit (as we should now speak)\r\nand a still stronger anti-Papal spirit entered into the middle sort of\r\nEnglishmen, and added to that force, fibre, and substance which they\r\nhave never wanted, an ideal warmth and fervour which they have almost\r\nalways wanted. Hence the saying that Cromwell founded the English\r\nConstitution. Of course, in seeming, Cromwell's work died with him; his\r\ndynasty was rejected, his republic cast aside; but the spirit which\r\nculminated in him never sank again, never ceased to be a potent, though\r\noften a latent and volcanic force in the country. Charles II. said that\r\nhe would never go again on his travels for anything or anybody; and he\r\nwell knew that though the men whom he met at Worcester might be dead,\r\nstill the spirit which warmed them was alive and young in others.\r\n\r\nBut the Cromwellian republic and the strict Puritan creed were utterly\r\nhateful to most Englishmen. They were, if I may venture on saying so,\r\nlike the \"Rouge\" element in France and elsewhere--the sole\r\nrevolutionary force in the entire State, and were hated as such. That\r\nforce could do little of itself; indeed, its bare appearance tended to\r\nfrighten and alienate the moderate and dull as well as the refined and\r\nreasoning classes. Alone it was impotent against the solid clay of the\r\nEnglish apathetic nature. But give this fiery element a body of\r\ndecent-looking earth; give it an excuse for breaking out on an\r\noccasion, when the decent, the cultivated, and aristocratic classes\r\ncould join with it, and they would conquer by means of it, and it could\r\nbe disguised in their covering.\r\n\r\nSuch an excuse was found in 1688. James II., by incredible and\r\npertinacious folly, irritated not only the classes which had fought\r\nAGAINST his father, but also those who had fought FOR his father. He\r\noffended the Anglican classes as well as the Puritan classes; all the\r\nWhig nobles, and half the Tory nobles, as well as the dissenting\r\nbourgeois. The rule of Parliament was established by the concurrence of\r\nthe usual supporters of royalty with the usual opponents of it. But the\r\nresult was long weak. Our revolution has been called the minimum of a\r\nrevolution, because in law, at least, it only changed the dynasty, but\r\nexactly on that account it was the greatest shock to the common\r\nmultitude, who see the dynasty but see nothing else. The support of the\r\nmain aristocracy held together the bulk of the deferential classes, but\r\nit held them together imperfectly, uneasily, and unwillingly. Huge\r\nmasses of crude prejudice swayed hither and thither for many years. If\r\nan able Stuart had with credible sincerity professed Protestantism\r\nprobably he might have overturned the House of Hanover. So strong was\r\ninbred reverence for hereditary right, that until the accession of\r\nGeorge III. the English Government was always subject to the unceasing\r\nattrition of a competitive sovereign.\r\n\r\nThis was the result of what I insist on tediously, but what is most\r\nnecessary to insist on, for it is a cardinal particular in the whole\r\ntopic. Many of the English people--the higher and more educated\r\nportion--had come to comprehend the nature of constitutional\r\ngovernment, but the mass did not comprehend it. They looked to the\r\nsovereign as the Government, and to the sovereign only. These were\r\ncarried forward by the magic of the aristocracy and principally by the\r\ninfluence of the great Whig families with their adjuncts. Without that\r\naid reason or liberty would never have held them.\r\n\r\nThough the rule of Parliament was definitely established in 1688, yet\r\nthe mode of exercising that rule has since changed. At first Parliament\r\ndid not know how to exercise it; the organisation of parties and the\r\nappointment of Cabinets by parties grew up in the manner Macaulay has\r\ndescribed so well. Up to the latest period the sovereign was supposed,\r\nto a most mischievous extent, to interfere in the choice of the persons\r\nto be Ministers. When George III. finally became insane, in 1810, every\r\none believed that George IV., on assuming power as Prince Regent, would\r\nturn out Mr. Perceval's Government and empower Lord Grey or Lord\r\nGrenville, the Whig leaders, to form another. The Tory Ministry was\r\ncarrying on a successful war--a war of existence--against Napoleon; but\r\nin the people's minds, the necessity at such an occasion for an\r\nunchanged Government did not outweigh the fancy that George IV. was a\r\nWhig. And a Whig it is true he had been before the French Revolution,\r\nwhen he lived an indescribable life in St. James's Street with Mr. Fox.\r\nBut Lord Grey and Lord Grenville were rigid men, and had no immoral\r\nsort of influence. What liberalism of opinion the Regent ever had was\r\nfrightened out of him (as of other people) by the Reign of Terror. He\r\nfelt, according to the saying of another monarch, that \"he lived by\r\nbeing a royalist\". It soon appeared that he was most anxious to retain\r\nMr. Perceval, and that he was most eager to quarrel with the Whig\r\nLords. As we all know, he kept the Ministry whom he found in office;\r\nbut that it should have been thought he could then change them, is a\r\nsignificant example how exceedingly modern our notions of the despotic\r\naction of Parliament in fact are.\r\n\r\nBy the steps of the struggle thus rudely mentioned (and by others which\r\nI have no room to speak of, nor need I), the change which in the Greek\r\ncities was effected both in appearance and in fact, has been effected\r\nin England, though in reality only, and not in outside. Here, too, the\r\nappendages of a monarchy have been converted into the essence of a\r\nrepublic; only here, because of a more numerous heterogeneous political\r\npopulation, it is needful to keep the ancient show while we secretly\r\ninterpolate the new reality.\r\n\r\nThis long and curious history has left its trace on almost every part\r\nof our present political condition; its effects lie at the root of many\r\nof our most important controversies; and because these effects are not\r\nrightly perceived, many of these controversies are misconceived.\r\n\r\nOne of the most curious peculiarities of the English people is its\r\ndislike of the executive government. We are not in this respect \"un\r\nvrai peuple moderne,\" like the Americans. The Americans conceive of the\r\nexecutive as one of their appointed agents; when it intervenes in\r\ncommon life, it does so, they consider, in virtue of the mandate of the\r\nsovereign people, and there is no invasion or dereliction of freedom in\r\nthat people interfering with itself. The French, the Swiss, and all\r\nnations who breathe the full atmosphere of the nineteenth century,\r\nthink so too. The material necessities of this age require a strong\r\nexecutive; a nation destitute of it cannot be clean, or healthy, or\r\nvigorous, like a nation possessing it. By definition, a nation calling\r\nitself free should have no jealousy of the executive, for freedom means\r\nthat the nation, the political part of the nation, wields the\r\nexecutive. But our history has reversed the English feeling: our\r\nfreedom is the result of centuries of resistance, more or less legal,\r\nor more or less illegal, more or less audacious, or more or less timid,\r\nto the executive government. We have, accordingly, inherited the\r\ntraditions of conflict, and preserve them in the fulness of victory. We\r\nlook on State action, not as our own action, but as alien action; as an\r\nimposed tyranny from without, not as the consummated result of our own\r\norganised wishes. I remember at the census of 1851 hearing a very\r\nsensible old lady say that the \"liberties of England were at an end\";\r\nif Government might be thus inquisitorial, if they might ask who slept\r\nin your house, or what your age was, what, she argued, might they not\r\nask and what might they not do?\r\n\r\nThe natural impulse of the English people is to resist authority. The\r\nintroduction of effectual policemen was not liked; I know people, old\r\npeople, I admit, who to this day consider them an infringement of\r\nfreedom, and an imitation of the gendarmes of France. If the original\r\npolicemen had been started with the present helmets, the result might\r\nhave been dubious; there might have been a cry of military tyranny, and\r\nthe inbred insubordination of the English people might have prevailed\r\nover the very modern love of PERFECT peace and order. The old notion\r\nthat the Government is an extrinsic agency still rules our\r\nimaginations, though it is no longer true, and though in calm and\r\nintellectual moments we well know it is not. Nor is it merely our\r\nhistory which produces this effect; we might get over that; but the\r\nresults of that history co-operate. Our double Government so acts: when\r\nwe want to point the antipathy to the executive, we refer to the\r\njealousy of the Crown, so deeply embedded in the very substance of\r\nconstitutional authority; so many people are loth to admit the Queen,\r\nin spite of law and fact, to be the people's appointee and agent, that\r\nit is a good rhetorical emphasis to speak of her prerogative as\r\nsomething NON-popular, and therefore to be distrusted. By the very\r\nnature of our government our executive cannot be liked and trusted as\r\nthe Swiss or the American is liked and trusted.\r\n\r\nOut of the same history and the same results proceed our tolerance of\r\nthose \"local authorities\" which so puzzle many foreigners. In the\r\nstruggle with the Crown these local centres served as props and\r\nfulcrums. In the early Parliaments it was the local bodies who sent\r\nmembers to Parliament, the counties, and the boroughs; and in that way,\r\nand because of THEIR free life, the Parliament was free too. If active\r\nreal bodies had not sent the representatives, they would have been\r\npowerless. This is very much the reason why our old rights of suffrage\r\nwere so various; the Government let whatever people happened to be the\r\nstrongest in each town choose the members. They applied to the electing\r\nbodies the test of \"natural selection\"; whatever set of people were\r\nlocally strong enough to elect, did so. Afterwards in the civil war,\r\nmany of the corporations, like that of London, were important bases of\r\nresistance. The case of London is typical and remarkable. Probably, if\r\nthere is any body more than another which an educated Englishman\r\nnowadays regards with little favour, it is the Corporation of London.\r\nHe connects it with hereditary abuses perfectly preserved, with large\r\nrevenues imperfectly accounted for, with a system which stops the\r\nprincipal city government at an old archway, with the perpetuation of a\r\nhundred detestable parishes, with the maintenance of a horde of\r\nluxurious and useless bodies. For the want of all which makes Paris\r\nnice and splendid we justly reproach the Corporation of London; for the\r\nexistence of much of what makes London mean and squalid we justly\r\nreproach it too. Yet the Corporation of London was for centuries a\r\nbulwark of English liberty. The conscious support of the near and\r\norganised capital gave the Long Parliament a vigour and vitality which\r\nthey could have found nowhere else. Their leading patriots took refuge\r\nin the City, and the nearest approach to an English \"sitting in\r\npermanence\" is the committee at Guildhall, where all members \"that came\r\nwere to have voices\". Down to George III.'s time the City was a useful\r\ncentre of popular judgment. Here, as elsewhere, we have built into our\r\npolity pieces of the scaffolding by which it was erected.\r\n\r\nDe Tocqueville indeed used to maintain that in this matter the English\r\nwere not merely historically excusable but likewise politically\r\njudicious. He founded what may be called the culte of corporations. And\r\nit was natural, that in France, where there is scarcely any power of\r\nself-organisation in the people, where the prefet must be asked upon\r\nevery subject, and take the initiative in every movement, a solitary\r\nthinker should be repelled from the exaggerations of which he knew the\r\nevil, to the contrary exaggeration of which he did not. But in a\r\ncountry like England where business is in the air, where we can\r\norganise a vigilance committee on every abuse and an executive\r\ncommittee for every remedy--as a matter of political instruction, which\r\nwas De Tocqueville's point--we need not care how much power is\r\ndelegated to outlying bodies, and how much is kept for the central\r\nbody. We have had the instruction municipalities could give us: we have\r\nbeen through all that. Now we are quite grown up, and can put away\r\nchildish things.\r\n\r\nThe same causes account for the innumerable anomalies of our polity. I\r\nown that I do not entirely sympathise with the horror of these\r\nanomalies which haunts some of our best critics. It is natural that\r\nthose who by special and admirable culture have come to look at all\r\nthings upon the artistic side, should start back from these queer\r\npeculiarities. But it is natural also that persons used to analyse\r\npolitical institutions should look at these anomalies with a little\r\ntenderness and a little interest. They MAY have something to teach us.\r\nPolitical philosophy is still more imperfect; it has been framed from\r\nobservations taken upon regular specimens of politics and States; as to\r\nthese its teaching is most valuable. But we must ever remember that its\r\ndata are imperfect. The lessons are good where its primitive\r\nassumptions hold, but may be false where those assumptions fail. A\r\nphilosophical politician regards a political anomaly as a scientific\r\nphysician regards a rare disease--it is to him an \"interesting case\".\r\nThere may still be instruction here, though we have worked out the\r\nlessons of common cases. I cannot, therefore, join in the full cry\r\nagainst anomalies; in my judgment it may quickly overrun the scent, and\r\nso miss what we should be glad to find.\r\n\r\nSubject to this saving remark, however, I not only admit, but maintain,\r\nthat our Constitution is full of curious oddities, which are impeding\r\nand mischievous, and ought to be struck out. Our law very often reminds\r\none of those outskirts of cities where you cannot for a long time tell\r\nhow the streets come to wind about in so capricious and serpent-like a\r\nmanner. At last it strikes you that they grew up, house by house, on\r\nthe devious tracks of the old green lanes; and if you follow on to the\r\nexisting fields, you may often find the change half complete. Just so\r\nthe lines of our Constitution were framed in old eras of sparse\r\npopulation, few wants, and simple habits; and we adhere in seeming to\r\ntheir shape, though civilisation has come with its dangers,\r\ncomplications, and enjoyments. These anomalies, in a hundred instances,\r\nmark the old boundaries of a constitutional struggle. The casual line\r\nwas traced according to the strength of deceased combatants; succeeding\r\ngenerations fought elsewhere; and the hesitating line of a half-drawn\r\nbattle was left to stand for a perpetual limit.\r\n\r\nI do not count as an anomaly the existence of our double government,\r\nwith all its infinite accidents, though half the superficial\r\npeculiarities that are often complained of arise out of it. The\r\nco-existence of a Queen's seeming prerogative and a Downing Street's\r\nreal government is just suited to such a country as this, in such an\r\nage as ours.[13]\r\n\r\n\r\n[13] So well is our real government concealed, that if you tell a\r\ncabman to drive to \"Downing Street,\" he most likely will never have\r\nheard of it, and will not in the least know where to take you. It is\r\nonly a \"disguised republic\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[The End]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The English Constitution, by Walter Bagehot",
