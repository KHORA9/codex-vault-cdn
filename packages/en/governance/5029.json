Hendricks, Vice-President of the\r\nUnited States. His distinguished public services, his complete integrity\r\nand devotion to every duty, and his personal virtues will find honorable\r\nrecord in his country's history.\r\n\r\nAmple and repeated proofs of the esteem and confidence in which he was held\r\nby his fellow-countrymen were manifested by his election to offices of the\r\nmost important trust and highest dignity; and at length, full of years and\r\nhonors, he has been laid at rest amid universal sorrow and benediction.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution, which requires those chosen to legislate for the people\r\nto annually meet in the discharge of their solemn trust, also requires the\r\nPresident to give to Congress information of the state of the Union and\r\nrecommend to their consideration such measures as he shall deem necessary\r\nand expedient. At the threshold of a compliance with these constitutional\r\ndirections it is well for us to bear in mind that our usefulness to the\r\npeople's interests will be promoted by a constant appreciation of the scope\r\nand character of our respective duties as they relate to Federal\r\nlegislation. While the Executive may recommend such measures as he shall\r\ndeem expedient, the responsibility for legislative action must and should\r\nrest upon those selected by the people to make their laws.\r\n\r\nContemplation of the grave and responsible functions assigned to the\r\nrespective branches of the Government under the Constitution will disclose\r\nthe partitions of power between our respective departments and their\r\nnecessary independence, and also the need for the exercise of all the power\r\nintrusted to each in that spirit of comity and cooperation which is\r\nessential to the proper fulfillment of the patriotic obligations which rest\r\nupon us as faithful servants of the people.\r\n\r\nThe jealous watchfulness of our constituencies, great and small,\r\nsupplements their suffrages, and before the tribunal they establish every\r\npublic servant should be judged.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to announce that the relations of the United States with\r\nall foreign powers continue to be friendly. Our position after nearly a\r\ncentury of successful constitutional government, maintenance of good faith\r\nin all our engagements, the avoidance of complications with other nations,\r\nand our consistent and amicable attitude toward the strong and weak alike\r\nfurnish proof of a political disposition which renders professions of good\r\nwill unnecessary. There are no questions of difficulty pending with any\r\nforeign government.\r\n\r\nThe Argentine Government has revived the long dormant question of the\r\nFalkland Islands by claiming from the United States indemnity for their\r\nloss, attributed to the action of the commander of the sloop of war\r\nLexington in breaking up a piratical colony on those islands in 1831, and\r\ntheir subsequent occupation by Great Britain. In view of the ample\r\njustification for the act of the Lexington and the derelict condition of\r\nthe islands before and after their alleged occupation by Argentine\r\ncolonists, this Government considers the claim as wholly groundless.\r\n\r\nQuestion has arisen with the Government of Austria-Hungary touching the\r\nrepresentation of the United States at Vienna. Having under my\r\nconstitutional prerogative appointed an estimable citizen of unimpeached\r\nprobity and competence as minister at that court, the Government of\r\nAustria-Hungary invited this Government to take cognizance of certain\r\nexceptions, based upon allegations against the personal acceptability of\r\nMr. Keiley, the appointed envoy, asking that in view thereof the\r\nappointment should be withdrawn. The reasons advanced were such as could\r\nnot be acquiesced in without violation of my oath of office and the\r\nprecepts of the Constitution, since they necessarily involved a limitation\r\nin favor of a foreign government upon the right of selection by the\r\nExecutive and required such an application of a religious test as a\r\nqualification for office under the United States as would have resulted in\r\nthe practical disfranchisement of a large class of our citizens and the\r\nabandonment of a vital principle in our Government. The Austro-Hungarian\r\nGovernment finally decided not to receive Mr. Keiley as the envoy of the\r\nUnited States, and that gentleman has since resigned his commission,\r\nleaving the post vacant. I have made no new nomination, and the interests\r\nof this Government at Vienna are now in the care of the secretary of\r\nlegation, acting as charge d'affaires ad interim.\r\n\r\nEarly in March last war broke out in Central America, caused by the attempt\r\nof Guatemala to consolidate the several States into a single government. In\r\nthese contests between our neighboring States the United States forebore to\r\ninterfere actively, but lent the aid of their friendly offices in\r\ndeprecation of war and to promote peace and concord among the belligerents,\r\nand by such counsel contributed importantly to the restoration of\r\ntranquillity in that locality.\r\n\r\nEmergencies growing out of civil war in the United States of Colombia\r\ndemanded of the Government at the beginning of this Administration the\r\nemployment of armed forces to fulfill its guaranties under the thirty-fifth\r\narticle of the treaty of 1846, in order to keep the transit open across the\r\nIsthmus of Panama. Desirous of exercising only the powers expressly\r\nreserved to us by the treaty, and mindful of the rights of Colombia, the\r\nforces sent to the Isthmus were instructed to confine their action to\r\n\"positively and efficaciously\" preventing the transit and its accessories\r\nfrom being \"interrupted or embarrassed.\"\r\n\r\nThe execution of this delicate and responsible task necessarily involved\r\npolice control where the local authority was temporarily powerless, but\r\nalways in aid of the sovereignty of Colombia.\r\n\r\nThe prompt and successful fulfillment of its duty by this Government was\r\nhighly appreciated by the Government of Colombia, and has been followed by\r\nexpressions of its satisfaction.\r\n\r\nHigh praise is due to the officers and men engaged in this service. The\r\nrestoration of peace on the Isthmus by the reestablishment of the\r\nconstituted Government there being thus accomplished, the forces of the\r\nUnited States were withdrawn.\r\n\r\nPending these occurrences a question of much importance was presented by\r\ndecrees of the Colombian Government proclaiming the closure of certain\r\nports then in the hands of insurgents and declaring vessels held by the\r\nrevolutionists to be piratical and liable to capture by any power. To\r\nneither of these propositions could the United States assent. An effective\r\nclosure of ports not in the possession of the Government, but held by\r\nhostile partisans, could not be recognized; neither could the vessels of\r\ninsurgents against the legitimate sovereignty be deemed hostes humani\r\ngeneris within the precepts of international law, whatever might be the\r\ndefinition and penalty of their acts under the municipal law of the State\r\nagainst whose authority they were in revolt. The denial by this Government\r\nof the Colombian propositions did not, however, imply the admission of a\r\nbelligerent status on the part of the insurgents.\r\n\r\nThe Colombian Government has expressed its willingness to negotiate\r\nconventions for the adjustment by arbitration of claims by foreign citizens\r\narising out of the destruction of the city of Aspinwall by the\r\ninsurrectionary forces.\r\n\r\nThe interest of the United States in a practicable transit for ships across\r\nthe strip of land separating the Atlantic from the Pacific has been\r\nrepeatedly manifested during the last half century.\r\n\r\nMy immediate predecessor caused to be negotiated with Nicaragua a treaty\r\nfor the construction, by and at the sole cost of the United States, of a\r\ncanal through Nicaraguan territory, and laid it before the Senate. Pending\r\nthe action of that body thereon, I withdrew the treaty for reexamination.\r\nAttentive consideration of its provisions leads me to withhold it from\r\nresubmission to the Senate.\r\n\r\nMaintaining, as I do, the tenets of a line of precedents from Washington's\r\nday, which proscribe entangling alliances with foreign states, I do not\r\nfavor a policy of acquisition of new and distant territory or the\r\nincorporation of remote interests with our own.\r\n\r\nThe laws of progress are vital and organic, and we must be conscious of\r\nthat irresistible tide of commercial expansion which, as the concomitant of\r\nour active civilization, day by day is being urged onward by those\r\nincreasing facilities of production, transportation, and communication to\r\nwhich steam and electricity have given birth; but our duty in the present\r\ninstructs us to address ourselves mainly to the development of the vast\r\nresources of the great area committed to our charge and to the cultivation\r\nof the arts of peace within our own borders, though jealously alert in\r\npreventing the American hemisphere from being involved in the political\r\nproblems and complications of distant governments. Therefore I am unable to\r\nrecommend propositions involving paramount privileges of ownership or\r\nright outside of our own territory, when coupled with absolute and\r\nunlimited engagements to defend the territorial integrity of the state\r\nwhere such interests lie. While the general project of connecting the two\r\noceans by means of a canal is to be encouraged, I am of opinion that any\r\nscheme to that end to be considered with favor should be free from the\r\nfeatures alluded to.\r\n\r\nThe Tehuantepec route is declared by engineers of the highest repute and by\r\ncompetent scientists to afford an entirely practicable transit for vessels\r\nand cargoes, by means of a ship railway, from the Atlantic to the Pacific.\r\nThe obvious advantages of such a route, if feasible, over others more\r\nremote from the axial lines of traffic between Europe and the pacific, and\r\nparticularly between the Valley of the Mississippi and the western coast of\r\nNorth and South America, are deserving of consideration.\r\n\r\nWhatever highway may be constructed across the barrier dividing the two\r\ngreatest maritime areas of the world must be for the world's benefit--a\r\ntrust for mankind, to be removed from the chance of domination by any\r\nsingle power, nor become a point of invitation for hostilities or a prize\r\nfor warlike ambition. An engagement combining the construction, ownership,\r\nand operation of such a work by this Government, with an offensive and\r\ndefensive alliance for its protection, with the foreign state whose\r\nresponsibilities and rights we would share is, in my judgment, inconsistent\r\nwith such dedication to universal and neutral use, and would, moreover,\r\nentail measures for its realization beyond the scope of our national polity\r\nor present means.\r\n\r\nThe lapse of years has abundantly confirmed the wisdom and foresight of\r\nthose earlier Administrations which, long before the conditions of maritime\r\nintercourse were changed and enlarged by the progress of the age,\r\nproclaimed the vital need of interoceanic transit across the American\r\nIsthmus and consecrated it in advance to the common use of mankind by their\r\npositive declarations and through the formal obligation of treaties. Toward\r\nsuch realization the efforts of my Administration will be applied, ever\r\nbearing in mind the principles on which it must rest, and which were\r\ndeclared in no uncertain tones by Mr. Cass, who, while Secretary of State,\r\nin 1858, announced that \"what the United States want in Central America,\r\nnext to the happiness of its people, is the security and neutrality of the\r\ninteroceanic routes which lead through it.\"\r\n\r\nThe construction of three transcontinental lines of railway, all in\r\nsuccessful operation, wholly within our territory, and uniting the Atlantic\r\nand the Pacific oceans, has been accompanied by results of a most\r\ninteresting and impressive nature, and has created new conditions, not in\r\nthe routes of commerce only, but in political geography, which powerfully\r\naffect our relations toward and necessarily increase our interests in any\r\ntransisthmian route which may be opened and employed for the ends of peace\r\nand traffic, or, in other contingencies, for uses inimical to both.\r\n\r\nTransportation is a factor in the cost of commodities scarcely second to\r\nthat of their production, and weighs as heavily upon the consumer.\r\n\r\nOur experience already has proven the great importance of having the\r\ncompetition between land carriage and water carriage fully developed, each\r\nacting as a protection to the public against the tendencies to monopoly\r\nwhich are inherent in the consolidation of wealth and power in the hands of\r\nvast corporations.\r\n\r\nThese suggestions may serve to emphasize what I have already said on the\r\nscore of the necessity of a neutralization of any interoceanic transit; and\r\nthis can only be accomplished by making the uses of the route open to all\r\nnations and subject to the ambitions and warlike necessities of none.\r\n\r\nThe drawings and report of a recent survey of the Nicaragua Canal route,\r\nmade by Chief Engineer Menocal, will be communicated for your information.\r\n\r\nThe claims of citizens of the United States for losses by reason of the\r\nlate military operations of Chile in Peru and Bolivia are the subject of\r\nnegotiation for a claims convention with Chile, providing for their\r\nsubmission to arbitration.\r\n\r\nThe harmony of our relations with China is fully sustained.\r\n\r\nIn the application of the acts lately passed to execute the treaty of 1880,\r\nrestrictive of the immigration of Chinese laborers into the United States,\r\nindividual cases of hardship have occurred beyond the power of the\r\nExecutive to remedy, and calling for judicial determination.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the Chinese question in the Western States and Territories\r\nis, despite this restrictive legislation, far from being satisfactory. The\r\nrecent outbreak in Wyoming Territory, where numbers of unoffending\r\nChinamen, indisputably within the protection of the treaties and the law,\r\nwere murdered by a mob, and the still more recent threatened outbreak of\r\nthe same character in Washington Territory, are fresh in the minds of all,\r\nand there is apprehension lest the bitterness of feeling against the\r\nMongolian race on the Pacific Slope may find vent in similar lawless\r\ndemonstrations. All the power of this Government should be exerted to\r\nmaintain the amplest good faith toward China in the treatment of these men,\r\nand the inflexible sternness of the law in bringing the wrongdoers to\r\njustice should be insisted upon.\r\n\r\nEvery effort has been made by this Government to prevent these violent\r\noutbreaks and to aid the representatives of China in their investigation of\r\nthese outrages; and it is but just to say that they are traceable to the\r\nlawlessness of men not citizens of the United States engaged in competition\r\nwith Chinese laborers.\r\n\r\nRace prejudice is the chief factor in originating these disturbances, and\r\nit exists in a large part of our domain, jeopardizing our domestic peace\r\nand the good relationship we strive to maintain with China.\r\n\r\nThe admitted right of a government to prevent the influx of elements\r\nhostile to its internal peace and security may not be questioned, even\r\nwhere there is no treaty stipulation on the subject. That the exclusion of\r\nChinese labor is demanded in other countries where like conditions prevail\r\nis strongly evidenced in the Dominion of Canada, where Chinese immigration\r\nis now regulated by laws more exclusive than our own. If existing laws are\r\ninadequate to compass the end in view, I shall be prepared to give earnest\r\nconsideration to any further remedial measures, within the treaty limits,\r\nwhich the wisdom of Congress may devise.\r\n\r\nThe independent State of the Kongo has been organized as a government under\r\nthe sovereignty of His Majesty the King of the Belgians, who assumes its\r\nchief magistracy in his personal character only, without making the new\r\nState a dependency of Belgium. It is fortunate that a benighted region,\r\nowing all it has of quickening civilization to the beneficence and\r\nphilanthropic spirit of this monarch, should have the advantage and\r\nsecurity of his benevolent supervision.\r\n\r\nThe action taken by this Government last year in being the first to\r\nrecognize the flag of the International Association of the Kongo has been\r\nfollowed by formal recognition of the new nationality which succeeds to its\r\nsovereign powers.\r\n\r\nA conference of delegates of the principal commercial nations was held at\r\nBerlin last winter to discuss methods whereby the Kongo basin might be kept\r\nopen to the world's trade. Delegates attended on behalf of the United\r\nStates on the understanding that their part should be merely deliberative,\r\nwithout imparting to the results any binding character so far as the United\r\nStates were concerned. This reserve was due to the indisposition of this\r\nGovernment to share in any disposal by an international congress of\r\njurisdictional questions in remote foreign territories. The results of the\r\nconference were embodied in a formal act of the nature of an international\r\nconvention, which laid down certain obligations purporting to be binding on\r\nthe signatories, subject to ratification within one year. Notwithstanding\r\nthe reservation under which the delegates of the United States attended,\r\ntheir signatures were attached to the general act in the same manner as\r\nthose of the plenipotentiaries of other governments, thus making the United\r\nStates appear, without reserve or qualification, as signatories to a joint\r\ninternational engagement imposing on the signers the conservation of the\r\nterritorial integrity of distant regions where we have no established\r\ninterests or control.\r\n\r\nThis Government does not, however, regard its reservation of liberty of\r\naction in the premises as at all impaired; and holding that an engagement\r\nto share in the obligation of enforcing neutrality in the remote valley of\r\nthe Kongo would be an alliance whose responsibilities we are not in a\r\nposition to assume, I abstain from asking the sanction of the Senate to\r\nthat general act.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence will be laid before you, and the instructive and\r\ninteresting report of the agent sent by this Government to the Kongo\r\ncountry and his recommendations for the establishment of commercial\r\nagencies on the African coast are also submitted for your consideration.\r\n\r\nThe commission appointed by my predecessor last winter to visit the Central\r\nand South American countries and report on the methods of enlarging the\r\ncommercial relations of the United States therewith has submitted reports,\r\nwhich will be laid before you.\r\n\r\nNo opportunity has been omitted to testify the friendliness of this\r\nGovernment toward Korea, whose entrance into the family of treaty powers\r\nthe United States were the first to recognize. I regard with favor the\r\napplication made by the Korean Government to be allowed to employ American\r\nofficers as military instructors, to which the assent of Congress becomes\r\nnecessary, and I am happy to say this request has the concurrent sanction\r\nof China and Japan.\r\n\r\nThe arrest and imprisonment of Julio R. Santos, a citizen of the United\r\nStates, by the authorities of Ecuador gave rise to a contention with that\r\nGovernment, in which his right to be released or to have a speedy and\r\nimpartial trial on announced charges and with all guaranties of defense\r\nstipulated by treaty was insisted upon by us. After an elaborate\r\ncorrespondence and repeated and earnest representations on our part Mr.\r\nSantos was, after an alleged trial and conviction, eventually included in a\r\ngeneral decree of amnesty and pardoned by the Ecuadorian Executive and\r\nreleased, leaving the question of his American citizenship denied by the\r\nEcuadorian Government, but insisted upon by our own.\r\n\r\nThe amount adjudged by the late French and American Claims Commission to be\r\ndue from the United States to French claimants on account of injuries\r\nsuffered by them during the War of Secession, having been appropriated by\r\nthe last Congress, has been duly paid to the French Government.\r\n\r\nThe act of February 25, 1885, provided for a preliminary search of the\r\nrecords of French prize courts for evidence bearing on the claims of\r\nAmerican citizens against France for spoliations committed prior to 1801.\r\nThe duty has been performed, and the report of the agent will be laid\r\nbefore you.\r\n\r\nI regret to say that the restrictions upon the importation of our pork into\r\nFrance continue, notwithstanding the abundant demonstration of the absence\r\nof sanitary danger in its use; but I entertain strong hopes that with a\r\nbetter understanding of the matter this vexatious prohibition will be\r\nremoved. It would be pleasing to be able to say as much with respect to\r\nGermany, Austria, and other countries, where such food products are\r\nabsolutely excluded, without present prospect of reasonable change.\r\n\r\nThe interpretation of our existing treaties of naturalization by Germany\r\nduring the past year has attracted attention by reason of an apparent\r\ntendency on the part of the Imperial Government to extend the scope of the\r\nresidential restrictions to which returning naturalized citizens of German\r\norigin are asserted to be liable under the laws of the Empire. The\r\ntemperate and just attitude taken by this Government with regard to this\r\nclass of questions will doubtless lead to a satisfactory understanding.\r\n\r\nThe dispute of Germany and Spain relative to the domination of the Caroline\r\nIslands has attracted the attention of this Government by reason of\r\nextensive interests of American citizens having grown up in those parts\r\nduring the past thirty years, and because the question of ownership\r\ninvolves jurisdiction of matters affecting the status of our citizens under\r\ncivil and criminal law. While standing wholly aloof from the proprietary\r\nissues raised between powers to both of which the United States are\r\nfriendly, this Government expects that nothing in the present contention\r\nshall unfavorably affect our citizens carrying on a peaceful commerce or\r\nthere domiciled, and has so informed the Governments of Spain and Germany.\r\n\r\nThe marked good will between the United States and Great Britain has been\r\nmaintained during the past year.\r\n\r\nThe termination of the fishing clauses of the treaty of Washington, in\r\npursuance of the joint resolution of March 3, 1883, must have resulted in\r\nthe abrupt cessation on the 1st of July of this year, in the midst of their\r\nventures, of the operations of citizens of the United States engaged in\r\nfishing in British American waters but for a diplomatic understanding\r\nreached with Her Majesty's Government in June last, whereby assurance was\r\nobtained that no interruption of those operations should take place during\r\nthe current fishing season.\r\n\r\nIn the interest of good neighborhood and of the commercial intercourse of\r\nadjacent communities, the question of the North American fisheries is one\r\nof much importance. Following out the intimation given by me when the\r\nextensory arrangement above described was negotiated, I recommend that the\r\nCongress provide for the appointment of a commission in which the\r\nGovernments of the United States and Great Britain shall be respectively\r\nrepresented, charged with the consideration and settlement, upon a just,\r\nequitable, and honorable basis, of the entire question of the fishing\r\nrights of the two Governments and their respective citizens on the coasts\r\nof the United States and British North America. The fishing interests being\r\nintimately related to other general questions dependent upon contiguity and\r\nintercourse, consideration thereof in all their equities might also\r\nproperly come within the purview of such a commission, and the fullest\r\nlatitude of expression on both sides should be permitted.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence in relation to the fishing rights will be submitted. The\r\narctic exploring steamer Alert, which was generously given by Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment to aid in the relief of the Greely expedition, was, after the\r\nsuccessful attainment of that humane purpose, returned to Great Britain, in\r\npursuance of the authority conferred by the act of March 3, 1885.\r\n\r\nThe inadequacy of the existing engagements for extradition between the\r\nUnited States and Great Britain has been long apparent. The tenth article\r\nof the treaty of 1842, one of the earliest compacts in this regard entered\r\ninto by us, stipulated for surrender in respect of a limited number of\r\noffenses. Other crimes no less inimical to the social welfare should be\r\nembraced and the procedure of extradition brought in harmony with present\r\ninternational practice. Negotiations with Her Majesty's Government for an\r\nenlarged treaty of extradition have been pending since 1870, and I\r\nentertain strong hopes that a satisfactory result may be soon attained.\r\n\r\nThe frontier line between Alaska and British Columbia, as defined by the\r\ntreaty of cession with Russia, follows the demarcation assigned in a prior\r\ntreaty between Great Britain and Russia. Modern exploration discloses that\r\nthis ancient boundary is impracticable as a geographical fact. In the\r\nunsettled condition of that region the question has lacked importance, but\r\nthe discovery of mineral wealth in the territory the line is supposed to\r\ntraverse admonishes that the time has come when an accurate knowledge of\r\nthe boundary is needful to avert jurisdictional complications. I recommend,\r\ntherefore, that provision be made for a preliminary reconnoissance by\r\nofficers of the United States, to the end of acquiring more precise\r\ninformation on the subject. I have invited Her Majesty's Government to\r\nconsider with us the adoption of a more convenient line, to be established\r\nby meridian observations or by known geographical features without the\r\nnecessity of an expensive survey of the whole.\r\n\r\nThe late insurrectionary movements in Hayti having been quelled, the\r\nGovernment of that Republic has made prompt provision for adjudicating the\r\nlosses suffered by foreigners because of hostilities there, and the claims\r\nof certain citizens of the United States will be in this manner\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\nThe long-pending claims of two citizens of the United States, Pelletier and\r\nLazare, have been disposed of by arbitration, and an award in favor of each\r\nclaimant has been made, which by the terms of the engagement is final. It\r\nremains for Congress to provide for the payment of the stipulated moiety of\r\nthe expenses.\r\n\r\nA question arose with Hayti during the past year by reason of the\r\nexceptional treatment of an American citizen, Mr. Van Bokkelen, a resident\r\nof Port-au-Prince, who, on suit by creditors residing in the United States,\r\nwas sentenced to imprisonment, and, under the operation of a Haytian\r\nstatute, was denied relief secured to a native Haytian. This Government\r\nasserted his treaty right to equal treatment with natives of Hayti in all\r\nsuits at law. Our contention was denied by the Haytian Government, which,\r\nhowever, while still professing to maintain the ground taken against Mr.\r\nVan Bokkelen's right, terminated the controversy by setting him at liberty\r\nwithout explanation.\r\n\r\nAn international conference to consider the means of arresting the spread\r\nof cholera and other epidemic diseases was held at Rome in May last, and\r\nadjourned to meet again on further notice. An expert delegate on behalf of\r\nthe United States has attended its sessions and will submit a report.\r\n\r\nOur relations with Mexico continue to be most cordial, as befits those of\r\nneighbors between whom the strongest ties of friendship and commercial\r\nintimacy exist, as the natural and growing consequence of our similarity of\r\ninstitutions and geographical propinquity.\r\n\r\nThe relocation of the boundary line between the United States and Mexico\r\nwestward of the Rio Grande, under the convention of July 29, 1882, has been\r\nunavoidably delayed, but I apprehend no difficulty in securing a\r\nprolongation of the period for its accomplishment.\r\n\r\nThe lately concluded commercial treaty with Mexico still awaits the\r\nstipulated legislation to carry its provisions into effect, for which one\r\nyear's additional time has been secured by a supplementary article signed\r\nin February last and since ratified on both sides.\r\n\r\nAs this convention, so important to the commercial welfare of the two\r\nadjoining countries, has been constitutionally confirmed by the treaty-\r\nmaking branch, I express the hope that legislation needed to make it\r\neffective may not be long delayed.\r\n\r\nThe large influx of capital and enterprise to Mexico from the United States\r\ncontinues to aid in the development of the resources and in augmenting the\r\nmaterial well-being of our sister Republic. Lines of railway, penetrating\r\nto the heart and capital of the country, bring the two peoples into\r\nmutually beneficial intercourse, and enlarged facilities of transit add to\r\nprofitable commerce, create new markets, and furnish avenues to otherwise\r\nisolated communities.\r\n\r\nI have already adverted to the suggested construction of a ship railway\r\nacross the narrow formation of the territory of Mexico at Tehuantepec.\r\n\r\nWith the gradual recovery of Peru from the effects of her late disastrous\r\nconflict with Chile, and with the restoration of civil authority in that\r\ndistracted country, it is hoped that pending war claims of our citizens\r\nwill be adjusted.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with notification given by the Government of Peru, the\r\nexisting treaties of commerce and extradition between the United States and\r\nthat country will terminate March 31, 1886.\r\n\r\nOur good relationship with Russia continues.\r\n\r\nAn officer of the Navy, detailed for the purpose, is now on his way to\r\nSiberia bearing the testimonials voted by Congress to those who generously\r\nsuccored the survivors of the unfortunate Jeannette expedition.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to advert to the cordiality of our intercourse with\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\nThe long-pending claim of the owners of the ship Masonic for loss suffered\r\nthrough the admitted dereliction of the Spanish authorities in the\r\nPhilippine Islands has been adjusted by arbitration and an indemnity\r\nawarded. The principle of arbitration in such cases, to which the United\r\nStates have long and consistently adhered, thus receives a fresh and\r\ngratifying confirmation.\r\n\r\nOther questions with Spain have been disposed of or are under diplomatic\r\nconsideration with a view to just and honorable settlement.\r\n\r\nThe operation of the commercial agreement with Spain of January 2--February\r\n13, 1884, has been found inadequate to the commercial needs of the United\r\nStates and the Spanish Antilies, and the terms of the agreement are\r\nsubjected to conflicting interpretations in those islands.\r\n\r\nNegotiations have been instituted at Madrid for a full treaty not open to\r\nthese objections and in the line of the general policy touching the\r\nneighborly intercourse of proximate communities, to which I elsewhere\r\nadvert, and aiming, moreover, at the removal of existing burdens and\r\nannoying restrictions; and although a satisfactory termination is promised,\r\nI am compelled to delay its announcement.\r\n\r\nAn international copyright conference was held at Berne in September, on\r\nthe invitation of the Swiss Government. The envoy of the United States\r\nattended as a delegate, but refrained from committing this Government to\r\nthe results, even by signing the recommendatory protocol adopted. The\r\ninteresting and important subject of international copyright has been\r\nbefore you for several years. Action is certainly desirable to effect the\r\nobject in view; and while there may be question as to the relative\r\nadvantage of treating it by legislation or by specific treaty, the matured\r\nviews of the Berne conference can not fail to aid your consideration of the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThe termination of the commercial treaty of 1862 between the United States\r\nand Turkey has been sought by that Government. While there is question as\r\nto the sufficiency of the notice of termination given, yet as the\r\ncommercial rights of our citizens in Turkey come under the favored-nation\r\nguaranties of the prior treaty of 1830, and as equal treatment is admitted\r\nby the Porte, no inconvenience can result from the assent of this\r\nGovernment to the revision of the Ottoman tariffs, in which the treaty\r\npowers have been invited to join.\r\n\r\nQuestions concerning our citizens in Turkey may be affected by the Porte's\r\nnonacquiescence in the right of expatriation and by the imposition of\r\nreligious tests as a condition of residence, in which this Government can\r\nnot concur. The United States must hold in their intercourse with every\r\npower that the status of their citizens is to be respected and equal civil\r\nprivileges accorded to them without regard to creed, and affected by no\r\nconsiderations save those growing out of domiciliary return to the land of\r\noriginal allegiance or of unfulfilled personal obligations which may\r\nsurvive, under municipal laws, after such voluntary return.\r\n\r\nThe negotiation with Venezuela relative to the rehearing of the awards of\r\nthe mixed commission constituted under the treaty of 1866 was resumed in\r\nview of the recent acquiescence of the Venezuelan envoy in the principal\r\npoint advanced by this Government, that the effects of the old treaty could\r\nonly be set aside by the operation of a new convention. A result in\r\nsubstantial accord with the advisory suggestions contained in the joint\r\nresolution of March 3, 1883, has been agreed upon and will shortly be\r\nsubmitted to the Senate for ratification.\r\n\r\nUnder section 3659 of the Revised Statutes all funds held in trust by the\r\nUnited States and the annual interest accruing thereon, when not otherwise\r\nrequired by treaty, are to be invested in stocks of the United States\r\nbearing a rate of interest not less than 5 per cent per annum. There being\r\nnow no procurable stocks paying so high a rate of interest, the letter of\r\nthe statute is at present inapplicable, but its spirit is subserved by\r\ncontinuing to make investments of this nature in current stocks bearing the\r\nhighest interest now paid. The statute, however, makes no provision for the\r\ndisposal of such accretions. It being contrary to the general rule of this\r\nGovernment to allow interest on claims, I recommend the repeal of the\r\nprovision in question and the disposition, under a uniform rule, of the\r\npresent accumulations from investment of trust funds.\r\n\r\nThe inadequacy of existing legislation touching citizenship and\r\nnaturalization demands your consideration.\r\n\r\nWhile recognizing the right of expatriation, no statutory provision exists\r\nproviding means for renouncing citizenship by an American citizen, native\r\nborn or naturalized, nor for terminating and vacating an improper\r\nacquisition of citizenship. Even a fraudulent decree of naturalization can\r\nnot now be canceled. The privilege and franchise of American citizenship\r\nshould be granted with care, and extended to those only who intend in good\r\nfaith to assume its duties and responsibilities when attaining its\r\nprivileges and benefits. It should be withheld from those who merely go\r\nthrough the forms of naturalization with the intent of escaping the duties\r\nof their original allegiance without taking upon themselves those of their\r\nnew status, or who may acquire the rights of American citizenship for no\r\nother than a hostile purpose toward their original governments. These evils\r\nhave had many flagrant illustrations.\r\n\r\nI regard with favor the suggestion put forth by one of my predecessors that\r\nprovision be made for a central bureau of record of the decrees of\r\nnaturalization granted by the various courts throughout the United States\r\nnow invested with that power.\r\n\r\nThe rights which spring from domicile in the United States, especially when\r\ncoupled with a declaration of intention to become a citizen, are worthy of\r\ndefinition by statute. The stranger coming hither with intent to remain,\r\nestablishing his residence in our midst, contributing to the general\r\nwelfare, and by his voluntary act declaring his purpose to assume the\r\nresponsibilities of citizenship, thereby gains an inchoate status which\r\nlegislation may properly define. The laws of certain States and Territories\r\nadmit a domiciled alien to the local franchise, conferring on him the\r\nrights of citizenship to a degree which places him in the anomalous\r\nposition of being a citizen of a State and yet not of the United States\r\nwithin the purview of Federal and international law.\r\n\r\nIt is important within the scope of national legislation to define this\r\nright of alien domicile as distinguished from Federal naturalization.\r\n\r\nThe commercial relations of the United States with their immediate\r\nneighbors and with important areas of traffic near our shores suggest\r\nespecially liberal intercourse between them and us.\r\n\r\nFollowing the treaty of 1883 with Mexico, which rested on the basis of a\r\nreciprocal exemption from customs duties, other similar treaties were\r\ninitiated by my predecessor.\r\n\r\nRecognizing the need of less obstructed traffic with Cuba and Puerto Rico,\r\nand met by the desire of Spain to succor languishing interests in the\r\nAntilles, steps were taken to attain those ends by a treaty of commerce. A\r\nsimilar treaty was afterwards signed by the Dominican Republic.\r\nSubsequently overtures were made by Her Britannic Majesty's Government for\r\na like mutual extension of commercial intercourse with the British West\r\nIndian and South American dependencies, but without result.\r\n\r\nOn taking office I withdrew for reexamination the treaties signed with\r\nSpain and Santo Domingo, then pending before the Senate. The result has\r\nbeen to satisfy me of the inexpediency of entering into engagements of this\r\ncharacter not covering the entire traffic.\r\n\r\nThese treaties contemplated the surrender by the United States of large\r\nrevenues for inadequate considerations. Upon sugar alone duties were\r\nsurrendered to an amount far exceeding all the advantages offered in\r\nexchange. Even were it intended to relieve our consumers, it was evident\r\nthat so long as the exemption but partially covered our importation such\r\nrelief would be illusory. To relinquish a revenue so essential seemed\r\nhighly improvident at a time when new and large drains upon the Treasury\r\nwere contemplated. Moreover, embarrassing questions would have arisen under\r\nthe favored-nation clauses of treaties with other nations.\r\n\r\nAs a further objection, it is evident that tariff regulation by treaty\r\ndiminishes that independent control over its own revenues which is\r\nessential for the safety and welfare of any government. Emergency calling\r\nfor an increase of taxation may at any time arise, and no engagement with a\r\nforeign power should exist to hamper the action of the Government.\r\n\r\nBy the fourteenth section of the shipping act approved June 26, 1884,\r\ncertain reductions and contingent exemptions from tonnage dues were made as\r\nto vessels entering ports of the United States from any foreign port in\r\nNorth and Central America, the West India Islands, the Bahamas and\r\nBermudas, Mexico, and the Isthmus as far as Aspinwall and Panama. The\r\nGovernments of Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Portugal, and Sweden and Norway\r\nhave asserted, under the favored-nation clause in their treaties with the\r\nUnited States, a claim to like treatment in respect of vessels coming to\r\nthe United States from their home ports. This Government, however, holds\r\nthat the privileges granted by the act are purely geographical, inuring to\r\nany vessel of any foreign power that may choose to engage in traffic\r\nbetween this country and any port within the defined zone, and no warrant\r\nexists under the most-favored-nation clause for the extension of the\r\nprivileges in question to vessels sailing to this country from ports\r\noutside the limitation of the act.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the relations of commerce with our near neighbors, whose\r\nterritories form so long a frontier line difficult to be guarded, and who\r\nfind in our country, and equally offer to us, natural markets, demand\r\nspecial and considerate treatment. It rests with Congress to consider what\r\nlegislative action may increase facilities of intercourse which contiguity\r\nmakes natural and desirable.\r\n\r\nI earnestly urge that Congress recast the appropriations for the\r\nmaintenance of the diplomatic and consular service on a footing\r\ncommensurate with the importance of our national interests. At every post\r\nwhere a representative is necessary the salary should be so graded as to\r\npermit him to live with comfort. With the assignment of adequate salaries\r\nthe so-called notarial extra official fees, which our officers abroad are\r\nnow permitted to treat as personal perquisites, should be done away with.\r\nEvery act requiring the certification and seal of the officer should be\r\ntaxable at schedule rates and the fee therefor returned to the Treasury. By\r\nrestoring these revenues to the public use the consular service would be\r\nself-supporting, even with a liberal increase of the present low salaries.\r\n\r\nIn further prevention of abuses a system of consular inspection should be\r\ninstituted.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of a limited number of secretaries of legation at large, to\r\nbe assigned to duty wherever necessary, and in particular for temporary\r\nservice at missions which for any cause may be without a head, should also\r\nbe authorized.\r\n\r\nI favor also authorization for the detail of officers of the regular\r\nservice as military or naval attaches at legations.\r\n\r\nSome foreign governments do not recognize the union of consular with\r\ndiplomatic functions. Italy and Venezuela will only receive the appointee\r\nin one of his two capacities, but this does not prevent the requirement of\r\na bond and submission to the responsibilities of an office whose duties he\r\ncan not discharge. The superadded title of consul-general should be\r\nabandoned at all missions.\r\n\r\nI deem it expedient that a well-devised measure for the reorganization of\r\nthe extraterritorial courts in Oriental countries should replace the\r\npresent system, which labors under the disadvantage of combining judicial\r\nand executive functions in the same office.\r\n\r\nIn several Oriental countries generous offers have been made of premises\r\nfor housing the legations of the United States. A grant of land for that\r\npurpose was made some years since by Japan, and has been referred to in the\r\nannual messages of my predecessor. The Siamese Government has made a gift\r\nto the United States of commodious quarters in Bangkok. In Korea the late\r\nminister was permitted to purchase a building from the Government for\r\nlegation use. In China the premises rented for the legation are favored as\r\nto local charges. At Tangier the house occupied by our representative has\r\nbeen for many years the property; this Government, having been given for\r\nthat purpose in 1822 by the Sultan of Morocco. I approve the suggestion\r\nheretofore made, that, view of the conditions of life and administration in\r\nthe Eastern countries, the legation buildings in China, Japan, Korea, Siam,\r\nand perhaps Persia, should be owned and furnished by the Government with a\r\nview to permanency and security. To this end I recommend that authority be\r\ngiven to accept the gifts adverted to in Japan and Siam, and to purchase in\r\nthe other countries named, with provision for furniture and repairs. A\r\nconsiderable saving in rentals would result.\r\n\r\nThe World's Industrial Exposition, held at New Orleans last winter, with\r\nthe assistance of the Federal Government, attracted a large number of\r\nforeign exhibits, and proved of great value in spreading among the\r\nconcourse of visitors from Mexico and Central and South America a wider\r\nknowledge of the varied manufactures and productions of this country and\r\ntheir availability in exchange for the productions of those regions.\r\n\r\nPast Congresses have had under consideration the advisability of abolishing\r\nthe discrimination made by the tariff laws in favor of the works of\r\nAmerican artists. The odium of the policy which subjects to a high rate of\r\nduty the paintings of foreign artists and exempts the productions of\r\nAmerican artists residing abroad, and who receive gratuitously advantages\r\nand instruction, is visited upon our citizens engaged in art culture in\r\nEurope, and has caused them with practical unanimity to favor the abolition\r\nof such an ungracious distinction; and in their interest, and for other\r\nobvious reasons, I strongly recommend it.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Treasury fully exhibits the condition of\r\nthe public finances and of the several branches of the Government connected\r\nwith his Department. The suggestions of the Secretary relating to the\r\npractical operations of this important Department, and his recommendations\r\nin the direction of simplification and economy, particularly in the work of\r\ncollecting customs duties, are especially urged upon the attention of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary receipts from all sources for the fiscal year ended June 30,\r\n1885, were $322,690,706.38. Of this sum $181,471,939.34 was received from\r\ncustoms and $112,498,725.54 from internal revenue. The total receipts, as\r\ngiven above, were $24,829,163.54 less than those for the year ended June\r\n30, 1884. This diminution embraces a falling off of $13,595,550.42 in the\r\nreceipts from customs and $9,687,346.97 in the receipts from internal\r\nrevenue.\r\n\r\nThe total ordinary expenditures of the Government for the fiscal year were\r\n$260,226,935.50, leaving a surplus in the Treasury at the close of the year\r\nof $63,463,771.27. This is $40,929,854.32 less than the surplus reported at\r\nthe close of the previous year.\r\n\r\nThe expenditures are classified as follows:\r\n\r\nThe amount paid on the public debt during the fiscal year ended June 30,\r\n1885, was $45,993,235.43, and there has been paid since that date and up to\r\nNovember 1, 1885, the sum of $369,828, leaving the amount of the debt at\r\nthe last-named date $1,514,475,860.47. There was however, at that time in\r\nthe Treasury, applicable to the general purposes of the Government, the sum\r\nof $66,818,292.38.\r\n\r\nThe total receipts for the current fiscal year ending June 30, 1886,\r\nascertained to October 1, 1885, and estimated for the remainder of the\r\nyear, are $315,000,000. The expenditures ascertained and estimated for the\r\nsame time are $245,000,000, leaving a surplus at the close of the year\r\nestimated at $70,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe value of the exports from the United States to foreign countries during\r\nthe last fiscal year was as follows:\r\n\r\nSome of the principal exports, with their values and the percentage they\r\nrespectively bear to the total exportation, are given as follows:\r\n\r\nOur imports during the year were as follows:\r\n\r\nThe following are given as prominent articles of import during the year,\r\nwith their values and the percentage they bear to the total importation:\r\n\r\nOf the entire amount of duties collected 70 per cent was collected from the\r\nfollowing articles of import:\r\n\r\nThe fact that our revenues are in excess of the actual needs of all\r\neconomical administration of the Government justifies a reduction in the\r\namount exacted from the people for its support. Our Government is but the\r\nmeans established by the will of a free people by which certain principles\r\nare applied which they have adopted for their benefit and protection; and\r\nit is never better administered and its true spirit is never better\r\nobserved than when the people's taxation for its support is scrupulously\r\nlimited to the actual necessity of expenditure and distributed according to\r\na just and equitable plan.\r\n\r\nThe proposition with which we have to deal is the reduction of the revenue\r\nreceived by the Government, and indirectly paid by the people, from customs\r\nduties. The question of free trade is not involved, nor is there now any\r\noccasion for the general discussion of the wisdom or expediency of a\r\nprotective system.\r\n\r\nJustice and fairness dictate that in any modification of our present laws\r\nrelating to revenue the industries and interests which have been encouraged\r\nby such laws, and in which our citizens have large investments, should not\r\nbe ruthlessly injured or destroyed. We should also deal with the subject in\r\nsuch manner as to protect the interests of American labor, which is the\r\ncapital of our workingmen. Its stability and proper remuneration furnish\r\nthe most justifiable pretext for a protective policy.\r\n\r\nWithin these limitations a certain reduction should be made in our customs\r\nrevenue. The amount of such reduction having been determined, the inquiry\r\nfollows, Where can it best be remitted and what articles can best be\r\nreleased from duty in the interest of our citizens?\r\n\r\nI think the reduction should be made in the revenue derived from a tax upon\r\nthe imported necessaries of life. We thus directly lessen the cost of\r\nliving in every family of the land and release to the people in every\r\nhumble home a larger measure of the rewards of frugal industry.\r\n\r\nDuring the year ended November 1, 1885, 145 national banks were organized,\r\nwith an aggregate capital of $16,938,000, and circulating notes have been\r\nissued to them amounting to $4,274,910. The whole number of these banks in\r\nexistence on the day above mentioned was 2,727.\r\n\r\nThe very limited amount of circulating notes issued by our national banks,\r\ncompared with the amount the law permits them to issue upon a deposit of\r\nbonds for their redemption, indicates that the volume of our circulating\r\nmedium may be largely increased through this instrumentality.\r\n\r\nNothing more important than the present condition of our currency and\r\ncoinage can claim your attention.\r\n\r\nSince February, 1878, the Government has, under the compulsory provisions\r\nof law, purchased silver bullion and coined the same at the rate of more\r\nthan $2,000,000 every month. By this process up to the present date\r\n215,759,431 silver dollars have been coined.\r\n\r\nA reasonable appreciation of a delegation of power to the General\r\nGovernment would limit its exercise, without express restrictive words, to\r\nthe people's needs and the requirements of the public welfare.\r\n\r\nUpon this theory the authority to \"coin money\" given to Congress by the\r\nConstitution, if it permits the purchase by the Government of bullion for\r\ncoinage in any event, does not justify such purchase and coinage to an\r\nextent beyond the amount needed for a sufficient circulating medium.\r\n\r\nThe desire to utilize the silver product of the country should not lead to\r\na misuse or the perversion of this power.\r\n\r\nThe necessity for such an addition to the silver currency of the nation as\r\nis compelled by the silver-coinage act is negatived by the fact that up to\r\nthe present time only about 50,000,000 of the silver dollars so coined have\r\nactually found their way into circulation, leaving more than 165,000,000 in\r\nthe possession of the Government, the custody of which has entailed a\r\nconsiderable expense for the construction of vaults for it deposit. Against\r\nthis latter amount there are outstanding silver certificates amounting to\r\nabout $93,000,000.\r\n\r\nEvery month two millions of gold in the public Treasury are paid our for\r\ntwo millions or more of silver dollars, to be added to the idle mass\r\nalready accumulated.\r\n\r\nIf continued long enough, this operation will result in the substitution of\r\nsilver for all the gold the Government owns applicable to its general\r\npurposes. It will not do to rely upon the customs receipts of the\r\nGovernment to make good this drain of gold, because the silver thus coined\r\nhaving been made legal tender for all debts and dues, public and private,\r\nat times during the last six months 58 per cent of the receipts for duties\r\nhas been in silver or silver certificates, while the average within that\r\nperiod has been 20 per cent. The proportion of silver and its certificates\r\nreceived by the Government will probably increase as time goes on, for the\r\nreason that the nearer the period approaches when it will be obliged to\r\noffer silver in payment of its obligations the greater inducement there\r\nwill be to hoard gold against depreciation in the value of silver or for\r\nthe purpose of speculating.\r\n\r\nThis hoarding of gold has already begun.\r\n\r\nWhen the time comes that gold has been withdrawn from circulation, then\r\nwill be apparent the difference between the real value of the silver dollar\r\nand a dollar in gold, and the two coins will part company. Gold, still the\r\nstandard of value and necessary in our dealings with other countries, will\r\nbe at a premium over silver; banks which have substituted gold for the\r\ndeposits of their customers may pay them with silver bought with such gold,\r\nthus making a handsome profit; rich speculators will sell their hoarded\r\ngold to their neighbors who need it to liquidate their foreign debts, at a\r\nruinous premium over silver, and the laboring men and women of the land,\r\nmost defenseless of all, will find that the dollar received for the wage of\r\ntheir toil has sadly shrunk in its purchasing power. It may be said that\r\nthe latter result will be but temporary, and that ultimately the price of\r\nlabor will be adjusted to the change; but even if this takes place the\r\nwage-worker can not possibly gain, but must inevitably lose, since the\r\nprice he is compelled to pay for his living will not only be measured in a\r\ncoin heavily depreciated and fluctuating and uncertain in its value, but\r\nthis uncertainty in the value of the purchasing medium will be made the\r\npretext for an advance in prices beyond that justified by actual\r\ndepreciation.\r\n\r\nThe words uttered in 1834 by Daniel Webster in the Senate of the United\r\nStates are true to-day: The very man of all others who has the deepest\r\ninterest in a sound currency, and who suffers most by mischievous\r\nlegislation in money matters, is the man who earns his daily bread by his\r\ndaily toil. The most distinguished advocate of bimetallism, discussing our\r\nsilver coinage, has lately written: No American citizen's hand has yet felt\r\nthe sensation of cheapness, either in receiving or expending the silver-act\r\ndollars. And those who live by labor or legitimate trade never will feel\r\nthat sensation of cheapness. However plenty silver dollars may become, they\r\nwill not be distributed as gifts among the people; and if the laboring man\r\nshould receive four depreciated dollars where he now receives but two, he\r\nwill pay in the depreciated coin more than double the price he now pays for\r\nall the necessaries and comforts of life.\r\n\r\nThose who do not fear any disastrous consequences arising from the\r\ncontinued compulsory coinage of silver as now directed by law, and who\r\nsuppose that the addition to the currency of the country intended as its\r\nresult will be a public benefit, are reminded that history demonstrates\r\nthat the point is easily reached in the attempt to float at the same time\r\ntwo sorts of money of different excellence when the better will cease to be\r\nin general circulation. The hoarding of gold which has already taken place\r\nindicates that we shall not escape the usual experience in such cases. So\r\nif this silver coinage be continued we may reasonably expect that gold and\r\nits equivalent will abandon the field of circulation to silver alone. This\r\nof course must produce a severe contraction of our circulating medium,\r\ninstead of adding to it.\r\n\r\nIt will not be disputed that any attempt on the part of the Government to\r\ncause the circulation of silver dollars worth 80 cents side by side with\r\ngold dollars worth 100 cents, even within the limit that legislation does\r\nnot run counter to the laws of trade, to be successful must be seconded by\r\nthe confidence of the people that both coins will retain the same\r\npurchasing power and be interchangeable at will. A special effort has been\r\nmade by the Secretary of the Treasury to increase the amount of our silver\r\ncoin in circulation; but the fact that a large share of the limited amount\r\nthus put out has soon returned to the public Treasury in payment of duties\r\nleads to the belief that the people do not now desire to keep it in hand,\r\nand this, with the evident disposition to hoard gold, gives rise to the\r\nsuspicion that there already exists a lack of confidence among the people\r\ntouching our financial processes. There is certainly not enough silver now\r\nin circulation to cause uneasiness, and the whole amount coined and now on\r\nhand might after a time be absorbed by the people without apprehension; but\r\nit is the ceaseless stream that threatens to overflow the land which causes\r\nfear and uncertainty.\r\n\r\nWhat has been thus far submitted upon this subject relates almost entirely\r\nto considerations of a home nature, unconnected with the bearing which the\r\npolicies of other nations have upon the question. But it is perfectly\r\napparent that a line of action in regard to our currency can not wisely be\r\nsettled upon or persisted in without considering the attitude on the\r\nsubject of other countries with whom we maintain intercourse through\r\ncommerce, trade, and travel. An acknowledgment of this fact is found in the\r\nact by virtue of which our silver is compulsorily coined. It provides\r\nthat--The President shall invite the governments of the countries\r\ncomposing the Latin Union, so called, and of such other European nations as\r\nhe may deem advisable, to join the United States in a conference to adopt a\r\ncommon ratio between gold and silver for the purpose of establishing\r\ninternationally the use of bimetallic money and securing fixity of relative\r\nvalue between those metals. This conference absolutely failed, and a\r\nsimilar fate has awaited all subsequent efforts in the same direction. And\r\nstill we continue our coinage of silver at a ratio different from that of\r\nany other nation. The most vital part of the silver-coinage act remains\r\ninoperative and unexecuted, and without an ally or friend we battle upon\r\nthe silver field in an illogical and losing contest.\r\n\r\nTo give full effect to the design of Congress on this subject I have made\r\ncareful and earnest endeavor since the adjournment of the last Congress.\r\n\r\nTo this end I delegated a gentleman well instructed in fiscal science to\r\nproceed to the financial centers of Europe and, in conjunction with our\r\nministers to England, France, and Germany, to obtain a full knowledge of\r\nthe attitude and intent of those governments in respect of the\r\nestablishment of such an international ratio as would procure free coinage\r\nof both metals at the mints of those countries and our own. By my direction\r\nour consul-general at Paris has given close attention to the proceedings of\r\nthe congress of the Latin Union, in order to indicate our interest in its\r\nobjects and report its action.\r\n\r\nIt may be said in brief, as the result of these efforts, that the attitude\r\nof the leading powers remains substantially unchanged since the monetary\r\nconference of 1881, nor is it to be questioned that the views of these\r\ngovernments are in each instance supported by the weight of public\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nThe steps thus taken have therefore only more fully demonstrated the\r\nuselessness of further attempts at present to arrive at any agreement on\r\nthe subject with other nations.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime we are accumulating silver coin, based upon our own\r\npeculiar ratio, to such an extent, and assuming so heavy a burden to be\r\nprovided for in any international negotiations, as will render us an\r\nundesirable party to any future monetary conference of nations.\r\n\r\nIt is a significant fact that four of the five countries composing the\r\nLatin Union mentioned in our coinage act, embarrassed with their silver\r\ncurrency, have just completed an agreement among themselves that no more\r\nsilver shall be coined by their respective Governments and that such as has\r\nbeen already coined and in circulation shall be redeemed in gold by the\r\ncountry of its coinage. The resort to this expedient by these countries may\r\nwell arrest the attention of those who suppose that we can succeed without\r\nshock or injury in the attempt to circulate upon its merits all the silver\r\nwe may coin under the provisions of our silver-coinage act.\r\n\r\nThe condition in which our Treasury may be placed by a persistence in our\r\npresent course is a matter of concern to every patriotic citizen who does\r\nnot desire his Government to pay in silver such of its obligations as\r\nshould be paid in gold. Nor should our condition be such as to oblige us,\r\nin a prudent management of our affairs, to discontinue the calling in and\r\npayment of interest-bearing obligations which we have the right now to\r\ndischarge, and thus avoid the payment of further interest thereon.\r\n\r\nThe so-called debtor class, for whose benefit the continued compulsory\r\ncoinage of silver is insisted upon, are not dishonest because they are in\r\ndebt, and they should not be suspected of a desire to jeopardize the\r\nfinancial safety of the country in order that they may cancel their present\r\ndebts by paying the same in depreciated dollars. Nor should it be forgotten\r\nthat it is not the rich nor the money lender alone that must submit to such\r\na readjustment, enforced by the Government and their debtors. The pittance\r\nof the widow and the orphan and the incomes of helpless beneficiaries of\r\nall kinds would be disastrously reduced. The depositors in savings banks\r\nand in other institutions which hold in trust the savings of the poor, when\r\ntheir little accumulations are scaled down to meet the new order of things,\r\nwould in their distress painfully realize the delusion of the promise made\r\nto them that plentiful money would improve their condition.\r\n\r\nWe have now on hand all the silver dollars necessary to supply the present\r\nneeds of the people and to satisfy those who from sentiment wish to see\r\nthem in circulation, and if their coinage is suspended they can be readily\r\nobtained by all who desire them. If the need of more is at anytime\r\napparent, their coinage may be renewed.\r\n\r\nThat disaster has not already overtaken us furnishes no proof that danger\r\ndoes not wait upon a continuation of the present silver coinage. We have\r\nbeen saved by the most careful management and unusual expedients, by a\r\ncombination of fortunate conditions, and by a confident expectation that\r\nthe course of the Government in regard to silver coinage would be speedily\r\nchanged by the action of Congress.\r\n\r\nProsperity hesitates upon our threshold because of the dangers and\r\nuncertainties surrounding this question. Capital timidly shrinks from\r\ntrade, and investors are unwilling to take the chance of the questionable\r\nshape in which their money will be returned to them, while enterprise halts\r\nat a risk against which care and sagacious management do not protect.\r\n\r\nAs a necessary consequence, labor lacks employment and suffering and\r\ndistress are visited upon a portion of our fellow-citizens especially\r\nentitled to the careful consideration of those charged with the duties of\r\nlegislation. No interest appeals to us so strongly for a safe and stable\r\ncurrency as the vast army of the unemployed.\r\n\r\nI recommend the suspension of the compulsory coinage of silver dollars,\r\ndirected by the law passed in February, 1878.\r\n\r\nThe Steamboat-Inspection Service on the 30th day of June, 1885, was\r\ncomposed of 140 persons, including officers, clerks, and messengers. The\r\nexpenses of the service over the receipts were $138,822.22 during the\r\nfiscal year. The special inspection of foreign steam vessels, organized\r\nunder a law passed in 1882, was maintained during the year at an expense of\r\n$36,641.63. Since the close of the fiscal year reductions have been made in\r\nthe force employed which will result in a saving during the current year of\r\n$17,000 without affecting the efficiency of the service.\r\n\r\nThe Supervising Surgeon-General reports that during the fiscal year 41,714\r\npatients have received relief through the Marine-Hospital Service, of whom\r\n12,803 were treated in hospitals and 28,911 at the dispensaries.\r\n\r\nActive and effective efforts have been made through the medium of this\r\nservice to protect the country against an invasion of cholera, which has\r\nprevailed in Spain and France, and the smallpox, which recently broke out\r\nin Canada.\r\n\r\nThe most gratifying results have attended the operations of the Life Saving\r\nService during the last fiscal year. The observance of the provision of law\r\nrequiring the appointment of the force employed in this service to be made\r\n\"solely with reference to their fitness, and without reference to their\r\npolitical or party affiliation,\" has secured the result which may\r\nconfidently be expected in any branch of public employment where such a\r\nrule is applied. As a consequence, this service is composed of men well\r\nqualified for the performance of their dangerous and exceptionally\r\nimportant duties.\r\n\r\nThe number of stations in commission at the close of the year was 203. The\r\nnumber of disasters to vessels and craft of all kinds within their field of\r\naction was 371. The number of persons endangered in such disasters was\r\n2,439, of whom 2,428 were saved and only 11 lost. Other lives which were\r\nimperiled, though not by disasters to shipping, were also rescued, and a\r\nlarge amount of property was saved through the aid of this service. The\r\ncost of its maintenance during the year was $828,474.43.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Coast and Geodetic Survey was during the last fiscal year\r\ncarried on within the boundaries and off the coasts of thirty-two States,\r\ntwo Territories, and the District of Columbia. In July last certain\r\nirregularities were found to exist in the management of this Bureau, which\r\nled to a prompt investigation of its methods. The abuses which were brought\r\nto light by this examination and the reckless disregard of duty and the\r\ninterests of the Government developed on the part of some of those\r\nconnected with the service made a change of superintendency and a few of\r\nits other officers necessary. Since the Bureau has been in new hands an\r\nintroduction of economies and the application of business methods have\r\nproduced an important saving to the Government and a promise of more useful\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nThis service has never been regulated by anything but the most indefinite\r\nlegal enactments and the most unsatisfactory rules. It was many years ago\r\nsanctioned apparently for a purpose regarded as temporary and related to a\r\nsurvey of our coast. Having gained a place in the appropriations made by\r\nCongress, it has gradually taken to itself powers and objects not\r\ncontemplated in its creation and extended its operations until it sadly\r\nneeds legislative attention.\r\n\r\nSo far as a further survey of our coast is concerned, there seems to be a\r\npropriety in transferring that work to the Navy Department. The other\r\nduties now in charge of this establishment, if they can not be profitably\r\nattached to some existing Department or other bureau, should be prosecuted\r\nunder a law exactly defining their scope and purpose, and with a careful\r\ndiscrimination between the scientific inquiries which may properly be\r\nassumed by the Government and those which should be undertaken by State\r\nauthority or by individual enterprise.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that the report of the Congressional committee heretofore\r\nappointed to investigate this and other like matters will aid in the\r\naccomplishment of proper legislation on this subject.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War is herewith submitted. The attention of\r\nCongress is invited to the detailed account which it contains of the\r\nadministration of his Department, and his recommendations and suggestions\r\nfor the improvement of the service.\r\n\r\nThe Army consisted, at the date of the last consolidated returns, of 2,154\r\nofficers and 24,705 enlisted men.\r\n\r\nThe expenses of the Departments for the fiscal year ended June, 30, 1885,\r\nincluding $13,164,394.60 for public works and river and harbor\r\nimprovements, were $45,850,999.54.\r\n\r\nBesides the troops which were dispatched in pursuit of the small band of\r\nIndians who left their reservation in Arizona and committed murders and\r\noutrages, two regiments of cavalry and one of infantry were sent last July\r\nto the Indian Territory to prevent an outbreak which seemed imminent. They\r\nremained to aid, if necessary, in the expulsion of intruders upon the\r\nreservation, who seemed to have caused the discontent among the Indians,\r\nbut the Executive proclamation warning them to remove was complied with\r\nwithout their interference.\r\n\r\nTroops were also sent to Rock Springs, in Wyoming Territory, after the\r\nmassacre of Chinese there, to prevent further disturbance, and afterwards\r\nto Seattle, in Washington Territory, to avert a threatened attack upon\r\nChinese laborers and domestic violence there. In both cases the mere\r\npresence of the troops had the desired effect.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the number of desertions has diminished, but that during\r\nthe last fiscal year they numbered 2,927; and one instance is given by the\r\nLieutenant-General of six desertions by the same recruit. I am convinced\r\nthat this number of desertions can be much diminished by better discipline\r\nand treatment; but the punishment should be increased for repeated\r\noffenses.\r\n\r\nThese desertions might also be reduced by lessening the term of first\r\nenlistments, thus allowing a discontented recruit to contemplate a nearer\r\ndischarge and the Army a profitable riddance. After one term of service a\r\nreenlistment would be quite apt to secure a contented recruit and a good\r\nsoldier.\r\n\r\nThe Acting Judge-Advocate-General reports that the number of trials by\r\ngeneral courts-martial during the year was 2,328, and that 11,851 trials\r\ntook place before garrison and regimental courts-martial. The suggestion\r\nthat probably more than half the Army have been tried for offenses, great\r\nand small, in one year may well arrest attention. Of course many of these\r\ntrials before garrison and regimental courts-martial were for offenses\r\nalmost frivolous, and there should, I think, be a way devised to dispose of\r\nthese in a more summary and less inconvenient manner than by\r\ncourt-martial.\r\n\r\nIf some of the proceedings of courts-martial which I have had occasion to\r\nexamine present the ideas of justice which generally prevail in these\r\ntribunals, I am satisfied that they should be much reformed if the honor\r\nand the honesty of the Army and Navy are by their instrumentality to be\r\nvindicated and protected.\r\n\r\nThe Board on Fortifications or other defenses, appointed in pursuance of\r\nthe provisions of the act of Congress approved March 3, 1885, will in a\r\nshort time present their report, and it is hoped that this may greatly aid\r\nthe legislation so necessary to remedy the present defenseless condition of\r\nour seacoasts.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Signal Service has been prosecuted during the last year\r\nwith results of increasing benefit to the country. The field of instruction\r\nhas been enlarged with a view of adding to its usefulness. The number of\r\nstations in operation June 30, 1885, was 489. Telegraphic reports are\r\nreceived daily from 160 stations. Reports are also received from 25\r\nCanadian stations, 375 volunteer observers, 52 army surgeons at military\r\nposts, and 333 foreign stations. The expense of the service during the\r\nfiscal year, after deducting receipts from military telegraph lines, was\r\n$792,592.97. In view of the fact referred to by the Secretary of War, that\r\nthe work of this service ordinarily is of a scientific nature, and the\r\nfurther fact that it is assuming larger proportions constantly and becoming\r\nmore and more unsuited to the fixed rules which must govern the Army, I am\r\ninclined to agree with him in the opinion that it should be separately\r\nestablished. If this is done, the scope and extent of its operations\r\nshould, as nearly as possible, be definitely prescribed by law and always\r\ncapable of exact ascertainment.\r\n\r\nThe Military Academy at West Point is reported as being in a high state of\r\nefficiency and well equipped for the satisfactory accomplishment of the\r\npurposes of its maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the class which graduates next year is an unusually large one\r\nhas constrained me to decline to make appointments to second lieutenancies\r\nin the Army from civil life, so that such vacancies as exist in these\r\nplaces may be reserved for such graduates; and yet it is not probable that\r\nthere will be enough vacancies to provide positions for them all when they\r\nleave the military school. Under the prevailing law and usage those not\r\nthus assigned to duty never actively enter the military service. It is\r\nsuggested that the law on this subject be changed so that such of these\r\nyoung men as are not at once assigned to duty after graduation may be\r\nretained as second lieutenants in the Army if they desire it, subject to\r\nassignment when opportunity occurs, and under proper rules as to priority\r\nof selection.\r\n\r\nThe expenditures on account of the Military Academy for the last fiscal\r\nyear, exclusive of the sum taken for its purposes from appropriations for\r\nthe support of the Army, were $290,712.07.\r\n\r\nThe act approved March 3, 1885, designed to compensate officers and\r\nenlisted men for loss of private property while in the service of the\r\nUnited States, is so indefinite in its terms and apparently admits so many\r\nclaims the adjustment of which could not have been contemplated that if it\r\nis to remain upon the statute book it needs amendment.\r\n\r\nThere should be a general law of Congress prohibiting the construction of\r\nbridges over navigable waters in such manner as to obstruct navigation,\r\nwith provisions for preventing the same. It seems that under existing\r\nstatutes the Government can not intervene to prevent such a construction\r\nwhen entered upon without its consent, though when such consent is asked\r\nand granted upon condition the authority to insist upon such condition is\r\nclear. Thus it is represented that while the officers of the Government are\r\nwith great care guarding against the obstruction of navigation by a bridge\r\nacross the Mississippi River at St. Paul a large pier for a bridge has been\r\nbuilt just below this place directly in the navigable channel of the river.\r\nIf such things are to be permitted, a strong argument is presented against\r\nthe appropriation of large sums of money to improve the navigation of this\r\nand other important highways of commerce.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy gives a history of the operations\r\nof his Department and the present condition of the work committed to his\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\nHe details in full the course pursued by him to protect the rights of the\r\nGovernment in respect of certain vessels unfinished at the time of his\r\naccession to office, and also concerning the dispatch boat Dolphin, claimed\r\nto be completed and awaiting the acceptance of the Department. No one can\r\nfail to see from recitals contained in this report that only the\r\napplication of business principles has been insisted upon in the treatment\r\nof these subjects, and that whatever controversy has arisen was caused by\r\nthe exaction on the part of the Department of contract obligations as they\r\nwere legally construed. In the case of the Dolphin, with entire justice to\r\nthe contractor, an agreement has been entered into providing for the\r\nascertainment by a judicial inquiry of the complete or partial compliance\r\nwith the contract in her construction, and further providing for the\r\nassessment of any damages to which the Government may be entitled on\r\naccount of a partial failure to perform such contract, or the payment of\r\nthe sum still remaining unpaid upon her price in case a full performance is\r\nadjudged.\r\n\r\nThe contractor, by reason of his failure in business, being unable to\r\ncomplete the other three vessels, they were taken possession of by the\r\nGovernment in their unfinished state under a clause in the contract\r\npermitting such a course, and are now in process of completion in the yard\r\nof the contractor, but under the supervision of the Navy Department.\r\n\r\nCongress at its last session authorized the construction of two additional\r\nnew cruisers and two gunboats, at a cost not exceeding in the aggregate\r\n$2,995,000. The appropriation for this purpose having become available on\r\nthe 1st day of July last, steps were at once taken for the procurement of\r\nsuch plans for the construction of these vessels as would be likely to\r\ninsure their usefulness when completed. These are of the utmost importance,\r\nconsidering the constant advance in the art of building vessels of this\r\ncharacter, and the time is not lost which is spent in their careful\r\nconsideration and selection.\r\n\r\nAll must admit the importance of an effective navy to a nation like ours,\r\nhaving such an extended seacoast to protect; and yet we have not a single\r\nvessel of war that could keep the seas against a first-class vessel of any\r\nimportant power. Such a condition ought not longer to continue. The nation\r\nthat can not resist aggression is constantly exposed to it. Its foreign\r\npolicy is of necessity weak and its negotiations are conducted with\r\ndisadvantage because it is not in condition to enforce the terms dictated\r\nby its sense of right and justice.\r\n\r\nInspired, as I am, by the hope, shared by all patriotic citizens, that the\r\nday is not very far distant when our Navy will be such as befits our\r\nstanding among the nations of the earth, and rejoiced at every step that\r\nleads in the direction of such a consummation, I deem it my duty to\r\nespecially direct the attention of Congress to the close of the report of\r\nthe Secretary of the Navy, in which the humiliating weakness of the present\r\norganization of his Department is exhibited and the startling abuses and\r\nwaste of its present methods are exposed. The conviction is forced upon us\r\nwith the certainty of mathematical demonstration that before we proceed\r\nfurther in the restoration of a Navy we need a thoroughly reorganized Navy\r\nDepartment. The fact that within seventeen years more than $75,000,000 have\r\nbeen spent in the construction, repair, equipment, and armament of vessels,\r\nand the further fact that instead of an effective and creditable fleet we\r\nhave only the discontent and apprehension of a nation undefended by war\r\nvessels, added to the disclosures now made, do not permit us to doubt that\r\nevery attempt to revive our Navy has thus far for the most part been\r\nmisdirected, and all our efforts in that direction have been little better\r\nthan blind gropings and expensive, aimless follies.\r\n\r\nUnquestionably if we are content with the maintenance of a Navy Department\r\nsimply as a shabby ornament to the Government, a constant watchfulness may\r\nprevent some of the scandal and abuse which have found their way into our\r\npresent organization, and its incurable waste may be reduced to the\r\nminimum. But if we desire to build ships for present usefulness instead of\r\nnaval reminders of the days that are past, we must have a Department\r\norganized for the work, supplied with all the talent and ingenuity our\r\ncountry affords, prepared to take advantage of the experience of other\r\nnations, systematized so that all effort shall unite and lead in one\r\ndirection, and fully imbued with the conviction that war vessels, though\r\nnew, are useless unless they combine all that the ingenuity of man has up\r\nto this day brought forth relating to their construction.\r\n\r\nI earnestly commend the portion of the Secretary's report devoted to this\r\nsubject to the attention of Congress, in the hope that his suggestions\r\ntouching the reorganization of his Department may be adopted as the first\r\nstep toward the reconstruction of our Navy.\r\n\r\nThe affairs of the postal service are exhibited by the report of the\r\nPostmaster-General, which will be laid before you.\r\n\r\nThe postal revenue, whose ratio of gain upon the rising prosperity of 1882\r\nand 1883 outstripped the increasing expenses of our growing service, was\r\nchecked by the reduction in the rate of letter postage which took effect\r\nwith the beginning of October in the latter year, and it diminished during\r\nthe two past fiscal years $2,790,000, in about the proportion of $2,270,000\r\nin 1884 to $520,000 in 1885. Natural growth and development have meantime\r\nincreased expenditure, resulting in a deficiency in the revenue to meet the\r\nexpenses of the Department of five and a quarter million dollars for the\r\nyear 1884 and eight and a third million in the last fiscal year. The\r\nanticipated and natural revival of the revenue has been oppressed and\r\nretarded by the unfavorable business condition of the country, of which the\r\npostal service is a faithful indicator. The gratifying fact is shown,\r\nhowever, by the report that our returning prosperity is marked by a gain of\r\n$380,000 in the revenue of the latter half of the last year over the\r\ncorresponding period of the preceding year.\r\n\r\nThe change in the weight of first-class matter which may be carried for a\r\nsingle rate of postage from a half ounce to an ounce, and the reduction by\r\none-half of the rate of newspaper postage, which, under recent legislation,\r\nbegan with the current year, will operate to restrain the augmentation of\r\nreceipts which otherwise might have been expected to such a degree that the\r\nscale of expense may gain upon the revenue and cause an increased\r\ndeficiency to be shown at its close. Yet, after no long period of\r\nreawakened prosperity, by proper economy it is confidently anticipated that\r\neven the present low rates, now as favorable as any country affords, will\r\nbe adequate to sustain the cost of the service.\r\n\r\nThe operation of the Post-Office Department is for the convenience and\r\nbenefit of the people, and the method by which they pay the charges of this\r\nuseful arm of their public service, so that it be just and impartial, is of\r\nless importance to them than the economical expenditure of the means they\r\nprovide for its maintenance and the due improvement of its agencies, so\r\nthat they may enjoy its highest usefulness.\r\n\r\nA proper attention has been directed to the prevention of waste or\r\nextravagance, and good results appear from the report to have already been\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nI approve the recommendation of the Postmaster-General to reduce the\r\ncharges on domestic money orders of $5 and less from 8 to 5 cents. This\r\nchange will materially aid those of our people who most of all avail\r\nthemselves of this instrumentality, but to whom the element of cheapness is\r\nof the greatest importance. With this reduction the system would still\r\nremain self-supporting.\r\n\r\nThe free-delivery system has been extended to 19 additional cities during\r\nthe year, and 178 now enjoy its conveniences. Experience has commended it\r\nto those who enjoy its benefits, and further enlargement of its facilities\r\nis due to other communities to which it is adapted. In the cities where it\r\nhas been established, taken together the local postage exceeds its\r\nmaintenance by nearly $1,300,000. The limit to which this system is now\r\nconfined by law has been nearly reached, and the reasons given justify its\r\nextension, which is proposed.\r\n\r\nIt was decided, with my approbation, after a sufficient examination, to be\r\ninexpedient for the Post-Office Department to contract for carrying our\r\nforeign mails under the additional authority given by the last Congress.\r\nThe amount limited was inadequate to pay all within the purview of the law\r\nthe full rate of 50 cents per mile, and it would have been unjust and\r\nunwise to have given it to some and denied it to others. Nor could\r\ncontracts have been let under the law to all at a rate to have brought the\r\naggregate within the appropriation without such practical prearrangement of\r\nterms as would have violated it.\r\n\r\nThe rate of sea and inland postage which was proffered under another\r\nstatute clearly appears to be a fair compensation for the desired service,\r\nbeing three times the price necessary to secure transportation by other\r\nvessels upon any route, and much beyond the charges made to private persons\r\nfor services not less burdensome.\r\n\r\nSome of the steamship companies, upon the refusal of the Postmaster-General\r\nto attempt, by the means provided, the distribution of the sum appropriated\r\nas an extra compensation, withdrew the services of their vessels and\r\nthereby occasioned slight inconvenience, though no considerable injury, the\r\nmails having been dispatched by other means.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be thought of the policy of subsidizing any line of public\r\nconveyance or travel, I am satisfied that it should not be done under cover\r\nof an expenditure incident to the administration of a Department, nor\r\nshould there be any uncertainty as to the recipients of the subsidy or any\r\ndiscretion left to an executive officer as to its distribution. If such\r\ngifts of the public money are to be made for the purpose of aiding any\r\nenterprise in the supposed interest of the public, I can not but think that\r\nthe amount to be paid and the beneficiary might better be determined by\r\nCongress than in any other way.\r\n\r\nThe international congress of delegates from the Postal Union countries\r\nconvened at Lisbon, in Portugal, in February last, and after a session of\r\nsome weeks the delegates signed a convention amendatory of the present\r\npostal-union convention in some particulars designed to advance its\r\npurposes. This additional act has had my approval and will be laid before\r\nyou with the departmental report.\r\n\r\nI approve the recommendation of the postmaster-General that another\r\nassistant be provided for his Department. I invite your consideration to\r\nthe several other recommendations contained in his report.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Attorney-General contains a history of the conduct of the\r\nDepartment of Justice during the last year and a number of valuable\r\nsuggestions as to needed legislation, and I invite your careful attention\r\nto the same.\r\n\r\nThe condition of business in the courts of the United States is such that\r\nthere seems to be an imperative necessity for remedial legislation on the\r\nsubject. Some of these courts are so overburdened with pending causes that\r\nthe delays in determining litigation amount often to a denial of justice.\r\nAmong the plans suggested for relief is one submitted by the\r\nAttorney-General. Its main features are: The transfer of all the original\r\njurisdiction of the circuit courts to the district courts and an increase\r\nof judges for the latter where necessary; an addition of judges to the\r\ncircuit courts, and constituting them exclusively courts of appeal, and\r\nreasonably limiting appeals thereto; further restrictions of the right to\r\nremove causes from the State to Federal courts; permitting appeals to the\r\nSupreme Court from the courts of the District of Columbia and the\r\nTerritories only in the same cases as they are allowed from State courts,\r\nand guarding against an unnecessary number of appeals from the circuit\r\ncourts.\r\n\r\nI approve the plan thus outlined, and recommend the legislation necessary\r\nfor its application to our judicial system.\r\n\r\nThe present mode of compensating United States marshals and district\r\nattorneys should, in my opinion, be changed. They are allowed to charge\r\nagainst the Government certain fees for services, their income being\r\nmeasured by the amount of such fees within a fixed limit as to their annual\r\naggregate. This is a direct inducement for them to make their fees in\r\ncriminal cases as large as possible in an effort to reach the maximum sum\r\npermitted. As an entirely natural consequence, unscrupulous marshals are\r\nfound encouraging frivolous prosecutions, arresting people on petty charges\r\nof crime and transporting them to distant places for examination and trial,\r\nfor the purpose of earning mileage and other fees; and district attorneys\r\nuselessly attend criminal examinations far from their places of residence\r\nfor the express purpose of swelling their accounts against the Government.\r\nThe actual expenses incurred in these transactions are also charged against\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\nThus the rights and freedom of our citizens are outraged and public\r\nexpenditures increased for the purpose of furnishing public officers\r\npretexts for increasing the measure of their compensation.\r\n\r\nI think marshals and district attorneys should be paid salaries, adjusted\r\nby a rule which will make them commensurate with services fairly rendered.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this subject I desire to suggest the advisability, if it\r\nbe found not obnoxious to constitutional objection, of investing United\r\nStates commissioners with the power to try and determine certain violations\r\nof law within the grade of misdemeanors. Such trials might be made to\r\ndepend upon the option of the accused. The multiplication of small and\r\ntechnical offenses, especially under the provisions of our internal-revenue\r\nlaw, render some change in our present system very desirable in the\r\ninterests of humanity as well as economy. The district courts are now\r\ncrowded with petty prosecutions, involving a punishment in case of\r\nconviction, of only a slight fine, while the parties accused are harassed\r\nby an enforced attendance upon courts held hundreds of miles from their\r\nhomes. If poor and friendless, they are obliged to remain in jail during\r\nmonths, perhaps, that elapse before a session of the court is held, and are\r\nfinally brought to trial surrounded by strangers and with but little real\r\nopportunity for defense. In the meantime frequently the marshal has charged\r\nagainst the Government his fees for an arrest, the transportation of the\r\naccused and the expense of the same, and for summoning witnesses before a\r\ncommissioner, a grand jury, and a court; the witnesses have been paid from\r\nthe public funds large fees and traveling expenses, and the commissioner\r\nand district attorney have also made their charges against the Government.\r\n\r\nThis abuse in the administration of our criminal law should be remedied;\r\nand if the plan above suggested is not practicable, some other should be\r\ndevised.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Interior, containing an account of the\r\noperations of this important Department and much interesting information,\r\nwill be submitted for your consideration.\r\n\r\nThe most intricate and difficult subject in charge of this Department is\r\nthe treatment and management of the Indians. I am satisfied that some\r\nprogress may be noted in their condition as a result of a prudent\r\nadministration of the present laws and regulations for their control.\r\n\r\nBut it is submitted that there is lack of a fixed purpose or policy on this\r\nsubject, which should be supplied. It is useless to dilate upon the wrongs\r\nof the Indians, and as useless to indulge in the heartless belief that\r\nbecause their wrongs are revenged in their own atrocious manner, therefore\r\nthey should be exterminated.\r\n\r\nThey are within the care of our Government, and their rights are, or should\r\nbe, protected from invasion by the most solemn obligations. They are\r\nproperly enough called the wards of the Government; and it should be borne\r\nin mind that this guardianship involves on our part efforts for the\r\nimprovement of their condition and the enforcement of their rights. There\r\nseems to be general concurrence in the proposition that the ultimate object\r\nof their treatment should be their civilization and citizenship. Fitted by\r\nthese to keep pace in the march of progress with the advanced civilization\r\nabout them, they will readily assimilate with the mass of our population,\r\nassuming the responsibilities and receiving the protection incident to this\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty appears to be in the selection of the means to be at present\r\nemployed toward the attainment of this result.\r\n\r\nOur Indian population, exclusive of those in Alaska, is reported as\r\nnumbering 260,000, nearly all being located on lands set apart for their\r\nuse and occupation, aggregating over 134,000,000 acres. These lands are\r\nincluded in the boundaries of 171 reservations of different dimensions,\r\nscattered in 21 States and Territories, presenting great variations in\r\nclimate and in the kind and quality of their soils. Among the Indians upon\r\nthese several reservations there exist the most marked differences in\r\nnatural traits and disposition and in their progress toward civilization.\r\nWhile some are lazy, vicious, and stupid, others are industrious, peaceful,\r\nand intelligent; while a portion of them are self-supporting and\r\nindependent, and have so far advanced in civilization that they make their\r\nown laws, administered through officers of their own choice, and educate\r\ntheir children in schools of their own establishment and maintenance,\r\nothers still retain, in squalor and dependence, almost the savagery of\r\ntheir natural state.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with this question the desires manifested by the Indians should\r\nnot be ignored. Here again we find a great diversity. With some the tribal\r\nrelation is cherished with the utmost tenacity, while its hold upon others\r\nis considerably relaxed; the love of home is strong with all, and yet there\r\nare those whose attachment to a particular locality is by no means\r\nunyielding; the ownership of their lands in severalty is much desired by\r\nsome, while by others, and sometimes among the most civilized, such a\r\ndistribution would be bitterly opposed.\r\n\r\nThe variation of their wants, growing out of and connected with the\r\ncharacter of their several locations, should be regarded. Some are upon\r\nreservations most fit for grazing, but without flocks or herds; and some on\r\narable land, have no agricultural implements. While some of the\r\nreservations are double the size necessary to maintain the number of\r\nIndians now upon them, in a few cases, perhaps, they should be enlarged.\r\n\r\nAdd to all this the difference in the administration of the agencies. While\r\nthe same duties are devolved upon all, the disposition of the agents and\r\nthe manner of their contact with the Indians have much to do with their\r\ncondition and welfare. The agent who perfunctorily performs his duty and\r\nslothfully neglects all opportunity to advance their moral and physical\r\nimprovement and fails to inspire them with a desire for better things will\r\naccomplish nothing in the direction of their civilization, while he who\r\nfeels the burden of an important trust and has an interest in his work\r\nwill, by consistent example, firm yet considerate treatment, and\r\nwell-directed aid and encouragement, constantly lead those under his charge\r\ntoward the light of their enfranchisement.\r\n\r\nThe history of all the progress which has been made in the civilization of\r\nthe Indian I think will disclose the fact that the beginning has been\r\nreligious teaching, followed by or accompanying secular education. While\r\nthe self-sacrificing and pious men and women who have aided in this good\r\nwork by their independent endeavor have for their reward the beneficent\r\nresults of their labor and the consciousness of Christian duty well\r\nperformed, their valuable services should be fully acknowledged by all who\r\nunder the law are charged with the control and management of our Indian\r\nwards.\r\n\r\nWhat has been said indicates that in the present condition of the Indians\r\nno attempt should be made to apply a fixed and unyielding plan of action to\r\ntheir varied and varying needs and circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe Indian Bureau, burdened as it is with their general oversight and with\r\nthe details of the establishment, can hardly possess itself of the minute\r\nphases of the particular cases needing treatment; and thus the propriety of\r\ncreating an instrumentality auxiliary to those already established for the\r\ncare of the Indians suggests itself.\r\n\r\nI recommend the passage of a law authorizing the appointment of six\r\ncommissioners, three of whom shall be detailed from the Army, to be charged\r\nwith the duty of a careful inspection from time to time of all the Indians\r\nupon our reservations or subject to the care and control of the Government,\r\nwith a view of discovering their exact condition and needs and determining\r\nwhat steps shall be taken on behalf of the Government to improve their\r\nsituation in the direction of their self-support and complete civilization;\r\nthat they ascertain from such inspection what, if any, of the reservations\r\nmay be reduced in area, and in such cases what part not needed for Indian\r\noccupation may be purchased by the Government from the Indians and disposed\r\nof for their benefit; what, if any, Indians may, with their consent, be\r\nremoved to other reservations, with a view of their concentration and the\r\nsale on their behalf of their abandoned reservations; what Indian lands now\r\nheld in common should be allotted in severalty; in what manner and to what\r\nextent the Indians upon the reservations can be placed under the protection\r\nof our laws and subjected to their penalties, and which, if any, Indians\r\nshould be invested with the right of citizenship. The powers and functions\r\nof the commissioners in regard to these subjects should be clearly defined,\r\nthough they should, in conjunction with the Secretary of the Interior, be\r\ngiven all the authority to deal definitely with the questions presented\r\ndeemed safe and consistent.\r\n\r\nThey should be also charged with the duty of ascertaining the Indians who\r\nmight properly be furnished with implements of agriculture, and of what\r\nkind; in what cases the support of the Government should be withdrawn;\r\nwhere the present plan of distributing Indian supplies should be changed;\r\nwhere schools may be established and where discontinued; the conduct,\r\nmethods, and fitness of agents in charge of reservations; the extent to\r\nwhich such reservations are occupied or intruded upon by unauthorized\r\npersons, and generally all matters related to the welfare and improvement\r\nof the Indian.\r\n\r\nThey should advise with the Secretary of the Interior concerning these\r\nmatters of detail in management, and he should be given power to deal with\r\nthem fully, if he is not now invested with such power.\r\n\r\nThis plan contemplates the selection of persons for commissioners who are\r\ninterested in the Indian question and who have practical ideas upon the\r\nsubject of their treatment.\r\n\r\nThe expense of the Indian Bureau during the last fiscal year was more than\r\nsix and a halt million dollars. I believe much of this expenditure might be\r\nsaved under the plan proposed; that its economical effects would be\r\nincreased with its continuance; that the safety of our frontier settlers\r\nwould be subserved under its operation, and that the nation would be saved\r\nthrough its results from the imputation of inhumanity, injustice, and\r\nmismanagement.\r\n\r\nIn order to carry out the policy of allotment of Indian lands in severalty,\r\nwhen deemed expedient, it will be necessary to have surveys completed of\r\nthe reservations, and, I hope that provision will be made for the\r\nprosecution of this work.\r\n\r\nIn May of the present year a small portion of the Chiricahua Apaches on the\r\nWhite Mountain Reservation, in Arizona, left the reservation and committed\r\na number of murders and depredations upon settlers in that neighborhood.\r\nThough prompt and energetic action was taken by the military, the renegades\r\neluded capture and escaped into Mexico. The formation of the country\r\nthrough which these Indians passed, their thorough acquaintance with the\r\nsame, the speed of their escape, and the manner in which they scattered and\r\nconcealed themselves among the mountains near the scene of their outrages\r\nput our soldiers at a great disadvantage in their efforts to capture them,\r\nthough the expectation is still entertained that they will be ultimately\r\ntaken and punished for their crimes.\r\n\r\nThe threatening and disorderly conduct of the Cheyennes in the Indian\r\nTerritory early last summer caused considerable alarm and uneasiness.\r\nInvestigation proved that their threatening attitude was due in a great\r\nmeasure to the occupation of the land of their reservation by immense herds\r\nof cattle, which their owners claimed were rightfully there under certain\r\nleases made by the Indians. Such occupation appearing upon examination to\r\nbe unlawful notwithstanding these leases, the intruders were ordered to\r\nremove with their cattle from the lands of the Indians by Executive\r\nproclamation. The enforcement of this proclamation had the effect of\r\nrestoring peace and order among the Indians, and they are now quiet and\r\nwell behaved.\r\n\r\nBy an Executive order issued on February 27, 1885, by my predecessor, a\r\nportion of the tract of country in the territory known as the Old Winnebago\r\nand Crow Creek reservations was directed to be restored to the public\r\ndomain and opened to settlement under the land laws of the United States,\r\nand a large number of persons entered upon those lands. This action alarmed\r\nthe Sioux Indians, who claimed the territory as belonging to their\r\nreservation under the treaty of 1868. This claim was determined, after\r\ncareful investigation, to be well rounded, and consequently the Executive\r\norder referred to was by proclamation of April 17, 1885, declared to be\r\ninoperative and of no effect, and all persons upon the land were warned to\r\nleave. This warning has been substantially complied with.\r\n\r\nThe public domain had its origin in cessions of land by the States to the\r\nGeneral Government. The first cession was made by the State of New York,\r\nand the largest, which in area exceeded all the others, by the State of\r\nVirginia. The territory the proprietorship of which became thus vested in\r\nthe General Government extended from the western line of Pennsylvania to\r\nthe Mississippi River. These patriotic donations of the States were\r\nencumbered with no condition except that they should the held and used \"for\r\nthe common benefit of the United States.\" By purchase with the common fund\r\nof all the people additions were made to this domain until it extended to\r\nthe northern line of Mexico, the Pacific Ocean, and the Polar Sea. The\r\noriginal trust, \"for the common benefit of the United States,\" attached to\r\nall. In the execution of that trust the policy of many homes, rather than\r\nlarge estates, was adopted by the Government. That these might be easily\r\nobtained, and be the abode of security and contentment, the laws for their\r\nacquisition were few, easily understood, and general in their character.\r\nBut the pressure of local interests, combined with a speculative spirit,\r\nhave in many instances procured the passage of laws which marred the\r\nharmony of the general plan and encumbered the system with a multitude of\r\ngeneral and special enactments which render the land laws complicated,\r\nsubject the titles to uncertainty, and the purchasers often to oppression\r\nand wrong. Laws which were intended for the \"common benefit\" have been\r\nperverted so that large quantities of land are vesting in single\r\nownerships. From the multitude and character of the laws, this consequence\r\nseems incapable of correction by mere administration.\r\n\r\nIt is not for the \"common benefit of the United States\" that a large area\r\nof the public lands should be acquired, directly or through fraud, in the\r\nhands of a single individual. The nation's strength is in the people. The\r\nnation's prosperity is in their prosperity. The nation's glory is in the\r\nequality of her justice. The nation's perpetuity is in the patriotism of\r\nall her people. Hence, as far as practicable, the plan adopted in the\r\ndisposal of the public lands should have in view the original policy, which\r\nencouraged many purchases of these lands for homes and discouraged the\r\nmassing of large areas. Exclusive of Alaska, about three-fifths of the\r\nnational domain has been sold or subjected to contract or grant. Of the\r\nremaining two-fifths a considerable portion is either mountain or desert. A\r\nrapidly increasing population creates a growing demand for homes, and the\r\naccumulation of wealth inspires an eager competition to obtain the public\r\nland for speculative purposes. In the future this collision of interests\r\nwill be more marked than in the past, and the execution of the nation's\r\ntrust in behalf of our settlers will be more difficult. I therefore commend\r\nto your attention the recommendations contained in the report of the\r\nSecretary of the Interior with reference to the repeal and modification of\r\ncertain of our land laws.\r\n\r\nThe nation has made princely grants and subsidies to a system of railroads\r\nprojected as great national highways to connect the Pacific States with the\r\nEast. It has been charged that these donations from the people have been\r\ndiverted to private gain and corrupt uses, and thus public indignation has\r\nbeen aroused and suspicion engendered. Our great nation does not begrudge\r\nits generosity, but it abhors speculation and fraud; and the favorable\r\nregard of our people for the great corporations to which these grants were\r\nmade can only be revived by a restoration of confidence, to be secured by\r\ntheir constant, unequivocal, and clearly manifested integrity. A faithful\r\napplication of the undiminished proceeds of the grants to the construction\r\nand perfecting of their roads, an honest discharge of their obligations,\r\nand entire justice to all the people in the enjoyment of their rights on\r\nthese highways of travel are all the public asks, and it will be content\r\nwith no less. To secure these things should be the common purpose of the\r\nofficers of the Government, as well as of the corporations. With this\r\naccomplishment prosperity would be permanently secured to the roads, and\r\nnational pride would take the place of national complaint.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the report of the Commissioner of Pensions that there were\r\non the 1st day of July, 1885, 345,125 persons borne upon the pension rolls,\r\nwho were classified as follows: Army invalids, 241,456; widows, minor\r\nchildren, and dependent relatives of deceased soldiers, 78,841; navy\r\ninvalids, 2,745; navy widows, minor children, and dependents, 1,926;\r\nsurvivors of the War of 1812, 2,945; and widows of those who served in that\r\nwar, 17,212. About one man in ten of all those who enlisted in the late war\r\nare reported as receiving pensions, exclusive of the dependents of deceased\r\nsoldiers. On the 1st of July, 1875, the number of pensioners was 234,821,\r\nand the increase within the ten years next thereafter was 110,304.\r\n\r\nWhile there is no expenditure of the public funds which the people more\r\ncheerfully approve than that made in recognition of the services of our\r\nsoldiers living and dead, the sentiment underlying the subject should not\r\nbe vitiated by the introduction of any fraudulent practices. Therefore it\r\nis fully as important that the rolls should be cleansed of all those who by\r\nfraud have secured a place thereon as that meritorious claims should be\r\nspeedily examined and adjusted. The reforms in the methods of doing the\r\nbusiness of this Bureau which have lately been inaugurated promise better\r\nresults in both these directions.\r\n\r\nThe operations of the Patent Office demonstrate the activity of the\r\ninventive genius of the country. For the year ended June 30, 1885, the\r\napplications for patents, including reissues, and for the registration of\r\ntrade-marks and labels, numbered 35,688. During the same period there were\r\n22,928 patents granted and reissued and 1,429 trade-marks and labels\r\nregistered. The number of patents issued in the year 1875 was 14,387. The\r\nreceipts during the last fiscal year were $ 1,074,974.35, and the total\r\nexpenditures, not including contingent expenses, $934,123.11.\r\n\r\nThere were 9,788 applications for patents pending on the 1st day of July,\r\n1884, and 5,786 on the same date in the year 1885. There has been\r\nconsiderable improvement made in the prompt determination of applications\r\nand a consequent relief to expectant inventors.\r\n\r\nA number of suggestions and recommendations are contained in the report of\r\nthe Commissioner of patents which are well entitled to the consideration of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nIn the Territory of Utah the law of the United States passed for the\r\nSuppression of polygamy has been energetically and faithfully executed\r\nduring the past year, with measurably good results. A number of convictions\r\nhave been secured for unlawful cohabitation, and in some cases pleas of\r\nguilty have been entered and a slight punishment imposed, upon a promise by\r\nthe accused that they would not again offend against the law, nor advise,\r\ncounsel, aid, or abet in any way its violation by others.\r\n\r\nThe Utah commissioners express the opinion, based upon such information as\r\nthey are able to obtain, that but few polygamous marriages have taken place\r\nin the Territory during the last year. They further report that while there\r\ncan not be found upon the registration lists of voters the name of a man\r\nactually guilty of polygamy, and while none of that class are holding\r\noffice, yet at the last election in the Territory all the officers elected,\r\nexcept in one county, were men who, though not actually living in the\r\npractice of polygamy, subscribe to the doctrine of polygamous marriages as\r\na divine revelation and a law unto all higher and more binding upon the\r\nconscience than any human law, local or national. Thus is the strange\r\nspectacle presented of a community protected by a republican form of\r\ngovernment, to which they owe allegiance, sustaining by their suffrages a\r\nprinciple and a belief which set at naught that obligation of absolute\r\nobedience to the law of the land which lies at the foundation of republican\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nThe strength, the perpetuity, and the destiny of the nation rest upon our\r\nhomes, established by the law of God, guarded by parental care, regulated\r\nby parental authority, and sanctified by parental love.\r\n\r\nThese are not the homes of polygamy.\r\n\r\nThe mothers of our land, who rule the nation as they mold the characters\r\nand guide the actions of their sons, live according to God's holy\r\nordinances, and each, secure and happy in the exclusive love of the father\r\nof her children, sheds the warm light of true womanhood, unperverted and\r\nunpolluted, upon all within her pure and wholesome family circle.\r\n\r\nThese are not the cheerless, crushed, and unwomanly mothers of polygamy.\r\n\r\nThe fathers of our families are the best citizens of the Republic. Wife and\r\nchildren are the sources of patriotism, and conjugal and parental affection\r\nbeget devotion to the country. The man who, undefiled with plural marriage,\r\nis surrounded in his single home with his wife and children has a stake in\r\nthe country which inspires him with respect for its laws and courage for\r\nits defense.\r\n\r\nThese are not the fathers of polygamous families.\r\n\r\nThere is no feature of this practice or the system which sanctions it which\r\nis not opposed to all that is of value in our institutions.\r\n\r\nThere should be no relaxation in the firm but just execution of the law now\r\nin operation, and I should be glad to approve such further discreet\r\nlegislation as will rid the country of this blot upon its fair fame.\r\n\r\nSince the people upholding polygamy in our Territories are reenforced by\r\nimmigration from other lands, I recommend that a law be passed to prevent\r\nthe importation of Mormons into the country.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural interest of the country demands just recognition and\r\nliberal encouragement. It sustains with certainty and unfailing strength\r\nour nation's prosperity by the products of its steady toil, and bears its\r\nfull share of the burden of taxation without complaint. Our agriculturists\r\nhave but slight personal representation in the councils of the nation, and\r\nare generally content with the humbler duties of citizenship and willing to\r\ntrust to the bounty of nature for a reward of their labor. But the\r\nmagnitude and value of this industry are appreciated when the statement is\r\nmade that of our total annual exports more than three-fourths are the\r\nproducts of agriculture, and of our total population nearly one-half are\r\nexclusively engaged in that occupation.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Agriculture was created for the purpose of acquiring and\r\ndiffusing among the people useful information respecting the subjects it\r\nhas in charge, and aiding in the cause of intelligent and progressive\r\nfarming, by the collection of statistics, by testing the value and\r\nusefulness of new seeds and plants, and distributing such as are found\r\ndesirable among agriculturists. This and other powers and duties with which\r\nthis Department is invested are of the utmost importance, and if wisely\r\nexercised must be of great benefit to the country. The aim of our\r\nbeneficent Government is the improvement of the people in every station and\r\nthe amelioration of their condition. Surely our agriculturists should not\r\nbe neglected. The instrumentality established in aid of the farmers of the\r\nland should not only be well equipped for the accomplishment of its\r\npurpose, but those for whose benefit it has been adopted should be\r\nencouraged to avail themselves fully of its advantages.\r\n\r\nThe prohibition of the importation into several countries of certain of our\r\nanimals and their products, based upon the suspicion that health is\r\nendangered in their use and consumption, suggests the importance of such\r\nprecautions for the protection of our stock of all kinds against disease as\r\nwill disarm suspicion of danger and cause the removal of such an injurious\r\nprohibition.\r\n\r\nIf the laws now in operation are insufficient to accomplish this\r\nprotection, I recommend their amendment to meet the necessities of the\r\nsituation; and I commend to the consideration of Congress the suggestions\r\ncontained in the report of the Commissioner of Agriculture calculated to\r\nincrease the value and efficiency of this Department.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Civil Service Commission, which will be submitted,\r\ncontains an account of the manner in which the civil-service law has been\r\nexecuted during the last year and much valuable information on this\r\nimportant subject.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to think that there is no sentiment more general in the minds\r\nof the people of our country than a conviction of the correctness of the\r\nprinciple upon which the law enforcing civil-service reform is based. In\r\nits present condition the law regulates only a part of the subordinate\r\npublic positions throughout the country. It applies the test of fitness to\r\napplicants for these places by means of a competitive examination, and\r\ngives large discretion to the Commissioners as to the character of the\r\nexamination and many other matters connected with its execution. Thus the\r\nrules and regulations adopted by the Commission have much to do with the\r\npractical usefulness of the statute and with the results of its\r\napplication.\r\n\r\nThe people may well trust the Commission to execute the law with perfect\r\nfairness and with as little irritation as is possible. But of course no\r\nrelaxation of the principle which underlies it and no weakening of the\r\nsafeguards which surround it can be expected. Experience in its\r\nadministration will probably suggest amendment of the methods of its\r\nexecution, but I venture to hope that we shall never again be remitted to\r\nthe system which distributes public positions purely as rewards for\r\npartisan service. Doubts may well be entertained whether our Government\r\ncould survive the strain of a continuance of this system, which upon every\r\nchange of Administration inspires an immense army of claimants for office\r\nto lay siege to the patronage of Government, engrossing the time of public\r\nofficers with their importunities, spreading abroad the contagion of their\r\ndisappointment, and filling the air with the tumult of their discontent.\r\n\r\nThe allurements of an immense number of offices and places exhibited to the\r\nvoters of the land, and the promise of their bestowal in recognition of\r\npartisan activity; debauch the suffrage and rob political action of its\r\nthoughtful and deliberative character. The evil would increase with the\r\nmultiplication of offices consequent upon our extension, and the mania for\r\noffice holding, growing from its indulgence, would pervade our population\r\nso generally that patriotic purpose, the support of principle, the desire\r\nfor the public good, and solicitude for the nation's welfare would be\r\nnearly banished from the activity of our party contests and cause them to\r\ndegenerate into ignoble, selfish, and disgraceful struggles for the\r\npossession of office and public place.\r\n\r\nCivil-service reform enforced by law came none too soon to check the\r\nprogress of demoralization.\r\n\r\nOne of its effects, not enough regarded, is the freedom it brings to the\r\npolitical action of those conservative and sober men who, in fear of the\r\nconfusion and risk attending an arbitrary and sudden change in all the\r\npublic offices with a change of party rule, cast their ballots against such\r\na chance.\r\n\r\nParties seem to be necessary, and will long continue to exist; nor can it\r\nbe now denied that there are legitimate advantages, not disconnected with\r\noffice holding, which follow party supremacy. While partisanship continues\r\nbitter and pronounced and supplies so much of motive to sentiment and\r\naction, it is not fair to hold public officials in charge of important\r\ntrusts responsible for the best results in the performance of their duties,\r\nand yet insist that they shall rely in confidential and important places\r\nupon the work of those not only opposed to them in political affiliation,\r\nbut so steeped in partisan prejudice and rancor that they have no loyalty\r\nto their chiefs and no desire for their success. Civil-service reform does\r\nnot exact this, nor does it require that those in subordinate positions who\r\nfail in yielding their best service or who are incompetent should be\r\nretained simply because they are in place. The whining of a clerk\r\ndischarged for indolence or incompetency, who, though he gained his place\r\nby the worst possible operation of the spoils system, suddenly discovers\r\nthat he is entitled to protection under the sanction of civil-service\r\nreform, represents an idea no less absurd than the clamor of the applicant\r\nwho claims the vacant position as his compensation for the most\r\nquestionable party work.\r\n\r\nThe civil-service law does not prevent the discharge of the indolent or\r\nincompetent clerk, but it does prevent supplying his place with the unfit\r\nparty worker. Thus in both these phases is seen benefit to the public\r\nservice. And the people who desire good government, having secured this\r\nstatute, will not relinquish its benefits without protest. Nor are they\r\nunmindful of the fact that its full advantages can only be gained through\r\nthe complete good faith of those having its execution in charge. And this\r\nthey will insist upon.\r\n\r\nI recommend that the salaries of the Civil Service Commissioners be\r\nincreased to a sum more nearly commensurate to their important duties.\r\n\r\nIt is a source of considerable and not unnatural discontent that no\r\nadequate provision has yet been made for accommodating the principal\r\nlibrary of the Government. Of the vast collection of books and pamphlets\r\ngathered at the Capitol, numbering some 700,000, exclusive of manuscripts,\r\nmaps, and the products of the graphic arts, also of great volume and value,\r\nonly about 300,000 volumes, or less than half the collection, are provided\r\nwith shelf room. The others, which are increasing at the rate of from\r\ntwenty-five to thirty thousand volumes a year, are not only inaccessible to\r\nthe public, but are subject to serious damage and deterioration from other\r\ncauses in their present situation.\r\n\r\nA consideration of the facts that the library of the Capitol has twice been\r\ndestroyed or damaged by fire, its daily increasing value, and its\r\nimportance as a place of deposit of books under the law relating to\r\ncopyright makes manifest the necessity of prompt action to insure its\r\nproper accommodation and protection.\r\n\r\nMy attention has been called to a controversy which has arisen from the\r\ncondition of the law relating to railroad facilities in the city of\r\nWashington, which has involved the Commissioners of the District in much\r\nannoyance and trouble. I hope this difficulty will be promptly settled by\r\nappropriate legislation.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners represent that enough of the revenues of the District are\r\nnow on deposit in the Treasury of the United States to repay the sum\r\nadvanced by the Government for sewer improvements under the act of June 30,\r\n1884. They desire now an advance of the share which ultimately should be\r\nborne by the District of the cost of extensive improvements to the streets\r\nof the city. The total expense of these contemplated improvements is\r\nestimated at $1,000,000, and they are of the opinion that a considerable\r\nsum could be saved if they had all the money in hand, so that contracts for\r\nthe whole work could be made at the same time. They express confidence that\r\nif the advance asked for should be made the Government would be reimbursed\r\nthe same within a reasonable time. I have no doubt that these improvements\r\ncould be made much cheaper if undertaken together and prosecuted according\r\nto a general plan.\r\n\r\nThe license law now in force within the District is deficient and uncertain\r\nin some of its provisions and ought to be amended. The Commissioners urge,\r\nwith good reason, the necessity of providing a building for the use of the\r\nDistrict government which shall better secure the safety and preservation\r\nof its valuable books and records.\r\n\r\nThe present condition of the law relating to the succession to the\r\nPresidency in the event of the death, disability, or removal of both the\r\nPresident and Vice-President is such as to require immediate amendment.\r\nThis subject has repeatedly been considered by Congress, but no result has\r\nbeen reached. The recent lamentable death of the Vice-President, and\r\nvacancies at the same time in all other offices the incumbents of which\r\nmight immediately exercise the functions of the presidential office, has\r\ncaused public anxiety and a just demand that a recurrence of such a\r\ncondition of affairs should not be permitted.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I commend to the wise care and thoughtful attention of\r\nCongress the needs, the welfare, and the aspirations of an intelligent and\r\ngenerous nation. To subordinate these to the narrow advantages of\r\npartisanship or the accomplishment of selfish aims is to violate the\r\npeople's trust and betray the people's interests; but an individual sense\r\nof responsibility on the part of each of us and a stern determination to\r\nperform our duty well must give us place among those who have added in\r\ntheir day and generation to the glory and prosperity of our beloved land.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nGrover Cleveland\r\nDecember 6, 1886\r\n\r\nTo the Congress of the United States:\r\n\r\nIn discharge of a constitutional duty, and following a well-established\r\nprecedent in the Executive office, I herewith transmit to the Congress at\r\nits reassembling certain information concerning the state of the Union,\r\ntogether with such recommendations for legislative consideration as appear\r\nnecessary and expedient.\r\n\r\nOur Government has consistently maintained its relations of friendship\r\ntoward all other powers and of neighborly interest toward those whose\r\npossessions are contiguous to our own. Few questions have arisen during the\r\npast year with other governments, and none of those are beyond the reach of\r\nsettlement in friendly counsel.\r\n\r\nWe are as yet without provision for the settlement of claims of citizens of\r\nthe United States against Chile for injustice during the late war with Peru\r\nand Bolivia. The mixed commissions organized under claims conventions\r\nconcluded by the Chilean Government with certain European States have\r\ndeveloped an amount of friction which we trust can be avoided in the\r\nconvention which our representative at Santiago is authorized to\r\nnegotiate.\r\n\r\nThe cruel treatment of inoffensive Chinese has, I regret to say, been\r\nrepeated in some of the far Western States and Territories, and acts of\r\nviolence against those people, beyond the power of the local constituted\r\nauthorities to prevent and difficult to punish, are reported even in\r\ndistant Alaska. Much of this violence can be traced to race prejudice and\r\ncompetition of labor, which can not, however, justify the oppression of\r\nstrangers whose safety is guaranteed by our treaty with China equally with\r\nthe most favored nations.\r\n\r\nIn opening our vast domain to alien elements the purpose of our lawgivers\r\nwas to invite assimilation, and not to provide an arena for endless\r\nantagonism. The paramount duty of maintaining public order and defending\r\nthe interests of our own people may require the adoption of measures of\r\nrestriction, but they should not tolerate the oppression of individuals of\r\na special race. I am not without assurance that the Government of China,\r\nwhose friendly disposition toward us I am most happy to recognize, will\r\nmeet us halfway in devising a comprehensive remedy by which an effective\r\nlimitation of Chinese emigration, joined to protection of those Chinese\r\nsubjects who remain in this country, may be secured.\r\n\r\nLegislation is needed to execute the provisions of our Chinese convention\r\nof 1880 touching the opium traffic.\r\n\r\nWhile the good will of the Colombian Government toward our country is\r\nmanifest, the situation of American interests on the Isthmus of Panama has\r\nat times excited concern and invited friendly action looking to the\r\nperformance of the engagements of the two nations concerning the territory\r\nembraced in the interoceanic transit. With the subsidence of the Isthmian\r\ndisturbances and the erection of the State of Panama into a federal\r\ndistrict under the direct government of the constitutional administration\r\nat Bogota, a new order of things has been inaugurated, which, although as\r\nyet somewhat experimental and affording scope for arbitrary exercise of\r\npower by the delegates of the national authority, promises much\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\nThe sympathy between the people of the United States and France, born\r\nduring our colonial struggle for independence and continuing today, has\r\nreceived a fresh impulse in the successful completion and dedication of the\r\ncolossal statue of \"Liberty Enlightening the World\" in New York Harbor--the\r\ngift of Frenchmen to Americans.\r\n\r\nA convention between the United States and certain other powers for the\r\nprotection of submarine cables was signed at Paris on March 14, 1884, and\r\nhas been duly ratified and proclaimed by this Government. By agreement\r\nbetween the high contracting parties this convention is to go into effect\r\non the 1st of January next, but the legislation required for its execution\r\nin the United States has not yet been adopted. I earnestly recommend its\r\nenactment.\r\n\r\nCases have continued to occur in Germany giving rise to much correspondence\r\nin relation to the privilege of sojourn of our naturalized citizens of\r\nGerman origin revisiting the land of their birth, yet I am happy to state\r\nthat our relations with that country have lost none of their accustomed\r\ncordiality.\r\n\r\nThe claims for interest upon the amount of tonnage dues illegally exacted\r\nfrom certain German steamship lines were favorably reported in both Houses\r\nof Congress at the last session, and I trust will receive final and\r\nfavorable action at an early day.\r\n\r\nThe recommendations contained in my last annual message in relation to a\r\nmode of settlement of the fishery rights in the waters of British North\r\nAmerica, so long a subject of anxious difference between the United States\r\nand Great Britain, was met by an adverse vote of the Senate on April 13\r\nlast, and thereupon negotiations were instituted to obtain an agreement\r\nwith Her Britannic Majesty's Government for the promulgation of such joint\r\ninterpretation and definition of the article of the convention of 1818\r\nrelating to the territorial waters and inshore fisheries of the British\r\nProvinces as should secure the Canadian rights from encroachment by the\r\nUnited States fishermen and at the same time insure the enjoyment by the\r\nlatter of the privileges guaranteed to them by such convention.\r\n\r\nThe questions involved are of long standing, of grave consequence, and from\r\ntime to time for nearly three-quarters of a century have given rise to\r\nearnest international discussions, not unaccompanied by irritation.\r\n\r\nTemporary arrangements by treaties have served to allay friction, which,\r\nhowever, has revived as each treaty was terminated. The last arrangement,\r\nunder the treaty of 1871, was abrogated after due notice by the United\r\nStates on June 30, 1885, but I was enabled to obtain for our fishermen for\r\nthe remainder of that season enjoyment of the full privileges accorded by\r\nthe terminated treaty.\r\n\r\nThe joint high commission by whom the treaty had been negotiated, although\r\ninvested with plenary power to make a permanent settlement, were content\r\nwith a temporary arrangement, after the termination of which the question\r\nwas relegated to the stipulations of the treaty of 1818, as to the first\r\narticle of which no construction satisfactory to both countries has ever\r\nbeen agreed upon.\r\n\r\nThe progress of civilization and growth of population in the British\r\nProvinces to which the fisheries in question are contiguous and the\r\nexpansion of commercial intercourse between them and the United States\r\npresent to-day a condition of affairs scarcely realizable at the date of\r\nthe negotiations of 1818.\r\n\r\nNew and vast interests have been brought into existence; modes of\r\nintercourse between the respective countries have been invented and\r\nmultiplied; the methods of conducting the fisheries have been wholly\r\nchanged; and all this is necessarily entitled to candid and careful\r\nconsideration in the adjustment of the terms and conditions of intercourse\r\nand commerce between the United States and their neighbors along a frontier\r\nof over 3,500 miles.\r\n\r\nThis propinquity, community of language and occupation, and similarity of\r\npolitical and social institutions indicate the practicability and obvious\r\nwisdom of maintaining mutually beneficial and friendly relations.\r\n\r\nWhilst I am unfeignedly desirous that such relations should exist between\r\nus and the inhabitants of Canada, yet the action of their officials during\r\nthe past season toward our fishermen has been such as to seriously threaten\r\ntheir continuance.\r\n\r\nAlthough disappointed in my efforts to secure a satisfactory settlement of\r\nthe fishery question, negotiations are still pending, with reasonable hope\r\nthat before the close of the present session of Congress announcement may\r\nbe made that an acceptable conclusion has been reached.\r\n\r\nAs at an early day there may be laid before Congress the correspondence of\r\nthe Department of State in relation to this important subject, so that the\r\nhistory of the past fishing season may be fully disclosed and the action\r\nand the attitude of the Administration clearly comprehended, a more\r\nextended reference is not deemed necessary in this communication.\r\n\r\nThe recommendation submitted last year that provision be made for a\r\npreliminary reconnoissance of the conventional boundary line between Alaska\r\nand British Columbia is renewed.\r\n\r\nI express my unhesitating conviction that the intimacy of our relations\r\nwith Hawaii should be emphasized. As a result of the reciprocity treaty of\r\n1875, those islands, on the highway of Oriental and Australasian traffic,\r\nare virtually an outpost of American commerce and a stepping-stone to the\r\ngrowing trade of the Pacific. The Polynesian Island groups have been so\r\nabsorbed by other and more powerful governments that the Hawaiian Islands\r\nare left almost alone in the enjoyment of their autonomy, which it is\r\nimportant for us should be preserved. Our treaty is now terminable on one\r\nyear's notice, but propositions to abrogate it would be, in my judgment,\r\nmost ill advised. The paramount influence we have there acquired, once\r\nrelinquished, could only with difficulty be regained, and a valuable ground\r\nof vantage for ourselves might be converted into a stronghold for our\r\ncommercial competitors. I earnestly recommend that the existing treaty\r\nstipulations be extended for a further term of seven years. A recently\r\nsigned treaty to this end is now before the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe importance of telegraphic communication between those islands and the\r\nUnited States should not be overlooked.\r\n\r\nThe question of a general revision of the treaties of Japan is again under\r\ndiscussion at Tokyo. As the first to open relations with that Empire, and\r\nas the nation in most direct commercial relations with Japan, the United\r\nStates have lost no opportunity to testify their consistent friendship by\r\nsupporting the just claims of Japan to autonomy and independence among\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nA treaty of extradition between the United States and Japan, the first\r\nconcluded by that Empire, has been lately proclaimed.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of Liberia and the difficulty of maintaining effective\r\nsovereignty over its outlying districts have exposed that Republic to\r\nencroachment. It can not be forgotten that this distant community is an\r\noffshoot of our own system, owing its origin to the associated benevolence\r\nof American citizens, whose praiseworthy efforts to create a nucleus of\r\ncivilization in the Dark Continent have commanded respect and sympathy\r\neverywhere, especially in this country. Although a formal protectorate over\r\nLiberia is contrary to our traditional policy, the moral right and duty of\r\nthe United States to assist in all proper ways in the maintenance of its\r\nintegrity is obvious, and has been consistently announced during nearly\r\nhalf a century. I recommend that in the reorganization of our Navy a small\r\nvessel, no longer found adequate to our needs, be presented to Liberia, to\r\nbe employed by it in the protection of its coastwise revenues.\r\n\r\nThe encouraging development of beneficial and intimate relations between\r\nthe United States and Mexico, which has been so marked within the past few\r\nyears, is at once the occasion of congratulation and of friendly\r\nsolicitude. I urgently renew my former representation of the need or speedy\r\nlegislation by Congress to carry into effect the reciprocity commercial\r\nconvention of January 20, 1883.\r\n\r\nOur commercial treaty of 1831 with Mexico was terminated, according to its\r\nprovisions, in 1881, upon notification given by Mexico in pursuance of her\r\nannounced policy of recasting all her commercial treaties. Mexico has since\r\nconcluded with several foreign governments new treaties of commerce and\r\nnavigation, defining alien rights of trade, property, and residence,\r\ntreatment of shipping, consular privileges, and the like. Our yet\r\nunexecuted reciprocity convention of 1883 covers none of these points, the\r\nsettlement of which is so necessary to good relationship. I propose to\r\ninitiate with Mexico negotiations for a new and enlarged treaty of commerce\r\nand navigation.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the Senate, I communicated to that body\r\non August 2 last, and also to the House of Representatives, the\r\ncorrespondence in the case of A. K. Cutting, an American citizen, then\r\nimprisoned in Mexico, charged with the commission of a penal offense in\r\nTexas, of which a Mexican citizen was the object.\r\n\r\nAfter demand had been made for his release the charge against him was\r\namended so as to include a violation of Mexican law within Mexican\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nThis joinder of alleged offenses, one within and the other exterior to\r\nMexico, induced me to order a special investigation of the case, pending\r\nwhich Mr. Cutting was released.\r\n\r\nThe incident has, however, disclosed a claim of jurisdiction by Mexico\r\nnovel in our history, whereby any offense committed anywhere by a\r\nforeigner, penal in the place of its commission, and of which a Mexican is\r\nthe object, may, if the offender be found in Mexico, be there tried and\r\npunished in conformity with Mexican laws.\r\n\r\nThis jurisdiction was sustained by the courts of Mexico in the Cutting\r\ncase, and approved by the executive branch of that Government, upon the\r\nauthority of a Mexican statute. The appellate court in releasing Mr.\r\nCutting decided that the abandonment of the complaint by the Mexican\r\ncitizen aggrieved by the alleged crime (a libelous publication) removed the\r\nbasis of further prosecution, and also declared justice to have been\r\nsatisfied by the enforcement of a small part of the original sentence.\r\n\r\nThe admission of such a pretension would be attended with serious results,\r\ninvasive of the jurisdiction of this Government and highly dangerous to our\r\ncitizens in foreign lands. Therefore I have denied it and protested against\r\nits attempted exercise as unwarranted by the principles of law and\r\ninternational usages.\r\n\r\nA sovereign has jurisdiction of offenses which take effect within his\r\nterritory, although concocted or commenced outside of it; but the right is\r\ndenied of any foreign sovereign to punish a citizen of the United States\r\nfor an offense consummated on our soil in violation of our laws, even\r\nthough the offense be against a subject or citizen of such sovereign. The\r\nMexican statute in question makes the claim broadly, and the principle, if\r\nconceded, would create a dual responsibility in the citizen and lead to\r\ninextricable confusion, destructive of that certainty in the law which is\r\nan essential of liberty.\r\n\r\nWhen citizens of the United States voluntarily go into a foreign country,\r\nthey must abide by the laws there in force, and will not be protected by\r\ntheir own Government from the consequences of an offense against those laws\r\ncommitted in such foreign country; but watchful care and interest of this\r\nGovernment over its citizens are not relinquished because they have gone\r\nabroad, and if charged with crime committed in the foreign land a fair and\r\nopen trial, conducted with decent regard for justice and humanity, will be\r\ndemanded for them. With less than that this Government will not be content\r\nwhen the life or liberty of its citizens is at stake.\r\n\r\nWhatever the degree to which extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction may\r\nhave been formerly allowed by consent and reciprocal agreement among\r\ncertain of the European States, no such doctrine or practice was ever known\r\nto the laws of this country or of that from which our institutions have\r\nmainly been derived.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Mexico there are reasons especially strong for perfect\r\nharmony in the mutual exercise of jurisdiction. Nature has made us\r\nirrevocably neighbors, and wisdom and kind feeling should make us friends.\r\n\r\nThe overflow of capital and enterprise from the United States is a potent\r\nfactor in assisting the development of the resources of Mexico and in\r\nbuilding up the prosperity of both countries.\r\n\r\nTo assist this good work all grounds of apprehension for the security of\r\nperson and property should be removed; and I trust that in the interests of\r\ngood neighborhood the statute referred to will be so modified as to\r\neliminate the present possibilities of danger to the peace of the two\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nThe Government of the Netherlands has exhibited concern in relation to\r\ncertain features of our tariff laws, which are supposed by them to be aimed\r\nat a class of tobacco produced in the Dutch East Indies. Comment would seem\r\nunnecessary upon the unwisdom of legislation appearing to have a special\r\nnational discrimination for its object, which, although unintentional, may\r\ngive rise to injurious retaliation.\r\n\r\nThe establishment, less than four years ago, of a legation at Teheran is\r\nbearing fruit in the interest exhibited by the Shah's Government in the\r\nindustrial activity of the United States and the opportunities of\r\nbeneficial interchanges.\r\n\r\nStable government is now happily restored in Peru by the election of a\r\nconstitutional president, and a period of rehabilitation is entered upon;\r\nbut the recovery is necessarily slow from the exhaustion caused by the late\r\nwar and civil disturbances. A convention to adjust by arbitration claims of\r\nour citizens has been proposed and is under consideration.\r\n\r\nThe naval officer who bore to Siberia the testimonials bestowed by Congress\r\nin recognition of the aid given to the Jeannette survivors has successfully\r\naccomplished his mission. His interesting report will be submitted. It is\r\npleasant to know that this mark of appreciation has been welcomed by the\r\nRussian Government and people as befits the traditional friendship of the\r\ntwo countries.\r\n\r\nCivil perturbations in the Samoan Islands have during the past few years\r\nbeen a source of considerable embarrassment to the three\r\nGovernments-Germany, Great Britain, and the United States--whose relations\r\nand extraterritorial rights in that important group are guaranteed by\r\ntreaties. The weakness of the native administration and the conflict of\r\nopposing interests in the islands have led King Malietoa to seek alliance\r\nor protection in some one quarter, regardless of the distinct engagements\r\nwhereby no one of the three treaty powers may acquire any paramount or\r\nexclusive interest. In May last Malietoa offered to place Samoa under the\r\nprotection of the United States, and the late consul, without authority,\r\nassumed to grant it. The proceeding was promptly disavowed and the\r\noverzealous official recalled. Special agents of the three Governments have\r\nbeen deputed to examine the situation in the islands. With a change in the\r\nrepresentation of all three powers and a harmonious understanding between\r\nthem, the peace, prosperity, autonomous administration, and neutrality of\r\nSamoa can hardly fail to be secured.\r\n\r\nIt appearing that the Government of Spain did not extend to the flag of the\r\nUnited States in the Antilles the full measure of reciprocity requisite\r\nunder our statute for the continuance of the suspension of discriminations\r\nagainst the Spanish flag in our ports, I was constrained in October last to\r\nrescind my predecessor's proclamation of February 14, 1884, permitting such\r\nsuspension. An arrangement was, however, speedily reached, and upon\r\nnotification from the Government of Spain that all differential treatment\r\nof our vessels and their cargoes, from the United States or from any\r\nforeign country, had been completely and absolutely relinquished, I availed\r\nmyself of the discretion conferred by law and issued on the 27th of October\r\nmy proclamation declaring reciprocal suspension in the United States. It is\r\nmost gratifying to bear testimony to the earnest spirit in which the\r\nGovernment of the Queen Regent has met our efforts to avert the initiation\r\nof commercial discriminations and reprisals, which are ever disastrous to\r\nthe material interests and the political good will of the countries they\r\nmay affect.\r\n\r\nThe profitable development of the large commercial exchanges between the\r\nUnited States and the Spanish Antilles is naturally an object of\r\nsolicitude. Lying close at our doors, and finding here their main markets\r\nof supply and demand, the welfare of Cuba and Puerto Rico and their\r\nproduction and trade are scarcely less important to us than to Spain. Their\r\ncommercial and financial movements are so naturally a part of our system\r\nthat no obstacle to fuller and freer intercourse should be permitted to\r\nexist. The standing instructions of our representatives at Madrid and\r\nHavana have for years been to leave no effort unessayed to further these\r\nends, and at no time has the equal good desire of Spain been more hopefully\r\nmanifested than now.\r\n\r\nThe Government of Spain, by removing the consular tonnage fees on cargoes\r\nshipped to the Antilles and by reducing passport fees, has shown its\r\nrecognition of the needs of less trammeled intercourse.\r\n\r\nAn effort has been made during the past year to remove the hindrances to\r\nthe proclamation of the treaty of naturalization with the Sublime Porte,\r\nsigned in 1874, which has remained inoperative owing to a disagreement of\r\ninterpretation of the clauses relative to the effects of the return to and\r\nsojourn of a naturalized citizen in the land of origin. I trust soon to be\r\nable to announce a favorable settlement of the differences as to this\r\ninterpretation.\r\n\r\nIt has been highly satisfactory to note the improved treatment of American\r\nmissionaries in Turkey, as has been attested by their acknowledgments to\r\nour late minister to that Government of his successful exertions in their\r\nbehalf.\r\n\r\nThe exchange of ratifications of the convention of December 5, 1885, with\r\nVenezuela, for the reopening of the awards of the Caracas Commission under\r\nthe claims convention of 1866, has not yet been effected, owing to the\r\ndelay of the Executive of that Republic in ratifying the measure. I trust\r\nthat this postponement will be brief; but should it much longer continue,\r\nthe delay may well be regarded as a rescission of the compact and a failure\r\non the part of Venezuela to complete an arrangement so persistently sought\r\nby her during many years and assented to by this Government in a spirit of\r\ninternational fairness, although to the detriment of holders of bona fide\r\nawards of the impugned commission.\r\n\r\nI renew the recommendation of my last annual message that existing\r\nlegislation concerning citizenship and naturalization be revised. We have\r\ntreaties with many states providing for the renunciation of citizenship by\r\nnaturalized aliens, but no statute is found to give effect to such\r\nengagements, nor any which provides a needed central bureau for the\r\nregistration of naturalized citizens.\r\n\r\nExperience suggests that our statutes regulating extradition might be\r\nadvantageously amended by a provision for the transit across our territory,\r\nnow a convenient thoroughfare of travel from one foreign country to\r\nanother, of fugitives surrendered by a foreign government to a third state.\r\nSuch provisions are not unusual in the legislation of other countries, and\r\ntend to prevent the miscarriage of justice. It is also desirable, in order\r\nto remove present uncertainties, that authority should be conferred on the\r\nSecretary of State to issue a certificate, in case of an arrest for the\r\npurpose of extradition, to the officer before whom the proceeding is\r\npending, showing that a requisition for the surrender of the person charged\r\nhas been duly made. Such a certificate, if required to be received before\r\nthe prisoner's examination, would prevent a long and expensive judicial\r\ninquiry into a charge which the foreign government might not desire to\r\npress. I also recommend that express provision be made for the immediate\r\ndischarge from custody of persons committed for extradition where the\r\nPresident is of opinion that surrender should not be made.\r\n\r\nThe drift of sentiment in civilized communities toward full recognition of\r\nthe rights of property in the creations of the human intellect has brought\r\nabout the adoption by many important nations of an international copyright\r\nconvention, which was signed at Berne on the 18th of September, 1885.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the Constitution gives to the Congress the power \"to promote\r\nthe progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to\r\nauthors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and\r\ndiscoveries,\" this Government did not feel warranted in becoming a\r\nsignatory pending the action of Congress upon measures of international\r\ncopyright now before it; but the right of adhesion to the Berne convention\r\nhereafter has been reserved. I trust the subject will receive at your hands\r\nthe attention it deserves, and that the just claims of authors, so urgently\r\npressed, will be duly heeded.\r\n\r\nRepresentations continue to be made to me of the injurious effect upon\r\nAmerican artists studying abroad and having free access to the art\r\ncollections of foreign countries of maintaining a discriminating duty\r\nagainst the introduction of the works of their brother artists of other\r\ncountries, and I am induced to repeat my recommendation for the abolition\r\nof that tax.\r\n\r\nPursuant to a provision of the diplomatic and consular appropriation act\r\napproved July 1, 1886, the estimates submitted by the Secretary of State\r\nfor the maintenance of the consular service have been recast on the basis\r\nof salaries for all officers to whom such allowance is deemed advisable.\r\nAdvantage has been taken of this to redistribute the salaries of the\r\noffices now appropriated for, in accordance with the work performed, the\r\nimportance of the representative duties of the incumbent, and the cost of\r\nliving at each post. The last consideration has been too often lost sight\r\nof in the allowances heretofore made. The compensation which may suffice\r\nfor the decent maintenance of a worthy and capable officer in a position of\r\nonerous and representative trust at a post readily accessible, and where\r\nthe necessaries of life are abundant and cheap, may prove an inadequate\r\npittance in distant lands, where the better part of a year's pay is\r\nconsumed in reaching the post of duty, and where the comforts of ordinary\r\ncivilized existence can only be obtained with difficulty and at exorbitant\r\ncost. I trust that in considering the submitted schedules no mistaken\r\ntheory of economy will perpetuate a system which in the past has virtually\r\nclosed to deserving talent many offices where capacity and attainments of a\r\nhigh order are indispensable, and in not a few instances has brought\r\ndiscredit on our national character and entailed embarrassment and even\r\nsuffering on those deputed to uphold our dignity and interests abroad.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this subject I earnestly reiterate the practical\r\nnecessity of supplying some mode of trustworthy inspection and report of\r\nthe manner in which the consulates are conducted. In the absence of such\r\nreliable information efficiency can scarcely be rewarded or its opposite\r\ncorrected.\r\n\r\nIncreasing competition in trade has directed attention to the value of the\r\nconsular reports printed by the Department of State, and the efforts of the\r\nGovernment to extend the practical usefulness of these reports have created\r\na wider demand for them at home and a spirit of emulation abroad.\r\nConstituting a record at the changes occurring in trade and of the progress\r\nof the arts and invention in foreign countries, they are much sought for by\r\nall interested in the subjects which they embrace.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Treasury exhibits in detail the\r\ncondition of the public finances and of the several branches of the\r\nGovernment related to his Department. I especially direct the attention of\r\nthe Congress to the recommendations contained in this and the last\r\npreceding report of the Secretary touching the simplification and amendment\r\nof the laws relating to the collection of our revenues, and in the interest\r\nof economy and justice to the Government I hope they may be adopted by\r\nappropriate legislation.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary receipts of the Government for the fiscal year ended June 30,\r\n1886, were $336,439,727.06. Of this amount $192,905,023.41 was received\r\nfrom customs and $116,805,936.48 from internal revenue. The total receipts,\r\nas here stated, were $13,749,020.68 greater than for the previous year, but\r\nthe increase from customs was $11,434,084.10 and from internal revenue\r\n$4,407,210.94, making a gain in these items for the last year of\r\n$15,841,295.04, a falling off in other resources reducing the total\r\nincrease to the smaller amount mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe expense at the different custom-houses of collecting this increased\r\ncustoms revenue was less than the expense attending the collection of such\r\nrevenue for the preceding year by $490,608, and the increased receipts of\r\ninternal revenue were collected at a cost to the Internal-Revenue Bureau\r\n$155,944.99 less than the expense of such collection for the previous\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe total ordinary expenses of the Government for the fiscal year ended\r\nJune 30, 1886, were $242,483,138.50, being less by $17,788,797 than such\r\nexpenditures for the year preceding, and leaving a surplus in the Treasury\r\nat the close of the last fiscal year of $93,956,588.56, as against\r\n$63,463,771.27 at the close of the previous year, being an increase in such\r\nsurplus of $30,492,817.29.\r\n\r\nThe expenditures are compared with those of the preceding fiscal year and\r\nclassified as follows:\r\n\r\nFor the current year to end June 30, 1887, the ascertained receipts up to\r\nOctober 1, 1886, with such receipts estimated for the remainder of the\r\nyear, amount to $356,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe expenditures ascertained and estimated for the same period are\r\n$266,000,000, indicating an anticipated surplus at the close of the year of\r\n$90,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe total value of the exports from the United States to foreign countries\r\nduring the fiscal year is stated and compared with the preceding year as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nThe value of some of our leading exports during the last fiscal year, as\r\ncompared with the value of the same for the year immediately preceding, is\r\nhere given, and furnishes information both interesting and suggestive:\r\n\r\nOur imports during the last fiscal year, as compared with the previous\r\nyear, were as follows:\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message to the Congress attention was directed to the\r\nfact that the revenues of the Government exceeded its actual needs, and it\r\nwas suggested that legislative action should be taken to relieve the people\r\nfrom the unnecessary burden of taxation thus made apparent.\r\n\r\nIn view of the pressing importance of the subject I deem it my duty to\r\nagain urge its consideration.\r\n\r\nThe income of the Government, by its increased volume and through economies\r\nin its collection, is now more than ever in excess of public necessities.\r\nThe application of the surplus to the payment of such portion of the public\r\ndebt as is now at our option subject to extinguishment, if continued at the\r\nrate which has lately prevailed, would retire that class of indebtedness\r\nwithin less than one year from this date. Thus a continuation of our\r\npresent revenue system would soon result in the receipt of an annual income\r\nmuch greater than necessary to meet Government expenses, with no\r\nindebtedness upon which it could be applied. We should then be confronted\r\nwith a vast quantity of money, the circulating medium of the people,\r\nhoarded in the Treasury when it should be in their hands, or we should be\r\ndrawn into wasteful public extravagance, with all the corrupting national\r\ndemoralization which follows in its train.\r\n\r\nBut it is not the simple existence of this surplus and its threatened\r\nattendant evils which furnish the strongest argument against our present\r\nscale of Federal taxation. Its worst phase is the exaction of such a\r\nsurplus through a perversion of the relations between the people and their\r\nGovernment and a dangerous departure from the rules which limit the right\r\nof Federal taxation.\r\n\r\nGood government, and especially the government of which every American\r\ncitizen boasts, has for its objects the protection of every person within\r\nits care in the greatest liberty consistent with the good order of society\r\nand his perfect security in the enjoyment of his earnings with the least\r\npossible diminution for public needs. When more of the people's substance\r\nis exacted through the form of taxation than is necessary to meet the just\r\nobligations of the Government and the expense of its economical\r\nadministration, such exaction becomes ruthless extortion and a violation of\r\nthe fundamental principles of a free government.\r\n\r\nThe indirect manner in which these exactions are made has a tendency to\r\nconceal their true character and their extent. But we have arrived at a\r\nstage of superfluous revenue which has aroused the people to a realization\r\nof the fact that the amount raised professedly for the support of the\r\nGovernment is paid by them as absolutely if added to the price of the\r\nthings which supply their daily wants as if it was paid at fixed periods\r\ninto the hand of the tax gatherer.\r\n\r\nThose who toil for daily wages are beginning to understand that capital,\r\nthough sometimes vaunting its importance and clamoring for the protection\r\nand favor of the Government, is dull and sluggish till, touched by the\r\nmagical hand of labor, it springs into activity, furnishing an occasion for\r\nFederal taxation and gaining the value which enables it to bear its burden.\r\nAnd the laboring man is thoughtfully inquiring whether in these\r\ncircumstances, and considering the tribute he constantly pays into the\r\npublic Treasury as he supplies his daily wants, he receives his fair share\r\nof advantages.\r\n\r\nThere is also a suspicion abroad that the surplus of our revenues indicates\r\nabnormal and exceptional business profits, which, under the system which\r\nproduces such surplus, increase without corresponding benefit to the people\r\nat large the vast accumulations of a few among our citizens, whose\r\nfortunes, rivaling the wealth of the most favored in antidemocratic\r\nnations, are not the natural growth of a steady, plain, and industrious\r\nrepublic.\r\n\r\nOur farmers, too, and those engaged directly and indirectly in supplying\r\nthe products of agriculture, see that day by day, and as often as the daily\r\nwants of their households recur, they are forced to pay excessive and\r\nneedless taxation, while their products struggle in foreign markets with\r\nthe competition of nations, which, by allowing a freer exchange of\r\nproductions than we permit, enable their people to sell for prices which\r\ndistress the American farmer.\r\n\r\nAs every patriotic citizen rejoices in the constantly increasing pride of\r\nour people in American citizenship and in the glory of our national\r\nachievements and progress, a sentiment prevails that the leading strings\r\nuseful to a nation in its infancy may well be to a great extent discarded\r\nin the present stage of American ingenuity, courage, and fearless\r\nself-reliance; and for the privilege of indulging this sentiment with true\r\nAmerican enthusiasm our citizens are quite willing to forego an idle\r\nsurplus in the public Treasury.\r\n\r\nAnd all the people know that the average rate of Federal taxation upon\r\nimports is to-day, in time of peace, but little less, while upon some\r\narticles of necessary consumption it is actually more, than was imposed by\r\nthe grievous burden willingly borne at a time when the Government needed\r\nmillions to maintain by war the safety and integrity of the Union.\r\n\r\nIt has been the policy of the Government to collect the principal part of\r\nits revenues by a tax upon imports, and no change in this policy is\r\ndesirable. But the present condition of affairs constrains our people to\r\ndemand that by a revision of our revenue laws the receipts of the\r\nGovernment shall be reduced to the necessary expense of its economical\r\nadministration; and this demand should be recognized and obeyed by the\r\npeople's representatives in the legislative branch of the Government.\r\n\r\nIn readjusting the burdens of Federal taxation a sound public policy\r\nrequires that such of our citizens as have built up large and important\r\nindustries under present conditions should not be suddenly and to their\r\ninjury deprived of advantages to which they have adapted their business;\r\nbut if the public good requires it they should be content with such\r\nconsideration as shall deal fairly and cautiously with their interests,\r\nwhile the just demand of the people for relief from needless taxation is\r\nhonestly answered.\r\n\r\nA reasonable and timely submission to such a demand should certainly be\r\npossible without disastrous shock to any interest; and a cheerful\r\nconcession sometimes averts abrupt and heedless action, often the outgrowth\r\nof impatience and delayed justice.\r\n\r\nDue regard should be also accorded in any proposed readjustment to the\r\ninterests of American labor so far as they are involved. We congratulate\r\nourselves that there is among us no laboring class fixed within unyielding\r\nbounds and doomed under all conditions to the inexorable fate of daily\r\ntoil. We recognize in labor a chief factor in the wealth of the Republic,\r\nand we treat those who have it in their keeping as citizens entitled to the\r\nmost careful regard and thoughtful attention. This regard and attention\r\nshould be awarded them, not only because labor is the capital of our\r\nworkingmen, justly entitled to its share of Government favor, but for the\r\nfurther and not less important reason that the laboring man, surrounded by\r\nhis family in his humble home, as a consumer is vitally interested in all\r\nthat cheapens the cost of living and enables him to bring within his\r\ndomestic circle additional comforts and advantages.\r\n\r\nThis relation of the workingman to the revenue laws of the country and the\r\nmanner in which it palpably influences the question of wages should not be\r\nforgotten in the justifiable prominence given to the proper maintenance of\r\nthe supply and protection of well-paid labor. And these considerations\r\nsuggest such an arrangement of Government revenues as shall reduce the\r\nexpense of living, while it does not curtail the opportunity for work nor\r\nreduce the compensation of American labor and injuriously affect its\r\ncondition and the dignified place it holds in the estimation of our\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nBut our farmers and agriculturists--those who from the soil produce the\r\nthings consumed by all--are perhaps more directly and plainly concerned\r\nthan any other of our citizens in a just and careful system of Federal\r\ntaxation. Those actually engaged in and more remotely connected with this\r\nkind of work number nearly one-half of our population. None labor harder or\r\nmore continuously than they. No enactments limit their hours of toil and no\r\ninterposition of the Government enhances to any great extent the value of\r\ntheir products. And yet for many of the necessaries and comforts of life,\r\nwhich the most scrupulous economy enables them to bring into their homes,\r\nand for their implements of husbandry, they are obliged to pay a price\r\nlargely increased by an unnatural profit, which by the action of the\r\nGovernment is given to the more favored manufacturer.\r\n\r\nI recommend that, keeping in view all these considerations, the increasing\r\nand unnecessary surplus of national income annually accumulating be\r\nreleased to the people by an amendment to our revenue laws which shall\r\ncheapen the price of the necessaries of life and give freer entrance to\r\nsuch imported materials as by American labor may be manufactured into\r\nmarketable commodities.\r\n\r\nNothing can be accomplished, however, in the direction of this much-needed\r\nreform unless the subject is approached in a patriotic spirit of devotion\r\nto the interests of the entire country and with a willingness to yield\r\nsomething for the public good.\r\n\r\nThe sum paid upon the public debt during the fiscal year ended June 30,\r\n1886, was $44,551,043.36.\r\n\r\nDuring the twelve months ended October 31,1886, 3 per cent bonds were\r\ncalled for redemption amounting to $127,283,100, of which $80,643,200 was\r\nso called to answer the requirements of the law relating to the sinking\r\nfund and $46,639,900 for the purpose of reducing the public debt by\r\napplication of a part of the surplus in the Treasury to that object. Of the\r\nbonds thus called $102,269,450 became subject under such calls to\r\nredemption prior to November 1, 1886. The remainder, amounting\r\nto $25,013,650, matured under the calls after that date.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the amount subject to payment and cancellation prior to\r\nNovember 1, there were also paid before that day certain of these bonds,\r\nwith the interest thereon, amounting to $5,072,350, which were anticipated\r\nas to their maturity, of which $2,664,850 had not been called, Thus\r\n$107,341,800 had been actually applied prior to the 1st of November, 1886,\r\nto the extinguishment of our bonded and interest-bearing debt, leaving on\r\nthat day still outstanding the sum of $1,153,443,112. Of this amount\r\n$86,848,700 were still represented by 3 per cent bonds. They however, have\r\nbeen since November 1, or will at once be, further reduced by $22,606,150,\r\nbeing bonds which have been called, as already stated, but not redeemed and\r\ncanceled before the latter date.\r\n\r\nDuring the fiscal year ended June 30, 1886, there were coined, under the\r\ncompulsory silver-coinage act of 1878,29,838,905 silver dollars, and the\r\ncost of the silver used in such coinage was $23,448,960.01. There had been\r\ncoined up to the close of the previous fiscal year under the provisions of\r\nthe law 203,882,554 silver dollars, and on the 1st day of December, 1886,\r\nthe total amount of such coinage was $247,131,549.\r\n\r\nThe Director of the Mint reports that at the time of the passage of the law\r\nof 1878 directing this coinage the intrinsic value of the dollars thus\r\ncoined was 94 1/4 cents each, and that on the 31st day of July, 1886, the\r\nprice of silver reached the lowest stage ever known, so that the intrinsic\r\nor bullion price of our standard silver dollar at that date was less than\r\n72 cents. The price of silver on the 30th day of November last was such as\r\nto make these dollars intrinsically worth 78 cents each.\r\n\r\nThese differences in value of the coins represent the fluctuations in the\r\nprice of silver, and they certainly do not indicate that compulsory coinage\r\nby the Government enhances the price of that commodity or secures\r\nuniformity in its value.\r\n\r\nEvery fair and legal effort has been made by the Treasury Department to\r\ndistribute this currency among the people. The withdrawal of United States\r\nTreasury notes of small denominations and the issuing of small silver\r\ncertificates have been resorted to in the endeavor to accomplish this\r\nresult, in obedience to the will and sentiments of the representatives of\r\nthe people in the Congress. On the 27th day of November, 1886, the people\r\nheld of these coins, or certificates representing them, the nominal sum of\r\n$166,873,041, and we still had $79,464,345 in the Treasury as against about\r\n$142,894,055 so in the hands of the people and $72,865,376 remaining in the\r\nTreasury one year ago. The Director of the Mint again urges the necessity\r\nof more vault room for the purpose of storing these silver dollars which\r\nare not needed for circulation by the people.\r\n\r\nI have seen no reason to change the views expressed in my last annual\r\nmessage on the subject of this compulsory coinage, and I again urge its\r\nsuspension on all the grounds contained in my former recommendation,\r\nreenforced by the significant increase of our gold exportations during the\r\nlast year, as appears by the comparative statement herewith presented, and\r\nfor the further reasons that the more this currency is distributed among\r\nthe people the greater becomes our duty to protect it from disaster, that\r\nwe now have abundance for all our needs, and that there seems but little\r\npropriety in building vaults to store such currency when the only pretense\r\nfor its coinage is the necessity of its use by the people as a circulating\r\nmedium.\r\n\r\nThe great number of suits now pending in the United States courts for the\r\nsouthern district of New York growing out of the collection of customs\r\nrevenue at the port of New York and the number of such suits that are\r\nalmost daily instituted are certainly worthy the attention of the Congress.\r\nThese legal controversies, based upon conflicting views by importers and\r\nthe collector as to the interpretation of our present complex and\r\nindefinite revenue laws, might be largely obviated by an amendment of those\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\nBut pending such amendment the present condition of this litigation should\r\nbe relieved. There are now pending about 2,500 of these suits. More than\r\n1,100 have been commenced within the past eighteen months, and many of the\r\nothers have been at issue for more than twenty-five years. These delays\r\nsubject the Government to loss of evidence and prevent the preparation\r\nnecessary to defeat unjust and fictitious claims, while constantly accruing\r\ninterest threatens to double the demands involved.\r\n\r\nIn the present condition of the dockets of the courts, well filled with\r\nprivate suits, and of the force allowed the district attorney, no greater\r\nthan is necessary for the ordinary and current business of his office,\r\nthese revenue litigations can not be considered.\r\n\r\nIn default of the adoption by the Congress of a plan for the general\r\nreorganization of the Federal courts, as has been heretofore recommended, I\r\nurge the propriety of passing a law permitting the appointment of an\r\nadditional Federal judge in the district where these Government suits have\r\naccumulated, so that by continuous sessions of the courts devoted to the\r\ntrial of these cases they may be determined.\r\n\r\nIt is entirely plain that a great saving to the Government would be\r\naccomplished by such a remedy, and the suitors who have honest claims would\r\nnot be denied justice through delay.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War gives a detailed account of the\r\nadministration of his Department and contains sundry recommendations for\r\nthe improvement of the service, which I fully approve.\r\n\r\nThe Army consisted at the date of the last consolidated return of 2,103\r\nofficers and 24,946 enlisted men.\r\n\r\nThe expenses of the Department for the last fiscal year were\r\n$36,990,903.38, including $6,294,305.43 for public works and river and\r\nharbor improvements.\r\n\r\nI especially direct the attention of the Congress to the recommendation\r\nthat officers be required to submit to an examination as a preliminary to\r\ntheir promotion. I see no objection, but many advantages, in adopting this\r\nfeature, which has operated so beneficially in our Navy Department, as well\r\nas in some branches of the Army.\r\n\r\nThe subject of coast defenses and fortifications has been fully and\r\ncarefully treated by the Board on Fortifications, whose report was\r\nsubmitted at the last session of Congress; but no construction work of the\r\nkind recommended by the board has been possible during the last year from\r\nthe lack of appropriations for such purpose.\r\n\r\nThe defenseless condition of our seacoast and lake frontier is perfectly\r\npalpable. The examinations made must convince us all that certain of our\r\ncities named in the report of the board should be fortified and that work\r\non the most important of these fortifications should be commenced at once.\r\nThe work has been thoroughly considered and laid out, the Secretary of War\r\nreports, but all is delayed in default of Congressional action.\r\n\r\nThe absolute necessity, judged by all standards of prudence and foresight,\r\nof our preparation for an effectual resistance against the armored ships\r\nand steel guns and mortars of modern construction which may threaten the\r\ncities on our coasts is so apparent that I hope effective steps will be\r\ntaken in that direction immediately.\r\n\r\nThe valuable and suggestive treatment of this question by the Secretary of\r\nWar is earnestly commended to the consideration of the Congress.\r\n\r\nIn September and October last the hostile Apaches who, under the leadership\r\nof Geronimo, had for eighteen months been on the war path, and during that\r\ntime had committed many murders and been the cause of constant terror to\r\nthe settlers of Arizona, surrendered to General Miles, the military\r\ncommander who succeeded General Crook in the management and direction of\r\ntheir pursuit.\r\n\r\nUnder the terms of their surrender as then reported, and in view of the\r\nunderstanding which these murderous savages seemed to entertain of the\r\nassurances given them, it was considered best to imprison them in such\r\nmanner as to prevent their ever engaging in such outrages again, instead of\r\ntrying them for murder. Fort Pickens having been selected as a safe place\r\nof confinement, all the adult males were sent thither and will be closely\r\nguarded as prisoners. In the meantime the residue of the band, who, though\r\nstill remaining upon the reservation, were regarded as unsafe and suspected\r\nof furnishing aid to those on the war path, had been removed to Fort\r\nMarion. The women and larger children of the hostiles were also taken\r\nthere, and arrangements have been made for putting the children of proper\r\nage in Indian schools.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy contains a detailed exhibit of the\r\ncondition of his Department, with such a statement of the action needed to\r\nimprove the same as should challenge the earnest attention of the\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThe present Navy of the United States, aside from the ships in course of\r\nconstruction, consists of--\r\n\r\nFirst. Fourteen single-turreted monitors, none of which are in commission\r\nnor at the present time serviceable. The batteries of these ships are\r\nobsolete, and they can only be relied upon as auxiliary ships in harbor\r\ndefense, and then after such an expenditure upon them as might not be\r\ndeemed justifiable.\r\n\r\nSecond. Five fourth-rate vessels of small tonnage, only one of which was\r\ndesigned as a war vessel, and all of which are auxiliary merely.\r\n\r\nThird. Twenty-seven cruising ships, three of which are built of iron, of\r\nsmall tonnage, and twenty-four of wood. Of these wooden vessels it is\r\nestimated by the Chief Constructor of the Navy that only three will be\r\nserviceable beyond a period of six years, at which time it may be said that\r\nof the present naval force nothing worthy the name will remain.\r\n\r\nAll the vessels heretofore authorized are under contract or in course of\r\nconstruction except the armored ships, the torpedo and dynamite boats, and\r\none cruiser. As to the last of these, the bids were in excess of the limit\r\nfixed by Congress. The production in the United States of armor and gun\r\nsteel is a question which it seems necessary to settle at an early day if\r\nthe armored war vessels are to be completed with those materials of home\r\nmanufacture. This has been the subject of investigation by two boards and\r\nby two special committees of Congress within the last three years. The\r\nreport of the Gun Foundry Board in 1884, of the Board on Fortifications\r\nmade in January last, and the reports of the select committees of the two\r\nHouses made at the last session of Congress have entirely exhausted the\r\nsubject, so far as preliminary investigation is involved, and in their\r\nrecommendations they are substantially agreed.\r\n\r\nIn the event that the present invitation of the Department for bids to\r\nfurnish such of this material as is now authorized shall fail to induce\r\ndomestic manufacturers to undertake the large expenditures required to\r\nprepare for this new manufacture, and no other steps are taken by Congress\r\nat its coming session, the Secretary contemplates with dissatisfaction the\r\nnecessity of obtaining abroad the armor and the gun steel for the\r\nauthorized ships. It would seem desirable that the wants of the Army and\r\nthe Navy in this regard should be reasonably met, and that by uniting their\r\ncontracts such inducement might be offered as would result in securing the\r\ndomestication of these important interests.\r\n\r\nThe affairs of the postal service show marked and gratifying improvement\r\nduring the past year. A particular account of its transactions and\r\ncondition is given in the report of the Postmaster-General, which will be\r\nlaid before you.\r\n\r\nThe reduction of the rate of letter postage in 1883, rendering the postal\r\nrevenues inadequate to sustain the expenditures, and business depression\r\nalso contributing, resulted in an excess of cost for the fiscal year ended\r\nJune 30, 1885, of eight and one-third millions of dollars. An additional\r\ncheck upon receipts by doubling the measure of weight in rating sealed\r\ncorrespondence and diminishing one-half the charge for newspaper carriage\r\nwas imposed by legislation which took effect with the beginning of the past\r\nfiscal year, while the constant demand of our territorial development and\r\ngrowing population for the extension and increase of mail facilities and\r\nmachinery necessitates steady annual advance in outlay, and the careful\r\nestimate of a year ago upon the rates of expenditure then existing\r\ncontemplated the unavoidable augmentation of the deficiency in the last\r\nfiscal year by nearly $2,000,000. The anticipated revenue for the last year\r\nfailed of realization by about $64,000, but proper measures of economy have\r\nso satisfactorily limited the growth of expenditure that the total\r\ndeficiency in fact fell below that of 1885, and at this time the increase\r\nof revenue is in a gaining ratio over the increase of cost, demonstrating\r\nthe sufficiency of the present rates of postage ultimately to sustain the\r\nservice. This is the more pleasing because our people enjoy now both\r\ncheaper postage proportionably to distances and a vaster and more costly\r\nservice than any other upon the globe.\r\n\r\nRetrenchment has been effected in the cost of supplies, some expenditures\r\nunwarranted by law have ceased, and the outlays for mail carriage have been\r\nsubjected to beneficial scrutiny. At the close of the last fiscal year the\r\nexpense of transportation on star routes stood at an annual rate of cost\r\nless by over $560,000 than at the close of the previous year and steamboat\r\nand mail-messenger service at nearly $200,000 less.\r\n\r\nThe service has been in the meantime enlarged and extended by the\r\nestablishment of new offices, increase of routes of carriage, expansion of\r\ncarrier-delivery conveniences, and additions to the railway mail\r\nfacilities, in accordance with the growing exigencies of the country and\r\nthe long-established policy of the Government.\r\n\r\nThe Postmaster-General calls attention to the existing law for compensating\r\nrailroads and expresses the opinion that a method may be devised which will\r\nprove more just to the carriers and beneficial to the Government; and the\r\nsubject appears worthy of your early consideration.\r\n\r\nThe differences which arose during the year with certain of the ocean\r\nsteamship companies have terminated by the acquiescence of all in the\r\npolicy of the Government approved by the Congress in the postal\r\nappropriation at its last session, and the Department now enjoys the utmost\r\nservice afforded by all vessels which sail from our ports upon either\r\nocean--a service generally adequate to the needs of our intercourse.\r\nPetitions have, however, been presented to the Department by numerous\r\nmerchants and manufacturers for the establishment of a direct service to\r\nthe Argentine Republic and for semimonthly dispatches to the Empire of\r\nBrazil, and the subject is commended to your consideration. It is an\r\nobvious duty to provide the means of postal communication which our\r\ncommerce requires, and with prudent forecast of results the wise extension\r\nof it may lead to stimulating intercourse and become the harbinger of a\r\nprofitable traffic which will open new avenues for the disposition of the\r\nproducts of our industry. The circumstances of the countries at the far\r\nsouth of our continent are such as to invite our enterprise and afford the\r\npromise of sufficient advantages to justify an unusual effort to bring\r\nabout the closer relations which greater freedom of communication would\r\ntend to establish.\r\n\r\nI suggest that, as distinguished from a grant or subsidy for the mere\r\nbenefit of any line of trade or travel, whatever outlay may be required to\r\nsecure additional postal service, necessary and proper and not otherwise\r\nattainable, should be regarded as within the limit of legitimate\r\ncompensation for such service.\r\n\r\nThe extension of the free-delivery service as suggested by the\r\nPostmaster-General has heretofore received my sanction, and it is to be\r\nhoped a suitable enactment may soon be agreed upon.\r\n\r\nThe request for an appropriation sufficient to enable the general\r\ninspection of fourth-class offices has my approbation.\r\n\r\nI renew my approval of the recommendation of the Postmaster-General that\r\nanother assistant be provided for the Post-Office Department, and I invite\r\nyour attention to the several other recommendations in his report.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of the Department of Justice for the last fiscal year is fully\r\ndetailed in the report of the Attorney-General, and I invite the earnest\r\nattention of the Congress to the same and due consideration of the\r\nrecommendations therein contained.\r\n\r\nIn the report submitted by this officer to the last session of the Congress\r\nhe strongly recommended the erection of a penitentiary for the confinement\r\nof prisoners convicted and sentenced in the United States courts, and he\r\nrepeats the recommendation in his report for the last year.\r\n\r\nThis is a matter of very great importance and should at once receive\r\nCongressional action. United States prisoners are now confined in more than\r\nthirty different State prisons and penitentiaries scattered in every part\r\nof the country. They are subjected to nearly as many different modes of\r\ntreatment and discipline and are far too much removed from the control and\r\nregulation of the Government. So far as they are entitled to humane\r\ntreatment and an opportunity for improvement and reformation, the\r\nGovernment is responsible to them and society that these things are\r\nforthcoming. But this duty can scarcely be discharged without more absolute\r\ncontrol and direction than is possible under the present system.\r\n\r\nMany of our good citizens have interested themselves, with the most\r\nbeneficial results, in the question of prison reform. The General\r\nGovernment should be in a situation, since there must be United States\r\nprisoners, to furnish important aid in this movement, and should be able to\r\nillustrate what may be practically done in the direction of this reform and\r\nto present an example in the treatment and improvement of its prisoners\r\nworthy of imitation.\r\n\r\nWith prisons under its own control the Government could deal with the\r\nsomewhat vexed question of convict labor, so far as its convicts were\r\nconcerned, according to a plan of its own adoption, and with due regard to\r\nthe rights and interests of our laboring citizens, instead of sometimes\r\naiding in the operation of a system which causes among them irritation and\r\ndiscontent.\r\n\r\nUpon consideration of this subject it might be thought wise to erect more\r\nthan one of these institutions, located in such places as would best\r\nsubserve the purposes of convenience and economy in transportation. The\r\nconsiderable cost of maintaining these convicts as at present, in State\r\ninstitutions, would be saved by the adoption of the plan proposed, and by\r\nemploying them in the manufacture of such articles as were needed for use\r\nby the Government quite a large pecuniary benefit would be realized in\r\npartial return for our outlay.\r\n\r\nI again urge a change in the Federal judicial system to meet the wants of\r\nthe people and obviate the delays necessarily attending the present\r\ncondition of affairs in our courts. All are agreed that something should be\r\ndone, and much favor is shown by those well able to advise to the plan\r\nsuggested by the Attorney-General at the last session of the Congress and\r\nrecommended in my last annual message. This recommendation is here renewed,\r\ntogether with another made at the same time, touching a change in the\r\nmanner of compensating district attorneys and marshals; and the latter\r\nsubject is commended to the Congress for its action in the interest of\r\neconomy to the Government, and humanity, fairness, and justice to our\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Interior presents a comprehensive\r\nsummary of the work of the various branches of the public service connected\r\nwith his Department, and the suggestions and recommendations which it\r\ncontains for the improvement of the service should receive your careful\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nThe exhibit made of the condition of our Indian population and the progress\r\nof the work for their enlightenment, notwithstanding the many\r\nembarrassments which hinder the better administration of this important\r\nbranch of the service, is a gratifying and hopeful one.\r\n\r\nThe funds appropriated for the Indian service for the fiscal year just\r\npassed, with the available income from Indian land and trust moneys,\r\namounting in all to $7,850,775.12, were ample for the service under the\r\nconditions and restrictions of laws regulating their expenditure. There\r\nremained a balance on hand on June 30, 1886, of $1,660,023.30, of which $\r\n1,337,768.21 are permanent funds for fulfillment of treaties and other like\r\npurposes, and the remainder, $322,255.09, is subject to be carried to the\r\nsurplus fund as required by law.\r\n\r\nThe estimates presented for appropriations for the ensuing fiscal year\r\namount to $5,608,873.64, or $442,386.20 less than those laid before the\r\nCongress last year.\r\n\r\nThe present system of agencies, while absolutely necessary and well adapted\r\nfor the management of our Indian affairs and for the ends in view when it\r\nwas adopted, is in the present stage of Indian management inadequate,\r\nstanding alone, for the accomplishment of an object which has become\r\npressing in its importance--the more rapid transition from tribal\r\norganizations to citizenship of such portions of the Indians as are capable\r\nof civilized life.\r\n\r\nWhen the existing system was adopted, the Indian race was outside of the\r\nlimits of organized States and Territories and beyond the immediate reach\r\nand operation of civilization, and all efforts were mainly directed to the\r\nmaintenance of friendly relations and the preservation of peace and quiet\r\non the frontier. All this is now changed. There is no such thing as the\r\nIndian frontier. Civilization, with the busy hum of industry and the\r\ninfluences of Christianity, surrounds these people at every point. None of\r\nthe tribes are outside of the bounds of organized government and society,\r\nexcept that the Territorial system has not been extended over that portion\r\nof the country known as the Indian Territory. As a race the Indians are no\r\nlonger hostile, but may be considered as submissive to the control of the\r\nGovernment. Few of them only are troublesome. Except the fragments of\r\nseveral bands, all are now gathered upon reservations.\r\n\r\nIt is no longer possible for them to subsist by the chase and the\r\nspontaneous productions of the earth.\r\n\r\nWith an abundance of land, if furnished with the means and implements for\r\nprofitable husbandry, their life of entire dependence upon Government\r\nrations from day to day is no longer defensible. Their inclination, long\r\nfostered by a defective system of control, is to cling to the habits and\r\ncustoms of their ancestors and struggle with persistence against the change\r\nof life which their altered circumstances press upon them. But barbarism\r\nand civilization can not live together. It is impossible that such\r\nincongruous conditions should coexist on the same soil.\r\n\r\nThey are a portion of our people, are under the authority of our\r\nGovernment, and have a peculiar claim upon and are entitled to the\r\nfostering care and protection of the nation. The Government can not relieve\r\nitself of this responsibility until they are so far trained and civilized\r\nas to be able wholly to manage and care for themselves. The paths in which\r\nthey should walk must be clearly marked out for them, and they must be led\r\nor guided until they are familiar with the way and competent to assume the\r\nduties and responsibilities of our citizenship.\r\n\r\nProgress in this great work will continue only at the present slow pace and\r\nat great expense unless the system and methods of management are improved\r\nto meet the changed conditions and urgent demands of the service.\r\n\r\nThe agents, having general charge and supervision in many cases of more\r\nthan 5,000 Indians, scattered over large reservations, and burdened with\r\nthe details of accountability for funds and supplies, have time to look\r\nafter the industrial training and improvement of a few Indians only. The\r\nmany are neglected and remain idle and dependent, conditions not favorable\r\nfor progress and civilization.\r\n\r\nThe compensation allowed these agents and the conditions of the service are\r\nnot calculated to secure for the work men who are fitted by ability and\r\nskill to properly plan and intelligently direct the methods best adapted to\r\nproduce the most speedy results and permanent benefits.\r\n\r\nHence the necessity for a supplemental agency or system directed to the end\r\nof promoting the general and more rapid transition of the tribes from\r\nhabits and customs of barbarism to the ways of civilization.\r\n\r\nWith an anxious desire to devise some plan of operation by which to secure\r\nthe welfare of the Indians and to relieve the Treasury as far as possible\r\nfrom the support of an idle and dependent population, I recommended in my\r\nprevious annual message the passage of a law authorizing the appointment of\r\na commission as an instrumentality auxiliary to those already established\r\nfor the care of the Indians. It was designed that this commission should be\r\ncomposed of six intelligent and capable persons--three to be detailed from\r\nthe Army--having practical ideas upon the subject of the treatment of\r\nIndians and interested in their welfare, and that it should be charged,\r\nunder the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, with the management\r\nof such matters of detail as can not with the present organization be\r\nproperly and successfully conducted, and which present different phases, as\r\nthe Indians themselves differ in their progress, needs, disposition, and\r\ncapacity for improvement or immediate self-support.\r\n\r\nBy the aid of such a commission much unwise and useless expenditure of\r\nmoney, waste of materials, and unavailing efforts might be avoided; and it\r\nis hoped that this or some measure which the wisdom of Congress may better\r\ndevise to supply the deficiency of the present system may receive your\r\nconsideration and the appropriate legislation be provided.\r\n\r\nThe time is ripe for the work of such an agency.\r\n\r\nThere is less opposition to the education and training of the Indian youth,\r\nas shown by the increased attendance upon the schools, and there is a\r\nyielding tendency for the individual holding of lands. Development and\r\nadvancement in these directions are essential, and should have every\r\nencouragement. As the rising generation are taught the language of\r\ncivilization and trained in habits of industry they should assume the\r\nduties, privileges, and responsibilities of citizenship.\r\n\r\nNo obstacle should hinder the location and settlement of any Indian willing\r\nto take land in severalty; on the contrary, the inclination to do so should\r\nbe stimulated at all times when proper and expedient. But there is no\r\nauthority of law for making allotments on some of the reservations, and on\r\nothers the allotments provided for are so small that the Indians, though\r\nready and desiring to settle down, are not willing to accept such small\r\nareas when their reservations contain ample lands to afford them homesteads\r\nof sufficient size to meet their present and future needs.\r\n\r\nThese inequalities of existing special laws and treaties should be\r\ncorrected and some general legislation on the subject should be provided,\r\nso that the more progressive members of the different tribes may be settled\r\nupon homesteads, and by their example lead others to follow, breaking away\r\nfrom tribal customs and substituting therefor the love of home, the\r\ninterest of the family, and the rule of the state.\r\n\r\nThe Indian character and nature are such that they are not easily led while\r\nbrooding over unadjusted wrongs. This is especially so regarding their\r\nlands. Matters arising from the construction and operation of railroads\r\nacross some of the reservations, and claims of title and right of occupancy\r\nset up by white persons to some of the best land within other reservations\r\nrequire legislation for their final adjustment.\r\n\r\nThe settlement of these matters will remove many embarrassments to progress\r\nin the work of leading the Indians to the adoption of our institutions and\r\nbringing them under the operation, the influence, and the protection of the\r\nuniversal laws of our country.\r\n\r\nThe recommendations of the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner\r\nof the General Land Office looking to the better protection of public lands\r\nand of the public surveys, the preservation of national forests, the\r\nadjudication of grants to States and corporations and of private land\r\nclaims, and the increased efficiency of the public-land service are\r\ncommended to the attention of Congress. To secure the widest distribution\r\nof public lands in limited quantities among settlers for residence and\r\ncultivation, and thus make the greatest number of individual homes, was the\r\nprimary object of the public-land legislation in the early days of the\r\nRepublic. This system was a simple one. It commenced with an admirable\r\nscheme of public surveys, by which the humblest citizen could identify the\r\ntract upon which he wished to establish his home. The price of lands was\r\nplaced within the reach of all the enterprising, industrious, and honest\r\npioneer citizens of the country. It was soon, however, found that the\r\nobject of the laws was perverted, under the system of cash sales, from a\r\ndistribution of land among the people to an accumulation of land capital by\r\nwealthy and speculative persons. To check this tendency a preference right\r\nof purchase was given to settlers on the land, a plan which culminated in\r\nthe general preemption act of 1841. The foundation of this system was\r\nactual residence and cultivation. Twenty years later the homestead law was\r\ndevised to more surely place actual homes in the possession of actual\r\ncultivators of the soil. The land was given without price, the sole\r\nconditions being residence, improvement, and cultivation. Other laws have\r\nfollowed, each designed to encourage the acquirement and use of land in\r\nlimited individual quantities. But in later years these laws, through\r\nvicious administrative methods and under changed conditions of\r\ncommunication and transportation, have been so evaded and violated that\r\ntheir beneficent purpose is threatened with entire defeat. The methods of\r\nsuch evasions and violations are set forth in detail in the reports of the\r\nSecretary of the Interior and Commissioner of the General Land Office. The\r\nrapid appropriation of our public lands without bona fide settlements or\r\ncultivation, and not only without intention of residence, but for the\r\npurpose of their aggregation in large holdings, in many cases in the hands\r\nof foreigners, invites the serious and immediate attention of the\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThe energies of the Land Department have been devoted during the present\r\nAdministration to remedy defects and correct abuses in the public-land\r\nservice. The results of these efforts are so largely in the nature of\r\nreforms in the processes and methods of our land system as to prevent\r\nadequate estimate; but it appears by a compilation from the reports of the\r\nCommissioner of the General Land Office that the immediate effect in\r\nleading cases which have come to a final termination has been the\r\nrestoration to the mass of public lands of 2,750,000 acres; that 2,370,000\r\nacres are embraced in investigations now pending before the Department or\r\nthe courts, and that the action of Congress has been asked to effect the\r\nrestoration of 2,790,000 acres additional; besides which 4,000,000 acres\r\nhave been withheld from reservation and the rights of entry thereon\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\nI recommend the repeal of the preemption and timber-culture acts, and that\r\nthe homestead laws be so amended as to better secure compliance with their\r\nrequirements of residence, improvement, and cultivation for the period of\r\nfive years from date of entry, without commutation or provision for\r\nspeculative relinquishment. I also recommend the repeal of the desert-land\r\nlaws unless it shall be the pleasure of the Congress to so amend these laws\r\nas to render them less liable to abuses. As the chief motive for an evasion\r\nof the laws and the principal cause of their result in land accumulation\r\ninstead of land distribution is the facility with which transfers are made\r\nof the right intended to be secured to settlers, it may be deemed advisable\r\nto provide by legislation some guards and checks upon the alienation of\r\nhomestead rights and lands covered thereby until patents issue.\r\n\r\nLast year an Executive proclamation was issued directing the removal of\r\nfences which inclosed the public domain. Many of these have been removed in\r\nobedience to such order, but much of the public land still remains within\r\nthe lines of these unlawful fences. The ingenious methods resorted to in\r\norder to continue these trespasses and the hardihood of the pretenses by\r\nwhich in some cases such inclosures are justified are fully detailed in the\r\nreport of the Secretary of the Interior.\r\n\r\nThe removal of the fences still remaining which inclose public lands will\r\nbe enforced with all the authority and means with which the executive\r\nbranch of the Government is or shall be invested by the Congress for that\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Commissioner of Pensions contains a detailed and most\r\nsatisfactory exhibit of the operations of the Pension Bureau during the\r\nlast fiscal year. The amount of work done was the largest in any year since\r\nthe organization of the Bureau, and it has been done at less cost than\r\nduring the previous year in every division.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th day of June, 1886, there were 365,783 pensioners on the rolls\r\nof the Bureau.\r\n\r\nSince 1861 there have been 1,018,735 applications for pensions filed, of\r\nwhich 78,834 were based upon service in the War of 1812. There were 621,754\r\nof these applications allowed, including 60,178 to the soldiers of 1812 and\r\ntheir widows.\r\n\r\nThe total amount paid for pensions since 1861 is $808,624,811.57.\r\n\r\nThe number of new pensions allowed during the year ended June 30, 1886, is\r\n40,857, a larger number than has been allowed in any year save one since\r\n1861. The names of 2,229 pensioners which had been previously dropped from\r\nthe rolls were restored during the year, and after deducting those dropped\r\nwithin the same time for various causes a net increase remains for the year\r\nof 20,658 names.\r\n\r\nFrom January 1, 1861, to December 1, 1885, 1,967 private pension acts had\r\nbeen passed. Since the last-mentioned date, and during the last session of\r\nthe Congress, 644 such acts became laws.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that no one can examine our pension establishment and its\r\noperations without being convinced that through its instrumentality justice\r\ncan be very nearly done to all who are entitled under present laws to the\r\npension bounty of the Government.\r\n\r\nBut it is undeniable that cases exist, well entitled to relief, in which\r\nthe Pension Bureau is powerless to aid. The really worthy cases of this\r\nclass are such as only lack by misfortune the kind or quantity of proof\r\nwhich the law and regulations of the Bureau require, or which, though their\r\nmerit is apparent, for some other reason can not be justly dealt with\r\nthrough general laws. These conditions fully justify application to the\r\nCongress and special enactments. But resort to the Congress for a special\r\npension act to overrule the deliberate and careful determination of the\r\nPension Bureau on the merits or to secure favorable action when it could\r\nnot be expected under the most liberal execution of general laws, it must\r\nbe admitted opens the door to the allowance of questionable claims and\r\npresents to the legislative and executive branches of the Government\r\napplications concededly not within the law and plainly devoid of merit, but\r\nso surrounded by sentiment and patriotic feeling that they are hard to\r\nresist. I suppose it will not be denied that many claims for pension are\r\nmade without merit and that many have been allowed upon fraudulent\r\nrepresentations. This has been declared from the Pension Bureau, not only\r\nin this but in prior Administrations.\r\n\r\nThe usefulness and the justice of any system for the distribution of\r\npensions depend upon the equality and uniformity of its operation.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the report of the Commissioner that there are now paid\r\nby the Government 131 different rates of pension.\r\n\r\nHe estimates from the best information he can obtain that 9,000 of those\r\nwho have served in the Army and Navy of the United States are now\r\nsupported, in whole or in part, from public funds or by organized\r\ncharities, exclusive of those in soldiers' homes under the direction and\r\ncontrol of the Government. Only 13 per cent of these are pensioners, while\r\nof the entire number of men furnished for the late war something like 20\r\nper cent, including their widows and relatives, have been or now are in\r\nreceipt of pensions.\r\n\r\nThe American people, with a patriotic and grateful regard for our\r\nex-soldiers, too broad and too sacred to be monopolized by any special\r\nadvocates, are not only willing but anxious that equal and exact justice\r\nshould be done to all honest claimants for pensions. In their sight the\r\nfriendless and destitute soldier, dependent on public charity, if otherwise\r\nentitled, has precisely the same right to share in the provision made for\r\nthose who fought their country's battles as those better able, through\r\nfriends and influence, to push their claims. Every pension that is granted\r\nunder our present plan upon any other grounds than actual service and\r\ninjury or disease incurred in such service, and every instance of the many\r\nin which pensions are increased on other grounds than the merits of the\r\nclaim, work an injustice to the brave and crippled, but poor and\r\nfriendless, soldier, who is entirely neglected or who must be content with\r\nthe smallest sum allowed under general laws.\r\n\r\nThere are far too many neighborhoods in which are found glaring cases of\r\ninequality of treatment in the matter of pensions, and they are largely due\r\nto a yielding in the Pension Bureau to importunity on the part of those,\r\nother than the pensioner, who are especially interested, or they arise from\r\nspecial acts passed for the benefit of individuals.\r\n\r\nThe men who fought side by side should stand side by side when they\r\nparticipate in a grateful nation's kind remembrance.\r\n\r\nEvery consideration of fairness and justice to our ex-soldiers and the\r\nprotection of the patriotic instinct of our citizens from perversion and\r\nviolation point to the adoption of a pension system broad and comprehensive\r\nenough to cover every contingency, and which shall make unnecessary an\r\nobjectionable volume of special legislation.\r\n\r\nAs long as we adhere to the principle of granting pensions for service, and\r\ndisability as the result of the service, the allowance of pensions should\r\nbe restricted to cases presenting these features.\r\n\r\nEvery patriotic heart responds to a tender consideration for those who,\r\nhaving served their country long and well, are reduced to destitution and\r\ndependence, not as an incident of their service, but with advancing age or\r\nthrough sickness or misfortune. We are all tempted by the contemplation of\r\nsuch a condition to supply relief, and are often impatient of the\r\nlimitations of public duty. Yielding to no one in the desire to indulge\r\nthis feeling of consideration, I can not rid myself of the conviction that\r\nif these ex-soldiers are to be relieved they and their cause are entitled\r\nto the benefit of an enactment under which relief may be claimed as a\r\nright, and that such relief should be granted under the sanction of law,\r\nnot in evasion of it; nor should such worthy objects of care, all equally\r\nentitled, be remitted to the unequal operation of sympathy or the tender\r\nmercies of social and political influence, with their unjust\r\ndiscriminations.\r\n\r\nThe discharged soldiers and sailors of the country are our fellow-citizens,\r\nand interested with us in the passage and faithful execution of wholesome\r\nlaws. They can not be swerved from their duty of citizenship by artful\r\nappeals to their spirit of brotherhood born of common peril and suffering,\r\nnor will they exact as a test of devotion to their welfare a willingness to\r\nneglect public duty in their behalf.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of March, 1885, the current business of the Patent Office was,\r\non an average, five and a half months in arrears, and in several divisions\r\nmore than twelve months behind. At the close of the last fiscal year such\r\ncurrent work was but three months in arrears, and it is asserted and\r\nbelieved that in the next few months the delay in obtaining an examination\r\nof an application for a patent will be but nominal.\r\n\r\nThe number of applications for patents during the last fiscal year,\r\nincluding reissues, designs, trade-marks, and labels, equals 40,678, which\r\nis considerably in excess of the number received during any preceding\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe receipts of the Patent Office during the year aggregate $1,205,167.80,\r\nenabling the office to turn into the Treasury a surplus revenue, over and\r\nabove all expenditures, of about $163,710.30.\r\n\r\nThe number of patents granted during the last fiscal year, including\r\nreissues, trade-marks, designs, and labels, was 25,619, a number also quite\r\nlargely in excess of that of any preceding year.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Commissioner shows the office to be in a prosperous\r\ncondition and constantly increasing in its business. No increase of force\r\nis asked for.\r\n\r\nThe amount estimated for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1886, was\r\n$890,760. The amount estimated for the year ending June 30, 1887, was\r\n$853,960. The amount estimated for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1888, is\r\n$778,770.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Interior suggests a change in the plan for the payment\r\nof the indebtedness of the Pacific subsidized roads to the Government. His\r\nsuggestion has the unanimous indorsement of the persons selected by the\r\nGovernment to act as directors of these roads and protect the interests of\r\nthe United States in the board of direction. In considering the plan\r\nproposed the sole matters which should be taken into account, in my\r\nopinion, are the situation of the Government as a creditor and the surest\r\nway to secure the payment of the principal and interest of its debt.\r\n\r\nBy a recent decision of the Supreme Court of the United States it has been\r\nadjudged that the laws of the several States are inoperative to regulate\r\nrates of transportation upon railroads if such regulation interferes with\r\nthe rate of carriage from one State into another. This important field of\r\ncontrol and regulation having been thus left entirely unoccupied, the\r\nexpediency of Federal action upon the subject is worthy of consideration.\r\n\r\nThe relations of labor to capital and of laboring men to their employers\r\nare of the utmost concern to every patriotic citizen. When these are\r\nstrained and distorted, unjustifiable claims are apt to be insisted upon by\r\nboth interests, and in the controversy which results the welfare of all and\r\nthe prosperity of the country are jeopardized. Any intervention of the\r\nGeneral Government, within the limits of its constitutional authority, to\r\navert such a condition should be willingly accorded.\r\n\r\nIn a special message transmitted to the Congress at its last session I\r\nsuggested the enlargement of our present Labor Bureau and adding to its\r\npresent functions the power of arbitration in cases where differences arise\r\nbetween employer and employed. When these differences reach such a stage as\r\nto result in the interruption of commerce between the States, the\r\napplication of this remedy by the General Government might be regarded as\r\nentirely within its constitutional powers. And I think we might reasonably\r\nhope that such arbitrators, if carefully selected and if entitled to the\r\nconfidence of the parties to be affected, would be voluntarily called to\r\nthe settlement of controversies of less extent and not necessarily within\r\nthe domain of Federal regulation.\r\n\r\nI am of the opinion that this suggestion is worthy the attention of the\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nBut after all has been done by the passage of laws, either Federal or\r\nState, to relieve a situation full of solicitude, much more remains to be\r\naccomplished by the reinstatement and cultivation of a true American\r\nsentiment which recognizes the equality of American citizenship. This, in\r\nthe light of our traditions and in loyalty to the spirit of our\r\ninstitutions, would teach that a hearty cooperation on the part of all\r\ninterests is the surest path to national greatness and the happiness of all\r\nour people; that capital should, in recognition of the brotherhood of our\r\ncitizenship and in a spirit of American fairness, generously accord to\r\nlabor its just compensation and consideration, and that contented labor is\r\ncapital's best protection and faithful ally. It would teach, too, that the\r\ndiverse situations of our people are inseparable from our civilization;\r\nthat every citizen should in his sphere be a contributor to the general\r\ngood; that capital does not necessarily tend to the oppression of labor,\r\nand that violent disturbances and disorders alienate from their promoters\r\ntrue American sympathy and kindly feeling.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Agriculture, representing the oldest and largest of our\r\nnational industries, is subserving well the purposes of its organization.\r\nBy the introduction of new subjects of farming enterprise and by opening\r\nnew sources of agricultural wealth and the dissemination of early\r\ninformation concerning production and prices it has contributed largely to\r\nthe country's prosperity. Through this agency advanced thought and\r\ninvestigation touching the subjects it has in charge should, among other\r\nthings, be practically applied to the home production at a low cost of\r\narticles of food which are now imported from abroad. Such an innovation\r\nwill necessarily, of course, in the beginning be within the domain of\r\nintelligent experiment, and the subject in every stage should receive all\r\npossible encouragement from the Government.\r\n\r\nThe interests of millions of our citizens engaged in agriculture are\r\ninvolved in an enlargement and improvement of the results of their labor,\r\nand a zealous regard for their welfare should be a willing tribute to those\r\nwhose productive returns are a main source of our progress and power.\r\n\r\nThe existence of pleuro-pneumonia among the cattle of various States has\r\nled to burdensome and in some cases disastrous restrictions in an important\r\nbranch of our commerce, threatening to affect the quantity and quality of\r\nour food supply. This is a matter of such importance and of such\r\nfar-reaching consequences that I hope it will engage the serious attention\r\nof the Congress, to the end that such a remedy may be applied as the limits\r\nof a constitutional delegation of power to the General Government will\r\npermit.\r\n\r\nI commend to the consideration of the Congress the report of the\r\nCommissioner and his suggestions concerning the interest intrusted to his\r\ncare.\r\n\r\nThe continued operation of the law relating to our civil service has added\r\nthe most convincing proofs of its necessity and usefulness. It is a fact\r\nworthy of note that every public officer who has a just idea of his duty to\r\nthe people testifies to the value of this reform. Its staunchest, friends\r\nare found among those who understand it best, and its warmest supporters\r\nare those who are restrained and protected by its requirements.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of such restraint and protection is not appreciated by those\r\nwho want places under the Government regardless of merit and efficiency,\r\nnor by those who insist that the selection of such places should rest upon\r\na proper credential showing active partisan work. They mean to public\r\nofficers, if not their lives, the only opportunity afforded them to attend\r\nto public business, and they mean to the good people of the country the\r\nbetter performance of the work of their Government.\r\n\r\nIt is exceedingly strange that the scope and nature of this reform are so\r\nlittle understood and that so many things not included within its plan are\r\ncalled by its name. When cavil yields more fully to examination, the system\r\nwill have large additions to the number of its friends.\r\n\r\nOur civil-service reform may be imperfect in some of its details; it may be\r\nmisunderstood and opposed; it may not always be faithfully applied; its\r\ndesigns may sometimes miscarry through mistake or willful intent; it may\r\nsometimes tremble under the assaults of its enemies or languish under the\r\nmisguided zeal of impracticable friends; but if the people of this country\r\never submit to the banishment of its underlying principle from the\r\noperation of their Government they will abandon the surest guaranty of the\r\nsafety and success of American institutions.\r\n\r\nI invoke for this reform the cheerful and ungrudging support of the\r\nCongress. I renew my recommendation made last year that the salaries of the\r\nCommissioners be made equal to other officers of the Government having like\r\nduties and responsibilities, and I hope that such reasonable appropriations\r\nmay be made as will enable them to increase the usefulness of the cause\r\nthey have in charge.\r\n\r\nI desire to call the attention of the Congress to a plain duty which the\r\nGovernment owes to the depositors in the Freedman's Savings and Trust\r\nCompany.\r\n\r\nThis company was chartered by the Congress for the benefit of the most\r\nilliterate and humble of our people, and with the intention of encouraging\r\nin them industry and thrift. Most of its branches were presided over by\r\nofficers holding the commissions and clothed in the uniform of the United\r\nStates. These and other circumstances reasonably, I think, led these simple\r\npeople to suppose that the invitation to deposit their hard-earned savings\r\nin this institution implied an undertaking on the part of their Government\r\nthat their money should be safely kept for them.\r\n\r\nWhen this company failed, it was liable in the sum of $2,939,925.22 to\r\n61,131 depositors. Dividends amounting in the aggregate to 62 per cent have\r\nbeen declared, and the sum called for and paid of such dividends seems to\r\nbe $1,648,181.72. This sum deducted from the entire amount of deposits\r\nleaves $1,291,744.50 still unpaid. Past experience has shown that quite a\r\nlarge part of this sum will not be called for. There are assets still on\r\nhand amounting to the estimated sum of $16,000.\r\n\r\nI think the remaining 38 per cent of such of these deposits as have\r\nclaimants should be paid by the Government, upon principles of equity and\r\nfairness.\r\n\r\nThe report of the commissioner, soon to be laid before Congress, will give\r\nmore satisfactory details on this subject.\r\n\r\nThe control of the affairs of the District of Columbia having been placed\r\nin the hands of purely executive officers, while the Congress still retains\r\nall legislative authority relating to its government, it becomes my duty to\r\nmake known the most pressing needs of the District and recommend their\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nThe laws of the District appear to be in an uncertain and unsatisfactory\r\ncondition, and their codification or revision is much needed.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year one of the bridges leading from the District to the\r\nState of Virginia became unfit for use, and travel upon it was forbidden.\r\nThis leads me to suggest that the improvement of all the bridges crossing\r\nthe Potomac and its branches from the city of Washington is worthy the\r\nattention of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners of the District represent that the laws regulating the\r\nsale of liquor and granting licenses therefor should be at once amended,\r\nand that legislation is needed to consolidate, define, and enlarge the\r\nscope and powers of charitable and penal institutions within the District.\r\n\r\nI suggest that the Commissioners be clothed with the power to make, within\r\nfixed limitations, police regulations. I believe this power granted and\r\ncarefully guarded would tend to subserve the good order of the\r\nmunicipality.\r\n\r\nIt seems that trouble still exists growing out of the occupation of the\r\nstreets and avenues by certain railroads having their termini in the city.\r\nIt is very important that such laws should be enacted upon this subject as\r\nwill secure to the railroads all the facilities they require for the\r\ntransaction of their business and at the same time protect citizens from\r\ninjury to their persons or property.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners again complain that the accommodations afforded them for\r\nthe necessary offices for District business and for the safe-keeping of\r\nvaluable books and papers are entirely insufficient. I recommend that this\r\ncondition of affairs be remedied by the Congress, and that suitable\r\nquarters be furnished for the needs of the District government.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I earnestly invoke such wise action on the part of the\r\npeople's legislators as will subserve the public good and demonstrate\r\nduring the remaining days of the Congress as at present organized its\r\nability and inclination to so meet the people's needs that it shall be\r\ngratefully remembered by an expectant constituency.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nGrover Cleveland\r\nDecember 6, 1887\r\n\r\nTo the Congress of the United States:\r\n\r\nYou are confronted at the threshold of your legislative duties with a\r\ncondition of the national finances which imperatively demands immediate and\r\ncareful consideration.\r\n\r\nThe amount of money annually exacted, through the operation of present\r\nlaws, from the industries and necessities of the people largely exceeds the\r\nsum necessary to meet the expenses of the Government.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider that the theory of our institutions guarantees to every\r\ncitizen the full enjoyment of all the fruits of his industry and\r\nenterprise, with only such deduction as may be his share toward the careful\r\nand economical maintenance of the Government which protects him, it is\r\nplain that the exaction of more than this is indefensible extortion and a\r\nculpable betrayal of American fairness and justice. This wrong inflicted\r\nupon those who bear the burden of national taxation, like other wrongs,\r\nmultiplies a brood of evil consequences. The public Treasury, which should\r\nonly exist as a conduit conveying the people's tribute to its legitimate\r\nobjects of expenditure, becomes a hoarding place for money needlessly\r\nwithdrawn from trade and the people's use, thus crippling our national\r\nenergies, suspending our country's development, preventing investment in\r\nproductive enterprise, threatening financial disturbance, and inviting\r\nschemes of public plunder.\r\n\r\nThis condition of our Treasury is not altogether new, and it has more than\r\nonce of late been submitted to the people's representatives in the\r\nCongress, who alone can apply a remedy. And yet the situation still\r\ncontinues, with aggravated incidents, more than ever presaging financial\r\nconvulsion and widespread disaster.\r\n\r\nIt will not do to neglect this situation because its dangers are not now\r\npalpably imminent and apparent. They exist none the less certainly, and\r\nawait the unforeseen and unexpected occasion when suddenly they will be\r\nprecipitated upon us.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th day of June, 1885, the excess of revenues over public\r\nexpenditures, after complying with the annual requirement of the\r\nsinking-fund act, was $17,859,735.84; during the year ended June 30, 1886,\r\nsuch excess amounted to $49,405,545.20, and during the year ended June 30,\r\n1887, it reached the sum of $55,567,849.54.\r\n\r\nThe annual contributions to the sinking fund during the three years above\r\nspecified, amounting in the aggregate to $138,058,320.94, and deducted from\r\nthe surplus as stated, were made by calling in for that purpose outstanding\r\n3 per cent bonds of the Government. During the six months prior to June 30,\r\n1887, the surplus revenue had grown so large by repeated accumulations, and\r\nit was feared the withdrawal of this great sum of money needed by the\r\npeople would so affect the business of the country, that the sum of\r\n$79,864,100 of such surplus was applied to the payment of the principal and\r\ninterest of the 3 per cent bonds still outstanding, and which were then\r\npayable at the option of the Government. The precarious condition of\r\nfinancial affairs among the people still needing relief, immediately after\r\nthe 30th day of June, 1887, the remainder of the 3 per cent bonds then\r\noutstanding, amounting with principal and interest to the sum of\r\n$18,877,500, were called in and applied to the sinking-fund contribution\r\nfor the current fiscal year. Notwithstanding these operations of the\r\nTreasury Department, representations of distress in business circles not\r\nonly continued, but increased, and absolute peril seemed at hand. In these\r\ncircumstances the contribution to the sinking fund for the current fiscal\r\nyear was at once completed by the expenditure of $27,684,283.55 in the\r\npurchase of Government bonds not yet due bearing 4 and 41/2 per cent\r\ninterest, the premium paid thereon averaging about 24 per cent for the\r\nformer and 8 per cent for the latter. In addition to this, the interest\r\naccruing during the current year upon the outstanding bonded indebtedness\r\nof the Government was to some extent anticipated, and banks selected as\r\ndepositories of public money were permitted to somewhat increase their\r\ndeposits.\r\n\r\nWhile the expedients thus employed to release to the people the money lying\r\nidle in the Treasury served to avert immediate danger, our surplus revenues\r\nhave continued to accumulate, the excess for the present year amounting on\r\nthe 1st day of December to $55,258,701.19, and estimated to reach the sum\r\nof $113,000,000 on the 30th of June next, at which date it is expected that\r\nthis sum, added to prior accumulations, will swell the surplus in the\r\nTreasury to $140,000,000.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be no assurance that, with such a withdrawal from use of the\r\npeople's circulating medium, our business community may not in the near\r\nfuture be subjected to the same distress which was quite lately produced\r\nfrom the same cause. And while the functions of our National Treasury\r\nshould be few and simple, and while its best condition would be reached, I\r\nbelieve, by its entire disconnection with private business interests, yet\r\nwhen, by a perversion of its purposes, it idly holds money uselessly\r\nsubtracted from the channels of trade, there seems to be reason for the\r\nclaim that some legitimate means should be devised by the Government to\r\nrestore in an emergency, without waste or extravagance, such money to its\r\nplace among the people.\r\n\r\nIf such an emergency arises, there now exists no clear and undoubted\r\nexecutive power of relief. Heretofore the redemption of 3 per cent bonds,\r\nwhich were payable at the option of the Government, has afforded a means\r\nfor the disbursement of the excess of our revenues; but these bonds have\r\nall been retired, and there are no bonds outstanding the payment of which\r\nwe have a right to insist upon. The contribution to the sinking fund which\r\nfurnishes the occasion for expenditure in the purchase of bonds has been\r\nalready made for the current year, so that there is no outlet in that\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nIn the present state of legislation the only pretense of any existing\r\nexecutive power to restore at this time any part of our surplus revenues to\r\nthe people by its expenditure consists in the supposition that the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury may enter the market and purchase the bonds of\r\nthe Government not yet due, at a rate of premium to be agreed upon. The\r\nonly provision of law from which such a power could be derived is found in\r\nan appropriation bill passed a number of years ago, and it is subject to\r\nthe suspicion that it was intended as temporary and limited in its\r\napplication, instead of conferring a continuing discretion and authority.\r\nNo condition ought to exist which would justify the grant of power to a\r\nsingle official, upon his judgment of its necessity, to withhold from or\r\nrelease to the business of the people, in an unusual manner, money held in\r\nthe Treasury, and thus affect at his will the financial situation of the\r\ncountry; and if it is deemed wise to lodge in the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nthe authority in the present juncture to purchase bonds, it should be\r\nplainly vested, and provided, as far as possible, with such checks and\r\nlimitations as will define this official's right and discretion and at the\r\nsame time relieve him from undue responsibility.\r\n\r\nIn considering the question of purchasing bonds as a means of restoring to\r\ncirculation the surplus money accumulating in the Treasury, it should be\r\nborne in mind that premiums must of course be paid upon such purchase, that\r\nthere may be a large part of these bonds held as investments which can not\r\nbe purchased at any price, and that combinations among holders who are\r\nwilling to sell may unreasonably enhance the cost of such bonds to the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that the present bonded debt might be refunded at a\r\nless rate of interest and the difference between the old and new security\r\npaid in cash, thus finding use for the surplus in the Treasury. The success\r\nof this plan, it is apparent, must depend upon the volition of the holders\r\nof the present bonds; and it is not entirely certain that the inducement\r\nwhich must be offered them would result in more financial benefit to the\r\nGovernment than the purchase of bonds, while the latter proposition would\r\nreduce the principal of the debt by actual payment instead of extending\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe proposition to deposit the money held by the Government in banks\r\nthroughout the country for use by the people is, it seems to me,\r\nexceedingly objectionable in principle, as establishing too close a\r\nrelationship between the operations of the Government Treasury and the\r\nbusiness of the country and too extensive a commingling of their money,\r\nthus fostering an unnatural reliance in private business upon public funds.\r\nIf this scheme should be adopted, it should only be done as a temporary\r\nexpedient to meet an urgent necessity. Legislative and executive effort\r\nshould generally be in the opposite direction, and should have a tendency\r\nto divorce, as much and as fast as can be safely done, the Treasury\r\nDepartment from private enterprise.\r\n\r\nOf course it is not expected that unnecessary and extravagant\r\nappropriations will be made for the purpose of avoiding the accumulation of\r\nan excess of revenue. Such expenditure, besides the demoralization of all\r\njust conceptions of public duty which it entails, stimulates a habit of\r\nreckless improvidence not in the least consistent with the mission of our\r\npeople or the high and beneficent purposes of our Government.\r\n\r\nI have deemed it my duty to thus bring to the knowledge of my countrymen,\r\nas well as to the attention of their representatives charged with the\r\nresponsibility of legislative relief, the gravity of our financial\r\nsituation. The failure of the Congress heretofore to provide against the\r\ndangers which it was quite evident the very nature of the difficulty must\r\nnecessarily produce caused a condition of financial distress and\r\napprehension since your last adjournment which taxed to the utmost all the\r\nauthority and expedients within executive control; and these appear now to\r\nbe exhausted. If disaster results from the continued inaction of Congress,\r\nthe responsibility must rest where it belongs.\r\n\r\nThough the situation thus far considered is fraught with danger which\r\nshould be fully realized, and though it presents features of wrong to the\r\npeople as well as peril to the country, it is but a result growing out of a\r\nperfectly palpable and apparent cause, constantly reproducing the same\r\nalarming circumstances--a congested National Treasury and a depleted\r\nmonetary condition in the business of the country. It need hardly be stated\r\nthat while the present situation demands a remedy, we can only be saved\r\nfrom a like predicament in the future by the removal of its cause.\r\n\r\nOur scheme of taxation, by means of which this needless surplus is taken\r\nfrom the people and put into the public Treasury, consists of a tariff or\r\nduty levied upon importations from abroad and internal-revenue taxes levied\r\nupon the consumption of tobacco and spirituous and malt liquors. It must be\r\nconceded that none of the things subjected to internal-revenue taxation\r\nare, strictly speaking, necessaries. There appears to be no just complaint\r\nof this taxation by the consumers of these articles, and there seems to be\r\nnothing so well able to bear the burden without hardship to any portion of\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nBut our present tariff laws, the vicious, inequitable, and illogical source\r\nof unnecessary taxation, ought to be at once revised and amended. These\r\nlaws, as their primary and plain effect, raise the price to consumers of\r\nall articles imported and subject to duty by precisely the sum paid for\r\nsuch duties. Thus the amount of the duty measures the tax paid by those who\r\npurchase for use these imported articles. Many of these things, however,\r\nare raised or manufactured in our own country, and the duties now levied\r\nupon foreign goods and products are called protection to these home\r\nmanufactures, because they render it possible for those of our people who\r\nare manufacturers to make these taxed articles and sell them for a price\r\nequal to that demanded for the imported goods that have paid customs duty.\r\nSo it happens that while comparatively a few use the imported articles,\r\nmillions of our people, who never used and never saw any of the foreign\r\nproducts, purchase and use things of the same kind made in this country,\r\nand pay therefor nearly or quite the same enhanced price which the duty\r\nadds to the imported articles. Those who buy imports pay the duty charged\r\nthereon into the public Treasury, but the great majority of our citizens,\r\nwho buy domestic articles of the same class, pay a sum at least\r\napproximately equal to this duty to the home manufacturer. This reference\r\nto the operation of our tariff laws is not made by way of instruction, but\r\nin order that we may be constantly reminded of the manner in which they\r\nimpose a burden upon those who consume domestic products as well as those\r\nwho consume imported articles, and thus create a tax upon all our people.\r\n\r\nIt is not proposed to entirely relieve the country of this taxation. It\r\nmust be extensively continued as the source of the Government's income; and\r\nin a readjustment of our tariff the interests of American labor engaged in\r\nmanufacture should be carefully considered, as well as the preservation of\r\nour manufacturers. It may be called protection or by any other name, but\r\nrelief from the hardships and dangers of our present tariff laws should be\r\ndevised with especial precaution against imperiling the existence of our\r\nmanufacturing interests. But this existence should not mean a condition\r\nwhich, without regard to the public welfare or a national exigency, must\r\nalways insure the realization of immense profits instead of moderately\r\nprofitable returns. As the volume and diversity of our national activities\r\nincrease, new recruits are added to those who desire a continuation of the\r\nadvantages which they conceive the present system of tariff taxation\r\ndirectly affords them. So stubbornly have all efforts to reform the present\r\ncondition been resisted by those of our fellow-citizens thus engaged that\r\nthey can hardly complain of the suspicion, entertained to a certain extent,\r\nthat there exists an organized combination all along the line to maintain\r\ntheir advantage.\r\n\r\nWe are in the midst of centennial celebrations, and with becoming pride we\r\nrejoice in American skill and ingenuity, in American energy and enterprise,\r\nand in the wonderful natural advantages and resources developed by a\r\ncentury's national growth. Yet when an attempt is made to justify a scheme\r\nwhich permits a tax to be laid upon every consumer in the land for the\r\nbenefit of our manufacturers, quite beyond a reasonable demand for\r\ngovernmental regard, it suits the purposes of advocacy to call our\r\nmanufactures infant industries still needing the highest and greatest\r\ndegree of favor and fostering care that can be wrung from Federal\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nIt is also said that the increase in the price of domestic manufactures\r\nresulting from the present tariff is necessary in order that higher wages\r\nmay be paid to our workingmen employed in manufactories than are paid for\r\nwhat is called the pauper labor of Europe. All will acknowledge the force\r\nof an argument which involves the welfare and liberal compensation of our\r\nlaboring people. Our labor is honorable in the eyes of every American\r\ncitizen; and as it lies at the foundation of our development and progress,\r\nit is entitled, without affectation or hypocrisy, to the utmost regard. The\r\nstandard of our laborers' life should not be measured by that of any other\r\ncountry less favored, and they are entitled to their full share of all our\r\nadvantages.\r\n\r\nBy the last census it is made to appear that of the 17,392,099 of our\r\npopulation engaged in all kinds of industries 7,670,493 are employed in\r\nagriculture, 4,074,238 in professional and personal service (2,934,876 of\r\nwhom are domestic servants and laborers), while 1,810,256 are employed in\r\ntrade and transportation and 3,837,112 are classed as employed in\r\nmanufacturing and mining.\r\n\r\nFor present purposes, however, the last number given should be considerably\r\nreduced. Without attempting to enumerate all, it will be conceded that\r\nthere should be deducted from those which it includes 375,143 carpenters\r\nand joiners, 285,401 milliners, dressmakers, and seamstresses, 172,726\r\nblacksmiths, 133,756 tailors and tailoresses, 102,473 masons, 76,241\r\nbutchers, 41,309 bakers, 22,083 plasterers, and 4,891 engaged in\r\nmanufacturing agricultural implements, amounting in the aggregate to\r\n1,214,023, leaving 2,623,089 persons employed in such manufacturing\r\nindustries as are claimed to be benefited by a high tariff.\r\n\r\nTo these the appeal is made to save their employment and maintain their\r\nwages by resisting a change. There should be no disposition to answer such\r\nsuggestions by the allegation that they are in a minority among those who\r\nlabor, and therefore should forego an advantage in the interest of low\r\nprices for the majority. Their compensation, as it may be affected by the\r\noperation of tariff laws, should at all times be scrupulously kept in view;\r\nand yet with slight reflection they will not overlook the fact that they\r\nare consumers with the rest; that they too have their own wants and those\r\nof their families to supply from their earnings, and that the price of the\r\nnecessaries of life, as well as the amount of their wages, will regulate\r\nthe measure of their welfare and comfort.\r\n\r\nBut the reduction of taxation demanded should be so measured as not to\r\nnecessitate or justify either the loss of employment by the workingman or\r\nthe lessening of his wages; and the profits still remaining to the\r\nmanufacturer after a necessary readjustment should furnish no excuse for\r\nthe sacrifice of the interests of his employees, either in their\r\nopportunity to work or in the diminution of their compensation. Nor can the\r\nworker in manufactures fail to understand that while a high tariff is\r\nclaimed to be necessary to allow the payment of remunerative wages, it\r\ncertainly results in a very large increase in the price of nearly all sorts\r\nof manufactures, which, in almost countless forms, he needs for the use of\r\nhimself and his family. He receives at the desk of his employer his wages,\r\nand perhaps before he reaches his home is obliged, in a purchase for family\r\nuse of an article which embraces his own labor, to return in the payment of\r\nthe increase in price which the tariff permits the hard-earned compensation\r\nof many days of toil.\r\n\r\nThe farmer and the agriculturist, who manufacture nothing, but who pay the\r\nincreased price which the tariff imposes upon every agricultural implement,\r\nupon all he wears, and upon all he uses and owns, except the increase of\r\nhis flocks and herds and such things as his husbandry produces from the\r\nsoil, is invited to aid in maintaining the present situation; and he is\r\ntold that a high duty on imported wool is necessary for the benefit of\r\nthose who have sheep to shear, in order that the price of their wool may be\r\nincreased. They, of course, are not reminded that the farmer who has no\r\nsheep is by this scheme obliged, in his purchases of clothing and woolen\r\ngoods, to pay a tribute to his fellow-farmer as well as to the manufacturer\r\nand merchant, nor is any mention made of the fact that the sheep owners\r\nthemselves and their households must wear clothing and use other articles\r\nmanufactured from the wool they sell at tariff prices, and thus as\r\nconsumers must return their share of this increased price to the\r\ntradesman.\r\n\r\nI think it may be fairly assumed that a large proportion of the sheep owned\r\nby the farmers throughout the country are found in small flocks, numbering\r\nfrom twenty-five to fifty. The duty on the grade of imported wool which\r\nthese sheep yield is 10 cents each pound if of the value of 30 cents or\r\nless and 12 cents if of the value of more than 30 cents. If the liberal\r\nestimate of 6 pounds be allowed for each fleece, the duty thereon would be\r\n60 or 72 cents; and this may be taken as the utmost enhancement of its\r\nprice to the farmer by reason of this duty. Eighteen dollars would thus\r\nrepresent the increased price of the wool from twenty-five sheep and $36\r\nthat from the wool of fifty sheep; and at present values this addition\r\nwould amount to about one-third of its price. If upon its sale the farmer\r\nreceives this or a less tariff profit, the wool leaves his hands charged\r\nwith precisely that sum, which in all its changes will adhere to it until\r\nit reaches the consumer. When manufactured into cloth and other goods and\r\nmaterial for use, its cost is not only increased to the extent of the\r\nfarmer's tariff profit, but a further sum has been added for the benefit of\r\nthe manufacturer under the operation of other tariff laws. In the meantime\r\nthe day arrives when the farmer finds it necessary to purchase woolen goods\r\nand material to clothe himself and family for the winter. When he faces the\r\ntradesman for that purpose, he discovers that he is obliged not only to\r\nreturn in the way of increased prices his tariff profit on the wool he\r\nsold, and which then perhaps lies before him in manufactured form, but that\r\nhe must add a considerable sum thereto to meet a further increase in cost\r\ncaused by a tariff duty on the manufacture. Thus in the end he is aroused\r\nto the fact that he has paid upon a moderate purchase, as a result of the\r\ntariff scheme, which when he sold his wool seemed so profitable, an\r\nincrease in price more than sufficient to sweep away all the tariff profit\r\nhe received upon the wool he produced and sold.\r\n\r\nWhen the number of farmers engaged in wool raising is compared with all the\r\nfarmers in the country and the small proportion they bear to our population\r\nis considered; when it is made apparent that in the case of a large part of\r\nthose who own sheep the benefit of the present tariff on wool is illusory;\r\nand, above all, when it must be conceded that the increase of the cost of\r\nliving caused by such tariff becomes a burden upon those with moderate\r\nmeans and the poor, the employed and unemployed, the sick and well, and the\r\nyoung and old, and that it constitutes a tax which with relentless grasp is\r\nfastened upon the clothing of every man, woman, and child in the land,\r\nreasons are suggested why the removal or reduction of this duty should be\r\nincluded in a revision of our tariff laws.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the increased cost to the consumer of our home manufactures\r\nresulting from a duty laid upon imported articles of the same description,\r\nthe fact is not ever looked that competition among our domestic producers\r\nsometimes has the effect of keeping the price of their products below the\r\nhighest limit allowed by such duty. But it is notorious that this\r\ncompetition is too often strangled by combinations quite prevalent at this\r\ntime, and frequently called trusts, which have for their object the\r\nregulation of the supply and price of commodities made and sold by members\r\nof the combination. The people can hardly hope for any consideration in the\r\noperation of these selfish schemes.\r\n\r\nIf, however, in the absence of such combination, a healthy and free\r\ncompetition reduces the price of any particular dutiable article of home\r\nproduction below the limit which it might otherwise reach under our tariff\r\nlaws, and if with such reduced price its manufacture continues to thrive,\r\nit is entirely evident that one thing has been discovered which should be\r\ncarefully scrutinized in an effort to reduce taxation.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of combination to maintain the price of any commodity to the\r\ntariff point furnishes proof that someone is willing to accept lower prices\r\nfor such commodity and that such prices are remunerative; and lower prices\r\nproduced by competition prove the same thing. Thus where either of these\r\nconditions exists a case would seem to be presented for an easy reduction\r\nof taxation.\r\n\r\nThe considerations which have been presented touching our tariff laws are\r\nintended only to enforce an earnest recommendation that the surplus\r\nrevenues of the Government be prevented by the reduction of our customs\r\nduties, and at the same time to emphasize a suggestion that in\r\naccomplishing this purpose we may discharge a double duty to our people by\r\ngranting to them a measure of relief from tariff taxation in quarters where\r\nit is most needed and from sources where it can be most fairly and justly\r\naccorded.\r\n\r\nNor can the presentation made of such considerations be with any degree of\r\nfairness regarded as evidence of unfriendliness toward our manufacturing\r\ninterests or of any lack of appreciation of their value and importance.\r\n\r\nThese interests constitute a leading and most substantial element of our\r\nnational greatness and furnish the proud proof of our country's progress.\r\nBut if in the emergency that presses upon us our manufacturers are asked to\r\nsurrender something for the public good and to avert disaster, their\r\npatriotism, as well as a grateful recognition of advantages already\r\nafforded, should lead them to willing cooperation. No demand is made that\r\nthey shall forego all the benefits of governmental regard; but they can not\r\nfail to be admonished of their duty, as well as their enlightened\r\nself-interest and safety, when they are reminded of the fact that financial\r\npanic and collapse, to which the present condition tends, afford no greater\r\nshelter or protection to our manufactures than to other important\r\nenterprises. Opportunity for safe, careful, and deliberate reform is now\r\noffered; and none of us should be unmindful of a time when an abused and\r\nirritated people, heedless of those who have resisted timely and reasonable\r\nrelief, may insist upon a radical and sweeping rectification of their\r\nwrongs.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty attending a wise and fair revision of our tariff laws is not\r\nunderestimated. It will require on the part of the Congress great labor and\r\ncare, and especially a broad and national contemplation of the subject and\r\na patriotic disregard of such local and selfish claims as are unreasonable\r\nand reckless of the welfare of the entire country.\r\n\r\nUnder our present laws more than 4,000 articles are subject to duty. Many\r\nof these do not in any way compete with our own manufactures, and many are\r\nhardly worth attention as subjects of revenue. A considerable reduction can\r\nbe made in the aggregate by adding them to the free list. The taxation of\r\nluxuries presents no features of hardship; but the necessaries of life used\r\nand consumed by all the people, the duty upon which adds to the cost of\r\nliving in every home, should be greatly cheapened.\r\n\r\nThe radical reduction of the duties imposed upon raw material used in\r\nmanufactures, or its free importation, is of course an important factor in\r\nany effort to reduce the price of these necessaries. It would not only\r\nrelieve them from the increased cost caused by the tariff on such material,\r\nbut the manufactured product being thus cheapened that part of the tariff\r\nnow laid upon such product, as a compensation to our manufacturers for the\r\npresent price of raw material, could be accordingly modified. Such\r\nreduction or free importation would serve besides to largely reduce the\r\nrevenue. It is not apparent how such a change can have any injurious effect\r\nupon our manufacturers. On the contrary, it would appear to give them a\r\nbetter chance in foreign markets with the manufacturers of other countries,\r\nwho cheapen their wares by free material. Thus our people might have the\r\nopportunity of extending their sales beyond the limits of home consumption,\r\nsaving them from the depression, interruption in business, and loss caused\r\nby a glutted domestic market and affording their employees more certain and\r\nsteady labor, with its resulting quiet and contentment.\r\n\r\nThe question thus imperatively presented for solution should be approached\r\nin a spirit higher than partisanship and considered in the light of that\r\nregard for patriotic duty which should characterize the action of those\r\nintrusted with the weal of a confiding people. But the obligation to\r\ndeclared party policy and principle is not wanting to urge prompt and\r\neffective action. Both of the great political parties now represented in\r\nthe Government have by repeated and authoritative declarations condemned\r\nthe condition of our laws which permit the collection from the people of\r\nunnecessary revenue, and have in the most solemn manner promised its\r\ncorrection; and neither as citizens nor partisans are our countrymen in a\r\nmood to condone the deliberate violation of these pledges.\r\n\r\nOur progress toward a wise conclusion will not be improved by dwelling upon\r\nthe theories of protection and free trade. This savors too much of bandying\r\nepithets. It is a condition which confronts us, not a theory. Relief from\r\nthis condition may involve a slight reduction of the advantages which we\r\naward our home productions, but the entire withdrawal of such advantages\r\nshould not be contemplated. The question of free trade is absolutely\r\nirrelevant, and the persistent claim made in certain quarters that all the\r\nefforts to relieve the people from unjust and unnecessary taxation are\r\nschemes of so-called free traders is mischievous and far removed from any\r\nconsideration for the public good.\r\n\r\nThe simple and plain duty which we owe the people is to reduce taxation to\r\nthe necessary expenses of an economical operation of the Government and to\r\nrestore to the business of the country the money which we hold in the\r\nTreasury through the perversion of governmental powers. These things can\r\nand should be done with safety to all our industries, without danger to the\r\nopportunity for remunerative labor which our workingmen need, and with\r\nbenefit to them and all our people by cheapening their means of subsistence\r\nand increasing the measure of their comforts.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution provides that the President \"shall from time to time give\r\nto the Congress information of the state of the Union.\" It has been the\r\ncustom of the Executive, in compliance with this provision, to annually\r\nexhibit to the Congress, at the opening of its session, the general\r\ncondition of the country, and to detail with some particularity the\r\noperations of the different Executive Departments. It would be especially\r\nagreeable to follow this course at the present time and to call attention\r\nto the valuable accomplishments of these Departments during the last fiscal\r\nyear; but I am so much impressed with the paramount importance of the\r\nsubject to which this communication has thus far been devoted that I shall\r\nforego the addition of any other topic, and only urge upon your immediate\r\nconsideration the \"state of the Union\" as shown in the present condition of\r\nour Treasury and our general fiscal situation, upon which every element of\r\nour safety and prosperity depends.\r\n\r\nThe reports of the heads of Departments, which will be submitted, contain\r\nfull and explicit information touching the transaction of the business\r\nintrusted to them and such recommendations relating to legislation in the\r\npublic interest as they deem advisable. I ask for these reports and\r\nrecommendations the deliberate examination and action of the legislative\r\nbranch of the Government.\r\n\r\nThere are other subjects not embraced in the departmental reports demanding\r\nlegislative consideration, and which I should be glad to submit. Some of\r\nthem, however, have been earnestly presented in previous messages, and as\r\nto them I beg leave to repeat prior recommendations.\r\n\r\nAs the law makes no provision for any report from the Department of State,\r\na brief history of the transactions of that important Department, together\r\nwith other matters which it may hereafter be deemed essential to commend to\r\nthe attention of the Congress, may furnish the occasion for a future\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nGrover Cleveland\r\nDecember 3, 1888\r\n\r\nTo the Congress of the United States:\r\n\r\nAs you assemble for the discharge of the duties you have assumed as the\r\nrepresentatives of a free and generous people, your meeting is marked by an\r\ninteresting and impressive incident. With the expiration of the present\r\nsession of the Congress the first century of our constitutional existence\r\nas a nation will be completed.\r\n\r\nOur survival for one hundred years is not sufficient to assure us that we\r\nno longer have dangers to fear in the maintenance, with all its promised\r\nblessings, of a government rounded upon the freedom of the people. The time\r\nrather admonishes us to soberly inquire whether in the past we have always\r\nclosely kept in the course of safety, and whether we have before us a way\r\nplain and clear which leads to happiness and perpetuity.\r\n\r\nWhen the experiment of our Government was undertaken, the chart adopted for\r\nour guidance was the Constitution. Departure from the lines there laid down\r\nis failure. It is only by a strict adherence to the direction they indicate\r\nand by restraint within the limitations they fix that we can furnish proof\r\nto the world of the fitness of the American people for self-government.\r\n\r\nThe equal and exact justice of which we boast as the underlying principle\r\nof our institutions should not be confined to the relations of our citizens\r\nto each other. The Government itself is under bond to the American people\r\nthat in the exercise of its functions and powers it will deal with the body\r\nof our citizens in a manner scrupulously honest and fair and absolutely\r\njust. It has agreed that American citizenship shall be the only credential\r\nnecessary to justify the claim of equality before the law, and that no\r\ncondition in life shall give rise to discrimination in the treatment of the\r\npeople by their Government.\r\n\r\nThe citizen of our Republic in its early days rigidly insisted upon full\r\ncompliance with the letter of this bond, and saw stretching out before him\r\na clear field for individual endeavor. His tribute to the support of his\r\nGovernment was measured by the cost of its economical maintenance, and he\r\nwas secure in the enjoyment of the remaining recompense of his steady and\r\ncontented toil. In those days the frugality of the people was stamped upon\r\ntheir Government, and was enforced by the free, thoughtful, and intelligent\r\nsuffrage of the citizen. Combinations, monopolies, and aggregations of\r\ncapital were either avoided or sternly regulated and restrained. The pomp\r\nand glitter of governments less free offered no temptation and presented no\r\ndelusion to the plain people who, side by side, in friendly competition,\r\nwrought for the ennoblement and dignity of man, for the solution of the\r\nproblem of free government, and for the achievement of the grand destiny\r\nawaiting the land which God had given them.\r\n\r\nA century has passed. Our cities are the abiding places of wealth and\r\nluxury; our manufactories yield fortunes never dreamed of by the fathers of\r\nthe Republic; our business men are madly striving in the race for riches,\r\nand immense aggregations of capital outrun the imagination in the magnitude\r\nof their undertakings.\r\n\r\nWe view with pride and satisfaction this bright picture of our country's\r\ngrowth and prosperity, while only a closer scrutiny develops a somber\r\nshading. Upon more careful inspection we find the wealth and luxury of our\r\ncities mingled with poverty and wretchedness and unremunerative toil. A\r\ncrowded and constantly increasing urban population suggests the\r\nimpoverishment of rural sections and discontent with agricultural pursuits.\r\nThe farmer's son, not satisfied with his father's simple and laborious\r\nlife, joins the eager chase for easily acquired wealth.\r\n\r\nWe discover that the fortunes realized by our manufacturers are no longer\r\nsolely the reward of sturdy industry and enlightened foresight, but that\r\nthey result from the discriminating favor of the Government and are largely\r\nbuilt upon undue exactions from the masses of our people. The gulf between\r\nemployers and the employed is constantly widening, and classes are rapidly\r\nforming, one comprising the very rich and powerful, while in another are\r\nfound the toiling poor.\r\n\r\nAs we view the achievements of aggregated capital, we discover the\r\nexistence of trusts, combinations, and monopolies, while the citizen is\r\nstruggling far in the rear or is trampled to death beneath an iron heel.\r\nCorporations, which should be the carefully restrained creatures of the law\r\nand the servants of the people, are fast becoming the people's masters.\r\n\r\nStill congratulating ourselves upon the wealth and prosperity of our\r\ncountry and complacently contemplating every incident of change inseparable\r\nfrom these conditions, it is our duty as patriotic citizens to inquire at\r\nthe present stage of our progress how the bond of the Government made with\r\nthe people has been kept and performed.\r\n\r\nInstead of limiting the tribute drawn from our citizens to the necessities\r\nof its economical administration, the Government persists in exacting from\r\nthe substance of the people millions which, unapplied and useless, lie\r\ndormant in its Treasury. This flagrant injustice and this breach of faith\r\nand obligation add to extortion the danger attending the diversion of the\r\ncurrency of the country from the legitimate channels of business.\r\n\r\nUnder the same laws by which these results are produced the Government\r\npermits many millions more to be added to the cost of the living of our\r\npeople and to be taken from our consumers, which unreasonably swell the\r\nprofits of a small but powerful minority.\r\n\r\nThe people must still be taxed for the support of the Government under the\r\noperation of tariff laws. But to the extent that the mass of our citizens\r\nare inordinately burdened beyond any useful public purpose and for the\r\nbenefit of a favored few, the Government, under pretext of an exercise of\r\nits taxing power, enters gratuitously into partnership with these\r\nfavorites, to their advantage and to the injury of a vast majority of our\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThis is not equality before the law.\r\n\r\nThe existing situation is injurious to the health of our entire body\r\npolitic. It stifles in those for whose benefit it is permitted all\r\npatriotic love of country, and substitutes in its place selfish greed and\r\ngrasping avarice. Devotion to American citizenship for its own sake and for\r\nwhat it should accomplish as a motive to our nation's advancement and the\r\nhappiness of all our people is displaced by the assumption that the\r\nGovernment, instead of being the embodiment of equality, is but an\r\ninstrumentality through which especial and individual advantages are to be\r\ngained.\r\n\r\nThe arrogance of this assumption is unconcealed. It appears in the sordid\r\ndisregard of all but personal interests, in the refusal to abate for the\r\nbenefit of others one iota of selfish advantage, and in combinations to\r\nperpetuate such advantages through efforts to control legislation and\r\nimproperly influence the suffrages of the people.\r\n\r\nThe grievances of those not included within the circle of these\r\nbeneficiaries, when fully realized, will surely arouse irritation and\r\ndiscontent. Our farmers, long suffering and patient, struggling in the race\r\nof life with the hardest and most unremitting toil, will not fail to see,\r\nin spite of misrepresentations and misleading fallacies, that they are\r\nobliged to accept such prices for their products as are fixed in foreign\r\nmarkets where they compete with the farmers of the world; that their lands\r\nare declining in value while their debts increase, and that without\r\ncompensating favor they are forced by the action of the Government to pay\r\nfor the benefit of others such enhanced prices for the things they need\r\nthat the scanty returns of their labor fail to furnish their support or\r\nleave no margin for accumulation.\r\n\r\nOur workingmen, enfranchised from all delusions and no longer frightened by\r\nthe cry that their wages are endangered by a just revision of our tariff\r\nlaws, will reasonably demand through such revision steadier employment,\r\ncheaper means of living in their homes, freedom for themselves and their\r\nchildren from the doom of perpetual servitude, and an open door to their\r\nadvancement beyond the limits of a laboring class. Others of our citizens,\r\nwhose comforts and expenditures are measured by moderate salaries and fixed\r\nincomes, will insist upon the fairness and justice of cheapening the cost\r\nof necessaries for themselves and their families.\r\n\r\nWhen to the selfishness of the beneficiaries of unjust discrimination under\r\nour laws there shall be added the discontent of those who suffer from such\r\ndiscrimination, we will realize the fact that the beneficent purposes of\r\nour Government, dependent upon the patriotism and contentment of our\r\npeople, are endangered.\r\n\r\nCommunism is a hateful thing and a menace to peace and organized\r\ngovernment; but the communism of combined wealth and capital, the outgrowth\r\nof overweening cupidity and selfishness, which insidiously undermines the\r\njustice and integrity of free institutions, is not less dangerous than the\r\ncommunism of oppressed poverty and toil, which, exasperated by injustice\r\nand discontent, attacks with wild disorder the citadel of rule.\r\n\r\nHe mocks the people who proposes that the Government shall protect the rich\r\nand that they in turn will care for the laboring poor. Any intermediary\r\nbetween the people and their Government or the least delegation of the care\r\nand protection the Government owes to the humblest citizen in the land\r\nmakes the boast of free institutions a glittering delusion and the\r\npretended boon of American citizenship a shameless imposition.\r\n\r\nA just and sensible revision of our tariff laws should be made for the\r\nrelief of those of our countrymen who suffer under present conditions. Such\r\na revision should receive the support of all who love that justice and\r\nequality due to American citizenship; of all who realize that in this\r\njustice and equality our Government finds its strength and its power to\r\nprotect the citizen and his property; of all who believe that the contented\r\ncompetence and comfort of many accord better with the spirit of our\r\ninstitutions than colossal fortunes unfairly gathered in the hands of a\r\nfew; of all who appreciate that the forbearance and fraternity among our\r\npeople, which recognize the value of every American interest, are the\r\nsurest guaranty of our national progress, and of all who desire to see the\r\nproducts of American skill and ingenuity in every market of the world, with\r\na resulting restoration of American commerce.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of the reduction of our revenues is so apparent as to be\r\ngenerally conceded, but the means by which this end shall be accomplished\r\nand the sum of direct benefit which shall result to our citizens present a\r\ncontroversy of the utmost importance. There should be no scheme accepted as\r\nsatisfactory by which the burdens of the people are only apparently\r\nremoved. Extravagant appropriations of public money, with all their\r\ndemoralizing consequences, should not be tolerated, either as a means of\r\nrelieving the Treasury of its present surplus or as furnishing pretext for\r\nresisting a proper reduction in tariff rates. Existing evils and injustice\r\nshould be honestly recognized, boldly met, and effectively remedied. There\r\nshould be no cessation of the struggle until a plan is perfected, fair and\r\nconservative toward existing industries, but which will reduce the cost to\r\nconsumers of the necessaries of life, while it provides for our\r\nmanufacturers the advantage of freer raw materials and permits no injury to\r\nthe interests of American labor.\r\n\r\nThe cause for which the battle is waged is comprised within lines clearly\r\nand distinctly defined. It should never be compromised. It is the people's\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nIt can not be denied that the selfish and private interests which are so\r\npersistently heard when efforts are made to deal in a just and\r\ncomprehensive manner with our tariff laws are related to, if they are not\r\nresponsible for, the sentiment largely prevailing among the people that the\r\nGeneral Government is the fountain of individual and private aid; that it\r\nmay be expected to relieve with paternal care the distress of citizens and\r\ncommunities, and that from the fullness of its Treasury it should, upon the\r\nslightest possible pretext of promoting the general good, apply public\r\nfunds to the benefit of localities and individuals. Nor can it be denied\r\nthat there is a growing assumption that, as against the Government and in\r\nfavor of private claims and interests, the usual rules and limitations of\r\nbusiness principles and just dealing should be waived.\r\n\r\nThese ideas have been unhappily much encouraged by legislative\r\nacquiescence. Relief from contracts made with the Government is too easily\r\naccorded in favor of the citizen; the failure to support claims against the\r\nGovernment by proof is often supplied by no better consideration than the\r\nwealth of the Government and the poverty of the claimant; gratuities in the\r\nform of pensions are granted upon no other real ground than the needy\r\ncondition of the applicant, or for reasons less valid; and large sums are\r\nexpended for public buildings and other improvements upon representations\r\nscarcely claimed to be related to public needs and necessities.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which the consideration of such matters subordinate and\r\npostpone action upon subjects of great public importance, but involving no\r\nspecial private or partisan interest, should arrest attention and lead to\r\nreformation.\r\n\r\nA few of the numerous illustrations of this condition may be stated.\r\n\r\nThe crowded condition of the calendar of the Supreme Court, and the delay\r\nto suitors and denial of justice resulting therefrom, has been strongly\r\nurged upon the attention of the Congress, with a plan for the relief of the\r\nsituation approved by those well able to judge of its merits. While this\r\nsubject remains without effective consideration, many laws have been passed\r\nproviding for the holding of terms of inferior courts at places to suit the\r\nconvenience of localities, or to lay the foundation of an application for\r\nthe erection of a new public building.\r\n\r\nRepeated recommendations have been submitted for the amendment and change\r\nof the laws relating to our public lands so that their spoliation and\r\ndiversion to other uses than as homes for honest settlers might be\r\nprevented. While a measure to meet this conceded necessity of reform\r\nremains awaiting the action of the Congress, many claims to the public\r\nlands and applications for their donation, in favor of States and\r\nindividuals, have been allowed.\r\n\r\nA plan in aid of Indian management, recommended by those well informed as\r\ncontaining valuable features in furtherance of the solution of the Indian\r\nproblem, has thus far failed of legislative sanction, while grants of\r\ndoubtful expediency to railroad corporations, permitting them to pass\r\nthrough Indian reservations, have greatly multiplied.\r\n\r\nThe propriety and necessity of the erection of one or more prisons for the\r\nconfinement of United States convicts, and a post-office building in the\r\nnational capital, are not disputed. But these needs yet remain answered,\r\nwhile scores of public buildings have been erected where their necessity\r\nfor public purposes is not apparent.\r\n\r\nA revision of our pension laws could easily be made which would rest upon\r\njust principles and provide for every worthy applicant. But while our\r\ngeneral pension laws remain confused and imperfect, hundreds of private\r\npension laws are annually passed, which are the sources of unjust\r\ndiscrimination and popular demoralization.\r\n\r\nAppropriation bills for the support of the Government are defaced by items\r\nand provisions to meet private ends, and it is freely asserted by\r\nresponsible and experienced parties that a bill appropriating money for\r\npublic internal improvement would fail to meet with favor unless it\r\ncontained items more for local and private advantage than for public\r\nbenefit.\r\n\r\nThese statements can be much emphasized by an ascertainment of the\r\nproportion of Federal legislation which either bears upon its face its\r\nprivate character or which upon examination develops such a motive power.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the people wait and expect from their chosen representatives such\r\npatriotic action as will advance the welfare of the entire country; and\r\nthis expectation can only be answered by the performance of public duty\r\nwith unselfish purpose. Our mission among the nations of the earth and our\r\nsuccess in accomplishing the work God has given the American people to do\r\nrequire of those intrusted with the making and execution of our laws\r\nperfect devotion, above all other things, to the public good.\r\n\r\nThis devotion will lead us to strongly resist all impatience of\r\nconstitutional limitations of Federal power and to persistently check the\r\nincreasing tendency to extend the scope of Federal legislation into the\r\ndomain of State and local jurisdiction upon the plea of subserving the\r\npublic welfare. The preservation of the partitions between proper subjects\r\nof Federal and local care and regulation is of such importance under the\r\nConstitution, which is the law of our very existence, that no consideration\r\nof expediency or sentiment should tempt us to enter upon doubtful ground.\r\nWe have undertaken to discover and proclaim the richest blessings of a free\r\ngovernment, with the Constitution as our guide. Let us follow the way it\r\npoints out; it will not mislead us. And surely no one who has taken upon\r\nhimself the solemn obligation to support and preserve the Constitution can\r\nfind justification or solace for disloyalty in the excuse that he wandered\r\nand disobeyed in search of a better way to reach the public welfare than\r\nthe Constitution offers.\r\n\r\nWhat has been said is deemed not inappropriate at a time when, from a\r\ncentury's height, we view the way already trod by the American people and\r\nattempt to discover their future path.\r\n\r\nThe seventh President of the United States--the soldier and statesman and\r\nat all times the firm and brave friend of the people--in vindication of his\r\ncourse as the protector of popular rights and the champion of true American\r\ncitizenship, declared: The ambition which leads me on is an anxious desire\r\nand a fixed determination to restore to the people unimpaired the sacred\r\ntrust they have confided to my charge; to, heal the wounds of the\r\nConstitution and to preserve it from further violation; to persuade my\r\ncountrymen, so far as I may, that it is not in a splendid government\r\nsupported by powerful monopolies and aristocratical establishments that\r\nthey will find happiness or their liberties protection, but in a plain\r\nsystem, void of pomp, protecting all and granting favors to none,\r\ndispensing its blessings like the dews of heaven, unseen and unfelt save in\r\nthe freshness and beauty they contribute to produce. It is such a\r\ngovernment that the genius of our people requires--such an one only under\r\nwhich our States may remain for ages to come united, prosperous, and free.\r\nIn pursuance of a constitutional provision requiring the President from\r\ntime to time to give to the Congress information of the state of the Union,\r\nI have the satisfaction to announce that the close of the year finds the\r\nUnited States in the enjoyment of domestic tranquillity and at peace with\r\nall the nations.\r\n\r\nSince my last annual message our foreign relations have been strengthened\r\nand improved by performance of international good offices and by new and\r\nrenewed treaties of amity, commerce, and reciprocal extradition of\r\ncriminals.\r\n\r\nThose international questions which still await settlement are all\r\nreasonably within the domain of amicable negotiation, and there is no\r\nexisting subject of dispute between the United States and any foreign power\r\nthat is not susceptible of satisfactory adjustment by frank diplomatic\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nThe questions between Great Britain and the United States relating to the\r\nrights of American fishermen, under treaty and international comity, in the\r\nterritorial waters of Canada and Newfoundland, I regret to say, are not yet\r\nsatisfactorily adjusted.\r\n\r\nThese matters were fully treated in my message to the Senate of February 20\r\n1888, together with which a convention, concluded under my authority with\r\nHer Majesty's Government on the 15th of February last, for the removal of\r\nall causes of misunderstanding, was submitted by me for the approval of the\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\nThis treaty having been rejected by the Senate, I transmitted a message to\r\nthe Congress on the 23d of August last reviewing the transactions and\r\nsubmitting for consideration certain recommendations for legislation\r\nconcerning the important questions involved.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, on the 12th of September, in response to a resolution of the\r\nSenate, I again communicated fully all the information in my possession as\r\nto the action of the government of Canada affecting the commercial\r\nrelations between the Dominion and the United States, including the\r\ntreatment of American fishing vessels in the ports and waters of British\r\nNorth America.\r\n\r\nThese communications have all been published, and therefore opened to the\r\nknowledge of both Houses of Congress, although two were addressed to the\r\nSenate alone.\r\n\r\nComment upon or repetition of their contents would be superfluous, and I am\r\nnot aware that anything has since occurred which should be added to the\r\nfacts therein stated. Therefore I merely repeat, as applicable to the\r\npresent time, the statement which will be found in my message to the Senate\r\nof September 12 last, that--Since March 3, 1887, no case has been reported\r\nto the Department of State wherein complaint was made of unfriendly or\r\nunlawful treatment of American fishing vessels on the part of the Canadian\r\nauthorities in which reparation was not promptly and satisfactorily\r\nobtained by the United States consul-general at Halifax. Having essayed in\r\nthe discharge of my duty to procure by negotiation the settlement of a\r\nlong-standing cause of dispute and to remove a constant menace to the good\r\nrelations of the two countries, and continuing to be of opinion that the\r\ntreaty of February last, which failed to receive the approval of the\r\nSenate, did supply \"a satisfactory, practical, and final adjustment, upon a\r\nbasis honorable and just to both parties, of the difficult and vexed\r\nquestion to which it related,\" and having subsequently and unavailingly\r\nrecommended other legislation to Congress which I hoped would suffice to\r\nmeet the exigency created by the rejection of the treaty, I now again\r\ninvoke the earnest and immediate attention of the Congress to the condition\r\nof this important question as it now stands before them and the country,\r\nand for the settlement of which I am deeply solicitous.\r\n\r\nNear the close of the month of October last occurrences of a deeply\r\nregrettable nature were brought to my knowledge, which made it my painful\r\nbut imperative duty to obtain with as little delay as possible a new\r\npersonal channel of diplomatic intercourse in this country with the\r\nGovernment of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence in relation to this incident will in due course be laid\r\nbefore you, and will disclose the unpardonable conduct of the official\r\nreferred to in his interference by advice and counsel with the suffrages of\r\nAmerican citizens in the very crisis of the Presidential election then near\r\nat hand, and also in his subsequent public declarations to justify his\r\naction, superadding impugnment of the Executive and Senate of the United\r\nStates in connection with important questions now pending in controversy\r\nbetween the two Governments.\r\n\r\nThe offense thus committed was most grave, involving disastrous\r\npossibilities to the good relations of the United States and Great Britain,\r\nconstituting a gross breach of diplomatic privilege and an invasion of the\r\npurely domestic affairs and essential sovereignty of the Government to\r\nwhich the envoy was accredited.\r\n\r\nHaving first fulfilled the just demands of international comity by\r\naffording full opportunity for Her Majesty's Government to act in relief of\r\nthe situation, I considered prolongation of discussion to be unwarranted,\r\nand thereupon declined to further recognize the diplomatic character of the\r\nperson whose continuance in such function would destroy that mutual\r\nconfidence which is essential to the good understanding of the two\r\nGovernments and was inconsistent with the welfare and self-respect of the\r\nGovernment of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe usual interchange of communication has since continued through Her\r\nMajesty's legation in this city.\r\n\r\nMy endeavors to establish by international cooperation measures for the\r\nprevention of the extermination of fur seals in Bering Sea have not been\r\nrelaxed, and I have hopes of being enabled shortly to submit an effective\r\nand satisfactory conventional projet with the maritime powers for the\r\napproval of the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe coastal boundary between our Alaskan possessions and British Columbia,\r\nI regret to say, has not received the attention demanded by its importance,\r\nand which on several occasions heretofore I have had the honor to recommend\r\nto the Congress.\r\n\r\nThe admitted impracticability, if not impossibility, of making an accurate\r\nand precise survey and demarcation of the boundary line as it is recited in\r\nthe treaty with Russia under which Alaska was ceded to the United States\r\nrenders it absolutely requisite for the prevention of international\r\njurisdictional complications that adequate appropriation for a\r\nreconnoissance and survey to obtain proper knowledge of the locality and\r\nthe geographical features of the boundary should be authorized by Congress\r\nwith as little delay as possible.\r\n\r\nKnowledge to be only thus obtained is an essential prerequisite for\r\nnegotiation for ascertaining a common boundary, or as preliminary to any\r\nother mode of settlement.\r\n\r\nIt is much to be desired that some agreement should be reached with Her\r\nMajesty's Government by which the damages to life and property on the Great\r\nLakes may be alleviated by removing or humanely regulating the obstacles to\r\nreciprocal assistance to wrecked or stranded vessels.\r\n\r\nThe act of June 19, 1878, which offers to Canadian vessels free access to\r\nour inland waters in aid of wrecked or disabled vessels, has not yet become\r\neffective through concurrent action by Canada.\r\n\r\nThe due protection of our citizens of French origin or descent from claim\r\nof military service in the event of their returning to or visiting France\r\nhas called forth correspondence which was laid before you at the last\r\nsession.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of conventional agreement as to naturalization, which is\r\ngreatly to be desired, this Government sees no occasion to recede from the\r\nsound position it has maintained not only with regard to France, but as to\r\nall countries with which the United States have not concluded special\r\ntreaties.\r\n\r\nTwice within the last year has the imperial household of Germany been\r\nvisited by death; and I have hastened to express the sorrow of this people,\r\nand their appreciation of the lofty character of the late aged Emperor\r\nWilliam, and their sympathy with the heroism under suffering of his son the\r\nlate Emperor Frederick.\r\n\r\nI renew my recommendation of two years ago for the passage of a bill for\r\nthe refunding to certain German steamship lines of the interest upon\r\ntonnage dues illegally exacted.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th [2d] of April last I laid before the House of Representatives\r\nfull information respecting our interests in Samoa; and in the subsequent\r\ncorrespondence on the same subject, which will be laid before you in due\r\ncourse, the history of events in those islands will be found.\r\n\r\nIn a message accompanying my approval, on the 1st day of October last, of a\r\nbill for the exclusion of Chinese laborers, I laid before Congress full\r\ninformation and all correspondence touching the negotiation of the treaty\r\nwith China concluded at this capital on the 12th day of March, 1888, and\r\nwhich, having been confirmed by the Senate with certain amendments, was\r\nrejected by the Chinese Government. This message contained a recommendation\r\nthat a sum of money be appropriated as compensation to Chinese subjects who\r\nhad suffered injuries at the hands of lawless men within our jurisdiction.\r\nSuch appropriation having been duly made, the fund awaits reception by the\r\nChinese Government.\r\n\r\nIt is sincerely hoped that by the cessation of the influx of this class of\r\nChinese subjects, in accordance with the expressed wish of both\r\nGovernments, a cause of unkind feeling has been permanently removed.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of August, 1887, notification was given by the Japanese minister\r\nat this capital of the adjournment of the conference for the revision of\r\nthe treaties of Japan with foreign powers, owing to the objection of his\r\nGovernment to the provision in the draft jurisdictional convention which\r\nrequired the submission of the criminal code of the Empire to the powers in\r\nadvance of its becoming operative. This notification was, however,\r\naccompanied with an assurance of Japan's intention to continue the work of\r\nrevision.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this temporary interruption of negotiations, it is hoped\r\nthat improvements may soon be secured in the jurisdictional system as\r\nrespects foreigners in Japan, and relief afforded to that country from the\r\npresent undue and oppressive foreign control in matters of commerce.\r\n\r\nI earnestly recommend that relief be provided for the injuries accidentally\r\ncaused to Japanese subjects in the island Ikisima by the target practice of\r\none of our vessels.\r\n\r\nA diplomatic mission from Korea has been received, and the formal\r\nintercourse between the two countries contemplated by the treaty of 1882 is\r\nnow established.\r\n\r\nLegislative provision is hereby recommended to organize and equip consular\r\ncourts in Korea.\r\n\r\nPersia has established diplomatic representation at this capital, and has\r\nevinced very great interest in the enterprise and achievements of our\r\ncitizens. I am therefore hopeful that beneficial commercial relations\r\nbetween the two countries may be brought about.\r\n\r\nI announce with sincere regret that Hayti has again become the theater of\r\ninsurrection, disorder, and bloodshed. The titular government of president\r\nSaloman has been forcibly overthrown and he driven out of the country to\r\nFrance, where he has since died.\r\n\r\nThe tenure of power has been so unstable amid the war of factions that has\r\nensued since the expulsion of President Saloman that no government\r\nconstituted by the will of the Haytian people has been recognized as\r\nadministering responsibly the affairs of that country. Our representative\r\nhas been instructed to abstain from interference between the warring\r\nfactions, and a vessel of our Navy has been sent to Haytian waters to\r\nsustain our minister and for the protection of the persons and property of\r\nAmerican citizens.\r\n\r\nDue precautions have been taken to enforce our neutrality laws and prevent\r\nour territory from becoming the base of military supplies for either of the\r\nwarring factions.\r\n\r\nUnder color of a blockade, of which no reasonable notice had been given,\r\nand which does not appear to have been efficiently maintained, a seizure of\r\nvessels under the American flag has been reported, and in consequence\r\nmeasures to prevent and redress any molestation of our innocent merchantmen\r\nhave been adopted.\r\n\r\nProclamation was duly made on the 9th day of November, 1887, of the\r\nconventional extensions of the treaty of June 3, 1875, with Hawaii, under\r\nwhich relations of such special and beneficent intercourse have been\r\ncreated.\r\n\r\nIn the vast field of Oriental commerce now unfolded from our Pacific\r\nborders no feature presents stronger recommendations for Congressional\r\naction than the establishment of communication by submarine telegraph with\r\nHonolulu.\r\n\r\nThe geographical position of the Hawaiian group in relation to our Pacific\r\nStates creates a natural interdependency and mutuality of interest which\r\nour present treaties were intended to foster, and which make close\r\ncommunication a logical and commercial necessity.\r\n\r\nThe wisdom of concluding a treaty of commercial reciprocity with Mexico has\r\nbeen heretofore stated in my messages to Congress, and the lapse of time\r\nand growth of commerce with that close neighbor and sister Republic confirm\r\nthe judgment so expressed.\r\n\r\nThe precise relocation of our boundary line is needful, and adequate\r\nappropriation is now recommended.\r\n\r\nIt is with sincere satisfaction that I am enabled to advert to the spirit\r\nof good neighborhood and friendly cooperation and conciliation that has\r\nmarked the correspondence and action of the Mexican authorities in their\r\nshare of the task of maintaining law and order about the line of our common\r\nboundary.\r\n\r\nThe long-pending boundary dispute between Costa Rica and Nicaragua was\r\nreferred to my arbitration, and by an award made on the 22d of March last\r\nthe question has been finally settled to the expressed satisfaction of both\r\nof the parties in interest.\r\n\r\nThe Empire of Brazil, in abolishing the last vestige of slavery among\r\nChristian nations, called forth the earnest congratulations of this\r\nGovernment in expression of the cordial sympathies of our people.\r\n\r\nThe claims of nearly all other countries against Chile growing out of her\r\nlate war with Bolivia and Peru have been disposed of, either by arbitration\r\nor by a lump settlement. Similar claims of our citizens will continue to be\r\nurged upon the Chilean Government, and it is hoped will not be subject to\r\nfurther delays.\r\n\r\nA comprehensive treaty of amity and commerce with Peru was proclaimed on\r\nNovember 7 last, and it is expected that under its operation mutual\r\nprosperity and good understanding will be promoted.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the policy of arbitration, a treaty to settle the claim of\r\nSantos, an American citizen, against Ecuador has been concluded under my\r\nauthority, and will be duly submitted for the approval of the Senate.\r\n\r\nLike disposition of the claim of Carlos Butterfield against Denmark and of\r\nVan Bokkelen against Hayti will probably be made, and I trust the principle\r\nof such settlements may be extended in practice under the approval of the\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\nThrough unforeseen causes, foreign to the will of both Governments, the\r\nratification of the convention of December 5, 1885, with Venezuela, for the\r\nrehearing of claims of citizens of the United States under the treaty of\r\n1866, failed of exchange within the term provided, and a supplementary\r\nconvention, further extending the time for exchange of ratifications and\r\nexplanatory of an ambiguous provision of the prior convention, now awaits\r\nthe advice and consent of the Senate.\r\n\r\nAlthough this matter, in the stage referred to, concerns only the\r\nconcurrent treaty-making power of one branch of Congress, I advert to it in\r\nview of the interest repeatedly and conspicuously shown by you in your\r\nlegislative capacity in favor of a speedy and equitable adjustment of the\r\nquestions growing out of the discredited judgments of the previous mixed\r\ncommission of Caracas. With every desire to do justice to the\r\nrepresentations of Venezuela in this regard, the time seems to have come to\r\nend this matter, and I trust the prompt confirmation by both parties of the\r\nsupplementary action referred to will avert the need of legislative or\r\nother action to prevent the longer withholding of such rights of actual\r\nclaimants as may be shown to exist.\r\n\r\nAs authorized by the Congress, preliminary steps have been taken for the\r\nassemblage at this capital during the coming year of the representatives of\r\nSouth and Central American States, together with those of Mexico, Hayti,\r\nand San Domingo, to discuss sundry important monetary and commercial\r\ntopics.\r\n\r\nExcepting in those cases where, from reasons of contiguity of territory and\r\nthe existence of a common border line incapable of being guarded,\r\nreciprocal commercial treaties may be found expedient, it is believed that\r\ncommercial policies inducing freer mutual exchange of products can be most\r\nadvantageously arranged by independent but cooperative legislation.\r\n\r\nIn the mode last mentioned the control of our taxation for revenue will be\r\nalways retained in our own hands unrestricted by conventional agreements\r\nwith other governments.\r\n\r\nIn conformity also with Congressional authority, the maritime powers have\r\nbeen invited to confer in Washington in April next upon the practicability\r\nof devising uniform rules and measures for the greater security of life and\r\nproperty at sea. A disposition to accept on the part of a number of the\r\npowers has already been manifested, and if the cooperation of the nations\r\nchiefly interested shall be secured important results may be confidently\r\nanticipated.\r\n\r\nThe act of June 26, 1884, and the acts amendatory thereof, in relation to\r\ntonnage duties, have given rise to extended correspondence with foreign\r\nnations with whom we have existing treaties of navigation and commerce, and\r\nhave caused wide and regrettable divergence of opinion in relation to the\r\nimposition of the duties referred to. These questions are important, and I\r\nshall make them the subject of a special and more detailed communication at\r\nthe present session.\r\n\r\nWith the rapid increase of immigration to our shores and the facilities of\r\nmodern travel, abuses of the generous privileges afforded by our\r\nnaturalization laws call for their careful revision.\r\n\r\nThe easy and unguarded manner in which certificates of American citizenship\r\ncan now be obtained has induced a class, unfortunately large, to avail\r\nthemselves of the opportunity to become absolved from allegiance to their\r\nnative land, and yet by a foreign residence to escape any just duty and\r\ncontribution of service to the country of their proposed adoption. Thus,\r\nwhile evading the duties of citizenship to the United States, they may make\r\nprompt claim for its national protection and demand its intervention in\r\ntheir behalf. International complications of a serious nature arise, and\r\nthe correspondence of the State Department discloses the great number and\r\ncomplexity of the questions which have been raised.\r\n\r\nOur laws regulating the issue of passports should be carefully revised, and\r\nthe institution of a central bureau of registration at the capital is again\r\nstrongly recommended. By this means full particulars of each case of\r\nnaturalization in the United States would be secured and properly indexed\r\nand recorded, and thus many cases of spurious citizenship would be detected\r\nand unjust responsibilities would be avoided.\r\n\r\nThe reorganization of the consular service is a matter of serious\r\nimportance to our national interests. The number of existing principal\r\nconsular offices is believed to be greater than is at all necessary for the\r\nconduct of the public business. It need not be our policy to maintain more\r\nthan a moderate number of principal offices, each supported by a salary\r\nsufficient to enable the incumbent to live in comfort, and so distributed\r\nas to secure the convenient supervision, through subordinate agencies, of\r\naffairs over a considerable district.\r\n\r\nI repeat the recommendations heretofore made by me that the appropriations\r\nfor the maintenance of our diplomatic and consular service should be\r\nrecast; that the so-called notarial or unofficial fees, which our\r\nrepresentatives abroad are now permitted to treat as personal perquisites,\r\nshould be forbidden; that a system of consular inspection should be\r\ninstituted, and that a limited number of secretaries of legation at large\r\nshould be authorized.\r\n\r\nPreparations for the centennial celebration, on April 30, 1889, of the\r\ninauguration of George Washington as President of the United States, at the\r\ncity of New York, have been made by a voluntary organization of the\r\ncitizens of that locality, and believing that an opportunity should be\r\nafforded for the expression of the interest felt throughout the country in\r\nthis event, I respectfully recommend fitting and cooperative action by\r\nCongress on behalf of the people of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Treasury exhibits in detail the\r\ncondition of our national finances and the operations of the several\r\nbranches of the Government related to his Department.\r\n\r\nThe total ordinary revenues of the Government for the fiscal year ended\r\nJune 30, 1888, amounted to $379,266,074.76, of which $219,091,173.63 was\r\nreceived from customs duties and $124,296,871.98 from internal revenue\r\ntaxes.\r\n\r\nThe total receipts from all sources exceeded those for the fiscal year\r\nended June 30, 1887, by $7,862,797.10.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary expenditures of the Government for the fiscal year ending June\r\n30, 1888, were $259,653,958.67, leaving a surplus of $119,612,116.09.\r\n\r\nThe decrease in these expenditures as compared with the fiscal year ended\r\nJune 30, 1887, was $8,278,221.30, notwithstanding the payment of more than\r\n$5,000,000 for pensions in excess of what was paid for that purpose in the\r\nlatter-mentioned year.\r\n\r\nThe revenues of the Government for the year ending June 30, 1889,\r\nascertained for the quarter ended September 30, 1888, and estimated for the\r\nremainder of the time, amount to $377,000,000, and the actual and estimated\r\nordinary expenditures for the same year are $273,000,000, leaving an\r\nestimated surplus of $104,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe estimated receipts for the year ending June 30, 1890, are $377,000,000,\r\nand the estimated ordinary expenditures for the same time are\r\n$275,767,488.34, showing a surplus of $101,232,511.66.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing statements of surplus do not take into account the sum\r\nnecessary to be expended to meet the requirements of the sinking-fund act,\r\namounting to more than $47,000,000 annually.\r\n\r\nThe cost of collecting the customs revenues for the last fiscal year was\r\n2.44 per cent; for the year 1885 it was 3.77 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe excess of internal-revenue taxes collected during the last fiscal year\r\nover those collected for the year ended June 30, 1887, was $5,489,174.26,\r\nand the cost of collecting this revenue decreased from 3.4 per cent in 1887\r\nto less than 3.2 per cent for the last year. The tax collected on\r\noleomargarine was $723,948.04 for the year ending June 30, 1887, and\r\n$864,139.88 for the following year.\r\n\r\nThe requirements of the sinking-fund act have been met for the year ended\r\nJune 30, 1888, and for the current year also, by the purchase of bonds.\r\nAfter complying with this law as positively required, and bonds sufficient\r\nfor that purpose had been bought at a premium, it was not deemed prudent to\r\nfurther expend the surplus in such purchases until the authority to do so\r\nshould be more explicit. A resolution, however, having been passed by both\r\nHouses of Congress removing all doubt as to Executive authority, daily\r\npurchases of bonds were commenced on the 23d day of April, 1888, and have\r\ncontinued until the present time. By this plan bonds of the Government not\r\nyet due have been purchased up to and including the 30th day of November,\r\n1888, amounting to $94,700,400, the premium paid thereon amounting to\r\n$17,508,613.08.\r\n\r\nThe premium added to the principal of these bonds represents an investment\r\nyielding about 2 per cent interest for the time they still had to run, and\r\nthe saving to the Government represented by the difference between the\r\namount of interest at 2 per cent upon the sum paid for principal and\r\npremium and what it would have paid for interest at the rate specified in\r\nthe bonds if they had run to their maturity is about $27,165,000.\r\n\r\nAt first sight this would seem to be a profitable and sensible transaction\r\non the part of the Government, but, as suggested by the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, the surplus thus expended for the purchase of bonds was money\r\ndrawn from the people in excess of any actual need of the Government and\r\nwas so expended rather than allow it to remain idle in the Treasury. If\r\nthis surplus, under the operation of just and equitable laws, had been left\r\nin the hands of the people, it would have been worth in their business at\r\nleast 6 per cent per annum. Deducting from the amount of interest upon the\r\nprincipal and premium of these bonds for the time they had to run at the\r\nrate of 6 per cent the saving of 2 per cent made for the people by the\r\npurchase of such bonds, the loss will appear to be $55,760,000.\r\n\r\nThis calculation would seem to demonstrate that if excessive and\r\nunnecessary taxation is continued and the Government is forced to pursue\r\nthis policy of purchasing its own bonds at the premiums which it will be\r\nnecessary to pay, the loss to the people will be hundreds of millions of\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nSince the purchase of bonds was undertaken as mentioned nearly all that\r\nhave been offered were at last accepted. It has been made quite apparent\r\nthat the Government was in danger of being subjected to combinations to\r\nraise their price, as appears by the instance cited by the Secretary of the\r\noffering of bonds of the par value of only $326,000 so often that the\r\naggregate of the sums demanded for their purchase amounted to more than $\r\n19,700,000.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the large sums paid out in the purchase of bonds, the\r\nsurplus in the Treasury on the 30th day of November, 1888, was\r\n$52,234,610.01, after deducting about $20,000,000 just drawn out for the\r\npayment of pensions.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the fiscal year ended June 30, 1887, there had been coined\r\nunder the compulsory silver-coinage act $266,988,280 in silver dollars,\r\n$55,504,310 of which were in the hands of the people.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th day of June, 1888, there had been coined $299,708,790; and of\r\nthis $55,829,303 was in circulation in coin, and $200,387,376 in silver\r\ncertificates, for the redemption of which silver dollars to that amount\r\nwere held by the Government.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th day of November, 1888, $312,570,990 had been coined,\r\n$60,970,990 of the silver dollars were actually in circulation, and\r\n$237,418,346 in certificates.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary recommends the suspension of the further coinage of silver,\r\nand in such recommendation I earnestly concur.\r\n\r\nFor further valuable information and timely recommendations I ask the\r\ncareful attention of the Congress to the Secretary's report.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War reports that the Army at the date of the last\r\nconsolidated returns consisted of 2,189 officers and 24,549 enlisted men.\r\n\r\nThe actual expenditures of the War Department for the fiscal year ended\r\nJune 30, 1888, amounted to $41,165,107.07, of which sum $9,158,516.63 was\r\nexpended for public works, including river and harbor improvements.\r\n\r\n\"The Board of Ordnance and Fortifications\" provided for under the act\r\napproved September 22 last was convened October 30, 1888, and plans and\r\nspecifications for procuring forgings for 8, 10, and 12 inch guns, under\r\nprovisions of section 4, and also for procuring 12-inch breech-loading\r\nmortars, cast iron, hooped with steel, under the provisions of section 5 of\r\nthe said act, were submitted to the Secretary of War for reference to the\r\nboard, by the Ordnance Department, on the same date.\r\n\r\nThese plans and specifications having been promptly approved by the board\r\nand the Secretary of War, the necessary authority to publish advertisements\r\ninviting proposals in the newspapers throughout the country was granted by\r\nthe Secretary on November 12, and on November 13 the advertisements were\r\nsent out to the different newspapers designated. The bids for the steel\r\nforgings are to be opened on December 20, 1888, and for the mortars on\r\nDecember 15, 1888.\r\n\r\nA board of ordnance officers was convened at the Watervliet Arsenal on\r\nOctober 4, 1888, to prepare the necessary plans and specifications for the\r\nestablishment of an army gun factory at that point. The preliminary report\r\nof this board, with estimates for shop buildings and officers' quarters,\r\nwas approved by the Board of Ordnance and Fortifications November 6 and 8.\r\nThe specifications and form of advertisement and instructions to bidders\r\nhave been prepared, and advertisements inviting proposals for the\r\nexcavations for the shop building and for erecting the two sets of\r\nofficers' quarters have been published. The detailed drawings and\r\nspecifications for the gun-factory building are well in hand, and will be\r\nfinished within three or four months, when bids will be invited for the\r\nerection of the building. The list of machines, etc., is made out, and it\r\nis expected that the plans for the large lathes, etc., will be completed\r\nwithin about four months, and after approval by the Board of Ordnance and\r\nFortifications bids for furnishing the same will be invited. The machines\r\nand other fixtures will be completed as soon as the shop is in readiness to\r\nreceive them, probably about July, 1890.\r\n\r\nUnder the provisions of the Army bill for the procurement of pneumatic\r\ndynamite guns, the necessary specifications are now being prepared, and\r\nadvertisements for proposals will issue early in December. The guns will\r\nprobably be of 15 inches caliber and fire a projectile that will carry a\r\ncharge each of about 500 pounds of explosive gelatine with full-caliber\r\nprojectiles. The guns will probably be delivered in from six to ten months\r\nfrom the date of the contract, so that all the guns of this class that can\r\nbe procured under the provisions of the law will be purchased during the\r\nyear 1889.\r\n\r\nI earnestly request that the recommendations contained in the Secretary's\r\nreport, all of which are, in my opinion, calculated to increase the\r\nusefulness and discipline of the Army, may receive the consideration of the\r\nCongress. Among these the proposal that there should be provided a plan for\r\nthe examination of officers to test their fitness for promotion is of the\r\nutmost importance. This reform has been before recommended in the reports\r\nof the Secretary, and its expediency is so fully demonstrated by the\r\nargument he presents in its favor that its adoption should no longer be\r\nneglected.\r\n\r\nThe death of General Sheridan in August last was a national affliction. The\r\nArmy then lost the grandest of its chiefs. The country lost a brave and\r\nexperienced soldier, a wise and discreet counselor, and a modest and\r\nsensible man. Those who in any manner came within the range of his personal\r\nassociation will never fail to pay deserved and willing homage to his\r\ngreatness and the glory of his career, but they will cherish with more\r\ntender sensibility the loving memory of his simple, generous, and\r\nconsiderate nature.\r\n\r\nThe Apache Indians, whose removal from their reservation in Arizona\r\nfollowed the capture of those of their number who engaged in a bloody\r\nand murderous raid during a part of the years 1885 and 1886, are now held\r\nas prisoners of war at Mount Vernon Barracks, in the State of Alabama. They\r\nnumbered on the 31st day of October, the date of the last report, 83 men,\r\n170 women, 70 boys, and 59 girls; in all, 382 persons. The commanding\r\nofficer states that they are in good health and contented, and that they\r\nare kept employed as fully as is possible in the circumstances. The\r\nchildren, as they arrive at a suitable age, are sent to the Indian schools\r\nat Carlisle and Hampton.\r\n\r\nLast summer some charitable and kind people asked permission to send two\r\nteachers to these Indians for the purpose of instructing the adults as well\r\nas such children as should be found there. Such permission was readily\r\ngranted, accommodations were provided for the teachers, and some portions\r\nof the buildings at the barracks were made available for school purposes.\r\nThe good work contemplated has been commenced, and the teachers engaged are\r\npaid by the ladies with whom the plan originated.\r\n\r\nI am not at all in sympathy with those benevolent but injudicious people\r\nwho are constantly insisting that these Indians should be returned to their\r\nreservation. Their removal was an absolute necessity if the lives and\r\nproperty of citizens upon the frontier are to be at all regarded by the\r\nGovernment. Their continued restraint at a distance from the scene of their\r\nrepeated and cruel murders and outrages is still necessary. It is a\r\nmistaken philanthropy, every way injurious, which prompts the desire to see\r\nthese savages returned to their old haunts. They are in their present\r\nlocation as the result of the best judgment of those having official\r\nresponsibility in the matter, and who are by no means lacking in kind\r\nconsideration for the Indians. A number of these prisoners have forfeited\r\ntheir lives to outraged law and humanity. Experience has proved that they\r\nare dangerous and can not be trusted. This is true not only of those who on\r\nthe warpath have heretofore actually been guilty of atrocious murder, but\r\nof their kindred and friends, who, while they remained upon their\r\nreservation, furnished aid and comfort to those absent with bloody intent.\r\n\r\nThese prisoners should be treated kindly and kept in restraint far from the\r\nlocality of their former reservation; they should be subjected to efforts\r\ncalculated to lead to their improvement and the softening of their savage\r\nand cruel instincts, but their return to their old home should be\r\npersistently resisted.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary in his report gives a graphic history of these Indians, and\r\nrecites with painful vividness their bloody deeds and the unhappy failure\r\nof the Government to manage them by peaceful means. It will be amazing if a\r\nperusal of this history will allow the survival of a desire for the return\r\nof these prisoners to their reservation upon sentimental or any other\r\ngrounds.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy demonstrates very intelligent\r\nmanagement in that important Department, and discloses the most\r\nsatisfactory progress in the work of reconstructing the Navy made during\r\nthe past year. Of the ships in course of construction five, viz, the\r\nCharleston, Baltimore, Yorktown, Vesuvius, and the Petrel, have in that\r\ntime been launched and are rapidly approaching completion; and in addition\r\nto the above, the Philadelphia, the San Francisco, the Newark, the\r\nBennington, the Concord, and the Herreshoff torpedo boat are all under\r\ncontract for delivery to the Department during the next year. The progress\r\nalready made and being made gives good ground for the expectation that\r\nthese eleven vessels will be incorporated as part of the American Navy\r\nwithin the next twelve months.\r\n\r\nThe report shows that notwithstanding the large expenditures for new\r\nconstruction and the additional labor they involve the total ordinary or\r\ncurrent expenditures of the Department for the three years ending June 30,\r\n1888, are less by more than 20 per cent than such expenditures for the\r\nthree years ending June 30, 1884.\r\n\r\nThe various steps which have been taken to improve the business methods of\r\nthe Department are reviewed by the Secretary. The purchasing of supplies\r\nhas been consolidated and placed under a responsible bureau head. This has\r\nresulted in the curtailment of open purchases, which in the years 1884 and\r\n1885 amounted to over 50 per cent of all the purchases of the Department,\r\nto less than 11 per cent; so that at the present time about 90 per cent of\r\nthe total departmental purchases are made by contract and after\r\ncompetition. As the expenditures on this account exceed an average of\r\n$2,000,000 annually, it is evident that an important improvement in the\r\nsystem has been inaugurated and substantial economies introduced.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General shows a marked increase of business in\r\nevery branch of the postal service.\r\n\r\nThe number of post-offices on July 1, 1888, was 57,376, an increase of\r\n6,124 in three years and of 2,219 for the last fiscal year. The\r\nlatter-mentioned increase is classified as follows:\r\n\r\nNew England States -\r\n\r\nMiddle States - 181\r\n\r\nSouthern States and Indian Territory (41) - 1,406\r\n\r\nThe States and Territories of the Pacific Coast - 190\r\n\r\nThe ten States and Territories of the West and Northwest - 435\r\n\r\nDistrict of Columbia - 2\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nGrover Cleveland\r\nDecember 4, 1893\r\n\r\nTo the Congress of the United States:\r\n\r\nThe constitutional duty which requires the President from time to time\r\nto give to the Congress information of the state of the Union and\r\nrecommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge\r\nnecessary and expedient is fittingly entered upon by commending to the\r\nCongress a careful examination of the detailed statements and\r\nwell-supported recommendations contained in the reports of the heads of\r\nDepartments, who are chiefly charged with the executive work of the\r\nGovernment. In an effort to abridge this communication as much as is\r\nconsistent with its purpose I shall supplement a brief reference to the\r\ncontents of these departmental reports by the mention of such executive\r\nbusiness and incidents as are not embraced therein and by such\r\nrecommendations as appear to be at this particular time appropriate.\r\n\r\nWhile our foreign relations have not at all times during the past year\r\nbeen entirely free from perplexity, no embarrassing situation remains\r\nthat will not yield to the spirit of fairness and love of justice\r\nwhich, joined with consistent firmness, characterize a truly American\r\nforeign policy.\r\n\r\nMy predecessor having accepted the office of arbitrator of the\r\nlong-standing Missions boundary dispute, tendered to the President by\r\nthe Argentine Republic and Brazil, it has been my agreeable duty to\r\nreceive the special envoys commissioned by those States to lay before\r\nme evidence and arguments in behalf of their respective Governments.\r\n\r\nThe outbreak of domestic hostilities in the Republic of Brazil found\r\nthe United States alert to watch the interests of our citizens in that\r\ncountry, with which we carry on important commerce. Several vessels of\r\nour new Navy are now and for some time have been stationed at Rio de\r\nJaneiro. The struggle being between the established Government, which\r\ncontrols the machinery of administration, and with which we maintain\r\nfriendly relations, and certain officers of the navy employing the\r\nvessels of their command in an attack upon the national capital and\r\nchief seaport, and lacking as it does the elements of divided\r\nadministration, I have failed to see that the insurgents can reasonably\r\nclaim recognition as belligerents.\r\n\r\nThus far the position of our Government has been that of an attentive\r\nbut impartial observer of the unfortunate conflict. Emphasizing our\r\nfixed policy of impartial neutrality in such a condition of affairs as\r\nnow exists, I deemed it necessary to disavow in a manner not to be\r\nmisunderstood the unauthorized action of our late naval commander in\r\nthose waters in saluting the revolted Brazilian admiral, being\r\nindisposed to countenance an act calculated to give gratuitous sanction\r\nto the local insurrection.\r\n\r\nThe convention between our Government and Chile having for its object\r\nthe settlement and adjustment of the demand of the two countries\r\nagainst each other has been made effective by he organization of the\r\nclaims commission provided for. The two Governments failing to agree\r\nupon the third member of the commission, the good offices of the\r\nPresident of the Swiss Republic were invoked, as provided in the\r\ntreaty, and the selection of the Swiss representative in this country\r\nto complete the organization was gratifying alike to the United States\r\nand Chile.\r\n\r\nThe vexatious question of so-called legation asylum for offenders\r\nagainst the state and its laws was presented anew in Chile by the\r\nunauthorized action of the late United States minister in receiving\r\ninto his official residence two persons who had just failed in an\r\nattempt at revolution and against whom criminal charges were pending\r\ngrowing out of a former abortive disturbance. The doctrine of asylum as\r\napplied to this case is not sanctioned by the best precedents, and when\r\nallowed tends to encourage sedition and strife. Under no circumstances\r\ncan the representatives of this Government be permitted, under the\r\nill-defined fiction of extraterritoriality, to interrupt the\r\nadministration of criminal justice in the countries to which they are\r\naccredited. A temperate demand having been made by the Chilean\r\nGovernment for the correction of this conduct in the instance\r\nmentioned, the minister was instructed no longer to harbor the\r\noffenders.\r\n\r\nThe legislation of last year known as the Geary law, requiring the\r\nregistration of all Chinese laborers entitled to residence in the\r\nUnited States and the deportation of all not complying with the\r\nprovisions of the act within the time prescribed, met with much\r\nopposition from Chinamen in this country. Acting upon the advice of\r\neminent counsel that the law was unconstitutional, the great mass of\r\nChinese laborers, pending judicial inquiry as to its validity, in good\r\nfaith declined to apply for the certificates required by its\r\nprovisions. A test case upon proceeding by habeas corpus was brought\r\nbefore the Supreme Court, and on May 15, 1893, a decision was made by\r\nthat tribunal sustaining the law.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that under the recent amendment of the act extending the\r\ntime for registration the Chinese laborers thereto entitled who desire\r\nto reside in this country will now avail themselves of the renewed\r\nprivilege thus afforded of establishing by lawful procedure their right\r\nto remain, and that thereby the necessity of enforced deportation may\r\nto a great degree be avoided.\r\n\r\nIt has devolved upon the United States minister at Peking, as dean of\r\nthe diplomatic body, and in the absence of a representative of Sweden\r\nand Norway, to press upon the Chinese Government reparation for the\r\nrecent murder of Swedish missionaries at Sung-pu. This question is of\r\nvital interest to all countries whose citizens engage in missionary\r\nwork in the interior.\r\n\r\nBy Article XII of the general act of Brussels, signed July 2, 1890, for\r\nthe suppression of the slave trade and the restriction of certain\r\ninjurious commerce in the Independent State of the Kongo and in the\r\nadjacent zone of central Africa, the United States and the other\r\nsignatory powers agreed to adopt appropriate means for the punishment\r\nof persons selling arms and ammunition to the natives and for the\r\nconfiscation of the inhibited articles. It being the plain duty of this\r\nGovernment to aid in suppressing the nefarious traffic, impairing as it\r\ndoes the praiseworthy and civilizing efforts now in progress in that\r\nregion, I recommend that an act be passed prohibiting the sale of arms\r\nand intoxicants to natives in the regulated zone by our citizens.\r\n\r\nCosta Rica has lately testified its friendliness by surrendering to the\r\nUnited States, in the absence of a convention of extradition, but upon\r\nduly submitted evidence of criminality, a noted fugitive from justice.\r\nIt is trusted that the negotiation of a treaty with that country to\r\nmeet recurring cases of this kind will soon be accomplished. In my\r\nopinion treaties for reciprocal extradition should be concluded with\r\nall those countries with which the United States has not already\r\nconventional arrangements of that character.\r\n\r\nI have deemed it fitting to express to the Governments of Costa Rica\r\nand Colombia the kindly desire of the United States to see their\r\npending boundary dispute finally closed by arbitration in conformity\r\nwith the spirit of the treaty concluded between them some years ago.\r\n\r\nOur relations with the French Republic continue to be intimate and\r\ncordial. I sincerely hope that the extradition treaty with that\r\ncountry, as amended by the Senate, will soon be operative.\r\n\r\nWhile occasional questions affecting our naturalized citizens returning\r\nto the land of their birth have arisen in our intercourse with Germany,\r\nour relations with that country continue satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe questions affecting our relations with Great Britain have been\r\ntreated in a spirit of friendliness.\r\n\r\nNegotiations are in progress between the two Governments with a view to\r\nsuch concurrent action as will make the award and regulations agreed\r\nupon by the Bering Sea Tribunal of Arbitration practically effective,\r\nand it is not doubted that Great Britain will cooperate freely with\r\nthis country for the accomplishment of that purpose.\r\n\r\nThe dispute growing out of the discriminating tolls imposed in the\r\nWelland Canal upon cargoes of cereals bound to and from the lake ports\r\nof the United States was adjusted by the substitution of a more\r\nequitable schedule of charges, and my predecessor thereupon suspended\r\nhis proclamation imposing discriminating tolls upon British transit\r\nthrough our canals.\r\n\r\nA request for additions to the list of extraditable offenses covered by\r\nthe existing treaty between the two countries is under consideration.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year an American citizen employed in a subordinate\r\ncommercial position in Hayti, after suffering a protracted imprisonment\r\non an unfounded charge of smuggling, was finally liberated on judicial\r\nexamination. Upon urgent representation to the Haytian Government a\r\nsuitable indemnity was paid to the sufferer.\r\n\r\nBy a law of Hayti a sailing vessel, having discharged her cargo, is\r\nrefused clearance until the duties on such cargo have been paid. The\r\nhardship of this measure upon American shipowners, who conduct the bulk\r\nof the carrying trade of that country, has been insisted on with a view\r\nof securing the removal of this cause of complaint.\r\n\r\nUpon receiving authentic information of the firing upon an American\r\nmail steamer touching at the port of Amapala because her captain\r\nrefused to deliver up a passenger in transit from Nicaragua to\r\nGuatemala upon demand of the military authorities of Honduras, our\r\nminister to that country, under instructions, protested against the\r\nwanton act and demanded satisfaction. The Government of Honduras,\r\nactuated by a sense of justice and in a spirit of the utmost\r\nfriendship, promptly disavowed the illegal conduct of its officers and\r\nexpressed sincere regret for the occurrence.\r\n\r\nIt is confidently anticipated that a satisfactory adjustment will soon\r\nbe reached of the questions arising out of the seizure and use of\r\nAmerican vessels by insurgents in Honduras and the subsequent denial by\r\nthe successful Government of commercial privileges to those vessels on\r\nthat account.\r\n\r\nA notable part of the southeasterly coast of Liberia between the\r\nCavally and San Pedro rivers, which for nearly half a century has been\r\ngenerally recognized as belonging to that Republic by cession and\r\npurchase, has been claimed to be under the protectorate of France in\r\nvirtue of agreements entered into by the native tribes, over whom\r\nLiberia's control has not been well maintained.\r\n\r\nMore recently negotiations between the Liberian representative and the\r\nFrench Government resulted in the signature at Paris of a treaty\r\nwhereby as an adjustment certain Liberian territory is ceded to France.\r\nThis convention at last advices had not been ratified by the Liberian\r\nLegislature and Executive.\r\n\r\nFeeling a sympathetic interest in the fortunes of the little\r\nCommonwealth, the establishment and development of which were largely\r\naided by the benevolence of our countrymen, and which constitutes the\r\nonly independently sovereign state on the west coast of Africa, this\r\nGovernment has suggested to the French Government its earnest concern\r\nlest territorial impairment in Liberia should take place without her\r\nunconstrained consent.\r\n\r\nOur relations with Mexico continue to be of that close and friendly\r\nnature which should always characterize the intercourse of two\r\nneighboring republics.\r\n\r\nThe work of relocating the monuments marking the boundary between the\r\ntwo countries from Paso del Norte to the Pacific is now nearly\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\nThe commission recently organized under the conventions of 1884 and\r\n1889 it is expected will speedily settle disputes growing out of the\r\nshifting currents of the Rio Grande River east of E1 Paso.\r\n\r\nNicaragua has recently passed through two revolutions, the party at\r\nfirst successful having in turn been displaced by another. Our newly\r\nappointed minister by his timely good offices aided in a peaceful\r\nadjustment of the controversy involved in the first conflict. The large\r\nAmerican interests established in that country in connection with the\r\nNicaragua Canal were not molested.\r\n\r\nThe canal company has unfortunately become financially seriously\r\nembarrassed, but a generous treatment had been extended to it by the\r\nGovernment of Nicaragua. The United States are especially interested in\r\nthe successful achievement of the vast undertaking this company has in\r\ncharge. That it should be accomplished under distinctively American\r\nauspices, and its enjoyment assured not only to the vessels of this\r\ncountry as a channel of communication between our Atlantic and Pacific\r\nsea-boards, but to the ships of the world in the interests of\r\ncivilization, is a proposition which, in my judgment, does not admit of\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nGuatemala has also been visited by the political vicissitudes which\r\nhave afflicted her Central American neighbors, but the dissolution of\r\nits Legislature and the proclamation of a dictatorship have been\r\nunattended with civil war.\r\n\r\nAn extradition treaty with Norway has recently been exchanged and\r\nproclaimed.\r\n\r\nThe extradition treaty with Russia signed in March, 1887, and amended\r\nand confirmed by the Senate in February last, was duly proclaimed last\r\nJune.\r\n\r\nLed by a desire to compose differences and contribute to the\r\nrestoration of order in Samoa, which for some years previous had been\r\nthe scene of conflicting foreign pretensions and native strife, the\r\nUnited States, departing from its policy consecrated by a century of\r\nobservance, entered four years ago into the treaty of Berlin, thereby\r\nbecoming jointly bound with England and Germany to establish and\r\nmaintain Malietoa Laupepa as King of Samoa. The treaty provided for a\r\nforeign court of justice; a municipal council for the district of Apia,\r\nwith a foreign president thereof, authorized to advise the King; a\r\ntribunal for the settlement of native and foreign land titles, and a\r\nrevenue system for the Kingdom. It entailed upon the three powers that\r\npart of the cost of the new Government not met by the revenue of the\r\nislands.\r\n\r\nEarly in the life of this triple protectorate the native dissensions it\r\nwas designed to quell revived. Rivals defied the authority of the new\r\nKing, refusing to pay taxes and demanding the election of a ruler by\r\nnative suffrage. Mataafa, an aspirant to the throne, and a large number\r\nof his native adherents were in open rebellion on one of the islands.\r\nQuite lately, at the request of the other powers and in fulfillment of\r\nits treaty obligation, this Government agreed to unite in a joint\r\nmilitary movement of such dimensions as would probably secure the\r\nsurrender of the insurgents without bloodshed.\r\n\r\nThe war ship Philadelphia was accordingly put under orders for Samoa,\r\nbut before she arrived the threatened conflict was precipitated by King\r\nMalietoa's attack upon the insurgent camp. Mataafa was defeated and a\r\nnumber of his men killed. The British and German naval vessels present\r\nsubsequently secured the surrender of Mataafa and his adherents. The\r\ndefeated chief and ten of his principal supporters were deported to a\r\nGerman island of the Marshall group, where they are held as prisoners\r\nunder the joint responsibility and cost of the three powers.\r\n\r\nThis incident and the events leading up to it signally illustrate the\r\nimpolicy of entangling alliances with foreign powers.\r\n\r\nMore than fifteen years ago this Government preferred a claim against\r\nSpain in behalf of one of our citizens for property seized and\r\nconfiscated in Cuba. In 1886 the claim was adjusted, Spain agreeing to\r\npay unconditionally, as a fair indemnity, $1,500,000. A respectful but\r\nearnest note was recently addressed to the Spanish Government insisting\r\nupon prompt fulfillment of its long-neglected obligation.\r\n\r\nOther claims preferred by the United States against Spain in behalf of\r\nAmerican citizens for property confiscated in Cuba have been pending\r\nfor many years.\r\n\r\nAt the time Spain's title to the Caroline Islands was confirmed by\r\narbitration that Government agreed that the rights which had been\r\nacquired there by American missionaries should be recognized and\r\nrespected. It is sincerely hoped that this pledge will be observed by\r\nallowing our missionaries, who were removed from Ponape to a place of\r\nsafety by a United States war ship during the late troubles between the\r\nSpanish garrison and the natives, to return to their field of\r\nusefulness.\r\n\r\nThe reproduced caravel Santa Maria, built by Spain and sent to the\r\nColumbian Exposition, has been presented to the United States in token\r\nof amity and in commemoration of the event it was designed to\r\ncelebrate. I recommend that in accepting this gift Congress make\r\ngrateful recognition of the sincere friendship which prompted it.\r\n\r\nImportant matters have demanded attention in our relations with the\r\nOttoman Porte.\r\n\r\nThe firing and partial destruction by an unrestrained mob of one of the\r\nschool buildings of Anatolia College, established by citizens of the\r\nUnited States at Marsovan, and the apparent indifference of the Turkish\r\nGovernment to the outrage, notwithstanding the complicity of some of\r\nits officials, called for earnest remonstrance, which was followed by\r\npromise of reparation and punishment of the offenders.\r\n\r\nIndemnity for the injury to the buildings has already been paid,\r\npermission to rebuild given, registration of the school property in the\r\nname of the American owners secured, and efficient protection\r\nguaranteed.\r\n\r\nInformation received of maltreatment suffered by an inoffensive\r\nAmerican woman engaged in missionary work in Turkish Koordistan was\r\nfollowed by such representations to the Porte as resulted in the\r\nissuance of orders for the punishment of her assailants, the removal of\r\na delinquent official, and the adoption of measures for the protection\r\nof our citizens engaged in mission and other lawful work in that\r\nquarter.\r\n\r\nTurkey complains that her Armenian subjects obtain citizenship in this\r\ncountry not to identify themselves in good faith with our people, but\r\nwith the intention of returning to the land of their birth and there\r\nengaging in sedition. This complaint is not wholly without foundation.\r\nA journal published in this country in the Armenian language openly\r\ncounsels its readers to arm, organize, and participate in movements for\r\nthe subversion of Turkish authority in the Asiatic provinces. The\r\nOttoman Government has announced its intention to expel from its\r\ndominions Armenians who have obtained naturalization in the United\r\nStates since 1868.\r\n\r\nThe right to exclude any or all classes of aliens is an attribute of\r\nsovereignty. It is a right asserted and, to a limited extent, enforced\r\nby the United States, with the sanction of our highest court. There\r\nbeing no naturalization treaty between the United States and Turkey,\r\nour minister at Constantinople has been instructed that, while\r\nrecognizing the right of that Government to enforce its declared policy\r\nagainst naturalized Armenians, he is expected to protect them from\r\nunnecessary harshness of treatment.\r\n\r\nIn view of the impaired financial resources of Venezuela consequent\r\nupon the recent revolution there, a modified arrangement for the\r\nsatisfaction of the awards of the late revisory claims commission, in\r\nprogressive installments, has been assented to, and payments are being\r\nregularly made thereunder.\r\n\r\nThe boundary dispute between Venezuela and British Guiana is yet\r\nunadjusted. A restoration of diplomatic intercourse between that\r\nRepublic and Great Britain and reference of the question to impartial\r\narbitration would be a most gratifying consummation.\r\n\r\nThe ratification by Venezuela of the convention for the arbitration of\r\nthe long-deferred claim of the Venezuelan Transportation Company is\r\nawaited.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary for me to state that the questions arising from\r\nour relations with Hawaii have caused serious embarrassment. Just prior\r\nto the installation of the present Administration the existing\r\nGovernment of Hawaii had been suddenly overthrown and a treaty of\r\nannexation had been negotiated between the Provisional Government of\r\nthe islands and the United States and submitted to the Senate for\r\nratification. This treaty I withdrew for examination and dispatched\r\nHon. James H. Blount, of Georgia, to Honolulu as a special commissioner\r\nto make an impartial investigation of the circumstances attending the\r\nchange of government and of all the conditions bearing upon the subject\r\nof the treaty. After a thorough and exhaustive examination Mr. Blount\r\nsubmitted to me his report, showing beyond all question that the\r\nconstitutional Government of Hawaii had been subverted with the active\r\naid of our representative to that Government and through the\r\nintimidation caused by the presence of an armed naval force of the\r\nUnited States, which was landed for that purpose at the instance of our\r\nminister. Upon the facts developed it seemed to me the only honorable\r\ncourse for our Government to pursue was to undo the wrong that had been\r\ndone by those representing us and to restore as far as practicable the\r\nstatus existing at the time of our forcible intervention. With a view\r\nof accomplishing this result within the constitutional limits of\r\nexecutive power, and recognizing all our obligations and\r\nresponsibilities growing out of any changed conditions brought about by\r\nour unjustifiable interference, our present minister at Honolulu has\r\nreceived appropriate instructions to that end. Thus far no information\r\nof the accomplishment of any definite results has been received from\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAdditional advices are soon expected. When received they will be\r\npromptly sent to the Congress, together with all other information at\r\nhand, accompanied by a special Executive message fully detailing all\r\nthe facts necessary to a complete understanding of the case and\r\npresenting a history of all the material events leading up to the\r\npresent situation.\r\n\r\nBy a concurrent resolution passed by the Senate February 14, 1890, and\r\nby the House of Representatives on the 3d of April following the\r\nPresident was requested to \"invite from time to time, as fit occasions\r\nmay arise, negotiations with any government with which the United\r\nStates has or may have diplomatic relations, to the end that any\r\ndifferences or disputes arising between the two governments which can\r\nnot be adjusted by diplomatic agency may be referred to arbitration and\r\nbe peaceably adjusted by such means.\" April 18, 1890, the International\r\nAmerican Conference of Washington by resolution expressed the wish that\r\nall controversies between the republics of America and the nations of\r\nEurope might be settled by arbitration, and recommended that the\r\ngovernment of each nation represented in that conference should\r\ncommunicate this wish to all friendly powers. A favorable response has\r\nbeen received from Great Britain in the shape of a resolution adopted\r\nby Parliament July 16 last, cordially sympathizing with the purpose in\r\nview and expressing the hope that Her Majesty's Government will lend\r\nready cooperation to the Government of the United States upon the basis\r\nof the concurrent resolution above quoted.\r\n\r\nIt affords me signal pleasure to lay this parliamentary resolution\r\nbefore the Congress and to express my sincere gratification that the\r\nsentiment of two great and kindred nations is thus authoritatively\r\nmanifested in favor of the rational and peaceable settlement of\r\ninternational quarrels by honorable resort to arbitration.\r\n\r\nSince the-passage of the act of March 3, 1893, authorizing the\r\nPresident to raise the grade of our envoys to correspond with the rank\r\nin which foreign countries accredit their agents here, Great Britain,\r\nFrance, Italy, and Germany have conferred upon their representatives at\r\nthis capital the title of ambassador, and I have responded by\r\naccrediting the agents of the United States in those countries with the\r\nsame title. A like elevation of mission is announced by Russia, and\r\nwhen made will be similarly met. This step fittingly comports with the\r\nposition the United States hold in the family of nations.\r\n\r\nDuring my former Administration I took occasion to recommend a recast\r\nof the laws relating to the consular service, in order that it might\r\nbecome a more efficient agency in the promotion of the interests it was\r\nintended to subserve. The duties and powers of consuls have been\r\nexpanded with the growing requirements of our foreign trade.\r\nDischarging important duties affecting our commerce and American\r\ncitizens abroad, and in certain countries exercising judicial\r\nfunctions, these officers should be men of character, intelligence, and\r\nability.\r\n\r\nUpon proof that the legislation of Denmark secures copyright to\r\nAmerican citizens on equal footing with its own, the privileges of our\r\ncopyright laws have been extended by proclamation to subjects of that\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury reports that the receipts of the\r\nGovernment from all sources during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1893,\r\namounted to $461,716,561.94 and its expenditures to $459,374,674.29.\r\nThere was collected from customs $205,355,016.73 and from internal\r\nrevenue $161,027,623.93. Our dutiable imports amounted to $421,856,711,\r\nan increase of $52,453,907 over the preceding year, and importations\r\nfree of duty amounted to $444,544,211, a decrease from the preceding\r\nyear of $13,455,447. Internal-revenue receipts exceeded those of the\r\npreceding year by $7,147,445.32. The total tax collected on distilled\r\nspirits was $94,720,260.55, on manufactured tobacco $31,889,711.74, and\r\non fermented liquors $32,548,983.07. We exported merchandise during the\r\nyear amounting to $847,665,194, a decrease of $182,612,954 from the\r\npreceding year. The amount of gold exported was larger than any\r\nprevious year in the history of the Government, amounting to\r\n$108,680,844, and exceeding the amount exported during the preceding\r\nyear by$58,485,517.\r\n\r\nThe sum paid from the Treasury for sugar bounty was $9,375,130.88, an\r\nincrease over the preceding year of $2,033,053.09.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated upon the basis of present revenue laws that the\r\nreceipts of the Government for the year ending June 30, 1894, will be\r\n$430,121,365.38 and its expenditures $458,121,365.28, resulting in a\r\ndeficiency of $28,000,000.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st day of November, 1893, the amount of money of all kinds in\r\ncirculation, or not included in Treasury holdings, was $1,718,544,682,\r\nan increase for the year of $112,404,947. Estimating our population at\r\n67,426,000 at the time mentioned, the per capita circulation was\r\n$25.49. On the same date there was in the Treasury gold bullion\r\namounting to $96,657,273 and silver bullion which was purchased at a\r\ncost of $126,261,553.\r\n\r\nThe purchases of silver under the law of July 14, 1890, during the last\r\nfiscal year aggregated 54,008,162.59 fine ounces, which cost\r\n$45,531,374.53. The total amount of silver purchased from the time that\r\nlaw became operative until the repeal of its purchasing clause, on the\r\n1st day of November, 1893, was 168,674,590.46 fine ounces, which cost\r\n$155,930,940.84. Between the 1st day of March, 1873, and the 1st day of\r\nNovember, 1893, the Government purchased under all laws 503,003,717\r\nfine ounces of silver, at a cost of $516,622,948. The silver dollars\r\nthat have been coined under the act of July 14, 1890, number\r\n36,087,285. The seigniorage arising from such coinage was\r\n$6,977,098.39, leaving on hand in the mints 140,699,760 fine ounces of\r\nsilver, which cost $126,758,218.\r\n\r\nOur total coinage of all metals during the last fiscal year consisted\r\nof 97,280,875 pieces, valued at $43,685,178.80, of which there was\r\n$30,038,140 in gold coin, $5,343,715 in silver dollars, $7,217,220.90\r\nin subsidiary silver coin, and $1,086,102.90 in minor coins.\r\n\r\nDuring the calendar year 1892 the production of precious metals in the\r\nUnited States was estimated to be 1,596,375 fine ounces of gold of the\r\ncommercial and coinage value of $33,000,000 and 58,000,000 fine ounces\r\nof silver of the bullion or market value of $50,750,000 and of the\r\ncoinage value of $74,989,900.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that on the 1st day of July, 1893, the metallic stock\r\nof money in the United States, consisting of coin and bullion, amounted\r\nto $1,213,559,169, of which $597,697,685 was gold and $615,861,484 was\r\nsilver.\r\n\r\nOne hundred and nineteen national banks were organized during the year\r\nending October 31, 1893, with a capital of $11,230,000. Forty-six went\r\ninto voluntary liquidation and 158 suspended. Sixty-five of the\r\nsuspended banks were insolvent, 86 resumed business, and 7 remain in\r\nthe hands of the bank examiners, with prospects of speedy resumption.\r\nOf the new banks organized, 44 were located in the Eastern States, 41\r\nwest of the Mississippi River, and 34 in the Central and Southern\r\nStates. The total number of national banks in existence on October 31,\r\n1893, was 3,796, having an aggregate capital of $695,558,120. The net\r\nincrease in the circulation of these banks during the year was\r\n$36,886,972.\r\n\r\nThe recent repeal of the provision of law requiring the purchase of\r\nsilver bullion by the Government as a feature of our monetary scheme\r\nhas made an entire change in the complexion of our currency affairs. I\r\ndo not doubt that the ultimate result of this action will be most\r\nsalutary and far-reaching. In the nature of things, however, it is\r\nimpossible to know at this time precisely what conditions will be\r\nbrought about by the change, or what, if any, supplementary legislation\r\nmay in the light of such conditions appear to be essential or\r\nexpedient. Of course, after the recent financial perturbation, time is\r\nnecessary for the reestablishment of business confidence. When,\r\nhowever, through this restored confidence, the money which has been\r\nfrightened into hoarding places is returned to trade and enterprise, a\r\nsurvey of the situation will probably disclose a safe path leading to a\r\npermanently sound currency, abundantly sufficient to meet every\r\nrequirement of our increasing population and business.\r\n\r\nIn the pursuit of this object we should resolutely turn away from\r\nalluring and temporary expedients, determined to be content with\r\nnothing less than a lasting and comprehensive financial plan. In these\r\ncircumstances I am convinced that a reasonable delay in dealing with\r\nthis subject, instead of being injurious, will increase the probability\r\nof wise action.\r\n\r\nThe monetary conference which assembled at Brussels upon our invitation\r\nwas adjourned to the 30th day of November of the present year. The\r\nconsiderations just stated and the fact that a definite proposition\r\nfrom us seemed to be expected upon the reassembling of the conference\r\nled me to express a willingness to have the meeting still further\r\npostponed.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that it would be wise to give general authority to the\r\nPresident to invite other nations to such a conference at any time when\r\nthere should be a fair prospect of accomplishing an international\r\nagreement on the subject of coinage.\r\n\r\nI desire also to earnestly suggest the wisdom of amending the existing\r\nstatutes in regard to the issuance of Government bonds. The authority\r\nnow vested in the Secretary of the Treasury to issue bonds is not as\r\nclear as it should be, and the bonds authorized are disadvantageous to\r\nthe Government both as to the time of their maturity and rate of\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nThe Superintendent of Immigration, through the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, reports that during the last fiscal year there arrived at our\r\nports 440,793 immigrants. Of these, 1,063 were not permitted to land\r\nunder the limitations of the law and 577 were returned to the countries\r\nfrom whence they came by reason of their having become public charges.\r\nThe total arrivals were 141,034 less than for the previous year.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary in his report gives an account of the operation of the\r\nMarine-Hospital Service and of the good work done under its supervision\r\nin preventing the entrance and spread of contagious diseases.\r\n\r\nThe admonitions of the last two years touching our public health and\r\nthe demonstrated danger of the introduction of contagious diseases from\r\nforeign ports have invested the subject of national quarantine with\r\nincreased interest. A more general and harmonious system than now\r\nexists, acting promptly and directly everywhere and constantly\r\noperating by preventive means to shield our country from the invasion\r\nof disease, and at the same time having due regard to the rights and\r\nduties of local agencies, would, I believe, add greatly to the safety\r\nof our people.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War reports that the strength of the Army on the 30th\r\nday of September last was 25,778 enlisted men and 2,144 officers.\r\n\r\nThe total expenditures of the Department for the year ending June 30,\r\n1893, amounted to $51,966,074.89. Of this sum $1,992,581.95 was for\r\nsalaries and contingent expenses, $23,377,828.35 for the support of the\r\nmilitary establishment, $6,077,033.18 for miscellaneous objects, and\r\n518,631.41 for public works. This latter sum includes $15,296,876.46\r\nfor river and harbor improvements and $3,266,141.20 for fortifications\r\nand other works of defense.\r\n\r\nThe total enrollment of the militia of the several States was on the\r\n31st of October of the current year 112,597 officers and enlisted men.\r\nThe officers of the Army detailed for the inspection and instruction of\r\nthis reserve of our military force report that increased interest and\r\nmarked progress are apparent in the discipline and efficiency of the\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nNeither Indian outbreaks nor domestic violence have called the Army\r\ninto service during the year, and the only active military duty\r\nrequired of it has been in the Department of Texas, where violations of\r\nthe neutrality laws of the United States and Mexico were promptly and\r\nefficiently dealt with by the troops, eliciting the warm approval of\r\nthe civil and military authorities of both countries.\r\n\r\nThe operation of wise laws and the influences of civilization\r\nconstantly tending to relieve the country from the dangers of Indian\r\nhostilities, together with the increasing ability of the States,\r\nthrough the efficiency of the National Guard organizations, to protect\r\ntheir citizens from domestic violence, lead to the suggestion that the\r\ntime is fast approaching when there should be a reorganization of our\r\nArmy on the lines of the present necessities of the country. This\r\nchange contemplates neither increase in number nor added expense, but a\r\nredistribution of the force and an encouragement of measures tending to\r\ngreater efficiency among the men and improvement of the service.\r\n\r\nThe adoption of battalion formations for infantry regiments, the\r\nstrengthening of the artillery force, the abandonment of smaller and\r\nunnecessary posts, and the massing of the troops at important and\r\naccessible stations all promise to promote the usefulness of the Army.\r\nIn the judgment of army officers, with but few exceptions, the\r\noperation of the law forbidding the reenlistment of men after ten\r\nyears' service has not proved its wisdom, and while the arguments that\r\nled to its adoption were not without merit the experience of the year\r\nconstrains me to join in the recommendation for its repeal.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to note that we have begun to attain completed results\r\nin the comprehensive scheme of seacoast defense and fortification\r\nentered upon eight years ago. A large sum has been already expended,\r\nbut the cost of maintenance will be inconsiderable as compared with the\r\nexpense of construction and ordnance. At the end of the current\r\ncalendar year the War Department will have nine 12-inch guns, twenty\r\n10-inch, and thirty-four 8-inch guns ready to be mounted on gun lifts\r\nand carriages, and seventy-five 12-inch mortars. In addition to the\r\nproduct of the Army Gun Factory, now completed at Watervliet, the\r\nGovernment has contracted with private parties for the purchase of one\r\nhundred guns of these calibers, the first of which should be delivered\r\nto the Department for test before July 1, 1894.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of heavy ordnance keeps pace with current needs, but to\r\nrender these guns available for the purposes they are designed to meet\r\nemplacements must be prepared for them. Progress has been made in this\r\ndirection, and it is desirable that Congress by adequate appropriations\r\nshould provide for the uninterrupted prosecution of this necessary work.\r\n\r\nAfter much preliminary work and exhaustive examination in accordance\r\nwith the requirements of the law, the board appointed to select a\r\nmagazine rifle of modern type with which to replace the obsolete\r\nSpringfield rifle of the infantry service completed its labors during\r\nthe last year, and the work of manufacture is now in progress at the\r\nnational armory at Springfield. It is confidently expected that by the\r\nend of the current year our infantry will be supplied with a weapon\r\nequal to that of the most progressive armies of the world.\r\n\r\nThe work on the projected Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military\r\nPark has been prosecuted with zeal and judgment, and its opening will\r\nbe celebrated during the coming year. Over 9 square miles of the\r\nChickamauga battlefield have been acquired, 25 miles of roadway have\r\nbeen constructed, and permanent tablets have been placed at many\r\nhistorical points, while the invitation to the States to mark the\r\npositions of their troops participating in the battle has been very\r\ngenerally accepted.\r\n\r\nThe work of locating and preserving the lines of battle at the\r\nGettysburg battlefield is making satisfactory progress on the plans\r\ndirected by the last Congress.\r\n\r\nThe reports of the Military Academy at West Point and the several\r\nschools for special instruction of officers show marked advance in the\r\neducation of the Army and a commendable ambition among its officers to\r\nexcel in the military profession and to fit themselves for the highest\r\nservice to the country.\r\n\r\nUnder the supervision of Adjutant-General Robert Williams, lately\r\nretired, the Bureau of Military Information has become well established\r\nand is performing a service that will put in possession of the\r\nGovernment in time of war most valuable information, and at all times\r\nserve a purpose of great utility in keeping the Army advised of the\r\nworld's progress in all matters pertaining to the art of war.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Attorney-General contains the usual summary of the\r\naffairs and proceedings of the Department of Justice for the past year,\r\ntogether with certain recommendations as to needed legislation on\r\nvarious subjects. I can not too heartily indorse the proposition that\r\nthe fee system as applicable to the compensation of United States\r\nattorneys, marshals, clerks of Federal courts, and United States\r\ncommissioners should be abolished with as little delay as possible. It\r\nis clearly in the interest of the community that the business of the\r\ncourts, both civil and criminal, shall be as small and as inexpensively\r\ntransacted as the ends of justice will allow.\r\n\r\nThe system is therefore thoroughly vicious which makes the compensation\r\nof court officials depend upon the volume of such business, and thus\r\ncreates a conflict between a proper execution of the law and private\r\ngain, which can not fail to be dangerous to the rights and freedom of\r\nthe citizen and an irresistible temptation to the unjustifiable\r\nexpenditure of public funds. If in addition to this reform another was\r\ninaugurated which would give to United States commissioners the final\r\ndisposition of petty offenses within the grade of misdemeanors,\r\nespecially those coming under the internal-revenue laws, a great\r\nadvance would be made toward a more decent administration of the\r\ncriminal law.\r\n\r\nIn my first message to Congress, dated December 8, 1885, I strongly\r\nrecommended these changes and referred somewhat at length to the evils\r\nof the present system. Since that time the criminal business of the\r\nFederal courts and the expense attending it have enormously increased.\r\nThe number of criminal prosecutions pending in the circuit and district\r\ncourts of the United States on the 1st day of July, 1885, was 3,808, of\r\nwhich 1,884 were for violations of the internal-revenue laws, while the\r\nnumber of such prosecutions pending on the 1st day of July, 1893, was\r\n9,500, of which 4,200 were for violations of the internal-revenue laws.\r\nThe expense of the United States courts, exclusive of judges' salaries,\r\nfor the year ending July 1, 1885, was $2,874,733.11 and for the year\r\nending July 1, 1893, $4,528,676.87.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore apparent that the reasons given in 1885 for a change in\r\nthe manner of enforcing the Federal criminal law have gained cogency\r\nand strength by lapse of time.\r\n\r\nI also heartily join the Attorney-General in recommending legislation\r\nfixing degrees of the crime of murder within Federal jurisdiction, as\r\nhas been done in many of the States; authorizing writs of error on\r\nbehalf of the Government in cases where final judgment is rendered\r\nagainst the sufficiency of an indictment or against the Government upon\r\nany other question arising before actual trial; limiting the right of\r\nreview in cases of felony punishable only by fine and imprisonment to\r\nthe circuit court of appeals, and making speedy provision for the\r\nconstruction of such prisons and reformatories as may be necessary for\r\nthe confinement of United States convicts.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General contains a detailed statement of\r\nthe operations of the Post-Office Department during the last fiscal\r\nyear and much interesting information touching this important branch of\r\nthe public service.\r\n\r\nThe business of the mails indicates with absolute certainty the\r\ncondition of the business of the country, and depression in financial\r\naffairs inevitably and quickly reduces the postal revenues. Therefore a\r\nlarger discrepancy than usual between the post-office receipts and\r\nexpenditures is the expected and unavoidable result of the distressing\r\nstringency which has prevailed throughout the country during much of\r\nthe time covered by the Postmaster-General's report. At a date when\r\nbetter times were anticipated it was estimated by his predecessor that\r\nthe deficiency on the 30th day of June, 1893, would be but a little\r\nover a million and a half dollars. It amounted, however, to more than\r\nfive millions. At the same time and under the influence of like\r\nanticipations estimates were made for the current fiscal year, ending\r\nJune 30, 1894, which exhibited a surplus of revenue over expenditures\r\nof $872,245.71; but now, in view of the actual receipts and\r\nexpenditures during that part of the current fiscal year already\r\nexpired, the present Postmaster-General estimates that at its close\r\ninstead of a surplus there will be a deficiency of nearly $8,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe post-office receipts for the last fiscal year amounted to\r\n$75,896,933.16 and its expenditures to $81,074,104.90. This post-office\r\ndeficiency would disappear or be immensely decreased if less matter\r\nwere carried free through the mails, an item of which is upward of 300\r\ntons of seeds and grain from the Agricultural Department.\r\n\r\nThe total number of post-offices in the United States on the 30th day\r\nof June, 1893, was 68,403, an increase of 1,284 over the preceding\r\nyear. Of these, 3,360 were Presidential, an increase in that class of\r\n204 over the preceding year.\r\n\r\nForty-two free-delivery offices were added during the year to those\r\nalready existing, making a total of 610 cities and towns provided with\r\nfree delivery on June 30, 1893. Ninety-three other cities and towns are\r\nnow entitled to this service under the law, but it has not been\r\naccorded them on account of insufficient funds to meet the expenses of\r\nits establishment.\r\n\r\nI am decidedly of the opinion that the provisions of the present law\r\npermit as general an introduction of this feature of mail service as is\r\nnecessary or justifiable, and that it ought not to be extended to\r\nsmaller communities than are now designated.\r\n\r\nThe expenses of free delivery for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1894,\r\nwill be more than $11,000,000, and under legislation now existing there\r\nmust be a constant increase in this item of expenditure.\r\n\r\nThere were 6,401 additions to the domestic money-order offices during\r\nthe last fiscal year, being the largest increase in any year since the\r\ninauguration of the system. The total number of these offices at the\r\nclose of the year was 18,434. There were 13,309,735 money orders issued\r\nfrom these offices, being an increase over the preceding year of\r\n1,240,293, and the value of these orders amounted to $127,576,433.65,\r\nan increase of $7,509,632.58. There were also issued during the year\r\npostal notes amounting to $12,903,076.73.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 195 international money-order offices were added to\r\nthose already provided, making a total of 2,407 in operation on June\r\n30, 1893. The number of international money orders issued during the\r\nyear was 1,055,999, an increase over the preceding year of 72,525, and\r\ntheir value was $16,341,837.86, an increase of $2,221,506.31. The\r\nnumber of orders paid was 300,917, an increase over the preceding year\r\nof 13,503, and their value was $5,283,375.70, an increase of $94,094.83.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing statements it appears that the total issue of money\r\norders and postal notes for the year amounted to $156,822,348.24.\r\n\r\nThe number of letters and packages mailed during the year for special\r\ndelivery was 3,375,693, an increase over the preceding year of nearly\r\n22 per cent. The special-delivery stamps used upon these letters and\r\npackages amounted to $337,569.30, and the messengers' fees paid for\r\ntheir delivery amounted to $256,592.71, leaving a profit to the\r\nGovernment of $80,976.59.\r\n\r\nThe Railway Mail Service not only adds to the promptness of mail\r\ndelivery at all offices, but it is the especial instrumentality which\r\nputs the smaller and way places in the service on an equality in that\r\nregard with the larger and terminal offices. This branch of the postal\r\nservice has therefore received much attention from the\r\nPostmaster-General, and though it is gratifying to know that it is in a\r\ncondition of high efficiency and great usefulness, I am led to agree\r\nwith the Postmaster-General that there is room for its further\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\nThere are now connected to the Post-Office establishment 28,324\r\nemployees who are in the classified service. The head of this great\r\nDepartment gives conclusive evidence of the value of civil-service\r\nreform when, after an experience that renders his judgment on the\r\nsubject absolutely reliable, he expresses the opinion that without the\r\nbenefit of this system it would be impossible to conduct the vast\r\nbusiness intrusted to him.\r\n\r\nI desire to commend as especially worthy of prompt attention the\r\nsuggestions of the Postmaster-General relating to a more sensible and\r\nbusiness like organization and a better distribution of responsibility\r\nin his Department.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy contains a history of the\r\noperations of his Department during the past year and exhibits a most\r\ngratifying condition of the personnel of our Navy. He presents a\r\nsatisfactory account of the progress which has been made in the\r\nconstruction of vessels and makes a number of recommendations to which\r\nattention is especially invited.\r\n\r\nDuring the past six months the demands for cruising vessels have been\r\nmany and urgent. There have been revolutions calling for vessels to\r\nprotect American interests in Nicaragua, Guatemala, Costa Rica,\r\nHonduras, Argentina, and Brazil, while the condition of affairs in\r\nHonolulu has required the constant presence of one or more ships. With\r\nall these calls upon our Navy it became necessary, in order to make up\r\na sufficient fleet to patrol the Bering Sea under the modus vivendi\r\nagreed upon with Great Britain, to detail to that service one vessel\r\nfrom the Fish Commission and three from the Revenue Marine.\r\n\r\nProgress in the construction of new vessels has not been as rapid as\r\nwas anticipated. There have been delays in the completion of unarmored\r\nvessels, but for the most part they have been such as are constantly\r\noccurring even in countries having the largest experience in naval\r\nshipbuilding. The most serious delays, however, have been in the work\r\nupon armored ships. The trouble has been the failure of contractors to\r\ndeliver armor as agreed. The difficulties seem now, however, to have\r\nbeen all overcome, and armor is being delivered with satisfactory\r\npromptness. As a result of the experience acquired by shipbuilders and\r\ndesigners and material men, it is believed that the dates when vessels\r\nwill be completed can now be estimated with reasonable accuracy. Great\r\nguns, rapid-fire guns, torpedoes, and powder are being promptly\r\nsupplied.\r\n\r\nThe following vessels of the new Navy have been completed and are now\r\nready for service: The double-turreted coast-defense monitor\r\nMiantonomoh, the double-turreted coast-defense monitor Monterey, the\r\narmored cruiser New York, the protected cruisers Baltimore, Chicago,\r\nPhiladelphia, Newark, San Francisco, Charleston, Atlanta, and Boston,\r\nthe cruiser Detroit, the gunboats Yorktown, Concord, Bennington,\r\nMachias, Castine, and Petrel, the dispatch vessel Dolphin, the practice\r\nvessel Bancroft, and the dynamite gunboat Vesuvius. Of these the\r\nBancroft, Machias, Detroit, and Castine have been placed in commission\r\nduring the current calendar year.\r\n\r\nThe following vessels are in process of construction: The second-class\r\nbattle ships Maine and Texas, the cruisers Montgomery and Marblehead,\r\nand the coast-defense monitors Terror, Puritan, Amphitrite, and\r\nMonadnock, all of which will be completed within one year; the\r\nharbor-defense ram Katahdin and the protected cruisers Columbia,\r\nMinneapolis, Olympia, Cincinnati, and Raleigh, all of which will be\r\ncompleted prior to July 1, 1895; the first-class battle ships Iowa,\r\nIndiana, Massachusetts, and Oregon, which will be completed February 1,\r\n1896, and the armored cruiser Brooklyn, which will be completed by\r\nAugust 1 of that year. It is also expected that the three gunboats\r\nauthorized by the last Congress will be completed in less than two\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nSince 1886 Congress has at each session authorized the building of one\r\nor more vessels, and the Secretary of the Navy presents an earnest plea\r\nfor the continuance of this plan. He recommends the authorization of at\r\nleast one battle ship and six torpedo boats.\r\n\r\nWhile I am distinctly in favor of consistently pursuing the policy we\r\nhave inaugurated of building up a thorough and efficient Navy, I can\r\nnot refrain from the suggestion that the Congress should carefully take\r\ninto account the number of unfinished vessels on our hands and the\r\ndepleted condition of our Treasury in considering the propriety of an\r\nappropriation at this time to begin new work.\r\n\r\nThe method of employing mechanical labor at navy-yards through boards\r\nof labor and making efficiency the sole test by which laborers are\r\nemployed and continued is producing the best results, and the Secretary\r\nis earnestly devoting himself to its development. Attention is invited\r\nto the statements of his report in regard to the workings of the system.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Interior has the supervision of so many important\r\nsubjects that his report is of especial value and interest.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th day of June, 1893, there were on the pension rolls 966,012\r\nnames, an increase of 89,944 over the number on the rolls June 30,\r\n1892. Of these there were 17 widows and daughters of Revolutionary\r\nsoldiers, 86 survivors of the War of 1812, 5,425 widows of soldiers of\r\nthat war, 21,518 survivors and widows of the Mexican War, 3,882\r\nsurvivors and widows of Indian wars, 284 army nurses. and 475,645\r\nsurvivors and widows and children of deceased soldiers and sailors of\r\nthe War of the Rebellion. The latter number represents those pensioned\r\non account of disabilities or death resulting from army and navy\r\nservice. The number of persons remaining on the rolls June 30, 1893,\r\nwho were pensioned under the act of June 27, 1890, which allows\r\npensions on account of death and disability not chargeable to army\r\nservice, was 459,155.\r\n\r\nThe number added to the rolls during the year was 123,634 and the\r\nnumber dropped was 33,690. The first payments on pensions allowed\r\nduring the year amounted to $33,756,549.98. This includes arrears, or\r\nthe accumulation between the time from which the allowance of pension\r\ndates and the time of actually granting the certificate.\r\n\r\nAlthough the law of 1890 permits pensions for disabilities not related\r\nto military service, yet as a requisite to its benefits a disability\r\nmust exist incapacitating applicants \"from the performance of manual\r\nlabor to such a degree as to render them unable to earn a support.\" The\r\nexecution of this law in its early stages does not seem to have been in\r\naccord with its true intention, but toward the close of the last\r\nAdministration an authoritative construction was given to the statute,\r\nand since that time this construction has been followed. This has had\r\nthe effect of limiting the operation of the law to its intended\r\npurpose. The discovery having been made that many names had been put\r\nupon the pension roll by means of wholesale and gigantic frauds, the\r\nCommissioner suspended payments upon a number of pensions which seemed\r\nto be fraudulent or unauthorized pending a complete examination, giving\r\nnotice to the pensioners, in order that they might have an opportunity\r\nto establish, if possible, the justice of their claims notwithstanding\r\napparent invalidity.\r\n\r\nThis, I understand, is the practice which has for a long time prevailed\r\nin the Pension Bureau; but after entering upon these recent\r\ninvestigations the Commissioner modified this rule so as not to allow\r\nuntil after a complete examination interference with the payment of a\r\npension apparently not altogether void, but which merely had been fixed\r\nat a rate higher than that authorized by law.\r\n\r\nI am unable to understand why frauds in the pension rolls should not be\r\nexposed and corrected with thoroughness and vigor. Every name\r\nfraudulently put upon these rolls is a wicked imposition upon the\r\nkindly sentiment in which pensions have their origin; every fraudulent\r\npensioner has become a bad citizen; every false oath in support of a\r\npension has made perjury more common, and false and undeserving\r\npensioners rob the people not only of their money, but of the patriotic\r\nsentiment which the survivors of a war fought for the preservation of\r\nthe Union ought to inspire. Thousands of neighborhoods have their\r\nwell-known fraudulent pensioners, and recent developments by the Bureau\r\nestablish appalling conspiracies to accomplish pension frauds. By no\r\nmeans the least wrong done is to brave and deserving pensioners, who\r\ncertainly ought not to be condemned to such association.\r\n\r\nThose who attempt in the line of duty to rectify these wrongs should\r\nnot be accused of enmity or indifference to the claims of honest\r\nveterans. The sum expended on account of pensions for the year ending\r\nJune 30, 1893, was $156,740,467.14.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner estimates that $165,000,000 will be required to pay\r\npensions during the year ending June 30, 1894.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the Indians and their ultimate fate are subjects which\r\nare related to a sacred duty of the Government and which strongly\r\nappeal to the sense of justice and the sympathy of our people.\r\n\r\nOur Indians number about 248,000. Most of them are located on 161\r\nreservations, containing 86,116,531 acres of land. About 110,000 of\r\nthese Indians have to a large degree adopted civilized customs. Lands\r\nin severalty have been allotted to many of them. Such allotments have\r\nbeen made to 10,000 individuals during the last fiscal year, embracing\r\nabout 1,000,000 acres. The number of Indian Government schools opened\r\nduring the year was 195, an increase of 12 over the preceding year. Of\r\nthis total 170 were on reservations, of which 73 were boarding schools\r\nand 97 were day schools. Twenty boarding schools and 5 day schools\r\nsupported by the Government were not located on reservations. The total\r\nnumber of Indian children enrolled during the year as attendants of all\r\nschools was 21,138, an increase of 1,231 over the enrollment for the\r\nprevious year.\r\n\r\nI am sure that secular education and moral and religious teaching must\r\nbe important factors in any effort to save the Indian and lead him to\r\ncivilization. I believe, too, that the relinquishment of tribal\r\nrelations and the holding of land in severalty may in favorable\r\nconditions aid this consummation. It seems to me, however, that\r\nallotments of land in severalty ought to be made with great care and\r\ncircumspection. If hastily done, before the Indian knows its meaning,\r\nwhile yet he has little or no idea of tilling a farm and no conception\r\nof thrift, there is great danger that a reservation life in tribal\r\nrelations may be exchanged for the pauperism of civilization instead of\r\nits independence and elevation.\r\n\r\nThe solution of the Indian problem depends very largely upon good\r\nadministration. The personal fitness of agents and their adaptability\r\nto the peculiar duty of caring for their wards are of the utmost\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nThe law providing that, except in special cases, army officers shall be\r\ndetailed as Indian agents it is hoped will prove a successful\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nThere is danger of great abuses creeping into the prosecution of claims\r\nfor Indian depredations, and I recommend that every possible safeguard\r\nbe provided against the enforcement of unjust and fictitious claims of\r\nthis description.\r\n\r\nThe appropriations on account of the Indian Bureau for the year ending\r\nJune 30, 1894, amount to $7,954,962.99, a decrease as compared with the\r\nyear preceding it of $387,131.95.\r\n\r\nThe vast area of land which but a short time ago constituted the public\r\ndomain is rapidly falling into private hands. It is certain that in the\r\ntransfer the beneficent intention of the Government to supply from its\r\ndomain homes to the industrious and worthy home seekers is often\r\nfrustrated. Though the speculator, who stands with extortionate purpose\r\nbetween the land office and those who, with their families, are invited\r\nby the Government to settle on the public lands, is a despicable\r\ncharacter who ought not to be tolerated, yet it is difficult to thwart\r\nhis schemes. The recent opening to settlement of the lands in the\r\nCherokee Outlet, embracing an area of 6,500,000 acres, notwithstanding\r\nthe utmost care in framing the regulations governing the selection of\r\nlocations and notwithstanding the presence of United States troops,\r\nfurnished an exhibition, though perhaps in a modified degree, of the\r\nmad scramble, the violence, and the fraudulent occupation which have\r\naccompanied previous openings of public land.\r\n\r\nI concur with the Secretary in the belief that these outrageous\r\nincidents can not be entirely prevented without a change in the laws on\r\nthe subject, and I hope his recommendations in that direction will be\r\nfavorably considered.\r\n\r\nI especially commend to the attention of the Congress the statements\r\ncontained in the Secretary's report concerning forestry. The time has\r\ncome when efficient measures should be taken for the preservation of\r\nour forests from indiscriminate and remediless destruction.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of Agriculture will be found exceedingly\r\ninteresting, especially to that large part of our citizens intimately\r\nconcerned in agricultural occupations.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th day of March, 1893, there were upon its pay rolls 2,430\r\nemployees. This number has been reduced to 1,850 persons. In view of a\r\ndepleted public Treasury and the imperative demand of the people for\r\neconomy in the administration of their Government, the Secretary has\r\nentered upon the task of rationally reducing expenditures by the\r\nelimination from the pay rolls of all persons not needed for an\r\nefficient conduct of the affairs of the Department.\r\n\r\nDuring the first quarter of the present year the expenses of the\r\nDepartment aggregated $345,876.76, as against $402,012.42 for the\r\ncorresponding period of the fiscal year ending June 30, 1893. The\r\nSecretary makes apparent his intention to continue this rate of\r\nreduction by submitting estimates for the next fiscal year less by\r\n$994,280 than those for the present year.\r\n\r\nAmong the heads of divisions in this Department the changes have been\r\nexceedingly few. Three vacancies occurring from death and resignations\r\nhave been filled by the promotion of assistants in the same divisions.\r\n\r\nThese promotions of experienced and faithful assistants have not only\r\nbeen in the interest of efficient work, but have suggested to those in\r\nthe Department who look for retention and promotion that merit and\r\ndevotion to duty are their best reliance.\r\n\r\nThe amount appropriated for the Bureau of Animal Industry for the\r\ncurrent fiscal year is $850,000. The estimate for the ensuing year is\r\n$700,000.\r\n\r\nThe regulations of 1892 concerning Texas fever have been enforced\r\nduring the last year and the large stock yards of the country have been\r\nkept free from infection. Occasional local outbreaks have been largely\r\nsuch as could have been effectually guarded against by the owners of\r\nthe affected cattle.\r\n\r\nWhile contagious pleuro-pneumonia in cattle has been eradicated, animal\r\ntuberculosis, a disease widespread and more dangerous to human life\r\nthan pleuro-pneumonia, is still prevalent. Investigations have been\r\nmade during the past year as to the means of its communication and the\r\nmethod of its correct diagnosis. Much progress has been made in this\r\ndirection by the studies of the division of animal pathology, but work\r\nought to be extended, in cooperation with local authorities, until the\r\ndanger to human life arising from this cause is reduced to a minimum.\r\n\r\nThe number of animals arriving from Canada during the year and\r\ninspected by Bureau officers was 462,092, and the number from\r\ntransatlantic countries was 1,297. No contagious diseases were found\r\namong the imported animals.\r\n\r\nThe total number of inspections of cattle for export during the past\r\nfiscal year was 611,542. The exports show a falling off of about 25 per\r\ncent from the preceding year, the decrease occurring entirely in the\r\nlast half of the year. This suggests that the falling off may have been\r\nlargely due to an increase in the price of American export cattle.\r\n\r\nDuring the year ending June 30, 1893, exports of inspected pork\r\naggregated 10,677,410 pounds, as against 38,152,874 pounds for the\r\npreceding year. The falling off in this export was not confined,\r\nhowever, to inspected pork, the total quantity exported for 1892 being\r\n665,490,616 pounds, while in 1893 it was only 527,308,695 pounds.\r\n\r\nI join the Secretary in recommending that hereafter each applicant for\r\nthe position of inspector or assistant inspector in the Bureau of\r\nAnimal Industry be required, as a condition precedent to his\r\nappointment, to exhibit to the United States Civil Service Commission\r\nhis diploma from an established, regular, and reputable veterinary\r\ncollege, and that this be supplemented by such an examination in\r\nveterinary science as the Commission may prescribe.\r\n\r\nThe exports of agricultural products from the United States for the\r\nfiscal year ending June 30, 1892, attained the enormous figure of\r\n$800,000,000, in round numbers, being 78.7 per cent of our total\r\nexports. In the last fiscal year this aggregate was greatly reduced,\r\nbut nevertheless reached 615,000,000, being 75.1 per cent of all\r\nAmerican commodities exported.\r\n\r\nA review of our agricultural exports with special reference to their\r\ndestination will show that in almost every line the United Kingdom of\r\nGreat Britain and Ireland absorbs by far the largest proportion. Of\r\ncattle the total exports aggregated in value for the fiscal year ending\r\nJune 30, 1893, $26,000,000, of which Great Britain took considerably\r\nover $25,000,000. Of beef products of all kinds our total exports were\r\n$28,000,000, of which Great Britain took $24,000,000. Of pork products\r\nthe total exports were $84,000,000, of which Great Britain took\r\n$53,000,000. In breadstuffs, cotton, and minor products like\r\nproportions sent to the same destination are shown.\r\n\r\nThe work of the statistical division of the Department of Agriculture\r\ndeals with all that relates to the economics of farming.\r\n\r\nThe main purpose of its monthly reports is to keep the farmers informed\r\nas fully as possible of all matters having any influence upon the\r\nworld's markets, in which their products find sale. Its publications\r\nrelate especially to the commercial side of farming.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore of profound importance and vital concern to the farmers\r\nof the United States, who represent nearly one-half of our population,\r\nand also of direct interest to the whole country, that the work of this\r\ndivision be efficiently performed and that the information it has\r\ngathered be promptly diffused.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter for congratulation to know that the Secretary will not\r\nspare any effort to make this part of his work thoroughly useful.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1839 the Congress appropriated $1,000, to be taken from the\r\nPatent Office funds, for the purpose of collecting and distributing\r\nrare and improved varieties of seeds and for prosecuting agricultural\r\ninvestigations and procuring agricultural statistics. From this small\r\nbeginning the seed division of the Department of Agriculture has grown\r\nto its present unwieldy and unjustifiably extravagant proportions.\r\n\r\nDuring the last fiscal year the cost of seeds purchased was $66,548.61.\r\nThe remainder of an appropriation of $135,000 was expended in putting\r\nthem up and distributing them. It surely never could have entered the\r\nminds of those who first sanctioned appropriations of public money for\r\nthe purchase of new and improved varieties of seeds for gratuitous\r\ndistribution that from this would grow large appropriations for the\r\npurchase and distribution by members of Congress of ordinary seeds,\r\nbulbs, and cuttings which are common in all the States and Territories\r\nand everywhere easily obtainable at low prices.\r\n\r\nIn each State and Territory an agricultural experiment station has been\r\nestablished. These stations, by their very character and name, are the\r\nproper agencies to experiment with and test new varieties of seeds; and\r\nyet this indiscriminate and wasteful distribution by legislation and\r\nlegislators continues, answering no purpose unless it be to remind\r\nconstituents that their representatives are willing to remember them\r\nwith gratuities at public cost.\r\n\r\nUnder the sanction of existing legislation there was sent out from the\r\nAgricultural Department during the last fiscal year enough of cabbage\r\nseed to plant 19,200 acres of land, a sufficient quantity of beans to\r\nplant 4,000 acres, beet seed enough to plant 2,500 acres, sweet corn\r\nenough to plant 7,800 acres, sufficient cucumber seed to cover 2,025\r\nacres with vines, and enough muskmelon and watermelon seeds to plant\r\n2,675 acres. The total quantity of flower and vegetable seeds thus\r\ndistributed was contained in more than 9,000,000 packages, and they\r\nwere sufficient if planted to cover 89,596 acres of land.\r\n\r\nIn view of these facts this enormous expenditure without legitimate\r\nreturns of benefit ought to be abolished. Anticipating a consummation\r\nso manifestly in the interest of good administration, more than\r\n$100,000 has been stricken from the estimate made to cover this object\r\nfor the year ending June 30, 1895; and the Secretary recommends that\r\nthe remaining $35,000 of the estimate be confined strictly to the\r\npurchase of new and improved varieties of seeds, and that these be\r\ndistributed through experiment stations.\r\n\r\nThus the seed will be tested, and after the test has been completed by\r\nthe experiment station the propagation of the useful varieties and the\r\nrejection of the valueless may safely be left to the common sense of\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nThe continued intelligent execution of the civil-service law and the\r\nincreasing approval by the people of its operation are most gratifying.\r\nThe recent extension of its limitations and regulations to the\r\nemployees at free-delivery post-offices, which has been honestly and\r\npromptly accomplished by the Commission, with the hearty cooperation of\r\nthe Postmaster-General, is an immensely important advance in the\r\nusefulness of the system.\r\n\r\nI am, if possible, more than ever convinced of the incalculable\r\nbenefits conferred by the civil-service law, not only in its effect\r\nupon the public service, but also, what is even more important, in its\r\neffect in elevating the tone of political life generally.\r\n\r\nThe course of civil-service reform in this country instructively and\r\ninterestingly illustrates how strong a hold a movement gains upon our\r\npeople which has underlying it a sentiment of justice and right and\r\nwhich at the same time promises better administration of their\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThe law embodying this reform found its way to our statute book more\r\nfrom fear of the popular sentiment existing in its favor than from any\r\nlove for the reform itself on the part of legislators, and it has lived\r\nand grown and flourished in spite of the covert as well as open\r\nhostility of spoilsmen and notwithstanding the querulous\r\nimpracticability of many self-constituted guardians. Beneath all the\r\nvagaries and sublimated theories which are attracted to it there\r\nunderlies this reform a sturdy common-sense principle not only suited\r\nto this mundane sphere, but whose application our people are more and\r\nmore recognizing to be absolutely essential to the most successful\r\noperation of their Government, if not to its perpetuity.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me to be entirely inconsistent with the character of this\r\nreform, as well as with its best enforcement, to oblige the Commission\r\nto rely for clerical assistance upon clerks detailed from other\r\nDepartments. There ought not to be such a condition in any Department\r\nthat clerks hired to do work there can be spared to habitually work at\r\nanother place, and it does not accord with a sensible view of\r\ncivil-service reform that persons should be employed on the theory that\r\ntheir labor is necessary in one Department when in point of fact their\r\nservices are devoted to entirely different work in another Department.\r\n\r\nI earnestly urge that the clerks necessary to carry on the work of the\r\nCommission be regularly put upon its roster and that the system of\r\nobliging the Commissioners to rely upon the services of clerks\r\nbelonging to other Departments be discontinued. This ought not to\r\nincrease the expense to the Government, while it would certainly be\r\nmore consistent and add greatly to the efficiency of the Commission.\r\n\r\nEconomy in public expenditure is a duty that can not innocently be\r\nneglected by those intrusted with the control of money drawn from the\r\npeople for public uses. It must be confessed that our apparently\r\nendless resources, the familiarity of our people with immense\r\naccumulations of wealth, the growing sentiment among them that the\r\nexpenditure of public money should in some manner be to their immediate\r\nand personal advantage, the indirect and almost stealthy manner in\r\nwhich a large part of our taxes is exacted, and a degenerated sense of\r\nofficial accountability have led to growing extravagance in\r\ngovernmental appropriations.\r\n\r\nAt this time, when a depleted public Treasury confronts us, when many\r\nof our people are engaged in a hard struggle for the necessaries of\r\nlife, and when enforced economy is pressing upon the great mass of our\r\ncountrymen, I desire to urge with all the earnestness at my command\r\nthat Congressional legislation be so limited by strict economy as to\r\nexhibit an appreciation of the condition of the Treasury and a sympathy\r\nwith the straitened circumstances of our fellow-citizens.\r\n\r\nThe duty of public economy is also of immense importance in its\r\nintimate and necessary relation to the task now in hand of providing\r\nrevenue to meet Government expenditures and yet reducing the people's\r\nburden of Federal taxation.\r\n\r\nAfter a hard struggle tariff reform is directly before us. Nothing so\r\nimportant claims our attention and nothing so clearly presents itself\r\nas both an opportunity and a duty--an opportunity to deserve the\r\ngratitude of our fellow-citizens and a duty imposed upon us by our\r\noft-repeated professions and by the emphatic mandate of the people.\r\nAfter full discussion our countrymen have spoken in favor of this\r\nreform, and they have confided the work of its accomplishment to the\r\nhands of those who are solemnly pledged to it.\r\n\r\nIf there is anything in the theory of a representation in public places\r\nof the people and their desires, if public officers are really the\r\nservants of the people, and if political promises and professions have\r\nany binding force, our failure to give the relief so long awaited will\r\nbe sheer recreancy. Nothing should intervene to distract our attention\r\nor disturb our effort until this reform is accomplished by wise and\r\ncareful legislation.\r\n\r\nWhile we should stanchly adhere to the principle that only the\r\nnecessity of revenue justifies the imposition of tariff duties and\r\nother Federal taxation and that they should be limited by strict\r\neconomy, we can not close our eyes to the fact that conditions have\r\ngrown up among us which in justice and fairness call for discriminating\r\ncare in the distribution of such duties and taxation as the emergencies\r\nof our Government actually demand.\r\n\r\nManifestly if we are to aid the people directly through tariff reform,\r\none of its most obvious features should be a reduction in present\r\ntariff charges upon the necessaries of life. The benefits of such a\r\nreduction would be palpable and substantial, seen and felt by thousands\r\nwho would be better fed and better clothed and better sheltered. These\r\ngifts should be the willing benefactions of a Government whose highest\r\nfunction is the promotion of the welfare of the people.\r\n\r\nNot less closely related to our people's prosperity and well-being is\r\nthe removal of restrictions upon the importation of the raw materials\r\nnecessary to our manufactures. The world should be open to our national\r\ningenuity and enterprise. This can not be while Federal legislation\r\nthrough the imposition of high tariff forbids to American manufacturers\r\nas cheap materials as those used by their competitors. It is quite\r\nobvious that the .enhancement of the price of our manufactured products\r\nresulting from this policy not only confines the market for these\r\nproducts within our own borders, to the direct disadvantage of our\r\nmanufacturers, but also increases their cost to our citizens.\r\n\r\nThe interests of labor are certainly, though indirectly, involved in\r\nthis feature of our tariff system. The sharp competition and active\r\nstruggle among our manufacturers to supply the limited demand for their\r\ngoods soon fill the narrow market to which they are confined. Then\r\nfollows a suspension of work in mills and factories, a discharge of\r\nemployees, and distress in the homes of our workingmen.\r\n\r\nEven if the often-disproved assertion could be made good that a lower\r\nrate of wages would result from free raw materials and low tariff\r\nduties, the intelligence of our workmen leads them quickly to discover\r\nthat their steady employment, permitted by free raw materials, is the\r\nmost important factor in their relation to tariff legislation.\r\n\r\nA measure has been prepared by the appropriate Congressional committee\r\nembodying tariff reform on the lines herein suggested, which will be\r\npromptly submitted for legislative action. It is the result of much\r\npatriotic and unselfish work, and I believe it deals with its subject\r\nconsistently and as thoroughly as existing conditions permit.\r\n\r\nI am satisfied that the reduced tariff duties provided for in the\r\nproposed legislation, added to existing internal-revenue taxation, will\r\nin the near future, though perhaps not immediately, produce sufficient\r\nrevenue to meet the needs of the Government.\r\n\r\nThe committee, after full consideration and to provide against a\r\ntemporary deficiency which may exist before the business of the country\r\nadjusts itself to the new tariff schedules, have wisely embraced in\r\ntheir plan a few additional internal-revenue taxes, including a small\r\ntax upon incomes derived from certain corporate investments.\r\n\r\nThese new adjustments are not only absolutely just and easily borne,\r\nbut they have the further merit of being such as can be remitted\r\nwithout unfavorable business disturbance whenever the necessity of\r\ntheir imposition no longer exists.\r\n\r\nIn my great desire for the success of this measure I can not restrain\r\nthe suggestion that its success can only be attained by means of\r\nunselfish counsel on the part of the friends of tariff reform and as a\r\nresult of their willingness to subordinate personal desires and\r\nambitions to the general good. The local interests affected by the\r\nproposed reform are so numerous and so varied that if all are insisted\r\nupon the legislation embodying the reform must inevitably fail.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion my intense feeling of responsibility impels me to invoke\r\nfor the manifold interests of a generous and confiding people the most\r\nscrupulous care and to pledge my willing support to every legislative\r\neffort for the advancement of the greatness and prosperity of our\r\nbeloved country.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nGrover Cleveland\r\nDecember 3, 1894\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the Congress of the United States:\r\n\r\nThe assemblage within the nation's legislative halls of those charged\r\nwith the duty of making laws for the benefit of a generous and free\r\npeople impressively suggests the exacting obligation and inexorable\r\nresponsibility involved in their task. At the threshold of such labor\r\nnow to be undertaken by the Congress of the United States, and in the\r\ndischarge of an executive duty enjoined by the Constitution, I submit\r\nthis communication, containing a brief statement of the condition of\r\nour national affairs and recommending such legislation as seems to me\r\nnecessary and expedient.\r\n\r\nThe history of our recent dealings with other nations and our peaceful\r\nrelations with them at this time additionally demonstrate the advantage\r\nof consistently adhering to a firm but just foreign policy, free from\r\nenvious or ambitious national schemes and characterized by entire\r\nhonesty and sincerity.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year, pursuant to a law of Congress, commissioners were\r\nappointed to the Antwerp Industrial Exposition. Though the\r\nparticipation of American exhibitors fell far short of completely\r\nillustrating our national ingenuity and industrial achievements, yet it\r\nwas quite creditable in view of the brief time allowed for preparation.\r\n\r\nI have endeavored to impress upon the Belgian Government the\r\nheedlessness and positive harmfulness of its restrictions upon the\r\nimportation of certain of our food products, and have strongly urged\r\nthat the rigid supervision and inspection under our laws are amply\r\nsufficient to prevent the exportation from this country of diseased\r\ncattle and unwholesome meat.\r\n\r\nThe termination of the civil war in Brazil has been followed by the\r\ngeneral prevalence of peace and order. It appearing at an early stage\r\nof the insurrection that its course would call for unusual watchfulness\r\non the part of this Government, our naval force in the harbor of Rio de\r\nJaneiro was strengthened. This precaution, I am satisfied, tended to\r\nrestrict the issue to a simple trial of strength between the Brazilian\r\nGovernment and the insurgents and to avert complications which at times\r\nseemed imminent. Our firm attitude of neutrality was maintained to the\r\nend. The insurgents received no encouragement of eventual asylum from\r\nour commanders, and such opposition as they encountered was for the\r\nprotection of our commerce and was clearly justified by public law.\r\n\r\nA serious tension of relations having arisen at the close of the war\r\nbetween Brazil and Portugal by reason of the escape of the insurgent\r\nadmiral Da Gama and his followers, the friendly offices of our\r\nrepresentatives to those countries were exerted for the protection of\r\nthe subjects of either within the territory of the other.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Government of Brazil was duly notified that the commercial\r\narrangement existing between the United States and that country based\r\non the third section of the tariff act of 1890 was abrogated on August\r\n28, 1894, by the taking effect of the tariff law now in force, that\r\nGovernment subsequently notified us of its intention to terminate such\r\narrangement on the 1st day of January, 1895, in the exercise of the\r\nright reserved in the agreement between the two countries. I invite\r\nattention to the correspondence between the Secretary of State and the\r\nBrazilian minister on this subject.\r\n\r\nThe commission organized under the convention which we had entered into\r\nwith Chile for the settlement of the outstanding claims of each\r\nGovernment against the other adjourned at the end of the period\r\nstipulated for its continuance leaving undetermined a number of\r\nAmerican cases which had been duly presented. These claims are not\r\nbarred, and negotiations are in progress for their submission to a new\r\ntribunal.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of March last a new treaty with China in further regulation\r\nof emigration was signed at Washington, and on August 13 it received\r\nthe sanction of the Senate. Ratification on the part of China and\r\nformal exchange are awaited to give effect to this mutually beneficial\r\nconvention.\r\n\r\nA gratifying recognition of the uniform impartiality of this country\r\ntoward all foreign states was manifested by the coincident request of\r\nthe Chinese and Japanese Governments that the agents of the United\r\nStates should within proper limits afford protection to the subjects of\r\nthe other during the suspension of diplomatic relations due to a state\r\nof war. This delicate office was accepted, and a misapprehension which\r\ngave rise to the belief that in affording this kindly unofficial\r\nprotection our agents would exercise the same authority which the\r\nwithdrawn agents of the belligerents had exercised was promptly\r\ncorrected. Although the war between China and Japan endangers no policy\r\nof the United States, it deserves our gravest consideration by reason\r\nof its disturbance of our growing commercial interests in the two\r\ncountries and the increased dangers which may result to our citizens\r\ndomiciled or sojourning in the interior of China.\r\n\r\nActing under a stipulation in our treaty with Korea (the first\r\nconcluded with a western power), I felt constrained at the beginning of\r\nthe controversy to tender our good offices to induce an amicable\r\narrangement of the initial difficulty growing out of the Japanese\r\ndemands for administrative reforms in Korea, but the unhappy\r\nprecipitation of actual hostilities defeated this kindly purpose.\r\n\r\nDeploring the destructive war between the two most powerful of the\r\neastern nations and anxious that our commercial interests in those\r\ncountries may be preserved and that the safety of our citizens there\r\nshall not be jeopardized, I would not hesitate to heed any intimation\r\nthat our friendly aid for the honorable termination of hostilities\r\nwould be acceptable to both belligerents.\r\n\r\nA convention has been finally concluded for the settlement by\r\narbitration of the prolonged dispute with Ecuador growing out of the\r\nproceedings against Emilio Santos, a naturalized citizen of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nOur relations with the Republic of France continue to be such as should\r\nexist between nations so long bound together by friendly sympathy and\r\nsimilarity in their form of government.\r\n\r\nThe recent cruel assassination of the President of this sister Republic\r\ncalled forth such universal expressions of sorrow and condolence from\r\nour people and Government as to leave no doubt of the depth and\r\nsincerity of our attachment. The resolutions passed by the Senate and\r\nHouse of Representatives on the occasion have been communicated to the\r\nwidow of President Carnot.\r\n\r\nActing upon the reported discovery of Texas fever in cargoes of\r\nAmerican cattle, the German prohibition against importations of live\r\nstock and fresh meats from this country has been revived. It is hoped\r\nthat Germany will soon become convinced that the inhibition is as\r\nneedless as it is harmful to mutual interests.\r\n\r\nThe German Government has protested against that provision of the\r\ncustoms tariff act which imposes a discriminating duty of one-tenth of\r\n1 cent a pound on sugars coming from countries paying an export bounty\r\nthereon, claiming that the exaction of such duty is in contravention of\r\nArticles V and IX of the treaty of 1828 with Prussia.\r\n\r\nIn the interests of the commerce of both countries and to avoid even\r\nthe accusation of treaty violation, I recommend the repeal of so much\r\nof the statute as imposes that duty, and I invite attention to the\r\naccompanying report of the Secretary of State, containing a discussion\r\nof the questions raised by the German protests.\r\n\r\nEarly in the present year an agreement was reached with Great Britain\r\nconcerning instructions to be given to the naval commanders of the two\r\nGovernments in Bering Sea and the contiguous North Pacific Ocean for\r\ntheir guidance in the execution of the award of the Paris Tribunal of\r\nArbitration and the enforcement of the regulations therein prescribed\r\nfor the protection of seal life in the waters mentioned. An\r\nunderstanding has also been reached for the payment by the United\r\nStates of\r\n\r\n$425,000 in full satisfaction of all claims which may be made by Great\r\nBritain for damages growing out of the controversy as to fur seals in\r\nBering Sea or the seizure of British vessels engaged in taking seal in\r\nthose waters. The award and findings of the Paris Tribunal to a great\r\nextent determined the facts and principles upon which these claims\r\nshould be adjusted, and they have been subjected by both Governments to\r\na thorough examination upon the principles as well as the facts which\r\nthey involve. I am convinced that a settlement upon the terms mentioned\r\nwould be an equitable and advantageous one, and I recommend that\r\nprovision be made for the prompt payment of the stated sum.\r\n\r\nThus far only France and Portugal have signified their willingness to\r\nadhere to the regulations established under the award of the Paris\r\nTribunal of Arbitration.\r\n\r\nPreliminary surveys of the Alaskan boundary and a preparatory\r\nexamination of the question of protection of food fish in the\r\ncontiguous waters of the United States and the Dominion of Canada are\r\nin progress.\r\n\r\nThe boundary of British Guiana still remains in dispute between Great\r\nBritain and Venezuela. Believing that its early settlement on some just\r\nbasis alike honorable to both parties is in the line of our established\r\npolicy to remove from this hemisphere all causes of difference with\r\npowers beyond the sea, I shall renew the efforts heretofore made to\r\nbring about a restoration of diplomatic relations between the\r\ndisputants and to induce a reference to arbitration--a resort which\r\nGreat Britain so conspicuously favors in principle and respects in\r\npractice and which is earnestly sought by her weaker adversary.\r\n\r\nSince communicating the voluminous correspondence in regard to Hawaii\r\nand the action taken by the Senate and House of Representatives on\r\ncertain questions submitted to the judgment and wider discretion of\r\nCongress the organization of a government in place of the provisional\r\narrangement which followed the deposition of the Queen has been\r\nannounced, with evidence of its effective operation. The recognition\r\nusual in such cases has been accorded the new Government.\r\n\r\nUnder our present treaties of extradition with Italy miscarriages of\r\njustice have occurred owing to the refusal of that Government to\r\nsurrender its own subjects. Thus far our efforts to negotiate an\r\namended convention obviating this difficulty have been unavailing.\r\n\r\nApart from the war in which the Island Empire is engaged, Japan\r\nattracts increasing attention in this country by her evident desire to\r\ncultivate more liberal intercourse with us and to seek our kindly aid\r\nin furtherance of her laudable desire for complete autonomy in her\r\ndomestic affairs and full equality in the family of nations. The\r\nJapanese Empire of to-day is no longer the Japan of the past, and our\r\nrelations with this progressive nation should not be less broad and\r\nliberal than those with other powers.\r\n\r\nGood will, fostered by many interests in common, has marked our\r\nrelations with our nearest southern neighbor. Peace being restored\r\nalong her northern frontier, Mexico has asked the punishment of the\r\nlate disturbers of her tranquillity. There ought to be a new treaty of\r\ncommerce and navigation with that country to take the place of the one\r\nwhich terminated thirteen years ago. The friendliness of the\r\nintercourse between the two countries is attested by the fact that\r\nduring this long period the commerce of each has steadily increased\r\nunder the rule of mutual consideration, being neither stimulated by\r\nconventional arrangements nor retarded by jealous rivalries or selfish\r\ndistrust.\r\n\r\nAn indemnity tendered by Mexico as a gracious act for the murder in\r\n1887 of Leon Baldwin, an American citizen, by a band of marauders in\r\nDurango has been accepted and is being paid in installments.\r\n\r\nThe problem of the storage and use of the waters of the Rio Grande for\r\nirrigation should be solved by appropriate concurrent action of the two\r\ninterested countries. Rising in the Colorado heights, the stream flows\r\nintermittently, yielding little water during the dry months to the\r\nirrigation channels already constructed along its course. This scarcity\r\nis often severely felt in the regions where the river forms a common\r\nboundary. Moreover, the frequent changes in its course through level\r\nsands often raise embarrassing questions of territorial jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nProminent among the questions of the year was the Bluefields incident,\r\nin what is known as the Mosquito Indian Strip, bordering on the\r\nAtlantic Ocean and within the jurisdiction of Nicaragua. By the treaty\r\nof 1860 between Great Britain and Nicaragua the former Government\r\nexpressly recognized the sovereignty of the latter over the strip, and\r\na limited form of self-government was guaranteed to the Mosquito\r\nIndians, to be exercised according to their customs, for themselves and\r\nother dwellers within its limits. The so-called native government,\r\nwhich grew to be largely made up of aliens, for many years disputed the\r\nsovereignty of Nicaragua over the strip and claimed the right to\r\nmaintain therein a practically independent municipal government. Early\r\nin the past year efforts of Nicaragua to maintain sovereignty over the\r\nMosquito territory led to serious disturbances, culminating in the\r\nsuppression of the native government and the attempted substitution of\r\nan impracticable composite administration in which Nicaragua and alien\r\nresidents were to participate. Failure was followed by an insurrection,\r\nwhich for a time subverted Nicaraguan rule, expelling her officers and\r\nrestoring the old organization. This in turn gave place to the existing\r\nlocal government established and upheld by Nicaragua.\r\n\r\nAlthough the alien interests arrayed against Nicaragua in these\r\ntransactions have been largely American and the commerce of that region\r\nfor some time has been and still is chiefly controlled by our citizens,\r\nwe can not for that reason challenge the rightful sovereignty of\r\nNicaragua over this important part of her domain.\r\n\r\nFor some months one, and during part of the time two, of our naval\r\nships have been stationed at Bluefields for the protection of all\r\nlegitimate interests of our citizens. In September last the Government\r\nat Managua expelled from its territory twelve or more foreigners,\r\nincluding two Americans, for alleged participation in the seditious or\r\nrevolutionary movements against the Republic at Bluefields already\r\nmentioned; but through the earnest remonstrance of this Government the\r\ntwo Americans have been permitted to return to the peaceful management\r\nof their business. Our naval commanders at the scene of these\r\ndisturbances by their constant exhibition of firmness and good judgment\r\ncontributed largely to the prevention of more serious consequences and\r\nto the restoration of quiet and order. I regret that in the midst of\r\nthese occurrences there happened a most grave and irritating failure of\r\nNicaraguan justice. An American citizen named Wilson, residing at Rama,\r\nin the Mosquito territory, was murdered by one Arguello, the acting\r\ngovernor of the town. After some delay the murderer was arrested, but\r\nso insecurely confined or guarded that he escaped, and notwithstanding\r\nour repeated demands it is claimed that his recapture has been\r\nimpossible by reason of his flight beyond Nicaraguan jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nThe Nicaraguan authorities, having given notice of forfeiture of their\r\nconcession to the canal company on grounds purely technical and not\r\nembraced in the contract, have receded from that position.\r\n\r\nPeru, I regret to say, shows symptoms of domestic disturbance, due\r\nprobably to the slowness of her recuperation from the distresses of the\r\nwar of 1881. Weakened in resources, her difficulties in facing\r\ninternational obligations invite our kindly sympathy and justify our\r\nforbearance in pressing long-pending claims. I have felt constrained to\r\ntestify this sympathy in connection with certain demands urgently\r\npreferred by other powers.\r\n\r\nThe recent death of the Czar of Russia called forth appropriate\r\nexpressions of sorrow and sympathy on the part of our Government with\r\nhis bereaved family and the Russian people. As a further demonstration\r\nof respect and friendship our minister at St. Petersburg was directed\r\nto represent our Government at the funeral ceremonies.\r\n\r\nThe sealing interests of Russia in Bering Sea are second only to our\r\nown. A modus vivendi has therefore been concluded with the Imperial\r\nGovernment restrictive of poaching on the Russian rookeries and of\r\nsealing in waters which were not comprehended in the protected area\r\ndefined in the Paris award.\r\n\r\nOccasion has been found to urge upon the Russian Government equality of\r\ntreatment for our great life-insurance companies whose operations have\r\nbeen extended throughout Europe. Admitting as we do foreign\r\ncorporations to transact business in the United States, we naturally\r\nexpect no less tolerance for our own in the ample fields of competition\r\nabroad.\r\n\r\nBut few cases of interference with naturalized citizens returning to\r\nRussia have been reported during the current year. One Krzeminski was\r\narrested last summer in a Polish province on a reported charge of\r\nunpermitted renunciation of Russian allegiance, but it transpired that\r\nthe proceedings originated in alleged malfeasance committed by\r\nKrzeminski while an imperial official a number of years ago. Efforts\r\nfor his release, which promised to be successful, were in progress when\r\nhis death was reported.\r\n\r\nThe Government of Salvador having been overthrown by an abrupt popular\r\noutbreak, certain of its military and civil officers, while hotly\r\npursued by infuriated insurgents, sought refuge on board the United\r\nStates war ship Bennington, then lying in a Salvadorean port. Although\r\nthe practice of asylum is not favored by this Government, yet in view\r\nof the imminent peril which threatened the fugitives and solely from\r\nconsiderations of humanity they were afforded shelter by our naval\r\ncommander, and when afterwards demanded under our treaty of extradition\r\nwith Salvador for trial on charges of murder, arson, and robbery I\r\ndirected that such of them as had not voluntarily left the ship be\r\nconveyed to one of our nearest ports where a hearing could be had\r\nbefore a judicial officer, in compliance with the terms of the treaty.\r\nOn their arrival at San Francisco such a proceeding was promptly\r\ninstituted before the United States district judge, who held that the\r\nacts constituting the alleged offenses were political and discharged\r\nall the accused except one Cienfuegos, who was held for an attempt to\r\nmurder. Thereupon I was constrained to direct his release for the\r\nreason that an attempt to murder was not one of the crimes charged\r\nagainst him and upon which his surrender to the Salvadorean authorities\r\nhad been demanded.\r\n\r\nUnreasonable and unjust fines imposed by Spain on the vessels and\r\ncommerce of the United States have demanded from time to time during\r\nthe last twenty years earnest remonstrance on the part of our\r\nGovernment. In the immediate past exorbitant penalties have been\r\nimposed upon our vessels and goods by customs authorities of Cuba and\r\nPuerto Rico for clerical errors of the most trivial character in the\r\nmanifests of bills of lading. In some cases fines amounting to\r\nthousands of dollars have been levied upon cargoes or the carrying\r\nvessels when the goods in question were entitled to free entry. Fines\r\nhave been exacted even when the error had been detected and the Spanish\r\nauthorities notified before the arrival of the goods in port.\r\n\r\nThis conduct is in strange contrast with the considerate and liberal\r\ntreatment extended to Spanish vessels and cargoes in our ports in like\r\ncases. No satisfactory settlement of these vexatious questions has yet\r\nbeen reached.\r\n\r\nThe Mora case, referred to in my last annual message, remains\r\nunsettled. From the diplomatic correspondence on this subject which has\r\nbeen laid before the Senate it will be seen that this Government has\r\noffered to conclude a convention with Spain for disposal by arbitration\r\nof outstanding claims between the two countries, except the Mora claim.\r\nwhich, having been long ago adjusted, now only awaits payment as\r\nstipulated, and of course it could not be included in the proposed\r\nconvention. It was hoped that this offer would remove parliamentary\r\nobstacles encountered by the Spanish Government in providing payment of\r\nthe Mora indemnity. I regret to say that no definite reply to this\r\noffer has yet been made and all efforts to secure payment of this\r\nsettled claim have been unavailing.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message I adverted to the claim on the part of Turkey\r\nof the right to expel as persons undesirable and dangerous Armenians\r\nnaturalized in the United States and returning to Turkish jurisdiction.\r\nNumerous questions in this relation have arisen. While this Government\r\nacquiesces in the asserted right of expulsion, it will not consent that\r\nArmenians may be imprisoned or otherwise punished for no other reason\r\nthan having acquired without imperial consent American citizenship.\r\n\r\nThree of the assailants of Miss Melton, an American teacher in Mosul,\r\nhave been convicted by the Ottoman courts, and I am advised that an\r\nappeal against the acquittal of the remaining five has been taken by\r\nthe Turkish prosecuting officer.\r\n\r\nA convention has been concluded with Venezuela for the arbitration of a\r\nlong-disputed claim growing out of the seizure of certain vessels the\r\nproperty of citizens of the United States. Although signed, the treaty\r\nof extradition with Venezuela is not yet in force, owing to the\r\ninsistence of that Government that when surrendered its citizens shall\r\nin no case be liable to capital punishment.\r\n\r\nThe rules for the prevention of collisions at sea which were framed by\r\nthe maritime conference held in this city in 1889, having been\r\nconcurrently incorporated in the statutes of the United States and\r\nGreat Britain have been announced to take effect March 1, 1895, and\r\ninvitations have been extended to all maritime nations to adhere to\r\nthem. Favorable responses have thus far been received from Austria,\r\nFrance, Portugal, Spain, and Sweden.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message I referred briefly to the unsatisfactory\r\nstate of affairs in Samoa under the operation of the Berlin treaty as\r\nsignally illustrating the impolicy of entangling alliances with foreign\r\npowers, and on May 9, 1894, in response to a resolution of the Senate,\r\nI sent a Special message and documents to that body on the same\r\nsubject, which emphasized my previously expressed opinions. Later\r\noccurrences, the correspondence in regard to which will be laid before\r\nthe Congress, further demonstrate that the Government which was devised\r\nby the three powers and forced upon the Samoans against their\r\ninveterate hostility can be maintained only by the continued presence\r\nof foreign military force and at no small sacrifice of life and\r\ntreasure.\r\n\r\nThe suppression of the Mataafa insurrection by the powers and the\r\nsubsequent banishment of the leader and eleven other chiefs, as recited\r\nin my last message, did not bring lasting peace to the islands.\r\nFormidable uprisings continued, and finally a rebellion broke out in\r\nthe capital island, Upolu, headed in Aana, the western district, by the\r\nyounger Tamasese, and in Atua, the eastern district, by other leaders.\r\nThe insurgents ravaged the country and fought the Government's troops\r\nup to the very doors of Apia. The King again appealed to the powers for\r\nhelp, and the combined British and German naval forces reduced the\r\nAtuans to apparent subjection, not, however, without considerable loss\r\nto the natives. A few days later Tamasese and his adherents, fearing\r\nthe ships and the marines, professed submission.\r\n\r\nReports received from our agents at Apia do not justify the belief that\r\nthe peace thus brought about will be of long duration. It is their\r\nconviction that the natives are at heart hostile to the present\r\nGovernment, that such of them as profess loyalty to it do so from fear\r\nof the powers, and that it would speedily go to pieces if the war ships\r\nwere withdrawn. In reporting to his Government on the unsatisfactory\r\nsituation since the suppression of the late revolt by foreign armed\r\nforces, the German consul at Apia stated:\r\n\r\nThat peace will be lasting is hardly to be presumed. The lesson given\r\nby firing on Atua was not sufficiently sharp and incisive to leave a\r\nlasting impression on the forgetful Samoan temperament. In fact,\r\nconditions are existing which show that peace will not last and is not\r\nseriously intended. Malietoa, the King, and his chiefs are convinced\r\nthat the departure of the war ships will be a signal for a renewal of\r\nwar. The circumstance that the representatives of the villages of all\r\nthe districts which were opposed to the Government have already\r\nwithdrawn to Atua to hold meetings, and that both Atua and Aana have\r\nforbidden inhabitants of those districts which fought on the side of\r\nthe Government to return to their villages, and have already partly\r\nburned down the latter, indicates that a real conciliation of the\r\nparties is still far off.\r\n And in a note of the 10th ultimo, inclosing a copy of that report for the information of this Government, the German ambassador said:\r\nThe contents of the report awakened the imperial Government's\r\napprehension that under existing circumstances the peace concluded with\r\nthe rebels will afford no assurance of the lasting restoration of\r\ntranquillity in the islands.\r\n The present Government has utterly failed to correct, if indeed it has not aggravated, the very evils it was intended to prevent. It has not stimulated our commerce with the islands. Our participation in its establishment against the wishes of the natives was in plain defiance of the conservative teachings and warnings of the wise and patriotic men who laid the foundations of our free institutions, and I invite an expression of the judgment of Congress on the propriety of steps being taken by this Government looking to the withdrawal from its engagements with the other powers on some reasonable terms not prejudicial to any of our existing rights.\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury reports that the receipts of the\r\nGovernment from all sources of revenue during the fiscal year ending\r\nJune 30, 1894, amounted to $372,802,498.29 and its expenditures to\r\n$442,605,758.87, leaving a deficit of $69,803,260.58. There was a\r\ndecrease of $15,952,674.66 in the ordinary expense of the Government as\r\ncompared with the fiscal year 1893.\r\n\r\nThere was collected from customs $131,818,530.62 and from internal\r\nrevenue $147,168,449.70. The balance of the income for the year,\r\namounting to $93,815,517.97, was derived from the sales of lands and\r\nother sources.\r\n\r\nThe value of our total dutiable imports amounted to $275,199,086, being\r\n$146,657,625 less than during the preceding year, and the importations\r\nfree of duty amounted to $379,795,536, being $64,748,675 less than\r\nduring the preceding year. The receipts from customs were\r\n$73,536,486.11 less and from internal revenue $13,836,539.97 less than\r\nin 1893.\r\n\r\nThe total tax collected from distilled spirits was $85,259,250.25, on\r\nmanufactured tobacco $28,617,898.62, and on fermented liquors\r\n$31,414,788.04.\r\n\r\nOur exports of merchandise, domestic and foreign, amounted during the\r\nyear to $892,140,572, being an increase over the preceding year of\r\n$44,495,378.\r\n\r\nThe total amount of gold exported during the fiscal year was\r\n$76,898,061, as against $108,680,444 during the fiscal year 1893. The\r\namount imported was $72,449,119, as against $21,174,381 during the\r\nprevious year.\r\n\r\nThe imports of silver were $13,186,552 and the exports were $50,451,265.\r\n\r\nThe total bounty paid upon the production of sugar in the United States\r\nfor the fiscal year was $12,100,208.89, being an increase of\r\n$2,725,078.01 over the payments made during the preceding year. The\r\namount of bounty paid from July 1, 1894, to August 28, 1894, the time\r\nwhen further payments ceased by operation of law, was $966,185.84. The\r\ntotal expenses incurred in the payment of the bounty upon sugar during\r\nthe fiscal year was $130,140.85.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that upon the basis of the present revenue laws the\r\nreceipts of the Government during the current fiscal year, ending June\r\n30, 1895, will be $424,427,748.44 and its expenditures $444,427,748.44,\r\nresulting in a deficit of $20,000,000.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st day of November, 1894, the total stock of money of all kinds\r\nin the country was $2,240,773,88.8, as against $2,204,651,000 on the\r\n1st day of November, 1893, and the money of all kinds in circulation,\r\nor not included in the Treasury holdings, was $1,672,093,422, or $24.27\r\nper capita upon an estimated population of 68,887,000. At the same date\r\nthere was held in the Treasury gold bullion amounting to $44,615,177.55\r\nand silver bullion which was purchased at a cost of $127,772,988. The\r\npurchase of silver bullion under the act of July 14, 1890, ceased on\r\nthe 1st day of November, 1893, and up to that time there had been\r\npurchased during the fiscal year 11,917,658.78 fine ounces, at a cost\r\nof $8,715,521.32, an average cost of $0.7313 per fine ounce. The total\r\namount of silver purchased from the time that law took effect until the\r\nrepeal of its purchasing clause, on the date last mentioned, was\r\n168,674,682.53 fine ounces, which cost $155,931,002.25, the average\r\nprice per fine ounce being $0.9244.\r\n\r\nThe total amount of standard silver dollars coined at the mints of the\r\nUnited States since the passage of the act of February 28, 1878, is\r\n$421,776,408, of which $378,166,793 were coined under the provisions of\r\nthat act, $38,531,143 under the provisions of the act of July 14, 1890,\r\nand $5,078,472 under the act providing for the coinage of trade-dollar\r\nbullion.\r\n\r\nThe total coinage of all metals at our mints during the last fiscal\r\nyear consisted of 63,485,220 pieces, valued at $106,216,730.06, of\r\nwhich there were $99,474,912.50 in gold coined, $758 in standard silver\r\ndollars, $6,024,140.30 in subsidiary silver coin, and $716,919.26 in\r\nminor coin.\r\n\r\nDuring the calendar year 1893 the production of precious metals in the\r\nUnited States was estimated at 1,739,323 fine ounces of gold of the\r\ncommercial and coinage value of $35,955,000 and 70,000,000 fine ounces\r\nof silver of the bullion or market value of $46,800,000 and of the\r\ncoinage value of $77,576,000. It is estimated that on the 1st day of\r\nJuly, 1894, the stock of metallic money in the United States,\r\nconsisting of coin and bullion, amounted to $1,251,640,958, of which\r\n$627,923,201 was gold and $624,347,757 was silver.\r\n\r\nFifty national banks were organized during the year ending October 31,\r\n1894, with a capital of $5,285,000, and 79, with a capital of\r\n$10,475,000, went into voluntary liquidation. Twenty-one banks, with a\r\ncapital of $2,770,000, were placed in the hands of receivers. The total\r\nnumber of national banks in existence on the 31st day of October last\r\nwas 3,756, being 40 less than on the 31st day of October, 1893. The\r\ncapital stock paid in was $672,671,365, being $9,678,491 less than at\r\nthe same time in the previous year, and the surplus fund and individual\r\nprofits, less expenses and taxes paid, amounted to $334,121,082.10,\r\nwhich was $16,089,780 less than on October 31, 1893. The circulation\r\nwas decreased $1,741,563. The obligations of the banks to each other\r\nwere increased $117,268,334 and the individual deposits were\r\n$277,294,489 less than at the corresponding date in the previous year.\r\nLoans and discounts were $161,206,923 more than at the same time the\r\nprevious year, and checks and other cash items were $90,349,963 more.\r\nThe total resources of the banks at the date mentioned amounted to\r\n$3,473,922,055, as against $3,109,563,184.36 in 1893.\r\n\r\nFrom the report of the Secretary of War it appears that the strength of\r\nthe Army on September 30, 1894, was 2,135 officers and 25,765 enlisted\r\nmen. Although this is apparently a very slight decrease compared with\r\nthe previous year, the actual effective force has been increased to the\r\nequivalent of nearly two regiments through the reorganization of the\r\nsystem of recruiting and the consequent release to regimental duty of\r\nthe large force of men hitherto serving at the recruiting depots. The\r\nabolition of these depots, it is predicted, will furthermore effect an\r\nannual reduction approximating $250,000 in the direct expenditures,\r\nbesides promoting generally the health, morale, and discipline of the\r\ntroops.\r\n\r\nThe execution of the policy of concentrating the Army at important\r\ncenters of population and transportation, foreshadowed in the last\r\nannual report of the Secretary, has resulted in the abandonment of\r\nfifteen of the smaller posts, which was effected under a plan which\r\nassembles organizations of the same regiments hitherto widely\r\nseparated. This renders our small forces more readily effective for any\r\nservice which they may be called upon to perform, increases the extent\r\nof the territory under protection without diminishing the security\r\nheretofore afforded to any locality, improves the discipline, training,\r\nand esprit de corps of the Army, besides considerably decreasing the\r\ncost of its maintenance.\r\n\r\nThough the forces of the Department of the East have been somewhat\r\nincreased, more than three-fourths of the Army is still stationed west\r\nof the Mississippi. This carefully matured policy, which secures the\r\nbest and greatest service in the interests of the general welfare from\r\nthe small force comprising our Regular Army, should not be\r\nthoughtlessly embarrassed by the creation of new and unnecessary posts\r\nthrough acts of Congress to gratify the ambitions or interests of\r\nlocalities.\r\n\r\nWhile the maximum legal strength of the Army is 25,000 men, the\r\neffective strength, through various causes, is but little over 20,000\r\nmen. The purpose of Congress does not, therefore, seem to be fully\r\nattained by the existing condition. While no considerable increase in\r\nthe Army is, in my judgment, demanded by recent events, the policy of\r\nseacoast fortification, in the prosecution of which we have been\r\nsteadily engaged for some years, has so far developed as to suggest\r\nthat the effective strength of the Army be now made at least equal to\r\nthe legal strength. Measures taken by the Department during the year,\r\nas indicated, have already considerably augmented the effective force,\r\nand the Secretary of War presents a plan, which I recommend to the\r\nconsideration of Congress, to attain the desired end. Economies\r\neffected in the Department in other lines of its work will offset to a\r\ngreat extent the expenditure involved in the proposition submitted.\r\nAmong other things this contemplates the adoption of the\r\nthree-battalion formation of regiments, which for several years has\r\nbeen indorsed by the Secretaries of War and the Generals Commanding the\r\nArmy. Compact in itself, it provides a skeleton organization, ready to\r\nbe filled out in the event of war, which is peculiarly adapted to our\r\nstrength and requirements; and the fact that every other nation, with a\r\nsingle exception, has adopted this formation to meet the conditions of\r\nmodern warfare should alone secure for the recommendation an early\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to recall the fact that in obedience to the\r\ncommands of the Constitution and the laws, and for the purpose of\r\nprotecting the property of the United States, aiding the process of\r\nFederal courts, and removing lawless obstructions to the performance by\r\nthe Government of its legitimate functions, it became necessary in\r\nvarious localities during the year to employ a considerable portion of\r\nthe regular troops. The duty was discharged promptly, courageously, and\r\nwith marked discretion by the officers and men, and the most gratifying\r\nproof was thus afforded that the Army deserves that complete confidence\r\nin its efficiency and discipline which the country has at all times\r\nmanifested.\r\n\r\nThe year has been free from disturbances by Indians, and the chances of\r\nfurther depredations on their part are constantly becoming more remote\r\nand improbable.\r\n\r\nThe total .expenditures for the War Department for the year ended June\r\n30, 1894, amounted to $56,039,009.34. Of this sum $2,000,614.99 was for\r\nsalaries and contingent expenses, $23,665,156.16 for the support of the\r\nmilitary establishment, $5,001,682.23 for miscellaneous objects, and\r\n$25,371,555.96 for public works. This latter sum includes\r\n$19,494,037.49 for river and harbor improvements and $3,947,863.56 for\r\nfortifications and other works of defense. The appropriations for the\r\ncurrent year aggregate $52,429,112.78, and the estimates submitted by\r\nthe Secretary of War for the next fiscal year call for appropriations\r\namounting to $52,318,629.55.\r\n\r\nThe skill and industry of our ordnance officers and inventors have, it\r\nis believed, overcome the mechanical obstacles which have heretofore\r\ndelayed the armament of our coasts, and this great national undertaking\r\nupon which we have entered may now proceed as rapidly as Congress shall\r\ndetermine. With a supply of finished guns of large caliber already on\r\nhand, to which additions should now rapidly follow, the wisdom of\r\nproviding carriages and emplacements for their mount can not be too\r\nstrongly urged.\r\n\r\nThe total enrollment of the militia of the several States is 117,533\r\nofficers and enlisted men, an increase of 5,343 over the number\r\nreported at the close of the previous year. The reports of militia\r\ninspections by Regular Army officers show a marked increase in interest\r\nand efficiency among the State organizations, and I strongly recommend\r\na continuance of the policy of affording every practical encouragement\r\npossible to this important auxiliary of our military establishment.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the Apache Indians held as prisoners by the Government\r\nfor eight years at a cost of half a million dollars has been changed\r\nduring the year from captivity to one which gives them an opportunity\r\nto demonstrate their capacity for self-support and at least partial\r\ncivilization. Legislation enacted at the late session of Congress gave\r\nthe War Department authority to transfer the survivors, numbering 346,\r\nfrom Mount Vernon Barracks, in Alabama, to any suitable reservation.\r\nThe Department selected as their future home the military lands near\r\nFort Sill, Ind. T., where, under military surveillance, the former\r\nprisoners have been established in agriculture under conditions\r\nfavorable to their advancement.\r\n\r\nIn recognition of the long and distinguished military services and\r\nfaithful discharge of delicate and responsible civil duties by\r\nMajor-General John M. Schofield, now the General Commanding the Army,\r\nit is suggested to Congress that the temporary revival of the grade of\r\nlieutenant-general in his behalf would be a just and gracious act and\r\nwould permit his retirement, now near at hand, with rank befitting his\r\nmerits.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Attorney-General notes the gratifying progress made\r\nby the Supreme Court in overcoming the arrears of its business and in\r\nreaching a condition in which it will be able to dispose of cases as\r\nthey arise without any unreasonable delay. This result is of course\r\nvery largely due to the successful working of the plan inaugurating\r\ncircuit courts of appeals. In respect to these tribunals the suggestion\r\nis made, in quarters entitled to the highest consideration that an\r\nadditional circuit judge for each circuit would greatly strengthen\r\nthese courts and the confidence reposed in their adjudications, and\r\nthat such an addition would not create a greater force of judges than\r\nthe increasing business of such courts requires. I commend the\r\nsuggestion to the careful consideration of the Congress. Other\r\nimportant topics are adverted to in the report, accompanied by\r\nrecommendations, many of which have been treated at large in previous\r\nmessages, and at this time, therefore, need only be named. I refer to\r\nthe abolition of the fee system as a measure of compensation to Federal\r\nofficers; the enlargement of the powers of United States commissioners,\r\nat least in the Territories; the allowance of writs of error in\r\ncriminal cases on behalf of the United States, and the establishment of\r\ndegrees in the crime of murder. A topic dealt with by the\r\nAttorney-General of much importance is the condition of the\r\nadministration of justice in the Indian Territory. The permanent\r\nsolution of what is called the Indian problem is probably not to be\r\nexpected at once, but meanwhile such ameliorations of present\r\nconditions as the existing system will admit of ought not to be\r\nneglected. I am satisfied there should be a Federal court established\r\nfor the Territory, with sufficient judges, and that this court should\r\nsit within the Territory and have the same jurisdiction as to\r\nTerritorial affairs as is now vested in the Federal courts sitting in\r\nArkansas and Texas.\r\n\r\nAnother subject of pressing moment referred to by the Attorney-General\r\nis the reorganization of the Union Pacific Railway Company on a basis\r\nequitable as regards all private interests and as favorable to the\r\nGovernment as existing conditions will permit. The operation of a\r\nrailroad by a court through a receiver is an anomalous state of things\r\nwhich should be terminated on all grounds, public and private, at the\r\nearliest possible moment. Besides, not to enact the needed enabling\r\nlegislation at the present session postpones the whole matter until the\r\nassembling of a new Congress and inevitably increases all the\r\ncomplications of the situation, and could not but be regarded as a\r\nsignal failure to solve a problem which has practically been before the\r\npresent Congress ever since its organization.\r\n\r\nEight years ago in my annual message I urged upon the Congress as\r\nstrongly as I could the location and construction of two prisons for\r\nthe confinement of United States prisoners. A similar recommendation\r\nhas been made from time to time since, and a few years ago a law was\r\npassed providing for the selection of sites for three such\r\ninstitutions. No appropriation has, however, been made to carry the act\r\ninto effect, and the old and discreditable condition still exists.\r\n\r\nIt is not my purpose at this time to repeat the considerations which\r\nmake an impregnable case in favor of the ownership and management by\r\nthe Government of the penal institutions in which Federal prisoners are\r\nconfined. I simply desire to again urge former recommendations on the\r\nsubject and to particularly call the attention of the Congress to that\r\npart of the report of the Secretary of War in which he states that the\r\nmilitary prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kans., can be turned over to the\r\nGovernment as a prison for Federal convicts without the least\r\ndifficulty and with an actual saving of money from every point of view.\r\n\r\nPending a more complete reform, I hope that by the adoption of the\r\nsuggestion of the Secretary of War this easy step may be taken in the\r\ndirection of the proper care of its convicts by the Government of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General presents a comprehensive statement\r\nof the operations of the Post-Office Department for the last fiscal\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe receipts of the Department during the year amounted to\r\n$75,080,479.04 and the expenditures to $84,324,414.15.\r\n\r\nThe transactions of the postal service indicate with barometric\r\ncertainty the fluctuations in the business of the country. Inasmuch,\r\ntherefore, as business complications continued to exist throughout the\r\nlast year to an unforeseen extent, it is not surprising that the\r\ndeficiency of revenue to meet the expenditures of the Post-Office\r\nDepartment, which was estimated in advance at about $8,000,000, should\r\nbe exceeded by nearly $1,225,000. The ascertained revenues of the last\r\nyear, which were the basis of calculation for the current year, being\r\nless than estimated, the deficiency for the current year will be\r\ncorrespondingly greater, though the Postmaster-General states that the\r\nlatest indications are so favorable that he confidently predicts an\r\nincrease of at least 8 per cent in the revenues of the current year\r\nover those of the last year.\r\n\r\nThe expenditures increase steadily and necessarily with the growth and\r\nneeds of the country, so that the deficiency is greater or less in any\r\nyear, depending upon the volume of receipts.\r\n\r\nThe Postmaster-General states that this deficiency is unnecessary and\r\nmight be obviated at once if the law regulating rates upon mail matter\r\nof the second class was modified. The rate received for the\r\ntransmission of this second-class matter is 1 cent per pound, while the\r\ncost of such transmission to the Government is eight times that amount.\r\nIn the general terms of the law this rate covers newspapers and\r\nperiodicals. The extensions of the meaning of these terms from time to\r\ntime have admitted to the privileges intended for legitimate newspapers\r\nand periodicals a surprising range of publications and created abuses\r\nthe cost of which amounts in the aggregate to the total deficiency of\r\nthe Post-Office Department. Pretended newspapers are started by\r\nbusiness houses for the mere purpose of advertising goods, complying\r\nwith the law in form only and discontinuing the publications as soon as\r\nthe period of advertising is over. \"Sample copies\" of pretended\r\nnewspapers are issued in great numbers for a like purpose only. The\r\nresult is a great loss of revenue to the Government, besides its\r\nhumiliating use as an agency to aid in carrying out the scheme of a\r\nbusiness house to advertise its goods by means of a trick upon both its\r\nrival houses and the regular and legitimate newspapers. Paper-covered\r\nliterature, consisting mainly of trashy novels, to the extent of many\r\nthousands of tons is sent through the mails at 1 cent per pound, while\r\nthe publishers of standard works are required to pay eight times that\r\namount in sending their publications. Another abuse consists in the\r\nfree carriage through the mails of hundreds of tons of seed and grain\r\nuselessly distributed through the Department of Agriculture. The\r\nPostmaster-General predicts that if the law be so amended as to\r\neradicate these abuses not only will the Post-Office Department show no\r\ndeficiency, but he believes that in the near future all legitimate\r\nnewspapers and periodical magazines might be properly transmitted\r\nthrough the mails to their subscribers free of cost. I invite your\r\nprompt consideration of this subject and fully indorse the views of the\r\nPostmaster-General.\r\n\r\nThe total number of post-offices in the United States on the 30th day\r\nof June, 1894, was 69,805, an increase of 1,403 over the preceding\r\nyear. Of these, 3,428 were Presidential, an increase in that class of\r\n68 over the preceding year.\r\n\r\nSix hundred and ten cities and towns are provided with free delivery.\r\nNinety-three other cities and towns entitled to this service under the\r\nlaw have not been accorded it on account of insufficient funds. The\r\nexpense of free delivery for the current fiscal year will be more than\r\n$12,300,000, and under existing legislation this item of expenditure is\r\nsubject to constant increase. The estimated cost of rural free delivery\r\ngenerally is so very large that it ought not to be considered in the\r\npresent condition of affairs.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 830 additional domestic money-order offices were\r\nestablished. The total number of these offices at the close of the year\r\nwas 19,264. There were 14,304,041 money orders issued during the year,\r\nbeing an increase over the preceding year of 994,306. The value of\r\nthese orders amounted to $138,793,579.49, an increase of\r\n$11,217,145.84. There were also issued during the year postal notes\r\namounting to $12,649,094.55.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 218 international money-order offices were added to\r\nthose already established, making a total of 2,625 such offices in\r\noperation June 30, 1894. The number of international money orders\r\nissued during the year was 917,823, a decrease in number of 138,176,\r\nand their value was $13,792,455.31, a decrease in amount of\r\n$2,549,382.55. The number of orders paid was 361,180, an increase over\r\nthe preceding year of 60,263, and their value was $6,568,493.78, an\r\nincrease of $1,285,118.08.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing statements it appears that the total issue of money\r\norders and postal notes for the year amounted to $165,235,129.35.\r\n\r\nThe number of letters and packages mailed during the year for special\r\ndelivery was 3,436,970. The special-delivery stamps used upon these\r\nletters and packages amounted to $343,697. The messengers fees paid for\r\ntheir delivery amounted to $261,209.70, leaving a balance in favor of\r\nthe Government of $82,487.30.\r\n\r\nThe report shows most gratifying results in the way of economies worked\r\nout without affecting the efficiency of the postal service. These\r\nconsist in the abrogation of steamship subsidy contracts, reletting of\r\nmail transportation contracts, and in the cost and amount of supplies\r\nused in the service, amounting in all to $16,619,047.42.\r\n\r\nThis report also contains a valuable contribution to the history of the\r\nUniversal Postal Union, an arrangement which amounts practically to the\r\nestablishment of one postal system for the entire civilized world.\r\nSpecial attention is directed to this subject at this time in view of\r\nthe fact that the next congress of the union will meet in Washington in\r\n1897, and it is hoped that timely action will be taken in the direction\r\nof perfecting preparations for that event.\r\n\r\nThe Postmaster-General renews the suggestion made in a previous report\r\nthat the Department organization be increased to the extent of creating\r\na direct district supervision of all postal affairs, and in this\r\nsuggestion I fully concur.\r\n\r\nThere are now connected with the Post-Office establishment 32,661\r\nemployees who are in the classified service. This includes many who\r\nhave been classified upon the suggestion of the Postmaster-General. He\r\nstates that another year's experience at the head of the Department\r\nserves only to strengthen the conviction as to the excellent working of\r\nthe civil-service law in this branch of the public service.\r\n\r\nAttention is called to the report of the Secretary of the Navy, which\r\nshows very gratifying progress in the construction of ships for our new\r\nNavy. All the vessels now building, including the three torpedo boats\r\nauthorized at the last session of Congress and excepting the\r\nfirst-class battle ship Iowa, will probably be completed during the\r\ncoming fiscal year.\r\n\r\nThe estimates for the increase of the Navy for the year ending June 30,\r\n1896, are large, but they include practically the entire sum necessary\r\nto complete and equip all the new ships not now in commission, so that\r\nunless new ships are authorized the appropriations for the naval\r\nservice for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1897, should fall below the\r\nestimates for the coming year by at least $12,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary presents with much earnestness a plea for the\r\nauthorization of three additional battle ships and ten or twelve\r\ntorpedo boats. While the unarmored vessels heretofore authorized,\r\nincluding those now nearing completion, will constitute a fleet which\r\nit is believed is sufficient for ordinary cruising purposes in time of\r\npeace, we have now completed and in process of construction but four\r\nfirst-class battle ships and but few torpedo boats. If we are to have a\r\nnavy for warlike operations, offensive and defensive, we certainly\r\nought to increase both the number of battle ships and torpedo boats.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of armor requires expensive plants and the aggregation\r\nof many skilled workmen. All the armor necessary to complete the\r\nvessels now building will be delivered before the 1st of June next. If\r\nno new contracts are given out, contractors must disband their workmen\r\nand their plants must lie idle. Battle ships authorized at this time\r\nwould not be well under way until late in the coming fiscal year, and\r\nat least three years and a half from the date of the contract would be\r\nrequired for their completion. The Secretary states that not more than\r\n15 per cent of the cost of such ships need be included in the\r\nappropriations for the coming year.\r\n\r\nI recommend that provision be made for the construction of additional\r\nbattle ships and torpedo boats. The Secretary recommends the\r\nmanufacture not only of a reserve supply of ordnance and ordnance\r\nmaterial for ships of the Navy, but also a supply for the auxiliary\r\nfleet. Guns and their appurtenances should be provided and kept on hand\r\nfor both these purposes. We have not to-day a single gun that could be\r\nput upon the ships Paris or New York of the International Navigation\r\nCompany or any other ship of our reserve Navy.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of guns at the Washington Navy-Yard is proceeding\r\nsatisfactorily, and none of our new ships will be required to wait for\r\ntheir guns or ordnance equipment.\r\n\r\nAn important order has been issued by the Secretary of the Navy\r\ncoordinating the duties of the several bureaus concerned in the\r\nconstruction of ships. This order, it is believed, will secure to a\r\ngreater extent than has heretofore been possible the harmonious action\r\nof these several bureaus and make the attainment of the best results\r\nmore certain.\r\n\r\nDuring the past fiscal year there has been an unusual and pressing\r\ndemand in many quarters of the world for the presence of vessels to\r\nguard American interests.\r\n\r\nIn January last, during the Brazilian insurrection, a large fleet was\r\nconcentrated in the harbor of Rio de Janeiro. The vigorous action of\r\nRear-Admiral Benham in protecting the personal and commercial rights of\r\nour citizens during the disturbed conditions afforded results which\r\nwill, it is believed, have a far-reaching and wholesome influence\r\nwhenever in like circumstances it may become necessary for our naval\r\ncommanders to interfere on behalf of our people in foreign ports.\r\n\r\nThe war now in progress between China and Japan has rendered it\r\nnecessary or expedient to dispatch eight vessels to those waters.\r\n\r\nBoth the Secretary of the Navy and the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nrecommend the transfer of the work of the Coast Survey proper to the\r\nNavy Department. I heartily concur in this recommendation. Excluding\r\nAlaska and a very small area besides, all the work of mapping and\r\ncharting our coasts has been completed. The hydrographic work, which\r\nmust be done over and over again by reason of the shifting and varying\r\ndepths of water consequent upon the action of streams and tides, has\r\nheretofore been done under the direction of naval officers in\r\nsubordination to the Superintendent of the Coast Survey. There seems to\r\nbe no good reason why the Navy should not have entire charge hereafter\r\nof such work, especially as the Hydrographic Office of the Navy\r\nDepartment is now and has been for many years engaged in making\r\nefficient maps entirely similar to those prepared by the Coast Survey.\r\n\r\nI feel it my imperative duty to call attention to the recommendation of\r\nthe Secretary in regard to the personnel of the line of the Navy. The\r\nstagnation of promotion in this the vital branch of the service is so\r\ngreat as to seriously impair its efficiency.\r\n\r\nI consider it of the utmost importance that the young and middle-aged\r\nofficers should before the eve of retirement be permitted to reach a\r\ngrade entitling them to active and important duty.\r\n\r\nThe system adopted a few years ago regulating the employment of labor\r\nat the navy-yards is rigidly upheld and has fully demonstrated its\r\nusefulness and expediency. It is within the domain of civil-service\r\nreform inasmuch as workmen are employed through a board of labor\r\nselected at each navy-yard and are given work without reference to\r\npolitics and in the order of their application, preference, however,\r\nbeing given to Army and Navy veterans and those having former navy-yard\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nAmendments suggested by experience have been made to the rules\r\nregulating the system. Through its operation the work at our navy-yards\r\nhas been vastly improved in efficiency and the opportunity to work has\r\nbeen honestly and fairly awarded to willing and competent applicants.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that if this system continues to be strictly adhered to\r\nthere will soon be as a natural consequence such an equalization of\r\nparty benefit as will remove all temptation to relax or abandon it.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Interior exhibits the situation of\r\nthe numerous and interesting branches of the public service connected\r\nwith his Department. I commend this report and the valuable\r\nrecommendations of the Secretary to the careful attention of the\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThe public land disposed of during the year amounted to 10,406,100.77\r\nacres, including 28,876.05 of Indian lands.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that the public domain still remaining amounts to a\r\nlittle more than 600,000,000 acres, including, however, about\r\n360,000,000 acres in Alaska, as well as military reservations and\r\nrailroad and other selections of lands yet unadjudicated.\r\n\r\nThe total cash receipts from sale of lands amounted to $2,674,285.79,\r\nincluding $91,981.03 received for Indian lands.\r\n\r\nThirty-five thousand patents were issued for agricultural lands, and\r\n3,100 patents were issued to Indians on allotments of their holdings in\r\nseveralty, the land so allotted being inalienable by the Indian\r\nallottees for a period of twenty-five years after patent.\r\n\r\nThere were certified and patented on account of railroad and wagon-road\r\ngrants during the year 865,556.45 acres of land, and at the close of\r\nthe year 29,000,000 acres were embraced in the lists of selections made\r\nby railroad and wagon-road companies and awaited settlement.\r\n\r\nThe selections of swamp lands and that taken as indemnity therefor\r\nsince the passage of the act providing for the same in 1849 amount to\r\nnearly or quite 80,500,000 acres, of which 58,000,000 have been\r\npatented to States. About 138,000 acres were patented during the last\r\nyear. Nearly 820,000 acres of school and education grants were approved\r\nduring the year, and at its close 1,250,363.81 acres remained\r\nunadjusted.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the appropriation for the current year on account of\r\nspecial service for the protection of the public lands and the timber\r\nthereon is much less than those for previous years, and inadequate for\r\nan efficient performance of the work. A larger sum of money than has\r\nbeen appropriated during a number of years past on this account has\r\nbeen returned to the Government as a result of the labors of those\r\nemployed in the particular service mentioned, and I hope it will not be\r\ncrippled by insufficient appropriation.\r\n\r\nI fully indorse the recommendation of the Secretary that adequate\r\nprotection be provided for our forest reserves and that a comprehensive\r\nforestry system be inaugurated. Such keepers and superintendents as are\r\nnecessary to protect the forests already reserved should be provided.\r\n\r\nI am of the opinion that there should be an abandonment of the policy\r\nsanctioned by present laws under which the Government, for a very small\r\nconsideration, is rapidly losing title to immense tracts of land\r\ncovered with timber, which should be properly reserved as permanent\r\nsources of timber supply.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion that a change be made in the manner of securing surveys\r\nof the public lands is especially worthy of consideration. I am\r\nsatisfied that these surveys should be made by a corps of competent\r\nsurveyors under the immediate control and direction of the Commissioner\r\nof the General Land Office.\r\n\r\nAn exceedingly important recommendation of the Secretary relates to the\r\nmanner in which contests and litigated cases growing out of efforts to\r\nobtain Government land are determined. The entire testimony upon which\r\nthese controversies depend in all their stages is taken before the\r\nlocal registers and receivers, and yet these officers have no power to\r\nsubpoena witnesses or to enforce their attendance to testify. These\r\ncases, numbering three or four thousand annually, are sent by the local\r\nofficers to the Commissioner of the General Land Office for his action.\r\nThe exigencies of his other duties oblige him to act upon the decisions\r\nof the registers and receivers without an opportunity of thorough\r\npersonal examination. Nearly 2,000 of these cases are appealed annually\r\nfrom the Commissioner to the Secretary of the Interior. Burdened with\r\nother important administrative duties, his determination of these\r\nappeals must be almost perfunctory and based upon the examination of\r\nothers, though this determination of the Secretary operates as a final\r\nadjudication upon rights of very great importance.\r\n\r\nI concur in the opinion that the Commissioner of the General Land\r\nOffice should be relieved from the duty of deciding litigated land\r\ncases, that a nonpartisan court should be created to pass on such\r\ncases, and that the decisions of this court should be final, at least\r\nso far as the decisions of the Department are now final. The proposed\r\ncourt might be given authority to certify questions of law in matters\r\nof especial importance to the Supreme Court of the United States or the\r\ncourt of appeals for the District of Columbia for decision. The\r\ncreation of such a tribunal would expedite the disposal of cases and\r\ninsure decisions of a more satisfactory character. The registers and\r\nreceivers who originally hear and decide these disputes should be\r\ninvested with authority to compel witnesses to attend and testify\r\nbefore them.\r\n\r\nThough the condition of the Indians shows a steady and healthy\r\nprogress, their situation is not satisfactory at all points. Some of\r\nthem to whom allotments of land have been made are found to be unable\r\nor disinclined to follow agricultural pursuits or to otherwise\r\nbeneficially manage their land. This is especially true of the\r\nCheyennes and Arapahoes, who, as it appears by reports of their agent,\r\nhave in many instances never been located upon their allotments, and in\r\nsome cases do not even know where their allotments are. Their condition\r\nhas deteriorated. They are not self-supporting and they live in camps\r\nand spend their time in idleness.\r\n\r\nI have always believed that allotments of reservation lands to Indians\r\nin severalty should be made sparingly, or at least slowly, and with the\r\nutmost caution. In these days, when white agriculturists and stock\r\nraisers of experience and intelligence find their lot a hard one, we\r\nought not to expect Indians, unless far advanced in civilization and\r\nhabits of industry, to support themselves on the small tracts of land\r\nusually allotted to them.\r\n\r\nIf the self-supporting scheme by allotment fails, the wretched\r\npauperism of the allottees which results is worse than their original\r\ncondition of regulated dependence. It is evident that the evil\r\nconsequences of ill-advised allotment are intensified in cases where\r\nthe false step can not be retraced on account of the purchase by the\r\nGovernment of reservation lands remaining after allotments are made and\r\nthe disposition of such remaining lands to settlers or purchasers from\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\nI am convinced that the proper solution of the Indian problem and the\r\nsuccess of every step taken in that direction depend to a very large\r\nextent upon the intelligence and honesty of the reservation agents and\r\nthe interest they have in their work. An agent fitted for his place can\r\ndo much toward preparing the Indians under his charge for citizenship\r\nand allotment of their lands, and his advice as to any matter\r\nconcerning their welfare will not mislead. An unfit agent will make no\r\neffort to advance the Indians on his reservation toward civilization or\r\npreparation for allotment of lands in severalty, and his opinion as to\r\ntheir condition in this and other regards is heedless and valueless.\r\n\r\nThe indications are that the detail of army officers as Indian agents\r\nwill result in improved management on the reservations.\r\n\r\nWhenever allotments are made and any Indian on the reservation has\r\npreviously settled upon a lot and cultivated it or shown a disposition\r\nto improve it in any way, such lot should certainly be allotted to him,\r\nand this should be made plainly obligatory by statute.\r\n\r\nIn the light of experience and considering the uncertainty of the\r\nIndian situation and its exigencies in the future, I am not only\r\ndisposed to be very cautious in making allotments, but I incline to\r\nagree with the Secretary of the Interior in the opinion that when\r\nallotments are made the balance of reservation land remaining after\r\nallotment, instead of being bought by the Government from the Indians\r\nand opened for settlement with such scandals and unfair practices as\r\nseem unavoidable, should remain for a time at least as common land or\r\nbe sold by the Government on behalf of the Indians in an orderly way\r\nand at fixed prices, to be determined by its location and desirability,\r\nand that the proceeds, less expenses, should be held in trust for the\r\nbenefit of the Indian proprietors.\r\n\r\nThe intelligent Indian-school management of the past year has been\r\nfollowed by gratifying results. Efforts have been made to advance the\r\nwork in a sound and practical manner. Five institutes of Indian\r\nteachers have been held during the year, and have proved very\r\nbeneficial through the views exchanged and methods discussed\r\nparticularly applicable to Indian education.\r\n\r\nEfforts are being made in the direction of a gradual reduction of the\r\nnumber of Indian contract schools, so that in a comparatively short\r\ntime they may give way altogether to Government schools, and it is\r\nhoped that the change may be so gradual as to be perfected without too\r\ngreat expense to the Government or undue disregard of investments made\r\nby those who have established and are maintaining such contract schools.\r\n\r\nThe appropriation for the current year, ending June 30, 1895,\r\napplicable to the ordinary expenses of the Indian service amounts to\r\n$6,733,003.18, being less by $663,240.64 than the sum appropriated on\r\nthe same account for the previous year.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the last fiscal year, on the 30th day of June, 1894,\r\nthere were 969,544 persons on our pension rolls, being a net increase\r\nof 3,532 over the number reported at the end of the previous year.\r\n\r\nThese pensioners may be classified as follows: Soldiers and sailors\r\nsurvivors of all wars, 753,968; widows and relatives of deceased\r\nsoldiers, 215,162; army nurses in the War of the Rebellion, 414. Of\r\nthese pensioners 32,039 are surviving soldiers of Indian and other wars\r\nprior to the late Civil War and the widows or relatives of such\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\nThe remainder, numbering 937,505, are receiving pensions on account of\r\nthe rebellion, and of these 469,344 are on the rolls under the\r\nauthority of the act of June 27, 1890, sometimes called the\r\ndependent-pension law.\r\n\r\nThe total amount expended for pensions during the year was\r\n$139,804,461.05, leaving an unexpended balance from the sum\r\nappropriated of $25,205,712.65.\r\n\r\nThe sum necessary to meet pension expenditures for the year ending June\r\n30, 1896, is estimated at $140,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner of Pensions is of the opinion that the year 1895,\r\nbeing the thirtieth after the close of the War of the Rebellion, must,\r\naccording to all sensible human calculation, see the highest limit of\r\nthe pension roll, and that after that year it must begin to decline.\r\n\r\nThe claims pending in the Bureau have decreased more than 90,000 during\r\nthe year. A large proportion of the new claims filed are for increase\r\nof pension by those now on the rolls.\r\n\r\nThe number of certificates issued was 80,213.\r\n\r\nThe names dropped from the rolls for all causes during the year\r\nnumbered 37,951.\r\n\r\nAmong our pensioners are 9 widows and 3 daughters of soldiers of the\r\nRevolution and 45 survivors of the War of 1812.\r\n\r\nThe barefaced and extensive pension frauds exposed under the direction\r\nof the courageous and generous veteran soldier now at the head of the\r\nBureau leave no room for the claim that no purgation of our pension\r\nrolls was needed or that continued vigilance and prompt action are not\r\nnecessary to the same end.\r\n\r\nThe accusation that an effort to detect pension frauds is evidence of\r\nunfriendliness toward our worthy veterans and a denial of their claims\r\nto the generosity of the Government suggests an unfortunate\r\nindifference to the commission of any offense which has for its motive\r\nthe securing of a pension and indicates a willingness to be blind to\r\nthe existence of mean and treacherous crimes which play upon demagogic\r\nfears and make sport of the patriotic impulse of a grateful people.\r\n\r\nThe completion of the Eleventh Census is now in charge of the\r\nCommissioner of Labor. The total disbursements on account of the work\r\nfor the fiscal year ending June 30, 1894, amounted to $10,365,676.81.\r\nAt the close of the year the number of persons employed in the Census\r\nOffice was 679; at present there are about 400. The whole number of\r\nvolumes necessary to comprehend the Eleventh Census will be 25, and\r\nthey will contain 22,270 printed pages. The assurance is confidently\r\nmade that before the close of the present calendar year the material\r\nstill incomplete will be practically in hand, and the census can\r\ncertainly be closed by the 4th of March, 1895. After that the revision\r\nand proof reading necessary to bring out the volumes will still be\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nThe text of the census volumes has been limited as far as possible to\r\nthe analysis of the statistics presented. This method, which is in\r\naccordance with law, has caused more or less friction and in some\r\ninstances individual disappointment, for when the Commissioner of Labor\r\ntook charge of the work he found much matter on hand which according to\r\nthis rule he was compelled to discard. The census is being prepared\r\naccording to the theory that it is designed to collect facts and\r\ncertify them to the public, not to elaborate arguments or to present\r\npersonal views.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of Agriculture in his report reviews the operations of\r\nhis Department for the last fiscal year and makes recommendations for\r\nthe further extension of its usefulness. He reports a saving in\r\nexpenditures during the year of $600,000, which is covered back into\r\nthe Treasury. This sum is 23 per cent of the entire appropriation.\r\n\r\nA special study has been made of the demand for American farm products\r\nin all foreign markets, especially Great Britain, That country received\r\nfrom the United States during the nine months ending September 30,\r\n1894, 305,910 live beef cattle, valued at $26,500,000, as against\r\n182,611 cattle, valued at $16,634,000, during the same period for 1893.\r\n\r\nDuring the first six months of 1894 the United Kingdom took also\r\n112,000,000 pounds of dressed beef from the United States, valued at\r\nnearly $10,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe report shows that during the nine months immediately preceding\r\nSeptember 30, 1894, the United States exported to Great Britain\r\n222,676,000 pounds of pork; of apples, 1,900,000 bushels, valued at\r\n$2,500,000, and of horses 2,811, at an average value of $139 per head.\r\nThere was a falling off in American wheat exports of 13,500,000\r\nbushels, and the Secretary is inclined to believe that wheat may not in\r\nthe future be the staple export cereal product of our country, but that\r\ncorn will continue to advance in importance as an export on account of\r\nthe new uses to which it is constantly being appropriated.\r\n\r\nThe exports of agricultural products from the United States for the\r\nfiscal year ending June 30, 1894, amounted to $628,363,038, being 72.28\r\nper cent of American exports of every description, and the United\r\nKingdom of Great Britain took more than 54 per cent of all farm\r\nproducts finding foreign markets.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Agriculture has undertaken during the year two new\r\nand important lines of research. The first relates to grasses and\r\nforage plants, with the purpose of instructing and familiarizing the\r\npeople as to the distinctive grasses of the United States and teaching\r\nthem how to introduce valuable foreign forage plants which may be\r\nadapted to this country. The second relates to agricultural soils and\r\ncrop production, involving the analyses of samples of soils from all\r\nsections of the American Union, to demonstrate their adaptability to\r\nparticular plants and crops. Mechanical analyses of soils may be of\r\nsuch inestimable utility that it is foremost in the new lines of\r\nagricultural research, and the Secretary therefore recommends that a\r\ndivision having it in charge be permanently established in the\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\nThe amount appropriated for the Weather Bureau was $951,100. Of that\r\nsum $138,500, or 14 per cent, has been saved and is returned to the\r\nTreasury.\r\n\r\nAs illustrating the usefulness of this service it may be here stated\r\nthat the warnings which were very generally given of two tropical\r\nstorms occurring in September and October of the present year resulted\r\nin detaining safely in port 2,305 vessels, valued at $36,183,913, laden\r\nwith cargoes of probably still greater value. What is much more\r\nimportant and gratifying, many human lives on these ships were also\r\nundoubtedly saved.\r\n\r\nThe appropriation to the Bureau of Animal Industry was $850,000, and\r\nthe expenditures for the year were only $495,429.24, thus leaving\r\nunexpended $354,570.76. The inspection of beef animals for export and\r\ninterstate trade has been continued, and 12,944,056 head were inspected\r\nduring the year, at a cost of 1 3/4 cents per head, against 4 3/4 cents\r\nfor 1893. The amount of pork microscopically examined was 35,437,937\r\npounds, against 20,677,410 pounds in the preceding year. The cost of\r\nthis inspection has been diminished from 8 3/4 cents per head in 1893\r\nto 6 1/2 cents in 1894.\r\n\r\nThe expense of inspecting the pork sold in 1894 to Germany and France\r\nby the United States was $88,922.10. The quantity inspected was greater\r\nby 15,000,000 pounds than during the preceding year, when the cost of\r\nsuch inspection was $172,367.08. The Secretary of Agriculture\r\nrecommends that the law providing for the microscopic inspection of\r\nexport and interstate meat be so amended as to compel owners of the\r\nmeat inspected to pay the cost of such inspection, and I call attention\r\nto the arguments presented in his report in support of this\r\nrecommendation.\r\n\r\nThe live beef cattle exported and tagged during the year numbered\r\n353,535. This is an increase of 69,533 head over the previous year.\r\n\r\nThe sanitary inspection of cattle shipped to Europe has cost an average\r\nof 10 3/4 cents for each animal, and the cost of inspecting Southern\r\ncattle and the disinfection of cars and stock yards averages 2.7 cents\r\nper animal.\r\n\r\nThe scientific inquiries of the Bureau of Animal Industry have\r\nprogressed steadily during the year. Much tuberculin and mallein have\r\nbeen furnished to State authorities for use in the agricultural\r\ncolleges and experiment stations for the treatment of tuberculosis and\r\nglanders.\r\n\r\nQuite recently this Department has published the results of its\r\ninvestigations of bovine tuberculosis, and its researches will be\r\nvigorously continued. Certain herds in the District of Columbia will be\r\nthoroughly inspected and will probably supply adequate scope for the\r\nDepartment to intelligently prosecute its scientific work and furnish\r\nsufficient material for purposes of illustration, description, and\r\ndefinition.\r\n\r\nThe sterilization of milk suspected of containing the bacilli of\r\ntuberculosis has been during the year very thoroughly explained in a\r\nleaflet by Dr. D. E. Salmon, the Chief of the Bureau, and given general\r\ncirculation throughout the country.\r\n\r\nThe Office of Experiment Stations, which is a part of the United States\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, has during the past year engaged itself\r\nalmost wholly in preparing for publication works based upon the reports\r\nof agricultural experiment stations and other institutions for\r\nagricultural inquiry in the United States and foreign countries.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary in his report for 1893 called attention to the fact that\r\nthe appropriations made for the support of the experiment stations\r\nthroughout the Union were the only moneys taken out of the National\r\nTreasury by act of Congress for which no accounting to Federal\r\nauthorities was required. Responding to this suggestion, the\r\nFifty-third Congress, in making the appropriation for the Department\r\nfor the present fiscal year, provided that--\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of Agriculture shall prescribe the form of annual\r\nfinancial statement required by section 3 of said act of March 2, 1887;\r\nshall ascertain whether the expenditures under the appropriation hereby\r\nmade are in accordance with the provisions of said act, and shall make\r\nreport thereon to Congress.\r\n In obedience to this law the Department of Agriculture immediately sent out blank forms of expense accounts to each station, and proposes in addition to make, through trusted experts, systematic examination of the several stations during each year for the purpose of acquiring by personal investigation the detailed information necessary to enable the Secretary of Agriculture to make, as the statute provides, a satisfactory report to Congress. The boards of management of the several stations with great alacrity and cordiality have approved the amendment to the law providing this supervision of their expenditures, anticipating that it will increase the efficiency of the stations and protect their directors and managers from loose charges concerning their use of public funds, besides bringing the Department of Agriculture into closer and more confidential relations with the experimental stations, and through their joint service largely increasing their usefulness to the agriculture of the country.\r\nActing upon a recommendation contained in the report of 1893, Congress\r\nappropriated $10,000 \"to enable the Secretary of Agriculture to\r\ninvestigate and report upon the nutritive value of the various articles\r\nand commodities used for human food, with special suggestions of full,\r\nwholesome, and edible rations less wasteful and more economical than\r\nthose in common use.\"\r\n\r\nUnder this appropriation the Department has prepared and now has nearly\r\nready for distribution an elementary discussion of the nutritive value\r\nand pecuniary economy of food. When we consider that fully one-half of\r\nall the money earned by the wage earners of the civilized world is\r\nexpended by them for food, the importance and utility of such an\r\ninvestigation is apparent.\r\n\r\nThe Department expended in the fiscal year 1893 $2,354,809.56, and out\r\nof that sum the total amount expended in scientific research was 45.6\r\nper cent. But in the year ending June 30, 1894, out of a total\r\nexpenditure of $1,948,988.38, the Department applied 51.8 per cent of\r\nthat sum to scientific work and investigation. It is therefore very\r\nplainly observable that the economies which have been practiced in the\r\nadministration of the Department have not been at the expense of\r\nscientific research.\r\n\r\nThe recommendation contained in the report of the Secretary for 1893\r\nthat the vicious system of promiscuous free distribution of its\r\ndepartmental documents be abandoned is again urged. These publications\r\nmay well be furnished without cost to public libraries, educational\r\ninstitutions, and the officers and libraries of States and of the\r\nFederal Government; but from all individuals applying for them a price\r\ncovering the cost of the document asked for should be required. Thus\r\nthe publications and documents would be secured by those who really\r\ndesire them for proper purposes. Half a million of copies of the report\r\nof the Secretary of Agriculture are printed for distribution, at an\r\nannual cost of about $300,000. Large numbers of them are cumbering\r\nstorerooms at the Capitol and the shelves of secondhand-book stores\r\nthroughout the country. All this labor and waste might be avoided if\r\nthe recommendations of the Secretary were adopted.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary also again recommends that the gratuitous distribution of\r\nseeds cease and that no money be appropriated for that purpose except\r\nto experiment stations. He reiterates the reasons given in his report\r\nfor 1893 for discontinuing this unjustifiable gratuity, and I fully\r\nconcur in the conclusions which he has reached.\r\n\r\nThe best service of the statistician of the Department of Agriculture\r\nis the ascertainment, by diligence and care, of the actual and real\r\nconditions, favorable or unfavorable, of the farmers and farms of the\r\ncountry, and to seek the causes which produce these conditions, to the\r\nend that the facts ascertained may guide their intelligent treatment.\r\n\r\nA further important utility in agricultural statistics is found in\r\ntheir elucidation of the relation of the supply of farm products to the\r\ndemand for them in the markets of the United States and of the world.\r\n\r\nIt is deemed possible that an agricultural census may be taken each\r\nyear through the agents of the statistical division of the Department.\r\nSuch a course is commended for trial by the chief of that division. Its\r\nscope would be:\r\n (1) The area under each of the more important crops.\r\n (2) The aggregate products of each of such crops.\r\n (3) The quantity of wheat and corn in the hands of farmers at a date after the spring sowings and plantings and before the beginning of harvest, and also the quantity of cotton and tobacco remaining in the hands of planters, either at the same date or at some other designated time.\r\n\r\nThe cost of the work is estimated at $500,000.\r\n\r\nOwing to the peculiar quality of the statistician's work and the\r\nnatural and acquired fitness necessary to its successful prosecution,\r\nthe Secretary of Agriculture expresses the opinion that every person\r\nemployed in gathering statistics under the chief of that division\r\nshould be admitted to that service only after a thorough, exhaustive,\r\nand successful examination at the hands of the United States Civil\r\nService Commission. This has led him to call for such examination of\r\ncandidates for the position of assistant statisticians, and also of\r\ncandidates for chiefs of sections in that division.\r\n\r\nThe work done by the Department of Agriculture is very superficially\r\ndealt with in this communication, and I commend the report of the\r\nSecretary and the very important interests with which it deals to the\r\ncareful attention of the Congress.\r\n\r\nThe advantages to the public service of an adherence to the principles\r\nof civil-service reform are constantly more apparent, and nothing is so\r\nencouraging to those in official life who honestly desire good\r\ngovernment as the increasing appreciation by our people of these\r\nadvantages. A vast majority of the voters of the land are ready to\r\ninsist that the time and attention of those they select to perform for\r\nthem important public duties should not be distracted by doling out\r\nminor offices, and they are growing to be unanimous in regarding party\r\norganization as something that should be used in establishing party\r\nprinciples instead of dictating the distribution of public places as\r\nrewards of partisan activity.\r\n\r\nNumerous additional offices and places have lately been brought within\r\ncivil-service rules and regulations, and some others will probably soon\r\nbe included.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Commissioners will be submitted to the Congress, and\r\nI invite careful attention to the recommendations it contains.\r\n\r\nI am entirely convinced that we ought not to be longer without a\r\nnational board of health or national health officer charged with no\r\nother duties than such as pertain to the protection of our country from\r\nthe invasion of pestilence and disease. This would involve the\r\nestablishment by such board or officer of proper quarantine\r\nprecautions, or the necessary aid and counsel to local authorities on\r\nthe subject; prompt advice and assistance to local boards of health or\r\nhealth officers in the suppression of contagious disease, and in cases\r\nwhere there are no such local boards or officers the immediate\r\ndirection by the national board or officer of measures of suppression;\r\nconstant and authentic information concerning the health of foreign\r\ncountries and all parts of our own country as related to contagious\r\ndiseases, and consideration of regulations to be enforced in foreign\r\nports to prevent the introduction of contagion into our cities and the\r\nmeasures which should be adopted to secure their enforcement.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be at this time a decided inclination to discuss\r\nmeasures of protection against contagious diseases in international\r\nconference, with a view of adopting means of mutual assistance. The\r\ncreation of such a national health establishment would greatly aid our\r\nstanding in such conferences and improve our opportunities to avail\r\nourselves of their benefits.\r\n\r\nI earnestly recommend the inauguration of a national board of health or\r\nsimilar national instrumentality, believing the same to be a needed\r\nprecaution against contagious disease and in the interest of the safety\r\nand health of our people.\r\n\r\nBy virtue of a statute of the United States passed in 1888 I appointed\r\nin July last Hon. John D. Kernan, of the State of New York, and Hon.\r\nNicholas E. Worthington, of the State of Illinois, to form, with Hon.\r\nCarroll D. Wright, Commissioner of Labor, who was designated by said\r\nstatute, a commission for the purpose of making careful inquiry into\r\nthe causes of the controversies between certain railroads and their\r\nemployees which had resulted in an extensive and destructive strike,\r\naccompanied by much violence and dangerous disturbance, with\r\nconsiderable loss of life and great destruction of property.\r\n\r\nThe report of the commissioners has been submitted to me and will be\r\ntransmitted to the Congress with the evidence taken upon their\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nTheir work has been well done, and their standing and intelligence give\r\nassurance that the report and suggestions they make are worthy of\r\ncareful consideration.\r\n\r\nThe tariff act passed at the last session of the Congress needs\r\nimportant amendments if it is to be executed effectively and with\r\ncertainty. In addition to such necessary amendments as will not change\r\nrates of duty, I am still very decidedly in favor of putting coal and\r\niron upon the free list.\r\n\r\nSo far as the sugar schedule is concerned, I would be glad, under\r\nexisting aggravations, to see every particle of differential duty in\r\nfavor of refined sugar stricken out of our tariff law. If with all the\r\nfavor now accorded the sugar-refining interest in our tariff laws it\r\nstill languishes to the extent of closed refineries and thousands of\r\ndischarged workmen, it would seem to present a hopeless case for\r\nreasonable legislative aid. Whatever else is done or omitted, I\r\nearnestly repeat here the recommendation I have made in another portion\r\nof this communication, that the additional duty of one-tenth of a cent\r\nper pound laid upon sugar imported from countries paying a bounty on\r\nits export be abrogated. It seems to me that exceedingly important\r\nconsiderations point to the propriety of this amendment.\r\n\r\nWith the advent of a new tariff policy not only calculated to relieve\r\nthe consumers of our land in the cost of their daily life, but to\r\ninvite a better development of American thrift and create for us closer\r\nand more profitable commercial relations with the rest of the world, it\r\nfollows as a logical and imperative necessity that we should at once\r\nremove the chief if not the only obstacle which has so long prevented\r\nour participation in the foreign carrying trade of the sea. A tariff\r\nbuilt upon the theory that it is well to check imports and that a home\r\nmarket should bound the industry and effort of American producers was\r\nfitly supplemented by a refusal to allow American registry to vessels\r\nbuilt abroad, though owned and navigated by our people, thus exhibiting\r\na willingness to abandon all contest for the advantages of American\r\ntransoceanic carriage. Our new tariff policy, built upon the theory\r\nthat it is well to encourage such importations as our people need, and\r\nthat our products and manufactures should find markets in every part of\r\nthe habitable globe, is consistently supplemented by the greatest\r\npossible liberty to our citizens in the ownership and navigation of\r\nships in which our products and manufactures may be transported. The\r\nmillions now paid to foreigners for carrying American passengers and\r\nproducts across the sea should be turned into American hands.\r\nShipbuilding, which has been protected to strangulation, should be\r\nrevived by the prospect of profitable employment for ships when built,\r\nand the American sailor should be resurrected and again take his\r\nplace--a sturdy and industrious citizen in time of peace and a\r\npatriotic and safe defender of American interests in the day of\r\nconflict.\r\n\r\nThe ancient provision of our law denying American registry to ships\r\nbuilt abroad and owned by Americans appears in the light of present\r\nconditions not only to be a failure for good at every point, but to be\r\nnearer a relic of barbarism than anything that exists under the\r\npermission of a statute of the United States. I earnestly recommend its\r\nprompt repeal.\r\n\r\nDuring the last month the gold reserved in the Treasury for the purpose\r\nof redeeming the notes of the Government circulating as money in the\r\nhands of the people became so reduced and its further depletion in the\r\nnear future seemed so certain that in the exercise of proper care for\r\nthe public welfare it became necessary to replenish this reserve and\r\nthus maintain popular faith in the ability and determination of the\r\nGovernment to meet as agreed its pecuniary obligations.\r\n\r\nIt would have been well if in this emergency authority had existed to\r\nissue the bonds of the Government bearing a low rate of interest and\r\nmaturing within a short period; but the Congress having failed to\r\nconfer such authority, resort was necessarily had to the resumption act\r\nof 1875, and pursuant to its provisions bonds were issued drawing\r\ninterest at the rate of 5 per cent per annum and maturing ten years\r\nafter their issue, that being the shortest time authorized by the act.\r\nI am glad to say, however, that on the sale of these bonds the premium\r\nreceived operated to reduce the rate of interest to be paid by the\r\nGovernment to less than 3 per cent.\r\n\r\nNothing could be worse or further removed from sensible finance than\r\nthe relations existing between the currency the Government has issued,\r\nthe gold held for its redemption, and the means which must be resorted\r\nto for the purpose of replenishing such redemption fund when impaired.\r\nEven if the claims upon this fund were confined to the obligations\r\noriginally intended and if the redemption of these obligations meant\r\ntheir cancellation, the fund would be very small. But these obligations\r\nwhen received and redeemed in gold are not canceled, but are reissued\r\nand may do duty many times by way of drawing gold from the Treasury.\r\nThus we have an endless chain in operation constantly depleting the\r\nTreasury's gold and never near a final rest. As if this was not bad\r\nenough, we have, by a statutory declaration that it is the policy of\r\nthe Government to maintain the parity between gold and silver, aided\r\nthe force and momentum of this exhausting process and added largely to\r\nthe currency obligations claiming this peculiar gold redemption. Our\r\nsmall gold reserve is thus subject to drain from every side. The\r\ndemands that increase our danger also increase the necessity of\r\nprotecting this reserve against depletion, and it is most\r\nunsatisfactory to know that the protection afforded is only a temporary\r\npalliation.\r\n\r\nIt is perfectly and palpably plain that the only way under present\r\nconditions by which this reserve when dangerously depleted can be\r\nreplenished is through the issue and sale of the bonds of the\r\nGovernment for gold, and yet Congress has not only thus far declined to\r\nauthorize the issue of bonds best suited to such a purpose, but there\r\nseems a disposition in some quarters to deny both the necessity and\r\npower for the issue of bonds at all.\r\n\r\nI can not for a moment believe that any of our citizens are\r\ndeliberately willing that their Government should default in its\r\npecuniary obligations or that its financial operations should be\r\nreduced to a silver basis. At any rate, I should not feel that my duty\r\nwas done if I omitted any effort I could make to avert such a calamity.\r\nAs long, therefore, as no provision is made for the final redemption or\r\nthe putting aside of the currency obligation now used to repeatedly and\r\nconstantly draw from the Government its gold, and as long as no better\r\nauthority for bond issues is allowed than at present exists, such\r\nauthority will be utilized whenever and as often as it becomes\r\nnecessary to maintain a sufficient gold reserve, and in abundant time\r\nto save the credit of our country and make good the financial\r\ndeclarations of our Government.\r\n\r\nQuestions relating to our banks and currency are closely connected with\r\nthe subject just referred to, and they also present some unsatisfactory\r\nfeatures. Prominent among them are the lack of elasticity in our\r\ncurrency circulation and its frequent concentration in financial\r\ncenters when it is most needed in other parts of the country.\r\n\r\nThe absolute divorcement of the Government from the business of banking\r\nis the ideal relationship of the Government to the circulation of the\r\ncurrency of the country.\r\n\r\nThis condition can not be immediately reached, but as a step in that\r\ndirection and as a means of securing a more elastic currency and\r\nobviating other objections to the present arrangement of bank\r\ncirculation the Secretary of the Treasury presents in his report a\r\nscheme modifying present banking laws and providing for the issue of\r\ncirculating notes by State banks free from taxation under certain\r\nlimitations.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary explains his plan so plainly and its advantages are\r\ndeveloped by him with such remarkable clearness that any effort on my\r\npart to present argument in its support would be superfluous. I shall\r\ntherefore content myself with an unqualified indorsement of the\r\nSecretary's proposed changes in the law and a brief and imperfect\r\nstatement of their prominent features.\r\n It is proposed to repeal all laws providing for the deposit of United States bonds as security for circulation; to permit national banks to issue circulating notes not exceeding in amount 75 per cent of their paid-up and unimpaired capital, provided they deposit with the Government as a guaranty fund, in United States legal-tender notes, including Treasury notes of 1890, a sum equal in amount to 30 per cent of the notes they desire to issue, this deposit to be maintained at all times, but whenever any bank retires any part of its circulation a proportional part of its guaranty fund shall be returned to it; to permit the Secretary of the Treasury to prepare and keep on hand ready for issue in case an increase in circulation is desired blank national-bank notes for each bank having circulation and to repeal the provisions of the present law imposing limitations and restrictions upon banks desiring to reduce or increase their circulation, thus permitting such increase or reduction within the limit of 75 per cent of capital to be quickly made as emergencies arise.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the guaranty fund required, it is proposed to provide a\r\nsafety fund for the immediate redemption of the circulating notes of\r\nfailed banks by imposing a small annual tax, say one-half of 1 per\r\ncent, upon the average circulation of each bank until the fund amounts\r\nto 5 per cent of the total circulation outstanding. When a bank fails\r\nits guaranty fund is to be paid into this safety fund and its notes are\r\nto be redeemed in the first instance from such safety fund thus\r\naugmented, any impairment of such fund caused thereby to be made good\r\nfrom the immediately available cash assets of said bank, and if these\r\nshould be insufficient such impairment to be made good by pro rata\r\nassessment among the other banks, their contributions constituting a\r\nfirst lien upon the assets of the failed bank in favor of the\r\ncontributing banks. As a further security it is contemplated that the\r\nexisting provision fixing the individual liability of stockholders is\r\nto be retained and the bank's indebtedness on account of its\r\ncirculating notes is to be made a first lien on all its assets.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of meeting the expense of printing notes, official\r\nsupervision, cancellation, and other like charges there shall be\r\nimposed a tax of say one-half of 1 per cent per annum upon the average\r\namount of notes in circulation.\r\n\r\nIt is further provided that there shall be no national-bank notes\r\nissued of a less denomination than $10; that each national bank, except\r\nin case of a failed bank, shall redeem or retire its notes in the first\r\ninstance at its own office or at agencies to be designated by it, and\r\nthat no fixed reserve need be maintained on account of deposits.\r\n\r\nAnother very important feature of this plan is the exemption of State\r\nbanks from taxation by the United States in cases where it is shown to\r\nthe satisfaction of the Secretary of the Treasury and Comptroller of\r\nthe Currency by banks claiming such exemption that they have not had\r\noutstanding their circulating notes exceeding 75 per cent of their\r\npaid-up and unimpaired capital; that their stockholders are\r\nindividually liable for the redemption of their circulating notes to\r\nthe full extent of their ownership of stock; that the liability of said\r\nbanks upon their circulating notes constitutes under their State law a\r\nfirst lien upon their assets; that such banks have kept and maintained\r\na guaranty fund in United States legal-tender notes, including Treasury\r\nnotes of 1890, equal to 30 per cent of their outstanding circulating\r\nnotes, and that such banks have promptly redeemed their circulating\r\nnotes when presented at their principal or branch offices.\r\n\r\nIt is quite likely that this scheme may be usefully amended in some of\r\nits details, but I am satisfied it furnishes a basis for a very great\r\nimprovement in our present banking and currency system.\r\n\r\nI conclude this communication fully appreciating that the\r\nresponsibility for all legislation affecting the people of the United\r\nStates rests upon their representatives in the Congress, and assuring\r\nthem that, whether in accordance with recommendations I have made or\r\nnot, I shall be glad to cooperate in perfecting any legislation that\r\ntends to the prosperity and welfare of our country.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nGrover Cleveland\r\nDecember 2, 1895\r\n\r\nTo the Congress of the United States:\r\n\r\nThe present assemblage of the legislative branch of our Government\r\noccurs at a time when the interests of our people and the needs of the\r\ncountry give especial prominence to the condition of our foreign\r\nrelations and the exigencies of our national finances. The reports of\r\nthe heads of the several administrative Departments of the Government\r\nfully and plainly exhibit what has been accomplished within the scope\r\nof their respective duties and present such recommendations for the\r\nbetterment of our country's condition as patriotic and intelligent\r\nlabor and observation suggest.\r\n\r\nI therefore deem my executive duty adequately performed at this time by\r\npresenting to the Congress the important phases of our situation as\r\nrelated to our intercourse with foreign nations and a statement of the\r\nfinancial problems which confront us, omitting, except as they are\r\nrelated to these topics, any reference to departmental operations.\r\n\r\nI earnestly invite, however, not only the careful consideration but the\r\nseverely critical scrutiny of the Congress and my fellow-countrymen to\r\nthe reports concerning these departmental operations. If justly and\r\nfairly examined, they will furnish proof of assiduous and painstaking\r\ncare for the public welfare. I press the recommendations they contain\r\nupon the respectful attention of those charged with the duty of\r\nlegislation, because I believe their adoption would promote the\r\npeople's good.\r\n\r\nBy amendatory tariff legislation in January last the Argentine\r\nRepublic, recognizing the value of the large market opened to the free\r\nimportation of its wools under our last tariff act, has admitted\r\ncertain products of the United States to entry at reduced duties. It is\r\npleasing to note that the efforts we have made to enlarge the exchanges\r\nof trade on a sound basis of mutual benefit are in this instance\r\nappreciated by the country from which our woolen factories draw their\r\nneedful supply of raw material.\r\n\r\nThe Missions boundary dispute between the Argentine Republic and\r\nBrazil, referred to the President of the United States as arbitrator\r\nduring the term of my predecessor, and which was submitted to me for\r\ndetermination, resulted in an award in favor of Brazil upon the\r\nhistorical and documentary evidence presented, thus ending a\r\nlong-protracted controversy and again demonstrating the wisdom and\r\ndesirability of settling international boundary disputes by recourse to\r\nfriendly arbitration.\r\n\r\nNegotiations are progressing for a revival of the United States and\r\nChilean Claims Commission, whose work was abruptly terminated last year\r\nby the expiration of the stipulated time within which awards could be\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nThe resumption of specie payments by Chile is a step of great interest\r\nand importance both in its direct consequences upon her own welfare and\r\nas evincing the ascendency of sound financial principles in one of the\r\nmost influential of the South American Republics.\r\n\r\nThe close of the momentous struggle between China and Japan, while\r\nrelieving the diplomatic agents of this Government from the delicate\r\nduty they undertook at the request of both countries of rendering such\r\nservice to the subjects of either belligerent within the territorial\r\nlimits of the other as our neutral position permitted, developed a\r\ndomestic condition in the Chinese Empire which has caused much anxiety\r\nand called for prompt and careful attention. Either as a result of a\r\nweak control by the central Government over the provincial\r\nadministrations, following a diminution of traditional governmental\r\nauthority under the stress of an overwhelming national disaster, or as\r\na manifestation upon good opportunity of the aversion of the Chinese\r\npopulation to all foreign ways and undertakings, there have occurred in\r\nwidely separated provinces of China serious outbreaks of the old\r\nfanatical spirit against foreigners, which, unchecked by the local\r\nauthorities, if not actually connived at by them, have culminated in\r\nmob attacks on foreign missionary stations, causing much destruction of\r\nproperty and attended with personal injuries as well as loss of life.\r\n\r\nAlthough but one American citizen was reported to have been actually\r\nwounded, and although the destruction of property may have fallen more\r\nheavily upon the missionaries of other nationalities than our own, it\r\nplainly behooved this Government to take the most prompt and decided\r\naction to guard against similar or perhaps more dreadful calamities\r\nbefalling the hundreds of American mission stations which have grown up\r\nthroughout the interior of China under the temperate rule of\r\ntoleration, custom, and imperial edict. The demands of the United\r\nStates and other powers for the degradation and punishment of the\r\nresponsible officials of the respective cities and provinces who by\r\nneglect or otherwise had permitted uprisings, and for the adoption of\r\nstern measures by the Emperor's Government for the protection of the\r\nlife and property of foreigners, were followed by the disgrace and\r\ndismissal of certain provincial officials found derelict in duty and\r\nthe punishment by death of a number of those adjudged guilty of actual\r\nparticipation in the outrages.\r\n\r\nThis Government also insisted that a special American commission should\r\nvisit the province where the first disturbances occurred for the\r\npurpose of investigation. The latter commission, formed after much\r\nopposition, has gone overland from Tientsin, accompanied by a suitable\r\nChinese escort, and by its demonstration of the readiness and ability\r\nof our Government to protect its citizens will act, it is believed, as\r\na most influential deterrent of any similar outbreaks.\r\n\r\nThe energetic steps we have thus taken are all the more likely to\r\nresult in future safety to our citizens in China because the Imperial\r\nGovernment is, I am persuaded, entirely convinced that we desire only\r\nthe liberty and protection of our own citizens and redress for any\r\nwrongs they may have suffered, and that we have no ulterior designs or\r\nobjects, political or otherwise. China will not forget either our\r\nkindly service to her citizens during her late war nor the further fact\r\nthat, while furnishing all the facilities at our command to further the\r\nnegotiation of a peace between her and Japan, we sought no advantages\r\nand interposed no counsel.\r\n\r\nThe Governments of both China and Japan have, in special dispatches\r\ntransmitted through their respective diplomatic representatives,\r\nexpressed in a most pleasing manner their grateful appreciation of our\r\nassistance to their citizens during the unhappy struggle and of the\r\nvalue of our aid in paving the way to their resumption of peaceful\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\nThe customary cordial relations between this country and France have\r\nbeen undisturbed, with the exception that a full explanation of the\r\ntreatment of John L. Waller by the expeditionary military authorities\r\nof France still remains to be given. Mr. Waller, formerly United States\r\nconsul at Tamatav, remained in Madagascar after his term of office\r\nexpired, and was apparently successful in procuring business\r\nconcessions from the Hovas of greater or less value. After the\r\noccupation of Tamatav and the declaration of martial law by the French\r\nhe was arrested upon various charges, among them that of communicating\r\nmilitary information to the enemies of France, was tried and convicted\r\nby a military tribunal, and sentenced to twenty years' imprisonment.\r\n\r\nFollowing the course justified by abundant precedents, this Government\r\nrequested from that of France the record of the proceedings of the\r\nFrench tribunal which resulted in Mr. Waller's condemnation. This\r\nrequest has been complied with to the extent of supplying a copy of the\r\nofficial record, from which appear the constitution and organization of\r\nthe court, the charges as formulated, and the general course and result\r\nof the trial, and by which it is shown that the accused was tried in\r\nopen court and was defended by counsel; but the evidence adduced in\r\nsupport of the charges, which was not received by the French minister\r\nfor foreign affairs till the first week in October, has thus far been\r\nwithheld, the French Government taking the ground that its production\r\nin response to our demand would establish a bad precedent. The efforts\r\nof our ambassador to procure it, however, though impeded by recent\r\nchanges in the French ministry, have not been relaxed, and it is\r\nconfidently expected that some satisfactory solution of the matter will\r\nshortly be reached. Meanwhile it appears that Mr. Waller's confinement\r\nhas every alleviation which the state of his health and all the other\r\ncircumstances of the case demand or permit.\r\n\r\nIn agreeable contrast to the difference above noted respecting a matter\r\nof common concern, where nothing is sought except such a mutually\r\nsatisfactory outcome as the true merits of the case require, is the\r\nrecent resolution of the French Chambers favoring the conclusion of a\r\npermanent treaty of arbitration between the two countries.\r\n\r\nAn invitation has been extended by France to the Government and people\r\nof the United States to participate in a great international exposition\r\nat Paris in 1900 as a suitable commemoration of the close of this the\r\nworld's marvelous century of progress. I heartily recommend its\r\nacceptance, together with such legislation as will adequately provide\r\nfor a due representation of this Government and its people on the\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nOur relations with the States of the German Empire are in some aspects\r\ntypical of a condition of things elsewhere found in countries whose\r\nproductions and trade are similar to our own. The close rivalries of\r\ncompeting industries; the influence of the delusive doctrine that the\r\ninternal development of a nation is promoted and its wealth increased\r\nby a policy which, in undertaking to reserve its home markets for the\r\nexclusive use of its own producers, necessarily obstructs their sales\r\nin foreign markets and prevents free access to the products of the\r\nworld; the desire to retain trade in time-worn ruts, regardless of the\r\ninexorable laws of new needs and changed conditions of demand and\r\nsupply, and our own halting tardiness in inviting a freer exchange of\r\ncommodities, and by this means imperiling our footing in the external\r\nmarkets naturally open to us, have created a situation somewhat\r\ninjurious to American export interests, not only in Germany, where they\r\nare perhaps most noticeable, but in adjacent countries. The exports\r\naffected are largely American cattle and other food products, the\r\nreason assigned for unfavorable discrimination being that their\r\nconsumption is deleterious to the public health. This is all the more\r\nirritating in view of the fact that no European state is as jealous of\r\nthe excellence and wholesomeness of its exported food supplies as the\r\nUnited States, nor so easily able, on account of inherent soundness, to\r\nguarantee those qualities.\r\n\r\nNor are these difficulties confined to our food products designed for\r\nexportation. Our great insurance companies, for example, having built\r\nup a vast business abroad and invested a large share of their gains in\r\nforeign countries in compliance with the local laws and regulations\r\nthen existing, now find themselves within a narrowing circle of onerous\r\nand unforeseen conditions, and are confronted by the necessity of\r\nretirement from a field thus made unprofitable, if, indeed, they are\r\nnot summarily expelled, as some of them have lately been from Prussia.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be forgotten that international trade can not be\r\none-sided. Its currents are alternating, and its movements should be\r\nhonestly reciprocal. Without this it almost necessarily degenerates\r\ninto a device to gain advantage or a contrivance to secure benefits\r\nwith only the semblance of a return. In our dealings with other nations\r\nwe ought to be open-handed and scrupulously fair. This should be our\r\npolicy as a producing nation, and it plainly becomes us as a people who\r\nlove generosity and the moral aspects of national good faith and\r\nreciprocal forbearance.\r\n\r\nThese considerations should not, however, constrain us to submit to\r\nunfair discrimination nor to silently acquiesce in vexatious hindrances\r\nto the enjoyment of our share of the legitimate advantages of proper\r\ntrade relations. If an examination of the situation suggests such\r\nmeasures on our part as would involve restrictions similar to those\r\nfrom which we suffer, the way to such a course is easy. It should,\r\nhowever, by no means be lightly entered upon, since the necessity for\r\nthe inauguration of such a policy would be regretted by the best\r\nsentiment of our people and because it naturally and logically might\r\nlead to consequences of the gravest character.\r\n\r\nI take pleasure in calling to your attention the encomiums bestowed on\r\nthose vessels of our new Navy which took part in the notable ceremony\r\nof the opening of the Kiel Canal. It was fitting that this\r\nextraordinary achievement of the newer German nationality should be\r\ncelebrated in the presence of America's exposition of the latest\r\ndevelopments of the world' s naval energy.\r\n\r\nOur relations with Great Britain, always intimate and important, have\r\ndemanded during the past year even a greater share of consideration\r\nthan is usual.\r\n\r\nSeveral vexatious questions were left undetermined by the decision of\r\nthe Bering Sea Arbitration Tribunal. The application of the principles\r\nlaid down by that august body has not been followed by the results they\r\nwere intended to accomplish, either because the principles themselves\r\nlacked in breadth and definiteness or because their execution has been\r\nmore or less imperfect. Much correspondence has been exchanged between\r\nthe two Governments on the subject of preventing the exterminating\r\nslaughter of seals. The insufficiency of the British patrol of Bering\r\nSea under the regulations agreed on by the two Governments has been\r\npointed out, and yet only two British ships have been on police duty\r\nduring this season in those waters.\r\n\r\nThe need of a more effective enforcement of existing regulations as\r\nwell as the adoption of such additional regulations as experience has\r\nshown to be absolutely necessary to carry out the intent of the award\r\nhave been earnestly urged upon the British Government, but thus far\r\nwithout effective results. In the meantime the depletion of the seal\r\nherds by means of pelagic hunting has so alarmingly progressed that\r\nunless their slaughter is at once effectively checked their extinction\r\nwithin a few years seems to be a matter of absolute certainty.\r\n\r\nThe understanding by which the United States was to pay and Great\r\nBritain to receive a lump sum of $425,000 in full settlement of all\r\nBritish claims for damages arising from our seizure of British sealing\r\nvessels unauthorized under the award of the Paris Tribunal of\r\nArbitration was not confirmed by the last Congress, which declined to\r\nmake the necessary appropriation. I am still of the opinion that this\r\narrangement was a judicious and advantageous one for the Government,\r\nand I earnestly recommend that it be again considered and sanctioned.\r\nIf, however, this does not meet with the favor of Congress, it\r\ncertainly will hardly dissent from the proposition that the Government\r\nis bound by every consideration of honor and good faith to provide for\r\nthe speedy adjustment of these claims by arbitration as the only other\r\nalternative. A treaty of arbitration has therefore been agreed upon,\r\nand will be immediately laid before the Senate, so that in one of the\r\nmodes suggested a final settlement may be reached.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding that Great Britain originated the proposal to enforce\r\ninternational rules for the prevention of collisions at sea, based on\r\nthe recommendations of the Maritime Conference of Washington, and\r\nconcurred in, suggesting March 11, 1895, as the date to be set by\r\nproclamation for carrying these rules into general effect, Her\r\nMajesty's Government, having encountered opposition on the part of\r\nBritish shipping interests, announced its inability to accept that\r\ndate, which was consequently canceled. The entire matter is still in\r\nabeyance, without prospect of a better condition in the near future.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners appointed to mark the international boundary in\r\nPassamaquoddy Bay according to the description of the treaty of Ghent\r\nhave not yet fully agreed.\r\n\r\nThe completion of the preliminary survey of that Alaskan boundary which\r\nfollows the contour of the coast from the southernmost point of Prince\r\nof Wales Island until it strikes the one hundred and forty-first\r\nmeridian at or near the summit of Mount St. Elias awaits further\r\nnecessary appropriation, which is urgently recommended. This survey was\r\nundertaken under the provisions of the convention entered into by this\r\ncountry and Great Britain July 22, 1892, and the supplementary\r\nconvention of February 3, 1894.\r\n\r\nAs to the remaining section of the Alaskan boundary, which follows the\r\none hundred and forty-first meridian northwardly from Mount St. Elias\r\nto the Frozen Ocean, the settlement of which involves the physical\r\nlocation of the meridian mentioned, no conventional agreement has yet\r\nbeen made. The ascertainment of a given meridian at a particular point\r\nis a work requiring much time and careful observations and surveys.\r\nSuch observations and surveys were undertaken by the United States\r\nCoast and Geodetic Survey in 1890 and 1891, while similar work in the\r\nsame quarters, under British auspices, is believed to give nearly\r\ncoincident results; but these surveys have been independently\r\nconducted, and no international agreement to mark those or any other\r\nparts of the one hundred and forty-first meridian by permanent\r\nmonuments has yet been made. In the meantime the valley of the Yukon is\r\nbecoming a highway through the hitherto unexplored wilds of Alaska, and\r\nabundant mineral wealth has been discovered in that region, especially\r\nat or near the junction of the boundary meridian with the Yukon and its\r\ntributaries. In these circumstances it is expedient, and, indeed,\r\nimperative, that the jurisdictional limits of the respective\r\nGovernments in this new region be speedily determined. Her Britannic\r\nMajesty's Government has proposed a joint delimitation of the one\r\nhundred and forty-first meridian by an international commission of\r\nexperts, which, if Congress will authorize it and make due provision\r\ntherefor, can be accomplished with no unreasonable delay. It is\r\nimpossible to overlook the vital importance of continuing the work\r\nalready entered upon and supplementing it by further effective measures\r\nlooking to the exact location of this entire boundary line.\r\n\r\nI call attention to the unsatisfactory delimitation of the respective\r\njurisdictions of the United States and the Dominion of Canada in the\r\nGreat Lakes at the approaches to the narrow waters that connect them.\r\nThe waters in question are frequented by fishermen of both\r\nnationalities and their nets are there used. Owing to the uncertainty\r\nand ignorance as to the true boundary, vexations disputes and injurious\r\nseizures of boats and nets by Canadian cruisers often occur, while any\r\npositive settlement thereof by an accepted standard is not easily to be\r\nreached. A joint commission to determine the line in those quarters on\r\na practical basis, by measured courses following range marks on shore,\r\nis a necessity for which immediate provision should be made.\r\n\r\nIt being apparent that the boundary dispute between Great Britain and\r\nthe Republic of Venezuela concerning the limits of British Guiana was\r\napproaching an acute stage, a definite statement of the interest and\r\npolicy of the United States as regards the controversy seemed to be\r\nrequired both on its own account and in view of its relations with the\r\nfriendly powers directly concerned. In July last, therefore, a dispatch\r\nwas addressed to our ambassador at London for communication to the\r\nBritish Government in which the attitude of the United States was fully\r\nand distinctly set forth. The general conclusions therein reached and\r\nformulated are in substance that the traditional and established policy\r\nof this Government is firmly opposed to a forcible increase by any\r\nEuropean power of its territorial possessions on this continent; that\r\nthis policy is as well rounded in principle as it is strongly supported\r\nby numerous precedents; that as a consequence the United States is\r\nbound to protest against the enlargement of the area of British Guiana\r\nin derogation of the rights and against the will of Venezuela; that\r\nconsidering the disparity in strength of Great Britain and Venezuela\r\nthe territorial dispute between them can be reasonably settled only by\r\nfriendly and impartial arbitration, and that the resort to such\r\narbitration should include the whole controversy, and is not satisfied\r\nif one of the powers concerned is permitted to draw an arbitrary line\r\nthrough the territory in debate and to declare that it will submit to\r\narbitration only the portion lying on one side of it. In view of these\r\nconclusions, the dispatch in question called upon the British\r\nGovernment for a definite answer to the question whether it would or\r\nwould not submit the territorial controversy between itself and\r\nVenezuela in its entirety to impartial arbitration. The answer of the\r\nBritish Government has not yet been received, but is expected shortly,\r\nwhen further communication on the subject will probably be made to the\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nEarly in January last an uprising against the Government of Hawaii was\r\npromptly suppressed. Martial law was forthwith proclaimed and numerous\r\narrests were made of persons suspected of being in sympathy with the\r\nRoyalist party. Among these were several citizens of the United States,\r\nwho were either convicted by a military court and sentenced to death,\r\nimprisonment, or fine or were deported without trial. The United\r\nStates, while denying protection to such as had taken the Hawaiian oath\r\nof allegiance, insisted that martial law, though altering the forms of\r\njustice, could not supersede justice itself, and demanded stay of\r\nexecution until the proceedings had been submitted to this Government\r\nand knowledge obtained therefrom that our citizens had received fair\r\ntrial. The death sentences were subsequently commuted or were remitted\r\non condition of leaving the islands. The cases of certain Americans\r\narrested and expelled by arbitrary order without formal charge or trial\r\nhave had attention, and in some instances have been found to justify\r\nremonstrance and a claim for indemnity, which Hawaii has not thus far\r\nconceded.\r\n\r\nMr. Thurston, the Hawaiian minister, having furnished this Government\r\nabundant reason for asking that he be recalled, that course was\r\npursued, and his successor has lately been received.\r\n\r\nThe deplorable lynching of several Italian laborers in Colorado was\r\nnaturally followed by international representations, and I am happy to\r\nsay that the best efforts of the State in which the outrages occurred\r\nhave been put forth to discover and punish the authors of this\r\natrocious crime. The dependent families of some of the unfortunate\r\nvictims invite by their deplorable condition gracious provision for\r\ntheir needs.\r\n\r\nThese manifestations against helpless aliens may be traced through\r\nsuccessive stages to the vicious padroni system, which, unchecked by\r\nour immigration and contract-labor statutes, controls these workers\r\nfrom the moment of landing on our shores and farms them out in distant\r\nand often rude regions, where their cheapening competition in the\r\nfields of bread-winning toil brings them into collision with other\r\nlabor interests. While welcoming, as we should, those who seek our\r\nshores to merge themselves in our body politic and win personal\r\ncompetence by honest effort, we can not regard such assemblages of\r\ndistinctively alien laborers, hired out in the mass to the profit of\r\nalien speculators and shipped hither and thither as the prospect of\r\ngain may dictate, as otherwise than repugnant to the spirit of our\r\ncivilization, deterrent to individual advancement, and hindrances to\r\nthe building up of stable communities resting upon the wholesome\r\nambitions of the citizen and constituting the prime factor in the\r\nprosperity and progress of our nation. If legislation can reach this\r\ngrowing evil, it certainly should be attempted.\r\n\r\nJapan has furnished abundant evidence of her vast gain in every trait\r\nand characteristic that constitutes a nation's greatness. We have\r\nreason for congratulation in the fact that the Government of the United\r\nStates, by the exchange of liberal treaty stipulations with the new\r\nJapan, was the first to recognize her wonderful advance and to extend\r\nto her the consideration and confidence due to her national\r\nenlightenment and progressive character.\r\n\r\nThe boundary dispute which lately threatened to embroil Guatemala and\r\nMexico has happily yielded to pacific counsels, and its determination\r\nhas, by the joint agreement of the parties, been submitted to the sole\r\narbitration of the United States minister to Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe commission appointed under the convention of February 18, 1889, to\r\nset new monuments along the boundary between the United States and\r\nMexico has completed its task.\r\n\r\nAs a sequel to the failure of a scheme for the colonization in Mexico\r\nof negroes, mostly immigrants from Alabama under contract, a great\r\nnumber of these helpless and suffering people, starving and smitten\r\nwith contagious disease, made their way or were assisted to the\r\nfrontier, where, in wretched plight, they were quarantined by the Texas\r\nauthorities. Learning of their destitute condition, I directed rations\r\nto be temporarily furnished them through the War Department. At the\r\nexpiration of their quarantine they were conveyed by the railway\r\ncompanies at comparatively nominal rates to their homes in Alabama,\r\nupon my assurance, in the absence of any fund available for the cost of\r\ntheir transportation, that I would recommend to Congress an\r\nappropriation for its payment. I now strongly urge upon Congress the\r\npropriety of making such an appropriation. It should be remembered that\r\nthe measures taken were dictated not only by sympathy and humanity, but\r\nby a conviction that it was not compatible with the dignity of this\r\nGovernment that so large a body of our dependent citizens should be\r\nthrown for relief upon the charity of a neighboring state.\r\n\r\nIn last year's message I narrated at some length the jurisdictional\r\nquestions then freshly arisen in the Mosquito Indian Strip of\r\nNicaragua. Since that time, by the voluntary act of the Mosquito\r\nNation, the territory reserved to them has been incorporated with\r\nNicaragua, the Indians formally subjecting themselves to be governed by\r\nthe general laws and regulations of the Republic instead of by their\r\nown customs and regulations, and thus availing themselves of a\r\nprivilege secured to them by the treaty between Nicaragua and Great\r\nBritain of January 28, 1860.\r\n\r\nAfter this extension of uniform Nicaraguan administration to the\r\nMosquito Strip, the case of the British vice-consul, Hatch, and of\r\nseveral of his countrymen who had been summarily expelled from\r\nNicaragua and treated with considerable indignity provoked a claim by\r\nGreat Britain upon Nicaragua for pecuniary indemnity, which, upon\r\nNicaragua's refusal to admit liability, was enforced by Great Britain.\r\nWhile the sovereignty and jurisdiction of Nicaragua was in no way\r\nquestioned by Great Britain, the former's arbitrary conduct in regard\r\nto British subjects furnished the ground for this proceeding.\r\n\r\nA British naval force occupied without resistance the Pacific seaport\r\nof Corinto, but was soon after withdrawn upon the promise that the sum\r\ndemanded would be paid. Throughout this incident the kindly offices of\r\nthe United States were invoked and were employed in favor of as\r\npeaceful a settlement and as much consideration and indulgence toward\r\nNicaragua as were consistent with the nature of the case. Our efforts\r\nhave since been made the subject of appreciative and grateful\r\nrecognition by Nicaragua. The coronation of the Czar of Russia at\r\nMoscow in May next invites the ceremonial participation of the United\r\nStates, and in accordance with usage and diplomatic propriety our\r\nminister to the imperial court has been directed to represent our\r\nGovernment on the occasion.\r\n\r\nCorrespondence is on foot touching the practice of Russian consuls\r\nwithin the jurisdiction of the United States to interrogate citizens as\r\nto their race and religious faith, and upon ascertainment thereof to\r\ndeny to Jews authentication of passports or legal documents for use in\r\nRussia. Inasmuch as such a proceeding imposes a disability which in the\r\ncase of succession to property in Russia may be found to infringe the\r\ntreaty rights of our citizens, and which is an obnoxious invasion of\r\nour territorial jurisdiction, it has elicited fitting remonstrance, the\r\nresult of which, it is hoped, will remove the cause of complaint. The\r\npending claims of sealing vessels of the United States seized in\r\nRussian waters remain unadjusted. Our recent convention with Russia\r\nestablishing a modus vivendi as to imperial jurisdiction in such cases\r\nhas prevented further difficulty of this nature.\r\n\r\nThe Russian Government has welcomed in principle our suggestion for a\r\nmodus vivendi, to embrace Great Britain and Japan, looking to the\r\nbetter preservation of seal life in the North Pacific and Bering Sea\r\nand the extension of the protected area defined by the Paris Tribunal\r\nto all Pacific waters north of the thirty-fifth parallel. It is\r\nespecially noticeable that Russia favors prohibition of the use of\r\nfirearms in seal hunting throughout the proposed area and a longer\r\nclosed season for pelagic sealing.\r\n\r\nIn my last two annual messages I called the attention of the Congress\r\nto the position we occupied as one of the parties to a treaty or\r\nagreement by which we became jointly bound with England and Germany to\r\nso interfere with the government and control of Samoa as in effect to\r\nassume the management of its affairs. On the 9th day of May, 1894, I\r\ntransmitted to the Senate a special message, with accompanying\r\ndocuments, giving information on the subject and emphasizing the\r\nopinion I have at all times entertained, that our situation in this\r\nmatter was inconsistent with the mission and traditions of our\r\nGovernment, in violation of the principles we profess, and in all its\r\nphases mischievous and vexatious.\r\n\r\nI again press this subject upon the attention of the Congress and ask\r\nfor such legislative action or expression as will lead the way to our\r\nrelief from obligations both irksome and unnatural.\r\n\r\nCuba is again gravely disturbed. An insurrection in some respects more\r\nactive than the last preceding revolt, which continued from 1868 to\r\n1878, now exists in a large part of the eastern interior of the island,\r\nmenacing even some populations on the coast. Besides deranging the\r\ncommercial exchanges of the island, of which our country takes the\r\npredominant share, this flagrant condition of hostilities, by arousing\r\nsentimental sympathy and inciting adventurous support among our people,\r\nhas entailed earnest effort on the part of this Government to enforce\r\nobedience to our neutrality laws and to prevent the territory of the\r\nUnited States from being abused as a vantage ground from which to aid\r\nthose in arms against Spanish sovereignty.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the traditional sympathy of our countrymen as\r\nindividuals with a people who seem to be struggling for larger autonomy\r\nand greater freedom, deepened, as such sympathy naturally must be, in\r\nbehalf of our neighbors, yet the plain duty of their Government is to\r\nobserve in good faith the recognized obligations of international\r\nrelationship. The performance of this duty should not be made more\r\ndifficult by a disregard on the part of our citizens of the obligations\r\ngrowing out of their allegiance to their country, which should restrain\r\nthem from violating as individuals the neutrality which the nation of\r\nwhich they are members is bound to observe in its relations to friendly\r\nsovereign states. Though neither the warmth of our people's sympathy\r\nwith the Cuban insurgents, nor our loss and material damage consequent\r\nupon the futile endeavors thus far made to restore peace and order, nor\r\nany shock our humane sensibilities may have received from the cruelties\r\nwhich appear to especially characterize this sanguinary and fiercely\r\nconducted war, have in the least shaken the determination of the\r\nGovernment to honestly fulfill every international obligation, yet it\r\nis to be earnestly hoped on every ground that the devastation of armed\r\nconflict may speedily be stayed and order and quiet restored to the\r\ndistracted island, bringing in their train the activity and thrift of\r\npeaceful pursuits.\r\n\r\nOne notable instance of interference by Spain with passing American\r\nships has occurred. On March 8 last the Allianca, while bound from\r\nColon to New York, and following the customary track for vessels near\r\nthe Cuban shore, but outside the 3-mile limit, was fired upon by a\r\nSpanish gunboat. Protest was promptly made by the United States against\r\nthis act as not being justified by a state of war, nor permissible in\r\nrespect of vessels on the usual paths of commerce, nor tolerable in\r\nview of the wanton peril occasioned to innocent life and property. The\r\nact was disavowed, with full expression of regret and assurance of\r\nnonrecurrence of such just cause of complaint, while the offending\r\nofficer was relieved of his command. Military arrests of citizens of\r\nthe United States in Cuba have occasioned frequent reclamations. Where\r\nheld on criminal charges their delivery to the ordinary civil\r\njurisdiction for trial has been demanded and obtained in conformity\r\nwith treaty provisions, and where merely detained by way of military\r\nprecaution under a proclaimed state of siege, without formulated\r\naccusation, their release or trial has been insisted upon. The right of\r\nAmerican consular officers in the island to prefer protests and demands\r\nin such cases having been questioned by the insular authority, their\r\nenjoyment of the privilege stipulated by treaty for the consuls of\r\nGermany was claimed under the most-favored-nation provision of our own\r\nconvention and was promptly recognized.\r\n\r\nThe long-standing demand of Antonio Maximo Mora against Spain has at\r\nlast been settled by the payment, on the 14th of September last, of the\r\nsum originally agreed upon in liquidation of the claim. Its\r\ndistribution among the parties entitled to receive it has proceeded as\r\nrapidly as the rights of those claiming the fund could be safely\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\nThe enforcement of differential duties against products of this country\r\nexported to Cuba and Puerto Rico prompted the immediate claim on our\r\npart to the benefit of the minimum tariff of Spain in return for the\r\nmost favorable treatment permitted by our laws as regards the\r\nproduction of Spanish territories. A commercial arrangement was\r\nconcluded in January last securing the treatment so claimed.\r\n\r\nVigorous protests against excessive fines imposed on our ships and\r\nmerchandise by the customs officers of these islands for trivial errors\r\nhave resulted in the remission of such fines in instances where the\r\nequity of the complaint was apparent, though the vexatious practice has\r\nnot been wholly discontinued.\r\n\r\nOccurrences in Turkey have continued to excite concern. The reported\r\nmassacres of Christians in Armenia and the development there and in\r\nother districts of a spirit of fanatic hostility to Christian\r\ninfluences naturally excited apprehension for the safety of the devoted\r\nmen and women who, as dependents of the foreign missionary societies in\r\nthe United States, reside in Turkey under the guaranty of law and usage\r\nand in the legitimate performance of their educational and religious\r\nmission. No efforts have been spared in their behalf, and their\r\nprotection in person and property has been earnestly and vigorously\r\nenforced by every means within our power.\r\n\r\nI regret, however, that an attempt on our part to obtain better\r\ninformation concerning the true condition of affairs in the disturbed\r\nquarter of the Ottoman Empire by sending thither the United States\r\nconsul at Sivas to make investigation and report was thwarted by the\r\nobjections of the Turkish Government. This movement on our part was in\r\nno sense meant as a gratuitous entanglement of the United States in the\r\nso-called Eastern question nor as an officious interference with the\r\nright and duty which belong by treaty to certain great European powers\r\ncalling for their intervention in political matters affecting the good\r\ngovernment and religious freedom of the non-Mussulman subjects of the\r\nSultan, but it arose solely from our desire to have an accurate\r\nknowledge of the conditions in our efforts to care for those entitled\r\nto our protection.\r\n\r\nThe presence of our naval vessels which are now in the vicinity of the\r\ndisturbed localities affords opportunities to acquire a measure of\r\nfamiliarity with the condition of affairs and will enable us to take\r\nsuitable steps for the protection of any interests of our countrymen\r\nwithin reach of our ships that might be found imperiled.\r\n\r\nThe Ottoman Government has lately issued an imperial irade exempting\r\nforever from taxation an American college for girls at Scutari.\r\nRepeated assurances have also been obtained by our envoy at\r\nConstantinople that similar institutions maintained and administered by\r\nour countrymen shall be secured in the enjoyment of all rights and that\r\nour citizens throughout the Empire shall be protected.\r\n\r\nThe Government, however, in view of existing facts, is far from relying\r\nupon such assurances as the limit of its duty. Our minister has been\r\nvigilant and alert in affording all possible protection in individual\r\ncases where danger threatened or safety was imperiled. We have sent\r\nships as far toward the points of actual disturbance as it is possible\r\nfor them to go, where they offer refuge to those obliged to flee, and\r\nwe have the promise of other powers which have ships in the\r\nneighborhood that our citizens as well as theirs will be received and\r\nprotected on board those ships. On the demand of our minister orders\r\nhave been issued by the Sultan that Turkish soldiers shall guard and\r\nescort to the coast American refugees.\r\n\r\nThese orders have been carried out, and our latest intelligence gives\r\nassurance of the present personal safety of our citizens and\r\nmissionaries. Though thus far no lives of American citizens have been\r\nsacrificed, there can be no doubt that serious loss and destruction of\r\nmission property have resulted from riotous conflicts and outrageous\r\nattacks.\r\n\r\nBy treaty several of the most powerful European powers have secured a\r\nright and have assumed a duty not only in behalf of their own citizens\r\nand in furtherance of their own interests, but as agents of the\r\nChristian world. Their right is to enforce such conduct of Turkish\r\ngovernment as will restrain fanatical brutality, and if this fails\r\ntheir duty is to so interfere as to insure against such dreadful\r\noccurrences in Turkey as have lately shocked civilization. The powers\r\ndeclare this right and this duty to be theirs alone, and it is\r\nearnestly hoped that prompt and effective action on their part will not\r\nbe delayed.\r\n\r\nThe new consulates at Erzerum and Harpoot, for which appropriation was\r\nmade last session, have been provisionally filled by trusted employees\r\nof the Department of State. These appointees, though now in Turkey,\r\nhave not yet received their exequaturs.\r\n\r\nThe arbitration of the claim of the Venezuela Steam Transportation\r\nCompany under the treaty of January 19, 1892, between the United States\r\nand Venezuela, resulted in an award in favor of the claimant.\r\n\r\nThe Government has used its good offices toward composing the\r\ndifferences between Venezuela on the one hand and France and Belgium on\r\nthe other growing out of the dismissal of the representatives of those\r\npowers on the ground of a publication deemed offensive to Venezuela.\r\nAlthough that dismissal was coupled with a cordial request that other\r\nmore personally agreeable envoys be sent in their stead, a rupture of\r\nintercourse ensued and still continues.\r\n\r\nIn view of the growth of our interests in foreign countries and the\r\nencouraging prospects for a general expansion of our commerce, the\r\nquestion of an improvement in the consular service has increased in\r\nimportance and urgency. Though there is no doubt that the great body of\r\nconsular officers are rendering valuable services to the trade and\r\nindustries of the country, the need of some plan of appointment and\r\ncontrol which would tend to secure a higher average of efficiency can\r\nnot be denied.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the subject has led the Executive to consider what\r\nsteps might properly be taken without additional legislation to answer\r\nthe need of a better system of consular appointments. The matter having\r\nbeen committed to the consideration of the Secretary of State, in\r\npursuance of his recommendations an Executive order was issued on the\r\n20th of September, 1895, by the terms of which it is provided that\r\nafter that date any vacancy in a consulate or commercial agency with an\r\nannual salary or compensation from official fees of not more than\r\n$2,500 or less than $1,000 should be filled either by transfer or\r\npromotion from some other position under the Department of State of a\r\ncharacter tending to qualify the incumbent for the position to be\r\nfilled, or by the appointment of a person not under the Department of\r\nState, but having previously served thereunder and shown his capacity\r\nand fitness for consular duty, or by the appointment of a person who,\r\nhaving been selected by the President and sent to a board for\r\nexamination, is found upon such examination to be qualified for the\r\nposition. Posts which pay less than $1,000 being usually, on account of\r\ntheir small compensation, filled by selection from residents of the\r\nlocality, it was not deemed practicable to put them under the new\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nThe compensation of $2,500 was adopted as the maximum limit in the\r\nclassification for the reason that consular officers receiving more\r\nthan that sum are often charged with functions and duties scarcely\r\ninferior in dignity and importance to those of diplomatic agents, and\r\nit was therefore thought best to continue their selection in the\r\ndiscretion of the Executive without subjecting them to examination\r\nbefore a board. Excluding 71 places with compensation at present less\r\nthan $1,000 and 53 places above the maximum in compensation, the number\r\nof positions remaining within the scope of the order is 196. This\r\nnumber will undoubtedly be increased by the inclusion of consular\r\nofficers whose remuneration in fees, now less than $1,000, will be\r\naugmented with the growth of our foreign commerce and a return to more\r\nfavorable business conditions.\r\n\r\nIn execution of the Executive order referred to the Secretary of State\r\nhas designated as a board to conduct the prescribed examinations the\r\nThird Assistant Secretary of State, the Solicitor of the Department of\r\nState, and the Chief of the Consular Bureau, and has specified the\r\nsubjects to which such examinations shall relate.\r\n\r\nIt is not assumed that this system will prove a full measure of\r\nconsular reform. It is quite probable that actual experience will show\r\nparticulars in which the order already issued may be amended and\r\ndemonstrate that for the best results appropriate legislation by\r\nCongress is imperatively required.\r\n\r\nIn any event, these efforts to improve the consular service ought to be\r\nimmediately supplemented by legislation providing for consular\r\ninspection. This has frequently been a subject of Executive\r\nrecommendation, and I again urge such action by Congress as will permit\r\nthe frequent and thorough inspection of consulates by officers\r\nappointed for that purpose or by persons already in the diplomatic or\r\nconsular service. The expense attending such a plan would be\r\ninsignificant compared with its usefulness, and I hope the legislation\r\nnecessary to set it on foot will be speedily forthcoming.\r\n\r\nI am thoroughly convinced that in addition to their salaries our\r\nambassadors and ministers at foreign courts should be provided by the\r\nGovernment with official residences. The salaries of these officers are\r\ncomparatively small and in most cases insufficient to pay, with other\r\nnecessary expenses, the cost of maintaining household establishments in\r\nkeeping with their important and delicate functions. The usefulness of\r\na nation's diplomatic representative undeniably depends much upon the\r\nappropriateness of his surroundings, and a country like ours, while\r\navoiding unnecessary glitter and show, should be certain that it does\r\nnot suffer in its relations with foreign nations through parsimony and\r\nshabbiness in its diplomatic outfit. These considerations and the other\r\nadvantages of having fixed and somewhat permanent locations for our\r\nembassies would abundantly justify the moderate expenditure necessary\r\nto carry out this suggestion.\r\n\r\nAs we turn from a review of our foreign relations to the contemplation\r\nof our national financial situation we are immediately aware that we\r\napproach a subject of domestic concern more important than any other\r\nthat can engage our attention, and one at present in such a perplexing\r\nand delicate predicament as to require prompt and wise treatment.\r\n\r\nWe may well be encouraged to earnest effort in this direction when we\r\nrecall the steps already taken toward improving our economic and\r\nfinancial situation and when we appreciate how well the way has been\r\nprepared for further progress by an aroused and intelligent popular\r\ninterest in these subjects.\r\n\r\nBy command of the people a customs-revenue system designed for the\r\nprotection and benefit of favored classes at the expense of the great\r\nmass of our countrymen, and which, while inefficient for the purpose of\r\nrevenue, curtailed our trade relations and impeded our entrance to the\r\nmarkets of the world, has been superseded by a tariff policy which in\r\nprinciple is based upon a denial of the right of the Government to\r\nobstruct the avenues to our people's cheap living or lessen their\r\ncomfort and contentment for the sake of according especial advantages\r\nto favorites, and which, while encouraging our intercourse and trade\r\nwith other nations, recognizes the fact that American self-reliance,\r\nthrift, and ingenuity can build up our country's industries and develop\r\nits resources more surely than enervating paternalism.\r\n\r\nThe compulsory purchase and coinage of silver by the Government,\r\nunchecked and unregulated by business conditions and heedless of our\r\ncurrency needs, which for more than fifteen years diluted our\r\ncirculating medium, undermined confidence abroad in our financial\r\nability, and at last culminated in distress and panic at home, has been\r\nrecently stopped by the repeal of the laws which forced this reckless\r\nscheme upon the country.\r\n\r\nThe things thus accomplished, notwithstanding their extreme importance\r\nand beneficent effects, fall far short of curing the monetary evils\r\nfrom which we suffer as a result of long indulgence in ill-advised\r\nfinancial expedients.\r\n\r\nThe currency denominated United States notes and commonly known as\r\ngreenbacks was issued in large volume during the late Civil War and was\r\nintended originally to meet the exigencies of that period. It will be\r\nseen by a reference to the debates in Congress at the time the laws\r\nwere passed authorizing the issue of these notes that their advocates\r\ndeclared they were intended for only temporary use and to meet the\r\nemergency of war. In almost if not all the laws relating to them some\r\nprovision was made contemplating their voluntary or compulsory\r\nretirement. A large quantity of them, however, were kept on foot and\r\nmingled with the currency of the country, so that at the close of the\r\nyear 1874 they amounted to $381,999,073.\r\n\r\nImmediately after that date, and in January, 1875, a law was passed\r\nproviding for the resumption of specie payments, by which the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury was required whenever additional circulation was issued\r\nto national banks to retire United States notes equal in amount to 80\r\nper cent of such additional national-bank circulation until such notes\r\nwere reduced to $300,000,000. This law further provided that on and\r\nafter the 1st day of January, 1879, the United States notes then\r\noutstanding should be redeemed in coin, and in order to provide and\r\nprepare for such redemption the Secretary of the Treasury was\r\nauthorized not only to use any surplus revenues of the Government, but\r\nto issue bonds of the United States and dispose of them for coin and to\r\nuse the proceeds for the purposes contemplated by the statute.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1878, and before the date thus appointed for the redemption and\r\nretirement of these notes, another statute was passed forbidding their\r\nfurther cancellation and retirement. Some of them had, however, been\r\npreviously redeemed and canceled upon the issue of additional\r\nnational-bank circulation, as permitted by the law of 1875, so that the\r\namount outstanding at the time of the passage of the act forbidding\r\ntheir further retirement was $346,681,016.\r\n\r\nThe law of 1878 did not stop at distinct prohibition, but contained in\r\naddition the following express provision:\r\n\r\nAnd when any of said notes may be redeemed or be received into the\r\nTreasury under any law from any source whatever, and shall belong to\r\nthe United States, they shall not be retired, canceled, or destroyed,\r\nbut they shall be reissued and paid out again and kept in circulation.\r\n This was the condition of affairs on the 1st day of January, 1879, which had been fixed upon four years before as the date for entering upon the redemption and retirement of all these notes, and for which such abundant means had been provided.\r\nThe Government was put in the anomalous situation of owing to the\r\nholders of its notes debts payable in gold on demand which could\r\nneither be retired by receiving such notes in discharge of obligations\r\ndue the Government nor canceled by actual payment in gold. It was\r\nforced to redeem without redemption and to pay without acquittance.\r\n\r\nThere had been issued and sold $95,500,000 of the bonds authorized by\r\nthe resumption act of 1875, the proceeds of which, together with other\r\ngold in the Treasury, created a gold fund deemed sufficient to meet the\r\ndemands which might be made upon it for the redemption of the\r\noutstanding United States notes. This fund, together with such other\r\ngold as might be from time to time in the Treasury available for the\r\nsame purpose, has been since called our gold reserve, and $100,000,000\r\nhas been regarded as an adequate amount to accomplish its object. This\r\nfund amounted on the 1st day of January, 1879, to $114,193,360, and\r\nthough thereafter constantly fluctuating it did not fall below that sum\r\nuntil July, 1892. In April, 1893, for the first time since its\r\nestablishment, this reserve amounted to less than $100,000,000,\r\ncontaining at that date only $97,011,330.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, and in July, 1890, an act had been passed directing\r\nlarger governmental monthly purchases of silver than had been required\r\nunder previous laws, and providing that in payment for such silver\r\nTreasury notes of the United States should be issued payable on demand\r\nin gold or silver coin, at the discretion of the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury. It was, however, declared in the act to be\" the established\r\npolicy of the United States to maintain the two metals on a parity with\r\neach other upon the present legal ratio or such ratio as may be\r\nprovided by law.\" In view of this declaration it was not deemed\r\npermissible for the Secretary of the Treasury to exercise the\r\ndiscretion in terms conferred on him by refusing to pay gold on these\r\nnotes when demanded, because by such discrimination in favor of the\r\ngold dollar the so-called parity of the two metals would be destroyed\r\nand grave and dangerous consequences would be precipitated by affirming\r\nor accentuating the constantly widening disparity between their actual\r\nvalues under the existing ratio.\r\n\r\nIt thus resulted that the Treasury notes issued in payment of silver\r\npurchases under the law of 1890 were necessarily treated as gold\r\nobligations at the option of the holder. These notes on the 1st day of\r\nNovember, 1893, when the law compelling the monthly purchase of silver\r\nwas repealed, amounted to more than $155,000,000. The notes of this\r\ndescription now outstanding added to the United States notes still\r\nundiminished by redemption or cancellation constitute a volume of gold\r\nobligations amounting to nearly $500,000,000.\r\n\r\nThese obligations are the instruments which ever since we had a gold\r\nreserve have been used to deplete it.\r\n\r\nThis reserve, as has been stated, had fallen in April, 1893, to\r\n$97,111,330. It has from that time to the present, with very few and\r\nunimportant upward movements, steadily decreased, except as it has been\r\ntemporarily replenished by the sale of bonds.\r\n\r\nAmong the causes for this constant and uniform shrinkage in this fund\r\nmay be mentioned the great falling off of exports under the operation\r\nof the tariff law until recently in force, which crippled our exchange\r\nof commodities with foreign nations and necessitated to some extent the\r\npayment of our balances in gold; the unnatural infusion of silver into\r\nour currency and the increasing agitation for its free and unlimited\r\ncoinage, which have created apprehension as to our disposition or\r\nability to continue gold payments; the consequent hoarding of gold at\r\nhome and the stoppage of investments of foreign capital, as well as the\r\nreturn of our securities already sold abroad; and the high rate of\r\nforeign exchange, which induced the shipment of our gold to be drawn\r\nagainst as a matter of speculation.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of these conditions the gold reserve on the 1st day of\r\nFebruary, 1894, was reduced to $65,438,377, having lost more than\r\n$31,000,000 during the preceding nine months, or since April, 1893. Its\r\nreplenishment being necessary and no other manner of accomplishing it\r\nbeing possible, resort was had to the issue and sale of bonds provided\r\nfor by the resumption act of 1875. Fifty millions of these bonds were\r\nsold, yielding $58,633,295.71, which was added to the reserve fund of\r\ngold then on hand. As a result of this operation this reserve, which\r\nhad suffered constant and large withdrawals in the meantime, stood on\r\nthe 6th day of March, 1894, at the sum of $107,446,802. Its depletion\r\nwas, however, immediately thereafter so accelerated that on the 30th\r\nday of June, 1894, it had fallen to $64,873,025, thus losing by\r\nwithdrawals more than $42,000,000 in five months and dropping slightly\r\nbelow its situation when the sale of $50,000,000 in bonds was effected\r\nfor its replenishment.\r\n\r\nThis depressed condition grew worse, and on the 24th day of November,\r\n1894, our gold reserve being reduced to $57,669,701, it became\r\nnecessary to again strengthen it.\r\n\r\nThis was done by another sale of bonds amounting to $50,000,000, from\r\nwhich there was realized $58,538,500, with which the fund was increased\r\nto $111,142,021 on the 4th day of December, 1894.\r\n\r\nAgain disappointment awaited the anxious hope for relief. There was not\r\neven a lull in the exasperating withdrawals of gold. On the contrary,\r\nthey grew larger and more persistent than ever. Between the 4th day of\r\nDecember, 1894, and early in February, 1895, a period of scarcely more\r\nthan two months after the second reenforcement of our gold reserve by\r\nthe sale of bonds, it had lost by such withdrawals more than\r\n$69,000,000 and had fallen to $41,340,181. Nearly $43,000,000 had been\r\nwithdrawn within the month immediately preceding this situation.\r\n\r\nIn anticipation of impending trouble I had on the 28th day of January,\r\n1895, addressed a communication to the Congress fully setting forth our\r\ndifficulties and dangerous position and earnestly recommending that\r\nauthority be given the Secretary of the Treasury to issue bonds bearing\r\na low rate of interest, payable by their terms in gold, for the purpose\r\nof maintaining a sufficient gold reserve and also for the redemption\r\nand cancellation of outstanding United States notes and the Treasury\r\nnotes issued for the purchase of silver under the law of 1890. This\r\nrecommendation did not, however, meet with legislative approval.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1895, therefore, the situation was exceedingly critical.\r\nWith a reserve perilously low and a refusal of Congressional aid,\r\neverything indicated that the end of gold payments by the Government\r\nwas imminent. The results of prior bond issues had been exceedingly\r\nunsatisfactory, and the large withdrawals of gold immediately\r\nsucceeding their public sale in open market gave rise to a reasonable\r\nsuspicion that a large part of the gold paid into the Treasury upon\r\nsuch sales was promptly drawn out again by the presentation of United\r\nStates notes or Treasury notes, and found its way to the hands of those\r\nwho had only temporarily parted with it in the purchase of bonds.\r\n\r\nIn this emergency, and in view of its surrounding perplexities, it\r\nbecame entirely apparent to those upon whom the struggle for safety was\r\ndevolved not only that our gold reserve must, for the third time in\r\nless than thirteen months, be restored by another issue and sale of\r\nbonds bearing a high rate of interest and badly suited to the purpose,\r\nbut that a plan must be adopted for their disposition promising better\r\nresults than those realized on previous sales. An agreement was\r\ntherefore made with a number of financiers and bankers whereby it was\r\nstipulated that bonds described in the resumption act of 1875, payable\r\nin coin thirty years after their date, bearing interest at the rate of\r\n4 pet cent per annum, and amounting to about $62,000,000, should be\r\nexchanged for gold, receivable by weight, amounting to a little more\r\nthan $65,000,000.\r\n\r\nThis gold was to be delivered in such installments as would complete\r\nits delivery within about six months from the date of the contract, and\r\nat least one-half of the amount was to be furnished from abroad. It was\r\nalso agreed by those supplying this gold that during the continuance of\r\nthe contract they would by every means in their power protect the\r\nGovernment against gold withdrawals. The contract also provided that if\r\nCongress would authorize their issue bonds payable by their terms in\r\ngold and bearing interest at the rate of 3 per cent per annum might\r\nwithin ten days be substituted at par for the 4 per cent bonds\r\ndescribed in the agreement.\r\n\r\nOn the day this contract was made its terms were communicated to\r\nCongress by a special Executive message, in which it was stated that\r\nmore than $16,000,000 would be saved to the Government if gold bonds\r\nbearing 3 per cent interest were authorized to be substituted for those\r\nmentioned in the contract.\r\n\r\nThe Congress having declined to grant the necessary authority to secure\r\nthis saving, the contract, unmodified, was carried out, resulting in a\r\ngold reserve amounting to $107,571,230 on the 8th day of July, 1895.\r\nThe performance of this contract not only restored the reserve, but\r\nchecked for a time the withdrawals of gold and brought on a period of\r\nrestored confidence and such peace and quiet in business circles as\r\nwere of the greatest possible value to every interest that affects our\r\npeople. I have never had the slightest misgiving concerning the wisdom\r\nor propriety of this arrangement, and am quite willing to answer for my\r\nfull share of responsibility for its promotion. I believe it averted a\r\ndisaster the imminence of which was, fortunately, not at the time\r\ngenerally understood by our people.\r\n\r\nThough the contract mentioned stayed for a time the tide of gold\r\nwithdrawal, its good results could not be permanent. Recent withdrawals\r\nhave reduced the reserve from $107,571,230 on the 8th day of July,\r\n1895, to $79,333,966. How long it will remain large enough to render\r\nits increase unnecessary is only matter of conjecture, though quite\r\nlarge withdrawals for shipment in the immediate future are predicted in\r\nwell-informed quarters. About $16,000,000 has been withdrawn during the\r\nmonth of November.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing statement of events and conditions develops the fact that\r\nafter increasing our interest-bearing bonded indebtedness more than\r\n$162,000,000 to save our gold reserve we are nearly where we started,\r\nhaving now in such reserve $79,333,966, as against $65,438,377 in\r\nFebruary, 1894, when the first bonds were issued.\r\n\r\nThough the amount of gold drawn from the Treasury appears to be very\r\nlarge as gathered from the facts and figures herein presented, it\r\nactually was much larger, considerable sums having been acquired by the\r\nTreasury within the several periods stated without the issue of bonds.\r\nOn the 28th of January, 1895, it was reported by the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury that more than $172,000,000 of gold had been withdrawn for\r\nhoarding or shipment during the year preceding. He now reports that\r\nfrom January 1, 1879, to July 14, 1890, a period of more than eleven\r\nyears, only a little over $28,000,000 was withdrawn, and that between\r\nJuly 14, 1890, the date of the passage of the law for an increased\r\npurchase of silver, and the 1st day of December, 1895, or within less\r\nthan five and a half years, there was withdrawn nearly $375,000,000,\r\nmaking a total of more than $403,000,000 drawn from the Treasury in\r\ngold since January 1, 1879, the date fixed in 1875 for the retirement\r\nof the United States notes.\r\n\r\nNearly $327,000,000 of the gold thus withdrawn has been paid out on\r\nthese United States notes, and yet every one of the $346,000,000 is\r\nstill uncanceled and ready to do service in future gold depletions.\r\n\r\nMore than $76,000,000 in gold has since their creation in 1890 been\r\npaid out from the Treasury upon the notes given on the purchase of\r\nsilver by the Government, and yet the whole, amounting to $155,000,000,\r\nexcept a little more than $16,000,000 which has been retired by\r\nexchanges for silver at the request of the holders, remains outstanding\r\nand prepared to join their older and more experienced allies in future\r\nraids upon the Treasury's gold reserve.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the Government has paid in gold more than nine-tenths\r\nof its United States notes and still owes them all. It has paid in gold\r\nabout one-half of its notes given for silver purchases without\r\nextinguishing by such payment one dollar of these notes.\r\n\r\nWhen, added to all this, we are reminded that to carry on this astound,\r\nlug financial scheme the Government has incurred a bonded indebtedness\r\nof $95,500,000 in establishing a gold reserve and of $162,315,400 in\r\nefforts to maintain it; that the annual interest charge on such bonded\r\nindebtedness is more than $11,000,000; that a continuance of our\r\npresent course may result in further bond issues, and that we have\r\nsuffered or are threatened with all this for the sake of supplying gold\r\nfor foreign shipment or facilitating its hoarding at home, a situation\r\nis exhibited which certainly ought to arrest attention and provoke\r\nimmediate legislative relief.\r\n\r\nI am convinced the only thorough and practicable remedy for our\r\ntroubles is found in the retirement and cancellation of our United\r\nStates notes, commonly called greenbacks, and the outstanding Treasury\r\nnotes issued by the Government in payment of silver purchases under the\r\nact of 1890.\r\n\r\nI believe this could be quite readily accomplished by the exchange of\r\nthese notes for United States bonds, of small as well as large\r\ndenominations, bearing a low rate of interest. They should be long-term\r\nbonds, thus increasing their desirability as investments, and because\r\ntheir payment could be well postponed to a period far removed from\r\npresent financial burdens and perplexities, when with increased\r\nprosperity and resources they would be more easily met.\r\n\r\nTo further insure the cancellation of these notes and also provide a\r\nway by which gold may be added to our currency in lieu of them, a\r\nfeature in the plan should be an authority given to the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury to dispose of the bonds abroad for gold if necessary to\r\ncomplete the contemplated redemption and cancellation, permitting him\r\nto use the proceeds of such bonds to take up and cancel any of the\r\nnotes that may be in the Treasury or that may be received by the\r\nGovernment on any account.\r\n\r\nThe increase of our bonded debt involved in this plan would be amply\r\ncompensated by renewed activity and enterprise in all business circles,\r\nthe restored confidence at home, the reinstated faith in our monetary\r\nstrength abroad, and the stimulation of every interest and industry\r\nthat would follow the cancellation of the gold-demand obligations now\r\nafflicting us. In any event, the bonds proposed would stand for the\r\nextinguishment of a troublesome indebtedness, while in the path we now\r\nfollow there lurks the menace of unending bonds, with our indebtedness\r\nstill undischarged and aggravated in every feature. The obligations\r\nnecessary to fund this indebtedness would not equal in amount those\r\nfrom which we have been relieved since 1884 by anticipation and payment\r\nbeyond the requirements of the sinking fund out of our surplus revenues.\r\n\r\nThe currency withdrawn by the retirement of the United States notes and\r\nTreasury notes, amounting to probably less than $486,000,000, might be\r\nsupplied by such gold as would be used on their retirement or by an\r\nincrease in the circulation of our national banks. Though the aggregate\r\ncapital of those now in existence amounts to more than $664,000,000,\r\ntheir outstanding circulation based on bond security amounts to only\r\nabout $190,000,000. They are authorized to issue notes amounting to 90\r\nper cent of the bonds deposited to secure their circulation, but in no\r\nevent beyond the amount of their capital stock, and they are obliged to\r\npay 1 per cent tax on the circulation they issue.\r\n\r\nI think they should be allowed to issue circulation equal to the par\r\nvalue of the bonds they deposit to secure it, and that the tax on their\r\ncirculation should be reduced to one-fourth of 1 per cent, which would\r\nundoubtedly meet all the expense the Government incurs on their\r\naccount. In addition they should be allowed to substitute or deposit in\r\nlieu of the bonds now required as security for their circulation those\r\nwhich would be issued for the purpose of retiring the United States\r\nnotes and Treasury notes.\r\n\r\nThe banks already existing, if they desired to avail themselves of the\r\nprovisions of law thus modified, could issue circulation, in addition\r\nto that already outstanding, amounting to $478,000,000, which would\r\nnearly or quite equal the currency proposed to be canceled. At any\r\nrate, I should confidently expect to see the existing national banks or\r\nothers to be organized avail themselves of the proposed encouragements\r\nto issue circulation and promptly fill any vacuum and supply every\r\ncurrency need.\r\n\r\nIt has always seemed to me that the provisions of law regarding the\r\ncapital of national banks, which operate as a limitation to their\r\nlocation, fail to make proper compensation for the suppression of State\r\nbanks, which came near to the people in all sections of the country and\r\nreadily furnished them with banking accommodations and facilities. Any\r\ninconvenience or embarrassment arising from these restrictions on the\r\nlocation of national banks might well be remedied by better adapting\r\nthe present system to the creation of banks in smaller communities or\r\nby permitting banks of large capital to establish branches in such\r\nlocalities as would serve the people, so regulated and restrained as to\r\nsecure their safe and conservative control and management.\r\n\r\nBut there might not be the necessity for such an addition to the\r\ncurrency by new issues of bank circulation as at first glance is\r\nindicated. If we should be relieved from maintaining a gold reserve\r\nunder conditions that constitute it the barometer of our solvency, and\r\nif our Treasury should no longer be the foolish purveyor of gold for\r\nnations abroad or for speculation and hoarding by our citizens at home,\r\nI should expect to see gold resume its natural and normal functions in\r\nthe business affairs of the country and cease to be an object\r\nattracting the timid watch of our people and exciting their sensitive\r\nimaginations.\r\n\r\nI do not overlook the fact that the cancellation of the Treasury notes\r\nissued under the silver-purchasing act of 1890 would leave the Treasury\r\nin the actual ownership of sufficient silver, including seigniorage, to\r\ncoin nearly $178,000,000 in standard dollars. It is worthy of\r\nconsideration whether this might not from time to time be converted\r\ninto dollars or fractional coin and slowly put into circulation, as in\r\nthe judgment of the Secretary of the Treasury the necessities of the\r\ncountry should require.\r\n\r\nWhatever is attempted should be entered upon fully appreciating the\r\nfact that by careless, easy descent we have reached a dangerous depth,\r\nand that our ascent will not be accomplished without laborious toil and\r\nstruggle. We shall be wise if we realize that we are financially ill\r\nand that our restoration to health may require heroic treatment and\r\nunpleasant remedies.\r\n\r\nIn the present stage of our difficulty it is not easy to understand how\r\nthe amount of our revenue receipts directly affects it. The important\r\nquestion is not the quantity of money received in revenue payments, but\r\nthe kind of money we maintain and our ability to continue in sound\r\nfinancial condition. We are considering the Government's holdings of\r\ngold as related to the soundness of our money and as affecting our\r\nnational credit and monetary strength.\r\n\r\nIf our gold reserve had never been impaired; if no bonds had ever been\r\nissued to replenish it; if there had been no fear and timidity\r\nconcerning our ability to continue gold payments; if any part of our\r\nrevenues were now paid in gold, and if we could look to our gold\r\nreceipts as a means of maintaining a safe reserve, the amount of our\r\nrevenues would be an influential factor in the problem. But,\r\nunfortunately, all the circumstances that might lend weight to this\r\nconsideration are entirely lacking.\r\n\r\nIn our present predicament no gold is received by the Government in\r\npayment of revenue charges, nor would there be if the revenues were\r\nincreased. The receipts of the Treasury, when not in silver\r\ncertificates, consist of United States notes and Treasury notes issued\r\nfor silver purchases. These forms of money are only useful to the\r\nGovernment in paying its current ordinary expenses, and its quantity in\r\nGovernment possession does not in the least contribute toward giving us\r\nthat kind of safe financial standing or condition which is built on\r\ngold alone.\r\n\r\nIf it is said that these notes if held by the Government can be used to\r\nobtain gold for our reserve, the answer is easy. The people draw gold\r\nfrom the Treasury on demand upon United States notes and Treasury\r\nnotes, but the proposition that the Treasury can on demand draw gold\r\nfrom the people upon them would be regarded in these days with wonder\r\nand amusement; and even if this could be done there is nothing to\r\nprevent those thus parting with their gold from regaining it the next\r\nday or the next hour by the presentation of the notes they received in\r\nexchange for it.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury might use such notes taken from a surplus\r\nrevenue to buy gold in the market. Of course he could not do this\r\nwithout paying a premium. Private holders of gold, unlike the\r\nGovernment, having no parity to maintain, would not be restrained from\r\nmaking the best bargain possible when they furnished gold to the\r\nTreasury; but the moment the Secretary of the Treasury bought gold on\r\nany terms above par he would establish a general and universal premium\r\nupon it, thus breaking down the parity between gold and silver, which\r\nthe Government is pledged to maintain, and opening the way to new and\r\nserious complications. In the meantime the premium would not remain\r\nstationary, and the absurd spectacle might be presented of a dealer\r\nselling gold to the Government and with United States notes or Treasury\r\nnotes in his hand immediately clamoring for its return and a resale at\r\na higher premium.\r\n\r\nIt may be claimed that a large revenue and redundant receipts might\r\nfavorably affect the situation under discussion by affording an\r\nopportunity of retaining these notes in the Treasury when received, and\r\nthus preventing their presentation for gold. Such retention to be\r\nuseful ought to be at least measurably permanent; and this is precisely\r\nwhat is prohibited, so far as United States notes are concerned, by the\r\nlaw of 1878, forbidding their further retirement. That statute in so\r\nmany words provides that these notes when received into the Treasury\r\nand belonging to the United States shall be \"paid out again and kept in\r\ncirculation.\"\r\n\r\nIt will, moreover, be readily seen that the Government could not refuse\r\nto pay out United States notes and Treasury notes in current\r\ntransactions when demanded, and insist on paying out silver alone, and\r\nstill maintain the parity between that metal and the currency\r\nrepresenting gold. Besides, the accumulation in the Treasury of\r\ncurrency of any kind exacted from the people through taxation is justly\r\nregarded as an evil, and it can not proceed far without vigorous\r\nprotest against an unjustifiable retention of money from the business\r\nof the country and a denunciation of a scheme of taxation which proves\r\nitself to be unjust when it takes from the earnings and income of the\r\ncitizen money so much in excess of the needs of Government support that\r\nlarge sums can be gathered and kept in the Treasury. Such a condition\r\nhas heretofore in times of surplus revenue led the Government to\r\nrestore currency to the people by the purchase of its unmatured bonds\r\nat a large premium and by a large increase of its deposits in national\r\nbanks, and we easily remember that the abuse of Treasury accumulation\r\nhas furnished a most persuasive argument in favor of legislation\r\nradically reducing our tariff taxation.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is supposed that sufficient revenue receipts would in a\r\nsentimental way improve the situation by inspiring confidence in our\r\nsolvency and allaying the fear of pecuniary exhaustion. And yet through\r\nall our struggles to maintain our gold reserve there never has been any\r\napprehension as to our ready ability to pay our way with such money as\r\nwe had, and the question whether or not our current receipts met our\r\ncurrent expenses has not entered into the estimate of our solvency. Of\r\ncourse the general state of our funds, exclusive of gold, was entirely\r\nimmaterial to the foreign creditor and investor. His debt could only be\r\npaid in gold, and his only concern was our ability to keep on hand that\r\nkind of money.\r\n\r\nOn July 1, 1892, more than a year and a half before the first bonds\r\nwere issued to replenish the gold reserve, there was a net balance in\r\nthe Treasury, exclusive of such reserve, of less than $13,000,000, but\r\nthe gold reserve amounted to more than $114,000,000, which was the\r\nquieting feature of the situation. It was when the stock of gold began\r\nrapidly to fall that fright supervened and our securities held abroad\r\nwere returned for sale and debts owed abroad were pressed for payment.\r\nIn the meantime extensive shipments of gold and other unfavorable\r\nindications caused restlessness and fright among our people at home.\r\nThereupon the general state of our funds, exclusive of gold, became\r\nalso immaterial to them, and they too drew gold from the Treasury for\r\nhoarding against all contingencies. This is plainly shown by the large\r\nincrease in the proportion of gold withdrawn which was retained by our\r\nown people as time and threatening incidents progressed. During the\r\nfiscal year ending June 30, 1894, nearly $85,000,000 in gold was\r\nwithdrawn from the Treasury and about $77,000,000 was sent abroad,\r\nwhile during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1895, over $117,000,000\r\nwas drawn out, of which only about $66,000,000 was shipped, leaving the\r\nlarge balance of such withdrawals to be accounted for by domestic\r\nhoarding.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the withdrawal of our gold has resulted largely from\r\nfright, there is nothing apparent that will prevent its continuance or\r\nrecurrence, with its natural consequences, except such a change in our\r\nfinancial methods as will reassure the frightened and make the desire\r\nfor gold less intense. It is not clear how an increase fix revenue,\r\nunless it be in gold, can satisfy those whose only anxiety is to gain\r\ngold from the Government's store.\r\n\r\nIt can not, therefore, be safe to rely upon increased revenues as a\r\ncure for our present troubles.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that the suggestion of increased revenue as a remedy for\r\nthe difficulties we are considering may have originated in an\r\nintimation or distinct allegation that the bonds which have been issued\r\nostensibly to replenish our gold reserve were really issued to supply\r\ninsufficient revenue. Nothing can be further from the truth. Bonds were\r\nissued to obtain gold for the maintenance of our national credit. As\r\nhas been shown, the gold thus obtained has been drawn again from the\r\nTreasury upon United States notes and Treasury notes. This operation\r\nwould have been promptly prevented if possible; but these notes having\r\nthus been passed to the Treasury, they became the money of the\r\nGovernment, like any other ordinary Government funds, and there was\r\nnothing to do but to use them in paying Government expenses when needed.\r\n\r\nAt no time when bonds have been issued has there been any consideration\r\nof the question of paying the expenses of Government with their\r\nproceeds. There was no necessity to consider that question. At the time\r\nof each bond issue we had a safe surplus in the Treasury for ordinary\r\noperations, exclusive of the gold in our reserve. In February, 1894,\r\nwhen the first issue of bonds was made, such surplus amounted to over\r\n$18,000,000; in November, when the second issue was made, it amounted\r\nto more than $42,000,000, and in February, 1895, when bonds for the\r\nthird time were issued, such surplus amounted to more than\r\n$100,000,000. It now amounts to $98,072,420.30.\r\n\r\nBesides all this, the Secretary of the Treasury had no authority\r\nwhatever to issue bonds to increase the ordinary revenues or pay\r\ncurrent expenses.\r\n\r\nI can not but think there has been some confusion of ideas regarding\r\nthe effects of the issue of bonds and the results of the withdrawal of\r\ngold. It was the latter process, and not the former, that, by\r\nsubstituting in the Treasury United States notes and Treasury notes for\r\ngold, increased by their amount the money which was in the first\r\ninstance subject to ordinary Government expenditure.\r\n\r\nAlthough the law compelling an increased purchase of silver by the\r\nGovernment was passed on the 14th day of July, 1890, withdrawals of\r\ngold from the Treasury upon the notes given in payment on such\r\npurchases did not begin until October, 1891. Immediately following that\r\ndate the withdrawals upon both these notes and United States notes\r\nincreased very largely, and have continued to such an extent that since\r\nthe passage of that law there has been more than thirteen times as much\r\ngold taken out of the Treasury upon United States notes and Treasury\r\nnotes issued for silver purchases as was thus withdrawn during the\r\neleven and a half years immediately prior thereto and after the 1st day\r\nof January, 1879, when specie payments were resumed.\r\n\r\nIt is neither unfair nor unjust to charge a large share of our present\r\nfinancial perplexities and dangers to the operation of the laws of 1878\r\nand 1890 compelling the purchase of silver by the Government, which not\r\nonly furnished a new Treasury obligation upon which its gold could be\r\nwithdrawn, but so increased the fear of an overwhelming flood of silver\r\nand a forced descent to silver payments that even the repeal of these\r\nlaws did not entirely cure the evils of their existence.\r\n\r\nWhile I have endeavored to make a plain statement of the disordered\r\ncondition of our currency and the present dangers menacing our\r\nprosperity and to suggest a way which leads to a safer financial\r\nsystem, I have constantly had in mind the fact that many of my\r\ncountrymen, whose sincerity I do not doubt, insist that the cure for\r\nthe ills now threatening us may be found in the single and simple\r\nremedy of the free coinage of silver. They contend that our mints shall\r\nbe at once thrown open to the free, unlimited, and independent coinage\r\nof both gold and silver dollars of full legal-tender quality,\r\nregardless of the action of any other government and in full view of\r\nthe fact that the ratio between the metals which they suggest calls for\r\n100 cents' worth of gold in the gold dollar at the present standard and\r\nonly 50 cents in intrinsic worth of silver in the silver dollar.\r\n\r\nWere there infinitely stronger reasons than can be adduced for hoping\r\nthat such action would secure for us a bimetallic currency moving on\r\nlines of parity, an experiment so novel and hazardous as that proposed\r\nmight well stagger those who believe that stability is an imperative\r\ncondition of sound money.\r\n\r\nNo government, no human contrivance or act of legislation, has ever\r\nbeen able to hold the two metals together in free coinage at a ratio\r\nappreciably different from that which is established in the markets of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nThose who believe that our independent free coinage of silver at an\r\nartificial ratio with gold of 16 to 1 would restore the parity between\r\nthe metals, and consequently between the coins, oppose an unsupported\r\nand improbable theory to the general belief and practice of other\r\nnations; and to the teaching of the wisest statesmen and economists of\r\nthe world, both in the past and present, and, what is far more\r\nconclusive, they run counter to our own actual experiences.\r\n\r\nTwice in our earlier history our lawmakers, in attempting to establish\r\na bimetallic currency, undertook free coinage upon a ratio which\r\naccidentally varied from the actual relative values of the two metals\r\nnot more than 3 per cent. In both cases, notwithstanding greater\r\ndifficulties and cost of transportation than now exist, the coins whose\r\nintrinsic worth was undervalued. in the ratio gradually and surely\r\ndisappeared from our circulation and went to other countries where\r\ntheir real value was better recognized.\r\n\r\nActs of Congress were impotent to create equality where natural causes\r\ndecreed even a slight inequality.\r\n\r\nTwice in our recent history we have signally failed to raise by\r\nlegislation the value of silver. Under an act of Congress passed in\r\n1878 the Government was required for more than twelve years to expend\r\nannually at least $24,000,000 in the purchase of silver bullion for\r\ncoinage. The act of July 14, 1890, in a still bolder effort, increased\r\nthe amount of silver the Government was compelled to purchase and\r\nforced it to become the buyer annually of 54,000,000 ounces, or\r\npractically the entire product of our mines. Under both laws silver\r\nrapidly and steadily declined in value. The prophecy and the expressed\r\nhope and expectation of those in the Congress who led in the passage of\r\nthe last-mentioned act that it would reestablish and maintain the\r\nformer parity between the two metals are still fresh in our memory.\r\n\r\nIn the light of these experiences, which accord with the experiences of\r\nother nations, there is certainly no secure ground for the belief that\r\nan act of Congress could now bridge an inequality of 50 per cent\r\nbetween gold and silver at our present ratio, nor is there the least\r\npossibility that our country, which has less than one-seventh of the\r\nsilver money in the world, could by its action alone raise not only our\r\nown but all silver to its lost ratio with gold. Our attempt to\r\naccomplish this by the free coinage of silver at a ratio differing\r\nwidely from actual relative values would be the signal for the complete\r\ndeparture of gold from our circulation, the immediate and large\r\ncontraction of our circulating medium, and a shrinkage in the real\r\nvalue and monetary efficiency of all other forms of currency as they\r\nsettled to the level of silver monometallism. Everyone who receives a\r\nfixed salary and every worker for wages would find the dollar in his\r\nhand ruthlessly scaled down to the point of bitter disappointment, if\r\nnot to pinching privation.\r\n\r\nA change in our standard to silver monometallism would also bring on a\r\ncollapse of the entire system of credit, which, when based on a\r\nstandard which is recognized and adopted by the world of business, is\r\nmany times more potent and useful than the entire volume of currency\r\nand is safely capable of almost indefinite expansion to meet the growth\r\nof trade and enterprise. In a self-invited struggle through darkness\r\nand uncertainty our humiliation would be increased by the consciousness\r\nthat we had parted company with all the enlightened and progressive\r\nnations of the world and were desperately and hopelessly striving to\r\nmeet the stress of modern commerce and competition with a debased and\r\nunsuitable currency and in association with the few weak and laggard\r\nnations which have silver alone as their standard of value.\r\n\r\nAll history warns us against rash experiments which threaten violent\r\nchanges in our monetary standard and the degradation of our currency.\r\nThe past is full of lessons teaching not only the economic dangers but\r\nthe national immorality that follow in the train of such experiments. I\r\nwill not believe that the American people can be persuaded after sober\r\ndeliberation to jeopardize their nation's prestige and proud standing\r\nby encouraging financial nostrums, nor that they will yield to the\r\nfalse allurements of cheap money when they realize that it must result\r\nin the weakening of that financial integrity and rectitude which thus\r\nfar in our history has been so devotedly cherished as one of the traits\r\nof true Americanism.\r\n\r\nOur country's indebtedness, whether owing by the Government or existing\r\nbetween individuals, has been contracted with reference to our present\r\nstandard. To decree by act of Congress that these debts shall be\r\npayable in less valuable dollars than those within the contemplation\r\nand intention of the parties when contracted would operate to transfer\r\nby the fiat of law and without compensation an amount of property and a\r\nvolume of rights and interests almost incalculable.\r\n\r\nThose who advocate a blind and headlong plunge to free coinage in the\r\nname of bimetallism, and professing the belief, contrary to all\r\nexperience, that we could thus establish a double standard and a\r\nconcurrent circulation of both metals in our coinage, are certainly\r\nreckoning from a cloudy standpoint. Our present standard of value is\r\nthe standard of the civilized world and permits the only bimetallism\r\nnow possible, or at least that is within the independent reach of any\r\nsingle nation, however powerful that nation may be. While the value of\r\ngold as a standard is steadied by almost universal commercial and\r\nbusiness use, it does not despise silver nor seek its banishment.\r\nWherever this standard is maintained there is at its side in free and\r\nunquestioned circulation a volume of silver currency sometimes equaling\r\nand sometimes even exceeding it in amount both maintained at a parity\r\nnotwithstanding a depreciation or fluctuation in the intrinsic value of\r\nsilver.\r\n\r\nThere is a vast difference between a standard of value and a currency\r\nfor monetary use. The standard must necessarily be fixed and certain.\r\nThe currency may be in divers forms and of various kinds. No\r\nsilver-standard country has a gold currency in circulation, but an\r\nenlightened and wise system of finance secures the benefits of both\r\ngold and silver as currency and circulating medium by keeping the\r\nstandard stable and all other currency at par with it. Such a system\r\nand such a standard also give free scope for the use and expansion of\r\nsafe and conservative credit, so indispensable to broad and growing\r\ncommercial transactions and so well substituted for the actual use of\r\nmoney. If a fixed and stable standard is maintained, such as the\r\nmagnitude and safety of our commercial transactions and business\r\nrequire, the use of money itself is conveniently minimized.\r\n\r\nEvery dollar of fixed and stable value has through the agency of\r\nconfident credit an astonishing capacity of multiplying itself in\r\nfinancial work. Every unstable and fluctuating dollar fails as a basis\r\nof credit, and in its use begets gambling speculation and undermines\r\nthe foundations of honest enterprise.\r\n\r\nI have ventured to express myself on this subject with earnestness and\r\nplainness of speech because I can not rid myself of the belief that\r\nthere lurk in the proposition for the free coinage of silver, so\r\nstrongly approved and so enthusiastically advocated by a multitude of\r\nmy countrymen, a serious menace to our prosperity and an insidious\r\ntemptation of our people to wander from the allegiance they owe to\r\npublic and private integrity. It is because I do not distrust the good\r\nfaith and sincerity of those who press this scheme that I have\r\nimperfectly but with zeal submitted my thoughts upon this momentous\r\nsubject. I can not refrain from begging them to reexamine their views\r\nand beliefs in the light of patriotic reason and familiar experience\r\nand to weigh again and again the consequences of such legislation as\r\ntheir efforts have invited. Even the continued agitation of the subject\r\nadds greatly to the difficulties of a dangerous financial situation\r\nalready forced upon us.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I especially entreat the people's representatives in the\r\nCongress, who are charged with the responsibility of inaugurating\r\nmeasures for the safety and prosperity of our common country, to\r\npromptly and effectively consider the ills of our critical financial\r\nplight. I have suggested a remedy which my judgment approves. I desire,\r\nhowever, to assure the Congress that I am prepared to cooperate with\r\nthem in perfecting any other measure promising thorough and practical\r\nrelief, and that I will gladly labor with them in every patriotic\r\nendeavor to further the interests and guard the welfare of our\r\ncountrymen, whom in our respective places of duty we have undertaken to\r\nserve.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nGrover Cleveland\r\nDecember 7, 1896\r\n\r\nTo the Congress of the United States:\r\n\r\nAs representatives of the people in the legislative branch of their\r\nGovernment, you have assembled at a time when the strength and\r\nexcellence of our free institutions and the fitness of our citizens to\r\nenjoy popular rule have been again made manifest. A political contest\r\ninvolving momentous consequences, fraught with feverish apprehension,\r\nand creating aggressiveness so intense as to approach bitterness and\r\npassion has been waged throughout our land and determined by the decree\r\nof free and independent suffrage without disturbance of our\r\ntranquillity or the least sign of weakness in our national structure.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider these incidents and contemplate the peaceful obedience\r\nand manly submission which have succeeded a heated clash of political\r\nopinions, we discover abundant evidence of a determination on the part\r\nof our countrymen to abide by every verdict of the popular will and to\r\nbe controlled at all times by an abiding faith in the agencies\r\nestablished for the direction of the affairs of their Government.\r\n\r\nThus our people exhibit a patriotic disposition which entitles them to\r\ndemand of those who undertake to make and execute their laws such\r\nfaithful and unselfish service in their behalf as can only be prompted\r\nby a serious appreciation of the trust and confidence which the\r\nacceptance of public duty invites.\r\n\r\nIn obedience to a constitutional requirement I herein submit to the\r\nCongress certain information concerning national affairs, with the\r\nsuggestion of such legislation as in my judgment is necessary and\r\nexpedient. To secure brevity and avoid tiresome narration I shall omit\r\nmany details concerning matters within Federal control which, though by\r\nno means unimportant, are more profitably discussed in departmental\r\nreports. I shall also further curtail this communication by omitting a\r\nminute recital of many minor incidents connected with our foreign\r\nrelations which have heretofore found a place in Executive messages,\r\nbut are now contained in a report of the Secretary of State, which is\r\nherewith submitted.\r\n\r\nAt the outset of a reference to the more important matters affecting\r\nour relations with foreign powers it would afford me satisfaction if I\r\ncould assure the Congress that the disturbed condition in Asiatic\r\nTurkey had during the past year assumed a less hideous and bloody\r\naspect and that, either as a consequence of the awakening of the\r\nTurkish Government to the demands of humane civilization or as the\r\nresult of decisive action on the part of the great nations having the\r\nright by treaty to interfere for the protection of those exposed to the\r\nrage of mad bigotry and cruel fanaticism, the shocking features of the\r\nsituation had been mitigated. Instead, however, of welcoming a softened\r\ndisposition or protective intervention, we have been afflicted by\r\ncontinued and not unfrequent reports of the wanton destruction of homes\r\nand the bloody butchery of men, women, and children, made martyrs to\r\ntheir profession of Christian faith.\r\n\r\nWhile none of our citizens in Turkey have thus far been killed or\r\nwounded, though often in the midst of dreadful scenes of danger, their\r\nsafety in the future is by no means assured. Our Government at home and\r\nour minister at Constantinople have left nothing undone to protect our\r\nmissionaries in Ottoman territory, who constitute nearly all the\r\nindividuals residing there who have a right to claim our protection on\r\nthe score of American citizenship. Our efforts in this direction will\r\nnot be relaxed; but the deep feeling and sympathy that have been\r\naroused among our people ought not to so far blind their reason and\r\njudgment as to lead them to demand impossible things. The outbreaks of\r\nthe blind fury which lead to murder and pillage in Turkey occur\r\nsuddenly and without notice, and an attempt on our part to force such a\r\nhostile presence there as might be effective for prevention or\r\nprotection would not only be resisted by the Ottoman Government, but\r\nwould be regarded as an interruption of their plans by the great\r\nnations who assert their exclusive right to intervene in their own time\r\nand method for the security of life and property in Turkey.\r\n\r\nSeveral naval vessels are stationed in the Mediterranean as a measure\r\nof caution and to furnish all possible relief and refuge in case of\r\nemergency.\r\n\r\nWe have made claims against the Turkish Government for the pillage and\r\ndestruction of missionary property at Harpoot and Marash during\r\nuprisings at those places. Thus far the validity of these demands has\r\nnot been admitted, though our minister, prior to such outrages and in\r\nanticipation of danger, demanded protection for the persons and\r\nproperty of our missionary citizens in the localities mentioned and\r\nnotwithstanding that strong evidence exists of actual complicity of\r\nTurkish soldiers in the work of destruction and robbery.\r\n\r\nThe facts as they now appear do not permit us to doubt the justice of\r\nthese claims, and nothing will be omitted to bring about their prompt\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\nA number of Armenian refugees having arrived at our ports, an order has\r\nlately been obtained from the Turkish Government permitting the wives\r\nand children of such refugees to join them here. It is hoped that\r\nhereafter no obstacle will be interposed to prevent the escape of all\r\nthose who seek to avoid the perils which threaten them in Turkish\r\ndominions.\r\n\r\nOur recently appointed consul to Erzerum is at his post and discharging\r\nthe duties of his office, though for some unaccountable reason his\r\nformal exequatur from the Sultan has not been issued.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that the present somber prospect in Turkey will be\r\nlong permitted to offend the sight of Christendom. It so mars the\r\nhumane and enlightened civilization that belongs to the close of the\r\nnineteenth century that it seems hardly possible that the earnest\r\ndemand of good people throughout the Christian world for its corrective\r\ntreatment will remain unanswered.\r\n\r\nThe insurrection in Cuba still continues with all its perplexities. It\r\nis difficult to perceive that any progress has thus far been made\r\ntoward the pacification of the island or that the situation of affairs\r\nas depicted in my last annual message has in the least improved. If\r\nSpain still holds Havana and the seaports and all the considerable\r\ntowns, the insurgents still roam at will over at least two-thirds of\r\nthe inland country. If the determination of Spain to put down the\r\ninsurrection seems but to strengthen with the lapse of time and is\r\nevinced by her unhesitating devotion of largely increased military and\r\nnaval forces to the task, there is much reason to believe that the\r\ninsurgents have gained in point of numbers and character and resources\r\nand are none the less inflexible in their resolve not to succumb\r\nwithout practically securing the great objects for which they took up\r\narms. If Spain has not yet reestablished her authority, neither have\r\nthe insurgents yet made good their title to be regarded as an\r\nindependent state. Indeed, as the contest has gone on the pretense that\r\ncivil government exists on the island, except so far as Spain is able\r\nto maintain it, has been practically abandoned. Spain does keep on foot\r\nsuch a government, more or less imperfectly, in the large towns and\r\ntheir immediate suburbs; but that exception being made, the entire\r\ncountry is either given over to anarchy or is subject to the military\r\noccupation of one or the other party. It is reported, indeed, on\r\nreliable authority that at the demand of the commander in chief of the\r\ninsurgent army the putative Cuban government has now given up all\r\nattempt to exercise its functions, leaving that government confessedly\r\n(what there is the best reason for supposing it always to have been in\r\nfact) a government merely on paper.\r\n\r\nWere the Spanish armies able to meet their antagonists in the open or\r\nin pitched battle, prompt and decisive results might be looked for, and\r\nthe immense superiority of the Spanish forces in numbers, discipline,\r\nand equipment could hardly fail to tell greatly to their advantage. But\r\nthey are called upon to face a foe that shuns general engagements, that\r\ncan choose and does choose its own ground, that from the nature of the\r\ncountry is visible or invisible at pleasure, and that fights only from\r\nambuscade and when all the advantages of position and numbers are on\r\nits side. In a country where all that is indispensable to life in the\r\nway of food, clothing, and shelter is so easily obtainable, especially\r\nby those born and bred on the soil, it is obvious that there is hardly\r\na limit to the time during which hostilities of this sort may be\r\nprolonged. Meanwhile, as in all cases of protracted civil strife, the\r\npassions of the combatants grow more and more inflamed and excesses on\r\nboth sides become more frequent and more deplorable. They are also\r\nparticipated in by bands of marauders, who, now in the name of one\r\nparty and now in the name of the other, as may best suit the occasion,\r\nharry the country at will and plunder its wretched inhabitants for\r\ntheir own advantage. Such a condition of things would inevitably entail\r\nimmense destruction of property, even if it were the policy of both\r\nparties to prevent it as far as practicable; but while such seemed to\r\nbe the original policy of the Spanish Government, it has now apparently\r\nabandoned it and is acting upon the same theory as the insurgents,\r\nnamely, that the exigencies of the contest require the wholesale\r\nannihilation of property that it may not prove of use and advantage to\r\nthe enemy.\r\n\r\nIt is to the same end that, in pursuance of general orders, Spanish\r\ngarrisons are now being withdrawn from plantations and the rural\r\npopulation required to concentrate itself in the towns. The sure result\r\nwould seem to be that the industrial value of the island is fast\r\ndiminishing and that unless there is a speedy and radical change in\r\nexisting conditions it will soon disappear altogether. That value\r\nconsists very largely, of course, in its capacity to produce sugar--a\r\ncapacity already much reduced by the interruptions to tillage which\r\nhave taken place during the last two years. It is reliably asserted\r\nthat should these interruptions continue during the current year, and\r\npractically extend, as is now threatened, to the entire sugar-producing\r\nterritory of the island, so much time and so much money will be\r\nrequired to restore the land to its normal productiveness that it is\r\nextremely doubtful if capital can be induced to even make the attempt.\r\n\r\nThe spectacle of the utter ruin of an adjoining country, by nature one\r\nof the most fertile and charming on the globe, would engage the serious\r\nattention of the Government and people of the United States in any\r\ncircumstances. In point of fact, they have a concern with it which is\r\nby no means of a wholly sentimental or philanthropic character. It lies\r\nso near to us as to be hardly separated from our territory. Our actual\r\npecuniary interest in it is second only to that of the people and\r\nGovernment of Spain. It is reasonably estimated that at least from\r\n$30,000,000 to $50,000,000 of American capital are invested in\r\nplantations and in railroad, mining, and other business enterprises on\r\nthe island. The volume of trade between the United States and Cuba,\r\nwhich in 1889 amounted to about $64,000,000, rose in 1893 to about\r\n$103,000,000, and in 1894, the year before the present insurrection\r\nbroke out, amounted to nearly $96,000,000. Besides this large pecuniary\r\nstake in the fortunes of Cuba, the United States finds itself\r\ninextricably involved in the present contest in other ways, both\r\nvexatious and costly.\r\n\r\nMany Cubans reside in this country, and indirectly promote the\r\ninsurrection through the press, by public meetings, by the purchase and\r\nshipment of arms, by the raising of funds, and by other means which the\r\nspirit of our institutions and the tenor of our laws do not permit to\r\nbe made the subject of criminal prosecutions. Some of them, though\r\nCubans at heart and in all their feelings and interests, have taken out\r\npapers as naturalized citizens of the United States--a proceeding\r\nresorted to with a view to possible protection by this Government, and\r\nnot unnaturally regarded with much indignation by the country of their\r\norigin. The insurgents are undoubtedly encouraged and supported by the\r\nwidespread sympathy the people of this country always and instinctively\r\nfeel for every struggle for better and freer government, and which, in\r\nthe case of the more adventurous and restless elements of our\r\npopulation, leads in only too many instances to active and personal\r\nparticipation in the contest. The result is that this Government is\r\nconstantly called upon to protect American citizens, to claim damages\r\nfor injuries to persons and property, now estimated at many millions of\r\ndollars, and to ask explanations and apologies for the acts of Spanish\r\nofficials whose zeal for the repression of rebellion sometimes blinds\r\nthem to the immunities belonging to the unoffending citizens of a\r\nfriendly power. It follows from the same causes that the United States\r\nis compelled to actively police a long line of seacoast against\r\nunlawful expeditions, the escape of which the utmost vigilance will not\r\nalways suffice to prevent.\r\n\r\nThese inevitable entanglements of the United States with the rebellion\r\nin Cuba, the large American property interests affected, and\r\nconsiderations of philanthropy and humanity in general have led to a\r\nvehement demand in various quarters for some sort of positive\r\nintervention on the part of the United States. It was at first proposed\r\nthat belligerent rights should be accorded to the insurgents--a\r\nproposition no longer urged because untimely and in practical operation\r\ndearly perilous and injurious to our own interests. It has since been\r\nand is now sometimes contended that the independence of the insurgents\r\nshould be recognized; but imperfect and restricted as the Spanish\r\ngovernment of the island may be, no other exists there, unless the will\r\nof the military officer in temporary command of a particular district\r\ncan be dignified as a species of government. It is now also suggested\r\nthat the United States should buy the island--a suggestion possibly\r\nworthy of consideration if there were any evidence of a desire or\r\nwillingness on the part of Spain to entertain such a proposal. It is\r\nurged finally that, all other methods failing, the existing internecine\r\nstrife in Cuba should be terminated by our intervention, even at the\r\ncost of a war between the United States and Spain--a war which its\r\nadvocates confidently prophesy could neither be large in its\r\nproportions nor doubtful in its issue.\r\n\r\nThe correctness of this forecast need be neither affirmed nor denied.\r\nThe United States has, nevertheless, a character to maintain as a\r\nnation, which plainly dictates that right and not might should be the\r\nrule of its conduct. Further, though the United States is not a nation\r\nto which peace is a necessity, it is in truth the most pacific of\r\npowers and desires nothing so much as to live in amity with all the\r\nworld. Its own ample and diversified domains satisfy all possible\r\nlongings for territory, preclude all dreams of conquest, and prevent\r\nany casting of covetous eyes upon neighboring regions, however\r\nattractive. That our conduct toward Spain and her dominions has\r\nconstituted no exception to this national disposition is made manifest\r\nby the course of our Government, not only thus far during the present\r\ninsurrection, but during the ten years that followed the rising at Yara\r\nin 1868. No other great power, it may safely be said, under\r\ncircumstances of similar perplexity, would have manifested the same\r\nrestraint and the same patient endurance. It may also be said that this\r\npersistent attitude of the United States toward Spain in connection\r\nwith Cuba unquestionably evinces no slight respect and regard for Spain\r\non the part of the American people. They in truth do not forget her\r\nconnection with the discovery of the Western Hemisphere, nor do they\r\nunderestimate the great qualities of the Spanish people nor fail to\r\nfully recognize their splendid patriotism and their chivalrous devotion\r\nto the national honor.\r\n\r\nThey view with wonder and admiration the cheerful resolution with which\r\nvast bodies of men are sent across thousands of miles of ocean and an\r\nenormous debt accumulated that the costly possession of the gem of the\r\nAntilles may still hold its place in the Spanish crown. And yet neither\r\nthe Government nor the people of the United States have shut their eyes\r\nto the course of events in Cuba or have failed to realize the existence\r\nof conceded grievances which have led to the present revolt from the\r\nauthority of Spain--grievances recognized by the Queen Regent and by\r\nthe Cortes, voiced by the most patriotic and enlightened of Spanish\r\nstatesmen, without regard to party, and demonstrated by reforms\r\nproposed by the executive and approved by the legislative branch of the\r\nSpanish Government. It is in the assumed temper and disposition of the\r\nSpanish Government to remedy these grievances, fortified by indications\r\nof influential public opinion in Spain, that this Government has hoped\r\nto discover the most promising and effective means of composing the\r\npresent strife with honor and advantage to Spain and with the\r\nachievement of all the reasonable objects of the insurrection.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that if Spain should offer to Cuba genuine autonomy--a\r\nmeasure of home rule which, while preserving the sovereignty of Spain,\r\nwould satisfy all rational requirements of her Spanish subjects--there\r\nshould be no just reason why the pacification of the island might not\r\nbe effected on that basis. Such a result would appear to be in the true\r\ninterest of all concerned. It would at once stop the conflict which is\r\nnow consuming the resources of the island and making it worthless for\r\nwhichever party may ultimately prevail. It would keep intact the\r\npossessions of Spain without touching her honor, which will be\r\nconsulted rather than impugned by the adequate redress of admitted\r\ngrievances. It would put the prosperity of the island and the fortunes\r\nof its inhabitants within their own control without severing the\r\nnatural and ancient ties which bind them to the mother country, and\r\nwould yet enable them to test their capacity for self-government under\r\nthe most favorable conditions. It has been objected on the one side\r\nthat Spain should not promise autonomy until her insurgent subjects lay\r\ndown their arms; on the other side, that promised autonomy, however\r\nliberal, is insufficient, because without assurance of the promise\r\nbeing fulfilled.\r\n\r\nBut the reasonableness of a requirement by Spain of unconditional\r\nsurrender on the part of the insurgent Cubans before their autonomy is\r\nconceded is not altogether apparent. It ignores important features of\r\nthe situation--the stability two years' duration has given to the\r\ninsurrection; the feasibility of its indefinite prolongation in the\r\nnature of things, and, as shown by past experience, the utter and\r\nimminent ruin of the island unless the present strife is speedily\r\ncomposed; above all, the rank abuses which all parties in Spain, all\r\nbranches of her Government, and all her leading public men concede to\r\nexist and profess a desire to remove. Facing such circumstances, to\r\nwithhold the proffer of needed reforms until the parties demanding them\r\nput themselves at mercy by throwing down their arms has the appearance\r\nof neglecting the gravest of perils and inviting suspicion as to the\r\nsincerity of any professed willingness to grant reforms. The objection\r\non behalf of the insurgents that promised reforms can not be relied\r\nupon must of course be considered, though we have no right to assume\r\nand no reason for assuming that anything Spain undertakes to do for the\r\nrelief of Cuba will not be done according to both the spirit and the\r\nletter of the undertaking.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, realizing that suspicions and precautions on the part of\r\nthe weaker of two combatants are always natural and not always\r\nunjustifiable, being sincerely desirous in the interest of both as well\r\nas on its own account that the Cuban problem should be solved with the\r\nleast possible delay, it was intimated by this Government to the\r\nGovernment of Spain some months ago that if a satisfactory measure of\r\nhome rule were tendered the Cuban insurgents and would be accepted by\r\nthem upon a guaranty of its execution the United States would endeavor\r\nto find a way not objectionable to Spain of furnishing such graranty.\r\nWhile no definite response to this intimation has yet been received\r\nfrom the Spanish Government, it is believed to be not altogether\r\nunwelcome, while, as already suggested, no reason is perceived why it\r\nshould not be approved by the insurgents. Neither party can fail to see\r\nthe importance of early action, and both must realize that to prolong\r\nthe present state of things for even a short period will add enormously\r\nto the time and labor and expenditure necessary to bring about the\r\nindustrial recuperation of the island. It is therefore fervently hoped\r\non all grounds that earnest efforts for healing the breach between\r\nSpain and the insurgent Cubans upon the lines above indicated may be at\r\nonce inaugurated and pushed to an immediate and successful issue. The\r\nfriendly offices of the United States, either in the manner above\r\noutlined or in any other way consistent with our Constitution and laws,\r\nwill always be at the disposal of either party.\r\n\r\nWhatever circumstances may arise, our policy and our interests would\r\nconstrain us to object to the acquisition of the island or an\r\ninterference with its control by any other power.\r\n\r\nIt should be added that it can not be reasonably assumed that the\r\nhitherto expectant attitude of the United States will be indefinitely\r\nmaintained. While we are anxious to accord all due respect to the\r\nsovereignty of Spain, we can not view the pending conflict in all its\r\nfeatures and properly apprehend our inevitably close relations to it\r\nand its possible results without considering that by the course of\r\nevents we may be drawn into such an unusual and unprecedented condition\r\nas will fix a limit to our patient waiting for Spain to end the\r\ncontest, either alone and in her own way or with our friendly\r\ncooperation.\r\n\r\nWhen the inability of Spain to deal successfully with the insurrection\r\nhas become manifest and it is demonstrated that her sovereignty is\r\nextinct in Cuba for all purposes of its rightful existence, and when a\r\nhopeless struggle for its reestablishment has degenerated into a strife\r\nwhich means nothing more than the useless sacrifice of human life and\r\nthe utter destruction of the very subject-matter of the conflict, a\r\nsituation will be presented in which our obligations to the sovereignty\r\nof Spain will be superseded by higher obligations, which we can hardly\r\nhesitate to recognize and discharge. Deferring the choice of ways and\r\nmethods until the time for action arrives, we should make them depend\r\nupon the precise conditions then existing; and they should not be\r\ndetermined upon without giving careful heed to every consideration\r\ninvolving our honor and interest or the international duty we owe to\r\nSpain. Until we face the contingencies suggested or the situation is by\r\nother incidents imperatively changed we should continue in the line of\r\nconduct heretofore pursued, thus in all circumstances exhibiting our\r\nobedience to the requirements of public law and our regard for the duty\r\nenjoined upon us by the position we occupy in the family of nations.\r\n\r\nA contemplation of emergencies that may arise should plainly lead us to\r\navoid their creation, either through a careless disregard of present\r\nduty or even an undue stimulation and ill-timed expression of feeling.\r\nBut I have deemed it not amiss to remind the Congress that a time may\r\narrive when a correct policy and care for our interests, as well as a\r\nregard for the interests of other nations and their citizens, joined by\r\nconsiderations of humanity and a desire to see a rich and fertile\r\ncountry intimately related to us saved from complete devastation, will\r\nconstrain our Government to such action as will subserve the interests\r\nthus involved and at the same time promise to Cuba and its inhabitants\r\nan opportunity to enjoy the blessings of peace.\r\n\r\nThe Venezuelan boundary question has ceased to be a matter of\r\ndifference between Great Britain and the United States, their\r\nrespective Governments having agreed upon the substantial provisions of\r\na treaty between Great Britain and Venezuela submitting the whole\r\ncontroversy to arbitration. The provisions of the treaty are so\r\neminently just and fair that the assent of Venezuela thereto may\r\nconfidently be anticipated.\r\n\r\nNegotiations for a treaty of general arbitration for all differences\r\nbetween Great Britain and the United States are far advanced and\r\npromise to reach a successful consummation at an early date.\r\n\r\nThe scheme of examining applicants for certain consular positions to\r\ntest their competency and fitness, adopted under an Executive order\r\nissued on the 20th of September, 1895, has fully demonstrated the\r\nusefulness of this innovation. In connection with this plan of\r\nexamination promotions and transfers of deserving incumbents have been\r\nquite extensively made, with excellent results.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year 35 appointments have been made in the consular\r\nservice, 27 of which were made to fill vacancies caused by death or\r\nresignation or to supply newly created posts, 2 to succeed incumbents\r\nremoved for cause, 2 for the purpose of displacing alien consular\r\nofficials by American citizens, and 4 merely changing the official\r\ntitle of incumbent from commercial agent to consul. Twelve of these\r\nappointments were transfers or promotions from other positions under\r\nthe Department of State, 4 of those appointed had rendered previous\r\nservice under the Department, 8 were made of persons who passed a\r\nsatisfactory examination, 7 were appointed to places not included in\r\nthe order of September 20, 1895, and 4 appointments, as above stated,\r\ninvolved no change of incumbency. The inspection of consular offices\r\nprovided for by an appropriation for that purpose at the last session\r\nof the Congress has been productive of such wholesome effects that I\r\nhope this important work will in the future be continued. I know of\r\nnothing that can be done with the same slight expense so improving to\r\nthe service.\r\n\r\nI desire to repeat the recommendation contained in my last annual\r\nmessage in favor of providing at public expense official residences for\r\nour ambassadors and ministers at foreign capitals. The reasons\r\nsupporting this recommendation are strongly stated in the report of the\r\nSecretary of State, and the subject seems of such importance that I\r\nhope it may receive the early attention of the Congress.\r\n\r\nWe have during the last year labored faithfully and against unfavorable\r\nconditions to secure better preservation of seal life in the Bering\r\nSea. Both the United States and Great Britain have lately dispatched\r\ncommissioners to these waters to study the habits and condition of the\r\nseal herd and the causes of their rapid decrease. Upon the reports of\r\nthese commissioners, soon to be submitted, and with the exercise of\r\npatience and good sense on the part of all interested parties, it is\r\nearnestly hoped that hearty cooperation may be secured for the\r\nprotection against threatened extinction of seal life in the Northern\r\nPacific and Bering Sea.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury reports that during the fiscal year ended\r\nJune 30, 1896, the receipts of the Government from all sources amounted\r\nto $409,475,408.78. During the same period its expenditures were\r\n$434,678,654.48, the excess of expenditures over receipts thus\r\namounting to $25,203,245.70. The ordinary expenditures during the year\r\nwere $4,015,852.21 less than during the preceding fiscal year. Of the\r\nreceipts mentioned there was derived from customs the sum of\r\n$160,021,751.67 and from internal revenue $146,830,615.66. The receipts\r\nfrom customs show an increase of $7,863,134.22 over those from the same\r\nsource for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1895, and the receipts from\r\ninternal revenue an increase of $3,584,537.91.\r\n\r\nThe value of our imported dutiable merchandise during the last fiscal\r\nyear was $369,757,470 and the value of free goods imported\r\n$409,967,470, being an increase of $6,523,675 in the value of dutiable\r\ngoods and $41,231,034 in the value of free goods over the preceding\r\nyear. Our exports of merchandise, foreign and domestic, amounted in\r\nvalue to $882,606,938, being an increase over the preceding year of\r\n$75,068,773. The average ad valorem duty paid on dutiable goods\r\nimported during the year was 39.94 per cent and on free and dutiable\r\ngoods taken together 20.55 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe cost of collecting our internal revenue was 2.78 per cent, as\r\nagainst 2.81 per cent for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1895. The\r\ntotal production of distilled spirits, exclusive of fruit brandies, was\r\n86,588,703 taxable gallons, being an increase of 6,639,108 gallons over\r\nthe preceding year. There was also an increase of 1,443,676 gallons of\r\nspirits produced from fruit as compared with the preceding year. The\r\nnumber of barrels of beer produced was 35,859,250, as against\r\n33,589,784 produced in the preceding fiscal year, being all increase of\r\n2,269,466 barrels.\r\n\r\nThe total amount of gold exported during the last fiscal year was\r\n$112,409,947 and of silver $60,541,670, being an increase of\r\n$45,941,466 of gold and $13,246,384 of silver over the exportations of\r\nthe preceding fiscal year. The imports of gold were $33,525,065 and of\r\nsilver $28,777,186, being $2,859,695 less of gold and $8,566,007 more\r\nof silver than during the preceding year.\r\n\r\nThe total stock of metallic money in the United States at the close of\r\nthe last fiscal year, ended on the 30th day of June, 1896, was\r\n$1,228,326,035, of which $599,597,964 was in gold and $628,728,071 in\r\nsilver.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st day of November, 1896, the total stock of money of all kinds\r\nin the country was $2,285,410,590, and the amount in circulation, not\r\nincluding that in the Treasury holdings, was $1,627,055,641, being\r\n$22.63 per capita upon an estimated population of 71,902,000.\r\n\r\nThe production of the precious metals in the United States during the\r\ncalendar year 1895 is estimated to have been 2,254,760 fine ounces of\r\ngold, of the value of $46,610,000, and 55,727,000 fine ounces of\r\nsilver, of the commercial value of $36,445,000 and the coinage value of\r\n$72,051,000. The estimated production of these metals throughout the\r\nworld during the same period was 9,688,821 fine ounces of gold,\r\namounting to $200,285,700 in value, and 169,189,249 fine ounces of\r\nsilver, of the commercial value of $110,654,000 and of the coinage\r\nvalue of $218,738,100 according to our ratio.\r\n\r\nThe coinage of these metals in the various countries of the world\r\nduring the same calendar year amounted to $232,701,438 in gold and\r\n$121,996,219 in silver.\r\n\r\nThe total coinage at the mints of the United States during the fiscal\r\nyear ended June 30, 1896, amounted to $71,188,468.52, of which\r\n$58,878,490 was in gold coins and $12,309,978.52 in standard silver\r\ndollars, subsidiary coins, and minor coins\r\n\r\nThe number of national banks organized from the time the law\r\nauthorizing their creation was passed up to October 31, 1896, was\r\n5,051, and of this number 3,679 were at the date last mentioned in\r\nactive operation, having authorized capital stock of $650,014,895, held\r\nby 288,902 shareholders, and circulating notes amounting to\r\n$211,412,620.\r\n\r\nThe total outstanding circulating notes of all national banks on the\r\n31st day of October, 1896, amounted to $234,553,807, including\r\nunredeemed but fully secured notes of banks insolvent and in process of\r\nliquidation. The increase in national-bank circulation during the year\r\nending on that day was $21,099,429. On October 6, 1896, when the\r\ncondition of national banks was last reported, the total resources of\r\nthe 3,679 active institutions were $3,263,685,313.83, which included\r\n$1,893,268,839.31 in loans and discounts and $362,165,733.85 in money\r\nof all kinds on hand. Of their liabilities $1,597,891,058.03 was due to\r\nindividual depositors and $209,944,019 consisted of outstanding\r\ncirculating notes.\r\n\r\nThere were organized during the year preceding the date last mentioned\r\n28 national banks, located in 15 States, of which 12 were organized in\r\nthe Eastern States, with a capital of $1,180,000, 6 in the Western\r\nStates, with a capital of $875,000, and 10 in the Southern States, with\r\na capital of $1,190,000. During the year, however, 37 banks voluntarily\r\nabandoned their franchises under the national law, and in the case of\r\n27 others it was found necessary to appoint receivers. Therefore, as\r\ncompared with the year preceding, there was a decrease of 36 in the\r\nnumber of active banks.\r\n\r\nThe number of existing banks organized under State laws is 5,708. The\r\nnumber of immigrants arriving in the United States during the fiscal\r\nyear was 343,267, of whom 340,468 were permitted to land and 2,799 were\r\ndebarred on various grounds prescribed by law and returned to the\r\ncountries whence they came at the expense of the steamship companies by\r\nwhich they were brought in. The increase in immigration over the\r\npreceding year amounted to 84,731. It is reported that with some\r\nexceptions the immigrants of the past year were of a hardy laboring\r\nclass, accustomed and able to earn a support for themselves, and it is\r\nestimated that the money brought with them amounted to at least\r\n$5,000,000, though it was probably much in excess of that sum, since\r\nonly those having less than $30 are required to disclose the exact\r\namount, and it is known that many brought considerable sums of money to\r\nbuy land and build homes. Including all the immigrants arriving who\r\nwere over 14 years of age, 28.63 per cent were illiterate, as against\r\n20.37 per cent of those of that age arriving during the preceding\r\nfiscal year. The number of immigrants over 14 years old, the countries\r\nfrom which they came, and the percentage of illiterates among them were\r\nas follows: Italy, 57,515, with 54.59 per cent; Ireland, 37,496, with 7\r\nper cent; Russia, 35,188, with 41.14 per cent; Austria-Hungary and\r\nprovinces, 57,053, with 38.92 per cent; Germany, 25,334, with 2.96 per\r\ncent; Sweden, 18,821, with 1.16 per cent; while from Portugal there\r\ncame 2,067, of whom 77.69 per cent were illiterate. There arrived from\r\nJapan during the year only 1,110 immigrants, and it is the opinion of\r\nthe immigration authorities that the apprehension heretofore existing\r\nto some extent of a large immigration from Japan to the United States\r\nis without any substantial foundation.\r\n\r\nFrom the Life-Saving Service it is reported that the number of\r\ndisasters to documented vessels within the limits of its operations\r\nduring the year was 437. These vessels had on board 4,608 persons, of\r\nwhom 4,595 were saved and 13 lost. The value of such vessels is\r\nestimated at $8,880,140 and of their cargoes $3,846,380, making the\r\ntotal value of property imperiled $12,726,520. Of this amount\r\n$11,292,707 was saved and $1,432,750 was lost. Sixty-seven of the\r\nvessels were totally wrecked. There were besides 243 casualties to\r\nsmall undocumented craft, on board of which there were 594 persons, of\r\nwhom 587 were saved and 7 were lost. The value of the property involved\r\nin these latter casualties is estimated at $119,265, of which $114,915\r\nwas saved and $4,350 was lost. The life-saving crews during the year\r\nalso rescued or assisted numerous other vessels and warned many from\r\ndanger by signals, both by day and night. The number of disasters\r\nduring the year exceeded that of any previous year in the history of\r\nthe service, but the saving of both life and property was greater than\r\never before in proportion to the value of the property involved and to\r\nthe number of persons imperiled.\r\n\r\nThe operations of the Marine-Hospital Service, the Revenue-Cutter\r\nService, the Steamboat-Inspection Service, the Light-House Service, the\r\nBureau of Navigation, and other branches of public work attached to the\r\nTreasury Department, together with various recommendations concerning\r\ntheir support and improvement, are fully stated in the report of the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, to which the attention of the Congress is\r\nespecially invited.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War exhibits satisfactory conditions in\r\nthe several branches of the public service intrusted to his charge.\r\n\r\nThe limit of our military force as fixed by law is constantly and\r\nreadily maintained. The present discipline and morale of our Army are\r\nexcellent, and marked progress and efficiency are apparent throughout\r\nits entire organization.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of delicate duties in the suppression of slight\r\nIndian disturbances along our southwestern boundary, in which the\r\nMexican troops cooperated, and the compulsory but peaceful return, with\r\nthe consent of Great Britain, of a band of Cree Indians from Montana to\r\nthe British possessions, no active operations have been required of the\r\nArmy during the year past.\r\n\r\nChanges in methods of administration, the abandonment of unnecessary\r\nposts and consequent concentration of troops, and the exercise of care\r\nand vigilance by the various officers charged with the responsibility\r\nin the expenditure of the appropriations have resulted in reducing to a\r\nminimum the cost of maintenance of our military establishment.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year the work of constructing permanent infantry and\r\ncavalry posts has been continued at the places heretofore designated.\r\nThe Secretary of War repeats his recommendation that appropriations for\r\nbarracks and quarters should more strictly conform to the needs of the\r\nservice as judged by the Department rather than respond to the wishes\r\nand importunities of localities. It is imperative that much of the\r\nmoney provided for such construction should now be allotted to the\r\nerection of necessary quarters for the garrisons assigned to the coast\r\ndefenses, where many men will be needed to properly care for and\r\noperate modern guns. It is essential, too, that early provision be made\r\nto supply the necessary force of artillery to meet the demands of this\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nThe entire Army has now been equipped with the new magazine arms, and\r\nwise policy demands that all available public and private resources\r\nshould be so employed as to provide within a reasonable time a\r\nsufficient number to supply the State militia with these modern weapons\r\nand provide an ample reserve for any emergency.\r\n\r\nThe organized militia numbers 112,879 men. The appropriations for its\r\nsupport by the several States approximate $2,800,000 annually, and\r\n$400,000 is contributed by the General Government. Investigation shows\r\nthese troops to be usually well drilled and inspired with much military\r\ninterest, but in many instances they are so deficient in proper arms\r\nand equipment that a sudden call to active duty would find them\r\ninadequately prepared for field service. I therefore recommend that\r\nprompt measures be taken to remedy this condition and that every\r\nencouragement be given to this deserving body of unpaid and voluntary\r\ncitizen soldiers, upon whose assistance we must largely rely in time of\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year rapid progress has been made toward the completion\r\nof the scheme adopted for the erection and armament of fortifications\r\nalong our seacoast, while equal progress has been made in providing the\r\nmaterial for submarine defense in connection with these works.\r\n\r\nIt is peculiarly gratifying at this time to note the great advance that\r\nhas been made in this important undertaking since the date of my annual\r\nmessage to the Fifty-third Congress at the opening of its second\r\nsession, in December, 1893. At that time I informed the Congress of the\r\napproaching completion of nine 12-inch, twenty 10-inch, and thirty-four\r\n8-inch high-power steel guns and seventy-five 12-inch rifled mortars.\r\n\r\nThis total then seemed insignificant when compared with the great work\r\nremaining to be done. Yet it was none the less a source of satisfaction\r\nto every citizen when he reflected that it represented the first\r\ninstallment of the new ordnance of American design and American\r\nmanufacture and demonstrated our ability to supply from our own\r\nresources guns of unexcelled power and accuracy.\r\n\r\nAt that date, however, there were practically no carriages upon which\r\nto mount these guns and only thirty-one emplacements for guns and\r\nsixty-four for mortars. Nor were all these emplacements in condition to\r\nreceive their armament. Only one high-power gun was at that time in\r\nposition for the defense of the entire coast.\r\n\r\nSince that time the number of guns actually completed has been\r\nincreased to a total of twenty-one 12-inch, fifty-six 10-inch,\r\nsixty-one 8-inch high-power breech-loading steel guns, ten rapid-fire\r\nguns, and eighty 12-inch rifled mortars. In addition there are in\r\nprocess of construction one 16-inch-type gun, fifty 12-inch, fifty-six\r\n10-inch, twenty-seven 8-inch high-power guns, and sixty-six 12-inch\r\nrifled mortars; in all, four hundred and twenty-eight guns and mortars.\r\n\r\nDuring the same year, immediately preceding the message referred to,\r\nthe first modern gun carriage had been completed and eleven more were\r\nin process of construction. All but one were of the nondisappearing\r\ntype. These, however, were not such as to secure necessary cover for\r\nthe artillery gunners against the intense fire of modern machine\r\nrapid-fire and high-power guns.\r\n\r\nThe inventive genius of ordnance and civilian experts has been taxed in\r\ndesigning carriages that would obviate this fault, resulting, it is\r\nbelieved, in the solution of this difficult problem. Since 1893 the\r\nnumber of gun carriages constructed or building has been raised to a\r\ntotal of 129, of which 90 are on the disappearing principle, and the\r\nnumber of mortar carriages to 152, while the 95 emplacements which were\r\nprovided for prior to that time have been increased to 280 built and\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nThis improved situation is largely due to the recent generous response\r\nof Congress to the recommendations of the War Department.\r\n\r\nThus we shall soon have complete about one-fifth of the comprehensive\r\nsystem the first step in which was noted in my message to the Congress\r\nof December 4, 1893.\r\n\r\nWhen it is understood that a masonry emplacement not only furnishes a\r\nplatform for the heavy modern high-power gun, but also in every\r\nparticular serves the purpose and takes the place of the fort of former\r\ndays, the importance of the work accomplished is better comprehended.\r\n\r\nIn the hope that the work will be prosecuted with no less vigor in the\r\nfuture, the Secretary of War has submitted an estimate by which, if\r\nallowed, there will be provided and either built or building by the end\r\nof the next fiscal year such additional guns, mortars, gun carriages,\r\nand emplacements as will represent not far from one-third of the total\r\nwork to be done under the plan adopted for our coast defenses, thus\r\naffording a prospect that the entire work will be substantially\r\ncompleted within six years. In less time than that, however, we shall\r\nhave attained a marked degree of security.\r\n\r\nThe experience and results of the past year demonstrate that with a\r\ncontinuation of present careful methods the cost of the remaining work\r\nwill be much less than the original estimate.\r\n\r\nWe should always keep in mind that of all forms of military preparation\r\ncoast defense alone is essentially pacific in its nature. While it\r\ngives the sense of security due to a consciousness of strength, it is\r\nneither the purpose nor the effect of such permanent fortifications to\r\ninvolve us in foreign complications, but rather to guarantee us against\r\nthem. They are not temptation to war, but security against it. Thus\r\nthey are thoroughly in accord with all the traditions of our national\r\ndiplomacy.\r\n\r\nThe Attorney-General presents a detailed and interesting statement of\r\nthe important work done under his supervision during the last fiscal\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe ownership and management by the Government of penitentiaries for\r\nthe confinement of those convicted in United States courts of\r\nviolations of Federal laws, which for many years has been a subject of\r\nExecutive recommendation, have at last to a slight extent been realized\r\nby the utilization of the abandoned military prison at Fort Leavenworth\r\nas a United States penitentiary.\r\n\r\nThis is certainly a movement in the right direction, but it ought to be\r\nat once supplemented by the rebuilding or extensive enlargement of this\r\nimprovised prison and the construction of at least one more, to be\r\nlocated in the Southern States. The capacity of the Leavenworth\r\npenitentiary is so limited that the expense of its maintenance,\r\ncalculated at a per capita rate upon the number of prisoners it can\r\naccommodate, does not make as economical an exhibit as it would if it\r\nwere larger and better adapted to prison purposes; but I am thoroughly\r\nconvinced that economy, humanity, and a proper sense of responsibility\r\nand duty toward those whom we punish for violations of Federal law\r\ndictate that the Federal Government should have the entire control and\r\nmanagement of the penitentiaries where convicted violators are confined.\r\n\r\nIt appears that since the transfer of the Fort Leavenworth Military\r\nPrison to its new uses the work previously done by prisoners confined\r\nthere, and for which expensive machinery has been provided, has been\r\ndiscontinued. This work consisted of the manufacture of articles for\r\narmy use, now done elsewhere. On all grounds it is exceedingly\r\ndesirable that the convicts confined in this penitentiary be allowed to\r\nresume work of this description.\r\n\r\nIt is most gratifying to note the satisfactory results that have\r\nfollowed the inauguration of the new system provided for by the act of\r\nMay 28, 1896, under which certain Federal officials are compensated by\r\nsalaries instead of fees. The new plan was put in operation on the 1st\r\nday of July, 1896, and already the great economy it enforces, its\r\nprevention of abuses, and its tendency to a better enforcement of the\r\nlaws are strikingly apparent. Detailed evidence of the usefulness of\r\nthis long-delayed but now happily accomplished reform will be found\r\nclearly set forth in the Attorney-General's report.\r\n\r\nOur Post-Office Department is in good condition, and the exhibit made\r\nof its operations during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1896, if\r\nallowance is made for imperfections in the laws applicable to it, is\r\nvery satisfactory. The total receipts during the year were\r\n$82,499,208.40. The total expenditures were $90,626,296.84, exclusive\r\nof the $1,559,898.27 which was earned by the Pacific Railroad for\r\ntransportation and credited on their debt to the Government. There was\r\nan increase of receipts over the previous year of $5,516,080.21, or 7.1\r\nper cent, and an increase of expenditures of $3,836,124.02, or 4.42 per\r\ncent. The deficit was $1,679,956.19 less than that of the preceding\r\nyear. The chief expenditures of the postal service are regulated by law\r\nand are not in the control of the Postmaster-General. All that he can\r\naccomplish by the most watchful administration and economy is to\r\nenforce prompt and thorough collection and accounting for public moneys\r\nand such minor savings in small expenditures and in letting those\r\ncontracts, for post-office supplies and star service, which are not\r\nregulated by statute.\r\n\r\nAn effective cooperation between the Auditor's Office and the\r\nPost-Office Department and the making and enforcement of orders by the\r\nDepartment requiring immediate notification to their sureties of all\r\ndelinquencies on the part of postmasters, and compelling such\r\npostmasters to make more frequent deposits of postal funds, have\r\nresulted in a prompter auditing of their accounts and much less default\r\nto the Government than heretofore.\r\n\r\nThe year's report shows large extensions of both star-route service and\r\nrailway mail service, with increased postal facilities. Much higher\r\naccuracy in handling mails has also been reached, as appears by the\r\ndecrease of errors in the railway mail service and the reduction of\r\nmail matter returned to the Dead-Letter Office.\r\n\r\nThe deficit for the last year, although much less than that of the last\r\nand preceding years, emphasizes the necessity for legislation to\r\ncorrect the growing abuse of second-class rates, to which the\r\ndeficiency is mainly attributable. The transmission at the rate of 1\r\ncent a pound of serial libraries, advertising sheets,\" house organs\"\r\n(periodicals advertising some particular \"house\" or institution),\r\nsample copies, and the like ought certainly to be discontinued. A\r\nglance at the revenues received for the work done last year will show\r\nmore plainly than any other statement the gross abuse of the postal\r\nservice and the growing waste of its earnings.\r\n\r\nThe free matter carried in the mails for the Departments, offices,\r\netc., of the Government and for Congress, in pounds, amounted to\r\n94,480,189.\r\n\r\nIf this is offset against buildings for post-offices and stations, the\r\nrental of which would more than compensate for such free postal\r\nservice, we have this exhibit:\r\n\r\n\r\nWeight of mail matter (other than above) transmitted through the mails\r\nfor the year ending June 30, 1896.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Class                                    Weight        Revenue\r\n                                           Pounds\r\n\r\n  1. Domestic and foreign letters and\r\n       postal cards, etc                 65,337,343     $60,624,464\r\n\r\n  2. Newspapers and periodicals,\r\n       1 cent per pound                 348,988,648       2,996,403\r\n\r\n  3. Books, seeds, etc.,\r\n       8 cents a pound                   78,701,148      10,324,069\r\n\r\n  4. Parcels, etc., 16 cents a pound     19,950,187       3,129,321\r\n\r\n  Total                                 512,977,326      77,044,257\r\n\r\nThe remainder of our postal revenue, amounting to something more than\r\n$5,000,000, was derived from box rents, registry fees, money-order\r\nbusiness, and other similar items.\r\n\r\nThe entire expenditures of the Department, including pay for\r\ntransportation credited to the Pacific railroads, were $92,186,195.11,\r\nwhich may be considered as the cost of receiving, carrying, and\r\ndelivering the above mail matter. It thus appears that though the\r\nsecond-class matter constituted more than two-thirds of the total that\r\nwas carried, the revenue derived from it was less than one-thirtieth of\r\nthe total expense.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The average revenue was--\r\n\r\n  From each pound of first-class matter ......... cents    93.0\r\n  From each pound of second class ............... mills     8.5\r\n  From each pound of third class ................ cents    13.1\r\n  From each pound of fourth class ...............  do      15.6\r\n\r\n  Of the second class 52,348,297 was county-free matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe growth in weight of second-class matter has been from 299,000,000\r\npounds in 1894 to 312,000,000 in 1895 and to almost 349,000,000 in\r\n1896, and it is quite evident this increasing drawback is far\r\noutstripping any possible growth of postal revenues.\r\n\r\nOur mail service should of course be such as to meet the wants and even\r\nthe conveniences of our people at a direct charge upon them so light as\r\nperhaps to exclude the idea of our Post-Office Department being a\r\nmoney-making concern; but in the face of a constantly recurring\r\ndeficiency in its revenues and in view of the fact that we supply the\r\nbest mail service in the world it seems to me it is quite time to\r\ncorrect the abuses that swell enormously our annual deficit. If we\r\nconcede the public policy of carrying weekly newspapers free in the\r\ncounty of publication, and even the policy of carrying at less than\r\none-tenth of their cost other bona fide newspapers and periodicals,\r\nthere can be no excuse for subjecting the service to the further\r\nimmense and increasing loss involved in carrying at the nominal rate of\r\n1 cent a pound the serial libraries, sometimes including trashy and\r\neven harmful literature, and other matter which under the loose\r\ninterpretation of a loose statute have been gradually given\r\nsecond-class rates, thus absorbing all profitable returns derived from\r\nfirst-class matter, which pays three or four times more than its cost,\r\nand producing a large annual loss to be paid by general taxation. If\r\nsuch second-class matter paid merely the cost of its handling, our\r\ndeficit would disappear and a surplus result which might be used to\r\ngive the people still better mail facilities or cheaper rates of letter\r\npostage. I recommend that legislation be at once enacted to correct\r\nthese abuses and introduce better business ideas in the regulation of\r\nour postal rates.\r\n\r\nExperience and observation have demonstrated that certain improvements\r\nin the organization of the Post-Office Department must be secured\r\nbefore we can gain the full benefit of the immense sums expended in its\r\nadministration. This involves the following reforms, which I earnestly\r\nrecommend:\r\n\r\nThere should be a small addition to the existing inspector service, to\r\nbe employed in the supervision of the carrier force, which now numbers\r\n13,000 men and performs its service practically without the\r\nsurveillance exercised over all other branches of the postal or public\r\nservice. Of course such a lack of supervision and freedom from\r\nwholesome disciplinary restraints must inevitably lead to imperfect\r\nservice. There should also be appointed a few inspectors who could\r\nassist the central office in necessary investigation concerning matters\r\nof post-office leases, post-office sites, allowances for rent, fuel,\r\nand lights, and in organizing and securing the best results from the\r\nwork of the 14,000 clerks now employed in first and second class\r\noffices.\r\n\r\nI am convinced that the small expense attending the inauguration of\r\nthese reforms would actually be a profitable investment.\r\n\r\nI especially recommend such a recasting of the appropriations by\r\nCongress for the Post-Office Department as will permit the\r\nPostmaster-General to proceed with the work of consolidating\r\npost-offices. This work has already been entered upon sufficiently to\r\nfully demonstrate by experiment and experience that such consolidation\r\nis productive of better service, larger revenues, and less\r\nexpenditures, to say nothing of the further advantage of gradually\r\nwithdrawing post-offices from the spoils system.\r\n\r\nThe Universal Postal Union, which now embraces all the civilized world\r\nand whose delegates will represent 1,000,000,000 people, will hold its\r\nfifth congress in the city of Washington in May, 1897. The United\r\nStates may be said to have taken the initiative which led to the first\r\nmeeting of this congress, at Berne in 1874, and the formation of the\r\nUniversal Postal Union, which brings the postal service of all\r\ncountries to every man's neighborhood and has wrought marvels in\r\ncheapening postal rates and securing absolutely safe mail communication\r\nthroughout the world. Previous congresses have met in Berne, Paris,\r\nLisbon, and Vienna, and the respective countries in which they have\r\nassembled have made generous provision for their accommodation and for\r\nthe reception and entertainment of the delegates.\r\n\r\nIn view of the importance of this assemblage and of its deliberations\r\nand of the honors and hospitalities accorded to our representatives by\r\nother countries on similar occasions, I earnestly hope that such an\r\nappropriation will be made for the expenses necessarily attendant upon\r\nthe coming meeting in our capital city as will be worthy of our\r\nnational hospitality and indicative of our appreciation of the event.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Navy Department and its present condition are fully\r\nexhibited in the report of the Secretary.\r\n\r\nThe construction of vessels for our new Navy has been energetically\r\nprosecuted by the present Administration upon the general lines\r\npreviously adopted, the Department having seen no necessity for radical\r\nchanges in prior methods, under which the work was found to be\r\nprogressing in a manner highly satisfactory. It has been decided,\r\nhowever, to provide in every shipbuilding contract that the builder\r\nshould pay all trial expenses, and it has also been determined to pay\r\nno speed premiums in future contracts. The premiums recently earned and\r\nsome yet to be decided are features of the contracts made before this\r\nconclusion was reached.\r\n\r\nOn March 4, 1893, there were in commission but two armored vessels--the\r\ndouble-turreted monitors Miantonomoh and Monterey. Since that date, of\r\nvessels theretofore authorized, there have been placed in their first\r\ncommission 3 first-class and 2 second-class battle ships, 2 armored\r\ncruisers, 1 harbor-defense ram, and 5 double-turreted monitors,\r\nincluding the Maine and the Puritan, just completed. Eight new\r\nunarmored cruisers and 2 new gunboats have also been commissioned. The\r\nIowa, another battle ship, will be completed about March 1, and at\r\nleast 4 more gunboats will be ready for sea in the early spring.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to state that our ships and their outfits are believed\r\nto be equal to the best that can be manufactured elsewhere, and that\r\nsuch notable reductions have been made in their cost as to justify the\r\nstatement that quite a number of vessels are now being constructed at\r\nrates as low as those that prevail in European shipyards.\r\n\r\nOur manufacturing facilities are at this time ample for all possible\r\nnaval contingencies. Three of our Government navy-yards--those at Mare\r\nIsland, Cal., Norfolk, Va., and Brooklyn, N. Y.--are equipped for\r\nshipbuilding, our ordnance plant in Washington is equal to any in the\r\nworld, and at the torpedo station we are successfully making the\r\nhighest grades of smokeless powder. The first-class private shipyards\r\nat Newport News, Philadelphia, and San Francisco are building battle\r\nships; eleven contractors, situated in the States of Maine, Rhode\r\nIsland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, and the State of\r\nWashington, are constructing gunboats or torpedo boats; two plants are\r\nmanufacturing large quantities of first-class armor, and American\r\nfactories are producing automobile torpedoes, powder, projectiles,\r\nrapid-fire guns, and everything else necessary for the complete outfit\r\nof naval vessels.\r\n\r\nThere have been authorized by Congress since March, 1893, 5 battle\r\nships, 6 light-draft gunboats, 16 torpedo boats, and 1 submarine\r\ntorpedo boat. Contracts for the building of all of them have been let.\r\nThe Secretary expresses the opinion that we have for the present a\r\nsufficient supply of cruisers and gunboats, and that hereafter the\r\nconstruction of battle ships and torpedo boats will supply our needs.\r\n\r\nMuch attention has been given to the methods of carrying on\r\ndepartmental business. Important modifications in the regulations have\r\nbeen made, tending to unify the control of shipbuilding as far as may\r\nbe under the Bureau of Construction and Repair, and also to improve the\r\nmode of purchasing supplies for the Navy by the Bureau of Supplies and\r\nAccounts. The establishment under recent acts of Congress of a supply\r\nfund with which to purchase these supplies in large quantities and\r\nother modifications of methods have tended materially to their\r\ncheapening and better quality.\r\n\r\nThe War College has developed into an institution which it is believed\r\nwill be of great value to the Navy in teaching the science of war, as\r\nwell as in stimulating professional zeal in the Navy, and it will be\r\nespecially useful in the devising of plans for the utilization in case\r\nof necessity of all the naval resources of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary has persistently adhered to the plan he found in\r\noperation for securing labor at navy-yards through boards of labor\r\nemployment, and has done much to make it more complete and efficient.\r\nThe naval officers who are familiar with this system and its operation\r\nexpress the decided opinion that its results have been to vastly\r\nimprove the character of the work done at our yards and greatly reduce\r\nits cost.\r\n\r\nDiscipline among the officers and men of the Navy has been maintained\r\nto a high standard and the percentage of American citizens enlisted has\r\nbeen very much increased.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary is considering and will formulate during the coming\r\nwinter a plan for laying up ships in reserve, thereby largely reducing\r\nthe cost of maintaining our vessels afloat. This plan contemplates that\r\nbattle ships, torpedo boats, and such of the cruisers as are not needed\r\nfor active service at sea shall be kept in reserve with skeleton crews\r\non board to keep them in condition, cruising only enough to insure the\r\nefficiency of the ships and their crews in time of activity.\r\n\r\nThe economy to result from this system is too obvious to need comment.\r\n\r\nThe Naval Militia, which was authorized a few years ago as an\r\nexperiment, has now developed into a body of enterprising young men,\r\nactive and energetic in the discharge of their duties and promising\r\ngreat usefulness. This establishment has nearly the same relation to\r\nour Navy as the National Guard in the different States bears to our\r\nArmy, and it constitutes a source of supply for our naval forces the\r\nimportance of which is immediately apparent.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Interior presents a comprehensive\r\nand interesting exhibit of the numerous and important affairs committed\r\nto his supervision. It is impossible in this communication to do more\r\nthan briefly refer to a few of the subjects concerning which the\r\nSecretary gives full and instructive information.\r\n\r\nThe money appropriated on account of this Department and for its\r\ndisbursement for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1896, amounted to more\r\nthan $157,000,000, or a greater sum than was appropriated for the\r\nentire maintenance of the Government for the two fiscal years ended\r\nJune 30, 1861.\r\n\r\nOur public lands, originally amounting to 1,840,000,000 acres, have\r\nbeen so reduced that only about 600,000,000 acres still remain in\r\nGovernment control, excluding Alaska. The balance, being by far the\r\nmost valuable portion, has been given away to settlers, to new States,\r\nand to railroads or sold at a comparatively nominal sum. The patenting\r\nof land in execution of railroad grants has progressed rapidly during\r\nthe year, and since the 4th day of March, 1893, about 25,000,000 acres\r\nhave thus been conveyed to these corporations.\r\n\r\nI agree with the Secretary that the remainder of our public lands\r\nshould be more carefully dealt with and their alienation guarded by\r\nbetter economy and greater prudence.\r\n\r\nThe commission appointed from the membership of the National Academy of\r\nSciences, provided for by an act of Congress, to formulate plans for a\r\nnational forestry system will, it is hoped, soon be prepared to present\r\nthe result of thorough and intelligent examination of this important\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThe total Indian population of the United States is 177,235, according\r\nto a census made in 1895, exclusive of those within the State of New\r\nYork and those comprising the Five Civilized Tribes. Of this number\r\nthere are approximately 38,000 children of school age. During the year\r\n23,393 of these were enrolled in schools. The progress which has\r\nattended recent efforts to extend Indian-school facilities and the\r\nanticipation of continued liberal appropriations to that end can not\r\nfail to afford the utmost satisfaction to those who believe that the\r\neducation of Indian children is a prime factor in the accomplishment of\r\nIndian civilization.\r\n\r\nIt may be said in general terms that in every particular the\r\nimprovement of the Indians under Government care has been most marked\r\nand encouraging.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, and the agents\r\nhaving charge of Indians to whom allotments have been made strongly\r\nurge the passage of a law prohibiting the sale of liquor to allottees\r\nwho have taken their lands in severalty. I earnestly join in this\r\nrecommendation and venture to express the hope that the Indian may be\r\nspeedily protected against this greatest of all obstacles to his\r\nwell-being and advancement.\r\n\r\nThe condition of affairs among the Five Civilized Tribes, who occupy\r\nlarge tracts of land in the Indian Territory and who have governments\r\nof their own, has assumed such an aspect as to render it almost\r\nindispensable that there should be an entire change in the relations of\r\nthese Indians to the General Government. This seems to be necessary in\r\nfurtherance of their own interests, as well as for the protection of\r\nnon-Indian residents in their territory. A commission organized and\r\nempowered under several recent laws is now negotiating with these\r\nIndians for the relinquishment of their courts and the division of\r\ntheir common lands in severalty and are aiding in the settlement of the\r\ntroublesome question of tribal membership. The reception of their first\r\nproffers of negotiation was not encouraging, but through patience and\r\nsuch conduct on their part as demonstrated that their intentions were\r\nfriendly and in the interest of the tribes the prospect of success has\r\nbecome more promising. The effort should be to save these Indians from\r\nthe consequences of their own mistakes and improvidence and to secure\r\nto the real Indian his rights as against intruders and professed\r\nfriends who profit by his retrogression. A change is also needed to\r\nprotect life and property through the operation of courts conducted\r\naccording to strict justice and strong enough to enforce their mandates.\r\n\r\nAs a sincere friend of the Indian, I am exceedingly anxious that these\r\nreforms should be accomplished with the consent and aid of the tribes\r\nand that no necessity may be presented for radical or drastic\r\nlegislation I hope, therefore, that the commission now conducting\r\nnegotiations will soon be able to report that progress has been made\r\ntoward a friendly adjustment of existing difficulties.\r\n\r\nIt appears that a very valuable deposit of gilsonite or asphaltum has\r\nbeen found on the reservation in Utah occupied by the Uncompahgre Ute\r\nIndians. Every consideration of care for the public interest and every\r\nsensible business reason dictate such management or disposal of this\r\nimportant source of public revenue as will except it from the general\r\nrules and incidents attending the ordinary disposition of public lands\r\nand secure to the Government a fair share at least of its advantages in\r\nplace of its transfer for a nominal sum to interested individuals.\r\n\r\nI indorse the recommendation made by the present Secretary of the\r\nInterior, as well as his predecessor, that a permanent commission,\r\nconsisting of three members, one of whom shall be an army officer, be\r\ncreated to perform the duties now devolving upon the Commissioner and\r\nAssistant Commissioner of Indian Affairs. The management of the Bureau\r\ninvolves such numerous and diverse details and the advantages of an\r\nuninterrupted policy are so apparent that I hope the change suggested\r\nwill meet the approval of the Congress.\r\n\r\nThe diminution of our enormous pension roll and the decrease of pension\r\nexpenditure, which have been so often confidently for told, still fail\r\nin material realization. The number of pensioners on the polls at the\r\nclose of the fiscal year ended June 30, 1896, was 970,678. This is the\r\nlargest number ever reported. The amount paid exclusively for pensions\r\nduring the year was $138,214,761.94, a slight decrease from that of the\r\npreceding year, while the total expenditures on account of pensions,\r\nincluding the cost of maintaining the Department and expenses attending\r\npension distribution, amounted to $142,206,550.59, or within every\r\nsmall fraction of one-third of the entire expense of supporting the\r\nGovernment during the same year. The number of new pension certificates\r\nissued was 90,640. Of these, 40,374 represent original allowances of\r\nclaims and 15,878 increases of existing pensions.\r\n\r\nThe number of persons receiving pensions from the United States, but\r\nresiding in foreign countries, at the close of the last fiscal year was\r\n3,781, and the amount paid to them during the year was $582,735.38.\r\n\r\nThe sum appropriated for the payment of pensions for the current fiscal\r\nyear, ending June 30, 1897, is $140,000,000, and for the succeeding\r\nyear it is estimated that the same amount will be necessary.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner of Pensions reports that during the last fiscal year\r\n339 indictments were found against violators of the pension laws. Upon\r\nthese indictments 167 convictions resulted.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, based upon such statements as these and much other\r\ninformation and observation, the abuses which have been allowed to\r\ncreep into our pension system have done incalculable harm in\r\ndemoralizing our people and undermining good citizenship. I have\r\nendeavored within my sphere of official duty to protect our pension\r\nroll and make it what it should be, a roll of honor, containing the\r\nnames of those disabled in their country's service and worthy of their\r\ncountry's affectionate remembrance. When I have seen those who pose as\r\nthe soldiers' friends active and alert in urging greater laxity and\r\nmore reckless pension expenditure, while nursing selfish schemes, I\r\nhave deprecated the approach of a situation when necessary retrenchment\r\nand enforced economy may lead to an attack upon pension abuses so\r\ndetermined as to overlook the discrimination due to those who, worthy\r\nof a nation's care, ought to live and die under the protection of a\r\nnation's gratitude.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary calls attention to the public interests involved in an\r\nadjustment of the obligations of the Pacific railroads to the\r\nGovernment. I deem it to be an important duty to especially present\r\nthis subject to the consideration of the Congress.\r\n\r\nOn January 1, 1897, with the amount already matured, more than\r\n$13,000,000 of the principal of the subsidy bonds issued by the United\r\nStates in aid of the construction of the Union Pacific Railway,\r\nincluding its Kansas line, and more than $6,000,000 of like bonds\r\nissued in aid of the Central Pacific Railroad, including those issued\r\nto the Western Pacific Railroad Company, will have fallen due and been\r\npaid or must on that day be paid by the Government. Without any\r\nreference to the application of the sinking fund now in the Treasury,\r\nthis will create such a default on the part of these companies to the\r\nGovernment as will give it the right to at once institute proceedings\r\nto foreclose its mortgage lien. In addition to this indebtedness, which\r\nwill be due January 1, 1897, there will mature between that date and\r\nJanuary 1, 1899, the remaining principal of such subsidy bonds, which\r\nmust also be met by the Government. These amount to more than\r\n$20,000,000 on account of the Union Pacific lines and exceed\r\n$21,000,000 on account of the Central Pacific lines.\r\n\r\nThe situation of these roads and the condition of their indebtedness to\r\nthe Government have been fully set forth in the reports of various\r\ncommittees to the present and prior Congresses, and as early as 1887\r\nthey were thoroughly examined by a special commission appointed\r\npursuant to an act of Congress. The considerations requiring an\r\nadjustment of the Government's relations to the companies have been\r\nclearly presented and the conclusion reached with practical uniformity\r\nthat if these relations are not terminated they should be revised upon\r\na basis securing their safe continuance.\r\n\r\nUnder section 4 of the act of Congress passed March 3, 1887, the\r\nPresident is charged with the duty, in the event that any mortgage or\r\nother incumbrance paramount to the interest of the United States in the\r\nproperty of the Pacific railroads should exist and be lawfully liable\r\nto be enforced, to direct the action of the Departments of Treasury and\r\nof justice in the protection of the interest of the United States by\r\nredemption or through judicial proceedings, including foreclosures of\r\nthe Government liens.\r\n\r\nIn view of the fact that the Congress has for a number of years almost\r\nconstantly had under consideration various plans for dealing with the\r\nconditions existing between these roads and the Government, I have thus\r\nfar felt justified in withholding action under the statute above\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the Union Pacific Company, however, the situation has\r\nbecome especially and immediately urgent. Proceedings have been\r\ninstituted to foreclose a first mortgage upon those aided parts of the\r\nmain lines upon which the Government holds a second and subordinate\r\nmortgage lien. In consequence of those proceedings and increasing\r\ncomplications, added to the default occurring on the 1st day of\r\nJanuary, 1897, a condition will be presented at that date, so far as\r\nthis company is concerned, that must emphasize the mandate of the act\r\nof 1887 and give to Executive duty under its provisions a more\r\nimperative aspect. Therefore, unless Congress shall otherwise direct or\r\nshall have previously determined upon a different solution of the\r\nproblem, there will hardly appear to exist any reason for delaying\r\nbeyond the date of the default above mentioned such Executive action as\r\nwill promise to subserve the public interests and save the Government\r\nfrom the loss threatened by further inaction.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Agriculture is so intimately related to the welfare\r\nof our people and the prosperity of our nation that it should\r\nconstantly receive the care and encouragement of the Government. From\r\nsmall beginnings it has grown to be the center of agricultural\r\nintelligence and the source of aid and encouragement to agricultural\r\nefforts. Large sums of money are annually appropriated for the\r\nmaintenance of this Department, and it must be confessed that the\r\nlegislation relating to it has not always been directly in the interest\r\nof practical farming or properly guarded against waste and\r\nextravagance. So far, however, as public money has been appropriated\r\nfairly and sensibly to help those who actually till the soil, no\r\nexpenditure has been more profitably made or more generally approved by\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nUnder the present management of the Department its usefulness has been\r\nenhanced in every direction, and at the same time strict economy has\r\nbeen enforced to the utmost extent permitted by Congressional action.\r\nFrom the report of the Secretary it appears that through careful and\r\nprudent financial management he has annually saved a large sum from his\r\nappropriations, aggregating during his incumbency and up to the close\r\nof the present fiscal year nearly one-fifth of the entire amount\r\nappropriated. These results have been accomplished by a conscientious\r\nstudy of the real needs of the farmer and such a regard for economy as\r\nthe genuine farmer ought to appreciate, supplemented by a rigid\r\nadherence to civil-service methods in a Department which should be\r\nconducted in the interest of agriculture instead of partisan politics.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary reports that the value of our exports of farm products\r\nduring the last fiscal year amounted to $570,000,000, an increase of\r\n$17,000,000 over those of the year immediately preceding. This\r\nstatement is not the less welcome because of the fact that,\r\nnotwithstanding such increase, the proportion of exported agricultural\r\nproducts to our total exports of all descriptions fell off during the\r\nyear. The benefits of an increase in agricultural exports being\r\nassured, the decrease in its proportion to our total exports is the\r\nmore gratifying when we consider that it is owing to the fact that such\r\ntotal exports for the year increased more than $75,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe large and increasing exportation of our agricultural products\r\nsuggests the great usefulness of the organization lately established in\r\nthe Department for the purpose of giving to those engaged in farming\r\npursuits reliable information concerning the condition, needs, and\r\nadvantages of different foreign markets. Inasmuch as the success of the\r\nfarmer depends upon the advantageous sale of his products, and inasmuch\r\nas foreign markets must largely be the destination of such products, it\r\nis quite apparent that a knowledge of the conditions and wants that\r\naffect those markets ought to result in sowing more intelligently and\r\nreaping with a better promise of profit. Such information points out\r\nthe way to a prudent foresight in the selection and cultivation of\r\ncrops and to a release from the bondage of unreasoning monotony of\r\nproduction, a glutted and depressed market, and constantly recurring\r\nunprofitable toil.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion the gratuitous distribution of seeds by the Department as\r\nat present conducted ought to be discontinued. No one can read the\r\nstatement of the Secretary on this subject and doubt the extravagance\r\nand questionable results of this practice. The professed friends of the\r\nfarmer, and certainly the farmers themselves, are naturally expected to\r\nbe willing to rid a Department devoted to the promotion of farming\r\ninterests of a feature which tends so much to its discredit.\r\n\r\nThe Weather Bureau, now attached to the Department of Agriculture, has\r\ncontinued to extend its sphere of usefulness, and by an uninterrupted\r\nimprovement in the accuracy of its forecasts has greatly increased its\r\nefficiency as an aid and protection to all whose occupations are\r\nrelated to weather conditions.\r\n\r\nOmitting further reference to the operations of the Department, I\r\ncommend the Secretary's report and the suggestions it contains to the\r\ncareful consideration of the Congress.\r\n\r\nThe progress made in civil-service reform furnishes a cause for the\r\nutmost congratulation. It has survived the doubts of its friends as\r\nwell as the rancor of its enemies and has gained a permanent place\r\namong the agencies destined to cleanse our politics and to improve,\r\neconomize, and elevate the public service.\r\n\r\nThere are now in the competitive classified service upward of 84,000\r\nplaces, more than half of these having been included from time to time\r\nsince March 4, 1893. A most radical and sweeping extension was made by\r\nExecutive order dated the 6th day of May, 1896, and if fourth-class\r\npostmasterships are not included in the statement it may be said that\r\npractically all positions contemplated by the civil-service law are now\r\nclassified. Abundant reasons exist for including these\r\npostmaster-ships, based upon economy, improved service, and the peace\r\nand quiet of neighborhoods. If, however, obstacles prevent such action\r\nat present, I earnestly hope that Congress will, without increasing\r\npost-office appropriations, so adjust them as to permit in proper eases\r\na consolidation of these post-offices, to the end that through this\r\nprocess the result desired may to a limited extent be accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe civil-service rules as amended during the last year provide for a\r\nsensible and uniform method of promotion, basing eligibility to better\r\npositions upon demonstrated efficiency and faithfulness. The absence of\r\nfixed rules on this subject has been an infirmity in the system more\r\nand more apparent as its other benefits have been better appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of civil-service methods in their business aspects are\r\ntoo well understood to require argument. Their application has become a\r\nnecessity to the executive work of the Government. But those who gain\r\npositions through the operation of these methods should be made to\r\nunderstand that the nonpartisan scheme through which they receive their\r\nappointments demands from them by way of reciprocity nonpartisan and\r\nfaithful performance of duty under every Administration and cheerful\r\nfidelity to every chief. While they should be encouraged to decently\r\nexercise their rights of citizenship and to support through their\r\nsuffrages the political beliefs they honestly profess, the noisy,\r\npestilent, and partisan employee, who loves political turmoil and\r\ncontention or who renders lax and grudging service to an Administration\r\nnot representing his political views, should be promptly and fearlessly\r\ndealt with in such a way as to furnish a warning to others who may be\r\nlikewise disposed.\r\n\r\nThe annual report of the Commissioners will be duly transmitted, and I\r\ncommend the important matter they have in charge to the careful\r\nconsideration of the Congress.\r\n\r\nThe Interstate Commerce Commission has during the last year supplied\r\nabundant evidence of its usefulness and the importance of the work\r\ncommitted to its charge.\r\n\r\nPublic transportation is a universal necessity, and the question of\r\njust and reasonable charges therefor has become of vital importance not\r\nonly to shippers and carriers, but also to the vast multitude of\r\nproducers and consumers. The justice and equity of the principles\r\nembodied in the existing law passed for the purpose of regulating these\r\ncharges are everywhere conceded, and there appears to be no question\r\nthat the policy thus entered upon has a permanent place in our\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nAs the present statute when enacted was in the nature of the case more\r\nor less tentative and experimental, it was hardly expected to supply a\r\ncomplete and adequate system. While its wholesome effects are manifest\r\nand have amply justified its enactment, it is evident that all desired\r\nreforms in transportation methods have not been fully accomplished. In\r\nview of the judicial interpretation which some provisions of this\r\nstatute have received and the defects disclosed by the efforts made for\r\nits enforcement, its revision and amendment appear to be essential, to\r\nthe end that it may more effectually reach the evils designed to be\r\ncorrected. I hope the recommendations of the Commission upon this\r\nsubject will be promptly and favorably considered by the Congress.\r\n\r\nI desire to recur to the statements elsewhere made concerning the\r\nGovernment's receipts and expenditures for the purpose of venturing\r\nupon some suggestions touching our present tariff law and its operation.\r\n\r\nThis statute took effect on the 28th day of August, 1894. Whatever may\r\nbe its shortcomings as a complete measure of tariff reform, it must be\r\nconceded that it has opened the way to a freer and greater exchange of\r\ncommodities between us and other countries, and thus furnished a wider\r\nmarket for our products and manufactures.\r\n\r\nThe only entire fiscal year during which this law has been in force\r\nended on the 30th day of June, 1896. In that year our imports increased\r\nover those of the previous year more than $6,500,000, while the value\r\nof the domestic products we exported and which found markets abroad was\r\nnearly $70,000,000 more than during the preceding year.\r\n\r\nThose who insist that the cost to our people of articles coming to them\r\nfrom abroad for their needful use should only be increased through\r\ntariff charges to an extent necessary to meet the expenses of the\r\nGovernment, as well as those who claim that tariff charges may be laid\r\nupon such articles beyond the necessities of Government revenue and\r\nwith the additional purpose of so increasing their price in our markets\r\nas to give American manufacturers and producers better and more\r\nprofitable opportunities, must agree that our tariff laws are only\r\nprimarily justified as sources of revenue to enable the Government to\r\nmeet the necessary expenses of its maintenance. Considered as to its\r\nefficiency in this aspect, the present law can by no means fall under\r\njust condemnation. During the only complete fiscal year of its\r\noperation it has yielded nearly $8,000,000 more revenue than was\r\nreceived from tariff duties in the preceding year. There was,\r\nnevertheless, a deficit between our receipts and expenditures of a\r\nlittle more than $25,000,000 This, however, was not unexpected.\r\n\r\nThe situation was such in December last, seven months before the close\r\nof the fiscal year, that the Secretary of the Treasury foretold a\r\ndeficiency of $17,000,000. The great and increasing apprehension and\r\ntimidity in business circles and the depression in all activities\r\nintervening since that time, resulting from causes perfectly well\r\nunderstood and entirely disconnected with our tariff law or its\r\noperation, seriously checked the imports we would have otherwise\r\nreceived and readily account for the difference between this estimate\r\nof the Secretary and the actual deficiency, as well as for a continued\r\ndeficit. Indeed, it must be confessed that we could hardly have had a\r\nmore unfavorable period than the last two years for the collection of\r\ntariff revenue. We can not reasonably hope that our recuperation from\r\nthis business depression will be sudden, but it has already set in with\r\na promise of acceleration and continuance.\r\n\r\nI believe our present tariff law, if allowed a fair opportunity, will\r\nin the near future yield a revenue which, with reasonably economical\r\nexpenditures, will overcome all deficiencies. In the meantime no\r\ndeficit that has occurred or may occur need excite or disturb us. To\r\nmeet any such deficit we have in the Treasury in addition to a gold\r\nreserve of one hundred millions a surplus of more than $128,000,000\r\napplicable to the payment of the expenses of the Government, and which\r\nmust, unless expended for that purpose, remain a useless hoard, or, if\r\nnot extravagantly wasted, must in any event be perverted from the\r\npurpose of its exaction from our people. The payment, therefore, of any\r\ndeficiency in the revenue from this fund is nothing more than its\r\nproper and legitimate use. The Government thus applying a surplus\r\nfortunately in its Treasury to the payment of expenses not met by its\r\ncurrent revenues is not at all to be likened to a man living beyond his\r\nincome and thus incurring debt or encroaching on his principal.\r\n\r\nIt is not one of the functions of our Government to accumulate and make\r\nadditions to a fund not needed for immediate expenditure. With\r\nindividuals it is the chief object of struggle and effort. The\r\napplication of an accumulated fund by the Government to the payment of\r\nits running expenses is a duty. An individual living beyond his income\r\nand embarrassing himself with debt or drawing upon his accumulated fund\r\nof principal is either unfortunate or improvident. The distinction is\r\nbetween a government charged with the duty of expending for the benefit\r\nof the people and for proper purposes all the money it receives from\r\nany source, and the individual, who is expected to manifest a natural\r\ndesire to avoid debt or to accumulate as much as possible and to live\r\nwithin the income derived from such accumulations, to the end that they\r\nmay be increased or at least remain unimpaired for the future use and\r\nenjoyment of himself or the objects of his love and affection who may\r\nsurvive him.\r\n\r\nIt is immeasurably better to appropriate our surplus to the payment of\r\njustifiable expenses than to allow it to become an invitation to\r\nreckless appropriations and extravagant expenditures.\r\n\r\nI suppose it will not be denied that under the present law our people\r\nobtain the necessaries of a comfortable existence at a cheaper rate\r\nthan formerly. This is a matter of supreme importance, since it is the\r\npalpable duty of every just government to make the burdens of taxation\r\nas light as possible. The people should not be required to relinquish\r\nthis privilege of cheaper living except under the stress of their\r\nGovernment's necessity made plainly manifest.\r\n\r\nThis reference to the condition and prospects of our revenues naturally\r\nsuggests an allusion to the weakness and vices of our financial\r\nmethods. They have been frequently pressed upon the attention of\r\nCongress in previous Executive communications and the inevitable danger\r\nof their continued toleration pointed out. Without now repeating these\r\ndetails, I can not refrain from again earnestly presenting the\r\nnecessity of the prompt reform of a system opposed to every rule of\r\nsound finance and shown by experience to be fraught with the gravest\r\nperil and perplexity. The terrible Civil War, which shook the\r\nfoundations of our Government more than thirty years ago, brought in\r\nits train the destruction of property, the wasting of our country's\r\nsubstance, and the estrangement of brethren. These are now past and\r\nforgotten. Even the distressing loss of life the conflict entailed is\r\nbut a sacred memory which fosters patriotic sentiment and keeps alive a\r\ntender regard for those who nobly died. And yet there remains with us\r\nto-day in full strength and activity, as an incident of that tremendous\r\nstruggle, a feature of its financial necessities not only unsuited to\r\nour present circumstances, but manifestly a disturbing menace to\r\nbusiness security and an ever-present agent of monetary distress.\r\n\r\nBecause we may be enjoying a temporary relief from its depressing\r\ninfluence, this should not lull us into a false security nor lead us to\r\nforget the suddenness of past visitations.\r\n\r\nI am more convinced than ever that we can have no assured financial\r\npeace and safety until the Government currency obligations upon which\r\ngold may be demanded from the Treasury are withdrawn from circulation\r\nand canceled. This might be done, as has been heretofore recommended,\r\nby their exchange for long-term bonds bearing a low rate of interest or\r\nby their redemption with the proceeds of such bonds. Even if only the\r\nUnited States notes known as greenbacks were thus retired it is\r\nprobable that the Treasury notes issued in payment of silver purchases\r\nunder the act of July 14, 1890, now paid in gold when demanded, would\r\nnot create much disturbance, as they might from time to time, when\r\nreceived in the Treasury by redemption in gold or otherwise, be\r\ngradually and prudently replaced by silver coin.\r\n\r\nThis plan of issuing bonds for the purpose of redemption certainly\r\nappears to be the most effective and direct path to the needed reform.\r\nIn default of this, however, it would be a step in the right direction\r\nif currency obligations redeemable in gold whenever so redeemed should\r\nbe canceled instead of being reissued. This operation would be a slow\r\nremedy, but it would improve present conditions.\r\n\r\nNational banks should redeem their own notes. They should be allowed to\r\nissue circulation to the par value of bonds deposited as security for\r\nits redemption and the tax on their circulation should be reduced to\r\none-fourth of 1 per cent.\r\n\r\nIn considering projects for the retirement of United States notes and\r\nTreasury notes issued under the law of 1890, I am of the opinion that\r\nwe have placed too much stress upon the danger of contracting the\r\ncurrency and have calculated too little upon the gold that would be\r\nadded to our circulation if invited to us by better and safer financial\r\nmethods. It is not so much a contraction of our currency that should be\r\navoided as its unequal distribution.\r\n\r\nThis might be obviated and any fear of harmful contraction at the same\r\ntime removed by allowing the organization of smaller banks and in less\r\npopulous communities than are now permitted, and also authorizing\r\nexisting banks to establish branches in small communities under proper\r\nrestrictions.\r\n\r\nThe entire case may be presented by the statement that the day of\r\nsensible and sound financial methods will not dawn upon us until our\r\nGovernment abandons the banking business and the accumulation of funds\r\nand confines its monetary operations to the receipt of the money\r\ncontributed by the people for its support and to the expenditure of\r\nsuch money for the people's benefit.\r\n\r\nOur business interests and all good citizens long for rest from\r\nfeverish agitation and the inauguration by the Government of a reformed\r\nfinancial policy which will encourage enterprise and make certain the\r\nrewards of labor and industry.\r\n\r\nAnother topic in which our people rightfully take a deep interest may\r\nbe here briefly considered. I refer to the existence of trusts and\r\nother huge aggregations of capital the object of which is to secure the\r\nmonopoly of some particular branch of trade, industry, or commerce and\r\nto stifle wholesome competition. When these are defended, it is usually\r\non the ground that though they increase profits they also reduce\r\nprices, and thus may benefit the public. It must be remembered,\r\nhowever, that a reduction of prices to the people is not one of the\r\nreal objects of these organizations, nor is their tendency necessarily\r\nin that direction. If it occurs in a particular case it is only because\r\nit accords with the purposes or interests of those managing the scheme.\r\n\r\nSuch occasional results fall far short of compensating the palpable\r\nevils charged to the account of trusts and monopolies. Their tendency\r\nis to crush out individual independence and to hinder or prevent the\r\nfree use of human faculties and the full development of human\r\ncharacter. Through them the farmer, the artisan, and the small trader\r\nis in danger of dislodgment from the proud position of being his own\r\nmaster, watchful of all that touches his country's prosperity, in which\r\nhe has an individual lot, and interested in all that affects the\r\nadvantages of business of which he is a factor, to be relegated to the\r\nlevel of a mere appurtenance to a great machine, with little free will,\r\nwith no duty but that of passive obedience, and with little hope or\r\nopportunity of rising in the scale of responsible and helpful\r\ncitizenship.\r\n\r\nTo the instinctive belief that such is the inevitable trend of trusts\r\nand monopolies is due the widespread and deep-seated popular aversion\r\nin which they are held and the not unreasonable insistence that,\r\nwhatever may be their incidental economic advantages, their general\r\neffect upon personal character, prospects, and usefulness can not be\r\notherwise than injurious.\r\n\r\nThough Congress has attempted to deal with this matter by legislation,\r\nthe laws passed for that purpose thus far have proved ineffective, not\r\nbecause of any lack of disposition or attempt to enforce them, but\r\nsimply because the laws themselves as interpreted by the courts do not\r\nreach the difficulty. If the insufficiencies of existing laws can be\r\nremedied by further legislation, it should be done. The fact must be\r\nrecognized, however, that all Federal legislation on this subject may\r\nfall short of its purpose because of inherent obstacles and also\r\nbecause of the complex character of our governmental system, which,\r\nwhile making the Federal authority supreme within its sphere, has\r\ncarefully limited that sphere by metes and bounds that can not be\r\ntransgressed. The decision of our highest court on this precise\r\nquestion renders it quite doubtful whether the evils of trusts and\r\nmonopolies can be adequately treated through Federal action unless they\r\nseek directly and purposely to include in their objects transportation\r\nor intercourse between States or between the United States and foreign\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nIt does not follow, however, that this is the limit of the remedy that\r\nmay be applied. Even though it may be found that Federal authority is\r\nnot broad enough to fully reach the case, there can be no doubt of the\r\npower of the several States to act effectively in the premises, and\r\nthere should be no reason to doubt their willingness to judiciously\r\nexercise such power.\r\n\r\nIn concluding this communication its last words shall be an appeal to\r\nthe Congress for the most rigid economy in the expenditure of the money\r\nit holds in trust for the people. The way to perplexing extravagance is\r\neasy, but a return to frugality is difficult. When, however, it is\r\nconsidered that those who bear the burdens of taxation have no guaranty\r\nof honest care save in the fidelity of their public servants, the duty\r\nof all possible retrenchment is plainly manifest.\r\n\r\nWhen our differences are forgotten and our contests of political\r\nopinion are no longer remembered, nothing in the retrospect of our\r\npublic service will be as fortunate and comforting as the recollection\r\nof official duty well performed and the memory of a constant devotion\r\nto the interests of our confiding fellow-countrymen.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's State of the Union Addresses, by Grover Cleveland",
