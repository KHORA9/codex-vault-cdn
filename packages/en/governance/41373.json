He thought\r\nthis idea a good one, and agreed to write such a note. But Mr. Blunt was\r\nborn in 1840, and has for a number of years been in failing health. In\r\nJune he wrote me that he was so ill as to be quite unable to finish the\r\nforeword, which he had actually commenced to write. He felt furthermore\r\nthat any advantage the edition would gain by having a new preface by him\r\nwould be more than counterbalanced by any delay in the appearance of the\r\nbook \"at the present extremely critical moment.\"\r\n\r\nHe remarked further: \"What could I have said more appropriate today as a\r\nnew preface than the few words which already stand as the short preface\r\nI set to the first edition of my _Secret History_ (published in London\r\nand which you reprint in this new edition). This and my poem _The Wind\r\nand the Whirlwind_ (which you also give as an Appendix). Both are\r\nabsolutely true of the present shameful position of England in Egypt and\r\nthe calamity so closely threatening her Eastern Empire. What could I say\r\nmore exactly suited? This is the punishment we are reaping today for our\r\nsin of that sad morning on the Nile which saw the first English gun open\r\nits thunder of aggression just forty years ago at Alexandria in the name\r\nof England's honour. What could I add to my words of grief and shame\r\nthen uttered and repeated here? Let these stand for my new preface. My\r\nday is done. Alas! that I should have lived to see those words come true\r\nof England's punishment, more than true.\"\r\n\r\nA. A. K.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE OF 1895\r\n\r\n\r\nI desire to place on record in a succinct and tangible form the events\r\nwhich have come within my knowledge relating to the origin of the\r\nEnglish occupation of Egypt--not necessarily for publication now, but as\r\nan available document for the history of our times. At one moment I\r\nplayed in these events a somewhat prominent part, and for nearly twenty\r\nyears I have been a close and interested spectator of the drama which\r\nwas being acted at Cairo.\r\n\r\nIt may well be, also, that the Egyptian question, though now quiescent,\r\nwill reassert itself unexpectedly in some urgent form hereafter,\r\nrequiring of Englishmen a new examination of their position there,\r\npolitical and moral; and I wish to have at hand and ready for their\r\nenlightenment the whole of the materials I possess. I will give these as\r\nclearly as I can, with such documents in the shape of letters and\r\njournals as I can bring together in corroboration of my evidence,\r\ndisguising nothing and telling the whole truth as I know it. It is not\r\nalways in official documents that the truest facts of history are to be\r\nread, and certainly in the case of Egypt, where intrigue of all kinds\r\nhas been so rife, the sincere student needs help to understand the\r\npublished parliamentary papers.\r\n\r\nLastly, for the Egyptians, if ever they succeed in re-establishing\r\nthemselves as an autonomous nation, it will be of value that they should\r\nhave recorded the evidence of one whom they know to be their sincere\r\nfriend in regard to matters of diplomatic obscurity which to this day\r\nthey fail to realize. My relations with Downing Street in 1882 need to\r\nbe related in detail if Egyptians are ever to appreciate the exact\r\ncauses which led to the bombardment of Alexandria and the battle of\r\nTel-el-Kebir, while justice to the patriot leader of their \"rebellion\"\r\nrequires that I should give a no less detailed account of Arabi's trial,\r\nwhich still presents itself to some Egyptian as to all French minds, in\r\nthe light of a pre-arranged comedy devised to screen a traitor. It does\r\nnot do to leave truth to its own power of prevailing over lies, and\r\nhistory is full of calumnies which have remained unrefuted, and of\r\ningratitudes which nations have persisted in towards their worthiest\r\nsons.\r\n\r\nSHEYKH OBEYD, EGYPT.\r\n\r\n1895\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE ON PUBLICATION\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the first brief preface to my manuscript was written twelve years\r\nago, events have happened which seem to indicate that the moment\r\nforeseen in it has at last arrived when to the public advantage and\r\nwithout risk of serious indiscretion as far as individuals are\r\nconcerned, the whole truth may be given to the world.\r\n\r\nAlready in 1904 the original manuscript had been thoroughly revised, and\r\nin its purely Egyptian part remodelled under circumstances which add\r\ngreatly to its historic value. My old Egyptian friend, Sheykh Mohammed\r\nAbdu, of whom so much mention is made in it, had taken up his country\r\nresidence at my doors at Sheykh Obeyd, and I found myself in almost\r\ndaily intercourse with him, a most precious accident of which I did not\r\nfail to take full advantage. That great philosopher and patriot--now,\r\nalas, lost to us, for he died at Alexandria, 11th July, 1905, the day\r\nbeing the twenty-third anniversary of the bombardment of that\r\ncity--after many vicissitudes of evil and good fortune had attained in\r\nthe year 1899 to the supreme position in Egypt of Grand Mufti, and\r\nhaving thus acquired a wider sphere than ever of influence with his\r\nfellow countrymen, had it at heart to bequeath to them a true account of\r\nthe events of his time, events which had become strangely misunderstood\r\nby them, and clothed with legends altogether fantastic and unreal.\r\n\r\nOn this subject he often spoke to me, regretting his lack of leisure to\r\ncomplete the historic work, and when I told him of my own memoir, he\r\nurged me very strongly to publish it, if not in English at least with\r\nhis help in Arabic, and he undertook to go through it with me and see\r\nthat all that part of it which related to matters within his knowledge\r\nwas accurately and fully told. We had been personal friends and\r\npolitical allies almost from the date of my first visit to Egypt, and\r\nwith his garden adjoining mine it was an easy matter for us to work\r\ntogether and compare our recollections of the men and things we had\r\nknown. It was in this way that my history of an epoch so memorable to us\r\nboth took final shape, and I was able (how fortunately!) to complete it\r\nand obtain from him his approval and _imprimatur_ before his\r\nunlooked-for death closed forever the chief source of knowledge which he\r\nundoubtedly was of the political movement which led up to the revolution\r\nof 1881, and of the intrigues which marred it in the following year.\r\n\r\nThe Mufti's death, a severe blow to me as well as to Egypt, postponed\r\nindefinitely our plan of publishing in Arabic, nor till the present year\r\nhas the time seemed politically ripe for the production of my work in\r\nEnglish. The events, however, of 1906, and now Lord Cromer's retirement\r\nfrom the Egyptian scene, have so wholly changed the situation that I\r\nfeel I ought no longer to delay, at least as far as my duty to my own\r\ncountrymen is concerned. We English are confronted to-day in our\r\ndealings with Egypt with very much the same problem we misunderstood and\r\nblundered about so disastrously a generation ago, and if those of us who\r\nare responsible for public decisions are, in the words of my first\r\npreface, to \"re-examine their position there, political and moral,\"\r\nhonestly or to any profit, it is necessary they should first have set\r\nbefore them the past as it really was and not as it has been presented\r\nto them so long by the fallacious documents of their official Blue\r\nBooks. I should probably not be wrong in asserting that neither Lord\r\nCromer at Cairo nor Sir Edward Grey at home, nor yet Lord Cromer's\r\nsuccessor Sir Eldon Gorst, have any accurate knowledge of what occurred\r\nin Egypt twenty-five years ago--this notwithstanding Lord Cromer's tardy\r\nrecognition of the reform movement of 1881 and his eulogium of Sheykh\r\nMohammed Abdu repeated so recently as in his last annual Report. Lord\r\nCromer, it must be remembered, was not at Cairo during any part of the\r\nrevolutionary period here described, and, until quite recently, has\r\nalways assumed the \"official truth\" regarding it to be the only truth.\r\n\r\nFor this reason I have decided now finally on publication, giving the\r\ntext of my Memoir as it was completed in January, 1905, the identical\r\ntext of which my friend signified his approval suppressing only certain\r\nbrief passages which seem to me still too personal in regard to\r\nindividuals living, and which could be excised without injury to the\r\nvolume's complete historic value. I can sincerely say that in all I\r\nhave written my one great aim has been to disclose the _vérité vraie_ as\r\nit is known to me for misguided History's sake.\r\n\r\nIf there is at all a second reason with me, it must be looked for in a\r\npromise publicly made as long ago as in the September number of the\r\n\"Nineteenth Century Review\" of 1882 that I would complete some day my\r\npersonal _Apologia_ in regard to events then contemporary. At that time\r\nand out of consideration for Mr. Gladstone, and for the hope I had that\r\nhe would yet repair the wrong he had done to liberty in Egypt, I\r\nforbore, in the face of much obloquy, to exculpate myself by a full\r\nrevelation of the hidden circumstances which were my justification. I\r\ncould not clear myself entirely without telling facts technically\r\nconfidential, and I decided to be silent.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a limit to the duty of reticence owed to public men\r\nin public affairs, and I am confident that my abstention of a quarter of\r\na century will excuse me with fair judging minds if I now at last make\r\nmy conduct quite clear in the only way possible to me, namely, by a\r\ncomplete exposure in detail of the whole drama of financial intrigue and\r\npolitical weakness as it was at the time revealed to me, substantiating\r\nit by the contemporary documents still in my possession. If the\r\nsusceptibilities of some persons in high places are touched by a too\r\ncandid recital, I can but reply that the necessity of speech has been\r\nput on me by their own long lack of candour and generosity. During all\r\nthese years not one of those who knew the truth has said a confessing\r\nword on my behalf. It will be enough if I repeat with Raleigh:\r\n\r\n    Go, Soul, the Body's guest,\r\n      Upon a thankless errand.\r\n    Fear not to touch the best,\r\n      The truth shall be thy warrant.\r\n    Then go, for thou must die,\r\n    And give the world the lie.\r\n\r\nWILFRID SCAWEN BLUNT.\r\n\r\nNEWBUILDINGS PLACE, SUSSEX.\r\n\r\n_April_, 1907.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n PREFACE OF 1895                                 vii\r\n\r\n PREFACE ON PUBLICATION, 1907                     ix\r\n\r\n     I.

Before, however,\r\ndescribing my impressions of this my earliest acquaintance made with the\r\nEgyptian people, it may be as well, that, for their benefit and the\r\nbenefit of foreign readers generally, I should say a few words in\r\nexplanation of what my previous life had been as far as it had had any\r\nrelation to public affairs. It will show them my exact position in my\r\nown country, and help them to understand how it came about that,\r\nbeginning as a mere onlooker at what was passing in their country, I\r\ngradually became interested in it politically and ended by taking an\r\nactive part in the revolution which six years later developed itself\r\namong them. I was already thirty-five years of age at the date of this\r\nfirst visit, and had seen much of men and things.\r\n\r\nI began life rather early. Belonging to a family of the landed gentry of\r\nthe south of England with strong Conservative traditions and connected\r\nwith some of the then leaders of the Tory party, I was placed at the age\r\nof eighteen in the Diplomatic Service, in the first instance as attaché\r\nto the British Legation at Athens where King Otho was still on the\r\nthrone of Greece, and afterwards, during a space of twelve years, as\r\nmember of other legations and embassies to the various Courts of Europe,\r\nin all of which I learned a little of my profession, amused myself, and\r\nmade friends. I was thus, between 1859 and 1869, for some weeks at\r\nConstantinople in the reign of Sultan Abd-el-Mejid; for a couple of\r\nyears in the Germany of the Germanic Confederation; for a year in Spain\r\nunder Queen Isabella; and for another year in Paris at the climax of the\r\nEmperor's prestige under Napoleon III; and I was also for a short time\r\nin the Republic of Switzerland, in South America, and in Portugal.\r\nEverywhere my diplomatic recollections are agreeable ones, but they are\r\nwithout special political interest or importance of any official kind.\r\n\r\nOur English diplomacy in those days, the years following the Crimean\r\nWar, which had disgusted Englishmen with foreign adventures, was very\r\ndifferent from what it has since become. It was essentially pacific,\r\nunaggressive, and devoid of those subtleties which have since earned it\r\na reputation of astuteness at the cost of its honesty. Official zeal was\r\nat a discount in the public service, and nothing was more certain to\r\nbring a young diplomatist into discredit at the Foreign Office than an\r\nattempt, however laudable, to raise any new question in a form demanding\r\na public answer. We attachés and junior secretaries were very clearly\r\ngiven to understand this, and that it was not our business to meddle\r\nwith the politics of the Courts to which we were accredited, only to\r\nmake ourselves agreeable socially, and amuse ourselves, decorously if\r\npossible, but at any rate in the reverse of any serious sense. It is no\r\nexaggeration when I affirm it that in the whole twelve years of my\r\ndiplomatic life I was asked to discharge no duty of the smallest\r\nprofessional importance. This discouraging _régime_ gave me, while I was\r\nin the service, a thorough distaste for politics, nor was it till long\r\nafter, and under very different conditions and under circumstances\r\nwholly accidental, that I at last turned my attention seriously to them.\r\nMy pursuits as an attaché were those of pleasure, social intercourse,\r\nand literature. I wrote poems, not despatches, and though I assisted\r\ndiplomatically at some of the serious dramas of the day in Europe, it\r\nwas in the spirit of a spectator rather than of an actor, and of one\r\nhardly admitted at all behind the scenes. On my marriage in 1869, which\r\nwas soon followed by the death of my elder brother which left me heir to\r\nthe family estates in Sussex, I retired without regret from the public\r\nservice to attend to matters of private concern which had always\r\ninterested me more.\r\n\r\nNevertheless my early connection with the Foreign Office, though it was\r\nnever to be officially renewed, was maintained on a friendly footing as\r\nof one honourably retired from the service, and this and my experience\r\nof Courts and capitals abroad, proved later of no little value to me\r\nwhen I once more found myself thrown by accident into the stream of\r\ninternational affairs. It gave me the advantage of a professional\r\nknowledge of the machinery of foreign politics and, what was still more\r\nimportant, a personal acquaintance with many of those who were working\r\nthat machinery. Not a few of these had been my intimate friends. Thus at\r\nthe very outset of my life I had found myself in official fellowship\r\nwith Lord Currie, who for so many years directed the permanent policy of\r\nthe Foreign Office, with Sir Henry Drummond Wolff, Sir Frank Lascelles,\r\nSir Edward Malet, Lord Dufferin, Lord Vivian, and Sir Rivers Wilson, all\r\nclosely connected afterwards with the making of Egyptian history, with\r\nLord Lytton who was to be Viceroy of India in the years immediately\r\npreceding the crisis of 1881, and amongst foreign diplomatists with M.\r\nde Nélidoff, Russian Ambassador at Constantinople, Baron Haymerly, who\r\ndied Prime Minister of the Austrian Empire, and M. de Staal, for twenty\r\nyears Russian Ambassador in London. With all these I was on terms of\r\npersonal intimacy long before I paid my first visit to Egypt, and it is\r\nwith a full knowledge of their individual characters that I am able to\r\nspeak of them and judge them. Having been myself, as it were, of the\r\npriesthood, I could not well be deceived by the common insincerities\r\nwhich are the stock in trade of diplomacy, or mistake for public policy\r\naction which was often only personal. It is far too readily believed by\r\nthose who are without individual experience of diplomacy that the great\r\nevents of the world's history are the result of elaborate political\r\ndesign and not as they are really in most instances, dependent upon\r\nunforeseen accidents and the personal strength or weakness, sometimes\r\nthe personal whim, of the agents employed.\r\n\r\nFor the first few years of my retirement from the service I occupied\r\nmyself entirely with my domestic affairs, and, as I have said, it was\r\nonly by accident that my mind was gradually turned to politics. In 1873,\r\nfinding myself in indifferent health, and to escape a late spring in\r\nEngland, I made with my wife our first common journey in Eastern lands.\r\nWe went by Belgrade and the Danube to Constantinople, where we found Sir\r\nHenry Elliott at the Embassy and renewed acquaintance with other friends\r\nconnected with it, among them with Dr. Dickson, of whom I shall have\r\nafterwards to speak in connection with the tragical death of Sultan\r\nAbd-el-Aziz, and who attended me with great kindness during a sharp\r\nattack of pneumonia I had there and for whom I contracted a sincere\r\nregard. The Ottoman Empire was then enjoying a period of comparative\r\ntranquillity before the storm of war which was so soon to burst over it,\r\nand I troubled myself little with its internal broils, but my\r\nsympathies, such as they were at that time, were, in common with those\r\nof most Englishmen of the day, with the Turks rather than the Christians\r\nof the Empire. On my recovery from my illness, I bought half a dozen\r\npack horses at the At-maidan, the horse market at Stamboul, and with\r\nthem we crossed over to Scutari and spent six pleasant summer weeks\r\nwandering in the hills and through the poppy fields of Asia Minor, away\r\nfrom beaten tracks and seeing as much of the Turkish peasant life as our\r\nentire ignorance of their language allowed. We were impressed, as all\r\ntravellers have been, with the honest goodness of these people and the\r\nbadness of their Government. We judged of the latter by what we saw of\r\nthe ways of the Zaptiehs, our semi-military escort, whose manner with\r\nthem was that of soldiers in an invaded country. Yet it was clear that\r\nwith much fiscal oppression a large personal liberty existed in rural\r\nTurkey for the poor, such as contrasted not unfavourably with our own\r\npolice and magistrate-ridden England. The truth is that everywhere in\r\nthe East the administrative net is one of wide meshes, with rents\r\ninnumerable through which all but the largest fish have good chance of\r\nescaping. In ordinary times there is no persecution of the quite\r\nindigent. I remember telling some peasants, who had complained to me\r\nthrough my Armenian dragoman of hardship in their lives at Government\r\nhands, that there were countries in still worse plight than their own,\r\nwhere if a poor man so much as lay down by the roadside at night and got\r\ntogether a few sticks to cook a meal he ran the risk of being brought\r\nnext day before the Cadi and cast into prison; and I remember that my\r\nlisteners refused to believe my tale or that such great tyranny existed\r\nanywhere in the world. My deduction from this incident is the earliest\r\npolitical reflection I can remember making in regard to Eastern things.\r\n\r\nThe following winter--that is to say, the early months of 1874--we spent\r\nin Algeria. Here we assisted at another spectacle which gave food for\r\nreflection: that of an Eastern people in violent subjection to a\r\nWestern. The war in which France had just been engaged with Germany had\r\nbeen followed in Algeria by an Arab rising, which had spread to the very\r\noutskirts of Algiers, and the Mohammedan natives were now experiencing\r\nthe extreme rigours of Christian repression. This was worst in the\r\nsettled districts, the colony proper, where the civil administration was\r\ntaking advantage of the rebellion to confiscate native property and in\r\nevery way to favour the European colonists at the native expense. With\r\nall my love for the French (and I had been at Paris during the war, and\r\nhad been enthusiastic for its defence at the time of the siege) I found\r\nmy sympathies in Algeria going out wholly to the Arabs. In the Sahara,\r\nbeyond the Atlas, where military rule prevailed, things were somewhat\r\nbetter, for the French officers for the most part appreciated the\r\nnobler qualities of the Arabs and despised the mixed rascaldom\r\nof Europe--Spanish, Italian, and Maltese as well as their own\r\ncountrymen--which made up the \"Colonie.\" The great tribes of the Sahara\r\nwere still at that time materially well off, and retained not a little\r\nof their ancient pride of independence which the military commandants\r\ncould not but respect. We caught glimpses of these nomads in the Jebel\r\nAmour and of their vigorous way of life, and what we saw delighted us.\r\nWe listened to their chauntings in praise of their lost hero\r\nAbd-el-Kader, and though we misunderstood them on many points owing to\r\nour ignorance of their language, we admired and pitied them. The\r\ncontrast between their noble pastoral life on the one hand, with their\r\ncamel herds and horses, a life of high tradition filled with the memory\r\nof heroic deeds, and on the other hand the ignoble squalor of the Frank\r\nsettlers, with their wineshops and their swine, was one which could not\r\nescape us, or fail to rouse in us an angry sense of the incongruity\r\nwhich has made of these last the lords of the land and of those their\r\nservants. It was a new political lesson which I took to heart, though\r\nstill regarding it as in no sense my personal affair.\r\n\r\nSuch had been the preliminary training of my life, and such its main\r\ncircumstances when, as I have said, in the winter of 1875-6 I first\r\nvisited Egypt. The only other matter which, perhaps, deserves here a\r\nword of explanation to non-English readers, and it is one that in Europe\r\nwill receive its full appreciation, is the fact that my wife, Lady Anne\r\nBlunt, who accompanied me on all these travels, was the grandaughter of\r\nour great national poet, Lord Byron, and so was the inheritor, in some\r\nsort, of sympathies in the cause of freedom in the East, which were not\r\nwithout their effect upon our subsequent action. It seemed to us, in\r\npresence of the events of 1881-2, that to champion the cause of Arabian\r\nliberty would be as worthy an endeavour as had been that for which Byron\r\nhad died in 1827. As yet, however, in 1875, neither of us had any\r\nthought in visiting Egypt more serious than that of another pleasant\r\ntravelling adventure in Eastern lands. We had on leaving England the\r\nplan of entering Egypt from the south, by way of Suakim, Kassala, and\r\nthe Blue Nile, and so of working our way northwards to Cairo in the\r\nspring, but this, owing to the issue, just then so unfortunate to Egypt,\r\nof the Abyssinian campaign, was never realized, and the only part of our\r\nprogram which we carried out was that instead of landing at Alexandria,\r\nas was then the universal custom, we went on by the Canal to Suez and\r\nthere first set foot upon Egyptian soil.\r\n\r\nMy first impression of all of Egypt is of our passage on the last day of\r\nthe year 1875 through Lake Menzaleh, at that time the unpersecuted home\r\nof innumerable birds--a truly wonderful spectacle of prodigal natural\r\nlife--to a point on the Canal north of Ismaïlia. What a sight it was!\r\nLake Menzaleh was still an almost virgin region, and the flocks of\r\nflamingos, ducks, pelicans, and ibises which covered it, passed all\r\nbelief in their prodigious magnitude. The waters, too, of the lakes and\r\nof the Canal itself were alive with fish so large and in such great\r\nquantities that not a few were run down by our ship's bows in passing,\r\nwhile everywhere they were being preyed on by fish hawks and cormorants,\r\nwhich sat watching on the posts and buoys. I imagine that the letting in\r\nof the sea for the first time on land never before covered with water\r\nprovided the fish with feeding ground of exceptional richness, an\r\nadvantage which has since been lost. But certain it is that both fish\r\nand birds have dwindled sadly since, and it seems unlikely that the\r\nsplendid spectacle we saw that winter will be again enjoyed there by any\r\ntraveller's eyes.\r\n\r\nWe landed at Suez in the first days of the year 1876, and the news of\r\nthe great disaster which had overtaken the Egyptian army in Abyssinia\r\nwas the first that greeted us. The details of it were not generally\r\nknown, but it appeared that seven ortas, or divisions, of the Khedivial\r\ntroops had perished, while a tale was in circulation of the Khedive's\r\nson, Prince Hassan, having been captured and mutilated by the enemy, an\r\nexaggeration which was afterwards disproved, for the prince, a mere boy\r\nat the time, had been carried away from the battlefield of Kora early in\r\nthe day, at the very beginning of the rout, as had Ratib Pasha himself,\r\nthe Egyptian general in command, who was in charge of him. Loringe\r\nPasha, however, the American, had really lost his life with many\r\nthousands of the rank and file, and the misfortune put a final limit to\r\nthe Khedive Ismaïl's ambition of universal empire on the Nile. In our\r\nsmall way it affected us, as making our thought of a journey to Kassala\r\nimpossible, and deciding us on a less adventurous one immediately in\r\nLower Egypt.\r\n\r\nWe were anxious, nevertheless, to see Egypt in a less conventional way\r\nthan that of ordinary tourists, and, having our camping equipment with\r\nus for the longer journey, we hired camels at Suez and went by the old\r\ncaravan route to Cairo. It is not necessary that I should say much of\r\nour journey across the desert. The four days spent in it alone with our\r\nBedouin camel-men gave us our first practical lessons in Arabic--in\r\nAlgeria we had been dependent wholly on a dragoman--and they laid the\r\nbasis, too, of those relations with the desert tribes of Arabia which\r\nwere afterwards to become so pleasant to us and so intimate. On the\r\nfifth morning we entered Cairo, greeted on our arrival at Abbassiyeh by\r\nthe whistling of bullets fired by the Khedivial troops at practice, for\r\nwe had unwittingly encamped overnight just behind their targets and the\r\naim of the recruits was very uncertain, but no harm was suffered. We\r\nlittle thought at the time that we should ever be interested in the\r\ndoings of these soldiers as a fighting army, and still less that our\r\nsympathies would one day be with them in a war against our own\r\ncountrymen. I was as yet, though not perhaps even then enthusiastically\r\nso, a believer in the common English creed that England had a\r\nprovidential mission in the East, and that our wars were only waged\r\nthere for honest and beneficent reasons. Nothing was further from my\r\nmind than that we English ever could be guilty, as a nation, of a great\r\nbetrayal of justice in arms for our mere selfish interests.\r\n\r\nNeither need I say anything in detail about Cairo, through which we\r\npassed that day without stopping longer than to ask for our letters at\r\nthe Consulate. Our object was to see the country districts and not to\r\nwaste time on a city already in part European, and we thought to find\r\ncamping ground immediately beyond the Nile. So we rode on. We did not\r\nunderstand the entreaties of our camel-men that we should alight and let\r\nthem and their camels go back, or realize that we were doing them an\r\ninjustice by forcing them to break the tribal rule which forbade them as\r\nBedouins of the eastern desert to cross over to the west. In spite of\r\ntheir expostulations we held on our way by the Kasr-el-Nil bridge and\r\nthe road to Ghizeh. We had caught sight of the Pyramids and pushed on\r\neagerly in their direction, and were only stopped by the failing light\r\nwhich overtook us at sunset close to the little fellah village of\r\nTolbiya, the last but one before the Pyramids are reached. It was there\r\nthat we made our halt and alighted for the first time on the black soil\r\nof the Nile, as yet hardly dry from the autumn inundation.\r\n\r\nThe good people of Tolbiya, in their hearty fellah fashion, received us\r\nwith all possible hospitality. Though living on the tourist road to the\r\nPyramids and accustomed to treat Frank travellers in some sort as their\r\nprey, the fact of our alighting at their village for a night's lodging\r\ngave us a character of guests they at once recognized. Of all the\r\nEuropeans who for many years had passed their way, not one had made a\r\npause at their doors. Thus our relations with them were from the outset\r\nfriendly, and the accident served us as an introduction in the sequel to\r\nother villagers when, after a few days spent among these, we went once\r\nmore on our way. We had no choice at the time but to stay where we were,\r\nfor in the morning our Bedouins refused to go a mile farther with us,\r\nand, having received their hire, departed with their camels. Other\r\ncamels then had to be found. So it happened that my first week in Egypt\r\nwas occupied in going a round of the neighbouring village markets in\r\nsearch of the needed beasts, and making purchases of pack saddles and\r\nwater, skins and all kinds of travelling gear for our further journey.\r\n\r\nThe fellahin at that time were in terrible straits of poverty. It was\r\nthe first of the three last terrible years of the Khedive Ismaïl's\r\nreign; Ismaïl Sadyk, the notorious Mufettish, was in power; the European\r\nbondholders were clamouring for their \"coupons,\" and famine was at the\r\ndoors of the fellahin. It was rare in those days to see a man in the\r\nfields with a turban on his head, or with more than a shirt to his back.\r\nEven in the neighbourhood of Cairo, and still more in the Fayûm to which\r\nwe took our way as soon as the camels were procured, I can testify that\r\nthis was the case. The country Sheykhs themselves had few of them a\r\ncloak to wear. Wherever we went it was the same. The provincial towns on\r\nmarket days were full of women selling their clothes and their silver\r\nornaments to the Greek usurers, because the tax collectors were in their\r\nvillages whip in hand. We bought their poor trinkets and listened to\r\ntheir stories, and joined them in their maledictions on a government\r\nwhich was laying them bare. We did not as yet understand, any more than\r\ndid the peasants themselves, the financial pressure from Europe which\r\nwas the true cause of these extreme exactions; and we laid the blame, as\r\nthey did, on Ismaïl Pasha and the Mufettish, Ismaïl Sadyk, little\r\nsuspecting our English share of the blame.\r\n\r\nThe villagers were outspoken enough. Englishmen in those days were\r\npopular everywhere in Mohammedan lands, being looked upon as free from\r\nthe political designs of the other Frank nations, and individually as\r\nhonester than these in their commercial dealings. In Egypt especially\r\nthey stood in amiable contrast with the needy adventures from\r\nthe Mediterranean sea-board--the Italian, Greek, and Maltese\r\nmoney-lenders--who were sucking the life blood of the Moslem peasantry.\r\nAlready there were rumours in the air which had reached the village of a\r\npossible European intervention, and the idea of it, if it was to be\r\nEnglish, was not unpopular. The truth is that the existing state of\r\nthings was wholly unendurable, and any change was looked to with joy by\r\nthe starving people as a possible relief. England to the fellahin in\r\ntheir actual condition of beggary, robbed and beaten and perishing of\r\nhunger, appeared in the light of a bountiful and friendly providence\r\nvery rich and quite disinterested, a redresser of wrongs and friend of\r\nthe oppressed, just such, in fact, as individual English tourists then\r\noften were, who went about with open hands and expressions of sympathy.\r\nThey did not suspect the immense commercial selfishness which had led\r\nus, collectively as a nation, to so many aggressions on the weak races\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1876 I too, as I have said, was a believer in England, and I\r\nshared the common idea of the beneficence of her rule in the East, and I\r\nhad no other thought for the Egyptians than that they should share with\r\nIndia, which I had not yet seen, the privilege of our protection. \"The\r\nEgyptians,\" I wrote in my journal of the time, \"are a good, honest\r\npeople as any in the world--all, that is, who do not sit in the high\r\nplaces. Of these I know nothing. But the peasants, the fellahin, have\r\nevery virtue which should make a happy, well-to-do-society. They are\r\ncheerful, industrious, obedient to law, and pre-eminently sober, not\r\nonly in the matter of drink, but of the other indulgences to which human\r\nnature is prone. They are neither gamblers nor brawlers, nor licentious\r\nlivers; they love their homes, their wives, their children. They are\r\ngood sons and fathers, kind to dumb animals, old men, beggars, and\r\nidiots. They are absolutely without prejudice of race, and perhaps even\r\nof religion. Their chief fault is a love of money, but that is one\r\npolitical economists will readily pardon.... It would be difficult to\r\nfind anywhere a population better fitted to attain the economical end of\r\nthe greatest happiness for the greatest number. In politics they have no\r\naspirations except to live and let live, to be allowed to work and keep\r\nthe produce of their labour, to buy and sell without interference and to\r\nescape taxation. They have been ill-treated for ages without losing\r\nthereby their goodness of heart; they have few of the picturesque\r\nvirtues; they are neither patriotic nor fanatical nor romantically\r\ngenerous. But they are free from the picturesque vices. Each man works\r\nfor himself--at most for his family. The idea of self-sacrifice for the\r\npublic good they do not understand, but they are innocent of plots to\r\nenslave their fellows.... In spite of the monstrous oppression of which\r\nthey are the victims, we have heard no word of revolt, this not from any\r\nsuperstitious regard for their rulers, for they are without political\r\nprejudice, but because revolt is no more in their nature than it is in a\r\nflock of sheep. They would hail the Queen of England, or the Pope, or\r\nthe King of Ashantee with equal eagerness if these came with the gift\r\nfor them of a penny less taxation in the pound.\"\r\n\r\nSuch were my first thoughts about Egypt in the early days of 1876, not\r\naltogether inaccurate ones, though I was far from suspecting the growth\r\nalready beginning of political ideas in the towns. Neither did I\r\nunderstand the full influence of European finance in the hardships from\r\nwhich the peasantry were suffering. Nevertheless, on our return to Cairo\r\nin March I saw something of the reverse of the medal. Mr. Cave's\r\nfinancial mission had arrived during our tour, and was established in\r\none of the palaces on the Shubra Road, and from its members--one of whom\r\nwas an old acquaintance, Victor Buckley of the Foreign Office, and from\r\nColonel Staunton, our Consul-General--I learned something of the\r\ncondition of financial affairs; while a little later Sir Rivers Wilson,\r\nalso my friend, who was to play later so prominent a part in Egyptian\r\naffairs, appeared at Cairo and joined the other members of the financial\r\ninquiry. What their report was of the condition of affairs I need not\r\nhere relate in detail, but it will help to an understanding of the\r\nmatter if I give a very short account of it and how their mission came\r\nto be appointed, the first of its kind in Egypt.[1]\r\n\r\nThe Khedive Ismaïl's reign had begun in the full tide of a period for\r\nEgypt of high material prosperity. His predecessor, Saïd, a man of\r\nfairly enlightened views, had had the good sense to give all possible\r\nencouragement to the fellahin in agricultural matters. He had abandoned\r\nthe claim of the Viceroy to be sole landlord on the Nile, had recognized\r\nproprietary rights in the existing occupiers of land, and had fixed the\r\nland tax at the low figure of forty piastres to the feddan. This had\r\nresulted in a general enrichment of the population, and the fellahin,\r\nemancipated from their old condition of serfdom to the Circassian\r\nPashas, were everywhere accumulating wealth. Egypt at the close of\r\nSaïd's reign had become not only the most prosperous province of the\r\nOttoman Empire, but one of the most progressive agriculturally of the\r\nEastern world. The revenue, though small in comparison to what it is\r\nnow, probably not more than four millions sterling, was easily\r\ncollected, and the expenses of administration were insignificant, while\r\nthe public debt amounted to only three millions. It is true that in his\r\nlater years Saïd had granted a number of concessions to European\r\nadventurers on terms which were becoming a heavy burden on the state,\r\nbut the general wealth of the country was so large that this was not\r\nmore than its light taxation could bear, and the Viceroy had at his\r\ndisposal, when all yearly claims had been discharged, probably not less\r\nthan a couple of millions for his free expenditure. Certainly there\r\nnever had been an age in Egypt when the mass of the native inhabitants\r\nhad been so materially prosperous; and to the fellahin especially it had\r\ncome to be spoken of as, for them, the \"age of gold.\" Ismaïl, when in\r\n1860 he succeeded to the Viceroyalty, was without question the richest\r\nof Mohammedan princes and master of the most prosperous of Mohammedan\r\nstates.\r\n\r\nIsmaïl's character, before he became Viceroy, had been that of a wealthy\r\nlanded proprietor managing his large estates in Upper Egypt according to\r\nthe most enlightened modern methods. He was praised by nearly all\r\nEuropean travellers for the machinery he had introduced and the\r\nexpenditure he had turned to profit, and it is certain that he possessed\r\na more than usual share of that natural shrewdness and commercial\r\naptitude which distinguishes the family of Mohammed Ali. His succession\r\nto the Viceroyalty had been more or less a surprise to him, for until\r\nwithin a few months of Saïd's death he had not been the immediate heir,\r\nand his prospects had been only those of an opulent private person. It\r\nwas perhaps this unexpected stroke of fortune that from the beginning of\r\nhis reign led him to extravagance. By nature a speculator and\r\ninordinately greedy of wealth, he seems to have looked upon his\r\ninheritance and the absolute power now suddenly placed in his hands, not\r\nas a public trust, but as the means above all things else of\r\naggrandizing his private fortune. At the same time he was as\r\ninordinately vain and fond of pleasure, and his head was turned by his\r\nhigh position and the opportunity it gave him of figuring in the world\r\nas one of its most splendid princes. He was surrounded at once by\r\nflatterers of all kinds, native and European, who promised on the one\r\nhand to make him the richest of financiers, and on the other the\r\ngreatest of Oriental sovereigns. In listening to these his own\r\ncleverness and commercial skill betrayed him, and made him only their\r\nmore ready dupe. Ismaïl, before his accession, had been an astute\r\nmoney-maker according to the ways in which money was then made in Egypt,\r\nand he had had, too, a European education of the kind Orientals acquire\r\non the Paris boulevards, superficial as regards all serious matters, but\r\nsufficient to convince him of his capacity to deal with the rogues of\r\nthe Bourse with the weapons of their own roguery. In both directions he\r\nwas led astray.\r\n\r\nHis first act of self aggrandizement was simple and successful. The\r\nrevenue, which rested chiefly on the land tax, was low, and he raised it\r\nby progressive enhancements from the 40 piastres where he found it, to\r\n160, where it has ever since stood. The country under his hand was rich\r\nand at first could afford the extra burden. Men gave of their\r\nsuperfluity rather than of their necessity, and for some years did so\r\nwithout complaint. This enhancement, however, of the revenue was only\r\npart of his rapacious program. His native flatterers reminded him that\r\nin the days of his grandfather the whole land had been regarded as the\r\nViceroy's personal property, and that, moreover, Mohammed Ali had\r\nclaimed and exercised for some years a monopoly of its foreign trade.\r\nIsmaïl schemed to revive these rights in his own person, and though he\r\ndid not dare, in the face of European opinion, to commit any great acts\r\nof open confiscation in regard to the land, he gained to a large extent\r\nhis ends by other means, and so rapidly that in a few years he managed\r\nto get into his own hands a fifth of the whole area of the cultivable\r\nland of Egypt. His method was by various means of intimidation and\r\nadministrative pressure to make the possession of such lands as he\r\ndesired to acquire a burden to their owners, and to render their lives\r\nso vexatious that they should be constrained to sell at prices little\r\nmore than nominal. In this way he had, as I have said, possessed himself\r\nof an enormous property in land, and he doubtless thought that this was\r\nto prove to him a correspondingly enormous source of personal income.\r\nBut his very covetousness in the matter proved his ruin. It was found in\r\npractice that while under his personal management as a comparatively\r\nsmall owner his estates had been well worked, and had brought him\r\nwealth, his new gigantic ownership laid him open to losses in a hundred\r\nways. In vain he laid out enormous sums on machinery. In vain he laid\r\nwhole villages and districts under contribution to furnish him forced\r\nlabour. In vain he started factories on his estates and employed\r\nmanagers from Europe at the highest salaries. He was robbed everywhere\r\nby his agents, and was unable to gather from his lands even a fraction\r\nof the revenue they had brought in taxation when not his own. This was\r\nthe beginning of his financial difficulties, coinciding as it did with\r\nthe sudden fall in agricultural prices, and especially of cotton, which\r\nsoon after set in, and it was the beginning, too, of the ruin of the\r\npeasantry, whom, to supply his deficiency, he now loaded with irregular\r\ntaxation of all kinds. Ismaïl Sadyk, the notorious Mufettish, was his\r\nchief agent in this disastrous history.\r\n\r\nIt was not long, however, before Ismaïl fell into much more dangerous\r\nhands, and embarked in much more ruinous adventures than these early\r\nones. To say nothing of the enormous sums which he poured out like water\r\non his own private pleasures, of his follies of palace building, his\r\nfollies with European women, and his follies of royal entertainment,\r\nthere were schemes of ambition vast enough to drain the purse of any\r\ntreasury. It is not known precisely how many millions he expended at\r\nConstantinople in procuring himself the Khedivial title, and in getting\r\nthe order of the viceregal succession altered in favour of his son. But\r\nit must have been very many, while still more went in hair-brained\r\nschemes of speculation and in liabilities contracted towards European\r\nsyndicates. Lastly, there was the conquest of the Upper Nile, and the\r\nattempted conquest of the kingdom of Abyssinia. To provide for all these\r\nimmense expenditures loans had to be raised, at first on a small scale\r\nwith local bankers and Greeks of Alexandria, and presently in more\r\nreckless fashion on the European Stock Exchange. Here his worst\r\ncounsellor and evil genius had been Nubar Pasha, the Armenian financier,\r\nwho, by a strange inversion of ideas, has come to be regarded by a\r\ncertain class of Egyptian opinion ignorant of history as an \"Egyptian\r\npatriot.\" Nubar was, however, in fact, the one man who, more than any\r\nother after Ismaïl himself, was responsible for Egypt's financial\r\nruin.[2] Commissioned by his master to find him money at any cost to\r\nmeet his extravagant wants, he raised loan after loan for him in Europe\r\non terms which realized for him hardly more than 60 per cent. of the\r\ncapital sums he inscribed himself for as debtor, while he, Nubar,\r\npocketed as commission several millions sterling. Of the ninety-six\r\nmillions nominally raised in this way, it has been calculated that only\r\nsome fifty-four reached Ismaïl's hands.\r\n\r\nAt the date which I am writing of the whole of this liability had not\r\nyet been incurred, but already the interest on the foreign debt amounted\r\nto four millions yearly, and to raise sufficient revenue to meet it and\r\nto carry on the administration and pay the huge expense of the\r\nAbyssinian war, the peasantry were being fleeced, as I have described,\r\nunder pressure of the whip, of their last hoarded piastres. Those who\r\ntalk lightly in these days of Ismaïl as a prince rather unfortunate than\r\nguilty, and to be pitied in some sort for the betrayal of the country\r\nfinancially to Europe, know nothing of the truth, nor do they realize\r\nthe enormity of the ruin inflicted by his selfish folly on his fellah\r\nsubjects. It has been calculated that the total cost of his reign to\r\nEgypt amounted to something like 400 millions sterling, nor is this in\r\nmy opinion an exaggerated estimate, for it had gathered in the whole of\r\nthe peasant savings of a number of prosperous years, and nearly the\r\nwhole of their agricultural stock besides the public debt, and left\r\nthem, moreover, indebted privately to the amount of something like\r\ntwenty millions to the Greek and other local usurers.\r\n\r\nSuch had been the causes of Egypt's misfortunes as I learned them at\r\nCairo in the spring of 1876. With regard to the origin of our financial\r\nintervention, it was certainly at that time Ismaïl's own foolish doing,\r\nand was not, as far as I know, prompted by any direct political motives\r\nin England. He most certainly applied to the English Government for\r\nfinancial assistance through Colonel Staunton in the autumn of 1875, and\r\nin a way that almost necessitated the assistance having a political\r\ncharacter. His reason for choosing England rather than France as the\r\nrecipient of his confidences was that at the time England was in a far\r\nbetter position financially to help him. The French Government was still\r\ncrippled by the expense of the war with Germany of 1870, and was really\r\nunable to assist him in any effectual way, while, as I have already\r\nsaid, the friendship long existing between England and Turkey, and the\r\nabstention of Englishmen so far from commercial intrigues in Egypt had\r\nprobably convinced him, in company with the general opinion of the\r\nMohammedan East, that England was a non-aggressive power as far as the\r\nOttoman Empire was concerned. Especially in the matter of the Suez Canal\r\nthe French Government had become an object of suspicion, and it was\r\ntherefore natural that when Ismaïl resolved to sell his shares in the\r\nCanal, it was to England rather than to France that he made the offer of\r\nthem. I remember well the impression produced in England at the time. It\r\nwas by no means one of general approval, and Disraeli was much blamed\r\nfor involving the Government in a transaction which had almost\r\nnecessarily political consequences. What is, I think, not generally\r\nknown, at any rate in Egypt, is that the agreement to purchase the\r\nKhedive's share for four millions sterling was made not by the English\r\nGovernment collectively, for Lord Derby was averse to it, but on the\r\npersonal responsibility of the Prime Minister who, without consulting\r\nhis colleagues other than Lord Derby, they being absent from London,\r\narranged with the London house of Rothschild to advance the money. What\r\nmay have been in Disraeli's mind politically about it I do not know, but\r\nI am very sure that Lord Derby, who was then at the Foreign Office, had\r\nno idea connected with it of political aggression. Lord Derby was a man\r\nwhose view of foreign policy was essentially one of non-intervention,\r\nnor had Disraeli as yet succeeded in indoctrinating his party with his\r\nown imperialistic ideas. The transaction, nevertheless, was one of evil\r\naugury for Egypt, and especially by reason of the part played in it by\r\nthe Rothschilds. As will be seen later, the financial connection of this\r\ntoo powerful Hebrew house with Egypt was the determining cause, six\r\nyears later, of England's military intervention.[3]\r\n\r\nMr. Cave's mission, which followed immediately on the purchase of the\r\nCanal shares, was without any question Ismaïl's doing also. The object\r\nin Ismaïl's mind, as is perfectly clear, when he asked for it, was still\r\nfurther to work the new mine of English political assistance he had\r\ndiscovered, with a view to further loans. He wanted to get some public\r\ntestimonial, in the shape of a published report, in favour of his\r\ncontinued solvency, and so to re-open to him the European stock\r\nexchanges. It was for this purpose that he applied to Colonel Staunton\r\nfor an English inquiry, and to a large extent he succeeded in his plan.\r\nMr. Cave, who was chosen by the English Government for the inquiry, was\r\na worthy and, I believe, quite disinterested man, but one who lacked\r\nexperience of the East, and so was specially easy to deceive; he lacked\r\nalso the fibre necessary for dealing quite courageously with all the\r\nfacts. Ismaïl, like most spendthrifts, when it came to the point of\r\nshowing his accounts, had always concealed a part of them, and, with the\r\nassistance of Ismaïl Sadyk, now gave a fanciful budget of his revenue,\r\nwhich Cave too readily accepted. He also allowed dust to be thrown in\r\nhis eyes to some extent as to the misery of the fellahin. It was the\r\nKhedive's plan to surround distinguished financial visitors whom he\r\ndesired to captivate with the show of great wealth. The mission was\r\nsplendidly entertained and taken about everywhere by the Khedive's\r\nofficers, who arranged things beforehand, and prevented as far as\r\npossible the nakedness of the land from being seen. Thus Cave's report,\r\nwhen it was published, gave only a partial truth. I think too that Cave\r\nmight have insisted, if he had been of a stronger character, on the fact\r\nwhich lay at the bottom of all Egypt's financial difficulty, namely,\r\nthat in justice, and indeed it might have been maintained in law,\r\nIsmaïl's debts were personal not public ones, and should have been so\r\ntreated. Cave's weakness on this point was the beginning of the\r\npolitical intervention in favour of the bondholders, and his report led\r\nby a necessary logic to the recognition of Ismaïl's debt as a public\r\nobligation. Sir Rivers Wilson, who immediately followed him, though a\r\nfar abler man, was equally inexperienced, and was at that time chosen, I\r\nbelieve, principally for his knowledge of the French language. I knew\r\nhim intimately, and I knew also, but in a less degree, Cave; and I\r\ncontinued in correspondence with Wilson for some years and am well\r\nacquainted with all his Egyptian doings.\r\n\r\nMy last recollection that winter at Cairo is of a barbaric banquet\r\noffered by the Khedive to Mr. Cave and the members of his commission, to\r\nwhich I was by accident invited. It was given in the Viceregal Kiosque\r\nat the Pyramids, and was one of those extravagant entertainments Ismaïl\r\nwas accustomed to dazzle European eyes with, nor was there anything\r\nwanting to point the contrast between the wealth of the entertainer and\r\nthe poverty of those at whose expense it was really given. The table was\r\nspread for us literally under the eyes of a starving multitude of\r\npeasants, the very peasants Mr. Cave was there to save from ruin. Yet\r\nnone of us seemed to feel the incongruity of it all. We feasted\r\nelaborately, and drank champagne of the best, and went our way, and it\r\nis only now that, with a better knowledge of the whole circumstances, I\r\nrecall the real character of the scene and recognize it for what it in\r\nall verity was with its waste and surrounding misery, a true presentment\r\nof the twin causes of the coming revolution.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Note.

It was then more the custom with European tourists\r\nthan it is now to go on from Egypt into Syria by way of the desert, and\r\nwe took once more to our camels and our tent life, and with the same\r\nBedouins who had escorted us from Suez, crossed the Suez Canal and made\r\na long tour through the Sinai peninsula and on by Akabah to Jerusalem.\r\nAs we were strange to the country we passed through, and were still very\r\nignorant of Arabic and had with us no dragoman, we got into some rather\r\nperilous adventures which are now amusing to recollect, though at the\r\ntime they were disagreeable enough. It is perhaps worth recording as a\r\ncurious accident of travel that as we were passing along the shore of\r\nthe Gulf of Akabah, which is fringed in places with coral reefs, we had\r\nstopped to examine these and to admire the wonderful colours, purple,\r\ngold, and vermilion, of the innumerable little fishes which live in\r\nthem. I was standing thus at the sea's edge, my gun, which I always then\r\ncarried, in my hand, when I saw a great commotion in the water near me\r\nand suddenly, before I was well aware of the cause, a large shark, one\r\nof a shoal, leaving the rest came straight to where I stood and was\r\nalready within a few yards of me before I understood what manner of fish\r\nit was or that I was the object of its attack. I had barely time to\r\nraise my gun when it turned, as these fishes do, on its side and rose\r\nhalf out of the water to take hold of me, and it was so near me when I\r\nfired that my charge of small shot killed it without the need of a\r\nsecond barrel, so that we were able, with the help of a lasso, to bring\r\nit high and dry on shore. It was a very large one, nearly ten feet long,\r\nand I do not doubt that if I had been a little more careless than I was\r\nI might have been carried from the rock into the sea by it. The\r\nincident brought home to me the danger which was once so common in\r\nEgypt for the fellahin from crocodiles in the Upper Nile, and I have\r\nbeen cautious in the matter of sea bathing ever since.\r\n\r\nWe fell into trouble, too, with certain Arabs on our way, through our\r\nignorance of the rules and customs of the desert. When camped outside\r\nAkabah, we received a visit from Abunjad the well-known Sheykh of the\r\nAlawin, a branch of the Howeytat tribe, who had the customary right of\r\nescorting travellers to Petra, and whom we managed to offend, with the\r\nresult that we ended by starting without escort or guides, our only\r\nnative companions being two Arab boys who had followed us from Mount\r\nSinai, and knew nothing of the northern country. With these we ventured\r\nnorth for Palestine, and presently ran short of water. The wells, when\r\nwe by fortune found them, proved to be almost dry, and it was only after\r\ngreat hardships under a burning sun that we at last reached an Arab\r\nencampment. Things had become so bad for us one night that we had\r\nresolved that if at noon on the following day we should have still\r\nfailed to find water we must abandon our baggage and push on on our best\r\ncamels for our bare lives to the settled country. An hour, however,\r\nbefore the time agreed on, the happy sound of an ass braying told us\r\nthat a camp must be near, and presently we spied an Arab child perched\r\non a mound, and from him, under some compulsion of fear, got knowledge\r\nof their watering place. It was a beautiful pool of rain water in the\r\nhollow of a rock, and here we lay long and quenched our thirst and\r\nfilled our goat skins. By good fortune it was, the men of the place,\r\nAzazimeh Arabs, were away or I doubt if we should have been allowed to\r\ntake so liberal a share of this \"Bounty of God,\" for they were in\r\npossession of the place and had sown a little barley field, as Bedouins\r\noften do on the Syrian frontier for the chance of rain, and this was all\r\ntheir drinking store till their corn should be ripe. Nor were they\r\notherwise than justly angry on their return, and we had to watch all\r\nnight for fear of an attack. It was not till morning that they came with\r\nshouts and menaces, but we had already loaded our camels, and being well\r\narmed held on our way. Knowing the ways of Bedouins better now, I feel\r\nsure that we need not thus have quarrelled with them, and that with a\r\nlittle explanation and payment for our disturbance of their rights they\r\nwould have received us well. But as it was, we were within a hair's\r\nbreadth of a serious misadventure, and deserve to be thankful that the\r\nfollowing day we at last reached the grass lands between Hebron and\r\nGaza. Here the more settled Arabs gave us a good reception, and having\r\nmade friends with them the memory of our past danger was soon forgotten.\r\nThis ended our travels for that year, and from Jerusalem we returned in\r\nthe early summer by the ordinary sea route to England.\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1877-8 saw us again in the East, this time with a larger\r\nprogram of adventure. We visited Aleppo, and passed down the Euphrates\r\nto Bagdad, and on our return journey made acquaintance with the great\r\nBedouin tribes of Mesopotamia and the Syrian Desert south of Palmyra. We\r\nbegan now to know something of the language, and to understand the\r\ncustoms of the Arabs, and made no more mistakes of the kind I have just\r\ndescribed. For this we were largely indebted to the wise counsels of the\r\nthen English Consul at Aleppo, Mr. Skene, who had had a large experience\r\nof Bedouins and their ways, and who taught us to approach them on their\r\nnobler side, and putting aside all fear to trust them as friends,\r\nappealing to their law of hospitality. The history of this most\r\ninteresting and successful journey has been very fully written by my\r\nwife in her \"Bedouin Tribes of the Euphrates,\" in reality a joint work,\r\nin which my first political views in regard to Arabian liberty may be\r\ntraced by those who care to seek them. My sympathy with the Arabs as\r\nagainst the Turks, with whom they were at chronic war, was the result of\r\nno pre-conceived idea, and still less of any political plan, but was\r\ncaused by what I saw, the extreme misgovernment of the settled districts\r\nby the Ottoman officials, and the happiness of the still independent\r\ntribes. It was a time of much local disorganization. The Russo-Turkish\r\nwar was in its last desperate throes at Kars and Plevna, and though our\r\ngood wishes were all with the Moslem armies as against the invading\r\nMuscovites, the sight of the miserable Syrian and Mesopotamian villagers\r\nbeing driven in chains as recruits to the sea coast moved us to anger\r\nagainst the imperial government, an anger which the hatred everywhere\r\nmanifested by the Arabs against the Turks daily intensified. It was\r\nimpossible in those days of far worse rule than now for any one with\r\nthe instinct of liberty to do otherwise than resent the Ottoman\r\nmisgovernment of its Arabic-speaking provinces. It was a government of\r\nforce and fraud, corrupt and corrupting to the last degree, where every\r\nevil engine was employed to enslave and degrade the people, where the\r\nMoslems were worse treated than the Christians, and where all alike were\r\npillaged by the Pashas. The Turk in his own home in Asia Minor has a\r\nnumber of honest and manly virtues, but as a master in a subject land he\r\nis too often a rapacious tyrant. Every vilayet had been bought with\r\nmoney at Constantinople, and the purchasing Valy was making what fortune\r\nhe could during his term of office out of those he was given to\r\nadminister. The land of Bagdad, under Ottoman rule, we had seen turned\r\ninto a wilderness, Damascus into a decaying city. Everywhere land was\r\nfalling out of cultivation, and the Government, like a moral plague, was\r\ninfecting the inhabitants with its own corruption. Can it be wondered at\r\nif, in view of these doings, we thought and spoke strongly, and, though\r\nour Government at the time was in open alliance with the Porte, our\r\nsympathies were with any scheme which might make the Arabian provinces\r\nindependent of the Empire?\r\n\r\nOn my return to England I find a record that on the 14th of May, 1878, I\r\nwas taken by my cousin, Philip Currie (now Lord Currie), who was then\r\nhis private secretary and one of the highest officials at the Foreign\r\nOffice, to see Lord Salisbury. Lord Salisbury had just accepted the\r\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs, and, though I knew nothing of it, must have\r\nbeen at the point of signing the famous secret treaty with the Sultan\r\nknown as the Cyprus Convention, and our journey in Arabian lands had\r\nexcited his interest to learn from me something about them. In answer to\r\nhis questions I told him all my thoughts very frankly, and I remember\r\nespecially suggesting to him the possible independence some day of\r\nSyria, and that it might join hands with Egypt against the common\r\nmisgovernment of their Turkish rulers. To this, however, he by no means\r\nresponded, saying that there could be no political connection between\r\nthe two provinces of the Ottoman Empire, and that the case of each stood\r\non a separate basis. He was more influenced by me, however, when I spoke\r\nunfavourably of the then much talked of Euphrates Valley Railway scheme,\r\nunder English guarantee, in which I saw a new danger to Arabian liberty,\r\nand I have reason to know that my arguments weighed with him to the\r\nextent that he shortly after refused all Foreign Office support to the\r\nenterprise, which has remained to this day abandoned. My conversation on\r\nthis occasion left me with a high opinion of Lord Salisbury's\r\nintelligence on Eastern matters, and, though his view of them has never\r\nbeen mine, I have always preserved a strong feeling of his personal\r\nintegrity, while it began a connection between us never intimate, but\r\nalways friendly on his part. To the last he allowed me to write to him\r\non these subjects, and though seldom agreeing he invariably responded to\r\nmy occasional letters with more than the usual official courtesy.\r\n\r\nAny hopes, however, that I may have had of persuading Lord Salisbury to\r\nmy views about the Arabs were speedily dispelled by his attitude that\r\nsummer at Berlin, when his policy was publicly proclaimed of\r\nguaranteeing to the Sultan the whole of his Asiatic dominions. The inner\r\nhistory of the Congress of Berlin as it affected Egypt is so curious,\r\nand at the same time so important, that it is necessary I should tell it\r\nhere as I learned it soon after the events had happened.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that the terrible winter of 1877-8 witnessed the\r\nfinal scenes of the war between Russia and Turkey, and that the spring\r\nof the new year found the Czar's army at the gates of Constantinople.\r\nThe same period had been one of extreme misery in Egypt. The Cave\r\nmission, whose arrival I had seen at Cairo, had been followed by other\r\nfinancial missions of less integrity, which had resulted in what was\r\nknown as the Goschen-Joubert arrangement of the Khedive Ismaïl's debts,\r\na truly leonine settlement, according to which the enormous yearly\r\ncharge of nearly seven millions sterling had been saddled on the\r\nEgyptian revenue, an amount which could only be wrung out of the ruined\r\nfellahin by forcing them, under the whip, to mortgage their lands to the\r\nGreek usurers who attended the tax-gatherers everywhere on their rounds\r\nthrough the villages. The last two Niles had been very bad ones, and\r\nthere had been famine in the land from the sea to Assouan. Many\r\nthousands of the villagers--men, women, and children--had died that\r\nwinter of sheer hunger. There had been nothing like it since the\r\nbeginning of the century. Under these circumstances it was clear that\r\neither the Khedive must go bankrupt or a reduction be made on the\r\ninterest of his debts, the Goschen-Joubert arrangement being abandoned.\r\nThe former course would have been the more equitable and by far the\r\nbetter one for the country, but in the foreign bondholders' interests\r\nthis was put aside, and a final attempt was made by these, this time\r\nsuccessfully, to secure the diplomatic intervention of the great Powers\r\nfor yet another settlement between Ismaïl and his creditors. The moment\r\nwas a favourable one as far as England was concerned, for it coincided\r\nwith the resolve of the English Government, under Disraeli's guidance,\r\nto play a forward political game, and take the leading part in the\r\naffairs of the Ottoman Empire. Lord Derby, who so far had gone\r\nunwillingly with his chief in his new policy of imperial adventure, now\r\nwould go no further with him and left the Foreign Office, and, as we\r\nhave seen, was replaced by Lord Salisbury. It was the signal of a\r\ngeneral diplomatic advance, not unaccompanied with menace. The British\r\nfleet was brought through the Dardanelles into the Sea of Marmora, the\r\nRussian army was overawed and prevented from entering Stamboul, and\r\nunder pressure of the English demonstration a treaty of peace was\r\nhurriedly drawn up between the Czar and the Sultan, the treaty of San\r\nStefano. On the side of Egypt, at the same time, an official Commission\r\nof Inquiry was appointed, which, though nominally international, was\r\nintended at the Foreign Office to be mainly an English one, my friend\r\nSir Rivers Wilson being chosen as English commissioner. His appointment\r\nwas, I believe, almost the first Lord Salisbury signed on taking the\r\ncommand in Downing Street.\r\n\r\nIt will also be remembered that two months later a secret convention was\r\nnegotiated at Constantinople by our then Ambassador, Sir Henry Layard, a\r\nman of great ability and knowledge of the East, who had acquired the\r\npersonal confidence of the still youthful Sultan, Abdul Hamid, in\r\naccordance with which the island of Cyprus was leased to England and a\r\nguarantee given to the Sultan of the integrity of all his Asiatic\r\nprovinces in lieu of promises of reform to be enforced by the presence\r\nin Asia Minor of certain ambulant English consuls, military men, who\r\nwere to give advice and report grievances. The idea of the Cyprus\r\nConvention, certainly in the minds of Disraeli and Salisbury who signed\r\nit and of Layard its true author, was to establish informally but none\r\nthe less effectually an English protectorate over Asiatic Turkey. The\r\nacquisition of Cyprus was in their view to be the smallest part of the\r\nbargain. The island was really of very little value to England as a\r\n_place d'armes_, and its selection for that purpose was due less to its\r\nfitness for the purpose than to a fantastic whim of Disraeli's, backed\r\nup by the roseate report of its potential wealth sent in by one of our\r\nconsuls who had an interest in the island. Disraeli many years before,\r\nas a quite young man, had in his novel \"Tancred\" advanced half jestingly\r\nthe idea of a great Asiatic empire under an English monarchy, and Cyprus\r\nwas to be specially included in it as recalling the historic fact that\r\nour English king, Richard Coeur de Lion, had once been also its\r\nsovereign. The whole thing was a piece of romantic fooling, but Disraeli\r\nloved to turn his political jests into realities and to persuade his\r\nEnglish followers, whom as a Jew he despised, in all seriousness to the\r\nways of his own folly. The really important object aimed at by Layard in\r\nthe Convention--and it was certainly his rather than Salisbury's, who\r\nwas new to office and whose experience the year before at Constantinople\r\nhad made him anything but a Turcophile--was to acquire the strategic\r\ncontrol of Asia Minor, which it was thought might be effected through\r\nthe ambulant consular posts it created. These were to supervise the\r\ncivil administration in the provinces, and see that the peasantry were\r\nnot too much robbed by those who farmed the taxes, and that the\r\nrecruiting grounds of the Ottoman army were not depopulated by\r\nmismanagement. Thus the advance of Russia to the Mediterranean might, it\r\nwas thought, be checked in Asia as their advance in Europe had been\r\nchecked at San Stefano.\r\n\r\nLooking back at the position now, with our knowledge of subsequent\r\nevents, and especially of the Sultan Abdul Hamid's character, it seems\r\nstrange both that the Sultan should have signed such a Convention which,\r\nif it had been carried out, would have put Asiatic Turkey as much into\r\nEnglish military hands as Egypt is to-day, or that our Foreign Office\r\nshould have believed in its success, and the epithet applied to it at\r\nthe time by Gladstone, who denounced it as an \"insane Convention,\" seems\r\nmore than justified. It must, however, be remembered that as regards\r\nAbdul Hamid he had really no choice, with the Russian army still at his\r\ndoors, but to accept the English alliance even if it should mean\r\ntutelage, and also that up to that point England had always proved a\r\nreliable and disinterested friend. Layard, on the other hand, was\r\nconscious of his personal ascendency at the palace, and he knew how\r\ngreat the prestige was in the Asiatic provinces of the English name. An\r\nEnglish Consul in those days held a position of absolute authority with\r\nValys and every class of Ottoman officials, and he may well have thought\r\nthat this could be indefinitely extended. The honour of England was so\r\ngreat in all Turkish eyes, and her policy towards the Moslem Empire had\r\nbeen so sympathetic that no suspicion existed anywhere of her having\r\nselfish plans. Layard, too, was himself a believer in the Turks, and he\r\nmay have had dreams of playing the part at Constantinople of _Maire du\r\nPalais_, which Lord Cromer has shown us an example of since at Cairo.\r\nNow, it is only astonishing that such English dreams should ever have\r\nbeen indulged in, or that by Moslems England's disinterestedness should\r\never have been trusted.\r\n\r\nLastly, it will be remembered that a month after the secret signature of\r\nthe Cyprus Convention, the great European Congress of 1878 met at\r\nBerlin. It had been called together principally at Disraeli's instance,\r\nand was to be the most important meeting of the Powers since the\r\nCongress of Paris. Like the earlier Congress its special object was to\r\ndetermine the fate of European Turkey and of the Christian subjects of\r\nthe Sultan, and on England's part to revise the treaty of San Stefano.\r\nOn its success in this direction Disraeli had staked his whole\r\nreputation as a statesman. England had intervened, according to his\r\nshowing, on the highest motives of policy as Turkey's best and most\r\ndisinterested friend, and it was on her approval as such by the other\r\ngreat Powers that depended his political position at home no less than\r\nabroad. So vital, indeed, to Disraeli did success at the Congress\r\nappear, that he went himself to it as chief plenipotentiary, taking Lord\r\nSalisbury, who was still new to diplomacy, with him as a second\r\nambassador, while Russia was represented by Prince Gortschakoff, France\r\nby M. Waddington, and Italy by Count Corti, Prince Bismarck presiding as\r\nhost over the whole august assemblage. I may add that Currie accompanied\r\nLord Salisbury as _précis_ writer on the occasion, and Lord Rowton,\r\nDisraeli.\r\n\r\nThe general proceedings of the Congress are of course well known, and I\r\nneed not here describe them, but what has never been published is the\r\nfollowing all important incident, of which, as already said, I learned\r\nthe particulars some little time after it occurred. The Congress\r\nassembled on the 13th of June, and as the matters to be discussed were\r\nof the highest moment, and there was not a little suspicion of each\r\nother among the plenipotentiaries in regard to a possible partition of\r\nTurkey, it was proposed at the outset that a preliminary declaration\r\nshould be made by each Ambassador affirming that his Government came to\r\nthe Congress unfettered by any secret engagement as to the questions in\r\ndispute. This declaration Disraeli and Salisbury, who seem to have been\r\ntaken by surprise, and were unprepared to make a clean breast of their\r\nsecret doings with the Sultan, had not the presence of mind to refuse,\r\nand no less than the others formally agreed and gave their word to--it\r\nmust be remembered that both were new to diplomacy. It may therefore be\r\nimagined how high a surprise it was, and scandal at Berlin when a few\r\nweeks later, 9th July, the text of the hidden Cyprus Convention was\r\npublished in London by one of the evening papers. One Marvin, an\r\nOriental traveller and linguist, but who had no official position at the\r\nForeign Office, had been imprudently employed as translator and copyist\r\nof the Turkish text by Currie, and had sold his information for a round\r\nsum to the \"Globe.\" The publication came as a thunderclap on our Embassy\r\nat Berlin, and though the authenticity of the text was promptly denied\r\nin London, the truth at Berlin could not long be concealed. Our two\r\nplenipotentiaries found themselves confronted with the unexplainable\r\nfact that they had perpetrated a gross breach of faith on their European\r\ncolleagues, and stood convicted of nothing less than a direct and\r\nrecorded lie. The discovery threatened to break up the Congress\r\naltogether. Prince Gortschakoff declared himself outraged, and he was\r\njoined in his anger on the part of France by M. Waddington. Both gave\r\nwarning that they would withdraw at once from the sittings, and M.\r\nWaddington went so far as to pack up his trunks to leave Berlin. The\r\nsituation was an ugly one, and was only saved by the cynical good\r\noffices of Bismarck, on whom Disraeli, as a fellow cynic and a man of\r\nbold ideas, had made a sympathetic impression. The German Chancellor,\r\nas \"honest broker,\" brought about the following compromise, with which\r\nM. Waddington declared himself satisfied. It was agreed between the\r\nFrench and English plenipotentiaries:\r\n\r\n1. That as a compensation to France for England's acquisition of Cyprus,\r\nFrance should be allowed on the first convenient opportunity, and\r\nwithout opposition from England, to occupy Tunis.\r\n\r\n2. That in the financial arrangements being made in Egypt, France should\r\nmarch _pari passu_ with England; and,\r\n\r\n3. That England should recognize in a special manner the old French\r\nclaim of protecting the Latin Christians in Syria.\r\n\r\nIt was in consideration of Disraeli's surrender on these three points\r\nthat Waddington consented to remain at Berlin and join the other\r\nambassadors in arranging the Balkan settlement, which eventually was\r\ncome to more or less on the lines of the English proposals. The price\r\nthus paid to France by Disraeli of a province belonging to his ally the\r\nSultan, it is curious to reflect, enabled that statesman to return a\r\nlittle later to London and claim a public triumph, with the famous boast\r\nin his mouth that he had brought back \"peace with honour.\" A curious\r\nhistory truly, and deserving to be specially noted as marking the point\r\nof departure for England of a new policy of spoliation and treacherous\r\ndealing in the Levant foreign to her traditional ways. To the Cyprus\r\nintrigue are directly or indirectly referable half the crimes against\r\nOriental and North African liberty our generation has witnessed. It\r\nsuggested the immediate handing over of Bosnia to Austria. It helped to\r\nfrustrate a sound settlement in Macedonia. It put Tunis under the heel\r\nof France, and commenced the great partition of Africa among the\r\nEuropean Powers, with the innumerable woes it has inflicted on its\r\nnative inhabitants, from Bizerta to Lake Chad, and from Somaliland to\r\nthe Congo. Above all it destroyed at a critical moment all England's\r\ninfluence for good in the Ottoman Empire. It embittered Moslem hearts\r\nagainst her in 1881 and 1882, and, as I will show, was a powerful factor\r\nin the more violent events of those troubled years in Egypt. Also it\r\nmost certainly defeated its own end in Asiatic Turkey if England's\r\nco-operation in reform was really contemplated. The doings at the\r\nCongress opened the Sultan's eyes to the danger there might be in any\r\nEnglish co-operation, and also beyond question hardened his heart to a\r\npolicy contrary to English advice, and in which he has been only too\r\nsuccessful, that of suppressing all liberty and self-government among\r\nhis own Turkish subjects. To it the Liberal party at Constantinople owes\r\nmore than to anything else its ruthless persecution, and it is even not\r\ntoo much to say that whatever woes have been inflicted on the Armenians\r\nhave been caused by the false hopes raised at Berlin of their\r\nemancipation by England's moral help, a help her own immorality has made\r\nher powerless to give. The immediate effect in Egypt of the compromise\r\ncome to with M. Waddington was the despatch of a telegram from Berlin to\r\nWilson at Alexandria ordering him, much to his chagrin and surprise, to\r\nsee that in all the financial appointments made in connection with his\r\nofficial inquiry, France should receive an absolutely equal share. It\r\nwas, indeed, though unknown to Wilson at the time, the determining\r\ncause, a year later, of the Anglo-French condominium.[4]\r\n\r\nPublic affairs were in this position when in the autumn of that same\r\nyear, 1878, I found myself once more upon my road eastwards. My journey\r\nof the winter before to Bagdad, and especially the success I had had in\r\na matter much more interesting to me than any politics, the purchase and\r\nbringing safely home of the Arab mares which were to form the nucleus of\r\nmy now well-known stud at Crabbet, had roused considerable interest and\r\ncuriosity in England, and I had spent the summer preparing my wife's\r\njournal for publication, and it was now in the Press. We were not\r\ncontent, however, with this, and had made up our minds to a new\r\nexpedition still more adventurous than any we had yet attempted, and\r\nwere on our way back to Damascus, from which starting point we designed\r\nto penetrate into central Arabia and visit Nejd, the original home and\r\nbirthplace of the Arabian horse. Our sea-voyage from Marseilles would\r\ntouch at Alexandria, and it so happened that I found on board the\r\nMessageries steamer at Marseilles my friend Sir Rivers Wilson who had\r\njust been appointed Finance Minister in Egypt, and in his company we\r\nmade the voyage. During the six days' passage I had ample opportunity to\r\nlearn from him all that had happened during the past two years at Cairo,\r\nand the tale he told me of the condition of the country was a very\r\nterrible one. I remember well his account of that most dramatic of the\r\nmany crimes of the Khedive Ismaïl, his murder of the Mufettish Ismaïl\r\nSadyk, an act of treachery which more than any other alienated from the\r\nKhedive the allegiance, I will not say of his Egyptian subjects at\r\nlarge, for that he had already lost, but even of that group of slaves\r\nand servants by which he was surrounded.\r\n\r\nIsmaïl Sadyk was an Algerian by birth but had come at an early age to\r\nEgypt, and had by his abilities risen in the viceregal service, his\r\nfirst connection with the Court having been, I believe, under Abbas I as\r\na superintendent of his stud. Under Saïd and Ismaïl he had served in\r\nvarious official capacities and had made himself, as we have seen,\r\nIsmaïl's _âme damnée_ in the work of extracting their last piastres from\r\nthe fellahin. With all his cruelties to them--and he had shown\r\ninexhaustible ingenuity in devising means for their spoliation--he had\r\nmaintained a certain honourable repute at Cairo as an Arab gifted with\r\nthe traditional virtue of generosity and a large liberality in spending\r\nthe wealth he had acquired, and so as an old man was not unpopular. For\r\nthe last few years of his life he had been Finance Minister, and to\r\nIsmaïl had always proved himself a devoted and faithful servant. Ismaïl\r\nhad nevertheless betrayed him a few months before the time I am writing\r\nof basely to his death, and under circumstances so revolting that the\r\nEgyptian world, used as it was to crime in high places, had been shocked\r\nand confounded. The Khedive's motive had been the wholly base and\r\nselfish one of screening himself by casting upon his too faithful\r\nMinister the blame of certain frauds he had himself committed, and he\r\nhad insured his silence by having the old man murdered almost in his own\r\npresence.\r\n\r\nThe details given me by Wilson were as follows: Ismaïl had been in the\r\nhabit, in his dealings with the various European commissioners whom he\r\nhad from time to time invited to inquire into his financial affairs, of\r\nconcealing as far as was possible from them the extreme truth of his\r\nsenseless extravagances, and with his Minister Ismaïl Sadyk's help had\r\nonce more now, as on previous occasions, presented to the new official\r\ncommission a false statement of his debts. The pressure, however, on him\r\nwas severe, as the commission had received a hint, if I remember\r\nrightly, from Riaz Pasha, that they were being befooled on this point,\r\nand he, fearing that the whole truth would come out, and when the matter\r\nshould be fully gone into by the commission his Minister might tell the\r\nfacts, determined to be beforehand with him and make of him his\r\nscapegoat and victim. He took the execution of the deed into his own\r\nhands. It was his custom with his Minister, with whom he was on the\r\nclosest possible terms of personal friendship, to call sometimes for the\r\nold man in the afternoon at the Finance Office and take him for a drive\r\nwith him to Shubra or to one or another of his palaces; and so on this\r\noccasion he did, and, suspecting nothing, the Minister mounted with him\r\nand they drove together to the Jesireh Palace and there got down and\r\nentered. No sooner, however, were they inside than Ismaïl on some\r\npretext left him alone in one of the saloons and immediately sent to him\r\nhis two younger sons Husseyn and Hassan and his aide-de-camp, Mustafa\r\nBey Fehmy, when the princes struck and insulted the unarmed Minister and\r\nhustled him on board one of the viceregal steamers which was lying with\r\nsteam up beside the quay, and there, though not without a vigorous\r\nresistance, the old man was despatched. According to Wilson, the actual\r\ndoer of the deed was Mustafa Bey, acting under the Khedive's order, and\r\nhe added that the truth had been disclosed through the young\r\naide-de-camp falling ill of fever soon after and telling it in his\r\ndelirium. I have reason, however, to believe that as far as Mustafa's\r\npersonal act went this was a mistake, though the rest of the facts have\r\nbeen fully confirmed to me, and that the Mufettish was handed over by\r\nMustafa to Ishak Bey, in whose charge he perished, though whether at\r\nonce or a little later is uncertain. Some say that Ismaïl Sadyk was\r\nthrown as many another had been thrown, with a stone tied to his feet\r\ninto the Nile, others that he was conveyed alive as far as to between\r\nWaddy Halfa and Dongola and there strangled. All that is quite beyond\r\ndispute is that once on board the steamer he was never seen again alive,\r\nand that the steamer having gone up the river, it was some weeks later\r\nofficially announced that the Mufettish was away in Upper Egypt for a\r\nchange of air and ultimately that he had there taken to drink and died.\r\nIt is also certain that Mustafa, a mild young man and unused to scenes\r\nof violence, and being himself, as the Mufettish was, of Algerine\r\nextraction, was so horrified at the _rôle_ he had been ordered to play\r\nin it that he had a long and dangerous illness. It was this experience\r\nthat a year later caused him to take the part he did against his master\r\nIsmaïl and ultimately to join Arabi in the earlier phases of the\r\nrevolution of 1881-2. He is the same Mustafa Fehmy who has for so many\r\nyears filled the office of Prime Minister in Egypt.\r\n\r\nOf all these things we talked as we sat day after day on the deck of the\r\nMessageries steamer, and, especially, of course, of Wilson's own\r\nimportant mission as Ismaïl Sadyk's successor. Wilson's hopes at that\r\ntime were high regarding his own administrative success, and he showed a\r\nkeen appreciation of the responsibility of the charge he had undertaken\r\nof restoring Egypt to prosperity and rescuing the fellahin from their\r\nfinancial bondage, but he was also fully aware of the difficulties which\r\nlay before him. The Khedive's character he had learned to understand,\r\nand he was prepared to find in him an astute and unscrupulous opponent.\r\nBut he counted on his own _bonhomie_, tact, and knowledge of the world\r\nto be able to live on friendly terms with him, and to avoid what\r\npersonal risks he might run. He relied too on his French education, for\r\nhe had lived much at Paris, to preserve intact the dual character of the\r\nAnglo-French Ministry, of which he formed a part, and above all he\r\nrelied on Nubar. In Nubar he reposed unlimited confidence, believing him\r\nto be a heaven-born Eastern statesman, and one devoted to English\r\ninterests. He had, moreover, behind him, as he thought, the full support\r\nof the London Foreign Office, and what was perhaps even a stronger stay\r\nin Europe, the interest and power of the house of Rothschild. On this\r\nlast he knew he could rely, for he had just persuaded them on his\r\npassage through Paris to advance that fatal loan of nine millions on the\r\nKhedivial Domains which was to bind them to the cause of European\r\nintervention whenever necessary on the part of the bondholders. To\r\nmyself, who knew Wilson well, though I sympathized to the full with his\r\nhumanitarian hopes and personal aspirations, there seemed to be certain\r\nelements of doubt in his position which did not augur altogether well\r\nfor his success.\r\n\r\nWe parted at Alexandria in good hope that all would go well with him in\r\na mission so much one of despair to a ruined state, but with misgivings.\r\nThe difficulties before him we both guessed would be immense, and in\r\nspite of his excellent qualities of heart and head and his great _savoir\r\nvivre_, I had my fears for him. The event more than justified my\r\nforebodings, and in a shorter time than either of us could have thought\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nSir Rivers Wilson's brief career as Finance Minister in Egypt failed\r\nthrough many causes. It was of ill omen, I think, at the very outset\r\nthat it should have commenced with a new and heavy loan, the proceeds of\r\nwhich it is difficult to find were put to any serious purpose. Errors of\r\nadministration, too, there certainly were which inflicted great\r\ninjustice on the people, and which, as will be seen later, prepared the\r\nway for a general discontent. It is not, however, necessary for me to go\r\ninto these, for they are matters of notoriety to be found in the Blue\r\nBooks. Wilson's excuse for them must be found in the fact that in all\r\nmatters of internal policy he trusted absolutely for guidance to Nubar,\r\nand that he greatly overrated Nubar's power to deal with them. If Wilson\r\nhad been more of a statesman and less of a financier he would not have\r\nblundered as he did into political difficulties which, with a little\r\nmore experience of the arts of government, might have been easily\r\navoided. Nubar was a weak reed on which to lean. As a Christian and an\r\nalien it was not difficult for one so astute as Ismaïl to rouse\r\nMohammedan opinion against him, and when, thinking only of restoring the\r\nfinancial equilibrium, Wilson began a series of crude retrenchments\r\namong the native officials, a discontented class was at once brought\r\ninto existence which gave the Khedive his opportunity of diverting the\r\npopular ill-will from himself to his Christian Ministers. What made it\r\nthe more easy for him was that in these retrenchments no European\r\nsalaries were cut down. The agreement with France had made it imperative\r\nthat each Englishman employed in Egypt should be duplicated with a\r\nFrenchman, and Wilson did not dare touch one of them. Wilson, as holding\r\nthe purse strings, had to bear the odium of all this.\r\n\r\nNor did he, in spite of his good intentions, succeed in relieving the\r\npeasantry in any way of their burdens. It was an essential part of his\r\nprogram that the Khedive should remain solvent, and that meant that the\r\ninterest on the enormous debt should be punctually paid. The nine\r\nmillions advanced by the Rothschilds went mostly in paying the more\r\nurgently immediate calls, and not a tax was reduced or a demand\r\nremitted. On the contrary, the _régime_ of the whip went on, even more\r\nmercilessly than before, in the villages, and an additional terror was\r\nintroduced into the agricultural situation by the institution, at great\r\nexpense and most futilely carried out, of a new revenue survey, under\r\nEnglish direction, which was interpreted as the prelude of a still\r\nenhanced land-tax. Lastly, the project, lightly suggested by Wilson, of\r\nrescinding the Moukabalah arrangement, which would have meant\r\nconfiscation by the Government of landed property representing something\r\nlike fifteen millions, disturbed every landowner's mind, and led to the\r\nbelief that even worse things might be expected of the English Minister\r\nthan any they had suffered from his predecessors. It seems to me\r\nastonishing now with my better knowledge of Egypt that any one so\r\nintelligent and well meaning as Wilson undoubtedly was should have\r\nfallen into such errors, and I half suspect that some of them were\r\nsuggested to him for his discomfiture by the Khedive himself. The climax\r\nof the Wilson-Nubar political unwisdom was reached when, without any\r\narrears of pay being given them, the native army, including 2,500\r\nofficers, began to be disbanded. This put the alien Ministry finally\r\ninto the Khedive's hands, and it was a chance Ismaïl did not throw away.\r\n\r\nThe history of the _émeute_ of February, 1879, which overthrew the\r\nNubar-Wilson Ministry, needs to be recounted here as it really happened,\r\nfor the truth about it will not be found in any published history. The\r\nKhedive was, as we have seen, anxious to divert the popular hatred with\r\nwhich he was regarded in Egypt from himself to his new Ministers, and he\r\nwas also most desirous of ridding himself of their tutelage. By an Act\r\ncalled the Rescript of 1878 he had abdicated his personal control of the\r\nrevenue and the administration into their hands, and used as he was for\r\neighteen years to absolute power in Egypt it irked him already to have\r\nlost it. He had only signed the Rescript as an alternative to\r\nbankruptcy, and this being averted he did not intend to stand by the\r\nletter of his bond. Being also an astute judge of character, he had seen\r\nat once the weakness of the Ministry, how Wilson and his French\r\ncolleague, de Blignières, depended, in their foreign ignorance of\r\nEgyptian things, altogether on Nubar for their knowledge how to act, and\r\nalso how helpless Nubar himself was as a Christian to rule a Mohammedan\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nNubar was known to the Mohammedan official class as an Armenian\r\nadventurer, who had enriched himself as agent of the loan-mongers of\r\nEurope at the public expense, and to the fellahin as the author of the\r\nInternational Tribunals, an institution extolled by foreigners, but to\r\nthem especially odious as having laid them more than any other agency\r\nhad done in bondage to the Greek usurers. As these Courts were then\r\nadministered in Egypt, a fellah who had once put his signature to any\r\npaper for money borrowed could be sued before foreign judges according\r\nto a foreign procedure and in a foreign language, without the smallest\r\nchance, if he was a poor man, of defending himself, or of showing, as\r\nwas often the case, that the figures had been altered or the whole paper\r\na forgery, and he might be deprived of his land and of all he possessed\r\nbefore he well knew what the claim made on him rightly was. Nubar was\r\nknown especially for this, and was without following of any native kind\r\nor supported by any opinion but that of the foreign commercial class of\r\nAlexandria. It was therefore through Nubar that Ismaïl saw the new\r\n_régime_ could be most easily attacked, and most surely reduced to\r\nimpotence. All that was needed to overthrow it was a public native\r\ndemonstration against the unpopular Christian, and this the discontent\r\nof the 2,500 officers cashiered and cheated of pay and pension made it a\r\nvery easy matter to arrange.\r\n\r\nIsmaïl's chief agents in getting up the _émeute_ of February\r\nwere Shahin Pasha, one of his own Court servants, and Shahin's\r\nbrother-in-law, Latif Effendi Selim, who, as Director of the Military\r\nCollege, held a position specially advantageous for the purpose. By\r\nthese a demonstration of the students of the college was arranged, which\r\nat the hour named marched through the streets of Cairo announcing their\r\nintention of demanding the dismissal of the obnoxious Ministry, and they\r\nwere joined by the crowd and especially by such of the cashiered\r\nofficers as chanced to be upon their way, and it was so arranged that\r\nthey should arrive at the Government offices at the hour when the\r\nMinisters were about to leave it. There they found Nubar Pasha in the\r\nact of stepping into his carriage, and they insulted and assaulted him,\r\nNubar's moustache being pulled and his ears boxed. A general popular\r\ndemonstration followed, and presently the first regiment of the\r\nKhedivial Guard under its colonel Ali Bey Fehmy, which had been held\r\nin readiness, appeared upon the scene, and a little after the\r\nKhedive himself. A few shots were then fired over the heads of the\r\ndemonstrators, and the Khedive having ordered them to their homes the\r\ncrowd dispersed. The program, arranged beforehand with Ali Bey, had been\r\nsuccessfully carried out, and the Khedive was able to claim of the\r\nEnglish and French Consuls, to whom he immediately appealed, the\r\nnecessity of Nubar's dismissal, and to persuade them that but for his\r\npowerful intervention and authority with the people worse things would\r\nhave happened. Nubar therefore was advised to resign, and a Moslem\r\nofficial of the Khedive's choosing, Ragheb Pasha, was allowed to be\r\nnamed Prime Minister in his place. With Ragheb, a special adherent of\r\nhis own, at the Ministry of the Interior, Ismaïl knew that Wilson and de\r\nBlignières would be powerless to administer the country, and that their\r\nfall also must speedily follow.\r\n\r\nNubar having been thus successfully disposed of, Wilson's tenure of\r\noffice as Finance Minister became, as the Khedive had calculated, all\r\nbut impossible, and his fall was hastened by extraneous circumstances.\r\nOur then Consul-General in Egypt, Vivian (afterwards Lord Vivian and\r\nAmbassador at Rome) had been estranged from Wilson by a personal quarrel\r\nwhich had taken place between them, and when in his political\r\ndifficulties Wilson appealed to him for support, the support was\r\ngrudgingly given or altogether withheld. Wilson's final discomfiture\r\nsoon followed; an incident, somewhat similar to that of February, was\r\narranged in March at Alexandria, on which occasion he and his wife were\r\nhustled and hurt by the mob, and when Wilson laid his complaint before\r\nthe Foreign Office it refused him any efficient backing for redress. He\r\nwas advised, as Nubar had been, to resign, and, there being no other\r\ncourse left him, he retired from office and returned to Europe.\r\n\r\nI have an interesting letter from Wilson of this date. Writing on 30th\r\nApril, 1879, he says: \"You will I daresay have heard that I have been\r\nupset by that little scoundrel the Khedive. He didn't quite have me\r\nassassinated, as you not without reason imagined might be the case, but\r\nhe had me attacked in the street and very roughly handled, and now he\r\nhas had the satisfaction of getting rid of me altogether, H. M.'s Govt.,\r\nwith their usual loyalty to their agents, having left me to my fate.\r\nCrepy Vivian is the cause and chief abettor of this sudden overthrow of\r\narrangements which he was instructed specially to protect. Partly from\r\njealousy, and a good deal from want of intelligence, with the addition\r\nof a great deal of vanity, he went at once into the Khedive's camp. His\r\nHighness, whose highest art of government lies in the disunion of the\r\npeople he has to deal with, might reasonably have expected to make a\r\nsplit between Blignières and myself, or between one or both of us and\r\nNubar, but in his wildest dreams he never could have hoped that the\r\nEnglish Consul-General would become his toady and instrument for the\r\noverthrow of the Ministry imposed on him by an English Government.... We\r\nleave on the 6th and shall get to London about the 15th. I am glad to be\r\nout of the place now. The whole thing is going to the devil. The country\r\nis pestilential with corruption. The French and English Governments seem\r\nafraid of acting, and for the moment the Khedive rides rampant and is\r\nbleeding the country to death. The smash cannot be delayed, but in the\r\ninterval it is dreadful to think of the mischief and misery that are\r\nbeing worked.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[4] I have given the story of the arrangement made with Waddington as I\r\nheard it first from Lord Lytton at Simla in May, 1879. The details were\r\ncontained in a letter, which he showed me, written to him from Berlin,\r\nwhile the Congress was still sitting, by a former diplomatic colleague\r\nand have since been confirmed to me from more than one quarter, though\r\nwith variations. In regard to the main feature of the agreement, the\r\narrangement about Tunis, I had it very plainly stated to me in the\r\nautumn of 1884 by Count Corti who had been Italian Ambassador at the\r\nCongress. According to his account, the shock of the revelation to\r\nDisraeli had been so great, that he took to his bed, and for four days\r\ndid not appear at the sittings, leaving Lord Salisbury to explain\r\nmatters as he best could. He said there had been no open rupture with\r\nWaddington, the case having been submitted by Waddington to his fellow\r\nambassadors, who agreed that it was one that could not publicly be\r\ndisputed, \"Il faut la guerre ou se taire.\" The agreement was a verbal\r\none between Waddington and Salisbury, but was recorded in a dispatch\r\nsubsequently written by the French Ambassador in London, in which he\r\nreminded the latter of the conversation held in Berlin, and so secured\r\nits acknowledgment in writing.\r\n\r\nSee Appendix VI. as to the Berlin Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTRAVELS IN ARABIA AND INDIA\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile these important events had been happening in Egypt I had been\r\naway, still travelling with my wife on our new adventure in Central\r\nArabia, far removed from all knowledge of them or of the affairs of the\r\noutside world.\r\n\r\nOn our way to Damascus, where we were to begin our serious campaign, we\r\nhad stopped for some days in Cyprus, being curious to look at the new\r\nEnglish possession, just acquired at the cost of so much scandal, which\r\nwe found receiving its first lessons in English administration at the\r\nhands of Sir Garnet Wolseley. The island was still in its summer heat,\r\nno rain having fallen, and seemed to us little better than a dusty\r\nwilderness. We called on Wolseley at his government house at Nicosia,\r\nand found him making the best of a rather forlorn and very isolated\r\nposition. In his talk with us he put as good a face as he could on the\r\noutlook of this latest \"gem of Empire,\" but it was clear that in his\r\nprofessional mind the island had no great merit, and was rather in the\r\nnature of that gross of spectacles brought home from the fair we read of\r\nin the \"Vicar of Wakefield.\" It was difficult, indeed, to see what use\r\nit could be put to, or how it could be made to pay its cost of\r\nmanagement. Its acquisition had already begun to bring discredit to the\r\nEnglish name, and it was generally spoken of, we found among the\r\nMohammedans of Syria, as a _backshish_ taken by England for services\r\nrendered to the Sultan.\r\n\r\nAt Damascus we met several interesting personages, among others the old\r\nhero of the Algerian war with France, Seyyid Abd-el-Kader, and that\r\nother in some ways hero, the ex-leader of the Turkish constitutional\r\nparty, Midhat Pasha. My impression of the latter, much as I was inclined\r\nto sympathize with Mohammedan reform, was not favourable. Personally he\r\nwas unimpressive, of no distinguished appearance, and with a certain\r\nboastful and self-assertive manner which suggested vanity as a leading\r\ncharacteristic. In a long conversation I had with him on the subject of\r\nOttoman regeneration, I found his ideas shallow and of that commonplace\r\nEuropean kind which so often in the East do service for original thought\r\nand depth of conviction. His ideas of reform for the Empire, and of the\r\nSyrian vilayet of which he had just been appointed Valy, as he expounded\r\nthem to me, were wholly material ones, the construction of railroads,\r\ncanals, and tramways, all excellent things in their way, but leaving\r\nuntouched the real necessities of the administration and which, as he\r\nhad no funds whatever at his disposal for public works, were in his own\r\nprovince quite illusory. Of the larger matters of economy, justice, and\r\nprotection for the poor, he did not speak, nor did he show himself in\r\nthe smallest degree in sympathy with the people of the province he had\r\ncome to govern. Indeed, he was imbued with more than the usual Turkish\r\ncontempt for everything Arabian, which he took no pains to conceal, and\r\nhis avowed methods in dealing with the Bedouins were brutal in the\r\nextreme. This naturally repelled me. Nevertheless I cannot help\r\nregretting now that I did not make some effort at the time of his\r\nmisfortunes to rouse public feeling in his favour in England, when such\r\nmight have perhaps saved him from the terrible punishment he suffered at\r\nthe Sultan's hands. I did not, however, at that time know all the facts,\r\nand it was only in 1884 that I learned, from a source on which I could\r\nrely, the true history of Midhat's trial on the false charge of murder\r\nbrought against him three years before. This is so important a matter\r\nthat I make no excuse for relating it here in detail.\r\n\r\nIt may be remembered that when I was at Constantinople in 1873 I had\r\nbeen cared for during a serious illness by Doctor Dickson, the then\r\nphysician of the British Embassy, with whom I had formed a very pleasant\r\nintimacy. This worthy old man, who had already at that time been some\r\nthirty-five years in Turkey, had become thoroughly orientalized and\r\npossessed a wider experience and more complete knowledge of all things\r\nOttoman than perhaps any other Englishman then living. He had, moreover,\r\na loyal sympathy with the people among whom he had so long lived, and\r\nhad retained with it a very high integrity and sense of old-fashioned\r\nEnglish honour, which made him the most capable and reliable witness\r\npossible in regard to events which had come under his notice. His\r\nevidence, therefore, on what I am about to relate may be considered as\r\nabsolutely final on the matter it touches. In 1884 I was again at\r\nConstantinople, and it was then that he gave it me; and it seemed to me\r\nso important as a corrective to history that I at once on the day I\r\nheard it wrote it down. It is textually as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Nov. 3, 1884. Doctor Dickson was sent by the English Embassy to\r\ninvestigate the circumstances of Abd-el-Aziz' death; and he gave us a\r\nmost precise account of all he had seen at the palace that day. The\r\nparty of doctors consisted of a Greek, Marco Pasha, of an old Englishman\r\nwho had been Lord Byron's doctor, and several others. They found the\r\nbody in the guard house and examined it carefully. The Sultan was\r\ndressed in a silk shirt, such as the _caïquejis_ wear, plain without\r\nstripes, and pink silk trousers. When stripped the body was found\r\nwithout scratch or bruise, 'the most beautiful body in the world,' with\r\nthe exception of the cuts in the two arms on the inside where the\r\narteries are. The cut on the left arm was deep to the bone and Dr.\r\nDickson had put his finger into the wound. That on the right was\r\nimperfect and the artery was not severed. They were manifestly the cause\r\nof death. The other doctors were satisfied with this examination and\r\nwent away; but Dr. Dickson and the other English doctor insisted upon\r\ntaking the evidence of the Sultan's mother, and this was her account:\r\nAbd-el-Aziz had twice since his deposition tried to destroy himself,\r\nonce by trying to throw himself down a well, once into the Bosphorus,\r\nbut had been prevented; and the Sultana had been warned to give him no\r\ninstrument with which he could effect his purpose. When therefore he had\r\nasked her for a mirror and scissors to trim his beard she had chosen the\r\nsmallest pair she possessed, and thought it impossible he should harm\r\nhimself with them. She occupied the room next to his, and there were\r\nalways one or two girls on watch when she was not herself with him. It\r\nhappened, however, that one afternoon he had ordered the girls out and\r\nbolted the door, saying he wished to be alone; and the girls did not\r\ndare disobey. But when half an hour was passed they came and told her,\r\nand at first she was not alarmed, but bade them wait at the door and\r\nlisten. Then they came back and said they heard nothing, and at the end\r\nof the hour she herself went, followed by her women, and pushed the door\r\nopen. They found the Sultan leaning on his side on the sofa dead in this\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n[Here in my journal is a sketch.]\r\n\r\n\"The sofa and the curtains of the room were of velvet, red on yellow\r\nground. And Dr. Dickson's colleague examined the place and found the\r\nleft arm of the sofa saturated with blood, and a great pool of\r\ncoagulated blood on the floor beneath; also on the middle of the sofa a\r\nsmall mark of blood corresponding with the wound on the right arm, but\r\nthough he examined carefully there was not a speck elsewhere than close\r\nto the sofa, so that it was impossible there could have been any\r\nstruggle or murder. As the Sultana said: 'If he was murdered the\r\nmurderer must have been myself, for I was in the next room and nobody\r\nelse could have come near him.' At the trial of Midhat and the rest for\r\nmurder, they produced a linen, not a silk, shirt, with a cut in the side\r\nas from a sword thrust, a pair of green or yellow trousers, and a fur\r\ndressing gown, not those which were on the corpse, and chintz covers of\r\nthe sofa and chintz curtains sprinkled with blood, not those of the room\r\nwhere the body was found. Dr. Dickson had thereupon written a protest\r\nstating what he knew, and had given it to Lord Dufferin, begging him to\r\nhave it handed as evidence to the President of the Court. But Dufferin\r\nwould not interfere without instructions, and while he telegraphed, or\r\npretended to telegraph, Midhat was condemned. Marco Pasha, he says, must\r\nhave been induced to give the evidence he did. The story of men having\r\nbeen seen climbing in and out of the window was ridiculous, as it was so\r\nhigh from the ground the men must have broken their legs jumping out.\r\nDr. Dickson is a very precise old gentleman, and the sort of witness\r\nwhose evidence would be accepted by any jury in the world. I therefore\r\nentirely believe his account, improbable as at first sight it seems,\r\nthat a Sultan should not have been murdered and should have committed\r\nsuicide. Midhat and Damad died in chains at Taif some months ago, having\r\nbeen starved to death. Midhat's end was hastened by a carbuncle, but he\r\nwas none the less made away with. The Sheykh el Islam has also recently\r\ndied there, who gave the _fetwa_ authorizing Abd-el-Aziz' deposition.\r\nThis act of terror has given Abdul Hamid the absolute power he now\r\nholds.\"\r\n\r\nAnother person of importance to my narrative whom we met that autumn of\r\n1878 at Damascus was Sir Edward Malet, at that time Secretary of Embassy\r\nat Constantinople, and who was making a tour of Syria partly for his\r\namusement, partly to gather information. During my diplomatic career I\r\nhad served twice under his excellent father, and had been very intimate\r\nwith his family and with himself from the days when we were both\r\nattachés, and I am therefore able to speak of his character, which has\r\nbeen strangely misunderstood in Egypt, from intimate personal knowledge.\r\nMalet was a man of fair ordinary abilities, gifted with much industry,\r\ncaution, and good sense. Having been born, so to say, in diplomacy and\r\nput into the service by his father when he was only sixteen, he had had\r\na thoroughly professional training, and, as far as the traditions and\r\nusages of his work went, he was an entirely competent public servant. He\r\ncould write a good plain despatch, and one which might be trusted to say\r\nnot a word more than his instructions warranted, and would commit his\r\nGovernment to nothing not intended. He had the talents which are perhaps\r\nthe most useful under the ordinary circumstances of the service to which\r\nhe belonged, prudence, reticence and a ready self-effacement, those in\r\nfact which should distinguish a discreet family solicitor,--and the duty\r\nof a diplomatist, except in very rare cases, is in no way different from\r\nthat of a solicitor. Imagination, however, Malet had none, nor\r\ninitiative, nor any power of dealing on his own responsibility with\r\noccasions requiring strong action and prompt decision. He was the last\r\nman in the world to lead an intrigue or command a difficult situation.\r\nPersonally he was amiable, without being attractive, and he had retained\r\na certain boyishness of mind which in his unofficial moments was very\r\napparent. His industry was great and his conduct irreproachable. As a\r\nquite young man this was very noticeable. He always preferred his work,\r\nhowever little interesting, to any form of amusement, and even when on\r\nleave would spend his spare afternoons copying despatches with us in his\r\nfather's chancery rather than be at the trouble of inventing occupation\r\nfor himself elsewhere. I record this because he has been credited in\r\nEgypt with an ambitious and intriguing restlessness which was the\r\nprecise opposite of his very quiet character. Neither in pleasure nor in\r\nwork had he the smallest spirit of adventure. Otherwise it is possible\r\nthat he might have accompanied us, as I proposed to him to do, to\r\nArabia, but he was not one to leave the beaten track, and, though I\r\ninterested him as far as I could in my more romantic plan, he preferred\r\nto follow the common tourist road, and so went on after a few days to\r\nJerusalem.\r\n\r\nOur own journey was a very different one, and proved to be of even more\r\ninterest than I had anticipated. The full detail of it has been\r\npublished both in English and in French, under the title \"A Pilgrimage\r\nto Nejd,\" and so I will deal, with it here briefly. To narrate it in a\r\nvery few words: we travelled by the Haj Road as far as Mezarib and from\r\nthence to the Jebel Hauran, where one of the Druse chiefs of the Atrash\r\nfamily provided us with a _rafyk_ or guide, and so passed down the Wady\r\nSirhán by Kâf to Jôf where Mohammed el Aruk, son of the Sheykh of\r\nTudmor, who was with us, had relations. Thence, after some stay with\r\nthese, we crossed the Nefud, a hazardous passage of ten days through the\r\ngreat sand desert to Haïl and, though we had no letters or introductions\r\nof any kind, were received by the Emir Mohammed Ibn Rashid, the then\r\nsovereign of independent Nejd, with all possible honour. Our quality of\r\nEnglish people was a sufficient passport for us in his eyes, and the\r\nfact of our visits made the previous year to so many of the Anazeh and\r\nShammar Sheykhs, rumours of which had reached him. By this time we had\r\nlearned sufficient Arabic to be able to carry on a conversation, and we\r\nfound him courteous and amiable, and exceedingly interested to hear all\r\nwe had to tell him about the affairs of the great world from which Nejd\r\nis so completely shut off by the surrounding deserts. On matters which\r\nat all concerned Arabia he was curious to learn our opinion, and\r\nespecially as to the characters of the various Bedouin Chiefs, his\r\nenemies or rivals. European politics interested him very little, and\r\nhardly more the politics of Constantinople or Egypt, for at that time\r\nthe Sultan, though Nejd was called at Bagdad a province of the empire,\r\nwas in no way recognized by the Wahhabi Princes as their sovereign, and\r\nthe only relations they had had with him for a century had been those of\r\na hostile character. The recollection of Mohammed Ali's invasion of Nejd\r\nwas still a living memory, and Midhat Pasha's more recent seizure of El\r\nHasa on the Persian Gulf and his abortive expedition to Jôf were much\r\nresented at Haïl. It stood us in good stead with Ibn Rashid that we had\r\ncome to him without the intervention of any Ottoman authority.\r\n\r\nThe result of this friendly visit to the capital of independent Arabia,\r\nwith the view I obtained there of the ancient system of free government\r\nexisting for so many centuries in the heart of that wonderful peninsula,\r\nwas to confirm me in the enthusiastic feelings of love and admiration I\r\nalready entertained for the Arabian race. It was indeed with me a\r\npolitical \"first love,\" a romance which more and more absorbed me, and\r\ndetermined me to do what I could to help them to preserve their precious\r\ngift of independence. Arabia seemed to me in the light of a sacred land,\r\nwhere I had found a mission in life I was bound to fulfil. Nor do I\r\nthink that I exaggerated the value of the traditional virtues I saw\r\npractised there.\r\n\r\nBy nearly all Orientals the Bedouin system of government is looked upon\r\nas little else than brigandage, and on the confines of civilization it\r\nhas, in fact, a tendency to degenerate into such. But in the heart of\r\nArabia itself it is not so. In Nejd alone of all the countries of the\r\nworld I have visited, either East or West, the three great blessings of\r\nwhich we in Europe make our boast, though we do not in truth possess\r\nthem, are a living reality: \"Liberty, Equality, Brotherhood,\" names only\r\neven in France, where they are written up on every wall, but here\r\npractically enjoyed by every free man. Here was a community living as\r\nour idealists have dreamed, without taxes, without police, without\r\nconscription, without compulsion of any kind, whose only law was public\r\nopinion, and whose only order a principle of honour. Here, too, was a\r\npeople poor yet contented, and, according to their few wants, living in\r\nabundance, who to all questions I asked of them (and in how many lands\r\nhad I not put the same in vain) had answered me invariably, \"Thank God,\r\nwe are not as the other nations are. Here we have our own government.\r\nHere we are satisfied.\" It was this that filled me with astonishment and\r\npleasure, and that worked my conversion from being an idle onlooker at\r\nthe misfortunes of the Eastern world into one filled with zeal for the\r\nextension of those same blessings of liberty to the other nations held\r\nin bondage. Our journey back to the civilized but less happy world of\r\nIrak and Southern Persia, which we visited in turn in the following\r\nspring, only confirmed and intensified my conviction. How wretched a\r\ncontrast indeed to Nejd were the lands of the Lower Euphrates, inhabited\r\nby the same Arab race, but a race demoralized, impoverished, and\r\nbrutalized by Ottoman rule! How still more wretched Persian Arabistan! I\r\ncast about in my mind for some means of restoring them to their lost\r\ndignity, their lost prosperity and self-respect, and, for a moment, I\r\nsaw in England's protection, if it could be given, a possible road for\r\nthem to salvation. It was with ideas of this sort taking shape and\r\nsubstance in my mind that, after a most difficult land journey from\r\nBagdad to Bushire on the Persian Gulf and thence by sea to Kurrachi, I\r\nfound myself at last in India, where experiences of another kind were\r\nawaiting me and a new lesson in the economy of Eastern things.\r\n\r\nMy reason for going on to India, after the severe journey we had just\r\nmade, was that on our arrival at Bushire we had found letters awaiting\r\nus from Lord Lytton, who had for many years been my most intimate\r\nfriend, inviting us to pay him a visit at Simla. Lytton, of whose\r\nendearing personal qualities I need here say nothing, for I have already\r\npaid that tribute to his beloved memory, had been like myself in the\r\ndiplomatic service, and I had served with him at Lisbon in 1865, and we\r\nhad written poetry and lived together in an intimacy which had been\r\nsince continued. Now in 1879 he had been a little over two years Viceroy\r\nin India, and at the time we arrived at Simla was just bringing his\r\nfirst Afghan campaign to a successful conclusion, and he signed the\r\nTreaty of Gandamak in the first month of our staying with him. Lytton,\r\nwho was a man of very superstitious temperament, though a rationalist in\r\nhis religious beliefs, spent much of his spare time during the war, hard\r\nworker though he was, in making fire-balloons which he launched at\r\nintervals, arguing from their quick or slow ascensions good or bad\r\nfortune to his army. Not that he allowed such results to decide his\r\naction, for he was a steady worker and sound reasoner, but it soothed\r\nhis nerves, which were always highly strung, to have these little\r\nintimations of a supernatural kind in which he persuaded himself half to\r\nbelieve. He connected my coming to Simla with the good turn the war had\r\ntaken, and looked upon me as a fortunate influence as long as I was with\r\nhim. He made me the confidant of all his thoughts, and from him I\r\nlearned many interesting things in the region of high politics which I\r\nneed not here particularize, though some of them will be found embodied\r\nin this memoir. With my Arabian ideas, as a man of romance and a poet,\r\nhe at once professed his sympathy, and gave instructions to Sir Alfred\r\nLyall, who was then his Foreign Secretary, to talk the matter over with\r\nme and give me all possible information.\r\n\r\nThe Indian Government was at that time not at all disinclined to make a\r\nforward movement in the Persian Gulf. There had been for many years past\r\na kind of protectorate exercised by the Indian Navy of the Arabian\r\nseaports, a protectorate which, being rigidly restricted to the\r\nprevention of piracy and quarrels between the tribes at sea without any\r\nattempt at interfering with them on shore, had been wholly beneficent,\r\nand the recent assertion of the Ottoman claim to sovereignty over them\r\nwas resented at Calcutta. The Sultan Abdul Hamid too had already begun\r\nto alarm our authorities by his Pan-Islamic propaganda, which it was\r\nthought was affecting the loyalty of the Indian Mohammedans. Ideas,\r\ntherefore, of Arab independence were agreeable to the official view, and\r\nSir Alfred Lyall reported well of mine to Lytton, so well that there was\r\na plan half agreed to between us that I should return the following\r\nwinter to Nejd and should be the bearer of a complimentary message from\r\nthe Viceroy to Ibn Rashid. I am glad now, with my better knowledge of\r\nthe ways of the Indian Government, that this proposal led to no\r\npractical result. I see plainly that it would have placed me in a false\r\nposition, and that with the best will in the world to help the Arabs and\r\nserve the cause of freedom I might have made myself unconsciously the\r\ninstrument of a policy tending to their subjugation. It is one of the\r\nevils of the English Imperial system that it cannot meddle anywhere\r\namong free people, even with quite innocent intentions, without in the\r\nend doing evil. There are too many selfish interests always at work not\r\nto turn the best beginnings into ill endings.\r\n\r\nThese matters, however, were not the only ones I discussed with Lytton\r\nand his subordinates. Sir John Strachey, his finance minister, put me\r\nthrough a course of instruction on Indian finance and Indian economics,\r\nthe methods of dealing with famines, the land revenue, the currency, the\r\nsalt tax, and the other large questions then under discussion--Strachey\r\nbeing the chief official advocate of what was called the forward policy\r\nin public expenditure--and with the unexpected result that my faith, up\r\nto that moment strong in the honesty of the Indian Government, as the\r\nfaithful guardian of native interests, was rudely shaken. The following\r\nextracts from letters written by me at the time from Simla will show how\r\nthis short glimpse of India at headquarters was affecting me: \"I am\r\ndisappointed,\" I wrote, \"with India, which seems just as ill-governed as\r\nthe rest of Asia, only with good intentions instead of bad ones or none\r\nat all. There is just the same heavy taxation, government by foreign\r\nofficials, and waste of money one sees in Turkey, only, let us hope, the\r\nofficials are fools instead of knaves. The result is the same, and I\r\ndon't see much difference between making the starving Hindoos pay for a\r\ncathedral at Calcutta and taxing Bulgarians for a palace on the\r\nBosphorus. Want eats up these great Empires in their centralized\r\ngovernments, and the only way to make them prosper would be to split\r\nthem up and let the pieces govern themselves.\" Also to another friend,\r\nHarry Brand, Radical Member of Parliament, now Lord Hampden, \"The\r\n_natives_, as they call them, are a race of slaves, frightened, unhappy,\r\nand terribly thin. Though a good Conservative and a member of the\r\nCarlton Club I own to being shocked at the Egyptian bondage in which\r\nthey are held, and my faith in British institutions and the blessings of\r\nBritish rule have received a severe blow. I have been studying the\r\nmysteries of Indian finance under the 'best masters,' Government\r\nsecretaries, commissioners, and the rest, and have come to the\r\nconclusion that if we go on _developing_ the country at the present rate\r\nthe inhabitants will have, sooner or later, to resort to cannibalism,\r\nfor there will be nothing but each other left to eat. I do not clearly\r\nunderstand why we English take their money from these starving Hindoos\r\nto make railroads for them which they don't want, and turnpike roads\r\nand jails and lunatic asylums and memorial buildings to Sir Bartle\r\nFrere, and why we insist upon their feeding out of their wretched\r\nhandfulls of rice immense armies of policemen and magistrates and\r\nengineers. They want none of these things, and they want their rice very\r\nbadly, as anybody can see by looking at their ribs. As to the debt they\r\nhave been saddled with, I think it would be honester to repudiate it, at\r\nleast as a Debt on _India_. I never could see the moral obligation\r\ngovernments acknowledge of taxing people for the debts they, and not the\r\npeople, have incurred. All public debts, even in a self-governing\r\ncountry, are more or less dishonest, but in a foreign despotism like\r\nIndia they are a mere swindle.\"\r\n\r\nOn the whole, this brief visit to India at headquarters had considerable\r\ninfluence with me in the shaping of my ideas on the larger questions of\r\nImperial policy, and giving them the direction they afterwards took. I\r\nstill believed, but with failing faith, in the good intentions, if no\r\nlonger in the good results, of our Eastern rule, and I thought it could\r\nbe improved and that the people at home would insist upon its being\r\nimproved if they only knew.\r\n\r\nOne of my last recollections of my two months' stay with Lytton at\r\nPeterhoff, as the Viceregal residence was then called at Simla, was of a\r\ndinner at which I sat next to Cavagnari the evening before he set out on\r\nhis fatal mission to Kabul. He was an interesting man, the grandson, so\r\nhe told me, of a Venetian merchant who, when the French Republican army\r\noccupied Venice, lent a large sum of money to Bonaparte, which was never\r\nrepaid. The Emperor, however, rewarded him by making his son his private\r\nsecretary, who became a devoted adherent of the Imperial family. Lewis\r\nNapoleon Cavagnari, the grandson, was also a strong Bonapartist, and\r\nbelieved himself, on account of his name, to have before him a very high\r\ndestiny. He had faith in his \"star,\" and I can testify that in his talk\r\nto me that night--and it was long and intimate--the last thing he seemed\r\nto think of was failure or danger in his mission. Yet only a few days\r\nbefore he must have had an admonition in the tragic news, of which we\r\nalso talked, of the Prince Imperial's death in South Africa. When we\r\nparted it was with an engagement on my part and on my wife's that we\r\nwould go in the autumn to visit him at Kabul. \"You must not come,\r\nhowever,\" he said, \"before the autumn, because I shall not have got the\r\nResidency comfortable or fit to receive ladies.\" Of any more dangerous\r\nreason he gave us no kind of hint.\r\n\r\nAnother acquaintance at that time with whom a tragic history is\r\nconnected was Colley, then Lytton's military secretary, who the year\r\nfollowing was to die on Majuba Hill. Lytton had the highest possible\r\nopinion of his military talents, and between them they had in large\r\nmeasure directed the Afghan campaign from Simla. His fault was, I think,\r\ntoo great self-confidence and too much ambition. He occupied Majuba\r\nbecause he could not bear to let the campaign end without gaining some\r\npersonal success. Melgund again, who is now Lord Minto, Pole-Carew, and\r\nBrabazon, Lytton's aides-de-camp, were all three, with Lord Ralph Kerr,\r\namong our friends of that time, and Plowden and Batten, the husbands of\r\ntheir two fair wives. We made the voyage back from Bombay in Melgund's\r\ncompany and that of Major Jack Napier, leaving India on the 12th of July\r\nin full monsoon and arriving at Suez on the 25th, and on the same day by\r\ntrain to Alexandria.\r\n\r\nI think it was at Aden, as we passed it to the Red Sea, that we learned\r\nthe great news of the day in Egypt, the deposition of the Khedive\r\nIsmaïl, a subject to us of great rejoicing, and no sooner had we arrived\r\nat Alexandria than I learned the full details of his share in the affair\r\nfrom that other intimate friend of my diplomatic days, Frank Lascelles,\r\nwhom I found acting Consul-General at the British Agency. What he told\r\nme does not differ much from the account of it officially published, and\r\nI need not repeat it here. What, however, is not generally known is the\r\npart played in it by the Rothschilds, which Lascelles did not at that\r\ntime know but which I heard later from Wilson. Wilson, indeed, was able\r\nto boast that through these he had had his full revenge. On his return,\r\nhe told me, from Egypt, crestfallen and abandoned by his own Government,\r\nhe had gone straight to the Rothschilds at Paris and had represented to\r\nthem the danger their money was running from the turn affairs had taken\r\nat Cairo and Alexandria. The Khedive intended to repudiate his whole\r\ndebt and to shelter himself in doing so by proclaiming Constitutional\r\ngovernment in Egypt. If they did not prevent this, all would be lost. He\r\nthus succeeded in alarming the Rothschilds and in getting them to use\r\nthe immense political influence they possessed in favour of active\r\nintervention. At first, however, they had pulled the strings both at\r\nDowning Street and on the Quai d'Orsay in vain. The English Government\r\nwas no longer in an intervening mood, trouble having broken out for them\r\nin South Africa; and at Paris, too, there was an equal unwillingness. In\r\ndespair for their millions the Rothschilds then made supplication at\r\nBerlin to Bismarck, who ever since his Frankfort days had extended a\r\ncertain contemptuous protection to the great Hebrew house, and not in\r\nvain. The French and English Governments were given to understand by the\r\nthen all-powerful Chancellor that if they were unable to intervene\r\neffectively in Egypt in the bond-holders' interests the German\r\nGovernment would make their cause its own. This settled the matter, and\r\nit was agreed that, as the least violent form of intervention, the\r\nSultan should be applied to to depose his too recalcitrant vassal. To\r\nthe last moment Ismaïl refused to believe that the Porte, on which he\r\nhad lavished so many millions and was still appealing cash in hand--for\r\nhe had hidden treasures--would desert him. The pressure from Europe was\r\ntoo great. Wilson claims to have had the question of Ismaïl's successor\r\nsubmitted to him as between Halim, whom the Sultan much preferred, and\r\nTewfik, and to have decided in favor of the latter as being known to him\r\nto be of weak character and so the more convenient political instrument.\r\nBut be that as it may, the fatal telegram was despatched conveying to\r\nIsmaïl the news of his fall, and that his Viceregal functions had passed\r\naway from him to his son. It had been Lascelles' disagreeable duty to\r\nconvey the news to the old tyrant of eighteen irresponsible and ruinous\r\nyears. True to his rapacious habit, his last act had been to deplete the\r\ntreasury of its current account and to gather together all the valuables\r\nhe could anywhere lay hands on, and so retire to his yacht, the\r\n\"Mahroussa,\" with a final spoil of his Egyptian subjects amounting, it\r\nis said, to three millions sterling. Nobody had cared to hinder him or\r\ninquire, or bid him stay even for an hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nENGLISH POLITICS IN 1880\r\n\r\n\r\nCavagnari's tragical death at Kabul, which took place before the summer\r\nof 1879 was over, a disaster which involved Lytton in a new war and\r\nendless political trouble, effectually ended any projects we had made of\r\nfresh travel for that year, either in Afghanistan or Arabia. I spent,\r\ntherefore, a full twelve months in England, the busiest as yet in some\r\nways of my life. Up to that date, though I was now in my fortieth year,\r\nI had not only taken no public part in politics, but I had never so much\r\nas made a speech to an audience or written an article for a review, or a\r\nletter to a newspaper. Constitutionally shy in early life I had shrunk\r\nfrom publicity in any shape, and the diplomatic training I had had had\r\nonly aggravated my repugnance to being _en évidence_. Diplomacy, whether\r\nit has or has not anything to hide, always affects secrecy and\r\nentertains a distrust of public speaking and an extreme jealousy of the\r\nindiscretions of the Press. Now, however, having persuaded myself that I\r\nhad a mission in the Oriental world, however vague and ill defined, I\r\nbegan to talk and write, and even overcame my timidity to the extent of\r\nappearing once or twice upon a platform. The first occasion on which I\r\never thus spoke was at a meeting of the British Association at Sheffield\r\non the 22nd of August, to which I was invited as a distinguished\r\ntraveller in the company of M. Serpa Pinto, M. de Brazza, and Captain\r\nCameron, all of African fame, and where I opposed Cameron's advocacy of\r\na Euphrates Valley Railroad. I was able to speak on this matter with\r\nmore authority than he, for, though he had gone out with much beating of\r\ndrums the year before to explore the route, he had turned back from the\r\ndifficult part of it--that which lay between Bagdad and Bushire--while\r\nwe had made the whole route from sea to sea; and I followed up my\r\nopposition in an article on the same subject, the first I ever wrote,\r\nin the \"Fortnightly Review.\" John Morley was at that time editor of the\r\n\"Fortnightly,\" and I had an introduction to him from Lytton, and managed\r\nto interest him in my Eastern ideas. Both these little ventures with\r\nspeech and pen brought me credit and encouraged me to do more in the\r\ndirection of what was now my propaganda. I was busy too with poetry;\r\nand, again, I had my wife's book of travels, \"A Pilgrimage to Nejd,\" to\r\narrange and edit. The multiplied work occupied me fully all the winter.\r\n\r\nWith home politics I troubled myself not at all, though it was a time of\r\ncrisis, and Gladstone, with the General Election of 1880 at hand, was in\r\nthe full fervour of his Midlothian preaching. My sympathies, as far as\r\nEngland was concerned, were still rather with the Tories, and on\r\nOriental questions I looked upon Gladstone, little as I loved the Turks,\r\nas an ignoramus and fanatic. My personal friends, with the exception of\r\ntwo or three, Harry Brand and Eddy Hamilton, were all Tories, and my\r\nlove for Lytton covered in my eyes the worst of Disraeli's Imperial\r\nsins. I clung to the thought that England in the East might yet, through\r\nthe Cyprus Convention properly interpreted, be made an instrument for\r\ngood, and I was swayed backwards and forwards in regard to her Imperial\r\nposition by opposing hopes and fears. It was not till I had cleared my\r\nthoughts by putting them into print that I gradually came to any\r\nsettled plan. One great pre-occupation, too, I had that year in the\r\nestablishment of my stud of Arab horses at Crabbet, about which I was in\r\nconstant correspondence with the world of sport, including a public one\r\nwith the Jockey Club. Curiously enough, it was in connection with my\r\nviews on horseflesh that I first came into epistolary communication with\r\nMr. Gladstone. His well-known hobby about ancient Greece had made him\r\ncurious to learn my opinion about the horses of antiquity, and\r\nespecially the probable breeding of those of Greece and Troy; and a\r\nmessage was conveyed to me through Mr. Knowles, the editor of the\r\n\"Nineteenth Century Review,\" asking a memorandum on their genealogy.\r\nThis, and the accident of his naming Edward Hamilton, with whom I was\r\nintimate, his private secretary when he took office in April in\r\nsuccession to Disraeli, were the links which led to our correspondence\r\nlater on Egyptian affairs.\r\n\r\nA few extracts from a fragmentary journal I began to keep in 1880 will\r\nshow the chaos of ideas, literary, social, and political in which during\r\nthat year, I lived. The extracts are only such as have some relation to\r\nEastern affairs, and I find them embedded in a mass of notes recording\r\nevents of private and ephemeral interest no longer of any value. The\r\nfirst gives a picture of Lord Stratford de Redcliffe, for so many years\r\nour Ambassador at Constantinople, and who was now living in retirement\r\nand extreme old age with his two daughters on the borders of Kent and\r\nSussex:\r\n\r\n\"_March, 1880._--A visit to Lord Stratford de Redcliffe at Frant. Lord\r\nStratford has given me a paper on reforms for Turkey, which he is\r\nthinking of sending to the 'Times,' and I read it in bed. It is an old\r\nman's work, rambling and vague, with hardly an occasional touch of\r\nvigour. Old men should write nothing but their recollections, and Lord\r\nS. is ninety-four. A wonderful old man, nevertheless, with a countenance\r\nof extreme benignity, a complexion of milk and rose leaves, clear blue\r\neyes, and hair as white as snow. Though rather deaf, he still talks\r\nwell. I wrote him in return a memorandum with my ideas for Asiatic\r\nTurkey, and later spent the morning with him listening to his old-world\r\nrecollections. He was _Chargé d'Affaires_ at Constantinople when Byron\r\npassed through on his Childe Harold journey, and had ridden with him\r\nevery day for six weeks. Byron had been very agreeable, and there was\r\nnothing at that time _scabreux_ in his conversation. He had also (before\r\nthat) in 1805 met him at Lord's Cricket Ground at the Eton and Harrow\r\nmatch, both of them playing in the elevens on opposite sides. Byron\r\nplayed cricket 'as well as could be expected considering his infirmity.'\r\nHe, Lord S., had never been willing to think there had ever been\r\nanything really wrong between B. and Lady Caroline Lamb. The impression\r\nLord S. gives me is one of extreme kindness, gentleness, and benignity,\r\nquite foreign to his reputation. I had rather sit listening to these\r\nold-world confessions than to the talk of the prettiest woman in\r\nLondon.\"\r\n\r\n\"_March 16._--Breakfasted with Rivers Wilson and discussed Colonel\r\nGordon's character. All the world is agreed about his being a very\r\nwonderful man. He has ruled the Soudan for four years single-handed, and\r\nhas repressed the slave trade completely. Now he comes home to England\r\nand nothing is done for him. Neither Lord Beaconsfield nor any of the\r\nMinisters will so much as see him. He made a mistake at starting (in his\r\nrelations with them). Passing through Paris (on his way home) he called\r\non Lord Lyons (at the Embassy), and begged him to see to the appointment\r\nof a European successor to himself in the Soudan, and in the course of\r\nconversation held out the threat that, if the English Government would\r\nnot do this, he would go to the French Government. Whereupon a\r\ncorrespondence ensued with Lord Lyons, in which Gordon wrote a last very\r\nintemperate letter ending in these words: 'I have one comfort in\r\nthinking that in ten or fifteen years' time it will matter little to\r\neither of us. A black box, six feet six by three feet wide, will then\r\ncontain all that is left of Ambassador, or Cabinet Minister, or of your\r\nhumble and obedient servant.' This has stamped him (in official eyes) as\r\na madman. Now he has left Europe, shaking the dust off his feet, for\r\nZanzibar.\"\r\n\r\nThis little anecdote is very characteristic of Gordon and is in harmony\r\nwith much of his correspondence, four years later, with Sir Evelyn\r\nBaring. Our officials always detested him, for he habitually violated\r\nthe rules of their diplomacy and the conventions of their official\r\nintercourse. Some thought him mad, others that he drank, and others\r\nagain that he was a religious fanatic who, when he was in doubt between\r\ntwo courses, consulted his Bible for an oracle, or as a last solution\r\n\"spun a coin.\" Not one of them understood or trusted him. At the moment\r\nof which I am writing, the early spring of 1880, he was very angry with\r\nthe English Government for the part it had taken in deposing Ismaïl.\r\nGordon for some reason or other liked Ismaïl, and hated his successor\r\nTewfik, and as soon as he learned at Khartoum what had happened, he had\r\nthrown up his Governorship, and was now especially angry because a\r\nTurkish pasha, and not a European, had been appointed in his place.\r\nGordon was a man of genius, with many noble qualities, but he was also a\r\nbundle of contradictions, and the officials were probably right when\r\nthey looked upon him as not being at all times quite of a sound mind.\r\nThis, as will be seen, was the official opinion even at the very moment\r\nof his being charged at the Foreign Office with his last mission to\r\nKhartoum.\r\n\r\nThe following, too, of the same date, 16th March, is interesting:\r\n\"Called on Cardinal Manning. Our conversation was on politics. He asked\r\nme which way I should vote at the Elections. I said, 'I should vote only\r\non one consideration, a £5 note,' _Cardinal_: 'You mean you will not\r\nvote at all?' _I_: 'I can get up no interest in these things. I look\r\nupon European civilization as doomed to perish, and all politics as an\r\nexpedient which cannot materially delay or hasten the end.' _Cardinal_:\r\n'I take the same view, though probably on different grounds. Europe is\r\nrejecting Christianity, and with it the reign of moral law. The reign of\r\nforce is now beginning again, as in the earliest ages, and bloodshed and\r\nruin must be the result. Perhaps on the ruins the Church may again build\r\nup something new.' Talking of Asia, he said that Ralph Kerr had told him\r\nthat the inhabitants of India attributed the mildness of our rule to\r\nfear. They respect the Russians because they govern by military law.\r\n_I_: 'The Russians are Asiatics. They govern in the Asiatic way--by\r\nfraud if possible--if not, by force. This Asiatics understand.'\r\n_Cardinal_: 'The Russians, as you say, are Asiatics; and I will tell you\r\nmore: their Nihilists are Buddhists. Nihilism is a product not of the\r\nWest, but of the East.'\"\r\n\r\nThe General Elections, it must be remembered, of 1880 were fought to a\r\nvery large extent on questions of Eastern policy. Gladstone in his\r\nMidlothian campaign had attacked with tremendous violence the whole of\r\nDisraeli's scheme of imperial expansion, and had denounced as grossly\r\nimmoral his intervention at Constantinople and Berlin in favour of the\r\nTurks, his acquisition of Cyprus, his purchase of the Suez Canal shares,\r\nand his aggression on Egypt--as also Lytton's two Afghan campaigns and\r\nthe Boer War still raging in South Africa. With regard to Egypt,\r\nGladstone had as long before as the year 1877 made known his views in\r\nprint, and in an article in the August number of the \"Nineteenth Century\r\nReview\" of that year, \"Aggression on Egypt and Freedom in the East,\" had\r\ndeclared himself in the clearest and strongest terms opposed to the\r\nundertaking by England of any form of responsibility on the Nile. This\r\narticle is so remarkable and so wonderfully prescient of evils he was\r\nhimself destined to inflict upon Egypt that it deserves quoting. He\r\nobjects in it to such aggression on various grounds: first, as\r\nincreasing England's burden of Eastern rule, already too great;\r\nsecondly, because extensions of imperial rule can only be effected by\r\nimmoral means; thirdly, as regarded Egypt, that the pretence of\r\nprotecting the route to India by occupying the Nile Valley was a false\r\none, the route by the Cape of Good Hope being England's true line of\r\ncommunication; and, fourthly, because intervention of any kind, whether\r\non the Suez Canal or at Cairo, must inevitably lead to farther and\r\nfarther adventures in Africa. \"Our first site in Egypt,\" he writes, \"be\r\nit by larceny or be it by emption, will be the almost certain egg of a\r\nNorth African Empire that will grow and grow till another Victoria and\r\nanother Albert, titles of the lake sources of the White Nile, will come\r\nwithin our borders, and till we finally join hands across the Equator\r\nwith Natal and Cape Town, to say nothing of the Transvaal and the Orange\r\nRiver on the south or of Abyssinia or Zanzibar to be swallowed by way of\r\n_viaticum_ on our journey--and then, with a great empire in each of the\r\nfour quarters of the world ... we may be territorially content but less\r\nthan ever at our ease.\" He had made also a plea for the continuation of\r\nMohammedan self-government at Cairo. \"The susceptibilities which we\r\nmight offend in Egypt,\" he says, \"are rational and just. For very many\r\ncenturies she has been inhabited by a Mohammedan community. That\r\ncommunity has always been governed by Mohammedan influences and powers.\r\nDuring a portion of the period it had Sultans of its own. Of late, while\r\npolitically attached to Constantinople, it has been practically governed\r\nfrom within, a happy incident in the condition of any country and one\r\nwhich we should be slow to change. The grievances of the people are\r\nindeed great, but there is no proof whatever that they are incurable.\r\nMohammedanism now appears in the light of experience to be radically\r\nincapable of establishing a good or tolerable government over civilized\r\nand Christian races; but what proof have we that in the case of a\r\nMohammedan community, where there are no adverse complications of blood\r\nor religion, or tradition or speech, the ends of political society, as\r\nthey understand them, may not be passably obtained.\" Lastly, he had\r\nforeseen the quarrel which an attempt by England to seize Egypt would\r\ncreate with France: \"My belief is that the day which witnesses our\r\noccupation of Egypt will bid a long farewell to all cordiality of\r\npolitical relations between France and England. There might be no\r\nimmediate quarrel, no exterior manifestation, but a silent, rankling\r\ngrudge there would be like the now extinguished grudge of America during\r\nthe Civil War, which awaited the opportunity of some embarrassment on\r\nour side and on hers of returning peace and leisure from weightier\r\nmatters. Nations have long memories.\" He had ended his article by a\r\nsolemn warning and an appeal to the hand of the Most High to confound\r\nthe intrigues of Cabinets, and secure the great emancipation of the\r\nEast. \"No such deliverance,\" he concludes, \"has for centuries blessed\r\nthe earth. We of this country (England) may feel with grief and pain\r\nthat we have done nothing to promote it. Whatever happens, may nothing\r\nstill worse than this lie at our door. Let us hope ... that to abdicate\r\nduty we may not have to add a chapter of perpetrated wrong.\"\r\n\r\nWith these noble declarations, reiterated in a score of speeches during\r\nthe Election campaign of 1880, I could not but be in sympathy, had it\r\nbeen possible to take them as quite sincere or as representing a policy\r\nintended by the Liberal Party to be carried out when they should be in\r\noffice. But Gladstone did not at that time inspire me with any\r\nconfidence, and between Whigs and Tories there seemed to me to be but\r\nlittle difference.\r\n\r\n\"_March 20._--John Pollen (then private secretary to Lord Ripon) dined\r\nwith us. We talked of the Elections and agreed there was not much to\r\nchoose between Whigs and Tories. I shall not vote. Though Lord\r\nSalisbury's policy is less contemptible than Lord Granville's or\r\nGladstone's, it is coquetting too much with the Germans to please me. To\r\nbring Germany down to Constantinople would be a greater misfortune than\r\nanything Russia can accomplish.\"\r\n\r\n\"_April 6._--Paris (the Elections being over and having resulted in a\r\nlarge Liberal majority). Godfrey Webb and I breakfasted with Bitters (my\r\ncousin Francis Gore Currie), and I then went to the Embassy. Sheffield\r\n(Lord Lyon's private secretary) very important about the new Liberal\r\nGovernment--what he said to Hartington, and what Granville said to him.\r\nThough I abstain from politics, I confess I think the Gladstonian\r\ntriumph a great misfortune. They are so strong now that we shall have\r\nall sorts of experiments played with our British Constitution. The game\r\nlaws, the land laws, and all the _palladiums_ will be dismantled. Our\r\npolicy in Asia will suffer. The Whigs know nothing of the East and will\r\nbe afraid to reverse the Tory policy, and afraid to carry it logically\r\nout. They will try to reform Turkey, and, finding it impossible, will\r\nlose their temper and very likely drift into a war. Personally the\r\nchange is annoying to me, as now Lytton will resign with the Ministry\r\nand we shall be baulked of our Indian visit next winter. But all these\r\nthings are trifles in the march of history.\"\r\n\r\n\"_April 9._--(Still at Paris.) A letter from Anne full of politics....\r\n'Hartington is to be Premier, Goschen Admiralty, and Gladstone finance\r\n... nothing in the foreign policy will be changed! Cyprus kept, Russia\r\nthwarted, and Turkey administered from Gallipoli.... Lord Ripon does not\r\nknow his _own_ place, if any. I hear Mme. de Novikoff[5] still described\r\nas the Egeria of Gladstone.'... Dined with Adams (first secretary of the\r\nParis Embassy) and met there Rivers Wilson, who goes to-morrow to Egypt\r\nwith Dicey, and Arthur Sullivan the composer--all pleasant company.\"\r\n(This was Wilson's final mission in which he arranged the law of\r\nliquidation.)\r\n\r\n\"_April 26._--Home to England, where Gladstone is the talk of the hour.\r\nHe has taken office (as Prime Minister) and has surrounded himself with\r\nineptitudes, Childers, Bright, Granville! Hartington, who is a good\r\nsecond-rate man, takes the India Office and Ripon goes to India. This\r\nlast arrangement is a secret.\"\r\n\r\nLord Ripon's appointment to India as Viceroy was the only quite sincere\r\nattempt made in foreign policy by Gladstone to carry out in office what\r\nhe had preached when in opposition. Ripon was a thoroughly honest man,\r\nof no very brilliant parts but straightforward and in earnest. He took\r\nseriously the mission with which he was entrusted by the new Government\r\nof making and keeping the peace on the Indian frontiers, and of\r\ninaugurating a new policy having for its object to carry out the Queen's\r\nproclamation of self-government among the natives. To the astonishment,\r\nand indeed scandal, of the official world, he took with him as his\r\nprivate secretary Gordon, whom all looked upon as mad--than which no\r\nbetter proof could have been given of his _bona fides_ towards Native\r\nIndia. Gordon, however, was not of the stuff of which private\r\nsecretaries, even with a chief like Ripon, are made, and he had hardly\r\nlanded at Bombay before he resigned. I do not think that Ripon was in\r\nfault in this, but rather Gordon's restless chafing against all rules\r\nand conventions. I shall have later to describe Ripon's viceroyalty when\r\nI come to my second Indian journey in 1884. Now it will be enough to say\r\nthat, if it achieved comparatively little, it was through the\r\npusillanimity of the Ministry at home rather than his own. He valiantly\r\nwent on in the course traced out for him at the start, but like boys who\r\nsometimes in a race, to make a fool of their companion who is in front\r\nof them, hang back and stop, he found out to his confusion after a while\r\nthat he had been running alone and that the Ministers who had changed\r\ntheir minds without letting him know had long been laughing at him for\r\nhis persistence. It must have been a bitter moment for him when he, too,\r\nhad to give in. The other appointments made were all, as far as\r\nthe highest offices went, given by Gladstone to the Whigs. Lord\r\nGranville--the matter which interested me most--got the Foreign Office,\r\nan amiable old nobleman with a good knowledge of French, but very deaf\r\nand very idle, whose diplomacy was of the old procrastinating school of\r\nnever doing today what could possibly be put off till to-morrow, or, as\r\nhe himself was fond of putting it, of \"dawdling matters out\" and leaving\r\nthem to right themselves alone. Of such a Minister nothing in the way of\r\na new policy could be expected, and none was attempted either in Turkey,\r\nor Egypt, or elsewhere. The Cyprus Convention was neither repudiated nor\r\nturned to account for any good purpose, and beyond a little sham\r\npressure put upon the Sultan in the matter of Montenegro and the Greek\r\nfrontier, things were left precisely as they were. The only change made\r\nwas that Layard, the author of the Convention, was recalled from\r\nConstantinople and Goschen appointed in his place, the same Goschen who\r\nhad made the leonine arrangement for the bondholders in Egypt three\r\nyears before, his own family firm of Göschen and Frühling being one of\r\nthem. The only act of the new Foreign Secretary which showed that he\r\nremembered Mr. Gladstone's denunciations of the Turks was that, in order\r\nto prove that Gladstone had been right and Disraeli and Salisbury wrong\r\nabout them, he in defiance of the ordinary rule in such matters at the\r\nForeign Office published a secret despatch of Layard's which\r\ncontradicted everything the Ambassador had written about the situation\r\nat Constantinople in his public despatches. In this unfortunate document\r\nhe had laid bare the secret vices and weaknesses of the Sultan Abdul\r\nHamid, his personal cowardice especially being insisted on and\r\nemphasized with details then unknown to the world, but now notorious, of\r\nhis system of spy-government. Its publication was a gross act of\r\ntreachery to Layard, and was, moreover, an act of folly from the effects\r\nof which our diplomacy at Constantinople has not yet recovered; Layard\r\nhad been, so to say, Abdul Hamid's bosom friend and had received from\r\nhim favours of a kind not usually accorded to European Envoys. The\r\nSultan had shown himself to Layard as to a comrade on whom he could\r\nrely, and the disclosure of what he considered Layard's treachery\r\nalienated for ever his goodwill from England.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, and notwithstanding the unpromising position at the\r\nForeign Office, I was resolved in the interests of my propaganda to make\r\na bid for sympathy for my plans with the new Prime Minister. I was\r\nencouraged to this by the appointment he had made on taking office of\r\none of my most intimate friends, Eddy Hamilton (now Sir Edward Hamilton,\r\nK.C.B.), to be his private secretary, from whom I learned that, whatever\r\nmight be the public exigencies of the moment abroad, Mr. Gladstone's\r\nsympathies with Oriental liberty were no whit abated. From Hamilton I\r\nhad no secrets as to my own views and plans, and all that he thought\r\nnecessary to win his master to them was that I should give them a wider\r\npublicity in print. There were other channels, too, through which it was\r\njudged that Gladstone might be influenced, and some of these are\r\nreferred to in my journal.\r\n\r\n\"_June 12._--Hamilton Aidé took me to call upon Mrs. L, who lives in a\r\nbig house in M ... Square, a plump, good-natured Irishwoman of fifty,\r\nimpulsive, talkative, but without trace either of beauty or anything\r\nelse. She is one of Gladstone's _Egerias_, and our visit was partly\r\ndiplomatic, as I want to indoctrinate her with my Arabian ideas, and\r\nthrough her the Prime Minister. She is already enthusiastic about such\r\nArabs as she has seen, and affects a serious interest in the East. She\r\nread us with much spirit a drama she had been writing about Herod,\r\nCleopatra, and Julius Caesar--sad stuff, which she assured us Gladstone\r\nadmired exceedingly.\r\n\r\n\"Rolland, John Pollen and Lawrence Oliphant to dinner. The last a very\r\nattractive man. He has just come back from Constantinople, where he has\r\nbeen trying to get a concession from the Sultan for lands beyond Jordan\r\nto be colonized by the children of Israel.\"\r\n\r\n\"_June 22._--The Plowdens to dinner and Eddy Hamilton, who is now\r\nGladstone's private secretary. Plowden goes to Bagdad to-morrow as\r\nResident. I indoctrinated him and Eddy on the Eastern question.\"\r\n\r\n\"_June 26._--Lord Calthorpe, Percy Wyndham, and Captain Levitt joined us\r\nat Crabbet, and we had a show of horses. Lord C. tells me he has shown\r\nmy letter about Arab horse-racing to several members of the Jockey Club,\r\nand he will bring the matter forward at one of the club meetings next\r\nmonth; so that it is to be hoped we shall succeed. If I can introduce a\r\npure Arabian breed of horses into England and help to see Arabia free of\r\nthe Turks, I shall not have quite lived in vain. My fourth letter to the\r\n'Spectator' (on the politics of Central Arabia) has appeared to-day, and\r\nmy article in the 'Fortnightly' ('The Sultan's Heirs in Asia') is\r\nadvertised.... Later to the Admiralty, where Lord Northbrook\r\ncomplimented me on my letters (they were the first I had ever written to\r\na newspaper). Sir Garnet Wolseley was there, a brisk little jerky man,\r\nwhom it is difficult to accept as a great general. I reminded him of our\r\nvisit to Cyprus. He said, 'I believe Lady Anne is writing a book.' 'Yes,\r\nbut we have said nothing about Cyprus in it.' 'Oh, you didn't stay long\r\nenough.' 'We thought it best to say nothing.'\"\r\n\r\nThe article here spoken of, \"The Sultan's Heirs in Asia,\" was, as I have\r\nsaid, a bid for Gladstone's serious attention to my ideas, and through\r\nHamilton's help, who brought it under his notice, it was completely\r\nsuccessful, though characteristically the feature of it which interested\r\nhim most was that which has proved least politically practical, and was\r\nto me the least important, namely, the future of the Armenian provinces\r\nas an independent state. The idea I propounded was, that in the same way\r\nas a large portion of European Turkey had been given its independence,\r\nso in the decline of the Ottoman Empire the Asiatic provinces should\r\nalso be encouraged to form themselves into independent states, according\r\nto their prevailing nationalities; and I appealed by name to Mr.\r\nGladstone to make good his words, so freely and so recently uttered in\r\nfavour of Eastern liberty, by making use of the instrument devised by\r\nhis predecessors in office, the Cyprus Convention, not for the selfish\r\npurposes of English imperialism, but for the good of the peoples of the\r\nEast. Its publication in the July number of the \"Fortnightly\" led to my\r\nbeing invited to Downing Street, where I had an opportunity of pressing\r\nmy views personally on the Prime Minister. It will be seen that I was\r\nnot on that first occasion much impressed by him; but I was encouraged\r\nto develop my ideas, and from that time my opinion, conveyed to him\r\ngenerally through Hamilton, was of some account with Gladstone in regard\r\nto Eastern affairs.\r\n\r\n\"_June 27._--Called on A. with whom I found Queensberry. He began at\r\nonce to expound to us his religious doctrines, talking in an excited,\r\nearnest way. These doctrines seem to me mere Comtism. There is some sort\r\nof Supreme Being, not a personal God, and a conscience by which man is\r\nguided in his search of perfection. The principle doctrine, 'faith in\r\nhumanity,' and the principal duty, 'the perfectioning of body and soul,'\r\nespecially body. The Marquess is not a very lucid expounder, and\r\nproposed to recite us a poem instead--a poem he had written. While we\r\nwere expecting this in came Philip Currie and a little old man with a\r\nlong nose and very black eyes, Malkum Khan, the Persian Ambassador.\r\nThese sat down and listened while Queensberry recited. The poem was in\r\nblank verse, vague, doctrinal, fantastic, beginning with the Matterhorn\r\nand going on to Humanity. When he had finished the Oriental spoke. He\r\nsaid, 'Perhaps it would interest you to hear the story of a religion\r\nwhich was founded some years ago in Persia, and of which I was at one\r\ntime the head. It will exemplify the manner in which religions are\r\nproduced, and you will see that the doctrine of Humanity is one at least\r\nas congenial to Asia as to Europe. Europe, indeed, is incapable of\r\ninventing a real religion, one which shall take possession of the souls\r\nof men; as incapable as Asia is of inventing a system of politics. The\r\nmind of Asia is speculative, of Europe practical. In Persia we every day\r\nproduce \"new Christs.\" We have \"Sons of God\" in every village, martyrs\r\nfor their faith in every town. I have myself seen hundreds of Babis\r\nsuffer death and torture for their belief in a prophet whose doctrines\r\nwere identical with those of Jesus Christ, and who, like Him, was\r\ncrucified. Christianity is but one of these hundred Asiatic preachings,\r\nbrought into notice through its adoption by the Greek mind and given a\r\nlogical form and a material complexion. If it had remained an Asiatic\r\nfaith it would long ago have perished, as a hundred moral and mystic\r\nteachings have perished before and after it. When I was a young man I,\r\ntoo, as I told you, founded a religion which at one time numbered 30,000\r\ndevotees. I was born an Armenian Christian, but I was brought up among\r\nMohammedans, and my tone of thought is theirs. I was foster-brother to\r\nthe Shah and when he came to the throne he made me his Prime Minister.\r\nAt the age of twenty I was practically despotic in Persia. I saw the\r\nabuses of government, the decline of material prosperity in the country,\r\nand I was bitten with the idea of reform. I went to Europe and studied\r\nthere the religious, social, and political systems of the West. I\r\nlearned the spirit of the various sects of Christendom, and the\r\norganization of the secret societies and freemasonries, and I conceived\r\na plan which should incorporate the political wisdom of Europe with the\r\nreligious wisdom of Asia. I knew that it was useless to attempt a\r\nremodelling of Persia in European forms, and I was determined to clothe\r\nmy material reformation in a garb which my people would understand, the\r\ngarb of religion. I therefore, on my return, called together the chief\r\npersons of Teheran, my friends, and spoke to them in private of the\r\nneed which Islam had of purer doctrine. I appealed to their moral\r\ndignity and pride of birth. There are in Persian two words, each\r\nsignifying Man--_insan_, from the Arabic, and _adhem_ (Adam), more\r\nstrictly Persian in derivation. The second signifies Man as a genus, a\r\nparticular kind of animal--the first man as an intellectual and\r\ndistinguished being (the _homo_ and _vir_ of Latin). You all, I said,\r\npride yourselves that you are more than _adhem_; you are also _insan_.\r\nAnd it is to enable you to justify that pretension that I will advise\r\nyou to do this and that. They all found my reasoning good, and in a\r\nshort time I had got together 30,000 followers. Under the name of a\r\nReformation of Islam I thus introduced what material reforms I could.\r\nTo my doctrine is due the telegraph, the reorganization of the\r\nadministrative departments, and many another attempted improvement since\r\ngone to ruin. I had, however, no intention at the outset of founding a\r\nreligion. The character of saint and prophet was forced on me by my\r\nfollowers. They gave me the title of \"Holy Ghost,\" and the Shah that of\r\n\"Reformer of Islam.\" I wrote a book, a bible of my creed, and\r\nenthusiasts maintained that I worked miracles. At last the Shah was\r\nalarmed at my power, which in truth had become superior to his own. He\r\nsought, in spite of our old friendship, to kill me, and my followers\r\nsought to kill him. For two months we both lived in great fear of\r\nassassination, and then we came to an explanation. I loved and revered\r\nthe Shah, and I asked permission to travel. My followers took leave\r\nof me with tears, even the Mollahs kissing my feet. I went to\r\nConstantinople, thinking to get permission from the Sultan to reside at\r\nBagdad, and I in fact went there and gained new converts from among the\r\nresident Persian and Bagdad Shiahs. But the Turks deceived me, and I had\r\nto leave my work unfinished. My followers in Persia urged me to return,\r\nbut I was deterred through several motives; first, I feared to find my\r\ndeath for a religion in which I did not believe, secondly, my health\r\nbroke down, and, thirdly, I had married a wife. I wrote to the Shah, who\r\nreplied, offering me any appointment I would, so I would remain abroad;\r\nand I accepted the position of Ambassador-General to all the Courts of\r\nEurope.' It was strange to hear this little old man, in European clothes\r\nand talking very good French, recounting a tale so purely Oriental. I\r\nwalked home with him afterwards (he lived on the other side of Hyde\r\nPark), and he detailed to me his ideas about the East and West, both of\r\nwhich he knows, and knows thoroughly. I left him with the impression\r\nthat he was the most remarkable man I had ever met, and more convinced\r\nthan ever of the superior intelligence of the Eastern mind. Who is there\r\nin Europe that could have made one thus feel like a child?\"\r\n\r\nThis chance meeting, at a fine lady's house in Belgravia in the middle\r\nof the London season, affected me profoundly, and to a certain extent\r\nrevolutionized my ideas. I trace to it, and to other talks which I had\r\nlater with this singular personage, the conviction which rapidly\r\novercame me that in all my thought of freeing and reforming the East I\r\nhad begun at the wrong end, and that, if I was to effect anything either\r\nfor the Arabs or for any other of the Moslem peoples subject to the\r\nTurks, I must first make myself thoroughly acquainted with their\r\nreligious ideas. As yet I had passed among them, in spite of my\r\npolitical sympathy, as a stranger to their more serious thought; without\r\nreligious prejudice myself of the ordinary Christian kind, I had learned\r\nto respect Islam, but I did not comprehend it, nor had I ever discussed\r\nits teachings with any one learned in its law or conversant with its\r\nmodern thought. I saw at once the weakness, nay the absurdity of my\r\nposition, and I resolved before I went any farther to devote the\r\nfollowing winter to a study of at least the main features of the\r\nMohammedan doctrines as they affected Mohammedan politics. With this\r\nview I made my plans for the winter. My thought was to go to Jeddah at\r\nor about the time of the pilgrimage, and there inform myself as I best\r\ncould, and then take any occasion that might offer for further action. I\r\nwished to penetrate once more into Arabia, if possible through Hejaz, or\r\nperhaps Yemen to Nejd. I had an idea that among the Wahhabis I might\r\nfind a teacher who would give me the Arabian as opposed to the Ottoman\r\nview of Islam, and that I might devise with him a movement of reform in\r\nwhich I should suggest the political, he the religious elements. It was\r\na sufficiently wild idea, but I entertained it seriously at the time,\r\nand the confession of having done so will explain to Egyptian readers\r\nhow it came about that I took the line I did at Cairo a year later.\r\n\r\nI was influenced, too, at that time in London by another learned\r\nOriental, one Sabunji, whose acquaintance I had made in the character of\r\nArabic teacher. He, too, like Malkum Khan, was of Christian origin, a\r\nmember of one of the Catholic sects of Syria, and he had even taken\r\npriest's orders and served the Congregation of the Propaganda at Rome;\r\nbut he had latterly thrown off the cassock and, like the Ambassador, was\r\nmuch more in sympathy with Islam than with his own faith. As an Arabic\r\nscholar he was very remarkable, and he had a wide acquaintance with the\r\nquestions, half political, half religious, which were being discussed\r\njust then among Mohammedans. He had done the main work for the late Dr.\r\nBadger in compiling the Arabic-English Dictionary which goes by Dr.\r\nBadger's name, and in 1880 was carrying on in London an Arabic newspaper\r\ncalled \"El Nakhleh,\" the Bee, in which religious reform was preached to\r\nMohammedans once a month, on the most advanced lines of modern thought.\r\nThere was a mystery about the financing of this little journal, and the\r\nmotives prompting its issue, which I never quite fathomed. His own\r\naccount of it was that his chief patron was the Sultan of Zanzibar, a\r\nvery enlightened and liberal-minded ruler. But I was never quite\r\nsatisfied with this explanation, and I have since had reason to believe\r\nthat the funds to support it, and the suggestion of its politics came,\r\nin part at least, from the ex-Khedive Ismaïl. Ismaïl was at that time\r\nvery angry with the Sultan for his betrayal of him to Europe, and the\r\n\"Bee\" was violent against Abdul Hamid, and denounced him especially as\r\nan usurper of the title of Emir el Mumenin and Caliph. I do not well\r\nremember whether it was from this Sabunji or from Malkum Khan that I\r\nfirst came to understand the historical aspect of the caliphal question\r\nand its modern aspects, but, opposed as I was to Ottoman rule, it struck\r\nme at once as one of high importance to the kind of reform I was\r\nbeginning now to look for. There is notice in my journal of my having\r\nsent in a memorandum to Mr. Gladstone on the subject, and I have a\r\nletter from Hamilton, showing that the idea was considered one of\r\nimportance by members of the Cabinet and generally in Downing Street.\r\n\r\n\"_July 3._--A tea party at A.'s, a 'collection of mystics,' old Rolland,\r\nDunraven, and Oliphant. The two latter and I had a conference in a back\r\nroom which resulted in our agreeing to act in common on the Eastern\r\nquestion, so as to influence public opinion in England. We are to have a\r\npreliminary meeting at Dunraven's on Thursday.\"\r\n\r\n\"_July 8._--Called on Percy Wyndham and converted him to my political\r\ncreed. Also received a visit on the same subject from Mr. Boyce, M. P.\r\nDined with Dunraven, Oliphant, Otway, Percy Wyndham, Harry Brand, and\r\nWhittaker, editor of the 'Levant Herald,' at Limmer's Hotel, to arrange\r\na course of action with a view to influencing public opinion in England\r\nrespecting Asia. Nothing more definite settled than the formation of a\r\ncommittee for receiving news. Later to Bryce's, where I met one\r\nRobertson Smith, who has been lately in the Hejaz.\" (This was the\r\nwell-known professor.)\r\n\r\n\"_July 13._--Went to a party at Mrs. Gladstone's. We arrived early,\r\nbefore other people had come, and I had twenty minutes' conversation\r\nwith the great man. I detailed to him my ideas about the regeneration of\r\nthe East, in which he seemed to take an interest, as far as a man can\r\nwho is totally ignorant of the A B C of a question. His remarks struck\r\nme as the reverse of profound, and his questions contrasted unfavourably\r\nwith those put to me three years ago by Lord Salisbury. A British\r\nsteamer had been fired on by some Arabs on the Tigris, and he began by\r\nremarking that he feared this fact showed a marked antagonism towards\r\nEngland on the part of Arabia. The state of the Ottoman Empire he\r\nconsidered most _critical_. Probably the East had never been in a more\r\n_critical_ state than now. If the Treaty of San Stefano had been carried\r\nout Turkey could hardly have been more _critically_ situated than she\r\nwas. I succeeded however, I think, in grafting him with two ideas, one\r\nthat the Caliphate was not necessarily vested in the House of Othman,\r\nthe other that Midhat Pasha was a fool. He has evidently made up his\r\nmind about nothing, and will let himself drift on till the smash comes.\"\r\n\r\n\"_July 15._--Attended a meeting of Philo-Asiatics. In the afternoon to\r\nAldermaston, a fine park with a tiresome modern house; Sir Henry Layard\r\ndoing the honours. I had a great prejudice against him, but find him\r\nagreeable and without pretension, considering his position. He talks\r\nwell, especially of his travels, and he really understands the East,\r\nreminding me a little of Skene and Rolland, both fellow travellers of\r\nhis in old days.... Layard's memoirs would be the most interesting of\r\nany man's of the present century. His rise from the position of a\r\nwandering outcast among the Kurds, almost himself an outlaw, to that of\r\nBritish Ambassador to the Porte, contains all the romance of human\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\n\"_July 17._--An interview with Sir Charles Dilke (Under-Secretary of\r\nState) at the Foreign Office. I explained to him my idea of going to\r\nNejd this autumn with Abdallah Ibn Saoud, and to my surprise he seemed\r\nto acquiesce. Although our conversation was not a long one, it left me\r\nwith the impression of Dilke being a superior man. His questions were\r\nplain and to the point, and, once understood, he wrote the draft of a\r\ndespatch to Goschen at Constantinople, referring me for further details\r\nto Tenterden (the permanent Head of the Foreign Office), and I am now\r\nfull of the notion of going to Arabia and heading a movement for the\r\nrestoration of the Arabian Caliphate. People have been called great who\r\nhave sacrificed themselves for smaller objects, but in this I feel the\r\nsatisfaction of knowing it to be a really worthy cause.\"\r\n\r\nSir Charles Dilke, who was destined to play a considerable part in the\r\nevents of 1882 in Egypt, had in 1880 been only a few months at the\r\nForeign Office. He and Chamberlain, who were great political friends,\r\nrepresented with Bright the Radical element in the new government.\r\nChamberlain got the Local Government Board and a seat in the Cabinet,\r\nand Dilke the Foreign Under-Secretaryship, which, with his chief, Lord\r\nGranville, in the House of Lords and an idle man besides, was a position\r\nof great power Dilke knew how to take advantage of. Neither of the two\r\nmen belonged to the class from which Ministers in England are usually\r\nchosen, but were looked upon as middle-class men, and I remember the\r\ndisgust with which Dilke's appointment was received at the Foreign\r\nOffice, where aristocratic pretensions are traditional among the clerks.\r\nDilke, however, soon showed his mettle by the way he took his work\r\nin hand, and, what was even more to the purpose with them, by\r\ncertain Gallicisms in conversation which were also a Foreign Office\r\ncharacteristic, so that in a very few weeks he found himself not only\r\ntolerated but popular. The Abdallah Ibn Saoud referred to in my journal\r\nwas a certain Abdallah Ibn Theneyyàn Ibn Saoud, of the old princely\r\nfamily of Nejd, who had found his way to Constantinople, and had there\r\napplied to the British Embassy for help to gain or regain a political\r\nposition in his own country. I had heard of him from Currie, and had\r\njumped to the conclusion that this might be the opportunity I sought in\r\nArabia, and so applied to the Foreign Office to put me in communication\r\nwith him and favour my projected journey. The plan, however, came to\r\nnothing, though, as has been seen, not altogether disapproved at the\r\nForeign Office, for when the matter was referred to Lord Tenterden, the\r\npermanent Under-Secretary, he demurred, on the ground that the thing if\r\nundertaken with the cognizance of the Foreign Office would be liable to\r\nbe regarded as a \"secret mission,\" and such missions were contrary to\r\nthe traditions of the Office. And so the plan was abandoned. Just at\r\nthis time, too, the news of the disgraceful defeat of the British army\r\nunder Burrows at Candahar by the Afghans reached London, and I fancy\r\nmade them doubly cautious in Downing Street. The defeat was a final blow\r\nto Lytton, and to the policy of adventure beyond the Indian frontier he\r\nhad made his own, and at no time within recollection did the imperial\r\nfortunes of England seem so low. All the world was depressed by it, even\r\nI, little of a Jingo as I had become.\r\n\r\n\"_August 5._--To Portsmouth by train, having got a telegram to say the\r\nLyttons are expected to-night or to-morrow. Portsmouth is a strange,\r\nold-fashioned town, still without a decent inn; and we are at a\r\npot-house called the 'Star and Garter.' In the house opposite there is a\r\nbust of Nelson, and from the windows one can see the 'St. Vincent' and\r\nthe 'Victory.' Little as one may care for one's country--and Heaven\r\nknows I am no Chauvin--it is impossible not to be touched by these\r\nrelics of England's greatness. I never till this moment quite realized\r\nthe decay of her fortunes since sixty years ago. What a shock it would\r\nbe for Nelson and his companions if he could read the papers to-day,\r\nfull of dastardly congratulations at the discovery that not 2,000 but\r\nonly 1,000 men were lost on the Helmund, and at General Burrows not\r\nhaving positively run away; of fears lest England should embark\r\nsingle-handed on a war with Turkey, and an abject hope that France may\r\nthink fit to see us through our difficulties in the East--all this, with\r\nLytton's arrival at Portsmouth, Lytton who, if things go wrong with\r\nIndia, will leave a name in history as the first of the unsuccessful\r\nViceroys of the British Empress and the one most responsible for India's\r\nloss. All this, I say, gives one a feeling of sorrow impossible to\r\ndescribe. Yet I do not join with those who cry out on Lytton's policy,\r\nstill less on its execution. His policy was a necessary one, and its\r\nexecution has been bold and successful. He has been conspicuous in the\r\nhistory of England's decay only because he is himself conspicuous. He\r\ncould not have stemmed the tide of events. He went with them, guiding as\r\nhe could but powerless to do more. England's decay rests upon causes far\r\nmore general than any one man or party of men can be responsible for. We\r\nfail because we are no longer honest, no longer just, no longer\r\ngentlemen. Our Government is a mob, not a body endowed with sense and\r\nsupported by the sense of the nation. It was only by immense industry,\r\nimmense sense, and immense honour that we gained our position in the\r\nworld, and now that these are gone we find our natural level. For a\r\nhundred years we did good in the world; for a hundred we shall have done\r\nevil, and then the world will hear of us no more.\"\r\n\r\n\"_August 6._--After several false alarms the 'Himalaya' was signalled;\r\nand, having fortunately met the rest of the small party of friends come\r\nto greet Lytton, we went out to meet her and were taken on board just\r\nopposite Osborne. At the gangway, brown as a berry and very ill dressed\r\nin clothes of four years ago and a flap-away Indian hat, stood Lytton\r\nwith that cigarette in his mouth which cost him his Viceroyalty. On what\r\ntrifles success depends! If he could have refrained from smoking out of\r\nseason, and if he could have gone to church with his wife, all his sins,\r\nthough they had been like scarlet, would have been forgiven him by the\r\nAnglo-Indian public. As it was, he had this against him throughout his\r\nreign, and it turned the scale when he was politically defeated. But for\r\nthis he would never have been recalled. He himself, conscious of having\r\ndone his best and done well, cares nothing for such things, and he is\r\nright. I could envy him this feeling almost as much as I envy him the\r\ndelight of going home to Knebworth. When we had seen them on shore and\r\ntaken tea with them at the inn, we wished them good-bye. 'Oh, the dear\r\ndrunken people in the streets!' Lady Lytton exclaimed, 'how I love\r\nthem!'\"\r\n\r\n\"_September 7._--Knebworth. In the morning I wrote and read, but in the\r\nafternoon I went down with Lytton to the fishing house and talked over\r\nthe Eastern question, in which I find his views not very divergent from\r\nmy own. We are both agreed that the day of England's _empire_ is fast\r\nending--for my own part I do not care how soon. Lytton has more\r\npatriotism.\"\r\n\r\n\"_October 29._--Crabbet. Spent the day with Lytton ... he read me his\r\ndefence for the House of Lords. He has an immensely strong case, and\r\nshould make one of the most remarkable speeches of the age if he is\r\nallowed to bring forward all the documents in his possession. He showed\r\nme these, the Russian correspondence taken at Kabul and the draft of a\r\nsecret treaty between Shere Ali and the Russians. He also told me that\r\nwhen he was going to India Schouvaloff called on him and proposed to him\r\nto divide Afghanistan between Russia and England.\"\r\n\r\nThis is nearly the last entry in my journal of 1880, which unfortunately\r\nI discontinued till two years later. The full explanation Lytton was\r\nnever allowed to make in Parliament, and his speech, robbed of its\r\nstrongest points, fell comparatively flat when he made it before the\r\nHouse of Lords. I will, however, add an extract from a letter he wrote\r\nme on the 18th of November, which will complete this chapter of my\r\nstory. It is of value as giving a very accurate epitome of the political\r\nsituation of the date: \"I saw,\" Lytton writes, \"in one of the papers the\r\nother day a statement that the new Sherif of Mecca (Abdul Mutalleb), who\r\nis completely a tool of the Sultan, is working actively under orders\r\nfrom Constantinople to put the Mohammedans against us in all parts of\r\nthe world. The cry is now, 'The Caliph in danger.' This was to be\r\nexpected, and I fear the opportunity has passed for the good which might\r\nhave been effected a year ago through the Arabs. The only result of\r\nGladstone's action, so far as I can see, has been to destroy our\r\ninfluence at Constantinople and transfer it to Germany, without\r\nsubstituting for it any other means of controlling the Mohammedan world.\r\nThe Mansion House speech (Gladstone's), expected with so much curiosity,\r\nseemed to me a weak confession of utter failure in the policy of the\r\nGovernment. They drop Greece and Armenia, and everything else, with the\r\nadmission that their fingers are scorched by the burning end of the\r\nstick at which they grasped so wildly nine months ago. And in Ireland\r\nthey are drifting into great difficulties which may even break up the\r\nCabinet. The fact is the policy which the Government wants to carry out\r\nis everywhere rejected by the Nation; and the policy which the Nation\r\nwants carried out the Government naturally shies at, not wishing to\r\nstultify its promises and declarations. So the result is, for the\r\npresent, no policy at all. As for myself I keep silence, _morne et\r\nprofond_, till Parliament meets, though my heart burns within me.\"\r\n\r\nThe last weeks of my stay in England that autumn were, however, less\r\noccupied with politics than with the publication of a volume of poetry,\r\nto which I had been persuaded by Lytton, and the proofs of which I left\r\nto him to correct. This was \"The Sonnets of Proteus,\" which had a\r\nconsiderable success and which has since gone through many editions. It\r\ngave me almost at once a certain rank in the literary world which was\r\nnot altogether without its influence on my subsequent relations with my\r\npolitical friends.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[5] Madame de Novikoff, a very charming woman, who was in the confidence\r\nof the Russian Government, had come to England for the first time a\r\nlittle before this date, her very earliest English visit being paid to\r\nus at Crabbet. She had brought an introduction to us from Madame de\r\nLagrené, a Russian friend of ours living in Paris, and as yet knew no\r\none. She stayed with us a week, but finding me unsympathetic with her\r\nanti-Islamic views, went on and soon after made a political capture of\r\nMr. Gladstone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE REFORM LEADERS AT THE AZHAR\r\n\r\n\r\nI left England that autumn of 1880 on the 3rd of November, in the first\r\nplace for Egypt, and without any more definite further plan than to go\r\non from thence to Jeddah and educate myself in view of possible future\r\nopportunities. My wilder schemes in regard to the Arabs seemed for the\r\nmoment impracticable, and all that I hoped for was to gain sufficient\r\nknowledge of the doctrine and modern tendencies of Islam to put it into\r\nmy power to act should circumstances become more favourable. On leaving\r\nLondon I had arranged with Hamilton that we should correspond during the\r\nwinter, and that I would let him know anything of special interest which\r\nmight occur on my journey and which he might communicate to Mr.\r\nGladstone, who was still, he assured me, though I had not seen him\r\nagain, interested in my ideas. At the Foreign Office I was looked upon,\r\nthough in a friendly way, more as a visionary than as anything seriously\r\nlikely to affect the official view of Eastern policy, even under a\r\nRadical Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nAt Cairo, where I arrived a few days later, I found much change, and\r\nall, as it seemed to me, for the better. The old irresponsible tyranny\r\nof Ismaïl had given place to the comparatively mild _régime_ of the\r\nAnglo-French _Condominium_. The finances had been regularized, and order\r\nput into most of the Administrations. I visited some of the same\r\nvillages I had known in such terrible straits five years before, and\r\nfound that the worst evils affecting their position had been put a stop\r\nto, and, though still poor and highly-taxed, there was no longer that\r\nfeeling of despair among the fellahin which had made them pour out the\r\nhistory of their woes to me when I had first come among them as a\r\nsympathetic stranger. I went to the British Agency, and was delighted to\r\nfind established there as Consul-General my friend Malet, who gave me a\r\nroseate account of the reforms that had been effected or were in\r\nproject, for as yet little had been actually done except financially.\r\nAll was going slowly but steadily on the road of improvement, and the\r\nonly clouds he could see on the horizon were, first, in the Soudan,\r\nwhich was so great a drain upon Egypt's resources, and, secondly, in the\r\nArmy, where there had been latterly symptoms of discontent. He spoke\r\nmuch in praise of the new Khedive, Tewfik, and took me to see him at the\r\nPalace, and I found him, if not very interesting, at least holding the\r\nlanguage of a civilized and liberal-minded Prince. An echo of Malet's\r\noptimism may be recognized in my letters from Egypt of that date, and I\r\nfind the draft of one I wrote to Hamilton of which the following is an\r\nextract:\r\n\r\n\"I find a great change here for the better since five years ago, and,\r\nwhatever may be the shortcomings the late Government may have to answer\r\nfor elsewhere, their policy in Egypt certainly was a success. The\r\ncountry people now look fat and prosperous, and the few I have talked\r\nto, people who in former years complained bitterly of their condition,\r\nnow praise the Khedive and his administration. They seem, for once, to\r\nhave gone the right way to work here, making as few changes as possible\r\nin the _system_ of government and only taking care that the _men_ who\r\ncaused the disorder should be changed. It was a great stroke of policy\r\ngetting rid of Ismaïl, and I feel little doubt that with proper\r\nmanagement the present man will go straight. Egypt is so rich and such a\r\ncheap country to govern that its finances _must_ come right, if it\r\nlimits its ambition to its own natural prosperity. But there are one or\r\ntwo rocks ahead, the government of the Soudan for instance, which will\r\nalways be an expense and will always be an excuse for maintaining an\r\narmy. I cannot conceive why Egypt should charge itself with governing\r\nthe Nile beyond the First Cataract, its old boundary. Putting down the\r\nslave-trade in Africa is an amusement only rich countries need afford\r\nthemselves. It will also be a great misfortune if such protection and\r\nsupervision as the Government gets from England should be withdrawn, at\r\nleast for some years and until a new generation has grown up used to a\r\nbetter order of things than the old. I should like immensely to see\r\nSyria put under another such _régime_. That, too, if there is no\r\nattempt to hold the desert, is a fairly rich country and might be made\r\nto pay its way. But it would require a very distinct protection from\r\nEurope to relieve it of the cost of an army. For police purposes a very\r\nsmall force would be sufficient, and I am convinced that people in\r\nEngland exaggerate immensely the difficulty of keeping the peace between\r\nthe mixed Mohammedan and Christian populations there. These have all\r\nlain groaning together so long under the same tyranny that the edges of\r\ntheir prejudices have got worn down.\"\r\n\r\nWith regard to my plan of seeking Mohammedan instruction, I was from the\r\noutset singularly fortunate. Rogers Bey, a distinguished Eastern scholar\r\nwhom I had known some years before as Consul at Damascus, was now an\r\nofficial of the Finance Office at Cairo, and from him I obtained the\r\nname of a young Alem connected with the Azhar University, Sheykh\r\nMohammed Khalil, who came to me daily to give me lessons in Arabic, and\r\nstayed to talk with me often through the afternoons. It happened,\r\nhowever, that he was far more than a mere professor of the language of\r\nthe Koran. Mohammed Khalil, of all the Mohammedans I have known, was\r\nperhaps the most single-minded and sincere and at the same time the most\r\nenthusiastic Moslem of the larger and purer school of thought such as\r\nthat which was being expounded at that time at Cairo by his great\r\nmaster, Sheykh Mohammed Abdu. I like to think of him as he then was, a\r\nyoung man of about thirty, serious, intelligent, and good, without\r\naffectation, pious and proud of his religion, but without the smallest\r\ntaint of Pharisaism or doctrinal intolerance or of that arrogant reserve\r\nwhich is so common with Mohammedans in dealing with persons not of their\r\nown faith. He was all the contrary to this. From almost the first day of\r\nour intercourse he made it his duty and his pleasure to teach me all he\r\nknew. His school of interpretation was of the very widest kind. He\r\naccepted as true creeds all those that professed the unity of God; and\r\nJudaism and Christianity were to him only imperfect and corrupted forms\r\nof the one true religion of Abraham and Noah. He would hear nothing of\r\nintolerance, nothing of bitterness between believers so near akin. The\r\nintolerance and the bitterness were the evil legacy of ancient wars, and\r\nhe believed the world to be progressing towards a state of social\r\nperfection where arms would be laid down and a universal brotherhood\r\nproclaimed between the nations and the creeds. As he unfolded to me\r\nthese ideas and based them on texts and traditions, declaring them to be\r\nthe true teaching of Islam, it may be imagined how astonished and\r\ndelighted I was--for they were very close to my own--and the more so\r\nwhen he affirmed that they were the views beginning to be held by all\r\nthe more intelligent of the younger generation of students at his own\r\nuniversity, as well as elsewhere in the Mohammedan world. He gave me,\r\ntoo, an account of how this school of enlightened interpretation had\r\nsprung up almost within his own recollection at the Azhar.\r\n\r\nThe true originator of the Liberal religious Reform movement among the\r\nUlema of Cairo was, strangely enough, neither an Arab, nor an Egyptian,\r\nnor an Ottoman, but a certain wild man of genius, Sheykh Jemal-ed-din\r\nAfghani, whose sole experience of the world before he came to Egypt had\r\nbeen that of Central Asia. An Afghan by birth, he had received his\r\nreligious education at Bokhara, and in that remote region, and\r\napparently without coming in contact with any teacher from the more\r\ncivilized centres of Mohammedan thought, he had evolved from his own\r\nstudy and reflection the ideas which are now associated with his name.\r\nHitherto all movements of religious reform in Sunnite Islam had followed\r\nthe lines not of development, but of retrogression. There had been a\r\nvast number of preachers, especially in the last 200 years, who had\r\ntaught that the decay of Islam as a power in the world was due to its\r\nfollowers having forsaken the ancient ways of simplicity and the severe\r\nobservance of the law as understood in the early ages of the faith. On\r\nthe other hand, reformers there had been of a modern type recently, both\r\nin Turkey and Egypt, who had Europeanized the administration for\r\npolitical purposes, but these had introduced their changes as it were by\r\nviolence, through decrees and approvals obtained by force from the\r\nunwilling Ulema, and with no serious attempt to reconcile them with the\r\nlaw of the Koran and the traditions. The political reforms had been\r\nalways imposed from above, not suggested from below, and had generally\r\nbeen condemned by respectable opinion. Jemal-ed-din's originality\r\nconsisted in this, that he sought to convert the religious intellect of\r\nthe countries where he preached to the necessity of reconsidering the\r\nwhole Islamic position, and, instead of clinging to the past, of making\r\nan onward intellectual movement in harmony with modern knowledge. His\r\nintimate acquaintance with the Koran and the traditions enabled him to\r\nshow that, if rightly interpreted and checked the one by the other, the\r\nlaw of Islam was capable of the most liberal developments and that\r\nhardly any beneficial change was in reality opposed to it.\r\n\r\nHaving completed his studies in 1870, and being then thirty-two years\r\nold, he passed through India to Bombay and joined the pilgrimage to\r\nMecca, and, this duty accomplished, he came on to Cairo and afterwards\r\nto Constantinople. He remained on this first visit no more than forty\r\ndays in Egypt, but he had time to make acquaintance with certain of the\r\nAzhar students and to lay the foundations of the teaching he afterwards\r\ndeveloped. At Constantinople his great eloquence and learning soon\r\nasserted itself, and he was given a position in the _Anjuman el Elm_,\r\nwhere he lectured on all subjects, his knowledge being almost universal.\r\nHe had great quickness of intellect and an astonishing memory, so that\r\nit is said of him that he could read a book straight off on any subject\r\nand master the whole contents as inscribed upon his mind forever.\r\nBeginning with grammar and science, his lectures went on to philosophy\r\nand religion. He taught that Sunnite Islam was capable of adapting\r\nitself to all the highest cravings of the human soul and the needs of\r\nmodern life. As an orthodox Sunni, and with the complete knowledge he\r\nhad of the _hawadith_, he was listened to with respect and soon got a\r\nfollowing among the younger students. He inspired courage by his own\r\nboldness, and his critical treatment of the received commentaries, even\r\nthose of El Hánafi, was accepted by them as it would hardly have been\r\nfrom any other. Their consciences he was at pains to free from the\r\nchains in which thought had lain for so many centuries, and to show them\r\nthat the law of Islam was no dead hand but a system fitted for the\r\nchanging human needs of every age, and so itself susceptible of change.\r\nAll this stood in close analogy to what we have seen of the re-awakening\r\nof the Christian intellect during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries\r\nin Europe and its adaption of orthodox doctrines to the scientific\r\ndiscoveries of the day. It is strange, however, that in Western Islam\r\nthe new spirit of criticism should have been initiated as it was, by\r\none whose education had been made in such unprogressive lands as those\r\nof Central Asia, and at a university so far away.\r\n\r\nSheykh Jemal-ed-din's career at Constantinople was a brilliant but a\r\nshort one. He was essentially a free lance, and, like most Afghans, a\r\ndisregarder of persons and of those ceremonial observances which\r\nregulate among the Ottoman dignitaries the personal intercourse of the\r\ngreat with those who attend their levées. Although protected by certain\r\nof the Liberal Statesmen, and notably by Ali and Fuad Pashas, who saw in\r\nhis teaching a support to their unorthodox political reforms against the\r\nold-fashioned Ulema, Jemal-ed-din had managed to give offence to the\r\nhigh religious authorities, and especially by his independent personal\r\nattitude to the Sheykh el Islam, and these soon found in his lectures\r\nmatter for reproof and condemnation. Advantage was taken of certain\r\npassages in his lectures to denounce him to the Government as an atheist\r\nand a perverter of the law, and when the Afghan reformer had replied by\r\na courageous demand to be confronted with his high accusers and heard in\r\na public discussion the official sense of propriety was shocked and\r\nalarmed. The challenge was producing an immense excitement among the\r\nSoftas, the younger of whom were all on Jemal-ed-din's side, and the\r\nquarrel seemed likely to lead to serious trouble. Notice was somewhat\r\nreluctantly given that he had better leave once more for Egypt and the\r\nHoly Places. It was thus under the cloud of religious persecution that\r\nhe returned to Cairo, but not without having sown the seed of inquiry\r\nwhich was to mature some years later at Constantinople in the shape of a\r\ngeneral demand among the Softas for constitutional reform. It was the\r\nreligious part of the movement which was to culminate in the political\r\nrevolution attempted by Midhat Pasha in 1876.\r\n\r\nAt the Azhar, when he returned to Cairo in 1871, Jemal-ed-din's\r\nreputation had of course preceded him, and, though Egypt was then in the\r\ndarkest night of its religious unintelligence, for the moral corruption\r\nof the Government, especially in Ismaïl's reign, had infected all\r\nclasses and had extinguished every tradition of courage and independence\r\namong the Ulema, considerable curiosity was felt about him. The few\r\nfriends he had made on the occasion of his first visit welcomed him, if\r\nnot openly, in secret, and presently the wonderful fire and zeal of his\r\nconversation drew around him, as it had done at Constantinople, a group\r\nof young and enthusiastic followers. The most remarkable of these, his\r\nearliest disciples at the Azhar, were Sheykh Mohammed Abdu, who was to\r\nplay so important a part in public affairs later and who is now Grand\r\nMufti of Egypt, and Sheykh Ibrahim el Aghani the well-known publicist.\r\nTo these he was able to communicate without reserve his stores of varied\r\nknowledge, and to inspire them with his critical spirit and something of\r\nhis courage. Courage indeed was needed in those days for any man at\r\nCairo to speak out. Ismaïl brooked no kind of opposition and wielded\r\npower so absolute in the country that independent speech, almost\r\nindependent whispering, had disappeared from men's mouths. It was only\r\nthe fellahin of the village, already despoiled of all, that dared\r\ncomplain, or those in the city too poor and insignificant to be of any\r\npolitical count. The highest religious authorities, as well as the\r\nhighest officials, had long been silent about injustice and had chosen\r\ntheir part of acquiescence, content so long as they could get their\r\nshare, each one however small, of the general plunder.\r\n\r\nOn this dark state of intellectual and moral things Jemal-ed-din's\r\ncourageous teaching broke like an apparition of strange light, and his\r\nvery courage for awhile secured him a hearing undisturbed by admonition\r\nfrom the Government. Perhaps his quarrel at Constantinople was a\r\npassport to Ismaïl's tolerance, perhaps he deemed this Afghan too\r\ninsignificant a force to call for suppression. Perhaps, like Ali and\r\nFuad Pashas, he thought to turn the new teaching to account in his long\r\nwar with the European Consuls. Be this as it may, Jemal-ed-din was\r\nallowed during the whole of the remaining years of Ismaïl's reign to\r\ncarry on his lectures, and it was only on Tewfik's accession and the\r\nestablishment of the Anglo-French condominium that he was arrested on an\r\nexecutive order, sent untried to Alexandria, and summarily exiled. He\r\nhad, however, already done his work, and at the time of which I am\r\nwriting his principles of Liberal reform upon a theological basis had so\r\nfar prevailed at the Azhar that they had already been adopted by all\r\nthat was intellectual there among the students. The reformer's mantle\r\nhad fallen upon worthy shoulders, shoulders indeed it may be said,\r\nworthier even than his own. My little Arabic instructor, Mohammed\r\nKhalil, was never weary of speaking to me of the virtues and\r\nintellectual qualities of him who was now his spiritual master, Sheykh\r\nMohammed Abdu, the acknowledged leader at the Azhar, in Jemal-ed-din's\r\nsuccession, of the Liberal Party of reform.\r\n\r\nI find a note among my papers that it was on the 28th of January, 1881,\r\nthat I was first taken by my enthusiastic Alem to Mohammed Abdu's little\r\nhouse in the Azhar quarter, a day to be marked by me with an especially\r\nwhite stone, for it began for me a friendship which has lasted now for\r\nnearly a quarter of a century with one of the best and wisest, and most\r\ninteresting of men. When I use these words of him it must not be thought\r\nthat they are light or exaggerated judgment. I base them on a knowledge\r\nof his character gained in a variety of circumstances on very difficult\r\nand trying occasions, first as a religious teacher, next as leader of a\r\nmovement of social reform and as the intellectual head of a political\r\nrevolution; again, as prisoner in the hands of his enemies, as exile in\r\nvarious foreign lands, and for some years under police surveillance at\r\nCairo when his exile had been annulled; lastly, by the strength of his\r\nintellect and his moral character reasserting himself as a power in his\r\nown country, resuming his lectures at the Azhar, placed in the\r\njudicature, named Judge of Appeal, and finally, in these last days,\r\nGrand Mufti at Cairo, the highest religious and judicial position\r\nattainable in Egypt.\r\n\r\nSheykh Mohammed Abdu when I first saw him in 1881 was a man of about\r\nthirty-five, of middle height, dark, active in his gait, of quick\r\nintelligence revealed in singularly penetrating eyes, and with a manner\r\nfrank and cordial and inspiring ready confidence. In dress and\r\nappearance purely Oriental, wearing the white turban and dark kaftan of\r\nthe Azhar Sheykhs and knowing as yet no European language, or, indeed,\r\nother language than his own. With him I discussed, with the help of\r\nMohammed Khalil, who knew a little French and helped on my insufficient\r\nArabic, most of those questions I had already debated with his disciple,\r\nand between them I obtained before leaving Cairo a knowledge really\r\nlarge of the opinions of their liberal school of Moslem thought, their\r\nfears for the present, and their hopes for the future. These I\r\nafterwards embodied in a book published at the end of the year under the\r\ntitle of \"The Future of Islam.\" Sheykh Mohammed Abdu was strong on the\r\npoint that what was needed for the Mohammedan body politic was not\r\nmerely reforms but a true religious reformation. On the question of the\r\nCaliphate he looked at that time, in common with most enlightened\r\nMoslems, to its reconstitution on a more spiritual basis. He explained\r\nto me how a more legitimate exercise of its authority might be made to\r\ngive a new impulse to intellectual progress, and how little those who\r\nfor centuries had held the title had deserved the spiritual headship of\r\nbelievers. The House of Othman for two hundred years had cared almost\r\nnothing for religion, and beyond the right of the sword had no claim any\r\nlonger to allegiance. They were still the most powerful of Mohammedan\r\nprinces and so able to do most for the general advantage, but unless\r\nthey could be induced to take their position seriously a new Emir el\r\nMumenin might legitimately be looked for. Certainly a new political\r\nbasis was urgently required for the spiritual needs of Islam. In all\r\nthis there was a tone of moderation in the expression of his views very\r\nconvincing of their practical wisdom.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the winter I made with my wife our intended visit to\r\nJeddah, where I gathered much information of the kind I sought as to the\r\nopinions of the various sects of Islam. No place accessible to Europeans\r\ncould have been better chosen for the purpose, and I made the\r\nacquaintance of a number of interesting Moslems through the help of one\r\nYusuf Effendi Kudsi, who had a connection with the English Consulate.\r\nAmong them the most remarkable were Sheykh Hassan Johar, a learned and\r\nvery intelligent Somali, Sheykh Abd-el-Rahman Mahmud from Hyderabad in\r\nIndia, Sheykh Meshaat of Mecca, several members of the Bassam family\r\nfrom Aneyzah in Nejd, and a certain Bedouin Sheykh, a highly educated\r\nman, from Southern Morocco. My stay in Jeddah, however, was but a short\r\none, as I fell ill of a malarious fever very prevalent there, and this\r\nprevented any idea I may still have had of penetrating into the\r\ninterior. The moment, too, I found was a most unfavourable one for any\r\nplan of this kind, through the new hostility of the Meccan authorities\r\nto England. Already the Sultan Abdul Hamid had begun to assert himself,\r\na thing for many generations unknown to his Ottoman predecessors, as\r\nspiritual Head of Islam, and in Arabia especially he had become jealous\r\nof his authority, while his quarrel with our Government made him\r\nsuspicious, more than of any other, of English influences. Only a few\r\nmonths before my visit to Jeddah he had made a vigorous assertion of his\r\nauthority at Mecca by the appointment of a new Grand Sherif of strong\r\nreactionary and anti-European views. The former Grand Sherif Huseyn Ibn\r\nAoun had been a man of liberal ideas and known for his friendly\r\nrelations with the English Consulate, and had so incurred his\r\ndispleasure and met a violent death. Whether this was in reality\r\ncontrived by the Sultan, or perhaps his Valy, it is not possible\r\nprecisely to say, but it was certainly believed to have been so when I\r\nwas at Jeddah.\r\n\r\nI learned the particulars of the Sherif Huseyn's death from his agent at\r\nJeddah, Omar Nassif, who most certainly laid it to the Sultan's charge.\r\nAccording to this account, which I have since had confirmed to me from\r\nother quarters of authority, Huseyn had just ridden down from Mecca at\r\nthe close of the pilgrimage, as the custom was, to Jeddah, there to give\r\nhis blessing to the departing pilgrims. He had travelled down by night\r\nand was making his entrance on horseback to the seaport riding in state\r\nwith an escort, partly Arab, partly Ottoman, intending to alight at Omar\r\nNassif's house, when an Afghan pilgrim poorly dressed, came forward from\r\nthe crowd as if to ask alms and stabbed him in the belly. The Sherif,\r\nthough wounded, rode on and died in his agent's house in the course of\r\nthe day, having, as I heard, been unskilfully treated for his wound\r\nwhich need not have been fatal. There were various circumstances which\r\nseemed to differentiate the case from one of fanaticism or common\r\nmurder. The assassin was no Shiah schismatic, as was first supposed, but\r\nan orthodox Sunni, and he used language after his arrest which seemed to\r\nshow that he considered himself commissioned. \"There was an elephant,\"\r\nhe said, when asked the reason for his deed, \"the greatest beast of the\r\nforest, and to him was sent an ant, the least of living creatures, and\r\nthe ant bit him and he died.\" Also there was no open trial made of the\r\nassassin, who was executed within four days of his arrest, while\r\neverything was done to hush up as far as was possible and conceal the\r\naffair.\r\n\r\nHuseyn's successor who was of the rival house of Zeyd, the Sherif Abdul\r\nMutalleb, belonged to the extremest school of Mohammedan reaction. He\r\nwas an aged man, old enough to have been Sherif at the time Mecca was\r\noccupied by the Wahhabis, when he had conformed, at least outwardly, to\r\nthe Wahhabi doctrine. Now, in extreme age, he was reinstated as Prince\r\nin order to further the Pan-Islamic views held at Constantinople. Under\r\nHuseyn it would have been very possible for an Englishman to have\r\ntravelled through the Hejaz without molestation, and both Doughty and\r\nProfessor Robertson Smith had received his aid and protection. Now any\r\nsuch attempt would have been very dangerous, and, in fact, the French\r\ntraveller Hüber lost his life in venturing in that same year. We\r\nconsequently returned to Suez, and later by Ismaïlia into Syria.\r\n\r\nPassing through Egypt I received the following letters from Hamilton in\r\nanswer to two of mine. They are principally interesting as showing how\r\nthe Government's attention to Eastern matters was already being diverted\r\nand distracted by their troubles nearer at home in Ireland. It is a\r\ncurious and melancholy thing to observe how the necessity, as the Whigs\r\nin the Cabinet considered it to be, of putting down nationalism and\r\nliberty in Ireland reacted upon the fine feelings they had expressed so\r\nreadily out of office of sympathy with national freedom in the East.\r\nGladstone, whose inclination no doubt would have been for liberty in\r\nboth directions, had weighed himself in the Cabinet by these Whig\r\nMinisters, his colleagues, who were all along bent on leading him in the\r\nopposite direction. Ireland throughout the history of the next two years\r\nproved the stumbling-block of his policy, and, as I will show in its\r\nplace, the decision of coercion there was decided on in 1882 at the\r\nself-same Cabinet Council with the decision to coerce in Egypt. The\r\nconnection of misfortune between the two countries was a fatality not a\r\nlittle tragical, both to the countries themselves and doubly so to\r\nEnglish honour.\r\n\r\n     \"10, Downing Street, _Decr. 22, 1880_.\r\n\r\n     \"... I took the liberty of showing your letter to several who I\r\n     knew would like to read it, including Lord Granville, Rivers\r\n     Wilson, Pembroke, and Harry Brand. I think it especially pleased\r\n     Rivers Wilson, who looks with a very tender eye on his work in\r\n     Egypt, and who was naturally gratified to hear from an independent\r\n     source that what he had so prominent a hand in had resulted in so\r\n     much good. I am afraid he considers that his own contribution to\r\n     the result has not been fully appreciated.\r\n\r\n     \"Ireland has continued to monopolize all the time and energies of\r\n     the Government, and I am afraid it is difficult to exaggerate the\r\n     grave state of affairs in that distracted country. Thank goodness,\r\n     we are now within hail of the re-assembling of Parliament. Whether\r\n     or no the Government has erred on the side of over-patience and\r\n     excessive forbearance remains to be proved, and it is not for me to\r\n     venture to express an opinion. The present state of things is\r\n     certainly a disgrace to this country; and the Government are driven\r\n     reluctantly to hark back on the old stereotyped course of strong\r\n     coercive measures. I am beginning, most unwillingly, to think that\r\n     Ireland is not fitted for a Constitutional Government, and that,\r\n     however much we may try to remove legitimate grievances, she will\r\n     not be got into hand again without a return to something like a\r\n     Cromwellian policy. It is heart-breaking work all round, and unless\r\n     some extraordinary transformation can be effected, we shall\r\n     probably have to submit in this country to any amount of shipwrecks\r\n     of governments within the next few years. I feel very gloomy as to\r\n     the look out. Would that we could apply to Ireland a regeneration\r\n     such as you have found in Egypt.... That wretched Ireland has\r\n     nearly knocked the Government out of time as regards foreign\r\n     policy. They will, however, still manage, I hope, to find a corner\r\n     of room for Greece, and not let that question entirely slide, which\r\n     would inevitably mean war between Turkey and Greece. Greece could\r\n     never contend single-handed with Turkey successfully, and Turkey at\r\n     war would probably be the signal for a general revolt in Eastern\r\n     Roumelia and Macedonia. I still trust some sort of compromise on\r\n     the question of adjusting the territory of the kingdom of the\r\n     Hellenes may be effected by the intervention of the Powers in the\r\n     direction of a small slice northwards, and perhaps the handing over\r\n     of Crete. There is no doubt that a means of strengthening and\r\n     opening out Greece must be found, not only to keep the peace\r\n     temporarily in the East, but to lay the foundations for some power\r\n     that may grow into a set-off against the Slavic nationalities....\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"10, Downing Street, _Feby. 11, 1881_.\r\n\r\n     \"Your letter has since its receipt made a little ministerial round.\r\n     I read parts of it to Mr. Gladstone; and Lord Granville and Mr.\r\n     Goschen have both had the benefit of perusing it themselves, and of\r\n     perusing it, as I am told, with interest. Lord Granville, moreover,\r\n     sent a copy of your postscript, which related to Indian matters, to\r\n     Lord Hartington. I hope in having turned your information to\r\n     official account I shall not be considered to have abused your\r\n     confidence. I have shown it also to Harry Brand. His father, the\r\n     Speaker, has had difficulties to encounter such as no predecessor\r\n     in the Chair ever had before; and he has come out of the ordeal\r\n     magnificently. What with unprecedented continuous sitting of the\r\n     House for days and nights and wholesale suspensions of obstructive\r\n     Members, we have been having most exciting Parliamentary times. I\r\n     trust, however, that the neck of obstruction as of the Irish\r\n     land-agitation has been fairly well broken; and when once the\r\n     Coercive, or rather Protective, measures have been passed, and a\r\n     fair, just and strong and comprehensive Land Bill has become law,\r\n     we shall not be troubled again immediately with the Irish\r\n     nightmare.\r\n\r\n     \"Meanwhile of course all public attention has for the last few\r\n     months been centred on that wretched God-forsaken country, and the\r\n     public have not troubled their heads much with foreign affairs.\r\n     However, the Greek question has not been forgotten. Lord Granville\r\n     has been pulling the strings most diplomatically, and not, I hope,\r\n     without success. Of course the great stumbling-block of making head\r\n     with this difficult question has been the very shabby part which\r\n     France has played, first blowing so hot and then blowing so cold.\r\n     However, Bismarck has been induced to take the initiative in making\r\n     a new proposal which may possibly lead to good results. The primary\r\n     condition of all the Powers is of course to maintain the peace of\r\n     Europe. If it were not that the outbreak of war between Turkey and\r\n     Greece would almost inevitably lead to the outbreak of disturbances\r\n     and fighting in Bulgaria and Eastern Roumelia, and if it were not\r\n     that Greece's chances single-handed in a combat would be very\r\n     small, the natural preliminary to Greece raising herself in the\r\n     European scale would be by an appeal to the sword. The modern\r\n     Romans would not have had a united kingdom but for fighting for\r\n     it, and the modern Greeks could hardly complain were they obliged\r\n     to face similar difficulties and dangers. But apart from the\r\n     dangers of a stand-up fight, Greece, having been made the special\r\n     protégé of Europe, has a right not to be thrown overboard now. If\r\n     the Berlin award cannot be enforced peacefully--and owing to\r\n     France's action this seems to be admitted--I believe the massacre\r\n     of the award has been termed in diplomatic phraseology, 'Le\r\n     Barthélemy de St. Hilaire'--the best alternative seems to be to\r\n     find some equivalent for Greece--I mean by compensating her\r\n     elsewhere for what she does not obtain, Thessaly and Epirus, which\r\n     she would accept and which the Powers would in concert help her to\r\n     obtain. Such a proposal as this may possibly be the new departure.\r\n     I am afraid your remedies, though far more effective, are too\r\n     drastic for acceptance by Europe.\"\r\n\r\nI do not remember what in my letters can have suggested this long\r\ndigression about Greece, which did not particularly interest me at the\r\ntime. The phraseology of the letter is so like Mr. Gladstone's own that\r\nI half think this and the previous letter must have been more or less\r\ndictated by him. For this reason I quote them almost _in extenso_, and\r\nbecause the long account of the difficulties of his Greek policy\r\nsuggested to me the idea that perhaps he might, if there was a rising on\r\nthe Greek frontier, also encourage one concurrently with it of the Arabs\r\nin Syria.\r\n\r\nOur journey from Ismaïlia was an interesting one. Once across the Suez\r\nCanal we struck due eastwards, over a long track of sand dunes, to a\r\nvery little known hill region called the Jebel Hellal. This, on a small\r\nscale, has some of the characteristics of Nejd, in vegetation and in the\r\narrangement of its sand drifts, and we made friendly acquaintance there\r\nwith the Aiaideh, the Teyyaha, and, further north, with the Terrabin\r\ntribes, as well as with those very Azazimeh with whom we had been so\r\nnearly having an encounter five years before. All these tribes were at\r\nthat time independent of the Ottoman Government, living as they did in\r\nthe no man's land which forms the frontier between Syria and Egypt. They\r\nhad, however, as is always the case in independent Arabia, been at feud\r\nwith each other and, with debts of blood on either side, the war had\r\ngone on and on, causing much disturbance even to the confines of Gaza.\r\nThe Ottoman Government, to put an end to the trouble, had resorted to\r\none of their common devices. They had invited the chiefs of the two\r\nprincipal tribes to a friendly conference with the Muteserif of Gaza,\r\nand had had them treacherously surrounded and captured, and were now\r\nholding them as hostages for the peace of the frontier in prison at\r\nJerusalem. At that time the long tradition of English influence in\r\nTurkey was still alive among the Arabs, and as we passed through the\r\ntribes the relations of the imprisoned sheykhs besought my intervention\r\nwith the Government to obtain their release. In pity for them I\r\nconsented to do what I could, and I took with me the acting Sheykh of\r\nthe Teyyaha, Ali Ibn Atiyeh, and the little son of the Sheykh of the\r\nTerrabin, who rode on with us to Jerusalem, making our way over the\r\nhills by no road so that we arrived at El Kuds, or rather at Bethlehem,\r\nwithout having entered a single town or village on all our journey. At\r\nJerusalem I called at once upon our Consul, Moore, and obtained through\r\nhim from the Pasha an order to visit the prisons, and found there the\r\nsheykhs I was in search of in an underground dungeon near the Mosque of\r\nOmar. They were in a pitiable condition, suffering from disease and long\r\nconfinement, and I made an application to the governor on their behalf\r\nfor an amnesty for them on condition that a general peace should be\r\nagreed to between the tribes, an agreement which I had got them to sign\r\nand seal. The Muteserif, however, declared himself incompetent to order\r\ntheir release, and referred me to his superior, the Valy of Damascus, as\r\nbeing in a position to do so; and to Damascus we therefore went, still\r\naccompanied by Ali Ibn Atiyeh and with our camel caravan, by way of the\r\nJordan valley and the Hauran plain, a beautiful and interesting journey,\r\nfor the whole country, there having been heavy rain, was a garden of\r\nEden with flowers. In the Hauran we found war going on between the\r\nOttoman troops and the Druses, but managed to slip by between the two\r\narmies without molestation and so arrived at Damascus, where we alighted\r\nat a little house in the Bab Touma quarter which I had purchased, with\r\nan acre of garden behind it, on our visit of three years before when we\r\nwere starting for Nejd.\r\n\r\nOur house at Damascus was next door to that of the well-known\r\nEnglishwoman Lady Ellenborough, or, as she was now called, Mrs. Digby,\r\nwho, after many curious adventures in the East and West, had married in\r\nher old age a Bedouin sheykh of one of the Anazeh tribe, and was living\r\nwith her husband, Mijwel, at Damascus, being no longer able to bear the\r\nhardships of her former desert life. From her and from her excellent\r\nhusband, whom we knew well, we received the advice that we should put\r\nour case for the release of the prisoners neither before the Consul nor\r\ndirectly before the Valy, but indirectly through the intermediary of\r\ntheir distinguished friend and our acquaintance of 1878, Seyyid\r\nAbd-el-Kader, whose influence at Damascus was more powerful on all\r\nthings relating to the Arabs than any other with the Government.\r\nAbd-el-Kader was then a very old man, and was leading a life of\r\nreligious retirement and held in great reverence by all in the city, and\r\namongst the Arabs in Syria especially, he had a large following, for he\r\nhad often proved their protector. Mijwel assured me that it would be\r\nmerely a matter of money with the Valy and that if the Seyyid would\r\nundertake the negotiation with a sufficient sum in hand it could be\r\neasily managed. I consequently called with him and Ali Ibn Atiyeh on\r\nAbd-el-Kader, whom we found with his eldest son Mohammed, a very worthy\r\nman, born to him while he was still in Algeria of an Algerian mother,\r\nand explained our errand, and the Seyyid gladly consented to be our\r\nintercessor with the Pasha, and if possible to arrange for the release\r\nof the Teyyaha and Terrabin sheykhs on the condition prescribed of a\r\ngeneral peace between the tribes, and I left with him a bag containing\r\n400 Napoleons in gold, which he considered would be a sufficient sum to\r\nobtain what we required. Bribery was so much a matter of course in\r\ndealing with Ottoman officials in those days that I do not think either\r\nthe Seyyid or I or any of us had a scruple about offering the money. The\r\nsum was a large one, but my sympathy was strong with the imprisoned\r\nBedouins, and I had it at heart to be able to send Ali Ibn Atiyeh back\r\nto Jerusalem with an order of release for them. So I made the sacrifice.\r\nAs it turned out, however, the negotiation failed of the effect\r\nintended. A few days later the bag was brought back to me by Mohammed\r\nIbn Abd-el-Kader untouched, with a message from his father that the Valy\r\nsent me his compliments and would have been very pleased to be agreeable\r\nto me in the matter but it was beyond his competence; it had already\r\nbeen referred to Constantinople, and it was there alone that the thing\r\ncould be arranged.\r\n\r\nThe sequel of this little incident is curious, and has a direct bearing\r\non events the following year in Egypt. Finding my local efforts vain, I\r\ntook the Valy's advice and wrote to Goschen, our Ambassador at\r\nConstantinople, and laid the case before him, urging as a reason for his\r\ninteresting himself in it, that possibly some day our Government might\r\nhave need of securing the passage of the Suez Canal from possible attack\r\non the eastern side should England happen to be at war with any other\r\npower. Goschen, if I remember rightly, took some steps in the matter,\r\nand when a few weeks later Lord Dufferin succeeded him at the embassy it\r\nwas handed on to him, and eventually, after long waiting, what I had\r\nasked was granted, and the sheykhs were set free. My suggestion,\r\nhowever, about the tribes was to bear fruit later of a kind I did not at\r\nall contemplate or intend, for when in the summer of 1882, the military\r\nexpedition under Wolseley was decided on, it was remembered by Goschen,\r\nor some one else connected with the Government, and, using my name with\r\nthe Bedouins, a secret agent was sent precisely to the tribes I had\r\nbefriended south of the Gaza to draw them into alliance with the English\r\nforces against the Egyptian Nationalist army. I was therefore, as they\r\nsay, unworthily \"hoist with my own petard.\" This was the famous Palmer\r\nmission, about which I shall have more to say in its place.\r\n\r\nSyria and all the Arab frontier was at this time in a great state of\r\npolitical ferment. There were two currents of feeling there among\r\nMohammedans, the one of fanaticism fostered by the Sultan, the other in\r\nfavour of liberal reform, representing the two sides of the Pan-Islamic\r\nmovement, and at Damascus it was represented to me that the feeling\r\nagainst the Sultan and the corrupt Ottoman administration was so strong\r\nthat a general revolt might at any time occur. I spoke to Mohammed Ibn\r\nAbd-el-Kader about it, and found that he and his father were strongly on\r\nthe liberal side and that, like the rest of the Arabic speaking Ulema,\r\nthey favoured the idea of an Arabian Caliphate, if such could be made to\r\ncome about; and the thought occurred to me that no one then living had a\r\nbetter title to be candidate for the Ottoman succession than\r\nAbd-el-Kader himself might have. I therefore begged Mohammed to sound\r\nthe old Seyyid on the subject, and to ask him whether he would be\r\nwilling, should such a movement come to a head, to be put forward as its\r\nleader. Mohammed did so, and brought back a message from his father to\r\nthe effect that, though too old to take any active part in a movement of\r\nthe kind himself, his sons would be willing, and he would not refuse to\r\ngive his name as a candidate for the Caliphate, should such candidature\r\nbe thrust upon him. There would, however, be no chance of success to the\r\nmovement unless it should have support from without, the Ottoman\r\nGovernment being militarily too strong, and it was arranged that I\r\nshould communicate his answer confidentially to our Government and\r\nascertain what attitude England would assume in case of a Syrian rising.\r\nThis therefore I did, using my usual channel of communication with Mr.\r\nGladstone, his private secretary Hamilton, asking what help the Arabian\r\nmovement might count on. I suggested, in reference to Hamilton's letter\r\nalready quoted, that such a movement might be favourably regarded by our\r\nGovernment, especially in connection with their difficulties with the\r\nPorte about Greece. Gladstone's interest, however, in the East and in\r\nforeign politics had by this time altogether cooled down, and Hamilton's\r\nanswer was brief and discouraging. \"I hope,\" he wrote, \"that there is\r\ngood prospect that the war between Greece and Turkey will be averted,\r\nand therefore I trust there will be no necessity to resort to your\r\nscheme in Syria. I can, I am afraid, only say that it is conceived that\r\nsuch a state of things might arise when something of the sort you\r\nsuggest might be necessary, but that the case is not considered to have\r\narisen. This is confused and enigmatic, but I fear I can say no more.\"\r\nWith this I had to be content, and I made no delay in communicating the\r\nresult to the Seyyid.\r\n\r\nThe rest of our journey that summer was without political interest. We\r\nagain visited our friends the Anezeh Bedouins, whom we found encamped\r\nnear Palmyra, but our dealings with them were merely about horses. The\r\nAnezeh care nothing about politics other than those of the desert and as\r\nlittle for the affairs of religion. They can hardly indeed be counted as\r\neven nominally Mohammedans, as they neither fast nor pray nor practice\r\nany Moslem observance. Their only connection with Islam is that they\r\nhave in common with it the old Arabian customary law on which the law of\r\nthe Sheriat was founded, but they do not, as far as I have ever been\r\nable to ascertain, hold any of the Moslem beliefs except vaguely and\r\nnegatively the unity of God. They are without respect for Prophet or\r\nSaint or Koran, and know nothing whatever of a future life. With them we\r\ntravelled northwards to the border of their wanderings and found\r\nourselves at the beginning of the summer heat at Aleppo, and soon after\r\nonce more in England.[6]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[6] It is worth recording that while at Aleppo on this occasion we made\r\nfriends with two English officers afterwards prominently connected with\r\nEgypt and the Soudanese war, Colonel Stewart, who shared with Gordon in\r\nthe defence of Khartoum against the Mahdi, and Colonel Sir Charles\r\nWilson who succeeded to the command of the British army at Metemneh\r\nafter the battle of Abu Klea. Stewart, at my suggestion, made a tour\r\nthat summer among the Anazeh and Shammar Bedouins, but failed to get on\r\ngood terms with them, the truth being that he was quite out of sympathy\r\nwith Orientals. Wilson, a man of far wider ideals, accompanied us on our\r\nhomeward journey as far as Smyrna, which we reached in the time of\r\nMidhat Pasha's arrest. Both were at that date Consuls in Asia Minor of\r\nthe perambulating kind provided by the terms of the Cyprus Convention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nBEGINNINGS OF THE REVOLUTION IN EGYPT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe summer of 1881 I spent almost entirely at Crabbet, writing the book\r\nwhich was the fruit of my winter experience: \"The Future of Islam.\" It\r\nwas composed somewhat in haste and under circumstances unfavourable to\r\ndeliberate judgment, for in the very act of writing it, events crowded\r\nso closely on events, and portents upon portents that a calm forecast of\r\nIslam's destiny seemed at times almost impossible. Nevertheless, and in\r\nspite of many defects, I look upon the work as still of serious value,\r\nif only historically, as showing the condition of the Mohammedan hopes\r\nand fears of the day when it was written. In it I committed myself\r\nwithout reserve to the Cause of Islam as essentially the \"Cause of Good\"\r\nover an immense portion of the world, and to be encouraged, not\r\nrepressed, by all who cared for the welfare of mankind. I gave an\r\nhistorical sketch of its origin, its glories, and its apparent decay, a\r\ndecay which was very similar to that which had seemed to overtake\r\nChristendom four hundred years before, and which might be met as\r\nChristendom had met its troubles by a religious reformation and the\r\nfreeing of its thought from the bondage of a too strict tradition\r\nimpeding its evolution. I expounded the ideas, as I had learned them\r\nfrom Sheykh Abdu, of the liberal school of teaching, and appealed to all\r\nthat was best among my own countrymen to sympathize with their hopes as\r\nagainst the party of reaction which, hide-bound in the old and evil\r\nways, had nothing to offer but a recrudescence of fanaticism and a last\r\ndesperate appeal against its many enemies to the sword. To England\r\nespecially, as interested so largely in the future of Islam through\r\nIndia, I addressed myself, urging that her policy should be an active\r\none of friendship with the better elements of Eastern thought in its\r\nstruggle with the worse, not merely to profit by its decay for the\r\nextension of her own material interests. \"The main point,\" I said, \"is\r\nthat England should fulfil the trust she has accepted (by her\r\ninheritance of the Mogul Empire and her long connection with Ottoman\r\naffairs) of developing, not destroying the existing elements of good in\r\nAsia. She cannot destroy Islam or dissolve her own connection with her.\r\nTherefore, in God's name, let her take Islam by the hand and encourage\r\nher boldly in the path of virtue. This is the only worthy course and the\r\nonly wise one, wiser and worthier, I venture to assert, than a whole\r\ncentury of crusade.\"\r\n\r\nThe chapters of this little volume, as they came out in monthly numbers\r\nof the \"Fortnightly Review,\" produced a considerable effect in England\r\nand also among the English-reading Moslems of India, and found their\r\nway, to some extent, in translation to Egypt. Already, while I was\r\nwriting them, it had become clear that great events were imminent in the\r\nMohammedan world and were even now in progress. Early in May the French\r\nGovernment with hardly a note of warning, and in pursuance of the secret\r\narrangement made at Berlin three years before between M. Waddington and\r\nour Foreign Office, invaded Tunis and, on the fanciful pretext of\r\nprotecting the Bey from a quite unreal danger threatened him by his\r\nsubjects, occupied the western portion of the Regency and proclaimed a\r\nFrench Protectorate. This sudden act of aggression on a perfectly\r\ninoffensive and harmless neighbour was justified by nothing in the\r\ncondition of the province either in the way of ill government or danger\r\nto Europeans or even financial embarrassment. The Bey himself was a mild\r\nand respectable personage, and had in no way forfeited the goodwill of\r\nhis people. The seizure of his person by General Bréart, and the\r\nusurpation of his authority by the French Republic was an act of cynical\r\nillegality almost without parallel in the history of modern aggression\r\nupon weaker nations, if we except the invasion of Egypt by Bonaparte in\r\n1799, and was generally condemned in England where the history of the\r\nBerlin betrayal was not as yet suspected. In the Mohammedan world it lit\r\na flame of anger and dismay which gathered in intensity as the truth\r\nbecame slowly known. The western Tunisians, taken wholly by surprise at\r\nfirst, had hardly fired a shot against the French, and the Bey had been\r\nforced to sign the Treaty presented to him at the sword's point by\r\nBréart, which surrendered the independence of the Regency, before the\r\nreal state of the case came to be understood. But in the eastern\r\nprovinces the tribes of the desert took up arms, and before the middle\r\nof summer the revolt had spread to the Algerian Sahara and a wave of\r\nanger against Christendom was rolling eastwards which, as will be seen,\r\nhad begun to affect Egypt dangerously, and remains in truth to this day\r\nresponsible for precipitating the action of the liberal reformers there\r\nand of the army in demanding self government.\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting, as showing the complicity of our Government in this\r\nscandalous affair, that Lord Granville allowed himself to be content\r\nwith an assurance given him by the French Government, that the\r\noccupation of the Regency was only for the restoration of order, though\r\nit was patent that order had not been so much as threatened, and that it\r\nwould not continue a day longer than might be necessary to secure the\r\nsafety of the Bey's Government--a line of falsehood closely imitated by\r\nLord Granville himself the following year when the positions of France\r\nand England were reversed in Egypt. It is most noticeable too that,\r\nthough Parliament was sitting at the time, Lord Salisbury, the leader of\r\nthe opposition, maintained an absolute silence about Tunis, though his\r\nfollowers, who did not know his secret reasons, were clamorous for\r\nexplanations. Bismarck was equally silent at Berlin, and no single Power\r\nof those who had been represented at Berlin dissented, though the\r\nItalian public was deeply aggrieved by the French action. The Sultan\r\nalone of them recorded his public protest, Tunis having been always\r\nreckoned as part of the Ottoman dominions. By the European Governments\r\nit was accepted speedily as a _fait accompli_.\r\n\r\nThe history of the rise of what in the summer of 1881 began to be known\r\nas the Egyptian National movement needs here to be told. It had its\r\norigin as a practical idea in the last desperate efforts made by the\r\nKhedive Ismaïl when he had quarrelled with Wilson to maintain himself in\r\npower against the consular tutelage in which he had, by his folly and\r\nhis debts, placed himself. He sought to recover the moral status he had\r\nlost and the goodwill of his subjects by making to them a popular appeal\r\nfor support, and in the spring of 1879 he proclaimed his intention of\r\ncalling together an assembly of Notables. There is little doubt that his\r\nintention was, under the cloak of a national demand, to repudiate at\r\nleast a portion of the debt, and though no one in Egypt, except perhaps\r\ncertain European residents, thought him sincere, the idea of a\r\nconstitutional form of government as a remedy for the ills they were\r\nsuffering began from that time to be popularized at Cairo. Sheykhs\r\nJemal-ed-din and his school had always maintained that the growing\r\nabsolutism of Mohammedan princes in modern times was contrary to the\r\nspirit of Islam which in its essence was a Republic where every Moslem\r\nhad the right of free speech in its assemblies, and where the authority\r\nof the ruler rested on his conformity to the law and on popular\r\napproval. Ismaïl was condemned by the Azhar reformers on the double\r\nground of his being a breaker of the law and a political tyrant. In the\r\nspring of 1879 it had been much discussed among them in private how, and\r\nby what means, he could be deposed or even, if there were no other way,\r\nremoved by assassination. It was the consciousness of his double peril,\r\nboth at home and from Europe, and of the opinions held at the Azhar that\r\ndetermined him to appear as a Constitutionalist. Constitutionalism, it\r\nmust, moreover, be remembered, was much in the air just then not only in\r\nEgypt, but at Constantinople, where an assembly had met convoked by\r\ndecree of the Sultan only five years before. Little, therefore, as\r\nIsmaïl was trusted by the Reformers, his new move was one of which they\r\ncould not but approve, and it was taken up and expounded by such printed\r\norgans of opinion as had furtively begun to be established at Cairo\r\nunder their direction. Apart from the Azhar, there were not a few of the\r\nhigh officials who at this time were Constitutionalists, notably Sherif\r\nPasha, Ali Pasha Mubarak and Mahmud Bey Sami el Barodi. Nor was this\r\nall. The Khedive's heir apparent and eventual successor, Mohammed\r\nTewfik, had come under Jemal-ed-din's potent influence, and through him\r\nwas in close communication with the Reformers, and had given them\r\nrepeated pledges that if ever he came to the Khedivial throne he\r\nwould govern on strictly constitutional lines. Ismaïl's latest\r\nMinistry, which lasted three months, included Tewfik and Sherif,\r\nConstitutionalists both, and they were actually in charge of the\r\nadministration when the old Khedive was deposed.\r\n\r\nTewfik's accession was therefore greeted by Jemal-ed-din and the\r\nReformers as a stroke of good fortune, and, though they regretted that\r\nit had not been in the power of the Egyptians themselves to depose the\r\ntyrant, they looked forward to the new _régime_ with the confident\r\nexpectation of men who had at last obtained a lever to their wishes. The\r\nnew Khedive, however, like many another heir apparent when he has\r\nsucceeded to power, was not long in changing his opinion, and a month\r\nhad hardly elapsed before he had forgotten his promises and betrayed his\r\nfriends. Tewfik's character was one of extreme weakness. The son of a\r\nwoman who had been a servant only in his father's house, he had been\r\nfrom his childhood treated as of small account by Ismaïl and brought up\r\nby his mother in bodily fear of the unscrupulous Khedive, and in those\r\nhabits of insincerity and dissimulation which in the East are the\r\ntraditional safeguards of the unprotected. He had grown up in this way,\r\nin the harem more than with men, and had been unable to rid himself of a\r\ncertain womanish timidity which prompted him always to yield his opinion\r\nin the presence of a stronger will than his own, and after yielding, to\r\nregain his ground, if possible, by indirect means and covertly as is the\r\nhabit of women. He had, too, a large share of the womanish quality of\r\njealousy and of the love of small vengeances. Otherwise, in his domestic\r\nlife he was well-conducted as compared with most of his predecessors,\r\nand not unadorned with respectable virtues. As a ruler his was too\r\nnegative a character not to be a danger to those who had to deal with\r\nhim. His first impulse was always to conceal the truth and to place upon\r\nothers the blame of any failure that might have occurred by his fault.\r\nHis resentments were shown not by open displeasure, but by tale-bearing\r\nand false suggestion and the setting of one against another where he\r\ndesired to prevail or be revenged. It has been said of him that he was\r\nnever sincere, and that no one ever trusted him who was not betrayed.\r\n\r\nWhen therefore on his accession Tewfik found himself placed between two\r\nforces with opposite ends in view, the force of his reforming friends\r\nurging him to fulfil his constitutional promises, and the force of the\r\nconsulates forbidding him to part with any of his power, a power they\r\nintended to exercise in his name themselves, he consented first to his\r\nMinister Sherif's suggestion that he should issue a decree granting a\r\nConstitution and then at the instance of the Consuls refused to sign it.\r\nThis led to Sherif's resignation, and the substitution in his place of a\r\nnominee of the Consulates, Riaz Pasha, on whom these counted to carry\r\nout their ideas of financial reform while leaving him full power, under\r\nthe Rescript of 1878, to carry on the internal administration as he\r\nwould, without check from any Council or Assembly, in the Khedive's\r\nname. The weakness shown by the Khedive in this, the first important\r\ndecision of his reign, was the cause of all his future troubles. Had he\r\nremained loyal to his promises to the Reformers and to his Ministers,\r\nand summoned at that time a Council of Notables, he would have had his\r\nsubjects enthusiastically with him and would have been spared the\r\nintrigues and counter intrigues which marked the next two years and\r\nprepared the way for the revolution of 1882. As it was, he found himself\r\nby his compliance deprived of all authority, and treated as a mere dummy\r\nprince by Consuls whose will he had obeyed and by his new Minister.\r\n\r\nThe character of Riaz has been much debated. At the time of my visit to\r\nEgypt in the autumn of 1881, his name was in execration with the\r\nNationalists as the author of the violent but abortive measures which\r\nhad been taken for their repression, but as I now think in part\r\nunjustly. Riaz was a man of the old _régime_ and as such a disbeliever\r\nin any but the most absolute forms of government, and he carried on the\r\nadministration while in power according to the received methods which\r\nhad prevailed in Ismaïl's time, by espionage, police rule, arrests, and\r\ndeportations. But he was neither unjust nor personally cruel, and he was\r\ncertainly animated throughout his public career by a real sense of\r\npatriotism. His idea in taking office under the joint control of the\r\nEnglish and French Consulates, and the assistance he gave them in\r\nopposition to the popular will, was, as he has since assured me, simply\r\nto recover Egypt from its financial misfortunes and redeem the debt and\r\nso get rid as speedily as possible of the foreign intervention, nor is\r\nthere any doubt that in the first year of his being in office great\r\nprogress had been made in relieving the fellahin from their financial\r\nburdens. But the process of redemption must in any case have been a very\r\nslow one, and there is no probability that he would have succeeded\r\neither in freeing Egypt from the tutelage imposed on it or even of\r\nseeing the grosser evils of the administration which still weighed upon\r\nthe people sensibly relieved. The _régime_ of the Joint Control which\r\nRiaz served looked solely to finance and troubled itself hardly at all\r\nabout other matters. The fellahin were still governed mainly by the\r\nkurbash, the courts of justice were abominably corrupt, the landed\r\nclasses were universally in debt and were losing their lands to their\r\ncreditors, and the alien caste of Turks and Circassians still lorded it\r\nover the whole country. There was no sign during the period of anything\r\nin the shape of moral improvement encouraged by the Government or even\r\nof improvement in the administrative system. This was the weak side of\r\nthe Anglo-French _régime_ and the cause of its failure to win popular\r\nfavour. Nevertheless, it may be questioned whether the crisis would have\r\ncome as speedily as it did, but for the Khedive's own insincerities and\r\nintrigues against his Minister. It was his character, as I have\r\nexplained, to yield outwardly to pressure but at the same time to seek\r\nto regain his end by other means. Thus it happened that he had hardly\r\ntaken Riaz to his counsels before he began to intrigue against him. He\r\nwas jealous of his authority and grudged the power that he had given to\r\nhis too independent Minister. This is the true history of the series of\r\ncrises through which Egypt passed in 1881, including, to a large extent,\r\nthe military troubles which ended in Riaz' fall from power.\r\n\r\nThe intervention of the army during the winter of 1880-81 as a political\r\nforce in Egypt is so important a matter that it needs careful\r\nexplanation. As an element of discontent, it may be said to date from\r\nthe disastrous campaign in Abyssinia which destroyed in it the Khedivial\r\nprestige, and at the same time by the financial difficulties it had\r\ninvolved made the pay of the soldiers precarious and irregular. The men\r\nwho returned from the campaign had no longer any respect for their\r\ngenerals who had shown themselves incompetent, and the subordinate\r\nofficers for the most part made common cause against them with the men.\r\nThis came about the more naturally because the higher posts in the army\r\nwere occupied exclusively by the Turkish-speaking \"Circassian\" class\r\nwhich at that time monopolized official power, while the common soldiers\r\nand the officers to the rank of captain were almost as exclusively drawn\r\nfrom the Arabic-speaking fellahin population. The class feeling became\r\nstrong when it was precisely these that were mulcted of their pay, while\r\nthe Circassians continued to enjoy their much larger salaries\r\nundiminished. During the last three years, therefore, of Ismaïl's reign\r\nthe rank and file of the army had fully shared the general discontent of\r\nthe country, and there had been conspiracies, never made public, among\r\nthe lower officers which at one moment very nearly came to the point of\r\nviolent action. A leader in this class feeling in the army was, as early\r\nas 1877, Ahmed Bey Arabi, whose rank as lieutenant-colonel, a very\r\nunusual one to be held by a fellah, gave him a position of exceptional\r\ninfluence with his Arabic-speaking fellow countrymen. A short biography\r\nof this remarkable man will not be here out of place.\r\n\r\nArabi was born in 1840, the son of a small village sheykh, the owner of\r\neight and a half acres of land, at Horiyeh, near Zagazig, where his\r\nfamily had been long established and enjoyed a certain local\r\nconsideration of a semi-religious kind. Like many other village sheykhs\r\nthey claimed a strain of Seyyid blood in their otherwise purely fellah\r\nlineage, and had a tradition of being, on that account, somewhat\r\nsuperior to their rustic neighbours. How far this claim was a valid\r\none--and it has been disputed--I do not know, but it had at least the\r\neffect of giving them a desire for better religious education than is to\r\nbe found in the Delta villages, and Arabi, like his father, was sent as\r\na youth to Cairo and was a student there for two years at the Azhar. At\r\nthe age of fourteen he was taken for a soldier, and as he was a tall,\r\nwell-grown lad and Saïd Pasha, the then Viceroy, had a scheme for\r\ntraining the sons of village sheykhs as officers, he was pushed on\r\nthrough the lower ranks of the army, and at the early age of seventeen\r\nbecame lieutenant, captain at eighteen, major at nineteen, and Caimakam,\r\nlieutenant-colonel, at twenty. This rapid and unexampled advancement in\r\nthe case of a fellah was due in part to the protection of the French\r\ngeneral under whom he was serving, Suliman Pasha el Franzawi, but still\r\nmore to the favour shown by the Viceroy, who affected to be, like the\r\nmass of his subjects, an Egyptian, not merely a member of the alien\r\nTurkish caste, and wished to have fellah officers about him. Arabi, a\r\npresentable young fellow, even so far enjoyed his favour as to be named\r\nhis A. D. C., and in this capacity he accompanied Saïd to Medina the\r\nyear before his death. It was during this close intercourse with the\r\nViceroy that he acquired his first political ideas, which were those of\r\nequality as between class and class, and of the respect due to the\r\nfellah as the preponderating element in Egyptian nationality. It is this\r\nparticular advocacy of fellah rights which distinguished Arabi from the\r\nother reformers of his day. The Azhar movement was one of general\r\nMohammedan reform, without distinction of race. Arabi's was essentially\r\na race movement and as such far more distinctly national and destined to\r\nbe far more popular.\r\n\r\nThe unexpected death of his master, Saïd, was a great blow to Arabi's\r\nhopes. Under Ismaïl the favour shown to the fellah officers was\r\nwithdrawn, and all preferment was once more given to the Circassians.\r\nArabi found himself treated with scant courtesy by these, and was given\r\nonly subordinate duties to perform in the transport service and\r\nsemi-civilian posts. This threw him into the ranks of the discontented\r\nand made him more than ever the advocate of the rights of his own class.\r\nHe was eloquent and able to expound his views in the sort of language\r\nhis countrymen understood and appreciated, not very precise language\r\nperhaps, but illustrated with tropes and metaphors and texts from the\r\nKoran, which his Azhar education supplied. He thus exercised a\r\nconsiderable influence over those with whom he came in contact. During\r\nthis period he came a good deal into the society of Europeans,\r\nespecially at Alexandria, where he had been sent on business, not\r\naltogether military, connected with the Khedive's Daira. His relations\r\nwith these were friendly, and throughout his career he remained free\r\nfrom the least taint of fanatical intolerance in regard to Christians.\r\nOn points of religion, though his practice was strict, he belonged to\r\nthe largest and most liberal school of Mohammedan interpretation, and\r\nhe was essentially a humanitarian in his ideas of the fraternity of\r\nnations and creeds. He knew no language, however, but his own, and\r\nmaintained his integrity free from the European vices which are so\r\neasily acquired.\r\n\r\nIn the Abyssinian war Arabi saw some service, but only on the\r\ncommunication lines between Massawa and the front, and he returned from\r\nthe campaign like all the rest, incensed at the way in which it had been\r\nmismanaged. It was this that turned his attention decidedly to politics\r\nand gave a wider scope to his indignation now principally directed\r\nagainst the Khedive. This was intensified when he found himself\r\narrested, with another fellah officer, Ali Bey Roubi, on a false charge\r\nof having been concerned in the attack on Nubar, a manoeuvre of\r\nIsmaïl's intended to screen his own part in the affair; and, after his\r\nrelease, he for a moment joined with others in a plan which, however,\r\ncame to nothing, of deposing the Khedive. It is probable that, if Europe\r\nhad not intervened when it did, this result would have ultimately\r\nhappened, either through the action of the army or perhaps by Ismaïl's\r\nassassination, for such a solution too was at one time seriously\r\ndiscussed at the Azhar. All the Reforming party it is certain, and the\r\nsoldiers with them, rejoiced at Ismaïl's downfall. It is a mistake also\r\nto suppose that Arabi was at the outset hostile to the new _régime_.\r\nNeither with Tewfik nor with the European Consuls had he the smallest\r\nquarrel. On the contrary, he saw in Tewfik a friendly influence, and in\r\nthe Consuls protectors for the fellahin from their old oppressors.\r\nMoreover, he had obtained the command of a regiment of the guard, and\r\nwas quartered where he would most have desired to be, in the Abbassiyeh\r\nbarracks at Cairo. Had moderate prudence been used in dealing with the\r\nsoldiers' very real grievances, and a War Minister less hostile to the\r\nfellah officers been appointed, there is every reason to believe that\r\nneither he nor any of his fellow officers would have thought of taking\r\nup an attitude hostile to the Government. Action in self defence was\r\nforced upon them, and for this the Khedive's jealousy of Riaz was mainly\r\nresponsible.\r\n\r\nThe trouble came about in this way: when the new Ministry under Riaz was\r\nformed, Osman Rifky, a Turkish pasha of the old school, was made\r\nMinister of War. He was an extreme representative of the class which for\r\ncenturies had looked upon Egypt as their property and the fellahin as\r\ntheir slaves and servants. His attitude, therefore, towards the fellah\r\nofficers was from the first a hostile one, and in the appointments made\r\nby him it was to the Circassian, not the fellah, element in the army\r\nthat preference was always given. The soldiers too were angry at being\r\nmade use of for purposes outside their military duty, and subjected to a\r\nkind of _corvée_ of hard labour such as the digging of canals and\r\nagricultural work on the Khedivial estates, to which they had become\r\nunaccustomed, and it was for taking their part and refusing to allow the\r\nmen of his regiment to be ordered away to dig the Towfikiyeh Canal that\r\nArabi first incurred the Minister's displeasure. There were questions\r\ntoo of pay withheld which called for redress, and on the 20th of May,\r\n1880, a first petition was sent in by the fellah officers, of whom Arabi\r\nwas one, setting forth their grievances.\r\n\r\nThe address included nothing political, and was made in proper form to\r\nthe Ministry of War, and led, through the intervention of the French and\r\nEnglish Consuls, to an official inquiry which proved the justice of the\r\ncomplaints. In this matter the French Consul, M. de Ring, took the part,\r\nas was just, of the officers, and from that time gave them to a certain\r\nextent his protection, especially when during the course of the Inquiry\r\nhe had found himself in personal altercation with Riaz. Arabi in all\r\nthis, while taking a leading part, was prudent and moderate, and his\r\nconduct was approved by the Consuls. Since his return to Cairo, as\r\nColonel of the Fourth Regiment, he had renewed his acquaintance with the\r\nreformers of the Azhar and the Constitutional party, and through a\r\nmutual friend and Arabi's fellow officer Ali Bey Roubi, was in\r\ncommunication with two of the Ministers, Ali Pasha Mubarak and Mahmud\r\nBey Sami. These, though Constitutionalists and adherents of Sherif\r\nPasha, had retained their places as Ministers of Public Works and\r\nReligious Foundations (_Awkaf_) when Sherif had been dismissed. By\r\nMahmud Sami, Arabi and the fellah officers were especially befriended.\r\n\r\nIt was in this conjuncture of affairs that the Khedive, seeing in it\r\nthe elements of an intrigue against Riaz, put himself in communication\r\nwith the officers through the intermediary of his A. D. C., Ali Bey\r\nFehmi, an officer of fellah origin but attached through his Circassian\r\nwife to the Palace, and Colonel of the 1st regiment of the Guard. This\r\nAli Fehmi was a very worthy young officer, and though he had not taken\r\nany part in the petition sent in to the Ministry and was without\r\npolitical bias, was already on friendly terms with Arabi and the rest,\r\nand had no difficulty in persuading them that the Khedive too was on\r\ntheir side in the quarrel, and had sent him to warn them that worse\r\nthings were being designed against them by Osman Rifky and Riaz, and\r\nthat unless they could procure the dismissal of these they would always\r\nbe in danger. Arabi was the easier persuaded of this because Riaz had\r\nalready had many of the Constitutionalists arrested, and some of these\r\nhad been friends of his own. Sheykh Jemal-ed-din had been summarily\r\ndealt with, and a young landowner of the Sherkiyeh, Hassan Mousa el\r\nAkkad, a special friend of Arabi, had been deported only a short time\r\nbefore to the White Nile, for the mere reason that in response to an\r\ninvitation publicly made by Sir Rivers Wilson he had petitioned against\r\nthe Moukabalah confiscation. It was therefore suggested to the officers\r\nthat they should be beforehand with Osman Rifky and should petition for\r\nhis dismissal, a request which the Khedive would view favourably.\r\n\r\nThe affair came to a crisis about the end of the year 1880, when one\r\nevening, Arabi being with other officers at the house of Nejm el Din\r\nPasha, he learned that it had been decided at the Ministry that he and\r\nhis fellow Colonel of the Black Regiment, Abd-el-Aal Bey Helmi, were to\r\nbe deprived of their commands and dismissed the service; and almost at\r\nthe same time news was brought him that Ali Fehmi was at his own house\r\nand desired to see him. On returning home, therefore, he found Ali Fehmi\r\nwaiting for him, and with him Abd-el-Aal who confirmed what he had\r\nheard, and after taking counsel it was decided that they should all\r\nthree together--for Ali Fehmi expressed himself willing to throw in his\r\nlot with theirs--go to the Prime Minister and insist upon an end being\r\nput to their persecution by the dismissal of Osman Rifky; and this the\r\nnext day they did. Arabi's own account given to me of their interview\r\nwith Riaz is interesting and I have no doubt correct: \"We went,\" he\r\nsays, \"with our petition to the Ministry of the Interior and asked to\r\nsee Riaz. We were shown into an outer room and waited while the Minister\r\nread our document in the inner room. Presently he came out. 'Your\r\npetition,' he said, 'is _muhlik_, a hanging matter. What is it you want?\r\nto change the Ministry? And what would you put in its place? Whom do you\r\npropose to carry on the government?' And I answered him, '_Ya saat el\r\nBasha_, is Egypt then a woman who has borne but eight sons and then\r\nbecome barren?' By this I meant himself and the seven Ministers under\r\nhim. He was angry at this, but in the end said he would see into our\r\naffair, and so we left him.\"\r\n\r\nAt the Council of Ministers which assembled immediately after this\r\nincident the Khedive played a treacherous part. In order to involve the\r\nMinistry in an open quarrel with the officers, in which he knew the\r\nofficers would have M. de Ring's protection, he proposed that they\r\nshould be arrested and placed upon their trial by Court Martial, but to\r\nthis Osman Rifky objected because he also would thus be put on trial,\r\nwhile Riaz was against making it a case of public scandal at all, and\r\ntook the officers' part. It was pointed out however to Riaz privately\r\nthat his opposition would be misinterpreted, and would be looked upon as\r\nan act disloyal to the Khedive, and he withdrew his opposition, and a\r\ncompromise was come to according to which Osman Rifky was to be left to\r\ndeal with the officers summarily, and according to methods common in\r\nIsmaïl's reign. No open action therefore was taken against the officers,\r\nand the case was left undecided by the Council.\r\n\r\nWhat followed is well known. Some days later the three Colonels who had\r\nsigned the petition received an invitation to attend at the Kasr el Nil\r\nPalace to arrange with the Minister what part their regiment should take\r\nin some festivities which were being organized for the Princess Jamila's\r\nwedding. Arrived there, they found a number of their superior officers,\r\nCircassians, with Osman Rifky, and were at once arrested, disarmed, and\r\ninsulted. Arabi has always maintained that it was intended to put them\r\non board a steamer which was lying in the river outside, and have them\r\nconveyed up the Nile and drowned; and I see no reason to doubt that\r\nthis was the case. Osman Rifky's object was to avoid a trial, which\r\nwould have exposed his own tyrannical proceedings, and it would\r\ndoubtless have been reported that the officers had been dismissed the\r\nservice and gone to their homes. Be this however as it may, they were\r\nspeedily released by the soldiers of Ali Fehmi's regiment, who, under\r\nthe command of their major, Mohammed Obeyd, a good and loyal man who was\r\nafterwards killed at Tel-el-Kebir, marched down on news being brought\r\nand forced the Palace doors. The Circassian Generals then beat a retreat\r\nas they best could, and Osman Rifky was forced to an undignified flight\r\nthrough a ground-floor window, whereupon the three Colonels marched back\r\nat the head of their troops, and with drums beating, to their barracks.\r\nHere they drew up a letter telling what had happened, and explaining\r\nthat their action had been one of self-defence only, and in no way\r\nendangered the safety of any one, and addressed it to M. de Ring,\r\nbegging his intercession with the Khedive, and that another Minister\r\nmight be appointed in Osman Rifky's place, to which in the course of the\r\nday the Khedive readily acceded. It is certain, however, that he and M.\r\nde Ring together made a strong effort to get Riaz also dismissed, on the\r\nplea that as Prime Minister he was principally responsible for the\r\ndisorder which had happened. Nevertheless Riaz was too strongly\r\nsupported by the Financial Controllers and by the German Consul General,\r\nand, I think, by Malet, who was at that time, as I have recorded, by no\r\nmeans favourably disposed to the officers, and on the matter being\r\nreferred to London and Paris the Khedive's wish was disregarded, and\r\nshortly after M. de Ring was recalled by his Government in disgrace.\r\n\r\nThe date of this first military disturbance at the Kasr el Nil was 1st\r\nFebruary, 1881. It took place while I was still in Egypt, but after I\r\nhad left Cairo, and I do not remember to have heard Arabi's name\r\nmentioned before it happened. The public part, however, that he played\r\nthat brought him into immediate notoriety, and at once his name was in\r\nall men's mouths as that of a man who had been able successfully to defy\r\nthe Government and bring about a change of Ministers. His position in a\r\nvery few weeks became one of power in the country, or at least of\r\nimputed power, and, as the custom is in Egypt, petitions of all kinds\r\npoured in upon him from persons who had suffered wrong and who sought\r\nhis aid to get justice. The fact that he had appeared in the affair as\r\nchampion of fellah wrongs against the Turkish ruling class gave him\r\npopularity outside of Cairo, and many of the Notables and country\r\nsheykhs put themselves into communication with him. To all he returned\r\nwhat good answers he could and help as far as his limited power\r\nextended, and wherever men met him his fine presence, attractive smile,\r\nand dignified eloquence in conversation conveyed a favourable\r\nimpression.\r\n\r\nIn personal appearance Arabi was at that time singularly well endowed\r\nfor the part he was called upon to play in Egyptian history as\r\nrepresentative of his race. A typical fellah, tall, heavy-limbed, and\r\nsomewhat slow in his movements, he seemed to symbolize that massive\r\nbodily strength which is so characteristic of the laborious peasant of\r\nthe Lower Nile. He had nothing in him of the alertness of a soldier, and\r\nthere was a certain deliberation in his gesture which gave him the\r\ndignity one so often sees in village sheykhs. His features in repose\r\nwere dull, and his eyes had an abstracted look like those of a dreamer,\r\nand it was only when he smiled and spoke that one saw the kindly and\r\nlarge intelligence within. Then his face became illumined as a dull\r\nlandscape by the sun. To Turkish and Circassian pashas this type of man\r\nseemed wholly negligible, that of the peasant boor they had for\r\ngenerations dominated and held in slavery and forced to labour for them\r\nwithout pay, and it seemed impossible to them he should be used\r\notherwise than as a tool in their astute hands. Riaz from first to last\r\ndespised him, and even the intellectual Reformers of the Azhar took\r\nlittle count of him as a political force. But with his own peasant class\r\nhis rusticity was all in his favour. He was one of themselves, they\r\nperceived, but with their special qualities intensified and made\r\nglorious by the power they credited him with, and by the semi-religious\r\nculture he had acquired at the Azhar superior to their own. It must be\r\nremembered that in all Egyptian history, for at least three hundred\r\nyears, no mere fellah had ever risen to a position of any political\r\neminence in Egypt, or had appeared in the light of a reformer, or\r\nwhispered a word of possible revolt. I doubt, however, whether his\r\nqualities alone, which were after all rather negative ones, or his\r\ntalents, of which he had as yet given no proof, would have sufficed to\r\nbring him to the front as a National leader, but for the unwise\r\npersecution to which he was subjected by Riaz in the months following\r\nthe affair of Kasr el Nil, and which, through the intrigues of the\r\nMinister's political enemies, he was always able to thwart and\r\ncircumvent. The most important of these, and the man in the best\r\nposition to warn him of his dangers was the new Minister of War, Mahmud\r\nBey Sami, who, through M. de Ring's influence, had been given Osman\r\nRifky's succession, and who, as one of the ex-Minister Sherif's party,\r\nwas a strong Constitutionalist. Though not personally acquainted with\r\nArabi hitherto, he had already been friendly disposed towards him, and\r\nwith one of the fellah officers, Ali Bey Roubi, he was on terms of\r\nintimacy. Having become Minister of War, he was in a position to help\r\nthem actively, and to give them notice of designs against them such as\r\ncame to his ears; and he was able to do this the more effectively\r\nbecause he still saw little of Arabi personally, though remaining in\r\ntouch with him through Ali Roubi. He had made the officers a general\r\npromise that if at any time the Khedive joined actively against them\r\nthey would know it, even if he did not warn them directly, by his\r\nretirement from the Ministry.\r\n\r\nMahmud Samiel Barodi's part in the revolution of that year was a\r\ndetermining one in the course it took. Of a Circassian family long\r\nestablished in the country, and so of the traditional ruling class, he\r\nwas, like Sherif Pasha, a reformer and a patriot. Intellectually, he was\r\nfar superior to Arabi, and was indeed one of the most cultivated\r\nintelligences in Egypt, with a good knowledge of literature, both Arabic\r\nand Turkish, and especially of Egyptian history, besides being an\r\nelegant and distinguished poet. English writers, following the lead, or\r\nmislead, of the Blue Books, talk of him only as an intriguer, but he was\r\nsomething much more than this, and it must be remembered that in\r\nintriguing, as he undoubtedly did here against Riaz, he acted against a\r\nMinister who was of a different party from his own, and whom he had not\r\nelected to serve. At the time Riaz took office in 1879, Mahmud Sami was\r\nalready in the Ministry, and there had been an understanding that he\r\nand Ali Mubarak, who were Constitutionalists, should remain on an\r\nindependent footing as far as their own departments were concerned. In\r\nthe spring of 1881 they were both undoubtedly intriguing against Riaz,\r\nbut it was with the object of restoring their own party chief Sherif\r\nPasha, to power. This puts a different complexion upon Mahmud Sami's\r\naction, and I fancy might find many a parallel in the annals of our own\r\nEnglish Cabinets. His part, as I see it, throughout the troubles that\r\nwere coming was a perfectly loyal one, both to the Constitutional and\r\nthe National cause, and he paid dearer for his constancy, for he was a\r\nrich man and so had more to lose, than any other concerned in the\r\nrebellion.\r\n\r\nThe Khedive's part in the next seven months was far less straightforward.\r\nHe seems throughout to have been torn with irresolutions, jealousies,\r\nfears, and ambitions. Riaz' enemies had suggested to him that that\r\nmasterful Minister was plotting against him to supplant him as Khedive,\r\nan altogether absurd suspicion which he nevertheless at times gave ear\r\nto. At other times Arabi's growing popularity aroused his jealousy, and\r\nhe was constantly shifting from one dread to the other, while his\r\nambition was to regain his own or rather his father's lost authority.\r\nThe Anglo-French control irked him sorely, and he knew that by the bulk\r\nof his subjects he was disliked and despised. His Circassian\r\n_entourage_, the men of his Court, were all violent against the fellah\r\nofficers and were constantly urging him to take strong measures against\r\nthem, while Sherif Pasha and the Constitutionalists were for his making\r\nuse of them on the lines already attempted to get rid of Riaz and the\r\nConsular subjection in which he lay, by another military demonstration.\r\nSuch was the state of things in the month of August when the general\r\nferment in the Mohammedan world, caused by the French invasion of Tunis,\r\nbrought matters at Cairo to a definite crisis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTRIUMPH OF THE REFORMERS IN EGYPT\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to determine the precise part played by the Khedive in\r\nthe final act of the revolutionary drama, the military demonstration of\r\nthe 9th September at Abdin Palace. According to Ninet and certain other\r\nwriters there was a complete pre-arrangement and community of action\r\nbetween Tewfik that day and the military leaders with the object of\r\nbringing about the fall of Riaz and with it of the Consular tutelage in\r\nwhich Tewfik found himself enmeshed. But this is only true in a general\r\nsense. Arabi himself has always assured me that during the summer of\r\n1881 he had no personal relations with the Khedive beyond those official\r\nones which his service as colonel of one of the guard regiments\r\nentailed. He only on three occasions had speech with His Highness, and\r\non these no political subject was touched on between them. At the same\r\ntime it is quite certain that the idea of a demonstration with the\r\nobjects named had been suggested from time to time during the summer by\r\nTewfik to the officers through the intermediary of his A. D. C., Ali\r\nFehmi. Ali Fehmi, though he had been concerned with Arabi in the affairs\r\nof the Kasr-el-Nil and had been arrested with him, was none the less\r\nreceived back into the Khedive's favour, who thought to make use of him\r\nstill in the double capacity of spy on the fellah officers and\r\nintermediary, if he required it, with them. Ali Fehmi's connection with\r\nthe Court through his marriage seemed to Tewfik a guarantee of his\r\nfidelity, and it was on account of his ultimately siding entirely with\r\nArabi, notwithstanding his Court connection, that Tewfik's resentment\r\nwas afterwards so bitter against him. Tewfik, however, was a man, as we\r\nhave seen him, of varying moods, and while he still counted on the help\r\nof the army to rid himself of Riaz he was also swayed by occasional\r\nfits of jealousy of Arabi's rapidly growing popularity. This popularity\r\nwas very marked all through the summer months and brought him into\r\ncommunication with innumerable country sheykhs and Notables to whom the\r\nidea of fellah emancipation which he preached was naturally congenial.\r\nHe began to be talked of in the provinces as \"_el wahhíd_\" the \"only\r\none,\" and in truth he deserved the appellation, for he was the only man\r\nof purely fellah origin who had for centuries been able to resist\r\nsuccessfully the tyranny of the reigning Turco-Circassian caste.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be too strongly emphasized that the National movement of 1881\r\nwas essentially a fellah movement, having for its object the\r\nemancipation of the fellahin, and that it was directed primarily against\r\nthe iniquitous Turkish Government, which had ruined the country, and\r\nonly incidentally against the Anglo-French control when this last\r\ndeclared itself openly the ally and supporter of that tyranny. Other\r\ninterests, however, naturally joined in with the movement; and besides\r\nbeing sought out by the fellah Notables, Arabi soon found himself\r\napproached as an ally by the professed Constitutionalists, many of whom\r\nwere members of the ruling caste, and were at heart as much opposed to\r\nfellah liberty as was Riaz himself. The idea of a Constitution in the\r\nminds of men of this class was one in which the supreme power,\r\nthough taken from the Khedive, should remain in the hands of the\r\nTurco-Circassian oligarchy, the only ones they considered capable of\r\ngoverning the country. The chief of these Turkish Constitutionalists was\r\nSherif Pasha, and the course of the summer found him in indirect but\r\nclose correspondence with Arabi as the means of bringing about the\r\nConstitution which should be the road for him to a resumption of office.\r\nArabi, always sympathetic to the Constitutional plan, lent himself\r\nreadily to the idea, and the more so because Sultan Pasha, the most\r\npowerful of the fellah Notables, was himself a strong Constitutionalist,\r\nand acted as intermediary between him and Sherif. It was arranged\r\nbetween them all that, when a favourable moment should occur, Arabi\r\nshould add the weight of the army's influence to any pressure that it\r\nmight be necessary to bring to bear upon the Khedive to obtain his\r\nconsent to the Constitutional demand. Nor was the Khedive by any means\r\naverse from the thing demanded, as it necessarily included the dismissal\r\nof Riaz, an object still to him of prime importance; and, at the time\r\nwhen this feeling predominated in his mind, he, through Ali Fehmi,\r\nencouraged Arabi to go forward with his plan and assured him of his\r\napproval.\r\n\r\nThe first message received by Arabi in this sense was one very\r\ncharacteristic of Tewfik's indirect and timid methods of intrigue.\r\nSpeaking one day with Ali Fehmi about the growing power of the army as a\r\npolitical influence, he said: \"You three, Arabi, Abd-el-Aal, and\r\nyourself, are three soldiers--with me you make four.\" And he bade him\r\ndeliver this declaration as a message to Arabi. It was followed by hints\r\nfar more direct, so that it was soon accepted as certain that any\r\ndemonstration that might be made by the army which should demand Riaz'\r\ndismissal would have the Khedive's secret approval if not his open\r\nfavour. It was necessary, in order to put constraint upon the Consuls,\r\nthat the Khedive should seem to yield to a physical necessity when\r\nconsenting to a change of Ministers.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, when the moment for action actually arrived, it was far\r\nfrom certain what line the Khedive would take. The crisis came about in\r\nthis way. In the month of August Riaz Pasha, who up to then had despised\r\nthe fellah movement too completely to think it at all dangerous, became\r\nfor the first time alarmed. The part in it played by the soldiers he had\r\nthought to be able to cope with by some of those irregular methods which\r\nare the time-honoured tradition of Turkish Government. He had beset\r\nArabi and his fellow colonels with spies and had sought constantly to\r\ninvolve them through the police in some personal quarrel or street\r\ndisturbance which should put them in his power, but always in vain. The\r\nsoldiers invariably received warning of any serious design through their\r\nfriend at the War Office, Mahmud Sami, and were constantly on their\r\nguard. It had been arranged, too, between Mahmud Sami and Arabi that if\r\never the Minister should be forced to retire from the War Office, it\r\nwould be a sign to the fellah officers that they must expect the worst,\r\neven if they should hear nothing of it from himself. When, therefore, in\r\nAugust Riaz, losing patience, quarrelled with the War Minister and it\r\nwas announced that Mahmud Sami had resigned, the officers saw that the\r\nmoment for action, as far as they were themselves concerned, could not\r\nlong be delayed. Riaz had insisted with Mahmud Sami on the banishment of\r\nthe two leading colonels with their regiments from Cairo and had got the\r\nKhedive, in one of his fits of jealousy at Arabi's popularity, to go\r\nwith him in ordering it, and when Mahmud Sami demurred, his dismissal\r\nhad been summarily announced to him. The Khedive and Riaz were at the\r\ntime away still for the summer season at Alexandria, and Mahmud Sami, in\r\nhis disgrace, had been ordered by letter to leave Cairo at once for his\r\nvillage, and so had not had time to communicate with his military\r\nfriends. These, nevertheless, knew that trouble was in store for them,\r\nand it was the more apparent because Mahmud Sami's successor was no\r\nother than a certain Circassian general of the worst reactionary type,\r\nDaoud Pasha Yeghen, the Khedive's brother-in-law, whom they knew to be\r\nespecially their enemy. In the first days of September the Court\r\nreturned to Cairo, and the colonels, having taken counsel only with\r\nSultan Pasha and their most intimate civilian allies, prepared for\r\nimmediate action. They were resolved that, which way soever the Khedive\r\nmight now be inclined towards them, they would carry out the projected\r\ndemonstration and insist on a change of Ministry as a guarantee of their\r\npersonal security. They saw plainly enough that if they allowed\r\nthemselves to be separated from each other and removed from Cairo it\r\nwould be an easy matter for Riaz to ruin them in detail. The least they\r\nmight expect at his hands would be dismissal from the service, and it\r\nwas far more likely that they would be arrested and tried for mutiny in\r\nconnection with their doings in February. It was part, too, of their\r\nprogram to obtain an increase of the army, and they added to it a demand\r\nof the Constitution, which seemed to all the only permanent guarantee\r\nagainst arbitrary government.\r\n\r\nThe crisis came suddenly on the 8th of September. Daoud Pasha, who like\r\nmost men of his class held the fellah officers in supreme contempt and\r\nwho anticipated no resistance from them, issued his order for the\r\ndeparture of the two regiments, Arabi's to Alexandria and Abd-el-Aal's\r\nto Damietta, and on receiving it the colonels decided upon instant\r\naction. That they counted upon the Khedive's tolerance, if not his\r\nsympathy, is certain, and they knew his weak character too well to doubt\r\nthat, whatever he might have resolved on in counsel with Riaz the day\r\nbefore, on the day of trial he would be found on the side of the\r\nstrongest battalions. All they were in any real anxiety about was the\r\nattitude of Ali Fehmi, though on him too they counted as almost\r\ncertainly a friend. Ali Fehmi and his regiment, the first of the guard,\r\nhad been excepted from the Ministerial order of removal from Cairo, and\r\nwas still quartered at Abdin barracks, and if the Khedive was really\r\nhostile to them, and Ali obedient to orders, the result might be a\r\nconflict. Otherwise the demonstration had all the probability of\r\nbeing a pacific one. In order, however, to minimize the risk of a\r\nmisunderstanding they sent word in writing to the Khedive apprising him\r\nof their plans, and as a proof that there was no hostility intended to\r\nhimself declared that they would not march to his residence in the\r\nIsmaïlyeh quarter but to Abdin, the official palace, and begged him\r\nthere to meet them and hear their complaints.\r\n\r\nThe rest may be best told in Arabi's own words: \"The next morning,\" he\r\nsays in his most complete account of the affair, \"I wrote a letter\r\nstating our demands and sent it to the Khedive at Ismaïlyeh Palace\r\nsaying that we should march to Abdin Palace at the Asr (mid-afternoon)\r\nthere to receive his answer. And the reason of our going to Abdin, and\r\nnot to Ismaïlyeh where he lived, was that Abdin was his public\r\nresidence, and we did not wish to alarm the ladies of his household. But\r\nif he had not come to Abdin we should have marched on to Ismaïlyeh.\r\nWhen, therefore, the Khedive received our message he sent for Riaz Pasha\r\nand Khairi Pasha and Stone Pasha (the American), and they went first to\r\nAbdin barracks, where both the Khedive and Riaz Pasha spoke to the\r\nsoldiers, and they gave orders to Ali Fehmi that he should, with his\r\nregiment, occupy the palace of Abdin. And Ali Fehmi assented, and he\r\nposted his men in the upper rooms out of sight, so that they should be\r\nready to fire at us from the windows. But I do not know whether they\r\nwere given ball cartridge or not. Then the Khedive, with the Generals,\r\nwent on to the Kaláa (citadel), and they spoke to the soldiers there in\r\nthe same sense, calling on Fuda Bey to support the Khedive against us,\r\nthe Khedive scolding him and threatening 'I shall put you in prison.'\r\nBut the soldiers surrounded the carriage, and the Khedive was afraid and\r\ndrove away. And he went on by the advice of Riaz to Abbassiyeh to speak\r\nto me. But I had already marched with my regiment by the Hassaniyeh\r\nquarter to Abdin. And they stopped to ask about the artillery and were\r\ntold that it also had gone to Abdin.\r\n\r\n\"And when the Khedive arrived at Abdin he found us occupying the square,\r\nthe artillery and cavalry being before the west entrance and I with my\r\ntroops before the main entrance. And already when I arrived before the\r\nPalace I had sent to Ali Fehmi who, I had heard, was there and had\r\nspoken with him and he had withdrawn his men from the Palace, and they\r\nand Ali Fehmi stood with us. And the Khedive entered by the back door on\r\nthe east side, and presently he came out to us with his Generals and\r\naides-de-camp, but I did not see Colvin with him though he may have been\r\nthere. And the Khedive called on me to dismount and I dismounted. And he\r\ncalled on me to put up my sword, and I put up my sword; but the\r\nofficers, my friends, approached with me to prevent treachery, about\r\nfifty in number, and some of them placed themselves between him and the\r\npalace. And, when I had delivered my message and made my three demands\r\nto the Khedive, he said 'I am Khedive of the country and I shall do as I\r\nplease' (in the Egyptian patois) '_ana Khedeywi el beled, wa amal zay ma\r\ninni awze_.' I replied, 'We are not slaves and shall never from this day\r\nforth be _inherited_' (_nahnu ma abid, wa la nurithu bad el yom_). That\r\nis to say, 'We shall never be, as slaves are, subject to being\r\nbequeathed by will from one master to another.' He said nothing more,\r\nbut turned and went back into the palace. And presently they sent out\r\nCookson to me with an interpreter, and he asked why, being a soldier, I\r\nmade demand of a parliament. And I said that it was to put an end to\r\narbitrary rule, and I pointed to the crowd of citizens supporting us\r\nbehind the soldiers. Then he threatened me, saying 'But we will bring a\r\nBritish army'; and much discussion took place between us. And he\r\nreturned six or seven times to the palace, and came out again six or\r\nseven times to me, until finally he informed me that the Khedive had\r\nagreed to all. And the Khedive mentioned Haidar Pasha to replace Riaz,\r\nbut I would not consent. And when it was put to me to say it, I named\r\nSherif Pasha, because he had declared himself in favour of a _Mejliss-el\r\nNawwab_, Council of Notables. I had known Sherif a little in former\r\nyears when he was serving in the army. And the same evening the Khedive\r\nsent for me, and I went to him at the Ismaïlia Palace, and I thanked him\r\nfor having agreed to our requests, but he said only: 'That is enough, go\r\nnow and occupy Abdin, but let it be without music in the streets.'\"\r\n\r\nThis seems to me a very straightforward account and agrees with\r\neverything else that I have been able to learn about the events of the\r\nday from native evidence, and even in a general way with the Blue Books.\r\nThe Khedive's part in it was, according to its showing, hardly heroic,\r\nbut it was less a case with him of physical cowardice than the English\r\nofficial account suggests. He knew perfectly well that he ran no danger\r\nfrom the soldiers, nor was there anything they had asked of him that he\r\nwas not quite willing to grant or at least to promise. He stood, as they\r\nsay, to win in either event, and was in the secret of much that, to\r\nCookson and Colvin, was altogether a mystery.\r\n\r\nThese two Englishmen, mentioned by Arabi, were respectively Sir Charles\r\nCookson, the British Consul at Alexandria temporarily in charge of the\r\nEnglish Agency in Malet's absence on leave at Cairo, and Sir Auckland\r\nColvin, the English Financial Controller. They were almost the sole\r\nrepresentatives of the Foreign official body then in Egypt--for M. de\r\nSinkiewicz, the new French Minister, had not yet arrived, and M. de\r\nBlignières, Colvin's French colleague, was also away. They had,\r\ntherefore, the leading part to play in advising the Khedive and\r\nreporting the matter home. Colvin, an Indian official with the\r\ntraditions of the Anglo-Indian art of government, and being quite\r\nunsuspicious of the semi-understanding there was between Tewfik and the\r\nofficers, was all for violent measures, and recommended that the Khedive\r\nshould adopt such an attitude towards them as might have been taken\r\nsuccessfully by Mohammed Ali sixty years before, but was quite unsuited\r\nto the actual circumstances. His advice was that he should without more\r\nthan a short parley shoot Arabi with a pistol with his own hand.\r\nCookson, who knew Tewfik's timidity better, though he also was ignorant\r\nof his partial collusion with the officers, was for compromise, and\r\neffected precisely that solution which Tewfik had schemed so long to\r\nobtain, namely, the dismissal of Riaz and the recall of Sherif. His\r\naccount of the affair may be read with profit in the Blue Books, as also\r\nColvin's narrative of it in the \"Times,\" to which he communicated the\r\naccount published, and in the \"Pall Mall Gazette,\" of which he was the\r\nregular correspondent. The publicity thus given to their action gained\r\nthe thanks of the English Government for both officials, and for Colvin\r\nthe honour of a knighthood and a political position in Egypt he did not\r\ntill that time possess. And so the matter ended. Riaz, who with the\r\nrecollection of Nubar's and Osman Rifky's adventures had taken no part\r\nin the discussion with the soldiers but had remained prudently inside\r\nthe Palace, received that evening his dismissal and retired to\r\nAlexandria and thence to Europe to remain there till help should come to\r\nhim from the protecting Powers; and Sherif Pasha, after some show of\r\nreluctance, was installed Prime Minister in his stead. All Egypt woke\r\nnext morning to learn that not merely a revolt but a revolution had been\r\neffected, and that the long reign of arbitrary rule was, as it hoped,\r\nfor ever at an end. The Khedive had promised to assemble the Notables\r\nand grant a Constitution, and henceforth the land of the Pharaohs and\r\nthe Mamelukes and the Turkish Pashas was to be ruled according to\r\nthe laws of justice and administered not by aliens but by the\r\nrepresentatives of the Egyptian people themselves.\r\n\r\nThe three months which followed this notable event were the happiest\r\ntime, politically, that Egypt has ever known. I am glad that I had the\r\nprivilege of witnessing it with my own eyes and so that I know it not\r\nmerely by hearsay, or I should doubt its reality, so little like was it\r\nto anything that I had hitherto seen or am likely, I fear, ever to see\r\nagain. All native parties and, for the moment, the whole population of\r\nCairo were united in the realization of a great national idea, the\r\nKhedive no less it seemed than the rest. He was delighted, now the\r\ncrisis was over, in the success of his plot for getting rid of Riaz, and\r\nwith him the most irksome features of the Dual Control, and he trusted\r\nin Sherif to rid him sooner or later of Arabi. Sherif and the Turkish\r\nliberal magnates were no less elated at their return to power, and even\r\nthe reactionary Turks, who were by no means at one with Riaz, shared in\r\nwhat they considered a triumph against Europe. The soldiers were\r\nrelieved of the incubus of danger which had so long weighed on them, and\r\nthe civilian reformers rejoiced at the civil liberties they now looked\r\non as assured. Those who had most doubted and held back longest\r\nacknowledged that the appeal to force with its bloodless victory had\r\nbeen justified by results. Throughout Egypt a cry of jubilation arose\r\nsuch as for hundreds of years had not been heard upon the Nile, and it\r\nis literally true that in the streets of Cairo men stopped each other,\r\nthough strangers, to embrace and rejoice together at the astonishing new\r\nreign of liberty which had suddenly begun for them, like the dawn of day\r\nafter a long night of fear. The Press, under Sheykh Mohammed Abdu's\r\nenlightened censorship, freed more than ever from its old trammels,\r\nspread the news rapidly, and men at last could meet and speak fearlessly\r\neverywhere in the provinces without the dread of spies or of police\r\ninterference. All classes were infected with the same happy spirit,\r\nMoslems, Christians, Jews, men of all religions and all races, including\r\nnot a few Europeans of those at all intimately connected with native\r\nlife. Even the foreign Consuls could not but confess that the new\r\n_régime_ was better than the old, that Riaz had made mistakes, and that\r\nArabi, if he had not been wholly right, had at least not been wholly\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\nArabi's attitude both towards the Khedive and towards the new Ministers\r\nwas correct and dignified. He had several interviews with Tewfik which,\r\nat any rate on Arabi's side, were of a most cordial character, while\r\nwith the Sherif and Mahmud Sami (restored as Minister of War) he showed\r\nhimself perfectly willing, now his work was done and the liberty of the\r\ncountry obtained, to stand aside and leave its development to his\r\ncivilian friends. All his speeches of that time--and some of them are to\r\nbe read in the Blue Books--are in this reasonable sense and reveal him\r\nas deeply imbued with those lofty and romantic humanitarian views which\r\nwere a leading feature of his political career. There is not a trace in\r\nthem of anything but a large-minded sympathy with men of all classes and\r\ncreeds, nor is it possible to detect unfriendliness even to the European\r\nfinancial control whose beneficial influence on Egypt he, on the\r\ncontrary, cheerfully acknowledges. The old _régime_ of Turkish\r\nabsolutism is past and done with--that is the theme of most of the\r\nspeeches--and a new era of national freedom, peace, and goodwill to all\r\nmen has begun. On the 2nd of October, a fortnight after Sherif's\r\ninstallation at the Ministry, we find Arabi leaving Cairo with his\r\nregiment for Ras-el-Wady amid the universal enthusiasm of a grateful\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nThere was only one cloud at that date visible on the Egyptian horizon,\r\nthe possible hostility of the Sultan to the idea of a Constitution.\r\nAbdul Hamid, after playing for a while with Constitutionalism at\r\nConstantinople, had shown himself at last its implacable enemy, and that\r\nvery summer had ordered the mock trial and condemnation of Midhat, its\r\nmost prominent advocate. The appearance, therefore, of a Special\r\nCommission at Cairo early in October representing the Sultan and\r\ninstructed to inquire into what was happening in Egypt disturbed, to a\r\ncertain extent, men's minds, and doubtless hastened the departure both\r\nof Arabi to Ras-el-Wady and of Abd-el-Aal to Damietta. The visit,\r\nhowever, of the Commissioners passed off quietly. The new Ministers were\r\nable to explain that in the political movement which was now avowedly a\r\nnational one, no disloyalty was intended to the Sultan. On the contrary,\r\nthe fate of Tunis had convinced the Egyptians that their only safety\r\nfrom European aggression lay in strengthening, not loosening, the link\r\nwhich bound them to the Ottoman Empire, and that in reality the object\r\nof the Revolution had been to prevent further encroachments by the\r\nFinancial Control of France and England on Egypt's political\r\nindependence. All was for the best, and the country was now content and\r\npacified. Ali Pasha Nizami, the chief commissioner, was consequently\r\nable to take back with him a favourable report of the situation, and\r\nthis was strengthened by the second commissioner, Ahmed Pasha Ratib,\r\nwho had an opportunity of personal talk with Arabi on his way to Suez\r\nand Mecca.\r\n\r\nThis interview, which had important consequences later for the growth of\r\nthe political situation, took place in the train between Zagazig and\r\nTel-el-Kebir, Arabi had assured me on his part an accidental one, he\r\nhaving gone to Zagazig to visit his friends Ahmed Eff. Shemsi and\r\nSuliman Pasha Abaza and being on his way home. \"As I was returning,\" he\r\nhas told me, \"by train to Ras-el-Wady it happened that Ahmed Pasha Ratib\r\nwas on his way to Suez, for he was going on to Mecca on pilgrimage. And\r\nI found myself in the same carriage with him, and we exchanged\r\ncompliments as strangers, and I asked him his name and he asked me my\r\nname, and he told me of his pilgrimage and other things. But he did not\r\nspeak of his mission to the Khedive, nor did I ask. But I told him I was\r\nloyal to the Sultan as the head of our religion, and I also related to\r\nhim all that had occurred, and he said, 'You did well.' And at\r\nRas-el-Wady I left him, and he sent me a Koran from Jeddah, and later,\r\non his return to Stamboul, he wrote to me, saying that he had spoken\r\nfavourably of me to the Sultan, and finally I received the letter\r\ndictated by the Sultan to Sheykh Mohammed Zaffer telling me the things\r\nyou know of.\" The Ottoman Commission therefore passed off without\r\nleading to any immediate trouble. It was coincident with the arrival at\r\nAlexandria of a French and an English gunboat, which had been ordered\r\nthere by the two Governments at the moment of receiving the news of the\r\ndemonstration at Abdin; and the gunboats and the commissioners left on\r\nthe same day in October. Malet by this time had returned to his post,\r\nand so had Sinkiewicz, and it was agreed between them that the situation\r\nneeded no active intervention. Malet indeed wrote at that time in the\r\nmost favourable terms to his Government both of the new Ministers and of\r\nArabi, whose honesty and patriotism, though he had had no personal\r\ncommunication with him, he was now inclined to believe in.\r\n\r\nIt was at this junction of affairs in Egypt that early in November I\r\nreturned to Cairo. I had had no recent news from my Azhar friends, and\r\nwas ignorant of what had happened there during the summer beyond what\r\nall the world knew, and it was not even my intention when leaving\r\nLondon to do more than pass through the Suez Canal on my way back (for\r\nsuch was again my plan for the winter) to Arabia. I had been deeply\r\ninterested in the crisis which was being witnessed throughout the\r\nMohammedan world, and I still hoped to be able to take some personal\r\npart in the great events I saw impending--I hardly knew what, except\r\nthat it should be as a helper in the cause of Arabian and Mohammedan\r\nliberty. When the revolt took place in Algeria in connection with the\r\nFrench aggression on Tunis, I had written to my friend Seyyid Mohammed\r\nAbd-el-Kader at Damascus asking him for an introduction to its leader,\r\nAbu Yemama, but this he had not been able to give, and I had also tried\r\nin vain to discover Sheykh Jemal-ed-din Afghani's whereabouts in\r\nAmerica, where, after wandering two years in India, he was said to be,\r\nand now my thoughts were once more turned to Arabia which I had come to\r\nlook upon as a sacred land, the cradle of Eastern liberty and true\r\nreligion. Strangely enough, I did not suspect that in the National\r\nmovement in Egypt the chief interest for me in Islam already lay, as it\r\nwere, close to my hand, and it was a mere accident that determined my\r\ntaking any part in what was coming there, even as a spectator.\r\n\r\nThe reason for my blindness and indifference was that in England the\r\nevents of September had been represented in the Press as purely\r\nmilitary, and even at the Foreign Office there was no knowledge of their\r\ntrue significance. I share with most lovers of liberty a distrust of\r\nprofessional soldiers as the champions of any cause not that of tyranny,\r\nand I found it difficult to believe, even as far as Malet did, that\r\nArabi had an honest purpose in what he had done. I knew also that Sheykh\r\nMohammed Abdu and the rest of my Azhar friends were for other methods\r\nthan those of violence, and that the reforms they had so long been\r\npreaching would in their opinion take a lifetime to achieve. It seemed\r\nimpossible to understand that the events of a single summer should have\r\nbrought them already to maturity. As to the promised Constitution, the\r\nLondon Press declared that it was mere talk, a pretext of the kind that\r\nthe ex-Khedive Ismaïl had made use of against Wilson, and Malet was\r\nreported to have declared that it would remain a promise only because\r\nthe Sultan whom he had seen at Constantinople on his way back to Egypt\r\nwould never allow it.\r\n\r\nThe Ottoman Commission added to my distrust of the whole movement and\r\nthe fact that Arabi had demanded an increase of the army to the number\r\nof 18,000 men. These were the common views of the day in England and I\r\nhad no special knowledge in correction of them. I remember shortly\r\nbefore leaving London, that when I called on my cousin Philip Currie at\r\nthe Foreign Office, he surprised me by expressing an opinion that\r\nperhaps there was something more in the National Movement in Egypt than\r\nappeared on the surface. \"Malet,\" he said, \"is rather inclined now to\r\nbelieve in it. I wonder you do not go there. Perhaps you might find in\r\nArabi just the man you have been looking for.\" He knew of course my\r\nideas, which he had never taken quite seriously or as more than a\r\nromantic fancy, and his words were lightly spoken and we laughed\r\ntogether without discussion. Yet afterwards I recalled them to memory\r\nand wondered that I had been so little responsive. My thoughts, however,\r\nwere fixed elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIt is worth recording that the night before I started I entertained at\r\ndinner at the Travellers' Club three of my then rather intimate friends,\r\nJohn Morley, who had recently become editor of the \"Pall Mall Gazette\"\r\nbesides being editor of the \"Fortnightly Review,\" Sir Alfred Lyall, and\r\nour Consul at Jeddah, Zohrab. With these I had a long talk about\r\nMohammedan and Eastern affairs, and it was agreed between me and Morley\r\nthat, if I found the champion of Arabian reform that I was seeking, I\r\nshould let him know and he would do his best to put his claims\r\nprominently before the English public. Morley was not as yet in\r\nParliament, but he already held a position of high influence with the\r\nGovernment through his personal connection with Chamberlain; his paper,\r\nthe \"Pall Mall,\" was one of the few Mr. Gladstone read, the only one, I\r\nbelieve, in the soundness of whose views he had any confidence. It was a\r\npleasant dinner and we all took rather enthusiastic views as to the\r\npossibilities of the future of Islam. On the subject of Egypt, however,\r\nMorley was unfortunately already under other influences than mine. His\r\ncorrespondent for the \"Pall Mall Gazette\" was no other than the\r\nFinancial Controller, Sir Auckland Colvin, and so it happened that when\r\nthe crisis came in the spring he was found, contrary to what might have\r\nbeen expected of him, on the English official and financial side, and\r\none of the strongest advocates of violent measures for the suppression\r\nof liberty.\r\n\r\nOn my way to Egypt an incident occurred which I shall have to return to\r\nwhen its full importance comes to be considered. At Charing Cross\r\nStation I found Dilke and his private secretary, Austin Lee, on their\r\nway, as I was, to Paris, and I made the whole journey in their company.\r\nDilke that day was in the highest possible spirits. His intimate friend\r\nGambetta had just, 15th November, succeeded St. Hilaire as French Prime\r\nMinister; and Dilke, who had been for the last six months the English\r\nCommissioner at Paris for the negotiation of a renewal of the Commercial\r\nTreaty with France without having succeeded in concluding it, was now\r\nreturning to his work confident that with the change at the Quai d'Orsay\r\nhe should no longer have any difficulty. Gambetta, on his side, had a\r\nplan of his own in which Dilke as Under-Secretary at the Foreign Office\r\ncould be of the greatest use to him. St. Hilaire had made a terrible\r\nmess of the Tunis invasion and had left all North Africa in a blaze for\r\nhis successor to deal with. Gambetta had come into office determined to\r\nuse strong measures, and, as they say, to \"grasp the nettle\" with both\r\nhands. He was filled with apprehension of a general Pan-Islamic rising,\r\nand saw in the National movement at Cairo only a new and dangerous\r\nmanifestation of Moslem \"fanaticism.\" He was closely connected, too,\r\nthrough his Jewish origin with the great financial interests involved in\r\nEgypt, and had made up his mind to better St. Hilaire's halting\r\naggression on Tunis by forcing our intervention also in Egypt. In this\r\nhe wanted our Government to go with him and join in an anti-Islamic\r\ncrusade in the name of civilization, and as a first measure to\r\nstrengthen the hold of the European Joint Control at Cairo. On both\r\nthese matters, the Commercial Treaty and Egypt, Dilke was most\r\ncommunicative, though he did not put all the dots upon the i's, treating\r\nthe former as a special English interest, the latter as specially a\r\nFrench one. It was a point of party honour with the Liberal Government,\r\nwhich was essentially a Free Trade Government, to show the world that\r\ntheir Free Trade declarations did not prevent them from getting\r\nreciprocity from other nations, or favorable commercial terms from\r\nprotectionist governments, and Dilke knew that it would be a feather in\r\nhis cap if he could obtain a renewal of the French concessions. So eager\r\nindeed was he about it that I distinctly remember saying to myself, half\r\naloud, as we parted at the Gare du Nord: \"That man means to sell Egypt\r\nfor his Commercial Treaty.\" Nor did the event prove it otherwise than\r\nexactly a true prophecy. It will be seen a little later that to the\r\ntrivial advantage of obtaining certain small reductions of the import\r\nduties levied on English goods in France, the whole issue of liberty in\r\nEgypt, and to a large extent of Mohammedan reform throughout the world,\r\nwas sacrificed by our Liberal Government. But of all this in its place.\r\n\r\nMy going at all to Cairo that winter was, as I have explained, somewhat\r\nfortuitous, providential I might almost say, if I was not afraid of\r\ngiving my personal action in Egypt too much importance and too high a\r\nmeaning. The ship which was to bring me out my servants and camp\r\nequipage, after nearly foundering in the Bay of Biscay, ran aground in\r\nthe Canal and I was obliged to wait at Suez. I left it for Cairo,\r\nmeaning to be there for a few days only. It had been reported in England\r\nthat the Azhar Ulema had been won back from their ideas of reform and\r\nhad adopted the Sultan's reactionary Pan-Islamic views. Half distrustful\r\nof the result, I sent a message to my first friend, at the University,\r\nSheykh Mohammed Khalil, and then another curious accident occurred. In\r\nanswer to my note begging him to come and see me at the Hôtel du Nil,\r\nwhere I had alighted, behold, instead of the young Alem whom I knew so\r\nwell, another Azhar Sheykh of the same name, Sheykh Mohammed Khalil el\r\nHajrasi, a perfect stranger who greeted me with a stranger's welcome.\r\nThe newcomer had received my message, and, thinking it had come from a\r\nEuropean merchant with whom he had dealings in connection with his\r\nnative village in the Sherkieh, had followed close upon the heels of the\r\nmessenger. This Mohammed el Hajrasi, though a man of less intrinsic\r\nworth than my real friend, was a person of some importance at the Azhar,\r\nand proved to be perhaps of even more interest to me at the moment than\r\nthe other could have been from the fact that he was intimate with the\r\nchiefs of what was then called the military party at Cairo and was\r\npersonally acquainted with Arabi. This my own Mohammed Khalil was not,\r\nand, as I presently found, neither he nor his chief Sheykh Mohammed\r\nAbdu, would have served me as an intermediary with these, for, as\r\nalready said, they had disapproved of the immixture of the army in\r\npolitical affairs in September and, though rejoicing at the result, were\r\nstill to a certain extent holding aloof. Hajrasi, however, when he had\r\nrecovered from his surprise at finding me an Englishman and not the man\r\nhe had expected, was nothing loath to talk of Arabi and his doings, and\r\nwhen I went on to explain my views to him of reform upon an Arab basis\r\nhe at once became confidential and explained to me his own views which\r\nwere not very different from mine. He was one of the principal Sheykhs,\r\nhe told me, of the Shafeite rite, and had close relations with the\r\nLiberal party of reform at Mecca, who were then in avowed opposition to\r\nAbdul Hamid and were looking forward to a new Arabian Caliphate. This\r\nwas a great point of sympathy between us, and it was not long before we\r\nhad made a full exchange of our ideas; and I think no better proof could\r\nbe given of the wonderful liberty of thought and speech which marked\r\nthose days in Egypt than that this eminent religious Sheykh, who\r\ncertainly a year before would have locked his secrets jealously in his\r\nbosom, even perhaps from a friend, should suddenly have thus unloosened\r\nhis tongue in eloquent response to my questions and should have unfolded\r\nto me, a European and a complete stranger, his most dangerous\r\naspirations in politics. It no doubt, however, was in some part due to\r\nthe presence with me of my learned Arabic professor, Sabunji, whom I had\r\nhad the happy inspiration to bring with me from London to help out my\r\npoor resources of that language.\r\n\r\nIt was thus from Hajrasi that I first learned the details of what had\r\nbeen going on at Cairo during the summer and the true position of the\r\nsoldiers in regard to the National Party, facts which I soon after had\r\nconfirmed to me from a number of other sources including my original\r\nfriends, Mohammed Khalil and Mohammed Abdu. Sabunji, moreover, who had a\r\nreal genius for this kind of work, was presently busy all the city over\r\nseeking out news for me, so that in a very few days we knew between us\r\npretty nearly everything that was going on. Nor were we long before we\r\nhad made acquaintance with some of the fellah officers who had taken\r\npart with Arabi in the demonstration, especially with Eïd Diab and Ali\r\nFehmi, with whom I was pleasantly impressed. The matters being\r\nprincipally discussed at the moment were, first, the character of the\r\nKhedive--was he to be trusted, or was he not, to fulfil the promises he\r\nhad given? He had promised a Constitution, but was this to be a real\r\ntransfer of power to Ministers responsible to a Representative Chamber,\r\nor only the summoning of a Chamber of Notables with common consultative\r\npowers? Tewfik was mistrusted on this point, and it was generally\r\nbelieved that he was being advised to shuffle in this way out of his\r\nengagement by Malet who, as already said, had just come from\r\nConstantinople and had declared that the Sultan would never agree to\r\nreal Constitutional government.\r\n\r\nThe more advanced section of the Nationalists were bitter against the\r\nwhole house of Mohammed Ali and especially of the branch of it to which\r\nTewfik belonged, his father Ismaïl and his grandfather Ibrahim, a cruel\r\nand treacherous race which had brought untold woes upon the fellahin and\r\nhad ruined the country morally and financially, and had, by their\r\nmisconduct, brought about foreign intervention. Secondly, there was the\r\nquestion of reforms. Now that the Press was free, attacks were beginning\r\nto be made upon various gross abuses, the injustice of the taxation\r\nwhich, under the foreign Financial Control, favoured Europeans at the\r\nexpense of the native population; of the unnecessary multiplication of\r\nhighly paid offices held by foreigners, French and English; of the hold\r\nobtained by these over the railway administration and the administration\r\nof the domains which had passed into the hands of representatives of the\r\nRothschilds; of the scandal of £9,000 a year subvention being granted\r\nstill, in spite of the poverty of the land, to the European Opera House\r\nat Cairo. A campaign was being carried on, especially by the \"Taif\"\r\nnewspaper, edited by a hot-headed young man of genius, Abdallah Nadim,\r\nagainst the brothels and wine-shops and disreputable cafés chantants\r\nwhich under protection of the \"Capitulations\" had invaded Cairo to the\r\ngrief and anger of pious Moslems. There was an echo, too, of the\r\nbitterness felt by all Mohammedans just then on account of the French\r\nraid in Tunis where it was affirmed that mosques had been profaned and\r\nMoslem women outraged. Nevertheless the feeling at Cairo between native\r\nChristian and native Mohammedan was altogether friendly. The Copts were\r\nas a rule wholly with the revolution, and their Patriarch was on the\r\nbest of terms with the Ministry of which Butros Pasha was a prominent\r\nand respected member. Even the native Jews with their Chief Rabbi were\r\nall for the Constitutional reform. With the officers the point of\r\nprincipal concern was naturally that of the promised increase of the\r\narmy, which they affirmed was necessary in view of what had taken place\r\nin Tunis, where the Bey had been found quite unprepared with a military\r\nforce sufficient to defend his country. The legal maximum allowed by the\r\nSultan's Firman in Egypt was 18,000 men and the army must be raised to\r\nthat point.\r\n\r\nMy earliest intervention in the affairs of the Nationalists of any\r\nactive kind came about in this way. About the end of November my friend\r\nSheykh Mohammed el Hajrasi informed me of an agitation which was going\r\non among the students of the Azhar, especially those of the Shafeite and\r\nMalekite rites, to depose the actual Sheykh el Islam, or as he is more\r\ngenerally called, Sheykh el Jama, the head of the Hanefite rite,\r\nMohammed el Abbasi. The reason given me for this was that, as a nominee\r\nof the Khedive, he could not be relied on to give an honest _fetwa_\r\n(legal opinion) as to the legality of constitutional government, and\r\nthat it was believed that he would be made use of to refuse a _fetwa_ in\r\nits favour and so give the Khedive an excuse for withdrawing from his\r\nfull promise. The Hanefite rite has always been the Court rite in Egypt,\r\nthe Turkish Viceroys, even since the time of Sultan Selim, having\r\nusurped the privilege of Court appointment, and the Government has\r\nalways named a Hanefite to the supreme religious office. At the same\r\ntime by far the larger number of the students, who amount in all to some\r\n15,000, have been and are of the other two rites, and an attempt was now\r\nto be made in accordance with the revolutionary ideas of the day to\r\nrevert to the more ancient form of nomination, namely by general\r\nelection. He had come, el Hajrasi said, to consult me about this because\r\nthe idea was prevalent that Malet was behind the Khedive in the\r\nsupport he was giving to el Abbasi and in the plan of evading his\r\nconstitutional promise. The difficulty he thought I might be able to\r\nremove, if I went to Malet and used my influence with him in their\r\nfavour. To this I very readily assented, and with the result that I\r\nfound Malet entirely ignorant of the whole matter and quite ready to say\r\nthat the religious disputes of the Ulema were outside his province; and\r\nthat he should interfere on neither side. On the 5th of December,\r\ntherefore, el Abbasi was by vote of the students deposed from his office\r\nand a Sheykh of the Shafeite rite, el Embabeh, named in his place. El\r\nEmbabeh had not been the most popular candidate, for the majority of the\r\nstudents had been for the Malekite el Aleysh, a man of high courage and\r\nreligious authority, who afterwards played a leading part during the war\r\nand died in the first months of the English occupation in prison, it is\r\ngenerally believed poisoned from his outspoken evidence at the time of\r\nArabi's trial. Embabeh, a man altogether his inferior, obtained the vote\r\nonly as the result of a compromise, the Khedive having refused el\r\nAleysh. Four thousand students voted at this election and there were\r\nonly twenty-five dissentients. The little service thus rendered them\r\ngave my friends among the Nationalists confidence in my will and power\r\nto serve them, and they asked me to delay my departure and stay on at\r\nleast some weeks to see them through their farther difficulties. To this\r\nI readily agreed, seeing in the development of a movement so congenial\r\nto my ideas work of the very kind that I was seeking and one in which I\r\ncould be of real use, as interpreter of their perfectly legitimate\r\nambitions, both with Malet at the Agency and at home with Gladstone.\r\n\r\nIn the following few weeks I saw Malet almost daily, and acquired\r\nconsiderable influence over him. Though not unsympathetic towards the\r\nNationalists, I found him very ill informed as to their views and\r\nobjects. He knew none of their leaders personally except Sherif Pasha,\r\nand depended in regard to the general drift of affairs on what Sherif\r\nand the Khedive thought fit to tell him. For what was passing in the\r\nstreet he had nobody on whom he could rely except his Greek dragoman\r\nAranghi who picked up his news at the cafés of the European quarter.\r\nThus he had little means of understanding the situation, nor was\r\nSinkiewicz, his new French colleague, much better informed. Malet was\r\nalso in terrible perplexity as to the real wishes of his own Government.\r\nLord Granville had just written him the well-known despatch of November\r\n4th, in which he had stated in vague terms the sympathy of Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment for reforms in Egypt. But this might mean almost anything,\r\nand was no guide as to the attitude he should observe if any new\r\nconflict should arise between the Khedive and the Nationalists, or\r\nbetween these united and the Financial Controllers. Above all he was in\r\ndoubt as to Mr. Gladstone's mind in the affair of the Constitution. It\r\nwas, therefore, a real relief to him to find in me some one who had a\r\ndefinite policy to suggest, and mine was very clearly that he should\r\nsupport the Nationalists.\r\n\r\nI was able, too, to assure him about Gladstone that he need not doubt\r\nthat when the Prime Minister came to know the facts he _must_ be on the\r\nConstitutional side. I received support, too, with Malet on this point\r\nfrom certain English friends of mine whom I found at Cairo, winter\r\nvisitors, whom I was able to influence to my views. Among these the most\r\nprominent were two ex-Members of the House of Commons, Lord Houghton,\r\nwho in early life had been an enthusiastic advocate of freedom in the\r\nEast, and Sir William Gregory, an old follower of Gladstone's and a\r\nwell-known Liberal. By the middle of December I had succeeded in\r\nbringing round nearly all the English element at Cairo to my view of the\r\ncase. Even Sir Auckland Colvin, the English Financial Controller, who\r\nhad three months before given the Khedive the heroic advice to shoot\r\nArabi, professed himself converted and half inclined to come to terms\r\nwith the revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nGAMBETTA'S POLICY. THE JOINT NOTE\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of December Arabi, who up to this time had been in retirement\r\nat Ras-el-Wady, a military post close to Tel-el-Kebir, arrived at Cairo\r\nand on the 12th for the first time I saw him. He had hired a house close\r\nto his friend Ali Fehmi's, who was now wholly with him, and not far from\r\nthe Abdin Barracks. It was in company, if I remember rightly, with Eïd\r\nDiab, and taking Sabunji with me, that I went to him, it having been\r\narranged beforehand that I should do so by some of our mutual friends.\r\nArabi was at that time at the height of his popularity, being talked of\r\nthrough the length and breadth of Egypt as \"El Wahíd,\" the \"only one,\"\r\nand people were flocking from all sides to Cairo to lay their grievances\r\nbefore him. His outer room was full of suppliants, as was indeed the\r\nentrance from the street, and this was every day the case. He had\r\nalready heard of me as a sympathizer and friend of the fellah cause, and\r\nreceived me with all possible cordiality, especially, he told me, on\r\naccount of what he had also heard, my family connection with Byron,\r\nwhom, though he knew nothing of his poetry, he held in high esteem for\r\nhis work for liberty in Greece. The point is worth noting, as it is very\r\ncharacteristic of Arabi's attitude towards humanity at large without\r\ndistinction of race or creed. There was nothing in him of the fanatic,\r\nif fanaticism means religious hatred, and he was always ready to join\r\nhands in the cause of liberty with Jew, Christian, or infidel,\r\nnotwithstanding his own, by no means lukewarm, piety.\r\n\r\nI talked to him long and without reserve on all the questions of the\r\nday, and found him equally frank and plain spoken. Towards the Khedive\r\nhe expressed his perfect loyalty \"so long as he kept to his promises and\r\nmade no attempt to baulk the Egyptians of their promised freedom.\" But\r\nit was clear that he did not wholly trust him, and considered it his\r\nduty to keep a strict eye over him lest he should swerve from the path.\r\nIn a letter that I wrote soon after, 20th December, to Mr. Gladstone,\r\nwhen I had had several other conversations with him, I said of him: \"The\r\nideas he expresses are not merely a repetition of the phrases of modern\r\nEurope, but are based on a knowledge of history and on the liberal\r\ntradition of Arabian thought, inherited from the days when Mohammedanism\r\nwas liberal. He understands that broader Islam which existed before\r\nMohammed, and the bond of a common worship of the one true God which\r\nunites his own faith with that of Judaism and Christianity. He\r\ndisclaims, I believe, all personal ambition, and there is no kind of\r\ndoubt that the army and country are devoted to him.... Of his own\r\nposition he speaks with modesty. 'I am,' he says, 'the representative of\r\nthe army because circumstances have made the army trust me; but the army\r\nitself is but the representative of the people, its guardian till such\r\ntime as the people shall no longer need it. At present we are the sole\r\nnational force standing between Egypt and its Turkish rulers, who would\r\nrenew at any moment, were they permitted, the iniquities of Ismaïl\r\nPasha. The European Control only partially provides against this, and\r\nmakes no provision whatever by national education in self-government for\r\nthe day when it shall abandon its financial trust. This we have to see\r\nto. We have won for the people their right to speak in an Assembly of\r\nNotables, and we keep the ground to prevent their being cajoled or\r\nfrightened out of it. In this we work not for ourselves but for our\r\nchildren and for those that trust us.... We soldiers are for the moment\r\nin the position of those Arabs who answered the Caliph Omar when, in old\r\nage, he asked the people whether they were satisfied with his rule, and\r\nwhether he had walked straightly in the path of justice. \"O son of El\r\nKhattab,\" said they, \"thou hast indeed walked straightly and we love\r\nthee. But thou knewest that we were at hand and ready, if thou hadst\r\nwalked crookedly, to straighten thee with our swords.\" I trust that no\r\nsuch violence will be needed. As Egyptians we do not love blood, and\r\nhope to shed none; and when our Parliament has learned to speak, our\r\nduty will be over. But until such time we are resolved to maintain the\r\nrights of the people at any cost and we do not fear, with God's help, to\r\njustify our guardianship if need be against all who would silence\r\nthem.'\"\r\n\r\nThis kind of language, so different from that usually used by Eastern\r\npoliticians in their conversations with Europeans, impressed me very\r\ndeeply, and I made a strong mental contrast between Arabi and that other\r\nchampion of liberty whom I had met and talked with at Damascus, Midhat\r\nPasha, altogether in Arabi's favour. Here was no nonsense about\r\nrailroads and canals and tramways as nostrums that could redeem the\r\nEast, but words that went to the root of things and fixed the\r\nresponsibility of good government on the shoulders which alone could\r\nbear it. I felt that even in the incredulous and trifling atmosphere of\r\nthe House of Commons words like these would be listened to--if only they\r\ncould be heard there!\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Sultan and the connection of Egypt with Turkey, Arabi\r\nwas equally explicit. He had no love, he told me, for the Turks who had\r\nmis-governed Egypt for centuries, and he would not hear of interference\r\nfrom Constantinople in the internal affairs of the country. But he made\r\na distinction between the Ottoman Government and the religious authority\r\nof the Sultan, whom, as Emir el Mumenin, he was bound, as long as he\r\nruled justly, to obey and honour. Also the example of Tunis, which the\r\nFrench had first detached from the Empire, and then taken possession of,\r\nshowed how necessary it was to preserve the connection of Egypt with the\r\nHead of the Moslem world. \"We are all,\" he said, \"children of the\r\nSultan, and live together like a family in one house. But, just as in\r\nfamilies, we have, each of us provinces of the Empire, our separate room\r\nwhich is our own to arrange as we will and where even the Sovereign must\r\nnot wantonly intrude. Egypt has gained this independent position through\r\nthe Firmans granted, and we will take care that she preserves it. To ask\r\nfor more than this would be to run a foolish risk, and perhaps lose our\r\nliberty altogether.\"[7] I asked him rather bluntly whether he had been,\r\nas was then currently asserted, in personal communication with\r\nConstantinople, and I noticed that he was reserved in answering and did\r\nso evasively. Doubtless the recollection of his conversation with Ahmed\r\nRatib, of which I then knew nothing, crossed his mind and caused his\r\nhesitation, but he did not allude to it.\r\n\r\nFinally we talked of the relations of Egypt with the Dual Government of\r\nFrance and England. As to this he admitted the good that had been done\r\nby freeing the country of Ismaïl and regularizing the finances, but they\r\nmust not, he said, stand in the way of the National regeneration by\r\nsupporting the Khedive's absolute rule or the old Circassian Pashas\r\nagainst them. He looked to England rather than to France for sympathy in\r\ntheir struggle for freedom, and especially to Mr. Gladstone, who had\r\nshown himself the friend of liberty everywhere--this in response to what\r\nI had explained to him of Gladstone's views--but like everybody else\r\njust then at Cairo he distrusted Malet. I did what I could to ease his\r\nmind on this point, and so we parted. This first interview gave me so\r\nfavourable an opinion of the fellah Colonel that I went immediately to\r\nmy friend, Sheykh Mohammed Abdu, to tell him how he had impressed me,\r\nand suggested that a program, in the sense of what Arabi had told me,\r\nought to be drawn up which I might send to Mr. Gladstone, as I felt\r\ncertain that if he knew the truth as to the National aspirations, in an\r\nauthoritative way, he could not fail to be impressed by it in a sense\r\nfavourable to them. I spoke, too, to Malet on the same subject, and he\r\nagreed that it might do good, and I consequently, in conjunction with\r\nSheykh Mohammed Abdu and others of the civilian leaders, drew up,\r\nSabunji being our scribe, a manifesto embodying succinctly the views of\r\nthe National party. This Mohammed Abdu took to Mahmud Pasha Sami, who\r\nwas once again Minister of War, and gained his adhesion to it, and it\r\nwas also shown to and approved by Arabi. This done I forwarded it, with\r\nMalet's knowledge and approval, to Gladstone, explaining to him the\r\nwhole situation and inviting his sympathy for a movement so very much in\r\naccordance with his avowed principles. \"I cannot understand,\" I said, in\r\nconcluding my letter to Gladstone, \"that these are sentiments to be\r\ndeplored or actions to be crushed by an English Liberal Government. Both\r\nmay be easily guided. And I think the lovers of Western progress should\r\nrather congratulate themselves on this strange and unlooked for sign of\r\npolitical life in a land which has hitherto been reproached by them as\r\nthe least thinking portion of the stagnant East. You, sir, I think,\r\nonce expressed to me your belief that the nations of the East could only\r\nregenerate themselves by a spontaneous resumption of their lost national\r\n_Will_, and behold in Egypt that _Will_ has arisen and is now struggling\r\nto find words which may persuade Europe of its existence.\"\r\n\r\nWhile sending this \"Program of the National Party\" to Gladstone, I also\r\nat the same time, by Sir William Gregory's advice, sent it to the\r\n\"Times.\" Of this course Malet disapproved as he thought it might\r\ncomplicate matters at Constantinople, an idea strongly fixed in his\r\ncautious diplomatic mind. But Gregory insisted that it ought to be\r\npublished, as otherwise it might be pigeon-holed at Downing Street and\r\noverlooked; and I think he was right. Gregory was a personal friend of\r\nthe then excellent editor of the \"Times,\" Chenery, whose services to the\r\nNational cause in Egypt at this date were very great. Chenery was a man\r\nof a large mind on Eastern affairs, being a considerable Arabic scholar,\r\nand had published a most admirable English translation of the\r\n\"Assemblies of Hariri\"; and he was able thus to take a wider view of the\r\nEgyptian question than the common journalistic one that it was a\r\nquestion primarily concerning the London Stock Exchange--this although\r\nhe was himself an Egyptian Bondholder. He consequently gave every\r\nprominence to the letters Gregory and I wrote to him during the next few\r\nmonths in support of the National movement, and to the last, even when\r\nthe war came, continued that favour. In the present instance, indeed,\r\nChenery somewhat overdid his welcome to our program, stating that it had\r\nbeen received from Arabi himself, an inaccuracy which enabled Malet, who\r\nknew the facts, to disown it through Reuter's Agency as an authentic\r\ndocument.\r\n\r\nIt will perhaps be as well to explain here the way in which the London\r\nPress and especially Reuter's News Agency was at this time manipulated\r\nofficially at Cairo and made subservient to the intrigues of diplomacy.\r\nVery few London newspapers had any regular correspondent in Egypt, the\r\n\"Times\" and the \"Pall Mall Gazette\" being, as far as I know, the only\r\ntwo that were thus provided. Both, as far as politics were concerned,\r\nwere practically in the hands of Sir Auckland Colvin, the English\r\nFinancial Controller, an astute Indian official, with the traditions of\r\nIndian diplomacy strongly developed in his political practice. He had\r\nsome experience of journalism, having been connected with the \"Pioneer\"\r\nin India, an Anglo-Indian journal of pronounced imperialistic type with\r\nwhich he was still in correspondence. He was also Morley's regular\r\ncorrespondent in the \"Pall Mall Gazette,\" and had through him the ear of\r\nthe Government. The importance of this unavowed connection will be seen\r\nlater when he made it his business to bring about English intervention.\r\nLastly, on all important diplomatic matters he inspired the \"Times,\"\r\nwhose regular correspondent, Scott, depended on him for his information.\r\nWith regard to Reuter and Havas, the Telegraphic Agencies, both were\r\nheavily subventioned by the Anglo-French Financial Control, receiving\r\n£1,000 a year each, charged on the thin resources of the Egyptian\r\nBudget. Reuter especially was the servant and mouthpiece of the English\r\nAgency, and the telegrams despatched to London were under Malet's\r\ncensorship. This sort of manipulation of the organs of public news in\r\nthe interests of our diplomacy exists in nearly all the capitals where\r\nour agents reside, and is a potent instrument for misleading the home\r\npublic. The influence is not as a rule exercised by any direct payment,\r\nbut by favour given in regard to secret and valuable information, and\r\nalso largely by social amenities. In Egypt it has always within my\r\nknowledge been supreme, except at moments of extreme crisis when the\r\nbody of special Press correspondents at Cairo or Alexandria has been too\r\nnumerous to be kept under official control. In ordinary times our\r\nofficials have had complete authority both as to what news should be\r\nsent to London, and what news, received from London, should be published\r\nin Egypt. It is very necessary that this, the true condition of things,\r\nshould be steadily borne in mind by historians when they consult the\r\nnewspaper files of these years in search of information.\r\n\r\nDown, however, to near the end of the year 1881, except for this small\r\ndifference of opinion, my relations with Malet remained perfectly and\r\nintimately friendly. He made me the confidant of his doubts and\r\ntroubles, his anxiety to follow out the exact wishes of the Foreign\r\nOffice, and his fears lest in so difficult a situation he should do\r\nanything which should not gain an official approval. He professed\r\nhimself, and I think he was, in full sympathy with my view of the\r\nNational case, and he leaned on me as on one able, at any rate, to act\r\nas buffer between him and any new violent trouble while waiting a\r\ndecision in Downing Street as to clear policy. Thus I find a note that\r\non the 19th December I was asked by him and Sir Auckland Colvin, whose\r\nacquaintance I had now made and who affected views hardly less\r\nfavourable than Malet's to the Nationalists, to help them in a\r\ndifficulty they were in about the Army Estimates.\r\n\r\nIt was the time of year when the new Budget was being drafted, and the\r\nNationalist Minister of War, Mahmud Sami, had demanded £600,000 as the\r\namount of the year's estimates for his department. It was an increase of\r\nI forget how many thousand pounds over the estimate of 1881, and was\r\nnecessitated, Mahmud Sami said, by the Khedive's promise of raising the\r\narmy to the full number of men allowed by the Firman, 18,000. The\r\nMinister had explained his insistence on the plea that a refusal would\r\nor might cause a new military demonstration, the bug-bear of those days;\r\nand I was asked to find out what sum the army would really be satisfied\r\nwith for their estimates. Colvin authorized me to go as far as £522,000,\r\nand to tell Arabi and the officers that it was financially impossible to\r\ngive more. He had no objection, he said, to the army's being increased\r\nso long as the estimates were not exceeded. He thought, however, the sum\r\nproposed would suffice for an increase up to 15,000 men. I consequently\r\nwent to Arabi and argued the matter with him and others of the officers;\r\nand persuaded them, on my assurance that Colvin's word could be trusted,\r\nto withdraw all further objection. They said they would accept the\r\nincreased sum of £522,000 as sufficient, and make it go as far in the\r\nincrease of soldiers as it could. They meant to economize, they said, in\r\nother ways, and hoped to get their full complement of men out of the\r\nbalance. They promised me, too, on this occasion to have patience and\r\nmake no further armed demonstrations, a promise which to the end they\r\nfaithfully fulfilled. Arabi's last words to me on this occasion were\r\n\"_men sabber dhaffer_,\" \"he who has patience conquers.\" I sent a note\r\nthe same day to Colvin informing him of the result, and I was also\r\nthanked by Malet for having helped them both out of a considerable\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nNevertheless Malet, about a week later, surprised me one afternoon, 28th\r\nDecember, when I had been playing lawn tennis with him, as I often did\r\nat the Agency, by showing me the draft of a despatch he had just sent to\r\nthe Foreign Office mentioning my visit to Egypt and the encouragement I\r\nhad given to the Nationalists, and without mentioning what I had done to\r\nhelp him, complaining only of my having sent the Program against his\r\nwishes to the \"Times.\" As we had up to that moment been acting in\r\nperfect cordiality together, and nothing whatever had occurred beyond\r\nthe publication of the manifesto, I took him pretty roundly to task for\r\nhis ill faith in concealing my other services rendered to his diplomacy,\r\nand insisted that he should cancel this misleading despatch, and with\r\nsuch energy that he wrote in my presence a cancelling telegram, and also\r\na second despatch repairing in some measure the injustice he had done\r\nme. I have never quite understood what Malet's motive was in this\r\ncurious manoeuvre. I took it at the time to be a passing fit of\r\njealousy, a dislike to the idea that it should be known at the Foreign\r\nOffice that he owed anything to me in the comparatively good relations\r\nhe had succeeded in establishing with the Nationalists; but on\r\nreflection I have come to the conclusion, as one more in accordance with\r\nhis cautious character, that he was merely guarding himself officially\r\nagainst public responsibility of any kind being fixed on him for my\r\nNationalist views, should these be condemned in Downing Street. It is\r\nthe more likely explanation because his private conscience evidently\r\npricked him about it to the extent of avowing to me what he had\r\nofficially done. The insincerity, however, though repented of, was a\r\nwarning to me which I did not forget, and while I continued for some\r\nweeks more to go to the Agency it was always with a feeling of possible\r\nbetrayal at Malet's hands. I was ready, nevertheless, to help him,\r\nand it was not long before he was again obliged, by the extreme\r\ncircumstances of his political isolation at Cairo, to resort to my good\r\noffices, and, finding himself in flood water altogether beyond his\r\ndepth, to send me once more as his messenger of peace to Arabi and the\r\nother Nationalist leaders.\r\n\r\nAll had gone well so far, as far as any of us knew, in the political\r\nsituation at Cairo down to the end of the year, and during the first\r\nweek of the new year, 1882. There was a good understanding now between\r\nall parties in Egypt, the army was quiescent, the Press was moderate\r\nunder Mohammed Abdu's popular censorship, and the Nationalist Ministers,\r\nundisturbed by menace from any quarter, were preparing the draft of the\r\nOrganic Law which was to give the country its civil liberties. On the\r\n26th of December, the Chamber of Delegates summoned to discuss the\r\narticles of the promised Constitution had met at Cairo, and had been\r\nopened formally with a reassuring speech by the Khedive in person, whose\r\nattitude was so changed for the better towards the popular movement that\r\nMalet was able, on the 2nd of January, to write home to Lord Granville:\r\n\"I found His Highness, for the first time since my return in September,\r\ncheerful in mood and taking a hopeful view of the situation. The change\r\nwas very noticeable. His Highness appears to have frankly accepted the\r\nsituation.\" Arabi had ceased to busy himself personally with the redress\r\nof grievances, and it had been arranged with the approval of the French\r\nand English agents that Arabi should, as they expressed it, \"regularize\"\r\nhis position and accept the responsibility of his acknowledged political\r\ninfluence by taking office as Under-Secretary at the War Office. This it\r\nhad been thought would be putting the dangerous free lance in uniform\r\nand securing him to the cause of order.\r\n\r\nThe only doubtful point was now the attitude of the Deputies in regard\r\nto the details of the Constitution they had been assembled to discuss;\r\nand the majority of them, as were my reforming friends at the Azhar,\r\nseemed disposed to moderation. \"We have waited,\" said Sheykh Mohammed\r\nAbdu, \"so many hundred years for our freedom that we can well afford now\r\nto wait some months.\" Certainly at that date Malet and Colvin, and I\r\nthink also Sinkiewicz, were favourably disposed to the claim of the\r\nNationalists to have a true Parliament. They had begun to see that it\r\nwas the universal national desire, and would act as a safety-valve for\r\nideas more dangerous. A frank public declaration of goodwill at that\r\nmoment on the part of the English and French Governments towards the\r\npopular hopes would have secured a workable arrangement between the\r\nNationalist Government and the Dual Control, which would have\r\nsafeguarded the bondholders' interests no less than it would have\r\nsecured to Egypt its liberty. Nor did we think that this would be long\r\ndelayed.\r\n\r\nOn the first day of the New Year the National Program I had sent to Mr.\r\nGladstone was published in the \"Times,\" with a leading article and\r\napproving comments, and in spite of Malet's prognostication of evil had\r\nbeen well received in Europe, and even at Constantinople where it had\r\ndrawn down no kind of thunderbolt. Its tone was so studiously moderate,\r\nand its reasoning so frank and logical that it seemed impossible the\r\nposition in Egypt should any longer be misunderstood. Especially in\r\nEngland, with an immense Liberal majority in the House of Commons, and\r\nMr. Gladstone at the head of affairs, it was almost inconceivable that\r\nit should not be met in a friendly spirit--quite inconceivable to us who\r\nwere waiting anxiously for Gladstone's answer at Cairo, that at that\r\nvery moment the English Foreign Office should be proceeding to acts of\r\nmenace and the language of armed intervention. Unfortunately, however,\r\nthough none of us, not even Malet, at the time knew it, the decision,\r\nadverse to the Egyptian hopes, had already been half taken. The program\r\nreached Mr. Gladstone, as nearly as I can calculate it, a fortnight too\r\nlate. We were all expecting a message of peace, when, like thunder in a\r\nclear sky, the ill-omened Joint Note of January 6th, 1882, was launched\r\nupon us. It upset all our hopes and calculations and threw back Egypt\r\nonce more into a sea of troubles.\r\n\r\nIt is right that the genesis of this most mischievous document, to which\r\nis directly due the whole of the misfortunes during the year, with the\r\nloss to Egypt of her liberty, to Mr. Gladstone of his honour, and to\r\nFrance of her secular position of influence on the Nile, should be truly\r\ntold. Something regarding it may be learned from the published\r\ndocuments, both French and English, but only indirectly, and not all;\r\nand I am perhaps the only person not officially concerned in its\r\ndrafting who am in a position to put all the dots with any precision on\r\nthe i's. In Egypt it has not unnaturally been supposed that, because in\r\nthe event it turned to the advantage of English aggression, it was\r\ntherefore an instrument forged for its own purposes at our Foreign\r\nOffice, but in reality the reverse is true and the note was drafted not\r\nin Downing Street but at the Quai d'Orsay, and in the interests, so far\r\nas these were political--for they were also financial--of French\r\nambition.\r\n\r\nI have told already how I travelled with Sir Charles Dilke from London\r\nto Paris, and of our conversation on the way and of the impression left\r\non me by it that he would \"sell Egypt for his Commercial Treaty\"; and\r\nthis is precisely what in fact had happened. The dates as far as I can\r\nfix them were these: On the 15th of November St. Hilaire had gone out of\r\noffice, and had been succeeded by Gambetta, who found himself faced with\r\na general Mohammedan revolt against the French Government in Tunis and\r\nAlgeria. He was alarmed at the Pan-Islamic character it was taking, and\r\nattributed it largely to the Sultan Abdul Hamid's propaganda, and he\r\nthought he saw the same influence at work in the National movement in\r\nEgypt, as well as the intrigues of Ismaïl, Halim, and others. France had\r\nbeen traditionally hostile to the sovereign claims of the Porte in North\r\nAfrica, and Gambetta came into office determined to thwart and deal with\r\nthem by vigorous measures. He was besides, through his Jewish origin,\r\nclosely connected with the _haute finance_ of the Paris Bourse, and was\r\nintimate with the Rothschilds and other capitalists, who had their\r\nmillions invested in Egyptian Bonds. Nubar Pasha and Rivers Wilson were\r\nthen both living at Paris, and his close friends and advisers in regard\r\nto Egyptian matters, and it was from them that he took his view of the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nHe had, therefore, not been more than a few days in office before he\r\nentered into communication with our Foreign Office, with the object of\r\ngetting England to join him in vigorous action against the National\r\nmovement, as a crusade of civilization and a support to the established\r\norder at Cairo of Financial things. In London at the same time there was\r\na strong desire to get the Commercial Treaty, which was about to expire,\r\nrenewed with France as speedily as possible, and advantage was taken at\r\nthe Foreign Office of Sir Charles Dilke's personal intimacy with the new\r\nFrench Premier to get the negotiation for it finished. A commission for\r\nthis purpose, of which Dilke and Wilson were the two English members,\r\nhad been sitting at Paris since the month of May, and so far without\r\nresult. Dilke's visit to Paris was in connection with both matters, and\r\nwas resolved on within a week of Gambetta's accession to power.\r\nReference to newspapers of that date, November 1881, will show that the\r\nnegotiations between the two Governments about the Commercial Treaty\r\nwere just then in a highly critical state, and it was even reported that\r\nthey had been broken off. Dilke's presence, however, gave them new life,\r\nor at least prevented their demise. Between the 22nd of November and the\r\n15th of December he passed to and fro between the two capitals; and at\r\nthe latter date we find Gambetta (Blue Book Egypt 5, 1882, page 21)\r\napproaching Lord Lyons, our Ambassador at Paris, with a proposal to take\r\ncommon action in Egypt. He considers it to be \"extremely important to\r\nstrengthen the authority of Tewfik Pasha; every endeavour should be made\r\nto inspire him with confidence in the support of France and England, and\r\nto infuse into him firmness and energy. The adherents of Ismaïl and\r\nHalim and the Egyptians generally should be made to understand that\r\nFrance and England would not acquiesce in his being deposed.... It would\r\nbe advisable to cut short the intrigues of Constantinople,\" etc. This\r\nlanguage is communicated by Lord Lyons to the Foreign Office, and on the\r\n19th Lord Granville \"agrees in thinking that the time has come when the\r\ntwo Governments should consider what course had better be adopted,\" etc.\r\nThus encouraged, Gambetta on the 24th proposes to take occasion of the\r\nmeeting of the Egyptian Notables to make \"a distinct manifestation of\r\nunion between France and England so as to strengthen the position of\r\nTewfik Pasha and discourage the promoters of disorder.\" The Egyptian\r\nChamber meets on the 26th, and on the 28th Dilke, who has returned the\r\nday before to Paris, has a long conversation with Gambetta about the\r\nTreaty of Commerce (\"Times\"), while on precisely the same day Lord\r\nGranville agrees to give \"assurance to Tewfik Pasha of the sympathy and\r\nsupport of France and England, and to encourage His Highness to maintain\r\nand assert his proper authority.\"\r\n\r\nThis identity of date alone suffices to fix the connection between the\r\ntwo negotiations, and shows the precise moment at which the fatal\r\nagreement was come to, and that my communication of the National Program\r\nto Gladstone, which was posted on the 20th, must have been just too late\r\nto prevent the disaster. Letters then took a week to reach London, and\r\nGladstone was away for the Christmas holidays, and cannot have had\r\ntime, however much he may have been inclined to do so, to forward it on\r\nto the Foreign Office. Our Government thus committed to Gambetta's\r\npolicy, Gambetta on the 31st (Blue Book Egypt 5, 1882) presents to Lyons\r\nthe draft, drawn up with his own hand, of the Joint Note to be\r\ndespatched to Cairo in the sense of his previous communication of the\r\n24th--and, be it noted, on the same day negotiations for a renewal of\r\nthe Commercial Treaty are announced as formally renewed. On the 1st of\r\nJanuary the Paris correspondent of the \"Times\" sends a précis of the\r\nJoint Note to London, explaining that he only now forwards it, having\r\nbeen instructed by M. Gambetta only to divulge it \"at the proper\r\nmoment.\" This is understood to mean the final success of Dilke's\r\ncommercial mission, and the following day, 2nd January, he returns to\r\nLondon. I trace, nevertheless, the influence of my appeal to Gladstone\r\nin the delay of five days, still made by Granville before he unwillingly\r\nsigns the Note, and the reservation he stipulates for on the part of Her\r\nMajesty's Government that \"Her Majesty's Government must not be\r\nconsidered as committing themselves thereby to any particular mode of\r\naction,\" a postscript typical of Granville's character, and, as I think\r\ntoo, of a conflict in ideas, afterwards very noticeable, between the\r\nForeign Office, pushed on by Dilke, and Gladstone as Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nSuch is the evidence which, intelligently read, can be gathered from the\r\npublished documents of the day. I have, however, a letter from Sir\r\nRivers Wilson dated a few days later, 13th January, in answer to one of\r\nmine, which explains in a few words the whole situation. \"I am above all\r\npleased,\" he writes, \"at the interest you are taking in Egyptian\r\npolitics. You confirm what I believe to be the case in two particulars\r\nat least, viz., that the soldiers express the feeling of the population,\r\nand that Tewfik has been working with the Sultan. As regards the latter\r\ncircumstance I must say there is nothing surprising in it. Six weeks ago\r\nGambetta said to me, 'Le Khedive est aux genoux du Sultan.' But the\r\nreason is plain. Tewfik is weak and cowardly. His army is against him.\r\nThe Harems hate him. He found no support there where he naturally might\r\nhave looked for it, viz., at the hands of the English and French\r\nGovernments, and so he turned to the only quarter where sympathy and\r\nperhaps material assistance were forthcoming. It was to remedy this\r\nstate of things that the idea of the Joint Declaration was conceived,\r\nwhatever gloss or subsequent explanation may be now put forward, and I\r\nshall be disappointed if it does not produce the desired effect and\r\ncause the officers, Ulemas, and Notables to understand that renewed\r\ndisturbance means armed intervention in Europe. Our Government may not\r\nlike it, but they are bound now by formal engagement to France and\r\ncannot withdraw.\"\r\n\r\nThis letter, coming from Wilson at Paris, holding the official position\r\nthere he did, and being, as he was, on intimate terms both with Dilke\r\nand Gambetta, is a document of the highest historical importance, and\r\nfixes beyond the possibility of doubt on the French Government the\r\ninitiative in the designed intervention, though the Yellow Books also\r\nare not altogether silent. These, though most defective in their\r\ninformation, do not hide Gambetta's initial responsibility. I heard at\r\nthe time, and I believe that the form of joint intervention he designed\r\nfor Egypt was that England should demonstrate with a fleet at Alexandria\r\nwhile France should land troops. Had that come to pass we cannot doubt\r\nthat French influence would now be supreme in Egypt. It was only\r\nfrustrated that winter by the accident of Gambetta's unlooked-for fall\r\nfrom power by an adverse vote on some domestic matter in the Chamber at\r\nthe end of the month, for Gladstone at that time was far too averse from\r\nviolent measures to have sent an English fleet with a French army, and\r\nthe landing of troops would have been certainly needed.\r\n\r\nThere is more than one moral to be drawn from this historic episode, and\r\nthe most instructive is, perhaps, the fact that neither of the two\r\nMinisters, with all their cleverness and in spite of their apparent\r\nsuccess each in his own scheme, really effected his purpose. Gambetta\r\nand Granville in the first weeks of January doubtless plumed themselves\r\non having gained an important object and strengthened the friendly link\r\nbetween their two Governments by a common agreement. Gambetta had got\r\nhis note, Granville his treaty. But neither rogue was really able to\r\nbring home his booty. Gambetta, though he exerted all his influence with\r\nthe Chamber to get the Commercial Treaty with England renewed, failed to\r\nobtain a majority and the treaty lapsed, and with it the Liberal\r\nargument that Free Trade was not isolating England. On the other hand,\r\nthough he had got Granville unwillingly to sign the Note, which he\r\nintended to use for the glory of France, Gambetta found that he had\r\nforged a weapon which he could not himself wield and which within six\r\nmonths passed into his rival's hand, while the friendly arrangement\r\nproved almost as soon as it was come to, to be the destruction of all\r\ncordial feeling between the two nations for close on a generation.\r\nPersonally, in the disappointment of the two intriguers and the rival\r\ninterest of the two nations, I am able to hold a detached attitude. What\r\nseems to me tragic in the matter is that for the sake of their paltry\r\nambitions and paltrier greeds a great national hope was wrecked, and the\r\ncause of reform for a great religion postponed for many years. The\r\nopportunity of good thrown away by the two statesmen between them can\r\nhardly recur again in another half century.\r\n\r\nThe effect of Gambetta's menace to the National Party was disastrous at\r\nCairo to the cause of peace. I was with Malet soon after the note\r\narrived, and he gave it me to read and asked me what I thought of it. I\r\nsaid: \"They will take it as a declaration of war.\" He answered: \"It is\r\nnot meant in a hostile sense,\" and explained to me how it might be\r\ninterpreted in a way favourable to the National hopes. He asked me to go\r\nto the Kasr el Nil and persuade Arabi, who had just been made\r\nUnder-Secretary of War, to accept it thus, authorizing me to say, \"that\r\nthe meaning of the Note as understood by the British Government was that\r\nthe English Government would not permit any interference of the Sultan\r\nwith Egypt, and would also not allow the Khedive to go back from his\r\npromises or molest the Parliament.\" He also told me, though he did not\r\nauthorize me to repeat this on his authority, that he hoped to get leave\r\nto add to the Note a written explanation in the sense just given. I know\r\nthat he telegraphed repeatedly for some such permission, and that he\r\nwrote strongly condemning the note as impolitic and dangerous. Not a\r\nword, however, of these important protests and requests is to be found\r\nin the Blue Books, though the Blue Books show that Lord Granville must\r\nhave paid attention to them to the extent of expressing himself willing\r\nto give some such explanation of the Note but being prevented from doing\r\nso by Gambetta. Sinkiewicz seems also to have asked his Government to\r\nbe allowed to explain the Note, but was forbidden. Sir Auckland Colvin,\r\ntoo, condemned the Note in conversation with me quite as strongly as\r\nMalet had done.\r\n\r\nI went accordingly to the Kasr el Nil about noon on the 9th (the text of\r\nthe Note had reached us on the 8th) and found Arabi alone in his\r\nofficial room. For the first and only time I have seen him so, he was\r\nangry. His face was like a thundercloud, and there was a peculiar gleam\r\nin his eye. He had seen the text of the Note though it had not been\r\npublished--indeed, it had only as yet been telegraphed--and I asked him\r\nhow he understood it. \"Tell me, rather,\" he said, \"how you understand\r\nit.\" I then delivered my message. He said: \"Sir Edward Malet must really\r\nthink us children who do not know the meaning of words.\" \"In the first\r\nplace,\" he said, \"it is the language of menace. There is no clerk in\r\nthis office who would use such words with such a meaning.\" He alluded to\r\nthe reference to the Notables made in the first paragraph of the Note.\r\n\"That,\" he said, \"is a menace to our liberties.\" Next, the declaration\r\nthat French and English policy were one meant that, as France had\r\ninvaded Tunis, so England would invade Egypt. \"Let them come,\" he said,\r\n\"every man and child in Egypt will fight them. It is contrary to our\r\nprinciples to strike the first blow, but we shall know how to return\r\nit.\" Lastly, as to the guarantee of Tewfik Pasha's throne. \"The throne,\"\r\nhe said, \"if there is one, is the Sultan's. The Khedive needs no foreign\r\nguarantees. You may tell me what you will, but I know the meaning of\r\nwords better than Mr. Malet does.\" In truth, Malet's explanation was\r\nnonsense, and I felt a fool before Arabi and ashamed of having made\r\nmyself the bearer of such rubbish. But I assured him I had delivered the\r\nmessage as Sir Edward had given it me. \"He asks you to believe it,\" I\r\nsaid, \"and I ask you to believe him.\" At leaving he softened, took me by\r\nthe arm to lead me down and invited me still to come as before to his\r\nhouse. I said: \"I shall only come back when I have better news for you,\"\r\nby which I intended to hint at a possible explanation of the Note such\r\nas Malet had telegraphed for permission to give. None however came. Nor\r\ndid I see Arabi again till more than three weeks later, when a letter\r\nfrom Mr. Gladstone reached me which I interpreted in a more hopeful\r\nsense and which caused us great rejoicing.\r\n\r\nOn returning to the Residency, Malet asked me how I had fared. \"They are\r\nirreconcilable now,\" I answered. \"The Note has thrown them into the arms\r\nof the Sultan.\" Such indeed was the effect, and not with the soldiers\r\nalone, but as soon as the Note was published with all sections of the\r\nNational Party, even with the Khedive. Gambetta, if he had expected to\r\nstrengthen Tewfik's hands, had missed his mark entirely. The timid\r\nKhedive was only frightened, and the Nationalists, instead of being\r\nfrightened, were enraged. The Egyptians for the first time found\r\nthemselves quite united. Sheykh Mohammed Abdu and the cautious Azhar\r\nreformers from that point threw in their lot wholly with the advanced\r\nparty. All, even the Circassians, resented the threat of foreign\r\nintervention, and on the other hand the most anti-Turkish of the\r\nNationalists, such as my friend Hajrasi, saw that Arabi had been right\r\nin secretly leaning upon the Sultan. Arabi thus gained immensely in\r\npopularity and respect, and for many days after this I hardly heard\r\nanything from my Egyptian friends but the language of Pan-Islamism. It\r\nwas a Roustan[8] policy over again, they said.\r\n\r\nI did my best to smooth down matters with them till the explanation\r\nshould arrive which Malet had promised us; but I found my efforts\r\nuseless. It was an alarming three weeks for us all, from the delivery of\r\nthe Note till Gambetta's fall. News came that a French force was being\r\nassembled for embarkation at Toulon, and that was the form of\r\nintervention generally expected. Indeed, I think it is not too much to\r\nsay that Gambetta's resignation on 31st January alone saved Egypt from\r\nthe misfortune, even greater perhaps than what afterwards befell her, of\r\na French invasion avowedly anti-Mohammedan and in purely European\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[7] Sir William Gregory, who saw Arabi about the same date as I did, has\r\nrecorded in the \"Times\" very similar language as used by him.\r\n\r\n[8] Roustan was the French diplomatist at Tunis who had engineered the\r\nFrench designs on the Regency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nFALL OF SHERIF PASHA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe political crisis at Cairo, by the middle of January, was evidently\r\napproaching fast. Indeed it had become inevitable. The publication of\r\nthe Joint Note happened to coincide with the drafting of the new _Leyha_\r\nor Organic Law, which was to define the power of the Representative\r\nChamber in the promised Parliament. In regard to this, the Financial\r\nControllers had been insisting with the Ministry that the power they had\r\nbeen exercising for the last two years of drawing up the yearly Budget,\r\naccording to their own view of the economic requirements of the country,\r\nshould remain intact, that is to say, that it should not be subject to\r\ndiscussion or a vote in the Chamber; and to this Sherif Pasha had\r\nagreed, and had already drafted his project of law without assigning to\r\nthe Chamber any right in money matters. The majority of the delegates,\r\nhowever, were not unnaturally dissatisfied at this, arguing that the\r\nForeign Financial Control, having its sole status in the country as\r\nguardian of the foreign obligations, and as the interest on the debt\r\namounted only to one-half of the revenue, the remaining half ought to be\r\nat the disposal of the nation.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there is no reason to suppose that the point would not\r\nhave been conceded by them, especially as Sultan Pasha, who had been\r\nnamed their President, was with Sherif in considering it prudent to\r\nyield, had things remained during the month as they were at the\r\nbeginning. It has been seen how readily the War Office had come to terms\r\nwith the Controllers in the matter of the Army Estimates. Now, however,\r\nunder the menace of the Note, the Notables were no longer in a mood of\r\nconciliation, and met Sherif's draft with a counterdraft of their own,\r\nadding a number of new articles to the Leyha, largely extending the\r\nParliamentary powers, and subjecting the half of the Budget not\r\naffected to the interest of the debt to vote by the Chamber. This\r\nbrought the Controllers into active conflict with them, M. de Blignières\r\ntaking the lead in it and bringing Colvin into line with him. The\r\nControllers declared it absolutely necessary that the Budget should\r\nremain whole and undivided in their hands, and denounced the\r\ncounter-draft as being a project, not of a Parliament, but of a\r\n\"Convention.\" The phrase, founded on memories of the French Revolution,\r\nwas doubtless de Blignières', but it was adopted by Colvin, and pressed\r\nby him on Malet. The dispute was a serious one, and might lead to just\r\nsuch mischief as Malet feared, and give excuse to the French Government\r\nfor the intervention it was seeking. Sherif having already committed\r\nhimself to the Controllers' view, was being persuaded by them to stand\r\nfirm, and the Khedive's attitude was doubtful. A quarrel between the\r\nKhedive and his Parliament on a financial question involving European\r\nbondholding interests was just such a case as the French Government--for\r\nGambetta was still in office--might be expected to take advantage of for\r\nharm.\r\n\r\nIn this emergency Malet--and Colvin, who though he wished to get his way\r\nas Financial Controller had no mind for French intervention--joined in\r\nasking me yet once again to help them, and to make a last effort to\r\ninduce the extreme party among the Notables to yield something of their\r\npretensions, and after consultation with Sheykh Mohammed Abdu, who as\r\nusual was for prudence and conciliation, it was arranged that I should\r\nhave a private conference at his house with a deputation from them, and\r\nargue the case with them, and show them the probable consequences of\r\ntheir resistance--namely, armed intervention. Accordingly, I got up the\r\ncase of the Controllers with Colvin, and drew up with Malet the\r\ndifferent points of the argument I was to use. These I have by me in a\r\npaper headed, \"Notes of what I have to say to the Members of the\r\nEgyptian Parliament, 17th January, 1882.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to this my instructions were to represent to the Members of\r\nthe Deputation that the existing procedure respecting the Budget was an\r\ninternational affair, which neither Sherif nor the Parliament had any\r\nright to touch without gaining the consent of the two controlling\r\nGovernments. I was to recite the history of the Control's establishment,\r\nand show them a private Note which had been appended by Malet and Monge\r\n(the French Consul-General), 15th November, 1879, to the Decree\r\ninstituting it. I was to invite the members to consider whether\r\nan alteration in the form of determining the Budget was not an\r\ninternational matter, and, as such, outside the sphere of their action.\r\nThey had admitted that international matters must be left untouched by\r\nthem. The control of the Budget was an international matter. Therefore\r\nit should be left untouched by them. I was, however, authorized by\r\nColvin to say that personally he had no objection to a slight\r\nmodification of the present arrangement, such as should give the\r\nParliament a consultative voice which might later become a right of\r\nvoting. Should they accept such a compromise, Malet would represent the\r\nmatter favourably to his Government, though he had no authority to\r\npromise its acceptance by France or England. All other differences with\r\nSherif they must settle with him themselves, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nOn this basis, with Sabunji's help and Mohammed Abdu's, I argued the\r\ncase thoroughly with them, and convinced myself that there was no\r\npossibility of their yielding. They agreed, indeed, to modify three or\r\nfour of the articles which the Controllers had principally objected to\r\nas giving the Chamber powers of a \"Convention,\" and the amendments I\r\nproposed in these were in fact incorporated later in the published\r\nLeyha. But on the Article of the Budget they were quite obdurate,\r\nnotwithstanding the support Sheykh Mohammed Abdu gave me. They would not\r\nyield a line of it, and I returned crestfallen to report my failure, nor\r\ndid I again undertake any mission of mediation between Malet and the\r\nNationalists. I had done my best to help him to a peaceful solution of\r\nhis difficulties, but our points of view from this time forth became too\r\ndivergent for me any longer to be able to work with him. Although I had\r\ndone my very best to persuade the Notables to give way--for I was then\r\nfirmly convinced that they were menaced with intervention--I could not\r\nhelp in my inner mind agreeing with them in their claim of controlling\r\nthe free half of the Budget as a sound one, if Parliamentary Government\r\nwas to be a reality for them, not a sham. Malet's despatches of the time\r\nshow that they were all of one mind on this point, and even Sultan\r\nPasha, who was a timid man and easily frightened, declared roundly that\r\nSherif's draft was \"like a drum; it made a great sound but was hollow\r\ninside.\" As between Sherif and the Notables in the quarrel which\r\nfollowed, my anti-Turkish sympathies put me on their side rather than on\r\nhis. At Malet's suggestion I had a little before called on Sherif and\r\nhad discussed the matter with him, and had been unfavourably impressed.\r\n\r\nSherif was a Europeanized Turk of good breeding and excellent manners,\r\nbut with all that arrogant contempt of the fellahin which distinguished\r\nhis class in Egypt. Malet had a high opinion of him because he was a\r\ngood French scholar and so was easy to deal with in the ordinary\r\ndiplomatic way, but to me he showed himself for this very reason in\r\ndisagreeable contrast with the sincere and high-minded men who were the\r\nreal backbone of the National movement, and for whom he expressed\r\nnothing but the superior scorn of a fine French gentleman. He was\r\ncheerfully convinced of his own fitness to govern them and of their\r\nincapacity. \"The Egyptians,\" he told me, \"are children and must be\r\ntreated like children. I have offered them a Constitution which is good\r\nenough for them, and if they are not content with it they must do\r\nwithout one. It was I who created the National Party, and they will find\r\nthat they cannot get on without me. These peasants want guidance.\" When,\r\ntherefore, a fortnight later the quarrel became an open one between him\r\nand them I had no difficulty in deciding which way my sympathies lay.\r\n\r\nI was no longer at Cairo when the news of Sherif's resignation on the\r\n2nd of February reached me. The failure of my negotiation, just\r\ndescribed, with the Notables, had depressed my spirits. I felt that by\r\nundertaking it I had risked much of my popularity with my European\r\nfriends, and that they perhaps distrusted me for the pains I had taken\r\nto convince them against a course on which their hearts were set; and I\r\nhad retired to a distance from the conflict which I could no longer\r\ncontrol or help in to any good purpose. While living at the Hôtel du Nil\r\nduring the winter I had all the time had a camp with tents and camels\r\nand attendant Arabs, pitched outside the city, to which I had\r\noccasionally gone, and now I retired to it altogether. The camp was\r\npitched on the desert land between Koubba Palace and Matarieh, then a\r\nwholly desert region at a point now called Zeitoun, where there were the\r\ninsignificant ruins of what had once been a _shaduf_, the sole sign of\r\nhuman habitation. Here we were completely alone, except that at the\r\ndistance of a mile there was another camp, that of Prince Ahmed, outside\r\nMaterieh. There was no communication then by any form of public\r\nconveyance with Cairo, and when at rare intervals we went in, we rode\r\nour camels to a point between Abbassiyeh and Faggalah where donkeys were\r\nto be hired. There was not a single house on the sands beyond Abbassiyeh\r\nto the north-east. For a moment thus I was able to forget politics and\r\nto enjoy what I have always loved best, life in the open air. I had,\r\nhowever, rendered a last service to my friends by writing a warm defence\r\nof the Egyptian National policy in the \"Times.\" To this I was urged by\r\nmy friend, Sir William Gregory, who had himself sent more than one\r\npowerful letter in the same sense to what was then emphatically the\r\nleading journal of Europe.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly possible to exaggerate the importance a letter on any\r\nsubject had in those days when published by the \"Times,\" and the\r\ncertainty there was, if it was on any political question, of its being\r\nread by the statesmen concerned and treated with full attention. Nor is\r\nit, perhaps, too much to say that Gregory's letters and mine, especially\r\nhis, were largely the means of obtaining a respite for Egypt from the\r\ndangers that threatened her. As they came back to Cairo and were\r\nreproduced in Arabic by the native Press, our Egyptian friends were\r\nreassured about us and their confidence in me revived. It was at the\r\nexpense, however, of Malet's goodwill. Like all diplomatists he hated\r\npublicity, and he was angry with us both because we, who had both been\r\nin the Government service, had appealed as it were over the head of the\r\nForeign Office and his own to the Press. With the regular Press\r\ncorrespondents he knew how to deal, but he could not deal with us who\r\nwere independent writers, or exercise the smallest censorship on our\r\nopinions. There was an end therefore to the close intimacy I had, up to\r\nthat point, in spite of small disagreements, had with the Agency. This\r\nwas unfortunate, as it threw Malet, who always needed to lean on some\r\none stronger than himself, into other and less conciliatory hands.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of January, the very day of the change of Ministry at Paris,\r\nI find a note to the effect that I went in to Cairo and saw Colvin and\r\nhad a remarkable conversation with him. This has become of great\r\nhistorical importance through subsequent events, for it marks the date\r\nwithin a few days of the change of the temper of the English Financial\r\nControl, and with it of our diplomacy towards Egyptian Nationalism, and\r\nalso fixes upon Colvin, what is indeed his due, the chief responsibility\r\nof the rupture which afterwards through his contriving came about. I\r\nhave already said something of Sir Auckland Colvin's character. He was a\r\ntypical Anglo-Indian official, strong, self-reliant, hard, with the\r\ntradition of methods long practised in India, but which were still new\r\nto our European diplomacy, endowed with just enough sympathy with\r\nOriental character to make use of it, without loving it, for English\r\npurposes; but cold in manner and unattractive. I had at an earlier stage\r\nof affairs taken Sheykh Mohammed Abdu to call on him, thinking to bring\r\nabout a _rapprochement_, and I had also tried to do the same with the\r\nofficers. But his manner had repelled the Sheykh, and the officers had\r\nbeen too shy to come with me. He was sometimes astonishingly frank in\r\nspeech. I remember his telling me, on one occasion, when we were talking\r\nof Eastern duplicity, that it was a mistake to suppose that in this\r\nOrientals were our masters. An Englishman who knew the game, he said,\r\ncould always beat them at their own weapons, and they were mere children\r\nin deceit when it came to a contest with us.\r\n\r\nIn the present instance he was more than usually outspoken. The quarrel\r\nbetween the Notables and Sherif was at its acutest stage; and I asked\r\nhim what he thought of the situation. He said he considered it most\r\ngrave. It was evident that the Nationalists were resolved upon the fall\r\nof Sherif, and, if they succeeded, he (Colvin) would have no more to do\r\nwith them. He told me he had completely changed his mind about them. He\r\nhad thought them amenable to reason, but he found them quite\r\nimpracticable, and he would do his best to ruin them if ever they came\r\ninto office. I asked him how he proposed to do this, or stop a movement\r\nwhich he had so lately approved, but which had gone quite beyond his or\r\nanybody's control--how, except by that very intervention we had all\r\nalong been trying to avoid. He said he had changed his mind about\r\nintervention too; that he believed it now to be necessary and\r\ninevitable, and that he would spare no pains to bring it about. I\r\nexpostulated with him, urging that intervention meant only war and war\r\nmeant only annexation. He said he quite understood it in that sense. The\r\nsame thing had been seen over and over again in India. England would\r\nnever give up the footing she had got in Egypt, and it was useless to\r\ntalk about the abstract rights and wrongs of the Egyptians. These would\r\nnot be considered. He repeated what he had said about ruining the\r\nNational Party, and added that he had made no secret of his view. He\r\nshould work for intervention and, if it must be so, for annexation. I am\r\nquite sure I am not mis-quoting this conversation in any essential\r\nfeature. It was not merely half a dozen words spoken in haste, but an\r\nargument which lasted half an hour; and it affected me so strongly that\r\nI decided to warn my Egyptian friends, to whom I had pledged my word for\r\nColvin's good feeling towards them, that they must now expect the worst\r\nof him. They answered that they knew it, as they had received\r\ninformation already in the same sense about him.\r\n\r\nThis conversation opened my eyes to a new danger. Only the day before I\r\nhad received two letters, written the one from the Liberal, the other\r\nfrom the Tory camp in England, and both conveying the same warning. John\r\nMorley, in answer to a letter I had written asking his sympathy with the\r\nNational cause, wrote: \"Whether your schemes will come to much I am at\r\nthis moment inclined to doubt. Egypt, unluckily for its people, is the\r\nbattlefield of European rivalries; and an honest settlement in the\r\ninterests of its population will be prevented to suit the convenience of\r\nFrance. I don't see my way out of it. It is that curse of the world, _la\r\nhaute politique_, which will spoil everything.\" Lytton also had written:\r\n\"That small portion of the British public which thinks at all of foreign\r\naffairs is much pre-occupied and disturbed in mind by the false position\r\ninto which we are drifting in Egypt, and almost too frightened to speak\r\nloudly on the subject. It seems to me, however, that their ideas are\r\nvery hazy. In my own mind there is no doubt that this is only the first\r\nfruits of a radically wrong policy which has lost us the co-operation of\r\nGermany and Austria, and placed us practically at the mercy of France, a\r\npower with which we can never have any sound or safe alliance.\" Both\r\nletters had been written before the fall of Gambetta, and here I seemed\r\nto hear an echo of their words, especially Morley's words, \"la haute\r\npolitique,\" from the man who had it most in his power to spoil an\r\nhonest settlement, and that to suit the convenience, not of France\r\nmerely, but of England. I was very much alarmed. I have often regretted\r\nmy last words to Colvin on this occasion. \"I defy you,\" I said, \"to\r\nbring about English intervention or annexation.\" I regret it because I\r\nthink it added a personal as well as a political stimulus to his\r\nsubsequent action. It had become a trial of strength between us.\r\n\r\nTwo days later, 2nd February, Sherif Pasha, finding he could not bend\r\nthe National Delegates to his will, and under the influence, I make\r\nlittle doubt, of Colvin's threat of intervention, resigned office, and\r\nwas succeeded, at the choice of the Delegates, by Mahmud Pasha Sami as\r\nPrime Minister, with Arabi as Minister of War, a thoroughgoing\r\nNationalist combination at which all Egypt rejoiced.[9] I heard the news\r\nat my retreat in the desert with mixed feelings of jubilation and\r\nanxiety, an anxiety which was only relieved when on the 27th I received\r\nan answer from Mr. Gladstone to my letter of six weeks before enclosing\r\nto him the National program. The long delay in replying was doubtless\r\ndue to the embarrassment and perplexity as to a policy which Lord\r\nGranville's deal with Gambetta had involved him in. Gambetta's\r\nprovidential fall, however, had now to a large extent freed our\r\nGovernment's hands, and a passage was being inserted in the Queen's\r\nspeech at the opening of Parliament which conveyed something like an\r\nexpression of sympathy with the National Egyptian hopes. This, Mr.\r\nGladstone sent me later, and his letter concluded with the following\r\nreassuring words: \"I feel quite sure,\" he said, \"that unless there be a\r\nsad failure of good sense on one or both, or as I should say, on all\r\nsides, we shall be able to bring this question to a favourable issue. My\r\nown opinions about Egypt were set forth in the 'Nineteenth Century' a\r\nshort time before we took office, and I am not aware as yet of having\r\nseen any reason to change them.\"[10]\r\n\r\nThe reference thus made to his article \"Aggression on Egypt,\" was of the\r\nvery highest importance, for, as already mentioned, the article was a\r\nscathing denunciation of just that forward policy of intervention and\r\nannexation which Colvin had propounded to me. Armed with this proof of\r\nGladstone's goodwill I went back joyfully to Cairo, and was able to tell\r\nArabi that I had not assured him of my sympathy in vain. I found him at\r\nthe War Office surrounded by his friends, and in converse with the\r\nCoptic Patriarch, and with a tribe of idle sycophants as well,\r\nLevantines and Europeans, come to salute the rising sun. Among these the\r\nnew Minister moved with a certain dignified superiority which became him\r\nwell. He was no longer the mere colonel of a regiment, but a man sobered\r\nby the sense of public responsibility, a fellah still, and still a\r\npatriot, but also with the manner of a statesman. He took me aside, and\r\nI showed him Gladstone's letter, and we rejoiced over it together as a\r\nmessage of good omen.\r\n\r\nThe first fruits of Colvin's hostility, nevertheless, we had not long to\r\nwait for. Who precisely was the originator of the lie I do not know, it\r\nwas probably the Khedive, whose malicious jealousy was already at work\r\nagainst his Ministers, but a false report was telegraphed by Reuter to\r\nEurope that the action taken by the Notables against Sherif was due to\r\nmilitary intimidation. A story was related and was repeated at some\r\nlength in the \"Times\" to the effect that Sultan Pasha, the president of\r\nthe Chamber, had only yielded to personal menace, and that Arabi had\r\ndrawn his sword in his presence, and had threatened to make the old\r\nman's children fatherless. It was a foolish tale, for Sultan happened to\r\nbe without offspring, and at Cairo it was laughed at by all who knew the\r\ntruth, and how close an intimacy there was between the two, but it was\r\nsufficient as a weapon to \"ruin the Nationalists,\" and easily passed the\r\ncensorship of the Agency, being reproduced even in Malet's despatches of\r\nthe day, as was a similar tale, which had also been telegraphed, that\r\nthe Khedive's acceptance of Sherif's resignation had been extorted under\r\na like pressure.\r\n\r\nAbsurd, however, as the tale was, Sultan was offended by it, and, as I\r\nwas now generally known to the Deputies as their friend, he begged me to\r\ncall on him and convey to Malet his emphatic denial of the whole story.\r\nI consequently went to Sultan's house, where he had assembled a large\r\nparty of Deputies and other high personages, among whom were the Grand\r\nMufti el Abbasi, Abd el Salaam Bey Mouelhy, Ahmed Bey Siouffi, Ahmed\r\nEffendi, Mahmud, Rahman Effendi, Hamadi, and El Shedid Butros, a leading\r\nCoptic deputy. All these, with Sultan, absolutely denied and repudiated\r\nthe idea that they had acted under any kind of pressure, and Sultan\r\nspoke with indignation of the absurdity of the tale as regarded himself.\r\n\"Ahmed Arabi,\" he said, \"is as a son to me, and knows what is due to me\r\nand due to himself. His place is at the War Office, mine with the\r\nParliament. It is of me that he would ask advice rather than venture to\r\ngive me any on my own concerns, and as to his drawing his sword in my\r\npresence he could only do so if I were attacked by enemies. These are\r\nstories which no one who knows us both could for an instant believe, and\r\nthey are absolutely false. You may take it for certain that the least of\r\nthe members present who represent the people are better judges of their\r\nwants than the greatest of the soldiers. We respect Ahmed Arabi because\r\nwe know him to be a patriot and a man of political intelligence, not\r\nbecause he is a soldier.\" These words of Sultan Pasha's are quoted from\r\na memorandum I made of them at the time. The old man also spoke bitterly\r\nof Malet for encouraging the newsmongers, and begged me to tell him the\r\nfacts, and also to telegraph them to Mr. Gladstone, and make them known\r\nin the London press. This I did to the best of my ability. I sent a full\r\naccount of it to the \"Times,\" though, if I remember rightly, it was, for\r\nsome reason, never printed, and I telegraphed in the same sense to Mr.\r\nGladstone, and also wrote him a long letter giving my view of the\r\ngeneral situation.\r\n\r\nTo Malet I went straight from Sultan's house and expostulated with him\r\nwarmly. But he insisted on the truth of his tale, which he had got, he\r\ntold me first, from Sultan himself, and then not from Sultan but at\r\nsecond hand from \"some one on whom he could depend,\" and, when I\r\npressed him further as to who this was, lost temper and said I had no\r\nright to cross-question him. This was my last talk with him on any\r\npolitical matter. Malet's new attitude proved to me that he, like\r\nColvin, had gone over to the enemy's camp, and was now no longer to be\r\ntrusted. I saw that the situation was a very dangerous one, for between\r\nthem they had the Press and the Foreign Office wholly in their hands,\r\nand though I possessed at home the Prime Minister's ear and a certain\r\npublicity for my views in the \"Times,\" I felt that I was fighting\r\nagainst them at an extreme disadvantage. I consequently decided to delay\r\nno longer my return to England, where I could do more for the Egyptian\r\ninterests than I could at Cairo, by word of mouth and by a personal\r\nappeal to Gladstone. Before going, however, I had numerous conversations\r\nwith the leading Deputies and with my friends at the Azhar, to whom I\r\ncommunicated my design, of which they all approved; and I arranged with\r\nSir William Gregory that after my departure he should continue to defend\r\nthe National cause, in which he was as enthusiastic as I was, in the\r\n\"Times\" and by letter with his friends in England. My thought was to\r\nreturn to Egypt, perhaps, in a few weeks' time, and take part in any\r\nfurther developments that might arise.\r\n\r\nI paid a last visit to Arabi the morning of the day I left for England,\r\n27th February. I had been little more than three months in Egypt, and it\r\nseemed to me like a lifetime, so absorbing had been the interests they\r\nhad brought me. I looked upon Egypt already like a second _patria_, and\r\nintended to throw in my lot with the Egyptians as if they were my own\r\ncountrymen. I was estranged from those of my countrymen in blood,\r\nexcept Gregory, who formed the then little English colony at Cairo.\r\nFollowing Colvin's lead they had all gone over like sheep to ideas of\r\nintervention, for be it noted that it was now no longer French\r\nintervention that was talked of, but English, and at once in English\r\neyes the immorality of aggression had been transformed into a duty. What\r\nhad been abominable when threatened by Gambetta now appealed to them as\r\njust and desirable and patriotic when proposed by Granville. Similarly\r\nthe new Prime Minister at Paris, M. de Freycinet, having reversed his\r\npredecessor's policy of intervention, the French colony were for peace\r\nwith the Nationalists, all except de Blignières and those who had\r\nofficial posts they feared might be suppressed in the new reign of\r\nNational economy.\r\n\r\nColvin and de Blignières were industrious in spreading trepidation among\r\nthe holders of sinecure offices, and it was amusing to note how suddenly\r\nand completely the poet Lord Houghton abandoned his first attitude of\r\nromantic sympathy with Egyptian liberty when his son-in-law, Fitzgerald,\r\nwho had one of these sinecures, represented to him that his daily bread\r\nwas thereby threatened. It was well known, as part of the Nationalist\r\nprogram, that it was intended to reduce the expenditure on unnecessary\r\nsalaries and to suppress the duplicated posts. This was ascribed by\r\nColvin not to its true cause, a very legitimate economy, but to\r\n\"fanaticism,\" a convenient word which began now to be freely used in\r\ndescribing the National movement. What, however, I think more than\r\nanything else was condemned just then by the little group of English\r\nofficials was the \"monstrous\" determination which the Egyptian Chamber\r\nwas said to have come to, if it could secure the right of voting the\r\nBudget, to cut down the subvention of £1,000 a year paid to Reuter's\r\nAgency. Without this it was felt that it would be impossible any longer\r\nto know at Cairo the odds on the Oxford and Cambridge boat race or even\r\non the Derby or Grand Prix. There was a dark hint, too, thrown out that\r\nthe charge of £9,000 a year then figuring in the Budget as a grant in\r\naid to the European Opera House might be reduced, and on this astounding\r\nproof of \"fanaticism,\" Fitzgerald, as a patron of the ballet, was\r\nespecially insistent. These things, with others almost as trifling, were\r\nmade a serious crime to the Notables and to the new Ministry, who were\r\ncountenancing the reductions. I used to hear the tale of their\r\ncomplaints from Gregory, who was now in much closer touch with them than\r\nI any longer was. It was in answer to their threats of intervention,\r\nwhich were beginning to have an effect on the Stock Exchange in the\r\nlowered price of Egyptian Bonds and of property generally in Egypt, that\r\nI at this time resolved to give proof of my confidence in the national\r\nfortunes by buying a small estate for my future residence in the\r\nneighbourhood of Cairo, and the result was my purchase of Eheykh Obeyd\r\nGarden, a property of some forty acres, between Merj and Materieh.\r\n\r\nIt will be interesting to Egyptian readers to know what the prices of\r\nland in that neighbourhood then were. There was, as I have said, at that\r\ntime not a single house built on the desert strip between Abbassiyeh and\r\nKafr el Jamus, and the Government was willing to sell it to anybody who\r\nwould buy it at the rate of a few piastres an acre. I thought at one\r\nmoment of establishing myself on the land where my camp of the moment\r\nstood, and I made inquiry of my friend Rogers Bey, who was in the Land\r\nDepartment of the Ministry of Finance, and I find among my papers the\r\ndraft of an application I sent in for a hundred acres, where now the\r\nsuburb of Zeitoun stands, for which, at his suggestion, I offered\r\nfifteen piastres (three shillings) an acre. The same land is worth\r\nto-day, 1904, at least two hundred pounds an acre, ground value. But\r\nwhile I was in negotiation for it I chanced to hear that Sheykh Obeyd\r\nGarden was in the market, and I purchased it, so to say, \"over the\r\ncounter\" from the Domains' Commission for £1,500. It was then the best\r\nfruit garden in Egypt, enclosed in a wall with a bountiful supply of\r\nwater, and contained, on estimation, 70,000 fruit trees, all in splendid\r\norder.\r\n\r\nThe history of the garden is worth recording. It was a piece of good\r\nland standing on the desert edge, belonging in the early part of the\r\nnineteenth century to the Imam of Ibrahim Pasha's army during the\r\ncampaign of Arabia but the Imam falling into indigent circumstances, the\r\nPasha bought it of him, enclosed thirty-three acres with a wall, dug the\r\nsakiehs, and laid it out as it now is some time in the early thirties.\r\nThe fruit trees with which it was planted were brought in part from Taif\r\nin the Hejaz, in part from Syria. Ibrahim had a passion to make it the\r\nbest of its kind, and in his time and the time of his nephew, Mustafa,\r\nto whom it descended, the fruit from it brought in a yearly revenue of\r\n£800, the labour being all done by _corvée_ of the fellahin of the\r\nneighbouring villages. The pomegranates of the garden were so large that\r\nit was a tradition with the gardeners there that thirty went to a camel\r\nload, and that they were sent yearly to Constantinople as a present to\r\nthe Sultan. What is certain is that in the time of Ibrahim's grandson,\r\nTewfik, when in his father's reign he was living in retirement at\r\nKoubba, the ladies of his household used to be carried there every\r\nFriday during the spring season to spend the day. In the ruin of\r\nIsmaïl's fortunes it came, in 1879, to the Domains Commissioners, and\r\nwas one of the smaller properties scheduled by them for sale, and so it\r\nchanced into the market. On our way to Syria the year before we had\r\ncamped one night outside its walls and had wondered at its beauty with\r\nthe apricot trees in full flower. No sooner did I hear of it as a\r\npossible acquisition than I abandoned all other schemes of purchase; and\r\nin one of its shady walks I am writing my memoirs to-day.\r\n\r\nBut to return to my farewell visit to Arabi. On this occasion we talked\r\nall the questions over which were being debated at the moment by the\r\nNationalists with their plans of reforms and their hopes and fears at\r\nhome and abroad. The few weeks that Arabi had been in high office had\r\nmatured him and strengthened him, and he discussed things with me with\r\nall possible sobriety of thought and language. He assured me\r\nemphatically that he and his fellow Ministers were most anxious to come\r\nto a friendly understanding with the English Government on all matters\r\nin dispute between them and the Agency at Cairo; and he begged me to\r\nconvey to Mr. Gladstone a formal message to that effect. He complained,\r\nhowever, strongly of Malet and Colvin, whose recent action and the part\r\nthey were taking in the campaign of misrepresentation being organized in\r\nthe English Press proved their hostility. \"There will never be peace at\r\nCairo,\" he said, \"as long as we have only these to deal with, for we\r\nknow that they are working mischief against us in secret, if not openly.\r\nWe shall stand aloof from both of them. But we do not on that account\r\nwish to quarrel with England. Let Mr. Gladstone send us whom he will to\r\ntreat with us, and we will receive him with open arms.\" He also talked\r\nat great length of the practical reforms Mahmud Sami and the other\r\nMinisters were contemplating, most of which have since been included in\r\nthe list of benefits conferred on the country under British occupation,\r\nand which Lord Cromer has adopted as his own. Such were the abolition of\r\nthe _corvées_ which the rich Turkish pashas levied on the villagers,\r\ntheir monopoly of the water at the time of the high Nile, the protection\r\nof the fellahin from the Greek usurers, who had them in their clutches\r\nthrough the iniquitous abuses of the International Tribunals, and even\r\nthat latest remedy for agriculture distress on which Lord Cromer\r\nspecially prides himself, an agricultural Bank under Government\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nOther questions discussed were the reform of Justice, then fearfully\r\ncorrupt, the education of men and also of women, the mode of election to\r\nbe adopted for the new Parliament, and the question of slavery. On this\r\npoint he dwelt at some length, because the European officials of the\r\ndepartment concerned in its suppression were beginning, like the other\r\nforeign officials, to fear that in the new National scheme of economy\r\ntheir salaries would be reduced, and were pretending that the Mohammedan\r\nrevival would mean a revival of the slave trade. Arabi showed me how\r\nlittle ground there was for this pretence, that the only persons in\r\nEgypt who still had slaves or wished to have slaves were just the\r\nKhedivial princes and rich pashas, against whose tyranny the fellah\r\nmovement was directed, that according to the principles of the Liberal\r\nreform all men were to be henceforth equal, without distinction of race,\r\nor colour, or religion. The last thing compatible with these was the\r\nrevival of slavery. Lastly, as to the necessity of military preparation\r\nfor a possible war, which as a soldier and war minister he had uppermost\r\nin his mind, he spoke plainly and with energy. The National Government\r\nwould not disarm or relax its precautions until the true Constitutional\r\n_régime_ was firmly established and acknowledged by Europe. He hoped not\r\nto exceed the War Estimates agreed on with Colvin, or to be obliged to\r\nincrease the number of men recruited beyond the 18,000 allowed by the\r\nFirmans. If, however, the menace of armed intervention were long\r\ncontinued they would adopt the Prussian system of short service, and so\r\ngradually bring a larger force as a reserve under arms. He asked my\r\nopinion of the chances of a conflict, and I told him plainly that from\r\nwhat Colvin had boasted to me of his intention to bring it about, and\r\nfrom the means of Press agitation he had already adopted with that end,\r\nI considered the danger a real one, and that it was to neutralize, as\r\nfar as I could, the campaign of lies which had begun that I was going to\r\nEngland. My business there would be to preach the cause of peace and\r\ngoodwill. At the same time I could not advise him to do otherwise than\r\nstand firmly to his ground. The best chance of peace was to be prepared\r\nfor defence. The great enemies of Egypt were not so much the European\r\ngovernments as the European financiers, and these would think twice\r\nabout urging an armed attack if they knew that they could not do so\r\nwithout the risk of ruining their own interests in Egypt by a long and\r\ncostly war. An armed nation resolute and ready to defend its rights was\r\nseldom molested. I remember quoting to him Byron's lines, \"Trust not for\r\nfreedom to the Franks,\" of which he greatly approved; and these, I\r\nthink, were our last words. I promised him that if it came to the worst\r\nI would return and throw in my lot with theirs in a campaign for\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[9] There were one or two weak points in the formation of the new\r\nMinistry, the most important being in the choice made of their Minister\r\nof Foreign Affairs. Neither Mahmud Sami nor Arabi, nor any other of the\r\nfellah leaders, knew any European language, and, as a knowledge of\r\nFrench was essential in dealing with the Consulates, a man not of their\r\nown party or way of thinking was taken in from the outside. This was\r\nMustafa Pasha Fehmi, a man of fairly liberal notions, but a member of\r\nthe old ruling class, and a follower of Sherif's--the same who had been\r\nIsmaïl's A. D. C. in 1878 and had taken an unwilling part in the death\r\nof the Mufettish. It was his horror at this crime that had converted him\r\nto constitutional ideas. But like Sherif he despised his fellah\r\ncolleagues. He, when the pinch came two months later, did these much\r\nill-service by his weak or hostile presentment of their case in the\r\nofficial correspondence. This, as they could not read his notes and\r\ndespatches, they were unaware of till it was too late to remedy.\r\n\r\n[10] For full text of this letter _see_ Appendix.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nMY PLEADING IN DOWNING STREET\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch is the history faithfully and fully told of the part I played that\r\nwinter in Egypt. In telling it I have relied for the accuracy of my\r\nmemory of the main incidents on such letters and short notes as I have\r\nbeen able to find among my papers, and especially on an account of it\r\ndrawn up by me while the war of 1882 was in progress, and published in\r\nthe September number of the \"Nineteenth Century Review\" of that year. Of\r\nthis, my present memoir is little more than an amplification. What\r\nfollows will be comparatively new matter, for though most of it has long\r\nbeen written in a disjointed way, I have never found a moment suited to\r\nits completion. For dates and incidents, however, I am supplied with\r\nample materials of a contemporary value, first in a brief diary which\r\nfrom the time of my arrival in England I now once more regularly kept,\r\nand next in the many published and unpublished letters still in my\r\npossession, which passed between me and various public personages with\r\nwhom I had found myself in correspondence during the four months which\r\nelapsed between my arrival in England and the bombardment of Alexandria;\r\nand again after Tel-el-Kebir with those who on my behalf were conducting\r\nArabi's trial. These form a body of evidence which I shall quote where\r\nneedful, either in the text of my narrative or in an appendix to it.\r\nTaken together, with the necessary thread of explanation, they of\r\nthemselves form an almost complete history of the causes of the war.\r\n\r\nThe political situation which I found on my arrival, 6th March, in\r\nLondon, was a wonderful contrast to that which I had left behind me a\r\nweek before at Cairo. Gladstone had been now nearly two years in office,\r\nand the enthusiasm for Eastern nationalities and Eastern liberty, which\r\nat the elections of 1880 had carried him into power, had cooled down\r\neverywhere, and in official circles had given place to ideas of imperial\r\ncoercion, especially in the case of the Nationalists of Ireland, which\r\nwere by no means of good augury in regard to Egypt. The Cabinet was\r\ndivided into two sections of opinion. The great Whig leaders who\r\ncontrolled the chief departments of the Administration, Hartington,\r\nNorthbrook, Childers, and the rest were all for strong measures,\r\nGladstone, with Harcourt and Bright, almost alone for conciliation, and\r\nthe general feeling of the country was violent against all \"lawlessness\"\r\neverywhere. The Habeas Corpus Act had been suspended in Ireland, and\r\nParnell and a score more of the Nationalist members of Parliament were\r\nactually shut up, untried, in Kilmainham Gaol. Business in the House of\r\nCommons was being obstructed by the remainder of the Irish members, and\r\nthe very name of Nationalism to the Liberal Party had become a byword\r\nand reproach. The atmosphere of Westminster and the public offices was\r\ntherefore not at all favourable to my propaganda of nationalism on the\r\nNile. The only persons really interested in Egypt were those few who\r\nheld Egyptian bonds, and these had been persuaded by Colvin's\r\nmanipulation of the Press that Arabi and the National Party were a set\r\nof fanatical incendiaries who would burn down the Stock Exchange if they\r\ncould get the chance, and who had already succeeded in lowering the\r\nvalue of securities and making dividends precarious.\r\n\r\nAt the Foreign Office the position about Egypt was this. Granville, old\r\nand deaf and very idle, finding himself relieved from the incubus of\r\nGambetta's forward policy, was following his instinct of doing nothing\r\nand letting things settle themselves as placidly as circumstances would\r\nallow him. He did not want to intervene or to take action hostile to the\r\nNationalists or, indeed, action of any kind. He did not even give\r\nhimself the trouble to read the despatches, and he left the work of\r\nlearning what was going on to his private secretaries, and more\r\nespecially to the Under-Secretary of State, Sir Charles Dilke, who was\r\nable to sift the news for him and set before him such facts as he\r\nselected, and such views as suited him. Dilke, who had been with\r\nGambetta the responsible author of the Joint Note of 6th January, was,\r\nnow that Gambetta had disappeared from the direction of affairs in\r\nFrance, become a prime mover on his own account in the policy of\r\nintervention, and was working with Colvin and the financiers to bring\r\nthings to such a pass that his unwilling chief, in spite of himself,\r\nshould be obliged to intervene. Though not himself a Cabinet Minister,\r\nDilke in this had behind him the powerful support in the Cabinet of\r\nChamberlain, a personal friend and ally, whom on foreign matters, which\r\nChamberlain did not affect to understand, he could securely count on.\r\nThe two together had the reputation of being the most advanced Radicals\r\nin the Ministry, and so carried great weight with just that section of\r\nthe Liberal Party which was least inclined on principle to foreign\r\nadventures. The mass of the Radicals in the House of Commons knew\r\nnothing and cared nothing for questions in dispute so far away.\r\n\r\nNevertheless I found that personally I could command considerable\r\nattention. My letters to the \"Times\" had been widely read, and there was\r\na certain curiosity to hear what I had to say. Gregory and I had managed\r\nto invest Arabi with that halo of romance which as champion of the\r\nfellah wrongs was certainly his due, and on that ground, if no other, I\r\ncould always obtain a hearing. Rumours of all kinds were afloat about\r\nhim, ludicrous tales which portrayed him as a Frenchman or a Spaniard in\r\nEgyptian guise, as the paid agent, in turn of the ex-Khedive Ismaïl, of\r\nthe pretender Halim, and of the Sultan--as everything in fact but what\r\nhe really was. I, who had seen him, could explain. It was a matter not\r\nof serious interest with anybody, but, as I have said, of considerable\r\ncuriosity. And so I was listened to.\r\n\r\nMy first visit on arrival was to 10, Downing Street. Here, though I did\r\nnot see Mr. Gladstone himself, I found my friend Hamilton, his private\r\nsecretary, and had with him an altogether satisfactory talk. I was a\r\nlittle doubtful, seeing that I had quarrelled with Malet, how I might be\r\nreceived. But he hastened to assure me that my \"interference\" with\r\nMalet's diplomacy was in no way resented by his chief. On the contrary,\r\nMr. Gladstone was very much obliged to me for my letters, and for the\r\nline I had taken in Egypt. It was a busy time for him, however, just\r\nthen, the busiest of the official year, the weeks before Easter, and the\r\nthoughts of ministers were elsewhere than in Egypt. The Irish question\r\nwas priming everything in Mr. Gladstone's mind. I might, however, make\r\nmy own mind comfortable about the dangers which seemed to threaten at\r\nCairo. They could not lead to serious trouble. Whatever might be the\r\nideas \"over the way\" (meaning the Foreign Office), Mr. Gladstone would\r\nsee that they were not put in practice. Armed intervention with Mr.\r\nGladstone in power was an \"impossibility.\" The mere thought of it was\r\nridiculous. We would talk of it again and I should see Mr. Gladstone\r\nlater. In the meanwhile Hamilton would let Lord Granville know that I\r\nwas come. I left him entirely reassured.\r\n\r\nAnother visit I paid the same morning was to my cousin, Algernon Bourke\r\n(then generally known as \"Button\" to his friends). His rôle in Egyptian\r\naffairs that year was destined to be an important one, and his name, or\r\nrather his pseudo-name, constantly recurs in my diary. His position in\r\nlife was that of a young man of fashion, closely connected with the\r\nofficial world, for he was a younger son of the Lord Mayo who had been\r\nViceroy of India, and was nephew to the Rt. Hon. Robert Bourke\r\n(afterwards Lord Connemara), who had been Under-Secretary for Foreign\r\nAffairs, and was now, in 1882, leader of the Tory opposition in the\r\nHouse of Commons on all questions of foreign politics. Button had also a\r\nposition on the staff of the \"Times,\" not as a writer, but as an\r\nintermediary for Chenery, the editor, with political personages. As a\r\npeer's son he had the _entrée_ to the galleries of both Houses of\r\nParliament, knew everybody and everything that was going on there, was\r\nintimate with people about the Court, with the high world of finance,\r\nand generally with the wire-pullers in the various departments of the\r\nState. Our friendship was a close one, and throughout the trying months\r\nthat followed he was my chief confidant and adviser, having more worldly\r\nwisdom than I then could boast, and a fertility of resource in action\r\naltogether admirable. To him I owed three parts of the publicity I\r\nobtained for my views in the Press, and of the help given me in\r\nparliament. On arrival I narrated to him all that had happened during\r\nthe past winter in Egypt as well as my plans for the future. His view of\r\nthe position was a very different one from Hamilton's, for his intimacy\r\nwith the Rothschilds made him aware of the financial strings that were\r\nbeing pulled in the City to bring about intervention, and he had a low\r\nopinion of Gladstone's ability to understand foreign questions or deal\r\nwith a case where the money interests of all the Stock Exchanges of\r\nEurope were so largely concerned. Still he advised me to maintain the\r\nfooting I had acquired in Downing Street, and use my influence there to\r\nthe best of my ability, holding in reserve, if Gladstone should fail me,\r\nhis own friends of the Opposition, whose assistance, in case of need, he\r\npromised me. For the moment the best I could do would be to talk to\r\neverybody I knew who was in Parliament on both sides of the House, and\r\nto go on writing letters to the \"Times.\" This sound advice I accordingly\r\nproceeded without delay to follow.\r\n\r\nI find in my diary that on the 9th of March I went to see George Howard\r\nand his wife (now Lord and Lady Carlisle), and succeeded in enlisting\r\ntheir sympathies, especially hers, to my plans. She was then, as now, a\r\nstrong politician, and was an absolute believer in Gladstone, and she\r\nadvised me to put my whole trust in him and he would certainly prevent\r\nany mischief being done to liberty. Her husband was less sanguine, but\r\nhe readily agreed to take me to the House of Commons, of which he was a\r\nmember, that afternoon, and introduce me to his friends there of the\r\nLiberal Party, such as he thought could help me best. And so together we\r\nwent, and I made the acquaintance of Dilwyn, Bryce, and other\r\ninfluential members who had been specially interested in the affairs of\r\nBulgaria and Armenia at the time of the Berlin Congress. These all\r\npromised me their assistance, as did that excellent man Mr. Chesson,\r\nwith whom, and with Howard's brother-in-law, Lyulph Stanley, we had a\r\nlong talk in the tea-room. Chesson, though not a Member of Parliament,\r\nwas a person of considerable political power, as he made it his\r\nbusiness, as secretary of the Aborigines Protection Society, to organize\r\nagitations on all questions where aggression on non-European peoples was\r\nthreatened, and he proved throughout of the greatest assistance to me,\r\nas he was in daily communication with the best of the Radical members.\r\nHoward, however, advised me not to put my case into the hands of the\r\n\"professional non-interventionists,\" but rather to work my propaganda on\r\nan independent basis. I was at that time quite new and inexperienced in\r\nEnglish politics, so new that though I was forty-one years of age this\r\nwas the first time I had ever been inside the lobbies of the House of\r\nCommons. I was, however, from that date a frequent visitor there,\r\nacross to the inner lobby being at that time almost free.\r\n\r\nThe same day I had a talk with Philip Currie at the Foreign Office, and\r\na long discussion about Egypt. I found him at first rather put out with\r\nme at what I had been doing at Cairo, the effect of Malet's complaints\r\nof me, and affecting to believe that I had been playing a \"large\r\npractical joke at the expense of the Foreign Office.\" But this did not\r\nlast, and I was able to convince him of the seriousness of the matter,\r\nand of my own earnestness, if not that I was right in my views, and he\r\narranged that I should see Dilke the next day, and also Granville.\r\n\r\nI find also at this date that I had a talk with Lord Miltown, an Irish\r\npeer, which shows the curious connection between Egypt and Ireland in\r\nthe political ideas of the day. \"His, Miltown's, account of Ireland is\r\nsingularly like that of Egypt by the European officials. He thinks the\r\ndifficulty in Ireland got up by agitators; that the Irish fellahin are\r\nnot really with the National Party, and that armed intervention would\r\nset things right.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 10th I saw Dilke at the Foreign Office, having first gone to his\r\nhouse in Sloane Street. He was in a hostile mood, and instead of\r\nlistening to what I had to say, poured out a string of complaints\r\nagainst the new Egyptian ministry, telling me \"that Arabi's government\r\nhad spent half a million sterling on the army since they came into\r\noffice,\" and other absurdities. I knew this story could not be true, as\r\nthe Nationalists had only been in power six weeks, and went to\r\nSanderson, who was then Lord Granville's private secretary (now Sir\r\nThomas Sanderson and head of the Foreign Office), and made him look up\r\nthe question of the fabulous half million, when, on referring to the\r\ndespatch about it, we found that the sum had been spent, not as Dilke\r\nhad told me in the last _six weeks_, but in the last _year_. This\r\nextraordinary misstatement of Dilke's, which he had made to me as a\r\nmatter beyond dispute, may of course have been only a gross blunder, but\r\nit was repeated in the newspapers of the day, several of which were\r\nunder Dilke's inspiration, and is a good example of the way in which\r\nnews, however absurd, prejudicial to the Egyptian Nationalists, was then\r\nbeing circulated by him. Morley was one of the channels he principally\r\nused, and all through the spring and early summer of 1882, the \"Pall\r\nMall Gazette\" (the only paper Gladstone read attentively) was, through\r\nDilke's influence, and Colvin's, made a channel of preposterous lies and\r\nthe most uncompromising advocate of intervention. Morley, I am willing\r\nto believe, persuaded himself that the things they told him were true,\r\nand acted in good faith, but it is nevertheless certain that on him more\r\nthan on any other journalists of the time lies the responsibility of\r\nhaving persuaded Gladstone to the act of violence in Egypt which was the\r\nchief sin of Gladstone's public career. Morley's position, however, was\r\nthen not an independent one, and he was hardly the master of his own\r\npublished thoughts. He was not yet in Parliament, but waiting for a\r\nseat, and all his hope of a political career lay in the patronage of his\r\npolitical friends, Dilke and Chamberlain, so that he had practically no\r\nchoice, if he was not to sacrifice his ambition, but to follow the lead\r\nDilke gave him about Egyptian affairs. He was afterwards sorry for the\r\nevil he had done, and has never, I think, liked to recall to memory the\r\npart he then played. But without doubt his responsibility for bringing\r\non the war was great. The whole of the Egyptian episode in Morley's\r\n\"Life of Gladstone,\" it may be noticed, has been slurred over in a few\r\npages. But history is history, and his mistake needs to be recorded.\r\n\r\nThis matter settled with Sanderson, Currie took me in to see Lord\r\nGranville, whom I did not as yet know, and another conversation\r\nfollowed. Lord Granville was a man of singularly urbane manners, and\r\nbegan by inquiries after my stud of Arab horses, paying me a number of\r\npolite compliments about them. Then, turning to the subject of Egypt, he\r\n\"informed me plump that he had certain knowledge that Arabi had been\r\nbought by Ismaïl, and that the whole thing in Egypt was an intrigue to\r\nrestore the ex-Khedive!\" This was another of the preposterous stories\r\nthat were being foisted on the Foreign Office and the public to\r\nprejudice opinion against the Egyptian cause. It had reached the Foreign\r\nOffice, as far as I have been able to ascertain, in a despatch or\r\nprivate letter from Sir Augustus Paget, then British Ambassador at Rome,\r\nto whom the ex-Khedive appears to have boasted at Naples that he had \"ce\r\ngaillard là,\" meaning Arabi, in his pocket.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to inquire what motive of the moment Ismaïl may\r\nhave had for making this assertion, for his word was never of any value,\r\nwhile the whole tenor of Arabi's career proves it to have been the\r\nabsolute reverse of fact. Arabi's attitude at the date in question was\r\nmore than ever one of hostility to the Circassian pashas, Ismaïl's\r\nadherents, who were actively intriguing with Tewfik against him. Ismaïl,\r\nhowever, had purposes of his own to serve in making it appear that the\r\ntrouble in Egypt had come about on his account. He always clung to the\r\nidea that the day would come when the Powers of Europe would repent of\r\nhaving deposed him, and would return to him as the only possible ruler\r\nof a country distracted because he was no longer there to control it. At\r\nthe moment I did not know the quarter from which the story was derived,\r\nnor could I do more to refute it than by telling Lord Granville how\r\nutterly opposed to the ex-Khedive the National fellah leader had always\r\nbeen.[11] This I did, and I delivered also the message Arabi had\r\nentrusted me with for Mr. Gladstone. His only answer was \"Will they give\r\nup the claim of the Chamber to vote the Budget?\" I told him that I\r\nfeared it was hopeless to expect this, as the Deputies were all of one\r\nmind. \"Then,\" he said, \"I look upon their case as hopeless. It must end\r\nby their being put down by force.\" I told him I could not believe the\r\nEnglish Government could really intervene, on such a plea, to put down\r\nliberty. But he maintained his ground, and I left him much dissatisfied,\r\nresolving that I would waste no more time upon trying to persuade the\r\nForeign Office, but would put what pressure I could on them from the\r\noutside. \"I must see Gladstone.\"\r\n\r\nI also, the same day, saw Morley at his newspaper office, to try to\r\nneutralize the effect of the falsehoods with which he was being flooded,\r\nbut I feared without success. He believed implicitly in Colvin, who was\r\nhis regular correspondent at Cairo, and there were other influences\r\nbesides, as we have seen, at work upon him and which were too strong for\r\nme to combat in his mind.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th I dined with Button, who had invited a party specially to\r\nmeet me. These were Sir Francis Knollys, the Prince of Wales's\r\nsecretary, Reginald Brett (now Lord Esher), who was then Lord\r\nHartington's secretary, Clifford, a leader writer of the \"Times,\" and\r\nGeneral Sir John Adye, who was a friend of Wolseley's and served under\r\nhim that year in the Egyptian Campaign, remaining, nevertheless, a warm\r\nsympathizer with the Egyptians throughout, and, as will be seen,\r\nrendering good service to the cause of humanity after Tel-el-Kebir. We\r\nhad a pleasant evening, and all showed themselves interested in my\r\nEgyptian views, and I remained talking with some of them till one in the\r\nmorning. Knollys I know was impressed by what I told him, but Brett, who\r\nwas a friend of the Rothschilds and other financiers who were clamouring\r\nfor intervention, proved afterwards one of our bitterest enemies. He was\r\nworking at the time for Morley in the \"Pall Mall Gazette,\" and inspired,\r\nif he did not write, some of the articles which so influenced Gladstone.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th I saw Goschen, having been sent to him by Hamilton, on Mr.\r\nGladstone's suggestion, as a man who, though not a member of the\r\nGovernment, was much trusted by them and advised them, especially on\r\nEgyptian affairs. With him I went more thoroughly than with either Dilke\r\nor Granville into the details of the National case. He affected much\r\nsympathy with me, more probably than he felt, and was particularly\r\nanxious to impress on me the notion that he was not taking a financial\r\nview of the situation. This was, doubtless, because his past connection\r\nwith Egypt had been as representative of Ismaïl's creditors. I found him\r\nagreeable in manner, with much charm of voice, and I was with him quite\r\ntwo hours. His last words to me were: \"You may be sure at least of one\r\nthing, and that is, that whatever the Government may do in Egypt they\r\nwill do on general grounds of policy, not in the interests of the\r\nBondholders.\" This was satisfactory and seemed to be in harmony with the\r\nsituation of the moment, for that very morning the news had been\r\npublished of de Blignières' resignation of his post at Cairo of French\r\nFinancial Controller. The event had been interpreted in London as\r\nsignifying a quarrel between the French Government and the Nationalist\r\nMinistry, but I knew that this was not the case. De Blignières had been\r\neven more and earlier than Colvin a worker for intervention, and I read\r\nhis resignation for what it really was, a sign that his Government had\r\nthrown him over. If Colvin at the same time had been made to resign--and\r\nthings, I believe, were very near it--all the subsequent trouble might\r\nhave been avoided. Colvin, however was too strongly backed up by Dilke\r\njust then to be displaced.\r\n\r\nI went on from Goschen's to lunch with Button, and found him with Lord\r\nDe la Warr, a very worthy Tory peer and country neighbour of my own in\r\nSussex, who had been the year before in Tunis, and had there imbibed,\r\nduring the French invasion, a certain sympathy with the Arabs. Later we\r\nworked a good deal together on the Egyptian question, and he proved of\r\nconsiderable assistance when things came, in July, to a crisis. I was at\r\nthat time urging that a Commission of Inquiry should be sent to Cairo,\r\nand it seemed that he, perhaps, might fill the post.\r\n\r\nThe same afternoon I saw Hamilton in Downing Street. A violent article,\r\nheaded \"Smouldering Fires in Egypt,\" had just appeared in the \"Pall\r\nMall,\" which was little better from beginning to end than a tissue of\r\nthe old malicious stories, with some new ones prejudicial to the\r\nNationalists. To these Hamilton pointed as a convincing proof, seeing\r\nthey were in the \"Pall Mall,\" that I must be wrong, \"Or why,\" he said,\r\n\"should Morley, who is so good a Liberal, take such a very illiberal\r\nline?\" I explained to him Colvin's position in regard to Morley, which I\r\nhad not yet done, and urged him again to let me speak with his chief. Up\r\nto this point, from a feeling of loyalty to men who had been my friends,\r\nand with whom I had acted during the earlier stages, I had refrained\r\nfrom making complaints against them, though Malet had not scrupled to\r\ncomplain of me. But now I saw that further silence on my part would be\r\nonly mischievous, and I was resolved to tell Gladstone all the truth\r\nabout them. Morley had the day before warned me of the impending article\r\nas one to which I would not assent, and had invited an answer to it. But\r\nI was too angry to reply, except with a short private note, which I\r\nfollowed next day by a visit to Northumberland Street, where I\r\nreproached him with printing the malicious nonsense. The evil, however,\r\nhad been done, for the publication had immediately preceded a motion in\r\nthe House of Commons brought forward by Sir George Campbell in regard to\r\nEgypt where the defamatory tales had been made use of. I was present at\r\nthe debate on the motion, in which the principal speaker for the\r\nGovernment was Goschen, who adopted a conciliatory attitude, but less\r\nthan a quite friendly one to Egyptian Nationalism. My conversation with\r\nhim in the morning may have saved us from a worse pronouncement. Still\r\nthere was no definite declaration made favourable to liberty.\r\n\r\nMy diary for 14th March notes a talk with Sir Henry Rawlinson, the\r\nformer Minister to Persia, a distinguished Oriental historian, his views\r\nbeing of the strongest Anglo-Indian official type. The Egyptians had\r\nalways, he said, been slaves, and slaves they would remain. Their\r\ncountry would be absorbed with the rest of Asia by England or\r\nRussia. He knew Asiatics too well to believe they had any taste for\r\nself-government. Also another talk with Walter, the proprietor of the\r\n\"Times,\" whom Button had suggested I should see. He conversed in\r\nplatitudes for half an hour, and in the end, promised he would send a\r\nspecial correspondent to Cairo for independent news. (This, however, was\r\nnot done, Macdonald, the manager, objecting on the score of needless\r\nexpense.)\r\n\r\nOn the 15th I went to see Sir Garnet Wolseley at the Horse Guards, and\r\nhad with him a conversation which needs special mention. \"After a little\r\ntalk about Cyprus, we got upon Egypt and the chance of resistance on the\r\npart of the Nationalists in the case of intervention, and he asked me my\r\nopinion. I said, of course, they would fight, and not only the soldiers\r\nbut the people also, and afterwards, perhaps, use other methods. He\r\nrefused to believe that the army would fight at all. But I maintained\r\nthe contrary, and told him if they sent him out to conquer Egypt in its\r\npresent mood, he must be prepared to take with him at least 60,000 men.\"\r\nIn this I no doubt exaggerated the case, for my object was to represent\r\nit as a very difficult one, which the Government should think twice\r\nabout before attempting. \"He volunteered the information that he had\r\nbeen consulted two or three times during the winter with a view to\r\nimmediate occupation. He assured me, however, that nobody wanted to\r\nintervene, that the occupation of Egypt would be most unpopular with the\r\narmy, and that he himself should be very sorry to have to go there. He\r\nwould far rather the Egyptians should disband their army and trust to\r\nEuropean protection. But I told him I could not advise them to do that,\r\nand that people were not often attacked who really meant fighting. He\r\nsaid, 'Well, of course there is no such thing as honour in war, and if\r\nthere were really any question of fighting, they ought not to trust us\r\nmore than other people.'\" He then talked about the various military\r\nroutes to Cairo, Bonaparte's, by the left bank of the Nile, and\r\nespecially the desert way between the Suez Canal and the Delta, so that\r\nI felt pretty sure that if troops were landed it would be on that side.\r\nBut I was careful to give him no information which could be of the least\r\nuse to him, and I only laughed when he half seriously asked me whether I\r\nwould go with him and show him the way if it came to a campaign. My\r\nimpression of Wolseley was of \"a good smart soldier, an Irishman, with a\r\nrough touch of brogue, good humoured, and I should fancy enterprising.\r\nBut he does not impress me as a man of genius--what Napoleon used to\r\ncall a '_général à dix mille hommes_.'\" It is worth noting that in\r\nwriting to Sheykh Mohammed Abdu, through my secretary, Sabunji, soon\r\nafter this conversation, I alluded to the danger there might be, in case\r\nof intervention, of their being attacked from the Ismaïlia side, and I\r\nbelieve it was in consequence of this hint that the lines of Tel-el\r\nKebir were begun to be traced by Arabi's order.\r\n\r\nThe same day I saw Lyall, whom I found just starting for India, where he\r\nhad been named Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West Provinces. I found\r\nhim much less sceptical about the National Party in Egypt than was the\r\ncase then with most Anglo-Indians. In the evening I dined with Hamilton\r\nand Godley, Gladstone's two private secretaries, and showed them the\r\ndraft of a letter I had written to Lord Granville, in which I had\r\nformally delivered Arabi's message of goodwill to the English\r\nGovernment, and also his complaint against Colvin and Malet, which I had\r\nnot mentioned to him, for the reason already given, when I saw him at\r\nthe Foreign Office. Of this draft the two secretaries highly approved,\r\nand especially Godley, who was the senior of the two, and he made me\r\nstrike out a phrase I had introduced of apology for my interference in\r\nthis important public matter. He said emphatically, \"Your interference\r\nneeds no excuse.\" Godley was a singularly high-minded man, representing\r\nthe better and more enthusiastic side of Gladstone's public character,\r\nthe large sympathy with what was good in the world and the scorn of what\r\nwas base. Except that he had great practical ability for his official\r\nwork, he was absolutely unlike the men usually found in our public\r\noffices, and throughout the Egyptian crisis he gave me his warmest\r\nsupport and sympathy. Hamilton, though also sympathetic, was more so\r\nbecause he was my personal friend than from any natural enthusiasm for\r\nthe kind of cause I was defending. My letter ended with a suggestion\r\nthat something in the nature of an official inquiry should be sent to\r\nCairo to examine into the facts in a spirit friendly to the Egyptians.\r\nThey both urged me to send in the letter, and I consequently did so four\r\ndays later, under the date 20th March. Its importance justifies my\r\ngiving it here _in extenso_:\r\n\r\n     \"London, _March 20th_, 1882.\r\n\r\n     \"The kindness with which your Lordship was good enough to listen to\r\n     me on certain points of the political situation in Egypt,\r\n     encourages me to offer you the following suggestions for your\r\n     further consideration:\r\n\r\n     \"If I rightly understood your Lordship, Her Majesty's Government\r\n     are not desirous of precipitating matters in that direction, but\r\n     would be willing to accept a peaceable solution, could such be\r\n     found, of the question in dispute between the Control and the\r\n     Egyptian Government, and would only resort in the last instance to\r\n     force were the political interests of England to be seriously\r\n     impaired, or international engagements actually broken by the\r\n     National Party now in power.\r\n\r\n     \"Now, I am sufficiently well acquainted with the views of that\r\n     party, or, at least, of their most prominent leaders, to be able to\r\n     speak positively to the fact that there is nothing nearer to their\r\n     wishes than a good understanding with Her Majesty's Government.\r\n     Indeed, I have the authority of Arabi Bey to assure your Lordship\r\n     that, if addressed in a friendly manner, he will use his utmost\r\n     influence with his party, and it is very great, to allay the bitter\r\n     feelings which have arisen between the Egyptians and the English\r\n     and other officials employed in the country, and that he would meet\r\n     half-way any negotiations which may be entered into with a view to\r\n     a peaceable arrangement. He has begged me, however, to lay before\r\n     you the difficulties of the position in which he is placed by the\r\n     attitude of personal hostility displayed towards him by the English\r\n     Controller-General, and to a certain extent also by Her Majesty's\r\n     Minister.\r\n\r\n     \"Sir Auckland Colvin, as your Lordship is well aware, has taken a\r\n     prominent political part in the various ministerial changes, and in\r\n     what it is perhaps necessary to call the revolution, which the last\r\n     six months have witnessed in Egypt. On the 9th of September it was\r\n     he who advised the Khedive to arrest and shoot this very Arabi Bey,\r\n     now Minister of War; and he has taken no pains to conceal the fact,\r\n     having himself, as I understand, communicated the details of what\r\n     then happened to the English newspapers. It is also well known to\r\n     the Egyptians that he has been and still is in communication with\r\n     the press in a sense hostile to the National Party, and especially\r\n     to the army, and that on the occasion of Sherif Pasha's resignation\r\n     he unreservedly stated his intention to 'use every means in his\r\n     power to ruin the National Party and bring about intervention.' If\r\n     these things were known only to Arabi, he might, he assures me,\r\n     overlook them; but, unfortunately, they are matters of public\r\n     notoriety, a fact which makes it impossible for him to show himself\r\n     on terms of intimacy with their author.\r\n\r\n     \"Of Sir Edward Malet he has expressed himself less decidedly, but\r\n     still partly in the same sense. It has been a misfortune of Sir\r\n     Edward's position with the Egyptians that his visit to\r\n     Constantinople closely coincided with the strong advocacy of\r\n     Turkish intervention which the English press displayed last autumn,\r\n     and I am myself convinced that the French Government are\r\n     responsible for the belief, which is ineradicable in all minds at\r\n     Cairo, that he has at various times suggested military action. I\r\n     know, myself, that this is untrue, and that Sir Edward has, on the\r\n     contrary, deprecated any such solution of his difficulties; but\r\n     certain facts remain, which lend a colour to the idea. Thus to the\r\n     very date of the assembling of the Egyptian Chamber he refused to\r\n     recognize the National demand for Constitutional Government as a\r\n     serious matter; again, he joined Sir Auckland Colvin in displaying\r\n     a marked partisanship for Sherif in his quarrel with the deputies;\r\n     and he has since given offence by expressing his belief in a\r\n     story, wholly unfounded and peculiarly irritating to those\r\n     deputies, namely, that their President, Sultan Pasha, a man\r\n     universally respected, had been personally insulted by Arabi.\r\n\r\n     \"Be this as it may, it is certain both Sir Edward Malet and Sir\r\n     Auckland Colvin, instead of being in a position to advise and\r\n     restrain are practically 'in Coventry' with the Egyptian\r\n     Government. They are shut out from all true sources of information\r\n     regarding their plans, and are compelled to leave the field open to\r\n     intriguers of other nationalities who have no interest in advising\r\n     moderation or desire to avert a rupture.\r\n\r\n     \"If your Lordship should find that there is any reason in my\r\n     argument thus stated, I may perhaps be permitted to make the\r\n     following suggestion.\r\n\r\n     \"The National Ministers are now engaged in preparing a series of\r\n     grave complaints against the working of the system established by\r\n     England and France and sanctioned by the Control, some of which\r\n     complaints are certainly well founded. They are willing to approach\r\n     the inquiry in a moderate and friendly spirit, but they will\r\n     certainly approach it in a hostile one if the Control and diplomacy\r\n     continue hostile. The matters in dispute are largely matters of\r\n     fact which, if justice is to be observed and an undoubted moral\r\n     standing ground acquired by Her Majesty's Government, should be\r\n     examined in an absolutely impartial mood and on the evidence no\r\n     less of the Egyptians than of the Europeans. That evidence, I\r\n     submit, it is out of the reach of Her Majesty's representatives,\r\n     diplomatic and financial, to procure, and that impartiality will\r\n     certainly be suspected in their case by the Egyptians. Would it not\r\n     then be advisable, during the six months which must elapse before\r\n     the Egyptian Parliament reassembles and the conflict be engaged, to\r\n     send something in the nature of a commission of inquiry to examine\r\n     into the facts complained of in a friendly spirit, the only spirit\r\n     which can possibly avert disaster.\"\r\n\r\nTo continue from my diary I find that on the 16th I wrote, with\r\nSabunji's help as scribe, a long letter to Arabi, telling him that I was\r\nasking for a Commission to be appointed and that I was in good hopes,\r\nbut entreating him to be cautious; and also to Gregory, who was still at\r\nCairo. The situation in Egypt then was that the Chamber of Delegates,\r\nhaving insisted upon the right they had claimed to vote that half of the\r\nBudget which was not affected to the payment of the interest on the\r\ndebt, a new _Leyha_, or organic law, granting a Constitution on European\r\nmodels had been signed, as we have seen, by the Khedive and published.\r\nThe Ministers had also presented to the Chamber of Deputies a list of\r\npractical reforms, all of which were much needed and most of which have\r\nsince, after many years, been carried out. Which done, the Chamber had\r\nbeen adjourned till the autumn. Absolute tranquillity had meanwhile\r\nprevailed throughout the country, and the sole cause of quarrel with\r\nEurope was the financial one of the vote, a dispute which could not\r\nbecome acute for at least six months, when the next new budget would be\r\nframed. There is not the smallest doubt that if Colvin had been induced\r\nto join his French colleague, de Blignières, in retiring from Egypt, and\r\nmy suggestion of the Commission had been adopted, things in Egypt would\r\nhave quieted down and all cause for armed intervention would have\r\ndisappeared. The Egyptian Ministry desired nothing more than to live at\r\npeace with the whole world and to come to an understanding with the Dual\r\nGovernments on all disputed questions.\r\n\r\nOn 20th March I lunched at Button's to meet his uncle, Robert Bourke,\r\nwho was to bring forward the Egyptian question next week formally in\r\nParliament. With him was another Tory member, Montague Guest, who had\r\ninterested himself in the cause of Tunis. These were among the second\r\nstrings to my bow, if Gladstone should fail me. Then I attended a\r\nmeeting of the Asiatic Society, to which I had just been elected, and in\r\nthe evening dined with Rivers Wilson. With Wilson I \"quarrelled\r\nfearfully about Egypt.\" He told me he had helped to draw up a new Note,\r\nat the Foreign Office, which was now being despatched to Malet,\r\n\"insisting on the fulfilment of all International engagements,\" a Note\r\nintended to be a new menace to the National Party, but which I think was\r\nnever sent, or perhaps cancelled, as it does not appear in the Blue\r\nBook. My letter to Granville may have been the cause of its suppression.\r\nWilson insisted that the whole National movement was an invention of\r\nIsmaïl's, and that \"if the ex-Khedive were to land to-morrow at\r\nAlexandria, every Egyptian would come to him on his hands and knees.\"\r\nFrom this dinner I went on to a party at Lady Kenmare's, where I met\r\nLady Salisbury, who took me aside, and cross-questioned me with much\r\nappearance of sympathy about the Egyptian cause, and I laid it before\r\nher to the best of my ability, knowing that what I said would be\r\nrepeated to her husband. Of course there could be no real sympathy in\r\nany of the Tories, especially in Lord Salisbury, for my views on\r\nEgyptian liberty, but it suited the Opposition to take me up to just the\r\nextent that would help them to bring the Government into discredit,\r\nSalisbury himself was throughout a thoroughgoing advocate of\r\nintervention. I walked home that evening with Hamilton, whom I had found\r\nat the party, and told him of Wilson's boast about the new Note, and\r\nentreated him to get me immediate audience of his chief, and he urged me\r\nto send in my letter at once to Granville, and also a copy of it to\r\nGladstone. This I did the following morning, entrusting both to Hamilton\r\nfor delivery. He had already, 21st March, arranged an interview for me\r\nwith his chief for the next day. A dinner in the evening at Robert\r\nBourke's, General Taylor, the Opposition Whip, Lady Ely, and a number\r\nmore Tories.\r\n\r\n_March 22._--This was a most important day. I had now been a full\r\nfortnight in England, and, though I had certainly not let any grass grow\r\nunder my feet, I had nevertheless failed as yet to get speech of the\r\nPrime Minister. To-day, however, made me ample amends. I went a little\r\nbefore the hour appointed to Downing Street, so as to have time for a\r\nfew words with Hamilton, who told me his chief had read my letter; and\r\nat twenty minutes past eleven I was received by him. Mr. Gladstone I\r\nfound looking far better and younger than when I had seen him last,\r\nnearly two years before. Then he had seemed on his decline, but now he\r\nseemed vigorous and singularly alert in mind and body. He received me\r\nvery kindly. My letter to Lord Granville was before him on the table,\r\nand he was evidently prepared and eager for what I had to say. He told\r\nme to tell him all, and, without talking much himself, listened. His\r\nmanner was so encouraging and sympathetic that I spoke easily and with\r\nan eloquence I had never had before, and I could see that every word I\r\nsaid interested and touched him. He let me speak on for perhaps a\r\nquarter of an hour, only from time to time interjecting some such words\r\nas \"you need not tell me this, for I know it,\" as when I would prove\r\nthe reality of the National feeling in Egypt. His sympathy was obviously\r\nand strongly with the movement.\r\n\r\nThen he asked me a question about the position of the army and the\r\nreason of the prominent part taken by it in public affairs. Of this he\r\nwas suspicious. I explained the history to him and assured him that the\r\ninterference of the soldiers had been greatly exaggerated, and the\r\nstories of their intimidation of the Deputies were quite untrue; that\r\nthe sole reason for the present military preparations was the dread of\r\nforeign intervention. I explained the feeling of the Party towards the\r\nSultan and the Viceregal family--towards Tewfik, the ex-Khedive, and\r\nHalim. He asked me whether I had told all this to Lord Granville. I\r\nsaid: \"He stopped me at the outset by telling me that Arabi had been\r\nbought by Ismaïl! What could I say?\" Just at that moment somebody looked\r\nin and told Mr. Gladstone that Lord Granville was in the house and had\r\nsent up his name, and I was terribly afraid Mr. Gladstone was going to\r\nlet him in, which would have prevented me from telling my full story.\r\nBut with a look of annoyance he went out for an instant, and sent Lord\r\nGranville away, and then came back with a sort of skip across the room\r\nand rubbing his hands as one might do on having got rid of a bore. The\r\ngesture was an extraordinary encouragement to me, and he at once made me\r\ngo on.\r\n\r\nI delivered all Arabi's messages about the Slave Trade and the other\r\nprojects of reform, and then went on to explain Colvin's position and\r\nMalet's. He said, almost pathetically, \"What can we do? They are\r\nesteemed public servants and have received _honours_ for their work in\r\nEgypt.\" He insisted upon the word _honours_. He then asked me to tell\r\nhim something about the civilian leaders of the National Party, and I\r\nexplained the position of some of them, Mohammed Abdu, Ahmed Mahmud,\r\nSaadallah Hallabi, Hassan Shereï, and others of the Deputies, and,\r\nlastly, Abdallah Nadim, journalist and orator. This designation at once\r\nexcited Mr. Gladstone, and the account of his eloquence, and he took\r\ndown his name upon a slip of paper. Thus time slipped away till it was\r\ntwelve o'clock, and he had another appointment. I had been with him\r\nforty minutes--a very fast forty minutes too. As I was going out I\r\nturned and asked him, with a sudden thought, whether I might not send\r\nArabi some message from him in answer to his messages. He thought an\r\ninstant and said, \"I think not.\" And very slowly and deliberately: \"But\r\nyou are at liberty to state your own impression of my sentiments,\" and\r\nthen in a sort of House of Commons voice, which was in strange contrast\r\nwith the extremely personal and human tone in which he had been\r\nconversing: \"If they wish to judge of these, let them read what we say\r\nin Parliament, especially what I say, for I never speak lightly in\r\nParliament. In our public despatches we are much hampered by the opinion\r\nof Europe, which we are bound to consider, and this is not favourable to\r\nLiberal institutions in Egypt. But they should read our speeches.\" He\r\nhad turned to the table, for we were half-way across the room, and took\r\nup a paper which was on it, a despatch already signed, and which I felt\r\nsure was that which Wilson had told me he had helped to draft, and\r\nseemed on the point of showing it to me--and then refrained and put it\r\ndown again. Once more his manner became natural and intimate. He thanked\r\nme again for my letters and all that I had told him, and begged me to\r\nlet him hear if any new combination arose. His extreme kindness as he\r\nshook hands with me moved me greatly and I was near shedding tears, and\r\nwent away feeling that he was a good as well as a great man, and\r\nwondering only how any one with so good a heart could have arrived at\r\nbeing Prime Minister. \"_El hamdu l'Illah. El hamdu l'Illah_,\" I kept\r\nrepeating to myself, \"_El nasr min Alah, wa fathon karibon_.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the Gladstone I saw unveiled for a moment that day--a man of\r\ninfinite private sympathy with good, and of whom one would affirm it\r\nimpossible he should swerve a hair's breadth from the path of right.\r\nBut, alas, there was another Gladstone, the opportunist statesman, who\r\nwas very different from the first, and whom I was presently to see\r\nplaying in public \"such fantastic tricks before high Heaven as make the\r\nangels weep.\" I will attempt a character, drawn from my observation of\r\nhim, which was a close one, during the next ten years, of this very\r\nremarkable personality.\r\n\r\nGladstone, as I have said, was two personages. His human side was very\r\ncharming. He had an immense power of sympathy, and what I may call a\r\nlavish expenditure of enthusiasm for such things as attracted him, and\r\nhe had also a certain humility of attitude, often towards persons far\r\ninferior to himself, which compelled their affectionate regard, as did\r\ncertain little human weaknesses which have found no place in any\r\nmemorial of him that has yet been published. All this made him beloved,\r\nespecially by the young, by the women who knew him well, both those who\r\nwere good and those who were less good. This was the happy, the\r\nconsistent part of him. His public life was to large extent a fraud--as\r\nindeed the public life of every great Parliamentarian must be. The\r\ninsincerities of debate were ingrained in him. He had begun them at\r\nschool and college before he entered the House of Commons, and by the\r\ntime he was thirty he had learnt to look upon the \"Vote of the House\" as\r\nthe supreme criterion of right and wrong in public things. In deference\r\nto this he had had constantly to put aside his private predilections of\r\npolicy, until towards the end of his life his own personal impulses of\r\ngood had assumed the character of tastes rather than of principles. They\r\nwere like his taste for music, his taste for china, his taste for\r\n_bric-à-brac_, feelings he would like to indulge, but was restrained\r\nfrom by a higher duty, that of securing a Parliamentary majority. This\r\nwas his ultimate reason of all action, his true conscience, to which his\r\nnobler aspirations had constantly to be sacrificed. His long habit, too,\r\nof publicity, had bred in him, as it does in actors, a tendency to\r\nself-deception. From constantly acting parts not really his own, he had\r\nacquired the power of putting on a character at will, even, I believe,\r\nto his inmost thoughts. If he had a new distasteful policy to pursue,\r\nhis first object was to persuade himself into a belief that it was\r\nreally congenial to him, and at this he worked until he had made himself\r\nhis own convert, by the invention of a phrase or an argument which\r\nmight win his approbation. Thus he was always saved the too close\r\nconsciousness of his insincerities, for like the tragedian in Dickens,\r\nwhen he had to act Othello, he began by painting himself black all over.\r\nI believe this is not an unfair estimate of Gladstone's public\r\ncharacter. Certainly it is the light in which his actions showed him to\r\nme in his betrayal that year of the Egyptian cause.\r\n\r\nAs yet, however, I had no misgiving, and in the next few days wrote\r\nletters to my friends at Cairo detailing the good news. With Gladstone\r\non our side, what more was there to fear? Only I prayed them to be\r\npatient till the Commission I had asked for should arrive. That some\r\nattempt was made by Lord Granville to carry out my suggestion is clear\r\nfrom the Blue Books. But Granville's heart was also as clearly not in\r\nit, or he was thwarted by Dilke or others in the Foreign Office. He\r\nwrote me a note on the 24th asking me to luncheon, when I should have an\r\nopportunity of discussing the question of the Commission, but by an\r\naccident, which was probably not an accident, the note did not reach me\r\ntill too late, a manoeuvre which was repeated with the same result a\r\nweek later. The Blue Books record a little abortive negotiation with\r\nFrance for a special inquiry, but it was soon dropped, and Lord\r\nGranville's favourite method of dawdling things out is responsible for\r\nthe rest. Before many weeks had passed, the intriguers at Cairo had\r\neffected their purpose of a new disturbance, and the difficulties of\r\nconciliation had become enormously increased.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the short session before Easter in London may be briefly\r\ntold. I went down for a few days to Crabbet to see after my private\r\naffairs, but that did not prevent me from writing to my friends in\r\nEgypt, Arabi and Mohammed Abdu and Nadim, telling them of my success\r\nwith Gladstone and imploring their prudence. On the 26th I received a\r\nletter from Button, enclosing a note from a person in a very responsible\r\nposition, which I find still among my papers. It is so short and\r\ninstructive that I give it as it stands:\r\n\r\n\"_22nd._ I am very anxious that Mr. Wilfrid Blunt should meet and see\r\nNatty Rothschild, whose Egyptian interests require no explanation. He\r\ngoes to Lord Granville and the Foreign Office so constantly, and in this\r\nmatter, like St. Paul, 'dies daily.' To bring them to an intelligent\r\nunderstanding on this vexed question would be a real service. I am\r\ndesired to ask if you could bring W. Blunt to luncheon at New Court on\r\nFriday next at 1 P.M. _Do_ if you possibly can. It will be _useful_ in\r\nmany ways.\"\r\n\r\nHere, of course, was the real crux of the situation, the nine millions\r\nof the Rothschild loan supposed to be in danger in Egypt, half of which,\r\nButton told me, was still held by the Rothschilds themselves. I\r\nconsequently went up to London on the morning of the 27th, the day\r\nnamed, and under Button's wing to the City, but by misfortune only to\r\nfind that \"Natty\" had been called that morning abroad on account of the\r\nillness or death of a near relation, I forget which. We consequently did\r\nnot see him, but he had left a message instead, begging me to write him\r\nmy views. I regret the accident which prevented the meeting, for it\r\nwould have been interesting, though I do not suppose it would have\r\neffected any good. I have often wondered since what would have been the\r\nnature of the \"intelligent understanding\" so much desired; and I have\r\nsometimes suspected that the common financial argument might have been\r\ntried with me in the shape of shares to bring about an arrangement with\r\nArabi for the betrayal of his political trust. Some such, it seems, was\r\ntried upon Arabi two months later through another channel. Nothing,\r\nhowever, came of the visit, except that I wrote my memorandum, too long\r\na one here to quote, the object of it being to recommend, as a matter of\r\npolicy, that financiers who had interests in Egypt should accept the\r\nrevolution that had occurred and make the best of it, and predicted that\r\nbondholders would lose more by a war than by conciliation. I have since\r\nbeen told that Rothschild, who, after great tribulation and anguish of\r\nmind at the time of the bombardment of Alexandria and nearly in despair\r\nthinking he had lost his millions eventually recovered the value of all,\r\nresented my prediction of evil as that of a false prophet. But that does\r\nnot greatly concern me. My memorandum was drawn up not in his interest\r\nas creditor but in that of his Egyptian debtors.\r\n\r\nAnother curious entry, 28th March, gives a hint of the ideas current in\r\nPrinting House Square. This was the first time I had been to the \"Times\"\r\noffice, and Button was again my _cicerone_. We saw there Macdonald, the\r\nmanager, with the object of trying to get him to send out a new\r\ncorrespondent to Cairo, who should give the \"Times\" independent news,\r\nand Mackenzie Wallace had been thought of for the purpose. But\r\nMacdonald, with Scotch caution, would not go to the expense. He was\r\nquite satisfied from a business point of view, he said, with the kind of\r\nnews Scott, their correspondent at Alexandria, was sending them. English\r\npeople, he said, had only two interests in Egypt, the Suez Canal and\r\ntheir bonds, if they held any, and Scott's views on these two matters\r\nwere what they wanted. Beyond this they did not care in any special way\r\nabout the truth. He complimented me all the same on my own letters,\r\nwhich as I was not paid for them they were obliged to me for, and they\r\nwould always be glad to print whatever more I had to say. But a special\r\ncorrespondent just then was not needed.\r\n\r\nI was in correspondence about this time with Allen, the Secretary of the\r\nAnti-Slave-Trade Society, a very worthy man but of extremely narrow\r\nviews. Sir William Muir had taken me to task in the \"Times\" for having\r\nasserted in one of my letters that it was part of the National program\r\nin Egypt to suppress what remained of slavery in Egypt, and he had been\r\nat the pains to prove by chapter and verse from the Koran, that slavery\r\nwas and must always be an institution of a religious character with\r\nMohammedans. Allen, too, I found indignant at the idea of Arabi's being\r\nactively in favour of its suppression, which he, Allen, seemed to\r\nconsider was the sole business of the Society's anti-slavery agents at\r\nCairo. His anger was very much what a master of foxhounds might express\r\nat the unauthorized destruction of foxes by a farmer. Mohammedans, he\r\nconsidered, had no business to put down slavery on their own account, or\r\nwhat would become of the Society. This at least was the impression his\r\nargument left on me.\r\n\r\nLastly, I find a note of having been asked, 1st April, to meet the\r\nPrince of Wales, who wanted to see me, at dinner, _en partie carrée_. My\r\nhost on this occasion was Howard Vincent, who was at that time on\r\nintimate terms with H. R. H. I was stupid enough not to go to the\r\ndinner, which would have been interesting. But I unfortunately had a\r\nprevious engagement for the same day to meet Princess Louise of Lorne at\r\nthe Howards, and did not like to break my engagement, which was also an\r\nimportant one. I went, however, in the evening to Vincent's and had some\r\ntalk with the Prince of Wales about Egypt, though not on the subjects\r\nconnected with it that most interested me.\r\n\r\nHere the first Act of my English campaign may be said to end. Up to this\r\npoint all, in spite of huge difficulties, had gone well with my\r\npropaganda. My preaching of the National Egyptian cause had been almost\r\neverywhere well received, and the talk of intervention had subsided. At\r\none moment my hopes were very high, for Button had ascertained that the\r\nCommission I had asked for was to be sent, and he named to me even the\r\nperson said to have been chosen. But, alas, it proved a vain rumour.\r\nThen everybody went out of London for the Easter recess, and before they\r\nreturned the news of the Circassian plot was upon us. It was the\r\nbeginning of the pitiful end.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[11] Since the above was in print I have lit on the following entry in\r\nmy diary of 1884, which at the same time confirms and corrects what is\r\nsaid of Paget's connection with this colony: \"Vienna, Sept. 20. Dined at\r\nthe Embassy. Sir A. Paget very amiable, talked about Egypt. He remembers\r\nNubar Abba's dragoman. He asked my opinion of Arabi, and I asked him in\r\nturn whether it was true that Ismaïl had told him that Arabi was in his\r\npay. He said he had never talked to Ismaïl about Arabi, but he remembers\r\nhaving heard that Ismaïl said, 'ce gaillard là m'a conté les yeux de la\r\ntête.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE CIRCASSIAN PLOT\r\n\r\n\r\nHow fair the prospects in Egypt still were in the first week of April,\r\nnotwithstanding the many rumours of disturbance there which were being\r\nspread through Europe, may be judged from the following two letters\r\nwritten to me at that time by Arabi, and still more by a third which I\r\nreceived at the same time from Sheykh Mohammed Abdu. Sheykh Mohammed\r\nAbdu's high character throughout his life for the strictest veracity and\r\nthe exalted position he now holds as Grand Mufti of Egypt, give to his\r\ntestimony a historical value which can hardly be exaggerated, and may\r\nwell be placed in accepted contradiction of the multiform falsehoods of\r\nthe Blue Books. His functions that spring as Director of the Official\r\nJournal and Censor of the Press at Cairo put him, moreover, in a\r\nposition of knowledge as to what was passing in the counsels of the\r\nNational Ministry, which neither Malet nor Colvin nor any European in\r\nEgypt could at all pretend to. I draw the special attention, therefore,\r\nof historians to these convincing documents:\r\n\r\n     \"Cairo, _April 1st, 1882_.\r\n\r\n     \"_To our respected, sincere, and free-minded friend, Mr. Wilfrid\r\n     Blunt, may God prosper his best projects._\r\n\r\n     \"After offering praise to God, the conqueror of the strong and the\r\n     upholder of truth, I beg to say that your letter dated March 10th\r\n     has reached me, and caused me an immense pleasure.

Free Englishmen should surely help those who are\r\n     striving for the independence of their country, for its reform, and\r\n     for the establishment of an equitable Government. Your praiseworthy\r\n     endeavours will, we do not doubt, secure for you an honourable name\r\n     with your countrymen, when they shall come to discover in what way\r\n     you have laboured to remove the veil of untruth which interested\r\n     men have spread before their eyes.\r\n\r\n     \"As to ourselves, we thank you for your good services as they\r\n     concern both Egypt and England, which country we hope will be the\r\n     most powerful friend to assist us in establishing good order on a\r\n     basis of freedom, and an imitation of civilized and free nations.\r\n     Please God, we shall soon see the success of your endeavours, and\r\n     we therefore consider your safe arrival home a good omen of\r\n     success.\r\n\r\n     \"With regard to the advice you kindly gave us we have to thank you\r\n     for it, and beg to say that we are trying our best to keep things\r\n     quietly and in order, because we consider it one of our most\r\n     important duties to do so, and we are endeavouring to succeed.

I avail myself of this fortunate occasion to repeat my\r\n     sincere thanks for your good endeavours. I consider it to be my\r\n     duty, and the duty of every pure conscience, even the duty of all\r\n     men, to thank you for your good services. In acknowledging benefits\r\n     the ties of friendship are strengthened, and so between nations. We\r\n     are extremely anxious to come to an understanding about the\r\n     friendship and mutual interests of ourselves and the Powers with\r\n     whom we are under engagements, for it is only through friendship\r\n     that those who have the rights in our country can enjoy the fruit\r\n     of treaties and contracts, which we consider it our duty to respect\r\n     and defend. If any rupture should take place, it would affect not\r\n     us only or principally, but all other Powers, and principally Great\r\n     Britain. No large-minded Statesman can fail to foresee the\r\n     advantage which must result to England from befriending us, and\r\n     helping us in our struggle.\r\n\r\n     \"As to the Control, you may rest assured it will not be hindered in\r\n     the discharge of its duty, according to the rights guaranteed it by\r\n     international treaties.

The military budget has neither\r\n     increased a para, nor decreased a dirhem. It stands just as it was\r\n     fixed on 21st December, 1881 in the time of Sherif Pasha. Hence you\r\n     may rest assured that the rumours you took the trouble to mention\r\n     are spread only by unscrupulous persons.

Nor had I any\r\nopportunity of seeing either him or Hamilton till the Easter recess was\r\nover at the end of the month. In the meanwhile events in Egypt had again\r\nbecome most critical through what is historically known as the\r\nCircassian plot, the news of which reached London in the third week of\r\nApril. I did not pay it much attention at the time, looking upon it as\r\nonly one of the many false rumours being printed. But it soon turned out\r\nto be serious enough, not only in itself, but especially as giving our\r\ndiplomacy the opportunity it had been waiting for of setting the\r\nKhedive in open quarrel with his Ministers. Malet was by this time\r\ncompletely subjugated by Colvin, and was henceforth guided in his action\r\nto the end by Colvin's Anglo-Indian suggestions.\r\n\r\nThe author of the conspiracy was without question the ex-Khedive Ismaïl.\r\nI know this, among other sources of information, from his then\r\nsecretary, Ibrahim Bey Mouelhi. The ex-Khedive from his retreat at\r\nNaples was still pulling the strings of his party at Cairo, and giving\r\nadvice through them to his son. His chief agent was one Ratib Pasha,\r\nwhom I remember hearing of in the previous autumn as among the worst\r\nenemies of the Nationalists, and it was through him that the plot was\r\nworked. The idea was to get up among the Circassian officers of the army\r\na reactionary movement against the fellahin. Arabi and the chief fellah\r\nofficers were to be assassinated, and a counter-revolution brought\r\nabout, which Ismaïl hoped might in the whirligig of things lead to his\r\nown restoration. I am convinced that there was never at any time the\r\nleast chance of this, but it will be remembered that Rivers Wilson\r\nbelieved in it as possible, and had, perhaps, even come round to\r\nthinking it financially desirable as an alternative to the utter\r\nweakness of Tewfik and his inability to support the Control. Tewfik, as\r\nusual, was halting between two courses, that of going on with the\r\nConstitutional Ministry and Arabi, of whom he was now profoundly\r\njealous, and that of joining the Turkish reaction at the risk of\r\nbringing back his father. Sherif and Malet were working together, and\r\nSherif's house had become a centre of the diplomatic intrigue against\r\nthe Ministry inspired by Colvin. I do not say that either Colvin or\r\nMalet, or even, perhaps Sherif, were cognizant of the intended blow, but\r\nit was well known that they would favour any party which should succeed\r\nin overthrowing the Ministry, and that gave confidence to the\r\nconspirators. The plot, however, was betrayed to Arabi before it had\r\ntime to come to a head, though not until an unsuccessful attempt had\r\nbeen made on Abd-el-Aal Bey, and the conspirators were promptly arrested\r\nand imprisoned. The details of the plot will be found, with other\r\ninteresting matter, in the following letter I received at the time from\r\nSheykh Mohammed Abdu, dated April 25th:\r\n\r\n     \"As to the promotions of the officers, of which European newspapers\r\n     are making so much talk, allow me to explain the facts. In the\r\n     first place, the promotions were not made by Arabi Pasha's sole\r\n     will and pleasure, nor were they a bribe to gain the officers'\r\n     affections towards Arabi. They were made in consequence of the new\r\n     military law, which prescribes that officers, after a certain age,\r\n     or sick, or infirm, or disabled, should retire from active service\r\n     with a pension. In Sherif Pasha's time this military law began to\r\n     take effect, and accordingly 558 officers were put on the retired\r\n     list. Next 96 officers were sent a year ago to the frontier of\r\n     Abyssinia, Zaila, and elsewhere, while 100 officers left the army\r\n     and took civil employ. The total number thus retired is 754. It was\r\n     thus natural that promotions should be made to fill up vacancies.\r\n     There are still fifty vacancies reserved for the cadets of the\r\n     Military School.\r\n\r\n     \"Arabi's title of Pasha was not forced on him by the Sultan, but by\r\n     the Khedive, who insisted that all his Ministers should hold that\r\n     rank.\r\n\r\n     \"Let me now dispel from all minds, once for all, the false idea\r\n     that Arabi, or the Military party, or the National party, are tools\r\n     of the Turks. Every Egyptian, whether he be a learned man (of the\r\n     Ulema) or a fellah, an artisan or a merchant, a soldier or a\r\n     civilian, a politician or not a politician, hates the Turks and\r\n     detests their infamous memory. No Egyptian can look forward to the\r\n     idea of a Turk landing in his country without feeling an impulse to\r\n     rush to his sword to drive out the intruder.\r\n\r\n     \"The Turks are tyrants who have left calamities behind them in\r\n     Egypt which still make our hearts sore. We cannot wish them back,\r\n     or wish to have anything more to do with them. The Turks have\r\n     footing enough with their firmans in Egypt. They must stop there,\r\n     and try nothing further. But if any attempt of this kind comes to\r\n     our knowledge, we shall hail it as a not altogether unwelcome\r\n     accident. We have had already some presentiment about this, and it\r\n     has been the cause of our preparations. We shall make use of the\r\n     event, if it happens, to recover our full independence. Our\r\n     clearest minded statesmen are now watching every movement of\r\n     Turkish policy in this country to check it the moment it oversteps\r\n     its limits. I do not deny that there are Turks and Circassians in\r\n     Egypt who advocate the cause of the Porte, but they are\r\n     few--nothing to those who love their country.\r\n\r\n     \"With regard to the Circassian conspiracy against Arabi Pasha's\r\n     life, it is not really a serious danger.\r\n\r\n     \"The ex-Khedive Ismaïl, the greatest enemy Egypt ever had, and one\r\n     still envious of her happiness, has long been mining us with plots\r\n     to destroy (blow up) our present Government, thinking in so doing\r\n     to prepare the way for his return. But God Almighty has scattered\r\n     to the wind his hopes, since every Egyptian knows that Ismaïl's\r\n     return means the ruin of Egypt. The tyrant (_Faraoun_), however,\r\n     hoping against hope, sent to Egypt one of his followers, Ratib\r\n     Pasha, who had been banished; and he, by underhand means in Sherif\r\n     Pasha's time, received admission to Egyptian soil, where he joined\r\n     his brother, Mahmud Effendi Talaat Beg-bashi, and later secured to\r\n     his service Yusuf Bey Najati, Mahmud Bey Fouad, Kosrow Pasha's\r\n     nephew and Otheman Pasha Rifki (all these are Circassians). These\r\n     worked to make converts to their plan, which was to destroy the\r\n     actual Ministers, and kill the superior officers of the army,\r\n     beginning with Arabi Pashi. Through their efforts, about forty of\r\n     the inferior officers joined their plan, swearing alliance, but at\r\n     first put off its execution for want of a pretext. This was found\r\n     in the discontent of nine Circassian officers, who objected to\r\n     being ordered for service to the Soudan. Ratib's party became aware\r\n     of what was going on among them, and took advantage of it to\r\n     suggest to the nine Circassians that they should refuse to go\r\n     except with promotion.\r\n\r\n     \"The Ministry has long had a suspicion of the mischief which was\r\n     impending. As long ago as when Ratib first returned to the country,\r\n     Mahmud Sami, the present Prime Minister when Minister of War,\r\n     requested Sherif Pasha, in the Khedive's presence, to expel Ratib.\r\n     He suspected something wrong in the fact that Ratib had left the\r\n     ex-Khedive so suddenly at Naples. But Sherif refused, although\r\n     Mahmud Sami warned him that he would be held responsible for all\r\n     that might one day happen. This because Ratib was Sherif's\r\n     son-in-law, and, as is thought, also perhaps his accomplice in the\r\n     design of restoring Ismaïl.\r\n\r\n     \"It happened, however, that Ratib's party invited a certain\r\n     Circassian officer, Rashid Effendi Anwar, to join them, and that\r\n     this officer refused to have anything to do with their plan, and,\r\n     leaving the conspirators where they were, came straight to Arabi\r\n     and disclosed the plot. Thus they were arrested, and brought to\r\n     trial by court-martial.\r\n\r\n     \"The event has caused little excitement among the common people.\r\n     Every one knows that Arabi's life is exposed as other men's, to\r\n     dangers daily. Nor is it possible for a man, however great he be,\r\n     that all should wish him well. But we should only laugh if it were\r\n     stated publicly that England was on the verge of anarchy because a\r\n     madman, soldier or civilian, had tried to shoot your Queen.\r\n\r\n     \"The Circassians in the army number in all eighty-one persons, and\r\n     no one in his senses need be alarmed at the chance of so small a\r\n     number of men succeeding against the Government.\r\n\r\n     \"Now, as to the Slave Trade. The present Ministry is trying hard to\r\n     suppress domestic slavery. The Mohammedan religion offers no\r\n     obstacle at all to this; nay, according to Mohammedan dogma Moslems\r\n     are not allowed to have slaves except taken from infidels at war\r\n     with them. In fact, they are captives or prisoners taken in legal\r\n     warfare, or who belonged to infidel peoples not in friendly\r\n     alliance with Mohammedan princes, nor protected by treaties or\r\n     covenants. But no Moslem is allowed to be taken as a slave.\r\n     Moreover, if a person is an infidel, but belongs to a nation in\r\n     peaceful treaty with a Mohammedan prince, he cannot be taken as a\r\n     slave. Hence the Mohammedan religion not only does not oppose\r\n     abolishing slavery as it is in modern time, but radically condemns\r\n     its continuance. Those learned gentlemen in England and elsewhere\r\n     who hold a contrary opinion should come here and teach us, the\r\n     Sheykhs of the Azhar, the dogmas of our faith. This would be an\r\n     astonishing spectacle. The whole Mohammedan world would be struck\r\n     dumb when it learned that a Christian had taken upon him the task,\r\n     in the greatest Mohammedan University in the world, of teaching its\r\n     Ulema, professors, and theologians the dogmas of their religion,\r\n     and how to comment on their Koran.\r\n\r\n     \"A Fewta will in a few days be issued by the Sheykh el Islam to\r\n     prove that the abolition of slavery is according to the spirit of\r\n     the Koran, to Mohammedan tradition, and to Mohammedan dogma.\r\n\r\n     \"The Egyptian Government will endeavour to remove every obstacle in\r\n     the way, and will not rest till slavery is extirpated from Egyptian\r\n     territory.\r\n\r\n     \"MOHAMMED ABDU.\"\r\n\r\nThe plot thus on the 25th of April seemed to be frustrated, nor would it\r\nhave led to any more serious complications but for the action taken by\r\nMalet in regard to it. Instead of supporting the Ministry against whom\r\nit had been directed, his official sympathies were given wholly to the\r\nconspirators. These had been tried by court-martial and condemned to the\r\nnot overwhelming punishment of being banished to the White Nile, a\r\npenalty constantly enforced in Egypt even in the time of the Dual\r\nControl. Malet, however, wrote home that the sentence was a monstrous\r\none, equivalent to death, while the \"Times\" correspondent was allowed to\r\npublish the story, an altogether false one, that Arabi had privately\r\nvisited the prison and there had had the conspirators tortured under his\r\neyes. That there was no truth in this tale it is hardly necessary to\r\naffirm. Yet Malet gave it a certain countenance in his despatches to the\r\nextent of mentioning it as a report prevalent, and that cries had been\r\nheard issuing at night from the prison. What is certain is that it was\r\nmade a pretext with him for encouraging the Khedive to quarrel with his\r\nMinisters by taking the case out of their hands into his own, and\r\ncommuting their sentence into one of simple exile, an act which\r\naccording to the new Constitution was beyond his right.\r\n\r\nTo go back to my journal in London, I find that on 28th April I went to\r\nDowning Street \"rather wroth\" about nothing having been done for Egypt,\r\nbut Hamilton bade me be patient and said that my idea of a Commission\r\nhad been taken up. Also, the next day, Button congratulated me on my\r\nsuccess. \"He tells me there has been a fearful crisis about Egypt; that\r\nthe Sultan was for sending troops there, deposing Tewfik, setting up\r\nHalim, and hanging Arabi. The English and French Governments, however,\r\nhave prevented this, and Arabi is to be supported and a Commission\r\nsent.\" On Tuesday there was to be a declaration of their Egyptian\r\npolicy in the House of Lords by the Government. This news of the\r\nSultan's intervention seems, in fact, to have been a crisis of the\r\nmoment brought on by the Rothschilds with the support of Bismarck. The\r\nrelations between Constantinople and the National Party in Egypt had\r\nbecome strained in the last few weeks through various circumstances\r\nwhich it is time now to explain, as well as the peculiar communications\r\nwhich passed in the month of February between the Sultan and Arabi,\r\ncommunications which are of the greatest possible importance in\r\nestimating Arabi's growing position of political power in Egypt superior\r\nto that of his fellow Ministers.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that when the Sultan's Commissioners visited Egypt\r\nin the autumn of 1881 Ahmed Pasha Ratib (not to be confounded with Ratib\r\nPasha, the ex-Khedive's agent), who was one of them and the Sultan's A.\r\nD. C., met Arabi in the train on his way to Suez and Mecca, and that\r\nthey had interchanged ideas and made friends, and that the Pasha had\r\npromised to represent him favourably to his master as a good Mohammedan\r\nand one loyal to the Caliphate. This had led to correspondence between\r\nthem, of which I have in my possession the originals of the following\r\ntwo important documents. They came into my hands, with a mass of other\r\npapers, at the time of Arabi's trial. The two letters were written\r\nwithin three weeks after the Government of Mahmud Sami was formed, in\r\nFebruary, 1882, in which Government Arabi was Minister of War. The first\r\nis from Ahmed Ratib, the second from Sheykh Mohammed Zafir, one of the\r\ngreat religious sheykhs of Constantinople, who at that time was charged\r\nwith the Sultan's secret correspondence; and both were written at the\r\nSultan's personal command.\r\n\r\n     \"TO THE EGYPTIAN MINISTER OF WAR, AHMED ARABI BEY\r\n\r\n     \"I related to His Majesty the Sultan the conversation we had on the\r\n     railway between the stations of Zagazig and Mahda on my return to\r\n     Constantinople, and it caused great pleasure to His Majesty, and he\r\n     ordered me to communicate to you his Imperial compliments. I\r\n     related to His Majesty all the kind treatment I received at your\r\n     hands and the courtesy my eyes witnessed while I was at Cairo, and\r\n     His Majesty was extremely gratified thereat, so that the\r\n     satisfaction he felt in your devotion and fidelity was increased\r\n     manyfold. People had made him think that you were acting, I know\r\n     not how, contrary to right, and had succeeded in perverting His\r\n     Majesty's idea about you, but now as I have exposed the true state\r\n     of the case to him, I swear to you that His Majesty deeply regrets\r\n     ever having paid any attention to these false and lying statements\r\n     about you; and as a good proof of this His Majesty has commanded me\r\n     to write this letter, and to express to you the sentiments which\r\n     follow:\r\n\r\n     \"It matters nothing who is the Khedive of Egypt. The thoughts of\r\n     the ruler of Egypt, his intentions and his conduct must be governed\r\n     with the greatest care, and all his actions must tend to secure the\r\n     future of Egypt and to uphold intact the sovereignty of the Caliph,\r\n     while he must show the most perfect faith in upholding the faith\r\n     and the country's rights. This will be required of him of the\r\n     persons who have been on the Khedivial Throne. Ismaïl Pasha and his\r\n     predecessors gave bribes to Ali Pasha, Fuad Pasha, Midhat Pasha and\r\n     their representatives of the Sublime Porte, traitors; and, after\r\n     shutting the eyes of the officials, dared to overtask and oppress\r\n     the Egyptians. And, in addition to this, they made heavy debts and\r\n     brought the Egyptians under a grievous yoke. And today, in the eyes\r\n     of the world, their state has specially appealed to our pity, but\r\n     the whole position is an extremely delicate one which calls for the\r\n     necessity of finding a speedy and sure remedy. Therefore it\r\n     behooves you above all things to prevent anything that might lead\r\n     to foreign intervention, and never to stray from the just and true\r\n     path nor to listen to any treacherous falsehoods, but in every way\r\n     with watchful care to hinder the seditious projects of foreigners.\r\n     This is the great hope of the Sultan.\r\n\r\n     \"And, since we two shall correspond in the future, you must take\r\n     necessary precautions to prevent our letters from falling into\r\n     strange hands. For this the easiest way at present, and there is no\r\n     safer channel you can find, is to submit your correspondence to the\r\n     true and trusty man who carries this letter and that of Sheykh\r\n     Mohammed Zafir.\r\n\r\n     \"I would also add that it is indispensable that you should send\r\n     secretly some officer who knows well what is going on in Egypt,\r\n     and who is a trusted friend of yours, to present at the footstool\r\n     of His Majesty the reports on the state of the country in true\r\n     detail.\r\n\r\n     \"I beg you to send the answer by the man who brings this letter.\r\n\r\n     AHMED RATIB, Aide-de-Camp of the Sultan.\r\n\r\n     \"_4th Rebi ul Akhar._ _22nd Feb., 1882._\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"_To His Excellency the Egyptian Minister of War._\r\n\r\n     \"I have presented your two faithful letters to His Majesty the\r\n     Sultan, and from their contents he has learnt all your sentiments\r\n     of patriotism and watchfulness, and especially have the promises\r\n     you make of your efforts to guard faithfully and truly His\r\n     Majesty's interests been a cause of lively satisfaction to His\r\n     Majesty, so much so that His Majesty ordered me to express his\r\n     pleasure and his favour to you, and further bade me write to you as\r\n     follows, viz.:--As the maintenance of the integrity of the\r\n     Caliphate is a duty which touches the honour of every one of us it\r\n     is incumbent on every Egyptian to strive earnestly after the\r\n     consolidation of my power, to prevent Egypt from passing out of our\r\n     hands into the rapacious grasp of foreigners as the Vilayet of\r\n     Tunis has passed, and I repose all my confidence in you, my son, to\r\n     exert all your influence and to put forth every effort to prevent\r\n     such a thing happening. And you are to beware never for one moment\r\n     to lose sight of this important point, and to omit none of the\r\n     precautionary measures which are called for by the age in which we\r\n     live, keeping all ways before you, as a perpetual goal, the defence\r\n     of your faith and of your country; and especially you are to\r\n     persist in maintaining your confidence and the ties which bind you.\r\n\r\n     \"That country (Egypt) is of the highest importance to England and\r\n     France, and most of all to England, and certain seditious intrigues\r\n     in Constantinople, following in the path of these Governments,\r\n     have, for some time past, been busy with their treacherous and\r\n     accursed projects, and, since they have found it to their profit\r\n     zealously to promote these intrigues and seditions in Egypt, it is\r\n     the especial desire of His Majesty that you should keep a very\r\n     careful eye on these persons (or things?). And, according to the\r\n     telegrams and news sent by the Khedive, Tewfik Pasha, one of this\r\n     party, we see that he is weak and capricious; and also it is to be\r\n     remarked that one of his telegrams does not corroborate another,\r\n     but they are all in contradiction (wound each other). In addition\r\n     to this I may tell you that Ali Nizami Pasha and Ali Fuad Bey have\r\n     spoken to His Majesty most highly in your favour, and Ahmed Ratib\r\n     Pasha also has repeated to His Majesty the substance of the\r\n     conversation he had with you in the railway carriage between the\r\n     stations of Zagazig and Mahda, and as His Majesty places the\r\n     greatest confidence in Ahmed Pasha, His Majesty desires me again\r\n     for this to express his trust in you, and to say that as he\r\n     considers you a man of the highest integrity and trustworthiness he\r\n     requires of you, above all things, to prevent Egypt from passing\r\n     into the hands of strangers, and to be careful to allow them no\r\n     pretext for intervention there.\r\n\r\n     \"The orders which Ahmed Pasha Ratib will receive on this head will\r\n     be separately communicated to you. Both my letter and that of Ahmed\r\n     Pasha Ratib, by order of His Majesty, have been written by one of\r\n     His Majesty's own private secretaries, and after we have affixed\r\n     our seals to the letters; we also put an extra seal on the\r\n     envelopes.\r\n\r\n     \"And, in a special and secret manner, I tell you that the Sultan\r\n     has no confidence in Ismaïl, Halim, or Tewfik. But the man who\r\n     thinks of the future of Egypt and consolidates the ties which bind\r\n     her to the Caliphate; who pays due respect to His Majesty and gives\r\n     free course to his firmans; who assures his independent authority\r\n     in Constantinople and elsewhere; who does not give bribes to a\r\n     swarm of treacherous sub-officials; who does not deviate one\r\n     hair's-breadth from his line of duty; who is versed in the\r\n     intrigues and machinations of our European enemies; who will watch\r\n     against them and ever preserve his country and his faith intact--a\r\n     man who does this will be pleasing and grateful, and accepted by\r\n     our great lord the Sultan.\r\n\r\n     \"If I have not entered into any further details in this letter of\r\n     mine, I beg you to excuse me because Ahmed Ratib Pasha only arrived\r\n     three days ago, and yet in that time, owing to his declarations of\r\n     your fidelity and true intentions, His Majesty has expressed his\r\n     full confidence in you. I only received the message I have just\r\n     given you yesterday. I hope to be able to send you by next week's\r\n     post a more detailed letter. In every case be careful not to let\r\n     any letter you send fall into strange hands but try to get a\r\n     special messenger, and, as for this time; it would be better if you\r\n     would send your answer by the hand of the man who brings this\r\n     letter.\r\n\r\n     \"Your Servant, MOHAMMED ZAFIR.\r\n\r\n     \"_4th Rebi ul Akhar, 22nd Feb., 1882._\"\r\n\r\nThese two letters are records of such high historical importance that if\r\never my memoirs come to be printed they should be annexed to them in\r\nfacsimile. They explain much of what happened later in June at the time\r\nof the Dervish Mission, and they prove that if Arabi took upon himself\r\nthen and during the months of the war the position in some degree of\r\ndictator in Egypt, it was not without ample justification from a\r\nMohammedan point of view, in the commands of the Caliph as head of his\r\nreligion to protect the province against Christendom. They show, too,\r\nwhy it was that in the month of August Abdul Hamid was so loath to\r\nproclaim him a rebel, and how absurd was the charge of rebellion brought\r\nagainst him at his trial.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it must not be assumed from this that Arabi had made\r\nhimself the Sultan's tool in anything that concerned the administrative\r\nindependence of his country. His position on this point was a firm one.\r\nHe hated the Turks, and would certainly have resisted in arms any\r\nattempt from Constantinople at military intervention. Of this Sheykh\r\nMohammed Abdu's letter is ample proof, and it is in harmony with all\r\nthat Arabi has himself told me. His position, therefore, at the Caliphal\r\nCourt was a changing and precarious one. He had strong friends there in\r\nAhmed Ratib and Mohammed Zafir, but he also had strong enemies. Sabit\r\nPasha, the Khedive's Turkish secretary, was especially one of them, and\r\nreported to Yildiz everything he could find against him. Thus, when the\r\narrest of the Circassian conspirators occurred, among whom were Osman\r\nPasha Rifki, and other important Turks, it is quite possible there was a\r\nwave of anger against Arabi in the Sultan's mind. But it does not seem\r\nto have lasted, and from the moment when it became once more a question\r\nof resisting Europe, Arabi again had the Sultan's approval. As between\r\nTewfik, the puppet of the Anglo-French Control, and Arabi the defender\r\nagainst the two Christian Powers of the independence of a Moslem state,\r\nthere could be no hesitation in the Caliph's sympathies.\r\n\r\nI think it is to be regretted that the Sultan's wish to depose Tewfik\r\nand set up Halim was not carried out. Though Arabi did not belong to the\r\nparty of Halim in Egypt, he would certainly not have opposed it after\r\nTewfik had gone over to the English against him, and it would have been\r\naccepted by a considerable number of respectable men in Egypt who knew\r\nHalim to be both more intelligent and more liberal in his views than the\r\nother. The Sultan's intervention, therefore, would have been a peaceable\r\none if he had refrained from sending an army to enforce it. On the whole\r\nit was probably the best solution. The French Government, however, were\r\nstrongly opposed to the immixture of the Sultan in Egyptian affairs, and\r\nour diplomacy at Cairo was pledging itself more and more every day to\r\nTewfik. All that came of the idea of Turkish intervention and of the\r\ncommission I had asked for, and which had been almost promised, was an\r\nabsurd compromise of the two things, in the shape of a proposal made,\r\nbut not insisted on, by Lyons to Freycinet at Paris, that a French, an\r\nEnglish, and a Turkish general should be sent to Egypt to \"restore\r\ndiscipline in the Egyptian army.\" Lord Lyons, be it remarked, had a\r\nspecial reason for taking Malet's view of the situation in Egypt in the\r\nfact that Malet had been for years his private secretary and devoted\r\nservant in the profession.\r\n\r\nNothing, therefore, was really done of what I had been told at Downing\r\nStreet to expect, not even those few words of goodwill in Parliament\r\nwhich Gladstone had begged Arabi to wait for. By a synchronism, tragic\r\nfor Egypt, the crisis at Cairo, so long worked up to, coincided exactly\r\nwith that other crisis which had also been impending in Ireland. There a\r\n_régime_ of threats and coercion under Forster, the Chief Secretary, had\r\nbeen tried all through the winter. Members of Parliament had been\r\nimprisoned without trial, and the arts of police despotism had been put\r\ninto more rigorous practice than for many years, and without any result\r\nof pacification. Gladstone had persuaded his Cabinet to try conciliatory\r\nmeasures. According to a secret arrangement made with Parnell, the Irish\r\nleader, while he was in gaol at Kilmainham, and known as the Kilmainham\r\ntreaty, Parnell and his political friend, Dillon, had been released;\r\nand, as a consequence, Forster on the 2nd of May resigned his office and\r\nattacked the Government for their pusillanimity in the House of Commons.\r\nThe very same day, 2nd May, had been fixed for a Ministerial statement\r\nabout Egypt, on a motion made by Lord De la Warr in the House of Lords,\r\nand I find the following entry in my journal:\r\n\r\n\"_May 2._--Met Lord De la Warr at the House of Lords. He took me in, and\r\nI expected to hear the promised statement about Egypt, but heard instead\r\nLord Granville's announcement of Mr. Forster's resignation in Ireland. A\r\ngood deal of excitement. Lord Granville seemed rather shy and badgered.\r\nLord Salisbury interrupted once or twice.... I heard Rosebery say a few\r\nwords in a very impressive and dignified manner, etc., etc. Egyptian\r\naffairs are put off as of no importance.\" Ireland for the next few weeks\r\ndrove out all English interest in Egypt, so much so that when on the 6th\r\nI took Mohammed Abdu's important letter, explaining the Circassian plot,\r\nto Morley, he refused to publish it on the ground of its length, and\r\nthat \"nobody cared about Egypt.\"\r\n\r\nThis, however, was but the first act of the coming tragedy. On the 7th\r\nLord Frederick Cavendish, a brother of Lord Hartington and an intimate\r\nfriend of Gladstone's, who had been appointed Chief Secretary in\r\nForster's place to carry out the new policy of conciliation, was\r\nassassinated at Dublin with Mr. Burke, the chief permanent official, by\r\nmembers of an Irish secret society, known as the \"Invincibles.\" These\r\nwere in reality quite unconnected with Parnell's Parliamentary party,\r\nbut the public did not discriminate between the two, and the result was\r\na universal cry for strong measures against all forms of rebellion. For\r\na moment Gladstone battled against this, and it was proposed to Dilke,\r\nwho, as an advanced Radical, was with Chamberlain at that time friendly\r\nto the Parnellites, that he should take the post of danger at Dublin and\r\ncontinue, as Cavendish's successor, the task of conciliating Ireland.\r\nBut Dilke did not like the look of things, and refused the post. It was\r\nfound difficult to get any one to accept it. What, however, decided the\r\nabandonment of the policy of conciliation was the attitude of\r\nHartington. He took the matter of his brother's death, which he felt\r\ndeeply, as a personal wrong to be avenged, and from that moment became\r\nthe most determined enemy of Irish Nationalism. Gladstone had to choose\r\nbetween resignation and the abandonment of his policy, and, seeing a\r\nmajority of his Cabinet against him, he chose the latter. Trevelyan was\r\nsent to Dublin and new coercive measures were resolved on. And so, too,\r\nas to Egypt. Up to this point, in spite of the unconciliatory views of\r\nthe Foreign Office, Gladstone, supreme in the Cabinet, had been able to\r\nput a veto on any active form of armed intervention. But now he found\r\nhimself out-voted, and Egypt, too, was thrown to the wolves. \"Look,\" his\r\ncolleagues seem to have said to him, \"where your policy of conciliation\r\nhas led us in Ireland.\" If I have been rightly informed, a policy of\r\ncoercion in Ireland and of intervention in Egypt was decided on at one\r\nand the same Cabinet in the second week of May. I quote some extracts\r\nfrom my Diary in illustration of the double situation.[12]\r\n\r\n\"_May 8._--In consequence of the ugly look of things in Egypt I have\r\nwritten an ultimatum to Gladstone begging him to relieve me of the\r\ndilemma I am in, caused by the Government's silence. I have said that I\r\nmust speak the whole truth if Lord Granville won't. All the world,\r\nhowever, is agog about Ireland. Yesterday came the astounding news of\r\nLord Frederick Cavendish's and Mr. Burke's murder at Dublin. At first it\r\nseemed as if the Government would have to resign, but to-day Parnell has\r\nwritten to disown all connection with the crime, and I think Gladstone\r\nwill be the stronger for it. On Friday when I was in the lobby of the\r\nHouse of Commons Artie Brand (the Speaker's son), who was there, pointed\r\nme out 'the three Irish conspirators' talking together. Parnell is a\r\ntall, good-looking man of about 32, with nothing of the murderer about\r\nhim. Dillon is tall and very pale and dark, and would do for Guy Fawkes\r\nin a cloak and dagger. They looked very much like gentlemen among the\r\ncads of the lobby.\r\n\r\n\"_May 11._--There is bad news from Egypt. The Khedive having refused to\r\nsign the Circassian sentences, Arabi has convoked the Chamber and they\r\ntalk of deposing Tewfik. I went at once to Downing Street and saw\r\nGodley, on whom I urged the necessity of Gladstone giving me an\r\nimmediate answer. Gladstone is away at Lord Frederick's funeral, and I\r\nhave agreed to wait till to-morrow for an answer; but Godley saw I was\r\nin earnest and promised it should be given. It is, of course, an\r\nunfortunate moment.\" I have a vivid recollection of Godley's sympathy on\r\nthis occasion. I was myself deeply moved. It seemed to me so tragic a\r\nthing that the whole fate of a nation and of the best hopes of reform\r\nfor a religion, both historic in the world, should depend on the\r\npossibility of securing the attention of one old man for half an hour,\r\nfor I felt sure I could again persuade him. I did not, of course, know\r\nthe exact position of the Cabinet, but Godley must have known, and he\r\nseemed almost as much to feel it, as myself. I know he all along\r\ndisapproved the Foreign Office policy in Egypt, and I think he felt\r\ndeeply the disgrace of Mr. Gladstone's share in it when, in spite of his\r\nMidlothian speeches, he came forward as the apologist of a war against\r\nOriental freedom in the interests of finance. Very shortly after his\r\nchief's change of policy he left his service for a permanent post\r\nelsewhere, and I have always fancied it was more or less in protest.\r\n\r\n\"_May 12._--Freycinet has declared he will not let the Turks intervene,\r\nso I feel easier.... Rode to George Howard's who approved my plan (of\r\npublishing the whole truth). I have all ready now ... and the 'Times'\r\nwill publish. It appears that Rothschild has been working hard with\r\nFreycinet to get the French Government to set up Halim instead of\r\nTewfik.... In the meanwhile all that has actually been done is to order\r\na fleet to be ready in a fortnight at Plymouth.... Saw Eddy Hamilton. He\r\npromises the answer to-night. The Howards are very angry with Dilke\r\nbecause he has refused the Chief Secretaryship for Ireland. 'He will\r\nlose caste by this.' They looked upon it as the shirking of a post of\r\ndanger, but it is quite possible that Dilke was better pleased to remain\r\nwhere he was, at the Foreign Office, pulling the strings for Granville\r\nin Europe. It would have been well for Egypt if he had accepted.\r\n\r\n\"_May 13._--Gladstone's answer has come; he cannot tell me any details,\r\nbut Lord Granville will speak on Monday, and he begs me to wait till\r\nthen. He only promises that the Liberal policy shall be in accordance\r\nwith Liberal doctrines. So I am satisfied. I have written (to Gladstone)\r\nto offer to go out as mediator between Arabi and the Khedive. I have\r\nsent the following telegram to Arabi: 'I entreat you have patience. Do\r\nnothing rashly or without Parliament sanction. Delay action against the\r\nKhedive. I am working hard for you, but must have time. There is real\r\ndanger.' At five o'clock I received an answer from Gladstone to say that\r\nhe supposed my last letter was written before the arrival of recent\r\nnews. I cannot understand what he means by that, as there is nothing in\r\nthe evening papers.... Late at night an answer from Arabi: 'Mai 13. Je\r\nvous remercie de vos conseils. Différend déféré aux délégués.\r\nTranquillité complète. Certainement aucune crainte pour Européens. Ahmed\r\nArabi.'\"\r\n\r\nThe true history of the crisis which had taken place that first\r\nfortnight of May at Cairo, as I afterwards learned it, was this. On the\r\nsecond, the Khedive finding himself pressed by Arabi, his Minister of\r\nWar, to sign the sentences of exile on the Circassian officers, some of\r\nwhom were His Highness's personal friends, called Malet to his counsels\r\nand received from him the advice, fortified by a promise of English\r\nsupport, that he should refuse his signature; and this must be\r\nconsidered the moment at which Tewfik first resolved to throw himself\r\nespecially upon English protection in his quarrel with his Ministers.\r\nMalet thereupon wrote an important despatch which is published in the\r\nBlue Books, extolling in high terms the character of the Khedive, as one\r\ndeserving the full confidence of Her Majesty's Government. The Khedive,\r\ntherefore, refused to sign, though constitutionally his signature to the\r\ndecision of the court-martial could not be withheld.\r\n\r\nThe refusal, aggravated by the fact, which at once became known, that it\r\nhad been suggested by a foreign Consul, angered the Nationalist\r\nMinistry, and letters were addressed by the Prime Minister, Mahmud Sami,\r\nto the members of the National Parliament requesting their attendance at\r\nCairo. This was no doubt an irregular proceeding, inasmuch as the\r\nParliament could only be legally summoned by the Khedive, and it gave\r\numbrage to some of the members who were also annoyed at being called\r\nagain to Cairo from their country homes at an inconvenient season of the\r\nyear. Nevertheless, a large proportion of them came in answer to Mahmud\r\nSami's letters, and though they had no formal sitting, decided at a\r\nmeeting held in Sultan Pasha's house to support the Ministers, and it\r\nwas resolved by forty-five to thirty, that, if Tewfik persisted in\r\nintriguing with the English and French Consuls against them, there was\r\nno other way than to impeach and depose him. Malet, however, having by\r\nthis time received a telegram of approbation from the Foreign Office,\r\nand finding the Khedive wavering, informed him that the English and\r\nFrench fleets had been ordered to Alexandria on a plea of protecting\r\nEuropean subjects. Upon this the Khedive sent for Sultan Pasha, the\r\nPresident of the Chamber, and exposed the situation to him, and so\r\nworked upon his fears, and upon a certain personal jealousy which he\r\nknew to have grown up in the Sultan's mind toward Arabi, that he\r\npersuaded him to take part with him, and trust to European support\r\nrather than run the risk of war. Sultan then, at a new informal meeting\r\nof the Deputies, declared himself on the Khedive's side against the\r\nMinisters, and obtained the adhesion of six other Deputies to his view,\r\nthough the large majority of them remained faithful to the Ministry. It\r\nwas at this juncture that my telegram to Arabi was received at Cairo,\r\nand it seems to have had some effect with Sultan, to whom it was\r\ndoubtless shown. But the English papers of the thirteenth asserted that\r\nthe Chamber had joined the Khedive against Arabi, and on the fifteenth\r\nthat Mahmud Sami had resigned. The following is from my journal.\r\n\r\n\"_May 14._--Sunday, at Crabbet. I see in the 'Observer' that Sultan\r\nPasha went yesterday to the Khedive to make terms between him and Arabi;\r\nso I conclude my telegram came just in time. The papers all say that he\r\nand the Chamber have sided against Arabi with the Khedive, but I will\r\nnot believe that till I hear further. What is likely is that Sultan\r\nPasha has been put out at the Chamber being invoked without a legal\r\nsummons, and at an inconvenient time of the year. The army has had too\r\nmuch influence in the Ministry not to have made itself enemies. There is\r\nprobably jealousy, but I do not believe in more. The whole thing has\r\ndoubtless been fostered by Colvin and Malet. and the Circassians have\r\nbeen encouraged by the idea of Turkish intervention. They have ordered\r\nships to Alexandria, which, if I am not mistaken, will have the effect\r\nof uniting all once more against the Europeans.\r\n\r\n\"In the afternoon a perplexing telegram from Abdu, 'Il n'y a pas\r\ndiscorde entre Sultan Pasha et le Parlement. Le loup (meaning the\r\nex-Khedive Ismaïl) dont participation dans le complot Circassian est\r\nsupposé dans ma lettre a Sabunji, est en effet complice. Différend\r\nprincipal est déféré aux délégués. Tranquillité publique n'est pas\r\nmenacée.'\"\r\n\r\nVan Benningsen, the distinguished Dutch judge, author, under the title\r\nof \"Un Juge Mixte,\" of one of the most valuable works about Egypt under\r\nthe Dual Control, was staying with me at Crabbet at the time, and I\r\nfound him an ardent sympathizer with the Nationalists.\r\n\r\nThe next day, 15th May, was that of the long promised explanation by the\r\nGovernment of their Egyptian policy, and I went up to London in high\r\nhopes of something good, being fortified by the telegram I had received.\r\nI was doomed, however, to a new disappointment. Though the matter of\r\nEgypt was discussed in the House of Lords, Granville had nothing better\r\nto promise the Egyptians than a repetition of the old menace of\r\nGambetta's Joint Note, and the statement, which I felt certain was\r\nuntrue, that the Deputies at Cairo and the whole country were supporting\r\nthe Khedive in his quarrel with his Ministers. This, then, was the\r\nfamous \"Liberal policy\" Hamilton had promised me. I felt myself absolved\r\nfrom all obligation of reticence towards Gladstone, who seemed to have\r\nplayed with and deceived me. I left the House of Lords as soon as I had\r\nheard the speech, in great anger, and resolved henceforth to act without\r\nfurther reference to prudence on my part or the Government's\r\nconvenience. After thinking the matter over during the night in much\r\nperplexity, I decided upon a bold step. I was resolved to defeat the\r\nintrigue I knew was going on. As soon as the telegraph offices were open\r\nin the morning, 16th May, I sent the following message to Cairo:\r\n\r\n\"To Arabi Pasha, Minister of War. Lord Granville states in Parliament\r\nthat Sultan Pasha and the Deputies have joined the Khedive against you.\r\nIf untrue, let Sultan Pasha telegraph me contradiction. United you have\r\nnothing to fear. Could you not form a Ministry with Sultan Pasha as\r\nPrime Minister? But stand firm.\"\r\n\r\n\"To Sultan Pasha, President of the Chamber of Deputies. I trust that all\r\nwho love Egypt will stand together. Do not quarrel with Arabi. The\r\ndanger is too great.\"\r\n\r\nAlso to each of the following Deputies: \"Butros Pasha, Abu Yusuf, and\r\nMahmud Pasha Falaki. Parti national, est il actuellement content\r\nd'Arabi? Le Gouvernement Anglais prétend le contraire. Si vous vous\r\nlaissez désunir de l'année, l'Europe vous annexera.\"\r\n\r\nAnd I sent the same last telegram to Mohammed Abdu, to Sheykh el\r\nHajrasi, and to Abdallah Nadim, the orator. All the eight telegrams were\r\nsigned with my name, and I knew that in thus sending them I was sure to\r\nincur the anger of the Foreign Office, if not of Mr. Gladstone, for it\r\ncould hardly be unknown to the Agency at Cairo, as messages sent by the\r\nEastern Telegraph Company were at that time pretty well common property\r\nthere. I was resolved, however, to run the risk of this, my only doubt\r\nbeing how to express succinctly the nature of the danger against which I\r\nwarned the Deputies. The words, \"Europe will annex you,\" seemed to me to\r\ndo this best, for though, perhaps, our Government had no immediate\r\nthought of annexation nor yet the French Government, the ultimate end\r\nseemed certain, and Colvin's words rang in my ears; nor do I think that\r\nthe event so far has otherwise than justified me. Then, having fired my\r\nshot, I went back to the country repose of Crabbet to wait for what\r\nshould happen. The answer came sooner than I at all expected, and that\r\nvery evening, as I was sitting down to dinner, I received the following\r\nfrom Sultan Pasha:\r\n\r\n\"Le différend qui existait entre le Khedive et les Ministres\r\ncomplètement disparu. Nous sommes tous d'accord à maintenir le repos et\r\nla tranquillité et à appuyer le Ministère actuel. Sultan.\"\r\n\r\nIn delight I telegraphed it at once to Gladstone, and to the \"Times\" for\r\npublication.\r\n\r\n\"_May 17._--To London again in the highest spirits, and on my way\r\nreceived new answers.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the Sheykh el Islam, el Embabeh:\r\n\r\n\"Le différend entre le Khedive et le Ministère est applani. Le Parti\r\nNational est content d'Arabi. Le nation et l'armée sont unies.\"\r\n\r\nAnother unsigned, but no doubt from one of the Deputies:\r\n\r\n\"Tout le pays avec Arabi and le Ministère Sami. Fellahs, Bedouins,\r\nUlemas, tous sont unis. Il n'y a qu'un seul d'entre nous qui soit contre\r\nla liberté Egyptienne et qui tache de fausser l'opinion publique.\"\r\n\r\nAnd a third of like character from Mohammed Abdu.\r\n\r\nMoreover, in confirmation of the glorious news, the morning papers\r\nannounced that in the afternoon of yesterday the Khedive, through Sultan\r\nPasha's mediation, had forgiven the Ministry. It was clear that I had\r\nwon a first diplomatic victory. With such powerful proofs in my hand, I\r\nwent with a light heart to Downing Street and showed my telegrams, and\r\nfound Hamilton and Godley, who congratulated me on my success. I told\r\nthem the telegrams I had sent had cost me £20, and Hamilton said they\r\nought to be repaid me out of the Secret Service Fund. Though this was,\r\nof course, said jokingly, it proves that, at least on Mr. Gladstone's\r\nside of Downing Street the result I had gained against the Foreign\r\nOffice was cordially approved. Moreover, as I had not seen Gladstone\r\nhimself, Hamilton and Godley advised me to write him another formal\r\nletter and press home my point against the Foreign Office, on the ground\r\nof their false information, and I agreed to do so, and spent the night\r\nat this work, having first arranged with Button that, if need should be,\r\nthe letter should be published in the \"Times,\" and in the meanwhile I\r\nsent Sultan a telegram begging him to congratulate the Khedive.\r\n\r\nThe morning, nevertheless, was to bring me a sharp reverse, if not yet a\r\ndefeat. At a very early hour, having slept in London at my then town\r\nhouse, 10, James Street, Buckingham Gate, I sent for the morning papers,\r\nand found in all of them a Reuter's telegram from Cairo giving the text\r\nof my telegram to the Deputies, the one ending \"Europe will annex you,\"\r\nas having been addressed by me to the Sheykh el Islam, and stating that\r\nthe Sheykh el Islam had since recanted the telegram he had sent me\r\nin reply. Also in the \"Standard\" there was a telegram from its\r\ncorrespondent at Cairo saying that he was authorized by Sultan Pasha to\r\ncontradict the telegram from him which had been published in the \"Times\"\r\nof yesterday, the same having been written under military intimidation.\r\nI consequently at once wrote a second letter to Gladstone, and sent him\r\nthe two by the same messenger before noon, with a note to Hamilton\r\nsaying, that I considered it necessary both should be published. I had\r\nfound Button at home, and had shown him the letters, which he promised\r\nshould appear in the morrow's \"Times.\" He was delighted with them, and\r\nassured me they would make a sensation.[13]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, though they had already been put in type, for I had left\r\ncopies of them with Button, the two letters were not published. The\r\nreason for this is given in my diary. At six o'clock I found a note from\r\nEddy Hamilton saying he would be at home all the afternoon, so I went to\r\nhim. He said he thought the telegram to the Sheykh el Islam an\r\nunfortunate one, and advised me strongly not to publish. \"I asked him\r\nwhat assurance he could give me that nothing violent was intended at\r\nAlexandria. He said he understood that the fleet going there only meant\r\nthe securing of the lives of British subjects. He did not think it at\r\nall likely there would be any demand made for the disbanding of the\r\nEgyptian army or any disembarkation of troops. Also he assured me that a\r\nCommission, such as I had proposed, would be sent to Egypt. I am quite\r\nsatisfied with this, and have sent David (my servant) to the 'Times'\r\noffice to stop the publication of the letters.\"\r\n\r\nI do not doubt that the assurances given me in Downing Street on this\r\noccasion were given in good faith, but they were soon belied by the\r\nForeign Office, and my silence as to the telegrams did me, from that\r\ntime forth, an injury with the public. The \"St. James's Gazette\" spoke\r\nof me that very evening as an \"incendiary,\" and other journals, seeing I\r\ndid not reply, followed suit. Their language re-acted on the Government,\r\nand doubtless also on Gladstone, though he knew the truth, which the\r\npublic as yet did not. I continued, it is true, my communications and\r\nvisits to Downing Street, but they became inevitably on a less and less\r\nintimate footing. For this reason I regret that I allowed myself to be\r\npersuaded, and that the letters did not appear, as had been arranged\r\nthat night, in the \"Times.\" Had they done so I cannot help thinking that\r\nthe fatal ultimatum of 25th May would not have been issued.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[12] See Lord Eversley's letter quoted in the Preface.\r\n\r\n[13] These two letters are practically embodied in my letter\r\nsubsequently published on June 20. See Chapter XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nINTRIGUES AND COUNTER INTRIGUES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of the next six weeks in Egypt, from the arrival of the\r\nEnglish and French fleets at Alexandria to the bombardment of the city\r\nis that of a desperate attempt by our diplomacy one way or another to\r\nregain its lost footing of influence, and failing that to bring about a\r\nconflict; and of a no less desperate and unscrupulous attempt by the\r\nForeign Office at home to force Gladstone's hand to an act of violence.\r\nIn all this there was far less of statemanship, or even financial\r\nintrigue, than of personal pique. The tone neither in the Chancelleries\r\nof Europe nor of the Stock Exchange was so urgent as to make a peaceful\r\ntreatment of the case impossible. France, under Freycinet, had withdrawn\r\nentirely from Gambetta's aggressive designs, and would readily have made\r\nthe best at any moment of a political situation by no means hopeless at\r\nCairo, while Germany and Austria, representing the financial interests,\r\nespecially of the Rothschilds, were for a repetition of the remedy found\r\nefficacious in 1879, the Sultan's intervention in the form of a new\r\nfirman, substituting Halim for Tewfik. This would have been an easy\r\nsolution of the quarrel which had arisen between Tewfik and his\r\nMinisters, and though not the ideal to which the Nationalist leaders\r\nlooked, would have been accepted by all parties as an ending of the\r\ncrisis. The other countries of Europe were for the most part in sympathy\r\nwith the National movement, Switzerland and Belgium strongly so, while\r\nItaly was so enthusiastic that at one time, in spite of the Government,\r\nwhich supported English policy, a corps of volunteers was being enrolled\r\nunder Menotti Garibaldi to help Arabi. It was only in England that\r\npublic opinion, worked upon systematically through the Press primed by\r\nour diplomacy, was at all excited or called for vigorous action.\r\n\r\nThe personal element in the struggle is easy to understand. Malet and\r\nColvin had committed themselves at the time of the change of Ministry in\r\nFebruary to an attitude of uncompromising hostility to the Nationalists,\r\nand any solution of the crisis which should leave these in power at\r\nCairo they knew would mean their own disgrace. Colvin would certainly\r\nhave had to follow his French colleague, de Blignières, into retirement,\r\nand Malet would have been removed to some minor post in the service\r\nwhere his blundering would have been of less grave consequence. The\r\nForeign Office, too, had its own _amour propre_ to save. Dilke was an\r\nambitious man, and did not mean to fail, and even old Granville, fond as\r\nhe was of his ease, had his public phrases to make good. Thus from the\r\nmiddle of May to the 11th of July, the date of the bombardment, we have\r\nthe spectacle of a series of diplomatic manoeuvres wholly indefensible\r\nby any valid plea of necessity, absolutely at variance with all the\r\navowed principles of Mr. Gladstone's Midlothian policy, and so cynically\r\nunscrupulous that I doubt if in the annals of our Foreign Office\r\nanything comparable to them exists.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in native Egypt, we see the National Party just\r\nat the moment when it had secured for the country the right of\r\nself-government and an existence of personal and civil freedom which it\r\nhad never before in all its history enjoyed, when its Parliament had\r\nmet, and after a first happy session had adjourned, when its mind was\r\nbusy with projects of reform and when the general desire was to rest and\r\nbe thankful, at peace with all the world, hurried from its attitude of\r\ncalm into a sea of apprehension from without, and of treachery, backed\r\nby foreign intrigue, from within. Three letters written to me at the\r\nbeginning of the crisis, the first two from Arabi himself, the third\r\nfrom that gallant old Swiss gentleman, John Ninet, who alone of the\r\nEuropean sympathizers with the National fellah cause remained on in\r\nEgypt and took part with the army during the war, will show what the\r\nearlier feeling in native Cairo was.\r\n\r\n     \"Cairo, _May 15, 1882_.\r\n\r\n     \"_To my dear and sincere friend Mr. Blunt._\r\n\r\n     \"Praise be to God, your letter of the 20th April duly reached me.\r\n     We have read it with great pleasure. Let us hope that the fruit of\r\n     your endeavour will soon be gathered. Indeed, every sound-minded\r\n     lover of freedom bears witness to your philanthropic efforts. My\r\n     pleasure was increased by learning from you that my two letters\r\n     reached you in a favourable hour. May God in his mercy give peace\r\n     to our minds, and better the condition of affairs, and lead us to\r\n     what he thinks for the good of our country.\r\n\r\n     \"As to the publication of my two letters I only wished to refute\r\n     the attacks made upon me by my enemies, those who accused me of\r\n     being a man extravagant in his ideas and seeking after despotic\r\n     power. These are mere calumnies, as you know full well. I like\r\n     better to remind you that as a member of the Egyptian Government I\r\n     am responsible as Minister of War for the acts of my office, as we\r\n     all are responsible for our departments. I have but one voice in\r\n     the Cabinet, and I act according to the policy imposed upon me by\r\n     the Prime Minister, as shown in the letter he presented to the\r\n     Khedive when he first formed the Ministry. You may reply upon my\r\n     truthful word that we are all of us in anxious watch over our\r\n     country, and trying to rule it according to just principles, and we\r\n     have made up our minds, by God's help, to overcome all\r\n     difficulties. If any among the European nations, who love mankind\r\n     and love civilization, will take us by the hand and help us in our\r\n     struggle, we shall be infinitely grateful to them. If not we have\r\n     to thank God only, who has been our support from the beginning.\r\n\r\n     \"As to the state of the country, it is in perfect peace. Our only\r\n     perplexity is caused by the lies published by unscrupulous men in\r\n     the European press.

They are also determined to keep their privileges\r\n     confirmed to them by the treaties of the Powers. And they will\r\n     never allow a tittle of these to be taken from them as long as they\r\n     have life. And they will also try their best to watch over European\r\n     interests and the lives of European subjects, their property and\r\n     honour, as long as these keep within the limits prescribed to them\r\n     by law.\r\n\r\n     \"We all endeavour to do our duty, and we trust in God in defending\r\n     our rights, and through His help we hope to obtain our purpose.\r\n     This is the welfare of our country and the peace of those who live\r\n     in it. We also trust in the justice of Europe that the Powers shall\r\n     not begin the attack upon us, but on the contrary that they may\r\n     behave wisely with us. Because this will really be better for the\r\n     success of their own wishes, and their interests in our country.\r\n\r\n     \"It will be better for Great Britain if she does not rely on her\r\n     representatives in this country, because they are persons who have\r\n     private motives, which they wish to serve.

It says:\r\n\r\n     \"My heart of an old Swiss patriot bleeds now at the most unjust of\r\n     all international interventions. The country is entirely united in\r\n     favour of its honest leader, sprung, like the fellahin, from the\r\n     _limon du Nil_ (the black mud of the Nile). The Egyptian people has\r\n     loyally accepted its debt contracted for it by an unscrupulous\r\n     despot, one who in sixteen years squandered more than three hundred\r\n     millions sterling to fill his own pockets, the pockets of the\r\n     diplomacy, high and low, and of the Semitic and Nazarene\r\n     usurers.... A peaceful revolution has been accompanied by and with\r\n     the will of the nation. Not a single act unbecoming a scrupulous\r\n     government has taken place during the great change effected. But\r\n     Europe, interested more in the dealers in stocks and shares than in\r\n     the aspirations of a people, sends her fleets. Why? Because the\r\n     Chamber of Representatives found it proper to claim the right of\r\n     discussing the Budget! Where is the crime?... Suppose a Minister of\r\n     your Queen, having a disagreement with her, were to receive news\r\n     that a powerful combined fleet of the Catholic Powers would go to\r\n     Ireland and pacify it? Even so the analogy is not complete. Egypt\r\n     is quiet. Not a European or Christian can complain. Would not the\r\n     position be intolerable?... Arabi is wise and tranquil, awaiting\r\n     the future like a sage of ancient times. The army, the country, the\r\n     towns are with him. The French Consul-General has been a silent\r\n     member. Sir E. Malet has been _cassant, parti pris inconciliant_,\r\n     sowing fear in Cairo, instead of reassuring the people. You have no\r\n     idea, my dear sir, of the abominable lies every day telegraphed to\r\n     the 'Times,' 'Standard,' 'Daily News,' by the telegraphic\r\n     agencies.... Well, never a word, not an insult from the\r\n     population--we have been and are as quiet here as an English\r\n     congregation on a Sunday in Regent's Park. The fleets are expected\r\n     to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nOther letters of a later date will show it in its later stages. The\r\nsupreme injustice of the attack being made on them by England, the\r\ncountry above all others which had been associated in their minds with a\r\ntraditional love of liberty and of those humanitarian doctrines of which\r\nshe had been the apostle, revolted men's minds and roused in them\r\nfeelings of anger foreign to their natural attitude. Under constant\r\nthreat of violence, now from England, now at English instigation from\r\nthe Sultan, and knowing not whom to trust and fearing everywhere\r\nbetrayal, it is not surprising that wild ideas prevailed even among\r\nthose who had been soberest hitherto in their expression. At the same\r\ntime it is not a little remarkable what few mistakes were made in action\r\nby the leaders under circumstances of such extreme and constantly\r\nchanging difficulty, and the closer one examines these the more they\r\nredound to their credit. Nothing but the desperate shifts of our agents,\r\nwhen one after another their treacherous expedients had failed them and\r\nthey found themselves faced with a disgraceful diplomatic defeat, to\r\nbring about a violent solution through the guns of the fleet, forced the\r\nEgyptians at last from their calm attitude and enabled our Foreign\r\nOffice to claim a victory.\r\n\r\nThis may be affirmed without attributing either to Arabi or to any other\r\nof the leaders qualities of a first-class kind. They were neither\r\ndiplomatists nor administrators nor soldiers at all to be compared with\r\ntheir opponents, and they were most of them quite inexperienced in the\r\narts of government and the subtleties of international usage. Arabi's\r\nbest quality, I think, was a certain dogged determination not to be\r\ndriven from the position he had originally announced, namely, that,\r\nwhile ready to be friends with all the world, it was his duty to defend\r\nhis country against all hostile comers. In this he rendered in those\r\nweeks an incalculable service to his fellow countrymen, which it is\r\nright they should be reminded of. Nothing is more certain than that, if\r\nArabi had been less obstinate than he was in refusing either for threat\r\nor bribe to leave Egypt, and if thereby the Egyptians had not fought,\r\nthe fellahin would still be the double slaves they were in 1880, slaves\r\nto their Turkish masters as well as slaves to Europe. What does any\r\npatriot suppose would have resulted from Arabi's compliance? Liberty in\r\nany form? A continuance of self-government? Foreign rule less strenuous\r\nthan now? Certainly, none of these things. What would have come to pass\r\nis very clearly shown by the _régime_ established at Cairo immediately\r\nafter the war. It would have been one of police despotism, espionage,\r\nand secret punishments, unmitigated by any further interest taken in\r\nEgyptian nationality by the moral sense of Europe. It is possible that\r\nas a matter of form a Chamber of Notables might have been allowed to\r\nremain in existence for a few sessions as what is called a consultative\r\nbody, but it would have been one wholly powerless and wholly discredited\r\nof patriotism. The Turco-Circassian rule would have been ruthlessly\r\nre-established, and the Financial Control, reinforced with new political\r\npowers and exercised entirely in financial and European interests, would\r\nhave had neither the will nor the power to enfranchise the fellahin from\r\ntheir Turkish masters, themselves the slaves of Europe. The whole legend\r\nof fellah nationality would have vanished in a disgraceful smoke, for a\r\nnation which has never dared fight for its existence is justly despised.\r\nThe native press would have been reduced to the condition we find it in\r\nin Tunis. There would have been neither civil nor personal liberty, nor\r\nany regard paid to native rights. It would be still, in fact, what Egypt\r\nwas in 1883, a land where no man could speak above his breath or count\r\non his next door neighbour not to betray him. Arabi at least saved his\r\ncountrymen from this, and, if when it came to the point of actual\r\nwarfare he was found incapable as a soldier, they still owe him as a\r\npatriot much. He prevented them from incurring the supreme disgrace of\r\nnot having fought at all on the only occasion in all their history when\r\nthe chance was theirs to stand up for their freedom.\r\n\r\nHaving said this much, I will return to my story. The true history of\r\nthe telegrams, as I afterwards learned it, at Cairo was this. They had\r\narrived at a most critical moment when the attitude of the Deputies and\r\nof some among the weaker-kneed of the other civilian leaders was\r\nexceedingly doubtful. Malet had persuaded the Khedive to take heart and\r\nquarrel with his Ministers, and the Khedive had persuaded Sultan Pasha\r\nto join him partly by working on his jealousy of Arabi, for he was\r\ndisappointed at not having been included by Mahmud Sami in the Ministry\r\nof February, partly by informing him that the English and French fleets\r\nwere on their way to Alexandria. And Sultan, in his turn, had persuaded\r\nthirty, as against forty-five, of the Deputies. So that Malet had been\r\nable to telegraph to the Foreign Office that the Chamber was supporting\r\nthe Khedive. My telegrams, however, had given new heart to waverers and\r\nhad put such pressure upon Sultan that he had gone at once to the\r\nKhedive (who was engaged in drawing up a new list of Ministers under the\r\nPresidency of Mustafa Pasha Fehmi, the colourless Minister of Foreign\r\nAffairs) and effected a reconciliation between him and Mahmud Sami. The\r\nministerial crisis was considered by everybody at an end. Hardly,\r\nhowever, was the arrangement made than it was undone. Malet, having got\r\nwind of the telegrams, sent for Sultan Pasha, and partly by threats\r\nabout the fleet, partly by promises, once more persuaded him to take\r\nsides with the European Control.\r\n\r\nSultan Pasha, who afterwards deeply regretted his defection from the\r\nNational cause at this critical moment, always affirmed that Malet, to\r\nwin his support, gave him his word of honour that day that the rights of\r\nthe Egyptian Parliament would be respected; and I have been told by his\r\nfriends that Sultan died reproaching himself that he had been fool\r\nenough to believe him. Nevertheless, with the exception of Sultan,\r\nnobody of any importance among the Deputies allowed himself again to be\r\ndetached from the National cause. All who had received my telegrams\r\nbelieved me rather than Malet, and Arabi's hands had been immeasurably\r\nstrengthened when ten days later the next great crisis came. Malet's\r\ncoup with the fleet had been discounted, and it ended in a complete\r\nfiasco. The sending of the fleet had been intended by Lord Granville as\r\na _brutum fulmen_, which was to effect its purpose without real\r\nviolence, a method in which he greatly believed and of which his success\r\nthe year before at Dulcigno in the matter of the Greek frontier had\r\nspecially enamoured him--indeed, it was one of his maxims that \"a threat\r\nis as good as a blow.\" Malet also, who knew Lord Granville's mind,\r\ncounted at that time on a bloodless victory. He throughout miscalculated\r\nthe power of the National sentiment; and it was only when he saw that he\r\nhad failed diplomatically that, following Colvin's lead, he prepared for\r\nforce. The dates are: May 17th, Malet finally secures Alexandria. May\r\n25th, Malet and Sinkiewicz issue their ultimatum, stating that it has\r\nbeen suggested to them by Sultan Pasha. It demands the resignation of\r\nthe ministry and Arabi's retirement from Egypt. May 27th, the Mahmud\r\nSami Ministry resigns. May 28th, Cairo rises and insists upon Arabi's\r\nreinstatement as Minister, and Arabi is reappointed Minister of War with\r\nsomething like dictatorial powers.\r\n\r\nIn England during all this crisis the outlook for me was a black one,\r\nmade darker by the unfortunate defection, just at the moment when his\r\nsupport was most needed, of my fellow champion of the Egyptian cause in\r\nLondon, Sir William Gregory. Gregory had committed himself quite as\r\ndeeply to the National Party in its earlier stages as I had, and had\r\nwritten a number of powerful letters in support of Arabi in the \"Times,\"\r\nand his influence stood far higher than mine in official quarters and\r\nwith Chenery, the \"Times\" editor. The prospect, however, of possible\r\nhostilities in connection with the arrival of the fleets alarmed him,\r\nand he had latterly begun in his letters to doubt and qualify his\r\npublished opinions. Since leaving Egypt in April he had been travelling\r\non the Continent and I had been hoping daily for his arrival in London\r\nto reinforce my pleadings with the Government. Instead of this, I found\r\nto my dismay that, if not exactly against us, he was doing us little\r\nservice. We were to have gone together to an anti-aggression meeting but\r\nnow he refused to go. I find in my journal:\r\n\r\n\"_May 19._--Gregory has failed us. He dined last night with Chenery who\r\nhas frightened him, and he refuses now to go to the meeting. I went to\r\nthe meeting and made my speech and answered a number of questions put to\r\nme, giving the true history of the telegrams, and I got Dilwyn, the\r\nchairman, to vote my conduct patriotic.\r\n\r\n\"_May 20._--I hear Lord Granville is furious with me about the\r\ntelegrams.\"\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, 21st May, the very next day, after this entry, I had an\r\nembarrassing meeting with Granville. I had been asked with my wife some\r\ntime before by her cousin, the present Lord Portsmouth, to spend that\r\nSaturday to Monday at Hurstbourne, and the Granvilles had also been\r\nasked and several other persons more or less political. I fancy\r\nGranville had wished to meet me, as it is called \"accidentally\" in\r\ndiplomatic parlance. But in the interval grave events had taken place,\r\nand I was not a little disturbed when I found him staying there, for I\r\nhad not myself been told of it. The moment was an unfortunate one, for\r\nthat morning we had brought down with us the \"Observer\" newspaper which\r\ncontained an account of the first rebuff given to the fleet at\r\nAlexandria. \"We arrived with Lowell, the American Minister, and found\r\nthe house empty, every one gone to morning church. On their return I\r\nperceived to my horror, for I was not expecting it, Lord Granville and\r\nLady Granville walking back with the rest of the party. Things however\r\nwent off well, for I had the sympathy of most of the party with me,\r\nespecially as we had brought news down with us that the arrival of the\r\nfleets at Alexandria had been resolutely answered by Arabi by a call to\r\narms, and that 4,000 of the Redifs (reserve men) had responded to it.\r\nHis Lordship looks worried, so I argue well for the Nationalists. I had\r\na deal of conversation with him on every subject in the world except\r\nEgypt. Lord Granville is very pleasant company, a _raconteur_ of the\r\nold-fashioned type, each story being neatly and concisely got up, not\r\nalways apposite to the moment but almost always good. With the rest of\r\nthe party Egypt was gaily and sympathetically discussed. Henry Cowper\r\nwas charming--Lowell and Stuart Rendall most sympathetic--the last, that\r\nis, when Lord Granville was out of hearing.... It was a lovely day and\r\nwe sauntered about the park and gardens, Henry Cowper telling good\r\nstories, amongst others one, _à propos_ of the Eastern Question, of\r\nDisraeli. He had heard him say 'Tancred is a book to which I often\r\nrefer, not for amusement but for instruction.'\" Lowell, as already said,\r\nwas the whole of that summer a strong believer in the National Party,\r\nand always gave me support in conversation about it when we met.\r\n\r\nIt is worth noticing in connection with this visit to Hurstbourne that\r\nLord Granville two days later, 23rd May, sent the fatal telegram\r\nauthorizing Malet to \"act as he thought fit,\" with the result that the\r\nUltimatum was issued on the 25th. The view of the case in Egypt as\r\nprinted at that date by John Morley in the \"Pall Mall Gazette,\" runs\r\nthus: \"Affairs still remain in a very critical condition at Cairo.\r\nOurabi[14] persists in maintaining an attitude of defiance. He is\r\nplaying his last card. The reserves are being brought up from the\r\nvillages--in chains--troops are being hurried to the coast to resist a\r\nlanding and artillerymen are being sent to the ports at Alexandria, the\r\nguns of which, such as they are, surround our ironclads. All this,\r\nprobably, is only a game of brag, intended to extort better terms for\r\nhimself.\" \"The experiment,\" says Morley, \"of vigorous representations\r\nemphasized by ironclads at Alexandria has been fairly tried, and there\r\nseems to be no doubt that it has completely failed.\"\r\n\r\n\"_May 22._--To London. Harry Brand, whom I met at the Club, tells me\r\nDilke tells him 'it must end in intervention.'\r\n\r\n\"Old Houghton sent to say he wished to consult me about Egypt, and I had\r\na long talk with him in the Lobby of the House of Lords.... I advised\r\nhim, if he was pushing the Government to land troops in Egypt, to send\r\nat once for his daughter home.\r\n\r\n\"_May 23._--Lord Granville in the Lords has made a jocular answer to\r\ndemands for information about Egypt.\r\n\r\n\"_May 26._--Gladstone has spoken about Egypt, a long rigmarole of which\r\nthe only thing remarkable is that he expresses his confidence in a\r\npeaceful solution.... The Consuls have delivered an Ultimatum stating\r\nthat their object is to restore the Khedive's personal authority and\r\ndemanding the exile of Arabi.\r\n\r\n\"_May 27._--Sultan Pasha denies having suggested the terms of the\r\nUltimatum.... The Ultimatum is refused.... Saw Gregory. We think the\r\nEgyptians will have to fight now, and I feel I ought to go out and join\r\nthem.... Telegram in the evening papers that Arabi's Ministry has\r\nresigned.\r\n\r\n\"_May 28._--Sunday at Crabbet. Things all seem gone to ruin in Egypt. I\r\nsuppose the Khedive's personal authority under the Control will now be\r\nrevived. If Arabi leaves the country and the army is disbanded, or\r\nreorganized under Circassian officers, Egypt may bid good-bye to\r\nliberty. She will share the fate of Tunis. Vicisti O Colvine!\r\n\r\n\"_May 29._--I could not sleep but began roaming about soon after 3. It\r\ntormented me to think I did not go to Egypt immediately on hearing Lord\r\nGranville's speech. I might have saved matters.... Now all is bright\r\nagain. By an extraordinary transition the papers announce that Cairo has\r\nrisen and has demanded Arabi's recall as Minister of War, the Khedive\r\nacquiescing. The news seems too good to be true, but it cannot be\r\ndoubted from the anger of the newspapers. This shifts things back into\r\nmore than their old place, and now there is nothing to fear except from\r\nthe Porte. I have made up my mind to go at once to Egypt. Went up to\r\nLondon, saw Gregory, lunched with the Howards, and wrote a letter to\r\nEddy Hamilton announcing my intention. Mrs. Howard advises me to trust\r\nall to Gladstone, and in my letter to Hamilton I have done so\r\nimplicitly. Only it is a wrench to leave England in June and face the\r\nturmoil and the heat of Cairo. I am happier though, feeling that at\r\nleast I am doing all I can do and doing my duty. Anne will go with me.\"\r\n\r\nMy letter to Hamilton, written under the influence of the Gladstonian\r\natmosphere of Palace Green, runs thus:\r\n\r\n     \"_May 29th, 1882._\r\n\r\n     \"DEAR EDDY,\r\n\r\n     \"Though Mr. G. is, I fear, displeased with me for the telegrams I\r\n     sent to Egypt a fortnight ago, I do not wish to take any important\r\n     step without his knowledge. I am convinced that some day he will\r\n     forgive me for what I have done, and approve what I intend to do;\r\n     and I have perfect confidence in him that he will act towards Egypt\r\n     on the Liberal grounds you spoke of, as soon as he is certain of\r\n     the truth. I believe, also, that I may still be of use to England\r\n     as well as to Egypt in circumstances which may occur; and with that\r\n     idea, I am going, unless anything unforeseen occurs, next Friday to\r\n     Cairo.\r\n\r\n     \"I will tell you exactly what I shall advise the National leaders.\r\n     I shall urge them, first of all, to sink all petty differences in\r\n     the presence of a great danger. I shall urge them, as I have always\r\n     done, not to quarrel with the Khedive; and if I have an opportunity\r\n     I shall urge the Khedive not to allow himself to be persuaded by\r\n     the Consuls to quarrel with the people. I shall fortify Arabi in\r\n     his determination to retain the full direction of the army in his\r\n     hands by remaining Minister of War, but shall advise him to leave\r\n     all other offices of State to civilians, and especially to members\r\n     of the Chamber. I shall urge the Egyptians to keep on the best\r\n     terms they can with the Sultan, short of admitting his soldiers\r\n     into their country, and on the best terms with the European Powers\r\n     short of yielding their constitutional rights. At the same time, I\r\n     shall advise them strongly, as I advised them last January, to\r\n     yield something to the Controllers of their present claim regarding\r\n     the Budget--that is to say, to postpone their rights at least for\r\n     this next year. I shall explain to them the position, as far as I\r\n     understand it, of the English Government, anxious not to destroy\r\n     their independence, yet bound by ties contracted by their\r\n     predecessors; of the French Government, traditionally inclined to\r\n     push its powers in the Mediterranean, and forced on by the\r\n     financiers; of the German Government, willing to divert the French\r\n     from home affairs and dissolve the English alliance; and, lastly,\r\n     of the Sultan, with his Caliphal dreams, a matter which they\r\n     probably understand at least as well as I do.\r\n\r\n     \"I do not propose myself to take any part in military operations,\r\n     should such occur, except in the last necessity, against the Turks,\r\n     for I know nothing of military matters, and have a horror of war.\r\n     But I shall urge the Egyptians to resist invasion, from whatever\r\n     quarter, and, if vanquished, to pursue a persistent policy of\r\n     refusing taxation not sanctioned by their laws--whereas, if\r\n     unmolested, I would have them pay their debt to the last farthing.\r\n     I shall have no need to repress fanaticism, for they are not\r\n     fanatics; but I shall join my voice to Arabi's in favour of the\r\n     humanest interpretation of the laws of war. I also wish to be at\r\n     hand in case of need, to protect European residents at the first\r\n     outbreak of hostilities.\r\n\r\n     \"I do not think I am acting unadvisedly in telling you this. My\r\n     idea of a policy for the Egyptians is, that they should act by a\r\n     rule diametrically opposite to the common Oriental ones. I would\r\n     have them tell the truth, even to their enemies--be more humane\r\n     than European soldiers, more honest than their European creditors.\r\n     So only can they effect that moral reformation their religious\r\n     leaders have in view for them.\r\n\r\n     \"I am, yours affectionately, W. S. B.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Pall Mall\" utterances of this date are again worth quoting, as they\r\nshow the absurdly unreal view of the situation in Egypt put forward at\r\nthat time by the Foreign Office, Colvin, Dilke, and the rest. Malet's\r\ndespatches had led the Foreign Office to believe that Arabi had behind\r\nhim no popular following outside the army, that the Khedive was in\r\nreality beloved by his subjects, and it was thought that it only needed\r\nnow a little additional show of outside help from Constantinople being\r\nat hand to bring about a manifestation in Tewfik's favour which, if it\r\ndid not force the army to submission, would lead to civil war demanding\r\nintervention.\r\n\r\nThe \"Pall Mall Gazette,\" 26th May, says: \"The Ultimatum which England\r\nand France have addressed to the Egyptian Ministry is to be accepted or\r\nrejected in twenty-four hours. This afternoon, therefore, the crisis\r\nought to be over and the order despatched to Constantinople for the\r\nOttoman _gens d'armes_ who are to restore the authority of the Khedive\r\nunder the control of England and France.\" Again, on 27th May: \"A few\r\nhours may decide whether the crisis in Egypt is to be solved peacefully,\r\nor whether the country is to be the scene of civil war and foreign\r\noccupation. The Ministry has resigned, and so far the terms of the\r\nAnglo-French Ultimatum have been complied with.... On the other hand it\r\nis at least likely that Ourabi ... may throw off the mask and declare\r\nboldly against his head.\" The kind of civil war expected is explained\r\nnext day, 28th May: \"Last night the Khedive slept at the Ismaïlia palace\r\nsurrounded by twelve thousand loyal Bedouins. The presence of these\r\nchildren of the desert in the Capital of Egypt constitutes a material\r\nsafeguard against a new _pronuncia mento_. No doubt it is a fearful\r\nprospect, that of a civil war in the streets of Cairo between the\r\nBedouins and the regular army; but its possibility is a security for a\r\npacific solution of the crisis.... Ourabi's position is no longer what\r\nit was. Even the power of the sword is no longer exclusively in his\r\nhands. If the Khedive with the swords of the Bedouins, the ironclads of\r\nEngland and France, and the support of the Chamber of Notables cannot\r\nreduce Ourabi to submission, the position must be more hopelessly\r\ncomplicated than any one has hitherto ventured to affirm.\"\r\n\r\nWhat a fantastic account! Twelve thousand loyal Bedouins camped round\r\nthe palace of Ismaïlia! The Chamber of Deputies devoted to the Khedive!\r\nArabi standing alone intimidating them all! Yet it was with these lies,\r\nof which honest John Morley was made the popular mouthpiece, that\r\nGladstone was being persuaded to apply the astonishing remedy for unruly\r\nEgyptian Nationalism of bringing in on it the \"unspeakable Turk,\" the\r\n\"Bashi-bazouk,\" fresh from his \"Bulgarian atrocities,\" and the \"man of\r\nsin\" himself, Sultan Abdul Hamid. The illusion of the Khedive's\r\npopularity only lasted forty-eight hours. Then we read in the \"Pall Mall\r\nGazette\" of 30th May: \"The time has at last come for immediate action in\r\nEgypt. The Khedive is a prisoner in his palace. The twelve thousand\r\nBedouins who were reported to be encamped around their sovereign have\r\nvanished into thin air,\" etc., etc.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I was awaiting an answer from Downing Street, and making my\r\npreparations for an immediate start for Egypt. Mr. Gladstone was out of\r\ntown, staying with Lord Rosebery at the Durdans, in my eyes an ominous\r\ncircumstance. I knew Rosebery's view of the Egyptian question, for a few\r\nweeks before I had found him at Downing Street with Hamilton, and had\r\nwalked with them both by the little garden exit through St. James's\r\nPark. On the way I had asked him his views about Egypt, and he had\r\nanswered very briefly, \"I have no views at all but those of a\r\nbondholder.\" He was, in fact, through his wife, a Rothschild, largely\r\ninterested in the financial aspect of the case; and I looked upon\r\nGladstone's visit to him just then as an evil symptom. Rosebery was not\r\nas yet in office, but had influence with Gladstone, and I knew through\r\nButton that he was being pushed forward by the Rothschilds to do their\r\npolitical work for them. This continued for some years, and his mission\r\nto Berlin in 1885 was suggested and made successful by the Rothschilds,\r\nand later at the Foreign Office he worked consistently in their\r\ninterests on Egyptian questions, though I have heard that before taking\r\noffice he got rid of his Egyptian stock.\r\n\r\n\"_May 30._--No answer from Eddy. I see Mr. G. is out of town at the\r\nDurdans. All however is going on well in Egypt, Arabi the acknowledged\r\nmaster of the situation.... I found a note yesterday from Houghton\r\nasking again to see me, and I went to him at his house in Mayfair, and\r\ntold him of my plan of going to Egypt. By his manner I am convinced that\r\nhe has been commissioned by Lord Granville to sound me.... I have told\r\nGlyns (my bankers, Messrs. Glyn, Mills, and Currie) to get me £1,000 in\r\nFrench gold, the sinews of war. I feel very loath to go, but happy,\r\nbeing sure that I am doing what is right.... Sabunji will go too....\r\n\r\n\"_May 31._--To London early and found another note from Houghton saying\r\n'surely I won't go.' I am certain this is an unofficial hint.\"\r\nHoughton's note was characteristic: \"My dear Blunt, assuredly you had\r\nbetter not go to Egypt just now. Whatever you say or do there will be\r\nexaggerated and probably misinterpreted. The alliance between the\r\nMilitary Party and the Porte seems complete, and that won't suit your\r\nviews. You could let me know if you hear anything precise. My daughter\r\nis still at Alexandria, but I am anxious for Fitzgerald, who must be\r\nobnoxious to the army from his military economies. I am yours very\r\ntruly, Houghton. Bring your friend (Arabi) back with you if you do go,\r\nand come and dine here with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Also a telegram from Eddy. 'Your letter received. I implore you to do\r\nnothing till after seeing me. Shall be back this evening.' He is at\r\nSalisbury.... At half past five found Eddy in Downing Street. He\r\nimplored me not to go, as my position in Egypt, and my known connection\r\nwith Gladstone would be misunderstood, and make a terrible row. He\r\npromised me there would be no landing of troops or intervention at all.\r\nOn this assurance I consented not to go. I told him, however, that I\r\nhoped they would not consider me responsible for accidents which might\r\noccur, and which it was my main object in going to prevent. He said they\r\nwould not.\r\n\r\n\"A large card has come from Lady Granville inviting us to the Foreign\r\nOffice on the 3rd to celebrate the Queen's birthday. I shall keep this\r\nas an answer to Harry Brand's charge of treason.... Now I am quite\r\ncontented. Sabunji is to go instead of me, and will do just as well. He\r\nhas telegraphed by my orders to Arabi in answer to a letter I have\r\nreceived from him: 'Letter received. Do not fear the ships. No\r\nintervention. Issue public notices in every town for the safety of\r\nEuropeans.' This in accordance with a suggestion of Eddy's.\r\n\r\n\"_June 1._--Everything seems going on beautifully. Arabi acknowledged\r\nmaster of the situation in Egypt. The Sultan supposed to be so at\r\nConstantinople. Button thinks the 'Times' will pay for my telegrams\r\nSabunji may send them. If so, so much the better. I have agreed to give\r\nSabunji £30 a month and his expenses.... Went to the House of Commons\r\nwith Nigel Kingscote (the Prince of Wales's equerry), who got me into\r\nthe Speaker's Gallery. Gladstone was giving his announcement of a\r\nconference at Constantinople as the upshot of it all. No troops are to\r\nbe mobilized in India, and no troops to be landed in Egypt. He considers\r\nsuch a course would endanger European lives. McCoan, an M. P., formerly\r\neditor of the 'Levant Herald,' asked whether it was true I was 'about to\r\nproceed to Egypt to put myself at the head of the insurrection.' Dilke\r\nanswered that he believed I had 'relinquished my intention.' Gladstone\r\nthen made the astounding statement that Arabi had 'thrown off the mask,'\r\nand had threatened to depose the Khedive and put Halim on the throne of\r\nEgypt. This is too absurd, but it is playing into my hands, because the\r\nstatement must be at once disproved, and the fact of its having been\r\nmade will show how ignorant the Foreign Office are. Gladstone will now\r\nprobably be angry with Malet for having led him into such a blunder.\r\nFrank Lascelles, however, who walked home with me from the House, tells\r\nme he has seen Malet's telegram respecting this, and all it says is that\r\nthe Khedive told him this, and he does not vouch for its truth. So are\r\nthings done!\"\r\n\r\nMalet's telegram, as it stands in the Blue Book (Egypt, No. 11, 1882),\r\nsays even less than this. It runs thus: \"The Khedive sent for M.\r\nSinkiewicz and me this morning and informed us that it had come to his\r\nknowledge that the military intended this afternoon to depose him and\r\nproclaim Halim Pasha as Khedive of Egypt.... The Khedive said he hardly\r\nbelieved the truth of this information.\" Yet on such a slender rumour\r\nGladstone, who had declared to me that he never spoke lightly in\r\nParliament and had bidden me wait for his spoken word in the House of\r\nCommons as a message of goodwill to the Egyptians, fires off, to give\r\npoint to his speech, this quite untrue announcement, his first definite\r\nutterance since I had seen him on Egypt. It is a curious comment on the\r\nways of Ministers and the processes of the Gladstonian mind. The\r\nimmediate effect on me of the Prime Minister's speech was a complete and\r\nlasting disillusion. Never after this did I place the smallest trust in\r\nhim, or find reason, even when he came forward as champion of\r\nself-government in Ireland and when I gave him my freest support, to\r\nlook upon him as other than the mere Parliamentarian he in truth was. I\r\ndo not say that on that wonderful 22nd of March he was not for the\r\nmoment in earnest when he spoke to me so humanly, but it was clear that\r\nhis sympathies with the cause of right, however unfeigned, were not the\r\nlaw of his public action, which was dictated, like that of all the rest\r\nof them, by motives of expediency. The discovery destroyed for me an\r\nillusion about him which I have never regained.\r\n\r\n\"_June 2._--Lord De la Warr, Gregory, Brand, and Button met at my house,\r\nand all but Brand seemed highly pleased at the situation. Harry still\r\ncalls me a traitor, and declares that Arabi has made a gigantic fortune,\r\nand that he must and will be suppressed out of Egypt. Button then drew\r\nup with Sabunji a code of signals for him to telegraph us news; and I\r\ngave him £100 for his expenses, for which he will have to account. The\r\ntelegrams are to be sent to me and I am to communicate them to Button\r\nfor the 'Times.' I have given Sabunji my instructions, of which the two\r\nmost important are that Arabi is to make peace with Tewfik and on no\r\npretence to go to Constantinople. Now we have packed him off, anxious\r\nonly lest he should be stopped at Alexandria. Button tells me that if I\r\nhad persisted in going, orders would have been given to Sir Beauchamp\r\nSeymour to prevent my landing.... My mind is at rest.\"\r\n\r\nIf I had heard Gladstone's speech before agreeing with Hamilton to\r\nrenounce my journey to Egypt I probably should have persisted in my\r\nintention, but, as things turned out, I doubt if it would have resulted\r\nin any good. Even if I had not been prevented from landing I could\r\nhardly have used more influence personally with Arabi and the other\r\nleaders than I succeeded in exercising through Sabunji. Sabunji was an\r\nadmirable agent in a mission of this kind, and it is impossible I could\r\nhave been better served. His position as ex-editor of the \"Nahleh,\" a\r\npaper which, whether subsidized or not by Ismaïl, had always advocated\r\nthe most enlightened views of humanitarian progress and Mohammedan\r\nreform, gave him a position with the Azhar reformers of considerable\r\ninfluence, and he was, besides, heart and soul with them in the National\r\nmovement. As my representative he was everywhere received by the\r\nNationalists with open arms, and they gave him their completest\r\nconfidence. Nor was he unworthy of their trust or mine. The letters I\r\nsent him for them he communicated faithfully, and he faithfully reported\r\nto me all that they told him. These letters remain a valuable testimony,\r\nthe only one probably extant, of the inner ideas of the time, and a\r\n_précis_ of them will be found at the end of this volume. Sabunji landed\r\nat Alexandria on the 7th of June and remained till the day before the\r\nbombardment.[15]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[14] This French spelling of Arabi's name used by the P. M. G. was due\r\noriginally, I believe, to Colvin's French colleague, de Blignières, and\r\nwas adopted by him and by Baron Mallortie who, with Colvin, was Morley's\r\nprincipal correspondent that year at Cairo.\r\n\r\n[15] Sabunji remained in my employment till the end of 1883. Then he\r\nleft me and visited India, where he had relations, and after many\r\nvicissitudes of fortune drifted to that common haven of Oriental\r\nrevolutionists, Yildiz Kiosk, where he obtained the confidential post\r\nwith Sultan Abdul Hamid of translator for the Sultan's private eye of\r\nthe European Press, a post which I believe he still holds, 1907.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nDERVISH'S MISSION\r\n\r\n\r\nI have now come to a point in the history of this wonderful intrigue\r\nwhere, if I had not semi-official published matter in large measure to\r\nsupport me, I should find it hopeless to convince historians that I was\r\nnot romancing. It seems so wholly incredible that a Liberal English\r\nGovernment, owning that great and good man Mr. Gladstone as its head,\r\nshould, for any reason in the world financial, political, or of private\r\nnecessity, have embarked on a plan so cynically immoral as that which I\r\nhave now to relate. John Morley in his published life of Gladstone slurs\r\nover the whole of his astonishing Egyptian adventure that year in a\r\nsingle short chapter of fifteen pages, out of the fifteen hundred pages\r\nof which his panegyric consists, and with reason from his point of view,\r\nfor he could have hardly told it in any terms of excuse. It is necessary\r\nall the same that historians less bound to secrecy should have the\r\ndetails plainly put before them, for no history of the British\r\nOccupation will ever be worth the paper it is written on that does not\r\nrecord them.\r\n\r\nBy the 1st of June it was generally acknowledged that the policy of\r\nintimidation by mere threat, even though backed by the presence of the\r\nfleets, had ignominiously failed. Mahmud Sami's Ministry indeed had\r\nresigned, but the initial success had been immediately followed only by\r\na more complete discomfiture. The Ultimatum had expressly demanded that\r\nArabi should leave Egypt, and not only had Arabi not obeyed, but the\r\nKhedive had been obliged by the popular voice to reinstate him as\r\nMinister of War, with even larger responsibilities than before, and in\r\neven more conspicuous honour. Our Foreign Office, therefore, found\r\nitself in the position of having either to eat its empty words in a very\r\npublic manner, or to make them good against one who was now very\r\ngenerally recognized in Europe as a National hero. Its colleague in the\r\nmatter, France, had long shown a desire to be out of the sordid\r\nadventure, and Mr. Gladstone's Government was left practically to act\r\nalone, if it insisted on going on, according to its own methods. The\r\nmethod resolved on was certainly one of the most extraordinary ever used\r\nby a civilized government in modern times, and the very last which could\r\nhave been expected of one owning Mr. Gladstone as its chief. It was to\r\nbeg assistance from the Sultan and persuade him to intervene to \"get rid\r\nof Arabi,\" not by a mere exercise of his sovereign command nor yet by\r\nopenly bringing in against him those Ottoman _gens d'armes_ which had\r\nbeen talked of, but by one of those old-fashioned Turkish acts of\r\ntreachery which were traditional with the Porte in its dealings with its\r\nChristian and other subjects in too successful rebellion against it.\r\n\r\nA first hint of some such possible plan may be found in the \"Pall Mall\r\nGazette,\" in one of its little inspired articles, as far back as the\r\n15th May, in which John Morley, explaining with satisfaction the\r\nGovernment policy of \"bottle holding\" the Khedive, adds that \"Ourabi may\r\nbefore long be quietly got rid of.\" The full plan is of course not\r\ndivulged in the Blue Books, but it is naïvely disclosed a little later\r\nin the \"Pall Mall,\" where, without the slightest apparent sense of its\r\nimpropriety, the dots are put plainly on the i's. The idea as I learned\r\nit at the time was that the Sultan should send a military Commissioner\r\nto Egypt, a soldier of the old energetic unscrupulous type, who, by the\r\nmere terror of his presence, should frighten the Egyptians out of their\r\nattitude of resistance to England, and that as to Arabi, if he could not\r\nbe lured on ship-board and sent to Constantinople, the Commissioner\r\nshould invite him to a friendly conference, and there shoot him, if\r\nnecessary, with his own hand. The suggestion was so like the advice\r\nColvin had given to the Khedive, and had boasted that he gave, nine\r\nmonths before, that there is nothing improbable in its having been\r\nagain entertained. A Commissioner was consequently asked for at\r\nConstantinople, and one Dervish Pasha was chosen, a man of character and\r\nantecedents exactly corresponding to those required for such a job, and\r\ndespatched to Cairo.\r\n\r\nThe excellent Morley, in an enthusiastic paragraph describing the\r\narrival of this new Ottoman _deus ex machina_, grows almost lyrical in\r\nhis praise.\r\n\r\n\"The Egyptian crisis,\" he says, \"has reached its culminating point, and\r\nat last it seems that there is a man at Cairo capable of controlling\r\nevents. There is something very impressive in the calm immovable dignity\r\nof Dervish Pasha, who is emphatically the man of the situation. After\r\nall the shiftings and twistings of diplomatists and the pitiful\r\nexhibition of weakness on the part of the leading actors in this\r\nEgyptian drama, it is an immense relief to find one 'still strong man'\r\nwho, by the mere force of his personal presence, can make every one bow\r\nto his will. Nothing can be more striking than his assertion of\r\nauthority, and nothing more skilful than his casual reference to the\r\nmassacre of the Mamelukes. Dervish is a man of iron, and Arabi may well\r\nquail before his eye. One saucy word, and his head would roll upon the\r\ncarpet. Dervish is quite capable of 'manipulating' Arabi, not in the\r\nWestern but in the Eastern sense of that word. In this strong resolute\r\nOttoman it seems probable that the revolution in Egypt has found its\r\nmaster.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again, 15th June: \"The past career of Dervish Pasha is filled with\r\nincidents which sustain the impression of vigour he has laid down at\r\nCairo. He is at once the most vigorous and unscrupulous of all the\r\nGenerals of the Ottoman army. Although he is now seventy years old, his\r\nage has not weakened his energy or impaired his faculties. His will is\r\nstill as iron as it was of old, and he is quite as capable of ordering a\r\nmassacre of the Mamelukes as was Mehemet Ali himself.... His early\r\nmilitary experience was acquired fighting the Montenegrins, who always\r\nregarded him as the most dangerous Commander whom they had had to meet.\r\nIn one of the last acute fits of hostility (about 1856) between the\r\nPorte and Montenegro, Dervish penetrated to Grakovo, the northernmost\r\ncanton of the Vladikate, as it then was; and the Voivode of the\r\ndistrict, cut off from retreat to the South, took refuge in a cave, the\r\nhabitual hiding-place of the people against sudden raids, it being so\r\nsituated that the usual expedient of attack, smoking out by fires\r\nkindled at the mouth, was inapplicable. The attempts of the Turks to\r\nforce a passage were easily repulsed, and Dervish entered into\r\nnegotiations, the result of which was a surrender on condition of the\r\nlives, liberty and property of the besieged being respected. The\r\nTurkish engagements were kept by the extermination of the entire family\r\nof the Voivode. The prisoners were marched off to Trebinji and thrown\r\ninto the dungeon of the fortress, tied back to back, one of each couplet\r\nbeing killed and the survivor not released for a moment from the burden\r\nof his dead comrade.... Dervish's _modus operandi_ during the late\r\nAlbanian campaign is not generally understood. He went into Albania to\r\nenforce the conscription in which he utterly failed, though he had very\r\nslight military opposition, most of the battles he reported being purely\r\nmythical. But he was very successful in another plan of operation, which\r\nconsisted in quartering himself on the Estates of the principal Beys,\r\nand extorting from them the last pound which could be squeezed out,\r\nwhen he moved on to the next one. He sent quantities of coin to\r\nConstantinople, but no recruits. If any prediction of the latest result\r\nof Dervish's mission may be based upon the history of those in which he\r\nwas formerly engaged, we should say he would succeed with Arabi as he\r\nsucceeded with the Lazis and Albanians.... Egyptians are less warlike\r\nthan Albanians and Lazis, but even in Egypt the Gordian knot may have to\r\nbe severed with the sword.\"\r\n\r\nThese are pretty sayings which, if he remembers them, should, I think,\r\nsometimes make John Morley a little ashamed of the part he was persuaded\r\nby his Foreign Office friends to play that summer as apologist of their\r\niniquities. No wonder he has dismissed the whole Egyptian episode from\r\nhis history in a few pages. Pretty doings, too, for Gladstone to explain\r\nto his non-professional or even his professional conscience! The shade\r\nof Disraeli may well have smiled!\r\n\r\nThe Sultan's new mission, nevertheless, was not, as arranged by Abdul\r\nHamid, quite so simple a piece of villainy as our Foreign Office\r\nimagined. The Emir el Mumenin had no real idea of lending himself as the\r\nmere cat's paw of the Western Powers to do their evil work for them. He\r\nwas pleased to intervene, but not blindly, and he was much in the dark\r\nas to the real situation in Egypt, and desired to be prepared for all\r\ncontingencies. Arabi still had friends at Court who represented him as\r\nchampioning the faith at Cairo, and in Tewfik, Abdul Hamid had never had\r\nany kind of confidence. He still desired to replace him with Halim.\r\nFollowing, therefore, the method usual with him of checking one agent\r\nby another agent, he added to his appointment of Dervish as chief\r\ncommissioner a second commissioner more favourable to Arabi, Sheykh\r\nAhmed Assad, the religious Sheykh of one of the confraternities\r\n(_tarikat_) at Medina, whom he had at Constantinople with him, and was\r\nin the habit of employing in his secret dealings with his Arabic\r\nspeaking subjects, consulting him on all matters connected with his\r\nPan-Islamic propaganda. Thus it happened that on its arrival at\r\nAlexandria the Ottoman mission in reality bore a double character, the\r\none of menace in the person of Dervish, the other of conciliation in\r\nthat of Assad. This Sheykh had it for his special present business to\r\ninform the Sultan of the tone of Arab feeling in Egypt, and especially\r\nof the Ulema of the Azhar, and he was provided with a private cipher,\r\nunknown to Dervish, with which to correspond with his imperial master.\r\nArabi and his intimates gained knowledge of this and were consequently\r\nprepared beforehand to receive the mission as one not wholly\r\nunfavourable to them, and the spectacle was witnessed of both parties in\r\nthe state showing pleasure at its arrival--the Turks and Circassians at\r\nthe appearance of Dervish, and the Egyptians at that of the Medina\r\nSheykh.\r\n\r\nBoth the Khedive as head of the State, and Arabi as head of the\r\nGovernment, sent their delegates to Alexandria to receive the mission,\r\nZulfikar Pasha on the part of the Khedive, Yakub Pasha Sami, the\r\nUnder-Secretary for War, on that of the Minister, and both were well\r\nreceived. Arabi, too, had commissioned Nadim the Orator to go down some\r\ndays before to prepare public opinion to give the envoys a flattering\r\nreception, and at the same time to protest aloud against the Ultimatum\r\ndelivered by Malet and his French colleague. Consequently, when the\r\nprocession was formed to drive through the streets to the railway\r\nstation, the two envoys in their respective carriages, having with them\r\neach a delegate, there was general acclamation on the part of the crowd.\r\n\"_Allah yensor el Sultan_,\" was shouted, \"God give victory to the\r\nSultan\"; and at the same time \"_El leyha, marfudha, marfudha_,\" \"The\r\nUltimatum, reject it, reject it!\" \"Send away the fleet!\" These cries had\r\ntheir effect at once upon the Chief Commissioner, and made Dervish\r\ncautious. Both at Alexandria and at Cairo deputations waited on him at\r\nhis levees from the Notables, merchants, and officials. To all alike\r\nDervish gave a general answer. The Sultan will do justice. He, Dervish,\r\nwas come to restore order and the Sultan's authority. Only to the Turks\r\nhe announced Arabi's speedy departure for Constantinople, to the\r\nEgyptians the as speedy departure of the fleets. Sheykh Assad meanwhile\r\nin private reassured Arabi, declaring to him that the Sultan meant him\r\nno evil.\r\n\r\nAs to the fire-eating attitude attributed by our Foreign Office to\r\nDervish, and alluded to by Morley with so much praise in the passage\r\nalready quoted, it was not in reality of a very determined kind. Dervish\r\nwas old and was far more intent on filling his pockets than on engaging\r\nin a personal struggle with the fellah champion. Tewfik had managed to\r\nget together £50,000 for Dervish as a _backshish_, and that with £25,000\r\nmore in jewels secured him to the Khedive's side, but he made no serious\r\nattempt at any _coup de main_ against Arabi. A single unsuccessful\r\nattempt at brow-beating the Nationalists showed him that the task would\r\nbe a dangerous one. On the Friday after his arrival at Cairo he made a\r\nround of the mosques and expressed his annoyance at the boldness of\r\ncertain of the Ulema, who, on his leaving the Azhar, presented him with\r\na petition, and still more clearly in the afternoon when the main body\r\nof the religious Sheykhs called and stated their views to him with a\r\nfreedom he was unaccustomed to. All these, with the exception of the\r\nex-Sheykh el Islam, el Abbasi, of the Sheykhs Bahrawi and Abyari and the\r\nSheykh el Saadat, who had espoused the Khedive's cause, declared\r\nthemselves strongly in favour of Arabi and urged him to reject the\r\nUltimatum, and especially that part of it which demanded Arabi's exile.\r\nDervish upon this told them to hold their tongues, saying that he had\r\ncome to give orders, not to listen to advice, and dismissed them, at the\r\nsame time decorating with the \"Osmanieh\" the Sheykh el Islam and the\r\nother dissentients.\r\n\r\nPopular feeling, however, immediately manifested itself in a way he\r\ncould not mistake. The Sheykhs returned from their audience in great\r\nanger, and informed every one of the turn things were taking, and the\r\nvery same evening messengers were despatched by the Nationalist leaders\r\nby the evening trains to the provinces to organize remonstrance. Private\r\nmeetings of a strong character were held during the night at Cairo,\r\ndenouncing the Commissioner, and the next morning, Saturday, a monster\r\nmeeting of the students was held in the Azhar mosque to protest against\r\nthe insult offered the Sheykhs. There Nadim was invited to address the\r\nmeeting from the pulpit, and he did so with the eloquence habitual to\r\nhim and with its usual effect. The report of this shook Dervish's\r\nself-confidence, and within a few hours of its reaching him he sent for\r\nArabi, whom he had hitherto refused to see, and Mahmud Sami, and\r\naddressed them both through an interpreter in terms of conciliation,\r\nSheykh Assad being with him and supporting him in Arabic. At this\r\nmeeting, though no coffee or cigarettes were offered (an omission\r\nremarked by them) Dervish adopted towards them a tone of friendliness.\r\nHe made the Nationalist Chiefs sit beside him and expounded the\r\nsituation with apparent frankness. \"We are all here,\" he said, \"as\r\nbrothers, sons of the Sultan. And I with my white beard can be as a\r\nfather to you. We have the same object in view, to oppose the Ghiaour,\r\nand to obtain the departure of the fleet, which is a disgrace to the\r\nSultan and a menace to Egypt. We are all bound to act together to this\r\nend, and show our zeal for our master. This can best be done,\"\r\naddressing Arabi, \"by your resigning your military power into my\r\nhands--at least in appearance--and by your going to Constantinople to\r\nplease the Sultan.\" To this Arabi replied that he was ready to resign\r\nhis command. But that, as the situation was very strained, and as he had\r\nassumed the great responsibility of keeping order he would not consent\r\nto any half measure; if he resigned, he would resign in fact as well as\r\nname, but he would do neither without a written discharge in full.\r\nMoreover, he would not be held responsible for things laid already to\r\nhis charge of which he was innocent. He had been falsely accused of\r\ntyrannical acts, of malversation and other matters, and he would not\r\nleave office without a full discharge in writing from all complaints.\r\nAlso he would defer his voyage to Constantinople till a time when things\r\nshould be more settled, and then go as a private Moslem to pay his\r\nrespects to the Caliph. Dervish was not prepared for this answer and he\r\ndid not like it. His countenance changed. But he said, \"Let us consider\r\nthe matter as settled.\" Then, alluding to the excitement there was at\r\nAlexandria, he added, \"You will telegraph at once to Omar Pasha Lutfi\r\n[the Governor of Alexandria] and the commander of the garrison at\r\nAlexandria to say you have resigned your charge on me, and that you are\r\nacting as my agent, and on Monday there will be a meeting of the Consuls\r\nand the Khedive, and we will give you your discharge.\" Arabi, however,\r\nrefused to do this, declaring that until he had received his written\r\ndischarge he should retain his post and his responsibility. And so,\r\nwithout a definite understanding having been come to between them, he\r\nand Mahmud Sami withdrew.\r\n\r\nSuch is the account, I believe a true one, told by Ninet and confirmed\r\nby others who should know of this important interview. It took place\r\nabout noon on Saturday, the 10th of June, and is of importance in many\r\nways and especially for its bearing on what followed the next day, as is\r\nnotorious, a riot, originating in a quarrel between an Egyptian donkey\r\nboy and a Maltese, broke out there about one o'clock in the forenoon and\r\ncontinued till five, with the result that over two hundred persons lost\r\ntheir lives, including a petty officer of H. M. S. \"Superb,\" and some\r\ntwo hundred more Europeans. Also Cookson, the English Consul, was\r\nseriously hurt, and the Italian and Greek Consuls received minor\r\ninjuries, the disturbance being only quelled by the arrival of the\r\nregular troops. It was the first act of popular violence which, during\r\nthe whole history of the year's revolution in Egypt, had been committed,\r\nand the news of it, spread throughout Europe by telegraph, produced,\r\nespecially in England, a great sensation.\r\n\r\nAs the responsibility for this affair, so unfortunate for the National\r\ncause in Egypt, was afterwards laid upon the person it had most injured,\r\nArabi, and as the incident was made use of by our Foreign Office and\r\nAdmiralty, with other excuses not less unjust, to bring about the\r\nbombardment of Alexandria and the war that followed, the plea being that\r\nEgypt was in a \"proved state of anarchy,\" it will be well here, before\r\nwe go any further, to place upon the right shoulders what criminality\r\nthere was in the whole incident. When I heard of it in London my first\r\ninstinct was that, if not the accident the papers said it was, it was\r\npart of the plot I knew to have been designed through Dervish Pasha at\r\nthe Foreign Office to entrap and betray Arabi, but it was not till after\r\nthe war that I came into possession of the full particulars concerning\r\nit, or had it in my power to refute the false accusations made a little\r\nlater against the Nationalists of having themselves devised and brought\r\nit about. The very contrary to this was then shown to be truth. As we\r\nnow all know, who are in the secrets of that time, the riot, though\r\nperhaps accidental in its immediate origin, had for some weeks\r\npreviously been in the designs of the Court party as a means at the\r\nproper moment to discredit Arabi as one capable of preserving order in\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nThe position of things at Alexandria was this: Alexandria, more than any\r\nother town in Egypt, was in large part a European city, inhabited,\r\nbesides the Moslem population, by Greek, Italian and Maltese colonists,\r\nall engaged in trade and many of them money-lenders. At no time had\r\nthere been much love between the two classes and the arrival of the\r\nfleets, avowedly with the intention of protecting European interests,\r\ngreatly increased the ill-feeling. It needed much loyalty, firmness, and\r\ntact on the part of the Governor of the town to preserve order, and\r\ngreat discretion on the part of the fleet. Unfortunately the Governor,\r\nOmar Pasha Lutfi, was a man entirely opposed to the Nationalist\r\nMinistry. He was a Circassian, a member of the Court party, and a\r\npartisan of the ex-Khedive Ismaïl's, and at the time of the Circassian\r\nplot had done service to Tewfik by entering into communication with the\r\nWestern Bedouins to gain them to the Khedive's side. He had, therefore,\r\nrather encouraged than repressed the element of disorder in the\r\nMohammedan population. The Greeks, on the other hand, had proceeded to\r\narm themselves, with the assistance of the head of their community,\r\nAmbroise Sinadino, a rich banker, who was also agent of the Rothschilds\r\nin Egypt; and the Maltese, a numerous community, did likewise through\r\nthe connivance of Cookson, the English Consul. Things, therefore, were\r\nall it may be said, prepared for a riot as early as the last week of\r\nMay, in expectation of that \"civil war\" which, it will be remembered,\r\nthe \"Pall Mall Gazette\" foresaw as an approved alternative, should the\r\nNationalist Ministry refuse to resign and Arabi to accept suppression.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that disturbance, as a proof of anarchy, was a thing\r\nlooked forward to by our diplomacy at Cairo as probable, and even not\r\nundesirable in the interests of their \"bottle-holding\" policy. That Omar\r\nLutfi had a personal interest in the suppression of Arabi is also\r\neasily proved. In the telegrams of the day, when the Ultimatum was about\r\nto be launched, a list is given of the purely Circassian and Khedivial\r\nMinistry which it was intended should succeed that of Mahmud Sami, and\r\nOmar Lutfi is named in it as the probable successor of Arabi at the War\r\nOffice. Nor was this announcement unfounded, for a few days later we\r\nknow that Omar Lutfi was, in fact, sent for by the Khedive to the\r\nIsmaïlia Palace and offered the post.[16] The Ultimatum was delivered on\r\nthe 1st of June, and the Ministers resigned on the 2nd, having waited a\r\nday because the Khedive had told them he would first telegraph for\r\nadvice to Constantinople, though on the following morning, when they\r\nagain came to him, he informed them that his mind was made up to accept\r\nthe Ultimatum notwithstanding that he had received no answer. When,\r\ntherefore, on the 3rd the Khedive had been obliged, through the popular\r\ndemonstration in Arabi's favour, backed by the German and Austrian\r\nConsuls, who saw in Arabi the man best capable in Egypt of maintaining\r\norder, to rename Arabi Minister of War, the disappointment to Omar Lutfi\r\nis easily understood, and the temptation he was under of creating\r\npractical proof that the German Consuls were wrong. We have, besides\r\nthis, evidence that on the 5th of June the Khedive, who, no less than\r\nOmar Lutfi, had received a great rebuff, sent him a telegram in the\r\nfollowing words: \"Arabi has guaranteed public order, and published it in\r\nthe newspapers, and has made himself responsible to the Consuls; and if\r\nhe succeeds in his guarantee the Powers will trust him, and our\r\nconsideration will be lost. Also the fleets of the Powers are in\r\nAlexandrian waters, and men's minds are excited, and quarrels are not\r\nfar off between Europeans and others. Now, therefore, choose for\r\nyourself whether you will serve Arabi in his guarantee or whether you\r\nwill serve us.\" On this hint Omar Lutfi immediately took his\r\nmeasures. As civil governor he was in command of the Mustafezzin, the\r\nsemi-military police of Alexandria, and through them directed that\r\nquarterstaves, (_nabuts_) should be collected at the police stations to\r\nbe served out at the proper moment, and other preparations made for an\r\nintended disturbance. Ample proof may be found in the evidence printed\r\nin the Blue Books of the complicity of the police in the affair, though\r\na confusion is constantly made by those who give the evidence between\r\nthese and the regular soldiers by speaking of the police, as is often\r\nloosely done in Egypt, as _soldiers_. The regulars were not under the\r\ncivil, but the military governors, and took no part in the affair until\r\ncalled in at a late hour by Omar Lutfi when he found the riot had\r\nassumed proportions he could not otherwise control. It is to be noted\r\nthat the chief of the Mustafezzin, Seyd Kandil, a timid adherent of\r\nArabi's, refused to take part in the day's proceedings, excusing himself\r\nto Omar Lutfi on the ground of illness.\r\n\r\nThe disturbance was therefore prepared already for execution when\r\nDervish and his fellow Commissioner landed on the 8th at Alexandria. It\r\nwas probably intended to synchronize with the plot of Arabi's arrest,\r\nand to prove to the Sultan's Commissioner, more than to any one else,\r\nthat Arabi had not the power to keep order in the country that he\r\nclaimed. I am not, however, at all convinced that Dervish was in\r\nignorance of what was intended, and I think there is a very great\r\nprobability that he had learned it before his interview with Arabi, and\r\nthat if he had succeeded in getting Arabi to resign his responsibility\r\nthe riot would have been countermanded. As it is, there is some evidence\r\nthat the outbreak took place earlier than was intended. It is almost\r\ncertain that the immediate occasion of it, the quarrel between the\r\ndonkey boy and the Maltese, was accidental, but probably the police had\r\nreceived no counter-orders, and so the thing was allowed to go on\r\naccording to the program. What is certain is that the Khedive and Omar\r\nLutfi, the one at Cairo, the other at Alexandria, monopolized\r\ntelegraphic communication between the two cities, that Omar Lutfi put\r\noff on one and another pretext, from hour to hour, calling in the\r\nmilitary, who could not act without his orders as civil governor in a\r\ncase of riot, and that the occurrence was regarded at the Palace as a\r\nsubject of rejoicing and by Arabi and the Nationalists as one to be\r\nregretted and minimized. Also, and this is a very important matter, the\r\ncommittee named to inquire into the causes of the affair by the Khedive\r\nwas composed almost entirely of his own partisans, while he secured its\r\nbeing of no effective value as throwing light on the true authors, by\r\nappointing Omar Lutfi himself to be its president. The connection of\r\nOmar Lutfi and the Khedive, moreover, is demonstrated in the fact that,\r\nwhile given leave of absence when suspicion was too strong against him\r\namong the Consuls, he nevertheless reappeared after the bombardment and,\r\njoining the Khedive, obtained the post he coveted of Minister of War, a\r\npost which he held until May, 1883, when Lord Randolph Churchill having\r\nbrought the case against him and the Khedive forward in Parliament, he\r\nat the end of the year retired into private life. Fuller proof of their\r\ncomplicity will be found in the Appendix.\r\n\r\nOne point only in this sinister affair is still a matter for me of much\r\nperplexity, and that is to determine the exact amount of responsibility\r\nassignable in it to our agent at Cairo and Alexandria. There are\r\npassages in Malet's despatches which seem to show that he was looking\r\nforward, about the time when the disturbance was first contemplated, to\r\nsome violent solution of his diplomatic difficulties, and there is no\r\ndoubt that it had been for some time past part of his argument against\r\nthe Nationalist Government that it was producing anarchy. Also it is\r\ncertain that Cookson had connived at the arming of the Maltese British\r\nsubjects at Alexandria. Still, from that to complicity in a design to\r\ncreate a special riot there is a wide difference, and everything that I\r\nknow of Malet's character and subsequent conduct in regard to the riot\r\nconvinces me that he did not know this one at Alexandria was intended.\r\nMalet honestly believed in Tewfik as a trustworthy and amiable prince,\r\nand accepted whatever tales he told, and his undeception about him after\r\nthe war I know to have been painfully complete. With regard to Colvin\r\nmuch the same may be said. He was probably as ignorant of the exact plan\r\nas he had been of the Khedive's true action the year before at Abdin,\r\nthough it is difficult to understand that either he or Malet should not\r\nhave soon afterwards guessed the truth. They had both allied themselves\r\nto the party of disorder, and when disorder came they accepted the\r\nKhedive's story without any close inquiry because it suited them to\r\naccept it, and they made use of it as an argument for what they wanted,\r\nthe ruin of Nationalist Egypt and armed intervention. That is all the\r\nconnection with the crime I personally lay at their doors.\r\n\r\nWhat followed may be briefly sketched here before I return to my\r\njournal. The immediate effect of the riot was not exactly that which the\r\nKhedive and his friends intended. It had been allowed to go much farther\r\nthan was in their plan, so much farther that the regular army had been\r\nobliged to be called in, and instead of discrediting Arabi it so\r\nseriously frightened the Levantine population of Alexandria, who were a\r\nchicken-hearted community, that they began to look to him as their only\r\nprotector. Even the Foreign Consuls, all but the English, came round to\r\nthis view of the case, and the perfect order which the army from this\r\ntime on succeeded in maintaining, both there and at Cairo, largely\r\nincreased his prestige. I believe that then, late though it was in the\r\nday, Arabi, if he had been really a strong ruler, which unfortunately he\r\nwas not, and if he had been a better judge of men and judge of\r\nopportunity--in a word, if he had been a man of action and not what he\r\nwas, a dreamer, he might have won the diplomatic game against his\r\nunscrupulous opponents. For this, however, it was necessary that he\r\nshould denounce and punish the true authors of the riot; and that he\r\nshould have proved with a strong arm that in Egypt he was really master,\r\nand that any one who dared disturb the peace should feel the weight of\r\nit. Then he would have appealed to Europe and to the Sultan in the words\r\nof a strong man and they would not have been disregarded; nor would our\r\nGovernment in England, who, after all, were no paladins, have stood out\r\nagainst the rest. Unfortunately for liberty Arabi was no such strong\r\nman, only, as I have said, a humanitarian dreamer, and with little more\r\nthan a certain basis of obstinacy for the achievement of his ideals. He\r\nwas absolutely ignorant of Europe, or of the common arts and crafts of\r\nits diplomacy. Thus he missed the opportune moment, and presently the\r\nEuropeans, frightened by Malet and Colvin, who were playing a double\r\ngame with him, getting him to preserve order while they were preparing\r\nthe bombardment, lost confidence in him and his chance was over. From\r\nthat moment there was no longer any hope of a peaceful solution. A wolf\r\nand a lamb quarrel was picked with him by Sir Beauchamp Seymour, who had\r\nsworn to be revenged on the Alexandrians for the death of his\r\nbody-servant, a man of the name of Strackett, who had been killed in the\r\nriot; and the bombardment followed. A greater man than Arabi might, I\r\nsay, have possibly pulled it through. But Arabi was only a kind of\r\nsuperior fellah, inspired with a few fine ideas, and he failed. He does\r\nnot however, for that deserve the blame he has received at the hands of\r\nhis countrymen. Not one of them even attempted to do better.[17]\r\n\r\nNow to return to London and my journal:\r\n\r\n\"_June 3._--To Lady Granville's party at the Foreign Office. All the\r\npolitical people there. Everybody connected with the Foreign Office\r\nostentatiously cordial. Talked about the situation to Wolseley,\r\nRawlinson, the American Minister (Lowell) and others. Also had a long\r\ntalk with Sir Alexander and Lady Malet, who were very kind in spite of\r\nmy political quarrel with their son. People seem relieved at the crisis\r\nin Egypt being postponed. But Wolseley tells me the Sultan has refused\r\nthe Conference. The Khedive's cousin, the fat Osman Pasha, was there,\r\nand the Princes of Wales and Edinburgh and Prince Leopold and the Duke\r\nof Cambridge and other bigwigs. I was surprised to find Henry Stanley,\r\ntoo, quite cordial. He said he had a great admiration for Arabi as\r\nchampion of the Faith, and that they would promote him, and both he and\r\nTewfik remain at Cairo. So, as he represents Constantinople views, I\r\nconclude there is no danger from that quarter. The game seems won now,\r\nbarring new accidents.\"\r\n\r\nThis last reference, which is to Lord Stanley of Alderley, is of\r\nimportance. He was a very old and close friend of mine, but we had\r\nhitherto differed about Egypt, and on this ground. He had been many\r\nyears before, in the time of Lord Stratford de Redcliffe, Attaché to our\r\nEmbassy at Constantinople, and had imbibed there the extreme\r\nphilo-Turkish views then in fashion with Englishmen. In 1860, while\r\ntravelling in the East Indies, he had become a Mohammedan, and I had\r\nfirst made his acquaintance in a rather singular way. I was on my way in\r\nthe autumn of that year from Athens and Constantinople to England, and\r\nwas travelling up the Danube when there came on board our steamer at one\r\nof the Roumanian ports the family of an ex-hospodar, and with them an\r\nEnglishman of no very distinguished appearance, and of rather plain,\r\nbrusque manners, whom I took to be their tutor or secretary. As our\r\njourney lasted several days, I made friends with my fellow traveller,\r\nand found him interesting from his great knowledge of the East, but he\r\ndid not tell me his name. On our arrival, however, at Vienna, he\r\nproposed to go with me to the Embassy, and I then discovered who he was,\r\nand we travelled on together to Munich, where his younger brother,\r\nLyulph Stanley, a Balliol undergraduate, was learning German, and in\r\nthis way I became acquainted little by little with all his family. I\r\ncame to know him very well, and I take this opportunity of saying that,\r\nthough he was undoubtedly eccentric in his ideas, he remained through\r\nlife one of the sincerest and least selfish men I have known. As a\r\nMoslem he was entirely in earnest, and in many ways he sympathized with\r\nmy views, but he would not hear of my preference of the Arabs to the\r\nTurks, whom he considered the natural leaders of Islam. In London he was\r\nalways in close relations with the Ottoman Embassy, and his view of the\r\nposition as between the Sultan and Arabi--the Dervish mission was\r\nalready in the air--has on this account considerable historical value.\r\n\r\n\"_June 4._--Sunday at Crabbet. The first day for weeks I have not\r\nthought about Egypt. I consider the whole matter settled now, and have\r\nplayed tennis all the afternoon with a light heart. The Wentworths,\r\nNoels, Frank Lascelles, Henry Cowper, Molony, and others came down from\r\nLondon. Lovely weather.\r\n\r\n\"_June 5._--To London again.... Lady Gregory tells me they are\r\ndispleased now with Colvin--consider him not suited to his place in\r\nEgypt--this from Lord Northbrook. Lord Granville has sent to consult him\r\n(Sir William Gregory).\" Lady Gregory, be it noted, had remained more\r\nstaunch than had her husband to the National cause; and later they both\r\nrendered once more important services to Arabi, especially at the time\r\nof his trial. The London newspapers at this time were beginning to take\r\na more intelligent interest in Egyptian affairs, most of them having\r\nsent special correspondents to Cairo or Alexandria, among them the\r\n\"Daily Telegraph,\" whose correspondent became a strong Arabist.\r\n\r\n\"_June 6._--The 'Daily News' is already preparing itself for a renewal\r\nof the _status quo ante ultimatum_, and the other papers seem likely to\r\nfollow suit,--all but the 'Times' and 'Pall Mall,\" just the two papers\r\nwhich had the truth preached to them and which rejected it. English\r\nopinion, however, is hardly now a straw in the balance.... I had another\r\nlong talk with Lascelles, and hope that I have more or less converted\r\nhim. In the evening I rode with Bertram Currie, who offers to wager\r\nArabi will have been extinguished in a fortnight.\" (_N. B._--Bertram was\r\nthe elder brother of Philip Currie, a banker, and strong practical\r\nsupporter of Gladstone, with whom he was personally intimate. His\r\nopinion, no doubt, reflects that of Downing Street at the moment.)\r\n\r\n\"_June 7._--Lady Gregory came in and gave me news. She tells me that\r\nLord Granville told her husband that all their hopes now rested on\r\nDervish's mission from Constantinople. 'Dervish,' Lord Granville said,\r\n'is quite unscrupulous, and he will get rid of Arabi one way or other.'\r\nI suppose this means by bribing;[18] indeed, Lord Granville seems to\r\nhave said as much, but it may also mean by 'coffee.' I do not, however,\r\nfear the latter. The Sultan's object will be to get Arabi to\r\nConstantinople, not to kill, but to keep him as a hostage. I am anxious\r\nall the same Sabunji should arrive. I cannot help fancying they may try\r\nand prevent his landing, knowing his connection with me. A note has come\r\nfrom him written in the train, with additions to our code of signals\r\nwhich are rather amusing.... Later saw Gregory, who confirms all his\r\nwife told me of his interview with Granville. He thinks Colvin and Malet\r\nmust be recalled.... Pembroke writes to John Pollen that the Foreign\r\nOffice is unbounded in its anger against me. Never mind.... I met Austin\r\nLee, Dilke's secretary, at the Club, and he asked me the latest news\r\nfrom Egypt. I said, 'I hear you are sending a barrel of salt to put on\r\nArabi's tail.' 'No,' he answered with some readiness, 'the salt is to\r\npickle him.' ... Rode in the evening with Cyril Flower (who had married\r\na Rothschild) advised him to sell his Egyptian Bonds.... Dined with\r\nBertram, whom I found much more humane. He believes in Gladstone, and\r\nthe eventual independence of Ireland. 'Only,' he says, 'Gladstone has\r\nthe misfortune of being a generation before his age. We shall all\r\nbelieve in attending to our own affairs in another twenty years.'\r\n\r\n\"Frederic Harrison has written to protest in the 'Pall Mall' against\r\nintervention in Egypt.\" This was a powerful article headed \"Money, Sir,\r\nMoney,\" which was followed by other letters. I have always regretted\r\nthat I had not earlier become acquainted with the writer, the soundest\r\nand most courageous man on foreign policy then in the Liberal Party, and\r\nby far their most vigorous pamphleteer. Had we met a month or two\r\nbefore, I feel sure that he might have prevented the war, for though not\r\nin Parliament, he wielded great influence. The misfortune of the public\r\nposition that Spring was that there was not a single man of great\r\nintellectual weight in the party, Harrison excepted, free from official\r\nbondage.... \"Party at Lady Salisbury's. Talked with Miltown, who was\r\nrather angry, I thought, at my handiwork in Egypt, and not quite polite\r\nabout my telegrams. Also with old Strathnairn, who would like 'to go out\r\nwith 10,000 men and hang Arabi.' Also with Osman and Kiamil Pashas, the\r\nKhedive's cousins, though not about politics.... The Sultan's Commission\r\nhas arrived in Egypt.\r\n\r\n\"_June 8._--A telegram from Sabunji at Alexandria announcing his\r\narrival. Now I feel relieved from anxiety. He says the Turkish\r\nCommission has gone to Cairo.... Harry Brand refuses to come to my\r\nlawn-tennis party at Crabbet till he sees how things go at Cairo. I fear\r\nhe has much of his money in Egypt and will lose it.\r\n\r\n\"_June 9._--There is another letter from Frederic Harrison in the 'Pall\r\nMall.' Wrote to propose to show him my correspondence with Gladstone.\r\nSaw the Gregorys. The Commission is hailed with a great flourish of\r\ntrumpets at Cairo, but we fancy this is only to herald a compromise.\r\nSabunji telegraphs that Arabi has declared publicly he will resist the\r\nlanding of Turkish troops. He is still at Alexandria, which disquiets\r\nme. He ought to be in Cairo. Dined at Wentworth House to meet Sir Bartle\r\nFrere, a soft-spoken, intelligent man.\r\n\r\n\"_June 10._--Luncheon with Mr. and Mrs. Green, very superior and\r\nsympathetic about Egypt.\" (_N. B._--This was Green the historian. He was\r\nalready in failing health. I have a clear recollection of his emotional\r\nsympathy with me and with the cause I was pleading. His loss to an\r\nhonest understanding of statesmanship was a great one.) \"I am anxious\r\nabout things there for the first time for a fortnight. The evening\r\npapers announced that Dervish has won--bought over--a part of the army\r\nand has proclaimed himself Commander-in-Chief, summoning Arabi to\r\nsubmit. Unless he stands firm now all is lost. After much consideration\r\nI have sent the following telegram to Sabunji: '7 p. m. Arrest\r\nCommission. Fear not but God.' This partly in cipher. My trouble is lest\r\nSabunji should not have gone to Cairo. Or why does he not telegraph? Can\r\nhe have come to grief?... Dinner at Lyulph Stanley's where, besides\r\nothers, we met Bright. I found him most humane about Egypt, and spoke a\r\nfew words with him, I hope, in season. I spoke my mind pretty freely. It\r\nis now a question of boldness on the part of the National Party. I fancy\r\nDervish's orders have been to test this, and, if he finds them\r\ndetermined, to support them. He will crush them, if he can, through the\r\nCircassians. But I trust they may crush him, or at any rate frighten\r\nhim. The Sultan dares not put them down by force.\r\n\r\n\"_June 11_, Sunday.--By early train to Crabbet. I was very nervous\r\nlooking into the papers lest some _coupe de main_ should have been made.\r\nBut the 'Observer' shows that nothing has yet happened. There are the\r\nsame stories of Dervish's swagger to the Ulema and the officers. But\r\nthat is nothing.... At 2 o'clock the Princes Osman and Kiamil and their\r\ncousin ---- and their alem Aarif Bey and an English bear-leader, one\r\nLemprière, came down to see our horses. While we were showing them these\r\na telegram came in cipher from Sabunji as follows: 'Cairo, 12 p. m.,\r\nJune 10. I have just had an interview with Arabi. He is supported by the\r\nParliament, the University, and the Army, all except Sultan Pasha and\r\nthe Sheykh el Islam. The nation is decided to depose the Khedive. The\r\nPorte dislikes the proposals of Europe. Arabi insists there will be no\r\npeace while Malet and Colvin are here. Arabi will resist a Turkish\r\ninvasion. He will not go to Constantinople. Sheykh Aleysh has been made\r\nhead of the Azhar. The Porte has decided to depose the Khedive. Malet\r\nhas urged the proposals of Europe on the Commission. Abdallah Nadim at a\r\npublic meeting of 10,000 spoke against these proposals and against the\r\nKhedive.' If the Khedive's cousins whom we were entertaining could have\r\nread it, it would have spoiled their appetites. We have talked the\r\nmatter over and are going to telegraph them to proclaim a republic in\r\ncase they depose Tewfik. I am relieved of all anxiety now that I know\r\nSabunji is with them.\"\r\n\r\nIn what I here say of Princes Osman and Kiamil I do them less than\r\njustice. They had no love for Tewfik, their father Mustafa having been\r\ndriven out of Egypt and despoiled of much of his possessions by Ismaïl,\r\nand they also had a considerable amount of patriotism. At least they\r\ngave proof of it during the war when they were among Arabi's strongest\r\nadherents. Their sister, Nazli Hanum, did much to help us at the time of\r\nthe trial. Aarif Bey was a young man of great ability, a Kurd by birth\r\nbut with Arab blood, well educated and of high distinction. He\r\nafterwards became Secretary to Mukhtar Pasha at Cairo, and edited a\r\nliterary newspaper, but lost himself in intrigues of all kinds and has\r\ndisappeared. The fourth person on this occasion was a Europeanized Turk\r\nand member of the Sultan's household, but his name in my diary is not\r\nrecorded. We talked Eastern politics, though not Egyptian, freely at\r\ndinner, politics of a Pan-Islamic kind which included the hope that\r\nFrance as well as England would sooner or later be driven out of North\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\nI may here insert a letter I wrote to Sabunji on the 9th, and one I\r\nreceived from him of the same date as his telegram just given.\r\n\r\n     \"10, James Street, _June 9, 1882_.\r\n\r\n     \"Your telegram announcing your landing in Egypt relieved me of much\r\n     anxiety. I hope by this time you are at Cairo and in communication\r\n     with our friends. I think they cannot do better just now than keep\r\n     on the best possible terms with the Commissioners. Only I would\r\n     have them beware of trusting them. I know that great hopes are\r\n     placed by the enemies of Egypt on Dervish as a man quite\r\n     unscrupulous in his mode of dealing with rebels. Every effort will\r\n     be made to get Arabi to go to Constantinople. But this he must not\r\n     do. They will try to bribe him and persuade him that his going will\r\n     be for the good of the country. He must not be deluded. It is\r\n     possible even they may try to arrest or poison him, though I do not\r\n     think that likely. When, however, they see he stands firm and has\r\n     got the country with him, they will not quarrel with him. My strong\r\n     advice to him is that he should make his submission at once to\r\n     Mohammed Tewfik as the Sultan's viceroy, on condition of retaining\r\n     his place as Minister of War. If he does this the English and\r\n     French Governments will have no just cause of quarrel with him; and\r\n     the European Conference, if it assembles, will not sanction their\r\n     further intervention. I am sure that our Government will not insist\r\n     on their Ultimatum as regards Arabi leaving the country. But they\r\n     and the French are bound to support Tewfik as nominal sovereign of\r\n     Egypt. It would be very dangerous at the present moment for Arabi\r\n     to quarrel either with Tewfik or the Sultan. Only let him hold his\r\n     ground as practical ruler of the country.... People are very angry\r\n     here with me, but I do not care, so long as Egypt gets her\r\n     liberty.\"\r\n\r\nI give a letter, somewhat condensed, which was written to me by Sabunji\r\nfrom Cairo on the day of the Alexandrian riot, but before news of it had\r\nreached him.\r\n\r\n     \"Cairo, _June 11, 1882_.\r\n\r\n     \"On my arrival I called on Arabi Pasha, Mahmud Sami and others who\r\n     are of the party. They received me with enthusiasm and inquired\r\n     after you. Mohammed Abdu informed me that he had been told you had\r\n     been advised by some influential people not to come to Cairo. Arabi\r\n     overwhelmed me with joy when he saw me. A week before my arrival he\r\n     addressed a large audience and read them a letter I had written, in\r\n     which I dwelt upon the necessity of perfect union among\r\n     themselves....\r\n\r\n     \"The situation at present stands thus: In my telegram I told you\r\n     how we had talked of all that had happened from the discovery of\r\n     the Circassian plot down to the present date. Now Sheykh Aleysh,\r\n     the great holy man of the Azhar, has issued a _fetwa_ in which he\r\n     states that the present Khedive, having attempted to sell his\r\n     country to the foreigners by following the advice of the European\r\n     Consuls, is no more worthy of ruling over the Moslems of Egypt. He\r\n     must therefore be deposed. All the Sheykhs of the Azhar, who\r\n     consider Sheykh Aleysh as their spiritual head, have accepted the\r\n     _fetwa_.... Sheykh Mohammed Khodeyr of the Azhar went with\r\n     twenty-two Notables to meet Dervish Pasha, and presented him a\r\n     petition signed by 10,000 persons in which they requested him to\r\n     reject the proposals of the Powers and depose the Khedive. There\r\n     are fourteen moudiriehs in Egypt. Only three mudirs are personally\r\n     opposed to Arabi. The Copt and Arab element of the fellahin\r\n     unanimously supports him.... Embabeh (Sheykh el Islam), being\r\n     afraid of both the Khedive and the National Party, keeps aloof, and\r\n     avoids politics under plea of ill-health. Arabi told me 'he will\r\n     never yield either to Europe or Turkey. Let them send European,\r\n     Turkish, or Indian troops, as long as I breathe I will defend my\r\n     country; and when we are all dead they will possess a ruined\r\n     country, and we shall have the glory of having died for our native\r\n     land. Nor is this all. A religious war will succeed the political\r\n     one, and the responsibility of this will fall on those who provoke\r\n     it.' He is determined to resist and will not go to Constantinople;\r\n     Arabi is now supported by the majority of the nation. Nine only of\r\n     the Deputies are against him. Sultan Pasha has deserted him and\r\n     joined the Khedive, being frightened by Malet and the arrival of\r\n     the fleet. He and the Khedive are now looked upon by all the Arab\r\n     element as traitors.... Deputations from all the provinces came to\r\n     Dervish requesting the deposition of the Khedive, a fact which it\r\n     is impossible to explain on the supposition that Arabi compelled\r\n     them.... Ninety thousand persons have signed petitions to Dervish\r\n     to reject the proposals of Europe and keep Arabi in office.\r\n\r\n     \"All the Azhar Sheykhs except Embabeh, el Abbasi, and the Sheykh el\r\n     Saadat are supporting Arabi, also Abd-el-Rahman Bahrawi. Nadim held\r\n     a large meeting of about 10,000 persons in Alexandria, and spoke\r\n     against the proposals of Europe, and proved the unfitness of the\r\n     Khedive to reign. He brought proofs from the Koran, the Hadith,\r\n     and modern history to prove his case and persuade his hearers.\r\n     Arabi also in an animated speech denounced all the misdeeds of the\r\n     reigning dynasty from Mohammed Ali down to Tewfik. I have spoken to\r\n     Abdu, Nadim, and others about soliciting letters and signatures\r\n     from Notables, Ulema, fellahin, merchants, and others, to be sent\r\n     to you to prove the reality of the National movement. They agree to\r\n     get the documents in ten days and I shall send them to you.\r\n\r\n     \"I have found out that we formed an erroneous idea of Mahmud Pasha\r\n     Sami. I have had many conversations with him and have got\r\n     information about him even from his opponents. I find he is one of\r\n     those who first planned the National movement as long ago as in\r\n     Ismaïl's time. He suffered a great deal for his liberalism yet\r\n     stuck to his principles. Several of the leaders of the party,\r\n     Nadim, Abdu, and even Arabi, confess that they owe their power to\r\n     his help and constancy. He was tempted by Ismaïl to give up the\r\n     party, but he refused all money. He spends all his income in doing\r\n     good to the party, and his house is like a caravanserai. His\r\n     private life is that of a philosopher, spending little on himself\r\n     and satisfied with his lot and all that comes. He is not an\r\n     ignorant man. He is well versed in Arabic literature, better than\r\n     Arabi, and if he is hated by the Turks it is a proof of his\r\n     patriotism. He is going to write a letter to Lord Granville to\r\n     prove the existence of a real National Party in Egypt, and to avow\r\n     their friendship to England, which they look upon as the champion\r\n     of liberty, and as a nation which has always taken by the hand\r\n     people who were struggling for their freedom. I suggested that\r\n     similar letters from Arabi and Embabeh to Lord Granville and Mr.\r\n     Gladstone would be of use, and I promised to translate the letters\r\n     and send them to their destination.\r\n\r\n     \"When it was rumoured that the Sultan intended sending Dervish to\r\n     urge Arabi to accept the Powers' Ultimatum, Nadim went to\r\n     Alexandria and held a meeting of about 10,000 persons and spoke for\r\n     two hours against the Note and suggested that every one in the\r\n     Assembly should protest against it. Nadim, the new Oracle of\r\n     Delphi, was cordially obeyed. When the men returned home they\r\n     taught their wives and children to join them in protesting against\r\n     the Note. In fact, when Dervish landed, the children were heard\r\n     shouting in the streets '_el leyha, el leyha_,' 'the note, the\r\n     note,' and from the windows the women called out, '_marfudha,\r\n     marfudha_,' 'reject it, reject it.' Dervish took a lesson from this\r\n     and changed his colours....\r\n\r\n     \"Embabeh, who for a few days showed himself hostile to the National\r\n     Party for having openly sanctioned the deposition of the Khedive,\r\n     yesterday made peace with them. But Sultan Pasha has disappointed\r\n     every one. He has joined the Khedive blindly, frightened by the\r\n     thought of an European intervention, and being assured by Malet\r\n     that Arabi would not be suffered to remain in office. Thus the poor\r\n     old fellow fell into the same snare with Sherif. He is no longer\r\n     popular, and has got nothing for his change of policy.\r\n\r\n     \"Another curious event took place yesterday. When Dervish summoned\r\n     the Ulema to consult about the best measures to be taken for an\r\n     honourable peace, two of the Ulema only took the Khedive's part.\r\n     All the rest pleaded the National cause. Dervish was vexed and\r\n     dissolved the Assembly, decorating the two dissenting Sheykhs,\r\n     Bahrawi and Abyari. When the result was published in the papers it\r\n     created a revolutionary movement in the Azhar. I was present at\r\n     several of the meetings of the Ulema and other persons, and there\r\n     was general indignation. The Koran and the Hadith were freely\r\n     quoted, showing the unfitness of Tewfik to rule over a Mussulman\r\n     community. They were not satisfied, however, with private meetings,\r\n     but in my presence insisted upon holding a public meeting in the\r\n     Azhar to protest against the insult inflicted on them. Accordingly\r\n     the meeting was held in the Azhar Mosque, in the very place where\r\n     the prayers are made; and Nadim was ordered by the Ulema to address\r\n     the Assembly, which exceeded four thousand persons. The effect\r\n     produced by Nadim's oration I have no time to describe. You have\r\n     seen Nadim and know how eagerly people hear him and how excited\r\n     they get by his eloquence.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[16] The \"Pall Mall\" of 28th May, has the following: \"Cairo, 27th May,\r\nOmar Pasha Lutfi, Sherif Pasha, Ragheb Pasha, and Sultan Pasha,\r\nPresident of the Chamber of Notables, assembled at noon to-day at the\r\nIsmaïlia Palace.... The Presidency of the Council will probably be held\r\nby Sherif Pasha or Omar Pasha Lutfi.... Omar Pasha Lutfi will be\r\nMinister of War.\"\r\n\r\n[17] Arabi was probably deterred from taking open action against Omar\r\nLutfi, in part by the strong solidarity there is among Moslems in all\r\nquarrels with non-Moslems, in part by his suspicion of the Khedive's\r\ncomplicity, which at first was a suspicion only. He was extremely loath\r\nto quarrel with Tewfik at that moment, as he had just been reconciled to\r\nhim, and only a few days before had sworn to protect his life as he\r\nwould his own. He preferred therefore, in his language at the time, to\r\nattribute the chief blame to Cookson and Sinadino, who truly on their\r\nside were not without blame. This will be seen in Sabunji's letters and\r\nother documents concerning the riot printed in the Appendix.\r\n\r\n[18] My diary of 1888 records: \"Dec. 22, Cairo. To breakfast with Zebehr\r\nPasha.... He spoke highly of Arabi, and said that he had been present at\r\na conversation, between him and Dervish Pasha, in which Dervish had\r\noffered Arabi E£250 a month if he would go to Constantinople. But Arabi\r\nhad said that, even if he were willing, there were 10,000 men would\r\nstand between him and the sea.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nA LAST APPEAL TO GLADSTONE\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of feeling in the inner circle of the Nationalists at\r\nCairo when the Alexandrian riot occurred. The next day I went up to\r\nLondon in high spirits, carrying with me Sabunji's telegram of the 10th\r\nto show to Hamilton. The news of the riot met me at the station.\r\n\r\n\"_June 12._--... Another scare. Riots at Alexandria, Cookson hurt, an\r\nofficer of the Superb killed, and fifty or sixty Europeans. This has\r\ncaused great excitement. I am not sure whether it will be for Arabi's\r\nadvantage or not. It will show he is master of the situation; unless,\r\nindeed, it be a trap laid for him by Dervish to get him to go to\r\nAlexandria where he might arrest him.... I went to Eddy Hamilton and\r\ntold him I was now in possession of indisputable knowledge that Arabi\r\ncommanded the country, also that Tewfik was in great danger of being\r\ndeposed by the feeling of the country, and that, if they did not want a\r\nviolent solution of the difficulty, they had better come speedily to\r\nterms with him. He promised to repeat all I said to Gladstone. It is\r\nevident to me now that they would catch at any compromise which should\r\nleave Tewfik on the throne.\r\n\r\n\"Went down to the House of Commons. Harry Brand asked his father, the\r\nSpeaker, for a ticket of entrance for the 'rebel Blunt,' and he said,\r\n'he does not deserve one,' but gave it. Dilke answered various questions\r\nabout Egypt, assuming that Dervish and the Khedive were having it all\r\ntheir own way. This has rather frightened me, for there is a report that\r\nArabi has gone down with Dervish to Alexandria (this proved untrue), and\r\nI fear treachery. Sabunji, too, has sent a new telegram as follows: 'I\r\nhave just seen Arabi. Your message delivered. All quiet. Abdallah Nadim\r\naddressed four thousand persons at the Azhar, attacking the Turkish\r\nCommission and the Khedive. The Commission has withdrawn the proposals\r\nof Europe, and I hope for peace. The Circassians are intriguing. The\r\nSheykh el Islam has rejoined, Sultan Pasha has not. The riot is\r\nnothing.' To this we composed an answer coming down in the train, and\r\nsent it from Three Bridges: 'Dervish means mischief, bribery, perhaps\r\nmurder. Call a public meeting under Nadim and Abdu and the Azhar\r\nUniversity, a hundred thousand persons. Let them insist on Dervish's\r\ndeparture. If this is refused let him be arrested by the police and sent\r\naway. Make terms with the Khedive. Be careful the Consuls are not\r\nmolested. Let Nadim be the mover in action. Arabi and the army must\r\nstand aloof.' I am far from easy in my mind.\r\n\r\n\"Had a long conversation before leaving London with Frederic Harrison,\r\nwho has written again on Egypt to the 'Pall Mall.' I have shown him my\r\nletters to Gladstone. He will be of valuable assistance.... Just as we\r\nwere leaving James Street Lady Malet rushed in wildly, demanding of me\r\nthe truth of what I had been doing in Egypt. I told her pretty nearly.\r\nShe said my honour was at stake in clearing myself of the charge of\r\nintriguing against my country. She besought me, too, to calm down things\r\nthere; and I promised to send a message to Arabi not to touch a hair of\r\nher son's head. I shall write by to-morrow's mail, and in the meanwhile\r\nmy telegram will suffice. I do not think he runs the slightest danger.\r\nPoor Lady Malet! I am very sorry for her. She told me people said I had\r\nbeen in a conspiracy with Gladstone against her son's policy in Egypt. I\r\nassured her that Gladstone was guiltless of my telegrams, and that I\r\naccepted the full responsibility of all I had done. She made me promise\r\nto come and see her; but--such are the miseries of political life--she\r\nlooks upon me as Edward's murderer.\r\n\r\n\"_June_ 13._--I was very nervous all night, expecting to hear that Arabi\r\nhad been arrested or murdered. But the papers show him to be quite\r\nmaster of the situation. The Khedive is forming a new Ministry, in which\r\nArabi is to be Minister of War as ever. I trust, therefore, he has\r\nfollowed my advice about making terms with Tewfik. Now they have only to\r\nget Dervish away, and all will go smoothly.\"\r\n\r\nSo thought the majority of the London papers, the \"Pall Mall\" almost\r\nalone dissenting from this view of a peaceful solution having been\r\narrived at, and its comments, prompted by the Foreign Office, show the\r\nanimus of our officials and their determination there should not be\r\npeace on any terms which should leave the Nationalists in power. Morley\r\nthus writes: \"It would be difficult to make a greater mistake than that\r\ninto which the 'Times' has fallen this morning, when it mistakes the\r\ntemporary and provisional arrangement, entered into by the Khedive, the\r\nConsuls-General, Dervish, and Arabi for the preservation of order, for\r\nthe final settlement of the Egyptian difficulty. The excitement in Egypt\r\nis so great that Europeans are in danger of their lives. The only\r\nrestraining force in the country that can hold the mob in awe is the\r\narmy, and the army is in the hands of Arabi. For the moment, then, Arabi\r\nmust be made use of to prevent massacre. But because Dervish holds Arabi\r\nresponsible with his head for the preservation of order, it no more\r\nfollows that he has abandoned the intention to re-establish the _status\r\nquo_ than that England and France have come to terms with Arabi because\r\nthey insisted he should use his troops to suppress the rioting in\r\nAlexandria.\" We were, however, taken in in England, just as Arabi was\r\ntaken in at Cairo, by the treacherous truce Malet and Colvin had agreed\r\nto, and did not suspect its hollowness. Arabi on that occasion gave his\r\nword of honour to Tewfik that, come what might, he would defend his life\r\nlike his own, and this promise the Khedive, who had nothing but\r\ntreachery towards him in his heart, accepted and abused to the end.\r\n\r\nTo continue my journal of that day I find: \"Button told me yesterday\r\nthat Rothschild had offered Arabi £4,000 (one hundred thousand francs) a\r\nyear for life if he would leave Egypt.[19]... As we went up to London\r\nthey gave us the following telegram: 'Cairo, June 12th, 11 a. m. I have\r\njust seen Arabi, he sends you his salaams. He thinks the European\r\nproposals have disappeared and peace is concluded. Arabi master of the\r\nsituation. Dervish gone. Khedive went to Alexandria. Arabi led him by\r\nthe arm to the station. National Party triumphant. I worked hard but\r\nhave triumphed.'... I have been between laughing and crying ever since.\r\nI went at once to Downing Street, and told Eddy Hamilton and Horace\r\nSeymour what had happened. They seemed to think that now, even at the\r\neleventh hour, Gladstone might acknowledge his errors, or rather Malet's\r\nerrors, and make peace with Arabi. Button thinks this possible too. But\r\nthe Foreign Office will harden its heart.... Dined at home and went to a\r\nparty at the Admiralty. Found the Gregorys and Sir Frederick Goldsmid\r\nthere, and had some conversation on Egypt with Lord Northbrook. I spoke\r\nmy mind to him pretty freely. I said, 'It depends entirely upon you now\r\nwhether there is bloodshed in Egypt or not.'\r\n\r\n\"_June 14._--I am quite worn out. Mrs. Howard, whom I met in the Park,\r\nsaid I looked altered. And in fact I have not had Egypt, sleeping or\r\nwaking, out of my head since the crisis began.... I spent the morning\r\nand breakfasted with Goldsmid, who is going this evening on a special\r\nmission to Constantinople, and primed him well with my views, showing\r\nhim all my Gladstone correspondence.\" (_N. B._--This General Goldsmid\r\nwas afterwards employed as chief of the Intelligence Department by\r\nWolseley in his campaign. He was a soft-spoken man, whom I had known the\r\nyear before at Cairo.)... \"Had luncheon with Lascelles, who seems to\r\nagree with my views about Egypt.\" (There was some thought, I believe, at\r\nthat time at the Foreign Office of his being sent out to Cairo to\r\nreplace Malet, as he already knew Egypt; and on a mission of\r\nconciliation he would have done well. Only, unfortunately, none such was\r\ndecided on.)... \"There is confirmation of Sabunji's news in to-day's\r\n'Daily Telegraph.' The other papers look upon the Khedive's and\r\nDervish's flight as caused by their desire to restore order at\r\nAlexandria. They say Dervish will put himself at the head of 12,000 men\r\nwho have been massed there and march against Arabi, who is now alone at\r\nCairo(!). I have telegraphed to Arabi: 'Praise God for victory and\r\npeace.'\"\r\n\r\nThis was the last point at which it seemed to me possible that the long\r\ngame I had been playing against Colvin could be won and war averted.\r\nHenceforth it was a losing battle, though I fought it out to the end.\r\nThe determining cause with Gladstone, in whom alone salvation lay, was,\r\nI believe, about this date when certain industrial towns of the North of\r\nEngland protested against the dilatory character of the Government\r\ntreatment of the Egyptian case, on the ground that the long continuance\r\nof the crisis there was injuring trade. This was used upon him as a\r\nmeans of coercion by Chamberlain, egged on by Dilke, in the Cabinet.\r\n\r\n\"_June 15._--I am anxious about the state of things at Alexandria, but\r\nsuppose Arabi can depend upon his men. There is a general stampede there\r\nand at Cairo. Malet, I am thankful to say, has left Cairo. Dervish still\r\nhangs on at Alexandria. He and the Khedive have gone to Ras-el-Tin\r\nPalace, where they are under the guns of the fleet.... Another telegram\r\nfrom Sabunji as follows: 'The Khedive's departure has aroused suspicion.\r\nAgitation. Activity in army preparations. Nadim, Abdu and the army\r\nopenly defy the Porte. Arabi is moderate and vigilant. A plot to murder\r\nNadim. There is danger of serious disturbance on European side. Dervish\r\ndeclines retiring till the fleet is withdrawn. Recall Malet for God's\r\nsake. All curse and will murder him if he continues.' I went at once to\r\nEddy Hamilton and implored him to get Malet ordered on board ship\" (this\r\nwas done) \"and afterwards sent him (Hamilton) a letter warning the\r\nGovernment not to count on Turkish troops. We then sent an answer to\r\nSabunji: 'Turkish Commissioner demands troops from Constantinople. They\r\nare not likely to be sent. But prepare. Keep order at all costs. Another\r\nriot would be fatal. Malet leaves soon. Patience.'... Dined at Lord De\r\nla Warr's.... On coming home found the telegraph to Cairo interrupted,\r\nby the flight, I suppose, of the Eastern Telegraph clerks. This alarms\r\nme a little.\r\n\r\n\"_June 16._--Went to see Button, who is very hopeful. But I am losing my\r\nfaith in Gladstone and think the English Government means mischief. I\r\ngave my Gladstone correspondence yesterday to Kegan Paul to put in\r\nprint, so as to have it ready in case of the worst.... My telegram has\r\ngone after all.... In low spirits. Another telegram from Sabunji: 'New\r\nCommissioner with unknown instructions arrived. Nation and army in\r\ncounsel daily to devise defensive plans. They distrust the double\r\nCommission. Inform me of Gladstone's policy and of Lord Granville's.\r\nArabi is firm. All the journals closed except the \"Wattan\" and the\r\n\"Official Journal.\" Panic among foreigners. The Khedive has thanked\r\nArabi for keeping order. All is quiet. Nadim has been stopped from\r\ncalling public meetings.'\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday when I saw Eddy he told me I had better not return to Downing\r\nStreet as my visits there were remarked on, but to write him any news I\r\nmight receive. Now I have written him yet another letter to try and find\r\nout what Gladstone's policy really is. Eddy's answer, however, is very\r\nunsatisfactory. There is a sensational announcement in the 'St. James's\r\nGazette' of British troops ordered to Egypt. Home to Crabbet in a very\r\nnervous state. I see that a hurried meeting of the Cabinet was called\r\nyesterday in Mr. Gladstone's private room. Can this ordering of troops\r\nhave been the consequence? I cannot help thinking they mean to push on\r\nan intervention. The French, however, have apparently made their peace\r\nwith Arabi.\"\r\n\r\nNot the French only, but the other European Powers, especially Germany\r\nand Austria, were at that moment in a mood to come to terms with him and\r\nto sacrifice Tewfik, for the preservation of order's sake. The \"Pall\r\nMall Gazette\" of 16th June says: \"The German Powers are supposed to\r\nadvocate an arrangement with Arabi on the basis of Tewfik's abdication\r\nin favour of his son with a regency.... There are many points in its\r\nfavour, though 'the solemn obligations of England and France' may make\r\nit impossible for them to do otherwise than stand by the man who has\r\nimplicitly followed their counsels--especially those of the English\r\nRepresentative--it is perfectly conceivable that the practical failure\r\nof Tewfik, personal as well as political, may have impressed the other\r\nPowers with the expediency of by and by finding some more capable\r\nsubstitute.\" Compare, too, Malet's despatch of June 14: \"The Agents of\r\nAustria and Germany have telegraphed to their Governments that the\r\neffect of any armed intervention, not excepting Turkish, will place the\r\nlives of their countrymen in danger. They consider the political\r\nquestion as a secondary matter compared with the security of their\r\nfellow subjects. With this object they are in favour of leaving the\r\nmatter entirely in the hands of the Porte, and they believe that the\r\nonly means of avoiding the most serious calamities is the departure from\r\nAlexandria of the fleet and myself.\" Poor Malet at this date, I have\r\nheard, spoke to his friends of his professional career as ruined. All\r\ndepended for him and Colvin on bringing on hostilities.\r\n\r\n\"_June 17._--Very troubled night. But there is no confirmation of the\r\nnews about the troops in to-day's papers; and the day is so fine, I feel\r\nagain light-hearted. The Sultan dares not interfere. That is proved. The\r\nFrench have made their terms with Arabi, and it is hinted that Germany\r\nand Austria are doing likewise. So England does not matter.\r\n\r\n\"The following is our party at Crabbet: Ebrington, Lymington, Granny\r\nFarquhar, Eddy Hamilton, Dallas (of the Foreign Office), Nigel Kingscote\r\n(junior), Button Bourke, and Walter Seymour. News of despatch of troops\r\ncontradicted. All seems going well. We have agreed to talk nothing about\r\nEgypt. But we cannot help it.\r\n\r\n\"_June 18._--Sunday, Waterloo day, and never did England look more\r\nfoolish. I got a telegram at breakfast announcing a new Ministry under\r\nRagheb and Arabi, evidently consented to by the German Powers and\r\nTurkey. We are consequently singing Hallelujahs.\"\r\n\r\nHere I may as well insert three more of Sabunji's letters, which he\r\nwrote in these last days. They throw a valuable light on what was\r\npassing in the Nationalist mind at Cairo:\r\n\r\n     \"Cairo, _June 14, 1882_.\r\n\r\n     \"I called to-day on Arabi Pasha just a few minutes after he\r\n     received your telegram. We talked for about an hour and a half. I\r\n     asked him why this panic in the country if he and the Khedive had\r\n     already come to terms. He said: 'As far as I am concerned I believe\r\n     the Khedive would be sincere in his dealing with me, if left alone\r\n     and far from Sir E. Malet's advice. He has by this time become\r\n     convinced that there is nobody in his Government who could control\r\n     the country and preserve peace except the man whom European\r\n     statesmen despise, Ahmed Arabi. The Khedive has now made peace\r\n     with me, and in the presence of the Representatives of the six\r\n     European Powers and of Dervish Pasha, has asked me to take on\r\n     myself the responsibility of public safety. I have accepted his\r\n     order, and pledged my word and sworn to defend his life and the\r\n     lives of all who inhabit Egypt, of every creed and nation; and, as\r\n     long as I live and my jurisdiction is not interfered with, I will\r\n     keep my word. But, if this peace is looked upon by others as a\r\n     fictitious and fraudulent peace, that is the Khedive's lookout. For\r\n     myself, I am sincere in my dealing with all who deal honestly and\r\n     sincerely with me; but with those who deal dishonestly I pay them\r\n     with their own coin, and with the fraudulent I am doubly\r\n     fraudulent. Time and Ismaïl, in spite of us, have trained us to\r\n     Turkish deceit. As we make use of the arms, guns and ammunition\r\n     they left us, so we make use of their deceit, _when the Turks force\r\n     us to do so_. We will not be the aggressors, but we will resist all\r\n     who attempt to attack us. We are a sincere nation, and grateful to\r\n     those who take us by the hand and help us to reform our country. We\r\n     wish for nothing except reforms' (he uttered that with emphasis).\r\n     'But those who would cheat us will find us the very roots of fraud,\r\n     _sudar el ghish_. Europe, and especially England, looks upon us as\r\n     barbarians. They can crush us, they say, in twenty-four hours.\r\n     Well, if they are willing, let them try it, but they will lose\r\n     their 80 millions of public debt and the 20 millions the fellahin\r\n     privately owe to the bankers. The first shot fired will release us\r\n     from these engagements; and the nation on this account wishes\r\n     nothing more than war.'\r\n\r\n     \"I hear much the same language from every one. Great preparations\r\n     are going on. Vast stores of rifles and ammunition have been found,\r\n     laid up by Ismaïl when he intended to make himself independent of\r\n     the Porte. These they will make good use of. But I tell them I hope\r\n     there will be no occasion. They say they can resist for years, for\r\n     God has blessed them with a crop this summer twice as great as in\r\n     ordinary fertile years.\r\n\r\n     \"I sounded Arabi about Halim. I found him to prefer Halim to\r\n     Tewfik, but he says that if Tewfik will only free himself from\r\n     Malet's influence all will go well. Malet, he says, has been misled\r\n     by Colvin, and has done immense harm to his own country, as well\r\n     as Egypt, by their misrepresentation of facts.\r\n\r\n     \"_June 17._--Last night I went to Shereï Pasha's, where Arabi,\r\n     Mahmud Sami, Abd-el-Aal, Ali Fehmi, Nadim, Hajrasi and many others\r\n     were being entertained at dinner. After they had dined and we were\r\n     smoking and talking politics, an officer came in with a letter from\r\n     an English lady asking protection, as she had been advised to leave\r\n     Cairo. I was begged to write her an answer at once to assure her\r\n     there was no danger, and that if there should be trouble Arabi\r\n     would protect her life as his own. Arabi has become a hero with\r\n     many of the European ladies, whom I have heard praising him for the\r\n     protection he has given. When he drives through the town all rush\r\n     to the windows and balconies. I make converts to the National\r\n     Party, all I can, among the Europeans I meet.\r\n\r\n     \"_June 18._--Yesterday at noon, on Ragheb being telegraphed as\r\n     Prime Minister, I went to see Arabi, who read me a telegram just\r\n     received from the Khedive requesting him to co-operate with Ragheb\r\n     as Minister of War. After coffee had been served he wrote a\r\n     telegram of thanks to the Khedive and handed it to me. It was very\r\n     politely worded. A few minutes afterwards he said: 'Let us go for a\r\n     drive through the town to inspire confidence in the minds of the\r\n     people.' He and Ali Fehmi drove in one carriage, and I and Nadim in\r\n     the other. We went through Faggala, preceded by heralds. We\r\n     alighted at Embabeh's house (the Sheykh el Islam's), and Arabi\r\n     said, 'Come in, I will introduce you to our Pope.' On entering the\r\n     reception room Arabi took off his boots, and turning to me said,\r\n     'We consider this place as the holy abode of our Sheykh.'\r\n     Accordingly I did the same. On entering, the Sheykh, who was\r\n     sitting on a low divan, rose and advanced a few paces towards\r\n     Arabi, who saluted him and kissed his hands. I only shook hands\r\n     with him, and he invited us to take seats. There were several of\r\n     the Azhar Sheykhs with him, among them the son of Arusi. At first\r\n     they talked about the situation and the new Ministry. Then the\r\n     conversation turned on Embabeh's dealings with the Khedive during\r\n     the late events. From all I saw I conclude that the report of a\r\n     coolness having taken place between Embabeh and Arabi was not true.\r\n     While Embabeh was concluding his narrative coffee was served, and\r\n     Arabi introduced me formally to him, and explained that I was a\r\n     friend of Mr. Blunt. Embabeh then explained to me all about the\r\n     telegram. He had written the answer, he said, with his own hand,\r\n     thinking the telegram addressed to him; but he had never apologized\r\n     to the Khedive about it. He believes Sir E. Malet heard of it\r\n     originally through Sultan Pasha, or some of the Khedive's\r\n     adherents.\r\n\r\n     \"Next Arabi showed Embabeh a proclamation he had made guaranteeing\r\n     the lives and properties of all the inhabitants of Egypt, whatever\r\n     their creed or nation, and Arabi begged him to write a similar one,\r\n     showing, as Sheykh el Islam, that the Mohammedan religion, far from\r\n     allowing, forbids Moslems to hurt Christians, Jews, or others, and\r\n     commands the faithful to protect them. Embabeh agreed to this, and,\r\n     in my presence and that of the other four Sheykhs, prayed God to\r\n     help him to succeed in reforming the country. He also promised to\r\n     help him in fostering peace between Mohammedans and others,\r\n     inasmuch as all were brothers notwithstanding the diversity of\r\n     creeds.\r\n\r\n     \"We then went on to Artin Bey's, where also we were entertained\r\n     with great honour, and afterwards drove through the Clot Bey Road,\r\n     the Mouski, and other parts of the town, while the people stood on\r\n     both sides saying, 'May God exalt you.'\r\n\r\n     \"At the end of the drive Arabi told me he was invited to dine with\r\n     Seyd Hassan Akkad, and took me with him, with all the pashas,\r\n     officers, sheykhs, and Ulemas. Our host's large house was crowded;\r\n     Arabi, Mahmud Sami, Ahmed Pasha, Abdu, Nadim, and I were in the\r\n     principal sitting-room, where we recited poetry, making or\r\n     composing elegies and satires, and amusing ourselves at Ragheb's\r\n     expense. Arabi composed a satire, Abdu two, Nadim made four, and\r\n     Sami two. At dinner I sat by Arabi. The courses were about thirty\r\n     different Arab dishes, besides the European and Eastern cakes,\r\n     sweetmeats and fruit.\r\n\r\n     \"After dinner we talked freely about politics, and about different\r\n     plans and forms of government. The republican form was preferred;\r\n     and Mahmud Sami, who displayed great knowledge and ingenuity,\r\n     endeavoured to show the advantage of a republican government for\r\n     Egypt. He said: 'From the beginning of our movement we aimed at\r\n     turning Egypt into a small republic like Switzerland--and then\r\n     Syria would have joined--and then Hejaz would have followed us.\r\n     But we found some of the Ulema were not quite prepared for it and\r\n     were behind our time. Nevertheless we shall endeavour to make Egypt\r\n     a republic before we die. We all hope to see the \"Saturnia regna\"\r\n     once more.'\r\n\r\n     \"_June 19._--Abdu, Nadim, Sami, and I were talking the night before\r\n     last about the peaceful means to be taken to tide over the Egyptian\r\n     difficulty. Abdu said that he has made up his mind to get together\r\n     all the documents he has in his possession, with others concerning\r\n     Egyptian affairs, and go to England and depose them himself before\r\n     Mr. Gladstone and the English Parliament. He would take also with\r\n     him a worthy person as representative of the leading merchants of\r\n     the land; and another who would represent the liberal fellahin.\r\n     Mahmud Sami approved the idea, and said he also wished he could go\r\n     to Europe on such a mission, and Abdu is already preparing for the\r\n     journey. So is Nadim and Seyyid Hassan Moussa el Akkad, the leading\r\n     Arab merchant of Cairo, a man of considerable wealth, influence,\r\n     and patriotism.\r\n\r\n     \"Ragheb is made Prime Minister, but his policy being Turkish nobody\r\n     is pleased with him except the Circassians. People suspect some\r\n     Ottoman intrigue in the matter and are very uneasy. I am trying to\r\n     calm their minds and tell them to keep quiet.\r\n\r\n     \"The last events have increased the hatred in the Arab heart\r\n     against the Turks, Circassians, and the Sultan himself. I heard\r\n     Sami and Abdu and Nadim curse the Sultans and all the Turkish\r\n     generation from Genjis Khan to Holagu and down to Abdul Hamid. They\r\n     are preparing the nation for a republican form of government. A\r\n     large party is already formed and disposed; _crescit eundo_. They\r\n     will seize upon the first occasion which presents itself. They\r\n     expect the armed intervention of Turkish troops with pleasure in\r\n     this last crisis. It would have been the signal for a complete\r\n     independence from the Porte. But the cunning Turk saw the danger\r\n     and abstained. Nadim told me yesterday, while we were coming from\r\n     Shubra, that he must, before he dies, crush down the Sultan's\r\n     throne. ---- said: 'This is my aim too--may God help us to\r\n     succeed.'\r\n\r\n     \"I must tell you that I have been received here with such honour,\r\n     respect, and politeness as I never could dream of. All the pashas,\r\n     colonels, sheykhs, merchants receive me with open arms, and lavish\r\n     upon me their kindness and hearty thanks. We have arranged with\r\n     Nadim to give a dinner party to all the leaders of the National\r\n     Party in your honour, and to thank you for the help given them in\r\n     their struggle.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Cairo, _June 22_.\r\n\r\n     \"Last night I went to Mahmud Sami's house, where I met all our\r\n     friends and the Pashas and many other of the leaders. We talked\r\n     politics all night, and I communicated to them the contents of your\r\n     letters received to-day by Brindisi. I also gave them a summary of\r\n     the English newspapers you and Lady Anne had sent me. Afterwards I\r\n     presented to Mahmud Sami, in the presence of Nadim, a petition on\r\n     the part of the National Party, in which they ask Mr. Gladstone to\r\n     send to Egypt a Consul who understands the affairs of their\r\n     country. Sami approved the petition and said they will have it\r\n     signed when Arabi Pasha comes back to Cairo and present it to Mr.\r\n     Gladstone through you. At the end of the _soirée_ I was informed\r\n     that Sir E. Malet has for the fourth time urged Tewfik to arrest\r\n     Abdu, Nadim, Mahmud Sami, and myself.\r\n\r\n     \"_June 23._--As soon as Ragheb Pasha was confirmed by the Khedive\r\n     as Prime Minister, his first act and order was to call me to\r\n     Alexandria with Nadim. On Monday night the Under-Secretary sent his\r\n     carriage to my hotel with his man, who informed me that Hassan\r\n     Pasha Daramalli wished to see me, and had sent his carriage. I went\r\n     with Nadim, not trusting myself to go alone. When we got there we\r\n     were received courteously, and afterwards he informed me that\r\n     Ragheb Pasha had charged him with a message that he wished me to go\r\n     and meet him at Alexandria at the Divan of the Administration. I\r\n     replied 'very well,' and Nadim said he, too, would go with me. And\r\n     so we left the house with the firm intention of having nothing to\r\n     do with Ragheb.\r\n\r\n     \"Thus at the very time I was telegraphing to you, 'for God's sake\r\n     save Malet or he will be murdered by fanatics,' he was urging the\r\n     Khedive to arrest me. Often, when hot-headed young Egyptians were\r\n     discussing Malet and Colvin's death, I endeavoured to convince them\r\n     of their folly, and that no possible good result could come of it\r\n     to the National cause.\r\n\r\n     \"_June 24._--Mahmud Pasha Fellaki, who had deserted the National\r\n     cause on account of his not having received a place in Mahmud\r\n     Sami's Ministry, has now been reconciled and has received from\r\n     Arabi the post of Minister of Public Works.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(Sabunji then describes the crisis preceding Mahmud Sami's resignation,\r\nArabi's appeal to the Sultan, Dervish's mission and Osman Bey's mission,\r\nand how they flattered Abdul Hamid with professions of zeal for the\r\nCaliphate.) \"As to their real convictions, however, they care for Abdul\r\nHamid as much as they would care for a man in the moon. They would make\r\nuse of him as long as he can be useful to them and until they are strong\r\nenough to declare themselves an independent republic. This has been the\r\nbasis of their program from the beginning. But they have prudently\r\nchosen to proceed by degrees. Mahmud Pasha Sami assured me in Nadim and\r\nAbdu's presence that before they die they must declare themselves\r\nindependent of the Porte, and Egypt a republic. Nadim's efforts are\r\nemployed to instill this idea in the minds of the young generation.\r\nSince I came here I and Nadim have been together night and day. We sit\r\ntalking and devising plans till one or two every morning. We mix in\r\nevery society. Sheykhs, Ulemas, Notables, merchants, and officers\r\nreceive us with open arms, and we talk to them of your endeavours and of\r\nthe service which you have rendered to the National cause. They all long\r\nto see you and present you with their hearty thanks. Indeed, people so\r\ngood and sincerely kind deserve every attention and help.\"\r\n\r\nI am not able to fix an exact date to the moment when Gladstone finally\r\nhardened his heart against the Egyptians and resolved on military\r\noperations--he persuaded himself that it would not be war--but it must\r\nhave been some time between the 20th June and the end of the month. The\r\nconsiderations that seem to have decided him were, first, of course,\r\nparliamentary ones. His Whig followers were on the point of a revolt,\r\nand Chamberlain was pressing him with tales of the impatience of the\r\nprovinces. The diplomatic defeat of the Foreign Office was becoming\r\ntoo plain to be concealed. Granville, with his little maxims of\r\nprocrastination and using a threat as if it were a blow, had \"dawdled it\r\nout\" in Egypt till England had become the laughing-stock of Europe. On\r\nthe Stock Exchange things were looking badly and trade was suffering\r\nfrom the long crisis. What were called the \"resources of civilization,\"\r\nthat is to say, lying, treachery and fraud, had been tried by the\r\nForeign Office to more than their extreme limit, and one and all had\r\nproved absolutely of no use against the Nationalist obstinacy. Arabi had\r\nbeen ordered by all the majesty of England to leave Egypt, and he had\r\nnot gone. On the contrary he had gained an immense reputation throughout\r\nthe Mohammedan East at England's expense. It seemed to many that there\r\nwould be a Pan-Islamic revolt in India. England, as I had said on\r\nWaterloo day, had never looked so foolish. Serious officials were\r\nalarmed at this, and all the jingoism of the Empire, asleep since\r\nDisraeli's parliamentary defeat in 1880, was suddenly awake and crying\r\nfor blood. Mr. Gladstone hardened his heart and let his conscience go,\r\nnot, I think, by any deliberate decision saying that this or that should\r\nbe done, but simply by leaving it to the \"departments,\" and to the \"men\r\non the spot,\" that is to say, the Admiralty, Sir Beauchamp Seymour, and\r\nColvin (for Malet had been withdrawn) to work out a solution their own\r\nway. We had won our diplomatic game against the Foreign Office too\r\nthoroughly. It was to be the turn now of England's fighting forces.\r\n\r\n\"_June 19._--A Stock Exchange scare of Bright and Chamberlain having\r\nresigned\" (a scare which showed the ignorance of the public as to\r\nChamberlain's position, classing him still with Bright).\r\n\r\n\"_June 20._--A more reasonable article in the 'Daily News.' Frederic\r\nHarrison strongly advises me to write Gladstone a public letter and have\r\nit printed. He is prepared to answer for its effect in the provinces. I\r\nhave accordingly begun one.\r\n\r\n\"_June 21._--Finished my letter and took it to the Howards for approval.\r\nHe (George Howard) made me modify some sentences, so as not to\r\ncompromise Gladstone personally. She warmly approved. Frank Lascelles\r\nwas there. I then arranged with Button to publish it tomorrow, or Friday\r\nat latest, and sent it in to Gladstone.\r\n\r\n\"_June 22._--To Button early. We think they mean mischief after all.\r\nHarry Brand writes that if the French hold out on the Note the\r\nGovernment mean to act in Egypt, notwithstanding Germany. I doubt,\r\nhowever, if France is prepared for this. I shall follow up my letter (to\r\nGladstone) with other letters, if necessary. I am certain that if\r\nEngland lands troops anywhere in Egypt, the Sultan will proclaim a Jehad\r\nand that the Mussulmans will rise in India. Things are in a pretty\r\npass.\"\r\n\r\nMy letter to Gladstone appeared in the \"Times\" on the following day,\r\n23rd June, the very day the Conference met at Constantinople. It created\r\na great sensation. It stands thus:\r\n\r\n     \"_June 21st, 1882._\r\n\r\n     \"SIR,\r\n\r\n     \"The gravity of the present situation in Egypt, and the interests\r\n     of honour and advantage to the English nation which are there\r\n     engaged, impel me to address you publicly on the subject of the\r\n     diplomatic steps which have led to this imbroglio, and to put on\r\n     record certain facts which, in the case of any new departure taken\r\n     by the Powers at the approaching Conference, should not be lost\r\n     sight of.\r\n\r\n     \"You are aware, sir, that during the past winter I was engaged as\r\n     mediator in a variety of unofficial but important negotiations\r\n     carried on between Sir Edward Malet and Sir Auckland Colvin on the\r\n     one hand, and the chiefs of the National Egyptian party on the\r\n     other, negotiations in which I engaged my personal honour to the\r\n     loyalty of Her Majesty's agents; also that I have been in close\r\n     communication with those chiefs since my return to England, and\r\n     that I am consequently in a position to speak with certainty and\r\n     authority as to the character and intentions of the popular\r\n     movement in Egypt. You know, moreover, that I have from time to\r\n     time warned Her Majesty's Government of the danger they were\r\n     running from a false appreciation of facts, and that I have\r\n     repeatedly urged the necessity of their coming to a rapid\r\n     understanding with those in whose hands the guidance of the\r\n     movement lay. Finally, you know that in the interests of right and\r\n     justice, and in accordance with a promise made by me to the\r\n     Egyptians, I have counselled them to the best of my ability in the\r\n     recent crisis, and spared no pains to urge them to come to that\r\n     settlement of their difficulties with the Khedive, Mohammed Tewfik,\r\n     at which they have now happily arrived. In this I took upon myself\r\n     a great responsibility, but one which, I think, the event has\r\n     already justified.\r\n\r\n     \"The main points in the past which I would state are these:\r\n\r\n     \"1. In the month of December last I assisted the National Party to\r\n     publish a program of their views, which was just and liberal, and\r\n     to which they have since rigidly adhered. At this time, and down to\r\n     the publication of the Dual Note of the 8th of January, the\r\n     Egyptians had no quarrel whatever with England or the English.\r\n     Neither had they any real quarrel with the Khedive or the Control,\r\n     trusting in these to permit the development of political liberty in\r\n     their country in the direction of Parliamentary and constitutional\r\n     self-government. Their aim was, and is, the resumption by Egypt of\r\n     her position as a nation, the redemption of her debt, and the\r\n     reform of justice. They trusted then, as now, to the army, which\r\n     was and is their servant, to secure them these rights, and to their\r\n     Parliament to secure them these ends; and they were prepared to\r\n     advance gradually, and with moderation, in the path they had\r\n     traced.\r\n\r\n     \"2. The Dual Note, drawn up by M. Gambetta with the view of making\r\n     England a partner of his anti-Mussulman policy and understood by\r\n     the Egyptians as the first step in a policy analogous to that\r\n     recently pursued in Tunis, changed this confidence into a sentiment\r\n     of profound distrust. Instead of awing them, it precipitated their\r\n     action. It caused them to insist upon the resignation of Sherif\r\n     Pasha, whom they suspected of the design to betray them, and to\r\n     assist with the Khedive in summoning a Nationalist Ministry to\r\n     office. This insistence, though represented by the English journals\r\n     as the work of the army, was, in fact, the work of the nation\r\n     through their representatives the Notables. Of this I can furnish\r\n     ample evidence.\r\n\r\n     \"3. The unexpected fall of M. Gambetta prevented the execution of\r\n     the threat of armed intervention implied by the Dual Note.\r\n     Nevertheless, a plan of indirect intervention was persisted in. The\r\n     English and French Controllers-General protested against the\r\n     Constitution granted by the Khedive on the 6th of February, and the\r\n     English and French Governments carefully withheld their assent to\r\n     it, signifying only that the Article, giving to the Egyptian\r\n     Parliament the right of voting that half of the Budget which was\r\n     not affected to the payment of the Debt, was an infringement of\r\n     international engagements. Their argument for this, based on\r\n     certain firmans of the Porte, and certain decrees of the Khedive,\r\n     has been constantly denied by the Egyptians.\r\n\r\n     \"4. Acting, it must be presumed, in accordance with their\r\n     instructions, the English agents at Cairo have for the past three\r\n     months set themselves steadily to work to bring about a revolution\r\n     counter to the will of the people and the liberties granted to them\r\n     by the Viceroy. The English Controller-General, though a paid agent\r\n     of the Egyptian Government, has not scrupled to take part in this;\r\n     and the English Resident Minister has spared no pains to create a\r\n     quarrel between the Khedive and his Ministers. The\r\n     Controller-General, sitting in council with the Ministers as their\r\n     official adviser, has withheld his advice, counting, it would seem,\r\n     on the mistakes likely to be made by men new to office, and noting\r\n     these in silence. The English press correspondents, hitherto held\r\n     in check by the Resident, have been permitted full license in the\r\n     dissemination of news injurious to the Ministry, and known to be\r\n     false. I will venture to recall to you some of the scares reported\r\n     at this time and disseminated through Europe--the scare of banditti\r\n     in the Delta; the scare of the Bedouin rising; the scare of revolt\r\n     in the Soudan; the scare of an Abyssinian war; the scare of huge\r\n     military expenditure; the scare of a general refusal to pay taxes,\r\n     of the resignation of the provincial governors, of the neglect of\r\n     the irrigation works, of danger to the Suez Canal; the scare of\r\n     Arabi Pasha having become the bribed agent, in turn, of Ismaïl, of\r\n     Halim, and of the Sultan.\r\n\r\n     \"For some of these a very slight foundation may have existed in\r\n     fact; for most there was no foundation whatsoever.\r\n\r\n     \"On the 20th of March I addressed Lord Granville, by Arabi Pasha's\r\n     request, on this subject, and pointed out to him the danger caused\r\n     to peace in Egypt through the attitude of the English agents urging\r\n     that a Commission should be sent to Cairo to examine into Egyptian\r\n     grievances.\r\n\r\n     \"In the month of April advantage was taken by the English and\r\n     French Consuls-General of the discovery of a plot to assassinate\r\n     the National Ministry, and traced by these to an agent of Ismaïl\r\n     Pasha's, to induce the Khedive to put himself in open opposition to\r\n     his Ministers. Those implicated in the plot and condemned to\r\n     banishment were men of position, Turks and Circassians, and as such\r\n     of the same race and society with the Khedive and he was unwilling\r\n     to ratify their sentence, and suffered himself to be persuaded to\r\n     refuse his signature. This led to the rupture which the previous\r\n     diplomatic action of the Consuls-General had prepared. A summons\r\n     was then sent by Mahmud Sami Pasha to the Deputies to come to Cairo\r\n     and decide between the Ministers and the Khedive, and the Deputies\r\n     came. Sultan Pasha, however, through jealousy, refused to preside\r\n     at any formal sitting; and advantage was again taken of the\r\n     circumstance by the Consuls-General to encourage all who were in\r\n     opposition to the National Party to rally round the Khedive. A\r\n     section of the rich Egyptians, fearing disturbance, sided with the\r\n     Circassians, and the Consuls-General, deceived by appearances,\r\n     ventured a _coup de main_. An _ultimatum_, dictated by them, was\r\n     sent in to the Ministers, insisting on the resignation of the\r\n     Ministry and Arabi Pasha's departure from the country. The step for\r\n     an instant seemed to have succeeded, for the Ministry resigned. It\r\n     became, however, immediately apparent that the feeling of the\r\n     country had been miscalculated by our diplomacy, and Arabi, by the\r\n     manifest will of the nation, returned next day to power.\r\n\r\n     \"I cannot understand that the action of our Consul-General in this\r\n     matter was justified by any principle of Liberal policy; it has\r\n     certainly not been justified by success.\r\n\r\n     \"6. When the Fleet was ordered to Alexandria, I endeavoured to\r\n     convey a warning, as my private opinion, based upon all I had\r\n     witnessed last winter of the temper of the Egyptian people, that\r\n     the presence of English men-of-war at that moment in the port of\r\n     Alexandria, especially if their crews should be allowed on any\r\n     pretence to land, would be exceedingly likely to provoke a serious\r\n     disturbance and it was my intention to go myself to Egypt to do\r\n     what I could towards mitigating what I feared would be the results.\r\n\r\n     \"7. About the same time the English Government consented to the\r\n     despatch of a Turkish Commissioner to Cairo. It was supposed that\r\n     the authority of the Sultan was so great in Egypt that obedience\r\n     would be shown to whatever orders his representative might bring,\r\n     or that, at any rate, little opposition would be offered. In any\r\n     case, the Porte was authorized to act in its own way. Dervish Pasha\r\n     was sent; and it is lamentable to record that the English Foreign\r\n     Office at that time seems to have counted mainly on the fact that\r\n     he was a man notoriously unscrupulous in his method of dealing with\r\n     rebels. I have reason to know that what was expected of him was,\r\n     that he should summon Arabi Pasha to Constantinople; that, failing\r\n     this, he should have recourse to bribery; and that in the extreme\r\n     resort, he should arrest or shoot the Minister of War as a mutineer\r\n     with his own hand. Whether these were really Dervish Pasha's\r\n     instructions or intentions I will not argue. The Porte seems to\r\n     have been as little prepared as Her Majesty's Government were for\r\n     the strength of the National feeling in Egypt; and only the union\r\n     and courage shown by the people would seem to have convinced the\r\n     Sultan that methods such as those formerly used by Dervish against\r\n     the Albanians would here be out of place. Humaner counsels have in\r\n     any case prevailed, and peace has been recommended between the\r\n     Khedive and his people.\r\n\r\n     \"Such, sir, is shortly the history of England's diplomatic action\r\n     in Egypt during the past six months. It is one of the most\r\n     deplorable our Foreign Office has to record. The future, however,\r\n     in some measure remains to us, though, when the Conference\r\n     assembles, England's will be only one of many voices raised in the\r\n     settlement. It is not for me to suggest the words which should\r\n     there be spoken; but I will venture to express my conviction that\r\n     if Her Majesty's representative then comes forward with an honest\r\n     confession of the mistakes made, and a declaration of England's\r\n     sympathy with Egyptian freedom, England will regain her lost\r\n     ground. In spite of the just anger of the Egyptians at the unworthy\r\n     tricks which have been played upon them by our Foreign Office, they\r\n     believe that a more generous feeling exists in the body of the\r\n     English nation, which would not suffer so vast a public wrong to be\r\n     committed as the subjugation of their country for a misunderstood\r\n     interest in Egyptian finance and in the Suez Canal. They have, over\r\n     and over again, assured me, and I know that they speak truly, that\r\n     their only aim is peace, independence, and economy; and that the\r\n     Suez Canal cannot be better protected for England, as for the rest\r\n     of the world, than by the admission of the Egyptian people into the\r\n     comity of nations. Only let the hand of friendship be held out to\r\n     them freely, and at once, and we shall still earn their gratitude.\r\n\r\n     \"I am, Sir, your obedient Servant,\r\n\r\n     \"WILFRID SCAWEN BLUNT.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[19] Arabi, in answer to a question of mine as to this matter, told me\r\nmany years afterwards that he had never heard of any offer of a pension\r\n_as made him by the Rothschilds_. He said, however, that soon after the\r\nultimatum of 26th May, he received a visit from the French Consul, who,\r\nhaving asked what was the amount of his then pay, had offered him the\r\ndouble--that is to say, E£500 a month--from the French Government, if he\r\nwould consent to leave Egypt and go to Paris to be treated there as\r\nAbd-el-Kader had been treated. He refused, however, to have anything to\r\ndo with it, telling him that it was his business if necessary to fight\r\nand die for his country, not to abandon it. I have a note of this\r\nconversation but without date. Compare also the \"Pall Mall\" of 18th May:\r\n\"Ourabi is said to be thinking of visiting Europe to recruit his\r\nhealth--a commendable intention, and no harm would be done if he were\r\nalotted a handsome travelling allowance on condition that he did not\r\nreturn.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE BOMBARDMENT OF ALEXANDRIA\r\n\r\n\r\nWe now come to the bombardment of Alexandria, a quarrel deliberately\r\npicked by Admiral Seymour and Colvin acting in concert, for the removal\r\nof Malet only put the diplomatic power more entirely into Colvin's\r\nhands. Malet was replaced, not as I had hoped by Lascelles, whose\r\nindependence of character and knowledge of Egypt might have enabled him\r\nto take a line of his own, but by a simple Foreign Office clerk named\r\nCartwright, who, ignorant and helpless, was a mere passive tool directed\r\nby the Controller. I have not much to add to the public records of those\r\nlast three weeks at Cairo and Alexandria, but my diary will give an idea\r\nof what was going on in London. My public letter to Gladstone called\r\ndown a storm of abuse upon my head from Malet's and Colvin's friends,\r\nand generally from the Jingo and financial elements in the Press and\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n\"_June 24._--There is an angry letter from Henry Malet (Edward Malet's\r\nelder brother) in to-day's 'Times.'... Lord Lamington, too, has given\r\nnotice of a question as to my 'unofficial negotiations' in the House of\r\nLords for Monday. The more talk the better.... A party of people (at\r\nCrabbet) for Sunday, Lascelles among them.\r\n\r\n\"_June 25._--Wrote an answer to Henry Malet and sent it to the 'Times.'\r\nA soft answer turneth away wrath.\" (I was loath to quarrel in this way\r\nwith old friends, and I was resolved not to hit back except on\r\ncompulsion.)\r\n\r\n\"_June 26._--A long letter has come from Sabunji (that already given in\r\nthe last chapter). They are giving a public dinner in my honour at\r\nCairo.... Met Lords De la Warr and Lamington (they were brothers-in-law)\r\nat the House of Lords, and got the former to ask for Malet's despatch\r\nof December 26th (that which Malet had said he had cancelled). Lord\r\nLamington was going to have based his speech on Henry Malet's letter,\r\nbut I showed him what nonsense this was. All the same he made a very\r\nstrong speech in an indignant tone about me. Lord Granville looked white\r\nand uncomfortable, but admitted the fact of my having acted on one\r\noccasion to pacify the army, a point gained. (This had been denied by\r\nHenry Malet.) He could not remember about the despatch of the 26th, but\r\nwould look for it.\" (The reason of the great embarrassment of the\r\nGovernment on being questioned about my \"unofficial negotiations\" was\r\nthat they had got into similar difficulties in their Irish policy by\r\nmaking use of Mr. Errington the year before as a means of communicating\r\nunofficially with the Pope about the attitude of the Irish clergy.)\r\n\"Dined with Henry Middleton at his club early, and went with him to a\r\nmeeting of the Anti-Aggression League in Farringdon Street. Sir Wilfrid\r\nLawson, in the chair was excellent. He is the pleasantest speaker I have\r\nlistened to. Also Sir Arthur Hobhouse was good. Frederic Harrison read a\r\nlecture in which he stated the Egyptian case fairly.\" _N. B._--Henry\r\nMiddleton had been much in Egypt and was intimate there with the Coptic\r\ncommunity. A letter written to him during the war by the Coptic\r\nPatriarch has been published. It is interesting as showing how entirely\r\nthe Copts were with Arabi at that time.\r\n\r\n\"_June 27._--Dinner at Pembroke's. All the Wilton Club there, some forty\r\npeople. I sat next to Harry Brand and had a grand row with him about\r\nEgypt. After dinner healths were drunk, my own among the number, and I\r\nhad to make a speech. I felt myself in rather an unfriendly atmosphere\r\npolitically, as most of those present were Jingoes, but I was specially\r\ncomplimented for my public services by Eddy Hamilton, who proposed my\r\nhealth. I said in reply that some served their country in one way and\r\nsome in another, but that as long as one served it and did one's duty,\r\nit did not much matter what one did.\" (These speeches, of course, were\r\nnot serious, as the Wilton Club was only a convivial gathering of Lord\r\nPembroke's personal friends who came together at his house two or three\r\ntimes a year to dine and make merry.)\r\n\r\n\"_June 28._--Rode to George Howard's, and showed him Sabunji's letter\r\nand my Gladstone correspondence. Sabunji states that the National\r\nleaders are thinking of going to England to lay their case before Mr.\r\nGladstone, and I have asked Howard to get me, if he can, an interview\r\nwith Mr. Bright. Bright is more amenable, I fancy to reason than the\r\nrest, and perhaps it might do good to see him. There is no doubt that\r\nwar preparations are being made, for whatever purpose it may be. I don't\r\nbelieve, all the same, that they are intended as anything more than\r\nstrengthening Dufferin's hands at the Conference. I have sent a telegram\r\nto Sabunji saying that nothing is yet decided about sending troops, and\r\nbegging patience.\r\n\r\n\"_June 29._--Called on Bright at his house in Piccadilly. He talked in a\r\nfriendly tone, but less sympathetically than Gladstone and less\r\nintelligently. The upshot, however, is very satisfactory. He assures me\r\nthat no active steps have yet been taken for hostilities, and he does\r\nnot believe they will be taken. He considers the Suez Canal to be of\r\nlittle strategical value to us, preferring, with Gladstone, the Cape\r\nroute for military communication with India. I explained to him my idea\r\nof a Mohammedan reformation and how little the movement in Egypt had in\r\ncommon with the Sultan's fanatical ideas. I think my visit may do good\r\nby strengthening the peace party in the Cabinet.\" (_N. B._--Bright\r\nscouted more strongly than this entry would suggest the idea of\r\nhostilities at Alexandria. He bade me make my mind quite easy about\r\nthem. And I am sure he was speaking truly according to his knowledge.\r\nBut the poor man, whose principles were absolutely opposed to warfare,\r\nwas kept in complete darkness as to what was going on at the Admiralty\r\nand the War Office, and, as he himself afterwards told me, was persuaded\r\nthat, even when the threat of bombardment was decided on in the Cabinet,\r\nit would remain like all the other threats, a _brutum fulmen_. The\r\ntheory laid before the Cabinet by the Foreign Office was that the mass\r\nof the Egyptians were with the Khedive, not with Arabi, and that on the\r\nfirst shot being fired by the British fleet the populace of Alexandria\r\nwould rise and bring Arabi, who was alone in his intention of\r\nresistance, a prisoner to their sovereign's feet. Bright, when he found\r\nhow he had been cajoled into consenting to the bombardment which had led\r\nto the burning of Alexandria and the necessity of a regular war, was\r\nvery angry and resigned his place in the Cabinet, nor did he ever\r\nforgive Gladstone for his share in the deception practised on him or the\r\nabandonment of their common principles.)\r\n\r\n\"Called on Lady Gregory, who has written a paper on the Control of\r\nEgypt, which is amusing. Dinner at the Howards. She (Mrs. H.) is\r\nenthusiastic about my plans.\r\n\r\n\"_June 30._--Colvin contradicts flatly through the 'Times' correspondent\r\nthat either he or Malet have ever made use of my services as mediator or\r\nintermediary on any occasion. This puts him in my hands after Lord\r\nGranville's admission of the fact on Monday.\" (_N. B._--This denial in\r\nplain terms by Colvin of things it is impossible he should have\r\nforgotten need not be characterized by me. The matter was not made\r\nbetter by a private letter he wrote me, 6th July, in which he repudiated\r\nin part his responsibility for the \"Times\" telegram. I accepted his\r\nexplanation at the time as genuine, but when a little later I asked him\r\nto repudiate the telegram publicly, he declined to do so, and in terms\r\nwhich were merely a repetition and aggravation of the untruth.)\r\n\r\n\"Breakfasted with De la Warr to meet Broadley, the 'Times' corespondent\r\nat Tunis.\" (_N. B._--This is the same Broadley whom, at Lord De la\r\nWarr's recommendation I afterwards entrusted with the defence of Arabi.\r\nHe had been practising as lawyer in the Consular Courts at Tunis, and\r\nlatterly as \"Times\" correspondent there. He was a man of great ability\r\nand had made himself serviceable to De la Warr in many ways, giving him\r\nthe information about Eastern affairs which were De la Warr's hobby, and\r\npreparing, when in England, his speeches for him on such subjects in the\r\nHouse of Lords. At the time of the invasion of Tunis by the French he\r\ntook a strong part in the \"Times\" in favour of the Mohammedan rising and\r\npublished a useful book about it afterwards called \"The Last Punic\r\nWar.\") \"He says all are waiting in Tripoli and Tunis for the Sultan to\r\ncome forward. Otherwise el Senoussi will read the Mohammedan revival....\r\nWrote a letter to the 'Times' in answer to Colvin which ought to smash\r\nhim. Luncheon at the Gregorys.\r\n\r\n\"Eddy writes a friendly letter saying that Mr. Gladstone will not go\r\nback from his expressions of sympathy with Egyptian independence, if\r\nwhat I have told him proves true. This must be owing to Bright.\" The\r\nletter here referred to is an important one as bearing on the settlement\r\nafterwards made in Egypt, and the promise of independence and liberal\r\ninstitutions made at Gladstone's suggestion by Lord Dufferin in his\r\ncelebrated despatch. But for the hold I had acquired over Gladstone on\r\nthis point, I have no manner of doubt that after Tel-el-Kebir Egypt\r\nwould have been annexed to the British Empire. The Whigs in the Cabinet\r\nall intended it.\r\n\r\n\"_July 2._--At Brocket. This, after Wilton, is the most charming country\r\nplace I have seen. All in it is exactly as it was fifty and sixty years\r\nago in the days of Caroline Lamb and Lord Melbourne. Lord Palmerston\r\ndied here. Henry Cowper, whose it is now, is to me very sympathetic. Our\r\nparty consists of Henry Brand and his wife, the American Minister, Lord\r\nHoughton, Lymington, and Frederick Leveson Gower, Lord Granville's\r\nbrother and secretary. Great wrangling about Egypt but all friendly\r\nenough, even Leveson. And the American is on my side.... I had a little\r\ntalk with Leveson after we had played lawn tennis. He spoke very\r\ndespondingly of the British Empire, but thought England might last\r\nwithout revolution at home. At Brocket such talk is melancholy.... There\r\nis another fierce attack on me in the 'Observer.'\r\n\r\n\"_July 3._--At Brocket. I fancy if there is to be any intervention at\r\nall it is to be Italian--at least, if intervention is ordered by the\r\nConference. This I should greatly dislike, for at present the Italians\r\nseem sympathetic, but if launched on conquest they would be brutal in\r\ntheir methods. Besides, the Italians are not assailable at home, as we\r\nand the French are.\" (_N. B._--The Italian Government was being asked at\r\nthis date to join us in armed intervention in Egypt, but they wisely\r\ndeclined. It would have been very unpopular with the Liberals in Italy\r\nwhere Menotti Garibaldi was organizing a force to help Arabi.) \"Drove\r\nover to Knebworth to luncheon. Lytton has been building and making a new\r\ndrive into the Park, certainly a great improvement; we talked about the\r\nBritish Empire, on which subject he is as despondent as I am. He thinks\r\nmy policy in Egypt might have succeeded, or any policy but that of\r\ntrusting to chance. Now he foresees a Mohammedan rebellion in India, go\r\nthings how they may.... In the evening to Temple Dinsley where the\r\nBrands are.\r\n\r\n\"_July 4._--To London; found a telegram saying that Arabi certainly\r\nwould not go to Constantinople, also a letter from Sabunji, which has\r\nmade me uneasy. It has evidently been opened in the post, and the\r\ncontents may have compromised the National leaders at Constantinople.\r\nThere are telegrams, too, in the papers about a renewed quarrel as to\r\nthe fortifications at Alexandria; and Lady Gregory, who came to James\r\nStreet, has heard from Sir Erskine May that Beauchamp Seymour has orders\r\nto bombard Alexandria to-morrow.\" (Sir Erskine May, was I believe, the\r\nChief Permanent Official of the Admiralty. The earliest correspondence\r\nreferring to a bombardment in the Blue Books occurs on 26th June, when\r\nthe Admiralty telegraphs to Sir Beauchamp Seymour: \"If Egyptian troops\r\nare making preparations to attack, communicate with French Admiral and\r\nbring ships into position.\" This telegram shows the wolf and the lamb\r\nargument that was being used to excuse our own intended attack. We know\r\nfrom Palmer's journal, to which reference will be made later, that\r\nSeymour had resolved to bombard at least as early as 4th July. Among the\r\ndetermining causes with Gladstone and the Cabinet at this time was, I\r\nbelieve, the bogus report of a massacre at Benha, a wholly fabulous\r\nincident which was largely made use of to infuriate English opinion\r\nagainst Arabi.) \"She [Lady Gregory] has also heard that Colvin has\r\nresigned and his resignation been accepted.\" I don't know whether there\r\nwas any foundation for this report, but it is too late already for his\r\nrecall to have made any difference in the result. It was probably\r\naltogether a false report.\r\n\r\n\"_July 5._--I am very uneasy in my mind now about these threats of\r\nbombardment. At twelve I went to the House of Commons and heard Dilke\r\nannounce that the fleet had orders 'under certain circumstances to act\r\nin a certain way.' Had luncheon with Sir Wilfrid Lawson, who is a really\r\ncharming man, and read him Sabunji's letter describing his dinners and\r\nconversations with the National Chiefs. He and others with him will do\r\nwhat they can. But there is nothing now to do. My letters to Gladstone\r\nare printed, but I dare not publish them until I see what line the\r\nPorte takes.... Dined at Lady Rosamund Christie's. Knowles was there and\r\nsays that the bombardment is to begin to-morrow morning. Fawcett takes\r\nmy side. My fear is lest the Nationalists should stake all on an\r\nartillery duel with the fleet, in which they cannot help being beaten,\r\nand so be discouraged. They ought, I think, to abandon Alexandria, and\r\nmake an entrenched camp out of reach of the guns of the fleet. But I\r\ndare not advise.\" (About this time Button informed me that the Admiralty\r\nplan was to effect a landing during the bombardment with the idea of\r\ncutting off Arabi's retreat. This news, if I remember rightly,\r\ninfluenced my telegram next day and my letter of the seventh.)\r\n\r\n\"_July 6._--Admiral Seymour has sent in an ultimatum, and I have\r\ntelegraphed to Sabunji as follows: 'Avoid meddling with the fleet. Send\r\nAbdu with a message to Gladstone. Patience.' I am not sure whether I am\r\ndoing right, but prudence is certainly on the right side. Besides, Arabi\r\nwill judge independently of my opinion, and he has never yet been wrong.\r\nI have sent copies of my correspondence with Downing Street to Cardinal\r\nManning and Knowles (and also to Lord Dufferin). After luncheon went to\r\nsee Hill, the editor of the 'Daily News.' He is now all on our side, it\r\nbeing too late to do any good. He promises, however, to write what he\r\ncan.... In the evening a telegram from Sabunji saying that all is quiet,\r\nso I suppose the difficulty is staved off.... I wrote to-day to Eddy\r\nproposing to show him Sabunji's letters (those already given). It is a\r\ndesperate remedy, but the circumstances are desperate.\r\n\r\n\"_July 7._--Went to see Stanley of Alderley and urged him to see\r\nMusurus, so as to prevent any split between Arabi and the Sultan. I told\r\nhim pretty nearly the facts of the case, but made him understand this\r\nwas not a moment for Mohammedans to dispute, and that the Turks and\r\nEgyptians could settle their domestic differences later. He seems quite\r\nto agree with me.... Then wrote a letter to Sabunji recommending them\r\nnot to quarrel with the fleet, but to make an entrenched camp out of\r\nreach of the guns. I still think that no English expedition will be\r\nlanded in Egypt, but that they will have to fight the Turks or possibly\r\nthe Italians.... The papers announce a pacific settlement of the\r\ndifference between Arabi and the fleet, which is satisfactory so far.\r\n\r\n\"_July 8._--At Crabbet. The second post has brought a letter from Eddy\r\nHamilton which seems to imply that Gladstone is still open to\r\nconviction. This is more than I expected\"--(and more, too, than the\r\nletter implied. What Hamilton wrote was, \"I hope it goes without saying\r\nthat it has been the desire of the Government all along to get at the\r\ntruth, but that, apparently, has not been so easy.\") \"I have accordingly\r\nbeen preparing a précis of Sabunji's letters. In the Evening Lascelles\r\nand others arrived.\r\n\r\n\"_July 9._--Sunday. I have consulted Lascelles about sending Sabunji's\r\nletters to Gladstone, but he thinks it is too late. Hartington has told\r\nhim that they intend occupying Egypt and probably annexing it, on the\r\nprinciple _j'y suis, j'y reste_. Chamberlain has said: 'We have got the\r\nGrand Old Man into a corner now, and he _must_ fight.' I shall,\r\ntherefore, wait events. The 'Observer' announces a new threat or\r\nUltimatum. This time I shall leave Providence to decide.\" (What I record\r\nhere as having been told me by Lascelles is of historical importance. He\r\nwas in a position to know what was going on more than any of my friends.\r\nAs a former _Chargé d'Affaires_ in Egypt he was consulted at the Foreign\r\nOffice, and as Lord Hartington's first cousin he had his confidences\r\nabout what was going on in the Whig section of the Cabinet.)\r\n\r\n\"_July 10._--A new Ultimatum is announced, this time in terms which\r\nArabi cannot accept. They want him to surrender the forts. The French,\r\nhowever, refuse to take any part in this act of piracy. M. P., who knows\r\nnaval people, assures me that Beauchamp Seymour is in a terrible fright;\r\nthat the 'Invincible' is the only ship with really sound armour plates,\r\nand that the fleet is in a most critical position.\" (There was some\r\ntruth, I believe, in this. The ships, as they were moored in the\r\nharbour, lay directly under the fire of the forts at short range. If the\r\nNationalists had been as unscrupulous as our people were, they might\r\nhave taken the ships at a disadvantage and perhaps sunk them. But Arabi\r\nwas not the man for a _coup_ of this kind, and he was, besides, a\r\nstickler for the common Mohammedan rule of not firing the first shot in\r\nwar. The quarrel, too, was none of his seeking, and all he was bent on\r\nwas to avoid all excuse for a collision. He consequently allowed\r\nSeymour to move his ships away and choose his own distance.) \"Arabi may\r\nthen be in the right in accepting the duel. At any rate, it is forced on\r\nhim in such a way that he cannot refuse. Strangely enough, I am in high\r\nspirits. My idea is that this bombardment and bloodshed, however it\r\nterminates, will produce a revulsion in public feeling here and stop\r\nfurther proceedings. Nobody really wants war or annexation, except the\r\nfinanciers. And these would soon go to the wall if the public spoke. The\r\nPowers, too, will probably be angry at this act of violence in the\r\nmiddle of the Conference. For England the outlook seems very bad. It\r\nwill probably lead to a war with France and the loss of India.... To\r\nLondon and saw Lady Gregory, who wants me to send a copy of my Gladstone\r\nletters to Gibson, as Gibson is the coming man of the Conservatives, and\r\nthe Conservatives will soon be in power. Gladstone was beaten on Friday\r\non an important vote.... Harrison has written Gladstone a scathing\r\nletter, telling him his action in Egypt will ruin his moral character\r\nforever in history. This is certain, and I will take care it does so....\r\nLunched with George Currie, who, as a bondholder, is now pleased at the\r\nfirmness of the Government. They were afraid, he says, at one time that\r\nGladstone would have thrown them over.\r\n\r\n\"To the House of Commons, where I saw Lawson. He asked me what could be\r\ndone. I said, 'Nothing.' Dilke made a statement confirming the\r\nUltimatum.... Lord De la Warr called at six to ask whether I would not\r\ntelegraph to advise an arrangement. But I told him I could not do this\r\nany longer, for the Egyptians could not give up their forts honourably.\r\nHome to Crabbet.\r\n\r\n\"_July 11._--At Crabbet. I settled this morning in my mind that if the\r\nweather was fine things would go well in Egypt--and behold it is\r\nraining!... I shall stay here now till all is over, except on Thursday,\r\nwhen I have been asked to Marlborough House, to have the honour of\r\nmeeting Her Majesty.... We shall know all in a few hours.... It rained\r\nheavily till 2, then cleared. I remained indoors in a nervous state,\r\nunable to do anything.... At half-past four David brought a 'Globe,'\r\nwith news showing that the bombardment began at 7 and was still going on\r\nat half-past 11. At 5, Anne came from London with the 'Pall Mall' and\r\n'St. James's,' showing it was not all over at 1.40. It is evident that\r\nthe Egyptians fought like men, so I fear nothing. They may be driven out\r\nof the forts and out of Alexandria. But Egypt will not be conquered. The\r\nFrench fleet has gone to Port Saïd, and it is impossible there should\r\nnot be an European war. I have sent my Gladstone correspondence to the\r\nPrince of Wales.\r\n\r\n\"_July 12._--The forts are silenced, but the Egyptians show no sign of\r\nyielding, and the newspapers announce another bombardment for to-day.\r\nThis is a monstrous thing. The Sultan, I am glad to see, stands firm;\r\nand a religious war is inevitable, succeeding, as Arabi said it would\r\nthe political one. The prophecy about Gladstone will thus come true. His\r\nconscience must be a curious study just now, the conscience of a Eugene\r\nAram, and I believe him capable of any treachery and any crime. I can do\r\nno more, and shall stay here. Went fishing in the forest, a bright warm\r\nday, with a slight threatening of thunder about noon. The evening papers\r\ntalk of a flag of truce and a heavy swell which has prevented the ships\r\nfrom firing.\r\n\r\n\"_July 13._--Saw Button, who tells me an occupation is inevitable. Old\r\nEdward Blount was in the train. He tells me the French are in no\r\ncondition to fight. Their navy is so ill-found he doubts their having\r\nthe ammunition. He thinks there will be a revolution in a few months....\r\nFound Sir Wilfrid Lawson at home in Grosvenor Crescent and had much\r\ndiscourse with him, but he agrees it is hopeless doing anything with the\r\nGovernment.... Had luncheon with the Howards. She is staunch, he\r\ndoubtful.... Coming back by underground railway I read the news of\r\nAlexandria being in flames, of the evacuation of the town, and of a new\r\nmassacre by roughs. This is nothing but what must have been. I am glad\r\nof one thing only, and that is the army has got safe out of that\r\nmousetrap. I have had it on my mind ever since Arabi went to Alexandria\r\nthat he would be caught there in some way by his enemies. Now he seems\r\nto have done just what I recommended, retired to a fortified position\r\nout of reach of the guns of the fleet. People, or rather the newspapers,\r\nare very angry because he retired under flag of truce, but I am not\r\nmilitary man enough to see where the treachery was, especially as\r\nAdmiral Seymour had announced that he would understand a white flag to\r\nmean the evacuation of the forts.\" (This charge of having violated the\r\nwhite flag was made a special count against Arabi at his trial, and\r\nabsurdly insisted upon by Gladstone, because he, Gladstone, had\r\ncommitted himself to a statement that to retire while under the white\r\nflag was a violation of the laws of war. This was persisted in after\r\nother graver charges were abandoned, until it was discovered that in\r\nLord Wolseley's \"Soldier's Pocket Book,\" a text book in our army, it is\r\ndistinctly laid down that the contrary is the rule.)\r\n\r\n\"I was in two minds about going to Marlborough House, but decided it\r\nwould be best to show loyalty. So went. Everybody cordial enough except\r\nold Houghton, who all but cut me. The Malets were there--poor old\r\npeople--but I did not venture speaking to them. Robert Bourke came to me\r\nin great glee at the mess the Government found themselves in. Such are\r\nthe amenities of party political life. Everybody else nearly was there\r\nthat I had ever seen. The Prince of Wales shook hands with me, but he\r\nsaid nothing. Her Majesty was looking beaming--I suppose elated at her\r\nbombardment. Gladstone is said to have announced in the House that he\r\nwould not send an army to Egypt. He declares he is not at war with\r\nanybody. However Button, with whom I dined, assures me troops are going\r\nand that they mean annexation. Dined with him and Lord Bective.\r\n\r\n\"_July 14._--Breakfasted with De la Warr. I showed him Arabi's letter to\r\nGladstone, and he advised me not to send it, but offered to propose to\r\nthe Prince of Wales to speak to me about it. I think this will be a good\r\nplan. I dare not let the Government have such a document in their hands\r\nuntil it is settled what form intervention is to take.\"\r\n\r\nThe letter here referred to is one that Arabi dictated to Sabunji at\r\nAlexandria and sent to me, desiring me to communicate it to Gladstone as\r\nfrom him. It was not signed or sealed by him, and was sent by Sabunji in\r\nEnglish, not in Arabic; for which reason Arabi afterwards, when charged\r\nwith having written it, among other charges made against him at the time\r\nof his arrest, denied having written at all to Mr. Gladstone. I was\r\nconsequently taunted by my enemies with having forged the letter, though\r\nI had stated that it was \"dictated\" in my enclosing letter of two days\r\nlater. The letter as sent to Mr. Gladstone was as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"Alexandria, _July 2, 1882_.\r\n\r\n     \"SIR,\r\n\r\n     \"Our Prophet in his Koran has commanded us not to seek war nor to\r\n     begin it. He has commanded us also, if war be waged against us, to\r\n     resist and, under penalty of being ourselves as unbelievers, to\r\n     follow those who have assailed us with every weapon and without\r\n     pity. Hence, England may rest assured that the first gun she fires\r\n     on Egypt will absolve the Egyptians from all treaties, contracts,\r\n     and conventions; that the Control and debt will cease; that the\r\n     property of Europeans will be confiscated; that the Canals will be\r\n     destroyed; the communications cut; and that use will be made of the\r\n     religious zeal of Mohammedans to preach a holy war in Syria, in\r\n     Arabia, and in India. Egypt is held by Mohammedans as the key of\r\n     Mecca and Medina, and all are bound by their religious law to\r\n     defend these holy places and the ways leading to them. Sermons on\r\n     this subject have already been preached in the Mosque of Damascus,\r\n     and an agreement has been come to with the religious leaders of\r\n     every land throughout the Mohammedan world. I repeat it again and\r\n     again, that the first blow struck at Egypt by England or her allies\r\n     will cause blood to flow through the breadth of Asia and of Africa,\r\n     the responsibility of which will be on the head of England.\r\n\r\n     \"The English Government has allowed itself to be deceived by its\r\n     agents, who have cost the country its prestige in Egypt. England\r\n     will be still worse advised if she attempts to regain what she has\r\n     lost by the brute force of guns and bayonets.\r\n\r\n     \"On the other hand there are more humane and friendly means to this\r\n     end. Egypt is ready still--nay, desirous to come to terms with\r\n     England, to be fast friends with her, to protect her interests and\r\n     keep her road to India, to be her ally; but she must keep within\r\n     the limits of her jurisdiction. If, however, she prefers to remain\r\n     deceived and to boast and threaten us with fleets and her Indian\r\n     troops, it is hers to make the choice. Only let her not underrate\r\n     the patriotism of the Egyptian people. Her representatives have not\r\n     informed her of the change which has been wrought among us since\r\n     the days of Ismaïl's tyranny. Nations, in our age, make sudden and\r\n     gigantic strides in the path of progress.\r\n\r\n     \"England, in fine, may rest assured that we are determined to\r\n     fight, to die martyrs for our country, as has been enjoined on us\r\n     by our Prophet, or else to conquer and so live independently and\r\n     happy. Happiness in either case is promised to us, and a people\r\n     imbued with this belief, their courage knows no bounds.\r\n\r\n     \"AHMED ARABI.\"\r\n\r\n\"Went to see Gregory. He is frightened at Alexandria's being burnt, and\r\nwill have it that Arabi did not order it. I say he ordered it, and was\r\nright to do so. This is the policy of the Russians at Moscow, and\r\nsquares with all I know of their intentions. I cannot think it will do\r\nany harm in the long run, and it will get more completely rid of the\r\nGreeks and Italians. Of course, he was not responsible for the massacre,\r\nwhich is doubtless exaggerated. To fire the town, cut off the water\r\nsupply and take up a strategical position on the railway is what any\r\ndetermined general would have done.\" (And so I say still. The burning of\r\nAlexandria gave Arabi just the time to entrench himself at Kafr Dawar.\r\nIf he had carried out the other part of his program and blown up and\r\nblocked the Suez Canal, he might have made a good and long fight of it,\r\nand even possibly have won the campaign. I will return to this, however,\r\nwhen I come to treat of the war.)\r\n\r\n\"_July 15._--Button writes that the Prince of Wales wants a copy of\r\nArabi's letter, and I have sent word to say I shall be happy to read it\r\nto His Royal Highness. I will not let it out of my hand as yet.... Sir\r\nDonald Currie came to see the horses. He is sensible about Egypt, as\r\nmany people are individually. But the newspapers are raising a universal\r\nhowl. I am depressed in mind, thinking of the future. Egypt can hardly\r\nnot be ruined, and it is little consolation to think that the Europeans\r\nthere and the bondholders will be ruined too. Still, there is a God in\r\nheaven for those who trust Him.\r\n\r\n\"_July 16._--It seems as if the Turks had at last consented to send\r\ntroops. Button gave me the conditions yesterday. They are to come and go\r\nand catch Arabi, all in a month. The thing is absurd. If they go, they\r\nwill go to stay. They will also make terms with Arabi, and all England\r\nwill have gained will be that the Sultan will declare war. All things\r\nconsidered, this is the best solution I could have expected. Otherwise\r\nit must have been annexation.... Wrote letter enclosing Arabi's letter\r\nfor Gladstone.\r\n\r\n\"_July 17._--Went to London and saw Button. I have agreed to send the\r\nletter to Gladstone and to the Prince of Wales, and have accordingly\r\ndone so.... I wish Gladstone to be warned of all the consequences of his\r\naction in Egypt, as on Saturday he stated that the destruction of\r\nAlexandria was a result which it was impossible to foresee, of\r\nbombarding it! Now, if Cairo is destroyed, he will be without excuse.\r\nBright has resigned. At least _he_ is an honest man. He made his\r\nstatement to-night saying he considers the bombardment a breach of\r\ninternational law and the moral law.\"[20] (I have some reason to believe\r\nthat Gladstone had shared Bright's delusion that the Alexandrian forts\r\ncould be bombarded without serious consequences of bloodshed,\r\nconflagration, and war. The difference between the two men was this:\r\nthat Bright, when he saw he had betrayed his principles by consenting to\r\nit 'went out and wept bitterly'; Gladstone stifled his remorse and\r\nprofited as largely as he could by the popularity which war always\r\nbrings to the Ministry that makes it.) \"... Home late and in low\r\nspirits. I have done what I could to avert this war, and war is now the\r\nonly solution.\"\r\n\r\nHere, unfortunately, my diary of 1882 ends.[21]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[20] I met Bright more than once in later years, and his language was\r\nstrong to me as to the way he had been misled into complicity with the\r\nbombardment of Alexandria. I find the following in my journal of 1885:\r\n\r\n\"_June 9._--To the Howards. She (Mrs. Howard) dined last night with\r\nHartington and Granville and Bright.... Bright told her that he was at\r\nthe Cabinet which decided on the bombardment of Alexandria, but Lord\r\nGranville had assured him it would not really take place, and it had\r\nlong ago been settled that he was to leave the Cabinet on the first shot\r\nfired in any war. It had been a cause of grief and tears to him to watch\r\nthe slaughter which had since occurred, but he had not had the heart to\r\nstand up and denounce his former friends. He had, however, written to\r\nMr. Gladstone after the war to say that if he allowed Arabi to be tried\r\nby the Egyptian Government it would be a _lasting infamy_.\"\r\n\r\n\"_March 16._--At night to dine with the Howards. It was a very\r\ninteresting dinner, John Bright, John Morley, Frederick Leveson, and Mr.\r\nWright, etc.... At first we were all rather stiff.... However, Wright\r\nbroke it up by asking Bright _á propos of boots_, who it was that caused\r\nthe bombardment of Alexandria. Whereupon Bright broke in denouncing the\r\nwar strongly and the injustice of keeping Arabi a prisoner in Ceylon. He\r\nalso explained that Beauchamp Seymour had telegraphed to ask permission\r\nto bombard some time before but had been refused. At last it was\r\nChamberlain who had insisted on his being allowed to do it....\r\nHartington, Bright said, had not urged it.\"\r\n\r\n[21] The allusions to an expected Mohammedan rising in India, here and\r\nelsewhere quoted from my diary, seem now, in the light of events,\r\nsomewhat exaggerated. They were, however, justified by the ideas\r\nprevalent at the time; and the dread of a general conflagration in the\r\nEast is perhaps the best excuse that can be made for our Government's\r\naction in pressing on in July an immediate violent solution of its\r\ndifficulty in Egypt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE CAMPAIGN OF TEL-EL-KEBIR\r\n\r\n\r\nIt now remains for me to give an account of the chief incidents of the\r\nbrief campaign in which for two months native Egypt stood up in arms\r\nagainst her English enemy. No true description of it will be found in\r\nthe works of any English writer, and still less are the French versions\r\nof the story true. The reign of terror, which under the protection of\r\nthe English garrison for a year or more followed the re-establishment of\r\nthe Khedive and the Turco-Circassian _régime_ at Cairo, effectually\r\nstopped the mouths of native Egyptians as to what had happened there\r\nduring the Khedive's absence, and though a momentary light was shed on\r\nthe facts by the publicity of Arabi's trial, no organ of the vernacular\r\npress was found bold enough to allude to them otherwise than according\r\nto the official version; while later, when under French protection the\r\norgans of native opinion had gained courage, time had been given for\r\ncertain legends to grow up which still to a large extent influence the\r\neducated Egyptian mind.\r\n\r\nThe first point to make clear, for it is denaturalized in the Blue Books\r\nand has been ignored by all English writers, is the essentially National\r\ncharacter of the defence offered by native Egypt to the English\r\ninvasion. The official version, of course, is that it was the army alone\r\nthat offered resistance to Seymour's impossible demands at the time of\r\nthe bombardment, and afterwards to Wolseley's land invasion. This was\r\nmerely a continuance of the diplomatic fiction which had been built up\r\nat the Foreign Office to excuse its determination to intervene in\r\nfinancial interests, and may be read in its most grotesque form of\r\nuntruth in Lord Dufferin's opening speech to the European Conference at\r\nConstantinople. According to the English Ambassador, Egypt--and this was\r\nbefore the bombardment--was in a state of anarchy, where neither life\r\nnor property was secure and where massacres were taking place, through\r\nthe action of the army headed by Arabi and other mutinous colonels,\r\nwhich was making it impossible to carry on the government or secure\r\norder and financial stability. How gross an exaggeration this statement\r\nof the political case was, and how it had been gradually put together on\r\na basis of lies and inventions, I have already sufficiently shown. What\r\nneeds still to be explained is the precise share of responsibility for\r\nthe acceptance of Seymour's challenge to the artillery duel at\r\nAlexandria, which commenced the war, assignable to Arabi, on whom the\r\nwhole of it has been unjustly laid.[22]\r\n\r\nThat Arabi had been, from the date of the publication of the Joint Note\r\nof 6th January, a chief advocate of self-reliance and preparedness for\r\nwar is undoubted, but at the same time he had always been for\r\nconciliation, if possible, rather than war. Resistance had always been\r\nhis political platform, but on it he by no means stood alone, and the\r\narrival of the fleets at Alexandria in May had immensely strengthened\r\nhis position with all sections of civilian opinion. With the example of\r\nTunis before Mohammedan eyes it was indeed impossible not to see what\r\nwas being prepared for Egypt by the European Powers, the creation of a\r\nfictitious condition of anarchy and rebellion which should justify\r\nintervention for the protection of the life and property of Europeans,\r\nthe seizure by persuasion or constraint of the person of the ruler on\r\nthe plea that he needed protection from his rebellious subjects, and the\r\nforced acceptance by him of a military protectorate. This had been\r\neffected by the French army in Tunis. It was to be repeated now exactly\r\non the same lines by the English in Egypt. Egyptian patriotism,\r\ntherefore, was not difficult to persuade that at last, with the dire\r\nalternative before them, it was a less ignoble fate to yield after a\r\ndefeat than at once, at the first summons.\r\n\r\nArabi's voice was an important element in the decision arrived at on the\r\n10th of July to reject the admiral's demands, but it had no need of his\r\ninsistence and still less of being imposed by menace. All the members of\r\nthe general Council convened to consider the answer declared themselves\r\nequally of opinion that it was beyond the legal power of the Khedive to\r\nyield any portion of Egyptian territory to the demand of a foreign\r\ncommander without striking a blow or at least without direct orders to\r\nthat effect having been received from the Sultan. Nor was the Khedive\r\nhimself of any other opinion. It included many representative men\r\nbesides the members of the Government--and the spectacle was witnessed\r\nof all alike pressing the view that the forts must be defended, and of\r\nthe Khedive taking a specially prominent part in the patriotic talk and\r\nbeing supported in it by Sultan's representative, Dervish Pasha. No\r\nMoslem present, not even Sultan Pasha, who had definitely thrown in his\r\nlot with the English, dared make the public declaration that another\r\nanswer than refusal was possible to Seymour's demands.\r\n\r\nArabi, as the result of their unanimous decision, received from the\r\nKhedive precise orders as Minister of War and Marine to prepare the\r\nforts for action and to reply with their artillery as soon as the\r\nEnglish fleet should have opened fire, while urgent instructions the\r\nsame evening, of the 10th, were sent to the Under-Secretary of War at\r\nCairo to proclaim throughout the provinces that war had been resolved\r\non, and to hasten the calling in of the reserves and the formation of\r\nnew battalions of recruits. It may be said that the Khedive was\r\ninsincere in the warlike attitude he adopted at the Council. Of course\r\nhe was insincere. No public action of his life showed Tewfik otherwise\r\nthan a double dealer. In all probability both he and Sultan Pasha, who\r\nhad spoken in the same sense, had agreed to make this show of patriotism\r\nso as to cover themselves with public opinion in case it should so\r\nhappen that the forts should prove stronger than the fleets, nor must it\r\nbe forgotten that the Sultan's envoys were present at the Council, and\r\nthe avowed policy of the English Government at the moment was still to\r\nget the Sultan to intervene. Tewfik, therefore, as usual was playing for\r\nthe double chance, and was resolved clearly on one thing only, to side\r\nwith the strongest party.\r\n\r\nThere is a curious despatch in the Blue Books which shows what he said\r\nto his English advisers. As early as the 6th of July he was made\r\nacquainted with Seymour's intention to bombard, and had apparently been\r\nurged to place himself for safety on board one of the English ships. But\r\nthis did not suit his personal fears or the waiting game he was resolved\r\non, and he sent to Colvin to acquaint him with what his plan was in\r\nregard to his safety during the firing. He could not do otherwise--so we\r\nread--than remain in Egypt. He could not desert those who had stood by\r\nhim faithfully in the crisis, or abandon Egypt _when attacked by a\r\nforeign Power_, merely, as it would be said, to secure his personal\r\nsafety. He would, therefore, retire to a palace on the Mahmoudieh Canal\r\nwith Dervish Pasha. And he remarked that the more rapidly the whole\r\naffair was conducted, the less would be the danger to himself\r\npersonally. And this was the program he adhered to, except that he\r\nfinally decided on retiring, not to the Mahmoudieh Palace, but to his\r\ncountry palace at Ramleh, eight miles farther from Alexandria, as a\r\nstill safer place from the chance firing of Seymour's guns.\r\n\r\nShortly after the war I had a curious confirmation of Tewfik's\r\nindecision from no less authoritative a source than Lord Charles\r\nBeresford, who had commanded the Condor at the bombardment and had acted\r\nas Provost-Marshal in Alexandria after it, and who told me that in a\r\nmoment of unusual frankness the Khedive had one day explained to him the\r\nreason of his remaining ashore during the fight, as being nothing else\r\nthan his extreme perplexity as to which of the combatants would prove\r\nthe better fighter. The general belief in Egypt had been that the\r\nEnglish ships would be sunk, and he had been in a state of panic doubt\r\nall day at Ramleh, running every half hour to the roof of the palace to\r\nsee how it fared with them. It was only when he discovered in the\r\nevening that they remained intact, while the forts had been silenced,\r\nthat he finally made up his mind to place himself under Seymour's\r\nprotection. Beresford's experience of the weeks he had then spent at\r\nAlexandria, I may explain, had given him a profound contempt of Tewfik,\r\nand a certain sympathy with Arabi and the fellahin who had carried on\r\nthe war in spite of their prince's defection.\r\n\r\nBe this, however, as it may, the conduct of the Khedive at the Council\r\nand the fact that he had given his name to the orders issued for a war\r\n_à outrance_ imposed a perfectly legal aspect on the subsequent National\r\ndefence, and invalidated, according to all Mohammedan rule and practice,\r\nthe Khedive's counter orders when he had passed over to the enemy's\r\nside. This must be remembered if we are rightly to understand the\r\nNationalists' legal case, and the view taken of the position by plain\r\npatriotic minds when their prince's perfidy gradually became known. The\r\nMohammedan view about war is a simple one. When blows have been struck\r\nand war publicly announced by the Chief of the State, it is his duty and\r\nthe duty of all his people to continue it until some definite victory\r\nhas been achieved or reverse sustained. A prince made captive during the\r\nwar by the enemy is by the fact incapacitated from giving any further\r\nvalid orders, and _à fortiori_ a prince who has turned traitor; and it\r\nwas in this light that Tewfik was considered by his subjects until\r\nbrought back by the force of English arms as their restored, but unloved\r\nlord to Cairo. Nothing of this aspect of the case will, of course, be\r\nfound in any English narrative, but, in place of it, absurd laudations\r\nof a prince to be admired as \"loyal\" for the sole illogical reason that\r\nhe showed himself loyal to England and served her through the war as her\r\nunashamed accomplice. But I will return to these matters later.\r\n\r\nA second point which it is necessary should be insisted on is the proper\r\napportionment of responsibility for the maintenance of law and order\r\nthroughout Egypt, and for the strategical conduct of the war, between\r\nArabi and the other Nationalist leaders who worked with him during\r\nthose eventful two months. The facts as I have been able to ascertain\r\nthem are these. With regard to the government of the country, as soon as\r\nit was clearly demonstrated at Cairo that the Khedive could be no longer\r\nlooked upon as Chief of the State, exercising freely his right of\r\nissuing orders, a General Council was assembled to consider the position\r\nof affairs and decide what should be done. In this the lead was taken by\r\nthe religious and other civilian dignitaries, rather than by the\r\nmilitary element. Arabi was not himself present at the general meeting,\r\nbeing absent with the army at Kafr Dawar, nor did he once during the war\r\npay any visit to Cairo or intervene personally in the management of\r\naffairs there. The Council, however, was very fully attended, there\r\nbeing present, besides the great religious sheykhs, the Turkish Grand\r\nCadi, the Grand Mufti, the Sheykh el Islam, and the heads of the four\r\northodox sects. All the most representative Moslems of the country were\r\nthere, including four princes of the Viceregal House who had openly\r\nespoused the National cause, many of the provincial Governors who had\r\nbeen expressly summoned to Cairo for the occasion, and the chief country\r\nNotables, and also, representing the non-Mussulman population, the\r\nPatriarch of the Copts and the Chief Rabbi. The Council was, therefore,\r\nfully entitled to any claim of validity in its decisions which\r\nuniversality can give, for it comprised all sections of political\r\nopinion and class divergency. Many of the chief men were of Circassian\r\norigin, but endowed with sufficient patriotism as Moslems to see that,\r\nnow it had come to fighting against a European invader, no honest choice\r\nwas left but to defend Egypt against him irrespective of party feuds.\r\n\r\nIt was, accordingly, resolved by the Council, without a dissentient\r\nvoice, that the Khedive was no longer in a position legally to command,\r\nand that his decrees, while he remained in English hands, were from that\r\nvery fact invalid. Tewfik's first announcement of his new attitude had\r\nbeen to dismiss Arabi from his post of Minister of War. The Council\r\nresolved that Arabi should be maintained in it, and instructed him as\r\nsuch to continue the defence of the country. A permanent Council, or\r\nrather it should perhaps be called \"Committee of Defence,\" was named to\r\nassist him in his work, and this under the able presidency of Yakub\r\nPasha Sami, the Under-Secretary for War, continued throughout the\r\ncampaign to organize the details of recruitment, provisioning and the\r\nsupply of military material. Similarly, with regard to the civil\r\nadministration of the country it was resolved that in the absence of\r\nRagheb and the other Ministers at Alexandria--for these had been\r\ndetained more or less under compulsion by the Khedive and his English\r\nguard--the business of government should be carried on by the separate\r\ndepartments without any change in the ordinary routine, nor did this\r\nlead to the smallest confusion, seeing that the Ragheb Ministry had\r\nnever been a working one. Indeed, the Administration gained considerable\r\nin efficiency, and it may safely be said that no Egyptian Government was\r\never better managed in its details than was the National one during the\r\ncampaign. The Ministry of the Interior fell to the charge of the\r\nUnder-Secretary, Ibrahim Bey Fawsi, and the police, in its most\r\nimportant section, to Ismaïl Eff. Jawdat, both very able administrators,\r\nwho, in spite of the excitement of the time, succeeded in maintaining\r\nperfect order throughout the country. Two or three Circassian Mudirs,\r\nwho had sought to ingratiate themselves with Tewfik by imitating Omar\r\nLutfi and inciting to disturbance, were by them arrested and detained in\r\nprison to the end of the war, and after this no further rioting\r\noccurred. Such Europeans as remained at Cairo were carefully protected,\r\nand all who wished to leave were forwarded under police escort to Port\r\nSaïd.\r\n\r\nNothing could have been more untrue than Lord Dufferin's repeated\r\nassertions at the Conference at Constantinople that massacres of\r\nChristians were occurring daily in Egypt. And so, too, with the other\r\ndepartments. There was no interruption in the regular gathering in of\r\nthe taxes, or in the regular distribution of civil expenditure. At the\r\nend of the war the Treasury showed a perfectly clean balance, without\r\nthe smallest deficit, when its coffers were delivered over to the\r\nKhedive's officers after Tel-el-Kebir. No smallest sum had been\r\nextracted and the books were in their usual order. The ordinary course\r\nof justice had been regularly maintained, and there was no visible sign\r\nof the country having passed through any unusual crisis. Four months'\r\nprovision for the army remained in the magazines of the War Office when\r\nWolseley took possession of them.\r\n\r\nAs to Arabi, his position continued to be essentially a political one,\r\nand it was as Minister of War that he worked with the supreme direction\r\nof the forces and as popular leader till Wolseley's advance on\r\nTel-el-Kebir hurried him suddenly from the scene. His great prestige\r\nwith the country sheykhs and the fellahin of the Delta made it easy for\r\nhim to inspire these with enthusiasm for the war, and at his pleading\r\nsupplies flowed in gratuitously from all sides, and also volunteers for\r\nthe army. In this respect he proved himself of great service to the\r\nnational defence, and he was probably well advised in making no attempt\r\nfrom first to last to take any personal part in handling troops in the\r\nfield. His abstention on this head has been attributed by his detractors\r\nto physical cowardice, and it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that\r\nthere was some truth in this. Arabi was too pure and unadulterated a\r\nfellah to have any of the strong fighting instincts which are found in\r\nsome races but are conspicuously absent in his own. His courage was of\r\nanother kind than that which prompts to daring action in war, and in\r\nspite of his soldier's training he had never been present at any actual\r\nbattle. He was probably conscious of his deficiency on this head as he\r\ncertainly was of his complete lack of all the higher scientific\r\nknowledge which modern warfare requires. He was absolutely without\r\nmilitary education of a modern type, or experience beyond that of the\r\ncommon barrack-yard routine, and he would, I imagine, have been quite\r\nunable to manoeuvre a division had he been called upon to do so even\r\non parade. The true explanation, however, of his personal inaction, I\r\nthink, is that Arabi, being for the moment practically Head of the\r\nState, was not expected to lead the army in person. This does not,\r\nhowever, excuse him altogether in my eyes, nor has it excused him in\r\nthose of his fellow countrymen who rightly blame him for not having\r\npersonally crossed swords with the enemy, at least in the last days of\r\nthe campaign.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the actual military operations I do not profess to have\r\nfull knowledge, but nevertheless will venture a short account of them as\r\nI have been able to obtain them from Egyptian, and not English, sources.\r\nMy admirable correspondent, Sabunji, had unfortunately left Egypt with\r\nthe other fugitives just before the bombardment, and I remained without\r\nknowledge of what was passing in the country till the end of the war.\r\nNor do the documents of the trial throw much light on this. What I have\r\nbeen able to learn has been gathered piecemeal in after years from those\r\nwho took part in them, and accounts of this kind are never very accurate\r\nas to dates or figures. The only European present with the army was that\r\nexcellent Swiss patriot and friend to Egyptian freedom, John Ninet, who\r\nwas in a position to know much of what went on, as he spent the first\r\nmonth of the war with Arabi at Kafr Dawar, helping him with his foreign\r\ncorrespondence; and with Ninet I have had many talks. But his\r\nenthusiastic character injures him as a quiet safe historical witness,\r\nand the book he published in 1884 is so carelessly written and so\r\ncontroversial in its style that it is impossible for one to have full\r\nconfidence in regard to the details he records. Moreover, Ninet had\r\nceased to be at headquarters before the real campaign began, having\r\nremained on at Kafr Dawar when these were transferred to Tel-el-Kebir.\r\nSuch knowledge as I have of the war I will nevertheless briefly give.\r\n\r\nOn the day of the bombardment the Egyptian artillerymen fought well, and\r\nfor a far greater number of hours than either Sir Beauchamp Seymour or\r\nany of his officers had thought possible. They were, however, at a\r\nterrible disadvantage through the antiquated character of the forts they\r\nwere called upon to defend. These dated from the reign of Mohammed Ali\r\nand were faced as the fashion had then been with stone, a most dangerous\r\nmaterial for their defenders when exposed to modern shell fire, as the\r\nstone work splinters and so increases the explosive effect of the\r\nhostile missiles. The defect had not been foreseen even by so able an\r\nengineer as was Mahmud Fehmi, and the loss among the defenders was\r\ngreat. The total Egyptian garrison of Alexandria is given in the Blue\r\nBooks as from 8,500 to 9,500 men, and this figure corresponds fairly\r\nwell with native accounts, while a thousand has been named as the number\r\nof the killed and wounded. If the figures are anything near correctness\r\nthe proportion is a very large one. The honour of the garrison was in\r\nany case amply saved, and was the beginning of a reaction of opinion\r\nagainst the war in England which in the following weeks became more and\r\nmore pronounced. Arabi's part in the defence was as on subsequent\r\noccasions not a prominent one. He remained during the day at the\r\nMinistry of Marine which is not far from Ras-el-Tin and so within the\r\nrange of the enemy's fire, but he made no personal inspection of the\r\ndefences until the bombardment was over, and contented himself with\r\nbeing at hand to receive the news of the fight and give the necessary\r\norders. In the evening he went to Ramleh to announce the result to the\r\nKhedive, where Tewfik, to hide his satisfaction, made a fool's quarrel\r\nwith him because he had not brought with him a detailed report of the\r\nday's fight _in writing_.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to understand that Arabi should not have seen which way\r\nthe Khedive's mind was already set. In all probability he did so, and\r\nthe danger there was of treachery, for in the morning he sent a strong\r\nguard nominally for the Khedive's protection, but really to keep him\r\nunder surveillance, with a message informing him that as Seymour\r\nthreatened a renewal of the bombardment he should have to withdraw the\r\ngarrison, and inviting him to retire with them beyond range of the\r\nEnglish guns and so to Cairo. Arabi without doubt ought to have gone\r\nhimself a second time to see that the invitation was not on any pretext\r\nevaded and have carried Tewfik, if necessary, by force as a prisoner\r\naway with him, for the example of the Bey of Tunis was before him, and\r\nhe had sufficient experience of the Khedive's craft to make it\r\nimpossible to trust anything to his honour. Arabi's negligence in this\r\nmatter was a fatal error. Arabi was, however, apparently too occupied\r\nthat morning in arranging the military evacuation to give the time\r\nnecessary for another visit to Ramleh, and in the course of the\r\nafternoon, by dint, according to Tewfik's account to his English\r\nfriends, of _bakshish_ and a liberal distribution of orders, he managed\r\nto slip away from his guards to Alexandria in the train sent to convey\r\nhim to Cairo, and there placed himself, without any more disguise, under\r\nSeymour's protection. He carried away with him, too, as all were in the\r\nsame train, both Dervish and his Ministers, and so secured them as in\r\nsome measure partners of his treachery. Once at Ras-el-Tin with a guard\r\nof seventy English bluejackets the whole party were practically\r\nprisoners. Dervish, five days later, having a swift steam yacht of his\r\nown, and having received peremptory orders from Constantinople, put an\r\nend to the disgrace for himself of the situation, and managed to evade\r\nthe English fleet which tried to stop him. But Ragheb and his fellow\r\nMinisters, hopelessly compromised, ended by accepting the situation and\r\nremained on at Ras-el-Tin as Tewfik's servants till such time as having\r\nserved their purpose as a simulacre of legal government, they had to\r\nmake room for a stronger and more decidedly English administration.\r\nArabi, in the meanwhile, ignorant how he had been befooled, was wholly\r\nengrossed in the business of withdrawing the troops from their position\r\nof danger, and taking up a new and better line of defence at Kafr Dawar.\r\n\r\nThe choice of this very strong post upon the Cairo railway, lying as it\r\ndoes flanked by the shallow lake of Mariut and a series of marshes, was\r\ndue, I believe, to Mahmud Fehmi's engineering skill, and Arabi could not\r\nhave done better than he did by adopting it as the site of his new camp.\r\nIt lay well beyond the reach of Seymour's guns, and could not be\r\napproached by a hostile army, except along the narrow causeway of the\r\nrailway line, and so was practically impregnable from the side of\r\nAlexandria, while on the land side all the Delta lay open to the troops,\r\nwith its inexhaustible supplies and free communication with Cairo. Here\r\nthe Egyptian army was able to hold its own against the English\r\nsuccessfully for nearly five weeks, repulsing all attacks, and even\r\nharassing the enemy with counter attacks almost to the gates of\r\nAlexandria. Had there been no other gate of entry into Egypt than Kafr\r\nDawar the National game would have been won.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the burning of Alexandria I have never been able to make\r\nup my mind exactly what part, if any, the Egyptian army took in it.\r\nArabi has always persistently denied having ordered it, and an act of\r\nsuch great energy stands so completely at variance with the rest of his\r\nall too supine conduct of the war that I think it may be fairly\r\ndismissed as improbable. At the same time it is equally clear that he\r\ncould not but regard it as a fortunate circumstance, for without it it\r\nis very doubtful whether he could have made good his retreat to Kafr\r\nDawar. His army was a beaten army, and though not exactly demoralized\r\nmight easily have become so, had even a very small force been landed\r\nfrom the fleet to hold the railway line and bar their retreat. It\r\ncertainly was in the English plan to entrap the army if possible, and\r\nonly the unexpected valour of the defence, and perhaps the _ruse_ of the\r\nwhite flag seems to have prevented some attempt at a landing with this\r\npurpose from being made by Seymour. As it was, the burning of Alexandria\r\nmade it possible for Arabi to establish himself quietly at Kafr Dawar\r\nand gain those few days' breathing time needed by his army to recover\r\ncompletely its _morale_.\r\n\r\nNinet, who was present at the whole affair, attributes the conflagration\r\nprimarily to Seymour's shells, and this is probably a correct account,\r\nfor without it it would be difficult to account for the panic which on\r\nthe 12th of July, made the whole population of Alexandria abandon their\r\nhomes and fly from the city. Had the artillery attack been restricted,\r\nas was pretended, to the forts this hardly would have been the case, and\r\nit is quite certain that it was not so restricted. Whether by intention\r\nor by mistake the city received its share of the shell fire, and Ninet\r\nspeaks as an eyewitness in regard to its destructive effect. At the same\r\ntime it is equally certain that the conflagration was increased, and\r\nespecially in the European quarter, with purpose and intention, and that\r\nthis was the work to some extent of the rearguard of the army, which\r\nleft Alexandria in a state of disorder and shared in the plunder,\r\nalready begun by the Bedouins of the city. Nor is it less certain that\r\nSuliman Pasha Sami, who commanded the rearguard, was called to account\r\nin no way by Arabi for what his men had done. I do not consider the\r\nquestion of any great importance as affecting the moral aspect of the\r\ncase, it being clearly a military measure which any commander would be\r\njustified in adopting, thus to cover his retreat and make useless,\r\nas far as in him lay, the enemy's base of operations on shore.\r\nHistorically, however, it is of importance, and I therefore say that on\r\na balance of evidence I am of opinion that the retreating army had its\r\nshare in it, not in consequence of any order, but as an act of disorder.\r\nAs there was a strong wind blowing at the time, the conflagration soon\r\nspread, and by midnight the whole city was in a blaze. The fact,\r\nhowever, in no way lessens the prime responsibility of our Government\r\nfor the destruction, every detail of which, but for the gross\r\nmiscalculation of our agents, might have been easily foreseen and ought\r\ncertainly to have been provided for.\r\n\r\nOnce established at Kafr Dawar, which was occupied on the 13th, the\r\nEgyptian army was in clover and could wait events. Arabi established his\r\nheadquarters at Genjis Osman, one station farther on in the direction\r\nof Cairo, and Mahmud Fehmi laid out the lines of defence, and all worked\r\nheartily and confidence was restored. The mass of the Alexandrian\r\nfugitives were gradually despatched by train to the interior, where for\r\nawhile they gave great trouble, being in a state of fanatical anger and\r\ndespair, and ready to revenge their troubles on any European or native\r\nChristian who might cross their path. At Tantah especially, where the\r\nCircassian Mudir, Ibrahim Adhem, was an adherent of the Khedive, and who\r\nknew that disturbances between Mohammedans and Christians had been\r\nlooked on favourably by the Court, something which was almost a massacre\r\noccurred, and but for the timely intervention of the great local magnate\r\nand friend of Arabi's, Ahmed Bey Minshawi, who put it down in spite of\r\nthe Governor with a band of his fellah adherents, the disorder might\r\nhave spread to other places. But the Mudir was summarily arrested\r\nand sent a prisoner to Cairo, as were two other Mudirs equally\r\nuntrustworthy, and the trouble ended, nor was internal peace again\r\ndisturbed during the whole of the war.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 14th, a first communication reached Arabi from the\r\nKhedive, the text of which is given by Ninet, but which will not be\r\nfound in the Blue Books. It is a valuable document, dictated evidently\r\nby Colvin or some other of Tewfik's English advisers, as it is based in\r\nevery phrase on the English official view of the situation. It begins by\r\nstating the cause of the quarrel, that the bombardment was the simple\r\nconsequence of a refusal to comply with the English admiral's demand for\r\nthe dismantling of the forts, and that he, the admiral, had no intention\r\nof imposing a state of war on Egypt, that he now wished to renew\r\nfriendly relations with the country, and was ready to hand back the city\r\nto any Egyptian army which should be disciplined and obedient, and in\r\ndefault of such to Ottoman troops. In order to make the necessary\r\narrangements for their transfer, the Khedive invites his Minister of War\r\nto return at once to Ras-el-Tin, there to confer with Ragheb Pasha and\r\nthe rest of his colleagues, and in the meanwhile to suspend all warlike\r\npreparations, now become useless. We know from the Blue Books that this\r\nfriendly invitation to Arabi was merely a trap to lure him back into\r\nEnglish reach, and so secure his person, for on the 15th Cartwright\r\ntelegraphs to Granville, \"The Khedive has summoned him [Arabi] here. If\r\nhe comes he will be arrested, if not, declared an outlaw.\" The incident\r\nshows how entirely Tewfik had already made himself the unresisting\r\nmouthpiece of English policy, and how entirely the English Government\r\nhad adopted as its own the treacherous methods of the Ottoman Government\r\nin dealing with \"rebels.\" Arabi's answer was to remind the Khedive that\r\nit was His Highness himself and Dervish Pasha who had urged that the\r\nadmiral's demands should be rejected and that his menaces, if followed\r\nby acts, should be answered with war; that as a matter of fact a state\r\nof war existed, and that until the British fleet should have left\r\nAlexandria it was impossible that the army could return to the city. The\r\nrefusal was followed a few days later by the receipt, at Kafr Dawar, of\r\na number of printed proclamations bearing the Khedive's signature, in\r\nwhich it was announced to the various Mudirs, Notables, and others whom\r\nit might concern, that Arabi, having refused to obey the Khedive's order\r\nto go to Alexandria and confer with him, he was deprived of his\r\nfunctions as Minister of War. It was the publication of these three\r\ndocuments at Cairo, whither Arabi forwarded them, that led to the\r\nsummoning of the Great National Council already described, with the\r\nresult we have seen.\r\n\r\nThe month that followed was one full of hope and enthusiasm for the\r\nEgyptians. Relieved by his strange defection to the enemy from all doubt\r\nas to their allegiance to the Khedive, the citizens and country Notables\r\nwere able to display their patriotism without disguise, and the whole\r\ncountry was aware that it was a war now in which, as Moslems, they were\r\nconcerned no less than a war for liberty. With the mass of the fellahin\r\nso deeply in debt, it was understood besides as a war against their\r\nGreek creditors, and there is no doubt that this was the chief motive\r\npower that sent volunteers to the standard, and that unloosed the purse\r\nstrings of the Notables. A very few days proved that in establishing the\r\narmy at Kafr Dawar a wise choice had been made, for the English, under\r\nGeneral Alison who had landed with several thousand men, though often\r\nattacking it, were always repulsed, and it was fondly hoped that the\r\nresistance might thus be indefinitely prolonged.\r\n\r\nAt Genjis Osman, Arabi, now the chief personage in the state, though\r\nstill holding rank only as War Minister, held daily a kind of court, to\r\nwhich the provincial magnates, the Cairo Ulema, and the great merchants\r\nthronged. A huge tent, formerly belonging to the Viceroy Saïd, received\r\nthem, Saïd's widow having presented it to her husband's once A. D. C. as\r\na national offering, while Nazli Hanum and others of the princely ladies\r\nshowed also their enthusiasm by gifts to the hero of the day.[23] It\r\ncannot be denied that Arabi's head was somewhat turned by these\r\nflatteries, and that they were the occasion of military jealousies which\r\nproved detrimental to the cause when soon after the pinch came. If Arabi\r\nshould succeed in repelling the English attack to the point of their\r\nhaving to come to terms with him, it was felt that he would remain\r\nmaster of Egypt; and officers far better educated than himself, and with\r\na better knowledge of the art of war, and who knew Arabi for what he\r\nwas--a very poor soldier--felt aggrieved at the thought of his future\r\nfortunes and his present pre-eminence. Arabi himself was doubtless quite\r\nunaware of this, and in his dreamy way followed where fortune led him,\r\nand with an ever-growing superstitious belief in his high destiny and\r\nhis providential mission as saviour of his people. His religious tastes\r\nled him to surround himself especially with holy men, and much of the\r\ntime which he should have given to the secular duty of organizing the\r\ndefence was wasted with them in chaunts and recitations. This seems to\r\nhave been continued by him to the very end. What his ultimate military\r\nplan was it is difficult to determine. According to Ninet his\r\ncalculation was that if he could prolong the resistance for a few\r\nmonths, Europe would be obliged to come to terms with him. The\r\nConference was sitting at Constantinople, and the Sultan was being\r\nurged on all sides to intervene, and the worst that could happen was\r\nthat Ottoman troops would be landed, who were as likely as not to\r\nfraternize with his own. He knew himself to be regarded throughout the\r\nMohammedan world as the champion of Islam, for the pilgrims just\r\nreturning from Mecca had brought the news, and it would be difficult for\r\nthe Sultan to take real part with England against him. He had, too, a\r\nremnant of his trust in Gladstone, and of the traditional belief in\r\nEnglishmen's sympathy with liberty, which he believed might still\r\nprevail if only the truth could be brought home to them by the spectacle\r\nof Egyptian patriotism--dreams, of course, and most delusive ones, but\r\nshared in by many others, and not altogether inexcusable, considering\r\nthe events of the past six months.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, on the 16th August, Wolseley, with the first instalments\r\nof the British land expedition, disembarked at Alexandria, and, as it\r\nwas not to be supposed that he would confine himself to the thankless\r\ntask of bombarding the impregnable lines of Kafr Dawar, it became urgent\r\nwith the military committee sitting at Cairo to decide on providing new\r\nlines of defence on the far more easily assailable side of the Suez\r\nCanal. An Eastern army under Ali Fehmi was consequently got together at\r\nCairo, which occupied the Canal in force; and the lines of Tel-el-Kebir,\r\nwhich, in spite of the warning I had sent through Sheykh Mohammed Abdu\r\nin April, had never been more than traced, began to be dug in earnest.\r\nIt became also a question of imminent importance to block the Suez Canal\r\ntowards its northern extremity, lest British ships should be beforehand\r\nwith the defence and should land at Ismaïlia. The opinion was unanimous\r\namong the military chiefs that this was a strategic necessity, and that\r\nat any cost of quarrel with the French Canal authorities it should be\r\ndone. Arabi, however--and this was his second great mistake--could not\r\nmake up his mind to the act. His hesitation was due to French influence.\r\nM. de Lesseps had arrived at Alexandria towards the end of July and,\r\nhaving learned something of the English design of using the Canal for an\r\nattack on Egypt, became alarmed for its safety, and he had gone on to\r\nPort Saïd and set himself to work to prevent, as far as in him lay, this\r\ndesign by appealing to Arabi's sense of honour. De Lesseps was a man of\r\ngreat self-confidence, and believed himself able, by the mere fact of\r\nhis presence, to intimidate our Government, and represented that the\r\nCanal was neutral ground and excluded from the operations of\r\nbelligerents. After the war, when I was carrying on the defence of\r\nArabi, I wrote to M. de Lesseps to obtain from him what evidence he\r\nmight be able to give in the prisoner's favour as a humanitarian and\r\nfriend of progress, and he placed in my possession copies of the letters\r\nhe had received from Arabi in relation to this matter, though not of\r\nthose he had himself written.[24] From this it is clear how Arabi was\r\nmisled.\r\n\r\nAfter some preliminary correspondence, we find Arabi on the 4th of\r\nAugust giving his decision plainly. Several English men-of-war, under\r\nthe command of Admiral Hewett, were in the Canal between Ismaïlia and\r\nSuez, and Lesseps had written to complain that they were giving orders\r\nand issuing proclamations to the inhabitants on shore. Their right to do\r\nthis Arabi repudiates, saying, that it is by direction of the Council\r\nthat he sends him the answer, and adds, apparently in reply to some\r\nfurther appeal made to him personally by Lesseps, to respect the Canal's\r\nneutrality: \"As I scrupulously respect the neutrality of the Canal,\r\nespecially in consideration of its being so remarkable a work, and one\r\nin connection with which your Excellency's name will live in history, I\r\nhave the honour to inform you that the Egyptian Government will not\r\nviolate that neutrality, except at the last extremity, and only in the\r\ncase of the English having committed some act of hostility at Ismaïlia,\r\nPort Saïd, or some other point of the Canal.\" Here the principle is\r\nclearly and well laid down, but the weak point of it is to be perceived\r\nin its leaving to the enemy to commit the first act of hostility instead\r\nof forestalling and preventing him.\r\n\r\nNevertheless we have Ninet's assurance, which has been confirmed to me\r\nfrom other quarters, that every preparation was made secretly for the\r\nblocking of the Canal at a certain point between Ismaïlia and Port Saïd,\r\nand that it was only due to Arabi's extreme personal unwillingness to\r\nsign the final order that, in opposition to the opinion of all his\r\ncolleagues in the Council, the hour of grace was allowed to slip by.\r\nLesseps, on the arrival of the British fleet at Port Saïd conveying\r\nWolseley and the army, had sent Arabi a last bombastical telegram,\r\nwhich Ninet quotes as follows: \"Ne faites aucune tentative pour\r\nintercepter mon Canal. Je suis là. Ne craignez rien de ce côté. Il ne se\r\ndébarquera pas un seul soldat anglais sans être accompagné d'un soldat\r\nfrançais. Je réponds de tout.\" This occasioned a final council of war at\r\nKafr Dawar on the 20th at which all but Arabi were resolved to disregard\r\nLesseps' message. Arabi, however, suffered himself to be deceived still\r\nby the boast about the French troops, and argued against it, and though\r\norders were given that evening for the \"temporary\" destruction of the\r\nCanal, the delay caused by the discussion had already been fatal, and\r\nWolseley had steamed through the Canal before they had been executed.\r\nArabi's weakness in this matter is a most serious blot on his strategic\r\nfame, and stamps him also with political inefficiency. Wolseley\r\nalluding, long after, to it in a speech made by him in connection with\r\nthe proposed Channel Tunnel between England and France, said: \"If Arabi\r\nhad blocked the Canal, as he intended to do, we should be still at the\r\npresent moment on the high seas blockading Egypt. Twenty-four hours\r\ndelay saved us.\"\r\n\r\nThe date of Wolseley's occupation of Ismaïlia was the 21st of August,\r\nand from this point the defence of Egypt entered into a new and\r\npractically hopeless phase, though the campaign was not so wholly a walk\r\nover for the English as has been pretended. The British army was over\r\n30,000 strong, and though probably of no great fighting value had it\r\nbeen opposed to European troops, was sufficient to deal with the scanty\r\nforces at Arabi's command. The whole strength at Kafr Dawar had never\r\nbeen more than 8,000 regulars, with 80 Krupp guns, nor in all Egypt\r\ncould it be counted at more than 13,000 disciplined men, while the new\r\nlevies got together within a month were unfit as yet for any service\r\nexcept that of manual labour at the trenches. Wolseley, therefore, had a\r\ncomparatively easy job before him when once he found himself ashore with\r\nno obstacle between him and Cairo, except the unfinished lines of\r\nTel-el-Kebir. The English intelligence department had, however, to make\r\nassurance doubly sure, already taken secret measures for success of a\r\nkind which is always employed in modern warfare but never avowed, and\r\nwhich it is right that I should here put on record, having by a curious\r\naccident the details of the most important of them in my possession.\r\nThat Wolseley's advance was helped by bribery has always been\r\nindignantly denied by English writers, but it is time the truth should\r\nbe authoritatively told.\r\n\r\nThe attack on Egypt from the side of the Suez Canal had been resolved on\r\nby our War Office and Admiralty early in the year, and it was determined\r\nabout the middle of June to prepare the way betimes by a large operation\r\nof bribery, especially among the Eastern Bedouins. The credit of the\r\nparticular _modus operandi_ belongs personally to Lord Northbrook, who,\r\nas I heard at the time of its first supposed success from Gregory, took\r\na special pride in it, and the more so because it was based upon a hint\r\nI had originally thrown out, with no thought when I did so that it might\r\nbe ever seriously acted upon or used against any who were to be my\r\nfriends. It will be remembered that in the spring of 1881 I had\r\ntravelled through the desert east of the Canal, and had interested\r\nmyself in certain unfortunate Sheykhs of the Teyyaha and Terrabin tribes\r\nheld in captivity at Jerusalem, and that in order to persuade our\r\nEmbassy at Constantinople to solicit their release I had represented\r\nthat it might one day be found of importance to have these Bedouins\r\nfriendly to England. Lord Northbrook had heard of this, and, now that I\r\nwas in such disfavour with the Government, thought it would be amusing\r\nto \"hoist me with my own petard,\" and by using my name in addition to\r\nmore solid inducements to get the help of these Arabs against Arabi.\r\n\r\nAt that time hardly any Englishman could speak a word of Arabic, and it\r\nwas difficult to discover an emissary capable and willing to undertake\r\nthe job. Northbrook consequently called into his counsels the then\r\nprofessor of Oriental languages at Cambridge, Edward Palmer, a\r\ndistinguished Arabic scholar, who also had some personal acquaintance\r\nwith the district intended to be operated in, as he had been connected\r\nat one time with the Palestine Exploration Society. Palmer was then\r\nliving in London, an impecunious man, making a poor living by\r\njournalism, and weighted in his struggle for life by a recent marriage.\r\nWhen, therefore, on the 24th of June he received an invitation, through\r\nCaptain Gill, R. E., of the Intelligence Department, to breakfast the\r\nnext morning with Lord Northbrook at the Admiralty, and was met there\r\nwith an offer from Lord Northbrook that he should undertake the task,\r\nrepresented to him as an honourable and patriotic one, of ascertaining\r\nthe bribable character of the Bedouins east of the Canal, and securing\r\ntheir services for the British Army, and with it the further offer of\r\n£500 down for preliminary expenses, and promises of large pecuniary\r\nreward in case of success, poor Palmer did not hesitate and agreed to\r\nstart at once. Just before his departure, however, on the 26th, he\r\ncalled on me, representing himself to be on his way to Alexandria, where\r\nhe had been appointed correspondent of the \"Standard\" newspaper, and\r\nasking introductions to my Nationalist friends there for whom he felt,\r\nhe said, a strong sympathy and would favour in his writings. This, of\r\ncourse, was a cover to his real business, as to which he was silent, and\r\ninclined me to granting his request, and, though I did not trust his\r\ncountenance, which was far from sincere, I gave him introductions to\r\nSabunji and one or two others, though not, I think, to Arabi.\r\n\r\nPalmer's true programme traced out for him at the Admiralty was to go\r\nfirst to Alexandria, where he was to discuss his plans with Admiral\r\nSeymour, and then without delay to proceed to Jaffa where he should\r\nassume an Eastern disguise and visit the desert south and west of Gaza,\r\nand put himself into communication with precisely those Teyyaha and\r\nTerrabin tribes whose interests I had espoused eighteen months before.\r\nHis journals, portions of which have been published, are on this point\r\nvery instructive. In them the details of his arrangement with Lord\r\nNorthbrook are constantly alluded to. He describes going on board\r\nAdmiral Seymour's yacht at Alexandria, where he was told to proceed at\r\nonce to the desert and begin work, the Admiral giving him \"a revolver, a\r\nrifle, and plenty of cartridges,\" and where he finds it \"expected there\r\nwill be war at once, and perhaps it may begin tomorrow.\" \"I am glad,\" he\r\nsays, \"there is really to be fighting, because, though I shall be a long\r\nway off, I shall be able to get a great deal of good out of it and do\r\nsomething towards winning it for our side....\" The Admiral said to me he\r\n\"congratulated the country on finding so able a man to undertake such a\r\ndifficult task.\" Palmer also sees \"Sir Sidney Auckland [_sic_] the\r\npolitical agent\"; and we learn later in the journal that the Admiral\r\ntold him Alexandria was to be bombarded soon. Then he goes, much elated,\r\nin the Admiral's steam launch, on board the steamer for Jaffa, with the\r\nBritish flag flying, and \"two sailors to carry the gun and revolver.\"\r\n\r\nAt Jaffa he lodges with the British Consul, the Jew Shapira, who sends\r\nhis son down to Gaza to help his preparations for the desert journey and\r\nfind an Arab to go with him, and he buys himself Arab dress and other\r\nthings he may require. He laments the heat and the difficulty of his\r\nmission, but consoles himself with dreams of rich rewards and possible\r\nhonours. On the 15th, just before leaving for the desert, he hears\r\nsecretly of the bombardment, and decides to go through to Suez where he\r\nwrites for a ship's boat to take him off at a safe place.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th he sees a number of the Terrabin tribe: \"They were very\r\ncurious to know who I was and what I wanted. My man said I was a Syrian\r\nofficer on the way to Egypt. Of course I am dressed in full costume like\r\na Mohammedan Arab of the towns. I found out more about them than they\r\ndid about me. I now know where to find and get at every Sheykh in the\r\ndesert, and I have already got the Teyyaha, the most warlike and\r\nstrongest of them all, ready to do anything for me. When I come back I\r\nshall be able to raise 40,000 men. It was very lucky that I knew such an\r\ninfluential tribe.... I get on capitally with my mission, and am longing\r\nto get instructions from Suez and know if our troops have landed. I did\r\nnot expect to find out as much as I have done this first trip. I think\r\nour fortune will be made.\" On the 18th \"I had an exciting time, having\r\nmet the great Sheykh of the Arabs hereabouts. I, however, quite got him\r\nto accept my views.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again, 19th July, \"It is wonderful how I get on with them. I have\r\ngot hold of some of the very men Arabi Pasha has been trying in vain to\r\nget over to his side, and when they are wanted I can have every Bedawi\r\nat my call from Suez to Gaza.... Of course I know nothing of what has\r\nbeen done in Egypt since I left, except that Alexandria was bombarded as\r\nthe Admiral told me it would be soon. But I hear from the Arabs that the\r\nEgyptian military party are still in arms, so I suppose our troops must\r\nhave landed by now.\" On the 20th \"The Sheykh, who is the brother of\r\nSuliman, is the one who engages all the Arabs not to attack the caravan\r\nof pilgrims which goes to Mecca every year from Egypt, so that he is the\r\n_very man_ I wanted. He has sworn by the most solemn Arab oath that, if\r\nI want him to, he will guarantee the safety of the Canal even against\r\nArabi Pasha, and he says that if I can get three Sheykhs out of prison,\r\nwhich I hope to do through Constantinople and our Ambassador, all the\r\nArabs will rise and join me like one man.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 21st, \"I am anxious to get to Suez, because I have done all I\r\nwanted by way of preliminaries, and as soon as I can get precise\r\ninstructions I can settle with the Arabs in a fortnight or three weeks\r\nand get the whole thing over. As it is, the Bedouins will keep quite\r\nquiet and will not join Arabi, but will wait for me to give them the\r\nword what they are to do. They look upon Abdallah Effendi, which is what\r\nthey call me, as a very grand personage indeed!\" On the 22nd, \"I hear\r\nfrom a Bedouin, who has just come on from Egypt, that Arabi Pasha has\r\ngot 2,000 horsemen from the Nile Bedouins and brought them to the Canal.\r\nBut when they get to Suez they will soon go back, for my men know them,\r\nand if fair means won't do I shall send 10,000 of the Teyyaha and\r\nTerrabin fighting men to drive them back. I have got the man who\r\nsupplies the pilgrims with camels on my side, too, and as I have\r\npromised my big Sheykh £500 for himself, he will do anything for me. I\r\nam very glad that the war has actually come to a crisis because now I\r\nshall really have to do my big task, and _I am certain of success_. I\r\nshall know almost directly what I am to get. Lord Northbrook told me I\r\nwas to have the £500 for this first trip, and that as soon as I began\r\nnegotiations with the Arabs they would enter on a fresh arrangement with\r\nme. I shall save at least £280 out of this, which is not a bad month's\r\nwork!... I don't think they can give me less than £2,000 or £3,000 for\r\nthe whole job....\" And again on the 26th, \"I find it is possible to get\r\nto the ships near Suez, and I start to-morrow, and hope to be on board\r\nin four or five days. I have been so successful that I shall write for\r\nmore money, saying I have been obliged to spend all mine on presents--a\r\nfew hundred pounds is a great deal to us and nothing to the Government,\r\nwho would, I know, have given thousands for what I have already done--of\r\ncourse I shall make the most of the difficulties and they have been\r\nreally great. I will send you a hundred or so as soon as I get the\r\nchance from Suez.... I have had to give away a great deal, but have\r\nstill nearly £300 left after paying my journey to Suez! That is better\r\nthan newspaper work, £300 in a month!\" \"I have had a great ceremony\r\nto-day, eating bread and salt with the Sheykhs in token of protecting\r\neach other to the death!\" On the 28th, \"I have got the great Sheykh of\r\nthe Haiwath Arabs with me now, and get on capitally with him. In fact I\r\nhave been most wonderfully successful throughout. I have been sitting\r\nout in the moonlight repeating Arabic poetry to the old man till I have\r\nquite won his heart.\"\r\n\r\nAt last Palmer reaches Suez, August 1. \"I am safe on board the P. and O.\r\nboat,\" he writes, \"and have got your letter. I got here by going to a\r\npart of the coast above Suez, and got on board at midnight. It cost me a\r\nlot of money, nearly £10, but I escaped the Egyptian sentries. The\r\ntroops are coming on Thursday, and this is Tuesday!... I have just seen\r\nthe Admiral. He is delighted with the result of my work and has\r\ntelegraphed to Lord Northbrook. He had three boat crews watching the\r\ncoast for me, but I got here by myself.\" August 2, \"I am off again to\r\nthe desert for a short trip in about two days. I have been asked to go\r\nto the coast and cut the telegraph wires and burn the poles on the\r\ndesert line so as to cut off Arabi's communications with Turkey! Captain\r\nGill arrived at Port Said yesterday and will be here this morning.\r\nYesterday I had a most interesting day. I called on the captains of all\r\nthe men-of-war and met with a most pleasant reception. They all insisted\r\nupon my drinking iced champagne with them, and in the evening the\r\nAdmiral gave a dinner party on board the flagship in my honour. It was a\r\nbeautiful dinner and I did not get back to my ship until one this\r\nmorning.\" August 4, \"On Monday I was ordered to accompany the commanding\r\nofficer and take Suez. We landed with three guns and 500 men. The\r\nEgyptian soldiers ran away, so we had no fighting to do. I was in the\r\nfirst boat which landed. We then made the Governor give us up the town\r\nand £50,000 which he had, and we took possession. The day before\r\nyesterday Lord Northbrook telegraphed to the Admiral to congratulate me\r\non my safe arrival, and informing me that I was appointed 'Interpreter\r\nin Chief to Her Majesty's Forces in Egypt,' and placed on the Admiral's\r\nStaff. I am here [Suez] in great state at the hotel at Government\r\nexpense, and have all my meals with the Admiral. I am going up to\r\nIsmaïlia the day after to-morrow on a gunboat, and the Admiral here\r\nsaid, 'Don't let the other Admiral keep you--you are on the books of the\r\n\"Euryalus,\" his flagship.' I have got a staff of about forty men working\r\nunder me. The Admiral told me the other night that I was sure of the\r\nEgyptian medal and the 'Star of India.' They won't let me go to the\r\ndesert, for the present at least, as they want me here.... I am one of\r\nthe Chief Officers of the Expedition and an awful swell. The 72nd\r\nregiment are coming to-morrow and I have got to see about camels for\r\nthem.... The pay is to be what I suggest, but I haven't settled it yet.\"\r\nAnd then suddenly the splendid climax, \"Captain Gill has just come, and\r\nplaced twenty thousand pounds at my disposal for the Arabs.\"\r\n\r\nThe rest is a mere dream of gold and glory. August 6, \"Suez ... I start\r\nto-morrow for a few days in the desert to buy camels. Captain Gill and\r\nthe Admiral's Flag Lieutenant go with me, and we shall be all safe and\r\njolly. My position seems like a dream. The Admiral said as I preferred\r\nleaving the Government to settle my pay, that in the meantime I might\r\ndraw _to any amount_ for private expenses--so I will send you another\r\n£500 as soon as I come back. I could do it now, but do not want to look\r\nhard up. I have got £260 left, after paying all expenses of my journey,\r\netc., in hard money in my despatch box, and to-day _twenty thousand\r\npounds in gold were brought by ship and paid into my account here!_ I\r\nhave _carte blanche_ to do everything. I give passes to the sentries. If\r\nI see a dozen horses I buy them off-hand. Yesterday I found thirty\r\ncamels and gave a man £360 for them by just writing on a slip of paper.\r\nTo-night I have been interpreting while the Governor dined with the\r\nAdmiral. I have servants, clerks, and interpreters at my beck and call,\r\nand in short I could not be in a higher position. We are very securely\r\nentrenched here and the enemy is eighty miles off, and to-morrow the\r\nIndian troops are coming. Of course it is war time, but as I am on the\r\nstaff of the Commander-in-Chief, I am not likely to get into risky\r\nplaces. I have seen active service though, having been one of the first\r\nto land when Suez was taken. The Admiral is such a nice man, and I am\r\ntold he never forgets his officers, but pushes them on to promotion. He\r\n_told me_ I should get the 'Star of India'! good-bye.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the last pathetic entry in a very human document. The next day\r\nPalmer started with Gill and Charrington for Nakhl in the eastern\r\ndesert, Gill's mission and Charrington's being to destroy the telegraph\r\nwire between Egypt and Syria, for which purpose they took with them a\r\nbox of dynamite, while Palmer's mission was announced as that of \"buying\r\ncamels.\" The two officers, like Palmer, were dressed in Arab costume,\r\nbut they had with them uniforms to add dignity to their proceedings when\r\nthey should reach the friendly tribes. The amount of money taken with\r\nthem out of Palmer's £20,000 has been variously stated at £3,000 to\r\n£8,000. Gill has recorded his dissatisfaction at the nature of the\r\nmission on which he was called to serve. It cannot have been the\r\npurchase of camels, an official euphemism which now that Palmer had\r\nbecome a high officer of Her Majesty he seems to have adopted, but\r\nbeyond a doubt to carry out his original avowed purpose and fulfil his\r\npromises to his Bedouin friends, by paying them the large sums agreed\r\non. He would have taken all the £20,000 for his 40,000 fighters but that\r\nthe Admiral expostulated.\r\n\r\nThe party, however, was foredoomed to disaster. The Bedouin escort, men\r\nof the Haiwat and Howeytat, got scent of the gold they were carrying,\r\nand were determined to be beforehand with the Teyyaha, for whom it was\r\nintended--the Egyptian governor of Nakhl, an isolated fort halfway\r\nbetween Suez and Akabah, there is good reason to believe, being their\r\naccomplice and instigator. They had hardly therefore, got more than a\r\nfew miles on their way before they were attacked, made prisoners,\r\ndespoiled, stripped and bound, and finally shot at the edge of a ravine\r\nin the Wady Sudr. And so poor Palmer's dreams of fortune ended. The\r\ncatastrophe was too conspicuous a one to save the Government from\r\nquestions asked in Parliament, and that worthy gentleman, Sir Henry\r\nCampbell-Bannerman, as Under-Secretary, was put up in the House of\r\nCommons to give answer and to deny roundly the whole affair of Palmer's\r\nsecret mission, or of any dealings on his part with the Bedouins, except\r\nas buyer of camels.\r\n\r\nNor does Professor Palmer's journal stand alone as documentary\r\nevidence. Captain Gill also left a diary amply confirming the main\r\nfacts. His business under the Intelligence Department was of the same\r\nnature west of the Suez Canal as Palmer's had been east of it. The diary\r\nbegins at Alexandria and the writer speaks of having gone to see Sir\r\nFrederick Goldsmid, the head of his department, and he expresses his\r\nhope to be soon at work among the Bedouins west of the Canal. He\r\ndescribes having received, in the Khedive's own handwriting, a list of\r\nthe principal Sheykhs between the Canal and the cultivation, of whom he\r\nmentions two by name, Saoud el Tihawi at Salahieh, and Mohammed el\r\nBaghli at Wady Tumeylat. He understood the Bedouins to be waiting to\r\nside with whomever they found it their best interest to follow. At Port\r\nSaïd Gill hears from the ex-Governor that these Bedouins can be bought\r\nat from £2 to £3 per man. On 4th August he mentions reading Palmer's\r\nreport to Sir B. Seymour. He says, \"Had I known the report would go\r\ndirect to the Admiral, I would have asked Hoskyns whether he had the\r\nmoney for Palmer.\" He adds, \"Palmer says he can buy fifty thousand\r\nBedouins for £25,000, and I shall certainly urge that the money be given\r\nhim.\" He mentions a report of his own as to blocking the Canal, which he\r\nsays could only be effectively done by the Egyptians at one point, which\r\nhe names, and gives as his reason the want of stones elsewhere to sink\r\nthe barges with. He talks of Lesseps as having it in his power to do\r\nreal mischief, as he has all the dredges and boats belong to the Canal\r\nat his disposal. August 5th: Gill goes down the Canal with another\r\nofficer to Suez, taking with them £20,000 in gold for Palmer. They stop\r\nat Ismaïlia, and he sees there Mr. Pickard, with whom he discusses the\r\nbest route to choose for cutting the telegraph. He says there are three\r\nways: (1) from the coast near el Arish, which both agree would be\r\ndangerous, (2) from Gisr or Kantara, objectionable as violating the\r\nneutrality of the Canal, and (3) from Suez, the only practicable route.\r\nHe does not seem to trust Pickard, and decides to cut the wire himself\r\nfrom Suez. August 6th: He mentions the fact that he is glad to get rid\r\nof the £20,000 on its being made over to Palmer. He talks of going with\r\nPalmer to a great meeting of Shekyhs he is to attend at Nakhul, and\r\nremarks that if he goes so far with him he shall be able to judge how\r\nfar \"Palmer's rather rose-coloured expectations\" are justified. These\r\ntwo documents between them amply prove the reality of the bribery\r\nresorted to before Tel-el-Kebir.\r\n\r\nI was much connected with this affair at the time it occurred, as I was\r\napplied to by members of the families of all the three victims of it, to\r\naid in their researches, and to make the matter public and in one\r\ninstance to obtain from the Government a proper recognition of services\r\nrendered and as yet unacknowledged. The case, after being denied in the\r\nHouse of Commons, was at my instance brought on by my brother-in-law,\r\nLord Wentworth, in the House of Lords, and was the occasion of much\r\nanger among the Ministerial peers, and an astonishing display of\r\nuntruth. Lord Granville, Lord Northbrook, and their colleagues, got up\r\none after the other and roundly denied the whole story of Palmer's\r\nmission, and of his having received any money for the purpose of bribery\r\namong the Arabs. It is a curious fact that Lord Salisbury, to whom I\r\nwent just before the debate to try to enlist his aid in opposition to\r\nthe Government, excused them in some measure to me on the ground that in\r\ncases where secret service money was concerned, it was conventionally\r\npermitted to Ministers to lie. He nevertheless aided Lord Wentworth to\r\nthe extent of securing him a fair hearing, which the others would have\r\nprevented.\r\n\r\nPalmer's and Gill's were nevertheless but crude dealings, and would by\r\nthemselves, I think, have done little to further Wolseley's objects but\r\nfor the far more efficacious intervention in support of them given by\r\nthe Khedive. Saoud el Tihawi was the only Arab Sheykh who systematically\r\nor at all efficiently betrayed Arabi, and it was the Khedive who\r\nprocured his defection. Saoud received in payment for his work as spy in\r\nArabi's camp 5,000 Austrian crowns, and betrayed him throughout, from\r\nthe date of the removal of the Egyptian headquarters from Kafr Dawar to\r\nTel-el-Kebir. Saoud was an Arab of a naturally superior type, and with a\r\ngood head on his shoulders, but he had long been perverted by his\r\nassociation with Lesseps and the French, having his land and permanent\r\ncamp within a day's journey only of the Suez Canal, and had been\r\naccustomed to hunt the gazelle with them, and play the part of fine\r\ngentleman, which is the ruin of Bedouin morality. That he did indeed\r\nplay the part of spy and traitor in the English interest I have his own\r\nhalf admission, for passing by Salahieh in the spring of 1887, I stopped\r\na night at his tents, and he seeing me to be English, and knowing\r\nnothing of my political sympathies, spoke of his doings during the war\r\nin terms there was no mistaking. Acting as scout for Arabi, it was easy\r\nfor his men to pass from camp to camp, and so convey intelligence. There\r\nwas nothing specially to be ashamed of in this treachery, according to\r\nBedouin morals, for to the Arab tribes Egyptians and Turks and Franks\r\nare equally outside the sphere of their allegiance, and in serving them\r\nit is merely a question of what suits their interest best. On the east\r\nof the Nile the Bedouins have exceedingly little religious feeling to\r\nprevent their siding with the infidel, if their advantage lies that way,\r\nand no love was ever yet lost between Bedouin and Fellah.\r\n\r\nWhat did Arabi infinitely more harm than this and facilitated the\r\nrapidity of Wolseley's advance, was the tampering with his officers\r\nthrough the instrumentality of certain emissaries despatched in disguise\r\nto Cairo and Tel-el-Kebir, who, armed with money and promises of\r\npromotion and advancement when the \"rebellion\" should have been put\r\ndown, succeeded in detaching not a few from their loyalty. This was not\r\ndone directly by Wolseley or the English intelligence Department,\r\nthough, perhaps the funds were furnished by them, but by the Khedive,\r\nwho was far better aware whom to approach with success than any\r\nEnglishman could be. His most intelligent and active agent in this work\r\nwas his A. D. C., Osman Bey Rifaat, who knew well the temper of most of\r\nthe officers, and the jealousies which inspired them. To these,\r\nespecially to those of Circassian origin, he represented the futility of\r\nthe National resistance and the advantage there would be for them in\r\nbeing beforehand in reconciling themselves to the Khedive instead of\r\nawaiting the punishment which would certainly follow. Wolseley and the\r\nEnglish were only acting as the Khedive's servants and in concert with\r\nthe Sultan, who also was about to send troops, having declared Arabi a\r\nrebel. With the Circassians this line of argument naturally had weight,\r\nand with the baser class of Egyptian officers the money argument was\r\nadded. Arabi, for the reasons already stated, although enthusiastically\r\nfollowed by the rank and file of the army, had incurred no little\r\njealousy among the superior officers, who judged themselves to be all\r\nbetter soldiers than he, and his procrastination in the matter of\r\nblocking the Canal had still further increased their dissatisfaction.\r\nAll confidence in his military leadership was destroyed among them from\r\nthe day of the landing of the English at Ismaïlia without the promised\r\nopposition of the French, and without adequate preparations to oppose\r\nthem on that side having been made.\r\n\r\nWith the civilian chiefs of the Nationalists another agent was employed,\r\nalso not without effect. This was none other than the old leader of the\r\nfellah movement, Sultan Pasha, who, having thrown his lot in now wholly\r\nwith the English, was not ashamed to lend himself to the work of\r\nspreading disunion among those who still retained their patriotism. To\r\nthe new generation of the Egyptians it seems difficult to understand how\r\na man of such initial high conduct as a lover of his country should have\r\nsunk to so mean a pass. But I think it is not really difficult to\r\nexplain. Sultan was a proud man of great wealth and importance, and used\r\nto being given the first place everywhere--the \"king,\" as he was\r\ncalled, of Upper Egypt, the first and foremost of the great fellah\r\nproprietors--and with what seemed to him a natural right to leadership\r\nin the fellah party. Arabi he had patronized as a younger man and one of\r\nno social standing, who might help him in his ambitions, but who should\r\nnever have presumed to supplant him in the popular affections. He was\r\ndisappointed on the formation of the Sherif Ministry in September, 1881,\r\nthat he was given no place in it, and was only half consoled with the\r\npresidency assigned him of the new Parliament. Still less was he pleased\r\nwhen on the formation of the more purely fellah administration of\r\nFebruary, 1882, he was again left out, and the lack of what he\r\nconsidered the due consideration shown him caused him to drift gradually\r\ninto opposition. Then came the arrival of the fleets at Alexandria, and,\r\nas we know, he was partly cajoled, partly frightened by Malet into\r\ndeclaring himself in favour of the English demands, and threw in his lot\r\nfinally with the Court party against his former associates. There is\r\nnothing difficult to understand, more than in the Khedive's case, in the\r\ndownward grade he was obliged to follow. It became with him, I imagine,\r\na matter of obstinacy rather than any longer of ambition, and his\r\npatriotic scruples had been allayed by the promise made him that the\r\nEnglish intervention was intended only to restore the condition of\r\nthings previous to the Mahmud Sami Ministry, and that Egypt should still\r\nhave her claim to Constitutional government respected. In this sense he\r\naddressed letters to his numerous former friends at Cairo, putting\r\nforward the explanation that the alliance between the Khedive and the\r\nEnglish was a merely temporary necessity, as the English troops would\r\nnot stay in Egypt when once the Khedive's authority had been\r\nre-established; and that Arabi had lost the confidence of the Sultan,\r\nand that the continued resistance at Cairo was generally condemned by\r\nMoslems. These letters, distributed carefully, were not without their\r\ninfluence, and money again played its powerful part. Sultan indeed seems\r\nto have advanced the money out of his own pocket, for the very first\r\nfinancial act of the restored Khedivial Government after Tel-el-Kebir\r\nwas to make him a public present of £10,000 under the title of an\r\nindemnity for losses sustained by him during the war, while he also\r\nreceived an order of English knighthood. The sums actually given away by\r\nSultan were not, as far as I can learn, very large, being supplemented\r\nwith more considerable promises, which after the war remained\r\nunfulfilled, and very likely the £10,000 more than covered the sums\r\nSultan actually disbursed. Be this as it may, there is no question that\r\nwith the Khedive's help Wolseley's path of victory was made a very easy\r\none.[25]\r\n\r\nIn spite, however, of all these disadvantages of internal intrigue, the\r\nNational defence might still have been prolonged, if the end could not\r\nbe averted, but for the bad luck which from this point throughout\r\nattended the army. As soon as it was quite clear that Egypt would be\r\nattacked from the East, Mahmud Fehmi, the engineer, the ablest of all\r\nArabi's lieutenants, was despatched to Tel-el-Kebir, to carry out and\r\nfinish the lines there, which had never been more than lightly traced.\r\nHad they been finished as they ought to have been, they should have\r\nproved a formidable obstacle to the advance of the English army, but by\r\nan extraordinary fatality, which was hardly within the range of the\r\ncommon hazards of war, the General, within a few days of his arrival,\r\nwas captured and made prisoner by a small party of English Life Guards,\r\nwho, far in advance of the English position, happened to be passing\r\nnear. The accident was a strange one. Mahmud Fehmi, attended only by an\r\nA. D. C., and having put off his uniform on account of the heat, had\r\npassed one evening to the other side of the Wady Tumeylat, and partly to\r\nget a breath of air, partly, too, for a better view of the desert in the\r\ndirection of Ismaïlia, had climbed alone, on foot, a low sandhill, of\r\nwhich there are several, running into the cultivated land, when suddenly\r\nthe small English party pounced on him. As Mahmud was not in uniform,\r\nColonel Talbot, in command of the party, was doubtful how to treat him,\r\nand was near accepting his explanation that he was an Effendi with\r\nproperty in the neighbourhood, but finally decided to carry him off with\r\nthem, which they accordingly did, the A. D. C., having remained in a\r\nvillage hard by not knowing what had happened, nor had Talbot any notion\r\nof the value of his capture until some time after the return of the\r\nparty to the English headquarters. As a matter of fact, however, it was\r\none of the greatest possible importance, and a blow to the defence of\r\nTel-el-Kebir for which there was no remedy.[26]\r\n\r\nThe second misfortune was the disabling at Kassassin of the two\r\ngenerals, first and second in command, at a critical moment of that not\r\naltogether unequal combat. These were Ali Fehmi, Arabi's tried\r\ncompanion, and Rashid Pasha, two officers who were both good soldiers,\r\nwith courage and some experience of war, and who took the initiative\r\nagainst Wolseley first by a reconnaissance, and then by a renewed attack\r\non him in force at Kassassin. It was the best and last chance the\r\nEgyptians had of checking the English advance, and it was not very far\r\nfrom being successful. According to the Egyptian account of the affair,\r\nthe enemy was taken by surprise, and for a long time the issue remained\r\ndoubtful, the Duke of Connaught being at one moment near being made\r\nprisoner. Had this happened and had the Egyptians maintained their\r\nadvantage, there is no knowing what terms might not have been granted\r\nthem of recognition and peace, for already public opinion had veered\r\nround in England, and people were becoming ashamed of a war waged\r\nagainst peasants fighting for their freedom from an ancient tyranny. Two\r\nthings, however, failed them in their plans, first Mahmud Sami was to\r\nhave advanced from Salahieh with a couple of thousand men to join them\r\nin the morning and take the enemy on his right flank, but misled by\r\nSaoud's Bedouins in the night he missed the point of rendezvous; and\r\nsecondly, it is certain that Arabi, if he had had any soldierly\r\ninstincts, ought to have taken the field in person with them, if not in\r\nthe front line of attack, at least as commanding a strong reserve. As it\r\nwas, the whole force employable did not appear on the battlefield, and\r\nby a still further stroke of ill fortune both the commanders were\r\nwounded, and put for the rest of the campaign _hors de combat_. It is\r\nalso certain that one of the Egyptian generals, Ali Bey Yusuf, purposely\r\nbetrayed his comrades.\r\n\r\nFrom this point all was confusion at Tel-el-Kebir, and the pitiful end\r\nbecame certain. Arabi had lost his best generals and knew not where to\r\nreplace them. There were not many he could trust, and those men only of\r\nquite inferior ability. One man indeed there was who might still have\r\ngiven consistency to the defence, but for some inexplicable reason he\r\nwas left away from the field of action. This was the third of the\r\noriginal \"three colonels,\" Abd-el-Aal Helmi, a valiant fighting man as\r\nany in the army. For some time past he had been employed in what was at\r\none moment the important duty of defending Damietta from a possible\r\nBritish landing, and he had with him some of the very best troops,\r\nnotably the Soudanese regiment which had been Abd-el-Aal's own. Had\r\nthese, with their commander, been brought at once to Tel-el-Kebir, they\r\nmight have saved at least the honour of the army, for Abd-el-Aal was one\r\nwho could be relied upon for forward action, and his troops were full of\r\nspirit and undiscouraged by defeat. It seems, however, still to have\r\nbeen thought that Damietta needed its garrison, for I cannot find that\r\nthe Military Committee so much as suggested Abd-el-Aal as Ali Fehmi's\r\nsuccessor. I have sometimes thought that Yakub Pasha Sami, the President\r\nof the Military Committee at Cairo, good service as he had done in\r\norganizing the war, had at this time been tampered with by the Khedive's\r\nagents. He was a Mussulman, of Greek origin, and so one of the ruling\r\nclass, and there are documents in my possession which show him, though\r\nArabi's right-hand man at the War Office, as always a Khedive's man\r\nrather than a Nationalist. The Khedive seems to have counted him as\r\nsuch, and as in other instances after the war, treated him for that\r\nreason with exceptional rigour, and he was one of the seven Pashas\r\nexiled to Ceylon, though the attitude he adopted before the Judges had\r\nbeen one of servile repentance and protestations of loyalty. Of his deep\r\njealousy of Arabi the papers give ample evidence, and it is quite\r\npossible that after the disabling of Ali Fehmi, he did his best to\r\nisolate Arabi and hasten his ruin at Tel-el-Kebir. Instead of Abd-el-Aal\r\nthe command was given to a very worthy but quite incompetent man, Ali\r\nPasha Roubi, one of Arabi's old companions of the early days of the\r\nNational movement, but who had no other qualification for so responsible\r\na post.\r\n\r\nArabi himself meanwhile, in spite of the imminence of the English\r\nattack, remained stolidly on in camp surrounded, as always, by the\r\ncountry Notables, who still flocked to see him, and by religious men,\r\nwith whom he passed the time in prayers and recitations. He relied\r\nimplicitly on Saoud el Tihawi to give him news of any further advance by\r\nWolseley, and Saoud always lured him into security. The army at\r\nTel-el-Kebir was the most incoherent one imaginable. Of regular,\r\nwell-disciplined troops, infantry of the line, there cannot have been\r\nmore than 6,000 to 7,000, with, perhaps, 2,000 cavalry and a\r\ncorresponding number of guns served by good artillerymen. This was all\r\nthe really reliable force. The rest were a half-clothed and wholly\r\nundisciplined rabble of recruits and volunteers, good, honest fellahin,\r\nhardworking as labourers in the trenches, but of no fighting value\r\nwhatever. Their total number may have been 20,000, but I have no\r\naccurate statistics to go by. Day and night they worked valiantly to\r\ncomplete the unfinished lines, but this was all the military service\r\nthey possibly could render. Stone Pasha, the American, after the war\r\nstated it freely as his opinion that not one of the whole number had\r\neven as yet fired a ball cartridge, and this was probably true.\r\n\r\nThe end came suddenly at dawn on the morning of the 13th of September.\r\nThere has been much romance written by English military writers of the\r\nsilent and hazardous night march from Mehsameh under guidance of the\r\nstars and of a young naval officer, and doubtless to those who took part\r\nin it it seemed that the English army was groping its way blindly to the\r\nunknown, but in reality the road had been made plain for them by the\r\nsecret means I have alluded to. Two of Arabi's minor officers, both\r\nholding responsible positions, had accepted, a few days before, the\r\nbribes offered them by the Khedivial agents. The names of these two\r\ndeserve, to their eternal shame, to be put on record. The first was\r\nAbd-el-Rahman Bey Hassan, commander of the advanced guard of cavalry,\r\nwho was placed with his regiment outside the lines in a position\r\ncommanding the desert road from the east, but who on the night in\r\nquestion shifted his men some considerable distance to the left, so as\r\nto leave the English advance unobstructed. The second was the already\r\nmentioned Ali Bey Yusuf, in command of a portion of the central lines\r\nwhere the trenches were so little formidable that they could be\r\nsurmounted by any active artillery. By the account generally given, and\r\nArabi's own, he not only left the point that night unguarded, but put\r\nout a lantern for the guidance of the assailants. Other names have been\r\nmentioned to me, but not with the authority of these two, and I\r\ntherefore prefer not to put them down. As to the two I have given, their\r\nposition as traitors was notorious for years at Cairo, as little secret\r\nwas made of it by them, especially by Ali Bey Yusuf, who complained\r\nfreely of the scurvy treatment he had received for his services. £1,000\r\nindeed had been paid him down in gold before the battle, but a further\r\npromise of £10,000 had never been kept to him, nor did he succeed in\r\nobtaining more from the Government, when he had spent his first round\r\nsum, than a poor pension of £12 a month, which was paid him to his\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nArabi and the rest of the army, deluded by Saoud into a false security\r\nas to that night at least, slept profoundly, the poor men in their\r\ntrenches and Arabi at his headquarters, about a mile to the rear. Thus,\r\nwithout any warning, they suddenly found the enemy upon them, the lines\r\ncrossed at their weak point by the English, and a little later artillery\r\nin their rear. The vast number of the recruits fled without firing a\r\nshot, half-naked as they were sleeping, worn out with their constant\r\nlabour of entrenchment, and having thrown their arms away across the\r\nopen plain, and were cut down in hundreds as they ran. It was a mere\r\nbutchery of peasants, too ignorant of the ways of war even to know the\r\ncommon formulas of surrender. This was in the centre and to the right of\r\nthe position. To the left a more gallant stand was made, especially\r\nwhere Mohammed Obeyd was in command, and here and there all along the\r\nlines by the Egyptian artillery. The whole thing lasted hardly more than\r\nforty minutes. Mohammed Obeyd fell gallantly fighting, and with him the\r\nflower of the regular army, and many gunners too who had stuck\r\nobstinately to their guns. But at the end of an hour the fighting was\r\nwholly over, and what remained of the National army was a mere broken\r\nrabble.\r\n\r\nAs to the part played personally by Arabi that fatal morning, I have the\r\nevidence, besides his own, of a very worthy man, Mohammed Sid Ahmed, his\r\nbody-servant, who in 1888 entered my service as manager at Sheykh Obeyd\r\nand remained two years with me. From him I have over and over again\r\nheard the events narrated. According to Sid Ahmed, the whole camp that\r\nnight was in profound slumber, having been assured by the scouts that\r\nthe English were making no movement, his master's headquarters at about\r\nthe centre of the whole camp, but more than a mile in rear of the front\r\nline of trenches, as undisturbed as the rest. The Pasha had undressed\r\nand gone to bed as usual and slept soundly through the night, nor was\r\nany one awake before the sound of the guns announced the attack. Arabi\r\nthen threw hastily on his uniform and got on horseback and rode towards\r\nthe firing, followed, among others, by his servant, also mounted. They\r\nhad not, however, got far when they were met by a crowd of fugitives,\r\nwho declared that all was lost, while Saoud's Bedouins also were\r\ngalloping wildly about, adding to the general confusion. The Pasha, Sid\r\nAhmed assured me, did his best to rally the men, and continued to\r\nadvance towards that part of the lines where Mohammed Obeyd was still\r\nholding out, but was gradually borne away with the rest, and yielded to\r\nhis (Sid Ahmed's) prayers that he would seek his safety in flight. The\r\nidea that his master had any duty of dying on the field of battle was\r\nalways wholly absent from Sid Ahmed's mind, and he prided himself on\r\nhaving succeeded in persuading him. They were both well mounted on\r\nhorses, which had been sent to Arabi by one of the Bedouins of the\r\nWestern Fayoum, and reached the Tel-el-Kebir station just before it was\r\noccupied by the English, and though unable there to take train, got\r\nacross the small canal bridge before it closed, and so by the causeway\r\nto the other side of Wady Tumeylat, whence they galloped their best for\r\nBelbeis. They were alone, Arabi having been separated from his staff in\r\nthe confusion. Arabi's one idea now was to get to Cairo before the news\r\nof the disaster should arrive and prepare the city for defence. At\r\nBelbeis they took train and reached the capital not long after noon.[27]\r\n\r\nArabi, on his arrival in Cairo, seems to have had hopes still of\r\ncontinuing the patriotic struggle by defending the city. He went\r\nstraight to the Kasr el Nil and assisted at a council being held there\r\nby the members of the War Committee, but a compromise of opinion was all\r\nthat he could obtain, namely, that while it was decided in principle to\r\nmake submission to the Khedive, the question of defending Cairo against\r\nthe English army was reserved. Nor had the matter got any forwarder next\r\nday when Drury Lowe with his Indian cavalry arrived at Abbassiyeh. The\r\ntruth is all heart had been taken out of the official resistance by the\r\nintrigues of the Khedive's agents, and by Arabi's proclamation by the\r\nSultan as a rebel having become known. Only the rabble of the streets,\r\nas yet ignorant of all, were still in favour of a defence. The military\r\ncircumstances of Cairo were that it possessed nominally a large\r\ngarrison, but these were all the newest of new recruits, and although\r\nthey would probably have been sufficient to hold the citadel and so\r\ndominate the town, they could not have made a long defence without great\r\ndestruction of property in the lower city. For this no one was\r\nprepared, and the sudden arrival of Drury Lowe decided the question with\r\nthe War Committee for capitulation, and it was resolved to send him,\r\naccording to his demand, the keys of the citadel. Arabi then seeing that\r\nall was over, and on the advice of John Ninet, with whom he had spent\r\nthe night in anxious debate at the house of Ali Fehmi, drove to\r\nAbbassiyeh, and there surrendered his sword as prisoner of war to the\r\nEnglish general.[28]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[22] \"It is no exaggeration,\" Lord Dufferin asserted, \"to say that\r\nduring the last few months absolute anarchy has reigned in Egypt. We\r\nhave seen a military faction, without even alleging those pretences to\r\nlegality with which such persons are wont to cloak their designs,\r\nproceed from violence to violence, until insubordination has given place\r\nto mutiny, mutiny to revolt, and revolt to a usurpation of the supreme\r\npower. As a consequence the Administration of the country has been\r\nthrown into confusion; the ordinary operations of the merchant have come\r\nto a standstill; the fellahin, no longer finding purchasers for their\r\nproduce, are unable to pay the land-tax, and the revenues of Egypt are\r\nfailing. This state of things has placed in extreme jeopardy those\r\ncommercial interests in which the subjects of all the Powers are so\r\ndeeply concerned. Not only so, but those special engagements into which\r\nthe Governments of France and England had entered with Egypt have been\r\nrepudiated; the officers appointed to carry them into effect have been\r\nexcluded from the control they were authorized to exercise, and the\r\nsystem which had begun to work so greatly to the advantage of the\r\nindustrious cultivators of Egypt has been broken up and overthrown.\r\n\r\n\"But these effects form only a portion of the deplorable situation which\r\nhas excited the anxiety of Europe. It is not merely the public creditor\r\nwho has suffered extensive damage. The life and property of every\r\nindividual European in the country have become insecure. Of this\r\ninsecurity we have had a most melancholy and convincing proof in the\r\nbrutal massacre by an insolent mob of a number of unoffending persons at\r\nAlexandria, and in the sudden flight from Cairo and the interior (a\r\nflight which implies loss to all and ruin to many) of thousands of our\r\nrespective citizens.\r\n\r\n\"It is evident that such a condition of affairs requires a prompt and\r\nenergetic remedy.\"\r\n\r\n[23] The following is from my journal of 1887: \"_January 31_,\r\nCairo.--Called on Princess Nazli. She is at least as clever as she is\r\npretty. Her conversation would be brilliant in any society in the world.\r\nShe told us a great deal that interested us about Arabi, for whom she\r\nhad, and I am glad to see still has, a great _culte_, talking of his\r\nsingleness of mind and lamenting his overthrow. 'He was not good enough\r\na soldier,' she said, 'and has too good a heart. These were his faults.\r\nIf he had been a violent man like my grandfather, Mehemet Ali, he would\r\nhave taken Tewfik and all of us to the citadel and cut our heads\r\noff--and he would have been now happily reigning, or if he could have\r\ngot the Khedive to go on honestly with him he would have made a great\r\nking of him. Arabi was the first Egyptian Minister who made the\r\nEuropeans obey him. In his time at least the Mohammedans held up their\r\nheads, and the Greeks and Italians did not dare transgress the law. I\r\nhave told Tewfik this more than once. Now there is nobody to keep order.\r\nThe Egyptians alone are kept under by the police, and the Europeans do\r\nas they like.'\"\r\n\r\n[24] See Appendix.\r\n\r\n[25] I find the following in my diary of 1887: \"_February 13._--A visit\r\nfrom Abd-el-Salaam Moëlhy (one of the original Constitutionalists, and\r\nmember of the Chamber of 1882). He told me that he had been an intimate\r\nfriend and partisan of Sultan Pasha's, and had been one of those who\r\njoined Sultan in his quarrel with Arabi, but they were all very sorry\r\nnow for not having held together; and he did not approve Sultan's\r\nconduct during the war. Sultan had been deceived by Malet, who induced\r\nhim to act as he did on a distinct promise that the Egyptian Parliament\r\nshould be respected in its rights. Malet gave this verbally, and Sultan\r\nasked to have it in writing, but was dissuaded from insisting by the\r\nKhedive, who assured him that the English Agent's word was as good as\r\nhis bond. The old man, when he found out after the war how much he had\r\nbeen deceived, took it to heart and died expressing a hope that Arabi\r\nwould forgive him, and that his name would not be handed down to\r\nposterity as the betrayer of his country. It was jealousy and anger at\r\nArabi having become Minister that caused the quarrel.\"\r\n\r\n[26] I give this version of the capture as being that of Mahmud Fehmi\r\nhimself, but some have recounted it otherwise, accusing him of\r\ndesertion. This is, however, not credited by those who knew him\r\npersonally.\r\n\r\n[27] In 1884 I received an account of Arabi's conduct at Tel-el-Kebir,\r\nalmost identical with Sid Ahmed's, from his army doctor, Mustafa Bey,\r\nwho was sleeping near him that night. His own account of his flight will\r\nbe found in the Appendix.\r\n\r\n[28] I find in my journal of 1884 that on the 29th October the Egyptian\r\nprinces, Osman and Kiamyl, came to see me, and that they talked\r\npatriotically about the late war, and gave me much information. \"Osman\r\nwas not actually there. He was too fat a prince to do anything\r\nphysically, but he sympathized with the cause, and behaved with some\r\ndignity after it was over. Kiamyl was a member of the provisional\r\ngovernment, and saw a good deal of Arabi during the war, and while\r\nbearing testimony to his honest patriotism, blamed him for his too easy\r\nconduct of affairs. He ought, he said, to have shot Ali Yusuf after\r\nKassassin, for it was perfectly well known he was a traitor, having\r\nreceived five thousand pounds before the battle, which was thus lost. At\r\none moment there were 18,000 Egyptians close to 2,500 English, who had\r\nwith them the Duke of Connaught. If Ali Yusuf, who commanded the centre,\r\nhad advanced then, the English must have been crushed and the prince\r\ntaken, but he left the field of battle, and allowed the wings to be\r\nbroken. The money paid by the English was most of it false St. George\r\nsovereigns and Egyptian pounds with lead inside. Cairo was full of them\r\nafter Tel-el-Kebir, but they were bought up for the Government by the\r\nbankers at five and ten francs apiece in a few days. The money orders\r\nwere also mostly forgeries, but Ali Yusuf insisted upon having an order\r\nwith a signature he knew. Abd-el-Ghaffar was paid in false St. George\r\nsovereigns, some of which his wife took to Ismaïl Jawdat's wife to\r\nchange. Prince Kiamyl had himself broken open some of these pieces and\r\nfound them to contain lead. The Bedouins would not be taken in thus, and\r\nSaoud el Tihawi had told him after the war that he had received--I\r\nforget the sum--in silver dollars from one of the English generals. The\r\nwhole state of things was very disgraceful, and Kiamyl was under orders\r\nto go in three days to Tel-el-Kebir to arrest Ali Yusuf when the\r\ncollapse came. Arabi was betrayed by all about him, some for gold,\r\nothers for jealousy. Mahmud Sami was jealous of Arabi, and spoilt the\r\nsecond battle of Kassassin because he was not in chief command. He was\r\nto advance from Salahieh, and did not keep his rendezvous with Ali\r\nFehmi--the latter was an honest and good soldier, but most of them were\r\nvery worthless. Arabi would not put any Turk into high command, and the\r\nfellah officers were incapable and cowardly. Mahmud Sami was the only\r\nTurk, and he was playing a selfish game throughout. Kiamyl was present\r\nat the council at the Kasr-el-Nil when Arabi returned and when he\r\nexplained the destruction of the army with floods of tears. He said he\r\nhad fought till he was alone, which was hardly true, and that all was\r\nover. Kiamyl then reproached him, saying, 'A man who embarks in a great\r\nenterprise ought first to count the cost.' 'Arabi ought never,' he said,\r\n'to have been at the head of the army. If he had hanged or shot a dozen\r\nmen in the early part of the war, all would have gone well.' Prince\r\nKiamyl would not hear of the campaign having been a complete walk over\r\nfor the English.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Mohammed Sid Ahmed Arabi had with him a body of about 1,000\r\nencamped near him at Tel-el-Kebir, most of whom were slain before his\r\nmaster left the field. But I do not attach full credit to this, at least\r\nas to numbers. There seem to have been some 10,000 Egyptians in all\r\nkilled or wounded in the battle--mostly killed, for little quarter was\r\ngiven--but I do not pretend to answer for any of the figures named. The\r\nimmense mounds of the buried dead tell their own tale perhaps best.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE ARABI TRIAL\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile these great events were happening on the Nile, I at my home at\r\nCrabbet spent the summer sadly enough. My sympathies were, of course,\r\nstill all with the Egyptians, but I was cut off from every means of\r\ncommunication with them, and the war fever was running too strongly\r\nduring the first weeks of the fighting for further words of mine to be\r\nof any avail. Publicly I held my peace. All that I could do was\r\nto prepare an \"Apologia\" of the National movement and of my own\r\nconnection with it--for this was now being virulently attacked in the\r\npress[29]--and wait the issue of the campaign.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, though in dire disgrace with the Government, I did not\r\nwholly lose touch with Downing Street. I saw Hamilton once or twice, and\r\nsubmitted proofs of my \"Apologia\" to him and Mr. Gladstone before it was\r\npublished, and this was counted to me by them for righteousness. It\r\nappeared in the September number of \"The Nineteenth Century Review,\"\r\nand at a favourable moment when the first sparkle of military glory had\r\nfaded, and reasonable people were beginning to ask themselves what after\r\nall we were fighting in Egypt about. Written from the heart even more\r\nthan from the head, my pleading had a success far beyond expectation\r\nand, taken in connection with an anti-war tour embarked on in the\r\nprovinces by Sir Wilfrid Lawson, Mr. Seymour Keay and a few other\r\ngenuine Radicals, touched at last what was called the \"Nonconformist\"\r\nconscience of the country and turned the tide of opinion distinctly in\r\nmy favour. This encouraged me. About the same time, too, a letter\r\nreached me from General Gordon, dated \"Cape Town, the 3rd of August,\" in\r\nwhich he avowed his sympathy with the cause I had been advocating, and\r\nwhich elated me not a little. It was as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"Cape Town, 3, 8, 82.\r\n\r\n     \"_My Dear Mr. Blunt_,\r\n\r\n     \"You say in 'Times' you are going to publish an account of what\r\n     passed between you and the Government. Kindly let me have a copy\r\n     addressed as enclosed card. I have written a MS. bringing things\r\n     down from Cave's mission to the taking of office by Cherif, it is\r\n     called 'Israel in Egypt,' and shall follow it with a sequel, 'The\r\n     Exodus.' I do not know whether I shall print it, for it is not\r\n     right to rejoice over one's enemies. I mean _official_ enemies.\r\n     What a fearful mess Malet and Colvin have made, and one cannot help\r\n     remarking the _finale_ of all Dilke's, Colvin's, and Malet's\r\n     secretiveness. Dilke, especially, in the House evaded every query\r\n     on the plea that British interests would suffer. Poor thing. I\r\n     firmly believe he knows no more of his policy than the Foreign\r\n     Office porter did; he had none. Could things have ended worse if he\r\n     had said everything? I think not. No more Control--no more employés\r\n     drawing £373,000 a year--no more influence of Consuls-General, a\r\n     nation hating us--no more Tewfik--no more interest--a bombarded\r\n     town, Alexandria--these are the results of the grand secret\r\n     diplomacy. Colvin will go off to India, Malet to China--we shall\r\n     know no more of them. All this because Controllers and\r\n     Consuls-General would not let Notables see the Budget when Cherif\r\n     was in office. As for Arabi, whatever may become of him\r\n     individually, he will live for centuries in the people; they will\r\n     never be 'your obedient servants' again.\r\n\r\n     \"Believe me, yours sincerely,\r\n\r\n     \"C. G. GORDON.\"\r\n\r\nThe value to me of this letter I saw at once was great, for, though out\r\nof favour with the Foreign Office, Gordon's name was one to conjure with\r\nin the popular mind, and especially with that \"Nonconformist conscience\"\r\nwhich, as I have said, was beginning now to support me, and consequently\r\nI knew with Gladstone; and it was on the text of it that I began a fresh\r\ncorrespondence with Hamilton. Mr. Gladstone had stated in Parliament\r\nthat I was the \"one unfortunate exception,\" among Englishmen who knew\r\nEgypt, to the general approval of the war; and I sent him, through\r\nHamilton, a copy of Gordon's letter, and at the same time invited his\r\nattention to accounts which had begun to appear in the newspapers of\r\ncertain atrocities of vengeance which had been indulged in by Tewfik and\r\nhis new Circassian Ministers at Alexandria on Nationalist prisoners made\r\nduring the war. Torture had, it was related, been inflicted on Mahmud\r\nFehmi, the engineer General, and the thumbscrew and kurbash were being\r\nused freely. I asked whether such was the state of things Mr. Gladstone\r\nhad sent troops to Egypt to re-establish. The letter brought a prompt\r\nand interesting answer, and one which proved of value to me a few days\r\nlater when it came to my pleading that Arabi should not be done to death\r\nby the Khedive without fair trial.\r\n\r\n     \"10, Downing Street, Whitehall,\r\n\r\n     \"_September 8th, 1882_.\r\n\r\n     \"I need hardly say that Mr. Gladstone has been much exercised in\r\n     his mind at the rumours about these 'atrocities.' I can call them\r\n     by no other name. Immediate instructions were sent out to inquire\r\n     into the truth of them, and to remonstrate strongly if they were\r\n     confirmed. I am glad to say that, as far as our information at\r\n     present goes, the statements appear to be unfounded. The strictest\r\n     orders have been given for the humane treatment of the prisoners.\r\n     There seems to be some doubt as to whether thumbscrewing was not\r\n     inflicted on a spy in one case; and searching inquiries are to be\r\n     instituted with peremptory demands of explanation and guarantees\r\n     against recurrence. You may be quite sure that Mr. Gladstone will\r\n     denounce 'Egyptian atrocities' as strongly as 'Bulgarian\r\n     atrocities.'\r\n\r\n     \"I cannot help thinking that your and Chinese Gordon's opinion of\r\n     Arabi would be somewhat modified if you had seen some of the\r\n     documents I have read.\r\n\r\n     \"Some months ago (this, please, is quite private) certain inquiries\r\n     were made about Chinese Gordon. He had suggestions to make about\r\n     Ireland, and the result of these inquiries were, to the best of my\r\n     recollection, that he was not clothed in the rightest of minds.\"\r\n\r\nThe last paragraph is historically curious. The proof Gordon had given\r\nMr. Gladstone's Government of his not being clothed in his right mind\r\nwas that he had written, during a tour in western Ireland, to a member\r\nof the Government, Lord Northbrook, recommending a scheme of Land\r\nPurchase and, if I remember rightly, Home Rule as a cure for Irish\r\nevils.\r\n\r\nI was thus once more in a position of semi-friendly intercourse with\r\nDowning Street and of some considerable influence in the country when\r\nthe crowning glory of the war, the news of the great victory of\r\nTel-el-Kebir, reached England, and soon after it of Arabi's being a\r\nprisoner in Drury Lowe's hands at Cairo. The completeness of the\r\nmilitary success for the moment turned all English heads, and it was\r\nfortunate for me that I had had my say a fortnight before it came, for\r\notherwise I should have been unable to make my voice heard, either with\r\nthe public or at Downing Street, in the general shriek of triumph. It\r\nhad the immediate result of confirming the Government in all its most\r\nviolent views, and of once more turning Mr. Gladstone's heart, which had\r\nbeen veering back a little to the Nationalists, to the hardness of a\r\nnether millstone. The danger now was that in order to justify to his own\r\nconscience the immense slaughter of half-armed peasants that had been\r\nmade at Tel-el-Kebir, he would indulge in some conspicuous act of\r\nvengeance on Arabi, as the scapegoat of his own errors. His only excuse\r\nfor all this military brutality was the fiction that he was dealing with\r\na military desperado, a man outlawed by his crimes, and, as such,\r\nunentitled to any consideration either as a patriot or even the\r\nrecognized General of a civilized army. I have reason to know that if\r\nArabi had been captured on the field at Tel-el-Kebir, it was Wolseley's\r\nintention to give him the short benefit of a drum-head court martial,\r\nwhich means shooting on the spot, and that it was only the intervention\r\nof Sir John Adye, a General much older in years and in length of service\r\nthan Wolseley, that prevented it later--Adye having represented to\r\nWolseley the disgrace there would be to the British army if the regular\r\ncommander of an armed force, whom it had needed 30,000 troops to subdue,\r\nshould not receive the honourable treatment universally accorded to\r\nprisoners of war. At home, too, I equally know that Bright, in indignant\r\nprotest, gave his mind on the same point personally to Gladstone. It\r\nmust not, however, at all be supposed that anything but the overwhelming\r\npressure of public opinion brought to bear, as I will presently\r\ndescribe, frustrated the determination of our Government, one way or\r\nother, to make Arabi pay forfeit for their own political crime with his\r\nlife. Mr. Gladstone was as much resolved on this as was Lord Granville,\r\nor any of the Whig lords in his Cabinet. To explain how their hands were\r\nforced in the direction of humanity I must go into detail.\r\n\r\nThe capitulation of Cairo and Arabi's surrender to Drury Lowe were\r\nannounced in the \"Times\" of the 16th, and with it a telegram from its\r\nAlexandria correspondent, Moberley Bell, who represented the\r\nAnglo-Khedivial official view, demanding \"exemplary punishment\" on\r\neleven of the National leaders, whom he named, including Arabi. I knew\r\nthat this could only mean mischief resolved on of the gravest kind, and\r\nI consequently telegraphed at once to Button, asking him what the\r\nposition in official circles was. His first answer was reassuring. \"I\r\ncan't think there is the least danger of their shooting anybody. You\r\nshould, however, take immediate steps to appeal for merciful treatment.\"\r\nTwo hours later, however, a second message from him came. \"I don't like\r\nofficial tone with regard to your friends. Write me privately such a\r\nletter as I can show to my chief.\" By his \"chief\" he, of course meant\r\nChenery, the \"Times\" editor, with whom, as I have said, he was on very\r\nintimate terms. I consequently wrote at once to Hamilton:\r\n\r\n     \"I cannot think there should be any danger of death for the\r\n     prisoners taken at Cairo, but should there be, I trust you will\r\n     let me know in time, as I have certain suggestions to make\r\n     regarding the extreme difficulty of obtaining them a fair trial\r\n     just now, and other matters.\"\r\n\r\nTo this it is significant that I received no answer for two days, and\r\nthen an off-hand one, to the effect that Hamilton was about to leave\r\nLondon for the country, \"and so would be a bad person to depend upon for\r\nany intimation such as I wished.\" But I was not thus to be put off, and\r\npassing beyond Hamilton, I wrote once more direct to Mr. Gladstone. I\r\ndid this after consultation with Button and with Broadley, whom I met at\r\nhis house on the afternoon of the 19th. We decided that the latter would\r\nbe the man for our purpose, and that the best chance of saving Arabi's\r\nand the other prisoners' lives would be for me to take Broadley out with\r\nme at once and produce him as their legal defender. Button, who knew the\r\nins and outs of most affairs, was certain there was no time to lose, and\r\nwe half engaged Broadley at a fee of £300, afterwards increased to £800\r\nwith refreshers. In the meantime Button rendered the cause a great\r\nservice in the immediate crisis by managing that it should be announced\r\nnext morning in the \"Times\" that Arabi and his companions were not to be\r\nexecuted without the consent of the English Government, and that they\r\nwere to be defended by efficient counsel. Of course, we had not a shadow\r\nof authority to go upon for this statement, but the \"Times\" having\r\nannounced it made it very difficult for the Government to go back upon a\r\nhumane decision so publicly attributed to them.\r\n\r\nMy letter to Mr. Gladstone, sent in the same evening, was as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"_Sept. 19, 1882._\r\n\r\n     \"MY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n     \"Now that the military resistance of the Egyptians is at an end,\r\n     and Arabi and their chief leaders have surrendered to Her Majesty's\r\n     forces, I venture once more to address you in the interests of\r\n     justice no less than of those whom the fortune of war has thus\r\n     suddenly thrown into your hands. It would seem to be contemplated\r\n     that a Court Martial should assemble shortly to try and judge the\r\n     military leaders for rebellion, and, in the case of some of these,\r\n     and of civil tribunal to inquire into their alleged connection\r\n     with certain violent proceedings. If this should be the truth, I\r\n     would earnestly beg your attention to certain circumstances of the\r\n     case which seem to demand careful consideration.\r\n\r\n     \"1. The members of the proposed Court Martial, if Egyptians and\r\n     appointed by the Khedive, can hardly be free agents or uninfluenced\r\n     in their feelings towards the prisoners. They would be chosen from\r\n     among the few officers who espoused the Khedive's cause, and would\r\n     of necessity be partisans.\r\n\r\n     \"2. Even were this not the case, native false witness is so common\r\n     in Egypt, and the falsification of Arabic documents so easy, that\r\n     little reliance could be placed upon the testimony adduced. The\r\n     latter would need to be submitted to experts before being accepted\r\n     with any certainty.\r\n\r\n     \"3. Native evidence, if favourable to the prisoners, will be given\r\n     under fear. There will be a strong inducement to withhold it, and\r\n     as strong an inducement in the desire of Court favour to offer\r\n     evidence unfavourable. The experts charged with examining documents\r\n     will, if natives, be equally subject to these influences.\r\n\r\n     \"4. The evidence of Europeans settled in Egypt, though given\r\n     without fear of consequences, may be expected to be strongly\r\n     coloured by resentment. These Europeans are, it would seem,\r\n     themselves in some measure parties to the suit. They will many of\r\n     them have lost property or have been injured in their trade during\r\n     the late troubles or have personal insults to avenge. The\r\n     vindictive tone of the English in Egypt is every day apparent in\r\n     their letters published by the English Press.\r\n\r\n     \"5. It will be insufficient, if full justice for the prisoners is\r\n     to be secured, that the ordinary form of Her Majesty's\r\n     representative being present through a dragoman or otherwise, at\r\n     the proceedings, should be the only one observed. Political feeling\r\n     has probably run too high at Cairo during the last six months for\r\n     quite impartial observation.\r\n\r\n     \"6. Should English officers, as it may be hoped will be the case,\r\n     be added to the native members of the Court Martial, they will be\r\n     ignorant or nearly ignorant of the language spoken by the\r\n     prisoners, and will be unable themselves to examine the documents\r\n     or cross-examine the witnesses. They will necessarily be in the\r\n     hands of their interpreters, who, if unchecked, may alter or\r\n     distort the words used to the detriment of the prisoners. Nearly\r\n     all the dragomans of the Consulates are Levantine Christians\r\n     violently hostile to the Mussulman Arabs, while it may safely be\r\n     affirmed that there are no Englishmen in Egypt both fully competent\r\n     and quite unbiassed who could be secured in this capacity. Arabic\r\n     is a language little known among our officials, and their\r\n     connection with the late troubles is too recent to have left them\r\n     politically calm.\r\n\r\n     \"It would seem, therefore, that unless special steps are taken\r\n     there is grave danger of a miscarriage of justice in the trial.\r\n\r\n     \"To remedy this evil as far as possible I have decided, at my own\r\n     charge and that of some of my friends, to secure the services of a\r\n     competent English counsel for the principal prisoners, and to\r\n     proceed with him to Cairo to collect evidence for the defence. I\r\n     shall also take with me the Rev. Mr. Sabunji as interpreter, and\r\n     watch the proceedings on behalf of the prisoners. My knowledge of\r\n     Arabic is too imperfect for me to act alone, but Mr. Sabunji is a\r\n     friend of the chief prisoners, and is eminently capable of speaking\r\n     for them. He knows English, French, Turkish, and Italian well, and\r\n     is probably the first Arabic scholar now living. The prisoners have\r\n     full confidence in him, and I believe also that they have full\r\n     confidence in me. Thus alone, perhaps, they will obtain, what I\r\n     submit they are entitled to, a full, a fair, and--to some\r\n     extent--even a friendly hearing.\r\n\r\n     \"In conclusion, it may not be unnecessary that I should promise you\r\n     that while thus engaged I, and those with me, would scrupulously\r\n     avoid all interference with contemporary politics. I shall esteem\r\n     it a favour if I can be informed at as early a date as possible\r\n     what will be the exact nature of the trial and what the principal\r\n     charges made. I hope, too, that every facility will be accorded me\r\n     and those with me in Egypt to prosecute our task, and I cannot\r\n     doubt that your personal sense of justice will approve it.\r\n\r\n     \"I am, &c.,\r\n\r\n     \"WILFRID SCAWEN BLUNT.\"\r\n\r\nThis letter, which I knew it would be difficult for Mr. Gladstone to\r\nanswer with a refusal, especially after his recent assurances about\r\n\"Egyptian atrocities\" and \"Bulgarian atrocities,\" I sent at once to\r\nDowning Street, having previously called there and seen Hamilton,\r\nto whom I explained my plan. He did not, however, give me much\r\nencouragement, as his answer to a further note I sent him next morning\r\nproves. My note was that I was writing to Arabi, and to ask him how the\r\nletter should be sent, and expressing a hope to have an answer from his\r\nChief before Friday, the next mail day. Hamilton's answer suggests\r\nprocrastination:\r\n\r\n     \"Your letter, I am sorry to say, just missed the bag last night. It\r\n     reached me about three minutes too late; but in any case I don't\r\n     think you must count on a very immediate reply. Mr. Gladstone is\r\n     moving about, and moreover will most likely have to consult some\r\n     one before he gives an answer. I am absolutely ignorant myself as\r\n     to questions which your intended proceedings may raise; and\r\n     therefore I have no business to hazard an opinion. But is it not\r\n     open to doubt whether according to international law or\r\n     prescription a man can be defended by foreign counsel? I am equally\r\n     ignorant about the delivery of letters to prisoners of war; but I\r\n     should presume that no communication could reach Arabi except\r\n     through and with the permission of the Khedive and our\r\n     Commander-in-Chief. In any case Malet will probably be your best\r\n     means of communication.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to this suggestion I wrote a letter to Arabi telling him of\r\nour plans of legal defence and enclosed it, with a draft of the letter,\r\nto Malet, and for more precaution sent both by hand to the Foreign\r\nOffice, to be forwarded, with a note to Lord Tenterden commending it to\r\nhis care. By a singular accident, however, both note and letter were\r\nreturned to me with the message that His Lordship had died suddenly that\r\nmorning, and I was obliged, as the mail was starting, to send it by the\r\nsame hand, Button's servant Mitchell, to Walmer Castle where Lord\r\nGranville was, and it was only just in time. In the sequel it will be\r\nseen that the packet, though despatched to Cairo, was not delivered\r\nfarther than into Malet's hands and then with the instruction that my\r\nletter to Arabi should be returned to me. Malet's official letter to me\r\nperforming his duty is sufficient evidence, if any were needed, to show\r\nhow far the Government was from co-operating at all with me in my\r\ndesign of getting the prisoners a fair trial. It is very formal and\r\nunmistakable:\r\n\r\n     \"Cairo, _Oct. 4, 1882_.\r\n\r\n     \"SIR,\r\n\r\n     \"Acting under instructions from Her Majesty's Principal Secretary\r\n     of State I return you herewith the letter for Arabi Pasha which you\r\n     sent to me to be forwarded in your letter of the 22nd ultimo.\r\n\r\n     \"I am, etc., EDWARD B. MALET.\"\r\n\r\nMy letter to Arabi had been as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"_To My Honourable Friend H. E. Ahmed Pasha Arabi._\r\n\r\n     \"May God preserve you in adversity as in good fortune.\r\n\r\n     \"As a soldier and a patriot you will have understood the reasons\r\n     which have prevented me from writing to you or sending you any\r\n     message during the late unhappy war. Now, however, that the war is\r\n     over, I hope to show you that our friendship has not been one of\r\n     words only. It seems probable that you will be brought to trial,\r\n     either for rebellion or on some other charge, the nature of which I\r\n     yet hardly know, and that, unless you are strongly and skilfully\r\n     defended, you run much risk of being precipitately condemned. I\r\n     have therefore resolved, with your approval, to come to Cairo to\r\n     help you with such evidence as I can give, and to bring with me an\r\n     honest and learned English advocate to conduct your defence; and I\r\n     have informed the English Government of my intention. I beg you,\r\n     therefore, without delay, to authorize me to act for you in this\r\n     matter--for your formal assent is necessary; and it would be well\r\n     if you would at once send me a telegram, and also a written letter,\r\n     to authorize me to engage counsel in your name. Several\r\n     liberal-minded Englishmen of high position will join me in\r\n     defraying all the expenses of your case. You may also count upon\r\n     me, personally, to see, during your captivity, that your family is\r\n     not left in want. And so may God give you courage to endure the\r\n     evil with the good.\r\n\r\n     \"WILFRID SCAWEN BLUNT.\r\n\r\n     \"_Sept. 22, 1882._ \"Crabbet Park, Threebridges, Sussex.\"\r\n\r\nGladstone's answer, which came sooner than I expected, shows as little\r\ndisposition to favour any idea of a fair trial as was that of the\r\nForeign Office. It came in this form from Hamilton:\r\n\r\n     \"10 Downing Street,\r\n\r\n     \"_Sept. 22, 1882_.\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Gladstone has read the letter which you have addressed to him\r\n     about Arabi's trial and your proposal to employ English counsel.\r\n     All that he can say at the present moment is that he will bring\r\n     your request under the notice of Lord Granville with whom he will\r\n     consult, but that he cannot hold out any assurance that it will\r\n     admit of being complied with.\"\r\n\r\nThis was very plain discouragement, though short of a direct refusal,\r\nand a few words added by Hamilton in a separate note were even more so:\r\n\"I confess,\" he says, \"that the more I think of it the greater is the\r\nnumber of difficulties which present themselves to my mind involved by\r\nsuch a proposal as yours. You will, I presume, hear further on the\r\nsubject in a day or two but not from me, because I am off as you know.\"\r\n\r\nI was left, therefore, still in doubts while the situation was daily\r\nbecoming more critical. I dared not leave for Egypt without having\r\nreceived a definite answer, for I knew that at Cairo I should be\r\npowerless, if unarmed with any Government authority, and should probably\r\nnot even be allowed to see the prisoners, while Broadley, tired of\r\nwaiting, had gone back to Tunis. The Parliamentary session was over and\r\nevery one was leaving London, the work of the Ministers being left to\r\nUnder-Secretaries, and all business practically at a standstill.\r\nMeanwhile the question of Arabi's death was being keenly debated in the\r\nPress, and all the Jingo papers were clamouring for his execution, only\r\nhere and there a feeble voice being raised in protest. Sir Wilfrid\r\nLawson's Egyptian Committee, which had done such good work during the\r\nsummer, had become silent, and from Lawson himself I received just then\r\na most desponding letter: \"I greatly doubt,\" he said, \"whether they will\r\nallow Arabi to have anything like a _fair_ trial. They know well enough\r\nthat if they do it will end in their own condemnation, and 'Statesmen'\r\nare too crafty to be led into anything of that sort. At any rate you\r\nare right in _trying_ to get fair play for him.\" All I could do was to\r\nstay on in London and still worry Downing Street for an answer and go on\r\nprompting the \"Times.\" Therefore, after waiting five more days, I wrote\r\nagain to Gladstone for a definite answer, the situation having become to\r\nthe last degree critical at Cairo.\r\n\r\n     \"_Sept. 27, 1882._\r\n\r\n     \"I wrote to you about ten days ago, stating my intention of\r\n     engaging competent English counsel for Arabi Pasha and the other\r\n     chief Egyptian prisoners in case they should be brought to trial,\r\n     and of going myself to Cairo to procure evidence for them and watch\r\n     the proceedings; and I begged you to give me early notice of any\r\n     decision that might be come to regarding them.\r\n\r\n     \"Your reply, through Mr. Hamilton, though giving me no assurance\r\n     that English counsel would be allowed seemed to suggest that my\r\n     proposal would be considered; and I accordingly retained,\r\n     provisionally, a barrister of eminence to act for the prisoners,\r\n     should it be decided they should be thus defended. In view also of\r\n     the legal necessity of gaining the prisoners' consent to the\r\n     arrangement, I wrote, under cover to Sir Edward Malet, to Arabi\r\n     Pasha, begging his authorization of my thus defending him, a letter\r\n     to which I have as yet received no answer; nor have I received any\r\n     further communication from yourself or from Lord Granville, to whom\r\n     you informed me the matter would be referred.\r\n\r\n     \"Now, however, I see it reported in the 'Times,' from Cairo, that a\r\n     Military Court to try all offenders will be named no later than\r\n     to-morrow, the paragraph being as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"'The Military Court to try all offenders will be named tomorrow.\r\n     The Khedive, Sherif, and Riaz all insist strongly on the absolute\r\n     necessity of the capital punishment of the prime offenders, an\r\n     opinion from which there are few, if any, dissentients. Sherif,\r\n     whose gentleness of character is well known, said to me to-day: \"It\r\n     is not because I have a feeling of spite against any of them, but\r\n     because it is absolutely necessary for the security of all who wish\r\n     to live in the country. An English expedition is an excellent\r\n     thing, but neither you nor we want it repeated every twelve\r\n     months.\"'[30]\r\n\r\n     \"If this statement is true it would seem to confirm my worst\r\n     suspicions as to the foregone decision of the Khedive's advisers to\r\n     take the prisoners' lives, and to justify all my arguments as to\r\n     the improbability of their obtaining a fair trial. I therefore\r\n     venture once more to urge a proper legal defence being granted\r\n     them, such as I have suggested; and, in any case, to beg that you\r\n     will relieve me of further doubt and, if it must be so,\r\n     responsibility in the matter, by stating clearly whether English\r\n     counsel will be allowed or refused in the case of Arabi Pasha and\r\n     the chief prisoners, and whether proper facilities can be promised\r\n     me in Egypt of communicating with the prisoners, and obtaining them\r\n     competent interpretation.\r\n\r\n     \"In the present state of official feeling at Cairo, it would be\r\n     manifestly impossible for me, and those I have proposed to take\r\n     with me, to work effectually for the prisoners without special\r\n     diplomatic protection and even assistance.\r\n\r\n     \"The urgency of the case must be my excuse with you for begging an\r\n     immediate answer.\"\r\n\r\nThis last letter, however, never reached its destination. Gladstone had\r\nleft London, and Horace Seymour, his secretary in charge of his\r\ncorrespondence, under cover to whom I had sent it, handed it on, whether\r\nby order or not I do not know, to the Foreign Office. \"Mr. Gladstone,\"\r\nhe explained, \"is out of Town, so upon receipt of your letter yesterday\r\nI sent the further communication which you addressed to him straight to\r\nthe Foreign Office.... I did so because he had placed your former letter\r\nin Lord Granville's hands, as Hamilton informed you, and also because I\r\ngathered from your note that this would meet your wish and save time. I\r\nunderstand that you will shortly receive an official reply from Lord\r\nGranville conveying to you the view of the Government on the matters to\r\nwhich you refer.\" Gladstone therefore, had shifted his responsibility of\r\nsaying \"yes\" or \"no\" on to Granville, and Granville being of course also\r\nout of town it was left for the Foreign Office clerks to deal with\r\naccording to their ways. In spite of Seymour's promise that the view of\r\nthe Government would shortly be conveyed to me, all the answer I\r\nreceived was one signed \"Julian Pauncefote,\" stating that Mr. Gladstone\r\nhad referred my two letters of the 19th and 27th to Lord Granville, and\r\nthat Lord Granville regretted that he did not feel justified in entering\r\ninto correspondence with me on the subject. It was thus that Gladstone,\r\nwho had made up his mind that Arabi should be executed no less than had\r\nthe Foreign Office, finally evaded the responsibility with which I had\r\nsought to bind him. I give the incident in detail as an illustration of\r\nofficial craft no less than as one of historical importance.\r\n\r\nThis \"Pauncefote\" reply decided us to waste no more time. In\r\nconsultation with Button and with Lord De la Warr, who had come to\r\nLondon and had been working to get an answer from Lord Granville on\r\nindependent lines, and who now offered to share with me the costs of the\r\ntrial if we could secure one (a promise which I may note Lord De la Warr\r\nfailed to redeem), it was agreed that we should telegraph at once to\r\nBroadley at Tunis to hold himself in readiness to proceed to Egypt, and\r\nthat in the meanwhile we should send out to Cairo by that very night's\r\nmail the first briefless barrister we could lay our hands on as\r\nBroadley's junior till his arrival, and be on the spot to act as\r\ncircumstances should suggest. Lord Granville had not agreed, nor had he\r\nat that time the least intention of agreeing, to the appearance of\r\nEnglish counsel on behalf of the prisoners. But the \"Times,\" as we have\r\nseen, had already committed the Government to a statement that Arabi was\r\nnot to be executed without its consent, and that he was to be defended\r\nby efficient counsel; and this they had not the face publicly to\r\ndisavow. And now Button's influence was so great with Chenery that he\r\nwas confident he could again force Lord Granville's hand in the matter\r\nof English counsel through the insistence of the \"Times\" on a fair\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\nAll that day, therefore, we searched the Inns of Court, which were\r\nalmost empty, it being holiday time, and it was only at the last moment\r\nthat we were fortunate enough to light upon the man we wanted. This was\r\nMark Napier, than whom we could not have found a better agent for our\r\npurpose, a resourceful and determined fighter with a good knowledge of\r\nthe law and one difficult to rebuff. He had the immense advantage, too,\r\nthrough his being the son of a former British Ambassador, of\r\nunderstanding the common usages and ways of diplomacy as also of\r\nspeaking French fluently, a very necessary qualification at Cairo.\r\nHaving agreed to go he received our short instructions, which were that\r\nhe was to go straight to Malet and say that he had arrived as Arabi's\r\ncounsel, and insist on seeing his client. This was all he could hope at\r\npresent to achieve, and if he could do this he would do much. If Malet\r\nshould refuse he was to protest and take advantage of every opening\r\ngiven him to emphasize the refusal. Above all he was to keep us\r\nconstantly informed by telegram of what was going on, while we on our\r\nside would fight the battle no less energetically at the Foreign Office\r\nand in the Press. Mark, as I have said, had the great advantage of\r\nhaving had a diplomatic training and so could not be imposed upon by the\r\nprestige and mystery with which diplomacy is invested for outsiders, and\r\nwhich gives it so much of its strength. We could not possibly have lit\r\nupon a better man. He started, as proposed, that night by the Brindisi\r\nmail, taking with him a cipher code and two or three letters of\r\nintroduction. That, with a hand-bag, was all his luggage.\r\n\r\nAs to myself, De la Warr, who knew the temper of the Foreign Office and\r\ntheir personal rage against me, was very insistent that I should not go\r\nto Cairo and to this I assented. At Cairo I should have been only\r\nwatched by spies, possibly arrested and sent home, while here I could\r\ncontinue far more effectively the Press campaign which, of course, could\r\nonly really win our battle. Button that very night managed a new\r\nmaster-stroke in the \"Times.\" De la Warr had succeeded in getting from\r\nGranville an assurance that all reasonable opportunities would be given\r\nby the Khedive for the defence. This assurance was of course illusory as\r\nfar as a really fair trial went, as the only legal assistance procurable\r\nat the time by the prisoners at Cairo was that of the various Levantine\r\nlawyers who practised in the international Courts, and these could be no\r\nbetter depended upon than were the terror-stricken native lawyers\r\nthemselves to serve their clients honestly by telling the whole truth,\r\nthough a defence of this perfunctory kind would be sufficient to serve\r\nour Government's purpose of being able, without risk of a conflict with\r\nEnglish popular opinion, to ratify the intended sentences of death. It\r\nwas intended to have the trial in the Egyptian Court over in a couple of\r\ndays, and having proved \"rebellion,\" to proceed at once to execution;\r\nand English counsel would, no doubt, have been ruled out of the\r\nproceedings as a preposterous intervention of foreigners with no legal\r\nstatus in the country.\r\n\r\nGranville's words to De la Warr had been no more than this: \"I have no\r\nreason to doubt that the Khedive, with whom the proper authority rests,\r\nwill give all reasonable opportunities for Arabi's defence which may not\r\ninvolve any extraordinary or unnecessary delay, and it devolves on the\r\nprisoners and their friends to take such measures as they may think fit\r\non their own responsibility.\" This Button cleverly reproduced next\r\nmorning in the \"Times\" as follows: \"Lord Granville has written that\r\nevery reasonable facility will be afforded the prisoners in Egypt and\r\ntheir friends for obtaining counsel for their defence. Mr. Broadley has\r\ntherefore been telegraphed to to go at once to Cairo.\" It is clear from\r\nLord Granville's angry expostulation with Lord De la Warr (see Blue\r\nBook) how little intention he had of having his words thus interpreted.\r\nBut, once published in the \"Times,\" he could not with any decency back\r\nout of the position; and thus by a very simple device we again forced\r\nhis hand and this time on a point which, in the event, gained for us the\r\nwhole battle.[31]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, we were very nearly being tricked out of our fair trial\r\nafter all, and a singularly ugly circumstance of the position in our\r\neyes was the sudden reappearance, just then at Cairo, of Colvin, the man\r\nof all others most interested, after the Khedive, in preventing\r\npublicity. The Foreign Office object clearly now was to hurry on the\r\ntrial, so as to get it over before Broadley should have time to arrive,\r\nfor Tunis was and still is without any direct communication with Egypt,\r\nand it was probable that ten days would elapse before he could be there.\r\nOf Napier's sending they had no knowledge. Orders, therefore, were at\r\nonce given as a first step that Arabi should be transferred from the\r\nsafe keeping of the British Army to the ill-custody of the Khedivial\r\npolice, where communication with the outside world would be effectually\r\nbarred for him without the English Government incurring thereby any\r\nodium. This was done on the 4th of October, two days before Napier's\r\narrival; and the trial was fixed for the 14th, while Broadley did not\r\nsucceed in reaching Cairo till the 18th. Nothing but Napier's unexpected\r\nappearance at the English Agency disarranged the concerted plan.\r\n\r\nA further step taken to hasten the end and make an English defence\r\ndifficult was to select the French criminal military code for use in the\r\ncourt martial, a form which under an unscrupulous government gives great\r\nadvantages to the prosecution. According to it a full interrogatory of\r\nprisoner and witnesses is permitted before these have seen counsel and\r\nthey are thus easily intimidated, if they take a courageous attitude,\r\nfrom repeating their evidence at the trial. Thus both Arabi and others\r\nof his fellow prisoners were during the interval between the\r\ninterrogatory and the day fixed for trial secretly visited by a number\r\nof the Khedive's eunuchs, who brutally assaulted and ill-treated them in\r\ntheir cells with a view of \"breaking their spirit.\" Lastly, the Egyptian\r\nGovernment were permitted to declare that no counsel should be allowed\r\nto plead except in Arabic, thus excluding those we were sending to the\r\nprisoners' help. These particulars were telegraphed me by Napier soon\r\nafter his arrival and made us anxious.\r\n\r\nAll that the English Government had done in some measure to protect the\r\nprisoners from the Khedive's unregulated violence was to appoint two\r\nEnglishmen who had a knowledge of Arabic to be present at the\r\nproceedings. These by a great stroke of good fortune were both honest\r\nand humane men, and, as it happened, old friends of my own, Sir Charles\r\nWilson, whom I had travelled with in 1881 from Aleppo to Smyrna (not to\r\nbe confounded with Sir C. Rivers Wilson), and Ardern Beaman, whom I had\r\nknown at Damascus, and who now was Malet's official interpreter at the\r\nAgency. Both these men had been favourably impressed by Arabi's\r\ndignified bearing during the days of his detention as English prisoner\r\nof war, and now willingly gave Napier what little private help they\r\ncould.\r\n\r\nWith Malet himself Napier succeeded at least so far as to get his status\r\nand that of the solicitor Eve, whom he had fortunately found at Cairo,\r\nrecognized as legal representatives of Arabi's friends, though he could\r\nnot obtain from him any definite promise or more than a vague assurance\r\nthat English counsel would be allowed to represent Arabi himself. His\r\napplications to see his client were constantly put off by Malet by\r\nreferring him to Riaz Pasha, the Khedivial Minister of the Interior, who\r\nas constantly refused, and in the meanwhile the trial was being pushed\r\nforward with all haste, so that it was clear to Napier that he was being\r\nplayed with and that the trial would be over before the question of the\r\nadmissibility of English counsel had been plainly decided.\r\n\r\nThings were standing thus when on the 12th of October I received a\r\nsudden warning from De la Warr, who was still in communication with the\r\nForeign Office: \"From what I hear, unless vigorous steps are taken,\r\nArabi's life is in great danger. You have probably received information\r\nfrom Mr. Napier.\" With this ill news I rushed off immediately to\r\nButton's rooms and there fortunately found him, and as all his\r\ninformation tallied with mine we agreed that a supreme appeal must be\r\nmade to the public, and that the Foreign Office must be directly and\r\nstrongly attacked and Gladstone compromised and forced into a\r\ndeclaration of policy. I consequently sat down and wrote a final letter\r\nto Gladstone, in which I spared nothing in my anger of accusation\r\nagainst Granville and was careful to insist on his own connection with\r\nthe matter, and his early sympathies with the Nationalist leader, and,\r\nwithout troubling ourselves to ask for an answer in Downing Street,\r\nButton \"plumped\" it into next morning's \"Times,\" Chenery generously\r\ngiving it full prominence and directing attention to it in a leading\r\narticle. He had ascertained that the intention of the Government was\r\nthat the trial should commence on Saturday, that sentence should be\r\npronounced on Monday, and that Arabi's execution should instantly\r\nfollow. It was already Friday, so we only had three days (one of them a\r\nSunday when no newspapers are published) in which to rouse English\r\nfeeling against this _coup de Jarnac_. Fortunately it was enough. I\r\nbelieve it was on this occasion that Bright, learning from my letter how\r\nthings stood, went down to Gladstone and told him personally and plainly\r\nthat he would be disgraced through all history as a renegade from his\r\nhumaner principles if he allowed the perpetration of so great a crime.\r\nBe this as it may, the Foreign Office capitulated to us there and then,\r\nand, admitting our plea of the necessity of a fair trial, gave\r\ninstructions to Malet to withdraw his opposition and treat the counsel\r\nsent to Arabi favourably. The following telegram from Napier announces\r\nour success: \"Granville has directed Malet to require that Arabi shall\r\nbe defended by English counsel. Proceedings expected to be lengthy.\"\r\n\r\nI have thought it necessary to go into very minute detail in narrating\r\nthese early phases of Arabi's trial, because in this way only is it\r\npossible to refute the false and absurd legend that has sprung up in\r\nEgypt to the effect that there was from the first some secret\r\nunderstanding between Gladstone and Arabi that his life should be\r\nspared. I can vouch for it, and the documents I have quoted in large\r\nmeasure prove it, that so far from having any sentiment of pity for, or\r\nunderstanding with, the \"arch rebel,\" Gladstone had joined with\r\nGranville in the design to secure his death, through the Khedive's\r\nwilling agency, by a trial which should be one merely of form and should\r\ndisturb no questions, as the surest and speediest method of securing\r\nsilence and a justification for their own huge moral errors of the last\r\nsix months in Egypt. It was no qualm of conscience that prevented\r\nGladstone from carrying it through to the end, only the sudden voice of\r\nthe English public that at the last moment frightened him and warned him\r\nthat it was dangerous for his reputation to go on with the full plan.\r\nThis is the plain truth of the matter, whatever glosses Mr. Gladstone's\r\napologists may put on it to save his humane credit or whatever may be\r\nimagined about it by French political writers desirous of finding an\r\nexplanation for a leniency shown to Arabi after the war, which has\r\nseemed to them inexplicable except on the supposition of some deep\r\nanterior intrigue between the English Prime Minister and the leader of\r\nthe Egyptian rebellion.\r\n\r\nThis supreme point of danger past, it was not altogether difficult to\r\nforesee that the trial could hardly now end otherwise than negatively. A\r\nfair trial in open court with the Khedivial rubbish heap turned up with\r\nan English pitchfork and ransacked for forgotten crimes was a thought\r\nnot to be contemplated by Tewfik without terror, while for the British\r\nGovernment as well there would be revelations destructive of the theory\r\nof past events constructed on the basis of official lies and their own\r\nnecessity of finding excuses for their violence. The Sultan, too, had to\r\nbe safeguarded from untimely revelations. The danger for the prisoners'\r\nlives was not over, but there seemed fair prospect of the thing ending\r\nin a compromise if we could not gain an acquittal. The changed state of\r\nthings at Cairo is announced by Napier as early as the 16th October; and\r\nI will give the rest of my story of the trial mainly in the form of\r\ntelegrams and letters.\r\n\r\n     _Napier to Blunt, Oct. 20th_:\r\n\r\n     \"It is believed the Egyptian Government will try to quash the trial\r\n     altogether, and that the chief prisoners will be directed to leave\r\n     the country. I have not sufficient facts at my command to form a\r\n     judgment on this point, but I think it not unlikely.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again from Broadley, just arrived at Cairo:\r\n\r\n     _Broadley to Blunt, Oct. 20th_:\r\n\r\n     \"Borelli Bey, the Government prosecutor, admitted frankly that the\r\n     Egyptian Government had no law or procedure to go by, but suggested\r\n     we should agree as to a procedure. He admitted the members of the\r\n     Court were dummies and incompetent. He hoped I should smooth the\r\n     Sultan and let down Tewfik as _doucement_ as possible.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Napier to Blunt, Oct. 20th_:\r\n\r\n     \"I think now we can guarantee a clean breast of the whole facts. It\r\n     is as much as the Khedive's throne is worth to allow the trial to\r\n     proceed.\"\r\n\r\nThe chief danger we had to face was a desire, not yet extinct at the\r\nForeign Office, still by hook or crook to establish some criminal charge\r\nagainst Arabi which should justify his death. Chenery writes to me 21st\r\nOctober: \"Among important people there is a strong feeling against him\r\n[Arabi] on the alleged ground that he was concerned with, or connived\r\nat, the massacre in Alexandria. The matter will almost certainly come up\r\nat the trial.\" This danger, however, did not at Cairo seem a pressing\r\none, and certainly it was one that the prosecution was least likely to\r\ntouch, the Khedive himself being there the culprit. Nothing is more\r\nnoticeable in the interrogatories than the pains taken by the members of\r\nthe Court to avoid questions tending in that direction and the absence\r\non that point of all evidence which could incriminate any one. It was\r\none, however, of great political importance to our Government that it\r\nshould be proved against Arabi, for on it they had based the whole of\r\ntheir wilful insistence in forcing on a conflict, and without it their\r\n_moral_ excuse for intervention fell flatly to the ground. The same\r\nmight be said in regard to another absurd plea, insisted upon personally\r\nby Gladstone, that there had been an abuse of the white flag during the\r\nevacuation of Alexandria, a supposition which he had caught hold of in\r\none of his speeches and made a special crime of, though in truth\r\nwithdrawal of troops while a white flag is flying is permitted according\r\nto all the usages of war. Otherwise the coast seemed clear enough of\r\ndanger, for it was evident that the British public would no longer allow\r\nour Government to sanction Arabi's death for mere political reasons.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile at Cairo things were going prosperously. On the 22nd Broadley\r\nand Napier were admitted to Arabi's cell and speedily found in what he\r\ncould tell them the groundwork of a strong defence. Arabi's attitude in\r\nprison was a perfectly dignified one, for whatever may have been his\r\nlack of physical courage, he had moral courage to a high degree, and his\r\ndemeanour contrasted favourably with that of the large majority of those\r\nwho had been arrested with him and did not fail to impress all that saw\r\nhim. Without the smallest hesitation he wrote down in the next few days\r\na general history of the whole of the political affairs in which he had\r\nbeen mixed, and in form which was frank and convincing. No less\r\noutspoken was he in denouncing the ill-treatment he had received since\r\nhe had been transferred to his present prison from those scoundrels, the\r\nKhedive's eunuchs, who had been sent at night by their master to assault\r\nand insult him. Not a few of the prisoners had been thus shamefully\r\ntreated; yet by a singular lack of moral courage the greater number\r\ndared not put into plain words a crime personally implicating the\r\ncowardly tyrant who had been replaced as master over them. Nothing is\r\nmore lamentable in the depositions than the slavish attitude assumed by\r\nnearly all the deponents towards the Khedive's person, hated as he had\r\nbeen by them and despised not a month before. A more important event\r\nstill was the recovery from their concealment of Arabi's most important\r\npapers, which had been hidden in his house and which he now directed\r\nshould be sought out and placed in Broadley's hands. It was with great\r\ndifficulty that his son and wife in their terror could be brought to\r\nallow the search--for they, too, had been \"visited\" by the Khedive's\r\nservants--but at last the precious documents were secured and brought to\r\nBroadley by Arabi's servant already mentioned, Mohammed Sid Ahmed. They\r\nproved of supreme value--including as they did the letters written by\r\norder of the Sultan to Arabi and others of a like compromising kind. The\r\nnews of the discovery struck panic into the Palace and there seemed\r\nevery chance that the trial would be abandoned.\r\n\r\nNapier writing to me October 30th says: \"The fact is I believe we are\r\nmasters now, and that the Khedive and his crew would be glad to sneak\r\nout of the trial with as little delay as possible. The fidelity of\r\nArabi's servant and the constancy of his wife enabled us to recover all\r\nhis papers but one. They are now in a safe deposited in Beaman's room at\r\nthe Consulate.... The Government cannot face our defence. They will\r\noffer a compromise, banishment with all property reserved. What better\r\ncould be got?... This question will probably soon have to be\r\nconsidered.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be understood that the changed aspect of affairs at Cairo found\r\nits echo, and more than its echo, in the London Press. Cairo was full of\r\nnewspaper correspondents, and Broadley, who was a past master in the\r\narts of journalism, soon had them mostly on his side. His hospitality\r\n(at my expense) was lavish, and the \"chicken and champagne\" were not\r\nspared. Malet and Colvin, supreme in old days, were now quite unable to\r\nstem the torrent of news, and revelation followed revelation all\r\ndestructive of the theory they had imposed on the Government, that Arabi\r\nand the army had been alone in opposing the English demands and that the\r\nNational movement had been less than a universal one. Colvin was now\r\nbecome discredited at the Foreign Office as a false guide, and Malet's\r\nincapacity was at last fully recognized. Lord Granville, furious at our\r\nsuccess, and seeing the political situation in Egypt drifting into a\r\nhopeless muddle, did what was probably his wisest course in submitting\r\nthe whole matter to Lord Dufferin for a settlement. I had early notice\r\nfrom Button of this new move and that Dufferin's first business on\r\narriving at Cairo would be to bring about a compromise of the trial. My\r\nletter of instructions to Broadley in view of the situation thus created\r\nis worth inserting here:\r\n\r\n     _Blunt to Broadley, Nov. 2, 1882._\r\n\r\n     \"I wish to state over again my ideas and hopes in undertaking\r\n     Arabi's defence and that of his companions, which if they are\r\n     realized will repay me for the cost even though larger than I had\r\n     originally thought probable. Of course the main object was to save\r\n     the prisoners' lives, and that I think we may consider already\r\n     accomplished, for public opinion has declared itself in England,\r\n     and, the preliminary investigation having so entirely failed in the\r\n     matter of the June riots and the burning of Alexandria, no evidence\r\n     that now could be produced and no verdict given by the judges could\r\n     any longer place them in jeopardy. Since your arrival, however, and\r\n     through your skill and good fortune, a flush of trumps has come\r\n     into our hands. Instead of Arabi's papers being locked up in the\r\n     Foreign Office they are in our possession, and, as you tell me\r\n     to-day, our defence is perfect while we hold such a commanding\r\n     position over the enemy that we can fairly dictate them terms. We\r\n     cannot, therefore, be content with anything less than an honourable\r\n     acquittal or the abandonment of the trial. At present the latter\r\n     seems the most probable. Lord Dufferin has been ordered to Egypt;\r\n     the Premier yesterday threw out a feeler for a compromise, and from\r\n     everything I hear proposals will shortly be made for some\r\n     arrangement of the affair by which the scandal and discredit of an\r\n     exposure will be avoided. It depends, therefore, entirely on us to\r\n     save not only Arabi's life but his honour and his freedom and also\r\n     I believe the lives and freedom of all the political prisoners\r\n     inculpated with him.\r\n\r\n     \"I believe a strong attempt will be made by Lord Dufferin to get\r\n     Arabi to agree to a detention in the Andaman Islands, or some part\r\n     of the British Empire where he would remain a political prisoner\r\n     treated with kindness but not suffered to be at large. I believe\r\n     also he will endeavour to get from him a cession of his papers.\r\n     Neither of these attempts must be allowed to succeed, and all\r\n     proposals including them must be rejected. It is no business of\r\n     ours to save the Sultan's or the Khedive's honour nor to save Lord\r\n     Granville from embarrassment, and I shall consider our failure a\r\n     great one if we do not get far more. I think Arabi should, in the\r\n     first place, state that he demands a trial in order to clear his\r\n     honour, and especially to demonstrate the innocence of those who\r\n     acted with him during the war, viz., the whole nation, or, if not\r\n     brought to trial, that the charges against them should be withdrawn\r\n     as well as against himself. There should, in fact, be a general\r\n     amnesty, also he should retain his papers, though probably he might\r\n     give an understanding that they should not be published for a term\r\n     of years. We cannot, under the circumstances, object absolutely to\r\n     exile, because I suppose it would be argued the Khedive could exile\r\n     him by decree, but even this I should make a matter of favour,\r\n     because the Constitution of February, 1882 (which I hope you have\r\n     closely studied, and which is a most valuable document from the\r\n     fact of its having been confirmed by the Sultan as well as granted\r\n     by the Khedive) forbids such exiling. Still the point would have to\r\n     be conceded. We should, however, refuse anything like imprisonment.\r\n     The Khedive might exile him from Egypt, and the Sultan from the\r\n     Ottoman Empire, but neither would have a right to fix the place or\r\n     nature of his abode beyond them.\r\n\r\n     \"Nor could the English Government, having handed Arabi to the\r\n     Khedive for trial, let him be taken back untried to be dealt with\r\n     as a criminal by England. The English Government has recognized\r\n     this by refusing so to take him back. Still less could it imprison\r\n     him if so taken without trial. It is, therefore, clear that unless\r\n     tried and convicted he must leave Egypt a free man. Nor can he\r\n     legally be deprived in Egypt of his rank and pay. But I should\r\n     suppose that he will agree to retiring with military rank only, and\r\n     a small maintenance to save him from actual poverty and the\r\n     necessity of working with his hands. I think these terms would be\r\n     dignified, and they are terms we can insist upon. Otherwise I urge\r\n     the necessity of a defence tooth and nail, and I sincerely trust\r\n     that you will not listen to any proposal which may be made of a\r\n     _pro formâ_ trial and letting the Khedive down _doucement_, as\r\n     Borelli proposed. There should either be a real honest exposure of\r\n     _all_ the facts, or an honourable withdrawal of _all_ the charges.\r\n     I trust in you to co-operate with me fully in obtaining this\r\n     result, without regard for the feelings of Consuls or Ambassadors\r\n     or Viceroys. They are nothing to us, and our client's honour and\r\n     cause are everything. Your diplomatic skill is, I have no doubt, a\r\n     match for Lord Dufferin's, and it will be a great game to win. You\r\n     have made Malet do what you wanted, and so you will make Dufferin\r\n     do. If you achieve this we will not talk more about the fee. I\r\n     enclose a letter of introduction to Lord Dufferin.\"\r\n\r\nThe following from Mr. Beaman, Malet's official interpreter, and a\r\nwitness of unimpeachable authority, is of the highest historical\r\nimportance. Beaman had been in charge of the Agency at Cairo during the\r\nlast weeks before the bombardment, and being a good Arabic scholar knew\r\nmore of the true state of affairs than any one employed there. He had\r\nbeen appointed a few days before the date of his letter to superintend,\r\non Malet's part, the trial:\r\n\r\n     _Beaman to Blunt, Cairo, Nov. 6, 1882._\r\n\r\n     \"... This is our last day before the adjournment.... The Palace\r\n     people here are in a great stew at the advent of Lord Dufferin, who\r\n     arrives to-morrow. Broadley's arrival has been an agony to them,\r\n     but this is the last blow. I believe Dufferin is a man who will\r\n     quickly see through our friend Tewfik, and as I hear that his ears\r\n     are open to everybody the temporary Embassy will be better\r\n     informed, I expect, than the Agency has ever been. I had a great\r\n     deal of intercourse with natives before the bombardment of all\r\n     classes and parties, and knew the whole of the game from the four\r\n     sides, English, Turkish, Arabi, and Tewfik. They were each quite\r\n     distinct. As I could not have given my authorities, and as people\r\n     would not have accepted my word for things I could have told, I\r\n     kept my information for myself, but I have given some good hints to\r\n     Sir Charles Wilson, who now has a fairer idea of the Egyptian\r\n     question than any of our officials here. He is an extremely\r\n     cautious man, with a great share of shrewdness and true judgment\r\n     which he does not allow to be warped. Through him I have been able\r\n     to get facts to Malet which I should never have told Malet himself.\r\n     I think now that Malet has quite lost any respect he could ever\r\n     have had for the Khedive. Throughout our proceedings he has acted\r\n     with the greatest fairness to us, although dead against his own\r\n     interests.... You know how deeply he was pledged to the Khedive,\r\n     and it is quite bitter enough a cup to him to see his idol come\r\n     down from the card house which is breaking up.... I think the\r\n     Ibrahim Agha business alone is quite enough to show the Khedive in\r\n     his true colours. I heard the whole story direct from the Palace,\r\n     how the _titunji_, the Khedive's pipe bearer, had kissed the\r\n     Khedive's hand, and asked permission to spit in the faces of the\r\n     prisoners, and it was on this that Sir Charles Wilson made inquiry\r\n     and found it all true. Nevertheless, because it was evident that\r\n     the Khedive had a very dirty piece of linen to be washed in the\r\n     business, it was left alone. I suggested when all the witnesses\r\n     swore falsely that the oath of triple divorce should be\r\n     administered to them, and Sir Charles Wilson was in favour of it\r\n     too, but it was hushed up. His Highness's own family now no longer\r\n     pretend to deny it among themselves. And this is the man for whom\r\n     we came to Egypt.[32]\r\n\r\n     \"If I was not bound by my position here not to advise Broadley, I\r\n     could give him hints enough for his cross-examination to turn out\r\n     the Khedive to-morrow. I hope it will come out nevertheless. The\r\n     first man to be got rid of is Riaz. He is playing the very devil\r\n     through Egypt. The other day he said: 'The Egyptians are serpents\r\n     and the way to prevent serpents from propagating is to crush them\r\n     under foot. So will I crush the Egyptians.' And he is doing it.\"\r\n\r\nMatters stood thus in the first week of November, the date of Lord\r\nDufferin's arrival at Cairo. It was a fortunate circumstance for us who\r\nwere defending the cause of justice in England that Parliament that year\r\nhappened to be holding an autumn session. It brought to our aid\r\nin the House of Commons several Members of first rate fighting\r\nvalue--Churchill, Wolff, Gorst, Lawson, Labouchere, besides Robert\r\nBourke, Lord John Manners, W. J. Evelyn, and the present Lord Wemyss, of\r\nthe regular Tory opposition, with two or three Irish Members. Percy\r\nWyndham, to his credit, was the only Tory who had voted with the\r\nminority of twenty-one against the war.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[29] One of the matters principally laid to my charge was due to a\r\nReuter's telegram announcing that my country house near Cairo had been\r\nbroken open by Arabi's order, and that seventeen cases of firearms had\r\nbeen found in it. The foundation of this story was as follows: In 1881,\r\nwhen I was on my way, as I intended, to Arabia, I had brought with me\r\nsome Winchester rifles and revolvers for the journey, amounting to\r\nseventeen rifles in all, as well as a small brass cannon of the kind\r\nused on yachts, as a present, if I could find a way to send it to him,\r\nto Ibn Rashid at Haïl. These were still stored in my house, and some one\r\nhaving announced the fact to the provincial authorities, they had taken\r\npossession of them, and removed them to the Cairo citadel. In the\r\nconfusion after the war I could gain no intelligence of what had become\r\nof my property except the story which was afloat in London that my brass\r\ncannon had been taken there as a trophy of war, and was forming an\r\nornament at the Admiralty. It was not till some ten years afterwards\r\nthat having lunched one day with my cousin, Colonel Wyndham, at the\r\ncitadel at Cairo, he took me afterwards to visit the arsenal, where I\r\nsoon recognized my cannon and other property intact. As the box\r\ncontaining the rifles had my name on it, no difficulty was made in\r\nrestoring all to me.\r\n\r\n[30] Telegram from Moberly Bell.\r\n\r\n[31] I have been recently asked to explain that the true reason why the\r\n\"Times\" so strongly supported us in our attempt at this critical\r\njuncture to obtain for Arabi a fair trial was the Machiavellian one of\r\nforcing the British Government to undertake responsibilities which would\r\nentail their assumption of full authority in Egypt. I heard, however,\r\nnothing of this at the time, and I prefer still to believe that it was a\r\ngenerous impulse more worthy of the \"Times's\" better tradition and of\r\nChenery's excellent heart.\r\n\r\n[32] The fact of Tewfik's having sent his eunuchs to insult the\r\nNationalist leaders in prison is attested by Sheykh Mohammed Abdu, who\r\nwas among the earliest arrested, and was himself one of its victims. He\r\nrecorded his prison experience in a declaration submitted to Sir Charles\r\nWilson 29th October, but which is absent from the Blue Books.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nDUFFERIN'S MISSION\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Dufferin's arrival at Cairo on the 6th November placed matters\r\nthere on an entirely new footing. Up to that point Riaz Pasha and the\r\nrest of the Khedive's Ministers had been doing pretty much as they\r\nliked, subject only to Malet's weak supervision. But Dufferin was a man\r\nof another mould, and soon showed the Khedive that his position while in\r\nEgypt was to be that of master, not adviser. He paid little attention to\r\nhis tales, and not much, I believe, to Malet's, but opened the doors of\r\nhis Embassy to every one who could give information. Mackenzie Wallace,\r\nhis chief assistant, in a very few days acquired a good general\r\nknowledge of what had been going on in Egypt during the last two years,\r\nand his book about it gives more of the truth than any other yet\r\npublished in English. Dufferin, though an idle man, was a rapid worker,\r\nand where he had something serious to do, knew how easiest to do it.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, for the first fortnight after Dufferin's arrival, and\r\nuntil he had quite assured himself of his ground, the prosecution of\r\nArabi was allowed to work on in its own casual way, swayed by the\r\nKhedive's ever shifting impulses of a desire to conceal the truth on the\r\none hand, and an unwillingness on the other to let go his prey. These\r\nwill be best recorded by simply reproducing the letters and telegrams\r\nwhich now passed almost daily between me in London and Messrs. Broadley\r\nand Napier at Cairo, as will the successive steps by which a compromise\r\nof the trial was eventually come to.\r\n\r\n     _Broadley to Blunt, November 6th (in answer to his letter of\r\n     November 2nd)_:\r\n\r\n     \"I entirely concur in all you say, and shall exercise the greatest\r\n     prudence. I am completing a perfect case for defence, showing:\r\n\r\n     \"(1) Purity, honesty of Arabi's inspirations.\r\n\r\n     \"(2) Perfect concurrence of Tewfik till July 12.\r\n\r\n     \"(3) Perfect concurrence of the Sultan throughout.\r\n\r\n     \"(4) Universality of the movement.\r\n\r\n     \"(5) Wholly illegal constitution of the Court Martial.\r\n\r\n     \"(6) Absurdity of the white flag (on which subject Napier has\r\n     secured A 1 deposition from Lambton).\r\n\r\n     \"(7) Abnormal humanitarian character of Arabi.\r\n\r\n     \"(8) Abnormal iniquity of all proceedings until our arrival.\r\n\r\n     \"(9) Torture of prisoners.\r\n\r\n     \"(10) Letters from Tewfik to Constantinople against England.\r\n\r\n     \"(11) Systematic falsification of the 'Moniteur.'\r\n\r\n     \"Shall demand release of all the accused. _Keep this private._\r\n\r\n     \"Now all I fear is the enormous expense of a protracted trial of\r\n     eight or nine months.

I have turned\r\n     public opinion here quite in favour of Arabi. We are obliged to\r\n     employ a dozen interpreters at salaries varying from £1 to £2\r\n     10_s._ a week.... My absence from Tunis means utter loss of _all_\r\n     there. All my pending cases have been given up, including some of\r\n     great magnitude.

In the first place since we were not permitted to be\r\n     present at the examination of the witnesses, it is necessary for us\r\n     not only to have the whole of the evidence copied, but also to\r\n     submit the whole of it to each of the prisoners for his observation\r\n     and consideration.... There are 136 witnesses who will be brought\r\n     against us. Besides these, 125 prisoners have been interrogated,\r\n     and their answers will be used against each other. Then anybody who\r\n     pleases seems to have been allowed to write letters to the Court,\r\n     among others, H. H. the Khedive and, I believe, the Ministers, or\r\n     some of them.... Not one word of the evidence is on oath, and most\r\n     of it consists of hearsay and opinion.... 'In your opinion is Arabi\r\n     a rebel?' 'I don't know.' 'You bad, wicked man, why don't you\r\n     know?' 'I can't tell why I don't know.' 'Then think it over, and\r\n     to-morrow bring a written statement of what you do know.' To-morrow\r\n     the wretch arrives with a written statement that the prisoner in\r\n     question is a rebel and incendiary.\r\n\r\n     \"Then again the translations afforded us are not correct\r\n     translations from the originals, and the originals are not true\r\n     records of the evidence of the witnesses themselves....\r\n\r\n     \"Thank Heaven they have imprisoned a man named Rifaat. [He had been\r\n     Secretary to the Government and Director of the Press.] They could\r\n     not have done anything so destructive to their own case. Not only\r\n     does he know French well, but he has good literary ability, and a\r\n     very fair knowledge of all these tortuous and involved intrigues\r\n     rolled up one within another the untanglement of which is a\r\n     business enough to make the head reel. How if it were to appear\r\n     that the Abdin, Sept. 9, demonstration had been got up by the\r\n     Khedive as the best means of ridding him of the disagreeable\r\n     tutelage of Riaz and his Ministry! And how if the dark deeds of\r\n     June 11 were plotted in the Palace to force the English and French\r\n     to crush the now uncontrolled and uncontrollable National movement!\r\n\r\n     \"I have been in hopes all along that the Government would not face\r\n     the trial, and that they would find some means to put an end to the\r\n     scandal that must ensue. But I begin to think that that will not be\r\n     so. Many people in high places are prompted by motives of revenge,\r\n     and still hope to wreak it upon their enemies. Others hope that by\r\n     the unworthy devices of the Court a fair trial may yet be\r\n     prevented. And I have no doubt they will in a great measure\r\n     succeed. Again, perhaps it is the policy of the English Cabinet to\r\n     insist upon the matter being threshed out, so as to give them time\r\n     to meet the storm, and an opportunity of throwing over the Turks\r\n     and perhaps Tewfik. If the trial is to go on I cannot tell what the\r\n     expense will be, but I fear it will be very great.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Napier to Lady Anne Blunt, November 16th_:\r\n\r\n     \"Lord Dufferin began at once by lending us his assistance. Broadley\r\n     and I called a day or two after his arrival. Broadley made a very\r\n     masterly statement which put him in possession of the whole of our\r\n     numerous causes of complaint. He has also been given copies of our\r\n     formal protests, and I believe will indirectly assist us to defeat\r\n     the Court of imbeciles with whom we have to deal.... The\r\n     correspondents, with the exception of Bell, are all, I believe,\r\n     favourable. The 'Daily News' especially. Wallace of the 'Times' has\r\n     just arrived, and I believe his influence will go far to counteract\r\n     Bell's extraordinary correspondence. Bell will particularly be\r\n     called to account for his 'Arabi's head-in-a-charger' policy. I\r\n     think he seems a little uncomfortable on the prospect of being\r\n     examined on his telegrams in Court.\"\r\n\r\nMackenzie Wallace, here alluded to, arrived with Dufferin from\r\nConstantinople, where he was \"Times\" correspondent, and afterwards\r\nbecame Dufferin's private secretary when His Lordship went to India as\r\nViceroy. He was an able man, and acted while in Egypt entirely in\r\nconcert with Dufferin, and has written the only English narrative of the\r\nevents of 1882 which has any historical value.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is in connection with the final attempt made by the\r\nprosecution to get evidence against Arabi on a point which might be\r\ntreated as a capital one, namely, the arrest of Suliman Sami, who had\r\nbeen in command of the Egyptian rear-guard at the evacuation of\r\nAlexandria, and who, having been subjected to the usual intimidation\r\ntreatment in prison, was now said to be ready to give evidence that\r\nArabi had ordered him to burn the city. It was this sudden desperate\r\nattempt to obtain a capital verdict that brought matters to a crisis at\r\nCairo, and resulted, as we shall see, in the compromise effected by\r\nDufferin of the trial.\r\n\r\n     _Broadley to Blunt, November 17th_:\r\n\r\n     \"An attempt has been made to force Suliman Bey to implicate Arabi.\r\n     It has been done so clumsily that Suliman has contradicted every\r\n     other witness called to prove the same thing, _but_ I believe it\r\n     was done at a midnight or secret sitting when Wilson was absent....\r\n     Try and make your peace with the Foreign Office, Dufferin is\r\n     square, and we could get a lot by soft words.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Beaman to Blunt, November 17th_:\r\n\r\n     \"I just write a line ... to say that things are going on very well.\r\n     The evidence of Suliman Sami, which seems to have rejoiced the\r\n     prosecution, is not worth a straw, having been palpably invented\r\n     for the occasion, and not supported by any of the preceding\r\n     testimony. The only question seems to be if the prisoners will get\r\n     off without a trial, or if they will have a chance of being fairly\r\n     heard in their own defence. I am convinced that the Government here\r\n     is using every effort to quash the proceedings, as the facts that\r\n     would come out in cross-examination would be compromising to every\r\n     man almost now in power, and would lay bare some very unpleasant\r\n     facts about the Khedive. For this last reason it is just possible\r\n     that our Government may feel inclined to propose terms to Arabi, as\r\n     it will be a rough _exposé_ if the trial proves the biggest scamp\r\n     in Egypt is the man whom we brought an army here to uphold.\r\n     Personally I have very little doubt that the Khedive and Omar\r\n     Loutfi arranged the Alexandrian massacre in order to aim a blow at\r\n     Arabi, who had just declared himself responsible for public safety.\r\n     I hold proofs which carry me half way to conviction, but the time\r\n     has not yet come to produce them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Broadley to Blunt. Telegram. November 18th_:\r\n\r\n     \"Believe excellent compromise possible. Do not attack the Foreign\r\n     Office. Absolute secrecy necessary.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Broadley to Blunt. Telegram. November 20th_:\r\n\r\n     \"London parleys Dufferin.

I have had a long interview [with] Dufferin\r\n     to-day. He is most friendly. The dossier is before us. _Nothing_\r\n     presents difficulties but the burning of Alexandria. As regards\r\n     this I believe the proof will fail as to Araby's orders, but many\r\n     ugly facts remain, viz.: no efforts to stop conflagration and\r\n     loot.

November 27th_:\r\n\r\n     \"Cairo, _Nov. 27th, 1882_.\r\n\r\n     \"DEAR BLUNT,\r\n\r\n     \"It is much to be regretted that the Post Office people have found\r\n     out our correspondence, for they have, to my knowledge, opened your\r\n     last letter to me registered and received last Friday. It contained\r\n     the Borelli charges returned, and a short note from you. I do not\r\n     think anything was abstracted. I shall send this by ordinary post\r\n     under cover to H. H. Asquith, Temple, E. C., in the hope that it\r\n     may escape their vigilance. I, of course, protested at once, but\r\n     do not suppose that they will mend their ways. I also greatly\r\n     regret that I have no time to keep copies of my own letters to you\r\n     for reference. You must not be surprised therefore if you sometimes\r\n     meet with repetition. I cannot tell you of all the tricks they have\r\n     played upon us, as they would fill volumes. The letter had been\r\n     obviously opened by being slit across above the seal, and gummed up\r\n     again. It had been cleverly done, and I might not have discovered\r\n     it but for the fact that the gum used was not quite set. It\r\n     therefore opened along the line of the slit, and I at once found\r\n     the gum where no gum should have been. I will send you a short note\r\n     by the direct mail so that you shall not be surprised at the delay\r\n     in the delivery of this. Although we have been hard at work since\r\n     last mail, I do not know that anything of much importance has\r\n     occurred except that we have been admitted to the defence of Mahmud\r\n     Sami, with whom we have had several long conferences. Toulba is\r\n     ill, suffering from nervous excitement, I think, and asthma. I do\r\n     not know whether he will die, but I have done everything in my\r\n     power to get him proper medical assistance, a change of room, a\r\n     companion, and, if possible, a raised bed.\r\n\r\n     \"The last evidence in the question of the burning of Alexandria has\r\n     not been communicated to us except through the medium of the\r\n     Egyptian Gazette, which may or may not be correct. It is not\r\n     formidable in itself, but it is quite sufficient to give colour to\r\n     a finding against the prisoner on that charge. It becomes,\r\n     therefore, of the most vital importance to consider whether there\r\n     is no way out other than through the portals of the court martial.\r\n     There is no doubt that we could discredit the evidence, and even\r\n     smash it up in cross-examination. And besides, on the other charges\r\n     of Rebellion and Massacre of June 11th I feel sure we could make it\r\n     hot for the prosecution, but there is an opinion in a very high\r\n     quarter that there is a strong determination to execute if the\r\n     Court should find guilty. Assume, therefore, that the Court Martial\r\n     find the prisoner (for I am only speaking of the chief now) guilty,\r\n     it will be for the English Government to reverse the sentence. I am\r\n     of opinion that it would be dangerous to trust them to carefully\r\n     examine the evidence and the manner in which it has been obtained.\r\n     I think it possible that that matter would be hastily disposed of\r\n     in the Foreign Office, and that they might leave the prisoner to\r\n     the Court, declaring that everything had been done to secure a\r\n     fair trial, and that they could not interfere with a verdict\r\n     deliberately arrived at after the fullest opportunity given to the\r\n     defence. And besides, it is more than probable that they would\r\n     allow _some_ sentence to pass--any sentence suffered here would be\r\n     most dangerous to the prisoner. After careful consideration I dare\r\n     not advise the prisoner to trust to the trial if he have an\r\n     alternative. If terms of banishment are offered, with proper\r\n     safeguards and provision for maintenance, I shall be strongly in\r\n     favour of accepting them. To sum up: If found guilty by the Court,\r\n     some punishment, perhaps death, certainly a serious one, will be\r\n     inflicted: If acquitted, either voluntary banishment without means,\r\n     or remaining in the country at the mercy of the Government here. If\r\n     he leaves the country under a compromise all charges except that of\r\n     rebellion would have to be withdrawn, and provision for his life in\r\n     a suitable place would have to be accorded. I have reason to\r\n     believe that the course of a compromise finds favour with all but\r\n     Riaz, and is also favourably regarded by Dufferin.\r\n\r\n     \"Give us your opinion, and believe me ever very sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n     \"MARK NAPIER.\r\n\r\n     \"P.

December 4th_:\r\n\r\n     \"Many thanks kind telegram.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be perceived by these telegrams that it was not without\r\nreluctance that I agreed to the compromise proposed by Dufferin. We had\r\nat the moment the full tide of English opinion with us, and I knew that\r\nthe Foreign Office could not do otherwise than agree to almost any terms\r\nwe chose to impose, and I was most unwilling that the charge of\r\nrebellion should be admitted by us. At the same time it was not possible\r\nfor me in the face of Broadley's, and especially Napier's, telegrams to\r\nwithhold my assent. The responsibility was too great. I had also the\r\nquestion of costs to consider. It is true that a public subscription\r\nhad been opened which had brought us valuable names. But the actual sums\r\nsubscribed did not yet amount to £200, while Broadley's bill was running\r\nalready to £3,000. A continuation for another month of the trial would\r\nhave meant for me a larger expenditure than I was prepared to face in a\r\npolitical quarrel which was not quite my own. I therefore took counsel\r\nwith De la Warr, and especially with Robert Bourke, of whom I have\r\nalready spoken, and who warned me how frail a thing public opinion was\r\nto rely on, and advised me strongly to consent. I remember walking up\r\nand down with him in Montagu Square, where he lived, in indecision for\r\nhalf an hour before I was finally convinced and yielded. I consequently\r\nsent the telegram of approval, and eventually, after much argument, we\r\nsucceeded in obtaining as Arabi's place of exile the Island of Ceylon,\r\nthe traditional place of exile of our father Adam when driven out of\r\nParadise. No more honourable one could possibly have been fixed upon.\r\n\r\nThe exact terms of the arrangement come to with Dufferin were\r\nunfortunately not committed by him to writing, an oversight on\r\nBroadley's part, who ought to have insisted on this and thus saved us\r\nmuch after trouble and misunderstanding. The negligence allowed the\r\nEgyptian Government to inflict degradation of rank on the prisoners,\r\nwhich was certainly not in the spirit of Lord Dufferin's arrangement,\r\nthough, perhaps, legally following the _pro formâ_ sentence of death for\r\nrebellion. Room, too, was left for dispute as to what was the amount of\r\nthe allowance intended as compensation for the confiscations. Broadley\r\nseems to have exaggerated to his clients the promises on this head.\r\nPersonally I consider that they were not illiberally dealt with, as the\r\nproperty of most of them was insignificant, and they were allowed to\r\nretain property belonging to their wives. The only considerable sufferer\r\npecuniarily was Mahmud Pasha Sami, who had a large estate which he\r\nforfeited. As to Arabi, his sole worldly possessions, besides what\r\nfurniture was in his house at Cairo, a hired one, and some horses in his\r\nstable, consisted of the eight acres of good land he had inherited from\r\nhis father in his native village, to which he had at various time added\r\nparcels of uncultivated land on the desert edge, amounting to some six\r\nhundred acres, paid for out of his pay in prosperous days. These at the\r\ntime of the confiscation cannot have been worth much over £2,000 or\r\n£3,000, for barren land was then selling for only a few reals the acre,\r\nand he had not had time to reclaim or improve them.[33]\r\n\r\nA point, too, which was long disputed, but which is no longer of\r\nimportance, was whether the _paroles_ of the prisoners were given to the\r\nEgyptian or the English Governments. But with these matters I need not\r\ntrouble myself more than to say that the English Government, having\r\ngained its end of getting the rebellion admitted by us, and so a title\r\ngiven for their intervention in Egypt, gave little more help to the\r\ndefence of certain unfortunate minor prisoners who on various pretexts\r\nfound themselves excluded from the amnesty, and were subjected to all\r\nthe injustices of the Khedive's uncontrolled authority. These, however,\r\nbelong to a period beyond that of which I now propose to write, namely,\r\nthat of the permanent Occupation, and cannot be detailed in my present\r\nmemoir, which now, I think, has made clear at least my own part in the\r\nevents of the revolution to the last point where that part was personal.\r\n\r\nLooking back at my action in Egypt during that period, with its early\r\nsuccesses and its final failure to obtain for the National Government\r\nfair treatment at English hands, I cannot wholly regret the course I\r\ntook. I made, of course, many mistakes, and I feel that I am in\r\nconsiderable measure responsible for the determination the Nationalists\r\ncame to to risk their country's fortune on the die of battle. But I\r\nstill think their fate would have been a worse one if they had not\r\nfought, tamely surrendering to European pressure. They at least thus got\r\na hearing from the world at large, and if any attention since has been\r\npaid to fellah grievances it has been won wholly by Arabi's persistence,\r\nwhich I encouraged, in accepting the logic of their political principles\r\neven to the point of war. It obliged England to listen to their\r\ncomplaints and, if it could not prevent her from depriving them of their\r\npolitical liberty, it has forced her since to remedy most of their\r\nsecular material wrongs.\r\n\r\nWhat the future may bring to Egypt I know not. She has grown rich under\r\nEnglish tutelage, and though I do not consider riches synonymous with\r\nthe well being of a nation, they have been in Egypt of at least this\r\nvalue, that they have enabled the native Nile population so far to hold\r\nits own against foreign intrusion as owner of the soil. While this is,\r\nthe Nation will remain alive, and the day may yet come for the fellah\r\nrace when self-government will be restored to them, and the armed\r\nstruggle of 1882 will appear to them in its true light as the beginning\r\nof their national life, and one, as such, glorious in their annals. To\r\nthat day of final emancipation I still pin my hopes, though it is not\r\nlikely I shall live to see it.[34]\r\n\r\nIf my life is prolonged for a few years, it is my intention to continue\r\nthe writing of my memoirs, and this will include much that is of\r\nimportance to Egypt, though nothing of such high historical value as the\r\nrecital already made. The present volume may well stand by itself, and\r\nso with regret I leave it. I should have wished to include in it an\r\naccount of Lord Dufferin's mission of reconstruction, and the weak\r\nefforts made by Gladstone to undo the wrong he had inflicted on the\r\ncause of liberty, and on his own reputation as a man of good. But this\r\nwould lead me too far, and I prefer to end my actual narrative at the\r\npoint where we have now arrived, the close of the eventful year, 1882.\r\nOn one of the last days of it I received a second characteristic letter\r\nfrom Gordon in which, speaking of the war and the suppression of liberty\r\nin Egypt, he quotes the following appropriate verse:\r\n\r\n     \"When thou seest the violent oppression of the poor, or the\r\n     subversion of justice, marvel not at it, for the Higher than the\r\n     Highest regardeth it.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[33] A claim made recently in his name for a large indemnity in regard\r\nto these lands, and embodied in a petition addressed to our King Edward,\r\nis an entire illusion on Arabi's part, and marks the fact, otherwise\r\nvery apparent to those who know him, that he has fallen into a condition\r\nof senile decay for which there is no remedy.\r\n\r\nThe worst oversight was that the promised general amnesty was not\r\nexactly defined. Hence the later prosecutions on so-called \"criminal\"\r\ncharges.\r\n\r\n[34] This was written in 1904.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDICES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I\r\n\r\nARABI'S ACCOUNT OF HIS LIFE AND OF THE EVENTS OF 1881-1882, AS TOLD TO\r\nME, WILFRID SCAWEN BLUNT, IN ARABIC YESTERDAY, MARCH 16TH, 1903, AT\r\nSHEYKH OBEYD\r\n\r\n\r\nI was born in the year 1840 at Horiyeh, near Zagazig, in the Sherkieh.\r\nMy father was Sheykh of the village, and owned eight and a half feddans\r\nof land, which I inherited from him and gradually increased by savings\r\nout of my pay, which at one time was as much as £250 a month, till it\r\namounted to 570 feddans, and that was the amount confiscated at the time\r\nof my trial. I bought the land cheaply in those days for a few pounds a\r\nfeddan which is worth a great deal now, especially as it was in a poor\r\nstate (_wahash_) when I bought it and now is in good cultivation. But\r\nnone of it was given me by Saïd Pasha or any one, and the acreage I\r\ninherited was only eight and a half. I invested all the money I could\r\nsave in land, and had no other invested money or movable property except\r\na little furniture and some horses and such like, which may have been\r\nworth £1,000.\r\n\r\nAs a boy I studied for two years at the Azhar, but was taken for a\r\nsoldier when I was only fourteen, as I was a tall well grown lad and\r\nSaïd Pasha wanted to have as many as possible of the sons of the village\r\nSheykhs, and train them to be officers. I was made to go through an\r\nexamination, and what I had learned at the Azhar served me well, and I\r\nwas made a _boulok-amin_, clerk, instead of serving in the ranks, at\r\nsixty piastres a month. I did not, however, like this, as I thought I\r\nshould never rise to any high position, and I wished to be a personage\r\nlike the Mudir of our province, so I petitioned Ibrahim Bey, who was my\r\nsuperior, to be put back into the ranks. Ibrahim Bey showed me that I\r\nshould lose by this as my pay would then be only fifty piastres, but I\r\ninsisted and so served. I was put soon after to another examination, out\r\nof which I came first, and they made me _chowish_, and then to a third\r\nand they made me lieutenant when I was only seventeen. Suliman Pasha el\r\nFranzawi was so pleased with me that he insisted with Saïd Pasha on\r\ngiving me promotion, and I became captain at eighteen, major at\r\nnineteen, and Lieutenant-Colonel, _Caimakam_, at twenty. Then Saïd Pasha\r\ntook me with him as A. D. C. when he went to Medina, about a year before\r\nhe died. That was in A. H. 1279 (1862?).\r\n\r\nSaïd Pasha's death was a great misfortune to me and to all, as he was\r\nfavourable to the children of the country. Ismaïl was quite otherwise.\r\nIn his time everything was put back into the hands of the Turks and\r\nCircassians, and the Egyptians in the army got no protection and no\r\npromotion. I went on serving as Caimakam for twelve years without much\r\nincident till war came with Abyssinia. I was not sent to the war with\r\nRussia, but when the war with Abyssinia broke out all available troops\r\nwere wanted, and the garrisons were withdrawn from the stations on the\r\nHaj Road, and I was sent to do this. I was sent quite alone without a\r\nsingle soldier or a single piastre and had to get there as best I could\r\non a camel. I went in this way to Nakhl and Akaba and Wej collecting the\r\ngarrisons and putting in Arabs to take charge of the forts there as\r\n_ghaffirs_. Then we crossed over the sea to Kosseir and so by Keneh to\r\nCairo. I was not paid a penny for this service or even my expenses. The\r\ncountry was in a fearful state of oppression, and it was then I began to\r\ninterest myself in politics to save my countrymen from ruin. I was sent\r\non to Massowa from Cairo and took part in the campaign of which Ratib\r\nPasha was commander-in-chief, with Loringe Pasha, the American, as Chief\r\nof the Staff. I was not present at the battle of Kora, being in charge\r\nof the transport service between Massowa and the army. It was a\r\ndisastrous battle, seven _ortas_ being completely destroyed. Loringe\r\nPasha was the officer mostly in fault. The Khedive's son, Hassan, was\r\nthere, but only as a boy, to learn soldiering. He was not in command nor\r\nis it true that he was taken prisoner by the Abyssinians.\r\n\r\nAfter this I thought much about politics. I remember to have seen Sheykh\r\nJemal-ed-Din, but not to speak to, but my former connection with the\r\nAzhar made me acquainted with several of his disciples. The most\r\ndistinguished of them were Sheykh Mohammed Abdu, and Sheykh Hassan el\r\nTowil. The first book that ever gave me ideas about political matters\r\nwas an Arabic translation of the \"Life of Bonaparte\" by Colonel Louis.\r\nThe book had been brought by Saïd Pasha with him to Medina, and its\r\naccount of the conquest of Egypt by 30,000 Frenchmen so angered him that\r\nhe threw the book on the ground, saying \"See how your countrymen let\r\nthemselves be beaten.\" And I took it up and read all that night, without\r\nsleeping, till the morning. Then I told Saïd Pasha that I had read it\r\nand that I saw that the French had been victorious because they were\r\nbetter drilled and organized, and that we could do as well in Egypt if\r\nwe tried.\r\n\r\nYou ask me about the affair of the riot against Nubar Pasha in the time\r\nof Ismaïl and whether I had a hand in it. I had none, for the reason\r\nthat I was away at Rashid (Rosetta) with my regiment. But the day before\r\nthe thing happened I was telegraphed for by the War Office with my\r\nfellow Caimakam, Mohammed Bey Nadi, to deal with the case of a number of\r\nsoldiers that had been disbanded by the new Ministers without their\r\narrears of pay or even bread to eat, and who were at Abbassiyeh. But I\r\nknew nothing of what was being arranged against Nubar. That was done by\r\norder of the Khedive, Ismaïl Pasha, through a servant of his, Shahin\r\nPasha, and his brother-in-law, Latif Eff. Selim, director of the\r\nmilitary college. These got up a demonstration of the students of the\r\ncollege, who went in a body to the Ministry of Finance. They were joined\r\non the way by some of the disbanded soldiers and officers, not many, but\r\nsome. At the Ministry they found Nubar getting into his carriage, and\r\nthey assaulted him, pulled his moustache, and boxed his ears. Then\r\nIsmaïl Pasha was sent for to quell the riot and he came with\r\nAbd-el-Kader Pasha and Ali Bey Fehmy, the colonel of his guard, whom he\r\nordered to fire on the students, but Ali Fehmy ordered his men to fire\r\nover their heads and nobody was hurt. Ali Fehmy was not with us at that\r\ntime. He was devoted to Ismaïl, having married a lady of the palace, but\r\nhe did not like to shed the blood of these young men.\r\n\r\nIsmaïl Pasha, to conceal his part in it and that of those who got up the\r\naffair, accused Nadi Bey and me and Ali Bey Roubi of being their leaders\r\nand we were brought before a _mejliss_ on which were Stone Pasha and\r\nHassan Pasha Afflatoun with Osman Rifki, afterwards Under-Secretary of\r\nWar, and others. I showed, however, that it was impossible we could be\r\nconcerned in it as we had only that very night arrived from Rosetta.\r\nNevertheless we were blamed and separated from our regiments, Nadi being\r\nsent to Mansura, Roubi to the Fayum, and I to Alexandria where I was\r\ngiven a nominal duty of acting as agent for the Sheykhs of Upper Egypt,\r\nwhose arrears of taxes in the shape of beans and other produce were to\r\nbe collected and sent to Alexandria in security for money advanced to\r\nIsmaïl by certain Jews of that place. But before we separated we had a\r\nmeeting at which I proposed that we should join together and depose\r\nIsmaïl Pasha. It would have been the best solution of the case, as the\r\nConsuls would have been glad to get rid of Ismaïl in any way, and it\r\nwould have saved after complications as well as the fifteen millions\r\nIsmaïl took away with him when he was deposed. But there was nobody as\r\nyet to take the lead, and my proposal, though approved, was not\r\nexecuted. The deposition of Ismaïl lifted a heavy load from our\r\nshoulders and all the world rejoiced, but it would have been better if\r\nwe had done it ourselves as we could then have got rid of the whole\r\nfamily of Mohammed Ali, who were none of them, except Saïd, fit to rule,\r\nand we could have proclaimed a republic. Sheykh Jemal-ed-Din proposed to\r\nMohammed Abdu to kill Ismaïl at the Kasr-el-Nil Bridge and Mohammed Abdu\r\napproved. Ismaïl collected the money of the Mudiriehs six months before\r\nhis deposition. Latif afterwards avowed his part in the affair. Latif\r\nwas put in prison but released on application of the freemasons to\r\nNubar.\r\n\r\nTewfik Pasha, when he succeeded Ismaïl, by his first act made public\r\npromise of a Constitution. You ask me whether he was sincere in this. He\r\nnever was sincere, but he was a man incredibly weak, who never could say\r\n\"no,\" and he was under the influence of his Minister, Sherif Pasha, who\r\nwas a sincere lover of free forms of government. Tewfik, in his father's\r\nreign, had amassed money, which was what he cared for most, by receiving\r\npresents from persons who had petitions to make, and who thought he\r\ncould forward their ends. He had no wish for a Constitution, but he\r\ncould not say \"no\" when Sherif pressed him. So he promised. Two months\r\nlater he fell under the stronger influence of the Consuls, who forbade\r\nhim to decree it. On this Sherif called the Ministers together, and they\r\nall gave him their words of honour that they would resign with him if he\r\nresigned. And so it happened. But some of them, notwithstanding their\r\npromise, joined Riaz Pasha when he became Prime Minister in Sherif's\r\nplace. In order to persuade them Riaz engaged that each Minister should\r\nbe supreme in his own department, and that they would not allow Tewfik\r\nto interfere in any way with the administration. Mahmud Sami joined him\r\nas Minister of the _Awkaf_, Ali Mubarak as Minister of Public Works, and\r\nOsman Pasha Rifki, a Turk of the old school, who hated the fellahin, was\r\nmade Minister of War. The new government was a tyrannical one. Hassan\r\nMoussa el Akkad, for signing a petition against the breaking of the\r\nMoukabala arrangement, was exiled to the White Nile, and Ahmed Fehmi for\r\nanother petition, and many other people were got rid of who incurred the\r\ndispleasure of the Ministers. Of all the Ministers the worst was Osman\r\nRifki.\r\n\r\nWe colonels were now once more with our regiments, and as native\r\nEgyptians subject to much oppression. On any pretext a fellah officer\r\nwould be arrested, and his place filled by a Circassian. It was the plan\r\nto weed the whole army of its native officers. I was especially in ill\r\nfavour because I had refused to allow my men to be taken from their\r\nmilitary duty and put to dig the Tewfikieh Canal, which it was the\r\npractice to make them do without extra pay. Plans were made to involve\r\nme in some street quarrel with the view to my assassination, but through\r\nthe love of my soldiers I always escaped. All officers who were not\r\nCircassians were in danger, and all were alarmed. It was thus that Ali\r\nFehmy, who was a fellah born, though through his wife connected with the\r\nCourt, came to join us, for he feared he, too, would be superseded. He\r\nwas Colonel of the 1st Regiment of Guards, and stationed at Abdin; I was\r\nat Abbassiyeh with the 3rd Regiment, and Abd-el-Aal Helmi was at Toura.\r\nAli Roubi commanded the cavalry.\r\n\r\nMatters came to a crisis in January, 1881. I had gone to spend the\r\nevening with Nejm ed Din Pasha, and there were at his house some pashas\r\ntalking over the changes Osman Rifki had in hand, and I learned from\r\nthem that it had been decided that I and Abd-el-Aal should be deprived\r\nof our commands, and our places given to officers of the Circassian\r\nclass. At the same moment a message arrived for me from my house to say\r\nthat Ali Fehmy had come there with Abd-el-Aal and was awaiting me. So I\r\nwent home and I found them there, and from them I learned the same evil\r\nnews. We therefore took council what was to be done. Abd-el-Aal proposed\r\nthat we should go in force to Osman Rifki's house and arrest or kill\r\nhim, but I said, \"No, let us petition first the Prime Minister, and\r\nthen, if he refuses, the Khedive.\" And they charged me to draw the\r\npetition up in form. And I did so, stating the case, and demanding the\r\ndismissal of Osman Rifki, and the raising of the army to 18,000 men, and\r\nthe decreeing of the promised Constitution. [N. B.--I think Arabi makes\r\na mistake here, confusing these last two demands with those made on the\r\n9th of September. But he insisted on it the three proposals were first\r\nmade in February, and made in writing then.] This we all three signed,\r\nthough knowing that our lives were at stake.\r\n\r\nThe following morning we went with our petition to the Minister of the\r\nInterior and asked to see Riaz. We were shown into an outer room and\r\nwaited while the Minister read it in an inner room. Presently he came\r\nout. \"Your petition,\" he said, \"is _muhlik_\" (a hanging matter). \"What\r\nis it you want? to change the Ministry? And what would you put in its\r\nplace? Whom do you propose to carry on the government?\" And I answered\r\nhim, \"_Ye saat le Basha_, is Egypt then a woman who has borne but eight\r\nsons and then been barren?\" By this I meant himself and the seven\r\nministers under him. He was angry at this, but in the end said he would\r\nsee into our affair, and so we left him. Immediately a council was\r\nassembled with the Khedive and all his Court, and Stone and Blitz also.\r\nAnd the Khedive proposed that we should be arrested and tried, but\r\nothers said, \"If these are put on trial, Osman Pasha also must be\r\ntried.\" Therefore Osman was left to deal with it alone. And the rest you\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nYou ask did the Khedive at that time know of our intention to petition.\r\nHe did not know that nor that Ali Fehmy came to us. But afterwards he\r\nknew. You ask did I know the Baron de Ring. I did not know him, nor any\r\none of the Consuls, but I heard that the French Consul had the most\r\ninfluence, and I wrote to him telling him what our position was, and\r\nbegging him to let the other Consuls know that there was no fear for\r\ntheir subjects. You ask if I knew Mahmud Sami. I did not know him yet.\r\nBut he was friends with my friend Ali Roubi, and I had heard a good\r\naccount of him as a lover of freedom. He was of a Circassian family, but\r\none that had been 600 years in Egypt.\r\n\r\nAs to the second demonstration of September 9th, we knew then that the\r\nKhedive was with us. He wished to rid himself of Riaz, who disregarded\r\nhis authority. I saw him but twice to speak to that summer, and never on\r\npolitics. His communication was through Ali Fehmy, who brought us word\r\nto the following effect: \"You three are soldiers. With me you make\r\nfour.\" You ask me whether he was sincere. He never was sincere. But he\r\nwished an excuse to dismiss Riaz. We therefore demanded next time the\r\ndismissal of Riaz, as well as the rest, knowing he would be pleased. On\r\nthe morning of the 9th September we sent word to the Khedive that we\r\nshould come to the _asr_ to Abdin to make demand of the fulfilment of\r\nhis promises. He came, and with him Cookson, and it was with Cookson\r\nthat I debated the various proposals made. He asked if we should be\r\ncontent with Haidar Pasha, but I said \"we want no relation of the\r\nKhedive.\" There were no written demands the second time, only a renewal\r\nof the three demands of the 1st February, the Chamber of Notables, the\r\nraising of the army to 18,000 men, according to the firmans, and the\r\ndismissal of Riaz. They agreed to all. The Khedive was delighted. I know\r\nnothing of Colvin having been there, or of any advice he gave to the\r\nKhedive. The only ones I saw were Cookson and Goldsmid. It was Cookson\r\nwho talked to me. If the Khedive had tried to shoot me, the guns would\r\nhave been fired on him, and there would have been bad work. But he was\r\nentirely pleased with the whole of the proceedings.\r\n\r\nYou ask about Abu Sultan (Sultan Pasha). He was disappointed, because\r\nwhen the Ministry was formed under Sherif Pasha he was not included in\r\nit. It was thought, however, that the post of President of the Chamber\r\nof Deputies was more honourable and more important. Only he did not take\r\nthis view, and was put out at being omitted from the Ministry. That was\r\nthe beginning of his turning against us.\r\n\r\nTo your question about the ill-treatment of the Circassians arrested for\r\na plot while I was Minister of War, I answer plainly, as I have answered\r\nbefore, I never went to the prison to see them tortured or ill-treated,\r\nI simply never went near them at all.\r\n\r\nAbout the riots of Alexandria there is no question but that it was due\r\nto the Khedive and Omar Pasha Loutfi, and also to Mr. Cookson. The riots\r\nwere certainly planned several days beforehand, and with the object of\r\ndiscrediting me, seeing that I had just given a guarantee of order being\r\npreserved. The Khedive sent the cyphered telegram you know of to Omar\r\nLoutfi, and Omar Loutfi arranged it with Seyd Kandil, the chief of the\r\nAlexandria _mustafezzin_. Seyd Kandil kept the thing from us who were at\r\nCairo. Mr. Cookson's part in it was that a number of cases of firearms\r\nwere landed, and sent to his consulate, obviously with the intention of\r\narming somebody. The moment I heard of what had happened, I sent Yakub\r\nSami to Alexandria with orders to make a full inquiry, and the facts\r\nwere abundantly proved. Much of what has been said however was\r\nincorrect. It is not true that the bodies of Christians were found\r\ndressed as Moslems. The riot began with a Maltese donkey boy, but that\r\nwas only the excuse. Omar Loutfi, as you say, was a strong partisan of\r\nIsmaïl's. You ask why a man so dangerous was left in a post where he\r\ncould work so much mischief. I can only say that he was not under the\r\norders of the Minister of War, but of the Interior. It was a misfortune\r\nhe was left there. Neither Nadim nor Hassan Moussa el Akkad went to\r\nAlexandria on any business of that kind. Hassan Moussa went there on a\r\nmoney errand.\r\n\r\nWhat you ask me is true about Ismaïl Pasha. He made us an offer of\r\nmoney. The circumstances of it were these. We had ordered a number of\r\npieces of light artillery from Germany, but they would not deliver them\r\nwithout payment, and we had none. Ismaïl Pasha offered to let us have\r\n£30,000 to pay this, on condition that we would allow it to be said that\r\nwe were acting in his interests. The offer was made through M. Mengs\r\n[Max Lavisson], Ismaïl's Russian agent, and Hassan Moussa had some hand\r\nin it. But it was never produced, and if Ismaïl really sent it to\r\nAlexandria, it remained there in their hands. We never touched it.\r\n\r\nI do not remember to have heard of any offer such as you speak of having\r\nbeen made by the Rothschilds [this was an offer made as I heard at the\r\ntime by the Paris Rothschilds of a pension to Arabi of £4,000 (100,000\r\nfrancs) yearly, if he would leave Egypt], but I received soon after the\r\nleyha [the note sent in by the Consuls demanding the dismissal of the\r\nMahmud Sami Ministry], a visit from the French Consul, during which he\r\nasked me what my pay then was, and offered me the double--that is to\r\nsay, £500 a month from the French Government if I would consent to leave\r\nEgypt and go to Paris and be treated there as Abd-el-Kader was treated.\r\nI refused, however, to have anything to do with it, telling him that it\r\nwas my business, if necessary, to fight and die for my country, not to\r\nabandon it. I never heard of the Rothschilds in connection with this\r\noffer.\r\n\r\nI will now give you an account of how Tel-el-Kebir was lost. Some days\r\nbefore, when the English were advancing, we made a plan to attack them\r\nat Kassassin. Mahmud Sami was to advance on their right flank from\r\nSalahieh, while we were to advance in front, and a third body was to go\r\nround by the desert, south of the Wady, and take them in the rear. The\r\nattack was tried and put partly in execution, but failed because the\r\nplan had been betrayed by Ali Bey Yusuf Khunfis, who sent the original\r\nsketch made by me to Lord Wolseley. He and others in the army had been\r\ncorrupted by Abou Sultan acting for the Khedive. When Mahmud advanced,\r\nhe found artillery posted to intercept him and retreated, leaving us\r\nunsupported, and the battle was lost. Sir Charles Wilson, while I was in\r\nprison at Cairo, brought me my plan, and asked me whether it was in my\r\nown hand, and I said \"yes,\" and he told me how they had come by it. \"It\r\nis a good plan,\" he said, \"and you might have beaten us with it.\"\r\n\r\nThis was our first misfortune. At Tel-el-Kebir we were taken by surprise\r\nand for the same reason of treachery. The cavalry commanders were all\r\nseduced by Abou Sultan's promises. They occupied a position in advance\r\nof the lines, and it was their duty to give us warning of any advance by\r\nthe English. But they moved aside and gave no warning. There was also\r\none traitor in command within the lines, Ali Bey Yusuf Khunfis. He lit\r\nlamps to direct the enemy, and then withdrew his men, leaving a wide\r\nspace open for them to pass through. You see the marks upon this carpet.\r\nThey just represent the lines. That is where Ali Yusuf was posted.\r\nMohammed Obeyd was there, and I was at this figure on the carpet a mile\r\nand a half to the rear. We were expecting no attack as no sound of\r\nfiring had been heard. I was still asleep when we heard the firing close\r\nto the lines. Ali Roubi, who was in command in front, sent news to me to\r\nchange my position as the enemy was taking us in flank. I said my prayer\r\nand galloped to where we had a reserve of volunteers, and called to them\r\nto follow me to support the front line. But they were only peasants, not\r\nsoldiers, and the shells were falling among them and they ran away. I\r\nthen rode forward alone with only my servant Mohammed with me, who,\r\nseeing that there was no one with me and that I was going to certain\r\ndeath, caught hold of my horse by the bridle and implored me to go back.\r\nThen seeing that the day was lost already, and that all were flying, I\r\nturned. Mohammed continued with me and we crossed the Wady at\r\nTel-el-Kebir, and keeping along the line of the Ismaïlia Canal reached\r\nBelbeis. There I had formed a second camp, and I found Ali Roubi arrived\r\nbefore me, and we thought to make a stand. But on the arrival of Drury\r\nLowe's cavalry none would stay, and so we abandoned all and took train\r\nfor Cairo. Ali Roubi made mistakes by extending the lines too far\r\nnorthwards, but he was loyal. The traitors were Abdul Ghaffar, I think,\r\nand certainly his second in command of the cavalry, Abd-el-Rahman Bey\r\nHassan, and Ali Yusuf Khunfis. You say Saoud el Tihawi, too. It may be\r\nso. Those Arabs were not to be trusted. His grandfather had joined\r\nBonaparte when he invaded us a hundred years ago.\r\n\r\nNow I return home after twenty years of sorrowful exile, and my own\r\npeople I laboured to deliver have come to believe, because the French\r\npapers have told them so, that I sold them to the English!\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GRAND MUFTI'S REMARKS ON THE ABOVE\r\n\r\n[N. B.--On March 18th, 1903, I read the foregoing account to Sheykh\r\nMohammed Abdu at his house at Aïn Shems. He approved most of it as\r\ncorrect, but made the following remarks:\r\n\r\n1. _As to the riot against Nubar._--Arabi's account of this is correct,\r\nexcept that the order given to Ali Ferny to fire on the students was not\r\nintended to be obeyed and was part of the comedy. Ali Fehmy fired over\r\ntheir heads by order. Latif Bey was arrested and imprisoned after the\r\nriot by Nubar, but was released on an application made to Nubar by the\r\nfreemasons, Latif being a member of that body. Latif in after days\r\nfreely acknowledged his share in the affair. As to what Arabi says of\r\nhis having proposed at that time to depose Ismaïl, there was certainly\r\nsecret talk of such action. Sheykh Jemal-ed-Din was in favour of it, and\r\nproposed to me, Mohammed Abdu, that Ismaïl should be assassinated some\r\nday as he passed in his carriage daily over the Kasr el Nil bridge, and\r\nI strongly approved, but it was only talk between ourselves, and we\r\nlacked a person capable of taking lead in the affair. If we had known\r\nArabi at that time, we might have arranged it with him, and it would\r\nhave been the best thing that could have happened, as it would have\r\nprevented the intervention of Europe. It would not, however, have been\r\npossible to establish a republic in the then state of political\r\nignorance of the people. As to Ismaïl's having taken away fifteen\r\nmillions with him to Naples, nobody knows the amount. All that is known\r\nis that it was very large. For the last few months of his reign Ismaïl\r\nhad been hoarding money, which he intercepted as it was sent in to the\r\nFinance Office from the Mudiriehs.\r\n\r\n2. _As to Tewfik in his father's time._--What Arabi says of Tewfik\r\nhaving taken presents for presenting petitions to Ismaïl may be true,\r\nbut the thing was not talked of, nor is it in accordance with Tewfik's\r\nconduct when in power. I do not believe it.\r\n\r\n3. _As to Riaz' tyranny._--Riaz was tyrannical, but not to the point of\r\nshedding blood. This he was always averse to. I do not remember any talk\r\nabout the people being made away with secretly by him. There was no\r\ndanger of such at any rate before the affair of the Kasr-el-Nil. During\r\nthe summer, however, of that year, 1881, there was talk of attempts\r\nagainst Arabi and the other colonels.\r\n\r\n4. _As to the affair of the Kasr-el-Nil, February 1st, 1881._--Arabi's\r\naccount is confused and incorrect. The first petition made by Arabi and\r\nthe officers was simply one of injustice being done them. It was made by\r\nOsman Rifki, and it drew down upon them the anger of the Minister of\r\nWar, who determined to get rid of them, and first brought Arabi under\r\nthe notice of the Consuls. Baron de Ring, who had a quarrel with Riaz,\r\ninterested himself in their case, but only indirectly. The petition\r\ntalked of by Arabi as having been drawn up in January by him and taken\r\nto Riaz, certainly contained no reference to a Constitution or to the\r\nincrease of the army to 18,000 men. These demands were not made until\r\nthe September demonstration. The petition of the Kasr-el-Nil time was\r\nsimply a strong complaint to Riaz of Osman Rifki's misdoings, and\r\ndemanding his dismissal from the Ministry of War. Riaz, at the council\r\nafter the demonstration, was in favour of its being made the subject of\r\nan inquiry, which would have necessitated the trial by court-martial not\r\nonly of the petitioners, but also of Osman Rifki. Riaz was not in favour\r\nof violence. But it was pointed out to him, privately, that if he\r\nopposed the more violent plan it would be said he was seeking to curry\r\nfavor with the soldiers as against the Khedive, and he, therefore, left\r\nthe matter to Osman Rifki, to be dealt with as he pleased.\r\n\r\n5. _As to the demonstration of Abdin, September 9th, 1881._--The seven\r\nmonths between the affair of Kasr-el-Nil and the demonstration of\r\nSeptember were months of great political activity, which pervaded all\r\nclasses. Arabi's action gained him much popularity, and put him into\r\ncommunication with the civilian members of the National party, such as\r\nSultan Pasha, Suliman Abaza, Hassain Shereï, and myself, and it was we\r\nwho put forward the idea of renewing the demand for a Constitution. The\r\npoint of view from which he at that time regarded it was as giving him\r\nand his military friends a security against reprisals by the Khedive of\r\nhis Ministers. He told me this repeatedly during the summer. We\r\nconsequently organized petitions for a Constitution, and carried on a\r\ncampaign for it in the press. Arabi saw a great deal of Sultan Pasha\r\nduring the summer, and Sultan, who was very rich, made much of him,\r\nsending him presents, such as farm produce, horses, and the rest, in\r\norder to encourage him, and to get this support for the constitutional\r\nmovement. It was in concert with Sultan that the demonstration of Abdin\r\nwas arranged, and it is quite true that Sultan expected to be named to a\r\nMinistry after the fall of Riaz. But Sherif Pasha, who became Prime\r\nMinister, did not think of him and overlooked him. Afterwards Sultan was\r\npacified and pleased when he was offered the presidency of the new\r\nChamber of Notables. It was not till after the _leyha_, ultimatum, that\r\nhe had any quarrel with Arabi. Then it is true that Arabi drew his sword\r\nin Sultan's presence and that of other members of the Chamber when they\r\nhesitated and were afraid to oppose the leyha. Up to this they had acted\r\ntogether. Arabi's account of the Khedive's message, \"You three are\r\nsoldiers. With me you are four,\" is excellent, and exactly shows the\r\nsituation as between him and the officers. Colvin certainly was with the\r\nKhedive at Abdin, but as he knew no Arabic he probably was not noticed\r\nby Arabi. It was Cookson who did the talking. Baron de Ring had been\r\nrecalled by his government on the request of Riaz, who complained of his\r\nencouragement of the officers.\r\n\r\n6. _As to the riots of Alexandria._--Arabi is correct in his account as\r\nregards Omar Loutfi and the Khedive, who had been arranging the riot for\r\nsome weeks. But it is not true as regards Seyd Kandil, who was only weak\r\nand failed to prevent it. He is also wrong about Cookson. The firearms\r\nintroduced into the Consulate were for the defence of the Maltese and\r\nother English subjects. Seyd Kandil was exiled for twenty years, but was\r\nallowed quietly to come back, and is now at his country place in Egypt,\r\nand I have often talked over the affair with him. If you like we will go\r\ntogether and pay him a visit next autumn. Arabi is right in saying that\r\nneither Hassan Moussa nor Nadim were concerned in the riot. Nadim went\r\ndown to Alexandria to deliver a lecture and Hassan on money business.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[The Mufti also added the following remarks on March 20th, 1903.\r\n\r\nThere was an attempt to introduce freemasonry into Egypt in the later\r\nyears of Ismaïl Pasha. The lodges were all connected with lodges in\r\nEurope. Sheykh Jemal-ed-Din joined one, but he soon found out that there\r\nwas nothing of any value in it and withdrew. Ismaïl encouraged it for\r\nhis purposes when he began to be in difficulties, but freemasonry never\r\nwas a power in Egypt.\r\n\r\nMohammed Obeyd was certainly killed at Tel-el-Kebir. There were rumours\r\nfor a long time of his having been seen in Syria, and we used to send\r\nfrom Beyrout when we were living there in exile to try and find him for\r\nhis wife's sake, who was at Beyrout, but they always turned out to be\r\nfalse reports.\r\n\r\nMahmud Sami was one of the original Constitutionalists, dating from the\r\ntime of Ismaïl. He was a friend of Sherif and belonged to the same\r\nschool of ideas. It is most probable that he gave warning to Arabi of\r\nhis intended arrest, as he was one of the Council of Ministers and must\r\nhave known. After the affair of Kasr-el-Nil he was altogether with Arabi\r\nand the Colonels. That was why Riaz got rid of him from the Ministry and\r\nappointed Daoud Pasha in his place.\r\n\r\nRiaz, at the beginning, underrated the importance of Arabi's action.\r\nAfterwards he was afraid of it. He began by despising it as he did all\r\nfellah influence in politics.\r\n\r\nSherif Pasha resigned in February, 1882, not on account of any quarrel\r\nwith Arabi, but because he was afraid of European intervention. He was\r\nopposed to an insistence on the power of voting the budget claimed by\r\nthe Chamber of Notables, and he retired so as not to be compromised.\r\n\r\nRagheb Pasha is (as mentioned by Ninet) of Greek descent, though a\r\nMoslem. He had been Minister under Ismaïl, but was a Constitutionalist.\r\nAfter the leyha he was named Prime Minister, with Arabi for Minister of\r\nWar. He acted honestly with Arabi, and remained with the National Party\r\nduring the war.\r\n\r\nButler gives May 20th, 1880, as the date of the first military petition.\r\nThat is probably correct.\r\n\r\nIbrahim el Aghany was one of the best and ablest of Jemal ed Din's\r\ndisciples at the Azhar. He is still living and employed in the Mékhemeh\r\n(?).\r\n\r\nWhen the Council was summoned to consider Arabi's petition asking for\r\nOsman Rifky's dismissal, the Khedive was with Osman Rifky for having\r\nArabi arrested and sent up the Nile, but Riaz at first was for an\r\ninquiry. During an adjournment, however, of the Council, Taha Pasha\r\npersuaded Riaz that if he was for lenient measures it would be thought\r\nhe was intriguing with the soldiers against the Khedive--to make himself\r\nKhedive--and Riaz thereupon made no further opposition. This I learned\r\nafterwards from Mahmud Sami who, as one of the Ministers, was present at\r\nthe Council.\r\n\r\nIbrahim Eff. el Wakil with Hassan Shereï and Ahmed Mahmud were the\r\nleaders of the liberal party in the Chamber of Notables.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFURTHER ACCOUNT GIVEN BY SHEYKH MOHAMMED ABDU, DECEMBER 22ND, 1903\r\n\r\n[When Sheykh Jemal-ed-Din was exiled a few days after the Sherif's\r\ndismissal in 1879, I was told to leave Cairo where I was professor in\r\nthe normal school, and to go to my village. My successor at the school\r\nwas Sheykh Hassan the blind. I was soon tired of being in my village and\r\nwent to Alexandria where I was watched by the police, so I went secretly\r\nto Tantah and wandered about for a long while. Then I came back to Cairo\r\nhoping to see Mahmud Sami, who was my friend, and at that time Minister\r\nof the Awkaf, but he was away, so I went to Ali Pasha Mubarak's,\r\nMinister of Public Works, who was also a friend, but he received me\r\nbadly, and everybody advised me not to stay, as it would be thought I\r\ncame in connection with a secret society which had been recently formed\r\nby Shahin Pasha and Omar Lutfi and other Ismaïlists against Riaz, so I\r\nwent to my village again. But again I grew tired of it, as the villagers\r\nwere always quarrelling and resolved to return once more and lecture at\r\nthe Azhar. Riaz Pasha was at that time in difficulty to find any one who\r\ncould write good Arabic in the Official Paper, and he consulted Mahmud\r\nSami, who told him that if there were but three more like me Egypt could\r\nbe saved. And my successor, Sheykh Hassan, gave him the same opinion of\r\nme.\r\n\r\nSo I was appointed at the end of Ramadan (October, 1880), third Editor\r\nof the Journal. But my two senior Editors were jealous and would give me\r\nno work to do. So the Journal was no better written. At this Riaz was\r\ndispleased, and made inquiry, and as the result I was made Editor, and a\r\nlittle later Director of the Press. This was before the end of 1880. The\r\nfirst time I saw you was when I called on you with Rogers Bey at the\r\nHôtel du Nil, and it was I who recommended to you Mohammed Khalil, and\r\nafterwards he brought you to see me at my house. I criticized the\r\nGovernment strongly in the Official Journal, and as Director of the\r\nPress allowed all liberty. But I was not in favour of a revolution, and\r\nthought that it would be enough if we had a Constitution in five years'\r\ntime. I disapproved of the overthrow of Riaz in September, 1881, and,\r\nabout ten days before the military demonstration at Abdin, I met Arabi\r\nat the house of Toulba Ismat, and Latif Bey Selim had come with him, and\r\nthere were many there. And I urged him to moderation, and said, \"I\r\nforesee that a foreign occupation will come and that a malediction will\r\nrest for ever on him who provokes it.\" On this Arabi said that he hoped\r\nit would not be he. And he told me at the same time that Sultan Pasha\r\nhad promised to bring petitions from every Notable in Egypt in favour of\r\nthe Constitution. This was true, for all the Omdehs were angry with Riaz\r\nfor having put down their habit of employing forced labour. Suliman\r\nAbaza would not join in the revolution as he thought it premature, and\r\nShereï Pasha was also against it. But when once the Constitution was\r\ngranted we all joined to protect it. But Arabi could not control the\r\narmy, where there were many ambitions.\r\n\r\nI did not know of the intended demonstration at Abdin, as I was known to\r\nbe friendly to Riaz, but it was arranged with Sultan Pasha and Sherif\r\nPasha. The Khedive was in a constant change of mind about Arabi at that\r\ntime, and joined Riaz and Daoud Pasha in their attempt to crush Arabi,\r\nbut the day before the event they told the Khedive, who, to overthrow\r\nRiaz, approved.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCONVERSATION WITH ARABI AT SHEYKH OBEYD, JANUARY 2ND, 1904\r\n\r\nYou ask me at what date the Khedive Tewfik put himself first into\r\ncommunication with us soldiers. It was in this way. Shortly before the\r\naffair of the Kasr-el-Nil he encouraged Ali Fehmy to go to us, with whom\r\nwe were already friends, his intention being to use him as a spy on us,\r\nhe being Colonel of the Guard. But Ali Fehmy joined us in our petition\r\nto Riaz Pasha, and was involved with us in our arrest. After the affair\r\nof the Kasr-el-Nil, and seeing the position we had gained in the minds\r\nof the people, the Khedive thought to make use of us against Riaz, and\r\nhe sent Ali Fehmy to us with the message, \"You three are soldiers. With\r\nme you make four.\" That was about a month after the affair, and we knew\r\nhe was favourable to us also through Mahmud Sami, who was then Minister\r\nof War. And Mahmud Sami told us, \"If ever you see me leave the Ministry,\r\nknow that the Khedive's mind is changed to you, and that there is\r\ndanger.\" In the course, therefore, of the summer (1881) when trouble\r\nbegan to begin for us through the spies of Riaz Pasha, who was Minister\r\nof the Interior, and who had us watched by the police, we had confidence\r\nin Mahmud Sami.\r\n\r\nAnd I was specially involved in displeasure through my refusal to allow\r\nmy soldiers to be taken from their military work to dig the Tewfikieh\r\nCanal, they being impressed for the labour by Ali Pasha Moubarak as\r\nMinister of Public Works. For this and for other reasons the Khedive\r\nturned from us, and resolved, with Riaz Pasha, to separate and disunite\r\nthe army; and the regiments were to be sent to distant places so that we\r\nshould not communicate one with the other. And Mahmud Sami was called\r\nupon, as Minister of War, to work their plan against us, the Khedive at\r\nthat time being at Alexandria with the rest of the Ministers. And when\r\nMahmud Sami refused, Riaz Pasha wrote to him, \"The Khedive has accepted\r\nyour resignation.\" And both he and the Khedive notified Mahmud Sami that\r\nhe was to go at once to his village in the neighbourhood of Tantah, and\r\nremain there, and not to go to Cairo, and on no account to have\r\ncommunication with us. He nevertheless came to Cairo to his house there,\r\nand we called on him, but he refused to see us. Then we knew that evil\r\nwas intended against us. And the Khedive appointed Daoud Pasha Yeghen in\r\nhis place, and the vexation on us increased, and we knew that attempts\r\nwere to be made against us. At the beginning of September the Khedive\r\nreturned to Cairo with Riaz and the Ministers, and it was resolved to\r\ndeal with us. Then I took counsel with Abd-el-Aal and Abd-el-Ghaffar,\r\nthe commander of the cavalry at Gesireh, and Fuda Bey Hassan, _Caimakam_\r\nin command at the Kaláa. The miralaï in command at the Kaláa had been\r\ndismissed by Mahmud Sami shortly before leaving office, and had not been\r\nreplaced. This miralaï was of us but _khaïn_ (a traitor), and we agreed\r\nthat we would make a demonstration and demand the dismissal of the whole\r\nMinistry, and that a Ministry favourable to the Wattan should replace\r\nthem, and that a Mejliss el Nawwab should be assembled, and that the\r\narmy should be raised to 18,000 men. But we did not tell Ali Fehmy of\r\nour design, for we did not wholly at that time trust him. And the next\r\nmorning I wrote stating our demands, and sent it to the Khedive at\r\nIsmaïlia Palace, saying that we should march to Abdin Palace at the\r\n_asr_, there to receive his answer. And the reason of our going to Abdin\r\nand not to Ismaïlia, where he lived, was that Abdin was his public\r\nresidence, and we did not wish to alarm the ladies of his household. But\r\nif he had not come to Abdin we should have marched on to Ismaïlia.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, the Khedive received our message he sent for Riaz Pasha\r\nand Khairy Pasha and Stone Pasha, and they went first to Abdin Barracks,\r\nwhere both the Khedive and Riaz Pasha spoke to the soldiers, and they\r\ngave orders to Ali Fehmy that he should, with his regiment, occupy the\r\nPalace of Abdin. And Ali Fehmy assented, and he posted his men in the\r\nupper rooms out of sight, so that they should be ready to fire on us\r\nfrom the windows. But I do not know whether they were given ball\r\ncartridge or not. Then the Khedive with the Generals went on to the\r\nKaláa, and they spoke to the soldiers there in the same sense, calling\r\non Fuda Bey to support the Khedive against us, the Khedive scolding him\r\nand saying, \"I shall put you in prison\"; but the soldiers surrounded the\r\ncarriage, and the Khedive was afraid and drove away, and he went on by\r\nthe advice of Riaz to Abassiyeh to speak to me, but I had already\r\nmarched with my regiment through the Hassaneyn quarter to Abdin. They\r\nasked about the artillery and were told that it also had gone to Abdin,\r\nand when the Khedive arrived there he found us occupying the square, the\r\nartillery and cavalry being before the west entrance, and I with my\r\ntroops before the main entrance, and already when I arrived before the\r\npalace I had sent in to Ali Fehmy, who I had heard was there, and had\r\nspoken to him, and he had withdrawn his men from the palace, and they\r\nstood with us.\r\n\r\nAnd the Khedive entered by the back door on the east side, and presently\r\nhe came out to us with his generals and aides-de-camp, but I did not see\r\nColvin with him, though he may have been there, and he called on me to\r\ndismount, and I dismounted, and he called on me to put up my sword, and\r\nI put up my sword, but the officers approached with me to prevent\r\ntreachery, about fifty in number, and some of them placed themselves\r\nbetween him and the palace, but Riaz Pasha was not with the Khedive in\r\nthe square, and remained in the palace. And when I had delivered my\r\nmessage and made my three demands to the Khedive, he said, \"I am Khedive\r\nof the country and shall do as I like\" (\"_and Khedeywi 'l beled wa 'amal\r\nzey ma inni awze_\"). I replied, \"We are not slaves, and we shall never\r\nmore be inherited from this day forth\" (\"_Nahnu ma abid wa la nurithu\r\nba'd el yom_\"). He said nothing more, but turned and went back into the\r\npalace. And presently they sent out Cookson to me with his interpreter,\r\nand he asked me why, being a soldier, I made demand of a parliament, and\r\nI said that it was to put an end to arbitrary rule, and pointed to the\r\ncrowd of citizens supporting us behind the soldiers. He threatened me,\r\nsaying, \"We shall bring a British army,\" and much discussion took place\r\nbetween us, and he returned six or seven times to the palace, and came\r\nout again six or seven times to me, until finally he informed me that\r\nthe Khedive had agreed to all, and the Khedive wished for Haidar Pasha\r\nto replace Riaz. But I would not consent, and when it was put to me to\r\nsay I named Sherif Pasha, because he had declared himself in favour of a\r\nMejliss el Nawwab, and I had known him a little in former times, in the\r\ntime of Saïd Pasha, when he served with the army. And in the evening the\r\nKhedive sent for me and I went to him at Ismaïlia Palace, and I thanked\r\nhim for having agreed to our request, but he said only, \"That is enough.\r\nGo now and occupy Abdin, and let it be without music in the streets\"\r\n(lest that should be taken as a token of rejoicing).\r\n\r\nAnd when Ali Pasha Nizami came to Cairo with Ahmed Pasha Ratib from the\r\nSultan, the Khedive was alarmed lest an inquiry should be made, and\r\nMahmud Sami being again Minister of War ordered us to leave Cairo, and I\r\nwent to Ras-el-Wady and Abd-el-Aal to Damiata, but Ali Fehmy remained at\r\nCairo. And I saw nothing of Ali Nizami. But being at Zagazig on a visit\r\nto friends, Ahmed Eff. Shemsi and Suliman Pasha Abaza, as I was\r\nreturning by train to Ras el Wady, it happened that Ahmed Pasha Ratib\r\nwas on his way to Suez, for he was going on to Mecca on pilgrimage. And\r\nI found myself in the same carriage with him, and we exchanged\r\ncompliments as strangers, and I asked him his name, and he asked me my\r\nname, and he told me of his pilgrimage and other things, but he did not\r\nspeak of his mission to the Khedive, nor did I ask. But I told him that\r\nI was loyal to the Sultan as the head of our religion, and I also\r\nrelated to him all that had occurred, and he said, \"You did well.\" And\r\nat Ras el Wady I left him, and afterwards he sent me a Koran from\r\nJeddah, and later, on his return to Stamboul, he wrote to me, saying\r\nthat he had spoken favourably of me to the Sultan, and afterwards I\r\nreceived a letter dictated by the Sultan to Sheykh Mohammed Dhaffar\r\ntelling me what I know.\r\n\r\nAs to Yakub Sami, he was of family originally Greek from Stamboul. He\r\nwent by my order to Alexandria to inquire into the affair of the riot,\r\nbut they would not allow a true inquiry to be made into it. It was Yakub\r\nSami who, with Ragheb Pasha, proposed that we should cut off the\r\nKhedive's head. You say we should have done better to do so, but I\r\nwished to gain the end of our revolution without the shedding of a drop\r\nof blood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX II\r\n\r\nPROGRAMME OF THE NATIONAL PARTY OF EGYPT, FORWARDED BY MR. BLUNT TO MR.\r\nGLADSTONE, DEC. 20TH, 1881, WITH MR. GLADSTONE'S ANSWERS\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The National party of Egypt accept the existing relations of Egypt\r\nwith the Porte as the basis of their movement. That is to say: They\r\nacknowledge the Sultan Abd el Hamid Khan as their Suzerain and Lord, and\r\nas actual Caliph or Head of the Mussulman religion; nor do they propose,\r\nwhile his empire stands, to alter this relationship. They admit the\r\nright of the Porte to the tribute fixed by law, and to military\r\nassistance in case of foreign war. At the same time, they are firmly\r\ndetermined to defend their national rights and privileges, and to\r\noppose, by every means in their power, the attempts of those who would\r\nreduce Egypt again to the condition of a Turkish Pashalik. They trust in\r\nthe protecting Powers of Europe, and especially in England, to continue\r\ntheir guarantee of Egypt's administrative independence.\r\n\r\n2. The National party express their loyal allegiance to the person of\r\nthe reigning Khedive. They will continue to support Mohammed Towfik's\r\nauthority as long as he shall rule in accordance with justice and the\r\nlaw, and in fulfilment of his promises made to the people of Egypt in\r\nSeptember 1881. They declare, however, their intention to permit no\r\nrenewal of that despotic reign of injustice which Egypt has so often\r\nwitnessed, and to insist upon the exact execution of his promise of\r\nParliamentary government and of giving the country freedom. They invite\r\nHis Highness, Mohammed Towfik, to act honestly by them in these matters,\r\npromising him their cordial help; but they warn him against listening to\r\nthose who would persuade him to continue his despotic power, to betray\r\ntheir national rights, or to elude his promises.\r\n\r\n3. The National party fully recognize the services rendered to Egypt by\r\nthe Governments of England and France, and they are aware that all\r\nfreedom and justice they have obtained in the past has been due to them.\r\nFor this they tender them their thanks. They recognize the European\r\nControl as a necessity of their financial position, and the present\r\ncontinuance of it as the best guarantee of their prosperity. They\r\ndeclare their entire acceptance of the foreign debt as a matter of\r\n_national honour_--this, although they know that it was incurred, not\r\nfor Egypt's benefit, but in the private interests of a dishonest and\r\nirresponsible ruler--and they are ready to assist the Controllers in\r\ndischarging the full national obligations. They look, nevertheless, upon\r\nthe existing order of things as in its nature temporary, and avow it as\r\ntheir hope gradually to redeem the country out of the hands of its\r\ncreditors. Their object is, some day to see Egypt entirely in Egyptian\r\nhands. Also they are not blind to the imperfections of the Control,\r\nwhich they are ready to point out. They know that many abuses are\r\ncommitted by those employed by it, whether Europeans or others. They see\r\nsome of these incapable, others dishonest, others too highly paid. They\r\nknow that many offices, now held by strangers, would be better\r\ndischarged by Egyptians, and at a fifth of the cost; and they believe\r\nthere is still much waste and much injustice. They cannot understand\r\nthat Europeans living in the land should remain for ever exempt from the\r\ngeneral taxation, or from obedience to the general law. The National\r\nparty does not, however, propose to remedy these evils by any violent\r\naction; only it would protest against their unchecked continuance. They\r\nwould have the Governments of France and England consider that, having\r\ntaken the control of their finances out of the hands of the Egyptians,\r\nthey are responsible for their prosperity, and are bound to see that\r\nefficient and honest persons only are employed by them.\r\n\r\n4. The National party disclaim all connection with those who, in the\r\ninterest of Powers jealous of Egypt's independence, seek to trouble the\r\npeace of the country--and there are many such--or with those who find\r\ntheir private advantage in disturbance. At the same time they are aware\r\nthat a merely passive attitude will not secure them liberty in a land\r\nwhich is still ruled by a class to whom liberty is hateful. The silence\r\nof the people made Ismaïl Pasha's rule possible in Egypt, and silence\r\nnow would leave their hope of political liberty unfulfilled. The\r\nEgyptians have learned in the last few years what freedom means, and\r\nthey are resolved to complete their national education. This they look\r\nto find in the Parliament just assembling, in a fair measure of freedom\r\nfor the press, and in the general growth of knowledge among all classes\r\nof the people. They know, however, that none of these means of education\r\ncan be secured except by the firm attitude of the national leaders. The\r\nEgyptian Parliament may be cajoled or frightened into silence, as at\r\nConstantinople; the press may be used as an instrument against them, and\r\nthe sources of instruction cut off. It is for this reason and for no\r\nother that the National party has confided its interests at the present\r\ntime to the army, believing them to be the only power in the country\r\nable and willing to protect its growing liberties. It is not, however,\r\nin the plans of the party that this state of things shall continue; and\r\nas soon as the people shall have established their rights securely the\r\narmy will abandon its present political attitude. In this the military\r\nleaders fully concur. They trust that on the assembling of the\r\nParliament their further interference in affairs of State may be\r\nunnecessary. But for the present they will continue to perform their\r\nduty as the armed guardians of the unarmed people. Such being their\r\nposition, they hold it imperative that their force should be maintained\r\nefficient, and their complement made up to the full number of 18,000\r\nmen. They trust that the European Control will keep this necessity in\r\nview when considering the army estimates.\r\n\r\n5. The National party of Egypt is a political, not a religious party. It\r\nincludes within its ranks men of various races and various creeds. It is\r\nprincipally Mohammedan, because nine-tenths of the Egyptians are\r\nMohammedans; but it has the support of the Moors, of the Coptic\r\nChristians, of the Jews, and others who cultivate the soil and speak the\r\nlanguage of Egypt. Between these it makes no distinction whatever,\r\nholding all men to be brothers and to have equal rights, both political\r\nand before the law. This principle is accepted by all the chief Sheykhs\r\nof the Azhar who support the party, holding the true law of Islam to\r\nforbid religious hatred and religious disabilities. With Europeans\r\nresident in Egypt the National party has no quarrel, either as\r\nChristians or as strangers, so long as these shall live comformably with\r\nthe laws and bear their share of the burdens of the State.\r\n\r\n6. Finally, the general end of the National party is the intellectual\r\nand moral regeneration of the country by a better observance of the law,\r\nby increased education, and by political liberty, which they hold to be\r\nthe life of the people. They trust in the sympathy of those of the\r\nnations of Europe which enjoy the blessing of self-government to aid\r\nEgypt in gaining for itself that blessing; but they are aware that no\r\nnation ever yet achieved liberty except by its own endeavours; and they\r\nare resolved to stand firm in the position they have won, trusting to\r\nGod's help if all other be denied them.\r\n\r\n_December 18, 1881._\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. GLADSTONE'S ANSWER\r\n\r\n     Hawarden Castle, Chester,\r\n\r\n     _Jan. 20th, 1882_.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n     You will I am sure appreciate the reasons which disable me from\r\n     offering anything like a becoming reply to your very interesting\r\n     letter on Egyptian affairs, which occupy, I am sorry to say, an\r\n     insignificant share of my daily attention.\r\n\r\n     But I am sensible of the advantage of having such a letter from\r\n     such an authority, and I feel quite sure that unless there be a sad\r\n     failure of good sense on one or both, or, as I should say, all\r\n     sides, we shall be enabled to bring this question to a favourable\r\n     issue.\r\n\r\n     My own opinions about Egypt were set forth in the \"19th Century\" a\r\n     short time before we took office, and I am not aware as yet of\r\n     having seen any reason to change them.\r\n\r\n     I remain, my Dear Sir,\r\n\r\n     Faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n     W. E. GLADSTONE.\r\n\r\n     Wilfrid S. Blunt, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n     10, Downing Street, Whitehall,\r\n\r\n     _Jan. 21st, 1882_.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR WILFRID,\r\n\r\n     I feel I owe you a great apology for your not having received an\r\n     earlier acknowledgment of your most able and interesting\r\n     communication on the Egyptian movement. Holiday making must be my\r\n     excuse; but my absence from Downing Street did not prevent the\r\n     prompt submission of your letter to Mr. Gladstone, from whom I\r\n     enclose a note. He is sorry that it is somewhat tardy in its\r\n     despatch.\r\n\r\n     It is difficult, if not impossible, to write on the present\r\n     critical state of affairs, when the situation may alter from day to\r\n     day.\r\n\r\n     You may imagine that the alleged national character to the movement\r\n     necessarily commends itself to Mr. Gladstone with his well-known\r\n     sympathy with young nationalities struggling for independence. The\r\n     great crux (I am of course only speaking for myself, and with a\r\n     strong consciousness of ignorance) seems to be, how to favour such\r\n     a movement with due regard to the responsibilities in which we have\r\n     been involved, and the vested interests which are at stake. Every\r\n     alternative seems to be beset with insuperable objections and\r\n     insurmountable difficulties. I can only say that if you can do\r\n     anything towards finding a solution for these difficulties you will\r\n     be doing a great work for Egypt, for the country, and for the\r\n     present Government. I know that you have already been of great\r\n     service, and are entitled to speak on this question with greater\r\n     authority than almost any one else.\r\n\r\n     With special regards to Lady Anne, and apologies for such a cursory\r\n     uninteresting note in return for your information,\r\n\r\n     Always yrs. affectionately\r\n\r\n     E. W. HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. GLADSTONE'S ANSWER TO MR. BLUNT'S SECOND LETTER DATED CAIRO,\r\nFEBRUARY 7TH, 1882\r\n\r\n     10, Downing Street, Whitehall,\r\n\r\n     _2nd March, 1882_.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR WILFRID,\r\n\r\n     Mr. Gladstone has read with much interest your further letter, for\r\n     which he is much obliged. He hopes that you will have felt, or will\r\n     feel, assured from the language in the speech from the Throne, of\r\n     which I enclose by his desire a copy, that the British Government,\r\n     while intending firmly to uphold international engagements, have a\r\n     sympathy with Egyptian feelings in reference to the purposes and\r\n     means of good government.\r\n\r\n     Yours always,\r\n\r\n     E. W. HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACT FROM THE QUEEN'S SPEECH FORWARDED TO MR. BLUNT BY MR. HAMILTON\r\n\r\nIn concert with the President of the French Republic, I have given\r\ncareful attention to the affairs of Egypt, where existing arrangements\r\nhave imposed on me special obligations. I shall use my influence to\r\nmaintain the rights already established, whether by the Firmans of the\r\nSultan or by various international engagements, in a spirit favourable\r\nto the good government of the country and the prudent development of its\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX III\r\n\r\nTEXT OF THE EGYPTIAN CONSTITUTION OF FEBRUARY 7TH, 1882\r\n\r\n\r\n(_N.B._--This occurs in Blue Book, Egypt, No. 7 (1882), but is given\r\nthere in French only. The clauses embodying the amendments or\r\nexplanations obtained at Sir Edward Malet's and Sir Auckland Colvin's\r\ninstance by the author on January 19th, 1882, are marked with an\r\nasterisk.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM MAHMOUD SAMY PASHA ON TAKING OFFICE, FEBRUARY 2ND, 1882, TO\r\nHIS HIGHNESS THE KHEDIVE\r\n\r\n     MONSEIGNEUR,\r\n\r\n     Your Highness has condescended to entrust to me the care of forming\r\n     a new Cabinet; I consider it as the first of my duties to submit to\r\n     you the principles which will guide my conduct and inspire that of\r\n     the Ministry over which I am to preside.\r\n\r\n     The events which have succeeded each other in Egypt for some years\r\n     past have prejudiced public opinion in various ways here, and in\r\n     foreign countries. These prejudices relate to two orders of ideas:\r\n     our financial expenditure and our internal reforms.\r\n\r\n     The general debt of the country was definitely regulated by a\r\n     series of Decrees which was itself completed by the Law of\r\n     Liquidation of 19th July, 1880.\r\n\r\n     These laws have acquired the character of International\r\n     Conventions. Your Highness's Government has never ceased to respect\r\n     them. The Ministry will watch over their exact and faithful\r\n     execution.\r\n\r\n     The liquidation of the floating debt is an accomplished fact for\r\n     all those interested (and they are immensely in the majority) whose\r\n     rights have been recognized up to now by the competent authorities;\r\n     it will continue to be actively proceeded with.\r\n\r\n     The service of the Consolidated Debt, which includes the special\r\n     administrations of the Daïra and the Domains employed to guarantee\r\n     the Loan of 1878 is being regularly performed. The administrations\r\n     which were created to secure this service, the General Control, the\r\n     Commission of the Debt, the Control of the Daïra, the Commission of\r\n     Domains, are institutions which must be always loyally supported by\r\n     the Government; they have always been so up to the present day.\r\n\r\n     Nothing will be changed in this state of things in the future: the\r\n     Ministry will endeavour to consolidate these institutions and to\r\n     facilitate their action. It considers harmony in all these public\r\n     services as an essential condition to the regular course of\r\n     affairs, and it thinks that the general administration of the\r\n     country owes incontestable advantages to this policy.\r\n\r\n     Your Highness has always been convinced that, to accomplish\r\n     internal reforms with wisdom and security, the co-operation of a\r\n     Chamber of Deputies was necessary, and it is with this idea that\r\n     the present Chamber has been convoked.\r\n\r\n     The Ministry share these sentiments. They will concentrate all\r\n     their attention upon the reorganization of the Tribunals, the\r\n     reform of the administration, the improvements necessary to public\r\n     education to aid the country to advance in the path of progress and\r\n     civilization. They will study measures suitable for the development\r\n     of agriculture, commerce, and industry, as well as all the other\r\n     projects of reform which have been the object of your Highness's\r\n     constant solicitude. But before all they believe it necessary to\r\n     determine the powers of the Chamber of Deputies, in order to enable\r\n     it to give to the Government the co-operation which it expects, and\r\n     to realize the hopes of the people.\r\n\r\n     This is why the Cabinet's first act will be to sanction an Organic\r\n     Law for the Chamber of Deputies.\r\n\r\n     This law will respect all rights and obligations of a private or\r\n     international character, as well as all engagements relating to the\r\n     Public Debt and to the charges which the latter imposes upon the\r\n     State Budget. It will determine wisely the responsibility of the\r\n     Ministers before the Chamber, as well as the mode of discussing the\r\n     laws.\r\n\r\n     Far from being a source of anxiety, this Organic Law will unite all\r\n     the conditions necessary for securing the interests of the public.\r\n\r\n     Such is, Monseigneur, the programme of the new Ministry,\r\n     conformable to the wishes of the country.\r\n\r\n     The High Powers--and particularly the Sublime Porte, whose friendly\r\n     support has never failed us in the exercise of the rights and\r\n     privileges which it has granted us--will continue, I confidently\r\n     hope, to lend to your Highness's Government, as in the past, that\r\n     valuable co-operation which has always been beneficial to Egypt.\r\n\r\n     I also hope that the authority of your Government will be devoted\r\n     solely to safeguarding individual rights and the maintenance of\r\n     order, and that it will guide the nation in the way of progress and\r\n     prosperity.\r\n\r\n     The day on which your Highness took in hand the reins of power you\r\n     promised to Egypt a new era of progress. We come to assure your\r\n     Highness of our absolute unanimity for the realization of that\r\n     promise. The goal you would attain, Monseigneur, is the same which\r\n     we are striving for. Full of confidence in you, we have faith in\r\n     the future.\r\n\r\n     If your Highness deigns to consent to the programme which I submit,\r\n     I have the honour to beg your Highness to sanction the decrees\r\n     which I present for signature, to constitute the Ministry.\r\n\r\n     MAHMOUD SAMY.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM HIS HIGHNESS THE KHEDIVE TO HIS EXCELLENCE MAHMOUD SAMY\r\nPASHA\r\n\r\n     15, Rabi-Awel, 1299.\r\n\r\n     (February 4, 1882.)\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR MAHMOUD SAMY PASHA,\r\n\r\n     In accepting the task of forming a new Cabinet, without being\r\n     ignorant of the importance of this undertaking, you give a new\r\n     proof of your devotion and of your patriotism. If I have charged\r\n     you with this mission, it is because I knew these your noble\r\n     sentiments of which you have given many proofs, by the numerous\r\n     services you have rendered in the various offices you have already\r\n     filled. I approve of your programme, and of the principles which\r\n     you develop in it. These principles are the foundation of justice.\r\n     They are calculated to maintain and assure order in the country as\r\n     well to give security to all those who inhabit it.\r\n\r\n     I share your opinion that my Government should take the necessary\r\n     measures to ensure judicial and administrative reforms, and that it\r\n     should promulgate for the Chamber of Deputies the Organic Law in\r\n     conformity with the ideas explained in your programme.\r\n\r\n     My Government ought also to take upon itself the task of developing\r\n     public instruction, agriculture, commerce, and industry. My loyal\r\n     and sincere co-operation shall always be yours in the\r\n     accomplishment of this object.\r\n\r\n     I pray God to crown our common efforts for the benefit and\r\n     prosperity of the people.\r\n\r\n     MEHEMET TEWFIK.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECREE\r\n\r\nWe, Khedive of Egypt,\r\n\r\nIn view of our Decree of the 4th October, 1881 (11 Zilcadé, 1298),\r\n\r\nIn view of the decision of the Chamber of Delegates, and conformably\r\nwith the advice of our Council of Ministers,\r\n\r\n     Have decreed and decree,\r\n\r\n_Art. 1._ The Members of the Chamber of Deputies are elected.\r\nAn ulterior and special Law will make known the conditions of\r\nelectorability and of eligibility for election, and at the same time the\r\nmode of election to the Chamber of Deputies.\r\n\r\n_Art. 2._ The Members of the Chamber of Deputies are elected for a\r\nperiod of five years.

All Deputies thus dismissed shall be eligible for\r\nreelection.\r\n\r\n_Art. 24._ If the new Chamber confirms by its vote that of the preceding\r\nChamber which had provoked the disagreement, this vote shall be accepted\r\nas final.\r\n\r\n_*Art. 25._ The Bills and Regulations emanating from the initiative of\r\nthe Government shall be brought into the Chamber of Deputies by the\r\nMinisters, to be examined, discussed and voted. No Law shall become\r\nvalid until it has been read before the Chamber of Deputies, Article by\r\nArticle, voted clause by clause, and consented to by the Khedive. Each\r\nBill shall be read three times and between each reading there shall have\r\nbeen an interval of fifteen days. In case of urgency a single reading\r\nshall, by a special vote of the Chamber, be declared sufficient. If the\r\nChamber judges it necessary to demand the introduction of a Bill from\r\nthe Council of Ministers, it shall make the demand through the\r\nintermediary of the President of the Chamber, and in case of the\r\napproval of the Government, the Bill shall be prepared by the Ministry\r\nand introduced to the Chamber according to the forms fixed by this\r\nArticle.\r\n\r\n_Art. 26._ The Chamber shall choose from amongst its Members a\r\nCommittee, charged to examine all Bills and Regulation submitted to it.\r\nThis Committee may propose to the Government amendments of such bills as\r\nit has been charged to examine; in which case, the bill and the\r\namendments proposed shall be sent back, before any general discussion,\r\nby the President of the Chamber, to the President of the Council of\r\nMinisters.\r\n\r\n_Art. 27._ If the Committee does not propose any amendments or if those\r\nproposed are not adopted by the Government, the original text of the\r\nBill shall be placed for discussion before the Chamber. If the\r\namendments proposed by the Committee are accepted by the Government,\r\nthen the text thus amended shall be placed for discussion before the\r\nChamber. In case the Government should not accept the amendments\r\nproposed by the Committee, then the latter shall have the right of\r\nsubmitting its opinion and observations to the Chamber.\r\n\r\n_Art. 28._ The Chamber of Deputies may adopt or reject all Bills\r\nsubmitted to it by the Committee. It may also return them to the\r\nCommittee to be examined a second time.\r\n\r\n_Art. 29._ The President of the Chamber shall convey to the President of\r\nthe Council of Ministers the Laws and Regulations voted by the Chamber.\r\n\r\n_Art. 30._ No fresh tax--direct or indirect--on movable, immovable or\r\npersonal property may be imposed in Egypt without a Law voted by the\r\nChamber. It is therefore formally forbidden that any new tax shall be\r\nlevied, under whatever title or denomination it may be, without having\r\nbeen previously voted by the Chamber of Deputies, under penalty, against\r\nthe authority which shall have ordered it, against the employés who\r\nshall have drawn up the schedules and tariffs and against those who\r\nshall have effected the recovery of the amounts, of being prosecuted as\r\npeculators. All contributions thus unduly levied shall be returned to\r\nthose who have paid them.\r\n\r\n_Art. 31._ The Annual Budget of the Receipts and Expenditures of the\r\nState shall be communicated to the Chamber of Deputies not later than\r\nthe 5th of November of each year.\r\n\r\n_Art. 32._ The General Budget of Receipts shall be presented to the\r\nChamber, accompanied by notes explanatory of the nature of each receipt.\r\n\r\n_Art. 33._ The Budget of Expenditure shall be divided Department by\r\nDepartment, and shall be subdivided into sections and chapters,\r\ncorresponding to the various branches of the public service depending\r\nupon each Ministry.\r\n\r\n_Art. 34._ The following cannot on any account be objects of discussion\r\nin the Chamber:\r\n\r\n     The service of the Tribute due to the Sublime Porte.\r\n\r\n     The service of the Public Debt.\r\n\r\nAlso all matters relating to the Debt and resulting from the Law of\r\nLiquidation, or Conventions existing between the Foreign Powers and the\r\nEgyptian Government.\r\n\r\n_*Art. 35._ The Budget shall be sent to the Chamber, to be examined and\r\ndiscussed there (under reserve of the preceding Article).\r\n\r\nA Committee composed of as many Deputies, and having the same number of\r\nvotes as the Members of the Council of Ministers and its President,\r\nshall be named by the Chamber to discuss, in common with the Council of\r\nMinisters, the Budget Estimates, and to vote them either unanimously or\r\naccording to the majority.\r\n\r\n_Art. 36._ In case of an exact division of votes between the Commission\r\nof the Chamber and the Council of Ministers, the Budget shall be\r\nreturned to the Chamber and, should the Chamber confirm (by its vote)\r\nthat of the Council of Ministers, this vote shall become executory\r\n(_exécutoire_). But if the Chamber should maintain the vote of its\r\nCommittee, then the procedure shall be according to Articles 23 and 24\r\nof the present Law. In this case, the credits of the Budget Estimates\r\nwhich shall have caused the division of votes, if they figured in the\r\nBudget of the preceding year, and if they are not affected to any new\r\nobject of expenditure, such as public works or others, shall be employed\r\nprovisionally and until the meeting of the new Chamber, according to\r\nArticle 23.\r\n\r\n_Art. 37._ If the new Chamber confirms the vote of the preceding\r\nChamber, on the Budget, this vote shall become definitely executory, in\r\nconformity with Article 23.\r\n\r\n_Art. 38._ No Treaty or contract between the Government and third\r\nparties and no farming concession shall acquire a final character\r\nwithout having been first approved by a vote of the Chamber, provided\r\nthat such Treaty, contract or concession does not relate to an\r\nobject for which a sum has already figured in the approved Budget,\r\ncorresponding to the year for which the Treaty, contract or concession\r\nshall have been proposed. Likewise no concession for public works, the\r\nexecution of which shall not have been foreseen by the Budget, and no\r\nsale, or gratuitous alienation of the State domains, nor concession of\r\nprivilege of any kind shall become definitive until it shall have been\r\napproved by the Chamber.\r\n\r\n_Art. 39._ All Egyptians may address a petition to the Chamber of\r\nDeputies. The petitions shall be sent to a Committee chosen by the\r\nChamber from among its Members. Upon the report of this Committee the\r\nChamber shall take into consideration or reject the petitions. The\r\npetitions taken into consideration shall be sent back to the Minister\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n_Art. 40._ All petitions relative to personal rights or interests shall\r\nbe rejected if they are outside the competence of the Administrative and\r\nCivil Tribunals, or if they have not been previously addressed to the\r\ncompetent administrative authority.\r\n\r\n_Art. 41._ If during the recess of the Chamber grave circumstances shall\r\ndemand that urgent measures be taken to avoid a danger menacing the\r\nState, or to assure public order, the Council of Ministers may, then,\r\nupon its own responsibility and with the sanction of the Khedive, order\r\nthose measures to be taken, even if they should be within the competence\r\nof the Chamber, supposing the time to be too short for the convocation\r\nof the latter. Nevertheless, the affair should be submitted for\r\nexamination, at its next sitting, to the Chamber.\r\n\r\n_Art. 42._ No one may be admitted to explain or discuss questions or to\r\ntake part in the deliberations of the Chamber other than its Members,\r\nwith the exception of the Ministers or of those who are assisting or\r\nrepresenting them.\r\n\r\n_Art. 43._ The votes of the Chamber shall be given by the holding up of\r\nhands or by calling over of names or by ballot.\r\n\r\n_Art. 44._ The vote by calling over of names shall only be on the demand\r\nof at least ten Members of the Chamber of Deputies. All votes which may\r\naffect the provisions of Article 47 shall be made openly.\r\n\r\n_Art. 45._ The naming of the three candidates for the Presidency of the\r\nChamber, as well as the election of the two Vice-Presidents and the\r\nnomination of the first and second Secretaries to the Chamber shall be\r\nmade by ballot.\r\n\r\n_Art. 46._ The Chamber of Deputies may not validly deliberate unless at\r\nleast two-thirds of its Members are present at the deliberation. All\r\ndecisions shall be taken absolutely according to the majority of votes.\r\n\r\n_Art. 47._ No votes entailing Ministerial responsibility shall be given\r\nwithout a majority of at least three-quarters of the Members present.\r\n\r\n_Art. 48._ No opinion shall be given by proxy.\r\n\r\n_Art. 49._ The Chamber of Deputies shall elaborate its own internal\r\nRegulations. These shall be made executory by Decree of the Khedive.\r\n\r\n_*Art. 50._ The present Organic Law may be amended after agreement\r\nbetween the Chamber of Deputies and the Council of Ministers.\r\n\r\n_*Art. 51._ The interpretation of all Articles and phrases of the\r\npresent law which it may be necessary to make clear shall be made on\r\nagreement between the Chamber of Deputies and the Council of Ministers.\r\n\r\n_Art. 52._ All provisions of Laws, Decrees, Superior Orders,\r\nRegulations, or Usages contrary to the present Law are and shall remain\r\nrevoked.\r\n\r\n_Art. 53._ Our Ministers are charged, each in what concerns him, with\r\nthe execution of the present Law.\r\n\r\nDone in the Palace of Ismaïlieh, 7th February, 1882 (18 Rabi Awel,\r\n1299).\r\n\r\n(_Signed_) MEHEMET TEWFIK.\r\n\r\n    By the Khedive:\r\n\r\n    The President of the Council of Ministers, Minister of the Interior.\r\n    (_Signed_) MAHMOUD SAMY.\r\n\r\n    The Minister of Foreign Affairs and of Justice.\r\n    MOUSTAPHA FEHMY.\r\n\r\n    The Minister of War and Marine.\r\n    AHMED ARABI.\r\n\r\n    The Minister of Finance.\r\n    ALI SADIK.\r\n\r\n    The Minister of Public Works.\r\n    MAHMOUD FEHMY.\r\n\r\n    The Minister of Public Instruction.\r\n    ABDALLAH FIKRY.\r\n\r\n    The Minister of the Wakfs.\r\n    HASSAN CHÉRÉY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX IV\r\n\r\nLETTER RECEIVED BY MR. BLUNT FROM BOGHOS PASHA NUBAR AS TO HIS FATHER\r\nNUBAR PASHA'S POLITICAL CONNECTION WITH THE KHEDIVE ISMAÏL. (TRANSLATED\r\nFROM THE FRENCH.)\r\n\r\n\r\n     Paris, _September 26th, 1907_.\r\n\r\n     SIR,\r\n\r\n     I have just read in the _Egyptian Gazette_ of the 14th instant your\r\n     reply to Mr. Lucy about the Cyprus Convention, and I was very glad\r\n     to observe the offer you made in it of correcting in your book any\r\n     errors which might be pointed out to you. It has decided me to\r\n     appeal to your loyalty in regard to a mistake about my father which\r\n     has found its way into it. I do not know from what sources you have\r\n     drawn your information, nor do I doubt your good faith, which has\r\n     certainly been misled.\r\n\r\n     You say that Nubar Pasha was Ismaïl's Minister of Finance, and that\r\n     in virtue of this office he was responsible for the ruinous loans\r\n     contracted by the latter. This is evidently a complete mistake, my\r\n     father never having been Minister of Finance, and having had\r\n     nothing to do directly or indirectly with any of the loans.\r\n\r\n     The only offices which he filled during Ismaïl's reign were the\r\n     Ministry of Public Works and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He\r\n     was never, I repeat, Minister of Finance, for this very good reason\r\n     that, in spite of his great intelligence and qualities as a\r\n     statesman, he recognized that he did not understand financial\r\n     questions, and the Khedive, who also knew it, would never have\r\n     thought of confiding a Ministry to him, which he himself felt he\r\n     was incapable of directing.\r\n\r\n     Ismaïl's Minister of Finance was the Moufettish Ismaïl Pasha Sadek,\r\n     whom you speak of on pages 18, 39 and 40 of your book. He was the\r\n     sole collaborator and confidant of the Khedive upon financial\r\n     matters, and it was he who organized the loans.\r\n\r\n     As to my father, I think what will best show you how entirely he\r\n     was a stranger to financial administration, is a simple _résumé_ of\r\n     his career, under Ismaïl, which I shall try to condense into a few\r\n     lines.\r\n\r\n     \"In the very first year of Ismaïl's accession, 1863, Nubar Pasha\r\n     was sent on a mission to Paris to regulate the differences relating\r\n     to the Suez Canal. He remained there two years, and upon his return\r\n     to Egypt he was appointed, first, Minister of Public Works, and\r\n     then, Minister for Foreign Affairs. A year later, in 1866, he went\r\n     once more on a mission to Europe, and remained three years absent.\r\n     It was during this period that he obtained the Firman of 1867,\r\n     granting to Egypt administrative autonomy, the right of making\r\n     Customs Conventions with the Powers, and the title of Khedive for\r\n     the Viceroy. It was at this time, too, that he commenced the first\r\n     negotiations for Judicial Reform with the Powers. He did not return\r\n     to Egypt until 1869, and then for six months only, in order to\r\n     assist at the opening of the Suez Canal, and preside at the\r\n     Commission of Inquiry for Judicial Reform which was sitting at\r\n     Cairo, and he returned to Paris in 1870 to continue there the\r\n     negotiations for the Reform. These negotiations, begun in 1867,\r\n     lasted until 1875, about eight years, during which time Nubar Pasha\r\n     lived almost entirely in Europe, with the exception of short\r\n     intervals of a few months in Egypt. In 1874 he was dismissed by the\r\n     Khedive on account of a difference of opinion relative to the said\r\n     negotiations, and he remained in Europe without employment for a\r\n     year. He was recalled by Ismaïl to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs\r\n     in June, 1875. Six months later, he was again dismissed, January,\r\n     1876. He then remained two years in Europe, exiled, and did not\r\n     return until 1878, when recalled by the Khedive to form the Mixed\r\n     Ministry in conjunction with Sir Rivers Wilson.\"\r\n\r\n     My father declares in his memoirs, which I hope one day to be able\r\n     to publish, that during the fifteen years of Ismaïl's reign, he\r\n     spent twelve in Europe on missions, on leave of absence, or in\r\n     exile. The dates and facts which I have recited above prove the\r\n     accuracy of this statement. During all these absences from Egypt,\r\n     Nubar Pasha, exclusively occupied with his negotiations, could not\r\n     take any part in the interior affairs of the country, about which\r\n     he was not even consulted. Thus, while in Paris in 1869, he learnt\r\n     from M. Béhic, Minister of Public Works to the Emperor Napoleon\r\n     III, in the course of a conversation with him relative to the\r\n     Judicial Reform, that the Khedive had just arranged a loan of ten\r\n     millions sterling, of which my father had not even been informed;\r\n     and again, at Constantinople in 1873, where he was pursuing his\r\n     negotiations for the Reform, it was indirectly that he learned that\r\n     the Khedive was negotiating a fresh loan of thirty millions.\r\n\r\n     You see, Sir, by these facts, which it will be easy for you to\r\n     verify, that not only was my father never Minister of Finance, nor\r\n     connected with the Khedive's loans, but that all his energy, his\r\n     talents and the influence which he had acquired were employed in\r\n     negotiations abroad: (1) for the regulation of the question of the\r\n     Suez Canal, which culminated in the arbitration of Napoleon III,\r\n     through which Egypt obtained a verdict for the abolition of forced\r\n     labour in the making of the Canal; (2) for obtaining Firmans from\r\n     the Sublime Porte; (3) for the Judicial Reform which was his\r\n     conception and his work, and to which he consecrated all his\r\n     energy, his intelligence, and the best years of his life. I must\r\n     also add that he continued to work zealously for the abolition of\r\n     forced labour while Director of Railways and at the Ministry of\r\n     Public Works. This we owe in large measure to him, as Sir W.\r\n     Wilcocks so courteously testifies in his book on the Irrigation of\r\n     Egypt.\r\n\r\n     Do you not think, Sir, that I have a right under these\r\n     circumstances to appeal to your courtesy in asking you to rectify\r\n     in the new edition of your book the erroneous passages which I have\r\n     mentioned? You cannot fail to see the importance which I attach to\r\n     these corrections, for it would not be just, in a work bearing upon\r\n     history, for my father to be held responsible for government\r\n     measures to which he was altogether a stranger.\r\n\r\n     My father in the course of his laborious career made many friends,\r\n     but also many enemies, as all politicians do. His enemies have not\r\n     failed to spread calumnies about him and to invent stories. I will\r\n     only cite two: First, that concerning his nationality. His\r\n     political adversaries, in the interest of their cause, successively\r\n     reproached him with being an English and a German subject! These\r\n     allegations, the object of which was to discredit him in the course\r\n     of his negotiations for Judicial Reform by contesting, though he\r\n     was a Minister of the Khedive, his Egyptian nationality, have been\r\n     since recognized as being without any foundation. Another legend\r\n     relates to his supposed immense fortune. The most calumnious and\r\n     fantastic assertions have been made with regard to this, generally\r\n     by people who were interested in tarnishing the memory of an\r\n     adversary by leaving it to be understood that such great wealth\r\n     could only have been acquired by unlawful means. They did not\r\n     hesitate to say and write that he possessed more than four millions\r\n     sterling. Although I have not condescended up to now to reply to\r\n     calumnies which have appeared in newspapers, there is no reason why\r\n     I should not give you, for your personal information, the precise\r\n     facts and figures.\r\n\r\n     At his death my father left a fortune of £155,000, having settled\r\n     upon my mother during his lifetime a personal fortune amounting to\r\n     an equal sum. Thus the four millions, at which the most moderate\r\n     estimators valued what he possessed, were not in reality more than\r\n     about £300,000. This is a fact which can easily be verified, for\r\n     the Deed of Partition of his inheritance--there being children who\r\n     were minors among the heirs--was registered at the Mixed Tribunal\r\n     at Cairo.\r\n\r\n     It is equally easy to show the sources from which this fortune was\r\n     derived. It consisted of donations, which he had received from the\r\n     Khedive in recompense for services rendered, and of an\r\n     exceptionally fortunate investment of a part of these donations.\r\n\r\n     By the _résumé_ which I have given of his career, you will see the\r\n     importance of the services he rendered to his country and the\r\n     results obtained by his various negotiations. The Khedive did not\r\n     fail to recompense him, as he had recompensed others of his\r\n     Ministers, and as the British Parliament has recently done for Lord\r\n     Cromer by voting him a donation of £50,000. Thus he received, upon\r\n     the successful result of the negotiations relating to the Suez\r\n     Canal, the Firman of 1867 and the Judicial Reform, various\r\n     recompenses consisting of sums of money, of a property of nine\r\n     hundred acres, and of a house in Alexandria--the whole being of the\r\n     value of about £80,000.\r\n\r\n     My father had the fortunate inspiration, at the creation of the\r\n     Cairo Water Company, of which he was President, to invest an\r\n     important part of this sum, £25,000, in shares of the Company; and\r\n     this investment alone sufficed to raise his fortune to the sum I\r\n     have indicated, for it is a matter of public knowledge that the\r\n     Cairo Water Company's shares had gone up to ten times their value\r\n     at the date of Nubar Pasha's death.\r\n\r\n     I will end by begging you to excuse my having written you so long a\r\n     letter, but your offer of rectification proves your anxiety to be\r\n     impartial and has authorized my doing so. Thanking you in advance,\r\n     therefore, for the corrections which my information will enable you\r\n     to make, I beg you will accept, Sir, etc.,\r\n\r\n     BOGHOS NUBAR.\r\n\r\n_Note._--I am glad to have obtained Boghos Pasha's permission to publish\r\nthe whole of this interesting letter, and regret that I cannot, at the\r\nlate date of my receiving it, make any alteration in the text of this\r\nedition, such as he at first suggested. I think, however, that the\r\nletter, published in full, will be found more satisfactory than a mere\r\nomission of the passages it corrects could possibly have been.\r\n\r\nW. S. B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX V\r\n\r\nNOTE AS TO THE BERLIN CONGRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been pointed out by Mr. Lucy, in the _Westminster Gazette_, that\r\nthe account given in the text, page 34, of the quarrel between M.\r\nWaddington and Lord Salisbury, at the Berlin Congress, is manifestly\r\nincorrect, inasmuch as it was the Anglo-Russian agreement of 31st May,\r\nnot the Cyprus Convention with Turkey of 4th June, that was published by\r\nthe _Globe_ newspaper through the instrumentality of Marvin, the Cyprus\r\nConvention being issued in the ordinary way. The confusion between the\r\ntwo instruments in the text is undeniable and needs correction. At the\r\nsame time the result of as full an enquiry as I have been able to make\r\ninto the affair, by a reference to contemporary documents, is not such\r\nas to make me doubt the substantial truth of the story. What seems\r\nprecisely to have happened is this:\r\n\r\nLords Beaconsfield and Salisbury, before entering the Congress, had\r\nconcluded two separate agreements, both secret, regarding Ottoman\r\naffairs--the one with Russia, the other with Turkey. These while\r\nconceding something to Russia, would, they thought, conjointly secure\r\nthe integrity of the Sultan's dominions on the Asiatic side against\r\nfurther aggression. The agreement with Russia recognized her permanent\r\npossession of Batum, but was more than counterbalanced, in their\r\nopinion, by the second Convention, unknown to the Russian Government as\r\nto the rest of the world, guaranteeing the remainder of his Asiatic\r\ndominions under English protection to the Sultan. The two treaties were\r\ndrafted at the Foreign Office almost simultaneously, and by accident or\r\nnegligence that with Russia became known, the very day it was signed, to\r\nM. Charles Marvin, a poor journalist and teacher of languages, who had\r\nbeen taken on as extra Writer for his knowledge of Russian in the Treaty\r\nDepartment at the Foreign Office. Marvin, who was wretchedly underpaid\r\nat the rate of tenpence an hour, had been intrusted with the copying of\r\nthe agreement, and yielded to the temptation of betraying a summary of\r\nit to his employers in the Press. This was on the 31st May, a fortnight\r\nbefore the Congress met.\r\n\r\nFor some days after this Marvin seems to have remained on unsuspected at\r\nthe Foreign Office, it being imagined at first that it was perhaps Count\r\nSchouvalof himself, the Russian ambassador in London, who had given the\r\ninformation to the Press. Later, seeing that the summary was no more\r\nthan a summary, and had appeared in one newspaper only, the _Globe_, it\r\nwas resolved to deny it; and Lord Salisbury had little difficulty in\r\npersuading the House of Lords and the country that it lacked\r\nauthenticity. In answer to a question put to him about it by Lord Grey,\r\nLord Salisbury declared roundly \"the statement to which the noble Earl\r\nrefers, and other statements that have been made that I have seen, are\r\nwholly unauthenticated and are not deserving of the confidence of your\r\nLordship's House.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the incident raised a suspicion of England's good faith\r\nabroad, and, doubtless was the cause of the declaration, mentioned in\r\nthe text, being demanded of the Ambassadors at the first sitting of the\r\nCongress. This must have been subscribed to by Lords Beaconsfield and\r\nSalisbury on the 13th June, the other dates being:\r\n\r\n     The Agreement with Russia, signed in London, 31st May.\r\n\r\n     The _Globe_ summary, published in the evening of the same day, 31st\r\n     May.\r\n\r\n     Lord Salisbury's denial in the House of Lords, 3rd June.\r\n\r\n     First sitting of the Berlin Congress, 13th June.\r\n\r\n     Publication by the _Globe_ of the full text of the Agreement, on\r\n     evening of 14th June.\r\n\r\nLord Beaconsfield's and Lord Salisbury's discomfiture must consequently\r\nhave been still more sudden than in my account of it when the news\r\nbecame public property at Berlin on the 15th; and doubtless the\r\nsensation caused there was primarily on account of the Agreement, not of\r\nthe Convention, which latter was not published till 8th July. All the\r\nsame I still adhere to my recollection of the letter shown me at Simla\r\nthat it was the Cyprus Convention that was the main cause of M.\r\nWaddington's resentment, and of Lord Salisbury's concession to him about\r\nTunis and the rest. That it was so is confirmed to me by a passage in my\r\ndiary of 1884, when, being at Constantinople and having just had a\r\nconversation with Count Corti on the subject, I made the following\r\nentry. It must be remembered that the Count had been Italian ambassador\r\nat the Berlin Congress, and was actually ambassador to the Sultan at the\r\ndate of the conversation; nor was he other than a friendly witness, for\r\nhe was always regarded as an _Anglomane_ and ally of our British\r\ndiplomacy.\r\n\r\n     \"_October 26._ Count Corti came to take us in a steam launch to\r\n     Therapia. We had luncheon with the Wyndhams, and called on the\r\n     Noailles (at the English and French Embassies).... On our way back\r\n     to Constantinople Count Corti entertained us with stories of the\r\n     Berlin Congress and of Lord Salisbury's antics there. Disraeli and\r\n     Salisbury had gone there quite on their high horse to curb the\r\n     territorial ambitions of Russia, and the publication of the secret\r\n     convention for the acquisition of Cyprus was a great shock to\r\n     everybody. Salisbury broke it gently to Waddington before the news\r\n     was published, and Waddington consulted his colleagues, it being\r\n     generally agreed that there was no middle course between going to\r\n     war and saying nothing. 'Il faut la guerre ou se taire.' But the\r\n     publication was a great blow to Disraeli, who took to his bed and\r\n     did not appear for four or five days. Lord Salisbury, however,\r\n     brazened it out, and came to the Congress with an air of defiance.\r\n     There was no rupture between him and Waddington, and they remained\r\n     on apparently friendly terms, but Waddington had his revenge. He\r\n     was sitting one day with Salisbury, and, the conversation leading\r\n     that way, Waddington asked what the English Government would say to\r\n     France taking Tunis, and Salisbury said he did not see the harm.\r\n     Whereupon Waddington communicated this to Paris, and on his return\r\n     the French ambassador in London was instructed to write to Lord\r\n     Salisbury reminding him of his words. Thus Salisbury was caught.\r\n     'But,' said Corti, 'if he had known anything of his business he\r\n     would have declined to answer the note officially and would have\r\n     pleaded a private conversation.' He did not believe that any\r\n     arrangement of _condominium_ was come to between Salisbury and\r\n     Waddington at that time, though I told him, without mentioning\r\n     names, of the letter Lytton had shown me. Corti is interesting\r\n     diplomatically, as he has been to more congresses than any man in\r\n     Europe.\"\r\n\r\nThis entry, which is a contemporary record of Count Corti's recollection\r\nof the incident, five years after it happened, shows that the two secret\r\nagreements had remained closely connected in his mind as the cause of\r\nWaddington's displeasure. They certainly were present in the Duke of\r\nRichmond's mind when, representing the Foreign Office on 17th June, in\r\nanswer to a further question about the authenticity of the full text of\r\nthe Anglo-Russian Agreement, he said \"as an explanation of the policy of\r\nHer Majesty's Government it is _incomplete_ and therefore inaccurate,\"\r\nfor this _incompleteness_ can only be understood as an allusion to the\r\nCyprus Convention in 1878, and the seizure of Tunis by France in 1881,\r\nwhich after all is the important matter. Some day, no doubt, the whole\r\nincident will be made clear by a publication of the secret records at\r\nthe Foreign Office or at the Quai d'Orsay. In the meantime we may accept\r\nit as probable that, finding the Russian Agreement divulged, Lord\r\nSalisbury resolved to make a clean breast also of the other Agreement,\r\nand, in Count Corti's words, broke gently to M. Waddington the existence\r\nalso of a Convention with Turkey. One thing I am certain of in my\r\nrecollection, that the letter shown me at Simla described the quarrel\r\nand the terms obtained in the reconciliation with M. Waddington.\r\n\r\nThe Cyprus Convention was published in London on the 9th July, having\r\nbeen signed on the 4th June, but there is evidence of its having been in\r\nLord Beaconsfield's thoughts at least three months earlier, for Lord\r\nDerby, speaking in the Lords, 18th July, gave it as his reason for\r\nleaving the Cabinet in March that the policy of the Government had\r\nbecome such, that it was already, at that date, being considered\r\nnecessary \"to seize and occupy the island of Cyprus.\"\r\n\r\nW.

But how to say it?\r\n      I have a cause to plead. But to what ears?\r\n    How shall I move a world by lamentation--\r\n      A world which heeded not a Nation's tears?\r\n\r\n    How shall I speak of justice to the aggressors,--\r\n      Of right to Kings whose rights include all wrong,--\r\n    Of truth to Statecraft, true but in deceiving,--\r\n      Of peace to Prelates, pity to the Strong?\r\n\r\n    Where shall I find a hearing? In high places?\r\n      The voice of havock drowns the voice of good.\r\n    On the throne's steps? The elders of the nation\r\n      Rise in their ranks and call aloud for blood.\r\n\r\n    Where? In the street? Alas for the world's reason!\r\n      Not Peers not Priests alone this deed have done.\r\n    The clothes of those high Hebrews stoning Stephen\r\n      Were held by all of us,--ay every one.\r\n\r\n    Yet none the less I speak. Nay, here by Heaven\r\n      This task at least a poet best may do,--\r\n    To stand alone against the mighty many,\r\n      To force a hearing for the weak and few.\r\n\r\n    Unthanked, unhonoured,--yet a task of glory,--\r\n      Not in his day, but in an age more wise,\r\n    When those poor Chancellors have found their portion\r\n      And lie forgotten in their dust of lies.\r\n\r\n    And who shall say that this year's cause of freedom\r\n      Lost on the Nile has not as worthy proved\r\n    Of poet's hymning as the cause which Milton\r\n      Sang in his blindness or which Dante loved?\r\n\r\n    The fall of Guelph beneath the spears of Valois,\r\n      Freedom betrayed, the Ghibelline restored,\r\n    --Have we not seen it, we who caused this anguish,\r\n      Exile and fear proscription and the sword?\r\n\r\n    Or shall God less avenge in their wild valley\r\n      Where they lie slaughtered those poor sheep whose fold\r\n    In the gray twilight of our wrath we harried\r\n      To serve the worshippers of stocks and gold?\r\n\r\n    This fails. That finds its hour. This fights. That falters.\r\n      Greece is stamped out beneath a Wolseley's heels.\r\n    Or Egypt is avenged of her long mourning,\r\n      And hurls her Persians back to their own keels.\r\n\r\n    'Tis not alone the victor who is noble.\r\n      'Tis not alone the wise man who is wise.\r\n    There is a voice of sorrow in all shouting,\r\n      And shame pursues not only him who flies.\r\n\r\n    To fight and conquer--'tis the boast of heroes.\r\n      To fight and fly--of this men do not speak.\r\n    Yet shall there come a day when men shall tremble\r\n      Rather than do misdeeds upon the weak,--\r\n\r\n    --A day when statesmen baffled in their daring\r\n      Shall rather fear to wield the sword in vain\r\n    Than to give back their charge to a hurt nation,\r\n      And own their frailties, and resign their reign,--\r\n\r\n    --A day of wrath when all fame shall remember\r\n      Of this year's work shall be the fall of one\r\n    Who, standing foremost in her paths of virtue,\r\n      Bent a fool's knee at War's red altar stone.\r\n\r\n    And left all virtue beggared in his falling,\r\n      A sign to England of new griefs to come,\r\n    Her priest of peace who sold his creed for glory\r\n      And marched to carnage at the tuck of drum.\r\n\r\n    Therefore I fear not.

But how to say it?\r\n      Out of the East a twilight had been born.\r\n    It was not day. Yet the long night was waning,\r\n      And the spent nations watched it less forlorn.\r\n\r\n    Out of the silence of the joyless ages\r\n      A voice had spoken, such as the first bird\r\n    Speaks to the woods, before the morning wakens,--\r\n      And the World starting to its feet had heard.\r\n\r\n    Men hailed it as a prophecy. Its utterance\r\n      Was in that tongue divine the Orient knew.\r\n    It spoke of hope. Men hailed it as a brother's.\r\n      It spoke of happiness. Men deemed it true.\r\n\r\n    There in the land of Death, where toil is cradled,\r\n      That tearful Nile, unknown to Liberty,\r\n    It spoke in passionate tones of human freedom,\r\n      And of those rights of Man which cannot die,--\r\n\r\n    --Till from the cavern of long fear, whose portals\r\n      Had backward rolled, and hardly yet aloud,\r\n    Men prisoned stole like ghosts and joined the chorus,\r\n      And chaunted trembling, each man in his shroud.\r\n\r\n    Justice and peace, the brotherhood of nations,--\r\n      Love and goodwill of all mankind to man,--\r\n    These were the words they caught and echoed strangely,\r\n      Deeming them portions of some Godlike plan,--\r\n\r\n    A plan thus first to their own land imparted.\r\n      They did not know the irony of Fate,\r\n    The mockery of man's freedom, and the laughter\r\n      Which greets a brother's love from those that hate.\r\n\r\n    Oh for the beauty of hope's dreams! The childhood\r\n      Of that old land, long impotent in pain,\r\n    Cast off its slough of sorrow with its silence,\r\n      And laughed and shouted and grew new again.\r\n\r\n    And in the streets, where still the shade of Pharaoh\r\n      Stalked in his sons, the Mamelukian horde,\r\n    Youth greeted youth with words of exultation\r\n      And shook his chains and clutched as for a sword.\r\n\r\n    Student and merchant,--Jew, and Copt, and Moslem,--\r\n      All whose scarred backs had bent to the same rod,--\r\n    Fired with one mighty thought, their feuds forgotten,\r\n      Stood hand in hand and praising the same God.\r\n\r\n\r\n    III\r\n\r\n    I have a thing to say. But how to say it?\r\n      As in the days of Moses in the land,\r\n    God sent a man of prayer before his people\r\n      To speak to Pharaoh, and to loose his hand.\r\n\r\n    Injustice, that hard step-mother of heroes,\r\n      Had taught him justice. Him the sight of pain\r\n    Moved into anger, and the voice of weeping\r\n      Made his eyes weep as for a comrade slain.\r\n\r\n    A soldier in the bands of his proud masters\r\n      It was his lot to serve. But of his soul\r\n    None owned allegiance save the Lord of Armies.\r\n      No worship from his God's might him cajole.\r\n\r\n    Strict was his service. In the law of Heaven\r\n      He comfort took and patient under wrong.\r\n    And all men loved him for his heart unquailing,\r\n      And for the words of pity on his tongue.\r\n\r\n    Knowledge had come to him in the night-watches,\r\n      And strength with fasting, eloquence with prayer.\r\n    He stood a Judge from God before the strangers,\r\n      The one just man among his people there.\r\n\r\n    Strongly he spoke: \"Now, Heaven be our witness!\r\n      Egypt this day has risen from her sleep.\r\n    She has put off her mourning and her silence.\r\n      It was no law of God that she should weep.\r\n\r\n    \"It was no law of God nor of the Nations\r\n      That in this land, alone of the fair Earth,\r\n    The hand that sowed should reap not of its labour,\r\n      The heart that grieved should profit not of mirth.\r\n\r\n    \"How have we suffered at the hands of strangers,\r\n      Binding their sheaves, and harvesting their wrath!\r\n    Our service has been bitter, and our wages\r\n      Hunger and pain and nakedness and drouth.\r\n\r\n    \"Which of them pitied us? Of all our princes,\r\n      Was there one Sultan listened to our cry?\r\n    Their palaces we built, their tombs, their temples.\r\n      What did they build but tombs for Liberty?\r\n\r\n    \"To live in ignorance, to die by service;\r\n      To pay our tribute and our stripes receive:\r\n    This was the ransom of our toil in Eden,\r\n      This, and our one sad liberty--to grieve.\r\n\r\n    \"We have had enough of strangers and of princes\r\n      Nursed on our knees and lords within our house.\r\n    The bread which they have eaten was our children's,\r\n      For them the feasting and the shame for us.\r\n\r\n    \"The shadow of their palaces, fair dwellings\r\n      Built with our blood and kneaded with our tears,\r\n    Darkens the land with darkness of Gehennem,\r\n      The lust, the crime, the infamy of years.\r\n\r\n    \"Did ye not hear it? From those muffled windows\r\n      A sound of women rises and of mirth.\r\n    These are our daughters--ay our sons--in prison,\r\n      Captives to shame with those who rule the Earth.\r\n\r\n    \"The silent river by those gardens lapping\r\n      To-night receives its burden of new dead,\r\n    A man of age sent home with his lord's wages,\r\n      Stones to his feet, a grave-cloth to his head.\r\n\r\n    \"Walls infamous in beauty, gardens fragrant\r\n      With rose and citron and the scent of blood.\r\n    God shall blot out the memory of all laughter,\r\n      Rather than leave you standing where you stood.\r\n\r\n    \"We have had enough of princes and of strangers,\r\n      Slaves that were Sultans, eunuchs that were kings,\r\n    The shame of Sodom is on all their faces.\r\n      The curse of Cain pursues them, and it clings.\r\n\r\n    \"Is there no virtue? See the pale Greek smiling.\r\n      Virtue for him is as a tale of old.\r\n    Which be his gods? The cent. per cent. in silver.\r\n      His God of gods? The world's creator, Gold.\r\n\r\n    \"The Turk that plunders and the Frank that panders,\r\n      These are our lords who ply with lust and fraud.\r\n    The brothel and the winepress and the dancers\r\n      Are gifts unneeded in the lands of God.\r\n\r\n    \"We need them not.

Oh how to say it!\r\n      One summer morning, at the hour of prayer,\r\n    And in the face of Man and Man's high Maker,\r\n      The thunder of their cannon rent the air.\r\n\r\n    The flames of death were on you and destruction.\r\n      A hail of iron on your heads they poured.\r\n    You fought, you fell, you died until the sunset;\r\n      And then you fled forsaken of the Lord.\r\n\r\n    I care not if you fled. What men call courage\r\n      Is the least noble thing of which they boast.\r\n    Their victors always are great men of valour.\r\n      Find me the valour of the beaten host!\r\n\r\n    It may be you were cowards. Let them prove it,--\r\n      What matter? Were you women in the fight,\r\n    Your courage were the greater that a moment\r\n      You steeled your weakness in the cause of right.\r\n\r\n    Oh I would rather fly with the first craven\r\n      Who flung his arms away in your good cause,\r\n    Than head the hottest charge by England vaunted\r\n      In all the record of her unjust wars.\r\n\r\n    Poor sheep! they scattered you.
