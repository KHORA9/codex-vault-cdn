Their meeting occurs under felicitous conditions, justifying\r\nsincere congratulation and calling for our grateful acknowledgment to a\r\nbeneficent Providence which has so signally blessed and prospered us as a\r\nnation. Peace and good will with all the nations of the earth continue\r\nunbroken.\r\n\r\nA matter of genuine satisfaction is the growing feeling of fraternal regard\r\nand unification of all sections of our country, the incompleteness of which\r\nhas too long delayed realization of the highest blessings of the Union. The\r\nspirit of patriotism is universal and is ever increasing in fervor. The\r\npublic questions which now most engross us are lifted far above either\r\npartisanship, prejudice, or former sectional differences. They affect every\r\npart of our common country alike and permit of no division on ancient\r\nlines. Questions of foreign policy, of revenue, the soundness of the\r\ncurrency, the inviolability of national obligations, the improvement of the\r\npublic service, appeal to the individual conscience of every earnest\r\ncitizen to whatever party he belongs or in whatever section of the country\r\nhe may reside.\r\n\r\nThe extra session of this Congress which closed during July last enacted\r\nimportant legislation, and while its full effect has not yet been realized,\r\nwhat it has already accomplished assures us of its timeliness and wisdom.\r\nTo test its permanent value further time will be required, and the people,\r\nsatisfied with its operation and results thus far, are in no mind to\r\nwithhold from it a fair trial.\r\n\r\nTariff legislation having been settled by the extra session of Congress,\r\nthe question next pressing for consideration is that of the currency.\r\n\r\nThe work of putting our finances upon a sound basis, difficult as it may\r\nseem, will appear easier when we recall the financial operations of the\r\nGovernment since 1866. On the 30th day of June of that year we had\r\noutstanding demand liabilities in the sum of $728,868,447.41. On the 1st of\r\nJanuary, 1879, these liabilities had been reduced to $443,889,495.88. Of our\r\ninterest-bearing obligations, the figures are even more striking. On July\r\n1, 1866, the principal of the interest-bearing debt of the Government was\r\n$2,332,331,208. On the 1st day of July, 1893, this sum had been reduced to\r\n$585,137,100, or an aggregate reduction of $1,747,294,108. The\r\ninterest-bearing debt of the United States on the 1st day of December,\r\n1897, was $847,365,620. The Government money now outstanding (December 1)\r\nconsists of $346,681,016 of United States notes, $107,793,280 of Treasury\r\nnotes issued by authority of the law of 1890, $384,963,504 of silver\r\ncertificates, and $61,280,761 of standard silver dollars.\r\n\r\nWith the great resources of the Government, and with the honorable example\r\nof the past before us, we ought not to hesitate to enter upon a currency\r\nrevision which will make our demand obligations less onerous to the\r\nGovernment and relieve our financial laws from ambiguity and doubt.\r\n\r\nThe brief review of what was accomplished from the close of the war to\r\n1893, makes unreasonable and groundless any distrust either of our\r\nfinancial ability or soundness; while the situation from 1893 to 1897 must\r\nadmonish Congress of the immediate necessity of so legislating as to make\r\nthe return of the conditions then prevailing impossible.\r\n\r\nThere are many plans proposed as a remedy for the evil. Before we can find\r\nthe true remedy we must appreciate the real evil. It is not that our\r\ncurrency of every kind is not good, for every dollar of it is good; good\r\nbecause the Government's pledge is out to keep it so, and that pledge will\r\nnot be broken. However, the guaranty of our purpose to keep the pledge will\r\nbe best shown by advancing toward its fulfillment.\r\n\r\nThe evil of the present system is found in the great cost to the Government\r\nof maintaining the parity of our different forms of money, that is, keeping\r\nall of them at par with gold. We surely cannot be longer heedless of the\r\nburden this imposes upon the people, even under fairly prosperous\r\nconditions, while the past four years have demonstrated that it is not only\r\nan expensive charge upon the Government, but a dangerous menace to the\r\nNational credit.\r\n\r\nIt is manifest that we must devise some plan to protect the Government\r\nagainst bond issues for repeated redemptions. We must either curtail the\r\nopportunity for speculation, made easy by the multiplied redemptions of our\r\ndemand obligations, or increase the gold reserve for their redemption. We\r\nhave $900,000,000 of currency which the Government by solemn enactment has\r\nundertaken to keep at par with gold. Nobody is obliged to redeem in gold\r\nbut the Government. The banks are not required to redeem in gold. The\r\nGovernment is obliged to keep equal with gold all its outstanding currency\r\nand coin obligations, while its receipts are not required to be paid in\r\ngold. They are paid in every kind of money but gold, and the only means by\r\nwhich the Government can with certainty get gold is by borrowing. It can\r\nget it in no other way when it most needs it. The Government without any\r\nfixed gold revenue is pledged to maintain gold redemption, which it has\r\nsteadily and faithfully done, and which, under the authority now given, it\r\nwill continue to do.\r\n\r\nThe law which requires the Government, after having redeemed its United\r\nStates notes, to pay them out again as current funds, demands a constant\r\nreplenishment of the gold reserve. This is especially so in times of\r\nbusiness panic and when the revenues are insufficient to meet the expenses\r\nof the Government. At such times the Government has no other way to supply\r\nits deficit and maintain redemption but through the increase of its bonded\r\ndebt, as during the Administration of my predecessor, when $262,315,400 of\r\nfour-and-a-half per cent bonds were issued and sold and the proceeds used\r\nto pay the expenses of the Government in excess of the revenues and sustain\r\nthe gold reserve. While it is true that the greater part of the proceeds of\r\nthese bonds were used to supply deficient revenues, a considerable portion\r\nwas required to maintain the gold reserve.\r\n\r\nWith our revenues equal to our expenses, there would be no deficit\r\nrequiring the issuance of bonds. But if the gold reserve falls below\r\n$100,000,000, how will it be replenished except by selling more bonds? Is\r\nthere any other way practicable under existing law? The serious question\r\nthen is, Shall we continue the policy that has been pursued in the past;\r\nthat is, when the gold reserve reaches the point of danger, issue more\r\nbonds and supply the needed gold, or shall we provide other means to\r\nprevent these recurring drains upon the gold reserve? If no further\r\nlegislation is had and the policy of selling bonds is to be continued, then\r\nCongress should give the Secretary of the Treasury authority to sell bonds\r\nat long or short periods, bearing a less rate of interest than is now\r\nauthorized by law.\r\n\r\nI earnestly recommend, as soon as the receipts of the Government are quite\r\nsufficient to pay all the expenses of the Government, that when any of the\r\nUnited States notes are presented for redemption in gold and are redeemed\r\nin gold, such notes shall be kept and set apart, and only paid out in\r\nexchange for gold. This is an obvious duty. If the holder of the United\r\nStates note prefers the gold and gets it from the Government, he should not\r\nreceive back from the Government a United States note without paying gold\r\nin exchange for it. The reason for this is made all the more apparent when\r\nthe Government issues an interest-bearing debt to provide gold for the\r\nredemption of United States notes--a non-interest-bearing debt. Surely it\r\nshould not pay them out again except on demand and for gold. If they are\r\nput out in any other way, they may return again to be followed by another\r\nbond issue to redeem them--another interest-bearing debt to redeem a\r\nnon-interest-bearing debt.\r\n\r\nIn my view, it is of the utmost importance that the Government should be\r\nrelieved from the burden of providing all the gold required for exchanges\r\nand export. This responsibility is alone borne by the Government, without\r\nany of the usual and necessary banking powers to help itself. The banks do\r\nnot feel the strain of gold redemption. The whole strain rests upon the\r\nGovernment, and the size of the gold reserve in the Treasury has come to\r\nbe, with or without reason, the signal of danger or of security. This ought\r\nto be stopped.\r\n\r\nIf we are to have an era of prosperity in the country, with sufficient\r\nreceipts for the expenses of the Government, we may feel no immediate\r\nembarrassment from our present currency; but the danger still exists, and\r\nwill be ever present, menacing us so long as the existing system continues.\r\nAnd, besides, it is in times of adequate revenues and business tranquillity\r\nthat the Government should prepare for the worst. We cannot avoid, without\r\nserious consequences, the wise consideration and prompt solution of this\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury has outlined a plan, in great detail, for the\r\npurpose of removing the threatened recurrence of a depleted gold reserve\r\nand save us from future embarrassment on that account. To this plan I\r\ninvite your careful consideration.\r\n\r\nI concur with the Secretary of the Treasury in his recommendation that\r\nNational banks be allowed to issue notes to the face value of the bonds\r\nwhich they have deposited for circulation, and that the tax on circulating\r\nnotes secured by deposit of such bonds be reduced to one-half of one per\r\ncent per annum. I also join him in recommending that authority be given for\r\nthe establishment of National banks with a minimum capital of $25,000. This\r\nwill enable the smaller villages and agricultural regions of the country to\r\nbe supplied with currency to meet their needs.\r\n\r\nI recommend that the issue of National bank notes be restricted to the\r\ndenomination of ten dollars and upwards. If the suggestions I have herein\r\nmade shall have the approval of Congress, then I would recommend that\r\nNational banks be required to redeem their notes in gold.\r\n\r\nThe most important problem with which this Government is now called upon to\r\ndeal pertaining to its foreign relations concerns its duty toward Spain and\r\nthe Cuban insurrection. Problems and conditions more or less in common with\r\nthose now existing have confronted this Government at various times in the\r\npast. The story of Cuba for many years has been one of unrest, growing\r\ndiscontent, an effort toward a larger enjoyment of liberty and\r\nself-control, of organized resistance to the mother country, of depression\r\nafter distress and warfare, and of ineffectual settlement to be followed by\r\nrenewed revolt. For no enduring period since the enfranchisement of the\r\ncontinental possessions of Spain in the Western Continent has the condition\r\nof Cuba or the policy of Spain toward Cuba not caused concern to the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThe prospect from time to time that the weakness of Spain's hold upon the\r\nisland and the political vicissitudes and embarrassments of the home\r\nGovernment might lead to the transfer of Cuba to a continental power called\r\nforth between 1823 and 1860 various emphatic declarations of the policy of\r\nthe United States to permit no disturbance of Cuba's connection with Spain\r\nunless in the direction of independence or acquisition by us through\r\npurchase, nor has there been any change of this declared policy since upon\r\nthe part of the Government.\r\n\r\nThe revolution which began in 1868 lasted for ten years despite the\r\nstrenuous efforts of the successive peninsular governments to suppress it.\r\nThen as now the Government of the United States testified its grave concern\r\nand offered its aid to put an end to bloodshed in Cuba. The overtures made\r\nby General Grant were refused and the war dragged on, entailing great loss\r\nof life and treasure and increased injury to American interests, besides\r\nthrowing enhanced burdens of neutrality upon this Government. In 1878 peace\r\nwas brought about by the truce of Zanjon, obtained by negotiations between\r\nthe Spanish commander, Martinez de Campos, and the insurgent leaders.\r\n\r\nThe present insurrection broke out in February, 1895. It is not my purpose\r\nat this time to recall its remarkable increase or to characterize its\r\ntenacious resistance against the enormous forces massed against it by\r\nSpain. The revolt and the efforts to subdue it carried destruction to every\r\nquarter of the island, developing wide proportions and defying the efforts\r\nof Spain for its suppression. The civilized code of war has been\r\ndisregarded, no less so by the Spaniards than by the Cubans.\r\n\r\nThe existing conditions can not but fill this Government and the American\r\npeople with the gravest apprehension. There is no desire on the part of our\r\npeople to profit by the misfortunes of Spain. We have only the desire to\r\nsee the Cubans prosperous and contented, enjoying that measure of\r\nself-control which is the inalienable right of man, protected in their\r\nright to reap the benefit of the exhaustless treasures of their country.\r\n\r\nThe offer made by my predecessor in April, 1896, tendering the friendly\r\noffices of this Government, failed. Any mediation on our part was not\r\naccepted. In brief, the answer read: \"There is no effectual way to pacify\r\nCuba unless it begins with the actual submission of the rebels to the\r\nmother country.\" Then only could Spain act in the promised direction, of\r\nher own motion and after her own plans.\r\n\r\nThe cruel policy of concentration was initiated February 16, 1896. The\r\nproductive districts controlled by the Spanish armies were depopulated. The\r\nagricultural inhabitants were herded in and about the garrison towns, their\r\nlands laid waste and their dwellings destroyed. This policy the late\r\ncabinet of Spain justified as a necessary measure of war and as a means of\r\ncutting off supplies from the insurgents. It has utterly failed as a war\r\nmeasure. It was not civilized warfare. It was extermination.\r\n\r\nAgainst this abuse of the rights of war I have felt constrained on repeated\r\noccasions to enter the firm and earnest protest of this Government. There\r\nwas much of public condemnation of the treatment of American citizens by\r\nalleged illegal arrests and long imprisonment awaiting trial or pending\r\nprotracted judicial proceedings. I felt it my first duty to make instant\r\ndemand for the release or speedy trial of all American citizens under\r\narrest. Before the change of the Spanish cabinet in October last twenty-two\r\nprisoners, citizens of the United States, had been given their freedom.\r\n\r\nFor the relief of our own citizens suffering because of the conflict the\r\naid of Congress was sought in a special message, and under the\r\nappropriation of May 24, 1897, effective aid has been given to American\r\ncitizens in Cuba, many of them at their own request having been returned to\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nThe instructions given to our new minister to Spain before his departure\r\nfor his post directed him to impress upon that Government the sincere wish\r\nof the United States to lend its aid toward the ending of the war in Cuba\r\nby reaching a peaceful and lasting result, just and honorable alike to\r\nSpain and to the Cuban people. These instructions recited the character and\r\nduration of the contest, the widespread losses it entails, the burdens and\r\nrestraints it imposes upon us, with constant disturbance of national\r\ninterests, and the injury resulting from an indefinite continuance of this\r\nstate of things. It was stated that at this juncture our Government was\r\nconstrained to seriously inquire if the time was not ripe when Spain of her\r\nown volition, moved by her own interests and every sentiment of humanity,\r\nshould put a stop to this destructive war and make proposals of settlement\r\nhonorable to herself and just to her Cuban colony. It was urged that as a\r\nneighboring nation, with large interests in Cuba, we could be required to\r\nwait only a reasonable time for the mother country to establish its\r\nauthority and restore peace and order within the borders of the island;\r\nthat we could not contemplate an indefinite period for the accomplishment\r\nof this result.\r\n\r\nNo solution was proposed to which the slightest idea of humiliation to\r\nSpain could attach, and, indeed, precise proposals were withheld to avoid\r\nembarrassment to that Government. All that was asked or expected was that\r\nsome safe way might be speedily provided and permanent peace restored. It\r\nso chanced that the consideration of this offer, addressed to the same\r\nSpanish administration which had declined the tenders of my predecessor,\r\nand which for more than two years had poured men and treasure into Cuba in\r\nthe fruitless effort to suppress the revolt, fell to others. Between the\r\ndeparture of General Woodford, the new envoy, and his arrival in Spain the\r\nstatesman who had shaped the policy of his country fell by the hand of an\r\nassassin, and although the cabinet of the late premier still held office\r\nand received from our envoy the proposals he bore, that cabinet gave place\r\nwithin a few days thereafter to a new administration, under the leadership\r\nof Sagasta.\r\n\r\nThe reply to our note was received on the 23d day of October. It is in the\r\ndirection of a better understanding. It appreciates the friendly purposes\r\nof this Government. It admits that our country is deeply affected by the\r\nwar in Cuba and that its desires for peace are just. It declares that the\r\npresent Spanish government is bound by every consideration to a change of\r\npolicy that should satisfy the United States and pacify Cuba within a\r\nreasonable time. To this end Spain has decided to put into effect the\r\npolitical reforms heretofore advocated by the present premier, without\r\nhalting for any consideration in the path which in its judgment leads to\r\npeace. The military operations, it is said, will continue, but will be\r\nhumane and conducted with all regard for private rights, being accompanied\r\nby political action leading to the autonomy of Cuba while guarding Spanish\r\nsovereignty. This, it is claimed, will result in investing Cuba with a\r\ndistinct personality, the island to be governed by an executive and by a\r\nlocal council or chamber, reserving to Spain the control of the foreign\r\nrelations, the army and navy, and the judicial administration. To\r\naccomplish this the present government proposes to modify existing\r\nlegislation by decree, leaving the Spanish Cortes, with the aid of Cuban\r\nsenators and deputies, to solve the economic problem and properly\r\ndistribute the existing debt.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of a declaration of the measures that this Government\r\nproposes to take in carrying out its proffer of good offices, it suggests\r\nthat Spain be left free to conduct military operations and grant political\r\nreforms, while the United States for its part shall enforce its neutral\r\nobligations and cut off the assistance which it is asserted the insurgents\r\nreceive from this country. The supposition of an indefinite prolongation of\r\nthe war is denied. It is asserted that the western provinces are already\r\nwell-nigh reclaimed, that the planting of cane and tobacco therein has been\r\nresumed, and that by force of arms and new and ample reforms very early and\r\ncomplete pacification is hoped for.\r\n\r\nThe immediate amelioration of existing conditions under the new\r\nadministration of Cuban affairs is predicted, and therewithal the\r\ndisturbance and all occasion for any change of attitude on the part of the\r\nUnited States. Discussion of the question of the international duties and\r\nresponsibilities of the United States as Spain understands them is\r\npresented, with an apparent disposition to charge us with failure in this\r\nregard. This charge is without any basis in fact. It could not have been\r\nmade if Spain had been cognizant of the constant efforts this Government\r\nhas made, at the cost of millions and by the employment of the\r\nadministrative machinery of the nation at command, to perform its full duty\r\naccording to the law of nations. That it has successfully prevented the\r\ndeparture of a single military expedition or armed vessel from our shores\r\nin violation of our laws would seem to be a sufficient answer. But of this\r\naspect of the Spanish note it is not necessary to speak further now. Firm\r\nin the conviction of a wholly performed obligation, due response to this\r\ncharge has been made in diplomatic course.\r\n\r\nThroughout all these horrors and dangers to our own peace this Government\r\nhas never in any way abrogated its sovereign prerogative of reserving to\r\nitself the determination of its policy and course according to its own high\r\nsense of right and in consonance with the dearest interests and convictions\r\nof our own people should the prolongation of the strife so demand.\r\n\r\nOf the untried measures there remain only: Recognition of the insurgents as\r\nbelligerents; recognition of the independence of Cuba; neutral intervention\r\nto end the war by imposing a rational compromise between the contestants,\r\nand intervention in favor of one or the other party. I speak not of\r\nforcible annexation, for that can not be thought of. That, by our code of\r\nmorality, would be criminal aggression.\r\n\r\nRecognition of the belligerency of the Cuban insurgents has often been\r\ncanvassed as a possible, if not inevitable, step both in regard to the\r\nprevious ten years' struggle and during the present war. I am not unmindful\r\nthat the two Houses of Congress in the spring of 1896 expressed the opinion\r\nby concurrent resolution that a condition of public war existed requiring\r\nor justifying the recognition of a state of belligerency in Cuba, and\r\nduring the extra session the Senate voted a joint resolution of like\r\nimport, which, however, was not brought to a vote in the House of\r\nRepresentatives. In the presence of these significant expressions of the\r\nsentiment of the legislative branch it behooves the Executive to soberly\r\nconsider the conditions under which so important a measure must needs rest\r\nfor justification. It is to be seriously considered whether the Cuban\r\ninsurrection possesses beyond dispute the attributes of statehood, which\r\nalone can demand the recognition of belligerency in its favor. Possession,\r\nin short, of the essential qualifications of sovereignty by the insurgents\r\nand the conduct of the war by them according to the received code of war\r\nare no less important factors toward the determination of the problem of\r\nbelligerency than are the influences and consequences of the struggle upon\r\nthe internal polity of the recognizing state.\r\n\r\nThe wise utterances of President Grant in his memorable message of December\r\n7, 1875, are signally relevant to the present situation in Cuba, and it may\r\nbe wholesome now to recall them. At that time a ruinous conflict had for\r\nseven years wasted the neighboring island. During all those years an utter\r\ndisregard of the laws of civilized warfare and of the just demands of\r\nhumanity, which called forth expressions of condemnation from the nations\r\nof Christendom, continued unabated. Desolation and ruin pervaded that\r\nproductive region, enormously affecting the commerce of all commercial\r\nnations, but that of the United States more than any other by reason of\r\nproximity and larger trade and intercourse. At that juncture General Grant\r\nuttered these words, which now, as then, sum up the elements of the\r\nproblem: A recognition of the independence of Cuba being, in my opinion,\r\nimpracticable and indefensible, the question which next presents itself is\r\nthat of the recognition of belligerent rights in the parties to the\r\ncontest.\r\n\r\nIn a former message to Congress I had occasion to consider this question,\r\nand reached the conclusion that the conflict in Cuba, dreadful and\r\ndevastating as were its incidents, did not rise to the fearful dignity of\r\nwar. It is possible that the acts of foreign powers, and even acts of Spain\r\nherself, of this very nature, might be pointed to in defense of such\r\nrecognition. But now, as in its past history, the United States should\r\ncarefully avoid the false lights which might lead it into the mazes of\r\ndoubtful law and of questionable propriety, and adhere rigidly and sternly\r\nto the rule, which has been its guide, of doing only that which is right\r\nand honest and of good report. The question of according or of withholding\r\nrights of belligerency must be judged in every case in view of the\r\nparticular attending facts. Unless justified by necessity, it is always,\r\nand justly, regarded as an unfriendly act and a gratuitous demonstration of\r\nmoral support to the rebellion. It is necessary, and it is required, when\r\nthe interests and rights of another government or of its people are so far\r\naffected by a pending civil conflict as to require a definition of its\r\nrelations to the parties thereto. But this conflict must be one which will\r\nbe recognized in the sense of international law as war. Belligerence, too,\r\nis a fact. The mere existence of contending armed bodies and their\r\noccasional conflicts do not constitute war in the sense referred to.\r\nApplying to the existing condition of affairs in Cuba the tests recognized\r\nby publicists and writers on international law, and which have been\r\nobserved by nations of dignity, honesty, and power when free from sensitive\r\nor selfish and unworthy motives, I fail to find in the insurrection the\r\nexistence of such a substantial political organization, real, palpable, and\r\nmanifest to the world, having the forms and capable of the ordinary\r\nfunctions of government toward its own people and to other states, with\r\ncourts for the administration of justice, with a local habitation,\r\npossessing such organization of force, such material, such occupation of\r\nterritory, as to take the contest out of the category of a mere rebellious\r\ninsurrection or occasional skirmishes and place it on the terrible footing\r\nof war, to which a recognition of belligerency would aim to elevate it. The\r\ncontest, moreover, is solely on land; the insurrection has not possessed\r\nitself of a single seaport whence it may send forth its flag, nor has it\r\nany means of communication with foreign powers except through the military\r\nlines of its adversaries. No apprehension of any of those sudden and\r\ndifficult complications which a war upon the ocean is apt to precipitate\r\nupon the vessels, both commercial and national, and upon the consular\r\nofficers of other powers calls for the definition of their relations to the\r\nparties to the contest. Considered as a question of expediency, I regard\r\nthe accordance of belligerent rights still to be as unwise and premature as\r\nI regard it to be, at present, indefensible as a measure of right. Such\r\nrecognition entails upon the country according the rights which flow from\r\nit difficult and complicated duties, and requires the exaction from the\r\ncontending parties of the strict observance of their rights and\r\nobligations. It confers the right of search upon the high seas by vessels\r\nof both parties; it would subject the carrying of arms and munitions of\r\nwar, which now may be transported freely and without interruption in the\r\nvessels of the United States, to detention and to possible seizure; it\r\nwould give rise to countless vexatious questions, would release the parent\r\nGovernment from responsibility for acts done by the insurgents, and would\r\ninvest Spain with the right to exercise the supervision recognized by our\r\ntreaty of 1795 over our commerce on the high seas, a very large part of\r\nwhich, in its traffic between the Atlantic and the Gulf States and between\r\nall of them and the States on the Pacific, passes through the waters which\r\nwash the shores of Cuba. The exercise of this supervision could scarce fail\r\nto lead, if not to abuses, certainly to collisions perilous to the peaceful\r\nrelations of the two States. There can be little doubt to what result such\r\nsupervision would before long draw this nation. It would be unworthy of the\r\nUnited States to inaugurate the possibilities of such result by measures of\r\nquestionable right or expediency or by any indirection. Turning to the\r\npractical aspects of a recognition of belligerency and reviewing its\r\ninconveniences and positive dangers, still further pertinent considerations\r\nappear. In the code of nations there is no such thing as a naked\r\nrecognition of belligerency, unaccompanied by the assumption of\r\ninternational neutrality. Such recognition, without more, will not confer\r\nupon either party to a domestic conflict a status not theretofore actually\r\npossessed or affect the relation of either party to other states. The act\r\nof recognition usually takes the form of a solemn proclamation of\r\nneutrality, which recites the de facto condition of belligerency as its\r\nmotive. It announces a domestic law of neutrality in the declaring state.\r\nIt assumes the international obligations of a neutral in the presence of a\r\npublic state of war. It warns all citizens and others within the\r\njurisdiction of the proclaimant that they violate those rigorous\r\nobligations at their own peril and can not expect to be shielded from the\r\nconsequences. The right of visit and search on the seas and seizure of\r\nvessels and cargoes and contraband of war and good prize under admiralty\r\nlaw must under international law be admitted as a legitimate consequence of\r\na proclamation of belligerency. While according the equal belligerent\r\nrights defined by public law to each party in our ports disfavors would be\r\nimposed on both, which, while nominally equal, would weigh heavily in\r\nbehalf of Spain herself. Possessing a navy and controlling the ports of\r\nCuba, her maritime rights could be asserted not only for the military\r\ninvestment of the island, but up to the margin of our own territorial\r\nwaters, and a condition of things would exist for which the Cubans within\r\ntheir own domain could not hope to create a parallel, while its creation\r\nthrough aid or sympathy from within our domain would be even more\r\nimpossible than now, with the additional obligations of international\r\nneutrality we would perforce assume.\r\n\r\nThe enforcement of this enlarged and onerous code of neutrality would only\r\nbe influential within our own jurisdiction by land and sea and applicable\r\nby our own instrumentalities. It could impart to the United States no\r\njurisdiction between Spain and the insurgents. It would give the United\r\nStates no right of intervention to enforce the conduct of the strife within\r\nthe paramount authority of Spain according to the international code of\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons I regard the recognition of the belligerency of the Cuban\r\ninsurgents as now unwise, and therefore inadmissible. Should that step\r\nhereafter be deemed wise as a measure of right and duty, the Executive will\r\ntake it.\r\n\r\nIntervention upon humanitarian grounds has been frequently suggested and\r\nhas not failed to receive my most anxious and earnest consideration. But\r\nshould such a step be now taken, when it is apparent that a hopeful change\r\nhas supervened in the policy of Spain toward Cuba? A new government has\r\ntaken office in the mother country. It is pledged in advance to the\r\ndeclaration that all the effort in the world can not suffice to maintain\r\npeace in Cuba by the bayonet; that vague promises of reform after\r\nsubjugation afford no solution of the insular problem; that with a\r\nsubstitution of commanders must come a change of the past system of warfare\r\nfor one in harmony with a new policy, which shall no longer aim to drive\r\nthe Cubans to the \"horrible alternative of taking to the thicket or\r\nsuccumbing in misery;\" that reforms must be instituted in accordance with\r\nthe needs and circumstances of the time, and that these reforms, while\r\ndesigned to give full autonomy to the colony and to create a virtual entity\r\nand self-controlled administration, shall yet conserve and affirm the\r\nsovereignty of Spain by a just distribution of powers and burdens upon a\r\nbasis of mutual interest untainted by methods of selfish expediency.\r\n\r\nThe first acts of the new government lie in these honorable paths. The\r\npolicy of cruel rapine and extermination that so long shocked the universal\r\nsentiment of humanity has been reversed. Under the new military commander a\r\nbroad clemency is proffered. Measures have already been set on foot to\r\nrelieve the horrors of starvation. The power of the Spanish armies, it is\r\nasserted, is to be used not to spread ruin and desolation, but to protect\r\nthe resumption of peaceful agricultural pursuits and productive industries.\r\nThat past methods are futile to force a peace by subjugation is freely\r\nadmitted, and that ruin without conciliation must inevitably fail to win\r\nfor Spain the fidelity of a contented dependency.\r\n\r\nDecrees in application of the foreshadowed reforms have already been\r\npromulgated. The full text of these decrees has not been received, but as\r\nfurnished in a telegraphic summary from our minister are: All civil and\r\nelectoral rights of peninsular Spaniards are, in virtue of existing\r\nconstitutional authority, forthwith extended to colonial Spaniards. A\r\nscheme of autonomy has been proclaimed by decree, to become effective upon\r\nratification by the Cortes. It creates a Cuban parliament, which, with the\r\ninsular executive, can consider and vote upon all subjects affecting local\r\norder and interests, possessing unlimited powers save as to matters of\r\nstate, war, and the navy, as to which the Governor-General acts by his own\r\nauthority as the delegate of the central Government. This parliament\r\nreceives the oath of the Governor-General to preserve faithfully the\r\nliberties and privileges of the colony, and to it the colonial secretaries\r\nare responsible. It has the right to propose to the central Government,\r\nthrough the Governor-General, modifications of the national charter and to\r\ninvite new projects of law or executive measures in the interest of the\r\ncolony.\r\n\r\nBesides its local powers, it is competent, first, to regulate electoral\r\nregistration and procedure and prescribe the qualifications of electors and\r\nthe manner of exercising suffrage; second, to organize courts of justice\r\nwith native judges from members of the local bar; third, to frame the\r\ninsular budget, both as to expenditures and revenues, without limitation of\r\nany kind, and to set apart the revenues to meet the Cuban share of the\r\nnational budget, which latter will be voted by the national Cortes with the\r\nassistance of Cuban senators and deputies; fourth, to initiate or take part\r\nin the negotiations of the national Government for commercial treaties\r\nwhich may affect Cuban interests; fifth, to accept or reject commercial\r\ntreaties which the national Government may have concluded without the\r\nparticipation of the Cuban government; sixth, to frame the colonial tariff,\r\nacting in accord with the peninsular Government in scheduling articles of\r\nmutual commerce between the mother country and the colonies. Before\r\nintroducing or voting upon a bill the Cuban government or the chambers will\r\nlay the project before the central Government and hear its opinion thereon,\r\nall the correspondence in such regard being made public. Finally, all\r\nconflicts of jurisdiction arising between the different municipal,\r\nprovincial, and insular assemblies, or between the latter and the insular\r\nexecutive power, and which from their nature may not be referable to the\r\ncentral Government for decision, shall be submitted to the courts.\r\n\r\nThat the government of Sagasta has entered upon a course from which\r\nrecession with honor is impossible can hardly be questioned; that in the\r\nfew weeks it has existed it has made earnest of the sincerity of its\r\nprofessions is undeniable. I shall not impugn its sincerity, nor should\r\nimpatience be suffered to embarrass it in the task it has undertaken. It is\r\nhonestly due to Spain and to our friendly relations with Spain that she\r\nshould be given a reasonable chance to realize her expectations and to\r\nprove the asserted efficacy of the new order of things to which she stands\r\nirrevocably committed. She has recalled the commander whose brutal orders\r\ninflamed the American mind and shocked the civilized world. She has\r\nmodified the horrible order of concentration and has undertaken to care for\r\nthe helpless and permit those who desire to resume the cultivation of their\r\nfields to do so, and assures them of the protection of the Spanish\r\nGovernment in their lawful occupations. She has just released the\r\nCompetitor prisoners, heretofore sentenced to death, and who have been the\r\nsubject of repeated diplomatic correspondence during both this and the\r\npreceding Administration.\r\n\r\nNot a single American citizen is now in arrest or confinement in Cuba of\r\nwhom this Government has any knowledge. The near future will demonstrate\r\nwhether the indispensable condition of a righteous peace, just alike to the\r\nCubans and to Spain as well as equitable to all our interests so intimately\r\ninvolved in the welfare of Cuba, is likely to be attained. If not, the\r\nexigency of further and other action by the United States will remain to be\r\ntaken. When that time comes that action will be determined in the line of\r\nindisputable right and duty. It will be faced, without misgiving or\r\nhesitancy in the light of the obligation this Government owes to itself, to\r\nthe people who have confided to it the protection of their interests and\r\nhonor, and to humanity.\r\n\r\nSure of the right, keeping free from all offense ourselves, actuated only\r\nby upright and patriotic considerations, moved neither by passion nor\r\nselfishness, the Government will continue its watchful care over the rights\r\nand property of American citizens and will abate none of its efforts to\r\nbring about by peaceful agencies a peace which shall be honorable and\r\nenduring. If it shall hereafter appear to be a duty imposed by our\r\nobligations to ourselves, to civilization and humanity to intervene with\r\nforce, it shall be without fault on our part and only because the necessity\r\nfor such action will be so clear as to command the support and approval of\r\nthe civilized world.\r\n\r\nBy a special message dated the 16th day of June last, I laid before the\r\nSenate a treaty signed that day by the plenipotentiaries of the United\r\nStates and of the Republic of Hawaii, having for its purpose the\r\nincorporation of the Hawaiian Islands as an integral part of the United\r\nStates and under its sovereignty. The Senate having removed the injunction\r\nof secrecy, although the treaty is still pending before that body, the\r\nsubject may be properly referred to in this Message because the necessary\r\naction of the Congress is required to determine by legislation many details\r\nof the eventual union should the fact of annexation be accomplished, as I\r\nbelieve it should be.\r\n\r\nWhile consistently disavowing from a very early period any aggressive\r\npolicy of absorption in regard to the Hawaiian group, a long series of\r\ndeclarations through three-quarters of a century has proclaimed the vital\r\ninterest of the United States in the independent life of the Islands and\r\ntheir intimate commercial dependence upon this country. At the same time it\r\nhas been repeatedly asserted that in no event could the entity of Hawaiian\r\nstatehood cease by the passage of the Islands under the domination or\r\ninfluence of another power than the United States. Under these\r\ncircumstances, the logic of events required that annexation, heretofore\r\noffered but declined, should in the ripeness of time come about as the\r\nnatural result of the strengthening ties that bind us to those Islands, and\r\nbe realized by the free will of the Hawaiian State.\r\n\r\nThat treaty was unanimously ratified without amendment by the Senate and\r\nPresident of the Republic of Hawaii on the 10th of September last, and only\r\nawaits the favorable action of the American Senate to effect the complete\r\nabsorption of the Islands into the domain of the United States. What the\r\nconditions of such a union shall be, the political relation thereof to the\r\nUnited States, the character of the local administration, the quality and\r\ndegree of the elective franchise of the inhabitants, the extension of the\r\nfederal laws to the territory or the enactment of special laws to fit the\r\npeculiar condition thereof, the regulation if need be of the labor system\r\ntherein, are all matters which the treaty has wisely relegated to the\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nIf the treaty is confirmed as every consideration of dignity and honor\r\nrequires, the wisdom of Congress will see to it that, avoiding abrupt\r\nassimilation of elements perhaps hardly yet fitted to share in the highest\r\nfranchises of citizenship, and having due regard to the geographical\r\nconditions, the most just provisions for self-rule in local matters with\r\nthe largest political liberties as an integral part of our Nation will be\r\naccorded to the Hawaiians. No less is due to a people who, after nearly\r\nfive years of demonstrated capacity to fulfill the obligations of\r\nself-governing statehood, come of their free will to merge their destinies\r\nin our body-politic.\r\n\r\nThe questions which have arisen between Japan and Hawaii by reason of the\r\ntreatment of Japanese laborers emigrating to the Islands under the\r\nHawaiian-Japanese convention of 1888, are in a satisfactory stage of\r\nsettlement by negotiation. This Government has not been invited to mediate,\r\nand on the other hand has sought no intervention in that matter, further\r\nthan to evince its kindliest disposition toward such a speedy and direct\r\nadjustment by the two sovereign States in interest as shall comport with\r\nequity and honor. It is gratifying to learn that the apprehensions at first\r\ndisplayed on the part of Japan lest the cessation of Hawaii's national life\r\nthrough annexation might impair privileges to which Japan honorably laid\r\nclaim, have given place to confidence in the uprightness of this\r\nGovernment, and in the sincerity of its purpose to deal with all possible\r\nulterior questions in the broadest spirit of friendliness.\r\n\r\nAs to the representation of this Government to Nicaragua, Salvador, and\r\nCosta Rica, I have concluded that Mr. William L. Merry, confirmed as\r\nminister of the United States to the States of Nicaragua, Salvador and\r\nCosta Rica, shall proceed to San Jose, Costa Rica, and there temporarily\r\nestablish the headquarters of the United States to those three States. I\r\ntook this action for what I regarded as the paramount interests of this\r\ncountry. It was developed upon an investigation by the Secretary of State\r\nthat the Government of Nicaragua, while not unwilling to receive Mr. Merry\r\nin his diplomatic quality, was unable to do so because of the compact\r\nconcluded June 20, 1895, whereby that Republic and those of Salvador and\r\nHonduras, forming what is known as the Greater Republic of Central America,\r\nhad surrendered to the representative Diet thereof their right to receive\r\nand send diplomatic agents. The Diet was not willing to accept him because\r\nhe was not accredited to that body. I could not accredit him to that body\r\nbecause the appropriation law of Congress did not permit it. Mr. Baker, the\r\npresent minister at Managua, has been directed to present his letters of\r\nrecall.\r\n\r\nMr. W. Godfrey Hunter has likewise been accredited to the Governments of\r\nGuatemala and Honduras, the same as his predecessor. Guatemala is not a\r\nmember of the Greater Republic of Central America, but Honduras is. Should\r\nthis latter Government decline to receive him, he has been instructed to\r\nreport this fact to his Government and await its further instructions.\r\n\r\nA subject of large importance to our country, and increasing appreciation\r\non the part of the people, is the completion of the great highway of trade\r\nbetween the Atlantic and Pacific, known as the Nicaragua Canal. Its utility\r\nand value to American commerce is universally admitted. The Commission\r\nappointed under date of July 24 last \"to continue the surveys and\r\nexaminations authorized by the act approved March 2, 1895,\" in regard to\r\n\"the proper route, feasibility, and cost of construction of the Nicaragua\r\nCanal, with a view of making complete plans for the entire work of\r\nconstruction of such canal,\" is now employed in the undertaking. In the\r\nfuture I shall take occasion to transmit to Congress the report of this\r\nCommission, making at the same time such further suggestions as may then\r\nseem advisable.\r\n\r\nUnder the provisions of the act of Congress approved March 3, 1897, for the\r\npromotion of an international agreement respecting bimetallism, I appointed\r\non the 14th day of April, 1897, Hon. Edward O. Wolcott of Colorado, Hon.\r\nAdlai E. Stevenson of Illinois, and Hon. Charles J. Paine of Massachusetts,\r\nas special envoys to represent the United States. They have been diligent\r\nin their efforts to secure the concurrence and cooperation of European\r\ncountries in the international settlement of the question, but up to this\r\ntime have not been able to secure an agreement contemplated by their\r\nmission.\r\n\r\nThe gratifying action of our great sister Republic of France in joining\r\nthis country in the attempt to bring about an agreement among the principal\r\ncommercial nations of Europe, whereby a fixed and relative value between\r\ngold and silver shall be secured, furnishes assurance that we are not alone\r\namong the larger nations of the world in realizing the international\r\ncharacter of the problem and in the desire of reaching some wise and\r\npractical solution of it. The British Government has published a resume of\r\nthe steps taken jointly by the French ambassador in London and the special\r\nenvoys of the United States, with whom our ambassador at London actively\r\nco-operated in the presentation of this subject to Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment. This will be laid before Congress.\r\n\r\nOur special envoys have not made their final report, as further\r\nnegotiations between the representatives of this Government and the\r\nGovernments of other countries are pending and in contemplation. They\r\nbelieve that doubts which have been raised in certain quarters respecting\r\nthe position of maintaining the stability of the parity between the metals\r\nand kindred questions may yet be solved by further negotiations.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile it gives me satisfaction to state that the special envoys have\r\nalready demonstrated their ability and fitness to deal with the subject,\r\nand it is to be earnestly hoped that their labors may result in an\r\ninternational agreement which will bring about recognition of both gold and\r\nsilver as money upon such terms, and with such safeguards as will secure\r\nthe use of both metals upon a basis which shall work no injustice to any\r\nclass of our citizens.\r\n\r\nIn order to execute as early as possible the provisions of the third and\r\nfourth sections of the Revenue Act, approved July 24, 1897, I appointed the\r\nHon. John A. Kasson of Iowa, a special commissioner plenipotentiary to\r\nundertake the requisite negotiations with foreign countries desiring to\r\navail themselves of these provisions. The negotiations are now proceeding\r\nwith several Governments, both European and American. It is believed that\r\nby a careful exercise of the powers conferred by that Act some grievances\r\nof our own and of other countries in our mutual trade relations may be\r\neither removed, or largely alleviated, and that the volume of our\r\ncommercial exchanges may be enlarged, with advantage to both contracting\r\nparties.\r\n\r\nMost desirable from every standpoint of national interest and patriotism is\r\nthe effort to extend our foreign commerce. To this end our merchant marine\r\nshould be improved and enlarged. We should do our full share of the\r\ncarrying trade of the world. We do not do it now. We should be the laggard\r\nno longer. The inferiority of our merchant marine is justly humiliating to\r\nthe national pride. The Government by every proper constitutional means,\r\nshould aid in making our ships familiar visitors at every commercial port\r\nof the world, thus opening up new and valuable markets to the surplus\r\nproducts of the farm and the factory.\r\n\r\nThe efforts which had been made during the two previous years by my\r\npredecessor to secure better protection to the fur seals in the North\r\nPacific Ocean and Bering Sea, were renewed at an early date by this\r\nAdministration, and have been pursued with earnestness. Upon my invitation,\r\nthe Governments of Japan and Russia sent delegates to Washington, and an\r\ninternational conference was held during the months of October and November\r\nlast, wherein it was unanimously agreed that under the existing regulations\r\nthis species of useful animals was threatened with extinction, and that an\r\ninternational agreement of all the interested powers was necessary for\r\ntheir adequate protection.\r\n\r\nThe Government of Great Britain did not see proper to be represented at\r\nthis conference, but subsequently sent to Washington, as delegates, the\r\nexpert commissioners of Great Britain and Canada who had, during the past\r\ntwo years, visited the Pribilof Islands, and who met in conference similar\r\ncommissioners on the part of the United States. The result of this\r\nconference was an agreement on important facts connected with the condition\r\nof the seal herd, heretofore in dispute, which should place beyond\r\ncontroversy the duty of the Governments concerned to adopt measures without\r\ndelay for the preservation and restoration of the herd. Negotiations to\r\nthis end are now in progress, the result of which I hope to be able to\r\nreport to Congress at an early day.\r\n\r\nInternational arbitration cannot be omitted from the list of subjects\r\nclaiming our consideration. Events have only served to strengthen the\r\ngeneral views on this question expressed in my inaugural address. The best\r\nsentiment of the civilized world is moving toward the settlement of\r\ndifferences between nations without resorting to the horrors of war.\r\nTreaties embodying these humane principles on broad lines, without in any\r\nway imperiling our interests or our honor, shall have my constant\r\nencouragement.\r\n\r\nThe acceptance by this Government of the invitation of the Republic of\r\nFrance to participate in the Universal Exposition of 1900, at Paris, was\r\nimmediately followed by the appointment of a special commissioner to\r\nrepresent the United States in the proposed exposition, with special\r\nreference to the securing of space for an adequate exhibit on behalf of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThe special commissioner delayed his departure for Paris long enough to\r\nascertain the probable demand for space by American exhibitors. His\r\ninquiries developed an almost unprecedented interest in the proposed\r\nexposition, and the information thus acquired enabled him to justify an\r\napplication for a much larger allotment of space for the American section\r\nthan had been reserved by the exposition authorities. The result was\r\nparticularly gratifying, in view of the fact that the United States was one\r\nof the last countries to accept the invitation of France.\r\n\r\nThe reception accorded our special commissioner was most cordial, and he\r\nwas given every reasonable assurance that the United States would receive a\r\nconsideration commensurate with the proportions of our exhibit. The report\r\nof the special commissioner as to the magnitude and importance of the\r\ncoming exposition, and the great demand for space by American exhibitors,\r\nsupplies new arguments for a liberal and judicious appropriation by\r\nCongress, to the end that an exhibit fairly representative of the\r\nindustries and resources of our country may be made in an exposition which\r\nwill illustrate the world's progress during the nineteenth century. That\r\nexposition is intended to be the most important and comprehensive of the\r\nlong series of international exhibitions, of which our own at Chicago was a\r\nbrilliant example, and it is desirable that the United States should make a\r\nworthy exhibit of American genius and skill and their unrivaled\r\nachievements in every branch of industry.\r\n\r\nThe present immediately effective force of the Navy consists of four battle\r\nships of the first class, two of the second, and forty-eight other vessels,\r\nranging from armored cruisers to torpedo boats. There are under\r\nconstruction five battle ships of the first class, sixteen torpedo boats,\r\nand one submarine boat. No provision has yet been made for the armor of\r\nthree of the five battle ships, as it has been impossible to obtain it at\r\nthe price fixed by Congress. It is of great importance that Congress\r\nprovide this armor, as until then the ships are of no fighting value.\r\n\r\nThe present naval force, especially in view of its increase by the ships\r\nnow under construction, while not as large as that of a few other powers,\r\nis a formidable force; its vessels are the very best of each type; and with\r\nthe increase that should be made to it from time to time in the future, and\r\ncareful attention to keeping it in a high state of efficiency and repair,\r\nit is well adapted to the necessities of the country.\r\n\r\nThe great increase of the Navy which has taken place in recent years was\r\njustified by the requirements for national defense, and has received public\r\napprobation. The time has now arrived, however, when this increase, to\r\nwhich the country is committed, should, for a time, take the form of\r\nincreased facilities commensurate with the increase of our naval vessels.\r\nIt is an unfortunate fact that there is only one dock on the Pacific Coast\r\ncapable of docking our largest ships, and only one on the Atlantic Coast,\r\nand that the latter has for the last six or seven months been under repair\r\nand therefore incapable of use. Immediate steps should be taken to provide\r\nthree or four docks of this capacity on the Atlantic Coast, at least one on\r\nthe Pacific Coast, and a floating dock in the Gulf. This is the\r\nrecommendation of a very competent Board, appointed to investigate the\r\nsubject. There should also be ample provision made for powder and\r\nprojectiles, and other munitions of war, and for an increased number of\r\nofficers and enlisted men. Some additions are also necessary to our\r\nnavy-yards, for the repair and care of our large number of vessels. As\r\nthere are now on the stocks five battle ships of the largest class, which\r\ncannot be completed for a year or two, I concur with the recommendation of\r\nthe Secretary of the Navy for an appropriation authorizing the construction\r\nof one battle ship for the Pacific Coast, where, at present, there is only\r\none in commission and one under construction, while on the Atlantic Coast\r\nthere are three in commission and four under construction; and also that\r\nseveral torpedo boats be authorized in connection with our general system\r\nof coast defense.\r\n\r\nThe Territory of Alaska requires the prompt and early attention of\r\nCongress. The conditions now existing demand material changes in the laws\r\nrelating to the Territory. The great influx of population during the past\r\nsummer and fall and the prospect of a still larger immigration in the\r\nspring will not permit us to longer neglect the extension of civil\r\nauthority within the Territory or postpone the establishment of a more\r\nthorough government.\r\n\r\nA general system of public surveys has not yet been extended to Alaska and\r\nall entries thus far made in that district are upon special surveys. The\r\nact of Congress extending to Alaska the mining laws of the United States\r\ncontained the reservation that it should not be construed to put in force\r\nthe general land laws of the country. By act approved March 3, 1891,\r\nauthority was given for entry of lands for town-site purposes and also for\r\nthe purchase of not exceeding one hundred and sixty acres then or\r\nthereafter occupied for purposes of trade and manufacture. The purpose of\r\nCongress as thus far expressed has been that only such rights should apply\r\nto that Territory as should be specifically named.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen how much remains to be done for that vast and remote and\r\nyet promising portion of our country. Special authority was given to the\r\nPresident by the Act of Congress approved July 24, 1897, to divide that\r\nTerritory into two land districts and to designate the boundaries thereof\r\nand to appoint registers and receivers of said land offices, and the\r\nPresident was also authorized to appoint a surveyor-general for the entire\r\ndistrict. Pursuant to this authority, a surveyor-general and receiver have\r\nbeen appointed, with offices at Sitka. If in the ensuing year the\r\nconditions justify it, the additional land district authorized by law will\r\nbe established, with an office at some point in the Yukon Valley. No\r\nappropriation, however, was made for this purpose, and that is now\r\nnecessary to be done for the two land districts into which the Territory is\r\nto be divided.\r\n\r\nI concur with the Secretary of War in his suggestions as to the necessity\r\nfor a military force in the Territory of Alaska for the protection of\r\npersons and property. Already a small force, consisting of twenty-five men,\r\nwith two officers, under command of Lieutenant-Colonel Randall, of the\r\nEighth Infantry, has been sent to St. Michael to establish a military\r\npost.\r\n\r\nAs it is to the interest of the Government to encourage the development and\r\nsettlement of the country and its duty to follow up its citizens there with\r\nthe benefits of legal machinery, I earnestly urge upon Congress the\r\nestablishment of a system of government with such flexibility as will\r\nenable it to adjust itself to the future areas of greatest population.\r\n\r\nThe startling though possibly exaggerated reports from the Yukon River\r\ncountry, of the probable shortage of food for the large number of people\r\nwho are wintering there without the means of leaving the country are\r\nconfirmed in such measure as to justify bringing the matter to the\r\nattention of Congress. Access to that country in winter can be had only by\r\nthe passes from Dyea and vicinity, which is a most difficult and perhaps an\r\nimpossible task. However, should these reports of the suffering of our\r\nfellow-citizens be further verified, every effort at any cost should be\r\nmade to carry them relief.\r\n\r\nFor a number of years past it has been apparent that the conditions under\r\nwhich the Five Civilized Tribes were established in the Indian Territory\r\nunder treaty provisions with the United States, with the right of\r\nself-government and the exclusion of all white persons from within their\r\nborders, have undergone so complete a change as to render the continuance\r\nof the system thus inaugurated practically impossible. The total number of\r\nthe Five Civilized Tribes, as shown by the last census, is 45,494, and this\r\nnumber has not materially increased; while the white population is\r\nestimated at from 200,000 to 250,000 which, by permission of the Indian\r\nGovernment has settled in the Territory. The present area of the Indian\r\nTerritory contains 25,694,564 acres, much of which is very fertile land.\r\nThe United States citizens residing in the Territory, most of whom have\r\ngone there by invitation or with the consent of the tribal authorities,\r\nhave made permanent homes for themselves. Numerous towns have been built in\r\nwhich from 500 to 5,000 white people now reside. Valuable residences and\r\nbusiness houses have been erected in many of them. Large business\r\nenterprises are carried on in which vast sums of money are employed, and\r\nyet these people, who have invested their capital in the development of the\r\nproductive resources of the country, are without title to the land they\r\noccupy, and have no voice whatever in the government either of the Nations\r\nor Tribes. Thousands of their children who were born in the Territory are\r\nof school age, but the doors of the schools of the Nations are shut against\r\nthem, and what education they get is by private contribution. No provision\r\nfor the protection of the life or property of these white citizens is made\r\nby the Tribal Governments and Courts.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Interior reports that leading Indians have absorbed\r\ngreat tracts of land to the exclusion of the common people, and government\r\nby an Indian aristocracy has been practically established, to the detriment\r\nof the people. It has been found impossible for the United States to keep\r\nits citizens out of the Territory, and the executory conditions contained\r\nin the treaties with these Nations have for the most part become impossible\r\nof execution. Nor has it been possible for the Tribal Governments to secure\r\nto each individual Indian his full enjoyment in common with Other Indians\r\nof the common property of the Nations. Friends of the Indians have long\r\nbelieved that the best interests of the Indians of the Five Civilized\r\nTribes would be found in American citizenship, with all the rights and\r\nprivileges which belong to that condition.\r\n\r\nBy section 16, of the act of March 3, 1893, the President was authorized to\r\nappoint three commissioners to enter into negotiations with the Cherokee,\r\nChoctaw, Chickasaw, Muscogee (or Creek), and Seminole Nations, commonly\r\nknown as the Five Civilized Tribes in the Indian Territory. Briefly, the\r\npurposes of the negotiations were to be: The extinguishment of Tribal\r\ntitles to any lands within that Territory now held by any and all such\r\nNations or Tribes, either by cession of the same or some part thereof to\r\nthe United States, or by allotment and division of the same in severalty\r\namong the Indians of such Nations or Tribes respectively as may be entitled\r\nto the same, or by such other method as may be agreed upon between the\r\nseveral Nations and Tribes aforesaid, or each of them, with the United\r\nStates, with a view to such an adjustment upon the basis of justice and\r\nequity as may, with the consent of the said Nations of Indians so far as\r\nmay be necessary, be requisite and suitable to enable the ultimate creation\r\nof a State or States of the Union which shall embrace the lands within said\r\nIndian Territory.\r\n\r\nThe Commission met much opposition from the beginning. The Indians were\r\nvery slow to act, and those in control manifested a decided disinclination\r\nto meet with favor the propositions submitted to them. A little more than\r\nthree years after this organization the Commission effected an agreement\r\nwith the Choctaw Nation alone. The Chickasaws, however, refused to agree to\r\nits terms, and as they have a common interest with the Choctaws in the\r\nlands of said Nations, the agreement with the latter Nation could have no\r\neffect without the consent of the former. On April 23, 1897, the Commission\r\neffected an agreement with both tribes--the Choctaws and Chickasaws. This\r\nagreement, it is understood, has been ratified by the constituted\r\nauthorities of the respective Tribes or Nations parties thereto, and only\r\nrequires ratification by Congress to make it binding.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of September, 1897, an agreement was effected with the Creek\r\nNation, but it is understood that the National Council of said Nation has\r\nrefused to ratify the same. Negotiations are yet to be had with the\r\nCherokees, the most populous of the Five Civilized Tribes, and with the\r\nSeminoles, the smallest in point of numbers and territory.\r\n\r\nThe provision in the Indian Appropriation Act, approved June 10, 1896,\r\nmakes it the duty of the Commission to investigate and determine the rights\r\nof applicants for citizenship in the Five Civilized Tribes, and to make\r\ncomplete census rolls of the citizens of said Tribes. The Commission is at\r\npresent engaged in this work among the Creeks, and has made appointments\r\nfor taking the census of these people up to and including the 30th of the\r\npresent month.\r\n\r\nShould the agreement between the Choctaws and Chickasaws be ratified by\r\nCongress and should the other Tribes fail to make an agreement with the\r\nCommission, then it will be necessary that some legislation shall be had by\r\nCongress, which, while just and honorable to the Indians, shall be\r\nequitable to the white people who have settled upon these lands by\r\ninvitation of the Tribal Nations.\r\n\r\nHon. Henry L. Dawes, Chairman of the Commission, in a letter to the\r\nSecretary of the Interior, under date of October 11, 1897, says:\r\n\"Individual ownership is, in their (the Commission's) opinion, absolutely\r\nessential to any permanent improvement in present conditions, and the lack\r\nof it is the root of nearly all the evils which so grievously afflict these\r\npeople. Allotment by agreement is the only possible method, unless the\r\nUnited States Courts are clothed with the authority to apportion the lands\r\namong the citizen Indians for whose use it was originally granted.\"\r\n\r\nI concur with the Secretary of the Interior that there can be no cure for\r\nthe evils engendered by the perversion of these great trusts, excepting by\r\ntheir resumption by the Government which created them.\r\n\r\nThe recent prevalence of yellow fever in a number of cities and towns\r\nthroughout the South has resulted in much disturbance of commerce, and\r\ndemonstrated the necessity of such amendments to our quarantine laws as\r\nwill make the regulations of the national quarantine authorities paramount.\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury, in the portion of his report relating to the\r\noperation of the Marine Hospital Service, calls attention to the defects in\r\nthe present quarantine laws, and recommends amendments thereto which will\r\ngive the Treasury Department the requisite authority to prevent the\r\ninvasion of epidemic diseases from foreign countries, and in times of\r\nemergency, like that of the past summer, will add to the efficiency of the\r\nsanitary measures for the protection of the people, and at the same time\r\nprevent unnecessary restriction of commerce. I concur in his\r\nrecommendation.\r\n\r\nIn further effort to prevent the invasion of the United States by yellow\r\nfever, the importance of the discovery of the exact cause of the disease,\r\nwhich up to the present time has been undetermined, is obvious, and to this\r\nend a systematic bacteriological investigation should be made. I therefore\r\nrecommend that Congress authorize the appointment of a commission by the\r\nPresident, to consist of four expert bacteriologists, one to be selected\r\nfrom the medical officers of the Marine Hospital Service, one to be\r\nappointed from civil life, one to be detailed from the medical officers of\r\nthe Army, and one from the medical officers of the Navy.\r\n\r\nThe Union Pacific Railway, Main Line, was sold under the decree of the\r\nUnited States Court for the District of Nebraska, on the 1st and 2d of\r\nNovember of this year. The amount due the Government consisted of the\r\nprincipal of the subsidy bonds, $27,236,512, and the accrued interest\r\nthereon, $31,211,711.75, making the total indebtedness, $58,448,223.75. The\r\nbid at the sale covered the first mortgage lien and the entire mortgage\r\nclaim of the Government, principal and interest.\r\n\r\nThe sale of the subsidized portion of the Kansas Pacific Line, upon which\r\nthe Government holds a second mortgage lien, has been postponed at the\r\ninstance of the Government to December 16, 1897. The debt of this division\r\nof the Union Pacific Railway to the Government on November 1, 1897, was the\r\nprincipal of the subsidy bonds, $6,303,000, and the unpaid and accrued\r\ninterest thereon, $6,626,690.33, making a total of $12,929,690.33.\r\n\r\nThe sale of this road was originally advertised for November 4, but for the\r\npurpose of securing the utmost public notice of the event it was postponed\r\nuntil December 16, and a second advertisement of the sale was made. By the\r\ndecree of the Court, the upset price on the sale of the Kansas Pacific will\r\nyield to the Government the sum of $2,500,000 over all prior liens, costs,\r\nand charges. If no other or better bid is made, this sum is all that the\r\nGovernment will receive on its claim of nearly $13,000,000. The Government\r\nhas no information as to whether there will be other bidders or a better\r\nbid than the minimum amount herein stated. The question presented therefore\r\nis: Whether the Government shall, under the authority given it by the act\r\nof March 3, 1887, purchase or redeem the road in the event that a bid is\r\nnot made by private parties covering the entire Government claim. To\r\nqualify the Government to bid at the sales will require a deposit of\r\n$900,000, as follows: In the Government cause $500,000 and in each of the\r\nfirst mortgage causes $200,000, and in the latter the deposit must be in\r\ncash. Payments at the sale are as follows: Upon the acceptance of the bid a\r\nsum which with the amount already deposited shall equal fifteen per cent of\r\nthe bid; the balance in installments of twenty-five per cent thirty, forty,\r\nand fifty days after the confirmation of the sale. The lien on the Kansas\r\nPacific prior to that of the Government on the 30th July, 1897, principal\r\nand interest, amounted to $7,281,048.11. The Government, therefore, should\r\nit become the highest bidder, will have to pay the amount of the first\r\nmortgage lien.\r\n\r\nI believe that under the act of 1887 it has the authority to do this and in\r\nabsence of any action by Congress I shall direct the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury to make the necessary deposit as required by the Court's decree to\r\nqualify as a bidder and to bid at the sale a sum which will at least equal\r\nthe principal of the debt due to the Government; but suggest in order to\r\nremove all controversy that an amendment of the law be immediately passed\r\nexplicitly giving such powers and appropriating in general terms whatever\r\nsum is sufficient therefor.\r\n\r\nIn so important a matter as the Government becoming the possible owner of\r\nrailroad property which it perforce must conduct and operate, I feel\r\nconstrained to lay before Congress these facts for its consideration and\r\naction before the consummation of the sale. It is clear to my mind that the\r\nGovernment should not permit the property to be sold at a price which will\r\nyield less than one-half of the principal of its debt and less than\r\none-fifth of its entire debt, principal and interest. But whether the\r\nGovernment, rather than accept less than its claim, should become a bidder\r\nand thereby the owner of the property, I submit to the Congress for\r\naction.\r\n\r\nThe Library building provided for by the act of Congress approved April 15,\r\n1886, has been completed and opened to the public. It should be a matter of\r\ncongratulation that through the foresight and munificence of Congress the\r\nnation possesses this noble treasure-house of knowledge. It is earnestly to\r\nbe hoped that having done so much toward the cause of education, Congress\r\nwill continue to develop the Library in every phase of research to the end\r\nthat it may be not only one of the most magnificent but among the richest\r\nand most useful libraries in the world.\r\n\r\nThe important branch of our Government known as the Civil Service, the\r\npractical improvement of which has long been a subject of earnest\r\ndiscussion, has of late years received increased legislative and Executive\r\napproval. During the past few months the service has been placed upon a\r\nstill firmer basis of business methods and personal merit. While the right\r\nof our veteran soldiers to reinstatement in deserving cases has been\r\nasserted, dismissals for merely political reasons have been carefully\r\nguarded against, the examinations for admittance to the service enlarged\r\nand at the same time rendered less technical and more practical; and a\r\ndistinct advance has been made by giving a hearing before dismissal upon\r\nall cases where incompetency is charged or demand made for the removal of\r\nofficials in any of the Departments. This order has been made to give to\r\nthe accused his right to be heard but without in anyway impairing the power\r\nof removal, which should always be exercised in cases of inefficiency and\r\nincompetency, and which is one of the vital safeguards of the civil service\r\nreform system, preventing stagnation and deadwood and keeping every\r\nemployee keenly alive to the fact that the security of his tenure depends\r\nnot on favor but on his own tested and carefully watched record of\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nMuch of course still remains to be accomplished before the system can be\r\nmade reasonably perfect for our needs. There are places now in the\r\nclassified service which ought to be exempted and others not classified may\r\nproperly be included. I shall not hesitate to exempt cases which I think\r\nhave been improperly included in the classified service or include those\r\nwhich in my judgment will best promote the public service. The system has\r\nthe approval of the people and it will be my endeavor to uphold and extend\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI am forced by the length of this Message to omit many important references\r\nto affairs of the Government with which Congress will have to deal at the\r\npresent session. They are fully discussed in the departmental reports, to\r\nall of which I invite your earnest attention.\r\n\r\nThe estimates of the expenses of the Government by the several Departments\r\nwill, I am sure, have your careful scrutiny. While the Congress may not\r\nfind it an easy task to reduce the expenses of the Government, it should\r\nnot encourage their increase. These expenses will in my judgment admit of a\r\ndecrease in many branches of the Government without injury to the public\r\nservice. It is a commanding duty to keep the appropriations within the\r\nreceipts of the Government, and thus avoid a deficit.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nWilliam McKinley\r\nDecember 5, 1898\r\n\r\nTo the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the added burdens rendered necessary by the war, our people\r\nrejoice in a very satisfactory and steadily increasing degree of\r\nprosperity, evidenced by the largest volume of business ever recorded.\r\nManufacture has been productive, agricultural pursuits have yielded\r\nabundant returns, labor in all fields of industry is better rewarded,\r\nrevenue legislation passed by the present Congress has increased the\r\nTreasury's receipts to the amount estimated by its authors, the finances of\r\nthe Government have been successfully administered and its credit advanced\r\nto the first rank, while its currency has been maintained at the world's\r\nhighest standard. Military service under a common flag and for a righteous\r\ncause has strengthened the national spirit and served to cement more\r\nclosely than ever the fraternal bonds between every section of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nA review of the relation of the United States to other powers, always\r\nappropriate, is this year of primary importance in view of the momentous\r\nissues which have arisen, demanding in one instance the ultimate\r\ndetermination by arms and involving far-reaching consequences which will\r\nrequire the earnest attention of the Congress.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message very full consideration was given to the question\r\nof the duty of the Government of the United States toward Spain and the\r\nCuban insurrection as being by far the most important problem with which we\r\nwere then called upon to deal. The considerations then advanced and the\r\nexposition of the views therein expressed disclosed my sense of the extreme\r\ngravity of the situation. Setting aside as logically unfounded or\r\npractically inadmissible the recognition of the Cuban insurgents as\r\nbelligerents, the recognition of the independence of Cuba, neutral\r\nintervention to end the war by imposing a rational compromise between the\r\ncontestants, intervention in favor of one or the other party, and forcible\r\nannexation of the island, I concluded it was honestly due to our friendly\r\nrelations with Spain that she should be given a reasonable chance to\r\nrealize her expectations of reform to which she had become irrevocably\r\ncommitted. Within a few weeks previously she had announced comprehensive\r\nplans which it was confidently asserted would be efficacious to remedy the\r\nevils so deeply affecting our own country, so injurious to the true\r\ninterests of the mother country as well as to those of Cuba, and so\r\nrepugnant to the universal sentiment of humanity.\r\n\r\nThe ensuing month brought little sign of real progress toward the\r\npacification of Cuba. The autonomous administrations set up in the capital\r\nand some of the principal cities appeared not to gain the favor of the\r\ninhabitants nor to be able to extend their influence to the large extent of\r\nterritory held by the insurgents, while the military arm, obviously unable\r\nto cope with the still active rebellion, continued many of the most\r\nobjectionable and offensive policies of the government that had preceded\r\nit. No tangible relief was afforded the vast numbers of unhappy\r\nreconcentrados, despite the reiterated professions made in that regard and\r\nthe amount appropriated by Spain to that end. The proffered expedient of\r\nzones of cultivation proved illusory. Indeed no less practical nor more\r\ndelusive promises of succor could well have been tendered to the exhausted\r\nand destitute people, stripped of all that made life and home dear and\r\nherded in a strange region among unsympathetic strangers hardly less\r\nnecessitous than themselves.\r\n\r\nBy the end of December the mortality among them had frightfully increased.\r\nConservative estimates from Spanish sources placed the deaths among these\r\ndistressed people at over 40 per cent from the time General Weyler's decree\r\nof reconcentration was enforced. With the acquiescence of the Spanish\r\nauthorities, a scheme was adopted for relief by charitable contributions\r\nraised in this country and distributed, under the direction of the\r\nconsul-general and the several consuls, by noble and earnest individual\r\neffort through the organized agencies of the American Red Cross. Thousands\r\nof lives were thus saved, but many thousands more were inaccessible to such\r\nforms of aid.\r\n\r\nThe war continued on the old footing, without comprehensive plan,\r\ndeveloping only the same spasmodic encounters, barren of strategic result,\r\nthat had marked the course of the earlier ten years' rebellion as well as\r\nthe present insurrection from its start. No alternative save physical\r\nexhaustion of either combatant, and therewithal the practical ruin of the\r\nisland, lay in sight, but how far distant no one could venture to\r\nconjecture.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture, on the 15th of February last, occurred the destruction of\r\nthe battle ship Maine while rightfully lying in the harbor of Havana on a\r\nmission of international courtesy and good will--a catastrophe the\r\nsuspicious nature and horror of which stirred the nation's heart\r\nprofoundly. It is a striking evidence of the poise and sturdy good sense\r\ndistinguishing our national character that this shocking blow, falling upon\r\na generous people already deeply touched by preceding events in Cuba, did\r\nnot move them to an instant desperate resolve to tolerate no longer the\r\nexistence of a condition of danger and disorder at our doors that made\r\npossible such a deed, by whomsoever wrought. Yet the instinct of justice\r\nprevailed, and the nation anxiously awaited the result of the searching\r\ninvestigation at once set on foot. The finding of the naval board of\r\ninquiry established that the origin of the explosion was external, by a\r\nsubmarine mine, and only halted through lack of positive testimony to fix\r\nthe responsibility of its authorship.\r\n\r\nAll these things carried conviction to the most thoughtful, even before the\r\nfinding of the naval court, that a crisis in our relations with Spain and\r\ntoward Cuba was at hand. So strong was this belief that it needed but a\r\nbrief Executive suggestion to the Congress to receive immediate answer to\r\nthe duty of making instant provision for the possible and perhaps speedily\r\nprobable emergency of war, and the remarkable, almost unique, spectacle was\r\npresented of a unanimous vote of both Houses, on the 9th of March,\r\nappropriating $50,000,000 \"for the national defense and for each and every\r\npurpose connected therewith, to be expended at the discretion of the\r\nPresident.\" That this act of prevision came none too soon was disclosed\r\nwhen the application of the fund was undertaken. Our coasts were\r\npractically undefended. Our Navy needed large provision for increased\r\nammunition and supplies, and even numbers to cope with any sudden attack\r\nfrom the navy of Spain, which comprised modern vessels of the highest type\r\nof continental perfection. Our Army also required enlargement of men and\r\nmunitions. The details of the hurried preparation for the dreaded\r\ncontingency are told in the reports of the Secretaries of War and of the\r\nNavy, and need not be repeated here. It is sufficient to say that the\r\noutbreak of war when it did come found our nation not unprepared to meet\r\nthe conflict.\r\n\r\nNor was the apprehension of coming strife confined to our own country. It\r\nwas felt by the continental powers, which on April 6, through their\r\nambassadors and envoys, addressed to the Executive an expression of hope\r\nthat humanity and moderation might mark the course of this Government and\r\npeople, and that further negotiations would lead to an agreement which,\r\nwhile securing the maintenance of peace, would afford all necessary\r\nguaranties for the reestablishment of order in Cuba. In responding to that\r\nrepresentation I said I shared the hope the envoys had expressed that peace\r\nmight be preserved in a manner to terminate the chronic condition of\r\ndisturbance in Cuba, so injurious and menacing to our interests and\r\ntranquillity, as well as shocking to our sentiments of humanity; and while\r\nappreciating the humanitarian and disinterested character of the\r\ncommunication they had made on behalf of the powers, I stated the\r\nconfidence of this Government, for its part, that equal appreciation would\r\nbe shown for its own earnest and unselfish endeavors to fulfill a duty to\r\nhumanity by ending a situation the indefinite prolongation of which had\r\nbecome insufferable.\r\n\r\nStill animated by the hope of a peaceful solution and obeying the dictates\r\nof duty, no effort was relaxed to bring about a speedy ending of the Cuban\r\nstruggle. Negotiations to this object continued actively with the\r\nGovernment of Spain, looking to the immediate conclusion of a six months'\r\narmistice in Cuba, with a view to effect the recognition of her people's\r\nright to independence. Besides this, the instant revocation of the order of\r\nreconcentration was asked, so that the sufferers, returning to their homes\r\nand aided by united American and Spanish effort, might be put in a way to\r\nsupport themselves and, by orderly resumption of the well-nigh destroyed\r\nproductive energies of the island, contribute to the restoration of its\r\ntranquillity and well-being. Negotiations continued for some little time at\r\nMadrid, resulting in offers by the Spanish Government which could not but\r\nbe regarded as inadequate. It was proposed to confide the preparation of\r\npeace to the insular parliament, yet to be convened under the autonomous\r\ndecrees of November, 1897, but without impairment in any wise of the\r\nconstitutional powers of the Madrid Government, which to that end would\r\ngrant an armistice, if solicited by the insurgents, for such time as the\r\ngeneral in chief might see fit to fix. How and with what scope of\r\ndiscretionary powers the insular parliament was expected to set about the\r\n\"preparation\" of peace did not appear. If it were to be by negotiation with\r\nthe insurgents, the issue seemed to rest on the one side with a body chosen\r\nby a fraction of the electors in the districts under Spanish control, and\r\non the other with the insurgent population holding the interior country,\r\nunrepresented in the so-called parliament and defiant at the suggestion of\r\nsuing for peace.\r\n\r\nGrieved and disappointed at this barren outcome of my sincere endeavors to\r\nreach a practicable solution, I felt it my duty to remit the whole question\r\nto the Congress. In the message of April 11, 1898, I announced that with\r\nthis last overture in the direction of immediate peace in Cuba and its\r\ndisappointing reception by Spain the effort of the Executive was brought to\r\nan end. I again reviewed the alternative courses of action which had been\r\nproposed, concluding that the only one consonant with international policy\r\nand compatible with our firm-set historical traditions was intervention as\r\na neutral to stop the war and check the hopeless sacrifice of life, even\r\nthough that resort involved \"hostile constraint upon both the parties to\r\nthe contest, as well to enforce a truce as to guide the eventual\r\nsettlement.\" The grounds justifying that step were the interests of\r\nhumanity, the duty to protect the life and property of our citizens in\r\nCuba, the right to check injury to our commerce and people through the\r\ndevastation of the island, and, most important, the need of removing at\r\nonce and forever the constant menace and the burdens entailed upon our\r\nGovernment by the uncertainties and perils of the situation caused by the\r\nunendurable disturbance in Cuba. I said: The long trial has proved that the\r\nobject for which Spain has waged the war can not be attained. The fire of\r\ninsurrection may flame or may smolder with varying seasons, but it has not\r\nbeen and it is plain that it can not be extinguished by present methods.\r\nThe only hope of relief and repose from a condition which can no longer be\r\nendured is the enforced pacification of Cuba. In the name of humanity, in\r\nthe name of civilization, in behalf of endangered American interests which\r\ngive us the right and the duty to speak and to act, the war in Cuba must\r\nstop. In view of all this the Congress was asked to authorize and empower\r\nthe President to take measures to secure a full and final termination of\r\nhostilities between Spain and the people of Cuba and to secure in the\r\nisland the establishment of a stable government, capable of maintaining\r\norder and observing its international obligations, insuring peace and\r\ntranquillity and the security of its citizens as well as our own, and for\r\nthe accomplishment of those ends to use the military and naval forces of\r\nthe United States as might be necessary, with added authority to continue\r\ngenerous relief to the starving people of Cuba.\r\n\r\nThe response of the Congress, after nine days of earnest deliberation,\r\nduring which the almost unanimous sentiment of your body was developed on\r\nevery point save as to the expediency of coupling the proposed action with\r\na formal recognition of the Republic of Cuba as the true and lawful\r\ngovernment of that island--a proposition which failed of adoption--the\r\nCongress, after conference, on the 19th of April, by a vote of 42 to 35 in\r\nthe Senate and 311 to 6 in the House of Representatives, passed the\r\nmemorable joint resolution declaring--\r\n\r\nFirst. That the people of the island of Cuba are, and of right ought to be,\r\nfree and independent.\r\n\r\nSecond. That it is the duty of the United States to demand, and the\r\nGovernment of the United States does hereby demand, that the Government of\r\nSpain at once relinquish its authority and government in the island of Cuba\r\nand withdraw its land and naval forces from Cuba and Cuban waters.\r\n\r\nThird. That the President of the United States be, and he hereby is,\r\ndirected and empowered to use the entire land and naval forces of the\r\nUnited States and to call into the actual service of the United States the\r\nmilitia of the several States to such extent as may be necessary to carry\r\nthese resolutions into effect.\r\n\r\nFourth. That the United States hereby disclaims any disposition or\r\nintention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction, or control over said\r\nisland except for the pacification thereof, and asserts its determination\r\nwhen that is accomplished to leave the government and control of the island\r\nto its people. This resolution was approved by the Executive on the next\r\nday, April 20. A copy was at once communicated to the Spanish minister at\r\nthis capital, who forthwith announced that his continuance in Washington\r\nhad thereby become impossible, and asked for his passports, which were\r\ngiven him. He thereupon withdrew from Washington, leaving the protection of\r\nSpanish interests in the United States to the French ambassador and the\r\nAustro-Hungarian minister. Simultaneously with its communication to the\r\nSpanish minister here, General Woodford, the American minister at Madrid,\r\nwas telegraphed confirmation of the text of the joint resolution and\r\ndirected to communicate it to the Government of Spain with the formal\r\ndemand that it at once relinquish its authority and government in the\r\nisland of Cuba and withdraw its forces therefrom, coupling this demand with\r\nannouncement of the intentions of this Government as to the future of the\r\nisland, in conformity with the fourth clause of the resolution, and giving\r\nSpain until noon of April 23 to reply.\r\n\r\nThat demand, although, as above shown, officially made known to the Spanish\r\nenvoy here, was not delivered at Madrid. After the instruction reached\r\nGeneral Woodford on the morning of April 21, but before he could present\r\nit, the Spanish minister of state notified him that upon the President's\r\napproval of the joint resolution the Madrid Government, regarding the act\r\nas \"equivalent to an evident declaration of war,\" had ordered its minister\r\nin Washington to withdraw, thereby breaking off diplomatic relations\r\nbetween the two countries and ceasing all official communication between\r\ntheir respective representatives. General Woodford thereupon demanded his\r\npassports and quitted Madrid the same day.\r\n\r\nSpain having thus denied the demand of the United States and initiated that\r\ncomplete form of rupture of relations which attends a state of war, the\r\nexecutive powers authorized by the resolution were at once used by me to\r\nmeet the enlarged contingency of actual war between sovereign states. On\r\nApril 22 I proclaimed a blockade of the north coast of Cuba, including\r\nports on said coast between Cardenas and Bahia Honda, and the port of\r\nCienfuegos, on the south coast of Cuba, and on the 23d I called for\r\nvolunteers to execute the purpose of the resolution. By my message of April\r\n25 the Congress was informed of the situation, and I recommended formal\r\ndeclaration of the existence of a state of war between the United States\r\nand Spain. The Congress accordingly voted on the same day the act approved\r\nApril 25, 1898, declaring the existence of such war from and including the\r\n21st day of April, and reenacted the provision of the resolution of April\r\n20 directing the President to use all the armed forces of the nation to\r\ncarry that act into effect. Due notification of the existence of war as\r\naforesaid was given April 25 by telegraph to all the governments with which\r\nthe United States maintain relations, in order that their neutrality might\r\nbe assured during the war. The various governments responded with\r\nproclamations of neutrality, each after its own methods. It is not among\r\nthe least gratifying incidents of the struggle that the obligations of\r\nneutrality were impartially discharged by all, often under delicate and\r\ndifficult circumstances.\r\n\r\nIn further fulfillment of international duty I issued, April 26, 1893, a\r\nproclamation announcing the treatment proposed to be accorded to vessels\r\nand their cargoes as to blockade, contraband, the exercise of the right of\r\nsearch, and the immunity of neutral flags and neutral goods under enemy's\r\nflag. A similar proclamation was made by the Spanish Government. In the\r\nconduct of hostilities the rules of the Declaration of Paris, including\r\nabstention from resort to privateering, have accordingly been observed by\r\nboth belligerents, although neither was a party to that declaration.\r\n\r\nOur country thus, after an interval of half a century of peace with all\r\nnations, found itself engaged in deadly conflict with a foreign enemy.\r\nEvery nerve was strained to meet the emergency. The response to the initial\r\ncall for 125,000 volunteers was instant and complete, as was also the\r\nresult of the second call, of May 25, for 75,000 additional volunteers. The\r\nranks of the Regular Army were increased to the limits provided by the act\r\nof April 26, 1898.\r\n\r\nThe enlisted force of the Navy on the 15th day of August, when it reached\r\nits maximum, numbered 24,123 men and apprentices. One hundred and three\r\nvessels were added to the Navy by purchase, 1 was presented to the\r\nGovernment, 1 leased, and the 4 vessels of the International Navigation\r\nCompany--the St. Paul, St. Louis, New York, and Paris--were chartered. In\r\naddition to these the revenue cutters and lighthouse tenders were turned\r\nover to the Navy Department and became temporarily a part of the auxiliary\r\nNavy.\r\n\r\nThe maximum effective fighting force of the Navy during the war, separated\r\ninto classes, was as follows:\r\n\r\nFour battle ships of the first class, 1 battle ship of the second class, 2\r\narmored cruisers, 6 coast-defense monitors, 1 armored ram, 12 protected\r\ncruisers, 3 unprotected cruisers, 18 gunboats, 1 dynamite cruiser, 11\r\ntorpedo boats; vessels of the old Navy, including monitors, 14. Auxiliary\r\nNavy: 11 auxiliary cruisers, 28 converted yachts, 27 converted tugs, 19\r\nconverted colliers, 15 revenue cutters, 4 light-house tenders, and 19\r\nmiscellaneous vessels.\r\n\r\nMuch alarm was felt along our entire Atlantic seaboard lest some attack\r\nmight be made by the enemy. Every precaution was taken to prevent possible\r\ninjury to our great cities lying along the coast. Temporary garrisons were\r\nprovided, drawn from the State militia; infantry and light batteries were\r\ndrawn from the volunteer force. About 12,000 troops were thus employed. The\r\ncoast signal service was established for observing the approach of an\r\nenemy's ships to the coast of the United States, and the Life-Saving and\r\nLight-House services cooperated, which enabled the Navy Department to have\r\nall portions of the Atlantic coast, from Maine to Texas, under\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\nThe auxiliary Navy was created under the authority of Congress and was\r\nofficered and manned by the Naval Militia of the several States. This\r\norganization patrolled the coast and performed the duty of a second line of\r\ndefense. Under the direction of the Chief of Engineers submarine mines were\r\nplaced at the most exposed points. Before the outbreak of the war permanent\r\nmining casemates and cable galleries had been constructed at nearly all\r\nimportant harbors. Most of the torpedo material was not to be found in the\r\nmarket, and had to be specially manufactured. Under date of April 19\r\ndistrict officers were directed to take all preliminary measures short of\r\nthe actual attaching of the loaded mines to the cables, and on April 22\r\ntelegraphic orders were issued to place the loaded mines in position.\r\n\r\nThe aggregate number of mines placed was 1,535, at the principal harbors\r\nfrom Maine to California. Preparations were also made for the planting of\r\nmines at certain other harbors, but owing to the early destruction of the\r\nSpanish fleet these mines were not placed.\r\n\r\nThe Signal Corps was promptly organized, and performed service of the most\r\ndifficult and important character. Its operations during the war covered\r\nthe electrical connection of all coast fortifications, the establishment of\r\ntelephonic and telegraphic facilities for the camps at Manila, Santiago,\r\nand in Puerto Rico. There were constructed 300 miles of line at ten great\r\ncamps, thus facilitating military movements from those points in a manner\r\nheretofore unknown in military administration. Field telegraph lines were\r\nestablished and maintained under the enemy's fire at Manila, and later the\r\nManila-Hongkong cable was reopened.\r\n\r\nIn Puerto Rico cable communications were opened over a discontinued route,\r\nand on land the headquarters of the commanding officer was kept in\r\ntelegraphic or telephonic communication with the division commanders on\r\nfour different lines of operations.\r\n\r\nThere was placed in Cuban waters a completely outfitted cable ship, with\r\nwar cables and cable gear, suitable both for the destruction of\r\ncommunications belonging to the enemy and the establishment of our own. Two\r\nocean cables were destroyed under the enemy's batteries at Santiago. The\r\nday previous to the landing of General Shafter's corps, at Caimanera,\r\nwithin 20 miles of the landing place, cable communications were established\r\nand a cable station opened giving direct communication with the Government\r\nat Washington. This service was invaluable to the Executive in directing\r\nthe operations of the Army and Navy. With a total force of over 1,300, the\r\nloss was by disease in camp and field, officers and men included, only 5.\r\n\r\nThe national-defense fund of $50,000,000 was expended in large part by the\r\nArmy and Navy, and the objects for which it was used are fully shown in the\r\nreports of the several Secretaries. It was a most timely appropriation,\r\nenabling the Government to strengthen its defenses and make preparations\r\ngreatly needed in case of war.\r\n\r\nThis fund being inadequate to the requirements of equipment and for the\r\nconduct of the war, the patriotism of the Congress provided the means in\r\nthe war-revenue act of June 13 by authorizing a 3 per cent popular loan not\r\nto exceed $400,000,000 and by levying additional imposts and taxes. Of the\r\nauthorized loan $200,000,000 were offered and promptly taken the\r\nsubscriptions so far exceeding the call as to cover it many times over,\r\nwhile, preference being given to the smaller bids, no single allotment\r\nexceeded $5,000. This was a most encouraging and significant result,\r\nshowing the vast resources of the nation and the determination of the\r\npeople to uphold their country's honor.\r\n\r\nIt is not within the province of this message to narrate the history of the\r\nextraordinary war that followed the Spanish declaration of April 21, but a\r\nbrief recital of its more salient features is appropriate.\r\n\r\nThe first encounter of the war in point of date took place April 27, when a\r\ndetachment of the blockading squadron made a reconnoissance in force at\r\nMatanzas, shelled the harbor forts, and demolished several new works in\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\nThe next engagement was destined to mark a memorable epoch in maritime\r\nwarfare. The Pacific fleet, under Commodore George Dewey, had lain for some\r\nweeks at Hongkong. Upon the colonial proclamation of neutrality being\r\nissued and the customary twenty-four hours' notice being given, it repaired\r\nto Mirs Bay, near Hongkong, whence it proceeded to the Philippine Islands\r\nunder telegraphed orders to capture or destroy the formidable Spanish fleet\r\nthen assembled at Manila. At daybreak on the 1st of May the American force\r\nentered Manila Bay, and after a few hours' engagement effected the total\r\ndestruction of the Spanish fleet, consisting of ten war ships and a\r\ntransport, besides capturing the naval station and forts at Cavite, thus\r\nannihilating the Spanish naval power in the Pacific Ocean and completely\r\ncontrolling the bay of Manila, with the ability to take the city at will.\r\nNot a life was lost on our ships, the wounded only numbering seven, while\r\nnot a vessel was materially injured. For this gallant achievement the\r\nCongress, upon my recommendation, fitly bestowed upon the actors preferment\r\nand substantial reward.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this remarkable victory upon the spirit of our people and\r\nupon the fortunes of the war was instant. A prestige of invincibility\r\nthereby attached to our arms which continued throughout the struggle.\r\nReenforcements were hurried to Manila under the command of Major-General\r\nMerritt and firmly established within sight of the capital, which lay\r\nhelpless before our guns.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th day of May the Government was advised officially of the victory\r\nat Manila, and at once inquired of the commander of our fleet what troops\r\nwould be required. The information was received on the 15th day of May, and\r\nthe first army expedition sailed May 25 and arrived off Manila June 30.\r\nOther expeditions soon followed, the total force consisting of 641 officers\r\nand 15,058 enlisted men.\r\n\r\nOnly reluctance to cause needless loss of life and property prevented the\r\nearly storming and capture of the city, and therewith the absolute military\r\noccupancy of the whole group. The insurgents meanwhile had resumed the\r\nactive hostilities suspended by the uncompleted truce of December, 1897.\r\nTheir forces invested Manila from the northern and eastern sides, but were\r\nconstrained by Admiral Dewey and General Merrill from attempting an\r\nassault. It was fitting that whatever was to be done in the way of decisive\r\noperations in that quarter should be accomplished by the strong arm of the\r\nUnited States alone. Obeying the stern precept of war which enjoins the\r\novercoming of the adversary and the extinction of his power wherever\r\nassailable as the speedy and sure means to win a peace, divided victory was\r\nnot permissible, for no partition of the rights and responsibilities\r\nattending the enforcement of a just and advantageous peace could be thought\r\nof.\r\n\r\nFollowing the comprehensive scheme of general attack, powerful forces were\r\nassembled at various points on our coast to invade Cuba and Puerto Rico.\r\nMeanwhile naval demonstrations were made at several exposed points. On May\r\n11 the cruiser Wilmington and torpedo boat Winslow were unsuccessful in an\r\nattempt to silence the batteries at Cardenas, a gallant ensign, Worth\r\nBagley, and four seamen falling. These grievous fatalities were, strangely\r\nenough, among the very few which occurred during our naval operations in\r\nthis extraordinary conflict.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Spanish naval preparations had been pushed with great vigor.\r\nA powerful squadron under Admiral Cervera, which had assembled at the Cape\r\nVerde Islands before the outbreak of hostilities, had crossed the ocean,\r\nand by its erratic movements in the Caribbean Sea delayed our military\r\nplans while baffling the pursuit of our fleets. For a time fears were felt\r\nlest the Oregon and Marietta, then nearing home after their long voyage\r\nfrom San Francisco of over 15,000 miles, might be surprised by Admiral\r\nCervera's fleet, but their fortunate arrival dispelled these apprehensions\r\nand lent much-needed reenforcement. Not until Admiral Cervera took refuge\r\nin the harbor of Santiago de Cuba, about May 19, was it practicable to plan\r\na systematic naval and military attack upon the Antillean possessions of\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\nSeveral demonstrations occurred on the coasts of Cuba and Puerto Rico in\r\npreparation for the larger event. On May 13 the North Atlantic Squadron\r\nshelled San Juan de Puerto Rico. On May 30 Commodore Schley's squadron\r\nbombarded the forts guarding the mouth of Santiago Harbor. Neither attack\r\nhad any material result. It was evident that well-ordered land operations\r\nwere indispensable to achieve a decisive advantage.\r\n\r\nThe next act in the war thrilled not alone the hearts of our countrymen but\r\nthe world by its exceptional heroism. On the night of June 3 Lieutenant\r\nHobson, aided by seven devoted volunteers, blocked the narrow outlet from\r\nSantiago Harbor by sinking the collier Merrimac in the channel, under a\r\nfierce fire from the shore batteries, escaping with their lives as by a\r\nmiracle, but falling into the hands of the Spaniards. It is a most\r\ngratifying incident of the war that the bravery of this little band of\r\nheroes was cordially appreciated by the Spanish admiral, who sent a flag of\r\ntruce to notify Admiral Sampson of their safety and to compliment them on\r\ntheir daring act. They were subsequently exchanged July 7.\r\n\r\nBy June 7 the cutting of the last Cuban cable isolated the island.\r\nThereafter the invasion was vigorously prosecuted. On June 10, under a\r\nheavy protecting fire, a landing of 600 marines from the Oregon,\r\nMarblehead, and Yankee was effected in Guantanamo Bay, where it had been\r\ndetermined to establish a naval station.\r\n\r\nThis important and essential port was taken from the enemy, after severe\r\nfighting, by the marines, who were the first organized force of the United\r\nStates to land in Cuba.\r\n\r\nThe position so won was held despite desperate attempts to dislodge our\r\nforces. By June 16 additional forces were landed and strongly in-trenched.\r\nOn June 22 the advance of the invading army under Major-General Shafter\r\nlanded at Daiquiri, about 15 miles east of Santiago. This was accomplished\r\nunder great difficulties, but with marvelous dispatch. On June 23 the\r\nmovement against Santiago was begun. On the 24th the first serious\r\nengagement took place, in which the First and Tenth Cavalry and the First\r\nUnited States Volunteer Cavalry, General Young's brigade of General\r\nWheeler's division, participated, losing heavily. By nightfall, however,\r\nground within 5 miles of Santiago was won. The advantage was steadily\r\nincreased. On July 1 a severe battle took place, our forces gaining the\r\noutworks of Santiago; on the 2d El Caney and San Juan were taken after a\r\ndesperate charge, and the investment of the city was completed. The Navy\r\ncooperated by shelling the town and the coast forts.\r\n\r\nOn the day following this brilliant achievement of our land forces, the 3d\r\nof July, occurred the decisive naval combat of the war. The Spanish fleet,\r\nattempting to leave the harbor, was met by the American squadron under\r\ncommand of Commodore Sampson. In less than three hours all the Spanish\r\nships were destroyed, the two torpedo boats being sunk and the Maria\r\nTeresa, Almirante Oquendo, Vizcaya, and Cristobal Colon driven ashore. The\r\nSpanish admiral and over 1,300 men were taken prisoners. While the enemy's\r\nloss of life was deplorably large, some 600 perishing, on our side but one\r\nman was killed, on the Brooklyn, and one man seriously wounded. Although\r\nour ships were repeatedly struck, not one was seriously injured. Where all\r\nso conspicuously distinguished themselves, from the commanders to the\r\ngunners and the unnamed heroes in the boiler rooms, each and all\r\ncontributing toward the achievement of this astounding victory, for which\r\nneither ancient nor modern history affords a parallel in the completeness\r\nof the event and the marvelous disproportion of casualties, it would be\r\ninvidious to single out any for especial honor. Deserved promotion has\r\nrewarded the more conspicuous actors. The nation's profoundest gratitude is\r\ndue to all of these brave men who by their skill and devotion in a few\r\nshort hours crushed the sea power of Spain and wrought a triumph whose\r\ndecisiveness and far-reaching consequences can scarcely be measured. Nor\r\ncan we be unmindful of the achievements of our builders, mechanics, and\r\nartisans for their skill in the construction of our war ships.\r\n\r\nWith the catastrophe of Santiago Spain's effort upon the ocean virtually\r\nceased. A spasmodic effort toward the end of June to send her Mediterranean\r\nfleet, under Admiral Camara, to relieve Manila was abandoned, the\r\nexpedition being recalled after it had passed through the Suez Canal.\r\n\r\nThe capitulation of Santiago followed. The city was closely besieged by\r\nland, while the entrance of our ships into the harbor cut off all relief on\r\nthat side. After a truce to allow of the removal of noncombatants\r\nprotracted negotiations continued from July 3 until July 15, when, under\r\nmenace of immediate assault, the preliminaries of surrender were agreed\r\nupon. On the 17th General Shafter occupied the city. The capitulation\r\nembraced the entire eastern end of Cuba. The number of Spanish soldiers\r\nsurrendering was 22,000, all of whom were subsequently conveyed to Spain at\r\nthe charge of the United States. The story of this successful campaign is\r\ntold in the report of the Secretary of War, which will be laid before you.\r\nThe individual valor of officers and soldiers was never more strikingly\r\nshown than in the several engagements leading to the surrender of Santiago,\r\nwhile the prompt movements and successive victories won instant and\r\nuniversal applause. To those who gained this complete triumph, which\r\nestablished the ascendency of the United States upon land as the fight off\r\nSantiago had fixed our supremacy on the seas, the earnest and lasting\r\ngratitude of the nation is unsparingly due. Nor should we alone remember\r\nthe gallantry of the living; the dead claim our tears, and our losses by\r\nbattle and disease must cloud any exultation at the result and teach us to\r\nweigh the awful cost of war, however rightful the cause or signal the\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\nWith the fall of Santiago the occupation of Puerto Rico became the next\r\nstrategic necessity. General Miles had previously been assigned to organize\r\nan expedition for that purpose. Fortunately he was already at Santiago,\r\nwhere he had arrived on the 11th of July with reenforcements for General\r\nShafter's army.\r\n\r\nWith these troops, consisting of 3,415 infantry and artillery, two\r\ncompanies of engineers, and one company of the Signal Corps, General Miles\r\nleft Guantanamo on July 21, having nine transports convoyed by the fleet\r\nunder Captain Higginson with the Massachusetts (flagship), Dixie,\r\nGloucester, Columbia, and Yale, the two latter carrying troops. The\r\nexpedition landed at Guanica July 25, which port was entered with little\r\nopposition. Here the fleet was joined by the Annapolis and the Wasp, while\r\nthe Puritan and Amphitrite went to San Juan and joined the New Orleans,\r\nwhich was engaged in blockading that port. The Major-General Commanding was\r\nsubsequently reenforced by General Schwan's brigade of the Third Army\r\nCorps, by General Wilson with a part of his division, and also by General\r\nBrooke with a part of his corps, numbering in all 16,973 officers and men.\r\n\r\nOn July 27 he entered Ponce, one of the most important ports in the island,\r\nfrom which he thereafter directed operations for the capture of the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of encounters with the enemy at Guayama, Hormigueros,\r\nCoamo, and Yauco and an attack on a force landed at Cape San Juan, there\r\nwas no serious resistance. The campaign was prosecuted with great vigor,\r\nand by the 12th of August much of the island was in our possession and the\r\nacquisition of the remainder was only a matter of a short time. At most of\r\nthe points in the island our troops were enthusiastically welcomed.\r\nProtestations of loyalty to the flag and gratitude for delivery from\r\nSpanish rule met our commanders at every stage. As a potent influence\r\ntoward peace the outcome of the Puerto Rican expedition was of great\r\nconsequence, and generous commendation is due to those who participated in\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe last scene of the war was enacted at Manila, its starting place. On\r\nAugust 15, after a brief assault upon the works by the land forces, in\r\nwhich the squadron assisted, the capital surrendered unconditionally. The\r\ncasualties were comparatively few. By this the conquest of the Philippine\r\nIslands, virtually accomplished when the Spanish capacity for resistance\r\nwas destroyed by Admiral Dewey's victory of the 1st of May, was formally\r\nsealed. To General Merrill, his officers and men, for their uncomplaining\r\nand devoted service and for their gallantry in action, the nation is\r\nsincerely grateful. Their long voyage was made with singular success, and\r\nthe soldierly conduct of the men, most of whom were without previous\r\nexperience in the military service, deserves unmeasured praise.\r\n\r\nThe total casualties in killed and wounded in the Army during the war with\r\nSpain were: Officers killed, 23; enlisted men killed, 257; total, 280;\r\nofficers wounded, 113; enlisted men wounded, 1,464; total, 1,577. Of the\r\nNavy: Killed, 17; wounded, 67; died as result of wounds, 1; invalided from\r\nservice, 6; total, 91.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that while our Navy was engaged in two great battles\r\nand in numerous perilous undertakings in blockade and bombardment, and more\r\nthan 50,000 of our troops were transported to distant lands and were\r\nengaged in assault and siege and battle and many skirmishes in unfamiliar\r\nterritory, we lost in both arms of the service a total of 1,668 killed and\r\nwounded; and in the entire campaign by land and sea we did not lose a gun\r\nor a flag or a transport or a ship, and, with the exception of the crew of\r\nthe Merrimac, not a soldier or sailor was taken prisoner.\r\n\r\nOn August 7, forty-six days from the date of the landing of General\r\nShafter's army in Cuba and twenty-one days from the surrender of Santiago,\r\nthe United States troops commenced embarkation for home, and our entire\r\nforce was returned to the United States as early as August 24. They were\r\nabsent from the United States only two months.\r\n\r\nIt is fitting that I should bear testimony to the patriotism and devotion\r\nof that large portion of our Army which, although eager to be ordered to\r\nthe post of greatest exposure, fortunately was not required outside of the\r\nUnited States. They did their whole duty, and, like their comrades at the\r\nfront, have earned the gratitude of the nation. In like manner, the\r\nofficers and men of the Army and of the Navy who remained in their\r\ndepartments and stations faithfully performing most important duties\r\nconnected with the war, and whose requests for assignment in the field and\r\nat sea I was compelled to refuse because their services were indispensable\r\nhere, are entitled to the highest commendation. It is my regret that there\r\nseems to be no provision for their suitable recognition.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it is a pleasure for me to mention in terms of cordial\r\nappreciation the timely and useful work of the American National Red Cross,\r\nboth in relief measures preparatory to the campaigns, in sanitary\r\nassistance at several of the camps of assemblage, and later, under the able\r\nand experienced leadership of the president of the society, Miss Clara\r\nBarton, on the fields of battle and in the hospitals at the front in Cuba.\r\nWorking in conjunction with the governmental authorities and under their\r\nsanction and approval, and with the enthusiastic cooperation of many\r\npatriotic women and societies in the various States, the Red Cross has\r\nfully maintained its already high reputation for intense earnestness and\r\nability to exercise the noble purposes of its international organization,\r\nthus justifying the confidence and support which it has received at the\r\nhands of the American people. To the members and officers of this society\r\nand all who aided them in their philanthropic work the sincere and lasting\r\ngratitude of the soldiers and the public is due and is freely accorded.\r\n\r\nIn tracing these events we are constantly reminded of our obligations to\r\nthe Divine Master for His watchful care over us and His safe guidance, for\r\nwhich the nation makes reverent acknowledgment and offers humble prayer for\r\nthe continuance of His favor.\r\n\r\nThe annihilation of Admiral Cervera's fleet, followed by the capitulation\r\nof Santiago, having brought to the Spanish Government a realizing sense of\r\nthe hopelessness of continuing a struggle now become wholly unequal, it\r\nmade overtures of peace through the French ambassador, who, with the assent\r\nof his Government, had acted as the friendly representative of Spanish\r\ninterests during the war. On the 26th of July M. Cambon presented a\r\ncommunication signed by the Duke of Almodovar, the Spanish minister of\r\nstate, inviting the United States to state the terms upon which it would be\r\nwilling to make peace. On the 30th of July, by a communication addressed to\r\nthe Duke of Almodovar and handed to M. Cambon, the terms of this Government\r\nwere announced substantially as in the protocol afterwards signed. On the\r\n10th of August the Spanish reply, dated August 7, was handed by M. Cambon\r\nto the Secretary of State. It accepted unconditionally the terms imposed as\r\nto Cuba, Puerto Rico, and an island of the Ladrones group, but appeared to\r\nseek to introduce inadmissible reservations in regard to our demand as to\r\nthe Philippine Islands. Conceiving that discussion on this point could\r\nneither be practical nor profitable, I directed that in order to avoid\r\nmisunderstanding the matter should be forthwith closed by proposing the\r\nembodiment in a formal protocol of the terms upon which the negotiations\r\nfor peace were to be undertaken. The vague and inexplicit suggestions of\r\nthe Spanish note could not be accepted, the only reply being to present as\r\na virtual ultimatum a draft of protocol embodying the precise terms\r\ntendered to Spain in our note of July 30, with added stipulations of detail\r\nas to the appointment of commissioners to arrange for the evacuation of the\r\nSpanish Antilles. On August 12 M. Cambon announced his receipt of full\r\npowers to sign the protocol so submitted. Accordingly, on the afternoon of\r\nAugust 12, M. Cambon, as the plenipotentiary of Spain, and the Secretary of\r\nState, as the plenipotentiary of the United States, signed a protocol\r\nproviding--\r\n\r\nARTICLE I. Spain will relinquish all claim of sovereignty over and title\r\nto Cuba.\r\n\r\nART. II. Spain will cede to the United States the island of Puerto Rico and\r\nother islands now under Spanish sovereignty in the West Indies, and also an\r\nisland in the Ladrones to be selected by the United States.\r\n\r\nART. III. The United States will occupy and hold the city, bay, and harbor\r\nof Manila pending the conclusion of a treaty of peace which shall determine\r\nthe control, disposition, and government of the Philippines. The fourth\r\narticle provided for the appointment of joint commissions on the part of\r\nthe United States and Spain, to meet in Havana and San Juan, respectively,\r\nfor the purpose of arranging and carrying out the details of the stipulated\r\nevacuation of Cuba, Puerto Rico, and other Spanish islands in the West\r\nIndies.\r\n\r\nThe fifth article provided for the appointment of not more than five\r\ncommissioners on each side, to meet at Paris not later than October 1 and\r\nto proceed to the negotiation and conclusion of a treaty of peace, subject\r\nto ratification according to the respective constitutional forms of the two\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nThe sixth and last article provided that upon the signature of the protocol\r\nhostilities between the two countries should be suspended and that notice\r\nto that effect should be given as soon as possible by each Government to\r\nthe commanders of its military and naval forces.\r\n\r\nImmediately upon the conclusion of the protocol I issued a proclamation, of\r\nAugust 12, suspending hostilities on the part of the United States. The\r\nnecessary orders to that end were at once given by telegraph. The blockade\r\nof the ports of Cuba and San Juan de Puerto Rico was in like manner raised.\r\nOn the 18th of August the muster out of 100,000 volunteers, or as near that\r\nnumber as was found to be practicable, was ordered.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of December 101,165 officers and men had been mustered out and\r\ndischarged from the service, and 9,002 more will be mustered out by the\r\n10th of this month; also a corresponding number of general and general\r\nstaff officers have been honorably discharged the service.\r\n\r\nThe military commissions to superintend the evacuation of Cuba, Puerto\r\nRico, and the adjacent islands were forthwith appointed--for Cuba,\r\nMajor-General James F. Wade, Rear-Admiral William T. Sampson, Major-General\r\nMatthew C. Butler; for Puerto Rico, Major--General John R. Brooke,\r\nRear-Admiral Winfield S. Schley, Brigadier-General William W. Gordon--who\r\nsoon afterwards met the Spanish commissioners at Havana and San Juan,\r\nrespectively. The Puerto Rican Joint Commission speedily accomplished its\r\ntask, and by the 18th of October the evacuation of the island was\r\ncompleted. The United States flag was raised over the island at noon on\r\nthat day. The administration of its affairs has been provisionally\r\nintrusted to a military governor until the Congress shall otherwise\r\nprovide. The Cuban Joint Commission has not yet terminated its labors.\r\nOwing to the difficulties in the way of removing the large numbers of\r\nSpanish troops still in Cuba, the evacuation can not be completed before\r\nthe 1st of January next.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the fifth article of the protocol, I appointed William R. Day,\r\nlately Secretary of State; Cushman K. Davis, William P. Frye, and George\r\nGray, Senators of the United States, and Whitelaw Reid to be the peace\r\ncommissioners on the part of the United States. Proceeding in due season to\r\nParis, they there met on the 1st of October five commissioners similarly\r\nappointed on the part of Spain. Their negotiations have made hopeful\r\nprogress, so that I trust soon to be able to lay a definitive treaty of\r\npeace before the Senate, with a review of the steps leading to its\r\nsignature.\r\n\r\nI do not discuss at this time the government or the future of the new\r\npossessions which will come to us as the result of the war with Spain. Such\r\ndiscussion will be appropriate after the treaty of peace shall be ratified.\r\nIn the meantime and until the Congress has legislated otherwise it will be\r\nmy duty to continue the military governments which have existed since our\r\noccupation and give to the people security in life and property and\r\nencouragement under a just and beneficent rule.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we are in possession of Cuba and have pacified the island it\r\nwill be necessary to give aid and direction to its people to form a\r\ngovernment for themselves. This should be undertaken at the earliest moment\r\nconsistent with safety and assured success. It is important that our\r\nrelations with this people shall be of the most friendly character and our\r\ncommercial relations close and reciprocal. It should be our duty to assist\r\nin every proper way to build up the waste places of the island, encourage\r\nthe industry of the people, and assist them to form a government which\r\nshall be free and independent, thus realizing the best aspirations of the\r\nCuban people.\r\n\r\nSpanish rule must be replaced by a just, benevolent, and humane government,\r\ncreated by the people of Cuba, capable of performing all international\r\nobligations, and which shall encourage thrift, industry, and prosperity and\r\npromote peace and good will among all of the inhabitants, whatever may have\r\nbeen their relations in the past. Neither revenge nor passion should have a\r\nplace in the new government. Until there is complete tranquillity in the\r\nisland and a stable government inaugurated military occupation will be\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\nWith the one exception of the rupture with Spain, the intercourse of the\r\nUnited States with the great family of nations has been marked with\r\ncordiality, and the close of the eventful year finds most of the issues\r\nthat necessarily arise in the complex relations of sovereign states\r\nadjusted or presenting no serious obstacle to a just and honorable solution\r\nby amicable agreement.\r\n\r\nA long unsettled dispute as to the extended boundary between the Argentine\r\nRepublic and Chile, stretching along the Andean crests from the southern\r\nborder of the Atacama Desert to Magellan Straits, nearly a third of the\r\nlength of the South American continent, assumed an acute stage in the early\r\npart of the year, and afforded to this Government occasion to express the\r\nhope that the resort to arbitration, already contemplated by existing\r\nconventions between the parties, might prevail despite the grave\r\ndifficulties arising in its application. I am happy to say that\r\narrangements to this end have been perfected, the questions of fact upon\r\nwhich the respective commissioners were unable to agree being in course of\r\nreference to Her Britannic Majesty for determination. A residual difference\r\ntouching the northern boundary line across the Atacama Desert, for which\r\nexisting treaties provided no adequate adjustment, bids fair to be settled\r\nin like manner by a joint commission, upon which the United States minister\r\nat Buenos Ayres has been invited to serve as umpire in the last resort.\r\n\r\nI have found occasion to approach the Argentine Government with a view to\r\nremoving differences of rate charges imposed upon the cables of an American\r\ncorporation in the transmission between Buenos Ayres and the cities of\r\nUruguay and Brazil of through messages passing from and to the United\r\nStates. Although the matter is complicated by exclusive concessions by\r\nUruguay and Brazil to foreign companies, there is strong hope that a good\r\nunderstanding will be reached and that the important channels of commercial\r\ncommunication between the United States and the Atlantic cities of South\r\nAmerica may be freed from an almost prohibitory discrimination.\r\n\r\nIn this relation I may be permitted to express my sense of the fitness of\r\nan international agreement whereby the interchange of messages over\r\nconnecting cables may be regulated on a fair basis of uniformity. The world\r\nhas seen the postal system developed from a congeries of independent and\r\nexclusive services into a well-ordered union, of which all countries enjoy\r\nthe manifold benefits. It would be strange were the nations not in time\r\nbrought to realize that modern civilization, which owes so much of its\r\nprogress to the annihilation of space by the electric force, demands that\r\nthis all-important means of communication be a heritage of all peoples, to\r\nbe administered and regulated in their common behoof. A step in this\r\ndirection was taken when the international convention of 1884 for the\r\nprotection of submarine cables was signed, and the day is, I trust, not far\r\ndistant when this medium for the transmission of thought from land to land\r\nmay be brought within the domain of international concert as completely as\r\nis the material carriage of commerce and correspondence upon the face of\r\nthe waters that divide them.\r\n\r\nThe claim of Thomas Jefferson Page against Argentina, which has been\r\npending many years, has been adjusted. The sum awarded by the Congress of\r\nArgentina was $4,242.35.\r\n\r\nThe sympathy of the American people has justly been offered to the ruler\r\nand the people of Austria-Hungary by reason of the affliction that has\r\nlately befallen them in the assassination of the Empress-Queen of that\r\nhistoric realm.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of September, 1897, a conflict took place at Lattimer, Pa.,\r\nbetween a body of striking miners and the sheriff of Luzerne County and his\r\ndeputies, in which 22 miners were killed and 44 wounded, of whom 10 of the\r\nkilled and 12 of the wounded were Austrian and Hungarian subjects. This\r\ndeplorable event naturally aroused the solicitude of the Austro-Hungarian\r\nGovernment, which, on the assumption that the killing and wounding involved\r\nthe unjustifiable misuse of authority, claimed reparation for the\r\nsufferers. Apart from the searching investigation and peremptory action of\r\nthe authorities of Pennsylvania, the Federal Executive took appropriate\r\nsteps to learn the merits of the case, in order to be in a position to meet\r\nthe urgent complaint of a friendly power. The sheriff and his deputies,\r\nhaving been indicted for murder, were tried, and acquitted, after\r\nprotracted proceedings and the hearing of hundreds of witnesses, on the\r\nground that the killing was in the line of their official duty to uphold\r\nlaw and preserve public order in the State. A representative of the\r\nDepartment of Justice attended the trial and reported its course fully.\r\nWith all the facts in its possession, this Government expects to reach a\r\nharmonious understanding on the subject with that of Austria-Hungary,\r\nnotwithstanding the renewed claim of the latter, after learning the result\r\nof the trial, for indemnity for its injured subjects.\r\n\r\nDespite the brief time allotted for preparation, the exhibits of this\r\ncountry at the Universal Exposition at Brussels in 1897 enjoyed the\r\nsingular distinction of a larger proportion of awards, having regard to the\r\nnumber and classes of articles entered than those of other countries. The\r\nworth of such a result in making known our national capacity to supply the\r\nworld's markets is obvious.\r\n\r\nExhibitions of this international character are becoming more frequent as\r\nthe exchanges of commercial countries grow more intimate and varied. Hardly\r\na year passes that this Government is not invited to national participation\r\nat some important foreign center, but often on too short notice to permit\r\nof recourse to Congress for the power and means to do so. My predecessors\r\nhave suggested the advisability of providing by a general enactment and a\r\nstanding appropriation for accepting such invitations and for\r\nrepresentation of this country by a commission. This plan has my cordial\r\napproval.\r\n\r\nI trust that the Belgian restrictions on the importation of cattle from the\r\nUnited States, originally adopted as a sanitary precaution, will at an\r\nearly day be relaxed as to their present features of hardship and\r\ndiscrimination, so as to admit live cattle under due regulation of their\r\nslaughter after landing. I am hopeful, too, of favorable change in the\r\nBelgian treatment of our preserved and salted meats. The growth of direct\r\ntrade between the two countries, not alone for Belgian consumption and\r\nBelgian products, but by way of transit from and to other continental\r\nstates, has been both encouraging and beneficial. No effort will be spared\r\nto enlarge its advantages by seeking the removal of needless impediments\r\nand by arrangements for increased commercial exchanges.\r\n\r\nThe year's events in Central America deserve more than passing mention.\r\n\r\nA menacing rupture between Costa Rica and Nicaragua was happily composed by\r\nthe signature of a convention between the parties, with the concurrence of\r\nthe Guatemalan representative as a mediator, the act being negotiated and\r\nsigned on board the United States steamer Alert, then lying in Central\r\nAmerican waters. It is believed that the good offices of our envoy and of\r\nthe commander of that vessel contributed toward this gratifying outcome.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message the situation was presented with respect to the\r\ndiplomatic representation of this Government in Central America created by\r\nthe association of Nicaragua, Honduras, and Salvador under the title of the\r\nGreater Republic of Central America, and the delegation of their\r\ninternational functions to the Diet thereof. While the representative\r\ncharacter of the Diet was recognized by my predecessor and has been\r\nconfirmed during my Administration by receiving its accredited envoy and\r\ngranting exequaturs to consuls commissioned under its authority, that\r\nrecognition was qualified by the distinct understanding that the\r\nresponsibility of each of the component sovereign Republics toward the\r\nUnited States remained wholly unaffected.\r\n\r\nThis proviso was needful inasmuch as the compact of the three Republics was\r\nat the outset an association whereby certain representative functions were\r\ndelegated to a tripartite commission rather than a federation possessing\r\ncentralized powers of government and administration. In this view of their\r\nrelation and of the relation of the United States to the several Republics,\r\na change in the representation of this country in Central America was\r\nneither recommended by the Executive nor initiated by Congress, thus\r\nleaving one of our envoys accredited, as heretofore, separately to two\r\nStates of the Greater Republic, Nicaragua and Salvador, and to a third\r\nState, Costa Rica, which was not a party to the compact, while our other\r\nenvoy was similarly accredited to a union State, Honduras, and a nonunion\r\nState, Guatemala. The result has been that the one has presented\r\ncredentials only to the President of Costa Rica, the other having been\r\nreceived only by the Government of Guatemala.\r\n\r\nSubsequently the three associated Republics entered into negotiations for\r\ntaking the steps forecast in the original compact. A convention of their\r\ndelegates framed for them a federal constitution under the name of the\r\nUnited States of Central America, and provided for a central federal\r\ngovernment and legislature. Upon ratification by the constituent States,\r\nthe 1st of November last was fixed for the new system to go into operation.\r\nWithin a few weeks thereafter the plan was severely tested by revolutionary\r\nmovements arising, with a consequent demand for unity of action on the part\r\nof the military power of the federal States to suppress them. Under this\r\nstrain the new union seems to have been weakened through the withdrawal of\r\nits more important members. This Government was not officially advised of\r\nthe installation of the federation and has maintained an attitude of\r\nfriendly expectancy, while in no wise relinquishing the position held from\r\nthe outset that the responsibilities of the several States toward us\r\nremained unaltered by their tentative relations among themselves.\r\n\r\nThe Nicaragua Canal Commission, under the chairmanship of Rear-Admiral John\r\nG. Walker, appointed July 24, 1897, under the authority of a provision in\r\nthe sundry civil act of June 4 of that year, has nearly completed its\r\nlabors, and the results of its exhaustive inquiry into the proper route,\r\nthe feasibility, and the cost of construction of an interoceanic canal by a\r\nNicaraguan route will be laid before you. In the performance of its task\r\nthe commission received all possible courtesy and assistance from the\r\nGovernments of Nicaragua and Costa Rica, which thus testified their\r\nappreciation of the importance of giving a speedy and practical outcome to\r\nthe great project that has for so many years engrossed the attention of the\r\nrespective countries.\r\n\r\nAs the scope of the recent inquiry embraced the whole subject, with the aim\r\nof making plans and surveys for a canal by the most convenient route, it\r\nnecessarily included a review of the results of previous surveys and plans,\r\nand in particular those adopted by the Maritime Canal Company under its\r\nexisting concessions from Nicaragua and Costa Rica, so that to this extent\r\nthose grants necessarily hold as essential a part in the deliberations and\r\nconclusions of the Canal Commission as they have held and must needs hold\r\nin the discussion of the matter by the Congress. Under these circumstances\r\nand in view of overtures made to the Governments of Nicaragua and Costa\r\nRica by other parties for a new canal concession predicated on the assumed\r\napproaching lapse of the contracts of the Maritime Canal Company with those\r\nStates, I have not hesitated to express my conviction that considerations\r\nof expediency and international policy as between the several governments\r\ninterested in the construction and control of an interoceanic canal by this\r\nroute require the maintenance of the status quo until the Canal Commission\r\nshall have reported and the United States Congress shall have had the\r\nopportunity to pass finally upon the whole matter during the present\r\nsession, without prejudice by reason of any change in the existing\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it appears that the Government of Nicaragua, as one of its\r\nlast sovereign acts before merging its powers in those of the newly formed\r\nUnited States of Central America, has granted an optional concession to\r\nanother association, to become effective on the expiration of the present\r\ngrant. It does not appear what surveys have been made or what route is\r\nproposed under this contingent grant, so that an examination of the\r\nfeasibility of its plans is necessarily not embraced in the report of the\r\nCanal Commission. All these circumstances suggest the urgency of some\r\ndefinite action by the Congress at this session if the labors of the past\r\nare to be utilized and the linking of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans by a\r\npractical waterway is to be realized. That the construction of such a\r\nmaritime highway is now more than ever indispensable to that intimate and\r\nready intercommunication between our eastern and western seaboards demanded\r\nby the annexation of the Hawaiian Islands and the prospective expansion of\r\nour influence and commerce in the Pacific, and that our national policy now\r\nmore imperatively than ever calls for its control by this Government, are\r\npropositions which I doubt not the Congress will duly appreciate and wisely\r\nact upon.\r\n\r\nA convention providing for the revival of the late United States and\r\nChilean Claims Commission and the consideration of claims which were duly\r\npresented to the late commission, but not considered because of the\r\nexpiration of the time limited for the duration of the commission, was\r\nsigned May 24, 1897, and has remained unacted upon by the Senate. The term\r\ntherein fixed for effecting the exchange of ratifications having elapsed,\r\nthe convention falls unless the time be extended by amendment, which I am\r\nendeavoring to bring about, with the friendly concurrence of the Chilean\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThe United States has not been an indifferent spectator of the\r\nextraordinary events transpiring in the Chinese Empire, whereby portions of\r\nits maritime provinces are passing under the control of various European\r\npowers; but the prospect that the vast commerce which the energy of our\r\ncitizens and the necessity of our staple productions for Chinese uses has\r\nbuilt up in those regions may not be prejudiced through any exclusive\r\ntreatment by the new occupants has obviated the need of our country\r\nbecoming an actor in the scene. Our position among nations, having a large\r\nPacific coast and a constantly expanding direct trade with the farther\r\nOrient, gives us the equitable claim to consideration and friendly\r\ntreatment in this regard, and it will be my aim to subserve our large\r\ninterests in that quarter by all means appropriate to the constant policy\r\nof our Government. The territories of Kiao-chow, of Wei-hai-wei, and of\r\nPort Arthur and Talienwan, leased to Germany, Great Britain, and Russia,\r\nrespectively, for terms of years, will, it is announced, be open to\r\ninternational commerce during such alien occupation; and if no\r\ndiscriminating treatment of American citizens and their trade be found to\r\nexist or be hereafter developed, the desire of this Government would appear\r\nto be realized.\r\n\r\nIn this relation, as showing the volume and value of our exchanges with\r\nChina and the peculiarly favorable conditions which exist for their\r\nexpansion in the normal course of trade, I refer to the communication\r\naddressed to the Speaker of the House of Representatives by the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury on the 14th of last June, with its accompanying letter of\r\nthe Secretary of State, recommending an appropriation for a commission to\r\nstudy the commercial and industrial conditions in the Chinese Empire and\r\nreport as to the opportunities for and obstacles to the enlargement of\r\nmarkets in China for the raw products and manufactures of the United\r\nStates. Action was not taken thereon during the late session. I cordially\r\nurge that the recommendation receive at your hands the consideration which\r\nits importance and timeliness merit.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile there may be just ground for disquietude in view of the unrest\r\nand revival of the old sentiment of opposition and prejudice to alien\r\npeople which pervades certain of the Chinese provinces. As in the case of\r\nthe attacks upon our citizens in Szechuen and at Kutien in 1895, the United\r\nStates minister has been instructed to secure the fullest measure of\r\nprotection, both local and imperial, for any menaced American interests,\r\nand to demand, in case of lawless injury to person or property, instant\r\nreparation appropriate to the case. War ships have been stationed at\r\nTientsin for more ready observation of the disorders which have invaded\r\neven the Chinese capital, so as to be in a position to act should need\r\narise, while a guard of marines has been sent to Peking to afford the\r\nminister the same measure of authoritative protection as the\r\nrepresentatives of other nations have been constrained to employ.\r\n\r\nFollowing close upon the rendition of the award of my predecessor as\r\narbitrator of the claim of the Italian subject Cerruti against the Republic\r\nof Colombia, differences arose between the parties to the arbitration in\r\nregard to the scope and extension of the award, of which certain articles\r\nwere contested by Colombia, while Italy claimed their literal fulfillment.\r\nThe award having been made by the President of the United States, as an act\r\nof friendly consideration and with the sole view to an impartial\r\ncomposition of the matter in dispute, I could not but feel deep concern at\r\nsuch a miscarriage, and while unable to accept the Colombian theory that I,\r\nin my official capacity, possessed continuing functions as arbitrator, with\r\npower to interpret or revise the terms of the award, my best efforts were\r\nlent to bring the parties to a harmonious agreement as to the execution of\r\nits provisions.\r\n\r\nA naval demonstration by Italy resulted in an engagement to pay the\r\nliabilities claimed upon their ascertainment; but this apparent disposition\r\nof the controversy was followed by a rupture of diplomatic intercourse\r\nbetween Colombia and Italy, which still continues, although, fortunately,\r\nwithout acute symptoms having supervened. Notwithstanding this, efforts are\r\nreported to be continuing for the ascertainment of Colombia's contingent\r\nliability on account of Cerruti's debts under the fifth article of the\r\naward.\r\n\r\nA claim of an American citizen against the Dominican Republic for a public\r\nbridge over the Ozama River, which has been in diplomatic controversy for\r\nseveral years, has been settled by expert arbitration and an award in favor\r\nof the claimant amounting to about $90,000. It, however, remains unpaid,\r\ndespite urgent demands for its settlement according to the terms of the\r\ncompact.\r\n\r\nThere is now every prospect that the participation of the United States in\r\nthe Universal Exposition to be held in Paris in 1900 will be on a scale\r\ncommensurate with the advanced position held by our products and industries\r\nin the world's chief marts.\r\n\r\nThe preliminary report of Mr. Moses P. Handy, who, under the act approved\r\nJuly 19, 1897, was appointed special commissioner with a view to securing\r\nall attainable information necessary to a full and complete understanding\r\nby Congress in regard to the participation of this Government in the Paris\r\nExposition, was laid before you by my message of December 6, 1897, and\r\nshowed the large opportunities opened to make known our national progress\r\nin arts, science, and manufactures, as well as the urgent need of immediate\r\nand adequate provision to enable due advantage thereof to be taken. Mr.\r\nHandy's death soon afterwards rendered it necessary for another to take up\r\nand complete his unfinished work, and on January 11 last Mr. Thomas W.\r\nCridler, Third Assistant Secretary of State, was designated to fulfill that\r\ntask. His report was laid before you by my message of June 14, 1898, with\r\nthe gratifying result of awakening renewed interest in the projected\r\ndisplay. By a provision in the sundry civil appropriation act of July 1,\r\n1898, a sum not to exceed $650,000 was allotted for the organization of a\r\ncommission to care for the proper preparation and installation of American\r\nexhibits and for the display of suitable exhibits by the several Executive\r\nDepartments, particularly by the Department of Agriculture, the Fish\r\nCommission, and the Smithsonian Institution, in representation of the\r\nGovernment of the United States.\r\n\r\nPursuant to that enactment I appointed Mr. Ferdinand W. Peck, of Chicago,\r\ncommissioner-general, with an assistant commissioner-general and a\r\nsecretary. Mr. Peck at once proceeded to Paris, where his success in\r\nenlarging the scope and variety of the United States exhibit has been most\r\ngratifying. Notwithstanding the comparatively limited area of the\r\nexposition site--less than one-half that of the World's Fair at\r\nChicago--the space assigned to the United States has been increased from\r\nthe absolute allotment of 157,403 square feet reported by Mr. Handy to some\r\n202,000 square feet, with corresponding augmentation of the field for a\r\ntruly characteristic representation of the various important branches of\r\nour country's development. Mr. Peck's report will be laid before you. In my\r\njudgment its recommendations will call for your early consideration,\r\nespecially as regards an increase of the appropriation to at least one\r\nmillion dollars in all, so that not only may the assigned space be fully\r\ntaken up by the best possible exhibits in every class, but the preparation\r\nand installation be on so perfect a scale as to rank among the first in\r\nthat unparalleled competition of artistic and inventive production, and\r\nthus counterbalance the disadvantage with which we start as compared with\r\nother countries whose appropriations are on a more generous scale and whose\r\npreparations are in a state of much greater forwardness than our own.\r\n\r\nWhere our artisans have the admitted capacity to excel, where our inventive\r\ngenius has initiated many of the grandest discoveries of these later days\r\nof the century, and where the native resources of our land are as limitless\r\nas they are valuable to supply the world's needs, it is our province, as it\r\nshould be our earnest care, to lead in the march of human progress, and not\r\nrest content with any secondary place. Moreover, if this be due to\r\nourselves, it is no less due to the great French nation whose guests we\r\nbecome, and which has in so many ways testified its wish and hope that our\r\nparticipation shall befit the place the two peoples have won in the field\r\nof universal development.\r\n\r\nThe commercial arrangement made with France on the 28th of May, 1898, under\r\nthe provisions of section 3 of the tariff act of 1897, went into effect on\r\nthe 1st day of June following. It has relieved a portion of our export\r\ntrade from serious embarrassment. Further negotiations are now pending\r\nunder section 4 of the same act with a view to the increase of trade\r\nbetween the two countries to their mutual advantage. Negotiations with\r\nother governments, in part interrupted by the war with Spain, are in\r\nprogress under both sections of the tariff act. I hope to be able to\r\nannounce some of the results of these negotiations during the present\r\nsession of Congress.\r\n\r\nNegotiations to the same end with Germany have been set on foot. Meanwhile\r\nno effort has been relaxed to convince the Imperial Government of the\r\nthoroughness of our inspection of pork products for exportation, and it is\r\ntrusted that the efficient administration of this measure by the Department\r\nof Agriculture will be recognized as a guaranty of the healthfulness of the\r\nfood staples we send abroad to countries where their use is large and\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nI transmitted to the Senate on the 10th of February last information\r\ntouching the prohibition against the importation of fresh fruits from this\r\ncountry, which had then recently been decreed by Germany on the ground of\r\ndanger of disseminating the San Jose scale insect. This precautionary\r\nmeasure was justified by Germany on the score of the drastic steps taken in\r\nseveral States of the Union against the spread of the pest, the elaborate\r\nreports of the Department of Agriculture being put in evidence to show the\r\ndanger to German fruit-growing interests should the scale obtain a lodgment\r\nin that country. Temporary relief was afforded in the case of large\r\nconsignments of fruit then on the way by inspection and admission when\r\nfound noninfected. Later the prohibition was extended to dried fruits of\r\nevery kind, but was relaxed so as to apply only to unpeeled fruit and fruit\r\nwaste. As was to be expected, the alarm reached to other countries, and\r\nSwitzerland has adopted a similar inhibition. Efforts are in progress to\r\ninduce the German and Swiss Governments to relax the prohibition in favor\r\nof dried fruits shown to have been cured under circumstances rendering the\r\nexistence of animal life impossible.\r\n\r\nOur relations with Great Britain have continued on the most friendly\r\nfooting. Assenting to our request, the protection of Americans and their\r\ninterests in Spanish jurisdiction was assumed by the diplomatic and\r\nconsular representatives of Great Britain, who fulfilled their delicate and\r\narduous trust with tact and zeal, eliciting high commendation. I may be\r\nallowed to make fitting allusion to the instance of Mr. Ramsden, Her\r\nMajesty's consul at Santiago de Cuba, whose untimely death after\r\ndistinguished service and untiring effort during the siege of that city was\r\nsincerely lamented.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of April last, pursuant to a request made at the instance\r\nof the Secretary of State by the British ambassador at this capital, the\r\nCanadian government granted facilities for the passage of four United\r\nStates revenue cutters from the Great Lakes to the Atlantic coast by way of\r\nthe Canadian canals and the St. Lawrence River. The vessels had reached\r\nLake Ontario and were there awaiting the opening of navigation when war was\r\ndeclared between the United States and Spain. Her Majesty's Government\r\nthereupon, by a communication of the latter part of April, stated that the\r\npermission granted before the outbreak of hostilities would not be\r\nwithdrawn provided the United States Government gave assurance that the\r\nvessels in question would proceed direct to a United States port without\r\nengaging in any hostile operation. This Government promptly agreed to the\r\nstipulated condition, it being understood that the vessels would not be\r\nprohibited from resisting any hostile attack.\r\n\r\nIt will give me especial satisfaction if I shall be authorized to\r\ncommunicate to you a favorable conclusion of the pending negotiations with\r\nGreat Britain in respect to the Dominion of Canada. It is the earnest wish\r\nof this Government to remove all sources of discord and irritation in our\r\nrelations with the neighboring Dominion. The trade between the two\r\ncountries is constantly increasing, and it is important to both countries\r\nthat all reasonable facilities should be granted for its development.\r\n\r\nThe Government of Greece strongly urges the onerousness of the duty here\r\nimposed upon the currants of that country, amounting to 100 per cent or\r\nmore of their market value. This fruit is stated to be exclusively a Greek\r\nproduct, not coming into competition with any domestic product. The\r\nquestion of reciprocal commercial relations with Greece, including the\r\nrestoration of currants to the free list, is under consideration.\r\n\r\nThe long-standing claim of Bernard Campbell for damages for injuries\r\nsustained from a violent assault committed against him by military\r\nauthorities in the island of Haiti has been settled by the agreement of\r\nthat Republic to pay him $10,000 in American gold. Of this sum $5,000 has\r\nalready been paid. It is hoped that other pending claims of American\r\ncitizens against that Republic may be amicably adjusted.\r\n\r\nPending the consideration by the Senate of the treaty signed June 1897, by\r\nthe plenipotentiaries of the United States and of the Republic of Hawaii,\r\nproviding for the annexation of the islands, a joint resolution to\r\naccomplish the same purpose by accepting the offered cession and\r\nincorporating the ceded territory into the Union was adopted by the\r\nCongress and approved July 7, 1898. I thereupon directed the United States\r\nsteamship Philadelphia to convey Rear-Admiral Miller to Honolulu, and\r\nintrusted to his hands this important legislative act, to be delivered to\r\nthe President of the Republic of Hawaii, with whom the Admiral and the\r\nUnited States minister were authorized to make appropriate arrangements for\r\ntransferring the sovereignty of the islands to the United States. This was\r\nsimply but impressively accomplished on the 12th of August last by the\r\ndelivery of a certified copy of the resolution to President Dole, who\r\nthereupon yielded up to the representative of the Government of the United\r\nStates the sovereignty and public property of the Hawaiian Islands.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the terms of the joint resolution and in exercise of the\r\nauthority thereby conferred upon me, I directed that the civil, judicial,\r\nand military powers theretofore exercised by the officers of the Government\r\nof the Republic of Hawaii should continue to be exercised by those officers\r\nuntil Congress shall provide a government for the incorporated territory,\r\nsubject to my power to remove such officers and to fill vacancies. The\r\nPresident, officers, and troops of the Republic thereupon took the oath of\r\nallegiance to the United States, thus providing for the uninterrupted\r\ncontinuance of all the administrative and municipal functions of the\r\nannexed territory until Congress shall otherwise enact.\r\n\r\nFollowing the further provision of the joint resolution, I appointed the\r\nHons. Shelby M. Cullom, of Illinois, John T. Morgan, of Alabama, Robert R.\r\nHitt, of Illinois, Sanford B. Dole, of Hawaii, and Walter F. Frear, of\r\nHawaii, as commissioners to confer and recommend to Congress such\r\nlegislation concerning the Hawaiian Islands as they should deem necessary\r\nor proper. The commissioners having fulfilled the mission confided to them,\r\ntheir report will be laid before you at an early day. It is believed that\r\ntheir recommendations will have the earnest consideration due to the\r\nmagnitude of the responsibility resting upon you to give such shape to the\r\nrelationship of those mid-Pacific lands to our home Union as will benefit\r\nboth in the highest degree, realizing the aspirations of the community that\r\nhas cast its lot with us and elected to share our political heritage, while\r\nat the same time justifying the foresight of those who for three-quarters\r\nof a century have looked to the assimilation of Hawaii as a natural and\r\ninevitable consummation, in harmony with our needs and in fulfillment of\r\nour cherished traditions.\r\n\r\nThe questions heretofore pending between Hawaii and Japan growing out of\r\nthe alleged mistreatment of Japanese treaty immigrants were, I am pleased\r\nto say, adjusted before the act of transfer by the payment of a reasonable\r\nindemnity to the Government of Japan.\r\n\r\nUnder the provisions of the joint resolution, the existing customs\r\nrelations of the Hawaiian Islands with the United States and with other\r\ncountries remain unchanged until legislation shall otherwise provide. The\r\nconsuls of Hawaii here and in foreign countries continue to fulfill their\r\ncommercial agencies, while the United States consulate at Honolulu is\r\nmaintained for all appropriate services pertaining to trade and the\r\nrevenue. It would be desirable that all foreign consuls in the Hawaiian\r\nIslands should receive new exequaturs from this Government.\r\n\r\nThe attention of Congress is called to the fact that, our consular offices\r\nhaving ceased to exist in Hawaii and being about to cease in other\r\ncountries coming under the sovereignty of the United States, the provisions\r\nfor the relief and transportation of destitute American seamen in these\r\ncountries under our consular regulations will in consequence terminate. It\r\nis proper, therefore, that new legislation should be enacted upon this\r\nsubject in order to meet the changed conditions.\r\n\r\nThe interpretation of certain provisions of the extradition convention of\r\nDecember 11, 1861, has been at various times the occasion of controversy\r\nwith the Government of Mexico. An acute difference arose in the case of the\r\nMexican demand for the delivery of Jesus Guerra, who, having led a\r\nmarauding expedition near the border with the proclaimed purpose of\r\ninitiating an insurrection against President Diaz, escaped into Texas.\r\nExtradition was refused on the ground that the alleged offense was\r\npolitical in its character, and therefore came within the treaty proviso of\r\nnonsurrender. The Mexican contention was that the exception only related to\r\npurely political offenses, and that as Guerra's acts were admixed with the\r\ncommon crime of murder, arson, kidnaping, and robbery, the option of\r\nnondelivery became void, a position which this Government was unable to\r\nadmit in view of the received international doctrine and practice in the\r\nmatter. The Mexican Government, in view of this, gave notice January 24,\r\n1898, of the termination of the convention, to take effect twelve months\r\nfrom that date, at the same time inviting the conclusion of a new\r\nconvention, toward which negotiations are on foot.\r\n\r\nIn this relation I may refer to the necessity of some amendment of our\r\nexisting extradition statute. It is a common stipulation of such treaties\r\nthat neither party shall be bound to give up its own citizens, with the\r\nadded proviso in one of our treaties, that with Japan, that it may\r\nsurrender if it see fit. It is held in this country by an almost uniform\r\ncourse of decisions that where a treaty negatives the obligation to\r\nsurrender the President is not invested with legal authority to act. The\r\nconferment of such authority would be in the line of that sound morality\r\nwhich shrinks from affording secure asylum to the author of a heinous\r\ncrime. Again, statutory provision might well be made for what is styled\r\nextradition by way of transit, whereby a fugitive surrendered by one\r\nforeign government to another may be conveyed across the territory of the\r\nUnited States to the jurisdiction of the demanding state. A recommendation\r\nin this behalf made in the President's message of 1886 was not acted upon.\r\nThe matter is presented for your consideration.\r\n\r\nThe problem of the Mexican free zone has been often discussed with regard\r\nto its inconvenience as a provocative of smuggling into the United States\r\nalong an extensive and thinly guarded land border. The effort made by the\r\njoint resolution of March 1, 1895, to remedy the abuse charged by\r\nsuspending the privilege of free transportation in bond across the\r\nterritory of the United States to Mexico failed of good result, as is\r\nstated in Report No. 702 of the House of Representatives, submitted in the\r\nlast session, March 11, 1898. As the question is one to be conveniently met\r\nby wise concurrent legislation of the two countries looking to the\r\nprotection of the revenues by harmonious measures operating equally on\r\neither side of the boundary, rather than by conventional arrangements, I\r\nsuggest that Congress consider the advisability of authorizing and inviting\r\na conference of representatives of the Treasury Departments of the United\r\nStates and Mexico to consider the subject in all its complex bearings, and\r\nmake report with pertinent recommendations to the respective Governments\r\nfor the information and consideration of their Congresses.\r\n\r\nThe Mexican Water Boundary Commission has adjusted all matters submitted to\r\nit to the satisfaction of both Governments save in three important\r\ncases--that of the \"Chamizal\" at El Paso, Tex., where the two commissioners\r\nfailed to agree, and wherein, for this case only, this Government has\r\nproposed to Mexico the addition of a third member; the proposed elimination\r\nof what are known as \"Bancos,\" small isolated islands formed by the cutting\r\noff of bends in the Rio Grande, from the operation of the treaties of 1884\r\nand 1889, recommended by the commissioners and approved by this Government,\r\nbut still under consideration by Mexico; and the subject of the \"Equitable\r\ndistribution of the waters of the Rio Grande,\" for which the commissioners\r\nrecommended an international dam and reservoir, approved by Mexico, but\r\nstill under consideration by this Government. Pending these questions it is\r\nnecessary to extend the life of the commission, which expires December 23\r\nnext.\r\n\r\nThe coronation of the young Queen of the Netherlands was made the occasion\r\nof fitting congratulations.\r\n\r\nThe claim of Victor H. McCord against Peru, which for a number of years has\r\nbeen pressed by this Government and has on several occasions attracted the\r\nattention of the Congress, has been satisfactorily adjusted. A protocol was\r\nsigned May 17, 1898, whereby, the fact of liability being admitted, the\r\nquestion of the amount to be awarded was submitted to the chief justice of\r\nCanada as sole arbitrator. His award sets the indemnity due the claimant at\r\n$40,000.\r\n\r\nThe Government of Peru has given the prescribed notification of its\r\nintention to abrogate the treaty of friendship, commerce, and navigation\r\nconcluded with this country August 31, 1887. As that treaty contains many\r\nimportant provisions necessary to the maintenance of commerce and good\r\nrelations, which could with difficulty be replaced by the negotiation of\r\nrenewed provisions within the brief twelve months intervening before the\r\ntreaty terminates, I have invited suggestions by Peru as to the particular\r\nprovisions it is desired to annul, in the hope of reaching an arrangement\r\nwhereby the remaining articles may be provisionally saved.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty the Czar having announced his purpose to raise the Imperial\r\nRussian mission at this capital to the rank of an embassy, I responded,\r\nunder the authority conferred by the act of March 3, 1893, by commissioning\r\nand accrediting the actual representative at St. Petersburg in the capacity\r\nof ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary. The Russian ambassador to\r\nthis country has since presented his credentials.\r\n\r\nThe proposal of the Czar for a general reduction of the vast military\r\nestablishments that weigh so heavily upon many peoples in time of peace was\r\ncommunicated to this Government with an earnest invitation to be\r\nrepresented in the conference which it is contemplated to assemble with a\r\nview to discussing the means of accomplishing so desirable a result. His\r\nMajesty was at once informed of the cordial sympathy of this Government\r\nwith the principle involved in his exalted proposal and of the readiness of\r\nthe United States to take part in the conference. The active military force\r\nof the United States, as measured by our population, territorial area, and\r\ntaxable wealth, is, and under any conceivable prospective conditions must\r\ncontinue to be, in time of peace so conspicuously less than that of the\r\narmed powers to whom the Czar's appeal is especially addressed that the\r\nquestion can have for us no practical importance save as marking an\r\nauspicious step toward the betterment of the condition of the modern\r\npeoples and the cultivation of peace and good will among them; but in this\r\nview it behooves us as a nation to lend countenance and aid to the\r\nbeneficent project.\r\n\r\nThe claims of owners of American sealing vessels for seizure by Russian\r\ncruisers in Bering Sea are being pressed to a settlement. The equities of\r\nthe cases justify the expectation that a measure of reparation will\r\neventually be accorded in harmony with precedent and in the light of the\r\nproven facts.\r\n\r\nThe recommendation made in my special message of April 27 last is renewed,\r\nthat appropriation be made to reimburse the master and owners of the\r\nRussian bark Hans for wrongful arrest of the master and detention of the\r\nvessel in February, 1896, by officers of the United States district court\r\nfor the southern district of Mississippi. The papers accompanying my said\r\nmessage make out a most meritorious claim and justify the urgency with\r\nwhich it has been presented by the Government of Russia.\r\n\r\nMalietoa Laupepa, King of Samoa, died on August 22 last. According to\r\nArticle I of the general act of Berlin, \"his successor shall be duly\r\nelected according to the laws and customs of Samoa.\"\r\n\r\nArrangements having been agreed upon between the signatories of the general\r\nact for the return of Mataafa and the other exiled Samoan chiefs, they were\r\nbrought from Jaluit by a German war vessel and landed at Apia on September\r\n18 last.\r\n\r\nWhether the death of Malietoa and the return of his old-time rival Mataafa\r\nwill add to the undesirable complications which the execution of the\r\ntripartite general act has heretofore developed remains to be seen. The\r\nefforts of this Government will, as heretofore, be addressed toward a\r\nharmonious and exact fulfillment of the terms of the international\r\nengagement to which the United States became a party in 1889.\r\n\r\nThe Cheek claim against Siam, after some five years of controversy, has\r\nbeen adjusted by arbitration under an agreement signed July 6, 1897, an\r\naward of 706,721 ticals (about $187,987.78 ), with release of the Cheek\r\nestate from mortgage claims, having been rendered March 21, 1898, in favor\r\nof the claimant by the arbitrator, Sir Nicholas John Hannen, British chief\r\njustice for China and Japan.\r\n\r\nAn envoy from Siam has been accredited to this Government and has presented\r\nhis credentials.\r\n\r\nImmediately upon the outbreak of the war with Spain the Swiss Government,\r\nfulfilling the high mission it has deservedly assumed as the patron of the\r\nInternational Red Cross, proposed to the United States and Spain that they\r\nshould severally recognize and carry into execution, as a modus vivendi,\r\nduring the continuance of hostilities, the additional articles proposed by\r\nthe international conference of Geneva, October 20, 1868, extending the\r\neffects of the existing Red Cross convention of 1864 to the conduct of\r\nnaval war. Following the example set by France and Germany in 1870 in\r\nadopting such a modus vivendi, and in view of the accession of the United\r\nStates to those additional articles in 1882, although the exchange of\r\nratifications thereof still remained uneffected, the Swiss proposal was\r\npromptly and cordially accepted by us, and simultaneously by Spain.\r\n\r\nThis Government feels a keen satisfaction in having thus been enabled to\r\ntestify its adherence to the broadest principles of humanity even amidst\r\nthe clash of war, and it is to be hoped that the extension of the Red Cross\r\ncompact to hostilities by sea as well as on land may soon become an\r\naccomplished fact through the general promulgation of the additional naval\r\nRed Cross articles by the maritime powers now parties to the convention of\r\n1864.\r\n\r\nThe important question of the claim of Switzerland to the perpetual\r\ncantonal allegiance of American citizens of Swiss origin has not made\r\nhopeful progress toward a solution, and controversies in this regard still\r\ncontinue.\r\n\r\nThe newly accredited envoy of the United States to the Ottoman Porte\r\ncarries instructions looking to the disposal of matters in controversy with\r\nTurkey for a number of years. He is especially charged to press for a just\r\nsettlement of our claims for indemnity by reason of the destruction of the\r\nproperty of American missionaries resident in that country during the\r\nArmenian troubles of 1895, as well as for the recognition of older claims\r\nof equal justness.\r\n\r\nHe is also instructed to seek an adjustment of the dispute growing out of\r\nthe refusal of Turkey to recognize the acquired citizenship of Ottoman-born\r\npersons naturalized in the United States since 1869 without prior imperial\r\nconsent, and in the same general relation he is directed to endeavor to\r\nbring about a solution of the question which has more or less acutely\r\nexisted since 1869 concerning the jurisdictional rights of the United\r\nStates in matters of criminal procedure and punishment under Article IV of\r\nthe treaty of 1830. This latter difficulty grows out of a verbal\r\ndifference, claimed by Turkey to be essential, between the original Turkish\r\ntext and the promulgated translation.\r\n\r\nAfter more than two years from the appointment of a consul of this country\r\nto Erzerum, he has received his exequatur.\r\n\r\nThe arbitral tribunal appointed under the treaty of February 2, 1897,\r\nbetween Great Britain and Venezuela, to determine the boundary line between\r\nthe latter and the colony of British Guiana, is to convene at Paris during\r\nthe present month. It is a source of much gratification to this Government\r\nto see the friendly resort of arbitration applied to the settlement of this\r\ncontroversy, not alone because of the earnest part we have had in bringing\r\nabout the result, but also because the two members named on behalf of\r\nVenezuela, Mr. Chief Justice Fuller and Mr. Justice Brewer, chosen from our\r\nhighest court, appropriately testify the continuing interest we feel in the\r\ndefinitive adjustment of the question according to the strictest rules of\r\njustice. The British members, Lord Herschell and Sir Richard Collins, are\r\njurists of no less exalted repute, while the fifth member and president of\r\nthe tribunal, M. F. De Martens, has earned a world-wide reputation as an\r\nauthority upon international law.\r\n\r\nThe claim of Felipe Scandella against Venezuela for arbitrary expulsion and\r\ninjury to his business has been adjusted by the revocation of the order of\r\nexpulsion and by the payment of the sum of $16,000.\r\n\r\nI have the satisfaction of being able to state that the Bureau of the\r\nAmerican Republics, created in 1890 as the organ for promoting commercial\r\nintercourse and fraternal relations among the countries of the Western\r\nHemisphere, has become a more efficient instrument of the wise purposes of\r\nits founders, and is receiving the cordial support of the contributing\r\nmembers of the international union which are actually represented in its\r\nboard of management. A commercial directory, in two volumes, containing a\r\nmass of statistical matter descriptive of the industrial and commercial\r\ninterests of the various countries, has been printed in English, Spanish,\r\nPortuguese, and French, and a monthly bulletin published in these four\r\nlanguages and distributed in the Latin-American countries as well as in the\r\nUnited States has proved to be a valuable medium for disseminating\r\ninformation and furthering the varied interests of the international\r\nunion.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year the important work of collecting information of\r\npractical benefit to American industries and trade through the agency of\r\nthe diplomatic and consular officers has been steadily advanced, and in\r\norder to lay such data before the public with the least delay the practice\r\nwas begun in January, 1898, of issuing the commercial reports from day to\r\nday as they are received by the Department of State. It is believed that\r\nfor promptitude as well as fullness of information the service thus\r\nsupplied to our merchants and manufacturers will be found to show sensible\r\nimprovement and to merit the liberal support of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe experiences of the last year bring forcibly home to us a sense of the\r\nburdens and the waste of war. We desire, in common with most civilized\r\nnations, to reduce to the lowest possible point the damage sustained in\r\ntime of war by peaceable trade and commerce. It is true we may suffer in\r\nsuch cases less than other communities, but all nations are damaged more or\r\nless by the state of uneasiness and apprehension into which an outbreak of\r\nhostilities throws the entire commercial world. It should be our object,\r\ntherefore, to minimize, so far as practicable, this inevitable loss and\r\ndisturbance. This purpose can probably best be accomplished by an\r\ninternational agreement to regard all private property at sea as exempt\r\nfrom capture or destruction by the forces of belligerent powers. The United\r\nStates Government has for many years advocated this humane and beneficent\r\nprinciple, and is now in position to recommend it to other powers without\r\nthe imputation of selfish motives. I therefore suggest for your\r\nconsideration that the Executive be authorized to correspond with the\r\ngovernments of the principal maritime powers with a view of incorporating\r\ninto the permanent law of civilized nations the principle of the exemption\r\nof all private property at sea, not contraband of war, from capture or\r\ndestruction by belligerent powers.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury reports that the receipts of the Government\r\nfrom all sources during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1898, including\r\n$64,751,223 received from sale of Pacific railroads, amounted to\r\n$405,321,335, and its expenditures to $443,168,582. There was collected\r\nfrom customs $149,575,062 and from internal revenue $170,900,641. Our\r\ndutiable imports amounted to $324,635,479, a decrease of $58,156,690 over\r\nthe preceding year, and importations free of duty amounted to $291,414,175,\r\na decrease from the preceding year of $90,524,068. Internal-revenue\r\nreceipts exceeded those of the preceding year by $24,212,067.\r\n\r\nThe total tax collected on distilled spirits was $92,546,999; on\r\nmanufactured tobacco, $36,230,522, and on fermented liquors, $39,515,421.\r\nWe exported merchandise during the year amounting to $1,231,482,330, an\r\nincrease of $180,488,774 from the preceding year.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated upon the basis of present revenue laws that the receipts of\r\nthe Government for the year ending June 30, 1899, will be $577,874,647, and\r\nits expenditures $689,874,647, resulting in a deficiency of $112,000,000.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of December, 1898, there was held in the Treasury gold coin\r\namounting to $138,441,547, gold bullion amounting to $138,502,545, silver\r\nbullion amounting to $93,359,250, and other forms of money amounting to\r\n$451,963,981.\r\n\r\nOn the same date the amount of money of all kinds in circulation, or not\r\nincluded in Treasury holdings, was $1,886,879,504, an increase for the year\r\nof $165,794,966. Estimating our population at 75,194,000 at the time\r\nmentioned, the per capita circulation was $25.09. On the same date there\r\nwas in the Treasury gold bullion amounting to $138,502,545.\r\n\r\nThe provisions made for strengthening the resources of the Treasury in\r\nconnection with the war have given increased confidence in the purpose and\r\npower of the Government to maintain the present standard, and have\r\nestablished more firmly than ever the national credit at home and abroad. A\r\nmarked evidence of this is found in the inflow of gold to the Treasury. Its\r\nnet gold holdings on November 1, 1898, were $239,885,162 as compared with\r\n$153,573,147 on November 1, 1897, and an increase of net cash of\r\n$207,756,100, November 1, 1897, to $300,238,275, November 1, 1898. The\r\npresent ratio of net Treasury gold to outstanding Government liabilities,\r\nincluding United States notes, Treasury notes of 1890, silver certificates,\r\ncurrency certificates, standard silver dollars, and fractional silver coin,\r\nNovember 1, 1898, was 25.35 per cent, as compared with 16.96 per cent,\r\nNovember 1, 1897.\r\n\r\nI renew so much of my recommendation of December, 1897, as follows: That\r\nwhen any of the United States notes are presented for redemption in gold\r\nand are redeemed in gold, such notes shall be kept and set apart and only\r\npaid out in exchange for gold. This is an obvious duty. If the holder of\r\nthe United States note prefers the gold and gets it from the Government, he\r\nshould not receive back from the Government a United States note without\r\npaying gold in exchange for it. The reason for this is made all the more\r\napparent when the Government issues an interest-bearing debt to provide\r\ngold for the redemption of United States notes--a non-interest-bearing\r\ndebt. Surely it should not pay them out again except on demand and for\r\ngold. If they are put out in any other way, they may return again, to he\r\nfollowed by another bond issue to redeem them--another interest-bearing\r\ndebt to redeem a non-interest-bearing debt. This recommendation was made in\r\nthe belief that such provisions of law would insure to a greater degree the\r\nsafety of the present standard, and better protect our currency from the\r\ndangers to which it is subjected from a disturbance in the general business\r\nconditions of the country.\r\n\r\nIn my judgment the present condition of the Treasury amply justifies the\r\nimmediate enactment of the legislation recommended one year ago, under\r\nwhich a portion of the gold holdings should be placed in a trust fund from\r\nwhich greenbacks should be redeemed upon presentation, but when once\r\nredeemed should not thereafter be paid out except for gold.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be inferred that other legislation relating to our currency is\r\nnot required; on the contrary, there is an obvious demand for it.\r\n\r\nThe importance of adequate provision which will insure to our future a\r\nmoney standard related as our money standard now is to that of our\r\ncommercial rivals is generally recognized.\r\n\r\nThe companion proposition that our domestic paper currency shall be kept\r\nsafe and yet be so related to the needs of our industries and internal\r\ncommerce as to be adequate and responsive to such needs is a proposition\r\nscarcely less important. The subject, in all its parts, is commended to the\r\nwise consideration of the Congress.\r\n\r\nThe annexation of Hawaii and the changed relations of the United States to\r\nCuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines resulting from the war, compel the\r\nprompt adoption of a maritime policy by the United States. There should be\r\nestablished regular and frequent steamship communication, encouraged by the\r\nUnited States, under the American flag, with the newly acquired islands.\r\nSpain furnished to its colonies, at an annual cost of about $2,000,000,\r\nsteamship lines communicating with a portion of the world's markets, as\r\nwell as with trade centers of the home Government. The United States will\r\nnot undertake to do less. It is our duty to furnish the people of Hawaii\r\nwith facilities, under national control, for their export and import trade.\r\nIt will be conceded that the present situation calls for legislation which\r\nshall be prompt, durable, and liberal.\r\n\r\nThe part which American merchant vessels and their seamen performed in the\r\nwar with Spain demonstrates that this service, furnishing both pickets and\r\nthe second line of defense, is a national necessity, and should be\r\nencouraged in every constitutional way. Details and methods for the\r\naccomplishment of this purpose are discussed in the report of the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury, to which the attention of Congress is respectfully\r\ninvited.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message I recommended that Congress authorize the\r\nappointment of a commission for the purpose of making systematic\r\ninvestigations with reference to the cause and prevention of yellow fever.\r\nThis matter has acquired an increased importance as a result of the\r\nmilitary occupation of the island of Cuba and the commercial intercourse\r\nbetween this island and the United States which we have every reason to\r\nexpect. The sanitary problems connected with our new relations with the\r\nisland of Cuba and the acquisition of Puerto Rico are no less important\r\nthan those relating to finance, commerce, and administration. It is my\r\nearnest desire that these problems may be considered by competent experts\r\nand that everything may be done which the most recent advances in sanitary\r\nscience can offer for the protection of the health of our soldiers in those\r\nislands and of our citizens who are exposed to the dangers of infection\r\nfrom the importation of yellow fever. I therefore renew my recommendation\r\nthat the authority of Congress may be given and a suitable appropriation\r\nmade to provide for a commission of experts to be appointed for the purpose\r\nindicated.\r\n\r\nUnder the act of Congress approved April 26, 1898, authorizing the\r\nPresident in his discretion, \"upon a declaration of war by Congress, or a\r\ndeclaration by Congress that war exists,\" I directed the increase of the\r\nRegular Army to the maximum of 62,000, authorized in said act.\r\n\r\nThere are now in the Regular Army 57,862 officers and men. In said act it\r\nwas provided--\r\n\r\nThat at the end of any war in which the United States may become\r\ninvolved the Army shall be reduced to a peace basis by the transfer\r\nin the same arm of the service or absorption by promotion or honorable\r\ndischarge, under such regulations as the Secretary of War may establish, of\r\nsupernumerary commissioned officers and the honorable discharge or transfer\r\nof supernumerary enlisted men; and nothing contained in this act shall be\r\nconstrued as authorizing the permanent increase of the commissioned or\r\nenlisted force of the Regular Army beyond that now provided by the law in\r\nforce prior to the passage of this act, except as to the increase of\r\ntwenty-five majors provided for in section 1 hereof. The importance of\r\nlegislation for the permanent increase of the Army is therefore manifest,\r\nand the recommendation of the Secretary of War for that purpose has my\r\nunqualified approval. There can be no question that at this time, and\r\nprobably for some time in the future, 100,000 men will be none too many to\r\nmeet the necessities of the situation. At all events, whether that number\r\nshall be required permanently or not, the power should be given to the\r\nPresident to enlist that force if in his discretion it should be necessary;\r\nand the further discretion should be given him to recruit for the Army\r\nwithin the above limit from the inhabitants of the islands with the\r\ngovernment of which we are charged. It is my purpose to muster out the\r\nentire Volunteer Army as soon as the Congress shall provide for the\r\nincrease of the regular establishment. This will be only an act of justice\r\nand will be much appreciated by the brave men who left their homes and\r\nemployments to help the country in its emergency.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message I stated: The Union Pacific Railway, main line,\r\nwas sold under the decree of the United States court for the district of\r\nNebraska on the 1st and 2d of November of this year. The amount due the\r\nGovernment consisted of the principal of the subsidy bonds, $27,236,512,\r\nand the accrued interest thereon, $31,211,711.75, making the total\r\nindebtedness $58,448,223.75. The bid at the sale covered the first-mortgage\r\nlien and the entire mortgage claim of the Government, principal and\r\ninterest. This left the Kansas Pacific case unconcluded. By a decree of the\r\ncourt in that case an upset price for the property was fixed at a sum which\r\nwould yield to the Government only $2,500,000 upon its lien. The sale, at\r\nthe instance of the Government, was postponed first to December 15, 1897,\r\nand later, upon the application of the United States, was postponed to the\r\n16th day of February, 1898.\r\n\r\nHaving satisfied myself that the interests of the Government required that\r\nan effort should be made to obtain a larger sum, I directed the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury, under the act passed March 3, 1887, to pay out of the\r\nTreasury to the persons entitled to receive the same the amounts due upon\r\nall prior mortgages upon the Eastern and Middle divisions of said railroad\r\nout of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, whereupon the\r\nAttorney-General prepared a petition to be presented to the court, offering\r\nto redeem said prior liens in such manner as the court might direct, and\r\npraying that thereupon the United States might be held to be subrogated to\r\nall the rights of said prior lien holders and that a receiver might be\r\nappointed to take possession of the mortgaged premises and maintain and\r\noperate the same until the court or Congress otherwise directed. Thereupon\r\nthe reorganization committee agreed that if said petition was withdrawn and\r\nthe sale allowed to proceed on the 16th of February, 1898, they would bid a\r\nsum at the sale which would realize to the Government the entire principal\r\nof its debt, $6,303,000.\r\n\r\nBelieving that no better price could be obtained and appreciating the\r\ndifficulties under which the Government would labor if it should become the\r\npurchaser of the road at the sale, in the absence of any authority by\r\nCongress to take charge of and operate the road I directed that upon the\r\nguaranty of a minimum bid which should give the Government the principal of\r\nits debt the sale should proceed. By this transaction the Government\r\nsecured an advance of $3,803,000 over and above the sum which the court had\r\nfixed as the upset price, and which the reorganization committee had\r\ndeclared was the maximum which they would pay for the property.\r\n\r\nIt is a gratifying fact that the result of these proceedings against the\r\nUnion Pacific system and the Kansas Pacific line is that the Government has\r\nreceived on account of its subsidy claim the sum of $64,751,223.75, an\r\nincrease of $18,997,163.76 over the sum which the reorganization committee\r\noriginally agreed to bid for the joint property, the Government receiving\r\nits whole claim, principal and interest, on the Union Pacific, and the\r\nprincipal of its debt on the Kansas Pacific Railroad.\r\n\r\nSteps had been taken to foreclose the Government's lien upon the Central\r\nPacific Railroad Company, but before action was commenced Congress passed\r\nan act, approved July 7, 1898, creating a commission consisting of the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, the Attorney-General, and the Secretary of the\r\nInterior, and their successors in office, with full power to settle the\r\nindebtedness to the Government growing out of the issue of bonds in aid of\r\nthe construction of the Central Pacific and Western Pacific bond-aided\r\nrailroads, subject to the approval of the President.\r\n\r\nNo report has yet been made to me by the commission thus created. Whatever\r\naction is had looking to a settlement of the indebtedness in accordance\r\nwith the act referred to will be duly submitted to the Congress.\r\n\r\nI deem it my duty to call to the attention of Congress the condition of the\r\npresent building occupied by the Department of Justice. The business of\r\nthat Department has increased very greatly since it was established in its\r\npresent quarters. The building now occupied by it is neither large enough\r\nnor of suitable arrangement for the proper accommodation of the business of\r\nthe Department. The Supervising Architect has pronounced it unsafe and\r\nunsuited for the use to which it is put. The Attorney-General in his report\r\nstates that the library of the Department is upon the fourth floor, and\r\nthat all the space allotted to it is so crowded with books as to\r\ndangerously overload the structure. The first floor is occupied by the\r\nCourt of Claims. The building is of an old and dilapidated appearance,\r\nunsuited to the dignity which should attach to this important Department.\r\n\r\nA proper regard for the safety, comfort, and convenience of the officers\r\nand employees would justify the expenditure of a liberal sum of money in\r\nthe erection of a new building of commodious proportions and handsome\r\nappearance upon the very advantageous site already secured for that\r\npurpose, including the ground occupied by the present structure and\r\nadjoining vacant lot, comprising in all a frontage of 201 feet on\r\nPennsylvania avenue and a depth of 136 feet.\r\n\r\nIn this connection I may likewise refer to the inadequate accommodations\r\nprovided for the Supreme Court in the Capitol, and suggest the wisdom of\r\nmaking provision for the erection of a separate building for the court and\r\nits officers and library upon available ground near the Capitol.\r\n\r\nThe postal service of the country advances with extraordinary growth.\r\nWithin twenty years both the revenues and the expenditures of the\r\nPost-Office Department have multiplied threefold. In the last ten years\r\nthey have nearly doubled. Our postal business grows much more rapidly than\r\nour population. It now involves an expenditure of $100,000,000 a year,\r\nnumbers 73,000 post-offices, and enrolls 200,000 employees. This remarkable\r\nextension of a service which is an accurate index of the public conditions\r\npresents gratifying evidence of the advancement of education, of the\r\nincrease of communication and business activity, and of the improvement of\r\nmail facilities leading to their constantly augmenting use.\r\n\r\nThe war with Spain laid new and exceptional labors on the Post-Office\r\nDepartment. The mustering of the military and naval forces of the United\r\nStates required special mail arrangements for every camp and every\r\ncampaign. The communication between home and camp was naturally eager and\r\nexpectant. In some of the larger places of rendezvous as many as 50,000\r\nletters a day required handling. This necessity was met by the prompt\r\ndetail and dispatch of experienced men from the established force and by\r\ndirecting all the instrumentalities of the railway mail and post-office\r\nservice, so far as necessary, to this new need. Congress passed an act\r\nempowering the postmaster-General to establish offices or branches at every\r\nmilitary camp or station, and under this authority the postal machinery was\r\nspeedily put into effective operation.\r\n\r\nUnder the same authority, when our forces moved upon Cuba, Puerto Rico, and\r\nthe Philippines they were attended and followed by the postal service.\r\nThough the act of Congress authorized the appointment of postmasters where\r\nnecessary, it was early determined that the public interests would best be\r\nsubserved, not by new designations, but by the detail of experienced men\r\nfamiliar with every branch of the service, and this policy was steadily\r\nfollowed. When the territory which was the theater of conflict came into\r\nour possession, it became necessary to reestablish mail facilities for the\r\nresident population as well as to provide them for our forces of\r\noccupation, and the former requirement was met through the extension and\r\napplication of the latter obligation. I gave the requisite authority, and\r\nthe same general principle was applied to this as to other branches of\r\ncivil administration under military occupation. The details are more\r\nparticularly given in the report of the postmaster-General, and, while the\r\nwork is only just begun, it is pleasing to be able to say that the service\r\nin the territory which has come under our control is already materially\r\nimproved.\r\n\r\nThe following recommendations of the Secretary of the Navy relative to the\r\nincrease of the Navy have my earnest approval:\r\n\r\n1. Three seagoing sheathed and coppered battle ships of about 13,500 tons\r\ntrial displacement, carrying the heaviest armor and most powerful ordnance\r\nfor vessels of their class, and to have the highest practicable speed and\r\ngreat radius of action. Estimated cost, exclusive of armor and armament,\r\n$3,600,000 each.\r\n\r\n2. Three sheathed and coppered armored cruisers of about 12,000 tons trial\r\ndisplacement, carrying the heaviest armor and most powerful ordnance for\r\nvessels of their class, and to have the highest practicable speed and great\r\nradius of action. Estimated cost, exclusive of armor and armament,\r\n$4,000,000 each.\r\n\r\n3. Three sheathed and coppered protected cruisers of about 6,000 tons trial\r\ndisplacement, to have the highest practicable speed and great radius of\r\naction, and to carry the most powerful ordnance suitable for vessels of\r\ntheir class. Estimated cost, exclusive of armor and armament, $2,150,000\r\neach.\r\n\r\n4. Six sheathed and coppered cruisers of about 2,500 tons trial\r\ndisplacement, to have the highest speed compatible with good cruising\r\nqualities, great radius of action, and to carry the most powerful ordnance\r\nsuited to vessels of their class. Estimated cost, exclusive of armament,\r\n$1,141,800 each.\r\n\r\nI join with the Secretary of the Navy in recommending that grades of\r\nadmiral and vice-admiral be temporarily revived, to be filled by officers\r\nwho have specially distinguished themselves in the war with Spain.\r\n\r\nI earnestly urge upon Congress the importance of early legislation\r\nproviding for the taking of the Twelfth Census. This is necessary in view\r\nof the large amount of work which must be performed in the preparation of\r\nthe schedules preparatory to the enumeration of the population.\r\n\r\nThere were on the pension rolls on June 30, 1898, 993,714 names, an\r\nincrease of nearly 18,000 over the number on the rolls on the same day of\r\nthe preceding year. The amount appropriated by the act of December 22,\r\n1896, for the payment of pensions for the fiscal year of 1898 was\r\n$140,000,000. Eight million seventy thousand eight hundred and seventy-two\r\ndollars and forty-six cents was appropriated by the act of March 31, 1898,\r\nto cover deficiencies in army pensions, and repayments in the sum of\r\n$12,020.33, making a total of $148,082,892.79 available for the payment of\r\npensions during the fiscal year 1898. The amount disbursed from that sum\r\nwas $144,651,879.80, leaving a balance of $3,431,012.99 unexpended on the\r\n30th of June, 1898, which was covered into the Treasury. There were 389\r\nnames added to the rolls during the year by special acts passed at the\r\nsecond session of the Fifty-fifth Congress, making a total of 6,486\r\npensioners by Congressional enactments since 1861.\r\n\r\nThe total receipts of the Patent Office during the past year were\r\n$1,253,948.44. The expenditures were $1,081,633.79, leaving a surplus of\r\n$172,314.65.\r\n\r\nThe public lands disposed of by the Government during the year reached\r\n8,453,896.92 acres, an increase of 614,780.26 acres over the previous year.\r\nThe total receipts from public lands during the fiscal year amounted to\r\n$2,277,995.18, an increase of $190,063.90 over the preceding year. The\r\nlands embraced in the eleven forest reservations which were suspended by\r\nthe act of June 4, 1897, again became subject to the operations of the\r\nproclamations of February 22, 1897, creating them, which added an estimated\r\namount of 19,951,360 acres to the area embraced in the reserves previously\r\ncreated. In addition thereto two new reserves were created during the\r\nyear--the Pine Mountain and Zaca Lake Reserve, in California, embracing\r\n1,644,594 acres, and the Prescott Reserve, in Arizona, embracing 10,240\r\nacres--while the Pecos River Reserve, in New Mexico, has been changed and\r\nenlarged to include 120,000 additional acres.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the year thirty forest reservations, not including those of\r\nthe Afognak Forest and the Fish-Culture Reserve, in Alaska, had been\r\ncreated by Executive proclamations under section 24 of the act of March 3,\r\n1891, embracing an estimated area of 40,719,474 acres.\r\n\r\nThe Department of the Interior has inaugurated a forest system, made\r\npossible by the act of July, 1898, for a graded force of officers in\r\ncontrol of the reserves. This system has only been in full operation since\r\nAugust, but good results have already been secured in many sections. The\r\nreports received indicate that the system of patrol has not only prevented\r\ndestructive fires from gaining headway, but has diminished the number of\r\nfires.\r\n\r\nThe special attention of the Congress is called to that part of the report\r\nof the Secretary of the Interior in relation to the Five Civilized Tribes.\r\nIt is noteworthy that the general condition of the Indians shows marked\r\nprogress. But one outbreak of a serious character occurred during the year,\r\nand that among the Chippewa Indians of Minnesota, which happily has been\r\nsuppressed.\r\n\r\nWhile it has not yet been practicable to enforce all the provisions of the\r\nact of June 28, 1898, \"for the protection of the people of the Indian\r\nTerritory, and for other purposes,\" it is having a salutary effect upon the\r\nnations composing the five tribes. The Dawes Commission reports that the\r\nmost gratifying results and greater advance toward the attainment of the\r\nobjects of the Government have been secured in the past year than in any\r\nprevious year. I can not too strongly indorse the recommendation of the\r\ncommission and of the Secretary of the Interior for the necessity of\r\nproviding for the education of the 30,000 white children resident in the\r\nIndian Territory.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Agriculture has been active in the past year. Explorers\r\nhave been sent to many of the countries of the Eastern and Western\r\nhemispheres for seeds and plants that may be useful to the United States,\r\nand with the further view of opening up markets for our surplus products.\r\nThe Forestry Division of the Department is giving special attention to the\r\ntreeless regions of our country and is introducing species specially\r\nadapted to semiarid regions. Forest fires, which seriously interfere with\r\nproduction, especially in irrigated regions, are being studied, that losses\r\nfrom this cause may be avoided. The Department is inquiring into the use\r\nand abuse of water in many States of the West, and collating information\r\nregarding the laws of the States, the decisions of the courts, and the\r\ncustoms of the people in this regard, so that uniformity may be secured.\r\nExperiment stations are becoming more effective every year. The annual\r\nappropriation of $720,000 by Congress is supplemented by $400,000 from the\r\nStates. Nation-wide experiments have been conducted to ascertain the\r\nsuitableness as to soil and climate and States for growing sugar beets. The\r\nnumber of sugar factories has been doubled in the past two years, and the\r\nability of the United States to produce its own sugar from this source has\r\nbeen clearly demonstrated.\r\n\r\nThe Weather Bureau forecast and observation stations have been extended\r\naround the Caribbean Sea, to give early warning of the approach of\r\nhurricanes from the south seas to our fleets and merchant marine.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1900 will occur the centennial anniversary of the founding of\r\nthe city of Washington for the permanent capital of the Government of the\r\nUnited States by authority of an act of Congress approved July 16, 1790. In\r\nMay, 1800, the archives and general offices of the Federal Government were\r\nremoved to this place. On the 17th of November, 1800, the National Congress\r\nmet here for the first time and assumed exclusive control of the Federal\r\ndistrict and city. This interesting event assumes all the more significance\r\nwhen we recall the circumstances attending the choosing of the site, the\r\nnaming of the capital in honor of the Father of his Country, and the\r\ninterest taken by him in the adoption of plans for its future development\r\non a magnificent scale.\r\n\r\nThese original plans have been wrought out with a constant progress and a\r\nsignal success even beyond anything their framers could have foreseen. The\r\npeople of the country are justly proud of the distinctive beauty and\r\ngovernment of the capital and of the rare instruments of science and\r\neducation which here find their natural home.\r\n\r\nA movement lately inaugurated by the citizens to have the anniversary\r\ncelebrated with fitting ceremonies, including, perhaps, the establishment\r\nof a handsome permanent memorial to mark so historical an occasion and to\r\ngive it more than local recognition, has met with general favor on the part\r\nof the public.\r\n\r\nI recommend to the Congress the granting of an appropriation for this\r\npurpose and the appointment of a committee from its respective bodies. It\r\nmight also be advisable to authorize the President to appoint a committee\r\nfrom the country at large, which, acting with the Congressional and\r\nDistrict of Columbia committees, can complete the plans for an appropriate\r\nnational celebration.\r\n\r\nThe alien contract law is shown by experience to need some amendment; a\r\nmeasure providing better protection for seamen is proposed; the rightful\r\napplication of the eight-hour law for the benefit of labor and of the\r\nprinciple of arbitration are suggested for consideration; and I commend\r\nthese subjects to the careful attention of the Congress.\r\n\r\nThe several departmental reports will be laid before you. They give in\r\ngreat detail the conduct of the affairs of the Government during the past\r\nyear and discuss many questions upon which the Congress may feel called\r\nupon to act.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nWilliam McKinley\r\nDecember 5, 1899\r\n\r\nTo the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nAt the threshold of your deliberations you are called to mourn with your\r\ncountrymen the death of Vice-President Hobart, who passed from this life on\r\nthe morning of November 21 last. His great soul now rests in eternal peace.\r\nHis private life was pure and elevated, while his public career was ever\r\ndistinguished by large capacity, stainless integrity, and exalted motives.\r\nHe has been removed from the high office which he honored and dignified,\r\nbut his lofty character, his devotion to duty, his honesty of purpose, and\r\nnoble virtues remain with us as a priceless legacy and example.\r\n\r\nThe Fifty-sixth Congress convenes in its first regular session with the\r\ncountry in a condition of unusual prosperity, of universal good will among\r\nthe people at home, and in relations of peace and friendship with every\r\ngovernment of the world. Our foreign commerce has shown great increase in\r\nvolume and value. The combined imports and exports for the year are the\r\nlargest ever shown by a single year in all our history. Our exports for\r\n1899 alone exceeded by more than a billion dollars our imports and exports\r\ncombined in 1870. The imports per capita are 20 per cent less than in 1870,\r\nwhile the exports per capita are 58 per cent more than in 1870, showing the\r\nenlarged capacity of the United States to satisfy the wants of its own\r\nincreasing population, as well as to contribute to those of the peoples of\r\nother nations.\r\n\r\nExports of agricultural products were $784,776,142. Of manufactured\r\nproducts we exported in value $339,592,146, being larger than any previous\r\nyear. It is a noteworthy fact that the only years in all our history when\r\nthe products of our manufactories sold abroad exceeded those bought abroad\r\nwere 1898 and 1899.\r\n\r\nGovernment receipts from all sources for the fiscal year ended June 30,\r\n1899, including $11,798,314,14, part payment of the Central Pacific\r\nRailroad indebtedness, aggregated $610,982,004.35. Customs receipts were\r\n$206,128,481.75, and those from internal revenue $273,437,161.51.\r\n\r\nFor the fiscal year the expenditures were $700,093,564.02, leaving a\r\ndeficit of $89,111,559.67.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury estimates that the receipts for the current\r\nfiscal year will aggregate $640,958,112, and upon the basis of present\r\nappropriations the expenditures will aggregate $600,958,112, leaving a\r\nsurplus of $40,000,000.\r\n\r\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 1899, the internal-revenue receipts were\r\nincreased about $100,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe present gratifying strength of the Treasury is shown by the fact that\r\non December 1, 1899, the available cash balance was $278,004,837.72, Of\r\nwhich $239,744,905.36 was in gold coin and bullion. The conditions of\r\nconfidence which prevail throughout the country have brought gold into more\r\ngeneral use and customs receipts are now almost entirely paid in that\r\ncoin.\r\n\r\nThe strong position of the Treasury with respect to cash on hand and the\r\nfavorable showing made by the revenues have made it possible for the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury to take action under the provisions of section\r\n3694, Revised Statutes, relating to the sinking fund. Receipts exceeded\r\nexpenditures for the first five months of the current fiscal year by\r\n$13,413,389.91, and, as mentioned above, the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nestimates that there will be a surplus of approximately $40,000,000 at the\r\nend of the year. Under such conditions it was deemed advisable and proper\r\nto resume compliance with the provisions of the sinking-fund law, which for\r\neight years has not been done because of deficiencies in the revenues. The\r\nTreasury Department therefore offered to purchase during November\r\n$25,000,000 of the 5 per cent loan of 1904, or the 4 per cent funded loan\r\nof 1907, at the current market price. The amount offered and purchased\r\nduring November was $18,408,600. The premium paid by the Government on such\r\npurchases was $2,263,521 and the net saving in interest was about\r\n$2,885,000. The success of this operation was sufficient to induce the\r\nGovernment to continue the offer to purchase bonds to and including the 23d\r\nday of December, instant, unless the remainder of the $25,000,000 called\r\nfor should be presented in the meantime for redemption.\r\n\r\nIncreased activity in industry, with its welcome attendant--a larger\r\nemployment for labor at higher wages--gives to the body of the people a\r\nlarger power to absorb the circulating medium. It is further true that year\r\nby year, with larger areas of land under cultivation, the increasing volume\r\nof agricultural products, cotton, corn, and wheat, calls for a larger\r\nvolume of money supply. This is especially noticeable at the\r\ncrop-harvesting and crop-moving period.\r\n\r\nIn its earlier history the National Banking Act seemed to prove a\r\nreasonable avenue through which needful additions to the circulation could\r\nfrom time to time be made. Changing conditions have apparently rendered it\r\nnow inoperative to that end. The high margin in bond securities required,\r\nresulting from large premiums which Government bonds command in the market,\r\nor the tax on note issues, or both operating together, appear to be the\r\ninfluences which impair its public utility.\r\n\r\nThe attention of Congress is respectfully invited to this important matter,\r\nwith the view of ascertaining whether or not such reasonable modifications\r\ncan be made in the National Banking Act as will render its service in the\r\nparticulars here referred to more responsive to the people's needs. I again\r\nurge that national banks be authorized to organize with a capital of\r\n$25,000.\r\n\r\nI urgently recommend that to support the existing gold standard, and to\r\nmaintain \"the parity in value of the coins of the two metals (gold and\r\nsilver) and the equal power of every dollar at all times in the market and\r\nin the payment of debts,\" the Secretary of the Treasury be given additional\r\npower and charged with the duty to sell United States bonds and to employ\r\nsuch other effective means as may be necessary to these ends. The authority\r\nshould include the power to sell bonds on long and short time, as\r\nconditions may require, and should provide for a rate of interest lower\r\nthan that fixed by the act of January 14, 1875. While there is now no\r\ncommercial fright which withdraws gold from the Government, but, on the\r\ncontrary, such widespread confidence that gold seeks the Treasury demanding\r\npaper money in exchange, yet the very situation points to the present as\r\nthe most fitting time to make adequate provision to insure the continuance\r\nof the gold standard and of public confidence in the ability and purpose of\r\nthe Government to meet all its obligations in the money which the civilized\r\nworld recognizes as the best. The financial transactions of the Government\r\nare conducted upon a gold basis. We receive gold when we sell United States\r\nbonds and use gold for their payment. We are maintaining the parity of all\r\nthe money issued or coined by authority of the Government. We are doing\r\nthese things with the means at hand. Happily at the present time we are not\r\ncompelled to resort to loans to supply gold. It has been done in the past,\r\nhowever, and may have to be done in the future. It behooves us, therefore,\r\nto provide at once the best means to meet the emergency when it arises, and\r\nthe best means are those which are the most certain and economical. Those\r\nnow authorized have the virtue neither of directness nor economy. We have\r\nalready eliminated one of the causes of our financial plight and\r\nembarrassment during the years 1893, 1894, 1895, and 1896. Our receipts now\r\nequal our expenditures; deficient revenues no longer create alarm Let us\r\nremove the only remaining cause by conferring the full and necessary power\r\non the Secretary of the Treasury and impose upon him the duty to uphold the\r\npresent gold standard and preserve the coins of the two metals on a parity\r\nwith each other, which is the repeatedly declared policy of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nIn this connection I repeat my former recommendations that a portion of the\r\ngold holdings shall be placed in a trust fund from which greenbacks shall\r\nbe redeemed upon presentation, but when once redeemed shall not thereafter\r\nbe paid out except for gold.\r\n\r\nThe value of an American merchant marine to the extension of our commercial\r\ntrade and the strengthening of our power upon the sea invites the immediate\r\naction of the Congress. Our national development will be one-sided and\r\nunsatisfactory so long as the remarkable growth of our inland industries\r\nremains unaccompanied by progress on the seas. There is no lack of\r\nconstitutional authority for legislation which shall give to the country\r\nmaritime strength commensurate with its industrial achievements and with\r\nits rank among the nations of the earth,\r\n\r\nThe past year has recorded exceptional activity in our shipyards, and the\r\npromises of continual prosperity in shipbuilding are abundant. Advanced\r\nlegislation for the protection of our seamen has been enacted. Our coast\r\ntrade, under regulations wisely framed at the beginning of the Government\r\nand since, shows results for the past fiscal year unequaled in our records\r\nor those of any other power. We shall fail to realize our opportunities,\r\nhowever, if we complacently regard only matters at home and blind ourselves\r\nto the necessity of securing our share in the valuable carrying trade of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nLast year American vessels transported a smaller share of our exports and\r\nimports than during any former year in all our history, and the measure of\r\nour dependence upon foreign shipping was painfully manifested to our\r\npeople. Without any choice of our own, but from necessity, the Departments\r\nof the Government charged with military and naval operations in the East\r\nand West Indies had to obtain from foreign flags merchant vessels essential\r\nfor those operations.\r\n\r\nThe other great nations have not hesitated to adopt the required means to\r\ndevelop their shipping as a factor in national defense and as one of the\r\nsurest and speediest means of obtaining for their producers a share in\r\nforeign markets. Like vigilance and effort on our part cannot fail to\r\nimprove our situation, which is regarded with humiliation at home and with\r\nsurprise abroad. Even the seeming sacrifices, which at the beginning may be\r\ninvolved, will be offset later by more than equivalent gains.\r\n\r\nThe expense is as nothing compared to the advantage to be achieved. The\r\nreestablishment of our merchant marine involves in a large measure our\r\ncontinued industrial progress and the extension of our commercial triumphs.\r\nI am satisfied the judgment of the country favors the policy of aid to our\r\nmerchant marine, which will broaden our commerce and markets and upbuild\r\nour sea-carrying capacity for the products of agriculture and manufacture;\r\nwhich, with the increase of our Navy, mean more work and wages to our\r\ncountrymen, as well as a safeguard to American interests in every part of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nCombinations of capital organized into trusts to control the conditions of\r\ntrade among our citizens, to stifle competition, limit production, and\r\ndetermine the prices of products used and consumed by the people, are\r\njustly provoking public discussion, and should early claim the attention of\r\nthe Congress.\r\n\r\nThe Industrial Commission, created by the act of the Congress of June 18,\r\n1898, has been engaged in extended hearings upon the disputed questions\r\ninvolved in the subject of combinations in restraint of trade and\r\ncompetition. They have not yet completed their investigation of this\r\nsubject, and the conclusions and recommendations at which they may arrive\r\nare undetermined.\r\n\r\nThe subject is one giving rise to many divergent views as to the nature and\r\nvariety or cause and extent of the injuries to the public which may result\r\nfrom large combinations concentrating more or less numerous enterprises and\r\nestablishments, which previously to the formation of the combination were\r\ncarried on separately.\r\n\r\nIt is universally conceded that combinations which engross or control the\r\nmarket of any particular kind of merchandise or commodity necessary to the\r\ngeneral community, by suppressing natural and ordinary competition, whereby\r\nprices are unduly enhanced to the general consumer, are obnoxious not only\r\nto the common law but also to the public welfare. There must be a remedy\r\nfor the evils involved in such organizations. If the present law can be\r\nextended more certainly to control or check these monopolies or trusts, it\r\nshould be done without delay. Whatever power the Congress possesses over\r\nthis most important subject should be promptly ascertained and asserted.\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison in his annual message of December 3, 1889, says: Earnest\r\nattention should be given by Congress to a consideration of the question\r\nhow far the restraint of those combinations of capital commonly called\r\n\"trusts\" is matter of Federal jurisdiction. When organized, as they often\r\nare, to crush out all healthy competition and to monopolize the production\r\nor sale of an article of commerce and general necessity they are dangerous\r\nconspiracies against the public good, and should be made the subject of\r\nprohibitory and even penal legislation. An act to protect trade and\r\ncommerce against unlawful restraints and monopolies was passed by Congress\r\non the 2d of July, 1890. The provisions of this statute are comprehensive\r\nand stringent. It declares every contract or combination, in the form of a\r\ntrust or otherwise, or conspiracy in the restraint of trade or commerce\r\namong the several States or with foreign nations, to be unlawful. It\r\ndenominates as a criminal every person who makes any such contract or\r\nengages in any such combination or conspiracy, and provides a punishment by\r\nfine or imprisonment. It invests the several circuit courts of the United\r\nStates with jurisdiction to prevent and restrain violations of the act, and\r\nmakes it the duty of the several United States district attorneys, under\r\nthe direction of the Attorney General, to institute proceedings in equity\r\nto prevent and restrain such violations. It further confers upon any person\r\nwho shall be injured in his business or property by any other person or\r\ncorporation by reason of anything forbidden or declared to be unlawful by\r\nthe act, the power to sue therefore in any circuit court of the United\r\nStates without respect to the amount in controversy, and to recover\r\nthreefold the damages by him sustained and the costs of the suit, including\r\nreasonable attorney fees. It will be perceived that the act is aimed at\r\nevery kind of combination in the nature of a trust or monopoly in restraint\r\nof interstate or international commerce.\r\n\r\nThe prosecution by the United States of offenses under the act of 1890 has\r\nbeen frequently resorted to in the Federal courts, and notable efforts in\r\nthe restraint of interstate commerce, such as the Trans-Missouri Freight\r\nAssociation and the joint Traffic Association, have been successfully\r\nopposed and suppressed.\r\n\r\nPresident Cleveland in his annual message of December 7, 1896--more than\r\nsix years subsequent to the enactment of this law--after stating the\r\nevils of these trust combinations, says: Though Congress has attempted to\r\ndeal with this matter by legislation, the laws passed for that purpose thus\r\nfar have proved ineffective, not because of any lack of disposition or\r\nattempt to enforce them, but simply because the laws themselves as\r\ninterpreted by the courts do not reach the difficulty. If the\r\ninsufficiencies of existing laws can be remedied by further legislation, it\r\nshould be done. The fact must be recognized, however, that all Federal\r\nlegislation on this subject may fall short of its purpose because of\r\ninherent obstacles, and also because of the complex character of our\r\ngovernmental system, which, while making the Federal authority supreme\r\nwithin its sphere, has carefully limited that sphere by metes and bounds\r\nwhich cannot be transgressed. The decision of our highest court on this\r\nprecise question renders it quite doubtful whether the evils of trusts and\r\nmonopolies may be adequately treated through Federal action, unless they\r\nseek directly and purposely to include in their objects transportation or\r\nintercourse between States or between the United States and foreign\r\ncountries. It does not follow, however, that this is the limit of the\r\nremedy that may be applied. Even though it may be found that Federal\r\nauthority is not broad enough to fully reach the case, there can be no\r\ndoubt of the power of the several States to act effectively in the\r\npremises, and there should be no reason to doubt their willingness to\r\njudiciously exercise such power. The State legislation to which President\r\nCleveland looked for relief from the evils of trusts has failed to\r\naccomplish fully that object. This is probably due to a great extent to the\r\nfact that different States take different views as to the proper way to\r\ndiscriminate between evil and injurious combinations and those associations\r\nwhich are beneficial and necessary to the business prosperity of the\r\ncountry. The great diversity of treatment in different States arising from\r\nthis cause and the intimate relations of all parts of the country to each\r\nother without regarding State lines in the conduct of business have made\r\nthe enforcement of State laws difficult.\r\n\r\nIt is apparent that uniformity of legislation upon this subject in the\r\nseveral States is much to be desired. It is to be hoped that such\r\nuniformity founded in a wise and just discrimination between what is\r\ninjurious and what is useful and necessary in business operations may be\r\nobtained and that means may be found for the Congress within the\r\nlimitations of its constitutional power so to supplement an effective code\r\nof State legislation as to make a complete system of laws throughout the\r\nUnited States adequate to compel a general observance of the salutary rules\r\nto which I have referred.\r\n\r\nThe whole question is so important and far-reaching that I am sure no part\r\nof it will be lightly considered, but every phase of it will have the\r\nstudied deliberation of the Congress, resulting in wise and judicious\r\naction.\r\n\r\nA review of our relations with foreign States is presented with such\r\nrecommendations as are deemed appropriate.\r\n\r\nThe long-pending boundary dispute between the Argentine Republic and Chile\r\nwas settled in March last by the award of an arbitral commission, on which\r\nthe United States minister at Buenos Ayres served as umpire.\r\n\r\nProgress has been made toward the conclusion of a convention of extradition\r\nwith the Argentine Republic. Having been advised and consented to by the\r\nUnited States Senate and ratified by Argentina, it only awaits the\r\nadjustment of some slight changes in the text before exchange.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message I adverted to the claim of the Austro-Hungarian\r\nGovernment for indemnity for the killing of certain Austrian and Hungarian\r\nsubjects by the authorities of the State of Pennsylvania, at Lattimer,\r\nwhile suppressing an unlawful tumult of miners, September 10, 1897. In view\r\nof the verdict of acquittal rendered by the court before which the sheriff\r\nand his deputies were tried for murder, and following the established\r\ndoctrine that the Government may not be held accountable for injuries\r\nsuffered by individuals at the hands of the public authorities while acting\r\nin the line of duty in suppressing disturbance of the public peace, this\r\nGovernment, after due consideration of the claim advanced by the\r\nAustro-Hungarian Government, was constrained to decline liability to\r\nindemnify the sufferers.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to be able to announce that the Belgian Government has\r\nmitigated the restrictions on the importation of cattle from the United\r\nStates, to which I referred in my last annual message.\r\n\r\nHaving been invited by Belgium to participate in a congress, held at\r\nBrussels, to revise the provisions of the general act Of July 2, 1890, for\r\nthe repression of the African slave trade, to which the United States was a\r\nsignatory party, this Government preferred not to be represented by a\r\nplenipotentiary, but reserved the right of accession to the result. Notable\r\nchanges were made, those especially concerning this country being in the\r\nline of the increased restriction of the deleterious trade in spirituous\r\nliquors with the native tribes, which this Government has from the outset\r\nurgently advocated. The amended general act will be laid before the Senate,\r\nwith a view to its advice and consent.\r\n\r\nEarly in the year the peace of Bolivia was disturbed by a successful\r\ninsurrection. The United States minister remained at his post, attending to\r\nthe American interests in that quarter, and using besides his good offices\r\nfor the protection of the interests of British subjects in the absence of\r\ntheir national representative. On the establishment of the new Government,\r\nour minister was directed to enter into relations therewith.\r\n\r\nGeneral Pando was elected President of Bolivia on October 23.\r\n\r\nOur representative has been instructed to use all permissible friendly\r\nendeavors to induce the Government of Bolivia to amend its marriage laws so\r\nas to give legal status to the non-Catholic and civil marriages of aliens\r\nwithin its jurisdiction, and strong hopes are entertained that the Bolivian\r\nlaw in this regard will be brought, as was that of Peru some years ago,\r\ninto harmony with the general practice of modern States.\r\n\r\nA convention of extradition with Brazil, signed May 14, 1897, has been\r\nratified by the Brazilian Legislature.\r\n\r\nDuring the past summer two national ships of the United States have visited\r\nBrazilian ports on a friendly mission and been cordially received. The\r\nvoyage of the Wilmington up the Amazon River gave rise to a passing\r\nmisunderstanding, owing to confusion in obtaining permission to visit the\r\ninterior and make surveys in the general interest of navigation, but the\r\nincident found a ready adjustment in harmony with the close relations of\r\namity which this Government has always sedulously sought to cultivate with\r\nthe commonwealths of the Western Continent.\r\n\r\nThe claim growing out of the seizure of the American-owned newspaper \"The\r\nPanama Star and Herald\" by the authorities of Colombia has been settled,\r\nafter a controversy of several years, by an agreement assessing at $30,000\r\nthe indemnity to be paid by the Colombian Government, in three installments\r\nof $10,000 each.\r\n\r\nThe good will of Colombia toward our country has been testified anew by the\r\ncordial extension of facilities to the Nicaraguan Canal Commission in their\r\napproaching investigation of the Panama Canal and other projected routes\r\nacross the Isthmus of Darien.\r\n\r\nToward the end of October an insurrectionary disturbance developed in the\r\nColombian Republic. This movement has thus far not attained any decisive\r\nresult and is still in progress.\r\n\r\nDiscussion of the questions raised by the action of Denmark in imposing\r\nrestrictions on the importation of American meats has continued without\r\nsubstantial result in our favor.\r\n\r\nThe neighboring island Republic of Santo Domingo has lately been the scene\r\nof revolution, following a long period of tranquility. It began with the\r\nkilling of President Heureaux in July last, and culminated in the\r\nrelinquishment by the succeeding Vice-President of the reins of government\r\nto the insurgents. The first act of the provisional government was the\r\ncalling of a presidential and constituent election. Juan Isidro Jimenez,\r\nhaving been elected President, was inaugurated on the 14th of November.\r\nRelations have been entered into with the newly established Government.\r\n\r\nThe experimental association of Nicaragua, Honduras, and Salvador, tinder\r\nthe title of the Greater Republic of Central America, when apparently on\r\nthe threshold of a complete federal organization by the adoption of a\r\nconstitution and the formation of a national legislature, was disrupted in\r\nthe last days of November, 1898, by the withdrawal of Salvador. Thereupon\r\nNicaragua and Honduras abandoned the joint compact, each resuming its\r\nformer independent sovereignty. This was followed by the reception of\r\nMinister Merry by the Republics of Nicaragua and Salvador, while Minister\r\nHunter in turn presented his credentials to the Government of Honduras,\r\nthus reverting to the old distribution of the diplomatic agencies of the\r\nUnited States in Central America for which our existing statutes provide. A\r\nNicaraguan envoy has been accredited to the United States.\r\n\r\nAn insurrectionary movement, under General Reyes, broke out at Bluefields\r\nin February last, and for a time exercised actual control in the Mosquito\r\nTerritory. The Detroit was promptly sent thither for the protection of\r\nAmerican interests. After a few weeks the Reyes government renounced the\r\nconflict, giving place to the restored supremacy of Nicaragua. During the\r\ninterregnum certain public dues accruing under Nicaraguan law were\r\ncollected from American merchants by the authorities for the time being in\r\neffective administrative control. Upon the titular government regaining\r\npower, a second payment of these dues was demanded. Controversy arose\r\ntouching the validity of the original payment of the debt to the de facto\r\nregent of the territory. An arrangement was effected in April last by the\r\nUnited States minister and the foreign secretary of Nicaragua whereby the\r\namounts of the duplicate payments were deposited with the British consul\r\npending an adjustment of the matter by direct agreement between the\r\nGovernments of the United States and Nicaragua. The controversy is still\r\nunsettled.\r\n\r\nThe contract of the Maritime Canal Company of Nicaragua was declared\r\nforfeited by the Nicaraguan Government on the Tenth of October, on the\r\nground of nonfulfillment within the ten years' term stipulated in the\r\ncontract. The Maritime Canal Company has lodged a protest against this\r\naction, alleging rights in the premises which appear worthy of\r\nconsideration. This Government expects that Nicaragua will afford the\r\nprotestants a full and fair hearing upon the merits of the case.\r\n\r\nThe Nicaragua Canal Commission, which had been engaged upon the work of\r\nexamination and survey for a ship-canal route across Nicaragua, having\r\ncompleted its labors and made its report, was dissolved on May P, and on\r\nJune To a new commission, known as the Isthmian Canal Commission, was\r\norganized under the terms of the act approved March 3, 1899, for the\r\npurpose of examining the American Isthmus with a view to determining the\r\nmost practicable and feasible route for a ship canal across that Isthmus,\r\nwith its probable cost, and other essential details.\r\n\r\nThis Commission, under the presidency of Rear-Admiral John G. Walker, U. S.\r\nN. (retired), entered promptly upon the work intrusted to it, and is now\r\ncarrying on examinations in Nicaragua along the route of the Panama Canal,\r\nand in Darien from the Atlantic, in the neighborhood of the Atrato River,\r\nto the Bay of Panama, on the Pacific side. Good progress has been made, but\r\nunder the law a comprehensive and complete investigation is called for,\r\nwhich will require much labor and considerable time for its accomplishment.\r\nThe work will be prosecuted as expeditiously as possible and a report made\r\nat the earliest practicable date.\r\n\r\nThe great importance of this work cannot be too often or too strongly\r\npressed upon the attention of the Congress. In my message of a year ago I\r\nexpressed my views of the necessity of a canal which would link the two\r\ngreat oceans, to which I again invite your consideration. The reasons then\r\npresented for early action are even stronger now.\r\n\r\nA pleasing incident in the relations of this Government with that of Chile\r\noccurred in the generous assistance given to the war ship Newark when in\r\ndistress in Chilean waters. Not alone in this way has the friendly\r\ndisposition of Chile found expression. That country has acceded to the\r\nconvention for the establishment of the Bureau of the American Republics,\r\nin which organization every independent State of the continent now shares.\r\n\r\nThe exchange of ratifications of a convention for the revival of the United\r\nStates and Chilean Claims Commission and for the adjudication of claims\r\nheretofore presented but not determined during the life of the previous\r\nCommission has been delayed by reason of the necessity for fresh action by\r\nthe Chilean Senate upon the amendments attached to the ratification of the\r\ntreaty by the United States Senate. This formality is soon to be\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nIn view of disturbances in the populous provinces of northern China, where\r\nare many of our citizens, and of the imminence of disorder near the capital\r\nand toward the seaboard, a guard of marines was landed from the Boston and\r\nstationed during last winter in the legation compound at Peking. With the\r\nrestoration of order this protection was withdrawn.\r\n\r\nThe interests of our citizens in that vast Empire have not been neglected\r\nduring the past year. Adequate protection has been secured for our\r\nmissionaries and some injuries to their property have been redressed.\r\n\r\nAmerican capital has sought and found various opportunities of competing to\r\ncarry out the internal improvements which the Imperial Government is wisely\r\nencouraging, and to develop the natural resources of the Empire. Our trade\r\nwith China has continued to grow, and our commercial rights under existing\r\ntreaties have been everywhere maintained during the past year, as they will\r\nbe in the future.\r\n\r\nThe extension of the area open to international foreign settlement at\r\nShanghai and the opening of the ports of Nanking, Tsing-tao (Kiao chao),\r\nand Ta-lien-wan to foreign trade and settlement will doubtless afford\r\nAmerican enterprise additional facilities and new fields, of which it will\r\nnot be slow to take advantage.\r\n\r\nIn my message to Congress of December 5, 1898, I urged that the\r\nrecommendation which had been made to the Speaker of the House of\r\nRepresentatives by the Secretary of the Treasury on the 14th of June, 1898,\r\nfor an appropriation for a commission to study the commercial and\r\nindustrial conditions in the Chinese Empire and report as to the\r\nopportunities for, and obstacles to, the enlargement of markets in China\r\nfor the raw products and manufactures of the United States, should receive\r\nat your hands the consideration which its importance and timeliness\r\nmerited, but the Congress failed to take action.\r\n\r\nI now renew this recommendation, as the importance of the subject has\r\nsteadily grown since it was first submitted to you, and no time should be\r\nlost in studying for ourselves the resources of this great field for\r\nAmerican trade and enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe death of President Faure in February last called forth those sincere\r\nexpressions of sympathy which befit the relations of two Republics as\r\nclosely allied by unbroken historic ties as are the United States and\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nPreparations for the representation of the industries, arts, and products\r\nof the United States at the World's Exposition to be held in Paris next\r\nyear continue on an elaborate and comprehensive scale, thanks to the\r\ngenerous appropriation provided by Congress and to the friendly interest\r\nthe French Government has shown in furthering a typical exhibit of American\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nThere has been allotted to the United States a considerable addition of\r\nspace, which, while placing our country in the first rant among exhibitors,\r\ndoes not suffice to meet the increasingly urgent demands of our\r\nmanufacturers. The efforts of the Commissioner General are ably directed\r\ntoward a strictly representative display of all that most\r\ncharacteristically marks American achievement in the inventive arts, and\r\nmost adequately shows the excellence of our natural productions.\r\n\r\nIn this age of keen rivalry among nations for mastery in commerce, the\r\ndoctrine of evolution and the rule of the survival of the fittest must be\r\nas inexorable in their operation as they are positive in the results they\r\nbring about. The place won in the struggle by an industrial people can only\r\nbe held by unrelaxed endeavor and constant advance in achievement. The\r\npresent extraordinary impetus in every line of American exportation and the\r\nastounding increase in the volume and value of our share in the world's\r\nmarkets may not be attributed to accidental conditions.\r\n\r\nThe reasons are not far to seek. They lie deep in our national character\r\nand find expression year by year in every branch of handicraft, in every\r\nnew device whereby the materials we so abundantly produce are subdued to\r\nthe artisan's will and made to yield the largest, most practical, and most\r\nbeneficial return. The American exhibit at Paris should, and I am confident\r\nwill, be an open volume, whose lessons of skillfully directed endeavor,\r\nunfaltering energy, and consummate performance may be read by all on every\r\npage, thus spreading abroad a clearer knowledge of the worth of our\r\nproductions and the justice of our claim to an important place in the marts\r\nof the world. To accomplish this by judicious selection, by recognition of\r\nparamount merit in whatever walk of trade or manufacture it may appear, and\r\nby orderly classification and attractive installation is the task of our\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\nThe United States Government building is approaching completion, and no\r\neffort will be spared to make it worthy, in beauty of architectural plan\r\nand in completeness of display, to represent our nation. It has been\r\nsuggested that a permanent building of similar or appropriate design be\r\nerected on a convenient site, already given by the municipality, near the\r\nexposition grounds, to serve in commemoration of the part taken by this\r\ncountry in this great enterprise, as an American National Institute, for\r\nour countrymen resorting to Paris for study.\r\n\r\nI am informed by our Commissioner-General that we shall have in the\r\nAmerican sections at Paris over 7,000 exhibitors, from every State ill our\r\ncountry, a number ten times as great as those which were represented at\r\nVienna in 1873, six times as many as those in Paris in 1878, and four times\r\nas many as those who exhibited in Paris in 1889. This statement does not\r\ninclude the exhibits from either Cuba, Puerto Rico, or Hawaii, for which\r\narrangements have been made.\r\n\r\nA number of important international congresses on special topics affecting\r\npublic interests are proposed to be held in Paris next summer in connection\r\nwith the exposition. Effort will be made to have the several technical\r\nbranches of our administration efficiently represented at those\r\nconferences, each in its special line, and to procure the largest possible\r\nconcourse of State representatives, particularly at the Congresses of\r\nPublic Charity and Medicine.\r\n\r\nOur relations with Germany continue to be most cordial. The increasing\r\nintimacy of direct association has been marked during the year by the\r\ngranting permission in April for the landing on our shores of a cable from\r\nBorkum Emden, on the North Sea, by way of the Azores, and also by the\r\nconclusion on September 2 of a Parcels Post Convention with the German\r\nEmpire. In all that promises closer relations of intercourse and commerce\r\nand a better understanding between two races having so many traits in\r\ncommon, Germany can be assured of the most cordial cooperation of this\r\nGovernment and people. We may be rivals in many material paths, but our\r\nrivalry should be generous and open, ever aiming toward the attainment of\r\nlarger results and the mutually beneficial advancement of each in the line\r\nof its especial adaptabilities.\r\n\r\nThe several governments of the Empire seem reluctant to admit the natural\r\nexcellence of our food productions and to accept the evidence we constantly\r\ntender of the care with which their purity is guarded by rigid inspection\r\nfrom the farm, through the slaughterhouse and the packing establishments,\r\nto the port of shipment. Our system of control over exported food staples\r\ninvites examination from any quarter and challenges respect by its\r\nefficient thoroughness.\r\n\r\nIt is to be hoped that in time the two Governments will act in common\r\naccord toward the realization of their common purpose to safeguard the\r\npublic health and to insure the purity and wholesomeness of all food\r\nproducts imported by either country from the other. Were the Congress to\r\nauthorize an invitation to Germany, in connection with the pending\r\nreciprocity negotiations, for the constitution of a joint commission of\r\nscientific experts and practical men of affairs to conduct a searching\r\ninvestigation of food production and exportation in both countries and\r\nreport to their respective legislatures for the adoption of such remedial\r\nmeasures as they might recommend for either, the way might be opened for\r\nthe desirable result indicated.\r\n\r\nEfforts to obtain for American life insurance companies a full hearing as\r\nto their business operations in Prussia have, after several years of\r\npatient representation, happily succeeded, and one of the most important\r\nAmerican companies has been granted a concession to continue business in\r\nthat Kingdom.\r\n\r\nI am also glad to announce that the German insurance companies have been\r\nreadmitted by the superintendent of insurance to do business in the State\r\nof New York.\r\n\r\nSubsequent to the exchange of our peace treaty with Spain, Germany acquired\r\nthe Caroline Islands by purchase, paying therefore $5,000,000. Assurances\r\nhave been received from the German Government that the rights of American\r\nmissionaries and traders there will be considerately observed.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message I referred to the pending negotiations with Great\r\nBritain in respect to the Dominion of Canada. By means of an executive\r\nagreement, a joint High Commission had been created for the purpose of\r\nadjusting all unsettled questions between the United States and Canada,\r\nembracing twelve subjects, among which were the questions of the fur seals,\r\nthe fisheries of the coast and contiguous inland waters, the Alaskan\r\nboundary, the transit of merchandise in bond, the alien labor laws, mining\r\nrights, reciprocity in trade, revision of the agreement respecting naval\r\nvessels in the Great Lakes, a more complete marking of parts of the\r\nboundary, provision for the conveyance of criminals, and for wrecking and\r\nsalvage.\r\n\r\nMuch progress had been made by the Commission toward the adjustment of many\r\nof these questions, when it became apparent that an irreconcilable\r\ndifference of views was entertained respecting the delimitation of the\r\nAlaskan, boundary. In the failure of an agreement as to the meaning of\r\nArticles III and IV of the treaty of 1825 between Russia and Great Britain,\r\nwhich defined the boundary between Alaska and Canada, the American\r\nCommissioners proposed that the subject of the boundary be laid aside, and\r\nthat the remaining questions of difference be proceeded with, some of which\r\nwere so far advanced as to assure the probability of a settlement. This\r\nbeing declined by the British Commissioners, an adjournment was taken until\r\nthe boundary should be adjusted by the two Governments. The subject has\r\nbeen receiving the careful attention which its importance demands, with the\r\nresult that a modus vivendi for provisional demarcations in the region\r\nabout the head of Lynn Canal has, been agreed upon; and it is hoped that\r\nthe negotiations now in progress between the two Governments will end in an\r\nagreement for the establishment and delimitation of a permanent boundary.\r\n\r\nApart from these questions growing out of our relationship with our\r\nnorthern neighbor, the most friendly disposition and ready agreement have\r\nmarked the discussion of numerous matters arising in the vast and intimate\r\nintercourse of the United States with Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThis Government has maintained an attitude of neutrality in the unfortunate\r\ncontest between Great Britain and the Boer States of Africa. We have\r\nremained faithful to the precept of avoiding entangling alliances as to\r\naffairs not of our direct concern. Had circumstances suggested that the\r\nparties to the quarrel would have welcomed any kindly expression of the\r\nhope of the American people that war might be averted, good offices would\r\nhave been gladly tendered. The United States representative at Pretoria was\r\nearly instructed to see that all neutral American interests be respected by\r\nthe combatants. This has been an easy task in view of the positive\r\ndeclarations of both British and Boer authorities that the personal and\r\nproperty rights of our citizens should be observed.\r\n\r\nUpon the withdrawal of the British agent from Pretoria the United States\r\nconsul was authorized, upon the request of the British Government and with\r\nthe assent of the South African and Orange Free State Governments, to\r\nexercise the customary good offices of a neutral for the care of British\r\ninterests. In the discharge of this function, I am happy to say that\r\nabundant opportunity has been afforded to show the impartiality of this\r\nGovernment toward both the combatants.\r\n\r\nFor the fourth time in the present decade, question has arisen with the\r\nGovernment of Italy in regard to the lynching of Italian subjects. The\r\nlatest of these deplorable events occurred at Tallulah, Louisiana, whereby\r\nfive unfortunates of Italian origin were taken from jail and hanged.\r\n\r\nThe authorities of the State and a representative of the Italian Embassy\r\nhaving separately investigated the occurrence, with discrepant results,\r\nparticularly as to the alleged citizenship of the victims, and it not\r\nappearing that the State had been able to discover and punish the violators\r\nof the law, an independent investigation has been set on foot, through the\r\nagency of the Department of State, and is still in progress. The result\r\nwill enable the Executive to treat the question with the Government of\r\nItaly in a spirit of fairness and justice. A satisfactory solution will\r\ndoubtless be reached.\r\n\r\nThe recurrence of these distressing manifestations of blind mob fury\r\ndirected at dependents or natives of a foreign country suggests that the\r\ncontingency has arisen for action by Congress in the direction of\r\nconferring upon the Federal courts jurisdiction in this class of\r\ninternational cases where the ultimate responsibility of the Federal\r\nGovernment may be involved. The suggestion is not new. In his annual\r\nmessage of December 9, 1891, my predecessor, President Harrison, said: It\r\nwould, I believe, be entirely competent for Congress to make offenses\r\nagainst the treaty rights of foreigners domiciled in the United States\r\ncognizable in the Federal courts. This has not, however, been done, and the\r\nFederal officers and courts have no power in such cases to intervene either\r\nfor the protection of a foreign citizen or for the punishment of his\r\nslayers. It seems to me to follow, in this state of the law, that the\r\nofficers of the State charged with police and judicial powers in such cases\r\nmust, in the consideration of international questions growing out of such\r\nincidents, be regarded in such sense as Federal agents as to make this\r\nGovernment answerable for their acts in cases where it would be answerable\r\nif the United States had used its constitutional power to define and punish\r\ncrimes against treaty rights. A bill to provide for the punishment of\r\nviolations of treaty rights of aliens was introduced in the Senate March 1,\r\n1892, and reported favorably March 30. Having doubtless in view the\r\nlanguage of that part of Article III of the treaty of February 26, 1871,\r\nbetween the United States and Italy, which stipulates that \"The citizens\r\nof each of the high contracting parties shall receive, in the States and\r\nTerritories of the other, most constant protection and security for their\r\npersons and property, and shall enjoy in this respect the same rights and\r\nprivileges as are or shall be granted to the natives, on their submitting\r\nthemselves to the conditions imposed upon the natives,\" the bill so\r\nintroduced and reported provided that any act committed in any State or\r\nTerritory of the United States in violation of the rights of a citizen or\r\nsubject of a foreign country secured to such citizen or subject by treaty\r\nbetween the United States and such foreign country and constituting a crime\r\nunder the laws of the State or Territory shall constitute a like crime\r\nagainst the United States and be cognizable in the Federal courts. No\r\naction was taken by Congress in the matter.\r\n\r\nI earnestly recommend that the subject be taken up anew and acted upon\r\nduring the present session. The necessity for some such provision\r\nabundantly appears. Precedent for constituting a Federal jurisdiction in\r\ncriminal cases where aliens are sufferers is rationally deducible from the\r\nexisting statute, which gives to the district and circuit courts of the\r\nUnited States jurisdiction of civil suits brought by aliens where the\r\namount involved exceeds a certain sum. If such jealous solicitude be shown\r\nfor alien rights in cases of merely civil and pecuniary import, how much\r\ngreater should be the public duty to take cognizance of matters affecting\r\nthe lives and the rights of aliens tinder the settled principles of\r\ninternational law no less than under treaty stipulation, in cases of such\r\ntranscendent wrong-doing as mob murder, especially when experience has\r\nshown that local justice is too often helpless to punish the offenders.\r\n\r\nAfter many years of endeavor on the part of this Government to that end the\r\nItalian Government has consented to enter into negotiations for a\r\nnaturalization convention, having for one of its objects the regulation of\r\nthe status of Italians (except those of an age for active military service)\r\nwho, having been naturalized in the United States, may revisit Italy. It is\r\nhoped that with the mutually conciliatory spirit displayed a successful\r\nconclusion will be reached.\r\n\r\nThe treaty of commerce and navigation between the United States and Japan\r\non November 22, 1894, took effect in accordance with the terms of its XIXth\r\nArticle on the 17th of July last, simultaneously with the enforcement of\r\nlike treaties with the other powers, except France, whose convention did\r\nnot go into operation until August 4, the United States being, however,\r\ngranted up to that date all the privileges and rights accorded to French\r\ncitizens under the old French treaty. By this notable conventional reform\r\nJapan's position as a fully independent sovereign power is assured, control\r\nbeing gained of taxation, customs revenues, judicial administration,\r\ncoasting trade, and all other domestic functions of government, and foreign\r\nextra-territorial rights being renounced.\r\n\r\nComprehensive codes of civil and criminal procedure according to western\r\nmethods, public instruction, patents and copyrights, municipal\r\nadministration, including jurisdiction over the former foreign settlements,\r\ncustoms tariffs and procedure, public health, and other administrative\r\nmeasures have been proclaimed. The working of the new system has given rise\r\nto no material complaints on the part of the American citizens or\r\ninterests, a circumstance which attests the ripe consideration with which\r\nthe change has been prepared.\r\n\r\nValuable assistance was rendered by the Japanese authorities to the United\r\nStates transport ship Morgan City while stranded at Kobe. Permission has\r\nbeen granted to land and pasture army horses at Japanese ports of call on\r\nthe way to the Philippine Islands. These kindly evidences of good will are\r\nhighly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese Government has shown a lively interest in the proposition of\r\nthe Pacific Cable Company to add to its projected cable lines to Hawaii,\r\nGuam, and the Philippines a branch connection with the coast of Japan. It\r\nwould be a gratifying consummation were the utility of the contemplated\r\nscheme enhanced by bringing Japan and the United States into direct\r\ntelegraphic relation.\r\n\r\nWithout repeating the observations of my special message of February 10,\r\n1899, concerning the necessity of a cable to Manila. I respectfully invite\r\nattention to it.\r\n\r\nI recommend that, in case the Congress should not take measures to bring\r\nabout this result by direct action of the Government, the Postmaster\r\nGeneral be authorized to invite competitive bids for the establishment of a\r\ncable; the company making the best responsible bid to be awarded the\r\ncontract; the successful company to give ample bonds to insure the\r\ncompletion of the work within a reasonable time.\r\n\r\nThe year has been marked by constant increase in the intimacy of our\r\nrelations with Mexico and in the magnitude of mutually advantageous\r\ninterchanges. This Government has omitted no opportunity to show its strong\r\ndesire to develop and perpetuate the ties of cordiality now so long happily\r\nunbroken.\r\n\r\nFollowing the termination on January 20, 1899, by Mexico of the convention\r\nof extradition of December 11, 1861, a new treaty more in accordance with\r\nthe ascertained needs of both countries was signed February 22, 1899, and\r\nexchanged in the City of Mexico on the 22d of April last. Its operation\r\nthus far has been effective and satisfactory. A recent case has served to\r\ntest the application of its IVth Article, which provides that neither party\r\nshall be bound to deliver up its own citizens, but that the executive\r\nauthority of each shall have the power to deliver them up if in its\r\ndiscretion it be deemed proper to do so.\r\n\r\nThe extradition of Mrs. Mattie Rich, a citizen of the United States,\r\ncharged with homicide committed in Mexico, was after mature consideration\r\ndirected by me in the conviction that the ends of justice would be thereby\r\nsubserved. Similar action, on appropriate occasion, by the Mexican\r\nExecutive will not only tend to accomplish the desire of both Governments\r\nthat grave crimes go not unpunished, but also to repress lawlessness along\r\nthe border of the two countries. The new treaty stipulates that neither\r\nGovernment shall assume jurisdiction in the punishment of crimes committed\r\nexclusively within the territory of the other. This will obviate in future\r\nthe embarrassing controversies which have heretofore arisen through\r\nMexico's assertion of a claim to try and punish an American citizen for an\r\noffense committed within the jurisdiction of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe International Water Boundary Commission, organized by the convention of\r\nMarch 1, 1889, for the adjustment of questions affecting the Rio Grande\r\nfrontier, has not yet completed its labors. A further extension of its term\r\nfor one year, until December 24, 1899, was effected by a convention signed\r\nDecember z, 1898, and exchanged and proclaimed in February last.\r\n\r\nAn invitation extended to the President of Mexico to visit Chicago in\r\nOctober, on the occasion of laying the corner stone of the United States\r\nGovernment building in that city, was cordially accepted by him, with the\r\nnecessary consent of the Mexican Congress, but the illness of a member of\r\nhis family prevented his attendance. The Minister of Foreign Relations,\r\nhowever, came as the personal representative of President Diaz, and in that\r\nhigh character was duly honored.\r\n\r\nClaims growing out of the seizure of American sealing vessels in Bering Sea\r\nhave been under discussion with the Government of Russia for several years,\r\nwith the recent happy result of an agreement to submit them to the decision\r\nof a single arbitrator. By this act Russia affords proof of her adherence\r\nto the beneficent principle of arbitration which her plenipotentiaries\r\nconspicuously favored at The Hague Disarmament Conference when it was\r\nadvocated by the representatives of the United States.\r\n\r\nA suggestion for a permanent exposition of our products and manufactures in\r\nRussia, although not yet fully shaped, has been so cordially welcomed by\r\nthe Imperial Government that it may not inaptly take a fitting place in\r\nwhatever legislation the Congress may adopt looking to enlargement of our\r\ncommercial opportunities abroad.\r\n\r\nImportant events have occurred in the Samoan Islands. The election,\r\naccording to the laws and customs of Samoa, of a successor to the late\r\nKing, Malietoa Laupepa, developed a contest as to the validity of the\r\nresult, which issue, by the terms of the General Act, was to be decided by\r\nthe Chief justice. Upon his rendering a judgment in favor of Malietoa Tanu,\r\nthe rival chief, Mataafa, took up arms. The active intervention of American\r\nand British war ships became imperative to restore order, at the cost of\r\nsanguinary encounters. In this emergency a joint commission of\r\nrepresentatives of the United States, Germany, and Great Britain was sent\r\nto Samoa to investigate the situation and provide a temporary remedy. By\r\nits active efforts a peaceful solution was reached for the time being, the\r\nkingship being abolished and a provisional government established.\r\nRecommendations unanimously made by the commission for a permanent\r\nadjustment of the Samoan question were taken under consideration by the\r\nthree powers parties to the General Act. But the more they were examined\r\nthe more evident it became that a radical change was necessary in the\r\nrelations of the powers to Samoa.\r\n\r\nThe inconveniences and possible perils of the tripartite scheme of\r\nsupervision and control in the Samoan group by powers having little\r\ninterest in common in that quarter beyond commercial rivalry had been once\r\nmore emphasized by the recent events. The suggested remedy of the joint\r\nCommission, like the scheme it aimed to replace amounted to what has been\r\nstyled a tridominium, being the exercise of the functions of sovereignty by\r\nan unanimous agreement of three powers. The situation had become far more\r\nintricate and embarrassing from every point of view than it was when my\r\npredecessor, in 1894, summed up its perplexities and condemned the\r\nparticipation in it of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement under which Samoa was administered had proved impracticable\r\nand unacceptable to all the powers concerned. To withdraw from the\r\nagreement and abandon the islands to Germany and Great Britain would not be\r\ncompatible with our interests in the archipelago. To relinquish our rights\r\nin the harbor of Pago Pago, the best anchorage in the Pacific, the\r\noccupancy of which had been leased to the United States in 1878 by the\r\nfirst foreign treaty ever concluded by Samoa, was not to be thought of\r\neither as regards the needs of our Navy or the interests of our growing\r\ncommerce with the East. We could not have considered any proposition for\r\nthe abrogation of the tripartite control which did not confirm us in all\r\nour rights and safeguard all our national interests in the islands.\r\n\r\nOur views commended themselves to the other powers. A satisfactory\r\narrangement was concluded between the Governments of Germany and of\r\nEngland, by virtue of which England retired from Samoa in view of\r\ncompensations in other directions, and both powers renounced in favor of\r\nthe United States all their rights and claims over and in respect to that\r\nportion of the group lying to the east of the one hundred and seventy-first\r\ndegree of west longitude, embracing the islands of Tutuila, Ofoo, Olosenga,\r\nand Manua. I transmit to the Senate, for its constitutional action thereon,\r\na convention, which besides the provisions above mentioned also guarantees\r\nus the same privileges and conditions in respect to commerce and commercial\r\nvessels in all of the islands of Samoa as those possessed by Germany.\r\n\r\nClaims have been preferred by white residents of Samoa on account of\r\ninjuries alleged to have been suffered through the acts of the treaty\r\nGovernments in putting down the late disturbances. A convention has been\r\nmade between the three powers for the investigation and settlement of these\r\nclaims by a neutral arbitrator, to which the attention of the Senate will\r\nbe invited.\r\n\r\nMy annual message of last year was necessarily devoted, in great part to a\r\nconsideration of the Spanish War and of the results it wrought and the\r\nconditions it imposed for the future. I am gratified to announce that the\r\ntreaty of peace has restored friendly relations between the two powers.\r\nEffect has been given to its most important provisions. The evacuation of\r\nPuerto Rico having already been accomplished on the XIVth of October, 1898,\r\nnothing remained necessary there but to continue the provisional military\r\ncontrol of the island until the Congress should enact a suitable government\r\nfor the ceded territory. Of the character and scope of the measures to that\r\nend I shall treat in another part of this message.\r\n\r\nThe withdrawal of the authority of Spain from the island of Cuba was\r\neffected by the 1st of January, so that the full re-establishment of peace\r\nfound the relinquished territory held by us in trust for the inhabitants,\r\nmaintaining, under the direction of the Executive, such government and\r\ncontrol therein as should conserve public order, restore the productive\r\nconditions of peace so long disturbed by the instability and disorder which\r\nprevailed for the greater part of the preceding three decades, and build up\r\nthat tranquil development of the domestic state whereby alone can be\r\nrealized the high purpose, as proclaimed in the joint resolution adopted by\r\nthe Congress on the 19th of April, 1898, by which the United States\r\ndisclaimed any disposition or intention to exercise sovereignty,\r\njurisdiction, or control over Cuba, except for the pacification thereof,\r\nand asserted its determination when that was accomplished to leave the\r\ngovernment and control of the island to its people. The pledge contained in\r\nthis resolution is of the highest honorable obligation and must be sacredly\r\nkept.\r\n\r\nI believe that substantial progress has been made in this direction. All\r\nthe administrative measures adopted in Cuba have aimed to fit it for a\r\nregenerated existence by enforcing the supremacy of law and justice; by\r\nplacing wherever practicable the machinery of administration in the hands\r\nof the inhabitants; by instituting needed sanitary reforms; by spreading\r\neducation; by fostering industry and trade; by inculcating public morality,\r\nand, in short, by taking every rational step to aid the Cuban people to\r\nattain to that plane of self-conscious respect and self-reliant unity which\r\nfits an enlightened community for self-government within its own sphere,\r\nwhile enabling it to fulfill all outward obligation.\r\n\r\nThis nation has assumed before the world a grave responsibility for the\r\nfuture good government of Cuba. We have accepted a trust the fulfillment of\r\nwhich calls for the sternest integrity of purpose and the exercise of the\r\nhighest wisdom. The new Cuba yet to arise from the ashes of the past must\r\nneeds be bound to us by ties of singular intimacy and strength if its\r\nenduring welfare is to be assured. Whether those ties shall be organic or\r\nconventional, the destinies of Cuba are in some rightful form and manner\r\nirrevocably linked with our own, but how and how far is for the future to\r\ndetermine in the ripeness of events. Whatever be the outcome, we must see\r\nto it that free Cuba be a reality, not a name, a perfect entity, not a\r\nhasty experiment bearing within itself the elements of failure. Our\r\nmission, to accomplish which we took up the wager of battle, is not to be\r\nfulfilled by turning adrift any loosely framed commonwealth to face the\r\nvicissitudes which too often attend weaker States whose natural wealth and\r\nabundant resources are offset by the incongruities of their political\r\norganization and the recurring occasions for internal rivalries to sap\r\ntheir strength and dissipate their energies. The greatest blessing which\r\ncan come to Cuba is the restoration of her agricultural and industrial\r\nprosperity, which will give employment to idle men and re-establish the\r\npursuits of peace. This is her chief and immediate need.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of August last an order was made for the taking of the census\r\nin the island, to be completed on the 30th of November. By the treaty of\r\npeace the Spanish people on the island have until April 11, 1900, to elect\r\nwhether they will remain citizens of Spain or become citizens of Cuba.\r\nUntil then it cannot be definitely ascertained who shall be entitled to\r\nparticipate in the formation of the government of Cuba. By that time the\r\nresults of the census will have been tabulated and we shall proceed to\r\nprovide for elections which will commit the municipal governments of the\r\nisland to the officers elected by the people. The experience thus acquired\r\nwill prove of great value in the formation of a representative convention\r\nof the people to draft a constitution and establish a general system of\r\nindependent government for the island. In the meantime and so long as we\r\nexercise control over the island the products of Cuba should have a market\r\nin the United States on as good terms and with as favorable rates of duty\r\nas are given to the West India Islands under treaties of reciprocity which\r\nshall be made.\r\n\r\nFor the relief of the distressed in the island of Cuba the War Department\r\nhas issued supplies to destitute persons through the officers of the Army,\r\nwhich have amounted to 5,493,000 rations, at a cost Of $1,417,554.07.\r\n\r\nTo promote the disarmament of the Cuban volunteer army, and in the interest\r\nof public peace and the welfare of the people, the sum Of $75 was paid to\r\neach Cuban soldier borne upon the authenticated rolls, on condition that he\r\nshould deposit his arms with the authorities designated by the United\r\nStates. The sum thus disbursed aggregated $2,547,750, which was paid from\r\nthe emergency fund provided by the act of January 5, 1899, for that\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nOut of the Cuban island revenues during the six months ending June 30,\r\n1899, $1,712,014.20 was expended for sanitation, $293,881.70 for charities\r\nand hospitals, and $88,944.03 for aid to the destitute.\r\n\r\nFollowing the exchange of ratifications of the treaty of peace the two\r\nGovernments accredited ministers to each other, Spain sending to Washington\r\nthe Duke of Arcos, an eminent diplomatist, previously stationed in Mexico,\r\nwhile the United States transferred to Madrid Hon. Bellamy Storer, its\r\nminister at Brussels. This was followed by the respective appointment of\r\nconsuls, thereby fully resuming the relations interrupted by the war. In\r\naddition to its consular representation in the United States, the Spanish\r\nGovernment has appointed consuls for Cuba, who have been provisionally\r\nrecognized during the military administration of the affairs of that\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nJudicial intercourse between the courts of Cuba and Puerto Rico and of\r\nSpain has been established, as provided by the treaty of peace. The Cuban\r\npolitical prisoners in Spanish penal stations have been and are being\r\nreleased and returned to their homes, in accordance with Article VI of the\r\ntreaty. Negotiations are about to be had for defining the conventional\r\nrelations between the two countries, which fell into abeyance by reason of\r\nthe war. I trust that these will include a favorable arrangement for\r\ncommercial reciprocity under the terms of sections 3 and 4 of the current\r\ntariff act. In these, as in all matters of international concern, no effort\r\nwill be spared to respond to the good disposition of Spain, and to\r\ncultivate in all practicable ways the intimacy which should prevail between\r\ntwo nations whose past history has so often and in so many ways been marked\r\nby sincere friendship and by community of interests.\r\n\r\nI would recommend appropriate legislation in order to carry into execution\r\nArticle VII of the Treaty of Peace with Spain, by which the United States\r\nassured the payment of certain claims for indemnity of its citizens against\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\nThe United States minister to Turkey continues, under instructions, to\r\npress for a money payment in satisfaction of the just claims for injuries\r\nsuffered by American citizens in the disorders of several years past and\r\nfor wrongs done to them by the Ottoman authorities. Some of these claims\r\nare of many years' standing. This Government is hopeful of a general\r\nagreement in this regard.\r\n\r\nIn the Turkish Empire the situation of our citizens remains unsatisfactory.\r\nOur efforts during nearly forty years to bring about a convention of\r\nnaturalization seem to be on the brink of final failure through the\r\nannounced policy of the Ottoman Porte to refuse recognition of the alien\r\nstatus of native Turkish subjects naturalized abroad since 1867. Our\r\nstatutes do not allow this Government to admit any distinction between the\r\ntreatment of native and naturalized Americans abroad, so that ceaseless\r\ncontroversy arises in cases where persons owing in the eye of international\r\nlaw a dual allegiance are prevented from entering Turkey or are expelled\r\nafter entrance. Our law in this regard contrasts with that of the European\r\nStates. The British act, for instance, does not claim effect for the\r\nnaturalization of an alien in the event of his return to his native\r\ncountry, unless the change be recognized by the law of that country or\r\nstipulated by treaty between it and the naturalizing State.\r\n\r\nThe arbitrary treatment, in some instances, of American productions in\r\nTurkey has attracted attention of late, notably in regard to our flour.\r\nLarge shipments by the recently opened direct steamship line to Turkish\r\nports have been denied entrance on the score that, although of standard\r\ncomposition and unquestioned purity, the flour was pernicious to health\r\nbecause of deficient \"elasticity\" as indicated by antiquated and\r\nuntrustworthy tests. Upon due protest by the American minister, and it\r\nappearing that the act was a virtual discrimination against our product,\r\nthe shipments in question were admitted. In these, as in all instances,\r\nwherever occurring, when American products may be subjected in a foreign\r\ncountry, upon specious pretexts, to discrimination compared with the like\r\nproducts of another country, this Government will use its earnest efforts\r\nto secure fair and equal treatment for its citizens and their goods.\r\nFailing this, it will not hesitate to apply whatever corrective may be\r\nprovided by the statutes.\r\n\r\nThe International Commission of Arbitration, appointed under the\r\nAnglo-Venezuelan treaty of 1897, rendered an award on October 3 last,\r\nwhereby the boundary line between Venezuela and British Guiana is\r\ndetermined, thus ending a controversy which has existed for the greater\r\npart of the century. The award, as to which the arbitrators were unanimous,\r\nwhile not meeting the extreme contention of either party, gives to Great\r\nBritain a large share of the interior territory in dispute and to Venezuela\r\nthe entire mouth of the Orinoco, including Barima Point and the Caribbean\r\nlittoral for some distance to the eastward. The decision appears to be\r\nequally satisfactory to both parties.\r\n\r\nVenezuela has once more undergone a revolution. The insurgents, under\r\nGeneral Castro, after a sanguinary engagement in which they suffered much\r\nloss, rallied in the mountainous interior and advanced toward the capital.\r\nThe bulk of the army having sided with the movement, President Andrade\r\nquitted Caracas, where General Castro set up a provisional government with\r\nwhich our minister and the representatives of other powers entered into\r\ndiplomatic relations on the 20th of November, 1899.\r\n\r\nThe fourth section of the Tariff Act approved July 24, 1897, appears to\r\nprovide only for commercial treaties which should be entered into by the\r\nPresident and also ratified by the Senate within two years from its\r\npassage. Owing to delays inevitable in negotiations of this nature, none of\r\nthe treaties initiated under that section could be concluded in time for\r\nratification by the Senate prior to its adjournment on the 4th of March\r\nlast. Some of the pending negotiations, however, were near conclusion at\r\nthat time, and the resulting conventions have since been signed by the\r\nplenipotentiaries. Others, within both the third and fourth sections of the\r\nact, are still under consideration. Acting under the constitutional power\r\nof the Executive in respect to treaties, I have deemed it my duty, while\r\nobserving the limitations of concession provided by the fourth section, to\r\nbring to a conclusion all pending negotiations, and submit them to the\r\nSenate for its advice and consent.\r\n\r\nConventions of reciprocity have been signed during the Congressional recess\r\nwith Great Britain for the respective colonies of British Guiana, Barbados,\r\nBermuda, Jamaica, and Turks and Caicos Islands, and with the Republic of\r\nNicaragua.\r\n\r\nImportant reciprocal conventions have also been concluded with France and\r\nwith the Argentine Republic.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message the progress noted in the work of the diplomatic\r\nand consular officers in collecting information as to the industries and\r\ncommerce of other countries, and in the care and promptitude with which\r\ntheir reports are printed and distributed, has continued during the past\r\nyear, with increasingly valuable results in suggesting new sources of\r\ndemand for American products and in pointing out the obstacles still to be\r\novercome in facilitating the remarkable expansion of our foreign trade. It\r\nwill doubtless be gratifying to Congress to learn that the various agencies\r\nof the Department of State are co-operating in these endeavors with a zeal\r\nand effectiveness which are not only receiving the cordial recognition of\r\nour business interests, but are exciting the emulation of other\r\nGovernments. In any rearrangement of the great and complicated work of\r\nobtaining official data of an economic character which Congress may\r\nundertake it is most important, in my judgment, that the results already\r\nsecured by the efforts of the Department of State should be carefully\r\nconsidered with a view to a judicious development and increased utility to\r\nour export trade.\r\n\r\nThe interest taken by the various States forming the International Union of\r\nAmerican Republics in the work of its organic bureau is evidenced by the\r\nfact that for the first time since its creation in 1890 all the Republics\r\nof South and Central America are now represented in it.\r\n\r\nThe unanimous recommendation of the International American Conference,\r\nproviding for the International Union of American Republics, stated that it\r\nshould continue in force during a term of ten years from the date of its\r\norganization, and no country becoming a member of the union should cease to\r\nbe a member until the end of said period of ten years, and unless twelve\r\nmonths before the expiration of said period a majority of the members of\r\nthe union had given to the Secretary of State of the United States official\r\nnotice of their wish to terminate the union at the end of its first period,\r\nthat the union should continue to be maintained for another period of ten\r\nyears, and thereafter, under the same conditions, for successive periods of\r\nten years each.\r\n\r\nThe period for notification expired on July 14, 1899, without any of the\r\nmembers having given the necessary notice of withdrawal. Its maintenance is\r\ntherefore assured for the next ten years. In view of this fact and of the\r\nnumerous questions of general interest and common benefit to all of the\r\nRepublics of America, some of which were considered by the first\r\nInternational American Conference, but not finally settled, and others\r\nwhich have since then grown to importance, it would seem expedient that the\r\nvarious Republics constituting the Union should be invited to hold at an\r\nearly date another conference in the capital of one of the countries other\r\nthan the United States, which has already enjoyed this honor.\r\n\r\nThe purely international character of the work being done by the bureau and\r\nthe appreciation of its value are further emphasized by the active\r\nco-operation which the various Governments of the Latin. American Republics\r\nand their diplomatic representatives in this capital are now exhibiting and\r\nthe zealous endeavors they are making to extend its field of usefulness, to\r\npromote through it commercial intercourse, and strengthen the bonds of\r\namity and confidence between its various members and the nations of this\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nThe act to encourage the holding of the Pan-American Exposition on the\r\nNiagara frontier, within the county of Erie or Niagara, in the State of New\r\nYork, in the year 1901, was approved on March 3, 1899.\r\n\r\nThis exposition, which will be held in the city of Buffalo, in the near\r\nvicinity of the great Niagara cataract, and within a day's journey of which\r\nreside 40, 000, 000 Of our people, will be confined entirely to the Western\r\nHemisphere. Satisfactory assurances have already been given by the\r\ndiplomatic representatives of Great Britain, Mexico, the Central and South\r\nAmerican Republics, and most of the States of the United States that these\r\ncountries and States will make an unique, interesting, and instructive\r\nexhibit, peculiarly illustrative of their material progress during the\r\ncentury which is about to close.\r\n\r\nThe law provides an appropriation Of $500,000 for the purpose of making an\r\nexhibit at the exposition by the Government of the United States from its\r\nExecutive Departments and from the Smithsonian Institution and National\r\nMuseum, the United States Commission of Fish and Fisheries, the Department\r\nof Labor, and the Bureau of the American Republics. To secure a complete\r\nand harmonious arrangement of this Government exhibit a board of management\r\nhas already been created, and charged with the selection, purchase,\r\npreparation, transportation, arrangement, and safe-keeping of the articles\r\nand materials to be exhibited. This board has been organized and has\r\nalready entered upon the performance of its duties, as provided for by the\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nI have every reason to hope and believe that this exposition will tend more\r\nfirmly to cement the cordial relations between the nations on this\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with an act of Congress approved December 21, 1898, and under\r\nthe auspices of the Philadelphia Commercial Museum, a most interesting and\r\nvaluable exposition of products and manufactures especially adapted to\r\nexport trade was held in Philadelphia from the 14th of September to the 1st\r\nof December, 1899. The representative character of the exhibits and the\r\nwidespread interest manifested in the special objects of the undertaking\r\nafford renewed encouragement to those who look confidently to the steady\r\ngrowth of our enlarged exportation of manufactured goods, which has been\r\nthe most remarkable fact in the economic development of the United States\r\nin recent years. A feature of this exposition which is likely to become of\r\npermanent and increasing utility to our industries is the collection of\r\nsamples of merchandise produced in various countries with special reference\r\nto particular markets, providing practical object lessons to United States\r\nmanufacturers as to qualities, styles, and prices of goods such as meet the\r\nspecial demands of consumers and may be exported with advantage.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the exposition an International Commercial Congress was\r\nheld, upon the invitation of the Philadelphia Commercial Museum,\r\ntransmitted by the Department of State to the various foreign Governments,\r\nfor an exchange of information and opinions with the view to the promotion\r\nof international trade. This invitation met with general and cordial\r\nacceptance, and the Congress, which began its sessions at the exposition on\r\nthe 13th of October proved to be of great practical importance, from the\r\nfact that it developed a general recognition of the interdependence of\r\nnations in trade and a most gratifying spirit of accommodation with\r\nreference to the gradual removal of existing impediments to reciprocal\r\nrelations, without injury to the industrial interests of either party.\r\n\r\nIn response to the invitation of His Majesty, the Emperor of Russia,\r\ndelegates from twenty-six countries were assembled at The Hague on the 18th\r\nof May, as members of a conference in the interest of peace. The commission\r\nfrom the United States consisted of the Hon. Andrew D. White, the Hon. Seth\r\nLow, the Hon. Stanford Newel, Captain Alfred T. Mahan, of the United States\r\nNavy, Captain William Crozier, of the United States Army, and the Hon.\r\nFrederick W. Holls, secretary. The occasion seemed to be opportune for the\r\nserious consideration of a plan for the pacific adjustment of international\r\ndifferences, a subject in which the American people have been deeply\r\ninterested for many years, and a definite project for a permanent\r\ninternational tribunal was included in the instructions to the delegates of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nThe final act of the conference includes conventions upon the amelioration\r\nof the laws and customs of war on land, the adaptation to maritime warfare\r\nof the principles of the Geneva Convention of 1864, and the extension of\r\njudicial methods to international cases. The Convention for the Pacific\r\nSettlement of International Conflicts embodies the leading features of the\r\nAmerican plan, with such modifications as were rendered necessary by the\r\ngreat diversity of views and interests represented by the delegates. The\r\nfour titles of the convention provide for the maintenance of general peace,\r\nthe exercise of good offices and mediation, the formation of commissions of\r\ninquiry, and international arbitration.\r\n\r\nThe mediation provided for by the convention is purely voluntary and\r\nadvisory, and is intended to avoid any invasion or limitation of the\r\nsovereign rights of the adhering States. The commissions of inquiry\r\nproposed consists of delegations to be specifically constituted for\r\nparticular purposes by means of conventions between the contesting parties,\r\nhaving for their object the clear understanding of international\r\ndifferences before resorting to the use of force. The provision for\r\narbitration contemplates the formation of a permanent tribunal before which\r\ndisputed cases may be brought for settlement by the mutual consent of the\r\nlitigants in each separate case. The advantages of such a permanent\r\ntribunal over impromptu commissions of arbitration are conceived to be the\r\nactual existence of a competent court, prepared to administer justice, the\r\ngreater economy resulting from a well-devised system, and the accumulated\r\njudicial skill and experience which such a tribunal would soon possess.\r\n\r\nWhile earnestly promoting the idea of establishing a permanent\r\ninternational tribunal, the delegation of the United States was not\r\nunmindful of the inconveniences which might arise from an obtrusive\r\nexercise of mediation, and in signing the convention carefully guarded the\r\nhistoric position of the United States by the following declaration:\r\nNothing contained in this convention shall be so construed as to require\r\nthe United States of America to depart from its traditional policy of not\r\nintruding upon, interfering with, or entangling itself in the political\r\nquestions or policy or internal administration of any foreign state; nor\r\nshall anything contained in the said convention be construed to imply a\r\nrelinquishment by the United. States of America of its traditional attitude\r\ntoward purely American questions. Thus interpreted, the Convention for the\r\nPacific Settlement of International Conflicts may be regarded as realizing\r\nthe earnest desire of great numbers of American citizens, whose deep sense\r\nof justice, expressed in numerous resolutions and memorials, has urged them\r\nto labor for this noble achievement. The general character of this\r\nconvention, already signed by the delegates of more than twenty sovereign\r\nStates, further commends it to the favorable action of the Senate of the\r\nUnited States, whose ratification it still awaits.\r\n\r\nSince my last annual message, and in obedience to the acts of the Congress\r\nof April 22 and 26, 1898, the remaining volunteer force enlisted for the\r\nSpanish War, consisting Of 34,834 regulars and 110,202 volunteers, with\r\nover 5,000 volunteer officers, has been discharged from the military\r\nservice. Of the volunteers, 667 officers and 14,831 men were serving in the\r\nPhilippines, and 1,650 of the regulars, who were entitled to be mustered\r\nout after the ratification of the treaty of peace. They voluntarily\r\nremained at the front until their places could be filled by new troops.\r\nThey were returned home in the order in which they went to Manila, and are\r\nnow all of them out of the service and in the ranks of citizenship. I\r\nrecommend that the Congress provide a special medal of honor for the\r\nvolunteers, regulars, sailors, and marines on duty in the Philippines who\r\nvoluntarily remained in the service after their terms of enlistment had\r\nexpired.\r\n\r\nBy the act of March 2, 1899, Congress gave authority to increase the\r\nRegular Army to a maximum not exceeding 65,000 enlisted men, and to enlist\r\na force of 5,000 volunteers, to be recruited from the country at large. By\r\nvirtue of this authority the Regular Army has been increased to the number\r\nof 61,999 enlisted men and 2,248 officers, and new volunteer regiments have\r\nbeen organized aggregating 33,050 enlisted men and 1,524 officers. Two of\r\nthese volunteer regiments are made up of colored men, with colored line\r\nofficers. The new troops to take the places of those returning from the\r\nPhilippines have been transported to Manila to the number of 581 officers\r\nand 26,322 enlisted men of the Regular Army and 594 officers and 15,388\r\nenlisted men of the new volunteer force, while 504 officers and 14, 119 men\r\nof the volunteer force are on the ocean en route to Manila.\r\n\r\nThe force now in Manila consists Of 905 officers and 30,578 regulars, and\r\n594 officers and 15,388 of the volunteers, making an aggregate of 1,499\r\nofficers and 45,966 men. When the troops now under orders shall reach\r\nManila the force in the archipelago will comprise 2,051 officers and 63,483\r\nmen. The muster out of the great volunteer army organized for the Spanish\r\nWar and the creation of a new army, the transportation from Manila to San\r\nFrancisco of those entitled to discharge and the transportation of the new\r\ntroops to take their places have been a work of great magnitude well and\r\nably done, for which too much credit cannot be given the War Department.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year we have reduced our force in Cuba and Puerto Rico, In\r\nCuba we now have 334 officers and 10,796 enlisted men; In Puerto Rico, 87\r\nofficers and 2,855 enlisted men and a battalion of 400 men composed of\r\nnative Puerto Ricans; while stationed throughout the United States are 910\r\nofficers and 17,317 men, and in Hawaii 12 officers and 453 enlisted men.\r\n\r\nThe operations of the Army are fully presented in the report of the\r\nSecretary of War. I cannot withhold from officers and men the highest\r\ncommendation for their soldierly conduct in trying situations, their\r\nwilling sacrifices for their country, and the integrity and ability with\r\nwhich they have performed unusual and difficult duties in our island\r\npossessions.\r\n\r\nIn the organization of the volunteer regiments authorized by the act of\r\nMarch 2, 1899, it was found that no provision had been made for chaplains.\r\nThis omission was doubtless from inadvertence. I recommend the early\r\nauthorization for the appointment of one chaplain for each of said\r\nregiments. These regiments are now in the Philippines, and it is important\r\nthat immediate action be had.\r\n\r\nIn restoring peaceful conditions, orderly rule, and civic progress in Cuba,\r\nPuerto Rico, and, so far as practicable, in the Philippines, the\r\nrehabilitation of the postal service has been an essential and important\r\npart of the work. It became necessary to provide mail facilities both for\r\nour forces of occupation and for the native population. To meet this\r\nrequirement has involved a substantial reconstruction. The existing systems\r\nwere so fragmentary, defective, and inadequate that a new and comprehensive\r\norganization had to be created. American trained officials have been\r\nassigned to the directing and executive positions, while natives have been\r\nchiefly employed in making up the body of the force. In working out this\r\nplan the merit rule has been rigorously and faithfully applied.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of Director-General of Posts of Cuba was given to an expert\r\nwho had been Chief Post-Office Inspector and Assistant Postmaster-General,\r\nand who united large experience with administrative capacity. For the\r\npostmastership at Havana the range of skilled and available men was\r\nscanned, and the choice fell upon one who had been twenty years in the\r\nservice as deputy postmaster and postmaster of a large city. This principle\r\ngoverned and determined the selection of the American officials sent not\r\nonly to Cuba, but to Puerto Rico and the Philippines, and they were\r\ninstructed to apply it so far as practicable in the employment of the\r\nnatives as minor postmasters and clerks. The postal system in Cuba, though\r\nremaining under the general guidance of the Postmaster-General, was made\r\nessentially independent. It was felt that it should not be a burden upon\r\nthe postal service of the United States, and provision was made that any\r\ndeficit in the postal revenue should be a charge upon the general revenues\r\nof the island.\r\n\r\nThough Puerto Rico and the Philippines hold a different relation to the\r\nUnited States, yet, for convenience of administration, the same principle\r\nof an autonomous system has been extended to them. The development of the\r\nservice in all of the islands has been rapid and successful. It has moved\r\nforward on American lines, with free delivery, money order, and registry\r\nsystems, and has given the people mail facilities far greater and more\r\nreliable than any they have ever before enjoyed. It is thus not only a\r\nvital agency of industrial, social, and business progress, but an important\r\ninfluence in diffusing a just understanding of the true spirit and\r\ncharacter of American administration.\r\n\r\nThe domestic postal service continues to grow with extraordinary rapidity.\r\nThe expenditures and the revenues will each exceed $100,000,000 during the\r\ncurrent year. Fortunately, since the revival of prosperous times the\r\nrevenues have grown much faster than the expenditures, and there is every\r\nindication that a short period will witness the obliteration of the annual\r\ndeficit. In this connection the report of the Postmaster-General embodies a\r\nstatement of some evils which have grown up outside of the contemplation of\r\nlaw in the treatment of some classes of mail matter which wrongly exercise\r\nthe privilege of the pound rate, and shows that if this matter had been\r\nproperly classified and had paid the rate which it should have paid,\r\ninstead of a postal deficit for the last fiscal year of $6,610,000, there\r\nwould have been on one basis a surplus of $17,637,570, and on another Of\r\n$5,733,836. The reform thus suggested, in the opinion of the\r\nPostmaster-General, would not only put the postal service at once on a\r\nself-sustaining basis, but would permit great and valuable improvements,\r\nand I commend the subject to the consideration of the Congress.\r\n\r\nThe Navy has maintained the spirit and high efficiency which have always\r\ncharacterized that service, and has lost none of the gallantry in heroic\r\naction which has signalized its brilliant and glorious past. The Nation has\r\nequal pride in its early and later achievements. Its habitual readiness for\r\nevery emergency has won the confidence and admiration of the country. The\r\npeople are interested in the continued preparation and prestige of the Navy\r\nand will justify liberal appropriations for its maintenance and\r\nimprovement. The officers have shown peculiar adaptation for the\r\nperformance of new and delicate duties which our recent war has imposed.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be doubted that Congress will at once make necessary provision\r\nfor the armor plate for the vessels now under contract and building. Its\r\nattention is respectfully called to the report of the Secretary of the\r\nNavy, in which the subject is fully presented. I unite in his\r\nrecommendation that the Congress enact such special legislation as may be\r\nnecessary to enable the Department to make contracts early in the coming\r\nyear for armor of the best quality that can be obtained in this country for\r\nthe Maine, Ohio, and Missouri, and that the provision of the act of March\r\n3, 1899, limiting the price of armor to $300 per ton be removed.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of naval construction Italy and Japan, of the great powers,\r\nlaid down less tonnage in the year 1899 than this country, and Italy alone\r\nhas less tonnage under construction. I heartily concur in the\r\nrecommendations for the increase of the Navy, as suggested by the\r\nSecretary.\r\n\r\nOur future progress and prosperity depend upon our ability to equal, if not\r\nsurpass, other nations in the enlargement and advance of science, industry,\r\nand commerce. To invention we must turn as one of the most powerful aids to\r\nthe accomplishment of such a result. The attention of the Congress is\r\ndirected to the report of the Commissioner of Patents, in which will be\r\nfound valuable suggestions and recommendations.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of June, 1899, the pension roll of the United States numbered\r\n991,519. These include the pensioners of the Army and Navy in all our wars.\r\nThe number added to the rolls during the year was 40,991. The number\r\ndropped by reason of death, remarriage, minors by legal limitation, failure\r\nto claim within three years, and other causes, was 43, 186, and the number\r\nof claims disallowed was 107,919. During the year 89,054 pension\r\ncertificates were issued, of which 37,077 were for new or original\r\npensions. The amount disbursed for army and navy pensions during the year\r\nwas $138,355,052.95, which was $1,651,461.61 less than the sum of the\r\nappropriations.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Army of the Republic at its recent national encampment held in\r\nPhiladelphia has brought to my attention and to that of the Congress the\r\nwisdom and justice of a modification of the third section of the act of\r\nJune 27, 1890, which provides pensions for the widows of officers and\r\nenlisted men who served ninety days or more during the War of the Rebellion\r\nand were honorably discharged, provided that such widows are without other\r\nmeans of sup, port than their daily labor and were married to the soldier,\r\nsailor, or marine on account of whose service they claim pension prior to\r\nthe date of the act.\r\n\r\nThe present holding of the Department is that if the widow's income aside\r\nfrom her daily labor does not exceed in amount what her pension would be,\r\nto wit, $96 per annum, she would be deemed to be without other means of\r\nsupport than her daily labor, and would be entitled to a pension under this\r\nact; while if the widow's income independent of the amount received by her\r\nas the result of her daily labor exceeds $96, she would not be pensionable\r\nunder the act. I am advised by the Commissioner of Pensions that the amount\r\nof the income allowed before title to pension would be barred has varied\r\nwidely under different administrations of the Pension Office, as well as\r\nduring different periods of the same administration, and has been the cause\r\nof just complaint and criticism.\r\n\r\nWith the approval of the Secretary of the Interior the Commissioner of\r\nPensions recommends that, in order to make the practice at all times\r\nuniform and to do justice to the dependent widow, the amount of income\r\nallowed independent of the proceeds of her daily labor should be not less\r\nthan $250 per annum, and he urges that the Congress shall so amend the act\r\nas to permit the Pension Office to grant pensionable status to widows under\r\nthe terms of the third section of the act of June 27, 1890, whose income\r\naside from the proceeds of daily labor is not in excess of $250 per annum.\r\nI believe this to be a simple act of justice and heartily recommend it.\r\n\r\nThe Dawes Commission reports that gratifying progress has been made in its\r\nwork during the preceding year. The field-work of enrollment of four of the\r\nnations has been completed. I recommend that Congress at an early day make\r\nliberal appropriation for educational purposes in the Indian Territory.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the act of Congress approved March 3, 1899. the\r\npreliminary work in connection with the Twelfth Census is now fully under\r\nway. The officers required for the proper administration of the duties\r\nimposed have been selected. The provision for securing a proper enumeration\r\nof the population, as well as to secure evidence of the industrial growth\r\nof the Nation, is broader and more comprehensive than any similar\r\nlegislation in the past. The Director advises that every needful effort is\r\nbeing made to push this great work to completion in the time limited by the\r\nstatute. It is believed that the Twelfth Census will emphasize our\r\nremarkable advance in all that pertains to national progress.\r\n\r\nUnder the authority of the act of Congress approved July 7, 1898, the\r\ncommission consisting of the Secretary of the Treasury, the\r\nAttorney-General, and the Secretary of the Interior has made an agreement\r\nof settlement, which has had my approval, of the indebtedness to the\r\nGovernment growing out of the issue of bonds to aid in the construction of\r\nthe Central Pacific and Western Pacific railroads. The agreement secures\r\nto the Government the principal and interest of said bonds, amounting to\r\n$58,812,715.48. There has been paid thereon $11,762,543.12, which has been\r\ncovered into the Treasury, and the remainder, payable within ten years,\r\nwith interest at the rate Of 3 per cent per annum, payable semiannually, is\r\nsecured by the deposit of an equal amount of first-mortgage bonds of the\r\nPacific Railway companies. The amounts paid and secured to be paid to the\r\nGovernment on account of the Pacific Railroad subsidy claims are: Union\r\nPacific, cash - $58,448,223.75\r\n\r\nKansas Pacific, cash - 6,303,000.00\r\n\r\nCentral and Western Pacific, cash - 11,798,314.14\r\n\r\nNotes, secured - 47,050,172.36\r\n\r\nKansas Pacific--dividends for deficiency due United States, cash -\r\n821,897.70 -\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nWilliam McKinley\r\nDecember 3, 1900\r\n\r\nTo the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nAt the outgoing of the old and the incoming of the new century you begin\r\nthe last session of the Fifty-sixth Congress with evidences on every hand\r\nof individual and national prosperity and with proof of the growing\r\nstrength and increasing power for good of Republican institutions. Your\r\ncountrymen will join with you in felicitation that American liberty is more\r\nfirmly established than ever before, and that love for it and the\r\ndetermination to preserve it are more universal than at any former period\r\nof our history.\r\n\r\nThe Republic was never so strong, because never so strongly entrenched in\r\nthe hearts of the people as now. The Constitution, with few amendments,\r\nexists as it left the hands of its authors. The additions which have been\r\nmade to it proclaim larger freedom and more extended citizenship. Popular\r\ngovernment has demonstrated in its one hundred and twenty-four years of\r\ntrial here its stability and security, and its efficiency as the best\r\ninstrument of national development and the best safeguard to human rights.\r\n\r\nWhen the Sixth Congress assembled in November, 1800, the population of the\r\nUnited States was 5,308,483. It is now 76,304,799. Then we had sixteen\r\nStates. Now we have forty-five. Then our territory consisted Of 909,050\r\nsquare miles. It is now 3,846,595 square miles. Education, religion, and\r\nmorality have kept pace with our advancement in other directions, and while\r\nextending its power the Government has adhered to its foundation principles\r\nand abated none of them in dealing with our new peoples and possessions. A\r\nnation so preserved and blessed gives reverent thanks to God and invokes\r\nHis guidance and the continuance of His care and favor.\r\n\r\nIn our foreign intercourse the dominant question has been the treatment of\r\nthe Chinese problem. Apart from this our relations with the powers have\r\nbeen happy.\r\n\r\nThe recent troubles in China spring from the antiforeign agitation which\r\nfor the past three years has gained strength in the northern provinces.\r\nTheir origin lies deep in the character of the Chinese races and in the\r\ntraditions of their Government. The Taiping rebellion and the opening of\r\nChinese ports to foreign trade and settlement disturbed alike the\r\nhomogeneity and the seclusion of China.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile foreign activity made itself felt in all quarters, not alone on\r\nthe coast, but along the great river arteries and in the remoter districts,\r\ncarrying new ideas and introducing new associations among a primitive\r\npeople which had pursued for centuries a national policy of isolation.\r\n\r\nThe telegraph and the railway spreading over their land, the steamers\r\nplying on their waterways, the merchant and the missionary penetrating year\r\nby year farther to the interior, became to the Chinese mind types of an\r\nalien invasion, changing the course of their national life and fraught with\r\nvague forebodings of disaster to their beliefs and their self-control.\r\n\r\nFor several years before the present troubles all the resources of foreign\r\ndiplomacy, backed by moral demonstrations of the physical force of fleets\r\nand arms, have been needed to secure due respect for the treaty rights of\r\nforeigners and to obtain satisfaction from the responsible authorities for\r\nthe sporadic outrages upon the persons and property of unoffending\r\nsojourners, which from time to time occurred at widely separated points in\r\nthe northern provinces, as in the case of the outbreaks in Sze-chuen and\r\nShan-tung.\r\n\r\nPosting of antiforeign placards became a daily occurrence, which the\r\nrepeated reprobation of the Imperial power failed to check or punish. These\r\ninflammatory appeals to the ignorance and superstition of the masses,\r\nmendacious and absurd in their accusations and deeply hostile in their\r\nspirit, could not but work cumulative harm. They aimed at no particular\r\nclass of foreigners; they were impartial in attacking everything foreign.\r\n\r\nAn outbreak in Shan-tung, in which German missionaries were slain, was the\r\ntoo natural result of these malevolent teachings.\r\n\r\nThe posting of seditious placards, exhorting to the utter destruction of\r\nforeigners and of every foreign thing, continued unrebuked. Hostile\r\ndemonstrations toward the stranger gained strength by organization.\r\n\r\nThe sect, commonly styled the Boxers, developed greatly in the provinces\r\nnorth of the Yang-Tse, and with the collusion of many notable officials,\r\nincluding some in the immediate councils of the Throne itself, became\r\nalarmingly aggressive. No foreigner's life, outside of the protected treaty\r\nports, was safe. No foreign interest was secure from spoliation.\r\n\r\nThe diplomatic representatives of the powers in Peking strove in vain to\r\ncheck this movement. Protest was followed by demand and demand by renewed\r\nprotest, to be met with perfunctory edicts from the Palace and evasive and\r\nfutile assurances from the Tsung-li Yamen. The circle of the Boxer\r\ninfluence narrowed about Peking, and while nominally stigmatized as\r\nseditious, it was felt that its spirit pervaded the capital itself, that\r\nthe Imperial forces were imbued with its doctrines, and that the immediate\r\ncounselors of the Empress Dowager were in full sympathy with the\r\nantiforeign movement.\r\n\r\nThe increasing gravity of the conditions in China and the imminence of\r\nperil to our own diversified interests in the Empire, as well as to those\r\nof all the other treaty governments, were soon appreciated by this\r\nGovernment, causing it profound solicitude. The United States from the\r\nearliest days of foreign intercourse with China had followed a policy of\r\npeace, omitting no occasions to testify good will, to further the extension\r\nof lawful trade, to respect the sovereignty of its Government, and to\r\ninsure by all legitimate and kindly but earnest means the fullest measure\r\nof protection for the lives and property of our law-abiding citizens and\r\nfor the exercise of their beneficent callings among the Chinese people.\r\n\r\nMindful of this, it was felt to be appropriate that our purposes should be\r\npronounced in favor of such course as would hasten united action of the\r\npowers at Peking to promote the administrative reforms so greatly needed\r\nfor strengthening the Imperial Government and maintaining the integrity of\r\nChina, in which we believed the whole western world to be alike concerned.\r\nTo these ends I caused to be addressed to the several powers occupying\r\nterritory and maintaining spheres of influence in China the circular\r\nproposals of 1899, inviting from them declarations of their intentions and\r\nviews as to the desirability of the adoption of measures insuring the\r\nbenefits of equality of treatment of all foreign trade throughout China.\r\n\r\nWith gratifying unanimity the responses coincided in this common policy,\r\nenabling me to see in the successful termination of these negotiations\r\nproof of the friendly spirit which animates the various powers interested\r\nin the untrammeled development of commerce and industry in the Chinese\r\nEmpire as a source of vast benefit to the whole commercial world.\r\n\r\nIn this conclusion, which I had the gratification to announce as a\r\ncompleted engagement to the interested powers on March 20, 1900, I\r\nhopefully discerned a potential factor for the abatement of the distrust of\r\nforeign purposes which for a year past had appeared to inspire the policy\r\nof the Imperial Government, and for the effective exertion by it of power\r\nand authority to quell the critical antiforeign movement in the northern\r\nprovinces most immediately influenced by the Manchu sentiment.\r\n\r\nSeeking to testify confidence in the willingness and ability of the\r\nImperial administration to redress the wrongs and prevent the evils we\r\nsuffered and feared, the marine guard, which had been sent to Peking in the\r\nautumn of 1899 for the protection of the legation, was withdrawn at the\r\nearliest practicable moment, and all pending questions were remitted, as\r\nfar as we were concerned, to the ordinary resorts of diplomatic\r\nintercourse.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese Government proved, however, unable to check the rising strength\r\nof the Boxers and appeared to be a prey to internal dissensions. In the\r\nunequal contest the antiforeign influences soon gained the ascendancy under\r\nthe leadership of Prince Tuan. Organized armies of Boxers, with which the\r\nImperial forces affiliated, held the country between Peking and the coast,\r\npenetrated into Manchuria up to the Russian borders, and through their\r\nemissaries threatened a like rising throughout northern China.\r\n\r\nAttacks upon foreigners, destruction of their property, and slaughter of\r\nnative converts were reported from all sides. The Tsung-li Yamen, already\r\npermeated with hostile sympathies, could make no effective response to the\r\nappeals of the legations. At this critical juncture, in the early spring of\r\nthis year, a proposal was made by the other powers that a combined fleet\r\nshould be assembled in Chinese waters as a moral demonstration, under cover\r\nof which to exact of the Chinese Government respect for foreign treaty\r\nrights and the suppression of the Boxers.\r\n\r\nThe United States, while not participating in the joint demonstration,\r\npromptly sent from the Philippines all ships that could be spared for\r\nservice on the Chinese coast. A small force of marines was landed at Taku\r\nand sent to Peking for the protection of the American legation. Other\r\npowers took similar action, until some four hundred men were assembled in\r\nthe capital as legation guards.\r\n\r\nStill the peril increased. The legations reported the development of the\r\nseditious movement in Peking and the need of increased provision for\r\ndefense against it. While preparations were in progress for a larger\r\nexpedition, to strengthen the legation guards and keep the railway open, an\r\nattempt of the foreign ships to make a landing at Taku was met by a fire\r\nfrom the Chinese forts. The forts were thereupon shelled by the foreign\r\nvessels, the American admiral taking no part in the attack, on the ground\r\nthat we were not at war with China and that a hostile demonstration might\r\nconsolidate the antiforeign elements and strengthen the Boxers to oppose\r\nthe relieving column.\r\n\r\nTwo days later the Taku forts were captured after a sanguinary conflict.\r\nSeverance of communication with Peking followed, and a combined force of\r\nadditional guards, which was advancing to Peking by the Pei-Ho, was checked\r\nat Langfang. The isolation of the legations was complete.\r\n\r\nThe siege and the relief of the legations has passed into undying history.\r\nIn all the stirring chapter which records the heroism of the devoted band,\r\nclinging to hope in the face of despair, and the undaunted spirit that led\r\ntheir relievers through battle and suffering to the goal, it is a memory of\r\nwhich my countrymen may be justly proud that the honor of our flag was\r\nmaintained alike in the siege and the rescue, and that stout American\r\nhearts have again set high, in fervent emulation with true men of other\r\nrace and language, the indomitable courage that ever strives for the cause\r\nof right and justice.\r\n\r\nBy June 19 the legations were cut off. An identical note from the, Yamen\r\nordered each minister to leave Peking, under a promised escort, within\r\ntwenty-four hours. To gain time they replied, asking prolongation of the\r\ntime, which was afterwards granted, and requesting an interview with the\r\nTsung-li Yamen on the following day. No reply being received, on the\r\nmorning of the 20th the German minister, Baron von Ketteler, set out for\r\nthe Yamen to obtain a response, and oil the way was murdered.\r\n\r\nAn attempt by the legation guard to recover his body was foiled by the\r\nChinese. Armed forces turned out against the legations. Their quarters were\r\nsurrounded and attacked. The mission compounds were abandoned, their\r\ninmates taking refuge in the British legation, where all the other\r\nlegations and guards gathered for more effective defense. Four hundred\r\npersons were crowded in its narrow compass. Two thousand native converts\r\nwere assembled in a nearby palace under protection of the foreigners. Lines\r\nof defense were strengthened, trenches dug, barricades raised, and\r\npreparations made to stand a siege, which at once began.\r\n\r\nFrom June 20 until July 17, writes Minister Conger, \"there was scarcely\r\nan hour during which there was not firing upon some part of our lines and\r\ninto some of the legations, varying from a single shot to a general and\r\ncontinuous attack along the whole line.\" Artillery was placed around the\r\nlegations and on the over-looking palace walls, and thousands Of 3-inch\r\nshot and shell were fired, destroying some buildings and damaging all. So\r\nthickly did the balls rain, that, when the ammunition of the besieged ran\r\nlow, five quarts of Chinese bullets were gathered in an hour in one\r\ncompound and recast.\r\n\r\nAttempts were made to burn the legations by setting neighboring houses on\r\nfire, but the flames were successfully fought off, although the Austrian,\r\nBelgian, Italian. and Dutch legations were then and subsequently burned.\r\nWith the aid of the native converts, directed by the missionaries, to whose\r\nhelpful co-operation Mr. Conger awards unstinted praise, the British\r\nlegation was made a veritable fortress. The British minister, Sir Claude\r\nMacDonald, was chosen general commander of the defense, with the secretary\r\nof the American legation, Mr. E. G. Squiers, as chief of staff.\r\n\r\nTo save life and ammunition the besieged sparingly returned the incessant\r\nfire of the Chinese soldiery, fighting only to repel attack or make an\r\noccasional successful sortie for strategic advantage, such as that of\r\nfifty-five American, British, and Russian marines led by Captain Myers, of\r\nthe United States Marine Corps, which resulted in the capture of a\r\nformidable barricade on the wall that gravely menaced the American\r\nposition. It was held to the last, and proved an invaluable acquisition,\r\nbecause commanding the water gate through which the relief column entered.\r\n\r\nDuring the siege the defenders lost 65 killed, 135 wounded, and 7 by\r\ndisease, the last all children.\r\n\r\nOn July 14 the besieged had their first communication with the Tsung-li\r\nYamen, from whom a message came inviting to a conference, which was\r\ndeclined. Correspondence, however, ensued and a sort of armistice was\r\nagreed upon, which stopped the bombardment and lessened the rifle fire for\r\na time. Even then no protection whatever was afforded, nor any aid given,\r\nsave to send to the legations a small supply of fruit and three sacks of\r\nflour.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the only communication had with the Chinese Government related to\r\nthe occasional delivery or dispatch of a telegram or to the demands of the\r\nTsung-li Yamen for the withdrawal of the legations to the coast under\r\nescort. Not only are the protestations of the Chinese Government that it\r\nprotected and succored the legations positively contradicted, but\r\nirresistible proof accumulates that the attacks upon them were made by\r\nImperial troops, regularly uniformed, armed, and officered, belonging to\r\nthe command of Jung Lu, the Imperial commander in chief. Decrees\r\nencouraging the Boxers, organizing them tinder prominent Imperial officers,\r\nprovisioning them, and even granting them large sums in the name of the\r\nEmpress Dowager, are known to exist. Members of the Tsung-li Yamen who\r\ncounseled protection of the foreigners were beheaded. Even in the distant\r\nprovinces men suspected of foreign sympathy were put to death, prominent\r\namong these being Chang Yen-hoon, formerly Chinese minister in Washington.\r\n\r\nWith the negotiation of the partial armistice of July 14, a proceeding\r\nwhich was doubtless promoted by the representations of the Chinese envoy in\r\nWashington, the way was opened for the conveyance to Mr. Conger of a test\r\nmessage sent by the Secretary of State through the kind offices of Minister\r\nWu Ting-fang. Mr. Conger's reply, dispatched from Peking on July 18 through\r\nthe same channel, afforded to the outside world the first tidings that the\r\ninmates of the legations were still alive and hoping for succor.\r\n\r\nThis news stimulated the preparations for a joint relief expedition in\r\nnumbers sufficient to overcome the resistance which for a month had been\r\norganizing between Taku and the capital. Reinforcements sent by all the\r\nco-operating Governments were constantly arriving. The United States\r\ncontingent, hastily assembled from the Philippines or dispatched from this\r\ncountry, amounted to some 5,000 men, under the able command first of the\r\nlamented Colonel Liscurn and afterwards of General Chaffee.\r\n\r\nToward the end of July the movement began. A severe conflict followed at\r\nTientsin, in which Colonel Liscurn was killed. The city was stormed and\r\npartly destroyed. Its capture afforded the base of operations from which to\r\nmake the final advance, which began in the first days of August, the\r\nexpedition being made up of Japanese, Russian, British, and American troops\r\nat the outset.\r\n\r\nAnother battle was fought and won at Yangtsun. Thereafter the disheartened\r\nChinese troops offered little show of resistance. A few days later the\r\nimportant position of Ho-si-woo was taken. A rapid march brought the united\r\nforces to the populous city of Tung Chow, which capitulated without a\r\ncontest.\r\n\r\nOn August 14 the capital was reached. After a brief conflict beneath the\r\nwalls the relief column entered and the legations were saved. The United\r\nStates soldiers, sailors, and marines, officers and men alike, in those\r\ndistant climes and unusual surroundings, showed the same valor, discipline,\r\nand good conduct and gave proof of the same high degree of intelligence and\r\nefficiency which have distinguished them in every emergency.\r\n\r\nThe Imperial family and the Government had fled a few days before. The city\r\nwas without visible control. The remaining Imperial soldiery had made on\r\nthe night of the 13th a last attempt to exterminate the besieged, which was\r\ngallantly repelled. It fell to the occupying forces to restore order and\r\norganize a provisional administration.\r\n\r\nHappily the acute disturbances were confined to the northern provinces. It\r\nis a relief to recall and a pleasure to record the loyal conduct of the\r\nviceroys and local authorities of the southern and eastern provinces. Their\r\nefforts were continuously directed to the pacific control of the vast\r\npopulations under their rule and to the scrupulous observance of foreign\r\ntreaty rights. At critical moments they did not hesitate to memorialize the\r\nThrone, urging the protection of the legations, the restoration of\r\ncommunication, and the assertion of the Imperial authority against the\r\nsubversive elements. They maintained excellent relations with the official\r\nrepresentatives of foreign powers. To their kindly disposition is largely\r\ndue the success of the consuls in removing many of the missionaries from\r\nthe interior to places of safety. In this relation the action of the\r\nconsuls should be highly commended. In Shan-tung and eastern Chi-li the\r\ntask was difficult, but, thanks to their energy and the cooperation of\r\nAmerican and foreign naval commanders, hundreds of foreigners, including\r\nthose of other nationalities than ours, were rescued from imminent peril.\r\n\r\nThe policy of the United States through all this trying period was clearly\r\nannounced and scrupulously carried out. A circular note to the powers dated\r\nJuly 3 proclaimed our attitude. Treating the condition in the north as one\r\nof virtual anarchy, in which the great provinces of the south and southeast\r\nhad no share, we regarded the local authorities in the latter quarters as\r\nrepresenting the Chinese people with whom we sought to remain in peace and\r\nfriendship. Our declared aims involved no war against the Chinese nation.\r\nWe adhered to the legitimate office of rescuing the imperiled legation,\r\nobtaining redress for wrongs already suffered, securing wherever possible\r\nthe safety of American life and property in China, and preventing a spread\r\nof the disorders or their recurrence.\r\n\r\nAs was then said, \"The policy of the Government of the United States is to\r\nseek a solution which may bring about permanent safety and peace to China,\r\npreserve Chinese territorial and administrative entity, protect all rights\r\nguaranteed to friendly powers by treaty and international law, and\r\nsafeguard for the world the principle of equal and impartial trade with all\r\nparts of the Chinese Empire.\"\r\n\r\nFaithful to those professions which, as it proved, reflected the views and\r\npurposes of the other co-operating Governments, all our efforts have been\r\ndirected toward ending the anomalous situation in China by negotiations for\r\na settlement at the earliest possible moment. As soon as the sacred duty of\r\nrelieving our legation and its dependents was accomplished we withdrew from\r\nactive hostilities, leaving our legation under an adequate guard in Peking\r\nas a channel of negotiation and settlement--a course adopted by others of\r\nthe interested powers. Overtures of the empowered representatives of the\r\nChinese Emperor have been considerately entertained.\r\n\r\nThe Russian proposition looking to the restoration of the Imperial power in\r\nPeking has been accepted as in full consonance with our own desires, for we\r\nhave held and hold that effective reparation for wrongs suffered and an\r\nenduring settlement that will make their recurrence impossible can best be\r\nbrought about under an authority which the Chinese nation reverences and\r\nobeys. While so doing we forego no jot of our undoubted right to exact\r\nexemplary and deterrent punishment of the responsible authors and abettors\r\nof the criminal acts whereby we and other nations have suffered grievous\r\ninjury.\r\n\r\nFor the real culprits, the evil counselors who have misled the Imperial\r\njudgment and diverted the sovereign authority to their own guilty ends,\r\nfull expiation becomes imperative within the rational limits of retributive\r\nJustice. Regarding this as the initial condition of an acceptable\r\nsettlement between China and the powers, I said in my message of October 18\r\nto the Chinese Emperor: I trust that negotiations may begin so soon as we\r\nand the other offended Governments shall be effectively satisfied of Your\r\nMajesty's ability and power to treat with just sternness the principal\r\noffenders, who are doubly culpable, not alone toward the foreigners, but\r\ntoward Your Majesty, under whose rule the purpose of China to dwell in\r\nconcord with the world had hitherto found expression in the welcome and\r\nprotection assured to strangers. Taking, as a point of departure, the\r\nImperial edict appointing Earl Li Hung Chang and Prince Ching\r\nplenipotentiaries to arrange a settlement, and the edict of September 25,\r\nwhereby certain high officials were designated for punishment, this\r\nGovernment has moved, in concert with the other powers, toward the opening\r\nof negotiations, which Mr. Conger, assisted by Mr. Rockhill, has been\r\nauthorized to conduct on behalf of the United States.\r\n\r\nGeneral bases of negotiation formulated by the Government of the French\r\nRepublic have been accepted with certain reservations as to details, made\r\nnecessary by our own circumstances, but, like similar reservations by other\r\npowers, open to discussion in the progress of the negotiations. The\r\ndisposition of the Emperor's Government to admit liability for wrongs done\r\nto foreign Governments and their nationals, and to act upon such additional\r\ndesignation of the guilty persons as the foreign ministers at Peking may be\r\nin a position to make, gives hope of a complete settlement of all questions\r\ninvolved, assuring foreign rights of residence and intercourse on terms of\r\nequality for all the world.\r\n\r\nI regard as one of the essential factors of a durable adjustment the\r\nsecurement of adequate guarantees for liberty of faith, since insecurity of\r\nthose natives who may embrace alien creeds is a scarcely less effectual\r\nassault upon the rights of foreign worship and teaching than would be the\r\ndirect invasion thereof.\r\n\r\nThe matter of indemnity for our wronged citizens is a question of grave\r\nconcern. Measured in money alone, a sufficient reparation may prove to be\r\nbeyond the ability of China to meet. All the powers concur in emphatic\r\ndisclaimers of any purpose of aggrandizement through the dismemberment of\r\nthe Empire. I am disposed to think that due compensation may be made in\r\npart by increased guarantees of security for foreign rights and immunities,\r\nand, most important of all, by the opening of China to the equal commerce\r\nof all the world. These views have been and will be earnestly advocated by\r\nour representatives.\r\n\r\nThe Government of Russia has put forward a suggestion, that in the event of\r\nprotracted divergence of views in regard to indemnities the matter may be\r\nrelegated to the Court of Arbitration at The Hague. I favorably incline to\r\nthis, believing that high tribunal could not fail to reach a solution no\r\nless conducive to the stability and enlarged prosperity of China itself\r\nthan immediately beneficial to the powers.\r\n\r\nRatifications of a treaty of extradition with the Argentine Republic were\r\nexchanged on June 2 last.\r\n\r\nWhile the Austro-Hungarian Government has in the many cases that have been\r\nreported of the arrest of our naturalized citizens for alleged evasion of\r\nmilitary service faithfully observed the provisions of the treaty and\r\nreleased such persons from military obligations, it has in some instances\r\nexpelled those whose presence in the community of their origin was asserted\r\nto have a pernicious influence. Representations have been made against this\r\ncourse whenever its adoption has appeared unduly onerous.\r\n\r\nWe have been urgently solicited by Belgium to ratify the International\r\nConvention of June, 1899, amendatory of the previous Convention of 1890 in\r\nrespect to the regulation of the liquor trade in Africa. Compliance was\r\nnecessarily withheld, in the absence of the advice and consent of the\r\nSenate thereto. The principle involved has the cordial sympathy of this\r\nGovernment, which in the reversionary negotiations advocated more drastic\r\nmeasures, and I would gladly see its extension, by international agreement,\r\nto the restriction of the liquor traffic with all uncivilized peoples,\r\nespecially in the Western Pacific.\r\n\r\nA conference will be held at Brussels December 11, 1900, under the\r\nConvention for the protection of industrial property, concluded at Paris\r\nMarch 20, 1883, to which delegates from this country have been appointed.\r\nAny lessening of the difficulties that our inventors encounter in obtaining\r\npatents abroad for their inventions and that our farmers, manufacturers,\r\nand merchants may have in the protection of their trade-marks is worthy of\r\ncareful consideration, and your attention will be called to the results of\r\nthe conference at the proper time.\r\n\r\nIn the interest of expanding trade between this country and South America,\r\nefforts have been made during the past year to conclude conventions with\r\nthe southern republics for the enlargement of postal facilities. Two such\r\nagreements, signed with Bolivia on April 24, of which that establishing the\r\nmoney-order system is undergoing certain changes suggested by the\r\nPost-Office Department, have not yet been ratified by this Government. A\r\ntreaty of extradition with that country, signed on the same day, is before\r\nthe Senate.\r\n\r\nA boundary dispute between Brazil and Bolivia over the territory of Acre is\r\nin a fair way of friendly adjustment, a protocol signed in December, 1899,\r\nhaving agreed on a definite frontier and provided for its demarcation by a\r\njoint commission.\r\n\r\nConditions in Brazil have weighed heavily on our export trade to that\r\ncountry in marked contrast to the favorable conditions upon which Brazilian\r\nproducts are admitted into our markets. Urgent representations have been\r\nmade to that Government on the subject and some amelioration has been\r\neffected. We rely upon the reciprocal justice and good will of that\r\nGovernment to assure to us a further improvement in our commercial\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\nThe Convention signed May 24, 1897, for the final settlement of claims left\r\nin abeyance upon the dissolution of the Commission of 1893, was at length\r\nratified by the Chilean Congress and the supplemental Commission has been\r\norganized.\r\n\r\nIt remains for the Congress to appropriate for the necessary expenses of\r\nthe Commission.\r\n\r\nThe insurrectionary movement which disturbed Colombia in the latter part of\r\n1899 has been practically suppressed, although guerrillas still operate in\r\nsome departments. The executive power of that Republic changed hands in\r\nAugust last by the act of Vice-President Marroquin in assuming the reins of\r\ngovernment during the absence of President San Clemente from the capital.\r\nThe change met with no serious opposition, and, following the precedents in\r\nsuch cases, the United States minister entered into relations with the new\r\ndefacto Government on September 17.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to announce that the residual questions between Costa Rica\r\nand Nicaragua growing out of the Award of President Cleveland in 1888 have\r\nbeen adjusted through the choice of an American engineer, General E. P.\r\nAlexander, as umpire to run the disputed line. His task has been\r\naccomplished to the satisfaction of both contestants.\r\n\r\nA revolution in the Dominican Republic toward the close of last year\r\nresulted in the installation of President Jimenez, whose Government was\r\nformally recognized in January. Since then final payment has been made of\r\nthe American claim in regard to the Ozama bridge.\r\n\r\nThe year of the exposition has been fruitful in occasions for displaying\r\nthe good will that exists between this country and France. This great\r\ncompetition brought together from every nation the best in natural\r\nproductions, industry, science, and the arts, submitted in generous rivalry\r\nto a judgment made all the more searching because of that rivalry. The\r\nextraordinary increase of exportations from this country during the past\r\nthree years and the activity with which our inventions and wares had\r\ninvaded new markets caused much interest to center upon the American\r\nexhibit, and every encouragement was offered in the way of space and\r\nfacilities to permit of its being comprehensive as a whole and complete in\r\nevery part.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, not an easy task to assemble exhibits that could fitly\r\nillustrate our diversified resources and manufactures. Singularly enough,\r\nour national prosperity lessened the incentive to exhibit. The dealer in\r\nraw materials knew that the user must come to him; the great factories were\r\ncontented with the phenomenal demand for their output, not alone at home,\r\nbut also abroad, where merit had already won a profitable trade.\r\n\r\nAppeals had to be made to the patriotism of exhibitors to induce them to\r\nincur outlays promising no immediate return. This was especially the case\r\nwhere it became needful to complete an industrial sequence or illustrate a\r\nclass of processes. One manufacturer after another had to be visited and\r\nimportuned, and at times, after a promise to exhibit in a particular\r\nsection had been obtained, it would be withdrawn, owing to pressure of\r\ntrade orders, and a new quest would have to be made.\r\n\r\nThe installation of exhibits, too, encountered many obstacles and involved\r\nunexpected cost. The exposition was far from ready at the date fixed for\r\nits opening. The French transportation lines were congested with offered\r\nfreight. Belated goods had to be hastily installed in unfinished quarters\r\nwith whatever labor could be obtained in the prevailing confusion. Nor was\r\nthe task of the Commission lightened by the fact that, owing to the scheme\r\nof classification adopted, it was impossible to have the entire exhibit of\r\nany one country in the same building or more than one group of exhibits in\r\nthe same part of any building. Our installations were scattered on both\r\nsides of the Seine and in widely remote suburbs of Paris, so that\r\nadditional assistants were needed for the work of supervision and\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\nDespite all these drawbacks the contribution of the United States was not\r\nonly the largest foreign display, but was among the earliest in place and\r\nthe most orderly in arrangement. Our exhibits were shown in one hundred and\r\none out of one hundred and twenty-one classes, and more completely covered\r\nthe entire classification than those of any other nation. In total number\r\nthey ranked next after those of France, and the attractive form in which\r\nthey were presented secured general attention.\r\n\r\nA criterion of the extent and success of our participation and of the\r\nthoroughness with which our exhibits were organized is seen in the awards\r\ngranted to American exhibitors by the international jury, namely, grand\r\nprizes, 240; gold medals, 597; silver medals, 776; bronze medals, 541, and\r\nhonorable mentions, 322--2,476 in all, being the greatest total number\r\ngiven to the exhibit of any exhibiting nation, as well as the largest\r\nnumber in each grade. This significant recognition of merit in competition\r\nwith the chosen exhibits of all other nations and at the hands of juries\r\nalmost wholly made up of representatives of France and other competing\r\ncountries is not only most gratifying, but is especially valuable, since it\r\nsets us to the front in international questions of supply and demand, while\r\nthe large proportion of awards in the classes of art and artistic\r\nmanufactures afforded unexpected proof of the stimulation of national\r\nculture by the prosperity that flows from natural productiveness joined to\r\nindustrial excellence.\r\n\r\nApart from the exposition several occasions for showing international good\r\nwill occurred. The inauguration in Paris of the Lafayette Monument,\r\npresented by the school children of the United States, and the designing of\r\na commemorative coin by our Mint and the presentation of the first piece\r\nstruck to the President of the Republic, were marked by appropriate\r\nceremonies, and the Fourth of July was especially observed in the French\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\nGood will prevails in our relations with the German Empire. An amicable\r\nadjustment of the long-pending question of the admission of our\r\nlife-insurance companies to do business in Prussia has been reached. One of\r\nthe principal companies has already been readmitted and the way is opened\r\nfor the others to share the privilege.\r\n\r\nThe settlement of the Samoan problem, to which I adverted in my last\r\nmessage, has accomplished good results. Peace and contentment prevail in\r\nthe islands, especially in Tutuila, where a convenient administration that\r\nhas won the confidence and esteem of the kindly disposed natives has been\r\norganized under the direction of the commander of the United States naval\r\nstation at Pago-Pago.\r\n\r\nAn Imperial meat inspection law has been enacted for Germany. While it may\r\nsimplify the inspections, it prohibits certain products heretofore\r\nadmitted. There is still great uncertainty as to whether our well-nigh\r\nextinguished German trade in meat products can revive tinder its new\r\nburdens. Much will depend upon regulations not yet promulgated, which we\r\nconfidently hope will be free from the discriminations which attended the\r\nenforcement of the old statutes.\r\n\r\nThe remaining link in the new lines of direct telegraphic communication\r\nbetween the United States and the German Empire has recently been\r\ncompleted, affording a gratifying occasion for exchange of friendly\r\ncongratulations with the German Emperor.\r\n\r\nOur friendly relations with Great Britain continue. The war in Southern\r\nAfrica introduced important questions. A condition unusual in international\r\nwars was presented in that while one belligerent had control of the seas,\r\nthe other had no ports, shipping, or direct trade, but was only accessible\r\nthrough the territory of a neutral. Vexatious questions arose through Great\r\nBritain's action in respect to neutral cargoes, not contraband in their own\r\nnature, shipped to Portuguese South Africa, on the score of probable or\r\nsuspected ultimate destination to the Boer States.\r\n\r\nSuch consignments in British ships, by which alone direct trade is kept up\r\nbetween our ports and Southern Africa, were seized in application of a\r\nmunicipal law prohibiting British vessels from trading with the enemy\r\nwithout regard to any contraband character of the goods, while cargoes\r\nshipped to Delagoa Bay in neutral bottoms were arrested on the ground of\r\nalleged destination to enemy's country. Appropriate representations on our\r\npart resulted in the British Government agreeing to purchase outright all\r\nsuch goods shown to be the actual property of American citizens, thus\r\nclosing the incident to the satisfaction of the immediately interested\r\nparties, although, unfortunately, without a broad settlement of the\r\nquestion of a neutral's right to send goods not contraband per se to a\r\nneutral port adjacent to a belligerent area.\r\n\r\nThe work of marking certain provisional boundary points, for convenience of\r\nadministration, around the head of Lynn Canal, in accordance with the\r\ntemporary arrangement of October, 1899, Was completed by a joint survey in\r\nJuly last. The modus vivendi has so far worked without friction, and the\r\nDominion Government has provided rules and regulations for securing to our\r\ncitizens the benefit of the reciprocal stipulation that the citizens or\r\nsubjects of either power found by that arrangement within the temporary\r\njurisdiction of the other shall suffer no diminution of the rights and\r\nprivileges they have hitherto enjoyed. But however necessary such an\r\nexpedient may have been to tide over the grave emergencies of the\r\nsituation, it is at best but an unsatisfactory makeshift, which should not\r\nbe suffered to delay the speedy and complete establishment of the frontier\r\nline to which we are entitled under the Russo-American treaty for the\r\ncession of Alaska.\r\n\r\nIn this relation I may refer again to the need of definitely marking the\r\nAlaskan boundary where it follows the one hundred and forty-first meridian.\r\nA convention to that end has been before the Senate for some two years, but\r\nas no action has been taken I contemplate negotiating a new convention for\r\na joint determination of the meridian by telegraphic observations. These,\r\nit is believed, will give more accurate and unquestionable results than the\r\nsidereal methods heretofore independently followed, which, as is known,\r\nproved discrepant at several points on the line, although not varying at\r\nany place more than 700 feet.\r\n\r\nThe pending claim of R. H. May against the Guatemalan Government has been\r\nsettled by arbitration, Mr. George F. B. Jenner, British minister at\r\nGuatemala, who was chosen as sole arbitrator, having awarded $143,750.73 in\r\ngold to the claimant.\r\n\r\nVarious American claims against Haiti have been or are being advanced to\r\nthe resort of arbitration.\r\n\r\nAs the result of negotiations with the Government of Honduras in regard to\r\nthe indemnity demanded for the murder of Frank H. Pears in Honduras, that\r\nGovernment has paid $10,000 in settlement of the claim of the heirs.\r\n\r\nThe assassination of King Humbert called forth sincere expressions of\r\nsorrow from this Government and people, and occasion was fitly taken to\r\ntestify to the Italian nation the high regard here felt for the memory of\r\nthe lamented ruler.\r\n\r\nIn my last message I referred at considerable length to the lynching of\r\nfive Italians at Tallulah. Notwithstanding the efforts of the Federal\r\nGovernment, the production of evidence tending to inculpate the authors of\r\nthis grievous offense against our civilization, and the repeated inquests\r\nset on foot by the authorities of the State of Louisiana, no punishments\r\nhave followed. Successive grand juries have failed to indict. The\r\nrepresentations of the Italian Government in the face of this miscarriage\r\nhave been most temperate and just.\r\n\r\nSetting the principle at issue high above all consideration of merely\r\npecuniary indemnification, such as this Government made in the three\r\nprevious cases, Italy has solemnly invoked the pledges of existing treaty\r\nand asked that the justice to which she is entitled shall be meted in\r\nregard to her unfortunate countrymen in our territory with the same full\r\nmeasure she herself would give to any American were his reciprocal treaty\r\nrights contemned.\r\n\r\nI renew the urgent recommendations I made last year that the Congress\r\nappropriately confer upon the Federal courts jurisdiction in this class of\r\ninternational cases where the ultimate responsibility of the Federal\r\nGovernment may be involved, and I invite action upon the bills to\r\naccomplish this which were introduced in the Sen. ate and House. It is\r\nincumbent upon us to remedy the statutory omission which has led, and may\r\nagain lead, to such untoward results. I have pointed out the necessity and\r\nthe precedent for legislation of this character. Its enactment is a simple\r\nmeasure of previsory justice toward the nations with which we as a\r\nsovereign equal make treaties requiring reciprocal observance.\r\n\r\nWhile the Italian Government naturally regards such action as the primary\r\nand, indeed, the most essential element in the disposal of the Tallulah\r\nincident, I advise that, in accordance with precedent, and in view of the\r\nimprobability of that particular case being reached by the bill now\r\npending, Congress make gracious provision for indemnity to the Italian\r\nsufferers in the same form and proportion as heretofore.\r\n\r\nIn my inaugural address I referred to the general subject of lynching in\r\nthese words: Lynching must not be tolerated in a great and civilized\r\ncountry like the United States; courts, not mobs, must execute the\r\npenalties of the law. The preservation of public order, the right of\r\ndiscussion, the integrity of courts, and the orderly administration of\r\njustice must continue forever the rock of safety upon which our Government\r\nsecurely rests. This I most urgently reiterate and again invite the\r\nattention of my countrymen to this reproach upon our civilization.\r\n\r\nThe closing year has witnessed a decided strengthening of Japan's relations\r\nto other states. The development of her independent judicial and\r\nadministrative functions under the treaties which took effect July 17,\r\n1899, has proceeded without international friction, showing the competence\r\nof the Japanese to hold a foremost place among modern peoples.\r\n\r\nIn the treatment of the difficult Chinese problems Japan has acted in\r\nharmonious concert with the other powers, and her generous cooperation\r\nmaterially aided in the joint relief of the beleaguered legations in Peking\r\nand in bringing about an understanding preliminary to a settlement of the\r\nissues between the powers and China. Japan's declarations in favor of the\r\nintegrity of the Chinese Empire and the conservation of open world trade\r\ntherewith have been frank and positive. As a factor for promoting the\r\ngeneral interests of peace, order, and fair commerce in the Far East the\r\ninfluence of Japan can hardly be overestimated.\r\n\r\nThe valuable aid and kindly courtesies extended by the Japanese Government\r\nand naval officers to the battle ship Oregon are gratefully appreciated.\r\n\r\nComplaint was made last summer of the discriminatory enforcement of a\r\nbubonic quarantine against Japanese on the Pacific coast and of\r\ninterference with their travel in California and Colorado under the health\r\nlaws of those States. The latter restrictions have been adjudged by a\r\nFederal court to be unconstitutional. No recurrence of either cause of\r\ncomplaint is apprehended.\r\n\r\nNo noteworthy incident has occurred in our relations with our important\r\nsouthern neighbor. Commercial intercourse with Mexico continues to thrive,\r\nand the two Governments neglect no opportunity to foster their mutual\r\ninterests in all practicable ways.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the declaration of the Supreme Court that the awards of the\r\nlate joint Commission in the La Abra and Weil claims were obtained through\r\nfraud, the sum awarded in the first case, $403,030.08, has been returned to\r\nMexico, and the amount of the Weil award will be returned in like manner.\r\n\r\nA Convention indefinitely extending the time for the labors of the United\r\nStates and Mexican International (Water) Boundary Commission has been\r\nsigned.\r\n\r\nIt is with satisfaction that I am able to announce the formal notification\r\nat The Hague, on September 4, of the deposit of ratifications of the\r\nConvention for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes by sixteen\r\npowers, namely, the United States, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, England,\r\nFrance, Germany, Italy, Persia, Portugal, Roumania, Russia, Siam, Spain,\r\nSweden and Norway, and the Netherlands. Japan also has since ratified the\r\nConvention.\r\n\r\nThe Administrative Council of the Permanent Court of Arbitration has been\r\norganized and has adopted rules of order and a constitution for the\r\nInternational Arbitration Bureau. In accordance with Article XXIII of the\r\nConvention providing for the appointment by each signatory power of persons\r\nof known competency in questions of international law as arbitrators, I\r\nhave appointed as members of this Court, Hon. Benjamin Harrison, of\r\nIndiana, ex-President of the United States; Hon. Melville W. Fuller, of\r\nIllinois, Chief justice of the United States; Hon. John W. Griggs, of New\r\nJersey, Attorney General of the United States; and Hon. George Gray, of\r\nDelaware, a judge of the circuit court of the United States.\r\n\r\nAs an incident of the brief revolution in the Mosquito district of\r\nNicaragua early in 1899 the insurgents forcibly collected from American\r\nmerchants duties upon imports. On the restoration of order the Nicaraguan\r\nauthorities demanded a second payment of such duties on the ground that\r\nthey were due to the titular Government and that their diversion had aided\r\nthe revolt.\r\n\r\nThis position was not accepted by us. After prolonged discussion a\r\ncompromise was effected under which the amount of the second payments was\r\ndeposited with the British consul at San Juan del Norte in trust until the\r\ntwo Governments should determine whether the first payments had been made\r\nunder compulsion to a de facto authority. Agreement as to this was not\r\nreached, and the point was waived by the act of the Nicaraguan Government\r\nin requesting the British consul to return the deposits to the merchants.\r\n\r\nMenacing differences between several of the Central American States have\r\nbeen accommodated, our ministers rendering good offices toward an\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\nThe all-important matter of an interoceanic canal has assumed a new phase.\r\nAdhering to its refusal to reopen the question of the forfeiture of the\r\ncontract of the Maritime Canal Company, which was terminated for alleged\r\nnonexecution in October, 1899, the Government of Nicaragua has since\r\nsupplemented that action by declaring the so styled Eyre-Cragin option void\r\nfor nonpayment of the stipulated advance. Protests in relation to these\r\nacts have been filed in the State Department and are under consideration.\r\nDeeming itself relieved from existing engagements, the Nicaraguan\r\nGovernment shows a disposition to deal freely with the canal question\r\neither in the way of negotiations with the United States or by taking\r\nmeasures to promote the waterway.\r\n\r\nOvertures for a convention to effect the building of a canal under the\r\nauspices of the United States are under consideration. In the meantime, the\r\nviews of the Congress upon the general subject, in the light of the report\r\nof the Commission appointed to examine the comparative merits of the\r\nvarious trans-Isthmian ship-canal projects, may be awaited.\r\n\r\nI commend to the early attention of the Senate the Convention with Great\r\nBritain to facilitate the construction of such a canal and to remove any\r\nobjection which might arise out of the Convention commonly called the\r\nClayton-Bulwer Treaty.\r\n\r\nThe long-standing contention with Portugal, growing out of the seizure of\r\nthe Delagoa Bay Railway, has been at last determined by a favorable award\r\nof the tribunal of arbitration at Berne, to which it was submitted. The\r\namount of the award, which was deposited in London awaiting arrangements by\r\nthe Governments of the United States and Great Britain for its disposal,\r\nhas recently been paid over to the two Governments.\r\n\r\nA lately signed Convention of Extradition with Peru as amended by the\r\nSenate has been ratified by the Peruvian Congress.\r\n\r\nAnother illustration of the policy of this Government to refer\r\ninternational disputes to impartial arbitration is seen in the agreement\r\nreached with Russia to submit the claims on behalf of American sealing\r\nvessels seized in Bering Sea to determination by Mr. T. M. C. Asser, a\r\ndistinguished statesman and jurist of the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nThanks are due to the Imperial Russian Government for the kindly aid\r\nrendered by its authorities in eastern Siberia to American missionaries\r\nfleeing from Manchuria.\r\n\r\nSatisfactory progress has been made toward the conclusion of a general\r\ntreaty of friendship and intercourse with Spain, in replacement of the old\r\ntreaty, which passed into abeyance by reason of the late war. A new\r\nconvention of extradition is approaching completion, and I should be much\r\npleased were a commercial arrangement to follow. I feel that we should not\r\nsuffer to pass any opportunity to reaffirm the cordial ties that existed\r\nbetween us and Spain from the time of our earliest independence, and to\r\nenhance the mutual benefits of that commercial intercourse which is natural\r\nbetween the two countries.\r\n\r\nBy the terms of the Treaty of Peace the line bounding the ceded Philippine\r\ngroup in the southwest failed to include several small islands lying\r\nwestward of the Sulus, which have always been recognized as under Spanish\r\ncontrol. The occupation of Sibutd and Cagayan Sulu by our naval forces\r\nelicited a claim on the part of Spain, the essential equity of which could\r\nnot be gainsaid. In order to cure the defect of the treaty by removing all\r\npossible ground of future misunderstanding respecting the interpretation of\r\nits third article, I directed the negotiation of a supplementary treaty,\r\nwhich will be forthwith laid before the Senate, whereby Spain quits all\r\ntitle and claim of title to the islands named as well as to any and all\r\nislands belonging to the Philippine Archipelago lying outside the lines\r\ndescribed in said third article, and agrees that all such islands shall be\r\ncomprehended in the cession of the archipelago as fully as if they had been\r\nexpressly included within those lines. In consideration of this cession the\r\nUnited States is to pay to Spain the sum of $100,000.\r\n\r\nA bill is now pending to effect the recommendation made in my last annual\r\nmessage that appropriate legislation be had to carry into execution Article\r\nVII of the Treaty of Peace with Spain, by which the United States assumed\r\nthe payment of certain claims for indemnity of its citizens against Spain.\r\nI ask that action be taken to fulfill this obligation.\r\n\r\nThe King of Sweden and Norway has accepted the joint invitation of the\r\nUnited States, Germany, and Great Britain to arbitrate claims growing out\r\nof losses sustained in the Samoan Islands in the course of military\r\noperations made necessary by the disturbances in 1899.\r\n\r\nOur claims upon the Government of the Sultan for reparation for injuries\r\nsuffered by American citizens in Armenia and elsewhere give promise of\r\nearly and satisfactory settlement. His Majesty's good disposition in this\r\nregard has been evinced by the issuance of an irade for rebuilding the\r\nAmerican college at Harpoot.\r\n\r\nThe failure of action by the Senate at its last session upon the commercial\r\nconventions then submitted for its consideration and approval, although\r\ncaused by the great pressure of other legislative business, has caused much\r\ndisappointment to the agricultural and industrial interests of the country,\r\nwhich hoped to profit by their provisions. The conventional periods for\r\ntheir ratification having expired, it became necessary to sign additional\r\narticles extending the time for that purpose. This was requested on our\r\npart, and the other Governments interested have concurred with the\r\nexception of one convention, in respect to which no formal reply has been\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\nSince my last communication to the Congress on this subject special\r\ncommercial agreements under the third section of the tariff act have been\r\nproclaimed with Portugal, with Italy, and with Germany. Commercial\r\nconventions tinder the general limitations of the fourth section of the\r\nsame act have been concluded with Nicaragua, with Ecuador, with the\r\nDominican Republic, with Great Britain on behalf of the island of Trinidad,\r\nand with Denmark on behalf of the island of St. Croix. These will be early\r\ncommunicated to the Senate. Negotiations with other Governments are in\r\nprogress for the improvement and security of our commercial relations.\r\n\r\nThe policy of reciprocity so manifestly rests upon the principles of\r\ninternational equity and has been so repeatedly approved by the people of\r\nthe United States that there ought to be no hesitation in either branch of\r\nthe Congress in giving to it full effect.\r\n\r\nThis Government desires to preserve the most just and amicable commercial\r\nrelations with all foreign countries, unmoved by the industrial rivalries\r\nnecessarily developed in the expansion of international trade. It is\r\nbelieved that the foreign Governments generally entertain the same purpose,\r\nalthough in some instances there are clamorous demands upon them for\r\nlegislation specifically hostile to American interests. Should these\r\ndemands prevail I shall communicate with the Congress with the view of\r\nadvising such legislation as may be necessary to meet the emergency.\r\n\r\nThe exposition of the resources and products of the Western Hemisphere to\r\nbe held at Buffalo next year promises important results not only for the\r\nUnited States but for the other participating countries. It is gratifying\r\nthat the Latin-American States have evinced the liveliest interest, and the\r\nfact that an International American Congress will be held in the City of\r\nMexico while the exposition is in progress encourages the hope of a larger\r\ndisplay at Buffalo than might otherwise be practicable. The work of\r\npreparing an exhibit of our national resources is making satisfactory\r\nprogress under the direction of different officials of the Federal\r\nGovernment, and the various States of the Union have shown a disposition\r\ntoward the most liberal participation in the enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe Bureau of the American Republics continues to discharge, with the\r\nhappiest results, the important work of promoting cordial relations between\r\nthe United States and the Latin-American countries, all of which are now\r\nactive members of the International Union. The Bureau has been instrumental\r\nin bringing about the agreement for another International American\r\nCongress, which is to meet in the City of Mexico in October, 1901. The\r\nBureau's future for another term of ten years is assured by the\r\ninternational compact, but the congress will doubtless have much to do with\r\nshaping new lines of work and a general policy. Its usefulness to the\r\ninterests of Latin-American trade is widely appreciated and shows a\r\ngratifying development.\r\n\r\nThe practical utility of the consular service in obtaining a wide range of\r\ninformation as to the industries and commerce of other countries and the\r\nopportunities thereby afforded for introducing the sale of our goods have\r\nkept steadily in advance of the notable expansion of our foreign trade, and\r\nabundant evidence has been furnished, both at home and abroad, of the fact\r\nthat the Consular Reports, including many from our diplomatic\r\nrepresentatives, have to a considerable extent pointed out ways and means\r\nof disposing of a great variety of manufactured goods which otherwise might\r\nnot have found sale abroad.\r\n\r\nTestimony of foreign observers to the commercial efficiency of the consular\r\ncorps seems to be conclusive, and our own manufacturers and exporters\r\nhighly appreciate the value of the services rendered not only in the\r\nprinted reports but also in the individual efforts of consular officers to\r\npromote American trade. An increasing part of the work of the Bureau of\r\nForeign Commerce, whose primary duty it is to compile and print the\r\nreports, is to answer inquiries from trade organizations, business houses,\r\netc., as to conditions in various parts of the world, and, notwithstanding\r\nthe smallness of the force employed, the work has been so systematized that\r\nresponses are made with such promptitude and accuracy as to elicit\r\nflattering encomiums. The experiment of printing the Consular Reports daily\r\nfor immediate use by trade bodies, exporters, and the press, which was\r\nbegun in January, 1898, continues to give general satisfaction.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to be able to state that the surplus revenues for the\r\nfiscal year ended June 30, 1900, were $79,527,060.18. For the six preceding\r\nyears we had only deficits, the aggregate of which from 1894 to 1899,\r\ninclusive, amounted to $283,022,991.14. The receipts for the year from all\r\nsources, exclusive of postal revenues, aggregated $567,240,851.89, and\r\nexpenditures for all purposes, except for the administration of the postal\r\ndepartment, aggregated $487,713,791.71. The receipts from customs were\r\n$233,164,871.16, an increase over the preceding year Of $27,036,389.41. The\r\nreceipts from internal revenue were $295,327,926.76, an increase Of\r\n$21,890,765.25 over 1899. The receipts from miscellaneous sources were\r\n$38,748,053.97, as against $36,394,976.92 for the previous year.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying also to note that during the year a considerable reduction\r\nis shown in the expenditures of the Government. The War Department\r\nexpenditures for the fiscal year 1900 were $134,774,767.78, a reduction of\r\n$95,066,486.69 over those of 1899. In the Navy Department the expenditures\r\nwere $55,953,077.72 for the year 1900, as against $63,942,104.25 for the\r\npreceding year, a decrease of $7,989,026.53. In the expenditures on account\r\nof Indians there was a decrease in 1900 over 1899 Of $2,630,604.38; and in\r\nthe civil and miscellaneous expenses for 1900 there was a reduction Of\r\n$13,418,065.74.\r\n\r\nBecause of the excess of revenues over expenditures the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury was enabled to apply bonds and other securities to the sinking\r\nfund to the amount Of $56,544,556.06. The details of the sinking fund are\r\nset forth in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury, to which I invite\r\nattention. The Secretary of the Treasury estimates that the receipts for\r\nthe current fiscal year will aggregate $580,000,000 and the expenditures\r\n$500,000,000, leaving an excess of revenues over expenditures of\r\n$80,000,000. The present condition of the Treasury is one of undoubted\r\nstrength. The available cash balance November 30 was $139,303,794.50. Under\r\nthe form of statement prior to the financial law of March 14 last there\r\nwould have been included in the statement of available cash gold coin and\r\nbullion held for the redemption of United States notes.\r\n\r\nIf this form were pursued, the cash balance including the present gold\r\nreserve of $150,000,000, would be $289,303,794.50. Such balance November\r\n30, 1899, was $296,495,301.55. In the general fund, which is wholly\r\nseparate from the reserve and trust funds, there was on November 30,\r\n$70,090,073.15 in gold coin and bullion, to which should be added\r\n$22,957,300 in gold certificates subject to issue, against which there is\r\nheld in the Division of Redemption gold coin and bullion, making a total\r\nholding of free gold amounting to $93,047,373.15.\r\n\r\nIt will be the duty as I am sure it will be the disposition of the Congress\r\nto provide whatever further legislation is needed to insure the continued\r\nparity under all conditions between our two forms of metallic money, silver\r\nand gold.\r\n\r\nOur surplus revenues have permitted the Secretary of the Treasury since the\r\nclose of the fiscal year to call in the funded loan of 1891 continued at 2\r\nper cent, in the sum of $25,364,500. To and including November 30,\r\n$23,458,100 Of these bonds have been paid. This sum, together with the\r\namount which may accrue from further redemptions under the call, will be\r\napplied to the sinking fund.\r\n\r\nThe law of March 14, 1900, provided for refunding into 2 per cent\r\nthirty-year bonds, payable, principal and interest, in gold coin of the\r\npresent standard value, that portion of the public debt represented by the\r\n3 per cent bonds of 1908, the 4 percents Of 1907, and the 5 percents of\r\n1904, Of which there was outstanding at the date of said law $839,149,930,\r\nThe holders of the old bonds presented them for exchange between March 14\r\nand November 30 to the amount of $364,943,750. The net saving to the\r\nGovernment on these transactions aggregates $9,106,166.\r\n\r\nAnother effect of the operation, as stated by the Secretary, is to reduce\r\nthe charge upon the Treasury for the payment of interest from the dates of\r\nrefunding to February 1, 1904, by the sum of more than seven million\r\ndollars annually. From February 1, 1904, to July 1, 11907, the annual\r\ninterest charge will be reduced by the sum of more than five millions, and\r\nfor the thirteen months ending August 1, 1908, by about one million. The\r\nfull details of the refunding are given in the annual report of the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe beneficial effect of the financial act of 1900, so far as it relates to\r\na modification of the national banking act, is already apparent. The\r\nprovision for the incorporation of national banks with a capital of not\r\nless than $25,000 in places not exceeding three thousand inhabitants has\r\nresulted in the extension of banking facilities to many small communities\r\nhitherto unable to provide themselves with banking institutions under the\r\nnational system. There were organized from the enactment of the law up to\r\nand including November 30, 369 national banks, of which 266 were with\r\ncapital less than $50,000, and 103 with capital of $50,000 or more.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of mention that the greater number of banks being organized\r\nunder the new law are in sections where the need of banking facilities has\r\nbeen most pronounced. Iowa stands first, with 30 banks of the smaller\r\nclass, while Texas, Oklahoma, Indian Territory, and the middle and western\r\nsections of the country have also availed themselves largely of the\r\nprivileges under the new law.\r\n\r\nA large increase in national bank-note circulation has resulted from the\r\nprovision of the act which permits national banks to issue circulating\r\nnotes to the par value of the United States bonds deposited as security\r\ninstead of only go per cent thereof, as heretofore. The increase in\r\ncirculating notes from March 14 to November 30 is $77,889,570.\r\n\r\nThe party in power is committed to such legislation as will better make the\r\ncurrency responsive to the varying needs of business at all seasons and in\r\nall sections.\r\n\r\nOur foreign trade shows a remarkable record of commercial and industrial\r\nprogress. The total of imports and exports for the first time in the\r\nhistory of the country exceeded two billions of dollars. The exports are\r\ngreater than they have ever been before, the total for the fiscal year 1900\r\nbeing $1,394,483,082, an increase over 1899 of $167,459,780, an increase\r\nover 1898 of $163,000,752, over 1897 Of $343,489,526, and greater than 1896\r\nby $511,876,144.\r\n\r\nThe growth of manufactures in the United States is evidenced by the fact\r\nthat exports of manufactured products largely exceed those of any previous\r\nyear, their value for 1900 being $433,851,756, against $339,592,146 in\r\n1899, an increase of 28 per cent.\r\n\r\nAgricultural products were also exported during 1900 in greater volume than\r\nin 1899, the total for the year being $835,858,123, against $784,776,142 in\r\n1899.\r\n\r\nThe imports for the year amounted to $849,941,184, an increase over 1899 of\r\n$152,792,695. This increase is largely in materials for manufacture, and is\r\nin response to the rapid development of manufacturing in the United States.\r\nWhile there was imported for use in manufactures in 1900 material to the\r\nvalue of $79,768,972 in excess of 1899, it is reassuring to observe that\r\nthere is a tendency toward decrease in the importation of articles\r\nmanufactured ready for consumption, which in 1900 formed 15.17 per cent of\r\nthe total imports, against 15.54 per cent in 1899 and 21.09 per cent in\r\n1896.\r\n\r\nI recommend that the Congress at its present session reduce the\r\ninternal-revenue taxes imposed to meet the expenses of the war with Spain.\r\nin the sum of thirty millions of dollars. This reduction should be secured\r\nby the remission of those taxes which experience has shown to be the most\r\nburdensome to the industries of the people.\r\n\r\nI specially urge that there be included in whatever reduction is made the\r\nlegacy tax on bequests for public uses of a literary, educational, or\r\ncharitable character.\r\n\r\nAmerican vessels during the past three years have carried about 9 per cent\r\nof our exports and imports. Foreign ships should carry the least, not the\r\ngreatest, part of American trade. The remarkable growth of our steel\r\nindustries, the progress of shipbuilding for the domestic trade, and our\r\nsteadily maintained expenditures for the Navy have created an opportunity\r\nto place the United States in the first rank of commercial maritime powers.\r\n\r\nBesides realizing a proper national aspiration this will mean the\r\nestablishment and healthy growth along all our coasts of a distinctive\r\nnational industry, expanding the field for the profitable employment of\r\nlabor and capital. It will increase the transportation facilities and\r\nreduce freight charges on the vast volume of products brought from the\r\ninterior to the seaboard for export, and will strengthen an arm of the\r\nnational defense upon which the founders of the Government and their\r\nsuccessors have relied. In again urging immediate action by the Congress on\r\nmeasures to promote American shipping and foreign trade, I direct attention\r\nto the recommendations on the subject in previous messages, and\r\nparticularly to the opinion expressed in the message of 1899: I am\r\nsatisfied the judgment of the country favors the policy of aid to our\r\nmerchant marine, which will broaden our commerce and markets and upbuild\r\nour sea-carrying capacity for the products of agriculture and manufacture,\r\nwhich, with the increase of our Navy, mean more work and wages to our\r\ncountrymen, as well as a safeguard to American interests in every part of\r\nthe world. The attention of the Congress is invited to the recommendation\r\nof the Secretary of the Treasury in his annual report for legislation in\r\nbehalf of the Revenue-Cutter Service, and favorable action is urged.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message to the Congress I called attention to the\r\nnecessity for early action to remedy such evils as might be found to exist\r\nin connection with combinations of capital organized into trusts, and again\r\ninvite attention to my discussion of the subject at that time, which\r\nconcluded with these words: It is apparent that uniformity of legislation\r\nupon this subject in the several States is much to be desired. It is to be\r\nhoped that such uniformity, founded in a wise and just discrimination\r\nbetween what is injurious and what is useful and necessary in business\r\noperations, may be obtained, and that means may be found for the Congress,\r\nwithin the limitations of its constitutional power, so to supplement an\r\neffective code of State legislation as to make a complete system of laws\r\nthroughout the United States adequate to compel a general observance of the\r\nsalutary rules to which I have referred.\r\n\r\nThe whole question is so important and far-reaching that I am sure no part\r\nof it will be lightly considered, but every phase of it will have the\r\nstudied deliberation of the Congress, resulting in wise and judicious\r\naction. Restraint upon such combinations as are injurious, and which are\r\nwithin Federal jurisdiction, should be promptly applied by the Congress.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message I dwelt at some length upon the condition of\r\naffairs in the Philippines. While seeking to impress upon you that the\r\ngrave responsibility of the future government of those islands rests with\r\nthe Congress of the United States, I abstained from recommending at that\r\ntime a specific and final form of government for the territory actually\r\nheld by the United States forces and in which as long as insurrection\r\ncontinues the military arm must necessarily be supreme. I stated my\r\npurpose, until the Congress shall have made the formal expression of its\r\nwill, to use the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the\r\nstatutes to uphold the sovereignty of the United States in those distant\r\nislands as in all other places where our flag rightfully floats, placing,\r\nto that end, at the disposal of the army and navy all the means which the\r\nliberality of the Congress and the people have provided. No contrary\r\nexpression of the will of the Congress having been made, I have steadfastly\r\npursued the purpose so declared, employing the civil arm as well toward the\r\naccomplishment of pacification and the institution of local governments\r\nwithin the lines of authority and law.\r\n\r\nProgress in the hoped-for direction has been favorable. Our forces have\r\nsuccessfully controlled the greater part of the islands, overcoming the\r\norganized forces of the insurgents and carrying order and administrative\r\nregularity to all quarters. What opposition remains is for the most part\r\nscattered, obeying no concerted plan of strategic action, operating only by\r\nthe methods common to the traditions of guerrilla warfare, which, while\r\nineffective to alter the general control now established, are still\r\nsufficient to beget insecurity among the populations that have felt the\r\ngood results of our control and thus delay the conferment upon them of the\r\nfuller measures of local self-government, of education, and of industrial\r\nand agricultural development which we stand ready to give to them.\r\n\r\nBy the spring of this year the effective opposition of the dissatisfied\r\nTagals to the authority of the United States was virtually ended, thus\r\nopening the door for the extension of a stable administration over much of\r\nthe territory of the Archipelago. Desiring to bring this about, I appointed\r\nin March last a civil Commission composed of the Hon. William H. Taft, of\r\nOhio; Prof. Dean C. Worcester, of Michigan; the Hon. Luke I. Wright, of\r\nTennessee; the Hon. Henry C. Ide, of Vermont, and Prof. Bernard Moses, of\r\nCalifornia. The aims of their mission and the scope of their authority are\r\nclearly set forth in my instructions of April 7, 1900, addressed to the\r\nSecretary of War to be transmitted to them:\r\n\r\nIn the message transmitted to the Congress on the 5th of December, 1899, I\r\nsaid, speaking of the Philippine Islands: \"As long as the insurrection\r\ncontinues the military arm must necessarily be supreme. But there is no\r\nreason why steps should not be taken from time to time to inaugurate\r\ngovernments essentially popular in their form as fast as territory is held\r\nand controlled by our troops. To this end I am considering the advisability\r\nof the return of the Commission, or such of the members thereof as can be\r\nsecured, to aid the existing authorities and facilitate this work\r\nthroughout the islands.\"\r\n\r\nTo give effect to the intention thus expressed, I have appointed Hon.\r\nWilliam H. Taft, of Ohio; Prof. Dean C. Worcester, of Michigan; Non. Luke\r\nI. Wright, of Tennessee; Hon. Henry C. Ide, of Vermont, and Prof. Bernard\r\nMoses, of California, Commissioners to the Philippine Islands to continue\r\nand perfect the work of organizing and establishing civil government\r\nalready commenced by the military authorities, subject in all respects to\r\nany laws which Congress may hereafter enact.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners named will meet and act as a board, and the Hon. William\r\nH. Taft t is designated as president of the board. It is probable that the\r\ntransfer of authority from military commanders to civil officers will be\r\ngradual and will occupy a considerable period. Its successful\r\naccomplishment and the maintenance of peace and order in the meantime will\r\nrequire the most perfect co-operation between the civil and military\r\nauthorities in the islands, and both should be directed during the\r\ntransition period by the same Executive Department. The Commission will\r\ntherefore report to the Secretary of War, and all their action will be\r\nsubject to your approval and control.\r\n\r\nYou will instruct the Commission to proceed to the city of Manila, where\r\nthey will make their principal office, and to communicate with the Military\r\nGovernor of the Philippine Islands, whom you will at the same time direct\r\nto render to them every assistance within his power in the performance of\r\ntheir duties. Without hampering them by too specific instructions, they\r\nshould in general be enjoined, after making themselves familiar with the\r\nconditions and needs of the country, to devote their attention in the first\r\ninstance to the establishment of municipal governments, in which the\r\nnatives of the islands, both in the cities and in the rural communities,\r\nshall be afforded the opportunity to manage their own local affairs to the\r\nfullest extent of which they are capable and subject to the least degree of\r\nsupervision and control which a careful study of their capacities and\r\nobservation of the workings of native control show to be consistent with\r\nthe maintenance of law, order, and loyalty.\r\n\r\nThe next subject in order of importance should be the organization of\r\ngovernment in the larger administrative divisions corresponding to\r\ncounties, departments, or provinces, in which the common interests of many\r\nor several municipalities falling within the same tribal lines, or the same\r\nnatural geographical limits, may best be subserved by a common\r\nadministration. Whenever the Commission is of the opinion that the\r\ncondition of affairs in the islands is such that the central administration\r\nmay safely be transferred from military to civil control they will report\r\nthat conclusion to you, with their recommendations as to the form of\r\ncentral government to be established for the purpose of taking over the\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nBeginning with the 1st day of September, 1900, the authority to exercise,\r\nsubject to my approval, through the Secretary of War, that part of the\r\npower of government in the Philippine Islands which is of a legislative\r\nnature is to be transferred from the Military Governor of the islands to\r\nthis Commission, to be thereafter exercised by them in the place and stead\r\nof the Military Governor, under such rules and regulations as you shall\r\nprescribe, until the establishment of the civil central government for the\r\nislands contemplated in the last foregoing paragraph, or until Congress\r\nshall otherwise provide. Exercise of this legislative authority will\r\ninclude the making of rules and orders, having the effect of law, for the\r\nraising of revenue by taxes, customs duties, and imposts; the appropriation\r\nand expenditure of public funds of the islands; the establishment of an\r\neducational system throughout the islands; the establishment of a system\r\nto secure an efficient civil service; the organization and establishment of\r\ncourts; the organization and establishment of municipal and departmental\r\ngovernments, and all other matters of a civil nature for which the Military\r\nGovernor is now competent to provide by rules or orders of a legislative\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nThe Commission will also have power during the same period to appoint to\r\noffice such officers under the judicial, educational, and civil-service\r\nsystems and in the municipal and departmental governments as shall be\r\nprovided for. Until the complete transfer of control the Military Governor\r\nwill remain the chief executive head of the government of the islands, and\r\nwill exercise the executive authority now possessed by him and not herein\r\nexpressly assigned to the Commission, subject, however, to the rules and\r\norders enacted by the Commission in the exercise of the legislative powers\r\nconferred upon them. In the meantime the municipal and departmental\r\ngovernments will continue to report to the Military Governor and be subject\r\nto his administrative supervision and control, under your direction, but\r\nthat supervision and control will be confined within the narrowest limits\r\nconsistent with the requirement that the powers of government in the\r\nmunicipalities and departments shall be honestly and effectively exercised\r\nand that law and order and individual freedom shall be maintained.\r\n\r\nAll legislative rules and orders, establishments of government, and\r\nappointments to office by the Commission will take effect immediately, or\r\nat such times as they shall designate, subject to your approval and action\r\nupon the coming in of the Commission's reports, which are to be made from\r\ntime to time as their action is taken. Wherever civil governments are\r\nconstituted under the direction of the Commission such military posts,\r\ngarrisons, and forces will be continued for the suppression of insurrection\r\nand brigandage and the maintenance of law and order as the Military\r\nCommander shall deem requisite, and the military forces shall be at all\r\ntimes subject, under his orders, to the call of the civil authorities for\r\nthe maintenance of law and order and the enforcement of their authority.\r\n\r\nIn the establishment of municipal governments the Commission will take as\r\nthe basis of their work the governments established by the Military\r\nGovernor under his order of August 8, 1899. and under the report of the\r\nboard constituted by the Military Governor by his order of January 29,\r\n1900, to formulate and report a plan of municipal government, of which His\r\nHonor Cayetano Arellano, President of the Audiencia, was chairman, and they\r\nwill give to the conclusions of that board the weight and consideration\r\nwhich the high character and distinguished abilities of its members\r\njustify.\r\n\r\nIn the constitution of departmental or provincial governments they will\r\ngive especial attention to the existing government of the island of Negros,\r\nconstituted, with the approval of the people of that island, under the\r\norder of the Military Governor of July 22, 1899, and after verifying, so\r\nfar as may be practicable, the reports of the successful working of that\r\ngovernment they will be guided by the experience thus acquired so far as it\r\nmay be applicable to the condition existing in other portions of the\r\nPhilippines. They will avail themselves, to the fullest degree practicable,\r\nof the conclusions reached by the previous Commission to the Philippines.\r\n\r\nIn the distribution of powers among the governments organized by the\r\nCommission, the presumption is always to be in favor of the smaller\r\nsubdivision, so that all the powers which can properly be exercised by the\r\nmunicipal government shall be vested in that government, and all the powers\r\nof a more general character which can be exercised by the departmental\r\ngovernment shall be vested in that government, and so that in the\r\ngovernmental system, which is the result of the process, the central\r\ngovernment of the islands, following the example of the distribution of the\r\npowers between the States and the National Government of the United States,\r\nshall have no direct administration except of matters of purely general\r\nconcern, and shall have only such supervision and control over local\r\ngovernments as may be necessary to secure and enforce faithful and\r\nefficient administration by local officers.\r\n\r\nThe many Different degrees of civilization and varieties of custom and\r\ncapacity among the people of the different islands preclude very definite\r\ninstruction as to the part which the people shall take in the selection of\r\ntheir own officers; but these general rules are to be observed: That in all\r\ncases the municipal officers, who administer the local affairs of the\r\npeople, are to be selected by the people, and that wherever officers of\r\nmore extended jurisdiction are to be selected in any way, natives of the\r\nislands are to be preferred, and if they can be found competent and willing\r\nto perform the duties, they are to receive the offices in preference to any\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nIt will be necessary to fill some offices for the present with Americans\r\nwhich after a time may well be filled by natives of the islands. As soon as\r\npracticable a system for ascertaining the merit and fitness of candidates\r\nfor civil office should be put in force. An indispensable qualification for\r\nall offices and positions of trust and authority in the islands must be\r\nabsolute and unconditional loyalty to the United States, and absolute and\r\nunhampered authority and power to remove and punish any officer deviating\r\nfrom that standard must at all times be retained in the hands of the\r\ncentral authority of the islands.\r\n\r\nIn all the forms of government and administrative provisions which they are\r\nauthorized to prescribe the Commission should bear in mind that the\r\ngovernment which they are establishing is designed not for our\r\nsatisfaction, or for the expression of our theoretical views, but for the\r\nhappiness, peace, and prosperity of the people of the Philippine Islands,\r\nand the measures adopted should be made to conform to their customs, their\r\nhabits, and even heir prejudices, to the fullest extent consistent with the\r\naccomplishment of the Indispensable requisites of just and effective\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the Commission should bear in mind, and the people of the\r\nislands should be made plainly to understand, that there are certain great\r\nprinciples of government which have been made the basis of our governmental\r\nsystem which we deem essential to the rule of law and the maintenance of\r\nindividual freedom, and of which they have, unfortunately, been denied the\r\nexperience possessed by us; that there are also certain practical rules of\r\ngovernment which we have found to be essential to the preservation of these\r\ngreat principles of liberty and law, and that these principles and these\r\nrules of government must be established and maintained in their islands for\r\nthe sake of their liberty and happiness, however much they may conflict\r\nwith the customs or laws of procedure with which they are familiar.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the most enlightened thought of the Philippine Islands\r\nfully appreciates the importance of these principles and rules, and they\r\nwill inevitably within a short time command universal assent. Upon every\r\ndivision and branch of the government of the Philippines, therefore, must\r\nbe imposed these inviolable rules:\r\n\r\nThat no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due\r\nprocess of law; that private property shall not be taken for public use\r\nwithout just compensation; that in all criminal prosecutions the accused\r\nshall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, to be informed of the\r\nnature and cause of the accusation, to be confronted with the witnesses\r\nagainst him, to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his\r\nfavor, and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense; that\r\nexcessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor\r\ncruel and unusual punishment inflicted; that no person shall be put twice\r\nin jeopardy for the same offense, or be compelled in any criminal case to\r\nbe a witness against himself; that the right to be secure against\r\nunreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated; that neither\r\nslavery nor involuntary servitude shall exist except as a punishment for\r\ncrime; that no bill of attainder or ex-post facto law shall be passed; that\r\nno law shall be passed abridging the freedom of speech or of the press, or\r\nthe rights of the people to peaceably assemble and petition the Government\r\nfor a redress of grievances; that no law shall be made respecting an\r\nestablishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, and\r\nthat the free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship\r\nwithout discrimination or preference shall forever be allowed.\r\n\r\nIt will be the duty of the Commission to make a thorough investigation into\r\nthe titles to the large tracts of land held or claimed by individuals or by\r\nreligious orders; into the justice of the claims and complaints made\r\nagainst such landholders by the people of the island or any part of the\r\npeople, and to seek by wise and peaceable measures a just settlement of the\r\ncontroversies and redress of wrongs which have caused strife and bloodshed\r\nin the past. In the performance of this duty the Commission is enjoined to\r\nsee that no injustice is done; to have regard for substantial rights and\r\nequity, disregarding technicalities so far as substantial right permits,\r\nand to observe the following rules:\r\n\r\nThat the provision of the Treaty of Paris pledging the United States to the\r\nprotection of all rights of property in the islands, and as well the\r\nprinciple of our own Government which prohibits the taking of private\r\nproperty without due process of law, shall not be violated; that the\r\nwelfare of the people of the islands, which should be a paramount\r\nconsideration, shall be attained consistently with this rule of property\r\nright; that if it becomes necessary for the public interest of the people\r\nof the islands to dispose of claims to property which the Commission finds\r\nto be not lawfully acquired and held disposition shall be made thereof by\r\ndue legal procedure, in which there shall be full opportunity for fair and\r\nimpartial hearing and judgment; that if the same public interests require\r\nthe extinguishment of property rights lawfully acquired and held due\r\ncompensation shall be made out of the public treasury therefore; that no\r\nform of religion and no minister of religion shall be forced upon any\r\ncommunity or upon any citizen of the islands; that, upon the other hand, no\r\nminister of religion shall be interfered with or molested in following his\r\ncalling, and that the separation between State and Church shall be real,\r\nentire, and absolute.\r\n\r\nIt will be the duty of the Commission to promote and extend, and, as they\r\nfind occasion, to improve the system of education already inaugurated by\r\nthe military authorities. In doing this they should regard as of first\r\nimportance the extension of a system of primary education which shall be\r\nfree to all, and which shall tend to fit the people for the duties of\r\ncitizenship and for the ordinary avocations of a civilized community. This\r\ninstruction should be given in the first instance in every part of the\r\nislands in the language of the people. In view of the great number of\r\nlanguages spoken by the different tribes, it is especially important to the\r\nprosperity of the islands that a common medium of communication may be\r\nestablished, and it is obviously desirable that this medium should be the\r\nEnglish language. Especial attention should be at once given to affording\r\nfull opportunity to all the people of the islands to acquire the use of the\r\nEnglish language.\r\n\r\nIt may be well that the main changes which should be made in the system of\r\ntaxation and in the body of the laws under which the people are governed,\r\nexcept such changes as have already been made by the military government,\r\nshould be relegated to the civil government which is to be established\r\nunder the auspices of the Commission. It will, however, be the duty of the\r\nCommission to inquire diligently as to whether there are any further\r\nchanges which ought not to be delayed, and if so, they are authorized to\r\nmake such changes subject to your approval. In doing so they are to bear in\r\nmind that taxes which tend 6 penalize or repress industry and enterprise\r\nare to be avoided; that provisions for taxation should be simple, so that\r\nthey may be understood by the people; that they should affect the fewest\r\npracticable subjects of taxation which will serve for the general\r\ndistribution of the burden.\r\n\r\nThe main body of the laws which regulate the rights and obligations of the\r\npeople should be maintained with as little interference as possible.\r\nChanges made should be mainly in procedure, and in the criminal laws to\r\nsecure speedy and impartial trials, and at the same time effective\r\nadministration and respect for individual rights.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the uncivilized tribes of the islands the Commission should\r\nadopt the same course followed by Congress in permitting the tribes of our\r\nNorth American Indians to maintain their tribal organization and\r\ngovernment, and under which many of those tribes are now living in peace\r\nand contentment, surrounded by a civilization to which they are unable or\r\nunwilling to conform. Such tribal governments should, however, be subjected\r\nto wise and firm regulation, and, without undue or petty interference,\r\nconstant and active effort should be exercised to prevent barbarous\r\npractices and introduce civilized customs.\r\n\r\nUpon all officers and employees of the United States, both civil and\r\nmilitary, should be impressed a sense of the duty to observe not merely the\r\nmaterial but the personal and social rights of the people of the islands,\r\nand to treat them with the same courtesy and respect for their personal\r\ndignity which the people of the United States are accustomed W require from\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nThe articles of capitulation of the city of Manila on the 13th of August,\r\n1898, concluded with these words:\r\n\r\n\"This city, its inhabitants, its churches and religious worship, its\r\neducational establishments, and its private property of all descriptions,\r\nare placed under the special safeguard of the faith and honor of the\r\nAmerican Army.\"\r\n\r\nI believe that this pledge has been faithfully kept. As high and sacred an\r\nobligation rests upon the Government of the United States to give\r\nprotection for property and life, civil and religious freedom, and wise,\r\nfirm, and unselfish guidance in the paths of peace and prosperity to all\r\nthe people of the Philippine Islands. I charge this Commission to labor for\r\nthe full performance of this obligation, which concerns the honor and\r\nconscience of their country, in the firm hope that through their labors all\r\nthe inhabitants of the Philippine Islands may come to look back with\r\ngratitude to the day when God gave victory to American arms at Manila and\r\nset their land under the sovereignty and the protection of the people of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nCoincidently with the entrance of the Commission upon its labors I caused\r\nto be issued by General MacArthur, the Military Governor of the\r\nPhilippines, on June 21, 1900, a proclamation of amnesty in generous terms,\r\nof which many of the insurgents took advantage, among them a number of\r\nimportant leaders.\r\n\r\nThis Commission, composed of eminent citizens representing the diverse\r\ngeographical and political interests of the country, and bringing to their\r\ntask the ripe fruits of long and intelligent service in educational,\r\nadministrative, and judicial careers, made great progress from the outset.\r\nAs early as August 21, 1900, it submitted a preliminary report, which will\r\nbe laid before the Congress, and from which it appears that already the\r\ngood effects of returning order are felt; that business, interrupted by\r\nhostilities, is improving as peace extends; that a larger area is under\r\nsugar cultivation than ever before; that the customs revenues are greater\r\nthan at any time during the Spanish rule; that economy and efficiency in\r\nthe military administration have created a surplus fund of $6,000,000,\r\navailable for needed public improvements; that a stringent civil-service\r\nlaw is in preparation; that railroad communications are expanding, opening\r\nup rich districts, and that a comprehensive scheme of education is being\r\norganized.\r\n\r\nLater reports from the Commission show yet more encouraging advance toward\r\ninsuring the benefits of liberty and good government to the Filipinos, in\r\nthe interest of humanity and with the aim of building up an enduring,\r\nself-supporting, and self-administering community in those far eastern\r\nseas. I would impress upon the Congress that whatever legislation may be\r\nenacted in respect to the Philippine Islands should be along these generous\r\nlines. The fortune of war has thrown upon this nation an unsought trust\r\nwhich should be unselfishly discharged, and devolved upon this Government a\r\nmoral as well as material responsibility toward these millions whom we have\r\nfreed from an oppressive yoke.\r\n\r\nI have on another occasion called the Filipinos the wards of the nation.\r\nOur obligation as guardian was not lightly assumed; it must not be\r\notherwise than honestly fulfilled, aiming first of all to benefit those who\r\nhave come under our fostering care. It is our duty so to treat them that\r\nour flag may be no less beloved in the mountains of Luzon and the fertile\r\nzones of Mindanao and Negros than it is at home, that there as here it\r\nshall be the revered symbol of liberty, enlightenment, and progress in\r\nevery avenue of development.\r\n\r\nThe Filipinos are a race quick to learn and to profit by knowledge He would\r\nbe rash who, with the teachings of contemporaneous history in view, would\r\nfix a limit to the degree of culture and advancement yet within the reach\r\nof these people if our duty toward them be faithfully performed.\r\n\r\nThe civil government of Puerto Rico provided for by the act of the Congress\r\napproved April 12, 1900 is in successful operation The courts have been\r\nestablished. The Governor and his associates, working intelligently and\r\nharmoniously, are meeting with Commendable success.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of November a general election was held in the island for\r\nmembers of the Legislature, and the body elected has been called to convene\r\non the first Monday of December.\r\n\r\nI recommend that legislation be enacted by the Congress conferring upon the\r\nSecretary of the Interior supervision over the public lands in Puerto Rico,\r\nand that he be directed to ascertain the location and quantity of lands the\r\ntitle to which remained in the Crown of Spain at the date of cession of\r\nPuerto Rico to the United States, and that appropriations necessary for\r\nsurveys be made, and that the methods of the disposition of such lands be\r\nprescribed by law.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of July, 1900, I directed that a call be issued for an election\r\nin Cuba for members of a constitutional convention to frame a constitution\r\nas a basis for a stable and independent government in the island. In\r\npursuance thereof the Military Governor issued the following instructions:\r\nWhereas the Congress of the United States, by its joint resolution of April\r\n20, 1898, declared:\r\n\r\n\"That the people of the island of Cuba are, and of right ought to be, free\r\nand independent.\r\n\r\n\"That the United States hereby disclaims any disposition or intention to\r\nexercise sovereignty, jurisdiction, or control over said island except for\r\nthe pacification thereof, and asserts its determination, when that is\r\naccomplished, to leave the government and control of the island to its\r\npeople;\"\r\n\r\nAnd whereas, the people of Cuba have established municipal governments,\r\nderiving their authority from the suffrages of the people given under just\r\nand equal laws, and are now ready, in like manner, to proceed to the\r\nestablishment of a general government which shall assume and exercise\r\nsovereignty, jurisdiction, and control over the island:\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is ordered that a general election be held in the island of\r\nCuba on the third Saturday of September, in the year nineteen hundred, to\r\nelect delegates to a convention to meet in the city of Havana at twelve\r\no'clock noon on the first Monday of November, in the year nineteen hundred,\r\nto frame and adopt a constitution for the people of Cuba, and as a part\r\nthereof to provide for and agree with the Government of the United States\r\nupon the relations to exist between that Government and the Government of\r\nCuba, and to provide for the election by the people of officers under such\r\nconstitution and the transfer of government to the officers so elected.\r\n\r\nThe election will be held in the several voting precincts of the island\r\nunder, and pursuant to, the provisions of the electoral law of April 18,\r\n1900, and the amendments thereof. The election was held on the 15th of\r\nSeptember, and the convention assembled on the 5th of November, 1900, and\r\nis now in session.\r\n\r\nIn calling the convention to order, the Military Governor of Cuba made the\r\nfollowing statement: As Military Governor of the island, representing the\r\nPresident of the United States, I call this convention to order.\r\n\r\nIt will be your duty, first, to frame and adopt a constitution for Cuba,\r\nand when that has been done to formulate what in your opinion ought to be\r\nthe relations between Cuba and the United States.\r\n\r\nThe constitution must be adequate to secure a stable, orderly, and free\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nWhen you have formulated the relations which in your opinion ought to exist\r\nbetween Cuba and the United States the Government of the United States will\r\ndoubtless take such action on its part as shall lead to a final and\r\nauthoritative agreement between the people of the two countries to the\r\npromotion of their common interests.\r\n\r\nAll friends of Cuba will follow your deliberations with the deepest\r\ninterest, earnestly desiring that you shall reach just conclusions, and\r\nthat by the dignity, individual self-restraint, and wise conservatism which\r\nshall characterize your proceedings the capacity of the Cuban people for\r\nrepresentative government may be signally illustrated.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental distinction between true representative government and\r\ndictatorship is that in the former every representative of the people, in\r\nwhatever office, confines himself strictly within the limits of his defined\r\npowers. Without such restraint there can be no free constitutional\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nUnder the order pursuant to which you have been elected and convened you\r\nhave no duty and no authority to take part in the present government of the\r\nisland. Your powers are strictly limited by the terms of that order. When\r\nthe convention concludes its labors I will transmit to the Congress the\r\nconstitution as framed by the convention for its consideration and for such\r\naction as it may deem advisable.\r\n\r\nI renew the recommendation made in my special message of February 10, 1899,\r\nas to the necessity for cable communication between the United States and\r\nHawaii, with extension to Manila. Since then circumstances have strikingly\r\nemphasized this need. Surveys have shown the entire feasibility of a chain\r\nof cables which at each stopping place shall touch on American territory,\r\nso that the system shall be under our own complete control. Manila once\r\nwithin telegraphic reach, connection with the systems of the Asiatic coast\r\nwould open increased and profitable opportunities for a more direct cable\r\nroute from our shores to the Orient than is now afforded by the\r\ntrans-Atlantic, continental, and trans-Asian lines. I urge attention to\r\nthis important matter.\r\n\r\nThe present strength of the Army is 100,000 men--65,000 regulars and\r\n35,000 volunteers. Under the act of March 2, 1899, on the 30th of June next\r\nthe present volunteer force will be discharged and the Regular Army will be\r\nreduced to 2,447 officers and 29,025 enlisted men.\r\n\r\nIn 1888 a Board of Officers convened by President Cleveland adopted a\r\ncomprehensive scheme of coast-defense fortifications which involved the\r\noutlay of something over one hundred million dollars. This plan received\r\nthe approval of the Congress, and since then regular appropriations have\r\nbeen made and the work of fortification has steadily progressed.\r\n\r\nMore than sixty millions of dollars have been invested in a great number of\r\nforts and guns, with all the complicated and scientific machinery and\r\nelectrical appliances necessary for their use. The proper care of this\r\ndefensive machinery requires men trained in its use. The number of men\r\nnecessary to perform this duty alone is ascertained by the War Department,\r\nat a minimum allowance, to be 18,420.\r\n\r\nThere are fifty-eight or more military posts in the United States other\r\nthan the coast-defense fortifications.\r\n\r\nThe number of these posts is being constantly increased by the Congress.\r\nMore than $22,000,000 have been expended in building and equipment, and\r\nthey can only be cared for by the Regular Army. The posts now in existence\r\nand others to be built provide for accommodations for, and if fully\r\ngarrisoned require, 26,000 troops. Many of these posts are along our\r\nfrontier or at important strategic points, the occupation of which is\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nWe have in Cuba between 5,000 and 6,000 troops. For the present our troops\r\nin that island cannot be withdrawn or materially diminished, and certainly\r\nnot until the conclusion of the labors of the constitutional convention now\r\nin session and a government provided by the new constitution shall have\r\nbeen established and its stability assured.\r\n\r\nIn Puerto Rico we have reduced the garrisons to 1,636, which includes 879\r\nnative troops. There is no room for further reduction here.\r\n\r\nWe will be required to keep a considerable force in the Philippine Islands\r\nfor some time to come. From the best information obtainable we will need\r\nthere for the immediate future from 45,000 to 60,000 men. I am sure the\r\nnumber may be reduced as the insurgents shall come to acknowledge the\r\nauthority of the United States, of which there are assuring indications.\r\n\r\nIt must be apparent that we will require an army of about 60,000, and that\r\nduring present conditions in Cuba and the Philippines the President should\r\nhave authority to increase the force to the present number of 100,000.\r\nIncluded in this number authority should be given to raise native troops in\r\nthe Philippines up to 15,000, which the Taft Commission believe will be\r\nmore effective in detecting and suppressing guerrillas, assassins, and\r\nladrones than our own soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe full discussion of this subject by the Secretary of War in his annual\r\nreport is called to your earnest attention.\r\n\r\nI renew the recommendation made in my last annual message that the Congress\r\nprovide a special medal of honor for the volunteers, regulars, sailors, and\r\nmarines on duty in the Philippines who voluntarily remained in the service\r\nafter their terms of enlistment had expired.\r\n\r\nI favor the recommendation of the Secretary of War for the detail oil\r\nofficers from the line of the Army when vacancies occur in the\r\nAdjutant-General's Department, Inspector-General's Department,\r\nQuartermaster's Department, Subsistence Department, Pay Department,\r\nOrdnance Department, and Signal Corps.\r\n\r\nThe Army cannot be too highly commended for its faithful and effective\r\nservice in active military operations in the field and the difficult work\r\nof civil administration.\r\n\r\nThe continued and rapid growth of the postal service is a sure index of the\r\ngreat and increasing business activity of the country. Its most striking\r\nnew development is the extension of rural free delivery. This has come\r\nalmost wholly within the last year. At the beginning of the fiscal year\r\n1899, 1900 the number of routes in operation was only 391, and most of\r\nthese had been running less than twelve months. On the 15th of November,\r\n1900, the number had increased to 2,614, reaching into forty-four States\r\nand Territories, and serving a population of 1,801,524. The number of\r\napplications now pending and awaiting action nearly equals all those\r\ngranted up to the present time, and by the close of the current fiscal year\r\nabout 4,000 routes will have been established, providing for the daily\r\ndelivery of mails at the scattered homes of about three and a half millions\r\nof rural population.\r\n\r\nThis service ameliorates the isolation of farm life, conduces to good\r\nroads, and quickens and extends the dissemination of general information.\r\nExperience thus far has tended to allay the apprehension that it would be\r\nso expensive as to forbid its general adoption or make it a serious burden.\r\nIts actual application has shown that it increases postal receipts, and can\r\nbe accompanied by reductions in other branches of the service, so that the\r\naugmented revenues and the accomplished savings together materially reduce\r\nthe net cost. The evidences which point to these conclusions are presented\r\nin detail in the annual report of the Postmaster-General, which with its\r\nrecommendations is commended to the consideration of the Congress. The full\r\ndevelopment of this special service, however, requires such a large outlay\r\nof money that it should be undertaken only after a careful study and\r\nthorough understanding of all that it involves.\r\n\r\nVery efficient service has been rendered by the Navy in connection with the\r\ninsurrection in the Philippines and the recent disturbance in China.\r\n\r\nA very satisfactory settlement has been made of the long-pending question\r\nof the manufacture of armor plate. A reasonable price has been secured and\r\nthe necessity for a Government armor plant avoided.\r\n\r\nI approve of the recommendations of the Secretary for new vessels and for\r\nadditional officers and men which the required increase of the Navy makes\r\nnecessary. I commend to the favorable action of the Congress the measure\r\nnow pending for the erection of a statue to the memory of the late Admiral\r\nDavid D. Porter. I commend also the establishment of a national naval\r\nreserve and of the grade of vice-admiral. Provision should be made, as\r\nrecommended by the Secretary, for suitable rewards for special merit. Many\r\nofficers who rendered the most distinguished service during the recent war\r\nwith Spain have received in return no recognition from the Congress.\r\n\r\nThe total area of public lands as given by the Secretary of the Interior is\r\napproximately 1,071,881,662 acres, of which 917,135,880 acres are\r\nundisposed of and 154,745,782 acres have been reserved for various\r\npurposes. The public lands disposed of during the year amount to\r\n13,453,887.96 acres, including 62,423.09 acres of Indian lands, an increase\r\nOf 4,271,474.80 over the preceding year. The total receipts from the sale\r\nof public lands during the fiscal year were $4,379,758.10, an increase of\r\n$1,309,620.76 over the preceding year.\r\n\r\nThe results obtained from our forest policy have demonstrated its wisdom\r\nand the necessity in the interest of the public for its continuance and\r\nincreased appropriations by the Congress for the carrying on of the work.\r\nOn June 30, 1900, there were thirty-seven forest reserves, created by\r\nPresidential proclamations under section 24 Of the act of March 3, 1891,\r\nembracing an area Of 46,425,529 acres.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year the Olympic Reserve, in the State of Washington, was\r\nreduced 265,040 acres, leaving its present area at 1,923,840 acres. The\r\nPrescott Reserve, in Arizona, was increased from 10,240 acres to 423,680\r\nacres, and the Big Horn Reserve, in Wyoming, was increased from 1,127,680\r\nacres to 1,180,800 acres. A new reserve; the Santa Ynez, in California,\r\nembracing an area of 145,000 acres, was created during this year. On\r\nOctober 10, 1900, the Crow Creek Forest Reserve, in Wyoming, was created,\r\nwith an area of 56,320 acres.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the fiscal year there were on the pension roll 993,529 names,\r\na net increase Of 2,010 over the fiscal year 1899. The number added to the\r\nrolls during the year was 45,344. The amount disbursed for Army pensions\r\nduring the year was $134,700,597.24 and for Navy pensions $3,761,533.41, a\r\ntotal of $138,462,130.65, leaving an unexpended balance of $5,542,768.25 to\r\nbe covered into the Treasury, which shows an increase over the previous\r\nyear's expenditure Of $107,077.70. There were 684 names added to the rolls\r\nduring the year by special acts passed at the first session of the\r\nFifty-sixth Congress.\r\n\r\nThe act of May 9, 1900, among other things provides for an extension of\r\nincome to widows pensioned under said act to $250 per annum. The Secretary\r\nof the Interior believes that by the operations of this act the number of\r\npersons pensioned under it will increase and the increased annual payment\r\nfor pensions will be between $3,000,000 and $4,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe Government justly appreciates the services of its soldiers and sailors\r\nby making pension payments liberal beyond precedent to them, their widows\r\nand orphans.\r\n\r\nThere were 26,540 letters patent granted, including reissues and designs,\r\nduring the fiscal year ended June 30, 1900; 1,660 trademarks, 682 labels,\r\nand 93 prints registered. The number of patents which expired was 19,988.\r\nThe total receipts for patents were $1,358,228.35. The expenditures were\r\n$1,247,827.58, showing a surplus Of $110,400.77\r\n\r\nThe attention of the Congress is called to the report of the Secretary of\r\nthe Interior touching the necessity for the further establishment of\r\nschools in the Territory of Alaska, and favorable action is invited\r\nthereon.\r\n\r\nMuch interesting information is given in the report of the Governor of\r\nHawaii as to the progress and development of the islands during the period\r\nfrom July 7, 1898, the date of the approval of the joint resolution of the\r\nCongress providing for their annexation, up to April 30, 1900, the date of\r\nthe approval of the act providing a government for the Territory, and\r\nthereafter.\r\n\r\nThe last Hawaiian census, taken in the year 1896, gives a total population\r\nof 109,020, Of Which 31,019 were native Hawaiians. The number of Americans\r\nreported was 8,485. The results of the Federal census, taken this year,\r\nshow the islands to have a total population Of 154,001, showing an increase\r\nover that reported in 1896 of 44,981, or 41.2 per cent.\r\n\r\nThere has been marked progress in the educational, agricultural, and\r\nrailroad development of the islands.\r\n\r\nIn the Territorial act of April 30, 1900, section 7 of said act repeals\r\nChapter 34 Of the Civil Laws of Hawaii whereby the Government was to assist\r\nin encouraging and developing the agricultural resources of the Republic,\r\nespecially irrigation. The Governor of Hawaii recommends legislation\r\nlooking to the development of such water supply as may exist on the public\r\nlands, with a view of promoting land settlement. The earnest consideration\r\nof the Congress is invited to this important recommendation and others, as\r\nembodied in the report of the Secretary of the Interior.\r\n\r\nThe Director of the Census states that the work in connection with the\r\nTwelfth Census is progressing favorably. This national undertaking, ordered\r\nby the Congress each decade, has finally resulted in the collection of an\r\naggregation of statistical facts to determine the industrial growth of the\r\ncountry, its manufacturing and mechanical resources, its richness in mines\r\nand forests, the number of its agriculturists, their farms and products,\r\nits educational and religious opportunities, as well as questions\r\npertaining to sociological conditions.\r\n\r\nThe labors of the officials in charge of the Bureau indicate that the four\r\nimportant and most desired subjects, namely, population, agricultural,\r\nmanufacturing, and vital statistics, will be completed within the limit\r\nprescribed by the law of March 3, 1899.\r\n\r\nThe field work incident to the above inquiries is now practically finished,\r\nand as a result the population of the States and Territories, including the\r\nHawaiian Islands and Alaska, has been announced. The growth of population\r\nduring the last decade amounts to over 13,000,000, a greater numerical\r\nincrease than in any previous census in the history of the country.\r\n\r\nBulletins will be issued as rapidly as possible giving the population by\r\nStates and Territories, by minor civil divisions. Several announcements of\r\nthis kind have already been made, and it is hoped that the list will be\r\ncompleted by January 1. Other bulletins giving the results of the\r\nmanufacturing and agricultural inquiries will be given to the public as\r\nrapidly as circumstances will admit.\r\n\r\nThe Director, while confident of his ability to complete the different\r\nbranches of the undertaking in the allotted time, finds himself embarrassed\r\nby the lack of a trained force properly equipped for statistical work, thus\r\nraising the question whether in the interest of economy and a thorough\r\nexecution of the census work there should not be retained in the Government\r\nemploy a certain number of experts not only to aid in the preliminary\r\norganization prior to the taking of the decennial census, but in addition\r\nto have the advantage in the field and office work of the Bureau of trained\r\nassistants to facilitate the early completion of this enormous\r\nundertaking.\r\n\r\nI recommend that the Congress at its present session apportion\r\nrepresentation among the several States as provided by the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Agriculture has been extending its work during the past\r\nyear, reaching farther for new varieties of seeds and plants; co-operating\r\nmore fully with the States and Territories in research along useful lines;\r\nmaking progress in meteorological work relating to lines of wireless\r\ntelegraphy and forecasts for ocean-going vessels; continuing inquiry as to\r\nanimal disease; looking into the extent and character of food adulteration;\r\noutlining plans for the care, preservation, and intelligent harvesting of\r\nour woodlands; studying soils that producers may cultivate with better\r\nknowledge of conditions, and helping to clothe desert places with grasses\r\nsuitable to our and regions. Our island possessions are being considered\r\nthat their peoples may be helped to produce the tropical products now so\r\nextensively brought into the United States. Inquiry into methods of\r\nimproving our roads has been active during the year; help has been given to\r\nmany localities, and scientific investigation of material in the States and\r\nTerritories has been inaugurated. Irrigation problems in our semiarid\r\nregions are receiving careful and increased consideration.\r\n\r\nAn extensive exhibit at Paris of the products of agriculture has made the\r\npeoples of many countries more familiar with the varied products of our\r\nfields and their comparative excellence.\r\n\r\nThe collection of statistics regarding our crops is being improved and\r\nsources of information are being enlarged, to the end that producers may\r\nhave the earliest advices regarding crop conditions. There has never been a\r\ntime when those for whom it was established have shown more appreciation of\r\nthe services of the Department.\r\n\r\nIn my annual message of December 5, 1898, I called attention to the\r\nnecessity for some amendment of the alien contract law. There still remain\r\nimportant features of the rightful application of the eight-hour law for\r\nthe benefit of labor and of the principle of arbitration, and I again\r\ncommend these subjects to the careful attention of the Congress.\r\n\r\nThat there may be secured the best service possible in the Philippine\r\nIslands, I have issued, under date of November 30, 1900, the following\r\norder: The United States Civil Service Commission is directed to render\r\nsuch assistance as may be practicable to the Civil Service Board, created\r\nunder the act of the United States Philippine Commission, for the\r\nestablishment and maintenance of an honest and efficient civil service in\r\nthe Philippine Islands, and for that purpose to conduct examinations for\r\nthe civil service of the Philippine islands, upon the request of the Civil\r\nService Board of said islands, under such regulations as may be agreed upon\r\nby the said Board and the said United States Civil Service Commission. The\r\nCivil Service Commission is greatly embarrassed in its work for want of an\r\nadequate permanent force for clerical and other assistance. Its needs are\r\nfully set forth in its report. I invite attention to the report, and\r\nespecially urge upon the Congress that this important bureau of the public\r\nservice, which passes upon the qualifications and character of so large a\r\nnumber of the officers and employees of the Government, should be supported\r\nby all needed appropriations to secure promptness and efficiency.\r\n\r\nI am very much impressed with the statement made by the heads of all the\r\nDepartments of the urgent necessity of a hall of public records. In every\r\ndepartmental building in Washington, so far as I am informed, the space for\r\nofficial records is not only exhausted, but the walls of rooms are lined\r\nwith shelves, the middle floor space of many rooms is filled with the\r\ncases, and garrets and basements, which were never intended and are\r\nunfitted for their accommodation, are crowded with them. Aside from the\r\ninconvenience there is great danger, not only from fire, but from the\r\nweight of these records upon timbers not intended for their support. There\r\nshould be a separate building especially designed for the purpose of\r\nreceiving and preserving the annually accumulating archives of the several\r\nExecutive Departments. Such a hall need not be a costly structure, but\r\nshould be so arranged as to admit of enlargement from time to time. I\r\nurgently recommend that the Congress take early action in this matter.\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Congress a resolution adopted at a recent meeting of the\r\nAmerican Bar Association concerning the proposed celebration of John\r\nMarshall Day, February 4, 1901. Fitting exercises have been arranged, and\r\nit is earnestly desired by the committee that the Congress may participate\r\nin this movement to honor the memory of the great jurist.\r\n\r\nThe transfer of the Government to this city is a fact of great historical\r\ninterest. Among the people there is a feeling of genuine pride in the\r\nCapital of the Republic.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of interest in this connection that in 1800 the population\r\nof the District of Columbia was 14,093; to-day it is 278,718. The\r\npopulation of the city of Washington was then 3,210; to-day it is 218,196.\r\n\r\nThe Congress having provided for \"an appropriate national celebration of\r\nthe Centennial Anniversary of the Establishment of the Seat of the\r\nGovernment in the District of Columbia,\" the committees authorized by it\r\nhave prepared a programme for the 12th of December, 1900, which date has\r\nbeen selected as the anniversary day. Deep interest has been shown in the\r\narrangements for the celebration by the members of the committees of the\r\nSenate and House of Representatives, the committee of Governors appointed\r\nby the President, and the committees appointed by the citizens and\r\ninhabitants of the District of Columbia generally. The programme, in\r\naddition to a reception and other exercises at the Executive Mansion,\r\nprovides commemorative exercises to be held jointly by the Senate and House\r\nof Representatives in the Hall of the House of Representatives, and a\r\nreception in the evening at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in honor of the\r\nGovernors of the States and Territories.\r\n\r\nIn our great prosperity we must guard against the danger it invites of\r\nextravagance in Government expenditures and appropriations; and the chosen\r\nrepresentatives of the people will, I doubt not, furnish an example in\r\ntheir legislation of that wise economy which in a season of plenty husbands\r\nfor the future. In this era of great business activity and opportunity\r\ncaution is not untimely. It will not abate, but strengthen, confidence. It\r\nwill not retard, but promote, legitimate industrial and commercial\r\nexpansion. Our growing power brings with it temptations and perils\r\nrequiring constant vigilance to avoid. It must not be used to invite\r\nconflicts, nor for oppression, but for the more effective maintenance of\r\nthose principles of equality and justice upon which our institutions and\r\nhappiness depend. Let us keep always in mind that the foundation of our\r\nGovernment is liberty; its superstructure peace.",
