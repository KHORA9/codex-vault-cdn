Baker_, at the _Black-Boy_ in _Pater-Noster-Row_.\r\n1713. Price Six Pence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ANSWER\r\n\r\nTO A QUESTION, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat we are to have a peace, or that the peace is made, what sort of\r\npeace, or how it has been brought about; these are questions the world\r\nbegins to have done with, they have been so much, so often, and to so\r\nlittle purpose banded about, and tossed like a shuttlecock, from one\r\nparty to another; the parties themselves begin to want breath to rail\r\nand throw scandal. Roper and Ridpath, like two Tom T--men, have thrown\r\nnight-dirt at one another so long, and groped into so many Jakes's up\r\nto their elbows to find it, that they stink now in the nostrils of\r\ntheir own party. They are become perfectly nauseous to read; the\r\nnation is surfeited of them, and the people begin to be tired with\r\nill-using one another. Would any tolerable face appear upon things, we\r\nmight expect the people would be inclined to be easy; and were the\r\neyes of some great men open, they may see this was the opportunity\r\nthey never had before, to make the nation easy, and themselves safe.\r\nThe main thing which agitates the minds of men now, is the protestant\r\nsuccession and the pretender. Much pains have been taken on both sides\r\nto amuse the world about this remaining dispute; one side to make us\r\nbelieve it is safe, and the other to convince us it is in danger.\r\nNeither side hath been able to expatiate upon the part they affirm.\r\nThose who say the protestant succession is secure, have not yet shown\r\nus any step taken, since these new transactions, for its particular\r\nsecurity. Those who say it is in danger, have not so clearly\r\ndetermined, even among themselves, from what particular head of public\r\nmanagement that danger chiefly proceeds. Both these uncertainties\r\nserve to perplex us, and to leave the thing more undetermined than\r\nconsists with the public ease of the people's minds. To contribute\r\nsomething to that ease, and bring those whose place it is to consider\r\nof ways to make the people easy in this case, this work is made\r\npublic. Possibly, the question propounded may not meet with a\r\ncategorical answer. But this is certain, it shall show you more\r\ndirectly what is the chief question which the substance of things\r\nbefore us is like to turn upon; and to which all our questions seem to\r\ntend. Were the great difficulty of the succession brought to a narrow\r\ncompass, though we might spend fewer words about it, we should sooner\r\ncome to a direct answer. Before I come to the great and chief question\r\nupon which this affair so much seems to turn, it seems needful to put\r\nthe previous question upon which so much debate has been among us, and\r\nlet that be examined. This previous question is this: Is there any\r\nreal danger of the protestant succession? Is there any danger that the\r\npretender shall be brought in upon us? Is there any danger of popery\r\nand tyranny, by restoring the son, as they call him, of abdicated King\r\nJames? This is the previous question, as we may now call it. It is\r\nwell known that there are some people among us, who are so far from\r\nallowing that there is any such danger as the said question mentions,\r\nthat they will have it to be a token of disaffection to the government\r\nto put the question, and are for loading whoever shall offer to start\r\nsuch a question, with characters and party-marks odious to good men,\r\nsuch as incendiary, promoter of discontents, raiser of faction,\r\ndivider of the people, and the like: names which the writer of these\r\nsheets, at the same time, both contemns and abhors. He cannot see that\r\nhe is any enemy to the queen, in inquiring as diligently as possible,\r\nwhether there are any attempts to depose her, or dangerous prospects\r\nof bringing in the hated rival of her glory and dominion. It is so far\r\nfrom that, that it is apparently the duty of every true subject of her\r\nmajesty, to inquire seriously, whether the public peace, the queen's\r\nsafety, her throne, or her person, is in any danger from the wicked\r\ndesign of her, and her people's enemies. Wherefore, and for the joint\r\nconcern every protestant Briton has in this thing, I shall make no\r\ndifficulty, plainly and seriously to state, and to answer this\r\nprevious question, viz., Whether there is any danger of the protestant\r\nsuccession from the present measures, and from the present people\r\nconcerned? I am not ignorant of what has been said by some, to prove\r\nthat the present ministry cannot be suspected of having any view to\r\nthe pretender in any of their measures. The best reason which I have\r\nseen given upon that subject, is, that it is not their interest; and\r\nthat as we have not found them fools that are blind to their own\r\ninterest; that either do not understand, or pursue it. This we find\r\nhandled sundry ways, by sundry authors, and very much insisted upon as\r\na foundation for us to build upon. We shall give our thoughts upon it\r\nwith plainness, and without fear or favour. Good manners require we\r\nshould speak of the ministry with all due regard to their character\r\nand persons. This, a tract designed to inquire seriously of a weighty\r\nand essential, not a trifling thing, which requires but a trifling\r\nexamination; nor shall it be handled here with satire and scurrility.\r\nWe approve neither of the flatteries of one side, nor the insultings\r\nof the other. We shall readily and most willingly join with those who\r\nare of opinion that it is not the interest of the ministry to be for\r\nthe pretender, and that the ministry are not blind to, or careless of,\r\ntheir own interest; and consequently, that the ministry cannot be for\r\nthe pretender. This I hope may be called a direct answer. When I say\r\n\"cannot,\" I must not be understood potentially, that they have no\r\nmoral capacity; but they cannot without such inconsistencies,\r\ncontradictions, and improbable things happening in, which render it\r\nhighly irrational so much as to suppose it of them. To shut the door\r\nagainst any possibility of cavil, it may be needful also to take it\r\nwith us as we go, what we mean by the words \"be for\" the pretender;\r\nand this can be no otherwise understood, than to have a design,\r\nhowever remote, and upon whatever views, to bring him in to possess\r\nthe throne of these kingdoms. The matter then being laid down thus, as\r\nsincerely and plainly as possible, we come to the question\r\npoint-blank, and think it our duty to say with the greatest sincerity,\r\nthat we do not believe the ministry are in any kind, or with any\r\nprospect, near or remote, acting for or with a design or view to bring\r\nin the pretender. Having granted this, we must, however, to prevent\r\nany breaking in, by way of cavil on one hand, or triumph on the other,\r\nsubjoin immediately, that we do not in the least grant by this that\r\nthe protestant succession is in no danger, even from several of the\r\nmeasures now taken in the world. It is far from any reflection upon\r\nthe ministry to say that, however they may act upon a right sincere\r\nprinciple for the protestant succession in all they do, which, as\r\nabove, we profess to believe, yet that many of the tools they make use\r\nof are of another make, and have no edge to cut any other way; no\r\nthoughts to move them towards any other end; no other centre, which\r\nthey can have any tendency to; that the pretender's interest is the\r\nmagnet which draws them by its secret influence to point to him as\r\ntheir pole; that they have their aim at his establishment here, and\r\nown it to be their aim; and as they are not shy to profess it among\r\nthemselves, so their conduct in many things makes it sufficiently\r\npublic. This is not meant as any reflection upon the ministry for\r\nmaking use of such men: the late ministry did the same, and every\r\nministry will, and must employ men sometimes, not as they always join\r\nwith them in their politic principles, but as either the men are found\r\nuseful in their several employments, or as the ministry may be under\r\nother circumstances, which makes it necessary to them to employ them.\r\nNor, as the Review well enough observed, does it follow that because\r\nthe ministry have employed or joined with jacobites in the public\r\naffairs, that therefore they must have done it with a jacobite\r\nprinciple. But let the ministry employ these men by what necessity, or\r\nupon what occasion they will, though it may not follow that the\r\nministry are therefore for the pretender, yet it does not also follow\r\nthat there is no danger of the protestant succession from the\r\nemploying those sort of people: For, what if the queen should die?\r\n\r\nThe ministry, it is hoped, are established in the interest of their\r\nqueen and country; and therefore it has been argued, that supposing\r\nthe ministry had the pretender in their eye, yet that it is irrational\r\nto suggest that they can have any such view during the life of her\r\npresent majesty. Nay, even those professed jacobites, who we spoke of\r\njust now, cannot be so ungrateful to think of deposing the queen, who\r\nhas been so bountiful, so kind, so exceeding good to them, as in\r\nseveral cases to suffer them to be brought into the management of her\r\nown affairs, when by their character they might have been thought\r\ndangerous, even to her person; thus winning and engaging them by her\r\nbounty, and the confidence that has been placed in them, not to\r\nattempt anything to her prejudice, without the most monstrous\r\ningratitude, without flying in the face of all that sense of honour\r\nand obligation, which it is possible for men of common sense to\r\nentertain. And it can hardly be thought that even papists themselves,\r\nunder the highest possessions of their religious zeal, can conquer the\r\nnative aversions they must have to such abominable ingratitude, or to\r\nthink of bringing in the pretender upon this protestant nation, even\r\nwhile the queen shall be on the throne. But though this may, and some\r\ndoubt that also, tie up their hands during the queen's life, yet they\r\nthemselves give us but small reason to expect anything from them\r\nafterward, and it will be hard to find anybody to vouch for them then.\r\nThese very jacobites, papists, and professed enemies to the\r\nrevolution, may be supposed upon these pretensions to be quiet, and\r\noffer no violence to the present establishment while her majesty has\r\nthe possession, and while that life lasts, to which they are so much\r\nindebted for her royal goodness and clemency. But what would they do\r\nif the queen should die?\r\n\r\nCome we next to the French king. We are told, that not the French king\r\nonly, but even the whole French nation, are wonderfully forward to\r\nacknowledge the obligation they are under to the justice and favour\r\nwhich they have received from her majesty, in the putting an end to\r\nthe war; a war which lay heavy upon them, and threatened the very name\r\nof the French nation with ruin, and much more threatened the glory of\r\nthe French court, and of their great monarch, with an entire\r\noverthrow, a total eclipse. A war which, by their own confession, it\r\nwas impossible for them long to have supported the expenses of, and\r\nwhich, by the great superiority of the allies, became dreadful to\r\nthem, and that every campaign more than the other; a war which they\r\nwere in such pain to see the end of, that they tried all the powers\r\nand courts in Christendom, who were the least neutral, to engage a\r\nmediation in order to a treaty, and all in vain; and a war which, if\r\nher majesty had not inclined to put an end to, must have ended perhaps\r\nto the disadvantage and confusion of both France and Spain, if not of\r\nall Christendom. The obligations the French are under for the bringing\r\nthis war to so just and honourable a conclusion are not at all\r\nconcealed. Nay, the French themselves have not been backward to make\r\nthem public. The declarations made by the French king of his sincerity\r\nin the overtures made for a general peace, the protestations of his\r\nbeing resolved to enter into an entire confidence, and a league\r\noffensive and defensive with the queen's majesty for the preservation\r\nof the peace of Christendom, his recognition of her majesty's just\r\nright to the crown, his entering into articles to preserve the union,\r\nacknowledging the ninth electorate in favour of the house of Hanover,\r\nand joining in the great affair of the protestant succession. As these\r\nall convince the world of the necessity his affairs were reduced to,\r\nand the great advantages accruing to him by a peace, so they seem to\r\nbe so many arguments against our fears of the French entering into any\r\nengagements against the crown of Britain, much less any against the\r\npossession of the queen during her life. Not that the honour and\r\nsincerity of the king of France is a foundation fit for her majesty or\r\nher people to have any dependence upon; and the fraction of former\r\ntreaties by that court, when the glory of that monarch, or his\r\nparticular views of things has dictated such opportunity to him as he\r\nthought fit to close with, are due cautions to us all not to have any\r\ndependence of that kind. But the state of his affairs, and the\r\ncondition the war has reduced him to, may give us some ground to think\r\nourselves safe on that side. He knows what power he has taken off from\r\nhis enemies in making peace with her majesty; he knows very well with\r\nwhat loss he sits down, how his affairs are weakened, and what need he\r\nhas to take breath after so terrible a war; besides the flame such an\r\naction would kindle again in Europe; how it would animate this whole\r\nBritish nation against him, in such a manner, and endanger bringing in\r\na new war, and perhaps a new confederacy upon him so violently, and\r\nthat before he would be in a condition to match them, that no one can\r\nreasonably suppose the French king will run the hazard of it. And\r\nthese things may tend to make some people easier than ordinary in the\r\naffair of the succession, believing that the French king stands in too\r\nmuch need of the favour of the queen of Great Britain, whose power it\r\nwell behoves him to keep in friendship with him, and whose nation he\r\nwill be very cautious of provoking a third time, as he has already\r\ndone twice, to his fatal experience. All these things, we say, may\r\nseem pretty well to assure us that nothing is to be feared on that\r\nside so long as her majesty lives to sit upon the British throne. But\r\nall leaves our grand question unanswered; and though we may argue\r\nstrongly for the French king's conduct while the present reign\r\ncontinues, yet few will say, What he will do if the queen should die?\r\n\r\nNay, we may even mention the pretender himself, if he has any about\r\nhim whose councils are fit to be depended upon, and can direct him to\r\nmake a wise and prudent judgment of his own affairs; if he acts by any\r\nscope of policy, and can take his measures with any foresight; most\r\neasy is it for them to see that it must be in vain for him to think of\r\nmaking any attempt in Britain during the life of the queen, or to\r\nexpect to depose her majesty, and set himself up. The French power,\r\nupon which he has already in vain depended, as it has not hitherto\r\nbeen able to serve him, or his father, but that their exile has\r\ncontinued now above twenty-four years, so much less can he be able to\r\nassist him now, while he has been brought as it were to kneel to the\r\nBritish court to put an end for him to this cruel destructive war; the\r\nreason is just spoken to, viz., that this would be to rekindle that\r\nflame which he has gotten so lately quenched, and which cost him so\r\nmuch art, so much management, so much submission to the allies, to\r\nendeavour the quenching of before. To attack the queen of Great\r\nBritain now in behalf of the pretender, would not only be in the\r\nhighest degree ungrateful, perfidious, and dishonourable, but would\r\nfor ever make the British court, as well as the whole nation, his\r\nviolent and implacable enemies; but would also involve him again in a\r\nnew war with all Europe, who would very gladly fall in again with\r\nBritain to pull down more effectually the French power, which has so\r\nlong been a terror to its neighbours; so that the pretender can expect\r\nno help from the king of France. As to what the pope, the Spaniard,\r\nand a few petty popish powers, who might pretend upon a religious\r\nprospect to assist him, and with whose aid, and the assistance of his\r\nparty here, he may think fit to hazard an attempt here for the crown,\r\nit is evident, and his own friends will agree in it, that while the\r\nqueen lives, it is nonsense, and ridiculous for them to attempt it;\r\nthat it would immediately arm the whole nation against them, as one\r\nman; and in human probability it would, like as his supposed father\r\nwas served at the revolution, be the ruin of his whole interest, and\r\nblow him at once quite out of the nation. I believe that there are\r\nvery few who alarm themselves much with the fears of the pretender,\r\nfrom the apprehension of his own strength from abroad, or from his\r\nown party and friends at home here, were they once sure that he should\r\nreceive no assistance from the king of France. If then the king of\r\nFrance cannot be reasonably supposed either to be inclined, or be in a\r\ncondition to appear for him, or act in his behalf, during the life of\r\nthe queen, neither can the pretender, say some, unless he is resolved\r\nto ruin all his friends, and at last to ruin himself, make any attempt\r\nof that kind during her majesty's life. But what if the queen should\r\ndie?\r\n\r\nHaving then viewed the several points of the nation's compass whence\r\nour danger of jacobite plots and projects against the protestant\r\nsuccession may be expected to come, let us now inquire a little of the\r\nstate of the nation, that we make a right estimate of our condition,\r\nand may know what to trust to in cases of difficulty, as they lie\r\nbefore us. In doing this, as well to avoid giving offence to the\r\npeople now in power, as to the entering into the quarrels which engage\r\nthe present contending parties in this divided nation, we shall allow,\r\nhowever some may think fit to question it, the main debate; and grant\r\nthis for the present as a fundamental, viz., That we are in no danger\r\nof the pretender during this queen's reign, or during this ministry's\r\nadministration under her majesty; and avoiding all contention of that\r\nkind, shall allow our condition to be safe in every article as we go\r\nalong, for so long as the queen lives, referring the observation of\r\nthings in every head to those who can answer the main question in our\r\ntitle, viz., But what if the queen should die?\r\n\r\nFirst of all, it may be noticed, that the present safety of this\r\nnation, whether we respect liberty, religion, property, or public\r\nsafety and prosperity, depends upon this one fundamental, viz., that\r\nalluding reverently to that text of Scripture, we are all built upon\r\nthe foundation of the late revolution, established law and right being\r\nthe chief corner-stone. By this it is that her majesty is made our\r\nqueen, the entail of the crown being reserved in the remainder to her\r\nmajesty in the act of settlement made at the filling up the vacant\r\nthrone, and by all those subsequent acts which her majesty's title was\r\nconfirmed by, during the life of the late king. This revolution is\r\nthat upon which the liberties and religion of this nation were rebuilt\r\nafter the conflagration that was made of them in the calamitous times\r\nof King Charles II., and King James II., and from hence to the love\r\nof liberty which is found almost to be naturally placed in the hearts\r\nof true Britons; and upon the view whereof they have acted all along\r\nin the late war, and in all their transactions at home has obtained\r\nthe title of a \"revolution principle.\" Noting this then, as above,\r\nthat her majesty is our queen by virtue of the revolution, and that\r\nduring her reign that establishment alone must be the foundation of\r\nall her administration, this must effectually secure us against any\r\napprehension that the persons acting under her majesty can act in\r\nbehalf of the pretender during her majesty's life; for that they must\r\nimmediately overthrow the throne, turn the queen out of it, and\r\nrenounce the revolution, upon which her majesty's possession is\r\nestablished: as the revolution, therefore, is the base upon which the\r\nthrone of her majesty is established, so her majesty, and all that act\r\nunder her, are obliged to act upon the foot of the said revolution,\r\neven _will_ they, _nil_ they, or else they sink immediately out of\r\nrightful power to act at all; her majesty's title would fall to the\r\nground, their own commissions would from that hour be void; they must\r\ndeclare their royal mistress and benefactress a subject to the\r\npretender, and all her pretences of rightful possession injurious, and\r\nan usurpation. These things being so plain, that he that runs may read\r\nthem, seem to stop all our mouths from so much as any suggestion that\r\nanybody can attempt to bring in the pretender upon us during the life\r\nof her present majesty. But what if the queen should die?\r\n\r\nSubsequent to the revolution, many essential things are formed by our\r\nparliaments and government for the public good, on the foundation of\r\nwhich much of the present peace of the nation is founded; and while\r\nthe said revolution-foundation stands fast, there is good ground to\r\nbelieve those essential points shall be preserved. If then we are\r\nsatisfied that the revolution principle shall subsist as long as the\r\nqueen lives, then for so long we may have good ground to believe we\r\nshall enjoy all those advantages and benefits which we received from\r\nthe said revolution. But still, when we look back upon those dear\r\nprivileges, the obtaining of which has cost so much money, and the\r\nmaintaining of which has cost so much blood, we must with a deep sigh\r\nreflect upon the precarious circumstances of the nation, whose best\r\nprivileges hang uncertain upon the nice and tender thread of royal\r\nmortality, and say we are happy while these last, and these may last\r\nwhile her majesty shall live. But what if the queen should die?\r\n\r\nLet us descend to some other particulars of those blessings which we\r\ndo enjoy purely as the effect of the revolution, and examine in what\r\nposture we stand with respect to them, and what assurance we have of\r\ntheir continuance: and first, as to TOLERATION. This was the greatest\r\nand first blessing the nation felt after the immediate settlement of\r\nthe crown, which was established by virtue of the revolution\r\nengagement, mentioned in the Prince of Orange's declaration. The\r\ndesign of this law, as it was to give liberty for the worship of God\r\nto such dissenters as could not conform to the Church of England, and\r\nto give ease to tender consciences, so as by the law itself is\r\nexpressed; it was to ease the minds of their majesties' subjects, and\r\nto give general quiet to the nation, whose peace had been frequently\r\ndisturbed by the violence of persecution. We have seen frequent\r\nassurances given of the inviolable preservation of this toleration by\r\nher majesty from the throne in her speeches to the parliament; and\r\nduring her majesty's reign, we have great reason to hope the quiet of\r\nthe poor people shall not be broken by either repealing that law, or\r\ninvading the intent and meaning of it while in force; and there are a\r\ngreat many reasons to hope that the present ministry are so far\r\nconvinced of the necessity of the said toleration, in order to\r\npreserve the peace, and the common neighbourhood of people, that they\r\ncan have no thought of breaking in upon it, or any way making the\r\npeople who enjoy it, uneasy. Nay, the rather we believe this, because\r\nthe ferment such a breach would put the whole nation into is not the\r\nsafest condition the government can be in upon any account; and as the\r\nministry cannot be supposed to desire to give uneasiness and\r\nprovocation to the commons, but rather to keep them easy and quiet,\r\nand prevent the enemies of the present management from having any\r\nhandle to take hold of to foment distractions and disturbances among\r\nthe people, it cannot be thought that they will push at the\r\ntoleration, so as to deprive the people of so considerable a thing.\r\nBut after the present happy establishment shall have received such a\r\nfatal blow as that will be of the queen's death, and when popish\r\npretenders, and French influences, shall prevail, it may well be\r\nexpected then, that not toleration of dissenters only, but even of\r\nthe whole protestant religion, may be in danger to be lost; so that,\r\nhowever secure we are of the free enjoyment of liberty of religion\r\nduring the queen's life, we may be very well allowed to ask this\r\nquestion with respect to, not toleration only, but the Church of\r\nEngland also, viz., what will become of them, If the queen should die?\r\n\r\nFrom toleration in England, come we to the constitution of religious\r\naffairs in Scotland; and here we have different views from what the\r\ncase in England affords us; the powerful interest of jacobitism, if it\r\nmay be said to be formidable anywhere, is so there. The enemies of the\r\nrevolution are all the implacable enemies of the church establishment\r\nthere: nay, many thousands are the declared enemies of the revolution,\r\nand of the queen's being upon the throne, from a mere implacable\r\naversion to the presbyterian kirk, which is erected and established by\r\nthat very revolution which has set the queen upon the throne. The\r\nunion, which has yet farther established that presbyterian kirk, is\r\nfor that reason the aversion of the same people, as it is the aversion\r\nof the jacobites, by being a farther confirmation of the Hanover\r\nsuccession, and a farther fixing the queen upon the throne. Now, as it\r\nis sure, that as before, while the queen lives, and the revolution\r\ninfluence carries its usual force in the kingdoms now united, the\r\npresbyterian kirk must and will remain, and all the little\r\nencroachments which have been made upon the kirk, as it may be\r\nobserved, though they have created uneasiness enough, yet they still\r\nseem to suppose that the establishment itself cannot be overthrown.\r\nThe union and the revolution settlement remain in Scotland, and must\r\nremain, as is said; while the queen lives we can have no apprehensions\r\nof them; the reasons are given above; and as we said before, we are to\r\ntake them for granted in this discourse, to avoid other cavils. While\r\nthen the revolution and the union are to be the foundation of the\r\nadministration in Scotland, the presbyterian established church\r\ngovernment there must also remain as the only legal kirk constitution,\r\nand so long we can entertain no fears of anything on that account. But\r\nwhat if the queen should die?\r\n\r\nFrom such religious concerns as effect presbyterians, and other\r\nsectaries, or dissenters, as we call them, let us take a look at the\r\nremote danger of the Church of England. We have had a great deal of\r\ndistraction in the time of the late ministry about the danger of the\r\nchurch; and as it appears by the memorial of the church of England,\r\npublished in those times, and reprinted since; by the sermons of Dr.\r\nSacheverell, and the eminent speeches at his trial, that danger was\r\nmore especially suggested to come from the increase of dissenters\r\nhere, the ministry of the whigs, and the establishing presbyterianism\r\nin the north of Britain. These things being in a great measure now\r\noverthrown by the late change of the ministry, and the new methods\r\ntaken in the management of the public affairs, the people, who were\r\nthen supposed to aim at overthrowing the ministry of those whigs, are\r\npleased to assure us of the safety and flourishing condition of the\r\nchurch now more than ever; while the other party, taking up the like\r\ncry of the danger of the church, tells us, that now a real visible\r\nappearance of danger to the church is before us; and that not only to\r\nthe church of England as such, but even to the whole interest and\r\nsafety of the protestant religion in Britain; that this danger is\r\nimminent and unavoidable, from the great growth and increase of\r\npopery, and professed jacobitism in the nation. This indeed they give\r\nbut too great demonstrations of from the spreading of popish agents\r\namong us, whose professed employment it is to amuse and impose upon\r\nthe poor country people, as well in matters of jacobitism as of\r\nreligion, and the great successes these emissaries of Satan have\r\nobtained in several parts of Britain, but especially in the north.\r\nNow, though we cannot but acknowledge but that much of this alarm is\r\njustly grounded, and that the endeavours of popish and jacobite agents\r\nand emissaries in divers parts of Britain are too apparently\r\nsuccessful, yet as wise men could never see into the reality of such\r\ndanger, as was by some people pretended to be impending over the\r\nchurch in the time of the late ministry, so neither can we allow that\r\npopery is so evidently at the door at this time, as that we should be\r\napprehensive of having the church of England immediately transversed,\r\nand the protestant religion in Britain: and one great reason for this\r\nopinion is, that her majesty, who is a zealous professor of the\r\nprotestant religion, and has been bred up in the bosom of the church\r\nof England, is so rooted in principle, and has declared from her very\r\ninfancy such horror and aversion to popery, that it cannot enter into\r\nany true protestant thoughts to apprehend anything of that kind,\r\nwhile her majesty lives. But, Lord have mercy upon us! What if the\r\nqueen should die?\r\n\r\nFrom religious matters, come we next to consider civil interest,\r\nliberties, privileges, properties; the great article that in the late\r\nrevolution went always coupled in the nation's negative with that of\r\nreligion, as if they were woven together, and was always cried upon by\r\nthe mob in one breath, viz., No popery, no slavery. The first of these\r\nconcerns our civil interest; such as the public credit, by the\r\noccasions of a long and expensive war, and to prevent levying severe\r\ntaxes for the carrying on the war, such as would be grievous to trade,\r\noppressive to the poor, and difficult to be paid. The parliament, for\r\nthe ease of the subjects, thought fit, rather to lay funds of interest\r\nto raise money upon, by way of loan, establishing those interests,\r\npayable as annuities and annual payments, for the benefit of those who\r\nadvanced their money for the public service. And to make these things\r\ncurrent, that the public credit might be sacred, and the people be\r\nmade free to advance their money, all possible assurances of\r\nparliament have been given, that the payments of interests and\r\nannuities shall be kept punctually, and exactly according to the acts\r\nof parliament, that no misapplications of the money shall be made, or\r\nconverting the money received upon one to make good the deficiency of\r\nthe other; and hitherto the injunctions of that kind have been exactly\r\nobserved, and the payments punctually made, which we call the credit\r\nof the nation. At the first of the late change, when the new ministry\r\nbegan to act, the fright the people were put in upon the suggestion of\r\nsome, that all the parliamentary funds should be wiped off with a\r\nsponge, was very considerable; and the credit of those funds sunk\r\nexceedingly with but the bare apprehension of such a blow, the sums\r\nbeing infinitely great, and the number of indigent families being\r\nincredibly many, whose whole substance lay in those securities, and\r\nwhose bread depended upon those interests being punctually paid; but\r\nwiser men saw quickly there was no ground for those fears; that the\r\nnew ministry stood upon a foot that could no more be supported without\r\nthe public credit than those that went before them; that especially\r\nwhile they were under a necessity of borrowing farther sums, they\r\nbehoved to secure the punctual paying of the old; and by making the\r\npeople entirely easy, not only take from them the apprehensions they\r\nwere under of losing what they lent already, but make them forward and\r\nwilling to advance more to this purpose, they not only endeavoured to\r\ngive the people all satisfaction that their money was safe, and that\r\nthe funds laid by the parliament in the former ministry should be kept\r\nsacred, and the payments punctually made, but took care to obtain\r\nparliamentary securities, by real funds to be settled for the payment\r\nof those debts contracted by the former ministry, and for which no\r\nprovision was made before. This was the establishment of a fund for\r\npayment of the interests of the navy debt, ordnance, victualling,\r\ntransport, &c., to the value of seven or eight millions, which is the\r\nsubstance of what we new call the South-sea stock. By this means the\r\npublic credit, which it was suggested would receive such a blow at the\r\nChange as that it should never recover again, and that it would be\r\nimpossible for the new ministry to raise any needful sums of money for\r\nthe carrying on the war, or for the public occasions, recovered itself\r\nso as that the government hath ever since found it easy to borrow\r\nwhatever sums they thought fit to demand, in the same manner as\r\nbefore. Now that these loans are safe, no man that weighs the\r\ncircumstances of the ministry and government, and the circumstances of\r\nthe people, can doubt; the first being in a constant necessity of\r\nsupporting the public credit for the carrying on the public affairs,\r\non any sudden emergency that may happen, and being liable to the\r\nresentment of parliament, if any open infraction should be made upon\r\nthe funds, which touches so nearly the honour of the parliaments, and\r\nthe interest of most of the best families in the nation. While this is\r\nthe case, we think it is not rational to believe that any ministry\r\nwill venture to attack parliamentary credit, in such a manner; and\r\nthis will eminently be the case as long as her majesty sits on the\r\nthrone. Nor can a thing so barefacedly tyrannical and arbitrary, and,\r\nabove all, dishonourable and unjust, be suggested as possible to be\r\nattempted in the reign of so just and conscientious a prince; so that\r\nwe may be very willing to allow that there is not the least danger of\r\nthe public faith being broken, the public credit lost, the public\r\nfunds stopped, or the money being misapplied. No cheat, no sponge,\r\nwhile her majesty lives. But, alas for us! What if the queen should\r\ndie?\r\n\r\nFrom this piece of civil right, come we to those things we call\r\nliberties and privileges. These may indeed be joined in some respects;\r\nbut as we are engaged in speaking particularly to such points, wherein\r\nour present dangers do or do not appear, it is proper to mention them\r\napart. Privileges may be distinguished here from liberties, as they\r\nrespect affairs of trade, corporations, parliaments, and legislature,\r\n&c. Liberty, as they respect laws, establishments, declared right, and\r\nsuch like. As to the first, from the revolution to this time, they\r\nhave not only been confirmed, which we had before, but many privileges\r\nadded to the people, some of which are essential to the well-being of\r\nthe kingdom. All the _quo warrantos_ against corporation privileges,\r\nthe high commission court against the church's privileges extending\r\nprerogative in detriment of the subject's natural right, and many such\r\nthings, which were fatal to the privileges of this protestant nation,\r\nwere laid aside, and received their just condemnation in the\r\nrevolution; and not so only, but the privileges obtained since the\r\nrevolution by consent of parliament, are very considerable; such as\r\nthe toleration to this part of Britain, and the establishment of the\r\nchurch of Scotland; for the north part; in matters of religion; such\r\nas the triennial election of parliaments; in civil affairs, such as\r\nthe several corporations granted upon really useful foundations in\r\ntrade; as the bank company, &c., and such like. These and many more,\r\nwhich may be named, and which these are named only as heads of, are\r\nsecured to us by law; and those laws yet again made sure to us by the\r\nhonour and veracity of her majesty, and as long as her majesty's life\r\nis spared to these nations, we have great reason to believe we shall\r\nrather increase than lose our privileges. But what if the queen should\r\ndie?\r\n\r\nOur LIBERTIES, which come next in order, may be summed up in what we\r\ncall legal, and native right; or such as by the natural consequence of\r\na free nation, and a just government; or such as by mutual assent and\r\nconsent of sovereign and subject, are become the legal right of the\r\nlatter. These, needless to be enumerated here, are summed up into one;\r\nor are expressly enacted by statute law, and thereby become\r\nfundamental to the constitution. These receive no wound, but one of\r\nthese two ways, either by open infraction and contempt of right, or by\r\ndispensing arbitrary power; both of which, by the many assurances from\r\nthe throne, by the constant jealousies of parliaments, and the full\r\nliberty they have more of late than ever taken to examine into, and\r\ncensure breaches of the laws, we are very well assured shall not be\r\nattempted in her majesty's time: nay, on the contrary, the\r\nsuperiority, and influence of parliaments over and upon the management\r\nof public matters, nay, even their influence upon the royal majesty of\r\nthe sovereign, has been such, and has in such a manner insensibly\r\nincreased of late, that the like has never been known or practised in\r\nthis nation for some ages before. We see her majesty declines\r\nextending her prerogative, either to the detriment of her subjects, in\r\ncases civil or religious, and wherein it might be so extended; nay,\r\nwhen even the parliament have desired her to extend it: so that we\r\nhave a great satisfaction in the safety of our established liberties,\r\nand that no tyrannical, arbitrary invasions of right shall be made\r\nduring her majesty's reign. But what if the queen should die?\r\n\r\nIn like manner for our properties, our estates, inheritance, lands,\r\ngoods, lives, liberties, &c. These are effectually secured by laws of\r\nthe land, and the sovereign in this country, having no right, but by\r\nlaw, to any part of the subject's estate, causes that estate to be\r\ncalled PROPERTY. The kings and queens of Britain are monarchs limited\r\nto act by the laws. When they cease to rule by law, the constitution\r\nis broken, and they become tyrants, and arbitrary, despotic invaders\r\nof right. This is declared by the revolution, wherein the rights of\r\nthe subject are openly, not set down only, but claimed, demanded as\r\nwhat justice required should be granted to them, and as what the\r\nsovereign, as aforesaid, has no right, no pretence, no just authority\r\nto take, or detain from him. This is the great capital and fundamental\r\narticle of Magna Charta, and the foundation upon which all the laws\r\nsubsequent and consequential to Magna Charta have been made. [_No\r\nfreeman shall be taken or imprisoned, or be disseized of his freehold,\r\nor liberties, or free customs, or be outlawed, or exiled, or otherwise\r\ndestroyed; nor we will not pass upon him, nor condemn him, but by\r\nlawful judgment of his peers, or by the law of the land._ Magna\r\nCharta, cap. xxix.] The words are plain and direct; and as to the\r\nsubject we are now upon, they require no comment, no explication.\r\nWhatever they do, as to pleading in law the proof of the subject's\r\nright to the free possession of his own property, is also the less\r\nneedful to enlarge upon here, because it is acknowledged in full and\r\nexpress terms by the sovereign, as well in practice, as in expression.\r\nHer majesty, adhering strictly to this, as a rule, has from the\r\nbeginning of her reign made it her golden rule, to govern according to\r\nlaw. Nor, while the establishment of the crown itself is built upon\r\nthe legal constitution of this nation, can it be otherwise here: that\r\nprince that governs here and not by law, may be said rather to oppress\r\nthan to govern; rather to overrule, than to rule over his people. Now\r\nit cannot without great and unjustifiable violence to her majesty's\r\njust government, be suggested, that we are in any danger of oppression\r\nduring the righteous administration of her majesty's reign. The queen\r\nraises no money without act of parliament, keeps up no standing army\r\nin time of peace, disseizes no man of his property or estate; but\r\nevery man sits in safety under his own vine, and his fig-tree; and we\r\ndoubt not but we shall do as long as her majesty lives. But what if\r\nthe queen should die?\r\n\r\nPossibly cavils may rise in the mouths of those whose conduct this\r\nnice question may seem to affect, that this is a question unfit to be\r\nasked, and questionless such people will have much to say upon that\r\nsubject; as that it is a factious question, a question needless to be\r\nanswered, and impertinent therefore to be asked; that it is a question\r\nwhich respects things remote, and serves only to fill the heads of the\r\npeople with fears and jealousies; that it is a question to which no\r\ndirect answer can be given, and which suggests strange surmises, and\r\namuses people about they know not what, and is of no use, but to make\r\npeople uneasy without cause.\r\n\r\nAs there is no objection, which is material enough to make, but is\r\nmaterial enough to answer, so this, although there is nothing of\r\nsubstance in it, may introduce something in its answer of substance\r\nenough to consider: it is therefore most necessary to convince the\r\nconsidering reader of the usefulness and necessity of putting this\r\nquestion; and then likewise the usefulness and necessity of putting\r\nthis question NOW at this time; and if it appear to be both a needful\r\nquestion itself, and a seasonable question, as to time, the rest of\r\nthe cavils against it will deserve the less regard. That it is a\r\nneedful question, seems justified more abundantly from a very great\r\nexample, to wit, the practice of the whole nation, in settling the\r\nsuccession of the crown. This I take to be nothing else but this: the\r\nqueen having no issue of her body, and the pretender to the crown\r\nbeing expelled by law, included in his father's disastrous flight and\r\nabdication; when the parliament came to consider of the state of the\r\nnation, as to government as it now stands; that King William being\r\nlately dead, and her majesty with universal joy of her people, being\r\nreceived as queen, the safety, and the lasting happiness of the nation\r\nis so far secured. But what if the queen should die?\r\n\r\nThe introduction to all the acts of parliaments for settling the\r\ncrown, implies thus much, and speaks directly this language, viz., to\r\nmake the nation safe and easy in case the queen should die: nor are\r\nany of these acts of parliament impeached of faction, or\r\nimpertinences; much less of needless blaming the people, and filling\r\ntheir heads with fears and jealousies. If this example of the\r\nparliament is not enough justifying to this inquiry, the well known\r\ntruth, upon which that example of parliament is grounded, is\r\nsufficient to justify it, viz., that we all know the queen must die.\r\nNone say this with more concern and regret than those who are\r\nforwardest to put this question, as being of the opinion above said,\r\nthat, we are effectually secured against the pretender, and against\r\nall the terrifying consequences of the Frenchified governors, during\r\nher majesty's life. But this is evident, the queen is mortal, though\r\ncrowned with all that flattering courtiers can bring together, to make\r\nher appear great, glorious, famous, or what you please; yet the queen,\r\nyea, the queen herself, is _mortal_, and MUST die. It is true, kings\r\nand queens are called gods; but this respects their sacred power:\r\nnothing supposing an immortality attending their persons, for they all\r\ndie like other men, and their dust knows no distinction in the grave.\r\nSince then it is most certain that the queen must die, and our safety\r\nand happiness in this nation depends so much upon the stability of our\r\nliberties, religion, and aforesaid dependencies after her majesty's\r\nlife shall end, it cannot be a question offensive to any who has any\r\nconcern in the public good, to inquire into what shall be the state of\r\nour condition, or the posture of our affairs, when the queen shall\r\ndie; but this is not all neither. As the queen is mortal, and we are\r\nassured she must die, so we are none of us certain as to be able to\r\nknow when, or how soon, that disaster may happen; at what time, or in\r\nwhat manner. This then, as it may be remote, and not a long time; God\r\nof his infinite mercy grant it may be long first, and not before this\r\ndifficult question we are upon be effectually and satisfactorily\r\nanswered to the nation; so on the other side, it may be near; none of\r\nus know how near, the fatal blow may befall us soon, and sooner far\r\nthan we may be ready; for to-day it may come, while the cavilling\r\nreader is objecting against our putting this question, and calling it\r\nunreasonable and needless; while the word is in thy very mouth, mayest\r\nthou hear the fatal, melancholy news, the queen is dead. News that\r\nmust one time or other be heard; the word will certainly come some\r\ntime or other, to be spoken in the present sense, and to be sure in\r\nthe time they are spoken in. How can any one then say, that it is\r\nimproper to ask what shall be our case, what shall we do, or what\r\nshall be done with us, If the queen should die?\r\n\r\nBut we have another melancholy incident, which attends the queen's\r\nmortality, and which makes this question more than ordinarily\r\nseasonable to be asked at this time; and that is, that not only the\r\nqueen is mortal, and she must die, and the time uncertain; so that she\r\nmay die, even to-day, before to-morrow, or in a very little space of\r\ntime: but her life is, under God's providence, at the mercy of papists\r\nand jacobites' people; who, the one by their principles, and the other\r\nby the circumstances of their party, are more than ordinarily to be\r\napprehended for their bloody designs against her majesty, and against\r\nthe whole nation. Nay, there seems more reason to be apprehensive of\r\nthe dangerous attempts of these desperate people, at this time, than\r\never, even from the very reasons which are given all along in this\r\nwork, for our being safe in our privileges, our religious and civil\r\nrights, during her majesty's life. It would be mispending your time to\r\nprove that the papists and jacobite parties in this nation, however\r\nthey may, as we have said, be under ties and obligations of honour,\r\ninterest, and gratitude, &c., not to make attempt upon us during the\r\nqueen's life; yet that they are more encouraged at this time than ever\r\nthey were to hope and believe, that when the queen shall die, their\r\nturn stands next. This, we say, we believe is lost labour to speak of:\r\nthe said people, the popish and tory party, will freely own and oppose\r\nit. They all take their obligations to the queen to end with her\r\nmajesty's life. The French king, however in honour and gratitude he\r\nmay think himself bound not to encourage the pretender to insult her\r\nmajesty's dominions, while the queen, with whom he personally is\r\nengaged by treaty, shall remain alive, will think himself fully at\r\nliberty from those obligations when the queen shall die. If we are not\r\nmisinformed of the French affairs, and of the notions they have in\r\nFrance of these things, they are generally no otherwise understood\r\nthan that the king of France is engaged by the peace now in view, not\r\nto disturb her majesty's possession during her reign and her life; but\r\nthat then the pretender's right is to be received everywhere. The\r\npretender himself, howsoever, as above said, he may despair of his\r\nsuccess in attempting to take possession during the queen's life, will\r\nnot fail to assume new hopes at her majesty's death: so much then of\r\nthe hopes of popery and French power; so much of the interest of the\r\npretender depending upon the single thread of life of a mortal person;\r\nand we being well assured that they look upon her majesty only as the\r\nincumbent in a living, or tenant for life in an estate, what is more\r\nnatural, than in this case for us to apprehend danger to the life of\r\nthe queen; especially to such people, who are known not to make much\r\nconsciences of murdering princes, with whom the king-killing doctrine\r\nis so universally received, and who were so often detected of\r\nvillanous practices and plots against the life of Queen Elizabeth, her\r\nmajesty's famous predecessor, and that upon the same foundation, viz.,\r\nthe queen of Scots being the popish pretender to the crown; what can\r\nwe expect from the same party, and men acting from the same\r\nprinciples, but the same practices? It is known that the queen, by\r\ncourse of nature, may live many years, and these people have many\r\nreasons to be impatient of so much delay. They know that many\r\naccidents may intervene to make the circumstances of the nation, at\r\nthe time of the queen's death, less favourable to their interests than\r\nthey are now; they may have fewer friends, as well in power, as out of\r\npower, by length of time, and the like: these, and such as these\r\nconsiderations may excite villanous and murderous practices against\r\nthe precious life of our sovereign (God protect her majesty from\r\nthem); but while all these considerations so naturally offer\r\nthemselves to us, it seems most rational, needful, seasonable, and\r\njust, that we should be asking and answering this great question,\r\nWhat if the queen should die?\r\n\r\nThus far we have only asked the question itself, and showed our\r\nreasons, or endeavoured to justify the reasonableness of the inquiry.\r\nIt follows that we make some brief essay as an answer to the question.\r\nThis may be done many ways; but the design of this tract is rather to\r\nput the question into your thought, than to put an answer into your\r\nmouths. The several answers which may be given to this important\r\nquestion may not be proper for a public print; and some may not be fit\r\nso much as to be spoken. The question is not without its uses, whether\r\nit be answered or no, if the nation be sufficiently awakened but to\r\nask the question among themselves; they will be brought by thinking of\r\nthe thing to answer it one to another in a short space. The people of\r\nBritain want only to be showed what imminent danger they are in, in\r\ncase of the queen's decease: how much their safety and felicity depend\r\nupon the life of her majesty, and what a state of confusion, distress,\r\nand all sorts of dreadful calamities they will fall into at her\r\nmajesty's death, if something be not done to settle them before her\r\ndeath; and if they are not during her majesty's life secured from the\r\npower of France, and the danger of the pretender.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF \"WHAT IF THE QUEEN SHOULD DIE?\"",
