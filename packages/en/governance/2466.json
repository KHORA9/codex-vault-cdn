Townsend\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nTurgenev was the first writer who was able, having both Slavic and\r\nuniversal imagination enough for it, to interpret modern Russia to\r\nthe outer world, and Virgin Soil was the last word of his greater\r\ntestament. It was the book in which many English readers were destined\r\nto make his acquaintance about a generation ago, and the effect of it\r\nwas, like Swinburne’s Songs Before Sunrise, Mazzini’s Duties of Man,\r\nand other congenial documents, to break up the insular confines in\r\nwhich they had been reared and to enlarge their new horizon. Afterwards\r\nthey went on to read Tolstoi, and Turgenev’s powerful and antipathetic\r\nfellow-novelist, Dostoievsky, and many other Russian writers: but as\r\nhe was the greatest artist of them all, his individual revelation of\r\nhis country’s predicament did not lose its effect. Writing in prose\r\nhe achieved a style of his own which went as near poetry as narrative\r\nprose can do without using the wrong music: while over his realism or\r\nhis irony he cast a tinge of that mixed modern and oriental fantasy\r\nwhich belonged to his temperament. He suffered in youth, and suffered\r\nbadly, from the romantic malady of his century, and that other malady\r\nof Russia, both expressed in what M. Haumand terms his “Hamletisme.”\r\nBut in Virgin Soil he is easy and almost negligent master of his\r\ninstrument, and though he is an exile and at times a sharply embittered\r\none, he gathers experience round his theme as only the artist can who\r\nhas enriched his art by having outlived his youth without forgetting\r\nits pangs, joys, mortifications, and love-songs.\r\n\r\nIn Nejdanov it is another picture of that youth which we see—youth\r\nreduced to ineffectiveness by fatalism and by the egoism of the lyric\r\nnature which longs to gain dramatic freedom, but cannot achieve it.\r\nIt is one of a series of portraits, wonderfully traced psychological\r\nstudies of the Russian dreamers and incompatibles of last mid-century,\r\nof which the most moving figure is the hero of the earlier novel,\r\nDimitri Rudin. If we cared to follow Turgenev strictly in his growth\r\nand contemporary relations, we ought to begin with his Sportsman’s Note\r\nBook. But so far as his novels go, he is the last writer to be taken\r\nchronologically. He was old enough in youth to understand old age in the\r\nforest, and young enough in age to provide his youth with fresh hues for\r\nanother incarnation. Another element of his work which is very finely\r\nrevealed and brought to a rare point of characterisation in Virgin Soil,\r\nis the prophetic intention he had of the woman’s part in the new order.\r\nFor the real hero of the tale, as Mr. Edward Garnett has pointed out in\r\nan essay on Turgenev, is not Nejdanov and not Solomin; the part is cast\r\nin the woman’s figure of Mariana who broke the silence of “anonymous\r\nRussia.” Ivan Turgenev had the understanding that goes beneath the old\r\ndelimitation of the novelist hide-bound by the law—“male and female\r\ncreated he them.”\r\n\r\nHe had the same extreme susceptibility to the moods of nature. He\r\nloved her first for herself, and then with a sense of those inherited\r\nprimitive associations with her scenes and hid influences which still\r\nplay upon us to-day; and nothing could be surer than the wilder or tamer\r\nglimpses which are seen in this book and in its landscape settings of\r\nthe characters. But Russ as he is, he never lets his scenery hide his\r\npeople: he only uses it to enhance them. He is too great an artist to\r\nlose a human trait, as we see even in a grotesque vignette like that of\r\nFomishka and Fimishka, or a chance picture like that of the Irish girl\r\nonce seen by Solomin in London.\r\n\r\nTurgenev was born at Orel, son of a cavalry colonel, in 1818. He died\r\nin exile, like his early master in romance Heine—that is in Paris—on\r\nthe 4th of September, 1883. But at his own wish his remains were\r\ncarried home and buried in the Volkoff Cemetery, St. Petersburg. The\r\ngrey crow he had once seen in foreign fields and addressed in a fit of\r\nhomesickness—\r\n\r\n    “Crow, crow,\r\n     You are grizzled, I know,\r\n     But from Russia you come;\r\n     Ah me, there lies home!”\r\n\r\ncalled him back to his mother country, whose true son he remained\r\ndespite all he suffered at her hands, and all the delicate revenges of\r\nthe artistic prodigal that he was tempted to take.\r\n\r\nE.

Noisily shuffling his down-trodden goloshes and slowly\r\nswinging his heavy, clumsy figure, the man at last reached the very top\r\nflight and stopped before a half-open door hanging off its hinges. He\r\ndid not ring the bell, but gave a loud sigh and walked straight into a\r\nsmall, dark passage.\r\n\r\n“Is Nejdanov at home?” he called out in a deep, loud voice.\r\n\r\n“No, he’s not. I’m here. Come in,” an equally coarse woman’s voice\r\nresponded from the adjoining room.\r\n\r\n“Is that Mashurina?” asked the new-comer.\r\n\r\n“Yes, it is I. Are you Ostrodumov?”\r\n\r\n“Pemien Ostrodumov,” he replied, carefully removing his goloshes, and\r\nhanging his shabby coat on a nail, he went into the room from whence\r\nissued the woman’s voice.\r\n\r\nIt was a narrow, untidy room, with dull green coloured walls, badly\r\nlighted by two dusty windows. The furnishings consisted of an iron\r\nbedstead standing in a corner, a table in the middle, several chairs,\r\nand a bookcase piled up with books. At the table sat a woman of about\r\nthirty. She was bareheaded, clad in a black stuff dress, and was smoking\r\na cigarette. On catching sight of Ostrodumov she extended her broad, red\r\nhand without a word. He shook it, also without saying anything, dropped\r\ninto a chair and pulled a half-broken cigar out of a side pocket.\r\nMashurina gave him a light, and without exchanging a single word, or so\r\nmuch as looking at one another, they began sending out long, blue puffs\r\ninto the stuffy room, already filled with smoke.\r\n\r\nThere was something similar about these two smokers, although their\r\nfeatures were not a bit alike. In these two slovenly figures, with their\r\ncoarse lips, teeth, and noses (Ostrodumov was even pock-marked), there\r\nwas something honest and firm and persevering.\r\n\r\n“Have you seen Nejdanov?” Ostrodumov asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes. He will be back directly. He has gone to the library with some\r\nbooks.”\r\n\r\nOstrodumov spat to one side.\r\n\r\n“Why is he always rushing about nowadays? One can never get hold of\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\nMashurina took out another cigarette.\r\n\r\n“He’s bored,” she remarked, lighting it carefully.\r\n\r\n“Bored!” Ostrodumov repeated reproachfully. “What self-indulgence! One\r\nwould think we had no work to do. Heaven knows how we shall get through\r\nwith it, and he complains of being bored!”\r\n\r\n“Have you heard from Moscow?” Mashurina asked after a pause.\r\n\r\n“Yes. A letter came three days ago.”\r\n\r\n“Have you read it?”\r\n\r\nOstrodumov nodded his head.\r\n\r\n“Well? What news?”\r\n\r\n“Some of us must go there soon.”\r\n\r\nMashurina took the cigarette out of her mouth.\r\n\r\n“But why?” she asked. “They say everything is going on well there.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that is so, but one man has turned out unreliable and must be\r\ngot rid of. Besides that, there are other things. They want you to come\r\ntoo.”\r\n\r\n“Do they say so in the letter?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nMashurina shook back her heavy hair, which was twisted into a small\r\nplait at the back, and fell over her eyebrows in front.\r\n\r\n“Well,” she remarked; “if the thing is settled, then there is nothing\r\nmore to be said.”\r\n\r\n“Of course not. Only one can’t do anything without money, and where are\r\nwe to get it from?”\r\n\r\nMashurina became thoughtful.\r\n\r\n“Nejdanov must get the money,” she said softly, as if to herself.\r\n\r\n“That is precisely what I have come about,” Ostrodumov observed.\r\n\r\n“Have you got the letter?” Mashurina asked suddenly.\r\n\r\n“Yes. Would you like to see it?”\r\n\r\n“I should rather. But never mind, we can read it together presently.”\r\n\r\n“You need not doubt what I say. I am speaking the truth,” Ostrodumov\r\ngrumbled.\r\n\r\n“I do not doubt it in the least.” They both ceased speaking and, as\r\nbefore, clouds of smoke rose silently from their mouths and curled\r\nfeebly above their shaggy heads.\r\n\r\nA sound of goloshes was heard from the passage.\r\n\r\n“There he is,” Mashurina whispered.\r\n\r\nThe door opened slightly and a head was thrust in, but it was not the\r\nhead of Nejdanov.\r\n\r\nIt was a round head with rough black hair, a broad wrinkled forehead,\r\nbright brown eyes under thick eyebrows, a snub nose and a humorously-set\r\nmouth. The head looked round, nodded, smiled, showing a set of tiny\r\nwhite teeth, and came into the room with its feeble body, short arms,\r\nand bandy legs, which were a little lame. As soon as Mashurina and\r\nOstrodumov caught sight of this head, an expression of contempt mixed\r\nwith condescension came over their faces, as if each was thinking\r\ninwardly, “What a nuisance!” but neither moved nor uttered a single\r\nword. The newly arrived guest was not in the least taken aback by this\r\nreception, however; on the contrary it seemed to amuse him.\r\n\r\n“What is the meaning of this?” he asked in a squeaky voice. “A duet? Why\r\nnot a trio? And where’s the chief tenor?”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean Nejdanov, Mr. Paklin?” Ostrodumov asked solemnly.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Mr. Ostrodumov.”\r\n\r\n“He will be back directly, Mr. Paklin.”\r\n\r\n“I am glad to hear that, Mr. Ostrodumov.”\r\n\r\nThe little cripple turned to Mashurina. She frowned, and continued\r\nleisurely puffing her cigarette.\r\n\r\n“How are you, my dear... my dear... I am so sorry. I always forget your\r\nChristian name and your father’s name.”\r\n\r\nMashurina shrugged her shoulders.\r\n\r\n“There is no need for you to know it. I think you know my surname. What\r\nmore do you want? And why do you always keep on asking how I am? You see\r\nthat I am still in the land of the living!”\r\n\r\n“Of course!” Paklin exclaimed, his face twitching nervously. “If you had\r\nbeen elsewhere, your humble servant would not have had the pleasure of\r\nseeing you here, and of talking to you! My curiosity is due to a bad,\r\nold-fashioned habit. But with regard to your name, it is awkward,\r\nsomehow, simply to say Mashurina. I know that even in letters you only\r\nsign yourself Bonaparte! I beg pardon, Mashurina, but in conversation,\r\nhowever—”\r\n\r\n“And who asks you to talk to me, pray?”\r\n\r\nPaklin gave a nervous, gulpy laugh.\r\n\r\n“Well, never mind, my dear. Give me your hand. Don’t be cross. I know\r\nyou mean well, and so do I.... Well?”\r\n\r\nPaklin extended his hand, Mashurina looked at him severely and extended\r\nher own.\r\n\r\n“If you really want to know my name,” she said with the same expression\r\nof severity on her face, “I am called Fiekla.”\r\n\r\n“And I, Pemien,” Ostrodumov added in his bass voice.\r\n\r\n“How very instructive! Then tell me, Oh Fiekla! and you, Oh Pemien! why\r\nyou are so unfriendly, so persistently unfriendly to me when I—”\r\n\r\n“Mashurina thinks,” Ostrodumov interrupted him, “and not only Mashurina,\r\nthat you are not to be depended upon, because you always laugh at\r\neverything.”\r\n\r\nPaklin turned round on his heels.\r\n\r\n“That is the usual mistake people make about me, my dear Pemien! In the\r\nfirst place, I am not always laughing, and even if I were, that is no\r\nreason why you should not trust me. In the second, I have been flattered\r\nwith your confidence on more than one occasion before now, a convincing\r\nproof of my trustworthiness. I am an honest man, my dear Pemien.”\r\n\r\nOstrodumov muttered something between his teeth, but Paklin continued\r\nwithout the slightest trace of a smile on his face.\r\n\r\n“No, I am not always laughing! I am not at all a cheerful person. You\r\nhave only to look at me!”\r\n\r\nOstrodumov looked at him. And really, when Paklin was not laughing, when\r\nhe was silent, his face assumed a dejected, almost scared expression;\r\nit became funny and rather sarcastic only when he opened his lips.\r\nOstrodumov did not say anything, however, and Paklin turned to Mashurina\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n“Well? And how are your studies getting on? Have you made any\r\nprogress in your truly philanthropical art? Is it very hard to help an\r\ninexperienced citizen on his first appearance in this world?”\r\n\r\n“It is not at all hard if he happens to be no bigger than you are!”\r\n Mashurina retorted with a self-satisfied smile. (She had quite recently\r\npassed her examination as a midwife. Coming from a poor aristocratic\r\nfamily, she had left her home in the south of Russia about two years\r\nbefore, and with about twelve shillings in her pocket had arrived in\r\nMoscow, where she had entered a lying-in institution and had worked\r\nvery hard to gain the necessary certificate. She was unmarried and\r\nvery chaste.) “No wonder!” some sceptics may say (bearing in mind the\r\ndescription of her personal appearance; but we will permit ourselves to\r\nsay that it was wonderful and rare).\r\n\r\nPaklin laughed at her retort.\r\n\r\n“Well done, my dear! I feel quite crushed! But it serves me right for\r\nbeing such a dwarf! I wonder where our host has got to?”\r\n\r\nPaklin purposely changed the subject of conversation, which was rather a\r\nsore one to him. He could never resign himself to his small stature, nor\r\nindeed to the whole of his unprepossessing figure. He felt it all the\r\nmore because he was passionately fond of women and would have given\r\nanything to be attractive to them. The consciousness of his pitiful\r\nappearance was a much sorer point with him than his low origin and\r\nunenviable position in society. His father, a member of the lower middle\r\nclass, had, through all sorts of dishonest means, attained the rank of\r\ntitular councillor. He had been fairly successful as an intermediary\r\nin legal matters, and managed estates and house property. He had made a\r\nmoderate fortune, but had taken to drink towards the end of his life and\r\nhad left nothing after his death.\r\n\r\nYoung Paklin, he was called Sila—Sila Samsonitch, [Meaning strength,\r\nson of Samson] and always regarded this name as a joke against himself,\r\nwas educated in a commercial school, where he had acquired a good\r\nknowledge of German. After a great many difficulties he had entered\r\nan office, where he received a salary of five hundred roubles a year,\r\nout of which he had to keep himself, an invalid aunt, and a humpbacked\r\nsister. At the time of our story Paklin was twenty-eight years old.\r\nHe had a great many acquaintances among students and young people,\r\nwho liked him for his cynical wit, his harmless, though biting,\r\nself-confident speeches, his one-sided, unpedantic, though genuine,\r\nlearning, but occasionally they sat on him severely. Once, on arriving\r\nlate at a political meeting, he hastily began excusing himself. “Paklin\r\nwas afraid!” some one sang out from a corner of the room, and everyone\r\nlaughed. Paklin laughed with them, although it was like a stab in his\r\nheart. “He is right, the blackguard!” he thought to himself. Nejdanov\r\nhe had come across in a little Greek restaurant, where he was in the\r\nhabit of taking his dinner, and where he sat airing his rather free\r\nand audacious views. He assured everyone that the main cause of his\r\ndemocratic turn of mind was the bad Greek cooking, which upset his\r\nliver.\r\n\r\n“I wonder where our host has got to?” he repeated. “He has been out of\r\nsorts lately. Heaven forbid that he should be in love!”\r\n\r\nMashurina scowled.\r\n\r\n“He has gone to the library for books. As for falling in love, he has\r\nneither the time nor the opportunity.”\r\n\r\n“Why not with you?” almost escaped Paklin’s lips.\r\n\r\n“I should like to see him, because I have an important matter to talk\r\nover with him,” he said aloud.\r\n\r\n“What about?” Ostrodumov asked. “Our affairs?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps yours; that is, our common affairs.”\r\n\r\nOstrodumov hummed. He did not believe him. “Who knows? He’s such a busy\r\nbody,” he thought.\r\n\r\n“There he is at last!” Mashurina exclaimed suddenly, and her small\r\nunattractive eyes, fixed on the door, brightened, as if lit up by an\r\ninner ray, making them soft and warm and tender.\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and this time a young man of twenty-three, with a cap\r\non his head and a bundle of books under his arm, entered the room. It\r\nwas Nejdanov himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nAt the sight of visitors he stopped in the doorway, took them in at a\r\nglance, threw off his cap, dropped the books on to the floor, walked\r\nover to the bed, and sat down on the very edge. An expression of\r\nannoyance and displeasure passed over his pale handsome face, which\r\nseemed even paler than it really was, in contrast to his dark-red, wavy\r\nhair.\r\n\r\nMashurina turned away and bit her lip; Ostrodumov muttered, “At last!”\r\n\r\nPaklin was the first to approach him.\r\n\r\n“Why, what is the matter, Alexai Dmitritch, Hamlet of Russia? Has\r\nsomething happened, or are you just simply depressed, without any\r\nparticular cause?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, stop! Mephistopheles of Russia!” Nejdanov exclaimed irritably. “I\r\nam not in the mood for fencing with blunt witticisms just now.”\r\n\r\nPaklin laughed.\r\n\r\n“That’s not quite correct. If it is wit, then it can’t be blunt. If\r\nblunt, then it can’t be wit.”\r\n\r\n“All right, all right! We know you are clever!”\r\n\r\n“Your nerves are out of order,” Paklin remarked hesitatingly. “Or has\r\nsomething really happened?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, nothing in particular, only that it is impossible to show one’s\r\nnose in this hateful town without knocking against some vulgarity,\r\nstupidity, tittle-tattle, or some horrible injustice. One can’t live\r\nhere any longer!”\r\n\r\n“Is that why your advertisement in the papers says that you want a place\r\nand have no objection to leaving St. Petersburg?” Ostrodumov asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes. I would go away from here with the greatest of pleasure, if some\r\nfool could be found who would offer me a place!”\r\n\r\n“You should first fulfill your duties here,” Mashurina remarked\r\nsignificantly, her face still turned away.\r\n\r\n“What duties?” Nejdanov asked, turning towards her.\r\n\r\nMashurina bit her lip. “Ask Ostrodumov.”\r\n\r\nNejdanov turned to Ostrodumov. The latter hummed and hawed, as if to\r\nsay, “Wait a minute.”\r\n\r\n“But seriously,” Paklin broke in, “have you heard any unpleasant news?”\r\n\r\nNejdanov bounced up from the bed like an india-rubber ball. “What more\r\ndo you want?” he shouted out suddenly, in a ringing voice. “Half of\r\nRussia is dying of hunger! The Moscow News is triumphant! They want\r\nto introduce classicism, the students’ benefit clubs have been closed,\r\nspies everywhere, oppression, lies, betrayals, deceit! And it is not\r\nenough for him! He wants some new unpleasantness! He thinks that I am\r\njoking.... Basanov has been arrested,” he added, lowering his voice. “I\r\nheard it at the library.”\r\n\r\nMashurina and Ostrodumov lifted their heads simultaneously.\r\n\r\n“My dear Alexai Dmitritch,” Paklin began, “you are upset, and for a very\r\ngood reason. But have you forgotten in what times and in what country we\r\nare living? Amongst us a drowning man must himself create the straw to\r\nclutch at. Why be sentimental over it? One must look the devil straight\r\nin the face and not get excited like children—”\r\n\r\n“Oh, don’t, please!” Nejdanov interrupted him desperately, frowning as\r\nif in pain. “We know you are energetic and not afraid of anything—”\r\n\r\n“I—not afraid of anything?” Paklin began.\r\n\r\n“I wonder who could have betrayed Basanov?” Nejdanov continued. “I\r\nsimply can’t understand!”\r\n\r\n“A friend no doubt. Friends are great at that. One must look alive! I\r\nonce had a friend, who seemed a good fellow; he was always concerned\r\nabout me and my reputation. ‘I say, what dreadful stories are being\r\ncirculated about you!’ he would greet me one day. ‘They say that you\r\npoisoned your uncle and that on one occasion, when you were introduced\r\ninto a certain house, you sat the whole evening with your back to the\r\nhostess and that she was so upset that she cried at the insult! What\r\nawful nonsense! What fools could possibly believe such things!’ Well,\r\nand what do you think? A year after I quarrelled with this same friend,\r\nand in his farewell letter to me he wrote, ‘You who killed your own\r\nuncle! You who were not ashamed to insult an honourable lady by sitting\r\nwith your back to her,’ and so on and so on. Here are friends for you!”\r\n\r\nOstrodumov and Mashurina exchanged glances.\r\n\r\n“Alexai Dmitritch!” Ostrodumov exclaimed in his heavy bass voice; he was\r\nevidently anxious to avoid a useless discussion. “A letter has come from\r\nMoscow, from Vassily Nikolaevitch.”\r\n\r\nNejdanov trembled slightly and cast down his eyes.\r\n\r\n“What does he say?” he asked at last.\r\n\r\n“He wants us to go there with her.” Ostrodumov indicated to Mashurina\r\nwith his eyebrows.\r\n\r\n“Do they want her too?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Well, what’s the difficulty?”\r\n\r\n“Why, money, of course.”\r\n\r\nNejdanov got up from the bed and walked over to the window.\r\n\r\n“How much do you want?”\r\n\r\n“Not less than fifty roubles.”\r\n\r\nNejdanov was silent.\r\n\r\n“I have no money just now,” he whispered at last, drumming his fingers\r\non the window pane, “but I could get some. Have you got the letter?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, it... that is... certainly....”\r\n\r\n“Why are you always trying to keep things from me?” Paklin exclaimed.\r\n“Have I not deserved your confidence? Even if I were not fully in\r\nsympathy with what you are undertaking, do you think for a moment that I\r\nam in a position to turn around or gossip?”\r\n\r\n“Without intending to, perhaps,” Ostrodumov remarked.\r\n\r\n“Neither with nor without intention! Miss Mashurina is looking at me\r\nwith a smile... but I say—”\r\n\r\n“I am not smiling!” Mashurina burst out.\r\n\r\n“But I say,” Paklin went on, “that you have no tact. You are utterly\r\nincapable of recognising your real friends. If a man can laugh, then you\r\nthink that he can’t be serious—”\r\n\r\n“Is it not so?” Mashurina snapped.\r\n\r\n“You are in need of money, for instance,” Paklin continued with new\r\nforce, paying no attention to Mashurina; “Nejdanov hasn’t any. I could\r\nget it for you.”\r\n\r\nNejdanov wheeled round from the window.\r\n\r\n“No, no. It is not necessary. I can get the money. I will draw some of\r\nmy allowance in advance. Now I recollect, they owe me something. Let us\r\nlook at the letter, Ostrodumov.”\r\n\r\nOstrodumov remained motionless for a time, then he looked around, stood\r\nup, bent down, turned up one of the legs of his trousers, and carefully\r\npulled a piece of blue paper out of his high boot, blew at it for some\r\nreason or another, and handed it to Nejdanov. The latter took the piece\r\nof paper, unfolded it, read it carefully, and passed it on to Mashurina.\r\nShe stood up, also read it, and handed it back to Nejdanov, although\r\nPaklin had extended his hand for it. Nejdanov shrugged his shoulders and\r\ngave the secret letter to Paklin. The latter scanned the paper in his\r\nturn, pressed his lips together significantly, and laid it solemnly on\r\nthe table. Ostrodumov took it, lit a large match, which exhaled a strong\r\nodour of sulphur, lifted the paper high above his head, as if showing it\r\nto all present, set fire to it, and, regardless of his fingers, put\r\nthe ashes into the stove. No one moved or pronounced a word during this\r\nproceeding; all had their eyes fixed on the floor. Ostrodumov looked\r\nconcentrated and business-like, Nejdanov furious, Paklin intense, and\r\nMashurina as if she were present at holy mass.\r\n\r\nAbout two minutes went by in this way, everyone feeling uncomfortable.\r\nPaklin was the first to break the silence.\r\n\r\n“Well?” he began. “Is my sacrifice to be received on the altar of the\r\nfatherland? Am I permitted to bring, if not the whole at any rate,\r\ntwenty-five or thirty roubles for the common cause?”\r\n\r\nNejdanov flared up. He seemed to be boiling over with annoyance, which\r\nwas not lessened by the solemn burning of the letter—he was only\r\nwaiting for an opportunity to burst out.\r\n\r\n“I tell you that I don’t want it, don’t want, don’t want it! I’ll not\r\nallow it and I’ll not take it! I can get the money. I can get it at\r\nonce. I am not in need of anyone’s help!”\r\n\r\n“My dear Alexai,” Paklin remarked, “I see that you are not a democrat in\r\nspite of your being a revolutionist!”\r\n\r\n“Why not say straight out that I’m an aristocrat?”\r\n\r\n“So you are up to a certain point.”\r\n\r\nNejdanov gave a forced laugh.\r\n\r\n“I see you are hinting at the fact of my being illegitimate. You can\r\nsave yourself the trouble, my dear boy. I am not likely to forget it.”\r\n\r\nPaklin threw up his arms in despair.\r\n\r\n“Aliosha! What is the matter with you? How can you twist my words so? I\r\nhardly know you today.”\r\n\r\nNejdanov shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n“Basanov’s arrest has upset you, but he was so careless—”\r\n\r\n“He did not hide his convictions,” Mashurina put in gloomily. “It is not\r\nfor us to sit in judgment upon him!”\r\n\r\n“Quite so; only he might have had a little more consideration for\r\nothers, who are likely to be compromised through him now.”\r\n\r\n“What makes you think so?” Ostrodumov bawled out in his turn. “Basanov\r\nhas plenty of character, he will not betray anyone. Besides, not every\r\none can be cautious you know, Mr. Paklin.”\r\n\r\nPaklin was offended and was about to say something when Nejdanov\r\ninterrupted him.\r\n\r\n“I vote we leave politics for a time, ladies and gentlemen!” he\r\nexclaimed.\r\n\r\nA silence ensued.\r\n\r\n“I ran across Skoropikin today,” Paklin was the first to begin. “Our\r\ngreat national critic, aesthetic, and enthusiast! What an insufferable\r\ncreature! He is forever boiling and frothing over like a bottle of sour\r\nkvas. A waiter runs with it, his finger stuck in the bottle instead of\r\na cork, a fat raisin in the neck, and when it has done frothing and\r\nfoaming there is nothing left at the bottom but a few drops of some\r\nnasty stuff, which far from quenching any one’s thirst is enough to\r\nmake one ill. He’s a most dangerous person for young people to come in\r\ncontact with.”\r\n\r\nPaklin’s true and rather apt comparison raised no smile on his\r\nlisteners’ faces, only Nejdanov remarked that if young people were\r\nfools enough to interest themselves in aesthetics, they deserved no pity\r\nwhatever, even if Skoropikin did lead them astray.\r\n\r\n“Of course,” Paklin exclaimed with some warmth—the less sympathy he met\r\nwith, the more heated he became—“I admit that the question is not\r\na political one, but an important one, nevertheless. According to\r\nSkoropikin, every ancient work of art is valueless because it is old. If\r\nthat were true, then art would be reduced to nothing more or less than\r\nmere fashion. A preposterous idea, not worth entertaining. If art has\r\nno firmer foundation than that, if it is not eternal, then it is utterly\r\nuseless. Take science, for instance. In mathematics do you look upon\r\nEuler, Laplace, or Gauss as fools? Of course not. You accept their\r\nauthority. Then why question the authority of Raphael and Mozart? I must\r\nadmit, however, that the laws of art are far more difficult to define\r\nthan the laws of nature, but they exist just the same, and he who fails\r\nto see them is blind, whether he shuts his eyes to them purposely or\r\nnot.”\r\n\r\nPaklin ceased, but no one uttered a word. They all sat with tightly\r\nclosed mouths as if feeling unutterably sorry for him.\r\n\r\n“All the same,” Ostrodumov remarked, “I am not in the least sorry for\r\nthe young people who run after Skoropikin.”\r\n\r\n“You are hopeless,” Paklin thought. “I had better be going.”\r\n\r\nHe went up to Nejdanov, intending to ask his opinion about smuggling\r\nin the magazine, the “Polar Star”, from abroad (the “Bell” had already\r\nceased to exist), but the conversation took such a turn that it was\r\nimpossible to raise the question. Paklin had already taken up his hat,\r\nwhen suddenly, without the slightest warning, a wonderfully pleasant,\r\nmanly baritone was heard from the passage. The very sound of this voice\r\nsuggested something gentle, fresh, and well-bred.\r\n\r\n“Is Mr. Nejdanov at home?”\r\n\r\nThey all looked at one another in amazement.\r\n\r\n“Is Mr. Nejdanov at home?” the baritone repeated.\r\n\r\n“Yes, he is,” Nejdanov replied at last.\r\n\r\nThe door opened gently and a man of about forty entered the room and\r\nslowly removed his glossy hat from his handsome, closely cropped head.\r\nHe was tall and well-made, and dressed in a beautiful cloth coat with\r\na gorgeous beaver collar, although it was already the end of April. He\r\nimpressed Nejdanov and Paklin, and even Mashurina and Ostrodumov,\r\nwith his elegant, easy carriage and courteous manner. They all rose\r\ninstinctively on his entrance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThe elegantly dressed man went up to Nejdanov with an amiable smile\r\nand began: “I have already had the pleasure of meeting you and even\r\nspeaking to you, Mr. Nejdanov, the day before yesterday, if you\r\nremember, at the theatre.” (The visitor paused, as though waiting for\r\nNejdanov to make some remark, but the latter merely bowed slightly and\r\nblushed.) “I have come to see you about your advertisement, which I\r\nnoticed in the paper. I should like us to have a talk if your visitors\r\nwould not mind....” (He bowed to Mashurina, and waved a grey-gloved\r\nhand in the direction of Paklin and Ostrodumov.)\r\n\r\n“Not at all,” Nejdanov replied awkwardly. “Won’t you sit down?”\r\n\r\nThe visitor bowed from the waist, drew a chair to himself, but did not\r\nsit down, as every one else was standing. He merely gazed around the\r\nroom with his bright though half-closed eyes.\r\n\r\n“Goodbye, Alexai Dmitritch,” Mashurina exclaimed suddenly. “I will come\r\nagain presently.”\r\n\r\n“And I too,” Ostrodumov added.\r\n\r\nMashurina did not take the slightest notice of the visitor as she passed\r\nhim, but went straight up to Nejdanov, gave him a hearty shake of the\r\nhand, and left the room without bowing to anyone. Ostrodumov followed\r\nher, making an unnecessary noise with his boots, and snorting out once\r\nor twice contemptuously, “There’s a beaver collar for you!”\r\n\r\nThe visitor accompanied them with a polite though slightly inquisitive\r\nlook, and then directed his gaze to Paklin, hoping the latter would\r\nfollow their example, but Paklin withdrew into a corner and settled\r\ndown. A peculiarly suppressed smile played on his lips ever since the\r\nappearance of the stranger. The visitor and Nejdanov also sat down.\r\n\r\n“My name is Sipiagin. You may perhaps have heard of me,” the visitor\r\nbegan with modest pride.\r\n\r\nWe must first relate how Nejdanov had met him at the theatre.\r\n\r\nThere had been a performance of Ostrovsky’s play “Never Sit in Another\r\nMan’s Sledge”, on the occasion of the great actor Sadovsky’s coming from\r\nMoscow. Rusakov, one of the characters in the play, was known to be one\r\nof his favourite parts. Just before dinner on that day, Nejdanov went\r\ndown to the theatre to book a ticket, but found a large crowd already\r\nwaiting there. He walked up to the desk with the intention of getting a\r\nticket for the pit, when an officer, who happened to be standing behind\r\nhim, thrust a three-rouble note over Nejdanov’s head and called out to\r\nthe man inside: “He” (meaning Nejdanov) “will probably want change. I\r\ndon’t. Give me a ticket for the stalls, please. Make haste, I’m in a\r\nhurry!”\r\n\r\n“Excuse me, sir, I want a ticket for the stalls myself!” Nejdanov\r\nexclaimed, throwing down a three-rouble note, all the ready money\r\nhe possessed. He got his ticket, and in the evening appeared in the\r\naristocratic part of the Alexandrinsky Theatre.\r\n\r\nHe was badly dressed, without gloves and in dirty boots. He was\r\nuncomfortable and angry with himself for feeling uncomfortable. A\r\ngeneral with numerous orders glittering on his breast sat on his right,\r\nand on his left this same elegant Sipiagin, whose appearance two days\r\nlater at Nejdanov’s so astonished Mashurina and Ostrodumov. The general\r\nstared at Nejdanov every now and again, as though at something indecent,\r\nout of place, and offensive. Sipiagin looked at him sideways, but did\r\nnot seem unfriendly. All the people surrounding him were evidently\r\npersonages of some importance, and as they all knew one another, they\r\nkept exchanging remarks, exclamations, greetings, occasionally even over\r\nNejdanov’s head. He sat there motionless and ill at ease in his spacious\r\narmchair, feeling like an outcast. Ostrovsky’s play and Sadovsky’s\r\nacting afforded him but little pleasure, and he felt bitter at heart.\r\nWhen suddenly, Oh wonder! During one of the intervals, his neighbour\r\non the left, not the glittering general, but the other with no marks\r\nof distinction on his breast, addressed him politely and kindly, but\r\nsomewhat timidly. He asked him what he thought of Ostrovsky’s play,\r\nwanted to know his opinion of it as a representative of the new\r\ngeneration. Nejdanov, overwhelmed and half frightened, his heart beating\r\nfast, answered at first curtly, in monosyllables, but soon began to be\r\nannoyed with his own excitement. “After all,” he thought, “am I not\r\na man like everybody else?” And began expressing his opinions quite\r\nfreely, without any restraint. He got so carried away by his subject,\r\nand spoke so loudly, that he quite alarmed the order-bedecked general.\r\nNejdanov was a strong admirer of Ostrovsky, but could not help feeling,\r\nin spite of the author’s great genius, his evident desire to throw a\r\nslur on modern civilisation in the burlesqued character of Veherov, in\r\n“Never Sit in Another Man’s Sledge”.\r\n\r\nHis polite neighbour listened to him attentively, evidently interested\r\nin what he said. He spoke to him again in the next interval, not about\r\nthe play this time, but about various matters of everyday life, about\r\nscience, and even touched upon political questions. He was decidedly\r\ninterested in his eloquent young companion. Nejdanov did not feel in\r\nthe least constrained as before, but even began to assume airs, as if\r\nsaying, “If you really want to know, I can satisfy your curiosity!” The\r\ngeneral’s annoyance grew to indignation and even suspicion.\r\n\r\nAfter the play Sipiagin took leave of Nejdanov very courteously, but did\r\nnot ask his name, neither did he tell him his own. While waiting for his\r\ncarriage, he ran against a friend, a certain Prince G., an aide-de-camp.\r\n\r\n“I watched you from my box,” the latter remarked, through a perfumed\r\nmoustache. “Do you know whom you were speaking to?”\r\n\r\n“No. Do you? A rather clever chap. Who is he?”\r\n\r\nThe prince whispered in his ear in French. “He is my brother...\r\nillegitimate.... His name is Nejdanov. I will tell you all about it\r\nsomeday. My father did not in the least expect that sort of thing,\r\nthat was why he called him Nejdanov. [The unexpected.] But he looked\r\nafter him all right. Il lui a fait un sort. We make him an allowance\r\nto live on. He is not stupid. Had quite a good education, thanks to my\r\nfather. But he has gone quite off the track—I think he’s a republican.\r\nWe refuse to have anything to do with him. Il est impossible. Goodbye,\r\nI see my carriage is waiting.”\r\n\r\nThe prince separated.\r\n\r\nThe next day Sipiagin noticed Nejdanov’s advertisement in the paper and\r\nwent to see him.\r\n\r\n“My name is Sipiagin,” he repeated, as he sat in front of Nejdanov,\r\nsurveying him with a dignified air. “I see by your advertisement that\r\nyou are looking for a post, and I should like to know if you would be\r\nwilling to come to me. I am married and have a boy of eight, a very\r\nintelligent child, I may say. We usually spend the summer and autumn in\r\nthe country, in the province of S., about five miles from the town of\r\nthat name. I should like you to come to us for the vacation to teach\r\nmy boy Russian history and grammar. I think those were the subjects you\r\nmentioned in your advertisement. I think you will get on with us all\r\nright, and I am sure you will like the neighbourhood. We have a large\r\nhouse and garden, the air is excellent, and there is a river close\r\nby. Well, would you like to come? We shall only have to come to terms,\r\nalthough I do not think,” he added, with a slight grimace, “that there\r\nwill be any difficulty on that point between us.”\r\n\r\nNejdanov watched Sipiagin all the time he was speaking. He gazed at his\r\nsmall head, bent a little to one side, his low, narrow, but intelligent\r\nforehead, his fine Roman nose, pleasant eyes, straight lips, out of\r\nwhich his words flowed graciously; he gazed at his drooping whiskers,\r\nkept in the English fashion, gazed and wondered. “What does it all\r\nmean?” he asked himself. “Why has this man come to seek me out? This\r\naristocrat and I! What have we in common? What does he see in me?”\r\n\r\nHe was so lost in thought that he did not open his lips when Sipiagin,\r\nhaving finished speaking, evidently awaited an answer. Sipiagin cast a\r\nlook into the corner where Paklin sat, also watching him. “Perhaps the\r\npresence of a third person prevents him from saying what he would\r\nlike,” flashed across Sipiagin’s mind. He raised his eyebrows, as if in\r\nsubmission to the strangeness of the surroundings he had come to of his\r\nown accord, and repeated his question a second time.\r\n\r\nNejdanov started.\r\n\r\n“Of course,” he began hurriedly, “I should like to... with\r\npleasure... only I must confess... I am rather surprised... having no\r\nrecommendations... and the views I expressed at the theatre were more\r\ncalculated to prejudice you—”\r\n\r\n“There you are quite mistaken Alexai—Alexai Dmitritch—have I got the\r\nname right?” Sipiagin asked with a smile. “I may venture to say that I\r\nam well known for my liberal and progressive opinions. On the contrary,\r\nwhat you said the other evening, with the exception perhaps of any\r\nyouthful characteristics, which are always rather given to exaggeration,\r\nif you will excuse my saying so, I fully agreed with, and was even\r\ndelighted with your enthusiasm.”\r\n\r\nSipiagin spoke without the slightest hesitation, his words flowing from\r\nhim as a stream.\r\n\r\n“My wife shares my way of thinking,” he continued, “her views are,\r\nif anything, more like yours than mine, which is not surprising,\r\nconsidering that she is younger than I am. When I read your name in the\r\npaper the day after our meeting—and by the way, you announced your name\r\nand address contrary to the usual custom—I was rather struck by the\r\ncoincidence, having already heard it at the theatre. It seemed to\r\nme like the finger of fate. Excuse my being so superstitious. As for\r\nrecommendations, I do not think they are necessary in this case. I, like\r\nyou, am accustomed to trusting my intuition. May I hope that you will\r\ncome?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I will come,” Nejdanov replied, “and will try to be worthy of your\r\nconfidence. But there is one thing I should like to mention. I could\r\nundertake to teach your boy, but am not prepared to look after him. I do\r\nnot wish to undertake anything that would interfere with my freedom.”\r\n\r\nSipiagin gave a slight wave of the hand, as if driving away a fly.\r\n\r\n“You may be easy on that point. You are not made that way. I only wanted\r\na tutor, and I have found one. Well, now, how about terms? Financial\r\nterms, that is. Base metal!”\r\n\r\nNejdanov did not know what to say.\r\n\r\n“I think,” Sipiagin went on, bending forward and touching Nejdanov with\r\nthe tips of his fingers, “that decent people can settle such things in\r\ntwo words. I will give you a hundred roubles a month and all travelling\r\nexpenses. Will you come?”\r\n\r\nNejdanov blushed.\r\n\r\n“That is more than I wanted to ask... because I—”\r\n\r\n“Well,” Sipiagin interrupted him, “I look upon the matter as settled,\r\nand consider you as a member of our household.” He rose from his\r\nchair, and became quite gay and expansive, as if he had just received a\r\npresent. A certain amiable familiarity, verging on the playful, began to\r\nshow itself in all his gestures. “We shall set out in a day or two,” he\r\nwent on, in an easy tone. “There is nothing I love better than meeting\r\nspring in the country, although I am a busy, prosaic sort of person,\r\ntied to town.... I want you to count your first month as beginning from\r\ntoday. My wife and boy have already started, and are probably in Moscow\r\nby now. We shall find them in the lap of nature. We will go alone, like\r\ntwo bachelors, ha, ha!” Sipiagin laughed coquettishly, through his nose.\r\n“And now—”\r\n\r\nHe took a black and silver pocketbook out of his overcoat pocket and\r\npulled out a card.\r\n\r\n“This is my address. Come and see me tomorrow at about twelve o’clock.\r\nWe can talk things over further. I should like to tell you a few of my\r\nviews on education. We can also decide when to start.”\r\n\r\nSipiagin took Nejdanov’s hand. “By the way,” he said, lowering his voice\r\nand bending his head a little to one side, “if you are in need of money,\r\nplease do not stand on ceremony. I can let you have a month’s pay in\r\nadvance.”\r\n\r\nNejdanov was at a loss to know what to say. He gazed, with the same\r\npuzzled expression, at the kind, bright face, which was so strange yet\r\nso close to him, smiling encouragingly.\r\n\r\n“You are not in need of any?” Sipiagin asked in a whisper.\r\n\r\n“I will tell you tomorrow, if I may,” Nejdanov said at last.\r\n\r\n“Well, goodbye, then. Till tomorrow.” Sipiagin dropped Nejdanov’s hand\r\nand turned to go out.\r\n\r\n“I should like to know,” Nejdanov asked suddenly, “who told you my name?\r\nYou said you heard it at the theatre.”\r\n\r\n“Someone who is very well known to you. A relative of yours, I think.\r\nPrince G.”\r\n\r\n“The aide-de-camp?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nNejdanov flushed even redder than before, but did not say anything.\r\nSipiagin shook his hand again, without a word this time, then bowing\r\nfirst to him and then to Paklin, put on his hat at the door, and\r\nwent out with a self-satisfied smile on his lips, denoting the deep\r\nimpression the visit must have produced upon him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nSipiagin had barely crossed the threshold when Paklin jumped up, and\r\nrushing across to Nejdanov began showering congratulations upon him.\r\n\r\n“What a fine catch!” he exclaimed laughing, scarcely able to stand\r\nstill. “Do you know who he is? He’s quite a celebrity, a chamberlain,\r\none of our pillars of society, a future minister!”\r\n\r\n“I have never heard of him,” Nejdanov remarked dejectedly.\r\n\r\nPaklin threw up his arms in despair.\r\n\r\n“That’s just where we are mistaken, Alexai Dmitritch! We never know\r\nanyone. We want to do things, to turn the whole world upside down,\r\nand are living outside this very world, amidst two or three friends,\r\njostling each other in our narrow little circle!”\r\n\r\n“Excuse me,” Nejdanov put in. “I don’t think that is quite true. We\r\ncertainly do not go amongst the enemy, but are constantly mixing with\r\nour own kind, and with the masses.”\r\n\r\n“Just a minute!” Paklin interrupted, in his turn. “Talking of enemies\r\nreminds me of Goethe’s lines—\r\n\r\n  _Wer den Dichter will versteh’n Muss im Dichter’s lande geh’n._\r\n\r\nand I say—\r\n\r\n  _Wer den Feinde will versteh’n Muss im Feinde’s lande geh’n._\r\n\r\nTo turn one’s back on one’s enemies, not to try and understand their\r\nmanner of life, is utterly stupid! Yes, utterly stu-pid! If I want to\r\nshoot a wolf in the forest, I must first find out his haunts. You talked\r\nof coming in contact with the people just now. My dear boy! In 1862 the\r\nPoles formed their revolutionary bands in the forest; we are just about\r\nto enter that same forest, I mean the people, where it is no less dark\r\nand dense than in the other.”\r\n\r\n“Then what would you have us do?”\r\n\r\n“The Hindus cast themselves under the wheels of the Juggernaut,” Paklin\r\ncontinued; “they were mangled to pieces and died in ecstasy. We, also,\r\nhave our Juggernaut—it crushes and mangles us, but there is no ecstasy\r\nin it.”\r\n\r\n“Then what would you have us do?” Nejdanov almost screamed at him.\r\n“Would you have us write preachy novels?”\r\n\r\nPaklin folded his arms and put his head on one side.\r\n\r\n“You, at any rate, could write novels. You have a decidedly literary\r\nturn of mind. All right, I won’t say anything about it. I know you don’t\r\nlike it being mentioned. I know it is not very exciting to write the\r\nsort of stuff wanted, and in the modern style too. ‘“Oh, I love you,”\r\n she bounded—’”\r\n\r\n“It’s all the same to me,” he replied, scratching himself.\r\n\r\n“That is precisely why I advise you to get to know all sorts and\r\nconditions, beginning from the very highest. We must not be entirely\r\ndependent on people like Ostrodumov! They are very honest, worthy folk,\r\nbut so hopelessly stupid! You need only look at our friend. The very\r\nsoles of his boots are not like those worn by intelligent people. Why\r\ndid he hurry away just now? Only because he did not want to be in the\r\nsame room with an aristocrat, to breathe the same air—”\r\n\r\n“Please don’t talk like that about Ostrodumov before me!” Nejdanov burst\r\nout. “He wears thick boots because they are cheaper!”\r\n\r\n“I did not mean it in that sense,” Paklin began.\r\n\r\n“If he did not wish to remain in the same room with an aristocrat,”\r\n Nejdanov continued, raising his voice, “I think it very praiseworthy on\r\nhis part, and what is more, he is capable of sacrificing himself, will\r\nface death, if necessary, which is more than you or I will ever do!”\r\n\r\nPaklin made a sad grimace, and pointed to his scraggy, crippled legs.\r\n\r\n“Now do I look like a warrior, my dear Alexai Dmitritch? But enough of\r\nthis. I am delighted that you met this Sipiagin, and can even foresee\r\nsomething useful to our cause as a result of it. You will find yourself\r\nin the highest society, will come in contact with those wonderful\r\nbeauties one hears about, women with velvety bodies on steel springs, as\r\nit says in ‘Letters on Spain’. Get to know them, my dear fellow. If you\r\nwere at all inclined to be an Epicurean, I should really be afraid to\r\nlet you go. But those are not the objects with which you are going, are\r\nthey?”\r\n\r\n“I am going away,” Nejdanov said, “to earn my living. And to get away\r\nfrom you all,” he added to himself.\r\n\r\n“Of course, of course! That is why I advise you to learn. Fugh! What a\r\nsmell this gentleman has left behind him!” Paklin sniffed the air. “The\r\nvery ambrosia that the governor’s wife longed for in Gogol’s ‘Revisor’!”\r\n\r\n“He discussed me with Prince G.,” Nejdanov remarked dejectedly. “I\r\nsuppose he knows my whole history now.”\r\n\r\n“You need not suppose; you may be quite sure of it! But what does it\r\nmatter? I wouldn’t mind betting that that was the very reason for his\r\nwanting to engage you. You will be able to hold your own with the best\r\nof them. You are an aristocrat yourself by blood, and consequently\r\nan equal. However, I have stayed too long. I must go back to the\r\nexploiter’s, to my office. Goodbye.”\r\n\r\nPaklin went to the door, but stopped and turned back.\r\n\r\n“I say, Aliosha,” he began in a persuasive tone of voice, “you have only\r\njust refused me, and I know you will not be short of money now; but, all\r\nthe same, do allow me to sacrifice just a little for the cause. I can’t\r\ndo anything else, so let me help with my pocket! I have put ten roubles\r\non the table. Will you take them?”\r\n\r\nNejdanov remained motionless, and did not say anything. “Silence means\r\nconsent! Thanks!” Paklin exclaimed gaily and vanished.\r\n\r\nNejdanov was left alone. He continued gazing out into the narrow, gloomy\r\ncourt, unpenetrated by the sun even in summer, and he felt sad and\r\ngloomy at heart.\r\n\r\nWe already know that Nejdanov’s father was Prince G., a rich\r\nadjutant-general. His mother was the daughter of the general’s\r\ngoverness, a pretty girl who died on the day of Nejdanov’s birth. He\r\nreceived his early education in a boarding school kept by a certain\r\nSwiss, a very energetic and severe pedagogue, after which he entered the\r\nuniversity. His great ambition was to study law, but his father, who\r\nhad a violent hatred for nihilists, made him go in for history and\r\nphilology, or for “aesthetics” as Nejdanov put it with a bitter smile.\r\nHis father used to see him about four times a year in all, but was,\r\nnevertheless, interested in his welfare, and when he died, left him a\r\nsum of six thousand roubles “in memory of Nastinka” his mother. Nejdanov\r\nreceived the interest on this money from his brothers the Princes G.,\r\nwhich they were pleased to call an allowance.\r\n\r\nPaklin had good reason to call him an aristocrat. Everything about him\r\nbetokened his origin. His tiny ears, hands, feet, his small but fine\r\nfeatures, delicate skin, wavy hair; his very voice was pleasant,\r\nalthough it was slightly guttural. He was highly strung, frightfully\r\nconceited, very susceptible, and even capricious. The false position he\r\nhad been placed in from childhood had made him sensitive and irritable,\r\nbut his natural generosity had kept him from becoming suspicious\r\nand mistrustful. This same false position was the cause of an utter\r\ninconsistency, which permeated his whole being. He was fastidiously\r\naccurate and horribly squeamish, tried to be cynical and coarse in\r\nhis speech, but was an idealist by nature. He was passionate and\r\npure-minded, bold and timid at the same time, and, like a repentant\r\nsinner, ashamed of his sins; he was ashamed alike of his timidity and\r\nhis purity, and considered it his duty to scoff at all idealism. He had\r\nan affectionate heart, but held himself aloof from everybody, was easily\r\nexasperated, but never bore ill-will. He was furious with his father\r\nfor having made him take up “aesthetics,” openly interested himself in\r\npolitics and social questions, professed the most extreme views (which\r\nmeant more to him than mere words), but secretly took a delight in art,\r\npoetry, beauty in all its manifestations, and in his inspired moments\r\nwrote verses. It is true that he carefully hid the copy-book in which\r\nthey were written, and none of his St. Petersburg friends, with\r\nthe exception of Paklin, and he only by his peculiar intuitiveness,\r\nsuspected its existence. Nothing hurt or offended Nejdanov more than the\r\nsmallest allusion to his poetry, which he regarded as an unpardonable\r\nweakness in himself. His Swiss schoolmaster had taught him a great many\r\nthings, and he was not afraid of hard work. He applied himself readily\r\nand zealously, but did not work consecutively. All his friends loved\r\nhim. They were attracted by his natural sense of justice, his kindness,\r\nand his pure-mindedness, but Nejdanov was not born under a lucky star,\r\nand did not find life an easy matter. He was fully conscious of this\r\nfact and felt utterly lonely in spite of the untiring devotion of his\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nHe stood meditating at the window. Sad, oppressive thoughts rose up in\r\nhis mind one after another about the prospective journey, the new and\r\nunexpected change that was coming into his life. He had no regrets at\r\nthe thought of leaving St. Petersburg, as he would leave nothing behind\r\nthat was especially dear to him, and he knew that he would be back in\r\nthe autumn; but he was pervaded by the spirit of indecision, and an\r\ninvoluntary melancholy came over him.\r\n\r\n“A fine tutor I shall make!” flashed across his mind. “Am I cut out for\r\na schoolmaster?” He was ready to reproach himself for having undertaken\r\nthe duties of a tutor, and would have been unjust in doing so. Nejdanov\r\nwas sufficiently cultured, and, in spite of his uncertain temperament,\r\nchildren grew readily fond of him and he of them. His depression was\r\ndue to that feeling which takes possession of one before any change\r\nof place, a feeling experienced by all melancholy, dreaming people and\r\nunknown to those of energetic, sanguine temperaments, who always rejoice\r\nat any break in the humdrum of their daily existence, and welcome a\r\nchange of abode with pleasure. Nejdanov was so lost in his meditations\r\nthat his thoughts began quite unconsciously to take the form of words.\r\nHis wandering sensations began to arrange themselves into measured\r\ncadences.\r\n\r\n“Damn!” he exclaimed aloud. “I’m wandering off into poetry!” He shook\r\nhimself and turned away from the window. He caught sight of Paklin’s\r\nten-rouble note, put it in his pocket, and began pacing up and down the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n“I must get some money in advance,” he thought to himself. “What a good\r\nthing this gentleman suggested it. A hundred roubles... a hundred from\r\nmy brothers—their excellencies.... I want fifty to pay my debts, fifty\r\nor seventy for the journey—and the rest Ostrodumov can have. Then there\r\nare Paklin’s ten roubles in addition, and I dare say I can get something\r\nfrom Merkulov—”\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these calculations the rhythmic cadences began to\r\nreassert themselves. He stood still, as if rooted to the spot, with\r\nfixed gaze. After a while his hands involuntarily found their way to the\r\ntable drawer, from which he pulled out a much-used copy-book. He dropped\r\ninto a chair with the same fixed look, humming softly to himself and\r\nevery now and again shaking back his wavy hair, began writing line after\r\nline, sometimes scratching out and rewriting.\r\n\r\nThe door leading into the passage opened slightly and Mashurina’s head\r\nappeared. Nejdanov did not notice her and went on writing. Mashurina\r\nstood looking at him intently for some time, shook her head, and drew\r\nit back again. Nejdanov sat up straight, and suddenly catching sight of\r\nher, exclaimed with some annoyance: “Oh, is that you?” and thrust the\r\ncopy-book into the drawer again.\r\n\r\nMashurina came into the room with a firm step.\r\n\r\n“Ostrodumov asked me to come,” she began deliberately.\r\n\r\n“He would like to know when we can have the money. If you could get it\r\ntoday, we could start this evening.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t get it today,” Nejdanov said with a frown. “Please come\r\ntomorrow.”\r\n\r\n“At what time?”\r\n\r\n“Two o’clock.”\r\n\r\n“Very well.”\r\n\r\nMashurina was silent for a while and then extended her hand.\r\n\r\n“I am afraid I interrupted you. I am so sorry. But then... I am going\r\naway... who knows if we shall ever meet again.... I wanted to say\r\ngoodbye to you.”\r\n\r\nNejdanov pressed her cold, red fingers. “You know the man who was here\r\ntoday,” he began. “I have come to terms with him, and am going with him.\r\nHis place is down in the province of S., not far from the town itself.”\r\n\r\nA glad smile lit up Mashurina’s face.\r\n\r\n“Near S. did you say? Then we may see each other again perhaps. They\r\nmight send us there!” Mashurina sighed. “Oh, Alexai Dmitritch—”\r\n\r\n“What is it?” Nejdanov asked.\r\n\r\nMashurina looked intense.\r\n\r\n“Oh, nothing. Goodbye. It’s nothing.” She squeezed Nejdanov’s hand a\r\nsecond time and went out.\r\n\r\n“There is not a soul in St. Petersburg who is so attached to me as\r\nthis eccentric person,” he thought. “I wish she had not interrupted me\r\nthough. However, I suppose it’s for the best.”\r\n\r\nThe next morning Nejdanov called at Sipiagin’s townhouse and was shown\r\ninto a magnificent study, furnished in a rather severe style, but\r\nquite in keeping with the dignity of a statesman of liberal views. The\r\ngentleman himself was sitting before an enormous bureau, piled up\r\nwith all sorts of useless papers, arrayed in the strictest order, and\r\nnumerous ivory paper-knives, which had never been known to cut anything.\r\nDuring the space of an hour Nejdanov listened to the wise, courteous,\r\npatronising speeches of his host, received a hundred roubles, and ten\r\ndays later was leaning back in the plush seat of a reserved first-class\r\ncompartment, side by side with this same wise, liberal politician, being\r\nborne along to Moscow on the jolting lines of the Nikolaevsky Railway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nIn the drawing room of a large stone house with a Greek front—built in\r\nthe twenties of the present century by Sipiagin’s father, a\r\nwell-known landowner, who was distinguished by the free use of his\r\nfists—Sipiagin’s wife, Valentina Mihailovna, a very beautiful woman,\r\nhaving been informed by telegram of her husband’s arrival, sat expecting\r\nhim every moment. The room was decorated in the best modern taste.\r\nEverything in it was charming and inviting, from the walls hung in\r\nvariegated cretonne and beautiful curtains, to the various porcelain,\r\nbronze, and crystal knickknacks arranged upon the tables and cabinets;\r\nthe whole blending together into a subdued harmony and brightened by\r\nthe rays of the May sun, which was streaming in through the wide-open\r\nwindows. The still air, laden with the scent of lily-of-the-valley\r\n(large bunches of these beautiful spring flowers were placed about the\r\nroom), was stirred from time to time by a slight breeze from without,\r\nblowing gently over the richly grown garden.\r\n\r\nWhat a charming picture! And the mistress herself, Valentina Mihailovna\r\nSipiagina, put the finishing touch to it, gave it meaning and life. She\r\nwas a tall woman of about thirty, with dark brown hair, a fresh dark\r\ncomplexion, resembling the Sistine Madonna, with wonderfully deep,\r\nvelvety eyes. Her pale lips were somewhat too full, her shoulders\r\nperhaps too square, her hands rather too large, but, for all that,\r\nanyone seeing her as she flitted gracefully about the drawing room,\r\nbending from her slender waist to sniff at the flowers with a smile on\r\nher lips, or arranging some Chinese vase, or quickly readjusting her\r\nglossy hair before the looking-glass, half-closing her wonderful eyes,\r\nanyone would have declared that there could not be a more fascinating\r\ncreature.\r\n\r\nA pretty curly-haired boy of about nine burst into the room and stopped\r\nsuddenly on catching sight of her. He was dressed in a Highland costume,\r\nhis legs bare, and was very much befrizzled and pomaded.\r\n\r\n“What do you want, Kolia?” Valentina Mihailovna asked. Her voice was as\r\nsoft and velvety as her eyes.\r\n\r\n“Mamma,” the boy began in confusion, “auntie sent me to get some\r\nlilies-of-the-valley for her room.... She hasn’t got any—”\r\n\r\nValentina Mihailovna put her hand under her little boy’s chin and raised\r\nhis pomaded head.\r\n\r\n“Tell auntie that she can send to the gardener for flowers. These are\r\nmine. I don’t want them to be touched. Tell her that I don’t like to\r\nupset my arrangements. Can you repeat what I said?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I can,” the boy whispered.\r\n\r\n“Well, repeat it then.”\r\n\r\n“I will say... I will say... that you don’t want.”\r\n\r\nValentina Mihailovna laughed, and her laugh, too, was soft.\r\n\r\n“I see that one can’t give you messages as yet. But never mind, tell her\r\nanything you like.”\r\n\r\nThe boy hastily kissed his mother’s hand, adorned with rings, and rushed\r\nout of the room.\r\n\r\nValentina Mihailovna looked after him, sighed, walked up to a golden\r\nwire cage, on one side of which a green parrot was carefully holding\r\non with its beak and claws. She teased it a little with the tip of her\r\nfinger, then dropped on to a narrow couch, and picking up a number of\r\nthe “Revue des Deux Mondes” from a round carved table, began turning\r\nover its pages.\r\n\r\nA respectful cough made her look round. A handsome servant in livery and\r\na white cravat was standing by the door.\r\n\r\n“What do you want, Agafon?” she asked in the same soft voice.\r\n\r\n“Simion Petrovitch Kollomietzev is here. Shall I show him in?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly. And tell Mariana Vikentievna to come to the drawing room.”\r\n\r\nValentina Mihailovna threw the “Revue des Deux Mondes” on the table,\r\nraised her eyes upwards as if thinking—a pose which suited her\r\nextremely.\r\n\r\nFrom the languid, though free and easy, way in which Simion Petrovitch\r\nKollomietzev, a young man of thirty-two, entered the room; from the way\r\nin which he brightened suddenly, bowed slightly to one side, and drew\r\nhimself up again gracefully; from the manner in which he spoke, not\r\ntoo harshly, nor too gently; from the respectful way in which he kissed\r\nValentina Mihailovna’s hand, one could see that the new-comer was not\r\na mere provincial, an ordinary rich country neighbour, but a St.\r\nPetersburg grandee of the highest society. He was dressed in the latest\r\nEnglish fashion. A corner of the coloured border of his white cambric\r\npocket handkerchief peeped out of the breast pocket of his tweed coat,\r\na monocle dangled on a wide black ribbon, the pale tint of his suede\r\ngloves matched his grey checked trousers. He was clean shaven, and his\r\nhair was closely cropped. His features were somewhat effeminate, with\r\nhis large eyes, set close together, his small flat nose, full red lips,\r\nbetokening the amiable disposition of a well-bred nobleman. He was\r\neffusion itself, but very easily turned spiteful, and even vulgar, when\r\nany one dared to annoy him, or to upset his religious, conservative,\r\nor patriotic principles. Then he became merciless. All his elegance\r\nvanished like smoke, his soft eyes assumed a cruel expression, ugly\r\nwords would flow from his beautiful mouth, and he usually got the best\r\nof an argument by appealing to the authorities.\r\n\r\nHis family had once been simple gardeners. His great-grandfather\r\nwas called Kolomientzov after the place in which he was born; his\r\ngrandfather used to sign himself Kolomietzev; his father added another\r\n_l_ and wrote himself Kollomietzev, and finally Simion Petrovitch\r\nconsidered himself to be an aristocrat of the bluest blood, with\r\npretensions to having descended from the well-known Barons von\r\nGallenmeier, one of whom had been a field-marshal in the Thirty Years’\r\nWar. Simion Petrovitch was a chamberlain, and served in the ministerial\r\ncourt. His patriotism had prevented him from entering the diplomatic\r\nservice, for which he was cut out by his personal appearance,\r\neducation, knowledge of the world, and his success with women. _Mais\r\nquitter la Russie? Jamais!_ Kollomietzev was rich and had a great many\r\ninfluential friends. He passed for a promising, reliable young man _un\r\npeu fèodal dans ses opinions_, as Prince B. said of him, and Prince\r\nB. was one of the leading lights in St. Petersburg official circles.\r\nKollomietzev had come away on a two months’ leave to look after his\r\nestate, that is, to threaten and oppress his peasants a little more.\r\n“You can’t get on without that!” he used to say.\r\n\r\n“I thought that your husband would have been here by now,” he began,\r\nrocking himself from one leg to the other. He suddenly drew himself up\r\nand looked down sideways—a very dignified pose.\r\n\r\nValentina Mihailovna made a grimace.\r\n\r\n“Would you not have come otherwise?”\r\n\r\nKollomietzev drew back a pace, horrified at the imputation.\r\n\r\n“Valentina Mihailovna!” he exclaimed. “How can you possibly say such a\r\nthing?”\r\n\r\n“Well, never mind. Sit down. My husband will be here soon. I have sent\r\nthe carriage to the station to meet him. If you wait a little, you will\r\nbe rewarded by seeing him. What time is it?”\r\n\r\n“Half-past two,” Kollomietzev replied, taking a large gold enamelled\r\nwatch out of his waistcoat pocket and showing it to Valentina\r\nMihailovna. “Have you seen this watch? A present from Michael, the\r\nServian Prince Obrenovitch. Look, here are his initials. We are great\r\nfriends—go out hunting a lot together. Such a splendid fellow, with an\r\niron hand, just what an administrator ought to be. He will never allow\r\nhimself to be made a fool of. Not he! Oh dear no!”\r\n\r\nKollomietzev dropped into an armchair, crossed his legs, and began\r\nleisurely pulling off his left glove.\r\n\r\n“We are badly in need of such a man as Michael in our province here,” he\r\nremarked.\r\n\r\n“Why? Are you dissatisfied with things here?”\r\n\r\nKollomietzev made a wry face.\r\n\r\n“It’s this abominable county council! What earthly use is it? Only\r\nweakens the government and sets people thinking the wrong way.” (He\r\ngesticulated with his left hand, freed from the pressure of the glove.)\r\n“And arouses false hopes.” (Kollomietzev blew on his hand.) “I have\r\nalready mentioned this in St. Petersburg, _mais bah!_ they won’t listen to\r\nme. Even your husband—but then he is known to be a confirmed liberal!”\r\n\r\nValentina Mihailovna sat up straight.\r\n\r\n“What do I hear? You opposed to the government, Monsieur Kollomietzev?”\r\n\r\n“I—not in the least! Never! What an idea! _Mais j’ai mon franc parler._\r\nI occasionally allow myself to criticise, but am always obedient.”\r\n\r\n“And I, on the contrary, never criticise and am never obedient.”\r\n\r\n“_Ah! Mais c’est un mot!_ Do let me repeat it to my friend _Ladislas_.\r\n_Vous savez_, he is writing a society novel, read me some of it.\r\nCharming! _Nous aurons enfin le grand monde russe peint par lui-même.”_\r\n\r\n“Where is it to be published?”\r\n\r\n“In the ‘Russian Messenger’, of course. It is our ‘Revue des Deux\r\nMondes’. I see you take it, by the way.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but I think it rather dull of late.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps, perhaps it is. ‘The Russian Messenger’, too, has also gone off\r\na bit,” using a colloquial expression.\r\n\r\nKollomietzev laughed. It amused him to have said “gone off a bit.” _“Mais\r\nc’est un journal qui se respecte,”_ he continued, “and that is the main\r\nthing. I am sorry to say that I interest myself very little in Russian\r\nliterature nowadays. It has grown so horribly vulgar. A cook is now\r\nmade the heroine of a novel. A mere cook, _parole d’honneur_! Of course,\r\nI shall read Ladislas’ novel. _Il y aura le petit mot pour rire_, and he\r\nwrites with a purpose! He will completely crush the nihilists, and I\r\nquite agree with him. His ideas _sont très correctes_.”\r\n\r\n“That is more than can be said of his past,” Valentina Mihailovna\r\nremarked.\r\n\r\n_“Ah! jeton une voile sur les erreurs de sa jeunesse!”_ Kollomietzev\r\nexclaimed, pulling off his other glove.\r\n\r\nValentina Mihailovna half-closed her exquisite eyes and looked at him\r\ncoquettishly.\r\n\r\n“Simion Petrovitch!” she exclaimed, “why do you use so many French words\r\nwhen speaking Russian? It seems to me rather old-fashioned, if you will\r\nexcuse my saying so.”\r\n\r\n“But, my dear lady, not everyone is such a master of our native tongue\r\nas you are, for instance. I have a very great respect for the\r\nRussian language. There is nothing like it for giving commands or for\r\ngovernmental purposes. I like to keep it pure and uncorrupted by other\r\nlanguages and bow before Karamzin; but as for an everyday language, how\r\ncan one use Russian? For instance, how would you say, in Russian, _de\r\ntout à l’heure, c’est un mot_? You could not possibly say ‘this is a\r\nword,’ could you?”\r\n\r\n“You might say ‘a happy expression.’”\r\n\r\nKollomietzev laughed.\r\n\r\n“A happy expression! My dear Valentina Mihailovna. Don’t you feel that\r\nit savours of the schoolroom; that all the salt has gone out of it?”\r\n\r\n“I am afraid you will not convince me. I wonder where Mariana is?” She\r\nrang the bell and a servant entered.\r\n\r\n“I asked to have Mariana Vikentievna sent here. Has she not been told?”\r\n\r\nThe servant had scarcely time to reply when a young girl appeared behind\r\nhim in the doorway. She had on a loose dark blouse, and her hair was\r\ncut short. It was Mariana Vikentievna Sinitska, Sipiagin’s niece on the\r\nmother’s side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n“I am sorry, Valentina Mihailovna,” Mariana said, drawing near to her,\r\n“I was busy and could not get away.”\r\n\r\nShe bowed to Kollomietzev and withdrew into a corner, where she sat down\r\non a little stool near the parrot, who began flapping its wings as soon\r\nas it caught sight of her.\r\n\r\n“Why so far away, Mariana?” Valentina Mihailovna asked, looking after\r\nher. “Do you want to be near your little friend? Just think, Simion\r\nPetrovitch,” she said, turning to Kollomietzev, “our parrot has simply\r\nfallen in love with Mariana!”\r\n\r\n“I don’t wonder at it!”\r\n\r\n“But he simply can’t bear me!”\r\n\r\n“How extraordinary! Perhaps you tease him.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, I never tease him. On the contrary, I feed him with sugar.\r\nBut he won’t take anything out of my hand. It is a case of sympathy and\r\nantipathy.”\r\n\r\nMariana looked sternly at Valentina Mihailovna and Valentina Mihailovna\r\nlooked at her. These two women did not love one another.\r\n\r\nCompared to her aunt Mariana seemed plain. She had a round face, a large\r\naquiline nose, big bright grey eyes, fine eyebrows, and thin lips.\r\nHer thick brown hair was cut short; she seemed retiring, but there was\r\nsomething strong and daring, impetuous and passionate, in the whole of\r\nher personality. She had tiny little hands and feet, and her healthy,\r\nlithesome little figure reminded one of a Florentine statuette of the\r\nsixteenth century. Her movements were free and graceful.\r\n\r\nMariana’s position in the Sipiagin’s house was a very difficult one. Her\r\nfather, a brilliant man of Polish extraction, who had attained the rank\r\nof general, was discovered to have embezzled large state funds. He\r\nwas tried and convicted, deprived of his rank, nobility, and exiled\r\nto Siberia. After some time he was pardoned and returned, but was too\r\nutterly crushed to begin life anew, and died in extreme poverty. His\r\nwife, Sipiagin’s sister, did not survive the shock of the disgrace and\r\nher husband’s death, and died soon after. Uncle Sipiagin gave a home to\r\ntheir only child, Mariana. She loathed her life of dependence and longed\r\nfor freedom with all the force of her upright soul. There was a constant\r\ninner battle between her and her aunt. Valentina Mihailovna looked upon\r\nher as a nihilist and freethinker, and Mariana detested her aunt as\r\nan unconscious tyrant. She held aloof from her uncle and, indeed, from\r\neveryone else in the house. She held aloof, but was not afraid of them.\r\nShe was not timid by nature.\r\n\r\n“Antipathy is a strange thing,” Kollomietzev repeated. “Everybody knows\r\nthat I am a deeply religious man, orthodox in the fullest sense of the\r\nword, but the sight of a priest’s flowing locks drives me nearly mad. It\r\nmakes me boil over with rage.”\r\n\r\n“I believe hair in general has an irritating effect upon you, Simion\r\nPetrovitch,” Mariana remarked. “I feel sure you can’t bear to see it cut\r\nshort like mine.”\r\n\r\nValentina Mihailovna lifted her eyebrows slowly, then dropped her head,\r\nas if astonished at the freedom with which modern young girls entered\r\ninto conversation. Kollomietzev smiled condescendingly.\r\n\r\n“Of course,” he said, “I can’t help feeling sorry for beautiful curls\r\nsuch as yours, Mariana Vikentievna, falling under the merciless snip of\r\na pair of scissors, but it doesn’t arouse antipathy in me. In any case,\r\nyour example might even ... even ... convert me!”\r\n\r\nKollomietzev could not think of a Russian word, and did not like using a\r\nFrench one, after what his hostess had said.\r\n\r\n“Thank heaven,” Valentina Mihailovna remarked, “Mariana does not wear\r\nglasses and has not yet discarded collars and cuffs; but, unfortunately,\r\nshe studies natural history, and is even interested in the woman\r\nquestion. Isn’t that so, Mariana?”\r\n\r\nThis was evidently said to make Mariana feel uncomfortable, but Mariana,\r\nhowever, did not feel uncomfortable.\r\n\r\n“Yes, auntie,” she replied, “I read everything I can get hold of on the\r\nsubject. I am trying to understand the woman question.”\r\n\r\n“There is youth for you!” Valentina Mihailovna exclaimed, turning to\r\nKollomietzev. “Now you and I are not at all interested in that sort of\r\nthing, are we?”\r\n\r\nKollomietzev smiled good-naturedly; he could not help entering into the\r\nplayful mood of his amiable hostess.\r\n\r\n“Mariana Vikentievna,” he began, “is still full of the ideals.. . the\r\nromanticism of youth ... which ... in time—”\r\n\r\n“Heaven, I was unjust to myself,” Valentina Mihailovna interrupted him;\r\n“I am also interested in these questions. I am not quite an old lady\r\nyet.”\r\n\r\n“Of course. So am I in a way,” Kollomietzev put in hastily. “Only I\r\nwould forbid such things being talked about!”\r\n\r\n“Forbid them being talked about?” Mariana asked in astonishment.\r\n\r\n“Yes! I would say to the public, ‘Interest yourselves in these things as\r\nmuch as you like, but talk about them ... sh.’” He layed his finger\r\non his lips.\r\n\r\n“I would, at any rate, forbid speaking through _the press_ under any\r\nconditions!”\r\n\r\nValentina Mihailovna laughed.\r\n\r\n“What? Would you have a commission appointed by the ministers for\r\nsettling these questions?”\r\n\r\n“Why not? Don’t you think we could do it better than these ignorant,\r\nhungry loafers who know nothing and imagine themselves to be men of\r\ngenius? We could appoint Boris Andraevitch as president.”\r\n\r\nValentina Mihailovna laughed louder still.\r\n\r\n“You had better take care, Boris Andraevitch is sometimes such a\r\nJacobin—”\r\n\r\n“Jacko, jacko, jacko,” the parrot screamed. Valentina Mihailovna waved\r\nher handkerchief at him. “Don’t interrupt an intelligent conversation!\r\nMariana, do teach him manners!”\r\n\r\nMariana turned to the cage and began stroking the parrot’s neck with her\r\nfinger; the parrot stretched towards her.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” Valentina Mihailovna continued, “Boris Andraevitch astonishes me,\r\ntoo, sometimes. There is a certain strain in him... a certain strain...\r\nof the tribune.”\r\n\r\n_“C’est parce qu’il est orateur!”_ Kollomietzev exclaimed\r\nenthusiastically in French. “Your husband is a marvellous orator and is\r\naccustomed to success ... _ses propres paroles le grisent_ ... and then\r\nhis desire for popularity.... By the way, he is rather annoyed just now,\r\nis he not? _Il boude?_ Eh?”\r\n\r\nValentina Mihailovna looked at Mariana.\r\n\r\n“I haven’t noticed it,” she said after a pause. “Yes,” Kollomietzev\r\ncontinued pensively, “he was rather overlooked at Easter.”\r\n\r\nValentina Mihailovna indicated Mariana with her eyes. Kollomietzev\r\nsmiled and screwed up his eyes, conveying to her that he understood.\r\n“Mariana Vikentievna,” he exclaimed suddenly, in an unnecessarily loud\r\ntone of voice, “do you intend teaching at the school again this year?”\r\n\r\nMariana turned round from the cage.\r\n\r\n“Are you interested to know, Simion Petrovitch?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly. I am very much interested.”\r\n\r\n“Would you forbid it?”\r\n\r\n“I would forbid nihilists even so much as to think of schools. I would\r\nput all schools into the hands of the clergy, and with an eye on them I\r\nwouldn’t mind running one myself!”\r\n\r\n“Really! I haven’t the slightest idea what I shall do this year. Last\r\nyear things were not at all successful. Besides, how can you get a\r\nschool together in the summer?”\r\n\r\nMariana blushed deeply all the time she was speaking, as if it cost her\r\nsome effort. She was still very self-conscious.\r\n\r\n“Are you not sufficiently prepared?” Valentina Mihailovna asked\r\nsarcastically.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps not.”\r\n\r\n“Heavens!” Kollomietzev exclaimed. “What do I hear? Oh ye gods! Is\r\npreparation necessary to teach peasants the alphabet?”\r\n\r\nAt this moment Kolia ran into the drawing room shouting “Mamma! mamma!\r\nPapa has come!” And after him, waddling on her stout little legs,\r\nappeared an old grey-haired lady in a cap and yellow shawl, and also\r\nannounced that Boris had come.\r\n\r\nThis lady was Sipiagin’s aunt, and was called Anna Zaharovna. Everyone\r\nin the drawing room rushed out into the hall, down the stairs, and on\r\nto the steps of the portico. A long avenue of chipped yews ran straight\r\nfrom these steps to the high road—a carriage and four was already\r\nrolling up the avenue straight towards them. Valentina Mihailovna,\r\nstanding in front, waved her pocket handkerchief, Kolia shrieked with\r\ndelight, the coachman adroitly pulled up the steaming horses, a footman\r\ncame down headlong from the box and almost pulled the carriage door\r\noff its hinges in his effort to open it—and then, with a condescending\r\nsmile on his lips, in his eyes, over the whole of his face, Boris\r\nAndraevitch, with one graceful gesture of the shoulders, dropped his\r\ncloak and sprang to the ground. Valentina Mihailovna gracefully threw\r\nher arms round his neck and they kissed three times. Kolia stamped\r\nhis little feet and pulled at his father’s coat from behind, but\r\nBoris Andraevitch first kissed Anna Zaharovna, quickly threw off his\r\nuncomfortable, ugly Scotch cap, greeted Mariana and Kollomietzev, who\r\nhad also come out (he gave Kollomietzev a hearty shake of the hand in\r\nthe English fashion), and then turned to his little son, lifted him\r\nunder the arms, and kissed him.\r\n\r\nDuring this scene Nejdanov half guiltily scrambled out of the carriage\r\nand, without removing his cap, stood quietly near the front wheel,\r\nlooking out from under his eyebrows. Valentina Mihailovna, when\r\nembracing her husband, had cast a penetrating look over his shoulder at\r\nthis new figure. Sipiagin had informed her that he was bringing a tutor.\r\n\r\nEveryone continued exchanging greetings and shaking hands with the\r\nnewly-arrived host as they all moved up the broad stairs, lined on\r\neither side with the principal men and maid servants. They did not come\r\nforward to kiss the master’s hand (an Asiatic custom they had abandoned\r\nlong ago), but bowed respectfully. Sipiagin responded to their\r\nsalutations with a slight movement of the nose and eyebrows, rather than\r\nan inclination of the head.\r\n\r\nNejdanov followed the stream up the wide stairs. As soon as they reached\r\nthe hall, Sipiagin, who had been searching for Nejdanov with his eyes,\r\nintroduced him to his wife, Anna Zaharovna, and Mariana, and said to\r\nKolia, “This is your tutor. Mind you do as he tells you. Give him your\r\nhand.” Kolia extended his hand timidly, stared at him fixedly, but\r\nfinding nothing particularly interesting about his tutor, turned to his\r\n“papa” again. Nejdanov felt uncomfortable, just as he had done at the\r\ntheatre. He wore an old shabby coat, and his face and hands were covered\r\nwith dust from the journey. Valentina Mihailovna said something kindly\r\nto him, but he did not quite catch what it was and did not reply.\r\nHe noticed that she was very bright, and clung to her husband\r\naffectionately. He did not like Kolia’s befrizzled and pomaded head, and\r\nwhen his eye fell on Kollomietzev, thought, “What a sleek individual.” He\r\npaid no attention to the others. Sipiagin turned his head once or twice\r\nin a dignified manner, as if looking round at his worldly belongings, a\r\npose that set off to perfection his long drooping whiskers and somewhat\r\nsmall round neck. Then he shouted to one of the servants in a loud\r\nresonant voice, not at all husky from the journey, “Ivan! Take this\r\ngentleman to the green room and see to his luggage afterwards!” He then\r\ntold Nejdanov that he could change and rest awhile, and that dinner\r\nwould be served at five o’clock. Nejdanov bowed and followed Ivan to the\r\n“green” room, which was situated on the second floor.\r\n\r\nThe whole company went into the drawing room. The host was welcomed all\r\nover again. An old blind nurse appeared and made him a courtesy. Out of\r\nconsideration for her years, Sipiagin gave her his hand to kiss. He\r\nthen begged Kollomietzev to excuse him, and retired to his own room\r\naccompanied by his wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nThe room into which the servant conducted Nejdanov was beautifully neat\r\nand spacious, with wide-open windows looking on to the garden. A gentle\r\nbreeze stirred the white curtains, blowing them out high like sails\r\nand letting them fall again. Golden reflections glided lightly over the\r\nceiling; the whole room was filled with the moist freshness of spring.\r\nNejdanov dismissed the servant, unpacked his trunk, washed, and changed.\r\nThe journey had thoroughly exhausted him. The constant presence of a\r\nstranger during the last two days, the many fruitless discussions, had\r\ncompletely upset his nerves. A certain bitterness, which was neither\r\nboredom nor anger, accumulated mysteriously in the depths of his being.\r\nHe was annoyed with himself for his lack of courage, but his heart\r\nached. He went up to the window and looked out into the garden. It was\r\nan old-fashioned garden, with rich dark soil, such as one rarely sees\r\naround Moscow, laid out on the slope of a hill into four separate parts.\r\nIn front of the house there was a flower garden, with straight gravel\r\npaths, groups of acacias and lilac, and round flower beds. To the left,\r\npast the stable yard, as far down as the barn, there was an orchard,\r\nthickly planted with apples, pears, plums, currants, and raspberries.\r\nBeyond the flower garden, in front of the house, there was a large\r\nsquare walk, thickly interlaced with lime trees. To the right, the view\r\nwas shut out by an avenue of silver poplars; a glimpse of an orangery\r\ncould be seen through a group of weeping willows. The whole garden was\r\nclothed in its first green leaves; the loud buzz of summer insects\r\nwas not yet heard; the leaves rustled gently, chaffinches twittered\r\neverywhere; two doves sat cooing on a tree; the note of a solitary\r\ncuckoo was heard first in one place, then in another; the friendly\r\ncawing of rooks was carried from the distance beyond the mill pond,\r\nsounding like the creaking of innumerable cart wheels. Light clouds\r\nfloated dreamily over this gentle stillness, spreading themselves out\r\nlike the breasts of some huge, lazy birds.\r\n\r\nNejdanov gazed and listened, drinking in the cool air through\r\nhalf-parted lips.\r\n\r\nHis depression left him and a wonderful calmness entered his soul.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile he was being discussed in the bedroom below. Sipiagin was\r\ntelling his wife how he had met him, what Prince G. had said of him, and\r\nthe gist of their talks on the journey.\r\n\r\n“A clever chap!” he repeated, “and well educated, too. It’s true he’s a\r\nrevolutionist, but what does it matter? These people are ambitious, at\r\nany rate. As for Kolia, he is too young to be spoiled by any of this\r\nnonsense.”\r\n\r\nValentina Mihailovna listened to her husband affectionately; an amused\r\nsmile played on her lips, as if he were telling her of some naughty\r\namusing prank. It was pleasant to her to think that her _seigneur et\r\nmaître_, such a respectable man, of important position, could be as\r\nmischievous as a boy of twenty. Standing before the looking-glass in a\r\nsnow-white shirt and blue silk braces, Sipiagin was brushing his hair\r\nin the English fashion with two brushes, while Valentina Mihailovna,\r\nher feet tucked under her, was sitting on a narrow Turkish couch,\r\ntelling him various news about the house, the paper mill, which, alas,\r\nwas not going well, as was to be expected; about the possibilities of\r\nchanging the cook, about the church, of which the plaster had come off;\r\nabout Mariana, Kollomietzev....\r\n\r\nBetween husband and wife there existed the fullest confidence and good\r\nunderstanding; they certainly lived in “love and harmony,” as people\r\nused to say in olden days. When Sipiagin, after finishing his toilet,\r\nasked chivalrously for his wife’s hand and she gave him both, and\r\nwatched him with an affectionate pride as he kissed them in turn, the\r\nfeeling expressed in their faces was good and true, although in her it\r\nshone out of a pair of eyes worthy of Raphael, and in him out of the\r\nordinary eyes of a mere official.\r\n\r\nOn the stroke of five Nejdanov went down to dinner, which was announced\r\nby a Chinese gong, not by a bell. The whole company was already\r\nassembled in the dining room. Sipiagin welcomed him again from behind\r\nhis high cravat, and showed him to a place between Anna Zaharovna and\r\nKolia. Anna Zaharovna was an old maid, a sister of Sipiagin’s father;\r\nshe exhaled a smell of camphor, like a garment that had been put away\r\nfor a long time, and had a nervous, dejected look. She had acted as\r\nKolia’s nurse or governess, and her wrinkled face expressed displeasure\r\nwhen Nejdanov sat down between her and her charge. Kolia looked sideways\r\nat his new neighbour; the intelligent boy soon saw that his tutor was\r\nshy and uncomfortable, that he did not raise his eyes, and scarcely ate\r\nanything. This pleased Kolia, who had been afraid that his tutor would\r\nbe cross and severe. Valentina Mihailovna also watched Nejdanov.\r\n\r\n“He looks like a student,” she thought to herself. “He’s not accustomed\r\nto society, but has a very interesting face, and the colour of his hair\r\nis like that of the apostle whose hair the old Italian masters always\r\npainted red—and his hands are clean!” Indeed, everybody at the table\r\nstared at Nejdanov, but they had mercy on him, and left him in peace\r\nfor the time being. He was conscious of this, and was pleased and angry\r\nabout it at the same time.\r\n\r\nSipiagin and Kollomietzev carried on the conversation. They talked about\r\nthe county council, the governor, the highway tax, the peasants buying\r\nout the land, about mutual Moscow and St. Petersburg acquaintances,\r\nKatkov’s lyceum, which was just coming into fashion, about the\r\ndifficulty of getting labour, penalties, and damage caused by cattle,\r\neven of Bismarck, the war of 1866, and Napoleon III., whom Kollomietzev\r\ncalled a hero. Kollomietzev gave vent to the most retrograde opinions,\r\ngoing so far as to propose, in jest it is true, a toast given by a\r\ncertain friend of his on a names-day banquet, “I drink to the only\r\nprinciple I acknowledge, the whip and Roedeger!”\r\n\r\nValentina Mihailovna frowned, and remarked that it was _de très mauvais\r\ngoût_.\r\n\r\nSipiagin, on the contrary, expressed the most liberal views, refuted\r\nKollomietzev’s arguments politely, though with a certain amount of\r\ndisdain, and even chaffed him a little.\r\n\r\n“Your terror of emancipation, my dear Simion Petrovitch,” he said, “puts\r\nme in mind of our much respected friend, Alexai Ivanovitch Tveritinov,\r\nand the petition he sent in, in the year 1860. He insisted on reading\r\nit in every drawing room in St. Petersburg. There was one rather good\r\nsentence in it about our liberated serf, who was to march over the face\r\nof the fatherland bearing a torch in his hand. You should have seen our\r\ndear Alexai Ivanovitch, blowing out his cheeks and blinking his little\r\neyes, pronounce in his babyish voice, ‘T-torch! t-torch! Will march with\r\na t-torch!’ Well, the emancipation is now an established fact, but where\r\nis the peasant with the torch?”\r\n\r\n“Tveritinov was only slightly wrong,” Kollomietzev said solemnly. “Not\r\nthe peasants will march with the torch, but others.”\r\n\r\nAt the words, Nejdanov, who until then had scarcely noticed Mariana,\r\nwho sat a little to one side, exchanged glances with her, and instantly\r\nfelt that this solemn girl and he were of the same convictions, of the\r\nsame stamp. She had made no impression on him whatever when Sipiagin\r\nhad introduced them; then why did he exchange glances with her in\r\nparticular? He wondered if it was not disgraceful to sit and listen\r\nto such views without protesting and by reason of his silence letting\r\nothers think that he shared them. Nejdanov looked at Mariana a second\r\ntime, and her eyes seemed to say, “Wait a while... the time is not\r\nripe.... It isn’t worth it... later on... there is plenty of time in\r\nstore.”\r\n\r\nHe was happy to think that she understood him, and began following the\r\nconversation again. Valentina Mihailovna supported her husband, and was,\r\nif anything, even more radical in her expressions than he. She could not\r\nunderstand, “simply could not un-der-stand, how an educated young man\r\ncould hold such antiquated views.”\r\n\r\n“However,” she added, “I am convinced that you only say these things for\r\nthe sake of argument. And you, Alexai Dmitritch,” she added to Nejdanov,\r\nwith a smile (he wondered how she had learned his Christian name and\r\nhis father’s name), “I know, do not share Simion Petrovitch’s fears; my\r\nhusband told me about your talks on the journey.”\r\n\r\nNejdanov blushed, bent over his plate, and mumbled something; he did not\r\nfeel shy, but was simply unaccustomed to conversing with such brilliant\r\npersonages. Madame Sipiagin continued smiling to him; her husband nodded\r\nhis head patronisingly. Kollomietzev stuck his monocle between his\r\neyebrow and nose and stared at the student who dared not to share his\r\n“fears.” But it was difficult to embarrass Nejdanov in this way; on the\r\ncontrary, he instantly sat up straight, and in his turn fixed his\r\ngaze on the fashionable official. Just as instinctively as he had\r\nfelt Mariana to be a comrade, so he felt Kollomietzev to be an enemy!\r\nKollomietzev felt it too; he removed his monocle, turned away, and\r\ntried to laugh carelessly—but it did not come off somehow. Only Anna\r\nZaharovna, who secretly worshipped him, was on his side, and became even\r\nangrier than before with the unwelcome neighbour separating her from\r\nKolia.\r\n\r\nSoon after this dinner came to an end. The company went out on the\r\nterrace to drink coffee. Sipiagin and Kollomietzev lit up cigars.\r\nSipiagin offered Nejdanov a regalia, but the latter refused.\r\n\r\n“Why, of course!” Sipiagin exclaimed; “I’ve forgotten that you only\r\nsmoke your own particular cigarettes!”\r\n\r\n“A curious taste!” Kollomietzev muttered between his teeth.\r\n\r\nNejdanov very nearly burst out, “I know the difference between a regalia\r\nand a cigarette quite well, but I don’t want to be under an obligation\r\nto anyone!” but he contained himself and held his peace. He put down\r\nthis second piece of insolence to his enemy’s account.\r\n\r\n“Mariana!” Madame Sipiagin suddenly called, “don’t be on ceremony with\r\nour new friend... smoke your cigarette if you like. All the more so,\r\nas I hear,” she added, turning to Nejdanov, “that among you all young\r\nladies smoke.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” Nejdanov remarked dryly. This was the first remark he had made to\r\nMadame Sipiagina.\r\n\r\n“I don’t smoke,” she continued, screwing up her velvety eyes\r\ncaressingly. “I suppose I am behind the times.”\r\n\r\nMariana slowly and carefully took out a cigarette, a box of matches,\r\nand began to smoke, as if on purpose to spite her aunt. Nejdanov took a\r\nlight from Mariana and also began smoking.\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful evening. Kolia and Anna Zaharovna went into the\r\ngarden; the others remained for some time longer on the terrace enjoying\r\nthe fresh air. The conversation was very lively. Kollomietzev condemned\r\nmodern literature, and on this subject, too, Sipiagin showed himself\r\na liberal. He insisted on the utter freedom and independence of\r\nliterature, pointed out its uses, instanced Chateaubriand, whom the\r\nEmperor Alexander Pavlitch had invested with the order of St. Andrew!\r\nNejdanov did not take part in the discussion; Madame Sipiagina watched\r\nhim with an expression of approval and surprise at his modesty.\r\n\r\nThey all went in to drink tea in the drawing room.\r\n\r\n“Alexai Dmitritch,” Sipiagin said to Nejdanov, “we are addicted to the\r\nbad habit of playing cards in the evening, and even play a forbidden\r\ngame, stukushka.... I won’t ask you to join us, but perhaps Mariana will\r\nbe good enough to play you something on the piano. You like music, I\r\nhope.” And without waiting for an answer Sipiagin took up a pack of\r\ncards. Mariana sat down at the piano and played, rather indifferently,\r\nseveral of Mendelssohn’s “Songs Without Words”. _Charmant! Charmant! quel\r\ntouché!_ Kollomietzev called out from the other end of the room, but\r\nthe exclamation was only due to politeness, and Nejdanov, in spite of\r\nSipiagin’s remark, showed no passion for music.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Sipiagin, his wife, Kollomietzev, and Anna Zaharovna sat\r\ndown to cards. Kolia came to say goodnight, and, receiving his parents’\r\nblessing and a large glass of milk instead of tea, went off to bed. His\r\nfather called after him to inform him that tomorrow he was to begin his\r\nlessons with Alexai Dmitritch. A little later, seeing Nejdanov wandering\r\naimlessly about the room and turning over the photographic albums,\r\napparently without any interest, Sipiagin begged him not to be on\r\nceremony and retire if he wished, as he was probably tired after the\r\njourney, and to remember that the ruling principle of their house was\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nNejdanov took advantage of this and bowing to all present went out. In\r\nthe doorway he knocked against Mariana, and, looking into her eyes, was\r\nconvinced a second time that they would be comrades, although she\r\nshowed no sign of pleasure at seeing him, but, on the contrary, frowned\r\nheavily.\r\n\r\nWhen he went in, his room was filled with a sweet freshness; the windows\r\nhad stood wide open all day. In the garden, opposite his window, a\r\nnightingale was trilling out its sweet song; the evening sky became\r\ncovered with the warm glow of the rising moon behind the rounded tops of\r\nthe lime trees. Nejdanov lit a candle; a grey moth fluttered in from the\r\ndark garden straight to the flame; she circled round it, whilst a gentle\r\nbreeze from without blew on them both, disturbing the yellow-bluish\r\nflame of the candle.\r\n\r\n“How strange!” Nejdanov thought, lying in bed; “they seem good,\r\nliberal-minded people, even humane... but I feel so troubled in my\r\nheart. This chamberlain... Kollomietzev.... However, morning is wiser\r\nthan evening.... It’s no good being sentimental.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment the watchman knocked loudly with his stick and called\r\nout, “I say there—”\r\n\r\n“Take care,” answered another doleful voice. “Fugh! Heavens! It’s like\r\nbeing in prison!” Nejdanov exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nNejdanov awoke early and, without waiting for a servant, dressed and\r\nwent out into the garden. It was very large and beautiful this garden,\r\nand well kept. Hired labourers were scraping the paths with their\r\nspades, through the bright green shrubs a glimpse of kerchiefs could\r\nbe seen on the heads of the peasant girls armed with rakes. Nejdanov\r\nwandered down to the pond; the early morning mist had already lifted,\r\nonly a few curves in its banks still remained in obscurity. The sun, not\r\nyet far above the horizon, threw a rosy light over the steely silkiness\r\nof its broad surface. Five carpenters were busy about the raft, a\r\nnewly-painted boat was lightly rocking from side to side, creating a\r\ngentle ripple over the water. The men rarely spoke, and then in somewhat\r\npreoccupied tones. Everything was submerged in the morning stillness,\r\nand everyone was occupied with the morning work; the whole gave one a\r\nfeeling of order and regularity of everyday life. Suddenly, at the other\r\nend of the avenue, Nejdanov got a vision of the very incarnation of\r\norder and regularity—Sipiagin himself.\r\n\r\nHe wore a brown coat, something like a dressing gown, and a checkered\r\ncap; he was leaning on an English bamboo cane, and his newly-shaven face\r\nshone with satisfaction; he was on the round of inspecting his estate.\r\nSipiagin greeted Nejdanov kindly.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” he exclaimed, “I see you are one of the early birds!” (He\r\nevidently wanted to express his approval by this old saying, which was\r\na little out of place, of the fact that Nejdanov, like himself, did not\r\nlike lying in bed long.) “At eight o’clock we all take tea in the dining\r\nroom, and we usually breakfast at twelve. I should like you to give\r\nKolia his first lesson in Russian grammar at ten o’clock, and a lesson\r\nin history at two. I don’t want him to have any lessons tomorrow, as it\r\nwill be his name-day, but I would like you to begin today.”\r\n\r\nNejdanov bowed his head, and Sipiagin took leave of him in the French\r\nfashion, quickly lifting his hand several times to his lips and nose,\r\nand walked away, whistling and waving his cane energetically, not at all\r\nlike an important official and state dignitary, but like a jolly Russian\r\ncountry gentleman.\r\n\r\nUntil eight o’clock Nejdanov stayed in the garden, enjoying the shadows\r\ncast by the old trees, the fresh air, the singing of the birds, until\r\nthe sound of a gong called him to the house. On his entrance he found\r\nthe whole company already assembled in the dining room. Valentina\r\nMihailovna greeted him in a friendly manner; she seemed to him\r\nmarvellously beautiful in her morning gown. Mariana looked stern and\r\nserious as usual.\r\n\r\nExactly at ten o’clock Nejdanov gave Kolia his first lesson before\r\nValentina Mihailovna, who had asked him if she might be present, and sat\r\nvery quietly the whole time. Kolia proved an intelligent boy; after the\r\ninevitable moments of incertitude and discomfort, the lesson went\r\noff very well, and Valentina Mihailovna was evidently satisfied with\r\nNejdanov, and spoke to him several times kindly. He tried to hold aloof\r\na little—but not too much so. Valentina Mihailovna was also present at\r\nthe second lesson, this time on Russian history. She announced, with\r\na smile, that in this subject she needed instruction almost as much\r\nas Kolia. She conducted herself just as quietly as she had done at the\r\nfirst lesson.\r\n\r\nBetween two and five o’clock Nejdanov stayed in his own room writing\r\nletters to his St. Petersburg friends. He was neither bored nor in\r\ndespair; his overstrained nerves had calmed down somewhat. However, they\r\nwere set on edge again at dinner, although Kollomietzev was not present,\r\nand the kind attention of host and hostess remained unchanged; but it\r\nwas this very attention that made Nejdanov angry. To make matters worse,\r\nthe old maiden lady, Anna Zaharovna, was obviously antagonistic, Mariana\r\ncontinued serious, and Kolia rather unceremoniously kicked him under the\r\ntable. Sipiagin also seemed out of sorts. He was extremely dissatisfied\r\nwith the manager of his paper mill, a German, to whom he paid a large\r\nsalary. Sipiagin began by abusing Germans in general, then announced\r\nthat he was somewhat of a Slavophil, though not a fanatic, and mentioned\r\na certain young Russian, by the name of Solomin, who, it was said,\r\nhad successfully established another mill belonging to a neighbouring\r\nmerchant; he was very anxious to meet this Solomin.\r\n\r\nKollomietzev came in the evening; his own estate was only about ten\r\nmiles away from “Arjanov,” the name of Sipiagin’s village. There also\r\ncame a certain justice of the peace, a squire, of the kind so admirably\r\ndescribed in the two famous lines of Lermontov—\r\n\r\n  Behind a cravat, frock coat to the heels...\r\n  Moustache, squeaky voice—and heavy glance.\r\n\r\nAnother guest arrived, with a dejected look, without a tooth in his\r\nhead, but very accurately dressed. After him came the local doctor, a\r\nvery bad doctor, who was fond of coming out with learned expressions.\r\nHe assured everyone, for instance, that he liked Kukolnik better than\r\nPushkin because there was a great deal of “protoplasm” about him. They\r\nall sat down to play cards. Nejdanov retired to his own room, and read\r\nand wrote until midnight.\r\n\r\nThe following day, the 9th of May, was Kolia’s patron-saint’s day.\r\n\r\nAlthough the church was not a quarter of a mile off, the whole household\r\ndrove to mass in three open carriages with footmen at the back.\r\nEverything was very festive and gorgeous. Sipiagin decorated himself\r\nwith his order, Valentina Mihailovna was dressed in a beautiful pale\r\nlavender-coloured Parisian gown, and during the service read her prayers\r\nout of a tiny little prayer hook bound in red velvet. This little book\r\nwas a matter of great concern among several old peasants, one of whom,\r\nunable to contain himself any longer, asked of his neighbour: “What is\r\nshe doing? Lord have mercy on us! Is she casting a spell?” The sweet\r\nscent of the flowers, which filled the whole church, mingled with the\r\nsmell of the peasant’s coats, tarred boots and shoes, the whole being\r\ndrowned by the delicious, overpowering scent of incense.\r\n\r\nIn the choir the clerks and sacristans tried their very hardest to sing\r\nwell, and with the help of the men from the factory attempted something\r\nlike a concert! There was a moment when an almost painful sensation came\r\nover the congregation. The tenor’s voice (it belonged to one of the men\r\nfrom the factory, who was in the last stages of consumption) rose high\r\nabove the rest, and without the slightest restraint trilled out long\r\nchromatic flat minor notes; they were terrible these notes! but to stop\r\nthem would have meant the whole concert going to pieces. ... However,\r\nthe thing went off without any mishap. Father Kiprian, a priest of\r\nthe most patriarchal appearance, dressed in the full vestments of the\r\nchurch, delivered his sermon out of a copy-book. Unfortunately, the\r\nconscientious father had considered it necessary to introduce the names\r\nof several very wise Assyrian kings, which caused him some trouble in\r\npronunciation. He succeeded in showing a certain amount of learning, but\r\nperspired very much in the effort!\r\n\r\nNejdanov, who for a long time had not been inside a church, stood in a\r\ncorner amidst the peasant women, who kept casting sidelong glances at\r\nhim in between crossing themselves, bowing piously to the ground, and\r\nwiping their babies’ noses. But the peasant girls in their new coats\r\nand beaded head-dresses, and the boys in their embroidered shirts,\r\nwith girdles round their waists, stared intently at the new worshipper,\r\nturning their faces straight towards him.... Nejdanov, too, looked at\r\nthem, and many things rose up in his mind.\r\n\r\nAfter mass, which lasted a very long time—the service of St. Nikolai\r\nthe Miraculous is well known to be one of the longest in the Orthodox\r\nChurch—all the clergy, at Sipiagin’s invitation, returned to his\r\nhouse, and, after going through several additional ceremonies, such as\r\nsprinkling the room with holy water, they all sat down to an abundant\r\nbreakfast, interspersed with the usual congratulations and rather\r\nwearisome talk. The host and hostess, who never took breakfast at such\r\nan early hour, broke the rule on this occasion. Sipiagin even went so\r\nfar as to relate an anecdote, quite proper, of course, but nevertheless\r\namusing, in spite of his dignity and red ribbon, and caused Father\r\nKiprian to be filled with gratitude and amazement. To show that he, too,\r\ncould tell something worth hearing on occasion, the good father related\r\na conversation he had had with the bishop, when the latter, on a tour\r\nround his diocese, had invited all the clergy of the district to come\r\nand see him at the monastery in the town. “He is very severe with us,”\r\n Father Kiprian assured everyone. “First he questioned us about our\r\nparish, about our arrangements, and then he began to examine us....\r\nHe turned to me also: ‘What is your church’s dedication day?’ ‘The\r\nTransfiguration of our Lord,’ I replied. ‘Do you know the hymn for that\r\nday?’ ‘I think so.’ ‘Sing it.’ ‘Thou wert transfigured on the mountain,\r\nChrist our Lord,’ I began. ‘Stop! Do you know the meaning of the\r\nTransfiguration?’ ‘To be quite brief,’ I replied, ‘our Lord wished to\r\nshow himself to His disciples in all His glory.’ ‘Very well,’ he said,\r\n‘here is a little image in memory of me.’ I fell at his feet. ‘I thank\r\nyou, your Holiness....’ I did not go away from him empty-handed.”\r\n\r\n“I have the honour of knowing his Holiness personally,” Sipiagin said\r\nsolemnly. “A most worthy pastor!”\r\n\r\n“Most worthy!” Father Kiprian agreed; “only he puts too much faith in\r\nthe ecclesiastical superintendents!”\r\n\r\nValentina Mihailovna referred to the peasant school, and spoke of\r\nMariana as the future schoolmistress; the deacon (who had been appointed\r\nsupervisor of the school), a man of strong athletic build, with long\r\nwaving hair, bearing a faint resemblance to the well-groomed tail of an\r\nOrlov race courser, quite forgetting his vocal powers, gave forth such a\r\nvolume of sound as to confuse himself and frighten everybody else. Soon\r\nafter this the clergy took their leave.\r\n\r\nKolia, in his new coat decorated with golden buttons, was the hero of\r\nthe day. He was given presents, he was congratulated, his hands were\r\nkissed at the front door and at the back door by servants, workmen from\r\nthe factory, old women and young girls and peasants; the latter, in\r\nmemory of the days of serfdom, hung around the tables in front of the\r\nhouse, spread out with pies and small bottles of vodka. The happy boy\r\nwas shy and pleased and proud, all at the same time; he caressed his\r\nparents and ran out of the room. At dinner Sipiagin ordered champagne,\r\nand before drinking his son’s health made a speech. He spoke of the\r\nsignificance of “serving the land,” and indicated the road he wished his\r\nNikolai to follow (he did not use the diminutive of the boy’s name),\r\nof the duty he owed, first to his family; secondly to his class, to\r\nsociety; thirdly to the people—“Yes, my dear ladies and gentlemen, to\r\nthe people; and fourthly, to the government!” By degrees Sipiagin became\r\nquite eloquent, with his hand under the tail of his coat in imitation of\r\nRobert Peel. He pronounced the word “science” with emotion, and finished\r\nhis speech by the Latin exclamation, _laboremus!_ which he instantly\r\ntranslated into Russian. Kolia, with a glass in his hand, went over to\r\nthank his father and to be kissed by the others.\r\n\r\nNejdanov exchanged glances with Mariana again....\r\n\r\nThey no doubt felt the same, but they did not speak to each other.\r\n\r\nHowever, Nejdanov was more amused than annoyed with the whole\r\nproceeding, and the amiable hostess, Valentina Mihailovna, seemed to him\r\nto be an intelligent woman, who was aware that she was playing a part,\r\nbut pleased to think that there was someone else intelligent enough\r\nto understand her. Nejdanov probably had no suspicion of the degree in\r\nwhich he was flattered by her attitude towards him.\r\n\r\nOn the following day lessons were renewed, and life fell back in its\r\nordinary rut.\r\n\r\nA week flew by in this way. Nejdanov’s thoughts and experiences during\r\nthat time may be best gathered from an extract of a letter he wrote to\r\na certain Silin, an old school chum and his best friend. Silin did not\r\nlive in St. Petersburg, but in a distant provincial town, with an old\r\nrelative on whom he was entirely dependent. His position was such that\r\nhe could hardly dream of ever getting away from there. He was a man of\r\nvery poor health, timid, of limited capacity, but of an extraordinarily\r\npure nature. He did not interest himself in politics, but read anything\r\nthat came in his way, played on the flute as a resource against\r\nboredom, and was afraid of young ladies. Silin was passionately fond\r\nof Nejdanov—he had an affectionate heart in general. Nejdanov did not\r\nexpress himself to anyone as freely as he did to Vladimir Silin; when\r\nwriting to him he felt as if he were communicating to some dear and\r\nintimate soul, dwelling in another world, or to his own conscience.\r\nNejdanov could not for a moment conceive of the idea of living together\r\nagain with Silin, as comrades in the same town. He would probably have\r\nlost interest in him, as there was little in common between them, but he\r\nwrote him long letters gladly with the fullest confidence. With others,\r\non paper at any rate, he was not himself, but this never happened when\r\nwriting to Silin. The latter was not a master in the art of writing, and\r\nresponded only in short clumsy sentences, but Nejdanov had no need of\r\nlengthy replies; he knew quite well that his friend swallowed every\r\nword of his, as the dust in the road swallows each drop of rain, that\r\nhe would keep his secrets sacredly, and that in his hopeless solitude he\r\nhad no other interests but his, Nejdanov’s, interests. He had never told\r\nanyone of his relation with Silin, a relation that was very dear to him.\r\n\r\n“Well, my dear friend, my pure-hearted Vladimir!” Thus he wrote to\r\nhim; he always called him pure-hearted, and not without good cause.\r\n“Congratulate me; I have fallen upon green pasture, and can rest awhile\r\nand gather strength. I am living in the house of a rich statesman,\r\nSipiagin, as tutor to his little son; I eat well (have never eaten\r\nso well in my life!), sleep well, and wander about the beautiful\r\ncountry—but, above all, I have for a time crept out from under the wing\r\nof my St. Petersburg friends. At first it was horribly boring, but I\r\nfeel a bit better now. I shall soon have to go into harness again, that\r\nis, put up with the consequences of what I have undertaken (the reason\r\nI was allowed to come here). For a time, at any rate, I can enjoy the\r\ndelights of a purely animal existence, expand in the waist, and write\r\nverses if the mood seizes me. I will give you my observations another\r\ntime. The estate seems to me well managed on the whole, with the\r\nexception, perhaps, of the factory, which is not quite right; some of\r\nthe peasants are unapproachable, and the hired servants have servile\r\nfaces—but we can talk about these things later on. My host and\r\nhostess are courteous, liberal-minded people; the master is for\r\never condescending, and bursts out from time to time in torrents of\r\neloquence, a most highly cultured person! His lady, a picturesque\r\nbeauty, who has all her wits about her, keeps such a close watch on\r\none, and is so soft! I should think she has not a bone in her body! I am\r\nrather afraid of her, you know what sort of a ladies’ man I make! There\r\nare neighbours—but uninteresting ones; then there is an old lady in the\r\nhouse who makes me feel uncomfortable.... Above all, I am interested\r\nin a certain young lady, but whether she is a relative or simply a\r\ncompanion here the Lord only knows! I have scarcely exchanged a couple\r\nof words with her, but I feel that we are birds of a feather....”\r\n\r\nHere followed a description of Mariana’s personal appearance and of all\r\nher habits; then he continued:\r\n\r\n“That she is unhappy, proud, ambitious, reserved, but above all\r\nunhappy, I have not the smallest doubt. But why she is unhappy, I have\r\nas yet failed to discover. That she has an upright nature is quite\r\nevident, but whether she is good-natured or not remains to be seen. Are\r\nthere really any good-natured women other than stupid ones? Is goodness\r\nessential? However, I know little about women. The lady of the house\r\ndoes not like her, and I believe it is mutual on either side.... But\r\nwhich of them is in the right is difficult to say. I think that the\r\nmistress is probably in the wrong ... because she is so awfully polite\r\nto her; the _other’s_ brows twitch nervously when she is speaking to\r\nher patroness. She is a most highly-strong individual, like myself, and\r\nis just as easily _upset_ as I am, although perhaps not in the same way.\r\n\r\n“When all this can be disentangled, I will write to you again.\r\n\r\n“She hardly ever speaks to me, as I have already told you, but in the\r\nfew words she has addressed to me (always rather sudden and unexpected)\r\nthere was a ring of rough sincerity which I liked. By the way, how long\r\nis that relative of yours going to bore you to death? When is he going\r\nto die?\r\n\r\n“Have you read the article in the ‘European Messenger’ about the latest\r\nimpostors in the province of Orenburg? It happened in 1834, my dear! I\r\ndon’t like the journal, and the writer of the article is a conservative,\r\nbut the thing is interesting and calculated to give one ideas....”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nMay had reached its second half; the first hot summer days had already\r\nset in.\r\n\r\nAfter his history lesson one day, Nejdanov wandered out into the garden,\r\nand from thence into a birch wood adjoining it on one side. Certain\r\nparts of this wood had been cleared by merchants about fifteen years\r\nago, but these clearings were already densely overgrown by young\r\nbirches, whose soft silver trunks encircled by grey rings rose as\r\nstraight as pillars, and whose bright green leaves sparkled as if they\r\nhad just been washed and polished. The grass shot up in sharp tongues\r\nthrough the even layers of last year’s fallen leaves. Little narrow\r\npaths ran here and there, from which yellow-beaked blackbirds rose with\r\nstartled cries, flying close to the earth into the wood as hard as they\r\ncould go.\r\n\r\nAfter wandering about for half an hour, Nejdanov sat down on the stump\r\nof a tree, surrounded by old greyish splinters, lying in heaps, exactly\r\nas they had fallen when cut down by the axe. Many a time had these\r\nsplinters been covered by the winter’s snow and been thawed by the\r\nspring sun, but nobody had touched them.\r\n\r\nNejdanov leaned against a solid wall of young birches casting a heavy\r\nthough mild shade. He was not thinking of anything in particular, but\r\ngave himself up to those peculiar sensations of spring which in the\r\nheart of young and old alike are always mixed with a certain degree of\r\nsadness—the keen sadness of awaiting in the young and of settled regret\r\nin the old.\r\n\r\nNejdanov was suddenly awakened by approaching footsteps.\r\n\r\nIt did not sound like the footsteps of one person, nor like a peasant in\r\nheavy boots, or a barefooted peasant woman; it seemed as if two people\r\nwere advancing at a slow, measured pace. The slight rustling of a\r\nwoman’s dress was heard.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a deep man’s voice was heard to say:\r\n\r\n“Is this your last word? Never?”\r\n\r\n“Never!” a familiar woman’s voice repeated, and a moment later from a\r\nbend in the path, hidden from view by a young tree, Mariana appeared,\r\naccompanied by a swarthy man with black eyes, an individual whom\r\nNejdanov had never seen before.\r\n\r\nThey both stood still as if rooted to the spot on catching sight of him,\r\nand he was so taken aback that he did not rise from the stump he was\r\nsitting on. Mariana blushed to the roots of her hair, but instantly\r\ngave a contemptuous smile. It was difficult to say whether the smile was\r\nmeant for herself, for having blushed, or for Nejdanov. Her companion\r\nscowled—a sinister gleam was seen in the yellowish whites of his\r\ntroubled eyes. He exchanged glances with Mariana, and without saying a\r\nword they turned their backs on Nejdanov and walked away as slowly as\r\nthey had come, while Nejdanov followed them with a look of amazement.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later he returned home to his room, and when, at the sound\r\nof the gong, he appeared in the drawing room, the dark-eyed stranger\r\nwhom he had seen in the wood was already there. Sipiagin introduced\r\nNejdanov to him as his _beaufrère’a_, Valentina Mihailovna’s\r\nbrother—Sergai Mihailovitch Markelov.\r\n\r\n“I hope you will get to know each other and be friends, gentlemen,”\r\n Sipiagin exclaimed with the amiable, stately, though absent-minded smile\r\ncharacteristic of him.\r\n\r\nMarkelov bowed silently; Nejdanov responded in a similar way, and\r\nSipiagin, throwing back his head slightly and shrugging his shoulders,\r\nwalked away, as much as to say, “I’ve brought you together, but whether\r\nyou become friends or not is a matter of equal indifference to me!”\r\n\r\nValentina Mihailovna came up to the silent pair, standing motionless,\r\nand introduced them to each other over again; she then turned to her\r\nbrother with that peculiarly bright, caressing expression which she\r\nseemed able to summon at will into her wonderful eyes.\r\n\r\n“Why, my dear _Serge_, you’ve quite forgotten us! You did not even come\r\non Kolia’s nameday. Are you so very busy? My brother is making some\r\nsort of new arrangement with his peasants,” she remarked, turning to\r\nNejdanov. “So very original—three parts of everything for them and one\r\nfor himself; even then he thinks that he gets more than his share.”\r\n\r\n“My sister is fond of joking,” Markelov said to Nejdanov in his turn,\r\n“but I am prepared to agree with her; for _one_ man to take a quarter\r\nof what belongs to a _hundred_, is certainly too much.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think that I am fond of joking, Alexai Dmitritch?” Madame\r\nSipiagina asked with that same caressing softness in her voice and in\r\nher eyes.\r\n\r\nNejdanov was at a loss for a reply, but just then Kollomietzev was\r\nannounced. The hostess went to meet him, and a few moments later a\r\nservant appeared and announced in a sing-song voice that dinner was\r\nready.\r\n\r\nAt dinner Nejdanov could not keep his eyes off Mariana and Markelov.\r\nThey sat side by side, both with downcast eyes, compressed lips, and an\r\nexpression of gloomy severity on their angry faces. Nejdanov wondered\r\nhow Markelov could possibly be Madame Sipiagina’s brother; they were so\r\nlittle like each other. There was only one point of resemblance\r\nbetween them, their dark complexions; but the even colour of Valentina\r\nMihailovna’s face, arms, and shoulders constituted one of her charms,\r\nwhile in her brother it reached to that shade of swarthiness which\r\npolite people call “bronze,” but which to the Russian eye suggests a\r\nbrown leather boot-leg.\r\n\r\nMarkelov had curly hair, a somewhat hooked nose, thick lips, sunken\r\ncheeks, a narrow chest, and sinewy hands. He was dry and sinewy all\r\nover, and spoke in a curt, harsh, metallic voice. The sleepy look\r\nin his eyes, the gloomy expression, denoted a bilious temperament!\r\nHe ate very little, amused himself by making bread pills, and every\r\nnow and again would fix his eyes on Kollomietzev. The latter had\r\njust returned from town, where he had been to see the governor upon\r\na rather unpleasant matter for himself, upon which he kept a tacit\r\nsilence, but was very voluble about everything else. Sipiagin sat on\r\nhim somewhat when he went a little too far, but laughed a good deal at\r\nhis anecdotes and _bon mots_, although he thought _qu’il est un affreux\r\nréactionnaire_. Kollomietzev declared, among other things, how he went\r\ninto raptures at what the peasants, _oui, oui! les simples mougiks!_\r\ncall lawyers. “Liars! Liars!” he shouted with delight. _“Ce peuple\r\nrusse est délicieux!”_ He then went on to say how once, when going\r\nthrough a village school, he asked one of the children what a babugnia\r\nwas, and nobody could tell him, not even the teacher himself. He then\r\nasked what a pithecus was, and no one knew even that, although he had\r\nquoted the poet Himnitz, ‘The weakwitted pithecus that mocks the other\r\nbeasts.’ Such is the deplorable condition of our peasant schools!\r\n\r\n“But,” Valentina Mihailovna remarked, “I don’t know myself what are\r\nthese animals!”\r\n\r\n“Madame!” Kollomietzev exclaimed, “there is no necessity for you to\r\nknow!”\r\n\r\n“Then why should the peasants know?”\r\n\r\n“Because it is better for them to know about these animals than about\r\nProudhon or Adam Smith!”\r\n\r\nHere Sipiagin again intervened, saying that Adam Smith was one of the\r\nleading lights in human thought, and that it would be well to imbibe his\r\nprinciples (he poured himself out a glass of wine) with the (he lifted\r\nthe glass to his nose and sniffed at it) mother’s milk! He swallowed the\r\nwine. Kollomietzev also drank a glass and praised it highly.\r\n\r\nMarkelov payed no special attention to Kollomietzev’s talk, but glanced\r\ninterrogatively at Nejdanov once or twice; he flicked one of his little\r\nbread pills, which just missed the nose of the eloquent guest.\r\n\r\nSipiagin left his brother-in-law in peace; neither did Valentina\r\nMihailovna speak to him; it was evident that both husband and wife\r\nconsidered Markelov an eccentric sort of person whom it was better not\r\nto provoke.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner Markelov went into the billiard room to smoke a pipe, and\r\nNejdanov withdrew into his own room.\r\n\r\nIn the corridor he ran against Mariana. He wanted to slip past her, when\r\nshe stopped him with a quick movement of the hand.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Nejdanov,” she said in a somewhat unsteady tone of voice, “it ought\r\nto be all the same to me what you think of me, but still I find it... I\r\nfind it...” (she could not think of a fitting word) “I find it necessary\r\nto tell you that when you met me in the wood today with Mr. Markelov...\r\nyou must no doubt have thought, when you saw us both confused, that we\r\nhad come there by appointment.”\r\n\r\n“It did seem a little strange to me—” Nejdanov began. “Mr. Markelov,”\r\n Mariana interrupted him, “proposed to me... and I refused him. That is\r\nall I wanted to say to you. Goodnight. Think what you like of me.”\r\n\r\nShe turned away and walked quickly down the corridor.\r\n\r\nNejdanov entered his own room and sat down by the window musing. “What\r\na strange girl—why this wild issue, this uninvited explanation? Is it a\r\ndesire to be original, or simply affectation—or pride? Pride, no doubt.\r\nShe can’t endure the idea... the faintest suspicion, that anyone should\r\nhave a wrong opinion of her. What a strange girl!”\r\n\r\nThus Nejdanov pondered, while he was being discussed on the terrace\r\nbelow; every word could be heard distinctly.\r\n\r\n“I have a feeling,” Kollomietzev declared, “a feeling, that he’s\r\na revolutionist. When I served on a special commission at the\r\ngovernor-general’s of Moscow _avec Ladislas_, I learned to scent these\r\ngentlemen as well as nonconformists. I believe in instinct above\r\neverything.” Here Kollomietzev related how he had once caught an old\r\nsectarian by the heel somewhere near Moscow, on whom he had looked in,\r\naccompanied by the police, and who nearly jumped out of his cottage\r\nwindow. “He was sitting quite quietly on his bench until that moment,\r\nthe blackguard!”\r\n\r\nKollomietzev forgot to add that this old man, when put into prison,\r\nrefused to take any food and starved himself to death.\r\n\r\n“And your new tutor,” Kollomietzev went on zealously, “is a\r\nrevolutionist, without a shadow of a doubt! Have you noticed that he is\r\nnever the first to bow to anyone?”\r\n\r\n“Why should he?” Madame Sipiagina asked; “on the contrary, that is what\r\nI like about him.”\r\n\r\n“I am a guest in the house in which he serves,” Kollomietzev exclaimed,\r\n“yes, serves for money, _comme un salarié_.... Consequently I am his\r\nsuperior.... He _ought_ to bow to me first.”\r\n\r\n“My dear Kollomietzev, you are very particular,” Sipiagin put in,\r\nlaying special stress on the word _dear_. “I thought, if you’ll forgive\r\nmy saying so, that we had outgrown all that. I pay for his services,\r\nhis work, but he remains a free man.”\r\n\r\n“He does not feel the bridle, _le frein!_ All these revolutionists are\r\nlike that. I tell you I can smell them from afar! Only _Ladislas_ can\r\ncompare with me in this respect. If this tutor were to fall into my\r\nhands wouldn’t I give it to him! I would make him sing a very different\r\ntune! How he would begin touching his cap to me—it would be a pleasure\r\nto see him!”\r\n\r\n“Rubbish, you swaggering little braggart!” Nejdanov almost shouted\r\nfrom above, but at this moment the door opened and, to his great\r\nastonishment, Markelov entered the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nNejdanov rose to meet him, and Markelov, coming straight up to him,\r\nwithout any form of greeting, asked him if he was Alexai Dmitritch, a\r\nstudent of the St. Petersburg University.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” Nejdanov replied.\r\n\r\nMarkelov took an unsealed letter out of a side pocket.\r\n\r\n“In that case, please read this. It is from Vassily Nikolaevitch,” he\r\nadded, lowering his voice significantly.\r\n\r\nNejdanov unfolded and read the letter. It was a semi-official circular\r\nin which Sergai Markelov was introduced as one of “us,” and absolutely\r\ntrustworthy; then followed some advice about the urgent necessity of\r\nunited action in the propaganda of their well-known principles.\r\nThe circular was addressed to Nejdanov, as being a person worthy of\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\nNejdanov extended his hand to Markelov, offered him a chair, and sat\r\ndown himself.\r\n\r\nMarkelov, without saying a word, began lighting a cigarette; Nejdanov\r\nfollowed his example.\r\n\r\n“Have you managed to come in contact with the peasants here?” Markelov\r\nasked at last.\r\n\r\n“No, I haven’t had time as yet.”\r\n\r\n“How long have you been here?”\r\n\r\n“About a fortnight.”\r\n\r\n“Have you much to do?”\r\n\r\n“Not very much.”\r\n\r\nMarkelov gave a severe cough.\r\n\r\n“H’m! The people here are stupid enough. A most ignorant lot. They\r\nmust be enlightened. They’re wretchedly poor, but one can’t make them\r\nunderstand the cause of their poverty.”\r\n\r\n“Your brother-in-law’s old serfs, as far as one can judge, do not seem\r\nto be poor,” Nejdanov remarked.\r\n\r\n“My brother-in-law knows what he is about; he is a perfect master at\r\nhumbugging people. His peasants are certainly not so badly off; but he\r\nhas a factory; that is where we must turn our attention. The slightest\r\ndig there will make the ants move. Have you any books with you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, a few.”\r\n\r\n“I will get you some more. How is it you have so few?”\r\n\r\nNejdanov made no reply. Markelov also ceased, and began sending out\r\npuffs of smoke through his nostrils.\r\n\r\n“What a pig this Kollomietzev is!” he exclaimed suddenly. “At dinner I\r\ncould scarcely keep from rushing at him and smashing his impudent face\r\nas a warning to others. But no, there are more important things to be\r\ndone just now. There is no time to waste getting angry with fools for\r\nsaying stupid things. The time has now come to prevent them _doing_\r\nstupid things.”\r\n\r\nNejdanov nodded his head and Markelov went on smoking. “Among the\r\nservants here there is only one who is any good,” he began again. “Not\r\nyour man, Ivan, he has no more sense than a fish, but another one,\r\nKirill, the butler.” (Kirill was known to be a confirmed drunkard.)\r\n“He is a drunken debauchee, but we can’t be too particular. What do you\r\nthink of my sister?” he asked, suddenly fixing his yellowish eyes on\r\nNejdanov. “She is even more artful than my brother-in-law. What do you\r\nthink of her?”\r\n\r\n“I think that she is a very kind and pleasant lady...besides, she is\r\nvery beautiful.”\r\n\r\n“H’m! With what subtlety you St. Petersburg gentlemen express\r\nyourselves! I can only marvel at it. Well, and what about—” he began,\r\nbut his face darkened suddenly, and he did not finish the sentence. “I\r\nsee that we must have a good talk,” he went on. “It is quite impossible\r\nhere. Who knows! They may be listening at the door. I have a suggestion.\r\nToday is Saturday; you won’t be giving lessons to my nephew tomorrow,\r\nwill you?”\r\n\r\n“I have a rehearsal with him at three o’clock.”\r\n\r\n“A rehearsal! It sounds like the stage. My sister, no doubt, invented\r\nthe word. Well, no matter. Would you like to come home with me now? My\r\nvillage is about ten miles off. I have some excellent horses who will\r\nget us there in a twinkling. You could stay the night and the morning,\r\nand I could bring you back by three o’clock tomorrow. Will you come?”\r\n\r\n“With pleasure,” Nejdanov replied. Ever since Markelov’s appearance he\r\nhad been in a state of great excitement and embarrassment. This sudden\r\nintimacy made him feel ill at ease, but he was nevertheless drawn to\r\nhim. He felt certain that the man before him was of a sufficiently blunt\r\nnature, but for all that honest and full of strength. Moreover, the\r\nstrange meeting in the wood, Mariana’s unexpected explanation....\r\n\r\n“Very well!” Markelov exclaimed. “You can get ready while I order the\r\ncarriage to be brought out. By the way, I hope you won’t have to ask\r\npermission of our host and hostess.”\r\n\r\n“I must tell them. I don’t think it would be wise to go away without\r\ndoing so.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell them,” Markelov said. “They are engrossed in their cards just\r\nnow and will not notice your absence. My brother-in-law aims only at\r\ngovernmental folk, and the only thing he can do well is to play at\r\ncards. However, it is said that many succeed in getting what they\r\nwant through such means. You’ll get ready, won’t you? I’ll make all\r\narrangements immediately.”\r\n\r\nMarkelov withdrew, and an hour later Nejdanov sat by his side on the\r\nbroad leather-cushioned seat of his comfortable old carriage. The little\r\ncoachman on the box kept on whistling in wonderfully pleasant bird-like\r\nnotes; three piebald horses, with plaited manes and tails, flew like\r\nthe wind over the smooth even road; and already enveloped in the first\r\nshadows of the night (it was exactly ten o’clock when they started),\r\ntrees, bushes, fields, meadows, and ditches, some in the foreground,\r\nothers in the background, sailed swiftly towards them.\r\n\r\nMarkelov’s tiny little village, Borsionkov, consisting of about two\r\nhundred acres in all, and bringing him in an income of seven hundred\r\nroubles a year, was situated about three miles away from the provincial\r\ntown, seven miles off from Sipiagin’s village. To get to Borsionkov from\r\nSipiagin’s, one had to go through the town. Our new friends had scarcely\r\ntime to exchange a hundred words when glimpses of the mean little\r\ndwellings of shopkeepers on the outskirts of the town flashed past them,\r\nlittle dwellings with shabby wooden roofs, from which faint patches\r\nof light could be seen through crooked little windows; the wheels soon\r\nrattled over the town bridge, paved with cobble stones; the carriage\r\ngave a jerk, rocked from side to side, and swaying with every jolt,\r\nrolled past the stupid two-storied stone houses, with imposing frontals,\r\ninhabited by merchants, past the church, ornamented with pillars,\r\npast the shops.... It was Saturday night and the streets were already\r\ndeserted—only the taverns were still filled with people. Hoarse drunken\r\nvoices issued from them, singing, accompanied by the hideous sounds of\r\na concertina. Every now and again a door opened suddenly, letting forth\r\nthe red reflection of a rush-light and a filthy, overpowering smell of\r\nalcohol. Almost before every tavern door stood little peasant carts,\r\nharnessed with shaggy, big-bellied, miserable-looking hacks, whose heads\r\nwere bowed submissively as if asleep; a tattered, unbelted peasant in a\r\nbig winter cap, hanging like a sack at the back of his head, came out\r\nof a tavern door, and leaning his breast against the shafts, stood there\r\nhelplessly fumbling at something with his hands; or a meagre-looking\r\nfactory worker, his cap awry, his shirt unfastened, barefooted, his\r\nboots having been left inside, would take a few uncertain steps, stop\r\nstill, scratch his back, groan suddenly, and turn in again....\r\n\r\n“Drink will be the ruin of the Russian!” Markelov remarked gloomily.\r\n\r\n“It’s from grief, Sergai Mihailovitch,” the coachman said without\r\nturning round. He ceased whistling on passing each tavern and seemed to\r\nsink into his own thoughts.\r\n\r\n“Go on! Go on!” Markelov shouted angrily, vigorously tugging at his own\r\ncoat collar. They drove through the wide market square reeking with the\r\nsmell of rush mats and cabbages, past the governor’s house with coloured\r\nsentry boxes standing at the gate, past a private house with turrets,\r\npast the boulevard newly planted with trees that were already dying,\r\npast the hotel court-yard, filled with the barking of dogs and the\r\nclanging of chains, and so on through the town gates, where they\r\novertook a long, long line of waggons, whose drivers had taken advantage\r\nof the evening coolness, then out into the open country, where they\r\nrolled along more swiftly and evenly over the broad road, planted on\r\neither side with willows.\r\n\r\nWe must now say a few words about Markelov. He was six years older than\r\nhis sister, Madame Sipiagina, and had been educated at an artillery\r\nschool, which he left as an ensign, but sent in his resignation when he\r\nhad reached the rank of lieutenant, owing to a certain unpleasantness\r\nthat passed between him and his commanding officer, a German. Ever\r\nsince then he always detested Germans, especially Russian Germans. He\r\nquarrelled with his father on account of his resignation, and never\r\nsaw him again until just before his death, after which he inherited the\r\nlittle property and settled on it. In St. Petersburg he often came in\r\ncontact with various brilliant people of advanced views, whom he simply\r\nworshipped, and who finally brought him around to their way of thinking.\r\nMarkelov had read little, mostly books relating to the thing that\r\nchiefly interested him, and was especially attached to Herzen. He\r\nretained his military habits, and lived like a Spartan and a monk. A few\r\nyears ago he fell passionately in love with a girl who threw him over in\r\na most unceremonious manner and married an adjutant, also a German. He\r\nconsequently hated adjutants too. He tried to write a series of special\r\narticles on the shortcomings of our artillery, but had not the remotest\r\nidea of exposition and never finished a single article; he continued,\r\nhowever, covering large sheets of grey paper with his large, awkward,\r\nchildish handwriting. Markelov was a man obstinate and fearless to\r\ndesperation, never forgiving or forgetting, with a constant sense\r\nof injury done to himself and to all the oppressed, and prepared for\r\nanything. His limited mind was for ever knocking against one point; what\r\nwas beyond his comprehension did not exist, but he loathed and\r\ndespised all deceit and falsehood. With the upper classes, with the\r\n“reactionaries” as he called them, he was severe and even rude, but\r\nwith the people he was simple, and treated a peasant like a brother.\r\nHe managed his property fairly well, his head was full of all sorts\r\nof socialist schemes, which he could no more put into practice than he\r\ncould finish his articles on the shortcomings of the artillery. He never\r\nsucceeded in anything, and was known in his regiment as “the failure.”\r\n Of a sincere, passionate, and morbid nature, he could at a given moment\r\nappear merciless, blood-thirsty, deserving to be called a brute; at\r\nanother, he would be ready to sacrifice himself without a moment’s\r\nhesitation and without any idea of reward.\r\n\r\nAt about two miles away from the town the carriage plunged suddenly into\r\nthe soft darkness of an aspen wood, amidst the rustling of invisible\r\nleaves, the fresh moist odour of the forest, with faint patches of light\r\nfrom above and a mass of tangled shadows below. The moon had already\r\nrisen above the horizon, broad and red like a copper shield. Emerging\r\nfrom the trees, the carriage came upon a small low farm house. Three\r\nilluminated windows stood out sharply on the front of the house, which\r\nshut out the moon’s disc; the wide, open gate looked as if it was never\r\nshut. Two white stage-horses, attached to the back of a high trap, were\r\nstanding in the courtyard, half in obscurity; two puppies, also white,\r\nrushed out from somewhere and gave forth piercing, though harmless,\r\nbarks. People were seen moving in the house—the carriage rolled up to\r\nthe doorstep, and Markelov, climbing out and feeling with difficulty for\r\nthe iron carriage step, put on, as is usually the case, by the domestic\r\nblacksmith in the most inconvenient possible place, said to Nejdanov:\r\n“Here we are at home. You will find guests here whom you know very well,\r\nbut little expect to meet. Come in, please.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nThe guests turned out to be no other than our old friends Mashurina and\r\nOstrodumov. They were both sitting in the poorly-furnished drawing\r\nroom of Markelov’s house, smoking and drinking beer by the light of\r\na kerosene lamp. Neither of them showed the least astonishment when\r\nNejdanov came in, knowing beforehand that Markelov had intended bringing\r\nhim back, but Nejdanov was very much surprised on seeing them. On his\r\nentrance Ostrodumov merely muttered “Good evening,” whilst Mashurina\r\nturned scarlet and extended her hand. Markelov began to explain that\r\nthey had come from St. Petersburg about a week ago, Ostrodumov to remain\r\nin the province for some time for propaganda purposes, while Mashurina\r\nwas to go on to K. to meet someone, also in connection with the cause.\r\nHe then went on to say that the time had now come for them to do\r\nsomething practical, and became suddenly heated, although no one had\r\ncontradicted him. He bit his lips, and in a hoarse, excited tone of\r\nvoice began condemning the horrors that were taking place, saying that\r\neverything was now in readiness for them to start, that none but cowards\r\ncould hold back, that a certain amount of violence was just as necessary\r\nas the prick of the lancet to the abscess, however ripe it might be! The\r\nlancet simile was not original, but one that he had heard somewhere. He\r\nseemed to like it, and made use of it on every possible occasion.\r\n\r\nLosing all hope of Mariana’s love, it seemed that he no longer cared\r\nfor anything, and was only eager to get to work, to enter the field of\r\naction as soon as possible. He spoke harshly, angrily, but straight to\r\nthe point like the blow of an axe, his words falling from his pale lips\r\nmonotonously, ponderously, like the savage bark of a grim old watch dog.\r\nHe said that he was well acquainted with both the peasants and factory\r\nmen of the neighbourhood, and that there were possible people among\r\nthem. Instanced a certain Eremy, who, he declared, was prepared to go\r\nanywhere at a moment’s notice. This man, Eremy, who belonged to the\r\nvillage Goloplok, was constantly on his lips. At nearly every tenth word\r\nhe thumped his right hand on the table and waved the left in the air,\r\nthe forefinger standing away from the others. This sinewy, hairy\r\nhand, the finger, hoarse voice, flashing eyes, all produced a strong\r\nimpression on his hearers.\r\n\r\nMarkelov had scarcely spoken to Nejdanov on the journey, and all his\r\naccumulated wrath burst forth now. Ostrodumov and Mashurina expressed\r\ntheir approval every now and again by a look, a smile, a short\r\nexclamation, but a strange feeling came over Nejdanov. He tried to make\r\nsome sort of objection at first, pointing out the danger of hasty action\r\nand mentioned certain former premature attempts. He marvelled at the\r\nway in which everything was settled beyond a shadow of a doubt, without\r\ntaking into consideration the special circumstances, or even trying to\r\nfind out what the masses really wanted. At last his nerves became so\r\nhighly strung that they trembled like the strings of an instrument, and\r\nwith a sort of despair, almost with tears in his eyes, he began speaking\r\nat the top of his voice, in the same strain as Markelov, going even\r\nfarther than he had done. What inspired him would be difficult to say;\r\nwas it remorse for having been inactive of late, annoyance with himself\r\nand with others, a desire to drown the gnawings of an inner pain, or\r\nmerely to show off before his comrades, whom he had not seen for some\r\ntime, or had Markelov’s words really had some effect upon him, fired his\r\nblood? They talked until daybreak; Ostrodumov and Mashurina did not once\r\nrise from their seats, while Markelov and Nejdanov remained on their\r\nfeet all the time. Markelov stood on the same spot for all the world\r\nlike a sentinel, and Nejdanov walked up and down the room with nervous\r\nstrides, now slowly, now hurriedly. They spoke of the necessary means\r\nand measures to be employed, of the part each must take upon himself,\r\nselected and tied up various bundles of pamphlets and leaflets,\r\nmentioned a certain merchant, Golushkin, a nonconformist, as a very\r\npossible man, although uneducated, then a young propagandist,\r\nKisliakov, who was very clever, but had an exaggerated idea of his own\r\ncapabilities, and also spoke of Solomin....\r\n\r\n“Is that the man who manages a cotton factory?” Nejdanov asked,\r\nrecalling what Sipiagin had said of him at table.\r\n\r\n“Yes, that is the man,” Markelov replied. “You should get to know him.\r\nWe have not sounded him as yet, but I believe he is an extremely capable\r\nman.”\r\n\r\nEremy of Goloplok was mentioned again, together with Sipiagin’s servant,\r\nKirill, and a certain Mendely, known under the name of “Sulks.” The\r\nlatter it seemed was not to be relied upon. He was very bold when sober,\r\nbut a coward when drunk, and was nearly always drunk.\r\n\r\n“And what about your own people?” Nejdanov asked of Markelov. “Are there\r\nany reliable men among them?”\r\n\r\nMarkelov thought there were, but did not mention anyone by name,\r\nhowever. He went on to talk of the town tradespeople, of the\r\npublic-school boys, who they thought might come in useful if matters\r\nwere to come to fisticuffs. Nejdanov also inquired about the gentry of\r\nthe neighbourhood, and learned from Markelov that there were five or six\r\npossible young men—among them, but, unfortunately, the most radical of\r\nthem was a German, “and you can’t trust a German, you know, he is sure\r\nto deceive you sooner or later!” They must wait and see what information\r\nKisliakov would gather. Nejdanov also asked about the military, but\r\nMarkelov hesitated, tugged at his long whiskers, and announced at\r\nlast that with regard to them nothing certain was known as yet, unless\r\nKisliakov had made any discoveries.\r\n\r\n“Who is this Kisliakov?” Nejdanov asked impatiently.\r\n\r\nMarkelov smiled significantly.\r\n\r\n“He’s a wonderful person,” he declared. “I know very little of him,\r\nhave only met him twice, but you should see what letters he writes!\r\nMarvellous letters! I will show them to you and you can judge for\r\nyourself. He is full of enthusiasm. And what activity the man is capable\r\nof! He has rushed over the length and breadth of Russia five or six\r\ntimes, and written a twelve-page letter from every place!”\r\n\r\nNejdanov looked questioningly at Ostrodumov, but the latter was sitting\r\nlike a statue, not an eyebrow twitching. Mashurina was also motionless,\r\na bitter smile playing on her lips.\r\n\r\nNejdanov went on to ask Markelov if he had made any socialist\r\nexperiments on his own estate, but here Ostrodumov interrupted him.\r\n\r\n“What is the good of all that?” he asked. “All the same, it will have to\r\nbe altered afterwards.”\r\n\r\nThe conversation turned to political channels again. The mysterious\r\ninner pain again began gnawing at Nejdanov’s heart, but the keener the\r\npain, the more positively and loudly he spoke. He had drunk only\r\none glass of beer, but it seemed to him at times that he was quite\r\nintoxicated. His head swam around and his heart beat feverishly.\r\n\r\nWhen the discussion came to an end at last at about four o’clock in the\r\nmorning, and they all passed by the servant asleep in the anteroom on\r\ntheir way to their own rooms, Nejdanov, before retiring to bed, stood\r\nfor a long time motionless, gazing straight before him. He was filled\r\nwith wonder at the proud, heart-rending note in all that Markelov had\r\nsaid. The man’s vanity must have been hurt, he must have suffered, but\r\nhow nobly he forgot his own personal sorrows for that which he held to\r\nbe the truth. “He is a limited soul,” Nejdanov thought, “but is it not a\r\nthousand times better to be like that than such... such as I feel myself\r\nto be?”\r\n\r\nHe immediately became indignant at his own self-depreciation.\r\n\r\n“What made me think that? Am I not also capable of self-sacrifice? Just\r\nwait, gentlemen, and you too, Paklin. I will show you all that although\r\nI am aesthetic and write verses—”\r\n\r\nHe pushed back his hair with an angry gesture, ground his teeth,\r\nundressed hurriedly, and jumped into the cold, damp bed.\r\n\r\n“Goodnight, I am your neighbour,” Mashurina’s voice was heard from the\r\nother side of the door.\r\n\r\n“Goodnight,” Nejdanov responded, and remembered suddenly that during the\r\nwhole evening she had not taken her eyes off him.\r\n\r\n“What does she want?” he muttered to himself, and instantly felt\r\nashamed. “If only I could get to sleep!”\r\n\r\nBut it was difficult for him to calm his overwrought nerves, and the sun\r\nwas already high when at last he fell into a heavy, troubled sleep.\r\n\r\nIn the morning he got up late with a bad headache. He dressed, went up\r\nto the window of his attic, and looked out upon Markelov’s farm. It\r\nwas practically a mere nothing; the tiny little house was situated in a\r\nhollow by the side of a wood. A small barn, the stables, cellar, and\r\na little hut with a half-bare thatched roof, stood on one side; on the\r\nother a small pond, a strip of kitchen garden, a hemp field, another hut\r\nwith a roof like the first one; in the distance yet another barn, a tiny\r\nshed, and an empty threshing floor—this was all the “wealth” that met\r\nthe eye. It all seemed poor and decaying, not exactly as if it had been\r\nallowed to run wild, but as though it had never flourished, like a young\r\ntree that had not taken root well.\r\n\r\nWhen Nejdanov went downstairs, Mashurina was sitting in the dining room\r\nat the samovar, evidently waiting for him. She told him that Ostrodumov\r\nhad gone away on business, in connection with the cause, and would not\r\nbe back for about a fortnight, and that their host had gone to look\r\nafter his peasants. As it was already at the end of May, and there was\r\nno urgent work to be done, Markelov had thought of felling a small birch\r\nwood, with such means as he had at his command, and had gone down there\r\nto see after it.\r\n\r\nNejdanov felt a strange weariness at heart. So much had been said the\r\nnight before about the impossibility of holding back any longer, about\r\nthe necessity of making a beginning. “But how could one begin, now, at\r\nonce?” he asked himself. It was useless talking it over with Mashurina,\r\nthere was no hesitation for her. She knew that she had to go to K., and\r\nbeyond that she did not look ahead. Nejdanov was at a loss to know what\r\nto say to her, and as soon as he finished his tea took his hat and went\r\nout in the direction of the birch wood. On the way he fell in with some\r\npeasants carting manure, a few of Markelov’s former serfs. He entered\r\ninto conversation with them, but was very little the wiser for it. They,\r\ntoo, seemed weary, but with a normal physical weariness, quite unlike\r\nthe sensation experienced by him. They spoke of their master as a\r\nkind-hearted gentleman, but rather odd, and predicted his ruin, because\r\nhe would go his own way, instead of doing as his forefathers had done\r\nbefore him. “And he’s so clever, you know, you can’t understand what he\r\nsays, however hard you may try. But he’s a good sort.” A little farther\r\non Nejdanov came across Markelov himself.\r\n\r\nHe was surrounded by a whole crowd of labourers, and one could see from\r\nthe distance that he was trying to explain something to them as hard as\r\nhe could, but suddenly threw up his arms in despair, as if it were of\r\nno use. His bailiff, a small, short-sighted young man without a trace of\r\nauthority or firmness in his bearing, was walking beside him, and merely\r\nkept on repeating, “Just so, sir,” to Markelov’s great disgust, who had\r\nexpected more independence from him. Nejdanov went up to Markelov, and\r\non looking into his face was struck by the same expression of spiritual\r\nweariness he was himself suffering from. Soon after greeting one\r\nanother, Markelov began talking again of last night’s “problems” (more\r\nbriefly this time), about the impending revolution, the weary expression\r\nnever once leaving his face. He was smothered in perspiration and dust,\r\nhis voice was hoarse, and his clothes were covered all over with bits of\r\nwood shavings and pieces of green moss. The labourers stood by\r\nsilently, half afraid and half amused. Nejdanov glanced at Markelov, and\r\nOstrodumov’s remark, “What is the good of it all? All the same, it will\r\nhave to be altered afterwards,” flashed across his mind. One of the men,\r\nwho had been fined for some offence, began begging Markelov to let him\r\noff. The latter got angry, shouted furiously, but forgave him in the\r\nend. “All the same, it will have to be altered afterwards.”\r\n\r\nNejdanov asked him for horses and a conveyance to take him home.\r\nMarkelov seemed surprised at the request, but promised to have\r\neverything ready in good time. They turned back to the house together,\r\nMarkelov staggering as he walked.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter with you?” Nejdanov asked.\r\n\r\n“I am simply worn out!” Markelov began furiously. “No matter what you\r\ndo, you simply can’t make these people understand anything! They are\r\nutterly incapable of carrying out an order, and do not even understand\r\nplain Russian. If you talk of ‘part’, they know what that means\r\nwell enough, but the word ‘participation’ is utterly beyond their\r\ncomprehension, just as if it did not belong to the Russian language.\r\nThey’ve taken it into their heads that I want to give them a part of the\r\nland!”\r\n\r\nMarkelov had tried to explain to the peasants the principles of\r\ncooperation with a view to introducing it on his estate, but they were\r\ncompletely opposed to it. “The pit was deep enough before, but now\r\nthere’s no seeing the bottom of it,” one of them remarked, and all the\r\nothers gave forth a sympathetic sigh, quite crushing poor Markelov. He\r\ndismissed the men and went into the house to see about a conveyance and\r\nlunch.\r\n\r\nThe whole of Markelov’s household consisted of a man servant, a cook,\r\na coachman, and a very old man with hairy ears, in a long-skirted linen\r\ncoat, who had once been his grandfather’s valet. This old man was for\r\never gazing at Markelov with a most woe-begone expression on his face.\r\nHe was too old to do anything, but was always present, huddled together\r\nby the door.\r\n\r\nAfter a lunch of hard-boiled eggs, anchovies, and cold hash (the\r\nman handing them pepper in an old pomade pot and vinegar in an old\r\neau-de-cologne bottle), Nejdanov took his seat in the same carriage in\r\nwhich he had come the night before. This time it was harnessed to two\r\nhorses, not three, as the third had been newly shod, and was a little\r\nlame.\r\n\r\nMarkelov had spoken very little during the meal, had eaten nothing\r\nwhatever, and breathed with difficulty. He let fall a few bitter remarks\r\nabout his farm and threw up his arms in despair. “All the same, it will\r\nhave to be altered afterwards!”\r\n\r\nMashurina asked Nejdanov if she might come with him as far as the town,\r\nwhere she had a little shopping to do. “I can walk back afterwards or,\r\nif need be, ask the first peasant I meet for a lift in his cart.”\r\n\r\nMarkelov accompanied them to the door, saying that he would soon send\r\nfor Nejdanov again, and then ... then (he trembled suddenly, but pulled\r\nhimself together) they would have to settle things definitely. Solomin\r\nmust also come. He (Markelov) was only waiting to hear from Vassily\r\nNikolaevitch, and that as soon as he heard from him there would be\r\nnothing to hinder them from making a “beginning,” as the masses (the\r\nsame masses who failed to understand the word “participation”) refused\r\nto wait any longer!\r\n\r\n“Oh, by the way, what about those letters you wanted to show me? What is\r\nthe fellow’s name... Kisliakov?” Nejdanov asked.\r\n\r\n“Later on... I will show them to you later on. We can do it all at the\r\nsame time.”\r\n\r\nThe carriage moved.\r\n\r\n“Hold yourself in readiness!” Markelov’s voice was heard again, as he\r\nstood on the doorstep. And by his side, with the same hopeless dejection\r\nin his face, straightening his bent back, his hands clasped behind him,\r\ndiffusing an odour of rye bread and mustiness, not hearing a single\r\nword that was being said around him, stood the model servant, his\r\ngrandfather’s decrepit old valet.\r\n\r\nMashurina sat smoking silently all the way, but when they reached the\r\ntown gates she gave a loud sigh.\r\n\r\n“I feel so sorry for Sergai Mihailovitch,” she remarked, her face\r\ndarkening.\r\n\r\n“He is over-worked, and it seems to me his affairs are in a bad way,”\r\n Nejdanov said.\r\n\r\n“I was not thinking of that.”\r\n\r\n“What were you thinking of then?”\r\n\r\n“He is so unhappy and so unfortunate. It would be difficult to find a\r\nbetter man than he is, but he never seems to get on.”\r\n\r\nNejdanov looked at her.\r\n\r\n“Do you know anything about him?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing whatever, but you can see for yourself. Goodbye, Alexai\r\nDmitritch.” Mashurina clambered out of the carriage.\r\n\r\nAn hour later Nejdanov was rolling up the courtyard leading to\r\nSipiagin’s house. He did not feel well after his sleepless night and the\r\nnumerous discussions and explanations.\r\n\r\nA beautiful face smiled to him out of the window. It was Madame\r\nSipiagina welcoming him back home.\r\n\r\n“What glorious eyes she has!” he thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nA great many people came to dinner. When it was over, Nejdanov took\r\nadvantage of the general bustle and slipped away to his own room. He\r\nwanted to be alone with his own thoughts, to arrange the impressions\r\nhe had carried away from his recent journey. Valentina Mihailovna had\r\nlooked at him intently several times during dinner, but there had been\r\nno opportunity of speaking to him. Mariana, after the unexpected freak\r\nwhich had so bewildered him, was evidently repenting of it, and seemed\r\nto avoid him. Nejdanov took up a pen to write to his friend Silin,\r\nbut he did not know what to say to him. There were so many conflicting\r\nthoughts and sensations crowding in upon him that he did not attempt to\r\ndisentangle them, and put them off for another day.\r\n\r\nKollomietzev had made one of the guests at dinner. Never before had this\r\nworthy shown so much insolence and snobbish contemptuousness as on this\r\noccasion, but Nejdanov simply ignored him.\r\n\r\nHe was surrounded by a sort of mist, which seemed to hang before him\r\nlike a filmy curtain, separating him from the rest of the world.\r\nAnd through this film, strange to say, he perceived only three\r\nfaces—women’s faces—and all three were gazing at him intently. They\r\nwere Madame Sipiagina, Mashurina, and Mariana. What did it mean? Why\r\nparticularly these three? What had they in common, and what did they\r\nwant of him?\r\n\r\nHe went to bed early, but could not fall asleep. He was haunted by sad\r\nand gloomy reflections about the inevitable end—death. These thoughts\r\nwere familiar to him, many times had he turned them over this way\r\nand that, first shuddering at the probability of annihilation, then\r\nwelcoming it, almost rejoicing in it. Suddenly a peculiarly familiar\r\nagitation took possession of him.... He mused awhile, sat down at the\r\ntable, and wrote down the following lines in his sacred copy-book,\r\nwithout a single correction:\r\n\r\nWhen I die, dear friend, remember This desire I tell to thee: Burn thou\r\nto the last black ember All my heart has writ for me. Let the fairest\r\nflowers surround me, Sunlight laugh about my bed, Let the sweetest\r\nof musicians To the door of death be led. Bid them sound no strain\r\nof sadness—Muted string or muffled drum; Come to me with songs of\r\ngladness—Whirling in the wild waltz come! I would hear—ere yet I hear\r\nnot—Trembling strings their cadence keep, Chords that quiver: so I also\r\nTremble as I fall asleep. Memories of life and laughter, Memories of\r\nearthly glee, As I go to the hereafter All my lullaby shall be.\r\n\r\nWhen he wrote the word “friend” he thought of Silin. He read the verses\r\nover to himself in an undertone, and was surprised at what had come from\r\nhis pen. This scepticism, this indifference, this almost frivolous lack\r\nof faith—how did it all agree with his principles? How did it agree\r\nwith what he had said at Markelov’s? He thrust the copybook into the\r\ntable drawer and went back to bed. But he did not fall asleep until\r\ndawn, when the larks had already begun to twitter and the sky was\r\nturning paler.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, soon after he had finished his lesson and was\r\nsitting in the billiard room, Madame Sipiagina entered, looked round\r\ncautiously, and coming up to him with a smile, invited him to come into\r\nher boudoir. She had on a white barège dress, very simple, but extremely\r\npretty. The embroidered frills of her sleeves came down as far as the\r\nelbow, a broad ribbon encircled her waist, her hair fell in thick curls\r\nabout her neck. Everything about her was inviting and caressing, with\r\na sort of restrained, yet encouraging, caressiveness, everything; the\r\nsubdued lustre of her half-closed eyes, the soft indolence of her voice,\r\nher gestures, her very walk. She conducted Nejdanov into her boudoir, a\r\ncosy, charming room, filled with the scent of flowers and perfumes, the\r\npure freshness of feminine garments, the constant presence of a woman.\r\nShe made him sit down in an armchair, sat down beside him, and began\r\nquestioning him about his visit, about Markelov’s way of living, with\r\nmuch tact and sweetness. She showed a genuine interest in her brother,\r\nalthough she had not once mentioned him in Nejdanov’s presence. One\r\ncould gather from what she said that the impression Mariana had made\r\non her brother had not escaped her notice. She seemed a little\r\ndisappointed, but whether it was due to the fact that Mariana did not\r\nreciprocate his feelings, or that his choice should have fallen upon\r\na girl so utterly unlike him, was not quite clear. But most of all she\r\nevidently strove to soften Nejdanov, to arouse his confidence towards\r\nher, to break down his shyness; she even went so far as to reproach him\r\na little for having a false idea of her.\r\n\r\nNejdanov listened to her, gazed at her arms, her shoulders, and from\r\ntime to time cast a look at her rosy lips and her unruly, massive curls.\r\nHis replies were brief at first; he felt a curious pressure in his\r\nthroat and chest, but by degrees this sensation gave way to another,\r\njust as disturbing, but not devoid of a certain sweetness.... He was\r\nsurprised that such a beautiful aristocratic lady of important position\r\nshould take the trouble to interest herself in him, a simple student,\r\nand not only interest herself, but flirt with him a little besides. He\r\nwondered, but could not make out her object in doing so. To tell the\r\ntruth, he was little concerned about the object. Madame Sipiagina went\r\non to speak of Kolia, and assured Nejdanov that she wished to become\r\nbetter acquainted with him only so that she might talk to him seriously\r\nabout her son, get to know his views on the education of Russian\r\nchildren. It might have seemed a little curious that such a wish should\r\nhave come upon her so suddenly, but the root of the matter did not lie\r\nin what Valentina Mihailovna had said. She had been seized by a wave of\r\nsensuousness, a desire to conquer and bring to her feet this rebellious\r\nyoung man.\r\n\r\nHere it is necessary to go back a little. Valentina Mihailovna was\r\nthe daughter of a general who had been neither over-wise nor\r\nover-industrious in his life. He had received only one star and a\r\nbuckle as a reward for fifty years’ service. She was a Little Russian,\r\nintriguing and sly, endowed, like many of her countrywomen, with a very\r\nsimple and even stupid exterior, from which she knew how to extract the\r\nmaximum of advantage. Valentina Mihailovna’s parents were not rich, but\r\nthey had managed to educate her at the Smolny Convent, where, although\r\nconsidered a republican, she was always in the foreground and very well\r\ntreated on account of her excellent behaviour and industriousness. On\r\nleaving the convent she settled with her mother (her brother had gone\r\ninto the country, and her father, the general with the star and buckle,\r\nhad died) in a very clean, but extremely chilly, apartment, in which you\r\ncould see your own breath as you talked. Valentina Mihailovna used to\r\nmake fun of it and declare it was like being in church. She was very\r\nbrave in bearing with all the discomforts of a poor, pinched existence,\r\nhaving a wonderfully sweet temper. With her mother’s help, she managed\r\nboth to keep up and make new connections and acquaintances, and was even\r\nspoken of in the highest circles as a very nice well-bred girl. She had\r\nseveral suitors, had fixed upon Sipiagin from them all, and had very\r\nquickly and ingeniously made him fall in love with her. However, he\r\nwas soon convinced that he could not have made a better choice. She\r\nwas intelligent, rather good than ill-natured, at bottom cold and\r\nindifferent, but unable to endure the idea that anyone should be\r\nindifferent to her.\r\n\r\nValentina Mihailovna was possessed of that peculiar charm, the\r\ncharacteristic of all “charming” egoists, in which there is neither\r\npoetry nor real sensitiveness, but which is often full of superficial\r\ngentleness, sympathy, sometimes even tenderness. But these charming\r\negoists must not be thwarted. They are very domineering and cannot\r\nendure independence in others. Women like Madame Sipiagina excite and\r\ndisturb people of inexperienced and passionate natures, but are fond of\r\na quiet and peaceful life themselves. Virtue comes easy to them, they\r\nare placid of temperament, but a constant desire to command, to attract,\r\nand to please gives them mobility and brilliance. They have an iron\r\nwill, and a good deal of their fascination is due to this will. It is\r\ndifficult for a man to hold his ground when the mysterious sparks\r\nof tenderness begin to kindle, as if involuntarily, in one of these\r\nunstirred creatures; he waits for the hour to come when the ice will\r\nmelt, but the rays only play over the transparent surface, and never\r\ndoes he see it melt or its smoothness disturbed!\r\n\r\nIt cost Madame Sipiagina very little to flirt, knowing full well that it\r\ninvolved no danger for herself, but to take the lustre out of another’s\r\neyes and see them sparkle again, to see another’s cheeks become flushed\r\nwith desire and dread, to hear another’s voice tremble and break\r\ndown, to disturb another’s soul—oh, how sweet it was to her soul! How\r\ndelightful it was late at night, when she lay down in her snow-white bed\r\nto an untroubled sleep, to remember all these agitated words and looks\r\nand sighs. With what a self-satisfied smile she retired into herself,\r\ninto the consciousness of her inaccessibility, her invulnerability, and\r\nwith what condescension she abandoned herself to the lawful embrace of\r\nher well-bred husband! It was so pleasant that for a little time she\r\nwas filled with emotion, ready to do some kind deed, to help a fellow\r\ncreature.... Once, after a secretary of legation, who was madly in\r\nlove with her, had attempted to cut his throat, she founded a small\r\nalms-house! She had prayed for him fervently, although her religious\r\nfeelings from earliest childhood had not been strongly developed.\r\n\r\nAnd so she talked to Nejdanov, doing everything she could to bring him\r\nto her feet. She allowed him to come near her, she revealed herself\r\nto him, as it were, and with a sweet curiosity, with a half-maternal\r\ntenderness, she watched this handsome, interesting, stern radical\r\nsoftening towards her quietly and awkwardly. A day, an hour, a minute\r\nlater and all this would have vanished without leaving a trace, but for\r\nthe time being it was pleasant, amusing, rather pathetic, and even a\r\nlittle sad. Forgetting his origin, and knowing that such interest is\r\nalways appreciated by lonely people happening to fall among strangers,\r\nshe began questioning him about his youth, about his family.... But\r\nguessing from his curt replies that she had made a mistake, Valentina\r\nMihailovna tried to smooth things over and began to unfold herself still\r\nmore before him, as a rose unfolds its fragrant petals on a hot summer’s\r\nnoon, closing them again tightly at the first approach of the evening\r\ncoolness.\r\n\r\nShe could not fully smooth over her blunder, however. Having been\r\ntouched on a sensitive spot, Nejdanov could not regain his former\r\nconfidence. That bitterness which he always carried, always felt at\r\nthe bottom of his heart, stirred again, awakening all his democratic\r\nsuspicions and reproaches. “That is not what I’ve come here for,” he\r\nthought, recalling Paklin’s admonition. He took advantage of a pause in\r\nthe conversation, got up, bowed slightly, and went out “very foolishly”\r\n as he could not help saying to himself afterwards.\r\n\r\nHis confusion did not escape Valentina Mihailovna’s notice, and judging\r\nby the smile with which she accompanied him, she had put it down to her\r\nown advantage.\r\n\r\nIn the billiard room Nejdanov came across Mariana. She was standing\r\nwith her back to the window, not far from the door of Madame Sipiagina’s\r\nboudoir, with her arms tightly folded. Her face was almost in complete\r\nshadow, but she fixed her fearless eyes on Nejdanov so penetratingly,\r\nand her tightly closed lips expressed so much contempt and insulting\r\npity, that he stood still in amazement....\r\n\r\n“Have you anything to say to me?” he asked involuntarily.\r\n\r\nMariana did not reply for a time.\r\n\r\n“No... yes I have, though not now.”\r\n\r\n“When?”\r\n\r\n“You must wait awhile. Perhaps—tomorrow, perhaps—never. I know so\r\nlittle—what are you really like?”\r\n\r\n“But,” Nejdanov began, “I sometimes feel... that between us—”\r\n\r\n“But you hardly know me at all,” Mariana interrupted him. “Well, wait a\r\nlittle. Tomorrow, perhaps. Now I have to go to... my mistress. Goodbye,\r\ntill tomorrow.”\r\n\r\nNejdanov took a step or two in advance, but turned back suddenly.\r\n\r\n“By the way, Mariana Vikentievna... may I come to school with you one\r\nday before it closes? I should like to see what you do there.”\r\n\r\n“With pleasure.... But it was not the school about which I wished to\r\nspeak to you.”\r\n\r\n“What was it then?”\r\n\r\n“Tomorrow,” Mariana repeated.\r\n\r\nBut she did not wait until the next day, and the conversation between\r\nher and Nejdanov took place on that same evening in one of the linden\r\navenues not far from the terrace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nShe came up to him first.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Nejdanov,” she began, “it seems that you are quite enchanted with\r\nValentina Mihailovna.”\r\n\r\nShe turned down the avenue without waiting for a reply; he walked by her\r\nside.\r\n\r\n“What makes you think so?”\r\n\r\n“Is it not a fact? In that case she behaved very foolishly today. I can\r\nimagine how concerned she must have been, and how she tried to cast her\r\nwary nets!”\r\n\r\nNejdanov did not utter a word, but looked at his companion sideways.\r\n\r\n“Listen,” she continued, “it’s no use pretending; I don’t like Valentina\r\nMihailovna, and you know that well enough. I may seem unjust... but I\r\nwant you to hear me first—”\r\n\r\nMariana’s voice gave way. She suddenly flushed with emotion; under\r\nemotion she always gave one the impression of being angry.\r\n\r\n“You are no doubt asking yourself, ‘Why does this tiresome young lady\r\ntell me all this?’ just as you must have done when I spoke to you...\r\nabout Mr. Markelov.”\r\n\r\nShe bent down, tore off a small mushroom, broke it to pieces, and threw\r\nit away.\r\n\r\n“You are quite mistaken, Mariana Vikentievna,” Nejdanov remarked. “On\r\nthe contrary, I am pleased to think that I inspire you with confidence.”\r\n\r\nThis was not true, the idea had only just occurred to him.\r\n\r\nMariana glanced at him for a moment. Until then she had persistently\r\nlooked away from him.\r\n\r\n“It is not that you inspire me with confidence exactly,” she went on\r\npensively; “you are quite a stranger to me. But your position—and\r\nmine—are very similar. We are both alike—unhappy; that is a bond\r\nbetween us.”\r\n\r\n“Are you unhappy?” Nejdanov asked.\r\n\r\n“And you, are you not?” Mariana asked in her turn. Nejdanov did not say\r\nanything.\r\n\r\n“Do you know my story?” she asked quickly. “The story of my father’s\r\nexile? Don’t you? Well, here it is: He was arrested, tried, convicted,\r\ndeprived of his rank ... and everything ... and sent to Siberia, where\r\nhe died.... My mother died too. My uncle, Mr. Sipiagin, my mother’s\r\nbrother, brought me up.... I am dependent upon him—he is my benefactor\r\nand—Valentina Mihailovna is my benefactress.... I pay them back with\r\nbase ingratitude because I have an unfeeling heart.... But the bread of\r\ncharity is bitter—and I can’t bear insulting condescensions—and can’t\r\nendure to be patronised. I can’t hide things, and when I’m constantly\r\nbeing hurt I only keep from crying out because I’m too proud to do so.”\r\n\r\nAs she uttered these disjointed sentences, Mariana walked faster and\r\nfaster. Suddenly she stopped. “Do you know that my aunt, in order to get\r\nrid of me, wants to marry me to that hateful Kollomietzev? She knows my\r\nideas... in her eyes I’m almost a nihilist—and he! It’s true he doesn’t\r\ncare for me... I’m not good-looking enough, but it’s possible to sell\r\nme. That would also be considered charity.”\r\n\r\n“Why didn’t you—” Nejdanov began, but stopped short.\r\n\r\nMariana looked at him for an instant.\r\n\r\n“You wanted to ask why I didn’t accept Mr. Markelov, isn’t that so?\r\nWell, what could I do? He’s a good man, but it’s not my fault that I\r\ndon’t love him.”\r\n\r\nMariana walked on ahead, as if she wished to save her companion the\r\nnecessity of saying anything to this unexpected confession.\r\n\r\nThey both reached the end of the avenue. Mariana turned quickly down a\r\nnarrow path leading into a dense fir grove; Nejdanov followed her. He\r\nwas under the influence of a twofold astonishment; first, it puzzled him\r\nthat this shy girl should suddenly become so open and frank with him,\r\nand secondly, that he was not in the least surprised at this frankness,\r\nthat he looked upon it, in fact, as quite natural.\r\n\r\nMariana turned round suddenly, stopped in the middle of the path with\r\nher face about a yard from Nejdanov’s, and looked straight into his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n“Alexai Dmitritch,” she said, “please don’t think my aunt is a bad\r\nwoman. She is not. She is deceitful all over, she’s an actress, a\r\nposer—she wants everyone to bow down before her as a beauty and worship\r\nher as a saint! She will invent a pretty speech, say it to one person,\r\nrepeat it to a second, a third, with an air as if it had only just come\r\nto her by inspiration, emphasising it by the use of her wonderful eyes!\r\nShe understands herself very well—she is fully conscious of looking\r\nlike a Madonna, and knows that she does not love a living soul! She\r\npretends to be forever worrying over Kolia, when in reality does nothing\r\nbut talk about him with clever people. She does not wish harm to any\r\none... is all kindness, but let every bone in your body be broken before\r\nher very eyes... and she wouldn’t care a straw! She would not move\r\na finger to save you, and if by any chance it should happen to be\r\nnecessary or useful to her...then heaven have mercy on you....”\r\n\r\nMariana ceased. Her wrath was choking her. She could not contain\r\nherself, and had resolved on giving full vent to it, but words failed\r\nher. Mariana belonged to a particular class of unfortunate beings, very\r\nplentiful in Russia, whom justice satisfies, but does not rejoice, while\r\ninjustice, against which they are very sensitive, revolts them to their\r\ninnermost being. All the time she was speaking, Nejdanov watched her\r\nintently. Her flushed face, her short, untidy hair, the tremulous\r\ntwitching of her thin lips, struck him as menacing, significant, and\r\nbeautiful. A ray of sunlight, broken by a net of branches, lay across\r\nher forehead like a patch of gold. And this tongue of fire seemed to\r\nbe in keeping with the keen expression of her face, her fixed wide-open\r\neyes, the earnest sound of her voice.\r\n\r\n“Tell me why you think me unhappy,” Nejdanov observed at last. “Do you\r\nknow anything about me?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“What do you know? Has anyone been talking to you about me?”\r\n\r\n“I know about your birth.”\r\n\r\n“Who told you?”\r\n\r\n“Why, Valentina Mihailovna, of course, whom you admire so much.\r\nShe mentioned in my presence, just in passing you know, but quite\r\nintentionally, that there was a very interesting incident in your life.\r\nShe was not condoling the fact, but merely mentioned it as a person of\r\nadvanced views who is above prejudice. You need not be surprised; in the\r\nsame way she tells every visitor that comes that my father was sent\r\nto Siberia for taking bribes. However much she may think herself an\r\naristocrat, she is nothing more than a mere scandal-monger and a poser.\r\nThat is your Sistine Madonna!”\r\n\r\n“Why is she mine in particular?”\r\n\r\nMariana turned away and resumed her walk down the path.\r\n\r\n“Because you had such a long conversation together,” she said, a lump\r\nrising in her throat.\r\n\r\n“I scarcely said a word the whole time,” Nejdanov observed. “It was she\r\nwho did the talking.”\r\n\r\nMariana walked on in silence. A turn in the path brought them to the end\r\nof the grove in front of which lay a small lawn; a weeping silver birch\r\nstood in the middle, its hollow trunk encircled by a round seat. Mariana\r\nsat down on this seat and Nejdanov seated himself at her side. The long\r\nhanging branches covered with tiny green leaves were waving gently over\r\ntheir heads. Around them masses of lily-of-the-valley could be seen\r\npeeping out from amidst the fine grass. The whole place was filled with\r\na sweet scent, refreshing after the very heavy resinous smell of the\r\npine trees.\r\n\r\n“So you want to see the school,” Mariana began; “I must warn you that\r\nyou will not find it very exciting. You have heard that our principal\r\nmaster is the deacon. He is not a bad fellow, but you can’t imagine what\r\nnonsense he talks to the children. There is a certain boy among them,\r\ncalled Garacy, an orphan of nine years old, and, would you believe it,\r\nhe learns better than any of the others!”\r\n\r\nWith the change of conversation, Mariana herself seemed to change. She\r\nturned paler, became more composed, and her face assumed an expression\r\nof embarrassment, as if she were repenting of her outburst. She\r\nevidently wished to lead Nejdanov into discussing some “question” or\r\nother about the school, the peasants, anything, so as not to continue in\r\nthe former strain. But he was far from “questions” at this moment.\r\n\r\n“Mariana Vikentievna,” he began; “to be quite frank with you, I little\r\nexpected all that has happened between us.” (At the word “happened” she\r\ndrew herself up.) “It seems to me that we have suddenly become very...\r\nvery intimate. That is as it should be. We have for some time past been\r\ngetting closer to one another, only we have not expressed it in words.\r\nAnd so I will also speak to you frankly. It is no doubt wretched for you\r\nhere, but surely your uncle, although he is limited, seems a kind man,\r\nas far as one can judge. Doesn’t he understand your position and take\r\nyour part?”\r\n\r\n“My uncle, in the first place, is not a man, he’s an official, a\r\nsenator, or a minister, I forget which; and in the second, I don’t want\r\nto complain and speak badly of people for nothing. It is not at all\r\nhard for me here, that is, nobody interferes with me; my aunt’s petty\r\npin-pricks are in reality nothing to me.... I am quite free.”\r\n\r\nNejdanov looked at her in amazement.\r\n\r\n“In that case... everything that you have just told me—”\r\n\r\n“You may laugh at me if you like,” she said. “If I am unhappy—it is\r\nnot as a result of my own sorrows. It sometimes seems to me that I\r\nsuffer for the miserable, poor and oppressed in the whole of Russia....\r\nNo, it’s not exactly that. I suffer—I am indignant for them, I rebel\r\nfor them.... I am ready to go to the stake for them. I am unhappy\r\nbecause I am a ‘young lady,’ a parasite, that I am completely unable\r\nto do anything ... anything! When my father was sent to Siberia and I\r\nremained with my mother in Moscow, how I longed to go to him! It was\r\nnot that I loved or respected him very much, but I wanted to know,\r\nto see with my own eyes, how the exiled and banished live.... How\r\nI loathed myself and all these placid, rich, well-fed people! And\r\nafterwards, when he returned home, broken in body and soul, and began\r\nhumbly busying himself, trying to work ... oh ... how terrible it\r\nwas! It was a good thing that he died... and my poor mother too. But,\r\nunfortunately, I was left behind.... What for? Only to feel that I have\r\na bad nature, that I am ungrateful, that there is no peace for me, that\r\nI can do nothing—nothing for anything or anybody!”\r\n\r\nMariana turned away—her hand slid on to the seat. Nejdanov felt sorry\r\nfor her; he touched the drooping hand. Mariana pulled it away quickly;\r\nnot that Nejdanov’s action seemed unsuitable to her, but that he should\r\non no account think that she was asking for sympathy.\r\n\r\nThrough the branches of the pines a glimpse of a woman’s dress could be\r\nseen. Mariana drew herself up.\r\n\r\n“Look, your Madonna has sent her spy. That maid has to keep a watch on\r\nme and inform her mistress where I am and with whom. My aunt very likely\r\nguessed that I was with you, and thought it improper, especially after\r\nthe sentimental scene she acted before you this afternoon. Anyhow, it’s\r\ntime we were back. Let us go.”\r\n\r\nMariana got up. Nejdanov rose also. She glanced at him over her\r\nshoulder, and suddenly there passed over her face an almost childish\r\nexpression, making her embarrassment seem charming.\r\n\r\n“You are not angry with me, are you? You don’t think I have been trying\r\nto win your sympathy, do you? No, I’m sure you don’t,” she went on\r\nbefore Nejdanov had time to make any reply; “you are like me, just as\r\nunhappy, and your nature... is bad, like mine. We can go to the school\r\ntogether tomorrow. We are excellent friends now, aren’t we?”\r\n\r\nWhen Mariana and Nejdanov drew near to the house, Valentina Mihailovna\r\nlooked at them from the balcony through her lorgnette, shook her head\r\nslowly with a smile on her lips, then returning through the open\r\nglass door into the drawing-room, where Sipiagin was already seated at\r\npreferences with their toothless neighbour, who had dropped in to tea,\r\nshe drawled out, laying stress on each syllable: “How damp the air is!\r\nIt’s not good for one’s health!”\r\n\r\nMariana and Nejdanov exchanged glances; Sipiagin, who had just scored\r\na trick from his partner, cast a truly ministerial glance at his wife,\r\nlooking her over from top to toe, then transferred this same cold,\r\nsleepy, but penetrating glance to the young couple coming in from the\r\ndark garden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nTwo more weeks went by; everything in its accustomed order. Sipiagin\r\nfixed everyone’s daily occupation, if not like a minister, at any rate\r\nlike the director of a department, and was, as usual, haughty, humane,\r\nand somewhat fastidious. Kolia continued taking lessons; Anna Zaharovna,\r\nstill full of spite, worried about him constantly; visitors came\r\nand went, talked, played at cards, and did not seem bored. Valentina\r\nMihailovna continued amusing herself with Nejdanov, although her\r\ncustomary affability had become mixed with a certain amount of\r\ngood-natured sarcasm. Nejdanov had become very intimate with Mariana,\r\nand discovered that her temper was even enough and that one could\r\ndiscuss most things with her without hitting against any violent\r\nopposition. He had been to the school with her once or twice, but with\r\nthe first visit had become convinced that he could do nothing there.\r\nIt was under the entire control of the deacon, with Sipiagin’s full\r\nconsent. The good father did not teach grammar badly, although his\r\nmethod was rather old-fashioned, but at examinations he would put the\r\nmost absurd questions. For instance, he once asked Garacy how he would\r\nexplain the expression, “The waters are dark under the firmament,” to\r\nwhich Garacy had to answer, by the deacon’s own order, “It cannot be\r\nexplained.” However, the school was soon closed for the summer, not to\r\nbe opened again until the autumn.\r\n\r\nBearing in mind the suggestion of Paklin and others, Nejdanov did all\r\nhe could to come in contact with the peasants, but soon found that he\r\nwas only learning to understand them, in so far as he could make any\r\nobservation and doing no propaganda whatever! Nejdanov had lived in a\r\ntown all his life and, consequently, between him and the country people\r\nthere existed a gulf that could not be crossed. He once happened to\r\nexchange a few words with the drunken Kirill, and even with Mendely the\r\nSulky, but besides abuse about things in general he got nothing out\r\nof them. Another peasant, called Fituvy, completely nonplussed him.\r\nThis peasant had an unusually energetic countenance, almost like some\r\nbrigand. “Well, this one seems hopeful at any rate,” Nejdanov thought.\r\nBut it turned out that Fituvy was a miserable wretch, from whom the\r\nmir had taken away his land, because he, a strong healthy man, _would\r\nnot_ work. “I can’t,” he sobbed out, with deep inward groans, “I can’t\r\nwork! Kill me or I’ll lay hands on myself!” And he ended by begging\r\nalms in the streets! With a face out of a canvas of Rinaldo Rinaldini!\r\nAs for the factory men, Nejdanov could not get hold of them at all;\r\nthese fellows were either too sharp or too gloomy. He wrote a long\r\nletter to his friend Silin about the whole thing, in which he bitterly\r\nregretted his incapacity, putting it down to the vile education he had\r\nreceived and to his hopelessly aesthetic nature! He suddenly came to\r\nthe conclusion that his vocation in the field of propaganda lay not\r\nin speaking, but in writing. But all the pamphlets he planned did not\r\nwork out somehow. Whatever he attempted to put down on paper, according\r\nto him, was too drawn out, artificial in tone and style, and once or\r\ntwice—oh horror! he actually found himself wandering off into verse, or\r\non a sceptical, personal effusion. He even decided to speak about this\r\ndifficulty to Mariana, a very sure sign of confidence and intimacy! He\r\nwas again surprised to find her sympathetic, not towards his literary\r\nattempts, certainly, but to the moral weakness he was suffering from,\r\na weakness with which she, too, was somewhat familiar. Mariana’s\r\ncontempt for aestheticism was no less strong than his, but for all that\r\nthe main reason why she did not accept Markelov was because there was\r\nnot the slightest trace of the aesthetic in his nature! She did not\r\nfor a moment admit this to herself. It is often the case that what is\r\nstrongest in us remains only a half-suspected secret.\r\n\r\nThus the days went by slowly, with little variety, but with sufficient\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nA curious change was taking place in Nejdanov. He felt dissatisfied with\r\nhimself, that is, with his inactivity, and his words had a constant ring\r\nof bitter self-reproach. But in the innermost depths of his being there\r\nlurked a sense of happiness very soothing to his soul. Was it a result\r\nof the peaceful country life, the summer, the fresh air, dainty food,\r\nbeautiful home, or was it due to the fact that for the first time in\r\nhis life he was tasting the sweetness of contact with a woman’s soul?\r\nIt would be difficult to say. But he felt happy, although he complained,\r\nand quite sincerely, to his friend Silin.\r\n\r\nThe mood, however, was abruptly destroyed in a single day.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of this day Nejdanov received a letter from Vassily\r\nNikolaevitch, instructing him, together with Markelov, to lose no\r\ntime in coming to an understanding with Solomin and a certain merchant\r\nGolushkin, an Old Believer, living at S. This letter upset Nejdanov very\r\nmuch; it contained a note of reproach at his inactivity. The bitterness\r\nwhich had shown itself only in his words now rose with full force from\r\nthe depths of his soul.\r\n\r\nKollomietzev came to dinner, disturbed and agitated. “Would you believe\r\nit!” he shouted almost in tears, “what horrors I’ve read in the papers!\r\nMy friend, my beloved Michael, the Servian prince, has been assassinated\r\nby some blackguards in Belgrade. This is what these Jacobins and\r\nrevolutionists will bring us to if a firm stop is not put to them all!”\r\n Sipiagin permitted himself to remark that this horrible murder was\r\nprobably not the work of Jacobins, “of whom there could hardly be any in\r\nServia,” but might have been committed by some of the followers of the\r\nKarageorgievsky party, enemies of Obrenovitch. Kollomietzev would not\r\nhear of this, and began to relate, in the same tearful voice, how the\r\nlate prince had loved him and what a beautiful gun he had given him!\r\nHaving spent himself somewhat and got rather irritable, he at last\r\nturned from foreign Jacobins to home-bred nihilists and socialists, and\r\nended by flying into a passion. He seized a large roll, and breaking it\r\nin half over his soup plate, in the manner of the stylish Parisian in\r\nthe “Café-Riche,” announced that he would like to tear limb from limb,\r\nreduce to ashes, all those who objected to anybody or to anything! These\r\nwere his very words. “It is high time! High time!” he announced, raising\r\nthe spoon to his mouth; “yes, high time!” he repeated, giving his glass\r\nto the servant, who was pouring out sherry. He spoke reverentially about\r\nthe great Moscow publishers, and _Ladislas, notre bon et cher Ladislas_,\r\ndid not leave his lips. At this point, he fixed his eyes on Nejdanov,\r\nseeming to say: “There, this is for you! Make what you like of it! I\r\nmean this for you! And there’s a lot more to come yet!” The latter,\r\nno longer able to contain himself, objected at last, and began in a\r\nslightly unsteady tone of voice (not due to fear, of course) defending\r\nthe ideals, the hopes, the principles of the modern generation.\r\nKollomietzev soon went into a squeak—his anger always expressed itself\r\nin falsetto—and became abusive. Sipiagin, with a stately air, began\r\ntaking Nejdanov’s part; Valentina Mihailovna, of course, sided with her\r\nhusband; Anna Zaharovna tried to distract Kolia’s attention, looking\r\nfuriously at everybody; Mariana did not move, she seemed turned to\r\nstone.\r\n\r\nNejdanov, hearing the name of _Ladislas_ pronounced at least for the\r\ntwentieth time, suddenly flared up and thumping the palm of his hand on\r\nthe table burst out:\r\n\r\n“What an authority! As if we do not know who this Ladislas is! A born\r\nspy, nothing more!”\r\n\r\n“W-w-w-what—what—did you say?” Kollomietzev stammered cut, choking\r\nwith rage. “How dare you express yourself like that of a man who is\r\nrespected by such people as Prince Blasenkramf and Prince Kovrishkin!”\r\n\r\nNejdanov shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n“A very nice recommendation! Prince Kovrishkin, that enthusiastic\r\nflunky—”\r\n\r\n“Ladislas is my friend,” Kollomietzev screamed, “my comrade—and I—”\r\n\r\n“So much the worse for you,” Nejdanov interrupted him. “It means that\r\nyou share his way of thinking, in which case my words apply to you too.”\r\n\r\nKollomietzev turned deadly pale with passion.\r\n\r\n“W-what? How? You—ought to be—on the spot—”\r\n\r\n“What would you like to do with me _on the spot_?” Nejdanov asked with\r\nsarcastic politeness. Heaven only knows what this skirmish between these\r\ntwo enemies might have led to, had not Sipiagin himself put a stop to it\r\nat the very outset. Raising his voice and putting on a serious air, in\r\nwhich it was difficult to say what predominated most, the gravity of an\r\nimportant statesman or the dignity of a host, he announced firmly that\r\nhe did not wish to hear at his table such immoderate expressions, that\r\nhe had long ago made it a rule, a sacred rule, he added, to respect\r\nevery sort of conviction, so long as (at this point he raised his\r\nforefinger ornamented with a signet ring) it came within the limits of\r\ndecent behaviour; that if he could not help, on the one hand, condemning\r\nMr. Nejdanov’s intemperate words, for which only his extreme youth could\r\nbe blamed, he could not, on the other, agree with Mr. Kollomietzev’s\r\nembittered attack on people of an opposite camp, an attack, he felt\r\nsure, that was only due to an over-amount of zeal for the general\r\nwelfare of society.\r\n\r\n“Under my roof,” he wound up, “under the Sipiagin’s roof, there are\r\nno Jacobins and no spies, only honest, well-meaning people, who, once\r\nlearning to understand one another, would most certainly clasp each\r\nother by the hand!”\r\n\r\nNeither Nejdanov nor Kollomietzev ventured on another word, but they\r\ndid not, however, clasp each other’s hands. Their moment for a mutual\r\nunderstanding had not arrived. On the contrary, they had never yet\r\nexperienced such a strong antipathy to one another.\r\n\r\nDinner ended in an awkward, unpleasant silence. Sipiagin attempted to\r\nrelate some diplomatic anecdote, but stopped half-way through. Mariana\r\nkept looking down at her plate persistently, not wishing to betray her\r\nsympathy with what Nejdanov had said. She was by no means afraid, but\r\ndid not wish to give herself away before Madame Sipiagina. She felt\r\nthe latter’s keen, penetrating glance fixed on her. And, indeed,\r\nMadame Sipiagina did not take her eyes either off her or Nejdanov. His\r\nunexpected outburst at first came as a surprise to the intelligent\r\nlady, but the next moment a light suddenly dawned upon her, so that she\r\ninvoluntarily murmured, “Ah!” She suddenly divined that Nejdanov was\r\nslipping away from her, this same Nejdanov who, a short time ago, was\r\nready to come to her arms. “Something has happened.... Is it Mariana? Of\r\ncourse it’s Mariana...She likes him... and he—”\r\n\r\n“Something must be done.” Thus she concluded her reflections, while\r\nKollomietzev was choking with indignation. Even when playing preference\r\ntwo hours later, he pronounced the word “Pass!” or “I buy!” with an\r\naching heart. A hoarse tremulo of wounded pride could be detected in his\r\nvoice, although he pretended to scorn such things! Sipiagin was the only\r\none really pleased with the scene. It had afforded him an opportunity of\r\nshowing off the power of his eloquence and of calming the rising storm.\r\nHe knew Latin, and Virgil’s _Quos ego_ was not unfamiliar to him. He did\r\nnot consciously compare himself to Neptune, but thought of him with a\r\nkind of sympathetic feeling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was convenient for him to do so, Nejdanov retired to his\r\nown room and locked himself in. He did not want to see anyone, anyone\r\nexcept Mariana. Her room was situated at the very end of a long\r\ncorridor, intersecting the whole of the upper story. Nejdanov had only\r\nonce been there for a few moments, but it seemed to him that she would\r\nnot mind if he knocked at her door, now that she even wished to speak to\r\nhim herself. It was already fairly late, about ten o’clock. The host and\r\nhostess had not considered it necessary to disturb him after what had\r\ntaken place at the dinner table. Valentina Mihailovna inquired once\r\nor twice about Mariana, as she too had disappeared soon after dinner.\r\n“Where is Mariana Vikentievna?” she asked first in Russian, then in\r\nFrench, addressing herself to no one in particular, but rather to the\r\nwalls, as people often do when greatly astonished, but she soon became\r\nabsorbed in the game.\r\n\r\nNejdanov paced up and down the room several times, then turned down the\r\ncorridor and knocked gently at Mariana’s door. There was no response. He\r\nknocked again—then he turned the handle of the door. It was locked.\r\nBut he had hardly got back to his own room and sat down, when the door\r\ncreaked softly and Mariana’s voice was heard: “Alexai Dmitritch, was\r\nthat _you_ came to me?”\r\n\r\nHe jumped up instantly and rushed out into the corridor. Mariana was\r\nstanding at his door with a candle in her hand, pale and motionless.\r\n\r\n“Yes... I—” he murmured.\r\n\r\n“Come,” she said, turning down the corridor, but before reaching the end\r\nshe stopped and pushed open a low door. Nejdanov looked into a small,\r\nalmost bare room.\r\n\r\n“We had better go in here, Alexai Dmitritch, no one will disturb us\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\nNejdanov obeyed. Mariana put the candlestick on a window-sill and turned\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n“I understand why you wanted to see me,” she began. “It is wretched for\r\nyou to live in this house, and for me too.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I wanted to see you, Mariana Vikentievna,” Nejdanov replied, “but\r\nI do not feel wretched here since I’ve come to know you.”\r\n\r\nMariana smiled pensively.\r\n\r\n“Thank you, Alexai Dmitritch. But tell me, do you really intend stopping\r\nhere after all that has happened?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t think they will keep me—I shall be dismissed,” Nejdanov\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n“But don’t you intend going away of your own accord?”\r\n\r\n“I... No!”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“Do you want to know the truth? Because _you_ are here.” Mariana\r\nlowered her head and moved a little further down the room.\r\n\r\n“Besides,” Nejdanov continued, “I _must_ stay here. You know\r\nnothing—but I want—I feel that I must tell you everything.” He\r\napproached Mariana and seized her hand; she did not take it away, but\r\nonly looked straight into his face. “Listen!” he exclaimed with sudden\r\nforce, “Listen!”\r\n\r\nAnd instantly, without stopping to sit down, although there were two\r\nor three chairs in the room, still standing before her and holding her\r\nhand, with heated enthusiasm and with an eloquence, surprising even to\r\nhimself, he began telling her all his plans, his intentions, his\r\nreason for having accepted Sipiagin’s offer, about all his connections,\r\nacquaintances, about his past, things that he had always kept hidden\r\nfrom everybody. He told her about Vassily Nikolaevitch’s letters,\r\neverything—even about Silin! He spoke hurriedly, without a single pause\r\nor the smallest hesitation, as if he were reproaching himself for not\r\nhaving entrusted her with all his secrets before—as if he were\r\nbegging her pardon. She listened to him attentively, greedily; she\r\nwas bewildered at first, but this feeling soon wore off. Her heart was\r\noverflowing with gratitude, pride, devotion, resoluteness. Her face and\r\neyes shone; she laid her other hand on Nejdanov’s—her lips parted in\r\necstasy. She became marvellously beautiful!\r\n\r\nHe ceased at last, and suddenly seemed to see _this_ face for the first\r\ntime, although it was so dear and so familiar to him. He gave a deep\r\nsigh.\r\n\r\n“Ah! how well I did to tell you everything!” He was scarcely able to\r\narticulate the words.\r\n\r\n“Yes, how well—how well!” she repeated, also in a whisper. She imitated\r\nhim unconsciously—her voice, too, gave way. “And it means,” she\r\ncontinued, “that I am at your disposal, that I want to be useful to your\r\ncause, that I am ready to do anything that may be necessary, go wherever\r\nyou may want me to, that I have always longed with my whole soul for all\r\nthe things that you want—”\r\n\r\nShe also ceased. Another word—and her emotion would have dissolved into\r\ntears. All the strength and force of her nature suddenly softened as\r\nwax. She was consumed with a thirst for activity, for self-sacrifice,\r\nfor immediate self-sacrifice.\r\n\r\nA sound of footsteps was heard from the other side of the door—light,\r\nrapid, cautious footsteps.\r\n\r\nMariana suddenly drew herself up and disengaged her hands; her mood\r\nchanged, she became quite cheerful, a certain audacious, scornful\r\nexpression flitted across her face.\r\n\r\n“I know who is listening behind the door at this moment,” she remarked,\r\nso loudly that every word could be heard distinctly in the corridor;\r\n“Madame Sipiagina is listening to us... but it makes no difference to\r\nme.”\r\n\r\nThe footsteps ceased.\r\n\r\n“Well?” Mariana asked, turning to Nejdanov. “What shall I do? How shall\r\nI help you? Tell me... tell me quickly! What shall I do?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know yet,” Nejdanov replied. “I have received a note from\r\nMarkelov—”\r\n\r\n“When did you receive it? When?”\r\n\r\n“This evening. He and I must go and see Solomin at the factory\r\ntomorrow.”\r\n\r\n“Yes... yes.... What a splendid man Markelov is! Now he’s a real\r\nfriend!”\r\n\r\n“Like me?”\r\n\r\n“No—not like you.”\r\n\r\n“How?”\r\n\r\nShe turned away suddenly.\r\n\r\n“Oh! Don’t you understand what you have become for me, and what I am\r\nfeeling at this moment?”\r\n\r\nNejdanov’s heart beat violently; he looked down. This girl who loved\r\nhim—a poor, homeless wretch, who trusted him, who was ready to\r\nfollow him, pursue the same cause together with him—this wonderful\r\ngirl—Mariana—became for Nejdanov at this moment the incarnation of\r\nall earthly truth and goodness—the incarnation of the love of mother,\r\nsister, wife, all the things he had never known; the incarnation of his\r\ncountry, happiness, struggle, freedom!\r\n\r\nHe raised his head and encountered her eyes fixed on him again.\r\n\r\nOh, how this sweet, bright glance penetrated to his very soul!\r\n\r\n“And so,” he began in an unsteady voice, “I am going away tomorrow....\r\nAnd when I come back, I will tell... you—” (he suddenly felt it awkward\r\nto address Mariana as “you”) “tell you everything that is decided upon.\r\nFrom now on everything that I do and think, everything, I will tell thee\r\nfirst.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, my dear!” Mariana exclaimed, seizing his hand again. “I promise\r\nthee the same!”\r\n\r\nThe word “thee” escaped her lips just as simply and easily as if they\r\nhad been old comrades.\r\n\r\n“Have you got the letter?”\r\n\r\n“Here it is.”\r\n\r\nMariana scanned the letter and looked up at him almost reverently.\r\n\r\n“Do they entrust you with such important commissions?” He smiled in\r\nreply and put the letter back in his pocket. “How curious,” he said, “we\r\nhave come to know of our love, we love one another—and yet we have not\r\nsaid a single word about it.”\r\n\r\n“There is no need,” Mariana whispered, and suddenly threw her arms\r\naround his neck and pressed her head closely against his breast. They\r\ndid not kiss—it would have seemed to them too commonplace and rather\r\nterrible—but instantly took leave of one another, tightly clasping each\r\nother’s hands.\r\n\r\nMariana returned for the candle which she had left on the window-sill\r\nof the empty room. Only then a sort of bewilderment came over her; she\r\nextinguished the candle and, gliding quickly along the dark corridor,\r\nentered her own room, undressed and went to bed in the soothing\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nOn awakening the following morning, Nejdanov did not feel the slightest\r\nembarrassment at what had taken place the previous night, but was, on\r\nthe contrary, filled with a sort of quiet joy, as if he had fulfilled\r\nsomething which ought to have been done long ago. Asking for two days’\r\nleave from Sipiagin, who consented readily, though with a certain amount\r\nof severity, Nejdanov set out for Markelov’s. Before his departure he\r\nmanaged to see Mariana. She was also not in the least abashed, looked\r\nat him calmly and resolutely, and called him “dear” quite naturally.\r\nShe was very much concerned about what he might hear at Markelov’s, and\r\nbegged him to tell her everything.\r\n\r\n“Of course!” he replied. “After all,” he thought, “why should we be\r\ndisturbed? In our friendship personal feeling played only... a secondary\r\npart, and we are united forever. In the name of the cause? Yes, in the\r\nname of the cause!”\r\n\r\nThus Nejdanov thought, and he did not himself suspect how much truth and\r\nhow much falsehood there lay in his reflections.\r\n\r\nHe found Markelov in the same weary, sullen frame of mind. After a very\r\nimpromptu dinner they set out in the well-known carriage to the merchant\r\nFalyeva’s cotton factory where Solomin lived. (The second side horse\r\nharnessed to the carriage was a young colt that had never been in\r\nharness before. Markelov’s own horse was still a little lame.)\r\n\r\nNejdanov’s curiosity had been aroused. He very much wanted to become\r\ncloser acquainted with a man about whom he had heard so much of late.\r\nSolomin had been informed of their coming, so that as soon as the two\r\ntravellers stopped at the gates of the factory and announced who they\r\nwere, they were immediately conducted into the hideous little wing\r\noccupied by the “engineering manager.” He was at that time in the\r\nmain body of the building, and while one of the workmen ran to fetch\r\nhim, Nejdanov and Markelov managed to go up to the window and look\r\naround. The factory was apparently in a very flourishing condition\r\nand over-loaded with work. From every corner came the quick buzzing\r\nsound of unceasing activity; the puffing and rattling of machines, the\r\ncreaking of looms, the humming of wheels, the whirling of straps, while\r\ntrolleys, barrels, and loaded carts were rolling in and out. Orders\r\nwere shouted out at the top of the voice amidst the sound of bells and\r\nwhistles; workmen in blouses with girdles round their waists, their\r\nhair fastened with straps, work girls in print dresses, hurried quickly\r\nto and fro, harnessed horses were led about.... It represented the hum\r\nof a thousand human beings working with all their might. Everything\r\nwent at full speed in fairly regular order, but not only was there\r\nan absence of smartness and neatness, but there was not the smallest\r\ntrace or cleanliness to be seen anywhere. On the contrary, in every\r\ncorner one was struck by neglect, dirt, grime; here a pane of glass was\r\nbroken, there the plaster was coming off; in another place the boards\r\nwere loose; in a third, a door gaped wide open. A large filthy puddle\r\ncovered with a coating of rainbow-coloured slime stood in the middle\r\nof the main yard; farther on lay a heap of discarded bricks; scraps\r\nof mats and matting, boxes, and pieces of rope lay scattered here and\r\nthere; shaggy, hungry-looking dogs wandered to and fro, too listless\r\nto bark; in a corner, under the fence, sat a grimy little boy of about\r\nfour, with an enormous belly and dishevelled head, crying hopelessly,\r\nas if he had been forsaken by the whole world; close by a sow likewise\r\nbesmeared in soot and surrounded by a medley of little suckling-pigs\r\nwas devouring some cabbage stalks; some ragged clothes were stretched\r\non a line—and such stuffiness and stench! In a word, just like a\r\nRussian factory—not like a French or a German one.\r\n\r\nNejdanov looked at Markelov.\r\n\r\n“I have heard so much about Solomin’s superior capabilities,” he began,\r\n“that I confess all this disorder surprises me. I did not expect it.”\r\n\r\n“This is not disorder, but the usual Russian slovenliness,” Markelov\r\nreplied gloomily. “But all the same, they are turning over millions.\r\nSolomin has to adjust himself to the old ways, to practical things, and\r\nto the owner himself. Have you any idea what Falyeva is like?”\r\n\r\n“Not in the least.”\r\n\r\n“He is the biggest skinflint in Moscow. A regular bourgeois.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment Solomin entered the room. Nejdanov was just as\r\ndisillusioned about him as he had been about the factory. At the first\r\nglance he gave one the impression of being a Finn or a Swede. He was\r\ntall, lean, broad-shouldered, with colourless eyebrows and eyelashes;\r\nhad a long sallow face, a short, rather broad nose, small greenish eyes,\r\na placid expression, coarse thick lips, large teeth, and a divided chin\r\ncovered with a suggestion of down. He was dressed like a mechanic or a\r\nstoker in an old pea-jacket with baggy pockets, with an oil-skin cap on\r\nhis head, a woollen scarf round his neck, and tarred boots on his feet.\r\nHe was accompanied by a man of about forty in a peasant coat, who had an\r\nextraordinarily lively gipsy-like face, coal-black piercing eyes, with\r\nwhich he scanned Nejdanov as soon as he entered the room. Markelov was\r\nalready known to him. This was Pavel, Solomin’s _factotum_.\r\n\r\nSolomin approached the two visitors slowly and without a word, pressed\r\nthe hand of each in turn in his own hard bony one. He opened a drawer,\r\npulled out a sealed letter, which he handed to Pavel, also without\r\na word, and the latter immediately left the room. Then he stretched\r\nhimself, threw away his cap with one wave of the hand, sat down on\r\na painted wooden stool and, pointing to a couch, begged Nejdanov and\r\nMarkelov to be seated.\r\n\r\nMarkelov first introduced Nejdanov, whom Solomin again shook by the\r\nhand, then he went on to “business,” mentioning Vassily Nikolaevitch’s\r\nletter, which Nejdanov handed to Solomin. And while the latter was\r\nreading it carefully, his eyes moving from line to line, Nejdanov sat\r\nwatching him. Solomin was near the window and the sun, already low\r\nin the horizon, was shining full on his tanned face covered with\r\nperspiration, on his fair hair covered with dust, making it sparkle like\r\na mass of gold. His nostrils quivered and distended as he read, and\r\nhis lips moved as though he were forming every word. He held the letter\r\nraised tightly in both hands, and when he had finished returned it to\r\nNejdanov and began listening to Markelov again. The latter talked until\r\nhe had exhausted himself.\r\n\r\n“I am afraid,” Solomin began (his hoarse voice, full of youth\r\nand strength, was pleasing to Nejdanov’s ear), “it will be rather\r\ninconvenient to talk here. Why not go to your place? It is only a\r\nquestion of seven miles. You came in your carriage, did you not?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I suppose you can make room for me. I shall have finished my\r\nwork in about an hour, and will be quite free. We can talk things\r\nover thoroughly. You are also free, are you not?” he asked, turning to\r\nNejdanov.\r\n\r\n“Until the day after tomorrow.”\r\n\r\n“That’s all right. We can stay the night at your place, Sergai\r\nMihailovitch, I suppose?”\r\n\r\n“Of course you may!”\r\n\r\n“Good. I shall be ready in a minute. I’ll just make myself a little more\r\npresentable.”\r\n\r\n“And how are things at your factory?” Nejdanov asked significantly.\r\n\r\nSolomin looked away.\r\n\r\n“We can talk things over thoroughly,” he remarked a second time.\r\n“Please excuse me a moment.... I’ll be back directly.... I’ve forgotten\r\nsomething.”\r\n\r\nHe went out. Had he not already produced a good impression on Nejdanov,\r\nthe latter would have thought that he was backing out, but such an idea\r\ndid not occur to him.\r\n\r\nAn hour later, when from every story, every staircase and door of the\r\nenormous building, a noisy crowd of workpeople came streaming out, the\r\ncarriage containing Markelov, Nejdanov, and Solomin drove out of the\r\ngates on to the road.\r\n\r\n“Vassily Fedotitch! Is it to be done?” Pavel shouted after Solomin, whom\r\nhe had accompanied to the gate.\r\n\r\n“No, not now,” Solomin replied. “He wanted to know about some night\r\nwork,” he explained, turning to his companions.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached Borsionkov they had some supper, merely for the sake\r\nof politeness, and afterwards lighted cigars and began a discussion, one\r\nof those interminable, midnight Russian discussions which in degree and\r\nlength are only peculiar to Russians and unequalled by people of any\r\nother nationality. During the discussion, too, Solomin did not come up\r\nto Nejdanov’s expectation. He spoke little—so little that one might\r\nalmost have said that he was quite silent. But he listened attentively,\r\nand whenever he made any remark or gave an opinion, did so briefly,\r\nseriously, showing a considerable amount of common-sense. Solomin did\r\nnot believe that the Russian revolution was so near at hand, but not\r\nwishing to act as a wet blanket on others, he did not intrude his\r\nopinions or hinder others from making attempts. He looked on from a\r\ndistance as it were, but was still a comrade by their side. He knew\r\nthe St. Petersburg revolutionists and agreed with their ideas up to a\r\ncertain point. He himself belonged to the people, and fully realised\r\nthat the great bulk of them, without whom one can do nothing, were still\r\nquite indifferent, that they must first be prepared, by quite different\r\nmeans and for entirely different ends than the upper classes. So he held\r\naloof, not from a sense of superiority, but as an ordinary man with a\r\nfew independent ideas, who did not wish to ruin himself or others in\r\nvain. But as for listening, there was no harm in that.\r\n\r\nSolomin was the only son of a deacon and had five sisters, who were all\r\nmarried to priests or deacons. He was also destined for the church, but\r\nwith his father’s consent threw it up and began to study mathematics,\r\nas he had taken a special liking to mechanics. He entered a factory of\r\nwhich the owner was an Englishman, who got to love him like his own son.\r\nThis man supplied him with the means of going to Manchester, where he\r\nstayed for two years, acquiring an excellent knowledge of the English\r\nlanguage. With the Moscow merchant he had fallen in but a short time\r\nago. He was exacting with his subordinates, a manner he had acquired\r\nin England, but they liked him nevertheless, and treated him as one of\r\nthemselves. His father was very proud of him, and used to speak of him\r\nas a steady sort of man, but was very grieved that he did not marry and\r\nsettle down.\r\n\r\nDuring the discussion, as we have already said, Solomin sat silent the\r\nwhole time; but when Markelov began enlarging upon the hopes they put\r\non the factory workers, Solomin remarked, in his usual laconic way, that\r\nthey must not depend too much on them, as factory workers in Russia were\r\nnot what they were abroad. “They are an extremely mild set of people\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\n“And what about the peasants?”\r\n\r\n“The peasants? There are a good many sweaters and money-lenders among\r\nthem now, and there are likely to be more in time. This kind only look\r\nto their own interests, and as for the others, they are as ignorant as\r\nsheep.”\r\n\r\n“Then where are we to turn to?” Solomin smiled.\r\n\r\n“Seek and ye shall find.”\r\n\r\nThere was a constant smile on his lips, but the smile was as full of\r\nmeaning as the man himself. With Nejdanov he behaved in a very peculiar\r\nmanner. He was attracted to the young student and felt an almost tender\r\nsympathy for him. At one part of the discussion, where Nejdanov broke\r\nout into a perfect torrent of words, Solomin got up quietly, moved\r\nacross the room with long strides, and shut a window that was standing\r\nopen just above Nejdanov’s head.\r\n\r\n“You might catch cold,” he observed, in answer to the orator’s look of\r\namazement.\r\n\r\nNejdanov began to question him about his factory, asking if any\r\ncooperative experiments had been made, if anything had been done so that\r\nthe workers might come in for a share of the profits.\r\n\r\n“My dear fellow!” Solomin exclaimed, “I instituted a school and a tiny\r\nhospital, and even then the owner struggled like a bear!”\r\n\r\nSolomin lost his temper once in real earnest on hearing of some legal\r\ninjustice about the suppression of a workman’s association. He banged\r\nhis powerful fist on the table so that everything on it trembled,\r\nincluding a forty-pound weight, which happened to be lying near the ink\r\npot.\r\n\r\nWhen Markelov and Nejdanov began discussing ways and means of executing\r\ntheir plans, Solomin listened with respectful curiosity, but did not\r\npronounce a single word. Their talk lasted until four o’clock in the\r\nmorning, when they had touched upon almost everything under the sun.\r\nMarkelov again spoke mysteriously of Kisliakov’s untiring journeys and\r\nhis letters, which were becoming more interesting than ever. He promised\r\nto show them to Nejdanov, saying that he would probably have to take\r\nthem away with him, as they were rather lengthy and written in an\r\nillegible handwriting. He assured him that there was a great deal of\r\nlearning in them and even poetry, not of the frivolous kind, but poetry\r\nwith a socialistic tendency!\r\n\r\nFrom Kisliakov, Markelov went on to the military, to adjutants, Germans,\r\neven got so far as his articles on the shortcomings of the artillery,\r\nwhilst Nejdanov spoke about the antagonism between Heine and Borne,\r\nProudhon, and realism in art. Solomin alone sat listening and\r\nreflecting, the smile never leaving his lips. Without having uttered a\r\nsingle word, he seemed to understand better than the others where the\r\nessential difficulty lay.\r\n\r\nThe hour struck four. Nejdanov and Markelov could scarcely stand on\r\ntheir legs from exhaustion, while Solomin was as fresh as could be. They\r\nparted for the night, having agreed to go to town the next day to see\r\nthe merchant Golushkin, an Old Believer, who was said to be very zealous\r\nand promised proselytes.\r\n\r\nSolomin doubted whether it was worth while going, but agreed to go in\r\nthe end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nMarkelov’s guests were still asleep when a messenger with a letter\r\ncame to him from his sister, Madame Sipiagina. In this letter Valentina\r\nMihailovna spoke about various little domestic details, asked him to\r\nreturn a book he had borrowed, and added, by the way, in a postscript,\r\nthe very “amusing” piece of news that his old flame Mariana was in love\r\nwith the tutor Nejdanov and he with her. This was not merely gossip, but\r\nshe, Valentina Mihailovna, had seen with her own eyes and heard with her\r\nown ears. Markelov’s face grew blacker than night, but he did not utter\r\na word. He ordered the book to be returned, and when he caught sight of\r\nNejdanov coming downstairs, greeted him just as usual and did not even\r\nforget to give him the promised packet of Kisliakov’s letters. He did\r\nnot stay with him however, but went out to see to the farm.\r\n\r\nNejdanov returned to his own room and glanced through the letters.\r\nThe young propagandist spoke mostly about himself, about his unsparing\r\nactivity. According to him, during the last month, he had been in\r\nno less than eleven provinces, nine towns, twenty-nine villages,\r\nfifty-three hamlets, one farmhouse, and seven factories. Sixteen nights\r\nhe had slept in hay-lofts, one in a stable, another even in a cow-shed\r\n(here he wrote, in parenthesis, that fleas did not worry him); he\r\nhad wheedled himself into mud-huts, workmen’s barracks, had preached,\r\ntaught, distributed pamphlets, and collected information; some things he\r\nhad made a note of on the spot; others he carried in his memory by the\r\nvery latest method of mnemonics. He had written fourteen long letters,\r\ntwenty-eight shorter ones, and eighteen notes, four of which were\r\nwritten in pencil, one in blood, and another in soot and water. All\r\nthis he had managed to do because he had learned how to divide his time\r\nsystematically, according to the examples set by men such as Quintin\r\nJohnson, Karrelius, Sverlitskov, and other writers and statisticians.\r\nThen he went on to talk of himself again, of his guiding star, saying\r\nhow he had supplemented Fourier’s passions by being the first to\r\ndiscover the “fundaments, the root principle,” and how he would not\r\ngo out of this world without leaving some trace behind him; how he was\r\nfilled with wonder that he, a youth of twenty-four, should have solved\r\nall the problems of life and science; that he would turn the whole of\r\nRussia up-side-down, that he would “shake her up!” “Dixi!!” he added at\r\nthe end of the paragraph. This word “Dixi” appeared very frequently in\r\nKisliakov’s letters, and always with a double exclamation mark. In one\r\nof the letters there were some verses with a socialist tendency, written\r\nto a certain young lady, beginning with the words—\r\n\r\n    Love not me, but the idea!\r\n\r\nNejdanov marvelled inwardly, not so much at Kisliakov’s conceit, as at\r\nMarkelov’s honest simplicity. “Bother aestheticism! Mr. Kisliakov may be\r\neven useful,” he thought to himself instantly.\r\n\r\nThe three friends gathered together for tea in the dining-room, but\r\nlast night’s conversation was not renewed between them. Not one of them\r\nwished to talk, but Solomin was the only one who sat silent peacefully.\r\nBoth Nejdanov and Markelov seemed inwardly agitated. After tea they\r\nset out for the town. Markelov’s old servant, who was sitting on the\r\ndoorstep, accompanied his former master with his habitual dejected\r\nglance.\r\n\r\nThe merchant Golushkin, with whom it was necessary to acquaint\r\nNejdanov, was the son of a wealthy merchant in drugs, an Old Believer,\r\nof the Thedosian sect. He had not increased the fortune left to him\r\nby his father, being, as the saying goes, a _joueur_, an Epicurean in\r\nthe Russian fashion, with absolutely no business abilities. He was\r\na man of forty, rather stout and ugly, pock-marked, with small eyes\r\nlike a pig’s. He spoke hurriedly, swallowing his words as it were,\r\ngesticulated with his hands, threw his legs about and went into roars\r\nof laughter at everything. On the whole, he gave one the impression of\r\nbeing a stupid, spoiled, conceited bounder. He considered himself a\r\nman of culture because he dressed in the German fashion, kept an open\r\nhouse (though it was not overly clean), frequented the theatre, and\r\nhad many protégées among variety actresses, with whom he conversed in\r\nsome extraordinary jargon meant to be French. His principal passion was\r\na thirst for popularity. “Let the name of Golushkin thunder through\r\nthe world! As once Suvorov or Potyomkin, then why not now Kapiton\r\nGolushkin?” It was this very passion, conquering even his innate\r\nmeanness, which had thrown him, as he himself expressed it not without\r\na touch of pride, “into the arms of the opposition” (formerly he used\r\nto say “position,” but had learned better since then) and brought\r\nhim in contact with the nihilists. He gave expression to the most\r\nextreme views, scoffed at his own Old Believer’s faith, ate meat in\r\nLent, played cards, and drank champagne like water. He never got into\r\ndifficulties, because he said, “Wherever necessary, I have bribed the\r\nauthorities. All holes are stitched up, all mouths are closed, all ears\r\nare stopped.”\r\n\r\nHe was a widower without children. His sister’s sons fawned around him\r\ncontinuously, but he called them a lot of ignorant louts, barbarians,\r\nand would hardly look at them. He lived in a large, stone house, kept in\r\nrather a slovenly manner. Some of the rooms were furnished with foreign\r\nfurniture, others contained nothing but a few painted wooden chairs and\r\na couch covered with American cloth. There were pictures everywhere of\r\nan indifferent variety. Fiery landscapes, purple seascapes, fat naked\r\nwomen with pink-coloured knees and elbows, and “The Kiss” by Moller. In\r\nspite of the fact that Golushkin had no family, there were a great many\r\nmenials and hangers-on collected under his roof. He did not receive them\r\nfrom any feeling of generosity, but simply from a desire to be popular\r\nand to have someone at his beck and call. “My clients,” he used to say\r\nwhen he wished to throw dust in one’s eyes. He read very little, but had\r\nan excellent memory for learned expressions.\r\n\r\nThe young people found Golushkin in his study, where he was sitting\r\ncomfortably wrapped up in a long dressing-gown, with a cigar between his\r\nlips, pretending to be reading a newspaper. On their entrance he\r\njumped up, rushed up to them, went red in the face, shouted for some\r\nrefreshments to be brought quickly, asked them some questions, laughed\r\nfor no reason in particular, and all this in one breath. He knew\r\nMarkelov and Solomin, but had not yet met Nejdanov. On hearing that the\r\nlatter was a student, he broke into another laugh, pressed his hand a\r\nsecond time, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n“Splendid! Splendid! We are gathering forces! Learning is light,\r\nignorance is darkness—I had a wretched education myself, but I\r\nunderstand things; that’s how I’ve got on!”\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Nejdanov that Golushkin was shy and embarrassed—and\r\nindeed it really was so. “Take care, brother Kapiton! Mind what you\r\nare about!” was his first thought on meeting a new person. He soon\r\nrecovered himself however, and began in the same hurried, lisping,\r\nconfused tone of voice, talking about Vassily Nikolaevitch, about his\r\ntemperament, about the necessity of pro-pa-ganda (he knew this word\r\nquite well, but articulated it slowly), saying that he, Golushkin,\r\nhad discovered a certain promising young chap, that the time had now\r\ncome, that the time was now ripe for... for the lancet (at this word he\r\nglanced at Markelov, but the latter did not stir). He then turned to\r\nNejdanov and began speaking of himself in no less glowing terms than\r\nthe distinguished correspondent Kisliakov, saying that he had long\r\nago ceased being a fool, that he fully recognised the rights of the\r\nproletariat (he remembered this word splendidly), that although he had\r\nactually given up commerce and taken to banking instead with a view to\r\nincreasing his capital, yet only so that this same capital could at any\r\ngiven moment be called upon for the use... for the use of the cause,\r\nthat is to say, for the use of the people, and that he, Golushkin, in\r\nreality, despised wealth! At this point a servant entered with some\r\nrefreshment; Golushkin cleared his throat significantly, asked if they\r\nwould not partake of something, and was the first to gulp down a glass\r\nof strong pepper-brandy. The guests partook of refreshments. Golushkin\r\nthrust huge pieces of caviar into his mouth and drank incessantly,\r\nsaying every now and again, “Come, gentlemen, come, some splendid\r\nMacon, please!” Turning to Nejdanov, he began asking him where he\r\nhad come from, where he was staying and for how long, and on hearing\r\nthat he was staying at Sipiagin’s, exclaimed: “I know this gentleman!\r\nNothing in him whatever!” and instantly began abusing all the\r\nlandowners in the province because, he said, not only were they void of\r\npublic spirit, but they did not even understand their own interests.\r\n\r\nBut, strange to say, in spite of his being so abusive, his eyes wandered\r\nabout uneasily. Nejdanov could not make him out at all, and wondered\r\nwhat possible use he could be to them. Solomin was silent as usual and\r\nMarkelov wore such a gloomy expression that Nejdanov could not help\r\nasking what was the matter with him. Markelov declared that it was\r\nnothing in a tone in which people commonly let you understand that there\r\nis something wrong, but that it does not concern you. Golushkin again\r\nstarted abusing someone or other and then went on to praise the new\r\ngeneration. “Such clever chaps they are nowadays! Clever chaps!” Solomin\r\ninterrupted him by asking about the hopeful young man whom he had\r\nmentioned and where he had discovered him. Golushkin laughed, repeating\r\nonce or twice, “Just wait, you will see! You will see!” and began\r\nquestioning him about his factory and its “rogue” of an owner, to\r\nwhich Solomin replied in monosyllables. Then Golushkin poured them all\r\nchampagne, and bending over to Nejdanov, whispered in his ear, “To the\r\nrepublic!” and drank off his glass at a gulp. Nejdanov merely put\r\nhis lips to the glass; Solomin said that he did not take wine in the\r\nmorning; and Markelov angrily and resolutely drank his glass to the last\r\ndrop. He was torn by impatience. “Here we are coolly wasting our time\r\nand not tackling the real matter in hand.” He struck a blow on the\r\ntable, exclaiming severely, “Gentlemen!” and began to speak.\r\n\r\nBut at this moment there entered a sleek, consumptive-looking man with a\r\nlong neck, in a merchant’s coat of nankeen, and arms outstretched like\r\na bird. He bowed to the whole company and, approaching Golushkin,\r\ncommunicated something to him in a whisper.\r\n\r\n“In a minute! In a minute!” the latter exclaimed, hurriedly.\r\n“Gentlemen,” he added, “I must ask you to excuse me. Vasia, my clerk,\r\nhas just told me of such a little piece of news” (Golushkin expressed\r\nhimself thus purposely by way of a joke) “which absolutely necessitates\r\nmy leaving you for awhile. But I hope, gentlemen, that you will come and\r\nhave dinner with me at three o’clock. Then we shall be more free!”\r\n\r\nNeither Solomin nor Nejdanov knew what to say, but Markelov replied\r\ninstantly, with that same severity in his face and voice:\r\n\r\n“Of course we will come.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks very much,” Golushkin said hastily, and bending down to\r\nMarkelov, added, “I will give a thousand roubles for the cause in any\r\ncase.... Don’t be afraid of that!”\r\n\r\nAnd so saying, he waved his right hand three times, with the thumb and\r\nlittle finger sticking out. “You may rely on me!” he added.\r\n\r\nHe accompanied his guests to the door, shouting, “I shall expect you at\r\nthree!”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” Markelov was the only one to reply.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen!” Solomin exclaimed as soon as they found themselves in the\r\nstreet, “I am going to take a cab and go straight back to the factory.\r\nWhat can we do here until dinnertime? A sheer waste of time, kicking our\r\nheels about, and I am afraid our worthy merchant is like the well-known\r\ngoat, neither good for milk nor for wool.”\r\n\r\n“The wool is there right enough,” Markelov observed gloomily. “He\r\npromised to give us some money. Don’t you like him? Unfortunately, we\r\ncan’t pick and choose. People do not run after us exactly.”\r\n\r\n“I am not fastidious,” Solomin said calmly. “I merely thought that\r\nmy presence would not do much good. However,” he added, glancing at\r\nNejdanov with a smile, “I will stay if you like. Even death is bearable\r\nin good company.”\r\n\r\nMarkelov raised his head.\r\n\r\n“Supposing we go into the public garden. The weather is lovely. We can\r\nsit and look at the people.”\r\n\r\n“Come along.”\r\n\r\nThey moved on; Markelov and Solomin in front, Nejdanov in the rear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\nStrange was the state of Nejdanov’s soul. In the last two days so many\r\nnew sensations, new faces.... For the first time in his life he had come\r\nin close contact with a girl whom in all probability he loved. He was\r\npresent at the beginning of the movement for which in all probability\r\nhe was to devote his whole life.... Well? Was he glad? No.... Was he\r\nwavering? Was he afraid? Confused? Oh, certainly not! Did he at any rate\r\nfeel that straining of the whole being, that longing to be among the\r\nfirst ranks, which is always inspired by the first approach of the\r\nbattle? Again, No. Did he really believe in this cause? Did he believe\r\nin his love? “Oh, cursed aesthetic! Sceptic!” his lips murmured\r\ninaudibly. Why this weariness, this disinclination to speak, unless it\r\nbe shouting or raving? What is this inner voice that he wishes to drown\r\nby his shrieking? But Mariana, this delightful, faithful comrade,\r\nthis pure, passionate soul, this wonderful girl, does she not love him\r\nindeed? And these two beings in front of him, this Markelov and Solomin,\r\nwhom he as yet knew but little, but to whom he was attracted so\r\nmuch, were they not excellent types of the Russian people—of Russian\r\nlife—and was it not a happiness in itself to be closely connected with\r\nthem? Then why this vague, uneasy, gnawing sensation? Why this sadness?\r\nIf you’re such a melancholy dreamer, his lips murmured again, what sort\r\nof a revolutionist will you make? You ought to write verses, languish,\r\nnurse your own insignificant thoughts and sensations, amuse yourself\r\nwith psychological fancies and subtleties of all sorts, but don’t at\r\nany rate mistake your sickly, nervous irritability and caprices for\r\nthe manly wrath, the honest anger, of a man of convictions! Oh Hamlet!\r\nHamlet! Thou Prince of Denmark! How escape from the shadow of thy\r\nspirit? How cease to imitate thee in everything, even to revelling\r\nshamelessly in one’s own self-depreciation? Just then, as the echo of\r\nhis own thoughts, he heard a familiar squeaky voice exclaim, “Alexai!\r\nAlexai! Hamlet of Russia! Is it you I behold?” and raising his eyes,\r\nto his great astonishment, saw Paklin standing before him! Paklin, in\r\nArcadian attire, consisting of a summer suit of flesh-colour, without\r\na tie, a large straw hat, trimmed with pale blue ribbon, pushed to the\r\nback of his head, and patent shoes!\r\n\r\nHe limped up to Nejdanov quickly and seized his hand.\r\n\r\n“In the first place,” he began, “although we are in the public garden,\r\nwe must for the sake of old times embrace and kiss.... One! two! three!\r\nSecondly, I must tell you, that had I not run across you to-day you\r\nwould most certainly have seen me tomorrow. I know where you live and\r\nhave come to this town expressly to see you... how and why I will tell\r\nyou later. Thirdly, introduce me to your friends. Tell me briefly who\r\nthey are, and tell them who I am, and then let us proceed to enjoy\r\nourselves!”\r\n\r\nNejdanov responded to his friend’s request, introduced them to each\r\nother, explaining who each was, where he lived, his profession, and so\r\non.\r\n\r\n“Splendid!” Paklin exclaimed. “And now let me lead you all far from the\r\ncrowd, though there is not much of it here, certainly, to a secluded\r\nseat, where I sit in hours of contemplation enjoying nature. We will get\r\na magnificent view of the governor’s house, two striped sentry boxes,\r\nthree gendarmes, and not a single dog! Don’t be too much surprised at\r\nthe volubility of my remarks with which I am trying so hard to amuse\r\nyou. According to my friends, I am the representative of Russian wit...\r\nprobably that is why I am lame.”\r\n\r\nPaklin conducted the friends to the “secluded seat” and made them sit\r\ndown, after having first got rid of two beggar women installed on it.\r\nThen the young people proceeded to “exchange ideas,” a rather dull\r\noccupation mostly, particularly at the beginning, and a fruitless one\r\ngenerally.\r\n\r\n“Stop a moment!” Paklin exclaimed, turning to Nejdanov, “I must first\r\ntell you why I’ve come here. You know that I usually take my sister away\r\nsomewhere every summer, and when I heard that you were coming to this\r\nneighbourhood I remembered there were two wonderful creatures living in\r\nthis very town, husband and wife, distant relations of ours... on our\r\nmother’s side. My father came from the lower middle class and my mother\r\nwas of noble blood.” (Nejdanov knew this, but Paklin mentioned the fact\r\nfor the benefit of the others.) “These people have for a long time been\r\nasking us to come and see them. Why not? I thought. It’s just what I\r\nwant. They’re the kindest creatures and it will do my sister no end of\r\ngood. What could be better? And so here we are. And really I can’t\r\ntell you how jolly it is for us here! They’re such dears! Such original\r\ntypes! You must certainly get to know them! What are you doing here?\r\nWhere are you going to dine? And why did you come here of all places?”\r\n\r\n“We are going to dine with a certain Golushkin—a merchant here,”\r\n Nejdanov replied.\r\n\r\n“At what time?”\r\n\r\n“At three o’clock.”\r\n\r\n“Are you going to see him on account... on account—”\r\n\r\nPaklin looked at Solomin who was smiling and at Markelov who sat\r\nenveloped in his gloom.\r\n\r\n“Come, Aliosha, tell them—make some sort of Masonic sign ... tell them\r\nnot to be on ceremony with me ... I am one of you—of your party.”\r\n\r\n“Golushkin is also one of us,” Nejdanov observed.\r\n\r\n“Why, that’s splendid! It is still a long way off from three o’clock.\r\nSuppose we go and see my relatives!”\r\n\r\n“What an idea! How can we——”\r\n\r\n“Don’t be alarmed, I take all the responsibility upon myself. Imagine,\r\nit’s an oasis! Neither politics, literature, nor anything modern ever\r\npenetrates there. The little house is such a squat one, such as one\r\nrarely sees nowadays; the very smell in it is antique; the people\r\nantique, the air antique...whatever you touch is antique, Catherine\r\nII. powder, crinolines, eighteenth century! And the host and hostess...\r\nimagine a husband and wife both very old, of the same age, without a\r\nwrinkle, chubby, round, neat little people, just like two poll-parrots;\r\nand kind to stupidity, to saintliness, there is no end to their\r\nkindness! I am told that excessive kindness is often a sign of moral\r\nweakness.... I cannot enter into these subtleties, but I know that my\r\ndear old people are goodness itself. They never had any children, the\r\nblessed ones! That is what they call them here in the town; blessed\r\nones! They both dress alike, in a sort of loose striped gown, of such\r\ngood material, also a rarity, not to be found nowadays. They are\r\nexactly like one another, except that one wears a mob-cap, the other a\r\nskull-cap, which is trimmed with the same kind of frill, only without\r\nribbons. If it were not for these ribbons, you would not know one from\r\nthe other, as the husband is clean-shaven. One is called Fomishka, the\r\nother Fimishka. I tell you one ought to pay to go and look at them! They\r\nlove one another in the most impossible way; and if you ever go to see\r\nthem, they welcome you with open arms. And so gracious; they will show\r\noff all their little parlour tricks to amuse you. But there is only\r\none thing they can’t stand, and that is smoking, not because they are\r\nnonconformists, but because it doesn’t agree with them.... Of course,\r\nnobody smoked in their time. However, to make up for that, they don’t\r\nkeep canaries—this bird was also very little known in their day. I’m\r\nsure you’ll agree that that’s a comfort at any rate! Well? Will you\r\ncome?”\r\n\r\n“I really don’t know,” Nejdanov began.\r\n\r\n“Wait a moment! I forgot to tell you; their voices, too, are exactly\r\nalike; close your eyes and you can hardly tell which is speaking.\r\nFomishka, perhaps, speaks just a little more expressively. You are about\r\nto enter on a great undertaking, my dear friends; may be on a terrible\r\nconflict.... Why not, before plunging into the stormy deep, take a dip in\r\nto—”\r\n\r\n“Stagnant water,” Markelov put in.\r\n\r\n“Stagnant if you like, but not putrid. There are ponds in the steppes\r\nwhich never get putrid, although there is no stream flowing through\r\nthem, because they have springs at the bottom. My old people have their\r\nsprings flowing in the depths of their hearts, as pure and as fresh\r\nas can be. The question is this: do you want to see how people lived\r\na hundred or a hundred and fifty years ago? If so, then make haste and\r\nfollow me. Or soon the day, the hour will come—it’s bound to be the\r\nsame hour for them both—when my little parrots will be thrown off their\r\nlittle perches—and everything antique will end with them. The squat\r\nlittle house will tumble down and the place where it stood will be\r\novergrown with that which, according to my grandmother, always grows\r\nover the spot where man’s handiwork has been—that is, nettles, burdock,\r\nthistles, wormwood, and dock leaves. The very street will cease to\r\nbe—other people will come and never will they see anything like it\r\nagain, never, through all the long ages!”\r\n\r\n“Well,” Nejdanov exclaimed, “let us go at once!”\r\n\r\n“With the greatest of pleasure,” Solomin added. “That sort of thing is\r\nnot in my line, still it will be interesting, and if Mr. Paklin really\r\nthinks that we shall not be putting anyone out by our visit... then...\r\nwhy not—”\r\n\r\n“You may be at ease on that score!” Paklin exclaimed in his turn. “They\r\nwill be delighted to see you—and nothing more. You need not be on\r\nceremony. I told you—they were blessed ones. We will get them to sing\r\nto us! Will you come too, Mr. Markelov?”\r\n\r\nMarkelov shrugged his shoulders impatiently.\r\n\r\n“You can hardly leave me here alone! We may as well go, I suppose.” The\r\nyoung people rose from the seat.\r\n\r\n“What a forbidding individual that is you have with you,” Paklin\r\nwhispered to Nejdanov, indicating Markelov. “The very image of John the\r\nBaptist eating locusts... only locusts, without the honey! But the other\r\nis splendid!” he added, with a nod of the head in Solomin’s direction.\r\n“What a delightful smile he has! I’ve noticed that people smile like\r\nthat only when they are far above others, but without knowing it\r\nthemselves.”\r\n\r\n“Are there really such people?” Nejdanov asked.\r\n\r\n“They are scarce, but there are,” Paklin replied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\nFomishka and Fimishka, otherwise Foma Lavrentievitch and Efimia Pavlovna\r\nSubotchev, belonged to one of the oldest and purest branches of the\r\nRussian nobility, and were considered to be the oldest inhabitants in\r\nthe town of S. They married when very young and settled, a long time\r\nago, in the little wooden ancestral house at the very end of the town.\r\nTime seemed to have stood still for them, and nothing “modern” ever\r\ncrossed the boundaries of their “oasis.” Their means were not great,\r\nbut their peasants supplied them several times a year with all the live\r\nstock and provisions they needed, just as in the days of serfdom,\r\nand their bailiff appeared once a year with the rents and a couple of\r\nwoodcocks, supposed to have been shot in the master’s forests, of which,\r\nin reality, not a trace remained. They regaled him with tea at the\r\ndrawing-room door, made him a present of a sheep-skin cap, a pair of\r\ngreen leather mittens, and sent him away with a blessing.\r\n\r\nThe Subotchevs’ house was filled with domestics and menials just as\r\nin days gone by. The old man-servant Kalliopitch, clad in a jacket\r\nof extraordinarily stout cloth with a stand-up collar and small steel\r\nbuttons, announced, in a sing-song voice, “Dinner is on the table,”\r\n and stood dozing behind his mistress’s chair as in days of old. The\r\nsideboard was under his charge, and so were all the groceries and\r\npickles. To the question, had he not heard of the emancipation, he\r\ninvariably replied: “How can one take notice of every idle piece of\r\ngossip? To be sure the Turks were emancipated, but such a dreadful thing\r\nhad not happened to him, thank the Lord!” A girl, Pufka, was kept in the\r\nhouse for entertainment, and the old nurse Vassilievna used to come in\r\nduring dinner with a dark kerchief on her head, and would relate all\r\nthe news in her deep voice—about Napoleon, about the war of 1812, about\r\nAntichrist and white niggers—or else, her chin propped on her hand,\r\nwith a most woeful expression on her face, she would tell of a dream she\r\nhad had, explaining what it meant, or perhaps how she had last read her\r\nfortune at cards. The Subotchevs’ house was different from all other\r\nhouses in the town. It was built entirely of oak, with perfectly square\r\nwindows, the double casements for winter use were never removed all the\r\nyear round. It contained numerous little ante-rooms, garrets, closets,\r\nand box-rooms, little landings with balustrades, little statues on\r\ncarved wooden pillars, and all kinds of back passages and sculleries.\r\nThere was a hedge right in front and a garden at the back, in which\r\nthere was a perfect nest of out-buildings: store rooms and cold-store\r\nrooms, barns, cellars and ice-cellars; not that there were many goods\r\nstored in them—some of them, in fact, were in an extremely delapidated\r\ncondition—but they had been there in olden days and were consequently\r\nallowed to remain.\r\n\r\nThe Subotchevs had only two ancient shaggy saddle horses, one of which,\r\ncalled the Immovable, had turned grey from old age. They were harnessed\r\nseveral times a month to an extraordinary carriage, known to the whole\r\ntown, which bore a faint resemblance to a terrestrial globe with a\r\nquarter of it cut away in front, and was upholstered inside with some\r\nforeign, yellowish stuff, covered with a pattern of huge dots, looking\r\nfor all the world like warts. The last yard of this stuff must have\r\nbeen woven in Utrecht or Lyons in the time of the Empress Elisabeth!\r\nThe Subotchev’s coachman, too, was old—an ancient, ancient old man with\r\na constant smell of tar and cart-oil about him. His beard began just\r\nbelow the eyes, while the eyebrows fell in little cascades to meet it.\r\nHe was called Perfishka, and was extremely slow in his movements. It\r\ntook him at least five minutes to take a pinch of snuff, two minutes\r\nto fasten the whip in his girdle, and two whole hours to harness the\r\nImmovable alone. If when out driving in their carriage the Subotchevs\r\nwere ever compelled to go the least bit up or down hill, they would\r\nbecome quite terrified, would cling to the straps, and both cry aloud,\r\n“Oh Lord ... give ... the horses ... the horses ... the strength of\r\nSamson ... and make us ... as light as a feather!”\r\n\r\nThe Subotchevs were regarded by everyone in the town as very eccentric,\r\nalmost mad, and indeed they too felt that they were not in keeping with\r\nmodern times. This, however, did not grieve them very much, and they\r\nquietly continued to follow the manner of life in which they had been\r\nborn and bred and married. One custom of that time, however, did not\r\ncling to them; from their earliest childhood they had never punished\r\nany of their servants. If one of them turned out to be a thief or a\r\ndrunkard, then they bore with him for a long time, as one bears with bad\r\nweather, and when their patience was quite exhausted they would get rid\r\nof him by passing him on to someone else. “Let others bear with him\r\na little,” they would say. But any such misfortune rarely happened to\r\nthem, so rarely that it became an epoch in their lives. They would\r\nsay, for instance, “Oh, it was long ago; it happened when we had that\r\nimpudent Aldoshka with us,” or “When grandfather’s fur cap with\r\nthe fox’s tail was stolen!” Such caps were still to be found at the\r\nSubotchevs’. Another distinguishing characteristic of the old world\r\nwas missing in them; neither Fomishka nor Fimishka were very religious.\r\nFomishka was even a follower of Voltaire, while Fimishka had a mortal\r\ndread of the clergy and believed them to be possessed of the evil eye.\r\n“As soon as a priest comes into my house the cream turns sour!” she used\r\nto say. They rarely went to church and fasted in the Catholic fashion,\r\nthat is, ate eggs, butter, and milk. This was known in the town and did\r\nnot, of course, add to their reputation. But their kindness conquered\r\neverybody; and although the Subotchevs were laughed at and called cranks\r\nand blessed ones, still they were respected by everyone. No one cared\r\nto visit them, however, but they were little concerned about this, too.\r\nThey were never dull when in each other’s company, were never apart, and\r\nnever desired any other society.\r\n\r\nNeither Fomishka nor Fimishka had ever been ill, and if one or the\r\nother ever felt the slightest indisposition they would both drink some\r\nconcoction made of lime-flower, rub warm oil on their stomachs, or drop\r\nhot candle grease on the soles of their feet and the little ailment\r\nwould soon pass over. They spent their days exactly alike. They got up\r\nlate, drank chocolate in tiny cups shaped like small mortars (tea, they\r\ndeclared, came into fashion after their time), and sat opposite\r\none another chatting (they were never at a loss for a subject of\r\nconversation!), or read out of “Pleasant Recreations”, “The World’s\r\nMirror”, or “Aonides”, or turned over the leaves of an old album, bound\r\nin red morocco, with gilt edges. This album had once belonged, as the\r\ninscription showed, to a certain Madame Barbe de Kabyline. How and\r\nwhy it had come into their possession they did not know. It contained\r\nseveral French and a great many Russian poems and prose extracts, of\r\nwhich the following reflections on Cicero form a fair example—“The\r\ndisposition in which Cicero undertook the office of quaestor may be\r\ngathered from the following: Calling upon the gods to testify to the\r\npurity of his sentiments in every rank with which he had hitherto been\r\nhonoured, he considered himself bound by the most sacred bonds to the\r\nfulfilment of this one, and denied himself the indulgence, not only of\r\nsuch pleasures as are forbidden by law, but refrained even from such\r\nlight amusements which are considered indispensable by all.” Below\r\nwas written, “Composed in Siberia in hunger and cold.” An equally good\r\nspecimen was a poem entitled “Tirsis”, which ran like this—\r\n\r\nThe universe is steeped in calm, The delightful sparkling dew Soothing\r\nnature like a balm Gives to her, her life anew. Tersis alone with aching\r\nheart, Is torn by sadness and dismay, When dear Aneta doth depart What\r\nis there to make him gay?\r\n\r\nAnd the impromptu composition of a certain captain who had visited the\r\nplace in the year 1790, dated May 6th—\r\n\r\nN’er shall I forget thee, Village that to love I’ve grown, But I ever\r\nshall regret thee And the hours so quickly flown, Hours which I was\r\nhonoured in Spending with your owner’s kin, The five dearest days of my\r\nlife will hold Passed amongst most worthy people, Merry ladies, young\r\nand old, And other interesting people.\r\n\r\nOn the last page of the album, instead of verses, there were various\r\nrecipes for remedies against stomach troubles, spasms, and worms. The\r\nSubotchevs dined exactly at twelve o’clock and only ate old-fashioned\r\ndishes: curd fritters, pickled cabbage, soups, fruit jellies, minced\r\nchicken with saffron, stews, custards, and honey. They took an\r\nafter-dinner nap for an hour, not longer, and on waking up would sit\r\nopposite one another again, drinking bilberry wine or an effervescent\r\ndrink called “forty-minds,” which nearly always squirted out of\r\nthe bottle, affording them great amusement, much to the disgust of\r\nKalliopitch, who had to wipe up the mess afterwards. He grumbled at\r\nthe cook and housekeeper as if they had invented this dreadful drink on\r\npurpose. “What pleasure does it give one?” he asked; “it only spoils the\r\nfurniture.” Then the old people again read something, or got the dwarf\r\nPufka to entertain them, or sang old-fashioned duets. Their voices\r\nwere exactly alike, rather high-pitched, not very strong or steady, and\r\nsomewhat husky, especially after their nap, but not without a certain\r\namount of charm. Or, if need be, they played at cards, always the same\r\nold games—cribbage, écarté, or double-dummy whist. Then the samovar\r\nmade its appearance. The only concession they made to the spirit of the\r\nage was to drink tea in the evening, though they always considered it an\r\nindulgence, and were convinced that the nation was deteriorating, owing\r\nto the use of this “Chinese herb.” On the whole, they refrained from\r\ncriticising modern times or from exulting their own. They had lived like\r\nthis all their lives, but that others might live in a different and even\r\nbetter way they were quite willing to admit, so long as they were not\r\ncompelled to conform to it. At seven o’clock Kalliopitch produced the\r\ninevitable supper of cold hash, and at nine the high striped feather-bed\r\nreceived their rotund little bodies in its soft embrace, and a calm,\r\nuntroubled sleep soon descended upon their eyelids. Everything in the\r\nlittle house became hushed; the little lamp before the icon glowed and\r\nglimmered, the funny innocent little pair slept the sound sleep of the\r\njust, amidst the fragrant scent of musk and the chirping of the cricket.\r\n\r\nTo these two odd little people, or poll-parrots as Paklin called them,\r\nwho were taking care of his sister, he now conducted his friends.\r\n\r\nPaklin’s sister was a clever girl with a fairly attractive face. She had\r\nwonderfully beautiful eyes, but her unfortunate deformity had completely\r\nbroken her spirit, deprived her of self-confidence, joyousness, made her\r\nmistrustful and even spiteful. She had been given the unfortunate name\r\nof Snandulia, and to Paklin’s request that she should be re-christened\r\nSophia, she replied that it was just as it should be; a hunchback ought\r\nto be called Snandulia; so she stuck to her strange name. She was an\r\nexcellent musician and played the piano very well. “Thanks to my long\r\nfingers,” she would say, not without a touch of bitterness. “Hunchbacks\r\nalways have fingers like that.”\r\n\r\nThe visitors came upon Fomishka and Fimishka at the very minute when\r\nthey had awakened from their afternoon nap and were drinking bilberry\r\nwine.\r\n\r\n“We are going into the eighteenth century!” Paklin exclaimed as they\r\ncrossed the threshold of the Subotchevs’ house.\r\n\r\nAnd really they were confronted by the eighteenth century in the very\r\nhall, with its low bluish screens, ornamented with black silhouettes\r\ncut out of paper, of powdered ladies and gentlemen. Silhouettes, first\r\nintroduced by Lavater, were much in vogue in the eighties of last\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe sudden appearance of such a large number of guests—four all at\r\nonce—produced quite a sensation in the usually quiet house. A hurried\r\nsound of feet, both shod and unshod, was heard, several women thrust\r\ntheir heads through the door and instantly drew them back again,\r\nsomeone was pushed, another groaned, a third giggled, someone whispered\r\nexcitedly, “Be quiet, do!”\r\n\r\nAt last Kalliopitch made his appearance in his old coat, and opening the\r\ndrawing-room door announced in a loud voice:\r\n\r\n“Sila Samsonitch with some other gentlemen, sir!”\r\n\r\nThe Subotchevs were less disturbed than their servants, although the\r\neruption of four full-sized men into their drawing-room, spacious though\r\nit was, did in fact surprise them somewhat. But Paklin soon reassured\r\nthem, introducing Nejdanov, Solomin, and Markelov in turn, as good quiet\r\npeople, not “governmental.”\r\n\r\nFomishka and Fimishka had a horror of governmental, that is to say,\r\nofficial people.\r\n\r\nSnandulia, who appeared at her brother’s request, was far more disturbed\r\nand agitated than the old couple.\r\n\r\nThey asked, both together and in exactly the same words, if their guests\r\nwould be pleased to partake of some tea, chocolate, or an effervescent\r\ndrink with jam, but learning that they did not require anything, having\r\njust lunched with the merchant Golushkin and that they were returning\r\nthere to dinner, they ceased pressing them, and, folding their arms\r\nin exactly the same manner across their stomachs, they entered into\r\nconversation. It was a little slow at first, but soon grew livelier.\r\n\r\nPaklin amused them very much by relating the well known Gogol anecdote\r\nabout a superintendent of police, who managed to push his way into a\r\nchurch already so packed with people that a pin could scarcely drop,\r\nand about a pie which turned out to be no other than this same\r\nsuperintendent himself. The old people laughed till the tears rolled\r\ndown their cheeks. They had exactly the same shrill laugh and both\r\nwent red in the face from the effort. Paklin noticed that people of the\r\nSubotchev type usually went into fits of laughter over quotations\r\nfrom Gogol, but as his object at the present moment was not so much\r\nin amusing them as in showing them off to his friends, he changed his\r\ntactics and soon managed to put them in an excellent humour.\r\n\r\nFomishka produced a very ancient carved wooden snuff-box and showed it\r\nto the visitors with great pride. At one time one could have discerned\r\nabout thirty-six little human figures in various attitudes carved on its\r\nlid, but they were so erased as to be scarcely visible now. Fomishka,\r\nhowever, still saw them and could even count them. He would point to one\r\nand say, “Just look! this one is staring out of the window.... He has\r\nthrust his head out!” but the place indicated by his fat little finger\r\nwith the nail raised was just as smooth as the rest of the box. He then\r\nturned their attention to an oil painting hanging on the wall just above\r\nhis head. It represented a hunter in profile, galloping at full speed on\r\na bay horse, also in profile, over a snow plain. The hunter was clad in\r\na tall white sheepskin hat with a pale blue point, a tunic of\r\ncamel’s hair edged with velvet, and a girdle wrought in gold. A glove\r\nembroidered in silk was gracefully tucked into the girdle, and a dagger\r\nchased in black and silver hung at the side. In one hand the plump,\r\nyouthful hunter carried an enormous horn, ornamented with red tassels,\r\nand the reins and whip in the other. The horse’s four legs were all\r\nsuspended in the air, and on every one of them the artist had carefully\r\npainted a horseshoe and even indicated the nails. “Look,” Fomishka\r\nobserved, pointing with the same fat little finger to four semi-circular\r\nspots on the white ground, close to the horse’s legs, “he has even put\r\nthe snow prints in!” Why there were only four of these prints and not\r\nany to be seen further back, on this point Fomishka was silent.\r\n\r\n“This was I!” he added after a pause, with a modest smile.\r\n\r\n“Really!” Nejdanov exclaimed, “were you ever a hunting man?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. I was for a time. Once the horse threw me at full gallop and I\r\ninjured my _kurpey_. Fimishka got frightened and forbade me; so I have\r\ngiven it up since then.”\r\n\r\n“What did you injure?” Nejdanov asked.\r\n\r\n“My _kurpey_,” Fomishka repeated, lowering his voice.\r\n\r\nThe visitors looked at one another. No one knew what _kurpey_ meant; at\r\nleast, Markelov knew that the tassel on a Cossack or Circassian cap was\r\ncalled a _kurpey_, but then how could Fomishka have injured that? But\r\nno one dared to question him further.\r\n\r\n“Well, now that you have shown off,” Fimishka remarked suddenly, “I\r\nwill show off too.” And going up to a small _bonheur du jour_, as they\r\nused to call an old-fashioned bureau, on tiny, crooked legs, with a\r\nround lid which fitted into the back of it somewhere when opened, she\r\ntook out a miniature in water colour, in an oval bronze frame, of a\r\nperfectly naked little child of four years old with a quiver over her\r\nshoulders fastened across the chest with pale blue ribbons, trying the\r\npoints of the arrows with the tip of her little finger. The child was\r\nall smiles and curls and had a slight squint.\r\n\r\n“And that was I,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Really?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, as a child. When my father was alive a Frenchman used to come\r\nand see him, such a nice Frenchman too! He painted that for my father’s\r\nbirthday. Such a nice man! He used to come and see us often. He would\r\ncome in, make such a pretty courtesy and kiss your hand, and when going\r\naway would kiss the tips of his own fingers so prettily, and bow to\r\nthe right, to the left, backwards and forwards! He was such a nice\r\nFrenchman!”\r\n\r\nThe guests praised his work; Paklin even declared that he saw a certain\r\nlikeness.\r\n\r\nHere Fomishka began to express his views on the modern French, saying\r\nthat they had become very wicked nowadays!\r\n\r\n“What makes you think so, Foma Lavrentievitch?”\r\n\r\n“Look at the awful names they give themselves nowadays!”\r\n\r\n“What, for instance?”\r\n\r\n“Nogent Saint Lorraine, for instance! A regular brigand’s name!”\r\n\r\nFomishka asked incidentally who reigned in Paris now, and when told that\r\nit was Napoleon, was surprised and pained at the information.\r\n\r\n“How?... Such an old man—” he began and stopped, looking round in\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\nFomishka had but a poor knowledge of French, and read Voltaire in\r\ntranslation; he always kept a translated manuscript of “Candide” in the\r\nbible box at the head of his bed. He used to come out with expressions\r\nlike: “This, my dear, is _fausse parquet_,” meaning suspicious, untrue.\r\nHe was very much laughed at for this, until a certain learned Frenchman\r\ntold him that it was an old parliamentary expression employed in his\r\ncountry until the year 1789.\r\n\r\nAs the conversation turned upon France and the French, Fimishka resolved\r\nto ask something that had been very much on her mind. She first thought\r\nof addressing herself to Markelov, but he looked too forbidding, so she\r\nturned to Solomin, but no! He seemed to her such a plain sort of person,\r\nnot likely to know French at all, so she turned to Nejdanov.\r\n\r\n“I should like to ask you something, if I may,” she began; “excuse me,\r\nmy kinsman Sila Samsonitch makes fun of me and my woman’s ignorance.”\r\n\r\n“What is it?”\r\n\r\n“Supposing one wants to ask in French, ‘What is it?’ must one say\r\n‘Kese-kese-kese-la?’”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“And can one also say ‘Kese-kese-la?’”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“And simply ‘Kese-la?’”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that’s right.”\r\n\r\n“And does it mean the same thing?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, it does.”\r\n\r\nFimishka thought awhile, then threw up her arms.\r\n\r\n“Well, Silushka,” she exclaimed; “I am wrong and you are right. But\r\nthese Frenchmen.... How smart they are!”\r\n\r\nPaklin began begging the old people to sing them some ballad. They\r\nwere both surprised and amused at the idea, but consented readily on\r\ncondition that Snandulia accompanied them on the harpsichord. In a\r\ncorner of the room there stood a little spinet, which not one of them\r\nhad noticed before. Snandulia sat down to it and struck several chords.\r\nNejdanov had never heard such sour, toneless, tingling, jangling notes,\r\nbut the old people promptly struck up the ballad, “Was it to Mourn.”\r\n\r\nFomisha began—\r\n\r\n    “In love God gave a heart\r\n     Of burning passion to inspire\r\n     That loving heart with warm desire.”\r\n\r\n    “But there is agony in bliss”\r\n\r\nFimishka chimed in.\r\n\r\n    “And passion free from pain there is,\r\n     Ah! where, where? tell me, tell me this,”\r\n\r\n    “Ah! where, where? Tell me, tell me this,”\r\n\r\nFomisha put in.\r\n\r\n    “Ah! where, where? tell me, tell me this,”\r\n\r\nFimishka repeated.\r\n\r\n    “Nowhere in all the world, nowhere,\r\n     Love bringeth grief and black despair,”\r\n\r\nthey sang together,\r\n\r\n    “And that, love’s gift is everywhere,”\r\n\r\nFomisha sang out alone.\r\n\r\n“Bravo!” Paklin exclaimed. “We have had the first verse, now please sing\r\nus the second.”\r\n\r\n“With the greatest of pleasure,” Fomishka said, “but what about the\r\ntrill, Snandulia Samsonovna? After my verse there must be a trill.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, I will play your trill,” Snandulia replied. Fomishka began\r\nagain—\r\n\r\n    “Has ever lover lovéd true\r\n     And kept his heart from grief and rue?\r\n     He loveth but to weep anew”\r\n\r\nand then Fimishka—\r\n\r\n    “Yea—hearts that love at last are riven\r\n     As ships that hopelessly have striven\r\n     For life. To what end were they given?”\r\n\r\n“To what end were they given?”\r\n\r\nFomishka warbled out and waited for Snandulia to play the trill.\r\n\r\n    “To what end were they given?”\r\n\r\nhe repeated, and then they struck up together—\r\n\r\n    “Then take, Oh God, the heart away,\r\n     Away, away, take hearts away,\r\n     Away, away, away today.”\r\n\r\n“Bravo! Bravo!” the company exclaimed, all with exception of Markelov.\r\n\r\n“I wonder they don’t feel like clowns?” Nejdanov thought. “Perhaps they\r\ndo, who knows? They no doubt think there is no harm in it and may be\r\neven amusing to some people. If one looks at it in that light, they are\r\nquite right! A thousand times right!”\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of these reflections he began paying compliments to\r\nthe host and hostess, which they acknowledged with a courtesy, performed\r\nwhile sitting in their chairs. At this moment Pufka the dwarf and Nurse\r\nVassilievna made their appearance from the adjoining room (a bedroom or\r\nperhaps the maids’ room) from whence a great bustle and whispering had\r\nbeen going on for some time. Pufka began squealing and making hideous\r\ngrimaces, while the nurse first quietened her, then egged her on.\r\n\r\nSolomin’s habitual smile became even broader, while Markelov, who had\r\nbeen for some time showing signs of impatience, suddenly turned to\r\nFomishka:\r\n\r\n“I did not expect that you,” he began in his severe manner, “with your\r\nenlightened mind—I’ve heard that you are a follower of Voltaire—could\r\nbe amused with what ought to be an object for compassion—with\r\ndeformity!” Here he remembered Paklin’s sister and could have bitten his\r\ntongue off.\r\n\r\nFomishka went red in the face and muttered: “You see ... it is not my\r\nfault ... she herself——”\r\n\r\nPufka simply flew at Markelov.\r\n\r\n“How dare you insult our masters?” she screamed out in her lisping\r\nvoice. “What is it to you that they took me in, brought me up, and gave\r\nme meat and drink? Can’t you bear to see another’s good fortune, eh?\r\nWho asked you to come here? You fusty, musty, black-faced villain with\r\na moustache like a beetle’s!” Here Pufka indicated with her thick short\r\nfingers what his moustache was like; while Nurse Vassilievna’s toothless\r\nmouth was convulsed with laughter, re-echoed in the adjoining room.\r\n\r\n“I am not in a position to judge you,” Markelov went on. “To protect the\r\nhomeless and deformed is a very praiseworthy work, but I must say that\r\nto live in ease and luxury, even though without injury to others, not\r\nlifting a finger to help a fellow-creature, does not require a great\r\ndeal of goodness. I, for one, do not attach much importance to that sort\r\nof virtue!”\r\n\r\nHere Pufka gave forth a deafening howl. She did not understand a word of\r\nwhat Markelov had said, but she felt that the “black one” was scolding,\r\nand how dared he! Vassilievna also muttered something, while Fomishka\r\nfolded his hands across his breast and turned to his wife. “Fimishka, my\r\ndarling,” he began, almost in tears; “do you hear what the gentleman is\r\nsaying? We are both wicked sinners, Pharisees.... We are living on\r\nthe fat of the land, oh! oh! oh! We ought to be turned out into the\r\nstreet... with a broom in our hands to work for our living! Oh! oh!”\r\n\r\nAt these mournful words Pufka howled louder than ever, while Fimishka\r\nscrewed up her eyes, opened her lips, drew in a deep breath, ready to\r\nretaliate, to speak.\r\n\r\nGod knows how it would have ended had not Paklin intervened.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter?” he began, gesticulating with his hands and\r\nlaughing loudly. “I wonder you are not ashamed of yourselves! Mr.\r\nMarkelov only meant it as a joke. He has such a solemn face that it\r\nsounded a little severe and you took him seriously! Calm yourself!\r\nEfimia Pavlovna, darling, we are just going, won’t you tell us our\r\nfortunes at cards? You are such a good hand at it. Snandulia, do get the\r\ncards, please!”\r\n\r\nFimishka glanced at her husband, who seemed completely reassured, so she\r\ntoo quieted down.\r\n\r\n“I have quite forgotten how to tell fortunes, my dear. It is such a long\r\ntime since I held the cards in my hand.”\r\n\r\nBut quite of her own accord she took an extraordinary, ancient pack of\r\ncards out of Snandalia’s hand.\r\n\r\n“Whose fortune shall I tell?”\r\n\r\n“Why everybody’s, of course!” Paklin exclaimed. “What a dear old thing\r\nshe is.... You can do what you like with her,” he thought. “Tell us\r\nall our fortunes, granny dear,” he said aloud. “Tell us our fates, our\r\ncharacters, our futures, everything!”\r\n\r\nShe began shuffling the cards, but threw them down suddenly.\r\n\r\n“I don’t need cards!” she exclaimed. “I know all your characters\r\nwithout that, and as the character, so is the fate. This one,” she said,\r\npointing to Solomin, “is a cool, steady sort of man. That one,” she\r\nsaid, pointing threateningly at Markelov, “is a fiery, disastrous man.”\r\n (Pufka put her tongue out at him.) “And as for you,” she looked at\r\nPaklin, “there is no need to tell you—you know quite well that you’re\r\nnothing but a giddy goose! And that one—”\r\n\r\nShe pointed to Nejdanov, but hesitated.\r\n\r\n“Well?” he asked; “do please tell me what sort of a man I am.”\r\n\r\n“What sort of a man are you,” Fimishka repeated slowly. “You are\r\npitiable—that is all!”\r\n\r\n“Pitiable! But why?”\r\n\r\n“Just so. I pity you—that is all I can say.”\r\n\r\n“But why do you pity me?”\r\n\r\n“Because my eyes tell me so. Do you think I am a fool? I am cleverer\r\nthan you, in spite of your red hair. I pity you—that is all!”\r\n\r\nThere was a brief silence—they all looked at one another, but did not\r\nutter a word.\r\n\r\n“Well, goodbye, dear friends,” Paklin exclaimed. “We must have bored\r\nyou to death with our long visit. It is time for these gentlemen to be\r\ngoing, and I am going with them. Goodbye, thanks for your kindness.”\r\n\r\n“Goodbye, goodbye, come again. Don’t be on ceremony,” Fomishka and\r\nFimishka exclaimed together. Then Fomishka suddenly drawled out:\r\n\r\n“Many, many, many years of life. Many—”\r\n\r\n“Many, many,” Kalliopitch chimed in quite unexpectedly, when opening the\r\ndoor for the young men to pass out.\r\n\r\nThe whole four suddenly found themselves in the street before the squat\r\nlittle house, while Pufka’s voice was heard from within:\r\n\r\n“You fools!” she cried. “You fools!”\r\n\r\nPaklin laughed aloud, but no one responded. Markelov looked at each\r\nin turn, as though he expected to hear some expression of indignation.\r\nSolomin alone smiled his habitual smile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\n“Well,” Paklin was the first to begin, “we have been to the eighteenth\r\ncentury, now let us fly to the twentieth! Golushkin is such a go-ahead\r\nman that one can hardly count him as belonging to the nineteenth.”\r\n\r\n“Why, do you know him?”\r\n\r\n“What a question! Did you know my poll-parrots?”\r\n\r\n“No, but you introduced us.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, introduce me. I don’t suppose you have any secrets to\r\ntalk over, and Golushkin is a hospitable man. You will see; he will be\r\ndelighted to see a new face. We are not very formal here in S.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” Markelov muttered, “I have certainly noticed an absence of\r\nformality about the people here.”\r\n\r\nPaklin shook his head.\r\n\r\n“I suppose that was a hit for me... I can’t help it ... I deserve it, no\r\ndoubt. But may I suggest, my new friend, that you throw off those sad,\r\noppressive thoughts, no doubt due to your bilious temperament... and\r\nchiefly—”\r\n\r\n“And you sir, my new friend,” Markelov interrupted him angrily, “allow\r\nme to tell you, by way of a warning, that I have never in my life been\r\ngiven to joking, least of all today! And what do you know about my\r\ntemperament, I should like to know? It strikes me that it is not so very\r\nlong since we first set eyes on one another.”\r\n\r\n“There, there, don’t get angry and don’t swear. I believe you without\r\nthat,” Paklin exclaimed. “Oh you,” he said, turning to Solomin, “you,\r\nwhom the wise Fimishka called a cool sort of man, and there certainly is\r\nsomething restful about you—do you think I had the slightest intention\r\nof saying anything unpleasant to anyone or of joking out of place?\r\nI only suggested going with you to Golushkin’s. Besides, I’m such a\r\nharmless person; it’s not my fault that Mr. Markelov has a bilious\r\ncomplexion.”\r\n\r\nSolomin first shrugged one shoulder, then the other. It was a habit of\r\nhis when he did not quite know what to say.\r\n\r\n“I don’t think,” he said at last, “that you could offend anyone, Mr.\r\nPaklin, or that you wished to—and why should you not come with us\r\nto Mr. Golushkin? We shall, no doubt, spend our time there just as\r\npleasantly as we did at your kinsman’s—and just as profitably most\r\nlikely.”\r\n\r\nPaklin threatened him with his finger.\r\n\r\n“Oh! I see, you can be wicked too if you like! However, you are also\r\ncoming to Golushkin’s, are you not?”\r\n\r\n“Of course I am. I have wasted the day as it is.”\r\n\r\n“Well then, _en avant, marchons_! To the twentieth century! To the\r\ntwentieth century! Nejdanov, you are an advanced man, lead the way!”\r\n\r\n“Very well, come along; only don’t keep on repeating the same jokes lest\r\nwe should think you are running short.”\r\n\r\n“I have still enough left for you, my dear friends,” Paklin said gaily\r\nand went on ahead, not by leaping, but by limping, as he said.\r\n\r\n“What an amusing man!” Solomin remarked as he was walking along\r\narm-in-arm with Nejdanov; “if we should ever be sent to Siberia, which\r\nHeaven forbid, there will be someone to entertain us at any rate.”\r\n\r\nMarkelov walked in silence behind the others.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile great preparations were going on at Golushkin’s to produce\r\na “chic” dinner. (Golushkin, as a man of the highest European culture,\r\nkept a French cook, who had formerly been dismissed from a club for\r\ndirtiness.) A nasty, greasy fish soup was prepared, various _pâtés chauds_\r\nand fricassés and, most important of all, several bottles of champagne\r\nhad been procured and put into ice.\r\n\r\nThe host met the young people with his characteristic awkwardness,\r\nbustle, and much giggling. He was delighted to see Paklin as the latter\r\nhad predicted and asked of him, “Is he one of us? Of course he is! I\r\nneed not have asked,” he said, without waiting for a reply. He began\r\ntelling them how he had just come from that “old fogey” the governor,\r\nand how the latter worried him to death about some sort of charity\r\ninstitution. It was difficult to say what satisfied Golushkin most, the\r\nfact that he was received at the governor’s, or that he was able to\r\nabuse that worthy before these advanced, young men. Then he introduced\r\nthem to the promised proselyte, who turned out to be no other than the\r\nsleek consumptive individual with the long neck whom they had seen\r\nin the morning, Vasia, Golushkin’s clerk. “He hasn’t much to say,”\r\nGolushkin declared, “but is devoted heart and soul to our cause.” To\r\nthis Vasia bowed, blushed, blinked his eyes, and grinned in such a\r\nmanner that it was impossible to say whether he was merely a vulgar\r\nfool or an out-and-out knave and blackguard.\r\n\r\n“Well, gentlemen, let us go to dinner,” Golushkin exclaimed.\r\n\r\nThey partook of various kinds of salt fish to give them an appetite and\r\nsat down to the table. Directly after the soup, Golushkin ordered the\r\nchampagne to be brought up, which came out in frozen little lumps as\r\nhe poured it into the glasses. “For our ... our enterprise!” Golushkin\r\nexclaimed, winking at the servant, as much as to say, “One must be\r\ncareful in the presence of strangers.” The proselyte Vasia continued\r\nsilent, and though he sat on the very edge of his chair and conducted\r\nhimself generally with a servility quite out of keeping with the\r\nconvictions to which, according to his master, he was devoted body and\r\nsoul, yet gulped down the wine with an amazing greediness. The others\r\nmade up for his silence, however, that is, Golushkin and Paklin,\r\nespecially Paklin. Nejdanov was inwardly annoyed, Markelov angry and\r\nindignant, just as indignant, though in a different way, as he had been\r\nat the Subotchevs’; Solomin was observant.\r\n\r\nPaklin was in high spirits and delighted Golushkin with his sharp,\r\nready wit. The latter had not the slightest suspicion that the “little\r\ncripple” every now and again whispered to Nejdanov, who happened to be\r\nsitting beside him, the most unflattering remarks at his, Golushkin’s,\r\nexpense. He thought him “a simple sort of fellow” who might be\r\npatronised; that was probably why he liked him. Had Paklin been sitting\r\nnext him he would no doubt have poked him in the ribs or slapped him on\r\nthe shoulder, but as it was, he merely contented himself by nodding and\r\nwinking in his direction. Between him and Nejdanov sat Markelov, like a\r\ndark cloud, and then Solomin. Golushkin went into convulsions at every\r\nword Paklin said, laughed on trust in advance, holding his sides and\r\nshowing his bluish gums. Paklin soon saw what was expected of him and\r\nbegan abusing everything (it being an easy thing for him), everything\r\nand everybody; conservatives, liberals, officials, lawyers,\r\nadministrators, landlords, county councils and district councils, Moscow\r\nand St. Petersburg. “Yes, yes, yes,” Golushkin put in, “that’s just\r\nhow it is! For instance, our mayor here is a perfect ass! A hopeless\r\nblockhead! I tell him one thing after another, but he doesn’t understand\r\na single word; just like our governor!”\r\n\r\n“Is your governor a fool then?” Paklin asked.\r\n\r\n“I told you he was an ass!”\r\n\r\n“By the way, does he speak in a hoarse voice or through his nose?”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” Golushkin asked somewhat bewildered.\r\n\r\n“Why, don’t you know? In Russia all our important civilians speak in\r\na hoarse voice and our great army men speak through the nose. Only our\r\nvery highest dignitaries do both at the same time.”\r\n\r\nGolushkin roared with laughter till the tears rolled down his cheeks.\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes,” he spluttered, “if he talks through his nose ... then he’s\r\nan army man!”\r\n\r\n“You idiot!” Paklin thought to himself.\r\n\r\n“Everything is rotten in this country, wherever you may turn!” he bawled\r\nout after a pause. “Everything is rotten, everything!”\r\n\r\n“My dear Kapiton Andraitch,” Paklin began suggestively (he had just\r\nasked Nejdanov in an undertone, “Why does he throw his arms about as if\r\nhis coat were too tight for him?”), “my dear Kapiton Andraitch, believe\r\nme, half measures are of no use!”\r\n\r\n“Who talks of half measures!” Golushkin shouted furiously (he had\r\nsuddenly ceased laughing), “there’s only one thing to be done; it must\r\nall be pulled up by the roots: Vasia, drink!”\r\n\r\n“I am drinking, Kapiton Andraitch,” the clerk observed, emptying a glass\r\ndown his throat.\r\n\r\nGolushkin followed his suit.\r\n\r\n“I wonder he doesn’t burst!” Paklin whispered to Nejdanov.\r\n\r\n“He’s used to it!” the latter replied.\r\n\r\nBut the clerk was not the only one who drank. Little by little the wine\r\naffected them all. Nejdanov, Markelov, and even Solomin began taking\r\npart in the conversation.\r\n\r\nAt first disdainfully, as if annoyed with himself for doing so, for not\r\nkeeping up his character, Nejdanov began to hold forth. He maintained\r\nthat the time had now come to leave off playing with words; that the\r\ntime had come for “action,” that they were now on sure ground! And\r\nthen, quite unconscious of the fact that he was contradicting himself,\r\nhe began to demand of them to show him what real existing elements they\r\nhad to rely on, saying that as far as he could see society was utterly\r\nunsympathetic towards them, and the people were as ignorant as could be.\r\nNobody made any objection to what he said, not because there was nothing\r\nto object to, but because everyone was talking on his own account.\r\nMarkelov hammered out obstinately in his hoarse, angry, monotonous voice\r\n(“just as if he were chopping cabbage,” Paklin remarked). Precisely what\r\nhe was talking about no one could make out, but the word “artillery”\r\n could be heard in a momentary hush. He was no doubt referring to the\r\ndefects he had discovered in its organisation. Germans and adjutants\r\nwere also brought in. Solomin remarked that there were two ways of\r\nwaiting, waiting and doing nothing and waiting while pushing things\r\nahead at the same time.\r\n\r\n“We don’t want moderates,” Markelov said angrily.\r\n\r\n“The moderates have so far been working among the upper classes,”\r\n Solomin remarked, “and we must go for the lower.”\r\n\r\n“We don’t want it! damnation! We don’t want it!” Golushkin bawled out\r\nfuriously. “We must do everything with one blow! With one blow, I say!”\r\n\r\n“What is the use of extreme measures? It’s like jumping out of the\r\nwindow.”\r\n\r\n“And I’ll jump too, if necessary!” Golushkin shouted. “I’ll jump! and\r\nso will Vasia! I’ve only to tell him and he’ll jump! eh, Vasia? You’ll\r\njump, eh?”\r\n\r\nThe clerk finished his glass of champagne.\r\n\r\n“Where you go, Kapiton Andraitch, there I follow. I shouldn’t dare do\r\notherwise.”\r\n\r\n“You had better not, or I’ll make mincemeat of you!”\r\n\r\nSoon a perfect babel followed.\r\n\r\nLike the first flakes of snow whirling round and round in the mild\r\nautumn air, so words began flying in all directions in Golushkin’s hot,\r\nstuffy dining-room; all kinds of words, rolling and tumbling over one\r\nanother: progress, government, literature, the taxation question, the\r\nchurch question, the woman question; the law-court question, realism,\r\nnihilism, communism, international, clerical, liberal, capital,\r\nadministration, organisation, association, and even crystallisation!\r\nIt was just what Golushkin wanted; this uproar seemed to him the real\r\nthing. He was triumphant. “Look at us! out of the way or I’ll knock\r\nyou on the head! Kapiton Golushkin is coming!” At last the clerk Vasia\r\nbecame so tipsy that he began to giggle and talk to his plate. All\r\nat once he jumped up shouting wildly, “What sort of devil is this\r\n_pro_gymnasium?”\r\n\r\nGolushkin sprang up too, and throwing back his hot, flushed face, on\r\nwhich an expression of vulgar self-satisfaction was curiously mingled\r\nwith a feeling of terror, a secret misgiving, he bawled out, “I’ll\r\nsacrifice another thousand! Get it for me, Vasia!” To which Vasia\r\nreplied, “All right!”\r\n\r\nJust then Paklin, pale and perspiring (he had been drinking no less than\r\nthe clerk during the last quarter of an hour), jumped up from his seat\r\nand, waving both his arms above his head, shouted brokenly, “Sacrifice!\r\nSacrifice! What pollution of such a holy word! Sacrifice! No one dares\r\nlive up to thee, no one can fulfill thy commands, certainly not one of\r\nus here—and this fool, this miserable money-bag opens its belly, lets\r\nforth a few of its miserable roubles, and shouts ‘Sacrifice!’ And wants\r\nto be thanked, expects a wreath of laurels, the mean scoundrel!”\r\n\r\nGolushkin either did not hear or did not understand what Paklin was\r\nsaying, or perhaps took it only as a joke, because he shouted again,\r\n“Yes, a thousand roubles! Kapiton Golushkin keeps his word!” And so\r\nsaying he thrust his hand into a side pocket. “Here is the money,\r\ntake it! Tear it to pieces! Remember Kapiton!” When under excitement\r\nGolushkin invariably talked of himself in the third person, as children\r\noften do. Nejdanov picked up the notes which Golushkin had flung on the\r\ntable covered with wine stains. Since there was nothing more to wait\r\nfor, and the hour was getting late, they rose, took their hats, and\r\ndeparted.\r\n\r\nThey all felt giddy as soon as they got out into the fresh air,\r\nespecially Paklin.\r\n\r\n“Well, where are we going to now?” he asked with an effort.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know were you are going, but I’m going home,” Solomin replied.\r\n\r\n“Back to the factory?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Now, at night, and on foot?”\r\n\r\n“Why not? I don’t think there are any wolves or robbers here—and my\r\nlegs are quite strong enough to carry me. It’s cooler walking at night.”\r\n\r\n“But hang it all, it’s four miles!”\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t mind if it were more. Good-bye, gentlemen.” Solomin buttoned\r\nhis coat, pulled his cap over his forehead, lighted a cigar, and walked\r\ndown the street with long strides.\r\n\r\n“And where are you going to?” Paklin asked, turning to Nejdanov.\r\n\r\n“I’m going home with him.” He pointed to Markelov, who was standing\r\nmotionless, his hands crossed on his breast. “We have horses and a\r\nconveyance.”\r\n\r\n“Very well.... And I’m going to Fomishka’s and Fimishka’s oasis. And\r\ndo you know what I should like to say? There’s twaddle here and twaddle\r\nthere, only that twaddle, the twaddle of the eighteenth century, is\r\nnearer to the Russian character than the twaddle of the twentieth\r\ncentury. Goodbye, gentlemen. I’m drunk, so don’t be offended at what I\r\nsay, only a better woman than my sister Snandulia... is not to be found\r\non God’s earth, although she is a hunchback and called Snandulia. That’s\r\nhow things are arranged in this world! She ought to have such a name. Do\r\nyou know who Saint Snandulia was? She was a virtuous woman who used to\r\nvisit prisons and heal the wounds of the sick. But... goodbye! goodbye,\r\nNejdanov, thou man to be pitied! And you, officer... ugh! misanthrope!\r\ngoodbye!” He dragged himself away, limping and swaying from side to\r\nside, towards the oasis, while Markelov and Nejdanov sought out the\r\nposting inn where they had left their conveyance, ordered the horses to\r\nbe harnessed, and half an hour later were driving along the high road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\nThe sky was overcast with low-hanging clouds, and though it was light\r\nenough to see the cart-ruts winding along the road, still to the right\r\nand left no separate object could be distinguished, everything blending\r\ntogether into dark, heavy masses. It was a dim, unsettled kind of night;\r\nthe wind blew in terrific gusts, bringing with it the scent of rain and\r\nwheat, which covered the broad fields. When they passed the oak which\r\nserved as a signpost and turned down a by-road, driving became more\r\ndifficult, the narrow track being quite lost at times. The coach moved\r\nalong at a slower pace.\r\n\r\n“I hope we’re not going to lose our way!” Nejdanov remarked; he had been\r\nquite silent until then.\r\n\r\n“I don’t think so,” Markelov responded. “Two misfortunes never happen in\r\none day.”\r\n\r\n“But what was the first misfortune?”\r\n\r\n“A day wasted for nothing. Is that of no importance?”\r\n\r\n“Yes... certainly... and then this Golushkin! We shouldn’t have drank so\r\nmuch wine. My head is simply splitting.”\r\n\r\n“I wasn’t thinking of Golushkin. We got some money from him at any rate,\r\nso our visit wasn’t altogether wasted.”\r\n\r\n“But surely you’re not really sorry that Paklin took us to his... what\r\ndid he call them... poll-parrots?”\r\n\r\n“As for that, there’s nothing to be either sorry or glad about. I’m not\r\ninterested in such people. That wasn’t the misfortune I was referring\r\nto.”\r\n\r\n“What was it then?”\r\n\r\nMarkelov made no reply, but withdrew himself a little further into his\r\ncorner, as if he were muffling himself up. Nejdanov could not see his\r\nface very clearly, only his moustache stood out in a straight black\r\nline, but he had felt ever since the morning that there was something in\r\nMarkelov that was best left alone, some mysteriously unknown worry.\r\n\r\n“I say, Sergai Mihailovitch,” Nejdanov began, “do you really attach any\r\nimportance to Mr. Kisliakov’s letters that you gave me today? They are\r\nutter nonsense, if you’ll excuse my saying so.”\r\n\r\nMarkelov drew himself up.\r\n\r\n“In the first place,” he began angrily, “I don’t agree with you about\r\nthese letters—I find them extremely interesting... and conscientious!\r\nIn the second place, Kisliakov works very hard and, what is more, he is\r\nin earnest; he _believes_ in our cause, believes in the revolution! And\r\nI must say that _you_, Alexai Dmitritch, are very luke-warm—_you_ don’t\r\nbelieve in our cause!”\r\n\r\n“What makes you think so?” Nejdanov asked slowly.\r\n\r\n“It is easy to see from your very words, from your whole behaviour.\r\nToday, for instance, at Golushkin’s, who said that he failed to see any\r\nelements that we could rely on? You! Who demanded to have them pointed\r\nout to him? You again! And when that friend of yours, that grinning\r\nbuffoon, Mr. Paklin, stood up and declared with his eyes raised to\r\nheaven that not one of us was capable of self-sacrifice, who approved\r\nof it and nodded to him encouragingly? Wasn’t it you? Say what you like\r\nof yourself...think what you like of yourself, you know best... that\r\nis your affair, but I know people who could give up everything that is\r\nbeautiful in life—even love itself—to serve their convictions, to be\r\ntrue to them! Well, _you_ ... couldn’t have done that, today at any\r\nrate!”\r\n\r\n“Today? Why not today in particular?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, don’t pretend, for heaven’s sake, you happy Don Juan, you\r\nmyrtle-crowned lover!” Markelov shouted, quite forgetting the coachman,\r\nwho, though he did not turn round on the box, must have heard every\r\nword. It is true the coachman was at that moment more occupied with the\r\nroad than with what the gentlemen were saying behind him. He loosened\r\nthe shaft-horse carefully, though somewhat nervously, she shook her\r\nhead, backed a little, and went down a slope which had no business there\r\nat all.\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid I don’t quite understand you,” Nejdanov observed.\r\n\r\nMarkelov gave a forced, malicious laugh.\r\n\r\n“So you don’t understand me! ha, ha, ha! I know everything, my dear sir!\r\nI know whom you made love to yesterday, whom you’ve completely conquered\r\nwith your good looks and honeyed words! I know who lets you into her\r\nroom... after ten o’clock at night!”\r\n\r\n“Sir!” the coachman exclaimed suddenly, turning to Markelov, “hold the\r\nreins, please. I’ll get down and have a look. I think we’ve gone off the\r\ntrack. There seems a sort of ravine here.”\r\n\r\nThe carriage was, in fact, standing almost on one side. Markelov seized\r\nthe reins which the coachman handed to him and continued just as loudly:\r\n\r\n“I don’t blame you in the least, Alexai Dmitritch! You took advantage\r\nof.... You were quite right. No wonder that you’re not so keen about\r\nour cause now... as I said before, you have something else on your mind.\r\nAnd, really, who can tell beforehand what will please a girl’s heart or\r\nwhat man can achieve what she may desire?”\r\n\r\n“I understand now,” Nejdanov began; “I understand your vexation and can\r\nguess... who spied on us and lost no time in letting you know—” “It does\r\nnot seem to depend on merit,” Markelov continued, pretending not to\r\nhave heard Nejdanov, and purposely drawling out each word in a sing-song\r\nvoice, “no extraordinary spiritual or physical attractions.... Oh no!\r\nIt’s only the damned luck of all... bastards!”\r\n\r\nThe last sentence Markelov pronounced abruptly and hurriedly, but\r\nsuddenly stopped as if turned to stone.\r\n\r\nNejdanov felt himself grow pale in the darkness and tingled all over. He\r\ncould scarcely restrain himself from flying at Markelov and seizing him\r\nby the throat. “Only blood will wipe out this insult,” he thought.\r\n\r\n“I’ve found the road!” the coachman cried, making his appearance at\r\nthe right front wheel, “I turned to the left by mistake—but it doesn’t\r\nmatter, we’ll soon be home. It’s not much farther. Sit still, please!”\r\n\r\nHe got onto the box, took the reins from Markelov, pulled the\r\nshaft-horse a little to one side, and the carriage, after one or two\r\njerks, rolled along more smoothly and evenly. The darkness seemed to\r\npart and lift itself, a cloud of smoke could be seen curling out of a\r\nchimney, ahead some sort of hillock, a light twinkled, vanished, then\r\nanother.... A dog barked.\r\n\r\n“That’s our place,” the coachman observed. “Gee up, my pretties!”\r\n\r\nThe lights became more and more numerous as they drove on.\r\n\r\n“After the way in which you insulted me,” Nejdanov said at last, “you\r\nwill quite understand that I couldn’t spend the night under your roof,\r\nand I must ask you, however unpleasant it may be for me to do so, to be\r\nkind enough to lend me your carriage as soon as we get to your house to\r\ntake me back to the town. Tomorrow I shall find some means of getting\r\nhome, and will then communicate with you in a way which you doubtless\r\nexpect.”\r\n\r\nMarkelov did not reply at once.\r\n\r\n“Nejdanov,” he exclaimed suddenly, in a soft, despairing tone of voice,\r\n“Nejdanov! For Heaven’s sake come into the house if only to let me\r\nbeg for your forgiveness on my knees! Nejdanov! forget... forget\r\nmy senseless words! Oh, if some one only knew how wretched I feel!”\r\n Markelov struck himself on the breast with his fist, a groan seemed to\r\ncome from him. “Nejdanov. Be generous.... Give me your hand.... Say\r\nthat you forgive me!”\r\n\r\nNejdanov held out his hand irresolutely—Markelov squeezed it so hard\r\nthat he could almost have cried out.\r\n\r\nThe carriage stopped at the door of the house.\r\n\r\n“Listen to me, Nejdanov,” Markelov said to him a quarter of an hour\r\nlater in his study, “listen.” (He addressed him as “thou,” and in this\r\nunexpected “_thou_” addressed to a man whom he knew to be a successful\r\nrival, whom he had only just cruelly insulted, wished to kill, to tear\r\nto pieces, in this familiar word “thou” there was a ring of irrevocable\r\nrenunciation, sad, humble supplication, and a kind of claim.... Nejdanov\r\nrecognised this claim and responded to it by addressing him in the same\r\nway.) “Listen! I’ve only just told you that I’ve refused the happiness\r\nof love, renounced everything to serve my convictions.... It wasn’t\r\ntrue, I was only bragging! Love has never been offered to me, I’ve had\r\nnothing to renounce! I was born unlucky and will continue so for the\r\nrest of my days ... and perhaps it’s for the best. Since I can’t get\r\nthat, I must turn my attention to something else! If you can combine\r\nthe one with the other... love and be loved ... and serve the cause at\r\nthe same time, you’re lucky! I envy you ... but as for myself ... I\r\ncan’t. You happy man! You happy man! I can’t.”\r\n\r\nMarkelov said all this softly, sitting on a low stool, his head bent\r\nand arms hanging loose at his sides. Nejdanov stood before him lost in a\r\nsort of dreamy attentiveness, and though Markelov had called him a happy\r\nman, he neither looked happy nor did he feel himself to be so.\r\n\r\n“I was deceived in my youth,” Markelov went on; “she was a remarkable\r\ngirl, but she threw me over... and for whom? For a German! for an\r\nadjutant! And Mariana—”\r\n\r\nHe stopped. It was the first time he had pronounced her name and it\r\nseemed to burn his lips.\r\n\r\n“Mariana did not deceive me. She told me plainly that she did not care\r\nfor me .... There is nothing in me she could care for, so she gave\r\nherself to you. Of course, she was quite free to do so.”\r\n\r\n“Stop a minute!” Nejdanov exclaimed. “What are you saying? What do you\r\nimply by the words ‘gave herself’? I don’t know what your sister told\r\nyou, but I assure you—”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t mean physically, but morally, that is, with the heart and\r\nsoul,” Markelov interrupted him. He was obviously displeased with\r\nNejdanov’s exclamation. “She couldn’t have done better. As for\r\nmy sister, she didn’t, of course, wish to hurt me. It can make no\r\ndifference to her, but she no doubt hates you and Mariana too. She did\r\nnot tell me anything untrue... but enough of her!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” Nejdanov thought to himself, “she does hate us.”\r\n\r\n“It’s all for the best,” Markelov continued, still sitting in the same\r\nposition. “The last fetters have been broken; there is nothing to hinder\r\nme now! It doesn’t matter that Golushkin is an ass, and as for\r\nKisliakov’s letters, they may perhaps be absurd, but we must consider\r\nthe most important thing. Kisliakov says that everything is ready.\r\nPerhaps you don’t believe that too.”\r\n\r\nNejdanov did not reply.\r\n\r\n“You may be right, but if we’ve to wait until everything, absolutely\r\neverything, is ready, we shall never make a beginning. If we weigh _all_\r\nthe consequences beforehand we’re sure to find some bad ones among them.\r\nFor instance, when our forefathers emancipated the serfs, do you think\r\nthey could foresee that a whole class of money-lending landlords would\r\nspring up as a result of the emancipation? Landlords who sell a peasant\r\neight bushels of rotten rye for six roubles and in return for it get\r\nlabour for the whole six roubles, then the same quantity of good\r\nsound rye and interest on top of that! Which means that they drain the\r\npeasants to the last drop of blood! You’ll agree that our emancipators\r\ncould hardly have foreseen that. Even if they had foreseen it, they\r\nwould still have been quite right in freeing the serfs without weighing\r\nall the consequences beforehand! That is why I have decided!”\r\n\r\nNejdanov looked at Markelov with amazement, but the latter turned to one\r\nside and directed his gaze into a corner of the room. He sat with his\r\neyes closed, biting his lips and chewing his moustache.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I’ve decided!” he repeated, striking his knee with his brown hairy\r\nhand. “I’m very obstinate.... It’s not for nothing that I’m half a Little\r\nRussian.”\r\n\r\nHe got up, dragged himself into his bedroom, and came back with a small\r\nportrait of Mariana in a glazed frame.\r\n\r\n“Take this,” he said in a sad, though steady voice. “I drew it some time\r\nago. I don’t draw well, but I think it’s like her.” (It was a pencil\r\nsketch in profile and was certainly like Mariana.) “Take it, Alexai;\r\nit is my bequest, and with this portrait I give you all my rights....\r\nI know I never had any... but you know what I mean! I give you up\r\neverything, and her.... She is very good, Alexai—”\r\n\r\nMarkelov ceased; his chest heaved visibly.\r\n\r\n“Take it. You are not angry with me, are you? Well, take it then. It’s\r\nno use to me... now.”\r\n\r\nNejdanov took the portrait, but a strange sensation oppressed his\r\nheart. It seemed to him that he had no right to take this gift; that\r\nif Markelov knew what was in his, Nejdanov’s, heart, he would not have\r\ngiven it him. He stood holding the round piece of cardboard, carefully\r\nset in a black frame with a mount of gold paper, not knowing what to do\r\nwith it. “Why, this is a man’s whole life I’m holding in my hand,” he\r\nthought. He fully realised the sacrifice Markelov was making, but why,\r\nwhy especially to him? Should he give back the portrait? No! that would\r\nbe the grossest insult. And after all, was not the face dear to him? Did\r\nhe not love her?\r\n\r\nNejdanov turned his gaze on Markelov not without some inward misgiving.\r\n“Was he not looking at him, trying to guess his thoughts?” But Markelov\r\nwas standing in a corner biting his moustache.\r\n\r\nThe old servant came into the room carrying a candle. Markelov started.\r\n\r\n“It’s time we were in bed, Alexai,” he said. “Morning is wiser than\r\nevening. You shall have the horses tomorrow. Goodbye.”\r\n\r\n“And goodbye to you too, old fellow,” he added turning to the servant\r\nand slapping him on the shoulder. “Don’t be angry with me!”\r\n\r\nThe old man was so astonished that he nearly dropped the candle, and\r\nas he fixed his eyes on his master there was an expression in them of\r\nsomething other, something more, than his habitual dejection.\r\n\r\nNejdanov retired to his room. He was feeling wretched. His head was\r\naching from the wine he had drunk, there were ringing noises in his\r\nears, and stars jumping about in front of his eyes, even though he shut\r\nthem. Golushkin, Vasia the clerk, Fomishka and Fimishka, were dancing\r\nabout before him, with Mariana’s form in the distance, as if distrustful\r\nand afraid to come near. Everything that he had said or done during the\r\nday now seemed to him so utterly false, such useless nonsense, and the\r\nthing that ought to be done, ought to be striven for, was nowhere to be\r\nfound; unattainable, under lock and key, in the depths of a bottomless\r\npit.\r\n\r\nHe was filled with a desire to go to Markelov and say to him, “Here,\r\ntake back your gift, take it back!”\r\n\r\n“Ugh! What a miserable thing life is!” he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nHe departed early on the following morning. Markelov was already\r\nstanding at the door surrounded by peasants, but whether he had asked\r\nthem to come, or they had come of their own accord, Nejdanov did not\r\nknow. Markelov said very little and parted with him coldly, but it\r\nseemed to Nejdanov that he had something of importance to communicate to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe old servant made his appearance with his usual melancholy\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\nThe carriage soon left the town behind it, and coming out into the open\r\ncountry began flying at a furious rate. The horses were the same, but\r\nthe driver counted on a good tip, as Nejdanov lived in a rich house.\r\nAnd as is usually the case, when the driver has either had a drink, or\r\nexpects to get one, the horses go at a good pace.\r\n\r\nIt was an ordinary June day, though the air was rather keen. A steady,\r\nhigh wind was blowing, but raising no dust in the road, owing to last\r\nnight’s rain. The laburnums glistened, rustling to and fro in the\r\nbreeze; a ripple ran over everything. From afar the cry of the quail was\r\ncarried over the hills, over the grassy ravines, as if the very cry was\r\npossessed of wings; the rooks were bathing in the sunshine; along the\r\nstraight, bare line of the horizon little specks no bigger than\r\nflies could be distinguished moving about. These were some peasants\r\nre-ploughing a fallow field.\r\n\r\nNejdanov was so lost in thought that he did not see all this. He went\r\non and on and did not even notice when they drove through Sipiagin’s\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\nHe trembled suddenly as he caught sight of the house, the first story\r\nand Mariana’s window. “Yes,” he said to himself, a warm glow entering\r\nhis heart, “Markelov was right. She is a good girl and I love her.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII\r\n\r\nNejdanov changed his clothes hurriedly and went in to give Kolia his\r\nlesson. On the way he ran across Sipiagin in the dining-room. He bowed\r\nto him with chilling politeness, muttered through his teeth, “Got back\r\nall right?” and went into his study. The great statesman had already\r\ndecided in his ministerial mind that as soon as the vacation came to\r\nan end he would lose no time in packing off to St. Petersburg “this\r\nextremely revolutionary young tutor,” but meanwhile would keep an eye\r\non him. _Je n’ai pas eu la main heureuse cette fois-ci_, he thought\r\nto himself, still _j’aurais pu tomber pire_. Valentina Mihailovna’s\r\nsentiments towards Nejdanov however, were not quite so negative; she\r\nsimply could not endure the idea that he, “a mere boy,” had slighted\r\nher! Mariana had not been mistaken, Valentina Mihailovna had listened\r\nat the door in the corridor; the illustrious lady was not above such\r\nproceedings. Although she had said nothing to her “flighty” niece\r\nduring Nejdanov’s absence, still she had let her plainly understand that\r\neverything was known to her, and that if she had not been so painfully\r\nsorry for her, and did not despise her from the bottom of her heart, she\r\nwould have been most frightfully angry at the whole thing.\r\n\r\nAn expression of restrained inward contempt played over her face. She\r\nraised her eyebrows in scorn and pity when she looked at or spoke\r\nto Mariana, and she would fix her wonderful eyes, full of tender\r\nremonstrance and painful disgust, on the willful girl, who, after all\r\nher “fancies and eccentricities,” had ended by kissing an insignificant\r\nundergraduate... in a dark room!\r\n\r\nPoor Mariana! Her severe, proud lips had never tasted any man’s kisses.\r\n\r\nValentina Mihailovna had not told her husband of the discovery she had\r\nmade. She merely contented herself by addressing a few words to Mariana\r\nin his presence, accompanied by a significant smile, quite irrelevant to\r\nthe occasion. She regretted having written to her brother, but was,\r\non the whole, more pleased that the thing was done than be spared the\r\nregret and the letter not written.\r\n\r\nNejdanov got a glimpse of Mariana at lunch in the dining-room. It seemed\r\nto him that she had grown thinner and paler. She was not looking her\r\nbest on that day, but the penetrating glance she turned on him directly\r\nhe entered the room went straight to his heart. Valentina Mihailovna\r\nlooked at him constantly, as though she were inwardly congratulating\r\nhim. “Splendid! Very smart!” he read on her face, while she was studying\r\nhis to find out if Markelov had shown him the letter. She decided in the\r\nend that he had.\r\n\r\nOn hearing that Nejdanov had been to the factory of which Solomin was\r\nthe manager, Sipiagin began asking him various questions about it, but\r\nwas soon convinced from the young man’s replies that he had seen nothing\r\nthere and dropped into a majestic silence, as if reproaching himself\r\nfor having expected any practical knowledge from such an inexperienced\r\nindividual! On going out of the room Mariana managed to whisper to\r\nNejdanov: “Wait for me in the birch grove at the end of the garden. I’ll\r\nbe there as soon as possible.”\r\n\r\n“She is just as familiar with me as Markelov was,” he thought to\r\nhimself, and a strange, pleasant sensation came over him. How strange it\r\nwould have seemed to him if she had suddenly become distant and formal\r\nagain, if she had turned away from him. He felt that such a thing would\r\nhave made him utterly wretched, but was not sure in his own mind whether\r\nhe loved her or not. She was dear to him and he felt the need of her\r\nabove everything—this he acknowledged from the bottom of his heart.\r\n\r\nThe grove Mariana mentioned consisted of some hundreds of big old\r\nweeping-birches. The wind had not fallen and the long tangled branches\r\nwere tossing hither and thither like loosened tresses. The clouds, still\r\nhigh, flew quickly over the sky, every now and again obscuring the\r\nsun and making everything of an even hue. Suddenly it would make its\r\nappearance again and brilliant patches of light would flash out once\r\nmore through the branches, crossing and recrossing, a tangled pattern of\r\nlight and shade. The roar of the trees seemed to be filled with a kind\r\nof festive joy, like to the violent joy with which passion breaks into\r\na sad, troubled heart. It was just such a heart that Nejdanov carried in\r\nhis bosom. He leaned against the trunk of a tree and waited. He did not\r\nreally know what he was feeling and had no desire to know, but it seemed\r\nto him more awful, and at the same time easier, than at Markelov’s.\r\nAbove everything he wanted to see her, to speak to her. The knot that\r\nsuddenly binds two separate existences already had him in its grasp.\r\nNejdanov thought of the rope that is flung to the quay to make fast a\r\nship. Now it is twisted about the post and the ship stops.... Safe in\r\nport! Thank God!\r\n\r\nHe trembled suddenly. A woman’s dress could be seen in the distance\r\ncoming along the path. It was Mariana. But whether she was coming\r\ntowards him or going away from him he could not tell until he noticed\r\nthat the patches of light and shade glided over her figure from below\r\nupwards. So she was coming towards him; they would have glided from\r\nabove downwards had she been going away from him. A few moments longer\r\nand she was standing before him with her bright face full of welcome and\r\na caressing light in her eyes. A glad smile played about her lips. He\r\nseized the hand she held out to him, but could not say a single word;\r\nshe also was silent. She had walked very quickly and was somewhat out\r\nof breath, but seemed glad that he was pleased to see her. She was the\r\nfirst to speak.\r\n\r\n“Well,” she began, “tell me quickly what you’ve decided.”\r\n\r\nNejdanov was surprised.\r\n\r\n“Decided? Why, was it necessary to decide anything just now?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you know what I mean. Tell me what you talked about, whom you’ve\r\nseen—if you’ve met Solomin. Tell me everything, everything. But wait\r\na moment; let us go on a little further. I know a spot not quite so\r\nconspicuous as this.”\r\n\r\nShe made him come with her. He followed her obediently over the tall\r\nthin grass.\r\n\r\nShe led him to the place she mentioned, and they sat down on the trunk\r\nof a birch that had been blown down in a storm.\r\n\r\n“Now begin!” she said, and added directly afterwards, “I am so glad to\r\nsee you again! I thought these two days would never come to an end! Do\r\nyou know, I’m convinced that Valentina Mihailovna listened to us.”\r\n\r\n“She wrote to Markelov about it,” Nejdanov remarked.\r\n\r\n“Did she?”\r\n\r\nMariana was silent for a while. She blushed all over, not from shame,\r\nbut from another, deeper feeling.\r\n\r\n“She is a wicked, spiteful woman!” she said slowly and quietly. “She\r\nhad no right to do such a thing! But it doesn’t matter. Now tell me your\r\nnews.”\r\n\r\nNejdanov began talking and Mariana listened to him with a sort of stony\r\nattention, only stopping him when she thought he was hurrying over\r\nthings, not giving her sufficient details. However, not all the details\r\nof his visit were of equal interest to her; she laughed over Fomishka\r\nand Fimishka, but they did not interest her. Their life was too remote\r\nfrom hers.\r\n\r\n“It’s just like hearing about Nebuchadnezzar,” she remarked.\r\n\r\nBut she was very keen to know what Markelov had said, what Golushkin had\r\nthought (though she soon realised what sort of a bird he was), and above\r\nall wanted to know Solomin’s opinion and what sort of a man he was.\r\nThese were the things that interested her. “But when? when?” was a\r\nquestion constantly in her mind and on her lips the whole time Nejdanov\r\nwas talking, while he, on the other hand, seemed to try and avoid\r\neverything that might give a definite answer to that question. He began\r\nto notice himself that he laid special stress on those details that were\r\nof least interest to Mariana. He pulled himself up, but returned to them\r\nagain involuntarily. Humorous descriptions made her impatient, a\r\nsceptic or dejected tone hurt her. It was necessary to keep strictly\r\nto everything concerning the “cause,” and however much he said on the\r\nsubject did not seem to weary her. It brought back to Nejdanov’s mind\r\nhow once, before he had entered the university, when he was staying with\r\nsome friends of his in the country one summer, he had undertaken to\r\ntell the children some stories; they had also paid no attention to\r\ndescriptions, personal expressions, personal sensations, they had also\r\ndemanded nothing but facts and figures. Mariana was not a child, but she\r\nwas like a child in the directness and simplicity of her feelings.\r\n\r\nNejdanov was sincerely enthusiastic in his praise of Markelov, and\r\nexpressed himself with particular warmth about Solomin. While uttering\r\nthe most enthusiastic expressions about him, he kept asking himself\r\ncontinually why he had such a high opinion of this man. He had not said\r\nanything very brilliant and, in fact, some of his words were in direct\r\nopposition to his (Nejdanov’s) own convictions. “His head is screwed\r\non the right way,” he thought. “A cool, steady man, as Fimishka said;\r\na powerful man, of calm, firm strength. He knows what he wants, has\r\nconfidence in himself, and arouses confidence in others. He has no\r\nanxieties and is well-balanced! That is the main thing; he has balance,\r\njust what is lacking in me!” Nejdanov ceased speaking and became lost in\r\nmeditation. Suddenly he felt a hand on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n“Alexai! What is the matter with you?” Mariana asked.\r\n\r\nHe took her tiny, strong hand from his shoulder and kissed it for the\r\nfirst time. Mariana laughed softly, surprised that such a thing should\r\nhave occurred to him. She in her turn became pensive.\r\n\r\n“Did Markelov show you Valentina Mihailovna’s letter?” she asked at\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n“Yes, he did.”\r\n\r\n“Well, and how is he?”\r\n\r\n“Markelov? He is the most honourable, most unselfish man in existence!\r\nHe—”\r\n\r\nNejdanov wanted to tell Mariana about the portrait, but pulled himself\r\nup and added, “He is the soul of honour!”\r\n\r\n“Oh yes, I know.”\r\n\r\nMariana became pensive again. She suddenly turned to Nejdanov on the\r\ntrunk they were both sitting on and asked quickly:\r\n\r\n“Well? What have you decided on?”\r\n\r\nNejdanov shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n“I’ve already told you, dear, that we’ve decided nothing as yet; we must\r\nwait a little longer.”\r\n\r\n“But why?”\r\n\r\n“Those were our last instructions.” (“I’m lying,” Nejdanov thought to\r\nhimself.)\r\n\r\n“From whom?”\r\n\r\n“Why, you know... from Vassily Nikolaevitch. And then we must wait until\r\nOstrodumov comes back.”\r\n\r\nMariana looked questioningly at Nejdanov. “But tell me, have you ever\r\nseen this Vassily Nikolaevitch?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. I’ve seen him twice ... for a minute or two.”\r\n\r\n“What is he like? Is he an extraordinary man?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t quite know how to tell you. He is our leader now and directs\r\neverything. We couldn’t get on without discipline in our movement; we\r\nmust obey someone.” (“What nonsense I’m talking!” Nejdanov thought.)\r\n\r\n“What is he like to look at?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, he’s short, thick-set, dark, with high cheek-bones like a\r\nKalmick... a rather coarse face, only he has very bright, intelligent\r\neyes.”\r\n\r\n“And what does he talk like?”\r\n\r\n“He does not talk, he commands.”\r\n\r\n“Why did they make him leader?”\r\n\r\n“He is a man of strong character. Won’t give in to anyone. Would sooner\r\nkill if necessary. People are afraid of him.”\r\n\r\n“And what is Solomin like?” Mariana asked after a pause.\r\n\r\n“Solomin is also not good-looking, but has a nice, simple, honest face.\r\nSuch faces are to be found among schoolboys of the right sort.”\r\n\r\nNejdanov had described Solomin accurately.\r\n\r\nMariana gazed at him for a long, long time, then said, as if to herself:\r\n\r\n“You have also a nice face. I think it would be easy to get on with\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nNejdanov was touched; he took her hand again and raised it to his lips.\r\n\r\n“No more gallantries!” she said laughing. Mariana always laughed when\r\nher hand was kissed. “I’ve done something very naughty and must ask you\r\nto forgive me.”\r\n\r\n“What have you done?”\r\n\r\n“Well, when you were away, I went into your room and saw a copy-book of\r\nverses lying on your table” (Nejdanov shuddered; he remembered having\r\nleft it there), “and I must confess to you that I couldn’t overcome my\r\ncuriosity and read the contents. Are they your verses?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, they are. And do you know, Mariana, that one of the strongest\r\nproofs that I care for you and have the fullest confidence in you is\r\nthat I am hardly angry at what you have done?”\r\n\r\n“Hardly! Then you are just a tiny bit. I’m so glad you call me Mariana.\r\nI can’t call you Nejdanov, so I shall call you Alexai. There is a poem\r\nwhich begins, ‘When I die, dear friend, remember,’ is that also yours?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Only please don’t talk about this any more.... Don’t torture me.”\r\n\r\nMariana shook her head.\r\n\r\n“It’s a very sad poem.... I hope you wrote it before we became intimate.\r\nThe verses are good though ... as far as I can judge. I think you have\r\nthe making of a literary man in you, but you have chosen a better and\r\nhigher calling than literature. It was good to do that kind of work when\r\nit was impossible to do anything else.”\r\n\r\nNejdanov looked at her quickly.\r\n\r\n“Do you think so? I agree with you. Better ruin there, than success\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\nMariana stood up with difficulty.\r\n\r\n“Yes, my dear, you are right!” she exclaimed, her whole face beaming\r\nwith triumph and emotion, “you are right! But perhaps it may not mean\r\nruin for us yet. We shall succeed, you will see; we’ll be useful, our\r\nlife won’t be wasted. We’ll go among the people.... Do you know any\r\nsort of handicraft? No? Never mind, we’ll work just the same. We’ll\r\nbring them, our brothers, everything that we know.... If necessary, I\r\ncan cook, wash, sew.... You’ll see, you’ll see.... And there won’t be\r\nany kind of merit in it, only happiness, happiness—”\r\n\r\nMariana ceased and fixed her eyes eagerly in the distance, not that\r\nwhich lay before her, but another distance as yet unknown to her, which\r\nshe seemed to see.... She was all aglow.\r\n\r\nNejdanov bent down to her waist.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Mariana!” he whispered. “I am not worthy of you!”\r\n\r\nShe trembled all over.\r\n\r\n“It’s time to go home!” she exclaimed, “or Valentina Mihailovna will be\r\nlooking for us again. However, I think she’s given me up as a bad job.\r\nI’m quite a black sheep in her eyes.”\r\n\r\nMariana pronounced the last words with such a bright joyful expression\r\nthat Nejdanov could not help laughing as he looked at her and repeating,\r\n“black sheep!”\r\n\r\n“She is awfully hurt,” Mariana went on, “that you are not at her feet.\r\nBut that is nothing. The most important thing is that I can’t stay here\r\nany longer. I must run away.”\r\n\r\n“Run away?” Nejdanov asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes.... You are not going to stay here, are you? We’ll go away\r\ntogether.... We must work together.... You’ll come with me, won’t you?”\r\n\r\n“To the ends of the earth!” Nejdanov exclaimed, his voice ringing with\r\nsudden emotion in a transport of gratitude. “To the ends of the earth!”\r\n At that moment he would have gone with her wherever she wanted, without\r\nso much as looking back.\r\n\r\nMariana understood him and gave a gentle, blissful sigh.\r\n\r\n“Then take my hand, dearest—only don’t kiss it—press it firmly, like a\r\ncomrade, like a friend—like this!”\r\n\r\nThey walked home together, pensive, happy. The young grass caressed\r\ntheir feet, the young leaves rustled about them, patches of light and\r\nshade played over their garments—and they both smiled at the wild\r\nplay of the light, at the merry gusts of wind, at the fresh, sparkling\r\nleaves, at their own youth, and at one another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII\r\n\r\nThe dawn was already approaching on the night after Golushkin’s dinner\r\nwhen Solomin, after a brisk walk of about five miles, knocked at the\r\ngate in the high wall surrounding the factory. The watchman let him in\r\nat once and, followed by three house-dogs wagging their tails with great\r\ndelight, accompanied him respectfully to his own dwelling. He seemed to\r\nbe very pleased that the chief had got back safely.\r\n\r\n“How did you manage to get here at night, Vassily Fedotitch? We didn’t\r\nexpect you until tomorrow.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, that’s all right, Gavrilla. It’s much nicer walking at night.”\r\n\r\nThe most unusually friendly relations existed between Solomin and his\r\nworkpeople. They respected him as a superior, treated him as one of\r\nthemselves, and considered him to be very learned. “Whatever Vassily\r\nFedotitch says,” they declared, “is sacred! Because he has learned\r\neverything there is to be learned, and there isn’t an Englishman who can\r\nget around him!” And in fact, a certain well-known English manufacturer\r\nhad once visited the factory, but whether it was that Solomin could\r\nspeak to him in his own tongue or that he was really impressed by his\r\nknowledge is uncertain; he had laughed, slapped him on the shoulder, and\r\ninvited him to come to Liverpool with him, saying to the workmen, in his\r\nbroken Russian, “Oh, he’s all right, your man here!” At which the men\r\nlaughed a great deal, not without a touch of pride. “So that’s what he\r\nis! Our man!”\r\n\r\nAnd he really was theirs and one of them. Early the next morning his\r\nfavourite Pavel woke him, prepared his things for washing, told him\r\nvarious news, and asked him various questions. They partook of some\r\ntea together hastily, after which Solomin put on his grey, greasy\r\nworking-jacket and set out for the factory; and his life began to go\r\nround again like some huge flywheel.\r\n\r\nBut the thread had to be broken again. Five days after Solomin’s return\r\nhome there drove into the courtyard a smart little phaeton, harnessed\r\nto four splendid horses and a footman in pale green livery, whom Pavel\r\nconducted to the little wing, where he solemnly handed Solomin a letter\r\nsealed with an armorial crest, from “His Excellency Boris Andraevitch\r\nSipiagin.” In this letter, which exhaled an odour, not of perfume, but\r\nof some extraordinarily respectable English smell and was written in\r\nthe third person, not by a secretary, but by the gentleman himself,\r\nthe cultured owner of the village Arjanov, he begged to be excused for\r\naddressing himself to a man with whom he had not the honour of being\r\npersonally acquainted, but of whom he, Sipiagin, had heard so many\r\nflattering accounts, and ventured to invite Mr. Solomin to come and\r\nsee him at his house, as he very much wanted to ask his valuable advice\r\nabout a manufacturing enterprise of some importance he had embarked\r\nupon. In the hope that Mr. Solomin would be kind enough to come, he,\r\nSipiagin, had sent him his carriage, but in the event of his being\r\nunable to do so on that day, would he be kind enough to choose any other\r\nday that might be convenient for him and the same carriage would be\r\ngladly put at his disposal. Then followed the usual polite signature and\r\na postscript written in the first person:\r\n\r\n“I hope that you will not refuse to take dinner with us _quite simply_.\r\nNo dress clothes.” (The words “quite simply” were underlined.)\r\nTogether with this letter the footman (not without a certain amount of\r\nembarrassment) gave Solomin another letter from Nejdanov. It was just a\r\nsimple note, not sealed with wax but merely stuck down, containing\r\nthe following lines: “Do please come. You’re wanted badly and may be\r\nextremely useful. I need hardly say not to Mr. Sipiagin.”\r\n\r\nOn finishing Sipiagin’s letter Solomin thought, “How else can I go if\r\nnot simply? I haven’t any dress clothes at the factory.... And what the\r\ndevil should I drag myself over there for? It’s just a waste of time!”\r\nBut after reading Nejdanov’s note, he scratched the back of his neck\r\nand walked over to the window, irresolute.\r\n\r\n“What answer am I to take back, sir?” the footman in green livery asked\r\nslowly.\r\n\r\nSolomin stood for some seconds longer at the window.\r\n\r\n“I am coming with you,” he announced, shaking back his hair and passing\r\nhis hand over his forehead—“just let me get dressed.”\r\n\r\nThe footman left the room respectfully and Solomin sent for Pavel, had\r\na talk with him, ran across to the factory once more, then putting on a\r\nblack coat with a very long waist, which had been made by a provincial\r\ntailor, and a shabby top-hat which instantly gave his face a wooden\r\nexpression, took his seat in the phaeton. He suddenly remembered that he\r\nhad forgotten his gloves, and called out to the “never-failing” Pavel,\r\nwho brought him a pair of newly-washed white kid ones, the fingers of\r\nwhich were so stretched at the tips that they looked like long biscuits.\r\nSolomin thrust the gloves into his pocket and gave the order to start.\r\nThen the footman jumped onto the box with an unnecessary amount of\r\nalacrity, the well-bred coachman sang out in a falsetto voice, and the\r\nhorses started off at a gallop.\r\n\r\nWhile the horses were bearing Solomin along to Sipiagin’s, that\r\ngentleman was sitting in his drawing-room with a halfcut political\r\npamphlet on his knee, discussing him with his wife. He confided to her\r\nthat he had written to him with the express purpose of trying to get him\r\naway from the merchant’s factory to his own, which was in a very bad way\r\nand needed reorganising. Sipiagin would not for a moment entertain\r\nthe idea that Solomin would refuse to come, or even so much as appoint\r\nanother day, though he had himself suggested it.\r\n\r\n“But ours is a paper-mill, not a spinning-mill,” Valentina Mihailovna\r\nremarked.\r\n\r\n“It’s all the same, my dear, machines are used in both, and he’s a\r\nmechanic.”\r\n\r\n“But supposing he turns out to be a specialist!”\r\n\r\n“My dear! In the first place there are no such things as specialists in\r\nRussia; in the second, I’ve told you that he’s a mechanic!”\r\n\r\nValentina Mihailovna smiled.\r\n\r\n“Do be careful, my dear. You’ve been unfortunate once already with young\r\nmen; mind you don’t make a second mistake.”\r\n\r\n“Are you referring to Nejdanov? I don’t think I’ve been altogether\r\nmistaken with regard to him. He has been a good tutor to Kolia. And\r\nthen you know _non bis in idem_! Excuse my being pedantic.... It means,\r\nthings don’t repeat themselves!”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you think so? Well, _I_ think that everything in the world\r\nrepeats itself ... especially what’s in the nature of things ... and\r\nparticularly among young people.”\r\n\r\n_“Que voulez-vous dire?”_ asked Sipiagin, flinging the pamphlet on the\r\ntable with a graceful gesture of the hand.\r\n\r\n_“Ouvrez les yeux, et vous verrez!”_ Madame Sipiagina replied. They always\r\nspoke to one another in French.\r\n\r\n“H’m!” Sipiagin grunted. “Are you referring to that student?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I’m referring to him.”\r\n\r\n“H’m! Has he got anything on here, eh?” (He passed his hand over his\r\nforehead.)\r\n\r\n“Open your eyes!”\r\n\r\n“Is it Mariana, eh?” (The second  “eh” was pronounced more through the\r\nnose than the first one.)\r\n\r\n“Open your eyes, I tell you!”\r\n\r\nSipiagin frowned.\r\n\r\n“We must talk about this later on. I should just like to say now that\r\nthis Solomin may feel rather uncomfortable.... You see, he is not used\r\nto society. We must be nice to him so as to make him feel at his ease.\r\nOf course, I don’t mean this for you, you’re such a dear, that I think\r\nyou could fascinate anyone if you chose. _J’en sais quelque chose,\r\nmadame!_ I mean this for the others, if only for——”\r\n\r\nHe pointed to a fashionable grey hat lying on a shelf. It belonged to\r\nMr. Kollomietzev, who had been in Arjanov since the morning.\r\n\r\n“_Il est très cassant_ you know. He has far too great a contempt for the\r\npeople for my liking. And he has been so frightfully quarrelsome and\r\nirritable of late. Is his little affair _there_ not getting on well?”\r\n\r\nSipiagin nodded his head in some indefinite direction, but his wife\r\nunderstood him.\r\n\r\n“Open your eyes, I tell you again!”\r\n\r\nSipiagin stood up.\r\n\r\n“Eh?” (This “eh” was pronounced in a quite different tone, much lower.)\r\n“Is that how the land lies? They had better take care I don’t open them\r\ntoo wide!”\r\n\r\n“That is your own affair, my dear. But as for that new young man of\r\nyours, you may be quite easy about him. I will see that everything is\r\nall right. Every precaution will be taken.”\r\n\r\nIt turned out that no precautions were necessary, however. Solomin was\r\nnot in the least alarmed or embarrassed.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he was announced Sipiagin jumped up, exclaiming in a voice\r\nloud enough to be heard in the hall, “Show him in, of course show him\r\nin!” He then went up to the drawing-room door and stood waiting. No\r\nsooner had Solomin crossed the threshold, almost knocking against\r\nSipiagin, when the latter extended both his hands, saying with an\r\namiable smile and a friendly shake of the head, “How very nice of you to\r\ncome.... I can hardly thank you enough.” Then he led him up to Valentina\r\nMihailovna.\r\n\r\n“Allow me to introduce you to my wife,” he said, gently pressing his\r\nhand against Solomin’s back, pushing him towards her as it were. “My\r\ndear, here is our best local engineer and manufacturer, Vassily...\r\nFedosaitch Solomin.”\r\n\r\nMadame Sipiagina stood up, raised her wonderful eyelashes, smiled\r\nsweetly as to an acquaintance, extended her hand with the palm upwards,\r\nher elbow pressed against her waist, her head bent a little to the\r\nright, in the attitude of a suppliant. Solomin let the husband and wife\r\ngo through their little comedy, shook hands with them both, and sat\r\ndown at the first invitation to do so. Sipiagin began to fuss about him,\r\nasking if he would like anything, but Solomin assured him that he wanted\r\nnothing and was not in the least bit tired from the journey.\r\n\r\n“Then may we go to the factory?” Sipiagin asked, a little shame-faced,\r\nnot daring to believe in so much condescension on the part of his guest.\r\n\r\n“As soon as you like, I’m quite ready,” Solomin replied. “How awfully\r\ngood of you! Shall we drive or would you like to walk?”\r\n\r\n“Is it a long way?”\r\n\r\n“About half a mile.”\r\n\r\n“It’s hardly worthwhile bringing out the carriage.”\r\n\r\n“Very well. Ivan! my hat and stick! Make haste! And you’ll see about\r\nsome dinner, little one, won’t you? My hat, quick!”\r\n\r\nSipiagin was far more excited than his visitor, and calling out once\r\nmore, “Why don’t they give me my hat,” he, the stately dignitary,\r\nrushed out like a frolicsome schoolboy. While her husband was talking to\r\nSolomin, Valentina Mihailovna looked at him stealthily, trying to make\r\nout this new “young man.” He was sitting in an armchair, quite at his\r\nease, his bare hands laid on his knee (he had not put on the gloves\r\nafter all), calmly, although not without a certain amount of curiosity,\r\nlooking around at the furniture and pictures. “I don’t understand,”\r\n she thought, “he’s a plebeian—quite a plebeian—and yet behaves so\r\nnaturally!” Solomin did indeed carry himself naturally, not with any\r\nview to effect, as much as to say “Look what a splendid fellow I am!”\r\n but as a man whose thoughts and feelings are simple, direct, and strong\r\nat the same time. Madame Sipiagina wanted to say something to him, but\r\nwas surprised to find that she did not quite know how to begin.\r\n\r\n“Heavens!” she thought. “This mechanic is making me quite nervous!”\r\n\r\n“My husband must be very grateful to you,” she remarked at last. “It was\r\nso good of you to sacrifice a few hours of your valuable time—”\r\n\r\n“My time is not so very valuable, madame,” he observed. “Besides, I’ve\r\nnot come here for long.”\r\n\r\n_“Voilà où l’ours a montré sa patte,”_ she thought in French, but at this\r\nmoment her husband appeared in the doorway, his hat on his head and a\r\nwalking stick in his hand.\r\n\r\n“Are you ready, Vassily Fedosaitch?” he asked in a free and easy tone,\r\nhalf turned towards him.\r\n\r\nSolomin rose, bowed to Valentina Mihailovna, and walked out behind\r\nSipiagin.\r\n\r\n“This way, this way, Vassily Fedosaitch!” Sipiagin called out, just\r\nas if they were groping their way through a tangled forest and Solomin\r\nneeded a guide. “This way! Do be careful, there are some steps here,\r\nVassily Fedosaitch!”\r\n\r\n“If you want to call me by my father’s Christian name,” Solomin said\r\nslowly, “then it isn’t Fedosaitch, but Fedotitch.”\r\n\r\nSipiagin was taken aback and looked at him over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n“I’m so sorry, Vassily Fedotitch.”\r\n\r\n“Please don’t mention it.”\r\n\r\nAs soon as they got outside they ran against Kollomietzev.\r\n\r\n“Where are you off to?” the latter asked, looking askance at Solomin.\r\n“Are you going to the factory? _C’est là l’individu en question?_”\r\n\r\nSipiagin opened his eyes wide and shook his head slightly by way of\r\nwarning.\r\n\r\n“Yes, we’re going to the factory. I want to show all my sins and\r\ntransgressions to this gentleman, who is an engineer. Allow me to\r\nintroduce you. Mr. Kollomietzev, a neighbouring landowner, Mr. Solomin.”\r\n\r\nKollomietzev nodded his head twice in an off-hand manner without looking\r\nat Solomin, but the latter looked at him and there was a sinister gleam\r\nin his half-closed eyes.\r\n\r\n“May I come with you?” Kollomietzev asked. “You know I’m always ready to\r\nlearn.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, if you like.”\r\n\r\nThey went out of the courtyard into the road and had scarcely taken\r\ntwenty steps when they ran across a priest in a woven cassock, who was\r\nwending his way homeward. Kollomietzev left his two companions and,\r\ngoing up to him with long, firm strides, asked for his blessing and gave\r\nhim a sounding smack on his moist, red hand, much to the discomfiture\r\nof the priest, who did not in the least expect this sort of outburst.\r\nHe then turned to Solomin and gave him a defiant look. He had evidently\r\nheard something about him and wanted to show off and get some fun out of\r\nthis learned scoundrel.\r\n\r\n_“C’est une manifestation, mon cher?”_ Sipiagin muttered through his\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\nKollomietzev giggled.\r\n\r\n_“Oui, mon cher, une manifestation nécessaire par temps qui court!”_\r\n\r\nThey got to the factory and were met by a Little Russian with an\r\nenormous beard and false teeth, who had taken the place of the former\r\nmanager, a German, whom Sipiagin had dismissed. This man was there in a\r\ntemporary capacity and understood absolutely nothing; he merely kept\r\non saying “Just so... yes... that’s it,” and sighing all the time. They\r\nbegan inspecting the place. Several of the workmen knew Solomin by sight\r\nand bowed to him. He even called out to one of them, “Hallo, Gregory!\r\nYou here?” Solomin was soon convinced that the place was going badly.\r\nMoney was simply thrown away for no reason whatever. The machines turned\r\nout to be of a very poor kind; many of them were quite superfluous and\r\na great many necessary ones were lacking. Sipiagin kept looking\r\ninto Solomin’s face, trying to guess his opinion, asked a few timid\r\nquestions, wanted to know if he was at any rate satisfied with the order\r\nof the place.\r\n\r\n“Oh, the order is all right,” Solomin replied, “but I doubt if you can\r\nget anything out of it.”\r\n\r\nNot only Sipiagin, but even Kollomietzev felt, that in the factory\r\nSolomin was quite at home, was familiar with every little detail, was\r\nmaster there in fact. He laid his hand on a machine as a rider on his\r\nhorse’s neck; he poked a wheel with his finger and it either stood still\r\nor began whirling round; he took some paper pulp out of a vat and it\r\ninstantly revealed all its defects.\r\n\r\nSolomin said very little, took no notice of the Little Russian at all,\r\nand went out without saying anything. Sipiagin and Kollomietzev followed\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nSipiagin was so upset that he did not let any one accompany him. He\r\nstamped and ground his teeth with rage.\r\n\r\n“I can see by your face,” he said turning to Solomin, “that you are\r\nnot pleased with the place. Of course, I know that it’s not in a very\r\nexcellent condition and doesn’t pay as yet. But please ... give me your\r\ncandid opinion as to what you consider to be the principal failings and\r\nas to what one could do to improve matters.”\r\n\r\n“Paper-manufacturing is not in my line,” Solomin began, “but I can tell\r\nyou one thing. I doubt if the aristocracy is cut out for industrial\r\nenterprises.”\r\n\r\n“Do you consider it degrading for the aristocracy?” Kollomietzev asked.\r\n\r\nSolomin smiled his habitual broad smile.\r\n\r\n“Oh dear no! What is there degrading about it? And even if there were, I\r\ndon’t think the aristocracy would be overly particular.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“I only meant,” Solomin continued, calmly, “that the gentry are not used\r\nto that kind of business. A knowledge of commerce is needed for that;\r\neverything has to be put on a different footing, you want technical\r\ntraining for it. The gentry don’t understand this. We see them starting\r\nwoollen, cotton, and other factories all over the place, but they nearly\r\nalways fall into the hands of the merchants in the end. It’s a pity,\r\nbecause the merchants are even worse sweaters. But it can’t be helped, I\r\nsuppose.”\r\n\r\n“To listen to you one would think that all questions of finance were\r\nabove our nobility!” Kollomietzev exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Oh no! On the other hand the nobility are masters at it. For getting\r\nconcessions for railways, founding banks, exempting themselves from some\r\ntax, or anything like that, there is no one to beat them! They make huge\r\nfortunes. I hinted at that just now, but it seemed to offend you. I had\r\nregular industrial enterprises in my mind when I spoke; I say _regular_,\r\nbecause founding private public houses, petty little grocers’ shops, or\r\nlending the peasants corn or money at a hundred or a hundred and fifty\r\npercent, as many of our landed gentry are now doing, I cannot consider\r\nas genuine financial enterprises.”\r\n\r\nKollomietzev did not say anything. He belonged to that new species of\r\nmoney-lending landlord whom Markelov had mentioned in his last talk\r\nwith Nejdanov, and was the more inhuman in his demands that he had no\r\npersonal dealings with the peasants themselves. He never allowed them\r\ninto his perfumed European study, and conducted all his business with\r\nthem through his manager. He was boiling with rage while listening\r\nto Solomin’s slow, impartial speech, but he held his peace; only the\r\nworking of the muscles of his face betrayed what was passing within him.\r\n\r\n“But allow me, Vassily Fedotitch,” Sipiagin began; “what you have just\r\nsaid may have been quite true in former days, when the nobility had\r\nquite different privileges and were altogether in a different position;\r\nbut now, after all the beneficial reforms in our present industrial\r\nage, why should not the nobility turn their attention and bring their\r\nabilities into enterprises of this nature? Why shouldn’t they be able to\r\nunderstand what is understood by a simple illiterate merchant? They are\r\nnot suffering from lack of education and one might even claim, without\r\nany exaggeration, that they are, in a certain sense, the representatives\r\nof enlightenment and progress.”\r\n\r\nBoris Andraevitch spoke very well; his eloquence would have made a great\r\nstir in St. Petersburg, in his department, or maybe in higher quarters,\r\nbut it produced no effect whatever on Solomin.\r\n\r\n“The nobility cannot manage these things,” Solomin repeated.\r\n\r\n“But why, I should like to know? Why?” Kollomietzev almost shouted.\r\n\r\n“Because there is too much of the bureaucrat about them.”\r\n\r\n“Bureaucrat?” Kollomietzev laughed maliciously. “I don’t think you quite\r\nrealise what you’re saying, Mr. Solomin.”\r\n\r\nSolomin continued smiling.\r\n\r\n“What makes you think so, Mr. Kolomentzev?” (Kollomietzev shuddered at\r\nhearing his name thus mutilated.) “I assure you that I always realise\r\nwhat I am saying.”\r\n\r\n“Then please explain what you meant just now!”\r\n\r\n“With pleasure. I think that every bureaucrat is an outsider and was\r\nalways such. The nobility have now become ‘outsiders.’”\r\n\r\nKollomietzev laughed louder than ever.\r\n\r\n“But, my dear sir, I really don’t understand what you mean!”\r\n\r\n“So much the worse for you. Perhaps you will if you try hard enough.”\r\n\r\n“Sir!”\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen, gentlemen,” Sipiagin interposed hastily, trying to catch\r\nsomeone’s eye, “please, please... Kallomeitzeff, _je vous prie de vous\r\ncalmer_. I suppose dinner will soon be ready. Come along, gentlemen!”\r\n\r\n“Valentina Mihailovna!” Kollomietzev cried out five minutes later,\r\nrushing into her boudoir. “I really don’t know what your husband is\r\ndoing! He has brought us one nihilist and now he’s bringing us another!\r\nOnly this one is much worse!”\r\n\r\n“But why?”\r\n\r\n“He is advocating the most awful things, and what do you think? He\r\nhas been talking to your husband for a whole hour, and not once, _not\r\nonce_, did he address him as Your Excellency! _Le vagabond!_”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV\r\n\r\nJust before dinner Sipiagin called his wife into the library. He wanted\r\nto have a talk with her alone. He seemed worried. He told her that the\r\nfactory was really in a bad way, that Solomin struck him as a capable\r\nman, although a little stiff, and thought it was necessary to continue\r\nbeing _aux petits soins_ with him.\r\n\r\n“How I should like to get hold of him!” he repeated once or twice.\r\nSipiagin was very much annoyed at Kollomietzev’s being there. “Devil\r\ntake the man! He sees nihilists everywhere and is always wanting to\r\nsuppress them! Let him do it at his own house I He simply can’t hold his\r\ntongue!”\r\n\r\nValentina Mihailovna said that she would be delighted to be _aux petits\r\nsoins_ with the new visitor, but it seemed to her that he had no need of\r\nthese _petits soins_ and took no notice of them; not rudely in any way,\r\nbut he was quite indifferent; very remarkable in a man _du commun_.\r\n\r\n“Never mind.... Be nice to him just the same!” Sipiagin begged of her.\r\n\r\nValentina Mihailovna promised to do what he wanted and fulfilled\r\nher promise conscientiously. She began by having a _tête-à-tête_ with\r\nKollomietzev. What she said to him remains a secret, but he came to the\r\ntable with the air of a man who had made up his mind to be discreet and\r\nsubmissive at all costs. This “resignation” gave his whole bearing a\r\nslight touch of melancholy; and what dignity... oh, what dignity there\r\nwas in every one of his movements! Valentina Mihailovna introduced\r\nSolomin to everybody (he looked more attentively at Mariana than at\r\nany of the others), and made him sit beside her on her right at table.\r\nKollomietzev sat on her left, and as he unfolded his serviette screwed\r\nup his face and smiled, as much as to say, “Well, now let us begin our\r\nlittle comedy!” Sipiagin sat on the opposite side and watched him with\r\nsome anxiety. By a new arrangement of Madame Sipiagina, Nejdanov was not\r\nput next to Mariana as usual, but between Anna Zaharovna and Sipiagin.\r\nMariana found her card (as the dinner was a stately one) on her\r\nserviette between Kollomietzev and Kolia. The dinner was excellently\r\nserved; there was even a “menu”—a painted card lay before each person.\r\n\r\nDirectly soup was finished, Sipiagin again brought the conversation\r\nround to his factory, and from there went on to Russian manufacture in\r\ngeneral. Solomin, as usual, replied very briefly. As soon as he began\r\nspeaking, Mariana fixed her eyes upon him. Kollomietzev, who was sitting\r\nbeside her, turned to her with various compliments (he had been asked\r\nnot to start a dispute), but she did not listen to him; and indeed he\r\npronounced all his pleasantries in a half-hearted manner, merely to\r\nsatisfy his own conscience. He realised that there was something between\r\nhimself and this young girl that could not be crossed.\r\n\r\nAs for Nejdanov, something even worse had come to pass between him and\r\nthe master of the house. For Sipiagin, Nejdanov had become simply a\r\npiece of furniture, or an empty space that he quite ignored. These new\r\nrelations had taken place so quickly and unmistakably that when Nejdanov\r\npronounced a few words in answer to a remark of Anna Zaharovna’s,\r\nSipiagin looked round in amazement, as if wondering where the sound came\r\nfrom.\r\n\r\nSipiagin evidently possessed some of the characteristics for which\r\ncertain of the great Russian bureaucrats are celebrated for.\r\n\r\nAfter the fish, Valentina Mihailovna, who had been lavishing all her\r\ncharms on Solomin, said to her husband in English that she noticed their\r\nvisitor did not drink wine and might perhaps like some beer. Sipiagin\r\ncalled aloud for ale, while Solomin calmly turned towards Valentina\r\nMihailovna, saying, “You may not be aware, madame, that I spent over two\r\nyears in England and can understand and speak English. I only mentioned\r\nit in case you should wish to say anything private before me.” Valentina\r\nMihailovna laughed and assured him that this precaution was altogether\r\nunnecessary, since he would hear nothing but good of himself; inwardly\r\nshe thought Solomin’s action rather strange, but delicate in its own\r\nway.\r\n\r\nAt this point Kollomietzev could no longer contain himself. “And so\r\nyou’ve been in England,” he began, “and no doubt studied the manners and\r\ncustoms there. Do you think them worth imitating?”\r\n\r\n“Some yes, others no.”\r\n\r\n“Brief but not clear,” Kollomietzev remarked, trying not to notice the\r\nsigns Sipiagin was making to him. “You were speaking of the nobility\r\nthis morning.... No doubt you’ve had the opportunity of studying the\r\nEnglish landed gentry, as they call them there.”\r\n\r\n“No, I had no such opportunity. I moved in quite a different sphere. But\r\nI formed my own ideas about these gentlemen.”\r\n\r\n“Well, do you think that such a landed gentry is impossible among us? Or\r\nthat we ought not to want it in any case?”\r\n\r\n“In the first place, I certainly do think it impossible, and in the\r\nsecond, it’s hardly worthwhile wanting such a thing.”\r\n\r\n“But why, my dear sir?” Kollomietzev asked; the polite tone was intended\r\nto soothe Sipiagin, who sat very uneasily on his chair.\r\n\r\n“Because in twenty or thirty years your landed gentry won’t be here in\r\nany case.”\r\n\r\n“What makes you think so?”\r\n\r\n“Because by that time the land will fall into the hands of people in no\r\nway distinguished by their origin.”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean the merchants?”\r\n\r\n“For the most part probably the merchants.”\r\n\r\n“But how will it happen?”\r\n\r\n“They’ll buy it, of course.”\r\n\r\n“From the gentry?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; from the gentry.”\r\n\r\nKollomietzev smiled condescendingly. “If you recollect you said the very\r\nsame thing about factories that you’re now saying about the land.”\r\n\r\n“And it’s quite true.”\r\n\r\n“You will no doubt be very pleased about it!”\r\n\r\n“Not at all. I’ve already told you that the people won’t be any the\r\nbetter off for the change.”\r\n\r\nKollomietzev raised his hand slightly. “What solicitude on the part of\r\nthe people, imagine!”\r\n\r\n“Vassily Fedotitch!” Sipiagin called out as loudly as he could, “they\r\nhave brought you some beer! _Voyons, Siméon!_” he added in an undertone.\r\n\r\nBut Kollomietzev would not be suppressed.\r\n\r\n“I see you haven’t a very high opinion of the merchant class,” he began\r\nagain, turning to Solomin, “but they’ve sprung from the people.”\r\n\r\n“So they have.”\r\n\r\n“I thought that you considered everything about the people, or relating\r\nto the people, as above criticism!”\r\n\r\n“Not at all! You are quite mistaken. The masses can be condemned for a\r\ngreat many things, though they are not always to blame. Our merchant\r\nis an exploiter and uses his capital for that purpose. He thinks that\r\npeople are always trying to get the better of him, so he tries to get\r\nthe better of them. But the people—”\r\n\r\n“Well, what about the people?” Kollomietzev asked in falsetto.\r\n\r\n“The people are asleep.”\r\n\r\n“And would you like to wake them?”\r\n\r\n“That would not be a bad thing to do.”\r\n\r\n“Aha! aha! So that’s what—”\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen, gentlemen!” Sipiagin exclaimed imperatively. He felt that\r\nthe moment had come to put an end to the discussion, and he did put\r\nan end to it. With a slight gesture of his right hand, while the elbow\r\nremained propped on the table, he delivered a long and detailed speech.\r\nHe praised the conservatives on the one hand and approved of the\r\nliberals on the other, giving the preference to the latter as he counted\r\nhimself of their numbers. He spoke highly of the people, but drew\r\nattention to some of their weaknesses; expressed his full confidence\r\nin the government, but asked himself whether _all_ its officials were\r\nfaithfully fulfilling its benevolent designs. He acknowledged the\r\nimportance of literature, but declared that without the utmost caution\r\nit was dangerous. He turned to the West with hope, then became doubtful;\r\nhe turned to the East, first sighed, then became enthusiastic. Finally\r\nhe proposed a toast in honour of the trinity: Religion, Agriculture, and\r\nIndustry!\r\n\r\n“Under the wing of authority!” Kollomietzev added sternly.\r\n\r\n“Under the wing of wise and benevolent authority,” Sipiagin corrected\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe toast was drunk in silence. The empty space on Sipiagin’s left, in\r\nthe form of Nejdanov, did certainly make several sounds of disapproval;\r\nbut arousing not the least attention became quiet again, and the dinner,\r\nwithout any further controversy, reached a happy conclusion.\r\n\r\nValentina Mihailovna, with a most charming smile, handed Solomin a cup\r\nof coffee; he drank it and was already looking round for his hat when\r\nSipiagin took him gently by the arm and led him into his study. There he\r\nfirst gave him an excellent cigar and then made him a proposal to enter\r\nhis factory on the most advantageous terms. “You will be absolute master\r\nthere, Vassily Fedotitch, I assure you!” Solomin accepted the cigar and\r\ndeclined the offer about the factory. He stuck to his refusal, however\r\nmuch Sipiagin insisted.\r\n\r\n“Please don’t say ‘no’ at once, my dear Vassily Fedotitch! Say, at\r\nleast, that you’ll think it over until tomorrow!”\r\n\r\n“It would make no difference. I wouldn’t accept your proposal.”\r\n\r\n“Do think it over till tomorrow, Vassily Fedotitch! It won’t cost you\r\nanything.”\r\n\r\nSolomin agreed, came out of the study, and began looking for his hat\r\nagain. But Nejdanov, who until that moment had had no opportunity of\r\nexchanging a word with him, came up to him and whispered hurriedly:\r\n\r\n“For heaven’s sake don’t go yet, or else we won’t be able to have a\r\ntalk!”\r\n\r\nSolomin left his hat alone, the more readily as Sipiagin, who had\r\nobserved his irresoluteness, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“Won’t you stay the night with us?”\r\n\r\n“As you wish.”\r\n\r\nThe grateful glance Mariana fixed on him as she stood at the\r\ndrawing-room window set him thinking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV\r\n\r\nUntil his visit Mariana had pictured Solomin to herself as quite\r\ndifferent. At first sight he had struck her as undefined, characterless.\r\nShe had seen many such fair, lean, sinewy men in her day, but the more\r\nshe watched him, the longer she listened to him, the stronger grew her\r\nfeeling of confidence in him—for it was confidence he inspired her\r\nwith. This calm, not exactly clumsy, but heavy man, was not only\r\nincapable of lying or bragging, but one could rely on him as on a stone\r\nwall. He would not betray one; more than that, he would understand and\r\nhelp one. It seemed to Mariana that he aroused such a feeling, not only\r\nin herself alone, but in everyone present. The things he spoke about had\r\nno particular interest for her. She attached very little significance\r\nto all this talk about factories and merchants, but the way in which\r\nhe spoke, the manner in which he looked round and smiled, pleased her\r\nimmensely.\r\n\r\nA straightforward man... at any rate! this was what appealed to her. It\r\nis a well-known fact, though not very easy to understand, that Russians\r\nare the greatest liars on the face of the earth, yet there is nothing\r\nthey respect more than truth, nothing they sympathise with more. And\r\nthen Solomin, in Mariana’s eyes, was surrounded by a particular halo, as\r\na man who had been recommended by Vassily Nikolaevitch himself. During\r\ndinner she had exchanged glances with Nejdanov several times on his\r\naccount, and in the end found herself involuntarily comparing the two,\r\nnot to Nejdanov’s advantage. Nejdanov’s face was, it is true, handsomer\r\nand pleasanter to look at than Solomin’s, but the very face expressed a\r\nmedley of troubled sensations: embarrassment, annoyance, impatience, and\r\neven dejection.\r\n\r\nHe seemed to be sitting on hot coals; tried to speak, but did not, and\r\nlaughed nervously. Solomin, on the other hand, seemed a little bored,\r\nbut looked quite at home and utterly independent of what was going on\r\naround him. “We must certainly ask advice of this man,” Mariana thought,\r\n“he is sure to tell us something useful.” It was she who had sent\r\nNejdanov to him after dinner.\r\n\r\nThe evening went very slowly; fortunately dinner was not over until late\r\nand not very long remained before bedtime. Kollomietzev was sulky and\r\nsaid nothing.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter with you?” Madame Sipiagina asked half-jestingly.\r\n“Have you lost anything?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I have,” Kollomietzev replied. “There is a story about a certain\r\nofficer in the lifeguards who was very much grieved that his soldiers\r\nhad lost a sock of his. ‘Find me my sock!’ he would say to them, and I\r\nsay, find me the word ‘sir!’ The word ‘sir’ is lost, and with it every\r\nsense of respect towards rank!”\r\n\r\nMadame Sipiagina informed Kollomietzev that she would not help him in\r\nthe search.\r\n\r\nEmboldened by the success of his speech at dinner, Sipiagin delivered\r\ntwo others, in which he let fly various statesmanlike reflections about\r\nindispensable measures and various words—_des mots_—not so much witty\r\nas weighty, which he had especially prepared for St. Petersburg. He even\r\nrepeated one of these words, saying beforehand, “If you will allow\r\nthe expression.” Above all, he declared that a certain minister had\r\nan “idle, unconcentrated mind,” and was given “to dreaming.” And not\r\nforgetting that one of his listener’s was a man of the people, he lost\r\nno opportunity in trying to show that he too was a Russian through\r\nand through, and steeped in the very root of the national life! For\r\ninstance, to Kollomietzev’s remark that the rain might interfere with\r\nthe haymaking, he replied, “If the hay is black, then the buckwheat will\r\nbe white;” then he made use of various proverbs like: “A store without\r\na master is an orphan,” “Look before you leap,” “When there’s bread then\r\nthere’s economy,” “If the birch leaves are as big as farthings by St.\r\nYegor’s day, the dough can be put into tubs by the feast of Our Lady\r\nof Kazan.” He sometimes went wrong, however, and would get his proverbs\r\nvery much mixed; but the society in which these little slips occurred\r\ndid not even suspect that _notre bon Russe_ had made a mistake, and,\r\nthanks to Prince Kovrishkin, it had got used to such little blunders.\r\nSipiagin pronounced all these proverbs in a peculiarly powerful, gruff\r\nvoice—_d’une voix rustique_. Similar sayings let loose at the proper time\r\nand place in St. Petersburg would cause influential high-society ladies\r\nto exclaim, _“Comme il connait bien les moeurs de notre people!”_ and\r\ngreat statesmen would add, _“Les moeurs et les besoins!”_\r\n\r\nValentina Mihailovna fussed about Solomin as much as she could, but\r\nher failure to arouse him disheartened her. On passing Kollomietzev\r\nshe said involuntarily, in an undertone: _“Mon Dieu, que je me sens\r\nfatiguée!”_ to which he replied with an ironical bow: _“Tu l’as voulu,\r\nGeorge Daudin!”_\r\n\r\nAt last, after the usual outburst of politeness and amiability, which\r\nappears on the faces of a bored assembly on the point of breaking up,\r\nafter sudden handshakings and friendly smiles, the weary guests and\r\nweary hosts separated.\r\n\r\nSolomin, who had been given almost the best bedroom on the second floor,\r\nwith English toilette accessories and a bathroom attached, went in to\r\nNejdanov.\r\n\r\nThe latter began by thanking him heartily for having agreed to stay.\r\n\r\n“I know it’s a sacrifice on your part—”\r\n\r\n“Not at all,” Solomin said hastily. “There was no sort of sacrifice\r\nrequired. Besides I couldn’t refuse you.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“Because I’ve taken a great liking to you.”\r\n\r\nNejdanov was surprised and glad at the same time, while Solomin pressed\r\nhis hand. Then he seated himself astride on a chair, lighted a cigar,\r\nand leaning both his elbows against the back, began:\r\n\r\n“Now tell me what’s the matter.”\r\n\r\nNejdanov also seated himself astride on a chair in front of Solomin, but\r\ndid not light a cigar.\r\n\r\n“So you want to know what’s the matter.... The fact is, I want to run\r\naway from here.”\r\n\r\n“Am I to understand that you want to leave this house? As far as I can\r\nsee there is nothing to prevent you.”\r\n\r\n“Not leave it, but run away from it.”\r\n\r\n“Why? Do they want to detain you? Perhaps you’ve taken some money\r\nin advance.... If so, you’ve only to say the word and I should be\r\ndelighted——”\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid you don’t understand me, my dear Solomin. I said run away\r\nand not leave, because I’m not going away alone.”\r\n\r\nSolomin raised his head.\r\n\r\n“With whom then?”\r\n\r\n“With the girl you’ve seen here today.”\r\n\r\n“With her! She has a very nice face. Are you in love with one another?\r\nOr have you simply decided to go away together because you don’t like\r\nbeing here?”\r\n\r\n“We love each other.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” Solomin was silent for a while. “Is she related to the people\r\nhere?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. But she fully shares our convictions and is prepared for\r\nanything.”\r\n\r\nSolomin smiled.\r\n\r\n“And you, Nejdanov, are you prepared?”\r\n\r\nNejdanov frowned slightly.\r\n\r\n“Why ask? You will see when the time comes.”\r\n\r\n“I do not doubt you, Nejdanov. I only asked because it seemed to me that\r\nbesides yourself nobody else was prepared.”\r\n\r\n“And Markelov?”\r\n\r\n“Why, of course, Markelov! But then, he was born prepared.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment someone knocked at the door gently, but hastily, and\r\nopened it without waiting for an answer. It was Mariana. She immediately\r\ncame up to Solomin.\r\n\r\n“I feel sure,” she began, “that you are not surprised at seeing me here\r\nat this time of night. He” (Mariana pointed to Nejdanov) “has no doubt\r\ntold you everything. Give me your hand, please, and believe me an honest\r\ngirl is standing before you.”\r\n\r\n“I am convinced of that,” Solomin said seriously.\r\n\r\nHe had risen from his chair as soon as Mariana had appeared. “I had\r\nalready noticed you at table and was struck by the frank expression of\r\nyour eyes. Nejdanov told me about your intentions. But may I ask why you\r\nwant to run away.”\r\n\r\n“What a question! The cause with which I am fully in sympathy ... don’t\r\nbe surprised. Nejdanov has kept nothing from me.... The great work is\r\nabout to begin ... and am I to remain in this house, where everything is\r\ndeceit and falsehood? People I love will be exposed to danger, and I——”\r\n\r\nSolomin stopped her by a wave of the hand.\r\n\r\n“Calm yourself. Sit down, please, and you sit down too, Nejdanov. Let us\r\nall sit down. Listen to me! If you have no other reason than the one\r\nyou have mentioned, then there’s no need for you to run away as yet.\r\nThe work will not begin so soon as you seem to anticipate. A little more\r\nprudent consideration is needed in this matter. It’s no good plunging in\r\ntoo soon, believe me.”\r\n\r\nMariana sat down and wrapped herself up in a large plaid, which she had\r\nthrown over her shoulders.\r\n\r\n“But I can’t stay here any longer! I am being insulted by everybody.\r\nOnly today that idiot Anna Zaharovna said before Kolia, alluding to my\r\nfather, that a bad tree does not bring forth good fruit! Kolia was\r\neven surprised, and asked what it meant. Not to speak of Valentina\r\nMihailovna!”\r\n\r\nSolomin stopped her again, this time with a smile.\r\n\r\nMariana felt that he was laughing at her a little, but this smile could\r\nnot have offended any one.\r\n\r\n“But, my dear lady, I don’t know who Anna Zaharovna is, nor what tree\r\nyou are talking about. A foolish woman says some foolish things to you\r\nand you can’t endure it! How will you live in that case? The whole\r\nworld is composed of fools. Your reason is not good enough. Have you any\r\nother?”\r\n\r\n“I am convinced,” Nejdanov interposed in a hollow voice, “that Mr.\r\nSipiagin will turn me out of the house tomorrow of his own accord.\r\nSomeone must have told him. He treats me... in the most contemptuous\r\nmanner.”\r\n\r\nSolomin turned to Nejdanov.\r\n\r\n“If that’s the case, then why run away?”\r\n\r\nNejdanov did not know what to say.\r\n\r\n“But I’ve already told you—,” he began.\r\n\r\n“He said that,” Mariana put in, “because I am going with him.”\r\n\r\nSolomin looked at her and shook his head good-naturedly.\r\n\r\n“In that case, my dear lady, I say again, that if you want to leave here\r\nbecause you think the revolution is about to break out—”\r\n\r\n“That was precisely why we asked you to come,” Mariana interrupted him;\r\n“we wanted to find out exactly how matters stood.”\r\n\r\n“If that’s your reason for going,” Solomin continued, “I repeat once\r\nmore, you can stay at home for some time to come yet, but if you want\r\nto run away because you love each other and can’t be united otherwise,\r\nthen—”\r\n\r\n“Well? What then?”\r\n\r\n“Then I must first congratulate you and, if need be, give you all the\r\nhelp in my power. I may say, my dear lady, that I took a liking to you\r\nboth at first sight and love you as brother and sister.”\r\n\r\nMariana and Nejdanov both went up to him on the right and left and each\r\nclasped a hand.\r\n\r\n“Only tell us what to do,” Mariana implored. “Supposing the revolution\r\nis still far off, there must be preparatory work to be done, a thing\r\nimpossible in this house, in the midst of these surroundings. We should\r\nso gladly go together.... Show us what we can do; tell us where to\r\ngo.... Send us anywhere you like! You will send us, won’t you?”\r\n\r\n“Where to?”\r\n\r\n“To the people.... Where can one go if not among the people?”\r\n\r\n“Into the forest,” Nejdanov thought, calling to mind Paklin’s words.\r\n\r\nSolomin looked intently at Mariana.\r\n\r\n“Do you want to know the people?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; that is, we not only want to get to know them, but we want to\r\nwork... to toil for them.”\r\n\r\n“Very well. I promise you that you shall get to know them. I will give\r\nyou the opportunity of doing as you wish. And you, Nejdanov, are you\r\nready to go for her... and for them?”\r\n\r\n“Of course I am,” he said hastily. “Juggernaut,” another word of\r\nPaklin’s, flashed across his mind. “Here it comes thundering along, the\r\nhuge chariot.... I can hear the crash and rumble of its wheels.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” Solomin repeated pensively. “But when do you want to go\r\naway?”\r\n\r\n“Tomorrow, if possible,” Mariana observed.\r\n\r\n“Very good. But where?”\r\n\r\n“Sh, sh—” Nejdanov whispered. “Someone is walking along the corridor.”\r\n\r\nThey were all silent for a time.\r\n\r\n“But where do you want to go to?” Solomin asked again, lowering his\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n“We don’t know,” Mariana replied.\r\n\r\nSolomin glanced at Nejdanov, but the latter merely shook his head.\r\n\r\nSolomin stretched out his hand and carefully snuffed the candle.\r\n\r\n“I tell you what, my children,” he said at last, “come to me at the\r\nfactory. It’s not beautiful there, but safe, at any rate. I will hide\r\nyou. I have a little spare room there. Nobody will find you. If only you\r\nget there, we won’t give you up. You might think that there are far too\r\nmany people about, but that’s one of its good points. Where there is a\r\ncrowd it’s easy to hide. Will you come? Will you?”\r\n\r\n“How can we thank you enough!” Nejdanov exclaimed, whilst Mariana, who\r\nwas at first a little taken aback by the idea of the factory, added\r\nquickly:\r\n\r\n“Of course, of course! How good of you! But you won’t leave us there\r\nlong, will you? You will send us on, won’t you?”\r\n\r\n“That will depend entirely on yourselves.... If you should want to get\r\nmarried that could also be arranged at the factory. I have a neighbour\r\nthere close by—a cousin of mine, a priest, and very friendly. He would\r\nmarry you with the greatest of pleasure.”\r\n\r\nMariana smiled to herself, while Nejdanov again pressed Solomin’s hand.\r\n\r\n“But I say, won’t your employer, the owner of the factory, be annoyed\r\nabout it. Won’t he make it unpleasant for you?” he asked after a pause.\r\n\r\nSolomin looked askance at Nejdanov.\r\n\r\n“Oh, don’t bother about me! It’s quite unnecessary. So long as things at\r\nthe factory go on all right it’s all the same to my employer. You need\r\nneither of you fear the least unpleasantness. And you need not be afraid\r\nof the workpeople either. Only let me know what time to expect you.”\r\n\r\nNejdanov and Mariana exchanged glances.\r\n\r\n“The day after tomorrow, early in the morning, or the day after that. We\r\ncan’t wait any longer. As likely as not they’ll tell me to go tomorrow.”\r\n\r\n“Well then,” Solomin said, rising from his chair. “I’ll wait for you\r\nevery morning. I won’t leave the place for the rest of the week. Every\r\nprecaution will be taken.”\r\n\r\nMariana drew near to him (she was on her way to the door). “Goodbye, my\r\ndear kind Vassily Fedotitch... that is your name, isn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“That’s right.”\r\n\r\n“Goodbye till we meet again. And thank you so much!”\r\n\r\n“Goodbye, good night!”\r\n\r\n“Goodbye, Nejdanov; till tomorrow,” she added, and went out quickly.\r\n\r\nThe young men remained for some time motionless, and both were silent.\r\n\r\n“Nejdanov...” Solomin began at last, and stopped. “Nejdanov...” he began\r\na second time, “tell me about this girl... tell me everything you can.\r\nWhat has her life been until now? Who is she? Why is she here?”\r\n\r\nNejdanov told Solomin briefly what he knew about her. “Nejdanov,”\r\n he said at last, “you must take great care of her, because... if...\r\nanything... were to happen, you would be very much to blame. Goodbye.”\r\n\r\nHe went out, while Nejdanov stood still for a time in the middle of the\r\nroom, and muttering, “Oh dear! It’s better not to think!” threw himself\r\nface downwards on the bed.\r\n\r\nWhen Mariana returned to her room she found a note on the table\r\ncontaining the following:\r\n\r\n“I am sorry for you. You are ruining yourself. Think what you are doing.\r\nInto what abysses are you throwing yourself with your eyes shut. For\r\nwhom and for what?—V.”\r\n\r\nThere was a peculiarly fine fresh scent in the room; evidently\r\nValentina Mihailovna had only just left it. Mariana took a pen and wrote\r\nunderneath: “You need not be sorry for me. God knows which of us two\r\nis more in need of pity. I only know that I wouldn’t like to be in your\r\nplace for worlds.—M.” She put the note on the table, not doubting that\r\nit would fall into Valentina Mihailovna’s hand.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning, Solomin, after seeing Nejdanov and definitely\r\ndeclining to undertake the management of Sipiagin’s factory, set out for\r\nhome. He mused all the way home, a thing that rarely occurred with\r\nhim; the motion of the carriage usually had a drowsy effect on him. He\r\nthought of Mariana and of Nejdanov; it seemed to him that if he had been\r\nin love—he, Solomin—he would have had quite a different air, would\r\nhave looked and spoken differently. “But,” he thought, “such a thing has\r\nnever happened to me, so I can’t tell what sort of an air I would have.”\r\n He recalled an Irish girl whom he had once seen in a shop behind a\r\ncounter; recalled her wonderful black hair, blue eyes, and thick lashes,\r\nand how she had looked at him with a sad, wistful expression, and how he\r\nhad paced up and down the street before her window for a long time, how\r\nexcited he had been, and had kept asking himself if he should try and\r\nget to know her. He was in London at the time, where he had been sent\r\nby his employer with a sum of money to make various purchases. He very\r\nnearly decided to remain in London and send back the money, so strong\r\nwas the impression produced on him by the beautiful Polly. (He had got\r\nto know her name, one of the other girls had called her by it.) He had\r\nmastered himself, however, and went back to his employer. Polly was more\r\nbeautiful than Mariana, but Mariana had the same sad, wistful expression\r\nin her eyes... and Mariana was a Russian.\r\n\r\n“But what am I doing?” Solomin exclaimed in an undertone, “bothering\r\nabout other men’s brides!” and he shook back the collar of his coat, as\r\nif he wanted to shake off all superfluous thoughts. Just then he drove\r\nup to the factory and caught sight of the faithful Pavel in the doorway\r\nof his little dwelling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI\r\n\r\nSolomin’s refusal greatly offended Sipiagin; so much so, that he\r\nsuddenly found that this home-bred Stevenson was not such a wonderful\r\nengineer after all, and that though he was not perhaps a complete\r\nposer, yet gave himself airs like the plebeian he was. “All these\r\nRussians when they imagine they know a thing become insufferable! _Au\r\nfond_ Kollomietzev was right!” Under the influence of such hostile\r\nand irritable sensations, the statesman—_en herbe_—was even more\r\nunsympathetic and distant in his intercourse with Nejdanov. He told\r\nKolia that he need not take lessons that day and that he must try to\r\nbe more independent in future. He did not, however, dismiss the tutor\r\nhimself as the latter had expected, but continued to ignore him. But\r\nValentina Mihailovna did not ignore Mariana. A dreadful scene took\r\nplace between them.\r\n\r\nAbout two hours before dinner they suddenly found themselves alone in\r\nthe drawing-room. They both felt that the inevitable moment for the\r\nbattle had arrived and, after a moment’s hesitation, instinctively drew\r\nnear to one another. Valentina Mihailovna was slightly smiling, Mariana\r\npressed her lips firmly together; both were pale. When walking across\r\nthe room, Valentina Mihailovna looked uneasily to the right and left\r\nand tore off a geranium leaf. Mariana’s eyes were fixed straight on the\r\nsmiling face coming towards her. Madame Sipiagina was the first to stop,\r\nand drumming her finger-tips on the back of a chair began in a free and\r\neasy tone:\r\n\r\n“Mariana Vikentievna, it seems that we have entered upon a\r\ncorrespondence with one another.... Living under the same roof as we do\r\nit strikes me as being rather strange. And you know I am not very fond\r\nof strange things.”\r\n\r\n“I did not begin the correspondence, Valentina Mihailovna.”\r\n\r\n“That is true. As it happens, I am to blame in that. Only I could not\r\nthink of any other means of arousing in you a feeling... how shall I\r\nsay? A feeling—”\r\n\r\n“You can speak quite plainly, Valentina Mihailovna. You need not be\r\nafraid of offending me.”\r\n\r\n“A feeling... of propriety.”\r\n\r\nValentina Mihailovna ceased; nothing but the drumming of her fingers\r\ncould be heard in the room.\r\n\r\n“In what way do you think I have failed to observe the rules of\r\npropriety?” Mariana asked.\r\n\r\nValentina Mihailovna shrugged her shoulders.\r\n\r\n“_Ma chère, vous n’êtes plus un enfant_—I think you know what I mean. Do\r\nyou suppose that your behaviour could have remained a secret to me, to\r\nAnna Zaharovna, to the whole household in fact? However, I must say you\r\nare not over-particular about secrecy. You simply acted in bravado. Only\r\nBoris Andraevitch does not know what you have done.... But he is occupied\r\nwith far more serious and important matters. Apart from him, everybody\r\nelse knows, everybody!”\r\n\r\nMariana’s pallor increased.\r\n\r\n“I must ask you to express yourself more clearly, Valentina Mihailovna.\r\nWhat is it you are displeased about?”\r\n\r\n_“L’insolente!”_ Madame Sipiagina thought, but contained herself.\r\n\r\n“Do you want to know why I am displeased with you, Mariana? Then I must\r\ntell you that I disapprove of your prolonged interviews with a young man\r\nwho is very much beneath you in birth, breeding, and social position.\r\nI am displeased... no! this word is far too mild—I am shocked at your\r\nlate... your night visits to this young man! And where does it happen?\r\nUnder my own roof! Perhaps you see nothing wrong in it and think that\r\nit has nothing to do with me, that I should be silent and thereby screen\r\nyour disgraceful conduct. As an honourable woman... _oui, mademoiselle,\r\nje l’ai été, je le suis, et je le serai toujours!_ I can’t help being\r\nhorrified at such proceedings!”\r\n\r\nValentina Mihailovna threw herself into an armchair as if overcome by\r\nher indignation. Mariana smiled for the first time.\r\n\r\n“I do not doubt your honour—past, present, and to come,” she began;\r\n“and I mean this quite sincerely. Your indignation is needless. I have\r\nbrought no shame on your house. The young man whom you alluded to...\r\nyes, I have certainly... fallen in love with him.”\r\n\r\n“You love Mr. Nejdanov?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I love him.”\r\n\r\nValentina Mihailovna sat up straight in her chair.\r\n\r\n“But, Mariana! he’s only a student, of no birth, no family, and he\r\nis younger than you are!” (These words were pronounced not without a\r\ncertain spiteful pleasure.) “What earthly good can come of it? What do\r\nyou see in him? He is only an empty-headed boy.”\r\n\r\n“That was not always your opinion of him, Valentina Mihailovna.”\r\n\r\n“For heaven’s sake leave me out of the question, my dear!.... _Pas tant\r\nd’esprit que ça, je vous prie._ The thing concerns you and your future.\r\nJust consider for a moment. What sort of a match is this for you?”\r\n\r\n“I must confess, Valentina Mihailovna, that I did not look at it in that\r\nlight.”\r\n\r\n“What? What did you say? What am I to think? Let us assume that you\r\nfollowed the dictates of your heart, but then it must end in marriage\r\nsometime or other.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know... I had not thought of that.”\r\n\r\n“You had not thought of that? You must be mad!”\r\n\r\nMariana turned away.\r\n\r\n“Let us make an end of this conversation, Valentina Mihailovna. It won’t\r\nlead to anything. In any case we won’t understand each other.”\r\n\r\nValentina Mihailovna started up.\r\n\r\n“I can’t, I won’t put an end to this conversation! It’s far too\r\nserious.... I am responsible for you before...”\r\n\r\nValentina Mihailovna was going to say God, but hesitated and added,\r\n“before the whole world! I can’t be silent when I hear such utter\r\nmadness! And why can’t I understand you, pray? What insufferable pride\r\nthese young people have nowadays! On the contrary, I understand you only\r\ntoo well... I can see that you are infected with these new ideas, which\r\nwill only be your ruin. It will be too late to turn back then.”\r\n\r\n“Maybe; but believe me, even if we perish, we will not so much as\r\nstretch out a finger that you might save us!”\r\n\r\n“Pride again! This awful pride! But listen, Mariana, listen to me,” she\r\nadded, suddenly changing her tone. She wanted to draw Mariana nearer\r\nto herself, but the latter stepped back a pace. _“Ecoutez-moi, je vous\r\nen conjure!_ After all, I am not so old nor so stupid that it should\r\nbe impossible for us to understand each other! _Je ne suis pas une\r\nencroûtée._ I was even considered a republican as a girl ... no less\r\nthan you. Listen, I won’t pretend that I ever had any motherly feeling\r\ntowards you... and it is not in your nature to complain of that....\r\nBut I always felt, and feel now, that I owed certain duties towards\r\nyou, and I have always endeavoured to fulfil them. Perhaps the match I\r\nhad in my mind for you, for which both Boris Andraevitch and I would\r\nhave been ready to make any sacrifice ... may not have been fully in\r\naccordance with your ideas ... but in the bottom of my heart—”\r\n\r\nMariana looked at Valentina Mihailovna, at her wonderful eyes, her\r\nslightly painted lips, at her white hands, the parted fingers adorned\r\nwith rings, which the elegant lady so energetically pressed against the\r\nbodice of her silk dress.... Suddenly she interrupted her.\r\n\r\n“Did you say a match, Valentina Mihailovna? Do you call that heartless,\r\nvulgar friend of yours, Mr. Kollomietzev, ‘a match?’”\r\n\r\nValentina Mihailovna took her fingers from her bodice. “Yes, Mariana\r\nVikentievna! I am speaking of that cultured, excellent young man, Mr.\r\nKollomietzev, who would make a wife happy and whom only a mad-woman\r\ncould refuse! Yes, only a mad-woman!”\r\n\r\n“What can I do, _ma tante_? It seems that I am mad!”\r\n\r\n“Have you anything serious against him?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing whatever. I simply despise him.” Valentina Mihailovna shook her\r\nhead impatiently and dropped into her chair again.\r\n\r\n“Let us leave him. _Retournons à nos moutons._ And so you love Mr.\r\nNejdanov?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“And do you intend to continue your interviews with him?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“But supposing I forbid it?”\r\n\r\n“I won’t listen to you.”\r\n\r\nValentina Mihailovna sprang up from her chair.\r\n\r\n“What! You won’t listen to me! I see.... And that is said to me by a\r\ngirl who has known nothing but kindness from me, whom I have brought up\r\nin my own house, that is said to me ... said to me——”\r\n\r\n“By the daughter of a disgraced father,” Mariana put in, sternly. “Go\r\non, don’t be on ceremonies!”\r\n\r\n_“Ce n’est pas moi qui vous le fait dire, mademoiselle!_ In any case,\r\n_that_ is nothing to be proud of! A girl who lives at my expense——”\r\n\r\n“Don’t throw that in my face, Valentina Mihailovna! It would cost you\r\nmore to keep a French governess for Kolia.... It is I who give him\r\nFrench lessons!”\r\n\r\nValentina Mihailovna raised a hand holding a scented cambric\r\npocket-handkerchief with a large white monogram embroidered in one\r\ncorner and tried to say something, but Mariana continued passionately:\r\n\r\n“You would have been right, a thousand times right, if, instead of\r\ncounting up all your petty benefits and sacrifices, you could have been\r\nin a position to say ‘the girl I loved’ ... but you are too honest to lie\r\nabout that!” Mariana trembled feverishly. “You have always hated me. And\r\neven now you are glad in the bottom of your heart—that same heart\r\nyou have just mentioned—glad that I am justifying your constant\r\npredictions, covering myself with shame and scandal—you are only\r\nannoyed because part of this shame is bound to fall on your virtuous,\r\naristocratic house!”\r\n\r\n“You are insulting me,” Valentina Mihailovna whispered. “Be kind enough\r\nto leave the room!”\r\n\r\nBut Mariana could no longer contain herself. “Your household, you said,\r\nall your household, Anna Zaharovna and everybody knows of my behaviour!\r\nAnd every one is horrified and indignant.... But am I asking anything of\r\nyou, of all these people? Do you think I care for their good opinion?\r\nDo you think that eating your bread has been sweet? I would prefer the\r\ngreatest poverty to this luxury. There is a gulf between me and\r\nyour house, an interminable gulf that cannot be crossed. You are an\r\nintelligent woman, don’t you feel it too? And if you hate me, what do\r\nyou think I feel towards you? We won’t go into unnecessary details, it’s\r\ntoo obvious.”\r\n\r\n_“Sortez, sortez, vous dis-je ...”_ Valentina Mihailovna repeated, stamping\r\nher pretty little foot.\r\n\r\nMariana took a few steps towards the door.\r\n\r\n“I will rid you of my presence directly, only do you know what,\r\nValentina Mihailovna? They say that in Racine’s ‘Bajazet’ even Rachel’s\r\n_sortez!_ was not effective, and you don’t come anywhere near her!\r\nThen, what was it you said ... _Je suis une honnête femme, je l’ai été\r\net le serai toujours?_ But I am convinced that I am far more honest\r\nthan you are! Goodbye!”\r\n\r\nMariana went out quickly and Valentina Mihailovna sprang up from her\r\nchair. She wanted to scream, to cry, but did not know what to scream\r\nabout, and the tears would not come at her bidding.\r\n\r\nSo she fanned herself with her pocket-handkerchief, but the strong scent\r\nof it affected her nerves still more. She felt miserable, insulted....\r\nShe was conscious of a certain amount of truth in what she had just\r\nheard, but how could anyone be so unjust to her? “Am I really so bad?”\r\n she thought, and looked at herself in a mirror hanging opposite between\r\ntwo windows. The looking-glass reflected a charming face, somewhat\r\nexcited, the colour coming and going, but still a fascinating face, with\r\nwonderful soft, velvety eyes....\r\n\r\n“I? I am bad?” she thought again.... “With such eyes?”\r\n\r\nBut at this moment her husband entered the room and she again covered\r\nher face with her pocket-handkerchief.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter with you?” he asked anxiously. “What is the matter,\r\nValia?” (He had invented this pet name, but only allowed himself to use\r\nit when they were quite alone, particularly in the country.)\r\n\r\nAt first she declared that there was nothing the matter, but ended by\r\nturning around in her chair in a very charming and touching manner and,\r\nflinging her arms round his shoulders (he stood bending over her) and\r\nhiding her face in the slit of his waistcoat, told him everything.\r\nWithout any hypocrisy or any interested motive on her part, she tried\r\nto excuse Mariana as much as she could, putting all the blame on her\r\nextreme youth, her passionate temperament, and the defects of her early\r\neducation. In the same way she also, without any hidden motive, blamed\r\nherself a great deal, saying, “With a daughter of mine this would\r\nnever have happened! I would have looked after her quite differently!”\r\n Sipiagin listened to her indulgently, sympathetically, but with a severe\r\nexpression on his face. He continued standing in a stooping position\r\nwithout moving his head so long as she held her arms round his\r\nshoulders; he called her an angel, kissed her on the forehead, declared\r\nthat he now knew what course he must pursue as head of the house,\r\nand went out, carrying himself like an energetic humane man, who was\r\nconscious of having to perform an unpleasant but necessary duty.\r\n\r\nAt eight o’clock, after dinner, Nejdanov was sitting in his room writing\r\nto his friend Silin.\r\n\r\n“MY DEAR VLADIMIR,—I write to you at a critical moment of my life. I\r\nhave been dismissed from this house, I am going away from here. That in\r\nitself would be nothing—I am not going alone. The girl I wrote to you\r\nabout is coming with me. We are drawn together by the similarity of our\r\nfate in life, by our loneliness, convictions, aspirations, and, above\r\nall, by our mutual love. Yes, we love each other. I am convinced that\r\nI could not experience the passion of love in any other form than that\r\nwhich presents itself to me now. But I should not be speaking the\r\ntruth if I were to say that I had no mysterious fear, no misgivings at\r\nheart.... Everything in front of us is enveloped in darkness and we are\r\nplunging into that darkness. I need not tell you what we are going\r\nfor and what we have chosen to do. Mariana and I are not in search of\r\nhappiness or vain delight; we want to enter the fight together, side by\r\nside, supporting each other. Our aim is clear to us, but we do not know\r\nthe roads that lead to it. Shall we find, if not help and sympathy at\r\nany rate, the opportunity to work? Mariana is a wonderfully honest girl.\r\nShould we be fated to perish, I will not blame myself for having enticed\r\nher away, because now no other life is possible for her. But, Vladimir,\r\nVladimir! I feel so miserable.... I am torn by doubt, not in my feelings\r\ntowards her, of course, but ... I do not know! And it is too late to turn\r\nback. Stretch out your hands to us from afar, and wish us patience, the\r\npower of self-sacrifice, and love... most of all love. And ye, Russian\r\npeople, unknown to us, but beloved by us with all the force of our\r\nbeings, with our hearts’ blood, receive us in your midst, be kind to us,\r\nand teach us what we may expect from you. Goodbye, Vladimir, goodbye!”\r\n\r\nHaving finished these few lines Nejdanov set out for the village.\r\n\r\nThe following night, before daybreak, he stood on the outskirts of the\r\nbirch grove, not far from Sipiagin’s garden. A little further on behind\r\nthe tangled branches of a nut-bush stood a peasant cart harnessed to\r\na pair of unbridled horses. Inside, under the seat of plaited rope, a\r\nlittle grey old peasant was lying asleep on a bundle of hay, covered up\r\nto the ears with an old patched coat. Nejdanov kept looking eagerly at\r\nthe road, at the clumps of laburnums at the bottom of the garden; the\r\nstill grey night lay around; the little stars did their best to outshine\r\none another and were lost in the vast expanse of sky. To the east the\r\nrounded edges of the spreading clouds were tinged with a faint flush of\r\ndawn. Suddenly Nejdanov trembled and became alert. Something squeaked\r\nnear by, the opening of a gate was heard; a tiny feminine creature,\r\nwrapped up in a shawl with a bundle slung over her bare arm, walked\r\nslowly out of the deep shadow of the laburnums into the dusty road,\r\nand crossing over as if on tip-toe, turned towards the grove. Nejdanov\r\nrushed towards her.\r\n\r\n“Mariana?” he whispered.\r\n\r\n“It’s I!” came a soft reply from under the shawl.\r\n\r\n“This way, come with me,” Nejdanov responded, seizing her awkwardly by\r\nthe bare arm, holding the bundle.\r\n\r\nShe trembled as if with cold. He led her up to the cart and woke the\r\npeasant. The latter jumped up quickly, instantly took his seat on the\r\nbox, put his arms into the coat sleeves, and seized the rope that served\r\nas reins. The horses moved; he encouraged them cautiously in a voice\r\nstill hoarse from a heavy sleep. Nejdanov placed Mariana on the seat,\r\nfirst spreading out his cloak for her to sit on, wrapped her feet in a\r\nrug, as the hay was rather damp, and sitting down beside her, gave the\r\norder to start. The peasant pulled the reins, the horses came out of\r\nthe grove, snorting and shaking themselves, and bumping and rattling its\r\nsmall wheels the cart rolled out on to the road. Nejdanov had his\r\narm round Mariana’s waist, while she, raising the shawl with her cold\r\nfingers and turning her smiling face towards him, exclaimed: “How\r\nbeautifully fresh the air is, Aliosha!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” the peasant replied, “there’ll be a heavy dew!”\r\n\r\nThere was already such a heavy dew that the axles of the cart wheels as\r\nthey caught in the tall grass along the roadside shook off whole showers\r\nof tiny drops and the grass looked silver-grey.\r\n\r\nMariana again trembled from the cold.\r\n\r\n“How cold it is!” she said gaily. “But freedom, Aliosha, freedom!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII\r\n\r\nSolomin rushed out to the factory gates as soon as he was informed that\r\nsome sort of gentleman, with a lady, who had arrived in a cart, was\r\nasking for him. Without a word of greeting to his visitors, merely\r\nnodding his head to them several times, he told the peasant to drive\r\ninto the yard, and asking him to stop before his own little dwelling,\r\nhelped Mariana out of the cart. Nejdanov jumped out after her. Solomin\r\nconducted them both through a long dark passage, up a narrow, crooked\r\nlittle staircase at the back of the house, up to the second floor. He\r\nopened a door and they all went into a tiny neat little room with two\r\nwindows.\r\n\r\n“I’m so glad you’ve come!” Solomin exclaimed, with his habitual smile,\r\nwhich now seemed even broader and brighter than usual.\r\n\r\n“Here are your rooms. This one and another adjoining it. Not much to\r\nlook at, but never mind, one can live here and there’s no one to spy\r\non you. Just under your window there is what my employer calls a flower\r\ngarden, but which I should call a kitchen garden. It lies right up\r\nagainst the wall and there are hedges to right and left. A quiet little\r\nspot. Well, how are you, my dear lady? And how are you, Nejdanov?”\r\n\r\nHe shook hands with them both. They stood motionless, not taking off\r\ntheir things, and with silent, half-bewildered, half-joyful emotion\r\ngazed straight in front of them.\r\n\r\n“Well? Why don’t you take your things off?” Solomin asked. “Have you\r\nmuch luggage?”\r\n\r\nMariana held up her little bundle.\r\n\r\n“I have only this.”\r\n\r\n“I have a portmanteau and a bag, which I left in the cart. I’ll go\r\nand—”\r\n\r\n“Don’t bother, don’t bother.” Solomin opened the door. “Pavel!” he\r\nshouted down the dark staircase, “run and fetch the things from the\r\ncart!”\r\n\r\n“All right!” answered the never-failing Pavel.\r\n\r\nSolomin turned to Mariana, who had taken off her shawl and was\r\nunfastening her cloak.\r\n\r\n“Did everything go off happily?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Quite... not a soul saw us. I left a letter for Madame Sipiagina.\r\nVassily Fedotitch, I didn’t bring any clothes with me, because\r\nyou’re going to send us...” (Mariana wanted to say to the people, but\r\nhesitated). “They wouldn’t have been of any use in any case. I have\r\nmoney to buy what is necessary.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll see to that later on.... Ah!” he exclaimed, pointing to Pavel who\r\nwas at that moment coming in together with Nejdanov and the luggage from\r\nthe cart, “I can recommend you my best friend here. You may rely on\r\nhim absolutely, as you would on me. Have you told Tatiana about the\r\nsamovar?” he added in an undertone.\r\n\r\n“It will soon be ready,” Pavel replied; “and cream and everything.”\r\n\r\n“Tatiana is Pavel’s wife and just as reliable as he is,” Solomin\r\ncontinued. “Until you get used to things, my dear lady, she will look\r\nafter you.”\r\n\r\nMariana flung her cloak on to a couch covered with leather, which was\r\nstanding in a corner of the room.\r\n\r\n“Will you please call me Mariana, Vassily Fedotitch; I don’t want to be\r\na lady, neither do I want servants.... I did not go away from there to\r\nbe waited on. Don’t look at my dress—I hadn’t any other. I must change\r\nall that now.”\r\n\r\nHer dress of fine brown cloth was very simple, but made by a St.\r\nPetersburg dressmaker. It fitted beautifully round her waist and\r\nshoulders and had altogether a fashionable air.\r\n\r\n“Well, not a servant if you like, but a help, in the American fashion.\r\nBut you must have some tea. It’s early yet, but you are both tired, no\r\ndoubt. I have to be at the factory now on business, but will look in\r\nlater on. If you want anything, ask Pavel or Tatiana.”\r\n\r\nMariana held out both her hands to him quickly.\r\n\r\n“How can we thank you enough, Vassily Fedotitch?” She looked at him with\r\nemotion. Solomin stroked one of her hands gently. “I should say it’s\r\nnot worth thanking for, but that wouldn’t be true. I had better say\r\nthat your thanks give me the greatest of pleasure. So we are quits. Good\r\nmorning. Come along, Pavel.”\r\n\r\nMariana and Nejdanov were left alone.\r\n\r\nShe rushed up to him and looked at him with the same expression with\r\nwhich she had looked at Solomin, only with even greater delight,\r\nemotion, radiance: “Oh, my dear!” she exclaimed. “We are beginning a new\r\nlife... at last! At last! You can’t believe how this poor little room,\r\nwhere we are to spend a few days, seems sweet and charming compared to\r\nthose hateful palaces! Are you glad?”\r\n\r\nNejdanov took her hands and pressed them against his breast.\r\n\r\n“I am happy, Mariana, to begin this new life with you! You will be my\r\nguiding star, my support, my strength—”\r\n\r\n“Dear, darling Aliosha! But stop—we must wash and tidy ourselves a\r\nlittle. I will go into my room... and you... stay here. I won’t be a\r\nminute—”\r\n\r\nMariana went into the other room and shut the door. A minute later she\r\nopened it half-way and, putting her head through, said: “Isn’t Solomin\r\nnice!” Then she shut the door again and the key turned in the lock.\r\n\r\nNejdanov went up to the window and looked out into the garden.... One\r\nold, very old, apple tree particularly attracted his attention. He shook\r\nhimself, stretched, opened his portmanteau, but took nothing out of it;\r\nhe became lost in thought....\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour later Mariana returned with a beaming,\r\nfreshly-washed face, brimming over with gaiety, and a few minutes later\r\nTatiana, Pavel’s wife, appeared with the samovar, tea things, rolls, and\r\ncream.\r\n\r\nIn striking contrast to her gipsy-like husband she was a typical\r\nRussian—buxom, with masses of flaxen hair, which she wore in a\r\nthick plait twisted round a horn comb. She had coarse though pleasant\r\nfeatures, good-natured grey eyes, and was dressed in a very neat though\r\nsomewhat faded print dress. Her hands were clean and well-shaped,\r\nthough large. She bowed composedly, greeted them in a firm, clear\r\naccent without any sing-song about it, and set to work arranging the tea\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nMariana went up to her.\r\n\r\n“Let me help you, Tatiana. Only give me a napkin.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t bother, miss, we are used to it. Vassily Fedotitch told me to.\r\nIf you want anything please let us know. We shall be delighted to do\r\nanything we can.”\r\n\r\n“Please don’t call me miss, Tatiana. I am dressed like a lady, but I\r\nam... I am quite—”\r\n\r\nTatiana’s penetrating glance disconcerted Mariana; she ceased.\r\n\r\n“And what are you then?” Tatiana asked in her steady voice.\r\n\r\n“If you really want to know... I am certainly a lady by birth. But I\r\nwant to get rid of all that. I want to become like all simple women.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I see! You want to become simplified, like so many do nowadays.”\r\n\r\n“What did you say, Tatiana? To become simplified?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that’s a word that has sprung up among us. To become simplified\r\nmeans to be like the common people. Teaching the people is all very\r\nwell in its way, but it must be a difficult task, very difficult! I hope\r\nyou’ll get on.”\r\n\r\n“To become simplified!” Mariana repeated. “Do you hear, Aliosha, you and\r\nI have now become simplified!”\r\n\r\n“Is he your husband or your brother?” Tatiana asked, carefully washing\r\nthe cups with her large, skilful hands as she looked from one to the\r\nother with a kindly smile.\r\n\r\n“No,” Mariana replied; “he is neither my husband nor my brother.”\r\n\r\nTatiana raised her head.\r\n\r\n“Then you are just living together freely? That also happens very often\r\nnow. At one time it was to be met with only among nonconformists, but\r\nnowadays other folks do it too. Where there is God’s blessing you can\r\nlive in peace without the priest’s aid. We have some living like that at\r\nthe factory. Not the worst of folk either.”\r\n\r\n“What nice words you use, Tatiana! ‘Living together freely’... I like\r\nthat. I’ll tell you what I want to ask of you, Tatiana. I want to make\r\nor buy a dress, something like yours, only a little plainer. Then I want\r\nshoes and stockings and a kerchief—everything like you have. I’ve got\r\nsome money.”\r\n\r\n“That’s quite easy, miss.... There, there, don’t be cross. I won’t call\r\nyou miss if you don’t like it. But what am I to call you?”\r\n\r\n“Call me Mariana.”\r\n\r\n“And what is your father’s Christian name?”\r\n\r\n“Why do you want my father’s name? Call me simply Mariana, as I call you\r\nTatiana.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t like to somehow. You had better tell me.”\r\n\r\n“As you like. My father’s name was Vikent. And what was your father’s?”\r\n\r\n“He was called Osip.”\r\n\r\n“Then I shall call you Tatiana Osipovna.”\r\n\r\n“And I’ll call you Mariana Vikentievna. That will be splendid.”\r\n\r\n“Won’t you take a cup of tea with us, Tatiana Osipovna?”\r\n\r\n“For once I will, Mariana Vikentievna, although Egoritch will scold me\r\nafterwards.”\r\n\r\n“Who is Egoritch?”\r\n\r\n“Pavel, my husband.”\r\n\r\n“Sit down, Tatiana Osipovna.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, Mariana Vikentievna.”\r\n\r\nTatiana sat down and began sipping her tea and nibbling pieces of sugar.\r\nShe kept turning the lump of sugar round in her fingers, screwing up her\r\neye on the side on which she bit it. Mariana entered into conversation\r\nwith her and she replied quite at her ease, asked questions in her turn,\r\nand volunteered various pieces of information. She simply worshipped\r\nSolomin and put her husband only second to him. She did not, however,\r\ncare for the factory life.\r\n\r\n“It’s neither town nor country here. I wouldn’t stop an hour if it were\r\nnot for Vassily Fedotitch!”\r\n\r\nMariana listened to her attentively, while Nejdanov, sitting a little to\r\none side, watched her and wondered at her interest. For Mariana it was\r\nall so new, but it seemed to him that he had seen crowds of women like\r\nTatiana and spoken to them hundreds of times.\r\n\r\n“Do you know, Tatiana Osipovna?” Mariana began at last; “you think that\r\nwe want to teach the people, but we want to serve them.”\r\n\r\n“Serve them? Teach them; that’s the best thing you can do for them. Look\r\nat me, for instance. When I married Egoritch I didn’t so much as know\r\nhow to read and write. Now I’ve learned, thanks to Vassily Fedotitch.\r\nHe didn’t teach me himself, he paid an old man to do it. It was he who\r\ntaught me. You see I’m still young, although I’m grown up.”\r\n\r\nMariana was silent.\r\n\r\n“I wanted to learn some sort of trade, Tatiana Osipovna,” Mariana began;\r\n“we must talk about that later on. I’m not good at sewing, but if I\r\ncould learn to cook, then I could go out as a cook.”\r\n\r\nTatiana became thoughtful.\r\n\r\n“Why a cook? Only rich people and merchants keep cooks; the poor do\r\ntheir own cooking. And to cook at a mess for workmen... why you couldn’t\r\ndo that!”\r\n\r\n“But I could live in a rich man’s house and get to know poor people. How\r\nelse can I get to know them? I shall not always have such an opportunity\r\nas I have with you.”\r\n\r\nTatiana turned her empty cup upside down on the saucer.\r\n\r\n“It’s a difficult matter,” she said at last with a sigh, “and can’t be\r\nsettled so easily. I’ll do what I can, but I’m not very clever. We must\r\ntalk it over with Egoritch. He’s clever if you like! Reads all sorts\r\nof books and has everything at his fingers’ ends.” At this point she\r\nglanced at Mariana who was rolling up a cigarette.\r\n\r\n“You’ll excuse me, Mariana Vikentievna, but if you really want to become\r\nsimplified you must give that up.” She pointed to the cigarette. “If you\r\nwant to be a cook, that would never do. Everyone would see at once that\r\nyou are a lady.”\r\n\r\nMariana threw the cigarette out of the window.\r\n\r\n“I won’t smoke any more.... It’s quite easy to give that up. Women of the\r\npeople don’t smoke, so I suppose I ought not to.”\r\n\r\n“That’s quite true, Mariana Vikentievna. Our men indulge in it, but not\r\nthe women. And here’s Vassily Fedotitch coming to see you. Those are\r\nhis steps. You ask him. He’ll arrange everything for you in the best\r\npossible way.”\r\n\r\nSolomin’s voice was heard at the door.\r\n\r\n“Can I come in?”\r\n\r\n“Come in, come in!” Mariana called out.\r\n\r\n“It’s an English habit of mine,” Solomin observed as he came in. “Well,\r\nand how are you getting on? Not homesick yet, eh? I see you’re having\r\ntea with Tatiana. You listen to her, she’s a sensible person. My\r\nemployer is coming today. It’s rather a nuisance. He’s staying to\r\ndinner. But it can’t be helped. He’s the master.”\r\n\r\n“What sort of a man is he?” Nejdanov asked, coming out of his corner.\r\n\r\n“Oh, he’s not bad... knows what he’s about. One of the new generation.\r\nHe’s very polite, wears cuffs, and has his eyes about him no less than\r\nthe old sort. He would skin a flint with his own hands and say, ‘Turn\r\nto this side a little, please... there is still a living spot here... I\r\nmust clean it!’ He’s nice enough to me, because I’m necessary to him.\r\nI just looked in to say that I may not get a chance of seeing you\r\nagain today. Dinner will be brought to you here, and please don’t show\r\nyourselves in the yard. Do you think the Sipiagins will make a search\r\nfor you, Mariana? Will they make a hunt?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t think so,” Mariana replied.\r\n\r\n“And I think they will,” Nejdanov remarked.\r\n\r\n“It doesn’t matter either way,” Solomin continued. “You must be a little\r\ncareful at first, but in a short time you can do as you like.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; only there’s one thing,” Nejdanov observed, “Markelov must know\r\nwhere I am; he must be informed.”\r\n\r\n“But why?”\r\n\r\n“I am afraid it must be done—for the cause. He must always know my\r\nwhereabouts. I’ve given my word. But he’s quite safe, you know!”\r\n\r\n“Very well. We can send Pavel.”\r\n\r\n“And will my clothes be ready for me?”\r\n\r\n“Your special costume you mean? Why, of course... the same masquerade.\r\nIt’s not expensive at any rate. Goodbye. You must be tired. Come,\r\nTatiana.”\r\n\r\nMariana and Nejdanov were left alone again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII\r\n\r\nFirst they clasped each other’s hands, then Mariana offered to help him\r\ntidy his room. She immediately began unpacking his portmanteau and bag,\r\ndeclining his offer of help on the ground that she must get used to work\r\nand wished to do it all herself. She hung his clothes on nails which she\r\ndiscovered in the table drawer and knocked into the wall with the back\r\nof a hairbrush for want of a hammer. Then she arranged his linen in a\r\nlittle old chest of drawers standing in between the two windows.\r\n\r\n“What is this?” she asked suddenly. “Why, it’s a revolver. Is it loaded?\r\nWhat do you want it for?”\r\n\r\n“It is not loaded... but you had better give it to me. You want to know\r\nwhy I have it? How can one get on without a revolver in our calling?”\r\n\r\nShe laughed and went on with her work, shaking each thing out separately\r\nand beating it with her hand; she even stood two pairs of boots under\r\nthe sofa; the few books, packet of papers, and tiny copy-book of verses\r\nshe placed triumphantly upon a three-cornered table, calling it a\r\nwriting and work table, while the other, a round one, she called a\r\ndining and tea table. Then she took up the copy-book of verses in both\r\nhands and, raising it on a level with her face, looked over the edge at\r\nNejdanov and said with a smile:\r\n\r\n“We will read this together when we have some time to spare, won’t we?”\r\n\r\n“Give it to me! I’ll burn it!” Nejdanov burst out. “That’s all it’s fit\r\nfor!”\r\n\r\n“Then why did you take it with you? No, I won’t let you burn it.\r\nHowever, authors are always threatening to burn their things, but they\r\nnever do. I will put it in my room.”\r\n\r\nNejdanov was just about to protest when Mariana rushed into the next\r\nroom with the copy-book and came back without it.\r\n\r\nShe sat down beside him, but instantly got up again. “You have not yet\r\nbeen in my room; would you like to see it? It’s quite as nice as yours.\r\nCome and look.”\r\n\r\nNejdanov rose and followed her. Her room, as she called it, was somewhat\r\nsmaller than his, but the furniture was altogether smarter and newer.\r\nSome flowers in a crystal vase stood on the window-sill and there was an\r\niron bedstead in a corner.\r\n\r\n“Isn’t Solomin a darling!” Mariana exclaimed. “But we mustn’t get too\r\nspoiled. I don’t suppose we shall often have rooms like these. Do you\r\nknow what I’ve been thinking? It would be rather nice if we could get a\r\nplace together so that we need not part! It will probably be difficult,”\r\n she added after a pause; “but we must think of it. But all the same, you\r\nwon’t go back to St. Petersburg, will you?”\r\n\r\n“What should I do in St. Petersburg? Attend lectures at the university\r\nor give lessons? That’s no use to me now.”\r\n\r\n“We must ask Solomin,” Mariana observed. “He will know best.”\r\n\r\nThey went back to the other room and sat down beside each other again.\r\nThey praised Solomin, Tatiana, Pavel; spoke of the Sipiagins and how\r\ntheir former life had receded from them far into the distance, as\r\nif enveloped in a mist; then they clasped each other’s hand again,\r\nexchanged tender glances; wondered what class they had better go among\r\nfirst, and how to behave so that people should not suspect them.\r\n\r\nNejdanov declared that the less they thought about that, and the more\r\nnaturally they behaved, the better.\r\n\r\n“Of course! We want to become simple, as Tatiana says.”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t mean it in that sense,” Nejdanov began; “I meant that we must\r\nnot be self-conscious.”\r\n\r\nMariana suddenly burst out laughing.\r\n\r\n“Do you remember, Aliosha, how I said that we had both become\r\nsimplified?”\r\n\r\nNejdanov also laughed, repeated “simplified,” and began musing. Mariana\r\ntoo became pensive.\r\n\r\n“Aliosha!” she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“What is it?”\r\n\r\n“It seems to me that we are both a little uncomfortable. Young—_des\r\nnouveaux mariés_,” she explained, “when away on their honeymoon no doubt\r\nfeel as we do. They are happy... all is well with them—but they feel\r\nuncomfortable.”\r\n\r\nNejdanov gave a forced smile.\r\n\r\n“You know very well, Mariana, that we are not young ... in that sense.”\r\n\r\nMariana rose from her chair and stood before him.\r\n\r\n“That depends on yourself.”\r\n\r\n“How?”\r\n\r\n“Aliosha, you know, dear, that when you tell me, as a man of honour...\r\nand I will believe you because I know you are honourable; when you tell\r\nme that you love me with that love... the love that gives one person the\r\nright over another’s life, when you tell me that—I am yours.”\r\n\r\nNejdanov blushed and turned away a little.\r\n\r\n“When I tell you that....”\r\n\r\n“Yes, then! But you see, Aliosha, you don’t say that to me now.... Oh\r\nyes, Aliosha, you are truly an honourable man. Enough of this! Let us\r\ntalk of more serious things.”\r\n\r\n“But I do love you, Mariana!”\r\n\r\n“I don’t doubt that... and shall wait. But there, I have not quite\r\nfinished arranging your writing table. Here is something wrapped up,\r\nsomething hard.”\r\n\r\nNejdanov sprang up from his chair.\r\n\r\n“Don’t touch that, Mariana.... Leave it alone, please!”\r\n\r\nMariana looked at him over her shoulder and raised her eyebrows in\r\namazement.\r\n\r\n“Is it a mystery? A secret? Have you a secret?”\r\n\r\n“Yes... yes...” Nejdanov stammered out, and added by way of explanation,\r\n“it’s a portrait.”\r\n\r\nThe word escaped him unawares. The packet Mariana held in her hand was\r\nher own portrait, which Markelov had given Nejdanov.\r\n\r\n“A portrait?” she drawled out. “Is it a woman’s?”\r\n\r\nShe handed him the packet, which he took so clumsily that it slipped out\r\nof his hand and fell open.\r\n\r\n“Why... it’s my portrait!” Mariana exclaimed quickly. “I suppose I may\r\nlook at my own portrait.” She took it out of Nejdanov’s hand.\r\n\r\n“Did you do it?”\r\n\r\n“No... I didn’t.”\r\n\r\n“Who then? Markelov?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you’ve guessed right.”\r\n\r\n“Then how did it come to be in your possession?”\r\n\r\n“He gave it to me.”\r\n\r\n“When?”\r\n\r\nNejdanov told her when and under what circumstances. While he was\r\nspeaking Mariana glanced from him to the portrait. The same thought\r\nflashed across both their minds. “If _he_ were in this room, then _he_\r\nwould have the right to demand...” But neither Mariana nor Nejdanov gave\r\nexpression to this thought in words, perhaps because each was conscious\r\nwhat was in the other’s mind.\r\n\r\nMariana quietly wrapped the portrait up again in its paper and put it on\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\n“What a good man he is!” she murmured. “I wonder where he is now?”\r\n\r\n“Why, at home of course. Tomorrow or the day after I must go and see\r\nhim about some books and pamphlets. He promised to give me some, but\r\nevidently forgot to do so before I left.”\r\n\r\n“And do you think, Aliosha, that when he gave you this portrait he\r\nrenounced everything... absolutely everything?”\r\n\r\n“I think so.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think you will find him at home?”\r\n\r\n“Of course.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” Mariana lowered her eyes and dropped her hands at her sides. “But\r\nhere comes Tatiana with our dinner,” she exclaimed suddenly. “Isn’t she\r\na dear!”\r\n\r\nTatiana appeared with the knives and forks, serviettes, plates and\r\ndishes. While laying the table she related all the news about the\r\nfactory. “The master came from Moscow by rail and started running from\r\nfloor to floor like a madman. Of course he doesn’t understand anything\r\nand does it only for show—to set an example so to speak. Vassily\r\nFedotitch treats him like a child. The master wanted to make some\r\nunpleasantness, but Vassily Fedotitch soon shut him up. ‘I’ll throw\r\nit up this minute,’ he said, so he soon began to sing small. They are\r\nhaving dinner now. The master brought someone with him. A Moscow swell\r\nwho does nothing but admire everything. He must be very rich, I think,\r\nby the way he holds his tongue and shakes his head. And so stout, very\r\nstout! A real swell! No wonder there’s a saying that ‘Moscow lies at the\r\nfoot of Russia and everything rolls down to her.’”\r\n\r\n“How you notice everything!” Mariana exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I do rather,” Tatiana observed. “Well, here is your dinner. Come\r\nand have it and I’ll sit and look at you for a little while.”\r\n\r\nMariana and Nejdanov sat down to table, whilst Tatiana sat down on the\r\nwindow-sill and rested her cheek in her hand.\r\n\r\n“I watch you...” she observed. “And what dear, young, tender creatures\r\nyou are. You’re so nice to look at that it quite makes my heart ache.\r\nAh, my dear! You are taking a heavier burden on your shoulders than you\r\ncan bear. It’s people like you that the tsar’s folk are ready to put\r\ninto prison.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing of the kind. Don’t frighten us,” Nejdanov remarked. “You know\r\nthe old saying, ‘As you make your bed so you must lie on it.’”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know. But the beds are so narrow nowadays that you can’t get out\r\nof them!”\r\n\r\n“Have you any children?” Mariana asked to change the subject.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I have a boy. He goes to school now. I had a girl too, but she’s\r\ngone, the little bird! An accident happened to her. She fell under a\r\nwheel. If only it had killed her at once! But no, she suffered a long\r\nwhile. Since then I’ve become more tender-hearted. Before I was as wild\r\nand hard as a tree!”\r\n\r\n“Why, did you not love your Pavel?”\r\n\r\n“But that’s not the same. Only a girl’s feelings. And you—do you love\r\n_him_?”\r\n\r\n“Of course I do.”\r\n\r\n“Very much?”\r\n\r\n“Ever so much.”\r\n\r\n“Really?...” Tatiana looked from one to the other, but said nothing\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you what I would like. Could you get me some coarse, strong\r\nwool? I want to knit some stockings...plain ones.”\r\n\r\nTatiana promised to have everything done, and clearing the table, went\r\nout of the room with her firm, quiet step.\r\n\r\n“Well, what shall we do now?” Mariana asked, turning to Nejdanov, and\r\nwithout, waiting for a reply, continued, “Since our real work does not\r\nbegin until tomorrow, let us devote this evening to literature. Would\r\nyou like to? We can read your poems. I will be a severe critic, I\r\npromise you.”\r\n\r\nIt took Nejdanov a long time before he consented, but he gave in at\r\nlast and began reading aloud out of his copybook. Mariana sat close to\r\nhim and gazed into his face as he read. She had been right; she turned\r\nout to be a very severe critic. Very few of the verses pleased her.\r\nShe preferred the purely lyrical, short ones, to the didactic, as she\r\nexpressed it. Nejdanov did not read well. He had not the courage to\r\nattempt any style, and at the same time wanted to avoid a dry tone. It\r\nturned out neither the one thing nor the other. Mariana interrupted\r\nhim suddenly by asking if he knew Dobrolubov’s beautiful poem, which\r\nbegins, “To die for me no terror holds.” She read it to him—also not\r\nvery well—in a somewhat childish manner.\r\n\r\n    [To die for me no terror holds,\r\n     Yet one fear presses on my mind,\r\n     That death should on me helpless play\r\n     A satire of the bitter kind.\r\n\r\n     For much I fear that o’er my corse\r\n     The scalding tears of friends shall flow,\r\n     And that, too late, they should with zeal\r\n     Fresh flowers upon my body throw.\r\n\r\n     That fate sardonic should recall\r\n     The ones I loved to my cold side,\r\n     And make me lying in the ground,\r\n     The object of love once denied.\r\n\r\n     That all my aching heart’s desires,\r\n     So vainly sought for from my birth,\r\n     Should crowd unbidden, smiling kind\r\n     Above my body’s mound of earth.]\r\n\r\nNejdanov thought that it was too sad and too bitter. He could not\r\nhave written a poem like that, he added, as he had no fears of any one\r\nweeping over his grave... there would be no tears.\r\n\r\n“There will be if I outlive you,” Mariana observed slowly, and lifting\r\nher eyes to the ceiling she asked, in a whisper, as if speaking to\r\nherself:\r\n\r\n“How did he do the portrait of me? From memory?”\r\n\r\nNejdanov turned to her quickly.\r\n\r\n“Yes, from memory.”\r\n\r\nMariana was surprised at his reply. It seemed to her that she merely\r\nthought the question. “It is really wonderful...” she continued in\r\nthe same tone of voice. “Why, he can’t draw at all. What was I talking\r\nabout?” she added aloud. “Oh yes, it was about Dobrolubov’s poems. One\r\nought to write poems like Pushkin’s, or even like Dobrolubov’s. It is\r\nnot poetry exactly, but something nearly as good.”\r\n\r\n“And poems like mine one should not write at all. Isn’t that so?”\r\n Nejdanov asked.\r\n\r\n“Poems like yours please your friends, not because they are good, but\r\nbecause _you_ are a good man and they are like you.”\r\n\r\nNejdanov smiled.\r\n\r\n“You have completely buried them and me with them!” Mariana slapped his\r\nhand and called him naughty. Soon after she announced that she was tired\r\nand wanted to go to bed.\r\n\r\n“By the way,” she added, shaking back her short thick curls, “do you\r\nknow that I have a hundred and thirty roubles? And how much have you?”\r\n\r\n“Ninety-eight.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, then we are rich... for simplified folk. Well, good night, until\r\ntomorrow.”\r\n\r\nShe went out, but in a minute or two her door opened slightly and he\r\nheard her say, “Goodnight!” then more softly another “Goodnight!” and\r\nthe key turned in the lock.\r\n\r\nNejdanov sank on to the sofa and covered his face with his hands. Then\r\nhe got up quickly, went to her door and knocked.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” was heard from within.\r\n\r\n“Not till tomorrow, Mariana... not till tomorrow!”\r\n\r\n“Till tomorrow,” she replied softly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIX\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning Nejdanov again knocked at Mariana’s door.\r\n\r\n“It is I,” he replied in answer to her “Who’s that?” “Can you come out to\r\nme?”\r\n\r\n“In a minute.”\r\n\r\nShe came out and uttered a cry of alarm. At first she did not recognise\r\nhim. He had on a long-skirted, shabby, yellowish nankin coat, with small\r\nbuttons and a high waist; his hair was dressed in the Russian fashion\r\nwith a parting straight down the middle; he had a blue kerchief round\r\nhis neck, in his hand he held a cap with a broken peak, on his feet a\r\npair of dirty leather boots.\r\n\r\n“Heavens!” Mariana exclaimed. “How ugly you look!” and thereupon threw\r\nher arms round him and kissed him quickly. “But why did you get yourself\r\nup like this? You look like some sort of shopkeeper, or pedlar, or a\r\nretired servant. Why this long coat? Why not simply like a peasant?”\r\n\r\n“Why?” Nejdanov began. He certainly did look like some sort of\r\nfishmonger in that garb, was conscious of it himself, and was annoyed\r\nand embarrassed at heart. He felt uncomfortable, and not knowing what to\r\ndo with his hands, kept patting himself on the breast with the fingers\r\noutspread, as though he were brushing himself.\r\n\r\n“Because as a peasant I should have been recognised at once Pavel says,\r\nand that in this costume I look as if I had been born to it ... which is\r\nnot very flattering to my vanity, by the way.”\r\n\r\n“Are you going to begin at once?” Mariana asked eagerly.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I shall try, though in reality—”\r\n\r\n“You are lucky!” Mariana interrupted him.\r\n\r\n“This Pavel is a wonderful fellow,” Nejdanov continued. “He can see\r\nthrough and through you in a second, and will suddenly screw up his face\r\nas if he knew nothing, and would not interfere with anything for the\r\nworld. He works for the cause himself, yet laughs at it the whole time.\r\nHe brought me the books from Markelov; he knows him and calls him Sergai\r\nMihailovitch; and as for Solomin, he would go through fire and water for\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\n“And so would Tatiana,” Mariana observed. “Why are people so devoted to\r\nhim?”\r\n\r\nNejdanov did not reply.\r\n\r\n“What sort of books did Pavel bring you?” Mariana asked.\r\n\r\n“Oh, nothing new. ‘The Story of the Four Brothers,’ and then the\r\nordinary, well-known ones, which are far better I think.”\r\n\r\nMariana looked around uneasily.\r\n\r\n“I wonder what has become of Tatiana? She promised to come early.”\r\n\r\n“Here I am!” Tatiana exclaimed, coming in with a bundle in her hand. She\r\nhad heard Mariana’s exclamation from behind the door.\r\n\r\n“There’s plenty of time. See what I’ve brought you!”\r\n\r\nMariana flew towards her.\r\n\r\n“Have you brought it?”\r\n\r\nTatiana patted the bundle.\r\n\r\n“Everything is here, quite ready. You have only to put the things on and\r\ngo out to astonish the world.”\r\n\r\n“Come along, come along, Tatiana Osipovna, you are a dear——”\r\n\r\nMariana led her off to her own room.\r\n\r\nLeft alone, Nejdanov walked up and down the room once or twice with a\r\npeculiarly shuffling gait (he imagined that all shopkeepers walked like\r\nthat), then he carefully sniffed at his sleeves, the inside of his cap,\r\nmade a grimace, looked at himself in the little looking-glass hanging in\r\nbetween the windows, and shook his head; he certainly did not look very\r\nprepossessing. “So much the better,” he thought. Then he took several\r\npamphlets, thrust them into his side pocket, and began to practise\r\nspeaking like a shopkeeper. “That sounds like it,” he thought, “but\r\nafter all there is no need of acting, my get-up is convincing enough.”\r\n Just then he recollected a German exile, who had to make his escape\r\nright across Russia with only a poor knowledge of the language. But\r\nthanks to a merchant’s cap which he had bought in a provincial town, he\r\nwas taken everywhere for a merchant and had successfully made his way\r\nacross the frontier.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Solomin entered.\r\n\r\n“I say!” he exclaimed. “Arrayed in all your war paint? Excuse me, my\r\ndear fellow, but in that garb one can hardly speak to you respectfully.”\r\n\r\n“Please don’t. I had long meant to ask you—”\r\n\r\n“But it’s early as yet. It doesn’t matter if you only want to get used\r\nto it, only you must not go out yet. My employer is still here. He’s in\r\nbed.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll go out later on,” Nejdanov responded. “I’ll explore the\r\nneighbourhood a little, until further orders come.”\r\n\r\n“Capital! But I tell you what, Alexai.... I may call you Alexai, may I\r\nnot?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, or Lexy if you like,” Nejdanov added with a smile.\r\n\r\n“No; there is no need to overdo things. Listen. Good counsel is\r\nbetter than money, as the saying goes. I see that you have pamphlets.\r\nDistribute them wherever you like, only not in the factory on any\r\naccount!”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“In the first place, because it won’t be safe for you; in the second,\r\nbecause I promised the owner not to do that sort of thing here. You see\r\nthe place is his after all, and then something has already been done...\r\na school and so on. You might do more harm than good. Further than\r\nthat, you may do as you like, I shall not hinder you. But you must not\r\ninterfere with my workpeople.”\r\n\r\n“Caution is always useful,” Nejdanov remarked with a sarcastic smile.\r\n\r\nSolomin smiled his characteristic broad smile.\r\n\r\n“Yes, my dear Alexai, it’s always useful. But what do I see? Where are\r\nwe?”\r\n\r\nThe last words referred to Mariana, who at that moment appeared in the\r\ndoorway of her room in a print dress that had been washed a great many\r\ntimes, with a yellow kerchief over her shoulders and a red one on her\r\nhead. Tatiana stood behind her, smiling good-naturedly. Mariana seemed\r\nyounger and brighter in her simple garment and looked far better than\r\nNejdanov in his long-skirted coat.\r\n\r\n“Vassily Fedotitch, don’t laugh, please,” Mariana implored, turning as\r\nred as a poppy.\r\n\r\n“There’s a nice couple!” Tatiana exclaimed, clapping her hands. “But\r\nyou, my dear, don’t be angry, you look well enough, but beside my little\r\ndove you’re nowhere.”\r\n\r\n“And, really, she is charming,” Nejdanov thought; “oh, how I love her!”\r\n\r\n“Look now,” Tatiana continued, “she insisted on changing rings with me.\r\nShe has given me a golden ring and taken my silver one.”\r\n\r\n“Girls of the people do not wear gold rings,” Mariana observed.\r\n\r\nTatiana sighed.\r\n\r\n“I’ll take good care of it, my dear; don’t be afraid.”\r\n\r\n“Well, sit down, sit down both of you,” Solomin began; he had been\r\nstanding all the while with his head bent a little to one side, gazing\r\nat Mariana. “In olden days, if you remember, people always sat down\r\nbefore starting on a journey. And you have both a long and wearisome one\r\nbefore you.”\r\n\r\nMariana, still crimson, sat down, then Nejdanov and Solomin, and last\r\nof all Tatiana took her seat on a thick block of wood. Solomin looked at\r\neach of them in turn.\r\n\r\n     “Let us step back a pace,\r\n      Let us step back a bit,\r\n      To see with what grace\r\n      And how nicely we sit,”\r\n\r\nhe said with a frown. Suddenly he burst out laughing, but so\r\ngood-naturedly that no one was in the least offended, on the contrary,\r\nthey all began to feel merry too. Only Nejdanov rose suddenly.\r\n\r\n“I must go now,” he said; “this is all very nice, but rather like a\r\nfarce. Don’t be uneasy,” he added, turning to Solomin. “I shall not\r\ninterfere with your people. I’ll try my tongue on the folk around about\r\nand will tell you all about it when I come back, Mariana, if there is\r\nanything to tell. Wish me luck!”\r\n\r\n“Why not have a cup of tea first?” Tatiana remarked.\r\n\r\n“No thanks. If I want any I can go into an eating-house or into a public\r\nhouse.”\r\n\r\nTatiana shook her head.\r\n\r\n“Goodbye, goodbye... good luck to you!” Nejdanov added, entering upon\r\nhis role of small shopkeeper. But before he had reached the door Pavel\r\nthrust his head in from the passage under his very nose, and handing him\r\na thin, long staff, cut out all the way down like a screw, he said:\r\n\r\n“Take this, Alexai Dmitritch, and lean on it as you walk. And the\r\nfarther you hold it away from yourself the better it will look.”\r\n\r\nNejdanov took the staff without a word and went out. Tatiana wanted to\r\ngo out too, but Mariana stopped her.\r\n\r\n“Wait a minute, Tatiana Osipovna. I want you.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll be back directly with the samovar. Your friend has gone off\r\nwithout tea, he was in such a mighty hurry. But that is no reason why\r\nyou should not have any. Later on things will be clearer.”\r\n\r\nTatiana went out and Solomin also rose. Mariana was standing with her\r\nback to him, but when at last she turned towards him, rather surprised\r\nthat he had not said a single word, she saw in his face, in his eyes\r\nthat were fixed on her, an expression she had not seen there before; an\r\nexpression of inquiry, anxiety, almost of curiosity. She became confused\r\nand blushed again. Solomin, too, was ashamed of what she had read in his\r\nface and began talking louder than was his wont.\r\n\r\n“Well, well, Mariana, and so you have made a beginning.”\r\n\r\n“What sort of beginning, Vassily Fedotitch? Do you call this a\r\nbeginning? Alexai was right. It’s as if we were acting a farce.”\r\n\r\nSolomin sat down again.\r\n\r\n“But, Mariana... what did you picture the beginning to be like? Not\r\nstanding behind the barricades waving a flag and shouting, ‘Hurrah for\r\nthe republic!’ Besides, that is not a woman’s work. Now, today you will\r\nbegin teaching some Lukeria, something good for her, and a difficult\r\nmatter it will be, because you won’t understand your Lukeria and she\r\nwon’t understand you, and on top of it she will imagine that what you\r\nare teaching is of no earthly use to her. In two or three weeks you will\r\ntry your hand on another Lukeria, and meanwhile you will be washing a\r\nbaby here, teaching another the alphabet, or handing some sick man his\r\nmedicine. That will be your beginning.”\r\n\r\n“But sisters of mercy do that, Vassily Fedotitch! What is the use of\r\nall this, then?” Mariana pointed to herself and round about with a vague\r\ngesture. “I dreamt of something else.”\r\n\r\n“Did you want to sacrifice yourself?”\r\n\r\nMariana’s eyes glistened.\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, yes!”\r\n\r\n“And Nejdanov?”\r\n\r\nMariana shrugged her shoulders.\r\n\r\n“What of Nejdanov? We shall go together... or I will go alone.”\r\n\r\nSolomin looked at her intently.\r\n\r\n“Do you know, Mariana... excuse the coarse expression... but, to my\r\nmind, combing the scurfy head of a gutter child is a sacrifice; a great\r\nsacrifice of which not many people are capable.”\r\n\r\n“I would not shirk that, Vassily Fedotitch.”\r\n\r\n“I know you would not. You are capable of doing that and will do it,\r\nuntil something else turns up.”\r\n\r\n“But for that sort of thing I must learn of Tatiana!”\r\n\r\n“You could not do better. You will be washing pots and plucking\r\nchickens.... And, who knows, maybe you will save your country in that\r\nway!”\r\n\r\n“You are laughing at me, Vassily Fedotitch.”\r\n\r\nSolomin shook his head slowly.\r\n\r\n“My dear Mariana, believe me, I am not laughing at you. What I said was\r\nthe simple truth. You are already, all you Russian women, more capable\r\nand higher than we men.”\r\n\r\nMariana raised her eyes.\r\n\r\n“I would like to live up to your idea of us, Solomin... and then I\r\nshould be ready to die.”\r\n\r\nSolomin stood up.\r\n\r\n“No, it is better to live! That’s the main thing. By the way, would you\r\nlike to know what is happening at the Sipiagins? Won’t they do anything?\r\nYou have only to drop Pavel a hint and he will find out everything in a\r\ntwinkling.”\r\n\r\nMariana was surprised.\r\n\r\n“What a wonderful person he is!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, he certainly is wonderful. And should you want to marry Alexai,\r\nhe will arrange that too with Zosim, the priest. You remember I told you\r\nabout him. But perhaps it is not necessary as yet, eh?”\r\n\r\n“No, not yet.”\r\n\r\n“Very well.” Solomin went up to the door dividing the two rooms,\r\nMariana’s and Nejdanov’s, and examined the lock.\r\n\r\n“What are you doing?” Mariana asked. “Does it lock all right?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” Mariana whispered.\r\n\r\nSolomin turned to her. She did not raise her eyes.\r\n\r\n“Then there is no need to bother about the Sipiagins,” he continued\r\ngaily, “is there?”\r\n\r\nSolomin was about to go out.\r\n\r\n“Vassily Fedotitch...”\r\n\r\n“Yes...”\r\n\r\n“Why is it you are so talkative with me when you are usually so silent?\r\nYou can’t imagine what pleasure it gives me.”\r\n\r\n“Why?” Solomin took both her soft little hands in his big hard ones.\r\n“Why, did you ask? Well, I suppose it must be because I love you so\r\nmuch. Good-bye.”\r\n\r\nHe went out. Mariana stood pensive looking after him. In a little while\r\nshe went to find Tatiana who had not yet brought the samovar. She had\r\ntea with her, washed some pots, plucked a chicken, and even combed out\r\nsome boy’s tangled head of hair.\r\n\r\nBefore dinner she returned to her own rooms and soon afterwards Nejdanov\r\narrived.\r\n\r\nHe came in tired and covered with dust and dropped on to the sofa. She\r\nimmediately sat down beside him.\r\n\r\n“Well, tell me what happened.”\r\n\r\n“You remember the two lines,” he responded in a weary voice:\r\n\r\n    “It would have been so funny\r\n     Were it not so sad.”\r\n\r\n“Do you remember?”\r\n\r\n“Of course I do.”\r\n\r\n“Well, these lines apply admirably to my first expedition, excepting\r\nthat it was more funny than sad. I’ve come to the conclusion that there\r\nis nothing easier than to act a part. No one dreamed of suspecting me.\r\nThere was one thing, however, that I had not thought of. You must be\r\nprepared with some sort of yarn beforehand, or else when any one asks\r\nyou where you’ve come from and why you’ve come, you don’t know what to\r\nsay. But, however, even that is not so important. You’ve only to stand a\r\ndrink and lie as much as you like.”\r\n\r\n“And you? Did you lie?”\r\n\r\n“Of course I did, as much as I could. And then I’ve discovered that\r\nabsolutely everyone you come across is discontented, only no one cares\r\nto find out the remedy for this discontent. I made a very poor show at\r\npropaganda, only succeeded in leaving a couple of pamphlets in a room\r\nand shoving a third into a cart. What may come of them the Lord only\r\nknows! I ran across four men whom I offered some pamphlets. The first\r\nasked if it was a religious book and refused to take it; the second\r\ncould not read, but took it home to his children for the sake of the\r\npicture on the cover; the third seemed hopeful at first, but ended by\r\nabusing me soundly and also not taking it; the fourth took a little\r\nbook, thanked me very much, but I doubt if he understood a single word I\r\nsaid to him. Besides that, a dog bit my leg, a peasant woman threatened\r\nme with a poker from the door of her hut, shouting, ‘Ugh! you pig! You\r\nMoscow rascals! There’s no end to you!’ and then a soldier shouted after\r\nme, ‘Hi, there! We’ll make mince-meat of you!’ and he got drunk at my\r\nexpense!”\r\n\r\n“Well, and what else?”\r\n\r\n“What else? I’ve got a blister on my foot; one of my boots is horribly\r\nlarge. And now I’m as hungry as a wolf and my head is splitting from the\r\nvodka.”\r\n\r\n“Why, did you drink much?”\r\n\r\n“No, only a little to set the example, but I’ve been in five\r\npublic-houses. I can’t endure this beastliness, vodka. Goodness knows\r\nwhy our people drink it. If one must drink this stuff in order to become\r\nsimplified, then I had rather be excused!”\r\n\r\n“And so no one suspected you?”\r\n\r\n“No one, with the exception, perhaps, of a bar-man, a stout individual\r\nwith pale eyes, who did look at me somewhat suspiciously. I overheard\r\nhim saying to his wife, ‘Keep an eye on that carroty-haired one with\r\nthe squint.’ (I was not aware until that moment that I had a squint.)\r\n‘There’s something wrong about him. See how he’s sticking over his\r\nvodka.’ What he meant by ‘sticking’ exactly, I didn’t understand, but\r\nit could hardly have been to my credit. It reminded me of the _mauvais\r\nton_ in Gogol’s “Revisor”, do you remember? Perhaps because I tried\r\nto pour my vodka under the table. Oh dear! It is difficult for an\r\naesthetic creature like me to come in contact with real life.”\r\n\r\n“Never mind. Better luck next time,” Mariana said consolingly. “But I am\r\nglad you see the humorous side of this, your first attempt. You were not\r\nreally bored, were you?”\r\n\r\n“No, it was rather amusing. But I know that I shall think it all over\r\nnow and it will make me miserable.”\r\n\r\n“But I won’t let you think about it! I will tell you everything I did.\r\nDinner will be here in a minute. By the way, I must tell you that\r\nI washed the saucepan Tatiana cooked the soup in.... I’ll tell you\r\neverything, every little detail.”\r\n\r\nAnd so she did. Nejdanov listened and could not take his eyes off her.\r\nShe stopped several times to ask why he looked at her so intently, but\r\nhe was silent.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner she offered to read Spielhagen aloud to him, but had\r\nscarcely got through one page when he got up suddenly and fell at her\r\nfeet. She stood up; he flung both his arms round her knees and began\r\nuttering passionate, disconnected, and despairing words. He wanted to\r\ndie, he knew he would soon die.... She did not stir, did not resist.\r\nShe calmly submitted to his passionate embraces, and calmly, even\r\naffectionately, glanced down upon him. She laid both her hands on his\r\nhead, feverishly pressed to the fold of her dress, but her calmness had\r\na more powerful effect on him than if she had repulsed him. He got up\r\nmurmuring: “Forgive me, Mariana, for today and for yesterday. Tell me\r\nagain that you are prepared to wait until I am worthy of your love, and\r\nforgive me.”\r\n\r\n“I gave you my word. I never change.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, dear. Goodbye.”\r\n\r\nNejdanov went out and Mariana locked the door of her room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX\r\n\r\nA fortnight later, in the same room, Nejdanov sat bending over his\r\nthree-legged table, writing to his friend Silin by the dim light of a\r\ntallow candle. (It was long past midnight. Muddy garments lay scattered\r\non the sofa, on the floor, just where they had been thrown off. A fine\r\ndrizzly rain pattered against the window-panes and a strong, warm wind\r\nmoaned about the roof of the house.)\r\n\r\nMY DEAR VLADIMIR,—I am writing to you without giving my address and\r\nwill send this letter by a messenger to a distant posting-station as my\r\nbeing here is a secret, and to disclose it might mean the ruin not of\r\nmyself alone. It is enough for you to know that for the last two weeks\r\nI have been living in a large factory together with Mariana. We ran away\r\nfrom the Sipiagins on the day on which I last wrote to you. A friend has\r\ngiven us shelter here. For convenience sake I will call him Vassily. He\r\nis the chief here and an excellent man. Our stay is only of a temporary\r\nnature; we will move on when the time for action comes. But, however,\r\njudging by events so far, the time is hardly likely ever to come!\r\nVladimir, I am horribly miserable. I must tell you before everything\r\nthat although Mariana and I ran away together, we have so far been\r\nliving like brother and sister. She loves me and told me she would be\r\nmine if I feel I have the right to ask it of her.\r\n\r\nVladimir, I do not feel that I have the right! She trusts me, believes\r\nin my honour—I cannot deceive her. I know that I never loved nor will\r\never love any one more than her (of that I am convinced), but for all\r\nthat, how can I unite her fate forever with mine? A living being to\r\na corpse? Well, if not a complete corpse, at any rate, a half-dead\r\ncreature. Where would one’s conscience be? I can hear you say that if\r\npassion was strong enough the conscience would be silent. But that is\r\njust the point; I am a corpse, an honest, well-meaning corpse if\r\nyou like, but a corpse nevertheless. Please do not say that I always\r\nexaggerate. Everything I have told you is absolutely true. Mariana is\r\nvery reserved and is at present wrapped up in her activities in which\r\nshe believes, and I?\r\n\r\nWell, enough of love and personal happiness and all that. It is now\r\na fortnight since I have been going among “the people,” and really it\r\nwould be impossible to imagine anything more stupid than they are. Of\r\ncourse the fault lies probably more in me than in the work itself. I\r\nam not a fanatic. I am not one of those who regenerate themselves by\r\ncontact with the people and do not lay them on my aching bosom like a\r\nflannel bandage—I want to influence them. But how? How can it be done?\r\nWhen I am among them I find myself listening all the time, taking things\r\nin, but when it comes to saying anything—I am at a loss for a word! I\r\nfeel that I am no good, a bad actor in a part that does not suit him.\r\nConscientiousness or scepticism are absolutely of no use, nor is a\r\npitiful sort of humour directed against oneself. It is worse than\r\nuseless! I find it disgusting to look at the filthy rags I carry about\r\non me, the masquerade as Vassily calls it! They say you must first\r\nlearn the language of the people, their habits and customs, but rubbish,\r\nrubbish, rubbish, I say! You have only to _believe_ in what you say\r\nand say what you like! I once happened to hear a sectarian prophet\r\ndelivering a sermon. Goodness only knows what arrant nonsense he talked,\r\na sort of gorgeous mix-up of ecclesiastical learning, interspersed with\r\npeasant expressions, not even in decent Russian, but in some outlandish\r\ndialect, but he took one by storm with his enthusiasm—went straight to\r\nthe heart. There he stood with flashing eyes, the voice deep and firm,\r\nwith clenched fist—as though he were made of iron! No one understood\r\nwhat he was saying, but everyone bowed down before him and followed\r\nhim. But when I begin to speak, I seem like a culprit begging for\r\nforgiveness. I ought to join the sectarians, although their wisdom is\r\nnot great... but they have faith, faith!\r\n\r\nMariana too has faith. She works from morning until night with\r\nTatiana—a peasant woman here, as good as can be and not by any means\r\nstupid; she says, by the way, that we want to become simplified and\r\ncalls us simple souls. Mariana is about working with this woman from\r\nmorning until night, scarcely sitting down for a moment, just like a\r\nregular ant! She is delighted that her hands are turning red and rough,\r\nand in the midst of these humble occupations is looking forward to the\r\nscaffold! She has even attempted to discard shoes; went out somewhere\r\nbarefoot and came back barefoot. I heard her washing her feet for a long\r\ntime afterwards and then saw her come out, treading cautiously; they\r\nwere evidently sore, poor thing, but her face was radiant with smiles\r\nas though she had found a treasure or been illuminated by the sun. Yes,\r\nMariana is a brick! But when I try to talk to her of my feelings,\r\na certain shame comes over me somehow, as though I were violating\r\nsomething that was not my own, and then that glance... Oh, that\r\nawful devoted, irresistible glance! “Take me,” it seems to say, “_but\r\nremember_....” Enough of this! Is there not something higher and better\r\nin this world? In other words, put on your filthy coat and go among the\r\npeople.... Oh, yes, I am just going.\r\n\r\nHow I loathe this irritability, sensitiveness, impressionable-ness,\r\nfastidiousness, inherited from my aristocratic father! What right had\r\nhe to bring me into this world, endowed with qualities quite unsuited\r\nto the sphere in which I must live? To create a bird and throw it in the\r\nwater? An aesthetic amidst filth! A democrat, a lover of the people, yet\r\nthe very smell of their filthy vodka makes me feel sick!\r\n\r\nBut it’s too bad blaming my father. He was not responsible for my\r\nbecoming a democrat.\r\n\r\nYes, Vladimir, I am in a bad plight. Grey, depressing thoughts are\r\ncontinually haunting me. Can it be, you will be asking me, that I have\r\nnot met with anything consoling, any good living personality, however\r\nignorant he might not be? How shall I tell you? I have run across\r\nsomeone—a decent clever chap, but unfortunately, however hard I may try\r\nto get nearer him, he has no need of either me or my pamphlets—that is\r\nthe root of the matter! Pavel, a factoryhand here (he is Vassily’s right\r\nhand, a clever fellow with his head screwed on the right way, a future\r\n“head,” I think I wrote to you about him), well this Pavel has a friend,\r\na peasant called Elizar, also a smart chap, as free and courageous as\r\none would wish, but as soon as we get together there seems a dead wall\r\nbetween us! His face spells one big “No!” Then there was another man I\r\nran across—he was a rather quarrelsome type by the way. “Don’t you try\r\nto get around me, sir,” he said. “What I want to know is would you give\r\nup your land now, or not?” “But I’m not a gentleman,” I remonstrated.\r\n“Bless you!” he exclaimed, “you a common man and no more sense than that!\r\nLeave me alone, please!”\r\n\r\nAnother thing I’ve noticed is that if anyone listens to you readily\r\nand takes your pamphlets at once, he is sure to be of an undesirable,\r\nbrainless sort. Or you may chance upon some frightfully talkative\r\nindividual who can do nothing but keep on repeating some favourite\r\nexpression. One such nearly drove me mad; everything with him was\r\n“production.” No matter what you said to him he came out with his\r\n“production,” damn him! Just one more remark.\r\n\r\nDo you remember some time ago there used to be a great deal of talk\r\nabout “superfluous” people—Hamlets? Such “superfluous people” are now\r\nto be met with among the peasants! They have their own characteristics\r\nof course and are for the most part inclined to consumption. They are\r\ninteresting types and come to us readily, but as far as the cause is\r\nconcerned they are ineffective, like all other Hamlets. Well, what can\r\none do? Start a secret printing press? There are pamphlets enough as it\r\nis, some that say, “Cross yourself and take up the hatchet,” and others\r\nthat say simply, “Take up the hatchet” without the crossing. Or should\r\none write novels of peasant life with plenty of padding? They wouldn’t\r\nget published, you know. Perhaps it might be better to take up the\r\nhatchet after all? But against whom, with whom, and what for? So that\r\nour state soldier may shoot us down with the state rifle? It would only\r\nbe a complicated form of suicide! It would be better to make an end of\r\nyourself—you would at any rate know when and how, and choose the spot\r\nto aim at.\r\n\r\nI am beginning to think that if some war were to break out, some\r\npeople’s war—I would go and take part in it, not so as to free others\r\n(free others while one’s own are groaning under the yoke!!), but to make\r\nan end of myself....\r\n\r\nOur friend Vassily, who gave us shelter here, is a lucky man. He\r\nbelongs to our camp, but is so calm and quiet. He doesn’t want to hurry\r\nover things. I should have quarrelled with another, but I can’t with\r\nhim. The secret lies not in his convictions, but in the man himself.\r\nVassily has a character that you can’t kindle, but he’s all right\r\nnevertheless. He is with us a good deal, with Mariana. What surprises\r\nme is that although I love her and she loves me (I see you smiling at\r\nthis, but the fact remains!) we have nothing to talk about, while she\r\nis constantly discussing and arguing with him and listening too. I am\r\nnot jealous of him; he is trying to find a place for her somewhere, at\r\nany rate, she keeps on asking him to do so, but it makes me feel bitter\r\nto look at them both. And would you believe it—I have only to drop a\r\nhint about marrying and she would agree at once and the priest Zosim\r\nwould put in an appearance, “Isaiah, rejoice!” and the rest of it. But\r\nthis would not make it any easier for me and _nothing would be changed\r\nby it_.... Whatever you do, there is no way out of it! Life has cut me\r\nshort, my dear Vladimir, as our little drunken tailor used to say, you\r\nremember, when he used to complain about his wife.\r\n\r\nI have a feeling that it can’t go on somehow, that something is\r\npreparing....\r\n\r\nHave I not again and again said that the time has come for action? Well,\r\nso here we are in the thick of it.\r\n\r\nI can’t remember if I told you anything about another friend of mine—a\r\nrelative of the Sipiagins. He will get himself into such a mess that it\r\nwon’t be easy for him to get out of it.\r\n\r\nI quite meant finishing this letter and am still going on. It seems to\r\nme that nothing matters and yet I scribble verses. I don’t read them to\r\nMariana and she is not very anxious to hear them, but you have sometimes\r\npraised my poor attempts and most of all you’ll keep them to yourself.\r\nI have been struck by a common phenomenon in Russia.... But, however, let\r\nthe verses speak for themselves—\r\n\r\n\r\nSLEEP\r\n\r\n     After long absence I return to my native land,\r\n     Finding no striking change there.\r\n     The same dead, senseless stagnation; crumbling houses, crumbling\r\n         walls,\r\n     And the same filth, dirt, poverty, and misery.\r\n     Unchanged the servile glance, now insolent, now dejected.\r\n     Free have our people become, and the free arm\r\n     Hangs as before like a whip unused.\r\n     All, all as before. In one thing only may we equal\r\n     Europe, Asia, and the World!\r\n     Never before has such a fearful sleep oppressed our land.\r\n\r\n     All are asleep, on all sides are they;\r\n     Through town and country, in carts and in sledges,\r\n     By day or night, sitting or standing,\r\n     The merchant and the official, and the sentinel at his post\r\n     In biting snow and burning heat—all sleep.\r\n     The judged ones doze, and the judge snores,\r\n     And peasants plough and reap like dead men,\r\n     Father, mother, children; all are asleep.\r\n     He who beats, and he who is beaten.\r\n     Alone the tavern of the tsar ne’er closes a relentless eye.\r\n     So, grasping tight in hand the bottle,\r\n     His brow at the Pole and his heel in the Caucasus,\r\n     Holy Russia, our fatherland, lies in eternal sleep.\r\n\r\nI am sorry, Vladimir. I never meant to write you such a melancholy\r\nletter without a few cheering words at the end. (You will no doubt\r\ntumble across some defects in the lines!) When shall I write to you\r\nagain? Shall I ever write? But whatever happens to me I am sure you will\r\nnever forget,\r\n\r\nYour devoted friend,\r\n\r\nA. N.\r\n\r\n_P.S._—Our people are asleep.... But I have a feeling that if anything\r\ndoes wake them, it will not be what we think....\r\n\r\nAfter writing the last line, Nejdanov flung down the pen. “Well, now\r\nyou must try and sleep and forget all this nonsense, scribbler!” he\r\nexclaimed, and lay down on the bed. But it was long before he fell\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Mariana woke him passing through his room on her way to\r\nTatiana. He had scarcely dressed when she came back. She seemed excited,\r\nher face expressing delight and anxiety at the same time.\r\n\r\n“Do you know, Aliosha, they say that in the province of T., quite near\r\nhere, it has already begun!”\r\n\r\n“What? What has begun? Who said so?”\r\n\r\n“Pavel. They say the peasants are rising, refusing to pay taxes,\r\ncollecting in mobs.”\r\n\r\n“Have you heard that yourself?”\r\n\r\n“Tatiana told me. But here is Pavel himself. You had better ask him.”\r\n\r\nPavel came in and confirmed what Mariana had said.\r\n\r\n“There is certainly some disturbance in T.,” he began, shaking his beard\r\nand screwing up his bright black eyes. “Sergai Mihailovitch must have\r\nhad a hand in it. He hasn’t been home for five days.”\r\n\r\nNejdanov took his cap.\r\n\r\n“Where are you off to?” Mariana asked.\r\n\r\n“Why there of course,” he replied, not raising his eyes and frowning, “I\r\nam going to T.”\r\n\r\n“Then I will come with you. You’ll take me, won’t you? Just let me get a\r\nshawl.”\r\n\r\n“It’s not a woman’s work,” Nejdanov said irritably with his eyes still\r\nfixed on the floor.\r\n\r\n“No, no! You do well to go, or Markelov would think you a coward ... but\r\nI’m coming with you.”\r\n\r\n“I am not a coward,” Nejdanov observed gloomily.\r\n\r\n“I meant to say that he would have thought us both cowards. I am coming\r\nwith you.”\r\n\r\nMariana went into her own room to get a shawl, while Pavel gave an\r\ninward ha, ha, and quickly vanished. He ran to warn Solomin.\r\n\r\nMariana had not yet appeared, when Solomin came into Nejdanov’s room.\r\nThe latter was standing with his face to the window, his forehead\r\nresting on the palm of his hand and his elbow on the window-pane.\r\nSolomin touched him on the shoulder. He turned around quickly;\r\ndishevelled and unwashed, Nejdanov had a strange wild look. Solomin,\r\ntoo, had changed during the last days. His face was yellow and drawn and\r\nhis upper front teeth showed slightly—he, too, seemed agitated as far\r\nas it was possible for his well-balanced temperament to be so.\r\n\r\n“Markelov could not control himself after all,” he began. “This may turn\r\nout badly both for him and for others.”\r\n\r\n“I want to go and see what’s going on there,” Nejdanov observed.\r\n\r\n“And I too,” Mariana added as she appeared in the doorway.\r\n\r\nSolomin turned to her quickly.\r\n\r\n“I would not advise you to go, Mariana. You may give yourself away—and\r\nus, without meaning to, and without the slightest necessity. Let\r\nNejdanov go and see how the land lies, if he wants to—and the sooner\r\nhe’s back the better! But why should you go?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t want to be parted from him.”\r\n\r\n“You will be in his way.”\r\n\r\nMariana looked at Nejdanov. He was standing motionless with a set sullen\r\nexpression on his face.\r\n\r\n“But supposing there should be danger?” she asked.\r\n\r\nSolomin smiled.\r\n\r\n“Don’t be afraid... when there’s danger I will let you go.”\r\n\r\nMariana took off her shawl without a word and sat down. Solomin then\r\nturned to Nejdanov.\r\n\r\n“It would be a good thing for you to look about a little, Alexai. I dare\r\nsay they exaggerate. Only do be careful. But, however, you will not\r\nbe going alone. Come back as quickly as you can. Will you promise?\r\nNejdanov? Will you promise?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“For certain?”\r\n\r\n“I suppose so, since everybody here obeys you, including Mariana.”\r\n\r\nNejdanov went out without saying goodbye. Pavel appeared from somewhere\r\nout of the darkness and ran down the stairs before him with a great\r\nclatter of his hob-nailed boots. Was _he_ then to accompany Nejdanov?\r\n\r\nSolomin sat down beside Mariana.\r\n\r\n“You heard Nejdanov’s last word?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. He is annoyed that I listen to you more than to him. But it’s\r\nquite true. I love _him_ and listen to you. He is dear to me... and you\r\nare near to me.”\r\n\r\nSolomin stroked her hand gently.\r\n\r\n“This is a very unpleasant business,” he observed at last. “If Markelov\r\nis mixed up in it then he’s a lost man.”\r\n\r\nMariana shuddered.\r\n\r\n“Lost?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. He doesn’t do things by halves—and won’t hide things for the sake\r\nof others.”\r\n\r\n“Lost!” Mariana whispered again as the tears rolled down her cheeks.\r\n“Oh, Vassily Fedotitch! I feel so sorry for him. But what makes you\r\nthink that he won’t succeed? Why must he inevitably be lost?”\r\n\r\n“Because in such enterprises the first always perish even if they come\r\noff victorious. And in this thing not only the first and second, but the\r\ntenth and twentieth will perish—”\r\n\r\n“Then we shall never live to see it?”\r\n\r\n“What you have in your mind—never. We shall never see it with our eyes;\r\nwith these living eyes of ours. But with our spiritual ... but that\r\nis another matter. We may see it in that way now; there is nothing to\r\nhinder us.”\r\n\r\n“Then why do you—”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“Why do you follow this road?”\r\n\r\n“Because there is no other. I mean that my aims are the same as\r\nMarkelov’s—but our paths are different.”\r\n\r\n“Poor Sergai Mihailovitch!” Mariana exclaimed sadly. Solomin passed his\r\nhand cautiously over hers.\r\n\r\n“There, there, we know nothing as yet. We’ll see what news Pavel brings\r\nback. In our calling one must be brave. The English have a proverb\r\n‘Never say die.’ A very good proverb, I think, much better than our\r\nRussian, ‘When trouble knocks, open the gates wide!’ We mustn’t meet\r\ntrouble half way.”\r\n\r\nSolomin stood up.\r\n\r\n“And the place you were going to find me?” Mariana asked suddenly. The\r\ntears were still shining on her cheeks, but there was no sadness in her\r\neyes. Solomin sat down again.\r\n\r\n“Are you in such a great hurry to get away from here?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no! Only I wanted to do something useful.”\r\n\r\n“You are useful here, Mariana. Don’t leave us yet, wait a little longer.\r\nWhat is it?” Solomin asked of Tatiana who was just coming in.\r\n\r\n“Some sort of female is asking for Alexai Dmitritch,” Tatiana replied,\r\nlaughing and gesticulating with her hands.\r\n\r\n“I said that there was no such person living here, that we did not know\r\nhim at all, when she—”\r\n\r\n“Who is she?”\r\n\r\n“Why the female of course. She wrote her name on this piece of paper\r\nand asked me to bring it here and let her in, saying that if Alexai\r\nDmitritch was really not at home, she could wait for him.”\r\n\r\nOn the paper was written in large letters “Mashurina.”\r\n\r\n“Show her in,” Solomin said. “You don’t mind my asking her in here,\r\nMariana, do you? She is also one of us.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all.”\r\n\r\nA few moments later Mashurina appeared in the doorway, in the same dress\r\nin which we saw her at the beginning of the first chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXI\r\n\r\n“Is Nejdanov not at home?” she asked, then catching sight of Solomin,\r\ncame up to him and extended her hand.\r\n\r\n“How do you do, Solomin?” She threw a side-glance at Mariana.\r\n\r\n“He will be back directly,” Solomin said. “But tell me how you came to\r\nknow—”\r\n\r\n“Markelov told me. Besides several people in the town already know that\r\nhe’s here.”\r\n\r\n“Really?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Somebody must have let it out. Besides Nejdanov has been\r\nrecognised.”\r\n\r\n“For all the dressing up!” Solomin muttered to himself. “Allow me to\r\nintroduce you,” he said aloud, “Miss Sinitska, Miss Mashurina! Won’t you\r\nsit down?”\r\n\r\nMashurina nodded her head slightly and sat down. “I have a letter for\r\nNejdanov and a message for you, Solomin.”\r\n\r\n“What message? And from whom?”\r\n\r\n“From someone who is well known to you.... Well, is everything ready\r\nhere?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing whatever.”\r\n\r\nMashurina opened her tiny eyes as wide as she could.\r\n\r\n“Nothing?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Absolutely nothing?”\r\n\r\n“Absolutely nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Is that what I am to say?”\r\n\r\n“Exactly.”\r\n\r\nMashurina became thoughtful and pulled a cigarette out of her pocket.\r\n\r\n“Can I have a light?”\r\n\r\n“Here is a match.”\r\n\r\nMashurina lighted her cigarette.\r\n\r\n“They expected something different,” she began, “Altogether different\r\nfrom what you have here. However, that is your affair. I am not going to\r\nstay long. I only want to see Nejdanov and give him the letter.”\r\n\r\n“Where are you going to?”\r\n\r\n“A long way from here.” (She was going to Geneva, but did not want\r\nSolomin to know as she did not quite trust him, and besides a stranger\r\nwas present. Mashurina, who scarcely knew a word of German, was being\r\nsent to Geneva to hand over to a person absolutely unknown to her a\r\npiece of cardboard with a vine-branch sketched on it and two hundred and\r\nseventy-nine roubles.)\r\n\r\n“And where is Ostrodumov? Is he with you?”\r\n\r\n“No, but he’s quite near. Got stuck on the way. He’ll be here when he’s\r\nwanted. Pemien can look after himself. There is no need to worry about\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\n“How did you get here?”\r\n\r\n“In a cart of course. How else could I have come? Give me another match,\r\nplease.”\r\n\r\nSolomin gave her a light.\r\n\r\n“Vassily Fedotitch!” A voice called out suddenly from the other side of\r\nthe door. “Can you come out?”\r\n\r\n“Who is it? What do you want?”\r\n\r\n“Do come, please,” the voice repeated insistently. “Some new workmen\r\nhave come. They’re trying to explain something, and Pavel Egoritch is\r\nnot there.”\r\n\r\nSolomin excused himself and went out. Mashurina fixed her gaze on\r\nMariana and stared at her for so long that the latter began to feel\r\nuncomfortable.\r\n\r\n“Excuse me,” Mashurina exclaimed suddenly in her hard abrupt voice, “I\r\nam a plain woman and don’t know how to put these things. Don’t be angry\r\nwith me. You need not tell me if you don’t wish to. Are you the girl who\r\nran away from the Sipiagins?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” Mariana replied, a little surprised.\r\n\r\n“With Nejdanov?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Please give me your hand... and forgive me. You must be good since he\r\nloves you.”\r\n\r\nMariana pressed Mashurina’s hand.\r\n\r\n“Have you known him long?”\r\n\r\n“I knew him in St. Petersburg. That was what made me talk to you. Sergai\r\nMihailovitch has also told me—”\r\n\r\n“Oh Markelov! Is it long since you’ve seen him?”\r\n\r\n“No, not long. But he’s gone away now.”\r\n\r\n“Where to?”\r\n\r\n“Where he was ordered.”\r\n\r\nMariana sighed.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Miss Mashurina, I fear for him.”\r\n\r\n“In the first place, I’m not miss. You ought to cast off such manners.\r\nIn the second, you say... ‘I fear,’ and that you must also cast\r\naside. If you do not fear for yourself, you will leave off fearing\r\nfor others. You must not think of yourself, nor fear for yourself. I\r\ndare say it’s easy for me to talk like that. I am ugly, while you are\r\nbeautiful. It must be so much harder for you.” (Mariana looked down and\r\nturned away.) “Sergai Mihailovitch told me.... He knew I had a letter\r\nfor Nejdanov.... ‘Don’t go to the factory,’ he said, ‘don’t take the\r\nletter. It will upset everything there. Leave them alone! They are\r\nboth happy.... Don’t interfere with them!’ I should be glad not to\r\ninterfere, but what shall I do about the letter?”\r\n\r\n“Give it to him by all means,” Mariana put in. “How awfully good\r\nSergai Mihailovitch is! Will they kill him, Mashurina... or send him to\r\nSiberia?”\r\n\r\n“Well, what then? Don’t people come back from Siberia? And as for losing\r\none’s life; it is not all like honey to everybody. To some it is sweet,\r\nto others bitter. His life has not been over-sweet.”\r\n\r\nMashurina gave Mariana a fixed searching look.\r\n\r\n“How beautiful you are!” she exclaimed, “just like a bird! I don’t think\r\nAlexai is coming.... I’ll give you the letter. It’s no use waiting any\r\nlonger.”\r\n\r\n“I will give it him, you may be sure.”\r\n\r\nMashurina rested her cheek in her hand and for a long, long time did not\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\n“Tell me,” she began, “forgive me for asking... do you love him?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nMashurina shook her heavy head.\r\n\r\n“There is no need to ask if he loves you. However, I had better be\r\ngoing, otherwise I shall be late. Tell him that I was here... give him\r\nmy kind regards. Tell him Mashurina was here. You won’t forget my name,\r\nwill you? Mashurina. And the letter... but say, where have I put it?”\r\n\r\nMashurina stood up, turned round as though she were rummaging in her\r\npockets for the letter, and quickly raising a small piece of folded\r\npaper to her lips, swallowed it. “Oh, dear me! What have I done with\r\nit? Have I lost it? I must have dropped it. Dear me! Supposing some one\r\nshould find it! I can’t find it anywhere. It’s turned out exactly as\r\nSergai Mihailovitch wanted after all!”\r\n\r\n“Look again,” Mariana whispered. Mashurina waved her hand.\r\n\r\n“It’s no good. I’ve lost it.”\r\n\r\nMariana came up to her.\r\n\r\n“Well, then, kiss me.”\r\n\r\nMashurina suddenly put her arms about Mariana and pressed her to her\r\nbosom with more than a woman’s strength.\r\n\r\n“I would not have done this for anybody,” she said, a lump rising in her\r\nthroat, “against my conscience ... the first time! Tell him to be more\r\ncareful.... And you too. Be cautious. It will soon be very dangerous\r\nfor everybody here, very dangerous. You had better both go away, while\r\nthere’s still time.... Goodbye!” she added loudly with some severity.\r\n“Just one more thing ... tell him ... no, it’s not necessary. It’s\r\nnothing.”\r\n\r\nMashurina went out, banging the door behind her, while Mariana stood\r\nperplexed in the middle of the room.\r\n\r\n“What does it all mean?” she exclaimed at last. “This woman loves him\r\nmore than I do! What did she want to convey by her hints? And why did\r\nSolomin disappear so suddenly, and why didn’t he come back again?”\r\n\r\nShe began pacing up and down the room. A curious sensation of fear,\r\nannoyance, and amazement took possession of her. Why did she not go with\r\nNejdanov? Solomin had persuaded her not to... but where is Solomin? And\r\nwhat is going on around here? Of course Mashurina did not give her the\r\nletter because of her love for Nejdanov. But how could she decide to\r\ndisregard orders? Did she want to appear magnanimous? What right had\r\nshe? And why was she, Mariana, so touched by her act? An unattractive\r\nwoman interests herself in a young man.... What is there extraordinary\r\nabout it? And why should Mashurina assume that Mariana’s attachment to\r\nNejdanov is stronger than the feelings of duty? And did Mariana ask for\r\nsuch a sacrifice? And what could the letter have contained? A call for\r\nspeedy action? Well, and what then?\r\n\r\nAnd Markelov? He is in danger ... and what are we doing? Markelov spares\r\nus both, gives us the opportunity of being happy, does not part us....\r\nWhat makes him do it? Is it also magnaminity ... or contempt?\r\n\r\nAnd did we run away from that hateful house merely to live like turtle\r\ndoves?\r\n\r\nThus Mariana pondered, while the feeling of agitation and annoyance grew\r\nstronger and stronger within her. Her pride was hurt. Why had everyone\r\nforsaken her? _Everyone._ This stout woman had called her a bird, a\r\nbeauty ... why not quite plainly, a doll? And why did Nejdanov not go\r\nalone, but with Pavel? It’s just as if he needed someone to look after\r\nhim! And what are really Solomin’s convictions? It’s quite clear that\r\nhe’s not a revolutionist! And could any one really think that he does\r\nnot treat the whole thing seriously?\r\n\r\nThese were the thoughts that whirled round, chasing one another and\r\nbecoming entangled in Mariana’s feverish brain. Pressing her lips\r\nclosely together and folding her arms like a man, she sat down by the\r\nwindow at last and remained immovable, straight up in her chair, all\r\nalertness and intensity, ready to spring up at any moment. She had no\r\ndesire to go to Tatiana and work; she wanted to wait alone. And she sat\r\nwaiting obstinately, almost angrily. From time to time her mood seemed\r\nstrange and incomprehensible even to herself.... Never mind. “Am I\r\njealous?” flashed across her mind, but remembering poor Mashurina’s\r\nfigure she shrugged her shoulders and dismissed the idea.\r\n\r\nMariana had been waiting for a long time when suddenly she heard the\r\nsound of two persons’ footsteps coming up the stairs. She fixed her\r\neyes on the door... the steps drew nearer. The door opened and Nejdanov,\r\nsupported under the arm by Pavel, appeared in the doorway. He was deadly\r\npale, without a cap, his dishevelled hair hung in wet tufts over his\r\nforehead, he stared vacantly straight in front of him. Pavel helped him\r\nacross the room (Nejdanov’s legs were weak and shaky) and made him sit\r\ndown on the couch.\r\n\r\nMariana sprang up from her seat.\r\n\r\n“What is the meaning of this? What’s the matter with him? Is he ill?”\r\n\r\nAs he settled Nejdanov, Pavel answered her with a smile, looking at her\r\nover his shoulder.\r\n\r\n“You needn’t worry. He’ll soon be all right. It’s only because he’s not\r\nused to it.”\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter?” Mariana persisted.\r\n\r\n“He’s only a little tipsy. Been drinking on an empty stomach; that’s\r\nall.”\r\n\r\nMariana bent over Nejdanov. He was half lying on the couch, his head\r\nsunk on his breast, his eyes closed. He smelled of vodka; he was quite\r\ndrunk.\r\n\r\n“Alexai!” escaped her lips.\r\n\r\nHe raised his heavy eyelids with difficulty, and tried to smile.\r\n\r\n“Well, Mariana!” he stammered out, “you’ve always talked of\r\nsim-plif-ication... so here I am quite simplified. Because the people\r\nare always drunk... and so...”\r\n\r\nHe ceased, then muttered something indistinctly to himself, closed his\r\neyes, and fell asleep. Pavel stretched him carefully on the couch.\r\n\r\n“Don’t worry, Mariana Vikentievna,” he repeated. “He’ll sleep an hour or\r\ntwo and wake up as fresh as can be.”\r\n\r\nMariana wanted to ask how this had happened, but her questions would\r\nhave detained Pavel and she wanted to be alone... she did not wish Pavel\r\nto see him in this disgusting state before her. She walked away to the\r\nwindow while Pavel, who instantly understood her, carefully covered\r\nNejdanov’s legs with the skirts of his coat, put a pillow under his\r\nhead, and observing once again, “It’s nothing,” went out on tiptoe.\r\n\r\nMariana looked round. Nejdanov’s head was buried in the pillow and on\r\nhis pale face there was an expression of fixed intensity as on the face\r\nof one dangerously ill.\r\n\r\n“I wonder how it happened?” she thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXII\r\n\r\nIt happened like this.\r\n\r\nSitting down beside Pavel in the cart, Nejdanov fell into a state of\r\ngreat excitement. As soon as they rolled out of the courtyard onto the\r\nhigh road leading to T. he began shouting out the most absurd things to\r\nthe peasants he met on the way. “Why are you asleep? Rouse yourself! The\r\ntime has come! Down with the taxes! Down with the landlords!”\r\n\r\nSome of the peasants stared at him in amazement, others passed on\r\nwithout taking any notice of him, thinking that he was drunk; one even\r\nsaid when he got home that he had met a Frenchman on the way who was\r\njabbering away at something he did not understand. Nejdanov had common\r\nsense enough to know that what he was doing was unutterably stupid and\r\nabsurd had he not got himself up to such a pitch of excitement that he\r\nwas no longer able to discriminate between sense and nonsense. Pavel\r\ntried to quiet him, saying that it was impossible to go on like that;\r\nthat they were quite near a large village, the first on the borders of\r\nT., and that there they could look round.... But Nejdanov would not\r\ncalm down, and at the same time his face bore a sad, almost despairing,\r\nexpression. Their horse was an energetic, round little thing, with a\r\nclipped mane on its scraggy neck. It tugged at the reins, and its strong\r\nlittle legs flew as fast as they could, just as if it were conscious\r\nof bearing important people to the scene of action. Just before they\r\nreached the village, Nejdanov saw a group of about eight peasants\r\nstanding by the side of the road at the closed doors of a granary. He\r\ninstantly jumped out of the cart, rushed up to them, and began shouting\r\nat them, thumping his fists and gesticulating for about five minutes.\r\nThe words “For Freedom! March on! Put the shoulder to the wheel!” could\r\nbe distinguished from among the rest of his confused words.\r\n\r\nThe peasants, who had met before the granary for the purpose of\r\ndiscussing how to fill it once more—if only to show that they\r\nwere doing something (it was the communal granary and consequently\r\nempty)—fixed their eyes on Nejdanov and seemed to listen to him with\r\nthe greatest attention, but they had evidently not understood a word he\r\nhad said, for no sooner was his back turned, shouting for the last time\r\n“Freedom!” as he rushed away, when one of them, the most sagacious of\r\nthe lot, shook his head saying, “What a severe one!” “He must be an\r\nofficer,” another remarked, to which the wise one said: “We know all\r\nabout that—he doesn’t talk for nothing. We’ll have to pay the piper.”\r\n\r\n“Heavens! what nonsense this all is!” Nejdanov thought to himself, as he\r\nsat down next to Pavel in the cart. “But then none of us know how to get\r\nat the people—perhaps this is the right way after all! Who knows? Go\r\non! Does your heart ache? Let it!”\r\n\r\nThey found themselves in the main street of the village in the middle\r\nof which a number of people were gathered together before a tavern.\r\nNejdanov, paying no heed to Pavel, who was trying to hold him back,\r\nleapt down from the cart with a cry of “Brothers!” The crowd made way\r\nfor him and he again began preaching, looking neither to right nor left,\r\nas if furious and weeping at the same time. But things turned out quite\r\ndifferently than with his former attempt at the barn. An enormous fellow\r\nwith a clean-shaven, vicious face, in a short greasy coat, high boots,\r\nand a sheepskin cap, came up to him and clapped him on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n“All right! my fine fellow!” he bawled out in a wheezy voice; “but\r\nwait a bit! good deeds must be rewarded. Come along in here. It’ll be\r\nmuch better talking in there.” He pulled Nejdanov into the tavern,\r\nthe others streamed in after them. “Michaitch!” the fellow shouted,\r\n“twopennyworth! My favourite drink! I want to treat a friend. Who he\r\nis, what’s his family, and where he’s from, only the devil knows!\r\nDrink!” he said, turning to Nejdanov and handing him a heavy, full\r\nglass, wet all over on the outside, as though perspiring, “drink, if\r\nyou really have any feeling for us!” “Drink!” came a chorus of voices.\r\nNejdanov, who seemed as if in a fever, seized the glass and with a\r\ncry of “I drink to you, children!” drank it off at a gulp. Ugh! He\r\ndrank it off with the same desperate heroism with which he would have\r\nflung himself in storming a battery or on a line of bayonets. But what\r\nwas happening to him? Something seemed to have struck his spine, his\r\nlegs, burned his throat, his chest, his stomach, made the tears come\r\ninto his eyes. A shudder of disgust passed all over him. He began\r\nshouting at the top of his voice to drown the throbbing in his head.\r\nThe dark tavern room suddenly became hot and thick and suffocating—and\r\npeople, people everywhere! Nejdanov began talking, talking incessantly,\r\nshouting furiously, in exasperation, shaking broad rough hands, kissing\r\nprickly beards. ... The enormous fellow in the greasy coat kissed him\r\ntoo, nearly breaking his ribs. This fellow turned out to be a perfect\r\nfiend. “I’ll wring the neck,” he shouted, “I’ll wring the neck of\r\nanyone who dares to offend our brother! And what’s more, I’ll make\r\nmincemeat of him too... I’ll make him cry out! That’s nothing to me.\r\nI was a butcher and know how to do such jobs!” At this he held up an\r\nenormous fist covered with freckles. Someone again shouted, “Drink!”\r\nand Nejdanov again swallowed a glass of the filthy poison. But this\r\nsecond time was truly awful! Blunt hooks seemed to be tearing him to\r\npieces inside. His head was in a whirl, green circles swam before his\r\neyes. A hubbub arose... Oh horror! a third glass. Was it possible he\r\nemptied that too? He seemed to be surrounded by purple noses, dusty\r\nheads of hair, tanned necks covered with nets of wrinkles. Rough hands\r\nseized him. “Go on!” they bawled out in angry voices, “talk away! The\r\nday before yesterday another stranger talked like that. Go on....” The\r\nearth seemed reeling under Nejdanov’s feet, his voice sounded strange\r\nto his own ears as though coming from a long way off.... Was it death\r\nor what?\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly he felt the fresh air blowing about his face, no more\r\npushing and shoving, no more stench of spirits, sheep-skin, tar, nor\r\nleather.... He was again sitting beside Pavel in the cart, struggling at\r\nfirst and shouting, “Where are you off to? Stop! I haven’t had time to\r\ntell them anything—I must explain...” and then added, “and what are\r\nyour own ideas on the subject, you sly-boots?”\r\n\r\n“It would certainly be well if there were no gentry and the land\r\nbelonged to us, of course,” Pavel replied, “but there’s been no such\r\norder from the government.” He quietly turned the horse’s head and,\r\nsuddenly lashing it on the back with the reins, set off at full gallop,\r\naway from this din and uproar, back to the factory.\r\n\r\nNejdanov sat dozing, rocked by the motion of the cart, while the\r\nwind played pleasantly about his face and kept back gloomy depressing\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\nHe was annoyed that he had not been allowed to say all that he had\r\nwanted to say.... Again the wind caressed his overheated face.\r\n\r\nAnd then—a momentary glimpse of Mariana—a burning sense of shame—and\r\nsleep, deep, sound sleep....\r\n\r\nPavel told Solomin all this afterwards, not hiding the fact that he did\r\nnot attempt to prevent Nejdanov from drinking—otherwise he could not\r\nhave got him out of the whirl. The others would not have let him go.\r\n\r\n“When he seemed to be getting very feeble, I asked them to let him off,\r\nand they agreed to, on condition that I gave them a shilling, so I gave\r\nit them.”\r\n\r\n“You acted quite rightly,” Solomin said, approvingly.\r\n\r\nNejdanov slept, while Mariana sat at the window looking out into the\r\ngarden. Strange to say the angry, almost wicked, thoughts that had\r\nbeen tormenting her until Nejdanov and Pavel arrived had completely\r\ndisappeared. Nejdanov himself was not in the least repulsive or\r\ndisgusting to her; she was only sorry for him. She knew quite well that\r\nhe was not a debauchee, a drunkard, and was wondering what she would say\r\nto him when he woke up; something friendly and affectionate to minimise\r\nthe first sting of conscience and shame. “I must try and get him to tell\r\nme himself how it all happened,” she thought.\r\n\r\nShe was not disturbed, but depressed—hopelessly depressed. It seemed\r\nas if a breath of the real atmosphere of the world towards which she was\r\nstriving had blown on her suddenly, making her shudder at its coarseness\r\nand darkness. What Moloch was this to which she was going to sacrifice\r\nherself?\r\n\r\nBut no! It could not be! This was merely an incident, it would soon pass\r\nover. A momentary impression that had struck her so forcibly because it\r\nhad happened so unexpectedly. She got up, walked over to the couch on\r\nwhich Nejdanov was lying, took out her pocket-handkerchief and wiped his\r\npale forehead, which was painfully drawn, even in sleep, and smoothed\r\nback his hair....\r\n\r\nShe pitied him as a mother pities her suffering child. But it was\r\nsomewhat painful for her to look at him, so she went quietly into her\r\nown room, leaving the door unlocked.\r\n\r\nShe did not attempt to take any work in her hand. She sat down and\r\nthoughts began crowding in upon her. She felt how the time was slipping\r\naway, how one minute flew after another, and the sensation was even\r\npleasant to her. Her heart beat fast and again she seemed to be waiting\r\nfor something.\r\n\r\nWhat has become of Solomin?\r\n\r\nThe door creaked softly and Tatiana came into the room. “What do you\r\nwant?” Mariana asked with a shade of annoyance.\r\n\r\n“Mariana Vikentievna,” Tatiana began in an undertone, “don’t worry, my\r\ndear. Such things happen every day. Besides, the Lord be thanked—”\r\n\r\n“I am not worrying at all, Tatiana Osipovna,” Mariana interrupted her.\r\n“Alexai Dmitritch is a little indisposed, nothing very serious!”\r\n\r\n“That’s all right! I wondered why you didn’t come, and thought there\r\nmight be something the matter with you. But still I wouldn’t have come\r\nin to you. It’s always best not to interfere. But someone has come—a\r\nlittle lame man, the Lord knows who he is—and demands to see Alexai\r\nDmitritch! I wonder what for? This morning that female came for him and\r\nnow this little cripple. ‘If Alexai Dmitritch is not at home,’ he says,\r\n‘then I must see Vassily Fedotitch! I won’t go away without seeing him.\r\nIt’s on a very urgent matter.’ We wanted to get rid of him, as we did\r\nof that woman, told him Vassily Fedotitch was not at home, but he is\r\ndetermined to see him even if he has to wait until midnight. There he\r\nis walking about in the yard. Come and have a look at him through the\r\nlittle window in the corridor. Perhaps you’ll recognise him.”\r\n\r\nMariana followed Tatiana out into the corridor, and on passing Nejdanov\r\nwas again struck by that painful frown on his forehead and passed her\r\npocket-handkerchief over it a second time.\r\n\r\nThrough the dusty little window she caught a glimpse of the visitor whom\r\nTatiana had spoken of. He was unknown to her. At this moment Solomin\r\nappeared from a corner of the house.\r\n\r\nThe little cripple rushed up to him and extended his hand. Solomin\r\npressed it. He was obviously acquainted with him. They both\r\ndisappeared.... Soon their footsteps were heard coming up the stairs.\r\nThey were coming to see her....\r\n\r\nMariana fled into her own room and remained standing in the middle of\r\nit, hardly able to breathe. She was mortally afraid... but of what? She\r\ndid not know herself.\r\n\r\nSolomin’s head appeared through the door.\r\n\r\n“Mariana Vikentievna, can I come in? I have brought someone whom it’s\r\nabsolutely necessary for you to see.”\r\n\r\nMariana merely nodded her head in reply and behind Solomin in\r\nwalked—Paklin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIII\r\n\r\n“I am a friend of your husband’s,” he said, bowing very low, as if\r\nanxious to conceal his frightened face, “and also of Vassily Fedotitch.\r\nI hear Alexai Dmitritch is asleep and not very well. Unfortunately, I\r\nhave brought bad news. I have already told Vassily Fedotitch something\r\nabout it and am afraid decisive measures will have to be taken.”\r\n\r\nPaklin’s voice broke continually, like that of a man who was tortured\r\nby thirst. The items of news he had to communicate were certainly very\r\nunpleasant ones. Some peasants had seized Markelov and brought him to\r\nthe town. The stupid clerk had betrayed Golushkin, who was now under\r\narrest, he in his turn was betraying everything and everybody, wanted to\r\ngo over to the Orthodox Church, had offered to present a portrait of the\r\nBishop Filaret to the public school, and had already given five thousand\r\nroubles to be distributed among crippled soldiers. There was not a\r\nshadow of a doubt that he had informed against Nejdanov; the police\r\nmight make a raid upon the factory any moment. Vassily Fedotitch was\r\nalso in danger. “As for myself,” Paklin added, “I am surprised that\r\nI’m still allowed to roam at large, although it’s true that I’ve never\r\nreally interested myself in practical politics or taken part in any\r\nschemes. I have taken advantage of this oversight on the part of the\r\npolice to put you on your guard and find out what had best be done to\r\navoid any unpleasantness.”\r\n\r\nMariana listened to Paklin to the end. She did not seem alarmed; on the\r\nother hand she was quite calm. But something must really be done! She\r\nfixed her eyes on Solomin.\r\n\r\nHe was also composed; only around his lips there was the faintest\r\nmovement of the muscles; but it was not his habitual smile.\r\n\r\nSolomin understood the meaning of Mariana’s glance; she waited for him\r\nto say what had best be done.\r\n\r\n“It’s a very awkward business,” he began; “I don’t think it would do\r\nNejdanov any harm to go into hiding for a time. But, by the way, how did\r\nyou get to know that he was here, Mr. Paklin?”\r\n\r\nPaklin gave a wave of the hand.\r\n\r\n“A certain individual told me. He had seen him preaching about the\r\nneighbourhood and had followed him, though with no evil intent. He is a\r\nsympathiser. Excuse me,” he added, turning to Mariana, “is it true that\r\nour friend Nejdanov has been very... very careless?”\r\n\r\n“It’s no good blaming him now,” Solomin began again. “What a pity we\r\ncan’t talk things over with him now, but by tomorrow he will be all\r\nright again. The police don’t do things as quickly as you seem to\r\nimagine. You will have to go away with him, Mariana Vikentievna.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” she said resolutely, a lump rising in her throat.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” Solomin said, “we must think it over, consider ways and means.”\r\n\r\n“May I make a suggestion?” Paklin began. “It entered my head as I was\r\ncoming along here. I must tell you, by the way, that I dismissed the\r\ncabman from the town a mile away from here.”\r\n\r\n“What is your suggestion?” Solomin asked.\r\n\r\n“Let me have some horses at once and I’ll gallop off to the Sipiagins.”\r\n\r\n“To the Sipiagins!” Mariana exclaimed. “Why?”\r\n\r\n“You will see.”\r\n\r\n“But do you know them?”\r\n\r\n“Not at all! But listen. Do think over my suggestion thoroughly. It\r\nseems to me a brilliant one. Markelov is Sipiagin’s brother-in-law,\r\nhis wife’s brother, isn’t that so? Would this gentleman really make\r\nno attempt to save him? And as for Nejdanov himself, granting that Mr.\r\nSipiagin is most awfully angry with him, still he has become a relation\r\nof his by marrying you. And the danger hanging over our friend—”\r\n\r\n“I am not married,” Mariana observed.\r\n\r\nPaklin started.\r\n\r\n“What? Haven’t managed it all this time! Well, never mind,” he added,\r\n“one can pretend a little. All the same, you will get married directly.\r\nThere seems nothing else to be done! Take into consideration the fact\r\nthat up until now Sipiagin has not persecuted you, which shows him to\r\nbe a man capable of a certain amount of generosity. I see that you don’t\r\nlike the expression—well, a certain amount of pride. Why should we not\r\ntake advantage of it? Consider for yourself!”\r\n\r\nMariana raised her head and passed her hand through her hair.\r\n\r\n“You can take advantage of whatever you like for Markelov, Mr. Paklin...\r\nor for yourself, but Alexai and I do not desire the protection or\r\npatronage of Mr. Sipiagin. We did not leave his house only to go\r\nknocking at his door as beggars. The pride and generosity of Mr.\r\nSipiagin and his wife have nothing whatever to do with us!”\r\n\r\n“Such sentiments are extremely praiseworthy,” Paklin replied (“How\r\nutterly crushed!” he thought to himself), “though, on the other hand, if\r\nyou think of it.... However, I am ready to obey you. I will exert myself\r\nonly on Markelov’s account, our good Markelov! I must say, however,\r\nthat he is not his blood relation, but only related to him through his\r\nwife—whilst you——”\r\n\r\n“Mr Paklin, I beg of you!”\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry.... Only I can’t tell you how disappointing it is—Sipiagin is\r\na very influential man.”\r\n\r\n“Have you no fears for yourself?” Solomin asked.\r\n\r\nPaklin drew himself up.\r\n\r\n“There are moments when one must not think of oneself!” he said proudly.\r\nAnd he was thinking of himself all the while. Poor little man! he wanted\r\nto run away as fast as he could. On the strength of the service rendered\r\nhim, Sipiagin might, if need be, speak a word in his favour. For\r\nhe too—say what he would—was implicated, he had listened and had\r\nchattered a little himself.\r\n\r\n“I don’t think your suggestion is a bad one,” Solomin observed at last,\r\n“although there is not much hope of success. At any rate there is no harm\r\nin trying.”\r\n\r\n“Of course not. Supposing they pitch me out by the scruff of the neck,\r\nwhat harm will it do?”\r\n\r\n“That won’t matter very much” (“_Merci_,” Paklin thought to himself).\r\n“What is the time?” Solomin asked. “Five o’clock. We mustn’t dawdle. You\r\nshall have the horses directly. Pavel!”\r\n\r\nBut instead of Pavel, Nejdanov appeared in the doorway. He staggered\r\nand steadied himself on the doorpost. He opened his mouth feebly, looked\r\naround with his glassy eyes, comprehending nothing. Paklin was the first\r\nto approach him.\r\n\r\n“Aliosha!” he exclaimed, “don’t you know me?” Nejdanov stared at him,\r\nblinking slowly.\r\n\r\n“Paklin?” he said at last.\r\n\r\n“Yes, it is I. Aren’t you well?”\r\n\r\n“No... I’m not well. But why are you here?”\r\n\r\n“Why?”... But at this moment Mariana stealthily touched Paklin on the\r\nelbow. He turned around and saw that she was making signs to him. “Oh,\r\nyes!” he muttered. “Yes.... You see, Aliosha,” he added aloud, “I’ve\r\ncome here upon a very important matter and must go away at once. Solomin\r\nwill tell you all about it—and Mariana—Mariana Vikentievna. They both\r\nfully approve of what I am going to do. The thing concerns us all. No,\r\nno,” he put in hastily in response to a look and gesture from Mariana.\r\n“The thing concerns Markelov; our mutual friend Markelov; it concerns\r\nhim alone. But I must say goodbye now. Every minute is precious.\r\nGoodbye, Aliosha.... We’ll see each other again sometime. Vassily\r\nFedotitch, can you come with me to see about the horses?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly. Mariana, I wanted to ask you to be firm, but that is not\r\nnecessary. You’re a brick!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes,” Paklin chimed in, “you are just like a Roman maiden in\r\nCato’s time! Cato of Utica! We must be off, Vassily Fedotitch, come\r\nalong!”\r\n\r\n“There’s plenty of time,” Solomin observed with a faint smile. Nejdanov\r\nstood on one side to allow them room to pass out, but there was the same\r\nvacant expression in his eyes. After they had gone he took a step or two\r\nforward and sat down on a chair facing Mariana.\r\n\r\n“Alexai,” she began, “everything has been found out. Markelov has been\r\nseized by the very peasants he was trying to better, and is now under\r\narrest in this town, and so is the merchant with whom you dined once.\r\nI dare say the police will soon be here for us too. Paklin has gone to\r\nSipiagin.”\r\n\r\n“Why?” Nejdanov asked in a scarcely audible whisper. But there was a\r\nkeen look in his eyes—his face assumed it’s habitual expression. The\r\nstupor had left him instantly.\r\n\r\n“To try and find out if he would be willing to intercede.”\r\n\r\nNejdanov sat up straight.\r\n\r\n“For us?”\r\n\r\n“No, for Markelov. He wanted to ask him to intercede for us too... but\r\nI wouldn’t let him. Have I done well, Alexai?”\r\n\r\n“Have you done well?” Nejdanov asked and without rising from his chair,\r\nstretched out his arms to her. “Have you done well?” he repeated,\r\ndrawing her close to him, and pressing his face against her waist,\r\nsuddenly burst into tears.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter? What is the matter with you?” Mariana exclaimed.\r\nAnd as on the day when he had fallen on his knees before her, trembling\r\nand breathless in a torrent of passion, she laid both her hands on his\r\ntrembling head. But what she felt now was quite different from what she\r\nhad felt then. Then she had given herself up to him—had submitted to\r\nhim and only waited to hear what he would say next, but now she pitied\r\nhim and only wondered what she could do to calm him.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter with you?” she repeated. “Why are you crying? Not\r\nbecause you came home in a somewhat... strange condition? It can’t be!\r\nOr are you sorry for Markelov—afraid for me, for yourself? Or is it for\r\nour lost hopes? You did not really expect that everything would go off\r\nsmoothly!”\r\n\r\nNejdanov suddenly lifted his head.\r\n\r\n“It’s not that, Mariana,” he said, mastering his sobs by an effort, “I\r\nam not afraid for either of us... but... I am sorry——”\r\n\r\n“For whom?”\r\n\r\n“For you, Mariana! I am sorry that you should have united your fate with\r\na man who is not worthy of you.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“If only because he can be crying at a moment as this!”\r\n\r\n“It is not you but your nerves that are crying!”\r\n\r\n“You can’t separate me from my nerves! But listen, Mariana, look me in\r\nthe face; can you tell me now that you do not regret—”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“That you ran away with me.”\r\n\r\n“No!”\r\n\r\n“And would you go with me further? Anywhere?”\r\n\r\n“Yes!”\r\n\r\n“Really? Mariana... really?\r\n\r\n“Yes. I have given you my word, and so long as you remain the man I\r\nlove—I shall not take it back.”\r\n\r\nNejdanov remained sitting on the chair, Mariana standing before him. His\r\narms were about her waist, her’s were resting on his shoulders.\r\n\r\n“Yes, no,” Nejdanov thought... “when I last held her in my arms like\r\nthis, her body was at least motionless, but now I can feel it—against\r\nher will, perhaps—shrink away from me gently!”\r\n\r\nHe loosened his arms and Mariana did in fact move away from him a\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\n“If that’s so,” he said aloud, “if we must run away from here before the\r\npolice find us... I think it wouldn’t be a bad thing if we were to get\r\nmarried. We may not find another such accommodating priest as Father\r\nZosim!”\r\n\r\n“I am quite ready,” Mariana observed.\r\n\r\nNejdanov gave her a searching glance.\r\n\r\n“A Roman maiden!” he exclaimed with a sarcastic half-smile. “What a\r\nfeeling of duty!”\r\n\r\nMariana shrugged her shoulders.\r\n\r\n“We must tell Solomin.”\r\n\r\n“Yes... Solomin...” Nejdanov drawled out. “But he is also in danger. The\r\npolice would arrest him too. It seems to me that he also took part in\r\nthings and knew even more than we did.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know about that,” Mariana observed. “He never speaks of\r\nhimself!”\r\n\r\n“Not as I do!” Nejdanov thought. “That was what she meant to imply.\r\nSolomin... Solomin!” he added after a pause. “Do you know, Mariana, I\r\nshould not be at all sorry if you had linked your fate forever with a\r\nman like Solomin... or with Solomin himself.”\r\n\r\nMariana gave Nejdanov a penetrating glance in her turn. “You had no\r\nright to say that,” she observed at last.\r\n\r\n“I had no right! In what sense am I to take that? Does it mean that\r\nyou love me, or that I ought not to touch upon this question generally\r\nspeaking?”\r\n\r\n“You had no right,” Mariana repeated.\r\n\r\nNejdanov lowered his head.\r\n\r\n“Mariana!” he exclaimed in a slightly different tone of voice.\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“If I were to ask you now ... now ... you know what.... But no, I will\r\nnot ask anything of you ... goodbye.”\r\n\r\nHe got up and went out; Mariana did not detain him. Nejdanov sat down on\r\nthe couch and covered his face with his hands. He was afraid of his own\r\nthoughts and tried to stop thinking. He felt that some sort of dark,\r\nunderground hand had clutched at the very root of his being and would\r\nnot let him go. He knew that the dear, sweet creature he had left in\r\nthe next room would not come out to him and he dared not go to her. What\r\nfor? What would he say to her?\r\n\r\nFirm, rapid footsteps made him open his eyes. Solomin passed through his\r\nroom, knocked at Mariana’s door, and went in.\r\n\r\n“Honour where honour is due!” Nejdanov whispered bitterly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIV\r\n\r\nIt was already ten o’clock in the evening; in the drawing-room of the\r\nArjanov house Sipiagin, his wife, and Kollomietzev were sitting over\r\na game at cards when a footman entered and announced that an unknown\r\ngentleman, a certain Mr. Paklin, wished to see Boris Andraevitch upon a\r\nvery urgent business.\r\n\r\n“So late!” Valentina Mihailovna exclaimed, surprised.\r\n\r\n“What?” Boris Andraevitch asked, screwing up his handsome nose; “what did\r\nyou say the gentleman’s name was?”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Paklin, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Paklin!” Kollomietzev exclaimed; “a real country name. Paklin ...\r\nSolomin ... _De vrais noms ruraux, hein?_”\r\n\r\n“Did you say,” Boris Andraevitch continued, still turned towards the\r\nfootman with his nose screwed up, “that the business was an urgent one?”\r\n\r\n“The gentleman said so, sir.”\r\n\r\n“H’m.... No doubt some beggar or intriguer.”\r\n\r\n“Or both,” Kollomietzev chimed in.\r\n\r\n“Very likely. Ask him into my study.” Boris Andraevitch got up. “_Pardon,\r\nma bonne._ Have a game of écarté till I come back, unless you would like\r\nto wait for me. I won’t be long.”\r\n\r\n_“Nous causerons.... Allez!”_ Kollomietzev said.\r\n\r\nWhen Sipiagin entered his study and caught sight of Paklin’s poor,\r\nfeeble little figure meekly leaning up against the door between the wall\r\nand the fireplace, he was seized by that truly ministerial sensation of\r\nhaughty compassion and fastidious condescension so characteristic of the\r\nSt. Petersburg bureaucrat. “Heavens! What a miserable little wretch!” he\r\nthought; “and lame too, I believe!”\r\n\r\n“Sit down, please,” he said aloud, making use of some of his most\r\nbenevolent baritone notes and throwing back his head, sat down before\r\nhis guest did. “You are no doubt tired from the journey. Sit down,\r\nplease, and tell me about this important matter that has brought you so\r\nlate.”\r\n\r\n“Your excellency,” Paklin began, cautiously dropping into an arm-chair,\r\n“I have taken the liberty of coming to you—”\r\n\r\n“Just a minute, please,” Sipiagin interrupted him, “I think I’ve seen\r\nyou before. I never forget faces. But er... er... really... where have I\r\nseen you?”\r\n\r\n“You are not mistaken, your excellency. I had the honour of meeting\r\nyou in St. Petersburg at a certain person’s who... who has since...\r\nunfortunately... incurred your displeasure—”\r\n\r\nSipiagin jumped up from his chair.\r\n\r\n“Why, at Mr. Nejdanov’s? I remember now. You haven’t come from him by\r\nthe way, have you?”\r\n\r\n“Not at all, your excellency; on the contrary...I—”\r\n\r\nSipiagin sat down again.\r\n\r\n“That’s good. For had you come on his account I should have asked you to\r\nleave the house at once. I cannot allow any mediator between myself\r\nand Mr. Nejdanov. Mr. Nejdanov has insulted me in a way which cannot\r\nbe forgotten.... I am above any feelings of revenge, but I don’t wish\r\nto know anything of him, nor of the girl—more depraved in mind than in\r\nheart” (Sipiagin had repeated this phrase at least thirty times since\r\nMariana ran away), “who could bring herself to abandon a home that had\r\nsheltered her, to become the mistress of a nameless adventurer! It is\r\nenough for them that I am content to forget them.”\r\n\r\nAt this last word Sipiagin waved his wrist into space.\r\n\r\n“I forget them, my dear sir!”\r\n\r\n“Your excellency, I have already told you that I did not come from them\r\nin particular, but I may inform your excellency that they are legally\r\nmarried....” (“It’s all the same,” Paklin thought; “I said that I would\r\nlie and so here I am. Never mind!”)\r\n\r\nSipiagin moved his head from left to right on the back of his chair.\r\n\r\n“It does not interest me in the least, sir. It only makes one foolish\r\nmarriage the more in the world—that’s all. But what is this urgent\r\nmatter to which I am indebted for the pleasure of your visit?”\r\n\r\n“Ugh! you cursed director of a department!” Paklin thought, “I’ll soon\r\nmake you pull a different face!” “Your wife’s brother,” he said aloud,\r\n“Mr. Markelov, has been seized by the peasants whom he had been inciting\r\nto rebellion, and is now under arrest in the governor’s house.”\r\n\r\nSipiagin jumped up a second time.\r\n\r\n“What... what did you say?” he blurted out, not at all in his accustomed\r\nministerial baritones, but in an extremely undignified manner.\r\n\r\n“I said that your brother-in-law has been seized and is in chains. As\r\nsoon as I heard of it, I procured horses and came straight away to tell\r\nyou. I thought that I might be rendering a service to you and to the\r\nunfortunate man whom you may be able to save!”\r\n\r\n“I am extremely grateful to you,” Sipiagin said in the same feeble tone\r\nof voice, and violently pressing a bell, shaped like a mushroom, he\r\nfilled the whole house with its clear metallic ring. “I am extremely\r\ngrateful to you,” he repeated more sharply, “but I must tell you that\r\na man who can bring himself to trample under foot all laws, human\r\nand divine, were he a hundred times related to me—is in my eyes not\r\nunfortunate; he is a criminal!”\r\n\r\nA footman came in quickly.\r\n\r\n“Your orders, sir?”\r\n\r\n“The carriage! the carriage and four horses this minute! I am going to\r\ntown. Philip and Stepan are to come with me!” The footman disappeared.\r\n“Yes, sir, my brother-in-law is a criminal! I am going to town not to\r\nsave him! Oh, no!”\r\n\r\n“But, your excellency—”\r\n\r\n“Such are my principles, my dear sir, and I beg you not to annoy me by\r\nyour objections!”\r\n\r\nSipiagin began pacing up and down the room, while Paklin stared with\r\nall his might. “Ugh! you devil!” he thought, “I heard that you were a\r\nliberal, but you’re just like a hungry lion!”\r\n\r\nThe door was flung open and Valentina Mihailovna came into the room with\r\nhurried steps, followed by Kollomietzev.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter, Boris? Why have you ordered the carriage? Are you\r\ngoing to town? What has happened?”\r\n\r\nSipiagin went up to his wife and took her by the arm, between the elbow\r\nand wrist. “_Il faut vous armer de courage, ma chère._ Your brother has\r\nbeen arrested.”\r\n\r\n“My brother? Sergai? What for?”\r\n\r\n“He has been preaching socialism to the peasants.” (Kollomietzev gave\r\na faint little scream.) “Yes! preaching revolutionary ideas, making\r\npropaganda! They seized him—and gave him up. He is now under arrest in\r\nthe town.”\r\n\r\n“Madman! But who told you?”\r\n\r\n“This Mr.... Mr.... what’s his name? Mr. Konopatin brought the news.”\r\n\r\nValentina Mihailovna glanced at Paklin; the latter bowed dejectedly.\r\n(“What a glorious woman!” he thought. Even in such difficult moments...\r\nalas! how susceptible Paklin was to feminine beauty!)\r\n\r\n“And you want to go to town at this hour?”\r\n\r\n“I think the governor will still be up.”\r\n\r\n“I always said it would end like this,” Kollomietzev put in. “It\r\ncouldn’t have been otherwise! But what dears our peasants are really!\r\n_Pardon, madame, c’est votre frère! Mais la vérité avant tout!_”\r\n\r\n“Do you really intend going to town, Boris?” Valentina Mihailovna asked.\r\n\r\n“I feel absolutely certain,” Kollomietzev continued, “that that\r\n_tutor_, Mr. Nejdanov, is mixed up in this. _J’en mettrais ma main au\r\nfeu._ It’s all one gang! Haven’t they seized him? Don’t you know?”\r\n\r\nSipiagin waved his wrist again.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know—and don’t want to know! By the way,” he added, turning to\r\nhis wife, _“il paraît qu’il sont mariés._”\r\n\r\n“Who said so? That same gentleman?” Valentina Mihailovna looked at\r\nPaklin again, this time with half-closed eyes.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“In that case,” Kollomietzev put in, “he must know where they are. Do\r\nyou know where they are? Do you know? Eh? Do you know?”\r\n\r\nKollomietzev took to walking up and down in front of Paklin as if to\r\ncut off his way, although the latter had not betrayed the slightest\r\ninclination of wanting to run away. “Why don’t you speak? Answer me! Do\r\nyou know, eh? Do you know?”\r\n\r\n“Even if I knew,” Paklin began, annoyed; his wrath had risen up in him\r\nat last and his eyes flashed fire: “even if I knew I would not tell\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“Oh... oh...” Kollomietzev muttered. “Do you hear? Do you hear? This one\r\ntoo—this one too is of their gang!”\r\n\r\n“The carriage is ready!” a footman announced loudly. Sipiagin with a\r\nquick graceful movement seized his hat, but Valentina Mihailovna was so\r\ninsistent in her persuasions for him to put off the journey until the\r\nmorning and brought so many convincing arguments to bear—such as: that\r\nit was pitch dark outside, that everybody in town would be asleep, that\r\nhe would only upset his nerves and might catch cold—that Sipiagin at\r\nlength came to agree with her.\r\n\r\n“I obey!” he exclaimed, and with the same graceful gesture, not so rapid\r\nthis time, replaced his hat on the table.\r\n\r\n“I shall not want the carriage now,” he said to the footman, “but see\r\nthat it’s ready at six o’clock in the morning! Do you hear? You can\r\ngo now! But stay! See that the gentleman’s carriage is sent off and the\r\ndriver paid! What? Did you say anything, Mr. Konopatin? I am going\r\nto take you to town with me tomorrow, Mr. Konopatin! What did you say? I\r\ncan’t hear.... Do you take vodka? Give Mr. Konopatin some vodka! No? You\r\ndon’t drink? In that case ... Feodor! take the gentleman into the green\r\nroom! Goodnight, Mr. Kono——”\r\n\r\nPaklin lost all patience.\r\n\r\n“Paklin!” he shouted, “my name is Paklin!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes... it makes no difference. A bit alike, you know. What a\r\npowerful voice you have for your spare build! Till tomorrow, Mr.\r\nPaklin.... Have I got it right this time? _Siméon, vous viendrez avec\r\nnous?_”\r\n\r\n_“Je crois bien!”_\r\n\r\nPaklin was conducted into the green room and locked in. He distinctly\r\nheard the key turned in the English lock as he got into bed. He scolded\r\nhimself severely for his “brilliant idea” and slept very badly.\r\n\r\nHe was awakened early the next morning at half-past five and given\r\ncoffee. As he drank it a footman with striped shoulder-knots stood over\r\nhim with the tray in his hand, shifting from one leg to the other as\r\nthough he were saying, “Hurry up! the gentlemen are waiting!” He\r\nwas taken downstairs. The carriage was already waiting at the door.\r\nKollomietzev’s open carriage was also there. Sipiagin appeared on the\r\nsteps in a cloak made of camel’s hair with a round collar. Such cloaks\r\nhad long ago ceased to be worn except by a certain important dignitary\r\nwhom Sipiagin pandered to and wished to imitate. On important official\r\noccasions he invariably put on this cloak.\r\n\r\nSipiagin greeted Paklin affably, and with an energetic movement of\r\nthe hand pointed to the carriage and asked him to take his seat. “Mr.\r\nPaklin, you are coming with me, Mr. Paklin! Put your bag on the box, Mr.\r\nPaklin! I am taking Mr. Paklin,” he said, emphasising the word “Paklin”\r\n with special stress on the letter _a_. “You have an awful name like that\r\nand get insulted when people change it for you—so here you are then!\r\nTake your fill of it! Mr. Paklin! Paklin!” The unfortunate name rang out\r\nclearly in the cool morning air. It was so keen as to make Kollomietzev,\r\nwho came out after Sipiagin, exclaim several times in French:\r\n“Brrr! brrr! brrr!” He wrapped his cloak more closely about him and\r\nseated himself in his elegant carriage with the hood thrown back. (Had\r\nhis poor friend Michael Obrenovitch, the Servian prince, seen it, he\r\nwould certainly have bought one like it at Binder’s.... _“Vous savez\r\nBinder, le grand carrossier des Champs Elysées?”_)\r\n\r\nValentina Mihailovna, still in her night garments, peeped out from\r\nbehind the half-open shutters of her bedroom. Sipiagin waved his hand to\r\nher from the carriage.\r\n\r\n“Are you quite comfortable, Mr. Paklin? Go on!”\r\n\r\n_“Je vous recommande mon frère, épargnez-le!”_ Valentina Mihailovna said.\r\n\r\n_“Soyez tranquille!”_ Kollomietzev exclaimed, glancing up at her quickly\r\nfrom under the brim of his travelling cap—one of his own special design\r\nwith a cockade in it—_“C’est surtout l’autre, qu’il faut pincer!”_\r\n\r\n“Go on!” Sipiagin exclaimed again. “You are not cold, Mr. Paklin? Go\r\non!”\r\n\r\nThe two carriages rolled away.\r\n\r\nFor about ten minutes neither Sipiagin nor Paklin pronounced a single\r\nword. The unfortunate Sila, in his shabby little coat and crumpled cap,\r\nlooked even more wretched than usual in contrast to the rich background\r\nof dark blue silk with which the carriage was upholstered. He looked\r\naround in silence at the delicate pale blue blinds, which flew up\r\ninstantly at the mere press of a button, at the soft white sheep-skin\r\nrug at their feet, at the mahogany box in front with a movable desk for\r\nletters and even a shelf for books. (Boris Andraevitch never worked in\r\nhis carriage, but he liked people to think that he did, after the manner\r\nof Thiers, who always worked when travelling.) Paklin felt shy. Sipiagin\r\nglanced at him once or twice over his clean-shaven cheek, and with a\r\npompous deliberation pulled out of a side-pocket a silver cigar-case\r\nwith a curly monogram and a Slavonic band and offered him... really\r\noffered him a cigar, holding it gently between the second and third\r\nfingers of a hand neatly clad in an English glove of yellow dogskin.\r\n\r\n“I don’t smoke,” Paklin muttered.\r\n\r\n“Really!” Sipiagin exclaimed and lighted the cigar himself, an excellent\r\nregalia.\r\n\r\n“I must tell you... my dear Mr. Paklin,” he began, puffing gracefully\r\nat his cigar and sending out delicate rings of delicious smoke, “that I\r\nam... really... very grateful to you. I might have... seemed... a\r\nlittle severe... last night... which does not really... do justice to\r\nmy character... believe me.” (Sipiagin purposely hesitated over his\r\nspeech.) “But just put yourself in my place, Mr. Paklin!” (Sipiagin\r\nrolled the cigar from one corner of his mouth to the other.) “The\r\nposition I occupy places me... so to speak... before the public eye,\r\nand suddenly, without any warning... my wife’s brother... compromises\r\nhimself... and me, in this impossible way! Well, Mr. Paklin? But perhaps\r\nyou think that it’s nothing?”\r\n\r\n“I am far from thinking that, your excellency.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t happen to know exactly why... and where he was arrested?”\r\n\r\n“I heard that he was arrested in T. district.”\r\n\r\n“Who told you so?”\r\n\r\n“A certain person.”\r\n\r\n“Of course it could hardly have been a bird. But who was this person?”\r\n\r\n“An assistant... of the director of the governor’s office—”\r\n\r\n“What’s his name?”\r\n\r\n“The director’s?”\r\n\r\n“No, the assistant’s.”\r\n\r\n“His name is... Ulyashevitch. He is a very honest man, your excellency.\r\nAs soon as I heard of the affair, I hastened to tell you.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes. I am very grateful to you indeed. But what utter madness!\r\ndownright madness! Don’t you think so, Mr. Paklin?”\r\n\r\n“Utter madness!” Paklin exclaimed, while the perspiration rolled down\r\nhis back in a hot stream, “it just shows,” he continued, “the folly of\r\nnot understanding the peasant. Mr. Markelov, so far as I know him, has\r\na very kind and generous heart, but he has no conception of what the\r\nRussian peasant is really like.” (Paklin glanced at Sipiagin who sat\r\nslightly turned towards him, gazing at him with a cold, though not\r\nunfriendly, light in his eyes.) “The Russian peasant can never be\r\ninduced to revolt except by taking advantage of that devotion of his\r\nto some high authority, some tsar. Some sort of legend must be\r\ninvented—you remember Dmitrius the pretender—some sort of royal sign\r\nmust be shown him, branded on the breast.”\r\n\r\n“Just like Pugatchev,” Sipiagin interrupted him in a tone of voice which\r\nseemed to imply that he had not yet forgotten his history and that\r\nit was really not necessary for Paklin to go on. “What madness! what\r\nmadness!” he added, and became wrapped in the contemplation of the rings\r\nof smoke as they rose quickly one after another from the end of his\r\ncigar.\r\n\r\n“Your excellency,” Paklin began apologetically, “I have just said that I\r\ndidn’t smoke... but it was not true. I do smoke and your cigar smells so\r\nnice—”\r\n\r\n“Eh? What?” Sipiagin asked as if waking up; and without giving Paklin\r\ntime to repeat his request, he proved in the most unmistakable manner\r\nthat he had heard every word, and had merely asked his questions for the\r\nsake of dignity, by offering him his cigar-case.\r\n\r\nPaklin took a cigar gratefully and lighted it with care.\r\n\r\n“Here’s a good opportunity,” he thought, but Sipiagin had anticipated\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“I remember your saying...” he began carelessly, stopping to look at his\r\ncigar and pulling his hat lower over his forehead, “you spoke... of...\r\nof that friend of yours, who married my ... niece. Do you ever see them?\r\nThey’ve settled not far from here, eh?”\r\n\r\n(“Take care! be on your guard, Sila!” Paklin thought.)\r\n\r\n“I have only seen them once, your excellency. They are living.. .\r\ncertainly... not very far from here.”\r\n\r\n“You quite understand, I hope,” Sipiagin continued in the same tone,\r\n“that I can take no further serious interest—as I explained to\r\nyou—either in that frivolous girl or in your friend. Heaven knows that\r\nI have no prejudices, but really, you will agree with me, this is too\r\nmuch! So foolish, you know. However, I suppose they were more drawn\r\ntogether by politics.. .” (“politics!” he repeated, shrugging his\r\nshoulders) “than by any other feeling!”\r\n\r\n“I think so too, your excellency!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Mr. Nejdanov was certainly revolutionary. To do him justice he\r\nmade no secret of his opinions.”\r\n\r\n“Nejdanov,” Paklin ventured, “may have been carried away, but his\r\nheart—”\r\n\r\n“Is good,” Sipiagin put in; “I know, like Markelov’s. They all have good\r\nhearts. He has no doubt also been mixed up in this affair... and will be\r\nimplicated.... I suppose I shall have to intercede for him too!”\r\n\r\nPaklin clasped his hands to his breast.\r\n\r\n“Oh, your excellency! Extend your protection to him! He fully...\r\ndeserves... your sympathy.”\r\n\r\nSipiagin snorted.\r\n\r\n“You think so?”\r\n\r\n“At any rate if not for him... for your niece’s sake; for his wife!”\r\n (“Heavens! What lies I’m telling,” Paklin thought.)\r\n\r\nSipiagin half-closed his eyes.\r\n\r\n“I see that you’re a very devoted friend. That’s a very good quality,\r\nvery praiseworthy, young man. And so you said they lived in this\r\nneighbourhood?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, your excellency; in a large establishment—” Here Paklin bit his\r\ntongue.\r\n\r\n“Why, of course, at Solomin’s! that’s where they are! However, I knew it\r\nall along. I’ve been told so; I’ve already been informed.” (Mr.\r\nSipiagin did not know this in the least, and no one had told him, but\r\nrecollecting Solomin’s visit and their midnight interview, he promptly\r\nthrew out this bait, which caught Paklin at once.)\r\n\r\n“Since you know that,” he began and bit his tongue a second time.... But\r\nit was already too late. A single glance at Sipiagin made him realise\r\nthat he had been playing with him as a cat plays with a mouse.\r\n\r\n“I must say, your excellency,” the unfortunate Paklin stammered out; “I\r\nmust say, that I really know nothing—”\r\n\r\n“But I ask you no questions! Really! What do you take me and yourself\r\nfor?” Sipiagin asked haughtily, and promptly withdrew into his\r\nministerial heights.\r\n\r\nAnd Paklin again felt himself a mean little ensnared creature. Until\r\nthat moment he had kept the cigar in the corner of his mouth away from\r\nSipiagin and puffed at it quietly, blowing the smoke to one side; now he\r\ntook it out of his mouth and ceased smoking altogether.\r\n\r\n“My God!” he groaned inwardly, while the perspiration streamed down his\r\nback more and more, “what have I done? I have betrayed everything and\r\neverybody.... I have been duped, been bought over by a good cigar!! I am\r\na traitor! What shall I do now to help matters? Oh God!”\r\n\r\nBut there was nothing to be done. Sipiagin dozed off in a haughty,\r\ndignified, ministerial manner, enveloped in his stately cloak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXV\r\n\r\nThe governor of S. was one of those good-natured, happy-go-lucky,\r\nworldly generals who, endowed with wonderfully clean, snow-white bodies\r\nand souls to match, of good breeding and education, are turned out of a\r\nmill where they are never ground down to becoming the “shepherds of\r\nthe people.” Nevertheless they prove themselves capable of a tolerable\r\namount of administrative ability—do little work, but are forever\r\nsighing after St. Petersburg and paying court to all the pretty women of\r\nthe place. These are men who in some unaccountable way become useful to\r\ntheir province and manage to leave pleasant memories behind them. The\r\ngovernor had only just got out of bed, and was comfortably seated before\r\nhis dressing-table in his night-shirt and silk dressing-gown, bathing\r\nhis face and neck with eau-de-cologne after having removed a whole\r\ncollection of charms and coins dangling from it, when he was informed of\r\nthe arrival of Sipiagin and Kollomietzev upon some urgent business. He\r\nwas very familiar with Sipiagin, having known him from childhood and\r\nconstantly run across him in St. Petersburg drawing-rooms, and lately he\r\nhad begun to ejaculate a respectful “Ah!” every time his name occurred\r\nto him—as if he saw in him a future statesman. Kollomietzev he did not\r\nknow so well and respected less in consequence of various unpleasant\r\ncomplaints that had been made against him; however, he looked upon him\r\nas a man _qui fera chemin_ in any case.\r\n\r\nHe ordered his guests to be shown into his study, where he soon joined\r\nthem, as he was, in his silk dressing-gown, and not so much as excusing\r\nhimself for receiving them in such an unofficial costume, shook hands\r\nwith them heartily. Only Sipiagin and Kollomietzev appeared in the\r\ngovernor’s study; Paklin remained in the drawing-room. On getting out\r\nof the carriage he had tried to slip away, muttering that he had some\r\nbusiness at home, but Sipiagin had detained him with a polite firmness\r\n(Kollomietzev had rushed up to him and whispered in his ear: _“Ne le\r\nlâcher pas! Tonnerre de tonnerres!”_) and taken him in. He had not,\r\nhowever, taken him to the study, but had asked him, with the same polite\r\nfirmness, to wait in the drawing-room until he was wanted. Even here\r\nPaklin had hoped to escape, but a robust gendarme at Kollomietzev’s\r\ninstruction appeared in the doorway; so Paklin remained.\r\n\r\n“I dare say you’ve guessed what has brought me to you, _Voldemar_,”\r\n Sipiagin began.\r\n\r\n“No, my dear, no, I can’t,” the amiable Epicurean replied, while a smile\r\nof welcome played about his rosy cheeks, showing a glimpse of shiny\r\nteeth, half hidden by his silky moustache.\r\n\r\n“What? Don’t you know about Markelov?”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean? What Markelov?” the governor repeated with the same\r\njoyful expression on his face. He did not remember, in the first place,\r\nthat the man who was arrested yesterday was called Markelov, and, in\r\nthe second, he had quite forgotten that Sipiagin’s wife had a brother\r\nof that name. “But why are you standing, Boris? Sit down. Would you like\r\nsome tea?”\r\n\r\nSipiagin’s mind was far from tea.\r\n\r\nWhen at last he explained why they had both appeared, the governor\r\nuttered an exclamation of pain and struck himself on the forehead, while\r\nhis face assumed a sympathetic expression.\r\n\r\n“Dear me! what a misfortune! And he’s here now—today.... You know we\r\nnever keep _that sort_ with us for more than one night at the outside,\r\nbut the chief of police is out of town, so your brother-in-law has been\r\ndetained. He is to be sent on tomorrow. Dear me! what a dreadful thing!\r\nWhat your wife must have gone through! What would you like me to do?”\r\n\r\n“I would like to have an interview with him here, if it is not against\r\nthe law.”\r\n\r\n“My dear boy! laws are not made for men like you. I do feel so sorry for\r\nyou.... _C’est affreux, tu sais!_”\r\n\r\nHe gave a peculiar ring. An adjutant appeared.\r\n\r\n“My dear baron, do please make some arrangement there....” He told him\r\nwhat he wanted and the baron vanished. “Only think, _mon cher ami_, the\r\npeasants nearly killed him. They tied his hands behind him, flung him\r\nin a cart, and brought him here! And he’s not in the least bit angry\r\nor indignant with them you know! He was so calm altogether that I was\r\namazed! But you will see for yourself. _C’est un fanatique tranquille._”\r\n\r\n_“Ce sont les pires,”_ Kollomietzev remarked sarcastically. The governor\r\nlooked up at him from under his eyebrows. “By the way, I must have a\r\nword with you, Simion Petrovitch.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; what about?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t like things at all—”\r\n\r\n“What things?”\r\n\r\n“You know that peasant who owed you money and came here to complain—”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“He’s hanged himself.”\r\n\r\n“When?”\r\n\r\n“It’s of no consequence when; but it’s an ugly affair.”\r\n\r\nKollomietzev merely shrugged his shoulders and moved away to the window\r\nwith a graceful swing of the body. At this moment the adjutant brought\r\nin Markelov.\r\n\r\nThe governor had been right; he was unnaturally calm. Even his habitual\r\nmoroseness had given place to an expression of weary indifference, which\r\ndid not change when he caught sight of his brother-in-law. Only in the\r\nglance which he threw on the German adjutant, who was escorting him,\r\nthere was a momentary flash of the old hatred he felt towards such\r\npeople. His coat had been torn in several places and hurriedly stitched\r\nup with coarse thread; his forehead, eyebrows, and the bridge of his\r\nnose were covered with small scars caked with clotted blood. He had not\r\nwashed, but had combed his hair.\r\n\r\n“Sergai Mihailovitch!” Sipiagin began excitedly, taking a step or two\r\ntowards him and extending his right hand, only so that he might touch\r\nhim or stop him if he made a movement in advance, “Sergai Mihailovitch!\r\nI am not here to tell you of our amazement, our deep distress—you can\r\nhave no doubt of that! You _wanted_ to ruin yourself and have done\r\nso! But I’ve come to tell you ... that ... that ... to give you the\r\nchance of hearing sound common-sense through the voice of honour and\r\nfriendship. You can still mitigate your lot and, believe me, I will\r\ndo all in my power to help you, as the honoured head of this province\r\ncan bear witness!” At this point Sipiagin raised his voice. “A real\r\npenitence of your wrongs and a full confession without reserve which\r\nwill be duly presented in the proper quarters——”\r\n\r\n“Your excellency,” Markelov exclaimed suddenly, turning towards the\r\ngovernor—the very sound of his voice was calm, though it was a little\r\nhoarse; “I thought that you wanted to see me in order to cross-examine\r\nme again, but if I have been brought here solely by Mr. Sipiagin’s wish,\r\nthen please order me to be taken back again. We cannot understand one\r\nanother. All he says is so much Greek to me.”\r\n\r\n“Greek, eh!” Kollomietzev shrieked. “And to set peasants rioting, is\r\nthat Greek too? Is that Greek too, eh?”\r\n\r\n“What have you here, your excellency? A landowner of the secret police?\r\nAnd how zealous he is!” Markelov remarked, a faint smile of pleasure\r\nplaying about his pale lips.\r\n\r\nKollomietzev stamped and raged, but the governor stopped him.\r\n\r\n“It serves you right, Simion Petrovitch. You shouldn’t interfere in what\r\nis not your business.”\r\n\r\n“Not my business ... not my business.... It seems to me that it’s the\r\nbusiness of every nobleman——”\r\n\r\nMarkelov scanned Kollomietzev coldly and slowly, as if for the last time\r\nand then turned to Sipiagin.\r\n\r\n“If you really want to know my views, my dear brother-in-law, here they\r\nare. I admit that the peasants had a right to arrest me and give me up\r\nif they disapproved of what I preached to them. They were free to\r\ndo what they wanted. I came to them, not they to me. As for the\r\ngovernment—if it does send me to Siberia, I’ll go without grumbling,\r\nalthough I don’t consider myself guilty. The government does its work,\r\ndefends itself. Are you satisfied?”\r\n\r\nSipiagin wrung his hands in despair.\r\n\r\n“Satisfied!! What a word! That’s not the point, and it is not for us\r\nto judge the doings of the government. The question, my dear Sergai,\r\nis whether you feel” (Sipiagin had decided to touch the tender strings)\r\n“the utter unreasonableness, senselessness, of your undertaking and are\r\nprepared to repent; and whether I can answer for you at all, my dear\r\nSergai.”\r\n\r\nMarkelov frowned.\r\n\r\n“I have said all I have to say and don’t want to repeat it.”\r\n\r\n“But don’t you repent? Don’t you repent?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, leave me alone with your repentance! You want to steal into my very\r\nsoul? Leave that, at any rate, to me.”\r\n\r\nSipiagin shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n“You were always like that; never would listen to common-sense. You have\r\na splendid chance of getting out of this quietly, honourably——”\r\n\r\n“Quietly, honourably,” Markelov repeated savagely. “We know those words.\r\nThey are always flung at a man when he’s wanted to do something mean!\r\nThat is what these fine phrases are for!”\r\n\r\n“We sympathise with you,” Sipiagin continued reproachfully, “and you\r\nhate us.”\r\n\r\n“Fine sympathy! To Siberia and hard labour with us; that is your\r\nsympathy. Oh, let me alone! let me alone! for Heaven’s sake!”\r\n\r\nMarkelov lowered his head.\r\n\r\nHe was agitated at heart, though externally calm. He was most of all\r\ntortured by the fact that he had been betrayed—and by whom? By Eremy of\r\nGoloplok! That same Eremy whom he had trusted so much! That Mendely the\r\nsulky had not followed him, had really not surprised him. Mendely was\r\ndrunk and was consequently afraid. But Eremy! For Markelov, Eremy stood\r\nin some way as the personification of the whole Russian people, and\r\nEremy had deceived him! Had he been mistaken about the thing he was\r\nstriving for? Was Kisliakov a liar? And were Vassily Nikolaevitch’s\r\norders all stupid? And all the articles, books, works of socialists and\r\nthinkers, every letter of which had seemed to him invincible truth, were\r\nthey all nonsense too? Was it really so? And the beautiful simile of\r\nthe abscess awaiting the prick of the lancet—was that, too, nothing more\r\nthan a phrase? “No! no!” he whispered to himself, and the colour spread\r\nfaintly over his bronze-coloured face; “no! All these things are true,\r\ntrue... only I am to blame. I did not know how to do things, did not\r\nput things in the right way! I ought simply to have given orders, and\r\nif anyone had tried to hinder, or object—put a bullet through his head!\r\nthere is nothing else to be done! He who is against us has no right to\r\nlive. Don’t they kill spies like dogs, worse than dogs?”\r\n\r\nAll the details of his capture rose up in Markelov’s mind. First the\r\nsilence, the leers, then the shrieks from the back of the crowd...\r\nsomeone coming up sideways as if bowing to him, then that sudden\r\nrush, when he was knocked down. His own cries of “What are you doing,\r\nmy boys?” and their shouts, “A belt! A belt! tie him up!” Then the\r\nrattling of his bones ... unspeakable rage ... filth in his mouth, his\r\nnostrils.... “Shove him in the cart! shove him in the cart!” someone\r\nroared with laughter....\r\n\r\n“I didn’t go about it in the right way....” That was the thing that\r\nmost tormented him. That he had fallen under the wheel was his personal\r\nmisfortune and had nothing to do with the cause—it was possible to bear\r\nthat ... but Eremy! Eremy!!\r\n\r\nWhile Markelov was standing with his head sunk on his breast, Sipiagin\r\ndrew the governor aside and began talking to him in undertones. He\r\nflourished two fingers across his forehead, as though he would suggest\r\nthat the unfortunate man was not quite right in his head, in order to\r\narouse if not sympathy, at any rate indulgence towards the madman. The\r\ngovernor shrugged his shoulders, opened and shut his eyes, regretted\r\nhis inability to do anything, but made some sort of promise in the\r\nend. _“Tous les égards ... certainement, tous les égards,”_ the soft,\r\npleasant words flowed through his scented moustache. “But you know the\r\nlaw, my boy!”\r\n\r\n“Of course I do!” Sipiagin responded with a sort of submissive severity.\r\n\r\nWhile they were talking in the corner, Kollomietzev could scarcely stand\r\nstill in one spot. He walked up and down, hummed and hawed, showed every\r\nsign of impatience. At last he went up to Sipiagin, saying hastily,\r\n_“Vous oublier l’autre!”_\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes!” Sipiagin exclaimed loudly. “_Merci de me l’avoir rappelé._\r\nYour excellency,” he said, turning to the governor (he purposely\r\naddressed his friend Voldemar in this formal way, so as not to\r\ncompromise the prestige of authority in Markelov’s presence), “I must\r\ndraw your attention to the fact that my brother-in-law’s mad attempt\r\nhas certain ramifications, and one of these branches, that is to say,\r\none of the suspected persons, is to be found not very far from here, in\r\nthis town. I’ve brought another with me,” he added in a whisper, “he’s\r\nin the drawing-room. Have him brought in here.”\r\n\r\n“What a man!” the governor thought with admiration, gazing respectfully\r\nat Sipiagin. He gave the order and a minute later Sila Paklin stood\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\nPaklin bowed very low to the governor as he came in, but catching sight\r\nof Markelov before he had time to raise himself, remained as he\r\nwas, half bent down, fidgetting with his cap. Markelov looked at him\r\nvacantly, but could hardly have recognised him, as he withdrew into his\r\nown thoughts.\r\n\r\n“Is this the branch?” the governor asked, pointing to Paklin with a long\r\nwhite finger adorned with a turquoise ring.\r\n\r\n“Oh, no!” Sipiagin exclaimed with a slight smile. “However, who knows!”\r\n he added after a moment’s thought. “Your excellency,” he said aloud,\r\n“the gentleman before you is Mr. Paklin. He comes from St. Petersburg\r\nand is a close friend of a certain person who for a time held the\r\nposition of tutor in my house and who ran away, taking with him a\r\ncertain young girl who, I blush to say, is my niece.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! _oui, oui,_” the governor mumbled, shaking his head, “I heard the\r\nstory.... The princess told me——”\r\n\r\nSipiagin raised his voice.\r\n\r\n“That person is a certain Mr. Nejdanov, whom I strongly suspect of\r\ndangerous ideas and theories—”\r\n\r\n_“Un rouge à tous crins,”_ Kollomietzev put in.\r\n\r\n“Yes, dangerous ideas and theories,” Sipiagin repeated more\r\nemphatically. “He must certainly know something about this propaganda.\r\nHe is... in hiding, as I have been informed by Mr. Paklin, in the\r\nmerchant Falyaeva’s factory—”\r\n\r\nAt these words Markelov threw another glance at Paklin and gave a slow,\r\nindifferent smile.\r\n\r\n“Excuse me, excuse me, your excellency,” Paklin cried, “and you, Mr.\r\nSipiagin, I never... never—”\r\n\r\n“Did you say the merchant Falyaeva?” the governor asked, turning to\r\nSipiagin and merely shaking his fingers in Paklin’s direction, as much\r\nas to say, “Gently, my good man, gently.” “What is coming over our\r\nrespectable, bearded merchants? Only yesterday one was arrested in\r\nconnection with this affair. You may have heard of him—Golushkin, a\r\nvery rich man. But he’s harmless enough. He won’t make revolutions; he’s\r\ngrovelling on his knees already.”\r\n\r\n“The merchant Falyaeva has nothing whatever to do with it,” Sipiagin\r\nbegan; “I know nothing of his ideas; I was only talking of his factory\r\nwhere Mr. Nejdanov is to be found at this very moment, as Mr. Paklin\r\nsays—”\r\n\r\n“I said nothing of the kind!” Paklin cried; “you said it yourself!”\r\n\r\n“Excuse me, Mr. Paklin,” Sipiagin pronounced with the same relentless\r\nprecision, “I admire that feeling of friendship which prompts you to\r\ndeny it.” (“A regular Guizot, upon my word!” the governor thought to\r\nhimself.) “But take example by me. Do you suppose that the feeling of\r\nkinship is less strong in me than your feeling of friendship? But there\r\nis another feeling, my dear sir, yet stronger still, which guides all\r\nour deeds and actions, and that is duty!”\r\n\r\n_“Le sentiment du devoir,”_ Kollomietzev explained.\r\n\r\nMarkelov took both the speakers in at a glance.\r\n\r\n“Your excellency!” he exclaimed, “I ask you a second time; please have\r\nme removed out of sight of these babblers.”\r\n\r\nBut there the governor lost patience a little.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Markelov!” he pronounced severely, “I would advise you, in your\r\npresent position, to be a little more careful of your tongue, and to\r\nshow a little more respect to your elders, especially when they give\r\nexpression to such patriotic sentiments as those you have just heard\r\nfrom the lips of your _beau-frère!_ I shall be delighted, my dear\r\nBoris,” he added, turning to Sipiagin, “to tell the minister of your\r\nnoble action. But with whom is this Nejdanov staying at the factory?”\r\n\r\nSipiagin frowned.\r\n\r\n“With a certain Mr. Solomin, the chief engineer there, Mr. Paklin says.”\r\n\r\nIt seemed to afford Sipiagin some peculiar pleasure in tormenting poor\r\nSila. He made him pay dearly for the cigar he had given him and the\r\nplayful familiarity of his behaviour.\r\n\r\n“This Solomin,” Kollomietzev put in, “is an out-and-out radical and\r\nrepublican. It would be a good thing if your excellency were to turn\r\nyour attention to him too.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know these gentlemen... Solomin, and what’s his name. ..\r\nNejdanov?” the governor asked Markelov, somewhat authoritatively.\r\n\r\nMarkelov distended his nostrils malignantly.\r\n\r\n“Do you know Confucius and Titus Livius, your excellency?”\r\n\r\nThe governor turned away.\r\n\r\n_“Il n’y a pas moyen de causer avec cette homme,”_ he said, shrugging\r\nhis shoulders. “Baron, come here, please.”\r\n\r\nThe adjutant went up to him quickly and Paklin seized the opportunity of\r\nlimping over to Sipiagin.\r\n\r\n“What are you doing?” he asked in a whisper. “Why do you want to ruin\r\nyour niece? Why, she’s with him, with Nejdanov!”\r\n\r\n“I am not ruining any one, my dear sir,” Sipiagin said loudly, “I am\r\nonly doing what my conscience bids me do, and—”\r\n\r\n“And what your wife, my sister, bids you do; you dare not stand up\r\nagainst her!” Markelov exclaimed just as loudly.\r\n\r\nSipiagin took no notice of the remark; it was too much beneath him!\r\n\r\n“Listen,” Paklin continued, trembling all over with agitation, or may\r\nbe from timidity; there was a malignant light in his eyes and the tears\r\nwere nearly choking him—tears of pity for _them_ and rage at himself;\r\n“listen, I told you she was married—it wasn’t true, I lied! but they\r\nmust get married—and if you prevent it, if the police get there—there\r\nwill be a stain on your conscience which you’ll never be able to wipe\r\nout—and you—”\r\n\r\n“If what you have just told me be true,” Sipiagin interrupted him\r\nstill more loudly, “then it can only hasten the measures which I\r\nthink necessary to take in this matter; and as for the purity of my\r\nconscience, I beg you not to trouble about that, my dear sir.”\r\n\r\n“It’s been polished,” Markelov put in again; “there is a coat of St.\r\nPetersburg varnish upon it; no amount of washing will make it come\r\nclean. You may whisper as much as you like, Mr. Paklin, but you won’t\r\nget anything out of it!”\r\n\r\nAt this point the governor considered it necessary to interfere.\r\n\r\n“I think that you have said enough, gentlemen,” he began, “and I’ll ask\r\nyou, my dear baron, to take Mr. Markelov away. _N’est ce pas,_ Boris,\r\nyou don’t want him any further—”\r\n\r\nSipiagin made a gesture with his hands.\r\n\r\n“I said everything I could think of!”\r\n\r\n“Very well, baron!”\r\n\r\nThe adjutant came up to Markelov, clinked his spurs, made a horizontal\r\nmovement of the hand, as if to request Markelov to make a move; the\r\nlatter turned and walked out. Paklin, only in imagination it is true,\r\nbut with bitter sympathy and pity, shook him by the hand.\r\n\r\n“We’ll send some of our men to the factory,” the governor continued;\r\n“but you know, Boris, I thought this gentleman” (he moved his chin in\r\nPaklin’s direction) “told you something about your niece... I understood\r\nthat she was there at the factory. Then how——”\r\n\r\n“It’s impossible to arrest her in any case,” Sipiagin remarked\r\nthoughtfully; “perhaps she will think better of it and return. I’ll\r\nwrite her a note, if I may.”\r\n\r\n“Do please. You may be quite sure ... _nous Coffrerons le quidam ...\r\nmais nous sommes galants avec les dames et avec celle-là donc!_”\r\n\r\n“But you’ve made no arrangements about this Solomin,” Kollomietzev\r\nexclaimed plaintively. He had been on the alert all the while, trying to\r\ncatch what the governor and Sipiagin were saying. “I assure you he’s the\r\nprincipal ringleader! I have a wonderful instinct about these things!”\r\n\r\n“_Pas trop de zèle_, my dear Simion Petrovitch,” the governor remarked\r\nwith a smile. “You remember Talleyrand! If it is really as you say the\r\nfellow won’t escape us. You had better think of your—” the governor put\r\nhis hand to his throat significantly. “By the way,” he said, turning to\r\nSipiagin, “_et ce gaillard-là”_ (he moved his chin in Paklin’s direction).\r\n_“Qu’en ferons nous?_ He does not appear very dangerous.”\r\n\r\n“Let him go,” Sipiagin said in an undertone, and added in German,\r\n_“Lass’ den Lumpen laufen!”_\r\n\r\nHe imagined for some reason that he was quoting from Goethe’s _Götz von\r\nBerlichingen_.\r\n\r\n“You can go, sir!” the governor said aloud. “We do not require you any\r\nlonger. Good day.”\r\n\r\nPaklin bowed to the company in general and went out into the street\r\ncompletely crushed and humiliated. Heavens! this contempt had utterly\r\nbroken him.\r\n\r\n“Good God! What am I? A coward, a traitor?” he thought, in unutterable\r\ndespair. “Oh, no, no! I am an honest man, gentlemen! I have still some\r\nmanhood left!”\r\n\r\nBut who was this familiar figure sitting on the governor’s step and\r\nlooking at him with a dejected, reproachful glance? It was Markelov’s\r\nold servant. He had evidently come to town for his master, and would\r\nnot for a moment leave the door of his prison. But why did he look so\r\nreproachfully at Paklin? He had not betrayed Markelov!\r\n\r\n“And why did I go poking my nose into things that did not concern me?\r\nWhy could I not sit quietly at home? And now it will be said and written\r\nthat Paklin betrayed them—betrayed his friends to the enemy!” He\r\nrecalled the look Markelov had given him and his last words, “Whisper as\r\nmuch as you like, Mr. Paklin, but you won’t get anything out of it!” and\r\nthen these sad, aged, dejected eyes! he thought in desperation. And as\r\nit says in the scriptures, he “wept bitterly” as he turned his steps\r\ntowards the oasis, to Fomishka and Fimishka and Snandulia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVI\r\n\r\nWhen Mariana came out of her room that morning she noticed Nejdanov\r\nsitting on the couch fully dressed. His head was resting against one\r\narm, while the other lay weak and helpless on his knee. She went up to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“Good morning, Alexai. Why, you haven’t undressed? Haven’t you slept? How\r\npale you are!”\r\n\r\nHis heavy eyelids rose slowly.\r\n\r\n“No, I haven’t.”\r\n\r\n“Aren’t you well, or is it the after-effects of yesterday?”\r\n\r\nNejdanov shook his head.\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t sleep after Solomin went into your room.”\r\n\r\n“When?”\r\n\r\n“Last night.”\r\n\r\n“Alexai! are you jealous? A new idea! What a time to be jealous in! Why,\r\nhe was only with me a quarter of an hour. We talked about his cousin,\r\nthe priest, and discussed arrangements for our marriage.”\r\n\r\n“I know that he was only with you a short time. I saw him come out. And\r\nI’m not jealous, oh no! But still I couldn’t fall asleep after that.”\r\n\r\n“But why?”\r\n\r\nNejdanov was silent.\r\n\r\n“I kept thinking... thinking... thinking!”\r\n\r\n“Of what?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, of you... of him... and of myself.”\r\n\r\n“And what came of all your thinking?”\r\n\r\n“Shall I tell you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, tell me.”\r\n\r\n“It seemed to me that I stood in your way—in his... and in my own.”\r\n\r\n“Mine? His? It’s easy to see what you mean by that, though you declare\r\nyou’re not jealous, but your own?”\r\n\r\n“Mariana, there are two men in me and one doesn’t let the other live. So\r\nI thought it might be better if both ceased to live.”\r\n\r\n“Please don’t, Alexai. Why do you want to torment yourself and me? We\r\nought to be considering ways and means of getting away. They won’t leave\r\nus in peace you know.”\r\n\r\nNejdanov took her hand caressingly.\r\n\r\n“Sit down beside me, Mariana, and let us talk things over like comrades\r\nwhile there is still time. Give me your hand. It would be a good thing\r\nfor us to have an explanation, though they say that all explanations\r\nonly lead to further muddle. But you are kind and intelligent and are\r\nsure to understand, even the things that I am unable to express. Come,\r\nsit down.”\r\n\r\nNejdanov’s voice was soft, and a peculiarly affectionate tenderness\r\nshone in his eyes as he looked entreatingly at Mariana.\r\n\r\nShe sat down beside him readily and took his hand.\r\n\r\n“Thanks, dearest. I won’t keep you long. I thought out all the things\r\nI wanted to say to you last night. Don’t think I was too much upset by\r\nyesterday’s occurrence. I was no doubt extremely ridiculous and rather\r\ndisgusting, but I know you didn’t think anything bad of me—you know me.\r\nI am not telling the truth exactly when I say that I wasn’t upset—I was\r\nhorribly upset, not because I was brought home drunk, but because I was\r\nconvinced of my utter inefficiency. Not because I could not drink like\r\na real Russian—but in everything! everything! Mariana, I must tell you\r\nthat I no longer believe in the cause that united us and on the strength\r\nof which we ran away together. To tell the truth, I had already lost\r\nfaith when your enthusiasm set me on fire again. I don’t believe in it!\r\nI can’t believe in it!”\r\n\r\nHe put his disengaged hand over his eyes and ceased for awhile. Mariana\r\ndid not utter a single word and sat looking downwards. She felt that he\r\nhad told her nothing new.\r\n\r\n“I always thought,” Nejdanov continued, taking his hand away from\r\nhis eyes, but not looking at Mariana again, “that I believed in the\r\ncause itself, but had no faith in myself, in my own strength, my own\r\ncapacities. I used to think that my abilities did not come up to my\r\nconvictions.... But you can’t separate these things. And what’s the use\r\nof deceiving oneself? No—I don’t believe in the _cause itself_. And\r\nyou, Mariana, do you believe in it?”\r\n\r\nMariana sat up straight and raised her head.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I do, Alexai. I believe in it with all the strength of my soul,\r\nand will devote my whole life to it, to the last breath!”\r\n\r\nNejdanov turned towards her and looked at her enviously, with a tender\r\nlight in his eyes.\r\n\r\n“I knew you would answer like that. So you see there is nothing for us\r\nto do together; you have severed our tie with one blow.”\r\n\r\nMariana was silent.\r\n\r\n“Take Solomin, for instance,” Nejdanov began again, “though he does not\r\nbelieve—”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“It’s quite true. He does not believe... but that is not necessary for\r\nhim; he is moving steadily onwards. A man walking along a road in a town\r\ndoes not question the existence of the town—he just goes his way. That\r\nis Solomin. That is all that’s needed. But I... I can’t go ahead, don’t\r\nwant to turn back, and am sick of staying where I am. How dare I ask\r\nanyone to be my companion? You know the old proverb, ‘With two people\r\nto carry the pole, the burden will be easier.’ But if you let go your\r\nend—what becomes of the other?”\r\n\r\n“Alexai,” Mariana began irresolutely, “I think you exaggerate. Do we not\r\nlove each other?”\r\n\r\nNejdanov gave a deep sigh.\r\n\r\n“Mariana... I bow down before you... you pity me, and each of us has\r\nimplicit faith in the other’s honesty—that is our position. But there\r\nis no love between us.”\r\n\r\n“Stop, Alexai! what are you saying? The police may come for us today...\r\nwe must go away together and not part—”\r\n\r\n“And get Father Zosim to marry us at Solomin’s suggestion. I know that\r\nyou merely look upon our marriage as a kind of passport—a means of\r\navoiding any difficulties with the police... but still it will bind us\r\nto some extent; necessitate our living together and all that. Besides it\r\nalways presupposes a desire to live together.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean, Alexai? You don’t intend staying here?”\r\n\r\n“N-n-no,” Nejdanov said hesitatingly. The word “yes” nearly escaped his\r\nlips, but he recollected himself in time.\r\n\r\n“Then you are going to a different place—not where I am going?”\r\n\r\nNejdanov pressed her hand which still lay in his own.\r\n\r\n“It would indeed be vile to leave you without a supporter, without a\r\nprotector, but I won’t do that, as bad as I may be. You shall have a\r\nprotector—rest assured.”\r\n\r\nMariana bent down towards him and, putting her face close against his,\r\nlooked anxiously into his eyes, as though trying to penetrate to his\r\nvery soul.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter, Alexai? What have you on your mind? Tell me ...\r\nyou frighten me. Your words are so strange and enigmatical.... And your\r\nface! I have never seen your face like that!”\r\n\r\nNejdanov put her from him gently and kissed her hand tenderly. This time\r\nshe made no resistance and did not laugh, but sat still looking at him\r\nanxiously.\r\n\r\n“Don’t be alarmed, dear. There is nothing strange in it. They say\r\nMarkelov was beaten by the peasants; he felt their blows—they crushed\r\nhis ribs. They did not beat me, they even drank with me—drank\r\nmy health—but they crushed my soul more completely than they did\r\nMarkelov’s ribs. I was born out of joint, wanted to set myself right,\r\nand have made matters worse. That is what you notice in my face.”\r\n\r\n“Alexai,” Mariana said slowly, “it would be very wrong of you not to be\r\nfrank with me.”\r\n\r\nHe clenched his hands.\r\n\r\n“Mariana, my whole being is laid bare before you, and whatever I might\r\ndo, I tell you beforehand, nothing will really surprise you; nothing\r\nwhatever!”\r\n\r\nMariana wanted to ask him what he meant, but at that moment Solomin\r\nentered the room.\r\n\r\nHis movements were sharper and more rapid than usual. His eyes were half\r\nclosed, his lips compressed, the whole of his face wore a drier, harder,\r\nsomewhat rougher expression.\r\n\r\n“My dear friends,” he began, “I must ask you not to waste time, but\r\nprepare yourselves as soon as possible. You must be ready in an hour.\r\nYou have to go through the marriage ceremony. There is no news of\r\nPaklin. His horses were detained for a time at Arjanov and then sent\r\nback. He has been kept there. They’ve no doubt brought him to town by\r\nthis time. I don’t think he would betray us, but he might let things out\r\nunwittingly. Besides, they might have guessed from the horses. My cousin\r\nhas been informed of your coming. Pavel will go with you. He will be a\r\nwitness.”\r\n\r\n“And you... and you?” Nejdanov asked. “Aren’t you going? I see you’re\r\ndressed for the road,” he added, indicating Solomin’s high boots with\r\nhis eyes.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I only put them on... because it’s rather muddy outside.”\r\n\r\n“But you won’t be held responsible for us, will you?”\r\n\r\n“I hardly think so... in any case... that’s my affair. So you’ll be\r\nready in an hour. Mariana, I believe Tatiana wants to see you. She has\r\nsomething prepared for you.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes! I wanted to see her too....” Mariana turned to the door.\r\n\r\nA peculiar expression of fear, despair, spread itself over Nejdanov’s\r\nface.\r\n\r\n“Mariana, you’re not going?” he asked in a frightened tone of voice.\r\n\r\nShe stood still.\r\n\r\n“I’ll be back in half an hour. It won’t take me long to pack.”\r\n\r\n“Come here, close to me, Mariana——”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, but what for?”\r\n\r\n“I wanted to have one more look at you.” He looked at her intently.\r\n“Goodbye, goodbye, Mariana!”\r\n\r\nShe seemed bewildered.\r\n\r\n“Why... what nonsense I’m talking! You’ll be back in half an hour, won’t\r\nyou, eh?”\r\n\r\n“Of course—”\r\n\r\n“Never mind; forgive me, dear. My brain is in a whirl from lack of\r\nsleep. I must begin... packing, too.”\r\n\r\nMariana went out of the room and Solomin was about to follow her when\r\nNejdanov stopped him.\r\n\r\n“Solomin!”\r\n\r\n“What is it?”\r\n\r\n“Give me your hand. I must thank you for your kindness and hospitality.”\r\n\r\nSolomin smiled.\r\n\r\n“What an idea!” He extended his hand.\r\n\r\n“There’s another thing I wished to say,” Nejdanov continued. “Supposing\r\nanything were to happen to me, may I hope that you won’t abandon\r\nMariana?”\r\n\r\n“Your future wife?”\r\n\r\n“Yes... Mariana!”\r\n\r\n“I don’t think anything is likely to happen to you, but you may set your\r\nmind at rest. Mariana is just as dear to me as she is to you.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I knew it... knew it, knew it! I’m so glad! thanks. So in an hour?”\r\n\r\n“In an hour.”\r\n\r\n“I shall be ready. Goodbye, my friend!”\r\n\r\nSolomin went out and caught Mariana up on the staircase. He had intended\r\nsaying something to her about Nejdanov, but refrained from doing so. And\r\nMariana guessed that he wished to say something about him and that he\r\ncould not. She, too, was silent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVII\r\n\r\nDirectly Solomin had gone, Nejdanov jumped up from the couch, walked\r\nup and down the room several times, then stood still in the middle in\r\na sort of stony indecision. Suddenly he threw off his “masquerade”\r\n costume, kicked it into a corner of the room, and put on his own\r\nclothes. He then went up to the little three-legged table, pulled out of\r\na drawer two sealed letters and some other object which he thrust into\r\nhis pocket; the letters he left on the table. Then he crouched down\r\nbefore the stove and opened the little door. A whole heap of ashes lay\r\ninside. This was all that remained of Nejdanov’s papers, of his sacred\r\nbook of verses.... He had burned them all in the night. Leaning against\r\none side of the stove was Mariana’s portrait that Markelov had given\r\nhim. He had evidently not had the heart to burn that too! He took it out\r\ncarefully and put in on the table beside the two letters.\r\n\r\nThen, with a quick resolute movement, he put on his cap and walked\r\ntowards the door. But suddenly he stopped, turned back, and went into\r\nMariana’s room. There, he stood still for a moment, gazed round, then\r\napproaching her narrow little bed, bent down and with one stifled sob\r\npressed his lips to the foot of the bed. He then jumped up, thrust his\r\ncap over his forehead, and rushed out. Without meeting anyone in the\r\ncorridor, on the stairs, or down below, he darted out into the garden.\r\nIt was a grey day, with a low-hanging sky and a damp breeze that blew in\r\nwaves over the tops of the grass and made the trees rustle. A whiff of\r\ncoal, tar, and tallow was borne along from the yard, but the noise and\r\nrattling in the factory was fainter than usual at that time of day.\r\nNejdanov looked round sharply to see if anyone was about and made\r\nstraight for the old apple tree that had first attracted his attention\r\nwhen he had looked out of the little window of his room on the day of\r\nhis arrival. The whole of its trunk was evergrown with dry moss, its\r\nbare, rugged branches, sparsely covered with reddish leaves, rose\r\ncrookedly, like some old arms held up in supplication. Nejdanov stepped\r\nfirmly on to the dark soil beneath the tree and pulled out the object he\r\nhad taken from the table drawer. He looked up intently at the windows of\r\nthe little house. “If somebody were to see me now, perhaps I wouldn’t\r\ndo it,” he thought. But no human being was to be seen anywhere—everyone\r\nseemed dead or turned away from him, leaving him to the mercy of fate.\r\nOnly the muffled hum and roar of the factory betrayed any signs of life;\r\nand overhead a fine, keen, chilly rain began falling.\r\n\r\nNejdanov gazed up through the crooked branches of the tree under which\r\nhe was standing at the grey, cloudy sky looking down upon him so\r\nunfeelingly. He yawned and lay down. “There’s nothing else to be done.\r\nI can’t go back to St. Petersburg, to prison,” he thought. A kind of\r\npleasant heaviness spread all over his body.... He threw away his cap,\r\ntook up the revolver, and pulled the trigger.... Something struck him\r\ninstantly, but with no very great violence.... He was lying on his back\r\ntrying to make out what had happened to him and how it was that he had\r\njust seen Tatiana. He tried to call her... but a peculiar numbness had\r\ntaken possession of him and curious dark green spots were whirling\r\nabout all over him—in his eyes, over his head, in his brain—and some\r\nfrightfully heavy, dull weight seemed to press him to the earth for\r\never.\r\n\r\nNejdanov did really get a glimpse of Tatiana. At the moment when he\r\npulled the trigger she had looked out of a window and caught sight of\r\nhim standing under the tree. She had hardly time to ask herself what\r\nhe was doing there in the rain without a hat, when he rolled to the\r\nground like a sheaf of corn. She did not hear the shot—it was very\r\nfaint—but instantly felt that something was amiss and rushed out into\r\nthe garden.... She came up to Nejdanov, breathless.\r\n\r\n“Alexai Dmitritch! What is the matter with you?”\r\n\r\nBut a darkness had already descended upon him. Tatiana bent over and\r\nnoticed blood...\r\n\r\n“Pavel!” she shouted at the top of her voice, “Pavel!”\r\n\r\nA minute or two later, Mariana, Solomin, Pavel, and two workmen were in\r\nthe garden. They lifted him instantly, carried him into the house, and\r\nlaid him on the same couch on which he had passed his last night.\r\n\r\nHe lay on his back with half-closed eyes, his face blue all over. There\r\nwas a rattling in his throat, and every now and again he gave a choking\r\nsob. Life had not yet left him. Mariana and Solomin were standing on\r\neither side of him, almost as pale as he was himself. They both felt\r\ncrushed, stunned, especially Mariana—but they were not surprised. “How\r\ndid we not foresee this?” they asked themselves, but it seemed to them\r\nthat they had foreseen it all along. When he said to Mariana, “Whatever\r\nI do, I tell you beforehand, nothing will really surprise you,” and when\r\nhe had spoken of the two men in him that would not let each other live,\r\nhad she not felt a kind of vague presentiment? Then why had she ignored\r\nit? Why was it she did not now dare to look at Solomin, as though he\r\nwere her accomplice...as though he, too, were conscience-stricken? Why\r\nwas it that her unutterable, despairing pity for Nejdanov was mixed with\r\na feeling of horror, dread, and shame? Perhaps she could have saved him?\r\nWhy are they both standing there, not daring to pronounce a word, hardly\r\ndaring to breathe—waiting ... for what? Oh, God!\r\n\r\nSolomin sent for a doctor, though there was no hope. Tatiana bathed\r\nNejdanov’s head with cold water and vinegar and laid a cold sponge on\r\nthe small, dark wound, now free from blood. Suddenly the rattling in\r\nNejdanov’s throat ceased and he stirred a little.\r\n\r\n“He is coming to himself,” Solomin whispered. Mariana dropped down on\r\nher knees before him. Nejdanov glanced at her ... up until then his eyes\r\nhad borne that fixed, far-away look of the dying.\r\n\r\n“I am ... still alive,” he pronounced scarcely audible. “I couldn’t even\r\ndo this properly.... I am detaining ... you.”\r\n\r\n“Aliosha!” Mariana sobbed out.\r\n\r\n“It won’t ... be long.... Do you ... remember ... Mariana ... my\r\npoem?... Surround me with flowers.... But where ... are the ...\r\nflowers? Never mind ... so long as you ... are here. There ... in ...\r\nmy letter....”\r\n\r\nHe suddenly shuddered.\r\n\r\n“Ah! here it comes.... Take ... each other’s hands ... before me ...\r\nquickly ... take....”\r\n\r\nSolomin seized Mariana’s hand. Her head lay on the couch, face\r\ndownwards, close to the wound. Solomin, dark as night, held himself\r\nseverely erect.\r\n\r\n“That’s right ... that’s....”\r\n\r\nNejdanov broke out into sobs again—strange unusual sobs... His breast\r\nrose, his sides heaved.\r\n\r\nHe tried to lay his hand on their united ones, but it fell back dead.\r\n\r\n“He is passing away,” Tatiana whispered as she stood at the door, and\r\nbegan crossing herself.\r\n\r\nHis sobs grew briefer, fewer.... He still searched around for Mariana\r\nwith his eyes, but a menacing white film was spreading over them....\r\n\r\n“That’s right,” were his last words.\r\n\r\nHe had breathed his last... and the clasped hands of Mariana and Solomin\r\nstill lay upon his breast.\r\n\r\nThe following are the contents of the two letters he had left. One\r\nconsisting only of a few lines, was addressed to Silin:\r\n\r\n“Goodbye, my dear friend, goodbye! When this reaches you, I shall be no\r\nmore. Don’t ask why or wherefore, and don’t grieve; be sure that I\r\nam better off now. Take up our immortal Pushkin and read over the\r\ndescription of the death of Lensky in ‘Yevgenia Onegin.’ Do you\r\nremember? The windows are white-washed. The mistress has gone—that’s\r\nall. There is nothing more for me to say. Were I to say all I wanted to,\r\nit would take up too much time. But I could not leave this world without\r\ntelling you, or you might have gone on thinking of me as living and I\r\nshould have put a stain upon our friendship. Goodbye; live well.—Your\r\nfriend, A. N.”\r\n\r\nThe other letter, somewhat longer, was addressed to Solomin and Mariana.\r\nIt began thus:\r\n\r\n“MY DEAR CHILDREN” (immediately after these words there was a break, as\r\nif something had been scratched or smeared out, as if tears had fallen\r\nupon it),—“It may seem strange to you that I should address you in\r\nthis way—I am almost a child myself and you, Solomin, are older than I\r\nam. But I am about to die—and standing as I do at the end of my life,\r\nI look upon myself as an old man. I have wronged you both, especially\r\nyou, Mariana, by causing you so much grief and pain (I know you will\r\ngrieve, Mariana) and giving you so much anxiety. But what could I do?\r\nI could think of no other way out. I could not _simplify_ myself, so\r\nthe only thing left for me to do was to blot myself out altogether.\r\nMariana, I would have been a burden to you and to myself. You are\r\ngenerous, you would have borne the burden gladly, as a new sacrifice,\r\nbut I have no right to demand such a sacrifice of you—you have a higher\r\nand better work before you. My children, let me unite you as it were\r\nfrom the grave. You will live happily together. Mariana, I know you\r\nwill come to love Solomin—and he ... he loved you from the moment he\r\nfirst saw you at the Sipiagins. It was no secret to me, although we ran\r\naway a few days later. Ah! that glorious morning! how exquisite and\r\nfresh and young it was! It comes back to me now as a token, a symbol\r\nof your life together—your life and his—and I by the merest chance\r\nhappened to be in his place. But enough! I don’t want to complain, I\r\nonly want to justify myself. Some very sorrowful moments are in store\r\nfor you tomorrow. But what could I do? There was no other alternative.\r\nGoodbye, Mariana, my dear good girl! Goodbye, Solomin! I leave her in\r\nyour charge. Be happy together; live for the sake of others. And you,\r\nMariana, think of me only when you are happy. Think of me as a man who\r\nhad also some good in him, but for whom it was better to die than to\r\nlive. Did I really love you? I don’t know, dear friend. But I do know\r\nthat I never loved anyone more than you, and that it would have been\r\nmore terrible for me to die had I not that feeling for you to carry\r\naway with me to the grave. Mariana, if you ever come across a Miss\r\nMashurina—Solomin knows her, and by the way, I think you’ve met her\r\ntoo—tell her that I thought of her with gratitude just before the end.\r\nShe will understand. But I must tear myself away at last. I looked\r\nout of the window just now and saw a lovely star amidst the swiftly\r\nmoving clouds. No matter how quickly they chased one another, they\r\ncould not hide it from view. That star reminded me of you, Mariana. At\r\nthis moment you are asleep in the next room, unsuspecting.... I went to\r\nyour door, listened, and fancied I heard your pure, calm breathing....\r\nGoodbye! goodbye! goodbye, my children, my friends!—Yours, A.\r\n\r\n“Dear me! how is it that in my final letter I made no mention of our\r\ngreat cause? I suppose lying is of no use when you’re on the point of\r\ndeath. Forgive this postscript, Mariana.... The falsehood lies in me,\r\nnot in the thing in which you believe! One more word. You might have\r\nthought perhaps, Mariana, that I put an end to myself merely because I\r\nwas afraid of going to prison, but believe me that is not true. There\r\nis nothing terrible about going to prison in itself, but being shut up\r\nthere for a cause in which you have no faith is unthinkable. It was not\r\nfear of prison that drove me to this, Mariana. Goodbye! goodbye! my\r\ndear, pure girl.”\r\n\r\nMariana and Solomin each read the letter in turn. She then put her\r\nown portrait and the two letters into her pocket and remained standing\r\nmotionless.\r\n\r\n“Let us go, Mariana; everything is ready. We must fulfil his wish,”\r\n Solomin said to her.\r\n\r\nMariana drew near to Nejdanov and pressed her lips against his forehead\r\nwhich was already turning cold.\r\n\r\n“Come,” she said, turning to Solomin. They went out, hand in hand.\r\n\r\nWhen the police arrived at the factory a few hours later, they found\r\nNejdanov’s corpse. Tatiana had laid out the body, put a white pillow\r\nunder his head, crossed his arms, and even placed a bunch of flowers\r\non a little table beside him. Pavel, who had been given all the needful\r\ninstructions, received the police officers with the greatest respect and\r\nas great a contempt, so that those worthies were not quite sure whether\r\nto thank or arrest him. He gave them all the details of the suicide,\r\nregaled them with Swiss cheese and Madeira, but as for the whereabouts\r\nof Vassily Fedotitch and the young lady, he knew nothing of that. He was\r\nmost effusive in his assurances that Vassily Fedotitch was never away\r\nfor long at a time on account of his work, that he was sure to be back\r\neither today or tomorrow, and that he would let them know as soon as he\r\narrived. They might depend on him!\r\n\r\nSo the officers went away no wiser than they had come, leaving a guard\r\nin charge of the body and promising to send a coroner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVIII\r\n\r\nTwo days after these events, a cart drove up the courtyard of the worthy\r\nFather Zosim, containing a man and woman who are already known to the\r\nreader. The following day they were legally married. Soon afterwards\r\nthey disappeared, and the good father never regretted what he had done.\r\nSolomin had left a letter in Pavel’s charge, addressed to the proprietor\r\nof the factory, giving a full statement of the condition of the business\r\n(it turned out most flourishing) and asking for three months’ leave. The\r\nletter was dated two days before Nejdanov’s death, from which might be\r\ngathered that Solomin had considered it necessary even then to go away\r\nwith him and Mariana and hide for a time. Nothing was revealed by the\r\ninquiry held over the suicide. The body was buried. Sipiagin gave up\r\nsearching for his niece.\r\n\r\nNine months later Markelov was tried. At the trial he was just as calm\r\nas he had been at the governor’s. He carried himself with dignity, but\r\nwas rather depressed. His habitual hardness had toned down somewhat, not\r\nfrom any cowardice; a nobler element had been at work. He did not defend\r\nhimself, did not regret what he had done, blamed no one, and mentioned\r\nno names. His emaciated face with the lustreless eyes retained but one\r\nexpression: submission to his fate and firmness. His brief, direct,\r\ntruthful answers aroused in his very judges a feeling akin to pity. Even\r\nthe peasants who had seized him and were giving evidence against\r\nhim shared this feeling and spoke of him as a good, simple-hearted\r\ngentleman. But his guilt could not possibly be passed over; he could not\r\nescape punishment, and he himself seemed to look upon it as his due. Of\r\nhis few accomplices, Mashurina disappeared for a time. Ostrodumov was\r\nkilled by a shopkeeper he was inciting to revolt, who had struck him\r\nan “awkward” blow. Golushkin, in consideration of his penitence (he was\r\nnearly frightened out of his wits), was let off lightly. Kisliakov was\r\nkept under arrest for about a month, after which he was released and\r\neven allowed to continue “galloping” from province to province. Nejdanov\r\ndied, Solomin was under suspicion, but for lack of sufficient evidence\r\nwas left in peace. (He did not, however, avoid trial and appeared when\r\nwanted.) Mariana was not even mentioned; Paklin came off splendidly;\r\nindeed no notice was taken of him.\r\n\r\nA year and a half had gone by—it was the winter of 1870. In St.\r\nPetersburg—the very same St. Petersburg where the chamberlain Sipiagin,\r\nnow a privy councillor, was beginning to play such an important part;\r\nwhere his wife patronised the arts, gave musical evenings, and founded\r\ncharitable cook-shops; where Kollomietzev was considered one of the most\r\nhopeful members of the ministerial department—a little man was limping\r\nalong one of the streets of the Vassily island, attired in a shabby coat\r\nwith a catskin collar. This was no other than our old friend Paklin.\r\nHe had changed a great deal since we last saw him. On his temples a few\r\nstrands of silvery hair peeped out from under his fur cap. A tall, stout\r\nwoman, closely muffled in a dark cloth coat, was coming towards him on\r\nthe pavement. Paklin looked at her indifferently and passed on. Suddenly\r\nhe stopped, threw up his arms as though struck by something, turned back\r\nquickly, and overtaking her peeped under her hat.\r\n\r\n“Mashurina!” he exclaimed in an undertone.\r\n\r\nThe lady looked at him haughtily and walked on without saying a word.\r\n\r\n“Dear Mashurina, I recognised you at once,” Paklin continued, hobbling\r\nalong beside her; “don’t be afraid, I won’t give you away! I am so glad\r\nto see you! I’m Paklin, Sila Paklin, you know, Nejdanov’s friend. Do\r\ncome home with me. I live quite near here. Do come!”\r\n\r\n_“Io sono contessa Rocca di Santo Fiume!”_ the lady said softly, but in\r\na wonderfully pure Russian accent.\r\n\r\n“Contessa! nonsense! Do come in and let us talk about old times—”\r\n\r\n“Where do you live?” the Italian countess asked suddenly in Russian.\r\n“I’m in a hurry.”\r\n\r\n“In this very street; in that grey three-storied house over there. It’s\r\nso nice of you not to have snubbed me! Give me your hand, come on. Have\r\nyou been here long? How do you come to be a countess? Have you married\r\nan Italian count?”\r\n\r\nMashurina had not married an Italian count. She had been provided with\r\na passport made out in the name of a certain Countess Rocca di Santo\r\nFiume, who had died a short time ago, and had come quite calmly to\r\nRussia, though she did not know a single word of Italian and had the\r\nmost typical of Russian faces.\r\n\r\nPaklin brought her to his humble little lodging. His humpbacked sister\r\nwho shared it with him came out to greet them from behind the partition\r\ndividing the kitchen from the passage.\r\n\r\n“Here, Snapotchka,” he said, “let me introduce you to a great friend of\r\nmine. We should like some tea as soon as you can get it.”\r\n\r\nMashurina, who would on no account have come had not Paklin mentioned\r\nNejdanov, bowed, then taking off her hat and passing her masculine hand\r\nthrough her closely cropped hair, sat down in silence. She had scarcely\r\nchanged at all; even her dress was the same she had worn two years ago;\r\nonly her eyes wore a fixed, sad expression, giving a pathetic look to\r\nher usually hard face. Snandulia went out for the samovar, while Paklin\r\nsat down opposite Mashurina and stroked her knee sympathetically. His\r\nhead dropped on his breast, he could not speak from choking, and the\r\ntears glistened in his eyes. Mashurina sat erect and motionless, gazing\r\nseverely to one side.\r\n\r\n“Those were times!” Paklin began at last. “As I look at you everything\r\ncomes back to me, the living and the dead. Even my little poll-parrots\r\nare no more.... I don’t think you knew them, by the way. They both died\r\non the same day, as I always predicted they would. And Nejdanov... poor\r\nNejdanov! I suppose you know——”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know,” Mashurina interrupted him, still looking away.\r\n\r\n“And do you know about Ostrodumov too?”\r\n\r\nMashurina merely nodded her head. She wanted him to go on talking about\r\nNejdanov, but could not bring herself to ask him. He understood her,\r\nhowever.\r\n\r\n“I was told that he mentioned you in the letter he left. Was it true?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” Mashurina replied after a pause.\r\n\r\n“What a splendid chap he was! He didn’t fall into the right rut somehow.\r\nHe was about as fitted to be a revolutionist as I am! Do you know what\r\nhe really was? The idealist of realism. Do you understand me?”\r\n\r\nMashurina flung him a rapid glance. She did not understand him and did\r\nnot want to understand him. It seemed to her impertinent that he should\r\ncompare himself to Nejdanov. “Let him brag!” she thought, though he was\r\nnot bragging at all, but rather depreciating himself, according to his\r\nown ideas.\r\n\r\n“Some fellow called Silin sought me out; Nejdanov, it seems, had left\r\na letter for him too. Well, he wanted to know if Alexai had left any\r\npapers, but we hunted through all his things and found nothing. He\r\nmust have burned everything, even his poems. Did you know that he wrote\r\nverses? I’m sorry they were destroyed; there must have been some good\r\nthings among them. They all vanished with him—became lost in the\r\ngeneral whirl, dead and gone for ever. Nothing was left except the\r\nmemories of his friends—until they, too, vanish in their turn!”\r\n\r\nPaklin ceased.\r\n\r\n“Do you remember the Sipiagins?” he began again; “those respectable,\r\npatronising, loathsome swells are now at the very height of power and\r\nglory.” Mashurina, of course, did not remember the Sipiagins, but Paklin\r\nhated them so much that he could not keep from abusing them on every\r\npossible occasion. “They say there’s such a high tone in their house!\r\nthey’re always talking about virtue! It’s a bad sign, I think. Reminds\r\nme rather of an over-scented sick room. There must be some bad smell to\r\nconceal. Poor Alexai! It was they who ruined him!”\r\n\r\n“And what is Solomin doing?” Mashurina asked. She had suddenly ceased\r\nwishing to hear Paklin talk about _him_.\r\n\r\n“Solomin!” Paklin exclaimed. “He’s a clever chap! turned out well too.\r\nHe’s left the old factory and taken all the best men with him. There was\r\none fellow there called Pavel—could do anything; he’s taken him along\r\ntoo. They say he has a small factory of his own now, somewhere near\r\nPerm, run on cooperative lines. He’s all right! he’ll stick to anything\r\nhe undertakes. Got some grit in him! His strength lies in the fact that\r\nhe doesn’t attempt to cure all the social ills with one blow. What a\r\nrum set we are to be sure, we Russians! We sit down quietly and wait for\r\nsomething or someone to come along and cure us all at once; heal all our\r\nwounds, pull out all our diseases, like a bad tooth. But who or what\r\nis to work this magic spell, Darwinism, the land, the Archbishop\r\nPerepentiev, a foreign war, we don’t know and don’t care, but we must\r\nhave our tooth pulled out for us! It’s nothing but mere idleness,\r\nsluggishness, want of thinking. Solomin, on the other hand, is\r\ndifferent; he doesn’t go in for pulling teeth—he knows what he’s\r\nabout!”\r\n\r\nMashurina gave an impatient wave of the hand, as though she wished to\r\ndismiss the subject.\r\n\r\n“And that girl,” she began, “I forget her name... the one who ran away\r\nwith Nejdanov—what became of her?”\r\n\r\n“Mariana? She’s Solomin’s wife now. They married over a year ago. It was\r\nmerely for the sake of formality at first, but now they say she really\r\nis his wife.”\r\n\r\nMashurina gave another impatient gesture. There was a time when she was\r\njealous of Mariana, but now she was indignant with her for having been\r\nfalse to Nejdanov’s memory.\r\n\r\n“I suppose they have a baby by now,” she said in an offhanded tone.\r\n\r\n“I really don’t know. But where are you off to?” Paklin asked, seeing\r\nthat she had taken up her hat. “Do stay a little longer; my sister will\r\nbring us some tea directly.”\r\n\r\nIt was not so much that he wanted Mashurina to stay, as that he\r\ncould not let an opportunity slip by of giving utterance to what had\r\naccumulated and was boiling over in his breast. Since his return to St.\r\nPetersburg he had seen very little of people, especially of the younger\r\ngeneration. The Nejdanov affair had scared him; he grew more cautious,\r\navoided society, and the young generation on their side looked upon him\r\nwith suspicion. Once someone had even called him a traitor to his face.\r\n\r\nAs he was not fond of associating with the elder generation, it\r\nsometimes fell to his lot to be silent for weeks. To his sister he\r\ncould not speak out freely, not because he considered her too stupid\r\nto understand him—oh, no! he had the highest opinion of her\r\nintelligence—but as soon as he began letting off some of his pet\r\nfireworks she would look at him with those sad reproachful eyes of hers,\r\nmaking him feel quite ashamed. And really, how is a man to go through\r\nlife without letting off just a few squibs every now and again? So life\r\nin St. Petersburg became insupportable to Paklin and he longed to remove\r\nto Moscow. Speculations of all sorts—ideas, fancies, and sarcasms—were\r\nstored up in him like water in a closed mill. The floodgates could not\r\nbe opened and the water grew stagnant. With the appearance of Mashurina\r\nthe gates opened wide, and all his pent-up ideas came pouring out with a\r\nrush. He talked about St. Petersburg, St. Petersburg life, the whole of\r\nRussia. No one was spared! Mashurina was very little interested in\r\nall this, but she did not contradict or interrupt, and that was all he\r\nwanted of her.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he began, “a fine time we are living in, I can assure you!\r\nSociety in a state of absolute stagnation; everyone bored to death! As\r\nfor literature, it’s been reduced to a complete vacuum swept clean!\r\nTake criticism for example. If a promising young critic has to say,\r\n‘It’s natural for a hen to lay eggs,’ it takes him at least twenty\r\nwhole pages to expound this mighty truth, and even then he doesn’t\r\nquite manage it! They’re as puffed up as feather-beds, these fine\r\ngentlemen, as soft-soapy as can be, and are always in raptures over\r\nthe merest commonplaces! As for science, ha, ha, ha! we too have our\r\nlearned _Kant_! [The word _kant_ in Russian means a kind of braid or\r\npiping.] on the collars of our engineers! And it’s no better in art!\r\nYou go to a concert and listen to our national singer Agremantsky.\r\nEveryone is raving about him. But he has no more voice than a cat! Even\r\nSkoropikin, you know, our immortal Aristarchus, rings his praises.\r\n‘Here is something,’ he declares, ‘quite unlike Western art!’ Then he\r\nraves about our insignificant painters too! ‘At one time, I bowed down\r\nbefore Europe and the Italians,’ he says, ‘but I’ve heard Rossini and\r\nseen Raphael and confess I was not at all impressed.’ And our young\r\nmen just go about repeating what he says and feel quite satisfied with\r\nthemselves. And meanwhile the people are dying of hunger, crushed\r\ndown by taxes. The only reform that has been accomplished is that\r\nthe men have taken to wearing caps and the women have left off their\r\nhead-dresses! And the poverty! the drunkenness! the usury!”\r\n\r\nBut at this point Mashurina yawned and Paklin saw that he must change\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\n“You haven’t told me yet,” he said, turning to her, “where you’ve\r\nbeen these two years; when you came back, what you’ve been doing with\r\nyourself, and how you managed to turn into an Italian countess—”\r\n\r\n“There is no need for you to know all that,” she put in. “It can hardly\r\nhave any interest for you now. You see, you are no longer of our camp.”\r\n\r\nPaklin felt a pang and gave a forced laugh to hide his confusion.\r\n\r\n“As you please,” he said; “I know I’m regarded as out-of-date by the\r\npresent generation, and really I can hardly count myself.. . of those\r\nranks—” He did not finish the sentence. “Here comes Snapotchka with the\r\ntea. Take a cup with us and stay a little longer. Perhaps I may tell you\r\nsomething of interest to you.”\r\n\r\nMashurina took a cup of tea and began sipping it with a lump of sugar in\r\nher mouth.\r\n\r\nPaklin laughed heartily.\r\n\r\n“It’s a good thing the police are not here to see an Italian countess—”\r\n\r\n“Rocca di Santo Fiume,” Mashurina put in solemnly, sipping the hot tea.\r\n\r\n“Contessa Rocca di Santo Fiume!” Paklin repeated after her; “and\r\ndrinking her tea in the typical Russian way! That’s rather suspicious,\r\nyou know! The police would be on the alert in an instant.”\r\n\r\n“Some fellow in uniform bothered me when I was abroad,” Mashurina\r\nremarked. “He kept on asking so many questions until I couldn’t stand it\r\nany longer. ‘Leave me alone, for heaven’s sake!’ I said to him at last.”\r\n\r\n“In Italian?”\r\n\r\n“Oh no, in Russian.”\r\n\r\n“And what did he do?”\r\n\r\n“Went away, of course.”\r\n\r\n“Bravo!” Paklin exclaimed. “Well, countess, have another cup. There is\r\njust one other thing I wanted to say to you. It seemed to me that you\r\nexpressed yourself rather contemptuously of Solomin. But I tell you that\r\npeople like him are the real men! It’s difficult to understand them at\r\nfirst, but, believe me, they’re the real men. The future is in their\r\nhands. They are not heroes, not even ‘heroes of labour’ as some crank\r\nof an American, or Englishman, called them in a book he wrote for the\r\nedification of us heathens, but they are robust, strong, dull men of the\r\npeople. They are exactly what we want just now. You have only to look at\r\nSolomin. A head as clear as the day and a body as strong as an ox. Isn’t\r\nthat a wonder in itself? Why, any man with us in Russia who has had any\r\nbrains, or feelings, or a conscience, has always been a physical wreck.\r\nSolomin’s heart aches just as ours does; he hates the same things that\r\nwe hate, but his nerves are of iron and his body is under his full\r\ncontrol. He’s a splendid man, I tell you! Why, think of it! here is\r\na man with ideals, and no nonsense about him; educated and from the\r\npeople, simple, yet all there.... What more do you want?\r\n\r\n“It’s of no consequence,” Paklin continued, working himself up more and\r\nmore, without noticing that Mashurina had long ago ceased listening to\r\nhim and was looking away somewhere, “it’s of no consequence that Russia\r\nis now full of all sorts of queer people, fanatics, officials, generals\r\nplain and decorated, Epicureans, imitators, all manner of cranks. I once\r\nknew a lady, a certain Havrona Prishtekov, who, one fine day, suddenly\r\nturned a legitimist and assured everybody that when she died they had\r\nonly to open her body and the name of Henry V. would be found engraven\r\non her heart! All these people do not count, my dear lady; our true\r\nsalvation lies with the Solomins, the dull, plain, but wise Solomins!\r\nRemember that I say this to you in the winter of 1870, when Germany is\r\npreparing to crush France—”\r\n\r\n“Silishka,” Snandulia’s soft voice was heard from behind Paklin, “I\r\nthink in your speculations about the future you have quite forgotten\r\nour religion and its influence. And besides,” she added hastily, “Miss\r\nMashurina is not listening to you. You had much better offer her some\r\nmore tea.”\r\n\r\nPaklin pulled himself up.\r\n\r\n“Why, of course... do have some more tea.”\r\n\r\nBut Mashurina fixed her dark eyes upon him and said pensively:\r\n\r\n“You don’t happen to have any letter of Nejdanov’s... or his\r\nphotograph?”\r\n\r\n“I have a photograph and quite a good one too. I believe it’s in the\r\ntable drawer. I’ll get it in a minute.”\r\n\r\nHe began rummaging about in the drawer, while Snandulia went up to\r\nMashurina and with a long, intent look full of sympathy, clasped her\r\nhand like a comrade.\r\n\r\n“Here it is!” Paklin exclaimed and handed her the photograph.\r\n\r\nMashurina thrust it into her pocket quickly, scarcely glancing at it,\r\nand without a word of thanks, flushing bright red, she put on her hat\r\nand made for the door.\r\n\r\n“Are you going?” Paklin asked. “Where do you live? You might tell me\r\nthat at any rate.”\r\n\r\n“Wherever I happen to be.”\r\n\r\n“I understand. You don’t want me to know. Tell me at least, are you\r\nstill working under Vassily Nikolaevitch?”\r\n\r\n“What does it matter to you?”\r\n\r\n“Or someone else, perhaps Sidor Sidoritch?”\r\n\r\nMashurina did not reply.\r\n\r\n“Or is your director some anonymous person?” Mashurina had already\r\nstepped across the threshold. “Perhaps it is someone anonymous!”\r\n\r\nShe slammed the door.\r\n\r\nPaklin stood for a long time motionless before this closed door.\r\n\r\n“Anonymous Russia!” he said at last.",
