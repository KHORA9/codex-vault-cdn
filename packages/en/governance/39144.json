Here we renew our youth, and far from\r\ntumult and crowds, near to nature, we realize anew how little is\r\nrequired in order to be contented and happy. Here I am taken back to the\r\nmemories of my childhood in the little town in Georgia where too our\r\nhome was a log house, but for appearances had the luxurious outer and\r\ninner dressing of clap-boarding painted white. The logs of the upper\r\nstory where we children played and slept had no covering, which pleased\r\nus all the more.\r\n\r\nIn a highly organized society, we are often attracted by pomp and\r\ncircumstance, rather than by qualities of heart and mind, which after\r\nall are the true measure of enlightenment. Here in these woods, fair\r\ndealings and human relations are not regulated by statutes, but by the\r\ngolden rule of conduct. We need not hide our possessions behind locked\r\ndoors, honesty is the accepted rule of life; there are no treasures to\r\nhide and no bars to break.\r\n\r\nIt has been permitted me to do useful work and to have interesting\r\nexperiences. Privileged opportunities have been afforded me for public\r\nservice. Of these I write.\r\n\r\nPerhaps in chronicling the experiences of a life which at many points\r\ntouched vital affairs and the most interesting personalities, I may be\r\nable to add something to the record of men, movements, and events during\r\nthose decades still absorbing to us because they are so near.\r\n\r\nThe story is one of service at home and abroad, of personal relations\r\nwith six of our Presidents, with diplomats, labor leaders, foreign\r\nrulers, leaders of industry, and some plain unticketed citizens who were\r\nthe salt of the earth and certainly not the least of those whom it was a\r\npleasure to know.\r\n\r\nTo write of one's self requires a certain amount of egotism. The\r\nautobiographer usually tries to justify this vanity by explaining it as\r\na desire to gratify his children and kinsmen, or as a yielding to the\r\nurgent request of his friends. Benjamin Franklin, whose autobiography,\r\nincomplete though it be, is one of the most human in our language,\r\nfrankly conceded that he was prompted by the weakness of praise. He\r\nsays: \"I may as well confess it, since my denial of it will be believed\r\nby nobody, perhaps I shall a good deal gratify my own vanity.\"\r\n\r\nI do not wish to conceal from those who may from interest or curiosity\r\nread what I write, that I am not entirely free from that vanity, even\r\nthough it be my chief aim and purpose to cast some additional light upon\r\nour country's development and upon events in which, in public and\r\nprivate life, I have been permitted to take part. Having held official\r\npositions at home and abroad under four administrations, and having come\r\nin close relationship with many of the statesmen and others of\r\ndistinction in this and foreign countries, perhaps my narrative will\r\nserve to give more intimate knowledge and truer appreciation of their\r\npersonal traits and their exceptional qualities.\r\n\r\nI have also been influenced by a desire to bring a message of\r\nencouragement to the youth of our country, especially to those who may\r\nbe conscious of handicaps in the race, not to lose heart, but to be\r\npatient, considerate, and tactful, and not to withhold the saving extra\r\nounce of effort which often spells the difference between failure and\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nSo long as our democracy remains true to its basic principles and\r\njealously guards the highways of opportunity, the golden age will not be\r\nin the past, but ever in the future. In externals the age in which we\r\nlive has changed, but the qualities of effort, of industry, and the will\r\nto succeed which were required when I was a boy, have not changed; they\r\nlead to the same goals now as then, with this difference: that the boy\r\nof to-day has greater advantages, better educational facilities, and\r\nmore avenues of advancement than the boy of two generations ago. There\r\nnever was a time in our history when more men of humble origin have\r\nattained commanding positions in industry, in commerce, and in public\r\naffairs than now. While our American system is not without fault, the\r\nfact that an enlightened public is ever watchful to maintain our\r\ndemocratic principles and to correct abuses is convincing proof of our\r\ncountry's wholesome development in conformity with the changing\r\nconditions of modern life.\r\n\r\nI desire to make acknowledgment to my long-time and esteemed friend, Mr.\r\nLawrence Abbott, the President of \"The Outlook,\" who encouraged and\r\nadvised me to write these memoirs and even outlined the chapter plan\r\nwhich I have largely followed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  I.

Up to the time of Napoleon's taking possession of that part of\r\nthe country the Jews of the Palatinate had not adopted family names.\r\nThis they did later, beginning in 1808, when, under Napoleon, the\r\nPalatinate became the Department of Mont Tennerre and part of France. My\r\ngreat-grandfather, for instance, before adopting the family name of\r\nStraus, was known as Jacob Lazar, from Jacob ben Lazarus, or Jacob son\r\nof Lazarus, as in biblical times.\r\n\r\nJacob Lazar, afterwards Jacob Straus, had three sons: Jacob, Lazarus,\r\nand Salomon. My father, Lazarus Straus, born April 25, 1809, was the son\r\nof the eldest, Jacob; and my mother, Sara Straus, born January 14,\r\n1823, was the daughter of the youngest, Salomon. My paternal grandfather\r\ndied when my father was a young man, but my grandfather Salomon Straus\r\nand his brother Lazarus were known to us as children, particularly to my\r\neldest brother, Isidor, who knew them quite well. They were men of\r\nculture and education, landowners who sent their crops--mainly wheat,\r\noats, clover and clover seed--and those of their neighbors to the\r\nmarkets of Kaiserslautern and Mannheim, the chief commercial towns of\r\nthe section. They spoke German and French fluently, and had also, of\r\ncourse, been thoroughly educated in the Hebrew language and literature.\r\n\r\nThe name of Straus was well known among the Jews of Bavaria, and both my\r\ngreat-grandfather and my father contributed to its prominence. During\r\n1806 a spirit of reaction, political and religious, swept over France,\r\nmaking itself especially troublesome in Alsace and in the German\r\ndepartments of the upper and lower Rhine. Exceptionable and restrictive\r\nlaws were advocated to deprive the Jews there of rights they were\r\nenjoying throughout France. As had happened often before, and not\r\nunknown since, the reactionaries fanned the hatred against Jews, making\r\nthem the scapegoats in their campaign against the advancing spirit of\r\nliberalism. Thus the cause of the Jews was linked with the cause of\r\nliberty itself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOTHER AND FATHER OF OSCAR S. STRAUS]\r\n\r\nNapoleon himself was at first prejudiced against the Jews, regarding\r\nthem as usurers and extortioners. He soon realized, however, that the\r\ncharacteristics which confronted him could not be imputed to Judaism,\r\nbut were due rather to the restricted civil and industrial rights of the\r\nJews and to their general unhappy condition. It was made manifest to him\r\nthat in Bordeaux, Marseilles, and the Italian cities of France, as\r\nwell as in Holland, some of the most useful and patriotic citizens were\r\nJews. Napoleon always had an eye on his historical reputation, and\r\ndesiring to do nothing that would obscure his fame, he decided to\r\nconvene a council of representative Jews from the various provinces.\r\nAccordingly, on May 30, 1806, he issued his decree, famous in the annals\r\nof the Jews in modern times, summoning the Assembly of Notables of the\r\nJewish nation to meet in Paris the following July. The prefects in the\r\nvarious provinces were required to aid in the selection of the most\r\ndistinguished men from among the rabbis and the laity.\r\n\r\nThe deputies came to Paris from all parts of the French Empire. They\r\nnumbered one hundred and eleven in all, and spoke French, German, and\r\nItalian. Many of them were themselves well known, others achieved a\r\nposthumous glamour in the deeds of descendants who have since won\r\ndistinction in European history and in the annals of Jewry. There were\r\nJoseph Sinzheim, first rabbi of Strasbourg, foremost Talmudist and\r\nconsidered the most scholarly member of the Assembly, who was made\r\npresident of the Assembly and later chairman of the Great Sanhedrin;\r\nMichel Berr, afterwards the first French Jew to practice at the bar;\r\nAbraham Furtado, son of a marano or crypto-Jewish Portuguese family from\r\nwhich was also descended the wife of the first Benjamin D'Israeli and\r\nSir John Simon; Isaac Samuel d'Avigdor of Nice, grandfather of Jules\r\nd'Avigdor who was a member of the Piedmont Parliament; Israel\r\nOttolenghi, an ancestor of Italy's late Minister of War; Abraham de\r\nCologna, rabbi of Mantua, a great political leader and reformer; and\r\nmany others of equal rank and caliber. Their task was a monumental one,\r\nfor it was nothing less than to justify Judaism and Jewry to the world;\r\nand they assembled with a full consciousness of their responsibility.\r\n\r\nAt this Assembly my great-grandfather represented the Department of Mont\r\nTennerre. He evidently played an important part in the diplomacy which\r\nthis unprecedented council involved, for he was a member of the\r\nsub-committee of fifteen delegated to meet the commissioners appointed\r\nby Napoleon, also a member of the committee to which the Assembly gave\r\nthe delicate work of preparing the groundwork for discussion with the\r\ncommissioners. Subsequently he was appointed to the committee of nine of\r\nthe Great Sanhedrin which the following year presented to Napoleon's\r\ncommittee the conclusions formulated and agreed upon by the Assembly,\r\nand which helped to bring about their adoption.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy father, in turn, was active in the revolutionary movement in 1848.\r\nThis was an heroic effort on the part of the liberal forces of Europe to\r\nachieve constitutional government, and when it failed many of those who\r\nhad borne a conspicuous part fled to other countries. Thus it was that\r\nGenerals Sigel, Schurz, Stahl, and others, who later were prominent in\r\nour Civil War, came to America. These men and their immediate followers\r\nconstitute one of the most valuable groups of immigrants that have come\r\nto these shores since our government was organized. In the land of their\r\nbirth they had already made sacrifices for constitutionalism and\r\ndemocracy, and basically they had made them for American principles.\r\nThey were Americans in spirit, therefore, even before they arrived.\r\n\r\nHaving been active only locally in the revolutionary movement, my father\r\nwas not prosecuted. He was made aware, however, of the suspicions of the\r\nauthorities and was subjected to all those petty annoyances and\r\ndiscriminations which a reactionary government never fails to lay upon\r\npeople who have revolted, and revolted in vain. My father decided, in\r\nconsequence, to emigrate. This purpose he did not carry into effect\r\nuntil the spring of 1852. He had many ties, which it was difficult to\r\nbreak at once. He had been in comfortable circumstances, like his father\r\nand grandfather a landowner and dealer on a large scale in farm\r\nproducts, principally grains. The revolution left him reduced in\r\ncircumstances and even to some extent in debt. He had four children, of\r\nwhom I was the youngest, being then less than a year and a half old.\r\nTherefore, like the prudent man he was, he waited, and then came to\r\nAmerica alone with the purpose of establishing himself in some small way\r\nbefore allowing his family to exchange the comparative security of their\r\nfamiliar surroundings for the insecurity of an unknown land.\r\n\r\nHe landed at Philadelphia, where he met a number of former acquaintances\r\nwho had preceded him to America, some of whom were already established\r\nin business. They advised him to go South. Acting on this suggestion he\r\nwent on to Oglethorpe, Georgia, where he met some more acquaintances\r\nfrom the old country. Through them he made a connection with two\r\nbrothers Kaufman, who plied the peddler's trade. They owned a peddler's\r\nwagon with which they dispensed through the several counties of the\r\nState an assortment of dry goods and what was known as \"Yankee notions.\"\r\n\r\nFor my father this was indeed a pioneer business in a pioneer country,\r\nyet it was not like the peddling of to-day. In the fifties the\r\npopulation of the whole State of Georgia was only about nine hundred\r\nthousand. Because of the existence of slavery there were on the large\r\nplantations often more colored people than there were whites living in\r\nthe near-by villages. The itinerant merchant, therefore, filled a real\r\nwant, and his vocation was looked upon as quite dignified. Indeed, he\r\nwas treated by the owners of the plantations with a spirit of equality\r\nthat it is hard to appreciate to-day. Then, too, the existence of\r\nslavery drew a distinct line of demarcation between the white and black\r\nraces. This gave to the white visitor a status of equality that probably\r\notherwise he would not have enjoyed to such a degree.\r\n\r\nProvided only, therefore, that the peddler proved himself an honorable,\r\nupright man, who conscientiously treated his customers with fairness and\r\nmade no misrepresentations regarding his wares, he was treated as an\r\nhonored guest by the plantation owners--certainly a spirit of true\r\ndemocracy. The visits were made periodically and were quite looked\r\nforward to by the plantation owners. The peddler usually stayed one\r\nnight at the house of his customer and took his meals with the family.\r\nAnother ideally democratic feature about these sojourns was that spirit\r\nof Southern hospitality which, even in the relationship between the\r\nwealthiest, most aristocratic family and the humble peddler, permitted\r\nno pay for board and lodging, and only a small charge for feed for the\r\nhorses. The peddler in turn usually made a gift to either the lady or\r\nher daughter. Often he provided himself with articles for this purpose,\r\nbut usually on one visit he would find out what might be welcome and on\r\nthe next visit bring it. The bonds of friendship thus made are, I\r\nventure to say, hardly understandable in our day.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the course of these wanderings my father came to Talbotton, a town of\r\nsome eight or nine hundred inhabitants, the county seat of Talbot\r\nCounty, and about forty miles east of the Alabama boundary. Talbotton\r\nimmediately impressed him so favorably that he selected it as the next\r\nhome for his family. It had an air of refinement that pleased him; there\r\nwere gardens with nicely cultivated flowers and shrubbery, and houses\r\nthat were neat, well kept, and properly painted. Upon inquiry he found\r\nfurther that there were splendid schools for both boys and girls.\r\n\r\nThere was another factor which doubtless caused father to be favorably\r\nimpressed with Talbotton; it was court week when he arrived, at which\r\ntime a town has a more or less festive appearance and is at its best so\r\nfar as activity is concerned. Then there was a third factor that\r\ninfluenced him to settle there. Before doing business in any county,\r\npeddlers were required to go to the county seat to buy a license. At\r\nTalbotton this license was very high, and my father doubted that his\r\nbusiness in Talbot County would warrant the expense. The idea occurred\r\nto him to utilize the presence of the many strangers in town to test the\r\npossibilities of the place by unpacking and displaying his goods in a\r\nstore. An interview with Captain Curley, the only tailor in the town,\r\ndeveloped the fact that the store he occupied was too large for his\r\nneeds and he would be willing to share it with my father. So this\r\narrangement was promptly made, and at a cost less than the expense of\r\nthe county license for itinerant merchandising.\r\n\r\nThe experiment proved most satisfactory. In a few weeks the stock was so\r\ndepleted that my father proposed to his partner that they rent a store\r\nand settle in Talbotton. This they did. My father then prepared to go to\r\nPhiladelphia to get a stock of goods. His partner counseled against\r\nthis. There was a merchant in Oglethorpe who, up to this point, had\r\nsupplied them with all their merchandise; they would need to refer to\r\nhim for credit, and they were still indebted to him for the stock in\r\nhand; also, he would probably not approve of their settling down in a\r\nstore instead of peddling. The new store offered large display space in\r\ncomparison with the wagon, and the partner doubted my father's ability\r\nto get enough credit in Philadelphia to make a proper display. Still\r\nanother obstacle. The line of merchandise that was to constitute most of\r\ntheir stock was what was then known as dry goods and domestics. This\r\nbusiness was entirely in the hands of the Yankees and the most difficult\r\none in which to gain a foothold, especially for a German immigrant\r\nwithout capital.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the end my father did go to Philadelphia. He had found\r\nseveral acquaintances in that city, as I have already said, who had been\r\nresident in his neighborhood in the old country. These people were\r\nestablished in several of the wholesale houses in the different lines of\r\nmerchandise he required, except the dry goods. And solely on the\r\nstrength of his character and the reputation he had had in Europe he was\r\nable to establish with them the necessary credit, which neither his\r\ncapital nor his business experience in a new field and a strange country\r\nwarranted. In fact, their faith in him was so strong that one of them\r\ngladly introduced him to the wholesale dry goods merchants, and he was\r\nable to accomplish the full purpose of his mission, to the great\r\namazement of his partner.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BIRTHPLACE OF OSCAR S. STRAUS OTTERBERG, RHENISH BAVARIA]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHAPEL AND SCHOOLHOUSE COLLINSWORTH INSTITUTE, TALBOTTON,\r\nGEORGIA]\r\n\r\nThat was in 1853, and marked the beginning of my family's history in\r\nthis country. This bit of success encouraged my father to write home\r\nthat he might be able to have us join him the following year.\r\nAccordingly, on August 24, 1854, our little party left Otterberg. It\r\nwas a journey that required no little courage and resourcefulness. My\r\nmother had three years before suffered a paralytic stroke, and of her\r\nfour children the eldest, my brother Isidor, was only nine years old. My\r\nsister Hermina was a year and a half younger, Nathan was six, and I was\r\nonly three and a half. My mother's father accompanied us from Otterberg\r\nto Kaiserslautern, he on horseback and the rest of us with our nursemaid\r\nin a carriage; we then took the train to Forbach, a French frontier\r\ntown, where we remained overnight. The next morning we left for Paris.\r\nThere we stayed until August 29th, when we started for Havre to board\r\nthe steamer St. Louis on her maiden voyage. As our boat was being docked\r\nin New York on September 12th, my mother recognized my father\r\nenergetically pacing the wharf. Minutes seemed like hours.\r\n\r\nWe did not go directly to Talbotton. Yellow fever was raging in\r\nSavannah, and as we had to go through that port _en route_ to Talbotton,\r\nwe waited in Philadelphia for a few weeks, until the danger was\r\nconsidered over. Even then we avoided entering the city until it was\r\ntime to board the train for Geneva, where we were to take the\r\nstage-coach for the remaining seven miles to Talbotton. The boat docked\r\nat Savannah in the morning, and we spent the day until evening in the\r\nsmall shanty that was called the station. When finally we reached\r\nTalbotton we found a very comfortable home ready for us. My precocious\r\nbrother Isidor immediately inspected the whole and thought it odd to be\r\nin a house built on stilts, as he called it. The house, typical of that\r\nlocality, had no cellar, but was supported by an open foundation of\r\nwooden pillars about twenty-five feet apart.\r\n\r\nOur family was received with kindness and hospitality, so that in a\r\nvery few years our parents were made to feel much at home. My mother,\r\nwho had considerable experience in the cultivation of flowers and\r\nvegetables, soon had a garden which was very helpful and instructive to\r\nher circle of neighbors and friends. My father, always a student and\r\nwell versed in biblical literature and the Bible, which he read in the\r\noriginal, was much sought by the ministers of the various denominations,\r\nseveral of whom habitually dined at our house when in Talbotton on their\r\ncircuit. At such times the discussion usually ran along theological\r\nlines. One of my earliest recollections is hearing my father take\r\npassages from the Old Testament and translate them literally for the\r\ninformation of these ministers.\r\n\r\nWe were the only Jewish family in the town. This at first aroused some\r\ncuriosity among those who had never met persons of our race or religion\r\nbefore. I remember hearing some one doubt that we were Jews and\r\nremarking to my father, who had very blond hair and blue eyes, that he\r\nthought all Jews had black hair and dark complexion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy brother Isidor and my sister were immediately sent to school, and my\r\nsecond brother and I were sent as soon as we arrived at school age. I\r\nwas seven years old when I began learning my letters.\r\n\r\nMy main religious instruction came from conversations with my father and\r\nfrom the discussions the ministers of various denominations had with\r\nhim, which I always followed with great interest. When my brother Nathan\r\nand I were respectively about eleven and eight and a half years old, we\r\nwere sent to the Baptist Sunday school upon the persuasion of the\r\nBaptist minister, who had become an intimate friend of my father's.\r\nThere we heard the Bible read and were taught principally from the Old\r\nTestament. Our teacher was a gunsmith who had more piety than knowledge,\r\nand what he lacked in erudition he made up by good intentions which,\r\nafter all, had a cultural value. We continued our attendance some two\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nAt eleven I entered Collinsworth Institute, a higher school for boys,\r\nabout a mile outside of Talbotton. Isidor had been there, and Nathan was\r\nthere then. It was not a large school, though it was the best of its\r\nkind in our vicinity. The recitation hall or chapel was a little frame\r\nbuilding standing in a square, and around that were eight or ten\r\none-story frame houses where boys coming from a distance lived. The\r\npupils ranged in age from about ten to eighteen, and there were three\r\nteachers. We were taught the three R's, and the advanced pupils studied\r\nthe classics.\r\n\r\nIn our small town, being the county seat, we had gala days each month\r\nwhen the court convened and people came from the surrounding districts\r\nas for a holiday. There was much drinking of gin and whiskey by the\r\nyoung country squires, which frequently ended up in some fighting where\r\npistols and knives were freely used. This all left a deep impression on\r\nmy young mind and made me a prohibitionist long before I knew the\r\nmeaning of the word. In the North when boys got to fighting they used\r\ntheir fists; in the South they used, besides their fists, sticks and\r\nstones, and consequently it was a more serious and dangerous affair. If\r\nin the North one boy cursed another or called him a liar, it would not\r\nnecessarily lead to a fist fight; in fact, it usually stopped at\r\nrecrimination. In the South that kind of quarreling meant a serious\r\nfight. I think because of these facts the Southern boys were much more\r\nguarded and polite to each other in speech than was customary among\r\nNorthern boys. Perhaps much of the so-called Southern politeness had\r\nits roots in the use, in boyhood, of milder terms in case of\r\ndisagreement. I recall one fight between two of the leading men of\r\nTalbotton, both deacons in the same church. One took out his pocket\r\nknife and cut the other's throat, and he died. After considerable delay\r\nthe murderer was tried, but because of his high standing in the\r\ncommunity he was acquitted, doubtless on the plea of self-defense, and\r\nhe got off scot-free.\r\n\r\nAs a boy brought up in the South I never questioned the rights or wrongs\r\nof slavery. Its existence I regarded as matter of course, as most other\r\ncustoms or institutions. The grown people of the South, whatever they\r\nthought about it, would not, except in rare instances, speak against it;\r\nand even then in the most private and guarded manner. To do otherwise\r\nwould subject one to social ostracism. We heard it defended in the\r\npulpit and justified on biblical grounds by leading ministers. With my\r\nfather it was different. I frequently heard him discuss the subject with\r\nthe ministers who came to our house, and he would point out to them that\r\nthe Bible must be read with discrimination and in relation to the period\r\nto which the chapters refer; and it must not be forgotten that it is the\r\nhistory of a people covering more than a thousand years; and that even\r\nthen there had been no such thing as perpetual bondage, as all slaves\r\nwere declared free in the year of jubilee.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OSCAR S. STRAUS AT SIX]\r\n\r\nLooking backward and making comparisons between my observations as a boy\r\nin the South and later in the North, I find there was much more freedom\r\nof expression in the North than in the South. Few people in the South\r\nwould venture to express themselves against the current of dominant\r\nopinion upon matters of sectional importance. The institution of slavery\r\nwith all that it implied seemed to have had the effect of enslaving,\r\nor, to use a milder term, checking, freedom of expression on the part of\r\nthe master class only in lesser degree than among the slaves themselves.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn our town, as in all Southern communities, the better families were\r\nkind, especially to their household slaves, whom they regarded as\r\nmembers of the family requiring guardianship and protection, in a degree\r\nas if they were children. And the slaves addressed their masters by\r\ntheir first names and their mistresses as \"miss.\" My mother, for\r\ninstance, was \"Miss Sara.\" I recall one of our servants pleading with my\r\nmother: \"Miss Sara, won't you buy me, I want to stay here. I love you\r\nand the white folks here, and I am afraid my master will hire me out or\r\nsell me to some one else.\" At that time we hired our servants from their\r\nmasters, whom we paid an agreed price. But as the result of such\r\nconstant pleadings my father purchased household slaves one by one from\r\ntheir masters, although neither he nor my mother believed in slavery. If\r\nwe children spoke to the slaves harshly or disregarded their feelings,\r\nwe were promptly checked and reprimanded by our parents. My father also\r\nsaw to it that our two men servants learned a trade; the one learned\r\ntailoring and the other how to make shoes, though it was regarded\r\ndisloyal, at any rate looked upon with suspicion, if a master permitted\r\na slave boy or girl to be taught even reading and writing. When later we\r\ncame North we took with us the two youngest servants, one a boy about my\r\nage, and the other a girl a little older. They were too young to look\r\nout for themselves, and so far as they knew they had no relatives. We\r\nkept them with us until they grew up and could look out for themselves.\r\n\r\nThe people throughout the South, with the exception of the richer\r\nplantation owners, lived simply. In our household, for instance, we\r\nalways lived well, but economically. My mother was very systematic and\r\nfrugal. She had an allowance of twenty dollars a month, and my brother\r\nIsidor has well said that she would have managed to save something even\r\nif it had been smaller. It was her pleasure to be her own financier, and\r\nsmall as her allowance sounds now, she was able in the course of two or\r\nthree years to save enough to buy a piano for my sister. This she felt\r\nto be an expense with which my father's exchequer should not be taxed.\r\n\r\nWe raised our own vegetables and chickens. Fresh meat, except pork,\r\nmight have been termed a luxury. Many of the families had their own\r\nsmokehouses, as we did, which were filled once a year, at the\r\nhog-killing season. There was no such thing as a butcher in our little\r\ntown. When a farmer in the country round wanted to slaughter an ox or a\r\nsheep, he would do so and bring it to town, exhibit it in the public\r\nsquare in a shanty called the market (used for that particular occasion\r\nand at other times empty), toll the bell that was there, and in that way\r\nannounce that some fresh meat was on sale. This procedure never occurred\r\noftener than once in two or three weeks during the cold weather.\r\n\r\nIce was another luxury in that community. It had to be shipped many\r\nmiles and was therefore brought in only occasionally, mainly for a\r\nconfectioner who at times offered ice cream to the people.\r\n\r\nThere was no gas lighting. Oil lamps were used, but to a larger extent\r\ncandles, which were manufactured in each household, of fat and bees'\r\nwax. In that process we children all helped.\r\n\r\nIndeed, with a small business in a small town in those days it was\r\npossible for a man to accumulate a surplus only through the practice of\r\nthe strictest economy by his family as well as by himself, an economy\r\nalmost bordering parsimony. There were no public or free schools in that\r\npart of the South; every textbook had to be bought and tuition paid for;\r\nand there were four of us.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen the war broke out new economies were called for. A simple life has\r\nits advantages; it is conducive to self-help, also to the ability to do\r\nwithout things and meet emergencies without unhappiness. My father's\r\npartner joined the Fourth Georgia Regiment, and my brother Isidor, then\r\nsixteen, was withdrawn from Collinsworth Institute to take up work with\r\nmy father. He had gained some experience in carrying on the business by\r\nhelping father evenings, for our store was open until nine-thirty. It\r\nwas closed during the supper hour, but reopened thereafter.\r\n\r\nIn that part of the country coffee became unobtainable except when now\r\nand then a few bags arrived on a ship that had run the blockade. Our\r\nmothers learned to give us an acceptable substitute by cutting sweet\r\npotatoes into little cubes, drying them in the sun, then roasting and\r\ngrinding them, together with grains of wheat, like the ordinary bean.\r\nThis made a hot and palatable drink having the color of coffee without\r\nthe harmful stimulus of its caffeine.\r\n\r\nSalt also became scarce. It was difficult and at times impossible to\r\nobtain enough to cure our pork. Some one discovered that the earthen\r\nfloors of the smokehouses were impregnated with considerable salt from\r\nprevious curings, so a method was invented for recovering it from that\r\nsource.\r\n\r\nIn the later years of the war, when railway transportation was very poor\r\nand in many localities interrupted, we did not suffer for food, because,\r\nas I have said, most households in the small towns and in the country\r\nraised the major part of their food supplies; they had their own\r\nchickens, eggs, milk, butter, garden provisions. Children of my age\r\nlived largely on corn bread and molasses, of which there was an\r\never-plentiful amount.\r\n\r\nDuring the second year of the war my father's partner was discharged\r\nfrom his regiment for physical disability. My father, always insistent\r\nupon the best possible education for us all, therefore urged my brother\r\nIsidor to continue his studies. Most of the high schools and colleges,\r\nhowever, had been suspended because the teachers, as well as many of the\r\nsenior scholars, had joined the army. On the other hand, the war had\r\nfired the whole South with the military spirit, and as was natural for a\r\nyoung man barely seventeen, my brother chose to attend the Georgia\r\nMilitary Academy at Marietta, which was running full blast. Earlier in\r\nthe war, when the Fourth Georgia Regiment, taking practically all the\r\nable-bodied men of the town, had left for the front, the boys of\r\nTalbotton organized a company of which Isidor was elected first\r\nlieutenant. They had offered their services to the governor of the\r\nState, but he replied that there were not enough arms to equip all the\r\nmen, so that equipping boys was out of the question. All these incidents\r\nhad influenced my brother in his choice, and he left quite\r\nenthusiastically for the Georgia Military Academy to take his entrance\r\nexaminations. When he returned, however, his mood was much different.\r\nUpon his arrival at Marietta he had about an hour's waiting before he\r\ncould see the proper person. Some acquaintances whom he met on the\r\ncampus invited him to visit their living quarters meanwhile. As he\r\nentered one of the rooms the door stood ajar. Without noticing this he\r\ngave the door a push, resulting in his being drenched to the skin by a\r\nbucket of water that had been balanced over the door and held there by\r\nthe position of the door when ajar. He had to return to the hotel to\r\nchange his entire apparel. He had not heard of hazing before, and the\r\nincident disgusted him so that he never returned to the academy. He\r\nembarked upon his career as a merchant the very next morning.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1863 our family moved to Columbus, Georgia. It was a much larger\r\nplace than Talbotton, having a population of about twelve thousand,\r\noffered more opportunities, and, too, my brother Isidor had already\r\nfound employment there. With its broad main street and brick residences\r\nit looked like a great city to me.\r\n\r\nAs in Talbotton, there were no public schools in Columbus, so I was sent\r\nto a private school kept by an Irish master named Flynn, who did not act\r\non the pedagogical principle, \"Spare the rod and spoil the child.\" By\r\nhim I was taught the three R's and began Latin. I also experienced my\r\nfirst stage-fright at Master Flynn's, when my turn came to speak a piece\r\nbefore the entire school. In all Southern schools much emphasis was\r\nplaced upon elocution. I well remember practicing before a mirror and\r\nreciting under the trees in stentorian voice with dramatic gesture the\r\ngreat oration put into John Adams's mouth by Daniel Webster, beginning:\r\n\"Sink or swim, live or die, survive or perish, I give my hand and my\r\nheart to this vote.\"\r\n\r\nAfter another year this school was discontinued and I was sent to one\r\nkept by a Dr. Dews. He was a teacher trained in the classics and far\r\nless severe than Flynn, more sympathetic and cultured. Under him I\r\nbegan Virgil and afterwards Horace. It was not customary to teach\r\nEnglish grammar; we derived that from our laborious drilling in Latin\r\ngrammar.\r\n\r\nThere were no public libraries, and few families, other than those of\r\nprofessional men, had many books. The standard assortment consisted of\r\nthe Bible, Josephus, Burns; some had Shakespeare's works. I do not\r\nrecall at this period reading any book outside of those we had for study\r\nat school. Boys of my age led an outdoor life, indulging in seasonable\r\nsports which rotated from top-spinning to marbles, to ball-playing,\r\nprincipally a game called town-ball. We all had shot-guns, so that in\r\nseason and out we went bird-hunting and rabbit-hunting.\r\n\r\nWe went barefooted nine months of the year, both for comfort and\r\neconomy. As in Talbotton we lived most economically. We were not poor in\r\nthe sense of being needy; we never felt in any way dependent. Our home\r\nwas comfortable, wholesome, full of sunshine and good cheer, and always\r\nhospitable to friends. Our wants were few and simple, so we had plenty,\r\nand I felt as independent as any child of the rich.\r\n\r\nWe were now in the midst of the Civil War, and money, measured in gold,\r\nwas worth about five cents per dollar. My brother Nathan seemed to be\r\naffected by this into constant scheming for making pocket money. He was\r\nfifteen years old, and out of school hours helped father in the store;\r\nbut he seemed to be in need of more pin-money. He finally hit on a plan\r\nthat proved quite lucrative. He collected or bought up pieces of hemp\r\nrope and sold them to a manufacturer. Hemp was very scarce and much\r\nneeded. With the proceeds he bought a beautiful bay pony, which he and I\r\nprized more than any possession we have ever had, before or since.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of April, 1865, after a feeble skirmish on the part of the\r\ncitizen soldiers, mainly superannuated men and schoolboys, Columbus was\r\ncaptured by General James H. Wilson at the head of a cavalry corps of\r\nfifteen thousand men. The war had practically ended seven days before,\r\nas Lee surrendered on the 9th at Appomattox Court House in Virginia; but\r\nas telegraph and railroad communication had been disrupted, this fact\r\nwas not yet known in our part of Georgia. As soon as Wilson's army took\r\npossession of our debilitated city general confusion reigned. Looting\r\nbegan by the town rabble, led by several drunken Federal soldiers;\r\ncotton warehouses were burned, the contents of which represented the\r\nsavings of many, including most of my father's; all horses were seized,\r\nand among them our little pony, which I never saw again, though I still\r\nretain a vivid picture of him in my mind's eye. Frequently since, when I\r\nhave met that fine and accomplished old veteran, General Wilson, who is\r\nstill among the living, hale and hearty, I have jestingly reproached him\r\nfor taking from me the most treasured possession I ever had.\r\n\r\nThis incident and others served to give me a most vivid impression of\r\nthe closing years of the Civil War. Another very vivid impression that\r\noccurred shortly before the beginning of the war clings to my memory.\r\nRobert Toombs, one of Georgia's most conspicuous United States Senators,\r\nwas making a speech at the Masonic Temple in Columbus, Georgia. It was a\r\nhot summer day. Toombs was a short, thick, heavy-set man of the\r\nWebsterian type, and one of the South's most picturesque orators. After\r\nthe election of Lincoln, however, Toombs advocated secession and\r\nresigned from the Senate, was talked of for the Confederate presidency,\r\ndid become Confederate Secretary of State, and was later commissioned a\r\nbrigadier-general, and commanded with distinction in numerous battles of\r\nthe Civil War. During the speech I heard him make, he drew a large white\r\nhandkerchief from his pocket with a flourish, and pausing before mopping\r\nhis perspiring forehead, he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"The Yankees will not and can not fight! I will guarantee to wipe up\r\nwith this handkerchief every drop of blood that is spilt.\"\r\n\r\nNeither he nor the audience foresaw what was coming. The Civil War was a\r\nfamily affair, yet the hostility it engendered and the misconception it\r\nbrought in its train regarding the valor, and even the standards of\r\ncivilization, of the enemy, were as extreme and virulent as in a war\r\nbetween nations of different continents and races. Such are the\r\nbrutalizing passions war arouses in banishing from the individual mind\r\nthe most elementary ideas of brotherhood.\r\n\r\nWhen the war ended my father had to begin life anew, and because of the\r\ndiscouraging prospects and conditions of the South he decided to move\r\nNorth. In the North, too, he could more readily dispose of the remainder\r\nof his cotton, his chief asset, to pay off debts which he owed in New\r\nYork and Philadelphia for goods purchased before the war. With the few\r\nthousand dollars remaining after paying these debts, and with good\r\ncredit, he thought he could begin some new business in a small way.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with our arrival in Philadelphia my brother Isidor\r\narrived in New York from Europe, where he had gone two years before as\r\nsecretary of a commission to buy supplies for the State of Georgia. The\r\nblockade of the Southern ports became so effective that ships could not\r\nget through, so that he did not succeed in getting over the supplies;\r\nbut he made several thousand dollars in the sale of Confederate bonds.\r\nUpon learning in New York that we were in Philadelphia, he immediately\r\ncame there to find out my father's plans. He persuaded father that New\r\nYork, as the chief market, was preferable to Philadelphia as a secondary\r\none. Consequently we moved to New York, and father and Isidor, together\r\nwith Nathan, planned to establish themselves in the wholesale crockery\r\nbusiness. Isidor, twenty years old, first used part of his fortune to\r\nbuy for my mother a high-stoop, three-story brick house at 220 West\r\nForty-Ninth Street, now long since torn down, but which we occupied for\r\nover eighteen years.\r\n\r\nIt was fully six months before the new business venture was launched. My\r\nfather depended for his part of the capital upon the sale of the\r\nremainder of his cotton, which had been shipped to Liverpool, and this\r\nwas not effected until early in 1866. In the intervening months he\r\nvisited his creditors in New York to arrange for paying his debts. In\r\nthis connection I remember one significant incident: His principal New\r\nYork creditor was the dry goods house of George Bliss & Co., to whom he\r\nowed an amount between four and five thousand dollars. (Bliss afterward\r\nbecame a member of the banking firm of Morton, Bliss & Co.) When he\r\ncalled regarding the payment of this, Mr. Bliss asked how old he was,\r\nwhat family he had, and what he intended doing. My father answered that\r\nhe was fifty-seven, that he had a wife and four children, and that he\r\nhoped to make a new start in the wholesale crockery business. \"I don't\r\nthink you are fair to your family and yourself,\" said Mr. Bliss, \"to\r\ndeprive yourself of the slender means you tell me you possess by paying\r\nout your available resources. I will compromise with you for less than\r\nthe full amount in view of the hardships of the war and your family\r\nobligations.\"\r\n\r\nMy father had a very high sense of honor and was always more concerned\r\nin maintaining it beyond possible reproach than in making money. Some\r\nparents forget that they cannot successfully live by one standard\r\noutside and another inside the home, and many never realize that\r\nchildren are influenced not so much by the preaching as by the true and\r\nreal spirit of their parents. My father believed that \"a good name is\r\nbetter than riches,\" and within the home or without he lived up to that\r\nstandard. I clearly remember the impression I received of his integrity\r\nat the time of this Bliss incident, and of a certain feeling of\r\ncompunction on the part of his creditor, as though he had expected\r\nsomething different. Most Southern merchants regarded themselves morally\r\nfreed from paying Northern creditors because the Confederate government\r\nhad confiscated such debts and compelled the debtors to pay the amounts\r\nto the government. But my father held true to his standard, and I well\r\nremember his parting words to Bliss that day: \"I propose to pay my debts\r\nin full and leave to my children a good name even if I should leave them\r\nnothing else.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy brother Isidor, always my guide, philosopher, and friend, now\r\narranged for my schooling. In my geography textbook was a picture of\r\nColumbia College, and I had the fixed idea that when we came to New York\r\nI wanted to go there. On inquiry we learned that I was too young, for I\r\nwas only fourteen and a half, and that I had not the requirements for\r\nadmission. So in the autumn of 1865 Isidor had me enter Columbia Grammar\r\nSchool, then one of the best schools in the city. It was my first\r\nexperience in a really first-rate school, and the teaching was so much\r\nmore thorough and exact than my previous training had been that it\r\nseemed to me I had to learn everything anew. The tuition fee and the\r\ncost of books was considerable, in view of the modest income of the\r\nfamily; but my father, economical in all other respects, was liberal\r\nbeyond his means where the education of his children was concerned. My\r\nbrother, moreover, was desirous that I should have the advantages of the\r\ncollege training which circumstances, notably the war, had withheld from\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nI appreciated to the full the privileges I was permitted to enjoy and\r\nstudied with all my might. The school regulations required that parents\r\nfill out a blank each week stating, among other things, the number of\r\nhours we studied at home. The average number of hours daily reported\r\nwere three or four, and as my record was fully double that, I felt\r\nrather ashamed to give the true number, so I always gave less. The\r\nschool was on Fourth Avenue and Twenty-Seventh Street, and our home on\r\nForty-Ninth Street was near Eighth Avenue. I invariably walked both\r\nways, saving car fares and at the same time conserving my health, for\r\naside from a half-hour of gymnastics twice a week in school I had\r\nneither time nor opportunity otherwise to get the exercise my body\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nOwing to the careless preparation I had received at the schools in the\r\nSouth, I made a poor showing in spite of my hard work now, though on one\r\noccasion I shone with accidental glory. It was the custom for the\r\ninstructor to put the same question to pupil after pupil, and to elevate\r\nthe one who gave the correct answer to the head of the class. In this\r\ninstance, it so happened that I gave the fortunate answer and thus\r\nqualified for the seat of scholastic eminence. As I sat there enjoying a\r\nnear view of the teacher's countenance, I wondered how long I should\r\nremain thus distinguished, and was unable to resist the impulse to cast\r\nan occasional backward glance at the rows of seats in the rear.\r\n\r\nAt about this time, an elderly gentleman of distinguished appearance\r\nentered the classroom. He was S. F. B. Morse, inventor of the telegraph.\r\nMorse, whose grandson was in my class, knowing the custom and observing\r\nme in the seat of honor, complimented me. He observed that I, like\r\nhimself, had a large head in comparison with the body, and remarked that\r\nI must be a bright boy. But I felt embarrassed rather than gratified at\r\nthe praise, for I knew, and so did the rest, that I did not deserve it.\r\nI still recall that scene, and see the venerable old man, then\r\nseventy-five years old, with the long white beard that made him look\r\neven older.\r\n\r\nWhen the time came, in the spring of 1867, for our class to go up for\r\ncollege examination, the Rev. Dr. Bacon, successor as principal of the\r\nschool to Charles Anthon, the distinguished classical scholar and editor\r\nof classical works, called the boys of our class before him and gave us\r\neach a blessing with some encouraging words. When my turn came he was\r\nvery kind, telling me he knew I had tried hard, but because of my early\r\ntraining, or lack of it, he feared I might not pass. I saw my chances of\r\na college education go glimmering. There were, however, still two weeks\r\nbefore the examinations, and I determined to use those for all they were\r\nworth. I worked night and day, cramming with a vengeance. I felt I could\r\nnot expect my father to keep me in school another year when after two\r\nyears of preparation I had shown myself so deficient. That thought was\r\nmy spur, though in point of fact I am sure both my brother Isidor and my\r\nfather, realizing I had done the best I could, would have insisted upon\r\nmy taking another year for preparation.\r\n\r\nThe result of my entrance examinations was more favorable than I could\r\nhave hoped. It turned out that I was the only one from our grammar\r\nschool class to pass in all subjects without a single condition. It was\r\nluck rather than brilliancy. The professor who examined my classmates in\r\nancient geography, being the author of the book upon which the\r\nexamination was held, was so meticulous that unless the student gave the\r\nanswer exactly as in the book he was marked deficient. By the time it\r\ncame my turn to be examined another and more generous-minded professor\r\nhad taken his place and passed me with the highest mark. The others, who\r\nhad all flunked, regarded me, in their own language, as \"the lucky dog.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy college course began on October 7, 1867. Here I did not find the\r\nstudies hard. I had ample leisure for reading and took full advantage of\r\nthe college library, from which we were free to select and take home\r\nwhatever books we desired. Then, as now, I cared little for fiction. To\r\nme the literature of facts was more interesting and therefore lighter\r\nreading, and I read much biography and history.\r\n\r\nOur class matriculated fifty-two, but dwindled down to thirty-one by\r\ngraduation. In the class were Brander Matthews, now professor of\r\nliterature at Columbia as well as literary and dramatic critic; Robert\r\nFulton Cutting, financier and ideal citizen, descendant of an old and\r\nfamous New York family, as his name indicates; Stuyvesant Fish, banker,\r\nalso of a well-known New York family, whose father, Hamilton Fish, was\r\nSecretary of State in the Grant Cabinet, and whose grandfather and\r\nfather both were among Columbia alumni; and Henry Van Rensselaer, who\r\nbecame a Jesuit father and is now no longer among the living.\r\n\r\nAt the commemoration of the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nfounding of the college three of us--Robert Fulton Cutting, Brander\r\nMatthews, and myself--received the honorary degree of LL.D. At this\r\nwriting, fifty years after graduation, there are but ten of us\r\nremaining.\r\n\r\nThe most coveted honors in those days were to be had for literary\r\nachievement and class rank. Among the few prizes was one known as the\r\nAlumni Prize, awarded to the most deserving student in the graduating\r\nclass. The college board nominated for that honor William Henry Sage,\r\nnow our class historian, Joseph Fenelon Vermilye, and myself; and the\r\nclass elected Vermilye for the prize.\r\n\r\nAthletics had not attained the vogue it has in American universities\r\nto-day, and was particularly absent in our college, confined then to a\r\ncity block. Doubtless due to this lack the boys of our class, on the\r\nwhole a spirited and boisterous lot, found self-expression in a\r\ndisregard for proper decorum in the lecture rooms. There was one period\r\nwhere this was conspicuously the case. The subject was Evidences of\r\nChristianity. It was compulsory and along denominational lines. It did\r\nnot interest many of the boys, and some of those who were not\r\nEpiscopalians even resented it; to boot, the professor, Rev. Dr.\r\nMcVickar, was a mild-mannered man, entirely unable to maintain\r\ndiscipline. The result was frequent and various disturbances during the\r\nsessions of his class, which often put the good-natured and\r\nunsophisticated man at his wits' end. He complained to the college\r\nboard, and President Barnard took the matter up with some seriousness,\r\nbut no real appeasement.\r\n\r\nI felt great sympathy for Dr. McVickar, for he was earnest and gentle,\r\nand took much to heart the conduct of the men in his class. Of course,\r\nin common with most of my classmates I strongly favored that the\r\nsubject be elective instead of compulsory; yet I realized that, as\r\ncolleges were then constituted, the original Columbia being largely an\r\nEpiscopalian foundation, there was a legal right, as distinguished from\r\nreason, for the requirement that the course in Evidences of Christianity\r\nbe compulsory.\r\n\r\nOne day when the disturbances became most flagrant, and the poor\r\nprofessor was really quite helpless, I ventured to point out to him how\r\nhe might bring about order. He received my suggestion most favorably, so\r\nI asked him to let me take his chair for a few moments. I made a brief\r\nappeal to the class, reminding them that we were now seniors, and that\r\nthere were some, especially those intending to study for the ministry,\r\nwho were interested in the subject and prevented from following it by\r\nthe boisterous behavior of the rest. I was jeeringly dubbed Professor\r\nStraus, but I went right on. I said I knew there were a number who were\r\nopposed to the study of Evidences of Christianity, and I proposed that\r\nthey rise. To those who got up I gave permission to leave the room, and\r\nas I recall it, there were some eight or ten left. Then I turned to Dr.\r\nMcVickar and said, \"Here is a class you can teach.\" And the session went\r\non smoothly enough. Subsequently a petition was drawn up and signed by a\r\nlarge majority of the class, asking that we be excused from examinations\r\nin this particular subject; but President Barnard replied that the\r\nrequest could not be entertained.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the whole my four years at college were full of serious effort and\r\nnot altogether free from anxiety. I had a restless ambition to have a\r\nuseful career and it seemed difficult to discover for what I was best\r\nfitted. For a while, in those dreamy days, I even believed I might\r\nachieve some measure of success as a poet. I recall with a smile that\r\nthe choice for class poet at commencement lay between Brander Matthews,\r\nwhom we then knew as James Brander Matthews, and myself. And for some\r\nreason, which posterity will doubtless find even more difficult to\r\nfathom than I have, I was chosen. Matthews had already given evidence of\r\nhis literary talents; he contributed much to the college papers, and\r\nwrote humorous poems. However, at our graduation exercises held in the\r\nAcademy of Music, Fourteenth Street and Irving Place, the city's largest\r\nauditorium then, my class poem was well received by a capacity audience\r\nof proud parents and sympathetic friends. I had gravely entitled it\r\n\"Truth and Error.\"\r\n\r\nA more fervent aspiration held by me in those years was to devote my\r\nlife to the nation, and I could conceive no better way of doing so than\r\nto enter the army. One day I saw an item in the press that President\r\nGrant had several appointments to make to the United States Military\r\nAcademy. I consulted with Dr. F. A. P. Barnard, president of Columbia,\r\nand he gave me a letter of introduction to Grant, highly commending me\r\nfor an appointment. When President Grant came to New York I called on\r\nhim. He received me very kindly, but informed me that he had only\r\nsomething like eight appointments allowed him by law, and he had decided\r\nto give them where possible to the sons of officers who had been killed\r\nin the war; if, however, there were not enough such candidates he would\r\nbe glad to give me a chance. I told him I thoroughly agreed that his\r\ndecision was so appropriate that I would not even ask to be appointed\r\nunder the circumstances.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OSCAR S. STRAUS\r\n\r\nAt the time of his graduation]\r\n\r\nDuring the second half of my senior year I finally chose the law as\r\nmy vocation. I preferred it to a business career because I disliked the\r\nidea of devoting my life to mere money-making, as business appeared to\r\nme then. My outlook was idealistic rather than practical, and to\r\nharmonize it with the workaday world caused me much mental anguish and\r\nstruggle, as it does many a young man, even where affluent fortune has\r\nsmiled. However, my father and brother had begun to prosper and had no\r\nneed for my cooperation unless on my own account I chose to join them.\r\nBesides, I was the youngest and had the benefit of the brotherly\r\ninterest and economic protection of Isidor and Nathan, should I need it.\r\nThis gave me a feeling of security, and encouraged me to put forth my\r\nbest efforts not only to succeed for myself, but to show my appreciation\r\nto them. Where, under moderate circumstances, a family puts forth\r\ncooperative effort in making its way forward, closer family ties result,\r\nwith the advantages of stimulating unselfishness and common devotion,\r\nwhich in turn promote a happiness that members of richer families often\r\nmiss because of their more independent relations.\r\n\r\nSo I prepared to enter Columbia Law School in the fall of 1871.\r\nMeanwhile that summer I took my first vacation since coming to New York.\r\nI went to Wyoming Valley, near Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, where I had a\r\ngood time despite the farmer with whom I boarded. Perhaps I had no right\r\nto expect much for the five dollars a week I paid him; but whatever I\r\nexpected I know I got less. However, there were fish in the brooks and I\r\ndo not recall that I starved. I had spent other summers assisting in\r\nsome branch of my father's business, not because I relished work unduly,\r\nbut because I regarded it less as labor than as diversion. It was\r\ninteresting and useful activity which gave me an understanding of\r\nbusiness that was valuable later in following my chosen profession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nLAW, BUSINESS, AND LETTERS\r\n\r\n     Columbia Law School--Impressions of the faculty--I begin law\r\n     practice--Early partnerships--A $10,000 fee--Founding of the Young\r\n     Men's Hebrew Association in 1874--The \"dissipations\" of a law\r\n     partner--The Hepburn Committee on railway rates; my partner Simon\r\n     Sterne represents the Chamber of Commerce--On the bridle-path with\r\n     Joseph H.

The course covered\r\ntwo years, at the end of which a successful examination entitled a\r\nstudent to admission to the bar without a further State examination, and\r\nfor those who gave serious attention to the course it was an easy matter\r\nto pass this finishing examination.\r\n\r\nParticularly worthy of mention with regard to the school are Professors\r\nTheodore W. Dwight and Francis Lieber. Professor Dwight, the able\r\ndirector of the school at that time, well deserved his great reputation\r\nas the most distinguished teacher of law in the country. He was not only\r\na master of his subject, but had a marvelous gift for imparting his\r\ngreat knowledge.\r\n\r\nProfessor Lieber, whose lectures we attended once a week, taught us\r\npolitical science. He was a Prussian veteran who fought in the Battle of\r\nWaterloo. At the close of the Napoleonic Wars he had returned to his\r\nstudies in Berlin, and thereafter was arrested several times for his\r\noutspoken liberal views. After frequent persecution and even\r\nimprisonment, he fled to England, and in 1827 came to America.\r\n\r\nHe was author of many books on legal and political matters, among them\r\n\"Civil Liberty and Self-Government,\" which was adopted as a textbook in\r\nseveral of our universities. In 1863 he prepared \"Instructions for the\r\nGovernment of Armies of the United States, in the Field,\" which Lincoln\r\npromulgated as Order No. 100 of the War Department. It was a masterly\r\npiece of work, embodying advanced humanitarian principles, and it later\r\nformed the basis of several European codes.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, egotism and real merit negate one another rather than\r\ncooerdinate; Lieber was the exception. He had both, and combined them to\r\na marked degree, sometimes in a manner that afforded amusement to his\r\nstudents. For instance, he referred continuously to \"my Civil Liberty\"\r\nas a book of extraordinary erudition, new in its field and the last word\r\non the matter. He was so full of his subject that he was apt to lose\r\nhimself and stray off, with his distinctly German accent, into the vast\r\nfield of his profound philosophical and historical knowledge. A\r\nveritable encyclopaedia of information, he was really more of an\r\nexpounder than a teacher. As his course was optional, those who came to\r\nlisten came to learn, and we received a larger view of the function of\r\nlaw in civil society than we derived from all our studies of municipal\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI was graduated from law school in June, 1873, and immediately entered\r\nthe offices of Ward, Jones & Whitehead, one of New York's prominent\r\nfirms. John E. Ward, the senior member, who presided over the Democratic\r\nNational Convention that nominated Buchanan, and later served for two or\r\nthree years as Minister to China, was a friend of my brother's, and he\r\ntook me into his office largely out of friendship for Isidor.\r\n\r\nI remained with this firm only a few months. Later in 1873 I formed a\r\npartnership with James A. Hudson, a man about ten years older than I,\r\nwho had also been associated with the Ward firm. As Hudson & Straus we\r\nopened offices on the fourth floor of 59 Wall Street.\r\n\r\nOn the same floor in this building was the office of Charles O'Conor,\r\nthen the acknowledged head of the American Bar. He had practically\r\nretired, but retained a small office of one or two rooms, with one\r\nclerk. He came in only two or three times a week. Often when he felt\r\nfatigued he would rest on a lounge in a room set apart as library in our\r\noffice. For a young lawyer like myself it was an unusual privilege to\r\nhave such pleasant personal relations with so able and wise a leader in\r\nthe profession. Incidentally I think O'Conor was instrumental in sending\r\nus our first important case, the collection of an old debt of\r\nconsiderable size. We were so successful for our client that, of his own\r\naccord, he sent us a check for ten thousand dollars, saying he would\r\nmake it larger if we regarded it insufficient. The fact was, the amount\r\nwas larger than we had thought of charging, and we frankly told him so.\r\nWith five thousand dollars in reserve I felt rich and independent. My\r\nwants were naturally simple and our general practice was encouraging.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt about this time I first became active in public-spirited\r\nundertakings. The Young Men's Christian Association a few years before\r\nhad opened its Twenty-Third Street Branch at the corner of Fourth Avenue\r\nand Twenty-Third Street, and the movement on the whole was getting much\r\npublicity and proving very successful in its work among young men. But\r\nit was an institution for Christians, and it occurred to several of\r\nus--as I remember it, there were two of my fellow members of the bar,\r\nMeyer S. Isaacs and Isaac S. Isaacs; Dr. Simeon N. Leo, Solomon B.\r\nSolomon, and myself--that it would be a useful undertaking if we\r\norganized a Young Men's Hebrew Association for the cultural and\r\nintellectual advancement of Jewish young men. After a few preliminary\r\nmeetings we launched our project early in 1874. We rented a house in the\r\nvicinity of Nineteenth or Twentieth Street and began in a very modest\r\nway. Our first entertainment was of a purely literary nature, and I\r\nrecollect on that occasion addressing the members of the infant\r\nenterprise on the subject of literary clubs, ancient and modern, from\r\nthe time of Socrates and Plato to the days of the coffee houses of\r\nAddison, Steele, and Goldsmith. The Y.M.H.A. subsequently had its years\r\nof struggle for existence, but to-day its place in our cities as an\r\ninfluence for the development of culture and patriotism is assured, as\r\nwell as that of its sister organization of later birth, the Young\r\nWomen's Hebrew Association.\r\n\r\nI had chosen the law as my profession, but I still wrote verse, and in\r\nthe decade following my graduation published several pieces. At one\r\nmemorable event I was invited to deliver an original poem. It was in\r\n1875, at a large fair in Gilmore's Garden, the predecessor of the\r\npresent Madison Square Garden. The fair was held to raise funds toward\r\nthe erection of a new building for the Mount Sinai Hospital, and the\r\nimmense auditorium was crowded. Samuel J. Tilden, then Governor of New\r\nYork and also prospective Democratic nominee for President, made the\r\nopening address. My poetic possibilities, however, rested more upon\r\naspiration than inspiration, and my craving for versification was but a\r\npassing phase of my literary activities.\r\n\r\nAbout 1876 we removed our office to the New York Life Building, then, as\r\nnow, at 346 Broadway, corner of Leonard Street. Our clientele was\r\nmostly commercial and this neighborhood seemed more convenient. Our\r\nneighbors at the new location were Chamberlain, Carter & Eaton, a\r\nprominent commercial law firm of which Charles E. Hughes subsequently\r\nbecame a member.\r\n\r\nA few years later we took into our firm Simon Sterne, then one of the\r\nbrilliant younger members of the bar, and our firm became Sterne, Hudson\r\n& Straus. But Hudson wanted to devote himself to patent law, in which he\r\nhad specialized somewhat, so the firm soon changed again to Sterne,\r\nStraus & Thompson. Daniel G. Thompson had been our managing clerk. He\r\nhad an attractive personality and a philosophical temperament, but was\r\nmore a psychologist than a lawyer. He was author of several works on the\r\nscience and history of psychology which were favorably received and\r\ncommended by such men as Herbert Spencer and other high authorities in\r\nboth Europe and America. These qualities made him a target for the\r\nsarcasm of Sterne, who, on the other hand, was thoroughly the lawyer. On\r\none occasion I remember Sterne asking me whether I knew Thompson was\r\ndissipating. I expressed surprise, and Sterne went on: \"Certainly he is,\r\nfor when he goes home he works till all hours of the night writing\r\npsychology, and naturally next day he comes with an exhausted brain to\r\nhis legal work. He might better go on a spree, for one gets over that.\r\nBut when one buries one's self in such an exacting science he is lost\r\nfor the law, which is a jealous mistress and will not bear a rival.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUnder the name of Sterne, Straus & Thompson we had a practice that\r\nranged all the way from the collection of debts to questions affecting\r\nstreet railways and public utilities. Our old firm had a business like\r\nthat of most young lawyers, but Sterne's practice was much more\r\nimportant, his field being mainly banking and railroads. Sterne, in\r\nfact, was rapidly achieving a reputation as an authority in the State on\r\nrailways and railway legislation. At that time there was no Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission. Many New York merchants were complaining, through\r\nthe New York Chamber of Commerce and the New York Board of Trade and\r\nTransportation, that the railroads were discriminating and giving to\r\ncertain shippers much lower rates than to others, also giving preference\r\nto some in the moving of freight. In 1879 the Legislature finally\r\nappointed a committee of eight men to investigate these charges. A.\r\nBarton Hepburn, member of the Assembly from St. Lawrence County, was\r\nmade chairman, causing the committee always thereafter to be referred to\r\nas the Hepburn Committee. Sterne represented the Chamber of Commerce and\r\nthe Board of Trade in this investigation.\r\n\r\nThe committee sat intermittently for about nine months. The railroads\r\nhad a brilliant array of legal talent, but Sterne elicited testimony\r\nfrom them which proved the charges of the merchants. Sterne then drafted\r\nthe report of the committee, which included several recommendations for\r\nlegislation. It was the first impressive and well-directed attempt to\r\ndeal with the regulation of transportation companies, and resulted in\r\nthe passage, in 1880, of the bill creating the first Board of Railroad\r\nCommissioners. Later, in 1887, the influence of this work was still\r\nalive in connection with legislation for the creation of the Federal\r\nInterstate Commerce Commission. The business of our firm did not exactly\r\nbenefit by this public service of Sterne. As a result of his public\r\nactivities and settlement of litigation, such railway clients as we had\r\nwere lost to us at about this time.\r\n\r\nAt this point in my career I have the fond recollection of a dear and\r\nintimate friendship, which continued for several years, with Joseph H.\r\nChoate, of the firm of Evarts, Southmayd & Choate. We used to ride\r\nhorseback together in the park before breakfast. This intimacy naturally\r\nwas very valuable to me. We discussed all manner of topics, not only\r\naffecting our profession, but touching many public matters and the\r\nphilosophy of life and living in general. In these morning hours, with\r\nthe exhilaration of our ride, Mr. Choate was always full of fun and good\r\nhumor. He was the most sought after person for addressing all important\r\npublic functions, and frequently he would outline the substance of his\r\naddresses. Speaking one day of the many demands upon him as a speaker,\r\nhe remarked that he appeared to be in the fashion just then, but, like\r\nwall-paper, fashions change, and it was not likely to last long. In his\r\ncase, however, the fashion lasted, even increased, until his death in\r\n1917.\r\n\r\nMy major law work was in the most exacting and nerve-racking branch, the\r\ntrying of cases. My general physical condition, though never robust, was\r\nnone the less good, but I had not learned what one is more apt to\r\nacquire later in life: to conserve my energies. The result was that the\r\nwear and tear of court work reduced my weight to one hundred and five\r\npounds. My physician strongly advised me to do less exacting work, and\r\nespecially to stop trying cases. As this branch of the law appealed to\r\nme most, it was a grave disappointment to have to abandon it. Rather\r\nthan continue in the profession with such an inhibition, therefore, I\r\nyielded to the advice of my father and brother to join their firm.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI took a vacation of several months, and upon my return early in 1881 I\r\nbecame a member of L. Straus & Sons, who had become large manufacturers\r\nand importers of china and glassware. On account of the growing business\r\nthey really needed my services, and my transition from professional to\r\nbusiness man was made as acceptable and agreeable as possible. As was to\r\nbe expected, I continued for some time to long for \"the fleshpots of\r\nEgypt,\" for I was much attached to my profession. As a compensation, and\r\nto satisfy my intellectual longings, I devoted my evenings and spare\r\ntime to historical reading and study.\r\n\r\nHaving embarked on a business career, I reversed a decision that I made\r\nwhile practicing law. As a lawyer I had taken very seriously and\r\nliterally the saying that \"the law is a jealous mistress.\" I was her\r\ndevoted slave, quite willingly so, and I determined never to marry. I\r\nwas economically independent as a single man and could devote my time to\r\nthe law for its own sake. This I preferred to do, as the idealist that I\r\nwas, rather than pursue the law for economic reasons first and for its\r\nown sake as much as possible secondarily, which I felt would have to be\r\nthe case if I married. But as a business man things were different, and\r\nI decided now to marry.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn January 22, 1882, I became engaged to Sarah, only daughter of Louis\r\nand Hannah Seller Lavanburg, and we were married on the 19th of April\r\nfollowing, at the home of her parents on West Forty-Sixth Street, near\r\nFifth Avenue. At the wedding dinner, to which had come hosts of our\r\nfriends and acquaintances, Joaquin Miller, poet of the Sierras, as he\r\nwas called, read a poem which he composed for the event. The manuscript\r\nI think is still in my possession.\r\n\r\nIn the year of my marriage I also made my debut in politics. I was\r\nsecretary of the Executive Committee of an independent group organized\r\nfor the reelection of William R. Grace as mayor of New York. The\r\ndistinguished lawyer, Frederick R. Coudert, was chairman of that\r\ncommittee. Grace had been a Tammany mayor and given the city a good\r\nbusiness administration--so good and so independent that Tammany refused\r\nto nominate him for a second term. On the independent ticket Grace had a\r\nlarge Republican as well as the independent Democratic support, and was\r\nduly elected.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI next took part in the Cleveland-Blaine campaign. In 1884 we formed in\r\nNew York City the Cleveland and Hendricks Merchants' and Business Men's\r\nAssociation, of which I was secretary of the executive committee, and we\r\ncooperated with the Democratic National Committee, Senator Arthur P.\r\nGorman, chairman, whose headquarters were at the old Fifth Avenue Hotel,\r\ncorner of Fifth Avenue and Twenty-Third Street. We organized a parade\r\nand marched forty thousand strong from lower Broadway to Thirty-Fourth\r\nStreet. It was the first time business men had ever been organized along\r\npolitical lines.\r\n\r\nAll who remember this campaign know what an exciting and close battle it\r\nwas. The dramatic event which doubtless put the balance in Cleveland's\r\nfavor was the speech of the Rev. Dr. Samuel D. Burchard, a Presbyterian\r\nminister of New York, at Republican headquarters. A few days before the\r\nelection the Republican managers had called what they termed a\r\nministers' meeting, to which came some six hundred clergymen of all\r\ndenominations to meet Mr. Blaine. Dr. Burchard, noted as an orator, was\r\nto speak, followed by Mr. Blaine. In concluding his address, Dr.\r\nBurchard evidently lost control of his dignity, for he stigmatized the\r\nDemocratic Party as the party of \"rum, Romanism, and rebellion.\" In the\r\nface of the great efforts the Republican Party had made, with some\r\nmeasure of success, to secure the Roman Catholic vote, this denunciation\r\ngave a big opportunity to the Democrats. Furthermore, Blaine, keen a\r\npolitician as he was, failed immediately to repudiate the remark.\r\n\r\nI was present at Democratic headquarters when the reporter who had been\r\nsent to this meeting returned. Senator Gorman asked him to read from his\r\nshorthand notes, and when he came to the expression, \"rum, Romanism, and\r\nrebellion,\" Gorman at once said, \"Write that out.\" The Democratic\r\nmanagers saw their chance. Quickly the whole country was placarded with\r\nposters headed \"R.R.R.,\" with all sorts of variations and additions of\r\nthe original phrase. In the end it was the New York vote that determined\r\nthe victory for the Democrats, and doubtless because of the influence\r\nthe words of Dr. Burchard had had upon Roman Catholic voters.\r\n\r\nWhen the election returns were in, Cleveland had won by only 1047 votes.\r\nBecause of the closeness of the vote in New York the Republicans did not\r\nat first concede the victory. Among the Democrats, on the other hand,\r\nthere was a great feeling of bitterness and nervous apprehension lest an\r\neffort be made to make it a Republican victory, as was the case in 1876\r\nwhen the uncertain returns were decided by an electoral commission,\r\nwhich, to the disappointment of many, made its decision on party lines.\r\nJay Gould, who controlled the telegraph lines, was accused by the\r\nDemocrats of holding back returns.\r\n\r\nThe Merchants' and Business Men's Association promptly organized a large\r\nmeeting in the Academy of Music, to proclaim and celebrate Cleveland's\r\nelection. August Belmont, Sr., as chairman, presided, and I, as\r\nsecretary, presented the resolutions. We had invited the most prominent\r\nspeakers we could get, and there were Henry Ward Beecher, Daniel\r\nDougherty of Philadelphia, Algernon S. Sullivan, among others. I\r\ndistinctly recall a humorous and cryptic remark of Beecher's address\r\nthat day: \"If the chair is too small, make it larger\"--referring to\r\nCleveland's avoirdupois and the claim that he did not fit in the\r\npresidential chair. The note of victory, and the determination to stand\r\nby that victory at all costs, had a reassuring effect throughout the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nWhen the campaign was over I was told by a member of the National\r\nCommittee that if there was any political office to which I aspired, the\r\nCommittee would be glad to further any ambition I might have; but I\r\nreplied my only wish was that Cleveland live up to the political\r\nprinciples which had brought him the support of so many independent or\r\n\"mugwump\" voters and so made possible his election.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1883-84 the Young Men's Hebrew Association invited\r\nme to speak in their course of lectures. I was to choose my own subject.\r\nThey had hired Chickering Hall, at Fifth Avenue and Fifteenth Street, a\r\nlarge lecture hall in those days, and as great importance was being\r\nattached to the occasion I naturally put my best foot forward in the\r\npreparation of my material. I chose as my theme \"The Origin of the\r\nRepublican Form of Government.\" In it I traced the rise of democracy, in\r\ncontradistinction to monarchy, from the Hebrew Commonwealth as expounded\r\nin the Old Testament and interpreted by the early Puritans of New\r\nEngland, especially in their \"election sermons,\" which were of a\r\npolitico-religious character and were delivered annually before the\r\nlegislatures of the various New England colonies.\r\n\r\nThere was a huge audience, and the next morning the press gave very\r\ngenerous reports of the address. It attracted the attention of various\r\nministers in Brooklyn, and subsequently I was asked to repeat it before\r\nthe Long Island Historical Society, in that city. There I had an amusing\r\nexperience. In the course of the talk I quoted ideas similar to mine\r\nthat had been advanced over a hundred years before by Thomas Paine in\r\nhis \"Common Sense,\" and I referred to the high estimates of Paine held\r\nby Washington, Monroe, Dr. Rush, and others of the time. I refrained\r\nfrom expressing opinions of my own, contenting myself with a reference\r\nto those of the fathers of the Republic. Suddenly, however, several\r\nministers left the hall, protesting that they had not come to hear a\r\neulogy on Paine.\r\n\r\nLater I developed this address, under its original title, and published\r\nit in book form. The first edition came out in 1885. The appearance of a\r\nfirst book is quite an event in one's life, especially when it is well\r\nreceived among critics and by the press. At any rate, it seemed like a\r\nlandmark in my own life. Historical writers referred to it as a distinct\r\ncontribution to our historical literature, and I felt that so far as the\r\npen was concerned I had discovered this branch of writing to be my forte\r\nrather than poetry. After all, historical writing is no less imaginative\r\nthan poetry. Without the use of imagination history is lifeless and a\r\ndry record of facts instead of literature.\r\n\r\nA second impression of the book was issued in 1887, and in 1901 a second\r\nand revised edition was published. A French edition had appeared\r\nsimultaneously in Paris and Brussels, 1890, translated by M. Emile de\r\nLaveleye, eminent Belgian publicist and professor at the University of\r\nLiege, and containing an introductory essay by him. This essay was\r\ntranslated into English and embodied in the 1901 American edition. Since\r\nthen additional impressions of this revised edition have appeared. I\r\nmight mention that on the strength of this book I was admitted to\r\nmembership in the Authors' Club, in 1888.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the fall of the year following the original publication of my first\r\nbook I chanced to meet Senator Gorman of Maryland in the Palmer House,\r\nChicago, where we both happened to be stopping--he on his return from a\r\ntrip to the Far West, and I on an important business errand. He told me\r\nhe and his son had read my book on their trip, and that he had not in a\r\nlong time read a book with so much valuable information in it and giving\r\nsuch a clear view of the sources and early growth of our form of\r\ngovernment. We naturally talked of matters political, and he reminded me\r\nof an earlier conversation he had had with me since Cleveland's\r\nelection, stating that Mr. Cox--S.S. Cox--our minister to Turkey, had or\r\nwas about to resign, and that he would like to recommend me to President\r\nCleveland for appointment in Cox's place. He thought at the same time it\r\nmight enable me to make further studies along the lines of my book.\r\n\r\nThe idea was a complete surprise to me. As I have mentioned, I had no\r\nthought of entering public life. My political activities had been\r\nlimited to the part I took in the re-election of Mayor Grace and the\r\nCleveland-Blaine, campaign. Even had I been ambitious for a political\r\nposition I should never have ventured application for a diplomatic post,\r\nfor I had never given much attention to our foreign relations. Besides,\r\nI had been in business only a few years, I was married and had two small\r\ndaughters; everything considered, I felt I could not afford to leave my\r\naffairs to go abroad.\r\n\r\nUpon returning to New York I conferred with my father and brothers, and\r\ntheir attitude changed my views somewhat. They generously offered to see\r\nthat my interests should not suffer, and gave me every encouragement to\r\nentertain Senator Gorman's suggestion. I could not possibly have further\r\nconsidered the subject without this generosity on their part. My\r\nobligations to my family did not permit the expenditure of several times\r\nmy salary, required in a position of this kind. The salary of minister\r\nto Turkey had been reduced to seven thousand five hundred dollars,\r\nthough it was subsequently restored to ten thousand; and in order to\r\nlive properly he had to rent a winter house in the capital and a summer\r\nhouse outside, or live in hotels as Mr. Cox, and his predecessor,\r\nGeneral Lew Wallace, did. General Wallace was restricted to his salary\r\nand felt compelled to decline the invitations of his colleagues because\r\nhe was not in position to reciprocate. (His \"Ben Hur,\" by the way, he\r\nhad written before his sojourn in the East, and not afterward as is\r\noften supposed.)\r\n\r\nSenator Gorman was not finally able to make the recommendation he had\r\nproposed. His relations with the President became strained, so that\r\nrecommendations for appointments coming from him were not regarded with\r\nfavor by Cleveland. Gorman told me as much when we met subsequently, but\r\nadvised me to use such influence as I might command in other directions.\r\n\r\nI presently spoke of it to an old friend of my days in the law, B.\r\nFranklin Einstein, who was counsel for the \"New York Times\" and the\r\npersonal adviser of George Jones, its proprietor. Einstein suggested\r\nthat I speak with Jones about it, and this I did. Jones encouraged me\r\nand said he would be glad to help. He said he had read my book and felt\r\nsure I would give a good account of myself and be a credit to the\r\nadministration; that he had never asked any favor of the administration\r\nand felt justified in asking Cleveland to make the appointment. The\r\n\"Times\" had been an independent Republican paper, but in the campaign of\r\n1884 it came out for Cleveland.\r\n\r\nI also conferred with Carl Schurz, with whom I stood on intimate terms,\r\nand with John Foord, another friend. In the early eighties we used to\r\nhave a lunch club that met about once in two weeks at a little French\r\nrestaurant, August Sieghortner's, at 32 Lafayette Place, now Lafayette\r\nStreet, in a house that had been a former residence of one of the\r\nAstors. We used to discuss various political and reform matters--the\r\n\"mugwump\" movement, the Cleveland campaigns, or what not. There were ten\r\nor twelve of us, and Carl Schurz was one; the late Charles R. Miller,\r\nwho was for many years the leading editorial writer of the \"Times,\" was\r\nanother; and John Foord, whose death by accident occurred in Washington\r\nonly a few days ago as I write, was another. Foord was then\r\neditor-in-chief of the \"Times.\" He took up my appointment with both\r\nPresident Cleveland and Secretary of State Bayard. Schurz encouraged me\r\nand said he would speak to Oswald Ottendorfer about having me appointed.\r\nOttendorfer, proprietor of the \"New Yorker Staatszeitung,\" was a client\r\nof our law firm and knew me well. Subsequently I saw him and he wrote to\r\nCleveland strongly recommending the appointment.\r\n\r\nCleveland was favorably enough impressed, but he hesitated. He said our\r\nchief concern in Turkey was the protection of American missionary\r\ninterests, and he would not like to appoint any one to this particular\r\nmission who might be objected to by the two principal missionary\r\nbodies--the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions and the\r\nPresbyterian Board of Missions.\r\n\r\nIt happened that on a return trip from Washington about this time my\r\nbrother Isidor met A. S. Barnes, prominent textbook publisher and a\r\nmember of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, to\r\nwhom also I was quite well known. He had been in frequent consultation\r\nwith our law firm when we represented the City of Brooklyn in its suit\r\nagainst the Atlantic Avenue Railroad to compel the road to sink its\r\ntracks, in which suit, as one of Brooklyn's public-spirited citizens, he\r\nwas much interested. He was sympathetic toward me and brought the\r\nsubject of my appointment before his missionary board, with the result\r\nthat its Prudential Committee wrote a letter to the President expressing\r\nfullest approval of my appointment, suggesting only that I be asked not\r\nto hold receptions on the Sabbath, as one of my predecessors had done to\r\nthe great disapproval of the missionaries and all Protestant Christians\r\nin Constantinople. Even without this intimation I would quite naturally\r\nhave refrained from offending the religious sensibilities of my\r\nnationals at that post.\r\n\r\nThe representatives of all the Protestant churches who had interests in\r\nTurkey were most generous in favoring the appointment when they learned\r\nthat I was being considered for that mission. The most admired and best\r\nbeloved American preacher of his time, Henry Ward Beecher, of Plymouth\r\nChurch, Brooklyn, heard of it through Mr. O. A. Gager, one of the\r\ntrustees of his church; also that there was some diffidence about my\r\nactual selection because of my religion. He immediately wrote the\r\nPresident a beautiful and characteristic letter, urging my appointment.\r\nThe original of this letter, now in my possession, was given to me by\r\nGovernor Porter, first assistant Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nWith my wife I had gone to Atlantic City for a few days, to recuperate\r\nfrom a cold, when on March 24, 1887, I received telegrams from friends\r\nall over the country congratulating me on my appointment as minister to\r\nTurkey. The papers of the day announced it, and the \"New York Times\"\r\npublished the Beecher letter just referred to.\r\n\r\nTo the press of the country my appointment was of added interest because\r\nof the Keiley incident of two years before. A. M. Keiley, of Virginia,\r\nwas nominated by Cleveland as minister to Austria-Hungary, but objected\r\nto by that country because Mrs. Keiley, being of Jewish parentage, was\r\n_persona non grata_. As a matter of fact this excuse for the rejection\r\nof Keiley was supposedly made because the Austro-Hungarian Government\r\nthought it might be acceptable to us in lieu of the truth.\r\n\r\nThe real reason lay much deeper. Keiley had earlier been nominated as\r\nminister to Italy. The Italian Government, through its representative at\r\nWashington, made known to our Department of State that Keiley would be\r\n_persona non grata_ because it was remembered that in 1870 he had made a\r\npublic speech in Richmond violently denouncing King Victor Emmanuel for\r\nhis treatment of the Pope. The nomination was therefore withdrawn. And\r\nwhen a few months later Keiley was appointed minister to\r\nAustria-Hungary, that country, being a member with Italy in the Triple\r\nAlliance, did not want to run the risk of displeasing Italy by accepting\r\na representative not satisfactory to her; but not wishing to admit this,\r\nbased its excuse on religious grounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hand written letter page 1]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hand written letter page 2]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hand written letter page 3]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hand written letter page 4]\r\n\r\nThis so incensed our Administration that Secretary Bayard rebuked the\r\nAustro-Hungarian Government with the statement:\r\n\r\n     It is not within the power of the President nor of the Congress,\r\n     nor of any judicial tribunal in the United States, to take or even\r\n     hear testimony, or in any mode to inquire into or decide upon the\r\n     religious belief of any official, and the proposition to allow this\r\n     to be done by any foreign Government is necessarily and _a\r\n     fortiori_ inadmissible.\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Cleveland made reference to the episode in his First Annual\r\nMessage to Congress:\r\n\r\n     The reasons advanced were such as could not be acquiesced in,\r\n     without violation of my oath of office and the precepts of the\r\n     Constitution, since they necessarily involved a limitation in favor\r\n     of a foreign government upon the right of selection by the\r\n     Executive, and required such an application of a religious test as\r\n     a qualification for office under the United States as would have\r\n     resulted in the practical disfranchisement of a large class of our\r\n     citizens and the abandonment of a vital principle of our\r\n     Government.\r\n\r\nThese statements contain a clear exposition of one of the fundamental\r\nprinciples of our laws and system of government; they form one of the\r\nmost illuminating and inspiring chapters of our diplomatic literature.\r\nFollowing the Keiley incident, my appointment was a silent but effective\r\nprotest against such illiberal views as those expressed by\r\nAustria-Hungary; and to me personally it meant something to be sent as\r\nthe representative of my country to the power whose dominion extended\r\nover the land that cradled my race, Palestine.\r\n\r\nLeaving Atlantic City, we soon proceeded to Washington, where I called\r\non Secretary Bayard, who received me with characteristic cordiality and\r\nreferred me to John Bassett Moore, now our famous authority on\r\ninternational law, compiler of the International Law Digest, American\r\njudge of the Court of International Justice by vote of the Council and\r\nAssembly of the League of Nations. At the time I met him, thirty-five\r\nyears ago, he was third assistant Secretary of State, and I could not\r\nhave wished for a better instructor in the intricate matters that\r\ninvolved our relations with the Ottoman Empire.\r\n\r\nAlvey A. Adee, veteran of our Foreign Office, then as now the second\r\nassistant Secretary of State, was another man who gave me most helpful\r\nadvice. His encyclopaedic knowledge of our foreign relations for more\r\nthan forty years is remarkable, and our diplomatic appointees for years\r\nhave been indebted to him for much helpful guidance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLater in the day we called on the President. Our conversation during\r\nthis call was purely of a general nature, and as I was leaving Mr.\r\nCleveland expressed pleasure at my promptness in calling and hoped that\r\nI would start for Turkey as soon as personal convenience permitted. When\r\nI told him I hoped to sail at the end of a week, he answered, \"That is\r\nbusinesslike; I like that,\" and he asked me to call again before leaving\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nTwo days later, by appointment of Colonel Lamont, the President's\r\nsecretary, Mrs. Straus and I, accompanied by brother Isidor and E. G.\r\nDunnell, \"New York Times\" correspondent, called on Mrs. Cleveland in the\r\nGreen Room of the White House. I vividly recall this visit. Mrs.\r\nCleveland came into the room with a sprightly and unceremonious walk,\r\nvery friendly, with charm of manner and a sufficient familiarity to put\r\nus entirely at our ease. She was a very handsome woman, with remarkable\r\nsweetness of expression, and her appearance symbolized beauty and\r\nsimplicity.\r\n\r\nWhat most impressed me about the Clevelands, after these two visits,\r\nwas the simple, unassuming manner that was so in keeping with the spirit\r\nof our laws and the democracy of our institutions. Verily, I thought in\r\nthe words of Cleveland himself, \"a public office is a public trust,\" and\r\nwhile administering office we are indeed servants of the people.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Washington we again called on the President as agreed.\r\nHis entire conversation and attitude showed satisfaction with my\r\nappointment. He said he understood the missionaries were doing good\r\nwork, and he felt sure from what he had learned of me that they would\r\nreceive impartial and just treatment at my hands. He commented on the\r\nfact that the press of the country had been so unanimously in favor of\r\nmy appointment. \"I wished they would go for you a little; I have\r\nsomething to give them,\" he said. From Mr. Dunnell later I learned the\r\nmeaning of this remark. He had received a letter from the Prudential\r\nCommittee of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions,\r\nhighly approving of his appointing me as minister to Turkey and\r\nendorsing me of their own accord in unqualified terms. This letter he\r\nwas holding to give to the press should any unfavorable comment be made\r\nbecause a member of the Hebrew race was being sent to a post where the\r\nChristian mission interests were so large. Mr. Cleveland's parting\r\nremark to me was: \"I know you will do well; I have no trepidation--none\r\nat all.\"\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, April 9th, at 6 A.M., we--my wife, Aline, the younger of\r\nour little daughters, and myself--sailed out of the harbor on the S.S.\r\nAurania. My one prayer in bidding farewell to my home was that I might\r\nfind no vacant seat at my table upon my return, and that I might\r\ndischarge my high trust with credit and honor. For this no sacrifice\r\nwould be too great.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nENTERING DIPLOMACY\r\n\r\n     At sea--Our arrival in London--Concerning George Eliot and\r\n     Lewes--At the banking house of Baron de Rothschild--In\r\n     Paris--Boulanger's Napoleonic dreams; his suicide--Josef Hofmann as\r\n     a boy pianist--The artist who painted \"Christ before Pilate\"; an\r\n     extraordinary wife--Distinguished hosts and rich cooking--Vienna\r\n     and the Balkans--Thoughts on passing through the\r\n     Bosphorus--Constantinople, the city of picturesque dirt--Many\r\n     delays obstruct my audience with the Sultan--The fast of\r\n     Ramazan--Diplomatic garden parties--An ambassador's L300 Circassian\r\n     slave-wife--The Sultan says his prayers--Advice from a seasoned\r\n     diplomat--My address at Robert College commencement--In the\r\n     Sultan's Palace.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur voyage was not altogether a light one. We had found it expedient to\r\nleave Mildred, our elder daughter, then four years old, with her Grandma\r\nLavanburg; and while she was in excellent hands my wife was naturally\r\nheavy-hearted at the thought of traveling so far and for so long without\r\nher. The weather on board ship was for the most part stormy. Our little\r\nAline and her nurse were so seasick that the child resented being on\r\nboard with all the force of age three. \"Mama, this ship is nobody's\r\nhome; why did you bring me here? I shall write sister Milly never to go\r\non the ocean,\" she declared rebelliously.\r\n\r\nHaving reached London, however, things went more pleasantly. Our\r\nminister there at the time--we did not yet appoint ambassadors--was\r\nEdward J. Phelps, for many years Professor of International Law at Yale,\r\na scholarly gentleman. I called on him almost immediately on my arrival,\r\nand subsequently Mrs. Straus and I dined at the legation to meet Rustem\r\nPasha, Turkish ambassador, veteran diplomat who had been in the service\r\nfor thirty-three years and was about twice as old. He was leading\r\nTurkish representative at the Congress of Berlin in 1878, following the\r\nRusso-Turkish War. He referred to the various questions pending between\r\nhis Government and mine--the interpretation of Article 4 of the Treaty\r\nof 1830, signed only in Turkish; the proposed treaty of 1874, negotiated\r\nby Minister Boker and not confirmed by the Senate, concerning\r\nnaturalized citizens of the United States returning to Turkey;\r\nmissionary matters; our refusal to negotiate a treaty for the\r\nextradition of criminals. I had informed myself regarding all of these,\r\nbut I deemed it wise not to discuss them in detail; rather I chose to be\r\nthe listener and draw him out, assuring him that when I arrived at my\r\npost all these subjects would have my very best attention. He was\r\nparticularly concerned with the treaty for the extradition of criminals,\r\nbut the so-called criminals that came to the United States at that\r\nperiod, especially from Russia and Turkey, were with rare exception\r\npolitical refugees, and it is provided in most of our extradition\r\ntreaties that political offenders are not to be delivered up.\r\n\r\nWe remained in London about ten days, calling on a number of interesting\r\npeople. We spent one pleasant evening with Dr. and Mrs. John Chapman, of\r\nthe \"Westminster Review.\" My article on \"The Development of Religious\r\nLiberty in America\" was appearing in a current number of the \"Review.\"\r\nThe Chapmans were good friends of George Eliot and Professor Lewes. In\r\nfact, the novelist and the professor first met at the Chapman home. Dr.\r\nChapman also told me he was the one who first employed George Eliot in\r\nliterary work. He became editor of the \"Review\" in 1851 and engaged her\r\nas associate editor. When George Eliot resigned, Mrs. Chapman became the\r\nassociate editor. With us that evening, too, was Harold Frederic, London\r\ncorrespondent of the \"New York Times\" and a novelist of some promise.\r\n\r\nFrom Messrs. J. & W. Seligman of New York I had received a letter to the\r\nSeligman banking house in London, at 3 Angel Court. Mr. Isaac Seligman\r\ninvited us to dine _en famille_, and arranged for me to call at Messrs.\r\nN. M. Rothschild & Sons', where I was very pleasantly received by Baron\r\nAlfred Charles de Rothschild, who showed me through his magnificent\r\nbanking establishment and offered to send me a letter to the Paris\r\nRothschild firm. The Baron was then about forty-four years old, very\r\nagreeable, a polished gentleman of the best Jewish type.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Paris, our next stopping-place, we also had a very interesting time.\r\nOf course we called on our minister, Robert M. McLane, then seventy-four\r\nyears old, but looking sixty. He was distinctly of the old school, with\r\nall the grace of manner, combined with ability and wide experience in\r\npublic service--an excellent representative who was esteemed by the\r\nFrench people quite as highly as by our own citizens in France. I speak\r\nof this especially because in capitals like Paris it is not an easy task\r\nto please both elements.\r\n\r\nAt dinner one evening in the home of my friend Adolphe Salmon, an\r\nAmerican merchant residing in Paris, we met Count Dillon and his wife,\r\nmost affable people to whom we felt ourselves immediately attracted. The\r\nCount was a thorough Royalist, had been for many years in the army. At\r\nthis time he was managing director of the Mackay-Bennett Cable Company\r\nand the leader of a movement, really anti-Republican intrigue, designed\r\nto put General Boulanger, Minister of War, at the head of the State. The\r\nCount was a close personal friend and schoolmate of Boulanger, then the\r\nmost extolled man in all France. The Count suggested that he arrange a\r\nluncheon or dinner to have us meet the General, if that was agreeable to\r\nus, for he felt sure the General would be pleased.\r\n\r\nConsequently a few days later we lunched at Count Dillon's beautiful\r\nvilla some thirty minutes outside of Paris. It was an intimate two-hour\r\nluncheon party, just Mr. and Mrs. Adolphe Salmon, the Count and Countess\r\nDillon, General Boulanger, Mrs. Straus, and myself. Boulanger was a\r\nyoung-looking man for his fifty years, of medium height and weight,\r\nwearing a closely trimmed beard; rather Anglo-American than French in\r\nappearance, unassuming, of pleasant expression, and probably at the\r\nheight of his power. Five years before he had been Director of Infantry\r\nin the War Office and made himself very popular as a military reformer.\r\nIn 1886, under the aegis of Clemenceau and the Radical Party which\r\nbrought Freycinet into power, Boulanger was made Minister of War. He was\r\nnoted for his fire-eating attitude toward Germany in connection with the\r\nSchnaebele frontier incident, and because of this was hailed as the man\r\ndestined to give France her revenge for the disasters of 1870. In fact,\r\nthe masses looked upon him as a second Napoleon, \"the man on horseback,\"\r\nand his picture on horseback was displayed in countless shop windows.\r\n\r\nAt our luncheon party he entertained us with many an interesting\r\nanecdote, and I particularly recall his telling of coming to the\r\nYorktown Centennial Celebration and traveling as far as the Pacific\r\nCoast in company with General Sherman to see our fortifications. \"I was\r\nasked what I thought of your American fortifications [\"You know what\r\nantiquated and insignificant things they are,\" in an aside to Mrs.\r\nStraus], and I praised them and said I thought they were splendid, that\r\nI had never seen any better ones because\"--and here his eyes\r\ntwinkled--\"no country has such nice ditches in front of its\r\nfortifications,\" He meant, of course, the Atlantic and the Pacific.\r\n\r\nWhen the champagne was being drunk and toasts were in order I turned to\r\nthe General, after drinking to the health of the company, and said: \"May\r\nyou administer the War Department so successfully that posterity will\r\nknow you as the great preserver of peace.\" To this he responded that for\r\nfifteen years France had always been on the defensive and permitted\r\ninsults rather than take offense, but that the time had come when she\r\ncould no longer do so and must be ready for the offensive. He evidently\r\nhad in mind that war was imminent. At a later meeting he asked me\r\nwhether, in case of war, I would be willing to take charge of French\r\ninterests in Turkey. I told him that while of course it would be\r\nagreeable to me personally, such action could be taken only under the\r\nauthority of my government, which authority I would have to obtain\r\nbefore giving an official answer.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent meteoric career of Boulanger is a matter of history. For\r\ntwo years more his personality was one of the dominating factors of\r\nFrench politics. I remember writing from Constantinople early in 1889:\r\n\"The most menacing condition exists in France, where, I am of opinion,\r\nBoulanger will gain the presidency before many months and from that time\r\nperhaps try to tread in the footprints of his Napoleonic ideal. If\r\nso--alas, poor France, and alas the peace of Europe!\" He had become an\r\nopen menace to the republic; and when Constans was Minister of the\r\nInterior a prosecution was instituted against Boulanger and a warrant\r\nsigned for his arrest. He fled from Paris and was afterward tried and\r\ncondemned _in absentia_ for treason. In 1891 he committed suicide on the\r\ngrave of his mistress in a cemetery at Brussels.\r\n\r\nWe dined, on another evening in Paris, with Mr. and Mrs. William\r\nSeligman, of the banking firm of Seligman Freres, the Paris branch of J.\r\n& W. Seligman of New York and of the London Seligman establishment. This\r\ndinner was a very large and elaborate affair, with many distinguished\r\nguests present. After dinner we were entertained by the budding genius\r\nof Josef Hofmann, then ten or eleven years old.\r\n\r\nThe noted Hungarian, Munkacsy, painter of \"Last Day of a Condemned Man,\"\r\n\"Christ before Pilate,\" \"Christ on Calvary,\" and other celebrated works,\r\nwas also there with his wife. As a couple they presented a striking\r\ncontrast indeed. He was a silent man, talking very little and haltingly;\r\nhe impressed one as a refined artisan of some sort, perhaps a carpenter.\r\nHe was a large man of about five feet ten in height, with bushy hair\r\ncombed up, bushy beard and mustache, and small eyes which he screwed up\r\nto almost nothing when observing something. His wife, on the other hand,\r\nwas as coarse-looking a woman as one might discover, with a loud,\r\nraucous, almost masculine voice which, like a saw in action, rose above\r\nevery other sound. However, I have observed that these contraries in\r\npersonality in couples often make for happiness.\r\n\r\nThe artist seemed to take a keen interest in Mrs. Straus. He quite\r\nembarrassed her by his constant staring, and after dinner sought an\r\nintroduction and sat next to her. Her plain hair-dress, smoothly brushed\r\nback and rolled in a coil behind, fascinated him. He remarked how\r\nnatural and becoming it was and wanted to know whether she always wore\r\nit that way; he wondered whether it would be as becoming any other way.\r\nHe wanted to know how long we should remain in Paris and expressed\r\nregret when told we were leaving in three or four days. Mrs. Straus\r\nfelt he had studied her head long enough to paint it from memory. And\r\nwho knows, perhaps he has used it in some painting that we have not yet\r\ndiscovered!\r\n\r\nAnother memorable dinner was at the home of Eli Lazard, of Lazard\r\nFreres, bankers, where we met Judge Wilson and daughters, of Cincinnati.\r\nAll of these hospitalities were very pleasant, but personally I should\r\nhave been glad to escape them, for the late hours, together with the\r\nrich cooking of Paris, were not in accord with my quiet habits and\r\nsimple tastes in food and drink.\r\n\r\nIn Vienna I called on our consul-general, Edmund Jussen, whose wife was\r\nthe sister of my esteemed friend Carl Schurz, which fact really prompted\r\nme to make the call. Jussen himself was not very admirable. He had much\r\nof the arrogance of a German official, so out of place in an American\r\nrepresentative. However, during our sojourn in the city he and his wife\r\nexchanged several visits with us. Mrs. Jussen did not much resemble her\r\ndistinguished brother, except for an expression about the eyes. She was\r\na very amiable woman with a good face. She told me much of her brother's\r\nchildhood and school years--how he had to struggle hard for his\r\neducation. Their father was a small shopkeeper, but no business man, and\r\nwas never able to make money. Carl did not earn money, but always\r\napplied himself diligently. This and much more that has since been\r\npublished about Schurz interested me greatly, of course.\r\n\r\nWe continued our journey to Varna on the Black Sea, there to take the\r\nsteamer for Constantinople. In those days there was no railway\r\nconnection with Constantinople. The Oriental Express went only to Varna,\r\nby way of Bucharest. On that particular part of our journey we got our\r\nfirst glimpses of the picturesque costumes of the Balkan district,\r\nespecially those of the men with their bare legs and flying shirts.\r\n\r\nThe trip from Varna to Constantinople was beautiful and inspiring. We\r\nboarded the boat at about four in the afternoon and retired early so as\r\nto be up by five or six next morning, when we passed through the\r\nBosphorus, round which clusters so much of classical memory. I suddenly\r\nrealized how much of my Homer I had forgotten--the Homer on whom I had\r\nspent years of hard study. However, most of us meet so many new subjects\r\nthat have a more direct relation to our surroundings that it is next to\r\nimpossible to get that \"elegant leisure\" necessary for a continued\r\ninterest in the classics.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the trip through the Bosphorus is quite like a dream. The\r\nhigh coast on both sides is covered with green, with here and there a\r\nhouse or some large huts; on one side is Europe and on the other side\r\nAsia, looking very much alike, bathed by the same sunshine, peaceful.\r\n\r\nWe sailed past Buyukdereh, Therapia, the summer residence of most of the\r\ndiplomats, about twelve miles from Constantinople, where the English,\r\nFrench, Austrian, and Russian embassies had magnificent palaces and the\r\nGermans were engaged in building; on past the lovely old towers of\r\nRoumeli-Hissar, built eight hundred years before, when first the Turks\r\nset foot in Europe, and back of this the tower of Robert College.\r\n\r\nSuddenly my ever-smiling and happy wife spied a launch flying a large\r\nUnited States flag at the stern. \"It's our launch!\" And sure enough,\r\nwhen we waved our handkerchiefs we discovered the members of my official\r\nfamily, who had come in the legation launch to meet us. There were\r\nPendleton King, acting charge d'affaires; Mr. Gargiulo, dragoman; J.\r\nLynch Pringle, consul-general; Mehmet, the _cavass_; and several clerks\r\nof the consulate and legation.\r\n\r\nThe _cavass_, by the way, is a sort of bodyguard. He walks before the\r\nminister, or rides on the box beside the driver, and serves the purpose\r\nof designating that the minister or ambassador follows. He carries two\r\nhuge pistols and a sword suspended from a gold belt, and his coat,\r\nsometimes red and sometimes blue, is much bebraided and embroidered. The\r\nnatives know each minister or ambassador by his _cavass_.\r\n\r\nOur first impression from the windows of the Royal Hotel in\r\nConstantinople was of picturesque dirt. As Mrs. Straus said at the time,\r\ndirt not only on the hard earth roads and the people, but even on the\r\ndogs. In time, however, one is less impressed by the dirt than by the\r\npicturesqueness--the venders calling out their wares of fish, fruit,\r\nmeat, vegetables, all carried on the edges of baskets covered with\r\nleaves; the water-carriers with their urns carried on yokes; and the\r\nveiled women.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nImmediately upon my arrival, of course, I communicated with His\r\nExcellency, Said Pasha, Minister of Foreign Affairs, to present my\r\ncredentials and arrange for an audience with His Majesty the Sultan,\r\nAbdul Hamid. The Pasha replied at once, appointing a time two days\r\nlater, and accordingly I went to the Sublime Porte, as the Turkish\r\nGovernment seat is called, in company with the charge and the dragoman\r\nor interpreter. That was about May 26th. Not until June 6th, however,\r\ndid I receive a communication from Munir Pasha, Grand Master of\r\nCeremonies, that His Majesty had named June 8th for my audience. The\r\nnext evening I received a telegram postponing the audience to the 10th.\r\nOn the 9th I received another communication, postponing it _sine die_.\r\nOn the 15th a new appointment was made for the 17th; then, between\r\nmidnight and one o'clock on the night of June 16th-17th, the personal\r\nsecretary of the Sultan came knocking at the door of my apartment, and,\r\nafter apologizing for his arrival at that untimely hour, informed me\r\nthat he had come at the Sultan's special request to say that word had\r\ncome from the Porte that June 17th was a most sacred day, a fact just\r\ndetermined by the phases of the moon, and the Sultan therefore was\r\nconstrained to postpone the audience again. The date was later set for\r\nJuly 1st, when I finally had my audience.\r\n\r\nIt was a peculiarity of Abdul Hamid to delay audiences to new\r\nrepresentatives for weeks and sometimes months by these successive\r\nappointments and postponements, to no other purpose than to impress the\r\nagents of foreign governments with the importance of His Majesty. In my\r\ncase there was some added cause: it was the month of Ramazan, during\r\nwhich only the most pressing official functions take place.\r\n\r\nRamazan, ninth month of the Turkish calendar, is a period of fasting.\r\nFor twenty-nine days every Mussulman abstains from food and water, and\r\neven smoking, from sunrise to sunset; which the rich arrange\r\nconveniently by sleeping all day and eating all night, while the poor\r\nwho have to work all day eat at sundown, at midnight, and very early in\r\nthe morning. The first meal after the fasting, at sunset, is called\r\n_iltar_. The fast is broken with Ramazan bread, a cakelike bread,\r\ncircular in shape, which we saw much in evidence at a bazaar in the\r\ncourtyard of a mosque at Stamboul, the more Oriental part of\r\nConstantinople, where the costumes of Greeks, Armenians, Turks, and\r\nArabs form a strange mixture indeed.\r\n\r\nDuring Beiram, a three days' feasting following Ramazan, the mosques\r\nare all illuminated at night, and the view over the water, with the\r\nmoving lights of boats in the foreground and the dimly lighted houses\r\nbeyond, interspersed with brightly illumined mosques, is quite like a\r\npicture of some enchanted land.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBecause of the Sultan's peculiarities in receiving foreign\r\nrepresentatives, the custom in regard to official calls at\r\nConstantinople is different from that at most capitals. Elsewhere calls\r\non colleagues are not made until after a minister or ambassador has had\r\nhis audience; but here usage dictated calling on one's colleagues as\r\nsoon as possible. Therefore I called first on Baron de Calice,\r\nambassador from Austria-Hungary and _doyen_ of the diplomatic corps. He\r\nreceived me with great cordiality and kindness, and advised me fully\r\nregarding diplomatic practices at Constantinople. And we were welcomed\r\nby each and all of my colleagues in turn, so that I found these calls\r\nvery much less disagreeable than I had anticipated; I even enjoyed many\r\nof them. At each visit coffee or tea was served, and generally\r\ncigarettes too, as is customary with the Turks, which is wonderfully\r\neffective in taking off the chill of diplomatic formalities. One soon\r\ngets to expect these refreshments; it is a delightful custom that might\r\nbe adopted in other places to advantage.\r\n\r\nAnother reason why these formal calls were less formidable than they\r\nmight have been was that three days after our arrival at the capital we\r\nwere invited to a garden party given by Lady White, wife of the British\r\nambassador, Sir William A. White. This served to give us a prompt\r\nintroduction to all my colleagues. In fact, in the five weeks\r\nintervening between our arrival and my audience, we had attended so many\r\ngarden parties and dinners given to us, that I found myself heartily\r\nlonging for respite. My natural inclination was to regard these social\r\ngatherings in the light of idle frivolities, especially in the summer,\r\nwhen one is supposed to be relatively free from functions of this kind;\r\nand I was not alone among my colleagues in preferring more evenings at\r\nhome to the occasional headaches that it cost to continue the very late\r\nhours these many engagements forced us to keep. Yet I could not\r\nconsistently decline invitations; such a course might have been\r\ninterpreted as a desire on my part to withdraw from the diplomatic\r\ncircle and would have interfered with the pleasant social relations it\r\nwas incumbent on me to cultivate. Attendance was really part of my duty,\r\nand in time I found these functions distinctly advantageous.\r\n\r\nWe looked forward with more than usual interest to the evening of our\r\ndinner at the Persian embassy. The Persian ambassador's wife had been a\r\nCircassian slave, whom he was said to have bought for L300 with a horse\r\nthrown into the bargain. The ambassador's wife was, of course, typically\r\nCircassian; chalky white skin, soft black eyes, small features, an\r\nunattractive figure unattractively dressed, with whom conversation was\r\nalmost nil because she knew only Persian.\r\n\r\nThe streets of Pera, the European part of Constantinople, are\r\nexceedingly narrow and very hilly, for the city is built on several\r\nhills, like ancient Rome; in addition they are poorly paved and dirty.\r\nThis makes driving dangerous and, as in mediaeval times, sedan chairs\r\nwere quite generally in use as a means of conveyance for the ladies of\r\nthe diplomatic corps and the wives of the higher Turkish officials,\r\nespecially at night to dinners and other official functions. Two sinewy\r\nporters carry these chairs, one in front and the other behind, and they\r\nshuffle along with considerable rapidity. Usually the lady is carried\r\nwhile the gentleman, preceded by his _cavass_ in the case of a diplomat,\r\nwalks alongside, except in inclement weather when he follows also in a\r\nchair. I am reminded of the wife of the German ambassador at the time, a\r\nlarge, heavy woman, whom the porters quite justly charged double. She,\r\nhowever, was entirely oblivious of her extra avoirdupois and always\r\ncomplained of the injustice of these porters! The Austrian and Russian\r\nembassies were particularly difficult of approach by conveyance other\r\nthan the sedan.\r\n\r\nWe certainly were living in a new sphere of life, in a strange land\r\namong strange people, with customs and habits that brought to mind the\r\nage of the patriarchs. There was much to see where some thirty\r\nnationalities lived and did business as if in their own homes--much to\r\nwonder at, much to deplore, much to praise and admire. The natives are a\r\npeculiar people, with many admirable characteristics; they are kind and\r\nhospitable, comparatively honest and reliable, especially the lower\r\nclasses, and they manifest a most sincere devotion to their religion.\r\nThe lower classes are poor, very poor; yet they are content and\r\nreasonably happy because their wants are few. Their poverty is not a\r\nsuffering condition and they seemed to be better off than the poor\r\nelsewhere. Their religion strictly interdicts the use of alcoholic\r\ndrinks, and as they are true to it and live faithfully up to its\r\nprinciples, they are spared all the evils that fall in the train of\r\ndrunkenness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MRS. STRAUS IN TURKEY]\r\n\r\nDuring the weeks that I waited for my audience with the Sultan I devoted\r\nmy time to studying in detail the various questions in regard to our\r\ndiplomatic relations, so that I might be better informed when they came\r\nup. This study was very interesting from an historical point of view,\r\nfor some of the questions were related to capitulations that dated as\r\nfar back as the fall of Constantinople in 1453. My legal training also\r\nproved valuable in enabling me to understand and handle matters.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn our first Friday in Constantinople we witnessed Selamlik, the\r\npicturesque ceremony held with great pomp every Friday, attending the\r\nSultan's going to the mosque. The Sultan's mosque is on the top of a\r\nhill commanding the most beautiful view of the city, from which can be\r\nseen the Bosphorus and, farther on, the Sea of Marmora. On the roads\r\nsurrounding the mosque as far as the eye could see were ranged ten or\r\nmore regiments of infantry and cavalry, each dressed in glittering\r\nuniforms according to the section of the empire from which they came,\r\nthe most resplendent being the Nubian and the Arabian. The Sultan\r\narrived in an open landau, and opposite him Osman Pasha, distinguished\r\nsoldier, hero of the Battle of Plevna in the Russo-Turkish War, and\r\nGrand Marshal of the Palace. The coachman was magnificently dressed in\r\nscarlet and gold, and following were the aides-de-camp, also beautifully\r\ndressed, one, an Armenian, all in white and gold. As the Sultan entered\r\nthe mosque a priest chanted a call to prayer which sounded not unlike\r\nthe old Hebrew chants in some of our synagogues. The mosque was so\r\ncrowded that we could see many Moslems kneeling and salaaming on the\r\nstreets outside the doors. The service lasted about twenty minutes,\r\nwhereupon the bands played and the Sultan reviewed his troops from one\r\nof the windows of the mosque. He then returned to the Palace in a\r\nbeautiful top phaeton drawn by two horses, which he drove himself, again\r\nwith Osman Pasha opposite, followed by his aides and the carriage that\r\nhad brought him. Usually several carriages, open and closed, also\r\nseveral saddle horses, are brought from the royal stables to the\r\nmosque, that the Sultan may take his choice for his return to the\r\nPalace.\r\n\r\nIt is expected as a display of good will that the ministers and\r\nambassadors occasionally attend this ceremony. It was practically the\r\nonly occasion on which Abdul Hamid appeared in public, for he constantly\r\nfeared assassination, and his expression showed his timidity. Following\r\nSelamlik he quite frequently arranged to receive in audience. In the\r\nkiosque or small house beside the mosque, there is a special suite of\r\nrooms reserved for the diplomatic corps. An aide informs the Sultan what\r\ndiplomatic representatives or other persons of distinction are at the\r\nkiosque, to each of whom His Majesty then sends some gracious message.\r\nWhile prayers are being said in the mosque, the guests at the kiosque\r\nare served coffee and cigarettes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne of the persons whom I met shortly after my arrival in the city was\r\nSir Henry Drummond Wolff, who was in Constantinople as Britain's special\r\nenvoy to negotiate a convention regarding the withdrawal of British\r\ntroops from Egypt. He had a suite at our hotel where we saw each other\r\nfrequently and became very good friends. Drummond Wolff, as he was\r\nusually spoken of to distinguish him from the several other prominent\r\nWolffs, was certainly a remarkable and clever man, and a great\r\n_raconteur_. He was then in his late fifties, had had wide experience as\r\na diplomat, and was thoroughly familiar with the Turkish temperament. In\r\nfact, he was at home in all that part of the world. He was born in\r\nMalta, the son of the famous missionary, Rev. Joseph Wolff, a Jew who\r\nbecame a convert first to Catholicism and then to Episcopalianism, being\r\nordained as priest in the Church of England. While in America he\r\nreceived the degree of Doctor of Theology from the College of St.\r\nJohn's, Annapolis, Maryland.\r\n\r\nSir Henry advised me in dealing with the Turkish authorities always to\r\nbe patient, pleasant, persistent. He also impressed upon me the\r\nimportance of maintaining the most cordial relations with my colleagues\r\nand of returning all hospitalities; that a well-disposed colleague can\r\noften be of incalculable assistance in inducing the authorities to\r\naccede to any proper demand one might have to make. However, his own\r\nrelations with the British ambassador, Sir William White, were not so\r\nfriendly. The estrangement between them was quite evident, caused no\r\ndoubt by personal jealousy, which is so likely to result between a\r\nspecial envoy and the regularly accredited representative of the same\r\ncountry in a given territory.\r\n\r\nWe stayed at the Royal only about ten days, and then moved to summer\r\nquarters in a hotel at Therapia, a name given to the district some three\r\nthousand years ago by the Greeks because of its healthful and balmy\r\nclimate. Here, too, Drummond Wolff had a neighboring suite, and later,\r\nwhen by reason of a longer stay than anticipated he was obliged to give\r\nup his apartment before he was ready, we put a portion of ours at his\r\ndisposal, which he much appreciated. It was a very pleasant arrangement,\r\nand diplomatically no less profitable. We dined together every evening,\r\nand often in our party were also Prince Ghika, Roumanian charge, and the\r\nPrincess; Baron Van Tetz, Dutch minister, and the Baroness. The Baron\r\nwas later accredited to Berlin, and then made Minister of Foreign\r\nAffairs in his own country. He has now retired and at this writing he\r\nand the Baroness still live at The Hague. They are charming people.\r\n\r\nOn June 21, 1887, the entire diplomatic corps was present in official\r\ndress at services in the English chapel, in honor of the Queen's\r\nJubilee. The chaplain of the English embassy, the Reverend George\r\nWashington, officiated. He said he was of the same family as our own\r\nGeorge Washington.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe day before my audience I presided at the commencement exercises of\r\nRobert College at Roumeli-Hissar, by invitation of the venerable\r\npresident, Dr. George Washburn. The college in 1887 had about one\r\nhundred and eighty students, mainly Bulgarians, Greeks, and Armenians,\r\nwith two or three Turks. The commencement was quite similar to those at\r\nhome, except that the orations were delivered in the various languages\r\nof the East as well as in French and English.\r\n\r\nI took this first occasion to refer in a larger way to the aims and\r\npurposes of Robert College and similar American institutions. The Turks\r\nhad not been able to understand the benevolence that prompted the\r\nestablishment of schools and colleges by Americans throughout the\r\nempire. They were suspicious, and their attitude was founded on\r\nexperiences with various institutions and societies of several of the\r\nother nations, notably the Greeks, who, under guise of scientific and\r\nbenevolent activity, had fostered political design. The Turks believed\r\nthat behind our institutions lay a purpose inimical to the sovereignty\r\nof Turkey, a belief stimulated by Russia and by some of the French\r\nCatholics, who were opposed to the extended use of the English language\r\nand the influence of Protestant English and American ideas in the East.\r\nThis gave rise to many of the vexatious questions that the legation had\r\nto solve. By way of throwing some oil upon these troubled waters,\r\ntherefore, I said, during my address:\r\n\r\n     For centuries the tide of progress and civilization has been making\r\n     its way toward the West. Its course has been marked by blood and\r\n     carnage. The history of the Middle Ages and of modern times\r\n     chronicles the nations and empires that have sunk in this mighty\r\n     current, and the new life and new civilization that have sprung up\r\n     over the ruins of the old. That flood tide, pushing its\r\n     irresistible course onward, still swept on, until in our day it\r\n     mingled its waters with the Great Pacific Ocean. The Ultima Thule\r\n     having at last been reached, the great ebb-tide began to course its\r\n     way backward; and America, the youngest of nations, in gratitude\r\n     for all the past, as a token of her amity and her friendship, has\r\n     sent back on the advance current of this return tide not ships of\r\n     war nor armed troops, but her most cherished institutions, a fully\r\n     equipped American college.\r\n\r\n     So that here, to-day, on the beautiful and picturesque shores of\r\n     the classic Bosphorus, on the very spot where the nations of the\r\n     East four and a half centuries ago erected and left the\r\n     well-preserved monument of their passage to the West, stands Robert\r\n     College. What a tale and what a history! Robert College here and\r\n     the Towers of Roumeli-Hissar there! The one the fortified remains\r\n     of bygone wars, the other the tranquil emblem of returning peace.\r\n     What a double tale do these two institutions speak to one another!\r\n     The tie that unites them is one of love and peace, a league more\r\n     puissant than army or navy for the welfare and happiness of\r\n     nations. When centuries shall have rolled by and another Gibbon\r\n     shall come to write of empires, may it be his privilege to record\r\n     no longer the decline and fall, but the rise and rejuvenation of\r\n     this Orient to which we look with affection.\r\n\r\nAnd now that I had been received and entertained by about everybody in\r\nConstantinople, it was time for my audience with the Sultan, who came\r\nlast like the prima donna. Official functions at Yildis Palace, as the\r\nSultan's residence is called (Yildis meaning star), were always most\r\ndignified and punctilious. Royal carriages were sent from the Palace\r\nwith escorts for myself and staff. At the entrance to the Palace we were\r\nmet by the Introducer of Ambassadors; then we proceeded to the salon of\r\nthe Grand Master of Ceremonies, where I was met by the Minister of\r\nForeign Affairs and conducted by Osman Pasha, Grand Marshal, into the\r\npresence of His Majesty.\r\n\r\nThe Sultan was standing ready to receive me. He was a small man, of\r\nrather spare frame, sallow complexion, dark eyes that sparkled with a\r\nfurtive expression, prominent aquiline nose, and short full black beard\r\nwhich later, when it turned gray, he dyed reddish with henna. He had on\r\na black frock coat that buttoned to the neck.\r\n\r\nAccording to custom I handed him the letters of recall of my\r\npredecessor, then presented my credentials, and made a brief address, a\r\ncopy of which in writing I left with him. It read as follows:\r\n\r\n     The President of the United States has been pleased to charge me\r\n     with the distinguished honor and agreeable duty of cultivating to\r\n     the fullest extent the friendship which has so happily subsisted\r\n     between the two Governments, and of conveying to Your Imperial\r\n     Majesty the assurances of his best wishes for the welfare of Your\r\n     Imperial Majesty and for the prosperity of Turkey.\r\n\r\n     As the faithful representative of my Government, charged with the\r\n     duty of protecting the interests of her citizens, permit me to\r\n     express the hope that Your Imperial Majesty's Government will lend\r\n     me its kindly aid in the efforts I shall at all times make to\r\n     maintain and further cement a good understanding for the\r\n     development of the relations of amity and friendship between the\r\n     two Governments, and that the same courtesy and cordiality may be\r\n     shown me which were so generously accorded to my honored\r\n     predecessors.\r\n\r\n     The time has at last come, through the progress of science, when\r\n     all nations by reason of the facility and rapidity of communication\r\n     have been brought nearer together, so that their mutual interests\r\n     and relations verily entitle them to be called one great family.\r\n\r\n     In the spirit of that relationship I have come to dwell near the\r\n     Government of Your Imperial Majesty, and to greet you in behalf of\r\n     and in the words of our Chief Magistrate as his \"Great and Good\r\n     Friend,\" with the hope \"that God may have Your Imperial Majesty in\r\n     His wise keeping.\"\r\n\r\nWhich is the customary language of such documents, with the exception of\r\nthe third paragraph. His Majesty replied in a brief address, expressing\r\nhis pleasure in receiving me. He then sat down and bade me do likewise,\r\nwhereupon we were served with cigarettes and Turkish coffee, the latter\r\nin egg-shaped cups resting in jewel-studded holders. The Sultan speaks\r\nonly Turkish, and I spoke English, so we understood one another by means\r\nof the dragoman, Mr. Gargiulo, who had been for twenty years the very\r\nable Turkish adviser and interpreter of the legation and remained at\r\nthat post for ten years thereafter.\r\n\r\nThe audience concluded, we returned to the legation in the same stately\r\nfashion we had come, following which we gave a reception to the American\r\ncolony, composed almost exclusively of the missionaries resident in\r\nConstantinople, together with the president and faculty of Robert\r\nCollege and of the Home School for Girls, then located at Scutari,\r\nacross the Bosphorus. I was now ready for the official business of my\r\nmission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nFIRST TURKISH MISSION\r\n\r\n     Turkey's jealousy of foreigners--My protest against the closing of\r\n     American mission schools--Diplomacy prevents drastic regulations\r\n     proposed by Turkey--The schools are reopened--Defending the sale of\r\n     the Bible--A cargo of missionaries and rum--Robert College--A visit\r\n     to Cairo--\"Bombe a la Lincoln\"--Governmental reforms in Egypt--My\r\n     protest against persecution of Jews in flight from Russia and\r\n     Roumania--At Jerusalem--Huge delegation of Jews pleads with me for\r\n     release of imprisoned relatives--I make drastic demands, and\r\n     prisoners are promptly released--Their grateful memorial to\r\n     me--Rights of American citizens on Turkish soil--Disputes regarding\r\n     our Treaty of 1830--Uncle Sam gives $10,800 worth of presents to\r\n     Turkish officials, on conclusion of a treaty--Diplomatic tangles;\r\n     United States left without Treaty of Naturalization with\r\n     Turkey--Baron de Hirsch, international celebrity--I am invited to\r\n     arbitrate his dispute with the Sultan, and am offered an honorarium\r\n     of 1,000,000 francs--I decline honorarium, but offer to\r\n     mediate--Baroness de Hirsch's philanthropies--American capitalists\r\n     consider Turkish railway concessions--Sultan grants permission for\r\n     American excavation in Babylon--My resignation in 1888--The\r\n     Sultan's farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor several years the Turks had been very jealous of foreigners,\r\nespecially in Asia Minor, and the result was many restrictions which\r\nmanifested themselves in a variety of relations. The growth of the\r\nmission schools and their increase in number quite naturally enhanced\r\nthe suspicion of the authorities, with the help, as I have mentioned, of\r\nthose whose interests were served in helping the Turks to see danger in\r\nthis growth of our institutions.\r\n\r\nAt the legation the interests of the American missionaries with regard\r\nto their schools and their printed matter formed the major portion of\r\nthe affairs requiring my immediate attention. About four hundred schools\r\nhad been established in Turkey by the Presbyterian and Congregational\r\nmissionary boards. Beginning with the winter of 1885, upon one pretext\r\nor another, thirty of these schools in Syria were closed, many of the\r\nteachers arrested and forbidden ever to teach in the country again,\r\nwhile the parents were threatened with fine and imprisonment if they\r\ncontinued to send their children to American schools. With few\r\nexceptions all the teachers and parents were natives and Turkish\r\nsubjects. The official reason given for the closing of these schools was\r\nthat their boards had not complied with the Turkish law requiring that\r\ntextbooks, curriculums, and certificates of the teachers be submitted to\r\nthe authorities for examination; although the missionary representatives\r\ngave assurance that these requirements had been met.\r\n\r\nSoon after my audience with the Sultan I took up the subject of these\r\nschools with the Grand Vizier, Kiamil Pasha, who was perhaps the most\r\nenlightened statesman of the Turkish Empire. Mr. King, while acting\r\ncharge, had made an agreement with the Minister of Public Instruction\r\nwhereby the missionaries at these schools were to submit the textbooks\r\nand other documentary equipment to the local authorities. I protested to\r\nthe Grand Vizier against the closing of the schools, and after some\r\nweeks we reached an understanding: he was to telegraph the vali or\r\ngovernor-general at Syria that the schools were to be allowed to reopen\r\nupon their compliance with the law, according to an arrangement between\r\nhimself and myself. The outcome looked hopeful, though months dragged\r\nalong without further result.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, and quite by accident, I learned that the Porte had\r\nformulated proposed additional regulations concerning all foreign\r\nschools, and that these regulations were about to be submitted to the\r\nCouncil of Ministers to be made law. I immediately requested a copy from\r\nthe Grand Vizier. I found, to my surprise, that the regulations were\r\ncalculated to place insuperable obstacles in the way of every foreign\r\nschool in the empire. Among other things, in addition to the requirement\r\nthat textbooks, curriculums, and teachers' certificates be submitted for\r\nexamination, all schools were to obtain an irade or express sanction of\r\nthe Sultan in order to function. Failing to receive that irade within\r\nsix months from the date of the law embodying the new regulations, the\r\nauthorities in the several provinces were commanded to close such\r\nschools.\r\n\r\nI communicated my discovery to those of my colleagues who were\r\ninterested with me in this dispute: Count de Montebello, French\r\nambassador; Baron Blanc, Italian ambassador; and Sir William White,\r\nBritish ambassador. At the same time I submitted copies of the proposed\r\nregulations to the Reverend Doctor Isaac Bliss and the Reverend Henry O.\r\nDwight, of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions in\r\nWestern Turkey. They all viewed the matter as I did.\r\n\r\nThe following day I again called on the Grand Vizier, informing him that\r\nI looked upon these regulations as seriously infringing upon the rights\r\nof American citizens in Turkey, and pointing out my objections in\r\ndetail. The three colleagues just referred to did the same on behalf of\r\ntheir respective subjects who had mission or other schools in the\r\nempire. We succeeded in impressing the Grand Vizier with the force and\r\nvalidity of our objections, for he requested us to put them in writing\r\nand forward them to the Porte. With the aid of Drs. Bliss and Dwight I\r\nprepared such a document, and I am glad to be able to say that our\r\nprotests came in time and were sufficiently forceful to prove effective\r\nin preventing this new legislation.\r\n\r\nAs I had now been negotiating for several months with reference to the\r\nSyrian schools, I decided that the most efficient way of translating\r\ninto concrete result the repeated promises in regard to them was to\r\nvisit some of our missionary schools throughout the empire. I obtained\r\nthe necessary permission from Washington and took a journey to Cairo,\r\nJaffa, Jerusalem, Beirut, Mersina, and Smyrna, where I conferred with\r\nour missionaries, with our several consuls, as well as with the\r\nrespective governors and governor-generals. I found the relations\r\nbetween the local authorities and our consuls, and between the\r\nauthorities and the missionary representatives, quite friendly, in some\r\nplaces indifferent, but nowhere hostile.\r\n\r\nI had instructed the missionaries to get ready for the opening of the\r\nschools, and I planned the trip so as to be in Beirut about the time my\r\norder for the reopening was to be put in force. My plan had the desired\r\neffect. In anticipation of my arrival at Beirut, fifteen of the schools\r\nwere reopened; and while I was there five or six more. That was about as\r\nmany of the total thirty as the missionaries cared to or were in a\r\nposition to reopen then. For the time being I felt satisfied that I had\r\nsufficiently reversed the Government policy to check the progressive\r\nclosing of the schools which, if continued, would seriously have\r\nthreatened the existence of all American schools in Turkey.\r\n\r\nI must here express my appreciation of the assistance given me by Erhard\r\nBissinger, our consul at Beirut. He was an earnest, sincere man,\r\nformerly a New York merchant. Although his health was frail he worked\r\nwith unremitting zeal and efficiency, discharging his official duties\r\nwith rare judgment and tact. I could always rely on the correctness of\r\nhis reports respecting the many difficulties as they arose, and I could\r\nalways feel assured that in each instance he would apply every effort to\r\nbring about an adjustment with the local authorities, by whom he was as\r\nhighly esteemed as by the missionaries.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother expression of the Government's enmity toward the activities of\r\nour missionaries was the treatment being accorded the colporteurs, or\r\npersons who went about selling Bible tracts. The agents of the American\r\nas well as the British Bible Society were constantly and arbitrarily\r\nbeing arrested. They were charged with plying their trade without\r\nlicense, yet when they made application they were never able to get\r\nlicense. From time to time I protested against these arrests and secured\r\nthe release of one after another of the agents; but the thing to be done\r\nwas to prevent arrests.\r\n\r\nThe fact was they were being made without real cause. Before these\r\ntracts or any other material could be printed a permit had to be\r\nobtained from the Ottoman Government. The material had to pass\r\ncensorship before it was allowed to be printed, so that the very fact of\r\nits appearing in print was proof of the authorization of the censors. I\r\nheld that, once printed, to prohibit the sale of these tracts was in\r\nrestraint of commerce; that there was no reason why book hawkers should\r\nbe under different regulations from hawkers of any other wares.\r\n\r\nI prepared an argument along these lines, which I presented to the Grand\r\nVizier, and he agreed with my conclusions. He forthwith gave orders for\r\nthe release of all colporteurs and that no further arrests were to be\r\nmade. The British Bible Society, of course, benefited equally with our\r\nown by these orders, and I received their grateful appreciation through\r\nmy colleague, Sir William White.\r\n\r\nAll this hostility toward the missionaries and their work might be\r\nconstrued to be founded upon an objection by the Government to having\r\nits subjects converted to Christianity. But it was rather foreign\r\ninfluence as a whole that was being fought, and religion was simply the\r\nconvenient peg. Conversions from Mohammedanism were few and far between,\r\nand for the number of Mohammedans turned Christian in the course of a\r\nyear there were as many Christians turned Mohammedan. The Mohammedans\r\nare intensely and sincerely devoted to their faith. On the whole they\r\nare convinced that their religion is the only true one and that\r\nChristianity is inferior and less rational. Such converts as the\r\nmissionaries do make come almost exclusively from among the Armenians,\r\nSyrians, Greeks, Maronites, and other Christian sects whose form of\r\nChristianity is of a mediaeval character. The chief missionary work in\r\nTurkey is educational, carried forward in a religious spirit. At the\r\ntime of my visit to the various vilayets, the Presbyterian Board alone\r\nhad over one hundred schools throughout Syria, all located in places\r\nwhere previously there had been no schools at all.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMany of the men who carried forward missionary work had consecrated\r\ntheir whole lives to it. Chief among these were Rev. Henry H. Jessup,\r\nvenerable patriarch of the Presbyterian missionaries; Rev. Daniel Bliss,\r\npresident of the Syrian Protestant College; and Dr. George Washburn,\r\npresident of Robert College.\r\n\r\nDr. Jessup and Dr. Bliss had started for the field together in 1856,\r\nwhen, in bleak December, they both left Boston in the sailing vessel\r\nSultana, which, according to Dr. Jessup's autobiography, \"Fifty-Three\r\nYears in Syria,\" carried in addition to nine or ten missionaries a cargo\r\nof New England rum to Smyrna--a cargo spirited no less than spiritual.\r\n\r\nDr. Bliss was succeeded in 1902 by his distinguished son, Rev. Howard S.\r\nBliss, who conducted with renewed vigor the work of his father,\r\nenlarging the scope and curriculum of the college so that through its\r\nthousands of graduates in the arts, in science, and in medicine it\r\nbecame a potent force throughout the whole Near East. During my\r\nsubsequent missions to Turkey I became very intimate with the younger\r\nBliss, and during the Peace Conference in 1919, when he was in Paris in\r\nbehalf of Syria, I was able to continue this intimacy. Unfortunately in\r\nParis he was already suffering from a serious malady which resulted in\r\nhis death in America the year following. He was honored, respected, and\r\nbeloved in both the old world and the new.\r\n\r\nDr. Washburn was a man of statesmanship as well as erudition. His book\r\nof recollections, \"Fifty Years in Constantinople,\" is valuable for the\r\nlight it throws on political issues in Turkey no less than on questions\r\neducational and religious. He was recognized as an authority on Turkish\r\nand Balkan affairs, and the influence of the college was by no means\r\nlimited to the Turkish Empire; it was felt quite as much throughout the\r\nBalkan States. Bulgaria at one period was largely governed by officials\r\nwho had been graduated from Robert College, and they looked to Dr.\r\nWashburn as their chief adviser. The British ambassador at\r\nConstantinople frequently consulted him and was swayed by his advice,\r\nfor Dr. Washburn understood the Turks and spoke their language. He was\r\nthe second president of the college, having succeeded his father-in-law,\r\nthe Reverend Cyrus Hamlin, D.D.\r\n\r\nOn the faculty of Robert College were a number of other very able men:\r\nDr. Albert L. Long, Professor of Natural Science, distinguished as an\r\narchaeologist as well, was a man of engaging personality. He had a large\r\nacquaintance among the learned Turks, whose estimate of our country was\r\nmaterially influenced for the good by their association with him. Then\r\nthere was Dr. Edwin A. Grosvenor, Professor of Latin and History, who\r\nresigned shortly afterward to accept a professorship at Amherst. He was\r\nthen at work on his scholarly \"History of Constantinople,\" which I\r\nconsider the best and most reliable work on that subject.\r\n\r\nIn 1888 I secured for Robert College, after arduous negotiation,\r\npermission for the erection of two new buildings, one a house for the\r\npresident and the other an addition to the college itself. When the\r\npermits came through there was no mention of the addition to the\r\ncollege, and as work on it meanwhile had been begun, no little anxiety\r\nensued. It developed that some one on the staff of the Grand Vizier had\r\nbeen bribed by an enemy of the college to tamper with the permits.\r\nHowever, because of the good relationship between Kiamil Pasha and\r\nmyself, he acknowledged this bit of chicanery and duly rectified it.\r\n\r\nI might add that in numerous instances I was able to arrange\r\nunofficially with the Grand Vizier matters which threatened to become\r\nmore or less troublesome. This method of negotiating was peculiarly\r\nadvantageous at the Porte, where delays were proverbial and so\r\nfrequently defeated official action. Again, some of the difficulty\r\nexperienced by my colleagues in getting proper redress for violations,\r\neven gross violations, was due to the fact that the Porte was not always\r\nable to control the governor-generals of the provinces.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have said that my trip among our missionary schools included a visit\r\nto Cairo. At that time Egypt was still under Turkish sovereignty and\r\nquestions of larger importance had to be taken up with the Sublime\r\nPorte. Thus American questions came under my jurisdiction as envoy\r\nextraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to the empire. Our\r\nrepresentative at Cairo, John Cardwell, had the title of consul-general\r\nand diplomatic agent, and had to receive his exequatur from the Sublime\r\nPorte. He was a conscientious and capable official who had been there\r\nsince the beginning of the first Cleveland Administration.\r\n\r\nOn this trip also I saw much of Anthony M. Keiley and his charming wife;\r\nI have spoken of him in a previous chapter as having been rejected for\r\nthe post of United States minister by Austria-Hungary. Keiley was\r\nserving as one of the American judges of the Mixed or Reform Tribunal at\r\nCairo and was highly respected for his ability at this international\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\nMohammed Tewfik, son of the extravagant Ismail of Suez Canal fame, whom\r\nhe succeeded, was Khedive of Egypt and entertained us during our visit.\r\nHe was only thirty-six years old, and without his fez might have been\r\ntaken for an Englishman. He spoke fluent English and his conversation\r\nshowed him to be well informed regarding the governments and peoples of\r\nEurope. Within an hour after my first call upon him he called with his\r\naide-de-camp upon me at the Hotel Shepheard. He wanted to decorate me,\r\nbut I informed his aide that under our system we did not permit\r\ndiplomatic representatives to accept such distinctions; so the next day\r\nhe sent a lesser decoration to the manager of the hotel, which, it was\r\nsaid, he did in my honor.\r\n\r\nA few days later we were invited to lunch with him, and there were also\r\npresent a number of higher officials. The menu consisted of dishes with\r\nsuch improvised names as \"crevettes a l'Americaine,\" \"bombe a la\r\nLincoln,\" etc. One dish that made a deep impression upon my\r\nnone-too-keen gastronomic memory was the delicious Egyptian quail, which\r\nis larger and plumper than our own. In season the birds migrate from the\r\nnorth and are trapped in great numbers. They could be bought in the\r\nmarkets for a piaster, or less than five cents.\r\n\r\nI had frequent conferences with Nubar Pasha, Egypt's foremost statesman.\r\nHe was an Armenian educated by Jesuits in France. His knowledge was\r\nextensive, and he combined the enlightened viewpoint of a European\r\nstatesman of the first rank with all the subtlety of an Oriental. It was\r\nhe who conceived the plan of introducing a legal system and good\r\ngovernment in Egypt, and creating the mixed tribunals or international\r\nlaw courts. In the reorganization of Egypt he acted in sympathy with\r\nLord Dufferin's programme and consequently was highly regarded by the\r\nBritish.\r\n\r\nWith Sir Evelyn Baring, British agent and consul-general in Egypt,\r\nafterwards Lord Cromer, I had a pleasant conversation. He was then at\r\nthe height of his power in the reconstruction of Egypt. Major-General\r\nSir Francis Grenfell, sirdar or commanding general of the Egyptian army,\r\nis another memory in connection with that visit.\r\n\r\nI regretted that time did not permit my going up the Nile; but like\r\nevery one with an historical imagination I was immensely impressed with\r\nthe grandeur and massive beauty of the pyramids and the classic ruins of\r\nancient Egypt, which with their five thousand or more years of existence\r\nhave outdistanced all other relics in bringing the handiwork of man down\r\nthrough ages of devastating time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was a matter pending at Jerusalem regarding which our Secretary of\r\nState had instructed me, and which I thought best to look into\r\npersonally while on this trip. Foreign Jews were being expelled simply\r\nbecause of their race, and American Jews were being discriminated\r\nagainst along with those of other nations. In the background of this\r\naction by Turkey were Russia and Roumania, for since the days of the\r\nSpanish Inquisition the Ottoman authorities, with rare exceptions, had\r\nbeen not only tolerant but hospitable to Jewish immigrants. Roumania,\r\ncontrary to express provisions of the Treaty of Berlin guaranteeing\r\nequal political and civil rights to all subjects in this newly created\r\nprincipality, placed restrictions upon her Jewish subjects, causing a\r\nlarge number to emigrate. And from Russia, following the enforcement of\r\nthe Ignatieff laws of 1882 (some of them laws that had been on the\r\nstatute books unenforced for years), there was also a wholesale exodus\r\nof persecuted Jews. Most of these people went to America, but some to\r\nother countries, including Palestine.\r\n\r\nIt was the irony of persecution that the Russians who came to Turkey\r\nwere claimed as subjects by Russia, which entered a protest at the Porte\r\nagainst making them Ottoman subjects. On the other hand, the Russian\r\nPatriarch in Turkey and the dignitaries of the Roman Church objected to\r\nthe settlement of foreign Jews in Palestine. This pressure from powers\r\nthat Turkey wished to please brought forth the promulgation of a law\r\ninterdicting all Jews from coming to Palestine for permanent residence.\r\nBesides those from Russia and Roumania, there were a few Jews coming\r\nfrom England and France. And there were a very few coming from\r\nAmerica--naturalized citizens.\r\n\r\nAt the Porte I had taken this matter up with the Grand Vizier. He told\r\nme that a regulation was communicated to the Imperial authorities at\r\nJerusalem limiting the stay of foreign Jews there to one month. Later he\r\ntold me that the Council of Ministers was about to change this limit to\r\nthree months. He gave as reasons for the existence of any such\r\nregulations, first, that at certain times of the year, Easter, for\r\nexample, religious fanaticism was at so high a pitch that Jews had to\r\nremain in their houses to escape attack and perhaps murder at the hands\r\nof the Christians. In the second place, it had been reported that the\r\nJews of all the world were planning to strengthen themselves in and\r\naround Jerusalem with a view to re-establishing their ancient kingdom at\r\nsome future time.\r\n\r\nI answered that of course the first reason could be done away with by a\r\nstrong force of police. As for the second, if the Porte would make\r\ninquiry it could satisfy itself that there was no such plan among the\r\nJews of the world, that the immigration was caused by the persecution in\r\nRussia and Roumania. (This was nine years before the publication of the\r\npamphlet, in 1896, by Dr. Hertzl, from which generated modern Zionism. I\r\nshall speak of Dr. Hertzl later.) So far as the American Jews were\r\nconcerned, I informed the Grand Vizier that it was a fundamental\r\nprinciple of our Government to make no distinction of race or creed\r\namong our citizens, and that we had consistently denied to foreign\r\nnations that right over our citizens, as the provisions in our treaties\r\nwith the Ottoman Empire showed. To all of this the Grand Vizier replied\r\nsimply that should any American be expelled he would carefully consider\r\nmy arguments and give instructions accordingly.\r\n\r\nOn communicating with our consul-general at Jerusalem, Henry Gillman, I\r\nlearned that he had taken the same position, and that to date no\r\nAmerican citizen had been expelled; also that the American consulate was\r\nthe only one which had refused aid to the authorities in the expulsion\r\nof foreign Jews, and our representative was not being made very\r\ncomfortable for this non-cooperation with the local government. Here the\r\nmatter stood when I left Constantinople.\r\n\r\nThere were a number of other vexatious questions pending between the\r\nvali at Jerusalem and Mr. Gillman, and I deemed it good policy to show\r\nmy resentment to the vali for his arbitrary methods. I declined the\r\ncourtesy of the official conveyance with which he sent one of his aides\r\nto Jaffa to meet me and my family and take us to Jerusalem. We took a\r\nCook's conveyance, stopped overnight at Ramleh, and next day drove over\r\nthe hills of Judea to Jerusalem, where Mr. Gillman conducted us to\r\ncomfortable quarters at a hotel outside the walls.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nScarcely had I arrived at the hotel when a huge delegation of Jews, men\r\nand women, some with infants in their arms, came to plead with me to\r\nobtain the release of relatives and friends who had been put in prison\r\nby the vali or governor because they had come to settle there. I had\r\nknown of the troubled conditions in Jerusalem because of the immigration\r\nof the Jews; but until my arrival there I was not aware of the\r\nimprisonment of these people. More than four hundred of them were being\r\nheld in prison awaiting deportation.\r\n\r\nInstead of calling on the vali as ordinarily would have been proper, I\r\nsent a note to him through the consul demanding the immediate release of\r\nthe immigrants who, I claimed, were being imprisoned contrary to our\r\ntreaty as well as the treaties of Great Britain, France, and other\r\npowers; I said that I should decline to call upon him until this\r\ninjustice was righted by such release; and that, further, unless my\r\nrequest was promptly complied with I should appeal to the Sublime Porte\r\nfor his removal.\r\n\r\nI felt authorized to take so drastic a step by reason of the\r\nnegotiations I had had with the Grand Vizier and in view of our treaty\r\nand the treaties of several of the powers I have referred to. I obtained\r\nthe desired result. The vali communicated my message to the Porte, and\r\nthe Grand Vizier instructed him to comply with my request. Within\r\ntwenty-four hours all the prisoners were released.\r\n\r\nThe following morning there was a delegation of several thousand people\r\noutside my hotel, who had come to express their gratitude. They\r\npresented me with a beautifully embossed memorial, the text of which,\r\ntranslated, reads:\r\n\r\n     With delight of soul we bring to thee, O Sir, glory of our people,\r\n     the blessing of our community, the congregations of Israel dwelling\r\n     in Zion and in all the cities of the Holy Land,\r\n\r\n                            THE BLESSING OF MAZZOL TOV\r\n                                       (good fortune)\r\n\r\n     because the Lord God of Israel has raised thee to fame and glory\r\n     and has given to thee a seat of honor among the mighty of the\r\n     earth. And we lift our hands to the Holy Sanctuary (praying) that\r\n     thy horn be exalted with honor and splendor, and that thou be given\r\n     the strength and the power to exalt the horn of Israel, thy people,\r\n     to speak in their favor before the throne of the Government--may\r\n     its glory increase!--and that thou continue in thy honored office\r\n     for many days, until he (the messiah) shall come unto Shiloh \"and\r\n     unto him shall the obedience of the people be\"--soon, in our days,\r\n     amen!\r\n\r\n     Such is the blessing of those who respect and honor thee in\r\n     accordance with thy high and exalted station.\r\n\r\n     The leaders of the Jews in Jerusalem--may it be built and\r\n     established in our days!\r\n\r\nIt is signed with the seals and signatures of Rafail Meir Panisel (Haham\r\nBashi), chief rabbi of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews in Jerusalem, and\r\nSamuel Salant, chief rabbi of the Ashkenazim, Perushim, and Hasidim in\r\nJerusalem.\r\n\r\nNow I called upon the vali, who received me very graciously and with\r\ngreat courtesy. I thanked him for his prompt compliance with my request,\r\nand expressed the hope that, inasmuch as I had an understanding with the\r\nPorte that no discrimination was to be made against Jewish immigrants to\r\nJerusalem, I should not in future have to complain of any infringement\r\nupon this understanding, otherwise I should again be compelled to take\r\ndrastic action. I called his attention to the treaties referred to, of\r\nwhich he had had no previous knowledge.\r\n\r\nI stopped to make some official calls, accompanied by the consul and his\r\nstaff. As is customary when high officials go through the streets of the\r\nHoly City, several halberdiers of the vali preceded, to give distinction\r\nto the party as well as protection and a clear passage through the\r\ncrowds. I could remain in Jerusalem only three or four days, however,\r\nfor I had to catch the steamer that stopped at Alexandretta and Smyrna,\r\nwhere I wanted to confer with our consuls.\r\n\r\nUpon my return to Constantinople my French and British colleagues were\r\nmuch pleased at my having secured the release of the Jewish immigrants\r\nin Palestine. They had received, through their foreign offices,\r\nexpressions of appreciation and grateful acknowledgment from such\r\norganizations as the Anglo-Jewish Association of London, and the\r\nAlliance Israelite of Paris.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TESTIMONIAL GIVEN TO MR. STRAUS IN JERUSALEM IN\r\nAPPRECIATION OF THE RELEASE OF SEVERAL HUNDRED PRISONERS]\r\n\r\nThe next step in the development of this question was a communication\r\nreceived by our State Department from Mavroyeni Bey, Turkish minister at\r\nWashington, informing the Department of a change, indeed, of the time\r\nlimit from one month to three for the sojourn of Jews in Jerusalem, with\r\nthe proviso, however, \"that they are going to Jerusalem in the\r\nperformance of a pilgrimage, and not for the purpose of engaging in\r\ncommerce or taking up their residence there.\"\r\n\r\nThis communication was received while I was on my trip, and Secretary\r\nBayard forwarded it to me with the instruction that I take up the\r\nsubject with the Ottoman Government as follows:\r\n\r\n     To require of applicants for passports, which under our laws are\r\n     issued to all citizens upon the sole evidence of their citizenship,\r\n     any announcement of their religious faith or declaration of their\r\n     personal motives in seeking such passports, would be utterly\r\n     repugnant to the spirit of our institutions and to the intent of\r\n     the solemn proscription forever by the Constitution of any\r\n     religious test as a qualification of the relations of the citizen\r\n     to the Government, and would, moreover, assume an inquisitorial\r\n     function in respect of the personal affairs of the individual,\r\n     which this Government can not exert for its own purposes, and could\r\n     still less assume to exercise with the object of aiding a foreign\r\n     Government in the enforcement of an objectionable and arbitrary\r\n     discrimination against certain of our citizens.\r\n\r\n     Our adherence to these principles has been unwavering since the\r\n     foundation of our Government, and you will be at no loss to cite\r\n     pertinent examples of our consistent defense of religious liberty,\r\n     which, as I said in my note to Baron Schaeffer of May 18, 1885, in\r\n     relation to the Keiley episode at Vienna, \"is the chief\r\n     corner-stone of the American system of Government, and provisions\r\n     for its security are embedded in the written charter and interwoven\r\n     in the moral fabric of its laws.\"\r\n\r\nI received this upon my return. Secretary Bayard asked me also to\r\nascertain the views of my colleagues respecting this irade, and I found\r\nthem willing and ready to take it up with the Porte in a manner similar\r\nto the instructions I had received.\r\n\r\nI called on Said Pasha and left with him a note in accordance with my\r\ninstructions, and I sent a copy of this note to the French and British\r\nambassadors. They in turn each advised the Ministry that they could not\r\nadmit of regulations prejudicial to the existing rights of their\r\nsubjects as secured by treaties. And here for a time the matter rested.\r\n\r\nSeveral months later three American Jews were expelled from Jerusalem\r\nbecause they had not left the city at the expiration of three months,\r\nand again the question had to be taken up with the Porte. This time Said\r\nPasha replied that the restrictions with regard to the three Americans\r\nhad been ordered withdrawn, \"the Sublime Porte having lately decided\r\nthat the measure concerning the Israelites going to Palestine shall not\r\nbe applied but to those who emigrate in number (_en nombre_), and that\r\nno obstacle shall be opposed to the sojourn of those who are not in this\r\nclass.\"\r\n\r\nThis, like most other questions that arose between the Ottoman\r\nGovernment and our own, could not be settled for any length of time by\r\nprinciple, law, or treaty. Such documents might be used as reminders of\r\nagreements once reached, but in Turkey they do not of themselves direct\r\npolicies or action. Drummond Wolff had advised being \"patient, pleasant,\r\npersistent,\" to which I would add: eternally vigilant.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the interests of the United States throughout the Ottoman\r\nEmpire were peculiar, in that the majority of the complaints related to\r\npersonal, as distinct from commercial, rights. I have said in an earlier\r\nchapter that some of the questions at issue, especially those involving\r\nextraterritoriality, grew out of capitulations dating back over four\r\nhundred years, to the conquest of Constantinople by the Moslems in 1453.\r\nThe terms of these capitulations or \"privileges\" were made originally\r\nbetween the Greeks and the various Italian city republics--Pisa, Genoa,\r\nVenice. The Moslems later embodied them in revised capitulations with\r\nFrance in 1535, 1604, 1673, and 1740; with England in 1583 and 1675;\r\nwith Holland in 1680; with Austria in 1718; and with Russia in 1783. On\r\nthese later European capitulations was based our own first treaty with\r\nthe Sublime Porte in 1830. Practically speaking, therefore, consular\r\njurisdiction in Turkey was then not very different from what it was in\r\nthe fifteenth century.\r\n\r\nWhen I took office one of the vexatious questions to be settled was the\r\ninterpretation of Clause IV of the Treaty of 1830. This treaty was\r\nnegotiated by Charles Rhind, as American commissioner, with Reis\r\nEffendi, Turkish representative. Rhind had prepared it, with the help of\r\ndragoman Navoni, in French and in Turkish, and when it was finally drawn\r\nup, according to Rhind's own report, Reis Effendi \"signed and sealed the\r\ntreaty in Turkish and I did the same with the French translation, and we\r\nexchanged them.\" Thereupon the original Turkish version, together with a\r\ncopy of the French translation as signed by the American\r\ncommissioners--President Jackson had appointed Captain James Biddle and\r\nDavid Offley together with Rhind--and several English translations were\r\ntransmitted to Washington. The treaty actually approved by the Senate\r\nwas one of the English versions.\r\n\r\nBefore the ratifications were exchanged the American charge d'affaires\r\nat Constantinople, David Porter, received word that the French version\r\nwas not exactly in agreement with the Turkish. Porter's simple method of\r\ncorrecting this discrepancy was to sign a document, also in the Turkish\r\nlanguage, accepting the Turkish version of the treaty without reserve;\r\nand when the translation of this document reached Washington nothing\r\nfurther was said.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the treaty rested in peace until 1868, when the American\r\nminister, acting according to the English version, clashed with the\r\nTurkish authorities in the interpretation of Clause IV, regarding\r\njurisdiction over American citizens--in this case two who had been\r\narrested and imprisoned for alleged offenses against the Turkish\r\nGovernment. The English version read:\r\n\r\n     Citizens of the United States of America, quietly pursuing their\r\n     commerce, and not being charged or convicted of any crime or\r\n     offence, shall not be molested; and even when they may have\r\n     committed some offence they shall not be arrested and put in\r\n     prison, by the local authorities, but they shall be tried by their\r\n     Minister or Consul, and punished according to their offence,\r\n     following, in this respect, the usage observed towards other\r\n     Franks.\r\n\r\nWhen our Government proceeded to obtain exact translations of this\r\nclause, it was found that the Turkish version did not contain the words\r\n\"arrested\" or \"tried,\" although the phraseology made clear that American\r\ncitizens were not to be imprisoned in Turkish prisons, but punished\r\nthrough their minister or consul. Consequently, the Turkish authorities\r\ncould arrest but not imprison, could try but not inflict punishment.\r\n\r\nThe Turkish Government would not recognize as accurate any of the\r\ntranslations the United States presented. When asked to present a\r\ntranslation of its own, however, the matter was gradually put in\r\nabeyance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1862 our minister, E. J. Morris, concluded another treaty with the\r\nPorte, entitled, as was the first one, \"A Treaty of Commerce and\r\nNavigation,\" which, by its Article XX, was to remain in force\r\ntwenty-eight years unless either party saw fit to abrogate at the end of\r\nfourteen or twenty-one years. In January, 1874, the Turkish Government\r\ngave notice to our Department of State of its desire to terminate the\r\ntreaty, following this notice up with another communication to the same\r\neffect in September, 1875. Although by the terms of the treaty such\r\nnotice was to be permissible not earlier than June, 1876, nothing was\r\nsaid in Washington regarding the untimeliness of these communications,\r\nand in his Annual Message of December, 1876, President Grant announced:\r\n\"Under this notice the treaty terminated upon the fifth day of June\r\n1876.\" President Cleveland, on the other hand, in his first Annual\r\nMessage nine years later, questioned the official termination, but\r\nadded: \"As the commercial rights of our citizens in Turkey come under\r\nthe favored-nation guarantee of the prior treaty of 1830 ... no\r\ninconvenience can result\" from our agreeing to the abrogation. Thus\r\nquestions of jurisdiction and commercial rights were thrown back for\r\nsettlement under the Treaty of 1830, the translation of which was and\r\nhas remained in dispute.\r\n\r\nMuch of this confusion was due, again, to the slight actual regard, on\r\nthe part of the Ottoman Empire, for the terms of treaties. In this\r\nattitude they had been encouraged by some of the European nations--most\r\nof all Russia in its more powerful days--who, in return for other\r\nadvantages, were not insistent upon their claims under the\r\ncapitulations, especially the claims of jurisdiction over nationals. So\r\nfar as concerned the United States, this loose effectiveness of treaties\r\ncaused constant misunderstanding with regard to the handling of cases\r\narising under them.\r\n\r\nWith every question that came up under the disputed Clause IV, for\r\ninstance, the Turks would controvert the right of our consuls to try,\r\nand we would insist on that right. The battle then would be won after a\r\nfashion by the side with the most persistence. During my administration\r\nI happened to be the winner much of the time, although my winning merely\r\nreleased a possibly innocent person; for while we argued about a trial\r\nfor the suspect he lingered in jail, and after I got his release the\r\nTurks would refuse to acknowledge our jurisdiction and not prosecute.\r\nInnocent and guilty alike were made to suffer in jail, and alike were\r\nset scot-free upon release. Not only that, but whenever an American\r\ncitizen committed, or was alleged to have committed, a crime and was\r\narrested by the Turkish authorities, it created irritation and a strain\r\nof our relationship.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe only other treaty then negotiated between the Ottoman Government and\r\nour own--the Treaty of Naturalization and Extradition--had also been a\r\nsubject for discussion and dispute ever since it was signed by Minister\r\nGeorge H. Boker in 1874. When it was concluded, the Senate refused to\r\nconfirm it because under it American citizenship was forfeited _ipso\r\nfacto_ by the return of the naturalized citizen to his native land and\r\nhis remaining there two years; but the Senate amended this treaty by\r\nchanging the phraseology of the clause containing the two-year\r\nreference. The Sublime Porte accepted the amendment by a declaration of\r\nwhat it understood to be its intent and significance, which\r\ninterpretation our Government, in turn, would not accept.\r\n\r\nAnd there that treaty was hung in 1875, although our Government that\r\nyear made an appropriation of ten thousand eight hundred dollars for\r\npresents to Turkish officials, which was then customary on concluding a\r\ntreaty with the Porte.\r\n\r\nAs the conditions which had called forth the treaty continued to exist,\r\nI was instructed to renew negotiations in the matter. A number of\r\nChristian subjects of the Porte--some Greeks and some Syrians, but\r\nprincipally Armenians--in order to free themselves from Turkish\r\njurisdiction had fled to the United States. Here they remained long\r\nenough to become citizens, and from time to time they came back to\r\nTurkey, where they were charged with being involved in alleged\r\nconspiracies against the Turkish Government. Such cases arose\r\nfrequently, and it was felt that the Treaty of Naturalization and\r\nExtradition with the two-year clause, similar to the one we have with\r\nmany other nations, would prevent citizens of the Porte from using\r\nnaturalization in America as a means of escaping liability as subjects\r\nof Turkey upon their return there.\r\n\r\nI addressed myself to bringing about an adjustment of these\r\ndifficulties, either by securing a new treaty or having the one of 1874\r\naccepted as amended. A long and tedious exchange of notes on the subject\r\nensued. Finally the Porte agreed to accept the Treaty of 1874 as\r\namended.\r\n\r\nOf course I was elated, and the State Department was pleased. That the\r\ntreaty was one very much desired by our Government was clear. I received\r\na long, flattering cable of congratulation from Mr. Bayard, and a letter\r\nin similar vein from Mr. Adee, saying in part:\r\n\r\n     Whatever may be the outcome of these negotiations, you are to be\r\n     congratulated without stint on having achieved a decided diplomatic\r\n     success by causing the Government of the Porte to recede from the\r\n     position which it took in 1875, with respect to the Senate\r\n     amendments, and to which it has so pertinaciously adhered ever\r\n     since, until you wrought a change of heart and induced it to take a\r\n     more rational view of the subject. This makes it far easier for us\r\n     to deal with the question now as justice and equity and due respect\r\n     for the rights and privileges attaching to American nationality may\r\n     demand.\r\n\r\nThen the bubble burst! Under my instructions I had assured the Turkish\r\nauthorities that with their acceptance of the amendments of our Senate\r\nthe negotiations in the matter would be concluded, and all that would be\r\nnecessary to give effect to the treaty was the proclamation of the\r\nPresident. Instead, however, it was thought best again to submit the\r\nterms to the Senate, as fourteen years had elapsed since the negotiation\r\nof the original treaty. Thereupon some of our leading missionaries, at\r\nthe instigation of prominent Armenians who had been naturalized in\r\nAmerica and returned to Turkey, opposed ratification, and no further\r\naction was taken. It was a very discouraging situation, for many\r\nannoying cases constantly came up, some of a rather serious nature.\r\n\r\nI might add that ten years later, when I was again minister to Turkey, I\r\nwas instructed to renew negotiations, but the Ottoman Government was now\r\nunwilling to negotiate at all on this subject, and we were left without\r\nany treaty of naturalization.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere were one or two interesting special matters that came up during\r\nthis mission. Toward the end of 1887 Baron Maurice de Hirsch came to\r\nConstantinople to adjust some financial differences with the Turkish\r\nGovernment. His railway, connecting Constantinople with European cities,\r\nwas about completed. The Turkish Government claimed that he owed it\r\n132,000,000 francs, a claim growing out of kilometric guarantees and\r\nother concessions.\r\n\r\nOne day while I was calling on the Grand Vizier, Kiamil Pasha, he asked\r\nto introduce some one to me, and forthwith I met a tall and slender man\r\nin his fifties, dark eyes sparkling with spirit and energy, clean-shaven\r\nexcept for a full black mustache, dressed rather dudishly in a cutaway\r\ncoat, white vest and white spats--Baron de Hirsch. I was glad of this\r\nopportunity, for I had often heard of him and his great philanthropic\r\nactivities. We had a pleasant conversation about things in general.\r\n\r\nA few days later I took dinner with the Sultan. He spoke to me about\r\nBaron de Hirsch and the claim of Turkey against him. The Turkish\r\nGovernment was hard-pressed for funds--its chronic condition. The Sultan\r\nexplained that for some time efforts had been made to arrive at some\r\nsettlement, and that it was now proposed to arbitrate. The Baron had\r\nsuggested first the French and then the Austrian ambassador as\r\narbitrator, but neither was satisfactory to His Majesty; he, however,\r\nhad much confidence in my judgment and impartiality, so that he had\r\ncounter-suggested my name to the Baron, which was satisfactory to the\r\nlatter; and they had agreed to pay me an honorarium of one million\r\nfrancs.\r\n\r\nI assured the Sultan that I was much complimented by his request, but I\r\nwould have to consult the Secretary of State. He told me he had already\r\nrequested the Turkish minister at Washington to inquire the views of the\r\nDepartment, and that Mr. Bayard had said there was no objection to my\r\nacting as arbitrator. But I said I would have to communicate with Mr.\r\nBayard personally and would let His Majesty hear from me in the course\r\nof a few days.\r\n\r\nI cabled Mr. Bayard and learned, as the Sultan had said, that there was\r\nno objection to my acceding to the latter's wishes and accepting the\r\nhonorarium if it appeared to me advisable. Upon giving the proposal\r\ncareful consideration, however, I felt it would not be wise for me to\r\ncomply with the Sultan's request, much as I should have liked to please\r\nhim. Any transaction with the Turkish Government involving money was\r\nopen to suspicion of improper methods and bribery. Had I as arbitrator\r\nmade a decision disappointing to the Turkish Government, I should\r\ncertainly have fallen under such suspicion, and I deemed it improper to\r\nassume an obligation which might throw the American legation into a\r\nfalse light.\r\n\r\nI advised Secretary Bayard accordingly and frankly told the Sultan I\r\ncould not accept. I added, however, that while I would not accept an\r\nhonorarium, I should be glad to act as mediator to see whether a\r\nsatisfactory adjustment could not be brought about between the Baron and\r\nthe Grand Vizier, which offer the Sultan accepted.\r\n\r\nAs the negotiations went forward, the Baron and the Grand Vizier had\r\nfrequent disagreements and altercations. Each of them would come to me\r\nwith his grievance, and I would give my opinion and bring them together\r\nagain. Finally there arose a legal question, and this was submitted to\r\nProfessor Gneist, the famous German authority on international law. Upon\r\nhis decision the Baron finally paid the Turkish Government 22,000,000\r\nfrancs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring these negotiations, which lasted several months, an intimate\r\nfriendship developed between the Baron and his wife and Mrs. Straus and\r\nmyself. They often took family dinner with us. They were declining\r\nofficial invitations because of the recent death of their only child,\r\nLucien. The Baroness was an exceptionally fine woman, learned and able,\r\nwhose principal aim in life seemed to be to find ways of being most\r\nhelpful to others. In the quarters of the poor, both Jew and Gentile,\r\nher short, trim figure, dressed in deep mourning, was familiar. Her face\r\nhad an attractively benign expression. A story regarding her activities\r\nin connection with the construction of her husband's railroad was\r\ncharacteristic of her.\r\n\r\nIn a village near Constantinople a number of houses belonging to the\r\npoor had to be torn down to make way for the railway station. The work\r\nwas to be done with the understanding that the Turkish Government would\r\ncompensate these people, but evidently no such consideration was\r\nforthcoming. A number of those thus dispossessed came to the Baron to\r\ncomplain, but he answered that it was the Government's responsibility,\r\nnot his. On hearing of this the Baroness informed her husband that she\r\ndid not propose to let the railroad cause unhappiness to people, that it\r\nwould probably be a long time before the Government paid the\r\ncompensation, if ever, and that she insisted on paying these people out\r\nof her own private fortune so they could at once build new houses and be\r\nhappy. Then and there she carried out that programme.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Baron spoke to me of his own benefactions and said he purposed\r\nduring his lifetime to devote his fortune to benevolent causes. His\r\nphilanthropy up to that time had been bestowed mainly in Russia, but he\r\nwas desirous of doing something for the Russians who, because of the\r\noppression resultant from the Ignatieff laws, were emigrating to\r\nAmerica. They had been persecuted and were poor, and he wanted to enable\r\nthem to reestablish themselves.\r\n\r\nI was familiar with the conditions of these Russian immigrants, because\r\nprior to my coming to Turkey I had been in close relationship for\r\nseveral years with Michael Heilprin, author of a number of scholarly\r\nworks and one of the chief editors of Appleton's Encyclopaedia. He worked\r\nuntiringly on behalf of these new arrivals, collecting money for them\r\nand aiding them personally in numerous ways. I think his untimely death\r\nwas due primarily to his generous expenditure of energy in this way. I\r\nmentioned Heilprin to the Baron and said I would write him for\r\nsuggestions how best the immigrants might be helped.\r\n\r\nWhen I heard from Heilprin I forwarded the letter to the Baron, together\r\nwith a list of men who had done most in the way of benevolent work for\r\nthe Jews of New York. Prominent on that list were Meyer S. Isaacs,\r\npresident of the United Hebrew Congregations; Jesse Seligman, president\r\nof the Hebrew Orphan Asylum; Jacob H. Schiff, who was connected with a\r\nnumber of our charitable enterprises; and my brother Isidor. The Baron\r\nsubsequently communicated with Mr. Isaacs and some others, and out of\r\ntheir arrangements grew the Baron de Hirsch Fund and the Baron de Hirsch\r\nTrade School. Later the Baroness, upon conferring with Mrs. Straus,\r\nendowed the Clara de Hirsch Home for Working Girls.\r\n\r\nNeither my wife nor I wish to claim any credit for the founding of the\r\nde Hirsch benevolent institutions. We were simply the medium through\r\nwhich these came into being. We never even suggested the nature of them.\r\nWe only gave the requested information regarding the need for such\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OSCAR S. STRAUS\r\n\r\nConstantinople, 1888]\r\n\r\nBut to come back to Constantinople and its railroads. During 1888 the\r\nquestion of a railroad from Constantinople to the Persian Gulf was much\r\nagitated, especially by the Germans. The Grand Vizier several times\r\nbrought up the subject in conversation with me, asking me to help him\r\nget in communication with some reliable American railroad builders. He\r\nassured me that the Turkish Government would give more favorable terms\r\nto a group of Americans because the project would then be free from the\r\npolitical complications that might ensue if a road through the heart\r\nof the empire were controlled by Germany or any other European power.\r\n\r\nWilliam K. Vanderbilt was in Constantinople at the time. He had arrived\r\nin his yacht, which was larger than most yachts that came through the\r\nDardanelles, so it was stopped until I could procure for him a special\r\npermit from the Sultan to proceed. At the Sultan's request, I spoke to\r\nVanderbilt about the railroad and introduced him to the Grand Vizier.\r\nBut he was on pleasure bent and not inclined to take up the cares and\r\nburdens involved in such an undertaking.\r\n\r\nOf course it was apparent that if American capitalists and railroad\r\nbuilders with their vast experience would take up the construction of\r\nthis road it would put tremendous power and prestige into American\r\nhands. I suggested that Carl Schurz and Henry Villard might be the\r\nproper persons to undertake this gigantic work. Villard's name had\r\nfigured prominently in the completion of the Northern Pacific; he was\r\nclose to Schurz, and they each enjoyed a high reputation. Soon\r\nthereafter the Porte submitted the matter to a syndicate of German,\r\nBritish, and French bankers, and the famous Bagdad Railroad was not\r\nbuilt by Americans.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1888 I received a letter from an old friend, the Reverend\r\nWilliam Hayes Ward, eminent Assyriologist and scholarly editor of the\r\n\"Independent,\" respecting an expedition for excavating in Babylonia\r\nwhich the Reverend John P. Peters, of the University of Pennsylvania,\r\ncontemplated. Under Dr. William Pepper, provost of the university, Dr.\r\nPeters was organizing the Babylon Exploration Fund, which would base its\r\nwork on the recommendations made in 1884-85 by the Wolfe expedition\r\nheaded by Dr. Ward himself. The Wolfe expedition, financed by Miss\r\nCatherine L. Wolfe, of New York City, had been limited to\r\nreconnoissance and exploration. Shortly thereafter the subject was\r\nbrought to my attention officially by Mr. Adee, of the Department of\r\nState, who wrote me:\r\n\r\n     We find ourselves between two fires,--on one hand is the\r\n     Philadelphia organization under the lead of Dr. Peters, which has\r\n     the money, and on the other is the Johns Hopkins enterprise, which\r\n     has the most solid ballasting of Assyriological talent, but,\r\n     unfortunately, its dollars are limited. As the Johns Hopkins people\r\n     deposit all their collections in the National Museum, Professor\r\n     Langley feels kindly disposed towards them.... We shall probably\r\n     have to look to you as the _deus ex machina_ to prescribe a\r\n     solution.\r\n\r\nI conferred unofficially with Hamdy Bey, director of the Imperial Museum\r\nat Stamboul, himself a very competent scientist and in charge of all\r\nexcavations in Turkey, who informed me fully regarding the Turkish law\r\ngoverning excavations, among other things that a permit for making them\r\nhad to be obtained from the Ministry of Public Instruction (and these\r\npermits were not easily obtained); and that all objects discovered were\r\nthe property of the Turkish Government, the excavator being permitted\r\nonly moulds or drawings thereof, except possibly in the case of certain\r\nduplicates.\r\n\r\nTo save time in the matter, I brought it before the Grand Vizier, who\r\npromised support in laying the project before His Majesty the Sultan,\r\nwith the view possibly of getting an irade to export at least a portion,\r\nif not half, of the objects discovered. I suggested to our State\r\nDepartment that the University of Pennsylvania and Johns Hopkins work\r\ntogether and operate as one body, so that an irade, should it be\r\nobtainable, might serve for the benefit of all concerned.\r\n\r\nWhile _en route_ to the United States on a short leave of absence I met\r\nDr. Peters in London. He handed me a letter of introduction from\r\nPresident Cleveland asking my good offices. The proposed excavations\r\ninterested me very much, and I promised Dr. Peters I would give the\r\nsubject immediate attention upon returning to my post. Meanwhile I\r\ninstructed the charge, Mr. King, how to proceed in my absence.\r\n\r\nEarly in November when I got back to Constantinople I asked for an\r\naudience with the Sultan to explain the purposes of the exploration\r\nfund, the interest of the various universities and scientific societies\r\nin it, adding that I had received a personal letter from the President\r\nin regard to it, and that if he would give the permit to excavate it\r\nwould meet with high appreciation in my country.\r\n\r\nIt was the custom for ministers, as distinct from ambassadors, to\r\ndismount at the Palace gate and proceed to the Palace on foot. For this\r\noccasion, however, orders had been given for our coming in at the Palace\r\ndoor. Here I was met by His Highness, the Grand Vizier; the Minister of\r\nForeign Affairs; and the Grand Master of Ceremonies. After some fifteen\r\nminutes the Grand Vizier and the Grand Master of Ceremonies ushered me\r\ninto the presence of His Majesty. A private audience took place, wherein\r\nthe Sultan seemed very affable indeed. He said he was happy to welcome\r\nme back to my post and hoped that Mrs. Straus and I had had a pleasant\r\ntrip.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty then led the way to the brilliantly illuminated dining-hall,\r\nwhere a military orchestra of about thirty members was playing. I was\r\nseated at His Majesty's right, with the dragoman next to me, and the\r\nGrand Vizier was at the left; down both sides sat the pashas, their\r\nbreasts sparkling with diamond orders. The dinner was served on gold and\r\nsilver plates, and the menu was excellent and not overburdened. The\r\nSultan conversed freely, cheerfully, and apparently without reserve.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner we went with him to a play in the little theater on the\r\nPalace grounds. At an opportune moment between the acts, while His\r\nMajesty questioned me regarding some matters in the United States, I\r\nreferred to the excavations, and to the fact that several\r\nrepresentatives of the universities were awaiting his decision. He\r\ngraciously stated that permission would be granted, and it was given a\r\nvery few days thereafter.\r\n\r\nThough we were all somewhat disappointed because the permit was more\r\nrestricted than we had been led to expect, it enabled Dr. Peters and his\r\nparty to go ahead with their work. Dr. Peters has left a full account of\r\nthe explorations and the objects discovered, some of them dating back\r\nearlier than 4000 B.C., in his two volumes entitled \"Nippur,\" which form\r\na lasting memorial to his services in the cause of archaeology.\r\n\r\nUnfavorable as we thought the permit was, I was accused by Theodore\r\nBent, British archaeologist, writing in the \"Contemporary Review,\" of\r\nbribing Hamdy Bey to obtain a favorable firman. He himself had dug at\r\nThasos the previous year and had run into difficulties with the Turkish\r\nauthorities, resulting in the seizure of his findings. He still felt\r\nrevengeful toward Hamdy Bey, and the knowledge of our negotiations for a\r\npermit afforded him ground for a scurrilous attack on the director of\r\nthe museum, who was, nevertheless, a man of fine character and high\r\nrepute.\r\n\r\nThe fact really was that the Sultan felt somewhat under obligations to\r\nme because of my services in another matter. There were in the Ottoman\r\nEmpire a million or more Persians, mainly rug dealers. Many of them had\r\nmarried Turkish women. The Sultan claimed that when a Persian in Turkey\r\nmarried a Turkish subject his nationality followed that of his wife. The\r\ncontroversy had gone so far that the Shah of Persia was about to recall\r\nhis ambassador, and they finally agreed to submit the matter to me for\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\nI took the subject under advisement and wrote an opinion in accordance\r\nwith the universally accepted doctrine of nationality under such\r\nconditions, namely, that upon marriage nationality followed that of the\r\nhusband. But instead of rendering my decision, I advised the Sultan what\r\nit would be and suggested that it would probably make for better\r\nrelationship if he would anticipate my decision by agreeing with the\r\nShah's contention. This he appreciated. At the same time it relieved me\r\nfrom the necessity of deciding against the sovereign to whom I was\r\naccredited.\r\n\r\nOf course the Shah's ambassador, Mohsin Khan, who was practically\r\nviceroy in the Ottoman Empire, desired to confer upon me Persia's\r\ndecoration, the Lion and the Sun, set in costly brilliants, and once\r\nmore I had to explain our custom in regard to such things. It is indeed\r\na wise provision of our Constitution which prohibits American officials\r\nfrom accepting \"any present, emolument, office or title of any kind\r\nwhatever\" without the consent of Congress.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe election of 1888 having resulted in a Republican victory, I tendered\r\nmy resignation to the new President upon his taking office, as is\r\ncustomary for heads of missions when there has been a change in the\r\nadministration. I was unofficially informed that numerous letters and\r\nmemorials had been received in Washington from individuals and\r\nmissionary and church bodies, asking that I be retained at my post; Dr.\r\nPepper, of the University of Pennsylvania, and several other university\r\nheads also joined in urging my retention. But I wrote Dr. Pepper not to\r\npush the request, as I could no longer absent myself from my private\r\naffairs. The main matters of difference between the two Governments had\r\nbeen settled, and I felt justified in resigning, even had Cleveland been\r\nreelected, for I could not afford to stay on except under pressure of\r\npatriotic necessity.\r\n\r\nThe salary at the Porte barely covered my house rent. I had secured the\r\nbest available house with facilities for entertaining and the returning\r\nof hospitalities, and, as I have mentioned before, such functions are\r\nessential for the proper relations with one's colleagues and the\r\ngovernment to which one is accredited. Besides, it is important to be\r\nable to show to one's nationals the hospitality they expect from their\r\ndiplomatic representatives, especially in the case of prominent visitors\r\nwho bring letters from high officials at home.\r\n\r\nAgain, \"noblesse oblige\" has its widest and most emphatic application in\r\ndiplomacy. Americans are supposed to be rich, and if an American\r\ndiplomat does not show the usual hospitalities he is charged with\r\npenuriousness, for it is understood that a man who is not able to live\r\naccording to his station would not be chosen to head a mission. That his\r\npay may be inadequate for the discharge of his social duties is not\r\ngenerally known. When I was in Washington during my leave of absence Mr.\r\nCleveland asked me how I got along on my salary, and I told him then\r\nthat I could have got along fairly well on four times the amount, for I\r\nhad spent between thirty-five and forty thousand dollars a year.\r\n\r\nA few days prior to leaving my post in June, 1889, I again dined with\r\nthe Sultan. I had often done so during my stay, but this time he was\r\nespecially gracious and unreserved. He expressed great regret at my\r\ngoing, saying that at no time during his reign had the relations of our\r\ncountries been more agreeable, and that he and his minister had had\r\nevery confidence in my candor and fairness. What seemed to have\r\nimpressed him most was my handling of a large claim by an American which\r\nwas being urged through the legation. I carefully examined this claim\r\nand found it to be justified neither in morals nor in law, and I\r\ninformed the Turkish Government accordingly that I had withdrawn it. The\r\nPorte was not accustomed to such fair treatment! Of course, ever\r\nafterward when I presented a matter it was believed to be justified.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Sultan held the government pretty firmly in his own hands--too much\r\nso in fact--and kept himself very well informed regarding all manner of\r\nthings. On this evening he said he had heard of the great disaster and\r\nloss of lives caused by the Johnstown flood and he desired to transmit\r\nthrough me two hundred pounds to be used for relief work. I cabled the\r\namount to the Secretary of State on the following day and communicated\r\nto His Majesty our Government's acknowledgment:\r\n\r\n     Express grateful appreciation of the President and the Government\r\n     of the United States for the Sultan's generous relief for flood\r\n     sufferers.\r\n\r\nWhen it became known that I was about to leave my post I received many\r\ncommunications expressing regret. These were a great satisfaction,\r\nespecially one beautiful letter from the missionaries of Constantinople,\r\nsigned by Edwin E. Bliss, I. F. Pettibone, Joseph K. Greene, H. S.\r\nBarnum, Charles A. S. Dwight, Henry O. Dwight, and William G. Bliss.\r\n\r\nAfter we had boarded the steamer to Varna, homeward bound, a royal\r\ncaique--a rowboat of the graceful lines of a Venetian gondola and manned\r\nby six oarsmen--came alongside our ship and one of the Sultan's aides\r\ncame aboard to present to Mrs. Straus the highest order of the Shefekat\r\ndecoration, a star set in brilliants, with the special request of His\r\nMajesty that she accept it as a token of his esteem and regard. As the\r\nregulations prohibiting me from accepting such honors did not apply to\r\nmy wife, she graciously accepted this parting gift from Abdul Hamid.\r\n\r\nAnd so farewell to Pera and the beautiful Bosphorus!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nHARRISON, CLEVELAND, AND McKINLEY\r\n\r\n     One function of ex-diplomats--Russian refugees in flight to\r\n     America--President Harrison remonstrates with Czar against\r\n     persecutions--\"A decree to leave one country is an order to enter\r\n     another\"--Grover Cleveland's fight for sound money--His letters to\r\n     me--\"The Little White House\"--Cleveland under fire for Van Alen\r\n     appointment--Cleveland's theatrical tastes--A midnight supper of\r\n     delicatessen and beer--Cleveland's first meeting with Charles F.\r\n     Murphy, of Tammany Hall--The final confidences of an\r\n     ex-President--A pilgrimage in England to the school attended by\r\n     Roger Williams--I join the fight for election reforms--President\r\n     McKinley summons me to Washington to discuss plan to avert war with\r\n     Spain--A proposal to \"rattle the Sultan's windows\"--McKinley urges\r\n     me to again accept the Turkish post--\"Secretary of State for\r\n     Turkey.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHad diplomacy been a career, nothing would have pleased me more than to\r\ncontinue in such service of my country. On the whole I cannot say that I\r\nadvocate changing our system as to a more permanent service for the\r\nheads of missions. Our President is now unhampered to select men who are\r\nbest qualified to deal with the problems in hand at the various posts.\r\nThis is an advantage over a system that tends to keep in office\r\nministers and ambassadors who are ill equipped to bring statesmanlike\r\nqualities to their work, though they may be past-masters in routine and\r\nsocial requirements. But it would be well if, on a change of\r\nadministration, removals of heads of missions were the exception rather\r\nthan the rule. Of course, after four or eight years, the return of our\r\ndiplomatic chiefs from foreign fields to the various parts of our\r\ncountry has the advantage of enabling these men, by reason of their\r\nexperience and standing, to inform and in a measure guide public opinion\r\non questions concerning international affairs.\r\n\r\nOn my return to New York I reentered business, but continued to take a\r\ndeep and active interest in public affairs. I spent much of my spare\r\ntime lecturing on public questions and historical matters.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWaves of Russian-Jewish immigrants were pounding our shores in the\r\nspring of 1891. In Russia, pogroms and other forms of mob persecution\r\nhad become so persistent that refugees were arriving in pitiful droves\r\nat our ports. Sinister circumstance had hurled them from one country\r\ninto another. Many had been compelled to abandon their employment or\r\neven their own established businesses in Russia, owing to the\r\nenforcement of the Ignatieff laws and the consequent prohibitions,\r\nrestrictions, and persecutions.\r\n\r\nDetermined to make a strenuous protest, a small committee was formed of\r\nprominent Jews from New York, Cincinnati, and Chicago, to lay before\r\nPresident Harrison the pitiable conditions day by day presented by the\r\narriving refugees, many of whom had been stripped of all their\r\npossessions.\r\n\r\nOur committee was headed by Jesse Seligman, and among the others I\r\nrecall Jacob H. Schiff, of New York, and General Lewis Seasongood, of\r\nCincinnati, besides myself. The President listened to our story with\r\nsympathetic interest, and then turned to me and asked what, in the light\r\nof my international and diplomatic experience, I thought should be done.\r\nI told him that we had a right to remonstrate with any nation with which\r\nwe were on friendly terms, as we were with Russia, for committing an\r\nunfriendly act if that nation by special laws forced groups of its\r\npeople, in pitiable condition, to seek refuge in another country and\r\nthat country our own.\r\n\r\nThe President agreed, but suggested that our Government ought to have\r\nbefore it an official report or statement of facts. I replied that this\r\ncould easily be obtained by sending a competent commission to Russia to\r\nmake inquiry. Promptly Colonel John B. Weber, immigration commissioner\r\nat Ellis Island, admirably qualified because of his experience in office\r\nand his sympathetic interest, together with Dr. Walter Kempster, a\r\nphysician known for his studies of the pathology of insanity, were sent\r\nabroad to make an investigation and report. Their investigation was\r\nthorough, and they embodied their findings in a report that is a model\r\nof its kind. It was the first authentic and official report on these\r\nRussian restrictions and persecutions, and when published it aroused\r\ngreat interest in all enlightened parts of Europe as well as at home.\r\nThe distinguished English historian, Lecky, refers to it in his own\r\nwork, \"Democracy and Liberty.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge Jones, of the \"New York Times,\" also had an investigation and\r\nreport made by his London correspondent, Harold Frederic. These findings\r\nthe \"Times\" published as articles and syndicated them to several other\r\npapers of the country, and later Frederic brought them out in book form\r\nunder the title \"The New Exodus.\"\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison was much impressed with the report of the commission,\r\nand through diplomatic channels brought the matter to the attention of\r\nthe Russian Government. His reference to this action in the Annual\r\nMessage of December, 1891, is such a clear and convincing recognition of\r\nhumanitarian diplomacy, that I quote it:\r\n\r\n     This Government has found occasion to express, in a friendly\r\n     spirit, but with much earnestness, to the Government of the Czar,\r\n     its serious concern because of the harsh measures now being\r\n     enforced against the Hebrews in Russia.... It is estimated that\r\n     over one million will be forced from Russia within a few years....\r\n\r\n     The banishment, whether by direct decree or by not less certain\r\n     indirect methods, of so large a number of men and women is not a\r\n     local question. A decree to leave one country is, in the nature of\r\n     things, an order to enter another--some other. This consideration,\r\n     as well as the suggestions of humanity, furnishes ample ground for\r\n     the remonstrances which we have presented to Russia, while our\r\n     historic friendship for that Government can not fail to give the\r\n     assurance that our representations are those of a sincere\r\n     wellwisher.\r\n\r\nThe President's Message was largely quoted and favorably commented upon\r\nin this and many European countries. All of this had a reaction in\r\nRussia itself. No matter how autocratic a government may be, as Russia\r\nthen was, it cannot free itself from \"a decent respect to the opinions\r\nof mankind.\" For the time being conditions in Russia for the Jews were\r\nameliorated.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1891 I was a delegate to the Democratic State Convention\r\nat Saratoga and was a member of the platform committee. One of the\r\nquestions to be solved was: What should be our position regarding\r\nsilver? Cleveland's statement of his position during his first term had\r\nlost him the Presidency.\r\n\r\nQuite purposely Cleveland had boldly accentuated, while in office, the\r\noutstanding issues then before the country--the tariff and sound\r\nmoney--without any regard to political consequences. His friend, Richard\r\nWatson Gilder, has said of him in this connection:[1]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 1: _Grover Cleveland_, _A Record of Friendship_, p. 33.]\r\n\r\n     Every once in a while Cleveland \"threw away the Presidency,\" and I\r\n     never saw him so happy as when he had done it; as, for instance,\r\n     after the tariff message, and now again after the silver letter.\r\n\r\nCleveland, while not a scholar, was ultra-conscientious and had an\r\nhonest and logical mind that dealt with fundamentals. He would \"mull\r\nover\" (that is the very phrase I have heard him use) a question until\r\nhe got to the bottom, and there he would start to build up his premises\r\nand arrive at his decisions. Because of the surplus accumulating in the\r\nTreasury he had been impressed more and more with the fact that the\r\ntaxes and the tariff should be reduced. He realized, during the spring\r\nand summer of 1887, that the rapid increase of this surplus was becoming\r\na menace to the stability of our financial system, and he felt it his\r\nduty to provide some means for averting commercial disaster. At the\r\nopening of Congress that year, instead of a message covering all of the\r\nGovernment activities as was the invariable custom, he prepared one\r\ndevoted exclusively to the revenue system and to the necessity of\r\nreducing the tariff. He gave much care and deliberation to this message,\r\nbut none to the political consequences.\r\n\r\nAgain later, when the free coinage of silver became a topic of\r\nprominence, the Reform Club of New York invited him to attend a banquet\r\nat which this question was to be discussed. Many of his friends advised\r\nthat he remain silent on the subject, in order not to mar his chances\r\nfor reelection. Cleveland, however, accepted the invitation and boldly\r\nannounced his position regarding \"the dangerous and reckless experiment\r\nof free, unlimited and independent silver coinage.\" That was too much\r\nfor the machine men of the party; the note of Cleveland's doom was\r\nsounded from one end of the country to the other.\r\n\r\nAfter his retirement partisan bitterness largely disappeared, and it\r\nsoon became a foregone conclusion that he would again have to stand for\r\nthe Presidency. Although he had occupied the President's chair only one\r\nterm, I doubt whether any ex-President of our time, with the exception\r\nof Roosevelt, carried with him into private life a deeper interest or a\r\nhigher esteem on the part of the great body of the people. His rugged\r\nhonesty of purpose and determined stand for the best principles in our\r\npublic life were more and more appreciated and valued. During the entire\r\nperiod between his defeat and his reelection he was the most\r\ndistinguished representative of his party.\r\n\r\nWhen the silver question came up in the State Convention at Saratoga, a\r\nfew others and myself contended for a sound money plank. We met with\r\nopposition from a majority of the platform committee. Richard Croker,\r\nboss of Tammany Hall, had not up to that time bothered much about the\r\nsubject. I laid before him the reasons underlying the question and got\r\nhim to throw his powerful influence and help on our side, and we\r\nsucceeded in the end in incorporating a strong sound money plank.\r\n\r\nCleveland expressed his satisfaction with that accomplishment in the\r\nfollowing note to me:\r\n\r\n                                                  _Sept._ 27, 1891\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR MR. STRAUS:\r\n\r\n     I have a suspicion that you had much to do with the formation of\r\n     the silver plank in the platform adopted at Saratoga. I am so well\r\n     satisfied indeed that you thus merit my thanks as a citizen who\r\n     loves the honor of his country and as a Democrat who loves the\r\n     integrity of his party, that I desire to tender them in this frank\r\n     informal manner.\r\n\r\n                                       Yours very truly\r\n                                            GROVER CLEVELAND\r\n\r\n\r\nI may add here that upon his retirement in 1889 Cleveland came to New\r\nYork to live, and the pleasant relations I had had with him in office\r\nbecame close and intimate.\r\n\r\nEarly in July, 1892, I wrote Cleveland regarding his position on the\r\ntariff, and after the Chicago convention which nominated him for the\r\nPresidency, I received the following communication from him:\r\n\r\n                                                 GRAY GABLES\r\n                                            BUZZARDS BAY, MASS.\r\n                                              _July_ 25, 1892\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR SIR:\r\n\r\n     I wish to thank you for your letter of July 12, and to express my\r\n     disappointment that while in New York last week I did not have the\r\n     opportunity to converse with you on the suggestions which your\r\n     letter contained. You cannot fail to see by some expressions in my\r\n     address in reply to the notification committee, that thoughts quite\r\n     similar to yours have occupied my mind in regard to the tariff\r\n     plank in our platform. I am exceedingly anxious that there should\r\n     be no misrepresentation of our true position, and I regret\r\n     exceedingly that there should have been any form of expression\r\n     adopted which makes us liable to that danger.\r\n\r\n     I shall continue to give the subject earnest thought and when I\r\n     write my letter of acceptance if it should then seem to be\r\n     necessary I shall not hesitate to pursue the subject further. I\r\n     have heard of your labors at Chicago and of your constant and\r\n     earnest devotion to my cause, and while your previous conduct and\r\n     our relations have been such as to lead me to expect such things of\r\n     you, I am none the less gratified and beg to thank you from the\r\n     bottom of my heart.\r\n\r\n     With the kind remembrances of Mrs. Cleveland to you and Mrs.\r\n     Straus, in which I heartily join, I am\r\n\r\n                                       Very truly yours\r\n                                               GROVER CLEVELAND\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1888 his position on these two questions caused his defeat; in 1892,\r\nhis position still the same, these very issues were the dominant factors\r\nthat brought about his renomination and election.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring the winter before his second term of office, in order to get some\r\nrest and be freer than was possible in New York from the constant stream\r\nof visitors and place-hunters, he and his family accepted the invitation\r\nof my brother Nathan to occupy a little frame house which my brother\r\nhad bought from a New Jersey farmer in connection with the property on\r\nwhich stands the Lakewood Hotel. The little two-story house, surrounded\r\nby pines, simple as could be, was renovated and painted white, and\r\nbecame known as \"the little White House.\" To it from time to time\r\nCleveland summoned the people with whom he wished to confer--the leaders\r\nof his party with regard to policies and the make-up of his Cabinet, and\r\npersonal friends. He had no secretary and wrote all letters with his own\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nDuring his stay at \"the little White House\" he sent for me several times\r\nto talk over things with him. On one of these occasions he proposed\r\nconnecting me with the Administration in some way that might be\r\nagreeable to me. While I appreciated highly his intention, I told him I\r\nfelt I owed it to my brothers to stick to business for the next few\r\nyears. He answered that he would have to have one of the brothers in his\r\nAdministration. I learned later that in his mind he had reserved the\r\nministership to Holland for Isidor. At about this time Isidor had been\r\nnominated, and was subsequently elected, to fill a vacancy in Congress,\r\nand Cleveland purposely did not fill the Dutch post until after that\r\nspecial election. He afterwards remarked to a friend he and Isidor had\r\nin common, William L. Wilson, of West Virginia, chairman of the Ways and\r\nMeans Committee and responsible for the Wilson Tariff Bill, that he much\r\npreferred Isidor in Congress where he could have the benefit of his\r\nwisdom and knowledge in financial and tariff matters. Indeed, my brother\r\nwas largely responsible for Cleveland's calling the extra session of\r\nCongress for the repeal of the Sherman Silver Coinage Act.\r\n\r\nAmong my letters from Cleveland at this period I have one concerning a\r\nsubject that caused a great deal of stir and unfavorable comment: the\r\nappointment of James J. Van Alen, of Newport, Rhode Island, as\r\nambassador to Italy. Van Alen was a very rich man. He was the son-in-law\r\nof William Astor and the personal friend of William C. Whitney, the real\r\nmanager of the Cleveland campaign, whose appointment as Secretary of the\r\nNavy was not liked by the \"mugwump\" wing of the party, headed by Carl\r\nSchurz and others. When Van Alen was appointed a hue and cry arose from\r\nthe idealists, and Cleveland's enemies alleged that the appointment was\r\nnothing more than a reward for the very large contribution Van Alen had\r\nmade to Whitney for the campaign, for which Whitney had promised this\r\nposition. Schurz, as editor of \"Harper's Weekly,\" wrote a savage\r\neditorial against Cleveland on this subject, and in a letter to me he\r\nstated that he felt Cleveland's prestige would never recover from the\r\nblow he had struck against himself in making that appointment. I wrote\r\nto Cleveland about the matter and how it was regarded by some of his\r\nfriends, mentioning Schurz among others. The President sent me the\r\nfollowing reply:\r\n\r\n                                      EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON\r\n                                              _Oct._ 29, 1893\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR MR. STRAUS:\r\n\r\n     Your letter was received to-day.\r\n\r\n     I need not tell you how much I value your friendship; and I hardly\r\n     need confess how touched I am by the manifestation of affection\r\n     afforded by the solicitude you evince in the Van Alen matter. I am\r\n     amazed by the course pursued by some good people in dealing with\r\n     this subject. No one has yet presented to me a single charge of\r\n     unfitness or incompetency. They have chosen to eagerly act upon the\r\n     frivolous statements of a much mendacious and mischievous\r\n     newspaper, as an attempt to injure a man who in no way has been\r\n     guilty of wrong. I leave out of the account the allegation that his\r\n     nomination was in acknowledgment of a large campaign contribution.\r\n     No one will accuse me of such a trade and Mr. Whitney's and Mr.\r\n     Van Alen's denial that any such thing existed in the minds of any\r\n     one concerned, I believe to be the truth. I think it would be a\r\n     cowardly thing in me to disgrace a man because the New York World\r\n     had doomed him to disgrace. Since the nomination was sent in I have\r\n     left the matter entirely to the Senate, and I hear that the\r\n     nomination was confirmed to-day. This ends the matter. I am\r\n     entirely content to wait for a complete justification of my part in\r\n     the proceeding.\r\n\r\n     I am sorry you regard this matter as so unfortunate, and if\r\n     anything could have induced me to turn away from a course which\r\n     seems to me so plainly just and right, it would be my desire to\r\n     satisfy just such good friends as you have always proved yourself\r\n     to be.\r\n\r\n     I shall be glad to see you at all times.\r\n\r\n                            Yours very sincerely\r\n                                      GROVER CLEVELAND\r\n\r\n\r\nVan Alen was confirmed by the Senate, but on November 20th he sent in\r\nhis resignation, which Cleveland reluctantly accepted, but urged Van\r\nAlen to reconsider his decision, as his (the President's) preference was\r\nemphatically that Van Alen accept the post and by the discharge of his\r\nduties vindicate the wisdom and propriety of his selection.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring the second term I saw little of the President. I was very much\r\ntied to business and went to Washington only when summoned there to\r\ndiscuss a few international questions as they arose. But while I am\r\nreminiscing about my relations with Mr. Cleveland, I shall jump ahead\r\nabout ten years and speak of a visit he paid me for three days during\r\nMarch, 1903. He was to deliver an address at the Henry Ward Beecher\r\nMemorial in the Brooklyn Academy of Music on Sunday evening, and he\r\narrived from Princeton on Saturday. He was like a boy out of school.\r\n\r\nWe were going to the theater on Saturday evening and I suggested Justin\r\nMcCarthy's \"If I Were King,\" played by Sothern.\r\n\r\n\"I hope it is not sad,\" Cleveland said. \"I want to see it from start to\r\nfinish\"; and with a smirk he added, \"for I am a hayseed.\" I discerned\r\nafterward that he would rather have seen a comedy or vaudeville.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived at the theater, many in the audience recognized\r\nCleveland and heads were constantly turning in the direction of our box.\r\nI mentioned it to him, but he said: \"Oh, no, they don't know me any\r\nmore.\" After the theater we had a supper of delicatessen and beer at\r\nhome, which I knew he would like, and he amused us with several funny\r\nstories and mimicry. My wife remarked that he might have made a success\r\non the stage, and he replied that his friend Joe Jefferson had often\r\ndeplored his having missed that profession.\r\n\r\nCleveland gave an imitation of the humorous Congressman Campbell, of New\r\nYork, who used to come to the White House and, pointing to the room\r\noccupied by Cleveland, ask the clerk: \"Is His Royal Nibs in?\" And\r\nsometimes Tim Campbell made requests that Cleveland had to deny as\r\nunconstitutional; then Tim would come back with \"Oh, I wouldn't let the\r\nConstitution stand between friends!\"\r\n\r\nAt dinner on Sunday we were joined by Mr. and Mrs. John G. Carlisle, my\r\nbrother Isidor, his wife, and his business associate, Charles B.\r\nWebster. Carlisle had been one of the most distinguished Senators in\r\nCongress, former Secretary of the Treasury, and a close friend of\r\nCleveland. When the champagne was served my wife said to the\r\nex-President:\r\n\r\n\"Does Mrs. Cleveland let you drink this? You know it is bad for your\r\nrheumatism!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but I won't tell her,\" answered Cleveland.\r\n\r\nThey compromised on one glass.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner the conversation turned to the bond loans during\r\nCleveland's second Administration--the first made through J. P. Morgan &\r\nCompany and the subsequent popular loans--to keep the gold in the United\r\nStates Treasury. The ex-President referred to his fight against the\r\nsilver craze and said he had been compelled to abandon the fundamental\r\nissue, the tariff reform, to combat that dangerous heresy.\r\n\r\nWhen the guests had gone, Cleveland wanted to know whether we would like\r\nto hear the speech he was to deliver that evening, and of course we\r\nassured him we should be delighted. This led to conversation about\r\nBeecher, and I showed him the original letter that Beecher wrote him in\r\n1887 recommending my appointment to Turkey. He said he remembered it\r\nperfectly, and it was the thing that turned the scale while he was\r\nconsidering whether or not he could properly appoint a person of my race\r\nto a post largely concerned with the protection of Christian missions. I\r\nmade bold to request the manuscript of his Memorial Address to file with\r\nmy Beecher letter, and he kindly consented with the words: \"Yes,\r\ncertainly; they are kind of cousins.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a light supper we drove to Brooklyn. Cleveland liked to be\r\npunctual and I took care that we should arrive at the appointed hour,\r\n7.45. It was pouring rain, and Cleveland anticipated that most people\r\nwould be kept away; but when we entered the hall it was packed from pit\r\nto dome and several thousand persons were turned away. At the close of\r\nthe meeting hundreds crowded onto the stage to greet the ex-President,\r\nshowing that the love and admiration of the people had in no degree\r\nwaned.\r\n\r\nThe next morning we prevailed upon him to stay another day. He said he\r\nknew I had a speech to make at Brown University and that its preparation\r\nwould engage my time. But I assured him the speech was all prepared and\r\nthe subject was \"Brown in Diplomacy.\" He asked me to read it to him, and\r\nI did. He pronounced it appropriate and fine, which gave me some\r\nconfidence in the success of the occasion, for I knew he was not given\r\nto flattery and would not have praised the speech without meaning it;\r\nthat was not his habit.\r\n\r\nHe had to go to Rockwood, the photographer, at Thirty-Ninth Street and\r\nBroadway, so I went with him. He said he had hundreds of requests for\r\npictures and wanted a new one taken so that when people wrote for them\r\nhe could refer such requests to Rockwood; similarly he had had some\r\npictures made by a Philadelphia photographer. These arrangements would\r\nsave him much trouble. I asked Rockwood to take a special, large picture\r\nfor me. He brought forward his larger camera and took one of the best\r\nphotographs of Cleveland I have ever seen. I had two finished: one for\r\nMrs. Cleveland and the other for myself, and it now hangs in my library.\r\n\r\nFor luncheon we met Isidor at Delmonico's. At the next table sat Charles\r\nF. Murphy, successor to Croker as boss of Tammany Hall, who requested me\r\nto introduce him to Cleveland. They had quite a chat, after which\r\nCleveland remarked: \"He looks like a pretty clean fellow.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the meal our guest told us, with language, voice, and manner\r\nbefitting the tale, how, when he was being spoken of for reelection\r\nbefore his second term, he met a farmer who said to him: \"Now if you\r\nwill go on sawin' wood and don't say nothin', they will give you back\r\nthat job in Washington.\" No actor could have given a more vivid\r\ncharacterization of that farmer.\r\n\r\nThat evening we went to Weber and Field's Music Hall, on Twenty-Ninth\r\nStreet near Broadway. Cleveland suggested this himself. He said he liked\r\nto be amused at the theater and not saddened or instructed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt about this period Cleveland from time to time showed evidences of\r\nillness. He called them stomach attacks. Whether or not his personal\r\nfriend and physician, Dr. Joseph D. Bryant, had diagnosed the malady as\r\nmore serious I do not know; but at times I rather inferred that he had.\r\nDr. Bryant made it a point to accompany Cleveland on several of his\r\nhunting and fishing expeditions, which were taken not alone for\r\npleasure, but as health measures, for a change of air and the outdoor\r\nrecreation.\r\n\r\nOn and off during those years also, when the family wanted a little\r\nchange, they occupied \"the little White House\" at Lakewood. Cleveland\r\nliked it for its simplicity and because it was not unlike the parsonage\r\nat Caldwell, New Jersey, where he was born. Early in June, 1908, while\r\nthe Clevelands were at Lakewood, the ex-President sent for my brother\r\nIsidor; he desired to have a talk with him. He seemed to wish to\r\nunburden his mind.\r\n\r\nThis proved to be the last time he spoke to any one outside of his\r\nimmediate family while still in the possession of all his faculties.\r\nThat very night he had another attack of his malady, after which, as I\r\nwas told, his faculties seemed to go under a cloud. Two weeks later, on\r\nJune 24th, the country was shocked, though it was not unprepared, to\r\nlearn that the ex-President had died that morning at his Princeton home.\r\n\r\nOn June 26th Grover Cleveland was laid to rest. The funeral was private;\r\nmy brothers and I had received a note from Mrs. Cleveland asking us to\r\nbe present. At his home we met about one hundred of his personal\r\nfriends. It had been his express wish that there be no eulogy or funeral\r\noration, and his friend Dr. Henry van Dyke conducted a simple service at\r\nwhich he read passages from Wordsworth's poem, \"The Happy Warrior.\" In a\r\ncarriage with Chief Justice Fuller, Judge George Gray, of Delaware, and\r\nGovernor Fort, of New Jersey, I accompanied the body to the cemetery.\r\n\r\nFor Grover Cleveland there were no longer enemies to traduce and vilify.\r\nPerhaps no President had ever been so reviled by a hostile press\r\nthroughout the country as this great man, and, strong as he was, these\r\nattacks quite naturally pained him. Public appreciation of men who\r\nstruggle against the tide for righteous things is often deferred,\r\nsometimes until after death. In his case, happily, it came while he was\r\nyet among us in the constantly increasing manifestations of admiration,\r\nlove, and esteem by the people of the country.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have mentioned that during Cleveland's second Administration I seldom\r\nwent to Washington. At that time I was occupied also with the writing of\r\ntwo books. I was not, of course, relying upon my pen for a living. I\r\nshould not have survived long if I had! Historical writing has fittingly\r\nbeen called the aristocracy of literature; it requires long and patient\r\ninvestigation and yields meager returns. For me it made a fascinating\r\navocation. My \"Roger Williams, the Pioneer of Religious Liberty,\" was\r\npublished by the Century Company in 1894, and \"The Development of\r\nReligious Liberty in the United States\" appeared in a limited edition,\r\npublished by Philip Cowen, New York, in 1896.\r\n\r\nThe latter was a slim volume, an amplification of an address I had\r\ndelivered in New Haven before the Yale College Kent Club, and elsewhere;\r\nthe former grew out of studies I had made in preparing my first book,\r\n\"The Origin of Republican Form of Government.\" \"Roger Williams\" was well\r\nreceived and had a generous circulation, being several times reprinted.\r\nBrown University, under the presidency of that eminent historian and\r\nscholar, E. Benjamin Andrews, conferred upon me the honorary degree of\r\nLitt.D.\r\n\r\nWhen I was again in London in 1898 I carried out a purpose I had long\r\nhad, to visit Charterhouse School, earlier known as Sutton's Hospital\r\nSchool, where Roger Williams received his early education. I met the\r\nReverend Doctor William Haig Brown, master, who showed me the register\r\nof the school for 1624 containing the inscription of Roger Williams.\r\nWhen he saw I was much interested in Roger Williams he told me of a\r\nrecent life of him that had been written, which he considered very fine\r\nand with which he wanted to acquaint me. He went to his library on the\r\nfloor above, and when he returned he handed me my own work! (I had not\r\npreviously told him my name.)\r\n\r\nI observed in the main hall of the school a number of tablets\r\ncommemorating distinguished scholars who had attended there. There were\r\nrepresented Thackeray, General Shakespeare, Archdeacon Hale, Sir Henry\r\nHavelock, and several who were sacrificed in the Crimean War and the\r\nIndian Mutiny. I asked Dr. Brown whether he did not think it fitting\r\nthat a tablet should be added in memory of Roger Williams, and said that\r\nI should be glad to defray the expense thereof. He agreed, and I\r\nauthorized him to have the tablet made. He employed Howard Ince, a\r\nwell-known architect, to design the tablet, which contains the following\r\ninscription:\r\n\r\n                    IN MEMORY OF ROGER WILLIAMS\r\n\r\n                Formerly a Scholar of Charterhouse\r\n           Founder of the State of Rhode Island, and the\r\n      Pioneer of Religious Liberty in America. Placed here by\r\n      Oscar S. Straus, United States Minister to Turkey, 1899\r\n\r\nI did not wish my name on it, but Dr. Brown quite definitely preferred\r\nit so.\r\n\r\nOf all my books, the \"Life of Roger Williams\" contains the greatest\r\namount of work in the way of research and study; but the amount of\r\npleasure it gave me in the doing was commensurate.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn politics I had become more impressed year by year with the importance\r\nof a reform in our electoral system, especially in our large cities. The\r\nbosses in the two big parties were the \"invisible powers\" who dictated\r\nthe nominations. Primaries were primaries in name only, and were so\r\nconducted as to strengthen the power of the bosses. In Chicago a\r\ncampaign to purify the primaries had been carried on by the political\r\ncommittee of the Civic Federation. The Federation, of which its\r\norganizer, Ralph M. Easley, was the secretary, now enlarged its scope in\r\nthe political field and issued a \"Call for a National Conference on\r\nPractical Primary Election Reform,\" in the name of some two hundred and\r\nfifty of the leading men of New York, Chicago, San Francisco, and\r\nthirty-five cities in between. Prominent in this list I remember Mayor\r\nWilliam L. Strong, of New York; ex-Mayor Abram S. Hewitt, of New York;\r\nDarwin R. James, president of the New York Board of Trade; Andrew B.\r\nHumphreys, of the Allied Political Clubs of New York; Mayor Josiah\r\nQuincy, of Boston; Mayor James D. Phelan, of San Francisco; ex-Mayor\r\nGeorge W. Ochs, of Chattanooga; Albert Shaw; Nicholas Murray Butler;\r\nCarl Schurz; Lyman Abbott; Lyman J. Gage; Melville E. Stone; Myron T.\r\nHerrick; Albert J. Beveridge; Robert M. La Follette.\r\n\r\nThe meeting was held in the rooms of the New York Board of Trade on\r\nJanuary 20, 1898, and we organized the National Primary Election League.\r\nI was elected president; Josiah Quincy, first vice-president; Charles\r\nEmory Smith, of Philadelphia, second vice-president; Walter C. Flower,\r\nof New Orleans, third vice-president; Ralph M. Easley, secretary; and\r\nDarwin R. James, treasurer. The conference gave a distinct impetus to\r\nprimary reform all over the country, and in many of the States led to\r\nthe passage of laws providing for such reforms.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the presidential election of 1896 I voted for McKinley, despite my\r\nformer political affiliations. The outstanding issue between the\r\nRepublican and Democratic Parties was the money question, and I was an\r\nadvocate of sound money.\r\n\r\nEarly in the new Administration our relations with Spain were rapidly\r\ndrifting to a crisis over conditions in Cuba. My friend General Stewart\r\nL. Woodford was appointed minister to Spain. I gave him a letter of\r\nintroduction to Sir Henry Drummond Wolff, who was now British ambassador\r\nat Madrid. Wolff was very sympathetic toward America. Woodford later\r\ninformed me that the letter had been very serviceable, especially as his\r\naudience had been delayed for several weeks on account of the Queen's\r\nabsence from the capital. He very frankly laid before Wolff the American\r\nposition and attitude with regard to Cuba, which Wolff asked permission\r\nto detail to his Government. Based on that information the British\r\ndiplomatic representatives were advised by Lord Salisbury: \"The\r\nAmerican cause is absolutely impregnable; govern yourselves\r\naccordingly.\"\r\n\r\nPresident McKinley frequently invited me to Washington and encouraged my\r\nwriting to him, especially on international matters; and my letters\r\nalways received prompt reply over his own signature. Accordingly on\r\nMarch 12, 1898, I wrote him at length stating that perhaps the impending\r\nwar with Spain could be averted if we proposed to Spain a plan of\r\nsuzerainty. I quote from my letter:\r\n\r\n     We have no need for Cuba; our destinies point to the Continent; to\r\n     leave it to make conquests will weaken our rights, ... and will\r\n     place us against our will on the world's chessboard, from which we\r\n     have happily kept clear. The Cuban insurgents are imbued with a\r\n     spirit of belligerency, but have neither past training nor the\r\n     knowledge to maintain freedom and to accord to each other\r\n     individual liberty.\r\n\r\n     The great problems, I take it, are, first: to stop the war;\r\n     secondly, to find a solution which will bring independence to Cuba,\r\n     and at the same time preserve the _amour propre_ to Spain.... The\r\n     proposition to which I have given considerable thought ... is the\r\n     following:\r\n\r\n     That we insist that Spain accord and Cuba accept the position of\r\n     suzerainty such as are the relations between Turkey and Egypt. This\r\n     will give Cuba self-government, and will at the same time preserve\r\n     the _amour propre_ of Spain by retaining a semblance of a claim of\r\n     sovereignty without power to interfere with self-government on the\r\n     part of the Cubans.... We could much better afford to help Cuba\r\n     with a number of millions which would after all be a small fraction\r\n     of what a war would cost us, ... especially when the end attained\r\n     is the independence of Cuba, and attained in such a way as not to\r\n     entail upon us unending responsibilities full of care and\r\n     entangling obligations.\r\n\r\nImmediately upon receipt of this the President asked me to come to\r\nWashington for a conference. He was very much interested in the idea and\r\nrequested me to write out the plan in more detail. This I did. I\r\ndiscussed with him the suzerainty plan as developed in Europe and as it\r\nwas working in Egypt. I expressed the opinion that as the leading\r\nnations of Europe were familiar with the idea it was not likely to meet\r\nwith any serious objections. McKinley was impressed with the feasibility\r\nof my proposal and was in favor of some such arrangement. He said he was\r\nhaving difficulty because of the jingo agitation in Congress and the\r\nstorming for war of the American press. He felt when the report of the\r\nBoard of Inquiry on the destruction of the Maine was made public, as it\r\nwould be in a few days, nothing could hold back Congress and the press,\r\nand the Cuban controversy would be pushed to an issue.\r\n\r\nHowever, he immediately communicated the plan to Minister Woodford, who\r\nbrought it to the attention of the Spanish Government. General Woodford\r\nreported that he had every reason to believe it would be acceptable to\r\nSpain. But meantime things moved with lightning speed and war was\r\ndeclared.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRESIDENT McKINLEY SENDING THE AUTHOR TO TURKEY ON HIS\r\nSECOND MISSION, 1898]\r\n\r\nMatters in Turkey at this time were also not going very smoothly. At a\r\nconference with McKinley one day he showed me a communication from Dr.\r\nJames B. Angell, minister at the Porte, suggesting that the only way to\r\nbring Turkey to terms was to send warships up there and \"rattle the\r\nSultan's windows.\" The President was much disturbed. He felt the sending\r\nof warships might result in another incident like the blowing up of the\r\nMaine. He said the situation had worried him so that it interfered with\r\nhis sleep, and he begged me to accept again the appointment of minister\r\nto Turkey, declaring with conviction that he regarded me as the only man\r\nwho could adjust the situation. I explained to him frankly how I was\r\nsituated in regard to my business obligations and that it was very\r\ndifficult for me to drop them at this time; but under the circumstances\r\nas he had stated them to me I felt I had no right to interpose my\r\npersonal affairs as a reason for refusing, for I certainly regarded no\r\nsacrifice too great to make in the service of the country when it was\r\nneeded, as in this instance. I said I had been too young to shoulder a\r\ngun in the Civil War as he had done, but with a full understanding of my\r\nsituation if he should feel it necessary to call upon me I should be at\r\nhis service.\r\n\r\nDr. Angell was a distinguished scholar and not lacking in diplomatic\r\nexperience. He was president of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor,\r\nand had been special envoy to China. He was also an adviser and one of\r\nthe trustees of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign\r\nMissions. However, in some public utterance he had criticized Turkey\r\nunfavorably, and the Porte was having its revenge. Every request Dr.\r\nAngell made was declined; exequaturs were refused to our consuls\r\nappointed at Erzerum and Harpoot. Dr. Angell was discouraged and\r\nincensed. He was about to resign.\r\n\r\nFinally one day I received a telegram:\r\n\r\n                                               EXECUTIVE MANSION\r\n                                                  WASHINGTON, D.C.\r\n                                                       _May 27_, 1898\r\n\r\n     HONORABLE OSCAR S. STRAUS\r\n         New York\r\n\r\n     Remembering our talk of a few months ago I would be glad to have\r\n     you accept the post of Minister to Turkey. Dr. Angell has resigned\r\n     to take effect 15 of August. I would be pleased to nominate you\r\n     before Senate adjourns.\r\n\r\n                                              WILLIAM MCKINLEY\r\n\r\nAnd I telegraphed back that same day:\r\n\r\n        PRESIDENT MCKINLEY\r\n           Executive Mansion\r\n               Washington\r\n\r\n     Your request that I should accept the post of Minister to Turkey,\r\n     with which you honor me, I regard as a command, and deem it my\r\n     patriotic duty to you and to the country to accept.\r\n\r\n                                                    OSCAR S. STRAUS\r\n\r\nAmong the telegrams and letters of congratulation I received was one\r\nfrom William L. Wilson, then the president of Washington and Lee\r\nUniversity at Lexington, Virginia, reading: \"Washington and Lee greets\r\nyou as Doctor of Laws.\"\r\n\r\nThe National Civic Club of Brooklyn gave me a dinner and reception,\r\npresided over by my friend and college mate, Frederic W. Hinrichs, at\r\nwhich the leading speaker was Dr. St. Clair McKelway, editor of the\r\n\"Brooklyn Eagle.\" During the evening a letter was received from my\r\nformer chief and Secretary of State, Thomas F. Bayard, saying:\r\n\r\n     It was my good fortune to be associated with Mr. Straus when he\r\n     first took up the tangled web of Turkish diplomacy, so that few\r\n     persons can so well attest as I, his possession of those talents\r\n     and high personal characteristics which give him weight everywhere.\r\n\r\nEx-President Cleveland, who was prevented from being present by another\r\nengagement, wrote:\r\n\r\n     I would be glad to join those who will do honor to Mr. Straus ...\r\n     and thus show my appreciation of his usefulness and the worth of\r\n     his good example in recognizing the demands of good citizenship and\r\n     responding to the call of public duty.\r\n\r\nAnd there were also messages from many others, including President\r\nMcKinley.\r\n\r\nI did not leave for my post for several months. Meanwhile I had more\r\nconferences with the President regarding the Spanish situation. Early\r\nin August, in discussing pending Spanish peace negotiations, he wanted\r\nmy ideas regarding them and as to how much of the Philippines we should\r\ntake. I strongly advised that we take as little as possible--nothing\r\nmore than a naval and coaling station; otherwise to appropriate the\r\nPhilippines would in the long run entail endless obligations without\r\ncommensurate benefits. I told him I believed these to be the views also\r\nof many of the more thoughtful citizens, and that I had spoken with a\r\nnumber of prominent men, such as ex-Postmaster-General Wilson,\r\nex-Secretary of the Treasury Carlisle, and Clifton R. Breckinridge,\r\nformerly of the Ways and Means Committee, all of whom were of like\r\nopinion. The President seemed to appreciate my view, but again feared\r\nthe jingo spirit of Congress. He complained also of the attitude of the\r\nCuban insurgents, who were exaggerating their numbers as well as their\r\ndemands.\r\n\r\nTurning for a moment to my appointment, he said: \"I don't know whether\r\nyou know it, but your nomination has been received with more praise by\r\nall parties throughout the country than any nomination to office I have\r\nmade since I am President.\" I assured him I was gratified, but realized\r\nthe emphasis this put upon my responsibilities.\r\n\r\nBecause I had been a Cleveland Democrat my appointment by a Republican\r\nPresident had, of course, created a great sensation in the press; it was\r\nheralded as a step toward the merit system in our foreign service.\r\n\r\nJohn Bassett Moore was now assistant Secretary of State, and with him I\r\nspent several days in the preparation of my instructions. I considered\r\nhim even then the best equipped authority on international law in the\r\ncountry, and I thought it was a pity his services could not be retained\r\nin the Department of State; but his salary there was five hundred\r\ndollars a year less than as professor, and he had a family to support.\r\nHe told me that the President and Secretary Day wished him to accompany\r\nthe Peace Commission to Paris, and subsequently he went as secretary and\r\ncounsel.\r\n\r\nWhile I was with the President for a final conference a week before\r\nsailing, Attorney-General Griggs came in all aglow and announced with\r\nmuch enthusiasm that he had just had a telephone message from Justice\r\nWhite (Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court, later Chief\r\nJustice) that he would consent to be one of the members of the Spanish\r\nAmerican Peace Commission. That specially pleased the President because\r\nWhite was a man of great ability, and because the fact that White was a\r\nCatholic might make a more favorable impression upon Catholic Spain. The\r\nPresident immediately directed that the names be given to the press.\r\nShortly thereafter, however, White reconsidered his acceptance, for\r\nreasons which were not made public, and Senator George Gray, who was\r\nserving as a member of the Quebec Commission, and who like White was a\r\nDemocrat, was prevailed upon by the President to accept in his stead.\r\nThe other members were all Republicans. The commission as finally\r\nconstituted was: Secretary of State William R. Day, Senator Cushman K.\r\nDavis (chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee of the Senate),\r\nSenator William P. Frye, Senator George Gray, and Whitelaw Reid.\r\n\r\nThere was considerable clamor, from missionaries and others, that we\r\nsend warships to Turkey. Of this I entirely disapproved and so told the\r\nPresident. He answered me: \"I shall be guided by you; I shall support\r\nyou; I have confidence in your ability and foresight. No vessels will\r\nbe sent to Turkey unless you demand them, and then, only then, will they\r\nbe sent. And when you get to London I wish you to see Ambassador\r\nHay\"--Hay was about to return to take up the post of Secretary of\r\nState--\"and tell him that I have not only constituted you Minister to\r\nTurkey, but Secretary of State for Turkey, and that both he and I will\r\nbe guided entirely by your judgment and advice.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nMY SECOND MISSION TO TURKEY\r\n\r\n     Conferences with Ambassador Hay and Dr. Angell in London regarding\r\n     Turkish matters--I make suggestions for cooerdinating work in our\r\n     diplomatic service--With Baroness de Hirsch in Vienna--Arrival at\r\n     Constantinople; audience with the Sultan--The visit of the Emperor\r\n     and Empress of Germany--Breaking Turkish passport regulations--The\r\n     Porte refuses to negotiate a treaty of naturalization--The\r\n     indemnities for missionaries at Harpoot and Marash; the Sultan\r\n     admits claim and promises to pay; I obtain irade for rebuilding\r\n     college at Harpoot--The Philippine Mohammedans; a diplomatic\r\n     romance--American flour cheapens bread in Turkey--Aid to the\r\n     British ambassador in the protection of Armenian orphanages--A\r\n     renegade Roman priest--Lord Rosebery--Dr. S. Weir Mitchell--The\r\n     Sultan entertains American tourists--His Majesty's only smile--A\r\n     visit to Athens--Happy days on the Bosphorus--The Sultan's gift of\r\n     vases--Dr. Theodor Hertzl--A visit to Rome--I return to Washington\r\n     and conduct negotiations from there--LL.D. from Pennsylvania\r\n     University--I end my mission.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn London I had several conferences with Ambassador John Hay, who was\r\nshortly to return to Washington as Secretary of State in the place of\r\nWilliam R. Day, chosen to head the Spanish-American Peace Commission at\r\nParis. Mr. Day a few years afterward was made associate justice of the\r\nUnited States Supreme Court, and the duties of that post he still\r\ndischarges with distinction.\r\n\r\nMr. Hay and I went over in detail the questions at issue in Turkey and\r\nthe plans I proposed for their adjustment. I told him of the pressure\r\nbeing brought upon the President to send warships to the Bosphorus, and\r\nsaid I regarded such a course as mixing up in the Eastern question, that\r\ntraditional tinder box of Europe, aside from the possible danger of\r\nanother incident like the blowing-up of the Maine. Mr. Hay agreed and\r\npromised to support me to the fullest extent in settling matters with\r\nTurkey.\r\n\r\nI also met Dr. Angell in London on his way back from Constantinople, and\r\nwent over matters with him. He told me what a fruitless year and a half\r\nhe had had there and how he was made to feel he was _persona non grata_.\r\nHe had not been invited to dine at the Palace once during his entire\r\nstay.\r\n\r\nBefore I left London I had a call from William E. Dodge, of Phelps,\r\nDodge, & Company, New York, and president of the Evangelical Alliance of\r\nAmerica. He came to express his appreciation for my making the personal\r\nand business sacrifice to go to Turkey again. He was one of our most\r\nbenevolent citizens, prominently connected with the missionary bodies\r\nand therefore deeply interested in the American colleges and schools in\r\nthe Ottoman Empire.\r\n\r\nWhen I left for Constantinople this time, there were with me, besides my\r\nwife, my daughters, Aline and Mildred, respectively fourteen and fifteen\r\nyears old; my little son Roger, six and a half years old, and his nurse;\r\nmy niece Sissy, daughter of my brother Nathan; and my nephew Percy,\r\nsecond son of my brother Isidor, who was to be my private secretary.\r\nMildred we allowed to return from Paris to continue her studies at\r\nBarnard, as we were unable to find a suitable school for her in either\r\nEngland or France. We had sailed for Liverpool on the S.S. Lusitania on\r\nSeptember 3d.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy friend General Horace Porter had been appointed ambassador to France,\r\nand while in Paris I dined with him several times. He was a man of means\r\nand had located the embassy in a magnificent residence in one of the\r\nmost fashionable parts of Paris. There we met among others Ferdinand W.\r\nPeck, United States Commissioner to the Paris Exposition, and Mrs. Peck;\r\nalso William F. Draper, ambassador to Italy, who with Mrs. Draper was\r\nin Paris on a leave of absence.\r\n\r\nTo Messrs. Porter and Draper I proposed what I had felt the need for\r\nduring my earlier mission: some sort of cooerdination and cooperation\r\namong our various diplomatic representatives throughout Europe. I\r\nsuggested we might have conferences from time to time, or prevail upon\r\nthe State Department to keep each of us informed respecting negotiations\r\nbetween the Department and all the others. Much of this material would\r\nbe of interest and value to us in connection with our respective\r\nembassies or missions. It was being done by other foreign offices. The\r\nBritish Foreign Office, for instance, issues confidential communications\r\nin the form of blueprints, which are sent to the heads of all British\r\nmissions. During my previous sojourn at Constantinople my colleague, Sir\r\nWilliam White, frequently gave me the benefit of extracts from these\r\nblueprints referring to American matters. They were very informing and\r\nhelpful.\r\n\r\nPorter and Draper said they would cooperate with me in urging the State\r\nDepartment to adopt some such scheme, and when I wrote to our colleague\r\nat Berlin, Andrew D. White, he gave similar support. However, when I\r\nsuggested the idea to the State Department nothing came of it. Since\r\nthen some further effort has been made in that direction, but I have not\r\nlearned to what extent this desired system has been effected.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe went on to Vienna to meet Baroness de Hirsch, who was coming from her\r\nestate at Eichhorn. She had put her beautiful Paris residence on the rue\r\nd'Elysee at our disposal, but unfortunately my appointments made it\r\nimpossible for us to avail ourselves of her hospitality. The Baroness\r\nlooked ill to me, and I warned her against allowing her intense\r\noccupation with benevolent activities to wear upon her. She said she had\r\nhad the grippe, and later told my wife that her physicians feared her\r\nailment might be more serious. In spite of this, however, she went right\r\non, while at the Hotel Bristol in Vienna, with conferences with her\r\nalmoners, among others Ritter von Gutmann and Baron Guenzburg, who were\r\nassociated with her in her endowed enterprises in Austria and elsewhere.\r\nAlas, her malady was more serious than grippe, for it was only a short\r\ntime after our reaching Constantinople that her family informed us of\r\nher death.\r\n\r\nWe met some of the leading Jewish scholars, artists, and literary men\r\nwhile in Vienna: the architect, Wilhelm Stiassny; the actor, Adolf von\r\nSonnenthal; Dr. Adam Politzer; the Hungarian artists, Leopold Horowitz\r\nand Isidor Kaufmann; Professor David Heinrich Miller, of the Vienna\r\nUniversity; and the attorney, Dr. Adolph Stein. Herr Stiassny was\r\npresident of the Jewish Historical Society, and at a meeting of that\r\nbody at which I was present he referred in glowing terms to my\r\nappointment, saying that, amid the anti-Semitic spirit that was taking\r\nhold of Austria and other European countries, America had shown by my\r\nappointment that no race or religious distinction existed here, which\r\ncould not fail to have an influence in Austria and in several other\r\nEuropean states.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn arriving at Constantinople we were welcomed by the secretary of the\r\nlegation and acting charge, John W. Riddle, together with other members\r\nof the legation and consulate and several of the missionaries. Mr.\r\nRiddle, by the way, had conducted the affairs of the legation in the\r\ninterim with discretion and ability. He has since filled several other\r\nposts most creditably; he was ambassador to Russia under Roosevelt, and\r\nat the present writing is ambassador to Argentina.\r\n\r\nThe Minister of Foreign Affairs at the Porte now was Tewfik Pasha, who\r\nhad been ambassador to Germany. He spoke German better than French, so I\r\nconversed with him in the former language. As was customary, I left with\r\nhim the letters of recall of my predecessor and a copy of my\r\npresentation address. I was informed that the Sultan and all the\r\nofficials at the Porte were pleased at my return, because they knew me\r\nand had every confidence in me both personally and officially. Of\r\ncourse, these remarks may have been diplomatic politeness, but events\r\nseemed to show some sincerity in them. My audience, for instance,\r\ninstead of being delayed for weeks, was granted within one week of my\r\narrival; and instead of being accorded the lesser formalities of a\r\nminister, I was received with all the ceremony accorded an ambassador:\r\nfour state carriages were placed at my disposal, preceded by four\r\npostilions and outriders; a detachment of guards rendered military\r\nhonors as I arrived at the Palace; the Sultan was attended by Osman\r\nPasha, Fouad Pasha, general-in-chief of the Turkish armies, and some\r\nthirty other high civil and military officers.\r\n\r\nAfter the formality of presenting my credentials and making my address,\r\nthe Sultan reiterated three times that he felt great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming me back, as my former mission had given him much satisfaction.\r\nHe said that he knew I was a \"gentleman\"; and that is the only English\r\nword I had ever heard him use.\r\n\r\nPresident McKinley had authorized me to arrange for the elevation of the\r\nmission at Constantinople to an embassy, as by the Act of March 3, 1893,\r\nprovision was made for the appointment of ambassadors. Up to that time,\r\nbased on the idea that ambassadors represented the person of a monarch\r\nand that republics should not thus be represented, we had had only\r\nministers. The act reads:\r\n\r\n     Whenever the President shall be advised that any foreign government\r\n     is represented, or is about to be represented, in the United States\r\n     by an ambassador, envoy extraordinary, minister plenipotentiary,\r\n     minister resident, special envoy, or charge d'affaires, he is\r\n     authorized, in his discretion, to direct that the representative of\r\n     the United States to such government shall bear the same\r\n     designation.\r\n\r\nThe initiative for sending an ambassador, therefore, rested with the\r\nforeign power, and we could not send an ambassador to Turkey until that\r\nGovernment accredited an ambassador to us.\r\n\r\nDuring my audience I informed the Sultan that the President had said he\r\nwould be pleased to raise our mission to an embassy, but I observed that\r\nHis Majesty did not take kindly to the suggestion. He replied politely\r\nthat he would take it under consideration.\r\n\r\nAmong my colleagues, Baron Calice still represented Austria-Hungary.\r\nGermany was represented by Baron Marschall von Bieberstein, former\r\nPrussian minister, a large man of the von Moltke physique; he died later\r\nin London (1912) after a short service as ambassador to Britain. From\r\nFrance there was Paul Cambon, brother of Jules Cambon, who was\r\nambassador at Washington at the time of the Spanish-American War and\r\ncontinued the Spanish negotiations after our rupture with Spain; a\r\nlittle while after my arrival in Constantinople Paul Cambon was\r\ntransferred to London. From Great Britain there was Nicholas R. O'Conor,\r\nwhom I met during my former mission when he was consul-general and\r\ncharge at Sophia; he had meanwhile been ambassador to Russia. And from\r\nItaly there was Signor Pansa. Severally they informed me that since my\r\nfirst mission, ten years before, the power of the Ottoman Government\r\nhad been more and more concentrated in the Palace, that the Sultan\r\nhimself was the \"whole show\" and very little power was left at the\r\nPorte.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nConstantinople was all agog with preparation and excitement, for the\r\nEmperor and Empress of Germany were expected on October 17th! (As a\r\nmatter of fact, rough weather on the AEgean caused them to arrive a day\r\nlate.) The main streets of Pera were paved anew, and the walls\r\nsurrounding Yildis were newly whitewashed. All business at the Porte was\r\nsuspended. A Government official told me that the visit would probably\r\ncost the Ottoman Empire not less than five hundred thousand pounds! One\r\nof the residences at Yildis, near the Palace, was placed at the\r\nEmperor's disposal.\r\n\r\nAs is customary on such visits, all the heads of missions left their\r\ncards at the German embassy and inscribed their names in the Emperor's\r\nvisiting register. Each visit was promptly returned the next day by von\r\nBuelow, Minister of Foreign Affairs, who left his card.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor and Empress drove through Pera in state, preceded by a\r\ncompany of Turkish lancers and followed by numerous officers on horses\r\nand in carriages. They rode in the royal victoria, drawn by four horses,\r\naccompanied by numerous outriders in gala uniforms and on caparisoned\r\nhorses. The whole procession was gorgeous, and the royal pair bowed to\r\nleft and right as the crowds in the streets greeted them.\r\n\r\nSome time after midnight on October 20-21 the doorbell rang and my\r\nportier brought me a communication, just received from the Grand Master\r\nof Ceremonies at the Palace, inviting Mrs. Straus, myself, and our first\r\ndragoman to the banquet to the German Emperor and Empress at 7.15\r\no'clock on the evening of the 21st. The doyen of the diplomatic corps\r\nhad sent suggestions that the ladies wear high neck and long sleeves, as\r\nthe Sultan objected to the regulation European evening dress. The ladies\r\naccordingly contrived to cover their necks and arms with chiffons,\r\nlaces, and long gloves. It proved unnecessary, however, because the\r\nEmpress and her ladies-in-waiting wore the usual decollete.\r\n\r\nIn the recollection of the oldest diplomats present, this banquet was\r\nthe most brilliant in its appointments that had ever been given at the\r\nPalace. More than one hundred persons were there, all the heads of\r\nmissions and the leading officials of the empire. The approach to the\r\nPalace for quite a distance was illuminated and lined on both sides of\r\nthe way with rows of soldiers. At the Palace entrance, where we were met\r\nby the court officials, we passed between rows of magnificently\r\nuniformed Turkish and German officers, each wearing his full regalia of\r\nnumerous decorations.\r\n\r\nAt the proper time we were ushered into the audience room, where the\r\ndiplomats and their wives were arranged in a circle, the ladies on one\r\nside and the gentlemen on the other. When the Emperor and Empress with\r\nthe Sultan entered, every one made a court bow. The Sultan and the\r\nEmperor then engaged in conversation through an interpreter in the\r\ncenter of the circle, while the Empress greeted each lady individually.\r\nEach person, as was the custom, bowed before and after being spoken to.\r\nWhen the Empress had greeted all the ladies and started with the\r\ngentlemen, the Emperor started with the ladies.\r\n\r\nWhen he came to Mrs. Straus, he made some mention of having seen her\r\nqueen lately and that she was as beautiful as ever. Mrs. Straus, by way\r\nof indicating that she was from the United States, said, \"I suppose Your\r\nMajesty refers to Mrs. McKinley\"; but the Emperor, evidently without\r\nstopping to listen to what was being said, clicked his heels, made his\r\ncourtesy, and greeted the next person. It seems on being introduced he\r\nhad misunderstood \"Roumanie\" for \"Etats-Unis,\" especially since Mrs.\r\nStraus was next to the Serbian minister's wife. Count Eulenburg later\r\nexplained to Mrs. Straus that the Emperor's hearing was a little\r\ndefective.\r\n\r\nWhen the Emperor reached me, he at once expressed a keen desire that it\r\nmight be possible for him to visit my country, and especially our great\r\nshipyards, such as those of Cramp, which he had heard were wonderful. He\r\nthen asked me whether I knew our ambassador at Berlin, Andrew D. White;\r\nand when I informed him that Mr. White had been a friend of mine for a\r\nnumber of years, he said a few complimentary words about him.\r\n\r\nThe dinner service included gold plates and gold knives and forks. The\r\nwaiters wore brilliant red and gold uniforms. Between courses the Sultan\r\nand the Emperor conversed by means of the interpreter who stood behind\r\nthem, and until they had finished talking the waiters were patiently\r\nholding the next course up in the air for a cooling.\r\n\r\nAfter the dinner we again formed a circle, made more courtesies at the\r\nproper time, while the Sultan himself went round and greeted and shook\r\nhands with each one. That ended the royal dinner.\r\n\r\nDuring the meal I sat next to the Emperor's personal physician, Dr.\r\nLidhold. He had held the same position under the late Frederick III,\r\nwhom he characterized as a most lovable man. He said William II was\r\nactive and fond of amusing himself, and enjoyed constantly traveling\r\nabout, which was not so pleasant for his physician and other members of\r\nhis train. He admitted that the Emperor's left arm was quite lame, but\r\nit did not interfere much with his movements because he had acquired\r\nsuch dexterity with the other. He added that the magnificent attentions\r\nof the Sultan could not fail to have a great influence upon Germany's\r\nattitude toward the Ottoman Empire.\r\n\r\nThe visit of the Emperor at this time, following as it did the dreadful\r\nmassacre of Armenians only a few years before at Harpoot and then at\r\nConstantinople itself, was very much resented by the Christians\r\nthroughout Europe. It was interpreted as an effort on the part of the\r\nEmperor, for his own gain, to reinstate the \"bloody Sultan\" in the\r\nesteem of the world. It was stated that the Sultan presented the Empress\r\nwith a very costly string of pearls.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne of the four outstanding questions included in my instructions\r\nconcerned the right of our citizens to travel in the interior of Turkey.\r\nFollowing the Armenian massacres of 1896 the Turkish Government made new\r\npassport regulations, and all foreigners were required to get a\r\ntezkirah, or special local passport, from the Sultan before traveling\r\ninto the interior. As usual in Turkey, asking for a permit of any kind\r\nwas one thing; getting it was quite another. This regulation proved most\r\nobstructive to our missionaries and those of Great Britain who had\r\nmissions in the interior. They would go home or to Europe on a leave of\r\nabsence, and upon returning to Constantinople would be held up,\r\nsometimes for weeks, on account of these tezkirahs, which were not\r\ndefinitely refused, but not given, which practically amounted to the\r\nsame thing.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived at Constantinople eight Americans, bound for Erzerum and\r\nHarpoot, were being held up in this way. One of them was Dr. C. F.\r\nGates, president of the Euphrates College at Harpoot. After exhaustive\r\nnegotiations with the authorities, in which I pointed out the fact that\r\nrefusal of the tezkirah was in violation of treaty rights, I myself gave\r\nDr. Gates a permit, signed by me, with the seal of the legation on it. I\r\nthen informed the Porte of my action and said that if any injury befell\r\nthe party _en route_ I should hold the Turkish Government responsible. I\r\nalso sent an open cable to our State Department informing Secretary Hay\r\nwhat I had done. My British colleague was a bit disturbed when he heard\r\nof it, because there were several British missionaries in the party.\r\n\r\nThat same night I got another of those Turkish midnight messages. After\r\napologizing for disturbing me, the messenger brought me the intelligence\r\nthat my cable had been held back, and that the Minister of Foreign\r\nAffairs sent word that instructions had been given for the full\r\nprotection of the missionaries _en route_ to their posts. That broke\r\ndown the passport regulations, and a very few days thereafter I received\r\nnotice that the Council of Ministers had taken up the matter and ruled\r\nthat the regulations for traveling into the interior should be restored\r\nto what they were before the Armenian troubles.\r\n\r\nAt about the same time I was enabled to cable to our Department of State\r\nthat I had obtained the Sultan's irade granting the exequatur for our\r\nconsul at Erzerum.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe third item in my instructions, the Treaty of Naturalization, I had\r\nto drop. The Porte refused to negotiate this question because of the\r\nfailure of our Government to accept the terms I had obtained during my\r\nprevious mission, and for this I could not blame them. As during my\r\nearlier mission, when matters involving questions of naturalization\r\narose I succeeded in securing the rights of the persons concerned on the\r\nmerits of each individual case.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLastly there was the question of indemnities due missionaries at Harpoot\r\nand Marash for property, real and personal, plundered and destroyed\r\nduring the massacres. This was a delicate matter, because the Americans\r\nwere not alone in making claims for such damage; also the Government was\r\nvery poor. At first the Porte denied all liability and refused to pay. I\r\nstarted the negotiations in November, 1898, and the process proved a\r\nlong and tedious one, lasting over a year. But step by step progress was\r\nmade. By December the Sultan admitted the claims and promised to pay as\r\nsoon as the amount was fixed. By February, with the amount still\r\nunfixed, he had decided how payment was to be made: he would buy a\r\ncruiser in America, to the cost of which the indemnities could be added,\r\nenabling him to make payment \"behind a screen,\" which he preferred. He\r\nsaid arrangements were being made for loans through a bank in Paris to\r\nbegin installments on such a contract. By early September the irade for\r\nthe purchase of a ship from some American builder had been given, and\r\nplans were being studied to determine the type of ship. By the end of\r\nthe month the Sultan again assured me that the subject was receiving his\r\nattention and would be settled in a month or two.\r\n\r\nThe state of the Turkish finances was, of course, deplorable, and the\r\nMinister of Foreign Affairs told me that the Government was planning to\r\napply to the purchase of the ship, money coming due in two months upon\r\nthe conversion of some loans. And there were claims from England,\r\nFrance, Germany, and Italy, none of which the Sultan had recognized or\r\npromised to pay.\r\n\r\nEven so, I planned that if His Majesty showed a disposition to deny his\r\npromise I should offer to arbitrate and thus bring matters to a head.\r\nThat would put him upon one of two horns of a dilemma: if he accepted,\r\nit definitely and authoritatively exposed to all the world the horrible\r\ndetails of the massacre; if he refused, it put him in the position of\r\nhaving declined the only peaceful method of adjustment. Tewfik Pasha,\r\nhowever, in the name of the Sultan continued to make promises of\r\npayment, and the matter dragged along a few months more.\r\n\r\nHaving settled all other problems that were irritating the relations of\r\nthe two Governments, I asked for leave to visit the United States. I\r\nplanned this trip so as to accentuate our displeasure at the\r\nprocrastination of the Ottoman Government in settling the indemnities,\r\nand notified the Minister of Foreign Affairs that as my Government had\r\nbeen patient for over a year I should now return home for consultation\r\nregarding the delay.\r\n\r\nUpon my return to the United States I carried on the negotiations\r\nthrough the Turkish minister at Washington and prepared the instructions\r\nfor our charge at Constantinople through the State Department. This\r\nfinally resulted in a contract with the Cramp Shipbuilding Corporation,\r\nwith an additional amount of ninety-five thousand dollars to pay the\r\nindemnity claims, though actual payment was not made until June, 1901,\r\nunder the incumbency of John G. Leishman, my successor.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the indemnity negotiations I succeeded in obtaining\r\nthe Sultan's irade for the rebuilding of college and missionary\r\nbuildings at Harpoot which had been injured or destroyed during the\r\nmassacres.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the interesting episodes during these fifteen months at\r\nConstantinople was what might be termed a diplomatic romance. In the\r\nspring of 1899 I received a letter from Secretary Hay enclosing a\r\ncommunication from William E. Curtis, Washington correspondent of the\r\n\"Chicago Record,\" and one of the best-known syndicate writers of the\r\ntime, who was well informed regarding what was going on in both official\r\nand unofficial circles at Washington. Curtis reported a conversation\r\nwith an important official of the Turkish legation wherein he learned\r\nthat since the Turko-Greek War the Sultan had regained authority and\r\nrespect among Mussulmans throughout the world, and his advisers thought\r\nthe time propitious for him, as the religious head of Islam, to make\r\nknown his authority to the Mohammedans of the Philippines, Java, and\r\nneighboring islands. The official had gone on to say that our victories\r\nover Spain had surprised the Sultan beyond description, and he was\r\nanxious to cultivate the friendship of a government whose navy could\r\nsink the enemy's fleet and go round the world without the loss of a man.\r\n\r\nCurtis thought that, in view of our present minister's influence and our\r\ngood relations with the Turkish Government, the Sultan under the\r\ncircumstances might be prevailed upon to instruct the Mohammedans of the\r\nPhilippines, who had always resisted Spain, to come willingly under our\r\ncontrol. Secretary Hay said he would give me no advice or instructions,\r\nbut would leave to my judgment what, if any, action I might deem it wise\r\nto take; that if I could succeed in getting the Sultan of Turkey to send\r\na message to the Sultan of the Sulu Islands which would result in\r\npeaceful and harmonious relations between the Sulu Sultan and our\r\nofficers, it would of course be a great accomplishment. The subject\r\ninterested me greatly. I saw the possibility of rendering an effective\r\nservice, and I was fascinated by the romance of the suggestion.\r\n\r\nWhen I went to Turkey on my first mission, my father placed his hands\r\nupon my head, gave me his blessing, and a parting advice which sank deep\r\ninto my consciousness: \"When you have an important matter coming before\r\nyou, don't act promptly, but sleep over it.\" My father's death in\r\nJanuary, 1898, accentuated this advice in my memory, and when I received\r\nthe Hay-Curtis letters I followed it. I knew very little about the\r\nPhilippines. I doubt that our State Department knew much more. The\r\nlibrary at Constantinople had nothing on the subject. I had a copy of\r\nthe testimony taken by our commissioners at the Paris peace\r\nnegotiations, but it contained only vaguest references. But one of my\r\ncolleagues had the works of Jean Jacques Reclus, the French geographer.\r\nFrom this I learned that the Mohammedans of the Philippines were not\r\nShiites, like those of Persia, but Sunnites, and therefore recognized\r\nthe Sultan of Turkey as their spiritual head.\r\n\r\nI thought about the problem for a few days, and then I sent a note to\r\nthe Palace that I should like to have an audience with His Majesty, as I\r\nhad some private communication to make to him that I believed might\r\ninterest him, for it would enable him to render a great service to a\r\nsection of his co-religionists. The audience was promptly arranged, and\r\nI gathered that the Sultan knew very little about the Sulu Mohammedans.\r\nHe asked regarding their sect. I told him they were Sunnites. He asked\r\nwhether they made pilgrimages to Mecca. I told him I thought they did,\r\nthe same as those of Borneo.\r\n\r\nThen a curious incident occurred. In order to be able to take up the\r\nmatter very fully with the Sultan, I had anticipated all kinds of\r\nquestions and armed myself with pertinent information. Among them I\r\nthought he might seek some assurance as to our Government's attitude\r\ntoward Mohammedanism, and to reassure him I had come prepared with a\r\ntranslation into Turkish of Article XI of an early treaty between the\r\nUnited States and Tripoli, negotiated by Joel Barlow in 1796. It read:\r\n\r\n     As the Government of the United States of America is not in any\r\n     sense founded on the Christian Religion; as it has in itself no\r\n     character of enmity against the laws, religion, or tranquility of\r\n     Musselman; and as the said States never have entered into any war\r\n     or act of hostility against any Mehomitan nation, it is declared by\r\n     the parties, that no pretext arising from religious opinions shall\r\n     ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the\r\n     two countries.\r\n\r\nWhen the Sultan had read this, his face lighted up. It would give him\r\npleasure, he said, to act in accordance with my suggestions, for two\r\nreasons: for the sake of humanity, and to be helpful to the United\r\nStates. He added that he hoped his services would be appreciated, and\r\nthat when occasion presented itself a like friendly spirit would be\r\nshown to him. He knew I was a \"gentleman\" and would make known to my\r\nGovernment the spirit in which he met my suggestions. The Mohammedans in\r\nquestion recognized him as khalif of the Moslems and he felt sure they\r\nwould follow his advice.\r\n\r\nWe discussed means of conveying his message to them, and finally decided\r\nto send a telegram to Mecca, where the Moslem pilgrims were then\r\ngathered, to ascertain if any Sulu chiefs were there. Before\r\ntransmitting it, His Majesty's secretary read the telegram to me in\r\ntranslation.\r\n\r\nTwo days later the Sultan invited me to the Palace to inform me that he\r\nhad received a reply that two Sulu chiefs were at Mecca. Another\r\ntelegram was then formulated instructing the chiefs in the name of the\r\nSultan that a definite understanding had been reached with the American\r\nElchi Bey (American minister) that they would not be disturbed in the\r\npractice of their religion if they would promptly place themselves under\r\nthe control of the American army; that because of the Sultan's deep\r\nconcern for their welfare he advised and instructed them to return at\r\nonce to their people to prevent any bloodshed.\r\n\r\nImmediately I cabled Secretary Hay, that he might be able to advise\r\nGeneral Bates, one of our commanders in the Philippines. The negotiation\r\nproved to be very important and valuable to us. Some three months later\r\nour Government received word from the Philippines that an\r\ninsurrectionist leader, Aguinaldo, had sent emissaries among these Sulu\r\nMohammedans, but they had refused to join the insurrectionists and had\r\nplaced themselves under the control of our army, thereby recognizing\r\nAmerican sovereignty.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-Colonel John P. Finley, who had been governor of the District\r\nof Zamboanga, Moro Province, of the Philippine Islands for ten years,\r\nwrote an article for the April, 1915, issue of \"The Journal of Race\r\nDevelopment\" in which he refers to this incident:\r\n\r\n     At the beginning of the war with Spain the United States Government\r\n     was not aware of the existence of any Mohammedans in the\r\n     Philippines. When this fact was discovered and communicated to our\r\n     ambassador in Turkey, Oscar S. Straus, of New York, he at once saw\r\n     the possibilities which lay before us of a holy war.... He sought\r\n     and gained an audience with the Sultan, Abdul Hamid, and requested\r\n     him as Caliph of the Moslem religion to act in behalf of the\r\n     followers of Islam in the Philippines.... A telegram to Mecca\r\n     elicited the fact that they not only visited Mecca in considerable\r\n     numbers, but that at that very time there were Moros from Sulu in\r\n     the Sacred City.... The Sultan as Caliph caused a message to be\r\n     sent to the Mohammedans of the Philippine Islands forbidding them\r\n     to enter into any hostilities against the Americans, inasmuch as no\r\n     interference with their religion would be allowed under American\r\n     rule.\r\n\r\n     President McKinley sent a personal letter of thanks to Mr. Straus\r\n     for the excellent work he had done, and said its accomplishment had\r\n     saved the United States at least twenty thousand troops in the\r\n     field. If the reader will pause to consider what this means in men\r\n     and also the millions in money, he will appreciate this wonderful\r\n     piece of diplomacy in averting a holy war.\r\n\r\nThere was one commercial trouble to be attended to, in the settlement of\r\nwhich I nevertheless emphasized the human aspect. Bread was, of course,\r\none of the main staples of the people, and it was rising in price. There\r\nwas a shortage of flour, yet a shipment of twenty thousand bags from the\r\nPillsbury-Washburn Flour Company of Minneapolis had been rejected. The\r\nreason given was that it did not contain a sufficient percentage of\r\ngluten and elasticity.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, a shipment received six months before had had the\r\neffect of reducing the retail price of bread about thirty-three per\r\ncent. Such shipments competed with the local flour mills, whose owners,\r\nchiefly Greeks, thereafter paid liberal baksheesh (tips, or bribe money)\r\nto have the flour rejected.\r\n\r\nI secured expert testimony to show that the flour, instead of being\r\ninferior, was far superior to the local flour. I made the issue urgent\r\nand sent an open telegram to our State Department that the flour was\r\nbeing refused admission in distinct violation of our treaty rights. This\r\nhad the effect I anticipated. The flour was admitted.\r\n\r\nThe result of this negotiation was reflected in every household, and was\r\nsignificant especially for the poorer people, who were grateful to the\r\nAmerican legation and the American people for further reducing the price\r\nof their bread. After this, other large shipments of flour arrived from\r\ntime to time and were admitted without difficulty.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe British ambassador came to me one day to ask whether, in view of the\r\nsuccess I had had in opening and protecting American schools, I could\r\ngive him some assistance in the protection of the orphanages which\r\nBritish benevolent societies had established following the Armenian\r\nmassacres. The Duke of Westminster had called the attention of Her\r\nMajesty's Government to the Porte's ruthless closing of a number of\r\nthese orphanages.\r\n\r\nAlthough it was not a matter that came officially under my jurisdiction,\r\nI told my colleague I should be glad to aid in every way possible. I\r\ncalled on the Grand Vizier and explained to him that if the Government\r\npersisted in destroying these institutions for the protection of orphan\r\nchildren, it would have a prejudicial effect in aggravating the\r\njustified horror produced in America as well as in England by those\r\nmassacres. I stated frankly that while this was not an American\r\nquestion, it would, none the less, from a humanitarian standpoint,\r\ncreate a disastrous impression to the further disadvantage of the\r\nTurkish Government.\r\n\r\nWe got the desired result. It so pleased my colleague that in reporting\r\nto Lord Salisbury he expressed great appreciation for the valuable help\r\nI had given him. This recognition was widely published, in the London\r\n\"Times\" and other British papers, as well as throughout America. The\r\nGermans also reaped some benefit, for several of the orphanages, as at\r\nPalu and Diarbekir, were under the supervision of their nationals.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOccasionally in the City of the Sultan there arose strange and peculiar\r\nincidents. I had a call one day from Monsignor Bonetti, the papal\r\ndelegate, who had a summer residence near mine. He said it had been\r\nreported to him that a Roman priest named Brann, who had left his\r\nposition in America about a year before because of some moral\r\ndelinquencies, had arrived in Turkey within a few days. He was doubtless\r\nunder an assumed name, but Bonetti had heard that the renegade priest\r\nwas among our missionaries, and requested that I make inquiry. I asked\r\nhim what he proposed doing should the priest be found. He said he wanted\r\nto counsel him to return to the church. The missionaries with whom I\r\nspoke gave me every assistance, but the priest had evidently not come\r\namong them, for he could not be found.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA number of distinguished people, European and American, visited\r\nConstantinople during the winter of 1898-99. Lord Rosebery arrived in\r\nhis mother's yacht and was the guest of the British ambassador, Sir\r\nNicholas O'Conor. We had the pleasure of meeting him several times at\r\ndinner. In a conversation I had with him he expressed great admiration\r\nfor America and said that at one time he was on the point of becoming an\r\nAmerican. I remember particularly his remark to the effect that he\r\nbelieved America and England, by cooperating, would control the world\r\nfor the interests of the world, without having to fight a battle; that\r\nthe peace and welfare of the world were in their hands, and sooner or\r\nlater it must come.\r\n\r\nWe talked about our respective forms of government, parliamentary and\r\ncongressional. He thought McKinley wise in referring all questions,\r\nduring and since the Spanish-American War, to Congress. To quote his own\r\nwords: \"He is sailing on unknown seas, and it is wise to let the\r\nrepresentative body do the steering.\"\r\n\r\nHe asked whether I was an ambassador or a minister. I explained to him\r\nthat the President desired to raise the mission to an embassy, but as\r\nthe law stood we were dependent upon the initiative of the Sultan. He\r\nsaid that during his incumbency as prime minister he had much to do with\r\nhaving the United States name an ambassador to London; he took special\r\ncare that Great Britain should be the first nation to send an ambassador\r\nto Washington and to receive an American ambassador.\r\n\r\nHe spoke in a complimentary manner of Secretary Hay and said he should\r\nhave remained in London, especially as it seemed to be his preference.\r\nHe spoke of the ambassadorship of Edward J. Phelps and said he had heard\r\nhim make some of the ablest public speeches he ever listened to; they\r\nwere effective not only in what they expressed, but in their reserve. He\r\nthought public speaking in America was more finished than in England, of\r\na higher order or better grounded from the standpoint of oratory: \"We\r\ncan't speak as you do.\"\r\n\r\nI replied that one had only to point to him as an example to disprove\r\nthat complimentary comparison. But he thought hardly anybody ever read\r\nhis speeches.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. S. Weir Mitchell, of Philadelphia, and his wife, together with the\r\ngreat-grandson of Alexander Hamilton, Philip Schuyler, and his wife,\r\ncame to Constantinople. We saw much of them. The Mitchells had just lost\r\ntheir daughter.\r\n\r\nDr. Mitchell, who was regarded as the leading authority on nervous\r\ndiseases--if I mistake not it was he who first introduced the rest cure,\r\nat any rate so far as America is concerned--was very anxious to see\r\nsomething of a Turkish household, which was not easily possible by\r\nreason of the seclusion of Turkish women. It happened that Tewfik\r\nPasha, Minister of Foreign Affairs, had often spoken to me about the\r\nillness of his wife, who seemed to be suffering from some nervous\r\nailment. She was a German-Swiss whom he had married while ambassador at\r\nBerlin, but their _menage_ was kept purely Turkish. Here, then, was my\r\nopportunity to kill two birds with one stone: I should satisfy Dr.\r\nMitchell's curiosity by rendering Tewfik Pasha a service. In speaking to\r\nthe Pasha I explained, of course, that Dr. Mitchell would accept no fee,\r\nthat he would give his services as a favor to me and an act of courtesy\r\nto him. Dr. Mitchell was able to prescribe with excellent effect for\r\nMme. Tewfik, and the Pasha was very grateful indeed.\r\n\r\nDr. Mitchell and I went to the museum one afternoon to see two famous\r\nmarble tombs that had recently been unearthed at Sidon, upon discovery\r\nby Hamdy Bey, director of the museum. Both these tombs were supposed to\r\nbe of the best period of ancient Greece. One was known as the Alexander\r\ntomb because it portrayed in high bas-relief the battle of Issus and\r\nalso a hunting scene, in each of which one of the figures was identified\r\nas portraying Alexander. At first some scholars believed it to be the\r\ntomb of the monarch himself, but that seemed not to be correct, and it\r\nwas doubtless the tomb of one of his generals. The other tomb was of\r\nequal size and proportions, about five feet high and ten feet long.\r\nRound its four sides it had a number of figures of a woman in various\r\nphases of mourning, the same figure with varying expressions. This\r\nancient work of art appealed to the bereaved heart of Dr. Mitchell and\r\nhe sat before it for quite a while. Later he wrote an \"Ode to a Lycian\r\nTomb,\" one of the best, if not the best, of his poems. He sent me a copy\r\nwhen it was privately printed, and subsequently it appeared in the\r\n\"Century Magazine.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe inauguration of trips to the Orient by the Hamburg-American and the\r\nNorth German Lloyd Steamship Companies frequently brought hundreds of\r\nAmericans to Constantinople at a time. In March the S.S.\r\nAugusta-Victoria arrived with three hundred and fifty American visitors.\r\nThe Sultan was most gracious to them. Through one of his aides he asked\r\nme to invite them to Selamlik, after which he arranged a luncheon for\r\nthem on the grounds of the ambassadorial kiosque, and had them visit the\r\nroyal stables. When they left, the Sultan's aide carried on board the\r\nship for them a large assortment of delicious Turkish candies and\r\ncigarettes, which they appropriately acknowledged in a letter that I\r\ntransmitted to the Palace for them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom time to time, especially when the weather was fine, I attended\r\nSelamlik, as was customary among the diplomats. On one very beautiful\r\nFriday I took with me my little son Roger, then seven years old. It was\r\nthe Sultan's birthday and the pageant was exceptionally fine. From the\r\nwindow of the ambassadorial kiosque Roger leaned out as far as he\r\npossibly could to get a good view of the Sultan as he passed beneath in\r\nhis victoria. The Sultan bowed in acknowledgment of our greeting, when\r\nsuddenly Roger realized that he had not taken off his cap and pulled it\r\noff rather comically. This made the Sultan smile, and it was the only\r\ntime I ever saw his habitually sad face wreathed in a smile.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter a strenuous winter, replete with difficult and trying\r\nnegotiations, I took advantage of the invitation of M. Paul\r\nStefanovich-Schilizzi, a philanthropist of Greece, to visit him in\r\nAthens in May. He was a man of great wealth and beloved throughout the\r\nNear East by reason of his benevolence. It is his niece, who was a\r\nfrequent guest at our home, who recently married Eleutherios Venizelos,\r\nthe famous Greek statesman.\r\n\r\n_En route_ to Athens we stopped for several days at Smyrna, where we met\r\nKiamil Pasha, the Grand Vizier with whom I had so satisfactorily carried\r\non a number of important negotiations during my first mission. He was\r\nnow vali at Smyrna, highly regarded, and justly called the \"grand old\r\nman\" of Turkey, being about seventy-five years old. Amid the corruption\r\nof his time no one ever questioned his honesty. He had been grand vizier\r\nseveral times. He spoke English fluently, doubtless acquired in his\r\nyouth at Cyprus, where he was born.\r\n\r\nHe deplored the hopeless condition of affairs at Constantinople, where\r\nall the power had gradually been concentrated at the Palace. Thus the\r\ngrand vizierate became a post without power, which, he explained, did\r\nnot interest him any longer. Besides, he did not agree with the Sultan's\r\nmethods, though he was thoroughly loyal to Turkey. His sympathies, as\r\nbetween the contending powers, were with Great Britain; he believed good\r\nrelationship with her was the surest guarantee for the welfare of his\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nFrom Smyrna we took a ship for Piraeus, a sixteen-hour trip. There we\r\ntook a carriage, instead of the train, to Athens. We stayed at the Hotel\r\nGrande Bretagne, which was owned by our friend Stefanovich. It was, and\r\ndoubtless still is, the leading hotel on the square near the King's\r\npalace, and from the balcony of our rooms we had a clear view of the\r\nAcropolis.\r\n\r\nThis was our second visit to Athens. We had been there ten years before\r\nas guests at the beautiful residence of Dmitri Stefanovich-Schilizzi,\r\nbrother of Paul, where we were sumptuously entertained; we dined at the\r\npalace, attended several functions there, and met, at various social\r\ngatherings, the leading people of the city. This time, however, we came\r\nfor rest and recreation; we made no official calls, but spent the six\r\ndays or so visiting places of interest, chiefly the excavations that\r\nwere being made, and the museum.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nReturning we took a steamer direct for Constantinople. We had learned\r\nthat the Montenegrin portier in charge of our house at Pera had a slight\r\ncase of smallpox, so we went directly to our summer home at Yenikeui on\r\nthe Bosphorus, about a mile distant from Therapia where most of my\r\ncolleagues had their summer residences. We had succeeded in securing a\r\nhouse that was a veritable palace and admirably arranged for\r\nentertaining, so that we were well able to reciprocate the attentions of\r\nour colleagues and extend proper hospitalities. A wealthy Greek had\r\nconstructed and owned this mansion, but on account of some questionable\r\ndealings with the Palace involving large sums of money, he was a\r\nfugitive from Turkey.\r\n\r\nThe house was surrounded by a park of its own, fronting on the\r\nBosphorus. There were pomegranate and magnolia trees in bloom, under\r\nwhich we took our lunch. We had a launch that I named the Franklin, and\r\nit was one of the fastest on the Bosphorus, so that within an hour I\r\ncould readily be at the Porte to transact the business of the legation,\r\nalthough things are more quiet during the summer.\r\n\r\nAltogether that summer was thoroughly delightful. My brother Isidor and\r\nhis devoted wife had both joined us. My brother had had an attack of\r\ninfluenza and his health was not very good, so they had come to Europe\r\nto consult a distinguished specialist, Professor Erb, at Heidelberg.\r\nAfter completing the cure my brother came to Constantinople for rest and\r\nquiet with us. The climate on the Bosphorus is ideal, never very hot\r\nbecause of the constant cool breezes from the Black Sea. During that\r\nsummer there were only three days when the thermometer rose to ninety.\r\n\r\nEverything seemed to prosper with me. I had brought several important\r\nissues to a successful termination; our whole immediate family was\r\ntogether, for Mildred had come to spend her vacation with us; and I had\r\nthe pleasure of a visit from my dear brother and his wife. I recall no\r\nperiod of my life that was such a happy one.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nToward the end of the year I telegraphed to Washington for leave to\r\nreturn home. I had adjusted all the matters at issue between the two\r\nGovernments except the indemnity, so that I felt justified in leaving my\r\npost. I knew that I could rely on Lloyd C. Griscom, the secretary who\r\nwould be in charge, for a tactful and efficient handling of the affairs\r\nof the legation. The indemnity required only steady pressure and\r\npatience. As I have already stated I timed my return so as to make it\r\neffective in adding a little more pressure.\r\n\r\nWhen I was about to depart, the Sultan sent to my residence a pair of\r\nbeautiful vases, each several feet high, and artistically ornamented.\r\nThey were manufactured at the royal pottery which the Sultan had had\r\nestablished on the Palace grounds, and the workmanship was French. As\r\nthe question of cost did not enter into the manufacture, some wonderful\r\nproductions were turned out at this pottery, and the vases sent to me\r\nwere exceptionally fine specimens. I was very much embarrassed, yet I\r\ndid not want to give offense by refusing them. I sent Mr. Gargiulo, our\r\nveteran dragoman, to explain to the Sultan's secretary how much I\r\nappreciated this attention, but as I was not permitted to accept the\r\nvases for myself I would accept them for our National Museum at\r\nWashington. That pleased the Sultan, and the vases now have a place in\r\nour museum at the national capital.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs there was no need for hurrying home, we made a few stops on the way,\r\nfirst at Vienna. The papers announced our arrival at the Austrian\r\ncapital, and I received a note from Dr. Theodor Hertzl asking for an\r\nappointment. I was glad of the opportunity to meet him, for I had read\r\nmuch about him. I found him a man of attractive appearance: a little\r\nabove medium height, coal-black beard and hair, very dark, expressive,\r\nbright eyes. He was about forty years old, seemed full of energy,\r\nbeaming with idealism, but a man of the world. He did not at all impress\r\none as a religious fanatic.\r\n\r\nHe said the idea of Zionism, or, rather, the colonization of oppressed\r\nJews, had been developing in his mind for ten or twelve years. I told\r\nhim I was not a Zionist, though I did not want him to understand that I\r\nwas in any way opposed to the movement, or disposed carelessly to ignore\r\nthe solemn aspirations which the deeply religious members of my race had\r\nprayerfully nurtured in sorrow and suffering through the ages. In answer\r\nto his question whether the Sultan had ever spoken with me about the\r\nsubject, I told him he had not, as he probably understood it was not an\r\nAmerican question and did not in any way come under my jurisdiction. But\r\nI told Hertzl of my negotiations regarding the immigration of the Jews\r\nto Palestine during my first mission to Turkey, when I visited\r\nJerusalem.\r\n\r\nWe spoke of the condition brought about through the agitation of\r\nZionism, the immigration of hundreds of Jews without means into\r\nPalestine, where there was as yet no industry to enable them to make a\r\nlivelihood. He said he appreciated that and was doing everything in his\r\npower to prevent such immigration until a permit for a \"chartered\r\ncompany\" with sufficient capital had been obtained from the Sultan, and\r\nthat he was in correspondence with an official of the Porte for the\r\nsecuring of such a permit. I suggested that it might be best for him to\r\ngo to Constantinople and personally take up such negotiations; that I\r\nhad been shown a letter from him to Artin Effendi, the under-Secretary\r\nof State, and this man was one of the biggest rogues in the empire, an\r\nArmenian kept nominally in office by the Sultan to mislead and hold in\r\ncheck his oppressed co-religionists. Dr. Hertzl thought he might take my\r\nadvice.\r\n\r\nHe informed me that some months before, he had taken the matter up with\r\nthe German Emperor and was led to believe that the Emperor was not in\r\nany way opposed to Zionism, nor to the returning of the Jews to\r\nPalestine, but Dr. Hertzl feared the opposition of the Catholics. He\r\ngathered also, from what he had heard, that Russia did not oppose the\r\nplan.\r\n\r\nI mentioned Mesopotamia to him as a better place for the colonization of\r\nthe Jews than Palestine; it was the original home of Abraham and his\r\nprogenitors, was sparsely settled, and if the ancient canals were\r\nreopened that country could support several million people. He said he\r\nwas somewhat familiar with this idea, as well as with Professor Haupt's\r\npamphlet, and a scheme for the colonization of Cyprus, and that it was\r\nperhaps well to have more than one plan; if one did not serve as an\r\noutlet for emigration another might.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me that Hertzl was one of those men who, having capacity\r\nand idealism, attach themselves to a cause that appeals to their\r\nintellect or their sympathies, and grow in spirit and effectiveness\r\nthrough the intensity of their devotion. Such men often develop\r\nextraordinary qualities of true greatness under conditions that impose\r\nweighty responsibilities, to an extent which they themselves did not\r\nrealize.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe next went to Rome. All my life I had looked forward to visiting\r\n\"Imperial Rome\" on her seven hills, the old Rome that inspired some of\r\nthe leading chapters of the world's history. And my imagination was\r\nfired the more because in my mind's eye I carried for comparison a\r\npicture of Athens, city of Pallas Athene, once proud intellectual\r\nmistress of the world; Jerusalem, from whence emanated the spiritual\r\nendowment of civilization; and the new Rome to which Constantine brought\r\nthe scepter of the world.\r\n\r\nWhile in Rome we were entertained by our ambassador and Mrs. Draper.\r\nThey were occupying Palazzo Piombino, one of the most magnificent of the\r\nnewer palaces, where they entertained in a manner befitting their\r\nstation. We met there several of my former colleagues at Constantinople\r\nwho were now representing their governments in Rome. Moses Ezekiel, our\r\ndistinguished American sculptor, was also in Rome at this time, and with\r\nhim and Mr. Bonney, in charge of the excavations of the Forum then in\r\nprocess, we went through the recently excavated chambers of the vestal\r\nvirgins.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the city we were received by the beautiful and charming\r\nQueen Margherita. She was a remarkably well-informed woman, even about\r\nevents in our country. She spoke about the American press, and said one\r\nof our papers had a correspondent in Rome who was an ardent supporter of\r\npapal rule and could see no virtue in the Italian Government. She\r\nreferred to the invention of the flying machine by Professor Langley, of\r\nthe Smithsonian Institution, which, if it proved a success, would\r\nultimately change the life of all peoples, which she hoped would bring\r\nthe nations nearer to one another and into closer spiritual contact.\r\n\r\nWe visited Pompeii, and then went to Naples, where we boarded a steamer\r\nfor New York, arriving home on February 8, 1900.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nImmediately I went to Washington for a conference with Secretary Hay and\r\nto give him the details of the various negotiations. He was especially\r\ninterested in the communication of the Sultan to the Sulu Mohammedans,\r\nfor the friendly relations that this established between the Sulus and\r\nour Government had already prevented the shedding of blood.\r\n\r\nI told Secretary Hay that I desired to resign. The matters for which I\r\nhad been sent to Turkey were adjusted, the payment of the indemnity\r\nbeing only a question of time and patience; on the other hand, it was\r\nimportant, so far as concerned my personal affairs, that I be relieved\r\nfrom further duty abroad, especially as I could not in Turkey properly\r\ngive to my children the education I felt they should have. The secretary\r\nthought my request reasonable and just, but he thought the President\r\nwould regret it and would have difficulty in replacing me.\r\n\r\nI took the subject up with the President next day. He said he realized I\r\nhad made sacrifices enough and was entitled to have my wishes respected;\r\nhe did not, however, wish me to send in my resignation just yet, but to\r\ncontinue, for a time at least, to direct matters in Turkey in\r\nconsultation with Secretary Hay. He expressed great satisfaction with\r\nthe result of my mission and said if he hadn't sent me, some hostile\r\ndemonstration in Turkish waters would have been inevitable, with\r\npossible serious complications as a result; but that the clamoring for a\r\nwarship to Turkey subsided with my going over because of the general\r\nbelief that I would succeed in handling matters. \"No one else could have\r\ndone so well; you have done better than I thought it possible for any\r\none to do,\" he graciously added.\r\n\r\nHe indicated that there might develop some important post in the United\r\nStates which he should like to feel free to ask me to accept should the\r\noccasion arise, but he made no further explanation. I later learned from\r\nSt. Clair McKelway to what this had reference. McKelway was on intimate\r\nterms with the President and at the same time was a close friend of\r\nmine. The President mentioned to him that he feared Secretary Hay, whose\r\nhealth was failing, might have to relinquish his post, in which event\r\nMcKinley had in mind to offer it to me.\r\n\r\nWithin a week after my return I received a letter from Charles C.\r\nHarrison, provost of the University of Pennsylvania, informing me that\r\nthe trustees had unanimously voted to confer upon me the honorary degree\r\nof Doctor of Laws, and he would be glad if it were convenient for me to\r\nreceive the degree at a convocation of unusual importance on\r\nWashington's Birthday. This ceremony took place at the Academy of Music,\r\nPhiladelphia, and similar degrees were conferred also upon Justice\r\nHarlan, of the United States Supreme Court; Professor Ames, of the\r\nHarvard Law School; Minister Wu, of China; President Diaz, of Mexico;\r\nand two delegates from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time during the next few months I went to Washington both\r\nto direct Turkish matters through the State Department and to confer\r\nwith the President on matters in general. On one of these occasions, in\r\nAugust, he mentioned his forthcoming letter of acceptance of\r\nrenomination and spoke about the efforts of the Democrats to fasten the\r\ncharge of imperialism on the administration, but said he would make it\r\nplain that we proposed to give as much freedom of government and\r\nindependence to the Philippines as they showed themselves able to\r\nreceive. I read to him from a memorandum I had drawn up regarding our\r\npurpose to withdraw our troops as fast and in proportion as the\r\nconditions of peace in the islands permitted. He said I had expressed\r\nhis ideas exactly, and as I was about to replace the memorandum in my\r\npocket he said he wished I would let him have it, which of course I did.\r\n\r\nHe asked what I thought of conditions in China, and I told him I was\r\nconvinced our true course was to oppose the partition of that country\r\nand to stand firm for the open-door policy; that if Germany, or any\r\nother Power, endeavored to bring about a division, we could doubtless\r\nprevent it by insisting upon the open door, especially as the nations\r\ncould not agree among themselves.\r\n\r\nEarly in December I received a letter from Secretary Hay, asking whether\r\nI still preferred to be relieved or whether for any reason I would\r\nconsent to continue as minister to Turkey. I definitely answered in the\r\nnegative and my second mission terminated with the following letter:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                DEPARTMENT OF STATE\r\n                                        WASHINGTON, _December 18, 1900_\r\n\r\n     OSCAR S. STRAUS, ESQUIRE\r\n        42 Warren Street\r\n          New York City\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR MR. STRAUS:\r\n\r\n     I have laid before the President your letter of the 12th instant,\r\n     in which you express your preference not to return to\r\n     Constantinople, and offer your resignation of the mission you have\r\n     honorably and faithfully filled for the past few years.\r\n\r\n     Deferring to your wish, the President has accepted your\r\n     resignation. In charging me to inform you of this acceptance, the\r\n     President desires me to make known in fitting words his high\r\n     appreciation of the valuable services you have rendered to your\r\n     country, and his sense of the ability and intelligence you have\r\n     brought to bear in the performance of a task of more than usual\r\n     delicacy and difficulty. Called, as you were, a second time to the\r\n     Ottoman mission and confronted by the problems and entanglements\r\n     that seem to especially environ that post, you have shown rare\r\n     aptness in dealing with its perplexities and have notably\r\n     strengthened the hands of the government in leading the long\r\n     pending questions toward a settlement. While deeply regretting your\r\n     retirement and while averse to losing your helpful counsels, the\r\n     President has felt that he could not rightfully impose fresh\r\n     personal sacrifices upon you by disregarding your wish. You take\r\n     with you into honored private life the esteem of those who have\r\n     known and understood your conscientious worth in the paths of\r\n     official duty.\r\n\r\n     I share the President's regrets and equally share his appreciation\r\n     of the good services you have rendered. My sincere regards and\r\n     personal friendship are with you always.\r\n\r\n                          Very cordially yours\r\n                                           JOHN HAY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHEODORE ROOSEVELT\r\n\r\n     Roosevelt appoints me member of the Hague Tribunal--Trouble with\r\n     Philippine Mohammedans averted--Humanitarian diplomacy under\r\n     Roosevelt; Hay's Roumanian note; Roosevelt's Russian cable--The\r\n     Alaska boundary--Panama and the \"covenant running with the\r\n     land\"--White House luncheons; Carnegie suggests to Roosevelt a\r\n     legacy for my grandchildren--Roosevelt and organized\r\n     labor--Roosevelt's definition of Americanism--Overnight at the\r\n     White House; conference regarding the President's\r\n     Message--Roosevelt and the Portsmouth peace negotiations; Count\r\n     Witte invites a committee to discuss the Russian Jewish question;\r\n     Roosevelt writes to Witte--Roosevelt's prophetic characterization\r\n     of Germany--Some essential qualities of Roosevelt.\r\n\r\n\r\nI began the year 1901 as a private citizen once more. I devoted much of\r\nmy time, however, to public activities, giving close attention\r\nparticularly to the international questions that arose.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of citizenship and the rights of naturalized American\r\ncitizens in foreign countries had for many years formed the major\r\nsubject in our foreign relations, and it had been one for constant\r\ncontroversy between our own and foreign countries, especially Germany,\r\nAustria, and Turkey. In the spring I read a paper at a meeting of the\r\nAmerican Social Science Association, of which I was the president,\r\nentitled \"The United States Doctrine of Citizenship and Expatriation.\"\r\nLater in the year I received, in consequence, a letter from Senator S.\r\nM. Cullom of Illinois, chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign\r\nRelations, asking me to prepare material for amendments to legislation\r\non this subject, which I did.\r\n\r\nWhen Theodore Roosevelt became President of the United States through\r\nthe lamentable death of William McKinley, one of my earliest relations\r\nwith him was my being appointed by him as a member of the Permanent\r\nCourt of Arbitration at The Hague. Whether or not he acted herein in\r\nconformity with McKinley's intention, I cannot say. When McKinley was\r\nselecting the original members, he conferred with me and indicated that\r\nif agreeable to me, he would be pleased to appoint me as a member.\r\nShortly afterward when the appointments were announced, my name was not\r\namong them. It was some time before I saw him again, and while I should\r\nnever have mentioned it, he did. He said he was very sorry that through\r\nthe pressure of duties he had quite forgotten his intention to name me\r\nwhen the time came to announce the appointments. I told him I thought\r\nperhaps I had been mistaken in understanding that he had offered me one\r\nof the appointments. He said I had not misunderstood, but that he would\r\nmake amends should a vacancy occur while he was still President; he had\r\nwanted me as a member of the Court, not alone in recognition of the\r\ngreat services I had rendered, but because he regarded me exceptionally\r\nqualified. He added that when he became ex-President he would like to be\r\na member of that Court himself; it appealed to him more than any other\r\noffice he could think of.\r\n\r\nThe vacancy in the membership of the Court occurred sooner than any one\r\nanticipated, by the death, in March, 1901, of ex-President Harrison; but\r\nby the decree of the gods McKinley himself was no longer with us when\r\nthe time came to fill President Harrison's place. In fact I think the\r\nday we talked about the Court marked my last conference with him. He was\r\nalways simple in manner and of charming personality. Together we enjoyed\r\na good smoke that afternoon; he was fond of smoking and knew I enjoyed a\r\ngood cigar, and he was wont to have me take one of his brand. I begged\r\nhim not to concern himself further with the omission of my appointment\r\nat The Hague, that I was satisfied to know he thought me worthy of the\r\nselection.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that Roosevelt knew the circumstance and McKinley's\r\nintention, for he was Vice-President at the time it happened. At any\r\nrate, when the successor to President Harrison was chosen, I received\r\nthe following appointment, somewhat different in form from most\r\ndocuments of the kind:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     WHITE HOUSE\r\n                                           WASHINGTON, _January 8, 1902_\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR SIR:\r\n\r\n     Article XX of the Convention for the Pacific Settlement of\r\n     International Disputes, signed July 29, 1899, by the\r\n     Plenipotentiaries to the Hague Peace Conference, provides for the\r\n     organization of a permanent Court of Arbitration, and Article XXIII\r\n     of the same Convention provides for the selection by each of the\r\n     signatory Powers of four persons at the most, as members of the\r\n     Court, who are to be appointed for a term of six years.\r\n\r\n     It will give me pleasure to designate you as one of the four United\r\n     States members if you will advise me that such action is agreeable\r\n     to you.\r\n\r\n                                Very Truly Yours,\r\n                                          THEODORE ROOSEVELT\r\n\r\n     HONORABLE OSCAR S. STRAUS\r\n         New York, N.Y.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince then I have been reappointed three times: in 1908, again by\r\nRoosevelt, in 1912 and 1920, by Wilson.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1902, there appeared in the press a dispatch to the effect\r\nthat an expedition of twelve hundred men was to be sent to the southern\r\nPhilippines to punish the Mohammedans there for killing one of our\r\nsoldiers and wounding several others. I immediately wrote the President\r\nthat I believed such a step would be unwise and would probably bring on\r\na general uprising in that province. I called his attention to the\r\nnegotiation I had had with the Sultan of Turkey regarding these people,\r\nand suggested that instead of the expedition a commission be sent to\r\ntreat with them. The President asked me to come to Washington to confer\r\nwith him in the matter, and after the Cabinet meeting I met him in his\r\nstudy. There were present also Mr. Taft, who had been appointed governor\r\nof the Philippines, Adjutant-General Corbin, and Mr. Sanger, acting\r\nSecretary of War. I presented my arguments more fully. The President had\r\nalready telegraphed General Chaffee regarding the sending of a\r\ndiplomatic mission, in accordance with my letter.\r\n\r\nThe result of our conference was that General Corbin was directed to\r\nadvise General Chaffee to use the office of the friendly datos to obtain\r\nthe desired redress. It developed later that the soldier killed was\r\nlaying a telegraph line, which procedure, not being understood by the\r\nMoros, was regarded by them as a device for their destruction. The\r\nslayers were surrendered and punished and the incident was\r\nsatisfactorily adjusted.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt about this time disturbances in Roumania were being reflected in our\r\ncountry. Eleven years before, a committee of prominent Jews had brought\r\nbefore President Harrison the pitiable condition of the large number of\r\nJews arriving in New York from Russia, and it was now necessary to take\r\nsimilar steps with regard to the Jews from Roumania.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter IV I mentioned that Roumania disregarded the provisions of\r\nthe Treaty of Berlin and placed restrictions upon her Jewish subjects.\r\nInto that treaty, by which Roumania was made an independent kingdom\r\nfollowing the Russo-Turkish War, Article XLIV was inserted specially for\r\nthe protection of the Jews, of whom there were about four hundred\r\nthousand in the new state. It provided that difference of religion\r\nshould not be ground for exclusion in the participation of civil,\r\npolitical, or economic rights. In spite of this, however, the Jews in\r\nRoumania were being oppressed and discriminated against on the specious\r\nclaim that they were foreigners, though they and their ancestors had\r\nbeen living in the land for generations. They were compelled to serve in\r\nthe army, but not permitted to become officers; they were made subject\r\nto exceptional taxes; they were excluded from the professions and from\r\nowning and cultivating land. In every direction they were being\r\nthrottled, and new laws were being promulgated to shut off every avenue\r\nof self-support.\r\n\r\nThe result was what had doubtless been the intention in putting into\r\nforce these drastic measures: the Jews who could emigrated, and they\r\nleft Roumania _en masse_. The obstacles in the way of their gaining\r\nadmission into the countries of Western Europe were so great that few of\r\nthem could settle there. The leading Jewish organizations of Great\r\nBritain and France, namely, the Jewish Colonization Association in\r\nLondon and the Alliance Israelite Universelle in Paris, laid the matter\r\nbefore their respective governments, but, on account of the disturbed\r\nconditions in the Balkans and the cross-currents of European politics,\r\nno pressure could be exerted through these governments.\r\n\r\nThe main stream of the Roumanian exodus was thus directed to America,\r\nand they arrived here in increasing numbers. The leading Jewish agencies\r\nof the country, particularly the B'nai B'rith Order under the presidency\r\nof Leo N. Levi, used their best efforts to distribute the immigrants\r\nover the country and to places where they were most likely to find\r\nemployment. Later our very able commissioner of immigration at Ellis\r\nIsland, Robert Watchorn, went over to Roumania for the special purpose\r\nof studying the situation and made a graphic report of what he learned.\r\nBut to alleviate the situation action of a more official character was\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\nJacob H. Schiff and I prepared a careful brief on conditions and\r\npresented it to President Roosevelt. The President said he was willing\r\nto take the matter in hand provided something could be done by our\r\nGovernment. Congressman Lucius N. Littauer also extended helpful\r\ncooperation. He had recently returned from Roumania and had first-hand\r\nknowledge of the question, which he took up in conferences with the\r\nPresident and with Secretary Hay.\r\n\r\nFinally, in September, 1902, the President directed Secretary Hay to\r\nprepare his now famous Roumanian Note to the Powers signatory to the\r\nTreaty of Berlin. The note was sent to our diplomatic representatives in\r\nthose countries with instructions to present it to the governments to\r\nwhich they were accredited. The occasion for sending it was found in\r\nconnection with negotiations initiated by Roumania for the concluding of\r\na naturalization treaty with our country. The note gave the reasons why,\r\nunder the circumstances, we were unwilling to conclude such a treaty.\r\nAfter referring to the Treaty of Berlin and the obligations assumed by\r\nRoumania under it regarding the treatment of subject nationalities, the\r\nSecretary said:\r\n\r\n     The United States offers asylum to the oppressed of all lands. But\r\n     its sympathy with them in no wise impairs its just liberty and\r\n     right to weigh the acts of the oppressor in the light of their\r\n     effects upon this country, and to judge accordingly.\r\n\r\n     Putting together the facts, now painfully brought home to this\r\n     Government, during the past few years, that many of the\r\n     inhabitants of Roumania are being forced by artificially adverse\r\n     discriminations to quit their native country; that the hospitable\r\n     asylum offered by this country is almost the only refuge left to\r\n     them; that they come hither unfitted by the conditions of their\r\n     exile to take part in the new life of this land under circumstances\r\n     either profitable to themselves or beneficial to the community, and\r\n     that they are objects of charity from the outset and for a long\r\n     time--the right of remonstrance against the acts of the Roumanian\r\n     Government is clearly established in favor of this Government.\r\n     Whether consciously and of purpose or not, these helpless people,\r\n     burdened and spurned by their native land, are forced by the\r\n     sovereign power of Roumania upon the charity of the United States.\r\n     This Government can not be a tacit party to such an international\r\n     wrong. It is constrained to protest against the treatment to which\r\n     the Jews of Roumania are subjected, not alone because it has\r\n     unimpeachable ground to remonstrate against the resultant injury to\r\n     itself, but in the name of humanity. The United States may not\r\n     authoritatively appeal to the stipulations of the treaty of Berlin,\r\n     to which it was not and can not become a signatory, but it does\r\n     earnestly appeal to the principles consigned therein, because they\r\n     are the principles of international law and eternal justice,\r\n     advocating the broad toleration which that solemn compact enjoins\r\n     and standing ready to lend its moral support to the fulfillment\r\n     thereof by its cosignatories, for the act of Roumania itself has\r\n     effectively joined the United States to them as an interested party\r\n     in this regard.\r\n\r\nOne of the most valuable by-products of the Congress of Berlin was to\r\nbring into closer relations the autocratic with the liberal governments\r\nof Europe and cause the former to become more amenable to the\r\nenlightened conscience of the world. Hay's dispatch, while not pleasing\r\nto the Government of Roumania, yet, because of the world-wide publicity\r\nit received, had a measure of influence in modifying Roumania's\r\nindefensible proscriptions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother need for humanitarian diplomacy arose the following year. The\r\nattitude and proscriptions of the Roumanian authorities had doubtless\r\nencouraged anti-Semitic activity in Russia, and the latter Government,\r\nno longer contenting itself with the application of restrictions in the\r\nbook of laws which compelled Jews to live in the Pale settlements,\r\nofficially encouraged mobs to massacre and loot, culminating on April\r\n19-20, 1903, with the outbreak in Kishineff, where forty-seven Jews were\r\nkilled, ninety-two severely wounded, and some five hundred more slightly\r\ninjured. In addition great material losses were inflicted: seven hundred\r\nhouses were destroyed, six hundred stores pillaged, and thousands of\r\nfamilies utterly ruined.\r\n\r\nWhen these facts became known, they called forth an expression of\r\nindignation throughout the civilized world. In New York a mass meeting\r\nwas called at Carnegie Hall by hundreds of the foremost New York\r\nChristians, in protest against the outrages upon the Jews in Russia and\r\nparticularly against the Kishineff affair. The meeting was presided over\r\nby Paul D. Cravath, eminent lawyer, and the speakers were ex-President\r\nCleveland, Mayor Seth Low, Jacob G. Schurman, president of Cornell, and\r\nEdward M. Shepard, well known for his unselfish devotion to the\r\ninterests of the public. I have in my possession the manuscript of\r\nCleveland's address on this occasion, which concludes:\r\n\r\n     In the meantime, let the people of the United States, gathered\r\n     together in such assemblages as this in every part of the land,\r\n     fearlessly speak to the civilized world--protesting against every\r\n     pretence of civilization that permits mediaeval persecution, against\r\n     every bigoted creed that forbids religious toleration and freedom\r\n     of conscience, against all false enlightenment that excuses hatred\r\n     and cruelty towards any race of men, and against all spurious forms\r\n     of government protection, that withhold from any human being the\r\n     right to live in safety, and toil in peace.\r\n\r\n\r\nI will also quote part of the resolutions adopted that evening:\r\n\r\n     Resolved, that the people of the United States should exercise such\r\n     influence with the Government of Russia as the ancient and unbroken\r\n     friendship between the two nations may justify to stay the spirit\r\n     of persecution, to redress the injuries inflicted upon the Jews of\r\n     Kishineff, and to prevent the recurrence of outbreaks such as have\r\n     amazed the civilized world.\r\n\r\nA few weeks later a committee from the B'nai B'rith Order, consisting of\r\nSimon Wolf, Adolf Moses, Julius Bien, Jacob Furth, Solomon Sulzberger,\r\nand Joseph D. Coons, and headed by their president, Leo N. Levi, called\r\nupon Secretary Hay and presented to him a statement regarding the\r\nmassacres in Russia together with a proposed petition which they wished\r\nforwarded to the Government of the Czar. The Secretary expressed great\r\nsympathy and the desire to do what might be possible in the matter. His\r\nreply to the committee, taken down in shorthand at the time, was\r\npublished in full in the press, and from it I quote the concluding\r\nsentence:\r\n\r\n     All we know of the state of things in Russia tends to justify the\r\n     hope that even out of the present terrible situation some good\r\n     results may come; that He who watches over Israel does not slumber,\r\n     and that the wrath of man now, as so often in the past, shall be\r\n     made to praise Him.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary then accompanied the committee to the White House, where\r\nthey met the President and presented to him an outline of the oppression\r\nof their co-religionists in Russia.\r\n\r\nEarly in July I received a telegram from the President's secretary to\r\nthe effect that the President would like to have me lunch with him the\r\nday following at Oyster Bay, and that Simon Wolf of Washington, and Leo\r\nN. Levi also had been invited. When I arrived at Sagamore Hill there\r\nwere present besides those named Dr. Albert Shaw of the \"Review of\r\nReviews,\" and an English friend of his, Mr. Morris Sheldon Amos.\r\n\r\nWe discussed the Russian situation throughout lunch. The President\r\nsuggested that a note be sent by the Secretary of State to John W.\r\nRiddle, our charge at St. Petersburg, and that this note should embody\r\nthe entire petition which Mr. Levi and his committee had drafted. Dr.\r\nShaw observed that the embodying of the petition to the Czar and giving\r\npublicity to the note would have all the effects of a presentation even\r\nif the Czar should refuse to receive it, which was exactly what the\r\nPresident had in mind.\r\n\r\nAfter luncheon we adjourned to the study, and Roosevelt said: \"Now let's\r\nfinish this thing up.\" Hay had been to see him the day before and had\r\nleft a memorandum. Roosevelt at once drafted the note with his own pen,\r\nusing part of Hay's memorandum. The note was to be sent as an open\r\ncable. It read as follows:\r\n\r\n     RIDDLE\r\n\r\n     St. Petersburg\r\n\r\n     You are instructed to ask an audience of the Minister of Foreign\r\n     Affairs and to make to him the following communication:\r\n\r\n     _Excellency_: The Secretary of State instructs me to inform you\r\n     that the President has received from a large number of prominent\r\n     citizens of the United States of all religious affiliations, and\r\n     occupying the highest positions in both public and private life, a\r\n     respectful petition addressed to his Majesty the Emperor relating\r\n     to the condition of the Jews in Russia and running as follows:\r\n\r\n     [Here is set out the petition.]\r\n\r\n     I am instructed to ask whether the petition will be received by\r\n     your Excellency to be submitted to the gracious consideration of\r\n     his Majesty. In that case the petition will be at once forwarded to\r\n     St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\nRoosevelt wanted the cable to be sent at once and was in a hurry to get\r\nit to Washington. One of his reasons was that the late Russian\r\nambassador, Cassini, had been dismissed and was on his way back to\r\nRussia, and he wanted the note to reach the Russian Government before\r\nCassini arrived in St. Petersburg. Mr. Wolf, who lived in Washington,\r\nwas to take the drafted cable to Secretary Hay; but as he could not\r\nreturn that night the President asked whether I could take it so that it\r\nmight be dispatched next morning. By ten o'clock the following morning I\r\nplaced the draft in the Secretary's hands and it was immediately put on\r\nthe wire.\r\n\r\nIn planning the cable as he did, the President was right in his\r\nanticipation. Duly the American charge at St. Petersburg informed the\r\nState Department that the Russian Government, through its Minister of\r\nForeign Affairs, had declined to receive or consider the petition.\r\nNevertheless, its purpose was accomplished. Official Russia was made to\r\nrealize the aroused indignation and the public protests of the civilized\r\nworld. This in turn had a decided influence in checking, for the time\r\nbeing at least, similar outbreaks threatened throughout the empire,\r\nbesides bringing to trial and punishment some of the leaders of the\r\nmassacres.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat afternoon at Sagamore Hill, after the Russian matter had been\r\ndisposed of, the President was talking to Dr. Shaw and me about the\r\nAlaskan boundary question. He pulled out a map showing the disputed\r\nboundary, and explained that three commissioners from the United States\r\nand three from Great Britain and Canada would take up the dispute for\r\ninvestigation. He argued that they were not arbiters and he refused to\r\nsign an arbitral agreement; if they did not agree, he would take the\r\nmatter into his own hands; that the whole trouble arose from the fact\r\nthat the Canadians had shoved down the boundary line after the discovery\r\nof gold. \"Suppose a man pitches a tent on my grounds and claims them,\r\nand I want him to get off; and he says he won't get off, but will\r\narbitrate the matter!\" Roosevelt exclaimed. Then, turning to me, he\r\nadded: \"Straus, you are a member of the Hague Tribunal; don't you think\r\nI'm right?\"\r\n\r\nI calmly replied that as a member of the Hague Tribunal I should first\r\nhave to hear what the other side had to say and therefore must reserve\r\nmy judgment. And we all had a good laugh.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring the Venezuela controversy in 1902, Venezuela on the one side and\r\nGreat Britain and Germany on the other, Roosevelt was very much incensed\r\nthat Germany, with the feeble backing of England, should undertake a\r\nblockade against Venezuela to make the latter carry out certain\r\nagreements, and he promptly took steps to prevent it. Thereupon there\r\nwas a disposition on the part of Germany to ask Roosevelt to arbitrate.\r\nSecretary Hay, it seems, favored such a course, but I strongly advised\r\nagainst it.\r\n\r\nAt a luncheon to which I was invited by the President early in November,\r\n1903, the conditions in Panama came up as the principal topic of\r\nconversation. There were present on this occasion, besides Mr. and Mrs.\r\nRoosevelt, Cornelius N. Bliss, former Secretary of the Interior; John\r\nClark Davis, of the \"Philadelphia Ledger\"; H. H. Kohlsaat, of Chicago;\r\nLawrence F. Abbott, of \"The Outlook\"; and the President's\r\nbrother-in-law, Lieutenant-Commander Cowles, of the Navy. News had been\r\nreceived that Panama had separated from Colombia and we were about to\r\nrecognize Panama. In his informal way, as was his custom at luncheons,\r\nthe President began to discuss the situation, referring to the fact that\r\nour treaty of 1846 was with New Granada, which afterwards became the\r\nUnited States of Colombia and then the Republic of Colombia, and that in\r\nthat treaty we had guaranteed to protect the transit route. One of the\r\nquestions raised was whether the treaty still held us to that\r\nobligation, notwithstanding these several changes of sovereignty.\r\n\r\nThe President was directing his remarks toward me, which was his way of\r\nsignifying the particular person from whom he wanted to draw comment. I\r\nanswered that it seemed to me, as I recollected the terms of the treaty,\r\nwhich I had recently read, that the change of sovereignty did not affect\r\neither our obligations or our rights; that I regarded them in the nature\r\nof a \"covenant running with the land.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's fine! Just the idea!\" Roosevelt replied, and as soon as luncheon\r\nwas over, he requested me to express that idea to Hay. He scratched a\r\nfew lines on a correspondence card asking Secretary Hay to go over with\r\nme the suggestion I had made and to work into the treaty the \"covenant\r\nrunning with the land\" idea.\r\n\r\nThat evening I called on the Secretary. He seized the idea at once and\r\nsaid he would make use of it in a statement he was just preparing for\r\nthe press detailing the whole situation. The following day there was\r\nreported in the papers of the country the fact that the President,\r\nfollowing a meeting of the Cabinet, had decided to recognize the _de\r\nfacto_ government of Panama; and then the detailed statement by\r\nSecretary Hay regarding the terms of the treaty, the history of the\r\nnegotiations, and the subsequent development, covered several newspaper\r\ncolumns. It contained this paragraph:\r\n\r\n     It must not be lost sight of that this treaty is not dependent for\r\n     its efficacy on the personnel of the signers or the name of the\r\n     territory it affects. It is a covenant, as lawyers say, that runs\r\n     with the land. The name of New Granada has passed away; its\r\n     territory has been divided. But as long as the isthmus endures, the\r\n     great geographical fact keeps alive the solemn compact which binds\r\n     the holders of the territory to grant us freedom of transit, and\r\n     binds us in return to safeguard for the isthmus and the world the\r\n     exercise of that inestimable privilege.\r\n\r\nA few days thereafter I received a short note from the President\r\nreading: \"Your 'covenant running with the land' idea worked admirably. I\r\ncongratulate you on it.\" And from my friend John Bassett Moore I\r\nreceived an amusing letter:\r\n\r\n     So you had a finger in the pie! I find a good deal of amusement in\r\n     reflecting on the end reached from the premise of my memorandum;\r\n     and almost as much on the conclusion reached from your suggestion.\r\n     Perhaps, however, it is only a question of words--that is to say,\r\n     it is, indifferently, a question of the \"covenant running with the\r\n     land\" or a question of the \"covenant running (_away!_) with the\r\n     land\"!!\r\n\r\nThose luncheons at the White House were always pleasant and interesting\r\noccasions. One met there all kinds of people, of every station in life,\r\nbut always people who stood for something and who interested the\r\nPresident. At the table Roosevelt would speak without apparent reserve\r\nand free from all official restraint, and I doubt whether these\r\nconfidences were ever abused. By this means, too, he received the frank,\r\nunreserved statements and criticisms of his guests.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of the range of personalities one would meet at the\r\nRoosevelt luncheons, I remember one day when Seth Bullock, a former\r\nsheriff of the Black Hills district and an intimate friend of Roosevelt\r\nduring his cowboy days, sat next to Seth Low at the table. And in his\r\n\"Autobiography\" Roosevelt himself says:\r\n\r\n     No guests were ever more welcome at the White House than these old\r\n     friends of the cattle ranches and the cow camps--the men with whom\r\n     I had ridden the long circle and eaten at the tail-board of a\r\n     chuck-wagon--whenever they turned up at Washington during my\r\n     Presidency. I remember one of them who appeared at Washington one\r\n     day just before lunch, a huge, powerful man who, when I knew him,\r\n     had been distinctly a fighting character. It happened that on that\r\n     day another old friend, the British Ambassador, Mr. Bryce, was\r\n     among those coming to lunch. Just before we went in I turned to my\r\n     cow-puncher friend and said to him with great solemnity, \"Remember,\r\n     Jim, that if you shot at the feet of the British Ambassador to make\r\n     him dance, it would be likely to cause international\r\n     complications\"; to which Jim responded, with unaffected horror,\r\n     \"Why, Colonel, I shouldn't think of it, I shouldn't think of it!\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Roosevelt is a most charming and cultured woman, typically the wife\r\nand mother. Literary and intellectual matters appeal to her, though her\r\ndominant note is the domestic one. I am sure she would have been just as\r\nhappy as the mistress of a private household as the leading lady of the\r\nland in the White House, despite her great tact, sweetness, and simple\r\ndignity in filling the latter position.\r\n\r\nThe President was an omnivorous reader. He could read faster and\r\nremember better than any one I have ever known. On one occasion he\r\nrecommended to me Ferrero's \"Greatness and Decline of Rome,\" which he\r\nhad just finished in the original Italian, and which had been brought\r\nout in English by the Putnam house. Subsequently, too, I met this author\r\nat the White House, where he and his wife were the guests of the\r\nPresident for several days.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1904, a large conference was held in Washington of\r\nrepresentatives of the various peace societies and other persons\r\nprominently interested in the calling of an international peace\r\ncongress. George F. Seward, of New York, was chairman, and others\r\nconnected with it were the Reverend Edward Everett Hale and Robert Treat\r\nPaine, of Boston; Henry St. George Tucker, of Virginia, Andrew Carnegie,\r\nand myself. Resolutions were adopted recommending the negotiation of a\r\ntreaty with Great Britain whereby all differences between us which might\r\nfail of adjustment through diplomatic channels were to be submitted for\r\narbitration to the Permanent Court at The Hague. It was further\r\nrecommended that we enter into like treaties with other powers as soon\r\nas practicable. We called on the President and the resolutions were\r\npresented by Mr. Tucker; Mr. Carnegie and I each made a few remarks,\r\nwhich the President in turn answered with a brief address. When he had\r\nfinished and we were all standing around him, Mr. Carnegie said to him,\r\n\"I have just been congratulating Mr. Straus on the compliments you paid\r\nhim, and suggested that he get a copy of that portion of your remarks to\r\npreserve for his children and grandchildren.\" Roosevelt immediately\r\nturned to Mr. Loeb, his secretary, and instructed him to send to me that\r\nportion of his remarks, adding: \"And I meant every word I said.\" I trust\r\nI may be pardoned for the egotism which prompts me to incorporate it in\r\nthese memoirs:\r\n\r\n     I have had from Mr. Straus aid that I can not over-estimate, for\r\n     which I can not too much express my gratitude, in so much of the\r\n     diplomatic work that has arisen in this administration--aid by\r\n     suggestion, aid by actual work in helping me to carry out the\r\n     suggestions; and Mr. Straus was one of the two or three men who\r\n     first set my mind, after I came in as President, in the direction\r\n     of doing everything that could be done for the Hague Tribunal, as\r\n     that seemed to be the best way to turn for arbitration.\r\n\r\nAt another pleasant luncheon there was present Alice, now the wife of\r\nCongressman Longworth, of Ohio, Roosevelt's daughter by his first wife.\r\nIn the course of our discussion about the reciprocity treaty with Cuba\r\nand the making of more favorable tariff arrangements, I said: \"We went\r\nto war with Spain for the liberation of Cuba, and now if we treat her\r\nstep-motherly and starve her to death, what would the world say?\" There\r\nwas hearty laughter all round the table, and Miss Alice turned to me and\r\nsaid, in her naive way and with a mischievous sparkle in her eyes: \"Do I\r\nlook starved?\" The President had fairly exploded with laughter, and when\r\nI remarked that I had \"put my foot into it,\" he added, amid another\r\noutburst, \"Yes, both of them!\"\r\n\r\nThe President did not smoke, but always served cigars and cigarettes to\r\nhis guests. When I did not take one, he said, \"Straus, you smoke.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I answered, \"but I certainly want to pay as much respect to you\r\nas I always did to the Sultan of Turkey. He did not drink, and I never\r\ntook any when it was served.\"\r\n\r\n\"You go right ahead and smoke. If Root were here he would smoke and\r\nalways does,\" replied Roosevelt.\r\n\r\nAfter lunch that day, when the other guests had gone, he and I went into\r\nan adjoining room and had a general discussion--labor matters, the\r\nNational Civic Federation, the Republican Party, etc., etc. He said he\r\nhad received a number of requests to put into the Republican platform a\r\nplank protesting against the discrimination made by Russia against\r\nAmericans of the Jewish faith. \"You know,\" he said, \"I am prepared to do\r\nanything that I can for all of our citizens regardless of race or\r\ncreed, but unless we mean to do something further than simply protest it\r\nwould look like an effort to catch votes, for such statements in the\r\nplatform could not be regarded for any other purpose.\" He added he had\r\nin mind a different and more effective way of handling the subject when\r\nthe time came. He said he remembered that I had never asked him to take\r\naction in this or any other question that was not justified on broad\r\nAmerican principles, but that if anything arose which specially\r\nreflected upon the Jews he looked to me to bring it to his attention,\r\nand I was to regard that just as much my duty as the protection of\r\nAmerican Christian interests in Turkey.\r\n\r\nWe spoke about the Russo-Japanese War, and I told him that some one had\r\nsaid that the Japs were yellow-skinned, but the Russians were yellow all\r\nthe way through. This called forth a hearty laugh. Humor of any kind,\r\nprovided it was clean, he always appreciated, and his own sense of it\r\ncontinually served, as it did for Lincoln, to lighten the seriousness of\r\nhis duties.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLike Lincoln, too, Roosevelt combined with that balancing sense of humor\r\nan innate and always active sense of justice. Time and again in my\r\nrelationship with him I have observed and admired it. I recall in this\r\nregard the case of an employee named Miller in the Government Printing\r\nOffice, who was discharged because he did not belong to the union, and\r\nRoosevelt reinstated him. Mr. Gompers and several members of the\r\nExecutive Committee of the American Federation of Labor thereupon called\r\nupon the President to protest against this reinstatement. They said his\r\ndischarge was based on two points: that he was a non-union man, and also\r\nthat he was an incapable worker. Roosevelt's answer was: \"The question\r\nof his personal fitness is one to be settled in the routine of\r\nadministrative detail, and cannot be allowed to conflict with or to\r\ncomplicate the larger question of governmental discrimination for or\r\nagainst him or any other man because he is or is not a member of a\r\nunion. This is the only question now before me for decision; and as to\r\nthis my decision is final.\"\r\n\r\nAs I was in constant touch with the President by correspondence and\r\nconferences, I wrote him telling of my gratification to find in his\r\ndecision anent the Miller case such consonance in principle with his\r\nposition regarding the anthracite coal strike, to which I received the\r\nfollowing reply that brings out the point I have just made about his\r\nsense of justice:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                             WHITE HOUSE, WASHINGTON\r\n                                                _October 1, 1903_\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR MR. STRAUS:\r\n\r\n     I thank you heartily for your letter. When you can get on here I\r\n     should like to tell you for your own information some of my\r\n     experiences in connection with this Miller case. I feel exactly as\r\n     you do--that my action was a complement to my action, for instance,\r\n     in the anthracite coal strike, and that I could no more hesitate in\r\n     the teeth of opposition from the labor unions in one case, than I\r\n     could when the opposition came from the big monied men in the other\r\n     case.\r\n\r\n                                        Sincerely yours\r\n                                                     THEODORE ROOSEVELT\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps no President has had a policy, with regard to labor, so wise and\r\nfar-seeing as that of Roosevelt. Invariably he sought the counsel of\r\nlabor leaders in matters affecting their interests, and always they were\r\nmade to feel that redress for their just grievances, and their rights\r\ngenerally, were as much a concern of his and of his administration as\r\nany rights of the rich. In this connection I recall a remark of P. H.\r\nMorrissey, then head of the railroad train-men. We were seated in the\r\nRed Room of the White House for conference after dinner. There were\r\npresent some thirty or more men prominently identified with labor, whom\r\nthe President had invited to discuss labor legislation. Morrissey\r\nrecalled one time several years before when he sat in front of the great\r\nfireplace in the Red Room waiting for the President; and he said he\r\ncould not help reflecting what a long way it was from the cab of the\r\nlocomotive engine to this stately room in the official residence of the\r\nPresident of the United States, an honor and a privilege that Roosevelt\r\nwas the first President to give to men of labor.\r\n\r\nOn the same evening I saw in clear relief Roosevelt's wonderful tact,\r\njudgment, and understanding of men as I had never seen it displayed\r\nbefore. One or two of the labor leaders showed some bitterness in their\r\ncriticism of certain legislation. Roosevelt showed frank approval of\r\njust complaints and allayed irritation in a most tactful way where the\r\ndemand was unjust or unreasonable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the election of 1904 I took an active part and kept in close touch\r\nwith Roosevelt. An unusual amount of bitterness characterized this\r\ncampaign, though it was foreseen that Roosevelt would win by a large\r\nmajority. In this connection I received a characteristic letter from\r\nhim, dated at the White House October 15th:\r\n\r\n     I notice that various Democratic papers, including the Evening\r\n     Post, have endeavored to show that I have appealed to the Jew vote,\r\n     the Catholic vote, etc. Now the fact is that I have not appealed to\r\n     any man as Jew, as Protestant, or as Catholic, but that I have as\r\n     strongly as in me lies endeavored to make it evident that each is\r\n     to have a square deal, no more and no less, without regard to his\r\n     creed. I hope that this country will continue in substantially its\r\n     present form of government for many centuries. If this is so it is\r\n     reasonable to suppose that during that time there will be\r\n     Presidents of Jewish faith, Presidents of Catholic faith. Now, my\r\n     aim as President is to behave toward the Jew and the Catholic just\r\n     as I should wish a Jewish or Catholic President to behave towards\r\n     Protestants--in other words, to behave as a good American should\r\n     behave toward all his fellow Americans, without regard to the\r\n     several creeds they profess or the several lands from which their\r\n     ancestors have sprung. Moreover, I am pleased at what Lebowich says\r\n     at my not having a spirit of condescension or patronizing. I have\r\n     enough of the old Adam in me to object almost as strongly to being\r\n     patronized as to being wronged; and I do not intend knowingly to\r\n     behave toward others in a manner which I should resent if it were\r\n     adopted toward me.\r\n\r\nThese sentences bring to mind another and public statement of\r\nRoosevelt's in which he characterized Americanism; the occasion was an\r\naddress at the unveiling of the Sheridan equestrian statue in\r\nWashington:\r\n\r\n     We should keep steadily before our minds the fact that Americanism\r\n     is a question of principle, of purpose, of idealism, of character;\r\n     that it is not a matter of birthplace, or creed, or line of\r\n     descent.\r\n\r\n     Here in this country the representatives of many old-world races\r\n     are being fused together into a new type, a type the main features\r\n     of which are already determined, and were determined at the time of\r\n     the Revolutionary War; for the crucible in which all the new types\r\n     are melted into one was shaped from 1776 to 1789, and our\r\n     nationality was definitely fixed in all its essentials by the men\r\n     of Washington's day.\r\n\r\nSoon after the election he invited me to come to the White House for\r\ndinner one evening and to spend the night; there were a number of things\r\nhe wanted to talk over with me. When I arrived I found Dr. Lyman Abbott\r\nand his son Ernest had been similarly invited, and there were additional\r\nguests for dinner: Attorney-General Moody, Senator Knox, Secretary of\r\nWar Taft, and James R. Garfield, chief of the Bureau of Corporations in\r\nthe Department of Commerce and Labor.\r\n\r\nAt dinner the President announced that we had come together to do some\r\nbusiness, and he produced from his pocket a slip of paper on which were\r\nnoted the several subjects he wished to consider with us, mainly things\r\nto be incorporated in his forthcoming Message to Congress. First there\r\nwas the negro question. The South had vilified him because he\r\nentertained Booker Washington and appointed Crum Collector of the Port\r\nat Charleston. When Congress assembled, one of the things he intended\r\ndoing was to send in again the name of Crum for confirmation. \"The\r\nSoutherners either do not or do not wish to understand it,\" he said;\r\nadding that his position plainly was that he would do everything in his\r\npower for the white man South without, however, doing a wrong or an\r\ninjustice to the colored man. He was sympathetic with the South, for he\r\nwas half Southerner himself, his mother having come from Roswell,\r\nGeorgia. His remarks on this topic were directed mainly to Dr. Abbott.\r\n\r\nThe conversation then turned to the recent election and became very\r\ngeneral, every one joining and relating instances or experiences in\r\nconnection with it. Mr. Taft, who had waged a vigorous campaign for the\r\nAdministration, told a joke on himself: he had received a letter from\r\nWayne MacVeagh saying that so far as he (MacVeagh) could see, Taft's\r\nspeeches did not do any harm.\r\n\r\nWhen the talk had gone along these general lines for a while, Roosevelt\r\ninterjected with \"Now we must get back to business,\" and proceeded to\r\ndiscuss the diplomatic service in relation to his Message. He thought\r\ncivil service too strictly applied would be detrimental, as we had a\r\ngreat deal of old timber there that should be gotten rid of.\r\n\r\nNext he took up a discussion of Panama. Mr. Taft with several others was\r\nto leave next day on a mission there to look into the difficulties\r\nbetween the native army and the President of Panama, and some one\r\nhumorously suggested that he had better go down and take away the\r\nweapons from the army and let them muster as much as they wanted to\r\nwithout weapons.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner we adjourned to the President's study on the floor above.\r\nHe sat down at his desk and pulled open a drawer as he said: \"I want to\r\nread to you incomplete drafts of portions of my Message which I should\r\nlike to have you criticize, as on some of the subjects I have not yet\r\nfully made up my mind.\" The Message was in separate parts, each dealing\r\nwith an important subject. He took up the part dealing with our foreign\r\nrelations, in regard to Russia and Roumania, and addressed me, saying he\r\nwould like me to pay special attention to that as he had consulted me\r\nall along concerning the action to be taken. He said our Government had\r\nbeen criticized as interfering with the internal affairs of other\r\nnations, and the statement had been repeatedly made that we should not\r\nlike it if other nations took us to task for our negro lynchings in the\r\nSouth; but he argued that the lynchings were comparatively few, and,\r\nthough bad enough, were nothing compared to the wholesale murder in cold\r\nblood under official sanction and perhaps instigation, as in Kishineff.\r\n\"My answer to all these criticisms is this,\" he said; \"only a short time\r\nago I received a remonstrance or petition from a society in Great\r\nBritain regarding the lynchings in this country. I did not reject it; on\r\nthe contrary, I answered it most politely and expressed my great regret\r\nfor these unlawful, unjustifiable acts, with which neither I nor the\r\nGovernment had any sympathy. On the contrary the Government does\r\neverything in its power to prevent these outrages and unlawful acts.\r\nAnd I authorize any one to make use of this information whenever the\r\noccasion presents itself.\"\r\n\r\nTo the labor question also he wanted me to pay special attention because\r\nof my experience with such matters and in the arbitration of labor\r\ndisputes. He began with the statement that he was in favor of organized\r\ncapital and organized labor. I asked him whether right at that point I\r\nmight make a suggestion, which was that he begin with the general\r\nsubject of capital and labor, because organized labor did not comprise\r\nmore than fifteen per cent of the wage-earners of the country. This\r\nsuggestion he accepted.\r\n\r\nRoosevelt then expressed himself in favor of the eight-hour law. Messrs.\r\nMoody, Knox, Taft, and myself did not agree with his statement in the\r\nform he had it. We explained that there were several bills before\r\nCongress on the subject, some of which had passed the lower house, but\r\nwere defeated in the Senate; that it was all right for the Government in\r\nits own yards to adopt an eight-hour day, but when it gave out contracts\r\nto other shops, while it had a right to say that the work upon that\r\ncontract should be done by eight-hour days, it had no right to require\r\nwork on other contracts to be done in eight-hour days. When we had\r\ndiscussed the subject quite thoroughly, it was agreed to omit it from\r\nthe Message.\r\n\r\nNext he took up the trust question. He said Mr. Garfield had several\r\nsuggestions to offer for making the interstate commerce law effective.\r\nIt was generally agreed that the law as originally passed fully provided\r\nthe remedy that was intended, but it had been emasculated by the\r\ndecisions of the Supreme Court. Messrs. Knox, Taft, and Moody referred\r\nto several of these decisions and pointed out that the railroads, under\r\nsubterfuge of switches and free cars--cars that were furnished by such\r\nshippers as the beef trust--got completely around the law. They allowed\r\na mileage charge for the supply of these cars in excess of what should\r\nbe allowed, and under such cover it amounted to a rebate to those\r\nshippers and was a complete circumvention of the law. Garfield's\r\nsuggestion was that the interstate commerce corporations be compelled to\r\nobtain a license or charter from the National Government to do business.\r\nWe thoroughly discussed this, but it was disapproved as being an\r\ninterference with the legal rights of States, and that therefore no such\r\nlaw could be passed by Congress. The President then turned to the legal\r\nmembers of our group and said, \"Now here is a great wrong and you\r\nlawyers have always got a way of preventing us from reaching a remedy.\"\r\n\r\nKnox created a laugh by replying, \"The President wants us as usual to\r\njump over the Supreme Court.\"\r\n\r\nThe work on the Message done, Roosevelt said it was his intention to go\r\nSouth and make a few speeches. He would begin at San Antonio and would\r\nvisit Tuskegee and Sewanee Colleges, for he wanted his views in regard\r\nto the South and the negro question fully understood. He read us a draft\r\nalong the lines of thought he wanted to present, quoting much from\r\nLincoln, which seemed highly to the point. When some one mentioned the\r\ncurtailing of suffrage so as to have it based upon educational\r\nqualifications and property ownership, the President said it would not\r\nbe wise to agitate that subject, and that herein Booker Washington\r\nagreed with him; but, he added, \"There is something inherently wrong\r\nabout a Southern member representing in some instances only a quarter of\r\nthe number of votes that an Eastern member represents, and having an\r\nequal vote with him in Congress.\"\r\n\r\nIt was half after midnight when our little company separated. The\r\nPresident then suggested to Dr. Abbott and me that we meet at 8.15\r\nbreakfast, if we did not object to having this meal with him and the\r\nchildren. In the absence of Mrs. Roosevelt, who had gone to New York,\r\nthe President next morning took the head of the table, and with the\r\ncoffee urn before him served us each with our coffee, cream, and sugar.\r\nThere were Teddy, Ethel, Kermit, Archie, and Quentin, the governess, the\r\ntutor, besides Dr. Abbott, his son, and myself. After the meal we\r\nstrolled in the park back of the White House until 9.30, when the\r\nPresident left for his work-room in the new office building west of the\r\nWhite House.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI did not see Roosevelt again for several months. One day in May I took\r\nlunch with him upon his return from Chicago where he had had a\r\nconference with the representatives of the labor unions who were\r\ncarrying on the teamster's strike that paralyzed the commerce of the\r\ncity. He said he had received through his secretary my memorandum\r\nregarding an adjustment of the trouble, and that it was of great\r\nassistance to him in discussing the situation and coming to some\r\nequitable arrangement. He was preparing a Message for an extra session\r\nof Congress in October, and said he would send me parts of it,\r\nespecially those referring to immigration and the Far East, for my\r\nadvice and suggestion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1905, when Roosevelt was busy with negotiations to bring peace\r\nbetween Russia and Japan, I received a letter from him stating that he\r\nhad endeavored to get these two nations to go to The Hague, but Russia\r\nwas most reluctant and Japan positively refused; nor would they go to\r\neither Paris or Chefoo, but they were both willing to come to\r\nWashington. In his own \"Autobiography,\" which I never tire of reading,\r\nRoosevelt gives an interesting sketch of his mediation between these two\r\ncountries which finally brought about the conference and treaty at\r\nPortsmouth, New Hampshire.\r\n\r\nCount Sergius Witte, head of the Russian mission to Portsmouth, was\r\ndesirous of meeting some of the representative Jews of our country with\r\na view to seeking what might practicably be done to improve the\r\ncondition of the Jews in the Russian Empire. While it was said that his\r\nwife was a Jewess, his interest in the Jewish question was perhaps\r\nprimarily to improve the relations between Russia and the United States.\r\nThe Russian massacres, with the resultant enforced emigration, the\r\npublic meetings of protest in this country and the press comments, had\r\nseriously prejudiced public opinion here against Russia.\r\n\r\nThe Count therefore invited a committee to confer with him and Baron\r\nRosen at Portsmouth. There were Jacob H. Schiff, Isaac N. Seligman,\r\nAdolph Kraus, Adolf Lewisohn, and myself. The Count admitted with much\r\nfrankness the condition of the Jewish population of Russia, and that it\r\nwas an injustice. He expressed his purpose to exert his best influence\r\nto remedy the just grievances of the oppressed Jews. We assured him that\r\nwe asked for no special privileges for our co-religionists, but the\r\nsame, and no greater, rights for them than were accorded other Russian\r\nsubjects; that the granting of such rights would relieve Russia of the\r\nJewish question and of the international ill-will to which this question\r\nnaturally and rightly gave rise. Both the Count and Baron Rosen agreed\r\nwith us, but argued that it was not practicable to grant such complete\r\nemancipation, but that it should come about gradually. We told them, of\r\ncourse, that with that premise we could not and would not agree.\r\n\r\nThe Count was very much impressed with our presentation of the subject,\r\nand our statements were corroborated by his own observations later when\r\nhe made a visit to the lower East Side of New York where he spoke with a\r\nnumber of the Russian-Jewish immigrants. He said that upon his return to\r\nRussia he would at once take up the problem with a view ultimately to\r\nsecure equal rights for the Jewish subjects, that he realized the\r\nnecessity for this not only from a humanitarian standpoint, but from the\r\nstandpoint of Russia's best interests and of her relations with the\r\nleading nations of the world, particularly with the United States.\r\n\r\nBefore going to Portsmouth on Count Witte's invitation, I conferred with\r\nRoosevelt. He wanted me in an unofficial capacity to observe carefully\r\nthe progress of the negotiations and keep him advised. Just at that time\r\nit looked as if the conference might break up, and before that stage was\r\nactually reached he wanted to be notified, for he would probably have a\r\ncommunication to make to the commissioners. On arriving at Portsmouth I\r\nhad a confidential talk with Fedor Fedorovich Martens, the great Russian\r\ninternational jurist, who was one of my fellow members at the Hague\r\nTribunal, and with whom I had been in personal touch on several previous\r\noccasions. He was legal adviser to the Russian delegation. I apprised\r\nhim of what I knew to be the desire of the President, and he agreed that\r\nif a break became imminent, a communication such as the President would\r\nsend would be likely to have the right influence, and he would see to it\r\nthat, should the necessity arise for such a message, Roosevelt should be\r\npromptly informed. I advised the President of my understanding with\r\nMartens, but fortunately no rupture occurred and the terms of peace were\r\nagreed upon.\r\n\r\nIn his \"Autobiography\" Roosevelt says, with regard to these Portsmouth\r\nnegotiations: \"I had certainly tried my best to be the friend not only\r\nof the Japanese people but of the Russian people, and I believe that\r\nwhat I did was for the best interests of both and of the world at\r\nlarge.\" He refers with characteristic generosity to the help given him\r\nat St. Petersburg by our ambassador, George von Lengerke Meyer, who\r\n\"rendered literally invaluable aid by insisting upon himself seeing the\r\nCzar at critical periods of the transaction, when it was no longer\r\npossible for me to act successfully through the representatives of the\r\nCzar, who were often at cross-purposes with one another.\"\r\n\r\nAnd when the Portsmouth Conference was over, the President further took\r\na deep interest in bringing about amelioration of the condition of the\r\nJews in Russia. When Count Witte came to New York, Roosevelt wrote him\r\nthe following letter, of which he sent me a copy:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    OYSTER BAY, N.Y.\r\n                                                     _September 10, 1905_\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR MR. WITTE:\r\n\r\n     ... In furtherance of our conversation of last evening I beg you to\r\n     consider the question of granting passports to reputable American\r\n     citizens of Jewish faith. I feel that if this could be done it\r\n     would remove the last cause of irritation between the two nations\r\n     whose historic friendship for one another I wish to do my best to\r\n     maintain. You could always refuse to give a passport to any\r\n     American citizen, Jew or Gentile, unless you were thoroughly\r\n     satisfied that no detriment would come to Russia in granting it.\r\n     But if your Government could only see its way clear to allowing\r\n     reputable American citizens of Jewish faith, as to whose intentions\r\n     they are satisfied, to come to Russia, just as you do reputable\r\n     American Christians, I feel it would be from every standpoint most\r\n     fortunate.\r\n\r\n     Again assuring you of my high regard, and renewing my\r\n     congratulations to you and to your country upon the peace that has\r\n     been obtained, believe me,\r\n\r\n                            Sincerely yours\r\n                                           THEODORE ROOSEVELT\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in 1906, when the Algeciras Conference regarding Morocco was in\r\nsession, and the press reported that it was likely to break up without\r\nan agreement on account of Germany's attitude, Carl Schurz, knowing of\r\nmy close relationship with Roosevelt, wrote to me that the President\r\ncould probably prevail upon the Powers concerned to refer the question\r\nto the Hague Tribunal. This letter I forwarded to Roosevelt; but\r\nalthough he was ever ready to vitalize the machinery of the Hague\r\nTribunal, advice coming from Mr. Schurz at this time was not regarded\r\nwith favor, possibly because of their previous differences. In his reply\r\nto me, however, the President showed what a clear and prophetic insight\r\nhe had into Germany's attitude and purposes:\r\n\r\n     Modern Germany is alert, aggressive, military and industrial. It\r\n     thinks it is a match for England and France combined in war, and\r\n     would probably be less reluctant to fight both those powers\r\n     together than they would be together to fight it. It despises the\r\n     Hague Conference and the whole Hague idea. It respects the United\r\n     States only in so far as it believes that our navy is efficient and\r\n     that if sufficiently wronged or insulted we would fight. Now I like\r\n     and respect Germany, but I am not blind to the fact that Germany\r\n     does not reciprocate the feeling. I want us to do everything we can\r\n     to stay on good terms with Germany, but I would be a fool if I were\r\n     blind to the fact that Germany will not stay in with us if we\r\n     betray weakness. As for this particular case, when I see you next I\r\n     shall tell you all that I have done and you will see that I have\r\n     been using my very best efforts for peace.\r\n\r\nIn all my relations with Roosevelt, even before I became a member of his\r\nCabinet, I was more and more convinced that no consideration of\r\npolitical self-interest or partisan advantage ever entered his mind in\r\ndetermining his attitude or action in upholding the right or dethroning\r\na wrong. He resented nothing more than when some politician or\r\ninconsiderate person made an appeal to him for action on the plea that\r\nit would be good politics. He was visioned, but not visionary; and\r\nwithal highly practical, in that he understood the workings and\r\ntendencies of human forces. Just as he would read a book by absorbing a\r\npage at a glance, so he would instinctively appraise his fellow men;\r\ntheir qualities would impress him just as a brilliant paragraph in a\r\nbook would arrest his instant attention.\r\n\r\nRoosevelt would not make an idle gesture or even imply a threat which he\r\ndid not purpose to carry into action. He was more abused by those whom\r\nhe designated as \"the interests,\" and better understood and trusted by\r\nthe masses, than any President in our history with the exception of\r\nLincoln. So it is always with real leaders, who seek to guide rather\r\nthan pander to public opinion. The latter course appeals to weak though\r\nwell-intentioned public men; the former requires not only clear vision\r\nbut high courage, and these qualities Roosevelt possessed to an\r\nextraordinary degree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nINDUSTRIAL DIPLOMACY\r\n\r\n     Trade unions and federated unions--Formation of the National Civic\r\n     Federation--Notable industrial disputes are settled--Andrew\r\n     Carnegie dines with fighting labor leaders--Marcus Hanna, general\r\n     of industry--My chairmanship of the Board of Railway Labor\r\n     Arbitration--Our findings and recommendations--My chairmanship of\r\n     the New York Public Service Commission--Military necessities\r\n     impinge upon industrial relations--The President's Industrial\r\n     Conference of 1919-20.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen our industries were small, a strong human tie bound together\r\nemployer and worker. Following the expansion which began after the Civil\r\nWar, our industries resolved themselves into vast organizations and\r\ncorporations, and the relations between employer and worker became more\r\nand more impersonal. The workers first organized into trade unions,\r\nwhich presently expanded into federated unions similar to those which a\r\ngeneration before had begun to be formed in Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThe rapid growth of our industries and the impersonal relations between\r\nemployer and employed made it apparent that social justice required that\r\nreciprocal rights be recognized in order to bring about a better\r\nunderstanding of a relationship which had already become increasingly\r\nstrained and often embittered, resulting in serious strikes and\r\nlock-outs. One of the first organizations to meet this need was formed\r\nin Chicago in 1894, following the Pullman strike. It was called the\r\nCivic Federation of Chicago and was under the leadership of a number of\r\nprominent men of that city, directed by Ralph M. Easley.\r\n\r\nSix years later the scope of this organization was enlarged, and in the\r\nname of the National Civic Federation a conference was called in\r\nChicago, in December, 1900, and the debate centered round the\r\nproposition that in American industries voluntary conciliation was\r\npreferable to compulsory arbitration. At that conference a committee was\r\nselected whose duty it was to collect information at home and abroad\r\nregarding measures of arbitration, and to advise with employers and\r\nworkmen in this country whenever and wherever possible.\r\n\r\nIn the following December, 1901, the National Civic Federation held a\r\nconference in New York in the rooms of the New York Board of Trade and\r\nTransportation. I was then president of that Board and was asked to\r\npreside at the conference. After adjourning the sessions, we organized\r\nthe industrial department of the Federation, with a committee of twelve\r\nmen representing the public, twelve men representing employers, and\r\ntwelve men representing wage-earners. These three groups were headed,\r\nrespectively, by Grover Cleveland, Marcus A. Hanna, and Samuel Gompers.\r\nAll of their colleagues were men of national distinction and were\r\nrecognized leaders in their fields. From this larger committee of\r\nthirty-six, an executive committee of five was selected, whose members\r\nwere as follows: Marcus A. Hanna, chairman; Samuel Gompers, first\r\nvice-president; I, second vice-president; Charles A. Moore, treasurer;\r\nand Ralph M. Easley, secretary.\r\n\r\nThe scope and plan of the industrial department was to promote\r\nindustrial peace in whatever way might seem best. We planned for a large\r\nmeeting in May, when two public sessions were to be held, one at Cooper\r\nUnion and one in the rooms of the New York Chamber of Commerce. We\r\nissued a statement of our plan and scope and inaugurated a broad\r\neducational campaign.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile our department proved itself most practical. It actively\r\nhelped settle several disputes, notably the Albany street-car strike,\r\nthe disagreement between the National Metal Trades Association and the\r\nInternational Association of Machinists, and the United States steel\r\nstrike. And it was instrumental in averting the threatened anthracite\r\ncoal strike.\r\n\r\nThe identical ideal that I held up in my opening address at the meeting\r\nin January, 1901, I should hold up to-day: namely, that industrial\r\npeace, to be permanent, cannot rest upon force, but must rest upon\r\njustice, and in essential industries especially, upon a high sense of\r\nresponsibility to the public by both employer and employed. In no other\r\ncountry are conditions, by nature and by principles of government,\r\nbetter adapted to the equitable adjustment of the reciprocal rights,\r\nduties, and privileges of labor and capital than in our own, because we\r\nare a democratic people with no fixed class distinctions to separate us.\r\nThe laborer of to-day may be the capitalist of to-morrow, and vice\r\nversa. Capital and labor are interdependent, not opponents; and it is on\r\nthe basis of that dependency that adjustments in the relationship\r\nbetween them must be made. This ideal is, happily, more widely\r\nrecognized to-day than it was when the National Civic Federation was\r\norganized.\r\n\r\nI gave considerable attention to the work of the Federation for a number\r\nof years. As the offices were in New York and the president and first\r\nvice-president were both resident in other cities, the direction of the\r\norganization between conferences largely fell upon me as second\r\nvice-president, with the important assistance of the secretary, Mr.\r\nEasley.\r\n\r\nThe Federation afforded a neutral forum where, under the chairmanship of\r\none of its officers, the disputants could discuss their grievances and\r\narrive at an understanding. Many times the growing bitterness between\r\nthem was checked and a strike or lock-out averted. The fact was often\r\nborne in upon me how many of these industrial disputes grew out of\r\nmisunderstandings which were cleared away when men assembled around a\r\ntable and frankly discussed their differences.\r\n\r\nTo further the work and interests of the Federation I brought together\r\nin social relationship, at several dinners at my home, the\r\nrepresentatives of all three groups; namely, the public, the\r\nwage-earner, and the employer. One day Andrew Carnegie expressed the\r\ndesire to meet the labor leaders who had instigated the strike in the\r\nCarnegie works which resulted in the Homestead riots. Accordingly I\r\narranged a dinner, to which I invited a number of the men of the labor\r\nwing of the Federation, as well as some others of the committee,\r\ntogether with Messrs. Wighe and Schaeffer, of Pittsburgh, officers of\r\nthe Amalgamated Union, who had led the Homestead strike.\r\n\r\nCarnegie knew these leaders well, and they knew him. He called them by\r\ntheir Christian names and they called him \"Andy.\" They said that night\r\nthat they and their colleagues in the union had always believed that\r\nthat strike and riot would never have taken place had \"Andy\" been\r\npresent. As a matter of fact, Carnegie's relations with his men had\r\nalways been very friendly. He was unjustly accused of the responsibility\r\nfor the Homestead riots, which might not have occurred had he, instead\r\nof Mr. Frick, been in charge of the employers' side. Mr. Carnegie at the\r\ntime was in Scotland.\r\n\r\nOnly a short while before this Carnegie dinner, Marcus Hanna had died,\r\nand our executive committee offered to Mr. Carnegie the presidency of\r\nthe Federation, to succeed Mr. Hanna. Mr. Carnegie was gratified and\r\nvery much touched, especially by the implied confidence on the part of\r\nthe twelve labor men of the Federation; but on account of his advanced\r\nyears he felt that he could not give the position the attention it\r\ndeserved. He was, however, glad to become a member of the executive\r\ncommittee, and as such revealed himself in a most favorable light.\r\nBeneath his Scotch nimbleness of mind there was a broad, tolerant, and\r\nlovable heart. He met the laboring men, not as their superior, but as\r\none having a genuine brotherly interest in their welfare. It became very\r\nevident to us all why he was so highly regarded by his workmen, and why\r\nhe had so much influence with them: they trusted to his fairness and had\r\na real affection for him personally. In his Autobiography he makes\r\nfeeling reference to his connection with the Federation.\r\n\r\nMarcus Hanna, who was known to the country chiefly through his political\r\nactivities, was looked upon as the leader of a group of rich men who had\r\nwon political power by commercializing our political system; and was\r\nregarded by many as an evil influence. But in connection with the great\r\nindustrial interests that he had built up in Ohio and elsewhere--coal\r\nmines, iron works, shipping, street railways--little was known of him.\r\nHe had shown great capacity as an industrial general in the management\r\nof his men, winning their good-will by fair and equitable treatment; and\r\nit is said he never had a strike in the industries he administered. He\r\nwas highly regarded by the labor leaders, who had confidence in his\r\nfairness to the wage-earners. He did not oppose, as did so many of the\r\nemployers of his time, the organization of labor unions. On the\r\ncontrary, he believed that such organizations were necessary adequately\r\nto protect the rights of the workers.\r\n\r\nAs chairman of the executive committee of the Civic Federation, Hanna\r\ndisplayed this better side of his character and his great ability as an\r\norganizer and a leader. Here he was not the cunning politician, but the\r\ngenial head of an industry who recognized the just demands of the\r\nwage-earners and was always generous with them in regard to compensation\r\nand labor conditions.\r\n\r\nThe work we did and the experiences we encountered as officers of the\r\nFederation, each group coming into close contact with the others and\r\nadjusting with them industrial differences, had a decided educational\r\nvalue for us all. For myself, the study I gave during these years to the\r\nrelations between capital and labor, and my active part in the\r\nconciliation and arbitration of labor disputes, provided me with an\r\nintensely practical background and preparation for the secretaryship of\r\nthe Department of Commerce and Labor, which later fell to my lot. It was\r\nthis experience and my personal acquaintance with the representatives of\r\ncapital and labor all over the country that induced me, as head of that\r\nDepartment, to organize the Council of Commerce and to plan the Council\r\nof Labor, to both of which I shall refer more specifically later.\r\n\r\nThe Board of Railway Labor Arbitration of 1912 was perhaps the most\r\nimportant labor arbitration body brought into existence up to that time.\r\nIts decisions affected the whole Eastern district: that is, that section\r\nof our country lying east of Chicago and East St. Louis, and north of\r\nthe Ohio River to Parkersburg, West Virginia, and of the Potomac River\r\nto its mouth. Fifty-two railroad lines and over thirty-one thousand\r\nengineers were involved. The latter negotiated through the Brotherhood\r\nof Locomotive Engineers.\r\n\r\nThe representatives of the Brotherhood and the members of the Conference\r\nCommittee of Managers of the railroads held several conferences in\r\nMarch, 1912, at which the Brotherhood made certain requests. The\r\nconferences ended with the refusal of the roads to grant these requests\r\nor any part of them, whereupon ninety-three per cent of the members\r\nvoted for a strike. Charles P. Neill, United States Commissioner of\r\nLabor, and Judge Martin A. Knapp, of the United States Commerce Court,\r\ntendered their friendly offices under the Erdman Act, but were unable to\r\nmediate, and the contending parties would not agree to arbitrate under\r\nthe provisions of the Erdman Act. It was then decided to submit the\r\ndispute to a board of arbitration composed of seven members, one to be\r\nchosen by each side, and those two to agree on the other five within\r\nfifteen days of their own appointment.\r\n\r\nThe roads chose Daniel Willard, president of the Baltimore and Ohio\r\nRailroad, and the Brotherhood chose P. H. Morrissey, former grand master\r\nof the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen. At the end of fifteen days,\r\nthese two had not succeeded in agreeing upon the other five members of\r\nthe board, though they had agreed upon a list from which the five might\r\nbe chosen. A committee consisting of Mr. Neill, Judge Knapp, and Chief\r\nJustice White, of the Supreme Court of the United States, then chose\r\nfive names from that list, and the final personnel of the board was as\r\nfollows: Dr. Charles R. Van Hise, of Madison, Wisconsin; Frederick N.\r\nJudson, of St. Louis; Dr. Albert Shaw, Otto M. Eidlitz, and myself, of\r\nNew York, in addition to Mr. Morrissey and Mr. Willard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Copyright by American Press Association_\r\n\r\nMEMBERS OF THE RAILWAY BOARD OF ARBITRATION\r\n\r\nFrom left to right: Standing: Daniel Willard, Otto M. Eidlitz, Albert\r\nShaw, P.H. Morrissey Sitting: Charles R. Van Hise, Oscar S. Straus,\r\nFrederick N. Judson]\r\n\r\nOn July 12th the board met and organized, electing me as chairman. The\r\ndecisions of the board were to be binding for one year and thereafter\r\ncould be terminated by either side upon a thirty days' notice. For two\r\nweeks we held hearings, morning and afternoon, at the Oriental Hotel,\r\nManhattan Beach, New York. When the hearings were over, the board\r\nadjourned until early September, when the work of making the awards was\r\nbegun. Because of my nomination for Governor by the Progressive Party at\r\nthe time, I found it advisable to relinquish the chairmanship of the\r\nboard to Dr. Van Hise, although I continued my membership and active\r\ninterest to the end.\r\n\r\nThe hearings were reported and consisted of 1250 pages of testimony. The\r\nquestions that confronted the board were not alone whether or not the\r\nwages in a given case should be raised, but, if it was found that the\r\nrate was inadequate, by what margin should it be increased? It was\r\nfairly difficult to arrive at principles of standardization applicable\r\nto so many roads, and to fix a basis of differentiation for the many and\r\ncomplicated branches of employment. The whole subject, however, had our\r\nmost careful and painstaking consideration. We took up the whole\r\nintricate problem of the running of railroads, with relation to the\r\nseveral kinds of work performed by the engineers, in passenger service,\r\nfreight service, in switching, and in yard work, bearing in mind always\r\nthat railways were public utilities and that the necessities and comfort\r\nof the whole people depended upon their functioning; and that therefore\r\nthe necessity for uninterrupted service far transcended the interests of\r\neither the roads on the one side or the employees on the other.\r\n\r\nOur decisions as finally printed made a book of one hundred and\r\ntwenty-three pages. One of our chief recommendations was that National\r\nand State wage commissions be created which should function in relation\r\nto labor engaged in public utilities as the public service commissions\r\nfunctioned toward capital. I quote from the report:\r\n\r\n     Especially for the public utilities is it important that labor\r\n     should have a just wage, and if the existing wages are not\r\n     adequate, they should be increased. If a just increase in wages\r\n     places the public utilities in a position that does not enable them\r\n     to secure a fair return upon capital invested and maintain a proper\r\n     reserve, they should be allowed to increase their rates until they\r\n     are in that position.\r\n\r\nAnother point upon which we laid stress was the limitation of the right\r\nto strike:\r\n\r\n     While it is clear from the public point of view that a concerted\r\n     strike of railway employees for a great region would be as\r\n     intolerable as a strike of the postal clerks; on the other hand,\r\n     the position of the employees is a very natural one. They feel\r\n     under existing conditions that the power to strike is their only\r\n     weapon of defense against employers and the only means by which\r\n     they can enforce a betterment of their conditions of service. They\r\n     realize, too, that the principle of concerted action, for all the\r\n     railroads in a great section of the country, gives them a most\r\n     effective weapon, and they are naturally loath to relinquish or\r\n     impair it.\r\n\r\n     While this is the situation under the present conditions, and the\r\n     railway employees feel that they cannot surrender their right to\r\n     strike, the necessity would no longer exist for the exercise of\r\n     this power, if there were a wage commission which would secure them\r\n     just wages.\r\n\r\n     Finally, it is the belief of the Board that in the last analysis\r\n     the only solution--unless we are to rely solely upon the\r\n     restraining power of public opinion--is to qualify the principle of\r\n     free contract in the railroad service. A strike in the army or navy\r\n     is mutiny and universally punished as such. The same principle is\r\n     applied to seamen because of the public necessity involved. A\r\n     strike among postal clerks, as among the teachers of our public\r\n     schools, would be unthinkable. In all these cases, the employment,\r\n     to borrow a legal phrase, is affected with a public use; and this\r\n     of necessity qualifies the right of free concerted action which\r\n     exists in private employments.\r\n\r\n     However, if the principle be accepted that there are certain\r\n     classes of service thus affected with a public interest and men who\r\n     enter them are not free concertedly to quit the service, then these\r\n     men must be guarded in the matter of wages and conditions by public\r\n     protection; and this it is believed can best be done through an\r\n     interstate wage commission.\r\n\r\nThe report was signed by six members of the board, Mr. Willard adding an\r\nexplanatory statement. Mr. Morrissey wrote a dissenting opinion. For a\r\nnumber of years the findings of this board, with slight alterations,\r\ncontinued to be effective in adjusting wages for the different kinds of\r\nservice among the engineers, and in governing conditions and number of\r\nworking hours of the employees.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe President's Industrial Conference of 1919-20, of which I was a\r\nmember, was of value chiefly in that it correlated the best ideas in\r\npractice throughout the country with regard to the prevention and relief\r\nof industrial unrest and the betterment in general of the relationship\r\nbetween employer and employee, and that it published suggestions based\r\non these ideas, of which the main points were the following:\r\n\r\n     1. The parties to the dispute may voluntarily submit their\r\n     differences for settlement to a board, known as a Regional\r\n     Adjustment Conference. This board consists of four representatives\r\n     selected by the parties, and four others in their industry chosen\r\n     by them and familiar with their problems. The board is presided\r\n     over by a trained government official, the regional chairman, who\r\n     acts as a conciliator. If a unanimous agreement is reached, it\r\n     results in a collective bargain having the same effect as if\r\n     reached by joint organization in the shop.\r\n\r\n     2. If the Regional Conference fails to agree unanimously, the\r\n     matter, with certain restrictions, goes, under the agreement of\r\n     submission, to the National Industrial Board, unless the parties\r\n     prefer the decision of an umpire selected by them.\r\n\r\n     3. The voluntary submission to a Regional Adjustment Conference\r\n     carries with it an agreement by both parties that there shall be no\r\n     interference with production pending the processes of adjustment.\r\n\r\n     4. If the parties, or either of them, refuse voluntarily to submit\r\n     the dispute to the processes of the plan of adjustment, a Regional\r\n     Board of Inquiry is formed by the regional chairman, of two\r\n     employers and two employees from the industry, and not parties to\r\n     the dispute. This Board has the right, under proper safeguards, to\r\n     subpoena witnesses and records, and the duty to publish its\r\n     findings as a guide to public opinion.\r\n\r\n     5. The National Industrial Board in Washington has general\r\n     oversight of the working of the plan.\r\n\r\n     6. The plan is applicable also to public utilities, but in such\r\n     cases, the government agency, having power to regulate the service,\r\n     has two representatives in the Adjustment Conference. Provision is\r\n     made for prompt report of its findings to the rate regulating body.\r\n     The Conference makes no recommendation of a plan to cover steam\r\n     railroads and other carriers, for which legislation has recently\r\n     been enacted by Congress. (Esch-Cummins Bill.)\r\n\r\n     7. The plan provides machinery for prompt and fair adjustment of\r\n     wages and working conditions of government employees. It is\r\n     especially necessary for this class of employees, who should not be\r\n     permitted to strike.\r\n\r\n     8. The plan involves no penalties other than those imposed by\r\n     public opinion. It does not impose compulsory arbitration. It does\r\n     not deny the right to strike. It does not submit to arbitration the\r\n     policy of the \"closed\" or \"open\" shop.\r\n\r\n     9. The plan is national in scope and operation, yet it is\r\n     decentralized. It is different from anything in operation\r\n     elsewhere. It is based upon American experience and is designed to\r\n     meet American conditions. It employs no legal authority except the\r\n     right of inquiry. Its basic idea is stimulation to settlement of\r\n     differences by the parties in conflict, and the enlistment of\r\n     public opinion toward enforcing that method of settlement.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately nothing came of the painstaking work of this conference\r\nbeyond the publishing of its final report of March 6, 1920.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe chairmanship of the New York Public Service Commission did not at\r\nall appeal to me when first Governor Whitman offered it to me. The\r\ncommission as it then existed had unfortunately lost public confidence\r\nto a large extent, and I felt that it was not the kind of service for\r\nwhich I was especially qualified. However, it was pointed out to me that\r\nthere was constant danger of strikes on the part of the thousands of\r\nworkmen engaged in the construction of subway and elevated extensions,\r\nand an added appeal was made to me in view of the considerable\r\nexperience I had had in adjusting labor difficulties. And so, after\r\ndeclining, I was finally prevailed upon by the Governor and the late\r\nGeorge W. Perkins, in December, 1915, to accept this arduous duty.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it became known that I had accepted the chairmanship, the\r\nGovernor received a communication from William Henry Hodge, the\r\ndistinguished engineer, announcing his willingness to serve on the\r\ncommission, although before my selection he had refused such\r\nappointment. The other members of the commission were: Charles E.\r\nHervey, William Hayward, and Traverse H. Whitney. Messrs. Hayward and\r\nHodge left the commission, when we entered the war, to join the army.\r\nMr. Hayward was commissioned Colonel, having organized the 15th New\r\nYork, afterward the 369th United States Infantry, a regiment of colored\r\nmen who performed gallant service in France. Mr. Hodge was commissioned\r\nMajor and was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel, and gave his splendid\r\ntalents to the services of his country in building roads to the battle\r\nfronts of France. Due to his strenuous labors over there, this gifted\r\nengineer and exemplary patriot died shortly after the armistice.\r\n\r\nThe commission had charge of the building of the subways and elevated\r\nlines then in process, as well as the regulation of traffic and all\r\npublic utilities. As the war progressed, it became clearer that our\r\ncountry would inevitably be drawn in, and therefore increasingly\r\nimportant that nothing should prevent the functioning of our public\r\nutilities. And accordingly it was not long before my services as\r\nadjuster and arbitrator of labor difficulties were needed. The cost of\r\nliving was rapidly rising, and there was great unrest among laborers;\r\nand the demand for skilled and unskilled labor grew day by day. When our\r\ncountry entered the war, it was highly important for the moral effect\r\nupon our own people, as well as to avoid giving encouragement to our\r\nenemies, that the transportation system of our greatest metropolis\r\nshould operate without interruption. During the following year and a\r\nhalf I was able to adjust a dozen or more important labor disputes and\r\nto prevent a number of strikes. The situation was complicated by the\r\nfact that the laborers were not employees of the commission, but of the\r\nseveral contractors to whom contracts had been awarded under conditions\r\nof fierce competition, so that every increase in wages materially\r\naffected their profits and in the end caused many of them to suffer\r\nconsiderable loss. I had to appeal to the patriotism of both sides, and\r\nit is a pleasure to be able to state that in every instance the response\r\nwas most gratifying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nIN THE CABINET\r\n\r\n     Roosevelt offers me a place in his Cabinet--I retire permanently\r\n     from private business--I become Secretary of the Department of\r\n     Commerce and Labor---The scope of the department--My bureau\r\n     chiefs--At home in the Venetian Palace--Cabinet dinners--What\r\n     Roosevelt drank--Roosevelt's fondness for terrapin--South Carolina\r\n     labor immigration--The Japanese question; the \"Gentlemen's\r\n     Agreement\"; General Kuroki's visit; the courts and Japanese\r\n     naturalization--My trip to Hawaii; Viscount Ishii--Japanese\r\n     transits between Canada and Mexico; Japanese immigration\r\n     statistics; I suggest a naturalization treaty with\r\n     Japan--Anti-Japanese agitation renewed in California--The Four\r\n     Power Treaty of the Washington Conference--Immigration head tax\r\n     immunity for diplomats--Revision of naturalization laws; prevention\r\n     of fraudulent naturalization--More frequent steamboat inspection\r\n     --The Alaskan salmon fisheries--Organization of the Council of\r\n     Commerce, predecessor to the Chamber of Commerce of the United\r\n     States--The Council of Labor--Roosevelt's Nobel Peace Prize\r\n     Foundation--A visit to Georgia; my old homes at Columbus and\r\n     Talbotton--Quentin Roosevelt--Social life in Washington; Christmas\r\n     celebration in the White House; the President's New Year's\r\n     reception; I give the last Cabinet dinner.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore I became a member of President Roosevelt's official family, I was\r\nin what he termed his \"kitchen cabinet.\" My experiences in both cabinets\r\nare among the treasured recollections of my life.\r\n\r\nWe were the unofficial advisers who met round the luncheon and dinner\r\ntable and afterwards in the White House study, where the President spoke\r\nwithout reserve of his executive problems and read for our criticism and\r\ncounsel his rough drafts of congressional messages, speeches, and notes\r\nto foreign governments.\r\n\r\nHolding no portfolios of state, these \"kitchen cabinet ministers\" yet\r\ngave of their best; were always prepared to toil to any extent to be of\r\nassistance to the President. He had the quality of vitalizing things--a\r\nsituation or condition coming within his executive ken became so\r\ncharged with life and imagination that men wanted to put their hands and\r\nminds to it. They served Roosevelt as energetically and loyally as if\r\nthe grave responsibilities of state were upon their own shoulders.\r\n\r\nInternational relations and labor arbitration were the public activities\r\nwhich interested me most. The President had appointed me a member of the\r\npermanent board of arbitration at The Hague to succeed the late Benjamin\r\nHarrison, and shortly thereafter in his charming manner had designated\r\nme as a member of his \"kitchen cabinet.\" Thus there had commenced for me\r\na memorable series of conferences.\r\n\r\nThere is much misapprehension regarding Roosevelt's so-called\r\nimpulsiveness. This was evident to those who had an intimate view of the\r\nman at work. He was quick. He was a prodigious worker. He was so\r\nconstituted and so self-trained that he had to do things immediately,\r\nget them out of the way. What people called his impulsiveness might have\r\nbeen more aptly termed his preparedness.\r\n\r\nI had hundreds of opportunities to observe his methods. When he accepted\r\nan invitation to deliver an address or write an article, he would\r\nprepare it immediately, even if the occasion were two, three, or six\r\nmonths off. He revised considerably, showed his work freely to friends\r\nand associates for criticisms, but completed it at the earliest\r\nopportunity. He never waited. This method served to perfect his thought\r\nand expression on a given subject. His promptness left him free for\r\nother things.\r\n\r\nThe President never seemed to be hurried, though he always worked with a\r\nwonderful driving force. He seemed never to waste any time. It was play\r\nor work, and both with his whole heart.\r\n\r\nHis public addresses were almost invariably the result of preparation.\r\nIt was seldom that he spoke extemporaneously. The fire and animation\r\nwhich he imparted in the delivery of his speeches certainly conveyed no\r\nimpression that they might have been carefully prepared and considered\r\nat a desk in a study. The pages of his manuscript were so small and\r\ninconspicuous that they did not interfere with his natural gestures. The\r\neffect was almost as if he spoke extemporaneously. The written address,\r\nprinted on sheets about 3 x 6 inches, and held in one hand, was\r\ncompletely lost sight of by the audience in those moments when Colonel\r\nRoosevelt became emphatic. In those moments he also interspersed\r\nextemporaneous remarks which brought out his arguments more vividly and\r\nforcefully.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI stopped in Washington and called on President Roosevelt, early in\r\nJanuary of 1906, on my return from a short vacation in the South. He\r\ntook me into his private room, where we found his personal and political\r\nfriend, James H. Sheffield, and Senator Spooner. He spoke about the\r\npolitical changes in New York, the defeat of the machine in that State,\r\nthe election of Herbert Parsons as chairman of the County Committee, and\r\nof young Wadsworth (now United States Senator), son-in-law of John Hay,\r\nas Speaker of the House. He took a special delight in the election of\r\nboth of these men; he had a high regard for them personally and for what\r\nthey stood. He said he had written a letter to Parsons which he hoped\r\nwould be helpful to him.\r\n\r\nThe President asked me to come to lunch with him, which was another of\r\nthose delightful, informal meetings. Besides Mrs. Roosevelt, his\r\ndaughter Alice, and her fiance, there were William Dudley Foulke, a\r\nformer colleague of the President on the Civil Service Commission and\r\nfriend of mine from my college days; Robert Hitt son of Congressman\r\nHitt; and Lieutenant Fortesque, an officer of the Rough Riders.\r\n\r\nAfter luncheon, the President asked me to wait for him in the Red Room,\r\nas he wanted to have a talk with me. When the other guests had departed,\r\nhe came back to me and with his face beaming with geniality he said: \"I\r\ndon't know whether you know it or not, but I want you to become a member\r\nof my Cabinet. I have a very high estimate of your character, your\r\njudgment, and your ability, and I want you for personal reasons. There\r\nis still a further reason: I want to show Russia and some other\r\ncountries what we think of the Jews in this country.\"\r\n\r\nOf course I was gratified, very much gratified. I told him I had heard\r\nfrom several persons that he had spoken of this intention, but that I\r\nhad meant to take no notice of it until he should speak to me about it;\r\nthat I should certainly esteem it the very highest honor to become a\r\nmember of the Cabinet, and especially to have the privilege of working\r\nalongside of him.\r\n\r\n\"I knew you would feel just that way; therefore I was anxious to let you\r\nknow of my intention as long in advance as possible,\" replied the\r\nPresident. He said all this in such a cordial and affectionate manner\r\nthat I was profoundly touched with this manifestation of close\r\nfriendship for me.\r\n\r\nHe then added that he could not see that it would do any good, and might\r\ndo harm, to make further protests or utterances regarding the massacres\r\nin Russia under the disorganized conditions there; and he did not want\r\nto do anything that might sound well here and have just the opposite\r\neffect there. He thought it would be much more pointed evidence of our\r\nGovernment's interest if he put a man like me into his Cabinet, and that\r\nsuch a course would doubtless have a greater influence than any words\r\nwith the countries in which unreasonable discrimination and prejudice\r\nprevailed.\r\n\r\nHe told me that it might be July or even later before he could carry out\r\nhis purpose. He would prefer to put me at the head of the Department of\r\nCommerce and Labor, because of my knowledge in that field, but he could\r\nnot determine the specific position until later. But at any rate, I was\r\nto regard my appointment to one of the Cabinet positions as certain.\r\n\r\nHe asked whether I knew Senator Platt, and indicated that it might be\r\nwell for several of my friends to have a talk with the Senator. But he\r\nquickly added that it would make no difference to him whether it suited\r\nthe New York Senator or not, though it might perhaps be a little more\r\nagreeable if I did not have the latter's opposition. I preferred to feel\r\nthat my selection was personal, which it really was, and without even\r\nthe semblance of political influence; so I did not ask any of my friends\r\nto speak to Senator Platt, nor did I think he would oppose me.\r\n\r\nMy wife and the rest of my family were of course elated at hearing the\r\nnews, particularly my brother Isidor, whose attitude toward me, his\r\nyoungest brother, was always more like that of an affectionate father\r\nthan a brother. I felt no trepidation, especially should I be selected\r\nfor the Department of Commerce and Labor. My past training and interest\r\nin many of the subjects that came up under that department made me\r\nconversant with the main questions it had to administer.\r\n\r\nUpon my return to New York I began to make arrangements for severing all\r\nbusiness connections. This I thought wise, particularly if I became head\r\nof the Department of Commerce and Labor. It was not a necessary step,\r\nbut I wanted it never to be said that I advocated any measure or made\r\nany decision that might in the remotest way be of advantage to my\r\nprivate interests. I spoke to Roosevelt about my intention, and he said\r\nthat while it was not essential, if I could do so it would on the whole\r\nbe advisable; that situated similarly he would do the same thing\r\nhimself. Before assuming office, therefore, I had retired from business\r\nfor good, and I have not since that time been connected with any\r\nbusiness for personal profit.\r\n\r\nMy nomination was officially made in September, but it was not until\r\nearly December, 1906, that I received a letter from William Loeb, Jr.,\r\nthe President's secretary, notifying me that the President desired me to\r\nassume office on December 17th. On that day, accordingly, I appeared at\r\n9 A.M. at the Department of Commerce and Labor, then located in the\r\nWillard Building across the street from the Hotel Willard on Fourteenth\r\nStreet. There I met my predecessor, Victor H. Metcalf, who had been\r\nappointed Secretary of the Navy. Mr. Metcalf welcomed me in a brief\r\naddress and introduced me to the twelve bureau and five division chiefs\r\nof the department.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Commerce and Labor was the youngest of the nine\r\ndepartments of the Government, the bill creating it having been approved\r\nby President Roosevelt on February 14, 1903. Roosevelt had done much to\r\nestablish the department and took great pride in it. The first Secretary\r\nof Commerce and Labor was George B. Cortelyou, who had been secretary to\r\nthe President, and by reason of his intimate relations with the\r\nofficials of the Government was admirably equipped to organize this\r\ndepartment, which he did with great skill and administrative ability.\r\nAfter holding the office for about a year and a half, Secretary\r\nCortelyou became Postmaster-General, and Victor H. Metcalf, Congressman\r\nfrom California, was appointed, thereby becoming the next Secretary of\r\nthe Department on July 1, 1904; I was therefore the third.\r\n\r\nThe scope of the Department as constituted then was probably the largest\r\nof the nine branches of the Government. It was charged with the work of\r\npromoting the commerce, mining, manufacturing, shipping, and fishery\r\nindustries of the country, as well as its transportation facilities and\r\nits labor interests; in addition it had jurisdiction over the entire\r\nsubject of immigration. It had twelve bureaus: corporations;\r\nmanufactures; labor; lighthouses; census; coast and geodetic survey;\r\nstatistics, including foreign commerce; steamboat inspection;\r\nimmigration and naturalization; and standards.\r\n\r\nIn order to cooerdinate the work of these various bureaus I instituted\r\nthe simple method employed by large business administrators of having\r\nthe several bureau chiefs come together with me twice a month to discuss\r\nand confer regarding the more important administrative subjects. This\r\nenabled me to keep better informed and served to make the various heads\r\nof bureaus conversant with the whole scope of the Department, preventing\r\noverlapping and duplication of functions. I learned that this simple\r\nadministrative method had never been made use of before in federal\r\ndepartments, but thereafter it was adopted by several of the other\r\ndepartment heads.\r\n\r\nThanks to Mr. Cortelyou's admirable organization of the department, I\r\nfound, almost without exception, a fine and competent set of men in\r\ncharge of its several branches. Some of them were friends of Roosevelt,\r\nmembers of his \"tennis cabinet,\" and were thoroughly imbued with his\r\nspirit and ideals. The assistant secretary was Lawrence O. Murray, a\r\ncapable and conscientious official. James R. Garfield, chief of the\r\nBureau of Corporations, devoted himself to the difficult task of\r\nexposing the abuses and legal infractions of some of the great\r\ncorporations, and did it with judgment and ability, and with conspicuous\r\ncourage. Charles P. Neill, chief of the Bureau of Labor, a laboring man\r\nin his early days, and afterwards an instructor at Notre Dame, and\r\nprofessor of economics at the Catholic University, in Washington, D.C.,\r\nwas eminently qualified for his duties and had the confidence alike of\r\nlabor leaders and employers. Dr. Samuel W. Stratton, a scientist of\r\ndistinction and a fine administrator, was then chief of the Bureau of\r\nStandards, a veritable institution of science.\r\n\r\nFortunately, when the Department of Commerce and Labor was organized,\r\nthe civil service law applied to all appointments excepting bureau\r\nchiefs, so that I was able to devote my time to the duties of my office,\r\nfree from claims of patronage, which had been the bane of the older\r\ndepartments of the Government before the civil service law became so\r\ngenerally operative.\r\n\r\nMy wife had so promptly put our household in order that in a week after\r\nour arrival, we were comfortably installed in our Washington home, No.\r\n2600 Sixteenth Street, a house known as the \"Venetian Palace\" from the\r\nstyle of its architecture. It was a new house, built by Mrs. John B.\r\nHenderson, and well suited to our needs and for entertaining. The social\r\nfunctions in Washington I found most agreeable. During the season we\r\neither gave a dinner or attended a dinner on an average of five evenings\r\na week, but these occasions were not burdensome because they usually\r\nended by ten-thirty o'clock.\r\n\r\nAccording to custom, President Roosevelt at the beginning of the season\r\ndesignated the date on which each Cabinet member was to give a dinner to\r\nthe President, and the date assigned to me was February 19th. It had\r\nbeen usual for each host to invite to this dinner all the other Cabinet\r\nmembers and their wives, which left little opportunity to invite others.\r\nRoosevelt changed this custom so that other friends of the host were\r\ninvited rather than one's fellow members in the Cabinet. Foreign\r\ndiplomats also were not invited, the entire purpose being to give these\r\noccasions the character of intimate gatherings, not large, usually from\r\neighteen to twenty-five guests.\r\n\r\nOur dinner went pleasantly. The President was in his usual good humor.\r\nWines were served liberally, but it was Roosevelt's habit to drink very\r\nlittle. This I had observed on several previous occasions, both at the\r\nWhite House and elsewhere. Roosevelt usually took some white wine with\r\napollinaris, and perhaps a glass of champagne. For this dinner my wife\r\nhad secured the additional services of a certain colored cook in\r\nWashington, a woman famous for preparing terrapin, which was one of\r\nRoosevelt's favorite dishes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTuesday and Friday mornings, beginning at eleven o'clock, were the\r\nregular days for the meetings of the Cabinet, then as now. The day after\r\ntaking office, therefore, I attended my first meeting, taking the chair\r\nassigned to me. It was labeled on the back \"Secretary of Commerce and\r\nLabor, December 17, 1906.\"\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet table is oblong, the President seated at the head, and to\r\nhis right and his left the secretaries in the order in which their\r\ndepartments were created--Secretary of State first to the President's\r\nright, Secretary of the Treasury first to the left, and so on. Being\r\nhead of the ninth and youngest Department, my seat was at the foot of\r\nthe table, opposite the President.\r\n\r\nThe meetings were informal and no minutes were taken or other record\r\nmade. After some brief preliminary talk, in which the President often\r\nhad some incident to relate or some amusing caricature or savage attack\r\nupon himself to exhibit, the business of the day began. The President\r\ncalls on every secretary, but in no fixed order. He presents such\r\nmatters as he may deem important, and upon which he may want discussion\r\nand advice.\r\n\r\nAt this meeting I intended not to bring up anything, preferring to wait,\r\nas the saying is, until I got \"warm in my seat.\" But an important matter\r\nhad come up that very morning upon which I had made a decision, based on\r\nthe carefully reasoned opinion by the solicitor of the department, Mr.\r\nCharles Earl. The State of South Carolina, under one of its recent laws,\r\nhad authorized its State Commissioner of Immigration to go to Europe and\r\nselect a number of skilled factory hands for the industrial\r\nestablishments of the State. There were about four hundred and fifty of\r\nthese immigrants, and there was some question about admitting them. The\r\nImmigration Law of 1903, as well as previous laws, excepted the State\r\nfrom its contract labor clauses, and I therefore decided upon their\r\nadmission.\r\n\r\nIndeed, no subject in the department occupied my daily attention to the\r\nextent that immigration did. Fortunately, at the chief port of entry,\r\nEllis Island in the New York Bay, there was a capable, conscientious,\r\nefficient commissioner, Robert Watchorn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Copyright by Clinedinst_\r\n\r\nTHE ROOSEVELT CABINET\r\n\r\nLeft to right: The President, Root, Straus, Garfield, Metcalf,\r\nCortelyou, Taft, Meyer, Wilson, Bonaparte]\r\n\r\nThe right of the immigrant to land, after his medical examination, was\r\nbased upon the decision of a board of inquiry. This board often made\r\nhurried and ill-considered decisions, especially when the immigration\r\nwas large. In the case of exclusion, the immigrant has the right to\r\nappeal to the Secretary of the Department of Commerce and Labor. Of\r\ncourse, cases coming under certain portions of the exclusion provisions,\r\nsuch as contract labor, mental deficiency, affliction with loathsome and\r\ncontagious diseases, were easily enough disposed of; but under the\r\nprovision \"Likely to become a public charge\" there was room for the\r\npersonal attitude of the members of the board, and the fate of the\r\nimmigrant then depended on whether or not these men were\r\nrestrictionists. I felt that there was a domestic tragedy involved in\r\nevery one of these cases, and as the law placed the ultimate decision\r\nupon the Secretary, I decided this responsibility was one that should\r\nnot be delegated; so day by day I took up these decisions myself,\r\nfrequently taking the papers home with me and carefully reviewing them\r\nbefore retiring.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nImportant among the immigration subjects were those which presented\r\nphases of the Japanese question, the immigration _en masse_ of Japanese\r\nto the Pacific Coast States, California in particular. The question was\r\nbrought up by Secretary Root at one of the Cabinet meetings. The city of\r\nSan Francisco had taken action excluding Japanese from the public\r\nschools. It was deemed detrimental for the white children of tender ages\r\nto be in the same classes with older and even adult Japanese who came to\r\nthese schools to learn English. My predecessor, who was a resident of\r\nCalifornia, had investigated and was conversant with all aspects of the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nThe President insisted that, as it directly affected the relations\r\nbetween the two nations, it was a national concern. Several members of\r\nthe Cabinet also regarded the subject as one having serious\r\nprobabilities. Secretary Root asked me whether I could furnish some data\r\nas to the use made of Hawaii by Japanese immigrants for circumventing\r\nour contract labor law, as many of the Japanese immigrants were coming\r\nto the mainland via Hawaii. Upon looking into this question I found\r\nduring the year previous fully two thirds of the Japanese came via\r\nHawaii. The President took the situation in hand and had the mayor of\r\nSan Francisco and other leaders of the Japanese agitation come to\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nThe obnoxious matter was finally adjusted with Japan in a manner to\r\nallay irritation by a \"Gentlemen's Agreement,\" by which that country\r\nitself was to prevent the emigration of its laboring classes. It was, of\r\ncourse, much better that the Japanese interdict emigration of their own\r\npeople than that we offend that nation's pride by preventing their\r\nentrance, although it was made clear that we should pass an exclusion\r\nlaw if they did not take prompt and effective action.\r\n\r\nWith some exceptions, this plan worked well. The whole Japanese\r\nquestion, however, was still smouldering. A few months later, during a\r\ncall at the Department, the Japanese ambassador mentioned to me that in\r\nsome parts of the Pacific Coast the Japanese were being molested in the\r\nstreets and that, of course, such things made bad blood and stirred up\r\nthe people in Japan, with which I had to agree. I admitted that this was\r\nan outrage, stating that I was sure our respective governments would do\r\nall in their power to maintain good relations, to which he replied that\r\nhe did not see how those good relations could be disturbed.\r\n\r\nAmbassador Aoki then referred to the naturalization of his countrymen in\r\nthe United States. I told him that on that question I agreed entirely\r\nwith the President, who in one of his recent speeches had dwelt\r\nemphatically on it, advocating laws for the naturalization of Japanese\r\nthe same as accorded to other aliens. He then mentioned the Executive\r\nOrder of the President with reference to Japanese immigration and the\r\nregulations for the enforcement of it. I told him I had these\r\nregulations in hand and he could rely upon me to make them so as to\r\navoid every possible friction and reflect in every way the broad and\r\nliberal spirit of the administration; also that under the immigration\r\nact the matter was to a large extent in the control of Japan in issuing\r\nlimited passports to the special classes affected, namely, skilled and\r\nunskilled labor.\r\n\r\nAfter one of the Cabinet meetings I had a conversation with Secretary\r\nRoot and submitted to him redrafted regulations for any suggestion or\r\namendment that might appear to him desirable, for I was anxious that the\r\nSecretary of State should give the regulations critical examination, in\r\nview of their affecting our relations with Japan. He returned them to me\r\nwithin a few days with one or two slight changes, which I adopted, and\r\nout of them grew the \"limited passports\" provision of the Immigration\r\nAct of 1907.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time I brought up the Japanese situation and emphasized\r\nthat I regarded it in a most serious light. Meanwhile, whenever the\r\nopportunity presented itself I did whatever was possible to promote\r\ngood-will between the two countries. Japan's great military chief,\r\nGeneral Tamemoto Kuroki, paid a visit to the United States, and was\r\ngiven a gala dinner at the Hotel Astor in New York, following ovations\r\nto him all the way across the continent from the time he landed at San\r\nFrancisco. There were over a thousand guests. Admiral Dewey was\r\npresiding officer; John H. Finley was toastmaster, and it was felt he\r\nwas particularly chosen, being president of the College of the City of\r\nNew York, because of the protest this would imply against the exclusion\r\nof Japanese children from the San Francisco public schools. I was\r\ninvited to deliver an address, in which I said:\r\n\r\n     The Government and people of Japan, not unmindful of the good-will\r\n     and early friendship of our country, are too wise to permit the San\r\n     Francisco school incident, which was fostered by ignorance and\r\n     propagated by injustice, to cloud their just appreciation of the\r\n     enlightened spirit of American institutions.\r\n\r\nCaptain Tanaka, of General Kuroki's staff, had handed me in translation\r\na message that the General had prepared for the American people, which I\r\nread in the course of my address. It was as follows:\r\n\r\n     The Japanese people love peace. They fought for peace. My nation\r\n     wants peace in which to develop the opportunities that are hers. We\r\n     have no other desire.\r\n\r\n     The profession which I have the misfortune to follow is noble only\r\n     because sometimes it is necessary to establish conditions in which\r\n     peace may be maintained and in which the arts of peace may\r\n     flourish.\r\n\r\nTo this I added that nobler sentiments never fell from the lips of a\r\nconquering hero, and they would stand beside those uttered by our hero\r\nof the Appomattox: \"Let us have peace.\" This was received with much\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\nEarly in June, 1907, there was another outbreak in San Francisco against\r\nthe restaurant keepers, and telegrams from Tokyo told of the irritation\r\nthis caused among the people in Japan. At the Cabinet meeting I took the\r\nsubject up again with considerable emphasis. I pointed out that these\r\nincidents were accumulating and were bristling with grave consequences;\r\nthat Japan had come into the front rank among nations and could not\r\nafford to permit us or any other nation to slap her, as it were, in the\r\nface, or to treat her even in small things as a nation of inferior race.\r\nI brought up the subject of Japanese naturalization. As the law stood,\r\na Japanese could not be naturalized, according to the rulings of one or\r\ntwo judges of the United States courts; but the subject had never been\r\nfinally decided. A short time previous to this a Japanese seaman in\r\nFlorida had filed a petition for naturalization which was granted, and I\r\nreferred the matter to the Attorney-General to see whether that would\r\nnot afford an incident wherewith to test the law. But no action was\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\nAt first the President did not seem to attach to the subject the\r\nimportance that I did, but Secretary Root immediately spoke up that he\r\nagreed with my view of it, and as the discussion went along, the rest of\r\nthe Cabinet, as well as the President, gradually came over to my view.\r\nAt the end the President remarked: \"I am very glad you brought up that\r\nsubject.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the discussion I reviewed the whole legal aspect of the matter,\r\nand referred to the fact that the several decisions made had been based\r\non Chinese precedents. I also touched on the ethnological aspect, that\r\nit was doubtful whether the Japanese could be classed as Mongolians.\r\nThis phase appealed to Roosevelt, who seemed well informed in\r\nethnological studies. I felt rather gratified with this thorough\r\ndiscussion of the subject. It had interested me for years, and I had\r\nbeen ruminating on it for several weeks.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the last Cabinet meeting before the vacation season, each member\r\nreferred to his plans for the summer. I had decided to combine business\r\nwith pleasure by taking a trip along the Canadian border from Montreal\r\nto Vancouver to inspect the lighthouse and immigration services, then\r\ndown the Pacific Coast and to Hawaii, where I might acquaint myself with\r\nregard to immigration as it affected the Japanese question. The\r\nPresident thought this would be a useful trip and urged me to take it.\r\n\r\nIn the administration of a department such as that of Commerce and\r\nLabor, it was important to familiarize one's self as much as possible\r\nwith its outlying branches, to become personally acquainted with the\r\nvarious officers and the details of their work and surroundings, thereby\r\nto enable one better to do the administrative work than by remaining at\r\none's desk.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Vancouver we stopped a few days each at Seattle, Portland,\r\nand San Francisco, where I conferred with the officials of the\r\nDepartment. From San Francisco we took a steamer to Hawaii, on board\r\nwhich we met George R. Carter, Governor of Hawaii, returning from a\r\nvacation in the United States, and Congressman and Mrs. Nicholas\r\nLongworth. It made a very pleasant party.\r\n\r\nThe authorities and the population gave us a rousing welcome, cannons\r\nsaluted, and the militia was out to escort us. Only once before since\r\nthe island became United States territory had a Cabinet official paid a\r\nvisit, and that was two years before when Secretary of War Taft stopped\r\nthere for a few days _en route_ to Japan. We were comfortably installed\r\nin the Hotel Moana, in the suburb of Waikiki.\r\n\r\nThe islanders showered upon us bounteous hospitality in every\r\nconceivable form. We participated in rounds of dinners and receptions.\r\nGovernor and Mrs. Carter entertained the Longworths and us in the\r\nofficial residence, the former palace of the Hawaiian rulers, in the\r\nthrone room of which hung the portraits of those rulers from earliest\r\ntimes to the deposed Queen Liliuokalani. The reception was a brilliant\r\noccasion. The leading officials and the _elite_ of the population were\r\nthere; the grounds were beautifully illuminated; and the Royal Hawaiian\r\nBand played the soft, plaintive music so typical of the mild\r\ntemperament of the people and the luxuriant foliage of the island. My\r\ntime was much taken up with official and semi-official duties. The\r\nisland residents impressed me with the great need for better shipping\r\nfacilities between the mainland and the islands. The coastwise shipping\r\nlaws applying to them since annexation penalized the carrying of\r\npassengers or freight in other than American bottoms. Foreign ships\r\naccepting either passengers or freight to American ports on the coast\r\nwere heavily fined. The result was, not only inconvenience to residents\r\nwho for one reason or another needed to leave the islands, but the loss\r\nof much perishable freight, principally fruit, which rotted on the\r\nwharves waiting for American ships. I promised them that I would do\r\neverything in my power to help them get the shipping facilities they\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\nA delegation of Japanese editors, representing the four Japanese\r\nnewspapers of Honolulu, called to ascertain my views regarding Japanese\r\nmatters in the islands, what my policy was with regard to Japanese\r\nimmigration, and whether I believed that the preponderance of Japanese\r\npeople in Hawaii was inimical to the interests of the territory. I\r\nanswered them:\r\n\r\n     An ideal condition for the future welfare of these islands would be\r\n     that there should not be too great a preponderance of any one race,\r\n     but that an equilibrium be maintained.\r\n\r\n     I would impress upon you, and upon each of the several races here,\r\n     to have a care not to exploit these islands and their resources for\r\n     the benefit of the country from which they come, but to act in the\r\n     spirit of loyalty to the government under which they live; of\r\n     loyalty to the interests of the islands which afford such happy and\r\n     ideal homes for them and their children. I am gratified that the\r\n     public school system has such a great influence upon the young, who\r\n     grow up with the American ideals and respect for the liberty of the\r\n     individual. I would like to see an increasing number of Americans\r\n     from the mainland come and settle in these islands, if for no other\r\n     reason than to guarantee for all time to come the continuance of\r\n     the American spirit for the benefit and welfare of all peoples who\r\n     have made and will make their homes here.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the time at my disposal did not permit my visiting the\r\nvarious islands. We did, however, see everything to be seen at Oahu, the\r\nisland upon which Honolulu is situated. Rear-Admiral Very took us on the\r\nU.S.S. Iroquois to visit Pearl Harbor, the famous landlocked bay large\r\nenough to shelter the battle fleets of several nations. We also visited\r\nthe Waialua pineapple plantation and cannery, where twenty thousand cans\r\nof the large, luscious fruit were put up daily. The processes of paring,\r\ncoring, slicing, and canning were done by machinery with great speed,\r\nand we enjoyed tasting the fruit as much as any school children might.\r\n\r\nIn Honolulu I met Viscount Ishii, who was then Japanese under-Secretary\r\nof State. He has since been ambassador at Washington and at this writing\r\nis ambassador at Paris. We had frequent conferences and went over the\r\nwhole Japanese question. He had fully informed himself upon all phases\r\nof the subject, as well as regarding the idiosyncrasies of the Pacific\r\nCoast States in opposing the immigration of Japanese laborers. Ishii's\r\nthorough understanding of the situation at that time did much to smooth\r\nruffled feelings in Japan. The Viscount returned to the States on the\r\nsteamer with us.\r\n\r\nAs we sailed out of the harbor on the Asia, bedecked with Hawaiian\r\nflowers, the Royal Hawaiian Band played its farewell music. The last\r\nwords we heard from the Hawaiian shore were \"Aloha Nui,\" the Hawaiian\r\nfarewell.\r\n\r\nI had satisfied myself that, so far as concerned the carrying out of\r\nthe President's Executive Order of March 14, 1907, the Japanese\r\nofficials in both Hawaii and Japan were doing everything in their power.\r\nHawaii at the time had a population of about 160,000, in round figures,\r\nof which about 80,000 were Japanese, 20,000 Chinese, and 25,000 native\r\nHawaiians. Of the white element the biggest percentage were Portuguese,\r\nwho numbered about 22,000, while all other Caucasians together,\r\nprincipally American, British, and German, numbered 14,000. It therefore\r\nbehooved our officials on the islands, in the Pacific ports, and along\r\nthe Mexican border, to be especially watchful to carry out the\r\nregulations which the Department had formulated with regard to the\r\nadmission of Japanese or Korean skilled and unskilled labor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSoon after my return I had a conference with the President at Oyster\r\nBay. The President informed me that Secretary Taft was about to leave\r\nfor Japan, to go from there to Russia by the Siberian Railroad. He said\r\nhe had authorized him to see what could be done toward overcoming the\r\ndifficulties in our relations, and what might be the effect in Japan if\r\nwe were to endeavor to pass a law giving naturalization to Japanese\r\nexclusive of the laboring classes and the small traders who practically\r\nbelonged to the same class. This subject the President had urged in his\r\nlast Message to Congress.\r\n\r\nOn October 25th I brought up in the Cabinet meeting, for the information\r\nof the President, statistics regarding Japanese immigration up to\r\nOctober 1, 1907, which showed that the immigration for the twelve months\r\nthen ended was almost double that of the preceding twelve months, and\r\nalso that there had been an appreciable increase since April 1, when the\r\nPresident's Executive Order went into effect, compared with the\r\nprevious months. The statistics regarding the transit of Japanese\r\nbetween Mexico and Canada showed that something like six hundred and\r\nseventy registered from April to September, but only about one third\r\nthat number actually made the transits. It was presumed, therefore, that\r\nthe rest got off within United States territory.\r\n\r\nThe President seemed very much annoyed with this condition of things. I\r\nrecalled to his mind that when the regulations under his Executive Order\r\nwere originally presented by me, they contained a clause, along the\r\nlines of the Chinese regulation on the subject, to prevent the abuse of\r\ntransit privileges, but that he and the Cabinet had decided it to be\r\nunwise to put in that clause. A few months thereafter, when we first\r\nsuspected the abuse of transit privileges, I directed an accurate\r\naccount to be taken of these transits, the result of which I now\r\npresented.\r\n\r\nThe first impulse of the President was to direct that all transit be\r\ndenied, but I pointed out that that would raise considerable objection,\r\nas it would place the Japanese in a special class in that respect. He\r\ninsisted that something must be done. I suggested that the problem\r\nneeded careful thought and I would take it up and prepare regulations\r\nsimilar to those for the Chinese. This I did, and the Japanese\r\nregulations differ only in that we do not require the photographing of\r\nthe person to make the transit.\r\n\r\nI did not propose to drop the matter of Japanese immigration and\r\nnaturalization. Again and again I brought it up in Cabinet meetings. I\r\nbelieved the best way of adjusting the difficulties was to try to\r\nnegotiate a treaty with Japan permitting the naturalization of Japanese\r\nother than laboring classes, and in return excluding all who came within\r\nthe category of skilled or unskilled labor. The belief that such a\r\ntreaty could be negotiated was confirmed by my talks with Ishii both at\r\nHonolulu and later when he visited Washington. The right to\r\nnaturalization would be taken advantage of by only five or six thousand\r\nand would not, of course, be granted to the laborers then resident in\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nThere were about seventy-three thousand Japanese in the United States,\r\nand it was fair to assume that two thirds of these were of the laboring\r\nclass. Of the remainder there was a small percentage of women and\r\nchildren, and then there were those born in America. Japanese eligible\r\nfor citizenship would therefore not exceed ten or twelve thousand, and\r\nit was reasonable to assume that not more than half of them would be\r\nwilling to throw off their native allegiance. My belief was that such an\r\nadjustment of the problem would leave no irritation behind it.\r\n\r\nThe President did not think such a treaty would be confirmed by the\r\nSenate, and to have it rejected would make matters worse. Secretary\r\nMetcalf thought the California members would not agree to such an\r\narrangement. Notwithstanding these objections I was of the opinion that\r\nsuch force of argument could be found in favor of the arrangement that\r\neven representatives from California would not fail to see its\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nThe whole question simmered along for a year or more, during which our\r\nunderstanding with Japan in regard to the \"Gentlemen's Agreement\" and\r\nthe regulations under it were put into concrete and final shape; that\r\nis, a letter was written by the Japanese ambassador to our Secretary of\r\nState setting forth the understanding of Japan, to which the Secretary\r\nreplied accepting that understanding and setting forth the amicable\r\nrelations existing between the two countries.\r\n\r\nIn late January, 1909, there was a recrudescence of anti-Japanese\r\nlegislation in California. There were introduced in the State\r\nlegislature three bills: (a) to exclude Japanese from ownership of land;\r\n(b) to segregate the Japanese in special districts of the city; (c) to\r\nprohibit Japanese from attending the public schools. With his usual good\r\njudgment the President telegraphed the Governor of California saying he\r\nwas writing him and asking that he withhold any legislation affecting\r\nthe Japanese until the receipt of that letter. For the time being this\r\naction had the desired effect.\r\n\r\nThe legislature of California was somewhat under the influence of\r\nagitators, like the Japanese and Korean Restriction League and some\r\nlabor bodies. It was believed that the general sentiment of California\r\nwas against such legislation, but either to avoid conflict, or from\r\nindifference or lack of public spirit, such sentiment did not make its\r\ninfluence felt. I had given out figures from month to month showing the\r\nnumber of immigrants from Japan as compared with previous figures. I\r\nthen made public statistics which showed that for the calendar year 1907\r\nthe number of immigrants was 12,400, whereas for the calendar year 1908,\r\nafter the Japanese Government had taken the matter in hand in accordance\r\nwith the \"Gentlemen's Agreement,\" the number of immigrants was 4400.\r\nDeducting the figure for the emigration from that 4400 left a total\r\nincrease of Japanese population of only 185 for the year. The California\r\nagitators claimed my figures were erroneous, and that hordes of Japanese\r\nwere surreptitiously coming from the Canadian and Mexican borders. I\r\ngave out several interviews to the press to the effect that the figures\r\nwere absolutely correct; that it was absurd to deny their correctness as\r\nI had proofs in my hands; and that if the Californians still doubted\r\nthem a committee might call on me and I should gladly lay my proofs\r\nbefore them. I had sent a copy of these figures, certified by me, to the\r\nCalifornia authorities.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHappily our relations with Japan are now more peaceful than they have\r\nbeen for some time, and to a large degree this has been accomplished by\r\nthe Four Power Treaty negotiated at the Washington Conference on the\r\nLimitation of Armaments in December, 1921. The various vexatious\r\ninstances that I have referred to were stimulated by German officers\r\nstationed in the Far East and fostered by the sensational press in both\r\nJapan and our own country. By this means these happenings were\r\nexaggerated far beyond their significance. The Anglo-Japanese Alliance\r\nof 1911 came into being because of the aggression of Germany and Russia\r\nin the Far East. After the World War, of course, this condition no\r\nlonger obtained, and as the _raison d'etre_ of the alliance had\r\ntherefore vanished, there was a justified feeling in America that the\r\ncontinuance of the treaty was a menace to our country. This fact was not\r\nunrecognized in Great Britain itself. As Mr. Balfour stated at the\r\nWashington Conference, it was necessary to \"annul, merge, destroy, as it\r\nwere, this ancient and outward and unnecessary agreement, and replace it\r\nby something new, something effective, which should embrace all the\r\npowers concerned in the vast area of the Pacific.\" By the Four Power\r\nTreaty the Anglo-Japanese Alliance was automatically discontinued, and\r\nGreat Britain, the United States, France, and Japan became associated in\r\nfriendly partnership as guardians of the peace in the Far East.\r\n\r\nSo far as concerns the relationship between our country and Japan, the\r\ntranscendent importance of this treaty has been to supersede and\r\novershadow all these minor matters that before were continually\r\nmenacing our good relations. By the reservations prepared by the\r\nAmerican delegates, and accepted by the other powers, it is provided\r\nthat the treaty \"shall not be taken to embrace questions which according\r\nto principles of international law lie exclusively within the domestic\r\njurisdiction of the respective powers.\" Verily this treaty stands out as\r\none of the great achievements of the Washington Conference.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo return to immigration problems during my incumbency as Secretary of\r\nthe Department of Commerce and Labor, a minor though nevertheless\r\nannoying matter needing adjustment was the regulation with regard to the\r\nhead tax. After the passage of the Immigration Law of 1903 a head tax of\r\ntwo dollars was levied upon all alien passengers, including even\r\nofficials of foreign governments. In 1905 Attorney-General Moody had\r\ngiven an opinion to the effect that the tax applied to all alien\r\npassengers, whether officers of foreign governments or not. I thought\r\nthis contrary to the law of nations and to well-established diplomatic\r\nusages recognized throughout the world.\r\n\r\nAs the subject also came within the province of another department,\r\nnamely, the Department of State, I naturally brought it up at a Cabinet\r\nmeeting. The President recommended that I issue orders in accordance\r\nwith my suggestion, and Secretary Root agreed that it was an outrage to\r\nlevy such a tax upon the representatives of foreign governments.\r\nInformally I took the matter up with Attorney-General Bonaparte, but as\r\nthe decision against this immunity had been made by his Department he\r\nfelt himself bound by the decision of his predecessor. He suggested that\r\nI issue the order on my own responsibility, but I decided for the time\r\nbeing not to do so. At a later Cabinet meeting I again brought up the\r\nmatter, this time reading the order as I proposed it. The President and\r\nSecretary Root, also Secretary Taft, agreed that it should be issued,\r\nand this I did.\r\n\r\nAt the same time I discussed a provision of the Immigration Act of 1906\r\nrequiring masters of all vessels bringing in aliens, without exception,\r\nto fill out a blank or manifest giving the age, sex, calling,\r\nnationality, race, of each alien, and whether able to read or write, and\r\nwhether anarchist or not. These blanks then had to be signed by the\r\naliens. I prepared two circulars, one ordering the discontinuance of the\r\nhead tax and the other discontinuing the filling out of these blanks so\r\nfar as concerned diplomatic or consular officials and other persons duly\r\naccredited from foreign governments to the United States, in service or\r\nin transit.\r\n\r\nAt dinner at the British ambassador's home some weeks thereafter Lady\r\nBryce mentioned having to sign a blank asking whether she believed in\r\nthe practice of polygamy. Of course, she brought it up in a humorous\r\nway, but it was apparent that she had felt humiliated at such\r\nquestioning. I told her I fully appreciated her feelings and was happy\r\nto be able to say that that stupid practice had been discontinued.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe subject of naturalization had occupied my attention for years past.\r\nUnder the law then existing, as well as under older laws, a person could\r\nbe naturalized not only in the United States courts, but in any State\r\ncourt having a seal. And the naturalization laws prior to the Act of\r\n1906 were most carelessly administered. In the larger cities of many of\r\nthe States naturalization applications were hurried through in bunches\r\nat the direction of some political boss. In that way many persons were\r\nnaturalized who would have been found, had time been taken to sift the\r\napplications, not entitled to citizenship. The effects of so careless a\r\nmethod I saw in Turkey, and in my dispatches to the State Department I\r\nrepeatedly pointed out the evil.\r\n\r\nLargely growing out of my presentation of the subject, Mr. Gaillard\r\nHunt, chief of the passport division of the State Department, had taken\r\nit up in his thorough manner and made a report to President McKinley,\r\nupon which the President appointed a commission to study the subject.\r\nThe commission was renewed by President Roosevelt. Its report, known as\r\nHouse Document 326, 59th Congress, 2d Session, and entitled \"Citizenship\r\nof the United States, Expatriation, and Protection Abroad,\" was the\r\nbasis of the Act of 1906. This act went far in preventing fraudulent\r\nnaturalization as well as in withdrawing protection from those who were\r\nusing United States citizenship not with the intention of becoming part\r\nof the new country in which they had chosen to reside, but as a means to\r\nescape their duties as subjects of the country of their origin upon\r\nreturning there to live, as had happened so often in Turkey.\r\n\r\nFor the proper carrying out of this law additional examiners were\r\nneeded, and also about eleven additional assistant district attorneys. I\r\ntherefore arranged with Attorney-General Bonaparte to appear with him\r\nbefore the Appropriations Committee of the House to explain the\r\nnecessity of an appropriation to cover the enlargement of the corps for\r\nthe enforcement and administration of the new law. During my experience\r\nabroad much of the time of our diplomatic representatives was taken up\r\nwith questions relating to the protection of our citizens, and often\r\nthis protection was invoked by persons who should never have been\r\nnaturalized.\r\n\r\nThe exclusion and deportation of criminals and anarchists was another\r\nphase of the immigration service to which I had given considerable\r\nstudy. I found the law provided for arrest and deportation of criminal\r\naliens only up to three years of the time of their landing, and that\r\nthere was gross misconception regarding the scope of the law. There was\r\nno cooperation between our immigration officials and the local police\r\ndepartments for the detection of such persons. The police departments of\r\nmost of our cities were disposed to assume that by virtue of the\r\nimmigration law the whole subject was under the jurisdiction of the\r\nFederal Government; and on the other hand our officials did not confer\r\nwith municipal officials to make use of the immigration law. It is one\r\nthing to provide for the exclusion of criminals and anarchists, but it\r\nis quite another to discover, on entry, whether a person belongs to\r\neither class. They are usually neither illiterate nor lacking in cunning\r\nand deception, but within three years they may be detected, as \"birds of\r\na feather flock together.\"\r\n\r\nI decided to issue a circular to all commissioners of immigration and\r\nimmigration inspectors, with a view to bringing about cooperation with\r\nthe local officials. I took the subject up in the Cabinet and the\r\nPresident approved. It so happened that while this circular was being\r\nprepared, an Italian immigrant, recently arrived, killed a Catholic\r\npriest in Denver while the latter was officiating at a mass in his\r\nchurch, and a day or two thereafter another recently arrived immigrant,\r\na Russian, attacked the chief of police of Chicago and his family with a\r\ndagger. Both of these men would have come under the deportation\r\nprovisions of the immigration law had the police been aware of these\r\nprovisions, as in both instances they had been suspected, by their\r\naffiliations and their talk, of being anarchists, as that term is\r\ndefined in the Immigration Act of February 20, 1907. Under the local\r\ncriminal laws this suspicion was not enough to justify arrest.\r\n\r\nAppearing as it did immediately after these two incidents my circular\r\nhad much publicity and brought about the deportation of a number of\r\nundesirables upon evidence supplied by the police and detective\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn a Department which covered so many and such varied subjects, the\r\nconflict between human and property interests was often apparent. I\r\nrecall a remark by the President, as we were speaking about this, that\r\nwhenever within my jurisdiction there occurred this conflict he was sure\r\nI would lean on the human side, and I could always count on his support.\r\n\r\nA striking example of this conflict grew out of an order I issued for\r\nthe inspection of excursion and ferry boats at least three times a year\r\ninstead of once. The summer before I took office the boiler of the\r\nGeneral Slocum, a large excursion boat on the Long Island Sound, blew up\r\nand caused the death of over a hundred women and children. As spring\r\napproached and the excursion season drew near, I made up my mind that I\r\nshould make all possible provision to prevent the recurrence of any such\r\ndisaster.\r\n\r\nI accompanied the supervising inspector-general, George Uhler, to\r\nwitness the inspection of some passenger boats plying between Washington\r\nand Norfolk, to get personal knowledge of the details of inspection. I\r\ncarefully studied a report made to me by Mr. Murray, the assistant\r\nsecretary of my Department, who had been a member of the board of\r\ninquiry into the Slocum disaster and later the Valencia wreck. I called\r\na meeting of the board of supervising inspectors of steamboats and\r\nimpressed upon them the importance of great care in inspection. I urged\r\nthat no man be retained in the inspection service who was not thoroughly\r\ncompetent and efficient, since they had to deal with the protection of\r\nhuman life.\r\n\r\nMy order for more frequent inspection brought forth many objections from\r\nthe steamboat owners, and, as is usual in such cases, a committee came\r\nto Washington and presented their grievances and objections direct to\r\nthe President, in the hope of inducing him to overrule my instructions.\r\nThey were patiently heard, but their main objection was that it would\r\ncost a little more and be a little more inconvenient to have three\r\ninspections instead of one, and the President gave them little more\r\ncomfort than to make it quite clear that he was thoroughly in accord\r\nwith my action for the provision of greater safety to human life. He\r\ntold them he felt he was fortunate in having at the head of the\r\nDepartment of Commerce and Labor a man who was a humanitarian besides\r\nhaving large business experience, for while it was his purpose to\r\nharmonize human and business interests, always when they conflicted he\r\nwould lean toward the human side, as I had done in issuing that order.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe President was deeply interested always in the natural resources of\r\nthe country and their preservation, and asked me to take up the question\r\nof the Alaska salmon fisheries. It was certain that unless some drastic\r\naction was taken, the salmon would be destroyed in the Alaskan waters\r\njust as they had been in the Columbia River. Roosevelt was familiar with\r\nthe problem and believed that Wood River ought to be closed. I devoted\r\nparts of two days to a hearing on the subject. The cannery interests\r\nwere represented by their counsel and the Fishermen's Union by several\r\nof its officers. Senator Fulton, of Oregon, as well as the two Alaskan\r\ndelegates in Congress, pleaded for the closing of the rivers.\r\n\r\nAfter hearing all sides and studying the question I signed an order\r\ndirecting the closing of both the Wood and Nushagak Rivers to trap and\r\nnet fishing, and if the law had permitted, I should have directed the\r\nclosing also of Nushagak Bay, where extensive trap fishing was carried\r\non.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen I was president of the New York Board of Trade and Transportation I\r\nwas impressed with the importance of establishing a closer relationship\r\nbetween the commercial bodies of the country and the Government. Shortly\r\nafter I became Secretary of Commerce and Labor, therefore, I sought to\r\naccomplish that end. I had a study made by Nahum I. Stone, tariff expert\r\nof the Bureau of Manufactures, of the relations between the European\r\ngovernments and their commercial bodies, especially in such countries as\r\nGreat Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Belgium. I sent invitations\r\nto about forty of the leading chambers of commerce, boards of trade, and\r\nother commercial organizations throughout the country to send delegates\r\nto Washington for a two days' conference, with a view to bringing about\r\nan organization of these bodies for the purpose of cooperation between\r\nthem and the departments of the Government having to do with commerce\r\nand manufactures.\r\n\r\nAccordingly on December 5th a representative gathering of over one\r\nhundred delegates met in my Department, and I put before them a plan for\r\norganization. I invited Secretary Root, who took a deep interest in the\r\nscheme, and he made a thoughtful address, in which he impressed upon the\r\ngathering the things that ought to be done, and could be done only\r\nthrough organization and the power of concerted effort. Andrew D. White,\r\nour experienced ambassador at Berlin, had sent to the President a letter\r\ncontaining the proposal that a method of instruction in commerce be\r\napplied at the instance of our Government as had been done in\r\nagriculture; this interesting proposal I read to the meeting.\r\n\r\nI then went with the delegates in a body to the White House where the\r\nPresident addressed them. In the afternoon Gustav H. Schwab, of the New\r\nYork Chamber of Commerce, was elected temporary chairman and the\r\norganization of the council proceeded. A committee on organization and a\r\ncommittee on rules were appointed, and it was decided that an advisory\r\ncommittee of fifteen members was to have headquarters in Washington. The\r\nnumber of meetings to be held per year was fixed, as well as the annual\r\ndues. On December 5, 1907, the National Council of Commerce came into\r\nbeing.\r\n\r\nA year later the first annual meeting was held in my Department. The\r\nCouncil now had permanent offices in the Adams Building, with William R.\r\nCorwine in charge. In my address to the delegates I stressed the\r\nimportance of the development of our commercial relations with the South\r\nAmerican republics, particularly in view of the rapidly approaching\r\ncompletion of the Panama Canal. At that time we had only twenty-three\r\nper cent of the foreign trade of South America, and one of the main\r\nrequirements for increasing our share was the establishment of better\r\nshipping and postal facilities. To that end I recommended in my annual\r\nreport that the Postal Subsidy Act of 1891 be extended to include ships\r\nof sixteen knots and over, and my colleagues, the Secretary of State and\r\nthe Attorney-General, made similar recommendations.\r\n\r\nA month after the change of Administration the executive committee of\r\nthe Council held a meeting, again in the Department of Commerce and\r\nLabor, at which they passed the following resolution:\r\n\r\n     Resolved, by the members of the Executive Committee of the National\r\n     Council of Commerce in meeting assembled in the office of the Hon.\r\n     Charles Nagel, the present Secretary of Commerce and Labor, That\r\n     they tender their heartiest thanks to the Hon. Oscar S. Straus, the\r\n     former Secretary of Commerce and Labor, for his constant and\r\n     well-directed efforts in forming and promoting the National Council\r\n     of Commerce, expressing their appreciation of his far-sightedness,\r\n     his patriotism, his energy, his fairness, and his friendship,\r\n     assuring him of the high personal esteem in which he is held by all\r\n     of them, and asserting that in their judgment he has laid the\r\n     foundation for a movement which will redound not only to his credit\r\n     as a Cabinet officer, but one which will ultimately be productive\r\n     of incalculable benefit to the business interests of our country,\r\n     the development of which he has so deeply at heart.\r\n\r\nLater that year the Council was reorganized and called the Chamber of\r\nCommerce of the United States, which to-day is an important institution\r\nin the commercial life of our country.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo bring about a similar relationship between the Department and the\r\nlabor bodies, I called another conference in February, 1909, to which I\r\ninvited the leading labor representatives throughout the country, and\r\nabout fifty attended. Unfortunately my term of office was drawing to an\r\nend and there was not time to organize this wing, but I urged the men to\r\ninsist upon the continuance of the conferences and the cooperation with\r\nthe Department thus established.\r\n\r\nThe matters discussed at this meeting were mainly how best to lessen\r\nunemployment, how the Division of Information under the Bureau of\r\nImmigration might be administered for the greater benefit of labor in\r\ngeneral, and how the Nobel Peace Prize, which President Roosevelt had\r\nset aside for a foundation for the promotion of industrial peace, could\r\nbe made most effective. There were addresses by Samuel Gompers,\r\npresident of the American Federation of Labor; Warren S. Stone, grand\r\nchief of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers; William F. Yates,\r\npresident of the Marine Engineers' Beneficial Association; and Terence\r\nV. Powderly, chief of the Division of Information in the Bureau of\r\nImmigration. The presiding officer was Daniel J. Keefe,\r\nCommissioner-General of Immigration and Naturalization.\r\n\r\nDuring my term of office repeated efforts were made in Congress, backed\r\nby organized labor, to divide my Department and make two of it--the\r\nDepartment of Commerce and the Department of Labor. I successfully\r\nopposed this plan, my idea being that labor and capital were the two\r\narms of industry, the proper functioning of which could best be secured\r\nby cooperation, which in turn could best be promoted by administering\r\ntheir interests together. In this I had the support of President\r\nRoosevelt. During the Taft Administration, however, the bill was passed\r\ncreating the Department of Labor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have mentioned Roosevelt's Nobel Peace Prize. As received by the\r\nPresident, it consisted of a medal and diploma, and a draft for\r\n$36,734.79. He decided not to keep the money, but to turn it over in\r\ntrust for a foundation for the promotion of industrial peace. In\r\nJanuary, 1907, he called me to the White House and told me that he would\r\nforward the draft and the papers to Chief Justice Fuller, with the\r\nrequest that he communicate with the other trustees, of whom there were\r\nfour: James Wilson, Secretary of Agriculture; John Mitchell, president\r\nof the Anthracite Coal Operators; ex-Mayor Seth Low, of New York, and\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nLater the Chief Justice came to my Department with the papers to go over\r\nthem with me and to arrange for their safe-keeping until we could have a\r\nmeeting and formulate a plan of action. Subsequently he informed me that\r\nbefore preparing the draft of the act granting the foundation it was\r\nnecessary to write a preamble setting forth its objects and purposes,\r\nand this he found it difficult to do. I relieved his mind by offering to\r\nprepare the bill with the preamble. I consulted with Dr. Cyrus Adler, of\r\nthe Smithsonian Institution, who had had considerable experience in\r\ndrafting documents for the creation of trusts of this nature. With his\r\nassistance I prepared the draft of the preamble and the bill, which the\r\nChief Justice approved. I then took them to the President, who also\r\napproved them and requested me to call a meeting of the trustees, of\r\nwhom there were to be nine instead of five as originally.\r\n\r\nAt the meeting of January 27, 1907, a few slight changes were made and\r\nadopted in the bill. Thus redrafted, with a report attached giving a\r\nhistory of the award, it was introduced in the House by Congressman\r\nRichard Bartholdt, of Missouri, member of the Committee on Labor; and in\r\nthe Senate by John W. Daniel, of Virginia. It was promptly passed. The\r\nboard of trustees as finally constituted included: Archbishop Ireland,\r\nSamuel Gompers, Daniel J. Keefe, Seth Low, Marcus M. Marks, Dr. Neill,\r\nWarren S. Stone, James Wilson, and myself.\r\n\r\nThe foundation was in existence for about ten years, and in that time\r\nthe interest on the money merely accumulated, because the trustees were\r\nunable to find a proper means for employing it. In July, 1917, Mr.\r\nRoosevelt requested Congress to repeal the bill and return the money to\r\nhim, that he might distribute it among the different charitable\r\nsocieties in the United States and in Europe which were affording relief\r\nto the sufferers from the war. The request was granted, and the sum with\r\nits accrued interest, amounting to $45,482.83, was thus distributed by\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nRoosevelt always encouraged the members of his Cabinet to make speeches\r\nin various parts of the country on subjects uppermost in the mind of the\r\npublic, with due regard, of course, to the duties of office. I accepted\r\na number of the many such invitations that came to me. At the banquet of\r\nthe National Association of Manufacturers, held in the Waldorf Hotel,\r\nNew York, in May, 1907, I was asked to be the principal speaker. I made\r\ncareful preparation of an address, part of which I devoted to advocating\r\na moderate tariff reform, with a view to providing a maximum and minimum\r\ntariff to meet discrimination against us by some European nations. I\r\nconsulted with the President about it. While he agreed with my premises,\r\nhe thought the time not ripe to project that issue, so I redrafted my\r\nspeech and devoted it to such topics as the development of our\r\nmanufactures, the work of the Bureau of Corporations, and the relations\r\nof employers and workers.\r\n\r\nOn April 3, 1908, the Savannah Board of Trade celebrated its\r\ntwenty-fifth anniversary, and I was asked to be one of the speakers. Two\r\nothers were Governor Hoke Smith and Representative J. Hampton Moore,\r\npresident of the Atlantic Deep Waterways Commission. It was a special\r\noccasion and was widely advertised for several weeks. I prepared an\r\naddress in which I outlined also some of the activities carried on by my\r\nDepartment for the benefit of the commercial interests of the country.\r\nOn this trip my wife and younger daughter accompanied me. During our\r\nstay at Savannah we were the guests of the Board of Trade, who showed us\r\nevery possible attention, in true Southern fashion, and we thoroughly\r\nenjoyed our stay.\r\n\r\nThe Mayor and prominent citizens of my former home, Columbus, upon\r\nlearning of our presence in the South, sent us a pressing invitation to\r\nvisit that city. A committee met us at the station, and in the evening a\r\ndinner was given at the Opera House, at which about a hundred of the\r\nleading citizens were present. The dinner was served on the stage, and\r\nwhile the toasts were being responded to, the curtain was raised,\r\ndisclosing an auditorium crowded with people. I was quite touched by\r\nthis fine attention by the citizens of my former home, who took great\r\npride in the fact that one of their former townsmen was a member of the\r\nCabinet. In the audience were several of my schoolboy friends and those\r\nof my brothers, and I found several friends and companions of my parents\r\nstill among the living.\r\n\r\nIn the South at that time it was still rare for a person to change his\r\npolitics, and one of the questions that was put to me was why had I, a\r\nmember of a Democratic family, once a Democrat myself, and even having\r\nheld office under a Democratic President, changed over to the Republican\r\nside. In other words, why had I been on both sides of the political\r\nfence, though they were too polite to ask the question in that direct\r\nform. I told them that perhaps no one had a better right than they to\r\nask the reason for my political affiliations. It was true, I said, that\r\nI had been, as it were, on both sides of the fence, but that was not my\r\nfault; the fence had been moved. This produced great merriment and\r\napplause.\r\n\r\nTalbotton, the first American home of my family, also extended an\r\ninvitation to us, which I accepted with pleasure. A dinner and reception\r\nwere given in my honor at the public hall known as the Opera House, at\r\nwhich the Mayor of the town made an address, as well as several other\r\nprominent citizens. While in Talbotton we were the guests of the\r\nHonorable Henry Persons, former member of Congress and an old friend of\r\nour family. He gave me my first rubber ball, when I was six years old. I\r\nvisited all the scenes of my boyhood; it was forty-five years since I\r\nhad lived there. The population of the town was about the same, equally\r\ndivided between the whites and the blacks. The little Baptist church\r\nwhere I went to Sunday school was much smaller than it had loomed up in\r\nmy imagination. Collinsworth Institute was abandoned, and only the\r\nrecitation hall was left standing. The several houses wherein my family\r\nhad lived brought back vivid memories of the toils and pleasures of my\r\nparents. The little frame cottage with the green blinds especially\r\nimpressed upon me how little is required for happiness where there is\r\nthe love and contentment which always blessed our family. All who\r\nremembered my father and mother spoke of them in the highest terms. I\r\nmet a number of my boyhood friends, grown gray and old. On the whole the\r\nlittle town had not changed much, though it had fewer signs of\r\nprosperity. Before the Civil War it was the center of a rich\r\nslave-holding county. The people, however, seemed contented and happy.\r\n\r\nFrom Talbotton we went to Atlanta, and then made one or two more stops\r\non the way home. At each place we met friends of former years and were\r\ngiven a thoroughly royal welcome. In fact, the reception given us\r\nthroughout the whole tour was in the nature of an ovation. Wherever we\r\nstopped our rooms were decorated with an abundance of the most\r\nbeautiful flowers. The Southerners have ever been known for their\r\nhospitality, and in this respect the New South has lost nothing.\r\n\r\nLater in the year the Southern Commercial Congress, representing ten\r\nStates, assembled in Washington, and I was asked to preside at the\r\nopening session in the large ballroom of the New Willard Hotel. There\r\nwere three or four hundred people present. I devoted my address to a\r\ncomparison between the old agricultural South and the new industrial\r\nSouth, pointing out that as the economic interests of the South were no\r\nlonger sectional but national, it must follow that politically there is\r\nno longer a reason for \"the solid South.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn leaving the Cabinet one day at about this time the President's\r\nyoungest son, Quentin, came up to me. I had a great affection for this\r\nbright, attractive boy. He was eleven years old, and he informed me he\r\nweighed one hundred and fourteen pounds. He was full of animal spirits,\r\nfrank, charming. \"You gave my brother Kermit some coins,\" he said to me.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; are you interested in them?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"I am making a little collection,\" was his answer.\r\n\r\nI invited him into my carriage and to come to lunch with me. He accepted\r\nreadily, and I reminded him that he had better let his mother know. He\r\ndid so by hurriedly running into the White House and returning in a very\r\nfew minutes saying his mother said he might go. He behaved like a\r\nperfect little gentleman and showed that under his sparkling vivacity\r\nthere was serious, intelligent hunger for knowledge. After lunch I took\r\nhim into my library and showed him my collection of Greek and Roman\r\ncoins. I told him he might pick out what he liked. To the several he\r\nchose I added a gold stater of Philip. He was overjoyed. From that time\r\nonward we became still greater friends, and he came to see me whenever\r\nhe got a new coin for his collection.\r\n\r\nIn 1909, when I was going through Paris, I met him there with his\r\nmother. During this visit he and I were quite steadily together. We\r\nvisited the museums and other places of interest. I found him a most\r\nsympathetic and delightful companion, notwithstanding the immense\r\ndifference in our ages. What a record of glory and patriotism this\r\nlovable boy has left to his country! And with what fortitude his parents\r\nbore their most painful loss! Their example strengthened the anguished\r\nhearts of many patriotic fathers and mothers of the land who suffered\r\nlike affliction.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn Christmas Day Mrs. Straus and I received an invitation by telephone\r\nto come to the White House between three and four o'clock to see the\r\nChristmas tree. Some thirty or forty guests were there, mainly friends\r\nof the family. In one of the side rooms in the basement of the house was\r\nassembled a large company of children. The room was darkened, that the\r\nlighted tree might stand out. There were presents for all the children,\r\nand Mrs. Roosevelt played Lady Bountiful to see that each child got its\r\ngift. Upstairs in the Red Room the gentlemen sat smoking. It was a\r\ngenuinely joyful and memorable day.\r\n\r\nThe social season in Washington is usually begun with the President's\r\nNew Year's reception, which lasts from eleven o'clock until half-past\r\ntwo on New Year's Day. At a few minutes before eleven o'clock the\r\nofficials and their wives assembled upstairs, and promptly at eleven the\r\nPresident and Mrs. Roosevelt led the march to the Blue Room. The\r\nprocession advanced toward the main stairway, where the line divided,\r\nthe ladies going to the left and the gentlemen to the right, reuniting\r\nat the first landing; then through the main hall where the passageway\r\nwas roped off through a crowd of specially invited guests.\r\n\r\nThe order following the President was: the Cabinet officers; the doyen\r\nof the diplomatic corps, the Italian ambassador and his staff; the\r\nambassadors and ministers of the other nations, according to rank. After\r\nthem, grouped in more or less regular order, the justices of the Supreme\r\nCourt, headed by the Chief Justice; Senators; Representatives; Army and\r\nNavy officials; the officers of the Government.\r\n\r\nOn New Year's Day every one is accorded the right to pay his or her\r\nrespects to the President. The officials come straight to the White\r\nHouse and the uninvited guests form a line on the grounds. On the\r\nparticular day of which I speak the line stretched through the grounds,\r\nalong Pennsylvania Avenue and down by the State Department Building,\r\nprobably more than half a mile long, and the President received about\r\nsixty-five hundred people in all. At two o'clock the iron gates of the\r\nWhite House grounds were closed, and those who had not reached that\r\npoint by that time were barred out. The reception had to end promptly,\r\nas the Cabinet ladies who assisted had to be present at the receptions\r\nat their own homes from half-past two until six, in accordance with a\r\ncustom that has been in vogue probably since the days of Washington. Our\r\nbuffet in the dining-room was kept well replenished, and there were\r\nchampagne and punch served. We had in all about four hundred guests.\r\n\r\nThe official functions at the White House during the Roosevelt\r\nAdministration were agreeable and in stately form. They were usually\r\nfollowed by an informal supper to which were invited personal friends\r\nand visitors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MRS. OSCAR S. STRAUS]\r\n\r\nOur series of official dinners began with the one to the\r\nVice-President and Mrs. Fairbanks and ended with the dinner to the\r\nPresident and Mrs. Roosevelt. In addition we followed the pleasant\r\ncustom of the President and had guests to informal luncheons three or\r\nfour times a week. These luncheons we gave in the sun parlor back of our\r\ndining-room, which was one of the attractive features of our Venetian\r\npalace.\r\n\r\nIt was my privilege to give the last Cabinet dinner to the President, on\r\nMarch 2d, two days before the close of the Administration. The event had\r\nbeen postponed for a week on account of the death of the President's\r\nnephew, Stewart Robinson, whose mother was the President's sister.\r\nGovernor and Mrs. Hughes, who were among our invited guests, stayed over\r\nwhen it was found that the dinner had to be postponed. Mrs. Roosevelt\r\nlater informed me that she planned that our dinner be the last, knowing\r\nthat I had some sentiment about it which she and the President shared.\r\n\r\nI have made several references to the wonderfully human touch\r\ncharacteristic of Roosevelt. On February 5th, the day beginning the last\r\nmonth of his Administration, a messenger from the White House brought me\r\na package containing a large folio, a handsomely illustrated memorial\r\nvolume describing the Castle of Wartburg in Saxony, in which Luther was\r\nconfined and where he worked on his translation of the Bible. The book\r\nhad been prepared by official direction, and Roosevelt had received two\r\ncopies of the royal edition, one from the Kaiser personally and one from\r\nthe Chancellor, which latter he sent to me with this inscription:\r\n\r\n\"To Mr. and Mrs. Oscar S. Straus, in memory of our days together in the\r\nAdministration; days which I have so much enjoyed and appreciated.\r\nTheodore Roosevelt. February 5, 1909.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE TAFT CAMPAIGN OF 1908\r\n\r\n     Roosevelt favors Taft to succeed him--I visit Taft at\r\n     Cincinnati--Roosevelt plans for his African trip--I take part in\r\n     the Taft campaign--Roosevelt's method of preparedness--Election\r\n     evening at the White House--Roosevelt rebukes a bigot; his letter\r\n     on religious liberty--Taft tells Roosevelt he will retain Wright,\r\n     Garfield, and me in his Cabinet--Roosevelt's speech at the dinner\r\n     to Vice-President-elect Sherman--Looking toward the end of my term;\r\n     the last Cabinet meeting--Closing the administration of Roosevelt\r\n     and ushering in that of Taft.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in September, 1907, in a conversation with Roosevelt at Oyster\r\nBay, we touched on matters political and the forthcoming national\r\nconvention of the Republican Party for the nomination of a President.\r\nRoosevelt had again publicly made the statement he gave out at the time\r\nof his election, that he would not accept a renomination, and had made\r\nknown his desire that the party nominate Taft.\r\n\r\nI had just returned from Hawaii, and told him that throughout my trip to\r\nand from the Pacific Coast I observed an almost universal determination\r\nto force the nomination upon him. I had met many people and addressed\r\nseveral merchants' organizations and other bodies, and again and again\r\nthe sentiment of prominent Republicans was: \"We know Roosevelt is\r\nsincere in his statement that he would decline the nomination, but what\r\ncan he do if he is renominated? He is a patriotic man, and how can he\r\nrefuse to obey the unanimous wish of his party and the people at large?\"\r\nThe President knew of this strong sentiment for him, and that was one of\r\nthe main reasons why he made the public and definite statement that he\r\nfavored the nomination of Taft, whom he regarded as best qualified to\r\ncarry forward the measures and policies of his Administration.\r\n\r\nSome of Roosevelt's closest friends counseled him not in any way to\r\ninterfere with the selection of his successor. He practically agreed to\r\nthat, but in order to escape the nomination himself he felt compelled to\r\nthrow his influence toward Taft. I think it was Secretary Root at the\r\ntime who remarked that it would be impossible for Roosevelt to let the\r\ntail of the tiger go without some such plan. Notwithstanding his\r\npositive statements that he would not accept a renomination at the end\r\nof his term, and his constant reiteration of this determination, the\r\npressure throughout the country was overwhelming.\r\n\r\nThe people naturally resent the selection of a candidate for them by the\r\nPresident in office, and in the past have shown their resentment by the\r\ndefeat of such candidates. But the conditions surrounding the Taft\r\ncampaign were somewhat different. Roosevelt was committed heart and soul\r\nto the moral principles for which his Administration had stood in face\r\nof the mighty opposition of the \"interests.\" How the force and might of\r\nthis opposition had grown until Roosevelt took up the \"big stick\" can\r\nperhaps hardly be measured except by those who were with him in the\r\nbitter fight. No one was more conversant with the principles and\r\npolicies of the Administration than Taft, and, all things considered,\r\nperhaps none better qualified than he to carry them forward in a firm\r\nand constructive way.\r\n\r\nThe logic of the situation was, of course, that Roosevelt stand again\r\nfor the Presidency, especially as that would not in reality have been a\r\nthird term. But he would not under any circumstances recede from the\r\ndecision announced on the night of his election. It required great\r\nfirmness not to be swept off his feet by the tremendous pressure to\r\ninduce him to consent to be renominated. In the face of these facts the\r\npeople were less inclined to resent his indicating his preference for\r\nthe successor whom he regarded as best qualified to carry forward the\r\npolicies he had inaugurated by such reforms as the rebate law against\r\nrailroads, the anti-trust laws, and child labor legislation, and other\r\nprogressive measures.\r\n\r\nAt the Cabinet meeting just before the summer vacation Taft came in\r\nradiantly happy. He had been nominated the day before; it had been\r\nunderstood for some time that he would be nominated on the first ballot.\r\nReflecting at the time upon the qualifications of Mr. Taft as a\r\nsuccessor to Roosevelt, I put down among my random notes that I thought\r\nhe possessed the very qualifications for constructively carrying forward\r\nthe principles Roosevelt had stood for, and which only Roosevelt could\r\nhave so courageously vitalized. Taft always appeared to be jovial and\r\nkept, at least outwardly, a genially good-natured equilibrium. He\r\npossessed to a marked degree a fund of spontaneous laughter--a valuable\r\nasset in the armor of a public man. The power to create a good laugh has\r\nat times not only the elements of argument, but of avoiding argument;\r\nwith it a man can either accede to a proposition or avoid acceding; it\r\ncan be committal or non-committal; it conceals as well as expresses\r\nfeelings, and acts as a wonderful charm in avoiding sharp and rugged\r\ncorners, in postponing issues and getting time for reflection. In the\r\npractice of the law I was once associated with a very able man who had\r\nthe ability to laugh his opponent out of court. And his was a jeering\r\nlaugh where Taft's laugh was contagious and good-natured. Not that he\r\nlacked the ability at times to be fearless and outspoken; he had shown\r\nhimself to be that in a number of speeches prior to his nomination.\r\n\r\nWithal I could not help feeling sad that Roosevelt's plan had so well\r\nsucceeded, and in an intimate chat with the President after the Cabinet\r\nmeeting I told him so. He would not have been human if, amid the\r\nsatisfaction he felt in having his choice for the Presidency respected,\r\nthere was not some feeling of regret in stepping down from the greatest\r\noffice in the world, which he had administered with so much satisfaction\r\nand success, and the duties and responsibilities of which he had enjoyed\r\nmore than perhaps any one of his predecessors. To use his own words as I\r\nso frequently heard them: \"I have had a bully time and enjoyed every\r\nhour of my Presidency.\" Another four years in office would doubtless\r\nhave prolonged that enjoyment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEarly in September I went to Cincinnati to meet Taft at his headquarters\r\nin the Hotel Sinton, and Terence V. Powderly, head of the Information\r\nDivision of the Bureau of Immigration, formerly president of the Knights\r\nof Labor, accompanied me. I brought to Taft's attention some\r\ncorrespondence that had been conducted by Louis Marshall, of New York,\r\nwith Charles P. Taft, his brother, and with the candidate for\r\nVice-President on his ticket, Sherman, regarding some narrow and\r\nprejudiced editorials on Russian immigration appearing in the Cincinnati\r\n\"Times-Star,\" owned by Charles P. Taft. I pointed out that not only were\r\nthese editorials untrue and unjust, but they did not reflect his policy\r\nand yet were so interpreted. Secretary Taft then asked the editor of the\r\npaper, Mr. Joseph Garretson, and his nephew, Hulbert Taft, to call on\r\nme. With them I went over the whole subject, and upon my return to\r\nWashington young Mr. Taft sent me a double-column article from the front\r\npage of the \"Times-Star,\" together with a double-column editorial,\r\nforcefully and clearly written, embracing the whole matter as we had\r\ncovered it during my visit to Cincinnati.\r\n\r\nSamuel Gompers had come out strongly in favor of Bryan, and no one could\r\ntell what effect that might have on the great labor element of the\r\ncountry. Mr. Powderly, who was very broad-minded and independent in his\r\npolitics, said it would have little if any effect on the labor vote, as\r\nit is not a group vote, and no leader, however powerful, can make it so.\r\nThis statement later proved to be entirely correct. The Democrats among\r\nthe labor men went their way, and the Republicans went theirs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet met again after the summer vacation on September 25th. The\r\nPresident wanted to talk with me afterward about several matters, so I\r\nwaited and sat with him while he was being shaved. He spoke about the\r\narrangements he had made for his African trip, and said several\r\ntaxidermists of the Smithsonian Institution were to accompany him. I\r\ntold him that Dr. Adler of the Institution had spoken to me of the\r\nmatter, and my particular concern was that one of the men in his party\r\non this African expedition should be a physician. He assented, saying\r\nthat after all he was fifty years old and ought to be more careful about\r\nhis health than when he was younger. He seemed to know that I had had\r\nsomething to do with enabling the Smithsonian Institution to supply\r\nthese men, but I did not let it appear that I knew much about it. When\r\nhis book \"African Game Trails\" appeared he sent me a copy with the\r\ninscription:\r\n\r\n                      To Oscar Straus\r\n                      from his friend\r\n\r\n                          THEODORE ROOSEVELT\r\n\r\n                Nov. 1^{st} 1910.\r\n\r\nIn the Appendix he makes acknowledgment to several of his friends\r\nincluding myself, \"to all of whom lovers of natural history are\r\ntherefore deeply indebted.\"\r\n\r\nHe mentioned that he had had an invitation to give a lecture at Oxford\r\nUniversity upon his return, which he felt like accepting because it was\r\na course in which some of the most prominent men of the past, including\r\nGladstone, had lectured, and it appealed to him to speak at this ancient\r\nuniversity. I encouraged him to do so. He said he did not intend,\r\nhowever, to accept invitations to other European countries, because he\r\ndid not wish to be feted. This lecture would be more in line with his\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the request of Roosevelt and the urgent solicitation of Taft, I took\r\nan active part in the campaign, making scores of speeches in the leading\r\ncities of the East and Middle West. I made the first on September 26th,\r\nthe day after the first Cabinet meeting of the season, under the\r\nauspices of the Interstate Republican League, in Washington. It was one\r\nof the largest political meetings ever held there. I addressed myself to\r\na recent speech by ex-Secretary of State Olney, in which he had endorsed\r\nBryan. I pointed out how much more had been done under the Roosevelt\r\nAdministration than by the Democratic Administration with which Mr.\r\nOlney was connected, in bringing suits against the trusts under the\r\nSherman law; that in Mr. Olney's time nearly all such suits were brought\r\nagainst labor combinations, while in Roosevelt's time they were brought\r\nagainst the offending corporations.\r\n\r\nI had been in close touch with Roosevelt during his own campaign four\r\nyears before, but I must say he threw himself with greater energy into\r\nTaft's campaign, watching every phase of it with great care and\r\ncircumspection to counteract every unfavorable tendency and to push\r\npromptly every tactical advantage. On Sunday afternoon, September 27th,\r\nI received a telephone message to come to the White House. When I\r\narrived I found present Secretaries Cortelyou and Meyer, Lawrence F.\r\nAbbott, of \"The Outlook,\" and William Loeb. Roosevelt was dictating a\r\nletter to Bryan, in answer to the latter's attack upon the\r\nAdministration's policies, and invited each of us to make suggestions.\r\nThose that seemed good he immediately incorporated. I had brought with\r\nme some facts and figures that I prepared for campaign use, and all of\r\nthis material he embodied. When the dictation was finished, he asked us\r\nto return at nine o'clock in the evening to go over the finished\r\nproduct, as it was important that the letter be given to the press for\r\nnext morning's papers.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived in the evening, the President was already at his desk\r\ncorrecting the typewritten pages, of which there were about twenty. The\r\nduplicates were handed to us, and we passed them from one to another for\r\nreading and suggestions. At one point I suggested changing an expression\r\nto a more dignified form, which the President vetoed with the\r\ncharacteristic remark: \"You must remember this letter is not an etching,\r\nbut a poster.\" That was an apt illustration of his purpose, namely, to\r\nattract and fix popular attention; and I withdrew my suggestion.\r\n\r\nThe published letter occupied three and a half newspaper columns. It was\r\npowerful and effective and nailed some of the main fallacies that Bryan\r\nhad been expounding. This was the third such letter by Roosevelt, and\r\nsome people were inclined to criticize them as having the appearance of\r\novershadowing Taft and other campaign orators. This might have been true\r\nto an extent, but it was of little consequence in comparison with the\r\ntremendous effect of the letters in enlightening the people with regard\r\nto the greater national principles for which Taft stood.\r\n\r\nThe following week I started on a campaign tour. I made speeches at\r\nBaltimore, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Chicago. In accepting the pressing\r\ninvitation of the National Republican Committee to make a series of\r\nspeeches, I made one condition, which was that I would not speak at any\r\nmeeting gotten up on sectarian or hyphenated political lines. It was,\r\nand I regret to say still is, customary, in political campaigns,\r\nespecially among local managers in smaller cities with large\r\nforeign-born populations, to appeal to their former national sympathies.\r\nI regarded this method as un-American and inimical to the solidarity of\r\nour Americanism. My letter to the chairman of the speakers' bureau,\r\nSenator Joseph M. Dixon, was by him given to the press and widely\r\npublished. It had a very good effect, and through that campaign at least\r\nput an end to advertising and meetings based on race or creed appeal.\r\nUpon my return to New York I spoke at a number of meetings in Brooklyn\r\nand New York with Mr. Taft, the last and largest of these being the one\r\nat Madison Square Garden, at which General Horace Porter presided.\r\nCharles E. Hughes, who was candidate for Governor, also spoke on that\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe President and Mrs. Roosevelt invited Mrs. Straus and me to return to\r\nWashington with them in their private car on election day, after we had\r\nvoted in our respective districts. _En route_ the President again\r\nmentioned the arrangements for his African trip and told me he had also\r\naccepted an invitation to speak at the Sorbonne, Paris. He was already\r\npreparing his Oxford address, the draft of which when ready he wanted\r\nme to read. It is generally believed that Roosevelt did things hurriedly\r\nand impulsively. But those of us who were acquainted with his methods\r\nknew the contrary to be true. Preparedness was one of his outstanding\r\ncharacteristics. He was a most industrious worker, and as soon as he\r\nmade up his mind to do something, whether it was to deliver an address\r\nor to bring forward some reform, he set to work at once making\r\npreparations, so as not to leave it until the time for the event was at\r\nhand. In the case of his Oxford and Sorbonne addresses, for instance, he\r\nprepared them long in advance and gave himself plenty of time to correct\r\nand polish them. He told me he pursued this method because it freed his\r\nmind and enabled him to be ready for the next thing to come before him.\r\nThat is certainly not the way an impulsive man works.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nElection evening in Washington we were invited to the White House to\r\nreceive the returns. The twenty-five or thirty other officials who were\r\nin the city were also there with their wives. The returns began to come\r\nin shortly after eight o'clock and were being tabulated by Secretary\r\nLoeb and his assistants. It was soon evident that Taft was elected, so\r\nthat by eleven-thirty we were able to send congratulations to the\r\nsuccessful candidate and Frank H. Hitchcock, chairman of the National\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\nThe greatest strength of Taft proved to be what many supposed would be\r\nhis weakness, namely, that he was the choice of Roosevelt and stood for\r\nhis principles. The masses had understood the President and appreciated\r\nhis policies, though the big interests, the \"ledger patriots,\" had been\r\ntoo blinded by their selfish objects to recognize the permanent value of\r\nthe principles and policies of America's greatest reformer.\r\n\r\nI felt convinced then, as I do now, that the Roosevelt Administration\r\nwill go down in history as marking the beginning of a new era in our\r\nhistory--an era marking the end of aggression upon our political\r\nstructure by corporate greed and the beginning of larger opportunities\r\nfor the individual, in which the moral principles of our public life\r\nwere rescued from the danger of domination by an unprecedented onrush of\r\ncommercial power.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the first Cabinet meeting after the election Roosevelt was buoyant as\r\nusual. He made a few preliminary remarks about the approaching end of\r\nthe Administration: he and his Cabinet, especially the last one, had\r\nworked in perfect harmony, and he felt sure we had all had a \"bully\"\r\ntime of it; he would retire at the end of his term without any regrets,\r\nfor he had the satisfaction of knowing that he and his Cabinet had done\r\nall in their power for the greatest good of the Nation. I think it is\r\nsafe to say we all felt a little sad, I know I did, to think that in\r\nfour months we should separate, and that we should lose the inspiring\r\ncompanionship and guidance of our leader, to whom each of us felt tied\r\nby bonds of warm friendship and a sense of profound esteem and highest\r\nrespect, personally as well as officially.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me then that it required no prophet's vision to see that,\r\nif Roosevelt kept his health, in four or eight years the people of the\r\ncountry would again demand, with unmistakable and overwhelming voice,\r\nthat he become President. At the end of eight years, even, he would be\r\nonly fifty-eight, younger than most Presidents at the time of assuming\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nThe President now brought up a question that he had been carrying over\r\nfrom the campaign period. He had received several letters regarding the\r\nreligion of Mr. Taft. Some orthodox ministerial organizations had\r\nendeavored to use the fact that Mr. Taft was a Unitarian as a reason for\r\nprejudicing people against him. Roosevelt had been tempted to answer\r\nthese letters, but when he presented the matter to the Cabinet it was\r\nthe general consensus of opinion that he should not do so, that the\r\nissue intimately concerned Taft, and information regarding it had better\r\nbe given out or withheld at Taft's discretion. To this the President\r\nagreed, but he was incensed at this un-American attempt to bring\r\nreligion into politics, especially as Taft was every bit as good a\r\nChristian as Washington, and a better one than either Jefferson or\r\nFranklin; and his church was the same as that of Adams and Webster.\r\n\r\nThe election being over, Roosevelt was still desirous of expressing his\r\nviews in this matter, and he brought with him to the Cabinet meeting the\r\ndraft of a letter to be sent to one J. C. Martin, of Dayton, Ohio, who\r\nhad asked for a public statement concerning the faith of Mr. Taft. As\r\nusual, he invited criticism and discussion. Several of us made\r\nsuggestions, and Secretary Root made one which the President asked him\r\nto write out so that he might incorporate it. When the corrected version\r\nof the letter was read, we all agreed that it was a remarkable document\r\nfor effectively rebuking the spirit of bigotry and upholding the basic\r\nprinciples of the American Government, and that it should therefore be\r\npublished. It appeared in the papers of the country three days later.\r\n\r\nI made bold to ask the President for the draft of this letter, which he\r\ngladly signed and gave to me, and Secretary Root also signed his\r\npenciled insert. As I consider this document worthy of a permanent place\r\namong American annals, I herewith set it forth from the original in my\r\npossession:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                THE WHITE HOUSE\r\n                                        WASHINGTON, _November 4, 1908_\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR SIR:\r\n\r\n     I have received your letter running in part as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"While it is claimed almost universally that religion should not\r\n     enter into politics, yet there is no denying that it does, and the\r\n     mass of the voters that are not Catholics will not support a man\r\n     for any office, especially for President of the United States, who\r\n     is a Roman Catholic.\r\n\r\n     \"Since Taft has been nominated for President by the Republican\r\n     party, it is being circulated and is constantly urged as a reason\r\n     for not voting for Taft that he is an infidel (Unitarian) and his\r\n     wife and brother Roman Catholics.... If his feelings are in\r\n     sympathy with the Roman Catholic church on account of his wife and\r\n     brother being Catholics, that would be objectionable to a\r\n     sufficient number of voters to defeat him. On the other hand if he\r\n     is an infidel, that would be sure to mean defeat.... I am writing\r\n     this letter for the sole purpose of giving Mr. Taft an opportunity\r\n     to let the world know what his religious belief is.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     I received many such letters as yours during the campaign,\r\n     expressing dissatisfaction with Mr. Taft on religious grounds; some\r\n     of them on the ground that he was a Unitarian, and others on the\r\n     ground that he was suspected to be in sympathy with Catholics. I\r\n     did not answer any of these letters during the campaign because I\r\n     regarded it as an outrage even to agitate such a question as a\r\n     man's religious convictions, with the purpose of influencing a\r\n     political election. But now that the campaign is over, when there\r\n     is opportunity for men calmly to consider whither such propositions\r\n     as those you make in your letter would lead, I wish to invite them\r\n     to consider them, and I have selected your letter to answer because\r\n     you advance both the objections commonly urged against Mr. Taft,\r\n     namely: that he is a Unitarian, and also that he is suspected of\r\n     improper sympathy with the Catholics.\r\n\r\n     You ask that Mr. Taft shall \"let the world know what his religious\r\n     belief is.\" This is purely his own private concern; it is a matter\r\n     between him and his Maker, a matter for his own conscience; and to\r\n     require it to be made public under penalty of political\r\n     discrimination is to negative the first principles of our\r\n     Government, which guarantee complete religious liberty, and the\r\n     right to each man to act in religious [affairs] as his own\r\n     conscience dictates. Mr. Taft never asked my advice in the matter,\r\n     but if he had asked it, I should have emphatically advised him\r\n     against thus stating publicly his religious belief. The demand for\r\n     a statement of a candidate's religious belief can have no meaning\r\n     except that there may be discrimination for or against him because\r\n     of that belief. Discrimination against the holder of one faith\r\n     means retaliatory discrimination against men of other faiths. The\r\n     inevitable result of entering upon such a practice would be an\r\n     abandonment of our real freedom of conscience and a reversion to\r\n     the dreadful conditions of religious dissensions which in so many\r\n     lands have proved fatal to true liberty, to true religion, and to\r\n     all advance in civilization.\r\n\r\n     To discriminate against a thoroly upright citizen because he\r\n     belongs to some particular church, or because, like Abraham\r\n     Lincoln, he has not avowed his allegiance to any church, is an\r\n     outrage against that liberty of conscience which is one of the\r\n     foundations of American life. You are entitled to know whether a\r\n     man seeking your suffrages is a man of clean and upright life,\r\n     honorable in all his dealings with his fellows, and fit by\r\n     qualification and purpose to do well in the great office for which\r\n     he is a candidate; but you are not entitled to know matters which\r\n     lie purely between himself and his Maker. If it is proper or\r\n     legitimate to oppose a man for being a Unitarian, as was John\r\n     Quincy Adams, for instance, as is the Rev. Edward Everett Hale, at\r\n     the present moment Chaplain of the Senate, and an American of whose\r\n     life all good Americans are proud--then it would be equally proper\r\n     to support or oppose a man because of his views on justification by\r\n     faith, or the method of administering the sacrament, or the gospel\r\n     of salvation by works. If you once enter on such a career there is\r\n     absolutely no limit at which you can legitimately stop.\r\n\r\n     So much for your objections to Mr. Taft because he is a Unitarian.\r\n     Now, for your objections to him because you think his wife and\r\n     brother to be Roman Catholics. As it happens they are not; but if\r\n     they were, or if he were a Roman Catholic himself, it ought not to\r\n     affect in the slightest degree any man's supporting him for the\r\n     position of President. You say that \"the mass of the voters that\r\n     are not Catholics will not support a man for any office, especially\r\n     for President of the United States, who is a Roman Catholic.\" I\r\n     believe that when you say this you foully slander your fellow\r\n     countrymen. I do not for one moment believe that the mass of our\r\n     fellow citizens or that any considerable number of our fellow\r\n     citizens can be influenced by such narrow bigotry as to refuse to\r\n     vote for any thoroly upright and fit man because he happens to have\r\n     a particular religious creed. Such a consideration should never be\r\n     treated as a reason for either supporting or opposing a candidate\r\n     for political office. Are you aware that there are several States\r\n     in this Union where the majority of the people are now Catholics? I\r\n     should reprobate in the severest terms the Catholics who in those\r\n     States (or in any other States) refused to vote for the most fit\r\n     man because he happened to be a Protestant; and my condemnation\r\n     would be exactly as severe for Protestants who, under reversed\r\n     circumstances, refused to vote for a Catholic. In public life I am\r\n     happy to say that I have known many men who were elected, and\r\n     constantly reelected, to office in districts where the great\r\n     majority of their constituents were of a different religious\r\n     belief. I know Catholics who have for many years represented\r\n     constituencies mainly Protestant, and Protestants who have for many\r\n     years represented constituencies mainly Catholic; and among the\r\n     Congressmen whom I knew particularly well was one man of Jewish\r\n     faith who represented a district in which there were hardly any\r\n     Jews at all. All of these men by their very existence in political\r\n     life refute the slander you have uttered against your fellow\r\n     Americans.\r\n\r\n     I believe that this Republic will endure for many centuries. If so\r\n     there will doubtless be among its Presidents Protestants and\r\n     Catholics, and very probably at some time Jews. I have consistently\r\n     tried while President to act in relation to my fellow Americans of\r\n     Catholic faith as I hope that any future President who happens to\r\n     be a Catholic will act towards his fellow Americans of Protestant\r\n     faith. Had I followed any other course I should have felt that I\r\n     was unfit to represent the American people.\r\n\r\n     In my Cabinet at the present moment there sit side by side\r\n     Catholic and Protestant, Christian and Jew, each man chosen because\r\n     in my belief he is peculiarly fit to exercise on behalf of all our\r\n     people the duties of the office to wich [_sic_] I have appointed\r\n     him. In no case does the man's religious belief in any way\r\n     influence his discharge of his duties, save as it makes him more\r\n     eager to act justly and uprightly in his relations to all men. The\r\n     same principles that have obtained in appointing the members of my\r\n     Cabinet, the highest officials under me, the officials to whom is\r\n     entrusted the work of carrying out all the important policies of my\r\n     administration, are the principles upon which all good Americans\r\n     should act in choosing, whether by election or appointment, the man\r\n     to fill any office from the highest to the lowest in the land.\r\n\r\n                                       Yours truly\r\n                                           THEODORE ROOSEVELT\r\n\r\nIt is amusing sometimes to contemplate the matters that occupy the\r\nattention of certain zealously inclined religious persons or groups. I\r\nrecall the flurry caused the year previous by the appearance of the new\r\nfive, ten, and twenty-dollar gold pieces without the legend, \"In God We\r\nTrust,\" which by Roosevelt's direction had been omitted. As a matter of\r\nfact that legend was not used on our coins prior to 1866, when a law was\r\npassed permitting it subject to the approval of the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury. The issuance of these coins, artistically designed by\r\nSaint-Gaudens, without the legend was merely a return to the precedents\r\nof the fathers of the Republic. I had a small collection of early coins\r\nat the time, none of which bore the legend. However, when these new\r\ncoins appeared several religious bodies passed resolutions disapproving\r\nof the President's action. Roosevelt gave out a statement to the effect\r\nthat he had always regarded that legend as connecting God and mammon,\r\nand therefore not as religious, but as sacrilegious. But the opinion\r\nagainst the omission was so strong that in subsequent coinage it was\r\nrestored. The agitation had been somewhat anticipated by the President,\r\nand he was not the least perturbed by it. At a dinner one evening he\r\nremarked to me, concerning it, that it was sometimes a good thing to\r\ngive people some unimportant subject to discuss, for it helped put\r\nthrough more important things.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter a Cabinet meeting toward the end of November, 1908, I was talking\r\nwith the President regarding various phases of the administration of my\r\nDepartment, and I mentioned one or two matters that I hoped my successor\r\nwould carry to completion. Roosevelt said to me: \"Well, I can tell you\r\none thing that Taft told me; you will be head of the Department under\r\nthe next Administration, if you will accept, and I want you to accept.\"\r\nHe had indicated this once or twice before, but had never stated it so\r\ndefinitely. I had been perfectly content to finish my term of office\r\nwith the close of the Administration, but I felt if it was the wish of\r\nboth Roosevelt and Taft that I continue I should be happy to remain.\r\n\r\nTaft had evidently intended retaining several of the Cabinet officials,\r\nbut subsequently changed his mind, which was one of the things that\r\ncaused the break between Roosevelt and him. Mr. Lawrence F. Abbott has\r\nembodied in his excellent book, \"Impressions of Theodore Roosevelt,\" an\r\narticle he contributed in January, 1912, to the Cornwall, New York,\r\nlocal press, covering the Roosevelt-Taft relations. Before publication\r\nthis article was sent to Roosevelt, and by him annotated and returned to\r\nMr. Abbott. The part regarding the retention of Cabinet members reads as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     Mr. Taft on his election no doubt wished to carry on the work of\r\n     his predecessor, and, if not publicly, often privately said that it\r\n     was his desire and intention to retain those Cabinet colleagues of\r\n     Mr. Roosevelt who had contributed so much to the re-creation of\r\n     the Republican Party. [Note by Mr. Roosevelt: \"_He told me so, and\r\n     authorized me to tell the Cabinet, specifically Garfield, Straus\r\n     and Luke Wright._\"] But this intention became gradually modified\r\n     during the winter of 1908-09.\r\n\r\nOn December 16th I attended the dinner of the Ohio Society in New York,\r\nat which President-elect Taft made his first public address. There was a\r\nnotable gathering of the leaders of finance and commerce and of the\r\nRepublican Party, and great expectancy was evident as to what Mr. Taft\r\nwould say. Ex-Senator Spooner, a brilliant speaker, also made an\r\naddress, which contained some pointed criticisms of Roosevelt policies.\r\nHe extolled the Constitution and in a veiled way indicated a deviation\r\nfrom it on the part of Roosevelt. Spooner had made other speeches along\r\nthese lines, and I confess to some exasperation that this occasion\r\nshould have been used to attack Roosevelt and his policies.\r\n\r\nTaft was the last speaker, and I hoped that when he arose he would\r\nresent these attacks, or at any rate uphold the policies of the\r\nAdministration of which he had been an important member. But I was\r\ndisappointed. He took no notice of what Spooner or one or two of the\r\nother speakers had said. To some of us this was the first evidence that\r\nthere was a rift in the relationship between Roosevelt and Taft.\r\n\r\nMr. Taft invited me to return to Washington on the train with him next\r\nmorning. _En route_ I spoke of Spooner's speech, and said it appeared to\r\nme as an attempt to drive a wedge between him (Taft) and the Roosevelt\r\npolicies, and that the attack was received by the great financiers who\r\nwere present, Harriman, Ryan, and others, with great favor. Taft said he\r\nhad observed it and did not like it. He thought first that he might say\r\nsomething in reply, but on second consideration he decided to let it\r\npass. I told him that usually I enjoyed such an occasion more when I did\r\nnot have to speak, but on that evening I very much regretted not having\r\nthe opportunity to answer that attack.\r\n\r\nWe talked of a number of things, but he said nothing about desiring to\r\nhave me continue in the Cabinet, though Roosevelt had mentioned the\r\nsubject to me several times. I then concluded that while in New York a\r\nchange of mind had come to him in this matter, and what occurred at the\r\ndinner seemed to emphasize this conclusion. He was going down to\r\nAugusta, Georgia, for a short vacation and asked me to come and see him;\r\nbut when I reached Washington there was much to be done in my\r\nDepartment, and, as he was besieged by politicians and I had nothing\r\nspecial to bring to his attention, I thought the more considerate thing\r\nwas not to take up his time needlessly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn January the New York delegation in Congress gave a dinner to\r\nVice-President-elect Sherman at the Shoreham Hotel in Washington. There\r\nwere present all the New York Congressmen, Speaker Cannon, the junior\r\nSenator from New York, Depew, and Senator-elect Root. Along about ten\r\no'clock the President arrived. As usual on such occasions, there was\r\ninformal speaking, and of course the President was called upon. His\r\noffhand remarks that evening were so inspiring that I regretted they\r\nwere not taken down that they might have been preserved. In my random\r\nnotes I have incorporated the substance of some of them; to the effect\r\nthat our highest purpose should be to perform the duties before us. He\r\nsaid he had been in public life twenty-six years (as I understood), and\r\nnearly eight years of that as President, and he had enjoyed it all;\r\nadding, humorously, \"even the scraps I have had.\"\r\n\r\nReferring to the presidential duties, it was not always possible to\r\nspell out from the words of the Constitution what those duties imposed\r\nupon the occupant of the office. He instanced the anti-Japanese outbreak\r\nin California. There was nothing in the Constitution that either\r\npermitted or conflicted with his taking the position he had in his\r\ncommunications to the Governor of California. It was his purpose to call\r\nthe attention of the people at large in that State and throughout the\r\ncountry to the dangers of the situation if the contemplated legislation\r\nwere put through. He referred to the impractical attitude of the peace\r\nsocieties and other peace advocates in objecting to all appropriations\r\nfor naval expenditures. They could render a better service by agitating\r\nto prevent a condition of international irritation that had all the\r\npossibilities of war; the good effect of the well-considered\r\n\"Gentlemen's Agreement\" with Japan had been negatived by the\r\nunreasonable legislation proposed in California.\r\n\r\nMaking reference in a general way to the work of the Administration, he\r\nsaid it was important to look to the future, but to fix one's eyes on\r\nthe future and neglect the present was as unwise as to limit one's view\r\nentirely to the present. He hoped the people would not trouble\r\nthemselves as to what to do with the ex-President; so far as he was\r\nconcerned he was able to take care of himself; upon his return from\r\nAfrica they would find him working not as an ex-President, but as a\r\nprivate citizen in the ranks, and cooperating with his party\r\nrepresentatives for the best interests of the country.\r\n\r\nHe closed by saying that what may become of one's personal reputation,\r\none's fame as an individual, is of no consequence. The individual\r\ndisappears. Oblivion will engulf us all. Only results count. In order to\r\nachieve results there must be cooperation. He was always ready to\r\ncooperate with men whose tendencies were forward, even if such\r\ncooperation led only one step forward where he would have liked ten; but\r\nhe would refuse to cooperate with men whose tendencies were backward.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn my Department I continued to push matters forward without allowing\r\nthe approaching close of the Administration to influence me. Under date\r\nof January 22d I received a letter from President-elect Taft, in answer\r\nto my inquiry, indicating that in all probability I should not be\r\nretained in the Cabinet. He said he would have written sooner, but had\r\nnot decided in what capacity he wished me to serve his Administration,\r\nthough he thought perhaps I might be willing to accept an embassy.\r\nHowever, he had not definitely decided not to retain me in the Cabinet.\r\nHe found Cabinet-making quite a difficult job.\r\n\r\nThree days later I received another note from him mentioning the embassy\r\nto Japan. He hoped to suit whatever preference I might have in the\r\nmatter after he had had a chance to talk it over with me in Washington.\r\n\r\nAt the last Cabinet meeting there was very little business transacted.\r\nThe President talked to us informally and very impressively, saying he\r\nwished to repeat, what he had said before, that a President usually\r\nreceives credit for all the good work done in his Administration, but,\r\nspeaking for himself, his co-workers had an equal share in that credit;\r\nno President, he said, had had a more effective, able, and cooperative\r\nCabinet than he. Then he added humorously that he wanted no response to\r\nmodify that statement. Some of us, however, could not resist expressing\r\nin brief the sentiments we felt, and I answered him: If we have\r\nperformed our duties to your satisfaction and to the satisfaction of the\r\ncountry, it is due in no small degree to the fact that around this table\r\nwe have caught the contagion of your fine spirit which has enabled each\r\nof us to rise to our highest level of efficiency because we felt we were\r\ncooperating in furthering those moral issues which you have vitalized in\r\nour economic and national life, I wish to add that our President in his\r\nboundless generosity has always given to each one of us not only the\r\nfullest credit for what we have done, but a recognition far beyond our\r\nindividual merits.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn March 4th, at nine-thirty in the morning, the members of the Cabinet\r\nassembled in the White House and accompanied the President to the\r\nCapitol. We went to the President's room on the Senate side and there\r\nawaited the bills to be brought in for the signature of the President.\r\nThat is usual at the closing of a session, and many bills that had been\r\npassed in the last few days came from the engrosser for the signature of\r\nthe President. Each bill was handed to the Secretary whose department it\r\naffected, and upon reading it over the Secretary advised the President\r\nwhether or not to sign it. There were three bills affecting my\r\nDepartment, two of which I approved, and those he signed. Of the third I\r\nhad no knowledge and so stated; that one the President passed to become\r\nlaw without his signature.\r\n\r\nAt eleven o'clock President-elect Taft came into the room, and we all\r\nextended our congratulations to him. Precisely at noon President\r\nRoosevelt went into the Senate Chamber and we followed. Both he and the\r\nPresident-elect took a seat before the Vice-President's desk, and we\r\nwere seated in the front row, where were also the ambassadors of the\r\nforeign powers. Vice-President Fairbanks opened the proceedings with an\r\nappropriate address, whereupon Vice-President-elect Sherman was sworn in\r\nand made a brief address. The new Senators were then sworn in in groups\r\nof four. President-elect Taft next took the oath of office, which was\r\nadministered by Chief Justice Fuller.\r\n\r\nRoosevelt then left the Senate Chamber to go to the station. In our\r\ncarriages we followed him, and at either side marched over a thousand\r\nRepublican delegates from the City of New York. One could observe on all\r\nsides evidence of a feeling of depression and regret at the departure of\r\nthe man who had endeared himself to the country at large as no President\r\nhad since the days of Lincoln. It was apparent then, as the years have\r\nproven, that he had the largest personal following ever attained by any\r\nman in this country. By personal following I mean one that is not\r\ndependent on office, but persists out of office as well. People were\r\nattracted to him because he appealed to their idealism. They had faith\r\nin him; they had an affection for him. They believed he would lead them\r\nwhere they ought to go and where, therefore, they wished to go. It was\r\nthe fact that the mass of the people throughout the land regarded him\r\nwith love and admiration as the embodiment of their ideals of\r\nAmericanism which enabled him to exercise such a tremendous power for\r\nthe welfare of the country and which is destined to enshrine his memory\r\namong the greatest men in our history.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the station, the large room reserved on special\r\noccasions for officials was closed, and only such persons admitted as\r\nwere identified by Secretary Loeb--members of the family, members of the\r\nCabinet, and a few intimate friends. When I bade the President, now\r\nex-President, good-bye, he said we should meet often and should still\r\nwork together.\r\n\r\nRoosevelt at the age of fifty was once more a private citizen, having\r\nbeen the youngest President in our history. I am sure I speak for my\r\ncolleagues as well as for myself when I say we felt we were parting not\r\nonly from our official chief, but from one of our nearest and dearest\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nWe returned in our carriages to the White House where we took buffet\r\nlunch with President and Mrs. Taft; then to the stand erected in front\r\nof the White House to witness the review.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nMY THIRD MISSION TO TURKEY\r\n\r\n     A surgical operation delays my departure--Roosevelt in Africa\r\n     delighted with my return to Turkey under Taft\r\n     Administration--Received by another Sultan--A royal weakling--The\r\n     invisible power of the new regime--Foreign concessions and\r\n     political intrigues--Turkish funeral customs--The Mohammedan\r\n     indifference to death--Roosevelt urges me to meet him in Cairo--We\r\n     visit Salonica and Athens--Received by King George of Greece\r\n     --Roosevelt's arrival at Cairo--The Kaiser's invitation--Roosevelt\r\n     condemns assassination of Premier despite warning to avoid subject\r\n     in his address--Roosevelt declines an audience with the Pope--At\r\n     tea with Prince and Princess Eitel Friedrich--A distinguished Arab\r\n     on international relations--Rumblings in the Balkans--The brilliant\r\n     Venizelos--My objections to \"dollar diplomacy\"--Former\r\n     Vice-President and Mrs. Fairbanks visit us--Other distinguished\r\n     Americans visit the Embassy--We visit the King and Queen of\r\n     Roumania--How the Queen adopted the pen-name \"Carmen Sylva\"--The\r\n     cell-like study of the Queen--Vienna and London--Two Rothschilds\r\n     express their views of the Triple Entente--\"The greatest pleasure\r\n     of going abroad is returning home\"--Reflections of the rift between\r\n     the Roosevelt policies and the Taft Administration.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy return to private life in 1909 did not prove a disturbing transition\r\nfor me, notwithstanding the fact that, on entering the Cabinet in 1906,\r\nI had terminated all of my professional and business interests, I had no\r\nplans for the future. I had always entered public office not without\r\nsome trepidation, and had always retired from such an office with a\r\ncertain sense of relief and satisfaction. But my past training and\r\nnatural disposition had by no means prepared me to be content with a\r\nlife of \"elegant leisure,\" I soon found much to occupy my energies, and\r\nagain took part in numerous semi-public activities, and my cooperation\r\nseemed all the more welcome because of my experience in office both at\r\nhome and abroad.\r\n\r\nSoon after my return to New York, I was formally welcomed at a banquet\r\nat the Hotel Astor, under the auspices of a number of prominent\r\ncitizens, led by William McCarroll, who had succeeded me as president of\r\nthe New York Board of Trade when I had left for Washington. It was, of\r\ncourse, gratifying to me to receive this attention from my fellow\r\ncitizens, irrespective of party, among whom I expected to pass my\r\nremaining years. Among the speakers were John Mitchel, St. Clair\r\nMcKelway, Richard Watson Gilder, poet and editor of the \"Century\r\nMagazine\"; the Reverend Leander Chamberlain, and Dr. Lyman Abbott. Dr.\r\nAbbott, one of America's foremost intellectual and spiritual leaders, is\r\nthe only surviving member of this group, and I am happy to be able to\r\nrecord that he is still in good health, with his pen, which has lost\r\nnothing of its charm and vigor, ever inspiring.\r\n\r\nI quite dismissed from my mind any idea of holding office in the Taft\r\nAdministration, especially after Taft had reconsidered his statement or\r\npromise to Roosevelt to retain me in the Cabinet. Shortly after my\r\nreturn from Washington, however, on March 13, 1909, President Taft wrote\r\nme that he would be glad to have me accept the embassy at\r\nConstantinople, and that in time he would transfer me to some other post\r\nthat might be more acceptable. He concluded: \"I hope this will meet your\r\nview, because I should like to have you in my administration.\"\r\n\r\nMy personal relations with Mr. Taft had of course always been most\r\ncordial and agreeable. I wrote him that, naturally, I had no desire to\r\nreturn to a post which I had occupied twice before, unless extraordinary\r\nconditions developed which particularly required my past experience\r\nthere and made it imperative that I accept as a public duty, and even\r\nthen I should accept only for a short time.\r\n\r\nThe President wrote me that he would be glad to have me accept the post\r\nat Constantinople (which had been raised to an embassy since my last\r\nmission), and that in time he would transfer me either to Japan or to\r\nsome acceptable post in Europe, and I soon received the following letter\r\nfrom the State Department:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 _April 29, 1909_\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR MR. STRAUS:\r\n\r\n     The President now desires me to make to you the formal offer of the\r\n     post of Ambassador to Turkey. The epoch-making events now occurring\r\n     in the Turkish Empire bring with them difficulties and\r\n     opportunities which make that post take on even greater importance,\r\n     and the President feels that your past service and keen knowledge\r\n     of the Near East make you peculiarly qualified to take charge at\r\n     this time of the important Embassy at Constantinople.\r\n\r\n     Adverting to your previous conversations with the President and\r\n     with me, relative to your disinclination to accept a post which you\r\n     have previously held, I would add that the President would be glad\r\n     to consider your transfer from Constantinople to some other post if\r\n     an opportune time should arrive when this was practicable and when\r\n     you wished to relinquish the important mission which is now\r\n     tendered to you.\r\n\r\n         I am, my dear Mr. Straus,\r\n                             Very sincerely yours\r\n                                                  P. C. KNOX\r\n\r\nIn June, while I was getting ready for my departure, I was compelled to\r\nundergo an operation for appendicitis. I therefore wrote the President\r\nasking him to relieve me of my appointment, as my illness would delay me\r\nfor another month or more. The President promptly advised me not to be\r\ndisturbed by the delay, that he would be glad to wait until my health\r\nwas entirely restored before having me start, and that it was not\r\npossible, because of the troubled conditions in Turkey, at that time to\r\nfind any one to replace me.\r\n\r\nAt this time I received a letter from Roosevelt, addressed from the\r\nheart of British East Africa, expressing pleasure at my again going to\r\nTurkey:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        SAIGO SOI, LAKE NAIVASHA\r\n                                            _16th July, 1909_\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR MR. AMBASSADOR:\r\n\r\n     Your letter gave me real pleasure. Mrs. Roosevelt had written of\r\n     you, and your dear wife, and two beautiful daughters, coming out to\r\n     see her; and she told me how much she enjoyed your visit. As for\r\n     the address at the dedication of the memorial window, my dear\r\n     fellow, you said the very things that I would most like to have\r\n     said about me, especially coming from a man whom I so much respect\r\n     and who is my close personal friend.\r\n\r\n     I am delighted that you have accepted the Turkish Embassy. The\r\n     situation was wholly changed by the revolution, and at this moment\r\n     I think that Constantinople is the most important and most\r\n     interesting diplomatic post in the world.\r\n\r\n     I shan't try to write to you at any length, for I find it simply\r\n     impossible to keep up with correspondence here in camp, and am able\r\n     to write my letters at all at the moment only because a friend has\r\n     turned up with a typewriter.\r\n\r\n     I can't say how I look forward to seeing you. I know nothing\r\n     whatever of American politics at the present moment. We have had a\r\n     very successful and enjoyable trip.\r\n\r\n     With love to Mrs. Straus and with hearty congratulations not to you\r\n     but to our country for your having gone to Turkey, I am\r\n\r\n                          Faithfully yours\r\n                                        THEODORE ROOSEVELT\r\n\r\nThe first paragraph refers to an address I had made in May. The Reverend\r\nJ. Wesley Hill, of the Metropolitan Temple, had one of the windows of\r\nhis church dedicated to the Roosevelt Administration and I was asked to\r\ndeliver the principal address. I took for my subject \"The Spirit of the\r\nRoosevelt Administration,\" and reviewed the leading progressive acts of\r\nthe Administration and pointed out how they were all aimed to secure\r\nthe rights and enlarge the opportunities of the plain people. I had in\r\nmind counteracting the influence then current to belittle the work of\r\nthe Roosevelt Administration. For with the beginning of the Taft\r\nAdministration, the reactionaries in and out of Congress had become more\r\nbitter and outspoken in their opposition to the Roosevelt policies; it\r\nseems that they were encouraged by the report that a break had taken\r\nplace between Roosevelt and Taft, and by the fact that certain Senators\r\nand members of the House who had fallen out with Roosevelt seemed to be\r\nspecially welcomed at the White House. My address was therefore widely\r\nquoted in the press and subsequently circulated in pamphlet form. I\r\nquote one of its salient paragraphs:\r\n\r\n     All the Roosevelt measures and policies were based not only upon\r\n     moral convictions, but upon a statesman's forethought for the\r\n     welfare of the country. That he would encounter the powerful\r\n     opposition of the offending corporate interests was to be foreseen\r\n     and expected. All reforms and reformers no less in our country than\r\n     in others have encountered the reactionaries of privilege and\r\n     power, who persuaded themselves that their so-called vested\r\n     interests, however acquired and however administered, were their\r\n     vested rights. These trespassing reactionaries when not checked and\r\n     made obedient to the legitimate needs and righteous demands of the\r\n     many produced a spirit of revenge which broke out into revolution\r\n     at the extreme opposite end of the social system.\r\n\r\nOn August 18th Mrs. Straus and I left New York on the S.S. Prinz\r\nFriedrich Wilhelm for Cherbourg. A week later we were in Paris, where we\r\nmet Mrs. Roosevelt with three of her children, Ethel, Archie, and\r\nQuentin. During the fortnight of our stay we saw a great deal of them\r\nand several times we went to the theater or sight-seeing together. Mrs.\r\nRoosevelt told me that her husband had solicitously inquired about us\r\nin several of his letters and suggested that I write him.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached Constantinople on September 18th, the month of Ramazan\r\nhad begun, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Rifaat Pasha, informed\r\nme that the Sultan, now Mohammed V, brother of Abdul Hamid, would\r\nprobably delay receiving me for a week or ten days, until the middle of\r\nRamazan, and not at the end, as was customary with the former Sultan.\r\nAccordingly I was received on Monday, October 4th.\r\n\r\nThe residence of the new Sultan was in the Palace of Dolma Bagtche. As\r\nmy rank now was that of ambassador, this audience was a more ceremonious\r\none than those of my former missions. Eight royal carriages came from\r\nthe Palace to conduct me and my staff to the residence of His Royal\r\nMajesty. The first of these, in which I rode, was a most gorgeous\r\naffair, with outriders and two postilions in uniforms of brilliant\r\ncolors standing on a platform in the rear of the carriage. The streets\r\nof Pera were crowded with spectators as these dazzling equipages went\r\nby, in spite of a light rain that was falling. As we entered the Palace,\r\na large troop of soldiers arranged along each side of the main gate\r\npresented arms. I was met by the Chief Introducer of Ambassadors and\r\nseveral other officials, who conducted me to the audience chamber above.\r\nWith my dragoman, Mr. Gargiulo, I then proceeded with the Chief\r\nIntroducer of Ambassadors into the presence of the Sultan while the rest\r\nof my staff were detained in an anteroom.\r\n\r\nThe Sultan was a man of about sixty-five, short and very thick-set. He\r\nwas dressed in military uniform, but appeared physically inert and\r\nclumsy. During the whole thirty-three years' reign of his brother, Abdul\r\nHamid, he had been imprisoned in a palace on the Bosphorus and kept\r\nunder constant guard. He grew up in ignorance and his appearance clearly\r\nindicated mental backwardness. His eyes were dull and his appearance\r\nalmost that of an imbecile, except when an occasional spark of animation\r\nwas noticeable. Withal he seemed kind and good-natured.\r\n\r\nWhen I made my address, I felt as though I were speaking to an image\r\nrather than a human being, and I went through it as quickly as possible,\r\nomitting some parts for the sake of brevity, realizing that it was\r\nsimply a form and that the Introducer of Ambassadors would presently\r\nread the whole of it in Turkish. The Sultan was then handed the Turkish\r\nreply to read, which he did haltingly, even consulting the Introducer at\r\ntimes to decipher a word. That being over, the doors to the anteroom\r\nwere thrown open and my staff entered, also the consul-general and his\r\nstaff, and each man was presented to the Sultan. We were then conducted\r\nback to the anteroom and served with cigarettes and coffee, even though\r\nit was Ramazan, when Mohammedans do not drink or smoke until after\r\nsundown. In a few minutes more we were conducted back to our carriages.\r\nThe whole function was more in the nature of mimicry on the stage than a\r\nserious diplomatic performance.\r\n\r\nWith my dragoman I paid my official calls upon the Grand Vizier and the\r\nMinister of Foreign Affairs at the Porte, both of whom received me in\r\nfull-dress uniform and immediately returned the calls.\r\n\r\nThe Government of Turkey under the new regime, with a Sultan who was\r\nmerely a figurehead, was in the hands of the ministry, and the ministers\r\nin turn were appointed and controlled by the Young Turks, or so-called\r\nparty of \"Union and Progress\" which had brought on the revolution of\r\n1908 and deposed the late Sultan in April, 1909. It required no great\r\ninsight to see that a government thus controlled by an invisible power\r\nwithout official responsibility could not be one of either liberty or\r\nprogress; yet the leading ministers were men of ability and some of them\r\nmen of considerable experience. Rifaat Pasha, for instance, was formerly\r\nambassador to London, an intelligent and thoroughly enlightened\r\nstatesman. Hussein Hilmi Pasha, the Grand Vizier, was the former member\r\nof a joint committee charged with the government of Macedonia. Talaat\r\nBey, the Minister of the Interior, had previously held an inferior\r\nposition. He was one of the leading representatives of the Young Turk\r\nParty and was believed to be the one mainly responsible for the terrible\r\nslaughter and martyrdom of Armenians during the World War. After that\r\nwar he fled to Berlin, where, in 1920, he was assassinated by a young\r\nArmenian. Djavid Bey, Minister of Finance, was a remarkably brilliant\r\nyoung man, about thirty-four years old, from Salonica. It was said he\r\nwas a Donmeh; that is, a member of a sect of apostate Jews also known as\r\nSabbatians from the name of its Messiah or prophet, Sabbatai Zevi, who\r\ngave the sect its romantic origin in the middle of the seventeenth\r\ncentury. Professor Graetz gives a full and interesting description of\r\nthis whole movement in his \"History of the Jews.\"\r\n\r\nAmong my colleagues were Gerard Lowther, who represented Great Britain;\r\nMarquis Imperiali, Italy; and Baron Marschall von Bieberstein, Germany.\r\nBecause of the lack of general society in Constantinople, the members of\r\nthe diplomatic corps became very intimate with one another, and this was\r\nso with my colleagues generally and especially between the German\r\nambassador and myself, for we were also fellow members of the Hague\r\nTribunal, and in 1907 he was chairman of the German delegation at the\r\nConferences. He was by far the ablest and most forceful diplomat in\r\nConstantinople at this period. During his term of office there, German\r\ninfluence in the Ottoman Empire entirely overshadowed the British. This\r\ninfluence started its ascendancy following the visit of the Emperor in\r\n1898, when he obtained the promise of the concession for the building of\r\nthe Bagdad Railway.\r\n\r\nWhen first the Ottoman Government granted this concession, the\r\nfinanciers of Great Britain, France, and Germany had come to a tentative\r\nagreement for the joint construction of the road. The Germans then\r\nwanted more than an equal control in the enterprise, and the\r\nnegotiations fell through. Had the interests of Great Britain and\r\nGermany been united in the Near East, there probably would have been\r\nquite a different alignment of Powers on the chessboard of Europe, and\r\nperhaps the World War would have been prevented. The Bagdad Railway, if\r\njointly constructed, would have contributed to a better understanding\r\nbetween Great Britain and Germany instead of accentuating more and more\r\ntheir differences as the road proceeded toward the Persian Gulf.\r\n\r\nI could plainly see evidences, both in social life in the Turkish\r\ncapital and in the unmistakable trend of diplomatic alignments, of a\r\nrapidly developing entente between Great Britain, France, and Russia.\r\nSince the Russo-Japanese War, and with the coming of the new regime in\r\nTurkey, Russia had changed her attitude toward Turkey and had become\r\nextremely friendly. Italy maintained a neutral attitude as between Great\r\nBritain and Germany. Austria, as always, if not controlled by, was in\r\nclose sympathy with, Germany.\r\n\r\nAbdul Hamid had developed into the most autocratic ruler of modern\r\ntimes. With the overthrow of his regime and its colossal system of\r\nsecret agents, there was hope for a gradual development of a\r\nparliamentary government, especially as some of the officials in the\r\nTurkish ministry were forward-looking men, of considerable ability and\r\nhonesty of purpose. However, just as the jealousy between the Great\r\nPowers had prevented the dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire for a\r\nhundred years or more, so the same jealousy prevented rehabilitation.\r\nGreat Britain favored the building up of Turkey; the policy of Russia,\r\nGermany, and Austria was to keep Turkey weak and disorganized.\r\n\r\nWith the establishment of the new regime Germany, England, France, and\r\nItaly sought concessions from the Government for the development of\r\nmines and the building of railroads, docks, and other public utilities.\r\nThe country was rich and undeveloped, and the Turks themselves had\r\nneither the capacity nor the money for such undertakings. But the effect\r\nof these concessions was undermining the sovereignty and was\r\nforeshadowing conflict.\r\n\r\nWith the passing of the old regime and the beginning of the new, an\r\nappalling massacre of Armenians had taken place in Cilicia; and it was\r\nbelieved that this massacre, which cost the lives of twenty thousand or\r\nmore victims, was engineered by the old regime to discredit the new.\r\n\r\nThe first fall of the new ministry was brought about by what was known\r\nas the Lynch affair, which concerned a steamship monopoly of an English\r\ncompany on the Tigris and Euphrates. The Lynch Company had a perpetual\r\nconcession to navigate two steamers from the Persian Gulf to Bassora,\r\nand from there to Bagdad on the Tigris and as far as navigable on the\r\nEuphrates. There was also a Turkish company with a similar concession,\r\nand the English company undertook negotiations with the Grand Vizier for\r\nthe consolidation of the two companies, by which the Lynch Company was\r\nto pay the Ottoman Government L160,000 in cash. The new company was to\r\nhave a grant for seventy-two years, with the right given to the Ottoman\r\nGovernment to buy it all out at the end of thirty-six years on a basis\r\nto be agreed upon. The new company was to have the monopoly of the\r\nnavigation, and it was to have an English president with a board of\r\ndirectors composed half of Englishmen and half of Turkish subjects.\r\n\r\nThe arrangements were made on behalf of the ministry by the Grand\r\nVizier, Hilmi Pasha, and the matter was then brought up under\r\ninterpellation in the Parliament. The first vote taken was against\r\nconfirmation of the transaction. This amounted to an expression of lack\r\nof confidence in the ministry, whereupon the Grand Vizier stated that\r\nunless the transaction was confirmed, he and his colleagues would\r\nresign. Two days later, on motion of Djavid Bey, the eloquent Minister\r\nof Finance, the whole matter was reconsidered and an equally large vote\r\ncast confirming the transaction. Aside from registering confidence or\r\nthe lack of it in the ministry, the vote against confirmation would also\r\nhave been interpreted as an act of hostility toward England. For the\r\ntime being the problem was settled.\r\n\r\nShortly thereafter, however, there arose in the Bagdad vilayet such\r\nopposition to this transaction that the deputies from that province\r\nthreatened to withdraw from Parliament. The negotiations were regarded\r\nas a victory for England in the strengthening of her influence along the\r\nPersian Gulf, and a defeat for the Germans, whose railway terminus would\r\nbe at Bassora, at the junction of the two rivers. The Persian Gulf, on\r\nthe other hand, was of strategic interest to Great Britain because it is\r\nthe corridor to India. German influence proved the stronger with the\r\nYoung Turks, and the consolidation of the Lynch Company with the Turkish\r\ncompany was not confirmed.\r\n\r\nThis vote resulted in the fall of the ministry, for a month later the\r\nYoung Turks forced the resignation of the Grand Vizier. In giving his\r\nresignation to the Sultan, the Grand Vizier stated his reason as poor\r\nhealth, but that was merely for public consumption. Talaat Bey and\r\nDjavid Bey were known to be prominent members of the Young Turks, and\r\nthe Grand Vizier, who had been Minister of the Interior and then Grand\r\nVizier under the former Sultan, was not fully trusted as being in accord\r\nwith the regime of the Young Turks. To bridge over this ministerial\r\ncrisis the Young Turks offered to Hakki Pasha, ambassador at Rome, the\r\ngrand viziership, which he accepted.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEarly in the year 1910 the diplomatic circle in Constantinople was\r\nthrown, if not into gloom, at least into official mourning. The Grand\r\nDuke Nicolaiovich, uncle of Czar Nicholas of Russia, and King Leopold of\r\nBelgium, died. At Constantinople, more than at any capital in the world,\r\nceremonies of any kind were exaggerated to make an impression upon the\r\nTurkish mind. And so in both these instances elaborate funeral services\r\nwere held which the diplomatic representatives attended in full uniform,\r\nloaded with all decorations. The service for the Grand Duke lasted about\r\ntwo hours, although no one apparently listened to any part but the\r\nsinging, and there was a general sigh of relief when it was over. The\r\nservice for the Belgian king was of a similar nature, with the addition\r\nof a huge catafalque, surmounted by a crown, erected in the center of\r\nthe church, which was so cold that most of us kept on our overcoats.\r\n\r\nShortly thereafter I attended a third funeral, this time a Turkish one.\r\nHamdy Bey, director and organizer of the Imperial Museum, had died on\r\nFebruary 24, 1910, at about sixty-eight years of age. I had known him\r\nfor twenty years; he had always been courteous and obliging to American\r\nvisitors, and had shown many special favors to me, notably in regard to\r\nthe permit for the Babylonian excavations. The services took place at\r\neleven in the morning in front of the entrance to the Sophia Mosque. The\r\nfuneral cortege consisted of about a dozen dervishes clad in long black\r\nrobes with high conical head-coverings made of rough yellowish-gray\r\nwoolen material, and about three times the height of an ordinary fez.\r\nThey chanted in plaintive tones, \"Allah! Allah! Allah!\" Next came the\r\ncoffin-bearers, six in number. As is the custom among the Mohammedans,\r\nthe coffin was of plain boards, covered with shawls, over which was\r\ndraped a black covering with some phrases from the Koran worked into it.\r\nOn top of the coffin was the red fez or head-covering of the deceased.\r\nBehind the coffin walked many of the leading officials of the Government\r\nand other prominent people. The entire ministry was present. I joined\r\nthe procession shortly before reaching the mosque and was asked to walk\r\nbeside Rifaat Pasha, the Minister of Foreign Affairs. I was the only\r\nrepresentative of a foreign power present, and my attendance was warmly\r\nappreciated by the Turkish officials and by the relatives of the\r\ndeceased.\r\n\r\nWhen the procession reached the mosque, the coffin was placed upon the\r\npediment of a Greek column near the entrance, an appropriate place for\r\nit to rest, I thought. All the mourners having gathered round, one of\r\nthe imans or priests standing by the coffin recited a prayer of about\r\nsix minutes' duration, in the midst of which he put the following\r\nquestions in Turkish to the bystanders:\r\n\r\n\"You all knew Hamdy Bey; what kind of a man was he?\"\r\n\r\nAnd the audience replied \"Eyi,\" meaning \"good.\"\r\n\r\n\"If he has done any wrong to you, do you forgive him?\"\r\n\r\nTheir reply in Turkish signified, \"We do.\"\r\n\r\nThe body was then borne on the shoulders of the carriers to the museum\r\nenclosure which was near by, in front of the Chinili Kiosque. Djavid Bey\r\nthen mounted the marble portico and from there delivered a funeral\r\noration lasting about twelve minutes, in which he referred to the\r\nexcellent work accomplished by the deceased under the most trying\r\ncircumstances during the reign of corruption and oppression, and pointed\r\nto the buildings surrounding the enclosure as the most fitting and\r\nlasting memorial.\r\n\r\nA funeral among the Mohammedans is not regarded as a cause for mourning.\r\nDeath is looked upon as a matter of course. Every respect is shown the\r\nmemory of the deceased, but there is neither sanctimony nor suppressed\r\nsorrow at the funeral service. This is doubtless due to the spirit of\r\nfatalism deeply embedded in their religion, and which colors so deeply\r\nthe life and philosophy of a Mohammedan.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of prayer on the part of the bystanders during this\r\nceremony was one I had never observed at the ordinary services in the\r\nmosques. They all stood erect, arms horizontally extended forward from\r\nthe elbow, palms turned upward. The simplicity of the whole service\r\nimpressed me very much. The entire dramatic scene, in its picturesque\r\nsurroundings, was unforgettable. The day was bright and beautiful, and\r\nthe Bosphorus wore its most attractive coloring. Turkish functions,\r\nwhether official or ceremonial, are always arranged with quiet dignity\r\nand precision.\r\n\r\nAmong the pleasant things during this sojourn in Constantinople was a\r\ntrip to Cairo to meet Roosevelt. On New Year's Day, 1910, I received a\r\nnote from him scribbled off in pencil, asking that I meet him if\r\npossible about March 22d at Cairo; he would wire me later from the upper\r\nNile a more exact date. He could not come to Constantinople because he\r\nhad to include Christiania in his itinerary, which made it a little\r\ndifficult to carry out his plans.\r\n\r\nIn due time I received a telegram from him from Gondokoro, on the lower\r\nNile, to meet him on March 23d. Accordingly Mrs. Straus and I started\r\nfrom Constantinople on March 7th in the embassy dispatch boat, Scorpion,\r\na ship of about seven hundred and fifty tons, manned by a crew of\r\nseventy-five or eighty bluejackets. We left a little early in order to\r\nbe able to make stops at several ports on the way, notably Salonica,\r\nwhich in many respects was the most advanced city of the empire. It had\r\nabout 135,000 inhabitants, of whom some 20,000 were Greek, 15,000\r\nBulgarian and other Balkan peoples, and the rest chiefly Jews. The\r\nancestors of many of the latter had settled there centuries before as\r\nrefugees from Spain at the time of the Inquisition. As was the case with\r\nmany of the other Jews of Turkey their language was Ladino, a Spanish\r\ndialect.\r\n\r\nWe stayed at Salonica three days and visited the principal institutions\r\nof the city, and the Jewish hospitals and schools, all of which I found\r\nsuperior to any I had seen in Turkey proper. They were conducted on\r\nmodern scientific lines. The leaders of finance and industry were the\r\nJews and the Greeks, while at the same time the hewers of wood and the\r\ndrawers of water, those who loaded the ships and did the hauling, were\r\nalso principally Jews.\r\n\r\nNext we stopped at Athens, where we met my brother Isidor and his wife,\r\nwho were making a tour of the Orient. Our six-days' stay in Athens was\r\nmade delightful for us by the courtesies of our minister, George H.\r\nMoses, now and for some years past United States Senator from New\r\nHampshire. We visited the Boule, or Greek Chamber, one afternoon. What\r\nmainly impressed one was the lack of decorum and dignity. The Minister\r\nof War, who also represented the military league, was the dominating\r\npower. I thought then how unfortunate it was for a country to be ruled\r\nby the sabered politician. Then truly does the army become a curse to\r\nthe Government, as well as inefficient for the protection it is supposed\r\nto give. When the army enters politics, then politics also enters the\r\narmy, a double calamity for any state. But that seemed to be the\r\nlamentable condition of Greece as I saw it at that time.\r\n\r\nWe were received in audience by King George, who spoke perfect English.\r\nI had met him before, on my visit to Athens in 1888. He conversed freely\r\nand with the objectiveness of an outsider about the disturbed political\r\nconditions of Greece, which was at the time dominated by a military\r\nleague, a secret organization of army officers. Referring to this\r\nleague, the King said that outsiders probably regarded him as weak in\r\ngiving way to its demands, but that they did not appreciate conditions;\r\nhe did it to prevent a revolution, and he hoped that unity among the\r\npeople might be promoted by the approaching meeting of the Assembly for\r\nthe revision of the constitution.\r\n\r\nHe seemed remarkably well informed regarding our system of government\r\nand American affairs generally. He said that Greece needed a council of\r\nstate with cooerdinate legislative power, rather than a senate. He\r\nappeared to favor a small appointed body rather than an elective\r\nsenate. He said he had been in Greece for fifty years; he had come there\r\nwhen he was eighteen and was educated for the navy. He added drily that\r\nit might have been better if he had stuck to the profession of his\r\ntraining.\r\n\r\nHe knew I was on my way to Egypt to meet Roosevelt for whom he expressed\r\nthe greatest admiration. He said he had read several of Roosevelt's\r\nbooks and had always had a desire to meet him.\r\n\r\nWe went on to Alexandria by the Roumanian boat. The sea seemed rough, so\r\nwe thought best to send the Scorpion on ahead so that we might make the\r\ntrip leisurely, and on March 21st we arrived in Cairo, where\r\nConsul-General Iddings had reserved rooms for us at the Shepheard Hotel,\r\nadjoining the suite reserved for the Roosevelts.\r\n\r\nThe Roosevelt party arrived from Luxor at about nine o'clock on the\r\nmorning of March 24th. We went to the station to meet the train, and\r\nthere was quite a gathering, including the consul-general and his wife,\r\nan aide of the Khedive, an aide of the Sirdar, a number of American\r\nmissionaries, and several others. Cairo was astir. American flags were\r\nflying on many buildings, and at the hotel a great crowd cheered as\r\nRoosevelt entered.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast the first morning, Roosevelt wanted me to read several\r\nletters he had dictated, among others a reply to the invitation that had\r\nbeen extended by the Kaiser asking Roosevelt to be his guest in the\r\npalace in Berlin. The invitation did not include Mrs. Roosevelt, and\r\nthis he resented. He therefore dictated a letter to Ambassador David J.\r\nHill saying he would be pleased to call on the Emperor on the day\r\ndesignated, but could not accept the invitation to be his guest, as he\r\ndid not purpose to separate from Mrs. Roosevelt. He asked Ambassador\r\nHill to be sure to submit the message to the Emperor's chamberlain in\r\nsuch a way that it could not be construed as a hint for an invitation\r\nfor Mrs. Roosevelt. I advised against sending this letter and asked him\r\nto let me handle the matter. This I did, and Ambassador Hill soon\r\ndiscovered, what I had suspected, that the Emperor was not aware at the\r\ntime the invitation was sent that Mrs. Roosevelt was with her husband.\r\nThe omission was immediately corrected.\r\n\r\nRoosevelt was, of course, anxious for news from home. He spoke again of\r\nTaft's having told him he would retain Garfield and myself, and said\r\nTaft was aware that he (Roosevelt) was specially attached to us both. I\r\nshowed him an article in a current \"North American Review,\" entitled\r\n\"The First Year of Taft's Administration,\" which plainly showed that\r\nmuch ground had been lost.\r\n\r\nRoosevelt was to deliver an address before the Egyptian National\r\nUniversity. He handed me the draft of it and asked me to criticize it\r\nfreely. I suggested a number of changes, which he promptly adopted. He\r\nhad been asked not to refer to the recent assassination of the Premier\r\nof Egypt, Budros Pasha--a deed that had probably been inspired by the\r\nNationalists, a party composed chiefly of young students, half-educated\r\ntheorists, and a few others whose shibboleth was \"Egypt for the\r\nEgyptians.\" Roosevelt considered that it would be cowardly and evasive\r\nto avoid this subject, and that usually the subjects one is asked not to\r\nrefer to are the ones uppermost in the minds of the people. Besides, if\r\nhe did not openly condemn such an act, his silence might be interpreted\r\nas an approval. In view of all the circumstances I fully agreed with\r\nhim. The speech was delivered in a large hall filled to capacity; the\r\nconsular body and many Egyptian ministers were present. About one third\r\nof the audience understood English, and the address was\r\nenthusiastically received, and had an excellent effect, as I afterward\r\nlearned, upon law and order in Egypt.\r\n\r\nRoosevelt gave a luncheon at the hotel to Sir Gaston Maspero and\r\nProfessor Sayce, the eminent Egyptologists, which we attended. There\r\nwere about fifteen people present, among them Mr. Lawrence F. Abbott, of\r\n\"The Outlook,\" who had joined the Roosevelt party at Khartum. It was a\r\ndelightful occasion and reminded us of the old days at the White House.\r\nRoosevelt always had the faculty of surrounding himself with people who,\r\nwhether from prominent or humble walks of life, were worth while. There\r\nwere so many facets to his nature that he could make interesting\r\ncontacts with all sorts of folk, those of the forest as well as those of\r\nthe closet.\r\n\r\nFrom Gondokoro, Roosevelt had written Ambassador Leishman at Rome saying\r\nhe would be glad of the honor of presentation to His Holiness Pope Pius\r\nX. At Cairo he received the following cable reply from Ambassador\r\nLeishman:\r\n\r\n     The Rector of the American Catholic College, Monsignor Kennedy, in\r\n     reply to inquiry which I caused to be made, requests that the\r\n     following communication be transmitted to you: \"The Holy Father\r\n     will be delighted to grant audience to Mr. Roosevelt on April 5,\r\n     and hopes nothing will arise to prevent it, such as the\r\n     much-regretted incident which made the reception of Mr. Fairbanks\r\n     impossible.\"\r\n\r\n     I merely transmit this communication without having committed you\r\n     in any way to accept the conditions imposed, as the form appears\r\n     objectionable, clearly indicating that an audience would be\r\n     canceled in case you should take any action while here that might\r\n     be construed as countenancing the Methodist mission work here....\r\n\r\nMr. Fairbanks, it may be remembered, was granted an audience with His\r\nHoliness, but on the same day accepted an invitation to lecture before\r\nthe Methodist body in Rome whose propaganda was inimical to the Vatican.\r\nThis displeased His Holiness and the audience was thereupon canceled.\r\n\r\nRoosevelt answered Leishman's cable to the effect that while he fully\r\nrecognized the right of the Holy Father to receive or not to receive\r\nwhomsoever he chose, he could not submit to conditions which would in\r\nany way limit his freedom of conduct. But the Vatican stood firm on the\r\nconditions set forth:\r\n\r\n     His Holiness will be much pleased to grant an audience to Mr.\r\n     Roosevelt, for whom he entertains great esteem, both personally and\r\n     as President of the United States. His Holiness quite recognizes\r\n     Mr. Roosevelt's entire right to freedom of conduct. On the other\r\n     hand, in view of the circumstances, for which neither His Holiness\r\n     nor Mr. Roosevelt is responsible, an audience could not occur\r\n     except on the understanding expressed in the former message.\r\n\r\nConsequently, while Roosevelt did not go to the Vatican, he was received\r\nwith great cordiality at the Quirinal by King Victor Emmanuel III. In\r\norder not to have the Vatican incident misunderstood at home, Roosevelt\r\nsent a message regarding it to the American people, through the pages of\r\n\"The Outlook\" of April 9, 1910. Mr. Abbott makes detailed mention of the\r\nepisode in his \"Impressions of Theodore Roosevelt.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMrs. Straus and I were invited to luncheon with Sir Eldon and Lady\r\nGorst, British consul-general at Cairo, where we met Professor Oscar\r\nBrowning, of Cambridge, among others. Sir Eldon was the successor of\r\nLord Cromer, and had had many years of experience in Egypt in official\r\ncapacities. He spoke of the unrest among the natives, especially those\r\nwho had lived abroad as university students. These were in fact the\r\nleaders of the Nationalist Party, a movement stimulated by the\r\nestablishment of the new regime in Turkey and the parliamentary form of\r\ngovernment in Persia. Some of the Arabic papers were encouraging, if not\r\nactually inciting, opposition to the British protectorate. He said the\r\nBritish policy was to grant by degrees an always larger share of local\r\nself-government, but it was feared that if the national spirit was too\r\nmuch encouraged there would be a reversion to conditions that prevailed\r\nprior to the British occupation of the country. He explained that Lord\r\nCromer's administration covered the period of national improvements,\r\nsuch as the reform of taxes, and the building of railways and irrigation\r\nworks; and that now had come the desire for political changes.\r\n\r\nI have referred to that part of Roosevelt's speech at the National\r\nUniversity in which he condemned the assassination of the premier. Sir\r\nEldon said he had been consulted in regard to the speech before its\r\ndelivery, and that if he had expressed any objection he was sure Mr.\r\nRoosevelt would either have omitted that part of the address or declined\r\nto speak altogether, for he knew Mr. Roosevelt would not do anything to\r\nembarrass British interests. He had had no objection, and made this\r\nclear to Mr. Iddings, who made the inquiry.\r\n\r\nWe were all invited to a tea at the German Diplomatic Agency, to meet\r\nthe Prince and Princess Eitel Friedrich, who were on a visit to Egypt.\r\nEitel Friedrich is the second son of William II of Germany. I had little\r\nopportunity to speak with him because he and Roosevelt were engaged\r\nalmost the entire time in an animated conversation, during which both\r\nremained standing. My impression of the Prince was that he seemed\r\ntremendously impressed with his own importance. I had a pleasant chat\r\nwith the Princess, whom I found very charming. She seemed to me of a\r\ntype more Austrian than German.\r\n\r\nOn March 30th we left Cairo, going with the Roosevelt party as far as\r\nAlexandria, where they boarded a ship for Naples, and we went aboard the\r\nScorpion. Our little ship was dressed in its complimentary flags, the\r\nband was playing, and the commander had drawn up the bluejackets on the\r\nmain deck to present arms, so that the Roosevelt party was being saluted\r\nwith all the form, splendor, and dignity that our ship could muster. The\r\nsea was much calmer than when we came, and we reached Constantinople in\r\na little less than three days. I had intended stopping at several other\r\nports to confer with our consuls, and to visit Jerusalem, Beirut, and\r\nSmyrna; but as my instructions were to hasten my return I did so.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring my third mission in Turkey I saw quite a good deal of Mahmoud\r\nChevket Pasha, the generalissimo of the Turkish army, who was at the\r\nsame time Minister of War. He was fifty-two years old, of spare frame,\r\nmedium height, with a full beard that was turning gray. He was an Arab,\r\nborn in Bagdad. He told me that, when he was a younger man and a major\r\nin the army, he spent ten years in Germany studying the German military\r\nsystem and training. It was evident to every observer that under his\r\ngeneralship the Turkish army had vastly improved both in appearance and\r\nin discipline.\r\n\r\nI found him a well-educated, modern man. At that time he enjoyed a\r\nworld-wide reputation as the most important and dominating official in\r\nthe empire, because, as general of the Third Army Corps, stationed at\r\nSalonica, he had marched his men to Constantinople, dethroned the late\r\nSultan, and established the new regime. Within a few months he had made\r\nvisits to Austria, France, and Germany, and was received with great\r\nhonors. In the leading cities of these countries he made addresses that\r\nwere statesmanlike and internationally tactful. Throughout he\r\nrepresented his country with admirable tact and judgment.\r\n\r\nDuring one of our conversations the generalissimo told me that the only\r\ncloud on the horizon was the effort of the Greeks to make the Island of\r\nCrete a part of their country. He thought the general conditions in\r\nTurkey were good and that there was no danger of internal troubles,\r\nbecause the Government had things well in hand. Should Greece make any\r\nhostile move, he knew Turkey could easily defeat her. He did not think\r\nthat any of the Balkan Powers would join Greece, since they could not do\r\nso without drawing in some of the big Powers, and the latter would not,\r\nas a matter of self-interest, allow the Balkan States to join Greece in\r\na war.\r\n\r\nWe were speaking rather frankly, and I asked him whether he thought\r\nRussia desired the advancement of Turkey and its steady growth under the\r\nnew regime. He realized that Russia was then entirely friendly, but said\r\nit was not because she favored a progressive Turkey, but because since\r\nher war with Japan she was in no position to take advantage of the\r\nmisfortunes of Turkey. I asked him what he thought of the real attitude\r\nof Germany. He answered that he thought Germany entirely friendly; that\r\nher desire was, of course, to advance her commercial interests in the\r\nOttoman Empire, but that in this respect she was perhaps not different\r\nfrom other nations who regarded Turkey as a good field for commercial\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nShortly thereafter the political atmosphere was considerably disturbed\r\nby the Crete affair, just as Chevket Pasha had foreseen. The Greek army\r\nhad entered politics and dominated the Government. It caused several\r\nchanges of ministers and forced the King to consent to the summoning of\r\na National Assembly consisting of twice as many delegates as there were\r\nmembers in Parliament. Crete also insisted upon sending delegates, which\r\nwould have been tantamount to incorporating itself as part of Greece\r\npolitically.\r\n\r\nThe Minister of Foreign Affairs frankly told the ambassadors of all the\r\nleading Powers, as well as the Greek minister, that if the Greek\r\nNational Assembly admitted delegates from Crete, Turkey would regard\r\nthat as a _casus belli_. There was a rumor at the same time that\r\nBulgaria was preparing to take advantage of the crisis to make war on\r\nTurkey, either by uniting with Greece or in conjunction with some of the\r\nother Balkan States. The Minister of Foreign Affairs had managed well,\r\nand the four big Powers, England, Russia, France, and Italy, bestirred\r\nthemselves and the situation was allayed for the time.\r\n\r\nGreece had purchased from Italy a man-of-war of about ten thousand tons,\r\nwhich was being fitted and armored for delivery within six months. To\r\noffset this augmentation of the Greek navy, already stronger than the\r\nTurkish, Turkey wanted to purchase a man-of-war of sufficient size to\r\noutclass the one being fitted for Greece. The Minister of Foreign\r\nAffairs called on me with a memorandum of the size of the ship and the\r\nstrength of the armament desired, together with a statement that the\r\nobject of the Ottoman Government in the purchase of it was not to make\r\nwar, but to safeguard the peace of Turkey and possibly of Europe. It was\r\nthought that the moral effect upon Greece of such a purchase would\r\nprevent her from taking any action that would cause war.\r\n\r\nI cabled this proposal in detail to Secretary Knox, and requested a\r\nreply by cable. I knew that we had several ships that would probably\r\nanswer the requirements of Turkey, and I thought that, aside from the\r\nmoral effect this might have in preventing a war between Turkey and\r\nGreece, it would enable us to substitute a new ship of our own for an\r\nold one. It was not a question of price, as Turkey had put aside\r\nsufficient money to pay for such a ship.\r\n\r\nA few days later Chevket Pasha also called on me, and again assured me\r\nthat the purchase was designed to have an immediate effect upon the\r\nmaintenance of peace, and that the people of Turkey would be forever\r\ngrateful to the United States if we should sell them the ship.\r\n\r\nBut after the lapse of a week or more, I finally received a negative\r\nanswer from the State Department, saying that such a sale could not be\r\nmade without the authority of Congress. This, of course, I knew; but\r\nsince the transaction would have given us the opportunity to add a new\r\nship to replace the other, I thought such legislation might readily have\r\nbeen obtained. The Turkish Government then made application to Germany,\r\nand that country seized the opportunity further to cement its friendly\r\nrelations with the Ottoman Empire, which later had such an important\r\nbearing in the World War.\r\n\r\nAbout a year after this Crete affair, Chevket Pasha was assassinated as\r\nhe was coming out of the Sublime Porte. No greater loss could have\r\nbefallen Turkey than the removal at that time of her greatest general\r\nand most enlightened statesman. He was the best-informed Turkish\r\nstatesman I have ever known, with a clear and correct view of the entire\r\nEuropean situation. What the conspiracy was behind this shooting was\r\nnever brought to light.\r\n\r\nThe affairs of Crete at that time were in the hands of the energetic\r\nand brilliant leader who has since come to be regarded as one of the\r\nforemost statesmen of all Europe, Eleutherios Venizelos. At the Paris\r\nPeace Conference his recognition was complete. The Greeks, however, have\r\nalways shown themselves to be a fickle and ungrateful people, and from\r\nthe time of Socrates have turned against their foremost philosophers and\r\nstatesmen, and their attitude toward Venizelos is the most recent\r\nillustration of those traits. Venizelos is practically a refugee from\r\nhis own country and at this writing is visiting our country to study\r\nAmerican institutions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe main reason I accepted the post at Turkey for the third time was to\r\nsecure the legal status and rights of American institutions under\r\ndefinite laws in the new regime. The Turks had promulgated a law, known\r\nas the \"Law of Associations,\" under the ingenious restrictions of which\r\nthey sought to place all foreign institutions. That would have given the\r\nOttoman authorities, both civil and judicial, the power so to impede the\r\nwork of these institutions as to prevent them from functioning. I\r\npointed out to the Grand Vizier that the Law of Associations was\r\ncontrary to the acquired rights of the institutions, which had been\r\nlegally recognized for many years, and taking section by section I\r\nshowed him the inapplicability of it to these institutions. After months\r\nof negotiations, as usual in Turkey, I succeeded in getting a decision\r\nfrom the Council of Ministers exempting foreign institutions of a\r\nreligious, educational, or benevolent character.\r\n\r\nThere were three or four other matters that I succeeded in bringing to a\r\nsuccessful close. Contrary to the real-property laws of 1868, our\r\ninstitutions were being denied the right to hold in their names real\r\nproperty necessary for their operation, and this right I was able to\r\nsecure for them. Among other things I obtained a charter for the Syrian\r\nProtestant College at Beirut, and I got an irade or permit for the\r\nconstruction of new buildings for Robert College. The American College\r\nfor Girls, at Scutari on the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus, wanted to\r\ntransfer the institution over to Arnaoutkeui on the European side, its\r\npresent location, and I secured permission for this transfer and for the\r\nconstruction of its buildings.\r\n\r\nWhile these various negotiations were in progress, I received an\r\ninstruction from Secretary Knox at which I took umbrage. It contained\r\nthe following paragraph: \"If I am correct in understanding that American\r\neducational and missionary interests in Turkey are in fact receiving\r\ntreatment in substance entirely satisfactory, I conclude that the chief\r\ninfluence should at present be centered upon a substantial advancement\r\nof our prestige and commerce.\"\r\n\r\nThis had no other meaning than that instead of vigorous effort for the\r\nprotection of American colleges, schools, and hospitals, whose rights\r\nunder the new regime were being seriously threatened by new laws and\r\nregulations, I was to transfer my efforts to securing shipbuilding and\r\nrailway concessions. I promptly advised the Department that this\r\nunderstanding was not correct, that the interests of our institutions\r\nwere being seriously threatened, and that the proper protection of these\r\ninterests in no way conflicted with the advancement of our commercial\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\nI continued to push the negotiations on behalf of our institutions, for\r\nI knew that a let-up at that time would, instead of benefiting our\r\ncommercial interests, convey the impression of weakness on the part of\r\nour Government in looking out for American interests. In several\r\ndispatches I pointed out to the Department that to exert official\r\npressure for railway concessions in Turkey would likewise require the\r\nprotection of such concessions, when obtained, by strenuous official\r\naction which might at some time even involve the use of force, and could\r\nnot fail to enmesh us in the intricate political problems of the Near\r\nEast. I asked the Department to weigh carefully the possible advantage\r\nof concessions to a few American exploiters, against the serious\r\ndisadvantages that the protection of these concessions would impose. I\r\npointed out that invariably the Turkish Government, of its own accord or\r\nthrough outside pressure, failed to live up to its contracts if not\r\ncompelled to do so, and that the situation would be further complicated\r\nby the conflicting interests of the other Powers whose commercial\r\ndealings were subordinate to their political strategy. To ordinary\r\ncommercial transactions, such as export and import, these risks did not,\r\nof course, apply; but they were particularly troublesome with regard to\r\nthe building and running of railways on Turkish territory.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong our distinguished visitors during this mission were former\r\nVice-President and Mrs. Fairbanks, who were on their tour round the\r\nworld. They were our guests for a week, and we gave a series of dinners\r\nto have them meet the leading diplomatic and Turkish officials. Among\r\nthe latter was Ahmed Riza Bey, president of the Chamber of Deputies, who\r\nhad for twenty years been a refugee in Paris, where he edited a Turkish\r\npaper. He spoke French fluently. He was said to be practically the head\r\nof the Young Turks Party. He was blue-eyed, handsome, and thoroughly\r\nmodern. His father was one of the chamberlains of Sultan Abdul Aziz, and\r\nhis mother, an Austrian, once told Mrs. Straus that she had almost\r\nforgotten the German language because she had not used it in so long a\r\ntime, for she was only seventeen when she was married.\r\n\r\nRiza Bey was very much interested to learn from Mr. Fairbanks the rules\r\nof parliamentary procedure. The Chamber of Deputies had not as yet\r\nadopted any such rules and its proceedings lacked system and order.\r\n\r\nA few days later, while the president of the Chamber was calling on me,\r\nthe palace of the Chamber of Deputies, Tcheragan on the Bosphorus,\r\nburned to the ground,--an unfortunate occurrence not only because of the\r\nmaterial loss, but because it was looked upon by the populace as a\r\nvisitation from God against the new regime.\r\n\r\nJudge and Mrs. Alton B. Parker and the widow of Daniel Manning,\r\nSecretary of the Treasury in Cleveland's second Cabinet, also gave us\r\nthe pleasure of a visit. And a little later Cleveland H. Dodge arrived\r\nin his yacht. He was heartily welcomed by all the missionaries, for he\r\nwas prominently connected with Robert College and was chairman of the\r\nboard of trustees of the College at Beirut. In his party was Mrs. Grover\r\nCleveland.\r\n\r\nAfter we had moved to our summer quarters at Yenikeui, Kermit Roosevelt\r\nand his classmate, John Heard, came to spend about ten days with us. My\r\nson Roger, then a student at Princeton, was spending his vacation with\r\nus and was glad to have the company of two young men of about his own\r\nage.\r\n\r\nAt this time we saw much of Sir William Willcocks, the eminent British\r\nengineer, who had just returned from Bagdad where he was employed by the\r\nTurkish Government in the construction and supervision of irrigation\r\nworks in Mesopotamia. It was he who projected and designed the Assuan\r\nDam across the Nile. He told me he was born to his work, as his father,\r\nCaptain W. Willcocks, was engaged in it in India.\r\n\r\nIn June I wrote the Department of State requesting a leave of absence\r\ntoward the end of September or beginning of October, with permission to\r\nreturn home. In answer I received a cable from the assistant secretary\r\nto the effect that the railway concessions of the Ottoman American\r\nDevelopment Company were to come up in Parliament in November, and\r\nasking if it would be convenient for me to take my leave earlier so as\r\nto be back in Turkey by November 1st. I replied in a confidential letter\r\nthat it was my intention, upon my return to America, to confer with the\r\nPresident and the Secretary of State regarding my release from this\r\npost, in accordance with my understanding when I accepted the\r\nappointment. I decided to wait until the arrival of the new secretary of\r\nthe embassy, Mr. Hoffman Philip, and before leaving I took pains to make\r\nhim thoroughly familiar with the work of the embassy so that no ground\r\nmight be lost pending my resignation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn leaving Constantinople we desired a few days' rest in the mountains.\r\nAt the suggestion, therefore, of our minister to Roumania, J. Ridgely\r\nCarter, we planned to go to Sinaia, the Roumanian summer capital, which\r\nhe thought we should find agreeable in every way, so on September 3d we\r\nleft Turkey for Roumania.\r\n\r\nSinaia we found not only very beautiful, but most enjoyable. We were\r\ninvited to the Palace a number of times. The Court being in mourning,\r\nall entertaining was informal and more intimate. The King reminded me of\r\nthe late Edmund Clarence Stedman in general appearance. The Queen, known\r\nto all the world as \"Carmen Sylva,\" was a striking personality, tall,\r\nrather heavily built, with silver gray hair and a high complexion,\r\nstrong, mobile features, and a very spiritual expression. She spoke\r\nEnglish, French, and German with equal fluency, so that it was difficult\r\nto tell which was the most natural to her.\r\n\r\nThe Queen told me how she happened to choose Carmen Sylva for a\r\npen-name: The woods always appealed to her; their stillness and beauty\r\ninspired her. When she began to publish her work, at the age of\r\nthirty-five, she asked a certain German writer to tell her the Latin\r\nword for \"woods\"; that gave her \"sylva.\" Next she asked the Latin word\r\nfor \"bird,\" but that did not suit her. Then the word for \"song\"\r\nsuggested itself, \"carmen.\" The combination appealed to her poetic\r\nsense, and she adopted it.\r\n\r\nAt luncheon one day our conversation drifted to poetry and American\r\npoets. The Queen seemed to know all our bards, even the minor ones,\r\nseveral of whom I had not heard of myself. I happened to quote, as near\r\nas I could recall it, a couplet from a little poem that Joaquin Miller\r\nwrote when Peter Cooper died:\r\n\r\n              All one can hold in his cold right hand\r\n                     Is what he has given away.\r\n\r\nShe was most enthusiastic about that sentiment and said she considered\r\nit real poetry. She repeated it several times so as to remember it.\r\n\r\n\"Whenever any one gives me a beautiful thought, I never forget him,\" she\r\nsaid, turning to me in her unaffected manner. I appreciated her delicate\r\ncompliment.\r\n\r\nAfter luncheon she invited me to the floor above to see her study. She\r\nexplained that she did her best work in a little cell-like room in the\r\nmonastery below the hill near the Palace, which we had visited the day\r\nbefore. There she was most free from disturbance of any kind. Her study\r\nin the Palace was comfortable and attractively furnished; not large, but\r\ncozy. Looking out of the windows, one saw the terraced Italian gardens\r\nand the wooded peaks of the Carpathian Mountains beyond. The low\r\nbookcases which lined the four walls contained English, French, and\r\nGerman books in exquisite bindings. At her desk were three typewriters,\r\nrespectively from England, France, and Germany, for use in writing the\r\nlanguages of those countries. She used them herself, according to the\r\nlanguage in which the inspiration of the moment had come. She presented\r\nme with a volume of poems and one of essays, both in German, \"Meine\r\nRuhe\" and \"Mein Penatenwinkel,\" which she inscribed for me.\r\n\r\nWe went through the Palace that afternoon. It is modern and very\r\nbeautiful, furnished in excellent taste, and not cold and uncomfortable,\r\nsacrificed to grandeur, as most palaces seem to be. Then the King and\r\nQueen invited us to return the next morning at eleven, to a musicale and\r\nluncheon.\r\n\r\nNext day after luncheon the King left the other guests and took me into\r\na small adjoining room where we smoked and had coffee. Knowing that I\r\nhad been Secretary of Commerce and Labor, he led the conversation to\r\neconomic questions, which he said interested him most. He expressed\r\nsurprise that we had not come to state ownership of railways, which he\r\nbelieved was the only way to regulate them. I explained our method of\r\nregulating them, but he thought that method more socialistic and\r\narbitrary than in his own country. We talked of the Roosevelt policies\r\nand their general aim at social justice. He said he regretted very much\r\nthat Roosevelt had not visited Roumania, for he had the greatest\r\nadmiration for him, both as man and as statesman.\r\n\r\nOur conversation ran on to the Jewish question, and the King spoke most\r\nsympathetically of the Jews, saying that they were patriotic subjects\r\nand good soldiers, that there was no religious prejudice against them,\r\nand that the Jewish question in Roumania was purely economic. The Jews\r\nwho came in from Russia and Poland constituted separate communities in\r\nthe country, with foreign methods of living, foreign language, and\r\nforeign views. I told him that in the most enlightened countries there\r\nwas an absence of the Jewish problem because no problem was created by\r\ntreating the Jews as separate groups with restricted rights. He saw that\r\npoint, but explained that Roumania was right next to Russia where the\r\nJews were most oppressed. If, therefore, Roumania accorded them full\r\nrights, there would be a flood of immigration much larger than they were\r\nthen getting. I pointed out that it would be much better to restrict\r\nimmigration than to restrict the natural rights of the Jews of Roumania.\r\nThat thought impressed him, and he said he realized that, under the\r\nsystem they then had, much injustice was done which brought disgrace to\r\nthe kingdom, but he hoped a remedy would be worked out.\r\n\r\nWe spoke of the United States Postal Savings legislation, of which he\r\nrequested an outline, and thought it could be adopted by Roumania with\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nA few days later we again lunched with the King and Queen. The Queen\r\nmentioned the bit of poetry I had given her a few days before and asked\r\nwhether I could give her another. Something had been said about Hay's\r\nRoumanian note that brought to mind the last stanza of Hay's hymn:\r\n\r\n  Wherever man oppresses man,\r\n    Beneath the setting sun,\r\n  O Lord, be there, thine arm make bare,\r\n    Thy righteous will be done.\r\n\r\nThe Queen admired these lines and begged me to write them out, which I\r\ndid on the back of one of my visiting-cards. She put the card in her\r\nreticule, saying that the lines would inspire a poem some day, and that\r\nshe would then send it to me.\r\n\r\nReferring to her work generally, she spoke of her indebtedness to\r\nProfessor Michael Bernays, the distinguished Jewish scholar, who was a\r\nfrequent and welcome visitor at the home of her parents. She said he was\r\nthe most modest and intellectual person she had ever known, and his\r\nconversations and teachings had greatly influenced her intellectual and\r\nspiritual life. She asked me to read her estimate of this wonderful man\r\nin her book of essays that she had given me. I have since read it\r\nseveral times, and it would surprise many to read such a eulogy and\r\nvindication of the Jews and Judaism by the Queen of a country where the\r\nJews were so sorely oppressed by drastic discrimination.\r\n\r\nBefore we left Sinaia, the Queen sent me a large photograph of herself,\r\ninscribed: \"Never mind deep waters, there are pearls to be found.\r\nElizabeth. Sinaia, September, 1910.\"\r\n\r\nIn Vienna, we were guests at a tea given by Dr. Sigmund Muenz, of \"Die\r\nNeue Freie Presse.\" Among those present was Baroness Bertha von Suttner,\r\nthe great peace advocate and authoress of \"Down With Your Arms,\" who had\r\nreceived the Nobel Peace Prize the previous year. I had met her before\r\nin the United States, where we spoke from the same platform during the\r\nsessions of the Interparliamentary Union and the International Peace\r\nSocieties.\r\n\r\nNext we went to London, where we enjoyed the pleasant hospitalities of\r\nour ambassador, Whitelaw Reid. At one of the luncheons at the embassy I\r\nwas pleased to make the acquaintance of Dr. Luis M. Drago, the Argentine\r\ninternational jurist and author of the Drago Doctrine, who had just\r\nreturned from the Anglo-American Fisheries Arbitration at The Hague.\r\n\r\nWe dined one evening with the Right Honorable Sir Ernest Cassel at his\r\ncharming home, Brooke House, and afterward went with him to the theater.\r\nSir Ernest, one of England's leading financiers, was constantly being\r\nreferred to in the press in connection with the negotiations pending in\r\nParis for a new loan to the Turks. He told us that these international\r\nfinancial negotiations, because of their international importance, did\r\nnot appeal to him, for he had no ambition to be in the limelight or to\r\nbecome a conspicuous international personage. He preferred quiet and\r\nobscurity, for constant publicity disturbed his peace of mind. This\r\nattitude was not one of assumed modesty; he really said what he meant\r\nand felt.\r\n\r\nOn another evening we dined with Postmaster-General Herbert Samuel and\r\nhis wife. Mr. Samuel was only thirty-nine years old and gave every\r\npromise of the distinction which he has since attained in the service of\r\nhis country. At this writing he is British High Commissioner in\r\nPalestine.\r\n\r\nLord Rothschild had written me to call on him when in London; and I went\r\nto the banking house to see him. In speaking of the Triple Entente of\r\nGreat Britain, France, and Russia, I told him I thought that, from a\r\nBritish point of view, it was unwise. He, on the other hand, regarded it\r\nas good because it offered the best security for peace. A few days\r\nthereafter I mentioned the subject to his brother, Alfred. The latter\r\nsaid that he and his brother usually agreed, but in this matter they\r\ntook opposite views. Alfred considered it a great mistake, from the\r\npoint of view of civilization, for England to be aligned with Russia,\r\nand beyond that he considered it detrimental to the relationship between\r\nEngland and Germany, which was none too friendly. In the light of all\r\nthat has since taken place, it is interesting to note how the\r\ninternational alignment of 1910 was reflected in the minds of these big\r\ninternational financiers.\r\n\r\nOn September 8th we boarded the Lusitania at Liverpool, reaching New\r\nYork on the 13th. My brother Isidor and our children met us, and we were\r\nmade to appreciate the real truth of the bull that \"the greatest\r\npleasure in going abroad is returning home.\"\r\n\r\nSoon afterward I went to Washington. First I called at the State\r\nDepartment and had an informal talk with Secretary Knox. I told him I\r\ndid not wish to return to Turkey. The important negotiations had been\r\nbrought to a favorable conclusion, and I felt that I had spent enough of\r\nmy time there. He referred to the understanding with which I had\r\naccepted the post, that when I desired to be relieved, another post that\r\nmight be available and acceptable to me would be tendered me. However, I\r\npurposely did not comment on this understanding. I simply said that I\r\ndid not wish to cause the Administration any embarrassment, and was\r\ncontent to stay at home. He said he would have a talk with the President\r\nand confer with me later.\r\n\r\nWhen I called on the President, I told him that since all the questions\r\nfor which I went to Turkey had been adjusted, I did not wish to return.\r\nSubsequently I received a very cordial and complimentary letter from\r\nhim, but, as it contained no intimation of his earlier promise to\r\ntransfer me to a post more to my liking, I did not refer to it. The rift\r\nbetween the Roosevelt policies and the Taft Administration had by this\r\ntime grown considerably, and I was known to be in thorough accord with\r\nRoosevelt and his policies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE PROGRESSIVES\r\n\r\n     The Progressive spirit is kindled and shaped into a cause--My\r\n     speech at the banquet of the New York Chamber of Commerce in\r\n     1910--Roosevelt's hostility to boss rule--Liberals impatient with\r\n     Taft Administration--Governors demand Roosevelt--He advocates\r\n     recall of judicial decisions--This stand believed to have caused\r\n     his defeat--New York State Progressive Convention is\r\n     deadlocked--\"Suspender Jack\" nominates me for Governor and\r\n     stampedes convention--I decline to consider Republican\r\n     nomination--Sulzer's \"non-Jewish but pro-Jewish\" slogan--I stump\r\n     the State--Bainbridge Colby \"impersonates\" me--Roosevelt, shot by a\r\n     lunatic, heroically addresses Milwaukee mass meeting--I am needed\r\n     in national campaign--The dramatic Roosevelt speech in Madison\r\n     Square Garden--His tribute to me--Election returns--Progressives\r\n     poorly organized--Their cause a crusade.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the torrential flood of American politics, two main currents are\r\ncontinuously perceptible. There are, of course, innumerable permanent\r\nand temporary cross-currents, eddies, and other variations, but the two\r\nmain currents are ever present. One may be generally described as\r\nprofessional, mechanical, and ruled by the accomplished and consummate\r\nselfishness of invisible forces. The other, while more genuine in\r\nspirit, is often amateurish in effort; it is more spontaneous; it is\r\nkindled by emotions of revolt; it sees mankind not as masses to be\r\nexploited, and profited by, but as individuals to be set freer to\r\nexpress themselves socially and economically. It strives to restate the\r\nbetter aspirations of men generally, and to mitigate some of the\r\npressure that civilization imposes upon them.\r\n\r\nIt is not the province of the historian to moralize. It is his business\r\nto trace the changing currents of human thought and to produce accurate\r\npictures of men in action. And so, in touching on the Progressives, I\r\nshall endeavor to give some indication of the mental processes that\r\nshaped their cause, and to depict some of the dramatic scenes that\r\ncarried their cause into action. Many of these scenes I was able to\r\nobserve closely. In a sense, I may have figured more definitely than I\r\nrealized at the time, in kindling their cause into smoke and flame.\r\n\r\nOn November 17, 1910, the New York Chamber of Commerce held its one\r\nhundred and forty-second annual banquet at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.\r\nThe speakers were Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, of Massachusetts; Governor\r\nHorace White, of New York; Mayor William J. Gaynor, of New York City;\r\nand myself. The president of the Chamber, the late A. Barton Hepburn,\r\npresided. My subject was \"American Prestige,\" and I could not refrain\r\nfrom referring to the great extent to which American influence and\r\nprestige had been advanced by Roosevelt, both as President and during\r\nhis tour through Europe. There was instant and prolonged applause at the\r\nmention of Roosevelt's name, clearly showing that his political\r\ninfluence was not dead, contrary to the ideas of many who thought so\r\nbecause the election of a few days before had shown sweeping Democratic\r\ngains and the defeat of Roosevelt's candidate for Governor, Henry L.\r\nStimson. When the banquet was over, Senator Lodge said to me that if the\r\npolitical opponents of Roosevelt could have seen the enthusiasm with\r\nwhich his name was applauded, they would realize that even in New York\r\nhe was as much alive as ever.\r\n\r\nWhen I had met Roosevelt in Cairo on his way back from Africa, we had\r\ntalked frequently about politics at home. It was clear to me from his\r\nconversation that he did not propose to be enticed or forced into\r\naccepting any nomination, although there was talk, yes, I may say a\r\ndemand, that he reenter public life as either Governor of New York or\r\nUnited States Senator.\r\n\r\nRoosevelt was so loyal a Republican that his opponents constantly chided\r\nhim for going along with the bosses, like Senator Platt, for instance,\r\nand at the same time advocating reforms. He used to reply that he did\r\nand would continue to cooperate with the bosses so long as they went his\r\nway. His aim from the time he entered public life as a member of the New\r\nYork State Assembly was to make the party always more responsive to its\r\nhighest ideals; and from the beginning he worked against the \"invisible\r\npowers\" or boss rule. By word and deed all through his life he showed an\r\nindependence and moral courage that careless observers might often have\r\nmistaken for headlong impetuosity. No one could know him without\r\nrecognizing that he was broad-minded, liberal, and inherently\r\nprogressive.\r\n\r\nWhen he arrived home from abroad in June, 1910, he found the Republican\r\nParty disrupted. The dissatisfaction and impatience of the liberals was\r\ndistinctly evident. By 1912 Taft had allowed himself to become so\r\nthoroughly identified with the reactionaries that the large independent\r\nelement had not only become unenthusiastic, but decidedly hostile to the\r\nAdministration. In his Winona speech President Taft had ranked himself\r\non the side of those leaders in the party who opposed real tariff\r\nreform. In his famous Norton letter he had even gone so far as to imply,\r\nif not to expressly admit, that federal Patronage had been used against\r\nthe Progressives in Congress.\r\n\r\nThe Progressive element both in and out of Congress was therefore\r\ncasting about for a candidate who represented the liberal wing of the\r\nparty, for nomination at the National Republican Convention at Chicago\r\nin June. Roosevelt's office at \"The Outlook\" was daily crowded with\r\nliberal leaders who had come to consult with him and to urge him to\r\n\"throw his hat in the ring,\" to use one of Roosevelt's own picturesque\r\nexpressions. This demand grew and spread until finally came the\r\nfollowing appeal from the Governors of the States of Kansas, Michigan,\r\nMissouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, West Virginia, and Wyoming:\r\n\r\n     We feel that you will be unresponsive to a plain public duty if you\r\n     decline to accept the nomination coming as the voluntary expression\r\n     of the wishes of a majority of the Republican voters of the United\r\n     States through the action of their delegates in the next National\r\n     Convention.\r\n\r\nTo this message Roosevelt replied:\r\n\r\n     One of the chief principles for which I have stood and for which I\r\n     now stand, and which I have always endeavoured and always shall\r\n     endeavour to reduce to action, is the genuine rule of the people;\r\n     and, therefore, I hope that so far as possible the people may be\r\n     given the chance, through direct primaries, to express their\r\n     preference as to who shall be the nominee of the Republican\r\n     Presidential Convention.\r\n\r\nDuring this period I called on Roosevelt one day at the offices of \"The\r\nOutlook,\" and he handed me the galley-proof of a speech he was to make\r\nbefore the Constitutional Convention at Columbus, Ohio. He called it\r\n\"The Charter of Democracy.\" His room was full of callers, so I went into\r\nDr. Abbott's office and there carefully read the speech. In it Roosevelt\r\nadvocated, among other reforms such as the short ballot and the\r\ninitiative and referendum, the recall of judicial decisions. When I came\r\nto that subject I confess I was shocked, and so expressed myself to one\r\nof the editors of \"The Outlook\"; as I remember it, it was Dr. Abbott\r\nhimself. Compelled to keep another appointment, I left the office when I\r\nhad finished reading the speech, saying that I should return later.\r\n\r\nUpon my return I met Roosevelt just as he was going out to keep an\r\nengagement.\r\n\r\n\"I hear you don't like my speech,\" he said to me.\r\n\r\n\"I like your speech; I think it is fine; all but that portion of it\r\nwhich refers to the recall of judicial decisions,\" I answered. I started\r\nto give my reasons, but seeing that he was pressed for time, I said: \"I\r\nshould like to discuss that matter with you, provided your mind is open\r\non the subject.\" To my great surprise he said that he had thought the\r\nsubject over very carefully, and frankly told me that he had come to a\r\ndefinite decision on it.\r\n\r\nThat was so unlike the Roosevelt I knew in the many discussions I had\r\nhad with him, when invariably I found his mind responsive, that I was\r\nquite disappointed and somewhat taken back. But I did not want him to\r\nfeel that I had joined the ranks of the many who had parted political\r\ncompany with him because he had made it known that he would accept\r\nanother nomination for President, and so, on reaching my office, I wrote\r\nhim a letter, briefly explaining why I objected to his statements\r\nregarding the recall of judicial decisions. I assured him that on that\r\naccount I did not part from him politically, for after all I agreed with\r\nhim more than with any other candidate who might possibly be named.\r\n\r\nThe birth and development of the Progressive Party is, of course, an\r\nelement of national history that has often been detailed. William Draper\r\nLewis, in his \"Life of Theodore Roosevelt,\" and Lawrence F. Abbott, in\r\nhis \"Impressions of Theodore Roosevelt,\" both give clear accounts of it.\r\nRoosevelt's candidacy and defeat have been variously analyzed, but I\r\nbelieve now, as I believed in 1912, that but for this unfortunate\r\nstatement regarding judicial decisions, Roosevelt would have been\r\nre-elected President in 1912. It is true that he afterwards clarified\r\nthe meaning of his use of the word \"recall\"; that its application was\r\nlimited to such decisions as held legislative acts unconstitutional, and\r\nthat such decisions might at the following election be submitted to\r\npopular vote, in accordance with the method employed by a State for the\r\nadoption of its constitution. But his clarification never overcame the\r\neffects of the Columbus speech. William Draper Lewis, who was one of\r\nRoosevelt's closest advisers at the time, says in his biography:\r\n\r\n     Looking back now over the events leading up to the Republican\r\n     National Convention of 1912, it would appear almost certain that\r\n     had he, in his address before the Ohio Convention, either refrained\r\n     from making the proposal or had he called it a new method of\r\n     amending the constitution, and carefully explained it so that it\r\n     could not have been misunderstood, it is most probable that he\r\n     would have been nominated at Chicago, and that the whole course of\r\n     the recent history of the United States would have been other than\r\n     it has been.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NATHAN, OSCAR, AND ISIDOR STRAUS\r\n\r\n1912]\r\n\r\nShortly after the Columbus speech, Roosevelt delivered, on March 20,\r\n1912, at Carnegie Hall, New York, what was in many respects the most\r\nforceful and eloquent address I ever heard him make. He graphically\r\ndescribed his dedication to his ideals of democracy:\r\n\r\n     Our task as Americans is to strive for social and industrial\r\n     justice, achieved through the genuine rule of the people. This is\r\n     our end, our purpose. The methods for achieving the end are merely\r\n     expedients, to be finally accepted or rejected according as actual\r\n     experience shows that they work well or ill. But in our hearts we\r\n     must have this lofty purpose, and we must strive for it in all\r\n     earnestness and sincerity, or our work will come to nothing. In\r\n     order to succeed, we need leaders of inspired idealism, leaders to\r\n     whom are granted great visions, who dream greatly and strive to\r\n     make their dreams come true; who can kindle the people with the\r\n     fire from their own burning souls.\r\n\r\n     The leader for the time being, whoever he may be, is but an\r\n     instrument, to be used until broken and then to be cast aside; and\r\n     if he is worth his salt, he will care no more when he is broken\r\n     than a soldier cares when he is sent where his life is forfeit in\r\n     order that the victory may be won.\r\n\r\n     If on this new continent we merely build another country of great\r\n     but unjustly divided material prosperity, we shall have done\r\n     nothing; and we shall do as little if we merely set the greed of\r\n     envy against the greed of arrogance, and thereby destroy the\r\n     material well-being of all of us. To turn this government into\r\n     government by plutocracy or government by a mob would be to repeat\r\n     on a larger scale the lamentable failures of the world that is\r\n     dead. We stand against all tyranny, by the few or by the many. We\r\n     stand for the rule of the many in the interest of all of us, for\r\n     the rule of the many in the spirit of courage, of common sense, of\r\n     high purpose, above all, in a spirit of kindly justice towards\r\n     every man and every woman.\r\n\r\nA month after the meeting of the National Convention of the Progressive\r\nParty, popularly called the \"Bull Moose Convention,\" which nominated\r\nTheodore Roosevelt for President and Hiram W. Johnson for\r\nVice-President, the New York State Convention of the Progressive Party\r\nmet at Syracuse, in the Arena. The convention met on September 5th.\r\n\r\nAll during the first day and night, amid lively discussion as to the\r\nselection of candidates for Governor, committees urged me for permission\r\nto present my name as a candidate; but I steadfastly declined, since the\r\ngovernorship, being so largely a political office, did not appeal to me.\r\nI was neither by training nor by temperament a politician, although I\r\nhad taken active part in campaigns for many years, both local and\r\nnational. The next day I was asked to take the permanent chairmanship of\r\nthe convention. This I was willing and glad to do; I wanted to be of\r\nservice to the party; also it was a foregone conclusion that acceptance\r\nof the chairmanship would preclude my being considered a candidate for\r\nthe nomination for Governor.\r\n\r\nThe Arena was filled with about seven thousand delegates and members of\r\nthe new Progressive Party. The air was surcharged with the spirit of the\r\nnew movement--the genuine enthusiasm of men and women of character and\r\nstanding from every county in the State, and among them a great many\r\nministers, professors, reformers, and leaders of benevolent and\r\ncharitable movements. There was a conspicuous absence of the\r\nprofessional politician. Indeed, that convention had more the character\r\nof a town meeting than of a cut-and-dried political convention. Instead\r\nof having decisions made for them, this great body of enthusiasts were\r\ncalled upon to make their own. The candidates had not even been agreed\r\nupon.\r\n\r\nOn September 6th I took my gavel in hand and called the meeting to\r\norder. The first business before the convention was the nomination of a\r\ncandidate for Governor. The secretary called the counties of the State\r\nin alphabetical order, and the chairman of each delegation made his\r\nnomination. The outstanding candidates for nomination were William H.\r\nHotchkiss, one of the organizers of the Progressive Party and chairman\r\nof the National Committee, and William A. Prendergast, comptroller of\r\nthe City of New York, who had made the speech nominating Roosevelt for\r\nPresident at the Chicago Convention. A deadlock between these two\r\ncandidates ensued.\r\n\r\nAfter Yates County had been heard from, a tall, gaunt young man towered\r\nto his feet and asked to be heard; he was from the Fifteenth Manhattan\r\nDistrict, and he had a nomination to make. It was not quite in order,\r\nthough the spirit of the convention was to give each man a chance. While\r\nI was hesitating about recognizing him, there seemed to be a general\r\ndesire that he be given an opportunity to speak, so I gave him five\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nHe looked fantastic as he strode to the platform and faced the audience.\r\nHis manner was somewhat bizarre. He burst forth in dramatic fashion as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     Fellow citizens, ladies and gentlemen: I have just come down from\r\n     Vermont. I ask you people at this convention to make no mistake.\r\n\r\n     We want to put a man up for Governor that no man will be afraid to\r\n     cast his vote for, against whom there can be no charge leveled of\r\n     misconduct of any kind, one who can sweep the State from Montauk\r\n     Point to Lake Erie, and carry every man of every race, religion,\r\n     and creed; a man whose name is known throughout the civilized\r\n     world; a man the mention of whose name brings a tear of sympathy to\r\n     the eye of almost every man and woman in the civilized land; a man\r\n     whose name, wherever men are found with red blood in their veins,\r\n     irrespective of race, religion, and creed, will be carried\r\n     thundering throughout the State to victory.\r\n\r\n     There is no chance for defeat with this man at the head of the\r\n     ticket--\r\n\r\n\"Who is your candidate?\" cried impatient listeners.\r\n\r\n\"What's his name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Name your candidate!\"\r\n\r\nIn sudden answer to these cries from the convention, the speaker\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n     I nominate the illustrious and honorable Oscar S. Straus.\r\n\r\nDuring the long, terrific applause that followed, the delegate stood\r\nawkwardly waiting for a chance to finish. Finally he went on:\r\n\r\n     We should take no chances in this fight. I could not say one\r\n     undeserved word if I used the entire dictionary in praise of the\r\n     other nominees, Mr. Hotchkiss and Mr. Prendergast; but, gentlemen,\r\n     Mr. Prendergast or Mr. Hotchkiss would cause friction in the State.\r\n     We want no friction in this election. We want success and victory.\r\n\r\n     Gentlemen, there is not a newspaper editor in the State of New York\r\n     that would any more assassinate the character of Oscar S. Straus\r\n     than he would assassinate the character of his own mother.\r\n\r\n     Gentlemen, remember! Remember that Rome was saved by the cackle of\r\n     geese. I have no political prestige, but I warn and charge you, put\r\n     up a man for candidate for governor who cannot and will not be\r\n     defeated.\r\n\r\n     Gentlemen, gentlemen, heed me! Make no mistake about Oscar S.\r\n     Straus. You will make no mistake in putting him up as your\r\n     candidate, and you will capture victory and success. No man has had\r\n     better distinction at home and abroad than Mr. Straus. I ask you to\r\n     vote for him.\r\n\r\nThe moment he finished, a stampede started. The entire hall assumed the\r\naspect of a good-natured bedlam. There was cheering and applause, and\r\nmany of the delegates began marching round that big auditorium,\r\nbrandishing the banners of their counties, singing \"The Battle Hymn of\r\nthe Republic\" and \"Onward, Christian Soldiers,\" and breaking out in the\r\nend with \"Straus! Straus! We want Straus!\"\r\n\r\nI pounded the desk with the gavel, I shook my head in the negative, but\r\nto no avail. The noise lasted fully twenty minutes.\r\n\r\nThe picturesque young man who had precipitated this scene was John G.\r\nMcGee, known among his colleagues as \"Suspender Jack.\" He had been a\r\nmember of the mounted police of New York City.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Mr. Hotchkiss and several other leaders came to the platform\r\nand insisted upon my accepting. They even brought Mrs. Straus up with\r\nthe hope of getting her to exert her persuasive powers. There was no\r\nalternative; I had to accept.\r\n\r\nMr. Hotchkiss announced my acceptance, and immediately former\r\nLieutenant-Governor Timothy L. Woodruff announced the withdrawal of Mr.\r\nPrendergast and moved to make the nomination unanimous by acclamation.\r\nThat produced more shouting and cheering, accompanied by much applause\r\nand the waving of banners. It was a touching manifestation and an\r\nunexpected honor. I made a brief speech of acceptance, during which I\r\nfound it difficult to hide the effect of all this demonstration. And\r\nwith more applause and cheering, the session closed with the singing of\r\n\"The Star-Spangled Banner.\"\r\n\r\nThe next morning the convention named for Lieutenant-Governor Frederick\r\nM. Davenport, who was Professor of Law and Politics at Hamilton College\r\nand had made an admirable record in the State Legislature. The ticket\r\nwas then quickly completed and the convention closed.\r\n\r\nThe nominations were received with great favor all through the State and\r\nin the press. Roosevelt at the time was in the Far West conducting his\r\nown campaign, and wrote me from Spokane as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       THE SPOKANE\r\n                                                   SPOKANE, WASHINGTON\r\n                                                   _September 8, 1912_\r\n\r\n     DEAR STRAUS:\r\n\r\n     When I left New York I had expected Prendergast to be nominated and\r\n     there were certain reasons, which I think you know, why I felt\r\n     that, as a matter of principle, his nomination should be made.\r\n\r\n     But there was a still further principle involved, and that was that\r\n     in this Convention the people should have their own way; and, upon\r\n     my word, I am inclined to think that it was a new illustration of\r\n     the fact that the wisdom of _all_ of us is better than the wisdom\r\n     of any of us. Having in view the effect, not only in New York but\r\n     the country at large, I think that your nomination stands second\r\n     only to that of Hiram Johnson as Vice-President, from the\r\n     standpoint of strengthening the ticket. If the only result of the\r\n     next election were to place you in as Governor of New York, I\r\n     should be inclined to think that the Progressive Party had\r\n     justified itself.\r\n\r\n     My dear fellow, I am overjoyed; I congratulate you with all my\r\n     heart. Give my love to dear Mrs. Straus and to Roger and your two\r\n     daughters and all the grandchildren.\r\n\r\n                                        Ever yours\r\n                                                  THEODORE ROOSEVELT\r\n\r\nA few days thereafter he gave out the following interview:\r\n\r\n     Next in importance to the nomination of the Vice-President is the\r\n     nomination for Governor of New York. And it seems to me that Hiram\r\n     Johnson and Oscar Straus symbolize what this movement stands for.\r\n     One is an ex-Republican, the other an ex-Democrat; they both stand\r\n     for what is highest in American citizenship.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Straus is not merely a high-minded and able man, a man of\r\n     incorruptible integrity and great ability, but also a man who has\r\n     kept abreast of the great movement from which sprang the\r\n     Progressive Party. He is eminently fitted to be one of the leaders\r\n     in this movement. On every point of our platform he represents an\r\n     intense earnestness of conviction for all the things for which we\r\n     stand. His attitude toward business, his attitude toward the\r\n     complicated, and the vitally important social and economic problems\r\n     which are dealt with in our plank concerning social and industrial\r\n     justice; in short, his whole position on governmental matters has\r\n     been such as to warrant our saying that he is already in practice\r\n     applying the very principles which we preach.\r\n\r\n     New York State has a right to be proud of the fact that in this\r\n     first State Convention of the people themselves Mr. Straus's\r\n     nomination was, in the most emphatic sense, a nomination by the\r\n     people themselves, a nomination representing the desire of the\r\n     people to have the very best man take the office, although that man\r\n     was himself sincerely desirous to escape having to take it.\r\n\r\n     I have known Mr. Straus intimately ever since I was Governor of New\r\n     York. When he was in my Cabinet I leaned much upon him, and a more\r\n     loyal and disinterested friend no man could have, and, what is\r\n     more important, no man could have a more loyal, disinterested, and\r\n     sanely zealous supporter. As head of the Department of Commerce and\r\n     Labor Mr. Straus himself, by study and administration of the law,\r\n     was one of those who reached conclusions as to the needs of our\r\n     handling of the anti-trust and interstate commerce and similar\r\n     laws, which I set forth in message after message to Congress, and\r\n     which were substantially embodied in the Progressive platform; and\r\n     in his attitude toward labor, toward immigration, toward the duty\r\n     both of public and private employees, he foreshadowed that part of\r\n     the Progressive platform which has dealt with these same matters.\r\n\r\n     Moreover, by his disinterestedness, his unselfish devotion to the\r\n     cause of good government and of sound progressive doctrine for\r\n     economic and social reform, and by his willingness personally to\r\n     sacrifice his own interests to those of the cause he espouses, he\r\n     is, I am happy to say, typical of all men who are in the new\r\n     movement.\r\n\r\n     Exactly as it is a real sacrifice for Hiram Johnson to accept the\r\n     nomination for Vice-President, so it is a real sacrifice for Oscar\r\n     Straus to accept the nomination for Governor of New York. Each has\r\n     accepted because he is not thinking of himself. He is thinking of\r\n     his duty to the people as a whole; of his duty to the great Nation\r\n     to which he belongs. Oscar Straus's nomination is not only a most\r\n     fortunate thing for the New York Progressives, but it is also a\r\n     piece of real good fortune for the Progressive movement throughout\r\n     this Nation.\r\n\r\nWhen the Republicans had their convention at Saratoga a short while\r\nafter my nomination at Syracuse, several of their prominent State\r\nleaders telegraphed me to inquire whether I would accept the Republican\r\nnomination. They feared that with three candidates in the field the\r\nState would go Democratic. One of my managers favored my acceptance,\r\nwhich would without doubt have meant election. But my chief adviser,\r\nChairman Hotchkiss, agreed with me that my accepting the Republican\r\nnomination, without the endorsement by the Republicans of the\r\nProgressive platform, would destroy the Progressive Party in the State,\r\nif not throughout the country. I therefore sent an immediate reply that\r\nwhile I should welcome the support of any group or party that chose to\r\ngive it, I could not accept a nomination that did not mean an\r\nendorsement and acceptance of the platform on which I stood. On hearing\r\nof this, Roosevelt telegraphed me from Memphis: \"Three cheers for you.\r\nYou are a perfect trump and you always do the right thing.\"\r\n\r\nThe Republican candidate was Job E. Hedges, a brilliant member of the\r\nNew York Bar. The Democrats nominated William Sulzer, and Tammany Hall\r\nsanctioned the selection because he was considered a good opponent who\r\nwould attract the Jewish vote. But our politicians make no greater\r\nmistake than to believe that there is such a thing as a Jewish group\r\nvote. Of course, a candidate who by word or action has shown prejudice\r\nagainst or hostility toward the Jews could not expect their suffrage;\r\nbut beyond that the Jews are not controllable as a group at the polls.\r\nHowever, as chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House,\r\nSulzer had taken a prominent part in the abrogation of our treaty with\r\nRussia, and during the campaign the slogan, \"non-Jewish but pro-Jewish,\"\r\nwas designed to bring him the support of the mass of Jewish voters in\r\naddition to the regular Democratic vote.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the whole the campaign was conducted with dignity on all sides. There\r\nwas a noticeable absence of vilification of candidates and general\r\nmud-slinging between the camps, as is too often the case in keenly\r\ncontested elections. My campaign managers arranged for me to make\r\naddresses in every county and almost every city throughout the State. I\r\nhad a special car in which traveled, besides Mr. Davenport, my wife and\r\nme, and several other speakers, a dozen or more reporters from the\r\nleading papers.\r\n\r\nI made my first speech in Getty Square, Yonkers, and from there I\r\ntraveled for seven weeks, making ten to fifteen speeches every day\r\nexcept Sundays, including short talks at stations and from the rear\r\nplatform of my car. Sometimes I made speeches before breakfast, to\r\ncrowds that had gathered at the station, and there were always two or\r\nthree, and often more, formal addresses a day in some public hall, to\r\nwhich I would be escorted from the train with a band of music, and\r\nsometimes with a fife and drum corps, invariably playing \"Onward,\r\nChristian Soldiers.\" So many clergymen took part in the campaign that\r\nfrequently the meetings were opened with a prayer. Many of the meetings\r\nwere spontaneous, emphasizing the crusading spirit which was so\r\ncharacteristic of the campaign.\r\n\r\nOne of my slogans was that I was the \"unbossed candidate of the unbossed\r\npeople.\" One day up in the northern part of the State I was speaking on\r\na raised platform in the open, and, as usual, my time was limited by the\r\ntrain schedule. A member of the committee told my wife, who was sitting\r\nbehind me, that the train would leave in a few minutes, and that it was\r\ntime for me to stop, and just as I got to the middle of the phrase,\r\n\"unbossed candidate--\" she pulled my coat-tail as a signal for me to\r\nstop. At that moment I was quite evidently not the \"unbossed candidate\"\r\nthat I professed to be, and the audience laughed and cheered with\r\namusement. I think that bit of bossing, however, did not cost me any\r\nvotes.\r\n\r\nMr. Davenport proved himself a most effective campaign speaker. Another\r\neffective orator in our party for a short time was Bainbridge Colby, who\r\ndischarged with great distinction the important duties of Secretary of\r\nState during the last year of the Wilson Administration. At Oneonta and\r\nat one or two other places, while I was taking a much-needed rest, the\r\ncrowds had gathered and were calling for me. Mr. Colby, without being\r\nintroduced, responded for me, and the audiences were left with the\r\nimpression that they had listened to me. My cause certainly did not\r\nsuffer by my being so admirably represented, or perhaps I should say\r\nadvantageously misrepresented.\r\n\r\nRoosevelt in the meantime had flung himself into the campaign with all\r\nthe force of his tremendous vigor and energy, and gave to it a dynamic\r\nimpulse that grew in intensity as he progressed through the country. He\r\nwent out to the Pacific Coast, returned through the Southern States to\r\nNew York City, speaking at every important center. In September he went\r\nthrough New England. In October he started on his final tour through the\r\nMiddle West, and it was while on this trip that he was shot by a lunatic\r\njust as he was leaving his hotel to make a speech in the Auditorium in\r\nMilwaukee. The incident, tragic in itself, was made dramatic by his\r\nheroism. With the bullet in his breast and his clothes soaked with\r\nblood, disregarding the entreaties of his companions, he went on to the\r\nAuditorium and spoke for more than an hour. To him nothing counted\r\nexcept the triumph of the principles for which he was fighting.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this accident the national managers had me leave the\r\nState of New York and take up the national campaign, which I did\r\ncheerfully. No one, of course, could fill Roosevelt's engagements, but\r\nthe plan was to rescue the cause so far as possible, and I spoke in\r\nseveral of the larger cities where meetings had been scheduled for\r\nRoosevelt, principally Chicago, Cincinnati, and Cleveland. My intense\r\nanxiety regarding the condition of my chief during this time was greatly\r\nrelieved by assuring telegrams from Mrs. Roosevelt and his nephew,\r\nGeorge Emlen Roosevelt, who were both at his side.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTwo final rallies were arranged in Madison Square Garden, New York--one\r\non Wednesday, October 30th, for the national ticket, and the second on\r\nFriday, November 1st, for the State ticket. Roosevelt, though not well,\r\nconsidered himself sufficiently recovered to appear. His physicians,\r\nDoctors Lambert and Brewer, had prescribed no more campaign speeches, in\r\nfact, did not want him to go to these meetings; but he brushed aside\r\ntheir injunctions and left Oyster Bay for Madison Square.\r\n\r\nHis presence at the national rally was his first public appearance since\r\nthe shooting, and keyed-up the meeting to a high dramatic pitch. Fully\r\neighteen thousand persons were in the auditorium and a few thousand more\r\nwere outside clamoring for admission. When Roosevelt appeared on the\r\nplatform, a roar of applause broke loose and continued for forty-five\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nRoosevelt's speech, characteristically, was confined to a plea for the\r\nProgressive cause and for the State ticket; no word for himself. He\r\nappeared in good form and to possess his usual vigor, although it was\r\nobserved that he did not use his right arm. His speech was earnest,\r\ncalm, and exalted, closing with what he called his political creed:\r\n\r\n     I am glad beyond measure that I am one of the many who in this\r\n     fight have stood ready to spend and be spent, pledged to fight\r\n     while life lasts the great fight for righteousness and for\r\n     brotherhood and for the welfare of mankind.\r\n\r\nAt the rally for the State ticket two nights later the crowd inside the\r\nGarden was as large as at the national rally, though there were fewer\r\npeople outside. The enthusiasm was at the same high pitch. When I arose\r\nto speak, the cheering began and lasted twenty-seven minutes before it\r\ncould be checked. Roosevelt was expected during the evening. His\r\nphysicians had reminded him when he started from home that he had\r\npromised not to speak any more in the campaign, to which he humorously\r\nreplied that he had promised not to speak for himself, but that this\r\ntime he would talk for Oscar Straus and Fred Davenport and the\r\ncandidates on the judiciary ticket!\r\n\r\nAt the close of my thirty-minute address, Roosevelt appeared. The crowd\r\nwent wild, and stopped cheering only when Mr. Hotchkiss, who was\r\npresiding, besought them to stop out of consideration for the Colonel.\r\nRoosevelt spoke for an hour and held that vast audience in rapt\r\nattention. He devoted the first half of his speech to outlining the\r\nProgressive cause, its meaning and purpose, and the second half to\r\nadvocating the State ticket. He referred to my public career in terms of\r\nunmeasured praise, beginning with my first mission to Turkey. He told\r\nthe crowd that everywhere he spoke, from the Great Lakes to the Gulf and\r\nfrom the Atlantic to the Pacific, he had \"found that the name of Oscar\r\nStraus was a name with which to conjure,\" and that it \"helped the\r\nProgressive cause in California and in New Mexico, in Illinois and in\r\nKansas, that we here in New York had named such a man as our candidate\r\nfor Governor.\" He then gave accounts of the personal services and\r\nqualifications of the other members of the ticket, and with this meeting\r\nthe Progressive campaign of 1912 closed with a blaze of unforgettable\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\nOn election day I received the following letter from Roosevelt:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                        YSTER BAY\r\n                                                   _November 5, 1912_\r\n\r\n     DEAR OSCAR:\r\n\r\n     I count myself fortunate in having run upon the same ticket with\r\n     you and in having had the privilege of supporting you. You are the\r\n     kind of American who makes one proud of being an American; and I\r\n     wish also to say that I feel just the same way about all your\r\n     family, your dear wife, your two daughters and son. It is just such\r\n     a family, and just such a family life, as I like to think of as\r\n     typical of our citizenship at its best.\r\n\r\n         With affectionate regard and esteem\r\n                                       Faithfully yours\r\n                                              THEODORE ROOSEVELT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Progressives, as might have been expected, had been poorly\r\norganized. The time had been too short for intensive development of our\r\nforces. We had no machine, and in a number of the counties there was\r\nscarcely a skeleton of an organization. It was, in fact, not a party in\r\nthe ordinary sense of the word at all, but rather a crusade, and what we\r\nlacked in organization we made up by an abundance of spontaneous ardor.\r\nWe did not really expect victory, although Roosevelt several times said\r\nthat while he knew he would be defeated, he thought I would be elected.\r\nAs a matter of fact, I believe I was the only candidate of the\r\nProgressive cause for Governor in any State who ran ahead of Roosevelt.\r\nIn New York State he got 389,000 votes, in round numbers, while I had\r\n393,000.\r\n\r\nI knew from observations during my campaign from one end of the State to\r\nthe other, how poorly, from a political standpoint, the Progressives\r\nwere organized, and I confess I did not see the slightest chance of\r\nbeing elected. I was not disappointed, and I think that the men\r\ngenerally who ran for offices on the Progressive ticket were not\r\ndisappointed. They realized that their contest was waged for a cause\r\nand not for office, and from an educational point of view the campaign\r\nwas eminently successful.\r\n\r\nConsidering the vastness of the undertaking and the shortness of the\r\ntime, we did as well as any of us could have anticipated, if not better.\r\nWe were confident that the cause would triumph, in a degree at least, no\r\nmatter what party was in power, and I think the facts amply justify our\r\nbelief that the Progressive ideals made a definite impression upon the\r\ncountry, and have given strength, if not dominant influence, to\r\nProgressive principles in both of the old parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHREATENING CLOUDS OF WAR\r\n\r\n     Sinister tension in the international air--The Hague\r\n     Treaties--Germany's opposition to satisfactory understandings--New\r\n     spirit of international good-will gains popular momentum--A\r\n     conference with Secretary Hay--The Senate jealous of its authority;\r\n     the treaties are not submitted--My address before the New York\r\n     Peace Society--Other addresses on world peace--Carnegie's notable\r\n     efforts--My lectures at the United States Naval War College at\r\n     Newport--Conflicts of sovereignty respecting naturalized\r\n     citizens--The Lake Mohonk Conferences--The American Society of\r\n     International Law is founded--Distinguished speakers at first\r\n     annual meeting--The Society's growth and permanence--Roosevelt\r\n     astounds the world by sending the fleet around the world--The\r\n     homecoming of the fleet--Opposition to free tolls for American\r\n     ships in coastwise trade--The Mexican problem and my suggestions to\r\n     the President as to how to meet it--Italy makes war on Turkey for\r\n     Tripoli--Other Powers fail to grasp their opportunity to effect\r\n     peaceful adjustment--My protests and warnings are published by \"The\r\n     Outlook\"--The outburst of wars in the Balkans--Germany's ruthless\r\n     aggressive policy is disclosed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ominous clouds, visible from time to time on the diplomatic horizon\r\nduring my last mission to Turkey, had latterly expanded from only local\r\nsignificance into implications of greater and more sinister magnitude.\r\nIt had accordingly grown more and more apparent to me that the tinder\r\nbox of Europe, the Eastern Question, was likely to burst into flames at\r\nalmost any moment; and, in common with other close observers, I was not\r\nunaware of an inscrutable and widespread tension in the international\r\nair.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to many of us that America, which had so long remained wrapped\r\nrather complacently in its cloak of isolation, might have a stern duty\r\nto perform, not only to itself, but to the rest of the world. That duty\r\nseemed to us to involve the immediate need of a more vigorous promotion\r\nof world peace and of the specific and definite designing and\r\nconstructing of a proper machinery of enforcement.\r\n\r\nIn 1899, and again in 1907, to be sure, we had taken a leading part in\r\nthe two Hague Peace Conferences, at the first of which twenty-six, and\r\nin the second of which forty-four, nations participated. These nations\r\nhad signed and ratified the various treaties formulated by the two\r\nconferences. The first conference was called by the Emperor of Russia.\r\nIts main purpose, as stated in the Russian note proposing the\r\nconference, was by means of international discussion and agreement to\r\nprovide the most effective means for ensuring to all peoples the\r\nbenefits of a real and lasting peace, and, above all, to limit the\r\nprogressive development of armaments.\r\n\r\nSoon after the conference assembled, it was found that no agreement\r\ncould be reached respecting the limitation of armaments, whereupon the\r\nattention of the delegates was chiefly directed to formulating plans for\r\nthe peaceful settlement of international disputes. This resulted in the\r\nadoption of a treaty of arbitration entitled: \"Convention for the\r\nPacific Settlement of International Disputes.\" The American, the\r\nBritish, and the delegates of several other leading Powers favored an\r\nagreement for compulsory arbitration of all matters of a juridical\r\nnature; but this was opposed at the first conference by Germany,[2] and\r\nagain at the second conference. The treaty, however, in a modified and\r\npurely optional form, was adopted, though it fell short, by reason of\r\nGermany's opposition, of much that it was hoped to attain; yet it was a\r\ndistinct gain in providing definite machinery for the maintenance of\r\npeace and the adjustment of international differences by peaceful means.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 2: Andrew D. White, chairman of the American delegation,\r\n  states in his diary: \"It now appears (June 9, 1899) that the German\r\n  Emperor is determined to oppose the whole scheme of arbitration, and\r\n  will have nothing to do with any plan for a regular tribunal whether as\r\n  given in the British or the American scheme. This news comes from\r\n  various sources and is confirmed by the fact that in the sub-committee\r\n  one of the German delegates, Professor Zorn of Koenigsberg, who had\r\n  become very earnest in behalf of arbitration, now says that he may not\r\n  be able to vote for it. There are also signs that the German Emperor is\r\n  influencing the minds of his allies, the sovereigns of Austria, Italy,\r\n  Turkey, and Roumania, leading them to oppose it.\" (_Autobiography of\r\n  Andrew Dickson White_, vol. II, pp. 293-94.)]\r\n\r\nIn the development of international relations, in case of the threat of\r\nwar or of actual war, it was regarded as an unfriendly act for outside\r\nPowers to tender good offices or to mediate in the cause of peace. This\r\nunfortunate and unrighteous condition was radically changed and indeed\r\nreversed by the treaty; the signatories agreed not only to have recourse\r\nto the good offices or mediation of friendly Powers, but agreed also\r\nthat such Powers should on their own initiative tender such good offices\r\nto the States at variance, and that such overtures should never be\r\nregarded as an unfriendly act by either of the parties in dispute.\r\nEspecially in our country and in Great Britain, these treaties awakened\r\nanew the spirit of international justice and good-will, and there ensued\r\nmany meetings designed to inform and stimulate popular interest in the\r\ncause of world peace.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJohn W. Foster, former Secretary of State, who had been in New York a\r\nshort time before as a member of a committee to provide for a public\r\nmeeting urging the ratification of the arbitration treaties, had made an\r\nappointment for me to meet Secretary Hay for a conference regarding\r\nthem. I met Mr. Foster at the Cosmos Club and went with him to meet Mr.\r\nHay at the latter's residence. Hay, as usual, met us in his gracious way\r\nand we discussed the subject from all sides. My main concern was that\r\nthese little arbitration treaties, which excepted questions of \"vital\r\ninterest and national honor,\" should not have the effect of abridging\r\nthe broader provisions of the Hague Treaty. I had brought with me a\r\ndraft of a treaty which guarded against such contingencies, with which\r\nMr. Foster seemed to be in agreement.\r\n\r\nHay said he fully caught my idea, but that it had been desired to make\r\nall of these treaties alike and to conform with the one between France\r\nand Great Britain. He said it would be difficult enough, as it was, to\r\nget these treaties through the Senate, as there was considerable\r\nopposition, and therefore it was advisable to have these treaties with\r\nthe several Powers identical; otherwise separate arguments would be made\r\nagainst each of the treaties. The Secretary asked me, however, to leave\r\nwith him the draft I had prepared, saying that it might prove very\r\nuseful to him.\r\n\r\nThe final upshot was that these treaties, to which Hay had devoted so\r\nmuch care and thought during his last months in Washington, and by which\r\nhe hoped to lessen the likelihood of war throughout the world, were\r\nviolently opposed in the Senate on the ground that they deprived it of\r\nits constitutional rights. Senators Knox and Spooner and their followers\r\ntook the view that every separate agreement to arbitrate under these\r\ntreaties must be submitted to the Senate. An amendment to this effect\r\nemasculated the main purposes of the treaty and left the subject of\r\narbitration substantially as it would be without any treaties. As Hay\r\nstated, Roosevelt saw the situation plainly enough and decided not to\r\nsubmit the treaties for ratification by the other Powers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn my return home from Turkey, the New York Peace Society, of which I\r\nhad been the president until I entered the Cabinet in 1906, and whose\r\nmembership and activities had been very much enlarged under my\r\nsuccessor, Andrew Carnegie, gave me a reception on January 7, 1910, at\r\nthe Hotel Plaza, in New York. Mr. Carnegie, who was earnestly and\r\nintensely devoted to the cause of international peace, and who had\r\ndonated the necessary money for the construction of the Peace Palace at\r\nThe Hague, presided at this reception, and made one of his\r\ncharacteristic addresses. The subject of my talk was \"The Threatening\r\nClouds of War,\" as they appeared to me to be gathering in the Near East\r\nand in the Balkans.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me that the most timely public service I could possibly\r\nrender during this period was to help arouse public opinion to a sense\r\nof the imperative need of a newer view of world relations, and a genuine\r\npublic demand for an international understanding and machinery with\r\nwhich peace might be maintained.\r\n\r\n\"World Peace\" was therefore my subject when, on April 13th of the same\r\nyear, the Authors' Club tendered me a dinner \"in recognition of my\r\npublic services at home and abroad.\" It was presided over by the veteran\r\nauthor and publisher, Henry Holt, who nominated Mr. Carnegie as\r\ntoastmaster. Speeches were made by our ambassador to Berlin, David Jayne\r\nHill, by Rev. Dr. Thomas R. Slicer, Edward M. Shepard, Professor William\r\nP. Trent, of Columbia University, and several others.\r\n\r\nThough the Authors' Club has a comparatively small membership, limited\r\nto members of the craft, yet there have sprung from its ranks a number\r\nof our most eminent diplomatists, such as John Hay, Andrew D. White,\r\nGeneral Horace Porter, David Jayne Hill, Dr. Henry van Dyke, Seth Low,\r\nand Frederick W. Holls. The last two were delegates to the First Hague\r\nPeace Conference.\r\n\r\nDetermined to make the most of the growing popular agitation for the\r\npromotion of international arbitration and peace, Mr. Carnegie soon\r\nafterwards organized a great peace meeting which was held in Carnegie\r\nHall, New York City. The big hall was packed from pit to dome, and\r\nthousands were unable to gain admission. The meeting was opened by Mr.\r\nCarnegie, as presiding officer, and he was followed by Baron\r\nd'Estournelles de Constant. In my address I specially emphasized neutral\r\nduties in time of war and the inhibition upon neutrals to lend money to\r\nbelligerents pending war as being quite as much an unneutral act as the\r\nselling of ships of war and armaments, as had been usually the case in\r\nthe past when money thus borrowed was used for that very purpose.\r\n\r\nDuring the years 1903, 1904, and 1905, I devoted much attention to\r\nquestions affecting international relations. I was invited by Admiral\r\nChadwick, president of the United States Naval War College at Newport,\r\nto deliver several lectures during the summer of 1903, and took for my\r\nsubject the protection of our citizens abroad, and surveyed the entire\r\nsubject of citizenship, native-born and naturalized. I pointed out that\r\nby the law of July 27, 1868, it was specifically provided that\r\nnaturalized citizens while in foreign states shall receive from our\r\nGovernment the same protection as to their persons and property that is\r\naccorded to native-born citizens in like circumstances. All the European\r\ncountries denied the right of expatriation, while America from the\r\nbeginning had insisted upon that right as one of its basic elements of\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nIn several notable instances, our Navy had taken prompt action to uphold\r\nAmerican rights. One such case was that of Martin Coszta, a Hungarian\r\ninsurgent in the revolution of 1848-49, who escaped to Turkey and from\r\nthere came to the United States and made the usual declaration\r\npreparatory to being naturalized under our laws. He returned to Turkey\r\nin 1854, and at Smyrna he was seized while on shore and taken up by the\r\ncrew of an Austrian frigate and put in irons. Before the boat got under\r\nway, an American frigate arrived and threatened to sink the Austrian\r\nvessel unless Coszta was released. This led to an agreement under which\r\nhe was put in the custody of the French consul-general.\r\n\r\nIt is of the highest importance that the men of our Navy, especially\r\nthose in command of ships, should be conversant with the principles of\r\ninternational law, as they are frequently called upon to act promptly.\r\nThis conflict of sovereignty respecting naturalized citizens caused the\r\nwar between us and Great Britain in 1812. Beginning with 1868, we\r\nconcluded treaties of naturalization with the German States and\r\nAustria-Hungary, and subsequently with most of the other States.\r\n\r\nMy address was subsequently published in the quarterly proceedings of\r\nthe College of March, 1904. The following year I delivered another\r\naddress before the College on international relations specifically with\r\nreference to Russia and the United States. This address was likewise\r\npublished in the proceedings of the Naval War College, and with some\r\nmodifications appeared in the \"North American Review\" of August, 1905.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor a number of years many of the leading men of the country who were\r\ninterested in international relations were annually, at the beginning of\r\nthe summer, the guests of Messrs. Smiley at their noted hotel at Lake\r\nMohonk. These gatherings were known as the Lake Mohonk Conferences on\r\nInternational Arbitration, lasted several days, and addresses were made\r\nupon various international subjects.\r\n\r\nAt the conference of 1905, it occurred to some of the members who were\r\nin attendance, who had long entertained the idea that an American\r\nsociety devoted exclusively to the interests of international law should\r\nbe formed, that, in view of the large attendance that year of many\r\nprominent men interested in the subject, it would be a propitious time\r\nto organize. James Brown Scott, Professor of International Law at\r\nColumbia University, and Professor George W. Kirchwey, Dean of the Law\r\nSchool of the University, were most active in promoting the idea. A\r\npreliminary meeting was called, and about fifty of the gentlemen in\r\nattendance at the conference took part. They elected me as chairman,\r\nProfessor James Brown Scott as secretary, and appointed a committee of\r\ntwenty-one to effect a permanent organization. The committee so\r\nappointed consisted of the following: Chandler P. Anderson, James B.\r\nAngell, Professor Joseph H. Beale, Jr., David J. Brewer, Charles Henry\r\nButler, J. M. Dickinson, John W. Foster, George Gray, Professor Charles\r\nNoble Gregory, John W. Griggs, Professor George W. Kirchwey, Robert\r\nLansing, Professor John Bassett Moore, W. W. Morrow, Professor Leo S.\r\nRowe, Professor James B. Scott, Oscar S. Straus, Everett P. Wheeler,\r\nAndrew D. White, Professor George G. Wilson, and Theodore S. Woolsey.\r\n\r\nThe American Society of International Law was formally organized on\r\nJanuary 12, 1906. Back of its founding was the firm belief that the\r\ninfluence of an association of publicists and others, organized along\r\nthe lines indicated, would count for much in the formation of a sound\r\nand rational body of doctrine concerning the true principles of\r\ninternational relations.\r\n\r\nThe following editorial comment regarding this organization is quoted\r\nfrom the January, 1907, issue of \"The American Journal of International\r\nLaw\":\r\n\r\n     While the necessity of such a society was felt by many, no serious\r\n     steps were taken until the summer of 1905. It occurred to some of\r\n     the members of the Mohonk Lake conference on international\r\n     arbitration, that a society devoted exclusively to the interests of\r\n     international law as distinct from international arbitration might\r\n     be formed and that the members of the Mohonk Conference would\r\n     supply a nucleus membership. Accordingly a call was issued to the\r\n     members present at the conference, and as the result of the call\r\n     and meeting of those interested a committee was appointed with\r\n     Oscar S. Straus as chairman and James B. Scott as secretary, to\r\n     consider plans for a definite organization and for the publication\r\n     of a journal exclusively devoted to international law as the organ\r\n     of the Society. On December 9th, 1905, a meeting of the committee\r\n     was held at the residence of Oscar S. Straus in New York City, and\r\n     as the result of favorable reports of the members present it\r\n     appeared feasible to proceed immediately to the definitive\r\n     organization of the Society. Accordingly a call was issued by the\r\n     chairman for a meeting of those interested in international law and\r\n     its popularization, to be held at the New York Bar Association, on\r\n     Friday, January 12th, 1906.\r\n\r\n     At this meeting it was decided to organize upon a permanent basis a\r\n     society of those interested in the spread of international law with\r\n     its ideals of justice and therefore of peace; a constitution was\r\n     adopted; officers were elected and the Society took its place, it\r\n     is hoped, permanently among the learned and influential societies\r\n     of the world.\r\n\r\nOn April 19 and 20, 1907, was held the first annual meeting of the\r\nAmerican Society of International Law, at Washington, which was attended\r\nby an unexpectedly large number of members. The society had grown, in\r\nthe short time since its organization, to a membership of over five\r\nhundred. The various sessions were devoted to discussions of\r\ninternational topics, and closed with a banquet presided over by\r\nSecretary Root, and addresses were made by several speakers, including\r\ntwo former Secretaries of State, namely, Richard Olney and John W.\r\nFoster, as well as by James Bryce, General Horace Porter, and the\r\nwriter.\r\n\r\nTo-day the society has more than twelve hundred members, and since 1907\r\nit has regularly held annual meetings and issued its quarterly\r\npublication, \"The American Journal of International Law.\" Since the\r\nbeginning, Elihu Root has been the president, with whom are associated\r\nas vice-presidents and members of the executive council more than forty\r\nof the leading writers and authorities, Senators and judges, including\r\nthe Chief Justice of the United States. I still am the chairman of the\r\nexecutive committee, of which Professor Scott has from the beginning\r\nbeen the recording secretary, as well as the editor-in-chief of the\r\n\"Journal.\" An analytical index of the fourteen volumes of the \"Journal\"\r\n(1907-20) has recently been prepared by George A. Finch, secretary of\r\nthe board of editors.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile these various groups were pressing forward on their respective\r\navenues of approach to a better understanding between nations, President\r\nRoosevelt was applying his energies to the problem in his own way. His\r\nmethod was in this instance characterized by a strikingly objective and\r\ndramatic treatment. He firmly believed that the greater power a peaceful\r\nnation has to make war in a world threatened by war, the greater becomes\r\nits power to command peace. The peace societies will not endorse this\r\ncontention; but the history of international relations gives force to\r\nthat proposition. Such are international amenities, paradoxical as it\r\nmay appear.\r\n\r\nRoosevelt's terse message to a world threatened by war was to send a\r\ngreat fleet of battleships on a voyage round the world.\r\n\r\nThe fleet was scheduled to return to Hampton Roads on Washington's\r\nbirthday, February 22, 1908. It was to be reviewed on its arrival by the\r\nPresident. Admiral Adolph Marix, the chairman of the Lighthouse Board in\r\nmy Department, in the tender Maple took my wife and me, Mr. and Mrs.\r\nLeonard Hockstader, my son-in-law and daughter, and several officials of\r\nthe Department to Hampton Roads, and we steamed out to the tail of the\r\nHorse Shoe some ten miles from Old Point Comfort. At the appointed time,\r\neleven o'clock that day, Admiral Sperry in his flagship Connecticut\r\npassed in review before the President, and following him came the\r\ntwenty-four battleships consisting of the sixteen ships that went around\r\nthe Horn, and eight additional ones, most of which had been completed\r\nsince the squadron had left the Atlantic on this voyage sixteen months\r\nbefore. These ships had steamed 42,000 miles without any hitch or any\r\ncasualty, or any untoward circumstance.\r\n\r\nWhen the President first decided that this trip should be made, all\r\nkinds of hostile criticism bristled in the press of the country. But the\r\nPresident, with his usual alertness, had several far-sighted purposes in\r\nview. He says in his \"Autobiography\": \"At that time, as I happened to\r\nknow neither the English nor the German authorities believed it possible\r\nto take a fleet of great battleships around the world, I made up my mind\r\nthat it was time to have a show-down in the matter; because if it was\r\nreally true that our fleet could not get from the Atlantic to the\r\nPacific, it was much better to know it and be able to shape our policy\r\nin view of the knowledge.\"\r\n\r\nThe great show of naval strength on the part of the United States that\r\nthis voyage illustrated naturally had its effect throughout the world. A\r\nstrength that is not menacing tends to allay menace. And in this\r\ninstance the visit of the fleet to Japan was promptly interpreted by\r\nthe Japanese as one of courtesy and good-will. The President, again and\r\nagain in his public utterances, as well as in his private statements at\r\nCabinet meetings, had emphasized his view that a strong navy makes for\r\npeace. And toasting the admirals and captains in the cabin of the\r\nMayflower, he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it magnificent? Nobody after this will forget that the American\r\ncoast is on the Pacific as well as on the Atlantic!\"\r\n\r\nThe home-coming of the fleet was a most imposing sight. The weather was\r\nbeautiful, and altogether the function appeared as calm and peaceful as\r\nif it had been a magnificent pleasure excursion, which indeed it had\r\nproved to be.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn my return to America in the fall of 1913, there were two notable\r\nquestions that occupied the attention of President Wilson and Congress,\r\nin which as a private citizen I had taken some part. I was soon invited\r\nby the National Republican Club to take part in a luncheon discussion of\r\n\"Present World Problems,\" and this enabled me to discuss a subject that\r\nhad resulted in a plank in the National Platform of the Progressive\r\nParty, \"that American ships engaged in coastwise trade shall pay no\r\ntolls.\" As this question did not arise in the New York State campaign, I\r\nhad had no occasion to discuss it except on one occasion when I was\r\nasked what my stand was upon that subject, and I plainly stated that I\r\ndid not favor the remission of tolls, as it conflicted with the spirit,\r\nif not with the express wording, of the Hay-Pauncefote Treaty, and that\r\nI would only favor it in the event the question were left to arbitration\r\nand decided in our favor. In this discussion I went somewhat fully into\r\nthe subject, making it clear why I was not in favor of free tolls, and\r\nwhy I supported the President in the stand that he had taken for repeal\r\nof the act that freed our coastwise ships from such tolls.\r\n\r\nOthers who spoke at this luncheon on various phases of the general\r\nproblem were William L. Mackenzie King, at this writing the Premier of\r\nCanada, and Miss Mabel T. Boardman, representing the American Red Cross.\r\n\r\nIn April the Senate Committee on Interoceanic Canals held hearings upon\r\nan act to amend the Panama Canal Act repealing the provision providing\r\nfor freeing coastwise American ships from tolls. Upon invitation I\r\nappeared before this committee and supported the position that the\r\nPresident had taken, in opposition to the provisions of the platform of\r\nhis party, for the repeal of the free tolls clause. Upon the urgent\r\nrequest of the President, the repealing act was passed. Some of our\r\nablest Senators, regardless of party, took opposing sides upon this\r\nquestion. Elihu Root, who was then Senator, presented, in my judgment,\r\nthe most convincing argument and the ablest speech of his distinguished\r\ncareer in the Senate, advocating the repeal of the free tolls clause.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother international subject which I was carefully studying at this\r\ntime was our relations with Mexico. I felt then, as I do now, that our\r\nGovernment has often been badly served and wrongly advised in regard to\r\naffairs in Mexico. I suggested to the President that he should send to\r\nMexico a commission of experienced men who could in a comparatively\r\nshort time lay before him the true conditions as a guide for our\r\ngovernmental action. I pointed out that under circumstances different,\r\nbut no less perplexing, this plan had been adopted by Cleveland during\r\nthe Venezuela trouble, and that the appointment of that commission, of\r\nwhich Justice Brewer of the Supreme Court was chairman, had hastened\r\nthe solution. When the idea of the United States sending a commission\r\nsuch as I recommended became publicly known, it was favorably received\r\nby General Huerta, the then President of Mexico, as well as by Carranza.\r\nThe appointment of such a commission would have had the additional\r\neffect of offsetting the pressure in Congress for intervention, and\r\nseveral of the leading Senators expressed themselves as favoring it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen storm clouds are rushing across the sky, it is very difficult to\r\nforetell where the lightning will strike. It is needless here to discuss\r\nthe professed but spurious reasons why Italy declared war upon Turkey in\r\n1911. It was evident that no _casus belli_ existed in any international\r\nsense. The naked fact was that Italy determined to have a slice of\r\nnorthern Africa, and was favored in that craving by several of the Great\r\nPowers, chiefly to prevent Germany from getting a foothold on the\r\nMediterranean. I knew from my observations in Turkey that this\r\naggressive action on the part of Italy would far transcend the interest\r\nof either Italy or Turkey, and would inevitably arouse the restless\r\nBalkan Powers to action.\r\n\r\nIn a communication that I sent to Secretary of State Knox on September\r\n29, 1911, attention was directed to what would probably be the outcome\r\nof this action on the part of Italy; also that the Hague Treaty not only\r\nsanctioned, but made it morally incumbent upon Powers that were\r\nstrangers to the dispute, to tender their good offices for the purpose\r\nof a peaceful adjustment. Just because the United States could not be\r\naccused of having any direct interest, such an offer could have been\r\nmade with best grace by our country. If ever there had been a war of\r\nconquest, that was one. One of the London papers had frankly criticized\r\nItaly's precipitous act as that of \"pirate, brigand, and buccaneer.\"\r\n\r\nIn an article written for \"The Outlook\" following a number of public\r\naddresses upon the same subject, I pointed out that Turkey, both\r\nimmediately before and since hostilities began, had appealed to the\r\nChristian nations of the world, who were co-signatories with her of the\r\nHague Treaty, to use their good offices for peace, but the Christian\r\nnations had declined to act. In this article I stated:\r\n\r\n     So far as it opens an era possibly of the gravest menace to Europe,\r\n     it is primarily of European concern; but in so far as the\r\n     provisions of the Peace Treaty are disregarded by neutral Powers,\r\n     this is a grave moral loss no less for us than for all nations, the\r\n     magnitude of which is not lessened, but increased by the fact that\r\n     Christian Italy is making an unprovoked war upon a Mohammedan\r\n     Power. The efforts to bring about a peaceful adjustment under the\r\n     circumstances is not only a moral right, but a right under the\r\n     Convention in which Turkey, Italy, and the United States are\r\n     equally signatories with the other forty-one nations.\r\n\r\n     The international moral damage this war entails is the concern of\r\n     all nations. The manner in which it was precipitated without first\r\n     having recourse to the enlightened methods of peaceful adjustment,\r\n     combined with the concerted refusal of European Powers to attempt\r\n     mediation, will make peace treaties waste paper, and peace\r\n     professions of civilized nations sham and hypocrisy.\r\n\r\nIn quick succession this war was followed in 1912 by the first Balkan\r\nwar against Turkey, and then in 1913 by the second Balkan war, between\r\nthe Balkan nations themselves to divide the spoils. For thirty years the\r\nTreaty of Berlin (1878) had served to maintain European peace. The first\r\nbreach was the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina by Austria. The\r\nsecond was the Italian-Turkish war, followed by the Balkan wars. The\r\ntoll of these latter wars entailed a sacrifice of 300,000 dead or\r\npermanently disabled on the field of battle; and the immediate\r\nconsequence was to upset \"the balance of power\" so that the Great Powers\r\nat once heavily extended their armies and navies, and their budgets ran\r\nwild.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nProbably the most illuminating document concerning the conditions that\r\nled up to the World War is the Lichnowsky Memorandum which is entitled:\r\n\"My London Mission, 1912-1914.\" I had known Prince Lichnowsky when he\r\nwas one of the secretaries of the German Embassy during my first mission\r\nto Turkey. He was appointed ambassador to England after the death of\r\nBaron Marschall in September, 1912. This memorandum was prepared as a\r\npersonal record during the second year of the war, and, after being\r\nprivately circulated, was, by design or otherwise, published. It is the\r\nmost convincing indictment of Germany's ruthless aggressive policy, and\r\nit naturally brought down upon its author the severest condemnation of\r\nthe Emperor and the militarists. Germany's reiterated claim that Great\r\nBritain, having designed Germany's destruction, sought to justify the\r\nlarge increase of her navy, was disproved by her own ambassador.\r\n\r\nThe events that resolved themselves into the World War, as well as the\r\nWorld War itself, are most convincing proofs that the preservation of\r\npeace is a matter of common interest to the entire family of nations,\r\nand that it must not be left to a single member of this group to disturb\r\nthe world's peace at will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nPERSONAL VIGNETTES\r\n\r\n     We motor through northern Africa--The King of Italy discusses world\r\n     politics--Exploring historical ruins with the Mayor of Rome and\r\n     Georg Brandes--Two Cardinals--David Lubin, international genius--In\r\n     London--William Watson, the British poet, considers residing in\r\n     America and asks about cost of living--Lloyd George curious about\r\n     Progressives--He guarantees a one-pound note--John Burns discourses\r\n     on British history--The notable housing experiment at Hampstead\r\n     Garden Suburb--Earl and Lady Grey--At Skibo Castle with Andrew\r\n     Carnegie--Indifferent golf, but fine trout fishing--At The Hague\r\n     Peace Palace--Some eminent Hollanders--Turning the laugh on the\r\n     cartoonists--Rudyard Kipling on having a daughter in society--An\r\n     evening with Israel Zangwill--Henri Bergson in an argument with\r\n     Roosevelt, with Rodin, the sculptor, a bored listener--To Spain to\r\n     attend Kermit Roosevelt's wedding--Spanish politics--A protege of\r\n     Bismarck--Recollections of Disraeli--Evidence of Spanish and Jewish\r\n     origin of Christopher Columbus.\r\n\r\n\r\nMotoring leisurely through Algiers and Tunis with Mrs. Straus, I was now\r\nenjoying a delightful holiday, free from cares and responsibility. The\r\ndrowsy tropical air invited complete relaxation, and the lazy African\r\ndays ushered us into a world unbelievably remote from that of American\r\npolitics. Graceful, luminous Algiers, with its brilliant European\r\nhotels, charming cafes, veiled women, and swarthy men, etched lasting\r\nimpressions upon our minds. My defeat in the tense Progressive contest\r\nfor the governorship of New York had afforded me this opportunity for\r\nanother taste of freedom. It was in the spring of the year 1913, and the\r\nmountains through which we toured were full of unexpected and beguiling\r\nscenes. This region is not only rich in historic associations, but the\r\nengineering skill of the French has in turn modernized it with excellent\r\nmotor roads. From Tunis we crossed to Sicily, where we visited the\r\nCarthaginian, Greek, and Roman remains of columns and temples that still\r\nbear tragic witness to the conflict between the armies of Hannibal and\r\nScipio, and between the transplanted Asiatic and European civilizations.\r\n\r\nWe made our way to Rome, where Ambassador Thomas J. O'Brien showed us\r\nmany attentions, and arranged for an audience on April 28th with Victor\r\nEmmanuel III. The King was most affable and agreeable, and spoke perfect\r\nEnglish. He referred to my several missions to Turkey, and said he, too,\r\nwas there frequently when he was in the navy. He spoke with an intimate\r\nknowledge of the men and affairs in the Near East that surprised me. We\r\ndiscussed Arabia and the unrest there due to the incompetency of the\r\nSultan's Government, and soon the conversation turned to the Balkan\r\nsituation. I said I feared that as soon as the treaty then being\r\nnegotiated, which was to end the first Balkan War against Turkey, was\r\nsigned, a fresh war would break out among the five Balkan Powers. That\r\nwould not surprise him, he said, but considered that it might be best to\r\nlet them fight it out. I answered that the trouble with that course was\r\nthat the fight would involve the Great Powers, as the several Balkan\r\nStates were attached to strings that led directly into the chancelleries\r\nof the Great Powers--with which the King did not disagree.\r\n\r\nWe talked of the Jews, and he said in Italy they were not made a\r\nseparate element in the population. \"We neither know nor care whether a\r\nman is a Jew or not,\" he remarked, adding that the only persons who took\r\nspecial notice of the subject at all were occasional clericals.\r\nPersonally he was very fond of the Jews; nearly every ministry had\r\ncontained one or more; and General Ottolenghi, a Jew who had been\r\nMinister of War a few years before, had been one of his most favored\r\ninstructors. Altogether we had a fine talk of over an hour. The King's\r\nquick and vigorous mind, his clearness of vision and breadth of\r\nintellectual grasp I found very refreshing. Unlike some of the monarchs,\r\nhe did not seem detached and weighted down by a sense of his own\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nFrom my friend Isaac N. Seligman, since deceased, of New York, I had\r\nreceived a letter of introduction to Ernesto Nathan, Mayor of Rome, of\r\nwhom I had heard much and whom I was therefore anxious to meet. I sent\r\nMr. Seligman's letter, together with my card, to the Mayor. The next\r\nmorning, when Mrs. Straus and I were leaving our hotel for a motor ride,\r\na tall, prepossessing gentleman, who impressed me somewhat as a typical\r\nEnglishman, came toward me with a look of recognition which I\r\ninstinctively answered.\r\n\r\n\"Is this Mr. Straus? I am Mr. Nathan,\" he said, in perfect English.\r\n\r\nHis brother was with him, and we were glad to return to the hotel with\r\nthem for a chat. We arranged for a little excursion the next day to the\r\nancient Roman commercial city of Ostia, whose ruins were being\r\nexcavated. In the midst of these plans the Mayor remarked that a friend\r\nof his, Georg Brandes, the Danish savant and critic, was in Rome, and if\r\nagreeable to us he would like to have him join us. Of course it was\r\nagreeable, and in our little party next day were Mayor Nathan, his\r\nbrother, his daughter, Georg Brandes, a Signor Cena, editor of a leading\r\nItalian review, and ourselves. The Mayor acted as guide and showed an\r\nastonishing familiarity with things archaeological in a most delightful\r\nway; even the occasional spells of rain in no way dampened our enjoyment\r\nof the trip. Upon our return, the Mayor took us to lunch in a typical\r\nItalian restaurant, where we spent two hours at a sociable repast.\r\n\r\nMy introduction to Mayor Ernesto Nathan led to a friendship which I\r\nprized highly and enjoyed until his death in April, 1921. He was born in\r\nEngland of Jewish parents. His father was a banker and a descendant of\r\nthe Frankfort family of Nathans, a collateral branch of the Mayer family\r\nfrom whom is descended the great banking family of Rothschild. After his\r\nfather died, his mother took the family to Pisa to live. Here their home\r\nbecame a refuge for Italian patriots, as it had been in London. At\r\ntwenty-five Signor Nathan became business manager of \"La Roma del\r\nPopolo,\" a paper started by Giuseppe Mazzini, a friend of the family,\r\nwhose works he later edited. Nathan remained an editor and publisher\r\nuntil he entered politics. He became Mayor of Rome in 1907, elected by\r\nthe anti-clerical party, and during the six years he remained Mayor he\r\ndid much to modernize Rome, especially in the improvement of its\r\nstreet-car service and its sanitation, so that the city's death-rate\r\nbecame one of the lowest in Europe. He was highly esteemed, and even the\r\nclericals respected his uprightness and efficiency.\r\n\r\nBrandes, when I met him, was nearly seventy years old, but\r\nintellectually vigorous and brilliant, although cynical, even if at\r\ntimes humorously and delightfully so.\r\n\r\nThrough David Lubin, American delegate to the International Institute of\r\nAgriculture, whom I had known for many years, we met Professor Luigi\r\nLuzzatti, Professor of International Law at the University of Rome, a\r\nleading member of the Italian Chamber, and a convincing orator and\r\npublicist. He was then in his seventies, a large, statesmanlike figure\r\nof distinguished appearance. We spent a pleasant hour in his apartment\r\non the Via Veneto opposite our hotel. He said he was gratified to find\r\nmy views, as expressed in my \"Roger Williams\" and in my chapter on the\r\ndevelopment of religious liberty in my \"American Spirit,\" so much in\r\naccord with his own. He told me about his brochure, \"Liberta di\r\nConsciensa e di Sciensa,\" which had been translated into German under\r\nthe title \"Freiheit des Gewissens und Wissens.\" In it he makes\r\nconsiderable reference to Roger Williams, and pays me the compliment of\r\nsaying that he derived the inspiration for his book from mine. He also\r\nquotes extensively from Roosevelt's letter on religious liberty, which I\r\nhave embodied in Chapter X of this volume.\r\n\r\nI called on Professor Luzzatti a number of times thereafter, which in\r\nhis charming way he had begged me to do because he was confined to the\r\nhouse with a cold and therefore could not call on me. In one of his\r\nnotes he wrote that we were friends because our ideas and ideals were\r\nthe same, and he wanted to be sure to see me again before I left Rome.\r\nHe confirmed what the King had told me, that there was no anti-Semitic\r\nspirit in Italy. He said he was a Jew, but was not brought up\r\nreligiously as such, although he was known to be ready on all necessary\r\noccasions to stand up for his people.\r\n\r\nProfessor Luzzatti was largely responsible for improving Italy's\r\nfinancial system, and in the establishment of the Banca Popolari, or\r\nPeople's Banks. He was also influential in the negotiation of Italy's\r\ncommercial treaties.\r\n\r\nThrough the offices of P. R. Mackenzie, who for a number of years had\r\nbeen Rome correspondent of the \"New York Sun,\" I met Cardinals Rampolla\r\nand Falconio. We called first on the latter, who knew our country well.\r\nFor nine years he had been papal legate at Washington, during which time\r\nhe became a naturalized citizen. As we entered his reception room, I\r\nobserved two little American flags attached to an ornament on the\r\ncenter table. He informed, me as he greeted me that His Holiness was\r\nquite ill, otherwise he would have advised me to allow Cardinal Rampolla\r\nand himself to arrange for an audience.\r\n\r\nMr. Mackenzie informed the Cardinal that I had been a member of the\r\nRoosevelt Cabinet, which recalled Roosevelt's visit to Rome in 1910. Of\r\ncourse, I was anxious to learn how both these prelates regarded that\r\nincident. Cardinal Falconio said that the Holy Father had made no\r\nconditions as to the visit, but had merely expressed the hope that there\r\nmight be no repetition of the Fairbanks incident; the Holy Father knew\r\nhow broad-minded and well-disposed Roosevelt was toward all creeds and\r\nhad really wanted very much to meet him. The Cardinal said that of\r\ncourse Roosevelt could not be blamed; the matter should not have been\r\nhandled through the embassy. His remarks implied that the mismanagement\r\nhad been there.\r\n\r\nWe now went within the Vatican district, under the arch on the side, to\r\nthe palatial residence of Cardinal Rampolla. On entering, we were led to\r\nthe Cardinal's private room next to the formal reception chamber, where\r\nthe Cardinal greeted us warmly. He has great charm of manner and is most\r\ngracious; withal he impressed one as a keen, learned, and shrewd\r\nprelate. He was regarded as the ablest and most distinguished of the\r\ncardinals eligible to the Holy See, and it may be remembered that he was\r\nconsidered the logical successor of Leo XIII, and it was said he would\r\nprobably have been elected Pope but for the opposition of the Emperor of\r\nAustria.\r\n\r\nIn referring to the Roosevelt incident, he too held Roosevelt entirely\r\nblameless, and added that both he and Brother Falconio knew how kindly\r\nRoosevelt felt toward Catholics and the Holy See, and that there should\r\nhave been nothing official about that message; if he had been in Merry\r\nDel Val's place, the regrettable misunderstanding would not have\r\nhappened. Evidently he blamed the papal secretary.\r\n\r\nDavid Lubin gave a dinner at the Hotel de Russie to Mrs. Straus and me\r\non May 1st. Among the guests were Mayor Nathan and Marquis Sapelli,\r\npresident of the International Institute of Agriculture, and the\r\nMarchioness. Professor Luzzatti had accepted, but his cold still\r\nprevented his going out. Lubin was a rough diamond, so to speak: a man\r\nof vision, unlimited energy and enthusiasm. It was he who induced the\r\nItalian Government to recognize the International Institute of\r\nAgriculture, and he was regarded by that Government as its founder.\r\nIndeed, he was better understood in Rome than in Washington. He knew\r\nnothing and cared less about diplomatic amenities. When I was in the\r\nCabinet our ambassador at Rome had made an unfavorable report about him\r\nbecause of some supposed tactless move which was objected to by our\r\nambassador. This report displeased Secretary Root, and the result would\r\nhave been Lubin's recall as our delegate to the Institute, had I not\r\ninterceded for him with the President, explaining what manner of man\r\nLubin was, that he had no manners but genius, and that I felt sure the\r\nKing of Italy himself would intercede for him.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact about a year after that there was some question of\r\nappointing another person as American delegate, and the King did\r\nintercede for Lubin. For the help and encouragement that I gave this\r\nworthy man he was always thereafter most grateful to me. It was David\r\nLubin, too, who first aroused interest in America in the establishment\r\nof an agricultural credit system, as well as in the cooperative banks.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom Rome we went direct to London, where I shortly got in touch with\r\nWilliam Watson, the poet. I had met him the year before in the United\r\nStates. I was chairman of the executive committee of the Authors' Club\r\nat the time, and as such its president; the Club gave him a reception;\r\nalso he was at my house several times. It was said of him that he was\r\nbetter known than Robert Bridges and would have been selected as poet\r\nlaureate in preference to Bridges had he not written a poem called \"The\r\nWoman with the Serpent's Tongue,\" referring to Margot Asquith, wife of\r\nthe Premier, which spoiled his chances for official recognition. He\r\nappeared somewhat disappointed and to be considering permanent residence\r\nin America. He asked me about the cost of living in cities other than\r\nNew York, which he considered too extravagant.\r\n\r\nWatson gave me a luncheon at the British Empire Club, where I met a\r\nnumber of his friends--Sir Sidney Lee, editor of the \"Dictionary of\r\nNational Biography\"; Sir William Robertson Nicoll, editor of the\r\n\"Bookman\" and of the \"British Weekly\"; H. W. Massingham, editor of the\r\n\"Nation\"; and a few others. Watson told me that Sir Sidney Lee's\r\nbiography of Shakespeare was considered the best extant from an\r\nhistorical and critical point of view, and that his biography of King\r\nEdward had created a sensation in England, but that its aim was to\r\nportray the human side of King Edward. He told me also that Sir Sidney\r\nwas an Israelite. My own conversation with Sir Sidney was very general.\r\nHe is a mild man with a reserved manner.\r\n\r\nSir Charles and Lady Henry invited us to luncheon at their beautiful\r\ntown house in Carlton Gardens, to meet Lloyd George, who was then\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer. The other guests were: Sir Alexander Ure,\r\nsolicitor-general for Scotland; Dr. Thomas J. MacNamara, parliamentary\r\nsecretary to the Admiralty; Robert Donald, editor of the \"Daily\r\nChronicle,\" a leading labor daily.\r\n\r\nLloyd George explained the important Liberal measures to me,\r\nparticularly the National Insurance Act of 1911, amendments to which\r\nwere then being considered in the House. He declared that it was\r\nnecessary to curb or reform the House of Lords before social justice\r\nmeasures, such as this insurance act, legislation for old age pensions,\r\netc., could be put through. He asked about Roosevelt and the status of\r\nthe Progressive Party, and whether the newspapers were favorable to the\r\ncause; it seems that the newspapers did not give him adequate\r\ninformation regarding the Progressives. I had to tell him that many of\r\nour leading dailies were not with us. I explained to him that I thought\r\nthe Progressive movement could hardly be regarded as a party, but that I\r\nbelieved its influence in liberalizing both of the old parties would be\r\nconsiderable.\r\n\r\nWhen I was in London shortly after the outbreak of the World War, I\r\nremember a humorous incident at another meeting with Lloyd George, at a\r\nsmall dinner. For emergency use there had been issued one-pound treasury\r\nnotes that looked more like a \"shinplaster\" of our Civil War days than\r\nlike a dignified British pound. One of the guests brought in a number of\r\nthese, for which some of us exchanged gold. As I took one up I remarked\r\nabout the appearance of it and added that before I accepted it I would\r\nrequire the endorsement of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Lloyd George\r\nquickly answered, \"That can be done,\" and promptly took the note and\r\nwrote his name on the back of it. It remains in my possession as a\r\nsouvenir.\r\n\r\nThe following Sunday, Sir Charles and Lady Henry again invited us to\r\nluncheon, this time to their country home near Maidenhead, to meet Sir\r\nRufus and Lady Isaacs. Sir Rufus is now Lord Reading, and it was then\r\nquite well understood that he would be appointed Lord Chief Justice. He\r\nexpressed great interest in our parliamentary system as compared with\r\nthat of Great Britain, but thought the British method had an advantage\r\nover ours in that members of the Cabinet were at the same time members\r\nof Parliament and could advocate their own measures, and that in England\r\na Cabinet member must be not only an administrator, but a\r\nparliamentarian as well. He was very anxious to know how administrative\r\nmeasures in our country are brought forward and enacted into laws. I\r\nexplained our system to him and told him I thought the system of\r\nquestioning in Parliament members of the Cabinet left very little\r\nopportunity for the Cabinet members to devote themselves to the\r\nadministrative work of their departments.\r\n\r\nDuring this stay in London, I again had several pleasant meetings with\r\nPostmaster-General Herbert Samuel, whom I had visited when I passed\r\nthrough London on my return from Constantinople in 1910. He informed me\r\nthat within a month he intended visiting Canada and then the United\r\nStates. Later in the year I met him in my own country, where he\r\ndelivered several public addresses and made a fine impression.\r\n\r\nWhile we were at tea one afternoon on the terrace of the House of\r\nCommons with Mr. and Mrs. Samuel, the Right Honorable John Burns,\r\npresident of the Local Government Board, joined us. He knew both my\r\nbrothers and was pleased to meet me. He asked me to accompany him to\r\nhis department, which is only a short distance from Westminster Hall. As\r\nwe passed the entrance to Westminster, he said to me:\r\n\r\n\"Let us stop here and let me give you a graphic page of British\r\nhistory.\"\r\n\r\nSo we halted for about ten minutes under the scaffolding of the men who\r\nwere doing some repair work on the edifice, while Burns discoursed\r\neloquently on the well-known facts of British history. I was as much\r\ninterested in the man as in the great Gothic structure, and my mind went\r\non to review the march of democracy from the booted and spurred Cromwell\r\nto the radical labor leader John Burns. The radicalism of Burns was at\r\none time considered dangerous, but on entering the Cabinet he became\r\nconservative and reliable, proving the effect of responsibility upon\r\neven the more radical minds when in office.\r\n\r\nAcross the Thames Burns pointed to some factories, saying: \"There is\r\nwhere my father worked as a day laborer, and where I worked.\" And I was\r\nindeed impressed with the democracy of Great Britain in our day.\r\n\r\nWe spent a charming evening with Mr. and Mrs. Harry Brittain, now Sir\r\nHarry and Lady Brittain, in their cozy home on Cowley Street. The only\r\nother guest was Earl Grey, former Governor-General of Canada. Earlier in\r\nthe year I had met both Sir Harry Brittain and Earl Grey in New York,\r\nwhen they came over respectively as chairman and secretary of the\r\nBritish committee for the Celebration of One Hundred Years of Peace.\r\n\r\nA few days thereafter Earl Grey invited Mrs. Brittain, Mrs. Straus, and\r\nme to breakfast with him and then to accompany him to the now famous\r\nHampstead Garden Suburb. I was glad of this opportunity to see that\r\nexperiment, because the subject of housing workers in wholesome homes\r\nand surroundings at a moderate cost was one that interested me very\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\nHampstead is only about five or six miles from the heart of London. In\r\nthis beautiful suburb, every house has a garden, and the architecture of\r\nthe houses is varied and attractive. Earl Grey knew several of the\r\ntenants, and took us into a number of the houses. At that time the\r\nrental of an entire house per week was six and a half shillings and\r\nupward; and there were large single rooms with cooking facilities for\r\nthree and a half shillings a week. The population was almost seven\r\nthousand, and the suburb was being extended. There was an air of\r\ncontentment about the place, and the children looked robust and happy.\r\nThe wonder of it all was that the plan was on an economically sound\r\nbasis and was paying four and a half per cent annually on the capital\r\ninvested. The Earl had much to do with the development of this suburb\r\nand, if I mistake not, was chairman of the board at the time.\r\n\r\nMrs. Straus and I were also invited to spend a week-end with Earl and\r\nLady Grey at Howick, their Northumberland estate. Mrs. Straus, however,\r\nhad planned to take a cure at a German health resort, so my son Roger\r\nwas invited in her stead. The only other visitor was Henry Vivian, M.P.,\r\nwho was associated with Earl Grey in both the Hampstead Garden Suburb\r\nand the organization of the cooperative societies, of which latter Earl\r\nGrey was chairman. I participated in a meeting of the Cooperative\r\nSociety of Northern England and saw how practical and inexpensively\r\nconducted they were, cheapening merchandise of all kinds by eliminating\r\nthe profits of middlemen and the cost of distribution, and to that\r\nextent lowering the cost of living. Along these lines we have much to\r\nlearn in our own country.\r\n\r\nRoger and I spent a delightful few days with Earl and Lady Grey. The\r\nEarl represented the finest type of English nobleman. He was a man of\r\nthe highest ideals, even regarded by some as rather visionary in his\r\nvarious plans for the betterment of economic conditions; a man who\r\nrecognized, as do so many of the British titled people, the patriotic\r\nresponsibilities attached to their position.\r\n\r\nI now proceeded to the northern part of Scotland to spend a few days\r\nwith Andrew Carnegie at Skibo Castle in Sutherland. It was what Andrew\r\nCarnegie called \"university week\" at Skibo, for in accordance with an\r\nannual custom he had as his guests the provosts of the several Scotch\r\nuniversities.\r\n\r\nEvery morning we were awakened by the music of several Scotch\r\nhighlanders dressed in their kilts and playing old native tunes on their\r\nbagpipes. Those were unique and memorable awakenings in the\r\nsteel-master's castle; the bagpipes attuned the mind instantly to the\r\nScotch atmosphere and Scotch tradition. We started our day invariably\r\nwith a game of golf, at which we helped each other out as caddies, for\r\nall of us, Mr. Carnegie included, were indifferent players (beyond which\r\nstage I have not even since progressed), so that we all felt quite at\r\nhome with one another on the links.\r\n\r\nWe had hoped to test Carnegie's much-lauded and far-famed salmon pond,\r\nbut that season the fish were late in coming up the run, so we were\r\ndeprived of that pleasure and had to console ourselves with a little\r\ntrout fishing. Two or three were put into each of our baskets for\r\nbreakfast, and the remainder were religiously restored to the pond.\r\n\r\nAt that time Skibo Castle had but recently been built, but already it\r\nwas noted for its generous hospitality, which both the British and\r\nAmerican friends of Mr. Carnegie so much enjoyed.\r\n\r\nI had promised Mr. Carnegie that I would attend the ceremonies opening\r\nthe Peace Palace at The Hague, to which all the members of the Hague\r\nTribunal had been specially invited. From Skibo, therefore, I returned\r\nto London, to meet my old friend Hakki Pasha, who was one of the Turkish\r\nmembers of the Tribunal, and together we went on to The Hague.\r\n\r\nA word about the origin of the Peace Palace may not prove tedious.\r\nShortly after the close of the first Hague Conference in 1899 the late\r\nProfessor Martens, distinguished Russian international jurist, had a\r\ntalk with our ambassador at Berlin, Andrew D. White, who had been\r\nchairman of the American delegation at that conference. Together they\r\ndiscussed the desirability of a building at The Hague which should serve\r\nas a \"palace of justice\" for the Permanent Court and as a place of\r\nmeetings for international conferences. Subsequently Ambassador White\r\npresented the idea to Andrew Carnegie, and Carnegie invited him to come\r\nto Skibo to discuss it. Ambassador White records in his \"Autobiography\":\r\n\r\n     The original idea had developed into something far greater. The\r\n     Peace Palace at The Hague began to reappear in a new glory--as a\r\n     pledge and sign of a better future for the world. Then there came\r\n     from Carnegie the words which assured his great gift to the\r\n     nations--the creation of a center as a symbol of a world's desire\r\n     for peace and of good will to man.\r\n\r\nThe programme for the dedication was in keeping with the occasion. The\r\ncity itself was decorated with festive drapery and floral arches. It was\r\na beautiful day and great crowds of people had gathered. The great\r\nconference hall and the galleries of the Palace were filled with\r\nrepresentatives of the nations: the diplomatic corps; about forty\r\nmembers of the Permanent Court; members of the States General of\r\nHolland; the Queen; Prince Henry; the Queen Mother, and many ladies;\r\naltogether an imposing assembly.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony opened with the singing of anthems by the choir from\r\nAmsterdam. An historical address was made by the former Minister of\r\nForeign Affairs, Jonkheer van Karnebeek, president of the Carnegie\r\nBuilding Foundation. His son, by the way, is Minister of Foreign Affairs\r\nat this writing and was Holland's chief representative at the Washington\r\nConference of 1921. Mr. Van Swinderen, the retiring Minister of Foreign\r\nAffairs, made the address accepting the custody of the building.\r\n\r\nIn the evening a banquet to Mr. Carnegie was given in the Hall of\r\nKnights at Binnenhof by the Minister of Foreign Affairs in the name of\r\nthe Government, to which were invited the nobility and all the high\r\nofficials who had attended the ceremony, and who thereafter were\r\nreceived in audience by the Queen at the Royal Palace.\r\n\r\nThe greatest possible distinction was shown to both Mr. and Mrs.\r\nCarnegie, who were brimming over with gratification. Well known as\r\nCarnegie was as one of the greatest captains of industry, he is even\r\nbetter known, and will be longer remembered throughout the world, by the\r\nextent of his benefactions, in the distribution of which he found his\r\nsupreme happiness in the last two decades of his life.\r\n\r\nWhen the World War began, the cartoonists made much sport of the Peace\r\nPalace as the outstanding embodiment of the irony of fate, and with the\r\npeace advocates for the failure of their vision. But evidence is not\r\nentirely lacking that the peace advocates may yet be able to turn the\r\nlaugh on the cartoonists. Some of the most constructive features of the\r\nLeague of Nations were formulated by commissions working under the roof\r\nof the Peace Palace. The International Court of Justice, organized\r\nunder the provisions of the covenant of the League of Nations, has its\r\nseat within the Palace and will soon be ready to commence its\r\nconstructive work. The Palace is a contribution whose worth to\r\ncivilization can hardly be measured in a single generation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the fall of that year we returned to New York, but only for a few\r\nmonths. When Kermit Roosevelt became engaged to Miss Willard, charming\r\ndaughter of our ambassador to Spain, my wife promised him that unless we\r\nwere unavoidably prevented, we should be present at his marriage in\r\nMadrid early in the following June. We had become very much attached to\r\nour young friend, whom we got to know so well during his stay with us at\r\nConstantinople.\r\n\r\nOn May 19, 1914, we returned to Europe on the S.S. Lusitania. On board\r\nwe were agreeably surprised to find our long-time friend, Mrs. T. J.\r\nPreston, Jr., formerly Mrs. Grover Cleveland, seated at our table in the\r\ndining-saloon. She was traveling alone and was to meet her husband and\r\ndaughter in London. Naturally we spoke of Cleveland and of his qualities\r\nas they had revealed themselves to her and to his more intimate friends.\r\nWhen a man is President and always in the limelight, people get a\r\nperverted impression of him, a fact true more or less since Washington's\r\nday, but perhaps to a greater degree in the case of Cleveland. Mrs.\r\nPreston referred to many incidents that illustrated his gentleness and\r\nconsideration, and she gave credit to his advice and guidance for much\r\nof the tact she displayed as mistress of the White House, for she was\r\nscarcely out of her teens when she occupied that important post.\r\n\r\nIn London I received a letter from Roosevelt saying he would meet us in\r\nParis on June 7th, and suggesting that I keep in touch with our embassy\r\nthere. Miss Catherine Page also was going to the wedding to be one of\r\nthe bridesmaids, and Ambassador Page asked us to take her with us, which\r\nof course we were glad to do.\r\n\r\nWe stayed in London for several days, and soon after our arrival, there\r\nwas a young people's dance at the embassy to which the ambassador asked\r\nus to come if only for a short stay. There we met Mr. and Mrs. Rudyard\r\nKipling. In the course of a pleasant chat, I asked Kipling in what work\r\nhe was then engaged.\r\n\r\nKipling pointed to the next room at the dancing, and said: \"Sitting up\r\nlate nights as I have a daughter in society, which is my principal\r\noccupation at present.\"\r\n\r\nI spent an evening with Israel Zangwill, during which he unfolded to me\r\na plan he was formulating to call a conference of representative Jews\r\nfrom various countries to form a central committee which was to be more\r\ninternationally representative than the Alliance Israelite of Paris,\r\nwhich is in reality dominantly French and therefore does not represent\r\nthe world of Israel in an international sense. Such a body was to\r\nprotect, defend, and plead for the cause of the Jews wherever necessary\r\nand to speak in behalf of the Jewry of the world. He said he had talked\r\nit over with his colleagues and they wanted me to take the presidency of\r\nsuch a body because of my experience in statesmanship and world\r\ndiplomacy. I took care not to discourage him, but told him I should have\r\nto consider the matter, because with me personality sank out of sight\r\nwhen an important cause was to be carried forward.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived in Paris, a note awaited us from Ambassador Herrick\r\nasking us to come to the embassy, and informing us that Roosevelt was\r\nthere. When I arrived I found Roosevelt in the smoking-room engaged in\r\nan animated conversation with ex-Premier Hanotaux regarding the physical\r\ncharacteristics of the races of Europe, in which Henri Bergson also\r\nparticipated, and to which the sculptor Rodin appeared to be a bored\r\nlistener. Roosevelt was talking French, and when he could not find the\r\nword he wanted, he used an English term for which Bergson would then\r\ngive him the French equivalent.\r\n\r\nThe next day our party left for Madrid--Roosevelt, his daughter Alice,\r\ntheir cousin Philip, son of William Emlen Roosevelt, Miss Page, Mrs.\r\nStraus, and myself. We were a jolly party.\r\n\r\nRoosevelt and I, of course, talked politics, especially the future of\r\nthe Progressive Party. The State campaign for Governor and United States\r\nSenator was being discussed when Roosevelt left home, and he had given\r\nout an interview before sailing regarding the sort of men that should be\r\nchosen, in which he had kindly referred to me as the standard of nominee\r\nfor Senator. The press had commented extensively and favorably upon such\r\na choice and there had appeared many articles and editorials giving\r\nconsideration to my name. Roosevelt had, of course, referred to me only\r\nas the type of man to be chosen, and believed that if the nominee for\r\nGovernor were chosen from New York City, it might be well to choose the\r\ncandidate for Senator from up-State. I told him I had no personal vanity\r\nin the matter, that what we wanted was the candidates that would best\r\nembody the cause. He answered that he knew me well enough for that, but\r\nthat every one agreed that next to him I was the most prominent\r\nProgressive, and in New York State even stronger than he, as shown by\r\nthe election of 1912. Of course I did not agree with this generous\r\nstatement, which was another proof that figures do sometimes lie.\r\n\r\nHe expressed the hope that the Progressives and the liberal wing of the\r\nRepublicans might unite. He lamented the difficulties for the party in\r\nthe coming election, and said he was reluctant to enter the campaign,\r\nbut, he added: \"I must stand by the men who stood by me.\" If Johnson was\r\nagain to be the candidate of the party for Governor of California and\r\nneeded his help, he would have to go there, though he could not overtax\r\nhis throat, which had been weakened by his fever in the jungles of\r\nBrazil. He said if that fever had overtaken him two weeks earlier, he\r\nwould not have pulled through; as it was, he had had a narrow escape.\r\n\r\nAt Irun, the Spanish border, King Alphonso's private car was hitched on\r\nto our train. From there on to the King's summer palace, where he left\r\nthe train, a small guard of honor was drawn up at every stopping-place\r\nand the chief officials of the district came to pay their respects to\r\ntheir sovereign. The King was only twenty-eight years old, but was\r\ngenerally conceded to be a man of ability, with enlightened views, and\r\nhighly regarded by his subjects. However, among the random notes that I\r\nmade at the end of this visit to Spain, I wrote:\r\n\r\n     I very much doubt if monarchy will last another score of years in\r\n     Spain unless the King takes a lesson from Great Britain and is\r\n     content to have Parliament govern the country. The democratic\r\n     spirit is rapidly growing, but I very much doubt if the people with\r\n     their long traditions of monarchical government, will be prepared\r\n     for many years for a democratic form of government.\r\n\r\nThe most powerful man in Parliament, though out of the Ministry at the\r\ntime, was the late Premier Maurer. The Conservatives were in power, but\r\ntheir tenure was precarious. It was said that Maurer's ancestors several\r\ngenerations ago were Jews, which is also true of several members of the\r\nnobility, whose ancestors were converted during the period of the\r\nInquisition.\r\n\r\nOur ambassador and his staff of secretaries were at the station in\r\nMadrid to meet us. The Roosevelts went to the embassy and we went to the\r\nRitz Hotel. At eleven o'clock on the morning of June 10th, the civil\r\nmarriage took place in the Prefecture of Police before a district judge.\r\nIt was a simple proceeding, attended only by the immediate family and a\r\nfew intimate friends, perhaps a dozen in all. The ceremony was read from\r\na book in which was included the marriage contract. The bride and groom\r\nand four witnesses then signed the contract, the witnesses on this\r\noccasion being the father of the bride, the father of the groom, and two\r\nSpanish noblemen.\r\n\r\nThe following day at high noon the religious ceremony was performed in\r\nthe chapel of the British embassy. There were about seventy-five persons\r\npresent: the diplomatic corps, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and\r\nseveral other Spanish officials, and some friends. After the ceremony,\r\nthere was a wedding breakfast at the embassy. The Roosevelts left that\r\nsame evening for Paris, and I did not see them again in Europe.\r\n\r\nThis was our second visit to Spain. In 1897 my wife and I had been there\r\nfor about a week, and many of the men with whom we had spent pleasant\r\nhours at that time were now no longer living. Chief among these were Sir\r\nHenry Drummond Wolff and Signor Castelar. Sir Henry, who was British\r\nambassador to Spain at the time, I had not seen since he was special\r\nenvoy to Turkey in 1888, and I remember how delighted he was to see us\r\nagain and how very much at home he made us feel. We also met Lady Wolff\r\nthen, who, however, was not well. She told us of some of her experiences\r\nin Persia; also that Sir Henry was very ill there, having been poisoned\r\nat a dinner given by the Shah.\r\n\r\nAnother colleague of my first Turkish mission whom I had found at Madrid\r\nin 1897 was Herr von Radowitz, German ambassador. He invited us to dine\r\none evening at the embassy, and after dinner showed us the throne room\r\nin which hung a picture of the Kaiser. Radowitz explained that it was\r\npainted by a friend of the Emperor, \"somewhat theatrical, you see, but\r\nhe is fond of appearing grandiose.\" He started to tell me how he came\r\ninto possession of the painting, that he had told the Emperor that the\r\nembassy had no likeness of him, but he corrected himself by saying: \"No,\r\nI did not ask for the picture, my wife did.\" He displayed rather a\r\nslighting estimate of his sovereign. The fact was that he was a protege\r\nof Bismarck, and after the latter's retirement Radowitz was transferred\r\nfrom Constantinople to Madrid, which was regarded in the nature of a\r\ndemotion, and that perhaps largely accounted for his attitude.\r\n\r\nAs we conversed after dinner, Radowitz made the remark that in 1878 he\r\nwas one of the secretaries to the Berlin Congress and that there he met\r\nDisraeli. Disraeli always made specially prepared speeches in English,\r\nwhich Radowitz took down in French. Then Disraeli would compliment him\r\nand say, \"Did I really speak in this nice way or did you only write me\r\ndown so elegantly?\" When Radowitz replied, \"Yes, this is what you said,\"\r\nDisraeli would say, \"So let it stand.\"\r\n\r\nThis led me to draw out Sir Henry, who was also present, regarding\r\nDisraeli. He had known Disraeli very well. He told me that at the age of\r\ntwelve he had met Disraeli and had always had access to him. I asked Sir\r\nHenry whether he had not kept a diary. He said he had not, but wished\r\nthat he had. \"Dizzy,\" he said, was not a compromiser; if he had\r\nopponents, he recognized them as such and never sought to placate them.\r\nWhen he first entered Parliament he was a brilliant, flowery speaker, so\r\nmuch so that his party, the Conservative, was afraid of him. Afterward,\r\nwhen he became a member of the Ministry, he had trained himself down to\r\na rather prosy level, yet now and again his speech would glow with\r\nbrilliant passages excoriating his opponent. He was quick at repartee\r\nand often held up the other side to ridicule in telling metaphor.\r\n\r\nI asked Sir Henry about Dizzy's loyalty to Judaism. He said Dizzy never\r\ndenied it, holding up especially the race idea. I remarked that in\r\nreading such of Disraeli's novels as \"Coningsby\" and \"Tancred,\" and in\r\nthe Proceedings of the Berlin Congress, I was impressed with his race\r\nloyalty and his purpose to secure equal political rights for the\r\noppressed members of his race in the newly constituted Balkan States.\r\n\r\nSir Henry answered me: \"I don't recall the novels, but what you say was\r\ntrue, although of course his loyalty was to England first. Dizzy's idea\r\nwas that the race should amalgamate.\"\r\n\r\nI wanted to know whether he recollected when Disraeli's novels first\r\ncame out. He said he remembered all but \"Vivian Grey,\" which Dizzy wrote\r\nwhen he was quite young. He added that Disraeli's writings made him\r\nquite a lion among the literary set, but did not help him politically.\r\nHe wanted to count among the best socially, and ever pointed his\r\npolitical guns toward that target.\r\n\r\nWhen I asked Sir Henry about Disraeli's personal appearance, he said:\r\n\"Lord Dufferin (Frederic Blackwood) looked very much like him; so much\r\nso that he might have been taken for Disraeli's son. Dizzy and Mrs.\r\nBlackwood were said to be very good friends. He met her on many of his\r\nfrequent visits to the home of Lady Blessington, during the period when\r\nhe was beginning to gain popularity.\"\r\n\r\nSir Henry had been rather critical of Disraeli, but he ended by saying:\r\n\"Taking Dizzy all in all, he was the greatest English statesman I have\r\never known.\" And to me Disraeli had always been a fascinating subject,\r\nso much so, indeed, that at one time I had the intention to write a\r\nbiography of him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith Emilio Castelar I had come into correspondence following the\r\npublication of the French edition of my \"Origin of the Republican Form\r\nof Government in the United States,\" in which he was much interested. He\r\nexpressed the hope that the next time I came to Europe we might meet,\r\nand when I came to Madrid, Mr. Reed, for many years secretary of our\r\nlegation there, made an appointment for me, and accompanied Mrs. Straus\r\nand me to his home.\r\n\r\nHe was a short, rather stout man of sixty-five, bald, with dark skin and\r\nsparkling brown eyes, and a gray moustache. He was a bachelor. We spoke\r\nFrench, and though it was an ordinary conversation he was quite\r\noratorical. He said he was a republican and believed thoroughly in\r\nconservative republicanism such as we had in the United States, but that\r\nSpain was not ripe for republicanism, and that he had parted company\r\nwith the Spanish republicans because he could not endure their\r\nprinciples; they were ready to pull down, but not to build up; they were\r\nanarchists, and not republicans.\r\n\r\nHe presented Mrs. Straus with his photograph, and when she asked him to\r\nautograph it, he returned to his study and wrote in Spanish on the back\r\nof it a charming sentiment regarding us and our country. He was anxious\r\nto have us come and take Spanish dinner with him, but unfortunately we\r\nwere leaving that evening for Seville.\r\n\r\nI was interested in some articles Castelar had written for the \"Century\r\nMagazine\" in 1892-93 regarding Columbus, and especially in those of the\r\narticles in which he referred to the expulsion of the Jews from Spain. I\r\nasked him whether he had finished the work, and he told me he had\r\nbrought it out complete in book form in Spanish, in which he had dwelt\r\nmore fully on the Jewish expulsion and had published a number of facts\r\nfrom original research made for the work, though not by himself. He went\r\nto his study to give me a copy of the book, but found that he had none\r\non hand. He promised to send me one in a few days through Mr. Reed,\r\nwhich he did.\r\n\r\nThe expulsion of the Spanish Jews was of great interest to me, and on\r\nthis second visit to Madrid I took advantage of the opportunity to see\r\nsome of the historical relics from that period. I got in touch with Dr.\r\nAngel Pulido, life senator of Spain, and together with Professor A. S.\r\nYahuda, we visited the historic city of Toledo, about two and a half\r\nhours by rail out of Madrid. Dr. Pulido had for years advocated measures\r\nto induce Jews to return to Spain, especially those who still retained\r\nthe Spanish language, as do many in Turkey and nearly all those in\r\nMorocco who are the descendants of those driven out of Spain.\r\n\r\nToledo is one of the most ancient cities of Spain. It was once the\r\nresidence of the kings of Castile, and under the Moors had a population\r\nof some two hundred thousand, of whom seventy-five thousand were\r\nestimated to have been Jews. The population now is about twenty\r\nthousand, and the city is but the bedraggled remains of its former\r\ngrandeur. In its ancient glory it was noted for its silk and woolen\r\nindustries and for the manufacture of the famous Toledo steel from which\r\nwere made swords and other weapons that rivaled those of Damascus; and\r\nit was the home of a number of Jewish scholars and noted men, Eben Ezra\r\n(1119-74), for instance.\r\n\r\nThere are two old synagogues in the city which I was anxious to see. One\r\nwas erected at the end of the twelfth or beginning of the thirteenth\r\ncentury, and was converted into a church in 1405. It is called Santa\r\nMaria la Blanca. Its architecture is of the best Moorish style; the\r\ninterior has twenty-eight horseshoe arches borne by thirty-two octagonal\r\npiers, and the elaborate capitals are ornamented with pine cones.\r\n\r\nIn the same district, near by, is the Sinagoga del Transito, of similar\r\nstyle, erected about 1360. It was built at the expense of one Samuel\r\nLevy, treasurer of Peter the Cruel, who was afterward executed by order\r\nof his king. The walls of the interior were decorated with Hebrew\r\nwriting, mainly passages from the Psalms. In 1492 this synagogue was\r\nturned over to the Calatrava Order of Knights, and many members of this\r\norder lie buried in the body of the building. Later the synagogue was\r\nconsecrated to the death of the virgin.\r\n\r\nNear these synagogues also was the Casa del Greco (House of the Greek),\r\nso called because the famous Greek painter, Dominico Theotocopuli,\r\nforerunner of the impressionists, lived there. Among his pictures is a\r\nlarge one of an \"auto da fe\" which took place in the main square of the\r\ncity, and the square when I saw it still looked much the same as in the\r\npainting. The picture shows the balconies of the houses surrounding the\r\nsquare filled with eager and gay spectators who had come to witness and\r\nenjoy the burning of Jewish heretics. They must have assembled in about\r\nthe same spirit as fashionable people of a later day came to the bull\r\nfights. In the picture the procession is entering the enclosure where\r\nare seated the members of the Holy Office, or inquisitors, at whose side\r\nstand the officers holding torches with which to light the pyre on which\r\nthe condemned victims were bound. As I gazed at the square, I could\r\ngraphically visualize the scene portrayed in the picture. Such cruelty\r\nand perversion inevitably presaged the spiritual as well as the material\r\ndecadence of the inhabitants of the Iberian Peninsula.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBy the courtesy of Senator Pulido, I met and had several conferences\r\nwith the Marques de Dosfuentes, who several years before, as Fernando de\r\nAnton del Olmet, had written an article entitled \"La verdadera patrio de\r\nCristobal Colon,\" which was published in \"La Espana Moderna,\" a leading\r\nmonthly of Spain.\r\n\r\nI was very much interested in the data that several of the historians of\r\nSpain had unearthed regarding the ancestry and place of origin of\r\nColumbus. The article by the Marquis just mentioned was based on the\r\nresearch made by Celso Garcia de la Riega, and both Olmet and Riega came\r\nto the conclusion, based upon their examination of records, that\r\nColumbus was not an Italian, but a Spaniard, and that he was born in\r\nPontevedra, Galicia, in the northern part of Spain; that his father's\r\nname was Colon (the Spanish for Columbus), and his mother's name\r\nFonterosa; and that he was of Jewish ancestry.\r\n\r\nIn his article Olmet says, after going into detail regarding the\r\nnationality of Columbus according to the documents which he was able to\r\nexamine:\r\n\r\n     Nothing seems more logical than the preceding reasoning, and,\r\n     moreover, this is the simplest method of explaining that the\r\n     Admiral's parents were a Colon and a Fonterosa, which gives us a\r\n     clue to the mystery of his life. From the document under notice it\r\n     is to be inferred that Domingo de Colon named was a modest trader.\r\n     If the admiral was his son, it would not be absurd to suppose that,\r\n     given the social prejudices of the times, this should have been a\r\n     sufficient motive for hiding his origin and country. But there is\r\n     still another reason that fully justifies his secrecy and clears up\r\n     all mystery. The patronymic \"Fonterosa\" appears in the Province of\r\n     Pontevedra connected with the names of Jacob the elder, another\r\n     Jacob, and Benjamin; Colon's mother was called Susana. \"If the\r\n     admiral belonged to this family, doubtless Jewish,\" says Sg. La\r\n     Riega, \"since we may draw this inference from the Biblical names,\r\n     or if he belonged to a family of new Christians, should we not\r\n     forgive his action in the matter and declare him fully justified in\r\n     his resolution not to reveal such antecedents? We must bear in mind\r\n     the then existing hatred toward the Hebrew race and the merciless\r\n     fury let loose against it in the latter half of the fifteenth\r\n     century.\"\r\n\r\nIn another part of the article Olmet says:\r\n\r\n     Colon never mentioned any relative, paternal or maternal. Even when\r\n     Colon was at the zenith of his fame no one in Italy came forward to\r\n     claim relationship with him, although he was the most famous\r\n     personage of that time. Thus everything goes to corroborate Don\r\n     Fernando Colon's affirmation in his \"Life of the Admiral\" that his\r\n     father wished his origin and birthplace to remain unknown.\r\n\r\nThe research of La Riega was continued to 1914 and published in that\r\nyear. The author died early in the year, shortly before I arrived in\r\nMadrid. Other Spanish historians also have published conclusions similar\r\nto those of La Riega. There was, for instance, a brochure by Enrique de\r\nArribas y Turull, entitled \"Cristobal Colon, Natural de Pontevedra,\"\r\nwhich was originally delivered as a lecture before the Madrid Historical\r\nSociety. This also sums up, in nineteen points, the reasons for the\r\nconclusion that Columbus was a Spaniard, and of Jewish ancestry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE WORLD WAR\r\n\r\n     Paris throbs with the _Marseillaise_--A British railway conductor\r\n     refuses a five-pound note--Americans panic-stricken in London--A\r\n     special committee to aid Americans in Europe--The embassy\r\n     committee--Mr. and Mrs. Herbert C.

Accordingly we hurried\r\nto Paris and in the course of twenty-four hours the whole aspect of the\r\ncity had changed. From the windows of our hotel on the Place Vendome and\r\non the principal boulevards of the city we saw youths of military age\r\nmarching to headquarters. The air throbbed with the _Marseillaise_.\r\nEverywhere there were crowds, but they were neither boisterous nor\r\nhilarious. Everywhere there was an air of tension and determination,\r\nvastly unlike the usual mood of jovial, happy Paris.\r\n\r\nStarting at once for London, we found the trains so overcrowded that it\r\nwas impossible to get accommodations, so we motored to Dieppe and\r\nreached there in time to take the boat that left at three o'clock in the\r\nmorning for Newhaven. The ordinary capacity of the boat was five hundred\r\npassengers, but it was packed from stem to stern with some two thousand\r\npersons on this voyage, mainly Americans. The Calais-Dover crossing of\r\nthe Channel had already been suspended.\r\n\r\nOn board the train from Newhaven to London, a curious incident occurred\r\nthat indicated the derangement of things. I had four fares to pay,\r\namounting to about three pounds. I handed the conductor a five-pound\r\nBank of England note. He took it, but shortly returned with it, saying\r\nhe could accept nothing but gold. I expostulated with him, told him I\r\nhad no gold, and since a bank note was valid tender I insisted upon its\r\nacceptance. But the upshot was that he preferred to take my card with my\r\nLondon address!\r\n\r\nIt would appear that my credit at that moment was better than that of\r\nthe Bank of England.\r\n\r\nWe arrived in London on Sunday, August 2d. At the Hyde Park Hotel, to\r\nwhich we went, a typewritten notice was posted announcing a meeting on\r\nthe following day at the Waldorf Hotel on the Strand. The persons who\r\nsigned the notice were unknown to me, and at first I was inclined to pay\r\nno attention to it. However, I did go, and found gathered inside and in\r\nfront of the hotel several thousand stranded Americans. The main hall\r\nand all approaches to it were packed. Several persons in the crowd\r\nrecognized me and made a passageway so that I could get into the room\r\nwhere the meeting was being held. Upon my entrance I was lifted upon a\r\ntable that served as a platform, and was asked to speak. I made a short\r\naddress to the panic-stricken assembly, assured them they had nothing to\r\nfear and were as safe in London as if they were in New York, and that\r\nour committee would remain with them and help them get suitable\r\ntransportation as early as practicable. There was loud cheering and my\r\nwords seemed to have a comforting effect.\r\n\r\nImmediately thereafter a group of us came together and organized a\r\nspecial committee for the aid of Americans in Europe. There were\r\nFrederick I. Kent, one of the vice-presidents of the Bankers' Trust\r\nCompany; W. N. Duane, another vice-president of the Bankers' Trust\r\nCompany; Theodore Hetzler, a vice-president of the Fifth Avenue Bank;\r\nJoseph P. Day, a prominent real estate auctioneer of New York City;\r\nWilliam C. Breed, an officer of the Merchants' Association; Chandler P.\r\nAnderson and James Byrne, prominent American lawyers, several others,\r\nand myself. We arranged for headquarters at the Hotel Savoy, where\r\nseveral of the largest salons were placed at our disposal so that we had\r\nroom for the various departments that needed to be formed to attend to\r\nthe wants of the many terrified Americans who were pouring into London\r\nfrom all over the Continent. Mr. Hetzler was chairman of the general\r\ncommittee, Mr. Duane secretary, and Robert W. DeForest, vice-president\r\nof the American Red Cross, was member _ex-officio_. I was made chairman\r\nof the embassy committee of which Ambassador Page was honorary chairman,\r\nand the American ambassadors to France, Germany, Austria, and the\r\nministers to Holland and Belgium were made advisory members. We found\r\nmany willing helpers, including a number of professors from American\r\nuniversities and other public-spirited men and women.\r\n\r\nThe necessary sub-committees were speedily formed: Mr. Day was made\r\nchairman of the transportation committee and got in touch with the\r\nmanagers of all the transatlantic steamship companies. Mr. Kent was\r\nchairman of the finance committee, and through his banking connections\r\nwas able to get a limited amount of gold to advance to those who could\r\nnot convert their foreign money, notwithstanding the moratorium that had\r\nbeen declared which made it impossible for several days to get ready\r\nmoney; foreign bills were not being accepted by the banks. With the\r\ndeclaration of the moratorium we at once called a meeting of the\r\nmanagers of the hotels where most of the Americans were stopping, and\r\nwithout exception these men were very accommodating. They agreed not to\r\nrequire payment from their American guests for the time being, and as\r\nfar as possible to advance them a little money to meet their immediate\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\nOur embassy was crowded from morning to night with hundreds of citizens,\r\nmost of whom wanted to make application for passports, for the steamship\r\ncompanies required the exhibition of passports before arranging for\r\ntransportation. The rooms at the embassy were not large enough to\r\naccommodate the crowds that filled them, so we transferred the passport\r\ndivision to the Hotel Savoy, and Ambassador Page assigned to me several\r\nclerks to facilitate the handling of our business. I am sorry to say\r\nthere was a tendency on the part of many American travelers to find\r\nfault with our ambassador and the embassy. This was not at all\r\njustified, and I took every occasion to assure them that the ambassador\r\nwas doing all in his power with his limited staff, and that our\r\ncommittee had his fullest cooperation and was getting his aid in every\r\npossible way. I consulted with Ambassador Page almost every day, and\r\ntogether we planned for arranging for money and the many other\r\nrequirements of our citizens.\r\n\r\nIn those first hectic days, some of us worked all day and far into the\r\nnight, or rather into the next morning. Many British friends who visited\r\nour rooms marveled at the promptness and efficiency with which we\r\ndispatched business under the circumstances, and were solicitous for\r\nthe health of \"the unofficial ambassador,\" as I was being called, and\r\nhis staff.\r\n\r\nAfter the committee had been going a few days, it secured the\r\ncooperation of Mr. and Mrs. Herbert C. Hoover. He was chairman of an\r\nAmerican benevolent society, of the woman's committee of which Mrs.\r\nHoover was at the head. As the members of our relief committee returned\r\nhome, the work was by degrees turned over to Mr. and Mrs. Hoover and\r\ntheir associates, until by August 27th we put all of the remaining work\r\nand funds into the hands of their society.\r\n\r\nOne day Earl Grey paid me a visit at our headquarters, and with him was\r\nMrs. Waldorf Astor, now Viscountess Astor, who reminded me that \"all\r\nwork and no play makes Jack a dull boy,\" and insisted that Mrs. Straus\r\nand I spend the week-end at Cliveden, their residence, a short distance\r\nby rail out of London. Other guests were Earl Grey, Geoffrey Robinson,\r\neditor of the London \"Times,\" and several others connected with the\r\neditorship of \"The Round Table,\" a political quarterly.\r\n\r\nMr. Waldorf Astor was an earnest, modest young man, then about\r\nthirty-four years old, unspoiled by his enormous wealth. On the\r\ncontrary, he was and still is devoting much of his wealth as well as his\r\nparliamentary activities to philanthropic work, including the treatment\r\nand prevention of tuberculosis, and in this connection had been in touch\r\nwith my brother Nathan in regard to milk pasteurization.\r\n\r\nThere were several subsequent week-ends at Cliveden. On one of these\r\nvisits, a dozen or more young men were there, members of England's\r\nforemost families. They enjoyed themselves at tennis and other games and\r\non Monday were to join the colors. It is sad to record that most of\r\nthese fine fellows, with the exception of two or three, were killed or\r\nseriously wounded within the next few months.\r\n\r\nWhen England entered the war, the diplomatic correspondence was\r\npublished in what was called the British \"White Paper.\" Sir Edward Grey,\r\nnow Viscount Grey, had made a speech in Parliament, of which I read the\r\npublished version in this \"White Paper.\" It happened that on that very\r\nday Earl Grey, cousin to Sir Edward, was lunching with me at my hotel,\r\nand I took the occasion to point out to him the necessity of making\r\nclear, especially for the American public, that the reason England had\r\njoined the Allies was not only on Belgium's account, but to uphold the\r\nsanctity of international obligations. This concerned not alone the\r\nbelligerent nations, but all the nations. Without the sanctity of\r\ninternational obligations the war, no matter how it ended, would cause a\r\nreversion to a state of international barbarity. Earl Grey suggested\r\nthat I discuss the subject with his cousin, and arranged for a meeting.\r\nA few days later we three sat down to a simple and informal luncheon at\r\nEarl Grey's home on South Street, in Park Lane.\r\n\r\nSir Edward Grey spoke earnestly and frankly. He felt the great\r\nresponsibility of the decision that brought England into the war, and\r\nsaid he had often asked himself whether he could have done otherwise.\r\nThere was nothing chauvinistic in either his attitude or his arguments.\r\nIt was plain that he had weighed the entire issue carefully. His\r\nopen-mindedness, his simplicity and straightforwardness of manner, his\r\ngreat ability and humanitarian zeal, impressed me very much.\r\n\r\nI called his attention to the importance of having Russia grant civil\r\nand religious rights to her subject nationalities; the failure of such\r\naction would weaken the moral cause of the Allies, and also from an\r\nAmerican point of view it was important that Russia give some evidence\r\nof a liberal spirit, otherwise it might be feared that victory for the\r\nAllies would redound mainly to the advantage of autocracy in Russia. I\r\ncontended that it was not a question of humanity, but plain state\r\npolicy, and that it was important that the Governments of Great Britain\r\nand France bring Russia, as their ally, into line. I had received\r\nseveral cables from prominent men in New York and Boston who had thus\r\nexpressed the American point of view.\r\n\r\nThe conversation ran on for an hour and a half in a very informal way.\r\nEarl Grey then made the suggestion, in accordance with my remarks of a\r\nfew days before about the necessity of making clear England's position\r\nin entering the war, that I give out an interview to the American press\r\ncovering the substance of our conversation. I demurred. Naturally I\r\nhesitated to state publicly the delicate and critical questions that the\r\nBritish Minister of Foreign Affairs had so frankly discussed with me.\r\nHowever, Sir Edward himself said he would appreciate my doing so, for he\r\nhad perfect confidence in my doing it without embarrassment to his\r\ncountry. I therefore agreed to it, with the proviso that he approve the\r\ninterview before it was released for publication.\r\n\r\nI got in touch with the representatives of the American papers in London\r\nand that evening gave out the interview. The next morning I sent a copy\r\nto Sir Edward, who returned it to me without a single change, saying he\r\napproved both its form and content. The matter was then cabled to\r\nAmerica, published in our leading papers on August 15th, and cabled back\r\nfor republication in the British papers.\r\n\r\nThereafter the London papers came to me for further interviews, and in a\r\nsubsequent statement I dwelt more specifically on the importance of\r\nRussia's fair treatment of her subject nationalities, particularly the\r\nJews, who had suffered most. The press representatives asked whether\r\nthey might show my interview to Lord Weardale and if possible get his\r\ncomment, to which I gladly consented.\r\n\r\nLord Weardale had been head of the Parliamentary deputation that visited\r\nRussia the year before and had an intimate knowledge of Russian\r\nconditions. He told me later that he had already written the Russian\r\nMinister of Foreign Affairs, Sazonoff, along the identical lines of my\r\ninterview. He supplemented what I had stated, with an interview, saying,\r\namong other things:\r\n\r\n     It would be an immense step in the path of progress of Russia\r\n     herself and would create a profound sentiment of satisfaction in\r\n     the civilized world if the Tsar at such a juncture were to give\r\n     emphatic endorsement to his already declared intention to give full\r\n     religious liberty to all his peoples. It is not enough to be\r\n     powerful in the battlefield; it is even more important to conquer\r\n     the approval of the human conscience.\r\n\r\nThe Government and people of Great Britain were very solicitous at that\r\ntime regarding public opinion in America and the probable attitude of\r\nour Government. In many quarters there was a feeling of uncertainty and\r\neven of misgiving toward the statement by President Wilson respecting an\r\noffer of mediation at the opportune moment, in accordance with the\r\nprovisions of the Hague Treaty. Because of this and other\r\nconsiderations, Sir Edward Grey and others recognized the importance of\r\nhaving Russia give evidence of a more enlightened spirit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe left London at the end of August, and upon arrival home went up to\r\nHartsdale, a short distance out of New York, to visit with our son. A\r\nfew days afterward Mr. James Speyer, whose summer home was but a few\r\nmiles distant, at Scarboro, telephoned, inviting Mrs. Straus and myself\r\nto dine with him. Mrs. Speyer had not returned from abroad; the guests\r\nwere Mr. and Mrs. Frank A. Vanderlip and Count von Bernstorff. As Mrs.\r\nStraus was rather worn out by her London experience, I went alone. There\r\nwere several other neighbors, Mr. Frank H. Platt and Mr. Frank Trumbull\r\nand perhaps one other, about eight of us, of whom Mrs. Vanderlip was the\r\nonly lady.\r\n\r\nBernstorff I had known for a number of years. I had first met him in\r\n1888 when I was on my first mission to Turkey and he was attache of the\r\nGerman embassy. Later he came to Washington as ambassador when I was in\r\nthe Cabinet, and we met frequently there.\r\n\r\nThe conversation at dinner was general, although it was inevitable that\r\nwe discuss the war. Bernstorff voiced the usual claim of the Germans,\r\nthat they did not want war, and that the Kaiser and the German\r\nGovernment stood for peace. When he had dilated upon that theme I asked\r\nhim:\r\n\r\n\"Is that the present sentiment and attitude of your country?\"\r\n\r\nHe replied that it certainly was when he left Berlin only two weeks\r\nbefore, on returning to America from his leave of absence.\r\n\r\nKnowing how anxious President Wilson was to use any proper opportunity\r\nthat might present itself for ending the war, I asked Bernstorff whether\r\nhis Government would entertain a proposition for mediation.\r\n\r\nHe answered me promptly: \"Speaking for myself, I certainly would\r\nentertain such a proposition.\" But he added that he could not speak\r\nofficially, since cable communication with his Government had been cut\r\noff for a week or more.\r\n\r\nI asked him whether in his opinion his Government would give favorable\r\nconsideration to such a proposal. He said that before leaving Berlin he\r\nhad discussed with the Chancellor the possibility of mediation,\r\nfollowing the report of President Wilson's statement that he was ready\r\nto offer his services as mediator to both parties, and the Chancellor\r\nhad said that the war had but begun and it was too early to instruct\r\nregarding mediation until the offer was presented. On my questioning him\r\nfurther, the ambassador said his personal opinion was that his\r\nGovernment would accept an offer of mediation. I remarked that I could\r\nnot but regard his statement as significant, and asked him if I might\r\nuse it in such a manner as I saw fit. He replied that he had no\r\nobjection.\r\n\r\nAs we rose from the table, I made sure of my understanding of his\r\nstatements, and then the thought occurred to me that the best thing to\r\ndo was to report the conversation to Secretary of State Bryan, so that\r\nhe might, if he saw fit, bring it before the President. I so informed\r\nBernstorff, and again he told me he had no objection.\r\n\r\nI looked at my watch. It was ten-fifteen. I announced that I would go to\r\nWashington on the midnight train. My host suggested that I \"sleep on it\r\nand don't hurry\"; but I concluded that if there was anything I could do\r\nto shorten the war by even a few hours I would have to charge myself\r\nwith neglect of duty if on account of personal convenience I had\r\nrefrained from doing so. The next day was Sunday; the day after was\r\nLabor Day; and all the while thousands were falling on the battlefield.\r\nSeveral of the guests agreed with my decision, so I bade them\r\ngood-night, called my motor, and caught the midnight train for\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nSunday morning I telephoned to Mr. Bryan at once and made an appointment\r\nto meet him at his home. I repeated my conversation with Bernstorff\r\nprecisely as it had occurred, and Bryan believed, as I did, that it\r\nmight pave the way to mediation. I suggested that he have the German\r\nambassador come to Washington and speak with him. He communicated with\r\nthe German embassy, and Bernstorff arrived the following morning.\r\n\r\nBryan presented the subject to the President, who expressed himself as\r\npleased with the possibility of a favorable outcome. The Secretary\r\nadvised me to have a conference with the British ambassador, Sir Cecil\r\nSpring-Rice, and with the French ambassador, M. Jusserand. He had\r\nalready informed them what had taken place and of my presence in\r\nWashington. Sir Cecil asked whether I would kindly come to the embassy,\r\nand I replied I would do so, and suggested that he arrange to have the\r\nFrench ambassador also present. This he did.\r\n\r\nWhen I reached the embassy, M. Jusserand had not yet arrived, and Sir\r\nCecil and I indulged in reminiscences. He too had been in Constantinople\r\nduring my first mission, as secretary of the British embassy. Soon we\r\nwere joined by M. Jusserand, whom also I had known well for many years,\r\nfor he had been in Washington since 1902, and I had seen much of him\r\nduring my Cabinet days.\r\n\r\nWhen we took up the proposal regarding which we had come together, both\r\nof these gentlemen agreed that it was deserving of serious attention,\r\nbut Sir Cecil had little confidence in Bernstorff, who had been his\r\ncolleague at Cairo, where they had represented their respective\r\nGovernments. He asked whether I thought an ambassador would make such a\r\nstatement as Bernstorff's without authority from his Government. I\r\nreplied that both he and M. Jusserand were better qualified to answer\r\nthat question, upon which M. Jusserand said that he knew that no\r\nambassador under the German system would dare make such remarks without\r\nprevious authority from his Government.\r\n\r\n\"That is so much the better,\" I commented.\r\n\r\nSir Cecil declared that German diplomacy was peculiar and that the\r\nForeign Office had no conscience in disavowing statements by its\r\nambassadors if it suited Germany's purpose.\r\n\r\nAfter we had gone over the whole subject, both ambassadors stated that\r\nif it held one chance in a hundred of shortening the war, it was their\r\nduty to entertain it. I replied that I hoped they would entertain it\r\ncordially.\r\n\r\nJusserand in his usual happy manner said, \"'Cordially,' that is a little\r\ntoo strong.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sympathetically, then,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sympathetically, yes.\" And with that we parted, both ambassadors\r\nexpressing their thanks and appreciation of my services.\r\n\r\nI had been scrupulously careful to be absolutely accurate in all my\r\nstatements, and it was therefore gratifying, after the Bryan-Bernstorff\r\nconference, to have the Secretary tell me that the ambassador's report\r\nof the Scarboro incident was in every detail in accord with mine, and to\r\nhave the ambassador also confirm the correctness of Mr. Bryan's\r\nunderstanding from my report. Naturally I was anxious to avoid\r\nmisunderstandings or misconceptions of any kind. The issue was too\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\nBoth Secretary Bryan and Ambassador Bernstorff cabled to Berlin, and for\r\nthe time the subject rested there. My remaining in Washington was\r\nunnecessary, and I returned to New York. But before leaving, I called by\r\nappointment at both the French and British embassies, which also had\r\ncommunicated events in detail to their Governments. Both ambassadors\r\nexpressed their high appreciation for my services and hoped I would keep\r\nin close touch with them regarding the matter, both for their sake and\r\nfor the sake of our respective Governments. I told them I would regard\r\nmyself as \"messenger boy\" for mediation. Sir Cecil replied, \"Ambassador\r\nextraordinary.\" He promised to keep me informed, and two days later\r\nwrote me:\r\n\r\n     I have not yet received any intimation from my Government, nor do I\r\n     expect one unless something definite is before them. But I need not\r\n     tell you how heartily my sympathy is with your humanitarian\r\n     efforts, and you know Grey well enough to be sure that, while\r\n     scrupulously faithful to all his engagements, he will do everything\r\n     possible in the cause of peace.\r\n\r\nThroughout these negotiations we took great care to keep the matter\r\nsecret. Despite that fact it leaked out in some way, and the\r\ncorrespondent of the London \"Times\" reported it in such a way as to give\r\nthe impression that I had been duped by the wily German ambassador; and\r\nthere were one or two other papers which took that view. Sir Cecil\r\nSpring-Rice was incensed at this interpretation and wrote me on October\r\n3d:\r\n\r\n     I am sure no one who knows you and knows the facts would ever think\r\n     that you were either duped or the secret agent of Germany. I am\r\n     quite positive that Sir Edward Grey would never have such an idea.\r\n     What you did--and what I hope you will continue to do--is a work of\r\n     pure philanthropy.\r\n\r\nOn October 15th he wrote me again on this subject, saying that when the\r\nLondon \"Times\" representative returned to Washington from New York, he\r\nwould set him right as to the facts with a view to having the report\r\ncorrected, and adding:\r\n\r\n     We used to say at school, \"Blessed are the peace makers, for they\r\n     get more kicks than half-pence!\" It represents a melancholy truth,\r\n     but, however, I am sure every well-thinking person must appreciate\r\n     your beneficent efforts.\r\n\r\nBut in general the press of Great Britain expressed its appreciation of\r\nthe services I had rendered in lifting the latch of the door to\r\nmediation.\r\n\r\nA letter from Sir Edward Grey concerning the negotiations sheds\r\nimportant light upon the British attitude:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        FOREIGN OFFICE, LONDON, S.W.\r\n                                       _Saturday, 26 September, 1914_\r\n\r\n     DEAR MR. STRAUS:\r\n\r\n     Thank you for your letter of the 9th. I am so busy that I have not\r\n     time to write at any length; but do not let that make you suppose\r\n     that I am out of sympathy with what you say.\r\n\r\n     First of all, however, we must save ourselves and the West of\r\n     Europe, before we can exercise any influence elsewhere. The\r\n     Prussian military caste has dominated Germany, and the whole of the\r\n     West of Europe is in danger of being dominated by it. The German\r\n     Government, in the hands of this military caste, prepared this war,\r\n     planned it, and chose the time for it. We know now that the war has\r\n     revealed how thoroughly the German preparations had been made\r\n     beforehand: with an organization and forethought which is\r\n     wonderful, and would have been admirable had it been devoted to a\r\n     praiseworthy purpose. Not one of the other nations now fighting\r\n     against Germany is prepared in the same way.\r\n\r\n     Now, we wish to have three things: Firstly, to secure our own\r\n     liberty as independent States, who will live and let live on equal\r\n     terms; secondly, the establishment somehow of a Germany not\r\n     dominated by a military caste; a nation who will look at liberty\r\n     and politics from the same point of view as we do, and who will\r\n     deal with us on equal terms and in good faith; thirdly, reparation\r\n     for the cruel wrongs done to Belgium; to get that is a matter of\r\n     honour and justice and right.\r\n\r\n     The statements made by Wolff's Bureau in Europe deny that Germany\r\n     is yet ready for peace. If she is ready for peace, then I think\r\n     that her ambassador in Washington ought not to beat about the\r\n     bush. He ought to make it clear to President Wilson that he is\r\n     authorized to speak on behalf of his Government; and state to the\r\n     President that Germany does wish to make peace. In that case,\r\n     President Wilson could approach all the others who are engaged in\r\n     this war and bring them into consultation with one another and with\r\n     him. But at present we have no indication that Germany wishes to\r\n     have peace, and no indication that she would agree to any terms\r\n     that would give reparation to Belgium and security to the rest of\r\n     Europe that the peace would be durable.\r\n\r\n                                 Yours very truly\r\n                                                       E. GREY\r\n\r\nThe history of those negotiations is presented somewhat at length\r\nbecause my friend of many years, the late Ambassador Page, in his\r\nrecently published letters also expressed the feeling that I had been\r\nused as a dupe to throw the blame for continuing the war upon Great\r\nBritain, though he expressed great confidence in me and friendship for\r\nme. I may say I was not unmindful of this contingency; but I felt that\r\nif the negotiations did not result as we hoped, they would serve to\r\nexpose the insincerity of the German Government with regard to its peace\r\nprofessions. And this is precisely what happened, as the answer of the\r\nGerman Chancellor, received by the State Department on September 22d,\r\nconfirms:\r\n\r\n     The Imperial Chancellor is much obliged for America's offer.\r\n     Germany did not want war, it was forced upon her. Even after we\r\n     shall have defeated France we shall still have to face England and\r\n     Russia. England, France, and Russia have signed a convention to\r\n     make peace solely in mutual agreement with each other. England,\r\n     that is, Mr. Asquith, the London Times, and English diplomatic\r\n     officers, have on various occasions ... [sic] that England is\r\n     determined to conduct the war to the utmost and that she expects\r\n     success from it lasting a long time. It is therefore up to the\r\n     United States to get our enemies to make peace proposals. Germany\r\n     can only accept the peace which promises to be a real and lasting\r\n     peace and will protect her against any new attacks from her\r\n     enemies. If we accepted America's offer of mediation now our\r\n     enemies would interpret it as a sign of weakness and the German\r\n     people would not understand it. For the nation which has been\r\n     willing to make such sacrifices has a right to demand that there\r\n     shall be guarantees of rest and security.\r\n\r\nSecretary Bryan, in his instruction to Ambassador Page on September 8th,\r\nhad anticipated Germany's refusal to accept mediation. The instruction\r\nconcluded:\r\n\r\n     We do not know, of course, what reply the German Emperor will make,\r\n     but this war is so horrible from every aspect that no one can\r\n     afford to take the responsibility for continuing it implacably. The\r\n     British and French ambassadors fear that Germany will not accept\r\n     any reasonable terms, but even a failure to agree will not rob an\r\n     attempt at mediation of all its advantages because the different\r\n     nations would be able to explain to the world their attitude, the\r\n     reasons for continuing the war, the end to be hoped for and the\r\n     terms upon which peace is possible. This would locate the\r\n     responsibility for the continuance of the war and help to mould\r\n     public opinion. Will notify you as soon as answer is received from\r\n     Bernstorff.\r\n\r\nOn September 29th all the British papers served by the Central News War\r\nService carried a cable from New York detailing the negotiations, which\r\nended:\r\n\r\n     It is believed by those concerned that an important step has been\r\n     taken to pave the way for mediation, when the opportune moment\r\n     arrives. In other words, the bolt on the door of mediation has been\r\n     thrown back so that it will be possible for the door to be opened\r\n     without either side being forced to take the initiative. Time will\r\n     doubtless show that the initiative so fortuitously taken by Mr.\r\n     Straus will prove of real service in the interests of ultimate\r\n     peace negotiations, and any endeavors to deprecate those services\r\n     as having been made in Germany's interests are not only contrary to\r\n     all the facts, but are most unfortunate.\r\n\r\n     _Note_: The censor does not object to the publication of the\r\n     foregoing details, but insists that publication should be\r\n     accompanied by a footnote pointing out that since these\r\n     occurrences took place the German Government have disavowed their\r\n     ambassador.\r\n\r\nHad Germany's oft-reiterated peace professions been sincere, she would\r\nhave accepted this offer for mediation. By her refusal the falsity of\r\nher professions was exposed not only in Great Britain and in our own\r\ncountry, but in all the neutral countries; and the _expose_ served as\r\nadded proof to all peace-loving and neutrally-minded persons that the\r\nresponsibility for the war and its continuance rested upon the German\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nIn America many of us continued to hope that some way might be found to\r\nbring the representatives of the warring nations into a conference,\r\nthereby removing misunderstanding and misconception and paving the way\r\nfor an early peace. On December 31st the New York representative of the\r\nCentral News of London asked several Americans to write New Year's\r\nmessages to the warring nations of Europe, to be cabled to all the chief\r\nnewspapers of the continent. Messages were given by Dr. Nicholas Murray\r\nButler, Andrew Carnegie, Bishop David Greer, and myself, and they were\r\nall substantially of the same tenor, as a passage from each will show:\r\n\r\n     _Bishop Greer_: It is the earnest hope and prayer of all Christian\r\n     people in America that the awful and deplorable war now raging may\r\n     soon reach an end which will insure lasting peace and one\r\n     satisfactory in character to all the nations involved.\r\n\r\n     _Andrew Carnegie_: I am convinced that the next effort of lovers of\r\n     peace should be to concentrate the world over in demanding that\r\n     this unparalleled slaughter of man by man shall be the last war\r\n     waged by civilized nations for the settlement of international\r\n     disputes. War dethroned--Peace enthroned.\r\n\r\n     _President Butler_: May it be in America's fortunate lot to bind up\r\n     the wounds of the war and to set the feet of her sister nations\r\n     once more in the paths of peace, international good-will and\r\n     constructive statesmanship.\r\n\r\n     I said: For the past five months each of the nations has been\r\n     seeking victory in the trenches of death; but it has not been found\r\n     there. Only through wise counsels can the victory of permanent\r\n     peace be obtained. President Wilson and His Holiness the Pope have\r\n     offered their offices to open the door of mediation. Will not the\r\n     Kaiser and King George give the mandate so that the door may be\r\n     opened and this delusion be dispelled, thereby earning the\r\n     blessings of a bleeding and suffering world?\r\n\r\nThese statements are cited as evidence of how slowly we in America came\r\nto realize the ruthless designs for conquest which the German\r\nmilitarists had prepared and fostered for forty years, not only\r\nstrategically, but even in shaping the psychology of the child in school\r\nand the man in the street to conform to their design.\r\n\r\nFor a year or more events marched on, tragically, like a malignant\r\ndisease. On February 2, 1917, I lunched with Roosevelt at the Hotel\r\nLangdon, on Fifth Avenue and Fifty-Sixth Street, where Roosevelt was in\r\nthe habit of stopping when in New York. The German Government two days\r\nbefore had announced her submarine blockade of the British, French, and\r\nDutch coasts, and our own entrance into the war seemed likely.\r\n\r\nWe were discussing the crisis, and Roosevelt said he did not think we\r\nshould be involved; the President would probably find some way out and\r\narrange to have Germany's pledge, not to destroy merchant ships of\r\nneutrals or belligerents without warning, whittled down so as to apply\r\nonly to ships flying the American flag. He told us that he had engaged\r\npassage on one of the United Fruit Company steamers to Jamaica for Mrs.\r\nRoosevelt and himself. Mrs. Roosevelt needed a change, and they would\r\nstart in a few days. Regarding the war, he could do nothing more. He\r\nhad done all he could. He had made an offer to the Secretary of War to\r\nraise a division, and had a whole card catalogue of names of men who had\r\nvolunteered to serve in it.\r\n\r\nHis relations with the President were far from friendly. He had\r\nviolently criticized him in articles contributed to the \"Metropolitan\r\nMagazine\" and in several public addresses had urged preparedness and\r\ncompulsory military training. I asked him, in view of the German\r\nblockade, what he would do if he were President. He said he would\r\npromptly assemble our fleet, put marines on the interned German ships,\r\nand show Germany that we were in dead earnest; that unless she recalled\r\nher decision to sink merchant ships without observing the rules of\r\nmodern warfare we should take immediate steps to protect our rights.\r\n\r\n\"If we continue to back down we will become Chinafied, without any\r\nrights that other nations will respect,\" said Roosevelt emphatically.\r\n\r\nIn such critical times, personal differences might be laid aside, I\r\nsuggested, and I wanted him to write the President and let him have the\r\nbenefit of his views. I went further: I suggested that I could write the\r\nPresident about it. But in Roosevelt's opinion, Wilson would conclude\r\nthat Roosevelt had himself urged me to do this because of my close\r\nassociation with Roosevelt.\r\n\r\nMy own relations with the President were always agreeable, I might even\r\nsay most friendly. He had written me sometime before, that he would\r\nconsider it a favor if I would keep him informed of developments that\r\ncame under my observation regarding important matters. It occurred to me\r\nthat on the eve of war it would be a fine thing if he consulted with his\r\ntwo surviving predecessors, as Monroe had done in consulting with\r\nJefferson and Madison before issuing the doctrine which bears his name.\r\nIn the crisis we were facing such a step would allay partisan\r\ndifferences and serve to solidify the Nation. With these ideas in mind I\r\nsent the President the following telegram:\r\n\r\n     Every patriotic American should support you in this great crisis in\r\n     the history of our country. May I suggest the course followed by\r\n     Monroe under a crisis involving many of the same principles, to\r\n     confer with the two surviving ex-Presidents, whose advice, I feel\r\n     sure, will be most helpful and serve to patriotically solidify the\r\n     country behind you?\r\n\r\nI informed Roosevelt of my action. He felt sure the President wanted\r\nneither advice nor cooperation, though he himself was ready to give him\r\nthe fullest cooperation should Wilson desire it. He thought the same was\r\ntrue on the part of Mr. Taft. The telegram, to my surprise, was given\r\nout at Washington to the press a day or two later, but nothing ever came\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nOn February 7th the country was more or less agreeably surprised by the\r\nfact that Count von Bernstorff had been given his passports and\r\nAmbassador Gerard at Berlin had been instructed to demand his. I say the\r\ncountry was surprised because the President had so long delayed and\r\navoided such a step--even after the sinking of the Lusitania and the\r\nSussex following his \"strict accountability\" and other strong\r\nstatements--that it was generally believed he did not mean to take it.\r\n\r\nRoosevelt, of course, thought that we should have taken such action long\r\nbefore. His contention was always that had we taken prompt and decisive\r\nsteps after the Lusitania tragedy, we should have been spared the\r\nsubmarine invasions. In fact, he thought we should have acted when\r\nGermany announced her submarine blockade and possibly saved ourselves\r\nfrom the Lusitania horror. Now that diplomatic relations were broken\r\noff, he canceled his trip to Jamaica, not wishing to be out of the\r\ncountry when war was likely to be declared at any moment.\r\n\r\nAt about this time the impression was current that the Jews of America\r\nwere anti-Ally, a fact that had a prejudicial effect in France and\r\nEngland. It probably grew out of the fact that three of the largest\r\nJewish banking houses of the country were of German origin, and further\r\nthat the Yiddish press was anti-Russian in its sympathies as a result of\r\nthe treatment of Jews in Russia.\r\n\r\nAfter a careful investigation of these reports, a group of us met at the\r\nhome of Eugene Meyer, Jr., later chairman of the War Finance\r\nCorporation. Among those I recall at this meeting were: Fabian Franklin,\r\nof the \"New York Evening Post\"; George L. Beer, the historian; Rabbi\r\nStephen S. Wise; Professor Richard Gottheil, of Columbia University. M.\r\nStephane Lauzanne, editor of \"Le Matin\" of Paris, and Professor Henri\r\nBergson, both of whom were then in New York, had also been consulted. It\r\nwas decided that the most practical way of correcting this erroneous\r\nimpression was for me to write to the French and British ambassadors at\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nAccordingly I wrote to Ambassadors Spring-Rice and Jusserand that the\r\nimpression was unfounded, that our investigations and observations\r\nshowed a large preponderance of pro-Ally sympathy among the Jews, and I\r\ncited a number of leading citizens in business and the various\r\nprofessions, who were representative of their class, whom I knew\r\npersonally to be pro-Ally. I stated further that in one of the largest\r\nJewish clubs, whose membership consisted almost entirely of Jews of\r\nGerman origin, the pro-Ally sentiment was so strong as to be practically\r\nunanimous.\r\n\r\nThe ambassadors were grateful for this information, which they\r\ncommunicated to their Governments; and through the agency of M. Lauzanne\r\nand with the consent of the ambassadors, the letters were given in full\r\nto the French and British press.\r\n\r\nOn the very day that Congress declared war against Germany, April 6,\r\n1917, we were giving a dinner at our home to Professor Henri Bergson.\r\nAmong our guests were James M. Beck, author of \"The Evidence in the\r\nCase\" and \"The War and Humanity\"; ex-Senator Burton of Ohio; former\r\nGovernor and Mrs. John M. Slaton, of Georgia; Adolph S. Ochs, of the\r\n\"New York Times,\" and Mrs. Ochs. Bergson was regarded as the unofficial\r\nrepresentative of France in our country at the time. Of course, our\r\nthoughts and conversation were dominated by the great event of the day.\r\nProfessor Bergson and Mr. Beck drank and responded to toasts with\r\neloquent fervor. It was felt by all that the entrance into the war of\r\nthe United States would prove a decided factor in winning it for\r\ndemocracy and constitutional liberty.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJust before Christmas, 1918--to be specific, on December 22d--I called\r\non Roosevelt at the Roosevelt Hospital, where he was convalescing from\r\nhis seven weeks' illness, believed to have been inflammatory rheumatism.\r\nHe was dressed in his _robe de chambre_ and was seated in an armchair\r\nwith a pile of books before him. He looked neither enfeebled nor\r\nemaciated, though he showed signs of illness. When I asked him how he\r\nhad been since my last visit, for I had called on him frequently during\r\nhis illness, he told me that he had had an attack of embolism--I think\r\nthat was the ailment--which showed in his wrists, and that his fever had\r\ngone up to 104. But that was all gone and he was again feeling fine. He\r\nwas planning to return to Sagamore Hill to spend Christmas, which he\r\nsubsequently did.\r\n\r\nHe inquired particularly about my son Roger, of whom he was very fond,\r\nand who was then in Siberia, where he had served for some months as\r\ncaptain and assistant intelligence officer on the staff of General\r\nWilliam S. Graves, in command of the American Expeditionary Forces. I\r\ntold him we had had a cable from Roger from Blagoveschensk that he was\r\nwell. In his last letter he had expressed a desire to come home, since\r\nthe war was over. Roosevelt agreed that that was right. He would not\r\nwant his own sons to endanger their lives in the civil war raging in\r\nRussia, and he would not have Roger do so. \"Let the Russians settle\r\ntheir own internal affairs; that is not our business,\" he added.\r\n\r\nBy way of amusing and interesting Roosevelt, I told him of a curious\r\nincident narrated in one of Roger's letters. He had been sent as the\r\nofficial representative of the army into the Amur Province, of which the\r\ngovernor was Alexandre Alexiefsky, who had been a member of the\r\nConstitutional Assembly of the Kerensky Government. When Roger called,\r\nthe governor repeated his name familiarly and then asked: \"Are you\r\nrelated to His Excellency by that name in the Cabinet of President\r\nRoosevelt?\" When Roger told him he was my son, the governor immediately\r\nexpressed a readiness to help him in every possible way, because as the\r\nlatter said he owed his life to me. As Roger expressed it, \"He was\r\ncourteous before, but after that he was ready to give me his\r\nundershirt.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROGER W. STRAUS\r\n\r\nFirst Lieutenant, afterwards Captain, on the Staff of General W. S.\r\nGraves, American Expeditionary Force in Siberia. Now Major in the\r\nReserve Corps, U. S. A.]\r\n\r\nAlexiefsky had told Roger the story of his case. In the autumn of 1908,\r\nseveral Russians whom the Czar had exiled to Siberia as political\r\nprisoners made their escape and came to the United States. The Russian\r\nGovernment discovered this and engaged one of the leading New  York law\r\nfirms to secure the extradition of the refugees, which was demanded on\r\nthe specious charge of murder. Secretary Root, in the midst of his many\r\nimportant duties, favored the extradition, and the papers were referred\r\nby the State Department to Attorney-General Bonaparte. Application for\r\ndeportation was also made to me under the immigration laws.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile several prominent men and women interested in the case--Miss\r\nLillian Wald, of the Henry Street Settlement House, New York, and James\r\nBronson Reynolds, chairman of the American Society for Russian Freedom,\r\nforemost among these--supplied the intelligence and the proof that these\r\nmen were not criminals in any sense, but political refugees. When\r\nRoosevelt spoke to me about them, I told him that I had declined to\r\ndeport them because it was clear to me that they were political\r\nrefugees. At that moment Bonaparte joined us. Roosevelt requested him to\r\nreturn the papers in the case, and shortly directed that the men were\r\nnot to be deported.\r\n\r\nRoosevelt said he vividly recalled all this. His face beamed as he said:\r\n\"Is n't that fine! Very fine! I'm delighted to hear it!\"\r\n\r\n\"You did that,\" I said to him; \"without your sustaining me these men\r\nwould have been either extradited or deported, which would have meant\r\ndeath.\"\r\n\r\n\"Both of us did it; it's fine! I'm delighted to hear it,\" he commented,\r\nhis face glowing with its usual vivacity.\r\n\r\nThe next day Roosevelt left the hospital to return to his home in Oyster\r\nBay. He apparently gave every indication that soon he would be entirely\r\nwell again and be with us for many years. Certainly that is what we all\r\nexpected. He was only sixty.\r\n\r\nExactly two weeks later, on January 6, 1919, I received a telephone call\r\nat seven o'clock in the morning from Miss Striker, secretary to Mr.\r\nRoosevelt, announcing that he had died early that morning. For thirteen\r\nyears or more he had had a large and affectionate share in our lives and\r\nthoughts, and Mrs. Straus and I felt as though we had been stricken with\r\nthe loss of a member of our immediate family. I can truly say that I\r\nnever had a more loyal or a dearer friend. He always treated me and mine\r\nas if we were among his nearest relatives.\r\n\r\nOn January 8th my wife, my son's wife, and I motored to Oyster Bay to\r\nattend the funeral in the little Episcopal Church. It had been\r\nRoosevelt's wish that he be buried from the little church that was the\r\nplace of worship of his family. The building held only about three\r\nhundred and fifty persons, so that none but his family and close friends\r\ncould be present. There was a committee from the United States Senate\r\nheaded by Vice-President Marshall; a committee from the House; several\r\nformer members of the Cabinet--Elihu Root, Truman H. Newberry, Henry L.\r\nStimson, James R. Garfield, Mrs. Garfield, ex-President Taft, Governor\r\nHughes. William Loeb, Jr., and Captain Archie Roosevelt were ushers. The\r\nother sons, Theodore and Kermit, were still in France. The church was\r\nfilled with a company of sincere friends and bereaved mourners. The\r\nregular Episcopal service was begun at twelve-forty-five, and lasted\r\nabout twenty-five minutes, when we all accompanied the body to the\r\nlittle cemetery on the side of the hill half a mile away.\r\n\r\nHardly a day passes without its scores of pilgrims to that grave. They\r\ncome from near and far. Many lay flowers on the grave. On holidays and\r\nSundays they come by the hundreds. Two years ago the intimate friends of\r\nRoosevelt, who had been officially or personally associated with him,\r\nformed the Roosevelt Pilgrimage, an association whose purpose is to keep\r\nalive the ideals and personality of Theodore Roosevelt by an annual\r\nvisit to his grave and a simple ceremony. The idea and organization\r\noriginated with Mr. E. A. Van Valkenburg of the Philadelphia \"North\r\nAmerican.\" On January 6, 1922, some sixty persons made the pilgrimage,\r\nheaded by Dr. Lyman Abbott, permanent chairman of the association. James\r\nR. Garfield read Roosevelt's Nobel Peace Prize address, delivered in\r\nChristiania in 1910, at the conclusion of which some wreaths were laid\r\non the grave. Mrs. Roosevelt invited us all to luncheon, and the\r\nold-time hospitality and friendliness of the Roosevelt home brought many\r\nmemories of our departed leader.\r\n\r\nAfter luncheon the annual meeting of the Pilgrimage took place in the\r\ngreat North Room, where Roosevelt had so often received his friends and\r\nguests. Dr. Abbott made a brief and feeling address, and Mrs. Richard\r\nDerby (Ethel Roosevelt) read from original manuscript Roosevelt's\r\nproclamation of 1912 which called into being the Progressive Party.\r\nHermann Hagedorn read a poem entitled \"The Deacon's Prayer,\" by Samuel\r\nValentine Cole, which had especially appealed to Roosevelt. The last\r\nstanza of this poem is as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"We want a man whom we can trust\r\n    To lead us where thy purpose leads;\r\n  Who dares not lie, but dares be just--\r\n    Give us the dangerous man of deeds!\"\r\n  So prayed the deacon, letting fall\r\n    Each sentence from his heart; and when\r\n  He took his seat the brethren all,\r\n    As by one impulse, cried, \"Amen!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nPARIS PEACE CONFERENCE\r\n\r\n     The League to Enforce Peace goes into action--Taft recalls that\r\n     Roosevelt favored a League of Nations--I sail for Europe as\r\n     chairman of the overseas committee--England's youthful Lord\r\n     Chancellor--Bryce at the age of eighty-two--On to\r\n     Paris--Conferences with Colonel House--House declares that the\r\n     League of Nations is \"on the rocks\"--Bourgeois comes to our\r\n     apartment--He is persuaded to accept and support the Covenant as\r\n     provisionally presented--Wilson congratulates me--The President\r\n     addresses the correspondents--At the Plenary Session--An imposing\r\n     spectacle--Clemenceau brusquely opens the session--President Wilson\r\n     speaks for 1,200,000,000 people--Significance of the term\r\n     \"Covenant\"--Bourgeois accepts text as drafted, but offers\r\n     amendments for political effect--Japan voices her ancient\r\n     grievance--The golden chapter in the history of\r\n     civilization--Impressions of General Smuts--Sir Robert Borden opens\r\n     fire on Article X--At a Washington's Birthday luncheon with General\r\n     Pershing--The General's nervousness at prospect of having to make a\r\n     speech--Sazonoff tells me about the Czar--A luncheon to Ambassador\r\n     Sharp and myself--Concerning the side-tracking of Secretary\r\n     Lansing--Taft's efforts at home on behalf of a League of\r\n     Nations--Conferences with Venizelos--Serbia's claims--Meeting in\r\n     London of allied societies for a League of Nations--Religious\r\n     liberty resolution offered and adopted--I confer with President\r\n     Wilson in Paris--A luncheon with Russian refugee\r\n     statesmen--Excitement regarding the Monroe Doctrine article--My\r\n     address at the Sorbonne--The Covenant of the League of\r\n     Nations--Colonel House urges me to return to America--Alexander\r\n     Kerensky--United States Senate vigorously debates the Covenant--Our\r\n     efforts to secure its adoption--World policies are subordinated to\r\n     home politics--Conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow that the curtain of armistice had descended upon the world's most\r\ndevastating war, the League to Enforce Peace was endeavoring to\r\ncooperate in every possible way with President Wilson and the official\r\ndelegates to the Peace Conference, and with similar organizations in\r\nEurope, to bring into existence a League of Nations.\r\n\r\nI had been made chairman of the overseas committee, and on the afternoon\r\nof Theodore Roosevelt's funeral, former President Taft and I met to\r\nconfer regarding the work to be done. Both of us were very much\r\ndepressed by the death of our friend. Taft felt grateful that\r\n\"Theodore\" (as he always called Roosevelt) and he had some months\r\nearlier reestablished their long-time former friendship, which had\r\nunhappily been interrupted by political events.\r\n\r\nMr. Taft courteously told me that he was glad that I was going to Paris,\r\nand that he believed I might render a great service in helping to secure\r\nan effective League of Nations. He hoped I would have conferences with\r\nBalfour, Lloyd George, and Leon Bourgeois, and that I would be able to\r\nshow them what kind of a League we, and as we thought, the American\r\npublic generally, wanted. At my request, Taft agreed to write me a\r\nletter, signed by himself as president of the League to Enforce Peace,\r\nand by A. Lawrence Lowell, chairman of the Executive Committee, giving\r\nme full authority to take whatever action in Europe I might consider\r\nwise. I told Taft that I wanted a letter which should expressly state,\r\namong other things, that I was to support our official delegates, as it\r\nwould not do for America to show a divided front. He told me, what I\r\nalso had known from conversations with Roosevelt, that Roosevelt had\r\nlatterly expressed himself in favor of such a League of Nations as we\r\nstood for. I reminded Taft that Roosevelt had been the first in recent\r\nyears to emphasize the subject of a League of Nations, having done so in\r\nhis Nobel Peace Prize address.\r\n\r\nThe committee to represent at Paris the League to Enforce Peace\r\nconsisted of myself as chairman, Hamilton Holt as vice-chairman, and\r\nsuch other members of the League as might be in Paris at that time. Mr.\r\nHolt, after consulting me as to methods and plan of action pending my\r\narrival, had left New York on December 28th. I had postponed my\r\ndeparture for Paris until I could learn of my son Roger's departure from\r\nSiberia.\r\n\r\nOn January 25, 1919, I left New York, reaching London on February 4th,\r\nwhere I promptly conferred with the members of the British League of\r\nNations Union. Sir Willoughby Dickinson, M.P., gave me full details of\r\nthe meetings that had been held by the English, French, and Italian\r\nleagues in Paris, at which our League was represented by Hamilton Holt.\r\nI also had a consultation with Lord Shaw, the chairman of the conference\r\nof delegates, who gave me a copy of the resolutions that had been\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\nWe remained in London several days, and while there dined with our new\r\nambassador, John W. Davis, formerly the Solicitor-General of the United\r\nStates. Both he and Mrs. Davis, in the short time they had been in\r\nLondon, had won the esteem of official England. At this dinner I had a\r\nlong conversation with the new Lord Chancellor, Birkenhead, formerly Sir\r\nFrederick Smith, who held a distinguished position at the British Bar,\r\nand had been Attorney-General in the last Cabinet. In the latter part of\r\n1917 he had visited the United States, where I had met him, and where he\r\nhad made a number of addresses in the leading cities, as well as in\r\nCanada. He was then only forty-seven years of age, but looked much\r\nyounger, and therefore quite unlike the typical Lord Chancellor robed in\r\nvenerable dignity. He told me that he was the youngest Lord Chancellor,\r\nwith one exception, that had ever sat on the woolsack. He had the\r\nyouthful and vivacious face of a man in the thirties. He said that\r\nnothing would please him more than, when he was no longer Lord\r\nChancellor, to practice law in America, but he said that precedent would\r\nnot permit a former Lord Chancellor to return to the bar and practice\r\nhis profession.\r\n\r\nBirkenhead was very outspoken in his opposition to a League of Nations,\r\nsaying that it was a Utopian idea. He asked whether I had seen his book\r\nwhich had recently appeared, describing his visit to America. I told him\r\nI had not, and on the next day he sent me a copy bearing his\r\ninscription.\r\n\r\nThe following day we lunched with Mr. and Mrs. Herbert Samuel. He had\r\nheld several Cabinet positions, and had been Secretary of the Home\r\nOffice in the last Cabinet. He was defeated as candidate for Parliament\r\nin the last election. He told me he had recently returned from Paris\r\nfrom a Zionist Conference where his views and advice were desired. He\r\nstated that he was not a Zionist, but was in full sympathy with the\r\nBalfour Declaration to secure a homeland in Palestine with equal civil\r\nand religious rights for all nationalities. I told him that was\r\nprecisely my position. His son was present, who was about twenty years\r\nof age, and had been in the British army, and was later transferred to\r\nthe Zionist Corps.\r\n\r\nThat evening I dined with Sir Arthur Steele-Maitland, M.P.,\r\nUnder-Secretary of the Foreign Office, where I met my old friend\r\nViscount Bryce, who was then about eighty-two years of age. He was still\r\nin the best of health and his mind was as alert as ever. He brought me a\r\ncopy of his recent brochure, \"Proposals for the Prevention of Future\r\nWars,\" Maitland strongly favored a League of Nations, and told me that\r\nafter I arrived in Paris, if I found it necessary for the committee of\r\nthe League of Nations Union to return there to reenforce the official\r\ndelegates, I should write or wire him, and several of the members would\r\ngo over to cooperate with our committee; and that he would write Lord\r\nRobert Cecil so that we might have a conference. I had similar letters\r\nfrom Lord Shaw and Sir Willoughby Dickinson.\r\n\r\nWe arrived in Paris on February 9th, where our friends, Mr. and Mrs.\r\nEdward Mamelsdorf, had generously placed at our disposal their\r\ncomfortable apartment in the rue Montaigne, which was most conveniently\r\nand centrally situated, and saved us the necessity and difficulty of\r\nsecuring accommodations, all the hotels being jammed full. The following\r\nmorning I met Mr. Holt, who had admirably represented our committee at\r\nthe several conferences that were held prior to my arrival; also Judge\r\nWilliam H. Wadhams, Mrs. Fannie Fern Andrews, Arthur Kuhn, secretary and\r\nlegal adviser of our committee, besides several other members of our\r\nLeague.\r\n\r\nWith Mr. Holt I went to the Crillon Hotel, headquarters of the American\r\nDelegation, and had a conference with Colonel House, with whom\r\narrangements were made for the fullest cooperation between our League\r\nand the Official Commission. We also conferred with Mr. Gordon\r\nAuchincloss, the son-in-law and secretary of Colonel House, who, after\r\nconsulting with the latter, gave me in confidence a typewritten copy of\r\nthe Articles of the League entitled: \"Draft as Provisionally Approved.\"\r\nHe said that the Colonel wanted me to have this, so that I might study\r\nit. I was told at the same time that the outlook for the adoption of a\r\nLeague was very discouraging because the French Delegation, of which\r\nLeon Bourgeois was the head, insisted upon the inclusion of two\r\nadditional clauses, (1) the control by the League of the manufacture of\r\nall armaments and of all war industries, and (2) an international\r\nmilitary force to defend the French frontier, which, Bourgeois insisted,\r\nquoting from a former speech of President Wilson, \"was the frontier of\r\ncivilization.\"\r\n\r\nPresident Wilson had emphatically objected to the proposed additions.\r\n\r\nWhen I informed Colonel House that I was about to call on Leon Bourgeois\r\nat his home across the Seine, he said, \"By all means, go,\" and added\r\nthat Bourgeois's attitude \"had put the League on the rocks.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Holt, Mr. Kuhn, and I proceeded to Bourgeois's house, but when we\r\narrived there late in the afternoon, we were told that M. Bourgeois was\r\nout, that he was then in the Senate and would not return until late.\r\nWhile there, however, I met my friend and colleague on the Hague\r\nTribunal, Baron d'Estournelles de Constant. He said he would see to it\r\nthat we met Bourgeois that evening. Mr. Holt, Mr. Kuhn, and I then\r\nreturned to my apartment, and had hardly arrived there when my telephone\r\nrang and I was informed that M. Bourgeois and Baron d'Estournelles were\r\non their way to my residence. They arrived promptly at seven o'clock.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the discussion, Bourgeois presented the interposing\r\ndifficulties to which I have referred, giving the divergence of views\r\nbetween him and President Wilson and Colonel House. I explained to him,\r\nmore fully than he seemed to have appreciated before, that the\r\nwar-making power was lodged by our Constitution exclusively in Congress,\r\nand that even if the President should agree to the additional articles,\r\nif these articles would in any way conflict with the war-making power as\r\nprovided for in the Constitution, President Wilson's assent would be\r\nwithout effect, and would never be ratified by our Senate.\r\n\r\nAt this point in our conversation, the telephone rang and M. Bourgeois\r\nwas informed that the President of the Ministry, M. Clemenceau, desired\r\nto see him at once. Bourgeois said he would shortly return and hurriedly\r\nleft us. In the meantime we continued the conversation with\r\nd'Estournelles, who, being familiar with our American system, was better\r\nable to appreciate the problem. I told him plainly that Colonel House\r\nhad said to me that afternoon that \"the League of Nations was on the\r\nrocks.\"\r\n\r\nBourgeois returned in half an hour and we resumed the discussion. After\r\nexplaining more at length our constitutional provisions, I told him that\r\nif the proposed League were made too strong it would be useless, so far\r\nas America was concerned, since it would not be ratified by the Senate.\r\nKnowing what a strong advocate he had always been of the League of\r\nNations, as he was and had been for years past the president of the\r\nFrench League of Nations Society, I asked him whether he would prefer\r\nhaving no League rather than a League as drafted, without the two\r\narticles he had proposed.\r\n\r\nHe frankly replied that if that were the alternative, he would prefer to\r\nhave the League as drafted. He then referred to the fact that at our\r\nlast Congressional election, the Administration had been defeated, and\r\ntherefore, as he understood it, the President represented a minority\r\nparty. I told him that, while such would be the case under the European\r\nsystem, it was not so under our system, and then read to him from my\r\nletter of credence \"to support the President,\" explaining that the\r\npresident of our League, Mr. Taft, along with Dr. Lowell, myself, and\r\nmany others, was not of the President's party, yet I was authorized and\r\ninstructed to support the President.\r\n\r\nBourgeois replied that at the Plenary Session of the Conference, which\r\nwas to be held on the Friday following, namely, on the 14th, at the Quai\r\nd'Orsay, in view of the American position which I had made clear to him,\r\nhe would support the \"Draft as Provisionally Approved,\" but that he\r\nwanted me to appreciate that they had politics in France as well as we\r\nhad, and that therefore he would, at any rate, have to present at the\r\nConference the two articles referred to, if for no other reason than for\r\ntheir popular effect; but that I could rely on it that his Government\r\nwould in the final analysis accept the covenant or draft as\r\nprovisionally presented by the representatives of the fourteen nations\r\nwhich had participated in its preparation and had preliminarily agreed\r\nto it.\r\n\r\nWhen Bourgeois and d'Estournelles departed, which was at about ten\r\no'clock, I called up Colonel House, and, after briefly informing him\r\nwhat had taken place, I told him that the League was \"off the rocks.\" He\r\nexpressed his great gratification, and on the following morning when I\r\nmet him he said that he had informed the President, who desired heartily\r\nto congratulate me.\r\n\r\nWhen Colonel House had informed me that \"the League was on the rocks,\"\r\nit was more real than figurative; for at the session of the Commission\r\non the League held the evening before, the French members having\r\ninsisted among other provisions upon an international army to guard the\r\nfrontier, and President Wilson having point-blank refused to agree to\r\nit, an _impasse_ had been reached, since neither side would give way.\r\nThe Commission thereupon adjourned, apparently without any possibility\r\nof coming to an understanding. Considerable bitterness was developed in\r\nthe discussion, as I learned, between the President and M. Bourgeois. It\r\nwas at this stage that I fortuitously arrived at the Crillon to report\r\nthat our committee, by calling on M. Bourgeois, had been able\r\nunofficially to take up and discuss with him the situation, which\r\nofficially had apparently passed beyond the stage of further discussion.\r\nTherefore it was, as Holt and I were subsequently informed, a great\r\nrelief to the President and Colonel House, as well as to Clemenceau and\r\nBourgeois, that we had been able to remove the _impasse_ by inducing the\r\nFrench delegates to agree to support the Covenant as preliminarily\r\ndrafted.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSome months before, there had been organized in Paris a luncheon club,\r\nthe Cercle Interallie, as a comfortable and convenient meeting-place for\r\nmany officials and others. Immediately upon my arrival, I was introduced\r\nat the club, where I frequently took lunch and met many people,\r\nofficials and delegates of the allied nations. The day following our\r\nconversation at my apartment, I met Baron d'Estournelles by appointment\r\nat lunch, and he informed me that Bourgeois had expressed himself\r\ngratified with the clarification I had given him and that I could rely\r\nupon the Covenant being adopted as we had agreed.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 14th, while I was at Colonel House's office, I\r\nreceived a copy of the Covenant which had just been put in print, as\r\nreedited by the Sub-Committee of the League of Nations under the\r\nchairmanship of Lord Robert Cecil. While I was there, President Wilson\r\ncame in to meet the representatives of the American press. When he saw\r\nme, he expressed his high appreciation for our services and helpfulness.\r\nThe President made a brief address to the correspondents, beginning in a\r\nsemi-humorous vein, and then giving a general description of the\r\nCovenant as finally drafted, explaining that where so many nations were\r\ninvolved, no one's individual ideas could be fully satisfied, and that\r\nthere had to be yielding on all sides. Wilson added that he would have\r\nliked to see some definite declaration regarding the protection of\r\nreligious minorities, and referred to several of the other outstanding\r\nprovisions.\r\n\r\nColonel House asked me to see Bourgeois again before the Plenary Session\r\nwhich was to take place that afternoon, saying that he had heard that\r\nBourgeois was going to oppose the Covenant. I immediately called on\r\nBourgeois again, and told him precisely what the Colonel had said, but\r\nBourgeois assured me that there had been no change, and that the\r\nCovenant, or as it was styled in French, _Le Pacte_, would not be\r\nopposed.\r\n\r\nThat same afternoon, I went with former Ambassador Henry White, one of\r\nour official delegates, to the Session of the Plenary Conference at the\r\nQuai d'Orsay which convened at 3.30 o'clock. I accompanied him into the\r\nConference room, a large, vaulted, ornate chamber known as the Clock\r\nRoom, where were seated, at the tables arranged along three sides of a\r\nsquare, with an inner row of seats arranged in the same way, the\r\ndelegates of the thirty nations.\r\n\r\nOn the outside of the square were the tables for the secretaries of the\r\nseveral nations. At the head of the table sat M. Clemenceau; to his\r\nright was President Wilson, and on his left was to be Lloyd George, but\r\nas he was not present, Lord Robert Cecil sat in his place. Next on the\r\nright was Mr. Lansing, and next on the left was Mr. Balfour, and so on\r\nin order. In the rear of the chamber were a number of distinguished\r\npersons and other officials of the Powers. To one side was another large\r\nroom with arched entrances, occupied by the correspondents of the press\r\nof the world. The proceedings began at four o'clock. The ushers closed\r\nthe large entrance doors leading out into the foyer, and all was still\r\nand in expectancy when Clemenceau rose and, in his usual brusque and\r\nunceremonious manner, announced that \"Monsieur Wilson\" would have the\r\n\"parole,\" meaning the floor.\r\n\r\nPresident Wilson arose, calm, dignified, and entirely self-possessed,\r\nand, after a few preliminary words, stated that the representatives of\r\nthe fourteen nations which composed the League of Nations Committee had\r\nunanimously agreed to the Covenant consisting of twenty-six articles to\r\nbe presented to the Conference, representing, according to the estimate,\r\n1,200,000,000 people.\r\n\r\nHe read the articles of the Covenant, one by one, interpolating here and\r\nthere brief explanations. The title \"Covenant\" had been given the\r\ndocument by Wilson, a designation he had previously used in one of his\r\nspeeches. This was regarded as most appropriate, since the pact was not\r\na treaty or convention, but something higher and more sacred, hence the\r\nscriptural designation \"Covenant,\" such as God had made with Israel.\r\n\r\nAfter reading the articles, Wilson made an address of about thirty\r\nminutes. It was clear, forceful, and in his inimitable style. In closing\r\nhe said: \"Armed force is in the background in this programme, but it is\r\nin the background, and if the moral force of the world will not suffice,\r\nthe physical force of the world shall. But that is the last resort,\r\nbecause this is intended as a constitution of peace, not as a League of\r\nWar. Many terrible things have come out of this war, gentlemen, but some\r\nvery beautiful things have come out of it. Wrong has been defeated, but\r\nthe rest of the world has been more conscious than it ever was before,\r\nof the majesty of right.\"\r\n\r\nLord Robert Cecil then spoke briefly, and I will quote a single passage\r\nfrom his address: \"Finally, we have thought that if the world is to be\r\nat peace, it is not enough to forbid war. We must do something more than\r\nthat. We must try and substitute for the principle of international\r\ncompetition that of international cooperation.\"\r\n\r\nSignor Orlando of Italy followed with a brief address, then M. Leon\r\nBourgeois rose and spoke somewhat at length in French. He said that he\r\nproposed amendments which he thought he ought to mention; that while his\r\ncountry had accepted the text which had been read, the amendments were\r\nmentioned so that, as the text went before the world, the amendments\r\nmight also be considered, to the effect that we ought to have a\r\npermanent organization to prepare military and naval means of execution\r\nand make them ready in case of emergency.\r\n\r\nBaron Makino, speaking with persuasive eloquence in perfect English,\r\nmaintained his previous amendments which were as follows: \"The equality\r\nof nations being a basic principle of the League of Nations, the High\r\nContracting Parties agree to accord, as soon as possible, to all aliens,\r\nnationals of States, members of the League, equal and just treatment in\r\nevery respect, making no distinction either in law or in fact on account\r\nof their race or nationality.\" He then added: \"I feel it my duty to\r\ndeclare clearly on this occasion that the Japanese Government and people\r\nfeel poignant regret at the failure of the Commission to approve of\r\ntheir just demand for laying down a principle aiming at the adjustment\r\nof this long-standing grievance, the demand that is based upon a\r\ndeep-rooted natural conviction. They will continue in their insistence\r\nfor the adoption of this principle by the League in the future.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge Barnes, the English labor leader, then spoke, upholding the\r\nargument of Bourgeois for an international force. After him Venizelos\r\nspoke, referring to the amendments of France which had been held back\r\nbecause of constitutional barriers of acquiescence on the part of\r\ncertain countries. He thought those countries should make an effort to\r\nremove those barriers, but that, if they could not do so, then France\r\nshould recede from her position. Mr. Hughes of Australia interposed a\r\nquestion, demanding to know when and where the discussion of mandatories\r\nwould take place, to which Clemenceau replied that the document would\r\nrest on the table and would be discussed at a distant date. Thereupon,\r\nhe abruptly adjourned the session.\r\n\r\nAs the delegates moved out, I met President Wilson, who asked me for my\r\nopinion about the Covenant. I replied that it was much more\r\ncomprehensive and forceful than I had believed it possible for the\r\nnations preliminarily to agree upon. He expressed himself as much\r\ngratified. I believed then, and do yet, that but for Wilson's prestige\r\nand dominant leadership of the Conference, so far at least as the\r\nCovenant was concerned, it would perhaps not have been formulated, if\r\never, until after the Treaty of Peace was concluded. At any rate, I very\r\nmuch doubt if an agreement could have been arrived at.\r\n\r\nAfter my conversation with Wilson, Bourgeois said to me that he hoped I\r\nwas satisfied with his remarks in support of the Covenant, that he had\r\nto refer to the amendments he presented so that they might receive\r\nconsideration. I told him that he had followed the course he had agreed\r\nto when he spoke to me two nights before, that while he would refer to\r\nhis amendments, he would nevertheless support the Covenant.\r\n\r\nWhen I had returned to my apartment, I wrote in my \"Random Notes\": \"I\r\nregard this day and its happenings as the golden chapter in the history\r\nof civilization.\" Notwithstanding what has since happened, I have not\r\nabandoned hope that such may yet prove true.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTwo days before the meeting of the Conference, Hamilton Holt and I had\r\ntea with General Smuts, the distinguished South African delegate. He is\r\na man of very pleasant appearance, rather short in stature, and with his\r\nflorid complexion looks like a veritable Dutchman. He was then\r\napparently about fifty years of age. He would hardly, from his\r\nappearance, be taken for a soldier, but rather for a student. He had\r\ngiven much detailed study to the subject of a League of Nations, and\r\nfrom his brochure \"The League of Nations--A Practical Suggestion\"\r\n(1918) more of his suggestions as there set forth entered into the\r\narticles of the Covenant than those proposed by any other of the\r\ndelegates, including Wilson. Smuts advocated in this brochure that \"the\r\nLeague should be put in the very forefront of the programme of the Peace\r\nConference,\" the same position that Wilson afterward successfully pushed\r\nforward. In the preface of his brochure, dated December 16, 1918, Smuts\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n     To my mind the world is ripe for the greatest step forward ever\r\n     made in the government of man. And I hope this brief account of the\r\n     League will assist the public to realize how great an advance is\r\n     possible to-day as a direct result of the immeasurable sacrifices\r\n     of this war. If that advance is not made, this war will, from the\r\n     most essential point of view, have been fought in vain, and great\r\n     calamities will follow.\r\n\r\nSeveral days after the Conference, on February 17th, my wife and I, Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Holt, and Arthur Kuhn of our committee, attended the French\r\nSenate with Baron d'Estournelles, who is a member thereof. He introduced\r\nus to a number of Senators, with whom we had tea. I had a talk with the\r\nvenerable Alexandre Ribot, head of the group of the Moderate Republican\r\nParty, a refined gentleman of the old school, and of thoroughly\r\nstatesmanlike appearance. We also met Senator Paul Strauss, whom I had\r\nknown when he and his wife visited our country some eighteen years\r\nbefore. He is the editor of the \"Revue Philanthropique,\" and is a member\r\nof the Academy of Medicine. He said that he believed his family and mine\r\nwere connected. This may be so, but I have no definite record.\r\n\r\nDining with Sir Robert Borden, then Premier of Canada and one of the\r\nBritish delegates, the following evening, we met several of his\r\ncolleagues. Balfour was expected, but he had been compelled to return\r\nto London that day. Sir Robert was an important member of the British\r\nDelegation and made some very helpful suggestions. He opposed Article X\r\nof the Covenant which provides that \"the High Contracting Parties\r\nundertake to respect and preserve as against external aggression the\r\nterritorial integrity and existing political independence of all States,\r\nmembers of the League,\" etc., the same article that eventually met with\r\nso much opposition in our Senate, and doubtless was the principal cause\r\nfor the Senate's failure to ratify. At that time it was generally\r\nrumored that Borden would be selected as ambassador to the United States\r\nto succeed Lord Reading. He would doubtless have made a most acceptable\r\nrepresentative in Washington of the British Government, exceptional as\r\nit would have been to have the British Empire represented by a colonial\r\nofficial. No one could have been sent who understood our country and our\r\npeople better.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWashington's Birthday was celebrated by the American Society, which gave\r\na luncheon at the Hotel Quai d'Orsay, which I attended. There were\r\npresent about one hundred and fifty Americans. It was a notable\r\nassembly, and I had the pleasure of sitting next to General Pershing,\r\nwith whom I had a lengthy talk. We spoke, among other things, of the\r\nproposal that our country should take a mandate to govern the Ottoman\r\nEmpire or any part of Europe. Great propaganda had been made that we\r\nshould take a mandate for the Ottoman Empire. Pershing agreed with me\r\nthat this would lead to endless complications and would not be approved\r\nat home. I also talked with Colonel House upon the subject, who was of\r\nthe same opinion. Pershing was evidently quite nervous, for he was\r\nexpected to speak, and he was making some notes. It appeared to me he\r\nwas more disturbed than if he were about to enter into a serious\r\nmilitary engagement.\r\n\r\nI had lunch the next day with Boris Bakhmeteff, the Russian ambassador\r\nto the United States, at which I met Sazonoff, former Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs under the Czar's regime. We naturally spoke about\r\naffairs in Russia and the possibility of reconstruction. I was told that\r\nthe late Czar was kindly and humane, but that he had been completely\r\nmisled and dominated by crafty ministers who were plotting and\r\nintriguing one against another; that Russia was not, by reason of the\r\nignorance of its people, fitted to become a republic, but that it must\r\nhave a government powerfully centralized, and that its best hope would\r\nbe the restoration of the monarchy under Grand Duke Nicholas as\r\nconstitutional ruler. Sazonoff said it was a pity that Petrograd was not\r\ntaken by the Allied fleet. I am told that, under the Czar, Sazonoff was\r\nthe leader of the liberal wing.\r\n\r\nA few days later I gave a little dinner at my apartment to enable Mr.\r\nVance McCormick, chairman of the War Trade Board, to meet several\r\nprominent Russians, including Ambassador Bakhmeteff and Sazonoff. Mr.\r\nHoover was also present. We discussed the rehabilitation of commerce\r\nwith Russia.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of February the Union of Associations for the Society of\r\nNations, together with the European Bureau of the Carnegie Peace\r\nFoundation, gave a luncheon in honor of Ambassador Sharp and myself at\r\nthe Cercle Interallie, at which M. Leon Bourgeois presided. There were\r\npresent some seventy-five guests, mostly delegates and French officials,\r\nincluding Sir Robert Borden; Venizelos, the Greek delegate; the\r\nRoumanian minister; M. Vesnitch, the Serbian minister; and the Brazilian\r\nambassador. At the conclusion, M. Bourgeois arose, and, although there\r\nwere to be no set speeches, he expressed the regret of the French nation\r\nthat Ambassador Sharp would in the near future relinquish his post, and\r\ncomplimented his Administration upon its work of the past four trying\r\nyears. He praised my effective helpfulness in regard to the League of\r\nNations, and stated that he not only greeted me as a twin, because he\r\nwas born in the same year as I was, but also as a Frenchman, since my\r\nfather, who was born in 1809, was a Frenchman by birth, and because my\r\ngreat-grandfather was a delegate to the Conference which was summoned by\r\nNapoleon during the first decade of the past century.\r\n\r\nIn reply, I stated that an American, to be truly patriotic, should\r\nunderstand our early history, and that no American with this knowledge\r\ncould fail to have a love and sense of gratitude for France, our ally in\r\nthe establishment of democracy, as we had so recently been her ally for\r\nthe liberation of the world.\r\n\r\nMy various conferences regarding the League of Nations, while it was\r\nunder discussion and formulation by the Committee of the Conference\r\nhaving charge of that subject, were held with Colonel House and his\r\nsecretary, Mr. Auchincloss. On February 27th, I had lunch with Secretary\r\nLansing. It had been quite obvious to me that even before this he had\r\nbeen practically side-tracked, and that Colonel House had replaced him\r\nfrom the beginning, doubtless by direction of the President. This was\r\nvery evident so far as the League of Nations was concerned. Mr. Lansing\r\ninformed me that he had pointed out a number of technical objections to\r\nthe Covenant as formulated, which, he was sure, would prove a fruitful\r\nsource of difference and would make trouble. It seemed to me that he was\r\nevidently not conversant with the various stages of discussion regarding\r\nthe articles of the Covenant. I referred to the entire omission in the\r\nsecond draft of the section respecting civil and religious liberty and\r\nthe protection of minorities, which was contained in the tentative\r\ndraft, but was finally omitted because Japan had insisted that the\r\nequality of races be included, whereupon the whole subject had been\r\nomitted. I suggested that the entire subject, which was in fact a Bill\r\nof Rights, now that it had been excluded from the Covenant, should be\r\nincorporated in the treaties to be made with each of the new nations.\r\nLansing agreed with me that that should be done and would under the\r\ncircumstances be the best plan.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt this time, during February and March, 1919, the League to Enforce\r\nPeace had organized numerous meetings throughout the country from New\r\nYork to San Francisco, advocating a League of Nations. Mr. Taft had\r\nspoken at many of these meetings for months past, traveling untiringly\r\nand making most effective addresses. At these meetings the Covenant was\r\napproved and resolutions to that effect were passed. On February 25th\r\nand 28th I received cables briefly describing such meetings and the\r\nsubstance of the resolutions passed. I received cables to the same\r\neffect from Salt Lake City, from San Francisco, and from New York. These\r\nI gave to Colonel House, who in turn gave them to the press, and\r\nsometimes they were cabled back through the Associated Press to American\r\nnewspapers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom time to time a number of the representatives of the Balkan and East\r\nEuropean nations came to my apartment to confer with me, doubtless\r\nbecause of my diplomatic experiences in that part of the world, and\r\nbecause of my relationship with Colonel House and our official\r\nCommission. Among others who conferred with me was M. Venizelos, who\r\ncame to discuss the claims of Greece to additional territory to the\r\nnorth, and on the western littoral of Asia Minor, and to the islands\r\nadjacent. He explained, as an ethnological basis for such a claim, that\r\nthe Greek race was purer and less mixed in that part of Asia Minor and\r\nin the islands than in Greece proper. He placed before me several\r\nbrochures containing studies of these points and sent me maps\r\nillustrating those claims, also a document in English entitled: \"Greece\r\nBefore the Peace Congress.\" He told me that, unless his presence was\r\nimperatively demanded in Paris, he would attend with me the London\r\nConference of the Peace Societies of the various nations which was to be\r\nheld there March 11th.\r\n\r\nOn March 7th M. Vesnitch, the chief delegate of Serbia, came to see me\r\nabout Serbia's claims to two towns, Verschatz and Weisskirchen, which\r\nthe sub-committee of ten, under the chairmanship of M. Tardieu, had\r\nawarded to Roumania. He claimed they were predominantly Serbian as to\r\nsympathies and population, and that because they happened to be on the\r\nrailroad running through Roumania was no valid reason for transferring\r\nthem under Roumanian sovereignty. He said Serbia could never consent to\r\nsuch transfer, which would cause not only dissatisfaction, but constant\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe day after the Plenary Session of the Conference and the preliminary\r\nadoption of the Covenant, President Wilson returned to America. I talked\r\nwith M. Bourgeois, M. Vesnitch, M. Venizelos, and several of the\r\nchairmen of the allied societies for a League of Nations, and we agreed\r\nto hold a conference of the delegates of the various societies. Chiefly\r\nbecause of our desire of having with us Sir Edward Grey, who was the\r\nchairman of the British Society, and Lord Bryce, both of whom at that\r\ntime were not entirely well, we decided to hold the conference in London\r\ninstead of in Paris. It was subsequently decided to hold it March\r\n11th-13th for the purpose of discussing the draft of the Covenant as\r\npreliminarily adopted, and to consider such changes and amendments as\r\nmight be deemed advisable, which when acted upon and adopted were to be\r\npresented to our respective official delegates prior to the next meeting\r\nof the Plenary Conference, to be held after President Wilson's return.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on March 11th, the delegates representing America, Great\r\nBritain, France, Greece, China, Jugo-Slavia, and Roumania assembled in\r\nLondon, in all about fifty in number. Besides myself as chairman, there\r\nattended, from America, Hamilton Holt, Arthur Kuhn, Dr. Henry Churchill\r\nKing, Mrs. Fannie Fern Andrews, Raymond V. Ingersoll, Dr. Frederick\r\nLynch, and Edward Harding. Great Britain was represented by Lord Shaw of\r\nDunfermline, Sir W. H. Dickinson, Major David Davies, M.P.; J. H.\r\nThomas, M.P.; J. R. Clynes, M.P.; Sir A. Shirley Benn, M.P.; Sir Arthur\r\nSteele-Maitland, M.P.; Professor Gilbert Murray; Aneurin Williams, M.P.;\r\nH. Wickham Steed, and others. From France came M. Leon Bourgeois,\r\nVice-Admiral Fournier, General Leon Durand, Baron d'Estournelles de\r\nConstant, and others. Greece was represented by M. Venizelos and\r\nProfessor Andreades. China was represented by Mr. Chang and Mr. Cheng;\r\nJugo-Slavia by M. Yovanovitch; and Roumania by Professor E. Pangrati,\r\nProfessor Negulesco, and Miss Helene Vacaresco.\r\n\r\nA preliminary consultation was held on the 10th, with Professor Gilbert\r\nMurray in the chair, and next morning the first meeting of the\r\nconference was held at Caxton Hall, Westminster. Lord Shaw was elected\r\nchairman, and W. J. T. Griffith, secretary. The various articles of the\r\nCovenant were discussed, together with the amendments and changes\r\nproposed by the delegates from the several countries. On behalf of our\r\ndelegation, I offered a resolution regarding the free exercise of\r\nreligion as well as freedom from civil and political discrimination\r\nbecause of religion, which resolution after discussion was unanimously\r\nadopted. Nine separate resolutions were offered by the British\r\ndelegates, some ten resolutions by the French delegates, and others by\r\nthe Roumanian and the Chinese delegates. In all, there were three\r\nsessions, and the resolutions that were adopted M. Bourgeois was\r\nauthorized to present to the allied prime ministers.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 12th, Major David Davies, on behalf of the League\r\nof Nations Union, gave a dinner at the Criterion Restaurant to M.\r\nBourgeois, Dr. Nansen, M. Vandervelde, M. Venizelos, and me. Right Hon.\r\nH. A. L. Fisher, Secretary for Education, was toastmaster. Besides the\r\ndelegates, a number of other prominent men were present. Several\r\nspeeches were made laudatory of the Covenant and expressing high hopes\r\nfor the new world order. Emphasis was laid upon the necessity of\r\nbuilding up a body of opinion throughout the world to support the ideals\r\nof the League and of international peace.\r\n\r\nAfter adjournment, I returned to Paris, and on March 24th made a report\r\nto President Wilson, who, a few days before, had returned from America,\r\nand sent him the resolution proposed by the American delegates, namely,\r\nto add a new article to the Covenant as follows:\r\n\r\n     The High Contracting Parties, realizing that religious\r\n     discriminations give rise to internal dissatisfaction and unrest\r\n     which militate against international concord, agree to secure and\r\n     maintain in their respective countries, as well as in states and\r\n     territories under the tutelage of other states acting as\r\n     mandatories on behalf of the League, the free exercise of religion\r\n     as well as freedom from civil and political discrimination because\r\n     of adherence to any creed, religion or belief not inconsistent with\r\n     public order or with public morals.\r\n\r\nTo this proposal President Wilson replied, saying: \"I am indeed\r\ninterested in a religious liberty article in the Covenant, but am trying\r\nto reach the matter in another way.\" He doubtless had in mind to cover\r\nit in treaties with the new nations for the protection of minorities, as\r\nwas subsequently provided in the treaty with Poland and with the Balkan\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nAt a luncheon on April 6th with the Russian group of refugee statesmen\r\nin Paris, I again met M. Sazonoff; M. de Giers, formerly ambassador at\r\nConstantinople; M. Bark, formerly Minister of Finance under the\r\nGovernment of the late Czar; and M. Boris Bakhmeteff, the Russian\r\nambassador to the United States. They all spoke most disparagingly of\r\nRussian conditions at the time. M. Sazonoff criticized and complained of\r\nthe Peace Conference, which, as he stated, had in no way condemned\r\nRussian Bolshevism, and its failure in so doing had encouraged the\r\nBolsheviki. He said that had the Allies taken Petrograd, which could\r\nhave been done with very little sacrifice, that would have been the\r\nbeginning of the end of Bolshevism and would have rallied the Russian\r\npeople, who would themselves have destroyed the Bolsheviki. He added\r\nthat Russia's cruel treatment of the Jews under the Czar's Government\r\nwas an indefensible wrong, and doubtless contributed to driving some of\r\nthose who had suffered most into the ranks of the Bolsheviki.\r\n\r\nWhile Sazonoff was talking, I wondered why he and some of his\r\ncolleagues in the Ministry had not prevented the outrages against\r\ndefenseless Jews, which resulted in the horrible pogroms which shocked\r\nthe moral sensibility of the world.\r\n\r\nIt is true that Sazonoff belonged to the so-called liberals of Russia,\r\nand they did not have the courage to stand up for the basic principles\r\nof humanity when in office, which they now, doubtless, sincerely\r\nproclaim. Such is the withering and dispiriting effect of autocratic\r\ngovernment upon its own highest officials, who often lack the courage,\r\neven if they have the vision, to correct abuses; and because of this\r\nmoral cowardice they prepare the way and supply the motive that sooner\r\nor later expresses itself in revolution. Napoleon is reputed to have\r\nsaid that the treatment of the Jews in every country is the thermometer\r\nof that country's civilization.\r\n\r\nSeveral times a week, during this period, conferences occurred in my\r\napartment with representatives of the Eastern and Balkan States.\r\nInformation had reached Paris that serious persecution of Jews was\r\nthreatened in Prague and throughout Tchecko-Slovakia; and on March 25th\r\na conference was arranged between M. Edouard Benes, Minister of Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Tchecko-Slovak Republic, and several gentlemen\r\nrepresenting the American Jewish Committee and the American Jewish and\r\nZionist Committee, consisting of Julian W. Mack, Judge of the United\r\nStates Circuit Court; Professor Felix Frankfurter, of Harvard\r\nUniversity; Aaron Aaronson, head of the Agricultural Experiment Station\r\nof Palestine; Lewis L. Strauss, the assistant of Herbert Hoover; and\r\nmyself. Letters from Prague from two of the Food Administration\r\nofficials reported that a press propaganda was carried on against Jews,\r\nand that several attacks upon them had been made; that a movement was on\r\nfoot to deport a number of them to Pressburg, the hot-bed of\r\nBolshevism.\r\n\r\nM. Benes pointed out that if any pogroms occurred, which these reports\r\nforeshadowed, it would seriously prejudice his country and would\r\nalienate American sympathy, which in turn might result in discontinuing\r\nfood shipments to his country. He stated that he was a disciple of\r\nPresident Masaryk and always shared his liberal social and political\r\nviews; he said he would at once telegraph President Masaryk, who he knew\r\nwould do everything in his power to suppress the anti-Semitic agitation.\r\nWe were very much impressed with the enlightened statesmanship of M.\r\nBenes, who, since then, has shown himself to be one of the foremost\r\nstatesmen in middle Europe. He assured us at the time that any\r\npersecution of minorities in his country would be contrary to its\r\norganic laws, and in direct violation of the principles and policies\r\nupon which it had been determined to organize the State, and that we\r\ncould rely on it that no efforts would be spared in securing equal\r\njustice for all without regard to race or religion.\r\n\r\nFrom Sir Robert L. Borden, the Premier of Canada and one of the\r\ndelegates of the British Empire to the Peace Conference, I received on\r\nMarch 21st a copy of his memorandum on the several articles of the\r\nCovenant. I found them well conceived and in the main admirable. He\r\nopposed Article X as drafted. He wanted it either stricken out or\r\nclarified. I sent him a copy of a speech of Mr. Taft's of March 5th\r\nreferring to the same subject.\r\n\r\nAt the request of Colonel House, on April 11th, I had another conference\r\nwith M. Bourgeois. The Commission on the League of Nations of the\r\nfourteen nations, under the chairmanship of President Wilson, had the\r\nnight before held a protracted session discussing the revision of the\r\nCovenant, at which President Wilson offered the revised Article XXI\r\ncontaining the special provision regarding the Monroe Doctrine, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE XXI\r\n\r\n     Nothing in this Covenant shall be deemed to affect the validity of\r\n     international engagements such as treaties of arbitration or\r\n     regional understandings like the Monroe Doctrine for securing the\r\n     maintenance of peace.\r\n\r\nM. Larnaud and M. Bourgeois, the French representatives, both objected\r\nto specific reference to the Monroe Doctrine, and made long speeches in\r\nsupport of such objection. Colonel House desired me to impress upon M.\r\nBourgeois the reasons for this amendment and why it was necessary\r\nspecifically to mention the Monroe Doctrine, because, without it, it\r\nwould not be possible to have the Covenant confirmed by the Senate. As I\r\ndid not know M. Larnaud, I thought it best to discuss the subject with\r\nM. Bourgeois so that he might confer with his colleague. In company with\r\nBaron d'Estournelles de Constant, I called on M. Bourgeois at his\r\nresidence. I soon learned that M. Bourgeois did not object to specific\r\nreference to the Monroe Doctrine, but he desired, in return for his\r\nassent, to obtain President Wilson's assent to the amendments Bourgeois\r\nhad offered respecting a general staff and control or supervision of the\r\nmilitary force that each of the States was to supply to support the\r\nLeague. As the Commission was to meet again to finish the consideration\r\nof the Covenant, he agreed to confer with M. Clemenceau, saying he would\r\nhave to learn the other's views. He further said it must be determined\r\nhow best to formulate the article especially referring to the Monroe\r\nDoctrine so as not to conflict with the general provisions.\r\n\r\nAt the session of the Commission that evening at the Crillon Hotel,\r\nwhich lasted until after midnight, the article as quoted above,\r\nspecifically mentioning the Monroe Doctrine, was adopted. Colonel House\r\ngave me the exact wording of the article, which I at once cabled to the\r\nLeague to Enforce Peace in New York, with the request that Mr. Taft be\r\ninformed. The same day I received a cable from Mr. Taft and Dr. Lowell,\r\nforwarded by Acting Secretary of State Frank L. Polk, to the effect\r\nthat, in the opinion of the Executive Committee of the League, specific\r\nreference to the exclusion of the Monroe Doctrine from the jurisdiction\r\nof the Covenant of the League was absolutely necessary to secure\r\nconfirmation by the Senate. On the following day Taft cabled me that the\r\nMonroe Doctrine amendment was \"eminently satisfactory.\"\r\n\r\nI immediately advised President Wilson, sending him a copy of the cable.\r\nThe following day, I received the following letter from him:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     _18 April, 1919_\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR MR. STRAUS:\r\n\r\n     I have been very much cheered by your kind letter of yesterday,\r\n     with the message which it quotes from the League to Enforce Peace\r\n     and from Mr. Taft personally, and I want to thank you very warmly\r\n     for your own kind personal assurances of satisfaction with the\r\n     results of our work on the Covenant.\r\n\r\n                                  Cordially and sincerely yours\r\n                                                          WOODROW WILSON\r\n\r\nOn April 23d, on the invitation of Professor Stephen Hayes Bush, of the\r\nState University of Iowa, who was in charge of the Free Lecture Course\r\nof the American Expeditionary Force, I delivered an address in the Grand\r\nAmphitheatre of the Sorbonne. The great hall was filled with about one\r\nthousand of our officers and men who were taking courses at this ancient\r\ninstitution of learning. There were two lectures that afternoon, the\r\nother by M. Ferdinand Buisson, the noted educator. His subject was \"The\r\nEducational System of France,\" which he had done so much to develop\r\nsince the educational system had been secularized by the separation of\r\nChurch and State in France. He described why education had been taken\r\nfrom the control of the Catholic clergy, not out of hostility to the\r\nChurch, but in order not to prejudice the religious scruples of\r\nnon-clericals and non-Catholics.\r\n\r\nI took as my subject \"America and the League of Nations,\" and showed in\r\nwhat respect the Covenant provided definite sanctions to make peace\r\ndecisions effective. I pointed out that following the war, for the first\r\ntime in history, the dominant power of the world rested in\r\ndemocratically governed nations, and that theirs was the opportunity and\r\nthe responsibility to make provisions that such a war shall never be\r\nwaged again; and that now it was the duty of statesmanship to translate\r\nthe victory won in war into greater security for the future peace and\r\nhappiness of the world. I quoted from the speech of President Poincare\r\nin welcoming the Peace Delegates, in which he had described the reasons\r\nwhy America entered the World War. He had said: \"It was a supreme\r\njudgment passed at the bar of history by the lofty conscience of a free\r\npeople to rescue her mother from the humiliation of thralldom and to\r\nsave civilization.\"\r\n\r\nThat same evening, M. Nicolas W. Tchaikovsky, president of the Archangel\r\nGovernment of Northern Russia, called at my apartment to discuss with me\r\nconditions in Russia. I had met him before when he was in Washington in\r\n1907, after his escape from prison in Siberia. During several periods\r\nbefore that time he had lived in western United States, where he had\r\nengaged in farming. He had formerly belonged to the group of social\r\nrevolutionists. I spoke with him about the Hoover plan of sending food\r\ninto Russia, to which he replied that if an armed force could be sent\r\nthere it would be better, but that without an armed force the Bolsheviki\r\nwould use the provisions for their own red guard. I explained to him\r\nthat that could not be done, since the agents of the Food Administration\r\nwould themselves supervise the distribution, just as was done in Belgium\r\nduring the German occupation. He did not seem to think well of the whole\r\nplan and considered that it would be of advantage to the Bolsheviki\r\npolitically, and would make their people believe it was a recognition of\r\ntheir regime. He seemed to think that the Bolsheviki authorities could\r\nnot stop fighting in Russia even if they wanted to, as their several\r\ngenerals acted independently.\r\n\r\nHe spoke of Lenin as an honest, strong-headed, misguided fanatic, who he\r\nbelieved would in time discover his error and would have the moral\r\ncourage and honesty to throw up his hands. Trotsky, he said, was quite\r\nanother sort--an ambitious adventurer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Plenary Session of the Conference was called to order at the Quai\r\nd'Orsay on April 28th, at 3 P.M. I again attended with our official\r\ndelegate, former Ambassador Henry White. The representatives of the\r\nthirty nations were seated as before. I was given a seat just behind the\r\nAmerican Commission. The Session was presided over by M. Clemenceau, who\r\nshowed no signs of the effects of his recent wound by an assassin's\r\nbullet. He opened the session with a few words, then called on President\r\nWilson, who declared in a matter-of-fact way that, since he had read the\r\narticles of the Covenant to the Conference at the previous session\r\n(February 14th), and since all the delegates had the Covenant as amended\r\nbefore them, he would confine himself to pointing out the amendments and\r\nthe reasons therefor.\r\n\r\nThe immense hall was packed as on previous occasions. After President\r\nWilson had made his statement, which was rendered into French by the\r\nofficial interpreter, he moved several resolutions, one nominating Sir\r\nJames Eric Drummond as Secretary-General of the League, and one that\r\nBelgium, Brazil, Greece, and Spain should be members of the Council\r\npending the selection of the four additional States by the Assembly of\r\nthe League.\r\n\r\nAs chairman of the League to Enforce Peace, I wrote a letter to the\r\nPresident on the following day offering my congratulations upon the\r\nadoption of the Covenant. To this I received the following reply:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 PARIS, _1 May, 1919_\r\n\r\n      MY DEAR MR. STRAUS:\r\n\r\n     Thank you with all my heart for your generous letter of the 29th.\r\n     It has given me the greatest pleasure and encouragement, and I want\r\n     to take the opportunity to say how valuable in every way your own\r\n     support of and enthusiasm for the League of Nations has been. It is\r\n     a real pleasure to receive your unqualified approbation.\r\n\r\n                            Cordially and sincerely yours\r\n                                                            WOODROW WILSON\r\n\r\nAfter the Plenary Session on April 28th and the adoption of the Covenant\r\nof the League of Nations, I felt that my duties in Paris were at an end.\r\nThe winter had been very strenuous, and the weather had been very\r\ninclement--much rain and very little sunshine. I decided to take a rest,\r\nand was advised, because of some slight ailment in my left leg due to\r\nimpeded circulation, to take the baths at Bagnoles de l'Orne. The usual\r\nregime there is to take twenty-one baths. After I had taken eight, I\r\nreceived a letter from Colonel House saying that he would regard it most\r\nhelpful if I would return to America at as early a date as possible. He\r\ninformed me that the counsel for the American Commission, David Hunter\r\nMiller, was also returning; that passage had been secured for both of\r\nus on the U.S.S. Mount Vernon which was sailing from Brest on June 2d.\r\nHe stated that it would be rendering a valuable service if I would\r\nconfer with some of the Senators, so that they might be fully informed\r\nregarding the discussions and details of the negotiations as they\r\nprogressed.\r\n\r\nI accordingly returned to Paris, and on May 27th had a conference with\r\nColonel House, who again impressed upon me the services I might render\r\nin returning to the United States, since no one was more familiar than\r\nMr. Miller and I with the meaning and significance of the articles of\r\nthe Covenant; no one, therefore, was better qualified to answer the\r\ncriticisms and objections that had been made.\r\n\r\nIn the course of conversation, he said that in his opinion Woodrow\r\nWilson would not become a candidate again for President unless the\r\ntreaty were rejected, which might force him to run against his will in\r\norder to save the treaty; should the treaty, however, be ratified, there\r\nwould be no occasion for him to become a candidate.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe day before this, while I was paying a visit at the Hotel\r\nContinental, I met Jane Addams and Lillian Wald, and with them was\r\nAlexander Kerensky, the former Premier of Russia, They asked me to meet\r\nKerensky, which I did. He proved to be not at all the kind of man in\r\nappearance that I had pictured. He did not resemble the Russian type. He\r\nwas clean-shaven, rather spare, a little above medium height, and seemed\r\nabout forty years of age. He looked more like a student than like a\r\nleader who had stood in the storm-center of political turmoil.\r\n\r\nKerensky told me that he did not believe in Kolschak, principally\r\nbecause he regarded him as a tool of the Britain and Russian nobility.\r\nKerensky expressed himself as opposed to having the Allies recognize\r\nKolschak unless it was conditioned on definite guarantees that a free\r\ndemocratic election be held so that the people might decide what form of\r\ngovernment they desired.\r\n\r\nThe following day, Dr. Dluski, the Polish peace delegate, together with\r\nM. Lieberman, a Jewish member of the Polish Diet, called upon me to\r\nexplain, if not justify, the Polish pogroms, evidently because of the\r\ngreat publicity that had been given thereto by the mass meeting in New\r\nYork. The resolutions passed by that meeting, and presented to the\r\nPresident, had appeared in dispatches to European papers.\r\n\r\nWe left Paris for Brest on May 30th. The Mount Vernon, which was\r\nscheduled to sail on the following day, had postponed sailing until June\r\n3d. It carried some five thousand officers and men of the Sixth\r\nDivision. Dr. Mezes and his wife were also on board. Dr. Mezes, who is a\r\nbrother-in-law of Colonel House, organized the group of experts, of\r\nwhich he was chairman, which had rendered such valuable service to the\r\nCommission. We were all very comfortably provided for on the ship, and\r\nit was most interesting to observe the system and order with which the\r\nfive thousand officers and men were taken care of. They were a jolly\r\nlot, happy to return home, and without exception conducted themselves in\r\na correct and orderly manner. We had a delightful crossing; the weather\r\nwas fine and the sea was calm.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShortly after my return to the United States, the League to Enforce\r\nPeace called a meeting of the Executive Council to determine what action\r\nit could best take to further the ratification of the treaty which was\r\nnow being vigorously debated in the Senate. It was decided that Mr.\r\nVance McCormick and I should be a committee to confer with the\r\nPresident. We subsequently desired to add Dr. A. Lawrence Lowell,\r\npresident of Harvard University, to our number, provided it would be\r\nagreeable to the President, which Mr. McCormick was to ascertain when\r\narranging for the appointment. The President designated August 6th as\r\nthe day on which he would see us, and accordingly Dr. Lowell, Mr.\r\nMcCormick, the Secretary of the League, Dr. Short, and I went to the\r\nWhite House.\r\n\r\nPresident Wilson assured us that, while he was somewhat tired, he felt\r\nin good condition. He said he had had a number of conferences with\r\nindividual Senators who had objected to the ratification of the treaty,\r\nand that he had given them explanations regarding the main points in\r\ndispute, namely, Article X, guaranteeing against external aggression;\r\nArticle XXI, providing that nothing in the Covenant should be deemed to\r\naffect the validity of the Monroe Doctrine; and Article I, providing\r\nthat any member of the League may, after two years' notice, withdraw\r\nfrom the League. These were the main subjects covered by the\r\nreservations formulated by the moderate group headed by Senators Kellogg\r\nand McCumber.\r\n\r\nWe suggested that it might be of good result if the President could in\r\nsome public and formal way make his explanations and interpretations\r\nregarding these points. The question was how this could best be done.\r\nThe President believed it would be preferable if one of the Senators of\r\nthe opposition addressed to him a letter of inquiry, so framed as to\r\nenable the President to give his views. It was then understood that Dr.\r\nLowell, Mr. McCormick, and I should confer with Senator Hitchcock, the\r\nDemocratic leader of the minority of the Committee on Foreign Relations,\r\nwho could advise us as to what member of the Republican majority on the\r\ncommittee it would be best for us to confer with.\r\n\r\nAfter our conference with the President, we went to the Senate and found\r\nthe Committee on Foreign Relations in session, examining Secretary of\r\nState Lansing. Senator Hitchcock suggested that we call on Senator\r\nMcCumber, but as he was not then in Washington, Dr. Lowell and I called\r\non Senator Kellogg. The latter told us what we already knew, namely,\r\nthat he was in favor of the League and was scheduled to make his speech\r\nin the Senate advocating the ratification of the treaty with the\r\nreservations his group had formulated, which reservations he felt\r\nconfident were not in the nature of amendments, but interpretative only,\r\nand therefore would not require resubmission either to the Plenary\r\nSession or to Germany. Dr. Lowell and I outlined our plan regarding the\r\nletter to the President, asking for his interpretation of the articles\r\nabove referred to. While Senator Kellogg personally favored this plan,\r\nhe said he would first have to confer with the members of his group, and\r\nhe believed they would be favorably inclined. We then inquired whether\r\nthe President's interpretations and clarifications might not serve the\r\npurpose of making the reservations unnecessary. The Senator said \"no,\"\r\nbut that the reservations could recite the fact that they were based\r\nupon the President's interpretations. We arranged that Senators Kellogg\r\nand Hitchcock should confer upon the subject with a view of preparing\r\nsuch a tentative letter of inquiry which might be shown to the President\r\nin advance, and to which the President could reply, giving his\r\ninterpretations.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Senator Kellogg, we again called on Senator Hitchcock. In\r\nall of these conferences between the Senators of the various groups, we\r\nacted as the \"honest brokers\" for the League. Senator Hitchcock thought\r\nvery favorably of our plan and believed it would work out\r\nadvantageously. Dr. Lowell and I felt gratified with our day's work,\r\nthough, as matters developed, nothing came of this plan.\r\n\r\nIn this connection I cannot refrain from quoting a story which Dr.\r\nLowell told apropos of the problem. The story, as I recall it, was that\r\na noted colored preacher was holding a service in which he read a\r\nchapter from Isaiah referring to the Seraphim. After the service one of\r\nthe colored brethren asked the preacher what was \"the difference between\r\na Seraphim and a terrapin.\" The latter, rubbing his head, replied: \"My\r\nson, I grant you there is a difference, but they have made it up.\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, while there was, in words at least, if not in context, a\r\ndifference between the reservations offered by the Administration group,\r\nthe group of mild reservationists, and the majority group, yet, for\r\nreasons that I need not enter into here, they did not \"make it up.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn concluding this chapter and in closing these memoirs, I cannot resist\r\nreflecting how much wiser the Allied Powers and America were in the\r\nconduct of the war than in the making of peace, and afterwards. In war\r\nthey finally pooled their strength and won; in the peace terms they\r\nagain drew measurably apart. The men who framed the peace terms\r\nsubordinated world policies to home politics. The United States, by\r\nreason of a contest between the Administration and the majority group in\r\nthe Senate, allowed its sense of world responsibility to be negated by\r\npartisan differences. Reconstruction is being halted. And why? Because\r\nthe leading statesmen of the Entente Powers still lack the economic\r\nwisdom, or, what is the equivalent, the courage, to shape their\r\ninternational policies along world economic lines. My own country, in\r\nwithholding its cooperation, is equally culpable. The result is tension\r\nand derangement in the relationship of nations.\r\n\r\nAs the malady from which this and other countries are suffering is\r\nworld-wide, so must the remedy be world-wide. And America cannot free\r\nherself from the responsibility by isolating herself and refusing to do\r\nher part in applying the remedial measures necessary to restore normal\r\nconditions. The remedy does not consist in the lessening or weakening of\r\nsovereignty by individual states. It consists in the enlargement of\r\ntheir sovereign functions in concert with and in just relations to other\r\nstates for the administration of common interests. It requires no\r\nsurrender of sovereignty for individual states to conform their policies\r\nto the world's common needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE END\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Index\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\nThroughout the index, _S._ stands for the author.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Aaronson, Aaron, 418.\r\n\r\n  Abbott, Ernest, 183, 188.\r\n\r\n  Abbott, Lawrence F., _Impressions of Theodore Roosevelt_, 263, 264,\r\n        290, 311; 174, 254, 289.\r\n\r\n  Abbott, Lyman, 122, 183, 184, 188, 272, 311, 395.\r\n\r\n  Abdul Aziz, Sultan, 298.\r\n\r\n  Abdul Hamid II, Sultan, difficulty of obtaining audience with, 58, 59;\r\n    at Selamlik, 63, 64;\r\n    feared assassination, 64;\r\n    _S._'s long-delayed audience, 67-69;\r\n    physical aspect of, 68;\r\n     and Baron de Hirsch, 93;\r\n    _S._ again received by, 99;\r\n    permits excavations in Babylonia, 100;\r\n    his obligation to _S._, 100, 101;\r\n    _S._'s farewell audience, 102, 103;\r\n    decorates Mrs. Straus, 104;\r\n    welcomes return of _S._, as minister, 134;\r\n    does not favor raising U.S. mission to embassy, 135;\r\n    \"the whole show,\" 136;\r\n    receives German Emperor, 137, 138, 139;\r\n    and the indemnities due to missionaries, 141, 142;\r\n    and Mohammedans in the Philippines, 143 _ff._;\r\n    instructs them to submit to U._S._ army, 146, 159;\r\n    and foreign visitors, 152;\r\n    increased power of, 153;\r\n    his gift to _S._, 155, 156; 72, 97, 98, 157, 276, 277, 279, 282, 292.\r\n\r\n  Abraham, 157.\r\n\r\n  Adams, John, 258.\r\n\r\n  Adams, John Quincy, 260.\r\n\r\n  Addams, Jane, 425.\r\n\r\n  Adee, Alvey A., 48, 91, 98.\r\n\r\n  Adler, Cyrus, 240, 252.\r\n\r\n  Africa, Northern, Italy seeks territory in, 340.\r\n\r\n  Aguinaldo, Emilio, fails to arouse Sulu Mohammedans to revolt, 146.\r\n\r\n  Ahmed Riga Bey, 298, 299.\r\n\r\n  Alaska salmon fisheries, protection of, 235, 236.\r\n\r\n  Alaskan boundary question, 173, 174.\r\n\r\n  Alexiefsky, Alexandre, 392, 393.\r\n\r\n  Algeciras Conference, 192.\r\n\r\n  Algiers, motoring through, 343.\r\n\r\n  Alliance Israelite (Paris), 167, 359.\r\n\r\n  Allied Societies for a League of Nations, conference of, 415, 416.\r\n\r\n  Alphonso XIII, of Spain, 361.\r\n\r\n  American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, and _S._'s\r\n        appointment to Turkey, 45, 49.\r\n\r\n  American citizens, naturalized, rights of, in foreign countries, 163,\r\n        332, 333.\r\n\r\n  American College for Girls, 297.\r\n\r\n  American diplomats, meager salaries of, 102.\r\n\r\n  American Jews in Turkey, 80, 81, 82.\r\n\r\n  _American Journal of International Law_, quoted, 335; 336.\r\n\r\n  American politics, two main currents in, 307.\r\n\r\n  American Society of International Law, 334-336.\r\n\r\n  Americanism, Roosevelt quoted on, 183.\r\n\r\n  Americans, stranded in London, committee for relief of, 371 _ff._\r\n\r\n  Ames, James B., 160.\r\n\r\n  Amos, Morris S., 172.\r\n\r\n  Anarchists, exclusion and deportation of, 231, 232;\r\n    defined in Act of 1907, 232.\r\n\r\n  Anderson, Chandler P., 372.\r\n\r\n  Andreades, Professor, 415.\r\n\r\n  Andrews, E.
