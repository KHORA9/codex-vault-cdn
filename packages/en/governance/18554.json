Daily, semi-weekly, or weekly did Fenno, Porcupine Cobbett,\r\nDennie, Coleman, and the other Federal journalists, not content with\r\nproclaiming him an ambitious, cunning, and deceitful demagogue, ridicule\r\nhis scientific theories, shudder at his irreligion, sneer at his\r\ncourage, and allude coarsely to his private morals in a manner more\r\ndiscreditable to themselves than to him; crowning all their accusations\r\nand innuendoes with a reckless profusion of epithet. While at the same\r\ntimes and places the whole company of the Democratic press, led by\r\nBache, Duane, Cheetham, Freneau, asserted with equal energy that he was\r\nthe greatest statesman, the profoundest philosopher, the very sun of\r\nrepublicanism, the abstract of all that was glorious in democracy. And\r\nif Abraham Bishop, of New Haven, Connecticut, compared him with Christ,\r\na great many New Englanders of more note than Bishop, pronounced him the\r\nman of sin, a malignant manifestation of Satan. On one or the other of\r\nthese two scales he was placed by every man in the United States,\r\naccording to each citizen's modicum of sense and temper. We say, every\r\nman--because in that war of the Democrats against the Federalists, no\r\none sought to escape the service. Every able-tongued man was ready to\r\nfight with it, either for Jefferson or against him.\r\n\r\nWhen Jefferson passed away triumphant, toleration set in. His enemies\r\ndropped him to turn upon living prey. They came to acquiesce in him, and\r\neven to quote him when he served their purpose. But the admiration of\r\nhis followers did not abate. They canonized him as the apostle of\r\nAmerican democracy, and gave his name to the peculiar form of the\r\ndoctrine they professed. For many years the utterances of the master\r\nwere conclusive to the common men of the party--better far than the\r\narguments of any living leader. Of late we have heard less of him. The\r\nright wing of the democracy begin to doubt the expediency of the States'\r\nRights theory; and with the wrong wing his standing has been injured by\r\nthe famous passage on slavery in the 'Notes on Virginia.' The wrong wing\r\nof the Democratic party are the men who cry out for the 'Constitution as\r\nit is, and the Union as it was'--a cry full of sound and often of fury;\r\nbut what does it signify? The first gun that was fired at Fort Sumter\r\nshattered the old Union. If peace men and abolitionists, secessionists\r\nand conservatives were to agree together to restore the old Union to the\r\n_status quo ante bellum_, they could not do it. 'When an epoch is\r\nfinished,' as Armand Carrel once wrote, 'the mould is broken, it cannot\r\nbe made again.' All that can be done is to gather up the fragments, and\r\nto use them wisely in a new construction. An Indian neophyte came one\r\nday to the mission, shouting: 'Moses, Isaiah, Abraham, Christ, John the\r\nBaptist!' When out of breath, the brethren asked him what he meant. 'I\r\nmean a glass of cider.' If the peace party were as frank as the Indian,\r\nthey would tell us that their cry signifies place, power, self. The\r\nprodigal sons of the South are to be lured back by promises of pardon,\r\nindemnification, niggers _ad libitum_, before they have satiated\r\nthemselves with the husks which seem to have fallen to their portion,\r\nand are willing to confess that they have sinned against heaven and\r\nagainst their country. The arms of the peace men are open; the best\r\nrobe, the ring, the fatted calf are ready. All that is asked in return\r\nis a Union (as it was) of votes, influence, and contributions, to place\r\nthe party in power and to keep it there.\r\n\r\nThese misguided Democrats owe to Jefferson the war cries they shout and\r\nthe arms they are using against the Government. His works are an arsenal\r\nwhere these weapons of sedition are arranged ready for use, bright and\r\nin good order, and none of them as yet superseded by modern\r\nimprovements. He first made excellent practice with the word\r\n'unconstitutional,' an engine dangerous and terrible to the\r\nAdministration against which it is worked; and of easy construction, for\r\nit can be prepared out of anything or nothing. Jefferson found it very\r\neffective in annoying and embarrassing the Government in his campaigns.\r\nBut as he foresaw that the time must come when the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States would overpower this attack, he adapted, with great\r\ningenuity, to party warfare the theory of States' Rights, which in 1787\r\nhad nearly smothered the Constitution in its cradle. This dangerous\r\ncontrivance he used vigorously against the alien and sedition law,\r\nwithout considering that his blows were shaking the Union itself. Mr.\r\nCalhoun looked upon the Kentucky Resolutions (Jefferson's own work) as\r\nthe bill of rights of nullification, and wrote for a copy of them in\r\n1828 to use in preparing his manifesto of the grievances of South\r\nCarolina. It is unnecessary to allude to the triumph of these doctrines\r\nat the South under the name of secession.\r\n\r\nAs Jefferson soon perceived that a well-disciplined band of needy\r\nexpectants was the only sure resort in elections, he hit upon rotation\r\nin office as the cheapest and most stimulating method of paying the\r\nregular soldiers of party for their services (if successful) on these\r\ncritical occasions. But as a wise general not only prepares his attack,\r\nbut carefully secures a retreat in case his men push too far in the heat\r\nof conflict, Jefferson suggested the plan of an elective judiciary,\r\nwhich he foresaw might prove of great advantage to those whose zeal\r\nshould outrun the law. He even recommended rebellion in popular\r\ngovernments as a political safety valve; and talked about Shay's War and\r\nthe Whiskey Insurrection in the same vein and almost the same language\r\nthat was lately used to the rioters of New York by their friends and\r\nfellow voters. And he and his followers shouted then, as their\r\ndescendants shout now, 'Liberty is in danger!' 'The last earthly hope of\r\nrepublican institutions resides in our ranks!' Jefferson is also\r\nentitled to the credit of naturalizing in the United States the phrases\r\nof the French Revolution: virtue of the people; reason of the people;\r\nnatural rights of man, etc.--that Babylonish dialect, as John Adams\r\ncalled it, which in France meant something, but in this country was\r\nmere cant. Jefferson knew that here all were people, and that no set of\r\nmen, whether because of riches or of poverty, had the right to arrogate\r\nto themselves this distinction. But he also knew that in Europe this\r\ndistinction did exist, and that the emigrants who were coming in such\r\nnumbers all belonged to the lower class, there called people. Of course\r\nthese flattering phrases would win their ears and their votes for the\r\npeople's ticket, against an imaginary aristocracy. Thus might be secured\r\nan army of obedient voters, knowing nothing but their orders, and\r\nthinking of nothing but the pleasing idea that they were the rulers.\r\n\r\nThese useful inventions are enough to immortalize any man. His theory,\r\nthat the rich only should be taxed, as an indirect form of agrarianism,\r\nought not to be forgotten, for we see it daily carried out; and his\r\ndarling doctrine, that no generation can bind its successors, will come\r\nto light again and life whenever a party may think the repudiation of\r\nour war debt likely to be a popular measure. Indeed, there is scarcely a\r\nform of disorganization and of disorder which Jefferson does not extract\r\nfrom some elementary principle or natural right. We do not mean to\r\naccuse him of doing wrong deliberately. Jefferson was an optimist. All\r\nwas for the best--at least, all that he did; for he was naturally\r\npredisposed to object to any measure which did not originate with\r\nhimself or had not been submitted to his judgment. His elementary\r\nprinciples were always at his call. They were based upon reason: how\r\ncould they be wrong? His mind grasped quickly all upon the surface that\r\nsuited his purpose; deeper he did not care to go. In deciding whether\r\nany political doctrine was consistent or inconsistent with natural\r\nreason, he generally judged of it by his reason--and this varied with\r\nhis position, his interest, his feelings. He probably was not aware of\r\nthe extent of his mutations; his mind was fixed on the results to be\r\nobtained--always the same: the gratification of his wishes. His was a\r\nVicar-of-Bray kind of logic. The ultimate results of his dealings, as\r\naffecting others and the nation at large, he apparently was unable to\r\nconsider, or put them aside for the time; taking it for granted, in a\r\ncareless way, that all must come well.\r\n\r\nThus as times changed, he changed with them. Laws, measures, customs,\r\nmen, that seemed useful and praiseworthy when he was a private\r\nindividual, appeared pernicious and wicked to the Secretary of State or\r\nto the President. His life and writings are full of self-contradictions,\r\nor rather of self-refutations, for he seems to forget that he had ever\r\nthought differently. Men of sense modify their opinions as they advance\r\nin years and in wisdom, but very few men of sense have held\r\ndiametrically different opinions on almost every important question that\r\nhas come before them.\r\n\r\nJefferson satisfied himself early in life that slavery was wrong,\r\nmorally and economically. On no subject has he expressed himself more\r\ndecidedly. When a very young member of the Assembly of Virginia, he\r\nseconded Colonel Bland's motion to extend the protection of the laws to\r\nslaves. Bland was treated roughly, and the matter dropped. From\r\nJefferson's original draft of the Declaration of Independence a long\r\npassage on the iniquity of slavery and the slave trade was stricken out\r\nby Congress. In 1778 he introduced a bill prohibiting the importation of\r\nslaves into Virginia. Two years later he wrote the well-known pages in\r\nthe 'Notes.' In 1783 it was proposed to adopt a new constitution in\r\nVirginia; Jefferson drew one up, and inserted an article granting\r\nliberty to all persons born of slave parents after the year 1800. From\r\nthat time his zeal began to cool. He perceived that his views were\r\nunpopular at the South. The 'Notes' had been printed for private\r\ncirculation only; when Châstellux asked permission to publish them in\r\nFrance, Jefferson consented on the condition that all passages relating\r\nto slavery should be stricken out.[A] Although he adopted so heartily\r\nthe most extravagant doctrines of the French Revolution on the natural\r\nrights of mankind, among which liberty, equality, fraternity certainly\r\nranked first, he quietly ignored the claims of the American black to a\r\nshare in the bright future that was promised to the human race. The act\r\nof Congress prohibiting the importation of slaves came into force in\r\n1808. It was well received by slave owners, for it increased the value\r\nof the homemade 'article.' Jefferson could safely approve of it. He did\r\nso warmly. With that exception his silence on this great question was\r\nprofound during the period of his power; but he had no language too\r\ntheatrical for liberty in the abstract, nor too violent for despots who\r\nwere three thousand miles away, and with whose oppressions the people of\r\nthe United States had no concern whatever. When the debates on the\r\nadmission of Missouri brought up this ever-recurring question again to\r\nthe exclusion of all others, Jefferson spoke to sneer at the friends of\r\nfreedom. The Federalists had found out that their cherished monarchical\r\n'form' would get them no adherents, and so were trying to throw a new\r\ntub to the whale by appealing to the virtuous sentiments of the people.\r\nHe was in favor of making Missouri a Slave State. To extend the area of\r\nslavery would increase the comfort of the slaves without adding one more\r\nto their number, and would improve their chances for emancipation. It\r\nwould also relieve Virginia from the burden that was weighing her\r\ndown--slaves being rather cheaper there than horses--and would enable\r\nher to export her surplus crop of negroes; perhaps eventually to dispose\r\nof them all. This last notion, by the way, gives us a pretty good idea\r\nof Jefferson's practical knowledge of political economy.\r\n\r\nHis chief objection to the new constitution, when he first saw it, was\r\nthe omission in it of a bill of rights providing for the 'eternal and\r\nunremitting force of the habeas corpus act'--and for the freedom of the\r\npress. When Colonel Burr was arrested, Jefferson, who, by the way,\r\nshowed a want of dignity and self-respect throughout the affair, was\r\neager to suspend the habeas corpus act, and got a bill to that effect\r\npassed by one branch of Congress; it was lost in the other. This was the\r\nfirst instance in the history of the United States. The many fine things\r\nhe had said on the integrity and independence of judges did not prevent\r\nhim from finding bitter fault with Chief-Justice Marshall for not\r\nconvicting Burr. He accused Marshall and the whole tribe of Federalists\r\nof complicity in Burr's conspiracy. Poor old Paine, then near his end,\r\nwho was one of Jefferson's jackals of the press, informed the\r\nChief-Justice, through the _Public Advertiser_, that he was 'a suspected\r\ncharacter.' When Jefferson had felt the pricking of the Federal quills,\r\nhe began to think differently of the freedom of the press. Once, in the\r\nsafety of private station, he had got off this antithesis: if he had to\r\nchoose between a government without newspapers, and newspapers without a\r\ngovernment, he should prefer the latter. But when in his turn he felt\r\nthe stings that previously, under his management, had goaded even\r\nWashington out of his self-control, Jefferson could not help saying that\r\n'a suspension of the press would not more completely deprive the nation\r\nof its benefits than is done by its abandoned prostitution to\r\nfalsehood.'\r\n\r\nBefore September, 1791, Mr. Jefferson thought that our affairs were\r\nproceeding in a train of unparalleled prosperity, owing to the real\r\nimprovements of the Government, and the unbounded confidence reposed in\r\nit by the people. Soon a jealousy of Hamilton came upon him, and the\r\ndispleasure of playing a second part: he began to look for relief in the\r\nranks of the malcontents. He then perceived monarchical longings in the\r\nAdministration party, and prophesied corruption, despotism, and a loss\r\nof liberty forever, if they were to be allowed to interpret the\r\nConstitution in their way. Washington was the Atlas whose broad\r\nshoulders bore up the Federalists. Bache, of the _Aurora_, with whom\r\nJefferson's word was law, and Freneau, of the _Gazette_, who had\r\nreceived from Jefferson a clerkship in the Department of State, accused\r\nthe General of a desire to subvert the Constitution: the reserve of his\r\nmanners was said to proceed from an affectation of royalty; they even\r\nventured to charge him with perverting the public money. Jefferson\r\nrefused to check these base attacks, and wrote in the same vein himself\r\nin the famous letter to Mazzei. But after the battle had been fought, he\r\nperceived that Washington had a hold stronger than party feelings on the\r\naffections of Americans. It would never do to leave his name and fame in\r\nthe custody of Federalists. And so Mr. Jefferson turned about and denied\r\nthat he had ever made any charges against General Washington. On the\r\ncontrary, he felt certain that Washington did not harbor one principle\r\nof Federalism. He was neither an Angloman, a monarchist, nor a\r\nseparatist. Bache he (Jefferson) knew nothing about; over Freneau he had\r\nno control; and the Mazzei letter had been misprinted and\r\nmisinterpreted. In spite of his hatred of England, and his fears lest\r\nthe English 'form' should be adopted in the United States, Jefferson, in\r\n1788, had recommended the English form to Lafayette for the use of\r\nFrance. And in spite of the admiration for France, which with him and\r\nthe Democrats was an essential article of the party faith, he took\r\noffence with the French Government because they sided with Spain in the\r\ndispute on the boundary line between Louisiana and Florida, and proposed\r\nto Madison an alliance with England against France and Spain. But\r\nMadison kept him steady. Six months later he accused John Randolph, who\r\nhad abandoned the party, of entertaining the intolerable heresy of a\r\nleague with England.\r\n\r\nMr. Jefferson once thought it necessary that the United States should\r\npossess a naval force. It would be less dangerous to our liberties than\r\nan army, and a cheaper and more effective weapon of offence. 'The sea is\r\nthe field on which we should meet a European enemy.' 'We can always have\r\na navy as strong as the weaker nations.' And he suggested that thirty\r\nships, carrying 1,800 guns, and manned by 14,400 men, would be an\r\nadequate force. But the New Englanders, those bitter Federalists, loved\r\nthe sea, lived by foreign trade, and wanted a fleet to protect their\r\nmerchantmen. Mr. Jefferson's views became modified. He took a strong\r\ndislike to the naval service. He condemned the use of the navy by the\r\nlate President, and wished to sell all the public armed vessels.\r\nFinding, however, that the maritime tastes of the nation were too strong\r\nfor him, he hit upon the plan of a land navy as the nearest\r\napproximation to no navy at all. Gunboats were to be hauled out of the\r\nwater, and kept in drydocks under sheds, in perfect preservation. A\r\nfleet of this kind only needed a corps of horse marines to complete its\r\nefficiency. The Federalists laughed at these 'mummy frigates,' and sang\r\nin a lullaby for Democratic babes this stanza:\r\n\r\n  'In a cornfield, high and dry,\r\n     Sat gunboat Number One;\r\n   Wiggle waggle went her tail,\r\n     Pop went her gun.'\r\n\r\nThe pleasantry is feeble; but the inborn absurdity of this amphibious\r\nscheme was too great even for the Democrats. Mr. Jefferson was forced,\r\nin the teeth of theory, to send a squadron against the Barbary pirates.\r\nHe consoled himself by ordering the commodore not to overstep the\r\nstrict line of defence, and to make no captures. It was to be a display\r\nof latent force. Strange as it may seem, he once doubted the expediency\r\nof encouraging immigration. Emigrants from absolute monarchies, as they\r\nall were, they would either bring with them the principles of government\r\nimbibed in early youth, or exchange these for an unbounded\r\nlicentiousness. 'It would be a miracle were they to stop precisely at\r\nthe point of temperate liberty.' Would it not be better for the nation\r\nto grow more slowly, and have a more 'homogeneous, more peaceable, and\r\nmore durable' government? But when it was found at a later day that the\r\nnew comers placed themselves at once in opposition to the better classes\r\nand voted the Democratic ticket almost to a man, Jefferson proposed that\r\nthe period of residence required by the naturalization laws to qualify a\r\nvoter should be shortened. He had no objection to coercion before 1787.\r\nSpeaking of the backwardness of some of the colonies in paying their\r\nquota of the Confederate expenses, he recommends sending a frigate to\r\nmake them more punctual. 'The States must see the rod, perhaps some of\r\nthem must be made to feel it.' His somersets of opinion and conduct are\r\nendless. Once he talked of opening a market in the neighboring colonies\r\nby force; at another time he advised his countrymen to abandon the sea\r\nand let other nations carry for us; in 1785 we find him going abroad to\r\nnegotiate commercial treaties with all Europe. He objected to internal\r\nimprovements, and he sanctioned the Cumberland road. He proclaimed all\r\ngovernments naturally hostile to the liberties of the people, until he\r\nhimself became a government. He made the mission to Russia for Mr.\r\nShort, regardless of repeated declarations that the public business\r\nabroad could be done better with fewer and cheaper ambassadors. The\r\nunlucky sedition law was so unconstitutional in his judgment that he\r\nfelt it to be his duty, as soon as he mounted the throne, to pardon all\r\nwho had been convicted under it. But before he left the White House he\r\nattempted to put down Federal opposition in the same way. Judges were\r\nimpeached; United States attorneys brought libel suits against editors,\r\nand even prosecuted such men as Judge Reeve and the Rev. Mr. Backus of\r\nConnecticut. It was a pet doctrine of Jefferson that one generation had\r\nno right to bind a succeeding one; hence every constitution and all laws\r\nshould become null and every national debt void at the end of nineteen\r\nyears, or of whatever period should be ascertained to be the average\r\nduration of human life after the age of twenty-one. He adhered to this\r\nnotion through life, although Mr. Madison, when urged by him to expound\r\nit, gently pointed out its absurdity. When the news of the massacres of\r\nSeptember reached the United States at an unfortunate moment for the\r\nFrancoman party, Jefferson forgot this elementary principle and his\r\nlogic. He professed that he deplored the bloody fate of the victims as\r\nmuch as any man, but they had perished for the sake of future\r\ngenerations, and that thought consoled him. Finally, the man who had\r\nannounced in a public address, that he considered it a moral duty never\r\nto subscribe to a lottery, nor to engage in a game of chance, petitioned\r\nthe Legislature of Virginia for permission to dispose of his house and\r\nlands in a raffle, and in his memorial recapitulated his services to the\r\ncountry to strengthen his claim upon their indulgence.\r\n\r\nJefferson professed great faith in human nature; but he meant the human\r\nnature of the uneducated and the poor. Kings, rulers, nobles, rich\r\npersons, and generally all of the party opposed to him, were hopelessly\r\nwrong. The errors of the people, when they committed any, were\r\naccidental and momentary; but in the other class, they were proofs of an\r\nineradicable perversity. His faith in human reason as the only power\r\nfor good government must have been shaken by the students of his\r\nuniversity in Virginia. Their lawless conduct seemed to indicate that\r\nthe time had hardly yet come when the old and vulgar method of authority\r\nand force could be dispensed with. The University of Virginia was a\r\nfavorite project of Jefferson and an honorable memorial of his love of\r\neducation and of letters. Although it may be considered a failure, it\r\nhas failed from no fault of his. But we may judge of the real extent of\r\nJefferson's toleration, when we read in a letter written about this\r\nuniversity: 'In the selection of our law professor we must be rigorously\r\nattentive to his political principles.'\r\n\r\nIt is easy to know what would be Jefferson's position if by some miracle\r\nof nature he were living in these times. If at the South, he would be a\r\nman of brave words--showing it to be a natural right of the white man to\r\nown and to chastise his negro--and proving, from elementary principles,\r\nthat slavery is the result of the supremacy of reason and the corner\r\nstone of civilized society. Had the advantages of the North led him to\r\ndesert Monticello for the banks of the Hudson, he would have opposed the\r\nAdministration, acting and talking much like a certain high official,\r\n'letting I dare not wait upon I would'--for Jefferson was not a bold\r\nman, was master of the art of insinuating his opinions instead of\r\nstating them manfully, and never advanced so far as to make retreat\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that there was nothing great nor even imposing in\r\nJefferson's mental nor in his moral qualities. He expressed himself well\r\nin conversation and on paper, although a little pedagogical in manner,\r\nand too much given to epithet in style. The literary claims of the\r\nauthor of the Declaration of Independence cannot be passed over lightly.\r\nHis mind was active; catching quickly the outlines of a subject, he\r\njumped at the conclusion which pleased his fancy, without looking\r\nbeneath the surface.[B] He was curious in all matters of art,\r\nliterature, and science, but his curiosity was easily appeased. He raves\r\nabout Ossian, gazes for hours on the Maison Carrée at Nismes, writes\r\nletters to Paine on arcs and catenaries, busies himself with\r\nvocabularies, natural history, geology, discourses magisterially about\r\nNewton and Lavoisier, and studies nothing thoroughly. One can see by the\r\nway in which he handles his technical terms that he does not know the\r\nuse of them. He was a smatterer of that most dangerous kind, who feel\r\ncertain they have arrived at truth. Like so many other children of the\r\neighteenth century, he rejected the past with disdain, but was blindly\r\ncredulous of the future; and was ready to embrace an absurdity if it\r\ncame in a new and scientific shape. The marquises and abbés he met in\r\nFrance had dreamed over elementary principles of society and government,\r\nuntil they had lost themselves in wandering mazes like Milton's\r\nspeculative and erring angels. He believed that those gay _philosophes_\r\nhad discovered the magical stone of social science, and that misery and\r\nsin would be transmuted into virtue and happiness. It was only necessary\r\nto kill all the kings and to confide in the reason and virtue of the\r\npeople, and the thing was done. The scenes of 1789 stimulated\r\nJefferson's natural tendency beyond the bounds of common sense. He\r\nasserted that Indians without a government were better off than\r\nEuropeans with one, and that half the world a desert with only an Adam\r\nand Eve left in each country to repopulate it would be an improvement in\r\nthe condition of Europe. He became a bigot of liberalism. Luckily he\r\nhad his American blood and practical education to restrain him, or he\r\nmight have been as foolish as Brissot and as rabid as Marat. As it was,\r\nhe could not help perceiving in his calmer moments that this new path to\r\nthe glorious future which the _philosophes_ were pointing out to their\r\ncountrymen, had been for many years in America the well-worn high road\r\nof the nation.\r\n\r\nOn most subjects, Jefferson's opinions were dictated by his feelings. He\r\ntakes so little pains to conceal this weakness, that we can hardly\r\nsuppose he was aware of it. Contradiction he could not bear. Opposition\r\nof any kind produced a bitter feeling. Vanity, latent perhaps, but\r\nacrid, corroded his judgment of his adversaries. In France Governeur\r\nMorris remarked that he was too fond of calling fools those who did not\r\nagree with him; a sure sign of want of strength. Great minds are\r\nessentially tolerant of the opinions of others. They know how easy it is\r\nto err. There was a good deal, too, of the Pharisee about Jefferson. 'He\r\nwas of no party, nor yet a trimmer between parties. If he could not go\r\nto heaven but with a party, he would not go there at all.' But he\r\nthanked God he was not as the Federalists were: Anglomen, monarchists,\r\nworkers of corruption! nor even as this Washington! He boasted, too,\r\nthat he had never written a line for the public press; his method was to\r\nsuggest his views to others, and employ them to put them into print.\r\n\r\nCareful not to speak out too boldly when it was not altogether safe to\r\ndo so, and wanting rather in moral courage, he was a persevering man,\r\npursuing his plans with the eagerness of women, who always have a\r\nthousand excellent reasons, however illogical and inconsistent they may\r\nbe, for doing as they please--and like women, he was not over scrupulous\r\nas to the means he employed to reach his object.\r\n\r\nThe same envious vanity and inability to resist his feelings which\r\nwarped his judgment into so many contradictions, led him into actions\r\nthat have damaged his character as a gentleman. For instance, his\r\nbehavior to Washington. When a member of Washington's cabinet,\r\nprotesting the warmest friendship to him, his confidential adviser by\r\nvirtue of the office he held, he permitted, not to say encouraged, those\r\nattacks in Freneau's paper which were outrages on common decency. His\r\nintimacy with the President enabled him to judge of the effect of the\r\nblows. He noticed, with the cool precision of an experimental observer,\r\nthe symptoms of pain and annoyance which Washington could not always\r\nconceal. Freneau was Jefferson's clerk; a word would have stopped him.\r\n'But I will not do it,' Jefferson says; 'his paper has saved our\r\nConstitution, which was galloping forth into monarchy.' Jefferson's\r\nunderhand attack upon Vice-President Adams, in the note he wrote by way\r\nof preface to the American publisher of Paine's 'Rights of Man,' is a\r\ndomestic treachery of the same kind, though very much less in degree.\r\nThat note might have been written on the impulse of the moment; but what\r\nshall we say of his practice of committing to paper Hamilton's sayings\r\nin the freedom of after-dinner conversation--a time when open-hearted\r\nmen are apt to forget that there may be a Judas at table--and of saving\r\nthem up to be used against him in the future? Jefferson explains away\r\nthese and other dubious passages in his life with great ingenuity. He\r\nhad to make such explanations too often. An apology implies a mistake,\r\nwilful or accidental. Too many indicate, to say the least, a lack of\r\ndiscretion. What a difference between these explanations, evasions,\r\nexcuses, denials, and the majestic manliness of Washington, who never\r\ndid or wrote or said anything which he hesitated to avow openly and\r\nwithout qualification!\r\n\r\nAnother dissimilarity between these two worth heeding, is Jefferson's\r\nwant of that thrift which produces independence, comfort, and\r\nself-respect. He lived beyond his means, and died literally a beggar.\r\n\r\nJefferson was deficient in that happy combination of courage, energy,\r\njudgment, and probity, which mankind call character, for want of a more\r\ndistinctive word--but which, in fact, in its highest expression, is\r\ngenius on the moral side. It commands the respect of mankind more than\r\nthe most brilliant faculties--and it accomplishes more. We have only to\r\nlook at Washington's life to see what can be done by it.\r\n\r\nWhen Governor of Virginia during the Revolutionary War, Jefferson showed\r\na want of spirit and of action; the same deficiency was more painfully\r\nconspicuous in his dealings with the Barbary pirates and in the affair\r\nof the Leopard and Chesapeake. The insults and spoliations of the\r\nEnglish and French under the orders in council and the Berlin and Milan\r\ndecrees were borne with equal meekness. He was for peace at all hazards,\r\nand economy at any price. When at last he found he had exhausted his\r\nfavorite method, and that neither 'time, reason, justice, nor a truer\r\nsense of their own interests' produced any effect upon the obstinate\r\naggressors, he could desire no better means of checking their\r\ndepredations upon our trade than to order our merchants to lay up their\r\nships and shut up their shops. It was a Japanese stroke of policy--to\r\nrevenge an insult by disembowelling oneself--hari kari applied to a\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nHis was indeed a brilliant theory of government, if we take him at his\r\nword. At home, freedom was to be invigorated by occasional rebellions,\r\nnot to be put down too sharply, for fear of discouraging the people--the\r\ntree of liberty was to be watered with blood. Abroad, custom-house\r\nregulations would keep the peace of the seas. Embargo and\r\nnon-intercourse must bring France and England to their good behavior.\r\n\r\nMr. Jefferson had his political panacea: all disorders would infallibly\r\nbe cured by it. He puffed it in his journals and extolled its virtues in\r\nhis state papers. He congratulated his countrymen upon his election; he\r\ncalled it the revolution of 1800. Now at length they could try the\r\npanacea. What wonders did it work? The Federalists can point to the\r\nresults of their twelve years of power: credit created out of\r\nbankruptcy; prosperity out of union; a great nation made out of thirteen\r\nsmall ones--an achievement far beyond that Themistocles could boast of.\r\nJefferson added the Louisiana Territory to the Union; but this, the only\r\nsolid result of his Administration, was totally inconsistent with his\r\nprinciples. Did he render any other service to the country? We know of\r\nnone. His 'Quaker' theories and 'terrapin' policy increased the contempt\r\nof our enemies, cost the nation millions of money to no purpose, and\r\nmade the war of 1812 inevitable.\r\n\r\nNo one can deny that Jefferson was a monster of party tactics and\r\nstrategy. He knew well how to get up a cry, to excite the _odium\r\nvulgare_ against his antagonists, to play skilfully upon the class\r\nfeeling of poor against rich, and to turn to profit every popular\r\nweakness and meanness. He drilled and organized his followers, and led\r\nthem well disciplined to victory. But on the grander field of\r\nstatesmanship he was wanting. He was what Bonaparte called an\r\nideologist. A principle, however true, may fail in its application,\r\nbecause other principles, equally true, may then come into action and\r\nvitiate the result. These collateral principles Jefferson never deigned\r\nto consider. He had no conception of expediency, of which a wise\r\nstatesman never loses sight. Results he thought must be advantageous,\r\nprovided processes were according to his principles. His object appears\r\nto have been rather a government after his theories than a good\r\ngovernment. And in this respect he is the type of the impracticable and\r\nmischief-making class of reformers numerous in this country.\r\n\r\nJefferson seems to have been unable to grasp the real political\r\ncharacter of the American people, the path they were destined to tread,\r\nthe shape their institutions must necessarily take. He was possessed\r\nwith the idea that liberty was in danger, and that the attempt was made\r\nto change the republic into a monarchy, perhaps a despotism. This\r\ndelirious fancy beset him by day and was a terror by night. He was\r\nhaunted by the likeness of a kingly crown. Hamilton and Adams were\r\nwriting and planning to place it upon somebody's head. Federalist\r\nsenators, congressmen, Revolutionary soldiers, were transformed into\r\nmonarchists and Anglomen. Grave judges appeared to his distempered\r\nvision in the guise of court lawyers and would-be ambassadors. The\r\nCincinnati lowered over the Constitution eternally. The Supreme Court of\r\nthe United States was the stronghold in which the principle of\r\ntyrannical power, elsewhere only militant, was triumphant. Hamilton's\r\nfunding system was a scheme to corrupt the country. Even the stately\r\nform of Washington rose before him in the shape of Samson shorn by the\r\nharlot England. Strange as it may seem, Jefferson persisted in his\r\ndelusion to the end. A man in his position ought to have seen that in\r\nspite of the old connection with the British crown, the States were and\r\nalways had been essentially republican in feelings, manners, and forms.\r\nNowhere in the world had local self-government been carried to such\r\nextent and perfection. To build up a monarchy out of the thirteen\r\ncolonies was impracticable. Washington, more clear sighted, said that\r\nany government but a republic was impossible: there were not ten men in\r\nthe United States whose opinions were worth attention who entertained\r\nthe thought of a monarchy. In his judgment the danger lay in the other\r\ndirection. The weakness of the Government, not its strength, might lead\r\nto despotism through license and anarchy. He desired to keep the rising\r\ntide of democracy within bounds by every legitimate barrier that could\r\nbe erected, lest it should overflow the country and sweep away all\r\ngovernment. Jefferson was for throwing open the floodgates to admit it.\r\nHe thought himself justified in combating the monarchists of his\r\nhallucinations by every means, however illegal and unconstitutional.\r\nWashington warned him and his followers that they were 'systematically\r\npursuing measures which must eventually dissolve the Union or produce\r\ncoercion.' Jefferson, deaf to the admonition, pressed on, and, like\r\nDiomede at the siege of Troy, wounded a divinity when he thought he was\r\ncontending only with fellow men. With his Kentucky Resolutions he gave\r\nthe first stab to the Union and the Constitution. What were Burr's\r\nchildish schemes, which would have fallen to the ground from their own\r\nweakness, compared with that? From Jefferson through Calhoun to\r\nJefferson Davis the diabolic succession of conspirators is complete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ENGLISH PRESS.\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has become the fashion to sneer at the Long Parliament: but for all\r\nthis it cannot be denied that that assemblage rendered services of\r\nincalculable importance to the state. Extreme old age forms at all times\r\nan object of pity, and, with the thoughtless and inconsiderate, it is\r\nbut too often an object of ridicule and contempt. Many a great man has,\r\nere now, survived to reach this sad stage in his career; but it does not\r\ntherefore follow that the glorious deeds of his prime are to be ignored\r\nor forgotten. As it has been with the distinguished warrior or statesman\r\nor author, so it is with the Long Parliament. England owes it a great\r\ndebt of gratitude on many accounts, but the one with which we have more\r\nespecially to do on the present occasion is, that with it originated the\r\ncustom of making public proceedings in Parliament. By this act was the\r\nsupremacy of the people over the Parliament acknowledged, for the very\r\npublication of its transactions was an appeal to the people for approval\r\nand support. This printed record of parliamentary affairs came out in\r\n1641, and was entitled _The Diurnal Occurrences, or Daily Proceedings of\r\nboth Houses in this great and happy Parliament, from the 3d of November,\r\n1640, to the 3d of November, 1641._ The speeches delivered from the\r\nfirst date down to the following June were also published in two\r\nvolumes, and in 1642 weekly instalments appeared under various titles,\r\nsuch as _The Heads of all the Proceedings of both Houses of\r\nParliament--Account of Proceedings of both Houses of Parliament--A\r\nperfect Diurnal of the Passages in Parliament_, etc., etc. There was no\r\nreporter's gallery in those days, and the Parliament only printed _what\r\nthey pleased_; still this was a step in the right direction. After\r\nParliaments occasionally evinced bitter hostility toward the press, but\r\nthat which boasted Sawyer Lenthal for its speaker was its friend (at all\r\nevents, at first, though afterward, as we shall notice by and by, it\r\ndisplayed some animosity against its early _protegé_), and from this\r\nmeagre beginning took its rise that which is beyond doubt one of the\r\nmost important domestic functions of the press at the present day.\r\n\r\nThe abolition of the great bugbear and tyrant of printers--that infamous\r\nmockery of a legal tribunal, the Star Chamber--was another gigantic\r\nobstacle cleared away from the path of journalism. The _Newes Bookes_,\r\nwhich, in spite of all difficulties, had already become abundant, now\r\nissued forth in swarms. They treated _de rebus omnibus et quibusdam\r\naliis_. Most of them were political or polemical pamphlets, and boasted\r\nextraordinary titles. There is a splendid collection of these in the\r\nBritish Museum, collected by the Rev. W. Thomason, and presented to the\r\nnation by King George III. We will mention a few of them. A\r\ncontroversial religious tract rejoices in the title of _A fresh bit of\r\nMutton for those fleshy-minded Cannibals that cannot endure Pottage._ A\r\npolitical skit upon Prince Rupert is styled _An exact Description of\r\nPrince Rupert's malignant She-Monkey, a great Delinquent_, and has a\r\ncomical woodcut upon the title page of the animal, in a cap and\r\npetticoat and with a sword by its side. This pamphlet is printed partly\r\nin ordinary modern type and partly in black letter. Another pamphlet in\r\nthe form of dialogue is directed against the abuses of the laws,\r\nespecially at one of the infamous 'comptoirs' of the time. It is called\r\n_Wonderfull Strange Newes from Wood Street Countor--yet not so Strange\r\nas True, being proved by lamentable Experience, the relation of which_\r\n\r\n  'Will make you laugh, 'twill make you cry;\r\n  'Twill make you mad, 'twill make you try.'\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother is _Newes, true Newes, laudable Newes, Citie Newes, Countrie\r\nNewes, the World is Mad or it is a Mad World, my Masters, especially in\r\nthe Antipodes, these Things are come to passe_. This is a satirical\r\ndescription of manners and customs on 'the other side of the world,' the\r\nwriter asserting that in those regions everything is the exact opposite\r\nof what takes place among us, so that there beggars ride in carriages\r\nand are highly esteemed, men of title are of no account, lawyers take no\r\nfees, and bailiffs decline to arrest debtors, etc., etc. There is also a\r\nvery quaint woodcut of the world and the heavens, the four winds, etc.,\r\nwith an astrologer and other persons looking at them. Very many of these\r\npamphlets are actual relations of occurrences in different parts of the\r\nkingdom and in foreign countries. Thus we find, _Victorious Newes from\r\nWaterford_; _The joyfullest Newes from Hull that ever came to London of\r\nthe Proceedings of the Earl of Warwick's Shipps_; _The best and happiest\r\nNewes from Ireland, from the Army before Kildare_; _Newes from\r\nBlackheath concerning the Meeting of the Kentish Men_; _Exceedingly\r\njoyfull Newes from Holland_; _The best Newes that ever was Printed_,\r\nconsists of, 1. _Prince Rupert's Resolution to bee gone to his Mother,\r\nwho hath sent for him_; 2. _His Majestie's royall Intentions declared to\r\njoyne with the Parliament in a treaty of Peace_; 3. _The Particulars of\r\nthe High Court of Parliament drawn up to be sent to his Majesty for\r\nPeace_; 4. _Directions from the Lords and Commons directed to the\r\nCommanders for the ordering of the Army._ One _quaint_ title presents a\r\nvery odd association: _Newes from Hell and Rome and the Innes of Court_.\r\nThe contending parties appear to have suited their titles to the\r\nsubstance of the _Newes_ they chronicled accordingly as it affected\r\ntheir interests. Thus, while many pamphlets bore the titles of\r\n_Glorious_, _Joyful_, _Victorious_, etc., others were dubbed _Horrible\r\nNewes_, _Terrible News_, and so forth. By far the greater number of\r\nthese were issued by the partisans of the Parliament; but the Royalists\r\nwere by no means idle, and the king carried about a travelling printing\r\npress, as is evidenced by several proclamations, manifestoes, etc.,\r\nissued at Oxford, Worcester, York, and other places, sometimes in\r\nordinary type, sometimes in black letter, by 'Robert Barker, his\r\nMajestie's Printer.' All the emanations of the press were not, however,\r\nmere isolated pamphlets, but there was a large crop of periodicals, such\r\nas _The Kingdom's Weekly Intelligencer_--_The Royal Diurnall_, etc.\r\nAbout this time the name _Mercurius_ began to be very freely adopted for\r\nthese periodicals. It had been already, for a long time, assumed as a\r\n_nom de plume_ by writers and printers, but the title was now\r\nassigned to the publications themselves. One of the earliest of\r\nthese was _Mercurius Aulicus_, a scurrilous print in the interest\r\nof the court party--as its name imports--which first appeared in 1642.\r\nOthers were entitled respectively _Mercurius Britannicus_--_Mercurius\r\nAnti-Britannicus_--_Mercurius Fumigosus, a Smoaking Nocturnal_--_Mercurius\r\nPragmaticus_--_Mercurius Anti-Pragmaticus_--_Mercurius Mercuriorum\r\nStultissimus_--_Mercurius Insanus Insanissimus_--_Mercurius\r\nDiabolicus_--_Mercurius Mastix, faithfully lashing all Scouts, Mercuries,\r\nPosts, Spyes, and others_--_Mercurius Radamanthus, the Chief Judge of Hell,\r\nhis Circuits through all the Courts of Law in England_, etc., etc. Other\r\nnewspapers bore such quaint titles as the following: _The Dutch Spye_--_The\r\nScots Dove_--_The Parliament Kite_--_The Secret Owle_--_The Parliament\r\nScreech Owle_, and other ornithological monstrosities. Party spirit ran\r\nhigh, and the contending scribes carried on a most foul and savage warfare,\r\nand demolished their adversaries, both political and literary, without\r\nthe slightest compunction or mercy. Some of these brochures were solely\r\ndirected against the utterances of one particular rival scribe, as is\r\nshown by one or two of the titles above quoted. Doctor Johnson says:\r\n\r\n     'When any title grew popular, it was stolen by the antagonist, who\r\n     by this stratagem conveyed his notions to those who would not have\r\n     received him had he not worn the appearance of a friend.'\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Nichols' the printer's list, there were no less than\r\nthree hundred and fifty of these _Mercuries_ and _Newes Bookes_\r\npublished between 1642 and 1665, a list that would no doubt be largely\r\nswollen could the titles of all that have perished and left no trace\r\nbehind be ascertained. These _Mercuries_ appeared at different\r\nintervals, but none oftener than three times a week, and their price was\r\ngenerally one penny, but sometimes twopence.\r\n\r\nMany of the writers were nothing but venal hirelings, and changed sides\r\nreadily enough when their own private interests seemed to render it\r\ndesirable. One of the most famous--or infamous, according to Anthony à\r\nWood, who describes him as 'a most seditious, mutable, and railing\r\nwriter, siding with the rout and scum of the people, making them weekly\r\nsport by railing at all that was noble,' etc.--was Marchmont Nedham. In\r\n1643 he brought out the _Mercurius Britannicus_, one of the ablest\r\nperiodicals on the Parliamentary side, whatever honest old Anthony may\r\nsay to the contrary. But, being imprisoned for libel, he thought it best\r\nto change his politics, and for two years appeared as an ultra-virulent\r\nRoyalist partisan in the _Mercurius Pragmaticus_. After the execution of\r\nCharles the First, however, he returned to his old party, and advocated\r\ntheir cause in the _Mercurius Politicus_, which purported to be\r\npublished 'in defence of the commonwealth and for information of the\r\npeople.' After some years he fell into temporary disgrace, but was soon\r\nreceived again into favor by the House of Commons, which passed a vote\r\nin August, 1659, 'that Marchmont Nedham, gentleman, be and hereby is\r\nrestored to be writer of the _Publick Intelligence_ as formerly.' At the\r\nRestoration he was discharged from his office, but contrived to make his\r\npeace with the party in power, and, true to his instincts, changed his\r\npolitical creed once more for that of the winning side, but without\r\nsucceeding in being reinstated in his old post. The other most\r\nnoteworthy writers of _Mercuries_ were John Birkenhead, author of the\r\n_Mercurius Aulicus_, Peter Heylin, Bruno Ryves--all parsons--and John\r\nTaylor, the Water Poet, author of the _Mercurius Aquaticus_.\r\n\r\nNothing was too great or too small for the writers of these _Mercuries_,\r\nnothing too exalted or too mean. Nothing was sacred in their eyes; the\r\nmost private affairs were dragged into the political arena, and family\r\nand domestic matters, that had nothing whatever to do with public life,\r\nwere paraded before the world. Bitter personalities and invective seem\r\nto be inseparable concomitants of the early stage of journalism in all\r\ncountries. This was the case in France and Germany; it is the case in\r\nRussia at the present day. That it was the case in America, let the\r\nfollowing extract from Franklin's private correspondence testify:\r\n\r\n     'The inconsistency that strikes me the most is that between the\r\n     name of your city, Philadelphia, and the spirit of rancor, malice,\r\n     and hatred that breathes in the newspapers. For I learn from those\r\n     papers that State is divided into parties, that each party ascribes\r\n     all the public operations of the other to vicious motives, that\r\n     they do not even suspect one another of the smallest degree of\r\n     honesty, that the anti-Federalists are such merely from the fear of\r\n     losing power, places, or emoluments, which they have in possession\r\n     or expectation; that the Federalists are a set of conspirators, who\r\n     aim at establishing a tyranny over the persons and property of\r\n     their countrymen and who live in splendor on the plunder of the\r\n     people. I learn, too, that your justices of the peace, though\r\n     chosen by their neighbors, make a villanous trade of their offices,\r\n     and promote discord to augment fees, and fleece their electors; and\r\n     that this would not be mended were the choice in the Executive\r\n     Council, who, with interested or party aims, are continually making\r\n     as improper appointments, witness a 'petty fiddler, sycophant, and\r\n     scoundrel' appointed judge of the admiralty, an 'old woman and\r\n     fomentor of sedition' to be another of the judges, and 'a Jeffreys'\r\n     chief justice, etc., etc., with 'harpies,' the comptroller and\r\n     naval officers, to prey upon the merchants, and deprive them of\r\n     their property by force of arms, etc. I am informed, also, by these\r\n     papers, that your General Assembly, though the annual choice of the\r\n     people, shows no regard to their rights, but from sinister views or\r\n     ignorance makes laws in direct violation of the Constitution, to\r\n     divest the inhabitants of their property, and give it to strangers\r\n     and intruders, and that the Council, either fearing the resentment\r\n     of their constituents or plotting to enslave them, had projected to\r\n     disarm them, and given orders for that purpose; and, finally, that\r\n     your President, the unanimous joint choice of the Council and\r\n     Assembly, is 'an old rogue, who gave his assent to the Federal\r\n     Constitution merely to avoid refunding money he had purloined from\r\n     the United States.' There is, indeed, a good deal of man's\r\n     inconsistency in all this, and yet a stranger, seeing it in our own\r\n     prints, though he does not believe it all, may probably believe\r\n     enough of it to conclude that Pennsylvania is peopled by a set of\r\n     the most unprincipled, wicked, rascally, and quarrelsome scoundrels\r\n     upon the face of the globe. I have sometimes, indeed, suspected\r\n     that those papers are the manufacture of foreigners among you, who\r\n     write with the view of disgracing your country, and making you\r\n     appear contemptible and detestable all the world over; but then I\r\n     wonder at the indiscretion of your printers in publishing such\r\n     writings. There is, however, one of your inconsistencies that\r\n     consoles me a little, which is that though, living, you give one\r\n     another the character of devils, dead, you are all angels. It is\r\n     delightful, when any of you die, to read what good husbands, good\r\n     fathers, good friends, good citizens, and good Christians you were,\r\n     concluding with a scrap of poetry that places you with certainty in\r\n     heaven. So that I think Pennsylvania a good country to die in,\r\n     though a very bad one to live in.'\r\n\r\nThese remarks, which Franklin makes with such powerful irony, might\r\napply with equal force to a similar period in the newspaper history of\r\nany country, and most of all to that of England.\r\n\r\nThe worst features, perhaps, of these writers of _Mercuries_, were the\r\nreadiness with which they apostatized, and the systematic and unblushing\r\nmanner in which they sold their pens to the highest bidder, and\r\nprostituted the press to serve the purposes of their patrons. Mrs.\r\nHutchinson, in the memoirs of her husband, Colonel Hutchinson, gives a\r\ncurious instance of their venality:\r\n\r\n     'Sir John Gell, of Derbyshire, kept the diurnall makers in pension,\r\n     soe that whatever was done in the neighboring counties against the\r\n     enemy, was attributed to him, and thus he hath indirectly purchased\r\n     himself a name in story which he never merited. That which made his\r\n     courage the more questioned was the care he tooke and the expense\r\n     he was att to get it weekly mentioned in the diurnalls, so that\r\n     when they had nothing else to renoune him for, they once put it\r\n     that the troops of that valiant commander Sir John Gell tooke a\r\n     dragoon with a plush doublet.... Mr. Hutchinson, on the other side,\r\n     that did well for virtue's sake, and not for the vaine glory of it,\r\n     never would give aniething to buy the flatteries of those\r\n     scribblers; and, when one of them once, while he was in towne, made\r\n     mention of something done at Nottingham, with falsehood, and had\r\n     given Gell the glory of an action in which he was not concerned,\r\n     Mr. Hutchinson rebuked him for it; whereupon the man begged his\r\n     pardon, and told him he would write as much for him the next weeke;\r\n     but Mr. Hutchinson told him he scorned his mercenary pen, and\r\n     warned him not to dare to be in any of his concernments; whereupon\r\n     the fellow was awed, and he had no more abuse of that kind.'\r\n\r\nThe _Mercuries_, however, were not allowed to have everything their own\r\nway without any interference on the part of the powers that were. In\r\n1647, Sir Thomas Fairfax called the attention of the House of Lords, by\r\nletter, to the great number of unlicensed newspapers, with a view to\r\ntheir suppression; but he adds, in mitigation of his attack:\r\n\r\n     'That the kingdom's expectation may be satisfied in relation to\r\n     intelligence till a firm peace be settled, considering the\r\n     mischiefs that will happen by the poisonous writings of evil men\r\n     sent abroad daily to abuse and deceive the people, that if the\r\n     House shall see it fit, some two or three sheets may be permitted\r\n     to come forth weekly, which may be licensed, and have some stamp of\r\n     authoritie with them, and in respect of the former licenser, Mr.\r\n     Mabbot, hath approved himself faithful in that service of\r\n     licensing, and likewise in the service of the House and of this\r\n     army, I humbly desire that he may be restored and continued in the\r\n     same place of licenser.'\r\n\r\nThe result of this letter--which is remarkable, by the way, for its\r\nmention of the licenser--was that the House of Lords issued an edict to\r\nforbid any such publications except with the license of one or both\r\nHouses of Parliament, and with the name of the author, printer, and\r\nlicenser attached. The penalties for any evasion of this enactment were,\r\nfor the writer, a fine of forty shillings or imprisonment for forty\r\ndays; for the printer, half that punishment, and the destruction of his\r\npress and plant as well, and for the vendor a sound whipping and the\r\nconfiscation of his wares. A second instance of parliamentary\r\ninterference took place in the same year, when a committee was appointed\r\nfor the purpose of discovering and punishing every one connected with\r\nthe publication of certain _Mercuries_. The licensing system continued\r\nin force, but was not made much use of, although the scurrilities of the\r\npress roused the Parliament every now and then into spasmodic efforts of\r\nrepression. In addition to measures of this kind, Nedham's paper, from\r\nits official character, was doubtless looked upon by the legislature as\r\na sort of antidote to the poison diffused by other journalists. This\r\ncame out twice a week, on Mondays under the name of _The Public\r\nIntelligencer_, and on Thursdays under that of _Mercurius Politicus_.\r\nWhen Nedham fell into disgrace at the Restoration, his paper was placed\r\nby Parliament in other hands, and the Monday title changed to that of\r\n_The Parliamentary Intelligencer_, though that of the Thursday's issue\r\nremained unaltered. The powers of the licenser were now much more\r\nstrictly exercised, and the _Mercuries_ gave up the ghost in shoals. In\r\n1662 an act was passed 'for preventing the frequent abuses in printing\r\nseditious, treasonable, and unlicensed books and pamphlets, and for\r\nregulating of printing and printing presses.' It also divided the duties\r\nof the licenser, and the supervision of newspapers passed into the hands\r\nof the Secretary of State. Ireland was not slow to follow England's\r\nexample, for, in Lord Mountmorris's 'History of the Irish Parliament,'\r\nmention is made in 1662 'of a very extraordinary question' which 'arose\r\nabout preventing the publication of the debates of the Irish Parliament\r\nin an English newspaper called _The Intelligencer_, and a letter was\r\nwritten from the Speaker to Sir Edward Nicholas, the English Secretary\r\nof State, to prevent these publications in those diurnalls, as they call\r\nthem.' In 1661, _The Parliamentary Intelligencer_ was turned into _The\r\nKingdom's Intelligencer_, and this last appellation was again changed\r\nfor that of _The Public Intelligencer_ in 1663. The celebrated Roger\r\nL'Estrange, who was then the public licenser, was the editor of this\r\npaper, as also of an extra Thursday issue called _The News_. In the\r\nfirst number of this old friend with a new face, he says, among other\r\npros and cons as to the desirability of a newspaper:\r\n\r\n     'Supposing the press in order, the people in their right wits, and\r\n     news or no news to be the question, a public _Mercury_ should never\r\n     have my vote, because I think it makes the multitude too familiar\r\n     with the actions and counsels of their superiors, too pragmatical\r\n     and censorious, and gives them not only an itch, but a kind of\r\n     colorable right and license.... A gazette is none of the worst ways\r\n     of address to the genius and humor of the common people, whose\r\n     affections are much more capable of being turned and wrought upon\r\n     by convenient hints and touches in the shape and air of a pamphlet\r\n     than by the strongest reason and best notions imaginable under any\r\n     other and more sober form whatsoever.... So that upon the main I\r\n     perceive the thing requisite (for aught I can see yet). Once a week\r\n     may do the business, for I intend to utter my news by weight, not\r\n     by measure. Yet if I shall find, when my hand is in, and after the\r\n     planting and securing of my correspondents, that the matter will\r\n     fairly furnish more, without either uncertainty, repetition, or\r\n     impertinence, I shall keep myself free to double at pleasure. One\r\n     book a week may be expected, however, to be published every\r\n     Thursday, and finished upon the Tuesday night, leaving Wednesday\r\n     entire for the printing of it.'\r\n\r\nThe Newspaper was evidently developing itself--correspondents were a new\r\nfeature--but still it was very tardy and very far from being free. Fancy\r\na newspaper in the present day with no news more recent than that of the\r\nday before yesterday! In 1663 the title of _Public Intelligencer_ was\r\nexchanged for that of _The Oxford Gazette_, so called because the court\r\nhad gone to Oxford on account of the plague. After the court's return to\r\nthe metropolis, _London_ was substituted, in 1666, for _Oxford_, and\r\nfrom that date to the present this, the first official or semi-official\r\norgan, has gone by the name of _The London Gazette_. The king caused an\r\nedition of it to be published in French, for the convenience, probably,\r\nof his accommodating banker, Louis the Fourteenth, and this edition\r\ncontinued to appear for about twenty years.\r\n\r\nCharles the Second was an unsparing and unscrupulous foe to the press,\r\nand put in practice every possible form of oppression in order to crush\r\nit. One's blood boils at the perusal of the persecutions to which the\r\nstruggling apostles of freedom of speech were subjected, so that the\r\ncontempt which this miserable 'king of shreds and patches' inspires in\r\nother respects wellnigh changes into positive hatred. But despite of\r\nfine and imprisonment, scourge and pillory, the press toiled on steadily\r\ntoward its glorious goal. The Newspaper began to assume--as far as its\r\ncontents were concerned--the appearance which it wears at the present\r\nday. Straggling advertisements had long ago appeared, the first on\r\nrecord being one offering a reward for the recovery of two horses that\r\nhad been stolen. This appeared in the first number of the _Impartial\r\nIntelligencer_, in 1648. Booksellers and the proprietors of quack\r\nmedicines were among the earliest persons to discover the advantages of\r\nadvertising, and in 1657 came out the _Public Advertiser_, which\r\nconsisted almost entirely of advertisements. The following curious\r\nnotification appeared in the _Mercurius Politicus_, of September 30,\r\n1658:\r\n\r\n     'That excellent and by all Physicians approved _China_ Drink,\r\n     called by the _Chineans, Tcha_, by other Nations _Tay_, alias\r\n     _Tee_, is sold at the _Sultaness' Head Cophee House_, in\r\n     _Sweeting's_ Rents, by the Royal Exchange, _London_.'\r\n\r\nThe earliest illustrated paper is _Mercurius Civicus, London's\r\nIntelligencer_, in 1643. The first commercial newspaper was a venture of\r\nL'Estrange's in 1675, and was styled _The City Mercury, or\r\nAdvertisements concerning Trade_. The first literary paper issued from\r\nthe press in 1680, under the denomination of _Mercurius Librarius, or a\r\nFaithful Account of all Books and Pamphlets_. The first sporting paper\r\nwas _The Jockey's Intelligencer, or Weekly Advertisements of Horses and\r\nSecond-hand Coaches to be Bought or Sold_, in 1683. The first medical\r\npaper, _Observations on the Weekly Bill, from July 27 to August 3, with\r\nDirections how to avoid the Dis eases now prevalent_, came out in 1686;\r\nand the first comic newspaper, _The Merrie Mercury_, in 1700.\r\nNotwithstanding these 'first appearances on any stage,' there never was\r\na darker or more dismal period in the history of journalism. A great\r\nnumber of newspapers had sprung up in consequence of the Popish Plot,\r\nand the exclusion of the Duke of York--the respectable admiralty clerk\r\nof Macaulay--from the throne; and with the intention of sweeping these\r\naway, a royal 'proclamation for suppressing the printing and publishing\r\nunlicensed news books and pamphlets of news' was put forth in 1680.\r\nVigorous action against recalcitrants followed, and with such pliant\r\ntools as those perjured wretches, Scroggs and Jeffreys, for judge and\r\nprosecutor, convictions and the 'extremest punishment of the law' became\r\na foregone conclusion. Doubtless there were many vile scribblers who\r\ndeserved to have the severest penalties inflicted upon them, but no\r\ndiscrimination was used, and good and bad alike experienced the\r\nvengeance of 'divine right.' The aim of the abandoned monarch and his\r\nadvisers was manifestly total extermination, and journalism appeared to\r\nbe at its last gasp. But though crushed and mutilated in every limb, and\r\nbleeding at every pore, faint respirations every now and then showed\r\nthat the vital spark still lingered. But brighter days were at hand.\r\nThat festering mass of mental and bodily corruption which had once worn\r\na crown, was buried away out of the sight of indignant humanity, and the\r\nvacillating James with feeble steps mounted the tottering throne. The\r\nlicensing act had expired in 1679, and had not been again renewed, for\r\nthere were no newspapers to license. Upon the alarm of Monmouth's\r\ninvasion, James renewed it temporarily for seven years. Journalism\r\nreared its head again, and the court party, instead of persecuting,\r\nfound itself compelled to fawn and flatter and sue for its protection\r\nand support. Newspapers, both native and imported from Holland in large\r\nnumbers, played an important part in the Revolution, and paved the way\r\nfor the downfall of the Stuarts and the advent of William and the\r\nProtestant Succession.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that the capital had possessed a monopoly of\r\nnewspapers during all this period. Scotland appeared in the field with a\r\n_Mercurius Politicus_, published at Leith in 1653. This, however, was\r\nnothing but a reprint of a London news sheet, and probably owed its\r\nexistence to the presence of Cromwell's soldiers. In 1654 it removed to\r\nEdinburgh, and in 1660 changed its denomination to _Mercurius Publicus_.\r\nOn the last day of this year, too, a journal of native growth budded\r\nforth, with the title of _Mercurius Caledonius_. But the canny Scots\r\neither could not or would not spare their bawbees for the encouragement\r\nof such ephemeral literature, for Chalmers tells us that only ten\r\nnumbers of this publication appeared, and they were 'very loyal, very\r\nilliterate, and very affected.' Dublin appears to have produced a\r\n_Dublin News Letter_ in 1685, but little is known about it, and its very\r\nexistence has been disputed. There were other sheets with Scotch and\r\nIrish titles, but they were all printed in London. With 1688 a new era\r\ndawned upon the press--the most promising it had yet seen--and\r\nnewspapers gradually sprang up all over the kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe first that came out in the interests of the new Government were the\r\n_Orange Intelligencer_ and the _Orange Gazette_. The opponents of the\r\nministry also started organs of their own, and the paper warfare went\r\ngayly on, but with more decency and courtesy than heretofore. William\r\ndid not show himself disposed to hamper the press in any way, but\r\nParliament, in 1694, proved its hostility by an ordinance 'that no\r\nnews-letter writers do, in their letters or other papers that they\r\ndisperse, presume to intermeddle with the debates or other proceedings\r\nof this House.' This was only a momentary ebullition of spleen. The\r\nlicensing act, which expired in 1692, had been renewed for one year,\r\nbut at the end of that period disappeared forever from English\r\nlegislation. The House of Lords--obstructive as usual to all real\r\nprogress--endeavored to revive it, but the Commons refused their\r\nconsent, and a second attempt in 1697 met with a like defeat. This\r\nobstacle being happily got rid of, new journals of all kinds arose every\r\nday. One was called _The Ladies' Mercury_; a second, _The London\r\nMercury_, _or_ _Mercure de Londres_, and was printed in parallel English\r\nand French columns. A third was entitled _Mercurios Reformatus_, and\r\nwas, during a portion of its existence, edited by the famous Bishop\r\nBurnet. Some were half written and half printed. One of these, the\r\n_Flying Post_, in 1695, says in its prospectus:\r\n\r\n     'If any gentleman has a mind to oblige his country friend or\r\n     correspondent with this account of public affairs, he may have it\r\n     for twopence of J. Salisbury, at the Rising Sun, in Cornhill, on a\r\n     sheet of fine paper, half of which being blank, he may thereon\r\n     write his own private business, or the material news of the day.'\r\n\r\nIn 1696, Dawks's _News Letter_ appeared, printed in a sort of running\r\ntype, to imitate handwriting, with the following quaint announcement:\r\n\r\n     'This letter will be done upon good writing paper, and blank space\r\n     left, that any gentleman may write his own private business. It\r\n     does, undoubtedly, exceed the best of the written news, contains\r\n     double the quantity, with abundant more ease and pleasure, and will\r\n     be useful to improve the younger sort in writing a curious hand.'\r\n\r\nVarious authors, whose names will always find a lofty place in\r\nliterature, contributed to the newspapers of this epoch, and among them\r\nwe find those of South, Wesley, Sir William Temple, and Swift. The\r\nadvertisements by this time had become as varied as they are nowadays,\r\nand were without doubt almost as important a part of the revenue of a\r\nnewspaper. An amusing proof of this is to be found in the _Collection\r\nfor the Improvement of Husbandry and Trade_, in which the editor\r\ndisplays a lively interest in this department of his paper, by employing\r\nthe first person, thus: 'I want a cook maid for a merchant,' 'I want an\r\napprentice for a tallow chandler,' etc., etc. He also advertises that he\r\nknows of several men and women who wish to find spouses, and he\r\nundertakes match making in all honor and secrecy. He tells us that he\r\nhas a house for sale, and wishes to buy a shop, an estate, a complete\r\nset of manuscript sermons, and a government situation. Other editors\r\nbear witness to the character of their advertisers, and recommend\r\ndoctors, undertakers, waiting maids, footmen, and various tradesmen.\r\nSome of the advertisements are very funny. 'I want a compleat young man\r\nthat will wear a livery, to wait on a very, valuable gentleman, but he\r\nmust know how to play on a violin or flute.' Was the 'very valuable\r\ngentleman,' we wonder, troubled like Saul with an evil spirit, that\r\ncould be exorcised by music? Tastes certainly differ, for this\r\nadvertisement reminds us of a venerable old lady of our acquaintance,\r\nwho was kept in a chronic state of irritation by a favorite footman,\r\nwhom she did not choose to discharge, through his learning the flute and\r\npersisting in practising 'Away with melancholy'--the only tune he\r\nknew--for an hour daily! But to return to the advertisements. A\r\nschoolmaster announces that he 'has had such success with boys, as there\r\nare almost forty ministers and schoolmasters that were his scholars. His\r\nwife also teaches girls lace making, plain work, raising paste, sauces,\r\nand cookery to a degree of exactness'--departments of education which\r\nare, unfortunately, too much lost sight of in modern 'Establishments for\r\nYoung Ladies,' 'His price is £10 to £11 the year; with a pair of sheets\r\nand one spoon, to be returned if desired.'\r\n\r\nDuring the whole reign of William there was not a single newspaper\r\nprosecution, but there were many in that of 'the good Queen Anne.' Still\r\neditors were obliged to be very careful in the wording of their items of\r\nnews, generally prefacing them with 'We hear,' 'It is said,' 'It is\r\nreported,' 'They continue to say,' ''Tis believed,' and so on. Of the\r\nchief newspapers of this period we get the following account from John\r\nDunton, who was joint proprietor with Samuel Wesley of the _Athenian\r\nMercury_:\r\n\r\n     'The _Observator_ is best to towel the Jacks, the _Review_ is best\r\n     to promote peace, the _Flying Post_ is best for the Scotch news,\r\n     the _Postboy_ is best for the English and Spanish news, the _Daily\r\n     Courant_ is the best critic, the _English Post_ is the best\r\n     collector, the _London Gazette_ has the best authority, and the\r\n     _Postman_ is the best for everything.'\r\n\r\nThe _Daily Courant_, which was the first daily newspaper, first appeared\r\non the 11th of March, 1702. It was but a puny affair of two columns,\r\nprinted on one side of the sheet only, and consisted, like most of the\r\njournals of the time, mainly of foreign intelligence. It lasted until\r\n1735, when it was merged in the _Daily Gazetteer_. In spite of\r\nprosecutions for libel, the press throve, and, perhaps, to a certain\r\nextent, on that very account greatly improved in character. Addison,\r\nSteele, Bolingbroke, Manwaring, Prior, Swift, Defoe, and other\r\ncelebrities became editors or contributors, and a battle royal was waged\r\namong them in the _Examiner_, the _Whig Examiner_, the _Observator_, the\r\n_Postboy_, the _Review_, the _Medley_, and other papers of less note.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile newspapers began to appear in the provinces. The earliest was\r\nthe _Stamford Mercury_--a title preserved to the present day--which came\r\nout in 1695. Norwich started a journal of its own, the _Norwich\r\nPostman_, in 1706, the price of which the proprietors stated to be 'one\r\npenny, but a half penny not refused.' The _Worcester Postman_ made its\r\nbow in 1708, and Berrow's _Worcester Journal_--which still exists--in\r\n1709. Newcastle followed suite with its _Courant_, in 1711, and\r\nLiverpool with its _Courant_ in 1712. The other large towns did the same\r\nat less or greater intervals, and of the provincial journals which were\r\nborn in the first half of the eighteenth century about a score still\r\nflourish. The _Edinburgh Gazette_ came cut in 1699, as appears from the\r\nfollowing quaint document, which has been republished by the Maitland\r\nClub at the 'modern Athens':\r\n\r\n     'Anent the petition given to the Lords of his Majestie's Privy\r\n     Councill by James Donaldson, merchant in Edinburgh, shewing 'that\r\n     the petitioner doth humbly conceive the publishing ane gazette in\r\n     this place, containeing ane abridgement of fforaigne newes together\r\n     with the occurrences at home, may be both usefull and satisfieing\r\n     to the leidges, and actually hath published on or two to see how it\r\n     may be liked, and so farr as he could understand the project was\r\n     approven of by very many, and, therefore, humbly supplicating the\r\n     said Lords to the effect after mentioned;' the Lords of his\r\n     Majestie's Privy Councill, having considered this petition given in\r\n     to them by the above James Donaldsone, they doe hereby grant full\r\n     warrant and authority to the petitioner for publishing the above\r\n     gazette, and discharges any other persones whatsoever to pen or\r\n     publish the like under the penaltie of forfaulting all the coppies\r\n     to the petitioner, and farder payment to him of the soume of ane\r\n     hundred pounds Scots money, by and altour the forsaid confiscatioun\r\n     and forfaulture; and recommends to the Lord High Chancellor to\r\n     nominat and appoint a particular persone to be supervisor of the\r\n     said gazetts before they be exposed to public view, printed, or\r\n     sold.'\r\n\r\nIn 1705 a rival started up in the _Edinburgh Courant_, which was\r\npublished three times a week. About the same time appeared the _Scots\r\nCourant_, in 1708 the _Edinburgh Flying Post_, and in the following year\r\nthe _Scots Postman_, the two last being tri-weekily. In 1718 there\r\ndawned upon the literary horizon the _Edinburgh Evening Courant_, which\r\nstill continues. It was published _cum privilegio_ on condition that the\r\nproprietor 'should give ane coppie of his print to the magistrates.'\r\nWith regard to Ireland, it is a curious fact that Dublin took the lead\r\nof London in establishing a daily paper, for _Pue's Occurrences_ first\r\nissued in 1700, and survived for more than fifty years. But this effort\r\nappears to have exhausted the newspaper energies of the sister isle, for\r\nwe have no record of any other journal during a quarter of a century.\r\n\r\nContemporary with its extension to the provinces, newspaper enterprise\r\nwas penetrating into the colonies, and America took the lead. Small were\r\nthe beginnings in the land where the freedom of the press was destined\r\nto attain its fullest development. America's first journal--the _Boston\r\nNews Letter_--was printed at Boston in 1704, and survived to the limit\r\nassigned by the Psalmist to the age of man. In 1719 appeared the _Boston\r\nGazette_, and in the same year the _American Weekly Miscellany_, at\r\nPhiladelphia. In 1721 appeared James Franklin's paper, the _New England\r\nCourant_, and in 1728 the _New York Journal_. In 1733 John P. Tenzer\r\nbrought out the _New York Weekly Journal_, a paper which was so ably\r\nconducted in opposition to the Government, that in the following year a\r\nprosecution, or rather persecution, was determined upon. Andrew Hamilton\r\nwas Tenzer's counsel, and the temptation to quote a passage from the\r\nperoration of his speech for the defence is irresistible:\r\n\r\n     'The question which is argued before you this day is not only the\r\n     cause of a poor printer, nor yet even of the colony of New York\r\n     alone: it is the best of causes--the cause of liberty. Every man\r\n     who prefers freedom to a life of slavery will bless and honor in\r\n     you the men whose verdict will have secured to us upon a firm\r\n     basis--to us, to our posterity, to our neighbors, that right which\r\n     both nature and the honor of our country gives us, the liberty of\r\n     freely speaking and writing the truth.'\r\n\r\nWhat could the jury do, after these burning words, but acquit the\r\nprisoner? They did acquit him, and from this famous trial dates,\r\naccording to Gouverneur Morris, the dawn of the American Revolution,\r\nwhich myriads of Englishmen, whatever may be thought or said to the\r\ncontrary by persons who wish to raise bad blood between two mighty\r\ncountries, delight to acknowledge as glorious. But the progress of the\r\npress in America was slow under British rule, for in 1775 there were\r\nonly thirty-six journals in the various States altogether. The West\r\nIndia islands soon began to establish papers of their own, and Barbadoes\r\nled the way in 1731 with the _Barbadoes Gazette_. Yet the development of\r\njournalism in other British colonies belongs to a later period of\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nTo return to England. A heavy blow was impending over the fourth estate.\r\nIn 1712 a tax, in the shape of a half-penny stamp, was levied upon each\r\nnewspaper. The reason alleged for this measure was that political\r\npamphlets had so increased in number and virulence that the queen had\r\ncalled the attention of Parliament to them, and had recommended it to\r\nfind a remedy equal to the mischief, and, in one of her messages, had\r\ncomplained that 'by seditious papers and factious rumors, designing men\r\nhave been able to sink credit, and that the innocent have to suffer.' An\r\nact was accordingly passed by which every printer was obliged to lodge\r\none copy of each number of his paper, within six days of its\r\npublication, with a collector appointed for the purpose, and at the same\r\ntime to state the number of sheets, etc., under a penalty of £20 for\r\ndefault. Country printers were allowed fourteen days instead of six.\r\nThis act, as may easily be imagined, spread confusion and dismay in all\r\ndirections. Half-penny and farthing newspapers fell at once before the\r\nfierce onslaught of the red oppressor--a vegetable monstrosity, having\r\nthe rose, shamrock, and thistle growing on a single stalk, surmounted\r\nby the royal crown. All the less important and second-rate journals\r\nwithered away before the deadly breath of the new edict, and a few only\r\nof the best were enabled to continue by raising their price. Addison, in\r\nthe 445th number of the _Spectator_, July 31st, 1712, alludes to this\r\nnew tax as follows:\r\n\r\n     'This is the day on which many eminent authors will probably\r\n     publish their last words. I am afraid that few of our weekly\r\n     historians, who are men that, above all others, delight in war,\r\n     will be able to subsist under the weight of a stamp and an\r\n     approaching peace. A sheet of blank paper that must have this new\r\n     imprimatur clapped upon it before it is qualified to communicate\r\n     anything to the public, will make its way but very heavily.... A\r\n     facetious friend, who loves a pun, calls this present mortality\r\n     among authors 'the fall of the leaf.' I remember upon Mr. Baxter's\r\n     death there was published a sheet of very good sayings, inscribed:\r\n     'The last words of Mr. Baxter.' The title sold so great a number of\r\n     these papers, that, about a week after these, came out a second\r\n     sheet, inscribed: 'More last words of Mr. Baxter.' In the same\r\n     manner I have reason to think that several ingenious writers who\r\n     have taken their leave of the public in farewell papers, will not\r\n     give over so, but intend to appear, though perhaps under another\r\n     form, and with a different title.'\r\n\r\nThis prediction of Addison's was verified, for, after the first year,\r\nthe act was allowed to fall into abeyance, and the scribblers raised\r\ntheir heads once more, and endeavored, by extra diligence and industry,\r\nto make up for their past discomfiture and enforced silence.\r\n\r\nOf the essay papers, as they are called, the _Tatler_ is the only one\r\nwhich properly comes within the scope of this article, as being, to a\r\ncertain extent, a newspaper. Addison wrote in the _Freeholder_, and\r\nSteele in the _Englishman_, both being political journals opposed to the\r\nGovernment. For certain articles in this last, which were declared to be\r\nlibellous, and for a pamphlet, entitled _The Crisis_, which he published\r\nabout the same time, poor 'little Dicky, whose trade it was,' according\r\nto his quondam friend Addison, 'to write pamphlets,' was expelled the\r\nHouse of Commons, despite the support of several influential members,\r\nand the famous declaration of Walpole, who was not then the unscrupulous\r\nminister he afterward became, 'The liberty of the press is unrestrained;\r\nhow then shall a part of the legislature dare to punish that as a crime\r\nwhich is not declared to be so by any law framed by the whole? And why\r\nshould that House be made the instrument of such a detestable purpose?'\r\n\r\nThe newspaper writers had now reached a great pitch of power, and had\r\nbecome formidable to the Government. Prosecutions therefore multiplied;\r\nbut not without reason in many cases. Addison complains over and over\r\nagain of the misdirection of their influence, and says, among other\r\nthings:\r\n\r\n     'Their papers, filled with different party spirit, divide the\r\n     people into different sentiments, who generally consider rather the\r\n     principles than the truth of the news writers.'\r\n\r\nAt no time, probably, in the history of journalism did party feeling run\r\nhigher than at this period. New organs sprang up every day, but were,\r\nfor the most part, very short lived. Among the papers of most note were\r\n_The Weekly Journal_, Mist's _Weekly Journal_, the _London Journal_,\r\n_The Free Briton_, and the _Weekly Gazetteer_. Mist was especially a\r\nstout opponent of the Government, and was consequently always in\r\ntrouble. In 1724 there were printed nineteen first-class journals, of\r\nwhich three were daily, ten tri-weekly--three of them 'half-penny\r\n_Posts_'--and six weekly. News was abundant, and the old plan of leaving\r\nblank spaces or filling up with passages of Scripture--an editor\r\nactually reproduced from week to week the first two books of the\r\nPentateuch--was now abandoned. In 1726 appeared the _Public\r\nAdvertiser_, afterward called the _London Daily Advertiser_, which\r\ndeserves to be remembered as having been the medium through which the\r\nletters of Junius were originally given to the world. In the same year,\r\ntoo, was started _The Craftsman_, one of the ablest political papers\r\nwhich London had yet seen, and of which Bolingbroke was joint editor. It\r\nwas immediately successful, and its circulation soon reached ten or\r\ntwelve thousand. In 1731 a great novelty came out, the _Gentleman's\r\nMagazine_, or _Monthly Intelligencer_, under the proprietorship of\r\nEdward Cave, the printer. The title page contained a woodcut of St.\r\nJohn's Gate, Clerkenwell, which had been in olden times the entrance\r\ngateway to the hospital of St. John of Jerusalem, but was then the\r\nabiding place of Cave's printing press, and upon either side of the\r\nengraving was a list of the titles of metropolitan and provincial\r\nnewspapers. The contents, as announced on the same title page, were: 1.\r\nEssays, controversial, humorous and satirical, religious, moral, and\r\npolitical, collected chiefly from the public papers; 2. Select pieces of\r\npoetry; 3. A succinct account of the most remarkable transactions and\r\nevents, foreign and domestic; 4. Marriages and deaths, promotions and\r\nbankruptcies; 5. The prices of goods and stocks, and bills of mortality;\r\n6. A register of barks; 7. Observations on gardening. The prospectus\r\nstates:\r\n\r\n     'Our present undertaking, in the first place, is to give monthly a\r\n     view of all the pieces of wit, humor, or intelligence daily offered\r\n     to the public in the newspapers, which of late are so multiplied as\r\n     to render it impossible, unless a man makes it his business, to\r\n     consult them all; and in the next place, we shall join therewith\r\n     some other matters of use or amusement that will be communicated to\r\n     us. Upon calculating the number of newspapers, 'tis found that\r\n     (besides divers written accounts) no less than two hundred half\r\n     sheets _per mensem_ are thrown from the press only in London, and\r\n     about as many printed elsewhere in the three kingdoms, a\r\n     considerable part of which constantly exhibit essays on various\r\n     subjects for entertainment, and all the rest occasionally oblige\r\n     their readers with matter of public concern, communicated to the\r\n     world by persons of capacity, through their means, so that they are\r\n     become the chief channels of amusement and intelligence. But then,\r\n     being only loose papers, uncertainly scattered about, it often\r\n     happens that many things deserving attention contained in them are\r\n     only seen by accident, and others not sufficiently published or\r\n     preserved for universal benefit or information.'\r\n\r\nThe _Magazine_ sets to work upon its self-imposed task by giving a\r\nsummary of the most important articles during the preceding month in the\r\nprincipal London journals, of the ability, scope, and spirit of which we\r\nthus obtain a very fair notion. The _Craftsman_ has the precedence, and\r\namong articles quoted from it are a historical essay upon Queen Bess,\r\nand 'her wisdom in maintaining her prerogative;' a violent political\r\narticle full of personalities, a complaint of the treatment of the\r\n_Craftsman_ by rival journals, and an essay upon the liberty of the\r\npress. The summary of the _London Journal_ seems to show that it was\r\ncontinually occupied in controverting the views and arguments of the\r\n_Craftsman_. _Fog's Journal_ is employed in making war upon the _London\r\nJournal_ and the _Free Briton_. The following specimen does not say much\r\nfor Mr. Fog's satirical powers:\r\n\r\n     'One Caleb D'Anvers' (Nicholas Amherst, of the Craftsman), 'and, if\r\n     I mistake not, one Fog, are accused of seditiously asserting that a\r\n     crow is black; but the writers on the other side have, with\r\n     infinite wit, proved a black crow to be the whitest bird of all the\r\n     feathered tribe.'\r\n\r\nThese old newspapers give us curious glimpses of the manners of the\r\ntime. The _Grub-Street Journal_ has an article upon 'an operation\r\ndesigned to be performed upon one Ray, a condemned malefactor, by Mr.\r\nCheselden, so as to discover whether or no not only the drum but even\r\nthe whole organ be of any use at all in hearing.' The writer must have\r\nbeen an ardent vivisector, for he concludes by a suggestion that 'all\r\nmalefactors should be kept for experiments instead of being hanged.' In\r\nanother number this periodical indulges in a criticism upon the new ode\r\nof the poet laureate (Colley Cibber), in the course of which the writer\r\nexpresses an opinion that 'when a song is good sense, it must be made\r\nnonsense before it is made music; so when a song is nonsense, there is\r\nno other way but by singing it to make it seem tolerable sense'--a\r\ncriticism which, whether it were true of that period or no, may be\r\nfairly said to apply with great force to the times in which we live. The\r\n_Weekly Register_ makes war upon the _Grub-Street Journal_, and, in a\r\nsatirical article upon the title of that newspaper, likens the writers\r\nto caterpillars and grubs, etc., 'deriving their origin from Egyptian\r\nlocusts;' and, in another article, accuses them of 'having undertaken\r\nthe drudgery of invective under pretence of being champions of\r\npoliteness.' The other papers summarized are the _Free Briton_, a\r\nviolent opponent of the _Craftsman_, the _British Journal_, and the\r\n_Universal Spectator_, the forte of the last two lying in essays and\r\ncriticisms.\r\n\r\nBut the grand feature of the _Gentleman's Magazine_ was, that it was the\r\nfirst to systematize parliamentary reporting. This was originally\r\nmanaged by Cave and two or three others obtaining admission to the\r\nstrangers' gallery, and taking notes furtively of the speeches. These\r\nnotes were afterward compared, and from them and memory the speeches\r\nwere reproduced in print. Cave's reports continued for two years\r\nunmolested, when the House of Commons endeavored to put an end to them.\r\nA debate took place, in which all the speakers were agreed except Sir\r\nWilliam Wyndham, who expressed a timid dissent, as follows: 'I don't\r\nknow but what the people have a right to know what their representatives\r\nare doing.' 'I don't know,' forsooth--the Government and the people must\r\nhave been a long way off then from a proper appreciation of the duties\r\nof the one and the rights of the other! Sir Robert Walpole, the former\r\nfriend of the press--who, by the way, is said to have spent more than\r\n£50,000 in bribes to venal scribblers in the course of ten years--had\r\ncompletely changed his views, and had nothing then to say in its favor.\r\nA resolution was passed which declared it breach of privilege to print\r\nany of the debates, and announced the intention of the House to punish\r\nwith the utmost severity any offenders. Cave, however, was not easily\r\ndaunted, and, instead of publishing the speeches with the first and last\r\nletters of the names of the speakers, he adopted this expedient: he\r\nanagrammatized the names, and published the debates in what purported to\r\nbe 'An Appendix to Captain Lemuel Gulliver's Account of the Famous\r\nEmpire of Lilliput, giving the Debates in the Senate of Great Lilliput.'\r\nThis system was continued for nine years, but, after an interval, Cave\r\nreverted to the old plan. He had always employed some writer or other of\r\nknown ability to write the speeches from his notes, and generally even\r\nwithout any notes at all, so that the speeches were often purely\r\nimaginary. In 1740 Dr. Johnson was employed for this purpose, and he,\r\naccording to his own confession, had been but once inside the walls of\r\nthe Parliament. Murphy tells the story and gives the names of the\r\npersons who were present when he made the avowal. It occurred thus: A\r\ncertain speech of Pitt's, which had appeared in the _Gentleman's\r\nMagazine_, was being highly praised by the company, when Johnson\r\nstartled every one by saying: 'That speech I wrote in a garret in Exeter\r\nstreet.' He then proceeded to give an account of the manner in which the\r\nwhole affair used to be managed--this happened many years after his\r\nconnection with the matter had ceased--and the assembly 'lavished\r\nencomiums' upon him, especially for his impartiality, inasmuch as he\r\n'dealt out reason and eloquence with an equal hand to both parties.'\r\nJohnson replied: 'That is not quite true: I saved appearances tolerably\r\nwell, but I took care that the Whig dogs should not have the best of\r\nit.' These speeches were long received by the world as verbatim reports,\r\nand Voltaire is said to have exclaimed, on reading some of them: 'The\r\neloquence of Greece and Rome is revived in the British Senate.' Johnson,\r\nfinding they were so received, felt some prickings of conscience, and\r\ndiscontinued their manufacture. When upon his deathbed, he said that\r\n'the only part of his writings that gave him any compunction was his\r\naccount of the debates in the _Gentleman's Magazine_, but that at the\r\ntime he wrote them he did not think he was imposing upon the world.'\r\nSeveral attempts had been made to checkmate Cave, and in 1747 he was\r\nsummoned before the House of Lords, reprimanded, and fined, but finally\r\ndischarged upon begging pardon of the House, and promising never to\r\noffend again. However, in 1752, he resumed the publication of the\r\ndebates, with this prefatory statement, a statement which must be taken\r\n_cum grano_:\r\n\r\n     'The following heads of speeches in the H---- of C---- were given\r\n     me by a gentleman, who is of opinion that members of Parliament are\r\n     accountable to their constituents for what they say as well as what\r\n     they do in their legislative capacity; that no honest man, who is\r\n     entrusted with the liberties and purses of the people, will ever be\r\n     unwilling to have his whole conduct laid before those who so\r\n     entrusted him, without disguise; that if every gentleman acted upon\r\n     this just, this honorable, this constitutional principle, the\r\n     electors themselves only would be to blame if they reflected a\r\n     person guilty of a breach of so important a trust.'\r\n\r\nCave continued his reports in a very condensed form until he died, in\r\n1754, and left his system as a legacy to his successors and imitators.\r\nHe was the father of parliamentary reporting, and it is for this reason\r\nmore especially that his name deserves to be remembered with gratitude\r\nby all well wishers to the freedom of the press, which is the liberty of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TREASURY REPORT AND MR. SECRETARY CHASE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe military condition at the present time is highly encouraging; but\r\nour armies have not always been successful in the field, and many of our\r\ncampaigns have ended either in disaster or without decisive results. The\r\nnavy, though it has achieved much in some quarters, has not altogether\r\nanswered to the reasonable expectations of the country or to the vast\r\nsums which have been expended to make it powerful and efficient. Our\r\nforeign relations, during the war, have sometimes assumed a threatening\r\naspect, and, it must be confessed, have not always been managed with the\r\nskill and firmness due to our prominent position among the nations of\r\nthe world. But there is at least one department of the Government whose\r\ngeneral operations during all these vicissitudes have been the subject\r\nof just pride to the American people. In the midst of great\r\ndifficulties, sufficient to appal and disconcert any ordinary mind, our\r\nstupendous fiscal affairs have been conducted with unrivalled firmness,\r\nability, and success. All our military and naval operations, and indeed\r\nour whole national strength at home and abroad, have necessarily been in\r\na large degree contingent upon the public credit, and this has remained\r\nsolid and unmoved except to gain strength, in spite of all the\r\ndisasters of the war on the land and on the water. The recent annual\r\nreport of Mr. Chase, though chiefly confined to a simple statement of\r\nfacts and figures, is like the account of some great victorious\r\ncampaign, submitted by the unassuming officer who conducted it. The\r\nachievements of the Treasury are in fact the greatest of all our\r\nvictories; they underlie and sustain the prowess of our armies, while\r\nthey signalize the confidence and the patriotism of our whole people.\r\nWithout them the peril of the Union would have been infinitely enhanced,\r\nand perhaps it would have been wholly impossible to conquer the\r\nrebellion. There was a narrow and difficult path to tread in order to\r\navoid national bankruptcy; it was necessary within three years to raise\r\nfifteen hundred millions of dollars, and a single false step might have\r\ndoubled or trebled the amount even of that enormous demand. How often\r\nhas intelligent patriotism trembled to think that the failure of our\r\nfinances would involve the probable futility of our sacred war for the\r\nUnion, with all its tremendous sacrifices of life and property!\r\n\r\nNobly have the people sustained their Government; with a wise instinct\r\nof confidence, they have freely risked their money, as their lives, in\r\nsupport of their own holy cause. This confidence at home has given us\r\nunbounded strength abroad. Nor do the facts in the least diminish the\r\ncredit fairly due to the Secretary, whose great merit is to have\r\norganized a system so well calculated to attract the confidence of the\r\npeople and to inspire them with a sense of perfect security in trusting\r\ntheir fortunes to the keeping of the nation for its help and support in\r\nthe hour of supreme peril. It is the highest evidence of wise\r\nstatesmanship to be able thus to arouse a nation to the cheerful\r\nperformance even of its obvious duty: this has been accomplished by Mr.\r\nChase, under the embarrassment of repeated failures on the part of those\r\nwho had in special charge to defend and promote our noble cause. The\r\nentire merit of this grand success can only be adequately estimated by\r\nconsidering how slight a mistake of judgment or want of faithful courage\r\nin conducting these momentous affairs would have thrown our finances\r\ninto inextricable confusion. Our own experience immediately before the\r\nwar, when there was no adequate conception of the extent of the trouble\r\nabout to come upon us, shows how easily the public credit may be shaken\r\nor destroyed by incompetent or dishonest agents. In spite of envious\r\ndetraction and interested opposition, these great and successful labors\r\nof the Secretary will remain an imperishable monument of his ability to\r\nconduct the most intricate affairs of government, in times of the most\r\nappalling danger and difficulty. He has undergone the severest tests to\r\nwhich a statesman was ever subjected; his genius and his great moral\r\nfirmness have brought him out triumphant.\r\n\r\nThere are a few prominent points in the lucid report of the Secretary\r\nwhich constitute the great landmarks of his system. Adequate taxation\r\nwas of necessity its basis; and, from the very beginning, Mr. Chase\r\ninsisted upon a rigid resort to every available means of raising a\r\nrevenue sufficient to strengthen the hands of the Government, and\r\nsustain its credit through all the vast operations which it was\r\ncompelled to undertake. And now by reference to the actual figures, and\r\nby an analysis of the facts embodied in them, the Secretary shows that\r\nsince the first year of the war, the taxes collected have paid all the\r\nordinary peace expenditures together with the interest on the whole\r\npublic debt, and beyond this have yielded a surplus which, had the war\r\nended, might have been applied to the reduction of the debt. This sound\r\nand indispensable principle, beset with so many temptations and\r\ndifficulties in time of civil commotion, is the very soul of the public\r\ncredit; and the fearlessness with which the Secretary meets the\r\ncontingency of prolonged war and the necessity of additional taxes,\r\nevinces his determination to strengthen and sustain the principle,\r\nrather than to abandon it under any possible circumstances. The enormous\r\nloans already so advantageously obtained, to say nothing of those\r\nadditional ones which will probably be indispensable, could not have\r\nbeen negotiated on any reasonable terms without a firm adherence to this\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nThat part of Mr. Chase's financial system which is most questionable,\r\nand which affords his assailants a fulcrum for their attacks, is its\r\ninterference with the State banks and with the currency which they have\r\nbeen supplying to the country. The issuance of Treasury notes in the\r\nform of a circulating medium, and with the qualities of a legal tender,\r\nhas revolutionized the whole currency and exchanges of the country, and\r\nhas given universal satisfaction to the people. But this popular\r\njudgment is by no means an unerring test of the wisdom or safety of such\r\na measure. Its necessity, however, and its eminent success will forever\r\nstamp it as an expedient of great usefulness and value, especially as\r\nthe Secretary has most judiciously arrested the system at that point\r\nwhere its unquestionable advantages still outweigh its acknowledged\r\ndangers and inconveniences. He informs us that these issues 'were wanted\r\nto fill the vacuum caused by the disappearance of coin, and to supply\r\nthe additional demands created by the increased number and variety of\r\npayments;' and he adds: 'Congress believed that four hundred millions\r\nwould suffice for these purposes, and therefore limited issues to that\r\nsum. The Secretary proposes no change of this limitation and places no\r\nreliance therefore on any increase of resources from increase of\r\ncirculation. Additional loans in this mode would indeed almost certainly\r\nprove illusory; for diminished value could hardly fail to neutralize\r\nincreased amount.'\r\n\r\nIn consequence of these issues, the average rate of interest on the\r\nwhole public debt on the 1st of July last, was only 3.77 per centum, and\r\non the 1st of October, 3.95 per centum.\r\n\r\nIt was to be expected that the banks, which have heretofore had an\r\nentire monopoly of the paper circulation, and of the large profits\r\nderived from its legitimate use, as well as from its disastrous and\r\nsometimes dishonest irregularities, would not very cordially receive the\r\nsystem which is destined to supersede their present organization\r\nentirely. The Secretary justly exults in the advantages of the sound and\r\nuniform circulation which he has afforded in all parts of the country.\r\nAnd as to the depreciation of the Treasury notes in comparison with\r\ngold, he reasons, with great force and truth, that the greater part of\r\nit is attributable to 'the large amount of bank notes yet in\r\ncirculation,' remarking at the same time, that 'were these notes\r\nwithdrawn from use, that much of the now very considerable difference\r\nbetween coin and United States notes would disappear.' Whether this\r\nbelief of the Secretary be well founded or not, nothing can be more\r\ncertain than the superiority of the Treasury notes to those of the mass\r\nof suspended banks, as they would have been after three years of the\r\npresent war. It is frightful to think of the condition to which the\r\ncurrency would have been reduced at this time, if the Government had\r\nbeen guilty of the folly of conducting its immense operations in the\r\nsuspended paper of irresponsible local banks. No one can doubt that the\r\nTreasury notes have been of immense service to the nation in its hour of\r\ntrial; and if the limitation proposed by the Secretary shall be\r\nfaithfully maintained, there need not be the slightest fear of any\r\ndifficulty or discredit in the future. Upon the return of peace the\r\nwhole issue will be easily absorbed and redeemed, either by the process\r\nof funding, or more gradually in the ordinary transactions of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nOn a kindred subject, that of the high prices at present prevailing, let\r\nMr. Chase speak for himself. This statement is so direct and pertinent\r\nthat nothing could well be added. He says:\r\n\r\n     'It is an error to suppose that the increase of prices is\r\n     attributable wholly or in very large measure to this circulation.\r\n     Had it been possible to borrow coin enough, and fast enough, for\r\n     the disbursements of the war, almost if not altogether the same\r\n     effects on prices would have been wrought. Such disbursements made\r\n     in coin would have enriched fortunate contractors, stimulated\r\n     lavish expenditures, and so inflated prices in the same way and\r\n     nearly to the same extent as when made in notes. Prices, too, would\r\n     have risen from other causes. The withdrawal from mechanical and\r\n     agricultural occupations of hundreds of thousands of our best,\r\n     strongest, and most active workers, in obedience to their country's\r\n     summons to the field, would, under any system of currency, have\r\n     increased the price of labor, and, by consequence, the price of the\r\n     products of labor,' &c.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to deny the force of this statement; and upon the whole\r\nwe must acknowledge that most of the evils which have been attributed to\r\nthe financial policy of the Government were inherent in the very nature\r\nof the situation, and would have developed themselves, more or less,\r\nunder any system which could have been adopted. It is very obvious that\r\nthey might have been greatly aggravated by slight changes; but it is not\r\neasy to see how they could have been more skilfully met and parried than\r\nby the measures which have actually yielded such brilliant results.\r\n\r\nThe most signal triumph of Mr. Chase's whole system of finance is to be\r\nfound in the truly marvellous success of his favorite five-twenty bonds.\r\nEven at the present time the public enthusiasm for these securities\r\nseems to be unabated, and it is more than probable that the whole amount\r\nauthorized to be issued will be taken up quite as rapidly as the bonds\r\ncan be prepared or as the money may be required.\r\n\r\nNot without good reason does the Secretary attribute the 'faith' thus\r\nshown by the people 'in the securities of the Government,' to his\r\nnational banking law and the prospective establishment of a currency\r\n'secured by a pledge of national bonds,' and destined at no distant day\r\nto 'take the place of the heterogeneous corporate currency which has\r\nhitherto filled the channels of circulation.' The idea of thus making\r\ntributary to the Government in its present emergency the whole banking\r\ncapital of the country, or at least so much of it as may be employed in\r\nfurnishing a paper circulation for commercial transactions, was as bold\r\nand magnificent as it has proved successful. Nothing less than the\r\nnational credit is sufficiently solid and enduring to be the basis of a\r\npaper currency throughout the vast extent of our country. It is\r\neminently fit that this perfect solidarity of the central government\r\nwith those who furnish paper money for the people of every locality,\r\nshould be required and maintained on a proper basis. But the currency\r\nthus provided is not liable to any of the objections properly urged\r\nagainst a paper circulation issued by the Government itself; it is\r\nissued by individuals or companies, and secured only by such national\r\nstocks as have been created in the necessary operations of the nation\r\nitself. The system does not constitute a national bank or banks in the\r\nsense of that term as heretofore used in our history. It does nothing\r\nmore than assume that indispensable control over the long-neglected\r\ncurrency of the country which is at once the privilege and the duty of\r\nthe National Government. It has authority to pronounce the supreme law\r\namong all the States; and if there be any subject of legislation\r\nrequiring the unity to be derived from the exercise of such authority,\r\nit is, above everything else, that common medium of exchange which\r\nmeasures and regulates the countless daily commercial transactions of\r\nour immense territory. The system involves no participation by the\r\nGovernment in any banking operations; no partnership in any possible\r\nspeculations, great or small; no interference, direct or indirect, with\r\nthe legitimate business of the country: it is only a wise and efficient\r\ndevice, by which the Government assures to the people the soundness of\r\nthe paper which may be imposed upon them for money.\r\n\r\nThe greatest merit of the scheme consists in the fact that it is\r\nintended to supersede that irregular and unsatisfactory system of\r\nbanking which is based on a similar pledge of the credit of the several\r\nStates. It is said to be hostile to the existing banks; but it is only\r\nso in so far as it requires a change of the basis of their credit from\r\nState to National securities. The measure was not conceived in any\r\nunfriendly spirit toward those institutions. It was necessary for the\r\nNational Government to assert its own superiority, and thus to\r\nstrengthen itself, at the same time that it sought to protect the people\r\nby securing them a uniform currency and equable exchanges.\r\n\r\nSome murmurs of opposition have been heard from a quarter well\r\nunderstood; but the good sense of the people, and, we hope, of the\r\nholders of State bonds themselves, seems to have quickly suppressed\r\nthese complaints. A war of the State banks on the Government, at this\r\ntime and on this ground, might well be deplored; but the issue would not\r\nbe doubtful. Mr. Chase occupies the vantage ground, and he would be\r\nvictorious over these, as the country is destined to be over all other\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nAt no other time could so fundamental a change in our system of currency\r\nhave been proposed with the slightest chance of success; and, upon the\r\nwhole, it was a grand and happy conception, in the midst of this\r\ntremendous war, to make its gigantic fiscal necessities contribute to\r\nthe permanent uniformity of the currency and of the domestic exchanges.\r\nFor this great measure is no temporary expedient. Its success is bound\r\nup with the stability of the Government; and if this endures, the good\r\neffects of the new system will be felt and appreciated in future years,\r\nlong after the unhappy convulsion which gave it birth shall have passed\r\naway. It will serve to smooth the path from horrid war to peace, and to\r\nhasten the return of national prosperity; and when experience shall have\r\nfully perfected its organization, it may well be expected, by the\r\ngenerality of its operation and its great momentum, to act as the great\r\nnatural regulator of enterprise and business in our country.\r\n\r\nIf these grand achievements in finance have had so important an\r\ninfluence in sustaining the war for the Union, it is not likely they\r\nwill fail to constitute a large element in controlling the political\r\nevents of the immediate future. Their author is well known to entertain\r\nthe soundest views in reference to the thoroughness of the measures\r\nnecessary to restore harmony in the Union, without being of that extreme\r\nand impracticable school whose policy would render union uncertain or\r\nimpossible; and if a ripe experience in public affairs and the most\r\nbrilliant success in transactions of great delicacy and difficulty, as\r\nwell as of the most vital importance to the triumph of our arms, are of\r\nany value, they cannot be without their due and proper weight in the\r\ncrisis which is fast approaching.\r\n\r\nThe election of next fall will take place under circumstances dangerous\r\nto the stability of our institutions, and trying to the virtue and\r\nwisdom of the American people. We are compelled to undergo that great\r\ntrial, either in the midst of a mighty civil war, or in the confusion\r\nand uncertainty of its recent close, with the legacy of all its\r\ntremendous difficulties to adjust and settle. Even in quiet times, the\r\nPresidential election is an event of deep significance in our political\r\nhistory; but at such times, the ordinary stream of affairs will flow on\r\nquietly in spite of many obstructions; and even the errors and follies\r\nof the people consequent on the intrigues of politicians and the strife\r\nof parties, are not then likely to be fatal to the public security. In\r\nthe midst of the tempest, however, or even in the rough sea, where the\r\nsubsiding winds have left us crippled and exhausted, and far away from\r\nour true course, we have need of all the skill, experience, integrity,\r\nand wisdom which it is possible to call into the service of the country.\r\nBut it is the skill and experience of the statesman, not of the warrior,\r\nwhich the occasion requires. To our great and successful generals, the\r\ngratitude of the people will be unbounded; and it will be exhibited in\r\nevery noble form of expression and action becoming a just and generous\r\nnation. But civil station is not the appropriate reward of military\r\nservices, except in rare cases, when capacity and fitness for its duties\r\nhave been fully established. To conduct a great campaign and to gain\r\nimportant victories is evidence of great ability in achieving physical\r\nresults by the organized agency and force of armies; it does not\r\nnecessarily follow that the great general is an able statesman or a safe\r\ncounsellor in the cabinet or in the legislative assembly. The functions\r\nto be performed in the two cases are wholly dissimilar, if not actually\r\nopposite in nature. War is the reign of force, and is essentially\r\narbitrary in its decisions and violent in its mode of enforcing them:\r\ncivil government, on the other hand, is the embodiment of law, and it\r\nought to be the perfection of reason; its instrumentalities are\r\neminently peaceful and antagonistic to all violence.\r\n\r\nIn times like the present, there is always a tendency to appropriate the\r\npopularity of some great and patriotic soldier, and make it available\r\nfor the promotion of personal or party ends. Success in that sinister\r\npolicy will no doubt often prove to be only an aggravation of ordinary\r\nparty strategy, by which the vital questions of capacity and fitness are\r\nmade subordinate to that of availability. We have in our history too\r\nmany instances of such intrigues and their dangerous consequences, to\r\nadmit of their success at the present time, though they come in the\r\nseductive form of military glory. The degenerate system of party\r\nstrategy culminated seven years ago in the election of James Buchanan.\r\nIn pursuance of the secret and treacherous preparations for the present\r\ninfamous rebellion, the people were ignorantly and blindly led by\r\ncunning intrigue into that fatal mistake; but it was not less the\r\ncircumstances of the tunes and the sinister combination of parties, than\r\nthe weakness and wickedness of the man chosen, which gave him the\r\nimmense power for mischief which he wielded against his country. The\r\ncomplications of the approaching crisis will not be less controlling in\r\ntheir power to bring about the ruin or the restoration of the republic.\r\nIn the uncertain contingencies and possible combinations of opinion and\r\ninterest destined to grow out of the immediate future, no man can\r\nforesee what dangers and difficulties will arise. The only path of\r\nsafety lies in the straight line of consistent action; avoiding sinister\r\nexpedients and untried men; despising the arts of the demagogue, when\r\nthey present themselves in the most specious of all forms, that of using\r\nmilitary success as the pretext for ambitious designs; and doing justice\r\nto the great soldier, _as a soldier_, according to the value of his\r\nachievements, not forgetting that 'peace hath her victories not less\r\nrenowned than those of war,' and that the faithful and able statesman\r\ncannot be overlooked and set aside amid the glare of arms, without\r\ndanger to the best interests of the republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nASPIRO.--A FABLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen my life was like a dream in which we guess at God-thoughts. I was\r\nso completely absorbed in my love that I marked the lapse of time only\r\nby the delicate varyings of my mistress's beauty, or the deepening spell\r\nof her royal rule. I was delirious with the delight of her presence,\r\nwhich comprised to me all types of excellence. Within her eyes the\r\nsapphire gates of heaven unclosed to me; in the splendor of lustred hair\r\nwas life-warmth.\r\n\r\n--And had I forgot?--the red lips I crushed like rose-leaves on my\r\nown--the tender eyes that plead 'remember me'--the faded rosemary which\r\nwe culled together--the vows with which I said that love like ours was\r\nnever false, nor parting fatal. Had I forgot? Could this _Aspiro_ of my\r\nworship quite dispel my youth-dream--had her infatuating presence quite\r\neclipsed my memory of Christine?--\r\n\r\nAlas! I had not meant to be inconstant, but while I strove sullenly for\r\nsuccess in uncongenial occupation, _she_ came to me--Aspiro--came like\r\nthe truth and light, and taught me to myself.\r\n\r\nFor a long time I doubted and resisted; though she tempted me, making\r\nreal the dreams of my shy, worshipful childhood, teaching me the\r\nmeanings of treasured stories which I had listened to from flower-sprite\r\nand river-god, leading and wooing me with lovelier lures than even\r\nNature's; for tropical bird-song and falling water was harsh to her\r\nvoice, and dew-dripped lilies dim to her brow. But I shut my dazzled\r\neyes at first from these, and strove to see only the face whereon, with\r\ntender kisses, I had sealed my future--having narrow aims; till the\r\nvision faded despairingly, and even closed lids would not recall it, and\r\nmy weak resistance seemed but to strengthen the sway that bore me\r\nwillingly away.\r\n\r\nOver and over I told the rosary of Aspiro's charms. Hour by hour I\r\nwearied not of her perfections. With burning vows and rapturous words I\r\npledged my life to her.\r\n\r\nOnce when the wind was sweeping her gay garments, like hope-banners,\r\nagainst my limbs, and tangling her long, loose hair about me--once when\r\nI was blind with the jewel-dazzle from her breast, thrilled by the\r\npassion-pressure of her hand, she said, in saddest, sweetest tones:\r\n\r\n'I am erratic, Paulo, and exacting--will you tire of me!'\r\n\r\nO Immortality! Did not that seem sacrilege!\r\n\r\n\r\nLike curlew's wings flapped the white sails of the ship on the blue\r\nwaters. Aspiro's eyes absorbed my mind and memory. The past was\r\nvoiceless--the future clarion-toned. So we loosed our hold of the real\r\npast, and drifted toward an ideal future.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe wandered through apocalyptic mazes, startling the hush of mystery\r\nwith daring footsteps. We brake the bread of the cosmic sacrament in\r\nsight of the Inaccessible.\r\n\r\nIn the metallic mirrors of Arctic lakes we watched the wind-whipped\r\nclouds. Mute we knelt in the ice-temples of Silence, and where the\r\nglaciers shatter the rainbows we renewed our promises.\r\n\r\nWet sat at the universal banquet, and drank deep of Beauty. Cheek\r\npressed to cheek, arms interlaced, we sighed in the consecrated throes\r\nof its reproduction, and in the imagery of Art we lisped Creation's\r\nlessons.\r\n\r\nFrom height to height and depth to depth. Lagging in low canoes along\r\nthe black waters of silent swamps--life-left--seeing the far-off blue of\r\nsky and hope between the warning points of cypress spires. Across the\r\nstretch of yellow sands, seeking her riddle of the Sphinx, and asking\r\nfrom the Runic records of one dead faith, and the sand-buried temples of\r\nanother, the aim of the True.\r\n\r\nOr clouds or rocks or winds or waves, the mutable or the unchangeable\r\nwas in turn the theme of our reproductive praise. There were\r\ntransfigurations on the mountain tops, where the spirit of the universe\r\nwore shining garbs and hailed us, their Interpreters. From every wave\r\nstretched Undine arms to greet us, and tongues of flame taught us the\r\nglories of the element.\r\n\r\nSometimes in giddy pauses shone sad eyes--yet not reproachful on me; but\r\nif I sighed in answer to their shining, Aspiro dazzled in betwixt me and\r\nmy memory, and bade me 'cease not striving,' while her white finger\r\npointed farther onward. For our love-life was a striving, and life's\r\nbest porcelain was like common clay for fashioning vessels for its use.\r\n\r\nI gave up all to her, time, talent, ingenuity. Studying for her caprices\r\nand struggling for her pleasure. How fair she seemed, how worthy any\r\neffort! If only I might hope that I, at last, should wholly win her\r\napprobation and make our union indissoluble. Her radiant smiles, and\r\nlofty, loving words, were hard to win, but then, when won--! Who ever\r\nlooked and spoke and smiled as did Aspiro?\r\n\r\nThere was neither rest nor dalliance on our way. Unrest lit meteors in\r\nthe heaven of my mistress's eyes, and I lost, at length, the delusion\r\nthat I should ever satisfy all her imperious exactions. Then I hoped to\r\nmake but some one thought or deed quite worthy of her favor, even to the\r\nsacrifice of my life.\r\n\r\nI strove my utmost in the Art we loved. The strife consumed the dross of\r\ndaily, petty hopes and fears, which make the happiness of common lives,\r\nand left my soul a crucible receptive for refinement only; and Aspiro\r\ntempted me to new endeavors by glimpses of the court which Nature holds,\r\nwearing Dalmatian mantle and spray-bright crown, in realms forbidden\r\nmortals.\r\n\r\n'I thought, for my sake,' she would say, sadly,'you had already done\r\nsomething better than you have.'\r\n\r\nIf my soul sickened then, my courage did not falter, nor did her\r\nincentive beauty lose any of its charm.\r\n\r\nI said: 'Give me a task, Aspiro, and I will please you yet.'\r\n\r\nThen she pointed to me what I might do, and my work began.\r\n\r\nIn this work I reproduced my mistress's beauty and my love's\r\nsignificance. Having learned the language of nature, I translated from\r\nher hieroglyphic pages in characters of flame. With rash hands I\r\nstripped false seemings from material beauty, and limned the naked\r\ndivinity of Idea. Shorn by degrees in my strife of youth and strength\r\nand passion, I wound them in my work--toiling like paltry larvæ. And it\r\nwas done--retouched and lingered over long, apotheosized by mighty\r\neffort. So I offered it to my Fate.\r\n\r\nNever before, as at that moment, had Aspiro seemed so worthy to be won\r\nat any cost. I trembled as I laid my work before her--she so transcended\r\nBeauty. But still I hoped. I waited for her dawning smile and\r\noutstretched hand, ready to die of attained longing when these should be\r\nbestowed.\r\n\r\nShe, gleaming like ice, transfixed me coldly, and, slighting with her\r\nglance my work, asked: 'Can you do no more?'\r\n\r\nI answered with weary hopelessness: 'No more.'\r\n\r\nHow cold her laugh was!\r\n\r\n'And have I waited on you all these years for this?'\r\n\r\nI echoed drearily: 'For this.'\r\n\r\n'Well, blot it out, and try again, if you would please me,' said Aspiro.\r\n\r\nWith spent strength I cast myself at her feet.\r\n\r\n'You see,' I said,'I have mixed these colors with my life-wine.'\r\n\r\n'Why, then,' she asked, carelessly, 'with your insufficient strength,\r\nwere you tempted to woo and follow me?'\r\n\r\nSo my life with its endeavors was a wreck. I thought of the good I had\r\nsacrificed, of the hopes that had failed. The Past and Future alike\r\npierced my hands with crucificial nails, till, faint with the pain and\r\nthe scorning, I lapsed into a long prostration, from which I came at\r\nlast to the dawn-light of sad, once-forgotten eyes--to the odor of\r\nwithered rosemary.\r\n\r\n'True heart that I spurned,' I cried, 'can you forgive? I will return\r\nAspiro scorn for scorn, and go humbly back, where it is perhaps not yet\r\ntoo late for happiness.'\r\n\r\nWith dreary reproaches came memory, disenthralled. I dreamed of my\r\nyouth, its love, and its aim. I pictured a porch with its breeze-tossed\r\nvines, a rocking boat on a limpid lake, a narrow path through\r\ntwilight-brooded woods, and each scene the shrine of a sweet face with\r\nbrown, banded hair, and love-lit eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd these pictures were the True. My heart cleaved the eternity of\r\nseparation, beaconing my sad return to them, and I followed gladly, hope\r\nbeing not yet dead.\r\n\r\nThe summer porch was shady with fragrant vines--but I missed the face. I\r\nbuoyed my heart, and said, 'Of course she would not have waited so\r\nlong.'\r\n\r\nI went to the woods, through the narrow paths where of old the birds\r\ntwittered, and javelins of sunshine pierced--on, where we had gone\r\ntogether long ago, till I reached the dell where we pledged our love.\r\nAh! I should find her here--\r\n\r\nThe sweet face where I should kindle smiles--the brown hair I could once\r\nmore stroke--the lithe form that I longed to clasp--the true heart that\r\nshould beat for me in a quiet home.\r\n\r\nNo. No waiting eyes--no true heart --no glad smile. But a cross and a\r\ngrave and a name:\r\n                                'CHRISTINE.'\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nAspirants of the Age! Offspring of Alo[=e]us I you have chosen a worship\r\nthat admits not a divided heart. But your faith, like the Mystic's,\r\nshall also make your strength; and though _Aspiro_ stoops not to your\r\nstature, yet she reigns, and she rewards. Be true. Be firm. Even if it\r\nbe upon the wreck of some frail, temporal heart-hopes, you _must_ reach\r\nhigher, till, in the sheen of the approving smile, you read the\r\nworld-lesson: Salvation through sacrifice. Through strife and\r\nsuffering--excellence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RED MAN'S PLEA.\r\n\r\nALMOST LITERALLY THE REPLY OF 'RED IRON' TO GOVERNOR RAMSEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The snow is on the ground, and still my people wait;\r\n  They ask but their just dues, ere yet it be too late;\r\n  For we are poor, our huts are cold, we starve, we die,\r\n  While you are rich, your fires are warm, your harvests lie\r\n  High heaped above the hunting grounds, our fathers' graves,\r\n  We sold you long ago. Alas! our famished braves\r\n  Have sold e'en their own graves! When dead, our bones shall stay\r\n  To whiten on the ground, that our Great Father may\r\n  More surely see where his Dacotah children died--\r\n  His dusky children whom ye robbed, and then belied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBUCKLE, DRAPER, AND A SCIENCE OF HISTORY\r\n\r\n_THIRD PAPER_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn any classification of our intellectual domain which it is possible to\r\nmake on the basis of Principles now known to the Scientific world at\r\nlarge, the most fundamental characteristic should be, the distinctive\r\nseparation of those departments of thought in which _Certainty_ is now\r\nattainable, from those in which only varying degrees of Probability\r\nexist, and the clear exhibition of that which is _positive and\r\ndemonstrable knowledge_, in the strict sense of the term, as\r\ndistinguished from that which is liable to be more or less fallible.\r\nAlthough the precise point at which, in some cases, the proofs of\r\nProbable Reasoning cease to be as convincing as those of Demonstration\r\ncannot be readily apprehended, yet the essential nature of the two\r\n_methods_ of proof is radically and inherently different, and is marked\r\nby the most distinctive results. In the latter case, we have always\r\naccuracy, precision, and certainty, _beyond the possibility of doubt_;\r\nin the former, always the conviction that, how strong soever the array\r\nof evidence may seem to be, in favor of a particular inference, there\r\nstill remains a possibility that the conclusion may be modified or\r\nvitiated by the subsequent advancement of knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe Generalizations which respectively affirm that all the angles of a\r\ntriangle are equal to two right angles, or that the square of the\r\nhypothenuse of a right-angled triangle is equal to the sum of the\r\nsquares of the other two sides, rest upon an entirely different basis of\r\nproof from those upon which the Generalizations rest which respectively\r\nassert that water is composed of certain chemical constituents combined\r\nin certain proportions, or that the nerves are the instruments of\r\nsensation and of motion. The former are irresistible conclusions of the\r\nhuman mind, because, from the nature of the intellect, they cannot be\r\nconceived of as being otherwise. The Laws of Thought are such, that we\r\nare unable to think a triangle whose angles will _not_ be equal to two\r\nright angles, or a right-angled one, the square of whose hypothenuse\r\nwill _not_ be equal to the squares of the other two sides. So long,\r\ntherefore, as man is constituted as he now is--unless the human\r\norganization becomes radically changed, these geometrical Laws cannot be\r\nconceived as being otherwise than as they are. All men must apprehend\r\nthem alike if they apprehend them at all. So long as man lives and\r\nthinks they remain unalterable verities, about which there can be no\r\nshadow of doubt, no possibility of error.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine that water is composed of certain definite chemical\r\nconstituents in certain definite proportions, or the theory that the\r\nnerves are the instruments of sensation and of motion, rests upon no\r\nsuch foundation. Whenever water has been analyzed, it has yielded the\r\nsame separate elements in the same proportions; and whenever these\r\nelements are put together in the same quantitative ratio they have\r\nproduced water; so that the conviction is proximately established in the\r\nminds of all that water is invariably the product of these elements in\r\ncertain proportions. But this proof does not establish the\r\ngeneralization as _inevitably true, nor show that it is impossible for\r\nit to be otherwise_. It is _possible_, in the nature of things, for us\r\nto conceive that the fluid which we call water may be produced from\r\nother constituents than oxygen or hydrogen, or that such a fluid may\r\neven now exist undiscovered, the product of elements altogether\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\nSo in regard to the nerves. Observation and experiment have established\r\nto the general satisfaction, that they are the instruments of sensation\r\nand motion; but we are not _absolutely sure_ that this is the fact, nor\r\ncan we _know_ that a human being may not be born in whom no trace of\r\nnerves can be detected, and who will nevertheless experience sensation\r\nand exhibit motion. We may be as well satisfied, for all practical\r\npurposes, of the nature of water and of the office of the nerves as of\r\nthe nature of a triangle; but the character of the evidence, on which\r\nthe convincement is based, is essentially different; being, in the one\r\ncase, incontrovertible and infallible; and, in the other, indecisive and\r\n_possibly_ fallacious.\r\n\r\nThis repetition of that which has been substantially stated before,\r\nbrings us to the final consideration of the distinctive nature of\r\ndifferent departments of Thought, as indicated by the Methods of Proof\r\nwhich respectively prevail in them; and hence as embodying either exact\r\nand definite _Knowledge_, or only varying degrees of _Probability_. We\r\nhave already seen that in at least one sphere of intellectual activity\r\nwe are able to start from the most basic and fundamental conceptions,\r\nfrom axiomatic truths so patent and universal that they cannot even be\r\nconceived of as being otherwise than as they are, and to proceed from\r\nthem, by equally irresistible Inferences, to conclusions which are, from\r\nthe nature of the human mind, inevitable. It is in the Mathematics, in\r\nwhich the Deductive Method is rightly operative, that this kind of\r\nProof--Demonstration in the strict sense of the term--prevails. The\r\nvarious branches of Mathematics have therefore been appropriately\r\ndenominated the _Exact_ Sciences, in contradistinction from those\r\ndomains of Thought whose Laws or Principles are liable to be somewhat\r\nindefinite or uncertain; hence, called the _Inexact_ Sciences.\r\n\r\nExact Science--in its largest sense, that which extends to all domains\r\nin which the proper Deductive Method has been or may hereafter be\r\nrightly employed--is therefore a _system or series of truths relating to\r\nthe whole Universe, or to some department of it, consecutively and\r\nnecessarily resulting from, and dependent upon, each other, in a\r\ndefinite chain or series; and resting primarily upon some fundamental\r\ntruth or truths so simple and self-evident, that, when clearly stated,\r\nall men must, by the natural constitution of the human mind, perceive\r\nthem and recognize them as true. Demonstration is the pointing out of\r\nthe definite links in the chain or series by which we go from\r\nfundamental truths, clearly perceived and irresistible, up to the\r\nparticular truth in question_.\r\n\r\nThus far in the history of Science, Mathematics, as a whole, has ranked\r\nas the only Exact Science; being the only department of intellectual\r\nactivity, all of whose Laws or Principles are established on a basis of\r\n_undeniable certainty_. If, however, theories of Cosmogony and\r\nconsiderations of Cosmography be excluded from the field of Astronomy,\r\nthis Science consists almost wholly of the application of the Laws of\r\nMathematics to the movements of the celestial bodies. Restricting\r\nAstronomy proper to this domain, where, as a _Science_, it strictly\r\nbelongs, and setting aside its merely descriptive and conjectural\r\nfeatures, as hardly an integral part of the Science itself, we have\r\nanother Exact Science in addition to Mathematics.\r\n\r\nOf still another domain, that of Physics, Professor Silliman says, 'all\r\nits phenomena are dependent on a limited number of general laws ...\r\nwhich may be represented by numbers and algebraic symbols; and these\r\ncondensed _formulæ_ enable us to conduct investigations with the\r\ncertainty and precision of pure Mathematics.'\r\n\r\nThe various branches of Physics have not hitherto been ranked as Exact\r\nSciences, because, as in Astronomy, unsubstantiated theories and\r\ndoubtful generalizations, incapable of Mathematical Proof, have mingled\r\nwith their _Demonstrated_ Laws and Phenomena, as a component part of\r\nthe Science itself. It has consequently exhibited an ambiguous or\r\nproblematical aspect, incompatible with the rigorous requirements of\r\nExact Science. Even in Professor Silliman's admirable work, _formulæ_\r\nare given as Laws, which, however correct, have yet no foundation in\r\naxiomatic truth; while Inferences are drawn from them which are by no\r\nmeans capable of _Demonstration_. Strictly speaking, however, only those\r\nLaws which _do_ rest upon a Demonstrable basis and the Phenomena derived\r\nfrom them come within the scope of the _Science_ of Physics. So far as\r\nthese prevail, this department of investigation is entitled to the\r\nMathematical character accorded to it by Professor Silliman, and ranks\r\nas an Exact Science.\r\n\r\nAstronomy and Physics, viewed in the light in which they are here\r\npresented, are rather special branches of Mathematics, than distinct\r\nSciences. But as we often speak of Geometry as a separate Science,\r\nalthough it is in reality only a division of the Mathematical domain,\r\nand is so classed by Comte; so there is a sense in which both Astronomy\r\nand Physics, as herein defined, may be regarded as individual Sciences,\r\nand in that character they will be considered in this paper.\r\n\r\nWe have, then, three domains in which the true Deductive Method is\r\nactive; in which we can start from universally recognized Truths and\r\nproceed, by irresistible Inferences, to ulterior Principles and Facts.\r\nIn three Sciences, in Mathematics as commonly defined and understood, in\r\nAstronomy and Physics as herein circumscribed, we are able to establish\r\nstarting points of thought with Mathematical certainty, and to deduce\r\nfrom them all the Phenomena of their respective realms.\r\n\r\nWithin the scope of these three Sciences, therefore, our information is\r\nclearly defined, positive, and indisputable. The conclusions to which we\r\nare led by their Principles can no more be gainsayed than human\r\nexistence can be doubted. While time shall last, while mankind shall\r\nendure, while the human Mind is constructed on its present basis; while,\r\nin fine, there is a possibility for the exercise of Thought in any way\r\nconceivable to the existing Mentality of the universe, the Laws of\r\nMathematics, of Astronomy, and of Physics can be apprehended in no way\r\ndifferent from that in which they are now apprehended. There is _no\r\nconceivable possibility_ that subsequent investigations will show them\r\nto be erroneous or defective. They stand upon a foundation of Proof as\r\nunalterable as the fiat of Fate or the decrees of the Almighty, which\r\ncan neither be shaken nor destroyed.\r\n\r\nIt is between these three Mathematical Sciences, on the one side, and\r\nall other domains of intellectual investigation on the other, that a\r\nline of distinct demarcation must be drawn, in any Classification of our\r\nso-called Knowledge, in accordance with any method of classification\r\nknown to the scientific world at large. Not that the Laws or Principles\r\nwhich lie at the base of all other departments of the universe are not\r\nas stable, as definite, and as infallible as those which inhere in the\r\nSciences which have been specially indicated. But that, as yet, the\r\nendeavor to apprehend fundamental Principles, in other spheres than\r\nthese, has been attended with only partial success; and hence, the\r\nability to establish a Mathematical or Demonstrable basis for other\r\nregions of Thought is yet wanting, so far as is commonly known.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, we emerge from the domains of Mathematics, Astronomy,\r\nand Physics, we are leaving the field of _positive assurance_, of\r\n_undeniable_ truth, and entering the realms where opinion, conjecture,\r\nand variable degrees of certainty prevail. _The Facts of Observation may\r\nbe, indeed, as plain here as elsewhere and as firmly established. But\r\nthe conclusions drawn from them, the Scientific Principles assumed to\r\nbe established, may be erroneous or defective, and the power of\r\nprevision, the great test of Scientific accuracy, is proportionally\r\nwanting._ Derived, as we have hitherto seen these conclusions to be,\r\nfrom Phenomena, on the supposition that a given range of Observation\r\nwill secure all the essential Principles which appertain to the _whole_\r\nof the Phenomena included in the range, we can never be _entirely sure_\r\nthat our basis of Facts is sufficient for our purpose, and hence the\r\n_possibility_ of error always exists.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be understood, therefore, that first or observational\r\n_Facts_ are not rightly to be known in other departments of\r\ninvestigation than Mathematics, Astronomy, and Physics; but that Laws,\r\nPrinciples, or Generalizations which _relate_ Facts and serve as\r\ninstruments for penetrating into the deeper arcana of Nature, cannot be\r\nprecisely, accurately, and certainly _known_, in their relations and\r\nbelongings, until we are able to establish their connection with the\r\nlowest, most fundamental, and self-evident truths, and in this manner\r\nbecome competent to advance step by step from undeniable first truths to\r\nthose equally undeniable. In Mathematics, in Astronomy, and in Physics,\r\nwe are able to do this. We _know_ the Laws or Principles of these\r\nSciences, therefore, so far as we have developed the Sciences\r\nthemselves. We know the relations of the various Laws within the range\r\nof each Science, and the relations of the different Sciences with each\r\nother. We can advance, within their boundaries, from the simplest and\r\nmost positive verities, such as the whole is equal to all its parts--a\r\nself-evident truth, which it is impossible to conceive as being\r\notherwise than as here stated--up to the most intricate ulterior Facts\r\nof the universe, by Inferences which are as irresistible to the mind as\r\nthe axioms with which we started. In no other domains of Thought can\r\nthis be done by any methods now in vogue. In no other realms, therefore,\r\nare complete precision and infallibility attainable. It is this which\r\nconstitutes the peculiar character of these three Sciences, and\r\ndistinguishes them radically from all others.\r\n\r\nThe whole body of our authoritative and irrevocably determinate\r\nintellectual acquisitions lies, therefore, at the present time, so far\r\nas is commonly known, within the range of Mathematics, Astronomy, and\r\nPhysics. These are in strictness the only _Sciences_ which we possess;\r\nand the only domains in which _knowledge_, in the proper sense of the\r\nterm, is attainable. In passing their boundaries, we leave the regions\r\nof positive _certitude_, and come into the domain where Conjecture,\r\nvarying from the strongest presumption to mere plausibility, is the\r\nhighest proof. Laws or Principles are yet undiscovered there, and in\r\ntheir place we find Generalizations--Suppositive or Proximate\r\nLaws--which are in process of proof, or already established by such\r\nevidence as the Inductive Method can array, and which carry the\r\nconviction of their correctness with varying degrees of force, to larger\r\nor smaller classes of investigators.\r\n\r\nThese three branches of knowledge are unquestionably entitled to the\r\ndesignation of _Positive_ Sciences; and to no others can it with justice\r\nbe accorded. To apply the name of _Science_ to domains in which real\r\nknowledge is not attainable, is, in some sense, an abuse of terms. To\r\ndenominate _Positive Sciences_, domains which are not strictly\r\nScientific, and in which _positive_ certainty, in reference to\r\nPrinciples and ulterior Facts, cannot be attained, is still more\r\nincongruous. Comte's arrangement of the schedule of the Positive\r\nSciences, in which domains where Demonstrable knowledge prevails are\r\nplaced upon a common basis with those in which it does not, was probably\r\nowing to the want of a clear perception on his part of the essential\r\ndifference of the nature of proof by the true Deductive Method and of\r\nproof by the Inductive Method, of the _actual_ Certainty of the one and\r\nthe merely _proximate_ Certainty of the other.\r\n\r\nIf such were the case, his want of discrimination was rather due to an\r\noverestimate of Inductive proof than to an undervaluation of\r\nMathematical Demonstration. That Mathematics, Astronomy, and Physics\r\nwere more perfect Sciences than the others in point of _precision_, he\r\ndistinctly affirms, pointing out that 'the relative perfection of the\r\ndifferent Sciences consists in the degree of precision of Knowledge,'\r\nthat this degree of precision is in accordance with the extent to which\r\nMathematical analysis can be applied to the given domain, and that to\r\nthe above-mentioned Sciences only is its application possible.\r\nNotwithstanding this apprehension of the different degrees of\r\n_precision_ or _exactitude_ attainable in the various Scientific realms,\r\nhe does not seem to have sufficiently understood that there was also a\r\nvast difference in the _nature of the evidence_ which went to prove the\r\ntruth of the supposed Principles and ulterior Facts of the various\r\ndepartments of Thought, and hence variable degrees of _Certainty_ in\r\nregard to the positive bases of the Principles themselves. He thus falls\r\ninto the same error which it was one of the main purposes of his\r\nScientific labors to correct--commingling problematical theories with\r\nDemonstrable Truths, as equally entitled to belief--and ranks Sociology,\r\nincluding _La Morale_, afterward called a distinct Science, with\r\nMathematics, Astronomy, and Physics, as domains in which our reasonings,\r\nin the present state of Knowledge, can be equally reliable.\r\n\r\nIt is barely possible that the purpose and design of Comte's\r\nClassification had, unconsciously, much to do with its really\r\nunscientific and incongruous character. The aim which he had in view was\r\nto construct a Sociology or Science of Society which should be a guide\r\nin the establishment of a new Government, a new Political Economy, a new\r\nReligion, a new Social Life, a new Order of Things, in fine, to take the\r\nplace of the decrepit institutions, governmental, ecclesiastical, and\r\nsocial, which he thought were fast approaching their period of\r\ndissolution. The Generalization which had exhibited to him, that the\r\nLaws and Phenomena of the various departments of investigation were\r\ndependent on each other in a graduated scale, and had thus enabled him\r\nto establish the _Hierarchy of the Sciences_, showed him that Sociology,\r\nincluding as it does the Principles and Phenomena of the other domains\r\nwhich he regards as Positive Sciences, must be based upon them.\r\n\r\nHence it became necessary to fix the Scientific character of all these\r\nbranches of intelligence, in order to create a Scientific basis for his\r\nSociology. It was, however, impossible for him to claim that a\r\nDemonstrable or Infallible method of Proof was applicable to Chemistry\r\nand Biology; while, on the other hand, to exhibit such a method as\r\nintroducing a certainty into Mathematics, Astronomy, and Physics which\r\ndid not appertain to the other so-called Positive Sciences, would have\r\nindicated too plainly the unspanned gulf which yawned between the\r\nindubitable Demonstrations of the Exact Sciences and the merely probable\r\nGeneralizations of the others, and have exposed the fallible character\r\nof his Sociological theories.\r\n\r\nA Classification was rendered indispensable, therefore, which should\r\ndisplay uniformity in its character, and a sufficiently rigorous mode of\r\nScientific proof. To fulfil this end, the Inexact Sciences were accorded\r\na position of _certainty_ in reference to their Principles which does\r\nnot in reality belong to them; while the Exact or Infallible Sciences\r\nwere degraded from their peculiarly high state, and brought to the new\r\nlevel of the former on the middle ground of the Positive Philosophy. A\r\nquasi-Scientific basis was thus erected for the Sociological movements\r\nof the French Reformer.\r\n\r\nHad he been as _Metaphysically analytical_, _profound_, and\r\n_discriminating_ in his intellectual development, as he was _vigorous_,\r\n_expansive_, and _broadly generalising_, he would have discerned the\r\ninsufficiency of the bases of the structure which he was building. Had\r\nhe understood the Scientific problem of the age, he would have known\r\nthat until the task which he believed too great for accomplishment was\r\nadequately performed, until all the phenomena of the respective Sciences\r\nwere brought within the scope of a larger Science and included under a\r\nUniversal Law, there could be no 'clearness, precision, and consistency'\r\nthroughout all our domains of Thought, and hence no _true_ Sociology.\r\nHad he rightly apprehended the nature of 'The Grand Man,' as he aptly\r\ndenominates Humanity, he would not have failed to perceive that the\r\nattempt to measure the capacities and requirements of Society by the\r\ncapacities and requirements of any individual or individuals, how\r\ncatholic soever they may be, is but the repetition of the Procrustean\r\nprinciple on a broader basis, and that a reconstructive movement\r\nestablished on such a foundation could not meet the wants of this\r\nindividualized epoch. That he should not have perceived that the capital\r\nand necessary precursor of any true Science of Society must be a\r\nUniversal Science, a Science of Universal Laws underlying and unifying\r\nPhysics and Metaphysics, is not strange, when we consider his peculiar\r\nmental characteristics. That he should ever have anticipated any\r\npermanent acceptance of his Sociological Theories, or regarded his\r\nSocial Institutions as anything more than transitional forms, could only\r\nhave been due to a lack of the highest Scientific powers, and to an\r\nearnest impatience at beholding Humanity crawling along the path of\r\nProgress by the aid of obsolete instrumentalities.\r\n\r\nThe work which Auguste Comte accomplished was immense. Its value can\r\nhardly be overestimated. Every modern Scientist and Thinker is largely\r\nindebted to him for that which is indispensable to high intellectual\r\ndevelopment and progress in thought. For the immense steps in Scientific\r\nadvancement which he took; for his love of his Race; for his really\r\nreligious spirit, exhibited in his utter devotion to that which he\r\ndeemed the highest right; the love and sympathy of every student of\r\nScience and every devotee of truth is, and will be, forever his. That he\r\nfailed in achieving a permanent Scientific basis of a sufficiently\r\nuniversal and unquestionable character--a real Universology, which\r\nshould exhibit the essential verity of the _religious intuitions_ of the\r\npast, and should establish their inherent and harmonious connection with\r\nthe unfolding _intellectual discoveries_ of the present--is true. But it\r\nshould not be forgotten that every attempt, made in the right direction,\r\nwhich comes short of the final result, is but a stepping stone for the\r\nnext effort, and, viewed as a single round in the great ladder of human\r\nascension, a success--an element without which the final achievement\r\nwould have been impossible. Without Comte there would have been no\r\nBuckle, whose work furnishes another of these steps. Every page of the\r\n'History of Civilization' exhibits the indebtedness of the English\r\nHistorian to the French Encyclopædist of the Sciences; while the\r\n'Intellectual Development of Europe' bears evidence of a 'Positivist'\r\ninspiration to which Professor Draper might have more completely yielded\r\nwith decided benefit. For the lift which the author of the Positive\r\nPhilosophy and the founder of the Positive Religion has given the world,\r\nlet us be deeply grateful; although we must reject, as a finality, a\r\nSystem of Science which cannot _Demonstrate_ the correctness of its\r\nPrinciples and Phenomena, or a System of Religion which emasculates\r\nmankind of its diviner and more spiritual aspirations, and dwarfs him to\r\nthe dimensions of a refined Materialism.\r\n\r\nIn classifying our existing Knowledge, then, on our present basis of\r\nScientific acquisition, we must draw a distinct line between\r\nMathematics, Astronomy, and Physics, on the one side, and all remaining\r\ndepartments of Thought, on the other, and set these three Sciences apart\r\nas the Exact or Infallible ones, occupying a rank superior to the\r\nothers, by virtue of the Certainty and Exactitude with which we are\r\nable, through the operation of the true Deductive Method, to ascertain\r\ntheir Principles and Phenomena. We shall then be enabled--by the aid of\r\nComte's principle that the domains of investigation take rank in\r\nproportion to the complexity of their Phenomena--to ascertain, after a\r\nvery brief examination, the place which History holds in the Scale, and\r\nhow much claim it can lay to a Scientific character.\r\n\r\nComte closes the Hierarchy of the Positive Sciences by adding to the\r\nthree which we have denominated _Exact_ Sciences, Chemistry, Biology,\r\nSociology, and _La Morale_, in the order in which they are named, as\r\nindicated by the nature of the Phenomena with which they are concerned.\r\nIf we adopt this arrangement, and annex to each of these _general_\r\nSciences, as they are called in the language of Positivism, its derived\r\nor dependent branches, we shall have the following order: Chemistry;\r\nGeology; Biology, including Botany, Human and Comparative Anatomy, and\r\nPhysiology; Zoology; Sociology; and _La Morale_. Although this enlarged\r\nscale is defective, many important departments, such as Ethnology,\r\nPhilology, etc., being left out, it is sufficiently correct to show the\r\ncomplex nature of the Phenomena with which History must concern itself.\r\n\r\nHistory--in its largest aspect, that in which we are now considering\r\nit--is the record of the progress of the Race in all its various modes\r\nof development. In it is therefore involved the examination and\r\nconsideration of all the agencies, Material or Spiritual, which have\r\noperated on Mankind through past ages. Mathematical questions concerning\r\nNumber, Form, and Force; Astronomical problems on the relation of our\r\nEarth to other Celestial bodies, and the effect thereof on Climate,\r\nSoil, and Modes of Life; Physical inquiries into the influence of Heat,\r\nElectricity, etc., on individuals and nations; Chemical investigations\r\ninto the nature of different kinds of Food, and their relations to the\r\nanimal economy, and hence to the career of Peoples; Geological\r\nresearches to discover the origin of the human Race, and its position in\r\nthe Animal Kingdom; questions of Physiology, of Social Life, of\r\nEthnology, of Metaphysics, of Religion; every problem, in fine, which\r\nthe world has been called to consider, forms a part of the record of its\r\nprogress and comes within the scope of History. As the Descriptology, or\r\nverbal daguerreotyping of the Continuity of Society, and hence of the\r\nDynamical aspect of Concrete Sociology, History stands, then, in a\r\nsense, at the head of the scale, omitting Theology, the true apex of the\r\npyramid of Sciences, which pyramid Comte has decapitated of this very\r\napex.\r\n\r\nThe problems which History is called to solve are therefore exceedingly\r\nintricate and perplexing. The Generalizations of Chemistry, conducted,\r\nas they must be, on our present basis of Knowledge, by the Inductive\r\nMethod, are involved in a degree of uncertainty, not only on account of\r\nthe complexity of their Phenomena, but also by reason of the absence of\r\nany method of ascertaining when all the elements of a right\r\nGeneralization are obtained. In Geology, including Mineralogy, the\r\ncomplexity increases, and the possibility of precision and certainty\r\ndecreases in the same ratio. This augmentation of complexity in the\r\nPhenomena and proportionate diminution of exactitude and certainty in\r\nrespect to the Generalizations derived from them, continues at every\r\nsuccessive degree of the scale; so that when we arrive at History, all\r\nhope of even proximate precision, and all expectation of anything like\r\npositive Knowledge, except in the broadest outline and generalization,\r\nby any application of the Inductive Method, has completely vanished.\r\n\r\nThe hopelessness of a Science of History prior to the discovery of a\r\nUnitary Law and the introduction of the Deductive Method into all\r\ndomains of investigation, now becomes plainly apparent. Until the\r\noccurrence of that event we shall look in vain for a true Science of\r\nHistory. With the advent of such a discovery, it will be possible to\r\ncarry the precision and infallibility of Mathematical Demonstration into\r\nall departments of Thought, and to subject the Phenomena of History to\r\nwell-defined and indubitable Laws.\r\n\r\nWe must guard, however, against entertaining the supposition that a\r\nUnitary Science will bring _all_ the Phenomena of the universe within\r\nthe compass of _Demonstrable_ apprehension. The province of Science is\r\nnot infinite, but circumscribed. We are limited in the application of\r\nMathematical Laws, even within the sphere of Pure Mathematics; general\r\nequations of the fifth degree having until recently resisted all\r\nattempts to solve them; and fields yet remain into which we cannot\r\nadvance. The power of the human mind to analyze Phenomena ceases at some\r\npoint, and there our ability to _apply_ Scientific Principles, however\r\nindubitable in themselves, ends. It is the office of Exact Science to\r\nfurnish us with a knowledge of the inherent Laws which everywhere\r\npervade the Universe and govern continuously and unalterably its\r\nactivities. To the extent to which it is possible to trace the\r\nconstituent elements of Thought or Things we can have the guidance of\r\nthese Laws or Principles. But when we reach that point in any department\r\nof investigation where the complexity of the Phenomena renders it\r\nimpossible for the human intellect to successfully analyze it and\r\ndiscover its separate parts, the sphere of accurate Scientific Knowledge\r\nis transcended. The Intuition--the faculty which apprehends what we may\r\ncall the spirit of _Concrete_ things, which goes to conclusions by a\r\nrapid process that overleaps intermediate steps, which is our guide in\r\nthe numerous decisions that we are called to make in our every-day life,\r\nand which perceives, in a somewhat vague and indefinite manner--becomes\r\nour only guide in this Realm of the Inexact.\r\n\r\nThe advent of a Unitary Science and the inauguration of a true Deductive\r\nMethod in all domains of Thought, will, indeed, completely revolutionize\r\nour Scientific bases, and render precision and infallibility possible in\r\ndomains where now only conjecture and probability exist. It will enable\r\nus to establish on a firm and secure foundation the _Laws or Principles\r\nof every department of the Universe of Matter and of Mind_, and to\r\npenetrate the Phenomena of all realms to an extent now scarcely\r\nimagined. It will furnish us the 'Criterion of Truth' so long sought\r\nafter--a ground of intellectual agreement in all the concerns of life,\r\nso far as this is essential, similar to that which we now have in\r\nMathematics, where difference of opinion is impossible because _proof is\r\nof a nature to be alike convincing to all_.\r\n\r\nBut, as in Mathematics a limit is reached, beyond which the finite\r\ncharacter of our intelligence does not permit us to _apply_ the Laws\r\nwhich we are well assured still prevail, so there is an outlying circle\r\nof practical activity which no Science can compass. The various tints of\r\nthe autumn forest are probably the results of Mathematical arrangements\r\nof particles; but to how great an extent we shall be able to discover\r\nwhat precise arrangement produces a given shade of color, is doubtful.\r\nSome delicate varieties, at least, will always be beyond our definite\r\napprehension. Whether we shall dine at one hour or another, whether we\r\nwill wear gray or black, and innumerable other questions of specialty,\r\ndo not come within the range of Scientific solution, and never can. So\r\nthat when every domain of human concern is solidly established on a\r\nbasis of Exact Science, there will still remain a field of indefinite\r\nextent, in which the Intuitive application of eternal Principles will\r\nfurnish an unlimited activity for the Practical, Æsthetic, Imaginative,\r\nIdealistic, Artistic, and Religious faculties of Mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe task which Mr. Buckle set himself to accomplish was, in a marked\r\nsense, original and peculiar. Although several systematic attempts had\r\nbeen made in Europe, prior to his time, to investigate the history of\r\nman according to those exhaustive methods which in other branches of\r\nKnowledge have proved successful, and by which alone empirical\r\nobservations can be raised to scientific truths, the imperfect state of\r\nthe Physical Sciences necessarily rendered the execution of such an\r\nundertaking extremely defective. It was not, indeed, until the vast mass\r\nof Facts which make up the body of the various Sciences had been\r\nincluded within appropriate formulæ, and until the elaborate\r\nClassification of Auguste Comte had separated that which was properly\r\nKnowledge from that which was not, with sufficient exactitude to answer\r\nthe purposes of broad Generalization, and had established the relations\r\nof the different domains of intelligence, that such a work as the\r\n'History of Civilization' was possible.\r\n\r\nPrevious Historians, with these few exceptions, had contented themselves\r\nwith the narration of the _Facts_ of national progress, the merely\r\nsuperficial exhibition of the external method of a people's life, and\r\nhad almost wholly neglected or greatly subordinated the Philosophical or\r\nScientific aspect of the subject, namely, the causes of the given\r\ndevelopment. Separate domains of History had, indeed, been examined with\r\nconsiderable ability; but hardly any attempt had been made to combine\r\nthe various parts into a consistent whole, and ascertain in what way\r\nthey were connected with each other. Still less had there been any\r\nnotable effort to apply the whole body of our existing knowledge to the\r\nelucidation of the problem of human progress. While the necessity of\r\ngeneralization in all the other great realms of investigation had been\r\nfreely conceded, and strenuous exertions had been made to rise from\r\nparticular Facts to the discovery of the Laws by which those Facts are\r\ngoverned, Historians continued to pursue the stereotyped course of\r\nmerely relating events, interspersed with such reflections as seemed\r\ninteresting or instructive.\r\n\r\nUp to the period when Mr. Buckle essayed his 'History of Civilization,'\r\nfew, if any, of the well-known modern Historians had conceived that an\r\nacquaintance with all the departments of human intelligence was a\r\nnecessary accomplishment in a writer on the past career of the world,\r\nand no one of them had undertaken to write history from that basis.\r\n'Hence,' says the author whom we are considering, and who makes, in the\r\nfirst pages of his book, substantially the same statements concerning\r\nthe condition of Historical literature which are made here--'hence the\r\nsingular spectacle of one historian being ignorant of political economy;\r\nanother knowing nothing of law; another, nothing of ecclesiastical\r\naffairs, and changes of opinion; another neglecting the philosophy of\r\nstatistics, and another physical science; although these topics are the\r\nmost essential of all, inasmuch as they comprise the principal\r\ncircumstances by which the temper and character of mankind have been\r\naffected, and in which they are displayed. These important pursuits\r\nbeing, however, cultivated, some by one man, and some by another, have\r\nbeen isolated rather than united: the aid which might be derived from\r\nanalogy and from mutual illustration has been lost; and no disposition\r\nhas been shown to concentrate them upon history, of which they are,\r\nproperly speaking, the necessary components.'\r\n\r\nThe work which Mr. Buckle contemplated was designed to supply this\r\n_desideratum_ in respect to History. It was an endeavor to discover 'the\r\nPrinciples which govern the character and destiny of nations,' an effort\r\n'to bring up this great department of inquiry to a level with other\r\ndepartments,' 'to accomplish for the history of man something\r\nequivalent, or at all events analogous to, what has been effected by\r\nother inquirers for the different branches of Natural Science,' and 'to\r\nelevate the study of history from its present crude and informal state,'\r\nand place 'it in its proper rank, as the head and chief of all the\r\nSciences.'\r\n\r\nAt the outset of his undertaking, we have ample evidence that the\r\ncapacious-minded Englishman had fixed upon no less a labor than '_to\r\nsolve the great problem of affairs; to detect those hidden circumstances\r\nwhich determine the march and destiny of nations; and to find, in the\r\nevents of the past, a key to the proceedings of the future, which is\r\nnothing less than to unite into a single science all the laws of the\r\nmoral and physical world_.' He was thus bent, doubtless with only a\r\nvague apprehension of the nature of the problem, on the discovery of\r\nthat Unitary Law, whose apprehension is so anxiously awaited, _which is\r\nto cement the various branches of our Knowledge into a Universal\r\nScience, and furnish an Exact basis for all our thinking_.\r\n\r\nThe Method which Mr. Buckle employed in the prosecution of his\r\nmagnificent design was the Inductive. He made 'a collection of\r\nhistorical and scientific facts,' drew from them such conclusions as he\r\nthought they suggested and authorized; and then applied the\r\nGeneralizations thus obtained to the elucidation of the career of\r\nvarious countries. When we consider the nature of the work undertaken\r\nand the means by which it was to be achieved, we can hardly deny, that\r\nthis attempt to create a Science of History was, in a distinguishing\r\nsense, the most gigantic intellectual effort which the world has ever\r\nbeen called to witness. The domain of investigation was almost new. The\r\npoint of Observation entirely so. Vast masses of Facts encumbered it,\r\naggregated in orderless heaps--orderless, at least, so far as his uses\r\nwere subserved. Comte had, indeed, brought the different departments of\r\ninquiry into proximately definite relations in obedience to an\r\n_abstract_ and _Static_ Law; but while this labor was, in other\r\nrespects, an essential preliminary to Mr. Buckle's undertaking, it was\r\nof little _immediate_ value in an attempt to secure the direct solution\r\nof the most intricate and complex questions of Concrete _dynamical_\r\nSociology, involving the unstable and shifting contingencies of\r\nindividual activity. The whole of the intellectual accumulations of the\r\ncenturies may be said to have been piled about the English Thinker, and\r\nhe was to discover in and derive from them the unerring Law or Laws\r\nwhich should serve to explain, with at least something approaching\r\nprecision and clearness, the kaleidoscopic phases of human existence.\r\n\r\nOnly one generally known effort in the realm of Thought bears any\r\ncomparison to this, examined in reference to the vigor, breadth, and\r\nvariety of the mental faculties which it called into requisition. Viewed\r\nin connection with the work of the founder of the Positive School, we\r\nmay say, without any disparagement to the comprehensive abilities of the\r\nFrench Philosopher, that the task undertaken by the English Historian\r\nrequired a tenacity of intellectual grasp, a steadiness of mental\r\nvision, a scope of generalizing power, an all-embracing scholarship, a\r\nmarvellous accumulation of Facts, and a wonderful readiness to handle\r\nthem, which even the prodigious labors of the Positive Philosophy did\r\nnot demand. Comte had, indeed, like Buckle, to arrange the Facts of the\r\nuniverse into order. But in his case they were only to be grouped under\r\nappropriate headings, and, as it were, quietly labeled.\r\n\r\nWith the author of 'Civilization in England' it was otherwise. In the\r\n_actual_ careers of men and of nations, Facts do not stand related to\r\neach other and to human actions in the distinct and distinguishable way\r\nin which they appear when correlated, as by Comte, in accordance with\r\ngeneral Laws. The domain of the _concrete_, or of practical life, has\r\nalways a variable element which does not obtain in the sphere of\r\ngeneralizing Principles, and which immensely complicates the\r\ninvestigation of the problems of real existence. Comte purposely\r\nexcluded the realm of the _concrete_ from his studies, and therefore\r\nsimplified, to a great extent, his field of labor. Yet even in his\r\nattempt to bring order into this curtailed department of inquiry, he\r\nprofesses, not merely his own inability to accomplish, but his\r\nconviction of the inherent impossibility of the accomplishment of that,\r\nfor the _abstract_ only, which Buckle really undertook for the\r\n_concrete_; namely, the reduction of the Phenomena of the Universe to a\r\nsingle Law; or, what is synonymous, the integration of all the laws of\r\nthe moral and physical world into a single Science.\r\n\r\nThe character of his undertaking compelled Mr. Buckle, on the contrary,\r\nto stretch his mental antennæ into every department of mundane activity,\r\nto hold the Facts there discovered, so far as he might, collectively\r\nwithin his grasp, and to draw them by an irresistible strain into\r\ngradually decreasing circles of generalization, until they were brought\r\nto a Central Law, which should contain within itself the many-sided\r\nexplanation of the intricate ramifications of individual and national\r\ncareers. The difference in the work essayed by the two distinguished\r\nThinkers whose labors we are considering, is somewhat analogous to that\r\nwhich exists between the profession of the apothecary and that of the\r\nphysician. The former must know the range of _Materia Medica_, and the\r\ncontents of the _Pharmacopæia_, so far as is necessary to arrange the\r\nvarious medicines in order, and deliver them when called for. The latter\r\nmust hold the different remedies in his knowledge, not as classified\r\nupon the pharmaceutist's shelves, but as related to the various forms of\r\nconstantly changing vital Phenomena, in the midst of which he is to\r\ndetect their applicability to different forms of disease. Still more\r\nanalogous is Comte to the student of Natural History, whose business it\r\nis, preëminently, to distribute and classify the Animal Kingdom, in\r\naccordance with Generalizations which relate mainly to the form or type\r\nof organization; while Buckle resembles the student of a higher rank,\r\nwho endeavors, in the midst of the play of passion and the actual\r\nexhibitions of life itself, to read the nature of the mental and moral\r\ndevelopment which exists beneath them and controls their workings.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that, up to a period subsequent to the publication of his\r\nfirst volume, the writer of the 'History of Civilization' entertained\r\nthe fullest confidence in the ability of the Inductive Method to cope\r\nwith the ultimate problems of the Universe, and had high expectations of\r\nbeing able, through its instrumentality, to reduce the whole body of our\r\nKnowledge to a systematic whole, and to establish a Science of Sciences\r\nwhich should be a Criterion of Truth, and the crowning intellectual\r\nachievement of the ages. Whether Mr. Buckle fully comprehended the real\r\nnature of the Science toward which he was aiming; whether he entirely\r\nappreciated the radical and important change which its discovery would\r\nnecessarily introduce into our Methods of Investigation;--whether he\r\nsaw that it would be the inauguration of a true Deductive Mode of\r\nreasoning, which would enable us to advance with incredible rapidity and\r\ncertainty into the arcana of those departments which he was then obliged\r\nto explore with the most tedious research, the most plodding patience,\r\nand the most destructive intellectual tension, in order to accumulate a\r\nlimited array of Facts, is somewhat doubtful.\r\n\r\nThe significant sentence which occurs in the second volume of his work,\r\nclosely following the announcement of his disappointment at being unable\r\nto achieve all that he had expected and promised, and which states that\r\n'in a complete scheme of our knowledge, and when all our resources are\r\nfully developed and marshalled into order, as they must eventually be,\r\nthe two methods [the Inductive and the Deductive] will be, not hostile,\r\nbut supplementary, and will be combined into a single system,' seems to\r\nindicate that at some period prior to the publication of the second\r\nvolume, and subsequent to the issue of the first, the insufficient\r\nnature of the Inductive Method as a Scientific guide broke upon him, and\r\nsome conception of the nature of a Mode of Reasoning which should\r\ncombine the two Processes in just relations, began to dawn into his\r\nmind. That he obtained anything more than a faint glimpse of the true\r\nMethod, is not likely. Had he done so, he would certainly have made some\r\nstatement of the great results which would follow its inauguration, even\r\nif he could have refrained from bestowing one of his glowing and\r\nenraptured paragraphs upon the fairest and most entrancing vision of\r\nfuture achievement which the devotee of intellectual investigation will\r\never witness.\r\n\r\nIt is probable, that in carrying on his investigations after the\r\npublication of the first volume of his work, finding it impossible to\r\nhandle the accumulations of Facts necessary to his purpose, and\r\ndiscovering the inexactitude and insufficiency of his Generalizations in\r\nthe ratio that the bounds of his field of inquiry enlarged, he was led\r\nto perceive the essential weakness and inadequacy of the Inductive\r\nMethod, and the probable certainty that, at some future period, the\r\nprogress of our Knowledge would lead to the establishment of positive\r\nbases for all departments of investigation, and thus furnish an\r\nopportunity for the harmonious and reciprocal activity of the two\r\nhitherto antagonistic Methods. That he had any definite idea of the\r\nprecise nature of the bases on which this union would take place, that\r\nhe perceived the exact character of the Science of Universology which it\r\nwould create, or contemplated the subordination of the Inductive Process\r\nto the Deductive, there is no indication.\r\n\r\nBut whatever may have been Mr. Buckle's understanding or expectation in\r\nreference to the future, it is certain that between the publication of\r\nthe first and second volumes of his History, the hope which he had\r\nformed and announced of being able to create a Science of History had\r\nvanished, and his efforts were confined to a less extensive programme.\r\nThe pages in which this change of purpose is made known display, in\r\ntouching outlines, tinged with a noble sadness, that the soul of the\r\ngreat Englishman was, in all the attributes of magnanimity, at least, a\r\nfitting mate for his intellect.\r\n\r\nA storm of obloquy had assailed him at the outset of his labor.\r\nBeginning with the time when the first instalment of 'Civilization in\r\nEngland' was given to the public, passion, prejudice, and pride had\r\nstrained their powers to vilify his character and heap abuse upon his\r\nname. The Press, the Pulpit, and the Lyceum, with rare and brave\r\nexceptions, met the formidable array of Facts with which the work\r\nbristled, by sciolistic criticisms, bigoted denunciations, or timid,\r\nfaint praise. Conservatives in Politics and Religion exhibited him as a\r\ndangerous innovator, a social iconoclast, the would-be destroyer of all\r\nthat was sacred in Institutions and in Religion. Theologians branded him\r\nas immoral and atheistic, and poured upon him a torrent of vituperation\r\nand hatred.\r\n\r\nThe only public reply which the English writer condescended to make, is\r\ncontained in the closing pages of the fourth chapter of the last volume\r\nwhich he published. Every line of this answer, which is transcribed\r\nbelow, breathes the spirit of Him who, when he was reviled, reviled not\r\nagain--the spirit of forbearance, of generous forgiveness, of\r\nmagnanimity, of unruffled dignity. Buckle had learned, indeed, from his\r\nown investigations, that he who would elevate mankind must expect, not\r\nonly its indifference to his labors, but its positive abuse. He knew,\r\nthat the individual who, like Jesus, attempts to promulgate new truth,\r\neither moral or intellectual, must expect to array against himself the\r\ngreatest portion of the human family, incrusted in their prejudices,\r\ntheir ignorance, their interests, or their feelings, and must be content\r\nwith the appreciation and sympathy of the few who are wise enough to\r\nunderstand him, truthful enough to accept his doctrine, however\r\nunwholesome to their tastes, and brave enough to avow it. Perhaps he had\r\nalso learned the fact, that, in the present state of humanity's\r\ndevelopment, few, very few, even of the best of mankind, love truth,\r\nchiefly _because it is truth_, and are hence eager to know their own\r\nshortcomings; but that those truths only are, for the most part, capable\r\nof being acceptably presented to individuals, which it is more\r\nsatisfactory to their personal feelings, more comfortable to their own\r\ninherent peculiarities of disposition, to conform to than to reject. Be\r\nthis as it may, the reply which he makes to the outrages showered upon\r\nhim is evidently the language of a man whose thoughts are far removed\r\nfrom the arena of petty spite or private resentment, the expression of\r\none who knew the grandeur and usefulness of his labors, who expected, in\r\ntheir prosecution, to be misunderstood and calumniated, and who, yet,\r\nwas incapable of other than the most generous impulses of a noble\r\nphilanthropy toward his maligners and traducers.\r\n\r\nIn the announcement of his inability to fulfil the great promises made\r\nin the former volume, we find, likewise, the indications of a nature\r\nfull of lofty grandeur. He who has known the scholar's hopes, the\r\nstudent's struggles, and the author's ambition, may form some faint\r\nconception of what must have been the feelings of the great Historian\r\nwhen the conviction came to him, first faintly foreshadowed and then\r\ndeepening to a reality, that the prize for which he had contended--and\r\nsuch a prize! which had seemed, too, at times, almost within his\r\ngrasp--was destined forever to elude him. Frankly to acknowledge failure\r\nin such a struggle, was in itself great; to acknowledge it when the\r\ncries of his assailants were still ringing in his ears, and when it\r\nmight have been measurably concealed, was still greater; to acknowledge\r\nit in words which betray no trace of disappointed _personal_ ambition,\r\nbut only a regret that the final avenue to truth should not have been\r\nopened, was heroic even to sublimity. The pages of Buckle's 'History of\r\nCivilization' which record the answer to his traducers and the\r\nacknowledgment of his disappointment in relation to what he should be\r\nable to achieve, will stand in the annals of literary history as a\r\nmemorable instance in which is significantly exhibited one factor of\r\nthat highest religious spirit so much needed in our day--_devotion to\r\nthe intellectual discovery of all truth for truth's sake_.\r\n\r\nThe following is the passage in question:\r\n\r\n     'In the moral world, as in the physical world, nothing is\r\n     anomalous; nothing is unnatural; nothing is strange. All is order,\r\n     symmetry, and law. There are opposites, but there are no\r\n     contradictions. In the character of a nation, inconsistency is\r\n     impossible. Such, however, is still the backward condition of the\r\n     human mind, and with so evil and jaundiced an eye do we approach\r\n     the greatest problems, that not only common writers, but even men\r\n     from whom better things might be hoped, are on this point involved\r\n     in constant confusion. Perplexing themselves and their readers by\r\n     speaking of inconsistency, as if it were a quality belonging to the\r\n     subject which they investigate, instead of being, as it really is,\r\n     a measure of their own ignorance. It is the business of the\r\n     historian to remove this ignorance by showing that the movements of\r\n     nations are perfectly regular, and that, like all other movements,\r\n     they are solely determined by their antecedents. If he cannot do\r\n     this, he is no historian. He may be an annalist, or a biographer,\r\n     or a chronicler, but higher than that he cannot rise, unless he is\r\n     imbued with that spirit of science which teaches, as an article of\r\n     faith, the doctrine of uniform sequence; in other words, the\r\n     doctrine that certain events having already happened, certain other\r\n     events corresponding to them will also happen. To seize this idea\r\n     with firmness, and to apply it on all occasions, without listening\r\n     to any exceptions, is extremely difficult, but it must be done by\r\n     whoever wishes to elevate the study of history from its present\r\n     crude and informal state, and do what he may toward placing it in\r\n     its proper rank, as the head and chief of all the sciences. Even\r\n     then, he cannot perform his task unless his materials are ample,\r\n     and derived from sources of unquestioned credibility. But if his\r\n     facts are sufficiently numerous; if they are very diversified; if\r\n     they have been collected from such various quarters that they can\r\n     check and confront each other, so as to do away with all suspicion\r\n     of their testimony being garbled; and if he who uses them possesses\r\n     that faculty of generalization, without which nothing great can be\r\n     achieved, he will hardly fail in bringing some part of his labors\r\n     to a prosperous issue, provided he devotes all his strength to that\r\n     one enterprise, postponing to it every other object of ambition,\r\n     and sacrificing to it many interests which men hold dear. Some of\r\n     the most pleasurable incentives to action, he must disregard. Not\r\n     for him are those rewards which in other pursuits the same energy\r\n     would have earned; not for him, the sweets of popular applause; not\r\n     for him, the luxury of power; not for him, a share in the councils\r\n     of his country; not for him a conspicuous and honored place before\r\n     the public eye. Albeit, conscious of what he could do, he may not\r\n     compete in the great contest; he cannot hope to win the prize; he\r\n     cannot even enjoy the excitement of the struggle. To him the arena\r\n     is closed. His recompense lies within himself, and he must learn to\r\n     care little for the sympathy of his fellow creatures, or for such\r\n     honors as they are able to bestow. So far from looking for these\r\n     things, he should rather be prepared for that obloquy which always\r\n     awaits those, who, by opening up new veins of thought, disturb the\r\n     prejudices of their contemporaries. While ignorance, and worse than\r\n     ignorance, is imputed to him, while his motives are misrepresented\r\n     and his integrity impeached, while he is accused of denying the\r\n     value of moral principles, and of attacking the foundation of all\r\n     religion, as if he were some public enemy, who made it his business\r\n     to corrupt society, and whose delight it was to see what evil he\r\n     could do; while these charges are brought forward, and repeated\r\n     from mouth to mouth, he must be capable of pursuing in silence the\r\n     even tenor of his way, without swerving, without pausing, and\r\n     without stepping from his path to notice the angry outcries which\r\n     he cannot but hear, and which he is more than human if he does not\r\n     long to rebuke. These are the qualities, and these the high\r\n     resolves, indispensable to him who, on the most important of all\r\n     subjects, believing that the old road is worn out and useless,\r\n     seeks to strike out a new one for himself, and, in the effort, not\r\n     only perhaps exhausts his strength, but is sure to incur the enmity\r\n     of those who are bent on maintaining the ancient scheme unimpaired.\r\n     To solve the great problem of affairs; to detect those hidden\r\n     circumstances which determine the march and destiny of nations; and\r\n     to find, in the events of the past, a key to the proceedings of the\r\n     future, is nothing less than to unite into a single science all the\r\n     laws of the moral and physical world. Whoever does this, will build\r\n     up afresh the fabric of our knowledge, rearrange its various\r\n     parts, and harmonize its apparent discrepancies. Perchance, the\r\n     human mind is hardly ready for so vast an enterprise. At all\r\n     events, he who undertakes it will meet with little sympathy, and\r\n     will find few to help him. And let him toil as he may, the sun and\r\n     noontide of his life shall pass by, the evening of his days shall\r\n     overtake him, and he himself have to quit the scene, leaving that\r\n     unfinished which he had vainly hoped to complete. He may lay the\r\n     foundation; it will be for his successors to raise the edifice.\r\n     Their hands will give the last touch; they will reap the glory;\r\n     their names will be remembered when his is forgotten.\r\n\r\n     'It is, indeed, too true, that such a work requires, not only\r\n     several minds, but also the successive experience of several\r\n     generations. Once, I own, I thought otherwise. Once, when I first\r\n     caught sight of the whole field of knowledge, and seemed, however\r\n     dimly, to discern its various parts, and the relation they bore to\r\n     each other, I was so entranced with its surpassing beauty, that the\r\n     judgment was beguiled, and I deemed myself able, not only to cover\r\n     the surface, but also to master the details. Little did I know how\r\n     the horizon enlarges as well as recedes, and how vainly we grasp at\r\n     the fleeting forms, which melt away and elude us in the distance.\r\n     Of all that I had hoped to do, I now find but too surely how small\r\n     a part I shall accomplish. In those early aspirations, there was\r\n     much that was fanciful; perhaps there was much that was foolish.\r\n     Perhaps, too, they contained a moral defect, and savored of an\r\n     arrogance which belongs to a strength that refuses to recognize its\r\n     own weakness. Still, even now that they are defeated and brought to\r\n     nought, I cannot repent having indulged in them, but, on the\r\n     contrary, I would willingly recall them if I could. For, such hopes\r\n     belong to that joyous and sanguine period of life, when alone we\r\n     are really happy; when the emotions are more active than the\r\n     judgment; when experience has not yet hardened our nature; when the\r\n     affections are not yet blighted and nipped to the core; and when\r\n     the bitterness of disappointment not having yet been felt,\r\n     difficulties are unheeded, obstacles are unseen, ambition is a\r\n     pleasure instead of a pang, and the blood coursing swiftly through\r\n     the veins, the pulse beats high, while the heart throbs at the\r\n     prospect of the future. Those are glorious days; but they go from\r\n     us, and nothing can compensate their absence. To me, they now seem\r\n     more like the visions of a disordered fancy than the sober\r\n     realities of things that were, and are not. It is painful to make\r\n     this confession; but I owe it to the reader, because I would not\r\n     have him to suppose that either in this or in the future volumes of\r\n     my History I shall be able to redeem my pledge, and to perform all\r\n     that I promised. Something I hope to achieve which will interest\r\n     the thinkers of this age; and, something, perhaps, on which\r\n     posterity may build. It will, however, only be a fragment of my\r\n     original design.'\r\n\r\nIn estimating the extent to which Mr. Buckle succeeded in consummating\r\nthe labor which he undertook, we are not, therefore, to measure his\r\nresults by the standard of the first, but by that of the second volume.\r\nIt is not, then, the Science of History which he is striving to write;\r\nbut only something 'which will interest the thinkers of this age, and\r\nsomething, perhaps, on which posterity may build.' His task, as thus\r\nabridged, was confined to the endeavor to establish the 'four leading\r\npropositions, which, according to my [his] view, are to be deemed the\r\nbasis of the history of civilization;' that is, the basis of a Science\r\nof History. These propositions, given in a previous article, may be here\r\nrepeated:\r\n\r\n     '1st. That the progress of mankind depends on the success with\r\n     which the laws of phenomena are investigated, and on the extent to\r\n     which a knowledge of those laws is diffused. 2d. That before such\r\n     investigation can begin, a spirit of scepticism must arise, which,\r\n     at first aiding the investigation, is afterward aided by it. 3d.\r\n     That the discoveries thus made, increase the influence of\r\n     intellectual truths, and diminish, relatively, not absolutely, the\r\n     influence of moral truths; moral truths being more stationary than\r\n     intellectual truths, and receiving fewer additions. 4th. That the\r\n     great enemy of this movement, and therefore the great enemy of\r\n     civilization, is the protective spirit; by which I mean the notion\r\n     that society cannot prosper unless the affairs of life are watched\r\n     over and protected at nearly every turn by the state and the\r\n     church; the state teaching men what to do, and the church teaching\r\n     them what they are to believe.'\r\n\r\nIn the first paper of this series, which was devoted to the examination\r\nof the third proposition as announced by Mr. Buckle and substantially\r\naffirmed by Professor Draper, together with the consideration of the\r\nfundamental Law of Human Progress, the error into which both of these\r\ndistinguished writers had fallen in regard to the relative influence of\r\nmoral and intellectual truths, was pointed out; as also the\r\nmisconception under which they rested concerning the Law of Human\r\nDevelopment. This misconception, it was then shown, arose from an\r\nincorrect understanding of the essential character of the Law itself,\r\nand could be traced, basically, to the same source whence sprang their\r\nmistake in reference to the comparative power of moral and mental\r\nforces. It is to a misapprehension, analogous to that which brought him\r\ninto error concerning these two important points, that the radical\r\ndefect of Mr. Buckle's first and fourth propositions is to be traced, as\r\nwill be hereafter exhibited.\r\n\r\nThe complete and exhaustive consideration of the second proposition\r\ndemands a range of Metaphysical examination which cannot be entered upon\r\nat this time. For our present purposes it may be dismissed with the\r\nfollowing remarks:\r\n\r\nThat before men begin the investigation of any subject _deliberately_,\r\n_reflectively_, and with a _fixed_ and _intelligent_ purpose of\r\nascertaining the truth concerning it, there must arise some feeling of\r\ndoubt in their minds in relation to the given subject or to some details\r\nof it, is certainly true, and needed no array of evidence to prove it;\r\nbut that prior to such _conscious_ and _intentional_ effort at\r\nexploration, there exists an _unconscious_ or _automatic_ action in the\r\nmind, an instinctual and passive kind of thinking, a vague floating of\r\nideas _into_ the mental faculties, rather than an apprehension of them\r\nby an active and deliberate _tension_ of the intellect, and that it is\r\nthrough this kind of _intuitive investigation_ that the 'spirit of\r\nscepticism' primarily arises, is equally true; though not, perhaps, at\r\nthe first blush, so apparent. In this sense, the statement of Mr. Buckle\r\nis simply one half of a truism, the other half of which, not enunciated\r\nby him, is equally correct.\r\n\r\nWhether the spirit of scepticism--which then undoubtedly aids in the\r\ninvestigation--_is afterward aided or fostered by it_, depends upon the\r\nnature of the question investigated. If this be one which has hitherto\r\nbeen considered as established upon a basis that was in every respect\r\nright, and if errors are revealed in the process of the examination,\r\nthen, indeed, the spirit of scepticism is strengthened. But if, on the\r\ncontrary, the investigation be in reference to a range of thought which\r\nrests upon a basis that is, in all ways, sound--concerning Mathematical\r\ntruths, for instance--then the sceptical spirit is _not_ aided by it,\r\nbut is, contrariwise, weakened.\r\n\r\nIn respect to the field of inquiry covered by the author of\r\n'Civilization in England,' it was seen that numerous statements had been\r\naccepted as true in early times, which closer scrutiny at a later period\r\nshowed to be erroneous. Hence there came to be a want of confidence in\r\nthe general basis upon which knowledge rested; and, as continued\r\nresearch served to confirm the doubts previously existing, investigation\r\ndid aid, in this great department of thought, covering indeed the entire\r\nhistory of the past, the spirit of scepticism. As a _fact_, therefore,\r\n_in relation to this special sphere of inquiry_, Mr. Buckle's statement\r\nis correct; as a universal _Generalization_ derived from this Fact, it\r\nmay or may not be true, according to the subject of examination to which\r\nit is applied.\r\n\r\nThis proposition is, therefore, like that in relation to the moral and\r\nintellectual elements--as previously shown--and like all Mr. Buckle's\r\nGeneralizations--as will be hereafter shown--a half-truth, a correct\r\nstatement of one side of a verity, good so far as it goes, but\r\nessentially false when put for the whole, as in the present instance, or\r\nwhen held so as to exclude the opposite half-truth.\r\n\r\nIt is this fact, that basic truth is everywhere made up of a _union of\r\nopposites_, each of which seems, at first sight, to exclude the other,\r\nwhich the Historian himself so forcibly expresses when he exclaims: 'In\r\nthe moral world, as in the physical world, nothing is anomalous; nothing\r\nis unnatural; nothing is strange. All is order, symmetry, and law.\r\n_There are opposites, but there are no contradictions.'_ Had he\r\nunderstood the full meaning of this statement of the _inherently\r\nparadoxical nature of truth_, and been able to give the Principle which\r\nit establishes a universal application in unfolding the various domains\r\nof human intelligence and activity, he would have grasped the Knowledge\r\nfor which he vainly strove, would have discovered the veritable Science\r\nof the Sciences, the long-sought Criterion of Truth. In the absence of a\r\nright understanding of this complex fact, that fundamental truth has\r\nalways two sides affirming directly opposite half-truths, he fell into\r\nthe error of mistaking the moiety for the whole, and has left us a world\r\nin which, with all the aid that he has afforded us, we still fail to\r\ndiscern the 'order, symmetry, and law' which undoubtedly pervade all its\r\nparts--a world in which there is still exhibited, so far at least as\r\ngovernmental, religious, and social affairs are concerned, an\r\n'anomalous, strange, and unnatural' aspect.\r\n\r\nSuch consideration as it is feasible to give the first of these\r\nhistorical propositions in these columns, was, for the most part,\r\nincluded in that portion of the examination of the positions of our two\r\nauthors, which was contained in the opening paper of the series; though\r\nno special application of Principles there elaborated was made to this\r\nformula. It was there pointed out, that intellectual forces constitute\r\nonly _one_ of the factors in the sum of human progress, and that _moral_\r\nforces are equally as important, being the second--the opposite and\r\ncomplementary factor. In the light of that exposition, and of the brief\r\nconsideration here given to the second Generalization, it is perceptible\r\nthat the defect in this proposition consists, not in what it affirms,\r\nbut in what it does _not_ affirm. 'That the progress of mankind depends\r\non the success with which the laws of phenomena are investigated, and on\r\nthe extent to which a knowledge of those laws is diffused,' is a\r\nstatement which is undeniably true. It does not, however, contain the\r\n_whole truth_ in relation to the subject of investigation. It is just as\r\ncorrect to say that the progress of mankind depends on the success with\r\nwhich the moral or religious faculties--faculties which instigate\r\ndevotion to our highest perception of right--are cultivated, and on the\r\nextent to which they are practically active. For it is not in the\r\ninculcation of intellectual truth alone, or preëminently, nor in the\r\ncultivation of moral strength alone, or predominantly, that the progress\r\nof mankind is secured; but in the developing vigor of _both_ mental and\r\nmoral forces, and in their mutual coöperation and assistance.\r\n\r\nThe proposition, as announced by Mr. Buckle, is, therefore, either a\r\nhalf-truth, which does not sufficiently explain the cause of 'the\r\nprogress of mankind,' which the Historian avers that it unfolds, or it\r\nis actually false, accordingly as it is understood to state a verity\r\nwhich does not exclude the _affirmative_ statement of an opposite and\r\napparently antagonistic truth, or as it is interpreted to be the\r\nexplanation of the whole or main cause upon which the advancement of\r\nsociety has depended. That the author of 'Civilization in England'\r\nregarded it in this latter light, is plainly apparent. His whole work is\r\nan elaborate attempt to establish the invalid theory, that human\r\nprogress is due _almost exclusively_ to the enlightenment of the\r\nintellect, and in a very minor degree only to the cultivation of the\r\nmoral or religious nature. In a certain sense it is indeed true that\r\n_all_ social elevation is the result of intellectual growth; but it is\r\nonly in that _absolute_ sense in which the Intellect is used for the\r\ntotality of human faculties, and of course includes the moral faculty\r\nitself. In this sense, it is just as true to say that all progress is\r\nthrough the Moral Powers, using this term to include the whole of the\r\nhuman Mind, and consequently the intellectual forces. In either case,\r\nthe question still remains, of the relative effect of the Intellectual\r\nand Moral powers upon the career of humanity, when considered as not\r\nincluding each other. It was in this _relative_ point of view that Mr.\r\nBuckle entertained it.\r\n\r\nWith this cursory examination of the first and second propositions,\r\ntheir distinctive consideration will close. Some things, however, that\r\nwill have to be enunciated in the investigation of the English\r\nHistorian's Generalizations as a whole, are also necessary to a clear\r\nunderstanding of the merits and defects of each one taken singly.\r\nAdditional light will also be thrown upon them in the course of our\r\nanalysis of the fourth proposition, which practically touches more vital\r\nand important questions than are involved in the others. Contrary to\r\nprevious announcement, want of space will prevent the examination of\r\nthis Generalization and of Dr. Draper's work in the present paper.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter this article was put in type, the writer received a letter from a\r\nfriend, a distinguished member of the Positive School, in which occurs\r\nthe following sentence:\r\n\r\n     'I notice in your ... article on 'Buckle, Draper, and a Science of\r\n     History,' one inaccuracy. You say: 'History, while it is the source\r\n     whence the proof of his (Comte's) fundamental positions is drawn,\r\n     finds no place in his scientific schedule.' In the positive\r\n     Hierarchy of Science History _is_ included: it constitutes the\r\n     Dynamic Branch of Sociology. As in the Science of Life, Anatomy\r\n     constitutes Biological Statics and Physiology Biological Dynamics,\r\n     in Sociology we have Social Statics--the Theory of Order, Social\r\n     Dynamics--the Theory of Progress = the Philosophy (Science) of\r\n     History.'\r\n\r\nThe kindly criticism of the writer arises from that fruitful source of\r\nmisunderstanding--a wrong apprehension of terms.\r\n\r\nHistory, as it has been hitherto written, has been--_First_, a narration\r\nof the supposed facts of the past, without any especial attempt to\r\ninvestigate the proximate causes of national characteristics or mundane\r\nprogression. _Secondly_, an account of the life and vicissitudes of\r\nstates and communities, accompanied with an inquiry into the proximate\r\ncauses of national peculiarities. These two Branches of Investigation\r\nhave been included under the common appellation of _History_, when they\r\nrelated to a special portion of the globe; and of _General_ or\r\n_Universal History_ when, theoretically at least, the whole earth was\r\nunder consideration. _Thirdly_, the examination of the past progress of\r\nthe Race, with a view to the discovery of the fundamental Cause or\r\nCauses which control or direct the Evolutions of Time, or the Principles\r\nin accordance with which nations and civilizations have developed. This\r\nDepartment is denominated _The Philosophy of History_. From it are\r\nexcluded all those investigations of an individual or national character\r\nwhich comprise _History_ in the ordinary acceptation of the word.\r\n\r\nSuch a complete and exhaustive consideration of the Facts and Causes of\r\nHuman Progress as would suffice for the construction of a _Science of\r\nHistory_, would necessarily include _all_ the Branches of Inquiry above\r\nmentioned. While, therefore, _History_, as it has been used in these\r\npapers, and as it is especially exhibited in the present one, has had\r\nthis comprehensive signification, the term is not applied by Comte to\r\nany of the Departments of which he treated; and a very different\r\nmeaning, and one much more circumscribed, attaches to the qualified\r\nexpression which he uses in its stead. The Dynamic Branch of Sociology\r\ndoes not appertain, even in his own estimation, to _History_ proper, but\r\nto _The Philosophy of History_, which is the title by which he\r\ndesignates it. Strictly speaking, it does not appertain to that, in any\r\nbroad sense. It is mainly an inquiry into the Theological, Political,\r\nand Social Principles of the Past and Future, and leaves unnoticed many\r\nquestions of equal importance with those discussed, and which, in the\r\nconstitution of a comprehensive _Philosophy of History_, would occupy an\r\nequally important place.\r\n\r\nBut leaving this point aside, it is sufficient to indicate the fact that\r\nComte, in conformity with the plan upon which he proceeded in the\r\ninvestigation of other Departments of the Universe, eliminated from his\r\nHistorical examination all _concrete_ questions, everything relating\r\nprimarily to individuals or nations, or to the causes of their peculiar\r\ndevelopment; on the same ground on which he set aside Botany, Zoology,\r\nMineralogy, etc. In the beginning of his treatise on Social Dynamics, he\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n     'We must avoid confounding the _abstract_ research into the laws of\r\n     social existence with the _concrete_ history of human societies,\r\n     the explanation of which can result only from a very advanced\r\n     knowledge of the whole of these laws. _Our employment of history in\r\n     this inquiry, then, must be essentially abstract._ It would, in\r\n     fact, be history without the names of men, or even of nations, if\r\n     it were not necessary to avoid all such puerile affectation as\r\n     there would be in depriving ourselves of the use of names which may\r\n     elucidate our exposition or consolidate our thought.... Geological\r\n     considerations must enter into such _concrete_ inquiry, and we have\r\n     but little positive knowledge of geology; and the same is true of\r\n     questions of climate, race, etc.'\r\n\r\nAnd again he says, the inquiry is to be conducted 'stripped of all\r\ncircumstances of climate, locality, etc.'\r\n\r\nIt will be sufficiently evident from this brief statement, that _The\r\nPhilosophy of History_ (not _History_, as the letter says) which\r\nconstitutes the Dynamic Branch of Sociology in the Positive System is,\r\nin Comte's own intention and showing, a series of bald abstractions from\r\nwhich the _substantial_ or _concrete_ elements of individual and\r\nnational activity, the proximate causes of Human Progress, are dropped\r\nout; and that _History_ in the ordinary sense of that term, or in the\r\nbroader sense in which it has been used in these papers, as referring to\r\na possible Science, finds no place in his Scientific Schedule.\r\n\r\nThe error into which our critic has fallen, in this case, undoubtedly\r\nresulted in part from the unfortunate confounding of the words\r\n_Philosophy_ and _Science_, which pervades the Positive System.\r\nPhilosophy and Science are not, in any proper use of the terms,\r\nsynonymes. They relate--as it is designed at some future time to\r\nshow--to equally true and important, though _opposite_ aspects of the\r\nUniverse, considered either as a whole or in relation to its parts.\r\nComte, as has been heretofore exhibited, degraded Science from its\r\n_Exact_ and _Certain_ position, in order to include Domains of Inquiry\r\nwhich did not have and to which he could not furnish a truly scientific\r\nbasis. In like manner, after discarding a false Philosophy, unable to\r\ninstitute a true, or at least a sufficiently comprehensive one, on the\r\nfoundation which he had reared, he gave the name of _Positive\r\nPhilosophy_ to his incongruous coordination of Scientific and\r\nUnscientific Departments of Thought. The terms _Science_ and\r\n_Philosophy_, thus wrenched from their legitimate uses, are therefore\r\nloosely understood and indiscriminately applied by the students of his\r\nSystem and the followers of his social theories, in ways which are\r\nproductive of numerous misunderstandings, though not perhaps of\r\nunprofitable criticisms.\r\n\r\nIn a subsequent letter, the same gentleman calls attention to another\r\nsupposed error--the omission of _La Morale_ from the Positive Hierarchy\r\nof Sciences--and adds:\r\n\r\n     'Although this final Science was in a manner involved in Sociology\r\n     as treated in the _Philosophy_, its normal separation was yet a\r\n     step of Capital Importance; sufficiently so to make the enumeration\r\n     of Comte's Theoretical Hierarchy without it equivalent to a\r\n     misrepresentation.'\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of the article in question--the exhibition of the\r\nincongruous, and hence really unscientific character of the\r\nHierarchy--the Positive Scale was given in the paper alluded to, as\r\nstated by Comte himself in the 'Positive Philosophy'--a work which is\r\naccepted as valid, _both_ by the followers of his theories in regard to\r\nScience, and the adopters of his Social Scheme--there being no occasion,\r\nat that time, to indicate the subsequent elevation into a separate\r\nScience, of what there formed a subdivision of Sociology. The after\r\nenumeration of _La Morale_ as a separate Science, in a work which is\r\n_not_ regarded as valid by many of the disciples of the _Positive\r\nPhilosophy_, is, however, exhibited in the present writing, where a more\r\nminute enumeration of the Branches of Inquiry included in the Positive\r\nHierarchy rendered it desirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIARY OF FRANCES KRASINSKA;\r\n\r\nOR, LIFE IN POLAND DURING THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n\r\nSunday, _December 30th, 1760._\r\n\r\nI have finally decided upon going to Maleszow; I may perhaps feel more\r\nat ease there than here. Barbara would accompany me, but the state of\r\nher health will prevent her; her husband says it would be very imprudent\r\nfor her to travel. I have finally received a letter from the prince\r\nroyal; he is in despair at my departure. He is exceedingly irritated\r\nagainst the princess, and fears lest Brühl should disclose all he knows\r\nto the king.\r\n\r\nI must leave here as soon as possible. The happiness surrounding me is a\r\nreal torment. This sweet and quiet joy of a husband and wife who love\r\neach other so tenderly, pierces my heart. This well-arranged household,\r\nthis family union, and all the delicate attentions of the Starost\r\nSwidzinski, who adores my sister--all these blessings, which I must\r\ncovet, and yet of which I am not jealous, increase the bitterness of my\r\nsuffering.\r\n\r\nMy sister is predestined to every possible felicity. Her little girl is\r\nthe most charming child anywhere to be found; her father fondles and\r\ncaresses her, and my parents are always writing to my sister, because\r\nthey feel so much solicitude for her and her little one. Happy Barbara!\r\nLife is one long festival for her. Ah! may God take her happiness into\r\nhis own keeping, and may this reflection console me under my own weight\r\nof sorrow!\r\n\r\nI shall perhaps feel more tranquil when I have seen my dear parents;\r\ntheir pardon will be as a Christian absolution for me. I will again\r\nlive and hope when protected by their tenderness. I will begin the new\r\nyear with them; it may perhaps be the dawn of my happiness! I was\r\nformerly so happy at Maleszow....\r\n\r\n\r\nCASTLE OF MALESZOW, _January 5th, 1761._\r\n\r\nI have been here several days, but I think I will soon return to\r\nSulgostow. I suffer everywhere, and it always seems to me that I will be\r\nmost happy in whatever place I am not. My lot is brilliant in\r\nimagination, but miserable in reality. And yet, my parents have received\r\nme well, and have treated me with the greatest kindness. But a matter of\r\ncomparatively slight importance is one of the causes of my uneasiness\r\nhere: I have no money; I cannot make the slightest present to my\r\nsisters, and can give nothing to the people of the castle.\r\n\r\nWhen I was with the princess, she provided for all my wants, and gave me\r\nbesides a small sum every month; I could save nothing, nor indeed could\r\nI anticipate any cause for doing so. I now find myself in the most\r\ncomplete state of destitution, and would rather die than ask for money\r\nfrom my husband or my parents, who of course think that I am abundantly\r\nprovided for. When Barbara returned from the school of the Holy\r\nSacrament, she doubtless had much less money than I spent during my\r\nsojourn in Warsaw, and yet she made a small gift to every one. She was\r\nnot, as I, bowed down beneath the weight of melancholy thoughts; her\r\nspirit was free and her heart was joyous. She could think of others, and\r\noffer the labor of her own hands when more costly presents were\r\nwanting.... But I, unquiet, agitated, passing alternately from the most\r\nactual and positive grief to fears still more terrible, cannot apply\r\nmyself a single moment.\r\n\r\nFormerly, when I was happy through hope, and when all life seemed to me\r\none brilliant illusion, I fancied that when I should return to Maleszow\r\nafter my marriage, I would be followed by as long a train as a queen; I\r\nforgot no one in my dreams; all had their share in my royal favors....\r\nAh! what a fearful contrast between my desires and the reality!\r\n\r\nI have not passed a single day since I came here without shedding tears.\r\nWhen I first saw my parents I wished to throw myself at their feet; but\r\nmy father prevented me, and, treating me as if I were a stranger, made\r\nme a profound bow. Whenever I enter the saloon, he rises and will not\r\nsit near me; the homage he considers due to my dignity as princess royal\r\noverpowers his paternal tenderness.\r\n\r\nThis formal etiquette causes me inconceivable torment! Ah! if honors are\r\nto cost me so dear, I would a thousand times prefer to be only a simple\r\nnoble.\r\n\r\nThe first dinner I ate with the family was ceremonious and cold. My\r\nmother was uneasy and ready to apologize for offering me the ordinary\r\nfare of the castle, and my father whispered in my ear:\r\n\r\n'I might have offered you a bottle of wine, drawn from the tun of Miss\r\nFrances; it would have been very pleasant for me to have drunk it at our\r\nfirst dinner, but custom requires that the father should drink the first\r\nglass, and the husband the second; otherwise it would be a bad omen....\r\nWill that day ever come?' he added, sighing.\r\n\r\nI could not restrain my tears, and could neither speak nor eat; my\r\nmother looked at me with the most tender compassion. Every moment here\r\nbrings me some new sorrow, and the bonmots of our little Matthias have\r\nlost all power to divert me. My father makes signs to him with his eyes\r\nthat he may invent something witty, but it is all lost upon me. Music to\r\na suffering body is but an importunate noise; and sallies of wit to a\r\ndespairing soul have lost their savor.\r\n\r\nOur little Matthias is inconceivably acute; he divines all. He knows my\r\nposition, I am quite sure. He took advantage yesterday of a moment when\r\nI was quite alone to come into my room, and with an air half sad, half\r\njesting, he knelt down before me and drew from his pocket a little\r\nbouquet of dried flowers tied with a white ribbon and fastened by a gold\r\npin.... I could not at first tell what he meant, but soon the bouquet I\r\nhad worn at Barbara's wedding flashed across my memory. He gave me the\r\nflowers, saying: 'I am sometimes a prophet,' and, still on his knees,\r\nwent toward the door. I ran after him; I remembered all, and with the\r\nremembrance came a crowd of feelings, at once sweet and bitter. This\r\nbouquet was the same I had given Matthias on Barbara's wedding day....\r\n\r\nI took a rich diamond pin from my dress, and fastened it at the\r\nbuttonhole of Matthias's coat. Neither he nor I spoke a single word, but\r\nI am sure that while each wondered inwardly at the strange fulfilment of\r\nthe prophecy, each was still more surprised that it had realized none of\r\nour hopes.\r\n\r\nJust as I was writing these lines, my mother entered my room. Her\r\nkindness is incomparable; she brought me such a quantity of stuffs, of\r\njewels and blondes, that she could scarcely carry them. She laid them on\r\nmy bed, and said:\r\n\r\n'I give you a portion of the trousseau destined to my daughters; I\r\nshould have added many other articles, but I was afraid they were not\r\nhandsome enough, and yet I have given you the best I had. I have spoken\r\nto my husband, and he has determined to sell two villages to make a\r\ntrousseau worthy of so illustrious a union. That will come when the\r\nsecret is unveiled.'\r\n\r\nI burst into tears, and would have thrown myself at her feet, but she\r\nprevented me, and asked me a thousand pardons for presenting me with\r\nthings of so little value.\r\n\r\nOh, yes! I must certainly leave here day after to-morrow. I suffer\r\nbeyond expression. My younger sisters, madame, the courtiers, and even\r\nthe old servants exclaim over the change which has come upon me, and ask\r\none another why I am not yet married, and why no one seems to think of\r\nhaving me married.\r\n\r\nThe three girls whom I was to take into my service came to see me;\r\ndoubtless, to remind me of my promise. Our old Hyacinth himself brought\r\nhis daughter to me. Every one I see causes me some new sorrow or\r\nvexation. Ah! how astonished they would be if they knew of my marriage!\r\nAnd these poor people who relied upon my protection, I cannot take them\r\ninto my service, because I have married a prince, the son of a king!\r\n\r\nSULGOSTOW, Wednesday, _January 9th._\r\n\r\nI am again with my sister. On my arrival, I found no letter from the\r\nprince royal. He may be ill! Or, perhaps, the king has been informed of\r\nour marriage, and has placed him under strict surveillance. If the\r\nprince palatine were in Warsaw, he would surely have written to me; I\r\ncan rely upon his devotion. As for Prince Martin, I thank him for his\r\nlight-headedness, and am very glad that he forgets me.\r\n\r\nMy parents' parting farewell did me much more good than their reception;\r\nat that moment, I again found all their former tenderness.\r\n\r\nBefore I left, I went to Lissow, and visited the curate in his\r\npresbytery. When I came, he was planting cypress trees in his garden,\r\nand he promised me to plant one in memory of me in the cemetery. I will\r\nleave behind me this melancholy remembrancer. His words to me were very\r\nkind and consoling. As I left him, I experienced a moment of real calm\r\nand resignation.\r\n\r\nTuesday, _January 15th._\r\n\r\nDuring the last few days I have been forced to struggle against new\r\npersecutions. Just as we were about sitting down to table, the sound of\r\nthe trumpet announced the arrival of a stranger, and soon after, the\r\ndouble door of the dining hall was thrown open, and M. Borch, the king's\r\nminister, was announced.\r\n\r\nI at once divined the motive of this visit, and my heart throbbed as if\r\nit would burst. M. Borch, like a real diplomatist, tried to give his\r\nvisit the appearance of a simple courtesy. Remembering the gracious\r\nreception offered him at Barbara's wedding, he came, he said, to offer\r\nhis homage to her ladyship the Starostine Swidzinska, and renew his\r\nacquaintance with the starost. During dinner, many compliments were\r\nexchanged; but as soon as the dessert was over and the court had\r\nretired, he invited me to go with him into the starost's private\r\ncabinet, and said to me:\r\n\r\n'Brühl and I know your secret, madame, and I can assure you we have been\r\nexceedingly diverted; for you may well believe that we regard this\r\nmarriage as a mere jest, a real child's play: the benediction given by a\r\npriest not belonging to the parish, and without the knowledge of the\r\nparents, can never be valid. This marriage then will soon be broken, and\r\nwith very little trouble, I can assure you.'\r\n\r\nThese words fell upon me like a thunderbolt, and without a superhuman\r\ncourage and the aid of Heaven, I should have been crushed at once; but I\r\nfelt that the fate of my whole life might depend upon that moment.\r\nBorch's character was well known to me; I knew him to be as cowardly as\r\nbase, and also that strength of will is all powerful with such men, who\r\nare only bold with the weak. I replied:\r\n\r\n'Sir, your cunning lacks skill; your diplomacy and that of Minister\r\nBrühl, come to nought through the simple good sense of a woman. Your\r\nworld, which judges me and deems me devoid of courage and reason, only\r\nexcites my pity; I am ready for a struggle with you and with Brühl. My\r\nmarriage is valid; it has been blessed by the consent of my parents; I\r\nhold my powers from God, and will be able to defend them. The bishop was\r\naware of this marriage on which you are pleased to throw the anathema of\r\nyour irony; the curate of my own parish gave us the benediction, and two\r\nwitnesses assisted us during the holy ceremony. I know that divorce is\r\npossible, but only through the common consent of both parties, and the\r\nprince royal, my husband, and myself, will never consent to it.'\r\n\r\nBorch's astonishment may easily be imagined, and even I could not have\r\nbelieved myself capable of so much energy. Borch expected to find a\r\nchild whom he could dazzle with a few promises; he thought he could\r\neasily bring me to a renunciation of my rights, and that I would readily\r\nconsent to sign the instrument of my own shame and sorrow: he found me\r\nmost determined. He remained here two days, and again renewed his\r\nattempts, but, finding that I persisted in my refusal, he departed,\r\nhaving however previously asked me if I would consent to a divorce in\r\ncase the prince royal should deem it necessary.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' I replied, 'but you must first show me a writing to that effect,\r\nsigned by the prince himself.'\r\n\r\nI feared lest this occurrence should be the cause of a new sorrow:\r\nBarbara's situation requires so much care, and she feels my troubles so\r\ndeeply! I was really alarmed lest her health should suffer, but, thank\r\nGod! she feels quite well. Dear Barbara is another me; alas! all who\r\nlove me must accept the chalice of misery! The starost was quite uneasy\r\nconcerning his wife; they are so happy together, so tenderly united!...\r\nAnd I, what a sad destiny is mine! I have obtained neither repose, nor\r\nhappiness, nor those objects of ambition which I would have consented to\r\nreceive from the hand of love.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere ends the Diary of Frances Krasinska. Her thoughts were too sad,\r\nher memories too bitter, to bear being transferred to paper. When sorrow\r\nin all its bitterness has seized upon the soul, we can no longer see or\r\nhear without a shudder certain words which formerly excited reveries\r\nmore or less sweet and seductive within our souls. Frances lost all her\r\nillusions, one by one; she was strong enough to bear up against\r\ninjustice, but she was powerless against her husband's indifference.\r\n\r\nMy readers may perhaps have accused her of ambition; and yet she loved\r\nhim; but love is not always absolute devotion and self-abnegation; love\r\nis not always a virtue; it is often the result of egotism; it is, as\r\nMadame de Staël says, one personality in two persons, or a mere double\r\npersonality. Frances loved the prince royal, but not the less had she\r\nbeen dazzled by his rank.\r\n\r\nShe remained a long time at Sulgostow after Borch's departure. Barbara\r\nSwidzinska, already the mother of one daughter, bore also a son, and\r\nanother daughter, who was named Frances. The tenderness, care, and\r\nattention which Frances experienced in her own family could not console\r\nher for the prince royal's desertion. Her sister was the only being in\r\nthe world to whom she confided her grief; women have a delicate\r\nsensibility which enables them to comprehend the minutest details;\r\nnothing escapes them, and, with the finest instruments in their\r\npossession, they can more readily deal with a crushed heart. If love had\r\nleft Frances a single hope, she might still have found happiness in\r\nfriendship.\r\n\r\nNowhere at rest, she sometimes left Sulgostow for the convent of the\r\nHoly Sacrament in Warsaw; but solitude could not restore her peace, and\r\nher prayers were one cry of despair sent up to God to implore death.\r\n\r\nThe genius of sorrow is the most prolific of all spirits, it seems as if\r\nhuman nature were infinite in nothing but in the power to suffer. There\r\nwas still another grief in store for Frances, another wound for her\r\nafflicted soul; she lost her parents, lost them before they had bestowed\r\nthe name of son upon their daughter's husband. At this time she went to\r\nthe Franciscan convent in Cracow, whither Barbara sent her her young\r\ndaughter Angelica, to endeavor to bind her to earth through the\r\ninfluence of this innocent and youthful affection.\r\n\r\nShe lived also at Cznestochowa or at Opole, and everywhere received\r\norders not to disclose her marriage. At long intervals of time, the\r\nprince royal came to see her, and thus accomplished an external duty of\r\nconscience: total desertion and forgetfulness would perhaps have been\r\npreferable.\r\n\r\nThe prophecy made by the little Matthias was finally verified: the ducal\r\ncrown and the throne of Poland both slipped from Prince Charles's grasp;\r\nBiren was named Duke of Courland, and, when Augustus III. died (at\r\nDresden, October 5th, 1763), he was succeeded by Stanislaus Augustus\r\nPoniatowski.\r\n\r\nTo quiet the uneasiness and the melancholy suspicions of Frances, the\r\nprince royal declared to her that through regard for his father's\r\nadvanced age he must continue to conceal his marriage. But many years\r\npassed after the king's death without bringing any amelioration or\r\nchange in the position of Frances; the prince and the royal family lived\r\nin Dresden, while the prince's wife was constrained to hide her real\r\nname in obscurity.\r\n\r\nThe Lubomirski family did all in their power to obtain a recognition of\r\nFrances's rights; they even appealed to the Empress Maria Theresa.\r\nPrince Charles finally yielded; he wrote a most tender letter to his\r\nwife, begging her to come to him in Dresden; this letter found her at\r\nOpole, and the Lubomirski advised her to await another advance from the\r\nprince before she consented to go to Dresden, which she did.\r\n\r\nPrince Charles, like all men who are impassioned through their fancies\r\nand cold at heart, was irritated at Frances's hesitation, and wrote her\r\nanother letter still more pressing and affectionate; she resisted no\r\nlonger, as one may well believe; but she found neither happiness nor the\r\nrank she was entitled to occupy, or rather, the honor due to her rank.\r\nUnprovided with a revenue suited to her position, she led a life of\r\nprivation, almost of want. The Empress Maria Theresa, touched with\r\ncompassion at her melancholy fate, conferred upon her the county of\r\nLanckorona, near Cracow. This possession, coming from a strange hand,\r\ncould not satisfy her ambition, and her heart must long before have\r\nrenounced every hope of happiness.\r\n\r\nShe maintained a constant correspondence with her sister and the other\r\nmembers of her family in Poland.\r\n\r\nWe will here give the letter which she wrote to her sister before her\r\ndeparture for Dresden, translating it scrupulously from the Polish, and\r\nunderlining [italicizing] the portions originally written in French:\r\n\r\n\r\n     I shall not see you again, as I can no longer delay, my husband\r\n     having fixed the very day for my arrival in Dresden. In his second\r\n     letter, he impresses on me not to be later than the fifth of\r\n     January. I must then say farewell, and rest assured that I return\r\n     with my whole soul the affection you feel for me; always, and in\r\n     whatever place I may be, _you will be the dearest to me, and the\r\n     tokens of your remembrance, the most satisfactory to my heart_.\r\n\r\n     Write to me often, I beg you, and rely upon my punctuality in\r\n     replying.\r\n\r\n     I am going where I hope to find a little repose.... Alas! I no\r\n     longer expect happiness, for the elector will not concede me my\r\n     rank as princess royal, nor recognize me as the wife of the prince.\r\n     He desires, that is to say, he commands me to preserve my\r\n     _incognito_, while in his estates. The prince royal is truly\r\n     grieved, and of all my sorrows the most bitter is that of my\r\n     husband; his health is visibly failing.\r\n\r\n     I will write you a faithful account of all that happens to me; you\r\n     shall know how I am received and the progress of all my affairs. If\r\n     they will be willing to decree us an augmented allowance, I will\r\n     beg my husband to permit me to leave Dresden and settle in some\r\n     foreign country contiguous to Saxony, that I may readily hold\r\n     communication with him. Do not mention my project to any one, for\r\n     if it were known in Saxony, _my whole enterprise would be ruined.\r\n     Adieu, most tenderly loved sister_. Do not forget me. Farewell, the\r\n     multiplicity of my occupations will not permit me to write at\r\n     greater length. _Apropos, I beg you_ to go now and see the princess\r\n     palatiness; you will find her with the Bishop of Kamieniec, and\r\n     Kulagowski; _she will be very grateful for this attention from you;\r\n     it must be agreeable to her_; you will brighten a little the\r\n     gravity of this trio. _Adieu, I embrace you with all my heart, and\r\n     am, as ever, your most affectionate and attached sister,_\r\n                                                             FRANCES.\r\n\r\n     _A thousand tender and friendly messages to your husband; I conjure\r\n     him always to retain a place for me in his memory._\r\n\r\nIn 1776 the Polish diet assigned large pensions to all the heirs of\r\nAugustus III.; the half of that bestowed upon Prince Charles was\r\nrevertible during her lifetime to his wife, the princess royal, Frances\r\nKrasinska.\r\n\r\nDuring her sojourn in Dresden, she gave birth to a daughter, the\r\nPrincess Mary; she educated her with the greatest care, but was soon\r\nforced to leave her; her many sorrows developed an insidious malady,\r\nwhich finally proved fatal. She died on the 30th of April, 1796, aged\r\nfifty-three.\r\n\r\nMadame Moszynska, who had shown herself a friend to Frances in her\r\nprosperity, and, what is still more rare, also in adversity, was\r\ngrievously afflicted by her death. It was she who announced it to\r\nMadame Angelica Szymanowska, born Swidzinska, whom Frances had held at\r\nthe baptismal font with the prince royal in the cathedral church at\r\nWarsaw, in 1760.\r\n\r\nDRESDEN, _June 8th, 1796._\r\n\r\nI comply with your request, madame, but with extreme grief; the loss you\r\nhave sustained is a most cruel one to me; indeed it is the deepest\r\naffliction I have ever known. The princess royal's malady began about\r\ntwo years ago. She then felt pains in her breast; some physicians said\r\nher disease was cancer, while others assured her it was tumor.\r\n\r\nAn incision was then made, and she was better during some time. But the\r\ndisease soon made the most fearful progress. The inflammation appeared\r\nupon the outside, and she felt the most acute pains in her breast and\r\nthroughout the whole length of her arm. She patiently endured the most\r\nexcruciating torments. Having tried various modes of treatment without\r\nexperiencing any relief, she finally consented to make trial of a new\r\ncure. During twelve weeks she saw no one except the members of her own\r\nhousehold and the physicians, who sometimes said she was better and\r\nsometimes that she was worse; finally, however, fever set in,\r\naccompanied by all the signs of consumption.\r\n\r\nPerfectly aware of her condition, she prepared for death with\r\nresignation and devotion; she died during the night of the 30th of\r\nApril. Her breast had burst open several weeks before. An examination\r\nwas made after her death, and many causes for her last illness were\r\ndiscovered; but I cannot dwell upon these details.... In my opinion, and\r\nI followed the whole course of her malady, her chest was seriously\r\naffected in addition to the cancer.\r\n\r\nWe have experienced an irreparable loss; I can scarcely endure life\r\nsince our misfortune, and will never be able to think of the princess\r\nroyal without the most bitter regret. I have not yet seen her husband;\r\nsome say that he is ill, and cannot long survive his wife, but others\r\nspeak of him as quite well: I know not whom to believe.\r\n\r\nI sometimes see their daughter, the Princess Mary, whom I love with all\r\nmy heart, but whom I can only visit once during the week. She is\r\ncharming, and already gives promise of a noble character. The princess\r\nroyal, during her dying moments, left her under the protection of\r\nElizabeth, the king's daughter and the prince royal's sister. Elizabeth\r\nis warmly interested in the young princess, and sincerely attached to\r\nher brother; she is a highly meritorious personage.\r\n\r\nMay I beg you, madame, to continue toward me your previous sentiments of\r\nkindness, and to accept the expression of my unbounded esteem.\r\n                                                        L. MOSZYNSKA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe prince royal, Charles, survived his wife several months, and their\r\ndaughter, still very young, was confided to the guardianship of Prince\r\nCharles's sister. When she reached a marriageable age, she wedded Prince\r\nCarignan, of Savoy, and their descendants are now allied to the reigning\r\nfamily of Sardinia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPETROLEUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nLucian of Samosata is responsible for the strange story of Minerva--how\r\nJupiter commanded Vulcan to split open his skull with a sharp axe, and\r\nhow the warlike virgin leaped in full maturity from the cleft in the\r\nbrain, thoroughly armed and ready for deeds of martial daring,\r\nbrandishing her glittering weapons with fiery energy, and breaking at\r\nonce into the wild Pyrrhic dance. We refer to this myth, bearing, as it\r\ndoubtless does, an important moral in its bosom, as suggestive of the\r\nsudden and gigantic proportions of a traffic which has recently loomed\r\nup in the region of Western Pennsylvania. The petroleum trade has worn\r\nno swaddling bands, acknowledged no leading strings, but sprung at once\r\ninto full maturity. In less than one year from the moment of its\r\ninception, it has fairly eclipsed the Whale Fishery, gray with time, and\r\nstrong through the energy and vigor with which it has ever been\r\nprosecuted. And who can measure its extent in the future, since it can\r\nonly be limited by the sources of the supply flowing in the depths of\r\nthe laboratories of the Great Chemist?\r\n\r\nPetroleum, in some form or other of its various developments, is no new\r\nsubstance in the world's history. More than two thousand years before\r\nthe Christian era, we read of its existence in the days of the builders\r\nof Babel, when men sought to realize the dreams of the Titans, and would\r\nscale heaven itself in their insane folly. It may have been used in the\r\nbuilding of the ark. Herodotus informs us it was largely used in the\r\nconstruction of the walls and towers of Babylon. Diodorus Siculus\r\nconfirms this testimony. Great quantities of it were found on the banks\r\nof the river Issus, one of the tributaries of the Euphrates, in the form\r\nof asphaltum. By its aid were reared those mighty walls and hanging\r\ngardens which filled the heart of Nebuchadnezzar with such a dream of\r\npride as he exclaimed: 'Is this not great Babylon that I have built?'\r\n\r\nAnd from those days so ancient, when history would be dim and obscure,\r\nwere it not for the light of inspiration on the sacred page, down to the\r\npresent time, petroleum has occupied a place in the arrangements of man,\r\neither as an article of utility or luxury. It has been one of God's\r\ngreat gifts to his creatures, designed for their happiness, but kept\r\ntreasured up in His secret laboratory, and developed only in accordance\r\nwith their necessities. And now, in our own days, and in these ends of\r\nthe earth, the great Treasure House has been unlocked, the seal broken,\r\nand the supply furnished most bountifully.\r\n\r\nThe oil region of Western Pennsylvania is the portion of oil-producing\r\nterritory that now occupies the largest share of attention. It is\r\nconfined principally to the valley of Oil Creek, a tributary of the\r\nAlleghany River, which it enters at a point about sixty miles south from\r\nLake Erie. It is true that oil wells are successfully worked on the\r\nbanks of the Alleghany for some distance above and below the mouth of\r\nOil Creek: still the county of Venango has monopolized almost the whole\r\nnumber of oil-producing wells in this region.\r\n\r\nThere are some strange facts, that point to a history all unwritten save\r\nin some few brief sentences in pits and excavations, of oil operations\r\nalong the Oil Valley. These detached fragments, like the remains of the\r\nSibylline Oracles, but cause us to regret more earnestly the loss of the\r\nvolumes which contained the whole. A grand and wonderful history has\r\nbeen that of this American continent, but it has never been graven in\r\nthe archives of time. The actors in its bygone scenes have passed away\r\nin their shadowy grandeur, leaving but dim footprints here and there to\r\ntell us they have been, and cause us to wonder at the mystery which\r\nveils their record, and to muse upon the evanescent glory of man's\r\nearthly destiny.\r\n\r\nAlong the valley of Oil Creek are clear traces of ancient oil\r\noperations. Over sections embracing hundreds of acres in extent, the\r\nentire surface of the land has, at some remote period of time, been\r\nexcavated in the form of oblong pits, from four by six to six by eight\r\nfeet in size. These pits are oftentimes from four to five feet still\r\nin depth, notwithstanding the action of rain and frost during the lapse\r\nof so many years. They are found in the oil region, and over the oil\r\ndeposits, and in no other locality, affording unmistakable evidence of\r\ntheir design and use. The deeper pits appear to have been cribbed up at\r\nthe sides with rough timber, in order to preserve their form and render\r\nthem more available for the design in view. Upon the septa that divide\r\nthem, and even in the pits themselves, trees have grown up more than one\r\nand a half feet in diameter, indicating an antiquity antedating the\r\nearliest records of civilized life in this region. For centuries has\r\nthis treasure been affording intimations of its presence. Before\r\nColumbus had touched these western shores was it gathered here, in this\r\nvalley, as an article of utility or luxury, by the processes of design\r\nand labor, and with the idea of traffic and emolument.\r\n\r\nBy whom were these excavations planned and these pits fashioned, that\r\ntell of the pursuit of wealth so many centuries ago? Let the mighty\r\ndead, that are slumbering in our valleys, and the remains of whose\r\nfortifications and cities are spread out all over the great West, in\r\nmagnificence as vast and gorgeous as the ruins of Nineveh and Babylon,\r\narise and speak, for they alone of mortals can tell!\r\n\r\nFrom the fact that some of these pits have been cribbed with timber\r\nbearing marks of the axe in its adjustment, many have supposed that\r\ntheir construction was due to the French, who at one time occupied, to a\r\ncertain extent, the Venango oil region. But this theory is scarcely\r\nplausible. Fort Venango was completed by the French at Franklin, seven\r\nmiles below the mouth of Oil Creek, in the spring of 1754, and this was\r\nprobably about the beginning of their active operations in this region.\r\nBut the construction of these pits no doubt antedates the French\r\noperations very many years. Timber placed in these oil pits, and\r\nthoroughly impregnated by its preserving properties, would be almost\r\nproof against the ravages of time. As evidence of this, petroleum in\r\nsome of its forms entered largely into the ingredients used in embalming\r\nby the ancient Egyptians. These embalmed bodies remain perfect to this\r\nday. Even the cerements remain with every thread distinct and perfect as\r\nwhen they came from the loom, in days when Joseph was prime minister in\r\nEgypt.\r\n\r\nThere is evidence, too, from the growth of timber in the very beds of\r\nthese excavations, that they claim an antiquity greater far than the\r\noccupation of their valleys by the French. Year after year, a silent,\r\nsolemn record was made by the concentric circles, first in the shrub,\r\nnext in the sapling, and then in the fully developed tree, that tells of\r\nthe lapse of time since these mysterious works were in operation.\r\n\r\nBesides all this, where was the market for the immense quantity of\r\npetroleum that must have been produced from these excavations, on the\r\nsupposition that they were constructed by the French? Surely not at\r\nhome, for neither in the misty traditions nor early records of that time\r\ndo we find reference to any large quantity of this product, nor even\r\ntheir facilities for conveying it to the seaboard, had there been a\r\ndemand for it at home.\r\n\r\nThe sole object of the French at that time was to gain military\r\npossession of the country. This is seen in the line of forts that was\r\nthrown across the country, extending from Erie, Pennsylvania, to a point\r\non the Ohio River below Pittsburg. There is no evidence that they made\r\nany attempt either to cultivate the soil or develop the mineral\r\nresources of the country. There were white inhabitants, too, who were\r\nsettled here quite as early as the temporary occupancy of the French.\r\nTheir descendants remain unto this day. These early settlers knew\r\nnothing of French operations in petroleum. They were ignorant of its\r\nproduction, save in minute quantities, as it issued spontaneously from\r\nthe earth; nor could they throw any light on the origin of the\r\nexcavations that were found in their midst.\r\n\r\nAnother theory, that has been somewhat popular is, that these pits are\r\ndue to the labors of the American Indians. But the very term labor seems\r\nabsurd when used in reference to these lords of the forest. They never\r\nemployed themselves in manual labor of any kind. The female portion of\r\nthe community planted a little corn, and constructed rude lodges to\r\nshelter them from the wintry blast; but they never even dreamed of trade\r\nor commerce. The Indian loved to roam through the wilderness and follow\r\nthe war path--to seek for game to supply present wants, or to bring home\r\nthe scalp of his enemy as a trophy of his prowess, but would scorn to\r\nbend his strength to rude toil in excavating multitudinous pits for the\r\nreception of oil, or in bearing it from place to place after it had been\r\nsecured.\r\n\r\nBeyond all doubt the Indians were well acquainted with the existence and\r\nmany of the properties of petroleum. That they valued it is beyond\r\nquestion. They used it, both for medicinal and toilette purposes. But\r\nthey knew of its existence and production, just as did the early white\r\nsettlers: they found it bubbling up from the bed of the stream and from\r\nlow marshy places along its banks. They, no doubt, collected it in small\r\nquantities, without labor and without much forethought, and with this\r\nsmall supply were content. But even if a much larger supply had been\r\ndesirable, and if the modern idea of traffic had found a place in their\r\nhearts, they had no facilities for conveying it from place to place.\r\nEven at the present time, with all our improvement in the arts, the\r\ngreat desideratum is an appropriate vessel for carrying petroleum from\r\nplace to place, or retaining it safely in any locality; but the Indians\r\nwere utterly destitute of any appliances suitable for the purpose. If\r\nthey were acquainted with a rude kind of pottery, it was without\r\nglazing, and so incapable of retaining fluids, particularly petroleum;\r\nand we have no knowledge of their ability to construct vessels of any\r\nother material that would answer the desired purpose. The inference is\r\ntherefore fair, that for purposes of trade the production of oil was not\r\ndesirable in so large quantities as indicated by these excavations. The\r\nsame reasons would hold good in relation to its use in the religious\r\nceremonies of the Indians. It could be used only in limited quantities,\r\nfrom the want of convenient receptacles for its retention. Besides, we\r\ndoubt whether the Indians were sufficiently devout to resort to such\r\nlabor and pains in religious worship.\r\n\r\nReference is sometimes made to a letter said to have been written by the\r\ncommander of Fort Duquesne (Pittsburg) to General Montcalm, describing a\r\ngrand scene of fire worship on the banks of Oil Creek, where the whole\r\nsurface of the creek, being coated with oil, was set on fire, producing\r\nin the night season a wonderful conflagration. But there is room for the\r\nsuspicion that this account is apocryphal. Such scenes as are there\r\ndescribed have been witnessed on Oil Creek since the beginning of the\r\nmodern oil trade. During the continuance of several accidental\r\nconflagrations, the scene has been awfully grand and impressive. It has\r\nbeen strongly suggestive of the conflagration of the last day, when\r\n\r\n  'The lightnings, barbed, red with wrath,\r\n  Sent from the quiver of Omnipotence,\r\n  Cross and recross the fiery gloom, and burn\r\n  Into the centre!--burn without, within,\r\n  And help the native fires which God awoke,\r\n  And kindled with the fury of His wrath.'\r\n\r\nBut this was when thousands of barrels of petroleum had been stored up\r\nin vats, and when the combustible fluid was spouting from the wells at\r\nthe rate of many hundred barrels per day. Before the present deep wells\r\nwere bored, oil was not produced in sufficient quantities to cause such\r\na conflagration, and there was never seen upon the creek a stratum of\r\nthe fluid of such consistency as to be inflammable.\r\n\r\nThe remains of the once powerful confederacy of Indians known as the Six\r\nNations still linger in Western Pennsylvania, in a region not very\r\nremote from Oil Creek, but they can throw no light upon the origin of\r\nthese pits. In regard to their history, they can give no more\r\ninformation than they can concerning the mounds and fortifications,\r\nruined castles, and dismantled cities, that tell us of a once glorious\r\npast, of a mysterious decadence, and of the utter vanity of all earthly\r\nglory.\r\n\r\nThere are men still living in the oil valley, who were on terms of\r\nfamiliar intimacy with Cornplanter, a celebrated chief of the Seneca\r\ntribe of Indians--the last of a noble and heroic line of chieftains that\r\nhad borne sway from the Canadas to the Ohio River, and who was living at\r\nthe time of the French occupation. But in reciting his own deeds and\r\nmemories, and those of his fathers, who had gone to the silent hunting\r\ngrounds of the spirit land, he could say nothing of early oil\r\noperations, any further than the collection of it in small quantities\r\nfor medical or ornamental purposes.\r\n\r\nThe only rational conclusion, therefore, at which we can arrive in\r\nregard to these early oil operations is, that they are due, not to the\r\nIndians or French or early white settlers, but to some primitive\r\ndwellers on the soil, who have long since passed away, leaving no\r\nwritten records to tell of their origin or history, but stamping the\r\nimpress of their existence on our mountains and in our valleys, assuring\r\nus of their power and the magnificence of their operations, yet leaving\r\nus to wonder that such strength could fail, that such magnificence could\r\nperish, and that such darkness could settle over the memory of a great\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nAs before intimated, petroleum was found in Venango County by the\r\nearliest white settlers, and was esteemed for its medical properties.\r\nBut it was obtained only in minute quantities. It was found in\r\nparticular localities along the banks of the Alleghany, issuing with the\r\nwater from springs, and sometimes bubbling up from the bottom of the\r\nriver in small globules, that rising to the surface, disperse themselves\r\nupon the water, and glide away in silent beauty.\r\n\r\nThe principal oil spring, or that from which the largest quantity of\r\npetroleum was collected, was located on Oil Creek, about two miles from\r\nits mouth. From this the main supply was drawn for the wants of the\r\nearlier inhabitants. And as the demand was limited, no great amount of\r\nenterprise was called forth in its production. The _modus operandi_ was\r\nmost primitive, and yet withal the results were satisfactory.\r\n\r\nA point was selected where the oil appeared to bubble up most freely, a\r\nslight excavation was made, and the oil suffered to collect. When a\r\ntolerable stratum of petroleum had collected on the top of the water, a\r\ncoarse blanket was thrown upon the surface, that soon became saturated\r\nwith the oil, but rejected the water. The blanket was then taken out,\r\nwrung into a tub or barrel, and the operation repeated.\r\n\r\nBut the demand was limited. Most families kept a supply for their own\r\nuse. Yet, for ordinary purposes, a pint bottle was sufficient for a\r\nyear's consumption. Indeed, half a dozen barrels were all that could be\r\ndisposed of throughout the entire oil region of Western Pennsylvania up\r\nto a period when the researches of science were brought to bear upon its\r\npurification as an illuminator. Almost every good housewife was supposed\r\nto have a small store of Seneca oil, as it was popularly termed, laid by\r\nin case of accident, for the medication of cuts and bruises; and not\r\neven the most popular of the nostrums of the present day is so much\r\nrelied on as was this--nature's own medicine--by the early settlers in\r\nthese valleys.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time a well was bored on the bank of the Alleghany, within\r\ntwo miles of the mouth of Oil Creek, in quest of salt water, with a view\r\nto the manufacture of salt. This was some forty years ago. After sinking\r\nthe well through the solid rock to the depth of seventy or eighty feet,\r\noil presented itself in such quantities, mingled with the salt water, as\r\nto fill the miners with the utmost disgust, and induce them to abandon\r\nthe well altogether. They were boring for salt, not for petroleum. Salt\r\nwas an article of utility and large demand; oil was of comparatively\r\nsmall importance, and already a drug in the market, through the\r\nspontaneous yield of nature. Again, a well was dug in the town of\r\nFranklin, about thirty years ago, for the supply of a household with\r\nwater. At the depth of thirty feet there were evident signs of\r\npetroleum, that were annoying to the workmen; and although the water of\r\nthe well was used for culinary purposes, it always bore a trace of oil,\r\nand was absolutely offensive to those unaccustomed to it. A hole has\r\nsince been sunk in this well through the rock, but the yield of oil has\r\nnot been as great as in some other wells in the immediate neighborhood.\r\nIn the cases cited above were strong hints of the existence of the\r\ntreasure concealed in the rocks beneath, and even of the manner of\r\nobtaining it. It was in fact the treasure knocking at the door, and\r\nasking to be released, in order to contribute to human wealth and\r\nenjoyment.\r\n\r\nBut the time had not then arrived for the grant of this great boon. The\r\nearth was at the first made the repository of all the gifts that man\r\nshould need until the end of time. But they were not all revealed at the\r\nfirst, nor to succeeding generations, until the fitting time arrived,\r\nand man's necessities induced the great Giver to unlock the treasure\r\nhouse and dispense his rich bounty.\r\n\r\nBefore man was created, the great treasure house in the earth's bosom\r\nwas filled with its minerals, and as the centuries rolled by in their\r\nslow and solemn march, such treasures were gradually brought to light.\r\nNot at once did the earth disclose her mighty resources, but just as man\r\nneeded them, and as they should tend to his own best interests. Even on\r\nthe banks of the river that watered the terrestrial paradise, gold was\r\nfound, but although 'the gold of that land was good,' it was brought to\r\nlight in limited quantities. In the same sacred locality, and at the\r\nsame early day in the history of time, 'the bdellium and the onyx stone'\r\nwere found in their beauty; yet were they few and rare, until God would\r\nconsecrate the treasures of the earth to His own service in the\r\nconstruction and adornment of the tabernacle and the temple. The great\r\ntreasure house of earth was then opened, until gold became common as\r\nbrass, and precious stones numerous almost as the pebbles of the brook,\r\nand the riches of the earth were eternally consecrated to the service of\r\nGod.\r\n\r\nAnd in the present century, and within our own recollection, when the\r\nworld's business seemed to be stagnated--when the sails of commerce\r\nflapped idly at the masts--when the great highways of trade and traffic\r\nwere in danger of being deserted, and the coffers of the nation were\r\nalmost exhausted, the hand of Providence unlocked the treasures of\r\nCalifornia and Australia, and every department of business has become\r\nprosperous, and every branch of industry has received a new impetus. A\r\nnew lesson has been taught the world: that God's treasures are\r\ninexhaustible, and that his hand can never be shortened.\r\n\r\nAnd now here, in this remote county of Western Pennsylvania, God's\r\ntreasure has been concealed for ages--locked up in the very heart of the\r\neternal rock, awaiting the time of need, and accomplishment of the\r\neternal purposes of Omnipotence. It has oozed forth in limited\r\nquantities during the lapse of centuries, as though to show us now that\r\nman cannot lay his hand upon the houses of God's treasure until his own\r\nappointed time.\r\n\r\nWe know not where the great Chemist has his laboratory, or where he\r\nformed the mighty retorts that are distilling for us the oily treasure:\r\nmost probably they were fashioned when the earth assumed its present\r\nform; and since 'the morning stars' sang creation's hymn together, deep\r\ndown amid earth's rocky caverns, through the revolving centuries, the\r\nstores have been accumulating that are destined to bless the world and\r\nbecome elements of national wealth. And now from that great laboratory,\r\nthrough innumerable channels, cut through the living rock by the hand of\r\nthe Creator, and by 'paths which no fowl knoweth, and which the\r\nvulture's eye hath not seen,' is that treasure brought near to the\r\nearth's surface, just in our time of need. When other supplies are\r\nfailing and other resources giving way, we see God's wisdom in opening\r\nup new channels. The great Benefactor would teach us that his resources\r\nare unlimited, and that our time of need is but the beginning of his\r\noverflowing bounty.\r\n\r\nIt is really strange how slow men were to discover the abundance of this\r\nsupply, and to trace it to its luxuriant deposits amid the rocks. While\r\nit was literally forcing itself upon their observation, it was only by a\r\nroundabout process that they discovered its richness and importance. As\r\nearly as the year 1835 its presence amid the rocks was made known on the\r\nAlleghany River, a short distance above Pittsburg, by its interference\r\nwith the salt wells; but no dream of its future importance seems to have\r\nforced itself upon either the miner or the capitalist until within the\r\nlast few years.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the first real conception of the petroleum trade was in the mind\r\nof a young physician in the Venango region. Yet it was but a dream, and,\r\nlike many another dream of the past, it was in advance of the age, and\r\nresulted in nothing but speculation. In looking at the numerous slight\r\nveins of oil that oozed up along the bed of Oil Creek, the thought\r\noccurred to him that, by tracing these little veins to their source, the\r\nmain artery might be reached. And as this tracing must be through the\r\nrock, the proper plan would be to bore down through it, until a large\r\nvein was reached. This was certainly professional, and, now that it has\r\nbeen tested, seems a very plain and simple idea. But it was like the\r\ntheory of Columbus in regard to a new continent, entirely too bold for\r\nthe times, and was rejected. There was in this physician's theory but\r\none link lacking in order to have anticipated the entire scheme of oil\r\nproduction as it was afterward generally carried on. The thought did not\r\noccur to him of leasing the lands along Oil Creek, and thus securing an\r\ninterest in the entire territory: he thought only of purchasing, and as\r\nhe could not command the capital for this purpose, the scheme was lost,\r\nas far as he was concerned. The idea was however a brilliant one, and\r\nentitled its originator to be classed among the long line of those who\r\nhave dreamed without realizing the vision, and who have sown precious\r\nseed without being permitted to reap the harvest.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, artificial oil had begun to be produced in large\r\nquantities from different minerals, principally, however, from cannel\r\ncoal, by the process of destructive distillation. This oil was refined\r\nand deodorized, and found to be a valuable illuminator. A spirit of\r\ninquiry and investigation was excited. It was ascertained that this\r\nartificial oil, the product of distillation, was almost identical in its\r\nproperties with the natural oil of the valleys--that the latter might be\r\npurified and deodorized, and if found in sufficient quantities, prove a\r\nsource of wealth to the country. The enterprise of bygone ages in the\r\nexcavation of oil pits was considered by many, but the process seemed\r\ntedious, and, in addition, the finest portions of the oil were in danger\r\nof passing off by evaporation.\r\n\r\nThe grand idea, however, was struggling toward the light. If the oil,\r\nnow so greatly desired, bubbled up through concealed clefts in the\r\nrocks, why might it not be discovered in large quantities by boring in\r\nsupposed localities deep into the rock that was conjectured to be its\r\nhome? And if found in some localities while boring for salt water, why\r\nnot expect to find it more certainly in localities where there were\r\ndiscovered such decided 'surface appearances'?\r\n\r\nThe work was finally commenced by Colonel E. L. Drake, near the upper\r\noil springs on Oil Creek, by boring in the rock. But it was labor\r\npursued under difficulties. To have announced the intention of boring\r\nfor petroleum into the bowels of the earth, would have been to provoke\r\nmirth and ridicule. The enterprise would have appeared quite as\r\nvisionary as that of Noah to the antediluvians in building his ark\r\nagainst an anticipated inundation. It was generally supposed that the\r\nsearch was for salt water; and perhaps the idea was a complex one even\r\nin the mind of the proprietor. Oil was desirable, salt was within the\r\nreach of probability; if the former failed, the latter might probably be\r\nsecured; and if neither object was attained, the search for salt would\r\nbe considered neither visionary nor disreputable.\r\n\r\nBut the work went forward, through good report and through evil report,\r\nparticularly the latter, until August 26th, 1859, when, at the depth of\r\nseventy feet, the drill suddenly sank into a cavity in the rock, when\r\nthere was immediate evidence of the presence of oil in large quantities.\r\nIt was like the cry of 'Land ho!' amid the weary, disheartened mariners\r\nthat accompanied Columbus to the Western World. The goal had been\r\nreached at last. A pathway had been opened up through the rocks,\r\nleading, not to universal empire, but to realms of wealth hitherto\r\nunknown. Providence had literally forced upon men's attention that which\r\nshould fill many dwellings with light, and many hearts with gladness.\r\n\r\nUpon withdrawing the drill from the well, the oil and water rose nearly\r\nto the surface. The question was now to be tested whether the petroleum\r\nwould present itself in sufficient quantities to justify further\r\nproceedings, or whether it was, like many another dream, to vanish in\r\ndarkness, or dissolve in tears. The well was tubed, and by a common hand\r\npump yielded ten barrels per day. By means of a more powerful pump,\r\nworked by a small engine, this quantity was increased to forty barrels\r\nper day. The supply was uninterrupted, the engine working day and night,\r\nand the question was considered settled. This oil well immediately\r\nbecame the centre of attraction. It was visited by hundreds and\r\nthousands, all eager to see for themselves, and test by actual\r\nexperiment, the wondrous stories that had been related concerning its\r\nenormous yield, by counting the seconds that elapsed during the yield of\r\na single gallon.\r\n\r\nThe fortune of the valley of Oil Creek was now settled, and the prices\r\nof land throughout its whole extent immediately became fabulous.\r\nSometimes entire farms were sold, but generally they were leased in very\r\nsmall lots. In some cases the operator was required to give one half and\r\neven five eighths of the product, besides a handsome bonus, to the\r\nproprietor of the soil. The work now commenced in earnest. A tide of\r\nspeculators began to set in toward the oil region, that would have\r\noverpowered that of California or Australia in their palmiest days.\r\n\r\nThe excitement did not stop at the valley of Oil Creek. It extended down\r\nthe Alleghany to Franklin, and up the valley of French Creek, which\r\nenters the Alleghany seven miles below the mouth of Oil Creek. Wells\r\nwere sunk at all these points, and many of them yielded from three to\r\nforty barrels per day. In the course of the summer succeeding the first\r\nsuccessful experiment on Oil Creek, there were not less than two hundred\r\nwells in different stages of progress in the town of Franklin alone.\r\nWells were being bored in gardens, in dooryards, and even in some cases\r\nin the bottoms of wells from which water had been procured for household\r\npurposes. So numerous were the tall 'derricks,' that a profane riverman\r\nmade the remark that the people of Franklin must be remarkably pious, as\r\nalmost every man seemed to be building a meeting house with a tall\r\nsteeple near his dwelling. At one time there were in Franklin fifteen\r\nproductive wells, yielding a daily aggregate of one hundred and forty\r\nbarrels. Among these were what was known as 'the celebrated Evans well.'\r\nThis was, in some respects, the most remarkable well in all the region.\r\nIt was sunk by its proprietor in the bottom of the well that had long\r\nbeen used for household purposes. An humble house and lot constituted\r\nhis entire worldly possessions. The work in the well was performed\r\nentirely by his own family. Being a blacksmith, he constructed his own\r\nboring implements, and was dependent on no outside assistance. Patiently\r\nand assiduously did the blacksmith and his two sons toil on, as they had\r\nseldom toiled before, the former guiding the drill, and the latter\r\napplying the power by hand to the simple machinery. At the depth of only\r\nforty feet in the rock they struck a crevice that promised to pour them\r\nout rivers of oil. In attempting to enlarge this, the drill broke, the\r\nfragment remaining in the cavity, and defying every effort used for its\r\nremoval. The well was then tubed, and a hand pump inserted, when it was\r\nfound to yield at the rate of ten or fifteen barrels per day.\r\nSpeculation soon began to run wild, and the fortunate owner of this\r\nwell, among other propositions, received an offer of fifty thousand\r\ndollars for his well. To all these tempting offers he persistently\r\nreturned the same reply--that he had bored that well for his own use,\r\nand that if others wished a well, they could do as he had done.\r\n\r\nOil was generally obtained in the valley around Franklin at the depth of\r\nabout three hundred feet from the surface, for pumping wells; in the\r\nvalley of Oil Creek the same stratum was reached at about half that\r\ndepth. In all these wells, whether successful as oil wells or not, a\r\nstrong body of salt water was obtained, that added greatly to the\r\nfacility of separating the oil by its increased gravity. Hitherto the\r\nbusiness had been pursued with advantage and profit to those who were\r\nengaged. The demand was steady and prices remunerative, and visions of\r\nuntold wealth were looming up before the minds of thousands. Prospecting\r\nwas extending far and near. Every stream and ravine that deflected\r\ntoward the Alleghany or Oil Creek was leased, and in very many\r\nunpropitious localities operations were commenced.\r\n\r\nBut a change now took place in the development of oil proceedings that\r\nwrought ruin in the hopes of many an ardent operator. In the Oil Creek\r\nregion, some of the smaller wells having been exhausted, resort was had\r\nto deeper boring. One hopeful theorist imagined that if the desirable\r\nfluid came from a very great depth, it might be good policy to seek it\r\nin a stratum still nearer its rocky home. So down he penetrated,\r\nregardless of the 'fine show' of oil that presented itself by the way,\r\nuntil at the depth of five hundred feet in the rock, a vein of mingled\r\ngas and oil was reached that literally forced the boring implements from\r\nthe well. This sudden exodus of the implements was followed by a steady\r\nstream of petroleum that rose to the height of sixty or seventy feet\r\nabove the surface, and was occasionally accompanied by a roaring noise\r\nlike the Geysers of Iceland.\r\n\r\nHere was a new feature in oil operations. The idea of flowing wells for\r\nthe production of petroleum, once inaugurated, was seized upon with\r\navidity. There was not only a spontaneous yield, but a yield in enormous\r\nquantities. And so a pumping well was voted a slow institution, and all\r\nparties on Oil Creek renewed the operation of boring, and, at about the\r\ndepth of the first flowing well, obtained almost uniformly like success.\r\n\r\nThese flowing wells were almost as difficult to govern and regulate as\r\nwas Pegasus of old. They 'played fantastic tricks' when least expected,\r\nthrowing the oil over the workmen, and in one case, when the vein of\r\npetroleum was suddenly opened, setting fire to the machinery, and\r\ndestroying the lives of those in the vicinity. The enormous yield of\r\nthese wells had the effect of bringing down the price of petroleum to so\r\nlow a figure that pumping wells were at once closed. They could not be\r\nworked with profit. Hence almost the entire oil business has, for the\r\npresent at least, been confined to the valley of Oil Creek. The yield\r\nfrom the flowing wells varies from fifty to two thousand barrels per\r\nday. This, as may readily be supposed, involves the loss by wastage of\r\nimmense quantities of oil, that is scattered on the ground and runs into\r\nthe creek. So great is this waste at times, that the oil is gathered in\r\nquantities on the surface of the Alleghany for a distance of eight or\r\nten miles below the mouth of Oil Creek, in the eddies, and along the\r\nstill water of the shore, and is distinctly perceptible at Pittsburg, a\r\ndistance of one hundred and forty miles from the wells.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these wells are confined to a very narrow valley, and in\r\nmany instances in very close proximity, it is very rare that they\r\ninterfere with each other. In fact cases are known where two wells have\r\nbeen bored within forty feet of each other, with the discovery of oil at\r\ndifferent depths, and even of different qualities, as regards color and\r\ngravity. In some instances the well has all the characteristics of an\r\nintermittent spring. One in particular may be specified for the\r\nregularity of its operations. It would remain quiescent for about\r\nfifteen minutes, when there would be heard the sound as of fearful\r\nagitation far down in its depths. This rumbling and strife would then\r\nappear to approach the surface for a few moments, when the petroleum\r\nwould rush forth from the orifice, mingled with gas and foam, almost\r\nwith the fury of a round shot from a rifled cannon. This furious flow\r\nwould continue for fifteen or twenty minutes, when it would suddenly\r\nsubside, and all would be peace again. This alternate rest and motion\r\nwould continue with great regularity day and night, yielding perhaps one\r\nhundred and fifty barrels per day. In other instances, there are\r\ninterruptions of days and even weeks, when the flow will be continued as\r\nbefore. In others still, the yield is steady and uninterrupted, yielding\r\nwith unvarying regularity from week to week.\r\n\r\nThe oil region of Venango County, as far as has been explored, is\r\nconfined to the creek and river bottoms. In connection with wells that\r\nhave been opened, there is a superincumbent stratum of earth, varying\r\nfrom ten to sixty feet in thickness: underlying this is a stratum of\r\nargillaceous shale, generally about one hundred and eighty feet in\r\nthickness, and then a stratum of white sandstone. Sometimes this\r\nsandstone is intermingled with red, presenting a ruddy appearance as the\r\nsand is withdrawn from the well in the process of boring.\r\n\r\nOccasionally in passing through the shale, small fissures in the rock\r\nare passed through, with circumstances indicating the presence of a\r\nstratum or vein of water, as at such times the sand accumulated in\r\nboring all disappears, leaving the bits clean and bright. At other times\r\nsmall veins or cavities of petroleum are pierced, the product of which\r\nrises to the surface of the well, and indicates its presence by\r\nappearing in the sand pump. In the earlier stages of the business this\r\n'show of oil,' as it was termed, was considered most favorable to\r\nultimate success; but latterly it is not regarded as essential, as many\r\nfirst-class wells have been discovered without the intermediate show;\r\nand on the other hand, there has been many a brilliant show that has\r\nresulted in failure and disappointment.\r\n\r\nThe presence of surface oil is not always a sure criterion in deciding\r\nupon a location for a well. Oftentimes very fine wells are opened in\r\nlocalities where no oil has been found on the surface, and no appearance\r\nof oil having been obtained at any previous time in the neighborhood.\r\nPerhaps the most unsuccessful operations in the whole Oil Creek valley\r\nhave been in the midst of the ancient pits that have already been\r\nalluded to. Wells have been bored in the bottom of these pits without\r\nthe least success. At a point near the bank of the Alleghany, some two\r\nmiles above Franklin, there was a well-known oil spring some forty years\r\nago. It supplied the family that lived near it as well as the\r\nsurrounding neighborhood with petroleum for medical and other domestic\r\npurposes to the extent of their wants. For many years the supply has\r\nentirely failed. During a recent excavation, at the precise spot where\r\nit was known formerly to exist, for the purpose of laying the abutment\r\nof a bridge, no trace of oil was found--not even a discoloration of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nOf course the boring of wells has become quite an institution in the oil\r\nregion, and is carried on with great system. After selecting a site, the\r\nfirst thing in order is the erection of a derrick. This is a frame in\r\nthe form of a truncated pyramid, about ten feet square at the bottom,\r\nand five at the top, having one of its four posts pierced with rounds to\r\nanswer the purpose of a ladder, by means of which the workmen can ascend\r\nand descend. This derrick is from twenty to thirty feet in height, and\r\nhas at its summit a pulley, by means of which the boring implements are\r\ndrawn from the well. A pit is then sunk through the earth within the\r\nderrick, about six feet square, until the work is interrupted by water.\r\nThe remaining distance to the rock is reached by driving strong\r\ncast-iron pipe by means of a battering ram. This pipe has a caliber of\r\nabout five inches, with walls of one inch in thickness. It is prepared\r\nin joints of about eight feet in length, which are connected together at\r\nthe point of contact by wrought-iron bands. When the pipe reaches the\r\nrock, the earth is removed from its cavity, and the operation of boring\r\nis ready to be commenced. Occasionally, however, this driving operation\r\nis interrupted by coming upon a huge bowlder. When this is the case, the\r\nboring operation is commenced, and a hole made through the bowlder\r\nnearly equal in size to the cavity of the pipe, when the driving is\r\nresumed, and the pipe made to ream its way through the stone. Sometimes\r\nin these operations the pipe is fractured, or turned aside from a\r\nperpendicular direction, when the place is abandoned and a new location\r\nsought for.\r\n\r\nThe boring implements do not differ materially from those used in\r\nsinking artesian wells. As a general thing, bits of two or three sizes\r\nare used, the first and smallest of which only has a cutting edge. If\r\nthe hole to be sunk through the rock is to be four inches in diameter,\r\nthe bits would be, first, one with a cutting edge two inches in width;\r\nsecondly, a blunt bit, three inches wide by one inch in thickness; and\r\nlastly, by a similar bit four inches wide. These bits have a shank about\r\ntwo feet in length, that is screwed into an auger stem ten or twelve\r\nfeet in length and about one inch and a half in diameter. Connected with\r\nthis auger stem is an arrangement called, technically, 'jars'--two\r\nelongated loops of iron, working in each other like links in a chain,\r\nthat serve to jar the bit loose when it sticks fast in the process of\r\nboring.\r\n\r\nSometimes this auger stem is connected with wooden rods, joined together\r\nwith screws and sockets, new joints being added as the work proceeds;\r\nbut more generally the connection is with a rope or cable of about one\r\nand a half inches in diameter. To this rope the auger stem is attached\r\nby a clamp and screw, that can be readily shifted as the progress of the\r\nwork renders it necessary. The entire weight of these implements is from\r\nfour to six hundred pounds. The power applied is sometimes that of two\r\nor three men working by means of a spring pole; but oftener a steam\r\nengine of from four to eight horse power. Midway between the well and\r\nthe engine a post is planted, on which is balanced a working beam about\r\nsixteen feet in length: one end of this beam is attached to the crank of\r\nthe engine, and the other to the implements in the well. The power is\r\napplied to raising the bit--the blow is produced by the fall of the same\r\nwhen relieved by the downward motion of the working beam.\r\n\r\nIn the process of boring, the workman is seated over the well, and, by a\r\ntransverse handle attached to the machinery just above the rope, turns\r\nthe rope, and with it the bit, partially around, so that each stroke of\r\nthe bit on the rock beneath is slightly across the cut that has preceded\r\nit. After the fore bit has proceeded about two feet, or until the work\r\nbegins to clog with sand, it is withdrawn, and the next is inserted in\r\nits place, and the work is then finished as it goes by the last bit. The\r\nfragments of rock that are cut away descend to the bottom of the well in\r\nthe form of sand, and are readily withdrawn by means of the sand pump.\r\nThis is a simple copper tube about six feet in length, with a diameter\r\nsomething less than that of the well, and furnished at the lower end\r\nwith a simple valve opening upward. This pump is let down into the well\r\nby a rope, and, when it reaches the bottom, is agitated for a few\r\nmoments, when the sand is forced up through the valve, and thus\r\nwithdrawn from the well, when the boring is again resumed.\r\n\r\nAs the work proceeds, a register is kept by the judicious borer of the\r\ndifferent strata passed through, and also of the veins of water and oil\r\npassed through, in order to the formation of an intelligent judgment in\r\ntubing the well.\r\n\r\nAs might be supposed, this operation of descending amid the rocks is not\r\nwithout its difficulties and discouragements. Sometimes the bit breaks\r\nor becomes detached from the auger stem, leaving a fragment of hardened\r\nsteel, or an entire bit, deep in the recesses of the rock. When the\r\nlatter is the case, recourse is had to divers expedients, by means of\r\nimplements armed with sockets and spring jaws, in order to entrap the\r\ntruant bit. And it is marvellous what success generally attends these\r\nefforts to extract bits that are oftentimes two or three hundred feet\r\nbelow the surface. Sometimes, however, these efforts fail, and the well\r\nmust be abandoned, with all the labor and anxiety that have been\r\nexpended upon it.\r\n\r\nDuring the progress of the boring there is more or less carburetted\r\nhydrogen gas set free. This supply is so abundant at times as to cause\r\nan ebullition in the water of the well, resembling the boiling of a pot.\r\nIn the case of the flowing wells, when the vein of petroleum is reached,\r\nthe gas rushes forth with such violence, and the upward pressure is so\r\nfurious, as to force the implements from the well, and even the tubing,\r\nwhen not properly secured, has been driven through the derrick in its\r\nupward progress.\r\n\r\nAfter the boring has been successfully accomplished, the next operation\r\nconsists in tubing the well. This is merely the introduction of a copper\r\nor iron chamber, extending down, or nearly so, to the vein of the oil.\r\nThis tubing is, for the pumping and larger-class flowing wells, usually\r\nabout two and a half or three inches in diameter, consisting of sections\r\nabout twenty feet in length, and connected together by means of screw\r\nand socket joints. As there are usually many veins of water passed\r\nthrough in boring, some device must be resorted to in order to shut off\r\nthis water from the oil vein and produce a vacuum. This is accomplished\r\nby applying what is called a 'seed bag' to the tube at the point where\r\nthis stoppage is desirable. The seed bag is a tube of strong leather\r\nsome eighteen inches in length and about five inches in diameter. It is\r\nput around the metallic tube and the lower end firmly tied around it.\r\nFrom a pint to a quart of flaxseed is then poured in, and the upper end\r\nbound rather more slightly than the lower, when the tube is sunk to its\r\nplace in the well. In a few hours the flaxseed in the sack below will\r\nhave swollen and distended the bag so as to effectually shut off all\r\nwater from above. When it is desirable to withdraw the tubing from the\r\nwell, the effort of raising it will break the slight fastening at the\r\nupper end of the leathern sack, permitting the seed to escape and the\r\ntube to be withdrawn without difficulty. When the well is to be pumped,\r\na pump barrel is placed at the lower end of the tube, with piston rods\r\nextending to the top and attached to the working beam used in boring the\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nAs the petroleum is ordinarily mixed with more or less water when\r\nbrought to the surface, it is thrown first into a tank, and the superior\r\ngravity of the water causing it to sink to the bottom, it is drawn off\r\nfrom beneath, and the petroleum placed in barrels. These tanks are of\r\nall sizes, ranking from thirty to two thousand barrels each.\r\n\r\nFor the present, wells that were formerly pumped at a profit are biding\r\ntheir time; for at present prices of oil operations upon them would be\r\nruinous. This renders the computation of the weekly yield of the Oil\r\nCreek region comparatively easy. There are at the present time not far\r\nfrom one hundred flowing wells along the valley of the creek, producing\r\nprobably on an average about forty thousand barrels per week. A portion\r\nof this is refined in the county, but by far the largest part is shipped\r\nto a distance, either by the Alleghany River by way of Pittsburg, or by\r\nthe Philadelphia and Erie or Atlantic and Great Western Railroads to the\r\nEastern markets.\r\n\r\nThe necessities of the trade have given rise to many ingenious\r\ninventions in getting the oil to market. The wells extend along Oil\r\nCreek for a distance of about fourteen miles from its mouth. The ground\r\nis not favorable for land carriage, as the valley is narrow and the\r\nstream tortuous. The creek itself is too small for navigation under\r\nordinary circumstances, and a railroad with steam power would be in the\r\nhighest degree dangerous. To compensate for all these difficulties, a\r\nsystem of artificial navigation has been adopted. Throughout the whole\r\ndistance, at intervals of perhaps a mile, dams have been constructed\r\nacross the creek, with draws in the centre, that can be easily opened\r\nat the proper time. In this way 'pond freshets' are arranged one or two\r\ndays in a week. By the appointed time, all persons having oil to run out\r\nof the creek have their boats ready, and as the water from the upper dam\r\nraises the creek below, the fleet of boats sets out. Each successive dam\r\nraises the water to a higher level, and as the fleet proceeds, small at\r\nfirst, it increases until, as it approaches the river, it often numbers\r\ntwo hundred boats, bearing with them not less than ten thousand barrels\r\nof petroleum.\r\n\r\nThe advent of this fleet of boats to the mouth of the creek is in the\r\nhighest degree exciting. As boat after boat rushes into the river, there\r\nis the dashing to and fro of the boatmen, and the shouts of the\r\nmultitude on the shore. Here and there a collision occurs that often\r\nresults in the crushing of the feebler boat, and the indiscriminate\r\nmingling of boatmen, fragments of the broken craft, oil, and fixtures in\r\none common ruin. In this fleet the form and variety of boats beggars all\r\ndescription. Sometimes there is the orthodox flatboat, filled with\r\niron-bound barrels, with an air of respectability hovering around it.\r\nNext will follow a rude scow, and close upon it an unwieldy 'bulk,' into\r\nwhich the oil has been pumped at the well. After this, perhaps, may be\r\nseen a rude nondescript, that surely was never dreamed of outside the\r\noil region. It consists of a series of rough ladders, constructed of\r\ntall saplings. Between each pair of rounds in these ladders is placed a\r\nbarrel of oil, floating in the water, but kept in position by its\r\nhamper. A number of these ladders are lashed together, until the float\r\ncontains two or three hundred barrels of oil.\r\n\r\nThe bulks spoken of are about sixteen feet square and two or three feet\r\nin depth, divided internally into bulk-heads of perhaps four feet\r\nsquare, to prevent any undue agitation of the oil by the motion of the\r\nboat, and are sometimes decked over. These unpromising boats, as well as\r\nthe ladder floats, are, during favorable weather, often run to Pittsburg\r\nwith entire safety. Steamboats, however, run up to the mouth of Oil\r\nCreek during the time of high water, and afford the safest and most\r\nexpeditious means of transportation.\r\n\r\nAs to the abundance of the supply in this region, there can be but\r\nlittle doubt. Wells seem at times to become exhausted, but it is from\r\nlocal causes. At times a cavity may be tapped that has been supplied\r\nfrom a very small avenue, and may be readily exhausted, but exhausted\r\nonly to be refilled again. The fact that wells do not interfere with\r\neach other, even when but fifty feet apart, is evidence that the supply\r\nis not confined to a limited stratum, but is drawn from the great deeps\r\nbeneath. The existence of the ancient oil pits, before alluded to,\r\nassures us that the supply has been continued for centuries; and\r\nobservation confirms this, as we have noticed the hitherto unused\r\ntreasure bubbling up silently through the crevices in the rocks and\r\ngradually evaporating amid the sands, or arising in the beds of the\r\nstreams and floating down upon their surface. The history of the\r\npetroleum trade in other lands encourages us as to the abundance of the\r\nsupply in our own. In the northern part of Italy, petroleum has been\r\ncollected for more than two hundred years, without any intimation that\r\nthe supply is being exhausted. In Burmah a supply has been drawn from\r\nthe earth for an unknown period, and so far are these wells from\r\nexhaustion that they yield at the present time over twenty-five millions\r\nof gallons per annum. We may well suppose, then, that the treasure\r\nbrought to light in such abundance in our day will not be readily\r\nexhausted--that as the coals are found in illimitable abundance for fuel\r\nas the forests fail, petroleum for illuminating purposes will be found\r\nin like profusion.\r\n\r\nWe have said that the petroleum trade has known no infancy, but has\r\nsprung at once into maturity. The oil wells of Venango County alone\r\nproduced, during the first year of their operation, more oil than the\r\nentire product of the whale fisheries during the most favorable and\r\nprosperous year in their history. At the present time, after a lapse of\r\nlittle more than two years, the daily product of the wells on Oil Creek\r\nalone is computed to be over six thousand barrels. And in this\r\nneighborhood the quantity might be wellnigh doubled, were it not for the\r\nlow price the product commands.\r\n\r\nPetroleum differs in its characteristics in different localities. It is\r\nusually heavier in the shallow wells than in those that are deeper.\r\nOrdinarily it is of a greenish hue, that changes to a reddish as the oil\r\nbecomes lighter and more evaporative. It is all characterized by a\r\nstrong and pungent odor peculiar to itself. The gravity of the various\r\nkinds of oil is ascertained by the oleometer. The lighter oils are found\r\non Oil Creek, and are about 40° to 46° Baumé; at Franklin, from 30° to\r\n32°.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to speak of the uses of petroleum at the present time,\r\nfor these uses have not yet been fully developed. In its refined state\r\nit is preëminent as an illuminator. In this character it yields the palm\r\nto gas in matters of convenience and neatness, but is superior to it on\r\nthe score of general adaptation and economy. Besides, the quality of the\r\nlight is superior to that of gas, being soft, mild, tranquil, and\r\nexceedingly white. In the rural districts, where coal gas is\r\nimpracticable, it would be an intolerable calamity to be obliged to\r\nreturn to the use of the old tallow candle that was the main dependence\r\nin years gone by. As an article of fuel, it has been used to some extent\r\nin the oil regions, but the appliances have been so rude that its use\r\nhas not been general. When proper machinery shall have been invented, no\r\ndoubt it will be a most important item of fuel in ocean navigation as\r\nwell as in railway travel, conducing alike to economy of space and to\r\nease of manipulation.\r\n\r\nIn the manufacture of gas it has already been brought into successful\r\nuse, both in this country and in England, and has been found most\r\nvaluable alike in the quality of the product and in the economy of its\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\nAs a medicinal agent it has long been employed in this country. It was\r\nused by the Indians in this way when the country was first discovered.\r\nIt was also held in high estimation by the early settlers in what are\r\nnow called the oil regions, for the medication of cuts and bruises, as\r\nwell as an internal curative. It formed the staple of the British and\r\nAmerican oils that were sold largely and at high rates throughout the\r\ncountry. It is a remarkable fact that since the quantity has increased\r\nso largely the popular faith has been correspondingly weakened in its\r\nmedical efficacy.\r\n\r\nFurther uses are developed in the process of refining. This latter is\r\nexceedingly simple. The crude oil is placed in an iron retort connected\r\nwith a coil of pipe in a vessel of cold water. Heat is then applied to\r\nthe retort, when the process of distillation commences. The first\r\nproduct is a light-colored, volatile substance, sometimes called\r\nnaphtha, that is very explosive. This substance is used in the place of\r\nspirits of turpentine in the preparation of paints and varnishes, and,\r\nafter further treatment, in removing paints and grease from clothing.\r\nThe next product from the retort is the refined fluid for illumination.\r\nThis is of a yellow color, with a bluish tinge and powerful odor,\r\nrequiring further treatment before it is ready for the lamp. This\r\ntreatment consists in placing it in a cistern lined with lead, and\r\nagitating it with a portion of sulphuric acid. The acid and impurities\r\nhaving subsided, the oil is drawn off, and further agitated with soda\r\nlye, and finally with water, when it is ready for use. After this a\r\ncoarse oil for the lubrication of machinery is produced. Paraffine is\r\nanother product resulting from this distillation. It is a white,\r\ntasteless, and inodorous substance, used in the manufacture of candles.\r\nThe residuum in the retort may be applied to various useful purposes. It\r\nis sometimes used as fuel, and sometimes takes the place of coal tar in\r\nthe arts, and by chemical processes is made to yield products useful in\r\nthe laboratory and in the manufactory.\r\n\r\nBut the æsthetics connected with this distillation must not be passed by\r\nin silence. On a bright, sunshiny day we see a bright globule of\r\npetroleum rising from the bottom of the stream. As it reaches the\r\nsurface of the water it disperses, and, as it glides away, all the\r\ncolors of the rainbow are reflected from its undulating surface.\r\n\r\n  'What radiant changes strike th' astonished sight!\r\n   What glowing hues of mingled shade and light!\r\n   Not equal beauties gild the lucid west\r\n   With parting beams o'er all profusely drest,\r\n   Not lovelier colors paint the vernal dawn,\r\n   When Orient dews impearl th' enamelled lawn,\r\n   Than in its waves in bright suffusion flow,\r\n   That now with gold empyreal seem to glow;\r\n   Now in pellucid sapphires meet the view,\r\n   And emulate the soft celestial hue;\r\n   Now beams a flaming crimson on the eye,\r\n   And now assume the purple's deeper dye.\r\n   But here description clouds each shining ray--\r\n   What terms of art can Nature's powers display?'\r\n\r\nWe gaze upon those colors, ever changing in their lustre and variety,\r\nuntil imagination revels in its most delightful dreams, suggesting\r\nthoughts of the good and beautiful, and reminding how beauty lingers\r\namid the most unpromising things of earth! And just as the bow that\r\nspans the mantling cloud reminds us of all beautiful things that glow\r\naround its antitype that spans the emerald throne on high, so, as we\r\ngaze upon the prismatic tints that are reflected from the oily surface,\r\nwe dream of all that is beautiful in color and gorgeous in tinted\r\nradiance, as being hidden amid the elements of petroleum.\r\n\r\nThis dream has its fulfilment amid the processes of distillation and\r\ntreatment. One product in these processes is called aniline, that is,\r\nthe base of those beautiful colors so popular with ladies these last\r\ndays--Mauve, Magenta, and Solferino. And in process of time, no doubt,\r\nthe most delicate colors for flower and landscape painting will be\r\neduced, that will give a new impetus to the fine arts, and to the\r\ndevelopment of taste in our midst.\r\n\r\nAnd now where shall we look for the origin of this treasure? From what\r\nelements is it elaborated? We cannot go with the great Chemist to his\r\nlaboratory and look upon the ingredients, and notice the treatment used\r\nthere. Science, although denominated the 'star eyed,' cannot penetrate\r\nthe mighty strata of everlasting rocks that lie beneath us, and reveal\r\nto us these mysteries of nature. 'There is a path which no fowl knoweth,\r\nand which the vulture's eye hath not seen: the lion's whelps have not\r\ntrodden it, nor the fierce lion passed by it. He putteth forth His hand\r\nupon the rock; he overturneth the mountains by the roots. He cutteth out\r\nrivers among the rocks; and His eye seeth every precious thing. He\r\nbindeth the floods from overflowing; and the thing that is hid, bringeth\r\nHe forth to light.'\r\n\r\nNature has her mysteries. The earth has its great secrets. But over all,\r\na God of wisdom and goodness presides. Age after age has rolled\r\nby--change after change has agitated the history of Time, as forms of\r\nbeauty have been moulded and marred--as songs of joy have been sung, and\r\nrequiems of sadness chanted in the great highways and quiet bypaths of\r\nlife--the living of bygone ages are slumbering quietly in the dust, and\r\nthe living of the present are hurrying to the same 'pale realms of\r\nshade.' The nations of antiquity have passed off the stage with all\r\ntheir grandeur and littleness, and the nations of more modern times are\r\nsurging and dashing to and fro, like ships in the wild chaos of ocean's\r\nstorms. God alone is great!\r\n\r\nChanges, too, have been quietly going on beneath us in the earth's\r\nbosom. A great dream of science, but perhaps an earnest, glowing\r\nreality, suggests that when God's almighty power was rolling away the\r\ncurtains of darkness from earth's chaotic state--forming channels for\r\noceans and rivers, and heaving up as barriers the mountain chains of\r\nearth, His eternal prescience of man's coming need induced Him to bury\r\ndeep down in subterranean recesses the imperfect vegetable organisms of\r\na pre-Adamic state, that in the ages to come, coals and oils and gases\r\nmight be drawn forth to supply his wants.\r\n\r\nWe find in the coal deposits traces of ferns and leaves of gigantic\r\nstature and proportions. Casts of huge boles of trees are found among\r\nour fossils, inducing the belief that in some bygone age quantities of\r\nvegetable matter, absolutely enormous, were produced on the earth's\r\nsurface. And it is presumable that in some of the revolutions that have\r\nagitated our planet, renovating, improving, and fitting it for a higher\r\norder of life, mighty deposits of this vegetable matter were buried up\r\namid the rocky strata, to be evolved in new forms and products. And it\r\nmay be that since the days of Adam this vegetable deposit has been\r\nundergoing the process of destructive distillation in the hidden regions\r\nbeneath. In this process heat would not be wanting: it is furnished by\r\nthe natural constitution of the earth.\r\n\r\nSays Professor Hitchcock:\r\n\r\n     'Wherever in Europe or America the temperature of the air, water,\r\n     rocks, in deep excavations, has been ascertained, it has been found\r\n     higher than the mean temperature of the climate at the surface, and\r\n     experiments have been made at hundreds of places; it is found that\r\n     the heat of the earth increases rapidly as we descend below that\r\n     point in the earth's crust to which the sun's heat extends. The\r\n     mean rate of increase of heat has been stated by the British\r\n     Association to be one degree of Fahrenheit's thermometer for every\r\n     forty-five feet: at this rate all the known rocks in the earth\r\n     would be melted at a depth of sixty miles.'\r\n\r\nHere, then, are all the conditions necessary to the production of\r\npetroleum. The vegetable deposit was made amid the rocks--we know not\r\nwhen; internal heat has been decomposing that matter, and setting free\r\nits gases; these again have been condensed as they approached the\r\nsurface, and have filled up the cavities, and accumulated amid the\r\nrocks, until in these last days the earth has literally poured us out\r\nrivers of oil.\r\n\r\nStill all this is mere speculation. The hidden path yet remains\r\nunexplored. It may always remain so; but we have the great fact of\r\nDivine providence in the rich and copious supply, that is none the less\r\nvaluable because it flows from an unknown source, and comes to us\r\nthrough unexplored channels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ANGELS OF WAR.\r\n\r\n  Two angels sat on a war-cloud, watching the din of the fight,\r\n  One was an angel of darkness, and one was an angel of light.\r\n  The first looked down and smiled, with fearful, fiendish glee:\r\n  'Of all earth's sights,' he shouted, 'this is the one for me!\r\n  Where is your God in heaven? and where on earth is your Christ?\r\n  What have your laws and your gospels, your churches and sabbaths sufficed--\r\n  That here in this freest land, and now in this ripest age,\r\n  Men give up reason and manhood for brutal fury and rage?\r\n  Men who have prattled of peace, of brotherhood, freedom, and right!\r\n  Here is a thirst which is deeper! See how your Christians can fight!\r\n  Louder than savages' war-whoop, fiercer than savages' ire,\r\n  List to the din of their cannon, look on its murderous fire.\r\n  These be thy triumphs, O Freedom! Christendom, this is thy good!\r\n  Deadliest weapons of warfare, earth's reddest vintage of blood;\r\n  The fate of states and nations, the fate of freedom and right\r\n  Staked on the nerve of a man, poised on a cannon ball's flight;\r\n  A land of widows and orphans, a land of mourning and pain,\r\n  Whose air is heavy with sighs, whose soil is red with the slain.\r\n  Say, Earth, art thou drawing nearer that age, the promised of yore,\r\n  When swords shall be beaten to ploughshares, and war be learned no more?\r\n  Is the Prince of Peace appearing of whom your prophets tell?\r\n  Lo, here is the Prince of Darkness, and here is the reign of Hell.'\r\n\r\n  And the angel laughed in scorn, and said, in his fearful glee:\r\n  'Aha, of all earth's sights, this is the one for me.'\r\n\r\n  The other angel spake, and his face was fair and bright,\r\n  'And of all earth's sights to me this is the noblest sight.\r\n  At the touch of a hand profane laid on its sacred things,\r\n  Countless as heaven's bright army, to arms a nation springs.\r\n  Thousands of peaceful homes give up their cherished ones,\r\n  Young wives give up their bridegrooms, old mothers give their sons;\r\n  Manhood gives up its work, and eager youth its dream:\r\n  The reign of sense is over, the spirit rules supreme.\r\n  No victims of brute rage, no hirelings trained to fight,\r\n  But men in calmest manhood, fresh from the hearthstone's light.\r\n  This right arm, maimed and crippled, was dedicate to art;\r\n  All high and noble purpose beat with that pulseless heart;\r\n  Pure bridal kisses linger upon this gory brow;\r\n  On those fair curls a mother's blessing rested even now:\r\n  Such men,--the best and dearest, the very life of life,\r\n  Earth has no ransom for them,--have hastened to the strife.\r\n  'The nobler days have come when men must do and die,'\r\n  Methinks I hear them say, with calm, uplifted eye:\r\n  'Our human lives are nothing; thy will, great God, is all;\r\n  We come to work thy work, we have heard the heavenly call;\r\n\r\n  Thy right hand holdeth chance, thy strong arm ruleth fate,\r\n  To thee, the God of battles, our lives are consecrate.\r\n  Not at the foeman's call, not to the foeman's sword,\r\n  But we come at the disposal and the summons of the Lord.'\r\n\r\n  'This,' said the second angel, and his smile was fair to see,\r\n  'Of all the sights on earth is the noblest one to me;\r\n  No brutelike men are these, nay, rather to my eyes,\r\n  Men raised to angels' heights of calm self-sacrifice.'\r\n  Yet he wept, and weeping prayed, 'Oh, may these sons of men\r\n  Keep faith and strength and patience, till thou comest, Christ, again!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA TRAGEDY OF ERROR.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n\r\nA low English phaeton was drawn up before the door of the post office of\r\na French seaport town. In it was seated a lady, with her veil down and\r\nher parasol held closely over her face. My story begins with a gentleman\r\ncoming out of the office and handing her a letter.\r\n\r\nHe stood beside the carriage a moment before getting in. She gave him\r\nher parasol to hold, and then lifted her veil, showing a very pretty\r\nface. This couple seemed to be full of interest for the passers by, most\r\nof whom stared hard and exchanged significant glances. Such persons as\r\nwere looking on at the moment saw the lady turn very pale as her eyes\r\nfell on the direction of the letter. Her companion saw it too, and\r\ninstantly stepping into the place beside her, took up the reins, and\r\ndrove rapidly along the main street of the town, past the harbor, to an\r\nopen road skirting the sea. Here he slackened pace. The lady was leaning\r\nback, with her veil down again, and the letter lying open in her lap.\r\nHer attitude was almost that of unconsciousness, and he could see that\r\nher eyes were closed. Having satisfied himself of this, he hastily\r\npossessed himself of the letter, and read as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTHAMPTON, _July 16th, 18--._\r\n\r\nMY DEAR HORTENSE: You will see by my postmark that I am a\r\nthousand leagues nearer home than when I last wrote, but I have hardly\r\ntime to explain the change. M. P---- has given me a most unlooked-for\r\n_congé_. After so many months of separation, we shall be able to spend a\r\nfew weeks together. God be praised! We got in here from New York this\r\nmorning, and I have had the good luck to find a vessel, the _Armorique_,\r\nwhich sails straight for H----. The mail leaves directly, but we shall\r\nprobably be detained a few hours by the tide; so this will reach you a\r\nday before I arrive: the master calculates we shall get in early\r\nThursday morning. Ah, Hortense! how the time drags! Three whole days. If\r\nI did not write from New York, it is because I was unwilling to torment\r\nyou with an expectancy which, as it is, I venture to hope, you will find\r\nlong enough. Farewell. To a warmer greeting! Your devoted C.B.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the gentleman replaced the paper on his companion's lap, his face\r\nwas almost as pale as hers. For a moment he gazed fixedly and vacantly\r\nbefore him, and a half-suppressed curse escaped his lips. Then his eyes\r\nreverted to his neighbor. After some hesitation, during which he allowed\r\nthe reins to hang so loose that the horse lapsed into a walk, he touched\r\nher gently on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n'Well, Hortense,' said he, in a very pleasant tone, 'what's the matter;\r\nhave you fallen asleep?'\r\n\r\nHortense slowly opened her eyes, and, seeing that they had left the town\r\nbehind them, raised her veil. Her features were stiffened with horror.\r\n\r\n'Read that,' said she, holding out the open letter.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman took it, and pretended to read it again.\r\n\r\n'Ah! M. Bernier returns. Delightful!' he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n'How, delightful?' asked Hortense; 'we mustn't jest at so serious a\r\ncrisis, my friend.'\r\n\r\n'True,' said the other, 'it will be a solemn meeting. Two years of\r\nabsence is a great deal.'\r\n\r\n'O Heaven! I shall never dare to face him,' cried Hortense, bursting\r\ninto tears.\r\n\r\nCovering her face with one hand, she put out the other toward that of\r\nher friend. But he was plunged in so deep a reverie, that he did not\r\nperceive the movement. Suddenly he came to, aroused by her sobs.\r\n\r\n'Come, come,' said he, in the tone of one who wishes to coax another\r\ninto mistrust of a danger before which he does not himself feel so\r\nsecure but that the sight of a companion's indifference will give him\r\nrelief. 'What if he does come? He need learn nothing. He will stay but a\r\nshort time, and sail away again as unsuspecting as he came.'\r\n\r\n'Learn nothing! You surprise me. Every tongue that greets him, if only\r\nto say _bon jour_, will wag to the tune of a certain person's\r\nmisconduct.'\r\n\r\n'Bah! People don't think about us quite as much as you fancy. You and I,\r\n_n'est-ce-pas_? we have little time to concern ourselves about our\r\nneighbors' failings. Very well, other people are in the same box, better\r\nor worse. When a ship goes to pieces on those rocks out at sea, the poor\r\ndevils who are pushing their way to land on a floating spar, don't\r\nbestow many glances on those who are battling with the waves beside\r\nthem. Their eyes are fastened to the shore, and all their care is for\r\ntheir own safety. In life we are all afloat on a tumultuous sea; we are\r\nall struggling toward some _terra firma_ of wealth or love or leisure.\r\nThe roaring of the waves we kick up about us and the spray we dash into\r\nour eyes deafen and blind us to the sayings and doings of our fellows.\r\nProvided we climb high and dry, what do we care for them?'\r\n\r\n'Ay, but if we don't? When we've lost hope ourselves, we want to make\r\nothers sink. We hang weights about their necks, and dive down into the\r\ndirtiest pools for stones to cast at them. My friend, you don't feel the\r\nshots which are not aimed at you. It isn't of you the town talks, but of\r\nme: a poor woman throws herself off the pier yonder, and drowns before a\r\nkind hand has time to restrain her, and her corpse floats over the water\r\nfor all the world to look at. When her husband comes up to see what the\r\ncrowd means, is there any lack of kind friends to give him the good news\r\nof his wife's death?'\r\n\r\n'As long as a woman is light enough to float, Hortense, she is not\r\ncounted drowned. It's only when she sinks out of sight that they give\r\nher up.'\r\n\r\nHortense was silent a moment, looking at the sea with swollen eyes.\r\n\r\n'Louis,' she said at last, 'we were speaking metaphorically: I have half\r\na mind to drown myself literally.'\r\n\r\n'Nonsense!' replied Louis; 'an accused pleads 'not guilty,' and hangs\r\nhimself in prison. What do the papers say? People talk, do they? Can't\r\nyou talk as well as they? A woman is in the wrong from the moment she\r\nholds her tongue and refuses battle. And that you do too often. That\r\npocket handkerchief is always more or less of a flag of truce.'\r\n\r\n'I'm sure I don't know,' said Hortense indifferently; 'perhaps it is.'\r\n\r\nThere are moments of grief in which certain aspects of the subject of\r\nour distress seems as irrelevant as matters entirely foreign to it. Her\r\neyes were still fastened on the sea. There was another silence. 'O my\r\npoor Charles!' she murmured, at length, 'to what a hearth do you\r\nreturn!'\r\n\r\n'Hortense,' said the gentleman, as if he had not heard her, although, to\r\na third person, it would have appeared that it was because he had done\r\nso that he spoke: 'I do not need to tell you that it will never happen\r\nto me to betray our secret. But I will answer for it that so long as M.\r\nBernier is at home no mortal shall breathe a syllable of it.'\r\n\r\n'What of that?' sighed Hortense. 'He will not be with me ten minutes\r\nwithout guessing it.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, as for that,' said her companion, dryly, 'that's your own affair.'\r\n\r\n'Monsieur de Meyrau!' cried the lady.\r\n\r\n'It seems to me,' continued the other, 'that in making such a guarantee,\r\nI have done my part of the business.'\r\n\r\n'Your part of the business!' sobbed Hortense.\r\n\r\nM. de Meyrau made no reply, but with a great cut of the whip sent the\r\nhorse bounding along the road. Nothing more was said. Hortense lay back\r\nin the carriage with her face buried in her handkerchief, moaning. Her\r\ncompanion sat upright, with contracted brows and firmly set teeth,\r\nlooking straight before him, and by an occasional heavy lash keeping the\r\nhorse at a furious pace. A wayfarer might have taken him for a ravisher\r\nescaping with a victim worn out with resistance. Travellers to whom they\r\nwere known would perhaps have seen a deep meaning in this accidental\r\nanalogy. So, by a _détour_, they returned to the town.\r\n\r\nWhen Hortense reached home, she went straight up to a little boudoir on\r\nthe second floor, and shut herself in. This room was at the back of the\r\nhouse, and her maid, who was at that moment walking in the long garden\r\nwhich stretched down to the water, where there was a landing place for\r\nsmall boats, saw her draw in the window blind and darken the room, still\r\nin her bonnet and cloak. She remained alone for a couple of hours. At\r\nfive o'clock, some time after the hour at which she was usually summoned\r\nto dress her mistress for the evening, the maid knocked at Hortense's\r\ndoor, and offered her services. Madame called out, from within, that she\r\nhad a _migraine_, and would not be dressed.\r\n\r\n'Can I get anything for madame?' asked Josephine; 'a _tisane_, a warm\r\ndrink, something?'\r\n\r\n'Nothing, nothing.'\r\n\r\n'Will madame dine?'\r\n\r\n'No.'\r\n\r\n'Madame had better not go wholly without eating.'\r\n\r\n'Bring me a bottle of wine--of brandy.'\r\n\r\nJosephine obeyed. When she returned, Hortense was standing in the\r\ndoorway, and as one of the shutters had meanwhile been thrown open, the\r\nwoman could see that, although her mistress's hat had been tossed upon\r\nthe sofa, her cloak had not been removed, and that her face was very\r\npale. Josephine felt that she might not offer sympathy nor ask\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\n'Will madame have nothing more?' she ventured to say, as she handed her\r\nthe tray.\r\n\r\nMadame shook her head, and closed and locked the door.\r\n\r\nJosephine stood a moment vexed, irresolute, listening. She heard no\r\nsound. At last she deliberately stooped down and applied her eye to the\r\nkey-hole.\r\n\r\nThis is what she saw:\r\n\r\nHer mistress had gone to the open window, and stood with her back to the\r\ndoor, looking out at the sea. She held the bottle by the neck in one\r\nhand, which hung listlessly by her side; the other was resting on a\r\nglass half filled with water, standing, together with an open letter, on\r\na table beside her. She kept this position until Josephine began to\r\ngrow tired of waiting. But just as she was about to arise in despair of\r\ngratifying her curiosity, madame raised the bottle and glass, and filled\r\nthe latter full. Josephine looked more eagerly. Hortense held it a\r\nmoment against the light, and then drained it down.\r\n\r\nJosephine could not restrain an involuntary whistle. But her surprise\r\nbecame amazement when she saw her mistress prepare to take a second\r\nglass. Hortense put it down, however, before its contents were half\r\ngone, as if struck by a sudden thought, and hurried across the room. She\r\nstooped down before a cabinet, and took out a small opera glass. With\r\nthis she returned to the window, put it to her eyes, and again spent\r\nsome moments in looking seaward. The purpose of this proceeding\r\nJosephine could not make out. The only result visible to her was that\r\nher mistress suddenly dropped the lorgnette on the table, and sank down\r\non an armchair, covering her face with her hands.\r\n\r\nJosephine could contain her wonderment no longer. She hurried down to\r\nthe kitchen.\r\n\r\n'Valentine,' said she to the cook, 'what on earth can be the matter with\r\nMadame? She will have no dinner, she is drinking brandy by the glassful,\r\na moment ago she was looking out to sea with a lorgnette, and now she is\r\ncrying dreadfully with an open letter in her lap.'\r\n\r\nThe cook looked up from her potato-peeling with a significant wink.\r\n\r\n'What can it be,' said she, 'but that monsieur returns?'\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nAt six o'clock, Josephine and Valentine were still sitting together,\r\ndiscussing the probable causes and consequences of the event hinted at\r\nby the latter. Suddenly Madame Bernier's bell rang. Josephine was only\r\ntoo glad to answer it. She met her mistress descending the stairs,\r\ncombed, cloaked, and veiled, with no traces of agitation, but a very\r\npale face.\r\n\r\n'I am going out,' said Madame Bernier; 'if M. le Vicomte comes, tell him\r\nI am at my mother-in-law's, and wish him to wait till I return.'\r\n\r\nJosephine opened the door, and let her mistress pass; then stood\r\nwatching her as she crossed the court.\r\n\r\n'Her mother-in-law's,' muttered the maid; 'she has the face!'\r\n\r\nWhen Hortense reached the street, she took her way, not through the\r\ntown, to the ancient quarter where that ancient lady, her husband's\r\nmother, lived, but in a very different direction. She followed the\r\ncourse of the quay, beside the harbor, till she entered a crowded\r\nregion, chiefly the residence of fishermen and boatmen. Here she raised\r\nher veil. Dusk was beginning to fall. She walked as if desirous to\r\nattract as little observation as possible, and yet to examine narrowly\r\nthe population in the midst of which she found herself. Her dress was so\r\nplain that there was nothing in her appearance to solicit attention;\r\nyet, if for any reason a passer by had happened to notice her, he could\r\nnot have helped being struck by the contained intensity with which she\r\nscrutinized every figure she met. Her manner was that of a person\r\nseeking to recognize a long-lost friend, or perhaps, rather, a long-lost\r\nenemy, in a crowd. At last she stopped before a flight of steps, at the\r\nfoot of which was a landing place for half a dozen little boats,\r\nemployed to carry passengers between the two sides of the port, at times\r\nwhen the drawbridge above was closed for the passage of vessels. While\r\nshe stood she was witness of the following scene:\r\n\r\nA man, in a red woollen fisherman's cap, was sitting on the top of the\r\nsteps, smoking the short stump of a pipe, with his face to the water.\r\nHappening to turn about, his eye fell on a little child, hurrying along\r\nthe quay toward a dingy tenement close at hand, with a jug in its arms.\r\n\r\n'Hullo, youngster!' cried the man; 'what have you got there? Come here.'\r\n\r\nThe little child looked back, but, instead of obeying, only quickened\r\nits walk.\r\n\r\n'The devil take you, come here!' repeated the man, angrily, 'or I'll\r\nwring your beggarly neck. You won't obey your own uncle, eh?'\r\n\r\nThe child stopped, and ruefully made its way to its relative, looking\r\naround several times toward the house, as if to appeal to some counter\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\n'Come, make haste!' pursued the man, 'or I shall go and fetch you.\r\nMove!'\r\n\r\nThe child advanced to within half a dozen paces of the steps, and then\r\nstood still, eyeing the man cautiously, and hugging the jug tight.\r\n\r\n'Come on, you little beggar, come up close.'\r\n\r\nThe youngster kept a stolid silence, however, and did not budge.\r\nSuddenly its self-styled uncle leaned forward, swept out his arm,\r\nclutched hold of its little sunburnt wrist, and dragged it toward him.\r\n\r\n'Why didn't you come when you were called?' he asked, running his\r\ndisengaged hand into the infant's frowsy mop of hair, and shaking its\r\nhead until it staggered. 'Why didn't you come, you unmannerly little\r\nbrute, eh?--eh?--eh?' accompanying every interrogation with a renewed\r\nshake.\r\n\r\nThe child made no answer. It simply and vainly endeavored to twist its\r\nneck around under the man's grip, and transmit some call for succor to\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\n'Come, keep your head straight. Look at me, and answer me. What's in\r\nthat jug? Don't lie.'\r\n\r\n'Milk.'\r\n\r\n'Who for?'\r\n\r\n'Granny.'\r\n\r\n'Granny be hanged.'\r\n\r\nThe man disengaged his hands, lifted the jug from the child's feeble\r\ngrasp, tilted it toward the light, surveyed its contents, put it to his\r\nlips, and exhausted them. The child, although liberated, did not\r\nretreat. It stood watching its uncle drink until he lowered the jug.\r\nThen, as he met its eyes, it said:\r\n\r\n'It was for the baby.'\r\n\r\nFor a moment the man was irresolute. But the child seemed to have a\r\nforesight of the parental resentment, for it had hardly spoken when it\r\ndarted backward and scampered off, just in time to elude a blow from the\r\njug, which the man sent clattering at its heels. When it was out of\r\nsight, he faced about to the water again, and replaced the pipe between\r\nhis teeth with a heavy scowl and a murmur that sounded to Madame Bernier\r\nvery like--'I wish the baby'd choke.'\r\n\r\nHortense was a mute spectator of this little drama. When it was over,\r\nshe turned around, and retraced her steps twenty yards with her hand to\r\nher head. Then she walked straight back, and addressed the man.\r\n\r\n'My good man,' she said, in a very pleasant voice, 'are you the master\r\nof one of these boats?'\r\n\r\nHe looked up at her. In a moment the pipe was out of his mouth, and a\r\nbroad grin in its place. He rose, with his hand to his cap.\r\n\r\n'I am, madame, at your service.'\r\n\r\n'Will you take me to the other side?'\r\n\r\n'You don't need a boat; the bridge is closed,' said one of his comrades\r\nat the foot of the steps, looking that way.\r\n\r\n'I know it,' said Madame Bernier; 'but I wish to go to the cemetery, and\r\na boat will save me half a mile walking.'\r\n\r\n'The cemetery is shut at this hour.'\r\n\r\n'_Allons_, leave madame alone,' said the man first spoken to. 'This way,\r\nmy lady.'\r\n\r\nHortense seated herself in the stern of the boat. The man took the\r\nsculls.\r\n\r\n'Straight across? ' he asked.\r\n\r\nHortense looked around her. 'It's a fine evening,' said she; 'suppose\r\nyou row me out to the lighthouse, and leave me at the point nearest the\r\ncemetery on our way back.'\r\n\r\n'Very well,' rejoined the boatman; 'fifteen sous,' and began to pull\r\nlustily.\r\n\r\n'_Allez_, I'll pay you well,' said Madame.\r\n\r\n'Fifteen sous is the fare,' insisted the man.\r\n\r\n'Give me a pleasant row, and I'll give you a hundred,' said Hortense.\r\n\r\nHer companion said nothing. He evidently wished to appear not to have\r\nheard her remark. Silence was probably the most dignified manner of\r\nreceiving a promise too munificent to be anything but a jest.\r\n\r\nFor some time this silence was maintained, broken only by the trickling\r\nof the oars and the sounds from the neighboring shores and vessels.\r\nMadame Bernier was plunged in a sidelong scrutiny of her ferryman's\r\ncountenance. He was a man of about thirty-five. His face was dogged,\r\nbrutal, and sullen. These indications were perhaps exaggerated by the\r\ndull monotony of his exercise. The eyes lacked a certain rascally gleam\r\nwhich had appeared in them when he was so _empressé_ with the offer of\r\nhis services. The face was better then--that is, if vice is better than\r\nignorance. We say a countenance is 'lit up' by a smile; and indeed that\r\nmomentary flicker does the office of a candle in a dark room. It sheds a\r\nray upon the dim upholstery of our souls. The visages of poor men,\r\ngenerally, know few alternations. There is a large class of human beings\r\nwhom fortune restricts to a single change of expression, or, perhaps,\r\nrather to a single expression. Ah me! the faces which wear either\r\nnakedness or rags; whose repose is stagnation, whose activity vice;\r\ningorant at their worst, infamous at their best!\r\n\r\n'Don't pull too hard,' said Hortense at last. 'Hadn't you better take\r\nbreath a moment?'\r\n\r\n'Madame is very good,' said the man, leaning upon his oars. 'But if you\r\nhad taken me by the hour,' he added, with a return of the vicious grin,\r\n'you wouldn't catch me loitering.'\r\n\r\n'I suppose you work very hard,' said Madame Bernier.\r\n\r\nThe man gave a little toss of his head, as if to intimate the inadequacy\r\nof any supposition to grasp the extent of his labors.\r\n\r\n'I've been up since four o'clock this morning, wheeling bales and boxes\r\non the quay, and plying my little boat. Sweating without five minutes'\r\nintermission. _C'est comme ça_. Sometimes I tell my mate I think I'll\r\ntake a plunge in the basin to dry myself. Ha! ha! ha!'\r\n\r\n'And of course you gain little,' said Madame Bernier.\r\n\r\n'Worse than nothing. Just what will keep me fat enough for starvation to\r\nfeed on.'\r\n\r\n'How? you go without your necessary food?'\r\n\r\n'Necessary is a very elastic word, madame. You can narrow it down, so\r\nthat in the degree above nothing it means luxury. My necessary food is\r\nsometimes thin air. If I don't deprive myself of that, it's because I\r\ncan't.'\r\n\r\n'Is it possible to be so unfortunate?'\r\n\r\n'Shall I tell you what I have eaten to-day?'\r\n\r\n'Do,' said Madame Bernier.\r\n\r\n'A piece of black bread and a salt herring are all that have passed my\r\nlips for twelve hours.'\r\n\r\n'Why don't you get some better work?'\r\n\r\n'If I should die to-night,' pursued the boatman, heedless of the\r\nquestion, in the manner of a man whose impetus on the track of self-pity\r\ndrives him past the signal flags of relief, 'what would there be left to\r\nbury me? These clothes I have on might buy me a long box. For the cost\r\nof this shabby old suit, that hasn't lasted me a twelve-month, I could\r\nget one that I wouldn't wear out in a thousand years. _La bonne idée!_'\r\n\r\n'Why don't you get some work that pays better?' repeated Hortense.\r\n\r\nThe man dipped his oars again.\r\n\r\n'Work that pays better? I must work for work. I must earn that too. Work\r\nis wages. I count the promise of the next week's employment the best\r\npart of my Saturday night's pocketings. Fifty casks rolled from the ship\r\nto the storehouse mean two things: thirty sous and fifty more to roll\r\nthe next day. Just so a crushed hand, or a dislocated shoulder, mean\r\ntwenty francs to the apothecary and _bon jour_ to my business.'\r\n\r\n'Are you married?' asked Hortense.\r\n\r\n'No, I thank you. I'm not cursed with that blessing. But I've an old\r\nmother, a sister, and three nephews, who look to me for support. The old\r\nwoman's too old to work; the lass is too lazy, and the little ones are\r\ntoo young. But they're none of them too old or young to be hungry,\r\n_allez_. I'll be hanged if I'm not a father to them all.'\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. The man had resumed rowing. Madame Bernier sat\r\nmotionless, still examining her neighbor's physiognomy. The sinking sun,\r\nstriking full upon his face, covered it with an almost lurid glare. Her\r\nown features being darkened against the western sky, the direction of\r\nthem was quite indistinguishable to her companion.\r\n\r\n'Why don't you leave the place?' she said at last.\r\n\r\n'Leave it! how?' he replied, looking up with the rough avidity with\r\nwhich people of his class receive proposals touching their interests,\r\nextending to the most philanthropic suggestions that mistrustful\r\neagerness with which experience has taught them to defend their own side\r\nof a bargain--the only form of proposal that she has made them\r\nacquainted with.\r\n\r\n'Go somewhere else,' said Hortense.\r\n\r\n'Where, for instance!'\r\n\r\n'To some new country--America.'\r\n\r\nThe man burst into a loud laugh. Madame Bernier's face bore more\r\nevidence of interest in the play of his features than of that\r\ndiscomfiture which generally accompanies the consciousness of ridicule.\r\n\r\n'There's a lady's scheme for you! If you'll write for furnished\r\napartments, _là-bas_, I don't desire anything better. But no leaps in\r\nthe dark for me. America and Algeria are very fine words to cram into an\r\nempty stomach when you're lounging in the sun, out of work, just as you\r\nstuff tobacco into your pipe and let the smoke curl around your head.\r\nBut they fade away before a cutlet and a bottle of wine. When the earth\r\ngrows so smooth and the air so pure that you can see the American coast\r\nfrom the pier yonder, then I'll make up my bundle. Not before.'\r\n\r\n'You're afraid, then, to risk anything?'\r\n\r\n'I'm afraid of nothing, _moi_. But I am not a fool either. I don't want\r\nto kick away my _sabots_ till I am certain of a pair of shoes. I can go\r\nbarefoot here. I don't want to find water where I counted on land. As\r\nfor America, I've been there already.'\r\n\r\n'Ah! you've been there?'\r\n\r\n'I've been to Brazil and Mexico and California and the West Indies.'\r\n\r\n'Ah!'\r\n\r\n'I've been to Asia, too.'\r\n\r\n'Ah!'\r\n\r\n'_Pardio_, to China and India. Oh, I've seen the world! I've been three\r\ntimes around the Cape.'\r\n\r\n'You've been a seaman then?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, ma'am; fourteen years.'\r\n\r\n'On what ship?'\r\n\r\n'Bless your heart, on fifty ships.'\r\n\r\n'French?'\r\n\r\n'French and English and Spanish; mostly Spanish.'\r\n\r\n'Ah?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, and the more fool I was.'\r\n\r\n'How so?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, it was a dog's life. I'd drown any dog that would play half the\r\nmean tricks I used to see.'\r\n\r\n'And you never had a hand in any yourself?'\r\n\r\n'_Pardon_, I gave what I got. I was as good a Spaniard and as great a\r\ndevil as any. I carried my knife with the best of them, and drew it as\r\nquickly, and plunged it as deep. I've got scars, if you weren't a lady.\r\nBut I'd warrant to find you their mates on a dozen Spanish hides!'\r\n\r\nHe seemed to pull with renewed vigor at the recollection. There was a\r\nshort silence.\r\n\r\n'Do you suppose,' said Madame Bernier, in a few moments--'do you\r\nremember--that is, can you form any idea whether you ever killed a man?'\r\n\r\nThere was a momentary slackening of the boatman's oars. He gave a sharp\r\nglance at his passenger's countenance, which was still so shaded by her\r\nposition, however, as to be indistinguishable. The tone of her\r\ninterrogation had betrayed a simple, idle curiosity. He hesitated a\r\nmoment, and then gave one of those conscious, cautious, dubious smiles,\r\nwhich may cover either a criminal assumption of more than the truth or a\r\nguilty repudiation of it.\r\n\r\n'_Mon Dieu!_' said he, with a great shrug, 'there's a question!... I\r\nnever killed one without a reason.'\r\n\r\n'Of course not,' said Hortense.\r\n\r\n'Though a reason in South America, _ma foi!_' added the boatman,\r\n'wouldn't be a reason here.'\r\n\r\n'I suppose not. What would be a reason there?'\r\n\r\n'Well, if I killed a man in Valparaiso--I don't say I did, mind--it's\r\nbecause my knife went in farther than I intended.'\r\n\r\n'But why did you use it at all?'\r\n\r\n'I didn't. If I had, it would have been because he drew his against me.'\r\n\r\n'And why should he have done so?'\r\n\r\n'_Ventrebleu!_ for as many reasons as there are craft in the harbor.'\r\n\r\n'For example?'\r\n\r\n'Well, that I should have got a place in a ship's company that he was\r\ntrying for.'\r\n\r\n'Such things as that? is it possible?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, for smaller things. That a lass should have given me a dozen\r\noranges she had promised him.'\r\n\r\n'How odd!' said Madame Bernier, with a shrill kind of laugh. 'A man who\r\nowed you a grudge of this kind would just come up and stab you, I\r\nsuppose, and think nothing of it?'\r\n\r\n'Precisely. Drive a knife up to the hilt into your back, with an oath,\r\nand slice open a melon with it, with a song, five minutes afterward.'\r\n\r\n'And when a person is afraid, or ashamed, or in some way unable to take\r\nrevenge himself, does he--or it may be a woman--does she, get some one\r\nelse to do it for her?'\r\n\r\n'_Parbleu!_ Poor devils on the lookout for such work are as plentiful\r\nall along the South American coast as _commissionaires_ on the street\r\ncorners here.' The ferryman was evidently surprised at the fascination\r\npossessed by this infamous topic for so lady-like a person; but having,\r\nas you see, a very ready tongue, it is probable that his delight in\r\nbeing able to give her information and hear himself talk were still\r\ngreater. 'And then down there,' he went on, 'they never forget a grudge.\r\nIf a fellow doesn't serve you one day, he'll do it another. A Spaniard's\r\nhatred is like lost sleep--you can put it off for a time, but it will\r\ngripe you in the end. The rascals always keep their promises to\r\nthemselves.... An enemy on shipboard is jolly fun. It's like bulls\r\ntethered in the same field. You can't stand still half a minute except\r\nagainst a wall. Even when he makes friends with you, his favors never\r\ntaste right. Messing with him is like drinking out of a pewter mug. And\r\nso it is everywhere. Let your shadow once flit across a Spaniard's path,\r\nand he'll always see it there. If you've never lived in any but these\r\ndamned clockworky European towns, you can't imagine the state of things\r\nin a South American seaport--one half the population waiting round the\r\ncorner for the other half. But I don't see that it's so much better\r\nhere, where every man's a spy on every other. There you meet an assassin\r\nat every turn, here a _sergent de ville_..... At all events, the life\r\n_là bas_ used to remind me, more than anything else, of sailing in a\r\nshallow channel, where you don't know what infernal rock you may ground\r\non. Every man has a standing account with his neighbor, just as madame\r\nhas at her _fournisseur's_; and, _ma foi_, those are the only accounts\r\nthey settle. The master of the _Santiago_ may pay me one of these days\r\nfor the pretty names I heaved after him when we parted company, but\r\nhe'll never pay me my wages.'\r\n\r\nA short pause followed this exposition of the virtues of the Spaniard.\r\n\r\n'You yourself never put a man out of the world, then?' resumed Hortense.\r\n\r\n'Oh, _que si_!.... Are you horrified?'\r\n\r\n'Not at all. I know that the thing is often justifiable.'\r\n\r\nThe man was silent a moment, perhaps with surprise, for the next thing\r\nhe said was:\r\n\r\n'Madame is Spanish?'\r\n\r\n'In that, perhaps, I am,' replied Hortense.\r\n\r\nAgain her companion was silent. The pause was prolonged. Madame Bernier\r\nbroke it by a question which showed that she had been following the same\r\ntrain of thought.\r\n\r\n'What is sufficient ground in this country for killing a man?'\r\n\r\nThe boatman sent a loud laugh over the water. Hortense drew her cloak\r\ncloser about her.\r\n\r\n'I'm afraid there is none.'\r\n\r\n'Isn't there a right of self-defence?'\r\n\r\n'To be sure there is--it's one I ought to know something about. But it's\r\none that _ces messieurs_ at the Palais make short work with.'\r\n\r\n'In South America and those countries, when a man makes life\r\ninsupportable to you, what do you do?'\r\n\r\n'_Mon Dieu_! I suppose you kill him.'\r\n\r\n'And in France?'\r\n\r\n'I suppose you kill yourself. Ha! ha! ha!'\r\n\r\nBy this time they had reached the end of the great breakwater,\r\nterminating in a lighthouse, the limit, on one side, of the inner\r\nharbor. The sun had set.\r\n\r\n'Here we are at the lighthouse,' said the man; 'it's growing dark. Shall\r\nwe turn?'\r\n\r\nHortense rose in her place a few moments, and stood looking out to sea.\r\n'Yes,' she said at last, 'you may go back--slowly.' When the boat had\r\nheaded round she resumed her old position, and put one of her hands over\r\nthe side, drawing it through the water as they moved, and gazing into\r\nthe long ripples.\r\n\r\nAt last she looked up at her companion. Now that her face caught some of\r\nthe lingering light of the west, he could see that it was deathly pale.\r\n\r\n'You find it hard to get along in the world,' said she; 'I shall be very\r\nglad to help you.'\r\n\r\nThe man started, and stared a moment. Was it because this remark jarred\r\nupon the expression which he was able faintly to discern in her eyes?\r\nThe next, he put his hand to his cap.\r\n\r\n'Madame is very kind. What will you do?'\r\n\r\nMadame Bernier returned his gaze.\r\n\r\n'I will trust you.'\r\n\r\n'Ah!'\r\n\r\n'And reward you.'\r\n\r\n'Ah? Madame has a piece of work for me?'\r\n\r\n'A piece of work,' Hortense nodded.\r\n\r\nThe man said nothing, waiting apparently for an explanation. His face\r\nwore the look of lowering irritation which low natures feel at being\r\npuzzled.\r\n\r\n'Are you a bold man?'\r\n\r\nLight seemed to come in this question. The quick expansion of his\r\nfeatures answered it. You cannot touch upon certain subjects with an\r\ninferior but by the sacrifice of the barrier which separates you from\r\nhim. There are thoughts and feelings and glimpses and foreshadowings of\r\nthoughts which level all inequalities of station.\r\n\r\n'I'm bold enough,' said the boatman, 'for anything _you_ want me to do.'\r\n\r\n'Are you bold enough to commit a crime?'\r\n\r\n'Not for nothing.'\r\n\r\n'If I ask you to endanger your peace of mind, to risk your personal\r\nsafety for me, it is certainly not as a favor. I will give you ten times\r\nthe weight in gold of every grain by which your conscience grows heavier\r\nin my service.'\r\n\r\nThe man gave her a long, hard look through the dim light.\r\n\r\n'I know what you want me to do,' he said at last.\r\n\r\n'Very well,' said Hortense; 'will you do it?'\r\n\r\nHe continued to gaze. She met his eyes like a woman who has nothing more\r\nto conceal.\r\n\r\n'State your case.'\r\n\r\n'Do you know a vessel named the _Armorique_, a steamer?'\r\n\r\n'Yes; it runs from Southampton.'\r\n\r\n'It will arrive to-morrow morning early. Will it be able to cross the\r\nbar?'\r\n\r\n'No; not till noon.'\r\n\r\n'I thought so. I expect a person by it--a man.'\r\n\r\nMadame Bernier appeared unable to continue, as if her voice had given\r\nway.\r\n\r\n'Well, well?' said her companion.\r\n\r\n'He's the person'--she stopped again.\r\n\r\n'The person who--?'\r\n\r\n'The person whom I wish to get rid of.'\r\n\r\nFor some moments nothing was said. The boatman was the first to speak\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n'Have you formed a plan?'\r\n\r\nHortense nodded.\r\n\r\n'Let's hear it.'\r\n\r\n'The person in question,' said Madame Bernier, 'will be impatient to\r\nland before noon. The house to which he returns will be in view of the\r\nvessel if, as you say, she lies at anchor. If he can get a boat, he will\r\nbe sure to come ashore. _Eh bien_!--but you understand me.'\r\n\r\n'Aha! you mean my boat--_this_ boat?'\r\n\r\n'O God!'\r\n\r\nMadame Bernier sprang up in her seat, threw out her arms, and sank down\r\nagain, burying her face in her knees. Her companion hastily shipped his\r\noars, and laid his hands on her shoulders.\r\n\r\n'_Allons donc_, in the devil's name, don't break down,' said he; 'we'll\r\ncome to an understanding.'\r\n\r\nKneeling in the bottom of the boat, and supporting her by his grasp, he\r\nsucceeded in making her raise herself, though her head still drooped.\r\n\r\n'You want me to finish him in the boat?'\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\n'Is he an old man?'\r\n\r\nHortense shook her head faintly.\r\n\r\n'My age?'\r\n\r\nShe nodded.\r\n\r\n'_Sapristi_! it isn't so easy.'\r\n\r\n'He can't swim,' said Hortense, without looking up; 'he--he is lame.'\r\n\r\n'_Nom de Dieu_!' The boatman dropped his hands. Hortense looked up\r\nquickly. Do you read the pantomime?\r\n\r\n'Never mind,' added the man at last, 'it will serve as a sign.'\r\n\r\n'_Mais oui_. And besides that, he will ask to be taken to the Maison\r\nBernier, the house with its back to the water, on the extension of the\r\ngreat quay. _Tenez_, you can almost see it from here.'\r\n\r\n'I know the place,' said the boatman, and was silent, as if asking and\r\nanswering himself a question.\r\n\r\nHortense was about to interrupt the train of thought which she\r\napprehended he was following, when he forestalled her.\r\n\r\n'How am I to be sure of my affair?' asked he.\r\n\r\n'Of your reward? I've thought of that. This watch is a pledge of what I\r\nshall be able and glad to give you afterward. There are two thousand\r\nfrancs' worth of pearls in the case.'\r\n\r\n'_Il faut fixer la somme_,' said the man, leaving the watch untouched.\r\n\r\n'That lies with you.'\r\n\r\n'Good. You know that I have the right to ask a high price.'\r\n\r\n'Certainly. Name it.'\r\n\r\n'It's only on the supposition of a large sum that I will so much as\r\nconsider your proposal. _Songez donc_, that it's a MURDER you\r\nask of me.'\r\n\r\n'The price--the price?'\r\n\r\n'_Tenez_,' continued the man, 'poached game is always high. The pearls\r\nin that watch are costly because it's worth a man's life to get at them.\r\nYou want me to be your pearl diver. Be it so. You must guarantee me a\r\nsafe descent,--it's a descent, you know--ha!--you must furnish me the\r\narmor of safety; a little gap to breathe through while I'm at my\r\nwork--the thought of a capful of Napoleons!'\r\n\r\n'My good man, I don't wish to talk to you or to listen to your sallies.\r\nI wish simply to know your price. I'm not bargaining for a pair of\r\nchickens. Propose a sum.'\r\n\r\nThe boatman had by this time resumed his seat and his oars. He stretched\r\nout for a long, slow pull, which brought him closely face to face with\r\nhis temptress. This position, his body bent forward, his eyes fixed on\r\nMadame Bernier's face, he kept for some seconds. It was perhaps\r\nfortunate for Hortense's purpose at that moment--it had often aided her\r\npurposes before--that she was a pretty woman.[C] A plain face might have\r\nemphasized the utterly repulsive nature of the negotiation. Suddenly,\r\nwith a quick, convulsive movement, the man completed the stroke.\r\n\r\n'_Pas si hête_! propose one yourself.'\r\n\r\n'Very well,' said Hortense, 'if you wish it, _Voyons_: I'll give you\r\nwhat I can. I have fifteen thousand francs' worth of jewels. I'll give\r\nyou them, or, if they will get you into trouble, their value. At home,\r\nin a box I have a thousand francs in gold. You shall have those. I'll\r\npay your passage and outfit to America, I have friends in New York. I'll\r\nwrite to them to get you work.'\r\n\r\n'And you'll give your washing to my mother and sister, _hein_? Ha! ha!\r\nJewels, fifteen thousand francs; one thousand more makes sixteen;\r\npassage to America--first class--five hundred francs; outfit--what does\r\nMadame understand by that?'\r\n\r\n'Everything needful for your success _là-bas_.'\r\n\r\n'A written denial that I am an assassin? _Ma foi_, it were better not to\r\nremove the impression. It's served me a good turn, on this side of the\r\nwater at least. Call it twenty-five thousand francs.'\r\n\r\n'Very well; but not a sous more.'\r\n\r\n'Shall I trust you?'\r\n\r\n'Am I not trusting you? It is well for you that I do not allow myself to\r\nthink of the venture I am making.'\r\n\r\n'Perhaps we're even there. We neither of us can afford to make account\r\nof certain possibilities. Still, I'll trust you, too.... _Tiens_!' added\r\nthe boatman, 'here we are near the quay.' Then with a mock-solemn touch\r\nof his cap, 'Will Madame still visit the cemetery?'\r\n\r\n'Come, quick, let me land,' said Madame Bernier, impatiently.\r\n\r\n'We _have_ been among the dead, after a fashion,' persisted the boatman,\r\nas he gave her his hand.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nIt was more than eight o'clock when Madame Bernier reached her own\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n'Has M. de Meyrau been here?' she asked of Josephine.\r\n\r\n'Yes, ma'am; and on learning that Madame was out, he left a note, _chez\r\nmonsieur_.'\r\n\r\nHortense found a sealed letter on the table in her husband's old study.\r\nIt ran as follows:\r\n\r\n     'I was desolated at finding you out. I had a word to tell you. I\r\n     have accepted an invitation to sup and pass the night at C----,\r\n     thinking it would look well. For the same reason I have resolved to\r\n     take the bull by the horns, and go aboard the steamer on my return,\r\n     to welcome M. Bernier home--the privilege of an old friend. I am\r\n     told the _Armorique_ will anchor off the bar by daybreak. What do\r\n     you think? But it's too late to let me know. Applaud my _savoir\r\n     faire_--you will, at all events, in the end. You will see how it\r\n     will smoothe matters.'\r\n\r\n'Baffled! baffled!' hissed Madame, when she had read the note; 'God\r\ndeliver me from my friends!' She paced up and down the room several\r\ntimes, and at last began to mutter to herself, as people often do in\r\nmoments of strong emotion: 'Bah! but he'll never get up by daybreak.\r\nHe'll oversleep himself, especially after to-night's supper. The other\r\nwill be before him..... Oh, my poor head, you've suffered too much to\r\nfail in the end!'\r\n\r\nJosephine reappeared to offer to remove her mistress's things. The\r\nlatter, in her desire to reassure herself, asked the first question that\r\noccurred to her.\r\n\r\n'Was M. le Vicomte alone?'\r\n\r\n'No, madame; another gentleman was with him--M. de Saulges, I think.\r\nThey came in a hack, with two portmanteaus.'\r\n\r\nThough I have judged best, hitherto, often from an exaggerated fear of\r\ntrenching on the ground of fiction, to tell you what this poor lady did\r\nand said, rather than what she thought, I may disclose what passed in\r\nher mind now:\r\n\r\n'Is he a coward? is he going to leave me? or is he simply going to pass\r\nthese last hours in play and drink? He might have stayed with me. Ah! my\r\nfriend, you do little for me, who do so much for you; who commit murder,\r\nand--Heaven help me!--suicide for you!.... But I suppose he knows best.\r\nAt all events, he will make a night of it.'\r\n\r\nWhen the cook came in late that evening, Josephine, who had sat up for\r\nher, said:\r\n\r\n'You've no idea how Madame is looking. She's ten years older since this\r\nmorning. Holy mother! what a day this has been for her!'\r\n\r\n'Wait till to-morrow,' said the oracular Valentine.\r\n\r\nLater, when the women went up to bed in the attic, they saw a light\r\nunder Hortense's door, and during the night Josephine, whose chamber was\r\nabove Madame's, and who couldn't sleep (for sympathy, let us say), heard\r\nmovements beneath her, which told that her mistress was even more\r\nwakeful than she.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nThere was considerable bustle around the _Armorique_ as she anchored\r\noutside the harbor of H----, in the early dawn of the following day. A\r\ngentleman, with an overcoat, walking stick, and small valise, came\r\nalongside in a little fishing boat, and got leave to go aboard.\r\n\r\n'Is M. Bernier here?' he asked of one of the officers, the first man he\r\nmet.\r\n\r\n'I fancy he's gone ashore, sir. There was a boatman inquiring for him a\r\nfew minutes ago, and I think he carried him off.\r\n\r\nM. de Meyrau reflected a moment. Then he crossed over to the other side\r\nof the vessel, looking landward. Leaning over the bulwarks he saw an\r\nempty boat moored to the ladder which ran up the vessel's side.\r\n\r\n'That's a town boat, isn't it?' he said to one of the hands standing by.\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Where's the master?'\r\n\r\n'I suppose he'll be here in a moment. I saw him speaking to one of the\r\nofficers just now.'\r\n\r\nDe Meyrau descended the ladder, and seated himself at the stern of the\r\nboat. As the sailor he had just addressed was handing down his bag, a\r\nface with a red cap looked over the bulwarks.\r\n\r\n'Hullo, my man!' cried De Meyrau, 'is this your boat?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir, at your service,' answered the red cap, coming to the top of\r\nthe ladder, and looking hard at the gentleman's stick and portmanteau.\r\n\r\n'Can you take me to town, to Madame Bernier's, at the end of the new\r\nquay?'\r\n\r\n'Certainly, sir,' said the boatman, scuttling down the ladder, 'you're\r\njust the gentleman I want.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn hour later Hortense Bernier came out of the house, and began to walk\r\nslowly through the garden toward the terrace which overlooked the water.\r\nThe servants, when they came down at an early hour, had found her up and\r\ndressed, or rather, apparently, not undressed, for she wore the same\r\nclothes as the evening before.\r\n\r\n'_Tiens!_' exclaimed Josephine, after seeing her, 'Madame gained ten\r\nyears yesterday; she has gained ten more during the night.'\r\n\r\nWhen Madame Bernier reached the middle of the garden she halted, and\r\nstood for a moment motionless, listening. The next, she uttered a great\r\ncry. For she saw a figure emerge from below the terrace, and come\r\nlimping toward her with outstretched arms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'NOS AMIS LES COSAQUES!'\r\n\r\n     [In accordance with the policy embraced by THE\r\n     CONTINENTAL, of giving views of important subjects from\r\n     various stand-points, we lay before our readers the following\r\n     article. It is from the pen which contributed to the 'New American\r\n     Cyclopædia' the articles 'Czartoryski,' 'Francis Joseph,' 'G[=o]rgey,'\r\n     'Hebrews,' 'Hungary,' 'Kossuth,' 'Poland,' etc., etc. We doubt not\r\n     the author gives utterance in the present contribution to the\r\n     feelings which agitated the hearts of thousands of our naturalized\r\n     citizens during the Russian excitement in New York. Heartily\r\n     grateful as we may be to Russia for her timely sympathy, our\r\n     country is pledged to Eternal Justice, and ought never to forget\r\n     that she is the hope of mankind, and should be its model.]\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the thirtieth of November last, the large hall\r\nof the Cooper Institute--that forum of public opinion in the city\r\nof New York, which has so often been the theatre of interesting\r\nmanifestations--witnessed a scene almost entirely novel. Flags,\r\ndecorated with emblems unknown, were unfolded over the platform; young\r\ngirls, daughters of a distant land, or at least of exiles from it,\r\nappeared in their national costume, and sang melodious strains in a\r\nforeign tongue, which charmed tears into the eyes of those who\r\nunderstood them; a straightened scythe, fixed to the end of a pole, was\r\nexhibited, not as a specimen of the agricultural implements of the\r\ncountry from which those homeless men and children had sprung, but as a\r\nweapon with which its people, in absence of more efficient arms, was\r\nwont to fight for liberty and independence; the bust of the father of\r\nthe American republic was placed prominently in face of the large\r\ngathering, and at its side that of a man bearing the features of a\r\ndifferent race, and apparently not less revered.\r\n\r\nIf I say that this man was Kosciuszko, I have explained all. Every\r\nreader not entirely ignorant of history will know which was the land,\r\nthe people, what the meaning of the weapon, of the song. Who has never\r\nyet wept over the narrative of the fall of that unhappy country east and\r\nwest of the Vistula, so shamelessly torn, quartered, and preyed upon by\r\nravenous neighboring empires? Whose heart has never yet throbbed with\r\nadmiration for the sons of that land who to this day protest with their\r\nblood, poured in streams, against that greatest of all crimes recorded\r\nin history, the partition of their country, and that blasphemous lie\r\nwritten upon one of its bloodiest pages: _Finis Poloniæ_? who, abandoned\r\nby the world, betrayed by their neighbors, trampled upon as no nation\r\never was before, again and again rise, and in 1794, under the lead of\r\nKosciuszko, eclipse the deeds of those who, in 1768, flocked to the\r\nbanners of Pulaski; in 1830-'31, on the battle fields of Grochow and\r\nOstrolenka, show themselves more powerful than under the dictatorship of\r\nthe disciple of Washington, and in 1863, fighting without a leader,\r\nwithout a centre, without arms, surprise the world with a heroism, a\r\nself-sacrificing devotion, unexampled even in the history of their\r\nformer insurrections? Who has never heard of Russian batteries assaulted\r\nand carried by Polish scythes? Whose bosom is so devoid of the divine\r\ncords of justice and sympathy as never yet to have revibrated the strain\r\nof the Polish exiles: POLAND IS NOT YET LOST?\r\n\r\nAlas, the chronological dates just touched upon embrace a century! For a\r\nhundred years Poland writhes in heroic despair under the heels of\r\nMuscovite despotism, dazzles mankind by sublime efforts to recover her\r\nright to national life, liberty, and happiness, and _not a hand has been\r\nstretched out to help her break her chains_! All her martyrdom wrests\r\nfrom the better nature of mankind is a tear of mourning, when, after a\r\nsuperhuman struggle, she again sinks exhausted, and is believed to sink\r\ninto the grave. And has Poland well deserved this heartless\r\nindifference, this pitilessness of the nations? Has she delivered none?\r\naided none? served none? defended none? Answer, Vienna, rescued from the\r\nTurkish yoke by John Sobieski! Answer, thou monument at West Point, thou\r\nfort at the mouth of the Savannah, ye towns and counties named\r\nKosciuszko and Pulaski! Answer, Elba and St. Helena! Answer, Hungarian\r\ncompanion-in-arms of Bern, Dembinski, and Wysocki! Answer, Germany,\r\nEurope, Christendom, for centuries shielded by Polish valor against\r\nTartar barbarism and Moslem fanaticism!\r\n\r\nAlas, Poland must beg even for sympathy! That gathering, which\r\ncommemorated, on its thirty-third anniversary, the outbreak of the\r\nrising of 1830, was destined to resuscitate the feeling of the American\r\npeople for the Polish cause. For the Poles sojourning in this country\r\nhad reasons to believe that even that passive sentiment was on the wane,\r\nthat interests, not less illusory than selfish, were working to destroy\r\neven the impressions which sacred national remembrances, by twining\r\ntogether the memories of Washington and Kosciuszko, had created in the\r\nAmerican heart. Strange to say, amid the roar of cannon thundering\r\nfreedom to slaves, amid streams of blood shed in the name of\r\nnationality, on this side of the Atlantic, amid daily echoes\r\nreverberating the groans of butchered martyrs, of mothers and sisters\r\nscourged, hanged, or dragged into captivity, on the other side--New York\r\nhad gone mad with enthusiasm for the Muscovites! The metropolis of the\r\nfreest people on the globe had prostrated herself before the shrine of\r\nsemi-Asiatic despotism, had kissed the hands of the knoutbearers of the\r\nczar, had desecrated the holy memory of Washington, by coupling his\r\nname, his bust, with those of an Alexander, nay, of a Nicholas! The woes\r\nof Poland were forgotten, her cause was wantonly assailed, her fair\r\nname defamed by the very same organs of public opinion which for months\r\nand months made people shudder with daily recitals of nameless\r\natrocities committed by the Russian hangmen, by the Muravieffs and\r\nAunekoffs, on the defenders of their country and liberty. Unthinking\r\nscribblers and lecturers called Russia and America twin sister empires\r\nof the future, agitated for an alliance defensive and offensive between\r\nthem; Poland and her defenders were calumniated. _Væ victis!_\r\n\r\nThere is an excuse for every folly New York commits and the country\r\nimitates, for she is blessed with papers and politicians more than\r\nothers practised to flatter vanity and mislead ignorance. When New York\r\nstrews palm leaves before the feet of the Prince of Wales, it is done to\r\ncement the bond of love that links the New World to its venerable\r\nmother; when she runs after the Japanese, it is in search of a\r\ntrans-oceanic brother, just discovered, and soon lovingly to be embraced\r\n(witness our doings in the Japanese waters); when she kisses the knout\r\nand collects Russian relics, it is done to inaugurate a sistership of\r\nthe future, already dawning upon her in Muscovite smiles of friendship,\r\nin diplomatic hints of the czar, and in the hurrahs for the Union of\r\nLissoffski's crews! In this case she only pays with American sympathy\r\nfor Russian sympathy, and at the same time frowns a rebuke upon England\r\nand France for their un-Russian-like behavior, and insinuates a threat\r\nwhich may save this country from the perils of European intervention.\r\n\r\nBut Russian imperial sympathy, with its diplomatic smiles and compulsory\r\nhurrahs, is nothing but a bait; he must be blind who does not see it.\r\nWhat is the natural tendency that would lead the czar, the upholder of\r\ndespotism in the East, to sympathize with the model republic of the\r\nWest? the empire which is again and again covered with the blood of\r\nPoland, divided by it and its accomplices, to have, amid its troubles,\r\nso much tender feeling for the indivisibility of this country? Is\r\nAlexander's friendship kindled by our acts of emancipation? It is true\r\nhe has freed more than twenty millions of serfs in his empire, and,\r\nthough following the dictates of political necessity, he may have acted\r\nwith no more real anti-slavery sentiment than that which makes many\r\navowed pro-slavery men emancipationists among ourselves, yet he\r\ncertainly has achieved a noble glory, which even his monstrous reign in\r\nPoland may not entirely blot out from the pages of history. The same\r\nfriendly disposition toward the United States was, however,\r\nostentatiously evinced by Nicholas, who lived and died the true\r\nrepresentative and guardian of unmitigated tyranny; it was as\r\nostentatiously shown by Alexander at the time when Fremont's\r\nproclamation was repudiated as it is now, after the first of January,\r\n1863; and it is he of all the monarchs of Europe who, as early as July,\r\n1861, diplomatically advised this country to save the Union by\r\ncompromise, as neither of the contending parties could be finally\r\ncrushed down; that is to say, flagrantly to sacrifice _liberty_ in order\r\nto save _power_. The Russian nobility will naturally sympathize with the\r\nslaveholders of the South, and the lower classes of the Russian people\r\nare too ignorant to think about transatlantic affairs. Russian imperial\r\nand diplomatic sympathy will cordially be bestowed upon any nation and\r\ncause which promises to become hostile to England (or, on a given time,\r\nto France), on Nena Sahib no less than on Abraham Lincoln. The\r\nnever-discarded aim of Russia to plant its double cross on the banks of\r\nthe Byzantine Bosporus, and its batteries on those of the Hellespont,\r\nand thus to transfer its centre of gravity from the secluded shores of\r\nthe Baltic to the gates of the Mediterranean; the never-slumbering dread\r\nof this expansion, which has made the integrity of Turkey an inviolable\r\nprinciple with the British statesmen of every sect; and the growing\r\ninevitability of a bloody collision on the fields of central Asia of the\r\ntwo powers, one of which is master of the north, and the other of the\r\nsouth of that continent, have rendered Russia and Great Britain\r\ninveterate foes. To strengthen itself against its deadliest opponent,\r\none courts the alliance of France, the other that of the American Union,\r\nboth not from sympathy, but in spite of inveterate or natural antipathy.\r\nAgainst a common enemy we have seen the pope allying himself with the\r\nsultan. Russia always hates England, and from time to time fears France;\r\nboth these powers continue to offend the United States, and at least one\r\nof them now threatens a Polish campaign: why should not the czar lavish\r\nhis flattering marks of friendship on a great power which he hopes to\r\nentice into an unnatural alliance? It is not American freedom which the\r\nczars are fond of; they court American power as naturally antagonistic\r\nto that of England, at least on the seas. Wielded entire by a Jeff.\r\nDavis, with all the Southern spirit of aggression, it would be to them a\r\nmore desirable object of an _entente cordiale_.\r\n\r\nBut why should we not accept the proffered aid, though the offer be\r\nprompted by selfish motives? Threatened by a wicked interference in our\r\naffairs, which might prove dangerous to our national existence, why\r\nrefuse additional means to guard it, though these be derived from an\r\nimpure source? Will an innocent man, attacked by assassins, repulse the\r\naid of one hastening to save him, on the ground that he, too, is a\r\nmurderer? Certainly not. History, too, proves it by noble examples.\r\nPelopidas, the Theban hero, invokes the aid of the Persian king, the\r\nnatural enemy of the Greeks; Cato, who prefers a free death by his own\r\nhand to life under a Cæsar, fights side by side with Juba, a king of\r\nbarbarians; Gustavus Adolphus, the champion of Protestantism in Germany,\r\nacts in concert with Richelieu, the reducer of La Rochelle, its last\r\nstronghold in France; Pulaski, who fights for freedom in Poland and dies\r\nfor it in America, accepts the aid of the sultan; Franklin calls upon\r\nthe master of the Bastille to defend the Declaration of Independence;\r\nYpsilanti raises the standard of Neo-Grecian liberty in hope of aid from\r\nCzar Alexander I, and happier Hellenes obtain it from Czar Nicholas, and\r\nconquer; the heroic defender of Rome in 1849, Garibaldi, fights in 1859,\r\nso to say, under the lead of Louis Napoleon, the destroyer of that\r\nrepublic.\r\n\r\nBut what has all this to do with the question before us? Has it come to\r\nthis? Is the cause of this great republic reduced to such extremities?\r\nIs this nation of twenty millions of freemen, so richly endowed with all\r\nthe faculties, resources, and artificial means which constitute power,\r\nunable to preserve its national existence, independence, and liberty,\r\nwithout help from the contaminating hand of tyranny, without sacrificing\r\nits honor by basely singing hosannas to the imperial butcher of Poland,\r\nat the very moment when the blood of the people of Kosciuszko and\r\nPulaski cries to Heaven and mankind for vengeance? Is the peril so\r\ngreat? so imminent? Is Hannibal _ante portas_? Has the French fleet\r\ndispersed Secretary Welles's five hundred and eighty-eight vessels of\r\nwar, broken the Southern blockade, and appeared before our Northern\r\nharbors? Are all Jeff. Davis's bitter complaints against the English\r\ncabinet but a sham, covering a deep-laid conspiracy with treacherous\r\nAlbion? Is Emperor Maximilian quietly seated on the throne of Montezuma,\r\nand already marching his armies upon the Rio Grande? The talk of foreign\r\nintervention has been going on for years, and not a threatening cloud is\r\nyet to be seen on our horizon. Both England and France deprecate the\r\nidea of hostile interference in American affairs. It is _Russia_ that\r\nis _menaced_, an alliance with her can serve only herself, and her\r\nartifices have caused all the foolish clamor that threatens to disgrace\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\nAnd then, accepting aid is not forming an alliance, still less an\r\nalliance _defensive_ and _offensive_. Not to speak of examples too\r\nremote, every one familiar with the historical characters of the men,\r\nwill know that neither Pulaski, Franklin, Ypsilanti, or Garibaldi would\r\never have so degraded his cause--the cause of liberty--as to promise to\r\nthe despot, whose aid he desired, a compensatory assistance in trampling\r\ndown a people rising for freedom. No _innocent_ man attacked by\r\nassassins will promise, with honest intent, to one who offers to save\r\nhim, his assistance in continuing a work of murder and resisting the arm\r\nof justice.\r\n\r\nFor it must be supposed that nobody is foolish enough to believe that\r\nRussia would offer us her aid--say, against France--without requiring\r\nfrom us a mutual service; that merely in order to inflict a punishment\r\non Louis Napoleon for the recognition of the South, or the establishment\r\nof monarchy in Mexico, she would, still bleeding from the wounds\r\ninflicted by the Polish insurrection, madly launch her armies upon the\r\nRhine, or start her hiding fleet from behind the fortified shelters of\r\nCronstadt and Helsingfors, make it pass the Sound and Skager Rack,\r\nunmindful of the frowning batteries of Landscrona and Marstrand, pass\r\nthe Strait of Dover, and the English Channel, and enter the Atlantic,\r\nquietly leaving behind Calais, Boulogne, Cherbourg, and Brest, and all\r\nthis with the certainty of raising a storm which might carry the armies\r\nof France and her allies into the heart of Poland, and ultimately, by\r\nrestoring that country, press czardom back, where it ought to be, behind\r\nthe Dnieper. Such assistance she would and could not honestly promise\r\nwere we even to vouch a similar boon to her in case Napoleon should\r\nreally enter upon a campaign for the deliverance of Poland. For neither\r\npromise could be executed with the slightest chance of real success, and\r\nwithout exposing the naval and land forces despatched across the seas to\r\nalmost certain total destruction. The only practical military result of\r\na Russo-American alliance could be an attack by the forces of the United\r\nStates on the French in Mexico, serving as a powerful diversion for the\r\nbenefit of Russia assailed by France in Europe. This is what Russia\r\nknows and our eager demonstrationists are unable to perceive. The sword\r\nof France hangs over Russia, just engaged in finishing the slaughter of\r\nPoland. The menace of a Russo-American alliance may induce Napoleon, who\r\nis entangled in Mexico, to put that sword back into the scabbard. He is\r\ntoo proud and too little magnanimous to give up, yielding to our menace,\r\nhis Mexican work--a work so long begun, and so costly in blood and\r\ntreasure--and turn all his attention, all his forces toward Poland and\r\nRussia. He may give up Poland, for which he has not yet sacrificed\r\nanything, and turn all his attention toward Mexico and the United\r\nStates. Thus our philo-Russian enthusiasm can bear no good fruits for\r\nourselves; it can serve Russia, prevent the deliverance of Poland, and\r\ndishonor the fair name of the American republic.\r\n\r\nYes, dishonor it. Already, speaking of the demonstrations in favor of\r\nthe Russians, that patriot soldier, Sigel, exclaims: 'They make me\r\nalmost doubt the common sense of the American people.' And it is not\r\nSigel that speaks thus: it is the voice of enlightened Germany, of the\r\nfreedom-loving men of Europe.\r\n\r\nMay the people of America heed this warning before it is too late!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAS HE SUCCESSFUL?\r\n\r\n_PART THE LAST._\r\n\r\n     'Do but grasp into the thick of human life! Everyone _lives_ it--to\r\n     not many is it _known_; and seize it where you will, it is\r\n     interesting'--GOETHE.\r\n\r\n     'SUCCESSFUL.--Terminating in accomplishing what is wished\r\n     or intended.'--WEBSTER'S _Dictionary_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.--_continued._\r\n\r\nAs soon as they reached the room, Mrs. Meeker exclaimed, 'Augustus! tell\r\nme, what does this mean!'\r\n\r\nThe young man, thus appealed to, stopped, and, regarding his mother with\r\na fierce expression, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n'It means that I quit New York to-night!'\r\n\r\n'Augustus! you are a cruel creature to alarm me in this way.'\r\n\r\n'It is so, mother. I have got into a bad scrape.'\r\n\r\n'Tell me just what it is, Augustus--tell me the whole truth.'\r\n\r\n'Well, a few weeks ago, I lost a large sum of money--no matter how. I\r\nasked father to help me. I made him a solemn promise, which I would have\r\nkept, provided he had given me what I required. He refused, and I used\r\nhis name to raise it.'\r\n\r\n'O Augustus! Augustus!' exclaimed Mrs. Meeker in genuine agony.\r\n\r\n'It's no use groaning over it,' said the young man. 'It is done; and,\r\nwhat is worse, it is discovered! Father will know it to-night. What I\r\nwant is, money enough to take me out of the country; and if you will not\r\ngive it to me, I will cut my throat before you leave the room!'\r\n\r\nMrs. Meeker could only reply by sobs and hysterical exclamations.\r\n\r\n'It is of no use, mother--I mean it!' continued the young man.\r\n\r\n'Where are you going, Augustus?' said Mrs. Meeker, faintly.\r\n\r\n'Across the water. Give me the money, and I shall be on board ship in an\r\nhour.'\r\n\r\n'I have only two hundred dollars in my purse,' said his mother,\r\nmournfully, producing it.\r\n\r\n'It will serve my purpose,' answered her son. 'You can send me more\r\nafter you hear from me.'\r\n\r\nHe took the money and put it into his pocket, and prepared to attend his\r\nmother to the door.\r\n\r\n'But when shall I see you again, Augustus?' faltered Mrs. Meeker.\r\n\r\n'Never!'\r\n\r\nThe parental feeling could no longer be restrained. She threw herself\r\nupon her son's neck, sobbing violently, and declared he should not leave\r\nher.\r\n\r\nIt did not avail. Although the young man's feelings seemed much\r\nsoftened, he resisted all her appeals. He unwound her arms with\r\ntenderness, and led her in silence down the staircase.\r\n\r\n'Give my love to Harriet,' he said. 'Tell her I never will forget her.'\r\n\r\nHe opened the door into the street--a moment after, he had regained his\r\nroom; and the miserable mother was driven back to her magnificent abode.\r\n\r\nThe next day an ordinary sailing vessel left New York for Liverpool,\r\nhaving on board the only son of Hiram Meeker.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Meeker reached her house, her husband had finished his dinner,\r\nand gone out. It was late when he returned--so late, that his wife had\r\nalready retired.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, Mr. Meeker communicated to her the information of his\r\nson's disgraceful and criminal conduct. She listened with such an air of\r\nsorrow and distress, that it did not occur to him that she manifested no\r\nsurprise. She prudently, perhaps, forbore communicating the incidents\r\nof the previous evening, for she knew it would lead to a terrible\r\nreproof on his part. Besides, her present interference was far beyond\r\nanything she had ever ventured on, and she stood in great terror of\r\nHiram where important matters were concerned.\r\n\r\nDuring the day, Hiram Meeker had intelligence of his son's flight. He\r\nreceived it with great outward composure, and with sensible inward\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the fraud which Augustus had committed had also been\r\nborne with entire equanimity.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, Hiram, having thought best to conclude that his son was\r\nirreclaimable, searched the Scriptures to find the various eminent\r\nexamples of disobedient, ungrateful, and wicked children; and he seemed\r\nto cherish with unction the idea of being numbered among the godly\r\nparents of a reprobate child.\r\n\r\nHis own position was so strong, so far above that of any ordinary man of\r\nwealth, that the circumstance of a dissolute son's raising a few\r\nthousand dollars by forging his name (after all, it was only a few\r\nthousand) could only produce an expression of sympathy for the honored\r\nfather.\r\n\r\nWhat to do with Augustus--that was the question which troubled him\r\nthrough the night; and the morning brought an agreeable solution of it.\r\n\r\nHis child, an only son, possessed of many noble and generous qualities,\r\nwithout any of his father's intense selfishness, was a wanderer and an\r\noutcast on the earth, and he unmoved, undisturbed, complacent!\r\n\r\nIt was soon known in the house what had become of Augustus. When Belle\r\nheard of it, she gave a shrug, and exclaimed, 'Poor Gus!'\r\n\r\nHarriet, the invalid, was deeply affected. Seeing how much she was\r\nsorrowing, her mother, whose heart was still tender from the\r\nrecollection of her late parting with her boy, told her, under promise\r\nof secrecy (she knew she could trust her), that she had seen Augustus\r\nbefore he went away, and repeated the message with which she had been\r\ncharged.\r\n\r\n'O mamma!' exclaimed the poor girl, 'we can save him--I know we can! You\r\nsay he is to write you. We shall know where he is, and by-and-by he will\r\ncome back.'\r\n\r\n'Your father will never permit it.'\r\n\r\n'Perhaps not immediately; but he will yield--I am sure he will yield.'\r\n\r\n'You do not know him as I know him,' said Mrs. Meeker, in a tone so\r\nsepulchral, that it made her daughter start. 'He will never\r\nyield--_never!_'\r\n\r\nI think from that period the conduct of Mrs. Meeker toward her daughter\r\nwas much less indifferent, not to say harsh, than it had previously\r\nbeen. Harriet was, in a way, connected with her last recollection of\r\nAugustus. And this spark of a mother's tenderness did, to an extent,\r\nspread a diffusing warmth over her whole nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nHiram Meeker had erected an entire block of buildings, which he called\r\n'model houses for the poor.'\r\n\r\nBy this observation the reader must not suppose I mean that they were\r\nprovided _gratis_ for that ever-present class. No. But they were made on\r\na new plan, so as to give each family comfortable quarters, as if each\r\nhad a house of their own.\r\n\r\nHiram Meeker received great credit for the 'act of benevolence' in\r\nbuilding these homes for poor people. Doubtless it was a very great\r\nimprovement over the old arrangement. Still, Hiram's block of buildings\r\nnetted him just fifteen per cent. per annum, after deducting all\r\npossible charges and expenses against the property.\r\n\r\nTo secure such a handsome return, there had, of course, to be very\r\nstrict and careful management. Hiram's agent in this department was a\r\nman entirely satisfactory to him, and with whom he never interfered.\r\nFrequent complaints were made of this man's severity, to which Hiram\r\nwould pay no attention. It was impossible for him to look after all the\r\ndetails of his various affairs. An agent once appointed, people must\r\ntransact their business with him.\r\n\r\nThis was reasonable, as a rule; but Hiram's iniquity was displayed in\r\nthe nature of the men whom he selected to manage for him. You see he\r\nplaced exacting and relentless folks in charge, and then tried to avoid\r\nthe responsibility of their acts of severity.\r\n\r\nOne day, a few weeks after the circumstances recorded in the last\r\nchapter, Hiram was seated in his inner and very private office, outside\r\nof which was his regular office, where was his confidential clerk; and\r\nbeyond that the counting room of the princely house of 'Hiram\r\nMeeker'--for he admitted no partners--which several rooms were protected\r\nagainst persons having no business to transact with the house, but who\r\nwished to see Mr. Meeker personally.\r\n\r\nThis class found entrance very difficult. They had first to announce the\r\nnature of their business. If it required personal attention, they were\r\nintroduced to a species of general agent, who was high in Mr. Meeker's\r\nconfidence. If this last character was satisfied, then an interview\r\ncould be had with the great man himself.\r\n\r\nI say, one day Hiram was seated in his most private apartment, quite\r\nalone. He was engaged in calculations for some large real-estate\r\nimprovements involving an outlay of at least a million of dollars. He\r\nhad given orders not to be interrupted, and was deeply absorbed in his\r\nplans, when the door opened, and a young man came in with a quick step.\r\n\r\nHiram did not look up. He supposed it was some one connected with the\r\nestablishment.\r\n\r\n'Is this Mr. Meeker?' was asked, in a vigorous, earnest voice.\r\n\r\nHiram raised his head, and beheld an individual apparently\r\nfive-and-twenty, dressed rather carelessly, but in the manner of a\r\ngentleman. He was of goodly proportions, and had dark hair, a clear\r\ncomplexion, and keen gray eyes.\r\n\r\nHiram made no reply to the question, except to ask, 'What is your name?'\r\n\r\n'Dr. Ephraim Peters,' said the young man with the sparkling gray eyes.\r\n\r\n'Who admitted you?' continued Hiram.\r\n\r\n'I had a pressing errand of life and death, and could not wait for a\r\nformal presentation.'\r\n\r\n'What is your business?'\r\n\r\nDr. Peters took a seat with considerable deliberation, while Hiram\r\nwaited, with a displeased look, for him to reply.\r\n\r\n'You are the owner of the block of 'model houses,' as they are called?'\r\n\r\nHiram nodded.\r\n\r\n'A patient of mine, a laboring man, is one of your tenants. He broke his\r\nleg a few months ago, falling from a scaffolding. He has had hard work\r\nto live since. Thursday his wife was taken ill. Yesterday was rent\r\nday--he pays monthly in advance. He could not get the money, and your\r\nagent refuses to give him any grace. Now what I want to say is, the poor\r\nwoman can't be moved without danger to her life.'\r\n\r\n'Well?'\r\n\r\n'Well,' echoed the other, 'I want to get an order from you to let her\r\nremain.'\r\n\r\n'See the agent.'\r\n\r\n'I have seen him; and, what is more, although I am poor enough\r\nmyself--for I am just starting, you see, in New York--I offered to pawn\r\nmy watch and pay the rent myself, but the man would not take it.'\r\n\r\n'No?'\r\n\r\n'No, he would not. He said they had gone over the time, and he did not\r\nwant tenants who depended on charity to pay rent; besides he said he was\r\nafraid the woman was going to die, and he did not want a death in the\r\nbuilding--it would give it a bad name.'\r\n\r\nThe young man paused, with the air of one who had made a successful\r\nargument, and was waiting for an auspicious result.\r\n\r\nThe only notice Hiram took of him was to say, in a decided tone, as he\r\nresumed his calculations, 'I can't interfere.'\r\n\r\n'CAN'T interfere!' said the other, with naive astonishment.\r\n'Why, what do you mean? It will kill the woman, I tell you! You _must_\r\ninterfere.'\r\n\r\n'Young man, you forget yourself. I repeat, go to the agent. I shall not\r\ninterfere.'\r\n\r\n'Well, well,' said the young physician, rising, 'I have heard of hard\r\nhearts and cruel men who grind the faces of the poor, but you are the\r\nfirst I have seen. I don't envy you, though. I would not stand in your\r\nshoes for a good deal.'\r\n\r\nWhile Dr. Ephraim Peters was delivering himself of the above, Hiram had\r\nstruck a small bell which stood before him, and a young man entered in\r\nresponse to the summons just as the doctor concluded.\r\n\r\n'Holmes, send for a policeman.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.' And Holmes withdrew to execute the commission.\r\n\r\n'Do you mean that for me?' exclaimed the young doctor, choking with\r\npassion, while the gray eyes flashed dangerously.\r\n\r\nHiram made no reply, but occupied himself intently with the figures\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\n'I say,' said the other, in a louder tone, 'do you mean that for me? I\r\nsuppose you do, and I have half a mind that the errand shall not be for\r\nnothing. Yes, I have _more_ than half a mind to break every bone in your\r\nworthless body!'\r\n\r\nHe looked at that moment, with his clenched hand, erect figure, and\r\nenergetic presence, quite capable of carrying out the threat.\r\n\r\nStill, Hiram paid not the slightest attention to this demonstration, but\r\nworked at his figures, more abstracted than ever. He knew it was merely\r\na matter of time; the policeman would arrive in two or three minutes,\r\nand, as he hoped, would catch the doctor in the midst of his violent\r\noutburst of passion.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, our young hero soon discovered that he was to get no\r\nsatisfaction from his antagonist, as he now considered him, by the\r\ncourse he was pursuing. He, too, began to count the moments--well aware\r\nthat he had not much time to spare.\r\n\r\nHe determined to change his tactics.\r\n\r\n'After all,' he exclaimed, in a deliberate tone, 'I will not give you\r\nthe chance for a case of assault and battery. I think better of the\r\nwhole matter. Nature is slower, to be sure, but she will do the work\r\nbetter than I could. Do you know what an advantage I have over you? I am\r\ntwenty-five, and you fifty-five. Money cannot buy back those thirty\r\nyears. That's about all I have to say.\r\n\r\n'Not quite, either,' he continued, still more deliberately. 'I am a\r\nmedical man, accustomed to judge of a person's condition by observation.\r\nDo you want me to tell you what is the matter with you?'\r\n\r\nDr. Ephraim Peters paused, as if for a reply.\r\n\r\nA natural instinct, which acts without our volition, took such sudden\r\npossession of Hiram, that he raised his eyes from his papers and turned\r\nthem upon the questioner, as if expecting him to continue.\r\n\r\n'I see the subject interests you,' said the doctor. 'Take my advice. Sit\r\nover your papers less, and exercise more--or you will be struck with\r\nparalysis within five years! Good-day.'\r\n\r\nHe turned and quitted the apartment with a slow and dignified step.\r\n\r\nAs he advanced a little way along the street, he encountered Holmes,\r\nstill in search of a police officer.\r\n\r\nHe had been at two or three places where one was always visible; but,\r\nas usual when wanted, none were to be found.\r\n\r\n'Holmes,' said the doctor, addressing him as if he had known him all his\r\nlife, 'hurry back to your employer; he wants you particularly.'\r\n\r\nHolmes sped off at the word, delighted to be relieved in his search; and\r\nDr. Ephraim Peters went on his way.\r\n\r\nHe was not mistaken as to the effect of the last attack. His chance shot\r\nstruck Hiram amidships. The latter continued gazing on vacancy for a\r\nmoment or two after the doctor had left the room.\r\n\r\n'Paralysis--paralysis!' he muttered. 'That is what killed mother!'\r\n\r\nHiram started up, and walked across the room. He pinched his arms and\r\nhis legs, and both his cheeks. He fancied his left side had less\r\nsensibility than his right.\r\n\r\n\"My brain _is_ overworked, that's a fact. Dr. Joslin has told me so\r\nfrequently. I must ride every morning before breakfast; I ought not to\r\nhave neglected it. Paralysis! how did he come to say paralysis?'--and he\r\ncommenced pinching himself again.\"\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these demonstrations, Holmes entered.\r\n\r\nHiram turned on him angrily. He had forgotten about sending him for a\r\npolice officer.\r\n\r\n'I thought you wanted me,' said the young man, timidly.\r\n\r\n'No, I do not!'\r\n\r\nHolmes retreated.\r\n\r\nHiram Meeker put on his overcoat, took his hat, and, though still early,\r\nprepared to walk all the way to his house.\r\n\r\nOne thing was uppermost in his mind--paralysis!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHiram reached his house in a very pious state of mind.\r\n\r\nHis wife and Belle were both out, and he went immediately to Harriet's\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nShe was delighted to welcome her father so early, and she told him so.\r\n\r\nHiram regarded the attenuated form and pale, thin face of his daughter,\r\nand I hope I am right in saying that he felt a touch of pity when he\r\nreflected on her distressed situation, shut out from the world, and\r\nslowly wasting away.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, he returned her greeting with more than ordinary kindness,\r\nand seated himself by the side of the couch where she was reclining.\r\n\r\n[Had you the power to look into the HEART, even as the\r\nOmniscient regards it, which, think you, would most challenge your pity,\r\nHiram or his daughter?]\r\n\r\n'I fear you are lonely, Harriet, so much of the day by yourself.'\r\n\r\n'Not very lonely, papa. You know I have a good many visits, and Margaret\r\n(the nurse) is invaluable. She reads to me whenever I desire; and she is\r\nso cheerful always, that--'\r\n\r\n'Has your Uncle Frank been here to-day?' interrupted Hiram.\r\n\r\n'No, papa, but he is coming in to-morrow.'\r\n\r\n'What time, think you?'\r\n\r\n'Uncle generally comes about six o'clock. He says he reserves his last\r\nvisit before dinner for me.'\r\n\r\n'Ask him to dine with us. Tell him I want to see him particularly.'\r\n\r\n'Indeed, I will!' said Harriet, joyfully, for she knew there was not\r\nmuch cordiality between them.\r\n\r\nNow Hiram had suddenly conceived the idea of consulting Doctor Frank\r\nabout any latent tendency to paralysis in his constitution, and whether\r\nit was hereditary or not, and so forth, and so forth. Aside from his\r\nhigh reputation as a physician, he knew his brother could naturally\r\njudge better about that than any one else. His mind, had wandered,\r\ntherefore, from his daughter back to himself.\r\n\r\nFortunately, she did not understand the selfish nature of the\r\ninterruption.\r\n\r\n'I wish you would come home as early every day, papa. How little you\r\nare with us!'\r\n\r\n'It is a great self-denial, my child--very great,' responded Hiram; 'but\r\non the rich fall a heavy responsibility--very heavy--and I must bear it.\r\nProvidence has so ordered. We must uphold society. We have to sustain\r\nlaw and order--law and order.'\r\n\r\nHe should have said that it was law and order which sustained _him_.\r\n\r\n[Ah, reader, it is a mighty _moral restraint_ which makes the crowd wait\r\npatiently _outside_.]\r\n\r\nHarriet heaved a deep sigh. She could not deny what her father had so\r\npertinently expressed, yet these high-sounding words made no impression\r\non her.\r\n\r\n'Alas!' she said, mournfully, ' if I were a man, I should never wish to\r\nbe rich.'\r\n\r\nHiram was preparing to make a harsh reply, but, looking at his daughter,\r\nher wan features at that moment were so expressive of every finer\r\nfeeling, that his baser nature was subdued before it.\r\n\r\nHe took her hand kindly, and said, with a smile, 'My dear child, you\r\nknow nothing about these things.'\r\n\r\n'I suppose not, papa; but I have made you smile, and that is worth\r\nsomething.'\r\n\r\nThe interview was not prolonged. Hiram soon felt a restless feeling come\r\nover him. It occurred to him, just then, that he would have time before\r\ndinner to take a look at the locality which he was preparing to occupy\r\nfor his real-estate improvements.\r\n\r\nHe told Harriet so, and repeating his request that she should induce her\r\nuncle to stay to dinner, he left her apartment.\r\n\r\nAs the door closed, his daughter sighed again. For a while she appeared\r\nto be absorbed in thought. Recovering, she directed the nurse to proceed\r\nwith the book she had in reading.\r\n\r\nWe dare not inquire what was passing in her mind during those few\r\nmoments of reflection. Perhaps, through that strange discrimination\r\nwhich is sometimes permitted to those appointed to die, she had a\r\npartial insight into her father's real nature.\r\n\r\nI trust not. I hope she was spared that trial. It is an awful thing for\r\na child to awaken to a sense of a parent's unworthiness!\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nThe two brothers had met--had met more congenially than they ever met\r\nbefore. This was all Hiram's doings. He seemed like a new creature in\r\nhis bearing toward Doctor Frank, who could not (indeed he had no wish to\r\ndo so) resist the influence of his cordial treatment. After dinner, they\r\nsat together in the library. They chatted of the old, old times when\r\nFrank was in college, and Hiram, a little bit of a fellow, was his pet\r\nand plaything during the vacations.\r\n\r\n'We have done something, Frank, to keep up the Meeker name in New York,'\r\nsaid the millionnaire, when that topic was exhausted. 'You are at the\r\ntop of the profession, and I--I have accomplished a good deal.'\r\n\r\nHiram spoke in such a genial, mellow tone, that Frank was touched.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' he replied; '_you_ have at least achieved wonders. Do you\r\nremember what mother used always to prophesy about you? It is fulfilled\r\ntenfold.'\r\n\r\n'Poor mother!' sighed Hiram.\r\n\r\n'Ah, yes! she was carried off very unexpectedly. What a vigorous\r\nconstitution she had, to all appearance!'\r\n\r\n'Do you know, Frank, they tell me I may look for a similar visitation at\r\nher age?'\r\n\r\n'You? nonsense! Who has been filling your ears with such stuff?'\r\n\r\n'Stuff or not, so I am advised seriously. What think you of it?'\r\n\r\nThus appealed to, Doctor Frank regarded his brother more critically.\r\n\r\n'That is right,' said Hiram. 'Now that you are here, give me an\r\nexamination.'\r\n\r\nDoctor Frank thereupon asked several pertinent questions, to which\r\nsatisfactory replies were made. He sounded Hiram's chest: it was\r\nresponsive as a drum. Then he proceeded to manipulate him in a more\r\nprofessional way. He put his ear close down, and held it for a minute,\r\nto get the pulsation of the heart. This he repeated two or three times.\r\n\r\nHiram's face grew anxious.\r\n\r\n'You find something wrong,' he said.\r\n\r\nHis brother made no reply, except to ask more questions.\r\n\r\nAt last he exclaimed, 'You are all right, Hiram--all right. There _is_ a\r\nlittle irregularity about the action of the heart: it is not chronic,\r\nbut connected with the digestive organs. You are in as good health as a\r\nman could ask to be. Only, don't use your brain quite so much; it\r\ninterferes with your digestion, and that in you affects the action of\r\nthe heart. It is not worth mentioning, I assure you' (Hiram was looking\r\nalarmed); 'but, since you can just as well as not, I say, take more\r\nexercise, and give your brain a holiday now and then.'\r\n\r\n'Thank you--thank you! So you don't think there is anything in the idea\r\nthat I shall be--be--struck with paralysis--at about the same age that\r\nmother was?'\r\n\r\n'Pure nonsense, Hiram--utter nonsense!' exclaimed Doctor Frank,\r\ncheerfully. [He knew how foolish it is to alarm one.] 'Still, exercise,\r\nexercise. That we ought all to do.'\r\n\r\nThe next day, Hiram commenced his morning rides; one hour before\r\nbreakfast regularly.\r\n\r\nHe had fought the battle of life, and had won. Now he was called on to\r\ngo into another contest. He set to work at this with his customary\r\nassiduity.\r\n\r\nNo one who saw the millionnaire on his horse, trotting sharply over the\r\nroad very early in the morning, understood really what was going on.\r\n\r\nOne day, however, Dr. Ephraim Peters caught sight of him, spurring on\r\nunder full headway, as if everything depended on the work he had in\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n'Do you know who that is, and what he is about?' asked the young doctor\r\nof his companion.\r\n\r\n'No.'\r\n\r\n'It is Hiram Meeker, _fighting Death_'\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nAs the gay season progressed, the love affair between Signor Filippo\r\nBarbone and the daughter of the millionnaire was not permitted to\r\nlanguish.\r\n\r\nThe Signor was not in society.\r\n\r\nMuch as she might desire to do so, Belle dared not venture on the\r\nhazardous experiment of introducing into her own aristocratic circle one\r\nwho had so lately figured as a second-rate opera singer. He would have\r\nbeen recognized at once, and the whole town agitated by the scandal.\r\n\r\nBelle knew this very well. Yet, strange to say, it did not in the least\r\nweaken her infatuation for this coarse fellow. On the contrary, I think\r\nit stimulated it. Self-willed and imperious, she tolerated with extreme\r\nimpatience any restraint whatever. In this instance, it was the more\r\ntantalizing and exciting, because she felt that the world would be in\r\nopposition to her; while her lover adroitly added fuel to the flame, by\r\nprotesting that he would no longer consent to be so unjust, so selfish,\r\nso criminal, as to attempt to absorb her attention, or even intrude on\r\nher notice. True, he should himself fade away and perish (he looked very\r\nmuch like it); what of that? What were misery and death to him, compared\r\nwith her ease and peace of mind?\r\n\r\nThereupon he would disappear for two or three days, during which time\r\nBelle would work herself into a fever of excitement. And when he did\r\nreturn, unable, as he would say, to keep his oath to himself never to\r\nsee her again, she would receive him with such emotion and such\r\npassionate demonstrations of delight, that the wily knave was satisfied\r\nhe had completed his conquest.\r\n\r\nThings were at just this pass, when Hiram received an anonymous letter,\r\nwarning him in vague terms of what was going on, but mentioning no\r\nnames.\r\n\r\nHiram was thunderstruck. On reflection, he was convinced that it was the\r\nwork of some envious person, who had got up the note to cause him or his\r\ndaughter annoyance; or else that it was a miserable joke, perpetrated by\r\nsome foolish fellow. So entirely was he assured that one or the other\r\nhypothesis was correct, that he dismissed the matter from his mind. He\r\ncarried the note home, however, and handed it to Belle in a playful\r\nmanner, while he bestowed his customary caress, and received a kiss in\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\n'Young lady, what do you think of that?' he asked.\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate--or rather most unfortunate--that Hiram did not\r\nentertain the slightest suspicion of his daughter: else he would have\r\nbeen led to scrutinize her countenance as he made the remark.\r\n\r\nLike most persons who are accustomed to decide for themselves, he never\r\nquestioned the correctness of his judgment after it was once formed.\r\n\r\nBelle, for an instant, felt the floor sinking away under her feet!\r\n\r\nIt was only for an instant.\r\n\r\nWith the readiness for which the sex are so remarkable, she at once gave\r\nway to a most violent exhibition of temper. She walked up and down the\r\nroom, apparently in a transport of rage; she tore the note into a\r\nhundred pieces, and _threw them into the grate_.\r\n\r\nWhat was to be done? What would her father do to punish the miscreant\r\nwho had dared take such a liberty with her name? Boldly she stepped\r\nbefore him, and asked the question.\r\n\r\nDuring these exhibitions, Hiram stood smiling all the while. Belle was\r\nvery handsome, and never, as he thought, so brilliant as at that moment,\r\ngiving vent to her woman's passion.\r\n\r\nIt was really so. Her form, her face, her eyes worked so harmoniously in\r\nthe scene she had got up to cover what was below the surface, that she\r\ndid present, to any one whose senses were arbiters, a most beautiful\r\ndisplay.\r\n\r\n'You are laughing at me, papa--I see very plainly you are laughing at\r\nme! I will not endure it! I--'\r\n\r\n'Belle,' interrupted her father, 'you little goose, what do you think I\r\ncare for the scribbling of any fool that chooses to disgrace himself?\r\nWhat should you, my daughter, care? To be sure, I can understand why you\r\nmay suddenly give way to your feelings; but there is reason in all\r\nthings. Don't you think the miserable fellow who penned that scrawl\r\n(by-the-way, you have very foolishly destroyed it, provided you did wish\r\nto trace it out)--I say, don't you think the fellow who perpetrated the\r\nridiculous joke would be pleased enough to see how you take it?'\r\n\r\nHe took his daughter by the arm--a very beautiful arm--and gave her a\r\nlittle shake--a playful, pleasant shake. Looking her in the face, he\r\nsaid: 'Answer me, Belle--am I not right? Have you not sense enough to\r\nsee that I am right?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I suppose so, papa. You are always right. That is, I never can\r\nanswer your arguments; but--'\r\n\r\n'That will do, Belle. Run off to your room, and come down quite yourself\r\nfor dinner.'\r\n\r\nBelle gave her father an arch smile, to show how obedient she was, and\r\nbounded away.\r\n\r\nHiram watched his daughter with delight as she ran up the staircase, and\r\nhis heart exulted in the possession of a child so charming and\r\nattractive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ANDES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Andes, like a vast wall, extend along the western coast of South\r\nAmerica. Woods cluster, like billows of foliage, around the feet of the\r\nmountains. A vast network of intersecting streams is woven by the\r\ngigantic warp and woof of these mountains. Many brooks, stealing along,\r\nscarcely heard, over the table-lands, and many fierce torrents, dashing\r\nwildly through rocky crevices, fill the great streams that roll, some\r\ninto the Caribbean Sea, some into the near Pacific; while one, the\r\nmighty Amazon, stretches across the continent for more than three\r\nthousand miles, and swells the Atlantic with the torrents of the Andes.\r\nThe keel of a vessel entering the Amazon from the Atlantic, may cut\r\nthrough waters that once fell as flakes of snow on the most western\r\nridges of the Andes, and glistened with the last rays of the sun as he\r\nsank in the Pacific.\r\n\r\nA spell of fascination hangs about the Amazon. Its wonders, known and\r\nunknown, have a marvellous attraction; and the perils encountered in its\r\nexploration give a throb of interest to its very name.\r\n\r\nHow terrible were the sufferings of Gonzalo Pizarro and his companions,\r\nwho set forth in youth and vigor to explore the valley of the Amazon!\r\nHow worn and haggard the survivors returned to Quito, leaving some of\r\nthe daring cavaliers of Spain to bleach in death on the wild plain, or\r\nto moulder in the lonely glen! No river has sadder chronicles of\r\nsuffering and danger than the Amazon. Still, the exploration, so\r\nhazardous, yet of such vast value, will go on. Many a hero in the great\r\nwar with nature will follow the track of Herndon, the noble man as well\r\nas the brave explorer, who escaped the perils of the great river, only\r\nto sink, with his manly heart, into the great deep.\r\n\r\nIn science as in war, ranks after ranks may fall; but the living press\r\non to fill the vacant places. The squadrons are ever full and eager for\r\nservice. To search new lands through and through, or to drag old cities\r\nfrom the graves of centuries, men will advance as heroically as an army\r\nmoves to the capture of Chapultepec. Not a flower can breathe forth its\r\nfragrance, though in marshes full of venomous serpents and of as deadly\r\nmalaria, but science will count its leaves, and copy with unerring\r\npencil the softest tints that stain them with varied bloom and beauty.\r\nScience will detect every kind of rock in the structure of the most\r\ndefiant crag. Not a bird can chant or build its nest in the most leafy\r\nshade, but science will find the nest, describe every change of color on\r\nthe feathers of the little singer, and set to music every tone that\r\ngushes from its tiny throat. Not a gem can repose safe from seizure, in\r\nthe rocks, in the sand, or in the torrent. Not a star can twinkle in the\r\nabyss of night, but science will tell its rate of light, and describe\r\nits silent and mysterious orbit. Torrid heat, the earthquake, the\r\ntornado, the pestilence, mountains of ice, craters of flame--science\r\nwill dare them all, to know one more law of nature. God speed the daring\r\nof science, if only her votaries will not place the law in the place of\r\nHim who made both it and the works which it was commissioned to guide.\r\nScience, when she has found the highest and the most comprehensive law\r\nof nature, has not touched Deity itself; she has but touched the hem of\r\nthe garment of the Great Lawgiver.\r\n\r\nOne veteran of science, Alexander von Humboldt, has yielded to the great\r\nlaw of humanity, as inexorable as any that he found in nature. His\r\nresearches in South America, though mainly confined to the valley of\r\nthe Oronoco, were most thorough, and his array of facts and observations\r\nare of inestimable value. Yet, Humboldt searched into nature with the\r\ncoldness of the anatomist, content with examining its material\r\nstructure, rather than with the zeal of one who seeks images of Divine\r\npower impressed alike on solid rocks and gliding streams. Science,\r\nhowever rigid, would not have restrained the ardor of homage to the\r\nAuthor of creative energy and grandeur, bursting forth irrepressibly in\r\nscenes where angels would have adored the Great First Cause, and where\r\nman can do no less.\r\n\r\nHumboldt's fame as an observer is founded on a rock which no mortal\r\npower can shake. He lacked the reverential insight into the higher and\r\ndeeper powers of nature, but, so far as his mental eyes saw, he\r\ndescribed surely and vividly the manifestations of those powers. He was\r\nan observer of wonderful skill in the outer courts of nature, though he\r\nseemed either not to seek or to be bewildered in seeking her interior\r\nshrine. He exemplified rather the talent than the genius of discovery,\r\nthe patient sagacity which accumulates materials, rather than the fervid\r\nenthusiasm which traces the stream of nature's action to its spring, the\r\ngreat Creative Will. Yet, the very title of Humboldt's great work, the\r\nconcentrated fruit of a life of toil, 'Cosmos,' meaning beauty and\r\norder, and, then, the visible world, as illustrating both, seems to show\r\na gleam of feeling above the spirit of material research. His warmest\r\nadmirer could have respecting him no worthier hope than that he, who has\r\nleft the scene of earthly beauty which he so long and diligently\r\nstudied, may have had the joy to discern, in the sphere of celestial\r\norder, the Cosmos of the skies, higher and deeper truths than external\r\nnature can teach.\r\n\r\nAn American artist, Church, has portrayed with great force and beauty\r\nsome portions of the inspiring scenery of the Andes. Church's pictures\r\nare avowedly compositions, and not transcripts of actual views; yet,\r\nthey are not more remarkable for ideal beauty than for truthfulness to\r\nnature. Although no real scenes among the Andes correspond to his\r\npainting, yet the glorious characteristics of the Andes are seen in\r\nevery line, in every color, in all the strange lights and shadows of his\r\npaintings. Imagination, which sees at once the powers and proportions of\r\nthings, is, when joined to a feeling heart, the surest guide to him who\r\nwould describe natural truth, whether of the souls of men or of material\r\nforms. The realists of art may not be so well satisfied with a\r\ncomposition, as with the delineation, line by line, and point by point,\r\nof a scene in nature; yet the more comprehensive critic will own that\r\nuniversality will gain by the composition far more than local identity\r\ncan lose. By his imaginative skill, Church has portrayed in two or three\r\npictures those characteristics of scenery which, to be faithfully\r\ndelineated in copies from actual views, would require a hundred\r\npaintings. This is alike his best defence and his highest praise.\r\n\r\nIn recalling my own observations among these noble mountains, and in\r\nstriving to express them in language, I feel how much higher is the\r\nvantage ground of the painter. One may examine for hours the canvas,\r\nuntil every scene is fixed on the memory as on the canvas itself. Yet I\r\nwill endeavor to give a general view of the scenery of the stupendous\r\nAndes--stupendous truly, yet among those mountains are scenes of such\r\nquiet beauty as to touch the heart as tenderly as softest music.\r\n\r\nScarcely a hundred miles from the Pacific Ocean arise some of the\r\nhighest peaks of the Andes, yet the way upward is much longer. From the\r\ncoast, or from the decks of ships sailing by it, may be seen, in clear\r\nweather, some of the peaks of the mountains. On the shores, hazes and\r\nmists often temper the tropical sun and obscure distant objects; but,\r\nat early morning and evening, sometimes the great snowy dome of\r\nChimborazo may be seen afar, towering in majesty above the tropical\r\nverdure between its base and the ocean. It looks as if invading the\r\nheavens with its colossal form; and at such times it wears a vesture of\r\nglory. A few years ago, in New England, of a clear night in the depth of\r\nwinter, an aurora of the north reddened the whole sky; and the earth\r\nbeneath, covered with snow, was as red as the sky above. Imagine such an\r\naurora to fall upon the snowy summit of a mountain four miles high, and\r\nyou may conceive how attractive is the flush of beauty upon the brow of\r\nChimborazo at sunrise and at sunset.\r\n\r\nTurn from the broad Pacific, as its long waves glance in the sun; and,\r\nas the morning tide washes up the tropical rivers, go with it along one\r\nof them, a part of the way, perhaps, in a sailing vessel or a steamer,\r\nbut the rest in a light canoe. Tropical shrubbery and forests line the\r\nbanks of the stream. New forms and modes of life impress the traveller\r\nfrom the temperate zone. The scenery of the tropics, so long the wonder\r\nof the imagination, now expands in wild luxuriance before the sight.\r\nWhen you have gone as far as you can along the winding river, waiting,\r\nperhaps, for hours, here and there upon the bank, in some rude cabin, or\r\nunder the shade of some broad fragrant tree, for the returning tide from\r\nthe ocean to bear you swiftly on; disembark upon a strange soil, and\r\nprepare to pursue your journey by mules or horses.\r\n\r\nYou reach the forests, and pierce their dark recesses by narrow paths,\r\nmere winding threads of road. Great clouds of foliage press around you,\r\nand, at the slightest breeze, thrill with that murmur of myriads of\r\ntrees, which is so full of mystery and awe; for there, the very forests,\r\nunbroken and unbounded, seem audibly to breathe together with mystical\r\naccord, and to blend low quivering tones with the grand chorus which\r\nswells daily upward from vales and mountains, seas and shores.\r\n\r\nInterspersed with the thick foliage, on every hand are blossoms and\r\nfruits of every tropical kind. Pale, white bridal blossoms clothe the\r\norange tree, or golden fruit hangs among its clusters of glossy leaves.\r\nThe starry rind and pale-green crown of the pineapple tempt you to enjoy\r\nthe luscious fruit. High in air the cocoanut tree lifts its palmy\r\ndiadem. The long broad leaves of the plantain protect its branches of\r\ngreen or yellow fruit, and throw a grateful shade upon the way, open\r\nhere and there. Here is, indeed \"a wilderness of sweets,\" and the air is\r\nfull of blended fragrances. While the eye ranges, seeing trees, fruits,\r\nand flowers innumerable, of glorious hues and countless kinds, most\r\nnever seen by you before, or at least only as exotics, the ear also\r\ntakes in varied sounds. Birds are singing, insects humming; every tree\r\nseems a choir, and the immeasurable forest a wide congregation of joyful\r\nvoices.\r\n\r\nYou are now on the lowest stage of that sublime gradation of climates\r\nand scenery displayed by the Andes. You cross it in two or three days'\r\njourney (for, as in the East, so, in the mountainous regions of South\r\nAmerica, travelling is measured less by miles than by days' journeys).\r\nYou then arrive at the foot of one of the mountains. Stop and look up! A\r\nridge covered with forests to its very top stands steep before you. The\r\nwind makes tremulous the masses of evergreen foliage, which are now\r\nshaded by the reluctant mists of the morning, slowly ascending, and now\r\nare bright with the full splendor of noon. Above that ridge rises\r\nanother, and another yet, unseen at the foot. Begin the ascent. The\r\nmules tremble as they strive to keep their hold on the steep, slippery\r\nsoil. Press upward in zigzag paths for hours. Reach the top of the\r\nridge, and descend into the valley between it and another higher\r\nopposite; then, ascend again. As you thus slowly, patiently, yet surely\r\nreach the heart of the mountainous region, wild diversity of views holds\r\nyou bound in wonder and strange delight. Here are level places--here\r\npure, bright brooks glide on as smoothly as in meadows. There, a torrent\r\nrushes over crags, foaming and roaring in an everlasting cascade. Before\r\nyou may be a hillside, green with luxuriant pasturage, where flocks and\r\nherds graze quietly through the day, while the shepherd, with his crook\r\nand harmonic pipe, reminds you of classic scenes. Turn aside--and you\r\nmay look down into cavernous recesses, whose gloomy, depths you cannot\r\nmeasure. Scenes fair and fearful meet in the same horizon. So, in life,\r\nthe gentle charities, that, like the face of Una, make sunshine in the\r\nshady place, are often found not far from rugged rage and black despair.\r\nPress on through glad and sombre scenery. Press upward in steep ways,\r\nmiry and craggy, narrow and broad, by turns.\r\n\r\nNow, so deep are the paths cut in the mountain, so high are the banks,\r\nso contracted is the way, that, the higher you rise, the less you appear\r\nto see; and you feel disappointed at missing the grand horizon of\r\nsmaller mountains, on which, coming nearer the summit, you expected to\r\nlook; but now, a shout of exultation breaks from your lips; and well it\r\nmay. A new Pacific Ocean seems to expand before you, as if by some\r\nsudden enchantment. It is an ocean of constant verdure and inexhaustible\r\nfertility, spreading far, far below you, as far as you can see, on every\r\nside but that from which, high on the mountain top, you look down upon\r\nthe view. The seeming ocean is the first table land, whose soft, green\r\nundulations fill the horizon, though, when the sky is clear, the snowy\r\nmountains may be seen far away, dazzling the heavens and the earth with\r\ntheir brightness. Spring and autumn here join hands, consecrating the\r\ndouble seedtime and the double harvest of the year. Yonder is a field of\r\nripened grain. And there is the Indian laborer, near his cabin of thatch\r\nand clay, guiding the rude ploughshare through the fertile soil.\r\n\r\nDescend the mountain, and, crossing that sea of beauty, ascend the\r\nmountains beyond. The scenes, just now all soft and pleasing, give way\r\nto others which unite the lovely and the severe. Look upward. There\r\nrises a mountain, so gently curving and so green, so alluring with its\r\nlight and shade, that it seems the very emblem of graceful majesty,\r\nlooking as if it must know its wondrous beauty, and as calm as if no\r\nwind strong enough to make a violet tremble could ever breathe upon its\r\nface; yet near, in vivid contrast, stands a craggy peak, towering up,\r\nup, toward the deep blue sky, so broken and so black that it seems like\r\nthe very Giant Despair of mountains, frowning with unearthly fierceness\r\nupon his gentle neighbor, who returns his grim looks with meek and\r\nplacid trust. Where whirlwinds and tempests await the signal for howling\r\ndesolation, stands the beautiful colossal image of sublime serenity.\r\n\r\nAgain, steep, rocky roads lead over rugged cliffs. Your horses climb\r\npanting, and descend, picking their steps, upon the other side. Stop\r\nawhile on this green space, a valley between two high ridges. Countless\r\nflowers spread fragrance and beauty around. They are not those alone of\r\nthe strictly tropical level, but, owing to the height above the sea, the\r\nfloral wealth of the temperate zone is embosomed in the torrid region\r\nitself, and adds the charm of an almost magical diversity to the\r\nintrinsic splendors of the scene. See small objects flitting about from\r\nflower to flower. They are the smallest and most delicate of\r\nhummingbirds, nowhere found but in America. Watch their colors, changing\r\nwith every changing motion, purple, crimson, golden, green. It is as if\r\nthe very flowers had taken life, and were revelling with conscious glee\r\nin the soft, bright air. The hues of these birds are dazzlingly bright.\r\nThe little creatures glance about like prismatic rays embodied in the\r\nsmallest visible forms.\r\n\r\nAfter gazing upon these hummingbirds with joy as great as theirs, as\r\nthey revel like fairies in the profusion of this flowery valley, look\r\nupward on the high, grand ridges that close it in. What suddenly starts\r\nfrom the very top of yon cliff, and floats in the air, high, high, above\r\nyou? It is the great condor, expanding his broad wings, wheeling in\r\nflight from ridge to ridge, curving with majestic motion, now poising\r\nhimself upon his wings, now apparently descending, now suddenly but\r\ngracefully turning upward, until his lessening shape has gone beyond the\r\nfarthest reach of sight. The hummingbird and the condor; hillsides\r\ncovered with sheep; rocky ridges inaccessible to man or beast; brooks\r\nthat quiver gently on; impetuous torrents; the beauty of Eden and craggy\r\ndesolation like that of chaos--these all can you see among the Andes.\r\n\r\nLet not the fascination of this valley, the songs of birds, the flowers,\r\nthe hummingbirds glistening among them like gems, the soft outlines of\r\nthe scenery detain you long. Harder and sterner scenes await you. The\r\nAndes are a picture of life. Every cliff records a lesson; and the\r\nunnumbered flowers interweave with their varied dyes and rich perfumes\r\ngentle suggestions, sweet similitudes for the understanding and the\r\nheart. If, as in this charming valley, the senses may be dissolved in\r\njoy, and the spirit would linger willingly in rapt delight, soon some\r\nhard experience, kindly sent, requires one to brace all manly energy for\r\nthe rough encounter, the blast of peril, and duty's steep and craggy\r\nroad. You ascend in narrowing ways, casting long, lingering looks upon\r\nthe valley, whenever it opens to view between the cliffs.\r\n\r\nHere, the ridges are so near together that the shrubbery from the top of\r\neach joins in an arch overhead. There, you pass along by the side of a\r\nmountain, in a path which affords scarcely room for a single horseman,\r\nand where he who enters the close defile, shouts aloud, and, if the\r\nfirst, thus gains a right of way through, and parties on the other side,\r\nhearing the shout, must wait their turn. Now, you leave for a while the\r\nnarrow road, and descend upon a beautiful table land, bounded on the\r\nsides by parallel but distant mountains; and the open places reveal\r\nfertile plains in far perspective. Light streams through the wide, clear\r\nspace in a golden tide of splendor. Again, you are partly surrounded by\r\nan amphitheatre of hills, rising in gradations, and of such impressive\r\nmagnitude and extent that one might imagine that here the secret forces\r\nof nature are wont to take bodily shape, to look on the grand tragic\r\nstorms which their own fearful agency has raised.\r\n\r\nNow, on one side, the mountains subside into soft undulations; on the\r\nother, the ridges are colossal, dark, and broken, and along the edges of\r\ntheir successive summits is a line of snow, varying with the line of the\r\ncliffs, and glittering like burnished silver in the sun, above the\r\njagged battlements. The deep blue sky, the shining snow, the huge, dark,\r\nrocky bases, the different shades of color harmoniously blending, the\r\nsoft and rugged shapes contrasting vividly--well may impress the soul\r\nwith pleasure-relieving awe, with awe-ennobling pleasure.\r\n\r\nDismount awhile for rest. Enter this rude, thatched house by the\r\nwayside, on a level spot. Laden mules pass by in crowds, attended by\r\nIndian drivers, each of whom doffs his hat and blesses you--a mere\r\nceremony, it may be, but one in picturesque keeping with the scenery.\r\nInvigorated by the breeze, the shade, the rest, prepare to go higher,\r\nhigher, higher yet. First, pluck some of these roses that grow profusely\r\naround you, that, if you reach the line of snow that never melts, you\r\nmay place upon the cold bosom of perpetual winter these blushing symbols\r\nof perpetual spring.\r\n\r\nAgain, you reach the edge of a cliff, through the deep, narrow valley\r\nbetween which and the cliff opposite pours a furious torrent, which,\r\nresounding louder and louder as it is approached, now drowns all other\r\nsounds in its despotic roar. But, fearful as it looks, it must be\r\ncrossed. Some of these torrents are spanned by bridges; but most of them\r\nare so impetuous, especially in the rainy season, that bridges even of\r\nstone would be undermined, and those of timber would be swept away like\r\nwisps of straw. You must now trust to the sagacity of your mules or\r\nhorses. You descend the precipitous side of the cliff, seeming to\r\nyourself as if about to fall headlong into the torrent; but after a\r\npainful and perilous jaunt, you reach its level. Its roar now confuses\r\nand nearly stuns you. Each side is more or less precipitous, and you\r\nseem at the mercy of the furious tide, while jutting rocks above seem\r\njust ready to be loosened by some convulsion, and to crush you with\r\ntheir merciless weight: meantime, your horse stands unmoved by the peril\r\nbefore or above him, apparently deaf to the noise of the torrent, and\r\nquietly surveys the rapids, as if to select the safest point to cross.\r\nDisturb him not. He takes his time, and places one foot and then another\r\nin the torrent. As he reaches the main current, he trembles, not with\r\nfear, but with the effort to keep himself from being swept against the\r\nrocks. He may be able to keep his footing and to walk across, though\r\npanting and shaking at every step; or the stream may be so deep that he\r\nis forced to swim. If so, he bears up _manfully_ (if one may say so)\r\nagainst the rushing force, and at last scrambles up the least steep peak\r\nof the opposite bank, bearing you more dizzy than he is. But the bank\r\nitself is only the foot of a ridge as precipitous as that which you\r\ndescended to reach the stream. Quietly, patiently, surely the horse\r\nascends. A sudden misstep or unwary slip among the loose stones of the\r\npath would send you far backward into the torrent which you have just\r\nescaped. This very seldom happens, for the horses and mules have been\r\nwell trained for the service. In all the perils, the horse or mule is a\r\nsafer guide than you. Give him a free rein, and he will bear you up the\r\nhardest, roughest, steepest places.\r\n\r\nYou are now high among the Andes, far above every sign of tropical\r\nvegetation; and, although hourly you are approaching the equatorial\r\nline, yet hourly also it is growing colder. Look up! A snowy peak rises\r\ndirectly before you, and seems to challenge you with its refulgent,\r\ninaccessible majesty. The sight at first almost appals, but fascinates.\r\nThe feeling of fear soon surrenders to absorbing enjoyment of the\r\nsublimity of the scene. The more you look, the more you desire to look.\r\nThere stands the mountain, a single glance at which repays all the\r\nfatigue and danger of the road;--there it stands, as high above the\r\nPacific Ocean as if Vesuvius should be piled upon itself again, and\r\nagain, and yet again. Clear snow covers it with a robe of dazzling\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nThe snowy peak, though it seems so near in the pure atmosphere, is a\r\nweary distance off. As you advance slowly and laboriously upward, the\r\nwind blows almost like a hurricane. You can hardly breast its force. It\r\ngrows colder and colder. Here, on the equator, man may freeze to death.\r\nBear a stout heart and a firm face against the cold and the wind.\r\n\r\nNow it is too steep even for the horses and mules of the Andes. You are\r\nascending toward the snowy peak whose alluring brightness has charmed\r\nthe long way, since you saw it first. Dismount and climb as you can\r\namong the rocks. The glittering snow is near. You pant as if you might\r\nsoon lose all power to breathe again; yet, press on, and now touch at\r\nlast the pure, bright, equatorial snow.\r\n\r\nWould you now reach the very summit which shines far, far above you,\r\narrayed in glowing white. That you cannot do. Angels descending on\r\nministries of grace may touch that snowy mountain top, but mortal feet\r\nit never felt. That radiant peak is sacred from bold endeavor and the\r\nassaults of battle. War's gory feet never climbed so far. War's flaming\r\ntorch never stained that pure and snowy light. Swords never flashed\r\namong those white defiles. Angels of peace guard the tops of the Andes.\r\nThere is truce to all the rage of earth. During the middle ages, an\r\ninterval in every week was sacred from the assaults of foes. It was\r\ncalled the Truce of God. Not for three days, but for countless ages,\r\nfrom the birth of time to the final consummation, on these snowy summits\r\nof the Andes shines in pure white the Holy Truce of God.\r\n\r\nIn Italy and Sicily, an ethereal veil, a pale, blue gossamer, spreads\r\nover the scenery, as if each object had caught some delicate reflection\r\nfrom the blue heavens above; and the golden illumination of this misty\r\nveil causes the peculiar charm of Italian sunsets. This effect is\r\ngenerally wanting in the scenery of the Andes near the equator, though\r\namong the mountains more remote, a similar effect is sometimes seen.\r\nAmong the Andes of the equatorial region, so pure is the air, that the\r\nfarthest objects visible are exactly defined. The curves and angles of\r\ndistant cliffs are as clearly seen as those of masses of rock at one's\r\nside. Hardly a ray of light is so refracted as to disturb the perfect\r\nshape and color of any object in the horizon. The splendor of the sun\r\nbrings out the true colors of everything within the range of sight; and\r\nso various are these colors, and so diversified are the groupings of\r\nridges and valleys, in the scenery of the Andes of the equator, that the\r\npure developing and defining light and the clear air of that region\r\nproduce effects as enchanting as the transforming light and the soft\r\nveiling air of Italy. At sunrise and at sunset, indeed, but especially\r\nat sunset, a rosy light tinges the snowy summits of the far-off\r\nmountains, but those near shine with pure white, like mountains of\r\nsilver. The hue of every precious stone is found in the colors of the\r\nAndes. Even the crevices on the rocky sides of the mountains without\r\nverdure seem when the sun shines upon them to be filled and overflowing\r\nwith warm hues, varying from the softest lilac to the deep, rich,\r\npervading purple which the artist loves to revel in. Each of the Andes,\r\nbesides his emerald or pearly crown, seems also to wear, like the high\r\npriest of old, a jewelled breastplate, reflecting on earth the glory of\r\nthe skies.\r\n\r\nThe table lands of the Andes, especially when seen from above, resemble\r\nthe rolling prairies of western North America. Both have the same\r\nbeautiful and various undulations, though those of the table lands are\r\nbolder. The prairies are far more extensive; though, often, the table\r\nlands present as broad a horizon of gently curving land. These table\r\nlands in some places extend like vast halls between widely separate but\r\nparallel chains of the Andes--again, like broad corridors along a line\r\nof ridges--again, like wide landings to gigantic stairs, of which the\r\nstone steps are mountains--again, they expand in hollows surrounded by\r\nhills, like lakes of land. Here is one large enough for several small\r\nfarms only--there, many towns and rural estates are found on the same\r\ntable land. Here is one which you may traverse in an hour--there is one\r\nwhich may be several days' journey across.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural wealth of the Andes is mainly concentrated in these\r\ntable lands, in these millions of rolling acres. The table lands are\r\nabove the region of forests. About the watercourses, on the farms, and\r\nin the towns, a few trees may be found--sometimes avenues of them laid\r\nout with care and beauty; and the fruit trees of the temperate zone may\r\nhere be cultivated; but the great forests of the tropical level and the\r\npines of the mountains are absent.\r\n\r\nThe _Paramos_ are sandy plains, in fact, mountain deserts, in the dry\r\nseason liable to great droughts, and in the wet season to fearful\r\nsnowstorms. The armies of Independence, during the wars between Spain\r\nand South America, suffered terrible hardships and exposures in the\r\n_Paramos_. The _Pampas_ are wide and level plains, not so high as the\r\ntable lands, where graze innumerable herds of wild cattle. They are\r\nbeyond the ranges of mountains, in the more central parts of South\r\nAmerica. There are none west of the Andes.\r\n\r\nThe table lands complete the sublime varieties of the scenery. Their\r\nserenity enchants, as the grandeur of the mountains that rise above them\r\nexalts the mind. The works of nature are not only adapted to human need\r\nwith Omniscient skill, as these fertile lands among the sterner\r\nmountains prove; but, feelings different, yet harmonious, are excited by\r\nthe combinations of Infinite Power. The emotion of awe, being one of\r\ngreat concentration, becomes even painful, if the tension of the mind be\r\ntoo long sustained; and so He who tempers the ineffable splendor of His\r\nimmediate presence even to the gaze of angels, with the rainbow of\r\nemerald about his throne, with the sea of crystal, the tree of life, or\r\nthe gates of precious stones, also soothes the sublimity of mountains\r\nwith gentle traits of scenery and soft gradations of color which give\r\nenjoyment more passive than awe, and rather captivate than overpower the\r\neye and soul.\r\n\r\nFrom the table lands can often be seen in the distance snow-covered tops\r\nof mountains, projected in bold, white outlines against the deep-blue\r\nsky; and there the sky is really blue, not of that pale tinge that often\r\npasses for it, but of a deeper blue than even the rich October sky of\r\nNorth America. As if joining the sky, are the shining summits of the\r\nmountains. The two ethereal colors, blue and white, thus meet in\r\ndazzling harmony. Sometimes so many of these white, towering heights can\r\nbe seen, and in so different quarters, that one may almost fancy the sky\r\nitself to be a vast dome of sapphire supported by gigantic pillars of\r\nmarble.\r\n\r\nMost of the cities, villages, and farms are on these table lands. Often,\r\nfor the sake of the grand view, a villa is built on a steep ridge,\r\nwithin sight of the broad, undulating surface of some plateau; or, in\r\nsome position of peerless beauty, the glittering cross on some convent\r\nmay be seen. The Spanish race appreciate the picturesque, as is shown by\r\ntheir choice of sites, not only in Spain, but in Spanish America. The\r\npoetical, imaginative character which has marked Spanish annals for\r\ncenturies, still marks those who have any claim to Spanish descent. The\r\nSouth American, though half an Indian, recognizes the grandeur of his\r\nnative mountains, and the beauty of the broad, fertile valleys, while a\r\nthorough-going Anglo-Saxon of North America, in the same places, would\r\ncalculate whether or not the torrent that rushes foaming and glittering\r\ndown the mountain is too steep to serve a mill, or whether the smaller\r\nmountains might not be levelled for building lots; or he would gaze upon\r\nsome beautiful table land with wonder indeed, but with wonder chiefly\r\nhow much wheat or barley there grows to the acre, or can be made to\r\ngrow. The table lands produce the grains and fruits of the temperate\r\nzone; and, accordingly, proprietors who own, as many do, estates on the\r\ntropical and on the temperate level, may supply their tables with fruits\r\nfrom their own grounds, for which, in other countries, the world must be\r\nbrought under contribution. The soil is cultivated mainly by Indians.\r\nDescendants of the ancient rulers of the land now till the fields of the\r\ndescendants of the conquerors.\r\n\r\nSome, indeed, representing more or less the Indian part of the\r\npopulation, are owners of estates; yet a full Indian rarely has lands of\r\nhis own. He is a hewer of wood and a drawer of water, tills the fields,\r\nand performs most of the drudgery of the country. More South Americana\r\nof Indian descent, out of the general population, have gained honor and\r\npower than could possibly have done so under the confined and absolute\r\nsway of the Incas. The Indians of all Spanish America have progressed,\r\nhowever slowly and rudely, in the arts, labors, culture, and faith of\r\nChristian civilization, and, in the aggregate, are in advance of the\r\nIndians of Anglo-America.\r\n\r\nLet the imagination survey the whole range of the Andes for their vast\r\nextent of sixty degrees of latitude. On every level space are seen the\r\nsigns of culture and human habitation, fields green with the early\r\ngrain, or yellow with the harvest. The roads now wind through forests of\r\nconstant shade, even under the burning sun of the equator; now they turn\r\nwith gentle windings, or with steep abruptness, while below spread\r\nbright and beautiful lands, and interesting the more because associated\r\nwith the homes and lives of men.\r\n\r\nIn the grandest scenery, some sign of man's abode will be grateful. No\r\none, indeed, whose soul has not been warped out of all likeness to the\r\nDivine image which it once wore, can regard without abhorrence such\r\nintrusions of noisy machinery into scenes of natural sublimity as,\r\nfor instance, have desecrated the neighborhood of Niagara Falls,\r\nand which would have done so yet more, but for the energetic and\r\nforever-praiseworthy resistance of the proprietors of adjacent grounds;\r\nas if America, with her thousands of miles of rivers, and almost\r\ninfinite number of rapid, unfailing brooks, had not mill privileges\r\nenough, without daring to insult the Divine Majesty by wresting the\r\nFalls of Niagara from their true design. The spirit of gain, which has\r\nbeen eager, though--thanks be to God--it has not been able to spoil the\r\nnatural glory of Niagara, is vile, degraded, base enough to sell a\r\nmother's dying gift for gold, or to seize, if it had the power, the\r\njewelled gates of the New Jerusalem as collateral security for its\r\nmeagre faith in anything divine.\r\n\r\nBut, though the presence of that sacrilegious materialism, of that\r\npractical blasphemy, which defies creative Deity at the very shrines\r\nwhere its infinite power is most wonderfully displayed, is a plague\r\nspot, a malignant sign of spiritual leprosy, which warns all to beware\r\nof its vile contagion; yet, the suggestions of rural toil, the sight of\r\ntilled fields, the cottage, the shepherd and his flock, are all\r\nharmonious with nature, even in her grandeur; for they show that the\r\nglorious wonders of earth were given, not, indeed, to be distorted, but\r\nto be enjoyed by man; and even the stupendous mountain derives a new\r\ncharm from the reflection that it may minister daily to the elevation of\r\nthe soul, while the benign fertility of the valley sustains the natural\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nHow pleasantly these villages nestle upon the breasts of the mountains,\r\nas if there to find shelter from the stormy blast! Trains of mules,\r\nattended by their drivers, whose shrill shouts echo among the rocky\r\nhills, wind upward, laden with rich tropical fruits from the coast, or\r\nwith goods from other lands. Other trains descend, laden with grain and\r\nthe fruits of the temperate zone, from the higher districts.\r\nWell-guarded mules bear bars of precious silver from the mountain mines\r\nfor the currency of the world, or to render dazzling service on the\r\ntables of nobles and kings in foreign lands. Look upon the gorgeous\r\nclouds above you, as if the snowy Andes were soaring heavenward; reach\r\nhigher points, and look upon shining clouds far below, as if the same\r\nsnowy mountains had descended to bow in meek devotion. The llama, the\r\ndelicate beast of burden, sometimes called the Peruvian camel, with\r\ngently curving neck, moves gracefully on, turning often and quickly,\r\nfrom side to side, mild, plaintive eyes, as if entreating pity.\r\n\r\nThe cascade glances like a streak of silver from the mountain at your\r\nside; in the valley you see the sweet, calm lake, or you hear the\r\ntorrent, sounding among shadowy woodlands, never weary, never still.\r\nStand on a lofty ridge, and look abroad on the vast, snowy heights that\r\nappear in the horizon;--then let the 'mind's eye' look beyond the\r\nhorizon, and behold similar peaks stretching three thousand miles along.\r\nThen bend reverently before Him who has made earth so grand.\r\n\r\nGo to the galleries of Rome and Florence. It is wise to gather new\r\nbeauty to the soul from works of art, and to study the exquisite graces\r\nwhich the great masters have gathered from nature and delineated in\r\nglowing canvas or in lasting marble; yet, here is a gallery of paintings\r\nby the Great Master and Author of all sublimity and beauty in heaven and\r\nearth, extending, not from room to room of buildings made with hands and\r\nroofed with cedar, but from hall to hall of nature's colossal cathedral,\r\nroofed by the infinite sky. Look at these pictures, ever changing, yet\r\never grand, of majestic mountains, of reposing valleys, of fertile\r\nplains, of rural homes, of streams and waterfalls, of vast forests, of\r\nmyriad forms of life and beauty, of sunrise, sunset, and the glittering\r\nmoon. What a marvellous variety in the objects portrayed! What surprises\r\nat every turn! Colors more brilliant than Titian or Allston could\r\ncombine, join in harmonious effect on every side, and grace and vigor,\r\nbeauty and grandeur, are blended in every scene and almost in every\r\noutline. Would you examine the famous statues of the world, and admire\r\nthe symmetry of form and power of expression drawn forth by human skill\r\nfrom the hard, white stone? Or will the fragments of ancient art give\r\ndelight for their expressive beauty, visible though in broken forms?\r\nBehold here a gallery of statuary, a line of divine masterpieces, whiter\r\nthan Parian marble, wrought by the 'ANCIENT OF DAYS.' Will you\r\nadmire Michael Angelo's colossal 'Day and Night'? and revere the mortal\r\ngenius that can so impress the soul? Give homage, then, for the majesty\r\nof power with which He who created and adorned the universe has\r\ndisplayed, among the Andes, Day and Night--Day robed with unutterable\r\nsplendor, Night with transcendent awe.\r\n\r\nMountains!--the grandest of nature's visible works--ye are also the\r\nfigures of majesty, of strength, of loftiness of soul! Ye are the raised\r\nletters which record on the great globe the history of man! Ye are the\r\nmighty scales in which the fate of nations has been weighed! Ye have\r\nchecked the march of conquest, or inspired with new, defiant energy the\r\nconqueror's will! Your ranges are the projecting lines which mark, on\r\nthe great dialplate of the world, the shadows of the rolling ages! On\r\nyour steep, bleak heights empires have been lost and won! Ye show how\r\nweak is man, how great is God!\r\n\r\nYe are the home of meditation, the colossal pillars of the audience\r\nchamber of the Deity! The Mount of Contemplation rises far above the\r\nmists of partial opinion and the mire of conflict, the discords of\r\njangling interests and the refractions of divided policies, girt by a\r\nserene and sublime horizon, and within hearing of Nature's everlasting\r\nsong.\r\n\r\nBehold the holy family of mountains, on which the angels look with\r\nreverential wonder: the Mount of Awe, black with clouds and vivid with\r\nlightnings, whence descended the guide of wandering Israel, with light\r\ndivine reflected on his brow; the Mount of Transfiguration, where native\r\nDeity gleamed from the face of the benign Messiah on adoring, rapt\r\ndisciples; the Mount of Sorrow, where the world's grief was borne, and\r\nwhich celestial grace has made the Mount of Joy to 'numbers without\r\nnumber;'--the Mount of Ascension, where last stood on earth Incarnate\r\nMercy. Look up! look up! See how the angelic guards point with\r\namaranthine wands afar, where glows, beyond the vale of tears, the\r\nMountain of Immortal Life.\r\n\r\nBehold, in exalted vision, the mountains of Asia and of the islands of\r\nthe Eastern seas, of Africa, of Europe, of America;--see how they are\r\nbaptized with fire, one after, another, as the sun rises, to spread\r\naround the world the light of its daily consecration. How sadly is the\r\nworld's morning glory soiled and dimmed by thoughtless man ere comes\r\nagain the dark and silent night!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNATIONAL FRIENDSHIPS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot long after the outbreak of the present war, the loyal portion of the\r\ncountry discovered that the sympathies of the British Government, and,\r\nin a great measure, of the British nation, were with the revolted\r\nStates. The expectations of those who looked toward England for at least\r\na hearty moral support, were quickly destroyed by the ill-concealed\r\nspirit of exultation which she exhibited on more than one occasion.\r\nAlthough it can hardly be asserted that the great body of our people\r\nexpected from her more than an impartial observance of strict\r\nneutrality, it nevertheless occasioned considerable surprise that a\r\ncountry, called so often as herself to the task of surpressing\r\nrebellions, should be prejudiced against ourselves when similarly\r\nsituated.\r\n\r\nWith France, however, it was different. We had for years been accustomed\r\nto regard the French as our natural allies. The amicable relations which\r\nhad existed between us, with but comparatively little interruption,\r\nsince the days of the Revolution, naturally led us to look to them for a\r\ndegree of sympathy not to be expected from our constant rivals and\r\ncompetitors the English. It was with painful surprise therefore that we\r\nshortly perceived that the French Government was, of all others, the\r\nmost hostile to our cause, and the one to be regarded with the most\r\nsuspicion and distrust.\r\n\r\nSpain also took advantage of our weakened condition to display a spirit\r\nof enmity toward us no less decided than that observed on the part of\r\nher more powerful neighbors. In short, of the whole great family of\r\nEuropean nations scarcely one expressed a friendly interest for us in\r\nour perilous position.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising, then, that, surrounded as we were by traitors at\r\nhome, we manifested an almost unmanly regret on finding ourselves\r\ndeserted by those whom we were wont to consider as friends abroad; and\r\nwhen we now reflect upon the bearing of those nations toward us, the\r\ninquiry naturally arises, whether there really exists no such thing as\r\ntrue friendship between nations. It is a mournful question; and not a\r\nfew, unwilling to believe that such is the case, will at once point to\r\nfrequent close alliances, to more than one example of the generous\r\nbehavior of one people toward another. But our own experience has taught\r\nus that friendship exists between nations only so far as it is warranted\r\nby interest, and that all the instances referred to as proving the\r\ncontrary, have been owing to the personal influence of high-minded men,\r\nwho, at the time, were in power; and even in such cases a far-sighted\r\npolicy will frequently prove to have been the ruling motive which\r\nprompted their apparently disinterested measures.\r\n\r\nAnd here we pause to consider what considerations of interest could have\r\nstirred up such hostility to our prosperity, and caused such\r\ngratification when our very existence was threatened. In what way would\r\nour destruction benefit England? The advantages which she derives from\r\nher commercial intercourse with us are far greater than any which would\r\naccrue to her if she ruled the broken fragments of our country as she\r\nrules the oppressed provinces of India or her distant possessions in\r\nAustralia. The same may be substantially said with regard to France. How\r\nfar from compensated would she be for the loss of such large consumers\r\nof her staple productions as ourselves by the acquisition of portions of\r\nterritory here, which would in all likelihood prove as unprofitable as\r\nher African dominions?\r\n\r\nSpain, too, although her shadow of an excuse for her apparent ill will\r\ntoward us may be a little darker than that of Great Britain or France,\r\nsince she doubtless hopes that by the destruction of our power and\r\ninfluence, she may be able to regain her ascendency over her former\r\ncolonies, can scarcely be so blind as not to perceive that but little\r\nattention would probably be paid to her claims by her more powerful\r\ncoadjutors in the work of our annihilation.\r\n\r\nIt does not appear, then, that these nations can urge even self-interest\r\nas a pretext for their treacherous enmity to us; and we again return to\r\nthe question, What is the cause of their continued unfriendliness?\r\n\r\nThe comparison of the nation to the individual has become hackneyed, but\r\nwe are forced to the conclusion that it is not alone true in\r\nconsiderations of policy and self-interest. Our experience has taught us\r\nthat it holds good in the fact that mere feelings of spiteful jealousy\r\nand envy can, in the most powerful communities, override the dictates of\r\njustice--nay, even of interest itself.\r\n\r\nAgain, a little examination will show that a permanent friendship is not\r\nto be expected between different nationalities, from the very nature of\r\ntheir structure. A nation is composed of individuals--of individuals\r\nwhose pursuits and principles are widely distinct. The parties formed\r\nfrom these different classes are often diametrically opposed to each\r\nother in their ideas of policy and government. Moreover, their relations\r\nwith foreign countries enter, to an important extent, into the counsels\r\nof every administration, and, as successive parties come into power, it\r\nis not to be expected that connections with other Governments will\r\nremain unchanged.\r\n\r\nThis does not apply to the course of those countries whose conduct we\r\nhave been considering, but it teaches us that we should never place\r\nreliance upon the long continuance of the friendship of any nation.\r\n\r\nThus, it has already been stated, that not one of what are commonly\r\nknown as the Great Powers can be depended upon for the slightest\r\ndemonstration of friendship. Russia has indeed been generally regarded\r\nas bearing toward us nothing but good will; yet friendly as her feelings\r\nmay be, it is owing mainly to the fact that she is so distant, and the\r\ninterests of the two countries are so widely separated, that she can\r\nhave no possible motive for turning against us; while, situated as she\r\nis, an object of dislike to the other European Governments, she could\r\nnot be insensible to the policy of conciliating so powerful a nation as\r\nour own.\r\n\r\nHow then shall we proceed in order to preserve ourselves from\r\ndifficulties in which the interests, jealousies, or changing policy of\r\nforeign countries may involve us? The answer has been made before--by\r\nbeing ever prepared to meet promptly all hostile demonstrations.\r\nSituated as we are, employing our resources to quell a gigantic\r\ninsurrection, we have no strength to waste in an _unnecessary_ foreign\r\nwar. But it should be remembered that if we had had an adequate force to\r\nresist a foreign enemy three years ago, the existing rebellion would\r\nnever have assumed its present proportions. We, who in our previous wars\r\nhad made ourselves formidable, intrusted our defence to a few thousand\r\nmen, distributed throughout our broad land, and, while the former valor\r\nof our sailors had enabled us to boast our superiority upon the sea, we\r\nexposed ourselves, by our reliance upon a small number of old\r\nmen-of-war, scattered over the world, to the sudden loss of our naval\r\nreputation. Large standing armaments are wisely discouraged by the\r\nConstitution, but an army of one hundred thousand men, an immense force\r\nfor some Governments, would be but a small one for our own.\r\n\r\nWe owe to our being situated apart from other nations, our ability to\r\ndispense with the military burdens which European rulers impose upon\r\ntheir subjects; but the increase of neither our land or naval power has\r\nbeen proportional to our own extension, or to those modern inventions\r\nand discoveries by which large forces can be easily and expeditiously\r\nmoved from point to point. An army, therefore, which less than half a\r\ncentury ago would have been ample, is at present far from sufficient for\r\nour protection.\r\n\r\nWe must, above all, recollect that as a Government can expect the\r\naffection and support of the people only when it shows that it possesses\r\nthe elements necessary to maintain itself and protect them, so it can\r\nlook for the friendship of other countries only when it causes to be\r\nseen that it is able and ready to resist any encroachment upon its\r\nrights.\r\n\r\nFor the present we must depend, in a measure, for an abstinence from\r\nopen demonstrations against us on the part of the nations above referred\r\nto, upon the moral sense of the world, which has doubtless, to a great\r\nextent, preserved us thus far. But while it is necessary to avoid giving\r\nany pretext for war, let no tame submission to insult or wrong lower us\r\nin the eyes of the world, and hereafter let it be our policy, by\r\ncommanding the respect and fear of foreign nations, to assure ourselves\r\nof their good will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTH AND SOUTH.\r\n\r\n  North and South the war cries come:\r\n  Sounds the trumpet, beats the drum.\r\n\r\n  Hosts contending, marshalled foes\r\n  Battle while the red blood flows.\r\n\r\n  Two great armies whose Ideal\r\n  Bursts into the earnest Real.\r\n\r\n  Ideals twain, on battle height\r\n  Flaming into radiant light!\r\n\r\n  One, is Freedom over all;\r\n  One, is Slavery's tyrant thrall:\r\n\r\n  These are written on the plain\r\n  'Mid the Battle's fiery rain.\r\n\r\n  These the Powers that must contend\r\n  To the dark and bitter end.\r\n\r\n  Look upon the Nation's dead!\r\n  Lo, the blood of martyrs shed!\r\n\r\n  Dying that our Country may\r\n  Know her Resurrection day!\r\n\r\n  What shall be the Traitor's gain?\r\n  Endless scorn, undying pain.\r\n\r\n  Ever o'er the giant wrong\r\n  Sings the Right her triumph song.\r\n\r\n  Yes, as sure as God doth reign\r\n  Right the mastery shall obtain!\r\n\r\n  Over all these beauteous lands\r\n  These two Brothers clasp their hands.\r\n\r\n  These two Brothers now at strife\r\n  Make one heart, one soul, one life!\r\n\r\n  This at last will be their song:\r\n  'One forever, free, and strong.'\r\n\r\n  Northmen, ye have not in hate\r\n  Closed the heart's fraternal gate!\r\n\r\n  Ye have not for greed, nor gold,\r\n  Forged the slave-chains manifold!\r\n\r\n  But in patience ye have wrought\r\n  Out your Godlike, freeborn thought!\r\n\r\n  Ye have toiled that man might be\r\n  Clothed with truth and liberty.\r\n\r\n  God hath answered from the skies;\r\n  Bids you for His own arise!\r\n\r\n  Now the work is at your door:\r\n  Help His meek and suffering poor!\r\n\r\n  There are hearts uncomforted,\r\n  Weeping o'er the battle-dead.\r\n\r\n  There are wounded brave ones here:\r\n  Bring your hearts of kindness near!\r\n\r\n  Freedmen shiver at your gate--\r\n  Let them not forgotten wait!\r\n\r\n  Bind the wounded heart that bleeds;\r\n  Mould your _speeches_ into _deeds!_\r\n\r\n  This is what all true hearts say:\r\n  'Glorious is our work to-day!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERARY NOTICES.\r\n\r\n\r\n     DREAMTHORP; A Book of Essays written in the Country. By\r\n     ALEXANDER SMITH, Author of 'A Life Drama,' 'City Poems,'\r\n     etc. Boston: J.E. Tilton & Company. For sale by Walter Low, 823\r\n     Broadway. New York.\r\n\r\nWe have been very unexpectedly charmed with this volume. Inverted and\r\nfantastical as he may be in his poems, Mr. Smith's essays are fresh,\r\nnatural, racy, and genial. They are models in their way, and we wish our\r\ncontributors would study them as such. Each essay is complete in itself;\r\nevery sentence full of interest; there is no straining for effect, no\r\nwriting to astonish a _blasé_ audience, no show of unwonted erudition;\r\nbut the light of a poet's soul, the sunshine of a calm and loving heart,\r\nare streaming and brooding over all these gentle pages. Knowledge is\r\nindeed within them, but it has ripened into wisdom; culture has matured\r\ninto wine with the summer in its glow--yet, notwithstanding its many\r\nexcellences, the book is so quiet, true, and natural, we know not what\r\nfavor it may find among us. We were pleased to see that in 'A Shelf in\r\nMy Book-case' our own Hawthorne had a conspicuous place. 'Twice-Told\r\nTales' is an especial favorite with Mr. Smith, as it indeed is with most\r\nimaginative people. His analysis of Hawthorne is very fine, and it is\r\nlike meeting with an old friend in a foreign land to come across the\r\nname so dear to ourselves in these pages from across the sea. Equally\r\npleasant to us is the Chapter on Vagabonds. 'A fellow feeling makes us\r\nwondrous kind,' and, confessing ourselves to be one of this genus, we\r\ndwell with delight on our author's genial description of their naive\r\npleasures and innocent eccentricities. Mr. Smith says: 'The true\r\nvagabond is to be met with among actors, poets, painters. These may grow\r\nin any way their nature dictates. They are not required to conform to\r\nany traditional pattern. A little more air and light should be let in\r\nupon life. I should think the world had stood long enough under the\r\ndrill of Adjutant Fashion. It is hard work; the posture is wearisome,\r\nand Fashion is an awful martinet and has a quick eye, and comes down\r\nmercilessly on the unfortunate wight who cannot square his toes to the\r\napproved pattern, or who appears upon parade with a darn in his coat or\r\nwith a shoulder belt insufficiently pipe-clayed. It is killing work.\r\nSuppose we try 'standing at ease' for a little?'\r\n\r\n\r\n    SCENES AND THOUGHTS IN EUROPE. By GEORGE H. CALVERT, Author of 'The\r\n    Gentleman.' Boston: Little, Brown & Company. A new edition of a work\r\n    first published in 1846.\r\n\r\nMr. Calvert is a writer of considerable vigor, but we think these\r\n'Scenes and Thoughts' seriously injured by the hatred of Catholicity\r\nwhich breathes everywhere through them. We miss in them the large,\r\nliberal, and loving spirit which characterized 'The Gentleman.' Charity\r\nis the soul of wisdom, and we can never rightly appreciate that which we\r\nhate. Mr. Calvert totally ignores all the good and humanizing effects of\r\nthe Catholic Church, and sees only the faults and follies of those who\r\nminister at her altars. Not the least cheering example of the progress\r\nwe are daily making, is the improvement in this respect in our late\r\nbooks of travels. We have ceased to denounce in learning to describe\r\naright, and feel the pulsations of a kindred heart, though it beat under\r\nthe scarlet robe of the cardinal, the dalmatic of the priest, or the\r\ncoarse serge of the friar. 'My son, give me thy heart,' says our God. If\r\nwe can deem from a life of self-abnegation a man has so done, we have\r\nceased inquiring into the dogmas of his creed. It is the heart and not\r\nthe intellect which is required, 'Little children, love one another,'\r\nis the true law of life, progress, and human happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n    SOUNDINGS FROM THE ATLANTIC, by OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES. Boston:\r\n    Ticknor & Fields. For sale by D. Appleton & Co., New York.\r\n\r\nAs the title indicates, the essays contained in this volume are already\r\nknown to the readers of _The Atlantic_.\r\n\r\nWherever Dr. Holmes sounds, he is sure to light upon pearls and golden\r\nsands, and scatter them about with a profusion so reckless that we feel\r\nconvinced the supply is not to be exhausted. Scientist and poet, analyst\r\nand creator, full of keen satire, genial humor, and tender pathos, who\r\nmay compete with him in varied gifts, or rival the charm of intellectual\r\ngrace which he breathes at will into all he writes?\r\n\r\nThe contents of this volume are: 'Bread and the Newspaper,' 'My Hunt\r\nAfter the Captain,' 'The Stereoscope and the Stereograph,' 'Sun Painting\r\nand Sun Sculpture,' 'Doings of the Sunbeam,' 'The Human Wheel, its\r\nSpokes and Felloes,' 'A Visit to the Autocrat's Landlady,' 'A Visit to\r\nthe Asylum for Aged and Decayed Punsters,' 'The Great Instrument,' 'The\r\nInevitable Trial.'\r\n\r\n\r\n     HINTS FOR THE NURSERY; or, The Young Mother's Guide. By\r\n     Mrs. C. A. HOPKINSON. Boston: Little, Brown & Company,\r\n     1863.

By ROBERT C. WINTHROP. Boston: Ticknor & Fields. For\r\n     sale by D. Appleton & Co., New York.\r\n\r\nThis work is dedicated to the Massachusetts Historical Society, who have\r\nhonored the author with their presidency for eight years past. It is\r\nrather an autobiography than a biography, and an autobiography of the\r\nmost trustworthy kind, 'written accidentally and unconsciously, as it\r\nwere, in familiar letters or private journals, or upon the records of\r\nofficial service.' Such a Life is the volume before us. The most skilful\r\nuse has been made of his material by our author. John Winthrop the\r\nelder, through contemporaneous records, in the familiar language of\r\nprivate correspondence and diary, tells us the story of a considerable\r\npart of his career in his own words, Cotton Mather says of him: ...\r\n'This third Adam Winthrop was the father of that renowned John Winthrop,\r\nwho was the father of New England, and the founder of a colony, which,\r\nupon many accounts, like him that founded it, may challenge the first\r\nplace among the English glories of America.'\r\n\r\nThe volume also offers us in great detail a picture not only of the\r\noutward life, but of the inmost thoughts, motives, and principles of the\r\nAmerican Puritans. Valuable to the antiquarian, it will also interest,\r\nin its naive pictures of home life, the general reader.\r\n\r\nThe brave and brilliant Theodore Winthrop, who gave up his young life to\r\nhis country in the battle of Big Bethel, has rendered this name dear to\r\nall loyal Americans.\r\n\r\n\r\n     ROUND THE BLOCK. An American Novel. With Illustrations.\r\n     New York: D. Appleton & Co., 443 and 445 Broadway.\r\n\r\nA Novel of American life, incident, and character. The style is easy,\r\nthe tale interesting, the moral healthful. There is considerable humor\r\nin the delineation of character. The people drawn are such as we have\r\nall known, sketched without exaggeration, and actuated by constantly\r\noccurring motives. The book is anonymous, but we believe the author will\r\nyet be known to fame, Tiffles and Patching are true to life, and the\r\nexhibition of the 'Pannyrarmer' worthy of Dickens.\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE LIFE OF JESUS. By ERNEST RENAN, Membre de\r\n     l'Institut. Translated from the original French by Charles Edwin\r\n     Wilbour, translator of 'Les Misérables.' New York: Carlton,\r\n     publisher, 413 Broadway.\r\n\r\nA book which has attained a sudden and wide circulation, if not a\r\nlasting popularity, in France. We look upon it as a _romance_ based upon\r\nthe Sacred History of the Gospels. It is artistically constructed, and\r\nwritten with considerable genius. 'It is dramatic, beginning with a\r\npastoral and ending with the direst of human tragedies.' M. Renan we\r\nsuppose to be a Pantheist. He says: 'As to myself, I think that there is\r\nnot in the universe an intelligence superior to that of man.' This view\r\nof course leads him to discard supernaturalism, and write of Christ as\r\nsimply man. He believes as suits his system, and refuses\r\ntestimony--without condescending to tell us why it is not equally as\r\nvalid as that received. He says: 'The highest consciousness of God that\r\never existed in the bosom of humanity, was that of Jesus.' He is the\r\n'universal ideal'--and yet we think he strives to make of this\r\n'universal ideal' an impostor! Christ tells us of various facts with\r\nregard to himself: of his divine Sonhood and mission--if these things\r\nare not true, then was he either weakly self-deceived or a wilful\r\ndeceiver. He sets up a claim to the working of miracles, and assumes the\r\npart of the Messiah of the prophets. This want of truth M. Renan smooths\r\nover by saying: 'Sincerity with oneself had not much meaning with\r\nOrientals; they are little habituated to the delicate distinctions of\r\nthe critical spirit!' The resurrection of Lazarus, as he represents it,\r\nwas a pious fraud managed by the apostles, agreed to by the Master,\r\n'because he knew not how to conquer the greediness of the crowd and of\r\nhis own disciples for the marvellous.' Does not the mere fact of such an\r\nacquiescence argue the impostor? Christ seeks death to deliver himself\r\nfrom his fearful embarrassments! Did he really rise from the dead? M.\r\nRenan tells us, with a sickly sentimentalism worthy of Michelet: 'The\r\npowerful imagination of Mary of Magdala played in that affair a capital\r\npart. Divine power of love! Sacred moments, when the passion of a\r\nvisionary gives to the world a resuscitated God.' If this be indeed the\r\nLife of Jesus, well may we exclaim with the apostle: 'If in this life\r\nonly we have hope in Christ, we are, of all men, the most miserable.'\r\nAnd is this all that the most advanced naturalism can do? All that human\r\ngenius and erudition can offer us? All that artistic grace and\r\ntenderness can win for us? Clouds and darkness rise before us as we\r\nread, the mother of our Lord loses her sanctity, Jesus becomes an\r\nimpostor, the apostles deceivers, human testimony is forever dishonored.\r\nA pall shrouds the infinite blue of the sky, and our beloved dead seem\r\nfestering in eternal corruption!\r\n\r\nWe must confess we prefer the bold and defiant scepticism of Voltaire,\r\nto the Judas kiss of M. Renan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITOR'S TABLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nART ITEMS.\r\n\r\nAmong our exchanges is a little periodical entitled '_The New Path_,\r\npublished by the Society for the Advancement of Truth in Art.' The\r\nmembers of this Society are otherwise known as 'Pre-Raphaelites,' in\r\nother words, as seekers of the Ancient Path, trodden before certain\r\nmannerisms had corrupted the minds of many painters and most technical\r\nconnoisseurs. Their aims and principles are, so far as they go, pure and\r\nlofty. Truth in Art is a noble thing. But can these gentlemen find none\r\noutside of their own society? The face of nature is very dear to us, and\r\nduring long years have we closely observed its forms, its changing hues\r\nand expressions. We do like when we look at a picture to know whether\r\nthe trees be oaks, elms, or pines; whether the rocks be granitic,\r\nvolcanic, or stratified; whether the foliage be of spring, midsummer, or\r\nautumn; even whether the foreground herbage be of grasses or\r\nbroad-leaved weeds; but is there no danger that minutiæ may absorb too\r\nmuch attention, that the larger parts may be lost in the lesser, that\r\nwhile each weed tells its own story, the distant mountains, the\r\natmosphere, the whole picture, in short, may fail to tell us theirs in\r\nany interesting or even intelligible manner? In excess of surface\r\ndetails, may we not lose body, roundness; and, in matching exact color\r\nrather than the effect of color through the tremulous ether, may not the\r\nsubtle mysteries of distance, of actually diffused and all-suffusing\r\nlight, escape the painter? It is possible to possess the body and fail\r\nto grasp the life. Give us not blotchy nondescripts for natural objects,\r\nfling to the winds all narrow, school-made, conventional ideas, but, in\r\ngiving us the real, give us the ideal also; otherwise we freeze, missing\r\nthe spirit which should warm and shine through the letter.\r\n\r\nWe fear lest in his zeal for truth, many a Pre-Raphaelite may be led to\r\noverlook beauty. To a finite mind the two words are by no means\r\nsynonymous. There can be no _real_ beauty without truth, but many truths\r\nare not beautiful, and beauty, no less than truth, is an important\r\ningredient in that complex resultant, Art.\r\n\r\nWe quote from one of the articles of organization of the above-named\r\nSociety: 'The right course for young artists is faithful and loving\r\nrepresentations of Nature, selecting nothing and rejecting nothing,\r\nseeking only to express the greatest possible amount of fact.' Now we\r\nall know that the best way to stultify the mind and conception of a\r\nyouthful student, in any branch of art, is to keep before him\r\ncommonplace models. Indeed, what student gifted with genius, or even\r\nwith any high degree of talent, will not (if unrestrained) himself\r\nselect as studies, not any mere chronicle of desired facts, but the most\r\nsignificant forms (suited to his proficiency) in which he can find those\r\nfacts embodied?\r\n\r\nThe article quoted must be based upon the belief that there are no\r\ncommonplace, ugly objects in nature. If we sit down and reason over, or\r\nuse our microscopes upon any work of the Almighty, we can find wisdom\r\nand beauty therein, but that does not alter the fact that beauty and\r\nsignificance are distributed in degrees of more and less. 'Art is long\r\nand time is fleeting,' and the genuine artist has no hours to waste over\r\nthe less significant and characteristic. Besides, each student deserving\r\nthe name, has his own individuality, and will naturally select, and the\r\nmore lovingly paint, objects in accordance with his especial bent of\r\nmind. Not that we would have him become one-sided, and neglect the study\r\nof matters that might some day be useful; but in this, as in all things\r\nelse, he must temper feeling with judgment, and make the mechanical\r\nexecution the simple, faithful handmaiden to truly imaginative\r\nconception.\r\n\r\nIn the moral world we may cheerfully accept physical deformity for the\r\nsake of some elevated principle therewith developed; but in the realm of\r\nart, man's only sphere of creation, we want the best the artist can give\r\nus, the greatest truth with the highest beauty. We are not willing to\r\ntake the truth without the beauty. If we are to be told that sunlight\r\ntipping the edges of trees produces certain effects upon those edges and\r\nthe shadowed foliage behind, let the fact be worthily represented, and\r\nnot so prosily set forth that the picture shall be to us simply a matter\r\nof curiosity. That those trees did actually stand and grow thus, is\r\nsmall comfort, for the artist might surely have found other and more\r\ninteresting forms telling the same tale. If light falling through loose\r\nfoliage does indeed make upon the garments of a lad lying beneath spots\r\nat a little distance wonderfully like mildew, then rather let the boy\r\nsit for us under a tree of denser foliage, where a pathetic subject will\r\nnot risk an unintentionally comic treatment. If a stone-breaker's face\r\ncorrupts in purple spots at a certain period after death, we would\r\nprefer him painted before corruption, and consequently hideousness, had\r\nbegun. If women will wear gowns ugly in color and form, and will sit or\r\nstand in graceless positions, we can readily avoid such subjects, and\r\nbestow our careful finish upon more worthy models.\r\n\r\nLet us not be misunderstood; we well know that the humorous, the\r\ngrotesque, the sublime may use ugliness to serve their own legitimate\r\npurposes, but then that ugliness must be humorous, grotesque, or\r\nsublime, and not flat, prosy, or revolting. A blemish is by no means\r\nnecessarily an ugliness. A leaf nibbled by insects and consequently\r\ndiscolored, a lad with ragged jacket and soiled trowsers, a peasant girl\r\nwith bent hat and tattered gown, are often more picturesque objects than\r\nthe perfect leaf or the well-attired child.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of a certain artist, _The New Path_ says: 'He follows nature as\r\nlong as she is graceful and does not offend his eye, but once let her\r\nmake what strikes him as a discord, and which is a discord, of course,\r\nfor she, the great poet, makes no music without discords--and,\r\nstraightway, Mr. ---- takes out the offending note, smooths it down, and\r\nthinks he has bettered nature's work.' Now, in music there are no\r\n_discords_; so soon as a discord is admitted, the sounds cease to be\r\nmusic;--there are _dissonances_, peculiar and unusual combinations of\r\nair vibrations, but these are never long dwelt on, and must always be\r\nresolved into the full and satisfactory harmony, of which the beauty is\r\nenhanced by the momentary lapse into strangeness. Dissonance is never\r\nthe prevailing idea, and above all, never the final, closing one; it\r\nmust always bear a certain relation to the key in which it is used, and\r\nthe musical composition must be ended by the fullest and most\r\nsatisfactory chord, or suggestion of a chord, found in that key.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the Pre-Raphaelite school are willing to admit that\r\n'there is but one Turner, and Ruskin is his prophet.' Let us then hear\r\n_one_ of the views which the eloquent oracle has advanced in connection\r\nwith this subject. After advising the non-imaginative painter to remain\r\nin the region of the purely topographical or historical landscape, he\r\ncontinues; 'But, beyond this, let him note that though historical\r\ntopography forbids _alteration_ (did Turner heed this precept?), it\r\nneither forbids sentiment nor choice. So far from doing this, the proper\r\nchoice of subject is an absolute duty to the topographical painter: he\r\nshould first take care that it is a subject intensely pleasing to\r\nhimself, else he will never paint it well; and then also, that it shall\r\nbe one in some sort pleasurable to the general public, else it is not\r\nworth painting at all; and lastly, take care that it be instructive, as\r\nwell as pleasurable to the public, else it is not worth painting with\r\ncare. I should particularly insist at present on this careful choice of\r\nsubject, because the Pre-Raphaelites, taken as a body, have been\r\nculpably negligent in this respect, not in humble honor of Nature, but\r\nin morbid indulgence of their own impressions. They happen to find their\r\nfancies caught by a bit of an oak hedge, or the weeds at the sides of a\r\nduck pond, because, perhaps, they remind them of a stanza of Tennyson;\r\nand forthwith they sit down to sacrifice the most consummate skill, two\r\nor three months of the best summer time available for outdoor work\r\n(equivalent to some seventieth or sixtieth of all their lives), and\r\nnearly all their credit with the public, to this duck-pond delineation.\r\nNow it is indeed quite right that they should see much to be loved in\r\nthe hedge, nor less in the ditch; but it is utterly and inexcusably\r\nwrong that they should neglect the nobler scenery, which is full of\r\nmajestic interest, or enchanted by historical association; so that, as\r\nthings go at present, we have all the commonalty, that may be seen\r\nwhenever we choose, painted properly; but all of lovely and wonderful,\r\nwhich we cannot see but at rare intervals, painted vilely: the castles\r\nof the Rhine and Rhone made vignettes of for the annuals; and the\r\nnettles and mushrooms, which were prepared by nature eminently for\r\nnettle porridge and fish sauce, immortalized by art as reverently as if\r\nwe were Egyptians, and they deities.'\r\n\r\nWant of space forbids further extracts, but we recommend the entire\r\nchapter: Of Turnerian Topography, Modern Painters, vol. iv., to the\r\nperusal of our readers.\r\n\r\nWe are glad to see the national mind beginning to effervesce on art\r\nsubjects. The most opposite views, the new and the old, the conventional\r\nand the truly imaginative, the severely real and the more\r\nlatitudinarian, the earnest and the flippant, the pedantic and the\r\nbroad, far reaching--will continue to clash for a season, while a school\r\nof American Landscape is, we think, destined to rise steadily through\r\nthe chaotic elements, and to reach a height of excellence to which the\r\nconscientious efforts of all advocates of the highest Truth in Art will\r\nhave greatly contributed.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to Mr. Cropsey for a pleasant opportunity to visit his\r\nstudio (No. 625 Broadway), and see such pictures and sketches as he now\r\nhas by him, the results of a long residence abroad and of his summer\r\nwork among the hills of Sussex, N. J. A view of Korfe Castle,\r\nDorsetshire, England, is a highly-finished and evidently accurate\r\nrepresentation of that interesting spot. We are presumed to be standing\r\namid the ferns, flowers, and vines of the foreground, and looking off\r\ntoward the castle-crowned hill, the village at its foot, and the\r\nfar-away downs, with a silver stream winding into the distance. A\r\nrainbow quivers among the retreating clouds to the right, and from the\r\nleft comes the last brilliant light of day, gilding the greenery of the\r\nhills, and throwing out the deepened hues of the long shadows. There are\r\nalso pleasant views of other English scenery, of Italian landscape, and\r\nof American lakes and streams. Mr. Cropsey has a high reputation both\r\nat home and abroad, and we are glad to learn that for the present, at\r\nleast, he intends to pursue his art labors within the limits of his\r\nnative land.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Beethoven's Fidelio_.--This noble opera has lately been given us by Mr.\r\nAnschütz, with the best use of such means as were at his disposal. The\r\norchestral, choral, and concerted vocal portions are grand and\r\nbeautiful, highly characteristic and effective. The story is simple,\r\npure, and deeply pathetic. The prison scene affords scope for the finest\r\nhistrionic abilities. In the solos, however (with the exception of that\r\nof Pizarro, where dramatic power satisfies), we miss the lyric genius of\r\nthe Italians, their long-phrased, passionate, and never-to-be-forgotten\r\nmelodies, containing the element of beauty _per se_ so richly developed.\r\nCannot the whole world produce one man, who, with all the expanded\r\nmusical knowledge of the present day, can unite for us Italian gift of\r\nmelody and German power of orchestral and choral effect, whose\r\nendowments shall be both lyric and dramatic, and whose taste shall be\r\npure, refined, and ennobling? Should we recognize such a genius were he\r\nactually to stand in our midst, or would both schools reject him because\r\nhe chanced to possess the best qualities of either?\r\n\r\n                                            L. D. P.\r\n\r\n\r\nBallads of the War\r\n\r\nTHE BROTHER'S BURIAL.\r\n\r\nBY ISABELLA McFARLANE.\r\n\r\n  Hear me, stranger, hear me tell\r\n  How my gallant brother fell.\r\n\r\n  We were rushing on the foe,\r\n  When a bullet laid him low.\r\n\r\n  At my very side he fell--\r\n  He whom I did love so well.\r\n\r\n  On we rushed--I could not stay--\r\n  There I left him where he lay.\r\n\r\n  Then when fled the rebel rout,\r\n  I came back and searched him out.\r\n\r\n  Wounded, bleeding, suffering, dying,\r\n  Midst a heap of dead men lying.\r\n\r\n  Friend and foe above each other--\r\n  There I found my mangled brother.\r\n\r\n  Blind with tears, I lifted him:\r\n  But his eyes were sunk and dim.\r\n\r\n  'Brother, when I'm dead,' said he,\r\n  'Find some box to coffin me.'\r\n\r\n  For he could not bear to rest\r\n  With the cold earth on his breast.\r\n\r\n  All around the camp I sought;\r\n  Box for coffin found I not.\r\n\r\n  Still I searched and hunted round--\r\n  Three waste cracker-boxes found;\r\n\r\n  Nailed them fast to one another,--\r\n  Laid therein my precious brother!\r\n\r\n  Then a grave for him I made,\r\n  Hands and bayonet all my spade.\r\n\r\n  Long I worked, yet 'twas not deep:\r\n  There I laid him down to sleep.\r\n\r\n  There I laid my gallant brother:\r\n  Earth contains not such another!\r\n\r\n  Little more than boys were we,\r\n  I sixteen, and nineteen he.\r\n\r\n  For his country's sake he died,\r\n  And for her I'd lie beside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] But a copy fell into the hands of a French bookseller, who published\r\na wretched translation, and Jefferson authorized an edition in London in\r\n1787.\r\n\r\n[B] A statue was erected to Buffon with the inscription:\r\n\r\nNATURAM AMPLECTITUR OMNEM.\r\n\r\nSome sceptic wrote underneath:\r\n\r\nQUI TROP EMBRASSE, MAL ÉTREINT;\r\n\r\na saying which we do not care to translate, but which is too good a\r\ndescription of Jefferson's scientific acquirements to be omitted.\r\n\r\n[C] I am told that there was no resisting her smile; and that she had at\r\nher command, in moments of grief, a certain look of despair which filled\r\neven the roughest hearts with sympathy, and won over the kindest to the\r\ncruel cause.",
