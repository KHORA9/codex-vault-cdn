H. HOLCOMBE, M. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NEW ORLEANS:\r\n  PRINTED AT THE DELTA MAMMOTH JOB OFFICE,\r\n  1860.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ALTERNATIVE:\r\n\r\nA Separate Nationality, or the Africanization of the South.\r\n\r\n\r\nA sectional party, inimical to our institutions, and odious to our\r\npeople, is about taking possession of the Federal Government. The seed\r\nsown by the early Abolitionists has yielded a luxurious harvest. When\r\nLincoln is in place, Garrison will be in power. The Constitution, either\r\nopenly violated or emasculated of its true meaning and spirit by the\r\nsubtleties of New England logic, is powerless for protection. We are no\r\nlonger partners to a federal compact, but the victims of a consolidated\r\ndespotism. Opposition to slavery, to its existence, its extension and\r\nits perpetuation, is the sole cohesive element of the triumphant\r\nfaction. It did not receive the countenance of a single vote in any one\r\nof the ten great cotton States of the South! The question is at length\r\nplainly presented: submission or secession. The only alternative left us\r\nis this: _a separate nationality or the Africanization of the South_.\r\n\r\nHe has not analyzed this subject aright nor probed it to the bottom, who\r\nsupposes that the real quarrel between the North and the South is about\r\nthe Territories, or the decision of the Supreme Court, or even the\r\nConstitution itself; and that, consequently, the issues may be stayed\r\nand the dangers arrested by the drawing of new lines and the signing of\r\nnew compacts. The division is broader and deeper and more incurable than\r\nthis. The antagonism is fundamental and ineradicable. The true secret of\r\nit lies in the total reversion of public opinion which has occured in\r\nboth sections of the country in the last quarter of a century on the\r\nsubject of slavery.\r\n\r\nIt has not been more than twenty-five years since Garrison was dragged\r\nthrough the streets of Boston with a rope around his neck, for uttering\r\nAbolition sentiments; and not thirty years since, the abolition of\r\nslavery was seriously debated in the Legislature of Virginia. Now, on\r\nthe contrary, the radical opinions of Sumner, Emerson and Parker, and\r\nthe assassination schemes of John Brown, are applauded in Fanueil Hall,\r\nand the whole Southern mind with an unparalelled unanimity, regards the\r\ninstitution of slavery as righteous and just, ordained of God, and to be\r\nperpetuated by man. We do not propose to analyze the causes of this\r\nremarkable revolution, which will constitute one of the strangest\r\nchapters of history. The fact is unquestionable. To understand\r\nrationally the events which are transpiring, and to forsee their\r\ninevitable issue, it is necessary to examine this element of discord\r\nbetween the Northern and Southern people, to investigate its true nature\r\nand extent, and weigh carefully the prospect of its cure.\r\n\r\nThe Northern mind has become thoroughly anti-slavery in sentiment. Even\r\nthose who contend for our constitutional rights share in the universal\r\nopinion that slavery is a great moral and social evil. Those who have\r\nadopted the pro-slavery view are exceedingly few in numbers, and are\r\nregarded by the mass of Northern people as more fanatical than the most\r\nextreme Abolitionist. The press, the pulpit, the rostrum of the North\r\nare clamorous with declamation against us and our institutions. Slavery\r\nis considered not only immoral but debasing to both owner and owned. It\r\nis, they say, a relic of barbarism and a disgrace to an enlightened\r\npeople. We are not regarded as equals but are merely tolerated, as\r\npersons whom they in their wisdom may possibly reform and improve.\r\nChurches refuse us participation in religious rites, and a baleful\r\nelement of religious hate adds fuel to the fire of political dissension.\r\nFrom present appearances, the North will before very long be unanimous\r\nin opinion, and if it has the power or can invent the means, it will be\r\nready to reduce the South to the condition of Hayti and Jamaica, and\r\nexpect the approval of God upon the atrocity.\r\n\r\nIt is unquestionably true, although it be upon false issues, that the\r\nsympathies of the civilized world are united against us. The name of\r\nslavery is hateful to the ears of freemen and of those who desire to be\r\nfree. The wise and just subordination of an inferior to a superior race,\r\nis rashly confounded with the old systems of oppression and tyranny,\r\nwhich stain the pages of history and have excited the righteous\r\nindignation of the world. We are supposed to have proved recreant to the\r\ngreat principles and examples of the liberators of mankind. It is almost\r\nimpossible at present to disabuse the public mind of Europe and of the\r\nNorth of this shallow prejudice. In the meantime, whilst carrying out\r\nthe designs of Providence in relation to the negro race, we must rest\r\nfor a while under a cloud of obloquy and abuse. Let us be faithful to\r\nour sublime trust, and future ages will appreciate the grandeur and\r\nglory of our mission.\r\n\r\nThe pro-slavery sentiment is of recent development. It is more recent\r\nthan any of the great inventions which have created the distinctive\r\nforms of our modern civilization. It is more recent than many of the\r\ngreat innovations of thought which now agitate mankind. The great and\r\ngood fathers of our Republic unquestionably entertained anti-slavery\r\nsentiments or predilections, and the flippant Abolitionist thinks he has\r\nsilenced us forever by quoting the opinions of Washington and Jefferson\r\nand Madison on this subject. The anti-slavery sentiment of that era was\r\npartly derived from the radical influence of the French revolution, the\r\nmad frenzies of which fearful convulsion, the fanatics of the North may\r\nyet repeat in the Western hemisphere. It was partially also deduced\r\nfrom narrow, uncertain and sometimes false premises. The lapse of time\r\nhas secured us a better stand-point. Africa has been explored and the\r\nAfrican studied, anatomically, socially, morally, ethnologically and\r\nhistorically. Not only the physical science of man but the philosophy of\r\nhistory itself has been almost created since the days of the revolution.\r\nThe question of slavery has been thoroughly sifted. The metaphysical and\r\ntheological as well as the political bearings of the subject have been\r\nclosely scrutinized. Liberia is before us with its feeble and precarious\r\nexistence, with its little torch of civilization nearly extinguished by\r\nthe foul atmosphere of surrounding heathenism. St. Domingo is before us\r\nwith its bloody teachings, and Jamaica with its silent monitors of\r\npauperism and decay. The meagre slave population of the last century has\r\nincreased to four millions. Cotton and sugar have risen to an\r\nunparalleled political and industrial importance, so that the whole\r\ncivilized world is deeply interested in its maintenance of African\r\nslavery. And lastly, though not leastly, the free negro settlements in\r\nthe North and in Canada are social experiments for our analysis and\r\ninstruction.\r\n\r\nThis pro-slavery party includes, with insignificant exceptions, nine\r\nmillions of people of Anglo-Saxon blood. It is diffused over territory\r\nsufficient for a mighty empire. It contends that its principles are\r\nbased upon large and safe inductions, made from an immense accumulation\r\nof facts in natural science, political economy and social ethics. It\r\nholds the most prominent material interests, and thereby the peace of\r\nthe world in its hands; a wise provision of Providence for its\r\nprotection, since those who cannot be controlled by reason, may be\r\nwithheld by fear.\r\n\r\nIn opposition to the prevailing sentiment of the North, we believe that\r\nmen are created neither free nor equal. They are born unequal in\r\nphysical and mental endowments, and no possible circumstances or culture\r\ncould ever raise the negro race to any genuine equality with the white.\r\nMan is born dependant, and the very first step in civilization was for\r\none man to enslave another. A state of slavery has been a disciplinary\r\nordeal to every people who have ever developed beyond the savage\r\ncondition. Those who cannot be reduced to bondage, like the American\r\nIndian, perish in their isolated and defiant barbarism. Freedom is the\r\nlast result, the crowning glory of the long and difficult evolution of\r\nhuman society. Few nations have yet attained to that lofty standard.\r\nThose who say that the French, the Italians or the Prussians, are not\r\nyet fit for freedom, and are still unable to appreciate the blessings of\r\nconstitutional liberty, would thrust the splendid privilege of\r\nAnglo-Saxon superiority upon the semi-barbarous negro! What folly, what\r\nmadness!\r\n\r\nMan has no \"inalienable rights\"--not even those of \"life, liberty, and\r\nthe pursuit of happiness.\" If the life he leads, the liberty he enjoys,\r\nand the happiness he pursues, are not consistent with the order and\r\nwell-being of society, he may righteously be deprived of them all.\r\nInstead of that \"glittering generality,\" which might serve as a motto\r\nfor the wildest anarchy, the truth is, that men and races of men have\r\ncertain natural capacities and duties, and the right to use the one and\r\ndischarge the other. That government is the best, and its people the\r\nhappiest, not in which all are free and equal, but in which equal races\r\nare free, and the inferior race is wisely and humanely subordinated to\r\nthe superior, whilst both are controlled by the sacred bonds of\r\nreciprocal duty.\r\n\r\nThe negro is a permanent variety of the human race, inferior to almost\r\nall others in intellect, but possessing an emotional nature capable of\r\nthe most beautiful cultivation. The greater part of this race in its\r\nnative Africa is sunk in the deepest barbarism. What little civilization\r\na few tribes may have, has been imposed upon them by Arabic and Moorish\r\nconquerors. Left to themselves, these poor people would no doubt remain\r\nbarbarous forever; but when domesticated by the white man, they are\r\nelevated and christianized. The transfer in their bondage, from black\r\nmen to white men, by the slave trade, was the first dawn of promise to\r\nthe benighted children of Africa. It was permitted by God in order to\r\nteach us the way in which the dark races are to be elevated and\r\ncivilized. Jamaica and Hayti have also been permitted, as timely and\r\nsalutary warnings, not to desert the path which was marked out by\r\nProvidence.\r\n\r\nAfrican slavery is therefore a certain relation of capital and labor, in\r\nwhich capital owns its labor and is bound to maintain and protect it. It\r\nis only thus that an inferior race can exist in contact with a superior\r\none. In the Sandwich Islands, in Australia, in New Zealand, the\r\naborigines are passing away before the encroachments of English power\r\nand at the mere presence of English civilization. The free negroes of\r\nthe North are dying out beneath the cold climate and the colder\r\ncharities of that region. Freedom and competition with the white man\r\nwould ultimately annihilate the negro race in the South. The only hope\r\nof the African is in his just subordination to the superior type.\r\n\r\nCertain physical and spiritual peculiarities of the negro necessitate\r\nhis subjection to the white man. It is for his own good that he is\r\nsubjected. As long as this was doubtful or not clearly seen, the South\r\nitself was opposed to slavery. It remonstrated with England for imposing\r\nthe institution upon it, and with Massachusetts for insisting upon a\r\ncontinuance of the slave-trade for twenty years after the adoption of\r\nthe federal compact. The South is now fully convinced of the benefits\r\nand blessings it is conferring upon the negro race. It is beginning to\r\ncatch a glimpse of the true nature and extent of its mission in relation\r\nto this vast and growing institution. The government of the South is to\r\nprotect it; the Church of the South is to christianize it; the people of\r\nthe South are to love it, and improve it and perfect it. God has\r\nlightened our task and secured its execution by making our interests\r\nhappily coincide with our duty.\r\n\r\nWe anticipate no terminus to the institution of slavery. It is the means\r\nwhereby the white man is to subdue the tropics all around the globe to\r\norder and beauty, and to the wants and interests of an ever-expanding\r\ncivilization. What may happen afar off in the periods of a millenial\r\nChristianity we cannot foresee. No doubt the Almighty in his wisdom and\r\nmercy has blessings in store for the poor negro, so that he will no\r\nlonger envy the earlier and more imposing development and fortunes of\r\nhis brethren. Some shining Utopia will beckon him also with beautiful\r\nillusion into the shadowy future. But with those remote possibilities we\r\nneed not trouble ourselves. His present duty is evidently \"to labor and\r\nto wait.\"\r\n\r\nThe Southern view of the matter, destined to revolutionize opinion\r\nthroughout the civilized world, is briefly this: African slavery is no\r\nretrograde movement, no discord in the harmony of nature, no violation\r\nof elemental justice, no infraction of immutable laws, human or\r\ndivine--but an integral link in the grand progressive evolution of human\r\nsociety as an indissoluble whole.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine that there exists an \"irrepressible conflict\" between free\r\nlabor and slave labor is as false as it is mischievous. Their true\r\nrelation is one of beautiful interchange and eternal harmony. When each\r\nis restricted to the sphere for which God and nature designed it, they\r\nboth contribute their full quotas to the physical happiness, material\r\ninterests, and social and spiritual progress of the race. They will\r\nprove to be not antagonistic but complementary to each other in the\r\ngreat work of human civilization. From this time forth, the subjugation\r\nof tropical nature to man; the elevation and christianization of the\r\ndark races, the feeding and clothing of the world, the diminution of\r\ntoil and the amelioration of all the asperities of life, the industrial\r\nprosperity and the peace of nations, and the further glorious evolutions\r\nof Art, Science, Literature and Religion, will depend upon the amicable\r\nadjustment, the co-ordination, the indissoluble compact between these\r\ntwo social systems, now apparently rearing their hostile fronts in the\r\nNorthern and Southern sections of this country.\r\n\r\nThe only \"irrepressible conflict\" is between pro-slavery and\r\nanti-slavery opinion: Here indeed collision may be inconceivably\r\ndisastrous, and fanaticism may thrust her sickle into the harvest of\r\ndeath. The pro-slavery sentiment is unconquerable. It will be more and\r\nmore suspicious of encroachment and jealous of its rights. It will\r\nsubmit to no restriction, and scouts the possibility of any \"ultimate\r\nextinction.\" Nothing will satisfy us but a radical change of opinion, or\r\nat least of political action on the subject of slavery throughout the\r\nNorthern States. The relation of master and slave must be recognized as\r\nright and just, as national and perpetual. The Constitution must be\r\nconstrued in the spirit of its founders, as an instrument to protect the\r\nminority from the domination of an insolent majority. The slavery\r\nquestion must be eliminated forever from the political issues of the\r\nday. No party which contemplates the restriction of our system and its\r\nultimate extinction can be tolerated for a moment. In assuming this bold\r\nattitude we simply assert our obvious rights and discharge our\r\ninevitable duty.\r\n\r\nNow the Northern mind is equally determined and defiant. It has\r\nliterally gone mad in its hostility to our institutions. The most\r\nconservative of the Republican party look forward complacently to the\r\nrestriction and ultimate extinction of slavery, in other words, to the\r\nAfricanization of the South and our national destruction. We will see to\r\nit that they precipitate no such calamity upon us, and we warn them to\r\nlook carefully to their own fate. When a Northern Confederacy can no\r\nlonger like a vampire suck the blood of the sleeping and compliant\r\nSouth; when agrarianism and atheism and fanaticism and socialism do\r\ntheir perfect work in a crowded and crowding population, will not the\r\ndark enigmas of free-labor civilization press heavily upon it, and the\r\ndread images evoked by the prophetic wisdom of Macauley arise\r\nindeed--taxation, monopoly, oppression, misery of the masses,\r\nrevolution, standing armies, despotism, &c.? It may yet deserve the\r\nstrange epitaph written for this nation by Elwood Fisher:\r\n\r\n     \"Here lies a people, who, in attempting to liberate the negro, lost\r\n     their own freedom.\"\r\n\r\nHave we rightly comprehended the fearful import of those words, _the\r\nAfricanization of the South_? According to the present rate of increase,\r\nin fifty years the negroes of these States will amount to twenty\r\nmillions. Suppose them to be restricted to their present arena. Suppose\r\nthem in addition to be free. Imagine the misery, the crime, the poverty,\r\nthe barbarism, the desolation of the country! The grass would grow in\r\nthe streets of our cities, our ships would rot in their harbors, our\r\nplantations would become a wilderness of cane-brakes. The re-subjugation\r\nof the negro, or the extermination of one race or the other would be\r\ninevitable, and in any event our children would be beggared with an\r\ninheritance of woe. Let us swear upon the altar of God, that as\r\nChristians and citizens we will resist to the death the first step which\r\nmight lead us towards this awful abyss!\r\n\r\nIf the Republican party is permitted to get into power, the\r\nAfricanization of the South may be gradual, but it will be sure. Their\r\nleaders already boast to applauding multitudes that the heel of the\r\nNorth is at last on our necks. When the power, the patronage, the\r\nprestige of the federal government are wielded against slavery; when\r\nSouthern men take office under it, and first apologize and then approve;\r\nwhen a free-soil sentiment gradually percolates through the South\r\nitself; when the brightness of Southern honor is tarnished, and the\r\nintegrity of Southern opinion destroyed, what will be, what must be the\r\ninevitable result? Nothing hasty or violent will be attempted. The\r\niniquity will be accomplished under the forms of the present\r\nConstitution. Remember that the coins of Nero bore the image of the\r\nGoddess of Liberty, and that a perverted Constitution is the choicest\r\ninstrument of tyranny. Lulled by pleasant narcotics, we will pass from\r\ndreams of security, into the sleep of death. Or if we rouse ourselves at\r\nlast, and reach out for our fallen thunderbolts, we will be found, like\r\nSampson, blind and helpless, and they will make sport of our misery. The\r\nsilken cords with which they bind us now, will change to iron fetters in\r\nour moment of revolt.\r\n\r\nThe precedent alone would be fatal. Shall we submit to an administration\r\nwhich received not a single vote in ten of our States? We could not be\r\nrepresented in its cabinet, nor in any foreign mission, for what\r\nSouthern gentleman of proper sensibilities would accept office at its\r\nhands? The South would be unrepresented at home or abroad. She would\r\nhave received a blow, politically, socially and morally, which would\r\nensure her destruction. This is precisely what Seward, Beecher and\r\nGreeley are aiming at. We are to be coaxed, cheated, legislated out of\r\nour rights and liberties. What cannot be achieved by trickery, will at\r\nlength be attempted by force. The most hateful feature in the despotism\r\nwhich threaten us is its religious element. If we are outraged because\r\nthe Constitution is violated and broken, what shall we say of those\r\nhypocrites or madmen who have perverted the Word of God to the most\r\ndetestable purposes of man!\r\n\r\nThe true test of statesmanship, according to Burke, is to preserve and\r\nimprove, not to abolish and destroy. We apply this to the institution of\r\nslavery, and are willing to accord it to the existing Union: Have we\r\nexhausted our Constitutional remedies? Is not the Republican party\r\npowerless for injury, and may we not anticipate a thorough reversion of\r\nNorthern judgment? These questions, and others like them, have been met\r\nand answered a thousand times by the able leaders of the South. Nothing\r\nbut the speedy and universal uprising of the Northern people in behalf\r\nof State rights and Southern equality can preserve the Union. They have\r\ncommitted the aggressions, let them make the overtures. Is this miracle\r\nto be expected, and are we to await credulously its accomplishment?\r\nCompromises and compacts, the temporary make-shifts of politicians and\r\nphilanthropists, will be useless. With what ingenuity the most sacred\r\ncompact may be perverted, with what facility the most perfect compromise\r\nmay be broken! You may put a new piece on the old garment, but the rent\r\nwill be made worse.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, the Constitution is dead, for it carried with it the seeds\r\nof its own dissolution. The Union has achieved its mission; the last\r\npage of its history is written, and it may be safely deposited in the\r\nglorious archives of the past. The genius of Anglo-Saxon liberty, when\r\nshe emigrated to these shores, bore twins in her bosom and not a single\r\nbirth. The Northern race, bold, hardy, intelligent, proud and free, will\r\nreceive into its embrace the heterogeneous spawn of European\r\ncivilization, and mold it to its own shape, and prepare it for its own\r\ndestiny. The Southern people are brave, courteous and gentle, credulous\r\nand forbearing--loving friends, chivalrous enemies and good masters, to\r\nwhose strong and generous hands alone the Almighty would entrust the\r\ntutelage of his most helpless and degraded children.\r\n\r\nThe time for our separation has come, and let all good men unite to\r\navert the calamity of civil war. But at all hazards the dissolution must\r\ncome. The evolution of history, according to the laws of Providence,\r\nwhich supervise even the falling of a sparrow, necessitates it and\r\ndemands it. The diversity of character, opinion, interest, climate and\r\ninstitutions in the two sections is beyond remedy. Each has a separate\r\nmission to fill and a glorious destiny to accomplish. In our present\r\nrelations, we incommode each other, threaten the peace of the world, and\r\nretard the operations of Providence. Let us part in peace; let us have\r\nan equitable distribution of the public property and the public\r\nterritory; let us have an alliance offensive and defensive; let us scorn\r\nthe idea, so mournfully entertained by many, that constitutional liberty\r\nwill perish because we are divorced, that representative government will\r\nprove a failure because it becomes our duty and interest to separate.\r\nLet us prove by our wisdom and our courage that those great principles\r\nare dearer and more powerful than ever. Let us emulate each other only\r\nin the arts of peace, in the cultivation of friendship and in the\r\nworship of God.\r\n\r\nIt is unfair to represent this question as one of secession or\r\nsubmission. The word submission, in the sense of political degredation,\r\ndoes not exist in the Southern vocabulary. There is no man in the South\r\nso stupid, so cowardly, so base as to be willing to live in the Union as\r\nit is. There is no difference between us as to the fanaticism and\r\ntyranny of the North, no difference as to the wrongs and injuries of the\r\nSouth. Some of us would secede at once, unconditionally and forever.\r\nOthers would give the North a last chance to abandon her false position,\r\nto make apologies and amend, and to secure us in the strongest bonds\r\nimaginable, against not only the encroachments but the existence of the\r\nRepublican party. The difference is rather nominal than real, for all\r\nthe conservatives doubt and many despair of proper concessions from the\r\nNorth. With those concessions, disunion is probable, without them it is\r\ninevitable.\r\n\r\nIt is the business of the Cotton States to move first in this important\r\nmatter. They alone are the great conservators of the institution of\r\nslavery. The people of Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky and Missouri are\r\nunquestionably with us in spirit and principle, but we cannot disguise\r\nthe fact, that the tenure of our social system in those States is feeble\r\nand failing. Those great communities must do as in their wisdom they see\r\nbest, but we cannot wait for their decision nor promise to abide by it.\r\nWhether they go with the North or declare for a separate sovereignty,\r\nthe mission of the Cotton States must be equally accomplished. We\r\ncordially invite their co-operation and believe they will share largely\r\nand richly in the benefits of a Southern Confederacy, and in event of\r\ntrouble, we pledge our lives and fortunes to the defence of their\r\nborder.\r\n\r\nTo the professed Abolitionists, that motley crew of men who should be\r\nwomen and of women who should be men; who see in Fred Douglass a hero\r\nand in John Brown a martyr, whose venom is proportioned to their\r\nignorance, as some animals are said to be fiercest in the dark; and who\r\nare ready to perpetrate the blackest crimes in the name of liberty and\r\nunder the garb of virtue, we have _nothing_ to say.\r\n\r\nThe Republican party itself, the best and the worst of it, we charge\r\nwith having outraged our feelings, violated our rights, and initiated a\r\npolicy which, if carried out, will be destructive of our liberties. It\r\nis not an election but a usurpation, and if we acquiesce, we are not\r\ncitizens but subjects. The forms of constitutional liberty may have been\r\nobserved, but the spirit of tyrannic dictation has been the presiding\r\ngenius of the day. Suppose the people of the North were to repeal their\r\nobnoxious laws, to confirm and abide by the decision of the Supreme\r\nCourt, to divide the territories in an equitable manner, and to\r\nrecognize the equality as well as the Union of the States, what and\r\nwhere would the Republican party be? Dissipated into thin air, dissolved\r\nlike an empty pageant, not leaving a trace behind. With the Republican\r\nparty, therefore, as it exists at this hour we have no parley. If it\r\nquestions us, we have no reply, but the words of the gallant Georgian.\r\n\"Argument is exhausted, we stand to our arms.\"\r\n\r\nTo the conservative men of the North, who sacrificed their time,\r\ntreasure, interest and popularity in our behalf, and who have proffered\r\ntheir blood in our defence, we have no language which can truly express\r\nthe gratitude of our hearts. Generous and faithful spirits! Stand\r\nbravely a little longer in the imminent deadly breach, which is yawning\r\nbetween the North and the South, and stay, if it yet be possible, the\r\nbloody hand of fanaticism. Raise your eloquent voices once more for\r\nequality and fraternity, for justice and union. If it prove in vain, as\r\nalas! it will, keep firm at least to your principles and your faith;\r\nwork without ceasing as a leaven of good in your infatuated communities;\r\ninfuse into the contest before us some chivalric element, worthy of\r\nyourselves and of us, which, if the worst comes, shall mitigate the\r\nhorrors of war, and hasten the returning blessings of peace. When we\r\nthink of you in the future, we will forget the violence of individuals\r\nand the disloyalty of State governments; we will forget the calumnies of\r\nSumner and Phillips and Giddings, the blasphemies of Emerson and Cheever\r\nand Beecher, and the vile stings and insults of the aiders and abettors\r\nof thieves and assassins; we will willingly forget them all, and entwine\r\nyou tenderly in our memories and affections, with the immortal friends\r\nand compatriots of our own revolutionary sires--with Otis and Warren,\r\nand Hancock and Putnam, and Wayne and Hamilton and Franklin. And in the\r\nfearful troubles which may come also upon your fragment of this\r\ndismembered nation, may the sign of our covenant be found upon every one\r\nof your door-posts, to ward off the destroying angel from your favored\r\nand happy homes!\r\n\r\nSoutherners! In this great crisis which involves the welfare of the\r\npresent and the future, let us be united as one man. Let us survey the\r\nwhole question in all its bearings, immediate and prospective. Let us\r\nact calmly, wisely, bravely. Let us take counsel of our duty and our\r\nhonor, and not of our danger and our fears. Let us invoke the guardian\r\nspirit of ancestral virtue, and the blessing of Almighty God. Let us\r\nremember that, although precipitancy is a fault, it is better, in a\r\nquestion so vital as personal and national independence, to be an age\r\ntoo soon than a moment too late. If we succeed in establishing, _as we\r\nshall_, a vast, opulent, happy and glorious slave-holding Republic,\r\nthroughout tropical America--future generations will arise and call us\r\nblessed! But if it be possible, in the mysterious providence of God,\r\nthat we should fail and perish in our sublime attempt, let it come! Our\r\nsouls may rebel against the inscrutable decree of such a destiny, but we\r\nwill not swerve a line from the luminous path of duty. With our hands\r\nupon our hearts we will unitedly exclaim, let it come! The sons and\r\ndaughters of the South are ready for the sacrifice. We endorse the noble\r\nsentiment of Robert Hall, that he has already lived too long who has\r\nsurvived the liberties of his country!\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM H.
